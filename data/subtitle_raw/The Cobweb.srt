1
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,619
Can I give you a ride?

2
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:13,342
All the way into town?

3
00:02:13,402 --> 00:02:15,896
I turn north at heatherton.

4
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:18,006
What are those for?
A funeral?

5
00:02:18,102 --> 00:02:19,924
Why do flowers have
to be for anything?

6
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,190
Isn't it enough that
they have color and form

7
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:23,760
and that they make
you feel good?

8
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:25,199
You talk a lot, don't you?

9
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:26,637
Don't you, ever?

10
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:29,646
I could talk your eyes
out of your head.

11
00:02:29,706 --> 00:02:31,564
But not small talk.

12
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:34,633
I'd be grateful to hear any talk
at all these days.

13
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,707
Talk big.

14
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:39,105
Red and green.

15
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,311
Duran died last fall
in a hospital.

16
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:43,420
You wouldn't know who he was.

17
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:44,703
It happens I do.

18
00:02:44,763 --> 00:02:46,717
- Who?
- A French painter.

19
00:02:46,777 --> 00:02:48,503
One of Les fauves.

20
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,531
He died in a hospital
in a white bed in a white room,

21
00:02:52,627 --> 00:02:54,198
doctors in white
standing around.

22
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:59,568
The last thing he said was,
"some red, show me some red.

23
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:02,409
"Before dying, I want to see
some red with some green."

24
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:06,090
You're right.
You don't have small talk.

25
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,200
Artists are better off dead.

26
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,219
Why?

27
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,173
People pay more
attention to them

28
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,534
when they're dead
and not so troublesome.

29
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,392
Is that what you are? A painter?

30
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:18,617
They said Van Gogh
was crazy because he killed himself.

31
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:20,735
He couldn't sell a painting
while he was alive,

32
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:23,304
and now they're
worth $30 million.

33
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,673
They weren't that bad then
and they're not that good now

34
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:28,399
so, who's crazy?

35
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:29,970
I get out here.

36
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,564
You're from the clinic.

37
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,244
That's right.
I'm "out of touch with reality."

38
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:37,223
I'll take you up.

39
00:03:38,661 --> 00:03:40,999
Are you being helped here?

40
00:03:41,059 --> 00:03:42,497
How should I know?

41
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:44,607
If you don't, who does?

42
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:46,849
My analyst thinks he does.

43
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:50,170
Man: The fact which
I should like to convey

44
00:03:50,266 --> 00:03:52,855
in this report to the trustees

45
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:55,732
is that our patients
now, more and more,

46
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:57,650
are shouldering
the responsibility

47
00:03:57,746 --> 00:04:00,275
for their own affairs
in the hospital.

48
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:03,344
In dealing with the, ah,
borderline patients,

49
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:05,646
that is to say the people
who find it difficult

50
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:09,278
to cope with the normal strains
of living, and in whom the,

51
00:04:09,339 --> 00:04:12,671
ah, the danger of a psychotic
break is always present...

52
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:15,488
Mrs. Demuth.

53
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:17,215
Man: All right.
We'll go on after that.

54
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,941
You've changed
Steven Holte to 5:00.

55
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:21,626
Oh, yeah. Well, I'll
work on it by myself tonight.

56
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,580
Patients' committee
meeting...8:30.

57
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,038
I know. Bedtime... 2:30.

58
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,162
Mrs. Demuth.
Dr. Mciver will see you now.

59
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:35,724
Mr. Holcomb is disturbed.

60
00:04:37,738 --> 00:04:39,656
So is Mrs. Oâ€™Brien.

61
00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:51,644
Mr. Holcomb!

62
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:56,535
Mr. Holcomb, are you all right?

63
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:03,248
Mr. Holcomb.
This is Dr. Devanal.

64
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,838
Devanal: I'd like
to talk to you.

65
00:05:05,934 --> 00:05:07,468
Would you open the door, please?

66
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:10,057
Mr. Holcomb.

67
00:05:10,154 --> 00:05:12,935
Shall I use my key, doctor?

68
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:14,661
What brought this on,
do you know?

69
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:15,848
He was pretty incoherent.

70
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:17,346
Something about the gardener.

71
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,684
- Curly?
- Yes. He felt he'd insulted him.

72
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:22,082
- When did this happen?
- Just a few moments ago.

73
00:05:22,142 --> 00:05:24,347
Shall I send curly to you?

74
00:05:24,443 --> 00:05:27,224
No, no. Is miss inch
in her office?

75
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,238
She was in the library
the last time I saw her.

76
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:31,348
Well, keep talking to him
and try to get him

77
00:05:31,444 --> 00:05:33,458
to open the door.
I'll be back.

78
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:35,089
What's the price of this?

79
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:37,774
That's cotton wrap.
You wouldn't be happy with that.

80
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,021
What's wrong with it?

81
00:05:39,117 --> 00:05:40,939
Well, there's
nothing wrong with it

82
00:05:41,035 --> 00:05:44,093
but as long as you're investing
in drapes for a room like this,

83
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:46,022
why, you should have
a cheerful pattern.

84
00:05:46,118 --> 00:05:47,592
Otherwise, you'd be better off

85
00:05:47,652 --> 00:05:49,606
to let these old ones
make do until you...

86
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,159
well, it was not my idea
to replace the drapes,

87
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,078
the board makes these decisions.

88
00:05:54,173 --> 00:05:55,996
I'm responsible for
getting things done

89
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:57,338
as economically as possible.

90
00:05:57,434 --> 00:05:59,300
So I want to know what
this would add up to.

91
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,467
Well, that wrap is
$2.99 a yard plus sales tax.

92
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,718
191.36, less our discount.

93
00:06:05,778 --> 00:06:07,984
Vicky. May I see you a moment?

94
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,820
12.5% on 191.365 times...

95
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:18,629
167.44 plus 3%
sales tax...5.02... 176.46 total!

96
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:21,602
Devanal: How's my best girl?

97
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:23,328
Up to my...

98
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,570
Vicky, we've got a situation here.
I need your help.

99
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,177
It's about curly.
It seems he has...

100
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:28,816
what do you want me to do?
Fire him?

101
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:29,958
He's been here 20 years.

102
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:32,775
Cost you twice as much to get
anyone else to do half the work.

103
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:34,282
Vicky, please.
You know very well

104
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:35,917
he won't listen to
anybody but you.

105
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:37,199
He's upset another patient.

106
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:38,993
And the last thing
in the world we want,

107
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:41,127
with the trustees coming
down next week, is a...

108
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,976
well, anytime the board doesn't
like the way I run my department...

109
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:45,031
Vicky, Vicky.

110
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:46,978
Everyone knows you do
wonders around here.

111
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,779
Well, do a tiny wonder for
me, now.

112
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,505
Tell curly to behave
with the patients.

113
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:55,492
Anything. Just so I can tell Holcomb
he's apologized. Hmm?

114
00:06:55,552 --> 00:06:58,333
Go on! Work your magic!

115
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,443
Oh, Vicky.

116
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,074
Why don't you let me leave these

117
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:04,603
chintz samples here
for you to think over?

118
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:06,765
I don't think you're
going to be happy with that.

119
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:08,760
What's all this concern
about my being happy?

120
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,446
I have no intention of dancing
through the halls, shrieking

121
00:07:11,507 --> 00:07:13,810
with laughter because we're
changing a set of drapes.

122
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,612
Now, then, leave
a duplicate order blank.

123
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:16,867
Let you know in a few days.

124
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:18,497
Ok, Vicky!

125
00:07:29,214 --> 00:07:33,182
Well, there it is.
The house of Usher.

126
00:07:33,242 --> 00:07:37,462
They talk of environmental therapy.
Some environment!

127
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:38,901
You should see the inside.

128
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:40,627
Like the inside of a dead fish!

129
00:07:40,723 --> 00:07:41,970
Right now, miss inch...

130
00:07:42,065 --> 00:07:43,984
you live in town,
you've heard of miss inch...

131
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:46,493
her old man shot buffalo bill or
somebody right near here.

132
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:47,640
Ha ha! I've heard of her.

133
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:48,970
Well, she's getting ready

134
00:07:49,066 --> 00:07:50,697
to hang new drapes
in the library.

135
00:07:50,793 --> 00:07:53,766
One look, and all the patients will hang
themselves alongside them.

136
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:54,913
Everybody's tilted here.

137
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,587
That's why you didn't
know who I was.

138
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:58,521
You can't tell the patients
from the doctors.

139
00:07:58,581 --> 00:08:00,383
- Oh, but I can.
- How?

140
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,918
The patients get better!

141
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:03,260
Ha ha!

142
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:06,233
Thanks for the ride.

143
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:08,055
You're welcome.

144
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,580
And that evening,
we put her on the boat train for America.

145
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:20,751
Well! As you can imagine,

146
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:22,765
our joy and relief
was indescribable,

147
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:26,121
and we boarded the plane for Italy
happy and carefree as children.

148
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:28,231
I can see you've already
guessed what happened!

149
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:31,198
Well, sure enough, when we
landed at the airport in Rome,

150
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,040
we were greeted by the appalling sight
of miss Dalrymple waving hysterically.

151
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,606
Well, the rest of the trip was agony.
She literally...

152
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,228
Man:... Mrs. Dalrymple or I.

153
00:09:07,324 --> 00:09:09,626
Well, finally,
we found a handsome young Italian...

154
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:10,968
Ah, Mrs. Mciver!

155
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:12,791
Oh! Dr. Wolff, how nice.

156
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,421
A most unusual pleasure

157
00:09:14,517 --> 00:09:15,668
seeing you in the clinic.

158
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:16,915
And how's, ah, um...

159
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,024
Mrs. Wolff is very well,
thank you.

160
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,463
I tried to phone...

161
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,493
Stewart's been so busy
we haven't seen anyone.

162
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:23,572
Oh, I understand.

163
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:25,921
Well, sometime very, very soon!

164
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:37,438
Stewart, I...

165
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:38,685
oh! I'm so sorry!

166
00:09:38,781 --> 00:09:39,836
I didn't hear anyone.

167
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:41,259
Karen, can't you see I'm busy?

168
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,516
I do beg your pardon.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

169
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:45,750
But I've just had an idea,
the most wonderful idea...

170
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:48,064
look, you know better than
to bust in here like this.

171
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:49,375
But, darling, it's after 5:00.

172
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:50,626
I thought you were through.

173
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:51,969
Ok, ok.

174
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:02,768
...your wife,
who looks as if anybody breathed

175
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:05,598
on her she'd break
out in a thick frost!

176
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:08,319
What is she?
A nymphomaniac or something?

177
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:10,908
What did you marry her for, anyway?
To wear on your lapel?

178
00:10:13,402 --> 00:10:15,224
Why are you so worried about me?

179
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,197
Who's worried about you?
I'm worried about me.

180
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:23,856
All right,
I'm a charity patient.

181
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:26,289
You've got to have me
for taxes or something,

182
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:29,514
but you're still supposed to be
making me fit for normal life!

183
00:10:30,569 --> 00:10:32,870
What's normal? Yours?

184
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,784
If it's a question
of values, your values stink.

185
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:39,488
Lousy, middle-class,
well-fed, smug existence.

186
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:42,365
All you care about is
a paycheck you didn't earn

187
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:45,242
and a beautiful thing
to go home to every night.

188
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:47,832
Stewart, darling!
Welcome home!

189
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:50,037
There's a fatted calf
on the stove!

190
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:55,983
This started before
she came in, though.

191
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,381
What's that?
An interpretation or something?

192
00:10:58,477 --> 00:11:01,582
It doesn't go
very deep, does it?

193
00:11:01,642 --> 00:11:04,747
Why don't you analyze my Oedipus
complex with my lousy father?

194
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:07,971
Suppose we let me
determine the course of treatment, eh?

195
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,889
After all, this is
your first case.

196
00:11:09,985 --> 00:11:12,575
Don't you know how to do
any ID analysis here?

197
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,493
Isn't that the
classic procedure?

198
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:15,931
You're not a classic case.

199
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:17,658
Oh, insults now.

200
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:21,913
Stevie, since you
mention my values,

201
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:25,234
they include sitting here listening
to the bull you throw at me.

202
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,152
And I don't get more
than a little mad,

203
00:11:27,248 --> 00:11:29,010
and I don't say "forget it."

204
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,449
Because one of my values

205
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:33,290
is not to toss in the sponge on
human commitments.

206
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:39,811
You have a genius
for belittling the world, Stevie.

207
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,401
Great. I'm glad you think
it's worth something.

208
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:44,451
You reduce me to
a fictitious character,

209
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,333
a predatory dolt.

210
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:48,251
This is what you do
to people and then

211
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:50,169
you wonder why you
can't relate to Th...

212
00:11:50,265 --> 00:11:52,794
what a collection
of junky platitudes!

213
00:11:52,854 --> 00:11:55,348
I don't know, maybe
you're sore at me

214
00:11:55,444 --> 00:11:58,225
because you haven't got a woman
of your own, a home of your own...

215
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:00,335
Oh, stop it.
You're so brilliant.

216
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,596
I seem to be missing
a piece here.

217
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:05,034
I can't quite understand...

218
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,624
she gave me a lift
in that station wagon.

219
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,597
Did you know who she was?

220
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:14,337
Who do you think
you are, Stevie?

221
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,639
You're no different
from anybody else.

222
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,365
She's a good-looking woman.

223
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:22,125
Why shouldn't you have
certain thoughts about it?

224
00:12:22,186 --> 00:12:26,289
You don't have to feel guilty
toward me or even afraid.

225
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:32,559
I'm not your father, Stevie.

226
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:37,546
And I'm not going
to run out on you like your father.

227
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:42,341
There's something
in the world besides betrayal.

228
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:52,794
What did you...Say?

229
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:05,550
Oh, Regina,
it's so funny! Ha ha!

230
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:09,578
Oh, yes, but this is
a new low in taste even for Vicky.

231
00:13:09,674 --> 00:13:11,688
A dismal, dreary old
piece of wreck

232
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:14,121
you wouldn't even use
for washing the car.

233
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:16,866
Well, it's such a pity.
It's a beautiful old room,

234
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,355
and, well, that's where
I thought you could help me.

235
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:22,656
You have such beautiful
shops in Chicago,

236
00:13:22,716 --> 00:13:24,922
and we have nothing here
but poor old Petlee's.

237
00:13:26,073 --> 00:13:28,279
Well, I found myself visualizing

238
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,293
what I would choose
if it were left to me.

239
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:32,019
Well, you know that's fatal.

240
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:34,355
They shouldn't allow
me within 100 miles

241
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:36,754
of materials when there's
a budget involved.

242
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:39,056
Oh, well, Regina,
that's so sweet of you,

243
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:41,130
but it's not strictly true.

244
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:45,733
If I have any taste at all, it's because
I've absorbed everything you've taught me.

245
00:13:46,597 --> 00:13:47,939
Well! Do you remember...

246
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:56,283
Daddy!

247
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,333
R-r-Rosie!

248
00:13:58,393 --> 00:14:00,647
Mommy said I could stay
up until you got home.

249
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,996
That's swell.
I'll tuck you in myself. Hi, mark!

250
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,055
Hi, dad!

251
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:05,473
How are you?
Oh, uh, excuse me!

252
00:14:05,669 --> 00:14:08,299
Listen, do you think you could
square things with Sadie for me?

253
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:09,342
Sure!

254
00:14:09,438 --> 00:14:11,992
Ask her to get me something to eat.
I got to get right back.

255
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,066
- Ok.
- Good. Oowhaah!

256
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:14,349
Daddy, will you come up and

257
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:15,827
kiss me good night
before you go?

258
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:18,193
Well, I sure will.
I wouldn't miss that for the world.

259
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:19,587
Will you read me a story?

260
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:21,026
I'll read you a short one.

261
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:22,405
Daddy, what can we play?

262
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:23,939
How's about a little cribbage?

263
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,397
Ha ha!
Stay home tonight.

264
00:14:26,493 --> 00:14:28,794
Now, are you sure
you have the measurements?

265
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,889
Right.

266
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:33,050
How long will...
yes, air express.

267
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,435
Oh, but Regina, how could you possibly
get them here for the meeting Tuesday?

268
00:14:37,496 --> 00:14:40,207
Well, how on earth can he
make them that quickly?

269
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:43,120
Oh, how wonderful!
He must be a mad genius!

270
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,490
Good evening, darling.
I'll be with you in a minute.

271
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:47,975
That was Stewart.

272
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:50,373
No, I haven't had a chance
to tell him yet. I...

273
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:52,387
I don't know.
He may think I...

274
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:54,628
oh! Thank you. Thanks.

275
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:57,202
As a matter of fact,
I think myself he'll be pleased.

276
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,484
It's the first time I've
done anything for the...

277
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,169
oh, Regina, you're the most
extravagant, fabulous...

278
00:15:03,224 --> 00:15:05,046
all right, darling.
You'll let me know?

279
00:15:05,142 --> 00:15:07,156
And I'll leave word
if I'm not at home.

280
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:10,225
Good-bye, darling,
and thank you!

281
00:15:11,568 --> 00:15:13,138
Have you got a moment?

282
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:14,349
Sure. I'm all ears.

283
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:17,166
Oh, darling, this is important.
Please sit down.

284
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:18,377
I'm sorry.
Go ahead, shoot.

285
00:15:18,473 --> 00:15:20,427
I had an inspiration
this afternoon.

286
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,405
At least, I think it is.

287
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:24,419
How do you like this?

288
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:26,756
Chippendale rose
on antique satin.

289
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:28,155
It's very pretty.
What's it for?

290
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:29,981
Well, I first thought
of it this afternoon

291
00:15:30,077 --> 00:15:31,807
when I picked up that
wild Fawn of yours.

292
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:34,565
In fact, that's what I came
bursting in your office to tell you.

293
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:35,668
I'm sorry I was so curt.

294
00:15:35,764 --> 00:15:38,694
Oh, that's all right. I didn't...
listening to what you hear in there,

295
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:40,799
you get to feel it's a
little like a confessional.

296
00:15:40,859 --> 00:15:42,202
That's a very high-strung boy.

297
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:43,241
Yes, I understand.

298
00:15:43,336 --> 00:15:45,370
He's very attractive.
As I say, he's the one...

299
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,080
the feeling was mutual.

300
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,546
You made quite an impression.

301
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,499
- Really?
- Mmm.

302
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,554
What did he say?

303
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:54,149
Well, it got a little
complicated.

304
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,067
What went on with him?

305
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,985
Nothing.
We just talked.

306
00:15:58,081 --> 00:15:59,520
Did he tell you about it?

307
00:15:59,615 --> 00:16:01,438
Just about all of it.

308
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:03,931
Well, why do you
ask what went on?

309
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:07,959
Because I'm not sure what he thought
went on is what you thought went on.

310
00:16:08,055 --> 00:16:10,069
He thought you were
flirting with him.

311
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:11,987
Is that what you think?

312
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,522
Karen.

313
00:16:13,617 --> 00:16:16,380
This boy leads a very active
fantasy life with ladies.

314
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:18,640
He got going on you and
I couldn't stop him!

315
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,043
Is that my fault?
I didn't...

316
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:21,997
I wasn't really
thinking about you, Karen.

317
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:23,404
It's my job to think about him.

318
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,974
And what he felt,
not what I feel!

319
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:27,811
I'm not worrying about you!
I am about him.

320
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:29,442
When he saw you were my wife,

321
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:31,779
he got very scared,
went on the attack.

322
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,620
Said a lot of wild things about you,
about me.

323
00:16:34,716 --> 00:16:35,963
What things?

324
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:37,689
It doesn't matter what things.

325
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:40,183
I've told you too much about
him already.

326
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,509
But you listen to them!

327
00:16:41,605 --> 00:16:44,403
Of course I listen to them!
What do you think I'm there for?

328
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:46,512
And because they're
too sacred to tell me,

329
00:16:46,608 --> 00:16:48,143
I get no chance
to reply to them?

330
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,061
Who expects you to?

331
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:53,034
Look, Karen.
Don't be so full of your feelings.

332
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,144
The point I'm making
is that this boy

333
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,906
has put his life in my hands.

334
00:16:56,966 --> 00:16:59,939
I'm concerned about him, as I am
about everything at the clinic.

335
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,519
You might try to understand
that and share it.

336
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,214
I am trying to!
I came in this afternoon without...

337
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,510
by being so self-absorbed you
interrupt an hour?

338
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,237
I apologized for that.

339
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:12,155
And while you're
in your confessional

340
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:13,881
being a divinity
to your sick boy,

341
00:17:13,941 --> 00:17:15,607
what am I supposed to be doing?

342
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,818
You're not supposed to be

343
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:18,544
showing yourself off
to my patients!

344
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,381
Give me one ounce of the attention
you give them day and night!

345
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,011
Now, what does that mean?

346
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:26,121
Just what you think it means!

347
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:45,529
How did the tournament go?

348
00:17:45,589 --> 00:17:47,447
Fine. I'm in the semi-finals
playing conover.

349
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:48,886
Ooh, he's a tough one.

350
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:50,516
Hello, Sadie.

351
00:17:50,576 --> 00:17:51,823
Good evening.

352
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,393
Oh, just skip the soup, Sadie.

353
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:54,508
It's your favorite.

354
00:17:54,604 --> 00:17:56,179
Yeah, I know.
I don't have much time.

355
00:17:56,239 --> 00:17:57,617
Just put something on a plate.

356
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,135
All right.

357
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,354
How long did you play?

358
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,140
Two hours.
Then we adjourned.

359
00:18:03,236 --> 00:18:05,825
Hmm. You playing white?

360
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:07,168
Mm-hmm.

361
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:09,661
Looks like you've got a mate there if
you play it right.

362
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,483
What's your next move?

363
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:14,169
Well, I was going
to sacrifice my rook.

364
00:18:14,265 --> 00:18:15,991
That's pretty fancy.
What for?

365
00:18:16,087 --> 00:18:19,635
I take the Bishop with my rook
and his rook has to take mine.

366
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,553
Then I bring my queen
to knight 4

367
00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:23,951
and threaten mate in one move.

368
00:18:24,047 --> 00:18:27,116
Well! You know,
I think I'd better take up checkers!

369
00:18:35,076 --> 00:18:37,186
- Sadie!
- Yes, sir?

370
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,337
Where's the Brandy?

371
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:39,775
Oh, it's on this side.

372
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:40,830
Oh, thank you.

373
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:42,365
With Martinis?

374
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,995
Sure! Why not?

375
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:01,545
What's tonight?

376
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,888
The concert.

377
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:05,381
Oh, Karen.
I'm sorry, I forgot.

378
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,911
I've got a patients' meeting.

379
00:19:07,971 --> 00:19:09,637
Wouldn't tomorrow
night do as well?

380
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:12,478
It's their meeting.
I can't switch it around to suit myself.

381
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:13,825
It involves a dozen patients.

382
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:15,164
Well, can't Dev take it?

383
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,853
Oh, you know Dev.
Besides, this is my department.

384
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:20,402
I've been looking forward
to this for one week.

385
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,447
Look, I'll call
Meg Rinehart and ask her

386
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:25,749
to take the meeting if
it's that important to you.

387
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:27,439
It isn't, really.

388
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:30,892
I'm sorry, kare.

389
00:19:30,988 --> 00:19:32,522
I'm sorry, too.

390
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:45,601
Mr. Appleton, if you please.

391
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:47,096
Appleton: Very well,
Mr. Holcomb.

392
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:48,739
We're not going to get
anywhere unless

393
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:50,652
we follow rules of
parliamentary procedure.

394
00:19:50,748 --> 00:19:53,142
If everyone speaks at once,
it becomes very disorderly.

395
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:55,192
Please wait until
I recognize somebody.

396
00:19:55,252 --> 00:19:57,745
Man: Well, hurry up.
Recognize somebody.

397
00:19:57,841 --> 00:19:59,080
Holcomb: I recognize myself,

398
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:01,435
which I believe I have every
right to do. And I am...

399
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:03,822
woman: Oh, let someone else
talk for a change, Holcomb.

400
00:20:03,883 --> 00:20:05,933
You blew your top
this afternoon.

401
00:20:05,993 --> 00:20:08,339
Miss Demuth,
that is rude and uncalled for.

402
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,632
What's more,
if you don't like the way I...

403
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:13,661
I'm sorry. I... I am
sometimes a little dictatorial.

404
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:16,350
That's a fault I have...
I...I'm working on it.

405
00:20:16,446 --> 00:20:18,077
Work harder.

406
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,666
Man: Oh, Dr. Mciver!

407
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,872
Sorry I'm late.

408
00:20:22,968 --> 00:20:24,119
Oh, please, go right ahead.

409
00:20:24,215 --> 00:20:27,859
Dr. Mciver, they're all confusing
occupational therapy with common labor.

410
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:30,420
Girl: Let's ask Dr. Mciver
what he thinks.

411
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:33,002
Sounds like a very vital topic.
What is it?

412
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:39,979
Holcomb: Quiet! Quiet!

413
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,380
Mr. Appleton,
you are being very difficult.

414
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,774
Actually, it was Mrs.
Rinehart's department.

415
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,081
Perhaps she would summarize.

416
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:47,999
No. Innocent bystander.

417
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:49,917
Well, Mrs. Jenkins,
then. It was her idea.

418
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:51,391
I had the impression
it was mine.

419
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:52,890
We both had the idea.

420
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:56,100
I was talking to Mrs. Rinehart this
afternoon about how there were going

421
00:20:56,161 --> 00:20:58,836
to be new drapes in the library
when this scheme occurred to me.

422
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:01,243
Then we discovered that Lois
had had the same thought

423
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:03,024
when she was talking
to Mrs. Rinehart...

424
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:04,355
I still think mine came first.

425
00:21:04,415 --> 00:21:06,273
Who had the idea first
is completely, uh...

426
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,366
- Irrelevant?
- Irrelevant.

427
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:10,860
The point is, we could
make them ourselves.

428
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,934
The patients, I mean.
A group project.

429
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,475
Girl: They'd be all our
own from beginning to end

430
00:21:15,536 --> 00:21:17,921
and Stevie Holte could
make some original designs

431
00:21:18,017 --> 00:21:19,717
and we'd put them
together and sew them.

432
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,665
Everybody's in favor of
it except Mr. Holcomb.

433
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:23,004
Now, now, just a moment.

434
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,401
I did not say that I was not
in favor of them.

435
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:27,223
I merely raised the question...

436
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,954
does Mrs. Rinehart
think it's workable?

437
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,101
Might be.

438
00:21:30,197 --> 00:21:32,210
You don't sound
too enthusiastic.

439
00:21:32,306 --> 00:21:33,270
I don't mean to.

440
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:34,548
It's an interesting idea.

441
00:21:34,608 --> 00:21:36,047
Girl: It's a wonderful idea!

442
00:21:36,143 --> 00:21:39,343
And you say Stevie Holte wants
to do the designs?

443
00:21:39,403 --> 00:21:40,650
Girl: Yes.

444
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:41,897
Oh, thank you.

445
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:43,947
- Stevie?
- Yes?

446
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,098
Can you?

447
00:21:45,158 --> 00:21:46,736
We figure on using
unbleached muslin.

448
00:21:46,796 --> 00:21:48,322
Which I could wipe my feet on

449
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:49,893
and it would look
better than those.

450
00:21:49,953 --> 00:21:51,523
Oh, is that the plan?

451
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,770
No!

452
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,995
No, the plan is to do designs of
our own lives here.

453
00:21:56,091 --> 00:21:57,757
I don't know
what they'll be yet.

454
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,593
But when we get them up, it'll look like
our living room and not miss inch's.

455
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,955
What makes you so confident?

456
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:06,161
Isn't that obvious?
I'm scared stiff!

457
00:22:06,256 --> 00:22:08,306
Does that mean all right on the
drapes, doctor?

458
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:09,613
It means all right so far.

459
00:22:17,573 --> 00:22:19,623
Quiet! Mr. Appleton,
in the name of heaven!

460
00:22:19,683 --> 00:22:21,217
Excuse me, doctor.

461
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:23,171
Holcomb: We're still
without any decision

462
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:25,629
as to whether this is
an administrative problem,

463
00:22:25,725 --> 00:22:27,679
in which case we should
consult Dr. Devanal...

464
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:29,985
well, for the moment let's
say it's a clinical matter

465
00:22:30,046 --> 00:22:31,963
since I'm here tonight
and Dr. Devanal isn't.

466
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,402
Now, uh...

467
00:22:55,935 --> 00:22:57,757
Right over there.

468
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,972
Operator: Calling 4-1098.
Calling Mrs. Mciver.

469
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:05,333
Yes, this is Mrs. Mciver.

470
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:06,388
What?

471
00:23:06,484 --> 00:23:08,114
Oh! Regina!

472
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,992
I thought it was something wrong
with the children!

473
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:13,102
What? On the plane tomorrow?

474
00:23:13,197 --> 00:23:14,540
I don't believe it.

475
00:23:14,636 --> 00:23:16,686
Oh, Regina, you're
a miracle worker.

476
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:18,856
Vicky inch? Oh,
don't worry about her.

477
00:23:18,952 --> 00:23:20,870
I'll call her at once
and tell her.

478
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,144
She's no problem.

479
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:24,262
Oh, Regina, darling!
Thank you so terribly much.

480
00:23:24,322 --> 00:23:25,665
And we'll see you
next week then.

481
00:23:25,761 --> 00:23:27,103
Good-bye.

482
00:23:41,297 --> 00:23:42,640
Yes, who is it?

483
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:44,942
Mrs. Mciver: Vicky,
this is Karen Mciver.

484
00:23:45,997 --> 00:23:47,071
Yes?

485
00:23:47,131 --> 00:23:49,393
I'd like to discuss something
with you for the clinic.

486
00:23:49,453 --> 00:23:50,779
How have you been?

487
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:52,326
Satisfactory.

488
00:23:52,422 --> 00:23:54,229
Darling,
could you speak a trifle louder?

489
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,294
I'm calling in the
intermission of the concert.

490
00:23:56,354 --> 00:23:58,712
Everyone in town is galloping up and
down the corridor.

491
00:23:58,772 --> 00:23:59,711
Close the booth!

492
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:01,251
Whew! I can't. I'll perish.

493
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:02,388
It's quite sultry here.

494
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:05,046
I never understand why this place
cannot be air-conditioned.

495
00:24:05,106 --> 00:24:06,045
Inch: Money.

496
00:24:06,141 --> 00:24:07,192
What, darling?

497
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:08,250
Inch: I said money.

498
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:09,301
How are you?

499
00:24:09,397 --> 00:24:10,727
Inch: I told you satisfactory!

500
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:11,834
Do you want one of these?

501
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:13,882
No, but thanks so much.
I'll see you all later.

502
00:24:13,942 --> 00:24:14,881
Inch: Karen!

503
00:24:14,976 --> 00:24:17,002
Yes, Vicky. I'm calling about
the library drapes.

504
00:24:17,098 --> 00:24:18,372
I've been talking with Regina.

505
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:19,376
Inch: Who?

506
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:21,908
Regina Mitchell-Smythe.
She has this material.

507
00:24:21,969 --> 00:24:23,644
I have a swatch here
she let me have.

508
00:24:23,705 --> 00:24:25,893
Well, if she'd let us have
a few swatches of money

509
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:27,427
it would be more to the point.

510
00:24:27,523 --> 00:24:29,841
Vicky, I don't think the money
should be an obstacle.

511
00:24:29,937 --> 00:24:30,911
Shouldn't it?

512
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,277
Last year the clinic spent over $100
just on thumbtacks.

513
00:24:33,373 --> 00:24:34,716
Thumbtacks?

514
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:35,963
And paper clips.

515
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,209
We can't afford them.

516
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:39,319
Vicky, you're being
simply obstructive!

517
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:40,566
Am I?

518
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,964
Karen, there are
channels for doing things here.

519
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:44,210
I am beginning to doubt.

520
00:24:44,306 --> 00:24:46,512
And traditions which newcomers

521
00:24:46,608 --> 00:24:48,718
may not be familiar with.

522
00:24:50,252 --> 00:24:53,513
Vicky, are you referring
to Dr. Mciver and myself?

523
00:24:53,705 --> 00:24:55,821
I'm certainly referring to
Regina Mitchell-Smythe,

524
00:24:55,882 --> 00:24:58,925
who seems not to know that I do
the decorating at the clinic.

525
00:24:58,986 --> 00:25:01,281
She has been chairman of
the board for 5 years.

526
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:02,756
Sprung up like a toadstool.

527
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:03,775
What?

528
00:25:03,871 --> 00:25:05,213
Toadstool!
Overnight.

529
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:07,427
Regina Mitchell-Smythe is
a most influential woman

530
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:08,994
and works very hard
for the clinic.

531
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:10,105
No harder than I do.

532
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,830
I've been with the clinic longer
than anyone except Dr. Devanal.

533
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,359
I remember when the late
Dr. Sanford Collins founded it.

534
00:25:15,455 --> 00:25:18,536
Why, I remember when that building
was put up in the first place in 1907.

535
00:25:18,632 --> 00:25:19,631
Really?

536
00:25:19,691 --> 00:25:21,173
And those drapes
that are up there?

537
00:25:21,233 --> 00:25:23,016
I didn't have to send
to Chicago for them.

538
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:24,555
I picked them myself
from Petlee's.

539
00:25:24,615 --> 00:25:25,869
In 1907?

540
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:27,751
Let me warn you, Vicky...

541
00:25:27,847 --> 00:25:30,628
hello?
Vicky! Vicky!

542
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,507
Jim Petlee?
Vicky inch.

543
00:25:47,603 --> 00:25:49,557
Well, you can go
back afterwards.

544
00:25:49,617 --> 00:25:52,419
That cotton wrap?
$2.99 a yard, 12.5% discount?

545
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,047
I'll take it.
You can send it out tomorrow.

546
00:26:00,742 --> 00:26:02,600
Dev!

547
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,614
You go back to your seat, dear.

548
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:06,592
I'll join you.

549
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:11,231
Karen, we ought to
put you in the bank

550
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,149
and live off the interest.

551
00:26:13,209 --> 00:26:14,875
You look like a million dollars.

552
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:19,059
Dev, I...I hate to bother you, but
I'm a little upset.

553
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:20,690
Could I talk with
you for a moment?

554
00:26:20,786 --> 00:26:22,896
Why, of course!
Get you anything?

555
00:26:22,991 --> 00:26:24,814
No. I'd like some
fresh air, please.

556
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,732
Absolutely.

557
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:32,198
Where is Stewart tonight?

558
00:26:32,294 --> 00:26:33,445
Isn't he a music lover?

559
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,075
As a matter of fact, he's not.

560
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:36,514
He went back to the clinic.

561
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,240
Oh?

562
00:26:38,336 --> 00:26:41,117
Now, what's fretting
your handsome head?

563
00:26:41,213 --> 00:26:43,167
What can I do?

564
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,104
Dev, how do you get
on with Vicky inch?

565
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,866
Most of the time.
Why?

566
00:26:47,926 --> 00:26:49,785
She was very rude
to me just now.

567
00:26:49,845 --> 00:26:51,415
Is she here?

568
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:52,626
No. On the phone.

569
00:26:52,722 --> 00:26:54,544
Oh! Ha! That's just Vicky.

570
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,826
Don't take it personally.

571
00:26:55,886 --> 00:26:57,746
She made it
unmistakably personal.

572
00:26:57,807 --> 00:26:59,339
Referred to me as a newcomer.

573
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:00,969
She even hung up on me.

574
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:02,216
Only once?

575
00:27:02,312 --> 00:27:04,134
What was it about?

576
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,956
What do you think
of Regina, Dev?

577
00:27:06,052 --> 00:27:08,965
Regina? Oh, very capable woman.

578
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,943
She's been very valuable to us.

579
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,574
Then I don't understand why

580
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,720
Vicky called her a toadstool.

581
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,925
A toadstool?

582
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:18,616
Regina?

583
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:21,397
Ha ha ha!
Vicky's a character!

584
00:27:21,493 --> 00:27:23,315
In what connection, Karen?

585
00:27:23,411 --> 00:27:25,329
Well, I looked in
the library today

586
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:26,959
when I stopped by the clinic...

587
00:27:27,055 --> 00:27:29,585
Today? How did I miss that?

588
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:31,695
Well, I got my first real look
at those curtains.

589
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:32,680
They're a disgrace!

590
00:27:32,741 --> 00:27:34,188
Vicky's doing
something about them.

591
00:27:34,248 --> 00:27:38,372
Vicky spoke as though I had no right
to think about the clinic at all.

592
00:27:38,468 --> 00:27:42,784
She made me feel
suddenly left out, unwanted here.

593
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:46,907
Unwanted? How could
you feel that?

594
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:51,319
I've never given you that feeling,
have I, Karen?

595
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:55,059
Well, you leave Vicky to me.

596
00:27:55,155 --> 00:27:57,013
I'll talk to her in the morning,

597
00:27:57,073 --> 00:27:58,608
give you a ring.

598
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:01,005
Oh, Dev, you're very sweet.

599
00:28:01,101 --> 00:28:05,464
Better yet, why don't we meet
for a late-afternoon drink,

600
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:07,239
put our heads together?

601
00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:09,637
Settle this in no time at all.

602
00:28:17,021 --> 00:28:18,763
- Dr. Mciver?
- Yes, Mrs. Oâ€™Brien?

603
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:20,893
It's Mr. Wictz, doctor.
He's done it again.

604
00:28:20,953 --> 00:28:22,550
Done what?
Had a party, last night.

605
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:24,502
Miss Kubiecki reports
it went on till 2:00.

606
00:28:24,598 --> 00:28:26,089
Several of the
patients complained.

607
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:27,139
To miss Kubiecki?
No.

608
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:28,433
To you? No, among themselves.

609
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,871
Good. Then it's the business
of the patients' committee.

610
00:28:30,932 --> 00:28:32,203
to take it up with Mr. Wictz.

611
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:33,713
That's what the committee's for.

612
00:28:33,774 --> 00:28:35,784
Anything else?
I found out where he keeps it...

613
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,431
in his bureau drawer,
under the socks.

614
00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:38,566
Keeps what?
The whiskey.

615
00:28:38,661 --> 00:28:40,667
- How would you know that?
- I looked.

616
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:42,768
- You mean you searched his room?
- Of course.

617
00:28:42,828 --> 00:28:45,752
Mrs. O'brien, you're a...
Human being and, as such,

618
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:49,007
you feel that you're entitled
to a certain privacy, right?

619
00:28:49,068 --> 00:28:50,167
Yes.

620
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,739
And you'd resent it if
someone violated that privacy.

621
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,764
Yes.

622
00:28:53,861 --> 00:28:56,346
Well, there's some evidence that
Mr. Wictz is human, too.

623
00:28:56,442 --> 00:28:58,775
- Shall I take it away from him?
- Of course not.

624
00:28:58,835 --> 00:29:00,945
But he has somebody
in for a nightcap every night.

625
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:02,225
I've got to do something...

626
00:29:02,286 --> 00:29:03,727
see that he gets clean glasses.

627
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:04,781
But, Dr. Mciv...

628
00:29:04,877 --> 00:29:08,042
Mrs. O'brien, 5 months ago,
Mr. Wictz wanted to cut his throat!

629
00:29:08,138 --> 00:29:10,728
It's much better for him
to want somebody in

630
00:29:10,823 --> 00:29:12,933
for a nightcap, don't you think?

631
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:15,126
Dr. Wolff's been coaxing
him out of his hole.

632
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:17,633
Once he sticks his nose out,
we can't bang down on it.

633
00:29:17,729 --> 00:29:19,874
It isn't consistent.
You understand?

634
00:29:19,934 --> 00:29:21,661
Yes, doctor.

635
00:31:01,113 --> 00:31:02,935
Good morning, Stevie.

636
00:31:06,675 --> 00:31:10,356
It...it wasn't Lois' idea
or Mrs. Jenkins'.

637
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:11,986
It was yours.

638
00:31:12,046 --> 00:31:13,712
Well, what am I supposed to do...

639
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:17,273
get real flattered and be grateful
to you for the rest of my life?

640
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:20,773
You figure this will get me over
my neurotic inertia or something?

641
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:22,500
Get out of here!

642
00:31:22,596 --> 00:31:24,166
You know what I think this is?

643
00:31:24,226 --> 00:31:26,528
I think this is
a neurotic acting-out on me

644
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:29,537
as a surrogate figure
for your son.

645
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,802
Could be...

646
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:33,756
How did you know I had a son?

647
00:31:33,816 --> 00:31:35,387
Well, I didn't.
I meant...

648
00:31:35,447 --> 00:31:36,693
"Son" in general.

649
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:38,264
Oh.

650
00:31:38,324 --> 00:31:39,858
You live alone.

651
00:31:39,954 --> 00:31:41,393
How do you know that?

652
00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:43,730
Well, I've walked by that, uh,

653
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,380
garage place where you live.

654
00:31:46,476 --> 00:31:48,681
You divorced, or what happened?

655
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:52,134
My husband was killed in
a wreck 4 years ago.

656
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,395
So was our son.
I wasn't.

657
00:31:59,998 --> 00:32:02,587
My mother...
Died last year.

658
00:32:02,683 --> 00:32:05,596
That's when I fell apart.

659
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:08,282
Is your father still alive?

660
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:10,260
I don't know.

661
00:32:10,356 --> 00:32:12,178
I don't know where he is.

662
00:32:12,274 --> 00:32:14,575
He ran out on us
when I was a kid.

663
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:17,261
Did you love him very much?

664
00:32:17,357 --> 00:32:19,371
He was a real louse.

665
00:32:21,193 --> 00:32:23,495
Only I...I shouldn't say that.

666
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:24,645
Why not?

667
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:26,372
You're not supposed to.

668
00:32:26,468 --> 00:32:29,537
My mother did
her loving best to ruin me.

669
00:32:29,632 --> 00:32:32,222
I fooled her,
though. Got over it.

670
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:33,792
Withstood it, anyway.

671
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:34,907
How?

672
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:36,825
Got analyzed.

673
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,031
Now, I'm perfect.

674
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:42,100
You mean people...
Get better?

675
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:44,498
It helps, if you work at it.

676
00:32:44,593 --> 00:32:46,703
Now, beat it.
I have to write a memo.

677
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,710
About what?

678
00:32:47,771 --> 00:32:50,504
The price of muslin,
if it's any of your business.

679
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,622
I don't...Usually
ask questions much.

680
00:32:57,061 --> 00:33:00,514
I'm not...Very interested
in anybody but myself.

681
00:33:02,144 --> 00:33:06,112
I don't usually...
Tell people much, either.

682
00:33:06,172 --> 00:33:09,337
You're going to hate yourself
in the morning.

683
00:33:14,611 --> 00:33:16,338
Here.

684
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:18,639
I'm not sure you deserve them.

685
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:38,875
Vicky.

686
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:46,827
Oh. Uh, Dr. Devanal
is on the phone.

687
00:33:46,923 --> 00:33:49,425
I know. Been trying to get through
for the last 20 minutes.

688
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,055
Who is he gabbing with, anyhow?

689
00:33:51,151 --> 00:33:53,261
Mrs. Mciver.

690
00:34:13,592 --> 00:34:15,450
Can you put these on cloth, Abe?

691
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,196
Easy, and silkscreen
them. They look good.

692
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:20,306
Good.
Let's go ahead.

693
00:34:20,402 --> 00:34:21,744
You feel kind of proud, huh?

694
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,410
A little.
You should.

695
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:26,156
This boy's at the point
where he needs people he can trust.

696
00:34:26,252 --> 00:34:27,690
He likes you, you know.

697
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:28,841
I like him.

698
00:34:28,937 --> 00:34:30,699
That's good judgment
on both sides.

699
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:32,390
If we can make
this work, we may be able

700
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:34,152
to show him we're different...

701
00:34:34,212 --> 00:34:36,322
good parents.

702
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,563
Oh, could I use
your phone a minute?

703
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:40,350
Surely.

704
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:54,256
This is Mciver. Will you
get my home, please?

705
00:35:07,394 --> 00:35:08,581
Hello?

706
00:35:08,641 --> 00:35:11,171
Sorry. I was in the shower.

707
00:35:11,231 --> 00:35:13,724
Oh, I...I'm sorry,
dear. No, I can't.

708
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,582
I have a date
for cocktails. Why?

709
00:35:15,642 --> 00:35:17,848
Well, um...
Never mind.

710
00:35:17,944 --> 00:35:20,342
The lake will
be there next week.

711
00:35:20,437 --> 00:35:21,684
Uh...

712
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,670
Look, Karen, it's been a long time
since we've had a chance to talk.

713
00:35:24,765 --> 00:35:26,035
How about tonight?

714
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:28,721
No, I won't.
I'll be home early.

715
00:35:28,781 --> 00:35:30,699
Ok, I'll see you then.

716
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,138
Good-bye.

717
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:05,644
Excuse me.

718
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:07,191
Can you tell me
where to take this?

719
00:36:07,251 --> 00:36:08,490
It's material from Petlee's.

720
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:10,403
Oh, that must be the canvas
for Mr. Irwin.

721
00:36:10,499 --> 00:36:12,322
No, it's cotton rep
for miss inch.

722
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:13,952
Miss inch?
Yeah.

723
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:15,486
Man: Good night, Mrs. Rinehart.

724
00:36:15,582 --> 00:36:17,404
Oh, good night, doctor.

725
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,569
Oh, uh, miss inch's office is just
inside the service entrance.

726
00:36:20,665 --> 00:36:22,200
Thank you.

727
00:36:23,734 --> 00:36:27,283
Man: Stevie! Mrs. Rinehart tells me
your sketches are splendid, splendid!

728
00:36:27,378 --> 00:36:30,119
Oh, they are, Stevie. I saw them.
They're beautiful.

729
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,713
I've never seen her so
enthusiastic about any...

730
00:36:38,695 --> 00:36:40,709
Man: Ah! The Cezanne
of the psychos!

731
00:36:40,805 --> 00:36:43,430
This is your moment!
Make the most of it.

732
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,600
You're on the assembly
line of success.

733
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:46,943
From now on, you'll hover

734
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,801
between exhilaration
and despair.

735
00:36:48,861 --> 00:36:50,587
I pity you.

736
00:36:50,683 --> 00:36:52,505
For a few moments of elation,

737
00:36:52,601 --> 00:36:54,232
a mass of inflamed nerve ends!

738
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:56,665
I don't think you're very
funny Mr. Capp.

739
00:36:56,725 --> 00:36:58,295
I think you ridicule
other people

740
00:36:58,355 --> 00:37:00,657
to hide your own insecurity.

741
00:37:01,904 --> 00:37:03,534
I detest myself.

742
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,674
Appleton: Gibbon captured
it magnificently

743
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:07,763
in his decline and fall
of the Roman empire,

744
00:37:07,824 --> 00:37:09,900
but he missed the
delicious irony to be found

745
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,338
in the pattern of the Caesars.

746
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:13,125
Now, granted,
Caligula was a beast...

747
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:14,791
cruel, cunning, and licentious.

748
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:16,002
Nevertheless, it...

749
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,742
Yes? Come in.

750
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:20,833
I'm not disturbing you?

751
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:23,386
Oh, Mrs. Rinehart.
No. Come in.

752
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:24,669
It's nice to have a visitor.

753
00:37:24,729 --> 00:37:26,263
It gets lonely here
this time of day.

754
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:28,142
I'm not keeping you
from your dinner, am I?

755
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:30,200
No, I was just having a Sherry
before I go in.

756
00:37:30,296 --> 00:37:32,018
Always do.
Have one with me?

757
00:37:32,114 --> 00:37:34,128
Why, thank you.
I'd love one.

758
00:37:34,224 --> 00:37:36,561
You don't eat here
at night, do you?

759
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,620
No.

760
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,402
Where do you eat?

761
00:37:39,498 --> 00:37:41,452
Oh...In town, usually.

762
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:43,370
Mmm, expensive.

763
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,401
Oh, isn't everything these days?

764
00:37:45,462 --> 00:37:49,089
I... I understand your new drapes for
the library are costing a fortune.

765
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:51,234
270 plus.

766
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:53,632
The entire expense
is unnecessary.

767
00:37:53,692 --> 00:37:54,939
It's a crime!

768
00:37:55,035 --> 00:37:56,090
Have you begun on them?

769
00:37:56,186 --> 00:37:57,336
Yes. Why?

770
00:37:57,432 --> 00:37:59,254
Because, if you hadn't,
I think I know

771
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,364
how we can reduce
the crime to a misdemeanor.

772
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,318
But you've already begun.

773
00:38:03,378 --> 00:38:05,009
Sue.

774
00:38:05,872 --> 00:38:07,059
Sue.

775
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,118
You wouldn't...

776
00:38:08,178 --> 00:38:09,504
I mean, um...

777
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,892
Would you like to
go downtown with me

778
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:13,832
to the movies
tonight, to celebrate?

779
00:38:13,928 --> 00:38:15,882
- No!
- Oh!

780
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:17,324
I'll get that for you, my dear.

781
00:38:17,384 --> 00:38:19,878
A little water. That's
very easily mopped up.

782
00:38:28,313 --> 00:38:29,788
Sue: Stevie?

783
00:38:29,848 --> 00:38:31,958
Stevie, wait a minute.

784
00:38:37,424 --> 00:38:39,726
I want to tell you something.

785
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,233
I'm ashamed of it.

786
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:48,166
Oh, I wanted to go.

787
00:38:48,261 --> 00:38:50,851
Nobody ever asked me before...

788
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,550
But I just can't.

789
00:38:59,194 --> 00:39:01,017
Why not?

790
00:39:04,949 --> 00:39:06,771
I'm phobic.

791
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:10,128
I haven't been off grounds
since I came, not once.

792
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:13,196
It's what's wrong with me.

793
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:19,047
What would happen if you did?

794
00:39:19,142 --> 00:39:22,020
I mean, I-like going downtown
to the movies?

795
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,376
Start screaming or something?

796
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,980
Well, they'd think
you were a critic, that's all.

797
00:39:33,528 --> 00:39:35,386
Well...

798
00:39:35,446 --> 00:39:38,227
I'd like to try,
though. I mean, well...

799
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:40,181
Maybe if you went with me
and knew about it,

800
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:43,502
it would be all right...
If you took care of me.

801
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:45,324
All right.
Let's go, then.

802
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,374
Oh, no.
I...I didn't mean now.

803
00:39:47,434 --> 00:39:49,928
I just meant sometime.
Well...

804
00:39:50,024 --> 00:39:52,229
I couldn't go suddenly.

805
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:58,271
Ok.

806
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:00,094
Sometime.

807
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:09,972
The muslin... cartoons?

808
00:40:10,068 --> 00:40:12,177
Well... muslin cartoons?

809
00:40:12,273 --> 00:40:14,575
Mrs. Rinehart, just
what are you up to?

810
00:40:14,671 --> 00:40:16,493
I'm not up to anything,
miss inch.

811
00:40:16,589 --> 00:40:18,464
I... I talked this over
with Dr. Mciver today,

812
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:20,190
and he feels that
from a therapeutic...

813
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,484
so that's why you're here...

814
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,518
so that woman can have her way!

815
00:40:23,878 --> 00:40:25,124
What woman?

816
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,371
You cat's-paw!

817
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,961
Miss inch, I came here
to ask your cooperation.

818
00:40:29,057 --> 00:40:31,070
And I thought you
came here to talk to me.

819
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:32,989
Muslin cartoons, indeed!

820
00:40:33,084 --> 00:40:35,098
I never heard
of such taradiddle in all my life!

821
00:40:35,194 --> 00:40:36,585
I haven't the faintest notion...

822
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:38,107
you tell your
Dr. Mciver you saw me

823
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:39,546
and I said you've gone too far!

824
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:40,949
And tell him to keep his loose,

825
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:43,058
busybody wife's nose
out of my affairs!

826
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,662
Karen: Oh, I'm sorry.

827
00:40:47,758 --> 00:40:50,155
I seem to be coming
to you with all my problems today.

828
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:53,128
Marriage is a funny
business, Karen.

829
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:57,753
You can starve for something
you don't get in it.

830
00:40:57,814 --> 00:41:02,431
Oh, it's a great institution
but, like all institutions,

831
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:06,075
something of the
individual gets lost in it,

832
00:41:06,171 --> 00:41:08,317
so...Either we starve

833
00:41:08,377 --> 00:41:11,002
or we look for it outside.

834
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:13,688
Dev, I...I'm not
complaining. It...

835
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:15,858
It's just that...well,
in the beginning,

836
00:41:15,954 --> 00:41:18,159
when...When we lived in Chicago,

837
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:20,173
there was Stewart's
career, of course,

838
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,763
but it was exciting then.
We...we had a life together.

839
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,196
We seemed to bring
something to each other.

840
00:41:25,256 --> 00:41:26,539
And now?

841
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:28,517
I'm not really selfish, Dev.

842
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:30,375
He wanted to come out
here and I didn't,

843
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:32,964
but I came, and now
gradually it's changed.

844
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:35,230
He's become so absorbed,
so...so unapproachable.

845
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,203
He has work to express
himself in. I don't.

846
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:40,601
I have nothing, and when I do try
to find something

847
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:43,226
to bring me closer to him, he...

848
00:41:43,286 --> 00:41:45,144
I need...

849
00:41:45,204 --> 00:41:47,506
I don't know what I need.

850
00:41:58,247 --> 00:42:00,628
Hello.

851
00:42:01,124 --> 00:42:03,138
Found your message at home.

852
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:04,613
Sounded urgent.

853
00:42:04,673 --> 00:42:06,015
I didn't mean to drag you out.

854
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:08,328
Oh, it's all right.
It's on the way. What's up?

855
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:10,175
I'm afraid I made a
mistake...a bad one.

856
00:42:10,235 --> 00:42:12,564
Some material came from
Petlee's for Vicky inch.

857
00:42:12,625 --> 00:42:15,510
I... I tried to get hold of you
and then I went in to see her.

858
00:42:15,606 --> 00:42:17,428
She took the top of my head off.

859
00:42:17,524 --> 00:42:19,250
- She did?
- Mmm...

860
00:42:19,346 --> 00:42:20,916
Heh heh! Well, I'll talk to her

861
00:42:20,976 --> 00:42:22,163
in the morning.
Forget it.

862
00:42:22,223 --> 00:42:23,806
I think I'd better
brief you a little:

863
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:24,909
I'm a cat's-paw.

864
00:42:25,004 --> 00:42:26,575
You're using me to further some

865
00:42:26,635 --> 00:42:28,877
sinister scheme
of Mrs. Mciver's.

866
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:29,936
Karen?

867
00:42:29,996 --> 00:42:32,085
Mmm. Quote: Tell Dr. Mciver

868
00:42:32,581 --> 00:42:34,499
to keep his wife out
of my affairs. Unquote.

869
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:36,261
More or less, minus adjectives.

870
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,987
Now, what does that mean?

871
00:42:38,047 --> 00:42:41,212
I don't know. She wouldn't discuss
it further, stomped out on me.

872
00:42:41,273 --> 00:42:43,130
Hmm. Maybe I better
call her from here.

873
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:44,761
May I?
Oh, of course.

874
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:47,446
Here...can I help you with that?
No, I can manage.

875
00:42:48,693 --> 00:42:50,227
Oh, I'm sorry.
The bulb's out.

876
00:42:50,323 --> 00:42:51,858
That's all right.

877
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,442
Wonder who put that
bat in her belfry?

878
00:42:55,502 --> 00:42:56,557
Vicky?
Yeah.

879
00:42:56,653 --> 00:42:58,283
Thought I should ask you.

880
00:42:58,379 --> 00:43:00,237
What...you mean you think I am?

881
00:43:00,297 --> 00:43:01,772
Using me?
Yeah.

882
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:03,174
No.

883
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:06,723
Here...I'll help you.

884
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,915
I'm afraid the place
is in a shambles.

885
00:43:14,011 --> 00:43:16,121
No, that's all right.
Don't worry about it.

886
00:43:20,437 --> 00:43:22,451
I'm really a better
housekeeper than this.

887
00:43:22,547 --> 00:43:23,546
Looks fine.

888
00:43:23,606 --> 00:43:24,657
Give me a week.

889
00:43:24,753 --> 00:43:26,898
- Where's the phone?
- Oh, it's on the floor there.

890
00:43:26,958 --> 00:43:28,589
Thank you.

891
00:43:52,661 --> 00:43:55,154
Oh, hello, Vicky. This is Dr. Mciver.
How are you?

892
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:58,511
Good. Uh, look...
I, uh,

893
00:43:58,607 --> 00:44:01,196
I want to unmix this
mix-up about the drapes.

894
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:04,745
No, no, no.
W-wai-wait a minute.

895
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:07,178
Karen called you?

896
00:44:07,238 --> 00:44:09,060
Well, what's Karen got...

897
00:44:09,156 --> 00:44:12,261
well, yes, of course,
I'll ask her, but I still don't know...

898
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:13,855
hello, Vicky?

899
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,965
Vi...

900
00:44:16,061 --> 00:44:18,906
well, there's one thing you can't
take away from Vicky inch...

901
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:20,125
she does have her foibles,

902
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:22,295
and several other people's, too.

903
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:24,789
Oh.

904
00:44:24,884 --> 00:44:27,474
You said something
last night about privacy.

905
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:30,866
Snooping is one of the prerogatives
of all medical men.

906
00:44:30,926 --> 00:44:32,077
But not nurses?

907
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:33,228
Mrs. O'brien?

908
00:44:33,324 --> 00:44:34,379
She's not a nurse.

909
00:44:34,475 --> 00:44:36,489
She's a policewoman in disguise.

910
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,380
She'll learn.

911
00:44:42,435 --> 00:44:45,120
That's a nice-looking
chair. You make it?

912
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:46,183
Yes.

913
00:44:46,279 --> 00:44:48,321
Uh...Think I could trust it?

914
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:49,759
Stronger than you are.

915
00:44:49,819 --> 00:44:52,025
Well, I should hope so. Heh heh.

916
00:44:52,888 --> 00:44:55,190
What about Mr Wictz?

917
00:44:55,286 --> 00:44:58,317
What if his drinking does
annoy the other patients?

918
00:44:58,378 --> 00:45:01,232
Simple. Let the patient
committee call him on it.

919
00:45:01,328 --> 00:45:02,707
Well, can he take it?

920
00:45:02,767 --> 00:45:04,912
The patients?
Sure.

921
00:45:04,972 --> 00:45:07,885
Well, he better.
He can't keep people up all night.

922
00:45:07,945 --> 00:45:09,768
He's not Scheherazade.

923
00:45:09,863 --> 00:45:11,973
Oh.

924
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:14,179
One thing I've learned
since I've been here...

925
00:45:14,275 --> 00:45:16,289
a sense of humor's
indispensable.

926
00:45:16,385 --> 00:45:17,632
Ah, it sure is.

927
00:45:17,728 --> 00:45:21,851
You're in on so much suffering, so much
goes wrong all day, you begin to fray.

928
00:45:21,947 --> 00:45:23,997
Then you don't have
anything left to give them.

929
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,244
And they need so much more.

930
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:27,354
Sure, they're starving.

931
00:45:27,414 --> 00:45:29,428
Here.

932
00:45:31,154 --> 00:45:32,976
Now, that's a good-looking case.

933
00:45:33,072 --> 00:45:34,223
You make that, too?

934
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,141
No. My husband.

935
00:45:36,237 --> 00:45:37,771
Oh, I'm sorry.

936
00:45:38,826 --> 00:45:41,224
But, in a...
Kind of magic way,

937
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,293
somebody always comes up
with something.

938
00:45:44,389 --> 00:45:46,211
Like these, uh...

939
00:45:46,307 --> 00:45:48,129
Like these drapes of yours.

940
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:49,604
I haven't seen Stevie so eager

941
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,965
about anything
since he got here.

942
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:53,787
I owe you something.

943
00:45:53,883 --> 00:45:55,130
That was sue's idea.

944
00:45:55,226 --> 00:45:56,952
Mm-hmm.
I just made it contagious.

945
00:45:57,048 --> 00:45:59,350
I thought it was
very skillfully handled.

946
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:01,687
I thought so myself,
until I was under your eye.

947
00:46:01,747 --> 00:46:03,666
Then I got uncomfortable.

948
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,584
Tell me...how would you
have done it?

949
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,300
Well, I don't know.
There aren't any rules.

950
00:46:08,361 --> 00:46:11,338
If your heart's in the
right place and your brain,

951
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:13,256
you just trust
what comes to you.

952
00:46:13,352 --> 00:46:15,977
You think mine is?
Are?

953
00:46:16,037 --> 00:46:17,188
Heh heh heh!
You work here

954
00:46:17,284 --> 00:46:18,818
a few months more,
I'll let you know.

955
00:46:18,914 --> 00:46:19,993
Oh.

956
00:46:20,053 --> 00:46:21,923
Hey, you're right.
This thing is comfortable.

957
00:46:21,983 --> 00:46:23,326
Certainly, it's comfortable.

958
00:46:23,422 --> 00:46:26,107
So why don't I just
sit here instead?

959
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:27,402
Instead of what?

960
00:46:27,463 --> 00:46:31,058
Instead of going out into the
night to do battle with Vicky inch.

961
00:46:32,533 --> 00:46:35,314
Yes, sir. This is going to be
a friendly place.

962
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,424
Mmm, in another week or two.

963
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,665
It's friendly now.

964
00:46:39,725 --> 00:46:41,068
Throw me out.

965
00:46:41,164 --> 00:46:42,603
All right. Get out.

966
00:46:42,698 --> 00:46:43,945
Thank you.

967
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:45,096
Let me know who wins.

968
00:46:45,192 --> 00:46:47,338
Yeah, sure. I will.
Good night.

969
00:46:47,398 --> 00:46:48,740
Good night.

970
00:47:31,801 --> 00:47:32,892
Who's there?

971
00:47:32,952 --> 00:47:34,618
It's Dr. Mciver.

972
00:47:34,678 --> 00:47:35,769
What do you want?

973
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:38,323
I want to talk to you. Open up.

974
00:47:40,145 --> 00:47:42,617
I've retired!
I'll talk to you in the morning!

975
00:47:42,678 --> 00:47:45,036
Vicky, this is forcible entry.
Open the door.

976
00:47:45,132 --> 00:47:47,530
Wait a minute.

977
00:47:57,312 --> 00:47:58,778
Dr. Mciver, I must
ask you to go.

978
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:00,704
I hope you realize
you're breaking the law.

979
00:48:00,764 --> 00:48:03,490
This house and the ground
it stands on is my property.

980
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:05,979
I've asked you to leave
and you're trespassing...

981
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,712
Vicky,
stop drooling and sit down.

982
00:48:07,773 --> 00:48:08,729
Sit down!

983
00:48:10,163 --> 00:48:11,985
And shut up!

984
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,054
Now, first of all,
don't ever hang up on me

985
00:48:15,150 --> 00:48:16,493
like that again, Vicky.

986
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:18,689
And if you do, I'll pull your
dress over your head

987
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,081
and beat some manners into you.

988
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:21,415
You wouldn't dare!

989
00:48:21,576 --> 00:48:23,302
Dare me.

990
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:28,001
What's that for?

991
00:48:28,097 --> 00:48:29,427
Dr. Mciver, I have neighbors.

992
00:48:29,523 --> 00:48:31,649
What will they think,
with me not properly dressed?

993
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:32,944
You're dressed, all right.

994
00:48:33,004 --> 00:48:34,138
I am not.

995
00:48:34,235 --> 00:48:36,632
Then you want your neighbors
to see that you're not?

996
00:48:38,071 --> 00:48:39,066
Dr. Mciver!

997
00:48:39,126 --> 00:48:40,281
I'd like an ashtray, Vicky.

998
00:48:40,377 --> 00:48:41,340
I don't smoke!

999
00:48:41,536 --> 00:48:45,168
Then get me a saucer,
or don't you eat?

1000
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,333
Thank you.

1001
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:50,730
Now, just what...
sit down, sit down.

1002
00:48:50,826 --> 00:48:52,936
Just what is all this
nonsense about Karen?

1003
00:48:53,032 --> 00:48:54,471
I find it very peculiar...

1004
00:48:54,566 --> 00:48:56,485
I don't care what you find it!

1005
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,534
And incidentally,
this act of yours...

1006
00:48:58,594 --> 00:49:00,225
going around,
frightening people...

1007
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:01,891
I've seen it tried too often.

1008
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:05,212
I know it frightens you more
than anybody else, so cut it out.

1009
00:49:05,308 --> 00:49:07,130
Our job running the clinic
is tough enough

1010
00:49:07,226 --> 00:49:09,755
without fancy dramatics.

1011
00:49:09,815 --> 00:49:11,194
Now, when did Karen call you?

1012
00:49:11,254 --> 00:49:13,172
Last night.
What about?

1013
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:15,509
Swatches!

1014
00:49:15,569 --> 00:49:17,104
What I'm to do,
what she's to do,

1015
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,420
what Regina Mitchell-Smythe is going
to do about drapes for the library!

1016
00:49:21,516 --> 00:49:23,530
I see.

1017
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:24,776
Well, I'm, uh,

1018
00:49:24,872 --> 00:49:27,366
I'm sorry this got
so tangled up, Vicky,

1019
00:49:27,462 --> 00:49:29,571
but the decision on
Mrs. Rinehart's project

1020
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:31,969
is one of therapeutic
policy. It stands.

1021
00:49:32,065 --> 00:49:34,271
The patients make the drapes.

1022
00:49:35,805 --> 00:49:37,148
They'll be very peculiar.

1023
00:49:37,244 --> 00:49:40,505
It's a matter of taste, on which
you are in no way the final arbiter.

1024
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,231
Who's to explain
to the trustees?

1025
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:44,628
I'm running the clinic,
Vicky, not the trustees.

1026
00:49:44,724 --> 00:49:45,911
I was under the impression

1027
00:49:45,971 --> 00:49:48,465
that Dr. Devanal is
running the clinic!

1028
00:49:50,479 --> 00:49:53,104
Didn't you ever
read my contract?

1029
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:54,123
No.

1030
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:56,460
How'd you miss that?

1031
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,206
Dev keeps it locked in his desk.

1032
00:49:59,302 --> 00:50:00,548
Oh.

1033
00:50:00,644 --> 00:50:03,476
Well, Mrs. Rinehart will
be ordering a few things,

1034
00:50:03,537 --> 00:50:05,919
so whatever she needs,
you take care of it.

1035
00:50:06,015 --> 00:50:07,454
Uh...

1036
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:09,276
This your father?

1037
00:50:09,372 --> 00:50:10,558
Yes.

1038
00:50:10,618 --> 00:50:12,536
Formidable gent.

1039
00:50:12,632 --> 00:50:15,318
He fought the Indians to
settle this territory.

1040
00:50:16,277 --> 00:50:18,099
Oh.

1041
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:19,390
Well, good night, Vicky.

1042
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,956
Uh, would you...

1043
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:24,524
Could I get you
a cup of tea or something?

1044
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,579
No, thanks, Vicky.

1045
00:50:25,675 --> 00:50:27,402
Dr. Mciver!

1046
00:50:27,497 --> 00:50:29,895
I...Do you think we could...

1047
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:32,484
Get along better together?

1048
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,575
Why, sure, Vicky.

1049
00:50:33,635 --> 00:50:35,493
My terms are simple...

1050
00:50:35,553 --> 00:50:37,891
unconditional surrender.

1051
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,869
Good night.

1052
00:50:57,995 --> 00:50:59,625
Well!

1053
00:51:02,119 --> 00:51:03,114
Karen?

1054
00:51:03,174 --> 00:51:04,325
Mom? Come on and watch me

1055
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:06,087
beat the tar out
of your husband.

1056
00:51:06,147 --> 00:51:08,257
I think I'll go up, mark.
Good night.

1057
00:51:08,353 --> 00:51:09,887
Karen,

1058
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,230
I thought we had a date.

1059
00:51:11,326 --> 00:51:13,915
I got stuck at the office.

1060
00:51:29,164 --> 00:51:31,022
I've been waiting
3 hours, Karen.

1061
00:51:31,082 --> 00:51:32,329
I'd like to talk to you.

1062
00:51:32,424 --> 00:51:34,918
I'd rather not now.
I have a bad headache.

1063
00:51:35,014 --> 00:51:36,836
Well, then, what were you
drinking for?

1064
00:51:36,932 --> 00:51:38,982
You know alcohol
dilates the capillaries.

1065
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:42,243
Oh, go write a book
if you know so much.

1066
00:51:42,303 --> 00:51:45,467
Well, there's one thing
I didn't know so much about!

1067
00:51:52,085 --> 00:51:53,427
Karen.

1068
00:51:53,523 --> 00:51:55,825
What are you quarreling
with me about?

1069
00:51:55,921 --> 00:51:57,587
What?

1070
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:00,333
I said what are you
quarreling with...

1071
00:52:01,483 --> 00:52:03,210
what are you quarreling
with me about?

1072
00:52:03,306 --> 00:52:05,415
I'm not quarreling!

1073
00:52:20,856 --> 00:52:23,062
Why didn't you tell me
about these drapes of yours?

1074
00:52:23,158 --> 00:52:25,124
Seems odd I have to hear
about it from other...

1075
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:26,135
when?

1076
00:52:26,231 --> 00:52:27,230
What?

1077
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,529
When should I have told you?

1078
00:52:28,624 --> 00:52:30,386
Well, anytime.
What do you mean "when"?

1079
00:52:30,446 --> 00:52:33,264
Last night at the concert,
perhaps, during the intermission?

1080
00:52:33,324 --> 00:52:34,606
Oh, Karen.

1081
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:36,584
I tried to. When are you
ever in long enough?

1082
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,215
I even telephoned this evening.

1083
00:52:38,311 --> 00:52:39,653
Sadie said you weren't home.

1084
00:52:39,714 --> 00:52:40,900
I thought we had a date!

1085
00:52:40,996 --> 00:52:43,681
I was at Vicky's, trying
to straighten out this tangle!

1086
00:52:43,777 --> 00:52:46,283
Before you know it, we'll have
so many drapes around here,

1087
00:52:46,344 --> 00:52:47,745
we can wrap the
clinic up in them.

1088
00:52:47,805 --> 00:52:50,107
I straightened it out with Dev.

1089
00:52:52,408 --> 00:52:53,943
Dev?

1090
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:55,705
Is that who you had dinner with?

1091
00:52:55,765 --> 00:52:57,048
Yes. Isn't that allowed?

1092
00:52:57,108 --> 00:52:59,314
Karen, you didn't go
to Dev to sweet-talk him

1093
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:01,459
into these drapes, too, did you?

1094
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:03,246
Did you talk about them?

1095
00:53:03,341 --> 00:53:04,972
Among other things.

1096
00:53:05,068 --> 00:53:06,698
Listen, I want
to tell you something.

1097
00:53:06,794 --> 00:53:09,383
Don't you ever again
go over my head to Dev

1098
00:53:09,479 --> 00:53:11,114
about anything to do
with this clinic!

1099
00:53:11,210 --> 00:53:12,680
Do you understand?

1100
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,215
Meg Rinehart has a project on

1101
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,480
for the patients to make
drapes of their own.

1102
00:53:16,576 --> 00:53:19,525
It's going to be tough enough without
any additional monkey business,

1103
00:53:19,586 --> 00:53:20,508
least of all with Dev.

1104
00:53:20,604 --> 00:53:21,796
Has it never occurred to you

1105
00:53:21,857 --> 00:53:24,344
that I might be interested in
talking to Dev with no purpose

1106
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,167
except to talk with
another human being?

1107
00:53:26,263 --> 00:53:27,209
Ha ha!

1108
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:29,427
We discussed a great
deal besides the clinic.

1109
00:53:29,523 --> 00:53:31,102
Yes, you must have.
What else did you

1110
00:53:31,162 --> 00:53:32,628
talk to him about for 4 hours?

1111
00:53:32,688 --> 00:53:35,661
As a matter of fact,
I talked about you.

1112
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:38,059
Oh, I see.

1113
00:53:38,155 --> 00:53:41,415
You've been encouraging Dev
by weeping on his shoulder.

1114
00:53:41,511 --> 00:53:42,466
I don't weep.

1115
00:53:42,562 --> 00:53:45,260
You don't know what's going on
inside that man. Leave him alone.

1116
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:46,886
Huh! Don't I?
When did you last have

1117
00:53:46,982 --> 00:53:48,512
a heart-to-heart talk with Dev?

1118
00:53:48,608 --> 00:53:50,334
Is that what you think you had?

1119
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:53,007
I hate to break into your
little dream, Karen,

1120
00:53:53,068 --> 00:53:56,280
but you're not exactly a unique
event in Dr. Devanal's life.

1121
00:53:56,376 --> 00:53:58,390
It happens with
every woman he meets,

1122
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:00,308
including his secretary and...

1123
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,898
will you stop knowing everything
about everything?!

1124
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,226
Rosie's asleep.

1125
00:54:06,822 --> 00:54:08,779
Don't turn into an
attentive father suddenly.

1126
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,373
Now, what does that mean...that
I'm neglecting the kids, too?

1127
00:54:11,433 --> 00:54:13,189
Yes, the only ones
who get anything real

1128
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,697
from you are those professional
children out at the clinic.

1129
00:54:15,757 --> 00:54:17,387
Yesterday in school,
they asked Rosie

1130
00:54:17,483 --> 00:54:19,122
what she wanted to be
when she grew up.

1131
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:20,964
Would you like to know
what she answered?

1132
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:23,038
A patient!

1133
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,640
People...

1134
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,906
Fight sometimes, mark.

1135
00:55:17,319 --> 00:55:20,868
Good night.

1136
00:55:43,693 --> 00:55:46,606
As it happens, when this "monkey
business"... as you call it...

1137
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:48,872
about the drapes first
occurred to me yesterday,

1138
00:55:48,968 --> 00:55:50,982
I stopped by your
office to tell you.

1139
00:55:51,078 --> 00:55:52,552
I tried to tell you last night.

1140
00:55:52,612 --> 00:55:54,051
I thought you'd be pleased.

1141
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:55,489
Now I'm sick of the whole thing.

1142
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:57,695
I don't care
if they never go up!

1143
00:55:58,846 --> 00:56:01,567
I'd be home more, Karen...

1144
00:56:01,627 --> 00:56:04,504
If there were more
to come home to.

1145
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,326
What, for instance?

1146
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:09,012
A real woman.

1147
00:56:09,108 --> 00:56:11,030
You don't make me
feel like a woman.

1148
00:56:11,091 --> 00:56:14,095
What do you think I've been
trying to tell you for months?

1149
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,720
I am a woman. I want
to be one, but I...

1150
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:19,501
I have to feel I...
I'm desired!

1151
00:56:19,561 --> 00:56:22,378
Everyone thinks
you're desirable.

1152
00:56:22,438 --> 00:56:24,260
Do you?

1153
00:56:24,356 --> 00:56:25,891
Do you?!

1154
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:44,052
No, you think you're
going to win this game,

1155
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:45,875
but you're not!
Hooray!

1156
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:46,894
Ha ha ha!

1157
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,216
Hooray!

1158
00:56:48,612 --> 00:56:50,059
Has he or has he not
the authority

1159
00:56:50,154 --> 00:56:51,918
to let the patients make
their own drapes?

1160
00:56:52,013 --> 00:56:52,964
The patients do what?

1161
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,603
Library drapes,
from start to finish.

1162
00:56:54,699 --> 00:56:57,703
Well, that's... didn't you know?
Don't you have to ok things like this?

1163
00:56:57,764 --> 00:56:58,763
Well, uh...

1164
00:56:58,823 --> 00:57:00,409
Aren't you administrative
head anymore?

1165
00:57:00,469 --> 00:57:01,420
What?

1166
00:57:01,516 --> 00:57:04,114
- Why haven't I seen Mciver's contract?
- You never asked me.

1167
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:05,180
I'm asking you now!

1168
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,704
Vicky, I'd only be too glad to
have you look at this thing.

1169
00:57:07,765 --> 00:57:09,365
It's in the bottom
right-hand drawer.

1170
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:10,372
No, it's not!

1171
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,834
Unlock it, and let's
have a look!

1172
00:57:11,894 --> 00:57:14,411
We'll have to continue this another time.
I have a patient.

1173
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,844
Oh, uh, Cobby, send Mr. Capp in...
The minute he arrives.

1174
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,894
Now, just a minute.
I want to dictate a letter.

1175
00:57:18,954 --> 00:57:19,928
I'll get my book.

1176
00:57:19,989 --> 00:57:22,158
No, no, nevermind.
Here. Use this.

1177
00:57:22,954 --> 00:57:25,927
Now, Vicky, you'll have to
excuse me.

1178
00:57:29,955 --> 00:57:31,393
Get out.

1179
00:57:31,873 --> 00:57:32,832
Pardon?

1180
00:57:32,928 --> 00:57:34,366
Inch: I said, "get out!"

1181
00:57:35,709 --> 00:57:37,051
All right.

1182
00:57:43,381 --> 00:57:44,760
Now, look here, Vicky!

1183
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,870
I'm good and sick
of your high-hand!

1184
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,135
What do you think you are
around here, the queen bee?

1185
00:57:49,231 --> 00:57:50,706
You're just another employee.

1186
00:57:50,766 --> 00:57:52,492
Then fire me!

1187
00:57:56,808 --> 00:57:58,918
Well, am I fired?

1188
00:58:00,164 --> 00:58:01,543
Of course you're not fired.

1189
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,173
Don't be ridiculous.

1190
00:58:03,233 --> 00:58:04,480
Because you can't.

1191
00:58:04,576 --> 00:58:07,357
You gave that up,
too, didn't you?

1192
00:58:07,453 --> 00:58:08,796
Didn't you?

1193
00:58:08,892 --> 00:58:10,530
That's why you didn't want me
to read

1194
00:58:10,626 --> 00:58:11,960
Mciver's contract, isn't it?

1195
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:13,591
Isn't it?

1196
00:58:22,702 --> 00:58:24,524
Why didn't you tell me?

1197
00:58:26,154 --> 00:58:28,648
I haven't even told Edna.

1198
00:58:28,744 --> 00:58:31,141
I have some pride left, Vicky.

1199
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,306
You let me fight your battles,

1200
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,608
when you knew I could
be fired for it.

1201
00:58:36,704 --> 00:58:39,869
Now, look here, Vicky.

1202
00:58:39,965 --> 00:58:42,938
We've been working
together for 20 years.

1203
00:58:43,033 --> 00:58:46,198
Friends are supposed
to be able to lean on each other.

1204
00:58:46,294 --> 00:58:49,363
A man should stand
on his own two feet.

1205
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:52,240
I've been standing on mine
for 48 years.

1206
00:58:55,117 --> 00:58:59,948
It's time someone around here began
holding me up once in a while.

1207
00:59:00,008 --> 00:59:01,962
You think Mciver will?

1208
00:59:02,022 --> 00:59:05,211
Just last night,
his own wife was standing...

1209
00:59:05,272 --> 00:59:10,330
I remember Sanford Collins in here.
It was always a beautiful, big room.

1210
00:59:11,421 --> 00:59:13,435
It's a sad sight.

1211
00:59:14,682 --> 00:59:15,964
What is?

1212
00:59:16,024 --> 00:59:19,189
Seeing such a small man in it.

1213
00:59:35,109 --> 00:59:37,063
Oh, Mr. Capp...

1214
00:59:37,123 --> 00:59:39,521
Do you mind waiting
for me a few minutes?

1215
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:40,959
Thank you.
Cobby...

1216
00:59:42,014 --> 00:59:43,777
Uh, what's my schedule
this afternoon?

1217
00:59:43,837 --> 00:59:46,558
Never mind. Clear me up
for the rest of the day.

1218
00:59:46,618 --> 00:59:49,015
I can't work anymore.
I'm due out.

1219
01:00:21,143 --> 01:00:23,349
Petlee? Inch.

1220
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:26,418
Fine. Jim, this cotton rep...

1221
01:00:26,514 --> 01:00:28,180
I find it's not satis...

1222
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,830
you better have Albert
come and take it back.

1223
01:01:00,464 --> 01:01:03,533
Uh, Cobby, take a memo
for me, please.

1224
01:01:08,424 --> 01:01:11,013
From the office of
the medical director...

1225
01:01:11,972 --> 01:01:14,466
To general distribution.

1226
01:01:14,562 --> 01:01:17,343
Subject: Library drapes.

1227
01:01:19,357 --> 01:01:21,083
It is my decision,

1228
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:25,495
based on careful examination
of the elements involved,

1229
01:01:25,591 --> 01:01:27,832
and taking into consideration
the expressed wishes

1230
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:30,098
of the chairman of
the board of trustees...

1231
01:01:31,345 --> 01:01:32,592
Sadie!

1232
01:01:35,948 --> 01:01:37,135
Mciver?

1233
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:38,190
Yes.

1234
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,360
Air express for
Mrs. Stewart Mciver.

1235
01:01:46,114 --> 01:01:47,936
You're welcome.

1236
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,363
Sadie!

1237
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:07,213
I'm not too early?

1238
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:08,843
It's all right, Sadie.

1239
01:02:08,939 --> 01:02:10,474
Come in here.

1240
01:02:11,529 --> 01:02:13,926
We did have a date
for lunch, didn't we?

1241
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:15,844
Did we? I don't remember.

1242
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,798
Oh! Karen, I'm sorry.

1243
01:02:17,858 --> 01:02:21,119
Well, as long as I'm here, why don't
we drive out to the lake for lunch?

1244
01:02:21,215 --> 01:02:24,128
I can't, Dev. I'm not dressed.
I have... take your time, Princess,

1245
01:02:24,188 --> 01:02:26,238
there is nothing
I can't cancel this afternoon.

1246
01:02:26,298 --> 01:02:28,827
Oh, Dev, would you
care for a drink?

1247
01:02:28,887 --> 01:02:30,710
Sure, I'd love one.

1248
01:02:41,355 --> 01:02:44,040
I loved last night, Karen.

1249
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:49,890
You know...After you left, I got to
thinking about something you said.

1250
01:02:51,329 --> 01:02:53,151
How we all go around...

1251
01:02:53,247 --> 01:02:56,544
Each of us shut up
inside himself.

1252
01:02:56,604 --> 01:02:58,330
Oh, it's nobody's fault.

1253
01:02:58,426 --> 01:03:00,859
It's just the way it goes.

1254
01:03:00,919 --> 01:03:05,331
Here we are...Both...
Searching for something,

1255
01:03:06,002 --> 01:03:07,728
hoping for something.

1256
01:03:09,742 --> 01:03:11,085
Well...

1257
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:13,675
I thought...

1258
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:15,245
What did you think, Dev?

1259
01:03:15,305 --> 01:03:17,264
That just because of a
few drinks and a steak

1260
01:03:17,325 --> 01:03:19,389
and your help with those
ridiculous drapes that...

1261
01:03:19,449 --> 01:03:20,571
Karen!

1262
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:23,457
You make it sound so...so sordid.

1263
01:03:24,416 --> 01:03:25,950
Isn't it?

1264
01:03:27,581 --> 01:03:31,417
Well...Last night,
it seemed to me that we...

1265
01:03:32,951 --> 01:03:34,965
I really thought we...

1266
01:03:36,883 --> 01:03:38,418
What happened, Karen?

1267
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,199
What happened with everybody?

1268
01:03:41,295 --> 01:03:43,501
Mark and Rosie will be home
from school any minute.

1269
01:03:43,597 --> 01:03:45,611
I wish you'd leave.

1270
01:03:52,612 --> 01:03:54,146
Dev, I...

1271
01:03:54,242 --> 01:03:59,037
I'm sorry. I...
I know I led you into this.

1272
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:04,216
Wipe your face, Dev.

1273
01:04:22,438 --> 01:04:24,164
Got a cigarette?

1274
01:04:25,315 --> 01:04:26,945
May I visit, or am I rupturing

1275
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:29,151
the delicate bud of creation?

1276
01:04:30,973 --> 01:04:33,023
Is that Genesis or synthesis?

1277
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:34,749
It isn't finished.

1278
01:04:34,809 --> 01:04:37,147
You can see the others
in the barn.

1279
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,585
Ah, incompleteness.

1280
01:04:38,645 --> 01:04:40,504
That's the only
triumph worthwhile.

1281
01:04:40,564 --> 01:04:44,406
With a finished work, you subject
yourself to public scrutiny, praise,

1282
01:04:44,467 --> 01:04:48,140
ridicule, and all the other vulgarities
that go with accomplishment.

1283
01:04:48,236 --> 01:04:49,962
That's why I congratulate you.

1284
01:04:50,058 --> 01:04:53,031
You've just been relieved
of a major responsibility.

1285
01:04:53,127 --> 01:04:55,141
Once again, talent is rejected.

1286
01:04:55,237 --> 01:04:56,859
The itsy-bitsiest triumph,

1287
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,224
with that memo from Dr. Devanal
canceling your drapes.

1288
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:04,156
What?

1289
01:05:04,252 --> 01:05:05,690
Didn't you know?

1290
01:05:05,786 --> 01:05:06,937
Where is it?

1291
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:08,580
Holcomb's got it
in the barber shop.

1292
01:05:08,676 --> 01:05:10,786
I'm sorry, I thought everybody...

1293
01:05:17,391 --> 01:05:18,421
where's that memo?

1294
01:05:18,517 --> 01:05:20,597
Stevie, please,
don't be worried about that memo.

1295
01:05:20,658 --> 01:05:22,094
Everything's going
to be all right.

1296
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:23,111
Gentlemen, please!

1297
01:05:23,172 --> 01:05:24,236
You can't have that!

1298
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:25,770
Please, Stevie!
You must read...

1299
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:28,995
"I waited for her,
and when I went to her..."

1300
01:05:29,091 --> 01:05:30,530
man: Stevie!

1301
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:56,615
Stevie!

1302
01:05:56,711 --> 01:05:58,054
I'm taking my drawings.

1303
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:59,972
They're not your drawings.

1304
01:06:00,643 --> 01:06:02,178
They belong to us.

1305
01:06:02,274 --> 01:06:04,767
Are you the only
one who has put any love into this?

1306
01:06:06,685 --> 01:06:10,809
Get out of the way!

1307
01:06:12,152 --> 01:06:14,933
I'd like to use your
office a minute, Mrs. Rinehart.

1308
01:06:16,947 --> 01:06:18,673
Come on, Stevie.

1309
01:06:48,787 --> 01:06:50,993
It's the first
I've heard of this.

1310
01:06:54,925 --> 01:06:56,747
But you don't want
an explanation.

1311
01:06:56,843 --> 01:06:58,953
You want to believe the worst.

1312
01:07:04,228 --> 01:07:06,434
Dr. Devanal there, miss Cobb?

1313
01:07:06,529 --> 01:07:08,543
Well, where is he?
I want to talk to him.

1314
01:07:09,502 --> 01:07:11,516
Any place you think he might be?

1315
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:14,969
Yes, yes, there is a message,
and take it down,

1316
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:17,367
I want him to get this verbatim.

1317
01:07:17,462 --> 01:07:20,915
Dear Dev, I think there's
a misunderstanding

1318
01:07:21,011 --> 01:07:22,833
on the subject of these drapes.

1319
01:07:22,929 --> 01:07:25,518
There's more at stake here
than the wishes

1320
01:07:25,614 --> 01:07:27,534
of the chairman of
the board of trustees.

1321
01:07:27,595 --> 01:07:29,774
Meanwhile, the patient's
committee will go ahead

1322
01:07:29,834 --> 01:07:32,017
with the drapes which
it already has in work.

1323
01:07:32,078 --> 01:07:34,498
Mciver. And have him call
me soon as he gets back.

1324
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:37,315
Big man.

1325
01:07:37,411 --> 01:07:39,233
Not so big.

1326
01:07:43,548 --> 01:07:46,521
Are you going to send me away to
a closed hospital?

1327
01:07:46,617 --> 01:07:48,667
Depends entirely on you.

1328
01:07:48,727 --> 01:07:51,353
Start knocking people down,
we can't keep you here.

1329
01:07:51,413 --> 01:07:53,426
Is that what you're working for?

1330
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:56,879
Oh, what's the difference?

1331
01:07:56,975 --> 01:07:59,468
I'm just so tired of being sick.

1332
01:08:00,715 --> 01:08:03,305
An hour ago I...
Don't laugh...

1333
01:08:03,401 --> 01:08:06,405
I thought I was well
enough to get out of here.

1334
01:08:06,466 --> 01:08:09,347
It's like trying to get
out of a greased well.

1335
01:08:09,442 --> 01:08:12,511
Not quite. Remember how you were
when you first got here?

1336
01:08:17,211 --> 01:08:19,896
That was closer to bottom.

1337
01:08:19,992 --> 01:08:22,006
What do you think?

1338
01:08:22,869 --> 01:08:24,595
I don't know.

1339
01:08:26,417 --> 01:08:27,892
You can't help me.

1340
01:08:27,952 --> 01:08:29,966
You may be right, you may not.

1341
01:08:30,062 --> 01:08:33,263
But when something like this happens,
if you can't hang on for 5 minutes,

1342
01:08:33,323 --> 01:08:34,893
you're never going to find out.

1343
01:08:34,953 --> 01:08:36,871
I'm free at 2:00, ok?

1344
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:39,976
Let's get going on these drapes

1345
01:08:40,036 --> 01:08:41,318
before someone else horns in.

1346
01:08:41,378 --> 01:08:42,817
I'll talk to Devanal.

1347
01:08:42,913 --> 01:08:44,160
Abe's coming over tonight.

1348
01:08:44,256 --> 01:08:45,934
He's going to test it
on the silkscreen.

1349
01:08:45,994 --> 01:08:47,433
Good. Let me know.

1350
01:09:14,082 --> 01:09:17,151
Mr. Holcomb...
I'm sorry.

1351
01:09:40,455 --> 01:09:41,642
Stevie?

1352
01:09:41,702 --> 01:09:43,141
I made it myself.

1353
01:09:43,237 --> 01:09:45,249
Uh, Stevie,
I was thinking about what you said,

1354
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:47,052
I mean, about going
to the movies in town,

1355
01:09:47,113 --> 01:09:49,374
and I think I could now if
you still wanted to take me.

1356
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:51,388
Well, you don't
have to say anything right now.

1357
01:09:51,484 --> 01:09:53,402
You can think about it.

1358
01:10:19,009 --> 01:10:20,831
Oh, I'm glad you came, Cobby.

1359
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:24,763
Cobby, my dear... But first,
I'm going to get you a little drink.

1360
01:10:24,859 --> 01:10:25,781
I don't want a drink.

1361
01:10:26,277 --> 01:10:27,772
Listen, I shouldn't
have come here.

1362
01:10:27,832 --> 01:10:30,457
Why, if anybody saw me here...
of course, you want a drink.

1363
01:10:30,517 --> 01:10:32,471
Wake you up.

1364
01:10:32,531 --> 01:10:35,025
Get the memo out all right?

1365
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:36,559
Good!

1366
01:10:37,422 --> 01:10:39,532
We're going to fight, Cobby.

1367
01:10:39,628 --> 01:10:42,889
Know that? We've got
our backs to the wall.

1368
01:10:42,985 --> 01:10:44,267
You have, maybe, but I don't.

1369
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:45,991
Do you really want me to
work, or not?

1370
01:10:46,052 --> 01:10:47,440
You said you had
some work to do.

1371
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:49,126
What if somebody
saw me come out here?

1372
01:10:49,219 --> 01:10:52,707
Cobby, you're all I've got left.
You know that.

1373
01:10:52,767 --> 01:10:55,069
All I've got left.
You're important to me.

1374
01:10:55,165 --> 01:10:57,940
Sure...to answer the phone
when Mrs. Mciver calls.

1375
01:10:58,001 --> 01:10:59,900
Listen,
everybody's been calling me

1376
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,434
wanting to know where you are.

1377
01:11:01,494 --> 01:11:03,394
How much longer can
you hide out here?

1378
01:11:03,455 --> 01:11:04,563
Who is hiding? Heh heh!

1379
01:11:04,659 --> 01:11:06,961
Still got a drink or two
up my sleeve. Heh.

1380
01:11:08,112 --> 01:11:10,989
What I said 4 years ago
to Regina...

1381
01:11:11,085 --> 01:11:14,345
I... I... I said,
"all right, Regina.

1382
01:11:14,441 --> 01:11:17,702
Bring in this Mciver whoever-he-is
if you want to."

1383
01:11:19,524 --> 01:11:23,169
"I am perfectly willing
to take a back seat for a while."

1384
01:11:23,264 --> 01:11:24,415
The phone's ringing.

1385
01:11:24,511 --> 01:11:26,237
Do you want me to answer it,
or what?

1386
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:29,306
Huh? Oh!
But of course.

1387
01:11:30,553 --> 01:11:34,485
Hello.
Hello, Regina. Dev.

1388
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:37,206
Regina, there's
an emergency here.

1389
01:11:37,266 --> 01:11:40,527
I want you to fly down tomorrow
before the others.

1390
01:11:40,623 --> 01:11:41,678
It's important.

1391
01:11:41,774 --> 01:11:46,090
Yes...what?
Oh, just a moment.

1392
01:11:58,557 --> 01:12:00,319
Now then, operator.

1393
01:12:00,379 --> 01:12:03,964
What...she's not?
Why not?

1394
01:12:04,024 --> 01:12:07,380
Well...
Keep trying, operator.

1395
01:12:08,915 --> 01:12:11,540
Cobby, get me
Vicky on the phone.

1396
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,230
I want to talk to Vicky.

1397
01:12:13,326 --> 01:12:14,861
Get her yourself.

1398
01:12:16,683 --> 01:12:18,313
Oh...

1399
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:22,245
That's all you got me
out here for.

1400
01:12:22,341 --> 01:12:24,547
It's the craziest thing
I ever got into.

1401
01:12:24,643 --> 01:12:25,602
Shhh!

1402
01:12:25,698 --> 01:12:28,191
Hello? Hello, Vicky.

1403
01:12:29,726 --> 01:12:31,932
Of course it is.
Who did you think it was?

1404
01:12:32,028 --> 01:12:35,672
I...oh, fine.
I'm fine.

1405
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:38,489
Standing on my own two feet.

1406
01:12:38,549 --> 01:12:40,791
Vicky, we're going to fight.

1407
01:12:40,851 --> 01:12:43,092
This is the showdown.

1408
01:12:43,152 --> 01:12:45,262
Dev, where are you, anyhow?

1409
01:12:45,358 --> 01:12:47,696
And what are you talking about?

1410
01:12:47,756 --> 01:12:49,962
I'll tell you what to do.

1411
01:12:50,058 --> 01:12:52,743
Prepare a report.
Yes, that will do it.

1412
01:12:52,839 --> 01:12:55,524
Show the board...
you know what I mean...

1413
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,538
how everything went wrong.

1414
01:12:57,634 --> 01:12:59,396
The mess Mciver's
gotten us into.

1415
01:12:59,456 --> 01:13:04,383
You know, late hours, drinking...
Patients taking over the place.

1416
01:13:04,443 --> 01:13:05,822
Pour it on!

1417
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,411
And then we walk
into that meeting on Tuesday

1418
01:13:08,471 --> 01:13:10,905
and just throw it on the table.

1419
01:13:10,965 --> 01:13:12,883
What good will all that do?

1420
01:13:12,979 --> 01:13:14,705
Now listen, Vicky.

1421
01:13:14,801 --> 01:13:17,486
I'm going to clean house!

1422
01:13:17,582 --> 01:13:20,267
And you better be
on the right side, or out you go.

1423
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:21,994
Mciver wants you out.

1424
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:23,948
He's gone to Regina about it.

1425
01:13:24,008 --> 01:13:26,309
Sh-she told me, Vicky!

1426
01:13:26,405 --> 01:13:31,584
Mciver stays, and it's a-snickety bang,
off with your head. So...

1427
01:13:37,051 --> 01:13:39,832
woman: Maybe if the staff
could settle its problems,

1428
01:13:39,928 --> 01:13:41,462
the patients could
settle theirs.

1429
01:13:41,558 --> 01:13:42,937
Good point.

1430
01:13:42,997 --> 01:13:45,580
I promise you, we'll have a
policy meeting on this soon

1431
01:13:45,641 --> 01:13:47,348
as I can communicate
with Dr. Devanal.

1432
01:13:47,408 --> 01:13:49,266
The main point is
whether we have

1433
01:13:49,326 --> 01:13:51,184
self-government here at all.

1434
01:13:51,244 --> 01:13:54,253
And if we haven't,
don't tell us we have, Dr. Mciver.

1435
01:13:54,313 --> 01:13:56,807
Just hang up
any drapes you want,

1436
01:13:56,903 --> 01:14:00,739
and let's take all this rigamarole of
a committee and so and so,

1437
01:14:00,835 --> 01:14:02,657
and give it back to the Indians.

1438
01:14:02,753 --> 01:14:04,191
Or miss inch.

1439
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:08,603
Look, all I'm asking of you at
the moment is to be patient.

1440
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:10,521
What we're trying to
do here isn't easy.

1441
01:14:10,617 --> 01:14:12,919
Self-government never is.

1442
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:15,124
But I think we can
all put it through.

1443
01:14:15,220 --> 01:14:17,330
Anyway, let's try, hmm?

1444
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:22,605
Well, um...

1445
01:14:22,701 --> 01:14:24,139
Excuse me.

1446
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:31,272
Oh, well, uh,
I...I...I think, uh...

1447
01:14:31,332 --> 01:14:34,401
if you think they'll make any changes
around here, Holcomb,

1448
01:14:34,497 --> 01:14:36,607
you're just kidding yourself.

1449
01:14:36,703 --> 01:14:38,717
Karen, I'm in a meeting.
I haven't

1450
01:14:39,868 --> 01:14:42,841
Edna Devanal?
What does she want?

1451
01:14:42,937 --> 01:14:44,951
I don't know where he is.
Nobody seems to.

1452
01:14:45,046 --> 01:14:47,252
Just threw his
stink bomb and ran.

1453
01:14:47,348 --> 01:14:48,787
I thought maybe you did.

1454
01:14:48,883 --> 01:14:51,796
I haven't seen Dev since...

1455
01:14:51,856 --> 01:14:54,925
I have to talk
with you about us.

1456
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:57,130
I'm frightened
at what's happened.

1457
01:14:57,226 --> 01:14:58,761
Stewart, I...

1458
01:14:58,857 --> 01:15:00,679
Karen, I can't talk now.

1459
01:15:00,775 --> 01:15:03,592
Mr. Holcomb? Meeting over?

1460
01:15:03,652 --> 01:15:05,378
Adjourned.

1461
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:09,982
Dr. Mciver.

1462
01:15:10,077 --> 01:15:12,031
Yes, Mr. Capp.

1463
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:16,599
Uh...Holcomb's pretty upset.

1464
01:15:16,695 --> 01:15:18,613
Dr. Devanal missed
his hour today.

1465
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:19,991
I see.

1466
01:15:20,051 --> 01:15:22,449
By the way,
have you heard from Dr. Devanal?

1467
01:15:22,545 --> 01:15:24,175
Thank you.
No. No, I haven't.

1468
01:15:24,271 --> 01:15:28,158
Did, uh...
Did he cancel your hour, too?

1469
01:15:28,219 --> 01:15:32,579
Yes, but I don't get
hysterical like Holcomb.

1470
01:15:33,574 --> 01:15:34,725
I feel fine.

1471
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:36,216
Good. Good.
I'm glad to hear it.

1472
01:15:36,276 --> 01:15:37,402
Oh, miss Gavney.

1473
01:15:37,698 --> 01:15:38,945
Yes, doctor?

1474
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,923
Dr. Wolff will be here
all evening, won't he,

1475
01:15:40,983 --> 01:15:42,553
in case anyone wants
to talk to him?

1476
01:15:42,613 --> 01:15:43,843
Why, of course, sir.
He's...

1477
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,754
fine. Good night, miss Gavney.

1478
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:48,535
Good night, doctor.

1479
01:15:52,851 --> 01:15:54,097
Thank you.

1480
01:15:54,193 --> 01:15:55,536
Good night, Mr. Capp.

1481
01:16:10,305 --> 01:16:11,684
Oh, Abe.
You're so right.

1482
01:16:11,744 --> 01:16:13,566
The world's becoming dehydrated.

1483
01:16:13,662 --> 01:16:15,484
What they can't
dry up, they freeze.

1484
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:17,402
Slicing has become a lost art.

1485
01:16:17,498 --> 01:16:19,320
Now tell me, when did you last
see a woman

1486
01:16:19,416 --> 01:16:20,650
cutting an orange?

1487
01:16:20,746 --> 01:16:22,197
Listen, as far as I'm concerned,

1488
01:16:22,293 --> 01:16:24,032
the more art that's
lost, the better.

1489
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:27,088
Well, if it isn't
the good gray doctor!

1490
01:16:28,527 --> 01:16:29,522
Hello.

1491
01:16:29,582 --> 01:16:30,864
Rinehart: Come in. Come in.

1492
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:33,226
Thank you. I, uh,
saw the lights.

1493
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,614
Irwin: Have a seat.
Give him a glass of wine.

1494
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:38,465
Do you good. No, thanks.
I'll have to be getting along.

1495
01:16:40,611 --> 01:16:42,337
I, uh, just finished a meeting.

1496
01:16:42,433 --> 01:16:43,812
I don't think I did too well.

1497
01:16:43,872 --> 01:16:44,926
Oh.

1498
01:16:45,022 --> 01:16:46,269
Woman: Good evening.

1499
01:16:46,365 --> 01:16:49,242
Irwin: Careful with that, honey.
It's valuable.

1500
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:51,448
Rinehart: Doctor,
you haven't met Abe's wife.

1501
01:16:51,544 --> 01:16:52,586
Well, no.
I haven't.

1502
01:16:52,682 --> 01:16:54,596
Shirley, this is the
world-famous mind reader

1503
01:16:54,657 --> 01:16:56,179
and deep-sea diver,
the great Mciver.

1504
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:58,065
- How do you do?
- Very glad to know you.

1505
01:16:58,161 --> 01:17:00,211
Abe said it would be all right
if I came along.

1506
01:17:00,271 --> 01:17:01,230
I give him inspiration.

1507
01:17:01,326 --> 01:17:02,861
Good for you.

1508
01:17:02,956 --> 01:17:04,719
Well, Abe, how is
it going to work?

1509
01:17:04,779 --> 01:17:06,505
Ah, it's in the lap
of the gods, now.

1510
01:17:06,601 --> 01:17:09,094
You can only rely on my cool skill
and animal cunning.

1511
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:11,396
Mciver: Stevie really
got Wolff, didn't he?

1512
01:17:11,492 --> 01:17:13,954
Irwin: He's got your immaculate
scientific preoccupation.

1513
01:17:14,015 --> 01:17:16,671
Mrs. Irwin: Won't you have
something to eat with us, Dr.Mciver?

1514
01:17:16,767 --> 01:17:18,225
He just said no.
Don't ply the man.

1515
01:17:18,286 --> 01:17:19,744
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1516
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,174
I changed my mind.

1517
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:22,365
Ply me.

1518
01:17:22,425 --> 01:17:24,247
Good. Here.
Start with this.

1519
01:17:24,343 --> 01:17:25,477
Ah, spaghetti.
Wonderful.

1520
01:17:25,573 --> 01:17:28,036
Rinehart: Will you be able to
stay for a great experiment?

1521
01:17:28,097 --> 01:17:30,082
I don't know.
How long is it going to take, Abe?

1522
01:17:30,142 --> 01:17:31,456
Irwin: Ah, be patient, doctor.

1523
01:17:31,552 --> 01:17:33,099
This isn't something
you can toss off

1524
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:35,165
like mending a split
personality, or something.

1525
01:17:35,225 --> 01:17:36,187
This is art.

1526
01:17:36,247 --> 01:17:38,956
Well, Mrs. Irwin, I can see that
your child is going to be reared

1527
01:17:39,016 --> 01:17:40,838
with a healthy respect
for the arts.

1528
01:17:40,934 --> 01:17:43,716
Abe will have him painting like
the Venetians by the time he's 3.

1529
01:17:45,154 --> 01:17:47,014
Don't tell me you doctors
are going to start

1530
01:17:47,075 --> 01:17:48,975
analyzing kids before
they're even born, huh?

1531
01:17:49,845 --> 01:17:52,958
You wouldn't suspect it, but Abe's
pretty excited about being a father.

1532
01:17:53,018 --> 01:17:55,424
Rinehart: Everything is
debatable in life, except babies:

1533
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:57,074
Husbands, careers, art.

1534
01:17:57,334 --> 01:17:59,444
When a baby is around,
nothing else counts.

1535
01:18:00,595 --> 01:18:02,129
How right you are.

1536
01:18:02,705 --> 01:18:04,239
Irwin: Ta-da!

1537
01:18:06,253 --> 01:18:07,308
Irwin: How about that?

1538
01:18:07,404 --> 01:18:09,034
Mciver: Hey, that's good!
Isn't it?

1539
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:10,701
Stevie has a sardonic touch,

1540
01:18:10,761 --> 01:18:12,391
a sort of jovial Goya.

1541
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:13,729
I think more like Steinberg.

1542
01:18:13,825 --> 01:18:15,368
More like you're all
a little drunk.

1543
01:18:15,464 --> 01:18:16,459
Oh...

1544
01:18:16,519 --> 01:18:17,758
Abe's really very pleased.

1545
01:18:17,853 --> 01:18:19,832
It's difficult to tell,
but I've had experience.

1546
01:18:19,892 --> 01:18:22,365
- How do you tell?
- He eats.

1547
01:18:22,461 --> 01:18:24,331
Whenever he eats,
things are all right.

1548
01:18:24,392 --> 01:18:26,693
Oh, it used to worry me
before we were married...

1549
01:18:26,754 --> 01:18:28,119
for days at a time... nothing.

1550
01:18:28,215 --> 01:18:30,229
Then suddenly,
at 3:00 in the morning,

1551
01:18:30,325 --> 01:18:33,046
he'd get hungry, make me
get up and fix him a sandwich.

1552
01:18:33,106 --> 01:18:35,264
And from now on,
it's going to be me who will have

1553
01:18:35,325 --> 01:18:37,422
to get up at 3:00 in the
morning, warm the bottle.

1554
01:18:37,518 --> 01:18:38,548
Serves you right!

1555
01:18:38,644 --> 01:18:41,258
Hey, Shirley, you know, it's about
time you ought to be in bed.

1556
01:18:41,354 --> 01:18:42,937
We can go on with this
in the morning.

1557
01:18:42,997 --> 01:18:44,140
We can't leave this mess.

1558
01:18:44,235 --> 01:18:45,382
Leave it.

1559
01:18:45,478 --> 01:18:47,588
- How are you going to get home?
- I'll manage.

1560
01:18:47,684 --> 01:18:49,130
If you need a lift,
I'll drop you.

1561
01:18:49,226 --> 01:18:50,277
Fine. Take her home, Abe.

1562
01:18:50,373 --> 01:18:51,995
You're a good man
in a chin fest.

1563
01:18:52,191 --> 01:18:54,361
We ought to do this
again at my house sometime, doc.

1564
01:18:54,421 --> 01:18:55,400
Just say when.

1565
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,370
- Good night.
- Good night, Shirley.

1566
01:18:58,329 --> 01:18:59,863
Doc?
Yeah.

1567
01:19:00,822 --> 01:19:03,927
- You be sure to cure this kid, huh?
- We'll do our best, Abe.

1568
01:19:03,987 --> 01:19:05,234
See you.

1569
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:07,919
- Good night... And thanks a lot.
- Oh, any time, doctor.

1570
01:19:22,689 --> 01:19:25,470
- Nicest part of every party...
- Hmm?

1571
01:19:25,566 --> 01:19:26,525
When everybody leaves.

1572
01:19:26,621 --> 01:19:28,287
Oh. You want to wash or dry?

1573
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:29,594
I don't care.

1574
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:31,228
More sense
of accomplishment washing.

1575
01:19:31,324 --> 01:19:32,279
You wash.

1576
01:19:32,375 --> 01:19:33,766
All right. Will you get a towel?

1577
01:19:33,826 --> 01:19:35,300
The first cupboard
on the right...

1578
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,699
the one that says "clean rags".

1579
01:19:36,795 --> 01:19:38,138
Yes, ma'am.

1580
01:19:44,842 --> 01:19:46,988
* doo doo * there you are.

1581
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:48,679
Thank you.

1582
01:19:55,488 --> 01:19:57,825
How long were you married?

1583
01:19:57,885 --> 01:20:00,475
6 years, 8 months, and 2 days.

1584
01:20:00,571 --> 01:20:01,626
Oh...

1585
01:20:23,012 --> 01:20:24,115
Boy: Come on, you guys!

1586
01:20:24,176 --> 01:20:25,314
Let's go get some chow!

1587
01:20:25,410 --> 01:20:26,848
Hey! Hey!

1588
01:20:48,906 --> 01:20:51,148
Any regrets...

1589
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:53,258
Coming here and taking this job?

1590
01:20:53,318 --> 01:20:55,080
No.

1591
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,729
It's only partly true, you know,

1592
01:20:57,825 --> 01:21:00,319
that hard work cures all sorrow.

1593
01:21:00,415 --> 01:21:02,237
Is that what you think
I'm doing?

1594
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:04,191
Trying.

1595
01:21:04,251 --> 01:21:05,917
This, uh...

1596
01:21:05,977 --> 01:21:08,279
This work is a bridge for you,
isn't it?

1597
01:21:09,142 --> 01:21:11,348
To back among the living?

1598
01:21:11,444 --> 01:21:13,498
Mm-hmm.

1599
01:21:13,558 --> 01:21:14,784
Welcome back.

1600
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:17,713
You're young. You've got
a whole world ahead of you.

1601
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:20,111
It's up against
real competition...

1602
01:21:20,171 --> 01:21:21,837
the one behind me.

1603
01:21:21,897 --> 01:21:24,900
Yeah, I've been thinking
myself back into that one.

1604
01:21:24,961 --> 01:21:27,556
Well, uh,
"think" is probably the wrong word.

1605
01:21:27,651 --> 01:21:29,510
It's an impression...
A feeling,

1606
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:31,679
an atmosphere around you.

1607
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,557
Something inside.

1608
01:21:34,652 --> 01:21:36,283
Relax. Close your eyes.

1609
01:21:36,379 --> 01:21:38,393
That's what the couch is for.

1610
01:21:38,489 --> 01:21:41,114
All right.

1611
01:21:41,174 --> 01:21:43,667
You're in a small college town.

1612
01:21:44,531 --> 01:21:46,736
5-room yellow house.
Rented.

1613
01:21:47,983 --> 01:21:50,764
It's on a shady street
with a handful of others.

1614
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:53,641
And outside, peaceful sounds:

1615
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:57,609
A lawn mower clanking,

1616
01:21:57,669 --> 01:21:59,971
a piano playing.

1617
01:22:00,067 --> 01:22:01,062
In the first apartment

1618
01:22:01,122 --> 01:22:02,369
Karen and I had in Chicago,

1619
01:22:02,465 --> 01:22:04,574
the bathtub was in the kitchen.

1620
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:07,164
Small, cozy, no big problems.

1621
01:22:08,315 --> 01:22:09,849
Except when
the Murphy bed was down,

1622
01:22:09,945 --> 01:22:12,666
you couldn't open
the front door.

1623
01:22:12,726 --> 01:22:15,195
I'd come home from the hospital
at 5:00 in the morning,

1624
01:22:15,256 --> 01:22:16,814
and there'd be
coffee on the stove.

1625
01:22:21,358 --> 01:22:22,892
I wonder where Dev is.

1626
01:22:22,988 --> 01:22:25,230
He's probably drunk someplace.

1627
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:27,244
There's a real
deterioration in that man.

1628
01:22:27,304 --> 01:22:29,929
Now I'm going
to have to fight him

1629
01:22:29,989 --> 01:22:32,387
for the clinic,
and I don't want to.

1630
01:22:32,483 --> 01:22:33,565
Why not?

1631
01:22:33,625 --> 01:22:35,601
Because I remember him
when I was in training.

1632
01:22:35,662 --> 01:22:37,661
He and Collins were doing
really important work.

1633
01:22:37,757 --> 01:22:39,963
Is that why you've been
covering for him here?

1634
01:22:40,059 --> 01:22:42,492
What do you think
it would do to the patients

1635
01:22:42,552 --> 01:22:45,334
to see us at each
other's throats?

1636
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:47,444
You know what I'd really like?

1637
01:22:47,539 --> 01:22:48,699
What?

1638
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:52,179
To get back to that
feeling I had in the bar.

1639
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:54,540
Talk, wine...

1640
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,459
Beer wouldn't do?

1641
01:22:56,554 --> 01:22:58,700
Uh-uh. Wrong mood.

1642
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:01,350
I'll put it in a red glass.

1643
01:23:03,076 --> 01:23:04,419
All right.

1644
01:23:36,834 --> 01:23:38,500
Could I use your phone?

1645
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,287
Oh, yes.
Right over there.

1646
01:23:40,383 --> 01:23:41,821
Thank you.

1647
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:53,521
Miss Kubiecki?
This is Dr. Mciver.

1648
01:23:53,617 --> 01:23:56,207
Have you heard from
Dr. Devanal yet?

1649
01:23:56,303 --> 01:23:58,125
Nothing, huh?

1650
01:23:58,221 --> 01:24:00,618
She does? Well,
switch me through to her, please.

1651
01:24:02,536 --> 01:24:05,222
Oh, hello, miss Gavney.

1652
01:24:05,318 --> 01:24:07,236
Who?

1653
01:24:07,332 --> 01:24:09,286
Oh, Mr. Capp.

1654
01:24:09,346 --> 01:24:11,168
Yes. Yes, he'll need sedation.

1655
01:24:11,264 --> 01:24:13,757
That's all right.
You can give it to him.

1656
01:24:13,853 --> 01:24:15,903
And if Dr. Wolff needs me,

1657
01:24:15,963 --> 01:24:18,588
I'm at 6258.

1658
01:24:18,648 --> 01:24:20,087
Mm-hmm.

1659
01:24:20,183 --> 01:24:21,621
Good night.

1660
01:25:14,369 --> 01:25:16,670
Hello. This is Mrs. Mciver.

1661
01:25:16,766 --> 01:25:19,775
Is my...
Is Dr. Mciver there?

1662
01:25:19,835 --> 01:25:22,269
Well, I...
It's rather urgent.

1663
01:25:22,329 --> 01:25:24,822
Oh, yes, thank you.
Give me the number if you will.

1664
01:25:26,261 --> 01:25:27,891
Thank you.

1665
01:25:35,084 --> 01:25:37,673
Rinehart: Hello?

1666
01:25:37,769 --> 01:25:39,244
Who is this?

1667
01:25:39,304 --> 01:25:40,838
Hello?

1668
01:25:47,647 --> 01:25:50,656
Information, 6258.

1669
01:25:50,716 --> 01:25:52,634
Under whose name is
that number listed?

1670
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:56,027
Operator: I'm sorry.
We are unable to give this information.

1671
01:25:56,087 --> 01:25:58,484
We do not list
by telephone number.

1672
01:27:28,922 --> 01:27:32,183
It's hard for everybody,
but particularly for us...

1673
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:36,019
Because all the sick
feelings out of the past

1674
01:27:36,115 --> 01:27:37,937
hook onto things in the present.

1675
01:27:45,321 --> 01:27:47,623
Now, this...

1676
01:27:47,719 --> 01:27:50,404
Being with you right now...

1677
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,934
Is real, only...

1678
01:27:52,994 --> 01:27:55,487
My feelings about now...

1679
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:57,921
How do I know where
they come from,

1680
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:01,337
or have I got them
all mixed up with something else?

1681
01:28:12,462 --> 01:28:14,320
Good night, Stevie.

1682
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:16,107
Thank you for taking me.

1683
01:28:16,202 --> 01:28:17,965
I couldn't have
done it by myself.

1684
01:28:18,025 --> 01:28:20,806
I couldn't have gone
with anyone else but you.

1685
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:25,601
Good night.

1686
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:54,180
Well, Mr. Capp,
you must be as drowsy as a kitten.

1687
01:28:54,276 --> 01:28:57,189
How about bed now...
And some sleep?

1688
01:28:57,249 --> 01:29:00,894
That's the wittiest remark
since the passing of Oscar Wilde.

1689
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:03,999
Oh, Mr. Capp,
I gave you some sedation.

1690
01:29:04,059 --> 01:29:05,977
Yeah. Two capsules.

1691
01:29:07,223 --> 01:29:09,717
Are you sure the clinic
can spare it?

1692
01:29:09,813 --> 01:29:14,800
Mr. Capp, would it help if I
called in Dr. Wolff to talk to you?

1693
01:29:14,896 --> 01:29:16,466
Miss Gavney, please!

1694
01:29:16,526 --> 01:29:18,444
One doctor at a time.

1695
01:29:20,266 --> 01:29:23,659
Let's not interfere
with good old Devanal's work.

1696
01:29:23,719 --> 01:29:27,843
Ha! He's making me fit
to face the world.

1697
01:29:29,473 --> 01:29:32,866
The futility
and the emptiness...

1698
01:29:32,926 --> 01:29:35,131
The hydrogen bomb...

1699
01:29:36,378 --> 01:29:39,159
Say, I may even be fit
to cope with my mother!

1700
01:29:41,173 --> 01:29:44,338
There's a formidable
woman, miss Gavney...

1701
01:29:44,434 --> 01:29:47,059
quick of eye, steady of hand.

1702
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:49,805
Never been known to miss
with a knife in the back.

1703
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:56,746
* "m" is for the million
things she gave me *

1704
01:29:56,806 --> 01:30:02,021
* "o" means only that
she's growing old *

1705
01:30:02,081 --> 01:30:06,876
* "t" is for the tears
were shed to save me *

1706
01:30:06,972 --> 01:30:11,287
* "h" is for her heart
of purest gold *

1707
01:30:24,810 --> 01:30:26,344
Good morning, mark.

1708
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:27,975
Morning.

1709
01:30:28,742 --> 01:30:30,372
Mother not down yet?

1710
01:30:30,468 --> 01:30:31,907
She's gone.

1711
01:30:32,674 --> 01:30:35,071
Gone? Where?

1712
01:30:35,167 --> 01:30:37,853
To the Springs.
She took Rosie with her.

1713
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:41,209
You're supposed to take me

1714
01:30:41,305 --> 01:30:43,799
over to Billy Hormeyer's
for the weekend.

1715
01:30:43,895 --> 01:30:45,621
Sadie's not here yet.

1716
01:30:46,868 --> 01:30:50,128
Yeah, I'll... All right,
whenever you're ready.

1717
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:53,869
I'll get breakfast
at the clinic.

1718
01:31:05,185 --> 01:31:06,528
So long.

1719
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,254
Good-bye, dad.

1720
01:31:40,478 --> 01:31:41,725
Is Dr. Mciver here yet?

1721
01:31:41,821 --> 01:31:43,163
Should be any minute.

1722
01:31:43,259 --> 01:31:45,657
Well, please let me
know the minute he comes in.

1723
01:31:45,753 --> 01:31:47,671
I'll be at breakfast.

1724
01:31:52,466 --> 01:31:54,708
No. No, no, Mrs. Devanal.

1725
01:31:54,768 --> 01:31:57,105
We haven't heard
from the doctor yet.

1726
01:31:57,165 --> 01:31:59,407
Yes. Yes, I'll be sure
to call you.

1727
01:31:59,467 --> 01:32:02,152
Mr. Capp, why don't you
go in to breakfast?

1728
01:32:02,248 --> 01:32:04,262
I'll call you as soon
as the doctor arrives.

1729
01:32:04,358 --> 01:32:05,588
I'd rather stay here.

1730
01:32:05,884 --> 01:32:08,098
Cobby, did you know that
Thomas Edison never slept

1731
01:32:08,194 --> 01:32:10,216
more than 42 minutes
a night in his whole life?

1732
01:32:10,312 --> 01:32:11,682
No wonder he tinkered around.

1733
01:32:11,743 --> 01:32:13,565
Rinehart: Dr. Mciver!

1734
01:32:17,305 --> 01:32:19,415
It's Stevie!

1735
01:32:27,183 --> 01:32:29,773
I've taken all I'm gonna take
of these loonies!

1736
01:32:29,869 --> 01:32:32,074
Look at that.
I tried to stop him.

1737
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:34,028
He was smashing the window.

1738
01:32:34,088 --> 01:32:36,678
He was trying to break down the door
when curly stopped him.

1739
01:32:43,295 --> 01:32:45,309
Curly got cut
with the broken glass.

1740
01:32:45,405 --> 01:32:46,844
Curly, what started this?

1741
01:32:46,939 --> 01:32:47,994
How should I know?

1742
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:49,625
Man: Dr. Mciver!

1743
01:32:49,721 --> 01:32:50,947
Dr. Mciver, I demand to know

1744
01:32:51,043 --> 01:32:54,089
why those new drapes are put up in
the library, considering your promise!

1745
01:32:54,149 --> 01:32:55,383
What drapes?
Flowered brocade.

1746
01:32:55,479 --> 01:32:57,305
A very striking effect,
as a matter of fact.

1747
01:32:57,401 --> 01:32:59,119
Curly, did you see
which way he went?

1748
01:32:59,215 --> 01:33:02,092
Last I saw him, he was hightailing
it river way. Good riddance!

1749
01:33:18,588 --> 01:33:20,890
Stevie!

1750
01:33:29,904 --> 01:33:31,727
Stevie!

1751
01:33:39,591 --> 01:33:41,509
Stevie!

1752
01:34:08,746 --> 01:34:10,700
Doctor, something has to be done

1753
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:12,582
about the noise in the annex.

1754
01:34:12,678 --> 01:34:16,418
It's impossible to rest. If something isn't
done, I'm going to call the police myself!

1755
01:34:16,514 --> 01:34:18,240
Miss Robbins,
you will do no such thing.

1756
01:34:18,336 --> 01:34:19,915
If you'll please go
back to your room.

1757
01:34:19,975 --> 01:34:21,981
I assure you,
everything possible is being done.

1758
01:34:22,042 --> 01:34:24,216
The state highway patrol
has been trying to get you.

1759
01:34:24,277 --> 01:34:26,408
I told them you'd call
just as soon as you got in.

1760
01:34:26,504 --> 01:34:27,655
All right, get them for me,

1761
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:29,385
and put the call
through in my office.

1762
01:34:29,481 --> 01:34:31,487
Dr. Mciver, I came to this place
to be helped,

1763
01:34:31,583 --> 01:34:33,105
not to be driven out of my mind!

1764
01:34:33,201 --> 01:34:34,831
Miss Robbins,
perhaps you can tell me.

1765
01:34:34,927 --> 01:34:37,194
The noise upstairs,
and the laughing and the dancing...

1766
01:34:37,254 --> 01:34:38,201
How bad is it, Tim?

1767
01:34:38,296 --> 01:34:40,122
Pretty bad. We have
a very disturbed house.

1768
01:34:40,218 --> 01:34:42,672
There's been a lot of talk all day
about those new drapes,

1769
01:34:42,732 --> 01:34:44,790
and now this rumor about
Steven Holte's suicide.

1770
01:34:44,851 --> 01:34:47,422
They each read themselves into
it, and I never know what's...

1771
01:34:47,483 --> 01:34:49,994
Dr. Mciver, I found Mrs.
Demuth drunk in Mr. Appleton's room.

1772
01:34:50,054 --> 01:34:52,364
You see? I tried to persuade
her to go back to her own.

1773
01:34:52,425 --> 01:34:54,097
Dr. Mciver,
state highway patrol calling.

1774
01:34:54,157 --> 01:34:55,367
Does Demuth know I'm here?

1775
01:34:55,463 --> 01:34:56,414
I'll go up.

1776
01:34:56,510 --> 01:34:57,597
Doctor...

1777
01:34:57,657 --> 01:34:59,515
I'll see to it.

1778
01:34:59,575 --> 01:35:01,589
Mciver.

1779
01:35:01,685 --> 01:35:02,931
That's right.

1780
01:35:03,027 --> 01:35:05,269
I called the sheriff's
office around 2:00.

1781
01:35:05,329 --> 01:35:06,863
Definitely not.

1782
01:35:06,959 --> 01:35:08,817
He's not dangerous
to anybody but himself.

1783
01:35:08,877 --> 01:35:11,275
Don't send an officer out here.
I'll come down there.

1784
01:35:15,399 --> 01:35:17,029
Dr. Mciver, what'll I do about...

1785
01:35:17,125 --> 01:35:18,216
later, Mrs. O'brien.

1786
01:35:18,276 --> 01:35:20,002
Mrs. O'brien...

1787
01:35:26,140 --> 01:35:28,154
Mrs. O'brien!

1788
01:35:28,250 --> 01:35:29,237
Yes, doctor?

1789
01:35:29,297 --> 01:35:31,031
I want you to take these
down right away.

1790
01:35:31,127 --> 01:35:33,625
But, doctor... take them down
before more patients see them.

1791
01:35:33,721 --> 01:35:35,003
But what will I do with them?

1792
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:37,057
I don't care what you do with them...
anything!

1793
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:39,052
Put them in my car.
I'll take them to the dump!

1794
01:35:39,112 --> 01:35:41,510
But don't you think we ought to wait
until Dr. Devanal...

1795
01:35:54,911 --> 01:35:56,542
Stewart!

1796
01:36:01,721 --> 01:36:03,063
Where have you been?

1797
01:36:03,159 --> 01:36:05,305
Been? I've been
to the airport to meet Regina.

1798
01:36:05,365 --> 01:36:07,415
We had a few things
to talk about.

1799
01:36:07,475 --> 01:36:08,913
Just got in.

1800
01:36:09,009 --> 01:36:10,256
Now, look here...

1801
01:36:10,352 --> 01:36:12,114
Then you haven't heard
about Steven Holte.

1802
01:36:12,174 --> 01:36:13,613
No. Why?

1803
01:36:13,709 --> 01:36:15,950
Is he...Was he very disturbed?

1804
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:18,312
I'd say so, Dev,
assuming he's still alive.

1805
01:36:18,408 --> 01:36:19,463
One of the patients?

1806
01:36:19,559 --> 01:36:20,518
My patient.

1807
01:36:20,614 --> 01:36:23,395
Stewart, aren't you being
a little melodramatic, perhaps?

1808
01:36:23,491 --> 01:36:25,157
You know this boy's history!

1809
01:36:25,217 --> 01:36:26,691
If you don't, why don't you come

1810
01:36:26,751 --> 01:36:29,377
to staff meeting
once in a while and find out?!

1811
01:36:29,437 --> 01:36:31,295
What are you in
this business for...

1812
01:36:31,355 --> 01:36:32,985
to cure patients
or to kill them?!

1813
01:36:33,081 --> 01:36:35,671
I didn't put up those drapes.
You know that.

1814
01:36:35,766 --> 01:36:38,164
Dev, if this boy kills himself,

1815
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:40,693
I'll drive you so far
out of the profession,

1816
01:36:40,753 --> 01:36:42,384
you'll never find your way back!

1817
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:43,614
Now, look here, Stewart!

1818
01:36:43,810 --> 01:36:46,316
If I were you, I would not make
accusations you may regret.

1819
01:36:46,412 --> 01:36:47,511
I'll regret nothing!

1820
01:36:47,571 --> 01:36:49,001
Now, just a minute!

1821
01:36:49,097 --> 01:36:50,823
This boy has
a history of suicide.

1822
01:36:50,919 --> 01:36:53,125
Do you mean to tell me
that knowing that,

1823
01:36:53,221 --> 01:36:55,235
you gave him
the run of the clinic,

1824
01:36:55,331 --> 01:36:57,633
let him become some kind
of celebrity around here?

1825
01:36:57,728 --> 01:36:59,838
Why wasn't he sent
to a closed hospital?

1826
01:36:59,934 --> 01:37:02,080
Because I'm a doctor,
not a jailer!

1827
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:04,286
Mac, before the rest of
the board arrives,

1828
01:37:04,346 --> 01:37:05,497
I insist on a clarification

1829
01:37:05,593 --> 01:37:06,971
of what's going on down here.

1830
01:37:07,031 --> 01:37:08,314
I hear these rumors...

1831
01:37:08,374 --> 01:37:09,716
What rumors, Regina?

1832
01:37:09,812 --> 01:37:12,594
About laxity in the treatment
of patients... incompetence.

1833
01:37:12,689 --> 01:37:14,799
I want to know if there's any
basis to them.

1834
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:16,430
Does Dev suggest there is?

1835
01:37:16,526 --> 01:37:18,636
Certainly not.
He completely denies them.

1836
01:37:18,731 --> 01:37:19,882
Same thing.

1837
01:37:19,978 --> 01:37:23,047
Mac, I take a serious
view of this.

1838
01:37:23,143 --> 01:37:24,234
Yes, so do I.

1839
01:37:24,294 --> 01:37:26,404
Don't try to run this place
single-handed.

1840
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,358
We have a responsibility
to the trustees.

1841
01:37:28,418 --> 01:37:29,952
But not to the patients, huh?

1842
01:37:30,048 --> 01:37:31,235
The patients are yours.

1843
01:37:31,295 --> 01:37:34,364
Regina, the trustees can't run the
clinic without knowing the clinic,

1844
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:36,534
and you can't know the
clinic sitting in Chicago!

1845
01:37:36,595 --> 01:37:38,988
Well, from what I've seen here
in the past few minutes...

1846
01:37:39,049 --> 01:37:41,010
well, take a few more minutes.
I can't talk now.

1847
01:37:41,106 --> 01:37:42,899
- Mac!
- Not now!

1848
01:37:47,215 --> 01:37:49,996
I just don't understand.
What are they doing?

1849
01:37:50,955 --> 01:37:53,545
They are mourning, Mrs. O'brien.

1850
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:57,093
I think that's what
your people would call...

1851
01:37:57,189 --> 01:37:58,723
A wake.

1852
01:38:08,122 --> 01:38:10,040
Mr. Capp.

1853
01:38:11,287 --> 01:38:13,109
Mr. Capp!

1854
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:21,453
Capp: Man shall not minister
to my disease,

1855
01:38:21,549 --> 01:38:25,289
plucked from the memory
of rooted sorrow.

1856
01:38:26,344 --> 01:38:29,509
Raise up the hidden
troubles of the brain,

1857
01:38:30,755 --> 01:38:36,030
and, with some sweet,
oblivious antidote,

1858
01:38:36,126 --> 01:38:37,600
cleanse the...

1859
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:40,633
Mr. Capp, won't you
come to bed now?

1860
01:38:42,647 --> 01:38:44,949
Mrs. O'brien,
did I ever tell you

1861
01:38:45,045 --> 01:38:47,251
you reminded me of my mother?

1862
01:38:48,498 --> 01:38:53,485
And, with some sweet,
oblivious antidote,

1863
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:57,321
cleanse the...
Bosom from that...

1864
01:39:16,502 --> 01:39:18,899
Hello, Otto.
I'm glad you're here.

1865
01:39:18,995 --> 01:39:20,817
I want to talk to you.

1866
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:22,735
Mrs. Devanal is in your office.

1867
01:39:22,831 --> 01:39:24,653
Mrs. Devanal?
What does she want?

1868
01:39:24,749 --> 01:39:27,722
I don't know.
She's been waiting for some time.

1869
01:39:34,148 --> 01:39:35,778
Hello, Edna.

1870
01:39:38,272 --> 01:39:40,382
What can I do for you?

1871
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:44,601
I'm sorry about
the boy, Stewart.

1872
01:39:44,697 --> 01:39:47,706
I've been trying to make up
my mind all night.

1873
01:39:47,766 --> 01:39:50,835
I know how you feel about Dev.

1874
01:39:50,931 --> 01:39:53,808
I can't justify
anything he's done.

1875
01:39:56,781 --> 01:40:00,809
Stewart... Don't you care at all
what happens to him?

1876
01:40:00,905 --> 01:40:02,535
I'm sorry, Edna.
It's not personal,

1877
01:40:02,631 --> 01:40:05,413
but I can't let Dev
go on like this.

1878
01:40:05,508 --> 01:40:09,249
But can't you do it some way...
some other way?

1879
01:40:09,345 --> 01:40:11,490
That's all I ask.

1880
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:14,715
Just...Not this way.

1881
01:40:17,401 --> 01:40:19,510
Can it really matter
how many times

1882
01:40:19,606 --> 01:40:22,388
he's been at the realton hotel
with miss Cobb?

1883
01:40:24,018 --> 01:40:25,648
If it doesn't matter to me...

1884
01:40:25,744 --> 01:40:29,424
I've been through all that so long
and gotten used to it...

1885
01:40:29,484 --> 01:40:31,882
what can it matter
to anyone else?

1886
01:40:31,978 --> 01:40:33,932
If it's true
he really mishandled

1887
01:40:33,992 --> 01:40:36,773
the two cases
mentioned in there,

1888
01:40:36,869 --> 01:40:39,458
I suppose that is
serious, but mistakes...

1889
01:40:39,554 --> 01:40:41,760
have you any idea what it is

1890
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:44,733
to live in the same
house with a man

1891
01:40:44,829 --> 01:40:49,859
who hasn't brought his
problems to you for 10 years?

1892
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:54,000
But, Stewart,
if he loses his pride now...

1893
01:40:54,899 --> 01:40:57,009
He'll be through.

1894
01:40:57,776 --> 01:41:00,557
That's all he has left.

1895
01:41:03,339 --> 01:41:05,161
Edna...

1896
01:41:06,408 --> 01:41:08,649
Where did you get this?

1897
01:41:08,709 --> 01:41:13,313
It...Came to the house last night
by messenger.

1898
01:41:13,409 --> 01:41:15,806
I know I shouldn't
have opened it,

1899
01:41:15,902 --> 01:41:17,820
but Dev wasn't there, and...

1900
01:41:17,916 --> 01:41:19,199
I was so worried.

1901
01:41:19,259 --> 01:41:20,601
Has Dev seen it?

1902
01:41:20,697 --> 01:41:21,944
No.

1903
01:41:25,588 --> 01:41:26,919
Sally, get miss inch in here.

1904
01:41:27,015 --> 01:41:28,274
Mrs. Mitchell-Smythe called.

1905
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:29,520
The board meeting is for...

1906
01:41:29,616 --> 01:41:31,438
I want miss inch!

1907
01:41:33,548 --> 01:41:36,330
Dr. Mciver's office.
Who's calling, please?

1908
01:41:36,425 --> 01:41:39,398
Yes, just one moment, lieutenant.
He's right here.

1909
01:41:39,494 --> 01:41:41,317
Yes?

1910
01:41:41,412 --> 01:41:42,755
What?

1911
01:41:42,851 --> 01:41:44,769
Where?

1912
01:41:46,399 --> 01:41:48,318
Lieutenant!

1913
01:41:48,413 --> 01:41:50,523
Can you identify this, doctor?

1914
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:54,551
That shoe could've
been in the river for 3 years.

1915
01:41:54,647 --> 01:41:56,086
It doesn't mean he's drowned!

1916
01:41:56,182 --> 01:41:59,059
No one says it does,
but it's the nearest we've come.

1917
01:41:59,155 --> 01:42:00,150
Where'd you find it?

1918
01:42:00,210 --> 01:42:01,556
Out over there in that mudbank.

1919
01:42:01,652 --> 01:42:03,566
We figure that's where
he entered the river.

1920
01:42:03,662 --> 01:42:06,872
We're going to start dragging all
through here and work downstream.

1921
01:42:06,933 --> 01:42:09,764
Cal, let's get over to those
other two boats by the bridge.

1922
01:42:11,622 --> 01:42:13,924
Keep that searchlight
on us over here!

1923
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:17,568
Lieutenant Ferguson...
tangled in the lines of your hook!

1924
01:42:17,664 --> 01:42:19,295
We've gone too far!

1925
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:23,131
Dr. Mciver!
Boat 5 hooked something!

1926
01:42:36,749 --> 01:42:38,415
Man: Something's on the hook!

1927
01:42:38,475 --> 01:42:41,065
Second man:
I think we've snagged a body!

1928
01:42:46,148 --> 01:42:48,353
Do you want me
to take you to him?

1929
01:42:48,449 --> 01:42:51,422
No, he wouldn't
want me. Not now.

1930
01:42:53,436 --> 01:42:55,007
I'll be at home.

1931
01:42:55,067 --> 01:42:59,382
Will you call me,
let me know if there's anything?

1932
01:42:59,478 --> 01:43:02,451
Karen, forgive me.
I shall presume.

1933
01:43:02,547 --> 01:43:06,959
Tomorrow... Or whenever this ends,
if he will let you, go to him, help him.

1934
01:43:07,055 --> 01:43:09,392
He has much to work through.

1935
01:43:09,452 --> 01:43:12,042
Don't nurse your wounds.

1936
01:43:12,138 --> 01:43:14,152
Nurse his.

1937
01:43:14,919 --> 01:43:16,549
Thank you.

1938
01:43:26,427 --> 01:43:28,250
Pull it in slow!

1939
01:43:28,345 --> 01:43:29,592
What is it?

1940
01:43:29,688 --> 01:43:31,031
It's only a Fender.

1941
01:43:31,127 --> 01:43:33,141
You've just hooked a Fender!

1942
01:43:45,033 --> 01:43:46,855
Meg, I'm not going
to stand around

1943
01:43:46,951 --> 01:43:49,253
waiting for them
to bring up the body.

1944
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:50,499
I can't take any more.

1945
01:43:50,595 --> 01:43:52,226
Any more of waiting?

1946
01:43:52,321 --> 01:43:54,048
Any more of myself.

1947
01:43:54,144 --> 01:43:58,024
Everything I've put my hand to
flies apart like a straw man...

1948
01:43:58,085 --> 01:43:59,934
wife, kids, Dev... Now Stevie.

1949
01:43:59,994 --> 01:44:04,405
What kind of a fool was I to think
I could take care of all that?

1950
01:44:04,501 --> 01:44:06,455
I can't even
take care of myself.

1951
01:44:06,515 --> 01:44:09,165
I'm no more fit to be
in this job than Dev is.

1952
01:44:09,226 --> 01:44:12,209
Well, let somebody else try
to put it together again.

1953
01:44:12,269 --> 01:44:13,552
It won't be me.

1954
01:44:13,612 --> 01:44:15,566
Why don't they just
leave it where it is?

1955
01:44:15,626 --> 01:44:17,640
You know the way a stiff acts?

1956
01:44:17,736 --> 01:44:20,869
It goes down to the bottom.
It don't drift away.

1957
01:44:20,930 --> 01:44:24,701
Just lays there until it bloats
enough to come to the top.

1958
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:47,310
Oh, Meg...

1959
01:44:47,370 --> 01:44:50,859
Oh, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg...

1960
01:44:50,919 --> 01:44:53,700
It seems a long time.

1961
01:44:53,796 --> 01:44:55,522
A long time.

1962
01:44:55,618 --> 01:44:58,879
I've been living in a dream
these last few days.

1963
01:44:58,975 --> 01:45:02,080
It has to stop.
I have to wake up.

1964
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:06,299
I've been playing family again
with you and Stevie.

1965
01:45:06,359 --> 01:45:08,469
It was a wonderful dream.

1966
01:45:08,565 --> 01:45:12,114
I was dead for a long time,
and now I'm alive...

1967
01:45:12,209 --> 01:45:13,552
For which I thank you.

1968
01:45:13,648 --> 01:45:16,273
Meg, listen to me.
Nothing has to stop.

1969
01:45:16,333 --> 01:45:18,156
I think it does.

1970
01:45:18,251 --> 01:45:20,781
We can't stay out
any longer just to find a body.

1971
01:45:20,841 --> 01:45:23,238
Bring in the boats!

1972
01:45:24,581 --> 01:45:25,768
That's it!

1973
01:45:25,828 --> 01:45:27,110
I think I'm something...

1974
01:45:27,170 --> 01:45:30,719
something you had once
or wanted once, and...

1975
01:45:30,815 --> 01:45:33,788
It's easier for you
to start again with me

1976
01:45:33,884 --> 01:45:35,802
than go back and get Karen.

1977
01:45:35,898 --> 01:45:37,432
No, no, no, Meg...

1978
01:45:37,528 --> 01:45:39,866
I wonder if she doesn't need
some of the strength

1979
01:45:39,926 --> 01:45:42,167
you've tried to give
Stevie and me.

1980
01:45:42,227 --> 01:45:44,433
Maybe it's too late for that.

1981
01:45:44,529 --> 01:45:47,372
Well, leave her, then,
but don't make her suffer...

1982
01:45:47,433 --> 01:45:50,379
While you and I clutch at
our dreams in odd moments...

1983
01:45:50,475 --> 01:45:52,297
please don't!

1984
01:45:52,393 --> 01:45:54,060
Don't.

1985
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:56,613
I could do that, too.

1986
01:45:56,709 --> 01:46:00,257
I almost want you that much.

1987
01:46:01,121 --> 01:46:03,326
Just not quite.

1988
01:46:03,422 --> 01:46:05,148
Not quite.

1989
01:46:08,601 --> 01:46:09,944
Well...

1990
01:46:10,807 --> 01:46:13,492
What should I do, Meg?

1991
01:46:17,232 --> 01:46:21,260
Who do you...
Think I am?

1992
01:47:24,941 --> 01:47:26,415
I'm late for the meeting.

1993
01:47:26,475 --> 01:47:30,407
I know. I want to talk to you
a minute before you go in.

1994
01:47:43,162 --> 01:47:45,368
When did you send
this out, Vicky?

1995
01:47:45,464 --> 01:47:46,999
I worked on it
Saturday and Sunday

1996
01:47:47,094 --> 01:47:49,492
and called a messenger
and sent it to your house.

1997
01:47:49,588 --> 01:47:52,213
I didn't get it.
I haven't been home.

1998
01:47:52,273 --> 01:47:54,383
This is Dev's copy.

1999
01:47:55,342 --> 01:47:57,164
But I...
Don't understand.

2000
01:47:57,260 --> 01:47:58,735
I thought...

2001
01:47:58,795 --> 01:48:01,672
All right, I believe in calling
a spade a spade.

2002
01:48:01,768 --> 01:48:04,508
You may be interested in
knowing that Dr. Devanal.

2003
01:48:04,569 --> 01:48:08,002
suggested that I prepare just
such a report as that against you.

2004
01:48:08,097 --> 01:48:10,111
Vicky, I hope,
for your own peace,

2005
01:48:10,207 --> 01:48:12,449
you won't present
that thing at the meeting.

2006
01:48:12,509 --> 01:48:14,715
And if I led you
to believe I wanted

2007
01:48:14,811 --> 01:48:18,455
that kind of help
from you, forgive me.

2008
01:48:23,634 --> 01:48:25,072
I understand that the drapes

2009
01:48:25,168 --> 01:48:27,182
hung in the library by your wife

2010
01:48:27,278 --> 01:48:28,753
were removed by you yesterday.

2011
01:48:28,813 --> 01:48:30,155
You will appreciate, Dr. Mciver,

2012
01:48:30,251 --> 01:48:32,280
that regardless of their
origin or suitability,

2013
01:48:32,341 --> 01:48:33,844
they are the property
of the clinic.

2014
01:48:33,904 --> 01:48:36,014
I must ask that they
be returned at once.

2015
01:49:09,188 --> 01:49:10,819
Vicky.

2016
01:49:22,807 --> 01:49:25,240
Under the circumstances,

2017
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:27,698
I suggest we dispense
with the customary agenda

2018
01:49:27,794 --> 01:49:29,904
and get to the essentials.

2019
01:49:29,999 --> 01:49:32,205
I understand
miss inch has a report

2020
01:49:32,301 --> 01:49:34,351
which she believes may
clarify certain aspects

2021
01:49:34,411 --> 01:49:36,617
of our present situation.

2022
01:49:46,687 --> 01:49:49,660
Miss inch, may we
have your report?

2023
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,126
I have no report...

2024
01:49:55,222 --> 01:49:57,620
Except the usual financial ones.

2025
01:49:59,538 --> 01:50:01,456
Much the same as last year.

2026
01:50:01,552 --> 01:50:04,237
Read them yourselves
to save time.

2027
01:50:18,815 --> 01:50:20,157
Regina, if I may,

2028
01:50:20,253 --> 01:50:22,747
I think I can save you
some time, too.

2029
01:50:24,761 --> 01:50:26,870
You all know what's happened.

2030
01:50:26,966 --> 01:50:29,748
None of it can be undone.

2031
01:50:29,844 --> 01:50:32,145
But what we can do
is learn from it.

2032
01:50:34,063 --> 01:50:36,845
Out of our needs
and our passions here,

2033
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:40,393
we've...We've spun
a human cobweb,

2034
01:50:40,489 --> 01:50:42,503
and this boy's
been caught in it.

2035
01:50:42,599 --> 01:50:45,092
I know that a lot
of what's happened

2036
01:50:45,188 --> 01:50:47,202
is my responsibility.

2037
01:50:47,298 --> 01:50:50,175
I think I forgot
that if an analyst

2038
01:50:50,271 --> 01:50:54,239
is to be of any real help
to the people he cares for,

2039
01:50:54,299 --> 01:50:58,039
it must come out of
the way he lives.

2040
01:50:58,135 --> 01:51:01,588
Not just from how much he knows
or how hard he works.

2041
01:51:01,684 --> 01:51:04,177
We live very close
together here,

2042
01:51:04,273 --> 01:51:06,479
patients and staff.

2043
01:51:06,575 --> 01:51:09,260
And we bring everything we are...

2044
01:51:10,123 --> 01:51:13,288
strong and weak, good and bad...

2045
01:51:13,959 --> 01:51:16,489
to the smallest act.

2046
01:51:16,549 --> 01:51:20,900
If we realize this
and accept and use it,

2047
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:24,413
that's the only way I know
of reconciling ourselves

2048
01:51:24,509 --> 01:51:26,139
to the present trouble

2049
01:51:26,235 --> 01:51:30,263
and trying to prevent
its happening in the future.

2050
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:34,039
Now as to the conduct
of the clinic,

2051
01:51:34,099 --> 01:51:37,072
my basic views haven't changed.

2052
01:51:37,168 --> 01:51:38,511
More than ever,

2053
01:51:38,607 --> 01:51:41,424
I believe the self-
government program

2054
01:51:41,484 --> 01:51:43,594
is inevitable and right.

2055
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:45,931
And the risks we take under it

2056
01:51:45,991 --> 01:51:48,389
with a patient like Steven Holte

2057
01:51:48,485 --> 01:51:50,343
are calculated and worthwhile.

2058
01:51:50,403 --> 01:51:52,705
If I stay here...

2059
01:51:54,143 --> 01:51:56,001
I propose to continue and extend

2060
01:51:56,061 --> 01:51:58,171
the present program.

2061
01:51:59,706 --> 01:52:02,679
Whether I do or not
is for you to decide.

2062
01:52:31,642 --> 01:52:34,171
"Having been associated
with this clinic

2063
01:52:34,231 --> 01:52:38,451
"and many of its employees
for over 1/4 of a century,

2064
01:52:38,547 --> 01:52:40,081
"it is with a deep
feeling of regret

2065
01:52:40,177 --> 01:52:42,419
"and a sense of
great personal loss

2066
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:45,644
"that for reasons of ill health,

2067
01:52:45,739 --> 01:52:48,521
"I submit to this board
my resignation

2068

01:52:51,302 --> 01:52:53,316

"Sincerely...

2071

Douglas N. Devanal, M.D."

2072
01:53:28,513 --> 01:53:31,294
We've covered a lot of ground,

2073
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:33,020
for two people
who have forgotten

2074
01:53:33,116 --> 01:53:35,514
how to talk to each other.

2075
01:53:38,007 --> 01:53:40,021
What do we do now?

2076
01:53:41,939 --> 01:53:44,625
Try to...
Help each other

2077
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:47,154
as much as we can.

2078
01:53:47,214 --> 01:53:49,612
Be as honest as we can.

2079
01:54:13,588 --> 01:54:15,602
Stevie!

2080
01:54:22,698 --> 01:54:25,384
I...Came back.

2081
01:54:27,014 --> 01:54:29,064
You all right?

2082
01:54:29,124 --> 01:54:32,193
Came back...
For an explanation.

2083
01:54:32,289 --> 01:54:33,192
Explanation?

2084
01:54:33,252 --> 01:54:35,102
Where the devil have you been?

2085
01:54:35,262 --> 01:54:36,928
Waiting here for hours.

2086
01:54:36,988 --> 01:54:39,098
Where have you been?

2087
01:54:39,194 --> 01:54:41,754
Do you realize everybody's
been looking for you,

2088
01:54:41,815 --> 01:54:43,546
been dragging the
river all night?

2089
01:54:43,606 --> 01:54:44,573
Too bad.

2090
01:54:44,669 --> 01:54:45,751
What do you mean?

2091
01:54:45,811 --> 01:54:47,058
They won't find me.

2092
01:54:47,154 --> 01:54:49,072
Mciver: They'll find you,
all right.

2093
01:54:49,168 --> 01:54:51,661
I'll throw you back in myself.

2094
01:54:55,018 --> 01:54:56,840
It's all right, it's all right.

2095
01:54:56,936 --> 01:54:59,621
Come on, Stevie,
you can make it.

2096
01:55:02,307 --> 01:55:04,932
I made it...
Didn't I?

2097
01:55:04,992 --> 01:55:06,371
That's right, Stevie.

2098
01:55:06,431 --> 01:55:08,732
You made it.

2099
01:55:16,596 --> 01:55:18,071
Oh, say...

2100
01:55:18,131 --> 01:55:19,797
could...could you
get hold of sue?

2101
01:55:19,857 --> 01:55:22,483
- Tell her I'm all right?
- Yeah, sure.

2102
01:55:22,543 --> 01:55:23,729
Explain to her?

2103
01:55:23,789 --> 01:55:25,551
She's got a lot of
anxieties, you know.

2104
01:55:25,611 --> 01:55:26,666
Yeah, I know, I know.

2105
01:55:26,762 --> 01:55:29,160
Tell her I still got her bell.

2106
01:55:29,256 --> 01:55:31,270
What's Dr. Carmody's
phone number?

2107
01:55:31,366 --> 01:55:33,284
It's in the book.

2108
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:35,585
Just...Thought I'd
lie down a minute.

2109
01:55:39,326 --> 01:55:41,723
You ever almost
drowned yourself?

2110
01:55:41,819 --> 01:55:43,354
No.

2111
01:55:43,450 --> 01:55:44,984
It's just silly.

2112
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:47,286
I'll never do it again.

2113
01:55:57,547 --> 01:55:59,274
Oh, hi.

2114
01:55:59,370 --> 01:56:01,671
Is he going to be all right?

2115
01:56:01,767 --> 01:56:02,762
Yeah, mark.

2116
01:56:02,822 --> 01:56:05,124
I think he's going to be fine.

2117
01:56:17,496 --> 01:56:20,181
You know, mark, uh...

2118
01:56:20,277 --> 01:56:22,806
Sometimes it's
easier for a doctor

2119
01:56:22,866 --> 01:56:25,168
to take care of his patients

2120
01:56:25,264 --> 01:56:28,045
than...Than someone of his own.

2121
01:56:28,141 --> 01:56:31,402
I know, dad.
That's your job.

2122
01:56:45,308 --> 01:56:47,418
Can I help you?

2123
01:56:48,856 --> 01:56:50,774
You have.

2124
01:57:28,944 --> 01:57:33,739
I seem to...Keep running
into these things.
