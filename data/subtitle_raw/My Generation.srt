Kim Byeong-seok

4
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,039
{y:i}I picked up a blue notebook.

5
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,293
{y:i}There were some funny-looking
{y:i}figures drawn in

6
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,172
{y:i}Some cool phrases, too.

7
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,678
{y:i}There's nothing I can't see.

8
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,014
{y:i}I'm blind.

9
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,685
{y:i}There is nothing.

10
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,605
{y:i}Then, what is there?

11
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,568
Yoo Jae-kyung

12
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,945
How long has it been since
you graduated?

13
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,657
About five years.

14
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,578
Never worked as an accountant?

15
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:45,290
No, after high school
I worked in an insurance company.

16
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,375
How long?

17
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,713
A little over a year.

18
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,968
Then you should know
about the job...

19
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,637
What's your father do?

20
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,056
You have a father, right?

21
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,267
Yes, he's just...

22
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,937
...works.

23
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,357
What kind of work?

24
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,736
Just... this and that.

25
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:21,993
We may not look it,

26
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,746
but since we deal with money,
we're picky about who we hire.

27
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,707
That's why I asked.

28
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,253
What kind of work is it?

29
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:39,469
Well, people who need money urgently...
we loan it to them.

30
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,222
Not like a loan shark or anything.

31
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,224
We just keep a cashbox.

32
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,644
And we collect some interest,
from people in an emergency.

33
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,957
Sorry. Hang on a second.

34
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,250
Okay.

35
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:18,341
If you're not busy,
I'll buy you dinner before you go.

36
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,009
Excuse me?

37
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,219
Let's have a dinner before you go.

38
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,887
Alright.

39
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,313
Who told you about us?

40
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,650
- In the newspaper...
- Yes, yes.

41
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:39,487
Well, you have a credit card, right?

42
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,995
Or a bank book... No, bring them both.

43
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,831
Bring whatever you have.

44
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:56,338
No, just an abstract
of your family register.

45
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:58,798
Yeah.

46
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,635
You told me to leave an hour early.

47
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,435
I'm just about there. Okay.

48
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,754
I told you to come on time!

49
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,881
I said I left early.

50
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,550
You could've taken a bus.

51
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,886
Do you know how heavy
this camera is?

52
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,889
Can't you live without a car?

53
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,727
Oh, it's gone.

54
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,165
Car Reclamation

55
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,589
How much was it?

56
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,267
Hey.

57
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,396
Should I sell the car?

58
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,488
You hate cleaning it anyway.

59
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,074
Not so much...

60
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,951
I just do it when I feel bored...

61
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,831
Can you live without it?
You who hates to walk.

62
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:04,799
There you go.

63
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,220
Turn it up...

64
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,434
The volume.

65
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,437
A little more.

66
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,774
- Huh?
- Yeah.

67
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,680
- Oh, it's you.
- Yeah.

68
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,391
Did you move the key?

69
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,897
Oh, you bastard.

70
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,302
How did you know I was coming?

71
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,139
I usually buy two.

72
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,059
You eat both of them?

73
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:09,317
One at dawn, when I get hungry.

74
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,158
Then what'll you do at dawn?

75
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,039
I'll just go to sleep early.

76
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,424
Hey, still awake?

77
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,385
Byeong-seok.

78
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,682
Aren't you going to sleep?

79
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:06,916
Here.

80
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,627
What is it?

81
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,882
Acanthopanax juice.
It's good stuff.

82
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,930
You're hungry, right? Drink it.

83
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:34,903
You're selling this stuff nowadays?

84
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,280
Yeah...

85
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,994
It sells well.

86
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,511
Are these all your deductions?

87
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,763
Yes, that's all.

88
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,059
Are you really working there?

89
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:10,063
Work? I quit my job a while back.

90
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,485
What use is a job you've already quit?
Look at this guy.

91
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,363
- One of my acquaintances said...
- Miss Yoo

92
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,073
Don't you have
anything cold?

93
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,911
One of my acquaintances
got about 3 million won...

94
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,329
and he said you were very nice.

95
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,455
Am I your cashbox or something?

96
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,875
You need to satisfy
some basic conditions.

97
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,754
I came by recommendation.
It's really urgent.

98
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,507
All Korea is like that.

99
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:43,096
You need some credit.
Think about it.

100
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:47,642
Who'll give you money
with all these overdue credit card bills?

101
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,229
It's really an emergency.

102
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,105
What is it?

103
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,443
I have a dog at home.

104
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:59,612
A mutt? A dog?

105
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,532
She needs to get a
Caesarean section.

106
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:04,534
This guy is unbelievable.

107
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,245
You want 3 million won for a dog?

108
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:10,540
She's long past her delivery date,
so she's in danger.

109
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,835
Anyway, let's go and see.

110
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,046
I'm in your hands.

111
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:17,714
Aren't you cold?

112
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,965
I'm alright.

113
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,576
- Miss Yoo!
- Yes?

114
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,706
Do you always look so depressed?

115
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,084
No.

116
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:01,299
I like people who look depressed.

117
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,220
I'll be back in a bit.

118
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,097
Okay.

119
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,587
Hello?

120
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,341
Who's speaking?

121
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:49,514
No, there's no one here
by that name.

122
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:54,769
This is a shop, a store.
You called the wrong number.

123
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,445
Who was that?

124
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,114
I don't know.
He was looking for you.

125
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:34,934
What's up with your neck?

126
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,896
Why's it bandaged?

127
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,065
I got burned.

128
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,532
You need to change that dressing.

129
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:55,205
Do I have time to care about that?

130
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:57,290
I'm OK.

131
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,546
Miss Yoo. Can you speak English?

132
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,090
Well, just a little.

133
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,345
I tried reading the original,
and it's giving me a headache.

134
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:39,768
What does "mute" mean?
"Mute". M, U, T, E.

135
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,520
Want me to look it up
on the internet?

136
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:48,651
No, I thought if you spoke English,
I could introduce you to anotherjob.

137
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:54,449
Working here's
nothing special, is it?

138
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:05,210
Miss Yoo.
Don't bother coming in anymore.

139
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,839
If you teach me, I can do a good job.

140
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,806
It's no use. I can't stand
people who look depressed.

141
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,768
Write down your
bank account number before going.

142
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,938
I'll pay you for today's work.

143
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,572
- You've been here?
- Yeah, when did you arrive?

144
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,365
I've been looking for you
all this time.

145
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:22,954
Go stay in the car. I'm almost done.

146
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:26,875
Go on.

147
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,459
Did you eat anything?

148
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:10,835
A while ago.

149
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,629
Aren't you hungry?

150
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,174
Let's go inside and eat something.

151
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,009
- Where?
- In the store.

152
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,843
How'd you get the key?

153
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,472
I thought you were just
making charcoal fires.

154
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,110
Are you cold?

155
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:29,664
Eat up.

156
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,193
Is there someone out there?

157
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,616
Doesn't it taste good?
Why aren't you eating?

158
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,383
Do I look depressed?

159
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,055
Eat one first.

160
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:39,567
The big one.

161
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:52,747
You don't look depressed anymore.

162
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:01,881
I got fired.

163
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:07,929
What's up?

164
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,765
It's not the first time, you know.

165
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,771
First time I was fired
on the first day, though.

166
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:21,901
Better to stay away
from that kind of place.

167
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,282
But I had to go.

168
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,011
I'm filming...

169
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:35,809
No.

170
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:41,606
You're still angry?
You want to cry, don't you?

171
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:48,780
What a shame.
I don't want to cry.

172
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:53,410
Did you buy the camera for this?

173
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:02,252
Is filming this kind of thing fun?

174
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,717
Why do you only ever think
from your own perspective?

175
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,706
{y:i}Songs of reeds...

176
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:30,465
{y:i}Mommy and my sister...
{y:i}let's Iive together.

177
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:32,842
One.....

178
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,265
two...

179
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:45,230
three...

180
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,110
four...

181
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:57,951
five...

182
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,034
What the hell are you filming?

183
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:46,207
When'll you give me the camera?

184
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,879
Don't ever film her again.

185
00:27:51,421 --> 00:27:52,756
Don't ever hit me again.

186
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,386
You can't film Silbee.
But for me, it's okay.

187
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,514
Her name's Silbee?

188
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:04,309
That name matches her looks, huh?

189
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,020
Is that a compliment or not?

190
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,731
It's sure not an insult.

191
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,525
Now you're gonna hit me again.

192
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:17,197
Bro, I'm an artist.

193
00:28:19,115 --> 00:28:20,075
I don't like violence.

194
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,243
What kind of art?

195
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:23,745
Painting.

196
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,038
- Painting...
- Jae-hun!

197
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:26,748
See you later.

198
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,008
I can't call you "bro," can I?

199
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:58,321
Is anyone there?

200
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:04,619
Anyone there?

201
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:12,627
Yes...

202
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:13,878
Are you Kim Byeong-seok?

203
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:14,504
Yes.

204
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:16,548
Why don't you answer
the damn phone?

205
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,091
I called your office
and nobody answered.

206
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:19,134
What do you mean, my office?

207
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:23,972
That makes no sense.

208
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:25,348
What makes no sense?

209
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:27,642
How can someone take out a loan
without telling me?

210
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:32,063
Look here. Samho Trading.
This is where you work.

211
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,815
I've never worked there.

212
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:35,191
Look at this.

213
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:38,194
You received money in
your bank account, from here.

214
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:44,409
Then do you know Kim Hyung-seok?
Who is he?

215
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:47,078
My elder brother.

216
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:47,996
Your brother?

217
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:56,713
Look, he co-signed this.
He signed and the loan was granted.

218
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,720
It says he works
for a credit association.

219
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:06,306
He has no job, either.

220
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:13,188
When was the last time
you contacted him?

221
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,525
Didn't he tell you about this?

222
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,005
Are you here to return something?

223
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:41,841
No, I was told
you're recruiting associates.

224
00:30:41,841 --> 00:30:45,345
Associates? Were you waiting long?
This way, please.

225
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:45,887
Yes...

226
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:54,896
All these products are made
for the winter season.

227
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:58,316
We operate a big factory in China.

228
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:00,694
We get all our products there,

229
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:03,488
and some are exported to Japan.

230
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:08,660
We export to Southeast Asia,
Japan and Hong Kong.

231
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:36,312
Have you seen everything?

232
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:37,022
Yes.

233
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:38,106
How was it? Is everything alright?

234
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:42,485
About our shopping mall,
we don'tjust handle clothes...

235
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:46,197
We handle everything from clothes
to general merchandise.

236
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,952
We have loads of products,
so a lot of customers visit.

237
00:31:52,037 --> 00:31:56,207
Our revenues are growing, and we're
recruiting people to start enterprises.

238
00:31:56,958 --> 00:32:00,587
At first, we take half the earnings.
Half for us and the other half for you.

239
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:04,424
The more products you sell,
the more you get.

240
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:07,344
I hope you can join us...?

241
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:24,546
Why didn't you call me
before their eyes opened?

242
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:29,175
I tried, but when I came in,
they'd opened them already.

243
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:31,553
Cute, huh?

244
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,893
You still do
a lot of those wedding jobs?

245
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:41,187
A bit.

246
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,942
How can you have so much free time?

247
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:49,320
I'm not photographing because I'm free.

248
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:52,365
I just want to add them to my works.

249
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:57,162
Works? You really do have free time.

250
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:06,296
Don't do that, help me out instead.

251
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:47,128
Hey, I don't think
we'll sell anything here.

252
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:49,756
Quiet, I'm writing a diary.

253
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:51,675
I'm cold.

254
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:55,762
Shut up, shithead!
You need to learn about hardship.

255
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:16,658
You weren't sleeping?

256
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:18,785
I don't go to sleep this early.

257
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:06,833
You want me to get out?
Are you going home?

258
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:18,511
Why don't you come to my home?

259
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:22,599
Is no one there?

260
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:29,814
Let's go there and eat something

261
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:40,575
This isn't our garden.

262
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:54,589
You said you were hungry?

263
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,592
But what good is this?

264
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:04,933
What are you doing?

265
00:37:06,226 --> 00:37:08,353
Wait. One's gonna fall down.

266
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:10,438
Are you an idiot?

267
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:13,149
Didn't you know that?

268
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:16,194
Just pick one.

269
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:18,446
No, it's gonna fall, I tell you.

270
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:24,953
Say, "pear, pear, pear..."

271
00:37:37,215 --> 00:37:38,967
Pear, pear, pear

272
00:38:30,268 --> 00:38:31,811
Why'd you beat him?

273
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,822
In jail now.

274
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:54,501
- Are you playing this game?
- Yes.

275
00:38:57,295 --> 00:38:58,338
You are playing?

276
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:20,068
Why don't you answer the phone?

277
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:29,619
What if it's an emergency?

278
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:31,955
I don't care.

279
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:48,138
Byeong-seok.

280
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:51,433
Don't do anything bad.

281
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,896
Let's live honestly.

282
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:33,516
Do you have some money?

283
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:35,894
How did you find me here?

284
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:39,856
I followed you home last time.

285
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:41,775
You followed me? Why?

286
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:44,819
I thought it might be helpful someday.

287
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:47,030
Come in, anyway.

288
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:58,500
Silbee doesn't like her remarried father
or her divorced mother.

289
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:01,795
So she lives alone.

290
00:41:05,215 --> 00:41:07,342
But why are you trying
to get money for Silbee?

291
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:13,390
Have you...

292
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:19,354
ever been dumped?

293
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:24,943
Surely. By a lot of people.

294
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:30,615
Not by a person. By money.

295
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:36,538
So many times for me.

296
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:45,463
But Silbee never has.

297
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:57,142
Bro, I need to ask a difficult favor.

298
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,064
Well, I really need some money.

299
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:05,900
A lot.

300
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:15,243
Yes, a lot.

301
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:23,877
I need about 3,800,000 won. Yes.

302
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:35,597
Well, I have a bank account number.

303
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:42,062
Yes, bro? Thanks. Yes.

304
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:46,107
I'll talk to you later.

305
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:18,348
Is there anything
you need to buy these days?

306
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:23,311
Any items you need to get?

307
00:43:27,023 --> 00:43:32,362
Well, there's a website I know.
How about buying something there?

308
00:43:36,616 --> 00:43:38,702
No, I'm not working there.

309
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:57,470
No, thanks.
I'll call you later.

310
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:08,648
He promised to
lend me some money.

311
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:11,651
But he isn't answering the phone.

312
00:44:20,535 --> 00:44:21,870
I will try to call again.

313
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:30,879
Who do you keep calling?

314
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:38,928
Is it good?

315
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:40,930
Yeah, it's good.

316
00:44:55,945 --> 00:44:57,530
Is there anything
you're not telling me?

317
00:45:18,134 --> 00:45:19,135
Nothing?

318
00:45:29,145 --> 00:45:30,689
Did your mother use the credit card?

319
00:45:33,024 --> 00:45:35,151
- My mother?
- Yes, your mother.

320
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:37,946
No, why?

321
00:45:39,531 --> 00:45:42,075
The credit card statement says
something was bought in installments.

322
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:46,830
It was for 1,300,000 won.

323
00:45:56,965 --> 00:46:05,473
You didn't really join
what you told me about, did you?

324
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:07,308
Eat first.

325
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:09,102
Is that it?

326
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:10,478
I told you, eat first.

327
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:16,818
Hey, I told you not to sign up.

328
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:22,574
Why should you pay money
to sell other people's stuff?

329
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:30,457
I told you they're swindlers.

330
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:37,797
Did you sign up?

331
00:46:45,221 --> 00:46:46,181
Hey!

332
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:57,650
Did you give them 1 ,300,000 won?

333
00:47:01,821 --> 00:47:03,573
How are you going to make it up?

334
00:47:04,866 --> 00:47:06,368
I can make money.

335
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:12,332
How? Selling rice bags to your friends?

336
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:15,210
Don't worry.
I can make up for my debt.

337
00:47:16,878 --> 00:47:18,838
How come it's your debt?
It's our debt.

338
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:24,302
Our debt? Then why do you pay
my credit card bills?

339
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:28,598
Because...I bought
my camera with it.

340
00:47:28,932 --> 00:47:30,350
Of course I should pay.

341
00:47:31,768 --> 00:47:32,644
Is that all?

342
00:47:35,313 --> 00:47:40,068
What about the food, drink, motel bills?
They're our debts, too.

343
00:47:40,694 --> 00:47:43,071
I'm telling you,
I'll pay my share among them.

344
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:15,645
Mister!

345
00:48:19,733 --> 00:48:20,734
Mister!

346
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:27,240
- Mister!
- Yeah

347
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:30,243
Can I borrow some charcoal?

348
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:38,460
What do you need them for?

349
00:48:40,545 --> 00:48:42,005
Or will you sell it?

350
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:58,730
Hey, how should I do this?

351
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:01,126
Who are you?

352
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:02,961
Nice to see you.

353
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:05,588
What the hell are you doing?

354
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:08,091
Drink some water.

355
00:50:11,803 --> 00:50:14,431
Fucker, you've never seen
someone water the garden?

356
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:17,058
Where's your brother?

357
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:43,084
You keep filming people crying.

358
00:50:43,877 --> 00:50:45,879
Hey, look.

359
00:50:46,379 --> 00:50:47,839
Hey, look.

360
00:50:49,132 --> 00:50:51,593
Why are you doing this?

361
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,806
You feel sad if
one more Korean virgin is gone?

362
00:50:58,516 --> 00:51:02,479
If you keep doing this,
it'll be really hard on me.

363
00:51:02,562 --> 00:51:03,563
Just give me the money.

364
00:51:03,646 --> 00:51:04,939
Just shut up about the money.

365
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:08,318
Look, you don't shoot anything useful.

366
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,695
How can you come
and ask for money?

367
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:13,531
You feel good when I pay you...

368
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:15,950
Feel like you're rich, huh?

369
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:21,831
What the...?

370
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:25,669
You only filmed
her mother crying this time.

371
00:51:29,255 --> 00:51:32,801
And what's with your camera work?
Zigzagging like a music video.

372
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:42,435
I told you last time.
Just make an effort.

373
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:45,605
Let's work together in earnest.

374
00:51:48,733 --> 00:51:49,609
You're bad off these days, huh?

375
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:52,946
You bought that camera
with your credit card?

376
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:54,572
And you still haven't paid it off?

377
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:46,750
Hello?

378
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:48,877
Why?

379
00:52:57,927 --> 00:53:01,639
What are you talking about?
There were worms in that rice?

380
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:08,188
They said that they design those clothes.

381
00:53:17,072 --> 00:53:18,698
What, aren't they answering the phone?

382
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:36,091
Okay, I'll return them.
They said it's no problem to return it.

383
00:53:47,977 --> 00:53:49,771
How could you say that?

384
00:53:49,979 --> 00:53:52,649
How much do you think I earn selling it?

385
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:14,129
Yeah, that'll make me rich.
I'll be rich selling that stuff to you.

386
00:54:20,343 --> 00:54:23,263
I'll be rich and happy
all on my own.

387
00:54:39,529 --> 00:54:41,740
Why do you get angry over it?

388
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:30,955
Oh, there you are.

389
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:36,920
Did you move the key again?

390
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:39,673
No key over there.

391
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,341
What?

392
00:55:44,803 --> 00:55:46,221
Let's get inside...it's freezing.

393
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:04,572
Where did you spend the money
loaned on my name?

394
00:56:18,712 --> 00:56:20,422
Where did you spend the money
you loaned?

395
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:17,580
Hey.

396
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:21,960
I want to hit you just once.

397
00:59:18,558 --> 00:59:19,768
Are we brothers?

398
00:59:23,813 --> 00:59:24,773
Are we really?

399
00:59:26,858 --> 00:59:30,278
Oh, fuck.

400
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:44,751
Hey, hit me.

401
00:59:49,172 --> 00:59:50,924
Hit me now. dammit!

402
00:59:50,924 --> 00:59:51,925
Hit me now.

403
00:59:53,718 --> 00:59:55,762
Please hit me one time.

404
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:06,606
Please. Oh, shit!

405
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:07,417
Hey.

406
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:26,019
You know me, right? Who am I?

407
01:01:26,644 --> 01:01:27,270
My brother.

408
01:01:28,813 --> 01:01:30,106
How do you remember me?

409
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:33,276
I saw you once at home.

410
01:01:34,444 --> 01:01:38,073
You're already grown up.
Where are you coming from?

411
01:01:38,656 --> 01:01:39,616
From a study institute.

412
01:01:41,993 --> 01:01:43,203
Is father home?

413
01:01:46,498 --> 01:01:47,707
Is he treating you well?

414
01:01:50,293 --> 01:01:52,087
Stop nodding, say something.

415
01:01:54,297 --> 01:01:55,924
Yes he does.

416
01:01:59,552 --> 01:02:02,347
He should. He is a good man.

417
01:02:06,267 --> 01:02:09,396
Go, he should be
waiting for you at home.

418
01:02:18,571 --> 01:02:19,406
Yohan!

419
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:34,295
Don't use formal speech next time.
Brothers don't need to.

420
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:38,258
I told you, say it.

421
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,343
OK.

422
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:43,722
Go on.

423
01:03:23,678 --> 01:03:25,013
Hello?

424
01:03:26,848 --> 01:03:32,354
I'm Yoo Jae-kyoung,
who used to work there briefly.

425
01:03:34,439 --> 01:03:36,358
Do you remember me?

426
01:03:41,571 --> 01:03:45,033
I'm right outside the office.

427
01:03:46,368 --> 01:03:47,869
Where are you?

428
01:03:55,418 --> 01:03:56,753
Oh, come in.

429
01:04:00,256 --> 01:04:01,675
Have a candy.

430
01:04:07,931 --> 01:04:10,266
Why didn't you tell me
you were here?

431
01:04:16,064 --> 01:04:17,148
What are you doing nowadays?

432
01:04:18,441 --> 01:04:19,609
Still doing nothing?

433
01:04:22,696 --> 01:04:25,532
I told you to study English.

434
01:04:31,746 --> 01:04:33,289
You still look depressed.

435
01:04:40,338 --> 01:04:43,216
Did I pay you for the one day's work?

436
01:04:45,927 --> 01:04:46,845
I didn't?

437
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:51,433
You should have just told me.
No need to come here, just call.

438
01:04:56,730 --> 01:04:58,064
That's why you're here.

439
01:04:58,064 --> 01:05:02,235
Here, take this.

440
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:03,778
I'm sorry to pay you so late.

441
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,619
Take it.

442
01:05:16,499 --> 01:05:20,170
Actually it wasn't this,
I just need money.

443
01:05:20,337 --> 01:05:20,837
Money?

444
01:05:21,963 --> 01:05:22,589
How much?

445
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:26,092
About 3 million won.

446
01:05:26,217 --> 01:05:27,052
3 million?

447
01:05:28,261 --> 01:05:29,804
Please lend me money
with the credit card.

448
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,850
You're really funny...

449
01:05:35,518 --> 01:05:36,478
Go on.

450
01:05:40,857 --> 01:05:41,941
Keep talking.

451
01:05:46,488 --> 01:05:48,615
Hey, just take this instead.

452
01:05:51,993 --> 01:05:54,621
Do you think money's
like a piece of candy?

453
01:06:03,421 --> 01:06:04,714
Take it.

454
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:07,384
Can't you do this for me?

455
01:06:07,592 --> 01:06:08,760
No, I can't.

456
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:11,721
I have an urgent reason...

457
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:13,515
Is there anyone who doesn't
have a reason?

458
01:06:14,724 --> 01:06:16,935
Everyone who needs money
has a reason.

459
01:06:19,187 --> 01:06:20,772
Don't you know
this is not a good thing?

460
01:06:23,316 --> 01:06:24,317
You're still young.

461
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:34,786
- I know, but you...
- You know, the...

462
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,418
What's your phone number?

463
01:06:41,418 --> 01:06:45,505
Tell me, your home telephone.

464
01:06:47,507 --> 01:06:48,675
Do your parents know about this?

465
01:06:52,053 --> 01:06:53,888
I doubt it.

466
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,452
Excuse me, is that a camera case?

467
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:17,328
Are you the one who called me?

468
01:07:19,622 --> 01:07:20,582
No.

469
01:07:37,474 --> 01:07:39,267
Uh...is this expensive?

470
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:40,185
Yes.

471
01:08:19,015 --> 01:08:21,643
Here you are.

472
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:33,488
Uh...can I see that camera
just for second?

473
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:49,212
Can I see it just for a second?

474
01:08:58,805 --> 01:09:00,598
Where is the switch?

475
01:09:19,909 --> 01:09:21,745
Wow, it's nice.

476
01:09:32,464 --> 01:09:38,595
Uh...in fact today's my last day,
so I want to make a souvenir.

477
01:09:38,595 --> 01:09:41,973
Could you film me?

478
01:09:44,225 --> 01:09:48,438
I don't like coffee...
Can you get me a cup of cocoa?

479
01:09:48,563 --> 01:09:49,397
Cocoa?

480
01:09:49,397 --> 01:09:53,651
Yes, cocoa.

481
01:10:17,384 --> 01:10:19,969
Oh, hello.

482
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:48,915
- You wanted to sell a camera?
- Are you the one who called me?

483
01:10:51,209 --> 01:10:52,794
I had a hard time
reaching you on the phone.

484
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:56,631
I got cocoa for you...

485
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:03,263
Even just 100,000 won...
Is that okay?

486
01:11:04,806 --> 01:11:07,559
If you discountjust 100,000 won,
I can afford it.

487
01:11:07,976 --> 01:11:10,645
Orjust 50,000...You can't?

488
01:11:12,147 --> 01:11:14,065
It's not that bad, is it?

489
01:11:14,607 --> 01:11:16,109
If you can't do that for me, then.....

490
01:11:49,768 --> 01:11:51,353
Lady, you called, right?

491
01:11:51,436 --> 01:11:52,103
Yes.

492
01:11:52,228 --> 01:11:54,939
Let's go... Who told you about us?

493
01:11:54,939 --> 01:11:55,899
Mr. Ahn.

494
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:57,942
Mr. Ahn? Let's go.

495
01:12:15,835 --> 01:12:17,629
How much did you tell us?

496
01:12:17,712 --> 01:12:18,546
Three million.

497
01:12:18,546 --> 01:12:19,422
Three million.

498
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:23,176
And which card?

499
01:12:23,927 --> 01:12:24,886
BC.

500
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:31,309
BC...I'm not sure
if we can do this with BC card.

501
01:12:36,147 --> 01:12:37,232
Hey, did you work on BC card?

502
01:12:37,565 --> 01:12:38,983
They said they would
finish it by this morning.

503
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:40,735
- Get up there.
- OK

504
01:13:04,592 --> 01:13:05,927
Hold on for a second.

505
01:14:42,148 --> 01:14:43,858
A Jeweler's Shop

506
01:14:44,109 --> 01:14:45,068
Go and buy it...

507
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:53,660
Go up there and ask them
to give you gold with that card.

508
01:14:53,702 --> 01:14:54,619
Gold?

509
01:14:55,203 --> 01:14:57,831
Yeah...Just go up there and
tell them to give you gold...

510
01:14:59,374 --> 01:15:00,875
and they will work on it.

511
01:15:06,339 --> 01:15:09,801
Go up there and say it.
Just say "give me gold."

512
01:15:14,556 --> 01:15:15,557
With a card?

513
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:16,599
It's okay...

514
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:18,018
Do you want to do it by installments?

515
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:18,768
Yes.

516
01:15:18,935 --> 01:15:19,728
How many months?

517
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:21,980
Twelve.

518
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:23,356
Okay.

519
01:15:53,303 --> 01:15:54,095
Did you buy it?

520
01:15:54,596 --> 01:15:55,638
Yes.

521
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:57,640
Let's go.

522
01:16:10,737 --> 01:16:11,279
Gold...

523
01:16:13,365 --> 01:16:14,115
Give me that gold.

524
01:16:18,828 --> 01:16:22,332
We don't do that kind of
illegal thing.

525
01:16:22,707 --> 01:16:23,958
We do it according
to interest rates.

526
01:16:24,876 --> 01:16:27,712
It's 6.8 percent today.

527
01:16:29,756 --> 01:16:31,966
I get 216,000
and give you the rest.

528
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:34,094
Let's go.

529
01:16:43,728 --> 01:16:44,479
Come here.

530
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:59,327
Here's a million won. Take it.

531
01:17:00,912 --> 01:17:01,955
Two million...

532
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:15,719
And 760,000. Count it.

533
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:24,811
Oh, I still have 6,000 to give you...

534
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:28,148
Here you are.

535
01:17:30,692 --> 01:17:34,654
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

536
01:17:36,865 --> 01:17:40,368
Secure it. It's dangerous.

537
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:45,165
Go ahead. You go first.

538
01:17:45,665 --> 01:17:46,666
Goodbye.

539
01:17:46,666 --> 01:17:47,417
Bye.

540
01:19:22,262 --> 01:19:24,723
Hey, did you go somewhere?

541
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:39,487
Why didn't you get undressed?
What are you doing? Hey!

542
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,979
Do you want to drive it?

543
01:20:37,128 --> 01:20:38,171
Push this for a second.

544
01:20:46,971 --> 01:20:48,515
Where did you get money?

545
01:20:48,765 --> 01:20:49,766
What money?

546
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:53,687
I saw your
credit card bill's already paid.

547
01:20:56,648 --> 01:20:57,857
I just got some.

548
01:21:08,576 --> 01:21:10,203
I sold my camera.

549
01:21:14,749 --> 01:21:16,084
What's this then?

550
01:21:18,461 --> 01:21:19,462
A camera.

551
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:33,768
You're kidding, right?

552
01:21:47,365 --> 01:21:49,075
I still have 100,000 won to be paid.

553
01:21:50,827 --> 01:21:52,704
I'm only holding it for today.

554
01:22:38,583 --> 01:22:41,920
Hey, is that fun?

555
01:22:45,882 --> 01:22:47,509
What are you doing?

556
01:22:49,177 --> 01:22:50,512
I asked you if it's fun.

557
01:22:54,516 --> 01:22:56,101
You're so bad at driving.

558
01:23:04,025 --> 01:23:05,276
Did you stay home today?

559
01:23:10,824 --> 01:23:12,033
What did you do at home?

560
01:23:19,833 --> 01:23:21,126
Just rolling about, right?

561
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:30,260
You're driving without looking?

562
01:23:36,224 --> 01:23:37,225
You don't want to say?

563
01:23:50,280 --> 01:23:51,239
You don't want to say?

564
01:24:06,713 --> 01:24:08,465
I'll tell you
if you turn off that camera.
