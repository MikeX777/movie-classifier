1
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,461
My man's a boxer.

2
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,462
You're going to get me beat up.

3
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:20,365
Sit down, girl.

4
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,407
She's scared of getting beat up.

5
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:24,903
It's going to start soon.

6
00:01:27,937 --> 00:01:29,814
Let's play!

7
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,087
People want music.
We'll play and then we'll leave.

8
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,355
Why is there no music today?

9
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:40,353
Fuel…

10
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,923
No, no. Stan.

11
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:42,961
Start!

12
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:54,366
Good evening.

13
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,868
How are you?
- Fine.

14
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:22,930
I like it when you all drink.

15
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,496
You all have to drink, like me.

16
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:27,931
Wait.

17
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:29,901
Are you an intern here?

18
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:36,983
Shiny

19
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,885
Graduate

20
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,287
Hands off.

21
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,323
Watch out, OK.

22
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:47,088
Give me four skewers.

23
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,961
I am Tabu!

24
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,325
Tabu Fatu!

25
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:03,842
Hang on.

26
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,307
Thanks to you I'm going to drink and eat.

27
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:08,312
Stop it, I'm working.

28
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:12,180
Bring me my feeding bottle!

29
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:39,914
He's already drunk!

30
00:03:42,872 --> 00:03:45,113
He's well over his limit.

31
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,141
Sing, mama. Sing.

32
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:44,742
Yesterday, I met a woman.

33
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:47,009
Like nothing you've ever seen!

34
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,915
Imagine a mix of wonders!

35
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:52,753
The mountains,

36
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:55,214
the lakes, the trees,

37
00:04:55,445 --> 00:04:58,324
vegetables, spices, salt.

38
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,793
It's killing me!

39
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:07,796
If a man loves you,
love yourself.

40
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:11,969
God needs only the soul.

41
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:13,970
The body will rot.

42
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,209
We're in the middle of a battle.

43
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,375
Stop lying.

44
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:22,208
So, what would you think
of this diamond ring?

45
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,908
You've hooked your prey.

46
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:28,186
Even night has two sides.

47
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:30,119
So does your mama.

48
00:05:47,397 --> 00:05:48,307
You're drunk.

49
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,142
Go home!
- Who do you take me for?

50
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,243
Get out!

51
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:55,148
Wait. It's coming!

52
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,280
A terrible rape!

53
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,853
Children kill. Even small kids.

54
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,647
Never!
You're arguing over false issues!

55
00:06:03,913 --> 00:06:06,655
People don't speak their minds.
Who knows what they think?

56
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:41,347
Whoever dares!

57
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,082
I'll send him back up his mother's ass!

58
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:46,722
His whore of a mother!

59
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,056
What are you A terrible?

60
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:54,960
Who do you think you are?

61
00:07:57,093 --> 00:07:58,663
Calm down, calm down…

62
00:08:00,997 --> 00:08:01,839
Hit him!

63
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,169
How dare you?
You're paying for this.

64
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,903
Leave him…

65
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,781
He went too far!

66
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:12,845
Leave him, leave him.

67
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,689
Tabu, Tabu?

68
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,674
Bandit?

69
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,683
Go find me someone to mend my fridge.

70
00:11:32,141 --> 00:11:33,211
Bandit?

71
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:34,449
Bandit!

72
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,723
Where's the repair man?
- There is no-one else.

73
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:41,122
What are you doing here?
- You're the one who called for me.

74
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,096
Come in.

75
00:11:45,354 --> 00:11:46,298
You mend fridges?

76
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:49,095
Has it got a motor?

77
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,504
It's the fan.

78
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,072
What do you mean, the fan?

79
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:33,246
Not even two weeks.

80
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:37,077
I paid 60000 francs
to buy a motor.

81
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:39,185
Your colleague said it was the motor.

82
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:41,415
60000 francs,
less than two weeks ago!

83
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:43,087
And now you say it's the fan!

84
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:45,350
First, he's not my colleague.

85
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,890
Second, it's not his fault,
this time, it's the fan.

86
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:51,796
Your sure it's a problem with the fan?

87
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:52,761
Sure?

88
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:58,335
I shouldn't have listened to that crook.

89
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:03,443
I wanted to get a new fridge,
but he told me not to.

90
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:06,370
To wait for him
to come back and mend it.

91
00:13:07,403 --> 00:13:08,814
How much for the fan?

92
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:10,982
Give me 30000 francs
plus my work.

93
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:12,479
How much?

94
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:13,718
30000 francs?

95
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,148
That's $100
for an old machine I…

96
00:13:16,312 --> 00:13:18,849
OK!
I'll buy a new one for you.

97
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:20,120
A new one?

98
00:13:20,516 --> 00:13:22,723
Give me $250
and I'll get you a new fridge.

99
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:24,889
I can't.
I can give you 100.

100
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:28,063
Give me 150.

101
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:31,236
I give you 150
and you bring me a new fridge?

102
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:33,705
Give me 150.
I'll find a good one.

103
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:41,847
The other guy told me the same thing.
The liar.

104
00:13:42,972 --> 00:13:44,918
I should never have listened to him.

105
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,912
You repair men, all crooks!

106
00:13:48,677 --> 00:13:52,022
He lied about the motor,
when it was something else.

107
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:55,089
It's my own fault. Too gullible.

108
00:13:57,453 --> 00:14:00,366
Do this, don't do that.
Do that? That's not right.

109
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,894
What am I going to do?

110
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:16,339
I'm going to go bankrupt.

111
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:19,243
My hard-earned money…

112
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:23,045
Just give it to him…

113
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:27,293
Find me a robust fridge.

114
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:29,418
A good one.

115
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:33,165
Not like this one.

116
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:36,097
Let it be strong!

117
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:38,098
DRC!

118
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,228
Hello?

119
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:07,690
Yes, it's me.

120
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:13,429
The hospital?

121
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:16,841
He's my son.

122
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:09,681
Papa.
- Yes, mama.

123
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:11,915
I got a call, my child was in an accident.

124
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:12,990
At what time?

125
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:15,185
I don't know. They just called me.

126
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,852
Go that way.

127
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:43,349
Mama!

128
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,848
I'm looking for Samo.
- Samo?

129
00:17:46,014 --> 00:17:47,857
I got a call.
- Which pavilion?

130
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,361
11.
- 11? I'll show you.

131
00:17:53,388 --> 00:17:56,733
Pavilion 11
When you get to that corner,

132
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,663
go all the way to the end.
They'll tell you where pavilion 11 is.

133
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:16,015
Mama, where is 11?
- 11 is just there.

134
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:18,248
Samo.

135
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:30,388
Calm down, dear.

136
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:32,689
The nurse is there.

137
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:34,895
She's there.

138
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:39,305
Nurse!

139
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:42,902
Yes?

140
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,305
You've got to move him.
He can't stay like that.

141
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,669
Who?
- My son. What happened to him?

142
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:49,007
It was a road accident.

143
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:50,942
An accident?
But how did it happen?

144
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:52,617
Motorbike, I think.

145
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,880
A motorbike accident, this bad?
- Calm down, mama.

146
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:58,791
Wait for the doctor, we'll know more.

147
00:19:58,981 --> 00:20:00,255
Who brought him here?
When?

148
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:03,225
The police…
- And they left him in that state?

149
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:04,658
We'll look after him.

150
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:09,225
He's got to go to another room.
He can't stay here like this!

151
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:11,665
We'll move him, but it'll cost more.

152
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,668
I'll pay!
- Not now.

153
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:15,735
Calm down.

154
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,342
Wait for the doctor,
he'll sort everything out.

155
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,441
Listen to me, calm down.

156
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,380
Let's wait for the doctor.

157
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,311
Mama, give me two loaves.

158
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:54,303
Hurry, please.

159
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,428
What's the problem? I've just got here.

160
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:18,064
Listen to me first.

161
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:21,399
His left leg is broken.

162
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,974
It's an open fracture
and there's a lot of bleeding.

163
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:28,915
But we can mend it.

164
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,846
What's needed?

165
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:33,451
He needs an operation.
- Then operate him.

166
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,854
It will cost you a lot of money.

167
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,885
I work.

168
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:40,952
Money isn't a problem.

169
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:43,185
Tell me how much it's going to cost.

170
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:48,168
For the operation,
it's 600 to 700000 Congolese francs.

171
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:51,104
But it's not just the operation.

172
00:21:51,293 --> 00:21:53,933
He'll need more care and treatment.

173
00:21:54,096 --> 00:21:57,009
In all it will cost

174
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,702
one million Congolese francs.
- Operate, papa!

175
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:01,676
Do it!
- Yes, yes…

176
00:22:02,337 --> 00:22:05,079
But first we need pan payment.

177
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,683
As soon as you've paid,

178
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:09,151
we will start with the operation.

179
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:13,089
But first you should buy
the necessary medicines.

180
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:16,156
What medicines must I buy?
I don't know.

181
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:17,830
I've prepared a prescription.

182
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,000
See the nurse.

183
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:25,699
Does the nurse…?

184
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:28,068
Go that way.
You'll find her in her office.

185
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,707
That way?
- Yes, that way.

186
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:55,024
My child.

187
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:57,133
My child.

188
00:23:00,095 --> 00:23:01,904
I'm going to the pharmacy.

189
00:23:03,198 --> 00:23:05,075
Give me your prescription.

190
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:06,835
So that I can help you.

191
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,249
You're exhausted.

192
00:23:15,777 --> 00:23:16,482
Mama.

193
00:23:17,045 --> 00:23:18,251
Leave it.

194
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:19,890
How will you pay?

195
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:42,207
Drink some water.

196
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,849
Do you want to eat?

197
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:57,094
Shall I give you some food?

198
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,893
Do you want some water?

199
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:14,133
Mama, are you asleep?

200
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,005
Should we take him to another room?

201
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:22,347
Yes.

202
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,349
Did you buy the medicines?

203
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:26,377
Yes.

204
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:32,923
Where is the woman who was here?

205
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:35,685
I don't know. Do you know her?

206
00:25:36,017 --> 00:25:37,223
Did you give her money?

207
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,629
Papa?

208
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:41,861
Where is the woman who was there?
- I don't know her.

209
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:43,764
Your wife, she was sitting there.

210
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,267
I don't know her.

211
00:25:46,027 --> 00:25:47,665
Why did you do that?

212
00:25:51,233 --> 00:25:53,736
You still want us
to take him to another room?

213
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:56,074
Leave it. You'll pay the cashier.

214
00:25:57,906 --> 00:26:00,352
Buy the medicine.
He needs it.

215
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:01,684
Change his room.

216
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:03,948
Papa, come and help.

217
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:05,748
We'll put him over there.

218
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,227
Don't drink too much tonight.

219
00:27:52,654 --> 00:27:55,134
I want your instrument to work.

220
00:28:12,874 --> 00:28:14,148
Give me your hat.

221
00:28:14,876 --> 00:28:16,321
Give me your hat.

222
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:21,085
Hey! What's up with you?

223
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:23,260
Take the hat and come with me.

224
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:37,270
Have you seen our singer?

225
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,052
Her son needs an operation.

226
00:28:48,243 --> 00:28:49,688
She's looking for money.

227
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:52,688
He's collecting donations,
little by little.

228
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,621
Whatever is left, you can give it to her.

229
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:37,286
There!

230
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,023
Like that!

231
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:40,887
You 're crazy!

232
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:42,726
I'm happy!

233
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:44,362
You're like lightning!

234
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,923
You sorcerer!

235
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:47,365
Pay me!

236
00:31:47,922 --> 00:31:48,992
And keep owing me!

237
00:31:49,457 --> 00:31:50,663
Like that!

238
00:31:50,925 --> 00:31:51,960
Thank you!

239
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:59,303
We've been summoned.

240
00:32:02,737 --> 00:32:03,977
I was told

241
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:06,875
that

242
00:32:07,475 --> 00:32:08,419
our colleague,

243
00:32:10,411 --> 00:32:12,948
Félicité… her son,

244
00:32:13,214 --> 00:32:15,490
had a terrible accident.

245
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:20,729
So, I ask you,
without forcing anyone,

246
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:24,932
to find it in your heart to help her.

247
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,740
Well, we all have our problems.

248
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:33,810
And if we all come here with them,
none of us will eat.

249
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:36,239
We all contribute for funerals.

250
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:39,451
But, by the grace of God,
the child is still alive.

251
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,787
I don't want it said
that it was me who refused.

252
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:46,054
I just want everyone to be aware
of what is being asked.

253
00:32:47,415 --> 00:32:49,952
Let each person give
what they are able to.

254
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,961
But do not put me
in judgment before God.

255
00:32:54,355 --> 00:32:55,197
That's not right.

256
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:57,664
I never ask.

257
00:32:58,292 --> 00:32:59,202
Mama…

258
00:33:00,795 --> 00:33:03,071
"If you lack money, have friends".

259
00:33:04,298 --> 00:33:08,269
Dieudo has spoken well, but…

260
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:11,210
Félicité is right too.

261
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:14,848
She hadn't asked for anything.

262
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,418
What we've been told is upsetting.

263
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,250
It has provoked much argument.

264
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:24,963
But we must help her.

265
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,301
OK, so, let he who has a little money

266
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:32,629
and the heart to give,

267
00:33:34,128 --> 00:33:35,198
give something.

268
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:39,210
God will return it to you.

269
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:42,140
Even if Félicité is like she is,

270
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,911
she was created this way,

271
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:48,151
but everybody changes.

272
00:35:50,865 --> 00:35:51,900
How did you get in?

273
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:54,738
Marry me, mama,

274
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:56,915
your life will improve.

275
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,018
If you forget me,

276
00:36:09,016 --> 00:36:11,292
I will strangle your little neck.

277
00:36:17,692 --> 00:36:19,330
You are tiny to me.

278
00:36:22,396 --> 00:36:23,898
Félicité…

279
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:26,406
You are beautiful.

280
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:29,781
Like the leaves of brambles.

281
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:31,345
When they laugh,

282
00:36:31,505 --> 00:36:33,712
nobody sees them.

283
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:36,821
Félicité…

284
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:40,091
Look at me
and let your heart quiver.

285
00:36:40,648 --> 00:36:42,628
You are beautiful, mama.

286
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:44,826
Like the leaves of brambles.

287
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:49,897
When they laugh,
nobody sees them.

288
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:52,329
Like when you laugh.

289
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,437
Do you want someone to take you?

290
00:37:00,768 --> 00:37:02,645
Who? You?

291
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:03,980
No.

292
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:06,710
How much will I have to pay?

293
00:37:06,908 --> 00:37:07,909
Just the petrol.

294
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:14,417
When you're done,
leave the keys at the shop.

295
00:39:49,336 --> 00:39:51,373
Is it you or someone else?

296
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:55,112
How did you let yourself go like this?

297
00:39:55,276 --> 00:39:57,256
You used to be a presentable woman.

298
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,923
Your mother used to tell me…

299
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:07,630
That she was
always worried for you.

300
00:40:08,355 --> 00:40:09,698
I told her:

301
00:40:09,857 --> 00:40:11,359
"Your daughter is brave."

302
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,171
She answered:

303
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,066
"She is too tough for her own good".

304
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,869
How did you end up this ugly?

305
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:27,916
I need your help.

306
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:32,352
You were dead, you know?

307
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,156
You were only one or two years old.

308
00:40:37,218 --> 00:40:37,923
You died.

309
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:40,732
You became very ill and died.

310
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,366
We put you in a coffin.

311
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:47,396
The priests were called for the burial.

312
00:40:48,062 --> 00:40:49,336
And then you woke up.

313
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:52,870
That's why we changed your name.

314
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,273
Your name was Kapinga.

315
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,844
We rechristened you Félicité,
"Our Joy".

316
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:02,181
We never told you

317
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:05,090
so that you wouldn't leave again.

318
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:17,093
Nobody will help me.

319
00:41:20,361 --> 00:41:22,102
You've come at the wrong time.

320
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:24,938
I have nothing.

321
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:30,745
Give me what you can.

322
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,010
Papa, I've come for my money.

323
00:42:08,175 --> 00:42:11,782
How about a "Hello" first!
- Hello, I've come for what you owe me.

324
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:14,959
This is a bad time.
- I don't have any time.

325
00:42:15,249 --> 00:42:16,728
Are you going to pay me or not?

326
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,760
You know the situation.

327
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,431
Wait, wait…

328
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,994
Wait!

329
00:42:44,678 --> 00:42:45,713
Agent Faustin.

330
00:42:46,413 --> 00:42:47,756
My 50000 francs.

331
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:50,886
But, I told you that…
- Sir!

332
00:42:51,252 --> 00:42:52,663
You're coming to the station!

333
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:55,466
You know who I am?!
Get your hands off!

334
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,367
Walk, I said. We're going

335
00:42:57,758 --> 00:43:00,364
Don't lay your hands on me.
Do you know me?

336
00:43:00,728 --> 00:43:01,934
Pay now!

337
00:43:02,129 --> 00:43:04,439
I'm going to your superiors!
You don't know me!

338
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:07,109
You! Get out of my sight.
You're fired!

339
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:09,110
Get those little legs out of here!

340
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:10,180
Pay the money!

341
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,676
Understood?

342
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:14,445
Mama, give me that money!

343
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:23,894
Take your money!

344
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,492
Don't ever come back here!

345
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:31,228
You dare bring the police here?!

346
00:43:31,392 --> 00:43:32,393
Get out! Leave!

347
00:43:32,793 --> 00:43:35,171
Get out!
I'm not giving you anything!

348
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,303
Wait,
I'll give you what you came for…

349
00:43:40,267 --> 00:43:41,337
Olivine, come here!

350
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:44,408
Take my child. Sell her!

351
00:43:44,738 --> 00:43:46,217
To pay off your debt.

352
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:48,750
Sell the child for your money.

353
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:50,081
What's going on?

354
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:52,655
That's no way to act!
- No, no, no…

355
00:43:52,846 --> 00:43:54,655
Go and sell her!

356
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,953
Let her take the child, papa.

357
00:43:58,185 --> 00:44:00,426
She can sell her to get her money back.

358
00:44:01,021 --> 00:44:03,763
She dares bring the police here.
Get out!

359
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:07,336
You owe her the money.
Stay calm.

360
00:44:07,828 --> 00:44:09,364
Move back, Sir.

361
00:44:10,097 --> 00:44:13,135
Work it out
- Mama, move back. Move back!

362
00:44:13,801 --> 00:44:14,779
The State will…

363
00:44:15,836 --> 00:44:18,373
Take this money. Take it and leave.

364
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:20,313
Get your hands off me!

365
00:44:20,474 --> 00:44:21,976
Is that a way to behave?

366
00:44:22,443 --> 00:44:24,320
It's the last time.
Look at her eyes!

367
00:44:29,116 --> 00:44:31,494
Hey, mama.
What are you giving me here?

368
00:45:17,998 --> 00:45:18,806
Mama.

369
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,870
It's 120000 short.

370
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:22,944
I know.

371
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,847
OK…

372
00:45:25,072 --> 00:45:27,052
I'll subtract the cost of the room.

373
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:29,719
What's left,
I'll keep as an advance.

374
00:45:30,944 --> 00:45:33,356
The day you pay we'll operate your boy.

375
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,988
Papa?
- Yes?

376
00:45:39,386 --> 00:45:40,888
Listen, mama…

377
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:45,166
If you want,
we can put him with all the others.

378
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:47,201
It will be less expensive.

379
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:52,405
What do you say?
- No.

380
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,436
You want him over there?
- Yes.

381
00:45:54,768 --> 00:45:55,838
We can change his room.

382
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,205
No!

383
00:45:57,438 --> 00:46:00,317
Leave him there.
I'll be back tonight to pay the rest.

384
00:46:00,707 --> 00:46:01,913
OK, fine.

385
00:46:07,815 --> 00:46:08,384
Here.

386
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:44,721
Samo is at the hospital.

387
00:47:48,215 --> 00:47:49,353
He needs an operation.

388
00:47:49,816 --> 00:47:51,386
He had a motorbike accident.

389
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:56,792
You got rid of me.

390
00:47:58,425 --> 00:47:59,733
Give me some money.

391
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,731
Who showed you where I live?

392
00:48:11,004 --> 00:48:12,449
It's not for me, it's for the kid.

393
00:48:12,773 --> 00:48:14,411
Give me some money. I'll leave.

394
00:48:16,243 --> 00:48:19,747
Whose motorbike was he on?

395
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:23,722
Does he go to school?

396
00:48:26,453 --> 00:48:27,363
You see!

397
00:48:28,021 --> 00:48:29,159
You've raised a thug!

398
00:48:29,756 --> 00:48:31,099
But he's your son.

399
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:37,008
You wanted to be a strong woman!

400
00:48:37,264 --> 00:48:39,870
With lessons to give to the whole world!

401
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:43,236
This isn't about you and me.

402
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:45,741
So what are you doing here?

403
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,679
It's for your child.

404
00:48:49,876 --> 00:48:51,753
You don't know what to do.

405
00:48:52,379 --> 00:48:53,722
You're less cocky now!

406
00:48:54,214 --> 00:48:56,626
The price of pride!

407
00:48:57,951 --> 00:48:59,225
Give me the money.
I'll leave.

408
00:48:59,753 --> 00:49:01,790
You've raised a thug
in your own home!

409
00:49:02,055 --> 00:49:04,433
You puffed out your chest!
The strong woman!

410
00:49:04,758 --> 00:49:05,964
Fooling yourself!

411
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:07,900
Look at you now.

412
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:09,873
You don't know where to turn.

413
00:49:10,097 --> 00:49:11,075
You're useless!

414
00:49:14,134 --> 00:49:14,908
Get out!

415
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,071
Give me some money.

416
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,372
Out!

417
00:49:22,676 --> 00:49:23,916
Get out!
- I'm not leaving.

418
00:49:53,006 --> 00:49:54,007
What do you want?

419
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,285
I'm looking for the boss.

420
00:49:59,713 --> 00:50:01,021
Hello, mama.
- Hello.

421
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,826
You're looking for the boss?
- Yes.

422
00:50:04,051 --> 00:50:06,759
He didn't say he was expecting
anyone this morning.

423
00:50:06,953 --> 00:50:08,091
But he told me to come.

424
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:10,631
He always warns me
if somebody is coming.

425
00:50:10,824 --> 00:50:14,101
Do you know his whole family?
- No, but he didn't say anything.

426
00:50:14,327 --> 00:50:17,137
But you know me?
- No, it's the first time I see you.

427
00:50:17,297 --> 00:50:19,072
Why would I have come here?

428
00:50:19,232 --> 00:50:22,304
I don't know. I'll ask him.
- He asked me to come.

429
00:50:22,703 --> 00:50:24,273
You don't know his whole family!

430
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,748
No, wait here.
- You don't know who I am.

431
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:31,389
Madame, wait, I have to ask the boss
before letting you in.

432
00:50:31,712 --> 00:50:34,420
You think I'm a mad woman?
- You can't just enter like that.

433
00:50:35,248 --> 00:50:36,249
You can't just enter.

434
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:39,420
Wait for me to ask.
You're going to get me into trouble.

435
00:50:41,855 --> 00:50:44,893
You'll get me fired.
The boss won't like it.

436
00:50:47,494 --> 00:50:49,303
Wait while I ask the boss.

437
00:50:56,336 --> 00:50:58,316
Hello boss.
- Hello.

438
00:50:58,505 --> 00:50:59,916
There's someone here for you.

439
00:51:00,073 --> 00:51:01,051
For me?
- Yes.

440
00:51:01,775 --> 00:51:02,947
Your little sister.

441
00:51:08,949 --> 00:51:09,984
Hello, mama.

442
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,754
Hello, papa.

443
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,992
Do we know each other?

444
00:51:15,388 --> 00:51:16,458
No.

445
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,274
Papa, I'm here to ask for your help.

446
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:27,278
My son had a motorbike accident.

447
00:51:28,101 --> 00:51:29,409
He's in hospital.

448
00:51:29,736 --> 00:51:30,874
He needs an operation.

449
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,909
I have no money.
I've come to ask for your help.

450
00:51:34,107 --> 00:51:35,950
Help me, I am your sister.

451
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,850
Judith.
- Boss.

452
00:51:42,783 --> 00:51:44,785
Next time you let someone
in off the street,

453
00:51:45,418 --> 00:51:46,453
you're fired.

454
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,656
Forgive me, Boss.

455
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,163
Mama.

456
00:51:53,426 --> 00:51:54,769
How did you get in?

457
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,171
I stand before you as a singer.

458
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,139
I get by alone.

459
00:51:59,299 --> 00:52:02,178
I've come to you,
but I'm not someone who begs.

460
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:04,210
I've come to ask for your help.

461
00:52:04,437 --> 00:52:07,281
If you don't help me
my son will lose his leg.

462
00:52:07,474 --> 00:52:09,385
I have nowhere else to go.

463
00:52:10,477 --> 00:52:11,888
Judith.
- Boss.

464
00:52:12,412 --> 00:52:13,186
Is mama here?

465
00:52:13,747 --> 00:52:14,953
She's gone out, boss.

466
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,731
Auguste!

467
00:52:25,792 --> 00:52:27,863
Get her out of here. Now.
- Papa.

468
00:52:28,028 --> 00:52:29,735
You need to leave!
- Help me, papa.

469
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,398
Let's go.
- Have mercy, papa.

470
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:32,835
Mama, let's go!

471
00:52:33,433 --> 00:52:34,673
Mama.
- Papa.

472
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,107
Get back here! Leave!

473
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:39,182
Papa, please help me.
- Come here. Get out!

474
00:52:39,372 --> 00:52:41,147
Papa, don't leave me like this.

475
00:52:42,008 --> 00:52:42,918
Let go of me!

476
00:52:43,677 --> 00:52:44,382
Out!

477
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:48,248
Get her out. People will think
we're killing someone.

478
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:49,654
Out! Out!
- I'm dying!

479
00:52:50,016 --> 00:52:51,256
Help! I'm dying!

480
00:52:51,718 --> 00:52:52,458
Let go of me!

481
00:52:53,353 --> 00:52:54,297
Get out!

482
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:01,934
Come here, you. Out.

483
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,403
Get out.
- Let go of me!

484
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:08,305
Out. Out.
- I'm dying!

485
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,447
Stop. Leave her.

486
00:53:17,744 --> 00:53:18,722
Leave her be.

487
00:53:36,997 --> 00:53:38,943
I'm giving you this money out of pity.

488
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:41,204
If you come back, we will kill you.

489
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:43,975
Judith.
- Boss.

490
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:48,942
Give it to her.

491
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,120
Let's go, mama.

492
00:53:50,677 --> 00:53:52,281
And don't come back here.

493
00:53:52,445 --> 00:53:54,254
Your going to get me sacked.

494
00:54:48,902 --> 00:54:50,438
Doctor!

495
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:56,415
I have the money.

496
00:54:56,843 --> 00:54:59,221
Stay calm.
Mama, wait there, I'm coming.

497
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,423
I have to tell you something.

498
00:55:01,815 --> 00:55:03,692
Quiet now… Be calm.

499
00:55:04,184 --> 00:55:05,891
Try to calm down.

500
00:55:06,786 --> 00:55:08,697
No.That's not it.
Listen to me first.

501
00:55:08,989 --> 00:55:11,128
After you left, his leg got much worse.

502
00:55:11,324 --> 00:55:13,133
He lost a lot more blood.

503
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:15,796
We've just amputated the leg.

504
00:55:16,763 --> 00:55:20,267
We absolutely had to, otherwise…

505
00:55:20,467 --> 00:55:22,970
Listen.
Otherwise he would be dead.

506
00:55:23,136 --> 00:55:24,740
So…

507
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:27,384
No, first, listen to me.
Listen.

508
00:55:27,707 --> 00:55:30,381
Everything will be alright.
God will watch over him.

509
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,150
The fan isn't working.

510
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,622
I'm going to get you another one.

511
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,130
A fan.

512
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:08,730
Can you come with me to get Samo?

513
00:59:10,697 --> 00:59:12,301
Somebody will have to carry him.

514
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:16,301
No problem.

515
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,144
No problem.

516
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:54,920
You really have to look after his leg.

517
01:02:54,921 --> 01:02:57,868
You really have to look after his leg.

518
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:01,132
It's not the end of the world.

519
01:03:02,094 --> 01:03:04,438
What matters most,
is that he is still alive.

520
01:03:04,831 --> 01:03:07,869
That's what really matters to us.

521
01:03:08,434 --> 01:03:09,334
You've got to follow his treatment.

522
01:03:09,335 --> 01:03:10,678
You've got to follow his treatment.

523
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:13,749
His pills… you really must
make sure he takes them.

524
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,772
You will need to help the boy.

525
01:03:37,964 --> 01:03:38,563
Especially with his crutches…

526
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:39,975
Especially with his crutches…

527
01:03:42,168 --> 01:03:45,775
So that he doesn't start
having problems with the other leg.

528
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,836
Careful, watch out for the wound.

529
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:35,080
You see that robot, Félicité?

530
01:05:35,081 --> 01:05:36,617
You see that robot, Félicité?

531
01:05:36,816 --> 01:05:40,730
That robot was built here in the Congo.

532
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,093
Our Congo will go a long way!

533
01:05:43,789 --> 01:05:44,961
Just like me, Tabu.

534
01:05:45,124 --> 01:05:48,196
One day, you will be amazed
to see me on the TV,

535
01:05:48,928 --> 01:05:49,494
literally standing on the moon.

536
01:05:49,495 --> 01:05:50,838
Literally standing on the moon.

537
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:54,310
Jumping from star to star,

538
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,805
from one to the other,

539
01:05:57,003 --> 01:05:59,005
like those guys on their motorbikes…

540
01:05:59,438 --> 01:06:01,440
Because I am great, me, Tabu!

541
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,282
I am greater than all the stars.

542
01:06:05,277 --> 01:06:07,757
The stars are nothing to me.

543
01:06:09,015 --> 01:06:09,959
Are you with me?

544
01:06:10,149 --> 01:06:11,958
The stars are tiny to me.

545
01:06:13,786 --> 01:06:14,992
Yes, mama?

546
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:17,295
Félicité.

547
01:06:33,305 --> 01:06:33,538
Mama, your troubles touched our hearts.

548
01:06:33,539 --> 01:06:35,314
Mama, your troubles touched our hearts.

549
01:06:36,008 --> 01:06:38,614
Everything is in the hands of God.

550
01:06:39,078 --> 01:06:41,991
Without God,
we may have lost the child.

551
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,364
Hang in there, my friend.

552
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,623
All this was God's will.
- Yes, God's will.

553
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:52,201
The child has been saved.

554
01:06:52,391 --> 01:06:54,632
Let us Give thanks to God.

555
01:06:54,827 --> 01:06:56,135
Be brave.
- Hang in there.

556
01:06:56,295 --> 01:06:59,037
Be brave.

557
01:06:59,198 --> 01:07:01,644
Mama, I rejoice
that you are among us.

558
01:07:03,736 --> 01:07:06,410
Believe. God's will shall be done.

559
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,382
Be brave.

560
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:11,247
May God watch over you
and give you strength.

561
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:12,889
Look for God's presence.

562
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:14,888
He will help the boy recover.

563
01:07:15,047 --> 01:07:16,890
Be strong in prayer.

564
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,054
Be strong.

565
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,232
Thank you mama. God watches over us.

566
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:00,825
Thank you, mothers,
for coming to visit us.

567
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:02,066
Thank you, mothers,
for coming to visit us.

568
01:08:02,228 --> 01:08:04,071
But please leave us now.

569
01:08:04,263 --> 01:08:06,140
We need some peace and quiet.

570
01:08:06,732 --> 01:08:09,076
Thank you for the love you have shown us.

571
01:08:09,268 --> 01:08:10,770
Thank you, papa. Stay with God.

572
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:12,449
Thank you, mama.

573
01:08:12,772 --> 01:08:14,183
May God be with you.
- Thank you

574
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:15,240
By the grace of God,
may the child recover.

575
01:08:15,241 --> 01:08:17,312
By the grace of God,
may the child recover.

576
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:21,448
Thank you, all of you.
Please let us rest a bit.

577
01:08:21,781 --> 01:08:24,421
Thank you. Be well.
- Thank you.

578
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:28,112
Aren't you going to sing, Félicité?

579
01:09:28,113 --> 01:09:30,093
Aren't you going to sing, Félicité?

580
01:09:30,316 --> 01:09:31,420
Sing!

581
01:09:32,785 --> 01:09:34,196
Félicité I?

582
01:10:05,184 --> 01:10:07,095
Hello.
- Hello.

583
01:10:07,419 --> 01:10:08,989
Sing, sing, sing!

584
01:17:30,962 --> 01:17:32,339
Don't stay alone.

585
01:19:26,778 --> 01:19:28,724
We need to be able
to run this campus.

586
01:19:29,147 --> 01:19:31,684
But you, scoundrels,
why don't you give up?

587
01:19:32,918 --> 01:19:35,091
Friend, we are going to behead this woman.

588
01:19:35,287 --> 01:19:38,734
She has shown us no respect.
She will get a beating.

589
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:40,369
Hit her!

590
01:19:41,259 --> 01:19:42,101
Mama!

591
01:19:51,069 --> 01:19:54,607
But… I… told… you…
that… these… children…

592
01:19:54,773 --> 01:19:57,720
had… become… witches…
during childhood.

593
01:19:58,343 --> 01:20:01,381
But… no-one… helped… them…

594
01:20:50,362 --> 01:20:51,466
It's working.

595
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,239
This time, it's working.

596
01:21:04,809 --> 01:21:05,810
Idiot!

597
01:21:06,411 --> 01:21:08,015
The transformer.

598
01:21:57,862 --> 01:21:58,966
Are you going to eat?

599
01:22:01,399 --> 01:22:02,742
Eat!

600
01:23:01,493 --> 01:23:04,804
Must the sun come up?

601
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:09,334
Night has no brother,
no father, no mother.

602
01:23:11,002 --> 01:23:11,946
Oh good Sleep.

603
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:16,351
Come and reward those who love the Night.

604
01:23:18,043 --> 01:23:20,284
Only the crazy do not know her.

605
01:23:22,113 --> 01:23:25,754
They do not know
the precious taste of your fruit's juices.

606
01:23:26,317 --> 01:23:29,321
They do not see that you come
from ancient times.

607
01:23:29,788 --> 01:23:32,860
And that you approach us closely.

608
01:23:33,792 --> 01:23:36,932
You have the keys
of the doors to paradise.

609
01:24:24,909 --> 01:24:28,857
Haven't you got a 12V transformer?
- Transformer? I've got a 6V.

610
01:24:29,881 --> 01:24:32,122
Multiply it.
2 wires here, 2 wires there.

611
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:35,226
Depends how you power the device.

612
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:38,058
I need a 12.

613
01:24:38,456 --> 01:24:40,094
Thieves! Thieves!!

614
01:24:40,959 --> 01:24:41,733
Stop them!

615
01:24:48,133 --> 01:24:49,339
Catch them!

616
01:25:04,182 --> 01:25:05,422
Hit them!

617
01:25:09,487 --> 01:25:10,727
Tie them up!

618
01:25:16,761 --> 01:25:17,796
Hit him!

619
01:25:26,404 --> 01:25:28,247
Calm down. Calm down!

620
01:25:28,406 --> 01:25:30,079
Wait.

621
01:28:33,157 --> 01:28:34,659
I know you well.

622
01:28:36,194 --> 01:28:38,765
I know your real name, mama.

623
01:28:39,330 --> 01:28:40,866
My needle.

624
01:28:41,165 --> 01:28:43,668
You wounded my heart.

625
01:28:44,068 --> 01:28:45,741
Let me go.

626
01:28:46,437 --> 01:28:48,678
I never stay in the same place.

627
01:28:48,906 --> 01:28:51,853
Remove the thorns from your heart.

628
01:28:52,276 --> 01:28:53,755
Because your heart

629
01:28:54,145 --> 01:28:56,022
is made for my hands.

630
01:29:39,957 --> 01:29:41,732
What nonsense.
- Sorry.

631
01:29:41,959 --> 01:29:43,996
What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

632
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:46,374
Barman!

633
01:29:47,065 --> 01:29:50,205
Bring them all flavours,
it's my round.

634
01:29:53,337 --> 01:29:56,147
You've drunk up your money
from yesterday and today.

635
01:29:56,307 --> 01:29:59,049
I'll pay for my own beer.
Idiot!

636
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,385
What are you saying, your?

637
01:30:05,116 --> 01:30:06,959
I see you have money tonight.

638
01:30:07,218 --> 01:30:08,925
Been working a lot, have you?

639
01:30:09,187 --> 01:30:11,633
Where did you find that money?

640
01:30:12,457 --> 01:30:13,162
Tabu!

641
01:30:13,357 --> 01:30:15,928
I'm telling you now,
don't get on my nerves!

642
01:30:16,127 --> 01:30:17,003
Do you hear me?

643
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:19,831
Idiot.

644
01:30:20,364 --> 01:30:22,139
What are you drinking?

645
01:30:25,069 --> 01:30:27,208
You have no money.
Just get out, leave.

646
01:30:27,438 --> 01:30:29,884
You're crazy.
- OK. Fine.

647
01:30:30,074 --> 01:30:32,350
That guy's crazy. Move back!

648
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:33,750
OK!

649
01:30:33,945 --> 01:30:36,721
If you have money,
buy us a bottle of whisky.

650
01:30:36,881 --> 01:30:37,450
Barman!

651
01:30:37,815 --> 01:30:39,954
Bring them two bottles of whisky.

652
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:41,959
On my tab.

653
01:31:14,185 --> 01:31:16,290
I told you…

654
01:31:16,454 --> 01:31:18,730
Today is different.

655
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,426
It's a special clientele.

656
01:31:20,758 --> 01:31:22,499
If you don't behave,
I'll kick you out.

657
01:31:22,827 --> 01:31:23,897
You hear me?

658
01:31:24,061 --> 01:31:25,472
You cause too much trouble.

659
01:31:25,830 --> 01:31:27,241
Go and sleep it off.

660
01:31:31,202 --> 01:31:32,408
You're right.

661
01:31:34,105 --> 01:31:35,345
I'm not paying for anything.

662
01:31:36,307 --> 01:31:37,445
If you like,

663
01:31:38,142 --> 01:31:40,213
go and serve yourself from the till.

664
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:43,221
On my tab!

665
01:31:46,484 --> 01:31:48,964
People like you sponge
off other people…

666
01:31:49,687 --> 01:31:51,758
Off people like me,

667
01:31:52,356 --> 01:31:54,461
for the whores you're with.

668
01:42:13,343 --> 01:42:14,481
Can you also talk?

669
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,154
Sorry. Excuse me.

670
01:42:24,254 --> 01:42:25,392
Is your mother here?

671
01:45:27,504 --> 01:45:29,279
You are from a people with dignity

672
01:45:31,208 --> 01:45:33,313
We are more beautiful than heroes.

673
01:45:35,012 --> 01:45:36,423
We are the truth.

674
01:45:37,347 --> 01:45:38,758
We are more beautiful

675
01:45:39,182 --> 01:45:40,354
than lies.

676
01:45:42,452 --> 01:45:44,227
You're old enough to get angry.

677
01:45:44,788 --> 01:45:45,960
Get angry!

678
01:45:47,257 --> 01:45:49,794
Everything has to be done
over and over again.

679
01:45:50,093 --> 01:45:51,128
More.

680
01:45:52,329 --> 01:45:54,206
I'll be with you.

681
01:45:55,332 --> 01:45:57,073
Because I am your soldier.

682
01:45:58,668 --> 01:45:59,703
More.

683
01:45:59,970 --> 01:46:01,347
You will be brave.

684
01:46:02,005 --> 01:46:04,110
Because you don't have a choice.

685
01:46:04,808 --> 01:46:06,810
The night will help you.

686
01:46:12,282 --> 01:46:14,762
If you lack money, drink water.

687
01:46:17,054 --> 01:46:21,230
Those without money, live in suffering.

688
01:46:26,063 --> 01:46:27,940
Ah, me, Tabu!

689
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:43,148
If I get fucked up,
it's none of your business.

690
01:46:44,081 --> 01:46:45,788
Ah, the world!

691
01:46:47,918 --> 01:46:50,831
Oh, life is beautiful!
- …Life is…

692
01:49:36,286 --> 01:49:37,629
Careful.

693
01:49:41,391 --> 01:49:45,635
Have pity on me, my love
Have pity on me, my heart

694
01:49:45,862 --> 01:49:51,403
I work hard night and day
to offer you happiness

695
01:49:53,403 --> 01:49:57,180
Every morning, early, I wake…

696
01:49:57,874 --> 01:49:59,114
You sing badly.

697
01:50:05,448 --> 01:50:07,189
Félicité.

698
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:10,422
Girl of legendary beauty.

699
01:50:11,254 --> 01:50:15,396
On this day,
you have destroyed this world.

700
01:50:16,259 --> 01:50:20,435
Beyond,
look at the pleasure of the sky.

701
01:50:21,131 --> 01:50:22,701
I let myself go.

702
01:50:22,966 --> 01:50:23,740
You can't sing.

703
01:50:23,933 --> 01:50:25,139
Entirely for you.

704
01:50:25,368 --> 01:50:27,814
You sing badly. Please stop.

705
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,249
I'm not your wife.
I won't allow you to.

706
01:50:34,411 --> 01:50:36,152
I am nobody's husband.

707
01:50:38,014 --> 01:50:40,790
Your face, mama.

708
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:49,066
Your face, mama.

709
01:50:49,826 --> 01:50:52,466
My God, like an armoured car.

710
01:52:04,734 --> 01:52:05,735
It's working.

711
01:52:09,439 --> 01:52:10,281
Switch on the TV.

712
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,417
Switch on the TV!
- No.

713
01:52:13,076 --> 01:52:14,384
I'm switching it on!

714
01:52:59,722 --> 01:53:00,928
Switch on the TV.

715
01:56:07,710 --> 01:56:10,020
I came back only for your eyes.

716
01:56:12,115 --> 01:56:13,355
Love me.

717
01:56:14,984 --> 01:56:16,725
But don't ask me for anything.

718
01:56:18,354 --> 01:56:20,766
I really like your way…

719
01:56:22,025 --> 01:56:23,003
of being.

720
01:56:24,260 --> 01:56:25,330
If you're like this

721
01:56:26,095 --> 01:56:27,733
things can work between us.

722
01:56:31,501 --> 01:56:33,708
Don't come here every day.

723
01:56:39,208 --> 01:56:41,210
What do you think I came for?

724
01:56:41,444 --> 01:56:43,185
For your good looks?

725
01:56:46,349 --> 01:56:47,851
So why did you come?

726
01:56:49,352 --> 01:56:50,763
I was nearby.

727
01:56:51,921 --> 01:56:53,696
It's not on your route.

728
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:56,798
I just popped in to say hello.

729
01:56:57,393 --> 01:56:59,134
Like that, for no particular reason?

730
01:57:03,032 --> 01:57:07,447
Have you ever seen manioc leaves
and a goat left in the same place?

731
01:57:11,474 --> 01:57:13,112
So then, why did you come?

732
01:57:14,243 --> 01:57:17,315
I just wanted to tell you…
I saw you in the forest.

733
01:57:19,415 --> 01:57:21,759
You are the one I was looking for.

734
01:57:23,953 --> 01:57:25,193
You were looking for me?

735
01:57:25,421 --> 01:57:27,765
Who would I be looking for in the forest?

736
01:57:27,924 --> 01:57:29,028
Here I am.
