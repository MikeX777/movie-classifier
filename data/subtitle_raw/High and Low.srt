1
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:33,716
HIGH AND LOW

2
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,205
What brings you here?

3
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:34,212
National Shoes is in business
to make money.

4
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:38,216
Take a look at this shoe.

5
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:41,219
Will it increase our sales?

6
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:43,221
Wait.

7
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,225
We're not losing money.

8
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:50,228
It's a good shoe, but it
costs too much.

9
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:52,230
Old-fashioned too.

10
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,232
And another thing.

11
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,237
It's too durable. Shoes
must wear out.

12
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:08,236
Shoes are accessories, like
hats and handbags.

13
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:11,249
Women want new styles at
moderate prices.

14
00:03:11,317 --> 00:03:13,251
Right.

15
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,254
Our shoes are practical...

16
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:21,259
but hats don't wear long.

17
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:23,261
Shoes shouldn't either.

18
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,265
I don't agree with you.

19
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,268
Hats are decoration.

20
00:03:30,336 --> 00:03:33,271
Shoes carry all your
body weight.

21
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,280
You win.

22
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:46,284
You may be satisfied with
this kind of shoe...

23
00:03:47,353 --> 00:03:52,290
but sales have been flat
for a whole year.

24
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,292
That's why we're here.

25
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,294
What do you want me to do?

26
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,299
Let me be Frank.

27
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:04,302
We are the directors
of our firm.

28
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:09,307
I'm in charge of sales, you,
the factory...

29
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:13,311
Ishimaru, design, Kamiya,
publicity.

30
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,314
Kawanishi's your top aide...

31
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:18,316
and a future executive.

32
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:24,322
We're all agreed on what
our problem is.

33
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,324
What is it?

34
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:28,326
Our president.

35
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:32,330
The Old Man's backward. Army
boots are more his style.

36
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:35,333
But he owns enough stock to tell
all of us what to do.

37
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,335
By the way...

38
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:50,348
Take a look at this design.
It's a sure winner.

39
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,350
Good work.

40
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:55,353
And it can be made at
half the cost.

41
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,359
Well?

42
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,362
What would the Old Man say?

43
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:07,365
Who cares?

44
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:13,371
He owns a lot of stock, but
we can join together.

45
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,374
He has 25%.

46
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:20,378
You have only 21%.

47
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,380
You can't vote him out.

48
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:28,387
Gondo, you own stock too, and
we're counting on you.

49
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:32,390
How about joining us?

50
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:37,395
With your 13%, we'd have 34%.

51
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:41,399
We could out-vote
the old mule.

52
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:45,403
And who'd be the new
president?

53
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:52,410
Well, you'd be in the running.

54
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:57,415
But as the new policy is
Baba's idea...

55
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:00,418
he'll be the next president.

56
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:03,421
You, executive director.

57
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:05,423
Fair enough?

58
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,454
The Old Man may be
old-fashioned...

59
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:40,458
but he makes real shoes.

60
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:43,461
Yours are trash.

61
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,463
Listen.

62
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:50,468
I came to work at National Shoes
when I was 16.

63
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:55,473
I've been in that factory
for 30 years.

64
00:06:56,542 --> 00:07:00,478
I know every sound and
smell there.

65
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:05,483
I remember every shoe
ever made...

66
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:07,485
all good, durable shoes.

67
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,489
I can't put our name on junk.

68
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,493
This wouldn't last a month.

69
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:19,497
There's no shank in it.

70
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:22,500
A cardboard base.
No sewing.

71
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:25,503
It's just glued together.

72
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,507
You want money for this?

73
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,509
The costs!

74
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,511
The profits!

75
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,513
- Business is business!
- I know.

76
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:39,517
But this business is my
life and love.

77
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:42,520
I can't do this.

78
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,523
So you'll make the Old Ma's
army boots?

79
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,526
No. The Old Man is wrong.

80
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:03,541
He's wrong. We're wrong.
Who's right?

81
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:09,548
I'll make my ideal shoes
durable, yet stylish.

82
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,550
Expensive to make, maybe...

83
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:16,554
but profitable in the long run.

84
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:20,558
How romantic. Only we
won't let you.

85
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:28,556
If we vote with the boss, we
can force you out.

86
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,569
Go ahead. The shareholder's
meeting is next month.

87
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,574
The gentlemen are leaving.
See them out.

88
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,586
You're leaving already?

89
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,590
Mrs. Gondo.

90
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:55,593
Isn't my husband seeing
you out?

91
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:25,623
What happened between
you and them?

92
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,625
Nothing.

93
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,627
Didn't look that way.

94
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:33,631
Don't worry. You wouldn't
understand.

95
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,633
It's business.

96
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:40,638
Business. That's what you
always say.

97
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,643
What's his game?

98
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:51,649
You're his right-hand man.
You must know.

99
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:55,653
He's confident enough to
throw us out.

100
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,656
What is he up to?

101
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:01,659
Why didn't you ask him?

102
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,661
Don't be sarcastic.

103
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:06,664
If you help us stop him...

104
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,667
We'll make you a director.

105
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,671
Don't tempt me.

106
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,675
You want to be his flunky forever?
Think it over.

107
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,635
Stop it, Jun!

108
00:10:57,717 --> 00:10:59,651
They're furious.

109
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:04,656
Are we safe?

110
00:11:04,724 --> 00:11:06,658
Wait and see.

111
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:09,661
Trouble again?

112
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,664
Looks like it.

113
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:16,668
They want to kick me out,
but I've taken steps.

114
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:21,673
- They'll have to be big steps.
- How?

115
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,678
Wait till it's all set.

116
00:11:27,747 --> 00:11:29,681
Then I'll kick them out.

117
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:35,687
He takes after you.

118
00:11:36,756 --> 00:11:39,691
He likes violent games.

119
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,693
Jun!

120
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:44,696
Oh, it's you, Shinichi.

121
00:11:44,764 --> 00:11:46,698
I'm the sheriff now.

122
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:50,702
Jun, is it your turn to be
the outlaw?

123
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:55,707
Then don't run. Hide and
ambush the sheriff.

124
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,710
A man's got to attack or be
attacked.

125
00:11:58,778 --> 00:12:00,712
Go on, and win.

126
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:08,720
It's getting worse.

127
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:11,723
Your attitude.

128
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:16,728
Success isn't worth losing
your humanity.

129
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:21,733
What do you know about it?

130
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:23,735
I just want to make good shoes.

131
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:30,742
Yes, it is.

132
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:33,745
Osaka Hotel?

133
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:35,747
You called Osaka?

134
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,749
One moment.

135
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:41,753
Room 310, please.
Gondo calling.

136
00:12:44,824 --> 00:12:48,760
Hello, it's me. How did it go?
All settled?

137
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:56,769
How much? Within my limit?
Good work!

138
00:12:57,837 --> 00:13:00,772
Yes, settle it.
Right away.

139
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,776
Say I'll send the deposit
tonight.

140
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:07,779
Call me back.

141
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:09,781
I'm counting you.

142
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:15,787
I want you to go to Osaka.
Book a fligth.

143
00:13:17,857 --> 00:13:21,793
Use the other phone. I'm
waiting for a call.

144
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,918
Is everything all right?

145
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:24,922
I'm frightened.

146
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,927
Hello. It's me.

147
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:34,932
So it's all set?

148
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,934
Just a moment.

149
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,937
10:00 p.m. Plane.

150
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:44,942
Kawanishi's off at 10:00 with a
check for 50 million.

151
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:53,951
Now a toast!

152
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:01,959
I kept it a secret, but now
I can tell you.

153
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:05,963
My share isn't 13%.

154
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:10,968
I've bought 15% more over
the last three years...

155
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:14,972
and I just arranged
for 19% more.

156
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,979
Even with the Old Man, they're
46% to my 46%.

157
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:24,982
It's a gamble, but National
shoes is mine.

158
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,988
How did you raise the money?

159
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:34,992
I borrowed on everything,
even this house.

160
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,998
Raising 50 million was rough.

161
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:47,004
One yen less... and Osaka
would have refused.

162
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:53,010
I've bet my whole fortune
on this.

163
00:15:56,081 --> 00:16:01,018
Wait. This is just the deposit,
isn't it?

164
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:06,023
It's only a third. What about
the other 100 million?

165
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:10,027
If I have control of the firm,
I'll get the rest.

166
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:20,037
Too big a surprise?
Have a drink.

167
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:25,042
Excuse me.

168
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:29,046
Is my boy, Shinichi, here?

169
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:32,049
He's outside with Jun. Why?

170
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,051
I brought him this.

171
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,053
I'll call Jun.

172
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,059
Aoki, drive Kawanishi
to the airport.

173
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:44,061
10:00 flight.

174
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,069
Yes, this is Gondo.

175
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:58,075
What? You... You have kidnapped
my son?

176
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,078
Stop joking!

177
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,080
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

178
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,083
<i>Listen. I have your son.</i>

179
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:10,087
<i>Do as I say, and he'll be safe.</i>

180
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,089
<i>Get 30 million yen.</i>

181
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,091
What?

182
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:17,094
<i>No consecutive numbers.</i>

183
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,096
Wait.

184
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,099
One thousand...

185
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,101
<i>10,000-yen notes...</i>

186
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:26,103
<i>three thousand 5,000-yen</i>
<i>notes...</i>

187
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,107
<i>and five thousand 1,000-yen</i>
notes.

188
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,109
Total: 30 million yen.

189
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:37,114
<i>Have it ready by tomorrow.</i>
<i>Then we'll talk again.</i>

190
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:40,117
<i>If you love your son, don't</i>
<i>call the police.</i>

191
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,119
No, of course not.

192
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:45,122
<i>Good-bye, Mr. Gondo.</i>

193
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:53,130
30 million yen? Please get
Jun back. Hurry!

194
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,132
Keep calm.

195
00:17:56,201 --> 00:18:00,137
I'll get him back, no matter
what it costs.

196
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,139
I'll raise more money later.

197
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,142
I'll call the police.

198
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,146
No! You want Jun to be killed?

199
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,151
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

200
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:20,157
Did you call me, Mom?

201
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,168
What's the matter?

202
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:38,175
What is this? A practical joke?

203
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,186
Jun, where's Shinichi?

204
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:55,193
I hid like you said, but he never
came. Some sheriff!

205
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,196
Shinichi was wearing
Jun's outfit.

206
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:02,199
Even I got them mixed up.

207
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,202
Shinichi!

208
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,207
Call the police.

209
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,210
No! The kidnapper might
hurt him.

210
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,213
A chauffeur can't pay ransom.

211
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,215
He'll let him go.

212
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:21,218
But I won't let him get away
with this.

213
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,230
The police?

214
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:37,234
No, a department store
delivery.

215
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,236
Odd at this hour.

216
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:43,240
What's keeping the police?

217
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:49,246
Don't worry. Your son's safe.

218
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:51,248
He has to be.

219
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:03,194
It's the police.

220
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:07,198
<i>Would you please close</i>
<i>all the drapes?</i>

221
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,283
I'm Chief Inspector Tokura.

222
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:31,288
From down there, if he's got
a telescope...

223
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:35,292
the kidnapper can see this
entire room.

224
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,296
- Any more phones?
- One upstairs.

225
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:42,299
- Listed?
- Just this one.

226
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,301
Here's the phone.

227
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,303
We'll get ready to
tap his calls.

228
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:52,309
Only he may not
call again.

229
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,312
Not if he finds out.

230
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,315
He may still think he
has your son.

231
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:02,319
Broadcast the mistake on
radio and TV.

232
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:05,322
Then he'll know you've
notified us.

233
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,324
So?

234
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:10,327
He warned you he'd
kill the boy.

235
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,329
He thought the had
my son.

236
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:15,332
He has to return him.

237
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,337
You think so, but the kidnapper
may not.

238
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:31,282
Kidnapping cases are hard.

239
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:35,286
His protection is the hostage.

240
00:21:36,355 --> 00:21:39,290
On our way here the
Chief told us...

241
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:44,295
"Save the child first, then
catch the kidnapper."

242
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:56,297
And this time we must be
especially careful.

243
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,309
They usually ask 200,000.

244
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:01,312
The highest was two million.

245
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,314
30 million is an incredible
ransom.

246
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:08,319
The kidnapper's extreme, maybe
mentally disturbed.

247
00:22:12,391 --> 00:22:14,325
You're the boy's father?

248
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:20,331
A widower. It's his only
child too.

249
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:22,333
You'll find him.

250
00:22:23,402 --> 00:22:26,337
We'll do our best.

251
00:22:27,406 --> 00:22:29,340
What will you do?

252
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:32,343
Wait for his next move.
It's all we can do.

253
00:22:33,412 --> 00:22:35,346
It's an ordeal for you...

254
00:22:35,414 --> 00:22:39,350
but safest for the boy.

255
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:42,353
All ready.

256
00:22:42,421 --> 00:22:47,358
Have the telephone company
trace all calls here.

257
00:22:49,428 --> 00:22:51,362
Where's your son, Mrs. Gondo?

258
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,364
Inside.

259
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:58,369
Ask him what happened before
and after the kidnapping.

260
00:22:58,437 --> 00:23:01,372
Wait. Nakao, you go.

261
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,376
Taguchi might frighten
the boy.

262
00:23:07,446 --> 00:23:10,381
You talk to the father.

263
00:23:10,449 --> 00:23:13,384
Do you have a recent photo?

264
00:23:13,452 --> 00:23:15,386
Yes. I'll get it.

265
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,396
It's time to drive Mr. Kawanishi
to the airport.

266
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:30,401
You're in no shape to go.
Take a cab.

267
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:37,408
Wait. It may be the
kidnapper.

268
00:23:38,477 --> 00:23:40,411
Upstairs phone.

269
00:23:40,479 --> 00:23:44,415
Keep him talking. Maybe we
can trace him.

270
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:56,427
Hello. Gondo speaking.

271
00:23:58,497 --> 00:24:01,432
<i>Hello. Gondo speaking.</i>

272
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:05,436
<i>I got the wrong boy.</i>

273
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:09,440
<i>Don't celebrate yet. Listen.</i>

274
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:13,444
<i>I don't care whose boy it is.</i>
<i>You're paying.</i>

275
00:24:13,512 --> 00:24:15,446
<i>Why me?</i>

276
00:24:15,514 --> 00:24:17,448
<i>Don't ask.</i>

277
00:24:17,516 --> 00:24:22,453
<i>Just pay up, or he dies.</i>
<i>Understand?</i>

278
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:24,455
<i>Absurd.</i>

279
00:24:24,523 --> 00:24:26,457
<i>Exactly. It's absurd.</i>

280
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:30,461
<i>The wrong boy's a lucky</i>
break for me.

281
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:33,464
<i>Extortion can only be threats...</i>

282
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:40,461
<i>against a person or his kin.</i>

283
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:43,474
<i>So I can't be charged</i>
<i>with extortion.</i>

284
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:47,478
<i>But you have to pay anyway.</i>

285
00:24:47,546 --> 00:24:50,481
<i>You're a fool to pay,</i>
<i>but you must.</i>

286
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,486
<i>Who says I'll pay?</i>
<i>I absolutely will not.</i>

287
00:24:55,554 --> 00:24:57,488
<i>You will.</i>

288
00:24:57,556 --> 00:25:02,493
<i>You won't kill him. You don't</i>
<i>have the guts, Mr Gondo.</i>

289
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:06,497
A fiend.

290
00:25:15,574 --> 00:25:18,509
Smartest crook I ever saw.

291
00:25:18,577 --> 00:25:20,511
He could kidnap any child...

292
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:23,514
and ask ransom for anyone.

293
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:26,517
And it's not extortion.

294
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:29,520
Not kidnapping for gain

295
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:35,527
Simple kidnapping. He'd get only
five years at most.

296
00:25:38,597 --> 00:25:40,531
This is no joke.

297
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:48,539
It's absurd. He can't get
away with it.

298
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:53,544
It's not just moneyche wants
from me.

299
00:25:53,612 --> 00:25:58,549
He wants me to be humiliated,
to suffer.

300
00:25:58,617 --> 00:26:03,554
Forcing me to throw away my
hard earned money.

301
00:26:03,622 --> 00:26:06,557
He wants to laugh at me.

302
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:09,560
I won't let him.
I won't pay him.

303
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,565
I'll tell him so next time.

304
00:26:16,635 --> 00:26:18,569
No ransom. Never!

305
00:26:34,653 --> 00:26:36,587
Ow! That hurts.

306
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:40,591
Put him to bed.

307
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:43,594
I'm not sleepy. I'll wait
for Shinichi.

308
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:51,602
He understands what's happened.

309
00:26:52,671 --> 00:26:56,607
He feels responsible for it.

310
00:26:58,677 --> 00:27:01,612
I feel the same way.

311
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,616
No one's responsible.
The man is a maniac.

312
00:27:05,684 --> 00:27:09,620
But Shinichi was kidnapped
in place of your son.

313
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:14,625
Then you think the ransom
should be paid?

314
00:27:14,693 --> 00:27:17,628
You know the position
Mr. Gondo is in.

315
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:22,633
But he was willing to pay
for his own son.

316
00:27:22,701 --> 00:27:24,635
Said he could raise more
money later.

317
00:27:24,703 --> 00:27:26,637
How? From where?

318
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:31,642
He's mortgaged everything.

319
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:37,648
He can't raise more money
to save his own life.

320
00:27:37,716 --> 00:27:39,650
Giving 30 million to a madman.

321
00:27:39,718 --> 00:27:41,652
Stop it!

322
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:52,663
Let's go to bed.

323
00:27:52,731 --> 00:27:53,663
But I...

324
00:27:53,732 --> 00:27:55,666
Come on.
Time for bed.

325
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,754
Inspector.

326
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,759
Can you promise the boy's safety
if Mr. Gondo pays?

327
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,764
The boy may be dead
by now.

328
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:30,767
Or he may be killed
afterwards.

329
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:33,770
What's the sense
in paying?

330
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:40,778
But if he is still alive,
we can still hope.

331
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:49,786
What will the kidnapper do
if he isn't paid?

332
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:51,788
Would he kill the boy?

333
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:58,796
From the way he talks, he
seems intelligent.

334
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:03,800
I don't think he'd risk capital
punishment.

335
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:09,807
He may be intelligent, but he's
not a rational person.

336
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:13,810
His plan is so cruel, he
must be sick.

337
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:17,814
We must believe he'll
carry it through.

338
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:22,819
If he's paid, he'll return the
boy as he said.

339
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:26,823
If not, he said he'd kill
him, didn't he?

340
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:36,833
It's a vicious case.

341
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:41,838
I'll ask the Chief for a special
investigation.

342
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:44,841
See what you can find
out here.

343
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:54,852
Mr. Gondo, call us before you
answer the phone.

344
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:05,862
What about me? Am I going
to Osaka or not?

345
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,866
If I am, I'd better hurry.

346
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:17,874
Why are you hesitating?
It's very clear.

347
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:21,878
Pay ransom and we're ruined.
That's all there is to it.

348
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,880
Go.

349
00:30:28,953 --> 00:30:31,888
I'm going, no matter who's
calling.

350
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:33,890
All right, go.

351
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,895
No Kawanishi, wait!

352
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:44,901
Inspector!

353
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:50,907
Keep him talking. We need
more than last time.

354
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,909
Upstairs phone okay?

355
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:03,920
Hello. This is Gondo.

356
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:07,924
<i>The boy's fine. I'll let him</i>
<i>talk to you.</i>

357
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:10,927
<i>Daddy? Are you there?</i>

358
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:12,929
Shinichi!

359
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:16,933
<i>Whether he lives or dies...</i>

360
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,937
<i>depends on you.</i>

361
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:23,940
<i>Good night, Mr. Gondo.</i>

362
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:31,948
He got away again.

363
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,956
Please save my son!

364
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:46,964
I couldn't ask you before to
pay all that money.

365
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:54,972
But now I've heard his voice...

366
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,973
and I must.

367
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,976
Please save him!

368
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:05,982
Once he's safe, the police will
get your money back.

369
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:09,986
Please lend it to me!

370
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:13,990
I'll do everything you want
till the day I die.

371
00:32:14,058 --> 00:32:16,993
I'll make my son work too.

372
00:32:17,061 --> 00:32:20,997
Stop it. Stand up. Damn it,
stand up.

373
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,999
Please save him!

374
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:25,001
Stand up, I said!

375
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:31,008
I want to pay, but I can't.
You don't understand.

376
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:33,009
I'm going.

377
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:36,012
Wait.

378
00:32:39,083 --> 00:32:43,019
Get up. Please get up.

379
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:47,023
He won't let your son die.

380
00:32:47,091 --> 00:32:50,026
I'll reason with him too.
It'll be all right.

381
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:52,028
It'll be all right.

382
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:57,033
Isn't Shinichi back yet?

383
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:04,040
Go to Osaka tomorrow.

384
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:06,042
Postpone it!

385
00:33:16,054 --> 00:33:17,988
Then I'll return this.

386
00:33:34,072 --> 00:33:36,006
Excuse me. I'm tired.

387
00:34:11,943 --> 00:34:14,878
<i>Please close the curtains.</i>

388
00:34:14,946 --> 00:34:16,880
Sorry.

389
00:34:24,956 --> 00:34:26,890
You slept here?

390
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:28,892
No, the Bos'n and I...

391
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,894
Bos'n?

392
00:34:30,962 --> 00:34:33,897
The Bos'n is head of
our squad.

393
00:34:34,966 --> 00:34:39,903
A lot of our work is connected
with the harbor.

394
00:34:39,971 --> 00:34:42,906
"Bos'n" fits him.
A real slave driver.

395
00:34:42,974 --> 00:34:44,908
Dragging me out all night.

396
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:46,910
You dragged me out.

397
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:50,914
Scaling walls...

398
00:34:50,982 --> 00:34:55,919
and hiding in shadows
like thieves.

399
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:03,928
The Chief has set up a
special section.

400
00:35:03,995 --> 00:35:06,930
We can use the whole
police force.

401
00:35:06,998 --> 00:35:12,937
The kidnapper says he isn't
extorting money...

402
00:35:13,004 --> 00:35:19,933
but he's driven you into a corner
and demands ransom.

403
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:23,947
The department says that's
"kidnapping for gain."

404
00:35:24,015 --> 00:35:25,949
It's a maximum 15 years
imprisonment.

405
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:29,953
That doesn't help me.

406
00:35:32,023 --> 00:35:33,957
His deadline is today.

407
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:38,962
I thought it over all night.

408
00:35:40,031 --> 00:35:41,965
This is my decision.

409
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:56,981
The boy's father wants me to
lend him the money.

410
00:35:57,048 --> 00:35:59,983
He says once his boy's safe...

411
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:01,985
you'll get my money back.

412
00:36:02,053 --> 00:36:04,988
But even if you guarantee it...

413
00:36:05,056 --> 00:36:08,992
I won't pay any ransom.

414
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,994
I'd get it back too late.

415
00:36:12,063 --> 00:36:18,002
Without that money now,
I'll lose everything.

416
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:22,005
Please understand me.

417
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:27,010
My work is part of me. Without it,
I'd be dead.

418
00:36:30,081 --> 00:36:36,020
You may say I'm callous, but
won't pay the ransom.

419
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,024
It's not true.

420
00:36:41,092 --> 00:36:43,026
I know he'll pay it.

421
00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:45,028
I won't.

422
00:36:45,096 --> 00:36:48,031
I can't.

423
00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:52,035
I told you why last night.

424
00:36:53,104 --> 00:36:57,040
You know what'll happen
if I pay?

425
00:36:57,108 --> 00:36:59,042
I'll be bankrupt.

426
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:04,047
They'll force me out on
the street.

427
00:37:05,116 --> 00:37:09,052
You'll be all right.
You can start over.

428
00:37:10,121 --> 00:37:13,056
What do you know
about poverty?

429
00:37:13,124 --> 00:37:19,063
A big house, fancy clothes
and fine food.

430
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,065
That's been your life.

431
00:37:24,135 --> 00:37:27,070
I could start over, but
you can't.

432
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:32,075
Yes, I can. I don't want luxury.

433
00:37:32,143 --> 00:37:35,078
It's all you've ever known.

434
00:37:35,146 --> 00:37:39,082
That's why you can say,
"Pay the 30 million".

435
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,085
It doesn't mean anything to you.
You're spoiled.

436
00:37:42,153 --> 00:37:44,087
It's not that.

437
00:37:44,155 --> 00:37:48,091
Can't you see how the boy's
father feels?

438
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,095
Yes! I can't stand his
groveling.

439
00:37:52,163 --> 00:37:55,098
Look, I'd pay if I could.

440
00:37:56,167 --> 00:38:00,103
But I can't just think
about him!

441
00:38:00,171 --> 00:38:04,107
There's you and Jun and my
own survival.

442
00:38:05,176 --> 00:38:07,110
It's ridiculous!

443
00:38:07,178 --> 00:38:11,114
Plenty of men richer than me.
And at a time like this.

444
00:38:11,182 --> 00:38:17,121
It would be suicide for me to pay.
Why should I?

445
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,124
I know.

446
00:38:23,194 --> 00:38:26,129
But it can't be helped.

447
00:38:27,198 --> 00:38:30,133
Aoki has no choice but
to ask you.

448
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:35,138
I'm asking too.
So is Jun.

449
00:38:35,206 --> 00:38:39,142
Enough! I'm not paying, no
matter who asks me.

450
00:38:42,213 --> 00:38:46,149
I'm not paying any ransom.

451
00:38:56,227 --> 00:39:01,164
Just in time. Take this check
and get to Osaka.

452
00:39:04,235 --> 00:39:07,170
I've been thinking it over.

453
00:39:07,238 --> 00:39:09,172
What?

454
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,174
About that check.

455
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:16,179
Whether I should take it or not.

456
00:39:16,247 --> 00:39:19,182
You told me not to hesitate.

457
00:39:20,251 --> 00:39:23,186
Well, I was wrong.

458
00:39:25,256 --> 00:39:29,192
If I went to Osaka and
closed this deal...

459
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,194
you'd control the firm.

460
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:36,199
But you'd be hated for
sacrificing a child.

461
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:43,196
You'd be ruined. No one would
buy your shoes.

462
00:39:43,274 --> 00:39:46,209
You're not paid to think!

463
00:39:46,277 --> 00:39:48,211
Take this and go.

464
00:39:48,279 --> 00:39:50,213
No. Think about it.

465
00:39:51,282 --> 00:39:54,217
Think of Mrs. Gondo.

466
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:04,227
You got started on her dowry.

467
00:40:05,296 --> 00:40:09,232
She has a say in this, and
she wants to pay.

468
00:40:10,301 --> 00:40:12,235
And ruin myself?

469
00:40:12,303 --> 00:40:15,238
I know how much this money
means to you...

470
00:40:17,308 --> 00:40:20,243
but a life means more.

471
00:40:20,311 --> 00:40:22,245
A helpless child!

472
00:40:23,314 --> 00:40:26,249
A helpless child, eh?

473
00:40:26,317 --> 00:40:29,252
Sounds odd coming from you.

474
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,257
What happened to the cold-blooded
businessman?

475
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:36,259
When were you reborn?

476
00:40:37,328 --> 00:40:40,263
What happened after you
left last night?

477
00:40:40,331 --> 00:40:43,266
Nothing. I just...

478
00:40:45,336 --> 00:40:50,273
If I succeed, you'll be
an executive.

479
00:40:51,342 --> 00:40:55,278
You know that, so you were
ready to go last night...

480
00:40:56,347 --> 00:40:59,282
arguing with anyone who
stood in your way.

481
00:41:00,351 --> 00:41:02,285
But not today.

482
00:41:03,354 --> 00:41:06,289
Is it sabotage?

483
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:09,292
No. I just...

484
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,295
If I pay the ransom, there's
no deal.

485
00:41:13,364 --> 00:41:15,298
You want that?

486
00:41:15,366 --> 00:41:18,301
What are you up to?

487
00:41:20,371 --> 00:41:22,305
Shall I tell you?

488
00:41:22,373 --> 00:41:27,310
If the deal fails, I fail, and
three men celebrate.

489
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,315
You sold me to those three,
didn't you?

490
00:41:34,385 --> 00:41:36,319
Yes.

491
00:41:36,387 --> 00:41:39,322
- The Osaka deal?
- Everything.

492
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,324
Scum!

493
00:41:41,392 --> 00:41:47,331
All right, but let me
have my say.

494
00:41:47,398 --> 00:41:50,333
You weakened last night...

495
00:41:50,401 --> 00:41:53,336
enough to pay the ransom.

496
00:41:54,405 --> 00:41:59,342
What would happen to me then?

497
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:02,345
You'd be selling me.

498
00:42:03,414 --> 00:42:07,350
I had to protect myself.

499
00:42:07,418 --> 00:42:11,354
- Get out!
- I'll go.

500
00:42:12,423 --> 00:42:16,359
But you'll go next.

501
00:42:16,427 --> 00:42:20,363
Baba and the Old Man are
talking right now.

502
00:42:20,431 --> 00:42:25,368
But I still have the money.
I'll throw all out.

503
00:42:25,436 --> 00:42:27,370
I wonder.

504
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:31,374
Maybe the kidnapper's right.
You don't have the guts.

505
00:42:31,442 --> 00:42:34,377
Get out!

506
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:00,403
Mr. Gondo...

507
00:43:02,473 --> 00:43:05,408
I know it's late to be
saying this...

508
00:43:06,477 --> 00:43:10,413
but you have the right to
protect your own life.

509
00:43:11,482 --> 00:43:14,417
It's our duty to help you.

510
00:43:15,486 --> 00:43:17,420
We want to save the child...

511
00:43:18,489 --> 00:43:21,424
but not by sacrificing you.

512
00:43:24,495 --> 00:43:27,430
But we hope you'll do this:

513
00:43:27,498 --> 00:43:31,434
When the kidnapper calls,
say you'll pay.

514
00:43:31,502 --> 00:43:33,436
That's all.

515
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:37,440
Ask him when and where.

516
00:43:38,509 --> 00:43:41,444
We'll take it from there.

517
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:54,458
I'm sorry. I didn't know what
I was asking.

518
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:59,462
Please don't worry about
my son.

519
00:44:00,531 --> 00:44:05,468
The kidnapper was just
bluffing, that's all.

520
00:44:06,537 --> 00:44:10,473
No human being could kill
an innocent child.

521
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:15,478
Anyway, Shinichi is a
smart boy.

522
00:44:17,548 --> 00:44:21,484
He'll watch for his chance
to escape.

523
00:45:06,597 --> 00:45:08,531
Where's Gondo?

524
00:45:14,605 --> 00:45:16,539
<i>Mr. Gondo!</i>

525
00:45:18,609 --> 00:45:20,543
<i>Phone! Hurry!</i>

526
00:45:38,629 --> 00:45:41,564
Hello. This is Gondo.

527
00:45:41,632 --> 00:45:44,567
<i>You're not up to any tricks,</i>
<i>are you?</i>

528
00:45:44,635 --> 00:45:46,569
What do you mean?

529
00:45:46,637 --> 00:45:50,573
<i>Drapes closed in broad daylight.</i>
<i>First time.</i>

530
00:45:51,642 --> 00:45:54,577
<i>- You can see us?</i>
<i>- Very well.</i>

531
00:45:54,645 --> 00:45:56,579
<i>You're on a hilltop.</i>

532
00:45:57,648 --> 00:46:00,583
<i>It's hot as hell down here.</i>

533
00:46:00,651 --> 00:46:02,585
<i>An inferno. 105 degrees.</i>

534
00:46:02,653 --> 00:46:06,589
<i>But you're air-conditioned,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

535
00:46:06,657 --> 00:46:11,594
<i>I understand the closed windows,</i>
<i>but why the drapes?</i>

536
00:46:11,662 --> 00:46:14,597
<i>What are you up to?</i>

537
00:46:15,666 --> 00:46:17,600
Nothing.

538
00:46:17,668 --> 00:46:19,602
<i>Nothing?</i>

539
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:24,607
<i>People who are up to</i>
<i>something say that.</i>

540
00:46:27,678 --> 00:46:30,613
I'll open the drapes then.

541
00:46:40,691 --> 00:46:43,626
<i>Good. I can see you now.</i>

542
00:46:43,694 --> 00:46:46,629
<i>Your wife, the chauffeur...</i>

543
00:46:46,697 --> 00:46:49,632
<i>Only three, including you?</i>

544
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:52,635
Yes.

545
00:46:52,703 --> 00:46:54,637
<i>Let's talk, then.</i>

546
00:46:54,705 --> 00:46:57,640
<i>Have you decided to pay,</i>
<i>Mr. Gondo?</i>

547
00:47:00,711 --> 00:47:02,645
<i>I have no choice.</i>

548
00:47:04,715 --> 00:47:06,649
<i>And is the money ready?</i>

549
00:47:07,718 --> 00:47:11,654
By evening, but only if the
boy's all right.

550
00:47:11,722 --> 00:47:14,657
<i>- You heard him.</i>
- I want to see him.

551
00:47:15,726 --> 00:47:19,662
<i>- Lf I refuse?</i>
- I won't pay.

552
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:21,664
<i>It sounds fishy.</i>

553
00:47:22,733 --> 00:47:26,669
<i>I'll think it over, Mr. Gondo.</i>

554
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,684
Stay there!

555
00:47:41,752 --> 00:47:43,686
The kidnapper's watching.

556
00:47:44,755 --> 00:47:49,692
Damn. A little longer, and I
could've traced the call.

557
00:47:57,601 --> 00:48:00,536
Thank you, Mr. Gondo.

558
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:05,541
By talking like that, you bought
us more time.

559
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,546
Your demand was very helpful.

560
00:48:10,614 --> 00:48:14,550
We can start moving.

561
00:48:30,634 --> 00:48:33,569
Bank of Tokyo?

562
00:48:33,637 --> 00:48:36,572
It's Gondo. The branch
manager, please.

563
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,574
Gondo speaking.

564
00:48:40,644 --> 00:48:45,581
Send over 30 million
yen in cash.

565
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:53,590
No new bills and no consecutive
numbers.

566
00:48:54,658 --> 00:48:56,592
One thousand 10,000 notes...

567
00:48:57,661 --> 00:48:59,595
Three thousand 5,000 notes...

568
00:48:59,663 --> 00:49:02,598
and five thousand 1,000 notes.

569
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:07,603
Yes, right away.

570
00:49:13,677 --> 00:49:15,611
Stop it.

571
00:49:25,689 --> 00:49:28,624
I don't know what to say.

572
00:49:28,692 --> 00:49:30,626
Then don't say it.
Leave me alone.

573
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:48,644
- What is it?
- Mom's crying.

574
00:50:05,729 --> 00:50:07,663
<i>Hello. This is Gondo.</i>

575
00:50:08,732 --> 00:50:11,667
<i>You're not up to any tricks,</i>
<i>are you?</i>

576
00:50:14,738 --> 00:50:17,673
I hear a coin dropping.

577
00:50:17,741 --> 00:50:20,676
Check all the pay phones
in this area.

578
00:50:23,747 --> 00:50:27,683
The kidnapper's right. One case
holds 15 million yen.

579
00:50:30,754 --> 00:50:32,688
What a sight, eh?

580
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:40,696
<i>Hello. This is Gondo.</i>

581
00:50:40,764 --> 00:50:42,698
<i>Got the money?</i>

582
00:50:42,766 --> 00:50:44,700
<i>Yes, but...</i>

583
00:50:44,768 --> 00:50:48,704
<i>All right. You'll see</i>
<i>the boy first.</i>

584
00:50:48,772 --> 00:50:50,706
<i>- When?</i>
<i>- Tomorrow.</i>

585
00:50:50,774 --> 00:50:52,708
<i>We'll swap the boy</i>
<i>and the money.</i>

586
00:50:52,776 --> 00:50:54,710
<i>Where?</i>

587
00:50:54,778 --> 00:50:57,713
<i>Calm down and</i>
<i>listen carefully.</i>

588
00:50:59,783 --> 00:51:05,722
<i>Get two briefcases under 7 cm,</i>
<i>thick for the money.</i>

589
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:09,725
<i>Close them tight, but don't</i>
<i>lock them.</i>

590
00:51:10,794 --> 00:51:15,731
<i>Take them on tomorrow's</i>
<i>second bullet train.</i>

591
00:51:15,799 --> 00:51:19,735
<i>- Understood? That's all.</i>
<i>- But where to?</i>

592
00:51:19,803 --> 00:51:22,738
<i>Get on and you'll see,</i>
<i>Mr. Gondo.</i>

593
00:51:28,812 --> 00:51:34,751
He's much too smart to plan
to trade on the train.

594
00:51:35,819 --> 00:51:37,753
At a station?

595
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:41,757
That's risky too.
I wouldn't do it.

596
00:51:44,828 --> 00:51:48,764
Two cases under 7 cm.
Thick.

597
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:51,767
I wonder why.

598
00:51:52,836 --> 00:51:54,770
"Get on and you'll see".

599
00:51:59,843 --> 00:52:04,780
Say, Bos'n, where can we hide
these inside the cases?

600
00:52:04,848 --> 00:52:08,784
Can't take chances. I'll call
a professional.

601
00:52:09,853 --> 00:52:11,787
What do we need?

602
00:52:12,856 --> 00:52:15,791
We want to find him through
these brief cases.

603
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:22,799
We purposely chose
unusual ones.

604
00:52:23,867 --> 00:52:26,802
They're so conspicuous, he'll
have to get rid of them.

605
00:52:28,872 --> 00:52:32,808
He'll bury, sink, or burn them.

606
00:52:33,877 --> 00:52:35,811
If it gets wet...

607
00:52:35,879 --> 00:52:38,814
this powder gives off a
nasty smell.

608
00:52:39,883 --> 00:52:42,818
If this burns, it emits a
pink smoke.

609
00:52:42,886 --> 00:52:45,821
Not much hope...

610
00:52:47,891 --> 00:52:51,827
but it just might give
us a lead.

611
00:53:02,906 --> 00:53:04,840
Reiko!

612
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:12,848
My old tool bag. Would you
find it for me?

613
00:53:15,919 --> 00:53:19,855
If we record only the 1,000s,
will we make it?

614
00:53:20,924 --> 00:53:24,860
We can do ten a minute, 5,000
in 500 minutes.

615
00:53:25,929 --> 00:53:30,866
That's eight hours, 20 minutes.
Tem hours with coffee breaks.

616
00:53:31,935 --> 00:53:35,871
A waste of time. I never
notice numbers.

617
00:53:35,939 --> 00:53:38,874
We can't neglect any
possibility.

618
00:53:39,943 --> 00:53:44,880
When the boy's back, I'll flush
that rat out.

619
00:53:45,949 --> 00:53:48,884
I'd burn him alive.

620
00:53:48,952 --> 00:53:50,886
Fifteen years isn't enough.

621
00:54:04,968 --> 00:54:07,903
The capsule should go here...

622
00:54:08,972 --> 00:54:11,907
and the powder there.

623
00:54:27,991 --> 00:54:31,927
In the old days, shoemakers
made cases too.

624
00:54:33,997 --> 00:54:36,932
My apprentice days come
in handy again.

625
00:54:40,003 --> 00:54:41,937
Starting all over already.

626
00:55:07,964 --> 00:55:09,898
That Gondo is all right.

627
00:55:10,967 --> 00:55:14,903
Usually, I waste no love
on the rich.

628
00:55:15,972 --> 00:55:18,907
I didn't like him at first.

629
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:29,918
Excuse me.

630
00:55:34,991 --> 00:55:37,926
<i>"The boy's not on the train."</i>

631
00:55:46,002 --> 00:55:47,936
This isn't a pleasure trip.

632
00:56:09,092 --> 00:56:12,027
<i>Railway telephone service...</i>

<i>buffet car phone booth.</i>

636
00:56:33,116 --> 00:56:36,051
- That's him.
- What do we do?

637
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,055
The next stop is Atami.

638
00:56:41,124 --> 00:56:43,058
Go have coffee.

639
00:56:58,141 --> 00:57:00,075
Coffee.

640
00:57:08,151 --> 00:57:10,085
We just passed Kozu.

641
00:57:11,154 --> 00:57:13,088
<i>Perfect.</i>

642
00:57:13,156 --> 00:57:16,091
<i>You're about to cross the</i>
<i>Sakawa River.</i>

643
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:19,094
<i>He'll be at the foot</i>
<i>of the bridge.</i>

644
00:57:31,174 --> 00:57:33,108
Coffee.

645
00:57:52,795 --> 00:57:54,729
The boy's at the bridge.

646
00:57:54,797 --> 00:57:57,732
I'm supposed to toss
the money.

647
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,734
These windows don't open.

648
00:57:59,802 --> 00:58:01,736
He said the washroom window
opens seven cms.

649
00:58:03,806 --> 00:58:05,740
Damn it. Of course.

650
00:58:05,808 --> 00:58:10,745
There's no stop before Atami.
He'll get away clean.

651
00:58:10,813 --> 00:58:14,749
Damned clever. The wretch!

652
00:58:15,818 --> 00:58:18,753
Na emergency stop would
endanger the boy.

653
00:58:20,823 --> 00:58:23,758
He's got us on every angle.

654
00:58:23,826 --> 00:58:29,765
But he can't do this alone.
He's got help.

655
00:58:29,832 --> 00:58:32,767
We'll be able to see them.
Where's the boy?

656
00:58:32,835 --> 00:58:35,770
- Left side.
- Toss the cases here?

657
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:37,772
Yes, washroom window.

658
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,775
We'll look for the boy
from here.

659
00:58:40,843 --> 00:58:42,777
Split up for pictures.

660
00:58:42,845 --> 00:58:47,782
Still shots on the left and 8mm
front and rear.

661
00:58:51,854 --> 00:58:55,790
The bridge is coming up. Take a
good look at the boy.

662
00:58:55,858 --> 00:58:59,794
It could be a switch.
I don't know him.

663
00:58:59,862 --> 00:59:02,797
I'm trading my life.

664
00:59:02,865 --> 00:59:04,799
I won't make a mistake.

665
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,854
Shinichi!

666
01:00:01,924 --> 01:00:03,858
You're sure?

667
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:22,003
Now go get him.

668
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:25,006
For Mr. Gondo's sake, be
bloodhounds.

669
01:01:36,085 --> 01:01:38,019
Can you see the living room?

670
01:01:38,087 --> 01:01:41,022
This is the best view so far.

671
01:01:43,092 --> 01:01:45,026
The criminal knows this
area well.

672
01:01:45,094 --> 01:01:47,028
But would he use a phone
this close?

673
01:01:47,096 --> 01:01:49,030
Try the next one.

674
01:01:58,107 --> 01:02:00,041
The kidnapper's right.

675
01:02:00,109 --> 01:02:03,044

01:06:20,136 --> 01:06:22,070
but not much help yet.

706
01:06:22,138 --> 01:06:26,074
The figure is blurred in the
pictures, but it's helpful.

707
01:06:27,143 --> 01:06:29,077
Look at this.

708
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:36,084
It's the accomplice.

709
01:06:37,153 --> 01:06:43,092
See this? It's a farmer
with a cow.

710
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,094
This gives us information.

711
01:06:46,162 --> 01:06:50,098
A man with two bags ran
into the shadow...

712
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:53,101
then a car left.

713
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:58,106
We checked and found
car tracks.

714
01:06:58,174 --> 01:07:00,108
He bumped into a wall.

715
01:07:00,176 --> 01:07:04,112
We found bits of paint.

716
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:08,116
We had them checked with
the following results:

717
01:07:10,186 --> 01:07:14,122
The car's a gray Toyopet Crown,
59 model.

718
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:18,126
This is the car you rode in,
isn't it?

719
01:07:20,196 --> 01:07:21,128
Yes.

720
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:25,133
- Can I go?
- Yes.

721
01:07:26,202 --> 01:07:29,137
Shinichi, try to remember.

722
01:07:31,207 --> 01:07:34,142
You saw Mt. Fuji and the sea?

723
01:07:36,212 --> 01:07:39,147
What road did the car
take to the river?

724
01:07:40,216 --> 01:07:43,151
- I don't remember.
- Don't say that!

725
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:47,155
What did you see from
the car window?

726
01:07:48,224 --> 01:07:50,158
Lots of things.

727
01:07:52,228 --> 01:07:54,162
That won't do!

728
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:56,164
You must remember.
What did you see?

729
01:07:59,235 --> 01:08:01,169
Stop.

730
01:08:06,242 --> 01:08:09,177
When you remember, tell us.

731
01:08:16,252 --> 01:08:18,186
We know how you feel.

732
01:08:20,256 --> 01:08:22,190
We feel the same way.

733
01:08:23,259 --> 01:08:27,195
We're desperate to get
Mr. Gondo's money back.

734
01:08:28,264 --> 01:08:31,199
We can't let him lose it.

735
01:08:31,267 --> 01:08:33,201
Guests, sir.

736
01:08:35,271 --> 01:08:38,206
Go easier on the boy,
Mr. Aoki.

737
01:08:40,276 --> 01:08:42,210
Excuse me.

738
01:08:45,281 --> 01:08:49,217
He's remembered some
important things.

739
01:08:50,286 --> 01:08:56,225
They covered his nose with
gauze soaked in ether.

740
01:08:56,292 --> 01:08:58,226
He saw Mt. Fuji and the sea.

741
01:09:02,298 --> 01:09:04,232
That's all today.

742
01:09:09,305 --> 01:09:14,242
Oh, yes. We've received a
mountain of mail.

743
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:17,245
Mr. Gondo is hard pressed...

744
01:09:17,313 --> 01:09:20,248
but everyone admires him.

745
01:09:21,317 --> 01:09:24,252
Makes us feel better about
this case.

746
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:28,256
You're a hero. The public is
very sympathetic.

747
01:09:28,324 --> 01:09:31,259
But what about national shoes?

748
01:09:31,327 --> 01:09:34,262
The struggle for power
isn't pretty.

749
01:09:35,331 --> 01:09:40,268
We hear your position is shaky.

750
01:09:40,336 --> 01:09:42,270
Is it true?

751
01:09:43,339 --> 01:09:45,273
Frankly, we're worried.

752
01:09:45,341 --> 01:09:48,276
Sympathy costs nothing...

753
01:09:48,344 --> 01:09:52,280
but we've invested money.

754
01:09:52,348 --> 01:09:55,283
We're your biggest creditors...

755
01:09:55,351 --> 01:09:58,286
so we got together.

756
01:09:59,355 --> 01:10:02,290
We're returning the interest
you sent...

757
01:10:02,358 --> 01:10:07,295
to postpone paying us
the principal.

758
01:10:08,364 --> 01:10:11,299
Pay us when it falls due...

759
01:10:11,367 --> 01:10:15,303
or we'll attach your property.

760
01:10:17,373 --> 01:10:21,309
You can't pay a kidnapper...

761
01:10:21,377 --> 01:10:23,311
and not pay us.

762
01:10:46,402 --> 01:10:49,337
The house can be seen...

763
01:10:49,405 --> 01:10:52,340
from Nishi-ku and Naka-ku...

764
01:10:53,409 --> 01:10:55,343
but in some places...

765
01:10:55,411 --> 01:11:02,340
trees or buildings block
the view.

766
01:11:03,419 --> 01:11:07,355
These places are filled in
with hatch lines.

767
01:11:08,424 --> 01:11:10,358
From inside this circle...

768
01:11:10,426 --> 01:11:13,361
the living room can be seen...

769
01:11:13,429 --> 01:11:18,366
with an ordinary telescope.

770
01:11:19,435 --> 01:11:22,370
It can also be seen...

771
01:11:22,438 --> 01:11:24,372
from seven booths here.

772
01:11:26,442 --> 01:11:32,381
Each mark indicates a
phone booth.

773
01:11:33,449 --> 01:11:37,385
The best view...

774
01:11:37,453 --> 01:11:40,388
is from these three booths.

775
01:11:41,457 --> 01:11:46,394
We think the suspect used
one of these phones.

776
01:11:46,462 --> 01:11:50,398
He also said it was hot
where he was.

777
01:11:50,466 --> 01:11:54,402
He called a little before
9:00 a.m.

778
01:11:55,471 --> 01:11:59,407
<i>Which booths does the sun</i>
<i>shine on at that hour?</i>

779
01:11:59,475 --> 01:12:01,409
<i>Of the three...</i>

780
01:12:01,477 --> 01:12:05,413
<i>this one is shaded.</i>

781
01:12:06,482 --> 01:12:08,416
<i>So we can assume...</i>

782
01:12:08,484 --> 01:12:12,420
He used one of the other two.

783
01:12:12,488 --> 01:12:14,422
It seems...

784
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:19,427
he always watched them
with a telescope.

785
01:12:20,496 --> 01:12:24,432
So we can narrow down
where he lives...

786
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:26,434
to this vicinity.

787
01:12:27,503 --> 01:12:32,440
Judging from his voice, he
seems young.

788
01:12:33,509 --> 01:12:35,443
But with the boy...

789
01:12:35,511 --> 01:12:39,447
he wore a mask and dark
glasses.

790
01:12:41,517 --> 01:12:45,453
Next, a report on the phone
call to the train.

791
01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:57,465
You can only call the train...

792
01:12:57,533 --> 01:13:00,468
from Tokyo, Osaka, or Nagoya.

793
01:13:00,536 --> 01:13:03,471
It's relayed by microwave...

794
01:13:03,539 --> 01:13:06,474
but with a long delay.

795
01:13:06,542 --> 01:13:10,478
So we found where he was:

796
01:13:10,546 --> 01:13:13,481
Yuraku-cho, Tokyo.

797
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:18,486
Near the railroad station.

798
01:13:19,555 --> 01:13:25,494
But the shop woman had bad
eyes and worse hearing...

799
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:27,495
so we gave up.

800
01:13:28,564 --> 01:13:31,499
We asked at the shops
around there.

801
01:13:32,568 --> 01:13:36,504
But no one remembered a man...

802
01:13:36,572 --> 01:13:40,508
phoning there at that hour.

803
01:13:42,578 --> 01:13:44,512
Next.

804
01:13:46,582 --> 01:13:48,516
The boy mentioned Mt Fuji
and the sea.

805
01:13:48,584 --> 01:13:50,518
Any leads?

806
01:13:55,257 --> 01:13:58,192
He drew a picture.

807
01:14:08,337 --> 01:14:11,272
The call was only local
long distance.

808
01:14:12,341 --> 01:14:14,275
A nearby spot...

809
01:14:15,344 --> 01:14:18,279
Where you can see Mt. Fuji
and the sea...

810
01:14:18,347 --> 01:14:22,283
has to be around Kamakura.

811
01:14:24,353 --> 01:14:27,288
A setting sun, maybe.

812
01:14:28,357 --> 01:14:31,292
It looks that way all
along the coast.

813
01:14:36,365 --> 01:14:38,299
Next, the ether.

814
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:44,305
It's hard to trace.

815
01:14:45,374 --> 01:14:48,309
Druggists don't carry it.

816
01:14:49,378 --> 01:14:53,314
Hospitals and doctors get
it wholesale.

817
01:14:54,383 --> 01:14:59,320
But ether is used in
industry too.

818
01:15:00,389 --> 01:15:03,324
So we can't be sure...

819
01:15:04,393 --> 01:15:09,330
the suspect is in medicine.

820
01:15:09,398 --> 01:15:11,332
In industry...

821
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:16,337
it's used by shipbuilders and
auto manufacturers...

822
01:15:16,405 --> 01:15:19,340
and by small iron works...

823
01:15:19,408 --> 01:15:22,343
and repair shops too.

824
01:15:27,349 --> 01:15:29,283
Next, the car.

825
01:15:34,356 --> 01:15:38,292
The farmer said it was
a gray car.

826
01:15:39,361 --> 01:15:42,296
It was probably stolen.

827
01:15:43,365 --> 01:15:47,301
I asked Vehicle Theft to check.

828
01:15:47,369 --> 01:15:52,306
This month, 18 Toyopets
were stolen.

829
01:15:52,374 --> 01:15:56,310
But before this case came up,
12 were found.

830
01:15:57,379 --> 01:16:01,315
That leaves six still around, and
only one is gray.

831
01:16:05,387 --> 01:16:09,323
And it was stolen the day before
this case broke.

832
01:16:10,392 --> 01:16:12,326
The license number...

833
01:16:14,396 --> 01:16:17,331
is Kanagawa 3059.

834
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,335
But the plates may have
been changed.

835
01:16:21,403 --> 01:16:26,340
Vehicle Theft is making a
through search.

836
01:16:30,412 --> 01:16:33,347
All right. Next, the 1,000-yen
notes.

837
01:16:36,418 --> 01:16:41,355
We made copies of the
numerical lists...

838
01:16:42,424 --> 01:16:46,360
for tobacco shops, cafes, and
movie theaters.

839
01:16:46,428 --> 01:16:51,365
They're helping out of sympathy
for Mr. Gondo...

840
01:16:52,434 --> 01:16:57,371
but none of the notes has
turned up yet.

841
01:16:59,441 --> 01:17:03,377
Next, reports from the public.

842
01:17:07,449 --> 01:17:12,386
We've received 1,305 reports
of sightings.

843
01:17:14,456 --> 01:17:18,392
Almost all from genuinely
concerned citizens

844
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:24,399
All reported seeing men with
boys Shinichi's age.

845
01:17:25,467 --> 01:17:31,406
But half the sightings were before
he was kidnapped...

846
01:17:31,473 --> 01:17:33,407
or after he was found.

847
01:17:34,476 --> 01:17:38,412
And he was seen simultaneously...

848
01:17:39,481 --> 01:17:43,417
in many different places.

849
01:17:43,485 --> 01:17:46,420
Still, we're checking.

850
01:17:46,488 --> 01:17:49,423
Today we heard...

851
01:17:51,493 --> 01:17:54,428
from a turnpike toll collector

852
01:17:54,496 --> 01:17:57,431
About 7:00p. M,

853
01:17:57,499 --> 01:18:00,434
a man with dark glasses
drove up.

854
01:18:00,502 --> 01:18:04,438
A boy was sleeping under
a blanket...

855
01:18:04,506 --> 01:18:06,440
on the back seat.

856
01:18:06,508 --> 01:18:10,444
The car was dark. He couldn't
see his face...

857
01:18:10,512 --> 01:18:16,451
but he did see a toy rifle and
a cowboy hat.

858
01:18:17,519 --> 01:18:20,454
<i>He took the seaside turnoff.</i>

859
01:18:21,523 --> 01:18:24,458
This could be our man.

860
01:18:25,527 --> 01:18:29,463
We're rechecking all reports
from that area.

861
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:35,769
Next, the bullet train.

862
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,776
It isn't that different from other
express trains.

863
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:47,781
<i>He knows every detail of it...</i>

864
01:18:47,849 --> 01:18:50,784
<i>but that may not mean...</i>

865
01:18:50,852 --> 01:18:52,786
<i>he's a railroad man.</i>

866
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:55,789
<i>But we checked...</i>

867
01:18:55,857 --> 01:18:58,792
<i>the bullet train personnel...</i>

868
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:01,795
who were absent that day...

869
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:04,798
or who had quit recently.

870
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:10,804
There were very few.

871
01:19:11,873 --> 01:19:15,809
I'll have all the data soon.

872
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,816
Next, grudges or other motives.

873
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:28,822
I saw the executives at
National Shoes.

874
01:19:31,893 --> 01:19:34,828
What a gruesome lot.

875
01:19:36,898 --> 01:19:38,832
A grudge?

876
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:43,837
Do you think...

877
01:19:43,905 --> 01:19:48,842
we were behind the kidnapping?

878
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,844
Absurd.

879
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:54,848
We went to join forces with him.

880
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:56,850
What a narrow escape.

881
01:19:56,918 --> 01:20:02,857
Until Kawanishi told us,
we had no idea.

882
01:20:02,924 --> 01:20:04,858
Served him right.

883
01:20:04,926 --> 01:20:08,862
He tried to buy up enough stock
to gain control...

884
01:20:08,930 --> 01:20:10,864
and then this happened.

885
01:20:10,932 --> 01:20:13,867
Poetic justice, huh?

886
01:20:15,937 --> 01:20:18,872
It's not that I doubt you...

887
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:23,877
but you've known Mr. Gondo
a long time.

888
01:20:23,945 --> 01:20:25,879
I just wondered...

889
01:20:25,947 --> 01:20:29,883
if anyone held a grudge
against him.

890
01:20:29,951 --> 01:20:31,885
Anyone?

891
01:20:31,953 --> 01:20:34,888
You couldn't count them all.

892
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:38,892
One more question.

893
01:20:39,961 --> 01:20:44,898
The kidnapping occurred just
after you left his home.

894
01:20:44,966 --> 01:20:49,903
Did you notice anything
near the gate?

895
01:20:49,971 --> 01:20:51,905
A car, for instance...

896
01:20:51,973 --> 01:20:54,908
or a suspicious-Iooking man?

897
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:57,911
We'd just been thrown out.

898
01:20:57,979 --> 01:21:00,914
We weren't admiring the view.

899
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:04,918
They were no help.

900
01:21:06,988 --> 01:21:09,923
But at the factory...

901
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:14,928
Mr. Gondo has a temper that
sure can rip into you.

902
01:21:15,997 --> 01:21:20,934
But he keeps na eye on the
work, all right.

903
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:23,937
A fine boss to good workers.

904
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:26,940
No one here...

905
01:21:28,009 --> 01:21:31,945
holds a grudge against him...

906
01:21:32,013 --> 01:21:34,948
except maybe the front office.

907
01:21:36,017 --> 01:21:41,956
I don't think anyone holds a
grudge against Mr. Gondo.

908
01:21:43,024 --> 01:21:44,958
Except the big shots.

909
01:21:45,026 --> 01:21:47,961
They'd decorate the kidnapper.

910
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:49,963
Your blood pressure, Taguchi.

911
01:21:54,035 --> 01:21:57,971
Now for the results of
our meeting.

912
01:22:00,041 --> 01:22:01,975
Inspector Tokura.

913
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:14,988
So far, this case sounds almost
impossible to break.

914
01:22:15,056 --> 01:22:18,992
But we've got to find that
"almost".

915
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:21,995
Follow every lead through to
the bitterest end.

916
01:22:23,064 --> 01:22:27,000
And when you're worn out
and discouraged...

917
01:22:31,072 --> 01:22:34,007
think of Mr. Gondo's pain.

918
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:41,014
Take the boy...

919
01:22:41,082 --> 01:22:44,017
and drive to the shore
tomorrow.

920
01:22:45,086 --> 01:22:48,021
Find this "Fuji and the sea"
scene.

921
01:22:48,089 --> 01:22:52,025
If you can jog his memory, you
may find the hideout.

922
01:22:57,098 --> 01:22:59,032
Division three.

923
01:23:05,106 --> 01:23:07,040
Hello. Tokura speaking.

924
01:23:10,111 --> 01:23:13,046
We'll be there right away.

925
01:23:13,114 --> 01:23:15,048
Don't touch anything.

926
01:23:17,118 --> 01:23:20,053
They found the car.

927
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:24,057
Abandoned on a highway.
Get the lab.

928
01:23:26,127 --> 01:23:28,061
Have more men sleep
over here...

929
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:30,063
the rest on call.

930
01:23:51,086 --> 01:23:55,022
Mud-spattered, but there's
been no rain lately.

931
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:58,025
It's dust that settled on
drops of water.

932
01:24:25,186 --> 01:24:27,120
What's this?

933
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:30,123
- What's wrong?
- Listen to this!

934
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:39,132
<i>Hello. This is Gondo.</i>

935
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:44,137
<i>The boy's fine. I'll let him</i>
<i>talk to you.</i>

936
01:24:44,205 --> 01:24:46,139
<i>Daddy? Are you there?</i>

937
01:24:52,213 --> 01:24:54,147
Hear that? A trolley.

938
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:10,163
So?

939
01:25:10,231 --> 01:25:13,166
A trolley runs near the
hideout.

940
01:25:14,235 --> 01:25:18,171
Three different trolley lines...

941
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:21,174
run through Kamakura.

942
01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:26,179
Maybe a specialist can tell
which streetcar it is.

943
01:25:26,247 --> 01:25:28,181
I'm on my way.

944
01:25:30,251 --> 01:25:32,185
An Enoshima trolley?

945
01:25:32,253 --> 01:25:35,188
Absolutely. I live near there.

946
01:25:35,256 --> 01:25:37,190
I've heard that sound...

947
01:25:38,259 --> 01:25:41,194
a million times.

948
01:25:41,262 --> 01:25:45,198
It's an old single-wire trolley.

949
01:25:45,266 --> 01:25:49,202
Only the Enoshima line uses
those old lines.

950
01:25:50,271 --> 01:25:52,205
There are lots of curves...

951
01:25:53,274 --> 01:25:56,209
and the rails are narrow.

952
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:59,212
The wheel base is short, so it
makes that noise.

953
01:26:04,552 --> 01:26:06,486
Thanks.

954
01:26:07,155 --> 01:26:09,089
Is Mr. Aoki in?

955
01:26:09,157 --> 01:26:11,091
I'm sorry. He's out.

956
01:26:11,159 --> 01:26:14,094
At your husband's office?

957
01:26:14,162 --> 01:26:16,096
No.

958
01:26:19,567 --> 01:26:21,501
Where?

959
01:26:21,569 --> 01:26:24,504
He took Shinichi in the car.

960
01:26:24,572 --> 01:26:29,509
He wants to make him remember.

961
01:26:38,586 --> 01:26:41,521
He's a nuisance.

962
01:26:41,589 --> 01:26:44,524
He just felt he had to do
something.

963
01:27:19,694 --> 01:27:21,628
You were let out here?

964
01:27:21,696 --> 01:27:23,630
We came that way.

965
01:27:26,701 --> 01:27:29,636
Good. You look out the back.

966
01:27:29,704 --> 01:27:32,639
Tell me if you remember
anything.

967
01:27:43,718 --> 01:27:45,652
Now what?

968
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,655
We can't move without the boy.

969
01:27:48,723 --> 01:27:50,657
Aoki will go to the
Sakawa River.

970
01:27:50,725 --> 01:27:52,659
Let's follow him.

971
01:28:01,736 --> 01:28:03,670
Daddy!

972
01:28:03,738 --> 01:28:06,673
What? Remember something?

973
01:28:07,742 --> 01:28:09,676
I peed there.

974
01:28:16,751 --> 01:28:21,688
We'll find Aoki's car and
get the boy.

975
01:28:21,756 --> 01:28:23,690
<i>Wait, bos'n.</i>

976
01:28:23,758 --> 01:28:25,692
<i>The lab says...</i>

977
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:30,697
<i>there's fish oil and blood...</i>

978
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:35,702
<i>bonito and mackerel scales</i>
<i>on the stolen car.</i>

979
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:38,705
<i>It must have gone through a
<i>puddle of refuse...</i>

980
01:28:38,773 --> 01:28:41,708
<i>from a fish market.</i>

981
01:28:41,776 --> 01:28:47,715
<i>The Koshigoe market is the only</i>
<i>one near that trolley.</i>

982
01:28:48,783 --> 01:28:50,717
Got it.

983
01:28:58,793 --> 01:29:03,730
We get bonito and mackerel
around here

984
01:29:04,799 --> 01:29:07,734
And other types of fish...

985
01:29:07,802 --> 01:29:10,737
come by truck from Tokyo.

986
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:19,746
Thanks. Where does the
trolley run?

987
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:27,754
Under the cliff.

988
01:29:30,825 --> 01:29:33,760
Does it look like this from
up there?

989
01:29:33,828 --> 01:29:35,762
Let's see.

990
01:29:37,832 --> 01:29:41,768
You should see Enoshima
Island from there...

991
01:29:43,838 --> 01:29:47,774
a little more to the right,
near the station.

992
01:29:52,847 --> 01:29:57,784
With that cape in front, it must
look like this.

993
01:30:04,859 --> 01:30:06,793
You saw Enoshima Island?

994
01:30:08,863 --> 01:30:10,797
You must have.

995
01:30:10,865 --> 01:30:12,799
We didn't come this way.

996
01:30:27,882 --> 01:30:31,818
Bos'n, I feel we're getting
closer.

997
01:30:33,888 --> 01:30:37,824
Up there. Try no to look
like a cop.

998
01:30:38,893 --> 01:30:43,830
Okay, but you'll need plastic
surgery not to.

999
01:30:47,902 --> 01:30:50,837
Daddy! I saw this tunnel!

1000
01:30:51,906 --> 01:30:53,840
You passed here?

1001
01:30:53,908 --> 01:30:55,842
Which way?

1002
01:30:56,911 --> 01:30:58,845
From there.

1003
01:31:47,828 --> 01:31:49,762
Here, Shinichi?

1004
01:32:02,843 --> 01:32:04,777
Look.

1005
01:32:05,846 --> 01:32:07,780
Enoshima doesn't look
like an Island.

1006
01:32:08,849 --> 01:32:10,783
Let's go back to Koshigoe.

1007
01:32:10,851 --> 01:32:13,786
They'll have Aoki by now.

1008
01:32:13,854 --> 01:32:17,790
The boy will show us that
hideout.

1009
01:32:17,858 --> 01:32:19,792
We'll raid tonight.

1010
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:21,794
Got your pistol?

1011
01:32:21,862 --> 01:32:24,797
I'm not going after a madman
with my bare hands.

1012
01:32:30,871 --> 01:32:32,805
Let's look around on foot.

1013
01:32:41,882 --> 01:32:43,816
That car!

1014
01:32:43,884 --> 01:32:45,818
It's Gondo's.

1015
01:33:02,837 --> 01:33:05,772
Don't be stupid. Stop playing
detective.

1016
01:33:14,849 --> 01:33:19,786
When I got the car out this
morning, he said...

1017
01:33:20,855 --> 01:33:25,792
"Aoki, we aren't going to the
factory anymore".

1018
01:33:27,862 --> 01:33:30,797
He was smiling...

1019
01:33:30,865 --> 01:33:33,800
but I know how he felt inside.

1020
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:37,804
Those executives are cruel...

1021
01:33:39,874 --> 01:33:42,809
but it's really my fault.

1022
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:50,817
But you can't walk around
here with the boy.

1023
01:33:52,887 --> 01:33:55,822
What if the kidnapper saw him?

1024
01:33:59,894 --> 01:34:01,828
Bos'n! He's gone!

1025
01:34:08,903 --> 01:34:10,837
Daddy!

1026
01:34:11,906 --> 01:34:13,840
Here it is!

1027
01:34:30,925 --> 01:34:32,859
They're asleep.

1028
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:11,964
Take the boy away.

1029
01:35:12,032 --> 01:35:13,966
They're dead.

1030
01:35:52,072 --> 01:35:54,006
The inspector will explain.

1031
01:35:54,074 --> 01:35:58,010
Yes, but we're asking you
not to print it.

1032
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,014
The accomplices...

1033
01:36:03,083 --> 01:36:07,019
a man and a woman, were
found dead.

1034
01:36:09,089 --> 01:36:11,023
Heroin overdose.

1035
01:36:11,091 --> 01:36:13,025
Suicide?

1036
01:36:13,093 --> 01:36:15,027
I'll explain.

1037
01:36:18,098 --> 01:36:23,035
Their arms were covered with
needle marks.

1038
01:36:23,103 --> 01:36:26,038
Both were advanced cases
of drug addiction.

1039
01:36:27,107 --> 01:36:30,042
It's unlikely they'd make
a mistake...

1040
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:33,045
in the dosage.

1041
01:36:33,113 --> 01:36:38,050
And dealers don't sell heroin
that pure anyway.

1042
01:36:38,118 --> 01:36:42,054
They died in bed.

1043
01:36:43,123 --> 01:36:45,057
Near their pillows...

1044
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:49,061
were two empty packets
and syringes...

1045
01:36:49,129 --> 01:36:53,065
and a cup for dissolving
the heroin.

1046
01:36:55,135 --> 01:37:01,074
There were two more used
packets nearby.

1047
01:37:02,142 --> 01:37:05,077
So they had four...

1048
01:37:05,145 --> 01:37:09,081
and had taken the first two.

1049
01:37:09,149 --> 01:37:12,084
It doesn't suggest suicide.

1050
01:37:14,154 --> 01:37:17,089
Then why did they die?

1051
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:25,097
The heroin was unusually pure.

1052
01:37:28,168 --> 01:37:32,104
What they took was over
90% pure.

1053
01:37:32,172 --> 01:37:35,107
When it's smuggled in...

1054
01:37:36,176 --> 01:37:39,111
it's 70% to 95% pure.

1055
01:37:40,147 --> 01:37:43,082
The dealers cut it...

1056
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:47,086
with glucose and hydrochloric
procaine...

1057
01:37:47,154 --> 01:37:51,090
till it's only 30% pure.

1058
01:37:52,126 --> 01:37:54,060
A one-gram package...

1059
01:37:54,128 --> 01:37:58,064
contains only 0.3 grams
of pure heroin.

1060
01:37:59,133 --> 01:38:02,068
What happens to na addict...

1061
01:38:03,137 --> 01:38:06,072
Who takes heroin that pure?

1062
01:38:08,142 --> 01:38:11,077
A very clever murder.

1063
01:38:13,147 --> 01:38:16,082
Here's important evidence.

1064
01:38:16,150 --> 01:38:19,085
It was found in their room.

1065
01:38:20,154 --> 01:38:22,088
The imprint...

1066
01:38:22,156 --> 01:38:27,093
of what they'd scribbled on
the page above.

1067
01:38:36,236 --> 01:38:42,175
It's been restored and
enlarged.

1068
01:38:43,243 --> 01:38:45,177
It shows the agony...

1069
01:38:45,245 --> 01:38:48,180
of an addiction withdrawal.

1070
01:38:49,249 --> 01:38:52,184
<i>"Bring us the stuff. Fast.</i>

1071
01:38:52,252 --> 01:38:56,188
<i>"If you don't, we'll spend</i>
<i>the money.</i>

1072
01:38:56,256 --> 01:38:59,191
<i>"We won't do what you say</i>
<i>anymore."</i>

1073
01:39:04,264 --> 01:39:07,199
Obviously, they tried to
blackmail him.

1074
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:12,204
We can't be sure...

1075
01:39:12,272 --> 01:39:15,207
but it looks like he
killed them.

1076
01:39:15,275 --> 01:39:17,209
And the money?

1077
01:39:17,277 --> 01:39:22,214
We found 2,500 of Mr. Gondo's
1,000-yen notes.

1078
01:39:23,283 --> 01:39:26,218
The kidnapper figured that
out too.

1079
01:39:27,287 --> 01:39:30,222
He gave them a share...

1080
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:34,226
but made them wait to used it.

1081
01:39:35,295 --> 01:39:37,229
Who were they?

1082
01:39:37,297 --> 01:39:40,232
Caretakers of a villa.

1083
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:45,237
We found that out from the
villa owner.

1084
01:39:46,306 --> 01:39:49,241
So you're close?

1085
01:39:49,309 --> 01:39:52,244
No, now we have to start
all over again.

1086
01:39:52,312 --> 01:39:57,249
Of course, narcotics is
doing its best.

1087
01:39:57,317 --> 01:40:00,252
We'll get valuable data
from them...

1088
01:40:01,321 --> 01:40:04,256
but the accomplices' death...

1089
01:40:04,324 --> 01:40:08,260
is a great setback for us.

1090
01:40:08,328 --> 01:40:13,265
The line leading straight to the
kidnapper has been cut.

1091
01:40:17,337 --> 01:40:20,272
So I'm asking you:

1092
01:40:21,341 --> 01:40:25,277
Don't print a word of all this.

1093
01:40:26,346 --> 01:40:28,280
Why not?

1094
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:36,289
The kidnapper doesn't know
they're dead yet.

1095
01:40:37,357 --> 01:40:40,292
If he did...

1096
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:44,296
he wouldn't have left all that
money there.

1097
01:40:45,365 --> 01:40:47,299
What'll he do...

1098
01:40:47,367 --> 01:40:52,304
if we convince him they're
still alive?

1099
01:40:53,373 --> 01:40:59,312
He'll probably try to kill
them again.

1100
01:41:00,380 --> 01:41:06,319
So you don't report anything.

1101
01:41:06,386 --> 01:41:09,321
He'll go back to check.

1102
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:12,324
And you'll arrest him there?

1103
01:41:12,392 --> 01:41:13,324
Right.

1104
01:41:13,393 --> 01:41:17,329
Even if we keep quiet...

1105
01:41:17,397 --> 01:41:20,332
the neighbors will talk.

1106
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,334
It's a new development.

1107
01:41:22,402 --> 01:41:24,336
There aren't many houses.

1108
01:41:24,404 --> 01:41:31,333
And it's off-season. Hardly
anyone's there now.

1109
01:41:32,412 --> 01:41:35,347
Drug addicts are cautious.

1110
01:41:35,415 --> 01:41:38,350
They had no visitors.

1111
01:41:39,419 --> 01:41:44,356
Our keeping quiet will
convince him?

1112
01:41:46,426 --> 01:41:50,362
No, I want to ask you
another favor.

1113
01:41:52,432 --> 01:41:58,371
Print that one of the 1,000-yen
notes was spent.

1114
01:42:00,440 --> 01:42:04,376
Say it's our announcement.

1115
01:42:06,446 --> 01:42:11,383
I'm asking your cooperation for
Mr. Gondo's sake too.

1116
01:42:13,453 --> 01:42:19,392
Did you know he lost his post
at National Shoes?

1117
01:42:21,461 --> 01:42:24,396
That's bad. Don't they care
about public opinion?

1118
01:42:24,464 --> 01:42:28,400
They'll vote him completely out
of the firm soon.

1119
01:42:28,468 --> 01:42:35,397
I think we ought to give National
Shoes a whack.

1120
01:42:39,479 --> 01:42:42,414
Let's do it.

1121
01:42:46,486 --> 01:42:49,421
<i>"Gondo shut out public</i>
<i>opinion ignored"</i>

1122
01:42:49,489 --> 01:42:53,425
<i>"Women start boycott of</i>
<i>National Shoes"</i>

1123
01:42:54,494 --> 01:42:58,430
<i>"Second tragedy Gondo</i>
<i>voted out"</i>

1124
01:43:07,507 --> 01:43:10,442
<i>"Marked 1,000-yen note found"</i>

1125
01:43:16,516 --> 01:43:20,452
<i>"30 million Ransom in this</i>
<i>Briefcase"</i>

1126
01:45:02,622 --> 01:45:05,557
We've recovered 2.5 million.

1127
01:45:06,626 --> 01:45:09,561
Will you come for it?

1128
01:45:09,629 --> 01:45:12,564
Sorry it's so late.

1129
01:45:12,632 --> 01:45:14,566
No, it's a great help now.

1130
01:45:15,635 --> 01:45:19,571
We want it all back.

1131
01:45:19,639 --> 01:45:22,574
The kidnapper hasn't spent any.

1132
01:45:22,642 --> 01:45:26,578
But he'll be hard to catch
unless he does. Ironic.

1133
01:45:27,647 --> 01:45:29,581
Mr. Kawanishi is here.

1134
01:45:29,649 --> 01:45:32,584
Kawanishi? What for?

1135
01:45:32,652 --> 01:45:34,586
A request.

1136
01:45:36,656 --> 01:45:38,590
Send him in.

1137
01:45:45,665 --> 01:45:47,599
Nice to see you.

1138
01:45:48,668 --> 01:45:50,602
I must thank you.

1139
01:45:50,670 --> 01:45:55,607
You've made Mr. Gondo a hero.

1140
01:45:55,675 --> 01:45:57,609
Now what?

1141
01:45:58,678 --> 01:46:01,613
Don't be so cold.

1142
01:46:01,681 --> 01:46:05,617
We've been so close all
these years.

1143
01:46:05,685 --> 01:46:08,620
I objected to your being fired.

1144
01:46:08,688 --> 01:46:11,623
I risked my own position...

1145
01:46:11,691 --> 01:46:13,625
to keep you as an executive.

1146
01:46:15,695 --> 01:46:17,629
The Old Man's stubborn...

1147
01:46:18,698 --> 01:46:21,633
and the executive are schemers.

1148
01:46:21,701 --> 01:46:24,636
I had a hard time.

1149
01:46:24,704 --> 01:46:27,639
Fortunately, public opinion
is for you.

1150
01:46:27,707 --> 01:46:30,642
So I succeeded.

1151
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:34,646
Get out! Tell your new
master for me:

1152
01:46:34,714 --> 01:46:37,649
You can't use me to save
your hides.

1153
01:46:38,718 --> 01:46:40,652
I won't be an executive with
no power.

1154
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,654
I'm no puppet.

1155
01:46:46,726 --> 01:46:49,661
Can you afford to say that?

1156
01:46:49,729 --> 01:46:51,663
You went too far.

1157
01:46:51,731 --> 01:46:56,668
If you quit now, you'll have
only debts.

1158
01:46:56,736 --> 01:47:00,672
Back on the payroll, your
credit stands.

1159
01:47:00,740 --> 01:47:02,674
Get out!

1160
01:47:02,742 --> 01:47:05,677
I'm my own man now.

1161
01:47:05,745 --> 01:47:08,680
You're nothing not
even a man.

1162
01:47:34,774 --> 01:47:36,708
Excuse me.

1163
01:47:37,777 --> 01:47:40,712
I'd like you to see something.

1164
01:47:42,782 --> 01:47:48,721
It's not much, but the last one
seemed to be of use.

1165
01:47:49,789 --> 01:47:53,725
Shinichi drew it
the kidnapper.

1166
01:47:54,794 --> 01:47:58,730
Dark glasses and a mask.
Not much to identify.

1167
01:47:59,799 --> 01:48:01,733
What's this?

1168
01:48:01,801 --> 01:48:05,737
A handkerchief. He always
wore it.

1169
01:48:07,807 --> 01:48:12,744
Mom! Look at the pretty
pink smoke!

1170
01:48:24,824 --> 01:48:28,760
Burn anything here about
9:00 a. M?

1171
01:48:30,830 --> 01:48:33,765
Yes, yesterday's trash.

1172
01:48:33,833 --> 01:48:39,772
What do you burn?

1173
01:48:39,839 --> 01:48:43,775
Junk that can't be disinfected.

1174
01:48:43,843 --> 01:48:46,778
They even bring stuff that
won't burn.

1175
01:48:47,847 --> 01:48:49,781
Who does?

1176
01:48:49,849 --> 01:48:51,783
The janitors.

1177
01:48:51,851 --> 01:48:53,785
Anyone else?

1178
01:48:54,854 --> 01:48:59,791
The hospital nurses and
attendants, sometimes.

1179
01:49:00,794 --> 01:49:02,728
Anyone like that today?

1180
01:49:03,797 --> 01:49:05,731
Come to think of it...

1181
01:49:05,799 --> 01:49:09,735
a man brought a cardboard box.

1182
01:49:10,804 --> 01:49:12,738
How big?

1183
01:49:13,807 --> 01:49:15,741
Know him?

1184
01:49:15,809 --> 01:49:18,744
No. An intern maybe.

1185
01:49:18,812 --> 01:49:20,746
A young man?

1186
01:49:20,814 --> 01:49:25,751
Yes. Too young to be a
regular doctor.

1187
01:49:26,820 --> 01:49:29,755
"Burn this, pop," he said.

1188
01:49:29,823 --> 01:49:32,758
Doctors don't talk like that.

1189
01:49:33,827 --> 01:49:36,762
Now look at that, will you?

1190
01:49:40,834 --> 01:49:43,769
You can't burn tin.

1191
01:49:48,875 --> 01:49:51,810
You know what section he's in?

1192
01:49:52,879 --> 01:49:57,816
No, but he headed toward
Internal medicine.

1193
01:50:56,976 --> 01:51:02,915
Bos'n's report says his name
is Ginjiro Takeuchi.

1194
01:51:03,983 --> 01:51:07,919
He took three days off during
the kidnapping.

1195
01:51:11,991 --> 01:51:17,930
He lives in a studio apartment
in Nishi-ku.

1196
01:51:18,998 --> 01:51:25,927
His room faces north and looks
up at Gondo's house.

1197
01:51:27,006 --> 01:51:29,941
One of the phones we marked...

1198
01:51:30,009 --> 01:51:34,946
is near his apartment.

1199
01:51:37,016 --> 01:51:39,951
The accomplices had been
examined...

1200
01:51:40,019 --> 01:51:43,955
at his hospital.

1201
01:51:45,024 --> 01:51:49,961
They were lung patients and
drug addicts...

1202
01:51:50,029 --> 01:51:52,964
suffering from edema of
the lungs...

1203
01:51:53,032 --> 01:51:55,967
and heroin withdrawal.

1204
01:51:56,035 --> 01:51:59,971
Pure heroin would cause death
from shock.

1205
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:04,976
Takeuchi's name was on their
medical reports.

1206
01:52:06,045 --> 01:52:09,981
We can conclude that he
is the kidnapper.

1207
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:13,985
But we can't arrest him.

1208
01:52:18,057 --> 01:52:19,991
If we arrest him now...

1209
01:52:20,059 --> 01:52:22,994
he'll only get 15 years.

1210
01:52:24,063 --> 01:52:29,000
But he gave Mr. Gondo, who
paid the ransom...

1211
01:52:29,068 --> 01:52:31,002
a life sentence.

1212
01:52:31,070 --> 01:52:34,005
We can't allow that.

1213
01:52:35,074 --> 01:52:42,003
The kidnapper deserves capital
punishment.

1214
01:52:43,082 --> 01:52:47,018
It's clear he killed his
accomplices...

1215
01:52:47,086 --> 01:52:49,020
but if we arrest him now...

1216
01:52:49,088 --> 01:52:52,023
we can't prove it.

1217
01:52:52,091 --> 01:52:58,030
There's only one way to bring
him to justice.

1218
01:52:59,098 --> 01:53:02,033
Let him reconstruct his crime.

1219
01:53:04,103 --> 01:53:06,037
How?

1220
01:53:09,108 --> 01:53:11,042
With this.

1221
01:53:11,110 --> 01:53:13,044
Lower the blinds.

1222
01:53:25,124 --> 01:53:28,059
<i>"Give us more stuff. We'll</i>
<i>talk if you don't".</i>

1223
01:53:28,127 --> 01:53:31,062
<i>Not a bad imitation, huh?</i>

1224
01:53:44,143 --> 01:53:46,077
Mr. Takeuchi?

1225
01:54:26,185 --> 01:54:28,119
He'll start moving today.

1226
01:54:30,189 --> 01:54:33,124
First, he'll have to buy
heroin.

1227
01:54:35,194 --> 01:54:40,131
When he gets it, he'll try to
kill them again.

1228
01:54:40,199 --> 01:54:43,134
But what he does till then...

1229
01:54:45,204 --> 01:54:49,140
and how he gets the drugs...

1230
01:54:49,208 --> 01:54:54,145
we can only find out by
watching him.

1231
01:54:56,215 --> 01:55:00,151
Don't get too close...

1232
01:55:01,220 --> 01:55:04,155
but don't take your eyes
off him.

1233
01:55:04,223 --> 01:55:07,158
Bos'n, Nakao, Ari and I...

1234
01:55:07,226 --> 01:55:10,161
Will head for the hideout when
he goes after the drugs.

1235
01:55:10,229 --> 01:55:13,164
I'll give orders from the car.

1236
01:55:42,261 --> 01:55:45,196
He's waiting for a dealer?

1237
01:55:45,264 --> 01:55:48,199
<i>Just killing time, I'd say.</i>

1238
01:56:58,337 --> 01:57:02,273
<i>Walking up and down for</i>
<i>two hours already.</i>

1239
01:57:02,341 --> 01:57:05,276
<i>He may recognize us if we</i>
<i>stick together.</i>

1240
01:57:55,394 --> 01:57:57,328
Inspector!

1241
01:57:57,396 --> 01:57:59,330
Yes. Tokura here.

1242
01:57:59,398 --> 01:58:01,332
<i>He's in a florist's.</i>

1243
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:05,336
What? Flowers? Have someone
buy some flowers.

1244
01:58:07,406 --> 01:58:10,341
There's no face here fit to
buy flowers.

1245
01:58:20,419 --> 01:58:22,353
He bought one carnation?

1246
01:58:22,421 --> 01:58:24,355
<i>Yes. One red one.</i>

1247
01:58:24,423 --> 01:58:26,357
A girlfriend?

1248
01:58:39,438 --> 01:58:44,375
Now the suspect is at a
pay phone.

1249
01:58:44,443 --> 01:58:48,379
It must be his connection...

1250
01:58:49,448 --> 01:58:51,382
and the flower must be a sign.

1251
01:59:02,461 --> 01:59:05,396
<i>Watch who approaches the</i>
<i>red carnation.</i>

1252
01:59:06,465 --> 01:59:11,402
Watch how the money and
dope change hands.

1253
02:04:32,958 --> 02:04:34,892
<i>Inspector Tokura!</i>

1254
02:04:34,960 --> 02:04:36,894
Tokura speaking.

1255
02:04:36,962 --> 02:04:38,896
<i>He changed his course.</i>

1256
02:04:38,964 --> 02:04:40,898
<i>He got out at Dope Alley.</i>

1257
02:04:40,966 --> 02:04:43,901
Didn't he buy any?

1258
02:04:43,969 --> 02:04:45,903
<i>We thought he did.</i>

1259
02:04:45,971 --> 02:04:49,907
We're turning back. Watch him.

1260
02:05:51,036 --> 02:05:53,971
What are you looking at?

1261
02:05:54,039 --> 02:05:55,973
Get out!

1262
02:05:56,041 --> 02:05:57,975
What are you doing here?

1263
02:06:06,051 --> 02:06:09,987
A lot of strangers around
tonight. Be careful.

1264
02:06:10,055 --> 02:06:12,990
<i>What are you, a cop?</i>

1265
02:06:13,058 --> 02:06:14,992
We don't know you.

1266
02:06:16,061 --> 02:06:18,996
Get out. Get out, I said!

1267
02:09:01,226 --> 02:09:05,162
Bos'n, I don't understand
what he's up to.

1268
02:09:05,230 --> 02:09:09,166
He should be taking the dope
to the hideout.

1269
02:09:11,236 --> 02:09:16,173
And if he hasn't got it yet,
why go to the junkies?

1270
02:09:16,241 --> 02:09:19,176
They don't have any pure
heroin.

1271
02:09:19,244 --> 02:09:21,178
<i>- Inspector!</i>
- This is Tokura.

1272
02:09:21,246 --> 02:09:24,181
<i>He picked up a girl.</i>

1273
02:09:38,263 --> 02:09:41,198
"HOTEL"

1274
02:09:48,273 --> 02:09:53,210
Oh, no! He'll use her as a
guinea pig!

1275
02:09:53,278 --> 02:09:58,215
He wants to test the drug
he's got.

1276
02:10:32,317 --> 02:10:34,251
<i>He came out.</i>

1277
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:37,254
- And the girl?
<i>- One moment.</i>

1278
02:10:37,322 --> 02:10:39,256
<i>Two men went to check.</i>

1279
02:10:40,325 --> 02:10:42,259
On to the hideout?

1280
02:10:42,327 --> 02:10:47,264
Wait. The girl's a clue as to
what he'll do.

1281
02:10:47,332 --> 02:10:50,267
<i>He's going to Isezaki-cho.</i>

1282
02:10:50,335 --> 02:10:53,270
This is Isezaki-cho.
Which side?

1283
02:10:53,338 --> 02:10:55,272
<i>Left side.</i>

1284
02:10:57,342 --> 02:11:00,277
- Stop!
- No standing, sir.

1285
02:11:01,346 --> 02:11:07,285
<i>The girl's dead. Overdose.</i>

1286
02:11:07,352 --> 02:11:09,286
He's coming.

1287
02:11:11,356 --> 02:11:14,291
We found him. I'm cutting
off the radio.

1288
02:12:37,442 --> 02:12:41,378
A real prize.
To the hideout.

1289
02:12:41,446 --> 02:12:43,380
No standing.

1290
02:14:41,333 --> 02:14:44,268
I brought the stuff.

1291
02:14:46,338 --> 02:14:49,273
Takeuchi, you're a dead man.

1292
02:15:16,368 --> 02:15:19,303
We recovered 27,480,000 yen.

1293
02:15:19,371 --> 02:15:25,310
He had spent only 20,000 yen
on the heroin.

1294
02:15:25,377 --> 02:15:27,311
It's a great help.

1295
02:15:45,397 --> 02:15:47,331
- Too late?
- It's all right.

1296
02:15:47,399 --> 02:15:49,333
Have a seat.

1297
02:16:05,417 --> 02:16:09,353
You can use them till
the auction.

1298
02:16:54,165 --> 02:16:57,100
"Attached Article"

1299
02:16:57,168 --> 02:17:01,104
"Kidnapper Gets Death
Sentence"

1300
02:17:06,244 --> 02:17:08,178
Thank you for coming.

1301
02:17:09,247 --> 02:17:13,183
He refuses to see a priest.

1302
02:17:13,251 --> 02:17:16,186
But he insisted on seeing you.

1303
02:18:08,306 --> 02:18:11,241
Well, Mr. Gondo. Thanks
for coming.

1304
02:18:36,568 --> 02:18:38,502
You seem well.

1305
02:18:42,574 --> 02:18:45,509
What are you doing now?

1306
02:18:46,578 --> 02:18:48,512
Making shoes again...

1307
02:18:50,582 --> 02:18:54,518
for a small company, but I'm
in charge.

1308
02:18:55,587 --> 02:19:00,524
I'm trying to make it as good
as National Shoes.

1309
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:10,534
Why do you look at me
like that?

1310
02:19:11,603 --> 02:19:15,539
I'm going to die, but I'm
not afraid.

1311
02:19:15,607 --> 02:19:18,542
So you needn't feel
sorry for me.

1312
02:19:20,612 --> 02:19:22,546
That's why I refused a priest.

1313
02:19:23,615 --> 02:19:28,552
I should repent, pray for mercy,
ask forgiveness.

1314
02:19:31,623 --> 02:19:33,557
But why?

1315
02:19:33,625 --> 02:19:38,562
I have no time for lies.
I want the truth.

1316
02:19:49,641 --> 02:19:54,578
Are you glad because I'm
going to die?

1317
02:19:56,648 --> 02:19:58,582
No?

1318
02:19:59,651 --> 02:20:04,588
Why should you and I hate
each other?

1319
02:20:04,656 --> 02:20:06,590
I don't know.

1320
02:20:07,659 --> 02:20:10,594
I'm not interested in
self-analysis.

1321
02:20:12,664 --> 02:20:17,601
I do know my room was so
cold in winter...

1322
02:20:17,669 --> 02:20:23,608
and so hot in summer
I couldn't sleep.

1323
02:20:24,676 --> 02:20:28,612
Your house looked like heaven,
high up there.

1324
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:31,615
That's how I began
to hate you.

1325
02:20:37,689 --> 02:20:41,625
That gave me a purpose
in life.

1326
02:20:41,693 --> 02:20:44,628
It's interesting to make fortunate
men unfortunate.

1327
02:20:46,698 --> 02:20:49,633
Were you so unfortunate then?

1328
02:20:58,710 --> 02:21:01,645
You want my life story?

1329
02:21:02,714 --> 02:21:06,650
I'm not looking for your pity.

1330
02:21:07,719 --> 02:21:15,649
That's not why I sent for you,
Mr. Gondo.

1331
02:21:19,731 --> 02:21:22,666
Why did you then?

1332
02:21:27,739 --> 02:21:32,676
I didn't want you to think.
I died crying and afraid.

1333
02:21:49,761 --> 02:21:52,696
My hands don't tremble
because I'm nervous.

1334
02:21:52,764 --> 02:21:56,700
It's from being in solitary
so long.

1335
02:21:58,770 --> 02:22:01,705
Just being outside that cell
makes them tremble.

1336
02:22:04,776 --> 02:22:08,712
I'm not afraid of death
or hell.

1337
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:12,716
My life has been like hell
since I was born.

1338
02:22:15,787 --> 02:22:20,724
But if I had to go to heaven,
I'd really tremble.

1339
02:23:05,937 --> 02:23:14,868
THE END
