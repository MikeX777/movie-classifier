BYUN Eun-Jung KIM Min-Sun

4
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,020
- Jun!
- Huh?

00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,894
BANG Eun-Jin MYUNG Kye-Nam

6
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,400
- Do you know today's menu?
- No.

7
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,967
- I hope it's something good today.
- Yeah.

8
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,834
Hello? Oh, yeah?

9
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,766
Sorry. What about dad?

10
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,709
Mom will be home soon.

11
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,075
About 30 minutes.

12
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,049
Your kid?

13
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,431
- I have a month left.
- What?

14
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,945
I have a month until my service is up.

15
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,418
Is your kid okay?

16
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,717
No.

17
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,924
He doesn't like being alone.

18
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,660
He's a kid, you know.

19
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:38,166
Do you want to get something to eat?
A hamburger or something?

20
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,379
It won't take long...

21
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,146
I'm late.

22
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,827
Why don't you go ahead...

23
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,964
- See you.
- Bye.

24
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:19,481
Director IM Jong-Jae

25
00:05:58,925 --> 00:05:59,983
What are you doing?

26
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:06,823
Nothing.

27
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,303
Hey, when I first got here,

28
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:18,343
I heard this story from a senior officer.
Do you want to hear it?

29
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,004
What is it?

30
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,945
I don't know if it's true or not.

31
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:33,722
Because he heard it from his senior
officer when he started his service.

32
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:39,793
So his senior officer...
It was when my senior's senior officer

33
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,698
was about to get discharged.

34
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,536
Back then, they had a dawn shift.
Anyway, it was early dawn...

35
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,007
...when suddenly, he heard something.

36
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,575
It sounded like footsteps

37
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,844
or crumbling...

38
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:02,978
So he walked around the parking lot

39
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:08,256
and right where he was,
there stood a deer.

40
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:12,319
The deer stared deeply at him.
A real deer...

41
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,768
A deer, like the ones
you can only see at a zoo...

42
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,200
Jun, that's a lie, right?

43
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,378
I'm not really sure.
It's a story my senior officer heard.

44
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,421
How can a deer be in the parking lot
here? In the middle of the city,

45
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:44,087
with no zoo or mountains nearby.
That's nonsense.

46
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,471
'1 . Passports'

47
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,274
- Hi.
- Hey.

48
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,945
Long time no see.

49
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,722
Have you been well?

50
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,320
What brings you here?

51
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,460
Oh, some stuff.

52
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:25,733
- Eunji Han.
- Thank you.

53
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:36,710
- You look good in uniform.
- Really? I'm not so sure.

54
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:42,114
- Has it been long?
- Over 2 years.

55
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:47,318
- I'm almost done now.
- Oh, yeah? Good.

56
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:50,459
I didn't know you were in the service.

57
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,734
- What have you been up to?
- Huh?

58
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:04,233
- What have you been doing?
- Oh... just work.

59
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,474
Wow, you're already
part of the work force.

60
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,479
It's nothing.

61
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,414
I work here, in the parking lot.

62
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:21,321
Actually, it's not really work.
I just stand there.

63
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,322
I don't even do that much
now that I'm a senior officer.

64
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:27,860
Jun. I have to go.

65
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,098
See you.

66
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,235
Take care.

67
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,616
Who was that?

68
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,094
My ex-girlfriend.

69
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,626
' Jun's Cleaners'

70
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,906
- You know what?
- What?

71
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:54,215
I heard the car guy across the street
is opening a Whirlpool laundromat.

72
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,286
When they finish the building.

73
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,017
Really?

74
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,060
Yes.

75
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,803
Is something wrong?

76
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,403
No...

77
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,284
I ran into an old friend.

78
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,880
An old friend...
it must've been nice.

79
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,020
Well, just...

80
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:38,886
It's always nice to see
an old friend. Not long ago,

81
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:44,026
I ran into a friend who I hadn't seen in
ages. It was really nice. Lots to catch up.

82
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:49,400
- Service days, women, all sorts of stuff...
- Uh, it was a girl.

83
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:53,834
Oh, yeah?

84
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:01,883
We used to go out.
Not for long

85
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:06,121
but she seems to have changed.
She's working now.

86
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,058
Seemed busy.

87
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,862
Why did you break up?

88
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:23,869
Well...

89
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:26,804
I don't know.

90
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,615
By the way,
I'm gonna crash here tonight.

91
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,465
- Aren't you going to shower?
- Yes.

92
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,350
Come here.

00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,827
'Ellen Kim: Retrospect'

94
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,084
It's my first time here during the day.

95
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,195
- Why in the afternoon?
- I have something to tell you.

96
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,028
What is it?

97
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,440
You and me...

98
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,781
let's, let's end it now.

99
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,716
It's been too long.

100
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:52,436
- Is there anything to end?
- Don't talk like that.

101
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,372
Can you really end it with me?

102
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:02,035
Can you really?

103
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,050
I won't press you.

104
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:14,448
It's just that...

105
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:22,131
I doubt a wishy-washi person
like you can really end it.

106
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,497
Didn't you say...

107
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,834
you had no direction?

108
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,505
Nothing you want to do,
nothing you want to be.

109
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,277
Never loved.

110
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,158
- Do you have someone else?
- No.

111
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,458
Then what is it?

112
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,333
I think this is wrong.

113
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:11,772
And... I don't like you.

114
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,390
Still, don't talk like that.

115
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,323
Don't do this. I'm going.

116
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,893
We need to change the bulb.

117
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,563
Yeah. We should.

118
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,506
- Jun!
- Yes!

119
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,244
Did you take down the poster outside?

120
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,977
Yes. It kept covering our sign.

121
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:30,545
I see.

122
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:03,612
Hi.

123
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:10,586
Hi.

124
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,868
I called your house.
The number's the same.

125
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:19,970
They told me you worked here.

126
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,471
Say hello to the owner.

127
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,744
Oh, that's becoming a problem.

128
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:35,652
We should fix it.
Jun, watch the store.

129
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,379
- I'll go buy a bulb.
- Yeah.

130
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,794
I went all the way up there
looking for this place.

131
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:59,137
Not surprising.
People don't know this is a cleaners.

132
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,974
I want to do something about it

133
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,346
but I don't know
what Mister Jun's thinking.

134
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,917
Why? I like this better.

135
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:17,529
I like it here.
It's cozy and it suits you better.

136
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:23,764
- Is that a compliment or...
- It's a compliment.

137
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,864
I was always comfortable around you.

138
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:39,280
It's been a long time, right?

139
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,009
Yeah.

140
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,330
I never thought
I'd run into you like that.

141
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:00,798
And that you'd be in the service.

142
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:09,970
What are you going to do after
your discharge? Go back to school?

143
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:17,580
Well... I'm not sure yet.

144
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,588
Where do you work?

145
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:31,093
- At a TV station.
- TV station? Then are you on TV?

146
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,372
Do you think everyone
who works there is on TV?

147
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:43,071
I guess not. Still, it's great.
You're working.

148
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,175
It's not all good.

149
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:52,917
At first, it was something
I really wanted to do.

150
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:56,888
But now, I really can't stand it.

151
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:15,677
It was so nice seeing you at the office.
You haven't changed much.

152
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:20,313
And I like it here cause it's cozy.

153
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,363
This chair is quite comfy.

154
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,239
It's the newest chair here.

155
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,841
Do you know the difference between
part-time and full-time military service?

156
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:59,048
If you die serving full-time, it says 'death
of an honored soldier' on the notice.

157
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:02,393
But if you're part-time, it says 'missing.'

158
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,727
Oh, it's raining.

159
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,896
The laundry! Gotta get the laundry!

160
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:24,539
I knew this would happen.
It always rains when I hang it out.

161
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:28,179
- It's raining hard.
- Stay inside.

162
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,354
- It's okay. I'll help you.
- I can do it alone...

163
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,455
Aren't you going to bring in the laundry?

164
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:45,197
- Did you see our name?
- The name?

165
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:55,040
Are you working today?
Why are you still here?

166
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:01,508
Hey, the rain gods are here,
shall we have a drink?

167
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,953
Drink all night again?
No way, no way.

168
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,433
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

169
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:25,203
Why didn't you call back then?

170
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,839
Everything was confusing for me then.

171
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,221
And not anymore?

172
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:02,810
- I don't know what I'm gonna do yet.
- Same here.

173
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,612
Why? I envy you.

174
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,556
I better get going.
It's raining too much.

175
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,347
Do you want a ride on my bike?
To the bus stop?

176
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,886
Do you want to come by
the station sometime?

177
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,287
- When you get a chance?
- Sure.

178
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,090
Bye.

179
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:14,942
'Sign up book: Jun Kim'

180
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,482
Standby. Five minutes.

181
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,856
Good morning!

182
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:30,560
- Good morning, this is Park...
- Good morning, this is Jung...

183
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:34,134
- The river flows...
- Good morning, this is Park...

184
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,338
Eunji, you went drinking
last night, didn't you?

185
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,172
- No, I didn't.
- You look puffy.

186
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,672
- Do I look puffy?
- Now in the street...

187
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,644
Hello. This is Eunji Han.

188
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:51,618
Today, I am going to
introduce you to lacrosse.

189
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:56,054
It is one of the oldest sports
developed in North America...

190
00:29:56,694 --> 00:29:57,854
Okay, let's go.

191
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,783
Hey kid, you can't smoke here.

192
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:13,892
What's this scar?

193
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:17,191
From when I gave birth.

194
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:20,896
Did it hurt a lot?

195
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:29,039
I can't remember.
I was so young when I had him.

196
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,723
Stop! Stop!

197
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,425
- Do you want to see something?
- What?

198
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,032
Oh, something.
But you can't laugh.

199
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:53,134
- What is it?
- One second.

200
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,047
Tada!

201
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:19,795
- How do I look?
- What's that?

202
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,625
- So what do you think? Take a look.
- I don't want to.

203
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:34,274
I was worried that it wouldn't fit.
What a relief, it still does.

204
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,948
What the hell is that?

205
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,686
I... went out f or this pageant.

206
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,159
- Boy, you kept that all this time?
- Of course.

207
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:57,826
- Why did you go out for that?
- Why not? Can't I?

208
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,620
Now. Ask me.

209
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:21,990
- What?
- The questions they ask at things.

210
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:27,125
- I don't wanna.
- Come on, ask me.

211
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,033
- No.
- Ask me!

212
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,001
When did you go out f or this?

213
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,211
- Before I had the kid.
- So did you win?

214
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:52,019
The presenter asked me
what I would do if I lost.

215
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,115
- So?
- I said I'd kill myself.

216
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,821
He must have been shocked.

217
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,665
He also asked
what my future plans were.

218
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:06,565
- What did you say?
- You ask me.

219
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,904
What would you
like to do first if you win?

220
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:14,971
Get married.

221
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,277
Ask me more.

222
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:26,515
If you're crowned Miss Cotton...

223
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,331
who will you first tell this happy news?

224
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,599
Jun.

225
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,543
Ugh. Enough.

226
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,084
I'm sorry.

227
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,256
- Are you okay?
- Shut up, you bastard.

228
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,844
Um, Mister Jun.

229
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,276
'Ellen Kim: Retrospective'

230
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,999
I... God!

231
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,271
- You're Jun, right?
- Yes.

232
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,881
I'm Eunji's sister, Hyunji.

233
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:44,520
Something came up so she sent me first.
She was worried you'd have to wait.

234
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:48,415
- Have you been waiting long?
- Not long.

235
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,487
I don't look much like her, do I?

236
00:38:55,499 --> 00:39:00,163
Everyone says so. That we don't look
alike. I heard you're serving part-time.

237
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:10,246
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

238
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,749
I can be so rude sometimes.

239
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:22,518
That's okay.
It's because I'm not good with words.

240
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,988
I like that you're cheerful.

241
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:32,596
Really? That's good.

242
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:38,908
Let's finish this fast and catch a movie.
One with Bruce Lee.

243
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,038
Is something up with Eunji?

244
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:51,280
Well... she just seems busy.
You know how it is with broadcasting.

245
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:57,477
She looked very down.
Well, what do I know?

246
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,321
I don't know.

247
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,990
- Tell me about yourself.
- Me?

248
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,527
Yeah. This and that.

249
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,531
What you're doing now,
what you're gonna do...

250
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,868
Hobbies, what you like, stuff like that.

251
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,340
What I'm doing now is serving.

252
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:21,368
- Oh, sorry.
- And before, I was a college student.

253
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:26,809
- What do you like?
- What I like... is to sleep.

254
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:33,151
- Future goals?
- Future goals, I don't know yet.

255
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,515
What about you?

256
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,921
- I like to run.
- To run?

257
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,866
I'm a runner at my school.
I'm not that good but

258
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,598
my specialty is the 200 meter dash.

259
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:55,671
- Why? Is it strange?
- No. Just that runners aren't so common.

260
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,605
Is it strange?

261
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,407
Nah. It suits you, Hyunji.

262
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,245
I mean it.

263
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:17,690
- I have something to say. Will you listen?
- Yeah. What?

264
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:20,302
- Have you ever seen a deer?
- A deer?

265
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,202
- Yeah. And not at a zoo.
- No.

266
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,703
A few days ago, in my dreams,
a deer stared at me in the parking lot.

267
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:35,242
I f eel as if it's real...
it's not in my dreams.

268
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:42,490
This deer looked at me after eating
some grass in the parking lot.

269
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,292
Just looked at me...
I thought it would run away.

270
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,458
But it didn't.

271
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,362
For a long time, we looked
at each other like that.

272
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:00,637
- You don't believe me?
- You said it was a dream.

273
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,473
You know, a dream that f eels real.

274
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:11,586
These days, when I'm at the office, I look
at that spot all the time. Just in case.

275
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,541
Mister Jun...

276
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:47,723
- What are you doing right now?
- What do you think?

277
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:53,626
- How do I look?
- So-so.

278
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:02,468
Then take a look at this.
I tried it on before and it looked okay.

279
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,510
How come you have such little hair?

280
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:11,740
Wait a second.

281
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:20,585
Hello? Yes, it's me.

282
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:26,628
Oh, one second. Telephone.

283
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:29,926
- Huh?
- The phone.

284
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,730
Yes, hello?

285
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,570
Oh, hey, it's been ages. Yeah...

286
00:44:42,146 --> 00:44:44,478
His name is Jun, too.
He works here.

287
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,210
We have the same name.
That's why I keep him around.

288
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:50,349
Right, right.

289
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,854
The cleaners is doing fine, buddy.

290
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:00,693
Oh, not too many customers.
Just enough to get by.

291
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,161
It's nice.
The neighborhoods quiet.

292
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:13,866
I talk to them now and then.

293
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,646
It's okay.

294
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:26,612
Oh, you're a manager now?
Congrats,

295
00:45:27,524 --> 00:45:30,118
during these lean times.
What about the others?

296
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:34,020
Yeah, yeah.

297
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:39,795
What rumor?

298
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:48,274
Yeah, I saw the poster, too.

299
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:52,979
It was in the papers, too?

300
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:59,414
Go there, f or what?

301
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:16,039
Leave it be.
So much time's passed.

302
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:18,565
Yeah.

303
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:26,612
Hey, how is In-Gi doing?

304
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:30,745
Really?

305
00:46:32,823 --> 00:46:35,087
Those enemies are partners?

306
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:40,088
Oh, right. Tell them
to quit fighting and to get along.

307
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,324
So they can make some money now.

308
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,105
Jun, it's time to work.

309
00:48:38,815 --> 00:48:40,407
Jun, don't be late.

310
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,286
Why didn't you come?

311
00:48:57,834 --> 00:48:59,096
Why didn't you?

312
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,998
- I had an appointment.
- Then you should have called at least!

313
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:36,131
Hyunji!

314
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:38,901
Hyunji!

315
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,506
Ah, I can't run anymore.

316
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:52,886
- Hyunji Han!
- Hyunji.

317
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,452
Over there.

318
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:00,921
Jun!

319
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:07,727
- Do you practice like that every day?
- About 2 or 3 times a week.

320
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,629
The coach isn't here today
so we're just practicing on our own.

321
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:14,475
Isn't hard to run like that?

322
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:19,005
Huh? This is nothing.
Cause I'm a sprinter.

323
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:25,952
- I used to be good at running too.
- Oh, you lie.

324
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,721
- I used to be very quick.
- Really? Come on...

325
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:37,225
I may not look it but
I'm probably faster than you.

326
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,524
What?

327
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,802
You see the end over there?
To there.

328
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,143
- Will you be okay?
- Don't make me laugh.

329
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,178
- Go, Hyunji!
- Go, Hyunji!

330
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,579
Go, Man!

331
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:00,185
What?

332
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:06,252
One... Two... Three...

333
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:43,665
I almost lose to him.
Are you okay?

334
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:50,699
- No problem.
- Yes problem. I told you.

335
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:06,813
Hey, I can catch
the wind with my hand.

336
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:12,118
- Hyunji...
- Hey, do you know what?

337
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,399
I like this kind of wind.

338
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,571
Jun, we're almost there...

339
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:52,814
Hello?

340
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:57,290
- Hello?
- Oh, Jun.

341
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:02,195
- Huh...
- It's been awhile.

342
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,461
Just seeing if you're okay.

343
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:11,834
I'm fine.
It's strange, you calling.

344
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:18,243
- Why, I even went to the station.
- When?

345
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:21,511
It's been some time.

346
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:26,980
- I couldn't find where you worked.
- You did?

347
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,650
Right, I heard it from Hyunji.

348
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:34,255
Hey, Jun.
Do you have some time tomorrow?

349
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,829
- Tomorrow?
- Are you busy?

350
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:46,339
Just... I'm not sure.
There's a lot on my mind.

351
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,871
Is something wrong?

352
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,715
- Eunji...
- Jun, what?

353
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:04,026
I think I have time tomorrow.

354
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,087
That's great.

355
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:14,901
- It's great here.
- Yeah?

356
00:56:16,172 --> 00:56:19,630
I didn't realize
passing by here every day.

357
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:25,810
- You'd be discharged soon, right?
- Right. I only have a few days left.

358
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:30,619
Man, time just flies by.

359
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,385
Yeah, you're right.

360
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,119
It's just the beginning f or you.

361
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:44,462
Jun, I...

362
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:50,800
Hey, let's go somewhere else.

363
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:01,539
- What is this?
- I don't want to talk to you.

364
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,350
What are you doing right now?

365
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,023
What are you doing right now!

366
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,081
She looked older.

367
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:42,653
Does she like you?

368
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:54,795
- Or, do you like her?
- No, it's not like that.

369
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:04,645
A few times...

370
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:09,344
well, we slept together.

371
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,315
I am...

372
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:19,953
I can't figure it out.
I knew it was wrong...

373
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,326
I don't know why I did it.

374
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:30,632
You think it's wrong, don't you?

375
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,806
No.

376
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,977
- It must have been a mistake.
- Mistake?

377
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:44,317
Yeah. People make mistakes,
don't they?

378
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,153
Is there something wrong?

379
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,723
No, nothing.

380
00:58:55,665 --> 00:59:01,228
I wanted have a nice time
with you but it got kind of weird.

381
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:21,184
Jun. I... like you.

382
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:25,018
I was going to say that before.

383
00:59:57,126 --> 01:00:00,527
Are you not going to
call again, like the last time?

384
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:30,985
Does it look alright?

385
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:37,026
Yes. Looks cool.

386
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,803
My first painting in a long time.

387
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:50,070
- Did you draw that, over there?
- Yep.

388
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,644
It's a little different.
There are no trees, either.

389
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,185
A painting is up to the artist.

390
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,836
- Jun.
- Yes.

391
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,571
Is something bothering you?

392
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:31,515
No.

393
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,160
Why did you stop painting?

394
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:43,930
What can I say...

395
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:03,250
I wish I had something like that, too.

396
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:08,481
Something... I can really get into.

397
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:53,003
Do you like them?

398
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:58,176
- Yes, I do.
- I'm glad.

399
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,279
This isn't one of yours, I guess.

400
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,644
No, it isn't.

401
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:09,357
A friend gave it to me.
A long time ago.

402
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:20,366
Actually, I like this picture
better than my own paintings.

403
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,535
He must be a great painter.

404
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,602
Well, it's hard to say. We haven't
been in touch for a long time.

405
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,978
I just know that he
doesn't paint anymore.

406
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:38,009
- Is that him in that photo?
- Yes, it is.

407
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:43,052
This painting seems to put me at ease.

408
01:07:43,459 --> 01:07:44,517
Why is that?

409
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:50,655
Just that... the two seem very close.
For a long time.

410
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:57,169
Why did he stop painting?

411
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:00,400
I'm not quite sure.

412
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:07,744
Sometimes, for no reason,
I hate painting.

413
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:10,847
Maybe it was f or him, too.

414
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,051
May I ask a favor?

415
01:09:25,628 --> 01:09:29,064
Jun. Did something
happen with that woman?

416
01:09:29,698 --> 01:09:32,531
- Who?
- You know, that public worker.

417
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,328
I heard she handed in her resignation.

418
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:44,705
People are talking.
I'm not sure but...

419
01:09:46,148 --> 01:09:50,346
there's talk that she had a fight
with you. That's way she quit.

420
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:56,182
Jun, what if people find out
about your relationship with her?

421
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:01,420
It doesn't matter.
And there is nothing between us.

422
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:11,205
- Are you good at running?
- Huh?

423
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:16,543
- Running, are you good?
- Me? l, well, I'm alright.

424
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:20,814
- How about loser buys dinner?
- Sure.

425
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,114
- It's to over there.
- Okay.

426
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,455
- Shall I count?
- Whatever.

427
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:32,218
- Okay, one... Two...
- Wait.

428
01:10:32,595 --> 01:10:34,927
- Today's menu is chicken stew!
- Three!

429
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:51,765
Hyunji.

430
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,202
Hyunji.

431
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,774
Hyunji!

432
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,537
Hyunji!

433
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:39,973
Jun.

434
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:43,875
Hyunji.

435
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,822
I like you.

436
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:52,220
This time, f or real.

437
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,848
- Eunji...
- I have to go.

438
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,922
- Um, hello?
- Hello?

439
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,350
- Hello?
- This is the front desk.

440
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:34,049
If you're staying the night,
you have to pay more.

441
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:36,053
Okay, I got it.

442
01:17:59,908 --> 01:18:01,034
How do you like the painting?

443
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,106
Very good.

444
01:18:07,616 --> 01:18:10,084
And that doesn't
look like my painting.

445
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,778
Really?

446
01:18:16,558 --> 01:18:17,957
Thanks f or the invitation.

447
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:26,460
Your friend came.
He is your friend, right?

448
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:30,071
Oh, that fellow...

449
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:35,740
We owe him, both of us.

450
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:51,057
This is my last time treating you.

451
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:56,797
- Gotcha. I'll come by often.
- You promised.

452
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:06,867
It must be hard to work
in this cold weather.

453
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,067
What?
It's not hard in the summer?

454
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:30,357
- Are you Jun?
- Huh?

455
01:19:31,066 --> 01:19:34,524
Fucking son of a bitch...
I'm gonna smash your...

456
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:40,402
- You bastard...
- Let's talk this out!

457
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:43,472
This young motherfucker!

458
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,383
Young bastard like you
with plenty of girls around...

459
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,985
- Get off! Get off, bastard!
- Calm down, Mister!

460
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,020
Mister, let's talk!

461
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:05,294
Who's in charge of this bastard?
Get him out here!

462
01:20:33,595 --> 01:20:36,723
Take this.
And we need to take an x-ray

463
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:39,732
to see if the bone is in place.
Bring this to x-ray room four.

464
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,633
Is your arm alright?

465
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:18,004
They say it's broken.

466
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,404
What a drag!

467
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:28,648
How's the cheek?

468
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:40,725
He was your husband, right?

469
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:50,002
Why didn't you come?

470
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,166
I didn't want to see you.

471
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:02,876
Does it hurt much?

472
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:07,818
Why did you quit?

473
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:16,327
I guess this is the price of sin.

474
01:22:18,633 --> 01:22:19,998
- Sin?
- Uh-huh.

475
01:22:24,339 --> 01:22:26,807
- Isn't the price too high for the sin?
- No.

476
01:22:28,243 --> 01:22:29,403
Not at all.

477
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:34,243
This is nothing.

478
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:06,944
- Jun, Jun.
- Yes, I'm coming.

479
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:12,318
How can you get up so late?

480
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:17,583
- Mom, I don't work today.
- Are you crazy? Why not?

481
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:22,391
- Mom, I get discharged.
- Discharged?

482
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:26,760
Oh dear,
what happened to your arm?

483
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:29,197
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

484
01:23:29,304 --> 01:23:32,705
- Just a slight crack.
- What have you been doing?

485
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:35,943
It itches. Do you have
a long stick or something?

486
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:02,267
A week after getting discharged,

487
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,499
I am still sitting at the cleaners.

488
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,365
Mister Jun has left.

489
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:14,481
I thought he would go
with her but he went alone.

490
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,458
Mister Jun said that he'd leave
the cleaners to me f or the time being.

491
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:28,823
I had no way of knowing
when he'd be back.

492
01:24:30,598 --> 01:24:32,361
I'm thinking of a new plan.

493
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:35,401
I don't want to go back to college yet.

494
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:38,603
I don't know what I need to study
so I'm delaying going back.

495
01:24:40,442 --> 01:24:43,036
I'm thinking of making
this cleaners into a real a cool place.

496
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:52,720
I feel much calmer these days.
I hadn't before...

497
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:15,131
Eunji.

498
01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:23,378
Are you opening something new?

499
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:27,978
No. I just want to change it a little.

500
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:32,220
Yeah?
It doesn't look like a little.

501
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,222
What's with the arm?

502
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:43,530
Oh, this... I f ell down.

503
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:51,039
I'm going to study abroad.

504
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:56,709
- When?
- My flight's tomorrow night.

505
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:05,317
I see.

506
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:11,691
What are you going to do now?
Aren't you going back to school?

507
01:26:15,036 --> 01:26:18,870
I will, later.
I don't f eel like it yet.

508
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:28,979
Do you want something to drink?

509
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:34,819
- You don't look like you have anything.
- No, I have some water over there.

510
01:26:36,958 --> 01:26:41,657
No thanks. That's okay.
I just came to say goodbye.

511
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:05,709
' Jun's Cleaners'

512
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:15,454
It's okay. Smoke.

513
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:18,758
A light...

514
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:54,853
- It's hard, huh?
- Yes.

515
01:28:58,232 --> 01:29:00,757
- You want to hear a story?
- Yes.

516
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:05,368
When I first got here,
my senior officer told me this story.

517
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:09,109
I don't know if it's true

518
01:29:09,744 --> 01:29:13,874
cause he heard it from his senior
when he first got here.

519
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:20,987
So that senior officer... No, wait,
his senior, senior, senior officer

520
01:29:21,322 --> 01:29:23,722
was about to get discharged.

521
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:28,558
That guy was on dawn duty.
Or was it night?

522
01:29:29,497 --> 01:29:33,524
Anyway, he suddenly heard something.

523
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:35,902
It sounded like footsteps. Or crumbling.

524
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:42,071
So he went over to the place
and there was a deer standing there.

525
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:47,604
A deer was staring at him
in the middle of the parking lot.

526
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:50,349
A real deer.
Like the ones you see in a zoo.

527
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:54,387
- It must be a lie.
- It's the truth!

528
01:29:55,156 --> 01:29:58,023
- I can't believe it.
- No, he really saw it.

529
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:22,405
A year later,
Jun's Cleaners closed its doors.

530
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:24,917
Mister Jun started painting again.

531
01:30:24,986 --> 01:30:28,422
Hyunji quit running.
Eunji is still studying abroad.

532
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:30,923
No one knows about the others.

533
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:33,426
Jun still dreams about the deer.
