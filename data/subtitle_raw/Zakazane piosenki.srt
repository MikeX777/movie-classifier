00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,920
FORBIDDEN SONGS

2
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,480
A SONG IS THE MAIN CHARACTER
OF THIS FILM.

3
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,120
NAÏVE, SIMPLE, REAL SONG.

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,400
DURING THE HARDEST DAYS OF OCCUPATION,
IT WAS ABLE TO MOCK THE ENEMY,

5
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,959
UPLIFT THE SPIRIT,
AND BRING SOME OPTIMISM.

6
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,840
AND THAT IS WHY IT DESERVED A FILM.

7
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:28,719
<i>This song, the only song
I sing it for you, my girl</i>

8
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:38,080
<i>Maybe your heart full of love
Is at loss too</i>

9
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:46,840
<i>Maybe you keep your love in secret?
And you sob through the night?</i>

10
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:57,240
<i>The song, the only song
I sing it for you, my girl.</i>

11
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,560
Why are you so glum?

12
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,599
Memories, my brother.

13
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,120
That is what brought us here.
It's time for celebration.

14
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,960
It's all over.
The occupation, the Uprising.

15
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,639
Pour me some, Jurek.

16
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,639
This song doesn't work on you, huh?

17
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,599
I like it.
Guys used to sing it in Scotland.

18
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,680
In Scotland? Very funny!

19
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:29,840
There, you could have sung
whatever you wanted!

20
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,240
You should have tried it
with  the Germans.

21
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,560
From what you're saying,
it wasn't that bad.

22
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,639
- Have you gone crazy?
- What is she saying?

23
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,680
- He;s mad!
- But you said that...

24
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,520
- You're a dolt!
- Wait, guys.

25
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,479
He got confused.

26
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,159
So you say it wasn't that bad
during German times?

27
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,719
If you were allowed to sing
such songs in public...

28
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,759
- in front of the Germans...
- Even the worse songs.

29
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,080
- You see?
- Jurek. Where are you from?

30
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,280
- Is that a new joke?
- It's not a joke. Answer me.

31
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,919
Where did you grow up?

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,800
Don't make a fool of me.
In Skawina.

33
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:06,479
You should have spent
more time in Warsaw.

34
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,280
And less in England.

35
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,159
You don't know Warsaw.

36
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,120
- Sorry, guys, but...
- Calm down. Stop arguing.

37
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,639
I'm not arguing.

38
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,399
You see, the situation was terrible.

39
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,360
You know that, even though
you were far away from here.

40
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,360
There were round-ups, street executions,
Majdanek, Auschwitz, Pawiak.

41
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,439
Each family suffered during
that time.

42
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:33,879
There was also our fight.
AL, AK, Peasants' Battalions.

43
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,920
And we had yet another weapon
we used in the streets of Warsaw.

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,879
You all remember it.
It was a laugh and song.

45
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,879
And it was a pretty good weapon
that kept our spirit up.

46
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,839
Oh yes!
Germans were scared to death.

47
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,759
- They did they best to cut it out.
- And they failed.

48
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,720
In Warsaw, nobody cared about
their prohibitions.

49
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
A lot of singers ended up
in Auschwitz.

50
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,279
- Many of them lost their lives.
- What's this lecture for?

51
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,000
Sit down and tell Jurek that
story you told us so many times.

52
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,959
How Warsaw fought against Germans
with a song.

53
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,639
- He is one of the heroes.
- Oh, come on!

54
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,959
A natural modesty.

55
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,759
- Play it!
- Sit down and play!

56
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,839
All right.

57
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,560
But don't you ever say that
we were doing nothing

58
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,120
but singing forbidden songs.

59
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,040
Come on, I never said that.

60
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,319
- You wouldn't dare!
- Sit down.

61
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,879
Good.

62
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,879
Let me warn you once again
that this is not

63
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,439
a national epic.

64
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:36,399
It's just a story of a forbidden song
and our memories attached to it.

65
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,800
Some of these memories come together.
The others create...

66
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,240
- Stop talking, start playing.
- Play.

67
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:44,639
Wait...

68
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,279
One second...

69
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,160
Where do I start...

70
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,399
No, no, no.
The beginning was different.

71
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,360
This is how it started.

72
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:10,120
October 1939. Germans have just
entered Warsaw.

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,360
The war is lost. Hopelessness.
Warsaw in ruins.

74
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,720
It's nothing compared to
the Uprising, but then we thought

75
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,519
it couldn't be any worse.

76
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:24,959
And the first forbidden melody came up.

77
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,199
The first revolt at the ruins
of the Warsaw National Philharmonic.

78
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,519
In the beginning, there were
few musicians. And then...

79
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,480
Is your brother home, miss Halinka?

80
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,800
- Yes. What happened?
- A very important thing.

81
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,120
Romek, someone to see you.

82
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,759
Hi, my friend. Sit down.

83
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,600
I don't have much time, Mr. Tokarski.
Grab your instrument!

84
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,399
- Where to?
- That's a laugh! Come on!

85
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,040
He lives a few steps from the Philharmonic,
and he can't hear it.

86
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,600
No wonder, since you are knocking
all the time.

87
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,040
Come on, sir.

88
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,480
And?

89
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,160
Can you hear it now?

90
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,199
The Varsovian!

91
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,519
- Where?
- Who is playing?

92
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,920
Who is playing and where?

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,360
We are playing! Varsovians!
We are not afraid of the Germans.

94
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,800
This is just the beginning. England
and France have just joined the war.

95
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,079
Hurry up! Take your instrument.

96
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,240
I'm coming. Mom, where's my jacket?
Halinka, give me my violin.

97
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,639
All right. I must move on.

98
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,639
Wait! I'm ready.

99
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,040
I have no time. I must tell the others,
including your neighbour.

100
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,480
Mr. Cieślak? No chance.
He is scared to death.

101
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,080
Come with us. Hurry up.

102
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,519
- To the shelter? Is it an air raid?
- What raid?

103
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,320
- So what happened?
- Oh, come on!

104
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,720
A rebellion! For destroying Warsaw,
for the philharmonic!

105
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,440
We're playing the Varsovian.

106
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,559
I'm ready. Let's go!

107
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,399
You will find out when you get there.

108
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,840
We will be waiting, Mr. Cieślak.

109
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,559
Mr. Neighbor, you have to!

110
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,159
Romek, your hat!

111
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,759
Aren't you going?

112
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,559
- Where to?
- Don't you know?

113
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,240
Oh, against the Germans.

114
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,480
With a bayonet and rifle.

115
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,720
And with my violin?

116
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,559
You are so timid.

117
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,799
I'm just careful.

118
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,159
- Come on, mom.
- Bring me my coat.

119
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,519
Oh! They're still playing.

120
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,159
God. Why put yourself at risk?

121
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,679
Wouldn't it be better to wait until Easter,
until the war is over?

122
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,120
This would be a good moment
to play the Varsovian or the Marseillaise.

123
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,600
Easter? What a pessimist!

124
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,200
Who would survive six months of the war?
It will be over for Christmas.

125
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,320
VALERIAN

126
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,519
It was not a forbidden melody.

127
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,200
Come one, Romek.
I can't listen to it.

128
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,279
You remember how they tortured us
with it?

129
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,639
The army, the party, even their children,
the Hitler Youth.

130
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,759
They loved to sing it on every occasion.

131
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,720
It was a special occasion.
They wanted to break us down.

132
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,759
They did it on purpose.

133
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,440
But we did not give up.
We returned with our song.

134
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:11,919
You remember?

135
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,039
<i>Let's drink wine, chevau-légers...</i>

136
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,759
They used to sing it before the war.
And during the occupation...

137
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:31,320
<i>It was September, just after midnight
The power of the battle squadrons</i>

138
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:40,519
<i>Appeared with the hum of the engines
And turned the silent night into hell</i>

139
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:50,039
<i>They bombed towns and stations
While everybody was asleep</i>

140
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:58,320
<i>When we expected nothing
They struck a brutal blow</i>

141
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:08,159
<i>The defenders formed a wall
Their bayonets shone in the morning sun</i>

142
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:16,840
<i>When the fight felt went, they shouted
And pushed the enemy back</i>

143
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:25,799
<i>And then the aircraft appeared
To support its ranks</i>

144
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:35,320
<i>Our eagles were not there
So we have to move back</i>

145
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:44,360
<i>We were retreating from the city gates
Chased by the queue of tanks</i>

146
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:53,519
<i>There is no need to cry for the country
As this misery will not last long</i>

147
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,159
<i>There is no need to cry for the country
As this misery will not last long</i>

148
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,600
Amen, our poor soldiers.

149
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:16,960
This misery will not last long.

150
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,200
The Krauts will fall soon, right?

151
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,799
Sooner than you think.

152
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:25,159
I keep saying that.
Forget about what these rags write.

153
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,639
They won't trick us.
We have better news.

154
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:36,279
"When the black eagle falls broken,
when he turns his eyes to the east,

155
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,080
Poland will reclaim
the Masurian land

156
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,120
and Gdansk will return.

157
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,480
In a vicious fight against
the Teutonic arrogance."

158
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,840
Enough.

159
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,200
- Stop it, please.
- What happened?

160
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,039
It's a samizdat. Burn it right away.

161
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,000
Their ears are everywhere.

162
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,480
You expect nothing, and then...

163
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,600
Ah, hello, neighbour!

164
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,960
Good morning.

165
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,000
I've been reading our new
prophecies to Mr. Cieślak.

166
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,399
Nice, isn't it?

167
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,399
- You are so timid!
- Careful. Just careful.

168
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,080
Guess what I brought, mother.

169
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:20,200
- What?
- Come on.

170
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,240
- Is it fixed? Really?
- It is indeed.

171
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,240
I am so happy.
Halinka will be delighted!

172
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:46,360
You see, this is our family heirloom.

173
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,360
Our mascot.

174
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,840
It was constructed by my grandfather
who was a watchmaker.

175
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,080
Just look at it.
What a beautiful piece.

176
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,360
Right. It's nice.

177
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,679
- Does it chime?
- Of course. You will hear it.

178
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,919
What?

179
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,360
The Varsovian again?

180
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,559
Isn't it a wonderful sound?

181
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,759
For God's sake! Stop it!
You will bring misfortune.

182
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,840
It is a forbidden melody.
It's like having radio in your house.

183
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,639
Aren't you exaggerating a bit?

184
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,279
Our neighbour is just very careful.

185
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,080
This is how you should live these days.
It's the only option, ma'am.

186
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,840
These are very dangerous things.

187
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:53,399
Dangerous? Can't you hear what
they are singing?

188
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,279
They are not afraid at all.
Just listen.

189
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:06,640
<i>On September 1st
That memorable year</i>

190
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,319
<i>The hostile neighbour attacked Poland</i>

191
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,119
<i>They showed no mercy to our Warsaw</i>

192
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,480
<i>Our beloved Warsaw
They flooded you with blood</i>

193
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:32,559
<i>You used to be beautiful and rich
And now all I see is you dust</i>

194
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:42,839
<i>Churches destroyed, houses burnt down
Where your people can find shelter?</i>

195
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:53,480
<i>The bombs are dropping all day long
There is no water to extinguish the fire</i>

196
00:17:54,119 --> 00:18:05,000
<i>A mother keeps seeking her child's body
She is calling God and cursing the enemy</i>

197
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:10,799
<i>They were torturing us like this
for more than three weeks!</i>

198
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,039
<i>God will punish the Krauts
For their awful crimes!</i>

199
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:22,000
<i>What I am singing now
Is just unbelievable</i>

200
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,319
<i>There will be the end of my tale</i>

201
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:39,720
<i>God's grace is with us
We will rebuild Poland</i>

202
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,039
What are you writing?

203
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,599
Howdy, Halinka.
Sit down, please.

204
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,400
- I'm noting this song for Romek.
- This one?

205
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:52,319
He already has it.

206
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:58,599
- I thought you were writing a love letter.
- Only to you.

207
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,160
Black coffee, please.

208
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:09,160
How are you doing?

209
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,160
Bad news.
Only German successes.

210
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,400
All lies.
Don't believe these rags.

211
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,079
Alack.
The radio says the same.

212
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,039
It's impossible.

213
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:32,319
Do you know what they say in the city?
Food riots in Berlin.

214
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,480
The whole army from the Government
went there.

215
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,480
There is not a single soldier in Warsaw.
Only the officials.

216
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,960
Today, I myself saw...

217
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,839
Don't worry, Halinka.
Damn them all.

218
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:32,720
Cheer up.
Smile.

219
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,559
There will be a day when...

220
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:46,920
Beer, please.

221
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,920
Don't beat yourself.
It's a waste of teeth.

222
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,279
You see! Excuse me a moment.

223
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,640
- Howdy, Jurek.
- Hi.

224
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,839
- What's up?
- Nothing important.

225
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,200
- Today at 6, as always.
- Where?

226
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:06,880
- Same place as yesterday.
- Done.

227
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,640
- What are you writing?
- Nothing. Just like that.

228
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,119
- I thought you were writing a love letter.
- Only to you.

229
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,000
You're so lovely.

230
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,559
Remember it.

231
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,839
- By the way, this evening...
- Just as I thought.

232
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,920
- You are busy again.
- Are you mad at me?

233
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,920
- Rysiek.
- It's all right.

234
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,599
We can meet tonight at 8:30 PM.
Same place as yesterday.

235
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,240
<i>Fräulein...</i>

236
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:55,440
You think it's funny?
I was so afraid for you.

237
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,880
I had a feeling
something bad had happened to you.

238
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,279
Why? It's nonsense.

239
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,920
Can you hear it?

240
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,079
This melody brings misfortune.

241
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,240
People say wherever this busker
appears,

242
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:17,640
something bad happens.

243
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,759
Cursed melody?

244
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,160
An adult lady believes in such nonsense.
It's just a poor student.

245
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,559
<i>Axe, hoe, January, booze
German and Italian lose their shoes</i>

246
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,519
<i>Axe, hoe, rope line, wire to be put
Mr. Painter is kaputt</i>

247
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,240
<i>Axe, hoe, hand saw, bay
Air raid by night, roundup by day</i>

248
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:07,119
<i>Axe, hoe glass, ban
Run away while you can!</i>

249
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:11,480
<i>Axe, hoe, gendarme, blast
Everyone is running fast</i>

250
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:15,680
<i>There's no need to stay in the Citadel
Or in another awful cell</i>

251
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,319
<i>Axe, hoe, hand saw, meat
This is Skaryszewska Street</i>

252
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,599
<i>Axe, hoe, hand saw, two planks, sow
We are in Skaryszewska now</i>

253
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,200
<i>How dream? How to believe?
Dogcatchers don't let us live</i>

254
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:43,920
<i>As in their culture it is allowed
to do this hunting in the crowd</i>

255
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,920
<i>Axe, hoe, hand saw, bay
Air raid by night, roundup by day</i>

256
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,759
<i>Axe, hoe, hand saw, blow
Take this note and let me go</i>

257
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,400
<i>If you don't have any money
You will be deported to Germany</i>

258
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,559
<i>Axe, hoe, hand saw, thinker
Here's the Prussia, there's Treblinka</i>

259
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:19,039
<i>We have no more place to hide
Dogcatchers lost their pride</i>

260
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:28,079
<i>They are running through the street
Looking for another meat</i>

261
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,759
<i>As in their culture it is allowed
To do this hunting in the crowd</i>

262
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,839
<i>There must be something wrong with them
Since they are coming after us</i>

263
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,240
<i>Axe, hoe, hand saw, stainer
The war is lost for the stupid painter</i>

264
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,440
<i>Axe, hoe, hand saw, my frau
He is losing now, now, now.</i>

265
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,319
<i>Axe, hoe, hand saw, gas, tier
When will they get out of here</i>

266
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,160
<i>Axe, hoe, electricity and gas
We will kick your ass!</i>

267
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:43,000
But not only the lyrics
drove the Germans mad.

268
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,480
Even the music aggravated them
if it was Polish.

269
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,319
Mazur, polonaise, kujawiak.
It was all forbidden.

270
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,279
Forbidden melodies.

271
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,559
Those who came to forbidden concerts

272
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,000
took a huge risk.

273
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:19,960
But that didn't stop them.
They were in Poland,

274
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:25,119
even just for an hour.
It was the miracle of Chopin.

275
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,359
So it was worth the risk.

276
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,400
Such concerts lifted people's spirits.

277
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:36,440
Drag them away from the activates
with the help of which

278
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:38,960
Germans wanted to corrupt Polish slaves.

279
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:46,440
German propaganda replaced music
with some cheap tunes.

280
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,599
Childish entertainment instead of theatres.

281
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,839
Gambling in casinos.

282
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,599
They wanted to enslave the souls.

283
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,319
Why are you so happy today,
Mr. Antoni?

284
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,759
Great news.

285
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,240
I'm not interested in politics.

286
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,920
I don't want to hear anything!

287
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:34,119
From a certain person.

288
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,079
The war ends on September 15
at 3 PM.

289
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,160
- It's official!
- I can't hear you!

290
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,960
Seven Englishmen have already landed.
The end is near.

291
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,519
Warsaw Courier, the latest news!

292
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,519
- The latest news!
- Kid!

293
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:06,400
- What news?
- Hitler lost his shoes!

294
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:17,119
Long time, no see.

295
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,640
Welcome, my beloved friend.
Any news?

296
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,119
Nothing.

297
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,880
- Are you going to work?
- I guess so.

298
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:25,599
Did you hear?

299
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,319
After that, supposedly...
Radio says

300
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,799
that Hitler has gone mad
and it is for sure...

301
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,039
Quiet, for God's sake!
They hear everything.

302
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,039
It's too risky to even whisper
about it.

303
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,240
Mr. Antoni?

304
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:18,279
The latest newsletter.
Read it and pass it on.

305
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,039
Who is she?

306
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,119
The former Maria Kędziorek.
But now...

307
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,359
MARIE KENDSCHOREK

308
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,119
What a stunt.

309
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,960
Mr Roman?

310
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:20,160
- A cigarette.
- Here you are.

311
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,920
Thank you.

312
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,240
I'm sorry I dared to bother you.

313
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,279
I haven't smoked for days.

314
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,640
- I'm sure you understand.
- Of course.

315
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,319
- Would you like to take some for later?
- Thank you.

316
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,480
Come on.

317
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,319
I'm happy when I can talk
to someone.

318
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,039
So many months in hiding.

319
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:52,759
And that thought... that I can end up
in the ghetto at any moment.

320
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,880
It's terrible.

321
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,680
All I want is...

322
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:01,279
Excuse me.

323
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,880
FOR GERMANS ONLY

324
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,279
<i>The enemy attacked Poland
He mucked the land</i>

325
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:00,279
<i>It is because,
Jesus is still asleep</i>

326
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,160
<i>God will wake up
And shout with his power:</i>

327
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,960
<i>Drop dead bloody Hitler!</i>

328
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:23,039
<i>For burnt cities, for burnt huts
We will kick your ass!</i>

329
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,679
<i>I am eating bread
You ate some cookies</i>

330
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,519
<i>You say you bought it
I'm sure it was stolen!</i>

331
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,719
<i>Although there are some Huns
I'm not scared to sing</i>

332
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,960
<i>Cause that bloody bastards
Don't understand a word...</i>

333
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:59,119
<i>Halt! Halt!</i>

334
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,920
GERMAN VICTORIES ON ALL FRONTS

335
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,599
Stop, stop, stop!

336
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,559
- What are you playing?
- What's wrong?

337
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,800
It's c, a not cis.

338
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,239
What c? Can't you see a sign!

339
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,639
What sign?

340
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,840
It's a fly.

341
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,239
So let's start again.

342
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,599
Three, four!

343
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:11,679
<i>Raging Vistula is flowing at Cracow</i>

344
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:18,599
<i>Dirty scumbags got comfy
On our Polish land...</i>

345
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,920
For heaven's sake! What are you doing?
It's a forbidden song.

346
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,519
You can't even listen to it!

347
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:44,360
<i>We will kill a pig
We will make some sausage</i>

348
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,199
<i>With these sausages</i>

349
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:57,119
<i>We will poison all
The German cockroaches and rats</i>

350
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,039
I do not want to listen to this!

351
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,599
Damn it!

352
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,840
Where will I find new strings?

353
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,360
You want me to go with you?

354
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,719
You better stay.

355
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,559
It's safer when a woman goes alone.

356
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,360
But I don't know if
someone is in the house.

357
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:59,199
Here they are.

358
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,440
Good morning.

359
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:07,119
Good morning, sir.

360
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,559
What are you so confused?

361
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,440
Anything bad?

362
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:22,159
Are you going to the shelter?

363
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:25,760
Was there an alarm?

364
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,079
No. We're going to the countryside
to get some provisions.

365
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,440
What provision?

366
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,559
You are so timid.

367
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,760
I resent that.
I'm just careful.

368
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:48,440
- Here.
- Thank you very much.

369
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,760
You want to see my brother?

370
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,760
My string[s broken.
I would like to borrow one.

371
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,480
Romek has left.
I don't know where...

372
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:01,079
Oh, I see the case. Roman always
put his spare strings there.

373
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,920
Excuse me.

374
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,920
What happened, Mr. Cieślak?

375
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:00,000
It was the most dangerous
moment of my life.

376
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:46,559
Great job, miss.
Boys will be so happy.

377
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:48,679
I wish I could see them.

378
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,559
My train leaves in five minutes.
Anything for me?

379
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,679
Right. There's something for you.

380
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:01,000
Someone has to fix it in Warsaw.

381
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:03,679
- Burnt?
- I don't know.

382
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:07,639
- This should be replaced.
- All right.

383
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,400
- They asked us to hurry up.
- No problem.

384
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,880
<i>It's dark outside
The train is crowded</i>

385
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,840
<i>And the idyll begins</i>

386
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,039
<i>He hugs her
She's fat as a cow</i>

387
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:47,519
<i>Chopped meat under her coat</i>

388
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,639
<i>Something is dripping from her heart
It's lard and pork,</i>

389
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:53,119
<i>Plus two hams</i>

390
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:56,760
<i>When he's admiring her body
Some loin falls out</i>

391
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,480
<i>With the unsalted beacon</i>

392
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,920
<i>Now there's a war
Who trades, survives</i>

393
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,400
<i>When I sell my chop
Lard, and blood pudding</i>

394
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,360
<i>I will get myself some hooch</i>

395
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,519
<i>Now there's a war
Who trades, survives</i>

396
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,639
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

397
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,880
<i>I will get myself some hooch</i>

398
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:40,159
Before he finds out
What she has to sell

399
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:42,960
<i>The train stops at the station</i>

400
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,880
<i>The gendarmes get on
They take everything</i>

401
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,119
<i>you give them</i>

402
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,719
<i>The one is searching the pockets
The other is looking on the ground</i>

403
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:55,519
<i>And that one is checking the packages</i>

404
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:59,039
<i>They took lard, chop
And black pudding</i>

405
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:01,719
<i>Damn them all!</i>

406
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:05,400
<i>Now there's a war</i>

407
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,079
<i>Who trades, survives</i>

408
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:11,480
<i>When I sell my chop
Lard, and blood pudding</i>

409
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:14,320
<i>I will get myself some hooch</i>

410
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:20,480
<i>Now there's a war
It's hard to live on trading</i>

411
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,800
<i>They took lard, chop
And black pudding</i>

412
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,559
<i>There'll be no hooch</i>

413
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,599
Put something in the basket.
I'll but the Kraut a casket.

414
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,320
<i>Now there's a war
Who trades, survives</i>

415
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,679

Lard, and blood pudding</i>

416
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,360

<i>Now there's a war

418
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,800
<i>They took lard, chop

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,039
<i>There'll be no hooch</i>

420
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,880
Violin, right?

421
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:32,360
<i>Aber schwere. Violin.
Heavy.</i>

422
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,519
<i>Speck? Lard.
Guten Appetit. Bon appetit!</i>

423
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:38,360
"Today is my gloomy anniversary.

424
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,840
Two years of hiding.

425
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,320
I haven't been in the streets
for two years.

426
00:46:55,159 --> 00:47:01,440
For two years I haven't got close
to the window.

427
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,920
Good people saved me.

428
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,599
And if it hadn't been for them,
I would have starved to death."

429
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:25,559
<i>My Warsaw...</i>

430
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:31,360
<i>My Warsaw...</i>

431
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:44,760
<i>I cry anytime I see you
Warsaw, my Warsaw!</i>

432
00:47:46,519 --> 00:48:03,559
<i>In the ghetto, there is
Hunger, poverty, and cold</i>

433
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:10,000
<i>But the homesick is even worse, My Warsaw!</i>

434
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:23,679
<i>I'm sneaking across the wall
And I'm running like a chased dog!</i>

435
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:34,920
<i>Although, the authorities, the gendarmes
The Gestapo, and the SS are after me</i>

<i>My Warsaw!
There is a tear in my eye</i>

437
00:48:47,800 --> 00:49:00,519
<i>I don't know if I will
See you tomorrow, my Warsaw!</i>

438
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:14,800
<i>I'm sneaking across the wall
And I'm running like a chased dog!</i>

439
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:26,559
<i>Although, the authorities, the gendarmes
The Gestapo, and the SS are after me</i>

440

<i>The red apple

<i>Why are you frowning
On me, gendarme?</i>

447
00:51:27,639 --> 00:51:33,159
<i>Geese and duck behind the pond
They'll catch you girl cause you're young</i>

00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:39,039
<i>You will give him a note
He will give you up</i>

449
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:50,320
<i>Look, a lady is walking with a Kraut</i>

450
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:55,760
<i>She's so proud
From the ghetto, her dress comes.</i>

451
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:02,079
<i>Father, aren't you ashamed
Of your beloved daughter?</i>

452
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:07,840
<i>Of course, he's not
He as well became a Volksdeuthe</i>

453
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,480
<i>Geese and duck behind the pond
You'll be a good nark cause you're young</i>

454
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:19,199
<i>You will give everyone up
You're useful to me, I'm useful to you</i>

455
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:30,320
<i>The boys from the conspiracy
Caught her at the gate</i>

456
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,280
<i>They shaved her to the skin
They didn't spare the perm</i>

457
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:41,920
<i>When that didn't work
They brought her some flowers</i>

458
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:47,719
<i>Roses in one hand
Machine guns in the other</i>

459
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:54,119
<i>Geese and duck behind the pond
He killed you girl though you were young</i>

460
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:59,519
<i>She won't give anyone up
There is no use of a dead nark...</i>

461
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:24,519
<i>...if this happens again,</i>

462
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:26,400
<i>hostages will be executed.</i>

463
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,559
<i>And now the follow-up of the massage

464
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:33,320
<i>der Wehrmacht.</i>

465
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,719
<i>A fierce fight is taking place</i>

466

<i>in the southern section

467
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,800
<i>Our brave troops</i>

<i>As a part of planned movements,</i>

<i>The 1st SS Panzer Division

474

475
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:28,119
It's ready.

476
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,639
<i>There is no hope for the enemies
of the new Europe.</i>

477
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,239
<i>German victory is inevitable.
Because the Führer...</i>

478
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,639
Compatriots.
It's Polish Underground State.

479
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:25,679
Don't give up your hope.
Our freedom is imminent.

480
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:30,760
And now,
military and political news.

481
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,360
Yesterday, the Soviet troops
moved 26 km to the west

482
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,519
in an unstoppable attack.

483
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,519
246 towns were liberated.

484
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:45,119
The 1st Tadeusz Kosciuszko
Infantry Division

485
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:46,920
is engaged in the operation.

486
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,480
Yes?

487
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,599
What?

488
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,360
Unbelievable!

489
00:57:56,679 --> 00:57:58,480
Yes, sir!

490
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,320
Damn it! Not again!

491
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:30,280
Halt, halt!

492
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,880
Is this her son?

493
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,280
This is your son... in the photo?

494
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:09,079
Yes. It's my son.

495
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,599
Where is he now?

496
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:18,960
I told you.
He didn't say where he was going.

497
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,119
Silence, finally.

498
01:02:38,199 --> 01:02:39,960
Let sleeping dogs lie.

499
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:44,239
It was close. They were running
around the town like mad dogs.

500
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,639
Don't stop here.

501
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:52,639
It's always safer at home.

502
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:59,719
And your sonny is not here.
The curfew is coming.

503
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,559
Only Polish songs.
Can you play it?

504
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,280
I asked you a question.

505
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,159
Yes. These are my notes.
I can play it.

506
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,079
So play it, please.

507
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:21,880
Play!

508
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,280
I'm getting bored. Play something!

509
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:27,320
I don't know what.

510
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,480
Maybe something forbidden!

511
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,719
Deutschland, Deutschland
über alles! Go ahead!

512
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,920
- I can't.
- Now!

513
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:42,039
What are you doing?!

514
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:46,199
Play "Deutschland,
Deutschland über alles"!

515
01:03:50,599 --> 01:03:52,440
Polish pig!

516
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,679
Hans! Sit down!

517
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:59,119
Play something usual.

518
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:20,360
Can you hear it?

519
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:24,199
This is our piano.

520
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
German melody?
What's this?

521
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,679
Nothing serious.
Some old woman.

522
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,119
What now?

523
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:22,920
We can't go home.

524
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,480
Of course.

525
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:28,599
Never. We have to disappear.

526
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:32,440
- That was predictable.
- We disappear together, of course.

527
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:34,199
- Absolutely not.
- Romek!

528
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,840
Neither you nor our mother is in trouble.

529
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,760
Fortunately, there is nothing
compromising at home.

530
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:44,079
Anyway, they need you here.
You know that.

531
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:48,840
Who the hell?

532
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:51,679
Wait a second.

533
01:05:57,079 --> 01:06:00,360
- Rysio.
- Yes, my love?

534
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,599
So we have to split up.

535
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,760
It was bound to happen.

536
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,599
You think about the resistance?

537
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:16,000
I'm afraid for you. Don't laugh.

538
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:22,159
Maybe it's because our experiences
grew us together.

539
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,760
Our fight together.

540
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:28,679
It is, and it will always be
our common fight.

541
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:33,480
Although you are staying in Warsaw,
and we are going to the forest.

542
01:06:34,039 --> 01:06:39,159
Maybe this separation
will bring us even closer.

543
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,920
Rysio.

544
01:06:56,719 --> 01:06:58,440
And?

545
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:00,440
- Do you know who it was?
- Well?

546
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:01,960
Jurek.

547
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:04,360
They know who ratted us out.

548
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,199
So it was a denunciation?

549
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,119
Do you remember that busker
in a student hat?

550
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:10,239
Him?

551
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:14,599
You see? I told you that
this melody brings misfortune.

552
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:13,640
<i>The girl started to cry aloud
Her eyes shined with tears</i>

553
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:18,720
<i>For the soldier's plight</i>

554
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:29,000
<i>Her eyes shined with tears
For the soldier's plight</i>

555
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:39,479
<i>Be quiet, our willows
Do not let heart-breaking grief</i>

556
01:09:40,199 --> 01:09:49,560
<i>Make you cry, my girl
It is not that bad to be a partisan</i>

557
01:09:50,279 --> 01:10:00,039
<i>We are dancing to
The music played by Stens</i>

558
01:10:00,119 --> 01:10:10,199
<i>There are bodies everywhere
But we are not scared</i>

559
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:20,239
<i>Be quiet, our willows
Do not let heart-breaking grief</i>

560
01:10:21,079 --> 01:10:29,720
<i>Make you cry, my girl
It is not that bad to be a partisan</i>

561
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:38,399
<i>We are dancing to
The music played by Stens</i>

562
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:49,119
<i>There are bodies everywhere
But we are not scared</i>

563
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:54,479
<i>Whether it's rain or scorching heat</i>

564
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,119
<i>- you can hear our measured footsteps...
- What's on your mind?</i>

565
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,640
I'm thinking about what awaits us.

566
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,760
- Are you scared?
- No.

567
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,159
I would be sorry for Halinka if...

568
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:11,640
Why are you so girly today?

569
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:14,439
You're right, Romek.

570
01:11:16,119 --> 01:11:19,560
Just keep playing.

571
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,880
I like it.

572
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:26,920
Fall in!

573
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,399
I'll play it later.

574
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:38,399
Ten of you will take care of the bridge.
The others will support them.

575
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:41,840
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

576
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:44,039
Dismissed.

577
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:50,560
Damn it.
They should be here by now.

578
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:53,000
I don't know why they're complaining.

579
01:13:53,079 --> 01:13:55,319
Maybe they are taking the whole
train on their backs.

580
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,439
- Krauts.
- You think so?

581
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:07,880
Follow me!

582
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:30,880
31 JULY 1944

583
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,479
1 August 1944

584
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:14,239
Where have you been?

585
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:16,319
Everything's fine, mum.

586
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:18,760
I've been waiting for so long.

587
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,600
- Dinner is in the oven.
- Thank you.

588
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:25,199
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing.

589
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,960
You seem so strange today.
Why are you dressed like that?

590
01:19:30,039 --> 01:19:32,239
- Hala, we are waiting for you.
- I'm coming!

591
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:34,199
- Are you leaving again?
- I have to, mommy.

592
01:19:34,279 --> 01:19:36,960
What's wrong? I'm so scared.

593
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:38,439
You sound like Mr. Cieślak.

594
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,960
Goodbye, mom.
I have an appointment.

595
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:50,720
I heard that Romek and Rysiek are back.

596
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,479
- Romek? Wait!
- Later, mommy!

597
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:40,880
Where are you going, Mr. Cieślak?

598
01:22:10,359 --> 01:22:12,520
What are you doing here?

599
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:14,760
Can't you see?

600
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:17,399
Yes, but you have always been so...

601
01:22:17,479 --> 01:22:20,039
- Careful, you meant to say.
- Right.

602
01:22:20,119 --> 01:22:23,119
Nothing has changed.
Germans know everything.

603
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:25,399
I guess so.
Aren't you scared?

604
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:26,800
Me?

605
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,279
Boys, come here!

606
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:20,600
Tanks are coming from the station!

607
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:22,600
Destroy them!

608
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:14,800
Jesus Christ!

609
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,159
They're coming at us!

610
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,680
Can you hear them playing?

611
01:24:34,199 --> 01:24:36,159
I wish their chests would play like this.

612
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,640
- What's going on up there?
- It's all fine and dandy, sir.

613
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:00,319
We came to breathe some fresh air.

614
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:02,279
Will they survive?

615
01:25:02,359 --> 01:25:05,399
Don't be upset. Everything is fine,
seriously.

616
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:52,239
<i>And you sob through the night?</i>

617
01:25:52,439 --> 01:26:00,600
<i>The song, the only song
I sing it for you, my girl</i>

618
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:08,359
<i>It broke out from a young chest
In a great internal struggle</i>

619
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:16,199
<i>And followed the army
Someone's heart full of love</i>

620
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:24,520
<i>A soldier was marching along the road
He felt sorry for this little heart</i>

621
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:32,479
<i>So he put in his backpack
And he kept moving</i>

622
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:39,720
<i>The song, the only song
I sing it for you, my girl</i>

623
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:48,520
<i>Maybe your heart full of love
Is at loss too</i>

624
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:56,039
<i>Maybe you keep your love in secret?
And you sob through the night?</i>

625
01:26:56,640 --> 01:27:00,439
<i>The song, the only song...</i>

626
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,319
- Romek!
- Howdy, Halinka!

627
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:06,560
I finally found you!

628
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:09,079
You look nice!

629
01:27:09,159 --> 01:27:13,039
I feel great.
I'm just a little tired.

630
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:14,640
Sit down.

631
01:27:15,319 --> 01:27:16,800
How's mum?

632
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,319
Very good so far.

633
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:30,119
But where's Rysiek?

634
01:28:19,680 --> 01:28:22,600
Don't cry, Halinka.

635
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:31,439
I'm not crying. I'm singing.

636
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:43,000
<i>The song, the only song
I sing it for you, my girl</i>

637
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:35,319
The Uprising was over.
And the song of Warsaw went silent.

638
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:42,439
And the crowds of the exiles were
only followed by the mournful chords

639
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:49,159
of its last song called
"With the smokes of Fires".

640
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:54,840
Radio speakers used to sing it to us
during the last days the of the Uprising

641
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:58,279
as a consolation...

642
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:24,960
Pruszków... Pruszków...

643
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,000
Train to Oświęcim...
Detrain...

644
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:35,920
Aussteigen... Birkenau... Oświęcim...
Dachau...

645
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:38,680
- Aussteigen...
- Calm down!

646
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:42,319
- Birkenau... Oświęcim...
- Quiet...

647
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:44,319
- Dachau...
- Hush, hush...

648
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:46,359
Detrain...

649
01:32:46,439 --> 01:32:49,039
- Aussteigen! -
- Franuś, calm down!

650
01:32:49,119 --> 01:32:53,439
- Aussteigen...
- Quiet, quiet...

651
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:03,279
Yes. It is a miracle that we did not
go mad as he did.

652
01:33:04,439 --> 01:33:07,319
Thank you. That's enough.

653
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:13,119
So many killed. So many crippled.

654
01:33:15,079 --> 01:33:17,319
The hell on Earth.

655
01:33:17,399 --> 01:33:25,039
Pruszków... Pruszków...
Detrain... aussteigen...

656
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:28,840
Thank you, madam.

657
01:33:38,199 --> 01:33:39,880
Mr. Antoni!

658
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:44,159
Mrs. Halinka!

659
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:46,600
You're alive!

660
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:51,960
Yes, for now.
We'll see...

661
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:56,880
Our tenement house turned
into a pile of debris.

662
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:00,319
Yes. I saw it.

663
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:03,279
I am the only survivor.

664
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:07,640
Your mum was right to move
to her relatives

665
01:34:07,720 --> 01:34:12,119
in Poznańska Street a week before.
Is she here?

666
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:26,880
Would you like some hot coffee?

667
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:29,600
No. Thank you.

668
01:34:30,119 --> 01:34:31,439
You need it more than me.

669
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,079
It's not for me. It's for the sick man.

670
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,520
You know him. It's the musician
who used to visit you.

671
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,239
He's lying there.

672
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:51,000
And you are here too!

673
01:34:51,079 --> 01:34:53,000
Don't get up.

674
01:34:54,239 --> 01:34:56,760
We did good out there, huh?

675
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:00,880
I can't even dream about my violin.

676
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:04,880
Each man has his own misfortunes.

677
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,039
- Ten or more.
- Thank you.

678
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:17,199
I can't believe you didn't go
into captivity!

679
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:19,159
To the Germans? Voluntarily?

680
01:35:19,239 --> 01:35:23,119
I prefer the incertitude about the future.

681
01:35:23,199 --> 01:35:25,439
And Roman? How is he?

682
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:29,239
He got to the other side of Vistula,
to his men.

683
01:35:29,319 --> 01:35:31,079
That's good.

684
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:34,600
Can you hear it?

685
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:39,359
Their cannons are playing on Praga.

686
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:43,520
Our cannons.

687
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,359
Fire!

688
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,319
Fire!

689
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:28,800
And then, a wonderful return
from Warsaw to Berlin.

690
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,319
With a forbidden song on our lips.

691
01:36:31,399 --> 01:36:33,800
It was not forbidden anymore.

692
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,560
The song is free, just as we are,
just as Warsaw is.

693
01:36:38,439 --> 01:36:39,920
Well, guys?

694
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:48,680
<i>The song, the only song
I sing it for you, my girl</i>

695
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:57,800
<i>Maybe your heart full of love
Is at loss too</i>

696
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:07,119
<i>Maybe you keep your love in secret?
And you sob through the night?</i>

697
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:16,600
<i>The song, the only song
I sing it for you, my girl</i>

698
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:29,239
<i>From beyond the mountains and rivers
We got to the shore</i>

699
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:38,359
<i>How far we are to
The singing willows, lovely fields?</i>

700
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:47,319
<i>Yesterday rag, Today a uniform
Tighten your belt. It's time to go!</i>

701
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:56,039
<i>Ahead our First Corps!
From beyond the mountains to the West!</i>

702
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:10,399
THE END
