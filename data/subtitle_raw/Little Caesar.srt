1
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,154
How's that?

2
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,995
Gotta hand it to you, Rico.
The old bean's working all the time.

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,037
-What'll it be, gents?
-Spaghetti and coffee for two.

4
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,032
All right, sir.

5
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,549
''Underworld pays respects
to Diamond Pete Montana. ''

6
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,711
What's that gotta do
with the price of eggs?

7
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,438
Plenty.

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,399
Diamond Pete Montana.

9
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,678
He don't have to waste his time
on cheap gas stations.

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,196
He's somebody. He's in the big town
doing things in a big way.

11
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,512
And look at us. Just a couple
of nobodies, nothing.

12
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,399
ls that what you want, Rico?
A party like that for you?

13
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,913
''Caesar Enrico Bandello.

14
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,638
Honored by his friends. ''

15
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,553
l could do all the things
that fella does and more.

16
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,837
Only l never got my chance.
And what's there to be afraid of?

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,833
When l get in a tight spot,
l shoot my way out of it. Why, sure.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,116
Shoot first and argue afterwards.

19
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,078
You know, this game
ain't for guys that's soft.

20
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,637
Yeah, there's money
in the big town, all right.

21
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,911
And the women. Good times,
something doing all the time.

22
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,310
Exciting things, you know.

23
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,990
The clothes l could wear.

24
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,195
And then l'd quit, Rico.

25
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,318
l'd go back to dancing,
like l used to before l met you.

26
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,074
l don't know. l ain't made
for this sort of thing.

27
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,719
Dancing.

28
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,359
That's what l wanna do.

29
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,033
Dancing?

30
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,633
Women?

31
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,519
And where do they get you?
l don't want no dancing.

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,875
l'm figuring on making
other people dance.

33
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,715
-Oh, l ain't forgetting about the money.
-Money's okay, but it ain't everything.

34
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,032
Be somebody. Look hard at guys and
know they'll do anything you tell them.

35
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,839
Have your own way or nothing.
Be somebody.

36
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,838
-You'll get there, Rico.
-Yeah.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,389
-You'll show them.
-You know. . .

38
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,030
. . .this was our last stand
in this burg. We're pulling out.

39
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,914
-Where are we going?
-East.

40
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,559
Where things break big.

41
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,158
So l beat it east, like l told you.

42
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,276
That's all there is to it.

43
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,029
l wanna run with your mob,
if you'll let me. What do you say?

44
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,237
You won't be sorry for letting me in.

45
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,994
l'll do anything you say.
l ain't afraid of nothing.

46
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,639
You think you're a hard guy?

47
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,678
There's nothing soft about me.
Nothing yellow. l don't quit.

48
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,674
-You got an idea you're good, huh?
-Give me a chance to show you.

49
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,797
-What do you know about me?
-Oh, l heard plenty.

50
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,030
How you run things this end of town.

51
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,510
About this here Club Palermo,
how it's your front. l got told enough.

52
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,911
-l guess you're good with a rod too?
-Quick with it and sure.

53
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,756
Well, that don't go around here.
That's old stuff. This ain't the sticks.

54
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,271
Yeah, l get you.

55
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,994
All right. You stick around.

56
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,311
But, remember, l'm the boss.
And l give all the orders.

57
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,836
And when we split,
we split my way.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,278
-And no squawks. You get me?
-Yeah, sure, Mr. Vettori.

59
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,672
-All right, come on in, meet the boys.
-Sure.

60
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,755
Oh, they're 1 00 percent, all right.
Every one of them.

61
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,279
There's Tony Passa. Can drive
a car better than any mug in the town.

62
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,638
Otero. He's little,
but he's the goods all right.

63
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,552
Bat Carilla.

64
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,233
Killer Peppi.

65
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,038
Kid Bean.

66
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,398
And this one here, Scabby.
What a smart guy he is.

67
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,719
Boys.

68
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,552
Come on, Tony. Wake up.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,833
l want you to meet a new guy
what's gonna be with us.

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,991
This is. . . .

71
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,399
Caesar Enrico Bandello.

72
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,391
Oh, Little Caesar, huh?

73
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,595
Yeah, sure.

74
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,469
Where did you get
the new dancer, De Voss?

75
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,871
Olga brought him around
a few days ago.

76
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,712
Not bad.

77
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,431
-All right.
-l'll say he is.

78
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,355
Well, l got hold of a real dancer
for a partner, didn't l, Mr. De Voss?

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,833
He's an elegant dancer.
We'll panic them after a few rehearsals.

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,072
Say, you're not trying to sell him
to me, are you, Olga?

81
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,152
Well, young fella, l guess
1 00 a week ought to buy you.

82
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,390
That's more than l generally start with.

83
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,711
That's swell with me, even though
it don't buy no limousines.

84
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,395
Gee, thanks, Mr. De Voss.
You'll never be sorry for this.

85
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,152
Come, Joey.

86
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,430
So it's you and me from now on.

87
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,150
Well, l'm glad.

88
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,550
And l'm not ashamed to tell you.

89
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,158
l guess you know by this time
how l feel about you.

90
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,276
That's all right with you, isn't it?

91
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,115
Or have you got another girl?
A steady, l mean.

92
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,154
Hundreds of them, sure. Only. . . .

93
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,112
Only, what's the difference?

94
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,952
This is gonna be real.

95
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,432
-We'll make it mean something.
-Yeah, Joey, let's.

96
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,956
Because l need somebody.
Somebody like you.

97
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,917
Awful bad.

98
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,390
-You believe me, Olga?
-l want to believe you.

99
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,593
What's that?

100
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,588
What you got there, Joe?

101
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,837
What are you doing with that?

102
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,556
Can't you forget you've seen it?

103
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,236
lt won't make no difference.
Not between us, Olga.

104
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,469
Don't worry, baby.

105
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,677
lt's just a little good-luck charm
l carry around with me.

106
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,558
ls that your racket?

107
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,519
Maybe.

108
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,792
l suppose l got no right to ask you, Joe.

109
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,752
But now. . . .

110
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,196
Now that we got an understanding.

111
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,999
Couldn't you leave it?

112
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,159
No.

113
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,834
l suppose l haven't got the right.

114
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,869
What would be the good
of you asking, kid?

115
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,951
Once in a gang. . . .

116
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,114
-You know the rest.
-l don't want to know.

117
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,919
Only maybe. . . .

118
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,514
Maybe it could be different this time.

119
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,874
lf we try.

120
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,839
l've never seen the guy that could
get away with it yet.

121
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,359
Black. Seven.

122
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,191
Sam Vettori is still waiting
for you in your office.

123
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,352
All right, l guess l'll have to see him.

124
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,995
l wonder what he wants here.

125
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,873
Hey, Ritz.

126
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,360
You'd better stick with me.
l'll need you in there.

127
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,798
-That Sam Vettori's a no-good lug.
-You said it, boss.

128
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,269
Better let me go first.

129
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,549
Cut that.

130
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,397
Hello, Arnie.

131
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,558
Surprised to see me
in your swell joint?

132
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,239
Maybe l won't be after you
tell me what you want here.

133
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,431
Oh, l'll tell you, all right.

134
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,512
Diamond Pete asked me to come up.
He's coming up too.

135
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,033
-Pete Montana?
-That's who.

136
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,233
Well, if Pete wants you here,
it's got to be all right with me.

137
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,034
-Hello, Mr. Montana.
-Hello.

138
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,669
Hello.

139
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,317
-Hello, Arnie.
-Hello, how are you?

140
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,436
-Hello, Vettori.
-Hello, boss.

141
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,158
Cigar?

142
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,873
Thanks.

143
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,389
Thanks, Arnie.

144
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,279
Sit down, boys.
l got something to tell you.

145
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,040
A message from the Big Boy.

146
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,078
Now, listen. Here's the lowdown.

147
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,351
-The Big Boy says--
-Just a minute, boss.

148
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,238
Hey, you.

149
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,039
Nobody asked you
to be butting in here, did they?

150
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,475
-Screw, mug.
-You ain't giving me orders.

151
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,871
-You're a fresh guy, huh?
-Take it easy, Rico.

152
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,712
You go out there and wait for me.

153
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,191
Jake with me, boss.

154
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,637
Now, listen, boys.
Watch this guy McClure. . .

155
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,518
. . .what's head of the
new crime commission.

156
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,434
He's putting the screws on,
and make no mistake about him.

157
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,556
Now, the Big Boy wants me
to tell you guys. . .

158
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,757
. . .to put the chains on your gorillas
for the next few months.

159
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,550
Because if any of them go too far,
it'll be just too bad.

160
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,154
l've never seen nobody
the Big Boy couldn't get to.

161
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,949
He can fix anything.
That's why he's the Big Boy.

162
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,475
This bird McClure will be pie for him.

163
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,189
-He'll twist him around his little finger.
-Don't kid yourself.

164
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,911
Nobody's squaring nothing with McClure.
Not even the Big Boy.

165
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,071
Small jobs, that's different.

166
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,074
We could spring guys for them.
But shooting?

167
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,798
No, sir.

168
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,317
lt's guys like this torpedo of yours
that cause all the trouble.

169
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,791
Who, Rico?

170
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,756
He's all right. He's a little quick on the
trigger, but that's because he's new.

171
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,708
Yeah? Well, it's us
that'll swing for him. . .

172
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,270
. . .if he shoots
at the wrong time.

173
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,070
Now, remember what l told you.
Come on. So long.

174
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,438
And you.

175
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,797
You take it easy
with that cannon of yours.

176
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,472
Did you hear me?

177
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,199
Yes, Mr. Montana.

178
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,279
-Good night.
-Good night.

179
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,556
-Good night.
-Good night.

180
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,155
Do yourself a favor, will you, Rico?

181
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,232
Leave your gat home on the piano
the next job you pull.

182
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,198
Yeah, park it next to your milk bottle.

183
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,750
Hey. Run your own mob, Arnie.
l'll take care of mine.

184
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,876
Yeah, l'll park it.

185
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,272
l don't need no cannon to take care
of guys like you, Mr. Lorch.

186
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,556
Yeah, we gotta be careful.

187
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,995
Little Arnie's interested
in this here nightclub.

188
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,391
-lf it ever gets out who pulled the job--
-They'll never get wise to us.

189
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,949
They're careless,
but they've never been tapped.

190
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,190
Yeah, but l don't like
the whole business.

191
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,193
Neither do l, Sam. Honest, l don't.

192
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,113
l couldn't sleep last night.
l was up worried.

193
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,795
l don't want to take any chances. Not
now the way they're closing down on us.

194
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,837
What's the matter, Tony, getting yellow?

195
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,560
No, but, jeez, none of us
wanna hang, do we?

196
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,871
You'd like to quit, wouldn't you?
You'd like to run out on us.

197
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,191
-You're yellow, you dirty--
-Wait a minute, Rico.

198
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,796
Where do you get that yellow stuff?

199
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,028
You want to know who's yellow,
l'll tell you.

200
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,760
Joe Massara, your pal.

201
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,832
-That's why he didn't show tonight.
-He'll be here. Just because--

202
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,911
l know all about that stuff.

203
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,469
l'm gonna give him 1 0 minutes more.
Then we'll see.

204
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,110
Now, listen, Sam, Joe's all right.
He's the best front man in the world.

205
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,193
Why, he can go to a swell hotel and
order a suite, a suite, and it's all right.

206
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,158
Without Joe, we can't pull the job,
and you know it.

207
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,117
What's that paper?

208
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,189
lt's this layout l've been
figuring out with Scabby.

209
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,191
-What, this nightclub job?
-Yeah.

210
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,635
Well, let me see it.

211
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,952
And until l say different. . .

212
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,271
. . .nobody's gonna plan
for this mob but me.

213
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,351
You get me?

214
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,595
He'll learn.
Now, come here, you guys.

215
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,788
Now, get this.

216
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,992
Hello, Joe.

217
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,992
Hello, Rico.

218
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,273
Come here.

219
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,629
l told you to be here at 8:30.

220
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,915
Oh, well, you see, l--

221
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,594
l was busy.
l was rehearsing, and. . . .

222
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,149
-Oh, you know how it is.
-Yeah, l know how it is.

223
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,834
They've been saying it,
only l didn't believe them.

224
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,753
They're crazy when they call you yellow.

225
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,309
Tell them they can go to--

226
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,952
Say, what's the big idea
of the rush anyway?

227
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,640
lt's a little job we need you for.

228
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,030
A little job at the Bronze Peacock.

229
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,312
What do you mean?

230
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,075
Are you trying to kid me or something?

231
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,392
How can l take the chance?
They're all my friends, they all know me.

232
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,676
That's why, they'll never suspect you.

233
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,558
Now, don't stall, Joe.

234
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,278
l ain't stalling.

235
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,150
You gotta get me out of this, Rico.
You gotta. l don't want to. . . .

236
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,235
Well, don't you see,
l'm working steady now, and. . . .

237
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,278
Can't a guy ever say he's through?

238
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,193
You're gonna be in on this,
and you'll like it.

239
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,313
The time is to be sharp midnight
on New Year's Eve.

240
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,993
l won't. l can't.

241
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,276
l can't, don't you see? l--

242
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,555
Well, gee, l--

243
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,076
-l'll be working New Year's Eve.
-Now, listen, Joe.

244
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,470
This is the joint where you're working.

245
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,074
And don't you be forgetting it, either.

246
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,792
Come on in.

247
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,631
Well, maybe it ain't so hot.

248
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,870
-Maybe we can't buck Little Arnie.
-l can.

249
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,758
You're too good, that's what.

250
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,038
Hello, Joe. You were in a big hurry
about getting here, weren't you?

251
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,076
Maybe this kind of work
ain't to your liking.

252
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,674
Joe's all right. He's in with us.

253
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,153
Yeah, l'm in with you.

254
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,872
Well, let's see, now.
Here's the way l dope this thing out.

255
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,438
l, Sam Vettori, not you, Rico,
or nobody else.

256
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,838
-That's plain, ain't it?
-Sure.

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,390
Only, who stands here?
You kind of forgot that, didn't you?

258
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,712
Hey, l'm boss on this job, not you.
Right here.

259
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,555
Smart guy, Rico.
He's got plenty of brains.

260
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,112
l tell you, l'm afraid, Otero.
l'm afraid.

261
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,113
You're crazy. Rico's coming with us.

262
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,554
Come on now, buck up.

263
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,671
And you, Joe.

264
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,673
You'll be in the lobby
and give us the high sign. . .

265
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,991
. . .if everything's on the up and up.
You get me?

266
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,039
Yeah, and if we get in a jam, you'll have
to take a chance with the rest of us.

267
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,754
Hey, quiet, quiet.

268
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,639
Holy Moses, it's Alvin McClure.

269
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,519
The crime commission buzzard.

270
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,274
Hey, De Voss. Come here.

271
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,355
What is it, Arnie? What is it?

272
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,871
Bring McClure over here,
l want to buy him a lemonade.

273
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,473
-Not tonight, some other time.
-Go on. Do as you're told.

274
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,634
Go on, De Voss, bring him here.

275
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,597
As you wish.

276
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,510
What can l order for you?

277
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,513
-Good evening, Mr. McClure.
-Good evening, De Voss.

278
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,557
-Quite a party.
-Thank you.

279
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,870
Delighted to have you with us, folks.

280
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,875
Mr. McClure, a Mr. Lorch,
a financial backer of mine. . .

281
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,439
. . .would like to meet you.

282
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,195
-May l bring him over to your table?
-Lorch? Lorch?

283
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,477
-You mean the man they call Little Arnie?
-Yes, but--

284
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,552
You say he's a financial backer
of yours?

285
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,790
-Yes, but--
-l didn't understand that a man. . .

286
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,190
. . .of his type
was connected with this place.

287
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,751
l'm sorry, De Voss, but you might
inform Mr. Lorch that we're leaving.

288
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,195
l came to this place
under a misapprehension.

289
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,316
-Now, Mr. McClure--
-l'm sorry, folks. . .

290
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,357
. . .but we'll have to go somewhere else.

291
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,955
You like my hair this way, Joey?

292
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,273
Sure.

293
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,552
l used to wear it--
Where are you going?

294
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,629
-Just to get a package of cigarettes.
-Hurry back, darling, it's almost 1 2:00. . .

295
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,360
. . .and l wanna be with you
for New Year's.

296
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,351
l'll be back in a minute.

297
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,352
-What can l get you?
-A Victor Noble.

298
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,675
Stay where you are.

299
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,868
Oh, help! Oh, God!

300
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,948
Open her up, Tony, this ain't no picnic.

301
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,680
What's the matter, Tony,
losing your nerve?

302
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,311
Come on, let's go. Let's go,
we gotta get out of here. Come on.

303
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,436
Happy New Year.

304
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,518
Why, Joe. . . .

305
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,753
Joey.

306
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,633
What is it? What's the matter?

307
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,554
Nothing.

308
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,639
lt's all right.

309
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,238
-The joint's been held up, that's all.
-Held up?

310
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,799
They. . . .

311
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,833
-They shot McClure.
-Joe.

312
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,353
-Now you know.
-lt was you.

313
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,958
-No. No, it's a lie! l--
-You shot McClure.

314
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,271
No, l didn't, l swear.
lt wasn't me that shot him. lt was--

315
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,436
l don't know who.

316
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,199
But it's our hips for this job, all right.

317
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,358
Maybe-- Maybe everything
will be all right, Joey.

318
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,318
Maybe he wasn't hurt badly.

319
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,233
But you're through with that bunch.
You don't belong, Joe.

320
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,197
You're not that kind.

321
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,590
You'll never go near them again.

322
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,638
Olga. . .

323
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,911
. . .you can't go back. . .

324
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,718
. . .on a gang.

325
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,715
Well, everything come off
all right? Tell me.

326
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,038
Everything was all right.
Only l had to take care of a guy.

327
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,758
-Who was it?
-McClure.

328
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,111
McClure.

329
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,513
You shot McClure.

330
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,798
A million guys in this town, and you
had to pick the crime commissioner.

331
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,193
What did l tell you, Rico?

332
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,874
Didn't l say to make it clean?
Didn't l say no gunplay?

333
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,315
Think l'm going to let a guy
pull a gat on me?

334
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,675
Any more of these cracks,
and this is my last job.

335
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,149
The head of the crime commission.

336
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,039
The Big Boy can't do us
no good this trip.

337
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,839
They'll get us dead sure now.

338
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,675
-What am l gonna do?
-Why don't you go and give yourself up?

339
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,239
You're slipping, Sam.

340
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,675
And Tony, what about him?
Where is he?

341
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,037
Getting rid of the car.
Tony got nervous. He's like a big baby.

342
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,680
What a fine pickle we're in.

343
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,268
You and that rod of yours.

344
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,320
Flaherty's downstairs,
a couple of dicks with him.

345
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,913
They're coming right up.

346
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,957
Stay where you are, all of you.

347
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,510
They won't know nothing unless they
picked Tony up. Give them the shaft.

348
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,637
l'll be in here listening.

349
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,752
Happy New Year, boys.

350
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,196
Say, there's a lonesome
touring car down the street.

351
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,557
l was wondering if you happened
to know anything about it.

352
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,757
How should l know anything about it?

353
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,754
-Ain't it got license plates on it?
-Yes, but they're phony.

354
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,639
lt was stolen on the north side tonight.

355
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,076
Oh, l got a good café business.

356
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,800
l don't know nothing about automobiles
what's been stolen.

357
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,997
Well, you might if some of the
bright young men around here. . .

358
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,879
. . .had anything to do with it,
wouldn't you?

359
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,869
-Wasn't there anybody in it?
-Yes, one guy.

360
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,430
But not when we got there. He beat it.

361
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,557
But we got a good description
of him, though.

362
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,594
l'm telling you,
l don't know nothing about it.

363
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,111
Well, come on, fellas.

364
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,353
As long as Vettori
doesn't know anything about it.

365
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,196
Oh, say, have you heard
the news, Vettori?

366
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,432
No, what?

367
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,912
Someone knocked off Alvin McClure
over at the Bronze Peacock.

368
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,557
McClure? No, that's terrible.

369
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,277
Some guys are sure careless
with the lead, all right.

370
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,998
What a tough break for Arnie.

371
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,358
lt's gonna be a tough break
for a lot of birds.

372
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,240
Well, so long.

373
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,556
Oh, l forgot to wish you fellas
a merry Christmas.

374
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,594
Tony, l can't figure him.
The kid's a great driver.

375
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,957
-Oh, he must've lost his nerve.
-l'll take care of him.

376
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,720
-Let's see the color of that money.
-Just a minute, Sam.

377
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,111
l got my own ideas of a split.
And you can take it or leave it.

378
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,556
-We ain't begging you.
-Yeah, well l bossed this job. . .

379
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,551
. . .and l'm gonna get my split.

380
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,190
How'd you boss this job?
By sitting here cheating at solitaire?

381
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,193
Well, that don't go no more,
not with me. We're done.

382
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,194
-l've taken orders from you too long.
-You'll keep on taking orders too. . .

383
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,035
-. . .or you'll get out of here so fast. . . .
-Maybe it won't be me that gets out.

384
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,636
No? Well, maybe the boys
have got something to say about that.

385
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,358
What about it?

386
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,716
So, that's it, huh?

387
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,236
Yeah, that's it, all right.

388
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,116
You can dish it out, but you're getting
so you can't take it no more.

389
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,872
You're through.

390
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,359
Well?

391
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,909
Well, the split's okay with me, Rico.

392
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,957
How about you boys?

393
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,994
No hard feelings, Sam?

394
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,591
We gotta stick together.

395
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,196
There's a rope around my neck
right now, and they only hang you once.

396
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,715
lf anybody turns yellow and squeals. . .

397
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,394
. . .my gun's gonna speak its peace.

398
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,559
What's the matter, Antonio?

399
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,870
Why you don't sleep?

400
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,119
-You sick, maybe?
-Yeah.

401
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,078
-Oh, what--
-No, can't a guy get up when he wants. . .

402
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,071
. . .without answering a lot of questions?

403
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,800
You stay out late nights,
you drink lot of wine.

404
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,236
-Leave me alone.
-Oh, listen, Antonio, l--

405
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,997
l have some spaghetti for you
on the stove.

406
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,515
lf you feel better, eat some.

407
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,353
Yes? lt do you good.

408
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,476
You used to be a good boy, Antonio.

409
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,870
Remember when you sing in the church?

410
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,474
ln the choir with Father McNeil?

411
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,309
You in white.

412
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,038
Remember?

413
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,318
Father McNeil.

414
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,555
The church was beautiful.

415
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,678
You little boy with long hair.

416
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,229
The tall, big candles.

417
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,152
Flowers.

418
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,200
Remember, Antonio?

419
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,475
Don't leave me, Ma, do you hear?

420
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,879
You don't have to go now, do you?

421
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,076
Can't you stay a little while with me?

422
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,832
Please, don't go away.

423
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,788
-Please.
-Oh, Antonio. Oh, my baby.

424
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,394
l no go, l stay.

425
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,437
Antonio.

426
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,558
Oh, my boy.

427
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,516
l'll be all right, Ma.

428
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,829
-You'd better run along, do you hear?
-Yes.

429
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,672
You run along.

430
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,794
Take good care of yourself, will you?

431
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,072
And give my love
to Miss Manccia, will you?

432
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,150
Father McNeil.

433
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,072
Hey, Tony. Where you been?
l'm looking all over for you.

434
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,158
Rico wants you to come
and get your split.

435
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,519
What's the matter, Tony?
Don't you want a split?

436
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,752
Are you crazy?

437
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,273
l'm not crazy.

438
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,510
And l don't want no split.

439
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,633
Listen, Tony.

440
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,870
Rico knows you lose your nerve.

441
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,792
Now, he wants you to be a man.

442
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,837
You better not turn yellow.

443
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,195
Get away from me, Otero.
Leave me alone!

444
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,715
Listen, kid. l'm trying to tell you
for your own good.

445
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,711
Come with me and get your split.

446
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,279
Hey, Tony!

447
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,078
Tony, where you going?

448
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,754
l'm going to see Father McNeil.

449
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,116
Rico!

450
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,032
l found Tony, but it's too late.

451
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,633
He's crazy! Crazy!

452
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,837
l tell him to be a man, but he shakes
his head and goes to the priest.

453
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,151
Well, l guess that's that.
We ain't got any time to lose.

454
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,072
Come on, Sam, get a car, and let's go.

455
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,196
Not me! Take-- Take Scabby.

456
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,918
-Scabby's no good.
-No. l'm not.

457
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,399
-Can you drive, Otero?
-Sure!

458
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,279
All right, let's go.
We'll use the black roadster.

459
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,351
There he is.

460
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,993
Tony!

461
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,638
Did you see all them wreaths?

462
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,155
That hearse is sure decked out pretty.

463
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,198
Well, this was no time
to be tight with money.

464
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,557
Tony deserved a swell send-off.

465
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,871
-Poor kid.
-Yeah, but Rico's wreath beat them all.

466
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,632
lt was big.

467
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,075
And all it had on it was ''Tony. ''

468
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,631
-Not even Rico's name.
-Yeah. Rico's no braggart.

469
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,519
Tony looked like he was asleep.

470
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,069
Didn't look a bit changed.

471
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,310
Beats me how they do it.

472
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,516
Got a match?

473
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,310
Look, Rico. There's Flaherty, the bull.

474
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,310
Things must be getting pretty hot.
What's he want?

475
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,994
He's just stalling.
They ain't got a thing on me.

476
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,634
Gee, we're moving slow.

477
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,874
We got plenty of time.
The banquet won't start until 8.

478
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,792
Yeah.

479
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,119
Too bad Tony won't be there.

480
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,234
Yeah, that's the goods, all right.
That's the fanciest l've ever seen, Sam.

481
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,960
Look at those
little turtledoves down here.

482
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,475
Friendship and loyalty, huh?

483
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,313
-Well, how do you like that, Sam?
-Pretty good, Rico.

484
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,199
Otero told me l don't look good
in a derby. What do you think?

485
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,032
-Looks just like you.
-l thought so.

486
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,192
l guess l'll stick to them from now on.

487
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,793
''Compliments to a true pal.

488
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,110
Mr. C. Bandello from a true pal. . .

489
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,840
. . .Mr. Sam Vettori. '' Well, that's nice.

490
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,753
l appreciate, Sam. That's swell of you.

491
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,718
What's the matter with you birds?

492
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,076
Don't you know
how to act at a banquet?

493
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,038
What do you think you are,
a lot of gashouse yaps?

494
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,634
Well, cut the chatter.

495
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,510
Scabby's gonna make a speech.

496
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,039
Well, folks. . .

497
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,668
. . .you all know what we're here for. . .

498
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,549
. . .so what's the good of me
telling you all about it?

499
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,355
Rico here is a great guy!

500
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,109
Sure, and. . . .

501
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,111
Well. . . .

502
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,599
Say, Rico. . .

503
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,389
. . .l don't know how to talk fancy, but. . . .

504
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,837
This here watch is for you, see?

505
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,472
-From the boys!
-Come on, everybody. Clap, like.

506
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,914
Speech!

507
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,310
Oh, no, no, no.

508
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,229
-Speech!
-Oh, well.

509
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,958
All right.

510
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,236
You birds want me to make a speech?

511
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,311
Here it goes.

512
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,431
l-- l want to thank you, fellas,
for this here banquet.

513
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,875
lt sure is swell.

514
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,397
The liquor is good, so they tell me.

515
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,869
But l don't drink it, myself.

516
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,749
And the food don't leave
nothing to be desired.

517
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,557
Well, l guess we're all
having a swell time. . .

518
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,191
. . .and it sure is good to see
all you gents with your molls here.

519
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,352
Yeah.

520
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,873
Well, l. . . .

521
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,600
l guess that's about all.

522
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,080
And l wish you birds wouldn't get
drunk and raise Cain. . .

523
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,800
. . .because that's the way
a lot of birds get bumped off.

524
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,871
Yeah. Lay off that stuff.
l know what l'm--

525
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,794
A couple of newspaper guys wanna take
a picture. What do you say, boss?

526
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,757
Well, what do you think of that, huh?

527
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,036
Sure. Send them in.
Tell them to make it snappy.

528
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,952
-l'll see you later.
-Oh, don't go away.

529
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,430
-We're going to have our pictures taken.
-l haven't had my picture taken. . .

530
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,272
. . .in the last 1 5 years.

531
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,269
Well, what do you think of that?
1 5 years, he hasn't--

532
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,396
Come on, boys, make it snappy.

533
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,792
Come on, now! Quiet, everybody!

534
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,358
We're gonna get mugged!

535
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,153
There you are. Now, hold it.

536
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,076
Hold it, still!

537
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,914
Look at the guys over there.

538
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,196
That was a bad play
you made then, Rico.

539
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,793
That flashlight.

540
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,952
-They might pick you up on that.
-Well, what do l care?

541
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,429
Don't l want folks to see
what the boys think of me?

542
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,435
Hey, Rico, what become of that pal
of yours, that dancer guy, Joe Massara?

543
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,997
He didn't come.

544
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,508
He ain't been around in a long time.

545
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,955
He didn't quit on you, did he, Rico?

546
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,316
Bad business to quit on me, Sam.

547
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,636
One guy tried that on me once.

548
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,272
Now, you mind your own business
and let me tend to my own.

549
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,951
What does that bull want in here?

550
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,557
-l'll show him where he gets off.
-Careful, Rico.

551
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,350
Who invited you here?

552
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,313
You're getting up in the world,
aren't you, Rico?

553
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,315
The downstairs is open to anybody,
even cops.

554
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,754
But the upstairs is private.

555
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,670
Thanks, but l like to keep
my eye on you, Rico.

556
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,671
You see, l'm your friend.

557
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,599
l like to see a young fellow
getting up in the world. . .

558
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,591
. . .that's all.

559
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,909
So long.

560
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,113
Hurry back.

561
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,034
l will.

562
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,392
Oh, say. . . .

563
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,115
Somebody threw a brick through
Meyer Blum's window last night.

564
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,272
Do you happen to know anything
about a diamond-and-platinum watch. . .

565
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,476
. . .that was stolen, do you?

566
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,151
lf you hear anything about it,
let me know, won't you?

567
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,319
Banquet, eh?

568
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,155
Rico got far. . .

569
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,433
. . .too far.

570
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,556
So now, he's got to stop.

571
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,278
l'm saying he's got to stop!

572
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,273
Oh, Arnie, are you
fellas going to start another scrap?

573
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,830
What's the use of my paying heavy dues
for protection if there's no peace?

574
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,195
Don't worry.
There'll be peace soon enough.

575
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,594
l'm saying he's got to stop,
so he's gonna stop.

576
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,830
He's been cutting in on my territory. . .

577
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,752
. . .and that's all wet with me.

578
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,479
Look.

579
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,795
l'm sitting here, see?

580
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,030
l'm sitting here quiet. . .

581
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,555
. . .smoking a cigarette, see?

582
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,837
But a couple of my boys
ain't sitting here.

583
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,749
They're out looking for Rico, and they
got their gats with them too. Catch on?

584
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,834
And when they find him,
it won't be no banquet that Rico gets.

585
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,228
lt will be a wake!

586
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,755
Arnie, you know best.

587
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,549
l've never met Rico.

588
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,511
Phelps, 2284.

589
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,592
Hello, Otero. This is Joe Massara.

590
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,478
l just found out something.
This is hot.

591
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,757
Tell Rico to look out. Little Arnie's gang
is out to put one in him.

592
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,437
What's the matter?

593
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,434
-Where is Rico?
-You got me. He ain't showed up yet.

594
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,716
Come on, quick!
We got to find him!

595
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,517
l want 1 0 of these.

596
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,510
Gee, you taking
all these papers, Mr. Rico?

597
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,636
Why, sure. Ain't l got
my picture in them?

598
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,792
Here.

599
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,349
-Thanks! Come again!
-That's all right.

600
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,312
Fine shots you are!

601
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,198
Oh, no!

602
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,709
So somebody finally put one in you.

603
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,313
Yeah, but they just grazed me.

604
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,789
The old man will be glad to hear it.

605
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,632
He takes such an interest in you.

606
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,759
Tell him the cops couldn't get me
no other way, so they hired gunmen.

607
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,718
lf l wasn't on the force,
l'd have done the job cheap.

608
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,559
Did you ever think how you'd look
with a lily in your hand?

609
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,153
No, l never did.

610
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,677
l've been in this game many years,
and l put the cuffs on a lot of mugs.

611
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,638
Someday, you and l
are gonna take a ride, Rico. . .

612
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,598
. . .and when we do,
l'll have the cuffs on you too.

613
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,197
No buzzard like you
will ever put any cuffs on Rico.

614
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,231
Come on, boys.

615
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,550
l'm gonna get that swell-headed mug
if it's the last thing l ever do.

616
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,235
Boss, l'm sorry.
l should have been with you.

617
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,029
They thought they hit the target, boss,
but bullets just bounce off of you.

618
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,877
lt was Little Arnie, Rico. Joe Massara
got the tip, and he called up.

619
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,393
We couldn't find you in time.

620
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,909
Joe, huh?

621
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,074
Well.

622
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,957
l didn't think he cared enough.

623
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,350
Well, that was white of him, all right.

624
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,829
l ought to give him a chance
on my next job.

625
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,514
There. Guess l didn't study medicine
for nothing, did l?

626
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,352
Thanks, Scabby.

627
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,110
l'm going to see Little Arnie tonight.

628
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,158
lf he's looking for trouble,
why, that's what we got the most of.

629
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,596
l want Killer Peppi,
Otero, Kid Bean and Bat to go with me.

630
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,632
Listen, handsome, open up,
or you'll tell nobody nothing no more.

631
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,348
Tell him we're all right,
and don't act nervous.

632
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,192
These fellas are all right.

633
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,673
Come on, stick them up.

634
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,114
Lock that door.

635
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,429
Where's Arnie?

636
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,919
ln the office?

637
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,435
Bat, stay outside that door
and don't let anybody in.

638
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,114
Kid, you keep them covered.
Peppi and Otero, follow me.

639
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,111
Come on, you. Give him the knock.

640
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,389
Come on! Put them up!
Put them up! Come on!

641
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,512
Hello, Arnie.

642
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,069
-How's business?
-What's the game?

643
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,358
l don't know what this is all about,
but it's a private row.

644
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:58,308
-You guys better beat it.
-Ain't nobody gonna leave this room.

645
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,869
You guys are invited
to this private party.

646
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,917
Suppose we don't want to stay?

647
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,150
l wouldn't stop you for the world.

648
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,233
Only these boys
of mine have itching fingers.

649
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,832
Sit down, gents.

650
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,439
Arnie. . .

651
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,036
. . .you ought to have better sense
than to hire a couple of outside yaps. . .

652
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,395
. . .especially bad shots.

653
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,676
Come on. What is it?
Let's have it!

654
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,909
Arnie. . .

655
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,039
. . .you're through.

656
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,714
You hire these mugs, they miss.
Now you're through.

657
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,950
lf you ain't out of town
by tomorrow morning. . .

658
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,032
. . .you won't ever leave it
except in a pine box.

659
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,549
l'm taking over this territory.

660
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,358
From now on, it's mine.

661
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,078
You're growing, Rico.

662
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,356
So this is what you've been after
all the time?

663
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,318
l seen it in your eyes
the first time l met you.

664
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,436
You're no good, Rico.

665
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,673
lf you think you can muscle in like you
did on Sam Vettori, you're off your nut!

666
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,991
l suppose you forgot
all about Pete Montana, huh?

667
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,234
How's Diamond Pete going to stop me?
He may be your boss, but he ain't mine.

668
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,311
Sam didn't feel that way about him.

669
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,675
-Sam knew who gave orders.
-Sam was too soft.

670
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,115
Diamond Pete could scare him,
but l ain't no Sam.

671
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,713
Sam is through.

672
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,110
Now you're through too.

673
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,070
Nice stickpin you got there, Arnie.

674
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,516
Nothing phony about my jewelry.

675
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,994
Arnie. . .

676
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,157
. . .you better quit this racket.

677
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,152
You can dish it out, but you got
so that you can't take it no more.

678
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,671
You'd better take your hats and beat it.

679
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,389
The first thing you know, you'll be
arrested for firing a rod in the city limits.

680
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,514
Well. . .

681
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,753
. . .l guess that's about all.

682
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,191
Pleasant trip, gents.

683
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:08,712
Come on, boys.

684
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:16,511
Oh, thanks, boys, for the artillery.

685
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,350
-Well, boys. What do you think of it?
-You're in the wrong job. lt's perfect.

686
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,636
That means you have a new partner.

687
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,831
Little Caesar.

688
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,998
Everybody'll laugh at Scabby's story.

689
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,789
Gee, boss. You gave Arnie
an awful walloping.

690
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,558
Rico. . . .

691
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,795
Now you're famous.

692
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,637
You see, Otero.

693
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,076
There ain't no use in being scared
of any of these big guys.

694
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,800
The bigger they come,
the harder they fall.

695
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,033
Yeah.

696
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,556
l ain't doing so bad
in this business so far.

697
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,878
Well, now.

698
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,871
You look great, boss.

699
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,871
Yeah, but it feels terrible.

700
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,915
You're getting up in the world, Rico.

701
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:56,152
None of us ever been invited up
to eat at the Big Boy's dump.

702
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,959
And nobody ever crashed the gate
except Pete Montana.

703
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,269
See what l mean?

704
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,796
Now, you don't want the Big Boy
to think you ain't got no class.

705
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,394
They rig you up better than this
in the stir.

706
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,790
lf you think l'm going out
in this, you're crazy!

707
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,188
You look fine, boss.

708
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,158
-Go on. Take a peek at yourself.
-Oh, l don't know.

709
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,030
All l need is a napkin over my arm.

710
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,630
Now, don't you look fine?

711
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,838
Yeah.

712
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,309
l guess maybe l don't look so bad
after all.

713
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,913
Oh, hello.

714
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,638
-Hello, Big Boy.
-Hello, Rico.

715
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,838
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

716
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,551
Thanks very much.

717
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,956
Well, you're rather
lit up tonight, aren't you?

718
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,710
Yeah. l thought l better put on
a monkey suit.

719
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,189
That's right.
You may as well learn now.

720
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,509
Yeah.

721
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,949
Well. . . .

722
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,353
Some joint you got here.

723
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,472
lt'll do.

724
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:19,193
l bet all this trick furniture
set you back plenty, huh?

725
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,113
Well, they don't exactly give it away
with cigar coupons.

726
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,872
Well, l'll tell the world.

727
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,919
Boy, it sure look--

728
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,274
Oh, look at that.

729
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,639
-Do you like it?
-Oh, l think it's elegant.

730
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,591
That cost me $ 1 5,000.

731
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,997
Fifteen thou--

732
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,278
Boy, them gold frames
sure cost plenty of dough.

733
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,159
Well, will you have a cocktail
or a dash of brandy?

734
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,436
Oh, no, thanks.
l never touch the stuff.

735
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,959
No?

736
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:51,192
-Cigar, then?
-Oh, yeah. l'll have one of those.

737
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,032
Thanks.

738
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,111
Thanks very much.

739
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,359
-Sit down, Rico.
-Yeah. Thanks.

740
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,350
Now, listen, Rico.

741
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,959
l'm gonna talk to you, but you're not
gonna hear a word l say, see?

742
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:20,159
This is inside dope, and if it gets out,
it'll be just too bad for somebody.

743
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,992
You know me.

744
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,591
All right. Get this.

745
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,069
Pete Montana's through.

746
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,278
Yeah?

747
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,679
Well.

748
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,718
-And l thought he was such a big guy.
-He's through.

749
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,673
Suppose l were to tell you
that from now on. . .

750
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,273
. . .you were Pete Montana.

751
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,631
That you were to take over his territory
in addition to your own.

752
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,552
Would you shake on it?

753
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:48,914
Would l?

754
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,878
Would l?

755
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,075
All right. lt's set.

756
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:01,436
l'm doing a lot for you, Rico,
but when l get you planted. . .

757
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,636
. . .l'll expect plenty of service.

758
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:04,949
Well, you'll sure get it.

759
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,429
Permit me, then, to drink
to the new boss of the North Side.

760
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,272
Thank you.

761
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:38,198
Otero, what did l tell you, huh?

762
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,157
l knew it was coming.

763
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:46,198
l knew he had his eyes on me
all the time.

764
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,431
And let me tell you something, Otero.

765
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,149
lt's not only Pete Montana
that's through, but the Big Boy himself.

766
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,072
He ain't what he used to be.

767
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,800
Pretty soon, he won't be
able to take it, and then. . .

768
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,192
. . .watch me.

769
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,429
Sure, boss.

770
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,670
Pretty soon, you'll be running
the whole town.

771
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,956
Otero, you said a mouthful.

772
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,950
There's a guy by the name of Massara
out there. He wants to see you, sir.

773
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,234
-l'll see him in a minute.
-Yes, sir.

774
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,558
What's Joe want here? He hasn't been
near any of us for months.

775
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,119
l sent for him.

776
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,636
l heard somebody in Detroit got to
Flaherty and told him to start working. . .

777
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,793
. . .on a dancer at the Bronze Peacock if
he wanted to find out who shot McClure.

778
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,394
Gee, boss, you're wise to everything
before it happens.

779
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,073
Yeah, l don't miss much.

780
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,279
l'll find out if Flaherty's been working
on Joe after l have a little talk with him.

781
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,678
Gee, Rico, what a palace.

782
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,553
Oh, hello, Joe.

783
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,032
Yeah, it'll do.

784
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,476
But what do you expect?
Ain't l got 20 grand tied up in it?

785
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,438
-Hello, Otero. How are you, baby?
-First-rate.

786
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,035
Sit down, Joe.

787
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,395
Sure l'm good enough to sit
in such a swell chair?

788
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,710
Come on, now. Cut the comedy.
Sit down.

789
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,112
Screw, Otero.

790
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,874
-l want to talk with Joe private.
-Sure.

791
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,792
See you later, Joe.

792
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,034
-Cigar, Joe?
-No, thanks.

793
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,277
Well, will you have a cocktail
or a dash of brandy?

794
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,589
No.

795
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,078
Well, it surprise
you to hear from me?

796
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,673
Kind of.

797
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,236
l thought it would be kind of nice
to have a little talk together. . .

798
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,833
. . .like old times.

799
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,031
Certainly is nice to see you, Rico.

800
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,838
Especially like this.

801
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,197
-You're looking good.
-You're looking good too, Joe.

802
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,271
Living easy, kind of, huh?

803
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:58,319
-Not that easy. Dancing's no cinch.
-Yeah, but you ain't complaining.

804
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,389
-No. No, l ain't complaining.
-That's good.

805
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,033
Yeah.

806
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,395
Dancing's all right for a sideline.

807
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,676
lt gives you a swell front.

808
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,592
But it ain't my idea of a man's game.

809
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,159
What's the difference, Rico?

810
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:18,076
As long as l ain't kicking,
why should you kick?

811
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,434
Who's kicking?

812
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,310
Only why should a young guy
like you be wasting his time?

813
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:29,237
And l kind of took pride in you, Joe. . .

814
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,630
. . .brought you into the gang,
pushed you ahead.

815
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,597
But now you're getting to be a sissy.

816
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,433
We got to go into that again?
Can't you just forget about me?

817
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,388
l don't want to forget, Joe. You're my
pal. We started off together, didn't we?

818
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,596
We've got to keep going along together.

819
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,591
Who else do l got to give a hang about?

820
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,159
l need you, Joe.

821
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,038
l've got the biggest chance of my life.

822
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,634
The Big Boy just handed me
the whole North Side. . .

823
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,837
. . .but it's too much for one man
to handle alone. l need somebody.

824
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:58,436
-A guy like you, somebody l can trust.
-Can't be me, Rico.

825
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,192
l've quit.

826
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,318
You didn't quit.

827
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,311
Nobody ever quit me.

828
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,277
You're still in my gang, you got that?

829
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,238
l don't care how many fancy skirts
you've got hanging on to you.

830
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,709
That jane's made a softy out of you.

831
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,474
-You lay off Olga.
-l ain't laying off. l'm after her!

832
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,110
One of us has to lose, and it won't be
me. There's ways of stopping that dame.

833
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,392
-You're crazy. Leave her out of this!
-She's through, out of the way.

834
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,755
-You're lying. You wouldn't dare!
-l wouldn't?

835
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,990
-l'll show you!
-Rico, listen.

836
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,720
We're in love with one another.
Don't that mean nothing?

837
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,393
Nothing. Less than nothing.

838
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,120
Love. Soft stuff!

839
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,669
When she's got you,
you ain't no good for anything.

840
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,068
We ain't out of this yet. . .

841
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,510
. . .and we don't want no softies
spilling things!

842
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,830
l won't spill anything,
if you're scared of that.

843
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,719
-You think l want my neck stretched?
-Well, you know too much.

844
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:50,429
l ain't gonna take any chances.
You're hanging around with me, see?

845
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,477
No, l'm not.

846
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,833
All right.

847
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,271
You go back to that dame. . .

848
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,271
. . .and it's suicide.

849
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,715
Suicide for both of you.

850
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,558
Just stick here.

851
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,909
Hello?

852
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:16,150
Oh, hello, Big Boy.

853
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,473
No. No, l don't want that guy.
l don't trust him.

854
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,310
Yeah. l got a kid by the name
of Joe Massara who'll help me.

855
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,877
Yeah. All right, goodbye, Big Boy.

856
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,558
Oh, Joe. . . .

857
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:02,872
-Joe.
-Olga.

858
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,315
-We've gotta go. Hurry!
-Joe, what's the matter?

859
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,710
Didn't you hear what l said?
Hurry! Hurry!

860
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,269
-Yes, Joe. Oh, you're ill.
-l'm all right.

861
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,635
-Rico.
-What did he do to you?

862
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,028
Oh, didn't l know it?

863
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:16,839
He, Rico-- He said you
and me gotta quit.

864
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,514
He'd kill you unless l stuck with him.
l ran away.

865
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,559
We've got to get out of here.
Anywhere. As long as we get away!

866
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,278
No.

867
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,273
-No? You're not coming?
-No.

868
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,634
That's not the way.

869
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,711
But, Olga, you don't know that guy!

870
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:37,916
-Olga, you've got to! Please!
-No.

871
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:39,433
Sit down, Joe.

872
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:43,149
-We've got to think.
-l don't want to think or sit down.

873
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,595
-You're coming.
-Don't you see? lt would be no use!

874
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,235
Where? Where would we go?
Where would we run to?

875
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,550
There's no place he wouldn't find us.

876
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,153
There's only one thing for us to do.

877
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,834
Flaherty.

878
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,356
You're crazy.
You think that would save us?

879
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,273
Flaherty? That's worse than suicide.

880
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:05,193
-l won't do it. l can't.
-Well, l can do it.

881
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,510
That gang must go. Rico must go.

882
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,432
l want my happiness, Joe. l want you.

883
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,637
We'll never have peace till Rico's gone.
l'm going to do it.

884
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,677
Olga, don't! Please! Stay here!

885
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,314
Olga, open this door!

886
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,993
Olga, open this door! Hurry!

887
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,149
Park, 1 000.

888
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,390
Olga. Don't call Flaherty.

889
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,313
Please, open this door, quickly!
Rico will kill us both!

890
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,994
Headquarters, l want Sergeant Flaherty.

891
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,912
Sergeant Flaherty, this is Olga Stassoff.

892
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,355
l've got Joe Massara with me.
ln my apartment.

893
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,397
1 7 Edsel Drive.

894
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,472
Yes. Yes, he wants to talk to you.
Hurry, hurry!

895
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,875
Come on, boys,
we're going to a party.

896
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,274
Who's giving the party?

897
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,556
-Joe Massara.
-Formal or informal?

898
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:51,076
l don't know, but we'll find out
when we get there.

899
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,236
You shouldn't have done it.
You shouldn't have.

900
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,358
There was no other way.
No other right way.

901
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:01,758
-lt's the rope for me.
-No, it isn't.

902
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,512
Not if you turn state's evidence.

903
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,750
We'll make them promise
everything will be okay.

904
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,478
Wait, Olga!

905
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,513
-Joe!
-There he is, the dirty double-crosser.

906
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,352
Give it to him, Rico!

907
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,713
No.

908
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,033
Shoot.

909
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,112
Shoot, Rico.

910
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,352
Get it over with.

911
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,511
Come on, Otero! Let's go!

912
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,910
You're getting soft too.

913
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,391
What's the matter with you? Come on!

914
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,993
Joe.

915
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,309
-Who was it?
-Otero and Rico. Through the window!

916
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,198
Go on, boys. Go and get him!

917
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,794
Are you ready to talk now, Joe?

918
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,917
Well, l'll talk. lt was Rico's gang
that held up the Bronze Peacock.

919
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:52,559
lt was Rico who shot McClure.

920
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,518
That dirty, low, sneaking--
Well, Joe will tell you. Ask him.

921
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,636
He knows it was Rico.

922
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,439
ls that right, Joe?

923
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,875
Was it Rico?

924
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,750
-Where's your phone?
-ln there.

925
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,152
Oh, Joe. Here, let me help you.

926
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,311
Park, 1 000.

927
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,196
Hello, Dan, this is Flaherty.

928
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,839
Round up that Palermo gang.

929
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,991
l got enough on them to use
a mile of rope.

930
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:25,755
Shoot the cars right out,
and above all, get Rico.

931
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:41,272
We've gotta watch our step.
The cops are sure to be cruising around.

932
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,556
-You should have plugged Joe.
-And the dame.

933
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:46,393
lf they ain't squealed about McClure yet,
they'll do it now.

934
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:47,913
-From now on, we're hot.
-Yeah.

935
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:50,196
This is what l get
for liking a guy too much.

936
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:51,509
Come on.

937
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,269
Halt!

938
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,713
Halt!

939
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,435
Go on, Rico.

940
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,397
l'm done for.

941
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,710
Go on, Rico.

942
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,474
Sam! Sam!

943
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,950
Joe Massara! They nabbed him over
the McClure business, and he squawked.

944
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,911
Rico tried to get him.
Now they're after him. They got Otero.

945
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,957
-Otero?
-Sam, don't you get me?

946
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,588
-What are you sitting there for?
-What else can l do?

947
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,557
l can't run now.
They'd get me anyhow.

948
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,473
You're out of your head.
Come on, get up. Let's beat it!

949
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:02,868
lt's no use.

950
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,390
Put them up! Don't move!
Hand over your guns.

951
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,676
All right. Take them down to the car.

952
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,752
You'd better give up, Sam.

953
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,236
Drop that gun before we start shooting.

954
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,958
Come on in.

955
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,914
Get on your feet and put your hands up.

956
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,991
Put the cuffs on him.

957
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,951
You ain't got nothing on me.

958
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:50,838
Nothing but the bracelets.

959
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:55,429
And we haven't
got a thing on Rico, either.

960
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,870
He's next.

961
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,717
-There's nobody in there.
-No?

962
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,795
Well, listen, Ma. lf you see Rico,
you'd better let us know, quick.

963
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,354
Well. . .

964
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,437
. . .you got yourself in a nice fix.

965
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:49,238
-Yeah.
-The cops were just here.

966
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,471
They got Otero.

967
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,158
Ma, l'm gonna stay here
a day or two, then l want a car.

968
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,676
Gonna cost you big,
because l'm taking big chances.

969
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,354
l got 1 0 grand planted here.
Help yourself.

970
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,795
When you're ready to start,
l'll give you $ 1 50.

971
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,473
You'll give me?

972
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:11,074
Whose money is this?
Who do you think you're talking to?

973
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,591
l need plenty. My money is hidden
in the apartment. l can't get to it.

974
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:17,877
l'll give you $ 1 50. Take it or leave it.

975
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:20,634
Why, you dirty, thieving old hag, l'll--

976
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,233
No, you won't.

977
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,676
Because l'm the only one knows
where the money's hid.

978
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,952
Kill me, and you won't get a cent.

979
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,240
l'll give you $ 1 50. . .

980
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,960
. . .if you'll be a good boy.

981
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,429
He was mean, Sam Vettori was.

982
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,875
So now he's got
what was coming to him.

983
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,553
What does it say in the paper?

984
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,999
''Former gang chief
faints on scaffold.

985
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,549
After a futile
battle in the courts. . .

986
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:33,269
. . .Sam Vettori, former gang leader. . .

987
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,789
. . .today presented a pitiful figure. . .

988
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:40,153
. . .as the hangman's noose
was placed around his neck. ''

989
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,633
Listen. ''Little Caesar
has never been found.

990
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:52,476
According to the statement of Lieutenant
Thomas Flaherty of the homicide squad. . .

991
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,189
. . .Little Caesar, the once swaggering
braggart of the underworld. . .

992
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:02,037
. . .wilted in the face of real danger
and showed the world his cowardice.

993
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:07,394
Flaherty stated further that Little Caesar
has contradicted his oft-repeated boast. . .

994
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,710
. . .that he could dish it out
and take it too. ''

995
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,029
Yeah.

996
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,236
''When a real crisis arose. . .

997
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,749
. . .Rico couldn't take it.

998
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,957
Flaherty ended his interview
by remarking:

999
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:23,318
'Meteoric as was Rico's rise
from the gutter. . .

1000
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,230
. . .it was inevitable that
he should return there.' ''

1001
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,995
Well, just the same,
he was the real leader of that gang.

1002
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,631
Don't you believe it.

1003
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,076
Rico didn't have the nerve,
and he didn't have the brains.

1004
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,596
He was yellow,
just like Flaherty said.

1005
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,079
Here!

1006
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,037
-That's what Rico--
-Give me that paper!

1007
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,394
Hey, watch it!

1008
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:55,511
-What's the matter with him?
-Must be crazy.

1009
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,076
l'll show them where they get off.

1010
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,072
Trying to put that kind
of stuff about me in the papers, huh?

1011
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,037
l'll show them-- Hello?

1012
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,872
Hello? l want Park, 1 000.

1013
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,191
Yeah. Yeah, l can't take it
no more, huh?

1014
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:25,875
l'll tell that guy where to--
Hello? Park, 1 000?

1015
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,715
-Get me Flaherty, and get him quick.
-Sure. Just a minute.

1016
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,996
Tom. Oh, Tom.

1017
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,996
l may be screwy,
but this sounds like Rico.

1018
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,309
Yeah?

1019
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,753
-Flaherty speaking.
-Yeah, this is Rico speaking!

1020
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,909
Rico! R-l-C-O, Rico!
Little Caesar, that's who!

1021
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,197
You're a big guy, ain't you?
Shooting your mouth off in the papers.

1022
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,477
So l ran out when it got hot, huh?
l can't take it no more?

1023
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,676
Well, listen, you crummy,
flatfooted copper. . .

1024
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,592
. . .l'll show you whether
l lost my nerve.

1025
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,070
Thanks, Rico, old boy.
The same to you and many of them.

1026
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,878
Come on, tell me some more.

1027
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,395
The sound of your voice
does my heart good.

1028
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:08,279
Trace that call. Find out
where he's phoning from, quick.

1029
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,230
Say, why didn't you come to Sam's
neck-stretching party, Rico?

1030
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:15,152
lt was a big success.

1031
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,550
Funny guy, ain't you, Flaherty?

1032
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,756
Well, you ain't got
much longer to laugh.

1033
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:23,354
l'm coming, and l'm gonna put one
in your dirty hide. . .

1034
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,034
. . .for every lying crack
that you made about me, see?

1035
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:28,760
l'll show you who's gonna
finish up in the gutter.

1036
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,918
We've missed you, Rico.

1037
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,275
The town has been nice and quiet.

1038
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,271
l'm putting on weight.

1039
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:39,513
River, 6547. lt's a flophouse down
at 4th and Commercial.

1040
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,551
All right. All right, big mouth.

1041
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,518
Get your hat and start running,
see, because you're all through.

1042
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:48,036
Call the papers and tell them that,
you rotten, dirty, lying copper!

1043
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,517
l knew we'd hear from that guy if l
kept giving it to him in the papers.

1044
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:54,829
The conceit of that guy!

1045
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,549
They'll have to build a special noose
to get that swelled head of his through.

1046
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,716
Well, wish me luck.

1047
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,909
There he is. That's Rico, all right.
Pull in there.

1048
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:47,194
You'd better give up, Rico.
You haven't got a chance.

1049
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:48,759
You'll have to
come and get me.

1050
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,474
You'd better be a nice boy, Rico,
and come out.

1051
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:53,756
You heard me!
lf you want me, come and get me!

1052
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:55,876
l'll be with you in a minute.

1053
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,996
Give me that chopper.

1054
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,991
This is your last chance, Rico.

1055
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,515
Are you coming out,
or do you want to be carried out?

1056
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,516
Well, Rico, it looks like you and l
are going to take that little ride together.

1057
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,433
No. . . .

1058
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,511
No, we ain't.

1059
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:41,071
l told you a little buzzard like you
will never put any cuffs on me.

1060
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,194
You should have come out
when l told you to, Rico.

1061
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,554
Mother of mercy.

1062
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:55,438
ls this the end of Rico?
