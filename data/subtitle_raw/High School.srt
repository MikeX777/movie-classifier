00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,975
WHY DID SHE GET AN
"E" THE FIRST TIME?

175
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:43,351
IT'S COMPLETELY AGAINST
HER CHARACTER.

176
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,768
IN BEHAVIOR.

177
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:45,852
IN BEHAVIOR.

178
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:46,975
WHY DID SHE GET AN
"E" THE FIRST TIME?

179
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,685
COMPLETELY AGAINST
HER CHARACTER.

180
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:50,685
AN "E?"

181
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:52,058
YES, IN BEHAVIOR? IN BEHAVIOR.

182
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:53,894
WHAT DID SHE GET IN THERE?

183
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:55,143
AN "E."

184
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:58,058
"E" IS A GRADE, IT'S
NOT A BEHAVIOR MARK.

185
00:07:58,082 --> 00:07:59,852
DID SHE TELL, WHAT DID SHE SAY?

186
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:03,059
UH, 4, 3, THE LOWEST YOU
CAN GET, I IMAGINE.

187
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,059
WE CANNOT JUDGE RHONA'S MARK

188
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:09,975
BASED PURELY ON THIS TEACHER'S
REMARKS OF THESE PAPERS.

189
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:12,435
THIS IS ALL I'M SAYING.

190
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,226
RHONA, LIMITED IN MANY WAYS,

191
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,727
KNEW WORLD EVENTS AND
THE WORLD AROUND HER.

192
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:20,975
SHE KNEW THE DIFFERENT
FORMS OF GOVERNMENT,

193
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:23,852
THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES
OF TYPES OF GOVERNMENT.

194
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:25,226
HERE RHONA FAILED.

195
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,976
BECAUSE SHE FAILED
IN ALL THESE TESTS.

196
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,727
WE CAN ONLY JUDGE ON THE
BASIS OF PERFORMANCE.

197
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:31,975
YOU MAY HAVE HIDDEN
TALENT IN YOU, SIR,

198
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,852
BUT IF YOU DON'T PERFORM
IT, WE DON'T KNOW.

199
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:35,643
THAT'S TRUE, TRUE.

200
00:08:35,667 --> 00:08:38,434
AND THE WORLD WILL RECOGNIZE
YOU ONLY BY YOUR PERFORMANCE.

201
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:39,975
THAT'S TRUE, THAT'S TRUE.

202
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:41,976
BUT IF YOU WANT YOUR DAUGHTER

203
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,975
TO BE BASICALLY A
WELL-ADJUSTED...

204
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,351
ULTIMATELY, I'LL USE
THE WORD "HAPPINESS"

205
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,852
IN A VERY BROAD SENSE, AND
I KNOW THAT HAPPINESS

206
00:08:49,876 --> 00:08:52,810
IS NOT THE ULTIMATE THING IN
LIFE, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT...

207
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:53,976
YOU CANNOT IMPOSE

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,560
PRECONCEIVED VALUES AND DREAMS

209
00:08:56,584 --> 00:09:00,143
ON AN INDIVIDUAL,
INCLUDING A CHILD.

210
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:02,393
YOU CANNOT DO THAT.

211
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,975
BUT AGAIN, I WANT
YOU TO UNDERSTAND

212
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:07,185
THAT PART OF YOUR JOB
IS TO DEAL WITH RHONA

213
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:10,059
AS A SYMPATHETIC AND
UNDERSTANDING FATHER,

214
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,975
BUT RECOGNIZING HER LIMITATIONS

215
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,018
AND THE FACT THAT SHE IS A
PERSON IN HER OWN RIGHT,

216
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:18,975
AND THAT IF YOU IMPOSE TOO
MUCH YOUR DESIRES ON HER,

217
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:21,975
EVEN WITHOUT PUSHING
THEM OR FORCING HER,

218
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,894
SHE MAY REACT IN A WAY WHICH
MAY BE DAMAGING TO HER, TOO.

219
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:27,226
MICHAEL, THIS HAS TO
DO WITH YOUR CUTTING,

220
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,975
WHAT IS IT, PHYSICAL SCIENCE?

221
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:30,975
NO, SIR, I NEVER CUT IT.

222
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:33,351
MRS. GANIN WAS YELLING
AT ME AFTER CLASS

223
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,894
AND SHE STARTS GOING OFF.

224
00:09:35,918 --> 00:09:37,976
AND, YOU SEE, SOMEHOW I WAS
MAKING NOISE IN THE LUNCH LINE,

225
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,768
AND THE TRUTH IS, MR. ALLEN,

226
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,477
I WAS BEHAVING IN THE
BACK OF THE ROOM.

227
00:09:41,501 --> 00:09:43,768
I DIDN'T OPEN MY MOUTH BECAUSE,
SEE, THE OTHER KIDS WERE,

228
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,268
AND I DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE GOOFING OFF,

229
00:09:45,292 --> 00:09:46,975
AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS ME.

230
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:48,727
AND SHE CALLS ME UP AND
SHE STARTS YELLING AT ME,

231
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,226
AND I SAY, "IT WASN'T ME."

232
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,976
AND SHE STARTS YELLING, YELLING.

233
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,975
SO I FIGURE, MR. ALLEN...

234
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:55,852
COULD YOU STAND THERE AND
LISTEN TO A LADY YELL?

235
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:57,894
SO I FIGURE I'D GO OUT
AND TALK TO HER LATER

236
00:09:57,918 --> 00:09:59,393
WHEN SHE IS CALMED DOWN.

237
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:01,310
AND SHE WAS PRETTY WORKED UP.

238
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,935
AND I WENT TO WALK OUT AND
SHE GOES, "YOU DON'T LEAVE."

239
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,810
AND I GO, "I'LL SPEAK TO YOU
LATER AT A BETTER TIME."

240
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,975
AND I WALKED OUT BECAUSE...

241
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,059
FIRST OF ALL, MICHAEL, YOU
SHOWED POOR JUDGMENT.

242
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:13,143
WHEN YOU ARE BEING ADDRESSED
BY SOMEONE OLDER THAN YOU

243
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:16,143
OR IN A SEAT OF AUTHORITY,

244
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,768
IT'S YOUR JOB TO
RESPECT AND LISTEN.

245
00:10:17,792 --> 00:10:19,268
SHE DIDN'T ASK YOU

246
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:20,975
TO JUMP FROM THE EMPIRE
STATE BUILDING...

247
00:10:20,999 --> 00:10:22,226
SHE'S NOT ASKING YOU
FOR YOUR BLOOD.

248
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,975
SHE'S ASKING FOR A
LITTLE BIT OF TIME,

249
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,477
TO HELP YOU OUT.

250
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,059
NOW, HERE'S THE THING...
WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE

251
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,435
IS SHOWED SOME
CHARACTER BY SAYING,

252
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,810
"OKAY, I WILL GO
TO YOUR DETENTION,

253
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:33,976
"BUT MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,602
AND GET THIS MATTER CORRECTED?"

255
00:10:35,626 --> 00:10:37,226
SHE DIDN'T ASSIGN ME DETENTION.

256
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,101
WELL, ACCORDING TO THIS...

257
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:42,976
"GIVEN THE CHOICE OF A
DETENTION AT 7:30 OR AT 1:45,"

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,935
AND YOU REFUSED TO TAKE EITHER.
NOW, WHAT IS THAT?

259
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,643
THEY SENT ME DOWN TO MR. WALSH,

260
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,059
AND I TRIED TO EXPLAIN IT TO HIM

261
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,727
AND HE STARTED
YELLING AT ME, TOO.

262
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,101
WELL, NO ONE IS GOING
TO YELL AT YOU, AND...

263
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,975
WELL, I DON'T FEEL
I HAVE TO TAKE

264
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,435
ANYBODY SCREAMING
AT ME FOR NOTHING.

265
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,018
NO, NO, THERE'S A POINT TO THAT,

266
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:59,351
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,

267
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,477
IT'S TIME YOU SHOWED A LITTLE
CHARACTER ON YOUR OWN, RIGHT?

268
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:02,810
YES, SIR.

269
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:03,975
I WOULD TAKE THE DETENTION

270
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:05,393
AND THEN YOU CAN
COME BACK AND SAY,

271
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,477
"NOW, I TOOK THE DETENTION,
MAY I SPEAK WITH YOU?"

272
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:08,976
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT MAN...

273
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,435
WELL, YOU CAN TRY.

274
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:11,975
DO YOU KNOW...

275
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,268
ANOTHER TIME IN THAT CLASS,
THIS IS ANOTHER REASON WHY...

276
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:15,643
SIT DOWN.

277
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,185
THIS IS ANOTHER REASON
WHY I WON'T TAKE IT.

278
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,810
WHY?

279
00:11:18,834 --> 00:11:20,435
I WAS GIVEN A... THESE
KIDS TOOK A BOOK

280
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,975
AND THEY WERE GOING TO
THROW IT AT ME, RIGHT?

281
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:25,226
AND THE TEACHER CAUGHT HIM
WITH THE BOOK IN HIS HAND,

282
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,685
AND HE TOOK IT OFF THE
OTHER KID'S BOOK.

283
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:28,975
AND THE OTHER KID
STOOD UP AND SAID,

284
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:30,310
"GIVE ME MY DAMN BOOK BACK."

285
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:32,560
SO MRS. GANIN SAYS,
"YOU TWO GET OUT.

286
00:11:32,584 --> 00:11:34,310
"YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT
LANGUAGE AROUND HERE,

287
00:11:34,334 --> 00:11:36,018
AND NO USE TO GET UP FOR IT."

288
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,810
DO YOU KNOW THEY BROUGHT ME
INTO THE DETENTION ROOM?

289
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:40,435
THEY BROUGHT ME INTO MR.
WALSH'S ROOM,

290
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,393
AND THEY GOT ME DRAGGED
IN FOR NOTHING.

291
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,518
AND I TRIED TO EXPLAIN
IT TO HIM, AND HE SAID,

292
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:46,727
"WILL YOU TAKE THE DETENTION?"

293
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:48,143
WHICH WAS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS.

294
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,894
SEE, WE'RE OUT TO ESTABLISH
SOMETHING, AREN'T WE?

295
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,310
YES.

296
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:52,975
WE'RE OUT TO ESTABLISH
THAT YOU CAN BE A MAN

297
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,477
AND YOU CAN TAKE ORDERS.

298
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:56,477
WE WANT TO PROVE TO THEM THAT
YOU CAN TAKE THE ORDERS.

299
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:59,852
BUT, MR. ALLEN, SEE, IT'S
ALL AGAINST MY PRINCIPLES.

300
00:11:59,876 --> 00:12:01,975
YOU HAVE TO STAND FOR SOMETHING.

301
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:03,143
YES, BUT I THINK YOUR PRINCIPLES

302
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,810
AREN'T INVOLVED HERE.

303
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:07,685
I THINK IT'S A QUESTION NOW

304
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:10,393
OF PROVING YOURSELF TO BE A MAN.

305
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:12,768
IT'S A QUESTION HERE OF HOW,

306
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:14,976
HOW DO WE FOLLOW RULES
AND REGULATIONS?

307
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,935
IF THERE'S A MISTAKE MADE,
THERE'S AN APPROACH TO IT.

308
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,351
I THINK YOU DON'T
FIGHT WITH A TEACHER.

309
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,975
I THINK YOU ASK
PERMISSION TO TALK.

310
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:21,685
AND ASK THEM TO LISTEN TO YOU.

311
00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:23,518
NOW, THIS ISN'T
WHAT YOU DIDN'T DO.

312
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,975
NOW, IF YOU HAD TAKEN
YOUR DETENTION...

313
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:28,975
AND, AFTER ALL, THEY DIDN'T
REQUIRE MUCH FROM YOU.

314
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:31,894
THE TEACHER FELT YOU
WERE OUT OF ORDER,

315
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,685
AND IN HER JUDGMENT, YOU
DESERVED A DETENTION.

316
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:36,143
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG

317
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:37,518
WITH ASSIGNING YOU A DETENTION.

318
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:38,975
AND I THINK YOU SHOULD
PROVE YOURSELF.

319
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,393
YOU SHOULD SHOW
THAT YOU CAN TAKE

320
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:41,975
THE DETENTION WHEN GIVEN IT.

321
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:43,894
I SHOULD PROVE THAT I AM A MAN

322
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:45,975
AND THAT'S WHAT I INTEND TO
DO BY DOING WHAT I FEEL,

323
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,975
IN MY OPINION, IS WHAT I,
IS DOING WHAT IS RIGHT.

324
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,975
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE YOUR
DETENTION OR AREN'T YOU?

325
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:55,975
I FEEL THAT YOU SHOULD.

326
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:57,975
I'LL TAKE IT, BUT UNDER PROTEST.

327
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,975
ALL RIGHT, THEN, YOU
TAKE IT UNDER PROTEST.

328
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:00,975
THAT'S GOOD.

329
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:02,935
YES, I'D LIKE YOU
TO TAKE IT TODAY.

330
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,018
WILL TODAY AFTER SCHOOL BE OKAY?

331
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,643
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ROOM, ROOM 120?

332
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:06,894
118.

333
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:07,999
ALL RIGHT.

334
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:11,975
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

335
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,975
GOING TO THE LUNCHROOM.

336
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:15,685
WELL, GO TO THE LUNCHROOM.

337
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:18,268
GOODBYE.

338
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:24,768
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

339
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:25,975
YOU GOT A PASS?

340
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:27,393
YEAH.

341
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:29,999
YOU GOT A PASS? DO
YOU HAVE A PASS?

342
00:13:36,834 --> 00:13:38,975
HOW ABOUT YOU?

343
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:40,852
HANG UP.

344
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:43,268
LET'S GO.

345
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:46,999
IT'S FOR EMERGENCIES,
LET'S GET ON THE BALL.

346
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,351
I TOLD YOU TO GET OFF OF THERE.

347
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,768
LET'S GO!

348
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:00,975
EXCUSE ME, MR. MURRAY,

349
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:04,518
YOU SEE, I'M AT SCHOOL AND
A MAN'S YELLING AT ME.

350
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:05,975
YOU GET A PASS.

351
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:08,101
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. BYE.

352
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,852
I HAD TO CALL MY
INSURANCE COMPANY.

353
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:10,975
WELL, YOU GET A PASS.

354
00:14:10,999 --> 00:14:12,975
BUT I HAVE LUNCH
NOW, I HAVE LUNCH.

355
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:14,975
I WAS COMING FROM MY LUNCH.

356
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:16,351
LUNCH MEANS LUNCH.

357
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:18,226
IT DOESN'T MEAN
MAKE PHONE CALLS.

358
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,310
ALL RIGHT.

359
00:14:20,334 --> 00:14:22,727
YOU GOT A PASS?

360
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:23,959
OKAY.

361
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:35,018
â™ª AND IT'S SO MUCH FUN â™ª

362
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:38,268
â™ª AND IT'S NOT SO

391
00:15:56,918 --> 00:15:58,975
â™ª SEE IT'S NOT SO HARD TO DO â™ª

392
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,643
â™ª BAH BAH BAH BAH â™ª

394
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:05,894
â™ª AND I HOPE THE

395
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:07,101
â™ª CLAP YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR â™ª

396
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,685
â™ª SIMPLE SIMON SAYS â™ª

397
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:09,976
â™ª DO IT DOUBLE TIME â™ª

398
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,768
â™ª SIMPLE SIMON SAYS â™ª

399
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:15,602
AND WHEN THE DUST HAD LIFTED,
THE MEN SAW WHAT HAD OCCURRED,

400
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:19,393
THERE WAS JIMMY SAFE AT SECOND
AND FLYNN A-HUGGING THIRD.

401
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:23,351
AND FROM 5,000 THROATS AND MORE
THERE ROSE THERE A LUSTY YELL,

402
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,351
IT RUMBLED THROUGH THE VALLEY,
IT RATTLED IN THE DELL.

403
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,975
IT POUNDED ON THE MOUNTAIN
AND RECOILED UPON THE FLAT,

404
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:32,477
FOR CASEY, MIGHTY CASEY,
WAS ADVANCING TO THE BAT.

405
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:34,268
THERE WAS EASE IN CASEY'S MANNER

406
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:36,351
AS HE STEPPED INTO HIS PLACE.

407
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,975
THERE WAS PRIDE

408
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:41,393
IN CASEY'S BEARING AND A
SMILE ON CASEY'S FACE.

409
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,185
AND WHEN, RESPONDING
TO THE CHEERS,

410
00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:45,018
HE LIGHTLY DOFFED HIS HAT,

411
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,894
NO STRANGER IN THE
CROWD COULD DOUBT

412
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:48,852
'TWAS CASEY AT THE BAT.

413
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,435
10,000 EYES WERE ON HIM

414
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,602
AS HE RUBBED HIS
HANDS WITH DIRT.

415
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:54,143
5,000 TONGUES APPLAUDED

416
00:16:54,167 --> 00:16:56,310
WHEN HE WIPED THEM ON HIS SHIRT.

417
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:59,435
THEN WHILE THE WRITHING PITCHER
GROUND THE BALL INTO HIS HIP,

418
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,768
DEFIANCE FLASHED IN CASEY'S EYE,

419
00:17:01,792 --> 00:17:04,560
A SNEER CURLED CASEY'S LIP.

420
00:17:04,584 --> 00:17:05,974
AND NOW THE
LEATHER-COVERED SPHERE

421
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:07,727
CAME HURTLING THROUGH THE AIR,

422
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:10,268
AND CASEY STOOD A-WATCHING IT
IN HAUGHTY GRANDEUR THERE.

423
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,974
CLOSE BY THE STURDY BATSMAN
THE BALL UNHEEDED SPED...

424
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:15,974
"THAT AIN'T MY
STYLE," SAID CASEY.

425
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:18,974
"STRIKE ONE," THE UMPIRE SAID.

426
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:21,268
FROM THE BENCHES
BLACK WITH PEOPLE,

427
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,974
THERE WENT UP A MUFFLED ROAR,

428
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:25,310
LIKE THE BEATING
OF THE STORM WAVES

429
00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:26,976
ON A STERN AND DISTANT SHORE.

430
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,643
"KILL HIM! KILL THE UMPIRE!"
SHOUTED SOMEONE ON THE STAND.

431
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,768
AND IT'S LIKELY THEY'D
HAVE KILLED HIM

432
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:35,018
HAD NOT CASEY RAISED HIS HAND.

433
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:36,727
WITH A SMILE OF
CHRISTIAN CHARITY,

434
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:38,935
GREAT CASEY'S VISAGE SHONE,

435
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:42,935
HE STILLED THE RISING TUMULT,
HE BADE THE GAME GO ON.

436
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,976
HE SIGNALED TO THE
PITCHER, AND ONCE MORE

437
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,351
THE DUN SPHERE FLEW, BUT
CASEY STILL IGNORED IT,

438
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:51,226
AND THE UMPIRE SAID,
"STRIKE TWO."

439
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,393
"FRAUD!" CRIED THE
MADDENED THOUSANDS,

440
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,018
AN ECHO ANSWERED, "FRAUD."

441
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:59,975
BUT ONE SCORNFUL LOOK FROM CASEY

442
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:02,975
AND THE AUDIENCE WAS AWED.

443
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,059
THEY SAW HIS FACE
GROW STERN AND COLD,

444
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,435
THEY SAW HIS MUSCLES STRAIN,

445
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:10,435
AND THEY KNEW THAT CASEY

446
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:12,727
WOULDN'T LET THAT
BALL GO BY AGAIN.

447
00:18:12,751 --> 00:18:14,975
THE SNEER HAS FLED
FROM CASEY'S LIP,

448
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:17,018
HIS TEETH ARE CLENCHED IN HATE,

449
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:20,894
HE POUNDS WITH CRUEL VIOLENCE
HIS BAT UPON THE PLATE.

450
00:18:20,918 --> 00:18:22,560
AND NOW THE PITCHER
HOLDS THE BALL,

451
00:18:22,584 --> 00:18:25,518
AND NOW HE LET'S IT GO,

452
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:27,935
AND NOW THE AIR IS SHATTERED
BY THE FORCE OF CASEY'S BLOW.

453
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:30,101
OH, SOMEWHERE IN
THIS LAND OF OURS

454
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,435
THE SUN IS SHINING BRIGHT,

455
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:35,976
THE BAND IS PLAYING SOMEWHERE,
AND SOMEWHERE HEARTS ARE LIGHT,

456
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,976
AND SOMEWHERE MEN ARE LAUGHING,
AND LITTLE CHILDREN SHOUT,

457
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,976
BUT THERE IS NO JOY
IN MUDVILLE...

458
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,209
GREAT CASEY HAS STRUCK OUT.

459
00:18:58,834 --> 00:19:02,477
Teacher: WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH THE BAKING SODA?

460
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:04,226
DID YOU USE TOO MUCH?

461
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,417
YOU'VE GOT TO TASTE
THE SODA, RIGHT?

462
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:11,268
AN EVEN MORE EFFICIENT WAY
TO USE THAT KNIFE IS THIS.

463
00:19:11,292 --> 00:19:12,975
SEE HERE?

464
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:15,999
IF YOU PIVOT IT FROM HERE,
YOU MAY CUT YOURSELF.

465
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:28,018
ONE PART GRANULATED SUGAR
AND ONE PART BROWN SUGAR.

466
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,602
RIGHT?

467
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,894
NOW YOU NEED ANOTHER
MEASURING CUP.

468
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:32,894
YOU'LL FIND ONE IN THE
CLOSET, RIGHT HERE.

469
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,018
Boy: YES, MA'AM.

470
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,852
RIGHT.

471
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:38,435
AND, GARY, WHAT ABOUT
THIS BROWN SUGAR?

472
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:40,310
HOW IS HE GOING TO MEASURE IT?

473
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:41,727
Boy: PACKED.

474
00:19:41,751 --> 00:19:43,709
PACKED. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, OKAY.

475
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:48,894
WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER, DOLL?

476
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,268
Girl: 11. 11?

477
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:53,226
[ APPLAUSE ] GREAT! SHE SURE
IS, AND ISN'T SHE A BEAUTY?

478
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,310
JUST LOOK AT THAT, SHE
IS A VISION FOR SURE.

479
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,643
LET'S HAVE NUMBER 14.

480
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,518
UM, YOU MAY DISAPPEAR.

481
00:20:01,542 --> 00:20:03,685
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, GIRLS.

482
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:05,435
WAIT A MINUTE.

483
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:07,435
I THINK THIS IS A
GOOD TIME... HOLD IT.

484
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:09,435
IT'S A GOOD TIME TO
TALK ABOUT CLOTHES.

485
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:12,852
A GIRL CAME INTO MY CLASS
TODAY IN A CULOTTE COSTUME.

486
00:20:12,876 --> 00:20:15,810
AND IT LOOKED JUST
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, AH,

487
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:17,975
IT LOOKS AS SPORTY AS THIS.

488
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,727
IF IT WERE ON SOMEONE
WITH SLIMMER LEGS,

489
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,518
I THINK IT MIGHT LOOK GOOD.

490
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,310
COULD YOU FIND SOMEONE
TO MODEL IT FRIDAY

491
00:20:23,334 --> 00:20:24,975
WITH REAL THIN LEGS, HONEY?

492
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:26,975
AND, GIRLS, DON'T WEAR
CULOTTES TO SCHOOL

493
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:29,059
BECAUSE YOU'LL LOOK
JUST LIKE THAT.

494
00:20:29,083 --> 00:20:31,059
YOUR LEGS ARE ALL TOO
HEAVY FOR THE STUFF.

495
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,059
DON'T WEAR IT TOO SHORT
THEY LOOK MISERABLE.

496
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:35,518
I LOVE YOU. GOODBYE.

497
00:20:35,542 --> 00:20:37,643
OKAY, NEXT... LET'S SEE.

498
00:20:37,667 --> 00:20:41,226
NOW, I THINK IF THIS YOUNG LADY,
SHE'S GOT A LEG PROBLEM, TOO.

499
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,226
IF SHE DID SOMETHING
ABOUT THOSE STOCKINGS,

500
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,602
SHE MIGHT WELL LOOK BETTER.

501
00:20:44,626 --> 00:20:46,602
COULD YOU GET A MATCHING PINK

502
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:48,935
OR FLESH-COLORED
STOCKING FOR FRIDAY?

503
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,602
YEAH, SOMETHING THAT FITS IN.

504
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,477
SALMON-COLORED, PINK, OR WHITE.

505
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,143
OR WHITE, ALL RIGHT?

506
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,975
WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN ON FRIDAY.

507
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:58,310
WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER, HONEY?

508
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:00,894
NUMBER 14 AND YOU WILL
TAKE CARE OF THAT.

509
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:02,975
WE AREN'T EVEN ASKING YOU
ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I THINK

510
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:04,976
SHE'S GOT A PRETTY NICE
COLOR HERE, LOOKS GOOD.

00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:13,975
OF REALLY PUTTING SOME STYLE
INTO THIS PARTICULAR GARMENT.

SHE'S DONE A NICE JOB.

SHE'S DONE EVERYTHING
SHE CAN TO CUT IT DOWN.

520
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,975
I MEAN, SHE DESIGNED THIS
GARMENT HERSELF WITH THE IDEA

521
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,975
OF MAKING IT GRACIOUS
AND GRACEFUL,

522
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:30,975

DO WITH FASHION AND DESIGN.

THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

680
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:11,226
BUT RIGHT NOW, FOR FORMAL
WEAR, IT IS NOT STYLE.

681
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,685
IT'S STYLE FOR A VERY SMALL
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE.

682
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:18,975
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IN THIS
SCHOOL WHAT THE MAJORITY WANTS.

683
00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:23,975
UNTIL THIS KIND OF RULE CHANGES,
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO.

684
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:26,059
THE MAJORITY WANTS
A FORMAL AFFAIR,

685
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:29,059
WHICH MEANS A LONG GOWN OR
A COCKTAIL-LENGTH GOWN.

686
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:30,643
Boy: THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS?

687
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:32,059
THAT'S RIGHT.

688
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:34,059
Girl: EXCUSE ME, WHAT'S
THE COCKTAIL LENGTH?

689
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:35,435
Counselor: KNEE LENGTH.

00:29:35,459 --> 00:29:36,975
Girl: HERE?

691

NOT ABOVE THE KNEE.

692

Girl: THIS IS MY KNEE.

693
00:29:40,334 --> 00:29:41,975
Woman: NO, IT ISN'T.

694
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:43,975
IF YOU FELL ON THAT
PART OF YOUR ANATOMY,

695
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:45,975
YOU WOULD NOT INJURE
YOUR UPPER THIGH.

696
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:47,768
Counselor: WOULDN'T
TEAR THE DRESS, ANYWAY.

[ WOMAN LAUGHS ]

698
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:53,894
Counselor: NO, I THINK THAT IT'S
NICE TO BE INDIVIDUALISTIC,

699
00:29:53,918 --> 00:29:57,477
BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES
TO BE INDIVIDUALISTIC.

00:29:57,501 --> 00:29:59,477
Girl: I DIDN'T MEAN TO
BE INDIVIDUALISTIC.

NOT CRITICIZING,

I SAY IT'S NICE TO BE THAT WAY,

703

BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN
TIMES TO BE THAT WAY.

704
00:30:04,834 --> 00:30:07,768
UH, I THINK YOU CAN BE
INDIVIDUALISTIC IN YOUR DRESS,

705
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:11,435

706

Girl: I HAPPEN TO
ENJOY A SHORT GOWN.

707
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:16,310
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULDN'T
BE ACCEPTED TO THE PROM.

708
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:18,602
I DIDN'T DO IT PURPOSELY
THIS IS WHAT I ENJOY.

709
00:30:18,626 --> 00:30:20,226
Counselor: WHAT
DOES FORMAL MEAN?

710
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,976
Girl: WELL, FORMAL MEANS DRESSY.
I DIDN'T THINK OF IT AS A GOWN.

711
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,560
Counselor: OH.

712
00:30:24,584 --> 00:30:26,560
Woman: FORMAL MEANS
MORE THAN DRESSY.

713
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,727

GET AN INVITATION

714
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:29,894
TO A FORMAL AFFAIR,

715
00:30:29,918 --> 00:30:31,852
IT SAYS "WHITE TIE
OR BLACK TIE."

716
00:30:31,876 --> 00:30:33,975
IT DOESN'T SAY THAT THE
GIRLS OR WOMEN WEAR

717
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,685
ANY LENGTH THEY WANT.

718
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,393
IT MEANS A FLOOR-LENGTH GOWN.

719
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:39,975
YOU GET AN INVITATION
TO A COCKTAIL PARTY,

720
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:41,975
IT DOESN'T MEAN A
FLOOR-LENGTH GOWN,

721
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:44,852
IT MEANS A KNEE-LENGTH
GOWN OR A FLOOR-LENGTH.

722
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,975
BUT "FORMAL" MEANS A LONG
GOWN FOR A YOUNG LADY,

723
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:50,685
A MIDDLE-AGED LADY,
ELDERLY LADY.

724
00:30:50,709 --> 00:30:53,560
SEE WHAT I MEAN, AND FOR
A MAN IT MEANS A TUX,

725
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:55,560
AND IT'S DETERMINED
BY THE TIME OF DAY

726
00:30:55,584 --> 00:30:57,518
WHETHER IT'S WHITE
TIE OR BLACK TIE.

727
00:30:57,542 --> 00:30:58,975
THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS.

728
00:30:58,999 --> 00:31:00,810
I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OTHER,
REALLY, WHOLE STORY.

729
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:02,518
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY
WEREN'T PERMITTED.

730
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:03,976
THIS IS WHAT I
FELT LIKE WEARING.

731
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,477
Counselor: IT DOESN'T MATTER

732
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:07,059
IF IT'S NOT PERMITTED,
IT'S A MATTER

733
00:31:07,083 --> 00:31:08,894
OF WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS.

734
00:31:08,918 --> 00:31:10,393
THIS IS OFFENSIVE
TO THE WHOLE CLASS.

735
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:11,975
Girl: I DIDN'T REALLY
MEAN IT TO BE.

736

Counselor: I KNOW YOU PROBABLY
DIDN'T MEAN IT TO BE THIS,

737
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,393
BUT THIS IS WHAT IT IS.

738
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:16,975
Woman: WE BOUGHT AN ATMOSPHERE

739
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:18,975
BY RENTING THE SHERATON
BALLROOM, WHICH IS VERY FORMAL.

740
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:20,852
Counselor: WE COULD HAVE
HAD THE DANCE IN THE GYM.

741
00:31:20,876 --> 00:31:22,768
Woman: WE COULD HAVE
HAD THAT IN THE GYM

742
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:24,685
AND THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

743

Counselor: MAYBE A COUPLE OF
GO-GO GIRLS UP ON THE STAGE

WITH A $50 ORCHESTRA,

745

AND WE WOULD HAVE
HAD A NICE DANCE,

746

THIS IS THE SENIOR PROM.

748

THIS IS FORMAL.

749
00:31:36,292 --> 00:31:39,477
IT'S THE ONE TIME IN YOUR LIFE

750
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:41,894
THAT YOUR CLASS
LOOKS SO DIFFERENT

751
00:31:41,918 --> 00:31:42,894
YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE ANYBODY.

752
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:44,560
IT'S THE FIRST CHANCE YOU HAVE

753
00:31:44,584 --> 00:31:46,560
TO BE YOUNG LADIES
AND YOUNG GENTLEMEN.

754
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:49,894
Woman: I HAD A BOY ASK, AND I
HAD A GIRL COME UP AND SAY,

755
00:31:49,918 --> 00:31:52,975
"CAN MY BOYFRIEND WEAR
A DARK SUIT BECAUSE

756
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:55,643
HE CANNOT AFFORD THE MONEY
FOR THE RENTAL OF A TUX?"

757
00:31:55,667 --> 00:31:57,268
I SAID, "NO, HE CAN'T."

758
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,975
BECAUSE THEN MY HUSBAND
HAS A RIGHT TO WEAR

759
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:00,975
THE BEAUTIFUL SUIT
HE JUST BOUGHT...

760
00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:03,560
BUT WE HAVE TO PAY, WHAT IS
IT, $10 OR $15 TO RENT A TUX.

761
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,975
NOW, MY HUSBAND HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE SCHOOL,

762
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:10,143
BUT HE'S HONORING THE YOUNGSTERS
BY COMING DRESSED PROPERLY.

763
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:12,602
Counselor: AND I WOULDN'T THINK
OF COMING WITHOUT WEARING A TUX.

764
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:14,018
I RENT ONE EVERY YEAR.

765

Woman: I HAVE TO WEAR A
LONG GOWN, I'D LOVE TO...

766

CAR COMFORTABLY.

AND IF YOU DOUBT THAT
HE'S A POET NOW,

WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR
SOME OF HIS POETRY.

BOARD I HAVE SOME THINGS

AND WE'LL BE FINDING HOW
HE SAYS WHAT HE DOES SAY.

786
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,435
WHAT DO THEY WANT TO SAY
ABOUT OUR LIVES AND HOW?

787
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:32,435
AND I THINK THE BEST WAY
TO START IS BY LOOKING

788
00:33:32,459 --> 00:33:35,975
AT ONE OF THE BEST OF THE POEMS,
"THE DANGLING CONVERSATION."

ONE ON YOUR SHEET.

FIRST, WE'LL READ THE POEM,

791
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,976
THEN LISTEN TO IT, THEN
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT

792

AND SEE HOW ALL THE
VARIOUS POETIC DEVICES

793

REINFORCE THE THEME, AND SEE
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

794

AND THEN WE'LL LISTEN
TO IT ONCE AGAIN,

795
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:58,975

A LITTLE BIT MORE TO YOU.

00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:40,185
â™ª AND YOU READ YOUR
EMILY DICKINSON â™ª

845
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:45,435
â™ª AND I MY ROBERT FROST â™ª

846
00:36:45,459 --> 00:36:48,727
â™ª AND WE NOTE OUR PLACE
WITH BOOKMARKERS â™ª

847
00:36:48,751 --> 00:36:51,975
â™ª THAT MEASURE WHAT WE'VE LOST â™ª

848
00:36:51,999 --> 00:36:58,976
â™ª LIKE A POEM POORLY WRITTEN â™ª

849
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,852
â™ª WE ARE VERSES OUT OF RHYTHM â™ª

850
00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:04,768
â™ª COUPLETS OUT OF RHYME â™ª

851
00:37:04,792 --> 00:37:08,226
â™ª IN SYNCOPATED TIME â™ª

852
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,143
â™ª AND THE DANGLING
CONVERSATION â™ª

853
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:16,226
â™ª AND THE SUPERFICIAL SIGHS â™ª

854
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,709
â™ª ARE THE BORDERS OF OUR LIVES â™ª

855
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:26,810
â™ª YES, WE SPEAK OF
THINGS THAT MATTER â™ª

856
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:31,975
â™ª WITH WORDS THAT MUST BE SAID â™ª

857
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,351
â™ª CAN ANALYSIS BE WORTHWHILE? â™ª

858
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:38,810
â™ª IS THE THEATER REALLY DEAD? â™ª

859
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:42,393
â™ª AND HOW THE ROOM IS
SOFTLY FADED... â™ªâ™ª

860
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:44,727
HEY, YOU! TURN AROUND, PAL.

861
00:37:44,751 --> 00:37:46,143
SIR.

862
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,059
DON'T "SIR" ME.

863
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,560
DON'T FEED ME THAT
"SIR" BUSINESS.

864
00:37:50,584 --> 00:37:52,560
YOU PUNCHED THIS
GUY IN THE MOUTH.

865
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:54,185
ON WHAT BASIS?

866
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:56,975
SIR, SIR, HE STARTED MOUTHING
OFF, STARTED LAUGHING, SO...

867
00:37:56,999 --> 00:38:00,643
Dean: YEAH, THAT DOESN'T
GIVE YOU A RIGHT TO HIT HIM.

868
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:04,310
IF IT WAS A 6' 2",
215-POUND FULLBACK,

869
00:38:04,334 --> 00:38:08,101
YOU WOULDN'T BE SO QUICK
TO PUNCH HIM IN THE MOUTH.

870
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:10,768
P-E-R-G.

871
00:38:10,792 --> 00:38:12,518
Boy: O-L-I-N-O.

872
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,667
WHERE DO YOU COME
IN TO HIT THIS GUY?

873
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:20,268
HE HAS A RIGHT TO
ERASE THE BOARD.

874
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:22,435
Boy: THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT WAS OVER.

875
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:25,310
Dean: JUST AS MUCH AS YOU
HAVE A RIGHT TO WRITE ON IT.

876
00:38:25,334 --> 00:38:26,975
YOU DIDN'T ASK PERMISSION

877
00:38:26,999 --> 00:38:28,560
TO WRITE THOSE NAMES
ON THE BOARD, DID YOU?

878
00:38:28,584 --> 00:38:30,602
PARDON ME, SIR, BUT THAT
WASN'T WHAT IT WAS OVER.

879
00:38:30,626 --> 00:38:32,518
WHAT WAS IT OVER?

880
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,518
SIR, JUST BEFORE CLASS STARTED,

881
00:38:34,542 --> 00:38:36,852
WE HAD AN ARGUMENT, AND
I DIDN'T DO NOTHING.

882
00:38:36,876 --> 00:38:39,768
WELL, YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSEDTO DO ANYTHING.

883
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:41,975
YOU DON'T STRIKE OR HIT ANYBODY.

884
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:43,894
LEVINE WEARS GLASSES
ON TOP OF IT,

885
00:38:43,918 --> 00:38:45,560
YET YOU STILL HIT HIM.

886
00:38:45,584 --> 00:38:47,226
SIR, I WEAR GLASSES, TOO.

887
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,226
Dean: THAT'S WHY YOU ARE
GOING TO BE SUSPENDED,

888
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,268
FOR THROWING THE FIRST
PUNCH... YES, SIR.

889
00:38:51,292 --> 00:38:53,268
DON'T GIVE ME THAT
"YES, SIR" BUSINESS.

890
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:55,727
I DON'T LIKE THE "SIR" BUSINESS.
YOU KNOW WHY?

891
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:58,727
BECAUSE THERE'S NO
SINCERENESS BEHIND IT.

892
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:02,059
Female dean: AND HOW ABOUT
THE POOR, POOR TEACHER,

893
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,975
WHOEVER IT WAS?

894
00:39:03,999 --> 00:39:05,975
I DON'T KNOW.

895
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:08,894
Girl: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
SHE SAID THAT WE DID, BUT...

896
00:39:08,918 --> 00:39:10,393
Dean: IT'S A MATTER OF

897
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:12,393
BEING INHUMAN TO
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

898
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,477
THAT'S WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO.

899
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:17,518
Girl: BUT ALL I KNOW
IS THAT SHE GOT SUE

900
00:39:17,542 --> 00:39:18,894
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE AND...

901
00:39:18,918 --> 00:39:20,975
Dean: SUE WHO?

902
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:22,685
Girl: THE OTHER GIRL.

903
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:24,975
AND SUE DIDN'T... I DON'T
THINK SUE HAD ANY...

904
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:28,477
SHE TOLD... SHE SAID THAT WE
LOCKED HER IN THE CLOSET.

905
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:31,185
Dean: YOU MEAN SUE AND YOU?

906
00:39:31,209 --> 00:39:34,059
Girl: I MEAN THE CLASS.

907
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:36,393
NOBODY LOCKED HER IN THE
CLOSET AS FAR AS I KNOW.

908
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,602
LOOK, IF SHE WOULD'VE BEEN
LOCKED IN THE CLOSET,

909
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:42,435
I SURE WOULD HAVE HEARD THAT
AND TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED.

910
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:45,059
Dean: SHE MAY HAVE HAD A
LITTLE MORE CONTROL THAN THAT.

911
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:47,477
THAT MUCH NOISE, IT'S A
LITTLE EMBARRASSING TO HER.

912
00:39:47,501 --> 00:39:49,518
SHE WASN'T GOING TO CALL
EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION TO IT.

913
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:50,975
Girl: IT WASN'T FAIR.

914
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:54,976
SUE WAS JUST MESSING AROUND,
JUST AS MUCH AS US.

915
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,393
THE REST OF THE CLASS...

916
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:59,018
AND NOW SUE'S IN
SO MUCH TROUBLE,

917
00:39:59,042 --> 00:40:00,975
JUST BECAUSE OF
THAT ONE TEACHER.

918
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:03,518
AND BECAUSE SUE GOT IN TROUBLE,
I BLAME IT A LOT ON THE TEACHER

919
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:05,226
'CAUSE...

920
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:08,602
Dean: WELL, LET'S KEEP LOOKING
AT THAT BECAUSE, AGAIN,

921
00:40:08,626 --> 00:40:11,226
THIS IS MY CONCERN, EILEEN.

922
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:13,975
SUE GOT IN TROUBLE
BECAUSE OF THE TEACHER.

923
00:40:13,999 --> 00:40:15,852
SUE DID NOTHING TO HELP?

924
00:40:15,876 --> 00:40:17,393
WHOEVER SUE IS, I DON'T KNOW.

925
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,393
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
WHEN I ASKED YOU HER NAME

926
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,518
BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO TALK.

927
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:23,059
Eileen: SHE JUST MESSED
AROUND LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

928
00:40:23,083 --> 00:40:25,518
Woman: LOOK, CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT "MESSING AROUND" MEANS?

929
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:27,810
THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIND OUT FOR MONTHS.

930
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:29,852
EVERY TIME YOU WOULD
SAY "MESSING AROUND."

931
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:32,975
WHAT DOES IT
ACTUALLY CONSIST OF?

932
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:36,477
Eileen: I DON'T KNOW, WE
WERE TALKING, LAUGHING...

933
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:42,101
WELL, JUST PLAIN TALKING AND
LAUGHING ISN'T OFFENSIVE.

934
00:40:42,125 --> 00:40:45,975
Eileen: WELL, WE WERE
CATCHING A BOOK OR SOMETHING.

935
00:40:45,999 --> 00:40:47,975
OH, YOU THREW A BOOK AROUND?

936
00:40:47,999 --> 00:40:49,852
Eileen: NOT JUST ME!

937
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:52,143
BUT WHOEVER WAS INVOLVED.

938
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:53,975
Eileen: I KNOW I DID A LOT.

939
00:40:53,999 --> 00:40:56,643
LIKE, I DID A LOT. I
TALKED BACK A LOT.

940
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:58,768
DID YOU TALK BACK
TO THE TEACHER?

941
00:40:58,792 --> 00:40:59,959
Eileen: YEAH.

942
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,268
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU
CALL "MESSING AROUND"?

943
00:41:04,292 --> 00:41:06,101
Eileen: NO, WELL...

944
00:41:06,125 --> 00:41:08,393
ISN'T THAT MORE DISRESPECT?

945
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:11,852
Eileen: WHAT I DID WAS
DISRESPECT, BUT WHAT THE REST...

946
00:41:11,876 --> 00:41:16,975
WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE DID
WAS MESSING AROUND.

947
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:18,477
I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW.

948
00:41:18,501 --> 00:41:20,351
Dean: YOU SEE, WHAT
MOTHER IS SAYING...

949
00:41:20,375 --> 00:41:22,351
AT LEAST WHAT I'M SAYING, I
THINK WHAT MOTHER IS SAYING...

950
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:23,975
IS THAT WE HOPE, EILEEN,

951
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:25,685
THAT YOU DON'T SET
YOUR STANDARDS BY

952
00:41:25,709 --> 00:41:27,310
THE SO-CALLED "EVERYBODY ELSE,"

953
00:41:27,334 --> 00:41:28,935
THAT YOU SET YOUR STANDARDS

954
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:33,768
ON WHAT YOU KNOW IS
THE THING TO DO.

955
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:36,935
I REPEAT, THERE'S NO DOUBT

956
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:39,727
THE TEACHER WAS NOT
HOLDING THE CLASS,

957
00:41:39,751 --> 00:41:42,685
WAS NOT DOING THE JOB YOU
THINK SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE,

958
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,351
FROM WHAT YOU SAY,
I'LL ACCEPT THAT.

959
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:48,477
BUT WHO BREAKS THE CIRCLE

960
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:50,685
WHEN THINGS GO AROUND
AND AROUND AND AROUND?

961
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,685
SOMEONE HAS TO BE MATURE ENOUGH

962
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:54,975
TO MOVE OUT OF THE CIRCLE AND
INTO THE STRAIGHT, RIGHT?

963
00:41:54,999 --> 00:41:58,976
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO
BREAK AWAY FROM IT.

964
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,435
YOU'RE INTELLIGENT,
YOU'RE MATURE,

965
00:42:02,459 --> 00:42:03,975
YOU HAVE THE BACKGROUND.

966
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:05,999
YOU CAN BE THE ONE
THAT CAN DO IT.

967
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:13,643
WHY DON'T YOU OFFER THE POSITIVE
KIND OF LEADERSHIP THAT YOU CAN,

968
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,643
THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AND
THAT I KNOW YOU HAVE,

969
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,518
THAT MOTHER KNOWS YOU HAVE?

970
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:20,768
YOU CAN BE A REAL FORCE
IN ANY GROUP, EILEEN.

971
00:42:20,792 --> 00:42:22,685
CAN'T YOU?

972
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,975
THE KIDS RALLY AROUND YOU A BIT.

973
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:27,727
Eileen: WELL, NOT REALLY.

974
00:42:27,751 --> 00:42:30,518
I'VE SEEN YOU IN THE LUNCHROOM.

975
00:42:30,542 --> 00:42:32,518
WE'VE GOT US A POTENTIAL LEADER.

976
00:42:32,542 --> 00:42:33,975
Mother: EILEEN CAN.

977
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:35,602
Dean: IT SHOWS WHEREVER SHE IS.

978
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:37,435
I'VE SEEN HER ONCE IN
A WHILE IN A GROUP.

979
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:39,894
YOU CAN SEE WHO THE LEADER IS
IN A GROUP, AND SHE HAS IT.

980
00:42:39,918 --> 00:42:42,975
EILEEN HAS A VERY SET MIND,

981
00:42:42,999 --> 00:42:45,685
AND IF SHE DECIDES THAT
SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE,

982
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:47,975
THIS IS WHAT SHE PURSUES,
THIS I KNOW ABOUT HER.

983
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,101
Dean: I THINK THAT'S GOOD.

984
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,393
I THINK IT'S EXCELLENT
IN MANY WAYS,

985
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:52,975
BUT I'VE OFTEN SAID TO HER,

986
00:42:52,999 --> 00:42:55,727
"EILEEN, USE YOUR
DETERMINATION FOR RIGHT.

987
00:42:55,751 --> 00:42:58,602
AND AS LONG AS YOU DO,
YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT."

988
00:42:58,626 --> 00:43:01,975
AND ONE THING, THIS IS THE ONE
THING THAT BOTHERS ME SO MUCH...

989
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:04,685
THE MAIN THING IN OUR
HOME HAS ALWAYS BEEN

990
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:06,727
RESPECT FOR AN ADULT.

991
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:09,310
I WAS BROUGHT UP THAT
WAY... MY HUSBAND WAS.

992
00:43:09,334 --> 00:43:12,185
AND WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TEACH
OUR CHILDREN THE SAME THING.

993
00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:14,975
TO ME, I THINK, ONE
OF THE WORST OFFENSES

994
00:43:14,999 --> 00:43:18,518
IS BEING DISRESPECTFUL
TO AN OLDER PERSON.

995
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:20,976
IRREGARDLESS OF WHAT
THE CONDITION MAY BE.

996
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,935
YOU CAN SAY THE SAME THING
IN A PLEASANT MANNER

997
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:26,560
THAT YOU CAN IN
AN OFFENSIVE WAY.

998
00:43:26,584 --> 00:43:28,143
AND THIS IS ONE THING

999
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:30,393
THAT'S DISTURBED ME
RECENTLY ABOUT EILEEN.

1000
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:32,310
THAT EVEN AT HOME, NOW SHE...

1001
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:35,143
I DON'T SAY THE LANGUAGE
THAT SHE USES IS WRONG,

1002
00:43:35,167 --> 00:43:38,101
BUT IT'S THE MANNER
THAT THE SAME...

1003
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:40,059
THAT A SENTENCE
IS BROUGHT FORTH.

1004
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,975
AND I TOLD HER,
"EVENTUALLY, EILEEN,

1005
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:45,185
THIS IS GOING TO
HURT YOU OUTSIDE."

1006
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:47,976
AND FINALLY IT HAS.

1007
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,059
AND I THINK YOU WOULD KIND
OF HAVE TO DECIDE, ARLEEN,

1008
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:54,727
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT WHERE YOU
STOOD IN YOUR COLLEGE CLASS,

1009
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,685
WHETHER YOU WOULD RATHER
BE IN AN EASIER SCHOOL,

1010
00:43:56,709 --> 00:43:58,602
AND TOWARD THE TOP OF THE CLASS,

1011
00:43:58,626 --> 00:44:00,351
OR IN A HARDER SCHOOL

1012
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:03,393
AND TOWARD THE
BOTTOM OF THE CLASS.

1013
00:44:03,417 --> 00:44:04,975
I THINK I WOULD GAIN
MORE BY BEING, LIKE,

1014
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:07,477
IN THE MIDDLE OR THE TOP THAN
BEING AT THE VERY BOTTOM,

1015
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:11,018
NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP
UP WITH EVERYBODY ELSE.

1016
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:13,560
Counselor: DO YOU WANT A
COLLEGE COURSE, THEN, DEAR,

1017
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,477
WHERE, AT THE END OF FOUR
YEARS, YOU WOULD BE FINISHED

1018
00:44:16,501 --> 00:44:19,560
WITH YOUR EDUCATION AND ABLE
TO GO OUT AND MAKE A LIVING,

1019
00:44:19,584 --> 00:44:22,643
OR DO YOU WANT THE KIND OF
COURSE WHERE, AT THE END

1020
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:24,477
OF FOUR YEARS, IT IS
LIKELY THAT YOU WOULD BE

1021
00:44:24,501 --> 00:44:26,894
GOING ON WITH YOUR EDUCATION?

1022
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:28,768
Arleen: I'M NOT SURE RIGHT NOW.

1023
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:30,975
I THINK I WANT TO GO TO
FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE

1024
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:32,852
AND, MAYBE, IF I
BECOME A TEACHER,

1025
00:44:32,876 --> 00:44:34,894
STOP, AND THEN I CAN
ALWAYS TAKE COURSES AGAIN,

1026
00:44:34,918 --> 00:44:39,560
GO HIGHER, GET A HIGHER DEGREE.

1027
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:43,143
OR, I THINK, UH, A SOCIAL WORKER

1028
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:44,727
OR PSYCHOLOGIST HAS
TO GO FIVE YEARS.

1029
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:46,727
Counselor: OR SIX
YEARS OR SEVEN YEARS.

1030
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:49,435
IT WOULD DEPEND ON WHAT
YOU CHOSE AFTER THAT.

1031
00:44:49,459 --> 00:44:51,435
I DON'T THINK I WANT
TO GO MORE THAN

1032
00:44:51,459 --> 00:44:54,975
MAYBE FIVE OR SIX YEARS,
OR MORE THAN FIVE.

1033
00:44:54,999 --> 00:44:57,602
WELL, I THINK YOU'VE GIVEN ME

1034
00:44:57,626 --> 00:45:00,435
A PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE IDEA
OF WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.

1035
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:02,685
AND THEN I WOULD HAVE
TO ASK YOU, SIR,

1036
00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:04,976
THE HARD, HARD
QUESTION OF HOW MUCH

1037
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,602
COULD YOU CONTRIBUTE TO
YOUR DAUGHTER'S EDUCATION?

1038
00:45:07,626 --> 00:45:10,310
Father: WELL, UH,
THAT'S A HARD QUESTION

1039
00:45:10,334 --> 00:45:13,018
TO SAY BECAUSE, UH, IF SHE
LIVES AWAY FROM HOME,

1040
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:14,768
THEN IT'S A DIFFERENT
STORY ALTOGETHER.

1041
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:18,101
AND IF SHE IS AT HOME,
IT'S ANOTHER STORY.

1042
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:21,935
BUT THE WAY SHE'S TALKING, SHE
DOESN'T WANT TO STAY HOME.

1043
00:45:21,959 --> 00:45:25,975
SO I WOULD SAY ABOUT $1,000,
$1,500 IS ABOUT THE BEST

1044
00:45:25,999 --> 00:45:28,975
I COULD GIVE HER A YEAR
TO GO AWAY TO COLLEGE.

1045
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:30,768
MM-HMM.

1046
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:32,226
THEN IT WOULD SEEM
TO ME THAT, ARLEEN,

1047
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,018
THAT THE MOST REALISTIC
WAY TO PLAN IT WOULD BE

1048
00:45:35,042 --> 00:45:37,975
TO THINK ABOUT
WHERE YOU COULD GO

1049
00:45:37,999 --> 00:45:43,518
IF YOUR FATHER COULD GIVE
YOU $1,000 TO $1,500,

1050
00:45:43,542 --> 00:45:47,602
AND THEN TO TRY FOR SCHOLARSHIP
IN SOME OTHER PLACES

1051
00:45:47,626 --> 00:45:49,143
THAT MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT
MORE EXPENSIVE.

1052
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:51,477
BUT, I THINK YOU
KIND OF HAVE TO PLAN

1053
00:45:51,501 --> 00:45:53,226
FOR WHERE YOU WOULD GO

1054
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,351
IF YOU DIDN'T GET ANY
FINANCIAL AID FROM SOMEONE.

1055
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:58,975
I MEAN, YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO...
YOU LOOK AT THE BRIGHTER SIDE

1056
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:00,351
ABOUT WHERE YOU
WOULD LIKE TO GO,

1057
00:46:00,375 --> 00:46:01,975
YOU CAN HAVE ALL
YOUR DREAM SCHOOLS,

1058
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:03,435
BUT AT THE BOTTOM,

1059
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:05,685
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE SOME
COLLEGE OF LAST RESORT

1060
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:08,975
WHERE YOU COULD BE SURE
THAT YOU WOULD GO,

1061
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:12,935
IF NONE OF YOUR
DREAMS CAME TRUE.

1062
00:46:12,959 --> 00:46:16,975
RHONA IS THE RECIPIENT OF A
$10,000 HERO SCHOLARSHIP

1063
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:20,852
TO ANY COLLEGE ANYWHERE IN
THE COUNTRY SHE WANTS TO GO.

1064
00:46:20,876 --> 00:46:22,975
Father: I'M NOT SAYING
SHE IS COLLEGE MATERIAL,

1065
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:25,894
BUT AT LEAST SHE CAN HAVE SOME
TYPE OF EDUCATION, FOLLOWING...

1066
00:46:25,918 --> 00:46:27,518
SHE CAN GO TO ANY COLLEGE

1067
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:28,810
AND DO WHATEVER SHE WANTED.

1068
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:31,101
TELL ME AGAIN,

1069
00:46:31,125 --> 00:46:33,143
DO YOU THINK YOU WANT
TO GO TO COLLEGE?

1070
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:35,435
YES.

1071
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,143
Father: PLEASE, NOW,
YOU'RE LYING TO THE MAN...

1072
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:38,894
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE.

1073
00:46:38,918 --> 00:46:40,560
WELL, I DO, BUT NOT
THE KIND OF COLLEGE

1074
00:46:40,584 --> 00:46:41,976
THAT YOU WANT ME TO.

1075
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,727
WHAT KIND OF COLLEGE
DO YOU WANT TO GO TO?

1076
00:46:43,751 --> 00:46:45,143
I WANT TO BE A COSMETICIAN.

1077
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:47,518
COSMETICIAN? BUT THAT'S
NOT A COLLEGE, IS IT?

1078
00:46:47,542 --> 00:46:48,975
WELL, IT'S A BEAUTY
CULTURE SCHOOL.

1079
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:51,602
IT'S A BEAUTY CULTURE
SCHOOL, IT'S NOT A COLLEGE.

1080
00:46:51,626 --> 00:46:53,560
THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT ARE
DIFFERENT THAN FOR COLLEGE.

1081
00:46:53,584 --> 00:46:54,976
YES.

1082
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,018
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
FOREIGN LANGUAGE. NO.

1083
00:46:57,042 --> 00:46:58,602
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ALGEBRA,

1084
00:46:58,626 --> 00:46:59,975
YOU DON'T HAVE GEOMETRY.

1085
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:01,975
SO THAT ACTUALLY, AS FAR
AS GOING TO COLLEGE,

1086
00:47:01,999 --> 00:47:04,310
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
PREPARED FOR A COLLEGE.

1087
00:47:04,334 --> 00:47:06,518
DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU ARE
DISAPPOINTING YOUR PARENTS

1088
00:47:06,542 --> 00:47:07,975
BY NOT GOING TO COLLEGE?

1089
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:09,101
NOW, TELL ME THE TRUTH.

1090
00:47:09,125 --> 00:47:10,518
YES.

1091
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:11,727
YOU FEEL YOUR PARENTS
ARE DISAPPOINTED?

1092
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:12,226
MY FATHER.

1093
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,351
YOUR FATHER IS?

1094
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:16,975
TELL ME, WOULD YOU FEEL BETTER
IF YOU KNEW YOUR FATHER

1095
00:47:16,999 --> 00:47:19,935
REALLY ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT
YOU DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE?

1096
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:22,810
YOU FEEL A BIT GUILTY FOR
NOT GOING TO COLLEGE?

1097
00:47:22,834 --> 00:47:24,727
YES, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1098
00:47:24,751 --> 00:47:25,935
WELL...

1099
00:47:25,959 --> 00:47:27,727
THAT YOU ARE DISAPPOINTING
YOUR PARENTS?

1100
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:29,768
I'M DISAPPOINTING MY FATHER,

1101
00:47:29,792 --> 00:47:31,975
BUT I DON'T THINK I'D FEEL
GUILTY ABOUT NOT GOING.

1102
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:33,435
YOU DON'T FEEL GUILTY AT ALL?

1103
00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:35,351
NOT GUILTY... IT'S MY LIFE.

1104
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:36,935
IT'S YOUR LIFE.

1105
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,602
I FEEL THAT WHAT I WANT TO BE

1106
00:47:38,626 --> 00:47:40,975
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN
WHAT HE DESIRES ME TO BE.

1107
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:42,727
I SEE...

1108
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:44,727
BUT YOU KNOW YOUR PARENTS
ARE DISAPPOINTED,

1109
00:47:44,751 --> 00:47:46,810
YOUR FATHER IN PARTICULAR? YES.

1110
00:47:46,834 --> 00:47:48,185
YOU CAN'T UNDO THE PAST.

1111
00:47:48,209 --> 00:47:51,602
EVEN IF SOMEBODY
HAS MADE A MISTAKE

1112
00:47:51,626 --> 00:47:56,018
AND BEEN WRONG AND UNFAIR,
YOU CAN'T UNDO THE PAST.

1113
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:57,976
THE ONLY THING YOU CAN
DO IS TRY TO DO BETTER

1114
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,101
IN THE PRESENT SO THAT THE
FUTURE WILL BE BETTER.

1115
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:04,393
SO WHAT I'M SUGGESTING TO
YOU, WORK AS HARD AS YOU CAN,

1116
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:05,976
DO THE BEST YOU CAN,

1117
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,976
AND CONFER WITH MR.
SCHUSTER ABOUT, ABOUT THIS,

1118
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,935
AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS AT
THE END OF THE SEMESTER, OKAY?

1119
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:16,975
YOU GO BACK TO CLASS
NOW, OR ARE YOU THROUGH?

1120
00:48:16,999 --> 00:48:18,018
NO, I'M THROUGH.

1121
00:48:18,042 --> 00:48:19,477
Father: THANKS AGAIN, DR.
BOODISH.

1122
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:20,975
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1123
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:22,310
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1124
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:23,643
YOU'RE WELCOME. GOODBYE.

1125
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,101
OH, INCIDENTALLY, HOW ABOUT GYM?

1126
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:27,059
THIS IS THE STRONGEST
CHILD IN THE SCHOOL.

1127
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:29,185
Boodish: WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO TO PASS GYM?

1128
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:30,975
WELL, I HAVE TO DO MY MAKE-UPS.

1129
00:48:30,999 --> 00:48:34,768
Boodish: THAT'S NECESSARY
FOR GRADUATION, YOU KNOW.

1130
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:36,185
IT IS?

1131
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:40,975
IT IS... SHE HAS TO PASS.

1132
00:48:40,999 --> 00:48:42,602
I WISH, DR. BOODISH,

1133
00:48:42,626 --> 00:48:45,975
SHE WAS AS SMART
AS SHE IS STRONG.

1134
00:48:45,999 --> 00:48:47,310
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

1135
00:48:47,334 --> 00:48:48,975
VERY STRONG GIRL.

1136
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:51,727
Boodish: I'M GOING TO ASK
YOUR DAUGHTER A QUESTION.

1137
00:48:51,751 --> 00:48:53,727
HOW DID YOU FEEL
ABOUT THAT REMARK

1138
00:48:53,751 --> 00:48:55,435
THAT YOUR FATHER JUST MADE?

1139
00:48:55,459 --> 00:48:57,143
I LIKED IT.

1140
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,292
YOU LIKED IT? GOOD, OKAY.

1141
00:49:02,999 --> 00:49:04,975
Man on Intercom: THERE IS A CAR
IN THE STUDENTS' DRIVEWAY

1142
00:49:04,999 --> 00:49:09,834
BLOCKING THE EXIT
OF TWO OTHER CARS.

1143
00:49:11,292 --> 00:49:12,976
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN GIVING...

1144
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,727
GIVE THEM JOBS.

1145
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:18,059
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN GIVING,

1146
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,268
LET THEM EARN IT.

1147
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,059
THERE'S TOO MUCH RELIEF
GOING ON, THAT'S ALL.

1148
00:49:23,083 --> 00:49:24,435
WE ARE TOO MUCH TO A POINT

1149
00:49:24,459 --> 00:49:25,975
WHERE THEY ARE
GIVING ALL THE TIME.

1150
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:29,268
YOU'RE ALL HUNG UP ON
THE PROTESTANT ETHIC.

1151
00:49:29,292 --> 00:49:32,685
THERE ARE SO MANY
FACETS TO THIS.

1152
00:49:32,709 --> 00:49:34,143
I DON'T BELIEVE IN
WHAT BILL SAYS.

1153
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:35,975
I DON'T BELIEVE 100%

1154
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,975
IN WHAT BILL SAYS ABOUT
GIVING THINGS AWAY.

1155
00:49:37,999 --> 00:49:40,477
I NEVER THINK THAT ANYBODY
APPRECIATES ANYTHING.

1156
00:49:40,501 --> 00:49:41,975
LOOK AT YOUR OWN CHILDREN...

1157
00:49:41,999 --> 00:49:44,268
WHEN YOU GIVE THEM, DO
THEY REALLY APPRECIATE IT?

1158
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:46,268
SOMETIMES IF THEY WORK FOR
IT A LITTLE BIT, BILL,

1159
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:48,185
THEY APPRECIATE
THESE THINGS MORE.

1160
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:50,310
Man: LOOK AT THIS MONEY

1161
00:49:50,334 --> 00:49:51,975
WE ARE GIVING AWAY TO
THE WORLD, FOREIGN AID.

1162
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:53,477
THEY'RE LAUGHING AT US.

1163
00:49:53,501 --> 00:49:55,518
THEY'RE CRAMMING IT
RIGHT DOWN YOUR THROAT.

1164
00:49:55,542 --> 00:50:00,185
ACTUALLY, THIS FOREIGN
AID BUSINESS...

1165
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:02,894
WE'RE REALLY GIVING
MONEY TO THE GUYS

1166
00:50:02,918 --> 00:50:04,768
WHO ARE BUYING FROM
THE RICH PEOPLE

1167
00:50:04,792 --> 00:50:05,976
AND FROM THE
MANUFACTURERS OVER HERE.

1168
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,518
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY'S GOING.

1169
00:50:07,542 --> 00:50:10,101
IT'S NOT JUST BEING
GIVEN TO THEM.

1170
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:13,268
BUT THE THING IS, THERE IS
SO MUCH MONEY BEING WASTED.

1171
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:15,351
Girl: W.H. SILVERS.

1172
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:17,975
Teacher: YES, W.H. SILVERS.

1173
00:50:17,999 --> 00:50:22,018
NOW, WHAT WAS HE TRYING TO
DO, WHAT WAS HIS PURPOSE?

1174
00:50:22,042 --> 00:50:23,975
YES, AIDELE?

1175
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:26,560
Aidele: HE WAS
TRYING TO ESTABLISH

1176
00:50:26,584 --> 00:50:30,101
AN EIGHT-HOUR WORKING
DAY FOR LABORERS...

1177
00:50:30,125 --> 00:50:32,185
Teacher: YEAH, WELL, HE
WANTED HIGHER WAGES...

1178
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:33,894
HE WANTED AN EIGHT-HOUR WORKDAY.

1179
00:50:33,918 --> 00:50:35,560
BUT HE TRIED TO UNITE...

1180
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:38,143
THIS IS THE IMPORTANT
THING ABOUT THIS...

1181
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:43,101
HE TRIED TO UNITE ALL LABOR
UNIONS OF THE COUNTRY

1182
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:45,643
INTO A FEDERATION MEMBERSHIP.

1183
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:49,310
WHAT ON THE HORIZON,
OR WHAT EXISTED

1184
00:50:49,334 --> 00:50:51,975
THAT FORCED LABOR TO TURN
TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING?

1185
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:54,018
WHAT WAS THERE A LACK OF?

1186
00:50:54,042 --> 00:50:55,852
Girl: COMMUNICATIONS.

1187
00:50:55,876 --> 00:50:59,975
Teacher: YES, COMMUNICATIONS,
LACK OF SECURITY,

1188
00:50:59,999 --> 00:51:01,351
CONCERN FOR THE JOB.

1189
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:03,894
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THIS...

1190
00:51:03,918 --> 00:51:05,477
LET'S GET TO THE BEGINNINGS.

1191
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:08,643
FIRST OF ALL, THERE WAS
THE LACK OF SECURITY.

1192
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:11,976
SECOND OF ALL, THERE WAS A
LACK OF COMMUNICATION...

1193
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,975
THE ATTITUDE OF THE EMPLOYEES,
OR OF THE EMPLOYERS

1194
00:51:15,999 --> 00:51:17,976
TOWARDS THE EMPLOYEES,

1195
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,435
WITH REGARD TO
WORKING CONDITIONS,

1196
00:51:19,459 --> 00:51:20,975
WITH REGARD TO
LIVING CONDITIONS,

1197
00:51:20,999 --> 00:51:22,477
WITH REGARD TO WAGES...

1198
00:51:22,501 --> 00:51:25,226
VERY LITTLE COMMUNICATION.

1199
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,975
Teacher: ALL RIGHT,
WE HAVE EVIDENTLY

1200
00:51:26,999 --> 00:51:29,852
A GREAT IMBALANCE IN
AMERICAN SOCIETY.

1201
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:33,226
WE HAVE, ON THE ONE HAND, WE
HAVE AN AFFLUENT SOCIETY...

1202
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,477
AND THAT'S ONE AMERICA...
AND ON THE OTHER HAND,

1203
00:51:35,501 --> 00:51:37,727
WE HAVE ANOTHER AMERICA
AND, BY THE WAY,

1204
00:51:37,751 --> 00:51:39,975
THAT'S THE NAME OF A GOOD
BOOK BY MICHAEL HARRINGTON

1205
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:41,975
CALLED "THE OTHER AMERICA."

1206
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:43,268
AND WHAT IS THIS OTHER AMERICA?

1207
00:51:43,292 --> 00:51:45,143
ANOTHER AMERICA THAT IS NOT...

1208
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:48,477
AMERICA OF POVERTY, AMERICA
THAT IS NOT SHARING

1209
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:51,143
IN THE AFFLUENCE OF
AMERICAN SOCIETY.

1210
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:56,685
AND KING WAS THERE TO TRY TO
UPLIFT THIS OTHER AMERICA.

1211
00:51:56,709 --> 00:52:00,059
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE
DEPARTMENT OF LABOR

1212
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:05,101
SAYS SHOULD BE THE COMFORT
LEVEL OF A FAMILY OF FOUR...

1213
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,894
A MAN, A WIFE, AND TWO CHILDREN?

1214
00:52:06,918 --> 00:52:09,310
WHAT THEY SHOULD EARN
TO BE COMFORTABLE.

1215
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:12,226
NOT... MODERATELY
COMFORTABLE, NOT AFFLUENT,

1216
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:14,894
BUT JUST MODERATELY
COMFORTABLE IN OUR SOCIETY.

1217
00:52:14,918 --> 00:52:17,310
KNOW WHAT THE FIGURE IS, ANY
IDEA WHAT THE FIGURE IS?

1218
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,185
CHRISTINE? HOW MUCH?

1219
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:20,268
Christine: $9,000.

1220
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:22,351
YES, A LITTLE OVER $9,000.

1221
00:52:22,375 --> 00:52:23,894
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE...

1222
00:52:23,918 --> 00:52:25,268
DO YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENT
OF THE AMERICAN POPULATION

1223
00:52:25,292 --> 00:52:27,393
EARNS OVER $9,000?

1224
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:29,310
IT'S NOT THE MAJORITY.

1225
00:52:29,334 --> 00:52:32,975
LET'S DETERMINE SOME OF THE
ATTITUDES IN THIS CLASS

1226
00:52:32,999 --> 00:52:36,727
AND SEE HOW WE COME OUT.

1227
00:52:36,751 --> 00:52:38,351
ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY OF YOU
WOULD BE A MEMBER OF A CLUB

1228
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:40,810
WHERE MINORITY MEMBERS
OF THE CLUB WERE NEGRO?

1229
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:42,477
HOW MANY WOULD ACCEPT
THAT SITUATION?

1230
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:44,976
YOU WOULD BE A
MEMBER OF THE CLUB

1231
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,976
IF A MINORITY OF THE
MEMBERS WERE NEGRO?

1232
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,560
ALL RIGHT.

1233
00:52:48,584 --> 00:52:49,852
OKAY, FINE, PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN.

1234
00:52:49,876 --> 00:52:52,852
HOW MANY WOULD NOT BE
A MEMBER OF THE CLUB?

1235
00:52:52,876 --> 00:52:54,310
ALL RIGHT, HOW MANY WOULD
BE A MEMBER OF A CLUB

1236
00:52:54,334 --> 00:52:56,185
WHERE HALF THE MEMBERS

1237
00:52:56,209 --> 00:53:01,999
WERE NEGRO MEMBERS AND THE
OTHER HALF WERE WHITE?

1238
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:04,976
ALL RIGHT... PUT
YOUR HANDS DOWN.

1239
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,685
HOW MANY WOULD NOT BE A
MEMBER OF THAT CLUB?

1240
00:53:08,709 --> 00:53:09,976
ALL RIGHT.

1241
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,101
REMEMBER, THERE'S NO
RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER...

1242
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:14,810
IT'S JUST, I'M JUST TRYING TO
DETERMINE WHAT ATTITUDES ARE.

IS SUCH A CLOISTERED,

SECLUDED PLACE.

1269
00:53:48,999 --> 00:53:51,602
IT IS.

1270
00:53:51,626 --> 00:53:53,018
THE POLICY OF NORTHEAST

1271
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:55,018
IS TO AVOID CONTROVERSY
COMPLETELY.

1272
00:53:55,042 --> 00:53:57,310
Woman: MISERABLE ATTITUDE.

1273
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,310
THERE ARE GOOD POINTS, MARK.

1274
00:53:59,334 --> 00:54:01,310
CAN'T YOU FIND ANYTHING
GOOD ABOUT THIS SCHOOL?

1275
00:54:01,334 --> 00:54:03,185
[ STUDENTS ALL TALKING AT ONCE ]

1276
00:54:03,209 --> 00:54:04,975
IT'S GOT LOTS OF ROOM,

1277
00:54:04,999 --> 00:54:06,975
EXCEPT NOT FOR AS MANY
KIDS AS ARE IN IT.

1278
00:54:06,999 --> 00:54:09,268
IT'S VERY NICE, WELL-VENTILATED.

1279
00:54:09,292 --> 00:54:11,226
[ STUDENTS LAUGHING ]

1280
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,810
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THE PEOPLE

1281
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,185
WHO GO TO IT, THOUGH, REALLY.

1282
00:54:15,209 --> 00:54:17,018
WITH VERY FEW EXCEPTIONS.

1283
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:19,810
AND MOST OF THE PEOPLE I COULD
MAKE THOSE EXCEPTIONS ABOUT

1284
00:54:19,834 --> 00:54:21,310
ARE RIGHT IN THIS ROOM,

1285
00:54:21,334 --> 00:54:23,268
WITH MAYBE FIVE OR
SIX EXCEPTIONS.

1286
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:26,059
AND THE REST OF THE SCHOOL
STINKS, IN MY ESTIMATION.

1287
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:29,975
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT QUALIFIED
TO MAKE, YOU KNOW,

1288
00:54:29,999 --> 00:54:31,975
GIGANTIC JUDGMENTS
ABOUT THE SCHOOL,

1289
00:54:31,999 --> 00:54:33,685
BUT I THINK IN ITS
ATTITUDE TOWARDS EDUCATION

1290
00:54:33,709 --> 00:54:37,351
AND ITS RELATIONS
WITH THE WORLD TODAY,

1291
00:54:37,375 --> 00:54:39,975
THIS SCHOOL IS MISERABLE.

1292
00:54:39,999 --> 00:54:41,185
IT'S CLOISTERED, IT'S SECLUDED,

1293
00:54:41,209 --> 00:54:43,018
IT'S COMPLETELY SHELTERED

1294
00:54:43,042 --> 00:54:44,975
FROM EVERYTHING THAT'S
GOING ON IN THE WORLD.

1295
00:54:44,999 --> 00:54:46,976
AND I THINK IT'S WRONG,
IT HAS TO BE CHANGED,

1296
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,393
AND I THINK THAT'S
OUR PURPOSE HERE.

1297
00:54:48,417 --> 00:54:51,894
AND NOT TO TALK ABOUT FILMS.

1298
00:54:51,918 --> 00:54:53,975
Woman: A LOT OF YOU
ARE SO NEGATIVE

1299
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,018
THAT I CAN SEE SOMEDAY SOMEBODY
COMING OUT AND SAYING,

1300
00:54:57,042 --> 00:54:59,477
"YOU KNOW, YOU KIDS
JUST DON'T BELONG.

1301
00:54:59,501 --> 00:55:01,101
"YOU SPOIL NORTHEAST,

1302
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:03,560
NORTHEAST HIGH WOULD
BE A NICE..."

1303
00:55:03,584 --> 00:55:04,975
Mark: THAT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENED.

1304
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:06,810
MR. SIMON PULLED ME TO
HIS OFFICE AND SAID,

1305
00:55:06,834 --> 00:55:09,435
"YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
A NORTHEASTER, SON.

1306
00:55:09,459 --> 00:55:11,768
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
A NORTHEASTER."

1307
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:17,351
Man: I THINK ONE THING THAT
HAS TO BE CHANGED AROUND

1308
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:19,975
IS THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE THESE,

1309
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:23,975
SEE, LIKE, YOU HAVE THESE
VARIABLES EXISTING

1310
00:55:23,999 --> 00:55:26,975
WITHIN THE SCHOOL
SYSTEM IN NORTHEAST.

1311
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:29,975
AND THE THING ABOUT IT
THAT MAKES IT SO ALIEN,

1312
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:32,351
OR, FEEL TOWARDS US,

1313
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:35,143
IS THE FACT THAT, UM,

1314
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:38,975
YOU HAVE TO LIKE,
CONFORM TO THESE IDEAS

1315
00:55:38,999 --> 00:55:42,975
WHICH PEOPLE LIKE MR.
SIMON, DR. ALLEN...

1316
00:55:42,999 --> 00:55:45,226
Woman: WHY DO YOU PICK ON HIM...
ALL RIGHT, HE'S GOT PROBLEMS.

1317
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:49,975
BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO
SAY THAT THE SCHOOL...

1318
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:51,975
I LIKE TO THINK THAT
HE IS IN A POSITION

1319
00:55:51,999 --> 00:55:54,268
WHERE MAYBE YOU'LL FIND SOME
OTHERS OF THE SAME OPINION.

1320
00:55:54,292 --> 00:55:57,101
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS, HE
HAS A JOB AS VICE PRINCIPAL

1321
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:58,602
THAT IS IN CONTACT
WITH THE STUDENTS.

1322
00:55:58,626 --> 00:56:00,643
HE HANDLES THE
STUDENT ACTIVITIES.

1323
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:02,310
NOW, I'M NOT SAYING THAT MR.
SIMON IS THE ONLY ONE

1324
00:56:02,334 --> 00:56:04,894
THAT SAYS THESE THINGS.

1325
00:56:04,918 --> 00:56:07,727
THE RULE IS FAIRLY, I
THINK YOU'LL AGREE,

1326
00:56:07,751 --> 00:56:11,018
CONSISTENT AMONG MANY
MEMBERS OF THE FACULTY.

1327
00:56:11,042 --> 00:56:13,602
AND DON'T JUST PINPOINT POOR MR.
SIMON.

1328
00:56:13,626 --> 00:56:15,018
HE MAY BE RIGHT,
HE MAY BE WRONG,

1329
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:16,975
BUT HE'S THE ONE VOICING
IT ALL THE TIME,

1330
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:19,477
BUT HE'S VOICING IT AS A
QUITE COMMON FEELING.

1331
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,975
WELL, I'LL SAY SOMETHING
GOOD ABOUT THE SCHOOL.

1332
00:56:20,999 --> 00:56:24,975
I'LL SAY THAT SCIENTIFICALLY
AND TECHNOLOGICALLY,

1333
00:56:24,999 --> 00:56:27,602
NORTHEAST IS AN ADVANCED SCHOOL,

1334
00:56:27,626 --> 00:56:29,643
APART FROM OTHER HIGH
SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY.

1335
00:56:29,667 --> 00:56:32,351
A COMPLIMENT, I'M
GOING TO FAINT.

1336
00:56:32,375 --> 00:56:34,768
APART FROM OTHER HIGH
SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY,

1337
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:37,810
POSSIBLY IN THE WORLD ALSO.

1338
00:56:37,834 --> 00:56:42,059
THIS SCHOOL, IN THAT
PARTICULAR FIELD,

1339
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:43,975
IS THE LEADER.

1340
00:56:43,999 --> 00:56:48,226
AS MARK HAS SAID...
MORALLY, SOCIALLY,

1341
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,602
THIS SCHOOL IS A GARBAGE
