1
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:27,910
<i>I felt like I'd been
under there my entire life.</i>

2
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:31,746
<i>Wrapped in yellow blankets,
like a baby.</i>

3
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:34,660
<i>Swaddled too tight.</i>

4
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:38,107
<i>I was sinking further...</i>

5
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:39,522
<i>and further.</i>

6
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:42,990
<i>And just when I was about
to run out of breath,</i>

7
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,037
<i>something pulled me out.</i>

8
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:50,802
<i>Something in the trees.</i>

9
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,629
<i>A light.</i>

10
00:00:56,313 --> 00:00:57,919
<i>A glow.</i>

11
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:04,015
Is someone hungry?

12
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:05,843
Huh?

13
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,856
Hello?

14
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:11,217
Tilly.

15
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,467
Hey.

16
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:17,498
Hello.

17
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,006
Come here.

18
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,096
Hello.

19
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,198
What's your name?

20
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:29,299
Tilly.

21
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:30,831
Tilly.

22
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,276
Where are you off to?

23
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:12,407
Hey.

24
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:19,064
It's okay.

25
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:25,112
Your dog's really cute.

26
00:06:25,157 --> 00:06:27,018
Don't take her.

27
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:33,415
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

28
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:35,629
Um.

29
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:38,790
Are you okay?

30
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:43,069
How did you know I was here?

31
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:45,058
Well...

32
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:47,019
I was there...

33
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,910
last night at the reservoir.

34
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,605
I saw what happened.

35
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:04,501
I won't tell anyone.

36
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:07,210
I pinky promise.

37
00:07:08,827 --> 00:07:11,866
What are you doing
with your finger?

38
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,218
Haven't you heard
of a pinky promise?

39
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,476
Well, it means more than
a normal handshake.

40
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,531
So...

41
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,156
what's your name?

42
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:52,586
Claudia.

43
00:07:55,828 --> 00:07:57,789
I'm Grace.

44
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,433
What color are the other fingers?

45
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,066
- What?
- If, if this one is pink,

46
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,019
what color are the others?

47
00:08:17,112 --> 00:08:19,621
Well, it's not that it's pink.
It's just...

48
00:08:19,691 --> 00:08:22,160
just called your pinky finger.

49
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:25,057
And the other ones
all have different names.

50
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,136
You know them, right?

51
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:29,910
- First, second, third-
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

52
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,574
Pinky.

53
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:34,050
Ring.

54
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:36,613
Rude.

55
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,675
What makes it rude?

56
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:40,550
- No.
- What?

57
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,613
Just, don't do that.

58
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:47,159
It's like saying something
really mean,

59
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,647
but with your finger.

60
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:57,803
Do you wanna come
and sit with me?

61
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:24,091
Can I come visit you sometime?

62
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:25,951
No one can know I'm here.

63
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,927
If they find out,
they'll take me away.

64
00:09:27,982 --> 00:09:29,795
I won't tell anyone.

65
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:32,599
It can be our secret.

66
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,216
Purple promise?

67
00:09:42,488 --> 00:09:44,169
Purple promise.

68
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,555
<i>It was her.</i>

69
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:54,594
<i>Grace.</i>

70
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,735
<i>The glow on the bank.</i>

71
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:01,454
<i>The pull from the trees.</i>

72
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:06,386
<i>She's not of this place.</i>

73
00:10:29,403 --> 00:10:32,202
You want me to have a nervous
breakdown, Grace, is that it?

74
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:33,543
No, Mom.

75
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:35,924
Why the fuck are the cops here?

76
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:37,354
I don't know.

77
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,239
What the hell you been up to,
young lady?

78
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:42,407
- I've not done a fucking thing.
- Hey, hey, listen. Listen, hey.

79
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:43,843
Don't talk to her like that.

80
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:46,604
We just need to ask her
a few more questions.

81
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,098
Okay, so...

82
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:58,778
I'm Detective Croydon.

83
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,403
This is my partner,
Detective Jones.

84
00:11:01,707 --> 00:11:05,387
We just wanted to clarify...

85
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:07,590
what you saw
at the res last night.

86
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:09,918
- Mm.
- So, you...

87
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:12,942
you saw some thrashing
in the water...

88
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:15,496
and then you said you saw a girl
running away from the res.

89
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:18,043
And we are not sure who that is.

90
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:19,434
See...

91
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:22,215
the deceased didn't have
any kids or family.

92
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:24,395
So, we think that it...

93
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:27,694
might have been a visitor,
or someone from out of town.

94
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:29,782
Now, is there anything
you can tell us about-

95
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,379
Look.

96
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:33,989
So, we really need you to think,

97
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:36,559
- okay?
- It's a scorpion in a lollipop.

98
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:38,776
What'd she look like?

99
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:40,528
Light hair? Dark hair?

100
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:43,317
Yeah, look,
I don't really think I saw a girl.

101
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:45,029
No girl?

102
00:11:45,106 --> 00:11:46,387
No.

103
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,653
It was dark.

104
00:11:47,684 --> 00:11:49,783
And I was on my own
and I think I got freaked.

105
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:52,762
And saw things
that weren't actually there.

106
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:55,343
I've got a really
overactive imagination.

107
00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:56,621
Mom says it all the time.

108
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:57,676
So, wait.

109
00:11:57,715 --> 00:11:59,403
Let me get this straight.

110
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:01,043
There was no girl

111
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:02,840
- But, you did say-
- Yeah, I know.

112
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:04,215
I know.

113
00:12:04,403 --> 00:12:06,278
I'm saying that I think
I got carried away...

114
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,871
when I was speaking
to the officer last night.

115
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:10,918
There was no girl.

116
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:13,645
But, I definitely saw a woman,

117
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,918
an older lady,
walking into the water...

118
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,309
and then...

119
00:12:18,372 --> 00:12:19,999
the thrashing.

120
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:22,117
Right. So...

121
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:25,007
you saw an older woman
walking into the water

122
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:26,070
Yeah.

123
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:29,203
That author lady
who lives by the res.

124
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:32,163
I recognised her from the back
of one of her books.

125
00:12:32,271 --> 00:12:34,328
- Veronica Fox.
- Mm.

126
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:36,226
Yeah, that's her.

127
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,812
She just walked
into the water and...

128
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,781
didn't come out.

129
00:12:42,222 --> 00:12:44,035
It was fucked.

130
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:49,942
Well...

131
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:52,270
sounds about right.

132
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:54,762
Cool.

133
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:56,978
So, I'm, I'm good?

134
00:12:57,078 --> 00:12:58,801
I'm not in trouble?

135
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:00,062
No.

136
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,359
You're not in trouble.

137
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,476
Like I said, we just wanted
to clarify a few things.

138
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:04,812
- It's cool.
- You've been a big help.

139
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:06,250
Thank you, Grace.

140
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,506
Hey.

141
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:13,279
What you saw
must be really scary.

142
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:16,795
You got someone to talk to
about it if you need to?

143
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:19,240
Yeah.

144
00:14:16,191 --> 00:14:18,318
Listen, my darling.

145
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,617
My darling girl, what's wrong?

146
00:14:55,948 --> 00:14:57,875
I don't know.

147
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:01,359
Oh, my sweet.

148
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:04,281
You're having bad thoughts again?

149
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,625
Oh, my darling.

150
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,180
It's okay.

151
00:15:09,797 --> 00:15:12,575
It's okay, my darling,
it's okay.

152
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,477
Shh, shh, shh.

153
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:19,046
Sweetheart.

154
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:23,132
Breathing in...

155
00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:24,570
and out.

156
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:26,975
Sweet love,
you're doing so well.

157
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:29,100
Just breathe in.

158
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:32,092
Stay with me, my darling.
It's all okay.

159
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:34,116
Shh, shh, shh.

160
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,335
Sweet love, it's okay.

161
00:15:36,931 --> 00:15:38,960
It's okay.
Just stay with me.

162
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,382
Stay with me.

163
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:42,210
Shh, shh, shh.

164
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:43,928
My darling, it's okay.

165
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:46,114
Slow it down.
Shh, shh, shh.

166
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,702
It's okay.

167
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,910
We're nearly there, my darling.

168
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:53,405
We are nearly there.

169
00:15:54,155 --> 00:15:55,741
Breathe in...

170
00:15:58,318 --> 00:15:59,803
and out.

171
00:16:00,701 --> 00:16:02,413
Breathe in...

172
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:05,186
and out.

173
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,194
Good.
Breathe in...

174
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:10,850
and out.

175
00:16:11,342 --> 00:16:12,663
- Where-
- What?

176
00:16:12,701 --> 00:16:14,696
Where did my mom go?

177
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:17,264
What did I do to her?

178
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:18,888
Uh, nothing.
Hey, Claudia, it's me.

179
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:19,944
It's me, Grace.

180
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:21,319
Hey, remember?

181
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,366
No, no, no, please.

182
00:16:22,397 --> 00:16:23,823
Claudia, please.
Come back.

183
00:16:23,848 --> 00:16:25,069
Wait.

184
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:31,513
Claudia.

185
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:33,592
Claudia!

186
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:35,927
Claudia!

187
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:38,443
Claudia!

188
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:51,380
Claudia!

189
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,927
Claudia!

190
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:57,834
Claudia!

191
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:11,854
Hey.

192
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:15,908
Claudia.

193
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:18,713
I should be with her.

194
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,533
I should be...

195
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:25,190
with her.

196
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:34,671
You can't be seen here.

197
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:40,216
You don't want
to be found, do you?

198
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:44,857
Hey, let's go home.

199
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:47,638
Yeah?

200
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:52,268
Let me take you home
where it's safe.

201
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:52,712
Oh, you have
to look in the mirror.

202
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:54,728
Why?

203
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,587
Just do it.

204
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,627
Can I do you?

205
00:19:23,554 --> 00:19:25,921
Um, I've got too much hair.

206
00:19:26,054 --> 00:19:27,075
It won't work.

207
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,608
Get in.

208
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:17,573
You like it here?

209
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:19,457
In the tub?

210
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:22,676
No, I mean, in this house.

211
00:20:23,651 --> 00:20:25,168
I guess.

212
00:20:25,304 --> 00:20:27,340
Why don't you ever leave?

213
00:20:28,024 --> 00:20:29,895
I've left before.

214
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:32,541
I don't think the res counts.

215
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,090
It's on the outside.

216
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:36,715
Yeah, but I mean
like the real outside.

217
00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:39,684
Mom said there's nothing
but pain there.

218
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:42,560
She said that?

219
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:45,475
Yes. She came from there.

220
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:48,208
She said that...

221
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,575
it was filled with selfish people...

222
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,936
who didn't treat
each other very well.

223
00:20:54,473 --> 00:20:57,106
So, you've really
never been past the res?

224
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,520
Why would I?

225
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,317
I don't know, to...

226
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,552
go to school.

227
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,380
See a doctor, or...

228
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,809
go to your grandparents' houses...

229
00:21:07,848 --> 00:21:10,630
and have cups of tea
and listen to the same story...

230
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:12,654
10 times over.

231
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:15,044
I mean,
I can't believe it.

232
00:21:17,821 --> 00:21:19,750
Why are you laughing?

233
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,291
So, no one knows you exist?

234
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:36,408
Yeah. You do.

235
00:21:41,126 --> 00:21:43,712
You can look in the mirror now.

236
00:21:51,223 --> 00:21:52,824
Hm.

237
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,636
You're quite good at this.

238
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,980
Yeah.

239
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:14,822
I've never read any
of your mom's books.

240
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:20,564
I hear they're really depressing.

241
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:26,128
Mom said I'm not allowed
to read them until I turn 18.

242
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:28,674
How old are you now?

243
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,456
Sixteen.

244
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,321
Same.

245
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:41,626
"Lord!

246
00:22:41,665 --> 00:22:45,462
"How unutterably disgusting life is!

247
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,998
"What dirty tricks it plays on us!

248
00:22:49,063 --> 00:22:50,469
"Here we are among...

249
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:53,274
"the breadcrumbs and
the stained napkins again.

250
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:55,173
"The knife is already...

251
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,985
"Congealing.

252
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:00,352
"Congealing with grease.

253
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:02,860
- "Disorder, sordidity.
- "Sordidity.

254
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:05,384
"Sordidity...

255
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:07,540
"and corruption surrounds us.

256
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,376
"Call the waiter,
pay the bill.

257
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:11,452
"We must pull ourselves up
out of our chairs.

258
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,530
"We must find our coats.

259
00:23:13,555 --> 00:23:14,712
"We must go.

260
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:17,532
"Must, must, must,
detestable word.

261
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:20,055
"I who had thought
myself immune...

262
00:23:20,134 --> 00:23:23,040

tumbled me over...

00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:24,251

"leaving me to summon my forces,

00:23:27,134 --> 00:23:30,673
"rise and confront the enemy."

266
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,377
Why was that page marked?

267
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:44,953
Mom was showing it
to me in class.

268
00:23:45,845 --> 00:23:47,135
Wow.

269
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:48,706
What?

270
00:23:48,768 --> 00:23:51,057
I thought my mom was fucked.

271
00:23:55,246 --> 00:23:56,481
Sorry.

272
00:23:56,731 --> 00:23:59,285
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

273
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,989
Mom just felt everybody's pain.

274
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:06,590
But...

275
00:24:06,677 --> 00:24:08,786
she's free now.

276
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:19,572
What's your mom like?

277
00:24:20,283 --> 00:24:21,721
Uh.

278
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:24,346
Mm, she kinda sucks.

279
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,072
Why?

280
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,353
She just...

281
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:30,939
she has a lot of problems.

282
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,478
And her boyfriend is a dick.

283
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:40,430
It's quite nice being
away from it all actually.

284
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,617
I like spending time with you here.

285
00:24:49,297 --> 00:24:56,492
<i>♪ As late as the hour may be ♪</i>

286
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:00,531
<i>♪ Gimme your love ♪</i>

287
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:05,120
<i>♪ I need your love so bad ♪</i>

288
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:08,941
<i>♪ Gimme your love ♪</i>

289
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:13,573
<i>♪ I need your love so bad ♪</i>

290
00:25:48,157 --> 00:25:49,863
Purple.

291
00:25:51,057 --> 00:25:52,901
Rude.

292
00:25:54,714 --> 00:25:56,370
Ring.

293
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:01,910
Pinkie.

294
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,858
It's a bit late.

295
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:21,765
Have a seat.

296
00:27:28,839 --> 00:27:30,794
You want a beer?

297
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:37,052
Here you go.

298
00:27:37,077 --> 00:27:38,515
It's all right.

299
00:27:38,735 --> 00:27:40,443
It's okay.

300
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,064
So, where you been?

301
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,029
A friend's place.

302
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:54,311
What? Like a...

303
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:56,618
a boyfriend?

304
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:58,282
Hey.

305
00:27:58,821 --> 00:27:59,860
Look at you.

306
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:01,376
My little girl's all grown up.

307
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:02,848
I'm not your little girl, Mike.

308
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:09,950
Okay. So...

309
00:28:10,005 --> 00:28:12,286
do you have a boyfriend?

310
00:28:12,755 --> 00:28:14,543
It's okay if you do.

311
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,553
- I mean you're using protection-
- I really need to go.

312
00:28:22,851 --> 00:28:24,013
Yeah, goodnight, Mike.

313
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:26,290
- I'm just playing.
- Goodnight.

314
00:28:47,153 --> 00:28:49,731
I got whatever I could
before Mom woke up.

315
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:50,913
There's a lot.

316
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:53,998
There's lollies and chewy.

317
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:55,506
These are really good.

318
00:28:55,531 --> 00:28:56,552
Oh, and...

319
00:28:56,577 --> 00:28:58,594
- lollies with bugs in them.
- Wait, what's that?

320
00:28:58,652 --> 00:29:00,459
Mm, strawberry milk.

321
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,339
You want some?

322
00:29:02,631 --> 00:29:05,107
- Strawberry milk?
- It's really good.

323
00:29:05,147 --> 00:29:06,287
Mm.

324
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:08,068
You'll like it.

325
00:29:09,268 --> 00:29:11,021
Purple promise.

326
00:29:19,036 --> 00:29:22,171
Okay, no.
Don't choke, don't choke.

327
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:23,507
All right.

328
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,648
Hang on.

329
00:29:24,677 --> 00:29:26,671
Guess what else I brought?

330
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,713
Blah blah blah blah blah blah.

331
00:29:40,143 --> 00:29:42,024
My mother said...

332
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:43,790
the fences...

333
00:29:43,837 --> 00:29:46,212
were the walls of her womb.

334
00:29:48,606 --> 00:29:52,622
Said she could only protect me
if I stayed inside,

335
00:29:55,449 --> 00:29:57,617
away from everyone,

336
00:29:57,665 --> 00:29:59,860
from everything.

337
00:30:24,628 --> 00:30:26,460
I made these.

338
00:30:36,956 --> 00:30:38,909
These ones are my favourite.

339
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:40,481
Brave.

340
00:30:41,059 --> 00:30:42,599
Badass.

341
00:30:42,699 --> 00:30:45,481
I'm gonna sell them
at the market or something.

342
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:47,989
They're my ticket outta here.

343
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,215
Where do you want to go?

344
00:30:50,731 --> 00:30:52,332
Somewhere.

345
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,841
Anywhere.

346
00:30:57,874 --> 00:30:59,488
Do you like them?

347
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:04,035
They're very...

348
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:05,465
colorful.

349
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:06,809
Okay.

350
00:31:06,971 --> 00:31:10,338
Tell me one thing
that you like about yourself.

351
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:15,737
Okay.

352
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,226
I'll tell you.

353
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,732
You hardly know me.

354
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:23,649
I know enough.

355
00:31:33,154 --> 00:31:34,368
Smart?

356
00:31:34,431 --> 00:31:36,071
Aren't you?

357
00:31:42,404 --> 00:31:44,293
What else?

358
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,708
Am I pretty?

359
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:06,058
Now,

360
00:32:06,113 --> 00:32:08,871
choose your favourite color from here.

361
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:12,964
I think I like this one.

362
00:32:14,144 --> 00:32:15,902
Turquoise.

363
00:32:16,394 --> 00:32:18,253
Turquoise.

364
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:21,199
Yeah, I like turquoise.

365
00:32:21,542 --> 00:32:23,089
Okay.

366
00:32:23,222 --> 00:32:24,769
What you do,

367
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:25,878
thread,

368
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:27,207
hold it.

369
00:32:41,305 --> 00:32:43,125
You're a natural.

370
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:45,656
You'll have to help me.

371
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,497
Come on!

372
00:33:07,923 --> 00:33:10,794
It's 200,000 degrees.

373
00:33:19,134 --> 00:33:20,886
Come on.

374
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:37,549
What's wrong?

375
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:42,572
The best way to overcome a fear
is to confront it.

376
00:33:42,885 --> 00:33:44,619
I'm serious.

377
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:46,322
Right.

378
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:48,651
I heard it on the TV
and everything.

379
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:53,634
Come on.

380
00:33:55,841 --> 00:33:57,618
Come on.

381
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,197
Hey! Hey.

382
00:34:07,268 --> 00:34:09,603
You can't tell me
that didn't feel good?

383
00:34:12,875 --> 00:34:14,925
How, how deep is it?

384
00:34:14,972 --> 00:34:16,558
Not deep.

385
00:34:16,784 --> 00:34:18,230
See?

386
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:37,908
You're okay.

387
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,025
Come on.
I'll help you through it.

388
00:34:44,673 --> 00:34:46,129
- Okay.
- You ready?

389
00:34:46,662 --> 00:34:47,934
Don't.

390
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:49,311
Okay.

391
00:34:50,036 --> 00:34:52,069
Three, two.

392
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:02,145
Claudia, Claudia, hey, hey.

393
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:05,019
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

394
00:35:05,044 --> 00:35:06,137
Hey.

395
00:35:06,176 --> 00:35:07,278
Okay, breathe in.

396
00:35:07,317 --> 00:35:08,444
Breathe in.

397
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,811
Breathe out.

398
00:35:10,054 --> 00:35:11,139
Breathe with me.

399
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,381
Hey, breathe with me.

400
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,498
In.

401
00:35:15,718 --> 00:35:17,514
Out.

402
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:20,067
Breathe in.

403
00:35:21,638 --> 00:35:23,005
Out.

404
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:26,114
Hey.

405
00:35:28,516 --> 00:35:30,013
Hey.

406
00:35:44,404 --> 00:35:46,112
Keep looking at me.

407
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:47,479
Okay?

408
00:35:47,675 --> 00:35:48,955
Okay.

409
00:35:49,462 --> 00:35:51,174
Help me, okay?

410
00:35:51,557 --> 00:35:52,846
Okay.

411
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,705
Okay.

412
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:57,448
It's okay.

413
00:35:58,872 --> 00:36:00,135
Three,

414
00:36:00,268 --> 00:36:01,541
two,

415
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,416
one.

416
00:36:33,521 --> 00:36:34,739
Go ah.

417
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,036
Ah.

418
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,441
Oh.

419
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,917
Oh, I'm so bad at this.

420
00:36:44,691 --> 00:36:47,324
Oh, did you see that?

421
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,706
Oh.

422
00:36:54,894 --> 00:36:56,424
Lucky charm.

423
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:59,214
You can have it.

424
00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:02,737
Can I still eat it?

425
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:12,854
Feel lucky?

426
00:37:13,502 --> 00:37:14,854
Yes.

427
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:30,598
I don't really know how
I'm supposed to be feeling.

428
00:37:33,653 --> 00:37:35,434
You make me think...

429
00:37:37,284 --> 00:37:40,090
that all the stuff
my mom taught me in class,

430
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:42,836
about the world being cruel,
about people being...

431
00:37:42,903 --> 00:37:44,512
monsters,

432
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:48,754
is all a lie.

433
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:57,997
How do you know
I'm not a monster?

434
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,538
Do you think you are?

435
00:38:06,506 --> 00:38:09,092
Not many people like me, though.

436
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,512
Because monsters...

437
00:38:18,552 --> 00:38:21,301
only like other monsters.

438
00:38:34,641 --> 00:38:36,089
Okay.

439
00:38:36,121 --> 00:38:38,011
Welcome.

440
00:38:42,745 --> 00:38:45,682
I've got that poem
here somewhere.

441
00:38:48,975 --> 00:38:50,401
Okay.

442
00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:03,616
"When Day is Over"
by Lesbia Harford.

443
00:39:07,381 --> 00:39:08,866
"When day is over

444
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,750
"I climb up the stair

445
00:39:11,054 --> 00:39:12,905
"Take off my dark dress

446
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,859
"Pull down my hair

447
00:39:15,195 --> 00:39:16,312
"Open my window

448
00:39:16,351 --> 00:39:18,296
"And look at the stars

449
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:20,937
"Then my heart breaks through

450
00:39:20,976 --> 00:39:22,116
"These prison bars

451
00:39:22,141 --> 00:39:23,890
"Of space and darkness

452
00:39:23,953 --> 00:39:26,172
"And finds what is true

453
00:39:26,905 --> 00:39:28,280
"Up past the stars

454
00:39:28,328 --> 00:39:29,804
"Where I'm one...

455
00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:31,367
"with you"

456
00:39:47,503 --> 00:39:49,511
I like that image...

457
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:53,902
of a heart breaking
through prison bars.

458
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,796
Can I feel it?

459
00:40:02,226 --> 00:40:03,864
Feel what?

460
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:06,937
Your heart.

461
00:40:37,283 --> 00:40:39,367
Can you hear it?

462
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:41,812
Yeah.

463
00:40:44,646 --> 00:40:46,454
Is it okay?

464
00:40:48,441 --> 00:40:49,841
Yeah.

465
00:40:58,536 --> 00:41:01,739
It should be broken,
shouldn't it?

466
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,453
Shock can make you numb and...

467
00:41:10,711 --> 00:41:12,539
I don't feel numb.

468
00:41:17,593 --> 00:41:20,720
I feel more alive
than I've ever felt.

469
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:25,179
I'm sorry.

470
00:41:25,204 --> 00:41:28,056
- I shouldn't have said that.
- Maybe, I should sit down.

471
00:41:40,107 --> 00:41:42,138
Your mom would have
wanted you to be happy.

472
00:41:42,175 --> 00:41:44,132
Maybe, you should go.

473
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,187
What?

474
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:49,715
I need you to go.

475
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:52,934
I need you to go.

476
00:41:55,135 --> 00:41:57,434
- Claudia, I'm-
- I said go.

477
00:41:58,778 --> 00:42:00,255
Go!

478
00:42:02,185 --> 00:42:03,826
Get out!

479
00:42:31,305 --> 00:42:32,831
<i>My mother said...</i>

480
00:42:32,933 --> 00:42:34,784
<i>there would come a time...</i>

481
00:42:34,816 --> 00:42:37,034

482
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,503

<i>But when the time came,</i>

487
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,707
<i>I couldn't do it.</i>

Hey.

511
00:46:05,831 --> 00:46:08,046
Hey, there's a dog here.

512
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:11,445
Oh, hey.

513
00:46:11,633 --> 00:46:13,242
What's your name buddy?

514
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:14,953
Tilly, no.

515
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,719
Tilly.

516
00:46:17,629 --> 00:46:19,875
Aren't you a beautiful girl, huh?

517
00:46:20,453 --> 00:46:21,514
See?

518
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:23,602
I told you it was worth a look.

519
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,609
Just take her out to the car.

520
00:46:25,634 --> 00:46:27,773
I'll give the place
a bit of a once over.

521
00:46:27,972 --> 00:46:29,258
Okay.

522
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:31,281
Come on, come on.

523
00:46:48,861 --> 00:46:51,088
"Diving into concrete".

524
00:47:57,766 --> 00:47:59,144
Good girl.

525
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:05,997
What's that?

526
00:48:06,075 --> 00:48:08,645
Signed copy
of one of her books.

527
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:10,934
Who's it addressed to?

528
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,216
Why?

529
00:48:12,262 --> 00:48:14,997
'Cause why would she keep
a signed copy of her own book?

530
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:19,650
"My darling, Claudia.

531
00:48:19,675 --> 00:48:21,416
"I love you more than anything.

532
00:48:21,479 --> 00:48:23,158
"You are my world."

533
00:48:23,721 --> 00:48:24,900
Who's Claudia?

534
00:48:24,925 --> 00:48:26,596
That could be a lead.

535
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:28,424
So, it's a murder
investigation now?

536
00:48:28,468 --> 00:48:30,291
We don't know.

537
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:39,936
Where are you headed?

538
00:49:39,973 --> 00:49:42,100
I'm just going for a ride.

539
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:44,655
Tilly?

540
00:49:47,496 --> 00:49:49,387
You know this dog?

541
00:49:49,956 --> 00:49:51,027
Yeah.

542
00:49:51,082 --> 00:49:53,520
Yeah, I've been looking
for her all morning.

543
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:54,957
Where'd you find her?

544
00:49:54,996 --> 00:49:57,176
Up at Veronica Fox's place.

545
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,231
Any idea what
she'd be doing there?

546
00:49:59,324 --> 00:50:00,488
No.

547
00:50:00,676 --> 00:50:03,176
No, we're always finding
her in weird places.

548
00:50:03,317 --> 00:50:05,442
I've never seen a dog
up at your place.

549
00:50:05,496 --> 00:50:07,395
Well she's an inside dog.

550
00:50:07,598 --> 00:50:08,645
And...

551
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,082
she's shy.

552
00:50:27,362 --> 00:50:29,171
Tilly, hey, hey.

553
00:50:29,196 --> 00:50:31,469
Well, she looks happy
to see you.

554
00:50:33,018 --> 00:50:35,805
You should put an address
on that collar.

555
00:50:36,047 --> 00:50:37,313
I will.

556
00:50:38,085 --> 00:50:39,914
Thanks for finding her.

557
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:42,651
Alright, let's go.

558
00:50:48,855 --> 00:50:50,285
Okay.

559
00:50:53,096 --> 00:50:55,095
Be careful on the road.

560
00:50:56,257 --> 00:50:58,640
- Stay away from the res.
- Yes.

561
00:51:02,585 --> 00:51:05,586
Let's get you back
to your mama, okay?

562
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:08,435
She's gonna be beside herself.

563
00:51:15,347 --> 00:51:16,761
Come on, Tilly.

564
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,175
Let's go.

565
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:19,691
Let's go.

566
00:51:20,355 --> 00:51:22,355
Good girl!

567
00:51:22,995 --> 00:51:24,206
I'm gonna race you.

568
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:26,316
I'm gonna race you.

569
00:51:27,962 --> 00:51:31,561
<i>♪ Do you really want

570
00:51:33,386 --> 00:51:36,988
<i>♪ Do you really want

571
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:54,185
Claudia?

572
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,287
It's me.

573
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:03,665
Oh, Tilly.

574
00:52:03,962 --> 00:52:05,368
Tilly.

575
00:52:11,184 --> 00:52:12,811
Thank you.

576
00:52:13,398 --> 00:52:14,421
Yeah.

577
00:52:14,457 --> 00:52:16,147
Thank you.

578
00:52:19,142 --> 00:52:21,216
I saw the cops.

579
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,014
They're not coming back.

580
00:52:28,035 --> 00:52:30,706
Please, don't leave again.

581
00:52:33,311 --> 00:52:35,175
I won't.

582
00:52:35,683 --> 00:52:37,269
I won't.

583
00:52:55,076 --> 00:52:56,895
Coffee.

584
00:52:57,223 --> 00:52:59,465
I never tried it.

585
00:53:00,652 --> 00:53:02,059
Me neither, but...

586
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:04,215
I've always wanted to have...

587
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:07,012
black coffee in the morning.

588
00:53:08,094 --> 00:53:10,214
You know, one day,
I'm gonna be...

589
00:53:10,254 --> 00:53:14,152
one of those ladies that sits
on her back porch and...

590
00:53:14,254 --> 00:53:16,717
reads the newspaper and...

591
00:53:16,796 --> 00:53:18,975
has her coffee and just like...

592
00:53:19,053 --> 00:53:22,707
sighs at everything with
total satisfaction.

593
00:53:22,879 --> 00:53:24,363
I can see that.

594
00:53:24,426 --> 00:53:27,270
You'd be wearing a long dress
and lots of jewels.

595
00:53:27,324 --> 00:53:28,605
Mm.

596
00:53:28,684 --> 00:53:30,215
Okay.

597
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:34,639
Cheers, darling.

598
00:53:43,156 --> 00:53:44,804
That's disgusting.

599
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:47,281
That's so gross.

600
00:53:47,336 --> 00:53:49,351
Mm, wait, wait, wait.
I know how to fix this.

601
00:53:49,424 --> 00:53:51,968
Wait one sec, one sec, one sec.

602
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:57,798
So.

603
00:53:58,892 --> 00:53:59,939
What are those?

604
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,259
We don't have any sugar
cubes or anything, but...

605
00:54:02,284 --> 00:54:03,462
I've got these.

606
00:54:03,501 --> 00:54:05,595
What do they taste...?

607
00:54:06,165 --> 00:54:07,274
Mm, mm.

608
00:54:07,299 --> 00:54:08,470
Mm!

609
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,507
Yum!

610
00:54:09,532 --> 00:54:10,587
Yeah.

611
00:54:10,618 --> 00:54:12,509
So fluffy, like...

612
00:54:12,564 --> 00:54:13,829
- Clouds.
- Clouds.

613
00:54:13,854 --> 00:54:14,892
Like clouds, I know.

614
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:16,603
So good.

615
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:25,691

622
00:54:43,765 --> 00:54:45,535
I've been thinking that...

623
00:54:45,598 --> 00:54:46,832
um...

624
00:54:47,293 --> 00:54:49,988
maybe, we could
redecorate your room.

625
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:52,222
Why?

626
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:54,771
You know, for a bit of color.

627
00:54:54,886 --> 00:54:56,771
I don't know, it feels...

628
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:59,029
it feels weird changing...

629
00:54:59,069 --> 00:55:00,989
our room so soon.

630
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,310
Our room?

631
00:55:03,853 --> 00:55:06,685
Yeah. Mine and Mom's.

632
00:55:09,191 --> 00:55:10,589
Oh.

633
00:55:12,284 --> 00:55:14,159
I wouldn't know how to do it.

634
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:15,449
Do what?

635
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:17,417
Decorate.

636
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:19,683
Well...

637
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:23,706
lucky you got me.

638
00:55:26,182 --> 00:55:27,651
Okay.

639
00:55:31,939 --> 00:55:34,049
Let's start with the walls.

640
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:37,080
Are we going to paint them?

641
00:55:37,157 --> 00:55:38,525
Better.

642
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,564
You know all these people?

643
00:55:41,595 --> 00:55:42,977
I wish.

644
00:55:43,002 --> 00:55:44,103
Here.

645
00:55:44,134 --> 00:55:45,806
What, what do we do with them?

646
00:55:45,831 --> 00:55:48,114
You stick them on your walls.

647
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:51,989
These are your new guardian angels.

648
00:55:58,168 --> 00:56:02,582
The trick with collaging
is just not to overthink it.

649
00:56:02,738 --> 00:56:06,762
Just put them up wherever
it feels right and it can be messy.

650
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,520
It's Tavi Gevinson.

651
00:56:13,145 --> 00:56:15,153
What's she like?

652
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,340
Clever.

653
00:56:31,607 --> 00:56:34,998
That's Joan Didion and Beyonce.

654
00:56:42,317 --> 00:56:43,649
Okay.

655
00:56:43,728 --> 00:56:45,275
I love it.

656
00:56:47,652 --> 00:56:49,399
Now, the bed.

657
00:56:56,164 --> 00:56:57,839
What are you doing?

658
00:56:57,917 --> 00:56:59,596
You'll see.
Go on.

659
00:56:59,657 --> 00:57:01,706
Take your covers off.

660
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,934
How many do we need?

661
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,713
I don't know,

662
00:57:32,627 --> 00:57:35,830
I guess it depends how dark
we want the dye to be.

663
00:57:37,532 --> 00:57:39,369
Not too dark.

664
00:57:40,713 --> 00:57:43,111
Hope it turns out to be purple...

665
00:57:43,307 --> 00:57:45,284
rather than blue.

666
00:57:48,992 --> 00:57:50,469
Same.

667
00:57:52,304 --> 00:57:53,602
Well...

668
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,219
whatever the color is,
it will be...

669
00:57:56,328 --> 00:57:58,555
way better than white.

670
00:58:01,503 --> 00:58:02,753
Mm.

671
00:58:06,696 --> 00:58:08,791
It's like a cubby house.

672
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:10,862
Come in here.

673
00:58:26,874 --> 00:58:28,195
Ow.

674
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:29,578
What?

675
00:58:29,617 --> 00:58:31,092
- Ah!
- Hey, you okay?

676
00:58:31,117 --> 00:58:33,297
Yeah, just got a prickle.

677
00:58:33,836 --> 00:58:36,179
Let me see.

678
00:58:38,456 --> 00:58:40,589
Mm, better?

679
00:58:50,234 --> 00:58:51,895
Better?

680
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:04,541
Better?

681
00:59:04,576 --> 00:59:06,135
Mm-mm.

682
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:13,119

Mm, so yummy.

707
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,481
Mm.

708
01:01:07,343 --> 01:01:08,921
Beautiful.

709
01:01:10,515 --> 01:01:12,030
Oh.

710
01:01:12,234 --> 01:01:14,054
Why did you do that?

711
01:01:14,101 --> 01:01:18,062
All will be revealed
in about five minutes.

712
01:01:23,177 --> 01:01:25,330
- Hey.
- Mm-mm.

713
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:27,893
Guess the flavour.

714
01:01:34,068 --> 01:01:35,849
Apple.

715
01:01:38,302 --> 01:01:40,201
Beginner's luck.

716
01:01:41,084 --> 01:01:43,108
- All right.
- Mm-mm.

717
01:01:44,792 --> 01:01:46,219
This one.

718
01:01:49,234 --> 01:01:50,814
Mm.

719
01:01:50,884 --> 01:01:52,619
I love this one.

720
01:01:52,705 --> 01:01:54,455
Watermelon?

721
01:01:55,396 --> 01:01:57,759
You'll never guess this one.

722
01:01:57,949 --> 01:01:59,962
It's really hard.

723
01:02:03,515 --> 01:02:05,841
This one is limited edition.

724
01:02:07,853 --> 01:02:09,560
- Do you give up?
- No.

725
01:02:09,616 --> 01:02:11,983
- No, no. I...
- Do you want a hint?

726
01:02:13,004 --> 01:02:14,272
Yeah.

727
01:02:29,765 --> 01:02:31,085
Good.

728
01:02:32,322 --> 01:02:34,913
I've never tasted it before.

729
01:02:35,444 --> 01:02:37,030
It's cola.

730
01:02:38,482 --> 01:02:39,929
Cola.

731
01:02:42,142 --> 01:02:43,924
Do you want another?

732
01:02:44,682 --> 01:02:46,019
Okay.

733
01:02:58,425 --> 01:03:00,378
Strawberry?

734
01:03:03,964 --> 01:03:06,849
It reminds me of strawberry milk.

735
01:03:27,652 --> 01:03:30,971
Do you think that someone's
going to come looking for you?

736
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:36,505
No one really cares to do
that sort of thing with me.

737
01:03:37,232 --> 01:03:38,880
Which is fine.

738
01:03:48,263 --> 01:03:50,560
Not even if you stay out late?

739
01:03:51,826 --> 01:03:53,455
Probably not.

740
01:03:55,612 --> 01:03:58,075
Not even if you stay overnight?

741
01:04:01,528 --> 01:04:03,310
Why do you ask?

742
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:30,351
Do you like it?

743
01:04:32,476 --> 01:04:34,062
I love it.

744
01:04:38,707 --> 01:04:41,445
I think I really like you.

745
01:04:43,164 --> 01:04:46,133
I think I really like you too.

746
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:29,247
I don't know what to do.

747
01:05:29,523 --> 01:05:31,340
Me neither.

748
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:41,339
Maybe, we can start
by breathing together.

749
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:49,101
- Ready?
- Okay.

750
01:05:49,922 --> 01:05:51,407
In.

751
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:55,608

It's the law.

801
01:11:12,318 --> 01:11:14,085
The law says that
if you're under 17,

- then you're a kid.
- Yeah, but I'm taking care of her.
