1
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,944
- Hey.
- I'm at the gallery, where are you?

2
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:33,598
Why would I be at the gallery?

3
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:35,644
It's your gallery.

4
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:37,472
He's not here either,
by the way.

5
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:39,300
- Who?
- Alan Paloma.

6
00:00:39,343 --> 00:00:41,345
Alan doesn't
go to the openings.

7
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:44,087
- He will be at my place later.
- OK, but you're sure he's coming?

8
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:46,089
How many times
do we have to go over this?

9
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:49,832
- OK, I just need to be sure.
- Just get your ass over here.

10
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,400
- What about the opening?
- Fuck the opening.

11
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:21,228
Watch it!

12
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:23,969
Oh, fuck.

13
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:25,449
What the hell is wrong with you?

14
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:28,191
Holy shit, I'm so sorry.

15
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:30,150
- What happened to looking?
- Are you OK?

16
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:32,326
What can I do?
Can I call someone?

17
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:36,460
This is a custom bike.

18
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:37,940
Goddammit!

19
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:39,985
Fucking hell.

20
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:41,552
This is a custom bike!

21
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:42,988
Did you hear what I said?

22
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:47,515
- About how expensive it is?
- No, you could've hurt somebody.

23
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,909
You know how many people are killed in
accidents every year just like this.

24
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:53,738
You're trivializing
a very serious issue.

25
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:54,696
What is this?

26
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,786
This is what
you look at right now.

27
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,271
I'm sorry. I really am.

28
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:06,795
OK, fine,
just be careful.

29
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,884
I will, promise.

30
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,628
- Be careful.
- I promise.

31
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:23,551
Rachel reads
Ryan's raunchy writing.

32
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:25,944
Rachel reads
Ryan's raunchy writing.

33
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,990
Rachel reads
Ryan's raunchy writing.

34
00:03:28,033 --> 00:03:30,688
Rachel reads
Ryan's raunchy writing.

35
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:33,125
Raunchy writing.

36
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:51,231
Wr... wr... wr... writing.

37
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:55,887
Gavin, get the door!

38
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:00,762
Was that the door?

39
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,155
Julia?

40
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:09,466
Gavin!

41
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:27,092
Holy shit.

42
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,574
This is Charlie's apartment?

43
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:35,884
Lan, what's up?

44
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,584
Good to see you.

45
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:42,717
Lana, this is my friend, Julia.

46
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,675
Lana, is one of Charlie's
new friends.

47
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:47,069
Mm, not that new.

48
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:50,464
So, what, did you meet Charlie
at some stupid art world thing?

49
00:04:50,507 --> 00:04:52,030
Uh, no.

50
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:55,120
Well, yeah, I guess, kind of.

51
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:56,470
Lana's a photographer.

52
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,602
Oh, is that what's
in the portfolio, nudes?

53
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:00,082
Not nudes.

54
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,172
- Here.
- Oh.

55
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:06,871
Ignore her, she's an only child.

56
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:08,830
Oh, I brought wine.

57
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:13,704
- Oh...
- Is that Lana?

58
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:17,447
- Hey, Charlie.
- Can you make me a drink?

59
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,108
What would Charlie drink?

60
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:28,980
Literally anything.

61
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,990
So, what's up with you, Charlie
said something about this play.

62
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:41,602
I'm doing a one-man version

63
00:05:41,645 --> 00:05:44,387
of A Midsummer Night's Dream.

64
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:45,823
Doesn't that have a huge cast?

65
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:47,695
It did.

66
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,958
I'm totally reinventing it.

67
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,312
Jesus! Dim the lights!

68
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,185
Not for you.

69
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:05,190
That woman in there,
watch out for her.

70
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:06,714
She's got shark eyes.

71
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:11,588
I don't know why Gavin
finds her so amusing.

72
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:14,112
She's brain dead.

73
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:16,898
Are you and Gavin...
together now?

74
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:18,421
He's fun.

75
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:20,597
His one-man-show thing
is exciting.

76
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,425
His one-man-show thing
is not a real thing.

77
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:25,297
Anyway, what did you think
about the gallery tonight?

78
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:31,434
Come on... tell me.
What did you think?

79
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:33,697
That sort of thing
is over my head.

80
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:39,355
- Um... it's pretty aggressive.
- Stupid. You can say it.

81
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,878
I thought it was just me.

82
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:42,227
Oh, it is just you.

83
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:44,621
People think their shit...
is amazing.

84
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:45,753
They're into violence.

85
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,624
The juxtaposition of America's,

86
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:49,234
blah, blah, blah...

87
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:51,846
Look, they're just a couple
of party-boy dingbats,

88
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,415
but they might also be geniuses,
I'm not sure.

89
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,940
But they are definitely going
to be huge, people love them.

90
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,769
Stupidity sells, Lana.

91
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:04,162
It's... it's why you're poor.

92
00:07:05,163 --> 00:07:06,730
Speaking of which...

93
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:15,478
Hmm...

94
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:16,436
What?

95
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:22,093
Relax, Lana, it's good.

96
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:24,487
I hadn't seen
some of this newer work.

97
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,488
I like it.

98
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:28,012
You hardly looked at it.

99
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:30,798
Lana, I don't have to look
at art to know that it's good.

100
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,321
OK, look...

101
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:35,193
This one...

102
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:39,023
- Twelve-feet wide, right?
- You think so?

103
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,678
Yes.

104
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:43,375
Alan loves this shit.

105
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:44,986
I worked for the man
for four years,

106
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,727
I know him
better than his wife.

107
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,163
Let's get some shots.

108
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,382
Charlie...
two minutes.

109
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:52,167
I just wanna get this right.

110
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,603
Then have a drink.

111
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:55,126
We shouldn't have to
do this at a party.

112
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,911
Can't we just set up a meeting
with him at his gallery?

113
00:07:56,954 --> 00:08:00,262
Lanny, he doesn't exactly
keep office hours.

114
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:02,046
He's not a college professor.

115
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,441
This, out there,
that's how you do business.

116
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,575
I'm doing you a favor.

117
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:11,360
All right, well,
what do you think?

118
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,014
What'll Alan like?

119
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,842
Alan is going to like you.

120
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,887
So, stop being so worried.

121
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:18,628
I just really need
something to give, you know,

122
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:21,762
I feel like I'm constantly
on the edge of something.

123
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,199
I got a call the other day
to shoot photos

124
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:25,679
for the city's best cupcakes.

125
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,158
Work is work.

126
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:29,552
They wanna pay me
in cupcake coupons.

127
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:33,121
You just need champagne.

128
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:34,949
No, I don't, seriously.

129
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:37,168
When Alan gets here I wanna have
a serious conversation with him

130
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:39,693
about my career,
I can't be wasted.

131
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:42,870
You drink... I'll pick your art.

132
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:44,524
That a girl.

133
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,351
Start with that one, I love it.

134
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:48,223
Then those two and those.

135
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:51,269
These you don't have to
bother with.

136
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:54,490
See? Wasn't that easy?
Perfect, done.

137
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,362
Thanks, seriously, thank you.

138
00:08:57,406 --> 00:09:00,365
I have something special.

139
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:02,803
And I want you to see it,
come on.

140
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,853
You hung these!

141
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:13,030
Of course, they're good.

142
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:15,511
If you're gonna be an artist, you
gotta learn how to play it cool

143
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,601
when you see your own art.

144
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,908
Besides, this is
what I wanted to show you.

145
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,301
Jesus, Charlie!

146
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,694
This is fucking awesome!

147
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,609
Don't point a gun at me, ever.

148
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:29,481
It's not loaded, is it?

149
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:31,614
Of course, it's loaded, Lana.

150
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:32,789
I'm not a hypocrite.

151
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,145
Be careful with that.

152
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:49,763
Oh... you think I'm gonna
give myself diabetes.

153
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,286
OK, give it to me.

154
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:54,419
Violence, Lana,
it's called a theme.

155
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:55,812
- I'm taking it now.
- No.

156
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:01,949
You're just gonna
leave that out?

157
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:03,603
Killjoy.

158
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:11,436
Safe as kittens.

159
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,136
And just so there are
no misunderstandings...

160
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:24,406
There. Now, it's fashion.

161
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:25,668
Hello?

162
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:28,497
Where is everyone?

163
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,325
- Hello.
- Hey!

164
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:32,980
- Look at you.
- I know, I'm a blimp.

165
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:35,678
No, way, you look amazing.

166
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:38,159
- Yeah.
- You know what's amazing?

167
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:41,379
No matter what time I get here, I'm
always the first one to arrive.

168
00:10:41,423 --> 00:10:44,644
Prettiest fat girl at the party.

169
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:45,949
Hi.

170
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,083
What are you doing here?

171
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,651
We can't both miss our opening.

172
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:53,304
The girls can close it up.

173
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,308
Is that one of Tony's?

174
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:59,223
I've been looking
for that painting?

175
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:02,836
Wow, sounds like you're gonna be...
super fun tonight.

176
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,968
I'm trying to sell
that painting, Charlie.

177
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:11,932
You shouldn't even be here.

178
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:20,941
I need a drink.

179
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,466
Enjoy the show?

180
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:35,520
Hi, I wanted to
introduce myself.

181
00:11:35,564 --> 00:11:37,087
Yeah, why?

182
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,314
No one has
a regular beer anymore.

183
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,013
I'm Lana, we met once before.

184
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:54,191
Adrian Tyler's girlfriend.

185
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:55,758
No...

186
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,586
Just a friend of
Charlie's.

187
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,241
- Filmmaker.
- Photographer.

188
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:01,416
Right.

189
00:12:03,418 --> 00:12:06,247
Charlie was just
talking about you.

190
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,859
You know...
maybe you could help me out.

191
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:16,692
Do you think you could get me some
alone time... to talk to Charlie?

192
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,129
Why don't you just
talk to her yourself?

193
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:22,089
We're business partners, it's...
complicated.

194
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:25,135
No, it's better if you tell her
she should talk to me.

195
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:29,009
Tell her you think
it's important.

196
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:32,490
So, Oberon comes out,

197
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:35,406
and he's like this
Jersey goombah, right.

198
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,017
And he's, like,

199
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,760
"Yo, I met by moonlight,
proud Titania,

200
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,849
And his wife, Titania,
she's like right out of

201
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:44,633
one of these Housewivesshows.

202
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:47,941
and she's like,
"What? Fucking jealous, Oberon,

203
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,856
fucking fairies, skip hence,

204
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:54,208
I have forsworn
to his fucking bed and company."

205
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:56,993
It's all Shakespeare though,
I'm just adding the fuckings.

206
00:12:57,037 --> 00:13:00,736
No one cares about
your play, Gavin.

207
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:04,566
God, he's so obsessed.

208
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:11,225
There's really
a little person in there?

209
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:15,011
Yeah, there's a little
person in there.

210
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,059
Pregnant women are so sexy.

211
00:13:19,102 --> 00:13:21,888
Julia, that's enough.

212
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,846
Why don't you have
some more champagne?

213
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,893
I'm not drinking
tonight, I'm on a cleanse.

214
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:30,331
- OK, Gavin...
- Hey, Jules, let's go.

215
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:35,118
- He's cute.
- Yeah.

216
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:37,468
So is she.

217
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:38,730
Yeah.

218
00:13:40,036 --> 00:13:41,908
Which one are you fucking?

219
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,781
In which sense of the word?

220
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,739
Unbelievable.

221
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,276
You made it.

222
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:04,104
It's so great to see you.

223
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,673
You look great.
Have you been working out?

224
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:13,243
Oh! Congratulations!

225
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:15,028
You ask before you touch.

226
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:17,944
- May I...
- No, no, no, no.

227
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:21,599
- Go away. Go away.
- But I asked.

228
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:23,993
- No, no, no.
- OK.

229
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:26,691
That was rude.

230
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:28,389
Well, it was nice
meeting you both.

231
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:29,738
Oh, thanks.

232
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:39,835
But, you know,
that's just in the first act,

233
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,707
but after that...
Lana!

234
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:45,928
- Where the hell have you been?
- Oh, you know, party stuff.

235
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:48,409
Walk away, walk away.

236
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,628
Can you just be me for the night
so that I can go home?

237
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:52,717
We're too cute
to leave this party.

238
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:56,591
No. I'm gonna
turn you over to Julia.

239
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,636
Jules, look after this one.

240
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,942
Make sure she has fun.

241
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,945
Hmm-hmm.

242
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,991
Hmm.

243
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,689
Let's get into some trouble!

244
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:09,647
- Trouble?
- Yeah.

245
00:15:09,691 --> 00:15:11,040
This thing Abby said to me,

246
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:12,781
we literally met
four times already,

247
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:15,001
and I said, "Well, you must not
have left a big...

248
00:15:15,044 --> 00:15:17,351
You people can't be out here.

249
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:19,440
This is a common space.

250
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:23,879
It's a common space,
you can't smoke...

251
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,011
in a common space.

252
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:27,535
That's a wild helmet.

253
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:30,886
Why does it smell like piss?

254
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:37,284
Are you putting your cigarette
butts out on the carpet?

255
00:15:37,327 --> 00:15:39,416
Is that OK?
You can't do that!

256
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,244
It's carpet, it burns.

257
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:46,380
See, and then I never again
forgot her name after that.

258
00:15:46,423 --> 00:15:50,036
Excuse me, do you know
where Charlotte is?

259
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:56,390
Ahh...

260
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:00,133
We should talk to boys.

261
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,483
This is more of, like,
a networking party, you know.

262
00:16:02,526 --> 00:16:05,355
Are there even any boys
to talk to?

263
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,794
Look around.
There are tons of boys here.

264
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:10,970
Hey, ladies.

265
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,147
Hi. I'm Amesh.

266
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,322
Lana.

267
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:17,019
Nice to meet you.

268
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,195
- Julia.
- Julia?

269
00:16:20,588 --> 00:16:21,458
A pleasure.

270
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:22,851
Ohh, not yet.

271
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:27,334
Right. What do you do, Lana?

272
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:28,596
She is a photographer.

273
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,901
Mm...

274
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,816
Nudes? Right?

275
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,949
- Exactly, right?
- Not nudes.

276
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,605
- Not nudes.
- You should do nudes, there's more money in nudes.

277
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:40,042
Totally, I've got
five nudes in my office.

278
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,262
Oh, I'm a dentist. Bam!

279
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,656
Come see me.

280
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,442
Seriously, I'd love to
get in your mouth.

281
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:56,232
How do you feel about
throwing a man off a building?

282
00:16:56,276 --> 00:16:57,842
As like an art-thing?

283
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:59,757
No, this is a murder-thing.

284
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:02,543
My new upstairs neighbor just
came down, he's a total loser.

285
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:05,372
They're trying to turn
the building into a co-op.

286
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:08,070
Actually, they want to turn the
entire fucking city into a co-op.

287
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:09,854
They wanna kick me out, Lana.

288
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,076
You should do a story on me.
Photoshoot with me.

289
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,164
Uh...

290
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:20,126
- I was talking to Dennis.
- Why? Why would you do that?

291
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:23,172
- He was being weird.
- Yeah, he's Dennis.

292
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:26,654
Well, he says he needs to
talk to you, sounded serious.

293
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:30,745
Nothing that idiot has to say
is ever serious.

294
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:33,878
I can't make you have fun
at this party.

295
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:35,358
I want to but...

296
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:37,273
don't get caught
in his bullshit, OK.

297
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,188
Doesn't matter, it's over.

298
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,069
So, what do you do, Julia?

299
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:53,115
Depends on how drunk I get.

300
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:59,121
I'm a PhD candidate in biology.

301
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,254
Oh, for real?

302
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:06,694
This is Gavin.
I'm basically his muse.

303
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:10,480
Kind of like, Amelia Fluga.

304
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:13,135
I don't know who that is.

305
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,225
I studied coil displays
in mammals.

306
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:20,316
Oh... well, I find that subject
very interesting.

307
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,363
Most men do.

308
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,104
I study fucking hyenas.

309
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,410
I mean, hyenas who are fucking,

310
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:29,804
and the females have a penis.

311
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:31,806
Which is a faux-phallus.

312
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:34,678
Say that three times fast.

313
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:36,811
Faux-phallus,
faux-phallus, faux-phallus.

314
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:41,032
You two should have
your own podcast.

315
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:44,427
Are you Gavin?

316
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:47,300
Have we met?

317
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:50,433
Is there something funny?

318
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:55,264
This... isn't funny.

319
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:59,268
You're not gonna
get very far with him that way.

320
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:03,142
Are you aware that there is smoking
happening in the common spaces?

321
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,145
- Oh, my God, the common spaces!
- Yes, yeah, the common space...

322
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:09,931
- The hallways, the staircases.
- Jesus-fucking-Christ, what's wrong with you?

323
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:11,759
No. No, no, Dunley vs. Barr.

324
00:19:11,802 --> 00:19:14,631
I... I'm sorry, what?

325
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,894
2005, civil court case,
New York State.

326
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:20,507
A private nuisance cause of complaint
can be brought by a tenant

327
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,509
against a landlord,
or another tenant,

328
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:24,424
for second-hand
smoke conditions inside--

329
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:28,210
This is a party.
This is a goddamn fucking party.

330
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:31,866
Have you never been
to a fucking party before?

331
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:35,870
Mm...

332
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:38,786
Perfect, Lana, can you
escort this gentlemen out?

333
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:40,483
OK, now I get it.

334
00:19:40,527 --> 00:19:43,530
You get your friends
to assault me in the street?

335
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:46,228
- Oh, my God.
- What kind of sick fucks are you?

336
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:48,274
I... I'm sorry,
what are you talking about?

337
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,276
Do you know this... person?

338
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,625
I kinda ran into him.

339
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:55,368
Listen...

340
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,021
I'm not turning down the music,

341
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:00,721
and I'm not ending
my fucking party early.

342
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:14,735
Your friend has thrown a party
every night this week.

343
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:16,476
She has people
pissing in the stairwells.

344
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,218
- It's disgusting.
- I totally get it.

345
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,220
Yeah, so what
are we gonna do about it?

346
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,178
Sabotage?

347
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,964
OK, the thing is, this is kind of
an important night for Charlie.

348
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,009
Oh...

349
00:20:28,052 --> 00:20:29,619
Oh, it's an important night.

350
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,839
Oh, well, then by all means,
let's piss everywhere.

351
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:33,449
Let's piss right here
in the kitchen right now.

352
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:34,537
I'm gonna take a piss.

353
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:37,671
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

354
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:45,896
Thank you even more for making tonight
such a huge success at the gallery.

355
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:50,031
But, most importantly,

356
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:52,207
I wanna thank you
for all the bad decisions

357
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,991
I know you're gonna make
later on tonight.

358
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:59,606
Oh, and the handgun
in the study...

359
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,217
No need for concern.

360
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,306
I would like to
direct your attention

361
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:08,441
to our very over-qualified
safety coordinator,

362
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,878
Lana Carter,
ladies and gentlemen.

363
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,581
Anyway, thank you all for being
upstanding and responsible citizens.

364
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:25,371
Oh, and, know this...

365
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:28,939
Be good... or be good at it.

366
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:30,027
Whoo!

367
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,203
Drinks, everybody.

368
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,469
Is that a joke?

369
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:39,080
The gun? No, she's serious.

370
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:40,647
What is wrong with you people?

371
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,040
It's art.
Charlie owns a gallery.

372
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,782
A loaded gun isn't art,
a loaded gun is dangerous.

373
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,349
Sorry I said anything.

374
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:48,829
You know how many people die
every year

375
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,657
- from things like that?
- God, you're still here?

376
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,267
It's like the bike thing
all over again.

377
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,269
- Are you always like this?
- No. No, no.

378
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,489
You can't turn this
around on me.

379
00:21:56,532 --> 00:21:59,405
I'm actually pretty cool guy.

380
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:01,711
Yeah, ask anybody.

381
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,933
Well, nobody here... obviously.

382
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:08,979
It's a party.

383
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:11,417
People dance, people drink,
people get loud.

384
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,420
- I can't believe you're actually making me defend this. 
- So, you agree with me?

385
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:18,859
No, I'm doing the exact
opposite of agreeing with you.

386
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:22,123
- People like you can have this city.
- What does that mean?

387
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,733
It means that
you all deserve each other.

388
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:25,344
You can be self-righteous
with all the other

389
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:27,128
world-class pricks
that can afford this town.

390
00:22:27,171 --> 00:22:30,218
Yeah, these narcissistic,
sycophantic, pretentious--

391
00:22:30,261 --> 00:22:32,481
Oh, my God,
you're a buzzword factory.

392
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:37,051
Is there something about me
you particularly hate?

393
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:38,574
Just go pick on someone else.

394
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:44,275
Hey, does that work for you?

395
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,668
Nagging?

396
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:48,018
I mean,
do you get chicks with that?

397
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:50,543
'Cause my friend, Ando,
you know, he swears by it.

398
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:53,502
He's practically scraping
the pussy off him, you know.

399
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:54,590
He's...

400
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:57,376
Cheers.

401
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,160
Oh, those shoes are hideous!

402
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:02,772
Hey, I'm Amesh.

403
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:06,254
Um, do you have a good dentist,
by any chance?

404
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:08,691
Get off.

405
00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:10,693
Get off!

406
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:12,216
I'm serious.

407
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,567
This thing's a custom bike.

408
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,352
Where's the helmet?

409
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:20,660
Where's the... helmet?

410
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:34,674
It's loud enough, OK.

411
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:36,980
Other people
live in the building.

412
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:46,425
Do you like the photos?

413
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:49,166
It looks like someone I know,
he's a DJ.

414
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:55,956
His family was evicted from the
apartment they lived in for 20 years,

415
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:58,654
by developers, so they could
build the Barclays Center.

416
00:24:00,787 --> 00:24:01,831
Hmm...

417
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,270
I saw Jay-Z there.

418
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,625
Shh...

419
00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:29,337
May I please...

420
00:24:31,426 --> 00:24:37,040
I'm asking in my nicest...
sweetest voice.

421
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:40,087
Please, hand my helmet back.

422
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,525
If you promise to stop
being no fun.

423
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:56,930
I promise...
to stop being no fun.

424
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:01,674
Hmm.

425
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,896
Excuse me.

426
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:14,600
You're welcome.

427
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:22,738
I got fired up
and your friend is a fucking...

428
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,308
I'm sorry.

429
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:30,790
I'm angry at the wrong person.

430
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:33,575
You're not the one treating me
like an asshole.

431
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:37,666
- You hit me with a car.
- Part of a car.

432
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:40,016
Fair enough.

433
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:47,894
Do you have something awful
to say about these, too?

434
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:51,593
You have the wrong idea
about me.

435
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,292
I like these.

436
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:57,381
What do you like about them?

437
00:25:57,425 --> 00:26:01,603
I don't know,
I'm not a critic, but there...

438
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:04,127
There's a humanity here.

439
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:06,956
They're real people.

440
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:10,438
It's what I was going for.

441
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,180
You took these?

442
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:14,964
You're a photographer.

443
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,096
Trying to be.

444
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:17,924
Well, clearly, you already are.

445
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:21,014
You can tell that to my boss.
I work at an ad agency.

446
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:23,364
As a receptionist.

447
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:26,585
It's not very glamorous,
but the pay is terrible, so...

448
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:30,197
What do you do?

449
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,459
Please, say something boring.

450
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,635
- I'm a firefighter.
- Really?

451
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:34,897
No.

452
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:39,336
No, I'm a data scientist.

453
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,514
Which means we use, um,
a bunch of collected data

454
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:47,997
to use to make
predictive formulas for, uh...

455
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,130
It's really way more
interesting than it sounds.

456
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:52,306
I hope so.

457
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:58,007
Now, we have to a figure out
a way to apologize.

458
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:02,359
Well, technically,
I already did, so...

459
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:04,318
Right, sorry, uh...

460
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:06,886
I'm sorry,
defensiveness runs in my family.

461
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,539
And my family has dementia.

462
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:12,631
Shit, you're serious.

463
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:17,548
- I'm Hollis.
- Oh, Lana.

464
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:20,029
I like your artwork, Lana.

465
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:23,076
I like your helmet, Hollis.

466
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,599
- You do?
- No, not really.

467
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,993
All right.

468
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:28,690
OK, yeah, there you are.

469
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:32,259
Um, can I borrow you
for a second?

470
00:27:37,394 --> 00:27:41,703
Hey, so, um... did you get a
chance to talk to Charlie?

471
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:43,879
I told her to talk to you.

472
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:46,360
I don't know,
why can't you just talk to her?

473
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:49,102
Fucking kidding me.

474
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,148
What's going on?

475
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,021
Look...

476
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:57,371
I just need 40 seconds
to tell her something.

477
00:27:57,414 --> 00:28:00,200
Can't...
Can't you do that for me?!

478
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:02,898
Sorry, sorry.

479
00:28:02,942 --> 00:28:05,248
I'm just...
Wait, wait, just wait a second.

480
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:08,861
- Wait a second, come here.
- You should just take things more seriously.

481
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:11,559
If something's wrong,
she'll listen,

482
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:12,821
you're her business partner.

483
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:16,520
Forget it.

484
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:23,527
Hey, OK, hold on.

485
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:25,486
This song depresses me.

486
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:26,879
Oh...

487
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:37,498
You like it?

488
00:28:43,983 --> 00:28:44,897
That's lovely.

489
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,463
Excuse me?

490
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:49,162
Your necklace.
It's beautiful.

491
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:52,948
It's Alexander Fandu.

492
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:56,430
I... have no idea who that is.

493
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:01,478
It's very expensive.

494
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:05,221
Yes, it is.

495
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:12,011
You know,
the thing about this piece is--

496
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:13,795
Do you have any coke?

497
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,840
Excuse me?

498
00:29:15,928 --> 00:29:19,148
Cocaine.
Do you have any?

499
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,891
No.

500
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:29,680
Lovely meeting you.

501
00:29:31,595 --> 00:29:33,380
Light?

502
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:34,860
What?

503
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:37,123
Do you have a light?

504
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,298
No.

505
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,606
Do you like the painting?

506
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:49,570
I like the colors.

507
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:51,006
They're very...

508
00:29:52,486 --> 00:29:53,792
big.

509
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,755
OK, I...

510
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:03,932
I, uh...

511
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:08,894
think that this painting
has a lot of colors

512
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:12,854
and some of them are green.

513
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,464
Some of them aren't.

514
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:17,903
And then this one
looks a lot like that one,

515
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:22,037
just turned upside down.

516
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:23,691
Which makes me feel...

517
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,388
Feel?

518
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:29,305
It makes you feel how?

519
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:36,922
Like, like, the artist... made
two and then turn one around.

520
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:40,186
I don't know... I'm trying.
I'm trying looking at it,

521
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:42,144
and I don't... I don't know.

522
00:30:42,188 --> 00:30:47,541
I'm trying. It's just sort of a...
thing on the wall.

523
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:53,590
A thing... on the wall.

524
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:58,204
This painting is by my husband.

525
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,208
He's dead.

526
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:07,735
At least he's dead to me.

527
00:31:08,823 --> 00:31:12,305
A thing... on a wall.

528
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:16,048
I like it.

529
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:27,668
Oh, hi. I don't know if
I've had a chance to--

530
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:30,801
You look like a nice girl, so, I'm
going to stop you right there.

531
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:35,110
If you mention that I'm pregnant
or that I'm glowing

532
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:38,635
or I'm the size of a small pony
or try to touch me,

533
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:41,160
I'll break that champagne bottle
over your head.

534
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:53,912
Would you think any less of me if
I asked you to make me a drink?

535
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:58,351
I don't know if I'm ready to
single-handedly brain damage a baby.

536
00:31:58,394 --> 00:32:01,093
His father's mostly
responsible for that.

537
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:04,487
Just let me hold it.

538
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,799
Are you serving booze
to a pregnant woman?

539
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:15,368
I appeal to her sense
of human decency.

540
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:16,412
Oh.

541
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:19,024
I didn't know
she had one of those.

542
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:21,896
Hey, I thought we were
starting over.

543
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,117
So, are you serving the drinks?

544
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,597
I don't know, you're the one
dressed like a bartender.

545
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:30,426
What...

546
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,254
Now you have a problem
with the way I'm dressed.

547
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:33,952
No, you should have
pride in your style.

548
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:35,997
It's rebellious bookishness.

549
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,825
- -No, you should
wear it with pride,

550
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:40,480
you're in a city of grown men
in children's clothing.

551
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:44,005
God, you two, just fuck
and get it over with already.

552
00:32:49,141 --> 00:32:50,751
She's drunk, she doesn't
know what she's saying.

553
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:52,492
Yeah.

554
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:56,148
- So, you're still here.
- I guess I am.

555
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:57,758
I'm as shocked as you are.

556
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:59,629
So, should I make you one?

557
00:33:00,761 --> 00:33:02,458
Are you asking me to stay?

558
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:06,941
This is the wine I brought.

559
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:10,249
Mm... wine product?

560
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,815
How bad can it be?

561
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:16,211
Mm...
Oh, God, that's terrible.

562
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:19,127
That's the last time
I buy wine at a bodega.

563
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:24,741
To Charlie,
may her party end early.

564
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:26,134
Yeah, I'll drink to that.

565
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:32,880
Oh, God.

566
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:34,795
You think they'll ever
get tired of that?

567
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:36,971
The view? No.

568
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:40,409
I think when you're down there
on the streets,

569
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,933
it's easy to forget
how great this place is.

570
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,502
You know, except for that
it's completely awful.

571
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,725
What do you think it was like
hundreds of years ago?

572
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:58,036
Do you ever try to imagine it
when it was just trees?

573
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,604
Bears, deer and bobcats.

574
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:04,955
Was your third animal a bobcat?

575
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:07,393
- Really?
- What do you want from me?

576
00:34:07,436 --> 00:34:08,655
It's freezing.

577
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:14,617
Can I ask you a question?

578
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:15,879
Yeah.

579
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,796
What's up with the helmet?

580
00:34:25,106 --> 00:34:26,673
Oh...

581
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:29,110
Uh, this is either a lady

582
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:32,809
or the daintiest man
in New York City.

583
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:36,074
- I have been looking for you.
- Oh, hey.

584
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:39,077
You haven't been
hiding from me now, have you?

585
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,035
Why would I be hiding from you?

586
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:44,604
Mm...

587
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:50,740
Uh...

588
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:53,874
Can I have my finger back?

589
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:57,051
Um...

590
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,141
Oh, wow, you are...

591
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,273
crazy.

592
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:04,406
But I'm the good crazy, right?

593
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,799
I guess so.

594
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:08,454
Tell me I'm the good crazy!

595
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:09,933
You're, um...

596
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:14,634
I'm just... joking.

597
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:18,028
Need help with that?

598
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:19,508
No, I got it.

599
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:21,119
Oh... oh!

600
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,557
Nice, very smooth.

601
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,475
How long have you
been taking photographs?

602
00:35:29,518 --> 00:35:33,522
Hmm... I had a little Polaroid
camera in grade school.

603
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:40,834
Taking pictures is the closest
I can get to...

604
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:45,230
I wanna know something.

605
00:35:45,273 --> 00:35:48,885
And...
know it without being told,

606
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:50,365
just know it in my heart.

607
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:55,588
What about you?

608
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:56,676
What about me?

609
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:59,766
What do you know, Hollis?

610
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:03,117
What do I know?

611
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,076
Uh, it's my job to know things.

612
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:10,994
Yeah, but that's different.

613
00:36:12,779 --> 00:36:14,215
You're using your head.

614
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:18,393
Do you ever just know?

615
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:29,012
What about that?

616
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:34,279
I think it's easy
with photographs.

617
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:36,106
I think it's the other stuff
that's hard,

618
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:39,588
it's the...
the abstract stuff that's...

619
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:41,286
over my head.

620
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:44,463
The thing is, it's all the same,
you're just trying...

621
00:36:44,506 --> 00:36:47,379
to uncover something
that's trying to get out.

622
00:36:50,338 --> 00:36:52,166
I mean, fuck if I know
what that thing's trying to say.

623
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:56,823
Hold this.
Give me that.

624
00:36:56,866 --> 00:36:58,868
- We're making art.
- Oh.

625
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,394
This is art, right?

626
00:37:02,437 --> 00:37:04,831
- You know--
- Oh, that's art.

627
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:07,007
OK, smile. Come on. please.

628
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,922
Can you smile?
Wait, don't smile.

629
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:10,489
It's more artistic
when you don't smile.

630
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:12,665
It's perfect.

631
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:22,283
Do you think this painting is
worth more or less than my life?

632
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:25,155
- One-hundred percent more.
- Wait, 100 percent more?

633
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:26,374
It's worth double my life?

634
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:27,854
- Take your life...
- Mm-hmm

635
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:29,856
- add it by one more life.
- Double its value?

636
00:37:29,899 --> 00:37:32,032
So, $30?

637
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:35,253
Obviously worth less than...

638
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,515
Everything OK?

639
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:41,259
Yeah, um, can you get us
something decent to drink?

640
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:43,435
Yeah... sure, what do you want?

641
00:37:43,478 --> 00:37:45,350
Oh... over there.

642
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:47,003
You want something
from over here?

643
00:37:47,047 --> 00:37:50,050
- Yeah, mm-hmm.
- OK, what do you want?

644
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:51,573
Surprise me.

645
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:11,854
Charlie...

646
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:13,116
Charlie.

647
00:38:18,948 --> 00:38:21,908
Could you stop being crazy?

648
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:24,258
Why is Adrian here?

649
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,522
I don't control
his comings and goings.

650
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:30,569
Oh, my God, it's you two.

651
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:31,961
Oh, my God, no!

652
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:33,528
And not for lack of him trying.

653
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:35,182
That's not what he says.

654
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:37,010
What?

655
00:38:37,053 --> 00:38:38,403
Well, he's a liar!

656
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:41,014
Look, he's coming over here,

657
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:42,058
could you just...

658
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:43,451
Text me when Ellen gets here.

659
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:44,800
Why don't you
just be less awkward?

660
00:38:44,844 --> 00:38:47,194
Where are you going?

661
00:38:47,237 --> 00:38:49,501
And who's that boy?

662
00:38:49,544 --> 00:38:51,372
I'm just going
to use the bathroom.

663
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:55,028
Now you are talking my language.

664
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:57,030
Isn't she cute?

665
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:59,206
Talented, young.

666
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:05,255
- Charlie, great show tonight.
- Hi.

667
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:06,474
Adrian.

668
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:08,650
So, you a fan of Feesbot's work?

669
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:10,913
Uh, I haven't seen it,
I didn't go,

670
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,393
but I heard a lot about it.

671
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:14,439
That's the important part.

672
00:39:14,482 --> 00:39:16,179
You know, for you, I mean.

673
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:19,748
Yeah, of course.

674
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:22,142
You should think about us
doing some business together.

675
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:24,710
You know what, I'm not looking
for a new business partner.

676
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:30,716
Dennis isn't a business
partner, he's a liability.

677
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:32,413
You know,
the thing about us is,

678
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:34,807
well, we don't even
have to have sex.

679
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:37,070
But I think we should.

680
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:43,424
Lana's right,
you're the fucking worst.

681
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,003
"Vulva, sad dick,

682
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:59,135
monster,
big dick...

683
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:01,007
bitch tits."

684
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:11,887
You're no fun.

685
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:14,194
I thought you were gonna be fun.

686
00:40:14,237 --> 00:40:16,762
Be fun!

687
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,983
What's his name?

688
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:25,988
The boy? The boy we're
avoiding, his name?

689
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:31,472
Adrian.

690
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:36,608
Oh... really?

691
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:39,872
So, did you fuck him
or you don't wanna fuck him?

692
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:44,442
If you're avoiding a boy,
it's because you fucked him,

693
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:46,835
or it's because
you don't wanna fuck him.

694
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:52,450
We made out once.

695
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:54,974
A little.

696
00:40:56,845 --> 00:40:59,239
Disastrous, Lana.

697
00:41:00,849 --> 00:41:02,155
Sweetheart...

698
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:06,464
what are you doing here?

699
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:08,814
You don't do drugs,
you hardly drink,

700
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:11,512
and you're avoiding
all the boys.

701
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:19,477
Honestly, Julia,
I have no fucking idea.

702
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:22,697
Someone's in here.

703
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:23,829
Lana?

704
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,572
- Oh, it's a boy!
- It's a different boy.

705
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:29,704
Oh, how many boys are there?

706
00:41:29,748 --> 00:41:31,793
Go get him.

707
00:41:31,837 --> 00:41:33,578
- Lana?
- Yeah?

708
00:41:35,188 --> 00:41:37,538
You throwing a private party
in there?

709
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:39,497
No, no, just give us a second.

710
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:44,719
- I--
- Listen, I...

711
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:47,113
- Sorry, go ahead.
- No, no, you go.

712
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:50,159
If I did something--

713
00:41:50,203 --> 00:41:52,988
No, no, you didn't do
anything wrong, trust me.

714
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:59,691
Uh, just give me a second, and then we
can go back to having fun, I promise.

715
00:41:59,734 --> 00:42:01,562
OK.

716
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:05,871
I'm gonna go talk to some people
and try not to be an asshole.

717
00:42:05,914 --> 00:42:09,439
- Try being charming.
- Charming. Hold on, let write that down.

718
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:11,529
I heard that.

719
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:19,537
I'm sorry about this, I just wasn't
planning on meeting anyone tonight.

720
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,365
Any one interesting, I mean...

721
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:25,368
That was the wrong way
of saying that, I...

722
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:27,327
I don't really know
what I'm trying to say.

723
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:30,852
I'm just really glad
that you're still here.

724
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:36,510
Now would be a really great time
for you to say something.

725
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:39,905
Hollis?

726
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:42,995
Hollis?

727
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:49,131
Disastrous, Lana.

728
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,318
How many is that for you?

729
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:06,148
Mm... one less than enough.

730
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:10,370
I don't wanna be here all night.

731
00:43:10,413 --> 00:43:12,154
Why not?

732
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:17,203
Oh, you're not enjoying this
impressive wasting of resources?

733
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:20,989
I told Diana
we'd be home hours ago.

734
00:43:24,427 --> 00:43:26,995
I need you to go
talk to Charlie.

735
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:29,650
- I told you, I'll talk to Charlie--
- You told me

736
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:31,826
you'd stand up to her
if you have to.

737
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,872
Now, you have to.

738
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:39,791
Have your drink,

739
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:44,534
go and tell her
and let's go home.

740
00:43:47,494 --> 00:43:48,887
This is my business, too.

741
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,193
So, let's be done
with this already.

742
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:08,689
Lana, you look like hell.

743
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:11,387
Your ass is looking fantastic though,
there's nothing wrong with that.

744
00:44:11,431 --> 00:44:13,912
Stop trying to be disgusting,
Adrian.

745
00:44:13,955 --> 00:44:17,698
It's a compliment, Lana. You got
pretty eyes and a fantastic ass.

746
00:44:17,742 --> 00:44:20,092
- I'm gonna pretend like--
- I get it. I get it.

747
00:44:20,135 --> 00:44:21,833
Let's go get some oysters.

748
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,878
- Adrian--
- We can talk about your career, I know people.

749
00:44:23,922 --> 00:44:26,011
So, you wanna get
business oysters?

750
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:31,016
Look, I can't take you seriously,
if you don't take me seriously.

751
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:33,105
I am being serious.

752
00:44:33,148 --> 00:44:34,759
Even if you don't wanna
see me anymore.

753
00:44:34,802 --> 00:44:36,630
I'm not seeing you now.

754
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,414
Mm.

755
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,765
Adrian, we have to establish
some ground rules

756
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:43,202
because, clearly, we're going
to be seeing each other.

757
00:44:43,245 --> 00:44:45,552
- In bed?
- At events.

758
00:44:45,595 --> 00:44:48,511
Lana, we've got chemistry,
you've gotta admit that.

759
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:51,645
All right, what's his name?

760
00:44:53,212 --> 00:44:55,910
- Whose name?
- The guy... that you're blowing me off for.

761
00:44:55,954 --> 00:44:58,391
My life doesn't
revolve around men.

762
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:01,307
And since you have to know, and let's
be completely clear about this,

763
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,396
it's none of your business.

764
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:04,876
I'm meeting Alan Paloma.

765
00:45:04,919 --> 00:45:07,052
What?

766
00:45:10,185 --> 00:45:11,447
You're serious?

767
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:15,800
Alan's not coming to this party,
are you crazy?

768
00:45:15,843 --> 00:45:17,105
Charlie set it up.

769
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:19,760
Alan hates Charlie.

770
00:45:19,804 --> 00:45:22,807
Charlie hates Alan.
Alan steals Charlie's artists.

771
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,810
Charlie would never
let the man in this building.

772
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:31,424
You gotta smarten up, buttercup.

773
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:45,873
I saw the helmet.

774
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:47,788
J'adore.

775
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:49,834
I love it.

776
00:45:51,357 --> 00:45:53,620
What do you think of this piece?

777
00:45:53,663 --> 00:45:56,797
What do you think it symbolizes?

778
00:45:58,103 --> 00:46:01,280
A monument to the penis, maybe?

779
00:46:10,332 --> 00:46:12,813
Hi... bunny rabbit.

780
00:46:12,857 --> 00:46:15,990
You look like a bunny rabbit.

781
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:17,209
I don't like it
when you're scared,

782
00:46:17,252 --> 00:46:20,255
I like it
when you're happy, Lana.

783
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:21,779
OK, whoa, all right.

784
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:26,566
Why did you lie to me?

785
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:28,437
I don't lie.

786
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:31,397
Alan's not coming, is he?

787
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,356
You know, what bothers me is that you
knew how badly I wanted to meet him.

788
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,054
What makes you think
he's not coming?

789
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:37,403
You and Alan hate each other.

790
00:46:37,446 --> 00:46:40,623
Do I strike you
as the hating type?

791
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:43,975
- Adrian said that you--
- Listen...

792
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:45,803
Adrian is a liar.

793
00:46:45,846 --> 00:46:48,240
Why would you believe
anything that man says?

794
00:46:48,283 --> 00:46:50,024
You asked me to help.

795
00:46:50,068 --> 00:46:52,853
This... this is how I can help.

796
00:46:52,897 --> 00:46:56,248
Yet, now you're making me feel
like you're doing me a favor.

797
00:46:58,076 --> 00:47:00,426
This is how
the world works, sweetie.

798
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:02,254
So, get with the program.

799
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:06,693
People like fun people,
so, be fun.

800
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:10,001
I'm fun.

801
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,962
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna give this to you

802
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:17,704
and assume you know
what to do with it.

803
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:47,185
I think for my next project,

804
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:49,361
I'm gonna do
a motorized unicycle.

805
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:54,192
Lana... have you met Sasha?

806
00:48:54,235 --> 00:48:58,587
Sasha makes
artisanal motorcycles.

807
00:48:58,631 --> 00:49:00,415
Handmade.

808
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:01,764
Wooden.

809
00:49:01,808 --> 00:49:03,766
They have a top speed of, um...

810
00:49:04,854 --> 00:49:05,986
Twenty-five miles an hour?

811
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,683
I'm trying to get it up to 30.

812
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:10,077
It was so nice to meet you,

813
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:12,819
can you excuse us
for just a second.

814
00:49:12,862 --> 00:49:16,605
Apparently, and I wanna make sure
that I get the phrasing right,

815
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:20,827
there is a substantial chance
of them catching on fire.

816
00:49:21,915 --> 00:49:23,308
OK, I get it.

817
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:27,399
And, also, the starting price
is only $85,000,

818
00:49:27,442 --> 00:49:29,618
which is nice.
It's reasonable.

819
00:49:29,662 --> 00:49:31,272
You're the worst.

820
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:34,493
Are we good?

821
00:49:34,536 --> 00:49:37,409
Yeah, yeah, um...

822
00:49:37,452 --> 00:49:39,541
I thought this party
was gonna be one thing

823
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:41,979
and it turned out to be
a total fucking other thing,

824
00:49:42,022 --> 00:49:44,068
but, um, I...

825
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:46,418
It was weird for a minute,
but I'm better now.

826
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:51,205
Now, it's your turn.

827
00:49:51,249 --> 00:49:53,512
OK, um...

828
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:56,602
I thought that I would be
sleeping right now...

829
00:49:56,645 --> 00:50:00,127
but instead of sleeping, like, directly above us,

830
00:50:00,171 --> 00:50:04,044
I am here,
learning about motorcycles

831
00:50:04,088 --> 00:50:06,438
made out of various woods.

832
00:50:06,481 --> 00:50:07,917
- More than one?
- More than one.

833
00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:09,702
Yeah, pine for the handle bars

834
00:50:09,745 --> 00:50:12,096
because it's softer, but...

835
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:14,011
Hey, hi...

836
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:17,884
Hey.

837
00:50:19,146 --> 00:50:21,105
Oh, uh, yeah, hello?

838
00:50:21,148 --> 00:50:24,108
Yeah, yeah, this is Dr. Bakshu.

839
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:27,241
Yeah, yeah, I was wondering, uh, I
wanted to get some detailing done

840
00:50:27,285 --> 00:50:30,070
on my new Porsche.

841
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:31,767
I'm getting some
work done on my Porsche.

842
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:33,639
- It's a...
- Brother.

843
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:35,771
- Huh?
- They're gay.

844
00:50:35,815 --> 00:50:36,772
What?

845
00:50:36,816 --> 00:50:38,470
They're gay.

846
00:50:38,513 --> 00:50:40,037
They don't look gay.

847
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,213
OK, they're not,
but they're not into you.

848
00:50:42,256 --> 00:50:45,085
But... that one in purple
was kinda into me.

849
00:50:45,129 --> 00:50:47,305
I'm just gonna go check it out.

850
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:49,524
You ain't got no Porsche,
do you?

851
00:50:49,568 --> 00:50:50,612
- Yeah, I do.
- You do?

852
00:50:50,656 --> 00:50:52,266
- Yeah.
- What year?

853
00:50:53,441 --> 00:50:55,095
I live in Park Slope.

854
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:56,488
Fucking parking would kill me.

855
00:50:56,531 --> 00:50:59,621
But, you know,
I got the key chains off eBay.

856
00:50:59,665 --> 00:51:01,406
- It's about eight bucks.
- Dude, are you serious?

857
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:05,062
Yeah, it was $8.99, you know,
it was nine bucks.

858
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:07,760
I don't get
what she sees in you.

859
00:51:07,803 --> 00:51:09,327
Who?

860
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:10,850
Me.

861
00:51:10,893 --> 00:51:13,592
- Oh. Hey.
- I have been looking for you.

862
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:17,117
Yeah, you know, I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

863
00:51:17,161 --> 00:51:18,945
- Why's that?
- Uh, because...

864
00:51:18,988 --> 00:51:20,599
Because I'd be, like,
"I'm about to pee in my pants,"

865
00:51:20,642 --> 00:51:22,601
- so, it's...
- Oh, come on,

866
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:23,558
we'll take care of that.

867
00:51:23,602 --> 00:51:24,777
- OK.
- Coming?

868
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,083
- I can go by myself.
- Nope.

869
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:30,870
Ah...

870
00:51:32,045 --> 00:51:33,220
Oh, yeah.

871
00:51:35,788 --> 00:51:37,920
Want some?

872
00:51:37,964 --> 00:51:39,661
Ah...

873
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:41,924
Come here.

874
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:47,104
- Inhale.
- I don't know... OK.

875
00:51:50,368 --> 00:51:52,021
I don't feel anything.

876
00:51:52,065 --> 00:51:53,632
You know, why do people do this?

877
00:51:53,675 --> 00:51:54,937
Boredom.

878
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:56,243
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Inhale.

879
00:51:59,464 --> 00:52:01,335
Oh, shit.

880
00:52:01,379 --> 00:52:04,860
OK, OK, um...

881
00:52:04,904 --> 00:52:06,775
I feel it.

882
00:52:06,819 --> 00:52:09,038
- Shut up.
- I... What?

883
00:52:16,263 --> 00:52:18,178
No... hold on... hold...
Oh, no.

884
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,269
There... there's a baby in here.

885
00:52:22,313 --> 00:52:24,663
Oh, I know
there's a baby in here.

886
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:28,014
Yeah, let's put a baby in here.

887
00:52:28,057 --> 00:52:29,668
I don't... I don't really wanna
put a baby in there.

888
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:33,280
Shh...
You're so fun to fuck with.

889
00:52:33,324 --> 00:52:36,762
- OK.
- Let's take these off.

890
00:52:36,805 --> 00:52:39,156
- You know, I am feeling a little--
- Shh...

891
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,940
Shut up!

892
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:42,724
No, no, I can't do this!
I can't do it!

893
00:52:42,768 --> 00:52:46,293
Stop! The baby's right there.
The baby's watching...

894
00:52:46,337 --> 00:52:48,687
The baby's watching...

895
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:52,169
Fuck, why am I so attracted
to nervous men?

896
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:55,172
Did you...
did you close the door?

897
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:57,391
Oh, I don't care if they watch.

898
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,264
- Yeah, but...
- Come on!

899
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:12,189
Don't mind me.

900
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:18,020
Oh, come on, Amesh, relax.

901
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:19,283
OK.

902
00:53:19,326 --> 00:53:20,501
Smile.

903
00:53:22,111 --> 00:53:25,027
I can't do this...
I can't.

904
00:53:25,071 --> 00:53:26,203
Oh, excuse me.

905
00:53:27,726 --> 00:53:29,858
Nice friends you have here,
Charlie.

906
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:34,254
Meet me in the study.

907
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,785
- Nice ass.
- Thank you.

908
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:46,005
Close the door.

909
00:53:48,137 --> 00:53:49,443
You talk.

910
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:51,445
You listen.

911
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:54,753
- Dennis, you know--
- You listen.

912
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:57,973
- Pam, what the fuck?
- Listen!

913
00:53:58,017 --> 00:54:00,193
OK, pregnant lady,
I'm listening.

914
00:54:04,763 --> 00:54:06,025
We're going out of business.

915
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,030
By March, we won't make payroll.

916
00:54:11,073 --> 00:54:12,684
You're fucking crazy, Dennis.

917
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:16,122
- We represent Matthew Davis.
- Davis left.

918
00:54:16,165 --> 00:54:19,256
You would know that if you spent a
little more time at the gallery.

919
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:20,605
Feesbot's leaving, too.

920
00:54:20,648 --> 00:54:23,042
- Bullshit.
- Well, they got a better offer.

921
00:54:23,085 --> 00:54:25,218
Then match it.

922
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,219
How?

923
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:31,485
Getting them to stay
is your job.

924
00:54:31,529 --> 00:54:33,705
I throw the parties,
I get the press,

925
00:54:33,748 --> 00:54:35,315
that is how
it has always worked.

926
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:37,361
You see, Charlie,
that's the thing...

927
00:54:38,449 --> 00:54:40,059
it's never worked!

928
00:54:41,234 --> 00:54:43,105
You see, we need sales, right,

929
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:45,020
not magazine clippings.

930
00:54:46,718 --> 00:54:48,372
So, what?

931
00:54:48,415 --> 00:54:51,766
We're done, we're finished,
it's over, like...

932
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,333
No...

933
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,509
I'm done.

934
00:54:55,553 --> 00:54:58,817
You and me... we're done.

935
00:55:04,779 --> 00:55:07,695
Sure, fine.

936
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:10,481
But you're not taking my art.

937
00:55:12,744 --> 00:55:16,617
You know,
that's the thing, Charlie,

938
00:55:16,661 --> 00:55:19,141
none of this is your art!

939
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:23,363
Yes, that's the thing,

940
00:55:23,407 --> 00:55:26,061
it is, all of it is mine.

941
00:55:26,105 --> 00:55:31,371
And you, you're nothing.

942
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:32,720
Bye-bye.

943
00:55:38,813 --> 00:55:40,075
You don't get it.

944
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:46,778
Goodbye, Dennis.

945
00:55:50,912 --> 00:55:53,306
I want you to be honest.

946
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,612
Are you kidding me?

947
00:55:54,655 --> 00:55:56,657
I don't wanna
wait until you get here,

948
00:55:56,701 --> 00:55:59,399
I want to know right now.

949
00:56:07,538 --> 00:56:08,756
OK.

950
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:12,107
Well, then at least promise me

951
00:56:12,151 --> 00:56:16,068
we can discuss it face-to-face
because you owe me that.

952
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:19,637
If nothing else,
you owe me that.

953
00:56:47,752 --> 00:56:50,929
There are so many dishonorable
people in this world.

954
00:57:08,163 --> 00:57:09,382
Ow!

955
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,254
I don't work for you.

956
00:57:21,263 --> 00:57:22,439
Dammit.

957
00:57:25,311 --> 00:57:27,487
Hey, Lana.

958
00:57:27,531 --> 00:57:30,272
I was just here thinking about
you, and then... you walk in.

959
00:57:30,316 --> 00:57:31,622
Serendipitous.

960
00:57:31,665 --> 00:57:33,624
It's not that big
of an apartment.

961
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:36,278
You know,
I don't take it personally

962
00:57:36,322 --> 00:57:39,543
when you don't return
my text messages.

963
00:57:39,586 --> 00:57:41,022
Maybe you should.

964
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:42,241
I get it.

965
00:57:42,284 --> 00:57:43,851
I intimidate you.

966
00:57:43,895 --> 00:57:47,159
- No, you don't.
- Of course, I do.

967
00:57:49,335 --> 00:57:53,295
Look, you can't humiliate me
in front of these people.

968
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:56,516
The only one
humiliating you is you.

969
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:57,517
Look...

970
00:58:00,085 --> 00:58:01,913
I'm sorry.

971
00:58:01,956 --> 00:58:04,393
This is not the conversation
I wanted to have.

972
00:58:04,437 --> 00:58:06,178
Then let's not, OK.

973
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:11,139
You know, we used to hang out
and just... just talk.

974
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:13,533
Adrian, that was before
I knew you.

975
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:24,675
We're running dangerously low
on champagne.

976
00:58:24,718 --> 00:58:26,938
What is this, Charlie?

977
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:28,896
You're bleeding,
show me your mouth.

978
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:33,074
Hmm...

979
00:58:33,118 --> 00:58:34,467
Come on.

980
00:58:39,211 --> 00:58:40,473
Hey, you all right?

981
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,127
I'm being followed
by a crazy person.

982
00:58:42,170 --> 00:58:44,346
- Ignore him.
- Ignore him?

983
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,653
Yeah, just ignore him, he's only
trying to make things weird.

984
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:48,568
Make what weird,
how could it possibly--?

985
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:50,570
Lana, I'm disappointed in you.

986
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:54,095
I was at least expecting
someone with some taste.

987
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:57,925
Do you wanna bother
telling me what happened?

988
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:01,102
Artistic disagreement.

989
00:59:05,672 --> 00:59:07,195
Ow! Fuck!

990
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,850
I'll take that as a no.

991
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:16,988
Remember that old guy,
the one from Pegasus?

992
00:59:17,031 --> 00:59:19,251
I was telling him about
my one-man-show

993
00:59:19,294 --> 00:59:22,210
and he said I should come up
and do it for him sometime.

994
00:59:22,254 --> 00:59:23,864
Yeah, he's the real deal.

995
00:59:23,908 --> 00:59:26,606
I might actually
get to do this show.

996
00:59:29,174 --> 00:59:30,567
What?

997
00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:34,483
Don't, please.

998
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,137
Who the fuck are you?

999
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:38,313
Adrian.

1000
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:40,533
- Who the fuck am I?
- Hollis.

1001
00:59:42,491 --> 00:59:47,061
It's just, you know,
this whole one-man-show-thing.

1002
00:59:50,543 --> 00:59:54,503
I really don't care.

1003
00:59:57,898 --> 01:00:00,422
It's that easy for you, huh?

1004
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:01,641
Hmm?

1005
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:06,298
I really cared about you,
did you know that?

1006
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:11,608
And now you don't have to.

1007
01:00:12,826 --> 01:00:14,306
Lucky you.

1008
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:27,362
Why don't we just
get out of here? Huh?

1009
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:29,016
Who the fuck is this guy?

1010
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,018
- Does anyone here know?
- Do you wanna go?

1011
01:00:31,062 --> 01:00:33,542
Who the fuck are you? What
the fuck have you ever done?

1012
01:00:33,586 --> 01:00:34,805
Gavin?

1013
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:37,634
Gavin!

1014
01:00:38,765 --> 01:00:40,419
You...

1015
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:43,378
- I'm sorry about--
- Shut up.

1016
01:00:43,422 --> 01:00:45,598
You wanna leave?

1017
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,688
No, I'm not going anywhere,
I'm here for a reason.

1018
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:50,995
Sorry, chum, the girl's spoken.

1019
01:00:51,038 --> 01:00:52,692
You're not the reason!

1020
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:54,955
Stop telling people
we slept together!

1021
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:56,914
Lana, hey, hold up, listen.

1022
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:58,872
I thought we were supposed to
help each other, right?

1023
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:01,701
Look, go back to your apartment,
Hollis, this is lame.

1024
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:03,572
I don't want any of this,
this isn't me.

1025
01:01:03,616 --> 01:01:05,662
It's not me either.

1026
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:07,664
Well, then it's too bad
this is where we met.

1027
01:01:10,928 --> 01:01:13,365
I get it, Charlie, you win.

1028
01:01:13,408 --> 01:01:14,671
What are you talking about?

1029
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:15,889
You got me to stay all night.

1030
01:01:15,933 --> 01:01:19,197
It sucked, but I stayed,
so, you win.

1031
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:21,155
You think I lied to you
just to get you

1032
01:01:21,199 --> 01:01:23,114
to come to one of my parties?

1033
01:01:23,157 --> 01:01:25,725
Who the fuck do you
think you are, Lana?

1034
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:27,161
There's a million of you.

1035
01:01:27,205 --> 01:01:30,338
Oh, and he's here, by the way.

1036
01:01:30,382 --> 01:01:33,254
And the first thing he did
was ask about you.

1037
01:01:33,298 --> 01:01:34,647
He's in the bedroom.

1038
01:01:35,866 --> 01:01:38,259
Believe me, don't believe me.
Stay, go.

1039
01:01:38,303 --> 01:01:40,697
Do whatever you want,
I don't fucking care anymore.

1040
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:46,354
Mr. Paloma?

1041
01:01:47,399 --> 01:01:49,880
Feesbot is here.

1042
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:52,970
Go ahead, ask them yourself.

1043
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:54,798
Good luck, Charlie.

1044
01:01:54,841 --> 01:01:56,451
I don't need luck.

1045
01:02:01,587 --> 01:02:03,632
Thank you...

1046
01:02:03,676 --> 01:02:05,504
all for coming.

1047
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:08,986
We are Feesbot.

1048
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:16,558
And we are here to celebrate!

1049
01:02:20,911 --> 01:02:26,743
Tonight has been
a tremendous success for art.

1050
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:29,180
And for all of you.

1051
01:02:29,223 --> 01:02:30,659
For us.

1052
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:33,967
We wanna thank Charlie Kenner

1053
01:02:34,011 --> 01:02:35,969
for all that she has
done for us.

1054
01:02:36,013 --> 01:02:38,406
But, there comes a time,

1055
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,104
on every adventure,

1056
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:42,367
when you need to go on your own.

1057
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:47,198
And soon...
we will be announcing...

1058
01:02:47,241 --> 01:02:50,592
our new venture.

1059
01:02:50,636 --> 01:02:53,944
Feesbot is going international.

1060
01:02:58,818 --> 01:03:01,995
We have been honored to be
represented by Charlie Kenner.

1061
01:03:02,039 --> 01:03:05,607
But, it is time
for Feesbot to go it alone.

1062
01:03:05,651 --> 01:03:08,349
And we hope you come with us...

1063
01:03:08,393 --> 01:03:10,482
On a new adventure.

1064
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:13,615
But, tonight, we celebrate!

1065
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:19,056
To Charlie!

1066
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:21,101
To Feesbot!

1067
01:03:25,845 --> 01:03:27,499
Lana?

1068
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:38,640
Ah...

1069
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:43,167
Charlie told me
you might've left.

1070
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:46,735
I was about to shove off myself.

1071
01:03:46,779 --> 01:03:48,999
Parties really aren't my thing.

1072
01:03:49,042 --> 01:03:51,697
- Mr. Paloma, I'm so--
- Nope.

1073
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:53,873
It's Alan.

1074
01:04:02,534 --> 01:04:04,841
- It's hash.
- No, thank you.

1075
01:04:07,365 --> 01:04:08,409
No?

1076
01:04:10,063 --> 01:04:11,586
Suit yourself.

1077
01:04:29,953 --> 01:04:31,868
Don't take it personally.

1078
01:04:35,175 --> 01:04:36,873
Screw you.

1079
01:04:48,754 --> 01:04:49,842
So...

1080
01:04:51,278 --> 01:04:53,324
about that offer.

1081
01:04:55,282 --> 01:04:58,503
I've always known
you were a scumbag, Adrian.

1082
01:04:58,546 --> 01:05:01,375
But you are
a consistent scumbag.

1083
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:07,294
It's the only thing
I appreciate about you.

1084
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:11,429
Tough night?

1085
01:05:13,387 --> 01:05:17,957
I've been...
sort of waiting for you.

1086
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:19,393
I'm flattered.

1087
01:05:20,699 --> 01:05:22,875
And I love your work.

1088
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:27,271
- I really love your work.
- Thanks.

1089
01:05:27,314 --> 01:05:29,316
It's hard to come by, you know.

1090
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:32,580
Real talent.

1091
01:05:34,713 --> 01:05:36,541
Most people don't have it.

1092
01:05:36,584 --> 01:05:40,762
And those that do,
don't know what to do with it.

1093
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:52,296
That's where I come in.

1094
01:05:54,298 --> 01:05:55,734
Now, I'm the first to admit it,

1095
01:05:55,777 --> 01:05:58,302
there's nothing special
about me.

1096
01:05:58,345 --> 01:06:02,306
I'm just a simple Brooklyn boy
in an expensive jacket.

1097
01:06:02,349 --> 01:06:04,351
I suck at math.

1098
01:06:04,395 --> 01:06:07,876
Can't remember a birthday
to save my life.

1099
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:10,444
But I have an eye.

1100
01:06:12,055 --> 01:06:16,276
And over the years,
people have come to respect it.

1101
01:06:17,451 --> 01:06:19,540
And I've learned to use it.

1102
01:06:21,325 --> 01:06:24,850
And I want you to use it.

1103
01:06:26,852 --> 01:06:28,723
Use what?

1104
01:06:28,767 --> 01:06:31,422
My respect.

1105
01:06:31,465 --> 01:06:34,294
Now, I don't know
if you want to be rich,

1106
01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:37,428
or famous, or fuck actors.

1107
01:06:37,471 --> 01:06:39,299
Well, I wanna make a difference.

1108
01:06:39,343 --> 01:06:40,474
So do I.

1109
01:06:42,955 --> 01:06:46,393
Only a sociopath doesn't wanna
make a difference.

1110
01:07:06,848 --> 01:07:09,721
I can be a great partner to you.

1111
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:17,903
But...

1112
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:23,256
partnerships...

1113
01:07:24,866 --> 01:07:28,348
are a two-way street.

1114
01:07:54,244 --> 01:07:56,420
They're not very good, are they?

1115
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:01,860
You can tell me the truth.

1116
01:08:04,384 --> 01:08:06,778
- God, I'm such an idiot.
- Lana, I can't--

1117
01:08:06,821 --> 01:08:09,172
I actually don't want you
to say anything right now.

1118
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:14,786
Sorry...

1119
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:18,877
Come upstairs with me.

1120
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:23,577
- For what?
- So we cannot be in this place.

1121
01:08:24,883 --> 01:08:28,452
I know a much calmer apartment
in the building.

1122
01:08:28,495 --> 01:08:30,454
OK, nothing like that,

1123
01:08:30,497 --> 01:08:31,977
I don't mean it like that,
I just...

1124
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:37,287
You were right about this place.

1125
01:08:48,211 --> 01:08:50,822
Uh, all right, well, uh...

1126
01:08:50,865 --> 01:08:53,216
We have
an announcement ourselves.

1127
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:56,915
Adrian Tyler Media is proud
to announce a new partnership

1128
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:59,439
in the likes of which New York
has never seen.

1129
01:09:02,921 --> 01:09:04,749
Is everybody having a good time?

1130
01:09:04,792 --> 01:09:07,317
I'm just asking
because it's my party,

1131
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:11,495
and I wanna make sure that you are all
having a fan-fucking-tastic time.

1132
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,194
Oops...

1133
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:19,285
I guess our security officer
made a little mistake.

1134
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:22,245
Anyway, tonight, we are here
for Feesbot, right?

1135
01:09:22,288 --> 01:09:24,072
Everybody, round of applause.

1136
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,729
Many of you
probably don't know this,

1137
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:29,817
but I found these two idiots

1138
01:09:29,861 --> 01:09:31,210
dancing in lines for nightclubs

1139
01:09:31,254 --> 01:09:34,605
that they could never get into.

1140
01:09:34,648 --> 01:09:37,434
You want me to make you
really famous?

1141
01:09:39,827 --> 01:09:41,829
'Cause that's what
you want, right?

1142
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:45,920
I mean, to be recognized,
to be noticed.

1143
01:09:45,964 --> 01:09:48,096
It's why you're here.

1144
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,489
It's why you're all here.

1145
01:09:50,882 --> 01:09:52,188
It's why she's here.

1146
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:54,886
I have no fucking idea
why he is here.

1147
01:09:54,929 --> 01:09:56,975
That bitch is fucking crazy.

1148
01:10:04,939 --> 01:10:06,202
Let me show you something.

1149
01:10:07,464 --> 01:10:10,554
You see this... thing?

1150
01:10:10,597 --> 01:10:14,166
It could pay the rent in your
shitty apartments for a year.

1151
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:20,825
And now it's worth even more...

1152
01:10:20,868 --> 01:10:22,392
because of me.

1153
01:10:23,741 --> 01:10:25,482
Oh, you guys can all
just go fuck yourselves,

1154
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:28,789
you don't even
deserve my attention.

1155
01:10:28,833 --> 01:10:29,964
Give it to me.

1156
01:10:31,879 --> 01:10:33,141
No!

1157
01:10:45,284 --> 01:10:48,809
I'm sorry, but the look on your
face right now is hysterical.

1158
01:10:50,637 --> 01:10:53,597
You didn't do it, did you?

1159
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,121
- Do what?
- Fuck him.

1160
01:10:56,164 --> 01:10:59,080
Oh, Jesus Christ, Lana.

1161
01:10:59,124 --> 01:11:03,520
Nobody gets anything out of Alan-fucking-Paloma
without fucking Alan Paloma, I...

1162
01:11:03,563 --> 01:11:07,175
You thought I wanted you
to connect me with Alan Paloma

1163
01:11:07,219 --> 01:11:09,787
so that I could
fuck him for a show?

1164
01:11:11,658 --> 01:11:14,531
I don't fuck people
to get ahead, Charlie.

1165
01:11:15,793 --> 01:11:17,838
And that's why
you'll never get ahead.

1166
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:39,904
Lana...

1167
01:11:39,947 --> 01:11:42,210
Hey, Lana.
Lana, wait up.

1168
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:53,787
Lana!

1169
01:11:53,831 --> 01:11:55,049
Hey, Lana, wait.

1170
01:11:57,965 --> 01:11:59,184
How much?

1171
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,145
How much for one of your prints?

1172
01:12:04,189 --> 01:12:05,321
I wanna buy one.

1173
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:09,237
Tell you what,
I'll give you one.

1174
01:12:18,725 --> 01:12:19,857
God, I'm out of shape.

1175
01:12:20,901 --> 01:12:22,860
If only you had a bike.

1176
01:12:24,905 --> 01:12:26,690
If only I had your number.

1177
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,096
Goodnight, Hollis.
