1
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,871
Being at Home with Claude.

2
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,919
You don't think that I would prefer to be at
home watching television...

3
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,875
...and not with a fag
who slits peoples throats?

4
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,392
You think that I don't have anything better
to do in life?

5
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,720
After the park
Where were you?

6
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,273
- I have already told you twelve times!
- Repeat it to me.

7
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,759
I Will say it again for the last time! Tape it, film it.
Put a liner on the mark.

8
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,198
Are you in charge of this or him?

9
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,993
Already full!

10
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,437
- Kid, I advise you...
- Don't call me kid!

11
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,117
You called me and I came.
You have told me your absurd story.

12
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,034
Now fulfill that promise and allow me to do my work.

13
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,629
Tell me everything!

14
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,874
But I have told you everything. How much more
do you want to know?

15
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,477
Your name.
- I won't tell you.

16
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,309
Begin.

17
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,113
After the park...
- From the beginning.

18
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,878
Yes?

19
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,437
Excuse me.

20
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,713
The judge says that it will arrive within an hour.

21
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,353
Very well... very well,talk!

22
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,360
Come on.

23
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,400
After leaving the house I took the metro.

24
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,110
Had to be nine o'clock.

25
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,435
Went as far as Bonaventure.

26
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,911
Came out and I started to walk to the harbour.

27
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,150
When I arrived I went west. I was walking
for an hour.

28
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,196
When I woke up...
When I awoke I was sitting at the look-out in Westmount.

29
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,633
My head hurt...

30
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,634
...like when you fall asleep
in the bath.

31
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,120
You fall asleep but you know that
you are in the bath.

32
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,396
The dream is similar.

33
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,676
Suddenly, I woke up at the look-out...

34
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,681
I was dreaming and
at the same time didn't know it.

35
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,515
I went walking. That's everything!

36
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,556
Stop hallucinating.
We only have one hour. Talk.

37
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,273
But what confession am I making?

38
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,871
I didn't cut his throat...

39
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,111
for money
or because he bothered me.

40
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,997
Why then?

41
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,956
I was walking but I didn't know why.

42
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,872
I Knew why I was Walking
but didn't want to think about it.

43
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,877
What were you thinking of?

44
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,594
Other times it happened that way.

45
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,393
When?

46
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,353
Other times when I felt...

47
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,118
When I felt very wasted.

48
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,433
I liked to go for long walks.

49
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,720
I felt wasted and couldn't sleep.

50
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,952
You were sitting at the lookout... And...?

51
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,760
- I was afraid.
- Of what?

52
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,589
Of what you were afraid?

53
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,874
If you were afraid,
why did you call us?

54
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,510
Why didn't you disappear?

55
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,678
Why did you call the police and say...

56
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,071
there was a corpse
in a house on Casgrain Street?

57
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,473
Why did you call an hour later
to confess to the crime?

58
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,797
If you are afraid,
why tell us where you are...

59
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,520
to force us to come?

60
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,399
How did you get Judge Delarme's keys?

61
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,398
Why demand that we come here?

62
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,074
Why call the newspaper?

63
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,119
Why don't you want to tell us your name?

64
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,236
Go on.

65
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,193
When I woke up I didn't believe it.

66
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,596
The same as when you are
with somebody...

67
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,594
You think that you have already
lived that moment.

68
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,159
That you have told that person...

69
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,872
and that you have already
dreamt that you have told him.

70
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,395
The other one is not sure.

71
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,076
As if it were the same thing.

72
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,993
I had walked more than one hour...

73
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,079
I was sitting at the lookout...

74
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,797
and meanwhile I remembered something
I wasn't sure I had done

75
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,673
and then waking up
thinking it was impossible.

76
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,756
Could not be...

77
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,879
Can't you get him out of here?

78
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,272
Why?

79
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,671
He listens to everything, doesn't speak,
doesn't make a noise.

80
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,074
And if he speaks, you don't listen
to him anyway.

81
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,076
If he leaves will you tell me your name
and why you killed him?

82
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,513
Tell me what we're doing here?

83
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,911
And tell me how
to get it without a scandal.

84
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,311
Bring me another coffee, Guy.

85
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,191
- Do you want one?
- No, thank you.

86
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,358
The bar to the side it should be open.

87
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,359
Go and wait outside until I call you.

88
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,276
Something new?

89
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,470
Nothing at the moment. Maybe later.

90
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,311
I felt a fresh breeze and
I had a feeling it was going to rain.

91
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,560
I no longer new in what street I was.

92
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,991
Anyway, next to the one on Sherbrooke.

93
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,918
I was heading to the mountain when I stopped.

94
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,356
For what reason?

95
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,079
What do you think is done on the mountain
at night in the month of July?

96
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,596
- I must know.
- Don't make fun of me?

97
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,716
- Come clean about it.
- Fucking.

98
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,031
Satisfied?

99
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,278
Why the hell do you wanna
go fuck on the mountain...

100
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,279
only one and a half hour after
you killed the guy?

101
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,192
Why did you call us?

102
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,280
- I didn't call.
- Then what am I here for?

103
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,153
- Not immediately.
I called two days later after...

104
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,471
After what?

105
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,313
- After him.
Before... I called him.

106
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,430
- Who?
You won't tell us his name either?

107
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,677
Why did you call him
if you knew that he was dead?

108
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,832
- I wasn't sure.
- How's didn't you know?

109
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,480
I thought that it had been a dream.

110
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,475
- You believed that it had been a dream
and you called him.

111
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,194
- Not right away.
- Then when?

112
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,800
I was sitting at the lookout...

113
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,759
I was looking at the houses...
I like the houses in Westmount.

114
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,039
I always dreamt of being rich.

115
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,914
My father was rich when he was a kid

116
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,992
and he told me stories
of when he was rich.

117
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,671
My grandparents used
to tell me stories about that too.

118
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,359
Christmas, Easter...
when they had parties at home.

119
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,674
A room full of Louis XIV furniture.

120
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,038
My grandfather built the house.

121
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,193
He sold it to my great-grandfather
after losing his fortune.

122
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,273
Then they moved to the second floor.
It looked like the cave of Alí Babá.

123
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,440
They had lots of of things...

124
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,115
silverware, paintings and china...

125
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,996
Westmont?

126
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,199
Yes. They lived in Westmount
when they were rich.

127
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,116
You were at the lookout in Westmount.

128
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,550
As I was looking at the houses.

129
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,639
People were watching television.

130
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,756
Why did you call his house?

131
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,036
The guy...

132
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,874
- Hey!
- What?

133
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,238
Can't say his name.

134
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,629
- What?
- His name!

135
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,191
- You called him.
- Yes.

136
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,840
And later?

137
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,070
I told you a thousand times.
I took a walk.

138
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,878
Caught the metro.

139
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,431
Yes, I caught the metro
and I walked to the lookout!

140
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,834
I woke up. And I looked at
the houses of the rich.

141
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,476
The image that had been in my
head seemed impossible.

142
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,630
I started to run.

143
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,956
I ran down the hill like a madman
all the way to the forum.

144
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,677
Ran like a lunatic...

145
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,076
as if I could prevent a catastrophe.

146
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,799
- Until the Fórum...
- Yes.

147
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,954
What did the street look
like where you stopped?

148
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,073
- Was it straight or curved?
- I don't understand...

149
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,400
Tell me about the street,
not the houses!

150
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,080
It was on a hill with a circle at the top.

151
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,039
The cars going by had to turn right.

152
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,119
Uphill?

153
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,794
- Were you above Sherbrooke?
- Yes.

154
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,514
You said cars went by.

155
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,754
I remember a white Mercedes
going by slowly.

156
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,159
The guy was looking for an address.

157
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,959
Did traffic go up and down hill bothways?

158
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,873
He went up, but it was two-way.

159
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,117
Landsdown.

160
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,518
Never mind.

161
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,314
Then?

162
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,037
- I ran to the Fórum.
- All the way?

163
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,350
- A good distance.
- It can be.

164
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,636
- Always running?
- Yes.

165
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,758
- How many blocks?
- I dunno!

166
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,593
- Were you running along Sherbrooke?
- I guess.

167
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,631
Yes or no?

168
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,955
What difference does it make that I ran...

169
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,158
along Sherbrooke or St. Catherines?

170
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,715
It does. So answer.

171
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,312
Look at me in the eyes!

172
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,600
Now listen. It's Monday morning.
I got here at 1a. m. Sunday.

173
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,037
You called to get us here and...

174
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,759
you promised those reporters a scoop.

175
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,116
You told them some shit was
gonna hit the fan

176
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,031
at the courthouse - but it's
you whose in the shit!

177
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,636
And it's my turn to push.

178
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,030
You called us about a body in a
flat on Gasgrain

179
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,478
then called back to say you did it,

180
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,277
that you were here and to hurry.

181
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,909
cause the papers were on the way, right?

182
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,191
Yeah?

183
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,839
I'll get your coffee.

184
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,199
Your birthday's coming up.

185
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,910
How did you know that?

186
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,552
Yves. Beautiful name.

187
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,718
Does your sister know you hustle?

188
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,715
Take us for idiots while
you jerk us around

189
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,393
and turn the city inside out?

190
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,753
Washing your dirty laundry

191
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,879
while we try to find out your name?

192
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,995
I'm not jerking you, I'm here.

193
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,636
So what do you want?

194
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,439
The autopsy says that he died July 1st

195
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,319
between 9 and 11 p. m.

196
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,076
You called us the night of the 3rd.

197
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,518
What did you do in between?

198
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,075
I'm telling you.

199
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,629
Shut up and let me talk.

200
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,833
I want to know where you went.

201
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,759
I want to know why you killed him?

202
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,517
Who you are, where you come from
and what you do?

203
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,550
All I get out of you is garbage
and I have a feeling

204
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,833
that for 36 hours you've
been laughing in our faces.

205
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,199
I hate that. Do you understand it?
I hate that!

206
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,639
Question: last name?
Answer: won't tell.

207
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,680
Question: first name?
Answer: won't tell.

208
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,797
Age? No answer.
None of your business

209
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,079
I killed him. Ain't the enough?
So kiss my ass!

210
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,319
How'd you get in here?

211
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,319
Answer: It's your job to find out.

212
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,792
Question: What do you do?

213
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,560
Answer: I fuck.

214
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,191
For money? Answer: It's a living
ain't it?

215
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,271
Question: Where do you hang out?

216
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,116
In the park at the fountain?
He doesn't respond.

217
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,830
Now we see it's Portuguese Square.

218
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,514
Fuck! That's not laughing at us?

219
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,273
Who cares where I'm from?

220
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,320
Won't tell us his name.
Think we're jerks?

221
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,874
It's all in the apartment-

222
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,278
his passport, lease, medicare card.

223
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,399
Think we'd just quietly pick him up

224
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,036
scrub the floor and lock the door?

225
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,755
Think you're James Bond?

226
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,915
Just what are you up to?

227
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,512
You have no criminal record.

228
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,877
How do you know?

229
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,313
Don't leave a cup with your prints
where a cop can get it

230
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,119
if you don't want us checking
prints, you moron.

231
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,029
He didn't have drugs or alcohol
in his blood,

232
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,914
but he died fucking a guy.

233
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,635
Wasn't raped because he came too.

234
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,590
Clothes all over the place...

235
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,591
but nothing was torn.

236
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,400
Your fingerprints everywhere...

237
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,918
'cept on the steak knife that killed him

238
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,351
cause you can't lift prints of
a wooden handle.

239
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,273
Some of your johns say your okay...

240
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,593
maybe a bit reckless at times.

241
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,555
Others aren't so complimentary.

242
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,030
You don't know any of my johns.

243
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,236
Next time you don't kill a literature student

244
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,517
who writes everyday in his diary

245
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,595
how weird it is to sleep with a pro.

246
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,717
And when you tell the cops to meet
you in a Judge's office

247
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,151
in the middle of the night, on a weekend

248
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,951
with 250,000 tourists in town for
the Jazz Festival,

249
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,837
don't leave your jean jacket hanging around

250
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,749
with AVAILABLE written on it in deglo.

251
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,430
How long did you know him?

252
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,031
Why did you slit his throat in the kitchen?

253
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,472
Isn't that in his diary?

254
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,036
He hardly talks about sex.

255
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,515
"cept that it's been nearly a month.

256
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,279
One month?

257
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,272
Yes. For a month he mentions you
on every page.

258
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,870
Are you surprised?
- No...

259
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,752
Let us begin again and make it quick.

260
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,195
Your name's Yves. His was Claude.

261
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,511
On Thursday July 1st, you left the Square

262
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,440
between 6:30 and 7 o'clock.

263
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,156
Nobody knows why.
There were lots of johns.

264
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,713
Maybe you were on a call.
Nobody saw you after midnight.

265
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,476
You were seen at the Lorelei...

266
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,553
and the Bull and in the Rocambole.

267
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,680
You wouldn't speak to anybody.

268
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,836
They thought you'd struck it rich
or you'd drop acid or mescaline.

269
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,149
You were so hyper they thought that
you'd lift off into the air.

270
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,231
Then you went back to the square.
It started to rain.

271
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,830
No one knows if you scored or not.

272
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,639
You said you did twice.

273
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,271
You vanished until Saturday night.

274
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,831
Regular lays - not a client, but another pro

275
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,800
tried to call you 20 times but you didn't
answer.

276
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,193
He dropped by your house on Saturday
but nobody answered.

277
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,718
He had no idea where you were
and he had never heard of him...

278
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,279
Claude!... Nobody ever heard of him.

279
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,440
Saturday at 11:30...

280
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,475
someone called the police to report

281
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,758
a body at 8574 Casgrain.

282
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,356
We arrive to find a guy naked

283
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,354
on the kitchen floor,
with his throat slit.

284
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,792
Two plates on the table, a $15 bottle of wine

285
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,555
and spaghetti with blood covering it,

286
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,837
blood splattered everywhere.

287
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,597
The lab says the spaghetti was
cold when the blood hit it.

288
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,236
He was 22 years old from Ste-Foy.

289
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,233
Came here 2 years ago and lived alone.

290
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,996
Studied literature at the
University of Montreal.

291
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,111
Was a member of the PQ.

292
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,915
His girlfriend works for them.
She almost fainted when we visited her.

293
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,480
- His what?
- His girlfriend.

294
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,914
Liar! You're stringing me along.

295
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,993
That's your game.

296
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,597
Want to speak?
Let's finish this in my office.

297
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,154
It's not true, can't be!

298
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,631
Lotsa guys have girlfriends.

299
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,390
We have his prints and those of two others.

300
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,870
Yours and the girlfriend's.

301
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,994
She said, "Tell the guy who did
this that he's a sick bastard. "

302
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,756
I won't disagree with her and
you'd better not.

303
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,756
Got your prints off the coffee we ordered.

304
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,079
- What's her name?
- Who?

305
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,831
The girl!

306
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,229
You don't ask the questions,

307
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,836
you answer them.
Starting from now on.

308
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,231
So shut your big mouth.

309
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,039
- Her name!
- Shut up!

310
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,037
So you didn't know him well enough
to know he had a girlfriend?

311
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,437
At 12:45 a. m. the same person

312
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,837
calls about the body. That's you.

313
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,590
You say you're in Judge Delome's office

314
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,952
that you killed him
and you'll wait for us here

315
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,236
and don't try to get you out by force

316
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,551
because you've called some hack at
the newspaper

317
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,353
who'll not leak anything if we play clean.

318
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,676
But if anything happens, the Judge is sunk.

319
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,636
All we know is you got the key
and got in here

320
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,437
and if we try to muzzle the reporter
or photographer

321
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,435
you'll scream police brutality.

322
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,992
Timings great with all those tourists in town.
Thought of this yourself?

323
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,271
We've got until 5 o'clock

324
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,273
to feed them a story.

325
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,240
The front page for today is already full

326
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,633
but they need something juicy
for tomorrow morning.

327
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,717
A judge is really tempting.
Your sense of timing is great.

328
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,312
Just what is it you're after?

329
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,040
Why not ask the judge?

330
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,353
Say that again and I'll unscrew your head!

331
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,598
Can't figure out why
you've put us in this mess.

332
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,797
Can't figure out why you wanted to
rub out that schoolboy.

333
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,518
Good looking. Educated.

334
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,309
What was he doing with
an asshole like you?

335
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,037
He didn't do drugs. Didn't cruise.
Drank $15 bottles of wine.

336
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,832
The neighbors were stunned when they
saw him being wheeled out into the ambulance.

337
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,351
What were you doing Canada Day with
a guy like that

338
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,671
who used to cook 3 meals a week

339
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,471
for the old lady downstairs?

340
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,839
We know you'd being seeing him for a month.

341
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,239
But we don't know why.

342
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,994
And that after the 1st...

343
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,519
after June the first...

344
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,599
he writes about Yves on every page.

345
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,031
- You said every page.
- Who gives a damn?

346
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,234
Was he writing a book about you?

347
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,949
When we asked his girl if he slept with men

348
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,995
she screamed so hard like her jaw
was gonna come unhinged.

349
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,992
We didn't dare ask her more.

350
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,673
Latreille! He needs to pee.

351
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,876
No I...
- Get out!

352
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,471
Dial 9 for a line out?
- Yeah, that's right.

353
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:11,717
Hello? Hello...
How are you? Yes...

354
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,640
Who told you? Dupras?

355
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,031
I don't Know.

356
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,839
Will you be home for supper?

357
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,834
I don't know how long this will take.
I'll know by 5 or so.

358
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,079
What is it?
- I already told you.

359
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,910
Are there any complications?
- No, nothing's wrong.

360
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,312
Are you sure?
- Yes.

361
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,672
Give me the number there
so that I can locate you.

362
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,956
Don't call. I'll call before
leaving if I can.

363
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,074
Why you don't give me the number?

364
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,632
I'm not able to.
- Why?

365
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,111
You have to go through an operator.

366
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,953
You're not in Montreal?
- Yes, what do you think?

367
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,871
Sure everything is okay?
- Yes, don't worry.

368
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,916
Call Duprain or his assistant
if you need anything.

369
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,955
He will find me.

370
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,155
See you later.
- A kiss.

371
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,597
Why did you rip out your
doorbell and phone?

372
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,110
I didn't want anyone to bother me.
- I don't doubt it. But why?

373
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,633
Did it when you got home?
- No.

374
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,639
When, then?
- On Friday morning.

375
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,155
Friday, what time?
- I don't remember!

376
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,834
Why don't you remember?
- It's all a blur.

377
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,590
You think so.
- I woke up around 9 o'clock.

378
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,917
When did you return?
- At 5 thirty or 6.

379
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,275
Came home directly?
- What do you mean?

380
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,599
Didn't you stop to eat?
- I wasn't hungry.

381
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,159
Wasn't Hungry. Did you go back crusing?
- Yes.

382
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,311
Why didn't your john drive you home?
Was it the first time with him?

383
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,192
Not with him.

384
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,517
After he comes he's always ashamed.

385
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,753
He gets angry. Throws me money
and kicks me out.

386
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,356
How long did it take you to walk home?
- About 15 minutes.

387
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,676
Were you tired?
- No, but I had a headache.

388
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,156
Walk quickly?
- No.

389
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,030
15 minutes to your house?
Where does he live? Won't tell?

390
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,000
I got home at 5:30. It had rained
and the air felt fresh.

391
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,550
The sky was clear and the
air felt so cool.

392
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,239
Did you go to bed at once?
- Yes.

393
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,833
Were you stoned?
- Why do you ask me that?

394
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,957
Just answer!
- No I wasn't stoned!

395
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,316
Did you fall asleep at once?
- No!

396
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,674
When did you fall asleep?
- Maybe a half hour later.

397
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,277
And did you wake up at 9 o'clock?
- Maybe 9:30. I didn't notice.

398
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,917
My clock is ahead and I'm not
always sure what time it is...

399
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,801
so I look at the hands and take a guess.

400
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,430
Okay, so you woke up between
9 and 9:30 maybe.

401
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,479
Is that 9a. m.?
- Yes.

402
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,516
Sure?
- Yes!

403
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,672
And the day before at what time?
- At noon.

404
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,521
So from noon on Thursday to 6a. m. on Friday

405
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,120
I'm talking to you!

406
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,798
What?

407
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,514
Did you sleep between noon...

408
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,719
and 6a. m. on Friday?

409
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,153
Hardly any.

410
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,637
Meaning?
- No, I didn't sleep!

411
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,832
So you couldn't sleep when you went
to bed a 6 o'clock?

412
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,800
Yes, it happens to me a lot in summer.
The light doesn't allow me to fall asleep.

413
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,238
Try smoking a joint?
- Sometimes. But not that morning!

414
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,472
Why?
- Because I didn't want to.

415
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,070
I washed my face and I went to bed.

416
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,231
That's everything?
- Yes.

417
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,071
No, I read a little.
- What?

418
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,113
A book that a friend lent me.

419
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,871
But I was too tired. So I left it
and I counted sheep.

420
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,755
And then you fell asleep?
- Yes. It didn't take long.

421
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,072
What's the book about?
Do you remember the title?

422
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,596
I told you I was too tired to read!

423
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,439
And you woke up at 9 o'clock.
- Yes.

424
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,589
Not long for a guy too tired to read
at 7 o'clock.

425
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,309
Did the phone ring?

426
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,994
I told you I just woke up!

427
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,193
Yeah, but you didn't say you'd
ripped out the phone

428
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,717
and no one could reach you because
you'd also ripped out the doorbell.

429
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,560
I woke up with a stomach ache.

430
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,069
What kind of pain?

431
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,278
Like I had a metal bar in me

432
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,799
and it hurt real bad. Guess I rolled over

433
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,958
and it hurt so bad, I woke up.

434
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,356
I felt more tired than
when I had gone to bed.

435
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,876
I didn't know why, I was drooling
and felt very sick.

436
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,719
I couldn't concentrate on anything.

437
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,919
I had all these images floating in my head.
But I'm not crazy!

438
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,439
Don't get angry. I didn't say anything.

439
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,080
But you'd grab at any reason
to tell those reporters I'm crazy.

440
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,636
what else?
- I can't think anymore, I'm tired!

441
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,559
Does your stomach still hurt?
- It's okay.

442
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,196
So you pulled out the phone again
when you woke up?

443
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,678
No. I went to bed again and fell asleep
and had the same dream.

444
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,119
But I just got more tired.
I woke up moaning.

445
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,076
How come?

446
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,311
It's difficult to explain.

447
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,916
I woke up but didn't know...

448
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,761
if I'd woken up before and if
I was dreaming or not.

449
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,238
My stomach hurt me more and more.

450
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,040
I couldn't take it so I called him.

451
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,919
Who?
- Him!

452
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,710
And then...?

453
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,441
...and then?
- Then nothing.

454
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,154
I slept again, got up

455
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,278
and went to bed again...

456
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,153
until Saturday night.
- What time?

457
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,914
I don't know. The clock had stopped.

458
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,993
I didn't even know it was Saturday.

459
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,757
Didn't know. Didn't give a shit!

460
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,470
But you'd noticed the clock had stopped?

461
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,234
Only around 11 o'clock.

462
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,749
You didn't go out all that time?

463
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,070
And on Saturday night?
- No.

464
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,833
Didn't you eat?
- At my place.

465
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,191
Yesterday you told us
that you never eat in your house.

466
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,675
Maybe I found something to eat.

467
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,231
But your refrigerator is empty

468
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,950
and there's nothing in your garbage
but kleenex and a few torn newspapers.

469
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,278
I told you I didn't eat because
my stomach hurt!

470
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,874
Was it from the drugs?
- No.

471
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,192
What made you sick?
- I dunno.

472
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:31,110
And at 11 o'clock?
- I had to leave.

473
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,399
I took a shower, I went for a hotdog
and I called to you.

474
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,034
Then the reporter at home and at work.

475
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,553
Came here, met the reporter

476
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,396
and the photographer

477
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,756
and then I called to you again.

478
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,150
You had the reporter's home number?
- Yes.

479
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,478
How is that?
- Can't say.

480
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,831
Gave you his office number too?

481
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,436
Maybe I looked it up.
I do know how to read.

482
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,552
Why don't you want a lawyer?
- I don't need one.

483
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,998
Who said the judge can bury this?

484
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:01,314
I didn't.
- Nah. Just that you'd killed a guy

485
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,357
and you wouldn't leave here
until the judge arrived

486
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,231
and the reporters are your security.

487
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,150
And that doesn't stink of blackmail, huh?

488
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,950
Why do you have to fit all the pieces
together? I said I did it.

489
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,833
What more do you need?

490
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,560
You that dumb?
- Ask the judge.

491
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,475
I've heard some crazy stories, but this...

492
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,791
a guy with no link to the victim

493
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,396
instead of keeping quiet

494
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,712
he blackmails a judge to get him off

495
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,159
after he's surrendered!

496
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,075
Doesn't give his
or the dead guy's name

497
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,550
and won't tell us why he did it.

498
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,838
So which one of us is crazy?

499
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,600
I'm suppose to start a vacation tonight
so let's go over it again.

500
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,914
Not again!
- Let's hear it.

501
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,073
You left the house at...
- Nine!

502
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,710
Where'd you go later?
- I caught the metro to Bonaventure.

503
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,038
Walked until I reached Westmount!

504
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,430
Then what?
- I started to run!

505
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,796
Where?
- To the Forum!

506
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,430
At 10:30p. m. on Canada Day?

507
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,995
To phone!

508
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,710
You ran all the way to call from the Forum

509
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:08,517
when you must have passed 40 booths?

510
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,395
Yes. No. I dunno anymore!

511
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,316
I's true. Doesn't make sense now

512
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,160
but it did then.

513
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,596
You were at the Forum, and then?
- But it was closed.

514
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,235
I called his place from a booth.

515
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,429
No answer.
I hung up and called again.

516
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,040
What number?
- You know.

517
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,875
I walked along Saint Cathereines

518
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,400
there were lots of people
shouting and waving flags.

519
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,634
It felt like after a good film.

520
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,794
I didn't want to walk cause
I'll forget the images in my head.

521
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,154
But I imagined it was a police movie
I was in. Remembering the worse scene.

522
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,718
So I did what I always do after a film,

523
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,713
I walked towards the Square

524
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,636
where I had first met him.

525
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,437
So you met him. Great! So you knew him?
- Yes!

526
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,239
Finally! When'd you meet him,
the night before June 1st?

527
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,792
I didn't want to stay at the Bull
for the parade.

528
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,073
What parade?

529
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,398
Just before closing,
when everyone washes up in the can

530
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,071
and then lines up at the doors so
they won't see anyone leaving alone.

531
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,512
I call it the parade.

532
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,039
I didn't want to watch it that night.

533
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,596
Didn't feel like going home to bed.

534
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,714
C'mon Claude, move your ass!

535
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,119
Like the merchandise?

536
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,400
Why don't you come with me?
I'll show you a good time!

537
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,712
Sit down.

538
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,599
Guess you know Montreal, huh?

539
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,396
What do you want to know?

540
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,160
Where to go on weekends.
I am from Quebec, so...

541
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,233
The Park of Mount Royale.

542
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,239
Then I went back to the square.

543
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,672
I knew something would happen.

544
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,316
Didn't know what but...

545
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,952
I felt I had to go back.

546
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,998
Anyway, there in the bedroom...

547
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,194
...with him.

548
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,915
I knew I couldn't be a chicken anymore.

549
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,833
Stop staring at me.

550
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,513
I think when you went to
see him on Thursday night

551
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,600
you were stoned. Completely ripped.

552
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,196
You got into a fight because
he's a rich kid from Quebec

553
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,990
and you do the square for money
and Westmount for kicks.

554
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,796
I think you got into a fight
and you went berserk

555
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,912
cause he wanted to dump you.

556
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,195
Killed him, didn't know what you were doing.

557
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,039
Went home to hide in your house

558
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,032
and when you came down you were scared.

559
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,359
Scared shitless.

560
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,397
You figure you can get away with
it by pretending your crazy

561
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,078
and calling the newspaper,
stealing the judge's keys...

562
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,000
where'd you get them?

563
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,120
Let me guess. From his pants?

564
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,392
Great way to blackmail a trick, huh?

565
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,755
Take them before or after
killing your friend?

566
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,110
After.

567
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,152
The judge can't call the cops

568
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,557
cause you figure if he does he's crooked.

569
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,672
So you call him and say,
"Either you hush this up

570
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:01,075
or I call the press and show
them the keys. "

571
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,875
Was that your plan?
- No.

572
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,559
No! No what?
Will you fuckin' tell me?

573
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,757
I've been doing this for 30 years,
see 10, 15 kids a day like you,

574
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,118
some do it to pay for school

575
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,154
and others cause there hooked
on drugs or booze.

576
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,193
Some do it cause there hungry

577
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,719
and some for kicks. There's many types.

578
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,196
I've seen them all. Short and tall, fat and skinny.
50 year olds who'd scare the hell out of you.

579
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,756
Some nights I wake up in a sweat
and think I can smell them.

580
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,510
Life is hard and some fools
have few oppurtunities.

581
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,519
So spit it out!
Skip the profound speeches

582
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:45,520
and your ideas on the topic.

583
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:48,237
They don't impress me anyway.

584
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,514
I'll tell you another thing.

585
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,634
Something I haven't told anyone

586
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,638
Sometimes, sitting behind my office desk,
facing them...

587
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,153
I look at them and feel like crying.

588
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:14,159
Sometimes, if Guy didn't write it down

589
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,951
I wouldn't remember what they'd said
up to 10 minutes at a time.

590
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,912
Takes all I've got to get from standing up

591
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,396
kicking Guy out,
and taking them in my arms.

592
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,597
I've seen a lot of kids. Every type.

593
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,630
But I hope to never see another one like you
in my goddamn life! Do you hear me?

594
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,510
cause I've never seen anything
as disgusting as you!

595
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,190
Don't think I won't wreck your little scheme.

596
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,238
But I will if it's the last thing I do.

597
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,910
Il prove you stole those keys

598
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,079
even if I have to lie to protect the judge.

599
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,837
Not because he's a pal or I stand to gain

600
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,390
or even because I'm worried about my ass.

601
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,878
But to shut you up

602
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,995
and take you out of circulation.
I'm willing to do anything.

603
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,432
Hear me? Anything!

604
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,599
But I'm gonna get you.
You can count on it!

605
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,671
Let's try this for starters.

606
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,632
The reporters will never see you.

607
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,153
Guy! Guy!

608
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,269
Send the reporters down the hall.

609
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,352
Wait!

610
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,634
Have the judge use the back door.

611
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,277
Make sure the photographer doesn't
see him and then come back here.

612
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,911
It may not work. I'm too tired to think.

613
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,270
But Ill find something,
believe you me!

614
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,032
I was stoned.

615
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:11,637
Worse still. I was in love.

616
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,071
Never felt so lousy in my life...

617
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,559
never felt so lost.

618
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,912
I called him to say I
was coming to see him.

619
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,152
I'd had a good day and
wanted to invite him to dinner.

620
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,750
Nothing fancy. Just to eat at the
Saint Denis or Chez Gabrielle.

621
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,836
Then go home and make love.

622
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,950
"Recharging my batteries" I called it.

623
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,038
After laying in his arms
nothing bad could happen to me.

624
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:08,556
Yeah, you're right.

625
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,439
He was a rich kid and
I worked the square.

626
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,240
But he never mentioned it.

627
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:22,750
It's true I often went cruising
after being with him.

628
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,712
I'm addicted. Do you understand that?

629
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,156
Can you understand?

630
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,192
You can, but you don't want to.

631
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,113
If you did you couldn't
go on doing your job.

632
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,759
You see, I understand too.

633
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,673
It's true that husting and cruising and
being in love is all the same thing.

634
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,552
It's just not easy for people to understand.

635
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,390
Using your ass is like using your head.

636
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,149
Some people were born to watch TV

637
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,360
others write

638
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,833
and it's beautiful.
They're never laughed at.

639
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,352
Fuckin's the same. It's a gift.

640
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,396
You've got it or you don't.

641
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:17,194
Me. I like it anyway it comes.

642
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,999
Hustling's a job

643
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,481
and don't want most johns
to even touch me.

644
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:27,191
Others, I want. Never asked myself
why some and not others.

645
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,671
It's not because they're the richest
or even the most handsome.

646
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,272
With some I won't get undressed. Others
I spend the night with. Same price.

647
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,519
But they're clients. I never forget the bill

648
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,273
no matter how nice they are.

649
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:52,997
The mountain is different.
I'm the one who choses.

650
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,000
I can change my mind and stop.

651
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,513
It's outdoors. Just before
dawn the birds start to sing

652
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,833
and it's beautiful. Such tranquility.

653
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,112
It's quiet and almost no one is around

654
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,160
and those who are hurry

655
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,717
for that one last bang before dawn.

656
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,716
The trails are empty.
I don't think about what will happen next.

657
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,311
But we're all looking for the same thing:

658
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,358
a bit of fun with someone,

659
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,795
to have some pleasure without
anything in exchange.

660
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,675
Sometimes at the square if
I've made enough money

661
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,838
and it's early, around 1

662
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,639
even if I'm stoned

663
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,680
I go there and walk, making up stories.

664
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:49,156
Cowboy movies, sometimes Robin Hood

665
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,876
and sometimes war movies.

666
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:54,193
I'm behind enemy lines, the last survivor

667
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,998
I walk without making a sound

668
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,199
and nobody sees or hears me.

669
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,274
Sometimes it's a horror film.

670
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,077
I lean against a tree

671
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,200
and let it run, 'till the bad part ends.

672
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,992
Usually the picture...

673
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,757
It didn't bother him that I hustled.

674
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,557
He understood and didn't
mind me talking about it.

675
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,677
Sometimes, with him, just before falling asleep

676
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,318
when I'd ask him to kill me,
to end it all,

677
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,913
he'd take me in his arms

678
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,917
and hug me as tight as he could, going...

679
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,634
I stopped asking him that

680
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,437
cause sometimes it made him cry.

681
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,920
I couldn't take that.

682
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,312
A guy who's coming, any guy

683
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:13,151
even if he's ugly - it's so beautiful.

684
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,390
But him even more so.

685
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,436
It was like our first sunrise.

686
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,111
I hate it when a guy cries.
Don't know what to do.

687
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,556
But him, when it was because of
me, it was unbearable.

688
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,593
I'd wished I'd never been born.

689
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,989
He'd tell me stories, all kinds...

690
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,960
Little Red Riding Hood,
Hansel and Gretel...

691
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,713
his voice was like I dunno...

692
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,351
just right.

693
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,072
With that voice he could tell me
the recipe for a carrot cake.

694
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:01,594
Once read me a book... "Claudel. "

695
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,760
It was lying by the bed.

696
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,750
He said, "wait I'll read you something. "

697
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,792
He pulled away his arm,
"can't read like this. "

698
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,072
I was lying on him and

699
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,596
he rolled me over, put the book on me
while looking for a page.

700
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,277
When he found it, he leaned to kiss me,

701
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,471
"Goodnight. "

702
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,995
Picked up the book, leaned over
to kiss me again, and said

703
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,274
"My love. "

704
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,316
Then he started to read to me again.

705
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,159
I don't remember what he read, but

706
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,317
it was the only time I
fell asleep on by back.

707
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,197
As if I were in a mattress floating on a lake.

708
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,560
He lent me the book.

709
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,196
I couldn't get past the part
he had read to me.

710
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,319
At one point the phone rang.

711
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:02,200
Some friends of his were going
to watch the fireworks.

712
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,321
He was always excited after seeing them.

713
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:08,594
He'd light up all hot.

714
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,879
Not drunk, but all in a fever.

715
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,079
Took him a while to focus on me again.

716
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,119
He'd talk about what they'd said,

717
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,636
but it was like someone else was talking.

718
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:27,314
At first we just fucked.
Whenever we talked, we fought.

719
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:29,952
It changed when his roommate left.

720
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,835
He stopped telling me about his
meetings with friends.

721
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,310
Let me know when you've had enough.

722
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,277
I'll shut up.

723
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,116
That night when he hung up,
he wasn't different

724
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,071
like all the other times.

725
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,879
I think for a few seconds or minutes

726
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:17,474
the dream I stood for was
important than his friends.

727
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,800
Instead of leaving me while he was
on the phone, he stayed with me.

728
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:28,078
I don't mean in the
kitchen where the phone is,

729
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,633
I mean with me in his head.

730
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,357
He didn't have to focus
on me like a stranger

731
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,756
like the other times before.

732
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:48,156
He talked to them the same
way he talked to me.

733
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,032
Looking at me, he told them he
was really busy. I started to sweat.

734
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,791
I felt hot, shivery.
Didn't know what to do.

735
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,592
Said he'd call them back.

736
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,391
I think they'd planned to do something
together and he'd changed his mind.

737
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,675
The girl on the phone sounded pissed off
and I think she hung up on him.

738
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,472
After, he asked me if he could meet my friends.

739
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:25,672
I said I'd never thought about it.
He knew I was lying.

740
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,274
I'd never thought about it because
I never thought we would last.

741
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,830
Until I heard him on the phone.

742
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,153
Because of his voice, his hands,

743
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,995
his skin, his eyes.

744
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,879
Even though we'd been together for a month

745
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,880
he understood.

746
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:54,310
Told me he felt the same way and
he didn't want to mix different things.

747
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,071
He knew he had to make a choice

748
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,598
and he thought he'd just made it.

749
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,836
I don't know how to explain.
You don't have to believe me

750
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:09,839
I just want you to understand

751
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,709
he wasn't asking me to do the same.

752
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,800
He wasn't asking me anything.

753
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,432
We kissed each other again...

754
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,874
and made love.

755
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,277
The only time in my life
where I really did it.

756
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,753
I know it sounds corny,
he's me and I'm him.

757
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,399
But it's true, it exists.

758
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,877
I don't know how to explain it but
we were like one person.

759
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:48,990
I wasn't holding him - there
was no difference between us.

760
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,440
Can't talk about it without
sounding mushy.

761
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,116
The words are worn out.

762
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,239
You can't crank them out.

763
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:06,921
I don't even know if he could have.

764
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:12,592
I don't remember thinking of doing this
or that to him. It just happened.

765
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,991
We weren't lying next to the table,
we weren't touching the ground.

766
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,631
You see?
You see there's no way.

767
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:26,111
Why don't words work?

768
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,111
That's what they taught us in school.

769
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,476
You know? A word for each thing
and each thing has a word.

770
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:37,876
Learn how to conjugate the verbs
and to use the complement.

771
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,159
When you say it
everybody understands it.

772
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,994
Forget the guys who spend their
time writing. It's all frills.

773
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,279
Easy. They get complimented.

774
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,717
Say what you have to say.

775
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,079
Why am I so blocked if it is so simple?
Why don't you understand?

776
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,313
Why doesn't it fit? When I try to
describe it, it sounds like a trip.

777
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,673
But I wasn't stoned.

778
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,320
Hadn't even opened the bottle of wine.

779
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:05,999
I hadn't smoked.

780
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,637
I hadn't smoked for a while.

781
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,836
Not smoked from noon.

782
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:19,431
We were twisting, rolling around.

783
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,920
Someone moaned, don't know if
it was him or me.

784
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,440
I was like a yoyo, like a...
I dunno.

785
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:35,236
Felt like I was going to
turn inside out.

786
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,032
Just as we were gonna come, we stopped,

787
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,360
held each other tightly together.

788
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,479
We burst out laughing and flipped over.

789
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,674
There's nothing we didn't do.

790
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,393
Then suddenly...

791
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:03,116
I don't know what happened.

792
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,196
We must have given the table a shove.
I don't know.

793
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:08,239
Some things fell to the floor.

794
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:11,519
I think we broke a glass or a plate...

795
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,671
...no, a glass.

796
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,432
The plates stayed on the table.

797
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,190
A knife fell in front of me,

798
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,837
a few inches from his head.

799
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,719
We started again.
We were gonna come for sure.

800
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:30,436
Felt it in every part of my body.
Thought I was about to explode.

801
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,598
I knew it was the same for him.

802
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,796
At that same time, some images
flashed before my eyes.

803
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,195
As real as his skin... our screams,

804
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:44,712
his hands and the sound of
falling glass. Pow!

805
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,316
All at the same time.
The same place.

806
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:54,389
They say you see your life flash
before you when you die,

807
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:57,599
but it was like I was being born.

808
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:03,593
I saw what was before me.
Like I was alive in an earthquake.

809
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:08,753
He was so beautiful, large
so... everything.

810
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,669
We were naked. It felt beautiful.
He was like fur and like rock.

811
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:16,638
He made me as beautiful as him.

812
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:24,791
He transfigured me.
It was like nothing else.

813
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:29,479
And one second later... didn't know if it
was in my head or ass. And the next second...

814
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:34,597
that same moment when the knife fell,
that very instant, I heard it.

815
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:38,956
We came. Together.
Not me, not him. Both of us.

816
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:42,799
I saw the two of us. Me going back to
my johns, or deciding not to

817
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,677
and him fighting with his friends.

818
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,198
How long would we have
been able to hold on?

819
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:55,157
How long?

820
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,591
You called me an asshole before.

821
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,834
Think I feel insulted?

822
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,874
Think I don't know why you said it?

823
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:31,836
Think I don't know how you
wanted me to feel?

824
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,318
You think it's the first time
I've been called that?

825
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,077
Know what it's like to fuck a guy who's

826
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:45,398
tall and fat with greasy hair,
pimples and a drunkard's nose?

827
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,353
Knowing he was handsome once and it's
not just age that's made him this way.

828
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:54,036
The marriage, the kids, the job

829
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:58,119
You're scared he's gonna have a heart attack

830
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:01,958
as he jumps on you like a tiger.
It puffs, it pushes, it roars and sweats.

831
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,680
His eyes as big as a kid a Christmas.
He can't believe it. He wants more!

832
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,958
But he comes after two minutes.

833
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,440
Later the fear sets in.

834
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:17,873
Fear of getting caught.
His job, wife, kids and the pension.

835
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,436
Fearing the world'll find out he's a fag.

836
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,556
He tries to collect himself while I piss.

837
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,233
Doesn't know where to hide.
Can't even get his pants on.

838
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,751
He sees his real life heading
straight back at him.

839
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,440
Thinks it's a moment of weakness, that's all.

840
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:42,755
Sees his work, his wife, his kids,
the two houses and the big car.

841
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,593
He nearly promised them to me before.

842
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,915
But that was then...

843
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,750
he feels like after an epileptic fit.

844
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:57,400
He came. It's over. He won't do it again.

845
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,199
Then he gets angry.

846
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,958
Tosses your clothes at the door
and throws you the money.

847
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,317
Comes over to the bathroom and
he can't stop himself and screams,

848
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,669
"Get out! Get out you dirty scum!"

849
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,759
"You hear me, get out!"

850
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,833
And...

851
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:25,759
if you're fool enough to tell
anyone, a pal...

852
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,752
what you thought while you were on the can.

853
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:34,356
That maybe this time he'll be nice to
you because you know

854
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:36,478
and you know that he knows it,

855
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,835
that if he does throw a fit...

856
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:46,194
you'll never give him a kiss
and go for a walk with him again.

857
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,873
Give him the one thing in
life that he can't have.

858
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:55,309
If you're stupid enough to tell anyone

859
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,995
they'll call you naive.

860
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,359
Naive.

861
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,871
How can you spend 10 minutes making
love with someone just once

862
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:17,036
and not know what's killing them?

863
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,796
How can you do 5 guys a day
and not want to get involved?

864
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:27,551
How?

865
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,595
How?!

866
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,711
It's my job to get involved.

867
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,390
The only way I can, with my ass.

868
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,434
If all I've got is my ass, then fuck.
That's how I'll get involved.

869
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:49,440
And him... in his eyes...

870
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,631
Claude's...

871
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,919
I saw what tore him apart.

872
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,272
What we suddenly understood.

873
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,078
That's why we kept stopping before coming.
15 times.

874
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,794
Each time it went up a notch and kept going.

875
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:20,916
And when the glass hit the floor...

876
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:25,076
in that second I knew I had to do something.

877
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,473
That we couldn't leave the house like before.

878
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,274
We musn't try to keep going. Musn't.

879
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,749
What's real is him shouting,

880
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,396
crying for joy in my arms.

881
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:45,198
I felt like I was drowning,
then finally, I could breathe.

882
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:48,553
I was drowning in him, with him.

883
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,072
But the rest of the world...

884
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,791
the opposite of what was
happening to us was shit.

885
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,429
I know in the real world you have
to take everything, not just the beauty.

886
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,832
There is shit too.

887
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,314
Cost me a lot to learn that.

888
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,751
But I wasn't thinking of anything else,
I was there. Just there.

889
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:21,629
We couldn't hide away to
live this great love...

890
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:29,871
and we couldn't have this again to
deal with in the real world.

891
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:52,037
Suddenly, I notice that I had
a knife in my hand.

892
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,112
Don't know how, but...

893
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,710
I could feel myself going off.

894
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:01,873
Both sides ready to explode.

895
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,874
I heard us scream and then

896
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:12,799
suddenly we were drowning.
I heard the scream again and saw his throat.

897
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,514
I heard bubbles like in a milkshake,

898
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,677
and then just as I was drowning
and exploding,

899
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:28,752
I saw we'd never leave this place again.

900
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,879
The knife gone and I screamed.

901
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,830
He was coming and his
blood splattered the walls,

902
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:39,391
the fridge, the stove, the tables
and I kissed him all over,

903
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:44,637
kissed the wound on his throat
and tasted his blood.

904
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,639
It was all over me!

905
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:50,755
He was shuddering, arching and
trembling just like me.

906
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,199
I looked at him.

907
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,197
He was beautiful.

908
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,279
He wasn't holding his throat.

909
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,434
I was worried it had hurt,
but I'm sure it didn't.

910
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:32,113
No, he was smiling.

911
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,229
His arms were spread out.

912
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:43,633
He couldn't hold his throat,
he was holding onto me.

913
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,871
I just hope...

914
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,873
he didn't see the images I did.

915
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:05,357
I just hope that he was being born

916
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,154
without seeing the other side of

917
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,920
the coin.

918
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,796
I closed his eyes.

919
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,554
I couldn't even do that for my dad

920
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:26,876
because I wasn't there when he died.

921
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,797
My mother either,

922
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,513
she died alone.

923
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,789
My brother, him...

924
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,032
my second...

925
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,799
my reflection

926
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,880
him yes.

927
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,157
I closed his eyes.

928
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:57,476
He died from pleasure,

929
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,753
without having to spend his days in shit.

930
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,873
I loved him.

931
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:40,631
I told you this because nothing
means anything.

932
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,678
Only him.

933
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,959
The memory of him means something.

934
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:53,269
I never thought about it
but in killing him,

935
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,353
I killed myself.

936
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,552
That's what I wanted.

937
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:03,351
Now, while waiting to die...

938
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,991
he's alive in me.

939
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,470
Like no one else knew him

940
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:12,999
nobody in the world

941
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,597
only me.

942
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,311
But now it's all coming apart.

943
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:30,433
So, before the memory of him unravels

944
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:36,678
I'm giving up.

945
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:06,277
When you were yelling at me

946
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,992
I realized that

947
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,834
since deciding to come here Saturday night

948
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,557
I felt like in a fever.
