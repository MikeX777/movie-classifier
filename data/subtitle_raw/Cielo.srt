1
00:03:49,143 --> 00:03:51,562
No one ever sees this part
 of an astronomer's life.

2
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,608
People imagine that we show up
 and just look around

3
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,859
and we're all famous.

4
00:03:56,943 --> 00:03:59,153
Everything is perfect
 and it all works out just fine.

5
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:00,655
But sometimes you get here,

6
00:04:00,738 --> 00:04:03,825
and there's nothing
 but clouds and more clouds.

7
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:05,535
I don't think it will clear up.

8
00:04:05,618 --> 00:04:06,953
It's depressing.

9
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,540
And minutes go by
 but it doesn't clear.

10
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,794
Should we switch on a light
 and do a calibration?

11
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:18,381
So we can see a spectrum.

12
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:21,592
I'm curious about this.

13
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:30,101
I'm missing those two.

14
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:32,728
No, they're there.

15
00:04:32,812 --> 00:04:34,522
See? Here and here.

16
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,858
And those little ones
 in between.

17
00:04:37,358 --> 00:04:38,693
Those two?

18
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:42,738
I think it's like this.

19
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:54,625
I thought we'd lost the star
 for a second there!

20
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:03,259
Those of us who are physicists
 have so much in our minds,

21
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:05,553
we are overwhelmed
 by nature per se.

22
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:08,139
We think about it
 all the time.

23
00:05:08,514 --> 00:05:11,809
Maybe you think about it
 all the time!

24
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:16,772
I don't spend my whole life
 thinking about it.

25
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:20,443
But it's striking.

26
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:25,573
You don't even need the sky

27
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:28,284
to understand
 how big nature is.

28
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:30,494
How wise it is.

29
00:05:30,578 --> 00:05:33,164
How much information
 we fail to notice.

30
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:36,250
An atom, everything
 is a universe in itself.

31
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:40,588
Your work is to constantly
 be watching the sky.

32
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,757
It must be extraordinary.

33
00:05:43,383 --> 00:05:46,719
I think that
 if you watch the sky...

34
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,350
I mean, from the moment
 that you look at it

35
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:56,729
with profundity and tranquility,
 you realize that

36
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,942
the sky is there.

37
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:03,319
My God, so many things
 are up there!

38
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:05,863
I believe that this realization
 happens to everyone

39
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:08,115
who really looks at the sky.

40
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:11,827
It hits them the very first time
 they look at the sky.

41
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:19,877
I can't fathom
 that a human being can look up

42
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,712
and not be genuinely amazed.

43
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:29,178
-Does this happen to you?
 -Yes.

44
00:06:31,348 --> 00:06:33,724
Does it happen
 every time you look at the sky?

45
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:35,643
-I think so.
 -Or only when...

46
00:06:36,143 --> 00:06:38,355
Every time
 I look at the sky here,

47
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:40,440
I don't know how to express it.

48
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:43,192
The silence.

49
00:06:43,693 --> 00:06:45,194
The beauty.

50
00:06:46,654 --> 00:06:50,533
In Chile, it's like
 we can touch the sky.

51
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,660
And the stars...

52
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:36,198
I´m inspired by these mountains

53
00:09:41,328 --> 00:09:43,956
to take care of the earth.

54
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,127
They remind me of images
 I have seen of Mars,

55
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,795
which is all desert.

56
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:54,634
They say that there could have
 been life there,

57
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:57,052
but there's no life now.

58
00:09:57,387 --> 00:10:01,140
For an astronomer,
 I am very earth-centred.

59
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:04,519
I like physics,

60
00:10:05,478 --> 00:10:07,606
but I am not a spiritual person.

61
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:09,982
I don't look at the stars

62
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,569
and have profound thoughts.

63
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:15,863
I look at the stars

64
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:19,492
and I always think
 about the earth.

65
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:20,993
Look, we have wars.

66
00:10:21,076 --> 00:10:22,662
People are hungry.

67
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:25,415
People are homeless.

68
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:28,418
People can't find work
 to support their families.

69
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:31,463
And look how insignificant
 we are.

70
00:10:31,546 --> 00:10:32,922
We are absolutely nothing.

71
00:10:33,297 --> 00:10:36,635
We are so tiny in the immensity
 of the universe.

72
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:39,303
Why do we have to live
 like this?

73
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,057
Instead of living in harmony
 and helping each other.

74
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:48,312
Trying to further
 the progress of humanity

75
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:55,277
in a positive way,
 to make things better.

76
00:10:56,237 --> 00:10:58,406
Not just to kill each other.

77
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:08,333
I always think
 of this amusing analogy.

78
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:12,044
Human beings
 are the equivalent

79
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:15,005
of ants living in an ant's nest.

80
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:19,301
The ants go to find food
 to bring back to the nest.

81
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:23,013
And when an ant comes up
 and looks around,

82
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:27,017
I wonder what is it thinking?

83
00:11:27,101 --> 00:11:29,646
I mean, I don't believe
 an ant thinks,

84
00:11:29,729 --> 00:11:31,855
but what does an ant see?

85
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:45,202
For us,
 as observers of the universe,

86
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:46,621
it's kind of the same.

87
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:50,249
We are ants
 looking through a telescope.

88
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:54,962
But is the universe really
 what we happen to see?

89
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:58,341
Or is it just
 what we are capable of seeing?

90
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:09,394
An ant could never fathom
 that it lives on a planet

91
00:12:09,477 --> 00:12:12,980
that is round,
 or that has mountains, etcetera.

92
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:15,232
And we are kind of the same.

93
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:18,902
Like the ants, we look
 and see what we can see,

94
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:23,115
but we can't grasp
 the immensity of the universe.

95
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:35,919
When I speak with people

96
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,300
who have an explanation
 for everything,

97
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:43,595
and who think
 they know everything,

98
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:46,889
I just think

99
00:12:49,016 --> 00:12:51,519
that's an impossibility.

100
00:13:01,111 --> 00:13:03,155
Because we aren't looking down
 from above,

101
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:05,032
we are looking upward
 from below.

102
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,340
Hey you, don´t be so nosy!

103
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,010
Nosy little buggers!
 Go outside!

104
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:50,597
Out!
 This one is so stubborn.

105
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,142
Right, you´re pouring
 some gasoline over it.

106
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:59,606
You know what?
 Let's add those plastic bags.

107
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,571
Now I want the shiny knife.

108
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:11,701
You should cut it in half.
 Not destroy it.

109
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:14,704
I´ve already destroyed it.

110
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:17,080
I'm taking it out
 on the chicken.

111
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,878
I have to take it out
 on something!

112
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,838
How is the wine?

113
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,465
Is it off?

114
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:29,511
No, it tastes...

115
00:15:31,554 --> 00:15:33,055
It´s not bad.

116
00:15:34,724 --> 00:15:37,309
Not bad at all.

117
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:42,357
The factory makes crappy wine.

118
00:15:43,816 --> 00:15:46,528
Sure, it´s not a bottle
 of San Pedro.

119
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,613
It's fine for making vinegar!

120
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:52,074
No use to you
 because it´s a bit sweet, right?

121
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:53,535
Yes, a bit sweet.

122
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:57,287
-You find it sweet?
 -A bit sweet and acidic.

123
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,545
What do the people see
 in the sky here?

124
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:08,215
You can see shooting stars
 around here.

125
00:16:08,298 --> 00:16:10,050
You see them sneaking in

126
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:11,844
and then they disappear.

127
00:16:11,928 --> 00:16:14,304
I don't know,
 maybe they fall into the sea.

128
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:17,224
People call them shooting stars.

129
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:19,811
You see them a lot.

130
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:21,938
Mostly in the summer,

131
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:24,732
because the sky is clear,
 so you can see them falling.

132
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:27,276
In Mexico,
 where you are from...

133
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,736
From Canada.

134
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,906
In your country,
 you look at the sky, don't you?

135
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,199
But I live in the city.

136
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:38,580
With all the lights and buildings,
 you can't see anything.

137
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:40,790
Of course,
 you don't appreciate it.

138
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:44,544
If there are too many lights,
 you don't see anything.

139
00:16:44,627 --> 00:16:45,878
The sky is hidden.

140
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:50,215
We spend so much time
 looking down.

141
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,135
When I arrived in this desert

142
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,679
and watched the sky,

143
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:58,307
it was as if I was seeing it
 for the first time.

144
00:16:59,434 --> 00:17:02,604
I had never seen a sky
 so alive,

145
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:04,187
so profound.

146
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:07,483
It seems as if we watch the sky
 less and less.

147
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:10,235
Is it the same here?

148
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,363
I remember in the old days,

149
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,991
my grandparents,
 who have since passed away,

150
00:17:15,074 --> 00:17:19,119
they loved looking up
 at the night sky.

151
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:21,956
Every single night
 they'd go outside,

152
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,335
sit on their bench
 and watch the sky.

153
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:29,005
That was in the countryside.

154
00:17:29,088 --> 00:17:31,507
They have been dead
 for ages.

155
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:36,721
But they loved watching
 what was happening in the night sky.

156
00:17:37,137 --> 00:17:40,016
The elders gave names
 to all of the stars.

157
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:43,185
The Three Marías, the Bright Star.

158
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:46,105
We have names
 for almost all the stars.

159
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:52,612
One night in the desert,

160
00:17:52,695 --> 00:17:55,990
I lay on the ground
 watching the stars.

161
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:58,241
I felt like...

162
00:17:59,118 --> 00:18:01,203
I felt like it was moving.

163
00:18:01,621 --> 00:18:04,540
Have you ever felt that?

164
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:07,502
You mean how it moves?

165
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:08,670
Yes, that´s right.

166
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,756
I think the earth moves.
 I don't believe the sky is moving.

167
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,011
No. I'm telling you,
 the Earth has two movements,

168
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:20,263
rotation and revolution.

169
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:24,686
Revolution follows
 the line of the equator,

170
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,564
and rotation is
 around the magnetic poles.

171
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:32,610
It has to turn and move that way,
 or else we would fall.

172
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:36,321
No sweetie!
 You're just like Columbus

173
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,700
who believed
 that the earth was flat.

174
00:18:38,783 --> 00:18:40,952
But there must be some way

175
00:18:41,035 --> 00:18:43,746
that we hold ourselves upright
 in the night.

176
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,915
If not, we'd fall off.

177
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:48,793
No, you don't understand!

178
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:50,837
Right now,
 it's daytime for us,

179
00:18:51,879 --> 00:18:55,550
and in the part below,
 it's nighttime.

180
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:58,594
And when night falls here,

181
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:01,472
it's day in the other part
 and night here for us.

182
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:04,434
Right now,
 we are belly up!

183
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:09,814
We are upside down,
 the others are not.

184
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:13,484
But then how do we
 hold ourselves upright?

185
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:16,404
It's because of the...
 What is it called?

186
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:22,325
Gravity!

187
00:19:24,495 --> 00:19:27,832
That's why there's gravity!

188
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:53,477
The way I feel...

189
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,898
I arrived here
 when I was very young.

190
00:21:57,523 --> 00:22:00,902
Once every two or three months,

191
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:04,989
we travelled to Vallenar
 to buy supplies.

192
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:07,825
We just went for a short time
 and came back.

193
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:10,161
And I thought...

194
00:22:10,786 --> 00:22:16,083
When night fell,
 the cars turned on their headlights.

195
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:20,463
But I didn't know
 what headlights were!

196
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:23,799
I thought that the stars
 had come down.

197
00:22:23,883 --> 00:22:26,928
I think it must be the same

198
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,722
for someone
 who's used to city lights

199
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:33,851
and who sees natural light,
 like a star.

200
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:36,312
It must seem different to them,

201
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,941
and strange at the same time.

202
00:22:51,327 --> 00:22:54,038
There's something amazing
 about the desert here.

203
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,916
It's as though everything
 is alive, right?

204
00:22:57,625 --> 00:23:00,337
Yes, I've had experiences,

205
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:07,093
when I was young and even now,
 working at night.

206
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,762
There are apparitions.

207
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:13,140
I've seen people
 who don't actually exist.

208
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:20,606
But something more intimate
 happened when I was young.

209
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:24,318
A young girl appeared
 out of nowhere.

210
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,113
She accompanied me
 until I was older.

211
00:23:27,613 --> 00:23:29,366
And then I didn't see her again.

212
00:23:33,828 --> 00:23:36,163
We did not speak,

213
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:38,874
we just gestured.

214
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,293
When I was feeling bad,

215
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,796
I would feel better
 when she was around.

216
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:47,842
But we never communicated
 like you and I are doing right now.

217
00:23:50,678 --> 00:23:52,431
Was it like a spirit?

218
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,893
Yes, but more than a spirit,
 an angel I believe.

219
00:23:58,978 --> 00:24:00,397
An angel from the sky?

220
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:02,940
That would be beautiful.

221
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:05,735
The sky will never stop
 being beautiful.

222
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,197
At least the sky here
 is different than in other places,

223
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:13,701
even though it is the same.

224
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:20,875
I am afraid of not being able
 to see the sky one day.

225
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,754
And I wonder,

226
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:30,551
are there beings out there
 like us, or who think like us?

227
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:35,097
I have always believed
 that we aren't the only ones.

228
00:24:36,932 --> 00:24:41,062
When I was a child,
 I would go out with my flashlight

229
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:44,399
and shine it upwards
 to see if they would respond.

230
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:47,943
What would happen
 if someone replied?

231
00:24:48,027 --> 00:24:51,322
What would we do?
 Maybe we would run away.

232
00:24:52,865 --> 00:24:55,701
The sky is always interesting.
 Always.

233
00:26:57,698 --> 00:26:59,825
-What is that?
 -A UFO.

234
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,204
I see four.

235
00:27:03,287 --> 00:27:06,081
I'm not sure how
 the lights are divided.

236
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:08,042
Sometimes they spin.

237
00:27:09,293 --> 00:27:11,671
They spin like propellers,
 but slowly.

238
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,350
I can't tell what this might be.

239
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,893
It looks like a red spot.

240
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:28,647
I don't know if it's a UFO or what.
 There are two small objects.

241
00:27:29,188 --> 00:27:31,483
Can't make out what it is.

242
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:49,124
There are two of them.

243
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,355
There are beings and spirits.

244
00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:13,733
I'll tell you how it happened.

245
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:22,659
Once I was with Negro Fernando
 and Ricardo and another guy.

246
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:29,873
There was something big and tall
 in that area and it stopped there.

247
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,753
We all said,
 "Look at that!"

248
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,132
All of a sudden, it disappeared.

249
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,012
-Was it spinning?
 -No, it was still.

250
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:49,644
It's like at night,
 when you can see lights and flashes.

251
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,771
It shined beautifully

252
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:56,443
and all of us stayed there
 watching it for quite a while.

253
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,028
Then it disappeared.

254
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,907
And Negro said,
 "What was that?"

255
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:07,662
Some people say they exist,
 but do you believe...

256
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,707
-In Martians?
 -Yes.

257
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:19,214
They say that extraterrestrials
 live up there on other planets,

258
00:29:19,882 --> 00:29:22,217
and they can come down,

259
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:27,139
fall in love and have a child.

260
00:29:27,222 --> 00:29:30,934
And the children
 would be demigods.

261
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:33,937
And these planets
 are superior to ours?

262
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,400
I believe that
 we're more evil than them.

263
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,489
That's probably why
 they don't show up,

264
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,865
because they know we're evil.

265
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:03,778
I slept so well!

266
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,656
Let's light the campfire, okay?

267
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,367
Did it go out? I was sleeping.

268
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:27,630
The scientists, they say
 we are the dust of stars

269
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,384
And their offspring
 treading in their footsteps

270
00:33:55,908 --> 00:34:00,203
Yet I've only seen dust
 deep beneath the ground

271
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,167
Toiling in the mine
 in air heavy like stone

272
00:34:32,152 --> 00:34:36,741
Sometimes I want to go above
 to stare at my wide-eyed star

273
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,496
She shines from far away
 over the desolate land

274
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,267
My search for gold is fruitless

275
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,938
I search but I get no answer

276
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,817
But I think
 there's a true-hearted star

277
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,694
Singing to me in the sky

278
00:35:50,272 --> 00:35:54,527
That pretty pale blue light
 no one can hide

279
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,824
An impossible dream
 shaped by time into a star

280
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:12,003
She shines brighter than gold
 and remains sleepless by my side

281
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,883
I want you always near

282
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:21,179
Star of mine, Isabela

283
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,817
This music feels right
 for that planet.

284
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,362
What's the name of your planet?

285
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,114
The planet is not mine.

286
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,911
A Swiss group discovered it.

287
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,163
It's called WASP 4.

288
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,083
But we have our own name for it.

289
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,337
We call it the Golem.

290
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,969
What are sunsets like there?

291
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,473
Apparently, considering the clouds
 that we see now,

292
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,726
sunrise and sunset on this planet
 must be white.

293
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,980
If you were on that planet,
 you would not notice a change.

294
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:21,484
Maybe you wouldn't even know
 if it was day or night.

295
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,058
Let's go to WASP 50.

296
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,828
We are watching the star
 all the time.

297
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,999
What will happen is a planet
 will cross in front of it.

298
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,627
So the brightness of the star,
 which should be fairly constant,

299
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,463
will suddenly diminish.

300
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:28,468
We will see an eclipse now,
 when the planet eclipses its star.

301
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,137
So this decrease in light

302
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,640
will bring us all the information
 about the planet's atmosphere.

303
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,211
And the light of the star,

304
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,297
how does it travel
 all the way to us?

305
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:12,219
Each ray of light is created
 in the centre of the star.

306
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,263
This is very chaotic.

307
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,142
Protons colliding with protons,
 generating new elements.

308
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:21,771
From all this chaos,
 a ray of light escapes.

309
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,150
Now, that ray of light
 leaving the centre of the star

310
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,819
takes millions
 or hundreds of thousands of years

311
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,821
to exit the star,

312
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,574
and then reaches the atmosphere.

313
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:37,244
It must be crazy,
 with storms circling around.

314
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,955
It goes through
 the planet's atmosphere,

315
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,501
it leaves,

316
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:47,213
and easily travels
 for hundreds of years through space,

317
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:53,512
until it meets this pale blue dot
 that is the Earth.

318
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,556
The light continues to travel
 until it reaches the telescope.

319
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,309
It goes inside, bouncing around
 the entire optical system.

320
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,647
That light is transformed
 into current.

321
00:42:05,482 --> 00:42:09,235
That's what goes into the computer.
 It's what we analyze.

322
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,283
I find it magical.

323
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:19,829
We observe the light as it arrives
 and passes through the telescope.

324
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,581
We analyze it right away.

325
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,918
We see the eclipse right away.
 It's incredible.

326
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,830
In my imagination,
 I can see the eclipse directly.

327
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,585
I imagine exactly
 what is happening,

328
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,629
or rather, what happened
 in this case.

329
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,513
It must be hundreds or thousands
 of light-years away,

330
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:21,265
so all of this happened
 hundreds or thousands of years ago.

331
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,309
But we are seeing it now.

332
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:26,270
We are seeing this information
 reach us in real time,

333
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:28,772
as the planet
 passes in front of the star.

334
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:42,197
I think I'm flying among the stars.

335
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,914
Because I see a beautiful moon.

336
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,590
It seems as though
 the earth is far away.

337
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,280
In those days,
 animals could speak.

338
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:54,204
Fox was walking over the hill.

339
00:47:55,038 --> 00:48:00,378
And Fox met Condor,
 who was carrying his guitar.

340
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,382
Condor said to Fox,

341
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:08,428
"We are invited
 to a party in the sky."

342
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,140
"Let's go!"

343
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:17,102
And Fox says, "How can I get there
 if I can't fly?"

344
00:48:19,856 --> 00:48:23,860
So Condor says,
 "You can get on here."

345
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,197
Condor, the guitar player,

346
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,410
slung the instrument
 over his chest.

347
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:39,082
And Fox went on Condor's back,

348
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,422
until they arrived in the sky.

349
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,967
When they arrived,
 they saw some guests,

350
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,886
and the party seemed just so-so.

351
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:52,972
They were the main artists,

352
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:57,226
because
 everyone in the Universe knew

353
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,730
that Condor played the guitar
 beautifully

354
00:49:00,813 --> 00:49:03,441
and that Fox danced very well,

355
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:06,276
especially when he wore
 his silver spurs.

356
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:11,073
So the party kicked off in the sky,
 and the next day,

357
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,452
the hosts said, "We have to pay Fox

358
00:49:14,536 --> 00:49:18,498
"because Fox made everyone happy,
 everyone danced all night."

359
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:23,002
So they started bringing
 small bags full of seeds.

360
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:29,384
And the seeds that Fox
 carried heavily on his back

361
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:33,012
were hurled to the four corners
 of the earth.

362
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:40,645
That's how all the trees, herbs
 and shrubs that we see nowadays

363
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:42,855
came to be.

364
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:05,855
I remember my grandmother
 was tall and skinny.

365
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,442
She used to wear thin skirts
 that stuck to her body.

366
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:13,988
I was the only grandchild,
 the only child in the valley!

367
00:51:14,072 --> 00:51:15,615
I was the only one!

368
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,076
She said to me,

369
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:22,287
when people look at the sky

370
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:26,249
and see what we call
 shooting stars,

371
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,046
they should spit three times.

372
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,719
If not,
 the star will steal your memory.

373
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:39,639
That is what my grandmother said.

374
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:41,808
The star will steal your memory.

375
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:47,480
I don't know what a star
 has to do with your memory.

376
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:53,820
Also in the sky
 is what we call,

377
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:58,240
what people today call
 the Magellanic clouds,

378
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:00,993
those patches of cloud
 in the night sky.

379
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:04,122
The old people called them
 guanaco's mudholes.

380
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:08,876
The guanacos
 in the mountains around here,

381
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,504
they have specific places
 they go to roll around.

382
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,798
They give themselves a dust bath.

383
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:17,802
They wallow around,
 covering their bodies in dust.

384
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:21,221
They say that what we see
 in the sky from Earth

385
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,474
are the mudholes of guanacos.

386
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:26,936
Did your grandmother talk
 about the Milky Way?

387
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:29,689
I heard that the ancestors

388
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:33,526
saw animals
 in the dark patches of the sky.

389
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:38,072
Llamas, birds and foxes.

390
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:43,619
What we call the Milky Way
 is a river.

391
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:50,710
There must be something to it,

392
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:54,130
since she would always say
 that it's a river.

393
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:02,805
When someone died,
 we had to kill a dog for them.

394
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:10,104
This dog would help its owner

395
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:13,441
swim across the river in the sky.

396
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:19,030
So people would kill
 the dead person's favourite dog

397
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,407
and the dog would join his master

398
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:25,119
so they could cross the river,
 on their way to the sky.

399
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:36,756
The ancestors were keen observers.

400
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,716
They made astronomical
 observations.

401
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:42,845
It's been said that
 the Southern Cross or Chakana

402
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:46,432
was a very important symbol
 for ancient native cultures.

403
00:53:47,058 --> 00:53:50,520
That's why we can see it
 in rock art

404
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,563
and petroglyphs.

405
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:57,443
In the Southern Cross, you see
 the duality between man and woman,

406
00:53:57,527 --> 00:53:59,779
winter and summer,
 day and night.

407
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,906
Life and death.

408
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:14,373
Man is pure dust

409
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:17,208
Among so many tracks

410
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:20,670
Needn´t go to the sky

411
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:24,966
To reach the stars

412
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:48,132
The constellation that I like

413
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:51,470
and that always
 brings back memories

414
00:57:52,345 --> 00:57:54,847
is the constellation
 they call Orion,

415
00:57:55,432 --> 00:57:57,808
where the Three Marías are.

416
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:03,147
It always makes me think

417
00:58:03,606 --> 00:58:07,151
of my daughter, who died.

418
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,945
Before she died,
 she used to say,

419
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:12,615
"That star is me."

420
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:14,367
"I am that star."

421
00:58:16,536 --> 00:58:18,746
I always remember this.

422
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,752
The sky is like...

423
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,259
How can I say it?

424
00:58:32,344 --> 00:58:34,303
It's like family.

425
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:38,475
It's like seeing your brother,
 your cousins there.

426
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:42,479
There's my mother, my daughter,
 my cousins.

427
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:47,484
And they are visiting me.
 They are watching me from up there.

428
00:58:47,817 --> 00:58:51,488
My daughter is up there,
 she's watching me from her star.

429
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:56,826
And others as well,
 they are watching us.

430
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:40,467
One metre of surplus!
 One metre extra below!

431
01:02:45,805 --> 01:02:50,059
COCKTAIL OK

432
01:03:11,498 --> 01:03:13,874
-Okay, cheers!
 -Cheers!

433
01:03:16,336 --> 01:03:19,631
-Yes, we had first light.
 -Out of focus, however.

434
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:24,344
He was happy
 because the camera was working.

435
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:30,099
Everyone have a seat.

436
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:59,379
Just a moment, please.

437
01:04:00,463 --> 01:04:02,799
I'd like to make a toast.

438
01:04:03,675 --> 01:04:07,637
As scientists, you know
 that there are always questions.

439
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,682
One question leads to another.

440
01:04:10,765 --> 01:04:13,225
There's an infinity of questions.

441
01:04:13,685 --> 01:04:16,438
It won't surprise you that tonight,

442
01:04:16,521 --> 01:04:18,815
I have yet another question.

443
01:04:19,858 --> 01:04:22,610
What is your true connection
 with the sky?

444
01:04:26,906 --> 01:04:28,408
One at a time!

445
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:35,540
First things first.

446
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,794
To the sky!

447
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:42,881
Which nourishes us
 and quenches our thirst.

448
01:04:46,718 --> 01:04:48,595
That's the wisdom of the earth.

449
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:59,146
-He didn't get it.
 -What does that mean?

450
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:01,649
-That the sky nourishes us?
 -Yes.

451
01:05:01,733 --> 01:05:03,275
Well...

452
01:05:23,796 --> 01:05:26,508
So you're an exoplanet hunter?

453
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:29,552
But what does that really mean?

454
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:32,221
It's like science fiction.

455
01:05:33,556 --> 01:05:35,642
And why do you chase planets?

456
01:05:36,225 --> 01:05:38,603
Why does this matter to us?

457
01:05:41,397 --> 01:05:46,694
Planet hunting resonates
 with the public

458
01:05:47,529 --> 01:05:51,407
because it raises fundamental
 questions about our origins,

459
01:05:51,491 --> 01:05:52,992
about why we are here.

460
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:56,704
And these questions are connected

461
01:05:57,037 --> 01:05:59,874
to our habitat, our earth,

462
01:06:00,207 --> 01:06:03,503
but also to the existence
 of other similar worlds elsewhere

463
01:06:03,586 --> 01:06:05,547
and maybe of life elsewhere.

464
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:10,133
So when we explain to people

465
01:06:10,217 --> 01:06:14,263
that we are looking for planets
 and for life elsewhere,

466
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:17,684
obviously it resonates profoundly.

467
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:20,436
These are age-old questions

468
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:24,357
that everyone has wondered about
 at some point or another.

469
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:28,277
And often, we think about them
 when we look up at the sky.

470
01:06:37,954 --> 01:06:44,084
And that's how it's connected
 to our understanding of the sky.

471
01:06:45,044 --> 01:06:48,006
We feel renewed because

472
01:06:48,255 --> 01:06:52,217
when we watch the sky,
 we forget everything we've learned.

473
01:06:52,677 --> 01:06:56,639
We see the immensity in front of us,

474
01:06:57,306 --> 01:06:59,976
and not just in terms of distance.

475
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:05,023
Of course, people have trouble
 understanding such huge distances.

476
01:07:06,691 --> 01:07:08,818
But there's also an immensity
 of possibilities.

477
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:11,446
In the sky, our imagination
 takes flight

478
01:07:11,529 --> 01:07:13,615
and everything is possible.

479
01:07:30,048 --> 01:07:33,009
Everything that opens our minds
 is important

480
01:07:33,092 --> 01:07:35,135
and is a catalyst for our growth.

481
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:38,097
Historically,
 the sky is the first level.

482
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:42,560
And then understanding the sky,
 and what's behind the sky,

483
01:07:42,644 --> 01:07:44,020
that's the second level.

484
01:07:45,396 --> 01:07:48,024
For me,
 that's what astrophysics is.

485
01:07:53,029 --> 01:07:56,908
It's the scientific explanation

486
01:07:56,991 --> 01:07:59,744
for the wanderings
 of our imagination

487
01:07:59,827 --> 01:08:02,080
beyond the screen of the sky.

488
01:08:48,751 --> 01:08:51,879
If we want to go to a planet
 that we discover,

489
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:55,550
which might be
 a hundred light years away,

490
01:08:55,633 --> 01:08:57,760
it will take us 10,000 years
 to get there.

491
01:08:57,844 --> 01:09:00,096
10,000 years to get there.

492
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:03,391
So we either put people to sleep
 and wake them when they arrive,

493
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:06,894
and here we're starting
 to get into science fiction,

494
01:09:08,354 --> 01:09:10,815
which I've always loved,
 and I still love.

495
01:09:11,107 --> 01:09:14,026
Or else we create
 something like Noah's ark.

496
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:16,696
We send out families

497
01:09:16,779 --> 01:09:19,115
and a future generation will arrive.

498
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:53,510
