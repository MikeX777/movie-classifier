1
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:53,210
Boy!

2
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:55,825
What kind of music is this?
I've never heard it before.

3
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:56,669
Cavara.

4
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,027
Is somebody behind you?

5
00:03:59,503 --> 00:04:00,394
Come out.

6
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:02,877
I'd like to see who's sleeping on the job
instead of working.

7
00:04:04,116 --> 00:04:05,616
Oh. I see...

8
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:08,396
Carrying on inside my wagon, are you?

9
00:04:11,091 --> 00:04:12,091
Let's go.

10
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:14,762
Come on.

11
00:04:15,285 --> 00:04:16,449
Such thrash.

12
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:18,549
Go on!

13
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:26,549
Did you clean all ze bottles
and test tubes in ze laboratory?

14
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:28,031
Yes Baron, I did.

15
00:04:28,062 --> 00:04:30,257
I worked ze whole night
to clean up everything.

16
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:32,830
And why do ze studio look
in such a mess lately?

17
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:35,517
How could it?
I fixed up all ze things.

18
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:38,327
You know I like things clean and bright.

19
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,280
How can I work in a mess like that?

20
00:04:43,054 --> 00:04:46,171
When I was study under professor
Blümberg and Fringhs

21
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:49,318
We had to wipe ze floors for two years.

22
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:51,943
Before I could stick my nose
into ze laboratory.

23
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:53,854
But Baron?
You know I believe in your work.

24
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:55,511
We worked so hard together.

25
00:04:55,582 --> 00:04:57,129
We did everything in ze laboratory.

26
00:04:57,154 --> 00:04:59,245
And I'm so grateful to you
that I could do that.

27
00:04:59,557 --> 00:05:00,885
I know, I know...

28
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:01,652
Otto.

29
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:03,369
You've been a very good assistant.

30
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,416
And you brought in some good parts.

31
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:09,783
That Manus was perfect.

32
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:11,339
Thank you Baron.

33
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:14,643
But what we really need now
is ze perfect...

34
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:17,049
'nasum.'

35
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:18,127
Yes.

36
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:21,341
Somezing that will
represent ze finest feature

37
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:24,052
of ze Serbian ideals.

38
00:05:24,393 --> 00:05:26,089
What do you mean by this?
Serbian ideals?

39
00:05:26,114 --> 00:05:27,877
I have never heard
about it before.

40
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:29,713
But Otto, you don't understand.

41
00:05:30,006 --> 00:05:31,444
Ze Serbian race

42
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,154
comes in direct descent

43
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:36,209
of ze glory from ze ancient Greeks!

44
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,606
Oh, I didn't know that.

45
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:38,831
But...

46
00:05:38,856 --> 00:05:40,942
Where will you find those kind of nose?

47
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:42,976
In town Otto.
In town.

48
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,012
Oohh...

49
00:05:44,715 --> 00:05:46,504
I remember when I went to school.

50
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,160
Our guvernante was taking my sister
and myself every day to school.

51
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,053
And I saw this creature of ze road.

52
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:53,811
But we were not allowed to play with them.

53
00:05:53,878 --> 00:05:55,417
Because we were somezing better.

54
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:56,440
They're peasants.

55
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:57,525
They told us.

56
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,986
More than once I escaped.

57
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:02,698
Standing there for hours in ze field

58
00:06:02,723 --> 00:06:04,300
watching zese creatures

59
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:07,910
Now our studies come finally to an end.

60
00:06:08,355 --> 00:06:10,894
We got a beautiful female.

61
00:06:11,764 --> 00:06:12,935
And I'm sure

62
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,841
among zis town people

63
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,504
we will just find ze perfect...

64
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:19,479
'nasum'.

65
00:07:06,855 --> 00:07:08,042
Stop now.

66
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:10,814
Come on.

67
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:12,198
Let's go.

68
00:07:12,486 --> 00:07:14,070
Come on children. Go on, go on.

69
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:16,454
Ah! Baron.

70
00:07:18,914 --> 00:07:20,851
You wouldn't believe what a day I've had.

71
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:24,225
I had to remove the children from
the rotten school in town.

72
00:07:24,323 --> 00:07:25,907
It was you who choosed school, my dear.

73
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:28,219
Yes, I did like the school.
But I didn't know that those...

74
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:30,711
dirty little...
Tell me more about it at dinner.

75
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:33,892
At dinner...

76
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:35,207
Ohh!

77
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:37,964
Come on. Let's go.

78
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:41,637
Still got to be time for us.

79
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,238
Always running off
to that stupid laboratory.

80
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:23,768
What a mess in this room.

81
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,003
How' you keep your room this way?

82
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,415
I've told you that a hundred times.

83
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:29,111
What's the point of having beautiful things

84
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:31,039
if you children do just not care about it.

85
00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:32,703
Look at the dolls on the floor.

86
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:33,984
We shouldn't be doing this.

87
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,358
You know that.

88
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:38,396
Now, come on. Take your clothes of and

89
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,060
you put your play clothes on.

90
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:41,341
All right?

91
00:08:41,446 --> 00:08:42,157
Go ahead.

92
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:43,156
Now I must tell you something.

93
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:45,940
I'm very glad that you have left
that terrible school.

94
00:08:46,191 --> 00:08:48,799
The children at this school
are not on par with you.

95
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:51,236
You are very special.
You are different.

96
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:55,235
They are jealous and tell awful tales
about your mother and you father.

97
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:56,923
<i>Olga!</i>

98
00:08:57,796 --> 00:08:59,999
Mm. Some of things they say are true.

99
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:10,664
When they talk about your mother...

100
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,579
Sometimes they tell things
that are true.

101
00:09:13,604 --> 00:09:15,321
And sometimes they tell lies

102
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,329
because they are jealous.

103
00:09:16,354 --> 00:09:18,430
People who are jealous always tell lies.

104
00:09:18,594 --> 00:09:19,977
Give me the brush.

105
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,954
Madame.

106
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,134
Merci.

107
00:09:25,076 --> 00:09:26,639
I'm goin' to make you beautiful.

108
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:29,443
You will always have to surround yourself
with beautiful things.

109
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:32,372
I like the way you look.

110
00:09:32,964 --> 00:09:34,308
And your brother.

111
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,784
I've always...

112
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,214
looked for beauty.

113
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,743
That matter of fact...

114
00:09:38,768 --> 00:09:40,368
I insist on it.

115
00:11:32,382 --> 00:11:34,467
Liver and kidney are removed.

116
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:36,076
Did you put them in a storage bottle?

117
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:37,264
Yes I did.

118
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,208
Let's get rid of this useless krank.

119
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,724
Yes baron. Yes.

120
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:40,978
Ze children should be sent abroad.

121
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:43,766
Their education will progress
much faster there.

122
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,898
Absolutely not.
They will learn far more from us.

123
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:48,357
Besides, I don't want
them away from the house.

124
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:50,553
But it is only in
their own interest.

125
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,972
Mother and Father are coming
to visit us in a fortnight,

126
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:55,480
and they too, are against it.

127
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:56,969
You know that very well.

128
00:12:57,228 --> 00:12:58,102
Hmm...

129
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:00,273
Good God. I'm not looking forward
to their visit.

130
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:03,080
All they ever do is pry into our affairs.

131
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:05,229
Trying to arrange our lives.

132
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:06,135
Erich.

133
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,424
You should eat some soup.

134
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:08,835
What do you pick on the boy for?

135
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,108
Because he doesn't look
very strong to me lately.

136
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,764
Well, he looks very well to me.

137
00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:22,082
I was just thinking about a few years back.

138
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:24,635
On a trip I took with mother
to Saint Petersburg

139
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,120
to visit her brother.

140
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,040
When I met that beautiful
Russian ballet dancer...

141
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,619
who journeyed...

142
00:13:30,736 --> 00:13:32,392
after me to Monte Carlo.

143
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:33,428
As a matter of fact you were there.

144
00:13:33,453 --> 00:13:35,148
You remember you came
with father to the

145
00:13:35,173 --> 00:13:36,187
Hotel de París?

146
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:37,678
Yes I do.
- Mm.

147
00:13:38,323 --> 00:13:39,534
What happened then?

148
00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:41,917
Mother

149
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:43,472
took him for herself.

150
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:45,652
Mother is a very religious woman.

151
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,963
She was only acting in your own interest.

152
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:50,539
Religious woman?

153
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:53,909
Why must you always pick on mozer?

154
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:55,102
I don't pick on mother.

155
00:13:57,428 --> 00:13:58,732
I think she's very selfish.

156
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:01,903
She left you all ze jewelry,
didn't she?

157
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,864
Father left you all the property.

158
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:06,475
It was always like that in our family.

159
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:09,912
Father didn't like me very much either.

160
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:13,591
Now you have your pick on father.

161
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:15,578
Didn't he take you to Paris?

162
00:14:15,603 --> 00:14:17,051
Oh, you have to bring that up.

163
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,494
Do you know what I did?
I stayed

164
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:21,794
the entire trip

165
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,664
in my hotel suite
while he was out with some tramp.

166
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:26,696
I don't understand.

167
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:29,786
Why you have to discuss this all
in front of our children?

168
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,520
The children.

169
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:36,215
What am I going to do with them
now that they're out of school?

170
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,272
Why don't you take them to picnic tomorrow?

171
00:14:39,725 --> 00:14:41,388
Picnic?!

172
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:51,437
They got you diggin' another one
of these damn holes.

173
00:14:53,556 --> 00:14:54,917
Wonder what they put in 'em.

174
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,039
I don't know.

175
00:14:57,306 --> 00:14:58,734
I just dig them.

176
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:02,060
You know, I've been wantin'
to talk to you.

177
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:03,410
About what?

178
00:15:03,712 --> 00:15:04,828
Well...

179
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,934
Are you really serious?

180
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:09,452
About wantin' to be a...

181
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:11,293
Monk?

182
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,122
Yeah.

183
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:14,306
I am.

184
00:15:14,842 --> 00:15:16,125
I wanna live a

185
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:17,366
cloistered life.

186
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:20,277
You mean walk around in those clothes
- Yeah.

187
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,275
And pray all the time?
- I will do it.

188
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:24,874
I've never heard you pray.
I've never ever <i>seen</i> you pray.

189
00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:28,064
Now, all of a sudden, that's what you
wanna do for the rest of your life.

190
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:29,795
Monks work in the field.

191
00:15:29,851 --> 00:15:31,235
Just like we do.

192
00:15:31,702 --> 00:15:33,386
It's not a big difference.

193
00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:34,569
Yes, but...

194
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:35,897
Do you know what they eat?

195
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,247
Bread.

196
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:38,284
With water.

197
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:40,104
And that doesn't bother you?

198
00:15:40,392 --> 00:15:42,044
Not too much. It's okay.

199
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:43,995
I don't understand this.

200
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,558
We've been friends all our lives

201
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:47,566
If you really wanna
be a monk now,

202
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:48,762
that's up to you.

203
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,608
But you know what you are giving up?

204
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,494
It's okay.

205
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:55,138
You never come with me
when I go to see the girls in town.

206
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:56,399
Because...

207
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:57,983
I want to join the order.

208
00:15:58,576 --> 00:16:00,094
Why don't you come with me just once.

209
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:03,162
Don't worry. If you don't know
what to do, just watch me.

210
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:05,561
You'll get the idea.

211
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:10,318
Okay.

212
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,553
It's a problem with ze fallopian tube.

213
00:16:13,921 --> 00:16:16,477
I have to replace it,
to make it stronger.

214
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:19,679
What other parts
did you take away from that man?

215
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,074
These, Baron.

216
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:26,918
Perfect specimen.

217
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:36,087
Yes.

218
00:16:36,112 --> 00:16:37,726
Seminal vesicles.

219
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:39,680
But it's too long.

220
00:16:39,747 --> 00:16:41,454
We have to replace part of it.

221
00:16:42,614 --> 00:16:43,908
Prepare it now.

222
00:17:38,137 --> 00:17:40,124
What a hill to climb.

223
00:17:41,564 --> 00:17:42,567
Look!

224
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:44,364
The shepherds doesn't even care of the lambs.

225
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,313
How sweet.

226
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:47,493
Come on. Let's build a cover over here and

227
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,293
we'll have something to eat.

228
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:51,514
Go on.

229
00:17:53,232 --> 00:17:54,214
That's the idea.

230
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,993
No no no no.
The other way

231
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:58,648
Go ahead.

232
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:00,322
That's it.

233
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:03,078
Ohh!
My apples.

234
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:04,227
Ohh!

235
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:06,046
They're rolling all over the place.

236
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:07,386
Come on.

237
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:08,713
Help me pick the up.

238
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,753
Look. There's two over there.

239
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:18,961
What's been going on around here?

240
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:21,627
Put your clothes back on.

241
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,246
And get out of here,
you filthy whore!

242
00:18:30,887 --> 00:18:32,493
It's you again.

243
00:18:34,523 --> 00:18:35,985
I want to speak to you.

244
00:18:39,214 --> 00:18:41,379
Go back to the Barnes you...

245
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,398
And take your friends with you.

246
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,891
Come on up.

247
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:01,417
What's been going on at my property?

248
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:04,793
I want to know.

249
00:19:05,151 --> 00:19:06,780
Just watching after the sheep.

250
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:08,620
And the girl?

251
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,472
She was just passing by.

252
00:19:10,662 --> 00:19:12,647
How long have you been at her employ?

253
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:14,299
Short time.

254
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:15,739
And who employed you.

255
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:16,978
The foreman.

256
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,096
Hm. Yes.
I've seen you before.

257
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,471
You know I'm going to have to speak
to my husband about you.

258
00:19:26,272 --> 00:19:28,448
As a matter of fact I...

259
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:30,358
think I want to see
you tomorrow morning.

260
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,554
At the castle.

261
00:19:34,451 --> 00:19:35,991
Is that understood?

262
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,201
Yes.

263
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:43,032
Marika! Erik!

264
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:46,516
Let's move everything away from here.

265
00:19:48,932 --> 00:19:51,577
Some people don't know
how to behave themselves.

266
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:06,116
We have to find

267
00:20:06,141 --> 00:20:07,847
the right head for zis torso.

268
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:13,264
It has to be of a man who has strong way with women.

269
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:16,054
Who's overriding urges

270
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:17,604
are sensual.

271
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:20,929
If we succeed

272
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:22,949
In finding such a

273
00:20:23,272 --> 00:20:25,047
single minded man

274
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,855
our chances are very good...

275
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:29,477
That ze male we create...

276
00:20:30,078 --> 00:20:31,797
will fall in love with my

277
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,438
female zombie.

278
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:36,101
They will mate.

279
00:20:36,697 --> 00:20:38,939
And she will bear me the children I want.

280
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:41,662
They're going to be a...

281
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:43,246
true start...

282
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,077
of a new race.

283
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,698
Entirely created by me.

284
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:51,352
Responding only to my bidding.

285
00:20:58,214 --> 00:20:59,375
But so far...

286
00:20:59,443 --> 00:21:02,177
we have not find a suitable mate for her.

287
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:15,943
I know where to find such a man.

288
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:18,520
I've been once to a house in town.

289
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:20,127
Certain kind of house.

290
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:21,921
You mean a bordello, Baron?

291
00:21:21,946 --> 00:21:23,438
- Yes.
You, Baron?

292
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:26,038
Yes, Why?!
You zink I've never been to one?

293
00:21:26,063 --> 00:21:27,233
Ohh...

294
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:31,205
While I was in medical school.

295
00:21:31,854 --> 00:21:33,047
Most of ze boys

296
00:21:33,072 --> 00:21:34,676
used to go to such a place.

297
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:37,076
They always wanted me to go with them.

298
00:21:37,284 --> 00:21:39,783
Knowing what kind of good student I was.

299
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,862
Never leaving my books.

300
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:43,513
Not even for one hour.

301
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,448
And still I was foolish enough...

302
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:48,969
to want to be accepted in their company.

303
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:51,510
Once I left my books,
and I went wiz them.

304
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:52,803
What happened?

305
00:21:53,082 --> 00:21:54,868
It was terrible.

306
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:56,966
All these over developed women.

307
00:21:56,991 --> 00:21:58,624
With their large breasts.

308
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:00,253
And shapeless.

309
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,511
And this kind of women
is supposed to give you pleasure.

310
00:22:03,981 --> 00:22:06,057
With their filthy movement.

311
00:22:06,504 --> 00:22:08,144
And dirty talk.

312
00:22:08,586 --> 00:22:10,629
How zis woman even can compare

313
00:22:10,707 --> 00:22:12,871
with a beautiful creation like mine?

314
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:15,034
Or even with my sister.

315
00:22:17,325 --> 00:22:18,552
To find...

316
00:22:18,577 --> 00:22:21,141
a man who likes to make love to anyzing...

317
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:23,751
we have to go to such a place.

318
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,103
Who's there?

319
00:23:13,944 --> 00:23:15,227
It's you. Come...

320
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:19,467
Hi Biba.

321
00:23:19,723 --> 00:23:21,208
Sonja!
- Yeah.

322
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:23,718
Sonja, this is my friend Sacha.

323
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:27,317
He's new here.

324
00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:30,453
Why don't we show him a good time?

325
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:48,148
Are you sure it is in
zis part of town, Baron?

326
00:23:48,237 --> 00:23:49,175
Of course.

327
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,265
I remember well from my schooldays.

328
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,650
Just outside.

329
00:23:52,884 --> 00:23:54,614
Can we go in, Baron?

330
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,992
To go in?
To do what?

331
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,236
You filthy zing.

332
00:23:58,261 --> 00:23:59,754
Of course not.

333
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:01,796
Excuse me, Baron...

334
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:02,755
Excuse me.

335
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,882
It's all right Otto.

336
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:05,542
We'll wait outside.

337
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:41,429
Why have you never come here before?

338
00:24:43,303 --> 00:24:44,743
I work too much.

339
00:24:46,462 --> 00:24:47,665
You like?

340
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:19,085
It's one of zose doors.

341
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,577
We watch.

342
00:25:22,823 --> 00:25:24,709
Who goes in or out.

343
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:54,002
Could they be beating someone?

344
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:55,688
They like strange zings.

345
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,484
<i>Let me go from here...</i>

346
00:26:06,463 --> 00:26:07,544
No!

347
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:08,337
No!

348
00:26:08,493 --> 00:26:09,453
No!

349
00:26:10,415 --> 00:26:11,263
No!

350
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:12,870
No!

351
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:24,909
Two girls...?

352
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:26,494
One man...?

353
00:26:26,828 --> 00:26:28,513
He must be very powerful.

354
00:26:29,614 --> 00:26:31,154
Look at his head.

355
00:26:32,727 --> 00:26:33,999
That's him.

356
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:36,365
That's the man we want.

357
00:26:36,611 --> 00:26:38,061
It's okay. Come in.

358
00:26:52,976 --> 00:26:54,617
Let's go and get ze equipment.

359
00:26:54,642 --> 00:26:55,490
And we come back.

360
00:26:55,515 --> 00:26:57,177
And wait for him tonight.

361
00:27:05,195 --> 00:27:06,646
Come, Erik.

362
00:27:06,724 --> 00:27:07,862
Come.

363
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:10,072
Come.

364
00:27:16,138 --> 00:27:18,492
It's good to see
the children are already in bed.

365
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,602
We've had quite a day at the picnic.

366
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:24,035
Olga, you've been very overworked.

367
00:27:24,373 --> 00:27:25,880
And you'll be far more than that.

368
00:27:25,905 --> 00:27:28,020
Because now the children
are your entire responsibility

369
00:27:28,044 --> 00:27:30,184
and I think we can do something about it.

370
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:32,055
Come say goodnight to mother.

371
00:27:39,318 --> 00:27:42,075
Tomorrow morning I'm expecting a visitor.

372
00:27:42,823 --> 00:27:46,451
I would like you to prepare an especially nice breakfast.

373
00:27:47,388 --> 00:27:48,470
For two.

374
00:29:10,223 --> 00:29:11,350
That's him.

375
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,733
There he comes.

376
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,110
But he's not alone.

377
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:16,896
He is wiz somebody.

378
00:29:16,998 --> 00:29:18,638
He's helping somebody.

379
00:29:19,832 --> 00:29:21,685
Somebody who looks very drunk.

380
00:29:23,782 --> 00:29:25,715
You get rid of ze drunk, Von Otto.

381
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,412
Yes, Baron, Yes.

382
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:30,435
And leave ze Serbian to me.

383
00:29:46,216 --> 00:29:47,299
Get down.

384
00:30:38,222 --> 00:30:40,108
It's just what I wanted.

385
00:30:41,794 --> 00:30:43,110
It's magnificent.

386
00:30:43,146 --> 00:30:44,973
I knew we would find it.

387
00:30:45,253 --> 00:30:46,190
Otto!

388
00:30:46,215 --> 00:30:47,172
Look at it.

389
00:30:47,197 --> 00:30:50,011
Finally we found the right head
wiz ze perfect nasum.

390
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,610
For my male zombie.

391
00:32:07,353 --> 00:32:10,041
Preparation for the operation
are almost complete.

392
00:32:11,642 --> 00:32:13,817
I hardly can wait for ze results.

393
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,793
I feel certain Baron.

394
00:32:15,871 --> 00:32:18,347
That with your meticulous efforts we have...

395
00:32:18,515 --> 00:32:19,876
You have made it.

396
00:32:19,903 --> 00:32:21,733
Everything will be successful.

397
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:24,578
Soon here in Serbia, in my laboratory...

398
00:32:24,935 --> 00:32:27,212
perfection will become a reality.

399
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:30,043
Yes, yes. That's right.

400
00:32:30,411 --> 00:32:32,698
Ze true embodiment of servant youz...

401
00:32:32,723 --> 00:32:34,399
will find expression.

402
00:32:35,046 --> 00:32:36,843
My work is a continuation

403
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,873
Of ze unfinished business

404
00:32:39,018 --> 00:32:40,614
of men on earth.

405
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:43,392
A furzer refinement.

406
00:32:43,992 --> 00:32:45,890
But zis time it must cost a life.

407
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,924
Your hands are miracle workers baron.

408
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,346
This is a threshold, Otto...

409
00:32:52,005 --> 00:32:55,765
of a creation that will replace
ze worn out thrash...

410
00:32:56,334 --> 00:32:59,871
that now populates
and repopulates that planet.

411
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:05,216
Their loyalty will be to me only.

412
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:08,363
I will be ze object of their allegiance.

413
00:33:11,354 --> 00:33:12,804
Listen to ze heart.

414
00:33:57,589 --> 00:33:58,806
Come in.

415
00:34:07,918 --> 00:34:09,704
You wanted to see me ma'am?

416
00:34:15,479 --> 00:34:16,562
Yes.

417
00:34:24,807 --> 00:34:28,411
I'm not in the habit of conducting
business in bed young man.

418
00:34:29,393 --> 00:34:31,022
However, this morning when I...

419
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:33,731
came out of bed I didn't feel
too well, so I went back to it.

420
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:40,127
We've been discussing you,
my husband and I.

421
00:34:40,616 --> 00:34:45,080
And we think that your behaviour
on our property is disgusting.

422
00:34:46,642 --> 00:34:48,505
You are acting like an animal.

423
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:52,986
And we are seriously considering
dismissing you.

424
00:34:56,211 --> 00:34:57,873
I just came to say goodbye.

425
00:34:57,898 --> 00:34:59,015
Collect my pay.

426
00:34:59,284 --> 00:35:00,802
I have to be leaving anyway.

427
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,063
Leaving?

428
00:35:02,754 --> 00:35:05,019
Well, it's.. sort of sudden.

429
00:35:05,822 --> 00:35:07,005
You seem to be Ehh...

430
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,501
enjoying yourself...

431
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,687
yesterday afternoon to say the least.

432
00:35:11,455 --> 00:35:12,537
What is it?

433
00:35:12,562 --> 00:35:13,809
Is it that girl I saw you with.

434
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:15,673
Is that your sweetheart?

435
00:35:15,841 --> 00:35:17,413
No, she's just a nice girl.

436
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,963
Well then, what is it, because

437
00:35:18,988 --> 00:35:21,522
had I known you would be the person
to do me this kind of trouble

438
00:35:21,547 --> 00:35:23,642
I would not be here wasting my time

439
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:24,914
and trying to

440
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:26,945
offer you chance to better yourself.

441
00:35:27,055 --> 00:35:29,130
To give a position in this household.

442
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:30,904
I'm sorry. It's my friend.

443
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,058
Oh, your friends. You've been telling
your friends you were coming up here

444
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:36,838
so that they've been running their
tasteless little stories about me.

445
00:35:37,128 --> 00:35:41,569
I never thought that these idiots
could interfere with my business.

446
00:35:42,053 --> 00:35:44,362
No, you don't understand.
It happened last night.

447
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,242
I'm listening.

448
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,795
Well, me and my friend... I had been
drinking and we had been walking home.

449
00:35:51,454 --> 00:35:53,417
And somebody hit me
on the back of the neck.

450
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,674
And dragged my friend into the bushes
and cut off his head.

451
00:35:57,778 --> 00:35:58,894
It's a nightmare.

452
00:35:58,919 --> 00:36:01,070
No. It's not a nightmare
because I woke up this morning

453
00:36:01,095 --> 00:36:03,257
and there was my friend.
He had his head cut off.

454
00:36:03,431 --> 00:36:05,597
I had to bury him
by the side of the road.

455
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:07,593
Why didn't...
didn't they harm you.

456
00:36:07,794 --> 00:36:09,022
I don't know.

457
00:36:10,355 --> 00:36:12,174
That's a very unusual story.

458
00:36:12,821 --> 00:36:14,651
Have you told anyone
you were coming up here.

459
00:36:15,098 --> 00:36:16,761
No.
- well then...

460
00:36:17,028 --> 00:36:18,210
You're perfectly safe here.

461
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:20,309
There's no one to spy on you.

462
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:24,114
No one knows what goes on in this house.

463
00:36:26,524 --> 00:36:28,654
Besides, with murderers
lurking around

464
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:31,277
I'm going to need some kind
of protection.

465
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:35,930
I'm sure that if you'd been
sober last night you would've...

466
00:36:36,856 --> 00:36:38,563
Helped you friend.
You look...

467
00:36:39,222 --> 00:36:40,494
strong.

468
00:36:45,934 --> 00:36:47,262
You are strong.

469
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:48,445
Yes ma'am.

470
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,630
And very good looking.

471
00:36:55,749 --> 00:36:56,898
Yes ma'am.

472
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:03,450
My husband does not love me.

473
00:37:03,787 --> 00:37:05,458
It's a marriage in name only.

474
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:09,469
For the children.
For the.. property

475
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:12,192
Yes ma'am.

476
00:37:12,612 --> 00:37:14,364
From time to time I...

477
00:37:14,788 --> 00:37:16,552
I need someone up here.

478
00:37:19,854 --> 00:37:21,182
Very lonely.

479
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:23,871
So...

480
00:37:24,686 --> 00:37:26,840
happy they did not harm you.

481
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,725
You want me to stop work now?

482
00:37:30,788 --> 00:37:32,116
Yes.

483
00:37:57,629 --> 00:37:59,114
Beautiful.

484
00:37:59,371 --> 00:38:03,309
We were very fortunate
to find such a perfect torso in one piece.

485
00:38:05,128 --> 00:38:06,421
Incision.

486
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:07,692
It's superb.

487
00:38:08,073 --> 00:38:09,691
No sign of contusion.

488
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,116
Ready?!

489
00:38:16,523 --> 00:38:19,636
I go in to her digestive parts.

490
00:40:35,192 --> 00:40:36,308
Separate...

491
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,380
Spleens.

492
00:40:53,373 --> 00:40:54,545
Kidneys...

493
00:40:57,859 --> 00:40:59,343
Gallbladder...

494
00:41:06,348 --> 00:41:07,463
Liver...

495
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:02,942
Remarkable.

496
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:08,122
After what you went through last night.

497
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,335
What would be my other duties
while in the house?

498
00:42:54,594 --> 00:42:57,128
Well, Olga is to have
full care of the children.

499
00:42:58,287 --> 00:43:00,531
So as of tonight,
you can start serving dinner.

500
00:43:00,776 --> 00:43:01,881
Alright.

501
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,056
By the way...

502
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,593
We have in the castle the most
modern available plumbing facilities.

503
00:43:09,066 --> 00:43:11,287
And I want you to take full use of them.

504
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:13,199
Every single day.

505
00:43:15,475 --> 00:43:16,692
Do you understand?

506
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:17,796
Yes ma'am.

507
00:43:37,684 --> 00:43:38,800
Otto!

508
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:43,130
Level the table.

509
00:43:51,452 --> 00:43:53,002
Soon I will give you life.

510
00:43:53,027 --> 00:43:54,129
New life.

511
00:43:57,517 --> 00:43:58,856
Why are you looking at me.

512
00:43:58,923 --> 00:44:01,445
You filthy zing.
Turn around.

513
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:08,193
My male zombie

514
00:44:08,218 --> 00:44:09,522
is almost created.

515
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,050
I only need ze blood

516
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:12,534
Maybe tonight

517
00:44:14,273 --> 00:44:16,840
Soon you will give me
ze right children.

518
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,138
Ze children I want.

519
00:45:02,255 --> 00:45:03,348
Otto!

520
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,278
Otto!

521
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:09,284
Help me down.

522
00:45:34,995 --> 00:45:36,636
To know death, Otto...

523
00:45:38,044 --> 00:45:39,886
you have to fuck life...

524
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,839
in ze gallbladder.

525
00:45:53,028 --> 00:45:54,836
I wonder if your father is home.

526
00:45:55,662 --> 00:45:57,157
Why don't you go and look.

527
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,320
Wanna go to the castle?

528
00:46:26,988 --> 00:46:28,482
I'm glad I finally found you.

529
00:46:28,507 --> 00:46:30,079
I've been looking for you everywhere.

530
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:31,831
But you know that I am always here.

531
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:33,017
Well, you're not always here.

532
00:46:33,042 --> 00:46:35,941
You could be at the lab, you could
be outside. You could be many places.

533
00:46:36,866 --> 00:46:38,126
Anyway I found you.

534
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:40,157
It's what I wanted.
I have to speak with you.

535
00:46:40,182 --> 00:46:41,329
About what?

536
00:46:41,473 --> 00:46:43,693
There will be a new person
working around the castle

537
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:45,591
and I don't want you to be alarmed.

538
00:46:45,616 --> 00:46:46,908
What do you mean?

539
00:46:46,933 --> 00:46:49,546
Well, you are very busy,
the children are out of school...

540
00:46:49,571 --> 00:46:51,388
Olga is overworked.

541
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,746
So I took it upon myself
to hire a new servant.

542
00:46:55,114 --> 00:46:57,691
But how did you find
so quickly another girl?

543
00:46:57,855 --> 00:47:01,170
It is not a girl.
It is a.. man-servant.

544
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:03,880
A man?
Why not a girl?

545
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:05,990
You know girls around here.

546
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,571
They're such trash.
And all they want to do is...

547
00:47:09,596 --> 00:47:12,684
steal my jewelry and put on my clothes.

548
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:15,861
So I adjust for a man.

549
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:17,768
Kathrine...

550
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,397
I zought we had an agreement.

551
00:47:19,459 --> 00:47:22,706
That no man is working in ze castle,
disturbing my work.

552
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,807
He won't be disturbing you.

553
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:27,122
I've seen him work.

554
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:29,632
And I'll keep him very busy.

555
00:47:30,324 --> 00:47:31,440
I hope so.

556
00:47:31,653 --> 00:47:32,947
You can be sure of it.

557
00:47:51,784 --> 00:47:53,178
Where is your husband?

558
00:47:54,451 --> 00:47:56,850
He's busy working.
He works very hard.

559
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:59,158
He's a very intelligent man.

560
00:47:59,422 --> 00:48:00,917
You can meet him tonight at dinner.

561
00:48:02,156 --> 00:48:03,851
Does he mind you being with men?

562
00:48:03,973 --> 00:48:05,392
I mean, he could get me
in a lot of trouble.

563
00:48:05,417 --> 00:48:06,507
Have me arrested.

564
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,129
Why should he?

565
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:10,953
He has his work
and I have my privacy.

566
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,373
We have two children.

567
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:16,443
You.. saw the children
the first time we met.

568
00:48:18,836 --> 00:48:20,432
Did you find them beautiful?

569
00:48:21,772 --> 00:48:22,876
Yeah.

570
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:26,068
It's the only reason
my husband and I are together.

571
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:29,707
To bring them up right.

572
00:48:45,546 --> 00:48:47,198
No one has come as close as I.

573
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:49,706
Understanding the secret of life.

574
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,492
Intelligently created.

575
00:48:51,827 --> 00:48:53,199
My mistakes have been few.

576
00:48:53,224 --> 00:48:54,984
But I learned from everyone.

577
00:49:01,932 --> 00:49:04,197
Let us make certain that ze electrodes

578
00:49:04,222 --> 00:49:06,474
are placed precise as always.

579
00:49:07,143 --> 00:49:09,330
At ze critical energy point.

580
00:49:10,237 --> 00:49:11,375
Apply electricity.

581
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,501
Yes Baron.

582
00:49:17,066 --> 00:49:18,304
Now, start by hand.

583
00:49:18,329 --> 00:49:19,721
I'll handle the brain area.

584
00:49:33,953 --> 00:49:35,393
They move Otto.

585
00:49:35,582 --> 00:49:36,855
Stop ze electricity.

586
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,981
Yes...

587
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:39,845
And let him down.

588
00:49:51,041 --> 00:49:53,027
Otto, what we're seeing in front of us...

589
00:49:53,383 --> 00:49:54,511
Is really incredible.

590
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:55,693
It is Baron!

591
00:49:55,972 --> 00:49:57,422
Let's see if they can move.

592
00:49:59,922 --> 00:50:01,139
Arm.

593
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:12,365
Arm.

594
00:50:18,484 --> 00:50:19,522
Head!

595
00:50:23,204 --> 00:50:24,208
Head!

596
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,219
Look how natural they are.

597
00:50:27,832 --> 00:50:29,874
Look. Their reflex function beautifully.

598
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,211
How super.

599
00:50:32,477 --> 00:50:35,536
Even my own expectations
completely rewarded.

600
00:50:35,714 --> 00:50:37,165
He is so happy for you Baron.

601
00:50:37,232 --> 00:50:38,927
I'm fulfilled.

602
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:40,335
But not yet.

603
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,689
We have to wait for ze final triumph.

604
00:50:42,878 --> 00:50:44,966
Ze breeding.. and then...

605
00:50:45,077 --> 00:50:46,339
the children.

606
00:50:46,475 --> 00:50:48,248
If there will be only some way

607
00:50:48,405 --> 00:50:49,588
to reduce it,

608
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,016
the gestation period.

609
00:50:51,254 --> 00:50:53,451
How can I wait
for nine months from tonight?

610
00:50:53,709 --> 00:50:55,584
Till she'll bear me ze first child.

611
00:50:56,209 --> 00:50:57,402
I must...

612
00:50:57,658 --> 00:50:59,477
There is even somezings

613
00:50:59,604 --> 00:51:01,534
Science cannot modify.

614
00:51:01,758 --> 00:51:04,391
The honor you do me
to share zis incredible triumph...

615
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:07,024
is more Zan I deserve Baron.

616
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:09,685
I take them to table.

617
00:51:34,262 --> 00:51:36,539
Do you approve
of my new servant, Baron?

618
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:41,460
You are not the only one wiz introductions
to make this evening, my dear.

619
00:51:42,802 --> 00:51:43,706
Otto!

620
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:44,811
Yes Baron

621
00:51:47,132 --> 00:51:49,129
Show my new guests to ze table.

622
00:51:49,274 --> 00:51:50,501
Yes Baron.

623
00:52:51,185 --> 00:52:53,138
A very handsome pair, Baron.

624
00:52:55,748 --> 00:52:58,169
They're assisting me
in my laboratory work.

625
00:52:58,794 --> 00:53:01,428
They have some interest
in medical problems.

626
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:03,983
Quite obvious.

627
00:53:06,994 --> 00:53:09,806
Had I known you were so generous
in having couples...

628
00:53:09,831 --> 00:53:13,120
I would not have been so modest
at my own acquisition.

629
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:32,950
Thank you, Nicholas.

630
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:47,055
Are you from the town?

631
00:53:52,692 --> 00:53:54,031
I see...

632
00:53:56,854 --> 00:53:59,197
Could they have been
in some kind of accident, Baron?

633
00:53:59,376 --> 00:54:00,436
Not really.

634
00:54:07,306 --> 00:54:09,314
No. I don't want them to eat.

635
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,357
They are not ready yet to eat solid food.

636
00:54:26,907 --> 00:54:28,245
Come here.

637
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,668
There is somezing very intriguing
about your new man, my dear.

638
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:37,684
Especially to my guests.

639
00:55:15,976 --> 00:55:17,560
What was going on down there?

640
00:55:20,606 --> 00:55:22,815
Do you know these eh...
two new people?

641
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:26,208
I didn't know that girl.

642
00:55:26,632 --> 00:55:28,495
The man was my friend.

643
00:55:29,332 --> 00:55:31,006
The one that was killed last night.

644
00:55:31,419 --> 00:55:33,326
Well, there you see.
It was a nightmare.

645
00:55:33,834 --> 00:55:35,687
Should've gone and speak to him.

646
00:55:36,029 --> 00:55:37,201
After all...

647
00:55:37,226 --> 00:55:39,488
We're not <i>that</i> strict with our help.

648
00:55:44,629 --> 00:55:46,035
It wasn't...

649
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,578
exactly him.

650
00:55:49,857 --> 00:55:51,442
Well, now you talk nonsense.

651
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:54,555
How could it be not exactly him
if it is him?

652
00:55:55,082 --> 00:55:57,536
My friend wasn't tall.
He was about my size.

653
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,213
It was my friends head
but it wasn't his body.

654
00:56:00,238 --> 00:56:02,134
You saw how tall
that person was.

655
00:56:03,042 --> 00:56:05,007
Well, he was extremely tall.

656
00:56:06,123 --> 00:56:07,963
What kind of work
did you say husband does?

657
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:10,686
He's a scholar.
Spends hours in his laboratory.

658
00:56:11,378 --> 00:56:13,498
But I really don't know
what he really does, we...

659
00:56:13,523 --> 00:56:15,451
lead very separate lives.

660
00:56:16,322 --> 00:56:18,028
You must know what he does.

661
00:56:18,464 --> 00:56:20,149
You see him every night at dinner.

662
00:56:20,316 --> 00:56:21,466
Talk to 'em.

663
00:56:21,491 --> 00:56:23,820
A word or a phrase now and then...

664
00:56:26,407 --> 00:56:28,638
Something to do with electrical energy.

665
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:30,379
But where does he work?

666
00:56:30,404 --> 00:56:32,521
In his laboratory
on the other side of the castle.

667
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,818
No one has access to it.

668
00:56:34,843 --> 00:56:37,274
He had it build seven years ago
with privacy in mind.

669
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:39,717
Only he and his assistant,

670
00:56:39,742 --> 00:56:43,154
you know, that strange little creature
that's always around him,

671
00:56:43,866 --> 00:56:45,641
are able to go into it.

672
00:56:45,991 --> 00:56:47,407
I should see this laboratory.

673
00:56:47,432 --> 00:56:49,048
It's the only way I'll find out
what happened to my friend.

674
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:50,164
Mm hm.
You can't go.

675
00:56:51,346 --> 00:56:52,561
No way.

676
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,315
Forget about your friend.

677
00:56:55,129 --> 00:56:56,948
You saw him at the dinner table tonight.

678
00:56:57,172 --> 00:56:58,666
I can't forget about him.

679
00:56:59,057 --> 00:57:00,441
You'll have to.

680
00:57:02,384 --> 00:57:05,163
Besides you can't go wandering
about the castle by yourself.

681
00:57:07,628 --> 00:57:09,637
We have.. better things to do.

682
01:01:03,385 --> 01:01:06,320
Why, Otto, do they seem so
interested in my wife's new servant.

683
01:01:06,345 --> 01:01:08,462
He must have some quality
that attracts them.

684
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:10,516
He looks familiar to me baron.

685
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:12,666
Why shouldn't he.
They all look ze same.

686
01:01:12,978 --> 01:01:14,886
Except my Serbian.

687
01:01:15,155 --> 01:01:17,531
He is a true aristocrat of his kind.

688
01:01:17,654 --> 01:01:19,607
He is unusual, Baron.

689
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:22,333
I always look for
ze noble ideals

690
01:01:22,358 --> 01:01:24,874
and artifacts of ancient
civilizations.

691
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,146
My sister and I are very much alike.

692
01:01:28,448 --> 01:01:29,631
But she...

693
01:01:29,656 --> 01:01:32,807
somehow likes to keep her nose
always in ze gutter.

694
01:01:33,287 --> 01:01:34,671
Jah, jah...

695
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:07,722
You see how he's all strapped up?

696
01:03:11,071 --> 01:03:12,967
And they're gonna blame me for it too.

697
01:03:24,658 --> 01:03:26,946
You really have to help me
get into the laboratory.

698
01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:11,141
What are you doing
in zis part of ze castle?

699
01:05:11,308 --> 01:05:13,282
Didn't my wife tell you
never to work around here?

700
01:05:13,372 --> 01:05:14,410
No she didn't.

701
01:05:14,435 --> 01:05:16,341
I don't want anybody in zis section.

702
01:05:16,664 --> 01:05:18,348
If you have ze habit
of doing zings on your own

703
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:20,359
you won't have
your job much longer.

704
01:05:20,822 --> 01:05:22,540
I wasn't planning on keeping it anyway.

705
01:05:22,641 --> 01:05:24,348
Why? Are you going back
to ze farm?

706
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:25,475
Maybe.

707
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,550
Perhaps that's where you belong.

708
01:05:27,575 --> 01:05:28,711
Yeah.

709
01:06:06,815 --> 01:06:07,885
Otto!

710
01:06:08,867 --> 01:06:09,916
Otto!

711
01:06:12,418 --> 01:06:14,963
Where are you?!
- Yes Baron.

712
01:06:17,317 --> 01:06:18,288
Come in.

713
01:06:18,313 --> 01:06:19,404
What happened?

714
01:06:19,429 --> 01:06:20,475
I don't know, Baron.

715
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,907
Did you drop it?
- No, Baron, no.

716
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:25,999
It didn't fall by itself.

717
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,583
I heard no one Baron.

718
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:29,659
But I clean it for you immediately.

719
01:06:37,461 --> 01:06:40,106
I can't go that way.
He saw me and made me go back.

720
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:42,249
Is there another way
we can go to get there?

721
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,027
Let's hurry.

722
01:06:57,327 --> 01:06:59,374
Ze medical profession
would love to claim

723
01:06:59,399 --> 01:07:02,801
<i>my</i> achievement as
part of their own.

724
01:07:02,933 --> 01:07:05,310
And call it a giant stride forwards

725
01:07:05,335 --> 01:07:06,672
of medicine.

726
01:07:06,907 --> 01:07:08,122
But they can't.

727
01:07:08,247 --> 01:07:10,870
It is a giant stride forwards for me!

728
01:07:11,573 --> 01:07:13,838
Now her beauty will be appreciated.

729
01:07:18,774 --> 01:07:20,058
Let her down.

730
01:07:26,419 --> 01:07:27,868
Let him rise too.

731
01:07:31,501 --> 01:07:34,927
The brain is controlling
zis massive and powerful body.

732
01:07:35,629 --> 01:07:37,548
Never since Adam and Eve...

733
01:07:37,573 --> 01:07:40,183
history has occurred such a moment

734
01:07:41,971 --> 01:07:43,555
Watch his eyes.

735
01:07:43,689 --> 01:07:46,099
When he sees her womanly perfection.

736
01:07:46,914 --> 01:07:49,960
I'm sure he's never seen anyone
as beautiful as this.

737
01:07:50,899 --> 01:07:51,937
Come.

738
01:07:51,962 --> 01:07:53,632
Bring them close.

739
01:07:58,316 --> 01:07:59,600
Kiss him.

740
01:08:05,313 --> 01:08:06,530
Kiss him.

741
01:08:09,737 --> 01:08:10,842
Kiss him!

742
01:08:13,185 --> 01:08:14,312
Kiss him!

743
01:08:16,788 --> 01:08:17,970
Kiss him.

744
01:08:22,106 --> 01:08:23,288
What are you waiting for?

745
01:08:23,488 --> 01:08:24,526
She's yours!

746
01:08:24,664 --> 01:08:25,889
Touch her!

747
01:08:26,849 --> 01:08:28,098
Kiss him!

748
01:08:32,265 --> 01:08:33,413
Kiss him!

749
01:08:35,366 --> 01:08:36,561
Can it be?

750
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:39,518
Could it be possible that we have failed?

751
01:08:40,271 --> 01:08:42,224
Somebody must have tampered with them.

752
01:08:42,249 --> 01:08:44,067
Somebody must have been in ze laboratory.

753
01:08:44,746 --> 01:08:46,029
Kiss him!

754
01:08:50,395 --> 01:08:51,221
Otto.

755
01:08:51,246 --> 01:08:52,413
It can't be true.

756
01:08:53,051 --> 01:08:55,138
Somebody disturbed our work.

757
01:08:57,805 --> 01:08:59,222
What are you waiting for?

758
01:08:59,247 --> 01:09:00,360
Kiss him!

759
01:09:04,489 --> 01:09:05,617
Doesn't work.

760
01:09:05,717 --> 01:09:07,014
Put them back!

761
01:09:13,534 --> 01:09:14,840
Get them dressed.

762
01:09:14,865 --> 01:09:16,483
And ready to leave.

763
01:09:24,403 --> 01:09:25,407
Wake up.

764
01:09:25,432 --> 01:09:26,958
Come on. Wake up!

765
01:09:26,983 --> 01:09:28,040
What is it?

766
01:09:28,065 --> 01:09:29,625
What are you doing here?

767
01:09:29,892 --> 01:09:31,678
I just had a look
at your husbands work.

768
01:09:31,848 --> 01:09:33,072
What work?

769
01:09:33,407 --> 01:09:35,413
The laboratory. His butcher shop.

770
01:09:35,581 --> 01:09:36,976
How did you get there?

771
01:09:37,001 --> 01:09:38,093
Your children.

772
01:09:38,118 --> 01:09:39,979
They showed me.
They knew the way.

773
01:09:40,004 --> 01:09:41,911
How dare you?

774
01:09:42,393 --> 01:09:45,284
How dare you wake me
up in the middle of the day

775
01:09:45,309 --> 01:09:46,792
when you know
I have insomnia.

776
01:09:47,828 --> 01:09:50,495
How dare you spy
on the Baron's work.

777
01:09:50,655 --> 01:09:53,411
Since when is the lower class

778
01:09:53,436 --> 01:09:55,399
allowed such presumption.

779
01:09:56,089 --> 01:09:57,851
Your husband has
my friend and the girl

780
01:09:57,876 --> 01:10:00,498
in that laboratory of his and
does experiments on them.

781
01:10:00,898 --> 01:10:03,989
The girl is unconscious and my friend
is so weak he can hardly move.

782
01:10:04,357 --> 01:10:07,125
The Baron was once a student in medicine

783
01:10:07,192 --> 01:10:09,970
and perhaps those friends
of yours are sick.

784
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:11,745
And in need of help.

785
01:10:11,910 --> 01:10:14,063
Sometimes when the Baron finds...

786
01:10:14,088 --> 01:10:16,395
people, that interest him enough...

787
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,062
and that are sick enough, he treats them.
Like his servant.

788
01:10:19,263 --> 01:10:21,164
That servant owes his life to him.

789
01:10:21,232 --> 01:10:21,957
Okay.

790
01:10:21,982 --> 01:10:25,126
I just came up here to tell you in case
you didn't know and wanted to escape.

791
01:10:26,364 --> 01:10:27,848
Escape?

792
01:10:28,038 --> 01:10:29,734
Escape from what?

793
01:10:29,821 --> 01:10:31,774
This is my life. This is my house.

794
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:33,369
I'm not imprisoned.

795
01:10:33,394 --> 01:10:35,947
Do not interfere with the Baron's work.

796
01:10:39,763 --> 01:10:41,471
Please do not interfere

797
01:10:41,683 --> 01:10:43,724
Things that seems strange to you

798
01:10:43,749 --> 01:10:46,325
are very well planned by the Baron.

799
01:10:46,559 --> 01:10:48,054
He knows what he's doing.

800
01:10:48,779 --> 01:10:49,918
So do I.

801
01:10:50,033 --> 01:10:51,852
And I'm not gonna let it continue.

802
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,351
How dare you speak to me this way?

803
01:10:54,376 --> 01:10:56,283
You're not gonna let what continue?!

804
01:10:56,308 --> 01:10:58,469
How dare you contradict me?

805
01:10:58,574 --> 01:11:00,750
Who are you?
You nothing!

806
01:11:00,773 --> 01:11:02,401
You lowlife.

807
01:11:02,426 --> 01:11:03,763
You scum!

808
01:11:03,788 --> 01:11:04,935
You bitch!

809
01:11:09,090 --> 01:11:11,612
You Filth! You farmer!

810
01:11:13,868 --> 01:11:16,759
How dare you walk out on me?

811
01:11:18,365 --> 01:11:20,619
Somezing went wrong.
- But what?

812
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:22,471
Maybe ze mixture of the blood wasn't right

813
01:11:22,496 --> 01:11:24,709
You were ze only one
who knew about it.

814
01:11:25,923 --> 01:11:28,491
But maybe someone
got into ze laboratory.

815
01:11:28,535 --> 01:11:30,321
But Who Baron?

816
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:32,471
The Children?
But they wouldn't do it.

817
01:11:33,108 --> 01:11:34,480
My sister?

818
01:11:34,614 --> 01:11:37,861
My sister. She always
was very jealous of me. <i>Always!</i>

819
01:11:38,602 --> 01:11:40,288
But we failed...

820
01:11:40,332 --> 01:11:42,462
that beautiful serbian female.

821
01:11:42,586 --> 01:11:44,628
Everybody would have jumped.
<i>Everyone!</i>

822
01:11:45,052 --> 01:11:46,737
But maybe that head of that...

823
01:11:46,827 --> 01:11:48,823
<i>creature</i> wasn't any good!

824
01:11:49,276 --> 01:11:51,017
His perfect nose...

825
01:11:51,263 --> 01:11:52,801
His perfect nose!

826
01:11:52,869 --> 01:11:55,502
He had the perfect brain.
He was the king I wanted.

827
01:11:55,614 --> 01:11:56,909
<i>And we failed!</i>

828
01:11:57,657 --> 01:11:59,085
We have to try it again.

829
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:00,637
Otto, we have to try it again.

830
01:12:01,003 --> 01:12:03,111
I'm going to prove that we can do it.

831
01:12:03,186 --> 01:12:04,559
We wait for so long.

832
01:12:09,044 --> 01:12:10,540
You must help me Erik.

833
01:12:11,391 --> 01:12:12,975
Somebody's spying on me.

834
01:12:13,477 --> 01:12:16,446
Somebody gets into ze laboratory,
talking to my experiments.

835
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:18,476
I don't like that.

836
01:12:19,206 --> 01:12:21,316
You know anybody who
could to ze laboratory?

837
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:22,979
Take anyzing away from there?

838
01:12:24,406 --> 01:12:25,411
No.

839
01:12:25,589 --> 01:12:27,988
But tell me about ze new servant of mozer.

840
01:12:28,157 --> 01:12:30,177
Could he go in there
and take zings away?

841
01:12:30,202 --> 01:12:31,315
No.

842
01:12:31,383 --> 01:12:33,792
But Erik, someone must get in there
and take zings away.

843
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:35,244
Zings are missing.

844
01:12:35,444 --> 01:12:36,739
You must help me.

845
01:12:36,813 --> 01:12:38,732
PLease Erik. Promise that you'll help me.

846
01:12:38,765 --> 01:12:40,864
It's so important to me.

847
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,329
I know it's you.

848
01:13:54,256 --> 01:13:56,086
But I don't know how
he could have done this.

849
01:13:57,167 --> 01:13:58,539
It's all my fault.

850
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:01,130
If I hadn't taken you to that house
and gotten drunk,

851
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:02,566
I could have helped you.

852
01:14:05,892 --> 01:14:07,220
He's crazy.

853
01:14:07,465 --> 01:14:09,195
My experiments are disturbed!

854
01:14:09,295 --> 01:14:11,683
And you were ze only one
who knew somezing about it.

855
01:14:12,063 --> 01:14:14,651
And I zought
you were only interrested in sex!

856
01:14:15,737 --> 01:14:18,637
Don't zink I don't know what's going on
between you and that servant.

857
01:14:19,073 --> 01:14:20,769
I <i>watched</i> you!

858
01:14:21,917 --> 01:14:23,701
Up to fathers old tricks?

859
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,163
Shut up!

860
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:26,994
You're a sex maniac.

861
01:14:27,784 --> 01:14:29,369
Have you been into ze laboratory?

862
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:35,175
Why shall I tell you anything?

863
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,406
Because I did everyzing for you.

864
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:39,570
I gave you everyzing
you ever asked me for.

865
01:14:39,694 --> 01:14:42,561
I never interfered
in your dirty sexlife.

866
01:14:42,762 --> 01:14:44,481
Or your friend, did I?

867
01:14:45,645 --> 01:14:47,898
If I should tell you something,
what will you do for me?

868
01:14:48,657 --> 01:14:49,683
Now.

869
01:14:49,773 --> 01:14:50,923
What do you want?

870
01:14:51,358 --> 01:14:54,248
There is something very interesting
in your worklab.

871
01:14:55,116 --> 01:14:56,098
What?

872
01:14:57,302 --> 01:14:58,329
Your new guest.

873
01:15:00,014 --> 01:15:01,320
Does he respond only to you?

874
01:15:01,345 --> 01:15:02,390
Yes.

875
01:15:02,943 --> 01:15:03,958
Would he to me?

876
01:15:04,516 --> 01:15:06,012
Only if I tell him.

877
01:15:06,324 --> 01:15:07,050
Then...

878
01:15:07,075 --> 01:15:09,282
You tell him that I want
to see him up here.

879
01:15:09,973 --> 01:15:10,977
Alone.

880
01:15:12,567 --> 01:15:14,074
Tell me what you know.

881
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:19,921
My servant is a friend of his.

882
01:15:20,836 --> 01:15:21,930
And right now

883
01:15:21,955 --> 01:15:23,738
he's probably in
your laboratory.

884
01:15:29,195 --> 01:15:31,003
I know where the rest of your body is.

885
01:15:31,795 --> 01:15:33,111
I buried it myself.

886
01:15:33,457 --> 01:15:35,940
We'll come back here with a gun
and make them put you together.

887
01:15:35,965 --> 01:15:36,956
No.

888
01:15:38,105 --> 01:15:39,422
I don't care.

889
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:41,520
It doesn't matter.

890
01:15:41,576 --> 01:15:42,813
Maybe it'll be alright.

891
01:15:42,838 --> 01:15:44,164
It's still your brain.

892
01:15:47,133 --> 01:15:48,192
Not really.

893
01:15:48,639 --> 01:15:50,335
I never could figure you out.

894
01:15:50,569 --> 01:15:52,421
Breathing is better that not breathing.

895
01:15:52,789 --> 01:15:53,805
No.

896
01:15:54,385 --> 01:15:55,724
I want to be dead.

897
01:15:56,576 --> 01:15:57,992
I'm not sure about her.

898
01:15:59,131 --> 01:16:00,414
But I think it's the same.

899
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:01,486
No!

900
01:16:01,511 --> 01:16:03,002
Now let's go.

901
01:16:05,008 --> 01:16:06,079
Come.

902
01:16:09,382 --> 01:16:10,419
If she can leave.

903
01:16:10,444 --> 01:16:12,416
You can come too.
Come on.

904
01:16:20,433 --> 01:16:21,549
Where are you going?

905
01:16:21,695 --> 01:16:23,524
We're leaving
and you're not stopping us.

906
01:16:23,549 --> 01:16:24,920
You're not going to leave.

907
01:16:25,953 --> 01:16:26,870
They're staying here.

908
01:16:26,895 --> 01:16:27,985
And you too.

909
01:16:29,402 --> 01:16:30,530
Take him.

910
01:16:32,182 --> 01:16:33,665
He's not taking anybody.

911
01:16:33,732 --> 01:16:35,027
He's coming with me.

912
01:16:35,052 --> 01:16:36,321
<i>Do as I say!</i>

913
01:16:39,022 --> 01:16:40,395
Make him unconscious.

914
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,727
Do somezing Otto!

915
01:16:46,086 --> 01:16:47,335
Catch him!

916
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,125
Get up you fool.

917
01:16:54,203 --> 01:16:55,375
<i>Go after him!</i>

918
01:16:59,256 --> 01:17:01,231
You are not leaving here alive.

919
01:17:03,413 --> 01:17:05,556
You're crazy.
You're not gonna get away with this.

920
01:17:17,891 --> 01:17:19,320
Make him unconscious.

921
01:17:19,454 --> 01:17:20,904
Biut don't kill him.

922
01:17:21,028 --> 01:17:23,057
Or damage his head in any way.

923
01:17:23,448 --> 01:17:25,781
I need his brain for my zombie.

924
01:17:25,806 --> 01:17:28,450
I'm sure it has
the right instincts we want.

925
01:17:38,674 --> 01:17:41,208
I'm glad we got rid of that lowlife.

926
01:17:41,621 --> 01:17:43,394
Certainly made a mistake
about this one.

927
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:45,247
You were happy with him at first.

928
01:17:45,272 --> 01:17:46,753
Learned my lesson.

929
01:17:47,516 --> 01:17:49,078
Ready for a new experience.

930
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:51,968
So soon, Katherine

931
01:17:52,423 --> 01:17:53,382
Yes

932
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:55,827
Is your new man available?

933
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:57,723
Actually he's prepared.

934
01:17:58,002 --> 01:17:59,285
Come here!

935
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,553
Have you instructed him to do as I say?

936
01:18:08,543 --> 01:18:10,340
I'm ready to tell him what I want.

937
01:18:14,833 --> 01:18:16,541
I hope you'll be very tempered.

938
01:18:17,132 --> 01:18:18,180
What do you mean?

939
01:18:18,205 --> 01:18:19,810
His wounds are not healed yet.

940
01:18:19,932 --> 01:18:21,294
Here! I'll show you.

941
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:25,400
Touch here.

942
01:18:25,636 --> 01:18:26,730
And here.

943
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:28,749
But not here.

944
01:18:28,861 --> 01:18:30,557
It's very recent.

945
01:18:33,014 --> 01:18:34,777
I'll bring him back within two hours.

946
01:18:36,775 --> 01:18:38,671
I wouldn't say untouched.

947
01:18:40,866 --> 01:18:42,618
But intact.

948
01:18:43,377 --> 01:18:45,308
I hope you have some success.

949
01:18:46,469 --> 01:18:48,008
You go with my sister

950
01:18:48,033 --> 01:18:50,039
and you do what she demands.

951
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:52,966
Is that alright with you?

952
01:18:53,524 --> 01:18:54,807
What you want.

953
01:18:54,832 --> 01:18:56,158
But Baron.

954
01:18:56,748 --> 01:18:58,756
Our experiments are too precious

955
01:18:58,888 --> 01:19:01,421
to leave the laboratory
wizout your supervision.

956
01:19:01,446 --> 01:19:02,536
Shut up!

957
01:19:02,592 --> 01:19:03,496
Otto.

958
01:19:03,521 --> 01:19:05,047
My sister did help me.

959
01:19:05,072 --> 01:19:07,012
And I'm very grateful to her.

960
01:19:07,201 --> 01:19:09,823
You couldn't provide me
with the information I needed.

961
01:19:10,994 --> 01:19:13,493
You didn't know
who'd been into ze laboratory.

962
01:19:13,904 --> 01:19:15,142
Yet she could.

963
01:19:15,344 --> 01:19:17,575
So what are you whining about?

964
01:19:17,865 --> 01:19:20,287
My work has been sabotaged
from ze outside.

965
01:19:20,366 --> 01:19:22,619
And zat too many zings
happened today at my laboratory

966
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:26,311
zat I interfere
in my own sisters amusements!

967
01:19:26,756 --> 01:19:28,117
But Baron...

968
01:19:28,173 --> 01:19:30,494
She will abuse him
or spoil him.

969
01:19:31,342 --> 01:19:32,491
Do him harm.

970
01:19:32,516 --> 01:19:33,964
That's enough Otto!

971
01:19:34,562 --> 01:19:37,619
You are very well aware
of my personal habits.

972
01:19:38,322 --> 01:19:40,476
What is it to him?

973
01:19:45,216 --> 01:19:46,577
Thank you brother.

974
01:19:49,623 --> 01:19:51,097
Why are you standing there?

975
01:19:51,643 --> 01:19:53,026
Get me some chemicals.

976
01:19:53,149 --> 01:19:54,801
As long as the parts are fresh.

977
01:19:55,203 --> 01:19:56,922
We have to dismember him immediately.

978
01:19:57,008 --> 01:19:58,704
So he can cause no problems.

979
01:19:59,039 --> 01:20:00,568
What are you waiting for?

980
01:20:02,231 --> 01:20:04,451
Okay, I'll do it myself, you fool.

981
01:20:04,529 --> 01:20:05,355
Come on!

982
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:06,506
I'm waiting.

983
01:20:11,028 --> 01:20:12,790
Tie him up and watch him

984
01:20:17,143 --> 01:20:18,559
Put her away.

985
01:20:19,106 --> 01:20:20,367
What a day.

986
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,926
Always he tells me what to do.

987
01:20:52,516 --> 01:20:54,413
Will you do everything I ask?

988
01:20:55,251 --> 01:20:56,646
What do you want?

989
01:20:57,667 --> 01:20:59,765
Everything I ask is what I want.

990
01:21:21,037 --> 01:21:22,509
Come to bed.

991
01:21:22,799 --> 01:21:24,786
Take your shoes of
and get that thing off.

992
01:21:41,719 --> 01:21:43,503
Are you going to stay just like that?

993
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,372
Move closer.

994
01:21:51,924 --> 01:21:53,374
Touch me.

995
01:21:59,065 --> 01:22:00,426
Not like that.

996
01:22:03,356 --> 01:22:04,539
Gentle.

997
01:22:06,716 --> 01:22:07,942
There.

998
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:09,806
More.

999
01:22:11,346 --> 01:22:12,540
Lower.

1000
01:22:13,153 --> 01:22:14,314
Lower.

1001
01:22:22,794 --> 01:22:24,067
Bring your hand up.

1002
01:22:25,964 --> 01:22:27,236
Touch me.

1003
01:22:30,443 --> 01:22:32,139
Hold me close to you.

1004
01:22:36,671 --> 01:22:37,897
Hold me.

1005
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:39,828
Tighter.

1006
01:22:40,553 --> 01:22:41,870
Squeeze me tight.

1007
01:22:43,871 --> 01:22:45,110
Tighter.

1008
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:48,301
Hold me close.

1009
01:22:50,321 --> 01:22:51,169
Ooh.

1010
01:22:51,214 --> 01:22:52,174
Not...

1011
01:22:52,407 --> 01:22:54,148
Why did you..
Not so.. Close!

1012
01:22:54,173 --> 01:22:55,417
I've told...

1013
01:22:55,986 --> 01:22:57,626
Stop it. What are you doing?

1014
01:22:58,753 --> 01:23:00,237
I cannot breathe!

1015
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:01,856
Stop it!

1016
01:23:03,266 --> 01:23:04,371
<i>Stop it!</i>

1017
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,321
Stop...

1018
01:23:13,733 --> 01:23:16,646
The Baron rewarded his sister
for one days loyalty...

1019
01:23:16,671 --> 01:23:19,469
with two hours of company
wiz a mere creature.

1020
01:23:19,904 --> 01:23:21,991
For a whole life of loyalty...

1021
01:23:22,428 --> 01:23:24,426
I take my own reward.

1022
01:23:25,085 --> 01:23:26,636
I have my own rights.

1023
01:23:27,729 --> 01:23:30,028
I had more right to ze girl...

1024
01:23:30,122 --> 01:23:32,030
than the Baronesse's boy!

1025
01:23:33,335 --> 01:23:35,936
Each day The Baron
work into his laboratory...

1026
01:23:36,003 --> 01:23:37,486
I work too.

1027
01:23:37,971 --> 01:23:39,668
I never had pleasure.

1028
01:23:40,549 --> 01:23:43,293
He never finished
medical school, but I...

1029
01:23:44,053 --> 01:23:46,025
I have everyzing
learned in ze field.

1030
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:47,435
Not out of books.

1031
01:23:48,166 --> 01:23:50,555
And now I know exactly...

1032
01:23:51,347 --> 01:23:52,663
how to do it.

1033
01:23:54,347 --> 01:23:55,676
You wanna watch me?

1034
01:23:57,884 --> 01:23:59,146
I show you.

1035
01:24:27,787 --> 01:24:29,160
You are so pretty.

1036
01:24:29,842 --> 01:24:31,326
You are so wonderful.

1037
01:24:31,773 --> 01:24:34,540
You are such a
wonderful female creation.

1038
01:25:02,867 --> 01:25:04,854
Now, I'll get into you.

1039
01:25:06,472 --> 01:25:07,889
I have to get in.

1040
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,541
She.. She...

1041
01:25:27,566 --> 01:25:29,383
She's ruined.

1042
01:25:35,565 --> 01:25:37,183
It's not true.

1043
01:25:37,451 --> 01:25:38,555
No.

1044
01:25:38,712 --> 01:25:40,174
It can't be true

1045
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:41,971
What are you doing to me?

1046
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:45,016
You destroyed my female.

1047
01:25:45,996 --> 01:25:47,926
You put your dirty hands on her.

1048
01:25:48,093 --> 01:25:49,678
But you went into her, Baron.

1049
01:25:50,169 --> 01:25:51,553
Bastard!

1050
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,173
I studied how to do it.

1051
01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:56,071
I know how to do it!

1052
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,470
You don't!
Wiz your filthy hand.

1053
01:25:59,362 --> 01:26:00,646
Everyzing...

1054
01:26:00,992 --> 01:26:02,208
I cannot put it back.

1055
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:05,188
All the effort and time
I put in it to create her!

1056
01:26:10,941 --> 01:26:12,013
All her...

1057
01:26:12,038 --> 01:26:13,317
inside is out.

1058
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:15,148
What do I have to do?

1059
01:26:15,173 --> 01:26:16,509
To find a new female?

1060
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:20,673
When I took her as a student...

1061
01:26:20,698 --> 01:26:22,134
you knew nozing of medicine.

1062
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:23,674
I taught you everyzing!

1063
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:27,329
But zat's happen if you attach people
who know nozing about medicine.

1064
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:28,858
They are too stupid!

1065
01:26:31,487 --> 01:26:33,048
It's all your fault.

1066
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:35,091
You had pleasure wiz my wife.
Didn't you?

1067
01:26:35,258 --> 01:26:36,408
I watched you.

1068
01:26:36,433 --> 01:26:38,092
You enjoyed yourselves.

1069
01:26:39,744 --> 01:26:41,541
For a peasant boy!

1070
01:26:43,792 --> 01:26:45,053
Oh no.

1071
01:26:45,923 --> 01:26:46,883
Oh.

1072
01:26:47,842 --> 01:26:49,059
Oh no.

01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:51,525
Kathrine.

1074
01:26:52,506 --> 01:26:53,522
My...

1075
01:26:53,547 --> 01:26:55,017
My wife...

1076
01:26:57,195 --> 01:26:58,980
Ze mozer of my children.

1077
01:27:00,788 --> 01:27:01,948
You killed her!

1078
01:27:01,973 --> 01:27:03,711
On account of him!

1079
01:27:06,568 --> 01:27:07,706
My sister...

1080
01:27:07,912 --> 01:27:09,586
My beautiful sister.

1081
01:27:09,753 --> 01:27:11,193
You killed her.

1082
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:23,284
Kill him.

1083
01:27:24,846 --> 01:27:26,040
Kill him.

1084
01:27:28,673 --> 01:27:29,811
<i>Kill him!</i>

1085
01:27:39,810 --> 01:27:41,206
<i>Kill him!</i>

1086
01:27:51,319 --> 01:27:52,870
Listen to my command.

1087
01:27:53,606 --> 01:27:55,470
I want you to kill him.

1088
01:27:56,163 --> 01:27:57,457
You understand?

1089
01:27:58,015 --> 01:27:59,343
He is not your friend.

1090
01:27:59,421 --> 01:28:00,559
I'm your friend.

1091
01:28:00,637 --> 01:28:02,044
I created you.

1092
01:28:03,906 --> 01:28:05,100
<i>Kill him!</i>

1093
01:28:09,298 --> 01:28:10,369

Stop!

1095
01:28:13,964 --> 01:28:15,192
Listen to my response.

1096
01:28:15,471 --> 01:28:16,799
Come into the table.

1097
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:18,918
Stop!

1098
01:28:20,838 --> 01:28:21,909
<i>Go back!</i>

1099
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:24,143

1100
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:27,836
<i>Go back!</i>

1101
01:28:28,498 --> 01:28:29,681
STOP!

1102
01:29:12,156 --> 01:29:14,042
It's all your fault!

1103
01:29:30,943 --> 01:29:32,471
I make you pay for zis.

1104
01:29:32,578 --> 01:29:34,353
You trouble making bastard.

1105
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:54,668
You have put an end to my experiments.

1106
01:29:56,051 --> 01:29:57,735
But my work will live on.

1107
01:29:59,556 --> 01:30:01,004
I'm not going to die...

1108
01:30:01,029 --> 01:30:01,965
In vain.

1109
01:30:02,721 --> 01:30:04,061
My work is not...

1110
01:30:04,086 --> 01:30:05,277
finished.

1111
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:08,998
But I know I was...

1112
01:30:09,023 --> 01:30:11,208
working in the right direction.

1113
01:30:12,825 --> 01:30:14,433
I had.. no one.

1114
01:30:14,835 --> 01:30:16,487
Just a laboratory.

1115
01:30:16,676 --> 01:30:18,372
And a dream.

1116
01:30:19,387 --> 01:30:20,838
Ze female is dead.

1117
01:30:21,369 --> 01:30:22,674
But he lives.

1118
01:30:22,699 --> 01:30:24,493
He will.. show the world...

1119
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:26,603
My genius.

1120
01:30:28,336 --> 01:30:29,709
When they...

1121
01:30:29,898 --> 01:30:31,450
roll out ze tape...

1122
01:30:32,108 --> 01:30:33,368
there can be...

1123
01:30:34,135 --> 01:30:35,073
riches...

1124
01:30:37,112 --> 01:30:38,283
Perfection.

1125
01:30:41,655 --> 01:30:43,127
I wanted...

1126
01:30:44,009 --> 01:30:45,326
to...

1127
01:30:45,694 --> 01:30:47,056
prove...

1128
01:30:49,302 --> 01:30:50,262
I...

1129
01:30:50,351 --> 01:30:51,512
don't...

1130
01:30:51,914 --> 01:30:53,285
regret...

1131
01:30:54,435 --> 01:30:55,886
anyzing.

1132
01:31:01,321 --> 01:31:02,447
I...

1133
01:31:02,472 --> 01:31:03,619
tried...

1134
01:31:05,014 --> 01:31:06,075
My...

1135
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,268
best.

1136
01:31:22,231 --> 01:31:24,295
He won't be giving you
anymore orders now.

1137
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:25,880
He got what he deserved.

1138
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:28,290
Let me down so we can get out of here.

1139
01:31:29,561 --> 01:31:31,112
If I let you down

1140
01:31:31,137 --> 01:31:32,372
what will you do?

1141
01:31:32,674 --> 01:31:35,006
I'll take you out of here.
I'll take you to a real doctor

1142
01:31:35,363 --> 01:31:36,970
Then I cannot let you down.

1143
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:39,416
I must die here.

1144
01:31:39,617 --> 01:31:41,749
Why? It's okay now.
He's dead.

1145
01:31:42,306 --> 01:31:43,835
I'm more like them than you.

1146
01:31:43,904 --> 01:31:45,183
I belong here.

1147
01:31:45,335 --> 01:31:46,663
That is terrible.

1148
01:31:46,688 --> 01:31:48,314
But there is not life for me.

1149
01:31:48,682 --> 01:31:51,015
What are talking about.
I'm your best friend.

1150
01:31:51,394 --> 01:31:52,755
You know me before...

1151
01:31:52,974 --> 01:31:54,325
But not now.

1152
01:31:55,017 --> 01:31:56,501
I must be dead.
