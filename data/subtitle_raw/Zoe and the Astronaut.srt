Zoe and the Astronaut - Subtitles

4
00:00:29,354 --> 00:00:31,287
I don't know how to say this.

5
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:35,504
There is no easy way.

6
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:42,314
Zoe, you're cancer has spread.

7
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:52,631
As you know, chemotherapy hasn't worked.

8
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:58,480
In situations like yours, as your doctor,

9
00:00:59,864 --> 00:01:02,397
my best advice is to prepare yourself.

10
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:09,002
If there is anything you would like to do,
I would urge you to do it.

11
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:15,680
Live your days. Have fun.

12
00:01:28,865 --> 00:01:31,865
How long has she got?

13
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:37,881
A few months. Three or four at the most.

14
00:01:39,663 --> 00:01:40,796
Four at the most?

15
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:45,812
I'm sorry.

16
00:03:29,203 --> 00:03:30,703
ZOE: Hi, Dad.

17
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:33,154
Hi, Darling. How are you feeling?

18
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:35,054
I'm okay.

19
00:03:35,953 --> 00:03:37,986
Did you get what you were looking for?

20
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:40,053
I found a couple of things.

21
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:41,572
What are you doing?

22
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:44,671
Bills, bills and more bills.

23
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:47,586
ELIZABETH: Hi, Darling.

24
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:51,703
Yasmin came around. I told her you were at
the shops. She's going to come back later.

25
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:53,055
Great. Thanks.

26
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:56,829
I'm going to go upstairs and rest a little.

27
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:58,202
Okay, honey.

28
00:03:58,253 --> 00:03:59,253
Okay. See you.

29
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:13,520
Is everything okay?

30
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:16,794
Not really.

31
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:19,955
We've lost the Hamilton contract.

32
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:26,619
We can't afford the treatment in California

33
00:04:27,155 --> 00:04:28,555
I'll get another job.

34
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:31,737
No. It won't be enough.

35
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:34,836
We're running out of time.

36
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:05,213
(Coughing)

37
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:09,815
(Vomitting)

38
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:27,663
Are you okay, Zoe?

39
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:32,014
Just feeling a bit sick, but I'm okay.

40
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:34,846
I'll get you something.

41
00:06:34,913 --> 00:06:35,913
No, Mum!

42
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:37,617
I said "I'm okay".

43
00:06:41,171 --> 00:06:43,071
Sorry.

44
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,813
I'm going to brush my teeth and go to bed.

45
00:06:48,563 --> 00:06:49,563
Okay.

46
00:06:50,864 --> 00:06:54,664
Well, sleep tight and let me know
if you need anything.

47
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:56,613
Okay.

48
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:00,812
Goodnight.

49
00:07:42,931 --> 00:07:45,598
Are you feeling better after last night?

50
00:07:45,721 --> 00:07:48,188
I just felt a bit queasy. That's all.

51
00:07:49,364 --> 00:07:51,097
They said it would happen.

52
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:54,181
Do you want me to call them?

53
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:55,531
No. That's fine.

54
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,631
Are you going to eat something?

55
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,234
I'm not really hungry.

56
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:06,114
You'll waste away.

57
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,446
I'm already wasting away, Mum.

58
00:08:23,582 --> 00:08:28,582
Why don't you come with me to the office?
I've got to pick up a few files.

59
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:31,765
We'll get a burger on the way back.

60
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:33,839
I'm a vegetarian, Dad.

61
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,273
Well, we''ll get a veggie burger.

62
00:08:37,673 --> 00:08:39,773
(Laughs). Okay.

63
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,023
Right.

64
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,522
Are you looking forward to that burger?

65
00:08:54,874 --> 00:08:55,874
Yeah.

66
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:03,973
Listen, Zoe. Your mother...

67
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:05,347
Just go easy on her.

68
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:10,166
She's only worried because she loves you.

69
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:14,990
I just don't think she's come to terms
with what's going to happen.

70
00:09:17,983 --> 00:09:20,050
We'll deal with it.

71
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:22,413
I know you'll handle it.

72
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,984
How's that boyfriend of yours?

73
00:09:31,313 --> 00:09:32,513
Rob?

74
00:09:32,593 --> 00:09:33,993
JOHN: Rob, hmm.

75
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:37,993
We broke up.

76
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:40,542
What happened?

77
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:45,680
He said he had his whole life ahead of him

78
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:49,995
and he couldn't deal with the stress
of a dying girlfriend. So...

79
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:51,784
He said that?

80
00:09:52,232 --> 00:09:53,232
ZOE: Yeah.

81
00:09:53,732 --> 00:09:54,732
What a dick!

82
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:02,344
JOHN: Okay. That's everything. Come on.

83
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:05,296
Are you alright with that?
- Yeah. Fine.

84
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:10,446
Alright. Put that straight in there.
That's good. Take that.

85
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:11,594
On there.

86
00:10:14,093 --> 00:10:16,293
ZOE: Is that everything?
- Yeah. Yeah. Right!

87
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:18,810
Let's go get that burger!

88
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:19,894
Veggie burger!

89
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,263
Good?

90
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:34,913
Really good.

91
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:39,383
Dad?

92
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:40,733
JOHN: Hmm?

93
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,300
Tell me the story about how
you and Mum met.

94
00:10:44,323 --> 00:10:45,323
(Laughs)

95
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,875
Why do you want to know that again?

96
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:52,877
In the end, you start thinking
about the beginning.

97
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:56,960
We were at College together and...

98
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:59,776
One day, I needed the toilet.

99
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:02,676
I went into the wrong toilet,
I went into the Ladies'...

100
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:05,076
And there was your Mother.

101
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:10,109
She was the most beautiful girl
I'd ever seen.

102
00:11:17,063 --> 00:11:19,196
What will you do after I'm gone?

103
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,880
Do you think you'll stay together?

104
00:11:25,027 --> 00:11:27,360
Of course we'll stay together, Zoe.

105
00:11:28,924 --> 00:11:30,191
I love your Mother.

106
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:34,140
I love You. Very much.

107
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:39,590
We'll just take each day as it comes.

108
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:42,673
(Gasping)

109
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:44,088
(Coughing)

110
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:46,722
What's the matter?

111
00:11:48,023 --> 00:11:49,223
I feel sick.

112
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:52,474
Listen. We are two minutes away from home.

113
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:54,673
Dad? Pull over.

114
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:56,055
JOHN: Alright. Okay.

115
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:57,322
Pull over! Quick.

116
00:11:57,703 --> 00:12:00,236
Okay. Just keep breathing. Here we go.

117
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:12,583
(Coughing)

118
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:21,633
JOHN: Alright. Come on. You're alright.

119
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:25,150
Keep breathing. Keep breathing.

120
00:12:26,293 --> 00:12:27,493
You'll be fine.

121
00:12:32,843 --> 00:12:35,043
I think it was the Veggie Burger.

122
00:12:35,193 --> 00:12:37,126
JOHN: Ahh! The Veggie Burger.

123
00:12:43,193 --> 00:12:44,993
(Rumbling sound in the sky)

124
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:51,716
ZOE: Shit. Dad?

125
00:12:51,882 --> 00:12:53,482
What is that?

126
00:12:57,684 --> 00:12:58,684
(Crash)

127
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:02,934
Listen. Stay there. Just stay there.

128
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,183
ZOE: Dad!

129
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:06,932
Dad! Wait!

130
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:07,853
Dad! Over here!

131
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:17,536
Jesus! Are you alright?

132
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:22,237
Christ! You could've died there.

133
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,596
That was some crash.

134
00:14:25,854 --> 00:14:26,854
It's my Pod.

135
00:14:28,104 --> 00:14:29,104
JOHN: What?

136
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,486
It's my Space Pod.

137
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:33,786
I'm an Astronaut.

138
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,876
JOHN: Can you walk?

139
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:41,862
I just need to get used to it.

140
00:14:42,613 --> 00:14:44,346
Should we contact someone?

141
00:14:48,563 --> 00:14:50,430
Our house is near here.

142
00:14:50,513 --> 00:14:52,513
We'll get you there.
We'll sort things from there.

143
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:54,563
Thanks.

144
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:57,014
Come on.

145
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:03,815
Through here.

146
00:15:05,913 --> 00:15:06,913
Here you go.

147
00:15:06,962 --> 00:15:08,762
Ohh. Jesus!

148
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:11,879
JOHN: Water. Get some Water.

149
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:15,662
JOHN: Okay. You're alright.

150
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:20,446
Christ! I can't believe you're alive.

151
00:15:21,162 --> 00:15:22,429
Give him the water.

152
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:26,930
ZOE: Do you want some water?

153
00:15:26,962 --> 00:15:27,962
Err...

154
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:30,762
ZOE: Are you sure you're okay?

155
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:33,764
ZOE: I think you should sit down.

156
00:15:35,763 --> 00:15:36,763
ZOE: Dad!!

157
00:15:37,114 --> 00:15:38,114
Dad!!

158
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:08,656
Hi.

159
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,103
Where am I?

160
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:15,686
You're in our house.

161
00:16:15,802 --> 00:16:19,069
You passed out. You've been asleep
for two days.

162
00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:21,052
Where are my clothes?

163
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:24,572
Err..Over there.

164
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:31,454
...

165
00:16:31,953 --> 00:16:34,753
Are you hungry? You must be hungry.

166
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,420
My Mum has made breakfast downstairs.
So come and join us...

167
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:40,537
When you're dressed.

168
00:16:43,953 --> 00:16:45,853
Morning.

169
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:49,502
Ahh. Good morning.

170
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:50,652
Morning.

171
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:52,720
Did you sleep alright?

172
00:16:52,754 --> 00:16:53,754
Yes. Thankyou.

173
00:16:54,704 --> 00:16:56,537
Well, you've been out for two days.

174
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:57,870
You must be hungry?

175
00:17:00,703 --> 00:17:03,736
Please. Take a seat.

176
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:08,803
Okay...um...

177
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:13,304
I'm John and this is my wife, Elizabeth.

178
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:15,754
This is our beautiful daughter, Zoe.

179
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:17,736
She's the one that found you.

180
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:19,153
Nice to meet you all.

181
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:23,463
And you are?...

182
00:17:24,003 --> 00:17:25,003
Jacques

183
00:17:26,054 --> 00:17:27,321
My name is Jacques.

184
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:29,271
ELIZABETH: Jacques?

185
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,290
Jacques?

186
00:17:30,303 --> 00:17:31,303
Very nice.

187
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:32,653
Sit down.

188
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,320
ELIZABETH: Come on. We don't bite.

189
00:17:39,453 --> 00:17:41,120
ELIZABETH: So...

190
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:44,570
I know you're not supposed to talk
about this, but John says

191
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:46,986
You're an Astronaut.

192
00:17:47,552 --> 00:17:49,919
ELIZABETH: That you crash landed
in the field over the way?

193
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,153
That's right.

194
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:56,286
No offense, but you seem very young to be
an Astronaut.

195
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:58,436
Where are you based?

196
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:00,603
I wasn't based anywhere.

197
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:02,632
I was born in space.

198
00:18:05,503 --> 00:18:06,503
What?

199
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:09,255
Born in space?

200
00:18:09,553 --> 00:18:13,086
My Mother and Father were part of a
Space Cosmonaut mission.

201
00:18:13,154 --> 00:18:15,687
The mission was aborted when they
veered off course.

202
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:19,556
They drifted into the cosmos
and lost contact.

203
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:21,454
How did you get back?

204
00:18:21,803 --> 00:18:23,736
We'd been drifting for years.

205
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:27,320
Thankfully, our ship had everything
we needed.

206
00:18:27,603 --> 00:18:29,603
We caught a glimpse of earth
a few months ago...

207
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:33,003
It was our only chance of getting back.

208
00:18:33,356 --> 00:18:35,756
My parents...

209
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:37,953
They put me in a Pod
and fired me toward Earth.

210
00:18:39,804 --> 00:18:40,904
JOHN: So...

211
00:18:42,257 --> 00:18:44,057
Where are your parents now?

212
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:46,392
They're probably dead now.

213
00:18:48,054 --> 00:18:49,721
All our crops had failed.

214
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:52,370
We wouldn't be able to live much longer.

215
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:53,621
That's terrible.

216
00:18:55,703 --> 00:18:56,770
How old are you?

217
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:59,453
20 years old.

218
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:04,320
That's a long time in space.

219
00:19:09,753 --> 00:19:13,386
Alright. Let's get moving.

220
00:19:31,944 --> 00:19:32,944
Eat up.

221
00:19:34,693 --> 00:19:38,093
A young man like you needs to keep his
strength up.

222
00:19:58,034 --> 00:20:00,101
This is amazing!

223
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:05,237
That's bacon and those are eggs.

224
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:08,153
I've never tasted anything like it.

225
00:20:09,444 --> 00:20:13,044
Well, you can't have many pigs and chickens
in space.

226
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:14,693
No.

227
00:20:18,944 --> 00:20:20,144
(Whispers)
JOHN: No,no,no.

228
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:21,692
- ELIZABETH: Let him stay, come on.

229
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:23,993
JOHN: No, because it's ridiculous.
- ELIZABETH: Why not?

230
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:27,676
ELIZABETH: Why is it ridiculous?
His whole family has died.

231
00:20:27,843 --> 00:20:28,976
JOHN: Look, stop.

232
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:31,994
JOHN: We don't know anything about him.

233
00:20:32,693 --> 00:20:33,893
ELIZABETH: He seems great.

234
00:20:34,294 --> 00:20:36,427
And look. Look how happy she is.

235
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:37,760
ELIZABETH: Look!

236
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:39,010
JOHN: This is not about you.

237
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:41,524
It doesn't have to be forever.
I'm not saying it's about me.

238
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:43,544
JOHN: It's about Zoe.
- ELIZABETH: Really?

239
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:50,339
Jacques...

240
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:56,900
ELIZABETH: With you being from out of space...

241
00:20:57,034 --> 00:21:01,034
and not having a family, we thought you
could stay with us.

242
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:05,032
ELIZABETH: We've got plenty of room.

243
00:21:05,082 --> 00:21:07,815
Just until you get yourself
sorted out.

244
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:09,632
That's very kind. Thankyou.

245
00:21:11,432 --> 00:21:12,432
Great.

246
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:14,816
Right. Well that's that then.

247
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:21,017
JOHN: Zoe, why don't you go for a
walk with Jacques and show him around.

248
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:24,034
We might need to get him some new clothes.

249
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:32,333
Right. Yes. I'll sort some out.
Some of mine.

250
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:46,094
ZOE: So, what's it like up there?

251
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:47,991
In space.

252
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:51,765
There's no light.

253
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:54,582
No noise.

254
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:57,049
No air.

255
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,316
I've been looking at the stars a lot, recently.

256
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:04,584
Wondering what Earth looks like
from up there.

257
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,301
It looks like hope.

258
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:17,332
I'm dying.

259
00:22:18,382 --> 00:22:19,782
Dying?

260
00:22:20,983 --> 00:22:22,350
I've got cancer.

261
00:22:26,283 --> 00:22:30,216
Oh. It's a terminal illness.
- JACQUES: I know what it is.

262
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:32,631
Crazy, right?

263
00:22:34,235 --> 00:22:35,235
Is it curable?

264
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:37,733
Not mine.

265
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:41,933
The doctor says I only have
a few months to live. So...

266
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:45,589
I'm sorry.

267
00:22:48,187 --> 00:22:50,054
I just thought you should know.

268
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:55,114
If you're going to be staying
with us for awhile.

269
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:02,500
JACQUES: What's 'Ice Cream'?

270
00:23:05,932 --> 00:23:08,199
Are you serious?

271
00:23:10,033 --> 00:23:12,133
Come on.

272
00:23:51,532 --> 00:23:52,532
ZOE: Mum, Dad?

273
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:56,737
We're in here watching a film, love.

274
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:01,603
ZOE: Hi.

275
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:06,169
Come and join us, if you like.
Come in Jacques.

276
00:24:07,303 --> 00:24:08,303
Sit down.

277
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:55,795
JOHN: Morning, Jacques.

278
00:24:55,872 --> 00:24:57,172
Morning, John.

279
00:24:57,773 --> 00:24:59,240
JOHN: Is everything alright?

280
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:00,573
Fine. Yes.

281
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,324
JOHN: Good.

282
00:25:03,123 --> 00:25:05,123
You're sky is quite something.

283
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,323
JOHN: Yes.

284
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:11,173
Yes, I suppose it is.

285
00:25:14,923 --> 00:25:17,256
Do the birds always make
this sound in the morning?

286
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:18,773
- Oh. Yes.

287
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:26,840
Look, Jacques. There's...

288
00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:29,341
There's something I need to tell you.

289
00:25:31,423 --> 00:25:33,823
Zoe's not well. She's sick.

290
00:25:35,823 --> 00:25:38,590
She has something called 'leukaemia'.

291
00:25:41,023 --> 00:25:46,156
It's rather delicate because the doctors
say she doesn't have long to live.

292
00:25:46,523 --> 00:25:47,523
Yes.

293
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:49,472
She told me.

294
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,500
She told you?

295
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:57,523
Yesterday.

296
00:25:58,923 --> 00:25:59,923
Oh, right.

297
00:26:02,623 --> 00:26:07,523
Listen, I need to get to work now so...

298
00:26:08,725 --> 00:26:10,125
- JACQUES: Bye, John.

299
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:12,672
Yeah. Bye.

300
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:04,523
Oh. Hello.

301
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:06,028
JACQUES: Hello.

302
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:08,423
I'm looking for Zoe.
Is she in?

303
00:27:09,073 --> 00:27:11,073
ZOE: Hey, Yasmin.
Come on in.

304
00:27:14,373 --> 00:27:16,640
Who's that, Zoe? You little devil.

305
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:19,893
Ahh... Yas, this is Jacques.

306
00:27:20,624 --> 00:27:24,357
ZOE: A friend of the family.

307
00:27:24,423 --> 00:27:26,156
ZOE: He's staying with us.

308
00:27:26,373 --> 00:27:27,440
YASMIN: Jacques?

309
00:27:27,573 --> 00:27:29,173
YASMIN: That's a nice name.

310
00:27:29,224 --> 00:27:31,024
What is that? French?

311
00:27:32,223 --> 00:27:33,223
...

312
00:27:33,323 --> 00:27:34,323
Yeah.

313
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:36,923
So what's up?

314
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:40,640
I need a favour.
It's Steve.

315
00:27:42,673 --> 00:27:43,673
What about him?

316
00:27:43,673 --> 00:27:44,873
I need to see him.

317
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:48,024
Yas, stay away from him.
He's a loser.

318
00:27:48,026 --> 00:27:51,426
- I know. He's got my Mum's engagement ring
and he won't give it back.

319
00:27:51,523 --> 00:27:53,590
Can you come with me to get it?

320
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:55,623
When?

321
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:57,506
- Now. Before he pawns it.

322
00:27:57,573 --> 00:28:00,173
ZOE: Yas...
- Please, Zoe.

323
00:28:02,374 --> 00:28:03,374
Okay.

324
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:05,756
But this is the last time.

325
00:28:10,073 --> 00:28:12,140
I'll come with you.

326
00:28:17,972 --> 00:28:20,839
ZOE: Jacques, wait here.
We won't be long.

327
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:27,957
STEVE: No, you can't have it.

328
00:28:28,423 --> 00:28:30,456
ZOE: Come on, Steve. Be reasonable.

329
00:28:30,473 --> 00:28:31,873
DAVEY: Be reasonable?

330
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,313
You've got a lot of nerve for someone
dying of cancer.

331
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,787
- STEVE: Hey, stop it.

332
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:39,331
How have I not been reasonable?
Consider that ring compensation

333
00:28:39,332 --> 00:28:41,399
for what your friend has put me through.

334
00:28:41,423 --> 00:28:44,990
YASMIN: It's my Mum's engagement ring.
She's heartbroken.

335
00:28:45,003 --> 00:28:46,736
She'll die if she knew that you stole it.

336
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:48,020
What's it worth?

337
00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:50,702
I haven't got any money, Steve.

338
00:28:50,989 --> 00:28:52,889
Sure we can find another way
for you to pay.

339
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,433
You're sick!

340
00:28:55,693 --> 00:28:57,226
Come on, Yas. Let's go.

341
00:28:57,693 --> 00:28:59,160
We'll call the police.

342
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:02,861
- Oh no you won't. If you do,
I'll tell them that we stole it together

343
00:29:02,862 --> 00:29:05,262
and your mum will never forgive you.

344
00:29:05,404 --> 00:29:06,404
Let's go, Yas.

345
00:29:07,606 --> 00:29:10,373
DAVEY: Think about that offer, girls.

346
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,032
Yas!

347
00:29:12,063 --> 00:29:13,730
I'll be waiting.

348
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:25,416
YAS: Oh my god. I hate him so much.

349
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,433
JACQUES: Did you get it?

350
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:30,283
No.

351
00:29:31,783 --> 00:29:33,050
JACQUES: Wait here.

352
00:29:34,882 --> 00:29:37,282
ZOE: No, Jacques. It's not worth it.

353
00:29:37,487 --> 00:29:39,554
Wait here. I'll speak with him.

354
00:29:45,886 --> 00:29:49,386
I smacked him, he's gone down.
Everyone starts screaming...

355
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,920
...his girlfriend has run out
into the street...

356
00:29:52,887 --> 00:29:55,154
STEVE: You smacked him and he went down?
- I know but...

357
00:29:56,983 --> 00:29:58,050
Who's this twat?

358
00:29:58,136 --> 00:29:59,703
Are you alright, blondie?
Are you lost?

359
00:29:59,835 --> 00:30:01,135
What the fuck do you want?

360
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:03,050
I've come for the ring.

361
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,476
Are you taking the piss?
You can't have it.

362
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:07,810
I'll give you three seconds.

363
00:30:07,813 --> 00:30:09,013
(laughs)
You mug.

364
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,016
And then what?

365
00:30:13,153 --> 00:30:14,820
STEVE: Dave, get him out.

366
00:30:14,902 --> 00:30:19,169
DAVEY: Alright, "Milkybar Kid", I think
it's past your bedtime.

367
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:20,550
(Bones cracking)

368
00:30:24,286 --> 00:30:25,353
(Bones breaking)

369
00:30:27,737 --> 00:30:28,737
(Choking)

370
00:30:29,197 --> 00:30:30,697
(Choking)

371
00:30:31,942 --> 00:30:33,442
(Coughing)

372
00:30:38,647 --> 00:30:39,647
Argghh!!!

373
00:30:41,493 --> 00:30:42,493
Argghh!!!

374
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,733
Thankyou so much!

375
00:30:53,046 --> 00:30:54,179
You're brilliant.

376
00:30:59,043 --> 00:31:00,043
He got it.

377
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:16,643
ZOE: Mum?

378
00:31:17,693 --> 00:31:18,693
Hi, kids.

379
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:20,844
ELIZABETH: Hi, Yas.

380
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:21,845
Hi.

381
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:23,706
Is it okay if Yas stays for dinner?

382
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,715
Of course.

383
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,600
Your dad will be home soon.

384
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:29,928
Jacques, do you want to help me
make a salad?

385
00:31:30,328 --> 00:31:31,328
Sure.

386
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:32,929
ELIZABETH: Come on then.

387
00:31:33,023 --> 00:31:37,023
I'm sure that you two have plenty of gossip
to catch up on.

388
00:31:37,174 --> 00:31:38,341
ELIZABETH: It's really easy.

389
00:31:38,424 --> 00:31:42,191
Just get the knife and chop.

390
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,331
Zoe, I can't tell you how happy
I am I've got the ring back.

391
00:31:56,423 --> 00:31:57,423
I know.

392
00:31:57,929 --> 00:31:59,729
It's all thanks to Jacques.

393
00:32:01,222 --> 00:32:03,355
God knows what he said to Steve.

394
00:32:04,497 --> 00:32:06,097
Are you and him an item?

395
00:32:07,476 --> 00:32:08,476
Me and Jacques?

396
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:11,822
No.

397
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:14,729
You know he's really fit, right?

398
00:32:16,574 --> 00:32:17,574
He's alright.

399
00:32:18,092 --> 00:32:19,092
"Alright"?

400
00:32:19,825 --> 00:32:21,025
You must be blind.

401
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:22,772
(Laughter)

402
00:32:27,526 --> 00:32:30,793
People from college have been asking
about you.

403
00:32:31,922 --> 00:32:33,122
Nobody has called.

404
00:32:33,872 --> 00:32:35,605
They can't care that much.

405
00:32:36,073 --> 00:32:37,273
(Front door opens)

406
00:32:37,472 --> 00:32:38,472
Hi, Dad!

407
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:40,126
JOHN: Hi.

408
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:43,440
Yas?!
- YAS: Hi, Mr Armstrong.

409
00:32:44,826 --> 00:32:47,626
How are you, darling? Alright?
- ZOE: Yeah, I'm okay.

410
00:32:48,523 --> 00:32:51,023
How are your parents?
- YASMIN: They're good, thanks.

411
00:32:51,023 --> 00:32:53,090
Dad, Yas is staying for dinner.

412
00:32:53,443 --> 00:32:55,143
Wonderful.
The more the merrier.

413
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,226
Is your mother home?

414
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,676
Yeah. I think she's upstairs.

415
00:32:59,742 --> 00:33:00,742
Alright.

416
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:08,776
Jacques.

417
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:11,223
I see she got you.

418
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:15,190
She always tries to get me to cut
the salad.

419
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,700
It's the onions. I don't mind eating them.
I can't bear to cut them.

420
00:33:18,827 --> 00:33:20,060
ELIZABETH: Is that you, John?

421
00:33:20,075 --> 00:33:21,075
Yes, dear.

422
00:33:21,473 --> 00:33:23,140
Would you like some wine?

423
00:33:23,944 --> 00:33:25,744
ELIZABETH: Ohh, yes please!

424
00:33:26,273 --> 00:33:28,240
Would you like a glass, Jacques?

425
00:33:28,303 --> 00:33:29,770
JACQUES: No, thankyou.

426
00:33:31,024 --> 00:33:32,024
How...

427
00:33:33,777 --> 00:33:35,310
How are you getting on?

428
00:33:35,623 --> 00:33:36,956
Very well, thankyou.

429
00:33:38,023 --> 00:33:40,156
Your family have been very kind.

430
00:33:40,173 --> 00:33:41,173
You're welcome.

431
00:33:45,174 --> 00:33:48,874
Have you managed to contact anyone yet?

432
00:33:49,073 --> 00:33:50,073
No. Not yet.

433
00:33:51,473 --> 00:33:54,140
Zoe has been showing you around, I hear?

434
00:33:55,523 --> 00:33:56,523
Yes.

435
00:33:57,073 --> 00:33:59,206
Earth is a very beautiful place.

436
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:01,176
Yeah.

437
00:34:01,273 --> 00:34:06,240
I suppose it is. I think most of us are too
preoccupied to realise it most of the time.

438
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,250
(Slice)
JOHN: Whoa!

439
00:34:08,843 --> 00:34:09,843
You okay?

440
00:34:12,373 --> 00:34:13,373
I'm fine. Yes.

441
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,803
Right.

442
00:34:48,952 --> 00:34:49,952
Are you okay?

443
00:34:50,602 --> 00:34:51,602
Yeah.

444
00:34:53,855 --> 00:34:56,188
I'm too tired to sleep. That's all.

445
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:08,370
Are we doing the right thing with this boy?

446
00:35:09,552 --> 00:35:10,552
Jacques?

447
00:35:13,203 --> 00:35:14,336
Letting him stay?

448
00:35:18,957 --> 00:35:20,824
He's got nowhere else to go.

449
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,886
That's not our problem.

450
00:35:26,855 --> 00:35:29,055
We don't know anything about him.

451
00:35:31,156 --> 00:35:34,489
Surely, he should have contacted
someone by now.

452
00:35:38,257 --> 00:35:41,057
It's all a bit strange. Don't you think?

453
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:44,542
You're being paranoid.

454
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:48,185
It's not going to be forever.

455
00:35:50,156 --> 00:35:51,156
I mean...

456
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:55,302
Zoe likes him.

457
00:35:55,901 --> 00:35:56,901
I can see that.

458
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:02,736
Maybe that's what she needs right now.

459
00:36:08,104 --> 00:36:09,104
Maybe.

460
00:36:17,706 --> 00:36:19,639
I just feel so...

461
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:26,308
I just want to protect her.

462
00:36:28,357 --> 00:36:29,357
You do, John.

463
00:36:30,703 --> 00:36:31,703
You do.

464
00:36:36,955 --> 00:36:40,388
I not ready to lose her, Liz.

465
00:36:43,059 --> 00:36:45,126
I'm not ready, yet.

466
00:36:58,223 --> 00:37:01,423
I've never looked at the sky
like this before.

467
00:37:04,326 --> 00:37:05,326
It's beautiful.

468
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:12,309
There's a million stars up there
that connect us all.

469
00:37:17,355 --> 00:37:18,355
Look at that.

470
00:37:19,302 --> 00:37:20,702
It's a shooting star.

471
00:37:22,806 --> 00:37:24,473
That could have been you.

472
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,827
Close your eyes.

473
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,707
Make a wish.

474
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:38,620
What did you wish for?

475
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,925
I wished that this moment would
never end.

476
00:38:04,153 --> 00:38:05,153
ZOE: Hi, Mum.

477
00:38:05,213 --> 00:38:06,880
ELIZABETH: Ah, brilliant.

478
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:08,659
Jacques?

479
00:38:09,406 --> 00:38:13,073
Would you mind getting the shopping
bags from the car?

480
00:38:14,954 --> 00:38:16,287
ELIZABETH: Thankyou.

481
00:38:23,853 --> 00:38:26,520
You two seem to be getting on very well.

482
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:29,607
Yeah.

483
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:31,802
It's been fun showing him around.

484
00:38:31,857 --> 00:38:32,857
Yeah?

485
00:38:33,402 --> 00:38:34,402
- Yeah.

486
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:37,518
It's really opened my eyes to how beautiful
the world is.

487
00:38:37,604 --> 00:38:38,604
Hmm...

488
00:38:38,854 --> 00:38:41,021
And he's not too bad looking either, is he?

489
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:42,054
Mum.

490
00:38:44,953 --> 00:38:47,120
Look. I know you're happy...

491
00:38:47,854 --> 00:38:50,654
but I don't want you getting too attached.

492
00:38:50,858 --> 00:38:52,525
He's not from this world.

493
00:38:53,105 --> 00:38:55,172
He's still figuring it all out.

494
00:38:55,753 --> 00:38:58,153
I don't want you to get heartbroken.

495
00:38:58,156 --> 00:38:59,156
Heartbroken?

496
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:02,868
Mum. This is the happiest I've been.

497
00:39:03,903 --> 00:39:05,303
ELIZABETH: Come here.

498
00:40:35,452 --> 00:40:36,452
No.

499
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:40,204
No way.

500
00:40:50,707 --> 00:40:51,974
(Front Door Closes)

501
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,210
Is that you, John?

502
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,755
Yes. It's me.

503
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:03,885
How was your day?

504
00:41:05,204 --> 00:41:06,704
Where is he?

505
00:41:08,151 --> 00:41:09,151
Who?

506
00:41:09,156 --> 00:41:10,156
Jacques?

507
00:41:11,356 --> 00:41:12,923
He's in the garden.

508
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:18,220
ELIZABETH: John?

509
00:41:20,752 --> 00:41:23,752
John, what's the matter?
Is something wrong?

510
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:30,422
(Whispering)
What are you doing?

511
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,500
They are getting too close.

512
00:41:32,753 --> 00:41:34,020
They're in love.

513
00:41:34,402 --> 00:41:35,402
Can't you see?

514
00:41:36,003 --> 00:41:37,436
Well, it can't go on.
It can't last.

515
00:41:37,653 --> 00:41:40,053
She's dying, for Christ's sake.

516
00:41:40,659 --> 00:41:42,692
It's the happiest she's been.

517
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,900
Now, you promise me that
you won't ruin it for her.

518
00:41:44,906 --> 00:41:45,906
- Ruin it?

519
00:41:45,908 --> 00:41:48,308
I am her father.
I'm supposed to protect her.

520
00:41:49,554 --> 00:41:51,554
Let her have her moment, John.

521
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,410
Let her have her moment!

522
00:42:09,954 --> 00:42:12,021
ZOE: When I'm up there...

523
00:42:14,852 --> 00:42:18,552
I mean, when I die...

524
00:42:21,657 --> 00:42:25,157
I want to be able to look down on Earth...

525
00:42:25,554 --> 00:42:27,554
and smile.

526
00:42:28,454 --> 00:42:30,487
How wonderful it is.

527
00:42:34,951 --> 00:42:36,951
It's beautiful.

528
00:42:50,052 --> 00:42:52,052
I'm not ready to die.

529
00:42:59,164 --> 00:43:01,831
ZOE: There's still so much I want to do.

530
00:43:06,674 --> 00:43:08,141
Only the body can die.

531
00:43:09,863 --> 00:43:11,863
The soul lives on.

532
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:28,296
I'll live among the stars.

533
00:43:29,162 --> 00:43:30,662
That's right.

534
00:43:45,464 --> 00:43:47,797
I worry about my Mum and Dad.

535
00:43:49,615 --> 00:43:52,082
How awful it must be to bury a child.

536
00:43:55,445 --> 00:43:57,578
Dad? He can take it.

537
00:44:00,113 --> 00:44:01,613
Mum?

538
00:44:02,966 --> 00:44:05,033
I'm not so sure.

539
00:44:09,311 --> 00:44:11,611
Everything will be okay.

540
00:44:33,215 --> 00:44:34,415
Have you been crying?

541
00:44:34,418 --> 00:44:35,818
- No.

542
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:40,261
He...

543
00:44:42,063 --> 00:44:43,196
He's in her room.

544
00:44:44,813 --> 00:44:46,880
They're just talking. I'm sure.

545
00:44:48,112 --> 00:44:50,645
Talking?
Yeah...right.

546
00:44:52,714 --> 00:44:53,914
Zoe's a good girl.

547
00:44:54,413 --> 00:44:56,446
She's never been that way.

548
00:44:57,213 --> 00:44:59,613
There's a first time for everything.

549
00:44:59,966 --> 00:45:01,633
That's the father in you.

550
00:45:02,112 --> 00:45:03,645
Every boy is a suspect.

551
00:45:03,812 --> 00:45:05,545
Yes, because every boy is.

552
00:45:06,062 --> 00:45:07,662
She'll be fine.

553
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:16,594
She thinks we won't cope.
When she's gone.

554
00:45:20,412 --> 00:45:22,012
We're a family.

555
00:45:22,613 --> 00:45:24,213
We'll stick together.

556
00:45:24,815 --> 00:45:26,548
And we'll fight and fight.

557
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:29,119
And we'll keep on fighting.

558
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:32,262
Don't worry.

559
00:46:46,757 --> 00:46:47,757
(Sneeze)

560
00:46:50,113 --> 00:46:51,113
Shit.

561
00:46:51,562 --> 00:46:52,562
Shit.

562
00:46:52,816 --> 00:46:53,816
Mum!

563
00:46:54,613 --> 00:46:56,113
Mum!

564
00:46:56,262 --> 00:46:57,429
- What do you need?

565
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:58,450
ZOE: A tissue.

566
00:46:58,663 --> 00:47:01,196
ELIZABETH: Oh, Jesus Christ!
Hang on.

567
00:47:05,363 --> 00:47:09,430
ELIZABETH: Put your head back.
Move your hand. It's alright.

568
00:47:10,363 --> 00:47:11,630
It's okay, darling.

569
00:47:12,114 --> 00:47:14,114
Hold it here.
I'm going to call your father, okay.

570
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,119
Hold it there.
Speak to her a minute.

571
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,535
(Crying)

572
00:47:27,214 --> 00:47:28,214
JOHN: Hi.

573
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:30,863
Oh.

574
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:32,549
She must be exhausted.

575
00:47:38,013 --> 00:47:39,013
I'm sorry.

576
00:47:40,763 --> 00:47:43,163
We've been up and about sightseeing.

577
00:47:44,012 --> 00:47:45,345
It's not your fault.

578
00:47:45,769 --> 00:47:47,902
You've been really good for her.

579
00:47:48,563 --> 00:47:52,030
As long as she's comfortable,
she'll be fine here.

580
00:47:52,415 --> 00:47:54,282
Getting a rest for a change.

581
00:47:54,563 --> 00:47:56,063
Are you going into work today?

582
00:47:56,064 --> 00:47:57,964
- No.
I'll work from home.

583
00:47:59,063 --> 00:48:00,563
Good.

584
00:48:09,313 --> 00:48:10,813
Jacques?

585
00:48:11,812 --> 00:48:13,945
Come for a drive.

586
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,353
Zoe is very fond of you.

587
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:24,020
She's my child.
I understand her.

588
00:49:28,002 --> 00:49:29,702
She's dying.

589
00:49:32,352 --> 00:49:36,885
She's grabbing onto life with both hands
and you make her feel like she's...

590
00:49:36,903 --> 00:49:37,903
winning.

591
00:49:41,155 --> 00:49:42,888
It's more than I ever did.

592
00:49:45,307 --> 00:49:47,440
It's the happiest I've seen her.

593
00:49:49,608 --> 00:49:50,608
I'm grateful.

594
00:49:54,357 --> 00:49:55,824
But I have a question.

595
00:49:59,201 --> 00:50:00,601
Who are you, Jacques?

596
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:06,068
Where are you from?
And what the hell are you doing here?

597
00:50:06,407 --> 00:50:07,407
An Astronaut?

598
00:50:07,411 --> 00:50:08,411
(Scoffs)

599
00:50:09,403 --> 00:50:10,936
I don't quite buy that.

600
00:50:13,858 --> 00:50:17,291
That night when you helped with
the salad for dinner...

601
00:50:17,355 --> 00:50:20,155
I watched you cut clean through your hand.

602
00:50:22,354 --> 00:50:23,354
Clean through.

603
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:25,785
Not a drop of blood.

604
00:50:28,252 --> 00:50:31,285
Yesterday, I came here to look
for the remains of your ship.

605
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:32,654
Nothing.

606
00:50:34,356 --> 00:50:35,889
You explain that to me!

607
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:42,336
I mean, how can something like that
just disappear?

608
00:50:42,702 --> 00:50:43,902
Huh?

609
00:50:46,658 --> 00:50:48,191
Who the hell are you?!!

610
00:50:48,611 --> 00:50:52,211
And what the hell do you want
with my daughter?!!

611
00:50:52,253 --> 00:50:53,520
Let go of me, John.

612
00:50:53,953 --> 00:50:54,953
Calm down.

613
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:02,075
JACQUES: I know you're hurting, John.

614
00:51:02,104 --> 00:51:03,437
I know you're angry.

615
00:51:04,252 --> 00:51:05,752
I'm sorry.

616
00:51:06,703 --> 00:51:08,703
You deserve to know the truth.

617
00:51:10,502 --> 00:51:14,902
JOHN: Then you tell me the truth.

618
00:51:15,307 --> 00:51:17,574
I'm not really an astronaut, John.

619
00:51:18,653 --> 00:51:20,886
I wasn't born in space.

620
00:51:23,452 --> 00:51:24,452
The truth is...

621
00:51:25,967 --> 00:51:28,600
I'm not from this planet at all.

622
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:30,511
JOHN: No.

623
00:51:35,618 --> 00:51:38,685
The place I call home is far
away from here.

624
00:51:39,307 --> 00:51:41,140
Way beyond this galaxy.

625
00:51:41,457 --> 00:51:43,524
Way beyond your stars.

626
00:51:45,957 --> 00:51:47,290
I'm what you call...

627
00:51:48,202 --> 00:51:49,702
"Alien".

628
00:51:52,103 --> 00:51:53,170
JOHN: Your hand?

629
00:51:54,902 --> 00:51:56,302
Yes.

630
00:51:56,656 --> 00:51:58,156
We don't bleed.

631
00:51:58,854 --> 00:52:00,521
We don't feel pain.

632
00:52:02,094 --> 00:52:03,127
JOHN: This is crazy.

633
00:52:03,303 --> 00:52:06,103
Where do you think humans
came from, John?

634
00:52:06,604 --> 00:52:09,004
We brought you here, to this planet.

635
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:11,663
A million years ago.

636
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:17,080
We gave you basic technology and knowledge
and you thrived.

637
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:19,605
You became self sufficient.

638
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:21,003
Independent.

639
00:52:23,005 --> 00:52:24,572
Now we need you.

640
00:52:25,152 --> 00:52:26,719
I don't understand.

641
00:52:27,085 --> 00:52:31,352
JACQUES: I've been sent here because
our people are dying out.

642
00:52:31,854 --> 00:52:33,454
You want to invade our planet?

643
00:52:33,505 --> 00:52:34,505
- No.

644
00:52:35,506 --> 00:52:38,539
This isn't one of your
science-fiction films.

645
00:52:38,703 --> 00:52:39,703
Well, what then?

646
00:52:40,503 --> 00:52:43,203
I was sent here to find a Queen.

647
00:52:43,602 --> 00:52:45,135
A Queen for our people.

648
00:52:46,165 --> 00:52:47,165
My Queen.

649
00:52:50,102 --> 00:52:51,102
Zoe?

650
00:52:51,103 --> 00:52:52,103
JACQUES: Yes.

651
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:53,303
You want Zoe?

652
00:52:53,953 --> 00:52:58,220
JACQUES: Together we will begin to
repopulate our world.

653
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:02,202
She's Dying!

654
00:53:02,406 --> 00:53:03,539
You sick bastard!

655
00:53:07,202 --> 00:53:08,969
JOHN: I'm going to kill you!

656
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:10,320
Let go of me, John.

657
00:53:10,503 --> 00:53:12,603
You piece of shit!

658
00:53:13,353 --> 00:53:15,320
JACQUES: Calm down, John.

659
00:53:15,853 --> 00:53:16,853
Calm down.

660
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:19,841
(Straining)

661
00:53:23,403 --> 00:53:24,603
JACQUES: I can cure her, John.

662
00:53:24,653 --> 00:53:28,053
I knew I shouldn't have invited you
into my home. You bastard.

663
00:53:28,203 --> 00:53:29,503
JACQUES: John, I'm serious...

664
00:53:30,653 --> 00:53:31,653
I can cure her.

665
00:53:32,102 --> 00:53:34,369
JACQUES: She'll be as good as new.

666
00:53:34,752 --> 00:53:36,619
You just have to let her go.

667
00:53:39,303 --> 00:53:40,303
With you?

668
00:53:40,357 --> 00:53:42,157
Back to you world?

669
00:53:42,357 --> 00:53:43,357
JACQUES: Yes.

670
00:53:44,357 --> 00:53:46,124
And if I refuse?

671
00:53:49,403 --> 00:53:51,470
JACQUES: You've seen her, John.

672
00:53:52,107 --> 00:53:53,774
She's going to die, soon.

673
00:53:55,252 --> 00:53:57,785
JACQUES: This way she doesn't have to.

674
00:53:58,153 --> 00:54:00,286
This way she can have a life.

675
00:54:03,515 --> 00:54:06,748
And your world?
What's it like?

676
00:54:07,204 --> 00:54:11,404
Compared to ours, why is it so much better?
You are dying out!

677
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:15,269
JACQUES: Our plight, is simply
one of genetics.

678
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:18,456
John, she'll be a Queen.

679
00:54:19,151 --> 00:54:20,551
JACQUES: Our saviour.

680
00:54:21,455 --> 00:54:25,755
JACQUES: She'll have everything she wants
and everything she needs.

681
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,060
And if she wants to come home?

682
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:39,785
JACQUES: I'm afraid that wouldn't
be possible.

683
00:54:53,554 --> 00:54:56,321
How do I know that you're telling
the truth?

684
00:54:56,352 --> 00:54:58,719
JACQUES: Take her to any of your medics.

685
00:54:59,552 --> 00:55:01,619
They will verify her condition.

686
00:55:03,054 --> 00:55:05,321
JACQUES: She'll be as good as new.

687
00:55:05,952 --> 00:55:08,485
You only have to agree.

688
00:55:12,007 --> 00:55:14,107
And you can cure her?

689
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:15,401
JACQUES: Yes.

690
00:55:21,655 --> 00:55:22,655
Yes.

691
00:55:23,037 --> 00:55:24,437
Yes. Yes. Yes.

692
00:55:26,752 --> 00:55:27,752
Yes.

693
00:55:27,755 --> 00:55:29,055
You cure her.

694
00:55:29,303 --> 00:55:31,203
You cure her.

695
00:55:32,253 --> 00:55:33,253
(Cries)

696
00:55:33,752 --> 00:55:34,752
JACQUES: Yes.

697
00:55:39,256 --> 00:55:40,256
Yes.

698
00:56:00,952 --> 00:56:03,019
ELIZABETH: Are you still awake?

699
00:56:05,452 --> 00:56:08,519
I'm taking Zoe to the Doctor
in the morning.

700
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:10,920
ELIZABETH: Okay.

701
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,961
DOCTOR: Mr and Mrs Armstrong.

702
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,777
This is quite remarkable.

703
00:57:19,259 --> 00:57:21,659
There's really no way to explain it.

704
00:57:22,411 --> 00:57:23,911
Zoe.

705
00:57:24,415 --> 00:57:26,915
Your leukaemia has cleared up.

706
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,063
It's gone.

707
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,632
I don't mean into remission.

708
00:57:32,723 --> 00:57:35,356
I mean it's disappeared completely.

709
00:57:35,811 --> 00:57:37,278
It's quite miraculous.

710
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:42,329
Your white cell count is normal.
And so is your general cell structure.

711
00:57:42,411 --> 00:57:48,078
Blood oxygen levels are regulated and there
are no abnormalities in the bone marrow.

712
00:57:50,259 --> 00:57:51,792
This is very good news.

713
00:57:53,611 --> 00:57:56,044
We'll want to keep an eye on you for
the next few months.

714
00:57:56,112 --> 00:57:59,712
But from what I can see,
you've made a full recovery.

715
00:58:00,061 --> 00:58:01,561
Spectacular.

716
00:58:02,709 --> 00:58:05,776
Someone up there really loves you.

717
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,740
(Front door opens)

718
00:58:23,745 --> 00:58:25,412
We've got her back.

719
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:28,040
We've got our baby back!

720
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:55,127
You kept your word.

721
00:59:03,364 --> 00:59:04,864
She's cured.

722
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,042
The cancer has gone.

723
00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:15,909
So, that's it?

724
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:21,977
When will you take her?

725
00:59:25,511 --> 00:59:28,111
I'm not a monster, John.

726
00:59:28,509 --> 00:59:30,642
It's Zoe's birthday in two days.

727
00:59:31,762 --> 00:59:33,729
I'll wait until after.

728
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:37,810
Nineteen.

729
00:59:43,009 --> 00:59:44,742
What if she refuses?

730
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,860
We made a deal, John.

731
00:59:46,864 --> 00:59:50,897
What if she refuses?

732
01:00:14,045 --> 01:00:15,578
Isn't it amazing?

733
01:00:16,092 --> 01:00:17,492
It is.

734
01:00:19,143 --> 01:00:20,343
I'm going to live.

735
01:00:22,743 --> 01:00:24,543
I'm actually going to live.

736
01:00:26,344 --> 01:00:27,911
Can you believe it?

737
01:00:34,493 --> 01:00:35,493
What is it?

738
01:00:36,693 --> 01:00:39,160
There's something I need to tell you.

739
01:00:41,743 --> 01:00:42,743
Okay.

740
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,343
I'm going to leave soon.

741
01:00:50,794 --> 01:00:52,294
I have to go.

742
01:00:54,493 --> 01:00:55,893
How soon?

743
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,227
The day after tomorrow.

744
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,126
It's my birthday tomorrow, Jacques.

745
01:01:09,493 --> 01:01:11,126
Is it my mum and dad?

746
01:01:11,243 --> 01:01:12,476
Are they making you leave?

747
01:01:12,692 --> 01:01:13,692
- No.

748
01:01:14,543 --> 01:01:15,543
It's not them.

749
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,242
Then why do you want to go?

750
01:01:21,243 --> 01:01:22,443
I have to.

751
01:01:23,142 --> 01:01:24,542
I must.

752
01:01:27,793 --> 01:01:28,993
I can go with you?

753
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:32,442
We can go together.
- Zoe.

754
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:34,542
Listen to me.

755
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:40,509
There's something I need to tell you.

756
01:01:40,793 --> 01:01:43,860
Something about who I am
and where I'm from.

757
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:45,876
What I'm doing here.

758
01:01:47,643 --> 01:01:48,643
Okay.

759
01:01:49,642 --> 01:01:52,242
You might find this hard to understand.

760
01:01:55,042 --> 01:01:57,042
Jacques?

761
01:01:57,693 --> 01:01:58,693
Just tell me.

762
01:02:16,043 --> 01:02:19,176
(Inaudible dialogue)

763
01:03:04,793 --> 01:03:05,793
(Slap)

764
01:03:10,343 --> 01:03:11,676
How could you do?

765
01:03:13,238 --> 01:03:16,538
How could you sign her life away without
consulting me?

766
01:03:17,682 --> 01:03:19,349
That's our baby.

767
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:22,083
She's our baby!

768
01:03:28,484 --> 01:03:30,917
Now you see why I have to go.

769
01:03:33,032 --> 01:03:34,665
I have no choice.

770
01:03:49,236 --> 01:03:51,569
ELIZABETH: What do we do now, John?

771
01:03:52,633 --> 01:03:54,333
Who do we call?

772
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:57,615
For now, we do nothing.

773
01:03:59,082 --> 01:04:00,749
We sit tight and we wait.

774
01:04:01,663 --> 01:04:03,330
ELIZABETH: Wait for what?

775
01:04:03,983 --> 01:04:06,416
It's Zoe's birthday tomorrow.

776
01:04:08,433 --> 01:04:11,100
He said that he'd wait until after that.

777
01:04:12,484 --> 01:04:14,184
ELIZABETH: How soon after?

778
01:04:15,184 --> 01:04:16,384
I don't know.

779
01:04:17,483 --> 01:04:19,550
ELIZABETH: We have to tell her, John.

780
01:04:19,583 --> 01:04:22,183
We've got to tell her who he really is.

781
01:04:22,433 --> 01:04:23,566
We have no choice.

782
01:04:24,832 --> 01:04:28,632
We can't do that. We have to keep
it between ourselves.

783
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,640
We have to find a way to get him
him away from her.

784
01:04:33,032 --> 01:04:35,432
ELIZABETH: How could I be so stupid?

785
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,498
We let him into our home.

786
01:04:39,482 --> 01:04:42,615
We let that alien into our home.

787
01:04:44,782 --> 01:04:47,515
ELIZABETH: What are we going to do, John?

788
01:04:48,883 --> 01:04:50,616
We have to fight him, Liz.

789
01:04:50,635 --> 01:04:54,468
We have to fight him to keep
our little girl.

790
01:04:56,881 --> 01:04:57,881
Come here.

791
01:06:23,303 --> 01:06:24,303
Mum?

792
01:06:26,954 --> 01:06:28,954
What are you doing up?
It's 6:00am.

793
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:30,471
I'm baking you a cake.

794
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:31,654
Happy birthday!

795
01:06:37,453 --> 01:06:38,586
ZOE: Thanks, mum.

796
01:06:41,203 --> 01:06:42,203
Coffee?

797
01:06:42,402 --> 01:06:43,402
ZOE: Yeah.

798
01:07:01,453 --> 01:07:02,720
You're so grown up.

799
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:06,285
I can't believe this day has come around
so quickly.

800
01:07:06,352 --> 01:07:07,352
- I know.

801
01:07:07,503 --> 01:07:10,570
When I gave birth to you, you were
this big.

802
01:07:13,953 --> 01:07:15,353
I'm so proud of you, Zoe.

803
01:07:16,853 --> 01:07:20,686
Everything you've been through.
The leukaemia and everything.

804
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:21,702
- Mum.

805
01:07:22,152 --> 01:07:23,152
I know.

806
01:07:23,153 --> 01:07:24,153
I know.

807
01:07:24,303 --> 01:07:25,870
I get so emotional.

808
01:07:27,452 --> 01:07:29,385
You're my one and only child.

809
01:07:29,453 --> 01:07:30,853
It's natural.

810
01:07:34,102 --> 01:07:37,469
Your father has invited the neighbours
for your birthday lunch.

811
01:07:37,505 --> 01:07:38,838
Hope you don't mind.

812
01:07:39,102 --> 01:07:40,235
- No. Not at all.

813
01:07:44,153 --> 01:07:46,220
Doing anything fun later?

814
01:07:47,553 --> 01:07:48,686
Yas will be here.

815
01:07:48,704 --> 01:07:51,837
So, we'll probably go and get a drink
with some of my school friends.

816
01:07:51,853 --> 01:07:53,453
Sounds nice.

817
01:07:55,456 --> 01:07:59,056
I'm so glad to spend another birthday
with you, Zoe.

818
01:08:00,153 --> 01:08:01,153
I love you.

819
01:08:01,903 --> 01:08:03,570
ZOE: I love you too, mum.

820
01:08:20,253 --> 01:08:23,286
(Spanish accent) KATE: It's okay, you know.
He's does not know how to dance.

821
01:08:23,353 --> 01:08:26,686
No rhythm. But it's fine. My family
eventually teach him.

822
01:08:26,753 --> 01:08:28,886
You know. A little bit of salsa!

823
01:08:28,981 --> 01:08:30,848
And now he moves a bit more.

824
01:08:30,865 --> 01:08:32,465
We call him 'Scarecrow'.

825
01:08:32,615 --> 01:08:34,548
Or 'Giraffe on rollerblades'.

826
01:08:35,503 --> 01:08:38,703
How did you two meet?
You're a cute couple.

827
01:08:39,753 --> 01:08:42,120
Oh, Jacques isn't my boyfriend.

828
01:08:43,004 --> 01:08:44,071
Ah, he's your...

829
01:08:44,743 --> 01:08:47,043
No. No. No.
He's Zoe's. Sort of.

830
01:08:48,093 --> 01:08:50,293
Oh. I'm sorry, Yasmin. I thought he...

831
01:08:50,813 --> 01:08:54,313
TIM: Don't worry, Yasmin. She's always
putting her foot in it. Aren't you darling?

832
01:08:54,313 --> 01:08:56,980
- Yes. It's true.
Ah, baby. One moment.

833
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:58,766
There we are.

834
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:00,514
Cheese puffs!

835
01:09:00,563 --> 01:09:01,563
Hey!

836
01:09:01,614 --> 01:09:02,614
Your weight.

837
01:09:03,812 --> 01:09:05,279
(Whispering)
Stop it!

838
01:09:05,364 --> 01:09:07,331
YASMIN: I love your dress, Kate.
It's gorgeous.

839
01:09:07,364 --> 01:09:10,264
Thank you. Tim got it for me actually.
- I did? When?

840
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:12,670
I picked it up with his credit card.

841
01:09:12,763 --> 01:09:13,763
(Laugh)

842
01:09:14,313 --> 01:09:17,146
Listen, that's the beginning of the end.
You want to watch that.

843
01:09:17,212 --> 01:09:18,412
There you go.
- No, Thank you.

844
01:09:19,162 --> 01:09:20,562
TIM: Kate's pregnant.

845
01:09:20,563 --> 01:09:21,563
What?

846
01:09:21,612 --> 01:09:23,412
She's pregnant.
KATE: Yes.

847
01:09:23,413 --> 01:09:24,946
That is wonderful news!

848
01:09:25,413 --> 01:09:26,413
Come here.

849
01:09:28,713 --> 01:09:29,846
When are you due?

850
01:09:30,362 --> 01:09:33,329
We're only in the first trimester.
Seven months to go.

851
01:09:33,414 --> 01:09:35,247
Congratulations.
-Thank you.

852
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:36,450
JOHN: Welcome aboard.

853
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,500
Thanks.

854
01:09:37,514 --> 01:09:39,447
Have you thought of any names?

855
01:09:39,562 --> 01:09:43,029
Alejandro.
TIM: We're not sure about that one, yet.

856
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,040
Enrique.

857
01:09:44,212 --> 01:09:45,212
Enrique!!!

858
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:46,314
- Enrique.

859
01:09:46,513 --> 01:09:48,180
Listen, how about 'Josh'?

860
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,200
- Josh?
- I like Josh.

861
01:09:49,612 --> 01:09:53,145
TIM: It's nice. Exactly.
It's a good quality name.

862
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:54,150
- Josh?

863
01:09:54,170 --> 01:09:56,437
What's wrong with 'Josh'?
- Baby, we talked about this.

864
01:09:56,866 --> 01:09:59,166
Guillermo!
Alejandro, maybe.

865
01:09:59,313 --> 01:10:00,313
TIM: Gelmo?

866
01:10:00,962 --> 01:10:01,962
KATE: 'Gelmo'?

867
01:10:02,213 --> 01:10:03,813
KATE: G-U-I-L-L-E-R-M-O!

868
01:10:03,913 --> 01:10:06,713
ZOE: An orange juice for you, kate.
- Thank you, Zoe. Happy Birthday!

869
01:10:07,114 --> 01:10:08,114
ZOE: Thankyou.

870
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,163
Thank you.

871
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:11,164
JOHN: You alright?

872
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,670
ZOE: Yeah, fine.
- Everything good?

873
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,680
ZOE: Yeah. I feel fine.

874
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,100
KATE: It's so good to see you up
and about again.

875
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,500
TIM: Happy birthday, Zoe.

876
01:10:17,564 --> 01:10:18,564
ZOE: Thank you, Tim.

877
01:10:18,963 --> 01:10:22,363
KATE: We just met your gorgeous
boyfriend, Jacques.

878
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,663
KATE: Mmm...Yes...

879
01:10:23,814 --> 01:10:24,814
ZOE: Yeah.

880
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:25,919
KATE: Eh, John?

881
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
JOHN: Yes.

882
01:10:29,714 --> 01:10:30,714
Ah, listen.

883
01:10:30,812 --> 01:10:31,812
(Whispering)
The cake.

884
01:10:36,413 --> 01:10:37,546
KATE: Go, go, go.
- Okay.

885
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,896
(Applause)

886
01:10:42,913 --> 01:10:44,846
(Applause)
Happy birthday!!!

887
01:10:44,913 --> 01:10:47,146
(Cheering)
Happy birthday!!!

888
01:10:56,078 --> 01:10:57,078
(Cheering)

889
01:10:59,772 --> 01:11:00,905
Just a few words.

890
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:03,523
To Zoe.

891
01:11:04,794 --> 01:11:06,827
Our wonderful daughter.

892
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:13,527
Zoe has been a beacon of light
in our lives.

893
01:11:15,843 --> 01:11:18,876
She's fought through hell and high water.

894
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:22,592
And always with a smile on her face.

895
01:11:24,042 --> 01:11:25,442
She's an inspiration.

896
01:11:25,693 --> 01:11:28,526
A rock. You are a rock.

897
01:11:29,893 --> 01:11:32,426
Remission after remission.

898
01:11:33,743 --> 01:11:35,243
And we are...

899
01:11:35,243 --> 01:11:39,643
so glad that we can spend another
birthday with you.

900
01:11:41,794 --> 01:11:43,294
Zoe!

901
01:11:43,392 --> 01:11:44,892
Jesus Christ.

902
01:11:45,143 --> 01:11:46,643
Elizabeth, please.
Please.

903
01:11:47,342 --> 01:11:48,342
No, John.

904
01:11:49,446 --> 01:11:50,579
To hell with him.

905
01:11:51,592 --> 01:11:56,192
I won't stand by and watch while he tries
to take our daughter away.

906
01:11:56,293 --> 01:11:57,360
What's going on?

907
01:11:57,593 --> 01:11:58,593
Him.

908
01:11:58,597 --> 01:11:59,997
That thing.

909
01:12:00,943 --> 01:12:02,376
That's what's going on.

910
01:12:02,392 --> 01:12:03,392
- Elizabeth.

911
01:12:03,393 --> 01:12:07,060
We invite you into our home
we feed you, we clothe you

912
01:12:07,913 --> 01:12:11,580
and you betray us by trying to steal
our daughter away from us.

913
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:13,445
Damn you, Jacques.

914
01:12:14,544 --> 01:12:16,511
Who the hell do you think you are?

915
01:12:16,543 --> 01:12:18,176
Elizabeth, this is not the time.

916
01:12:18,197 --> 01:12:19,330
This is the time!

917
01:12:19,563 --> 01:12:21,530
This is the fucking time!

918
01:12:23,293 --> 01:12:26,893
This looks like a family thing.
I think we should go.

919
01:12:27,096 --> 01:12:28,496
JOHN: Tim, I'm sorry.

920
01:12:29,493 --> 01:12:30,493
TIM: It's okay.

921
01:12:30,895 --> 01:12:33,428
Would you mind letting yourselves out?
- No problem.

922
01:12:33,442 --> 01:12:35,042
TIM: Go. go. Come on.

923
01:12:35,292 --> 01:12:36,892
JOHN: Kate. Tim. Thanks.

924
01:12:36,944 --> 01:12:38,344
JOHN: Give us a call.

925
01:12:41,592 --> 01:12:42,992
Now, Elizabeth.

926
01:12:43,443 --> 01:12:44,443
Calm down.

927
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,643
I will not calm down!

928
01:12:47,192 --> 01:12:48,192
ZOE: Mum?

929
01:12:48,693 --> 01:12:50,026
YASMIN: Should I go?

930
01:12:50,443 --> 01:12:52,510
No, Yas. Stay right where you are.

931
01:12:52,543 --> 01:12:56,810
Your dad found out some very interesting
things about Jacques.

932
01:12:57,142 --> 01:12:59,609
I told you not to say anything, John.

933
01:12:59,895 --> 01:13:01,395
She's my wife.

934
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:05,449
He's an alien.
He's not an astronaut.

935
01:13:06,151 --> 01:13:07,818
He's from another planet!

936
01:13:08,443 --> 01:13:10,243
He's here to kidnap you.

937
01:13:10,843 --> 01:13:15,376
He cured your leukaemia and made you better
so he can take you back to his planet.

938
01:13:15,443 --> 01:13:17,576
Or wherever the hell he is from.

939
01:13:18,445 --> 01:13:20,812
Your father made a deal with him in secret.

940
01:13:20,893 --> 01:13:21,893
But I'm sorry.

941
01:13:22,543 --> 01:13:23,810
We can't have that.

942
01:13:24,311 --> 01:13:26,911
It's time for you to leave, Jacques.

943
01:13:27,592 --> 01:13:28,592
YASMIN: Crazy.

944
01:13:30,942 --> 01:13:32,542
We had to tell you, Zoe.

945
01:13:33,395 --> 01:13:34,862
You made a deal?

946
01:13:35,792 --> 01:13:36,859
I had no choice.

947
01:13:37,294 --> 01:13:38,794
You were dying!

948
01:13:40,293 --> 01:13:41,926
I know who he is.

949
01:13:43,443 --> 01:13:44,843
I know all about him.

950
01:13:45,145 --> 01:13:46,712
About where he's from.

951
01:13:47,293 --> 01:13:49,060
What are you saying?
- I'm saying...

952
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:51,137
Jacques has told me everything.

953
01:13:52,293 --> 01:13:55,026
And I've decided that I'm going with him.

954
01:13:56,693 --> 01:13:57,693
What!?

955
01:13:58,343 --> 01:13:59,610
I'm going with him.

956
01:14:03,594 --> 01:14:05,961
No. This is ludicrous.
No. I won't allow it.

957
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:08,393
Over my dead body!

958
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:11,792
Elizabeth?

959
01:14:12,546 --> 01:14:13,613
Stay back, John!

960
01:14:15,694 --> 01:14:17,161
Don't defend him, Zoe.

961
01:14:18,843 --> 01:14:20,843
JACQUES: Put the knife down, Elizabeth.

962
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:21,850
- Like hell I will.

963
01:14:22,392 --> 01:14:23,592
Stop it.

964
01:14:23,942 --> 01:14:25,142
Just stop it.

965
01:14:27,643 --> 01:14:29,576
ZOE: I'm not a child anymore.

966
01:14:30,593 --> 01:14:31,593
Mum.

967
01:14:31,594 --> 01:14:32,594
Dad.

968
01:14:33,542 --> 01:14:34,542
I love you.

969
01:14:35,143 --> 01:14:36,976
But, you know as well as I do

970
01:14:37,044 --> 01:14:38,844
I should be dead right now.

971
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,809
I've spent years of my life fighting it.

972
01:14:42,892 --> 01:14:45,692
Remission after remission after remission.

973
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,700
And...

974
01:14:49,233 --> 01:14:51,033
I'm tired.

975
01:14:53,433 --> 01:14:55,933
I'm so tired, Mum.

976
01:15:00,683 --> 01:15:01,683
Jacques.

977
01:15:02,883 --> 01:15:03,883
Whoever he is.

978
01:15:05,432 --> 01:15:06,832
Wherever he's from...

979
01:15:07,934 --> 01:15:11,667
He fell out of the sky and he changed
my life.

980
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:15,133
He made me want to live again.

981
01:15:15,534 --> 01:15:17,301
He cured me. What more can I ask for?

982
01:15:17,341 --> 01:15:18,841
I love him.

983
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:24,752
That's right.

984
01:15:26,831 --> 01:15:28,331
I love him.

985
01:15:29,733 --> 01:15:30,733
So...

986
01:15:30,882 --> 01:15:32,849
If my only options are

987
01:15:34,282 --> 01:15:37,082
Cancer and 'Chemo'...

988
01:15:37,584 --> 01:15:39,917
Or life with Jacques...

989
01:15:42,433 --> 01:15:43,966
Can you blame me?

990
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:46,932
I choose life.

991
01:15:48,132 --> 01:15:49,932
I choose him.

992
01:15:51,532 --> 01:15:54,132
Because I'm so scared...

993
01:15:55,082 --> 01:15:57,149
of the alternative.

994
01:15:59,332 --> 01:16:01,265
I don't want to die.

995
01:16:02,682 --> 01:16:04,415
So, I've made my choice.

996
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:08,333
So, this is how it's going to end?

997
01:16:10,784 --> 01:16:12,784
I need you to accept it.

998
01:17:00,068 --> 01:17:02,135
JACQUES: It's time.

999
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:09,627
Is this the place?

1000
01:18:12,272 --> 01:18:13,772
JACQUES: Yes

1001
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:15,523
It is.

1002
01:18:21,922 --> 01:18:23,822
What are we looking for?

1003
01:18:25,772 --> 01:18:27,339
Can you hear it?

1004
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:34,297
Oh my god. John. Look.

1005
01:18:47,578 --> 01:18:49,378
Is that what I think it is?

1006
01:18:51,225 --> 01:18:52,725
It's my people.

1007
01:18:53,872 --> 01:18:55,372
They're here.

1008
01:19:28,522 --> 01:19:29,655
We love you, Zoe.

1009
01:19:34,342 --> 01:19:35,875
We love you so much.

1010
01:19:40,252 --> 01:19:41,752
I'm sorry.

1011
01:19:46,202 --> 01:19:48,402
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

1012
01:19:56,043 --> 01:19:57,876
Please don't be sad.

1013
01:19:59,143 --> 01:20:00,643
Mum?

1014
01:20:04,393 --> 01:20:06,526
We'll think about you every day.

1015
01:20:08,692 --> 01:20:11,425
And you'll still be our
little baby.

1016
01:20:27,872 --> 01:20:29,672
You'll see me.

1017
01:20:31,925 --> 01:20:34,925
When you look up at the stars.

1018
01:20:37,929 --> 01:20:38,929
I love you.

1019
01:21:01,178 --> 01:21:02,578
Don't go, Zoe.

1020
01:21:03,423 --> 01:21:05,690
What am I going to do without you?

1021
01:21:07,103 --> 01:21:08,503
Thankyou.

1022
01:21:09,154 --> 01:21:12,821
For being the best friend a person
could ever ask for.

1023
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,883
You held me up.

1024
01:21:17,731 --> 01:21:19,631
Supported me.

1025
01:21:23,432 --> 01:21:25,299
Take care of yourself. Okay?

1026
01:21:27,336 --> 01:21:28,903
I love you, Zoe.

1027
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:34,580
I love you, too.

1028
01:21:40,463 --> 01:21:42,063
It's time.

1029
01:22:16,461 --> 01:22:19,528
JACQUES: You might want to step back a bit.

1030
01:22:55,015 --> 01:22:56,515
I'm ready.

1031
01:22:57,582 --> 01:22:59,149
Hold me tight.

1032
01:22:59,212 --> 01:23:00,912
Don't let go.

1033
01:23:09,013 --> 01:23:10,513
Don't let go!

1034
01:23:11,712 --> 01:23:13,212
I won't!

1035
01:23:13,661 --> 01:23:16,161
(Deep rumbling sound)

1036
