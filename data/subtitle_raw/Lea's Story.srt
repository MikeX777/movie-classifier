00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:20,570
RSG Release Team

2
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,697
Wait...

3
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,698
Later!

4
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,993
Careful, it'll get crumpled.

5
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,745
Just hold your arm straight.

6
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,255
And now...

7
00:02:52,672 --> 00:03:00,221
Here are the candidates in the
talent portion of the competition.

8
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,891
And our first candidate for today is...

9
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,769
Arlina Delos Santos!

10
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:18,823
Excuse me...

11
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,783
Excuse me...

12
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,828
Have a drink.

13
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,583
Don't be nervous.

14
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,586
Remember, just keep on going.

15
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,713
We're here to have fun.

16
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:39,928
Remember, it's what's inside
you that counts, okay?

17
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,680
Not your looks.

18
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,681
Alright.

19
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,807
Go for it!

20
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,266
Yes, Mommy.

21
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:48,728
Ma'am, my child is ready!
She'll join and sing now.

22
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,855
Just stay over there.

23
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,065
I'll call you when it's her turn.

24
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:54,150
Stop touching that! For crying out loud!

25
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,361
That gown cost me 2,000 pesos!
So, you better win.

26
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,279
Beat all those other kids!

27
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,700
And the next one to present her talent,

28
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,119
is candidate number 7.

29
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:09,624
She belongs to section Pussycat
under Miss Maglinao's kinder class.

30
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,418
She's 7 years old.

31
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:13,795
And her favorite subject is...

32
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,088
Wow! Math!

33
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,715
Here she is...

34
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:21,344
Maria Nathalia Bustamante Gascon.

35
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,351
Mommy's tummy was big and round!

36
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,813
What's that?! My brother Ojie pondered.

37
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,774
A ball? A basketball?

38
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,818
No, it's something else.

39
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,486
Maybe a little toy?

40
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,530
No, it's a bundle of joy.

41
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,284
What's inside, Mommy?

42
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,369
A surprise I offer.

43
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,331
The surprise turned out to be me!

44
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,337
How could the ball become a baby?

45
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,006
Mother breaks into joyous laughter.

46
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,299
When you grow a little older...

47
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,800
You will surely discover.

48
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,015
You taught her all that?

49
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,933
My goodness, that will never win!

50
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,437
Hurry up, they're lining up
for the graduation march.

51
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,438
What's wrong?

52
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,106
She wants to join the other kids now.

53
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,608
Finally! Then, hurry up.

54
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,817
Let's go, they're about to march.

55
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,693
How about you guys?

56
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,111
Hurry now!

57
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,614
You should have recited another piece.

58
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,574
Because you'll never win with that.

59
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,702
It's not a big deal if you don't make it.

60
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,621
This isn't about looks anyway.

61
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,292
Then why the heck join a beauty contest
if you're not being judged for your beauty?

62
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,211
Brother!

63
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:38,963
Give me that cap so I can finally graduate.

64
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:07,033
Here are the judges' decision
for our Miss Kindergarten contest...

65
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,869
Let's start with our special awards.

66
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:14,666
The judges have chosen the
Best in Costume and Miss Talent.

67
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,712
And the special award
for Best in Costume goes to...

68
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,255
Stop complaining.

69
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,966
From Section Elephant under Ms. Zenaida Mendoza...

70
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:27,178
Candidate number 1, Arlina Delos Santos.

71
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:37,564
And the Ms. Talent awardee comes from
Section Giraffe under Ms. Louie Cruz...

72
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,066
- Candidate number 4...
- That must be your lousy poem.

73
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,860
Erika Guevara!

74
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,785
And now ladies and gentlemen...

75
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:55,290
The winner of the much awaited Ms. Kinder award...

76
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,543
She comes from Section Pussycat.

77
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,503
I'm sure you already know who she is!

78
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,006
Candidate number 7.

79
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,134
Maria Nathalia Bustamante Gascon!

80
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,389
Okay! You did great!

81
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,976
Yes! Yes!

82
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:16,853
Give me that.

83
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,824
Believe it or not, Maya won by unanimous decision.

84
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,205
She really stood out among the other candidates.

85
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:38,583
- Ding, get the sauce for that.
- Sure, there's some over there.

86
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:39,501
I'll get the hotdogs.

87
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,877
Excuse me.

88
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,964
Mom, my friends.

89
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,550
Give them something to eat. Feel at home, okay?

90
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,386
Find a spot outside, okay?

91
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,930
Can you bring this outside for the kids?
Give me that.

92
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,223
- I'll take care of this.
- Okay.

93
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,684
As I was saying...

94
00:07:56,643 --> 00:08:00,397
My mother and my brother's father got married.

95
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,315
Then they split up.

96
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,734
My gosh Maya, that's bad!

97
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:10,990
My mother says when God joins two people together,
no one can break them apart.

98
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,118
How did God get in the picture?

99
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,204
Because it's God who marries people.

100
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,205
That isn't true!

101
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:21,042
My mother and her husband
were married by a town mayor.

102
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,629
The mayor of Abucay. You can even ask my father.

103
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,839
Dad!

104
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,760
Mom and Ojie's father were married
by the mayor of Abucay right?

105
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,720
Maya!

106
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,517
I want to sponsor Maya in the
Johnson & Johnson's search for the

107
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,186
Prince and Princess of Manila 1998!

108
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,147
- This is a huge deal!
- There's no more ice cream, Mom!

109
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,773
- You'll get a lot of money!
- I already called the store.

110
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,483
- There's a cash prize!
- But that takes time!

111
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,068
- The ice cream will come!
- There's an educational plan!

112
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,948
So young and you're already spreading gossip.

113
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,617
But, I'm just telling the truth!

114
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,620
Still, there are things that
you can't tell other peope!

115
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:58,955
You must be ashamed!

116
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,541
Mommy said you shouldn't be ashamed of the truth.

117
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,084
What if you stole something,
won't you be ashamed of it?

118
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,338
Mommy said, you should never do what is shameful!

119
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,380
Ding!

120
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,759
Ding!

121
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,179
Your mother's on the phone. She's raving mad.

122
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,014
Maya, be careful!

123
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:26,024
Let me continue...

124
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,193
For crying out loud, stop it!

125
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,279
So to continue my story...

126
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:35,075
- My mother and my brother's father split up.
- Hello, Ma?

127
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,242
After that...

128
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,662
my mother and my father...

129
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,955
became like this.

130
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,831
Married?

131
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,292
That can't be! She's already married.

132
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,002
Not married!

133
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,045
They're just real tight.

134
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,130
As my father's mother would say...

135
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,466
Married only in bed!

136
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,467
Maya!

137
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,931
Mother wants me to come home.

138
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:49,190
She's going out of town
to look for maids for her agency.

139
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,526
No one will be at the house.

140
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:56,614
Don't get mad.

141
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,708
Every single time my mother needs me,
you get mad.

142
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,337
I'm not angry! See?

143
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,381
That wasn't an angry face!

144
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,050
I'm actually really happy.

145
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,970
You get mad everytime she calls me.

146
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,723
That's not the point.

147
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,102
Your mother calling you doesn't make me angry.

148
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:30,565
I get angry because she's doing this to prove

149
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,776
that you're at her beck and call.

150
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,154
And I can't do anything about it
because we aren't married.

151
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,911
So...

152
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:44,996
What can you say?

153
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:48,124
I gotta go.

154
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,460
See you when I see you!

155
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,380
Well...

156
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,799
See yours when I see yours!

157
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:06,142
All the kids I know only have
one father even if they have 10 siblings!

158
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,520
Shouldn't it be that way, Mom?

159
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,271
Not always.

160
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,732
Sometimes, couples break up.

161
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:15,151
Especially if they fight all the time.

162
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:18,196
Did you and dad fight all the time?

163
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,367
The truth is...

164
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,452
Your father and I?

165
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:26,913
No!

166
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,582
Then why?

167
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,377
Because your father was offered a job in Surigao.

168
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:36,089
He was the senior technician
in a mining company.

169
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,425
I didn't go because I had a job here.

170
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:43,013
Was your job more important than my father?

171
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,689
I wanted to make something of myself, too.

172
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,442
I have my own dreams.

173
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,778
I don't get it.

174
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,197
It's easy, listen...

175
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,366
I'm your mother.

176
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,910
You love me very much.

177
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,748
But you wouldn't like it if I said to you:

178
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,625
"Ojie, you can only love me."

179
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,419
Or "Stop going to school."

180
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:18,089
Or "Ojie, you can't be with
your friends because I'd be alone."

181
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,343
Would you like that?

182
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,886
Of course not!

183
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:24,763
What about me?

184
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,682
Precisely! What about you?

185
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,352
It's the same with married people.

186
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,604
As much as they love each other...

187
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,857
they have to think of themselves, too.

188
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,155
Don't you love him anymore?

189
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,823
Fool!

190
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,409
Of course I do!

191
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,245
I love Raffy, your father.

192
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,998
I love Ding as well.

193
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,710
It's not easy to understand...

194
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,588
Because sometimes...

195
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,882
Sometimes, when...

196
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,303
It's just the way it is.

197
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,222
It's just how it is?

198
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,973
Do you understand now?

199
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:10,809
No, I still can't.

200
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,814
I was so shocked.

201
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,735
I froze in fear. I couldn't even move.

202
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,572
I could smell gasoline all over my body.

203
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,952
Then, he lit the match.

204
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,749
His eyes turned wild, like the devil himself.

205
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,835
He said to me,

206
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:41,297
"You thought, I couldn't do this?"

207
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,388
And that lit match...

208
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,932
He threw it at me!

209
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,018
My whole body went up in flames.

210
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,772
Until now, I still can't believe he did this to me.

211
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,407
I can't go with you.
There's no one with the children.

212
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:10,618
I asked my neighbor to keep an eye on them.

213
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,212
The woman called again.

214
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,382
The one who just keeps crying?

215
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,634
Yes, she's driving me crazy!

216
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,222
Are you alone?

217
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:34,517
No one lobbies in the Senate alone.

218
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,269
Everybody will be there.

219
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,023
What about Soledad Gatdula's case?

220
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,941
The migrant is now handling it.

221
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,235
They'll get the body repatriated.

222
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,740
Alright, I have to go.

223
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,241
See you when I see you!

224
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,410
Well...

225
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,013
What time did he arrive?

226
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,893
So, that means I can stay here a bit longer?

227
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,605
Your brother, is he home?

228
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,900
No, nevermind.

229
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:29,739
If I talk to your father,
he'd think I have a crush on him.

230
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,659
Alright darling, okay.

231
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:36,788
Hi.

232
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,458
Do you still remember me?

233
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,253
I'm back here in Manila.

234
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,255
How are you?

235
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,217
My brother told me you'd be here.

236
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,528
How's Ojie?

237
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,032
He's all grown up!

238
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,951
In fact, he's already circumcised.

239
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,665
I can't tell if he's a grown up or still my baby.

240
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,294
He's already courting girls
but sometimes he acts like a child.

241
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,171
You must have spoiled him.

242
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,213
A bit.

243
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:30,091
I let him have his way.

244
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,808
Can I see Ojie?

245
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,479
Why not?

246
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,856
When do you want to?

247
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,025
Tomorrow?

248
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,528
It's up to you. Where?

249
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,447
It's up to you.

250
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,199
What time?

251
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,743
It's up to you.

252
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,876
Why don't...

253
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:06,294
you find yourself...

254
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,254
a spouse as well, Raffy?

255
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,299
It's been a long time since we were together.

256
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,676
I have.

257
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,136
It's been a year.

258
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,764
She's pregnant now.

259
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,891
I'll become a father again.

260
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,897
You must be happy, huh?

261
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,566
Mom, are you sure he's Ojie's father?

262
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,984
Why, of course!

263
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:33,113
Ding...

264
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,240
It's not like we're checking in a motel!

265
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,784
We aren't doing anything wrong.

266
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,536
Is that so?

267
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,579
Mom...

268
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,582
Will you still recognize Ojie's father?

269
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,209
Of course. Your mother's still in love with him!

270
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,670
Of course I do. He's my friend!

271
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:52,298
Just your friend? Mom, he's my father!

272
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,675
He's your husband!

273
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:54,592
Fool!

274
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,053
Mom's real husband is my father!

275
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:01,641
No way, silly! My father is mom's real husband!

276
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,436
Fine, they're both my husbands!

277
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,812
Two husbands?

278
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,399
Elizabeth Taylor had seven!

279
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,317
Hey!

280
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,236
You're not Elizabeth Taylor!

281
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:16,573
Oh, this isn't going anywhere.

282
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,825
Ojie, eat your dinner. You have to be up early.

283
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,661
I'll also have dinner now. I'm going with you.

284
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,621
Right! Go with them!

285
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,374
To be the chaperone!

286
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,003
Mom! Ojie's nervous.

287
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:33,298
He doesn't know what his father's like.

288
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,509
Hey! You're the one who's nervous.

289
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,430
You've nothing to worry about.
He's only Ojie's father!

290
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:46,061
Maya's afraid, my father won't
like her tagging along.

291
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,397
Mom, does he know you have another child?

292
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,106
Yes of course!

293
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,691
You told him?

294
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:52,859
Why not?

295
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,486
See? She told him!

296
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:59,741
Maya said my father might not like her

297
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,826
because she's not his daughter.

298
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:08,708
Ojie's asking if his father loves him,
how come he hasn't visited him before?

299
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,378
Poor Raffy, you both think ill of him!

300
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,964
You haven't even met him yet
and you're already judging the man.

301
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:18,093
Why don't you get to know him first?

302
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,427
Approve?

303
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,261
Approve!

304
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,003
Hi.

305
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:55,422
This is Ojie.

306
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,133
And this is Maya.

307
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:00,468
Ojie...

308
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,929
He's your father.

309
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:11,855
Hi.

310
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:57,233
How are you, really?

311
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,861
Are you happy?

312
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:02,489
Sometimes.

313
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,492
Sometimes? Why not always?

314
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,079
It's fine to be sad once in a while.

315
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,289
We should also feel sad sometimes.

316
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,958
So when you're happy, it's more meaningful.

317
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,169
In that sense, you are truly happy.

318
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:22,425
Did you come back
because you got tired of Surigao?

319
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,636
It's hard for Elinor.

320
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,972
What about your work?

321
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,642
When the baby comes, we'll go to America.

322
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:34,437
Really?

323
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,856
Yeah. New York.

324
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,238
You've always said you hated living in the city.

325
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,281
That you prefer living in a quiet town.

326
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,991
What will you do in New York?

327
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:47,992
No! Wait.

328
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:52,580
What I said was,
I wanted to experience different places.

329
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,042
Oh...

330
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,634
I'm sorry...

331
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,721
That things turned out this way for us.

332
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:09,180
Don't talk like that!

333
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:12,726
There's nothing wrong with our lives.
There's nothing to apologize for.

334
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:16,771
She shivered in fright.

335
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:20,066
The police were after us.

336
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:24,612
The women ran with their children.

337
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,949
My child couldn't move.

338
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,784
She shivered in fright.

339
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:30,660
Then -

340
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,537
- My father doesn't shout!
- He does too!

341
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,748
It's my father who doesn't shout!

342
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:35,749
What's going on!

343
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,543
How can you say your father doesn't shout?

344
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,128
You don't even know him.

345
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,755
I hate you! You're not my brother!

346
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,299
You love your father more than mine.

347
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:46,176
Of course, he's my father!
There's nothing you can do about it.

348
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,302
He's my father!

349
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:48,803
What's happening here?

350
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,889
Tell your children to shut up!

351
00:23:51,348 --> 00:23:52,515
What's the problem?

352
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:56,811
He said you love his father more than mine.

353
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:59,147
Of course, he's her husband!

354
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,231
You're so pesky!

355
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,399
Wait, wait!

356
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,817
Hold on a minute!

357
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,613
I love them both, okay?

358
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,782
You can't love them both!

359
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:11,242
But, I do and I can't change that!

360
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,913
Besides, with love...

361
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:18,458
You don't divide love, you multiply it.

362
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,003
Maya, please, stop it!

363
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,463
Don't shout at the children!

364
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:25,048
Don't shout at my mom!

365
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,258
That's why she loves his dad more.

366
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,011
You should have seen them embrace.

367
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:31,763
They even kissed!

368
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:32,847
See? I told you!

369
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,142
That's right!
They were really sweet like newlyweds.

370
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,687
You're such a turncoat!

371
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:41,940
Do you even know what newlyweds look like?

372
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,609
Don't change the topic.

373
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,611
Did you kiss him?

374
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:48,613
You should know Maya...

375
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:53,076
Friends kiss each other, especially if they
haven't seen each other for a long time.

376
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:55,453
You just saw each other yesterday!

377
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:57,247
She's right!

378
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,167
We were still uncomfortable with each other then!

379
00:25:01,209 --> 00:25:03,253
It's only today that we got to...

380
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,170
Do what?

381
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,588
Confess your love for each other?

382
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,631
Oh, please!

383
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:08,425
Not in front of the kids...

384
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:09,050
So what?

385
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:10,301
I thought there's nothing wrong with the truth?

386
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,262
We didn't do anything wrong. So stop accusing me!

387
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:13,638
You mean to say my daughter's a liar?

388
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,889
I never said that!

389
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:16,975
All I said was that's not the truth!

390
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:19,060
Ojie, are they fighting now?

391
00:25:54,846 --> 00:25:56,139
We're okay now right?

392
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:08,253
Put something on.

393
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,462
You'll catch a cold again.

394
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:48,543
Hello?

395
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:52,881
Hi. Raffy!

396
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:56,551
Thank you.

397
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:01,139
Why didn't you bring your daughter?

398
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:02,307
That won't be a good idea.

399
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,434
She might ask to stay here.

400
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:07,270
I wonder what's taking Raffy so long.

401
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,981
I could have done the grocery myself.

402
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,691
Let him do it!

403
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:14,611
He's used to doing it anyway.

404
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,446
Really now?

405
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:18,990
He claims he just started learning.

406
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:24,454
My goodness, Raffy.

407
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:28,750
It always takes him forever
but all he ever buys are canned goods.

408
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:31,628
When we were together,
all we had were canned goods.

409
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,213
I didn't like to cook.

410
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:35,799
Really?

411
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,637
Didn't he tell you about it?

412
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:46,559
It's just, we never really got to talk about you.

413
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,982
I'll wait for Dad outside, Mom.

414
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:53,942
Sure.

415
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:54,818
I'll go out now.

416
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:03,326
This is hard for my son.

417
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:07,831
It'll be the first time he'll be away from home.

418
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:10,834
But this is his father's house.

419
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:14,045
That's what I mean.

420
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,258
It's his father's house...

421
00:29:19,384 --> 00:29:21,261
but it's not his home.

422
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:25,348
The truth is...

423
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:31,271
Even his own father isn't quite his father.

424
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:37,819
My son's afraid you might not like him.

425
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:43,158
He might do something you won't like.

426
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,203
And if that were so,

427
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:50,498
he might...

428
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,587
He might lose the chance
to become close to his father.

429
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:00,717
Is that why you chose to bring him over,

430
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,428
instead of meeting Raffy somewhere else?

431
00:30:04,262 --> 00:30:06,556
To see me personally?

432
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:11,227
To see whether I'm the type who beats children?

433
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:16,274
I'm his mother.

434
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:21,404
Mom, Dad's here!

435
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,114
- Hi!
- Hi!

436
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:25,533
- Hi!
- Sorry. It was so crowded at the supermarket.

437
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,702
Here, I bought a lot of stuff.

438
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,079
Where's Maya?

439
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,789
She's with her dad.

440
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:32,624
You should have brought her along.

441
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,000
Come on, let's eat.

442
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,168
No, don't bother!

443
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,545
I'm afraid I can't stay longer. I have to go to the office.

444
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:38,213
Bye!

445
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,174
Call me anytime you want.

446
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:41,758
Yes, Mom.

447
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,300
Elinor?

448
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,470
Don't worry about Ojie. He'll be fine here.

449
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,515
I'll see you to the door.

450
00:30:48,556 --> 00:30:49,849
Take care, Mom.

451
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,686
Another one of our migrant workers

452
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:56,648
was raped and killed abroad.

453
00:30:57,065 --> 00:31:00,110
What is the government doing about it?

454
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:04,572
Do they even know what's going on?

455
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:07,659
Mr. Ramos!

456
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,828
You may not be aware of it

457
00:31:10,995 --> 00:31:12,664
but in Singapore

458
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:15,250
migrant domestic workers

459
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,585
are subjected to mandatory pregnancy tests.

460
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:21,297
There's also a process for abused women.

461
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,134
So they they can also be helped...

462
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,930
Do you realize Johnny...

463
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:33,268
Some men treat their penis like a gun?

464
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,729
No, really!

465
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:39,315
Because when they are mad at women...

466
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:42,193
they use their penis to threaten and intimidate.

467
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:43,862
Aren't I right?

468
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:47,282
Have you seen...

469
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:50,702
Did you watch the film, Full Metal Jacket?

470
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:52,454
There's a scene there where

471
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,790
there are soldiers marching.

472
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:57,667
And their chant goes like this:

473
00:31:58,043 --> 00:31:59,711
This is my weapon.

474
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,338
This is my gun.

475
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:03,006
This is for business.

476
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:04,758
This is for fun!

477
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:09,095
You mean, they hold their thing...

478
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,180
Like this?

479
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:15,352
You know what?

480
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:17,228
I know this guy.

481
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,898
It's not a gun he likens his penis to.

482
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,149
Gold!

483
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:22,359
Who?

484
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,402
My ex-husband.

485
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:26,279
Back then...

486
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:28,907
Everytime he was mad at me,

487
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:30,784
he'd refuse to have sex with me.

488
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,745
He thinks his penis is a priceless commodity!

489
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,413
You're being emotional.

490
00:32:35,705 --> 00:32:38,083
To think you've been separated for years now.

491
00:32:42,837 --> 00:32:45,131
You must still be in love with him.

492
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:46,549
Of course not!

493
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,259
Then why are you still thinking about him?

494
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,974
That gold was precious.

495
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,112
Lea.

496
00:33:07,153 --> 00:33:10,073
Sister, this is my daughter.

497
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:12,242
This is Maya? She's so pretty!

498
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:14,285
- How are you?
- Fine, sister.

499
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:16,287
And smart, too!

500
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:19,874
That woman who kept
calling us and crying is here.

501
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:23,086
Goodness! She's the wife of Sigmund Olivares.

502
00:33:23,128 --> 00:33:25,130
Does his name ring a bell?

503
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:26,548
Sportsman?

504
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:27,465
Correct!

505
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:31,469
Sportsman, promoter, banker
and I don't know what else.

506
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:34,264
If you saw her, your heart will break.

507
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:36,558
She's severely battered and almost hysterical.

508
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:39,519
Now all she wants is never
to see the husband again.

509
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:42,939
I don't ever wanna see your face again.
You understand?

510
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,567
I'm leaving you for good Sigmund!

511
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:49,738
I'm here at the Women Crisis
and Survival Center now.

512
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:52,282
What is the address of this center?

513
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:55,410
I'm telling this bastard that
I don't want to ever go back to him.

514
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:58,621
Well not unless of course you still
wanna make a go of this marriage.

515
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:00,665
Stop it! You're going to fall.

516
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:03,668
Stop being so stubborn!

517
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:06,087
Stop it!

518
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:09,299
Maya, here it is! Give me just a minute!

519
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:10,050
I don't want to!

520
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:11,009
I don't want to!

521
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,428
She's exhausted from tagging
along with you all day.

522
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,472
I don't understand why you
had to leave Ojie there!

523
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,307
You don't even care to know
what's happening to him!

524
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:19,642
Maya, stop it already.
You're giving me a headache!

525
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:20,602
I don't want to!

526
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:24,439
Do you know what time it is? It's 9PM!

527
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:28,276
The kid hasn't had dinner!
She should've eaten at 7!

528
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:30,987
Will you never stop?
I'm losing my patience here!

529
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:32,614
- Stop it!
- I don't want to!

530
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:34,199
Here! I'll make dinner.

531
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,284
You should have told me you'll be late!

532
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:38,661
I could have prepared something!

533
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:40,497
Then, she wouldn't be starving now!

534
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:43,416
Really, Maya you don't plan to stop?!

535
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:45,543
I'm really going to cover your mouth now!

536
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:48,546
I'll cook some eggs. How do you want them done?

537
00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:51,758
You make so much noise! You can be a siren!

538
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,679
Did you hear me, Lea?!
What do I do with the eggs?!

539
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,223
Well damn it! Make them hatch!

540
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:23,456
How are you, Ojie?

541
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:25,583
What?

542
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:27,043
How are you?

543
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:31,047
Does your Uncle Ding treat you well?

544
00:35:31,548 --> 00:35:32,674
Yeah.

545
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,595
Like you're his own son?

546
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:43,435
Yeah... sure.

547
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:45,353
You sound unconvinced...

548
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:46,771
No!

549
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:49,232
I mean... yes!

550
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:51,401
But...

551
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:55,071
But sometimes it's hard.

552
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:58,074
What do you mean?

553
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:02,746
Knowing that I'm not really his son.

554
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:03,830
Why?

555
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:06,082
You mean, there's a gap between you two?

556
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:08,043
You can't talk to him?

557
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,420
When it's just us.

558
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,424
When we're with other people,
I keep my distance.

559
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:15,967
Especially before.

560
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:17,552
Why?

561
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:19,471
Well...

562
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:22,098
Maybe because...

563
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:26,519
People might think that I'm his son.

564
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:30,523
What's wrong with that?

565
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:32,150
Once...

566
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:35,612
but this was a long time ago...

567
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:39,783
Someone asked him how I was related to Mom.

568
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:42,869
And he said, I was her nephew.

569
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:47,457
But I'm not angry, Dad.

570
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,876
Ding is nice to me.

571
00:36:49,918 --> 00:36:52,504
He doesn't even scold me.

572
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:57,801
And I love Maya very much.

573
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:02,639
Even if she's only my half sister,

574
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:06,267
I won't exchange her for anything.

575
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,064
The smoke is making my eyes sting.

576
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:24,577
What is it?

577
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:30,750
Is there anything wrong?

578
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:35,380
Can we talk?

579
00:37:37,882 --> 00:37:39,175
About my son?

580
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:47,851
What did you say?

581
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,312
You heard me, Lei.

582
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:57,527
I'm asking you if you'd consider
giving me the custody of Ojie.

583
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:00,739
We'll take him with us to America.

584
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,618
We won't be leaving until the baby comes though.

585
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:09,998
So you have an entire year to think about it.

586
00:38:36,691 --> 00:38:40,236
Really now. It's nothing!

587
00:38:42,155 --> 00:38:46,159
Of course I'm not angry!
He's your son as much as he is mine!

588
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:48,703
Don't worry about it.

589
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:51,414
I don't mind at all.

590
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,086
Besides, it's his decision anyway.

591
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,756
Do you want to tell him yourself?
Or do you want me to do it?

592
00:39:00,715 --> 00:39:01,633
Ok...

593
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,051
No problem.

594
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:04,719
I'll do it for you.

595
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,012
Okay, see you around!

596
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:07,597
Bye!

597
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:31,996
It's nice to have your mother by your side.

598
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:34,791
She'll always be there
for you when things go wrong.

599
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:38,712
She'll be there to kiss your pains away.

600
00:39:41,506 --> 00:39:43,383
On the other hand...

601
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:47,721
There are some things
that are better to ask a father.

602
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:54,561
Things that a father better understands.

603
00:39:58,106 --> 00:39:58,898
You know what...

604
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:06,614
You'll go through feelings and experiences
that only a father can help you go through.

605
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:08,116
Ugly!

606
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,288
Ugly!

607
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,840
We're not asking you to choose between us, Ojie.

608
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,845
We're giving you the right
to make your own decision.

609
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:33,641
So, think about your answer well.

610
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:39,939
What's happening?

611
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:44,861
I don't understand you!

612
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:48,365
You've been crying for a month!

613
00:40:56,664 --> 00:40:58,875
What's wrong!?

614
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,216
The teacher is right, Mrs. Gascon.

615
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:11,054
Your children should have the same family name
if you want to pay the PTA fee once.

616
00:41:11,096 --> 00:41:13,306
What if they have different fathers?

617
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,058
Why?

618
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:17,977
Is your first husband dead?

619
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,771
No.

620
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,899
To whom are you married?

621
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,237
To no one.

622
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:29,948
Well how do I call you now?

623
00:41:31,032 --> 00:41:32,325
Call me Lea.

624
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:35,161
That's what my children's fathers call me.

625
00:41:35,203 --> 00:41:36,413
Mrs. De Lara...

626
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:38,039
Will you make up your mind?

627
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:40,667
What do you really want to call me?

628
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:45,422
Well I suggest that you transfer one
of your children to another school.

629
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:47,799
Why Ms. Bustamante?

630
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:50,093
So we can avoid a scandal!

631
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,429
That would be good for you and for your children.

632
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,348
Don't you go telling me
what's good for my children!

633
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,976
- Look Ms.-
- There's nothing wrong with my children!

634
00:41:58,018 --> 00:41:59,561
Maybe there's something wrong with you!

635
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:02,063
- Listen to me-
- No you listen to me!

636
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:04,065
You want to expel one of my children?

637
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,567
Go ahead! Do it!

638
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:10,113
But know that DECS
and the courts will hear about it!

639
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:13,908
I will not allow you to discriminate
my children, Mrs. Zalamea.

640
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,119
And you'd better believe that.

641
00:42:40,352 --> 00:42:41,478
Bye, Mom!

642
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:51,154
Dad!

643
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,365
What took you so long?

644
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:55,992
This is hard for me as well.

645
00:42:57,827 --> 00:43:00,080
Everytime Raffy takes Ojie...

646
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:02,582
I feel sorry for my daughter.

647
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:04,376
She misses her brother.

648
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:07,295
Why not tell Raffy not to take Ojie so often?

649
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:10,423
How can I deny my son
the chance to be with his father?

650
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:16,388
It scares me sometimes, though.

651
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:19,557
Everytime Raffy takes Ojie...

652
00:43:21,142 --> 00:43:23,853
I feel like I'm slowly losing my son.

653
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:28,233
Wow, we're talking serious, man!

654
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:34,906
I bet the next thing that'll come out
of your mouth will be pure rubbish!

655
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:11,484
Hello!

656
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:13,778
Johnny, you awake?

657
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,822
No, no... It's not an emergency.

658
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:18,742
It's about my son's school project...

659
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:22,495
A radio?

660
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:25,790
You called me up in the dead
of the night to ask about a radio?

661
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:28,668
You could have just bought one!
Why do you have to make one?

662
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:30,295
I said I'm sorry!

663
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:33,965
It's for my son's project!
What can I do if the project requires -

664
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:41,848
I'm back...

665
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,435
This time it's for real.

666
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:56,529
It gets more and more violent!

667
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:03,370
All because of these evaluations!

668
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:09,000
He's got all these creditors running after him.

669
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:18,218
I don't want to go back to him, ever!

670
00:45:18,843 --> 00:45:20,053
I don't want to go back.

671
00:45:20,762 --> 00:45:23,223
I don't ever want to go back

672
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,350
Ever!

673
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:26,351
Sister...

674
00:45:26,976 --> 00:45:29,187
It's possible my mother may change her mind.

675
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,815
But not me.

676
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:37,654
I want out of this family!

677
00:45:46,788 --> 00:45:47,580
For you...

678
00:45:47,622 --> 00:45:48,790
Call Ojie.

679
00:45:48,832 --> 00:45:50,250
Tell him I'm home.

680
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:52,002
He's not here.

681
00:45:52,585 --> 00:45:53,795
What?

682
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:57,382
Mom...

683
00:45:57,632 --> 00:46:00,385
I think I have to tell you this...

684
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:02,429
Ojie has been going out every night.

685
00:46:02,470 --> 00:46:06,474
He has been skipping school
and he's always playing billiards.

686
00:46:08,727 --> 00:46:12,939
What time it is? I'm running
out of luck and I'm hungry!

687
00:46:14,357 --> 00:46:15,567
Who's turn is it?

688
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:18,653
Is it my turn? Alright! I'll finish this!

689
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:27,203
Do you know what gambling does to people's lives?

690
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:29,789
Once you get hooked, there's no turning back!

691
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:32,000
It'll ruin your life!

692
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,960
You'll destroy your life!

693
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:35,295
You don't have to shout at him!

694
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:37,172
I'm not talking to you!

695
00:46:37,213 --> 00:46:39,966
But you always do what you want.

696
00:46:40,425 --> 00:46:42,218
Why can't we?

697
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:47,766
I'm not doing anything wrong!

698
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,768
That's what you think!

699
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:51,936
But, you're wrong! You're wrong!

700
00:47:04,866 --> 00:47:05,367
Ojie...

701
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,534
Ojie! Ojie!

702
00:47:06,576 --> 00:47:06,951
Ojie!

703
00:47:08,244 --> 00:47:09,037
Ojie...

704
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:10,246
Ojie! Ojie!

705
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:12,832
Ojie...

706
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:14,501
Ojie...

707
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:17,295
Ojie...

708
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:19,255
Ojie!

709
00:47:30,558 --> 00:47:32,727
I'm sorry to bother you, Uncle Johnny.

710
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:35,105
It's okay.

711
00:47:36,106 --> 00:47:42,987
I can't call my father because
Grandma will take it against Mom.

712
00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:44,906
Because you see,

713
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:49,953
Ojie wasn't able to attend this Boy Scout thing...

714
00:47:49,994 --> 00:47:52,122
because he had to bring a father along.

715
00:47:52,163 --> 00:47:54,624
He tried to call his dad...

716
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,584
but he was away and didn't return his call.

717
00:47:56,626 --> 00:48:00,380
He didn't want to ask my Dad
because he's not his father anyway.

718
00:48:00,422 --> 00:48:04,426
So, he told his teacher that
he didn't want to join the Boy Scouts...

719
00:48:04,509 --> 00:48:07,095
but that's not true because it's his dream.

720
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,987
You should have told me
about this Boy Scout ceremony.

721
00:48:28,408 --> 00:48:30,827
Even if you're father isn't here...

722
00:48:30,869 --> 00:48:32,662
I am.

723
00:48:39,252 --> 00:48:42,839
I could have tied the Boy Scout
kerchief around your neck...

724
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:48,470
I can be a father too.

725
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:57,437
But please...

726
00:48:59,522 --> 00:49:04,277
don't blame me for your father's shortcomings.

727
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:13,578
Don't take out on me things
I can't do anything about.

728
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:26,549
Mom...

729
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:36,351
Mom, I'm sorry.

730
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:00,375
I'm sorry too, son.

731
00:50:14,472 --> 00:50:16,307
Hey! Close your eyes.

732
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:17,809
Don't peep!

733
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:19,477
I don't like cheating.

734
00:50:24,858 --> 00:50:26,401
Hold on...

735
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:29,154
Okay...

736
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:31,114
Open your eyes!

737
00:50:32,365 --> 00:50:33,324
Wow!

738
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:34,617
Is this ours, Mom?

739
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:35,660
It's all yours.

740
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:38,413
Just be careful. Be very very careful.

741
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:39,497
We'll try it out now!

742
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:40,749
Go ahead. Be careful though!

743
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:41,875
Let's play, Ojie!

744
00:50:43,209 --> 00:50:45,670
I said be careful! Stay close!

745
00:50:46,212 --> 00:50:48,256
So now, you say 'be careful'!

746
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:50,800
But you buy them a bike, knowing it's dangerous.

747
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:53,261
That's nothing but trouble!

748
00:50:58,308 --> 00:50:59,059
Hey!

749
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:01,436
Not too fast!

750
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,523
Wow, you both got good grades.

751
00:51:05,899 --> 00:51:10,904
Wow, Ojie! It's just the
1st quarter but look! An 80 and 85!

752
00:51:10,945 --> 00:51:13,114
- Good!
- Mom, you must be mistaken.

753
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:15,909
Those must be my grades.

754
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:16,785
Yikes!

755
00:51:17,577 --> 00:51:19,496
I became a De Lara!

756
00:51:19,537 --> 00:51:21,581
Mom, mine's Gascon!

757
00:51:23,041 --> 00:51:24,042
Yikes!

758
00:51:26,753 --> 00:51:31,716
The different surnames of my children
must be quite confusing for you.

759
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:35,679
Well at this point...

760
00:51:36,096 --> 00:51:38,181
I have already accepted your situation.

761
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:40,892
There.

762
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:42,644
One for each teacher.

763
00:51:43,186 --> 00:51:44,312
Thank you.

764
00:51:44,813 --> 00:51:47,190
You have to pay for those cards.

765
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:51,945
No not to me, to the cashier.

766
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:56,741
Ms. Bustamante,

767
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:59,744
you're going to meet
the teachers of your children.

768
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:02,080
Since you seem to have extra money,

769
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:04,457
you might want to make
a contribution for the dead.

770
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,796
There's nothing funny about a gruesome death, Ms. Bustamante.

771
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:19,556
He's the father of your daughter's classmate.

772
00:52:19,597 --> 00:52:21,766
Their house was set on fire.

773
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:29,107
You didn't know that a fire
broke out near here last Saturday ?

774
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:30,984
Fire?

775
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:32,736
Yes, fire!

776
00:52:32,777 --> 00:52:34,320
As in 'fire'.

777
00:52:34,362 --> 00:52:36,239
The squatters' area was burned down.

778
00:52:36,322 --> 00:52:39,617
Of course, no one will claim responsibility for it.

779
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:45,665
But if you know your history,
this has been going on for quite some time.

780
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:48,960
Especially when the government
wants to drive them away.

781
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:55,884
Soliman, the one who died, thought
one of his children was left inside.

782
00:52:55,925 --> 00:52:58,053
He braved the fire and went back in.

783
00:52:58,094 --> 00:53:00,096
But the fire already spread.

784
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:01,890
He couldn't get out anymore.

785
00:53:02,682 --> 00:53:05,935
Now, Ms. Bustamante, tell me if that's funny.

786
00:53:07,395 --> 00:53:08,605
I'm sorry.

787
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:10,565
You should be.

788
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:15,737
I wonder, why wasn't it featured in the papers?

789
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,740
Why?

790
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:22,702
Since when were poor people
like Soliman given importance?

791
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:32,420
Can you help me get some details like...

792
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:34,964
the number of families affected,

793
00:53:35,048 --> 00:53:36,800
where have they been relocated,

794
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:38,718
and whether the government is doing anything.

795
00:53:39,135 --> 00:53:40,637
What for?

796
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:43,223
To call the attention of the authorities...

797
00:53:43,848 --> 00:53:45,433
The NGOs...

798
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:47,602
The proper government agencies.

799
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:49,229
Why?

800
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:51,106
Do you have any connections?

801
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:56,111
I work for a non-government agency.

802
00:53:57,696 --> 00:54:00,448
Women in Crisis Center to be exact.

803
00:54:03,493 --> 00:54:05,036
I never realized...

804
00:54:05,078 --> 00:54:06,246
I know you don't.

805
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,124
I always thought that...

806
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:11,418
That, well...

807
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:13,837
That you were, you know...

808
00:54:14,587 --> 00:54:16,047
A hospitality girl.

809
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:18,091
I can believe that.

810
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:27,851
When you say Women in Crisis Center,
do you mean victims of rape and domestic violence?

811
00:54:27,892 --> 00:54:30,145
In particular, yes.

812
00:54:31,229 --> 00:54:37,235
Everything that concerns women,
but in general anything that concerns human rights.

813
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:41,489
Well everything that concerns
human rights concerns women.

814
00:54:41,531 --> 00:54:43,408
Of course.

815
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:49,289
Do you believe that violations on
human rights are still rampant in our country?

816
00:54:49,539 --> 00:54:51,750
Of course, don't you?

817
00:54:51,791 --> 00:54:54,294
I do! If I didn't,

818
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:57,505
I would not be concerned
for the welfare of the squatters.

819
00:54:57,756 --> 00:54:59,174
In fact...

820
00:55:01,217 --> 00:55:06,348
I have always been
a staunch supporter of militant groups.

821
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:07,807
Really?

822
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:10,935
Of course,
I don't join rallies since I'm a principal.

823
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:13,188
I have to keep a low profile.

824
00:55:13,229 --> 00:55:15,106
But when my teachers went on strike...

825
00:55:15,148 --> 00:55:20,862
I think I was the only principal
who refused to submit their names.

826
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:22,530
I see.

827
00:55:24,115 --> 00:55:29,579
They weren't fired because
DECS never got their names.

828
00:55:30,372 --> 00:55:33,291
And I am so proud of what I did.

829
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,126
You should be.

830
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:40,382
Well, it was nice meeting you Ms. Bustamante.

831
00:55:40,423 --> 00:55:41,841
Call me Lea.

832
00:55:41,925 --> 00:55:43,093
Whatever.

833
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:45,845
A rose, by any other name...

834
00:55:48,473 --> 00:55:50,433
How does that saying go again?

835
00:55:50,767 --> 00:55:55,980
Well Mr. Olivares, your wife may be willing
to go back to you, but not your daughter.

836
00:55:56,439 --> 00:56:01,486
She already signed a statement with us saying that
she left your house over her own free will.

837
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:07,117
And we also use that to get a court order,
barring you from getting anywhere near her.

838
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:09,119
It's all my fault...

839
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,412
Yes!

840
00:56:12,038 --> 00:56:14,040
She's now in our custody.

841
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:17,544
If you want to get her back,
you would have to fight us in court.

842
00:56:18,253 --> 00:56:20,296
Thank you very much, Attorney.

843
00:56:20,505 --> 00:56:23,258
Mrs. Cruz, thank you so much.

844
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:24,801
Thank you!

845
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:26,678
- I'll see them to their car.
- Alright, Johnny.

846
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,305
- Thank you again, Attorney.
- Okay!

847
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:37,230
Sister...

848
00:56:37,605 --> 00:56:40,442
We have a fax from Baguio about the conference.

849
00:56:40,483 --> 00:56:42,652
Oh, I almost forgot! Lea!

850
00:56:43,028 --> 00:56:44,362
Lea, wait!

851
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:45,905
Do you think you can go?

852
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:46,781
Where?

853
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:50,368
A conference in Baguio. It'll only be for a day.
You and Johnny.

854
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,914
You'll like this. It's a natural color.

855
00:56:55,206 --> 00:56:59,210
Okay. After that, give me a facial
and remove all my white heads.

856
00:56:59,252 --> 00:57:01,463
Everytime you come here, you get the whole deal!

857
00:57:01,504 --> 00:57:03,214
If I know, you have a date!

858
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:05,550
Is he your boyfriend yet?

859
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:06,885
Still a prospect. Ouch!

860
00:57:06,926 --> 00:57:08,386
Maya...

861
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:11,598
Call your Grandma again.
Ask if your father's there.

862
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:14,726
Then tell your father to come home.
Right away, okay?

863
00:57:14,768 --> 00:57:16,353
I have a date.

864
00:57:16,811 --> 00:57:18,980
- How do I look?
- Great!

865
00:57:19,522 --> 00:57:22,025
Medy, use the Greek Red okay?

866
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:35,080
Mom...

867
00:57:35,622 --> 00:57:39,250
You want me to try grandma's house again?

868
00:57:39,793 --> 00:57:43,296
You know Maya, by now, she's already on to you.

869
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:47,092
I bet she suspects that
you're calling your Dad for Mom.

870
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:50,011
The more she won't give him the phone.

871
00:57:52,806 --> 00:57:54,766
What now, Mom?

872
00:57:55,266 --> 00:57:57,560
Do you have a plan B?

873
00:58:00,897 --> 00:58:02,649
You're okay right?

874
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:04,943
Behave yourselves. Don't fight, okay?

875
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:09,531
Maya, watch your mouth, don't talk a lot okay?

876
00:58:11,324 --> 00:58:14,703
Sleep early tonight, I'll fetch you tomorrow.

877
00:58:14,744 --> 00:58:17,205
But where are you taking us?

878
00:58:17,997 --> 00:58:19,499
Leave it to me.

879
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:23,253
Mister, turn right over there.

880
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,640
Please, Elinor? It's an emergency.

881
00:58:35,682 --> 00:58:39,144
If I don't make it,
my job is at stake. I'll get fired.

882
00:58:41,146 --> 00:58:42,647
Okay... It's fine.

883
00:58:43,189 --> 00:58:46,151
Ojie, Maya, get down. Hurry!

884
00:58:46,192 --> 00:58:47,318
Your bags!

885
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:48,862
Hurry!

886
00:58:48,903 --> 00:58:50,321
Go, kiss your Auntie Elinor.

887
00:58:51,322 --> 00:58:52,866
- Hi, Auntie!
- Ojie, kiss your auntie!

888
00:58:52,907 --> 00:58:54,075
Ojie...

889
00:58:54,117 --> 00:58:57,328
Your father will be back shortly, Ojie.

890
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,830
Lea, come in!

891
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:00,331
Sorry, the cab's waiting.

892
00:59:00,373 --> 00:59:03,001
I'm so sorry about this.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

893
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:04,336
It's alright.

894
00:59:04,377 --> 00:59:06,588
Thank you! And give Raffy my thanks.

895
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:07,339
Sure.

896
00:59:07,922 --> 00:59:09,090
Bye now.

897
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:10,216
Behave yourselves, okay?

898
00:59:10,258 --> 00:59:11,551
- Yes, Mom.
- Bye!

899
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:13,053
Mom?

900
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:15,305
Approve!

901
00:59:35,283 --> 00:59:37,494
Sorry, I'm late! Let's go!

902
00:59:37,535 --> 00:59:39,037
I'm not going.

903
00:59:39,537 --> 00:59:41,498
I told...

904
00:59:41,539 --> 00:59:43,375
Sister Ann to go instead.

905
00:59:43,416 --> 00:59:44,959
I'll stay here in the office.

906
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:48,213
Oh! Lea you're here! Let's go!

907
00:59:48,546 --> 00:59:51,007
Let's go! Let's go! They're waiting for us.

908
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:01,643
One more please. Have a sandwich, Lea.

909
01:00:01,726 --> 01:00:03,937
No thanks. I lost my appetite.

910
01:00:06,022 --> 01:00:07,232
My goodness!

911
01:00:07,273 --> 01:00:13,363
Lea here has been grumpy
ever since we left Manila!

912
01:00:13,738 --> 01:00:15,990
Right! Maybe she's in love!

913
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:20,995
I thought I would be able to,
you know, but turns out I won't!

914
01:00:45,186 --> 01:00:48,189
Sister, can we talk?

915
01:00:48,857 --> 01:00:50,066
What is it?

916
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:53,069
I have a question.

917
01:00:54,362 --> 01:00:58,283
I'm curious. Don't you ever think about love?

918
01:00:59,075 --> 01:01:00,285
What?

919
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:02,162
Love!

920
01:01:02,203 --> 01:01:04,205
As in 'love'!

921
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:08,418
I'm not talking about love for God
or for your neighbors.

922
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:10,462
I'm talking about romantic love...

923
01:01:10,503 --> 01:01:14,799
The love of a man for a woman
or a woman for a man.

924
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:18,053
The one that comes with sex and lust.

925
01:01:18,094 --> 01:01:19,721
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

926
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:23,016
You see, even if you're a nun,
you're still a human being.

927
01:01:23,391 --> 01:01:26,311
Priests are also human beings.

928
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:30,815
Look at Father Ignacio.

929
01:01:31,232 --> 01:01:32,776
Doesn't he have a mistress?

930
01:01:32,817 --> 01:01:34,527
Really now, Lea!

931
01:01:34,569 --> 01:01:36,196
You're being crazy!

932
01:01:36,237 --> 01:01:37,614
You're cursing, Sister!

933
01:01:37,655 --> 01:01:40,283
You're even making me sin!

934
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:44,245
Why make things that are
natural to humans immoral?

935
01:01:45,121 --> 01:01:47,540
It's only natural to be sad.

936
01:01:47,582 --> 01:01:50,168
It's natural to want a man.

937
01:01:51,878 --> 01:01:55,465
When I'm sad, I become more
conscious of the men around me.

938
01:01:55,965 --> 01:02:00,261
The only man I don't even
bother considering is my father.

939
01:02:02,055 --> 01:02:04,516
Jesus, Mary, Joseph! What's with you?

940
01:02:04,641 --> 01:02:07,394
Watch some porn and you'll see what I mean.

941
01:02:07,435 --> 01:02:11,064
Just don't let feminism get in the way.

942
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:13,733
My goodness! It's like heaven on earth, Sister!

943
01:02:13,775 --> 01:02:16,569
Stop it! What's your problem?

944
01:02:16,611 --> 01:02:19,447
I don't have a problem! I'm merely stating facts.

945
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:26,079
I'm just saying that if you watch porn,
even Father Peter will look attractive to you.

946
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:29,332
Who's Father Peter?

947
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,918
I don't know a Father Peter.

948
01:02:32,002 --> 01:02:32,919
You do!

949
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:34,713
Father Peter Meter!

950
01:02:43,346 --> 01:02:44,514
Do we all fit in the picture?

951
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:46,266
I set it already, just take the picture.

952
01:02:46,307 --> 01:02:47,726
Take your places!

953
01:02:55,275 --> 01:02:56,443
One more! One more!

954
01:02:56,484 --> 01:02:57,318
One more!

955
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,071
Thank you!

956
01:03:00,655 --> 01:03:01,906
What do we do next?

957
01:03:01,948 --> 01:03:02,949
Let's shop!

958
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:04,325
We're going to buy a broom.

959
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,578
Let's visit the Grotto first.

960
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:08,538
The Grotto again?

961
01:03:10,957 --> 01:03:14,044
After the Grotto, then we buy your broom...

962
01:03:39,778 --> 01:03:41,488
Mister, my broom...

963
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:46,076
Thank you!

964
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:49,621
Ding!

965
01:03:49,662 --> 01:03:50,497
Damn it!

966
01:03:50,538 --> 01:03:51,539
What took you so long?

967
01:03:51,581 --> 01:03:52,290
Where have you been?

968
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:53,333
- But you-
- What were you thinking?

969
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:54,668
You even dragged my child into this?!

970
01:03:54,709 --> 01:03:56,086
Your husband has been calling!

971
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:58,672
His wife already gave birth!

972
01:04:03,385 --> 01:04:04,469
Hi!

973
01:04:08,807 --> 01:04:10,350
Is it a boy or a girl?

974
01:04:11,935 --> 01:04:13,645
Let's go outside.

975
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:17,899
Who gave you the right to leave
your children with my wife?

976
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:19,651
You knew she was pregnant right?

977
01:04:19,693 --> 01:04:21,611
You knew that right?!

978
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:22,987
Damn it!

979
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:24,030
Look at me!

980
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:28,326
I've been worrying about a pregnant wife
and I still had to tend to two children!

981
01:04:28,368 --> 01:04:31,663
You didn't even care to think
that she could give birth anytime!

982
01:04:31,913 --> 01:04:35,959
You should quit your job
so you can look after your children!

983
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:44,092
Do you understand what you're saying?

984
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:45,385
I'll support my son!

985
01:04:45,427 --> 01:04:46,428
Then do it!

986
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:48,596
It's your responsibility anyway!

987
01:04:48,638 --> 01:04:54,978
But even then, you have no right
to tell me what to do!

988
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:59,315
I didn't leave my job for you then,
what makes you think I'll do it now?

989
01:04:59,357 --> 01:05:00,775
That's why I'm talking to you now!

990
01:05:00,817 --> 01:05:02,027
I'm through with this conversation!

991
01:05:02,068 --> 01:05:03,319
I don't want to talk about this anymore!

992
01:05:03,778 --> 01:05:05,572
We're done talking.

993
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:15,582
Mom, was it cold in Baguio?

994
01:05:15,623 --> 01:05:17,584
When are you taking us there?

995
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:18,918
We'll plan it.

996
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,253
Look, I brought you these...

997
01:05:22,881 --> 01:05:24,215
- That's mine!
- Wait! This is better!

998
01:05:24,257 --> 01:05:26,176
Wait, don't fight! Here's a doll for you.

999
01:05:26,217 --> 01:05:27,719
Wow, a doll!

1000
01:05:28,053 --> 01:05:29,262
We have peanut brittle!

1001
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:30,889
- I want some!
- Just eat it tomorrow!

1002
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:32,849
There are strawberries as well.

1003
01:05:33,475 --> 01:05:35,352
This food is delicious as well!

1004
01:05:35,393 --> 01:05:38,688
Mom, you should have brought
something for Ojie's baby brother, too.

1005
01:05:39,064 --> 01:05:41,608
I didn't think she would give birth already.

1006
01:05:41,941 --> 01:05:42,859
Mom...

1007
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:46,571
Ojie's dad said the baby looks like Ojie.

1008
01:05:46,613 --> 01:05:48,615
But, the baby looks weird!

1009
01:05:48,656 --> 01:05:50,075
It looks like an old baby full of wrinkles.

1010
01:05:50,116 --> 01:05:52,452
Silly, all babies look that way.

1011
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:57,791
Right. But in a week or two,
he'll become a handsome baby.

1012
01:05:57,832 --> 01:05:59,793
Mom, is he also my brother?

1013
01:05:59,834 --> 01:06:00,627
Of course not!

1014
01:06:00,669 --> 01:06:03,213
But he can be if you want.

1015
01:06:03,463 --> 01:06:06,591
Auntie Elinor said I could make him my brother.

1016
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:09,386
You know, Mommy, I slept beside Auntie Elinor.

1017
01:06:09,427 --> 01:06:12,263
She let me feel the baby in her stomach.

1018
01:06:12,305 --> 01:06:16,393
We told each other lots and
lots of stories the whole day.

1019
01:06:16,434 --> 01:06:18,061
Mom, please bring me there again.

1020
01:06:18,103 --> 01:06:21,272
I don't really like staying in your office.

1021
01:06:21,314 --> 01:06:26,027
Auntie Elinor said I'm welcome
to go there, even every Saturday.

1022
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:33,952
The information should be complete
before you submit it to me, okay?

1023
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,553
Sister?

1024
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:55,265
What is it this time?

1025
01:06:55,473 --> 01:06:58,143
Can I take a day off tomorrow?
It's Saturday, anyway.

1026
01:07:15,285 --> 01:07:16,536
Press this.

1027
01:07:17,996 --> 01:07:19,164
It's working!

1028
01:07:19,205 --> 01:07:19,873
Really?

1029
01:07:19,914 --> 01:07:20,457
Yes!

1030
01:07:40,477 --> 01:07:41,686
Hi!

1031
01:07:44,022 --> 01:07:45,357
Wow!

1032
01:07:47,067 --> 01:07:49,069
Thank you, Maya!

1033
01:07:52,572 --> 01:07:53,948
Isn't he handsome?

1034
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:00,622
Thank you...

1035
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:03,416
I'm should be more thankful.

1036
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:05,502
Thank you, too.

1037
01:08:11,007 --> 01:08:12,509
Chubby little baby!

1038
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:13,426
Chubby boy!

1039
01:08:13,468 --> 01:08:15,679
You're hungry aren't you?

1040
01:08:16,596 --> 01:08:17,847
Time for milk!

1041
01:08:17,889 --> 01:08:19,683
Yes, it's time for milk now!

1042
01:08:19,724 --> 01:08:21,893
Okay, time for milk!

1043
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:23,353
Be careful, you might drop him!

1044
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:25,230
Don't worry. I'm used to taking care of babies.

1045
01:08:25,271 --> 01:08:28,608
I used to volunteer at an orphanage.

1046
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:29,609
Really?

1047
01:08:29,651 --> 01:08:32,070
It's part of our school curriculum.

1048
01:08:37,409 --> 01:08:38,451
Lea!

1049
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:39,786
Lea...

1050
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:43,498
Lea, your neighbor called.

1051
01:08:43,748 --> 01:08:45,959
Your children had an accident!

1052
01:08:52,632 --> 01:08:53,675
Ojie...

1053
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:01,349
Maya...

1054
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,228
Are they cousins?

1055
01:09:05,270 --> 01:09:06,771
No, they are siblings.

1056
01:09:16,781 --> 01:09:17,991
Ding...

1057
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:19,284
This is Raffy.

1058
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:20,952
Raffy, this is Ding.

1059
01:09:22,495 --> 01:09:24,122
They're the fathers.

1060
01:09:25,749 --> 01:09:26,833
Damn it!

1061
01:09:27,917 --> 01:09:29,002
Okay nurse, thank you.

1062
01:09:35,383 --> 01:09:36,676
What really happened?

1063
01:09:36,718 --> 01:09:38,011
Now you're asking.

1064
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:40,972
After giving priority
to your job over your children.

1065
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:43,224
I'll just be outside.

1066
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:52,150
You know, you're just perfect.

1067
01:09:52,442 --> 01:09:54,277
Even in front of other people!

1068
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:55,445
You, where were you?

1069
01:09:55,487 --> 01:09:56,738
With your mother!

1070
01:09:57,197 --> 01:10:00,575
Who bought the bike, was it me?

1071
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:02,786
I'm talking to you!

1072
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:04,621
Lea, wait!

1073
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:08,208
Lea! Don't turn away when I'm talking to you.

1074
01:10:08,249 --> 01:10:10,085
Can't we talk decently?

1075
01:10:10,126 --> 01:10:11,670
The kids already met an accident!

1076
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,588
They shouldn't be left by themselves.

1077
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:16,716
I can always take Maya to my mother.
But you won't allow it!

1078
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:18,927
Don't gang up on my mother!

1079
01:10:18,968 --> 01:10:20,929
Why did you stand up? Come here.

1080
01:10:24,724 --> 01:10:27,477
Do you have anything more to say?

1081
01:10:29,604 --> 01:10:31,356
Don't give me that attitude.

1082
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:33,525
You've been on my case since a few nights ago.

1083
01:10:33,566 --> 01:10:35,902
I haven't forgotten.

1084
01:10:36,152 --> 01:10:38,905
You were all 'No, Lea this' and "No, Lea that'.

1085
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,116
You're so kind to your wife!

1086
01:10:41,157 --> 01:10:45,787
But when I was your wife, you didn't even
bring me to the hospital when I gave birth to your son!

1087
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:47,914
What are you talking about?!

1088
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:50,500
Who didn't bring you to the hospital?

1089
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:53,294
Don't accuse me of something I didn't do!

1090
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:55,672
Lea, you're really stupid!

1091
01:10:55,714 --> 01:10:58,550
It was me! I didn't bring you to the hospital.

1092
01:11:01,011 --> 01:11:03,346
Right, I am stupid!

1093
01:11:03,388 --> 01:11:05,223
I'm stupid! I'm stupid!

1094
01:11:05,265 --> 01:11:06,891
That's why I have you as husbands!

1095
01:11:06,933 --> 01:11:10,061
- Hey, Lea we're in a hospital, stop shouting!
- Hey! Don't you walk out on me!

1096
01:11:10,103 --> 01:11:11,021
Wait! Lea!

1097
01:11:11,062 --> 01:11:12,981
Since you're such good fathers...

1098
01:11:13,023 --> 01:11:16,192
go ahead and take care of your own children!

1099
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:19,279
If you go, I'll take Maya to my mother's!

1100
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:20,739
I'll bring Ojie home!

1101
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,282
Go ahead!

1102
01:11:22,574 --> 01:11:25,744
To hell with you both! You can each have yours!

1103
01:11:44,888 --> 01:11:46,389
One...

1104
01:11:47,432 --> 01:11:48,892
Two!

1105
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,936
Go to hell!

1106
01:11:53,813 --> 01:11:55,482
Lea are you okay?

1107
01:11:56,649 --> 01:11:58,568
It really bugs me.

1108
01:11:59,652 --> 01:12:04,574
When two women with the same
man come face to face ...

1109
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:07,285
They claw at each other.

1110
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:10,955
If they don't, it doesn't feel right.

1111
01:12:14,292 --> 01:12:16,836
When my two perfect husbands met ...

1112
01:12:16,878 --> 01:12:19,172
instead of clubbing each other,
sthey ganged up on me?

1113
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:25,011
I just don't get it.

1114
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:27,097
Be quiet!

1115
01:12:27,138 --> 01:12:28,181
I'm not kidding.

1116
01:12:28,223 --> 01:12:31,059
I mean, they hit off like brothers.

1117
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:36,564
It's true I promise! I really don't get it!

1118
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:41,695
Because men are decent.

1119
01:12:41,986 --> 01:12:45,281
Civilized, my ass! That wasn't decent!

1120
01:12:45,573 --> 01:12:46,574
Hey, shut up!

1121
01:12:47,701 --> 01:12:49,619
Let's get out of here.

1122
01:12:51,246 --> 01:12:55,000
I don't know who is afraid of who.

1123
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:56,292
Okay, okay!

1124
01:12:56,334 --> 01:12:57,752
This is dragging on for too long...

1125
01:12:57,794 --> 01:12:59,254
One thing I don't get...

1126
01:12:59,295 --> 01:13:03,341
Doesn't it bother Ding that I
used to have sex with Raffy then?

1127
01:13:03,633 --> 01:13:07,137
Or does it bother Raffy that it's
Ding I have sex with now?

1128
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:09,806
Damn it, Lea...

1129
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:12,517
You know what? I bet you...

1130
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:16,646
They must have been lovers in their past lives!

1131
01:13:18,189 --> 01:13:20,358
Well then let them be!

1132
01:13:21,026 --> 01:13:23,361
Let them have sex!

1133
01:13:24,195 --> 01:13:28,992
My goodness, Lea there are other people around
and we're talking about sex!

1134
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,614
I want to do it.

1135
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,579
You really are crazy!

1136
01:14:32,847 --> 01:14:35,100
This is still half-full.

1137
01:15:05,005 --> 01:15:09,884
If a woman admits that she wants to have sex
does it make her a whore?

1138
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:11,094
Of course not!

1139
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:15,223
But then again...

1140
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:18,893
A whore doesn't really find real pleasure in it.

1141
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:22,772
How could she, when most men...

1142
01:15:22,814 --> 01:15:26,067
are all about hands or all about penises?

1143
01:15:34,284 --> 01:15:37,370
When I watch pornos on the VHS...

1144
01:15:38,496 --> 01:15:40,999
I can't get that thought out of my mind.

1145
01:15:41,624 --> 01:15:43,793
I find myself wishing...

1146
01:15:45,045 --> 01:15:51,676
I wish that when two people connect with their bodies,
they also connect with each other's soul.

1147
01:15:55,347 --> 01:15:59,601
I wish that when a man thrusts into a woman,

1148
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:03,688
he reaches the real core of her being.

1149
01:16:05,982 --> 01:16:09,611
That men may touch the
secret recesses of women's minds...

1150
01:16:09,986 --> 01:16:14,783
That he hears the words we don't utter.

1151
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:28,755
Sometimes...

1152
01:16:29,964 --> 01:16:31,633
I cannot help but think...

1153
01:16:35,011 --> 01:16:40,350
In the thousand times that
I made love to Raffy or Ding...

1154
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:48,942
They failed to touch my soul.

1155
01:16:52,862 --> 01:16:56,449
In my nakedness...

1156
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:00,537
I wish they realized...

1157
01:17:00,745 --> 01:17:04,165
That from head to toe...

1158
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:08,294
I am a mother!

1159
01:17:10,046 --> 01:17:11,965
I am a mother!

1160
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:27,522
Damn it, Johnny!

1161
01:17:27,564 --> 01:17:29,190
Damn them!

1162
01:17:29,482 --> 01:17:31,192
I'm not a bad person.

1163
01:17:31,484 --> 01:17:33,653
I'm not a bad mother!

1164
01:17:34,112 --> 01:17:36,281
I'm not a bad mother!

1165
01:18:47,852 --> 01:18:49,896
Happy New Year!

1166
01:18:57,696 --> 01:18:59,739
Happy New Year!

1167
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:09,874
Happy New Year!

1168
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,210
Happy New Year!

1169
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,770
This is all cheese, okay?

1170
01:19:30,812 --> 01:19:32,564
The table is ready.

1171
01:19:38,611 --> 01:19:41,281
Ojie, Maya, it's time to eat! Wash your hands.

1172
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:49,456
Dad said he would be back by Christmas.

1173
01:19:50,749 --> 01:19:54,794
It's only January.
You'll have to wait for December!

1174
01:19:56,546 --> 01:19:59,174
But where is your husband by the way?

1175
01:19:59,215 --> 01:20:02,218
The last time Mom saw him was All Saints' Day.

1176
01:20:04,012 --> 01:20:08,058
I think I'll be seeing him on Valentine's day.

1177
01:20:08,558 --> 01:20:09,726
Come on, let's eat!

1178
01:20:09,768 --> 01:20:11,561
What do you want darling? Sister?

1179
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:12,437
Here, Jinky.

1180
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:13,897
That's my classmate.

1181
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:15,565
How do you know?

1182
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:18,526
She called earlier. I told her to just call me again.

1183
01:20:18,568 --> 01:20:22,572
I didn't want to cry then.
It's not a good way to start the New Year.

1184
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:24,366
Why?

1185
01:20:24,407 --> 01:20:27,535
Mom, remember my classmate?

1186
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:29,913
The one whose father died in the fire?

1187
01:20:29,996 --> 01:20:32,290
The one with eight children?

1188
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:36,461
What about them?

1189
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:41,549
Elizabeth, our classmate, said that
the mother of our classmate just died.

1190
01:20:41,591 --> 01:20:43,426
She killed herself.

1191
01:20:46,513 --> 01:20:47,472
Hello?

1192
01:20:47,514 --> 01:20:49,224
Oh, Elizabeth! What is it?

1193
01:22:51,971 --> 01:22:53,640
By the way...

1194
01:22:55,433 --> 01:22:56,726
Here's a gift for you.

1195
01:22:56,893 --> 01:22:58,603
From me and the children.

1196
01:22:59,062 --> 01:23:00,730
Just put it there.

1197
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:08,488
Where's Maya?

1198
01:23:09,864 --> 01:23:12,409
Asleep. Do you want me to wake her up?

1199
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:14,703
No, I won't be staying long.

1200
01:23:14,744 --> 01:23:16,579
I just wanted to talk to you.

1201
01:23:17,622 --> 01:23:19,082
Let's sit down, okay?

1202
01:23:34,347 --> 01:23:36,057
I know I've been away for a long time.

1203
01:23:36,391 --> 01:23:37,892
It's okay.

1204
01:23:37,934 --> 01:23:40,270
There'll be other Christmases.

1205
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:45,608
I want to explain...

1206
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:48,695
I don't want a fight.

1207
01:23:51,448 --> 01:23:53,199
It all depends on you.

1208
01:23:55,452 --> 01:23:58,872
I want to work on our relationship.

1209
01:23:59,873 --> 01:24:02,208
I even made a list of New Year's resolutions.

1210
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,960
It's over between us.

1211
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:09,674
There's someone else.

1212
01:24:17,265 --> 01:24:19,976
It's been going on for quite some time now.

1213
01:24:20,477 --> 01:24:22,687
I just couldn't tell you.

1214
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:28,151
And it has reached the point
where I have to marry her.

1215
01:24:34,407 --> 01:24:36,117
When will the wedding be?

1216
01:24:39,579 --> 01:24:40,872
It's done.

1217
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:44,834
Last Christmas.

1218
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:27,711
Did you hear what I just said?

1219
01:25:27,752 --> 01:25:29,504
Lea...

1220
01:25:29,879 --> 01:25:32,173
I won't be sleeping here anymore.

1221
01:25:34,676 --> 01:25:36,428
Of course.

1222
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:38,805
You can't possibly...

1223
01:25:39,222 --> 01:25:40,890
Have sex here...

1224
01:25:41,307 --> 01:25:42,892
- and have sex there...
- Curse your foul mouth!

1225
01:25:42,934 --> 01:25:45,520
Damn you too! What do you call it then?

1226
01:25:46,438 --> 01:25:48,106
Fucking, screwing, sex...

1227
01:25:48,148 --> 01:25:49,899
It's all the same!

1228
01:25:50,233 --> 01:25:52,569
You're just ashamed to say it.

1229
01:25:54,529 --> 01:25:56,239
You're so ashamed...

1230
01:25:56,698 --> 01:25:58,908
That your wife,

1231
01:25:59,909 --> 01:26:02,871
had been another man's wife.

1232
01:26:02,912 --> 01:26:04,789
- That's not true!
- Yes, it is!

1233
01:26:05,832 --> 01:26:07,292
Go upstairs!

1234
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:19,471
You don't like to hear the truth
because you can't defend it.

1235
01:26:20,638 --> 01:26:22,390
That I'm a mistress.

1236
01:26:22,932 --> 01:26:24,893
And you're the other man.

1237
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,190
Damn it!

1238
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:34,819
What we had was not just a fling!

1239
01:26:53,296 --> 01:26:54,756
But to you,

1240
01:26:57,133 --> 01:27:00,095
This was just that.
Two people screwing around.

1241
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:03,056
If not...

1242
01:27:05,475 --> 01:27:08,603
Then why didn't you protect what we had?

1243
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:14,234
How about me?

1244
01:27:16,903 --> 01:27:18,613
For even just a little bit...

1245
01:27:20,281 --> 01:27:22,951
Why didn't you ever defend me?

1246
01:27:26,871 --> 01:27:28,581
At the very least,

1247
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:33,294
You could have given me another chance...

1248
01:27:39,634 --> 01:27:42,470
Even just the smallest chance...

1249
01:27:42,929 --> 01:27:46,224
to defend myself.

1250
01:27:56,026 --> 01:27:57,777
He's my father!

1251
01:28:00,822 --> 01:28:03,825
No one is taking your father away from you.

1252
01:28:04,617 --> 01:28:09,205
No one can take anybody away from anyone
because people don't own other people.

1253
01:28:10,874 --> 01:28:16,963
That's why everyone is given his own mind
so he can make his own decisions.

1254
01:28:18,131 --> 01:28:20,008
What will you do now?

1255
01:28:22,802 --> 01:28:24,304
Nothing.

1256
01:28:25,138 --> 01:28:27,182
I'll just have to accept it.

1257
01:28:27,932 --> 01:28:29,642
That's life.

1258
01:28:31,519 --> 01:28:33,146
Hard...

1259
01:28:35,231 --> 01:28:37,442
But you can do something about it.

1260
01:28:40,862 --> 01:28:43,573
Her father wants to get Maya.

1261
01:28:43,656 --> 01:28:46,117
Are you going to give her up?

1262
01:28:47,535 --> 01:28:50,747
Her father wants to get her.
Your father wants to get you.

1263
01:28:50,789 --> 01:28:52,957
You make your own decision!

1264
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:56,753
Why don't you make the decision?
You're the mother!

1265
01:28:57,462 --> 01:28:58,963
Because it's your life!

1266
01:28:59,005 --> 01:29:01,007
You should help us!

1267
01:29:02,425 --> 01:29:07,013
This is not like homework where
I can help you with the answers.

1268
01:29:18,733 --> 01:29:20,193
You can do it!

1269
01:29:20,235 --> 01:29:22,112
I've been through it too.

1270
01:29:22,153 --> 01:29:25,615
Tell her to help us think.

1271
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:27,826
Mom, please help us out!

1272
01:29:27,867 --> 01:29:31,955
What if we go with them and then
later on we want to go home to you?

1273
01:29:43,717 --> 01:29:45,844
I'll always be here, Maya.

1274
01:29:46,428 --> 01:29:52,475
Even if you go with your fathers,
I'll always be your mother.

1275
01:30:19,002 --> 01:30:21,921
Lea, put him in the car.

1276
01:30:24,257 --> 01:30:26,634
Hold her. I'll go find the other kids.

1277
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:30,013
The problems of this family never seem to end.

1278
01:30:30,055 --> 01:30:33,475
Two girls were brought to their relatives.

1279
01:30:33,975 --> 01:30:36,519
I heard that they're being molested by their uncle.

1280
01:30:36,561 --> 01:30:39,272
I told you that yesterday. They're over there.

1281
01:30:40,523 --> 01:30:41,941
Let's go children!

1282
01:30:42,817 --> 01:30:45,153
We're going to bring the children now?

1283
01:30:45,904 --> 01:30:49,324
Yes, no one is going to feed them here.

1284
01:30:51,242 --> 01:30:52,535
My children!

1285
01:30:52,577 --> 01:30:53,328
Get in the car!

1286
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:56,247
Lea, I just got a call from the center.

1287
01:30:56,289 --> 01:30:59,334
Go straight to the hospital after this.

1288
01:30:59,376 --> 01:31:02,921
The child who was raped by her father
had a nervous breakdown.

1289
01:31:02,962 --> 01:31:05,048
Take care of it, okay?

1290
01:31:07,133 --> 01:31:14,724
I told you, even if they have no father,
as long as you're there to be their mother.

1291
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:17,936
You shouldn't have left them!

1292
01:31:18,019 --> 01:31:22,190
Children can do without their father
but not without their mother.

1293
01:31:37,163 --> 01:31:40,625
There! That is our stage.

1294
01:31:40,667 --> 01:31:43,378
See! It's not overwhelming at all.

1295
01:31:44,671 --> 01:31:48,216
What I want to know is how I
can best introduce you.

1296
01:31:48,258 --> 01:31:50,510
Lea Bustamante will do.

1297
01:31:50,552 --> 01:31:52,637
I hope you don't mind.

1298
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:56,182
You could have given the children your surname.

1299
01:31:56,224 --> 01:31:59,853
You're single, you can do that.

1300
01:32:04,024 --> 01:32:06,568
The truth is, I'm married to Ojie's father.

1301
01:32:09,446 --> 01:32:11,406
In Maya's case,

1302
01:32:12,115 --> 01:32:14,534
I wanted her to have a name.

1303
01:32:14,826 --> 01:32:18,038
Although a woman never has a name of her own.

1304
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:23,293
She assumes the name of her father or her husband.

1305
01:32:25,003 --> 01:32:28,256
But if you will give Maya your name,

1306
01:32:28,298 --> 01:32:31,676
at least this time, her name will come from you.

1307
01:32:31,718 --> 01:32:33,053
And then,

1308
01:32:33,094 --> 01:32:36,973
she can tell the world that
her name is that of her mother's.

1309
01:32:37,015 --> 01:32:38,350
And you as well!

1310
01:32:38,391 --> 01:32:42,187
You can tell the world that
your daughter has your name.

1311
01:32:48,443 --> 01:32:51,654
Although no matter whose name a woman carries...

1312
01:32:51,696 --> 01:32:56,409
It is she alone who creates her own identity.

1313
01:32:56,743 --> 01:33:04,042
Because only she will make her
own mark in the world.

1314
01:33:12,217 --> 01:33:14,219
Well?

1315
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,348
Thank you.

1316
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:21,685
You're welcome.

1317
01:33:22,310 --> 01:33:25,563
Happy Women's Day my friend.

1318
01:33:25,605 --> 01:33:28,233
Happy Women's Day.

1319
01:33:30,443 --> 01:33:33,029
Your Aunt Aileen is nice.

1320
01:33:33,071 --> 01:33:35,907
She'll be like your own mother.

1321
01:33:36,282 --> 01:33:39,327
Your grandma also misses you a lot.
She hasn't seen you in a long time.

1322
01:33:39,369 --> 01:33:41,746
Tell her she can visit me anytime.
It's no problem.

1323
01:33:41,788 --> 01:33:47,293
That's why I want you to stay with us.
I miss you already!

1324
01:33:47,335 --> 01:33:50,338
But I can't leave my mother.

1325
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:52,507
I have only one mother.

1326
01:33:52,549 --> 01:33:55,176
You have only one father, too! Me!

1327
01:33:55,218 --> 01:34:01,599
Dad, I can't leave Mom
for all the grandmas in the world.

1328
01:34:01,641 --> 01:34:03,643
And come to think of it,
I don't even like grandma.

1329
01:34:03,685 --> 01:34:05,895
What if you won't see me anymore?

1330
01:34:06,688 --> 01:34:10,191
No problem.
I have a lot of your pictures anyway!

1331
01:34:11,901 --> 01:34:13,653
You're so hard to talk to.

1332
01:34:13,695 --> 01:34:18,324
You can get mad at me if you want to.
I still won't leave my mom.

1333
01:34:18,366 --> 01:34:20,535
She's my mother!

1334
01:34:23,413 --> 01:34:25,832
No, Dad. It's not because
no one will take care of her.

1335
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:29,210
Mom has lots of friends.

1336
01:34:29,294 --> 01:34:33,089
And besides, that's not the reason.

1337
01:34:33,131 --> 01:34:37,844
It's just that I don't want
to lose my mom nor my sister.

1338
01:34:56,321 --> 01:34:57,906
Are you angry?

1339
01:35:00,867 --> 01:35:03,328
No, I'm not.

1340
01:35:04,204 --> 01:35:07,123
You understand, right?

1341
01:35:09,542 --> 01:35:12,962
I really like Auntie Elinor.

1342
01:35:13,963 --> 01:35:16,841
But she's not my mother.

1343
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:37,946
The problem is solved, Mom.

1344
01:35:37,987 --> 01:35:40,323
We already told both our fathers.

1345
01:35:40,573 --> 01:35:43,201
We won't go with them.

1346
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:47,497
We won't exchange you for anything in this world.

1347
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:01,261
Happy Women's Day, Mom.

1348
01:36:01,302 --> 01:36:04,097
We love you very much.

1349
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:27,704
Do you regret anything about your life?

1350
01:36:28,621 --> 01:36:31,791
Me? About you and Ding?

1351
01:36:32,208 --> 01:36:35,712
Without you, I won't have my children.

1352
01:36:38,506 --> 01:36:40,842
Do you still love Ding?

1353
01:36:42,802 --> 01:36:45,680
You also want to ask whether
I still love you, right?

1354
01:36:47,307 --> 01:36:50,602
My answer is yes. I love you and I love him...

1355
01:36:51,311 --> 01:36:54,064
It's not that easy to understand
but it's the way it is.

1356
01:36:55,023 --> 01:36:58,234
If you love me, why did we end up like this?

1357
01:36:58,276 --> 01:37:01,112
Why didn't you come with me when I had to leave?

1358
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:05,158
Why did you leave when I couldn't go with you?

1359
01:37:07,494 --> 01:37:10,997
Because we are two independent people...

1360
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:16,336
Who wanted to do different things.

1361
01:37:23,218 --> 01:37:25,178
I lost you.

1362
01:37:27,514 --> 01:37:30,684
But if I clung on to you...

1363
01:37:31,101 --> 01:37:33,812
I would have lost myself.

1364
01:37:34,521 --> 01:37:38,108
How can you live with someone
who has lost her identity?

1365
01:37:38,149 --> 01:37:41,027
She'll never make a good wife.

1366
01:37:46,783 --> 01:37:49,619
Why did you ask me out?

1367
01:37:51,246 --> 01:37:52,288
No reason.

1368
01:37:52,831 --> 01:37:56,126
To say goodbye. Elinor and I are leaving.

1369
01:38:00,755 --> 01:38:03,508
Take care of the children, Lei.

1370
01:38:04,384 --> 01:38:06,928
And yourself too.

1371
01:38:11,141 --> 01:38:13,685
Are you happy, Raf?

1372
01:38:14,477 --> 01:38:16,271
Sometimes.

1373
01:38:23,737 --> 01:38:26,698
Do you understand, Raf?

1374
01:38:28,491 --> 01:38:32,537
That I won't ever be sorry
for anything in my life?

1375
01:38:33,246 --> 01:38:37,417
Not to you and not to anyone.

1376
01:38:38,168 --> 01:38:41,087
There's nothing to be sorry for.

1377
01:38:56,519 --> 01:39:00,732
Can you lend me just one more day of your life?

1378
01:39:00,774 --> 01:39:03,568
Let's give each other just one more day.

1379
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:05,653
What will we do?

1380
01:39:05,695 --> 01:39:07,322
Anything!

1381
01:39:07,781 --> 01:39:11,201
Let's go to the places where we used to go...

1382
01:39:11,284 --> 01:39:13,495
Eat the food we used to share...

1383
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:15,872
Drink from a single glass...

1384
01:39:15,914 --> 01:39:18,792
Swap stories, laugh together...

1385
01:39:19,417 --> 01:39:22,837
Dream and make memories.

1386
01:39:25,548 --> 01:39:26,800
Please, Raf?

1387
01:39:28,301 --> 01:39:32,055
Let's be crazy even just for a day!

1388
01:40:26,901 --> 01:40:29,529
Thank you.

1389
01:41:16,826 --> 01:41:20,246
I can't think of anything to say.

1390
01:41:27,921 --> 01:41:33,760
I can only think that not too long ago,
when Ojie was younger...

1391
01:41:35,053 --> 01:41:39,933
He was asking me how babies are made.

1392
01:41:43,144 --> 01:41:48,024
He stopped asking me that question.
Perhaps he has learned the answer.

1393
01:41:48,942 --> 01:41:51,069
Now you know the answer, Ojie!

1394
01:41:55,949 --> 01:41:59,536
But then, that question can easily be answered.

1395
01:42:01,162 --> 01:42:03,331
What's harder to answer...

1396
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:13,008
Is how can children grow up
to become decent human beings.

1397
01:42:16,011 --> 01:42:21,641
For if every child were molded in such a way,

1398
01:42:22,517 --> 01:42:27,397
then we would have a just
and decent society by now.

1399
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:30,942
One that we can proudly pass on to you.

1400
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:38,074
But we are still trying hard to achieve this.

1401
01:42:38,116 --> 01:42:42,620
Anything that can be done
to prepare a better future for you.

1402
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:49,669
Many of us try to make a better world for you.

1403
01:42:50,086 --> 01:42:52,630
For all of us!

1404
01:42:56,801 --> 01:43:02,057
To all of you, parents and children alike...

1405
01:43:03,099 --> 01:43:08,104
May you have a wonderful journey
of reaching for the stars!
