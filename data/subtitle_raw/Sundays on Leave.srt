THE HIGH SCHOOL GIRL

12
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:36,984
Wow, what a piece of ass!

13
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:43,026
Nice pair of drumsticks!

14
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,984
With a hot dish like that,
you gotta deliver.

15
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:04,150
An excitation-derivation motor...

16
00:04:10,927 --> 00:04:12,592
What kind of motor?

17
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:16,176
...excitation-derivation.

18
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:28,885
The intensity of the induced current
is 48.4 amp.

19
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,008
Find out the motor's nominal horse power

20
00:04:38,273 --> 00:04:44,372
and the rheostat's resistance
so that the torque load...

21
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:12,384
Where did this rubbish come from?

22
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:19,992
I want to know who had the nerve
to bring these to school.

23
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:23,638
It's Vizante, ma'am!

24
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:26,881
- It wasn't me, ma'am!
- Sit down.

25
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:33,754
If in five seconds
the guilty party doesn't confess,

26
00:05:35,007 --> 00:05:39,839
I'll call the principal and...
we’ll do an investigation you won't forget!

27
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:42,533
They're not mine, ma'am!

28
00:05:49,618 --> 00:05:51,018
It's mine, ma'am.

29
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:56,257
How dare you bring
contraceptives to school?

30
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:58,941
I thought they were eye vitamins.

31
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:01,430
My grandma
brought them from Hungary.

32
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:05,590
What if I made you swallow them
in front of the whole class?

33
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:15,575
What is the demographic policy
of our Party and our State?

34
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,978
Our Party and our State encourage...

35
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,343
What do they encourage?

36
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:27,251
...reproduction!

37
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:33,322
They encourage natality, Minzatu!
Natality, not reproduction!

38
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,512
No one's asking you
to reproduce yourself!

39
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:39,265
One copy of you is plenty!

40
00:06:43,423 --> 00:06:44,615
Well?

41
00:06:46,276 --> 00:06:48,677
I didn't have time to study.

42
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,095
I'm preparing
my college entrance exam.

43
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:55,069
Of course! With these pills
you prepare your exams!

44
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:56,270
No...

45
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:03,372
When I think of your parents
who bleed themselves white for you!

46
00:07:04,777 --> 00:07:06,609
See you next week.

47
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,106
The "eye vitamins" stay with me.

48
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:16,782
I hope they're expired
and you wind up with triplets!

49
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,600
At 200 a pack, palm them off
on your grandma instead!

50
00:07:30,982 --> 00:07:32,826
Leave me alone!

51
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:39,526
How's your secret love affair?

52
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,189
Fine.

53
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:42,995
Made up your minds yet?

54
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:44,260
To what?

55
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,641
To "do it".

56
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:48,197
Drop it, will you?

57
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:51,976
It's your business, but the longer
you wait, the harder it comes.

58
00:07:53,328 --> 00:07:55,661
Anyhow, I have a room for you,

59
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,296
- Leave her in peace, you jerk!
- What's up. Got a problem?

60
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,729
- No, no problem.
- The little creeps make me sick.

61
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:08,761
- You curious?
- I’m familiar with that subject!

62
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:10,701
Then there's no problem.

63
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:13,921
- Why should there be?
- I thought you had a problem.

64
00:08:14,282 --> 00:08:16,208
I have no problem. Maybe you do?

65
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:17,946
No. I have no problem either.

66
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:20,070
Then we have no problem.

67
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:22,592
Perfect!
Hope it stays that way.

68
00:08:28,564 --> 00:08:30,784
Theatre tickets!

69
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,664
Who wants theatre tickets?

70
00:08:34,318 --> 00:08:38,009
Anyway, it's mandatory.
Who's the treasurer?

71
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,499
What company's playing, please?

72
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,137
You being difficult?
How should I know?

73
00:08:45,296 --> 00:08:48,286
They're staying a week.
It'd be a disgrace not to go.

74
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:51,084
I'm exempt from gym.
Does it apply to theatre?

75
00:08:51,249 --> 00:08:53,963
We can exempt you
from school altogether!

76
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:57,505
Come on. 10 Lei per person...
Make it snappy!

77
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:11,280
The Municipal Theatre presents...

78
00:09:38,475 --> 00:09:40,557
Yes. Sure, dad.

79
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:43,019
Listen, the potatoes will burn.

80
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:47,065
Sure I should think of my future.

81
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:49,359
Sure, that's all I think about.

82
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:52,549
I can't get Radio Free Europe.
Who fiddled with the knob?

83
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:56,008
Right now,
my future is burning potatoes.

84
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:02,170
Must we talk about all this
over the phone?

85
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,857
Do you have a faucet open?
We're being flooded!

86
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:07,171
Tell him someone messed around
with my radio.

87
00:10:07,493 --> 00:10:10,314
It's not coming from us.
Come see for yourselves.

88
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:12,038
Good evening.

89
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,255
Good evening.

90
00:10:17,273 --> 00:10:18,939
Bunch of stoolies!

91
00:10:19,113 --> 00:10:21,793
You're to call back
about your private lessons.

92
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,739
Tuesday's no good.

93
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:27,796
Hey, this thing is busted!
I can't get Free Europe!

94
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:29,490
You'll be gone a week?

95
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:31,964
Don't worry,
my future can wait for a week.

96
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:34,270
Look, our ceiling's damp, too.

97
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:37,835
It's coming from upstairs.

98
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:47,105
Take care.
Yes. I'll get to work.

99
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:07,563
From the audition repertory I chose
"The Actors", a poem by Marin Sorescu.

100
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,151
"Always at ease, these actors!"

101
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:16,931
"Sleeves rolled up.
How casually they live our lives

102
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:21,261
"I have never seen a more perfect kiss"

103
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:25,273
"than the Actor's kiss, when Act Three"

104
00:11:25,862 --> 00:11:29,966
"unleashes finer feelings."

105
00:11:41,217 --> 00:11:42,800
Who's that?

106
00:11:42,984 --> 00:11:44,066
The artists!

107
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:45,228
The TV?

108
00:11:45,393 --> 00:11:47,776
You kidding?
Look at those slouches!

109
00:11:48,995 --> 00:11:50,827
Christ, they're so limp!

110
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:55,886
They sent us senior citizens!
Look at those fossils!

111
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,752
Christi, don't knock yourself out.
They're all clods.

112
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,515
- Can I buy you a brandy?
- With what? You're broke!

113
00:12:01,634 --> 00:12:04,011
No. I pawned the theatre tickets off
on two suckers.

114
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,814
Look at that one: he's the cutest.

115
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:10,342
Staroste?

116
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:12,064
Don't you know him?

117
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,251
Where from, military prep?

118
00:12:14,302 --> 00:12:16,808
He played in that series,
"Arms for the People".

119
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:18,839
He did all the Krauts.

120
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:26,168
How much could these guys make
in a month?

121
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,709
Don't look.

122
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:46,181
Quick, give him a drink!

123
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:47,488
I'm in pain!

124
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,265
What's wrong with him?

125
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,175
No time for explanations, Miss.

126
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,574
What, giving him water?!

127
00:12:53,599 --> 00:12:54,434
What, then?

128
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,349
- Vodka!
- There isn't any.

129
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:57,623
Whiskey!

130
00:12:57,648 --> 00:13:00,138
We only have Romanian brandy
and Fruti-ade.

131
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:02,013
- And what?
- Fruti-ade.

132
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:03,550
Send for the boss.

133
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:06,555
Trying to kill me, you viper?
Our love's gone?

134
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:09,518
You used to let me have it all
I didn't even have to ask.

135
00:13:10,611 --> 00:13:12,247
Wrong girl, comrade.

136
00:13:12,272 --> 00:13:14,376
If that's the way you take it...

137
00:13:14,401 --> 00:13:17,364
And when your mother caught us
in the wardrobe,

138
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:19,083
toots, remember that?

139
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:21,134
Better go see a doctor!

140
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,380
- Don't be vulgar.
 - It's a mistake!

141
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:27,566
What about us last night,
breaking the bed in glorious ecstasy,

142
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,173
was that a mistake, too?

143
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:32,411
Comrade. I’ve never seen you before,
so don't give me that crap.

144
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:35,449
A vodka or I'll spill the beans!

145
00:13:35,612 --> 00:13:36,680
You saw that?

146
00:13:36,726 --> 00:13:39,308
You'd never pull a stunt
like that on me, eh, sweetie?

147
00:13:39,797 --> 00:13:42,306
Kiss those 3-orgasms-a-night goodbye!

148
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:51,121
Cut the bullshit, you bunch of morons,
or I'll call in the militia!

149
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:56,437
Remember this, tart:
this guy really cared for you!

150
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:05,613
Soldiers, it's your turn:
the lady's all free.

151
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:22,097
Come on, boys...

152
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:25,390
Snap it up.

153
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,303
Want to see the game on TV or not?

154
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,241
No shit?

155
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,471
Why would I kid you?

156
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:43,825
She told me so this morning:
she’s nuts about you.

157
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,427
Christina?

158
00:14:48,165 --> 00:14:51,562
Everybody knows it.
She's been pining for you for months.

159
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:53,086
Make the first step, pisshead.

160
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:56,386
Break the ice. She's shy!

161
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,895
How should I...

162
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,437
You're clearly not at home
with chicks.

163
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:07,695
You take her hand...
Not like that! Gently.

164
00:15:08,128 --> 00:15:11,834
And rub her palm
with your middle finger.

165
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,542
Not too hard, or it'll bleed!

166
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:20,036
That's how you ask her
to go out with you.

167
00:15:21,409 --> 00:15:24,196
Then, she'll answer with her thumb.
Like this.

168
00:15:24,327 --> 00:15:29,357
And then, you ask her over tonight
to listen to your records.

169
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,494
Absolutely!

170
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,760
I have none!

171
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:34,869
Who cares? Girls understand.

172
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:38,756
Besides. I heard she's going out
with a soldier.

173
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,135
See what you've reduced her to!
What an asshole!

174
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:44,554
Hurry up. she's alone.

175
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:45,584
Be a man, will you?

176
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:48,860
Remember!
Your middle finger in her palm!

177
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:24,144
Want me to read your palm?

178
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:25,943
Know how?

179
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:27,373
Of course!

180
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,399
I should go wash my hands.

181
00:16:30,986 --> 00:16:34,110
Don't bother.
The lines show up better that way.

182
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:53,888
I can see the arrival of a person
who will change your life.

183
00:16:53,968 --> 00:16:55,735
Really? Where?

184
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:03,263
You will soon have
an important encounter

185
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,343
with a person who is, you know...

186
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:09,970
very close to you.

187
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:15,198
Want to come over tonight
listen to my records?

188
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:22,078
Sorry, tonight I have private lessons.

189
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:45,535
Train 651! Already 7 p.m.

190
00:17:45,876 --> 00:17:47,228
I'm late for my lesson.

191
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:50,546
Smoking again, you dopes?

192
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:55,065
Don't tell I took off.

193
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,910
Sure, if you have a lesson...

194
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:00,632
Say!

195
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:04,617
It's them you take private lessons with?

196
00:19:28,595 --> 00:19:29,438
Hi!

197
00:19:31,688 --> 00:19:34,422
I ran away, went AWOL.

198
00:19:34,904 --> 00:19:36,153
Can you imagine?

199
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:38,021
- I'm a deserter.
- You crazy?

200
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:40,724
I barely avoided a patrol.

201
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:42,415
- I don't believe you.
- I did!

202
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:45,893
I have to get back by 8:30 p.m.
for roll call.

203
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,331
By 8:30 I have to be back!

204
00:19:50,531 --> 00:19:52,687
You really went AWOL?

205
00:19:53,174 --> 00:19:57,860
Can you believe it?
A week before discharge!

206
00:19:58,324 --> 00:20:02,287
I also have a surprise for you.
I'll tell you later.

207
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:04,387
You stink the booze.

208
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:07,952
Down to work!

209
00:20:08,012 --> 00:20:11,760
I have to prepare all these for Thursday,
otherwise I'm in trouble.

210
00:20:12,358 --> 00:20:14,024
Just a second...

211
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:17,249
You have to be back by 8:30,
don't you?

212
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,391
Know I'm getting out by next week?

213
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,071
You've already told me. Get to work!

214
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:54,090
Can you believe
next week I'm out of the army?

215
00:20:57,639 --> 00:20:59,096
And I have a surprise, too...

216
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:00,921
- What?
- I'll tell you later.

217
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:02,092
What? Tell me now!

218
00:21:02,157 --> 00:21:04,489
"Integral from 3 to infinity..."

219
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:08,358
Tell me
or I'll bust your head open!

220
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:17,054
Stop! That's enough!

221
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:19,191
- A little more...
- Why, what do you want?

222
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:21,825
I want our friendship
to turn to deeper feelings...

223
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,659
We're trying to get smart, aren't we?

224
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:33,606
Living months on end in the barracks,
getting barked at day in, day out...!

225
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:37,398
That justifies jumping on people
and tearing off their clothes?

226
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:42,869
Every night in the dorms,
tolerating those swine and their smut...

227
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,687
Thinking of someone
who doesn't give a damn!

228
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:52,330
I think after 3 weeks
a guy can start undoing some buttons!

229
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:55,330
- Says who?
- But if there's no trust...

230
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:56,936
That's not the point.

231
00:21:56,986 --> 00:21:59,277
I told you,
for me it's very important:

232
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:02,056
doing it before marriage
is out of the question.

233
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,128
Engagement, at least...

234
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:07,679
That can be arranged.

235
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:15,066
Next week we'll have
the farewell night in the barracks.

236
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:17,066
The boys will arrange our engagement.

237
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,809
Was that the surprise?

238
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:21,353
What do you say?

239
00:22:21,868 --> 00:22:23,451
Whose idea was this?

240
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:26,028
Theirs. They want to meet you.

241
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:28,288
What do you mean, meet me?

242
00:22:28,332 --> 00:22:30,568
I told them we were together and...

243
00:22:30,844 --> 00:22:33,328
What do you mean, you told them?

244
00:22:35,057 --> 00:22:36,667
Why, wasn't I supposed to?

245
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:38,929
Why talk about it?

246
00:22:38,993 --> 00:22:42,325
What am I? A military secret
passed around from lip to lip?

247
00:22:45,623 --> 00:22:47,414
It was a joke.

248
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:51,052
Exactly!
I wanted to see your reaction.

249
00:22:52,185 --> 00:22:53,451
I sure had you going!

250
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:55,711
- It wasn't a joke.
- You got it wrong.

251
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:57,425
No, you got it wrong!

252
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,978
- What?
- That we were together!

253
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,661
I bet you were all eager
to have me listen to your records!

254
00:23:19,125 --> 00:23:22,093
It's the dawn of a new world, my dear.

255
00:23:23,046 --> 00:23:25,920
I can already feel its morning breeze.

256
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:30,756
You young folks must live a different life.

257
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:32,616
No shit!

258
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:36,016
Yes, grandma.

259
00:23:36,262 --> 00:23:38,647
What's Stephan doing?

260
00:23:39,328 --> 00:23:41,954
I have a bad feeling...

261
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,846
Stephan. I was worried!

262
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:50,928
Turn on the radio!
Haven't you heard the news?

263
00:23:55,089 --> 00:23:56,807
Please stay tuned...

264
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:04,502
Soon, we will read an announcement
of the utmost importance for the country.

265
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:13,836
Now I can tell you:
I'm a member of the Communist Party.

266
00:24:21,428 --> 00:24:24,246
Try to understand that my profession
is people's lives.

267
00:24:25,571 --> 00:24:31,185
Yours, his, hers...

268
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:39,047
And what are you asking me?!
Endanger a patient's life?!

269
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:44,420
For what?!
A job in the capital?!

270
00:24:45,977 --> 00:24:48,809
What court would acquit me
of such a crime?!

271
00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:51,961
Are you serious?

272
00:24:52,085 --> 00:24:59,898
You really think your measly existence
can influence life and death?

273
00:25:00,882 --> 00:25:02,341
You are wrong, Maria.

274
00:25:04,758 --> 00:25:09,464
The existence of each one of us
influences other lives and deaths!

275
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:13,351
You're under arrest, both of you!

276
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,511
It was you, wasn't it?

277
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,725
History avenges traitors!

278
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,249
- To the police headquarters!
- One moment!

279
00:25:45,874 --> 00:25:49,811
- God, it's freezing!
- 3 hours in an ice-box!

280
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,654
Had to wait for 30 minutes
in the cold!

281
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,300
Yes, it's tough.

282
00:26:06,283 --> 00:26:09,308
Tomorrow it will be over.
I'm a civilian again.

283
00:26:11,854 --> 00:26:13,603
Congratulations!

284
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,496
You thought it over?

285
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,003
Thought what over?

286
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,643
I, for one, have thought it over.

287
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,617
And you reached any conclusions?

288
00:26:30,815 --> 00:26:33,147
Don't want to see me anymore?

289
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:41,206
I have a busy week.
I'm behind with my homework.

290
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:45,146
I can't stay, the Lieutenant's here.

291
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:48,154
I'll wait for you
at the wagon anyway, around 7.

292
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:49,552
Anghel!

293
00:26:50,866 --> 00:26:52,523
Back to your seat!

294
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:24,828
Charity, boyar. God repays a hundredfold
souls who have pity on the poor.

295
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,940
Did I hear well?

296
00:27:28,016 --> 00:27:29,698
A hundred for one?

297
00:27:31,742 --> 00:27:34,041
That exceeds any usury!

298
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:50,111
Boyar, give what you can spare.

299
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,329
Such signs...

300
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,663
Such pious signs of the cross,
such crucified face.

301
00:28:15,924 --> 00:28:18,919
Obeisance of such grandeur...

302
00:28:32,402 --> 00:28:34,734
The mystery is solved at last!

303
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:36,258
Speaking to me?

304
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:38,449
Delighted.
My friends call me Dino.

305
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:40,711
Like in "The Flintstones"?

306
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:45,459
And you, besides signing "admirer" notes,
have you got a name?

307
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,206
What notes?

308
00:28:47,499 --> 00:28:50,221
Right, one-zero for you! Well?

309
00:28:51,979 --> 00:28:53,679
Christina Bachela-Burlacu.

310
00:28:53,735 --> 00:28:56,301
You go for bachelors, Christina?

311
00:28:56,815 --> 00:29:00,624
Sort of.
More than married men, anyway.

312
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:04,088
Two-zero for you.
Should we have coffee together?

313
00:29:04,355 --> 00:29:05,601
Never coffee.

314
00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:07,649
True. Here it's Fruti-ade or nothing!

315
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:10,754
That makes two to one!

316
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:17,356
May I have an autograph?
I saw you in a movie.

317
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:20,986
Congratulations!

318
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,433
Thank you.

319
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:27,979
Wait for two seconds while
I go remove my make-up, will you?

320
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:38,919
"We swore, our hands
firmly grasping the flag..."

321
00:29:44,528 --> 00:29:47,860
"Always at ease, these actors!"

322
00:29:48,324 --> 00:29:52,680
"Sleeves rolled up.
how casually they live our lives!

323
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:59,465
"I have never seen a more perfect kiss
than the Actor's kiss."

324
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,916
"when Act Three unleashes finer feelings."

325
00:30:03,374 --> 00:30:05,721
"Whereas we, stuck with our one life..."

326
00:30:05,794 --> 00:30:06,978
One life!

327
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:09,223
Not several. Not dozens of roles.

328
00:30:09,728 --> 00:30:11,770
"Even that life.
we're not living it right."

329
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:15,683
"Inarticulate as we are,
tiresome and ugly..."

330
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,955
Disgust: "Tiresome, ugly"

331
00:30:18,006 --> 00:30:20,916
"...not knowing what the hell
to do with our hands."

332
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:33,111
That was lousy.

333
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:39,975
Then how was it?

334
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:46,951
It was fresh.

335
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:50,651
It was lousy. What time is it?

336
00:30:51,525 --> 00:30:53,578
- It's early.
- That means?

337
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:55,565
Have an appointment?

338
00:30:55,883 --> 00:30:57,086
What's the time?

339
00:30:57,514 --> 00:30:59,306
- Eleven o'clock.
- Show me.

340
00:31:01,503 --> 00:31:05,064
Taste that wine, it’s from my aunt's.
Shouldn't miss it.

341
00:31:05,422 --> 00:31:06,887
Show me your watch.

342
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:09,635
What a mule! It's eleven-thirty.

343
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,262
Let me see!

344
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,674
I won't let you play with my watch!
Ten past midnight.

345
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:17,851
Believe me. Why should I lie?

346
00:31:18,024 --> 00:31:20,877
I believe you.
It's late. I must go home.

347
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:23,690
Wait a second! What's the rush?

348
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,636
At least finish your glass!

349
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,611
Let's toast: good luck on your audition!

350
00:31:32,315 --> 00:31:33,556
Okay.

351
00:31:35,787 --> 00:31:39,024
But tell me, why'd you pick
this line of work?

352
00:31:40,504 --> 00:31:42,211
It was lousy. I knew it.

353
00:31:42,383 --> 00:31:43,839
On the contrary.

354
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:47,156
If it had been, I'd encourage you.

355
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,166
That's how I deal with competition.

356
00:31:53,402 --> 00:31:56,575
I want to become an actress,

357
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:00,559
so I can live inside different characters.

358
00:32:00,608 --> 00:32:02,221
Do you have the ostrich's stomach?

359
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,575
Beg your pardon?

360
00:32:05,271 --> 00:32:06,627
Can you swallow anything?

361
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:11,503
Dry bread, nights on the train,
lousy roles in plays that make you throw up,

362
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:14,531
freezing small-town theatres, all that?

363
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:20,051
Yes. Anything to be there on stage.

364
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:24,611
For my people to say:
"She's from our town!"

365
00:32:27,784 --> 00:32:30,011
I can't. I used to.

366
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:32,493
But I've had enough.

367
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:36,458
It's useless. In this country,
no one gives a shit about talent!

368
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:42,406
It all comes down to having fun,
drinking, and laying pretty girls.

369
00:32:42,864 --> 00:32:44,205
That's what I do.

370
00:32:44,813 --> 00:32:47,026
I go on stage only to get my pay.

371
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:49,687
It's a rotten job,

372
00:32:49,725 --> 00:32:51,515
believe me!

373
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:54,681
You think "outside" it's the same?

374
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,448
How do you know?
Have you travelled there?

375
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:02,838
No, but a buddy of mine defected.

376
00:33:03,337 --> 00:33:04,798
Why not follow him?

377
00:33:06,272 --> 00:33:08,663
He became a taxi driver.

378
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:11,191
So you don't want to leave?

379
00:33:11,543 --> 00:33:13,070
Maybe I do.

380
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:15,483
You want to leave?

381
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:19,438
None of your business.

382
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:25,732
Okay, so he's a taxi driver.

383
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:28,405
Everyone knows
it's hard at the beginning.

384
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:32,857
You have to believe in yourself
as an actor.

385
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:36,699
"...Not knowing what the hell to do
with our hands."

386
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:39,576
No one makes it right off.

387
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:43,701
Why are you resigning?

388
00:33:43,923 --> 00:33:45,851
Why do you give up so easily?

389
00:33:51,216 --> 00:33:52,623
You have to insist!

390
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:54,509
I'll insist!

391
00:33:54,932 --> 00:33:56,516
You have to fight!

392
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:58,543
I will fight!

393
00:34:08,985 --> 00:34:12,425
You can't let time slip by like that!

394
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,931
If I were in your shoes...

395
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:32,813
You're right.

396
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:36,139
I won't waste any more... time.

397
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:38,513
I'll learn the language.

398
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:42,277
I can be very ambitious.

399
00:34:42,988 --> 00:34:44,634
Wait, let me tell you!

400
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:47,388
I'll make it out there, understand?

401
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:51,514
Here, they screwed me over.

402
00:34:51,993 --> 00:34:53,330
But I'll make them...

403
00:34:54,277 --> 00:34:55,603
You listening?

404
00:34:55,836 --> 00:34:59,589
I'll make them green with envy!

405
00:35:01,863 --> 00:35:03,276
Listen!

406
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:08,300
They'll say, "That guy who makes
half a million dollars a year"

407
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,826
"was from here, from Romania"

408
00:35:11,044 --> 00:35:13,084
I will...

409
00:35:17,246 --> 00:35:21,507
Leaving me,
after all that's gone on between us?

410
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:26,440
Don't tug on my jacket!
The buttons will pop!

411
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,281
Hands off my suitcase.

412
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:31,460
If you really don't want me anymore,
I'll set you free.

413
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:34,385
Just say, “Nicoletta.
I don't want you anymore!”

414
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,398
Leaving?

415
00:35:53,467 --> 00:35:55,966
I must. In the morning I have school.

416
00:35:56,058 --> 00:35:57,723
School?

417
00:35:57,964 --> 00:36:00,960
Shit, a school girl!

418
00:36:02,081 --> 00:36:04,426
Yes. I'm off.

419
00:36:04,907 --> 00:36:07,133
Can you lend me some cash
so I can take a taxi home?

420
00:36:09,296 --> 00:36:11,474
In my pants.

421
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,891
I'm sorry, I mean...

422
00:36:38,687 --> 00:36:39,924
about last night.

423
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,071
Don't apologize.

424
00:36:44,268 --> 00:36:46,226
It was a lack of concentration.

425
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:48,066
Mental blockage, see?

426
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:54,563
Couldn't get my mind off that business,
about having failed...

427
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:57,301
I mean as an actor.

428
00:36:59,632 --> 00:37:01,131
Put it back, please.

429
00:37:04,164 --> 00:37:06,106
Who's this?

430
00:37:08,563 --> 00:37:13,803
There's even a dedication:
"Watch your step. Carmen."

431
00:37:14,638 --> 00:37:16,776
I didn't know you were married!

432
00:37:17,853 --> 00:37:19,425
It's my mother, in her prime.

433
00:37:22,258 --> 00:37:23,924
Wise guy!

434
00:37:24,051 --> 00:37:25,772
Must be her, trying to reach you.

435
00:37:38,696 --> 00:37:40,220
Who's there?

436
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:42,253
Hello? Who’s speaking?

437
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,843
Ciao. I'm off.

438
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:57,553
Goodnight, pussycat.

439
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:25,988
Erotic feeling in Cosbuc's poetry...

440
00:38:30,356 --> 00:38:32,375
I’m listening, Christina.

441
00:38:37,335 --> 00:38:40,417
Cosbuc is a solar poet...

442
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:46,648
In his world, love is simple...

443
00:38:50,522 --> 00:38:52,231
happy...

444
00:38:56,478 --> 00:38:58,725
in a nakedness...

445
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:18,152
Sorry.

446
00:39:18,682 --> 00:39:20,461
They left at noon.

447
00:39:21,953 --> 00:39:24,059
You should've come earlier.

448
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,961
And they left... for good?

449
00:39:29,123 --> 00:39:30,728
Took the bus!

450
00:39:31,516 --> 00:39:34,496
They were all excited.
Said they're off to play in Bucharest.

451
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:38,883
Say, the maid who did up the room
found a broken glass.

452
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:45,491
Leave some 50 lei,
otherwise I'll get yelled at.

453
00:39:54,945 --> 00:39:57,071
Bucharest. One-way.

454
00:40:24,651 --> 00:40:27,805
THE ACTOR

455
00:40:36,955 --> 00:40:39,317
One, two, three, four.

456
00:40:39,672 --> 00:40:42,626
Some data on the urban area
that will host us...

457
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:48,421
Got something to eat?

458
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:55,507
A picturesque town close to
the Danube and to the border with...

459
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:58,490
Aus-tra-li-a!

460
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,076
Yugoslavia, assholes!

461
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,063
And don't let that give you any ideas!

462
00:41:06,227 --> 00:41:08,675
80000 inhabitants,

463
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:15,079
3 main restaurants.
one of which open till 10 p.m.

464
00:41:19,941 --> 00:41:21,128
Stop it!

465
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:22,848
- Crackers?
- That's life!

466
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:26,123
A lovely park, a library...

467
00:41:32,503 --> 00:41:35,958
A textile mill with female staff...

468
00:41:41,355 --> 00:41:43,812
A co-ed high school!

469
00:41:45,729 --> 00:41:47,533
Something wrong with your private life?

470
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:50,113
No more homemade pies and cakes?

471
00:41:50,171 --> 00:41:51,527
Did you break up?

472
00:41:51,683 --> 00:41:55,383
You on the moon? Yesterday
was our 3rd appearance in court.

473
00:41:56,229 --> 00:41:57,933
No joke! Getting divorced?

474
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,589
And nothing at all
for us, women?

475
00:42:00,662 --> 00:42:07,525
…and two regiments with an army club
where they give balls for the officers.

476
00:42:13,861 --> 00:42:18,704
- Mr. Dino, you owe me 300 lei.
- Since when? I don't remember.

477
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:23,822
Back in 1929, during the Depression...

478
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,715
Lucia, did you hear the latest news?
This fella's getting divorced!

479
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,488
Really? Congratulations!

480
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:33,249
Look at the gorgeous dame he's dropping!

481
00:42:33,288 --> 00:42:35,301
All men carry a picture when they divorce

482
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:38,097
for other chicks to see how they regret it.

483
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:40,524
- And all this started from…
- Love.

484
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,260
No, I mean for the divorce!

485
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,329
She's crazy. Green with jealousy.

486
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:46,823
She sees me as a kind of Casanova.

487
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,962
Outrageous!

488
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,762
Look. I'm watched over enough as it is.

489
00:42:51,066 --> 00:42:56,348
Censorship in the theatre, militia
in the street. I don't need KGB in bed!

490
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:01,188
She spies on my every move.

491
00:43:01,851 --> 00:43:05,158
Sometimes I watch the sunset
through my window...

492
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:09,099
To her I'm eyeing some girl
in the opposite building.

493
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,650
The dentist you told me about,
chasing you around, drill in hand?

494
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:15,921
No, that one lived elsewhere.

495
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:18,415
Anyway, I've had it.

496
00:43:18,948 --> 00:43:21,387
At home she's Othello. I'm Desdemona.

497
00:43:21,508 --> 00:43:24,186
And Iago? Who does Iago?

498
00:43:29,798 --> 00:43:32,570
It's hopeless, that thing is stuck.

499
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:43,444
You lend me this tart for tonight?

500
00:43:43,571 --> 00:43:45,902
Help yourself, I know her inside out.

501
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:50,072
- How about a vodka?
- It's a must! Where?

502
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:51,759
Straight ahead!

503
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,993
Where're you taking me, you beast?

504
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:07,488
You see what I see?

505
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,953
Fresh meat!

506
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,209
I like it here, there's tourist material!

507
00:44:14,267 --> 00:44:15,936
Modest, but tidy!

508
00:44:16,008 --> 00:44:19,850
Poor little things,
they're drinking us in.

509
00:44:22,212 --> 00:44:24,825
I call this thirst for culture!

510
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:34,295
How about our old number?

511
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:43,236
Quick, give him a drink!

512
00:44:54,757 --> 00:44:56,172
Come on, let's get started!

513
00:44:56,399 --> 00:44:58,148
Wait till they finish this game.

514
00:44:58,759 --> 00:44:59,965
Double fours.

515
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,868
- The audience?
- Lukewarm.

516
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,665
Okay, let's get started!

517
00:45:03,739 --> 00:45:06,165
I've nothing to hit the gong with.

518
00:45:06,235 --> 00:45:09,691
- A ball-pen will do?
- Don't bother, hit it with your head!

519
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,231
Very funny!

520
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:13,739
Come on, use your head,
that's what it's meant for!

521
00:45:14,346 --> 00:45:17,793
You all give me the creeps.
Watch it!

522
00:45:24,628 --> 00:45:26,376
- Mr. Staroste?
- Himself.

523
00:45:26,588 --> 00:45:28,900
There's a note for you at the stage door.

524
00:45:28,998 --> 00:45:30,128
For me?

525
00:45:32,044 --> 00:45:34,334
- Bad news?
- I'd say quite the contrary.

526
00:45:34,515 --> 00:45:36,579
I come pick it up at intermission.

527
00:45:37,837 --> 00:45:40,905
Tracts must be handed out
all around the city's key points.

528
00:45:41,716 --> 00:45:44,023
Contact the Party cells in prisons!

529
00:45:44,085 --> 00:45:46,663
Six and four.
I block, you're out!

530
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:50,271
I spoke to comrade Stere:
time is running out!

531
00:45:50,413 --> 00:45:51,995
Two... and two. Your turn.

532
00:45:52,139 --> 00:45:54,817
Comrades, I brought the manifesto.

533
00:45:54,928 --> 00:45:56,427
I worked on it all night long.

534
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:58,046
Unroll it, let's see.

535
00:46:08,605 --> 00:46:11,842
Yes, it's exactly what we hoped for.

536
00:46:12,293 --> 00:46:14,334
The comrades will be satisfied.

537
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:23,428
Comrade Stephan!

538
00:46:24,514 --> 00:46:25,744
Did you hear?

539
00:46:26,274 --> 00:46:28,184
The police raided our place.

540
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,611
They confiscated everything.
5 comrades were arrested.

541
00:46:32,662 --> 00:46:36,041
I know. If it's of any comfort to you,
we nabbed the traitors.

542
00:46:36,396 --> 00:46:39,008
Where are those dirty rats?

543
00:46:40,028 --> 00:46:41,611
In Securitate.

544
00:46:42,772 --> 00:46:44,938
We'll deal with them in due time.

545
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,253
- You gave me a jolt.
- Why?

546
00:46:52,624 --> 00:46:56,374
See, I'm not against gags on stage,
but there are limits.

547
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:59,713
Funny thing the officials didn't stop
the performance, but there are limits.

548
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:01,079
The poster stunt bug you?

549
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:03,223
Who gives a shit about the poster?

550
00:47:03,538 --> 00:47:05,197
- What you said on stage?
- When?

551
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:08,079
- After "Where are those dirty rats?"
- "In security."

552
00:47:08,343 --> 00:47:10,800
Didn't say "in security".
Said "in Securitate"!

553
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:12,841
Not the same thing.

554
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,230
'Where are those dirty rats?
In Securitate."

555
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:18,892
Relax, nobody picked it up.

556
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:23,840
- Congratulations!
- What for?

557
00:47:23,939 --> 00:47:26,395
The one with the Securitate.
Excellent!

558
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:33,704
"I'm 18, and I want you more
than anything in the world."

559
00:47:34,775 --> 00:47:37,649
"We never met,
but I follow you like a shadow."

560
00:47:38,376 --> 00:47:39,740
"An admirer."

561
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:43,718
Whose handwriting is that?

562
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:45,080
Mine.

563
00:47:46,013 --> 00:47:47,678
For the person didn't come in person.

564
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:49,799
She dictated it over the phone.

565
00:47:50,573 --> 00:47:52,030
You don't say!

566
00:47:54,389 --> 00:47:56,191
Mr. Actor...

567
00:48:00,414 --> 00:48:02,780
In here, the play
comes over the speaker.

568
00:48:02,823 --> 00:48:05,563
You had them nailed,
the rats from the Securitate!

569
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:07,099
Super!

570
00:48:24,498 --> 00:48:27,006
So we get nothing to fuck tonight?

571
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:30,039
Dino, know what your problem is?

572
00:48:30,147 --> 00:48:31,646
No, tell me.

573
00:48:31,886 --> 00:48:34,217
You spend your life with your fly open!

574
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:37,927
I'm tied down hand and foot,
I hit with what's left.

575
00:48:38,446 --> 00:48:42,090
As you wish. Just don't saw off
the branch under yourself.

576
00:48:42,157 --> 00:48:43,546
Don't overdo it.

577
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:44,854
Meaning?

578
00:48:44,953 --> 00:48:48,514
Cool down with the allusions
to the Securitate.

579
00:48:48,716 --> 00:48:50,826
I didn't even realize.

580
00:48:50,871 --> 00:48:52,483
Don't expose yourself.

581
00:48:52,624 --> 00:48:54,664
The company veterans are stoolies.

582
00:48:54,729 --> 00:48:58,105
You never know
the reports come from.

583
00:48:58,795 --> 00:49:00,115
This is just kid stuff.

584
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:05,431
- Ask me where the rats are.
- Where are the rats?

585
00:49:05,798 --> 00:49:08,496
- In security.
- Correct.

586
00:49:09,569 --> 00:49:11,660
"It's getting harder and harder for me"

587
00:49:11,747 --> 00:49:16,345
"to live without feeling
your body close to mine.

588
00:49:16,973 --> 00:49:21,321
"Alas. I'm in the audience
while you're on stage."

589
00:49:21,404 --> 00:49:22,472
So what? That's normal!

590
00:49:22,857 --> 00:49:24,147
"An admirer."

591
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:26,150
Wonderful thoughts!

592
00:49:26,686 --> 00:49:28,470
What a strange handwriting though!

593
00:49:28,528 --> 00:49:30,568
Handwriting's mine.

594
00:49:30,786 --> 00:49:32,243
Over the phone again?

595
00:49:33,224 --> 00:49:36,182
This chick's got class:
she's dictating by phone!

596
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:38,673
Lets go, this is giving me headaches.

597
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:42,988
Double sixes, you're up the creek!

598
00:49:45,088 --> 00:49:47,058
Take that, cocksucker!
Double sixes, too!

599
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:48,569
Lucky ass!

600
00:49:49,993 --> 00:49:52,546
Pow! Another pair of sixes!

601
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:57,541
Jesus, double sixes!
Looks like we're hot!

602
00:49:57,921 --> 00:50:01,985
No, looks like
we're being taken for a ride!

603
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:06,983
This guy won't die in his bed!

604
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:11,370
You won't give in the conspirators?

605
00:50:11,569 --> 00:50:13,668
Don't worry,
we'll teach you how to talk!

606
00:50:13,807 --> 00:50:16,270
Smash his teeth out!

607
00:50:16,321 --> 00:50:21,269
Yeah, beat him to a pulp,
that motherfucker who loaded our dice!

608
00:50:22,594 --> 00:50:24,236
You'll get nothing out of me.

609
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:28,253
Talk!

610
00:50:29,499 --> 00:50:30,908
Spit it out!

611
00:50:31,007 --> 00:50:32,490
Cough it up!

612
00:50:44,061 --> 00:50:45,716
Stop it...

613
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:50,029
Stop it...

614
00:50:52,391 --> 00:50:54,152
I said stop it!

615
00:50:59,488 --> 00:51:01,608
"I would like to see us entwined..."

616
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:07,970
"naked under a fountain of champagne."

617
00:51:09,094 --> 00:51:13,328
"Our encounter
is becoming inevitable. An admirer."

618
00:51:13,924 --> 00:51:16,242
She's got it bad!

619
00:51:17,539 --> 00:51:19,913
"Naked under a fountain of champagne..."

620
00:51:21,195 --> 00:51:24,193
What could a girl
who writes such things look like?

621
00:51:24,745 --> 00:51:26,036
A cunt!

622
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:29,383
That's why you don't make it in life.

623
00:51:29,768 --> 00:51:31,515
No imagination!

624
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:36,322
What if she was a real fox?

625
00:51:39,019 --> 00:51:40,768
Sweet dreams, Dino.

626
00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:50,820
I guess we don't get laid tonight either...

627
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,983
Yes, grandma.

628
00:51:56,659 --> 00:51:58,937
Stephan, I was worried.

629
00:51:59,827 --> 00:52:02,200
Turn on the radio!
Haven't you heard the news?

630
00:52:04,008 --> 00:52:08,828
"Please stay tuned..."

631
00:52:18,284 --> 00:52:20,658
This is Radio Free Europe.

632
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:34,859
Good morning, dear listeners.

633
00:52:46,763 --> 00:52:51,831
Now I can tell you:
I'm a member of the Communist Party.

634
00:52:57,667 --> 00:53:01,718
If that's the way some of us
understand theatre, we'll take measures!

635
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,845
This is no longer funny!

636
00:53:03,971 --> 00:53:05,761
This is called sabotage!

637
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:09,133
Tomorrow it'll make waves
all the way up.

638
00:53:09,346 --> 00:53:12,693
Why look at me? I told you:
Tonight, I'm clean.

639
00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:18,421
Don't pull my leg! You're the only one
here who plays pranks on stage!

640
00:53:18,668 --> 00:53:22,488
And who loaded our dice?
I'd like to know!

641
00:53:22,608 --> 00:53:25,468
Fuck your dice, we're talking
serious business here.

642
00:53:25,517 --> 00:53:29,511
Just curious: how dare anyone
rummage through my tapes?

643
00:53:30,189 --> 00:53:33,308
You see, comrade Staroste,
I advise you to confess

644
00:53:33,483 --> 00:53:35,414
and spare us a collective blame.

645
00:53:35,495 --> 00:53:38,591
Listen, old witch,
 don't give me that militia crap!

646
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,117
How dare you talk like this to my wife?

647
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:44,846
If I slug you, they'll collect
your teeth from the balcony!

648
00:53:44,892 --> 00:53:48,018
Hold me, boys!
Hold me or I'll kill him!

649
00:53:48,043 --> 00:53:51,819
Calm down!
That's not the way to settle this.

650
00:53:51,922 --> 00:53:53,520
It wouldn't be worth it.

651
00:53:53,585 --> 00:53:55,186
Can I dismantle?

652
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:58,583
Yes. Everybody is going to bed!

653
00:53:58,682 --> 00:54:01,047
The main thing is
to go on with our work.

654
00:54:01,674 --> 00:54:04,608
We'll take up this discussion
after the tour.

655
00:54:04,766 --> 00:54:06,863
- You think it over.
- Okay, dismantle!

656
00:54:23,124 --> 00:54:26,078
You'd love to pass me the bill
for this!

657
00:54:27,773 --> 00:54:29,624
But what about evidence?

658
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:43,706
Don't worry, it'll blow over.

659
00:54:44,373 --> 00:54:49,056
Here. The weather report...
With the doorkeeper's compliments.

660
00:54:49,129 --> 00:54:50,409
You can keep it.

661
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:53,035
You nuts? Know what she says?

662
00:54:55,798 --> 00:54:59,916
"At the right time and place.
I'll come out in the open."

663
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:05,625
"Meanwhile, I'm dreaming
of sweet swoons in your arms..."

664
00:55:06,186 --> 00:55:08,064
The circle is tightening!

665
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,468
God, it's freezing!

666
00:55:20,557 --> 00:55:23,501
Three hours in an ice-box.
We won't survive!

667
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:25,995
The audience is in shirt-sleeves!

668
00:55:26,134 --> 00:55:28,754
The cold comes from behind the stage,
the auditorium's heated.

669
00:55:28,823 --> 00:55:31,829
Wait till the curtain rises,
they'll rush to their coats.

670
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:34,443
- Shall we play?
- Play, my ass! With what?

671
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:36,755
What do you mean, not play?

672
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:40,123
Mind your beeswax,
no one asked you. Got any dice?

673
00:55:40,275 --> 00:55:42,603
Hit the gong!

674
00:55:54,473 --> 00:56:00,293
Charity, boyar, God repays a hundredfold
souls who have pity on the poor.

675
00:56:53,962 --> 00:56:56,568
The mystery is solved at last.

676
00:56:56,674 --> 00:56:57,694
Speaking to me?

677
00:56:57,794 --> 00:56:59,485
Delighted.
My friends call me Dino.

678
00:56:59,688 --> 00:57:01,334
Like in "The Flintstones"?

679
00:57:01,556 --> 00:57:05,936
And you. besides signing "Admirer"
notes, have you got a name?

680
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,816
What notes?

681
00:57:17,973 --> 00:57:19,598
Company, repeat!

682
00:57:19,668 --> 00:57:23,018
"Proud fatherland, place of heaven..."

683
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:33,551
Working hard, huh?

684
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,711
Mr. Actor, another note!

685
00:57:39,108 --> 00:57:41,356
Well, everything's set.
Give it anyway.

686
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:47,569
- Was that her?
- Yes.

687
00:57:47,783 --> 00:57:50,069
Her looks are better than her writing, eh?

688
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,243
What do they all see in you?

689
00:57:53,349 --> 00:57:58,074
It's a matter of bio-currents!
I'll explain it to you sometime.

690
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:01,865
- She's waiting outside?
- Yes.

691
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:08,579
- And the last note arrives at last.
- You can have it.

692
00:58:14,402 --> 00:58:16,860
- Did you read this?
- What for?

693
00:58:18,575 --> 00:58:20,508
- "If you want my body..."
- Yeah?

694
00:58:20,941 --> 00:58:25,115
"...be on the train platform tonight at.
Your admirer."

695
00:58:29,815 --> 00:58:30,928
Then... she's not the same one!

696
00:58:31,006 --> 00:58:34,449
Right. Where do some people get
all these bio-currents from?

697
00:58:35,155 --> 00:58:39,158
- What should I do?
- With your physique. I'd try theatre.

698
00:58:42,111 --> 00:58:43,844
Old-timer, when did the girl call?

699
00:58:43,924 --> 00:58:47,591
While you were talking
to that doll around the corner.

700
00:58:50,257 --> 00:58:52,160
"Moscow's eye!" You miss nothing!

701
00:58:52,284 --> 00:58:54,134
Old age, son!

702
00:58:57,132 --> 00:58:59,657
So there are two subjects:

703
00:59:00,429 --> 00:59:04,288
one who writes notes
but hasn't shown herself yet,

704
00:59:05,177 --> 00:59:07,550
and another who's waiting outside.

705
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,128
I hope she's still waiting.

706
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:16,896
- "A bird in the bush..."
- "A bird in hand!"

707
00:59:17,008 --> 00:59:18,381
Wherever.

708
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:27,814
Here's what we'll do: I'll take
this one and see how I make out.

709
00:59:29,791 --> 00:59:34,396
You go to the hotel.
Wait there until 7:30.

710
00:59:35,568 --> 00:59:40,649
If I don't show up, you go
to the station in my place.

711
00:59:40,783 --> 00:59:43,532
Try your best, figure it out,
you're a big boy.

712
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:48,478
If I get it right.
I can have your leftovers?

713
00:59:50,242 --> 00:59:55,633
I'm offering you an honest deal:
I leave you the "admirer"...

714
00:59:55,831 --> 00:59:56,822
Really?

715
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:59,178
...you don't show up in the room
until morning.

716
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:01,540
Just so?
And where will I sleep?

717
01:00:07,621 --> 01:00:13,668
There's even a dedication:
"Watch your step. Carmen."

718
01:00:14,268 --> 01:00:15,759
I didn't know you were married.

719
01:00:15,895 --> 01:00:18,181
It's my mother in her prime.

720
01:00:18,927 --> 01:00:19,962
Wise guy!

721
01:00:20,927 --> 01:00:22,789
Must be her, trying to reach you.

722
01:00:26,073 --> 01:00:27,447
Dumitru Staroste?

723
01:00:28,652 --> 01:00:31,258
A word of advice:
cool it with that girl.

724
01:00:31,865 --> 01:00:34,811
Don't try to see her again.
It's for your own good.

725
01:00:35,408 --> 01:00:36,947
Who's there?

726
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:39,017
Hello? Who are you?

727
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,055
Hello, Bamboo? Give me Maybug.

728
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:45,162
5-3-1, answer 5-3-1, this is Bamboo,
 can you hear me?

729
01:00:46,604 --> 01:00:48,566
Ciao. I'm off.

730
01:01:30,555 --> 01:01:32,883
Seems like there's been
some action in here!

731
01:01:33,692 --> 01:01:35,511
Happy?

732
01:01:36,603 --> 01:01:38,623
It's a way to put it.

733
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,072
You went?

734
01:01:41,305 --> 01:01:42,669
And?

735
01:01:43,637 --> 01:01:45,011
A chick!

736
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:49,471
How was it for you?

737
01:01:50,088 --> 01:01:53,211
You know me.
When I aim, I score.

738
01:01:54,483 --> 01:01:58,414
Forget me.
How about the other weirdo?

739
01:01:59,554 --> 01:02:01,668
Tall, skinny, glasses...

740
01:02:02,188 --> 01:02:05,278
The egghead type.
Nothing for you there.

741
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:10,384
I said you were sorry you couldn't come,
you had something to read.

742
01:02:10,502 --> 01:02:12,063
Then what?

743
01:02:12,689 --> 01:02:14,370
We chatted.

744
01:02:15,176 --> 01:02:16,276
You sick?

745
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:19,484
What could you
and an egghead girl chat about?

746
01:02:21,891 --> 01:02:27,879
Schopenhauer... reincarnation...
Indian philosophy...

747
01:02:28,957 --> 01:02:30,646
What do I know?

748
01:02:35,154 --> 01:02:38,083
Listen, I have something to tell you.

749
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:42,234
I think the "boys" are watching me.

750
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,448
Like they're out to get me.

751
01:02:55,697 --> 01:02:57,612
He's nowhere to be found.
Shall we go?

752
01:02:57,989 --> 01:03:01,065
This is what shortens my life:
unreliable people.

753
01:03:01,178 --> 01:03:03,252
I said we were all to be on time!

754
01:03:03,298 --> 01:03:06,096
Let's wait for another I5 minutes.
Maybe he shows up.

755
01:03:06,173 --> 01:03:08,460
Let the jerk take the train!

756
01:03:10,052 --> 01:03:12,506
His bags are still in his room.
He couldn't have vanished.

757
01:03:12,633 --> 01:03:15,264
Too late. It's every man
for himself. Let's go.

758
01:03:15,457 --> 01:03:23,218
And next time, and next time.
We'll make it even bigger...

759
01:03:47,044 --> 01:03:50,059
Sir... Sir...

760
01:03:50,934 --> 01:03:53,559
I'll show you the passage, Sir.

761
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:56,803
200 lei. I show you the passage.

762
01:04:20,086 --> 01:04:23,193
THE SOLDIER

763
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:51,975
All here?

764
01:04:55,456 --> 01:04:57,533
Come on. Who's starting?

765
01:04:58,378 --> 01:04:59,795
Non-coms first.

766
01:05:04,897 --> 01:05:06,665
OK, Rexona, show your talents!

767
01:05:06,698 --> 01:05:07,986
Me next!

768
01:05:08,036 --> 01:05:10,854
We'll see how Rexona lathers.

769
01:05:44,956 --> 01:05:46,081
What?

770
01:05:47,142 --> 01:05:48,329
Who's there?

771
01:05:48,446 --> 01:05:50,355
Come closer and see for yourself.

772
01:05:57,584 --> 01:06:00,424
Stand! What're you supposed
to do after lights-out?

773
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:03,078
I had no special order, Sir.

774
01:06:03,734 --> 01:06:04,658
Duck!

775
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,399
After lights-out, the soldier
follows the sleeping program.

776
01:06:08,492 --> 01:06:11,670
- What were you doing outside?
- I was just...

777
01:06:12,739 --> 01:06:14,959
You know the lights-out call?

778
01:06:15,329 --> 01:06:17,532
Let's hear you sing it.

779
01:06:20,463 --> 01:06:23,014
Easy, you'll wake up
the whole regiment.

780
01:06:32,845 --> 01:06:33,811
Duck!

781
01:06:33,905 --> 01:06:34,971
Crawl!

782
01:06:47,452 --> 01:06:49,493
Belt and laces.

783
01:07:11,435 --> 01:07:13,771
I’m crazy about Geta.

784
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,893
Lieutenant..

785
01:07:24,343 --> 01:07:26,373
Had a good sleep, Your Excellency?

786
01:07:27,496 --> 01:07:28,329
I may just...

787
01:07:28,354 --> 01:07:31,256
Explain? Explain what?
That you drive me crazy?

788
01:07:31,741 --> 01:07:34,702
One minute I let you out of my sight
and it's a disaster!

789
01:07:35,379 --> 01:07:37,728
Look at yourself!
Fall off the Christmas tree!

790
01:07:38,437 --> 01:07:42,266
At shooting session, you break
your glasses with the rifle stock.

791
01:07:42,939 --> 01:07:44,470
I show up, and you're in the slammer.

792
01:07:45,381 --> 01:07:48,403
What happened?
You knocked a buddy's teeth out?

793
01:07:49,328 --> 01:07:51,288
Put someone in the infirmary?

794
01:07:51,492 --> 01:07:54,191
A visitor at the gate
for Private Anghel.

795
01:07:54,508 --> 01:07:55,864
Dismissed.

796
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:57,704
Wonderful!

797
01:07:58,206 --> 01:08:01,924
The minute you smell trouble, bingo!
Mum and Dad show up!

798
01:08:04,021 --> 01:08:05,834
Go ahead, they'll blow your nose.

799
01:08:06,557 --> 01:08:11,518
But I'm coming too. I want to be there
when they see you, no belt, no laces,

800
01:08:12,398 --> 01:08:14,554
fresh out of the slammer.

801
01:08:30,171 --> 01:08:33,711
Horatiu, go tell my boy I'm here.

802
01:08:34,191 --> 01:08:36,818
It's already half an hour I sent for him.

803
01:08:37,997 --> 01:08:41,486
Please Sir, give my son a pass...

804
01:08:47,129 --> 01:08:48,482
Hi!

805
01:08:52,693 --> 01:08:54,088
One second..

806
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,261
- Who's that one?
- His chick?

807
01:08:56,293 --> 01:08:58,397
A doll like her for that jerk!

808
01:08:59,366 --> 01:09:01,863
- It's his sister, calm down.
- No such luck!

809
01:09:02,036 --> 01:09:04,038
Stay in line. Non-coms first.

810
01:09:04,104 --> 01:09:07,349
I'm sick of cheating
on my private lessons.

811
01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:10,182
Come have a look at Horatiu's sister!

812
01:09:11,468 --> 01:09:13,481
Which one?
The legs down there?

813
01:09:14,102 --> 01:09:15,540
No bullshit!

814
01:09:16,776 --> 01:09:18,485
Where are your shoelaces?

815
01:09:20,237 --> 01:09:21,613
They're broken.

816
01:09:21,638 --> 01:09:23,556
All kinds of morons
playing jokes at night...

817
01:09:23,817 --> 01:09:25,026
Really?

818
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:29,147
No laces, no belt either!

819
01:09:29,701 --> 01:09:31,183
Coming from the slammer?

820
01:09:31,266 --> 01:09:32,830
Who told you?

821
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,694
We've been naughty, haven't we?

822
01:09:42,927 --> 01:09:44,305
- She's not his sister!
- Shit!

823
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:45,985
She's his chick! Help!

824
01:09:55,788 --> 01:09:59,798
Has Miss Burlacu come here before
to visit my men?

825
01:10:00,059 --> 01:10:01,380
Excuse me...

826
01:10:01,502 --> 01:10:03,003
There!

827
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,370
Miss Burlacu!

828
01:10:05,395 --> 01:10:07,341
The commander's daughter.

829
01:10:07,566 --> 01:10:10,501
What a lovely daughter
comrade Colonel has!

830
01:10:13,874 --> 01:10:16,165
Make yourself useful,
clean Horatiu's gun.

831
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:19,993
Sure, while he lolls in the slammer.

832
01:10:20,124 --> 01:10:21,790
- How long did he get?
-Two days.

833
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,709
And his chick visits him!

834
01:10:23,976 --> 01:10:28,056
What a great piece of ass for that jerk
while we bang that slut Rexona!

835
01:10:28,378 --> 01:10:30,137
Cool it, it was his sister.

836
01:10:30,162 --> 01:10:33,795
Change the fucking subject for once!
You've been harping on that for hours.

837
01:10:38,176 --> 01:10:40,376
Speak of the devil!

838
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:43,652
The return of the Pink Panther!

839
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:52,988
Take it and clean it.

840
01:10:54,746 --> 01:10:56,681
What, the lieutenant here?

841
01:10:56,801 --> 01:10:59,342
That's it, stupid, call him!

842
01:11:06,736 --> 01:11:10,471
Cards down, dickhead!
Who's the doll?

843
01:11:13,163 --> 01:11:14,456
Somebody.

844
01:11:14,571 --> 01:11:16,777
- He's asking for it.
- Thinks he's funny.

845
01:11:16,884 --> 01:11:18,587
We noticed she's some body!

846
01:11:18,612 --> 01:11:21,686
Joking aside,
is she an old school mate, or what?

847
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,446
Cool it, you bunch of shitheads!

848
01:11:25,485 --> 01:11:27,700
She's his girlfriend!

849
01:11:33,781 --> 01:11:35,335
Horatiu…

850
01:11:36,201 --> 01:11:39,388
No joke, is she your girl
from Bucharest?

851
01:11:40,995 --> 01:11:42,292
What's it to you?

852
01:11:42,394 --> 01:11:43,567
It's...

853
01:11:44,578 --> 01:11:47,456
I might use the address
when I get to the capital.

854
01:11:52,303 --> 01:11:55,118
She's a local.
I met her while on short leave.

855
01:11:56,099 --> 01:11:58,086
Just ran across her in the street?

856
01:11:58,205 --> 01:12:01,016
You relied on the prestige
of the uniform?

857
01:12:01,906 --> 01:12:03,238
I can't help you.

858
01:12:03,346 --> 01:12:06,433
While you always crowd
into your trains like cattle

859
01:12:06,639 --> 01:12:08,399
I prefer wandering around town.

860
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:12,059
My ass! You don't go home
because you're a lousy shot

861
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,980
and broke your glasses with your rifle.

862
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:19,024
And it'll be the same this week
since you were in the can.

863
01:12:20,339 --> 01:12:22,381
No bullshit: did you hump her?

864
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:24,821
Ashamed... talking to your pals?

865
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:28,103
- Did you score or didn't you?
- Him? With his pencil, maybe!

866
01:12:31,503 --> 01:12:37,303
- You obsessed? We've discussed it.
- You "discussed it"?

867
01:12:37,743 --> 01:12:41,051
Then it's in the bag.
They "discussed it".

868
01:12:43,658 --> 01:12:45,278
She won't before engagement.

869
01:12:45,316 --> 01:12:47,729
- Getting engaged? When?
- Soon, don't worry.

870
01:12:47,851 --> 01:12:50,622
- Bring her here, we'll get you engaged.
- Thanks, we'll manage.

871
01:12:50,686 --> 01:12:52,567
I see! She's his piano teacher!

872
01:12:53,933 --> 01:12:56,581
She's making you
exercise your fingers?

873
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:58,900
She's his nanny, brings his laundry.

874
01:12:59,005 --> 01:13:00,813
He thinks we're dumb!

875
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:05,445
You really want me
to bring her here?

876
01:13:07,153 --> 01:13:08,908
I would, if were you.

877
01:13:09,054 --> 01:13:11,055
You don't think I can, do you?!

878
01:13:13,656 --> 01:13:17,825
Sure you can, buddy.
I’m all on your side.

879
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:22,269
- But there're some of us who doubt it.
- Who doubts it?

880
01:13:24,932 --> 01:13:27,511
Now who believes him?

881
01:13:30,965 --> 01:13:32,841
See, there's a problem.

882
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:38,269
Here's what I suggest: the night of
our farewell party, you bring your chick.

883
01:13:38,653 --> 01:13:42,320
I'll show you how to get her inside,
and we’ll get you engaged.

884
01:13:42,976 --> 01:13:44,875
You kill two birds with one stone:

885
01:13:44,949 --> 01:13:47,882
solve the girl's problem
and win your comrades' trust.

886
01:13:48,288 --> 01:13:50,989
- He's got no balls for it.
- Want to bet?

887
01:13:51,264 --> 01:13:53,169
50 lei each?

888
01:13:54,089 --> 01:13:55,494
50 lei each.

889
01:14:03,977 --> 01:14:06,604
Anghel! In my office!

890
01:14:10,188 --> 01:14:14,601
- And you don't know who she is?
- What do you mean?

891
01:14:16,303 --> 01:14:18,470
It never occurred to you

892
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:22,479
that you were dating the daughter
of comrade Col. Burlacu?

893
01:14:23,522 --> 01:14:26,305
The regiment commander!

894
01:14:29,664 --> 01:14:32,167
Now you're playing dumb?

895
01:14:33,421 --> 01:14:36,603
Haven't I taught you
a soldier must be vigilant?

896
01:14:38,089 --> 01:14:43,030
That he must be wary
of who approaches him

897
01:14:43,435 --> 01:14:47,109
and report anyone suspect?

898
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:48,935
Why don’t you apply?

899
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:53,853
As a soldier,
you can't consort with just anyone.

900
01:14:54,335 --> 01:15:01,793
In wartime, where would you stand
if a female double agent turned your head?

901
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:05,918
Just what the enemy's waiting for:
a weak spot!

902
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:12,325
Can you imagine the mess if
the comrade colonel finds out about this?

903
01:15:12,533 --> 01:15:13,485
Yes.

904
01:15:13,605 --> 01:15:15,627
I don't think you imagine.

905
01:15:16,003 --> 01:15:18,496
The girl's a high school senior.

906
01:15:18,833 --> 01:15:22,800
Her father wants her to go to college.
He pays her private lessons.

907
01:15:22,967 --> 01:15:26,161
And what does she do?
Fools around with my soldiers!

908
01:15:26,746 --> 01:15:29,370
Whose head the shit is going to hit,
in your opinion?

909
01:15:30,557 --> 01:15:31,153
Mine.

910
01:15:31,178 --> 01:15:32,429
Wrong!

911
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,585
Mine, soldier!

912
01:15:35,902 --> 01:15:38,387
I'm the one
they’ll be eating for dinner!

913
01:15:38,412 --> 01:15:42,871
For if, instead of weekend passes,
I'd given you toilet chores,

914
01:15:43,144 --> 01:15:46,703
I'd have avoided trouble
and had cleaner barracks

915
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:54,388
So until discharge, you'd better
stop asking for passes!

916
01:15:59,914 --> 01:16:01,958
Pick up your cap.

917
01:16:04,686 --> 01:16:06,563
Put it on.

918
01:16:09,416 --> 01:16:11,335
Insignia in front.

919
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:17,835
Say, Anghel,

920
01:16:18,919 --> 01:16:20,879
you're a real danger!

921
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:24,715
I'll have to keep my wife
locked inside, from now on.

922
01:16:30,515 --> 01:16:32,328
Beat it!

923
01:17:04,021 --> 01:17:07,405
I bet you were all eager
to have me listen to your records!

924
01:17:26,593 --> 01:17:28,845
So you're picking on our girls, huh?

925
01:17:29,348 --> 01:17:30,832
Do we know each other?

926
01:17:30,876 --> 01:17:33,587
I hope we don't get to!
I won't say more.

927
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:36,121
Want something from me?

928
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:40,418
- Yeah, let that girl alone, she's mine.
- What girl?

929
01:17:40,738 --> 01:17:43,923
You know very well:
the one who just left.

930
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:48,262
- I see you like spying.
- No, but I know she was here.

931
01:17:48,478 --> 01:17:52,715
If we let you
do your service in our town,

932
01:17:52,812 --> 01:17:55,709
does that mean
you can pick on our women?

933
01:17:55,940 --> 01:17:58,066
For the moment,
you're picking on me.

934
01:17:58,297 --> 01:18:00,639
Watch out,
I had 3 years of junior boxing!

935
01:18:00,699 --> 01:18:03,293
Get me sore
and I'll fix your make-up!

936
01:18:03,388 --> 01:18:05,601
Careful, you're speaking
to a soldier in uniform!

937
01:18:05,673 --> 01:18:06,929
You might get in trouble!

938
01:18:07,028 --> 01:18:10,241
I warned you nicely,
from man to man.

939
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:12,523
Perhaps you want to face a patrol?

940
01:18:12,568 --> 01:18:16,278
Perhaps I call my brother who
does karate? There'll be bloodshed.

941
01:18:16,649 --> 01:18:18,303
Perhaps you want a fight?

942
01:18:18,384 --> 01:18:20,903
- I told you nicely!
- You want a fight?

943
01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:22,246
Watch out!

944
01:18:22,396 --> 01:18:23,246
Fight?

945
01:18:23,356 --> 01:18:27,198
If you hit, I'll bust your glasses,
you motherfucker!

946
01:18:27,264 --> 01:18:29,575
Who are you to talk about my mother?

947
01:18:29,624 --> 01:18:33,211
- And who are you to play smart?
- You'll see who I am.

948
01:18:33,287 --> 01:18:37,934
- Why did you hit, huh? Why?
- Who, me?

949
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:41,266
You tried to hit me.
Why did you hit, huh?

950
01:18:41,726 --> 01:18:43,496
Imagine I get angry...

951
01:18:48,795 --> 01:18:52,090
Fuck the sonofbitches Bucharest shit!

952
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:04,572
Stop it!

953
01:19:05,631 --> 01:19:08,865
Sherpeanu, talked in ranks,
you're on the list.

954
01:19:11,254 --> 01:19:15,950
We don't chatter here, we implement
the newspaper-reading program.

955
01:19:19,951 --> 01:19:21,327
Is she coming?

956
01:19:21,586 --> 01:19:23,932
Zamphir? Talked? Written down.

957
01:19:28,114 --> 01:19:31,688
Comrade Corporal, soldier
on report: I smell booze.

958
01:19:32,514 --> 01:19:35,410
Bugiu? Talking out of order.
You're on the list.

959
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,038
I only wanted..

960
01:19:44,069 --> 01:19:45,071
If you'd rather

961
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:49,058
remain in the barracks when
the others leave, fine with me.

962
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:53,898
- It's set? She's coming?
- I'll ask her again tomorrow.

963
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:57,706
Anghel? You're on the note-pad.

964
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:00,825
- Comrade Corporal...
- Silence, soldier! Sit down!

965
01:20:01,259 --> 01:20:03,200
- Why write me down?
- You talked.

966
01:20:03,318 --> 01:20:04,993
You talked, too.

967
01:20:06,266 --> 01:20:08,621
No insolence,
or I'll write you twice!

968
01:20:09,048 --> 01:20:10,880
I don't care, it's unfair.

969
01:20:11,051 --> 01:20:14,430
I can't even read the paper.
you're talking all the time.

970
01:20:15,231 --> 01:20:17,141
I'm writing you down, too.

971
01:20:17,966 --> 01:20:19,496
You what?

972
01:20:20,422 --> 01:20:26,009
"Corporal Puscasu...
talked throughout the program."

973
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:30,215
I’m crazy about Geta.

974
01:20:41,954 --> 01:20:43,618
So, what's the story?

975
01:20:45,659 --> 01:20:49,228
I think she's a little angry.
We're supposed to meet at the theatre.

976
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,320
Really?

977
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:53,043
Horatiu's meeting the chick
at the theatre.

978
01:20:54,948 --> 01:20:56,801
Quiet in the ranks!

979
01:20:57,153 --> 01:20:59,239
Left, right...

980
01:21:00,468 --> 01:21:01,550
Start the tune!

981
01:21:01,575 --> 01:21:04,340
"Proud fatherland, place of heaven..."

982
01:21:04,396 --> 01:21:05,783
Company, repeat!

983
01:21:06,014 --> 01:21:09,656
"Proud fatherland, place of heaven..."

984
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:11,668
Singing, march!

985
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:45,168
Shit, it's her! He wasn't lying.

986
01:21:45,281 --> 01:21:47,141
Hold me tight. I'm shaking.

987
01:21:47,178 --> 01:21:48,512
If they kiss. I shoot myself.

988
01:21:51,056 --> 01:21:53,458
I'll wait for you
at the wagon anyway, around 7.

989
01:21:55,164 --> 01:22:00,339
- How can he afford a fox like that?
- With the dough he makes on our bets.

990
01:22:02,581 --> 01:22:03,886
Anghel!

991
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:07,233
Back to your seat!

992
01:22:37,216 --> 01:22:38,771
He forgot his text?

993
01:22:38,885 --> 01:22:41,438
He's lost. Hey, dick face,
what are you staring at?

994
01:22:42,375 --> 01:22:44,371
He forgot his line.

995
01:22:45,337 --> 01:22:47,320
Cue him, idiots!

996
01:22:50,272 --> 01:22:51,523
He sure took his cue.

997
01:22:53,603 --> 01:22:56,128
Go smash his prothesis,
she'll be impressed.

998
01:22:56,213 --> 01:22:59,653
That's how one loses
both the girl and the bread.

999
01:23:03,705 --> 01:23:05,325
"Dumitru Staroste."

1000
01:23:05,402 --> 01:23:06,861
- What's that?
- That's his name.

1001
01:23:07,624 --> 01:23:10,038
Dress the line!

1002
01:23:12,776 --> 01:23:14,363
Start the tune!

1003
01:23:16,513 --> 01:23:17,606
Company, repeat!

1004
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:24,106
Singing, march!

1005
01:23:26,386 --> 01:23:30,278
"Proud fatherland, place of heaven..."

1006
01:24:07,890 --> 01:24:16,825
"Let us emigrate to America..."

1007
01:24:25,989 --> 01:24:37,175
"If you only knew
how cold it is in Moscow

1008
01:24:37,731 --> 01:24:39,221
This park’s real nice.

1009
01:24:39,465 --> 01:24:41,445
- Is this a compliment for me?
- No, I meant...

1010
01:24:41,551 --> 01:24:45,526
I accept it as a compliment.
The school worked a full month on it.

1011
01:24:45,626 --> 01:24:48,073
Really? Nice job, anyway.

1012
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:50,353
I hate it. Too many settle-downs.

1013
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:55,181
Settle-downs. People who were born
here, work here, make kids here,

1014
01:24:55,288 --> 01:24:57,541
and wait to die here.

1015
01:24:58,306 --> 01:25:00,328
So, what place do you like?

1016
01:25:00,532 --> 01:25:03,481
- The railway station.
- Me. too.

1017
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:08,725
It reminds me that soon,
it's goodbye army, hello, freedom!

1018
01:25:09,732 --> 01:25:12,676
- I'm sick and tired of this uniform.
- So am I.

1019
01:25:13,448 --> 01:25:17,113
- So you’re sick of my uniform?
- You're not the only one in uniform.

1020
01:25:22,938 --> 01:25:26,251
If I could just leave this place,
and go see the world!

1021
01:25:26,377 --> 01:25:29,626
You are leaving.
For Bucharest, for your audition.

1022
01:25:29,723 --> 01:25:32,120
I said "see the world"!

1023
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,353
What's your dearest wish?

1024
01:25:39,739 --> 01:25:42,928
I knew it!
All you can think about is vicious.

1025
01:25:44,433 --> 01:25:46,059
Satisfied?

1026
01:25:46,652 --> 01:25:49,988
- You know what I have in mind.
- You swine! Not before engagement.

1027
01:25:50,075 --> 01:25:52,796
- It's my decision.
- Are we getting engaged?

1028
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,974
I was speaking in general.

1029
01:25:56,138 --> 01:25:58,307
Stop it! It's serious!

1030
01:25:59,887 --> 01:26:02,291
You want to make something
out of your life?

1031
01:26:02,433 --> 01:26:04,011
I don't know...

1032
01:26:05,018 --> 01:26:07,895
Perhaps to make a great discovery...

1033
01:26:08,257 --> 01:26:09,944
Something like Gauss's bell.

1034
01:26:09,982 --> 01:26:12,871
What's that, a buried bell?

1035
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:18,910
Gauss's bell is a diagram,
a mathematical curve.

1036
01:26:19,755 --> 01:26:21,527
Not interesting!

1037
01:26:23,006 --> 01:26:25,519
I think I'd settle for your first wish.

1038
01:28:15,173 --> 01:28:17,511
Carmen, what a surprise!

1039
01:28:20,475 --> 01:28:24,545
- Didn’t Dino come?
- No, why? Was he supposed to?

1040
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:35,193
- Waiting for someone?
- Me? I had a performance.

1041
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:40,208
A girl gave them to me at curtain call
and I've been holding them since.

1042
01:28:48,524 --> 01:28:50,858
Such a romantic setting, right?

1043
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:57,800
Why all this act, Carmen?

1044
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:01,177
I wanted to be sure.

1045
01:29:01,309 --> 01:29:03,679
- Of what?
- Of being two-timed.

1046
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:08,666
That's plain stupid. Sorry.

1047
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:09,896
Really?

1048
01:29:10,251 --> 01:29:12,795
That's how I am, dumb.
not brilliant, like you.

1049
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:14,684
But I'm fed up!

1050
01:29:14,937 --> 01:29:17,931
I'm through
with jerks, artists, conjurors.

1051
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:19,864
I only wanted to see him one last time

1052
01:29:19,889 --> 01:29:23,168
and make him swallow
his lies one by one.

1053
01:29:23,507 --> 01:29:25,942
10 minutes.
the time the train stops by.

1054
01:29:26,407 --> 01:29:28,033
I'm leaving, see?

1055
01:29:29,336 --> 01:29:31,793
A guy's waiting for me
in Bucharest with the papers.

1056
01:29:33,370 --> 01:29:36,852
It's not about love, sugar,
it's about Canada.

1057
01:29:37,248 --> 01:29:39,535
So it's farewell party!

1058
01:29:41,486 --> 01:29:43,942
Not worth it, believe me.

1059
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:46,709
At least somebody loves you here.

1060
01:29:46,826 --> 01:29:49,416
- Some love!
- I didn't mean him.

1061
01:29:53,423 --> 01:29:55,049
What are you doing?

1062
01:29:55,697 --> 01:30:00,671
Screw Canada! Are you crazy?
What do you need Canada for?

1063
01:30:01,272 --> 01:30:06,605
I'll arrange to take you with me
for 10 days to a festival in Bratislava.

1064
01:30:07,621 --> 01:30:10,360
Stop it! Stop!

1065
01:30:11,637 --> 01:30:13,773
Know how long I've waited
for you to be free?

1066
01:30:14,905 --> 01:30:15,874
Don't touch me!

1067
01:30:15,959 --> 01:30:17,770
Hands off, I said!

1068
01:30:17,886 --> 01:30:20,824
He's cheating on you, you know.
At this very moment.

1069
01:30:21,419 --> 01:30:23,337
Let me go or I'll kill you!

1070
01:30:23,428 --> 01:30:27,141
- I'll kill you, miserable bastard!
- Tell me I still got a chance.

1071
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,680
- That's all!
- Stay down!

1072
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:32,116
Stay fucking down!

1073
01:30:34,562 --> 01:30:38,090
I know you want it. Don't be afraid.
We'll love each other madly!

1074
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:40,054
Naked under a fountain
of champagne!

1075
01:30:42,967 --> 01:30:45,888
Wait. I've something to tell you!

1076
01:30:51,941 --> 01:30:55,323
Open up, so I can return your shoe.

1077
01:30:57,742 --> 01:31:00,473
Your husband
makes political jokes on stage

1078
01:31:00,677 --> 01:31:03,387
and you associate
with foreign citizens.

1079
01:31:03,506 --> 01:31:06,098
I'll report on both of you!

1080
01:31:39,091 --> 01:31:41,749
Where were you?
Come have a drink with us.

1081
01:31:41,808 --> 01:31:43,394
We're going home!

1082
01:31:48,869 --> 01:31:52,891
He's completely stoned...
Hey guys. Horatio's been drinking!

1083
01:31:57,254 --> 01:31:58,797
Is he upset?

1084
01:31:58,910 --> 01:32:01,063
Because he lost his dough
That's dumb.

1085
01:32:01,108 --> 01:32:04,099
- No one made him bet.
- What, you sulking?

1086
01:32:04,226 --> 01:32:06,102
It's because his chick didn't come.

1087
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:08,533
Your heart bleeding?

1088
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:10,053
That's women for you.

1089
01:32:10,131 --> 01:32:13,593
If you don't beat the guts out of them
they never understand life.

1090
01:32:13,664 --> 01:32:17,917
I had one before, I caught her
with a restaurant clarinet player.

1091
01:32:18,076 --> 01:32:20,336
I sure made that one sing,
believe me.

1092
01:32:20,778 --> 01:32:23,739
Come on, don't be an asshole.
Tomorrow we are going home.

1093
01:32:23,967 --> 01:32:26,678
Stop it, you morons, he's asleep.

1094
01:32:33,086 --> 01:32:35,171
He must have had a skinful.

1095
01:32:53,108 --> 01:32:56,903
Wake up, your chick's here.

1096
01:32:58,454 --> 01:33:01,750
We'll solve your problem tonight.

1097
01:33:15,091 --> 01:33:17,260
Old buddy, here's the story.

1098
01:33:20,125 --> 01:33:21,964
Pass him the brandy.

1099
01:33:36,803 --> 01:33:42,351
We saw you were in the dumps,
and it's your last night, after all.

1100
01:33:42,573 --> 01:33:46,239
We put up with you for 18 months,
means you're one of us.

1101
01:33:47,067 --> 01:33:53,700
So we took the dough you lost
and invested it to help you.

1102
01:33:54,085 --> 01:33:55,388
You said she's here?

1103
01:33:55,794 --> 01:33:59,546
Before you see what we did for you.

1104
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:02,449
I want to tell you something
on behalf of us all.

1105
01:34:02,793 --> 01:34:08,441
What I want to tell you is:
women are all alike.

1106
01:34:08,863 --> 01:34:10,408
- Right!
- And how!

1107
01:34:10,485 --> 01:34:15,231
What's important for you is
a place you'll find sooner or later.

1108
01:34:15,489 --> 01:34:18,511
The rest is like machine-guns:
only the serial numbers change.

1109
01:34:18,959 --> 01:34:21,169
What matters hitting the bull's-eye.

1110
01:34:24,204 --> 01:34:26,498
I wonder if you read me.

1111
01:34:28,495 --> 01:34:30,288
Take off his glasses.

1112
01:34:50,885 --> 01:34:52,303
Is that him?

1113
01:34:56,251 --> 01:34:57,752
Hi!

1114
01:34:58,652 --> 01:35:00,658
I’m Rexona.

1115
01:35:15,981 --> 01:35:17,606
Nervous?

1116
01:35:18,735 --> 01:35:21,819
You know, it's my first time, too.

1117
01:35:22,828 --> 01:35:24,934
Getting engaged, I mean.

1118
01:35:27,896 --> 01:35:32,836
The guys picked me to talk
because I flunked theology.

1119
01:35:35,213 --> 01:35:38,333
I engage the servant of God Rexona...

1120
01:35:43,283 --> 01:35:45,691
to the servant of God Horatiu.

1121
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:58,176
There were some more words,
but I forgot them.

1122
01:35:59,347 --> 01:36:02,556
Now we will be off
to the washroom so they can...

1123
01:36:03,021 --> 01:36:04,146
You read me.

1124
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:37,606
Can you hear anything?

1125
01:36:52,914 --> 01:36:55,561
- What? You argued?
- Right after engagement?

1126
01:36:55,664 --> 01:36:57,831
Have you got anything
in your pants or not?

1127
01:37:00,454 --> 01:37:02,396
You just lost another bet.

1128
01:37:02,902 --> 01:37:05,143
I can't, it makes no sense.

1129
01:37:09,925 --> 01:37:11,425
Say pal...

1130
01:37:11,577 --> 01:37:13,825
Do you know the saying,
"The smart ones give in first"?

1131
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,790
Not true. Only jerks give in.

1132
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:30,761
5-3-1, put me through to the city.

1133
01:37:47,157 --> 01:37:50,837
Mr. Staroste's room, please.

1134
01:37:54,243 --> 01:38:01,188
Dumitru Staroste? A word of advice:
cool it with that girl.

1135
01:38:01,773 --> 01:38:05,426
Don't try to see her again.
It’s for your own good.

1136
01:38:08,669 --> 01:38:10,813
Hello, Bamboo? Give me Maybug.

1137
01:38:10,889 --> 01:38:12,379
5-3-1, answer me.

1138
01:38:12,581 --> 01:38:15,954
5-3-1, this is Bamboo.
Can you hear me?

1139
01:38:21,883 --> 01:38:25,973
You are going home.
You’re back in civilian clothes.

1140
01:38:26,589 --> 01:38:30,212
But as long as you're
in the regimental area,

1141
01:38:30,489 --> 01:38:36,021
you remain soldiers
and I advise you to behave as such.

1142
01:38:36,373 --> 01:38:39,388
But even outside the barracks gate

1143
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:44,165
in this town,
people know you as soldiers,

1144
01:38:44,856 --> 01:38:48,847
so you'd better behave like soldiers.

1145
01:38:50,074 --> 01:38:52,536
You shall take the train.

1146
01:38:52,857 --> 01:38:57,988
I don't want to hear about
drinking or scandals during the trip.

1147
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:01,404
People must realize you're not
coming out of some low dive.

1148
01:39:01,553 --> 01:39:05,188
Behave as if you were still wearing
the army uniform.

1149
01:39:07,032 --> 01:39:10,620
Even when you get home,
remember one thing:

1150
01:39:10,831 --> 01:39:13,239
before you recover your ID cards,

1151
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:16,466
your service record
is all the ID you have.

1152
01:39:16,565 --> 01:39:20,893
Means that in front of the law.
you are still soldiers

1153
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:26,950
And even after having
officially passed in Reserve

1154
01:39:27,778 --> 01:39:31,778
and started your own personal lives,

1155
01:39:32,272 --> 01:39:37,385
never forget you've done
your military service.

1156
01:39:38,134 --> 01:39:40,469
For people will judge you.
And they must say,

1157
01:39:41,233 --> 01:39:47,058
"Indeed, this is a young man
who has done his stint."

1158
01:39:47,365 --> 01:39:51,715
"We can rely on him
to defend us against the Americans."

1159
01:39:52,458 --> 01:39:58,512
I'll finish by telling you this:
you were born civilians,

1160
01:39:59,664 --> 01:40:05,349
but you'll remain all your life
soldiers of the Romanian Army Reserve!

1161
01:40:05,944 --> 01:40:07,110
Congratulations!

1162
01:40:07,352 --> 01:40:08,668
We serve the Fatherland!

1163
01:40:08,726 --> 01:40:10,451
Company, attention!

1164
01:40:10,576 --> 01:40:12,201
Pick up suitcases.

1165
01:40:13,105 --> 01:40:14,397
Quarter turn, right!

1166
01:40:15,934 --> 01:40:18,041
To the gate, forward, march!

1167
01:40:29,928 --> 01:40:32,637
I'll look for her at school
so she sees me in civies,

1168
01:40:32,966 --> 01:40:34,218
I’ll give her one more chance.

1169
01:41:27,999 --> 01:41:29,079
Start the tune!

1170
01:41:29,182 --> 01:41:32,165
"Proud fatherland, place of heaven..."

1171
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:34,580
Company, repeat!

1172
01:41:38,739 --> 01:41:41,259
Company, repeat!

1173
01:41:46,876 --> 01:41:48,768
Company!
