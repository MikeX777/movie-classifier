1
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:08,150
A picturesque region in the Balkans
packed with strange customs

2
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:11,174
birds eat with spoons

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,620
horses go bathing and a big
mouth go swimming in the woods

4
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:23,664
in the middle of Croatia there
is an abundance of water

5
00:00:23,688 --> 00:00:28,408
the unpredictable waters of
the Sava know no restrictions

6
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,112
and create an amphibian world

7
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:38,300
flooded for months at a time the wetlands
are home to swarms of young creatures

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,300
like the ugly ducklings

9
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:46,124
piggyback chicks and builders
busy grooming themselves

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,220
in the floodplains large birds catch
fish and large fish catch bird

11
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:04,630
here people live with the water as was usual
in many parts of Europe centuries ago

12
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,250
at a time when rivers could meander
as they pleased

13
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:18,450
an ancient cultural landscape in which many
domesticated animals can wander freely all year round

14
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,260
like the deer in the forests
and the beavers in the water

15
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:31,449
that landscape shows us today
what flood protection can mean

16
00:01:31,473 --> 00:01:33,473
[music]

17
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,219
the most plentiful tributary of the Danube

18
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,262
has its headwaters in the julian alps of Slovenia

19
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:07,599
fed from glaciers snow and ice one of its stems has
its source in the foothills of Mount Airy Bluff

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:18,068
this is where the Sava river begins its
over 940 kilometer journey

21
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:30,570
emerald-green Springs produce crystal-clear
groundwater like miniature volcanoes

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,200
before it got this far it trickled down
underground through the mountains

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,420
it's still winter up here
everything is sheathed in ice

24
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:56,464
even lake behind where the two stems of the
Sava join forces still has a coating of ice

25
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:04,370
from here the Sava continues as a tumbling mountain
torrent towards the Danube and the Black Sea

26
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:15,840
to save energy in this gushing River the trout
and speckled trout aim into the current

27
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,430
despite the bitter cold of the winter
many parts of the Sava remain ice-free

28
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,690
where he becomes shallower it freezes
over from the banks towards the center

29
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:46,160
but the fast flowing current will not permit
the ice to cover the surface completely

30
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,760
mountain streams like this are the preferred
hunting ground of a rather special bird

31
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:03,640
the white throated dipper relies on the streams
not freezing over completely in the winter

32
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,660
it doesn't just dip its head into the water
to hunt for amphipods or insect larvae

33
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:22,120
the Dipper is the only songbird that can
swim and can dive for up to 30 seconds

34
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,319
it even takes a dive into the gushing Sava

35
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:42,643
where a Danube salmon has already caught its
lunch but is having difficulty swallowing it

36
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:51,980
there was a time when this predatory fish that grows up to 1.8
metres in length was ubiquitous throughout the Danube area

37
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:54,559
today the Danube salmon is less frequent

38
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,369
it needs fast flowing well oxygenated
rivers with plenty of gravel to breed in

39
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:06,422
in many places those rivers have been
dammed with barges and lock systems

40
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:12,533
this is why the untamed Sava is a
crucial retreat for the Danube salmon

41
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,309
the Sava is still passing through
mountainous country but soon the

42
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,599
gradient becomes less obvious and the
river completely changes its character

43
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:32,240
as it passes through Slovenia Croatia
Bosnia Herzegovina and Serbia

44
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,638
the lively mountain stream from the
eastern Alps becomes a leisurely

45
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,739
meandering river that joins
the Danube at Belgrade

46
00:05:40,763 --> 00:05:47,310
halfway along southeast of Zagreb it snakes through
flat plans with only the slightest gradient

47
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:52,210
here in plaza vena lies the
long scope olia nature reserves

48
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,299
in one of the last contiguous
River landscapes in Europe

49
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:11,429
in the cold winter many of the side arms of the
sava wetlands are frozen to a large extent

50
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:24,090
in the Balkans the summer is much warmer than in
Central Europe but the winter can be very hard

51
00:06:25,414 --> 00:06:30,634
there are not many sections of this tranquil
stretch of water that stay free of ice

52
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:42,200
they're only superficially frozen and
many of the fish spend the winter here

53
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:51,810
as do the great white heron they may look exotic but
they can deal with extremely frosty temperatures

54
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:57,680
since they don't only live off fish they don't
have to migrate when the waters freeze over

55
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,110
they find enough mice and other
small animals under the snow

56
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,510
and this fox is hoping his luck ease in today

57
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,810
the open sections of the Sava are
a center of attraction for many

58
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:31,340
mute swans the largest waterfowl in
Europe get social during the winter

59
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,190
sometimes dozens of them will congregate
around the unfrozen arms of the river

60
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:53,190
in places like this no movement in the water
will go unnoticed by the white and grey herons

61
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,659
after all it might be a fish and in these
temperatures every calorie is precious

62
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,420
and worth an argument

63
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,280
and this wild boar does not want to be left out

64
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,850
so he goes over to sort the herons out

65
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:36,160
and disappears into the extensive
forests of the Sava wetlands

66
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:43,129
the Nature Reserve is not only
home to centuries-old Slavonia oak

67
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,950
whose particularly durable wood is highly
sought-after for furniture and wine barrels

68
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,970
it's also where the best ham is
domiciled so the saying goes

69
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,443
the winter resistant Europe olia pigs with
their layer of fat up to 15 centimetres thick

70
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:09,880
live here all year round and root
around in the woods looking for acorns

71
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:18,410
during the Balkan war at the beginning of the 1990s
this ancient species of animal was nearly made extinct

72
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:27,220
but the robust original Europe aalia's are an
essential source of genetic material for pig breeding

73
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,930
fortunately it was possible to save them

74
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,180
and with them the traditional
grassland farming by the sava

75
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,540
an ancient cultural bio diverse landscape

76
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,760
artificial canals cut their
way through the wetlands

77
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:54,592
but the neatly felled trees
were not the work of humans

78
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,200
fresh tracks indicate that they're
still active even in the cold season

79
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:08,390
beavers do not hibernate these large
rodents have to eat regularly

80
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,290
they've stocked their underwater
ladders for difficult times

81
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,459
but wherever possible they prefer to
save their energy and eat fresh bark

82
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,380
even if the way to the next
snack is a little slippery

83
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,610
even the Magpies cantake a slide

84
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:44,934
now that it's slowly beginning to thaw some
small tip bits are becoming accessible

85
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:53,460
the great bitten likes to stalk along the edge of the reeds where
there are often breaks in the ice looking for unmoving fish

86
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:01,333
while Magpies as omnivores can survive in the
cold season by feeding on vegetarian meals

87
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,690
the great bitten needs its meat licious

88
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:15,434
then spring comes and in the julian alps where
the Sava has its source everything is thawing

89
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:20,950
water from the massive catchment
area tumbles over the cliffs

90
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,750
one great torrent is making its way

91
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:31,119
in the plaza vena plain the water masses build
up the entire Sava basin fills up sometimes as

92
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,120
much as 10 metres above the normal level

93
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:41,849
although it looks like a natural disaster this is actually
saving the towns along the Sava from urban flooding

94
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:50,079
the Sava wetlands act as a detention basin over
600 square kilometres is flooded every year

95
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:01,870
like an enormous sponge the alluvial forests soak
up the water from around 10 billion bathtubs

96
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:06,890
in the past many River landscapes
around Europe looked like this

97
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,460
these trees often spend several weeks
and months standing in the water

98
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:20,860
without these floodplains towns like Zagreb
and Belgrade would frequently be washed out

99
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,630
many animals benefit from the flooding

100
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:30,850
no less than 15 species of
amphibians like the moor frog

101
00:12:32,074 --> 00:12:37,580
these 7 centimeter long frogs leave their
winter quarters on mass in the spring

102
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:42,278
and for the spawning season the
male's take on a blue color

103
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:48,202
these flooded meadows provide plenty of food

104
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,846
herons fish while beside them

105
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,620
the wild boar graze on
fresh greens in the water

106
00:12:56,644 --> 00:13:00,644
or dig in the soggy soil for
insect larvae and roots

107
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,420
even the torah' polio
pigs wade in the marsh

108
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,480
with their powerful snouts
they plow the river landscape

109
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:26,824
they're digging action breaks up the heavy soil allowing
fresh grass to establish itself in the nutrient-rich mud

110
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,670
by maintaining this traditional
meadow management system

111
00:13:33,694 --> 00:13:40,694
the inhabitants of the Sava region have found a way of
making the most of the wetlands despite regular flooding

112
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,000
they live with the water rather
than fighting against it

113
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,270
since the level can rise by 10 metres
overnight the houses are built on embankment

114
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:56,653
and usually 2 storeys high when the floods
come the inhabitants move up to the top floods

115
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,630
the Chi got village has 70 timber houses

116
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:06,879
and used to be home to 300 people there
are now only a hundred and twenty

117
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:14,489
but they have sub-tenants there are over
40 pairs of storks nesting on the roofs

118
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,490
g-gosh was christened Europe's first stork village

119
00:14:21,214 --> 00:14:28,234
the inhabitants support the storks and provide
platforms for them to build their nests on

120
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,479
the alluvial forests are a plentiful
source of nest building materials

121
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:43,100
a stork's nest can have a diameter of 2 meters
many are the work of successive stork generations

122
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:50,570
when the partner returns carrying building materials
he or she is greeted with bill clattering

123
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,530
the nest is also the mating location
a balancing act high up on the roof

124
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:09,040
while the storks actively seek human
habitations to build their nests

125
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,990
others prefer the privacy of the alluvial forest

126
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:21,937
after the winter the mute swans
give up their social gatherings

127
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:28,232
they're strict vegetarians and
mainly live off aquatic vegetation

128
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,183
but when a pair start
exchanging aquatic undergrowth

129
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:40,349
they're collecting building materials
branches and twigs form the base construction

130
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:48,919
the greenery is for the padding
the swan couples like to build

131
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:54,238
their nests that are big enough for five
to seven eggs on small islands away from

132
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:57,459
the banks to prevent the Foxes getting close

133
00:16:00,483 --> 00:16:07,519
the crested grebe have already laid their eggs in the
floating nest made of reeds branches and water plants

134
00:16:09,499 --> 00:16:17,119
as underwater hunters they catch small fish
interspersed with aquatic insects and crayfish

135
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:29,029
this one has caught a
particularly bulky specimen

136
00:16:32,553 --> 00:16:39,173
swallowing this large crayfish with its hard
shell and cumbersome pincers is quite a feat

137
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,620
once dinner is over the grebe
has to preen itself thoroughly

138
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:05,247
what looks like a heap of old sticks dumped in the
forest is in fact an architectural masterpiece

139
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,950
beavers build dams to
maintain a steady water level

140
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:17,119
the entrance to their Lodge is under
water to keep out land-based predators

141
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,178
they may not look very graceful a beaver
can weigh up to 40 kilograms which is

142
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:28,499
heavier than a roe deer but underwater
they cut a very streamlined figure

143
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:36,830
they propel themselves forwards with their
hind feet the scaly tail acts as a rudder

144
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,799
the beaver will gnaw at a large tree for
several days

145
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:02,479
once the tree has been felled that will
gorge themselves on the juicy leaves and

146
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,880
buds from the crown of the tree

147
00:18:06,604 --> 00:18:14,269
thinner twigs up to the thickness of a pencil that's still
very soft are eaten completely with the wood and bark

148
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:19,270
many of the felled trees will
sprout again the next year

149
00:18:19,294 --> 00:18:25,504
the larger branches are only used as
building materials for the lodge and Dam

150
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:36,610
this is what causes beaver Lakes
with constant water levels

151
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:42,519
these permanent water features created by beavers
are extremely important for the plants and

152
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,920
animals in the alluvial forests

153
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:52,864
the European pond turtle for example one of
12 reptile species in the Nature Reserve

154
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:58,710
these turtles prefer thick underwater
vegetation with muddy sediment

155
00:18:58,934 --> 00:19:04,874
they usually mate in the water on dry
land it can be a risky affair

156
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:10,918
in summer beavers will mainly
eat juicy green vegetation

157
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,430
fresh herbs and foliage
buds and water lily roots

158
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:20,714
they generally only live off tree bark
in the winter when there's nothing else

159
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:27,811
a fully grown beaver needs a kilogram
of fresh vegetable matter every day

160
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:34,535
when they dive they can stay
underwater for a quarter of an hour

161
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:43,400
their nose and ears are closed off they can see because
their eyes are protected by an additional transparent skin

162
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,930
the lodge has now seen
the arrival of the kids

163
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:11,779
between April and June the female will give birth
to one to four kids with hair and their eyes open

164
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,990
the young spend the first month in
the living quarters of the lodge

165
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,000
for six to eight weeks they're subtle by the mother

166
00:20:24,024 --> 00:20:27,234
as long as the kids are in the lodge they're safe

167
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:39,670
but out in the waters of the sava
terrifying predators are waiting

168
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:49,918
catfish can grow to 100 1/2 meters long
and weigh more than 50 kilograms

169
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,969
some have even been known to grow to three
metres in length and reach weights of

170
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,690
over a hundred and fifty kilogram

171
00:20:57,314 --> 00:21:01,904
the sava wetlands are home to one of the
largest catfish populations in Europe

172
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,229
they're usually loners

173
00:21:09,553 --> 00:21:13,913
but in spring there are
sometimes unusual gatherings

174
00:21:16,037 --> 00:21:22,719
the focus is usually a group of overweight
females with swollen bellies full of spawn

175
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,590
a large female can lay up
to half a million tiny eggs

176
00:21:37,514 --> 00:21:44,694
and yet these whirling catfish are not mating this
puzzling spectacle is perhaps a kind of foreplay

177
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:56,009
the mating act takes place only between
two catfish in private after the male

178
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,599
has created a spawning burrow in the
shallow water close to the bank

179
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,010
among thick underwater vegetation

180
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:16,729
there are many suitable places along the
sava the quiet side arms are often

181
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,740
overgrown with a thick mat
of pond and water lilies

182
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,730
they're juicy branches are nourishing
tidbits for the Beavers

183
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:46,500
and the broad floating leaves are a welcome
diving board for France hunting insects

184
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:59,190
in this way the Fertile waters of the wetlands are a
good source of food for many species and a nursery

185
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:05,134
one of the most common fish in the
Sava is not even from this area

186
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:13,900
in the densely vegetated shoreline pumpkinseed fish with
their black mark on the gill cover have found a hole

187
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,570
at the end of the 19th century the fish was
introduced in Europe from North America

188
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:27,329
and escaped from some garden ponds since it
breeds several times a year it was able to spread

189
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,630
rapidly across the continent

190
00:23:31,254 --> 00:23:35,614
the pumpkinseed protects its
spawning burrows aggressively

191
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:43,038
it will even attack very large intruders

192
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:54,990
one level higher another baby has
just freed itself of its eggshell

193
00:23:55,514 --> 00:24:01,654
stripe iya squeakers or baby boars its
siblings already swimming around the nest

194
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:11,390
the chicks of the crested grebe do not all
hatch out at the same time but a day apart

195
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,710
surprisingly the parents offer
their babies freshly pulled feathers

196
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,820
even order the chicks eat them

197
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:38,169
one explanation might be this it's
possible that the feathers protect the

198
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:42,890
tender stomach linings of the babies
against sharp fish bones

199
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:59,049
the first weeks the chicks spend a lot
of time in a cozy hollow of warm down

200
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:03,990
this protects them against the cold
water and the hot Sun

201
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:14,649
frequently the parents will go swimming
with the chicks on their banks

202
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:18,759
and they have even been known to dive with

203
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:24,910
but this grebe is just looking for a
more comfortable position on the nest

204
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:33,040
in their piggy back position the chicks are relatively
safe from predators in the air and in the water

205
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,409
the sava wetlands offer many different
possibilities for undisturbed nesting

206
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:49,450
some build floating nests where
they can bring up their young

207
00:25:52,850 --> 00:26:00,850
another crested species the hoop hole find safe
breeding in tree hollows in the oak forests

208
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:09,002
here the young wait for their parents who take turns to
bring food mainly crickets beetles and larger caterpillars

209
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:21,270
in the alluvial forests the penduline tit hangs its nest from
a branch to build the nest it uses fine vegetable fibers

210
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:24,275
sometimes even spider's webs

211
00:26:24,699 --> 00:26:29,189
the soft pouches used to be collected
for use as children's slippers

212
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,510
the who posed nest is now
attracting unwanted attention

213
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,470
there are strange noises in the hollow

214
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:49,509
a Starling is intent on stealing nesting material
and the Hoopoe keeps well out of the way

215
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,680
discretion is the better part of valor

216
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:06,450
but what does the Starling really want it
flies off without the nesting material

217
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:13,010
so the Hooper parents can carry
on with feeding their young in peace

218
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:31,226
two-thirds of the landscape olio Nature
Reserve is covered with alluvial forests

219
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:41,269
one third is wet meadowland which provides the
storks with a well-stocked larder to choose from

220
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:48,653
every adults talk requires a pound of food a
day and the chicks need more than twice that

221
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:53,849
so store parents have to transport
several kilograms of food every day

222
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:01,040
they poke around in the grass to find insects
and mice amphibians slugs and earthworms

223
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:09,400
if the meadows are under water they
catch crayfish and small fish their

224
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:17,600
stalks are characteristic of the Nature Reserve
there are over 700 pairs breeding here

225
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,619
they're constantly
repairing their nests this means they

226
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:28,029
can grow over the years to 4 metres in
height and can weigh up to 600 kilograms

227
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:33,230
after over a month of incubation the
young storks have hatched

228
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:38,380
at the beginning one of the parents will
always stay with the nest provide shade and

229
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,960
regurgitate tidbits for the clamoring babies

230
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,440
everywhere in the wetlands
there are newborn babies

231
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,862
after a good five weeks of incubation
the mute swan cygnets have hatched

232
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,930
in their grayish white plumage
they're anything but ugly ducklings

233
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,480
they preen themselves in the water

234
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:34,704
hands together with their parents in the nest

235
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:43,050
the swans distribute oil from their
preen gland all over their plumage

236
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,680
to make every single feather waterproof

237
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,070
soon after hatching the cygnets are expected
to find their own food in the water

238
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:59,054
the parents were there longer necks may
be able to reach deeper into the water

239
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:17,649
but that doesn't mean they're going
to give away any of their lunch

240
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:27,120
the wetlands are fertile along the banks of
the snaking Sava river there are cormorants

241
00:30:27,579 --> 00:30:29,579
the water is teeming with fish

242
00:30:34,603 --> 00:30:38,603
the larger catfish have retreated to quieter regions

243
00:30:40,027 --> 00:30:44,127
the younger catfish are swarming
in the open water like tadpoles

244
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:47,219
catching amphipods and insect larvae

245
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:55,070
this way they confuse fish predators that
have to be able to concentrate on one target

246
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,430
there are predators hiding
everywhere in the wetlands

247
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:11,620
like this spotted eagle
that's just grabbing a pumpkin seed fish

248
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:27,350
the noisy cormorant colony where the birds brood
together high in the trees can be heard from a distance

249
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:35,460
the older fledglings extract their lunches
from deep inside their parents throat pouch

250
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,440
if it's very hot the parents also give them water

251
00:31:53,464 --> 00:31:57,926
the diverse bird life in the
wetlands can't be taken for granted

252
00:31:57,928 --> 00:32:00,428
the fine balance can easily be disturbed

253
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,880
this can be seen from the
crappier doll side arm

254
00:32:07,004 --> 00:32:11,364
where grey heron and
spoonbills breed side by side

255
00:32:15,188 --> 00:32:20,188
the heron are frequently seen in
Europe and even nest in large towns

256
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:27,932
the more rare spoonbills however
only frequent intact wetlands

257
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:38,500
at the end of the 1980s this sidearm was
drained and the spoonbills disappeared

258
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:44,520
fortunately there are now 120 pairs
here reading beside the herons

259
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,890
after the sidearm was returned to its natural
state the spoonbills returned within two years

260
00:32:56,896 --> 00:33:00,656
and are now bringing up their
young again in this joint colony

261
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:05,350
and even the young have a spoon shaped bill

262
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:21,450
today attends of all the spoonbills in
Europe breed in crappy Adal

263
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:34,533
this is why the bird with the strange shaped beak
was honored as the symbol of the Nature Reserve

264
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,610
in the slit of the sidearm there are
other birds with odd-looking beaks

265
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,510
the Bill of the pied Avocet
bends upwards towards the tip

266
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:05,809
while the spoon bill uses its extremely
sensitive bill to search the riverbed

267
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,668
for aquatic insects crayfish and clams

268
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:15,302
the Avocet sifts for small
animals in the shallow silt

269
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:27,146
even the young chicks emulate this
my swing their heads to detect prey

270
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,880
since their tools dictate the way
they search and what they find

271
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,990
they do not infringe on each other's
territory in the crocodile sidearms

272
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,483
we're into midsummer in the wetlands

273
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:12,507
and the entire beaver family
has taken to the water

274
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:19,310
the youngsters are still a little
apprehensive about the water

275
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,829
and have to be encouraged to swim or are
even carried by the bank an adult and a

276
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:31,409
juvenile from last year are combing
their fur using the special combing claw

277
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:36,040
on their hind feet and applying oil to
making waterproof

278
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:47,453
they tend to spend several hours a day in the
water on average and can't afford to catch cold

279
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,869
on average the sava wetlands are flooded
for 32 a hundred days a year

280
00:35:55,870 --> 00:36:02,900
it's not only in spring but in any month of the year
that powerful rainfall can cause it to burst its banks

281
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,440
and generate fertile habitats for many creatures

282
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:15,710
including the Osprey although it only weighs one other
half kilos is able to catch fish weighing two kilograms

283
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,740
after locating them with its eagle eyes from afar

284
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,080
and picking them out of the water

285
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:31,324
in the sava wetlands with their

286
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:37,350
plentiful supplies of fish the Eagles also have
ideal locations for their IRA's in the tall trees

287
00:36:38,374 --> 00:36:43,964
normally they produce two to three chicks
these youngsters are already a few weeks old

288
00:36:45,025 --> 00:36:48,845
allowing both the parents
to leave the nest regularly

289
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,680
to bring home enough food
for the family

290
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,029
the labyrinthine waters of the wetlands
are often murky so not all the fish

291
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,740
hunters need to have such good eyes as
the Eagles that hum from high in the sky

292
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:20,446
the large catfish have relatively poor
eyesight but their whole body and in

293
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,170
particular their long feelers is
covered with sensitive sense organs

294
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:31,150
this allows them to notice quickly in
the muddy sediment of the sidearms

295
00:37:31,174 --> 00:37:35,434
if a competitor has already
staked out a good hunting ground

296
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:44,088
with their large mouths catfish can
catch not only fish and crayfish

297
00:37:45,612 --> 00:37:53,372
their hearing is so sensitive that they can detect vibrations
outside the water and go to check out the hunting options

298
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:59,720
in the flooded alluvial forests the catfish
is looking for a particular hunting ground

299
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:13,930
there are reports of small dogs ending
up inside the jaws of the catfish

300
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,740
this is where pigeons come
down to the water to drink

301
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,490
they're flapping wings are a giveaway

302
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,580
that attacked was a failure

303
00:38:29,604 --> 00:38:35,280
the pigeons are wary and don't allow themselves
to be dragged into the water that easily

304
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,730
they're still thirsty though and come back

305
00:38:47,454 --> 00:38:49,974
a new opportunity for the catfish

306
00:38:52,508 --> 00:38:54,508
the pigeons are forewarned

307
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:00,500
for they keep coming back

308
00:39:04,524 --> 00:39:07,524
the third attack is a success

309
00:39:09,248 --> 00:39:12,449
in the summer The Meadows are a blaze of red

310
00:39:13,573 --> 00:39:17,633
a sea of poppies growing in
a field near the village

311
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:22,217
in agriculture in the Sava wetlands
the emphasis is on livestock breeding

312
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,940
but in some places arable
farming is also possible

313
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,914
peppers and sweet corn cobs
dry outside the houses

314
00:39:29,938 --> 00:39:31,938
as they have done for hundreds of years

315
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,980
there's twittering coming from the
rafters Housemartins

316
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:46,880
in the protected environment of old
houses we find a whole colony

317
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,310
some of the Housemartins have
been here twice this summer

318
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:58,150
the others still have
to complete their nests

319
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:04,219
they build the walls of their nests
from inside using moist lumps of earth

320
00:40:04,243 --> 00:40:06,873
until there is only their front door left open

321
00:40:10,019 --> 00:40:14,479
there's a plethora of building
materials in the Sarver wetlands

322
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:23,979
thanks to the moist surroundings these Martens can
always find lumps beside puddles and on the banks of the

323
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,190
waters even in the hottest summer

324
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:35,242
it takes around a fourth life to build a nest

325
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:40,326
and then they lay up to five eggs in it

326
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,650
and up in the loft there's
a lively commotion

327
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:56,275
the mouse eared bats spend the
daylight hours up here squeaking

328
00:40:56,299 --> 00:41:01,338
most of these are females and they will give
birth to their young here and bring them up

329
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:08,602
hundreds sometimes even thousands
of bats vie for the best places

330
00:41:14,426 --> 00:41:16,106
holding on tight with their claws

331
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,670
they spend the day hanging upside
down under the wooden roof

332
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:25,589
there will swarm out after darkness
falls and go searching for food

333
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:36,040
thanks to their large ears they can locate
their prey in the dark by ultrasound

334
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:39,239
mainly all manner of insects

335
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:46,399
in these moist weapons there are many
different midges and flies moths and beetles

336
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:54,800
the floodplains of the sava are of importance
to the protection of birds throughout Europe

337
00:41:57,019 --> 00:42:03,599
on the one hand they're the breeding area for
over a hundred and forty different bird species

338
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:10,660
numerous waterfowl like the snipe nest
in these moist meadows

339
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:21,730
but for migrating birds to the sava wetlands are one
of the most important rest areas on the continent

340
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:30,420
here they can plan a stopover to
recover from their long flights

341
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:33,199
and eat to their heart's content

342
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:44,577
all-in-all no less than 240 bird species
have been registered in the Nature Reserve

343
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,620
including the curl you

344
00:42:54,144 --> 00:43:00,984
where the syrup olia pigs plow up the
sava mud in spring we now get fresh grass

345
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,492
a great benefit to the
powerful paws of inna horses

346
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:11,220
with their broad hooves they have no
difficulty walking over the soften ground

347
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,540
in the summer they like to enjoy
a cooling bath in the sava

348
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:23,000
since the start of spring the horses have lived
here without any human influence in the wetlands

349
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,960
with their fluctuating water levels

350
00:43:29,784 --> 00:43:33,234
this is the ideal environment
for grass snakes

351
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:37,809
that can hunt mainly toads and
amphibians in the moist surroundings

352
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,740
the snake could hardly catch
healthy fish in the river

353
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,569
but when the water recedes from the
flooded Meadows the fish left behind in

354
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,650
the puddles virtually leaps straight
into the grass snakes mouth

355
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:15,060
this easy to catch prey also attracts stalks
onto the moist meadows and pasture land

356
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:20,044
they pick the juiciest insects

357
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:32,280
often they will follow the cattle on horses because as they move
around grazing they dislodge grasshoppers and other creatures

358
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:41,650
the storks benefit from these free roaming
domesticated animals in many ways

359
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,930
if there were no horses or cattle
here there will be fewer storks

360
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:59,272
on the one hand puddles of this
kind are maintained by them

361
00:45:00,009 --> 00:45:05,989
because horses and other livestock wallow
in them and keep the muddy areas open

362
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:15,160
the sava wetlands though a considerable degree of their
diversity to the hungry stomachs of these large herbivores

363
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,840
without the help of these
natural mowing machines

364
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:23,480
the damp pastures would soon
degenerate into closed oak forests

365
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:32,530
this traditional pasture farming keeps
the ancient cultural landscape alive

366
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:39,659
and encourages Himura files like the stork to
breed here in large numbers

367
00:45:39,709 --> 00:45:44,620
by the end of the summer there are more
storks living in g-gosh than people

368
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:49,598
in many nests for chicks are
produced sometimes even 6

369
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,290
when it's really hot the parents will dribble water
from their beaks into those of the chicks

370
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,960
and eating grass snakes find their
way from the swamp to the nest

371
00:46:00,509 --> 00:46:04,099
and from there into a storks stomach

372
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:14,990
in the late summer early morning miss
rise over the Nature Reserve

373
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,570
a melancholy idle

374
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:29,804
when the sava wetlands of Croatia remind us
of paintings by famous landscape artists

375
00:46:44,629 --> 00:46:51,739
and that is no coincidence because large
regions of Europe used to look like this

376
00:46:52,539 --> 00:46:56,629
before the rivers were forced to behave
and flooding was normal

377
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:09,150
times when all over the continent riparian
wetlands could only be used naturally for grazing

378
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:17,668
this created landscape diversity has
still seen in the landscape olia puddles

379
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:19,709
and pools on moist meadows

380
00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:31,309
mocchi sidearms and river meanders

381
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,190
traditional woodland and pasture

382
00:47:41,514 --> 00:47:48,224
while the paws Avena horses spend their winter in
their stables the pigs stay outside all year round

383
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:54,980
in the autumn they're driven into the
woods where they mainly eat acorns

384
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:03,390
these woodland pastures keep the
forests open and free of undergrowth

385
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,690
and that produces park-like landscapes in the wetlands

386
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,770
when autumn arrives there's a
lot of action to see and here

387
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:32,550
during the last warm days of the year the squirrels
and foxes build up their layers of winter fat

388
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:38,270
and in the country by the sava
the Red Deer are heard bellowing

389
00:48:42,799 --> 00:48:48,609
those from the posavina region are
some of the strongest in Europe

390
00:48:53,419 --> 00:48:57,989
the most important time of the year is
fast approaching the rutting season

391
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:13,430
attracted by the bellowing of the stags the
Hinds gather at the traditional meeting points

392
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,920
these are usually spaces
that have not grown over

393
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,179
the Stags need open spaces to give
them room to impress the Highlands

394
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:47,579
and intimidate their rivals

395
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:55,930
the last big wetland area in Europe

396
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:02,950
is still a coherent mix of river and
flooding managed pasture and diverse nature

397
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,520
it's like looking into the past of our continent

398
00:50:06,544 --> 00:50:12,634
that shows us how natural flood protection
for large towns and cities can be

399
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:17,340
as in the sava wetlands of Croatia

400
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:21,364
[music]

401
00:50:29,388 --> 00:50:31,388
[music]
