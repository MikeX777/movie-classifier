00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:38,192
Bad dreams?

3
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,465
You could say that.

4
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,770
Well, it's not much
but it... it's getting there.

5
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:24,604
You know,
your father has worked really...

6
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:29,744
- hard the last couple of weeks.
- It looks like a haunted house.

7
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:34,181
- Is it haunted, Mom?
- No, honey, it's not haunted.

8
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:36,583
Oh, there he is.

9
00:04:37,518 --> 00:04:39,585
Your father really
has worked hard the last couple

10
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:42,023
of weeks, Rachel, so please
show a little appreciation.

11
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:07,078
- Hey, sport.
- Dad, I want to see my room.

12
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,182
Upstairs.

13
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:11,117
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

14
00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:14,756
- How is she?
- Mm, I think she'll come around.

15
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:29,569
- Hey, Rach.
- Hi, Dad.

16
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,809
- How was the drive?
- It was okay.

17
00:05:35,075 --> 00:05:38,143
Well, this is the house... um...

18
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:40,078
I grew up running up and down
those stairs.

19
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,917
Actually I'm kinda tired.
I just wanna go to my room.

20
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:49,624
Yeah, sure. Uh, it's upstairs.
It's the best room upstairs.

21
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,158
Don't tell your mother
I said that.

22
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,229
All right. Thanks, Dad.

23
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:04,773
Everything's gonna change now.

24
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,054
I found that in the attic.

25
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:55,353
Lots of memories up there.

26
00:06:55,355 --> 00:06:57,924
- You scared me.
- Huh, sorry.

27
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:02,029
- Can I have this?
- Yeah, of course.

28
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,963
Your grandmother would have
wanted you to have it.

29
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,698
Oh. I mean... Well, I don't have
to take it if he wants...

30
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,903
No, no, it's yours.

31
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,475
- Okay... thanks.
- Hmm.

32
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,412
Hey, no balls
in the house.

33
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:23,148
- No balls?
- No balls.

34
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,352
Well... what about deez nuts?

35
00:07:26,354 --> 00:07:28,156
Outside!

36
00:07:32,359 --> 00:07:34,059
That's your boy,
that's your boy.

37
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:35,397
Yeah.

38
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:18,333
<i>Rachel.</i>

39
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,102
<i>Rachel.</i>

40
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,506
We are ready for you.

41
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:29,277
Okay.

42
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:39,152
Okay, this is the part
that pertains to you...

43
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:40,953
your daughter.

44
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,121
"It is my wish
to leave my estate,

45
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:45,857
which includes my house
and all its contents,

46
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:48,595
to my granddaughter,
Rachel Dunn.

47
00:09:50,031 --> 00:09:52,930
The remainder of my estate
will be put into a trust

48
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:57,004
and also awarded to Rachel
on her 21st birthday."

49
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:03,008
I... I don't understand.

50
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,513
So there's nothing
for her... her only child?

51
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:09,617
Sarah.

52
00:10:14,754 --> 00:10:16,290
She also left this
for you.

53
00:10:24,297 --> 00:10:28,635
Now, there's a special
contingency I must read you.

54
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,606
"As long as Rachel lives
in the Dunn house,

55
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,907
she will not have to pay
for the house, taxes, utilities

56
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:38,711
or any expenses associated
with the property

57
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:40,848
as they will be paid
by the estate.

58
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:45,049
However, if she chooses not
to reside in the property,

59
00:10:45,051 --> 00:10:47,652
then the entire estate
will be liquidated

60
00:10:47,654 --> 00:10:49,655
and all proceeds donated

61
00:10:49,657 --> 00:10:52,259
to the charities
I have listed below."

62
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,131
Then the list of charity
organizations goes on.

63
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,469
Mom... why would she leave
the house to me?

64
00:11:03,637 --> 00:11:07,272
Ms. Dunn, uh...
she was an eccentric lady,

65
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:10,442
but these instructions are
to be followed.

66
00:11:10,444 --> 00:11:12,343
She was very clear on that.

67
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:14,414
But I grew up in the house.

68
00:11:15,148 --> 00:11:17,152
Why would she not leave me
anything?

69
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:21,355
She's trying to get back at me
for moving so far away from her.

70
00:11:22,388 --> 00:11:23,490
Right?

71
00:11:50,017 --> 00:11:52,720
- Andy!
- <i>Sorry!</i>

72
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,834
Thanks.

73
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,705
- Did you finish unpacking?
- Uh, almost.

74
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,240
- Looks good, honey.
- Thank you,

75
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:17,175
I thought,
our first official dinner

76
00:12:17,177 --> 00:12:19,580
in this house, I would try
to do something special.

77
00:12:19,846 --> 00:12:21,179
Andy, get your elbows
off the table.

78
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:23,850
And sit up straight.

79
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:48,173
Well, I was thinking about going
into town tomorrow to see

80
00:12:48,175 --> 00:12:50,978
- if I can find a part-time job.
- Oh, good.

81
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:54,246
Um, I'm actually going into town
to apply for a few jobs,

82
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:55,883
so I could give you a ride,
drop you off.

83
00:12:56,584 --> 00:12:58,753
Oh no, it's okay, I can walk.

84
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,256
You know, maybe the university
offers night classes.

85
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,292
Could help you get a head start.

86
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:07,962
You still planning to go
to school next semester?

87
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:09,596
Um...

88
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:11,798
yeah, I guess.

89
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:16,635
You know, honestly, I don't...
I don't know where I want

90
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:18,906
to go to school next semester.

91
00:13:24,211 --> 00:13:26,679
Honey, part of the condition
of us living in this house

92
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,414
is you have to live here too.

93
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,049
You decide to go
to an out-of-town school...

94
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:31,650
Yeah, I know the conditions,
Mother.

95
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:33,421
You've made them quite clear.

96
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:37,889
You know, you... you also have
a scholarship.

97
00:13:37,891 --> 00:13:39,058
Do you want to throw that away?

98
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,695
Who says I'm throwing
anything away?

99
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:44,097
There's a few places
you could try downtown, um...

100
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,501
try Crave, it's a coffeehouse.

101
00:13:48,335 --> 00:13:50,135
They hire a lot
of part-time help.

102
00:13:50,137 --> 00:13:51,305
Okay.

103
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:54,007
Yeah, I'll check it out
tomorrow.

104
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:05,918
Look, Mom, I...

105
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,420
I know we're in a tough
financial situation right now.

106
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:10,691
I do, but...

107
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:14,327
I also know I can't live
with you guys forever.

108
00:14:14,995 --> 00:14:16,929
I'll do what I have to do
for this family

109
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:18,198
until we get back on our feet,

110
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:22,136
but my life can't revolve around
what happens to this house.

111
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:26,073
You can't keep me here forever.

112
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:32,513
She's right, you know.

113
00:14:34,514 --> 00:14:36,113
Oh, I know...

114
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:39,084
I also know it was your mother
who put us in this situation

115
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,520
and now we are all looking
to you to bring things back

116
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:42,723
to normal.

117
00:14:43,023 --> 00:14:45,058
I'm doing the best that I can.

118
00:14:45,692 --> 00:14:48,327
I... I have three interviews
lined up for tomorrow.

119
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:51,165
Well, let's hope one of them
works out.

120
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:56,269
Can I have some more bread?

121
00:15:07,214 --> 00:15:09,515
Oh.
Hey, Dad, sorry.

122
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:12,186
Oh, it's okay, Rach, um,
I'm all done.

123
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:17,090
You going to bed now?

124
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,525
Uh, yeah, I was just going
to brush my teeth first.

125
00:15:19,527 --> 00:15:20,825
Well, get a good night's sleep

126
00:15:20,827 --> 00:15:22,827
and good luck on the job hunt
tomorrow.

127
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:24,499
Okay, thanks Dad.

128
00:20:45,484 --> 00:20:48,051
Honey... I can't find them.

129
00:20:48,053 --> 00:20:50,690
<i>Oh, I found them,
I found them.</i>

130
00:20:52,926 --> 00:20:55,559
Hey, uh, you sure
you don't need a ride somewhere?

131
00:20:55,561 --> 00:20:58,663
Oh, uh, no, I'm just gonna go
into town

132
00:20:58,665 --> 00:21:00,365
and check out a few places.

133
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,599
- Thanks.
- Good morning, Rachel.

134
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:04,069
Are you off too?

135
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:06,169
- Yep.
- Did you sleep okay?

136
00:21:06,171 --> 00:21:08,575
Uh, yeah, I guess.

137
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:10,610
You guess?

138
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:13,878
Oh well, my closet door
wouldn't stay shut and...

139
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,850
and I heard some noises but it...
it's fine.

140
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:19,451
These old houses, you know,
sometimes they settle

141
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:21,989
and the door frames warp.
I'll look at it for you.

142
00:21:22,388 --> 00:21:25,258
Oh, no, no. It's okay.
I'm fine, I promise.

143
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,262
-Okay... well, wish me luck.

144
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:32,396
- Good luck, honey.
- Yeah, you'll be great.

145
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:33,397
Thanks.

146
00:21:33,399 --> 00:21:34,801
- Bye.
- Bye.

147
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:48,981
Well, I guess I'm gonna head out
too.

148
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:52,319
- Well, be careful and good luck.
- Right.

149
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,461
Oh, look who decided
to grace us with their presence.

150
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,098
- Where's she going?
- To find a job.

151
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,098
I want to find a job too.

152
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,103
Oh, maybe you could find one
unpacking your room.

153
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:12,239
Upstairs.

154
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:20,113
Up.

155
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:35,021
Oh, god...

156
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:37,454
- you scared me.
- I'm so sorry...

157
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:39,893
No, no, no... it's fine.

158
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:43,228
Hi, I'm Maggie.

159
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,433
Hey, Maggie, I'm Rachel.

160
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:48,732
Is this your house?

161
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:49,869
Oh, yeah, I live here
with my mom.

162
00:23:50,203 --> 00:23:52,606
Oh, cool. I actually live
just down the street.

163
00:23:53,072 --> 00:23:54,941
Yeah in the old Dunn house.

164
00:23:57,511 --> 00:23:59,279
Yeah, how did you know?

165
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,245
Oh, I've been watching
your dad fix up the place

166
00:24:02,247 --> 00:24:05,518
- over the past two weeks.
- Oh, okay.

167
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,224
Yeah, um... Miss Dunn was pretty
well known in these parts.

168
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,224
Oh, well that's my grandmother.
I'm Rachel Dunn.

169
00:24:14,226 --> 00:24:16,994
- Miss Dunn was your grandmother?
- Yeah.

170
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:19,364
I inherited the house
and pretty much everything in it

171
00:24:19,366 --> 00:24:21,268
so my family moved here.

172
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,571
- Whoa.
- Yeah, I know, it's kinda weird.

173
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:30,474
Uh, so I have never
really seen you around town.

174
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:31,242
Did you not visit
your grandmother

175
00:24:31,244 --> 00:24:34,244
- because she was...
- Because she was what?

176
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:37,013
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm rude. Tell me
to stop talking.

177
00:24:37,015 --> 00:24:40,353
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, it's fine. Um...

178
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:45,123
Hey...
do you know where Crave is?

179
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,224
Oh, yeah. It's not far
from here.

180
00:24:47,226 --> 00:24:48,693
Okay, I'm trying to get
a part-time job

181
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,129
and my dad said
I should apply there.

182
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,030
Well, I can take you there
if you want.

183
00:24:53,032 --> 00:24:55,366
- Really?
- Yeah, definitely.

184
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,501
- Okay.
- Come with me,

185
00:24:56,503 --> 00:24:57,668
- I'll show you where it is.
- Cool.

186
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,038
- Thanks.
- Okay, come on.

187
00:25:17,323 --> 00:25:18,958
It's so pretty
around here.

188
00:25:21,762 --> 00:25:23,163
Good morning.

189
00:25:23,763 --> 00:25:24,962
- What?
- Look.

190
00:25:24,964 --> 00:25:26,367
Just keep walking.

191
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:02,899
Skinny caramel latte
with almond milk.

192
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:05,705
Uh, are you sure
that's almond milk?

193
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:18,185
Can I help you?

194
00:26:18,418 --> 00:26:21,219
Uh, yeah. Can I get
an application?

195
00:26:21,221 --> 00:26:24,058
Um, okay but we're pretty much
at capacity.

196
00:26:25,123 --> 00:26:26,925
Oh. Really?

197
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:30,696
Um, yeah. It is the place
to work in this town, so...

198
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:35,867
Um, okay. Well, can I just get
an application anyway

199
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:38,504
and fill one out
in case something opens up?

200
00:26:40,173 --> 00:26:42,209
Right. Tyson!

201
00:26:44,077 --> 00:26:47,177
- What, girl?
- Can I get an application for...

202
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:49,713
- Rachel.
- And one for your friend.

203
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:53,087
- Oh, this is Maggie.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Saggie?

204
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:56,988
Maggie. No, I don't need one.

205
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,191
- We're pretty much at capacity.
- I was just explaining that,

206
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:02,628
but she wants
to play application lotto.

207
00:27:15,876 --> 00:27:18,846
Okay, thanks. I'll bring
this right back.

208
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:31,356
I don't know why she acts
like she doesn't know who I am.

209
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,793
We've gone to school together
for years.

210
00:27:34,593 --> 00:27:36,394
I wouldn't worry about her.

211
00:27:36,396 --> 00:27:38,061
She doesn't seem like the kind
of person you'd want

212
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:39,297
to be friends with anyway.

213
00:27:39,898 --> 00:27:41,935
She wouldn't be too fun to work
with either.

214
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:48,175
Yeah, I guess.

215
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:52,446
Hi, I'm, uh... I'm Kevin.

216
00:27:56,248 --> 00:27:59,952
- Rachel, this is Maggie.
- Yeah, I've seen you around.

217
00:28:01,053 --> 00:28:03,421
And I want to keep
my employment options open,

218
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:06,123
even if it means I have to work
with a vapid bitch.

219
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:09,027
I run the club next door. Splat.

220
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:11,398
- Splat?
- Yeah.

221
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:13,063
I'm not 21.

222
00:28:13,065 --> 00:28:16,769
Mm, no, it's...
it's an all-ages establishment.

223
00:28:18,204 --> 00:28:19,906
My dad owns these buildings.

224
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:23,176
- Can I get an application?
- Application?

225
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:27,214
No, no. You don't... you don't
need a stinking application.

226
00:28:27,513 --> 00:28:29,715
You're funny.

227
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,750
So you just moved to town?

228
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,953
Uh, yeah, I'm planning
on attending the university

229
00:28:34,955 --> 00:28:36,022
next semester.

230
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:37,657
Oh, so you moved here
for school?

231
00:28:38,323 --> 00:28:39,725
Uh, not exactly.

232
00:28:40,326 --> 00:28:41,695
Why'd you move here then?

233
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:45,096
Um, my grandmother was
in a nursing home here.

234
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,498
She passed a few months back.

235
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,667
So, my family moved
into her house.

236
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:50,367
She left it to me in her will.

237
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:53,205
Hmm, that's kinda strange,
isn't it?

238
00:28:53,505 --> 00:28:57,174
She didn't have a husband
to leave it to or kids?

239
00:28:57,176 --> 00:29:00,513
- Which would be your...
- Oh, my dad. My dad's her son...

240
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,682
and I don't... I don't think
they got along very well.

241
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:05,148
And then my grandfather died

242
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,119
when my dad was just a baby,
so...

243
00:29:08,554 --> 00:29:10,186
You know, honestly,
I don't remember that much

244
00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:11,423
about my grandmother.

245
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,825
I just remember my parents
had me write her letters

246
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:15,095
when she was
in the nursing home.

247
00:29:16,995 --> 00:29:18,628
- Where's your new house?
- Oh, it's, um...

248
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,235
Rachel, do you want me to get us
a couple coffees?

249
00:29:23,035 --> 00:29:25,168
No, thanks. I'm... I'm good.

250
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,405
It's a good thing you wrote
those letters

251
00:29:27,407 --> 00:29:30,140
'cause you just won
the showcase showdown.

252
00:29:30,142 --> 00:29:31,276
A new house.

253
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:35,078
Yeah, I didn't really do it
to get in her will or anything.

254
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,248
At first I just did it
because my parents made me,

255
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:41,086
but after a while it became
like a therapy or going

256
00:29:41,088 --> 00:29:42,589
to confessional or something.

257
00:29:43,222 --> 00:29:44,358
What do you mean?

258
00:29:45,926 --> 00:29:47,726
I could write to her
about anything.

259
00:29:48,395 --> 00:29:51,264
I told her things I've
never told anybody before...

260
00:29:52,465 --> 00:29:53,667
and then as I got older

261
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:55,699
I realized how lonely
she must be, so I just did it

262
00:29:55,701 --> 00:29:57,971
to give her something
to look forward to.

263
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,405
You know, we lived so far away

264
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:01,808
and didn't really have
much money to travel,

265
00:30:02,274 --> 00:30:05,211
otherwise we could have
visited more, I guess.

266
00:30:09,948 --> 00:30:13,085
Would you want to go next door,
check out the club?

267
00:30:14,553 --> 00:30:16,186
Yeah, why not?

268
00:30:16,188 --> 00:30:18,090
Have you finished
that application yet?

269
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,461
- Yeah, here you go...
- I'll take that.

270
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,696
I'll take that.

271
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:27,367
Don't snatch, snatch.

272
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,306
- Rachel Dunn.
- Yeah.

273
00:30:34,072 --> 00:30:37,474
And this is your address,
the old Dunn house?

274
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:42,048
Yeah, my grandmother
was Albertha Dunn.

275
00:30:42,314 --> 00:30:44,449
Why?

276
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,251
This makes perfect sense now.

277
00:30:46,253 --> 00:30:48,588
No wonder you're hanging out
with a loser like Saggie.

278
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:50,856
Come on, Rachel. Let's get out
of here.

279
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,859
- Let's get out of here.
- No, what?

280
00:30:54,526 --> 00:30:57,530
This is classic. I am dead.

281
00:30:58,496 --> 00:30:59,532
Officially.

282
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:07,405
Maggie! Maggie, what the fuck?

283
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,306
I just had to get you out
of there before she said...

284
00:31:09,308 --> 00:31:12,045
- Before she said what?
- About your grandmother.

285
00:31:12,512 --> 00:31:14,379
What about my grandmother?

286
00:31:14,981 --> 00:31:16,646
I assumed you knew
but after what you said

287
00:31:16,648 --> 00:31:17,984
about writing her those letters.

288
00:31:18,217 --> 00:31:20,686
Okay, okay, listen. You have got
to tell me what's going on.

289
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:24,123
Come to my house. We need
to talk.

290
00:31:27,225 --> 00:31:28,494
Okay.

291
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:40,037
Okay, so this is strange.
How do I begin?

292
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:42,008
Just talk.
What's going on?

293
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,810
You know how in scary movies

294
00:31:46,812 --> 00:31:49,014
there's always
like the town crazy?

295
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:52,383
You know, like, the one person
that people always try to avoid

296
00:31:52,385 --> 00:31:54,954
or parents tell their kids not
to talk to?

297
00:31:56,188 --> 00:32:02,592
- Uh, yeah, I guess.
- Well... here in Horse Creek,

298
00:32:02,594 --> 00:32:06,165
the town crazy was your
grandmother, Albertha Dunn.

299
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,267
Excuse me?

300
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:10,102
Well, ever since I was a kid,

301
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:12,736
my mom would tell me not
to go near her house, you know,

302
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:16,308
like "Stay away or she might
put you in the oven," she'd say.

303
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:18,776
Okay, so you're...
you're telling me that everyone

304
00:32:18,778 --> 00:32:21,381
in this town picked
on my grandmother for no reason.

305
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,716
She was bullied and it
just stuck all these years.

306
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,118
No, there was a reason people
said all those things about her.

307
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,021
Okay, what was the reason?

308
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:31,891
They say she was a witch.

309
00:32:34,761 --> 00:32:37,128
Okay, yeah because that makes
perfect sense.

310
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:40,900
Rachel, your grandmother wasn't
in a nursing home...

311
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,470
she was in an asylum.

312
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:46,439
What?

313
00:32:48,474 --> 00:32:51,274
Well, when I heard you talking
about writing her those letters

314
00:32:51,276 --> 00:32:52,544
in the nursing home,

315
00:32:52,778 --> 00:32:54,444
I figured you didn't know
all the details,

316
00:32:54,446 --> 00:32:57,449
so I had to get you out of there
so I could explain.

317
00:32:57,951 --> 00:32:59,853
No, no, but...

318
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:04,523
but I sent her letters.
I have the address right here.

319
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:08,227
I have it.

320
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,396
I have the address in here
somewhere.

321
00:33:10,628 --> 00:33:11,665
Here it is.

322
00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:14,967
Go to the address. You'll see.

323
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,172
Why would she be in an asylum?

324
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,306
About ten years ago,

325
00:33:22,308 --> 00:33:25,811
she got caught with some corpses
in her house.

326
00:33:27,414 --> 00:33:30,116
- Corpses?
- Yes.

327
00:33:30,484 --> 00:33:32,818
Down the street
at the old cemetery,

328
00:33:33,418 --> 00:33:36,252
there were several graves
that had been dug up

329
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:38,789
and no one knew who was doing it
until they set up surveillance

330
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:41,328
and they caught her coming back
to dig up another body.

331
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:44,196
Wait.

332
00:33:44,796 --> 00:33:47,299
Why would she be digging
up graves?

333
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,334
They went to her house

334
00:33:49,336 --> 00:33:50,734
and they found
the missing bodies

335
00:33:50,736 --> 00:33:53,438
and she had been doing some type
of ritual on them.

336
00:33:54,106 --> 00:33:56,643
That's why she was sent
to the asylum.

337
00:33:58,778 --> 00:34:00,112
Great.

338
00:34:00,612 --> 00:34:01,945
Everyone in this freaking town

339
00:34:01,947 --> 00:34:03,348
is going to think
we're the Mansons.

340
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,217
- No, I'm sure they don't.
- I gotta go.

341
00:34:06,785 --> 00:34:09,054
No, no, wait.

342
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:16,028
Rachel, wait.

343
00:34:20,132 --> 00:34:21,833
Oh, my... Jesus!

344
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:24,104
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

345
00:34:31,978 --> 00:34:35,014
- Who the hell was that?
- That was Rachel.

346
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,882
She sure was in a hurry.

347
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,782
What'd you do,
show her your book collection?

348
00:34:39,784 --> 00:34:42,186
No, Mother, she just moved
to town

349
00:34:42,188 --> 00:34:45,491
- and she hasn't met anyone yet.
- Well, she sure was in a hurry.

350
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,092
She lives just down the street.

351
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:49,692
She inherited
her grandmother's old house.

352
00:34:49,694 --> 00:34:52,230
- They just moved in this week.
- What old house?

353
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:56,134
- The Dunn house.
- You're joking, right?

354
00:34:56,735 --> 00:34:58,605
No, Miss Dunn
was her grandmother.

355
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,942
Let me tell you something.

356
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,576
You keep that witchcraft out
of here, you got me?

357
00:35:05,578 --> 00:35:07,043
I don't want no evil in here.

358
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:09,813
- Keep it far, far away from me.
- Mom.

359
00:35:09,815 --> 00:35:11,348
You know,
I don't understand you.

360
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,217
I mean, everybody
in this town's talking about me,

361
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:15,152
how I'm a single mother
raising a child.

362
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,420
I don't need them talking

363
00:35:16,422 --> 00:35:17,987
about me like I'm
in some devil cult.

364
00:35:17,989 --> 00:35:19,755
Who cares what people
in this town think, Mom?

365
00:35:19,757 --> 00:35:21,092
I don't get you.

366
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:23,893
Why... why can't you
just dress nicely

367
00:35:23,895 --> 00:35:26,999
and have nice friends,
be popular?

368
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:31,634
Look, she just moved to town,
okay,

369
00:35:31,636 --> 00:35:33,605
and I thought it would be nice.

370
00:35:34,473 --> 00:35:39,144
You know, I'm sorry. Okay.
I know you are a sweet soul.

371
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:41,980
You have such a good heart...

372
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:47,586
and such a tiny brain just
like your stupid-ass father.

373
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:52,290
Because he took in every stray
that he encountered too

374
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:56,127
and that's why he left us for
that skank-ass bitch stripper.

375
00:35:56,462 --> 00:35:59,165
You know, I heard she
had a blue waffle.

376
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,534
You should google it!

377
00:36:56,054 --> 00:36:57,223
Mom?

378
00:38:04,922 --> 00:38:06,456
Mom!

379
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:08,257
What did I tell you
about rough housing inside?

380
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:10,561
- There's something in my room.
- What?

381
00:38:10,563 --> 00:38:11,597
Look.

382
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:15,969
It's on the other side
of my bed. It was a...

383
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:21,905
- A something.
- Well, if it comes back,

384
00:38:21,907 --> 00:38:24,377
maybe you can have it unpack
your room.

385
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,444
- But Mom...
- No, no moms, no buts,

386
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:29,413
no "deez nuts". I'm not kidding,

387
00:38:29,415 --> 00:38:31,248
you're not leaving this room
until it's unpacked.

388
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:33,085
I want all
of these boxes put away.

389
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,799
<i>Rachel, your grandmother
wasn't in a nursing home.</i>

390
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,136
<i>She was in an asylum.</i>

391
00:40:10,715 --> 00:40:13,418
<i>Go to the address, you'll see.</i>

392
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,831
Hey honey, how did it go?

393
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,401
- Huh?
- With the job search.

394
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:44,969
Oh, um, yeah, it went fine.

395
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:46,335
I put an application
in at Crave.

396
00:42:46,337 --> 00:42:48,739
God damn it.

397
00:42:48,741 --> 00:42:49,907
You know, I told your brother

398
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:51,108
about playing ball
in this house.

399
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,244
You go up there
and tell him

400
00:42:52,411 --> 00:42:53,842
that if I hear one more thing
hit the floor,

401
00:42:53,844 --> 00:42:55,714
he is gonna be the next thing
to hit the floor.

402
00:42:56,549 --> 00:42:57,550
Please.

403
00:42:58,851 --> 00:42:59,886
Okay.

404
00:43:13,965 --> 00:43:16,766
Andy, you little roach,
what did Mom tell you

405
00:43:16,768 --> 00:43:18,704
about playing with that ball
in the house?

406
00:44:06,851 --> 00:44:08,083
Yeah, he was, uh,

407
00:44:08,085 --> 00:44:10,288
really impressed
with what I had to say.

408
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,456
I don't know if it's for sure,

409
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:15,494
but... I think I might be
the one.

410
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:18,128
Yeah? That sounds great, honey.

411
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,534
You are the smartest accountant
I know. Right, guys?

412
00:44:24,569 --> 00:44:26,703
Well, once I get on
with this firm,

413
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,507
everything's gonna change
for us.

414
00:44:28,808 --> 00:44:30,040
It's a great opportunity

415
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,275
and I can only move up
once I get on.

416
00:44:32,277 --> 00:44:33,409
That sounds great.

417
00:44:33,411 --> 00:44:35,313
Finally, some good news
for once.

418
00:44:35,614 --> 00:44:38,184
Yeah, Dad, that's really great.

419
00:44:38,817 --> 00:44:40,185
Thanks, Rach.

420
00:44:41,353 --> 00:44:42,820
So, um...

421
00:44:42,822 --> 00:44:45,023
Rachel put an application
in at Crave today.

422
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:48,824
Oh really? Well, maybe
if I get this job,

423
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:51,062
I can help you get a car.

424
00:44:51,496 --> 00:44:54,799
I... I know only having one's
been hard on you guys, so...

425
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,670
Yeah, Dad,
that would be amazing!

426
00:44:57,935 --> 00:44:59,735
And do you know what else
you can help me with?

427
00:44:59,737 --> 00:45:02,005
- What?
- Oh and Mom, you can help me

428
00:45:02,007 --> 00:45:03,975
- with this too.
- Yeah, okay, what?

429
00:45:04,677 --> 00:45:06,610
You two can help me understand

430
00:45:06,612 --> 00:45:09,279
why grandmother was actually
in a mental asylum

431
00:45:09,281 --> 00:45:10,512
instead of a nursing home

432
00:45:10,514 --> 00:45:12,384
like you've told me
all these years.

433
00:45:14,554 --> 00:45:16,953
Rachel, I don't know
what you're talking about.

434
00:45:16,955 --> 00:45:18,655
Did you not think it would
eventually come out

435
00:45:18,657 --> 00:45:21,791
considering everyone
in this damn town

436
00:45:21,793 --> 00:45:23,228
thinks she was a witch?

437
00:45:24,128 --> 00:45:28,465
- Grandma was a witch?
- No, Andy, of course not.

438
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:31,201
So, all these years,
I was writing her letters

439
00:45:31,203 --> 00:45:33,369
thinking they were going
to a nursing home

440
00:45:33,371 --> 00:45:35,838
but really they were going
to an insane asylum.

441
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,507
- Rachel...
- I mean, why even have me

442
00:45:37,509 --> 00:45:39,410
write her letters
in the first place?

443
00:45:39,777 --> 00:45:42,346
Was this like some ploy
or some shit for me to stay

444
00:45:42,348 --> 00:45:43,980
in her will so she would
leave me this house?

445
00:45:43,982 --> 00:45:45,083
Of course not.

446
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,851
Then why wouldn't you
tell me?

447
00:45:47,752 --> 00:45:49,853
What did you expect us to do?

448
00:45:49,855 --> 00:45:53,056
You were a kid. Hell,
Andy wasn't even born yet.

449
00:45:53,058 --> 00:45:54,991
Oh yeah, honey, I'm sorry,
your grandmother's

450
00:45:54,993 --> 00:45:57,194
in a mental asylum.
Do you know what that is?

451
00:45:57,196 --> 00:46:00,297
- Sarah.
- No, oh and she's insane too,

452
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,199
but be a lamb
and write her some letters

453
00:46:02,201 --> 00:46:03,903
so she doesn't feel so lonely.

454
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,373
Did you two have something to do
with her being put in there?

455
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,007
Is that why she let you out
of the will?

456
00:46:11,009 --> 00:46:12,875
It wasn't my fault
she was put there.

457
00:46:12,877 --> 00:46:14,879
Andy, go up to your room.

458
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:16,749
I'm scared to.

459
00:46:17,516 --> 00:46:20,215
You know everyone
in this town thinks I'm crazy

460
00:46:20,217 --> 00:46:22,886
because my grandmother
was apparently a witch?

461
00:46:22,888 --> 00:46:25,188
Today some girl at Crave laughed
at me when she found out

462
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:26,192
where I live.

463
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:28,960
Do you think that you're
the only one who gets the looks?

464
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,661
People walk by
this house staring,

465
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:33,063
like...
We know what it's like too.

466
00:46:34,098 --> 00:46:36,401
- Rachel, stop.
- What?

467
00:46:37,101 --> 00:46:40,705
My mother,
your grandmother was not well.

468
00:46:41,672 --> 00:46:44,743
She did things and said things
that were not normal.

469
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,878
Yes, she thought she was a witch

470
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,913
but there's no such thing
as witches.

471
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:51,447
I don't believe in it.

472
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:54,286
She was put in that asylum
because she needed help.

473
00:46:57,456 --> 00:47:01,927
Yeah, okay. Well, Maggie said
she kept corpses in the house.

474
00:47:04,295 --> 00:47:06,098
Yeah, she did.

475
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,065
God, I love how you say
that so casually.

476
00:47:09,067 --> 00:47:10,866
- "Yeah, she did."
- Well,

477
00:47:10,868 --> 00:47:13,271
since we're being honest here,
let's just be honest.

478
00:47:13,772 --> 00:47:15,905
- Okay.
- Yeah, she had bodies

479
00:47:15,907 --> 00:47:20,677
in the house and sometimes
she would... cut off some ears

480
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:23,112
- and some noses and some...
- Steve, no. Honey, no.

481
00:47:23,114 --> 00:47:27,019
And then she was caught
and that was the last straw.

482
00:47:27,585 --> 00:47:31,790
Okay. The authorities gave me
the option of coming to get her

483
00:47:32,456 --> 00:47:35,493
- or placing her somewhere.
- So you put her away?

484
00:47:35,993 --> 00:47:37,862
I didn't know what
she might do...

485
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:40,165
okay?

486
00:47:42,132 --> 00:47:44,500
It was out of my hands.
Why do you think I moved out

487
00:47:44,502 --> 00:47:46,971
so far away from her
in the first place?

488
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:49,338
I wanted out, I didn't want
to go back

489
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,643
and I didn't want her around
my family.

490
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:58,315
Honey, we thought it was best
if you didn't know the details.

491
00:47:58,317 --> 00:48:00,116
And once she was moved
into the facility,

492
00:48:00,118 --> 00:48:03,521
the nurses reached out to us
and they thought, you know,

493
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,790
maybe if she has some contact
with her only granddaughter,

494
00:48:06,792 --> 00:48:08,525
it would do her some good.

495
00:48:08,527 --> 00:48:11,297
So, yeah, we had you write her
some letters.

496
00:48:12,331 --> 00:48:14,367
Seeing her was out
of the question.

497
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,169
But I didn't see the problem
with you writing her.

498
00:48:18,871 --> 00:48:22,172
Hell, I thought it might help
her, maybe snap her

499
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:24,744
out of this dark place
that she was in.

500
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:29,045
Wh... why didn't you ask me
to write her letters?

501
00:48:29,047 --> 00:48:31,684
Honey, we didn't even want
to tell her you were born.

502
00:48:33,185 --> 00:48:36,152
So why did she leave me
the house?

503
00:48:36,154 --> 00:48:40,024
I don't know... maybe she
just wanted you to have it.

504
00:48:40,558 --> 00:48:42,157
Maybe she wanted
to make things right

505
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:45,362
- with the family.
- By forcing me to live here?

506
00:48:45,364 --> 00:48:47,297
How is that going
to make things right?

507
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,435
Considering our
financial situation,

508
00:48:49,835 --> 00:48:53,572
leaving you the house was a gift
for us, Rachel.

509
00:48:55,706 --> 00:48:57,875
And once we're back
on our feet...

510
00:48:58,576 --> 00:49:00,645
once everything's back
to normal...

511
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:03,281
we can move, you can move.

512
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:16,929
This is a chance... for you
to do something for your family.

513
00:49:19,197 --> 00:49:21,733
You have to know how hard it is
for me as a man...

514
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:24,903
as your father to ask you
for help.

515
00:49:30,141 --> 00:49:31,677
Okay, um...

516
00:49:33,078 --> 00:49:36,112
Well, she may have just thought
she was a witch

517
00:49:36,114 --> 00:49:39,250
and you might not believe
in witches...

518
00:49:40,418 --> 00:49:43,520
but there's been some weird
stuff going on in this house.

519
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,623
I... I don't understand
like what... what?

520
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:49,458
Noises, banging,
seeing things one second

521
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,994
and not the next,
doors opening...

522
00:49:51,996 --> 00:49:53,462
That thing in my room.

523
00:49:53,464 --> 00:49:55,431
Andy, there was nothing
in your room and Rachel,

524
00:49:55,433 --> 00:49:57,266
this could all just be
in your head.

525
00:49:57,268 --> 00:50:00,138
You just moved into a new house.
It's a new town.

526
00:50:00,438 --> 00:50:02,241
You just found out
about your grandmother.

527
00:50:02,607 --> 00:50:05,176
I told you I'd fix that door,
didn't I?

528
00:50:06,578 --> 00:50:08,777
Your grandmother
was a sick woman

529
00:50:08,779 --> 00:50:10,315
who had some problems...

530
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:14,252
but she wasn't a witch,
I promise.

531
00:50:15,152 --> 00:50:17,589
It's a small town, people talk
and gossip.

532
00:50:18,889 --> 00:50:20,558
But we all know the truth.

533
00:50:21,326 --> 00:50:24,830
She just had problems... okay?

534
00:50:27,299 --> 00:50:28,400
Okay...

535
00:50:29,167 --> 00:50:30,402
fine.

536
00:50:31,103 --> 00:50:33,005
- Honey, where are you going?
- I need some air.

537
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:23,686
- Nice house.
- Kevin?

538
00:51:23,688 --> 00:51:25,924
- Hey.
- Hey.

539
00:51:26,657 --> 00:51:28,558
Hey look, if you're here
to make fun of me or something...

540
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,228
Why would I do that?

541
00:51:30,661 --> 00:51:32,427
Because everyone in this town
thinks my grandmother...

542
00:51:32,429 --> 00:51:35,234
Who cares what anyone
in this shit-hole town thinks?

543
00:51:36,534 --> 00:51:38,534
So this is your house now, huh?

544
00:51:38,536 --> 00:51:41,572
- Wow.
- Yep, that's it.

545
00:51:42,074 --> 00:51:43,572
You got to admit,
we could host a pretty

546
00:51:43,574 --> 00:51:46,543
- wicked Halloween party here.
- Wicked?

547
00:51:47,578 --> 00:51:51,516
- Yeah, you know, like a wicked...
- Yeah, I know, I know.

548
00:51:51,917 --> 00:51:53,685
I'm just messing with you.

549
00:51:57,188 --> 00:52:00,726
So, hey, when are you gonna come
by the club, Splat?

550
00:52:02,259 --> 00:52:07,131
- Um... I don't know, tomorrow?
- Okay, how about noon?

551
00:52:08,766 --> 00:52:11,201
- Yeah, sounds good.
- All right,

552
00:52:11,203 --> 00:52:13,138
- I'll see you then.
- Okay.

553
00:52:20,378 --> 00:52:21,746
Okay, what's wrong?

554
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:25,280
I hope she understands
why we kept this from her.

555
00:52:25,282 --> 00:52:27,786
Oh... she's a smart girl...

556
00:52:30,121 --> 00:52:31,822
and once she calms down
she'll realize that we had

557
00:52:31,824 --> 00:52:33,792
to do what was best
for the family.

558
00:52:34,592 --> 00:52:36,662
I just feel like a failure.

559
00:52:37,828 --> 00:52:39,696
I'm supposed to take care
of the family.

560
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:42,500
I am supposed to be
the breadwinner of the family...

561
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,132
and I'm relying on my daughter

562
00:52:44,134 --> 00:52:45,436
to get us
through this hard time.

563
00:52:45,737 --> 00:52:47,402
You are not a failure.

564
00:52:47,404 --> 00:52:49,840
Losing your job was
just bad luck.

565
00:52:50,607 --> 00:52:54,143
But things will get better...
and once you get this new job...

566
00:52:54,145 --> 00:52:56,647
- If I get this new job.
- When...

567
00:52:57,415 --> 00:52:59,681
When you get this new job,
things will really start

568
00:52:59,683 --> 00:53:01,119
to turn around.

569
00:53:03,154 --> 00:53:05,987
You know, getting this house,
it really was a gift.

570
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:07,525
It gave us a place to live.

571
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,860
Even if the whole neighborhood
thinks my mom is an old,

572
00:53:10,862 --> 00:53:12,762
evil witch that lives in a big,
scary house.

573
00:53:12,764 --> 00:53:15,167
Steven, your mother
was not a witch.

574
00:53:15,433 --> 00:53:17,268
I know it and you know it.

575
00:53:17,636 --> 00:53:19,638
I don't know what I know
anymore.

576
00:53:20,438 --> 00:53:23,040
You know it was Alzheimer's,
right?

577
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,976
I just never thought I'd end up
in this place ever again.

578
00:53:26,978 --> 00:53:28,813
It... it won't be for long.

579
00:53:30,482 --> 00:53:31,984
I hope so.

580
00:53:34,185 --> 00:53:35,320
Night.

581
00:53:35,953 --> 00:53:37,388
Night.

582
01:00:13,418 --> 01:00:16,888
Hey... your mom let me in.

583
01:00:17,621 --> 01:00:20,590
- Sorry.
- Is this a bad time?

584
01:00:20,592 --> 01:00:23,358
No, no, no, I'm actually just
about to meet Kevin at Crave.

585
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:25,628
Oh, you're meeting Kevin?

586
01:00:25,895 --> 01:00:28,298
Oh, yeah, um...

587
01:00:28,732 --> 01:00:30,132
you know, he just wanted
to show me around

588
01:00:30,134 --> 01:00:31,534
and I still need a job.

589
01:00:32,002 --> 01:00:33,902
I just wanted to make sure
you weren't mad

590
01:00:33,904 --> 01:00:35,871
about the other day at my house.

591
01:00:35,873 --> 01:00:39,444
Oh, no, no, of course not.
Um, it's just a lot to take in.

592
01:00:39,743 --> 01:00:42,479
Your mom probably thinks
I'm so rude.

593
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,083
She looks really young
by the way.

594
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:48,650
Oh, well she had me when she was
like 16, so...

595
01:00:48,652 --> 01:00:50,820
- Oh.
- My grandparents kicked her out

596
01:00:50,822 --> 01:00:52,323
when they found out and...

597
01:00:52,956 --> 01:00:54,859
she needed a job
to support herself and...

598
01:00:55,393 --> 01:00:57,092
there were no reality cable
TV shows

599
01:00:57,094 --> 01:00:58,893
that exploited teen moms
back then.

600
01:00:58,895 --> 01:01:02,098
So, she dropped out of school
and became a waitress.

601
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,398
Wow.

602
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:05,636
Yeah, she's been a waitress
ever since.

603
01:01:06,103 --> 01:01:07,603
She did eventually marry my dad,

604
01:01:07,605 --> 01:01:11,076
but he left us a few years ago
for a stripper.

605
01:01:12,409 --> 01:01:14,244
I'm sorry.

606
01:01:15,112 --> 01:01:17,248
God, I thought my family
had problems.

607
01:01:17,614 --> 01:01:18,947
Oh yeah, did you talk
to your parents

608
01:01:18,949 --> 01:01:21,518
about the whole asylum thing?

609
01:01:21,819 --> 01:01:23,054
Yeah.

610
01:01:23,321 --> 01:01:25,753
We had a big old family fight
about it last night.

611
01:01:25,755 --> 01:01:26,857
Oh no.

612
01:01:27,257 --> 01:01:29,194
You know, it's fine,
it was bound to come out.

613
01:01:30,927 --> 01:01:32,196
What's that?

614
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:36,632
Um, you know what, I don't know,
I just found it.

615
01:01:36,634 --> 01:01:38,670
It's like an old journal
or something.

616
01:01:40,136 --> 01:01:41,805
Was this your grandmother's?

617
01:01:42,339 --> 01:01:46,511
Yeah, Albertha Dunn,
right on the front page.

618
01:01:47,444 --> 01:01:49,246
This is her <i>Book of Shadows.</i>

619
01:01:49,947 --> 01:01:51,282
Her what?

620
01:01:51,482 --> 01:01:52,947
<i>Book of Shadows,</i> all witches
have them. It has,

621
01:01:52,949 --> 01:01:54,784
like, their spells and stuff
like that in it.

622
01:01:54,786 --> 01:01:56,552
Where'd you read that,
<i>Witch-pedia?</i>

623
01:01:56,554 --> 01:01:59,121
- No, I'm serious.
- Maggie, listen...

624
01:01:59,123 --> 01:02:01,491
I know everyone in this town
thought she was a witch, okay

625
01:02:01,493 --> 01:02:03,326
but really she was just sick.

626
01:02:03,328 --> 01:02:05,594
It was like Alzheimer's
or something.

627
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:08,065
- My parents told me.
- Can I borrow this?

628
01:02:09,132 --> 01:02:11,468
Uh, yeah.

629
01:02:12,436 --> 01:02:14,973
I'll... I'll get it back
to you later.

630
01:02:15,505 --> 01:02:16,708
Okay.

631
01:02:39,331 --> 01:02:41,199
Where the hell
have you been?

632
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:43,768
Nowhere.

633
01:02:45,402 --> 01:02:47,038
Why are you home?

634
01:02:47,304 --> 01:02:50,639
Oh, I'm sorry, I... I took a day
off. Is that okay?

635
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,206
Is it all right if I take a day
off

636
01:02:52,208 --> 01:02:55,378
or should I be working every day
of the god damn week

637
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:57,782
so I can keep a roof
over your head?

638
01:02:58,281 --> 01:02:59,817
I was just wondering.

639
01:03:01,386 --> 01:03:02,953
What are you doing?

640
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:06,556
Nothing. Just hanging out
with some friends.

641
01:03:06,558 --> 01:03:08,126
What friends?

642
01:03:09,927 --> 01:03:11,062
Rachel.

643
01:03:11,529 --> 01:03:13,797
Oh god, the girl
in the witch house?

644
01:03:14,065 --> 01:03:15,900
Yep, that one.

645
01:03:16,266 --> 01:03:18,567
What did I tell you?
I said do not hang out...

646
01:03:18,569 --> 01:03:22,237
I don't care, okay. She
and her family are nice people.

647
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:25,808
Mm... no they're not,
they're evil sinners!

648
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:29,614
Sinners, really?
And who are you, Mother Theresa?

649
01:03:30,081 --> 01:03:32,614
You better watch your mouth,
young lady.

650
01:03:32,616 --> 01:03:33,983
If your father was here...

651
01:03:33,985 --> 01:03:36,753
Well guess what, Mom,
he's not here.

652
01:03:37,621 --> 01:03:39,891
He's not here
and he's not coming back...

653
01:03:40,223 --> 01:03:41,892
so deal with it.

654
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,295
Yeah.

655
01:03:45,263 --> 01:03:47,065
Why would he come back?

656
01:03:50,301 --> 01:03:54,605
I'm going to my room...
have another drink, Mom.

657
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:00,645
Don't mind if I do.

658
01:04:24,969 --> 01:04:26,371
So you're back?

659
01:04:27,371 --> 01:04:28,406
Yeah.

660
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,208
Table for one?

661
01:04:31,107 --> 01:04:32,308
No, I'm meeting Kevin.

662
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:35,246
Kevin! Why are you meeting
Kevin?

663
01:04:35,513 --> 01:04:37,681
Oh, well, it's because...

664
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:40,050
Actually, no. It's none
of your business.

665
01:04:40,317 --> 01:04:41,650
Look, new girl.

666
01:04:41,652 --> 01:04:43,085
Your grandmother may have been
the town witch,

667
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:45,688
- but I'm the town bitch, okay?
- It's true.

668
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:48,126
And you're not gonna sashay
in here and take over.

669
01:04:48,525 --> 01:04:51,462
Oh, is that what I'm doing,
taking over?

670
01:04:52,029 --> 01:04:54,398
Kevin is not interested in you.

671
01:04:55,532 --> 01:04:57,935
Look, waitress person.

672
01:04:58,302 --> 01:04:59,701
She went there.

673
01:04:59,703 --> 01:05:02,036
I'm not about to play your
high school games, okay?

674
01:05:02,038 --> 01:05:03,739
I do not want to fight you
for some guy.

675
01:05:03,741 --> 01:05:05,708
It's 'cause you know
I'd beat your ass.

676
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:08,012
- Guys, what's up?
- Hey, Kevin.

677
01:05:08,846 --> 01:05:10,281
- Rachel.
- Hey.

678
01:05:10,547 --> 01:05:12,114
Come on, I'll show you around.

679
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:14,052
Kevin, when are you going
to call me?

680
01:05:15,085 --> 01:05:17,652
Tristen, I've just been
so busy trying

681
01:05:17,654 --> 01:05:18,987
to get this club off the ground.

682
01:05:18,989 --> 01:05:21,357
Well, if you need any help,

683
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:24,094
you know I'd do anything
for you.

684
01:05:25,128 --> 01:05:26,395
Cool. Uh, you know,

685
01:05:26,397 --> 01:05:29,132
we do have a rat problem
in the basement...

686
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:31,770
do you think you could set
some traps?

687
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:37,609
- I have a customer.
- Uh.

688
01:05:40,043 --> 01:05:41,980
- It's a good one.
- Come on.

689
01:05:55,391 --> 01:05:56,992
Wish me luck, second interview.

690
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,626
Oh, honey, I don't think
you need any luck.

691
01:05:58,628 --> 01:06:00,628
They must like you
if they called you back already.

692
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:02,364
We'll see.

693
01:06:02,366 --> 01:06:03,333
- Bye.
- Bye.

694
01:06:04,569 --> 01:06:06,271
- Bye, sport.
- Bye, Dad.

695
01:06:07,438 --> 01:06:10,441
- These are the last two.
- Wow, honey, good job.

696
01:06:10,909 --> 01:06:12,444
Where do you want me
to put them?

697
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:15,177
Um, just take them down
to the basement and put them

698
01:06:15,179 --> 01:06:16,147
with the others.

699
01:06:16,947 --> 01:06:20,585
- Th... the basement?
- Yeah, go on.

700
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:03,186
Hey, what did I tell you
about rough housing inside?

701
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:05,223
And shut the door!

702
01:09:03,047 --> 01:09:04,813
So what do you think,
do you want a job

703
01:09:04,815 --> 01:09:07,218
or do I need to keep trying
to impress you?

704
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:11,121
No, you've impressed me enough.
When do I start?

705
01:09:11,521 --> 01:09:13,521
Well, right now we're only open
Friday and Saturday nights.

706
01:09:13,523 --> 01:09:14,958
So you can start this Friday
if you want.

707
01:09:15,392 --> 01:09:16,927
What would I be doing?

708
01:09:17,393 --> 01:09:21,999
Working the door,
checking coats, getting tips.

709
01:10:47,517 --> 01:10:49,751
- So, I'll see you on Friday?
- Friday it is.

710
01:10:49,753 --> 01:10:51,921
Thanks for giving me
a job.

711
01:10:51,923 --> 01:10:53,689
Well, I mean it was
either hire you

712
01:10:53,691 --> 01:10:55,859
or risk having your grandmother
come after me.

713
01:10:56,692 --> 01:10:58,693
- Shut up.
- Bye.

714
01:10:58,695 --> 01:10:59,696
Bye.

715
01:11:03,499 --> 01:11:04,801
Hey, Rach!

716
01:11:06,437 --> 01:11:08,539
Hey, Rach. Hold up.

717
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,840
- Hey.
- Uh, I have some stuff I have

718
01:11:11,842 --> 01:11:14,542
- to show you.
- Uh, okay. Let's go to my room.

719
01:11:14,544 --> 01:11:16,213
Okay.

720
01:11:18,514 --> 01:11:20,181
- Hey, girls.
- Oh hey, Mom.

721
01:11:20,183 --> 01:11:22,018
Hey, Mrs. Dunn.

722
01:11:33,196 --> 01:11:34,297
Hi!

723
01:11:40,937 --> 01:11:42,737
Oh, look at me, I'm a witch.

724
01:11:42,739 --> 01:11:45,676
Oh, I'll get you,
my little pretty!

725
01:11:55,218 --> 01:11:57,551
So, I've been reading this thing
all day.

726
01:11:57,553 --> 01:11:59,089
Oh, yeah?

727
01:12:04,128 --> 01:12:07,431
- So, what do you think?
- Mom.

728
01:12:08,097 --> 01:12:11,034
Found it in the attic. I think
it belonged to your father.

729
01:12:11,334 --> 01:12:12,569
Oh, really?

730
01:12:12,969 --> 01:12:14,437
Thought maybe you'd like
to have it.

731
01:12:16,072 --> 01:12:19,776
Okay. Yeah, thanks.

732
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:23,681
- Well, I'll leave you two be.
- Okay.

733
01:12:35,892 --> 01:12:37,559
So, I think
I know why your grandmother

734
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:38,963
was keeping corpses
in her house.

735
01:12:39,797 --> 01:12:42,831
- Um, okay.
- It's a ritual.

736
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:45,636
It's here in her <i>Book
of Shadows.</i>

737
01:12:47,304 --> 01:12:51,006
The five points of the pentagram
represent the five senses,

738
01:12:51,008 --> 01:12:55,310
sight, hearing, smell, taste
and touch. You offer a sacrifice

739
01:12:55,312 --> 01:12:57,513
of each sense to the spirit
of Lumiru.

740
01:12:57,813 --> 01:12:59,717
- Lumiru?
- Yes.

741
01:13:00,049 --> 01:13:02,716
Those who practice, believe
that offering sacrifices

742
01:13:02,718 --> 01:13:05,688
will allow you
to not only possess another body

743
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:08,357
when you die but become
that person

744
01:13:08,359 --> 01:13:11,995
and take over their spirit.
It's called transfixication.

745
01:13:12,896 --> 01:13:15,663
Wait, wasn't this that movie
with Sarah Jessica Parker

746
01:13:15,665 --> 01:13:18,632
- and Bette Midler?
- No, Rachel, I'm serious.

747
01:13:18,634 --> 01:13:20,868
When your grandmother had
those bodies in her house,

748
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:23,539
she cut off the ear of one
and hand of the other.

749
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,043
She was trying to complete
the ritual.

750
01:13:26,843 --> 01:13:29,844
The only problem was it has
to be performed

751
01:13:29,846 --> 01:13:31,548
on living sacrifices.

752
01:13:32,048 --> 01:13:33,448
It won't work otherwise.

753
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:36,150
Okay, so... so this is getting
a little ridic.

754
01:13:36,152 --> 01:13:38,588
Wh... what is the point
of the ritual?

755
01:13:39,188 --> 01:13:41,689
It's sort of like reincarnation,

756
01:13:41,691 --> 01:13:44,493
except you get
to choose who you become.

757
01:13:44,995 --> 01:13:48,699
Okay. Well, if she really
believed this

758
01:13:48,999 --> 01:13:50,398
that in fact does prove

759
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,667
that she was sick
and she needed mental help.

760
01:13:52,669 --> 01:13:54,269
No, Rachel, this is a ritual

761
01:13:54,271 --> 01:13:56,807
that has been recorded
for years and years.

762
01:13:57,273 --> 01:13:59,073
It's not something some
crazy woman made up

763
01:13:59,075 --> 01:14:00,143
because she had Alzheimer's.

764
01:14:11,454 --> 01:14:13,756
Another door
that won't stay closed.

765
01:14:14,357 --> 01:14:17,727
What? Does that happen
a lot here?

766
01:14:18,562 --> 01:14:19,760
Have you been experiencing

767
01:14:19,762 --> 01:14:21,931
paranormal phenomena
in this house?

768
01:14:22,531 --> 01:14:25,200
Well, yeah
but just stupid stuff...

769
01:14:25,768 --> 01:14:27,905
like my closet door won't
stay closed and...

770
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:31,008
I keep hearing noises
in the house.

771
01:14:32,075 --> 01:14:34,208
And there was this rocking horse
in the attic

772
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:37,080
that was rocking right before
a chair slid across the floor.

773
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:41,217
I keep seeing visions of witches
popping up everywhere but...

774
01:14:43,253 --> 01:14:46,555
you know, it's...
it's just normal stuff.

775
01:14:46,557 --> 01:14:49,193
OMG, Rachel, she's coming
for you.

776
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:51,260
Oh.

777
01:14:51,262 --> 01:14:52,927
No, it makes sense,
you said yourself

778
01:14:52,929 --> 01:14:54,796
you don't know why she left you
this house.

779
01:14:54,798 --> 01:14:57,668
She wanted you here
when she died.

780
01:15:00,303 --> 01:15:01,404
Okay...

781
01:15:02,137 --> 01:15:04,640
look, I'm not saying
that couldn't be a possibility,

782
01:15:04,642 --> 01:15:08,612
but I'm really just trying
to help out my family right now.

783
01:15:09,512 --> 01:15:11,145
You know,
my dad just lost his job

784
01:15:11,147 --> 01:15:13,883
and I'm trying to stay strong
by staying here.

785
01:15:14,784 --> 01:15:16,350
I don't wanna make things
worse by telling them

786
01:15:16,352 --> 01:15:17,721
I'm seeing ghosts.

787
01:15:19,255 --> 01:15:21,491
Yeah, I can understand that.

788
01:15:22,493 --> 01:15:24,893
Besides, you'd need some sort
of flare anyway for her

789
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:27,498
to be able to enter your body.
So you should be safe.

790
01:15:28,331 --> 01:15:29,898
A flare?

791
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,603
Yeah. See, it's here
in the book.

792
01:15:33,803 --> 01:15:36,604
In order for the spirit
to possess another body,

793
01:15:36,606 --> 01:15:38,172
the living has
to be wearing some sort

794
01:15:38,174 --> 01:15:39,640
of flare from the deceased,

795
01:15:39,642 --> 01:15:43,110
like an heirloom or something,
like a broach, a ring...

796
01:15:43,112 --> 01:15:44,481
A necklace?

797
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:49,686
- She did not leave you that too.
- Yeah.

798
01:15:50,053 --> 01:15:52,323
They gave it to me
at the reading of her will.

799
01:15:53,857 --> 01:15:57,225
Flare is, sort of, like, a
paranormal GPS tracking system.

800
01:15:57,227 --> 01:16:00,097
So she can find you
when she needs you.

801
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,502
Okay.

802
01:16:05,701 --> 01:16:08,403
Well, um, I guess
as long as dead people

803
01:16:08,405 --> 01:16:10,570
don't start turning up
with missing body parts,

804
01:16:10,572 --> 01:16:12,877
I should be okay.

805
01:16:14,578 --> 01:16:15,780
Right.

806
01:16:18,647 --> 01:16:21,815
Okay. Wow,
so my grandmother was a witch

807
01:16:21,817 --> 01:16:25,388
and she wants to possess
my body... awesome.

808
01:16:37,734 --> 01:16:40,737
You know,
maybe I better take this off.

809
01:16:42,338 --> 01:16:43,907
Just to be safe.

810
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:50,080
Doesn't really go
with anything I wear.

811
01:17:02,124 --> 01:17:04,462
- That was awkward, wasn't it?
- Yes!

812
01:17:07,196 --> 01:17:09,396
God, why would he kiss her?

813
01:17:09,398 --> 01:17:11,366
I mean, what could he
possibly see in her?

814
01:17:11,368 --> 01:17:13,303
I don't know, Tristen,
maybe he...

815
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:15,537
maybe he just likes her.

816
01:17:15,539 --> 01:17:17,372
Just likes her?

817
01:17:17,374 --> 01:17:20,177
Why would he settle for that
when he could have this?

818
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:30,918
Look, you know
that's like looking at an elbow

819
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:33,322
for me, right?

820
01:17:33,589 --> 01:17:36,960
Look, forget about her.
What are we gonna do tonight?

821
01:17:37,727 --> 01:17:39,594
Um, I think me
and the girls are gonna go

822
01:17:39,596 --> 01:17:42,898
to a real bar and proceed
to get shit hammered.

823
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:45,199
That sounds like a lot of fun.
I'll buy the first drink.

824
01:17:45,201 --> 01:17:47,534
Sorry, Tyson,
only real girls allowed.

825
01:17:47,536 --> 01:17:49,270
No queens on tonight.

826
01:17:49,272 --> 01:17:51,641
Now, can you go lock up
while I finish changing?

827
01:17:53,476 --> 01:17:55,212
Sure, great.

828
01:17:56,346 --> 01:17:57,380
Okay.

829
01:18:24,275 --> 01:18:26,110
Bitch.

830
01:19:05,914 --> 01:19:07,950
Tristen? Tristen!

831
01:19:08,986 --> 01:19:11,188
I want to have a little talk
with you.

832
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:14,258
Tristen?

833
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:32,076
Oh my god.

834
01:22:44,234 --> 01:22:45,636
Maggie?

835
01:22:57,847 --> 01:22:59,315
Maggie?

836
01:23:08,592 --> 01:23:10,093
Maggie?

837
01:23:24,139 --> 01:23:25,642
Maggie?

838
01:23:48,798 --> 01:23:50,032
Hello?

839
01:26:34,429 --> 01:26:35,499
Who's there?

840
01:26:42,437 --> 01:26:43,472
Hello?

841
01:26:45,307 --> 01:26:46,509
Who is that?

842
01:28:03,052 --> 01:28:04,286
Andy?

843
01:28:16,531 --> 01:28:19,069
Mom? Dad?

844
01:28:26,107 --> 01:28:27,476
What's going on?

845
01:29:25,602 --> 01:29:26,934
Rachel!

846
01:29:26,936 --> 01:29:28,502
Jesus, Maggie.

847
01:29:28,504 --> 01:29:31,639
- Oh my god, Rachel, it's my mom.
- What's going on?

848
01:29:31,641 --> 01:29:33,607
I went home after I left here

849
01:29:33,609 --> 01:29:35,442
and I didn't think
anyone was there at the house,

850
01:29:35,444 --> 01:29:38,748
- it was so dark.
- Maggie, what happened?

851
01:29:39,714 --> 01:29:43,319
I found my mom. Sh... she's dead.

852
01:29:45,454 --> 01:29:48,454
Someone killed her.
She was bleeding everywhere

853
01:29:48,456 --> 01:29:51,794
and her ear was cut off.
It was just like the ritual.

854
01:29:52,661 --> 01:29:53,860
Oh my god, Maggie, come on.

855
01:29:53,862 --> 01:29:55,731
Let's go, we have to get help,
come on.

856
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,033
Okay. So, look, my parents
aren't here.

857
01:30:00,035 --> 01:30:01,570
I was looking for them
before you came over.

858
01:30:01,838 --> 01:30:04,971
What are we gonna do?

859
01:30:04,973 --> 01:30:06,308
Mom?

860
01:30:17,719 --> 01:30:20,056
Mom, are you down here?

861
01:30:38,574 --> 01:30:40,543
- Hello?
- Rachel, it's Kevin.

862
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:42,176
<i>Kevin?</i>

863
01:30:42,178 --> 01:30:44,080
<i>Yeah, it's Tyson
and Tristen.</i>

864
01:30:45,681 --> 01:30:47,780
- <i>They've been killed.</i>
- Wait, what happened?

865
01:30:47,782 --> 01:30:50,050
<i>I... I don't know.
I was coming by Crave</i>

866
01:30:50,052 --> 01:30:51,788
<i>and I saw them.</i>

867
01:30:53,121 --> 01:30:54,588
Oh my god.

868
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:57,256
Yeah, I'm waiting on the cops
and my dad to get here.

869
01:30:57,258 --> 01:30:59,659
Kevin. Kevin, listen to me.
Maggie's here. She said

870
01:30:59,661 --> 01:31:02,063
- her mom's been killed too.
- <i>What?</i>

871
01:31:02,065 --> 01:31:04,200
And I can't find
my family either.

872
01:31:04,534 --> 01:31:06,065
<i>Rachel, you need
to get out...</i>

873
01:31:06,067 --> 01:31:08,804
Kevin?

874
01:31:09,938 --> 01:31:11,141
Kevin!

875
01:31:16,544 --> 01:31:17,746
What is it?

876
01:31:18,447 --> 01:31:21,584
It's Tristen and Tyson.
They're dead.

877
01:31:23,085 --> 01:31:25,454
Oh my god, we have to get
out of here, let's go.

878
01:31:26,923 --> 01:31:27,958
Hey.

879
01:31:29,625 --> 01:31:30,826
What is that?

880
01:31:49,478 --> 01:31:52,548
- Rachel, don't.
- It's fine, come on.

881
01:32:49,705 --> 01:32:51,173
This can't be real.

882
01:32:52,174 --> 01:32:54,576
It's the ritual to Lumiru.

883
01:32:56,879 --> 01:33:00,984
It's Kevin.

884
01:33:08,624 --> 01:33:11,661
- What's going on?
- Dad?

885
01:33:17,566 --> 01:33:20,536
- What are you doing?
- Oh, thank god you're here.

886
01:33:21,004 --> 01:33:23,570
M... Mr. Dunn, we need your help.
My mom...

887
01:33:23,572 --> 01:33:25,275
Did you touch anything?

888
01:33:26,542 --> 01:33:28,945
What? Uh...

889
01:33:29,911 --> 01:33:31,981
No. Why?

890
01:33:36,953 --> 01:33:38,087
Good...

891
01:33:38,887 --> 01:33:41,657
It took me awhile
to get this all set just right.

892
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:45,660
It's almost done...

893
01:33:46,227 --> 01:33:49,731
except for one small piece.

894
01:33:52,767 --> 01:33:53,969
Dad?

895
01:33:58,941 --> 01:34:02,612
All I need now is a nose...

896
01:34:03,913 --> 01:34:06,482
and the puzzle will be complete.

897
01:34:08,217 --> 01:34:11,121
Dad, what is this about?

898
01:34:13,222 --> 01:34:14,491
What is this?

899
01:34:16,225 --> 01:34:19,092
You detectives should
already know, right?

900
01:34:19,094 --> 01:34:20,195
Know what?

901
01:34:20,862 --> 01:34:23,530
That your friend there,
that's the one that gave you

902
01:34:23,532 --> 01:34:26,936
all the detes on the ritual,
right?

903
01:34:27,468 --> 01:34:32,609
- In grandmother's book?
- Yes, in grandmother's book.

904
01:34:34,610 --> 01:34:37,810
See, I told you I was
gonna fix your closet door.

905
01:34:37,812 --> 01:34:39,014
Remember?

906
01:34:39,315 --> 01:34:42,817
You said that it wouldn't close
at dinner and I told you

907
01:34:42,819 --> 01:34:44,887
that I would fix it.

908
01:34:45,687 --> 01:34:48,320
<i>Well, I went up to your room</i>

909
01:34:48,322 --> 01:34:50,424
<i>but you and your friend
were sitting on the bed</i>

910
01:34:50,426 --> 01:34:52,525
<i>having this little chat
about some ritual</i>

911
01:34:52,527 --> 01:34:53,993
<i>in the Book of Shadows.</i>

912
01:34:53,995 --> 01:34:55,929
<i>She was trying
to complete the ritual.</i>

913
01:34:55,931 --> 01:34:58,933
<i>The only problem was it has
to be performed</i>

914
01:34:58,935 --> 01:35:01,335
<i>on living sacrifices.</i>

915
01:35:01,337 --> 01:35:03,769
<i>I was listening a little
too intently</i>

916
01:35:03,771 --> 01:35:07,109
<i>because I almost gave myself
away when I leaned in too clos.</i>

917
01:35:15,351 --> 01:35:16,652
Whoops.

918
01:35:19,355 --> 01:35:22,090
Dad, what is this all about?

919
01:35:22,758 --> 01:35:25,161
It's about the perfect plan.

920
01:35:25,794 --> 01:35:31,198
Albertha, your grandmother,
my mother didn't leave me

921
01:35:31,200 --> 01:35:35,204
anything in the will,
absolutely nothing.

922
01:35:36,338 --> 01:35:42,211
You got it all, money,
the house, the estate.

923
01:35:43,079 --> 01:35:44,746
She gave it all to you...

924
01:35:45,647 --> 01:35:49,918
and then I heard Angela Lansbury
here talking about this ritual

925
01:35:50,186 --> 01:35:53,186
and I had an idea of how
to get everything back.

926
01:35:53,188 --> 01:35:54,522
Mr. Dunn.

927
01:35:54,856 --> 01:35:56,792
Picture it, if you will,

928
01:35:57,159 --> 01:36:03,432
poor little bug-eyed outcast
girl Maggie... has no friends.

929
01:36:03,865 --> 01:36:06,902
She hates her life.
She hates her mom.

930
01:36:07,169 --> 01:36:09,203
She wants to be someone else.

931
01:36:09,471 --> 01:36:11,971
Along comes new girl Rachel.

932
01:36:11,973 --> 01:36:15,509
She's awesome
and her family's great

933
01:36:15,511 --> 01:36:18,078
and she has a cool new
boyfriend.

934
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:22,918
OMG, Maggie is just totes jelly
of Rachel.

935
01:36:23,518 --> 01:36:26,252
So, she gets
this witchcraft book

936
01:36:26,254 --> 01:36:28,823
and discovers this ritual,

937
01:36:28,825 --> 01:36:31,561
how to take over
someone else's body.

938
01:36:32,428 --> 01:36:36,598
So she needs five victims
to make it work.

939
01:36:36,865 --> 01:36:38,467
So, what does she do?

940
01:36:39,267 --> 01:36:44,172
She kills her mother
for an ear, slice,

941
01:36:44,472 --> 01:36:46,607
and then she kills
the two coffee shop employees

942
01:36:46,609 --> 01:36:49,243
that were picking on her
for a hand, chop,

943
01:36:49,245 --> 01:36:51,144
and a tongue, slice,

944
01:36:51,146 --> 01:36:54,116
and then she kills
her friend's mother

945
01:36:54,749 --> 01:36:57,286
for an eye, chop.

946
01:36:58,887 --> 01:37:01,622
And now she just needs
one last piece

947
01:37:01,624 --> 01:37:03,426
to complete the ritual.

948
01:37:05,261 --> 01:37:06,428
A nose.

949
01:37:07,062 --> 01:37:12,768
So... she decides to kill Rachel
for her nose.

950
01:37:13,736 --> 01:37:18,107
I mean, it's a cute nose.
Am I right?

951
01:37:19,475 --> 01:37:21,176
So how does this end?

952
01:37:21,642 --> 01:37:25,412
Well, Rachel's father
was working really late.

953
01:37:25,414 --> 01:37:27,782
You see, he just got
this brand-new job

954
01:37:27,784 --> 01:37:29,985
and is trying to make a good
impression with the boss.

955
01:37:30,285 --> 01:37:35,858
So, he comes home and discovers
bug-eyed crazy girl

956
01:37:36,392 --> 01:37:38,661
has killed his wife
and daughter...

957
01:37:39,495 --> 01:37:41,427
and has this witchcraft thing

958
01:37:41,429 --> 01:37:43,833
set up in the basement
for some ritual.

959
01:37:45,668 --> 01:37:48,371
They struggle
and he stabs her...

960
01:37:49,004 --> 01:37:50,206
in self-defense...

961
01:37:51,206 --> 01:37:54,176
and he gets his
daughter's inheritance.

962
01:37:54,677 --> 01:37:58,313
Why? Because it's the law

963
01:37:58,780 --> 01:38:02,047
and it's the one loophole
that old Albertha didn't think

964
01:38:02,049 --> 01:38:06,489
about and now he's the only one
that's alive.

965
01:38:08,690 --> 01:38:10,493
What about Andy?

966
01:38:12,495 --> 01:38:16,366
Well, someone has to carry
on the Dunn name.

967
01:38:17,999 --> 01:38:21,935
Dad, please. Take the house,
take the money, anything.

968
01:38:21,937 --> 01:38:23,872
I don't want it,
you can have it.

969
01:38:24,673 --> 01:38:29,712
Eh... it's too late for that,
Rach.

970
01:38:31,347 --> 01:38:33,316
Look at all these body parts.

971
01:38:40,388 --> 01:38:41,958
What was that?

972
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:57,539
Who's under there?

973
01:38:59,941 --> 01:39:01,209
Andy?

974
01:39:01,744 --> 01:39:03,713
Is that you, sport?

975
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:08,918
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Come on out.

976
01:39:27,736 --> 01:39:30,373
Come out, come out.
Wherever you are.

977
01:39:37,445 --> 01:39:38,647
Andy?

978
01:39:42,351 --> 01:39:43,652
Come on out.

979
01:39:45,253 --> 01:39:48,857
I'm not gonna hurt you,
you know that, right?

980
01:40:03,105 --> 01:40:04,507
Andy?

981
01:41:13,475 --> 01:41:15,444
It's the fifth sacrifice.

982
01:41:17,713 --> 01:41:21,150
It's complete, Rachel.

983
01:41:23,384 --> 01:41:25,053
The ritual is complete.

984
01:41:27,522 --> 01:41:29,723
Guys!

985
01:41:29,725 --> 01:41:33,126
- Kevin!
- Rachel. You okay?

986
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:37,098
Yeah, I'm fine, I... I just need
to get out of here.

987
01:41:57,752 --> 01:42:00,052
Andy!

988
01:42:00,054 --> 01:42:02,021
Rachel, I was stuck
in there.

989
01:42:02,023 --> 01:42:03,524
Oh my god, what were you doing
in there?

990
01:42:03,526 --> 01:42:05,091
I was hiding and I got stuck.

991
01:42:05,093 --> 01:42:08,263
- I was so scared, Rachel.
- Oh, come here.

992
01:43:02,817 --> 01:43:06,155
You sure you want to leave?
You never started your job.

993
01:43:08,123 --> 01:43:10,793
Yeah. I, um, put in my notice.

994
01:43:11,459 --> 01:43:14,295
- What are you gonna do now?
- Live.

995
01:43:18,467 --> 01:43:20,169
Hey, Rachel,
this is the last one.

996
01:43:20,669 --> 01:43:21,704
Okay.

997
01:43:26,275 --> 01:43:29,645
I'm really gonna miss you.
So cliché, right?

998
01:43:30,745 --> 01:43:31,947
Yeah.

999
01:43:34,682 --> 01:43:35,717
Me too.

1000
01:43:44,124 --> 01:43:45,160
What is it?

1001
01:43:45,995 --> 01:43:48,095
You know, I know
that my dad killed those people

1002
01:43:48,097 --> 01:43:51,701
and... I know why he did it,
but...

1003
01:43:53,035 --> 01:43:54,937
I experienced things...

1004
01:43:55,536 --> 01:43:57,740
I saw things in that house
that I...

1005
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:00,242
I know wasn't him.

1006
01:44:01,843 --> 01:44:04,012
I just feel like there's more
to the story.

1007
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:08,450
Maybe, it's better not to know.

1008
01:44:12,353 --> 01:44:13,388
Yeah.

1009
01:44:14,388 --> 01:44:15,623
You're probably right.

1010
01:44:18,026 --> 01:44:21,429
Well... I better go.

1011
01:44:21,896 --> 01:44:22,897
Bye.

1012
01:44:23,831 --> 01:44:27,436
Don't be a stranger. I mean,
stranger than you already are.

1013
01:45:03,739 --> 01:45:06,605
She needs a little work
but she's a beauty

1014
01:45:06,607 --> 01:45:08,440
and the bones are all there.

1015
01:45:08,442 --> 01:45:12,110
Oh, it has such character.
I can't believe the price

1016
01:45:12,112 --> 01:45:14,583
- and what a cute little town.
- Yes, it is.

1017
01:45:14,816 --> 01:45:17,449
Now remember, everything's
included in the house,

1018
01:45:17,451 --> 01:45:21,220
the furniture, the appliances.
Everything you see, it's yours.

1019
01:45:21,222 --> 01:45:23,457
Wow. All right,
where's the kitchen?

1020
01:45:23,459 --> 01:45:24,994
Right around the corner.

1021
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:37,130
I can tell you it won't last
too long, not at this price.

1022
01:46:37,132 --> 01:46:39,599
Okay. Well, I definitely want
to put an offer in.

1023
01:46:39,601 --> 01:46:41,100
Could we do it right now?

1024
01:46:41,102 --> 01:46:43,368
Of course, I'll go to my car
and get the paperwork.

1025
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:44,373
Okay.

1026
01:46:49,311 --> 01:46:50,411
Honey?

1027
01:46:56,051 --> 01:46:58,020
Honey, are you upstairs?

1028
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:10,465
Honey?

1029
01:47:11,098 --> 01:47:12,634
Are you up there?

1030
01:47:22,677 --> 01:47:23,879
Honey?

1031
01:47:25,079 --> 01:47:27,582
There you are,
didn't you hear me calling you?

1032
01:47:30,919 --> 01:47:32,187
