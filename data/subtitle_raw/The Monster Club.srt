To get real nourishment,

we have to take our food

vampires, werewolves,
and ghouls.

122
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:04,788
Now, a vampire and a werewolf
would produce a werevamp,

123
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,835
but a werewolf and a ghoul
would produce a weregoo,

124
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:12,100
but a vampire and a ghoul
would produce a vamgoo.

125
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:15,669
A weregoo and a werevamp
would produce a shaddy.

126
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:18,889
Now, a weregoo and a vamgoo
would produce a maddy,

127
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:22,676
but a werevamp and a vamgoo
would produce a raddy.

128
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:26,854
Now, if shaddy were to mate
with a raddy or a maddy,

129
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:28,899
the result would be a mock.

- Not very likely.

176
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:44,861
- He's offering enough money.

177
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:47,995
Hmm?

178
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:50,824
Umbrick House.

179
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,042
[gentle music]

180
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:54,871
[birds chirping]

181
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:17,633
[bells jingling]

182
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,503
[tense music]

183
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,332
[shoes clicking]

184
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:30,602
[bells jingling]

185
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:46,793
Mr. Raven?

186
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:52,494
I'm Angela, Angela Jones.

187
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:55,715
I wrote to you about your
advertisement.

188
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,717
- Yes, of course, please do,
do come in.

189
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,854
My study is this way.

190
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:09,685
[clock chiming]

191
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,861
- So many things.

192
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:13,123
- They all have to be cataloged.

193
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,649
Before we begin, there's
something I must tell you.

194
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,912
Some people find me difficult,

195
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:22,045
um, impossible to work for.

196
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,830
- Why, do you beat up
your secretaries?

197
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,614
- No, nothing like that.

198
00:12:25,701 --> 00:12:28,704
I, I pride myself on being
a very easy taskmaster.

199
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,053
It's just.

200
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,143
[suspenseful music]

201
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,017
- I'm sorry.

202
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:39,628
[tense music]

203
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:00,736
I can't do it.

204
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,221
- [George] Why, did he
turn you down?

205
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:09,223
- He wanted me, all right,

206
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,617
and the house is full of good
stuff, but the way he looked,

207
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:14,750
there was something
terrifying about him.

208
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,101
- Full of good stuff?

209
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:19,407
- I'm not going back.

210
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:28,068
[tense music]
[bells jingling]

211
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:44,998
- You came back.

212
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:53,658
- Ooh, why don't you get
someone to clean this place.

213
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:54,572
- I can't.

214
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:59,012
I, I can't ask people
to come here.

215
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:01,623
You have no idea how
hard it was for me to,

216
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,190
to advertise for you.

217
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,017
- Why?

218
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,368
- Well, I must never
go near people.

219
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:11,981
I can never go outside
these grounds.

220
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:13,504
- Aren't you ever lonely?

221
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:15,202
[Raven chuckles]

222
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,247
- If only you knew the
agony of my loneliness.

223
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,338
Uh, some of my relation will
visit me from time to time,

224
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:22,905
but they're different.

225
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:25,386
- But why can't you go out?

226
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,956
- Well, there's all
the noise, the traffic,

227
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,655
I might--

228
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:34,830
- Might what?

229
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:40,880
[tense music]

230
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:45,536
[sullen music]

231
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:01,074
[tense music]

232
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,521
- I didn't mean to
frighten them.

233
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,264
- They're my only friends.

234
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,355
Soon, they'll, they'll
learn to get to know you.

235
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:25,011
Soon, they'll accept
you as a friend.

236
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:29,580
- Well, I must get to work.

237
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:41,244
- I've always been fascinated
by the things of the dead.

238
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,638
[sullen music]

239
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,729
It's probably something
to do with my ancestry.

240
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:49,209
And the living have always.

241
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:58,609
[peaceful music]

242
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:01,961
I used to wear a mask once,

243
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:07,923
but it was no use.

244
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:10,360
It just made people curious.

245
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:14,451
They had to see what was
underneath, and then,

246
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,804
much better to get over the
shock right at the beginning.

247
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:21,719
Then they might even
grow accustomed.

248
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:10,986
You should always have
flowers, masses of flowers.

249
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,562
You should always be
surrounded with flowers.

250
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:28,003
- The birds will expect
their breakfast.

251
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,352
- Oh yes, yes, you're right.

252
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,180
I mustn't neglect my
other friends.

253
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:35,924
You have no idea what
meeting you has meant to me.

254
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:47,805
- What are you playing at?

255
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,677
What's going on?

256
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:54,595
- Let's forget it, chuck
the whole thing in.

257
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:56,205
- Are you afraid of him?

258
00:17:56,292 --> 00:17:59,948
You said yourself he was a
weakling, what can he do?

259
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:01,384
- I don't know.

260
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:04,822
- Look, at least get
hold of something,

261
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:07,999
so I can see what sort of
stuff he's go, get it valued.

262
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,044
- I don't like it!

263
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,526
- You in love with him
or something?

264
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:15,181
- No.

265
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,879
He terrifies me.

266
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:22,188
And yet.

267
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:26,366
[peaceful music]

268
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:41,120
[tense music]

269
00:18:56,874 --> 00:18:57,701
- No!

270
00:19:22,726 --> 00:19:24,293
[Raven whistling]

271
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,166
[Angela screams]

272
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:35,086
[tense music]

273
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:45,184
[Raven panting]

274
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:48,187
[Raven whimpering]

275
00:20:21,742 --> 00:20:25,093
- This sort of stuff's
almost impossible to fence.

276
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,747
It's too specialized,

277
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,096
and we'd need a ton of
it for the meltdown value

278
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:29,880
to be worth anything at all.

279
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,447
- So, we give up?

280
00:20:31,534 --> 00:20:33,101
- No.

281
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,755
We've invested too much
to chuck it in now.

282
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:36,539
- But it is no use.

283
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,846
- He almost certainly pays
for that stuff in cash.

284
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:42,110
He must have a safe
somewhere to keep it handy.

285
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:43,633
Probably keeps some of the small

286
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,200
really valuable
articles in there too.

287
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:48,943
Has he come out of his room yet?

288
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,249
- I haven't seen him for days.

289
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,557
- Good, then you'll have
plenty of opportunity

290
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:55,689
to look for the safe.

291
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,955
[gentle music]

292
00:21:37,992 --> 00:21:40,734
[birds chirping]

293
00:21:57,794 --> 00:22:00,319
[gentle music]

294
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,337
- Angela, look.

295
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,645
It used to belong to
Princess Sahuya.

296
00:22:22,732 --> 00:22:24,430
She was said to be the most
beautiful woman of her day.

297
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,301
That was some 3,000 years ago.

298
00:22:29,086 --> 00:22:30,653
Sahuya must have had
your coloring.

299
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:36,964
It matches your eyes,
your skin, beautiful.

300
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,412
[lock clicking]

301
00:22:59,943 --> 00:23:03,251
- You should keep all
those things in the bank.

302
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:04,513
- Oh.

303
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,515
I don't like banks.

304
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,996
You have to see people.

305
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:14,610
No, my things are much better

306
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:17,483
here with me.

307
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:23,924
Angela, will you marry me?

308
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:32,454
Well, I realize my
appearance and everything,

309
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:37,459
but you could still love me.

310
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:43,117
- But we've got it all planned.

311
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:46,425
[Angela sobbing]

312
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:47,687
- I can't do it to him.

313
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:52,866
- Oh, don't worry,
everything will be all right.

314
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:54,084
Just remember the plan.

315
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,000
Play along with him.

316
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:00,656
Get him to give you the ring
as an engagement present,

317
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:06,967
and then remember the
combination
when he opens the safe.

318
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:09,099
- Oh, you've made me so very,
very happy.

319
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,102
Of course, you may
have the ring.

320
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:16,498
It's only fitting it
should adorn

321
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:18,761
a living hand after so
many centuries.

322
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:24,463
And such a beautiful hand.

323
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:30,294
[Raven panting]

324
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:35,212
I, I have something of a
confession I must make to you.

325
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:37,084
I am a, a shadmock.

326
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:40,479
I don't suppose you
know what that is.

327
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,396
If I ever whistle,

328
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:49,879
well, I must never whistle,

329
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:52,012
no matter what happens.

330
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:03,980
Oh, you must meet some
of my relations.

331
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:05,286
They can explain the
situation to you

332
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,853
much better than I ever can.

333
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:14,295
We could have a party,
an engagement party.

334
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:15,775
It can be in fancy dress.

335
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:20,954
Everyone can wear masks.

336
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:24,261
My relations are a bit
much to take all at once.

337
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:25,524
That way, you can have a chance

338
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:27,090
to get used to them gradually.

339
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:29,789
- I like dressing up.

340
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:32,182
- Well, in spite of my
relations,
in spite of everything,

341
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,664
you could still love me.

342
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:39,799
[peaceful music]

343
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:02,517
It is a crime to hide
such beauty,

344
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:04,127
but here we must all be masked.

345
00:26:31,938 --> 00:26:36,290
My love, may I present
my Great Uncle Uriah.

346
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:37,726
Great Uncle, may I present

347
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:40,294
my bride to be, Miss
Angela Jones.

348
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:20,943
[dramatic music]

349
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,772
[peaceful music]

350
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:56,849
[light orchestral music]

351
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:29,985
[Angela screams]

352
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:45,435
The money and the other things,
they don't matter to me.

353
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:46,349
Take them.

Perhaps, he's hiding.

never been there.

He might wake up early
and play with you.

01:15:31,135 --> 01:15:33,572
But I, may I be forgiven,

895
01:15:34,747 --> 01:15:36,575
did implore mercy for
the creature.

896
01:15:37,881 --> 01:15:41,624
I took it into my house
and washed away the filth,

897
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:43,103
filth, the like of which

898
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:45,715
I had never before in
my life beheld.

899
01:15:47,064 --> 01:15:50,720
I clad it in clean raiment
and laid it on soft bed.

900
01:15:52,025 --> 01:15:54,854
Where did I sin, merciful God?

901
01:15:54,941 --> 01:15:58,641
For should we not succor the
afflicted, give good for evil?

902
01:16:00,599 --> 01:16:04,690
Then one night when the
moon was full, I saw it.

903
01:16:04,777 --> 01:16:08,738
Cursed be the eyes that
see, the ears that hear,

904
01:16:08,825 --> 01:16:14,526
feeding in the churchyard,
mud on the hands,

905
01:16:14,613 --> 01:16:17,921
sitting on a pile of earth
and gnawing, gnawing.

906
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:23,230
We chased it away, but
for the one we drove away,

907
01:16:23,317 --> 01:16:27,713
12 did return, and they danced
around the village bounds

908
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,194
to mark the place for their own.

909
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:32,979
[haunting music]

910
01:16:49,996 --> 01:16:53,130

hear the howls.

[tense music]

912
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:00,877
- [Innkeeper] Luna.

913
01:17:05,098 --> 01:17:05,925
Luna.

914
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,670
- No.

915
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:12,671
No.

916
01:17:12,758 --> 01:17:13,585
No, no!

917
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:32,909
[ghouls hissing]

918
01:17:45,182 --> 01:17:47,706
[eerie music]

919
01:17:56,236 --> 01:17:58,282
Dada beat me because I help you.

920
01:17:58,369 --> 01:17:59,457
I not go back.

921
01:17:59,544 --> 01:18:01,720
If you go, Luna be left here.

922
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:05,593
- That's nonsense.

923
01:18:07,552 --> 01:18:10,337
When I escape, I want
you to go with me

924
01:18:10,424 --> 01:18:12,600
and live the life a
pretty girl should.

925
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:15,038
- You take me outside?

926
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:17,301
I wear clothes like yours?

927
01:18:27,006 --> 01:18:31,097
You really take me outside
and ride on underground?

928
01:18:31,184 --> 01:18:32,620
- Underground?

929
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,535
What do you know about
the underground?

930
01:18:34,622 --> 01:18:37,016
- Elders say there is much
good eating underground.

931
01:18:37,103 --> 01:18:38,539

933

Stone kill if hit head.

934
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:54,686
They caught many
animals that way.

935

937
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,145
- What will their next trick be?

938
01:19:19,232 --> 01:19:20,843
- Nothing more.

939
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:23,323
They wait for elders to
come for great eating.

940
01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:24,890
Elders not like us.

941
01:19:24,977 --> 01:19:26,022
Have much wisdom.

942
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:28,981
No escape when elders are here.

943
01:19:29,939 --> 01:19:31,810
- When will they come?

944
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:32,855
- This night.

945
01:19:32,942 --> 01:19:35,858
[suspenseful music]

946
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:58,184

stay beside me.

[tense music]

949
01:20:16,507 --> 01:20:17,856
- Follow, follow.

950
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:19,945
And stop them.

951
01:20:20,032 --> 01:20:22,948

[Luna panting]

962
01:21:56,824 --> 01:21:57,738
Back broke.

963
01:21:58,652 --> 01:22:01,481
Like when Dada hit rabbit.

964
01:22:03,396 --> 01:22:05,529
Rabbit die soon when back broke.

965
01:22:07,792 --> 01:22:08,793
I die soon.

966
01:22:13,363 --> 01:22:14,886
Never see outside.

967
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:18,672
Never wear pretty clothes.

968
01:22:18,759 --> 01:22:20,761
- I'll go and get some help.

969
01:22:20,848 --> 01:22:22,459
You'll be all right.

There's a village, there's a
village up there, a village of.

973
01:23:17,557 --> 01:23:20,082
Well look, if you'll take
me to the police station.

976
01:24:03,255 --> 01:24:04,735
Where are you going?

977
01:24:04,822 --> 01:24:05,953
This is the way to the.

978
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,348
Stop!

979
01:24:09,435 --> 01:24:10,915
- Don't worry, sir, we saw.

980
01:24:12,003 --> 01:24:13,787
The supply wagon will
take care of it.

981
01:24:13,874 --> 01:24:14,962
- Supply wagon?

982
01:24:15,876 --> 01:24:17,226
- It's just behind that car.

983
01:24:19,402 --> 01:24:22,144

984
01:24:26,278 --> 01:24:27,845

- Well, it would make a
good story, wouldn't it?

993
01:25:15,501 --> 01:25:17,503
I mean, it's so moral.

994
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:19,679
No nudity, no sex,

995
01:25:19,766 --> 01:25:22,029
a little violence perhaps,
but [chuckles].

996
01:25:22,117 --> 01:25:23,509

997

liking to you.

998

- But you promised.

999
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:31,038
- Oh, no, no, no, I'm going
to put you up for membership.

1000
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,128
- But I'm not a monster.

1001
01:25:33,215 --> 01:25:35,739

greatest monster of them all.

[secretary grumbling]

1003

Oh, Mr. Club Secretary, I
want to propose my friend here

1004
01:25:40,918 --> 01:25:43,921
as a member of this
august assembly.

1005
01:25:44,008 --> 01:25:46,663
- But he's a, he's, he's a hume!

1006
01:25:50,057 --> 01:25:54,105
- Yes, but can we truly
call this a Monster Club

1007
01:25:54,192 --> 01:25:56,281
if we do not boast
amongst our membership

1008
01:25:56,368 --> 01:25:58,544
a single member of
the human race?

1009
01:25:58,631 --> 01:25:59,458
- [Monster] Nonsense!

1010
01:25:59,545 --> 01:26:01,634
[monsters yelling]

1011
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:03,245
- [Monster In Green Dress]
What can he do?

1012
01:26:03,332 --> 01:26:04,985
- What can he do?

1013
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:07,901
In the past 60 years,

1014
01:26:07,988 --> 01:26:14,038
humes have exterminated over
150 million of their own kind.

1015
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:17,824
No effort has been spared to
reach this astronomical figure,

1016
01:26:17,911 --> 01:26:20,523
and the methods that
they have used

1017
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:23,830
must demand our
unstinted admiration.

1018
01:26:23,917 --> 01:26:25,658
You know, humes began

1019
01:26:25,745 --> 01:26:27,747
with certain very serious
disadvantages,

1020
01:26:27,834 --> 01:26:31,490
but these they overcame
with wonderful ingenuity.

1021
01:26:31,577 --> 01:26:33,927
Not having a fang or a claw,

1022
01:26:34,014 --> 01:26:36,495
oh, or even a whistle
worth talking about,

1023
01:26:36,582 --> 01:26:41,283
they invented guns and tanks
and bombs and airplanes

1024
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:45,417
and extermination camps
and poison gas and daggers

1025
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:48,507
and swords and bayonets
and booby traps

1026
01:26:48,594 --> 01:26:51,249
and atomic bombs and
flying missiles,

1027
01:26:51,336 --> 01:26:56,820
submarines, warships, aircraft
carriers, and motorcars.

1028
01:26:56,907 --> 01:26:59,866
They have even
perfected a process

1029
01:26:59,953 --> 01:27:03,043
whereby they can spread a
lethal disease

1030
01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:06,046
on any part of this planet,

1031
01:27:06,133 --> 01:27:09,354
not to say anything about
nuclear power. [laughs]

1032
01:27:09,441 --> 01:27:11,400
Oh, during their short history,
you know,

1033
01:27:11,487 --> 01:27:14,316
humes have subjected
other humes to death

1034
01:27:14,403 --> 01:27:19,799
by burning, hanging,
decapitation, strangulation,

1035
01:27:19,886 --> 01:27:24,456
electrocution, shooting,
drowning, crushing,

1036
01:27:24,543 --> 01:27:27,242
racking, disemboweling, hmm,

1037
01:27:28,373 --> 01:27:31,637
and other methods far,
far too revolting

1038
01:27:31,724 --> 01:27:35,554
for the delicate stomachs
of this august assembly.

1039
01:27:35,641 --> 01:27:40,733
- I never realized he
was so talented.

1040
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:42,213
- We don't like to boast.

1041
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,607
- I second the proposal.

1042
01:27:44,694 --> 01:27:49,873
A member of such a talented race

1043
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:54,399
can only be a credit to
any Monster Club.

1044
01:27:54,486 --> 01:27:56,488
