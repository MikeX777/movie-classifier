1
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,201
Hydrangeas.

2
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:05,206
What?

3
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:06,703
Yamato pork!

4
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,210
"Watarase".

5
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,603
It's on time.

6
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:11,472
Over there! There!

7
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,018
﻿This seat is hard.

8
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,989
﻿But the breeze feels so good.

9
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,031
﻿This seat is hard!

10
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,500
What?

11
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,197
﻿You're enjoying in your own world?

12
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:40,234
﻿I thought we're enjoying
﻿the ride in our own way.

13
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:48,868
﻿Having fun?

14
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:51,048
﻿Does this give you a reggae vibe too?

15
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,051
﻿Get out of here, man!

16
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,450
﻿You're using that term wrong!

17
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,757
-Mr Kodama, you're amazing.
-﻿Your mind's always on your work.

18
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,160
﻿That's right.

19
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,730
﻿This train car is also built
﻿from the things we make.

20
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,773
All right.
﻿Let's enjoy the ride together.

21
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,417
Look, there's the ravine.

22
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:22,179
Ravine?

23
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,056
﻿Back off!

24
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:27,508
—It's lovely!
﻿—What a view!

25
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,551
﻿Get out of my way!

26
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,366
I'm getting off.

27
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,699
﻿But there won't be another train in an hour.

28
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:17,300
﻿"Train Brain Express"

29
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:28,443
All trains are currently suspended.

30
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,392
﻿This is bad.

31
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,527
﻿But it'll be all right.

32
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,193
﻿It'll be all right.

33
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,365
﻿You're not worried? Why?

34
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,338
﻿Come with me. I'll help you out.

35
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,981
﻿We're near Kitasenju.

36
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,718
﻿What pretty flowers! They're gerberas.

37
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,951
﻿But it's so early...

38
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,586
﻿They come on the first train from Chiba.

39
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:14,725
﻿Maybe I'll buy some.

40
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,265
﻿Please do.
﻿The station's straight ahead.

41
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,450
﻿Don't be so standoffish.

42
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,060
﻿You picked me out from the crowd.

43
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,048
Cross here for Kitasenju Station.

44
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:36,443
﻿Make it this far,
﻿and you can go anywhere.

45
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:10,514
﻿"Kodama Iron Works Factory"

46
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:19,194
Here you go.
﻿Make sure you chew properly.

47
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:33,842
Mr Kodama, I enjoyed the train ride.
﻿﻿Thank you.

48
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:38,350
﻿Next time. I want to head for Hanshin.

49
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,346
﻿I love Kansai!

50
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,513
﻿You can't make the trip in a day.

51
00:05:43,173 --> 00:05:45,513
Maybe you'd rather work there?

52
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,819
﻿No, we won't leave, Mr Kodama.

53
00:05:49,112 --> 00:05:51,219
We'll take you to Kansai with us.

54
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,220
What do you say?

55
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:59,462
When you get used to things,
﻿you'll have to come here by yourselves.

56
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,536
﻿You want to save some time
﻿for your girlfriend?

57
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,165
﻿I don't have one. What I mean is...

58
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:10,008
﻿we have other staff,
﻿and they all work hard.

59
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:14,082
﻿They buy lunch with the money they earn.

60
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,484
﻿Please don't say anything more.

61
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,588
﻿We got it. Right, Yukari?

62
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,026
﻿Thank you for paying.

63
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,553
﻿We won't be a burden to you, Mr Kodama.

64
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,966
﻿All right, then.

65
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,201
﻿First of all, let's hear from Kaiji.

66
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,646
﻿Are they about five centimetres?

67
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,981
﻿No, more than that.

68
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,086
﻿Yeah, they're about
﻿nine and a half centimetres.

69
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,619
﻿Aren't they ten centimetres?

70
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:57,561
﻿The Tama River has ten centimetres carp,
﻿so we can build there.

71
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,060
﻿Why all the carp talk?

72
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,125
﻿Adjacent high-rise buildings
﻿in the suburbs...

73
00:07:03,456 --> 00:07:08,099
﻿could affect wind flow and the ecosystem.

74
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:12,438
﻿I know, but it's the same
﻿for all developments.

75
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:18,240
﻿It's our task to create units
﻿with stunning high-rise view.

76
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,848
﻿We have other tasks too.

77
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:26,355
﻿Like reviving factory towns...
﻿and regional development.

78
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:30,059
﻿The countryside's
﻿a wasteful investment now.

79
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:32,621
Go to the Coldplay concert...

80
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:37,025
﻿return to your riverside apartment
﻿and unwind with a glass of wine.

81
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,796
﻿That's the ideal city life.

82
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:42,668
﻿Am I right, Komachi? Be honest!

83
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,274
﻿Not for me.

84
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,310
﻿I've never really thought about my lifestyle.

85
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,114
﻿He's right, Kaiji.

86
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,213
﻿Everyone has his or her own lifestyle.

87
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:00,382
﻿For me, I love having coffee milk
﻿in a sauna most.

88
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,793
﻿The financing application fell through.

89
00:08:06,793 --> 00:08:10,393
﻿They refuse to loan us seventy million yen.

90
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:15,270
﻿If Kitashinagawa Bank won't,
﻿then who will?

91
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,569
﻿It's tricky.

92
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:22,369
With new machines and our skills,
﻿we could make anything.

93
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:24,112
Did they mention about laying off staff?

94
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:28,083
﻿Yeah, they even drew up their own plan.

95
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:32,815
﻿But we don't do that to our staff.

96
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,655
﻿We can cut iron,
﻿but can we cut people too?

97
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,459
﻿Kodama, it's okay to fire us.

98
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,800
﻿Don't say that!
﻿Your future is still ahead of you.

99
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,573
Do we still have a future?

100
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:57,481
﻿Don't worry.
﻿If we keep the cost down, we'll all be fine.

101
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,178
﻿Let's go.

102
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,812
Really?

103
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,985
﻿So we live close by.

104
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,820
﻿That's great. Can I drop by
﻿if I run out of something?

105
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,824
﻿But I don't have any cologne.

106
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,960
﻿You don't? Times must be hard.

107
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,871
It's not that.

108
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,736
I only said that because it's
﻿more amusing than saying soy sauce.

109
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:27,105
﻿You don't have to explain.

110
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,443
﻿Anyway, what's your hobby?

111
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,883
﻿To be honest... I love trains.

112
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,520
﻿Taking trains, enjoying the scenery
﻿and listening to music.

113
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:43,959
﻿By the way, I caught a weird train
﻿on a work trip to Fukui.

114
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,494
"The Bread Train"?

115
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,895
—What's that?
—﻿I never heard of it before.

116
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,098
﻿You pick up on the train, but not my job?

117
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,362
﻿So you sell glasses?

118
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,839
﻿Let me know if you need any.
﻿Even if it's just for cosmetic use.

119
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,990
No 3D glasses?

120
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,917
﻿I'll like trains too, trust me.

121
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,689
﻿Trust you?

122
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,395
I﻿t's okay, it's okay.

123
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,830
Huh? What's okay?

124
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,062
﻿—A martini please.
﻿—Sure.

125
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,301
﻿—Shaken more than usual.
﻿—Yes, Ma'am.

126
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,897
﻿Don't worry. I'll pay for my share.

127
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,077
﻿I hate being treated.

128
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,383
﻿Well?

129
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,480
H﻿ow is it so far?

130
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,664
﻿You like me, don't you?

131
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:41,435
Here we go, it's Parlata Kamata's
﻿famous "handkerchief drop."

132
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:47,874
﻿Who will our butterfly of the evening,
﻿Momiji, descend upon?

133
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,879
﻿Will she drop her handkerchief,
﻿or her heart?

134
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,284
﻿She's made her choice!

135
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,119
﻿Will he catch Momiji in time?

136
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,158
﻿He caught her!

137
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:13,473
﻿This kid doesn't take after me,
﻿He's super-restrained.

138
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,942
He is!

139
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:20,880
﻿You can't come to a place like this
﻿after what happened today, he said.

140
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,044
Like this? Poor baby.

141
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,883
That's not what I said!

142
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,253
﻿But he's a point, it's a bit odd.

143
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,186
﻿Listen, her name's Benibana.

144
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,723
﻿Introduce me to one of your
rich customers.

145
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:37,061
﻿Your boyfriend will do.

146
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,501
﻿Well, what exactly do you guys make?

147
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,596
﻿At our factory, we weld iron...

148
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,807
Hello, gentlemen!

149
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,307
﻿—This is Akebono.
—﻿Not the sumo wrestler though.

150
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,907
﻿I'm skinny, but they call me Akebono.

151
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:52,909
﻿Nice to meet you!

152
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:57,248
﻿Miss Akebono...
﻿please be his girlfriend.

153
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,953
This is ridiculous.

154
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,064
﻿We haven't even talked yet?

155
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:10,531
﻿Even a place like this has rules.

156
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:13,567
Anyway, how many carats
 is your necklace?

157
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,403
- What?
- That's my son.

158
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,474
How many carats is that dress?

159
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:18,540
What?

160
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,508
You're so silly!

161
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,405
He's funny!

162
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,851
﻿I understand how you feel.

163
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,951
﻿Yes, everyone feels the same...

164
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,557
I'm very sorry!

165
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,690
﻿What a mess!

166
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:42,663
﻿A defect has been found
﻿in the piping of this building...

167
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:45,894
﻿so it's going to be rebuilt.

168
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:47,669
So?

169
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,702
﻿You can't be here when it's torn down.

170
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,234
What?

171
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,078
﻿So when do you want me out?

172
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,878
﻿As soon as possible.

173
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,383
﻿Where will you go?

174
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:09,524
﻿I'll wait it out in Kitakata.

175
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,655
Oh, Kitakata...

176
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,692
﻿It's famous for the
"SL Banetsu Monogatari Express".

177
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,358
﻿Most people would say
﻿it's famous for ramen noodles.

178
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,562
﻿I wish I'd known you earlier!

179
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,266
﻿It would have made living here
﻿more fun.

180
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,034
What a shame.

181
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,770
﻿So you'll move out, right?

182
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,650
﻿How is it?

183
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,989
﻿Excuse me, would you mind jumping?

184
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,254
Oh, ok.

185
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:48,320
﻿A little higher.

186
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,534
﻿Two or three times more.

187
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,443
﻿Got it, Thanks.

188
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:18,789
﻿Well, that's about it.

189
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,756
﻿You work in real estate, don't you?

190
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,266
﻿What? No...

191
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,082
﻿Hi there.

192
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,554
﻿Hi there!

193
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,756
﻿Oh. hello.

194
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,994
﻿We met on the Watarase Line.

195
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,099
﻿You were with a cute girl.

196
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,402
﻿What happened to her after that?

197
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,373
You were with those reggae guys.

198
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,639
﻿It looked like you were having fun.
I ﻿envied you.

199
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:16,179
﻿Surely you're not taking a trip
﻿on this train too?

200
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,412
﻿No, it's not a trip...

201
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,450
but not a commute either.

202
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,489
﻿They even call it "Train View".

203
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:33,164
﻿It means you can watch trains
﻿from your window.

204
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,800
I see.

205
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,350
﻿There are homes built
﻿with that concept in mind, right?

206
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,643
Yes, there are.

207
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,677
﻿I work for Nozomi Estate.

208
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,246
﻿Why do you need
﻿to look for an apartment then?

209
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:52,411
﻿I can't relax in my company's units.

210
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,900
﻿That place has a great train view.

211
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,158
﻿Let's take a look.

212
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,334
﻿Please, take a seat.

213
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:24,445
﻿Many people avoid such places
﻿due to the noise, but I like it.

214
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,119
﻿The Utsunomiya Line runs first
﻿in the morning...

215
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,056
...at about 5:15 am.

216
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,286
﻿Over there is the Tohoku Bullet Train.

217
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:38,557
﻿Even just watching it in summer
﻿cools me down.

218
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,006
﻿What music do you listen to then?

219
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,601
﻿﻿I don't need music.

220
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:51,906
﻿The motor sound of an EF510
﻿pulling a Hokutosei train is enough.

221
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:55,553
﻿I understand.

222
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,353
﻿Made from Kawasaki Heavy Industries iron.

223
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,427
﻿It would go well with
﻿Milt Jackson's vibraphone.

224
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:11,599
﻿The tune is...
"Softly, As In A Morning Sunrise".

225
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:15,335
﻿I've never thought of it that way.

226
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,371
﻿I'm quite impressed.

227
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,874
﻿One of our staff quit, so...

228
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:29,069
﻿I appreciate it.

229
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:33,449
﻿I know nothing about iron but...
thanks for the room.

230
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,525
In exchange...

231
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,594
...you can teach my son
﻿the tricks of your trade.

232
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,721
﻿He's never been outside of Kamata.

233
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,198
﻿I ride trains on weekends.

234
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,496
﻿But you never meet girls.

235
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,195
﻿Do you know any nice girls?

236
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,103
﻿There must be plenty in Marunouchi.

237
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,902
﻿Well, um... nice girls?

238
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,343
﻿I don't know about that either.

239
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:01,383
﻿Then let's visit the
﻿Kamata and Oimachi hostesses.

240
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,681
﻿We'll have a party!
My son's too timid.

241
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:10,385
﻿Dad! Don't blurt out my weaknesses.
﻿It's not fatherly.

242
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,131
﻿Excuse... you?

243
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,667
﻿It should have been us to leave.

244
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,239
﻿We're sorry, boss.

245
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:28,072
You must take home with you
﻿your knowledge.

246
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,441
﻿You can't make a single bolt yet, can you?

247
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:31,840
Neither can I.

248
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:35,942
﻿—You don't need to.
﻿—﻿You've got great off-spec smarts.

249
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,253
﻿Like an advance investment.

250
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:40,886
﻿—Now. about the hostesses...
﻿—Dad!

251
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,454
Papa!

252
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,618
﻿Even after 5:00 pm, he's still our boss!

253
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,594
﻿Darn, I licked my pencil.

254
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,530
﻿—What time...?
﻿—Dad!

255
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,334
﻿—Mr Komachi! Good morning.
﻿—Good morning, Midori.

256
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:01,603
﻿I took the subway exit you told me about...

257
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,680
...﻿so I made the concert on time.

258
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,248
You're better than GPS.

259
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,477
﻿—I'm flattered.
﻿—It's all I'm good at.

260
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,645
You're good at being yourself.

261
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,719
﻿Is that a compliment?

262
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,517
Oh... no.

263
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,094
﻿I guess it is.

264
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,593
I understand.

265
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:30,464
﻿But President... ﻿hitting under 100
﻿on that course was superb.

266
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,732
﻿Never mind my score.

267
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,473
﻿The clubhouse's fried prawns...

268
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:39,581
﻿...were puffy and not properly cooked.

269
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:44,176
P﻿resident, perhaps ordering seafood
﻿in the mountains was a bad idea.

270
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:48,181
﻿That's true. My mistake.

271
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,659
Come in.

272
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,257
Excuse me.

273
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,961
﻿—Good morning.
﻿—Morning.

274
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,603
﻿These are the minutes
﻿from the last meeting.

275
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:08,340
﻿Someone's against high-rise buildings?

276
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,977
Yes, that's Komachi Kei
﻿in planning division.

277
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,083
﻿High-rise apartments
﻿are our flagship enterprise.

278
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,220
﻿How could he oppose them?

279
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,990
﻿I admire his guts.

280
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:24,359
Did he know that senior management
﻿would see this?

281
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,724
﻿I believe so.

282
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,830
﻿He might be well-suited for
our venture project.

283
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:56,390
﻿It's all due to a footbridge
﻿overlooking the Keikyu tracks.

284
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,158
﻿Some nights,
﻿I just stood there until I got sleepy.

285
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,992
﻿Yeah, that's it.

286
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:08,433
﻿If it hadn't been nearby, I don't know
﻿if I'd have become a train fan.

287
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:13,542
Did you obsess over
﻿train spec differences?

288
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,111
﻿Yeah, my dad taught me.

289
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,408
﻿The 800 series had a higher gear ratio...

290
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,850
...﻿to cover short distances
between stations.

291
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,716
﻿I knew that too.

292
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:31,721
I ﻿was surprised to see Inokashira
﻿trains on the Asanogawa Line.

293
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,757
﻿Of course they were second-hand...

294
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:38,262
﻿but the stations are close together...

295
00:22:38,623 --> 00:22:42,230
﻿so Inokashira Line trains
﻿were a perfect fit.

296
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,317
﻿You listen to music
﻿on the train, don't you?

297
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:03,260
﻿Isn't a mix of natural sounds,
﻿the train, and the tracks better?

298
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:07,756
﻿That will indeed be
﻿a purer travel experience...

299
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:12,201
﻿...but I enjoy it in my way.
Music sets me apart.

300
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,767
You know, there are so many train fans.

301
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:19,039
﻿So I want to do something
﻿that suits my style.

302
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,567
Your style?

303
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:26,342
Yes. ﻿I tried to find my style
 somewhere else.

304
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:27,905
﻿Where was that?

305
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:33,187
﻿The Thunder Dolphin coaster
﻿at Tokyo Dome City.

306
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,324
I ﻿was listening to Led Zeppelin's
﻿"Immigrant Song."

307
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,027
﻿I nearly died.

308
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,740
﻿I think I know what you mean.

309
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,015
﻿I'd like to try that too.

310
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,417
﻿What turned you on to trains?

311
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:10,089
﻿Well... ﻿This may sound trite...

312
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,856
﻿but it was the transport museum.

313
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,856
﻿I went with a school friend...

314
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:21,264
﻿and was moved that people actually
﻿ride these wonderful machines.

315
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,138
﻿—I get you...
﻿—I thought you would.

316
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,117
﻿I see. I see.

317
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,682
﻿I'm a train fan too.

318
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,849
﻿Of station meals, I should say.

319
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,885
﻿Which ones are the best?

320
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,356
﻿Let me see...

321
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,691
﻿Lately the Miyajima eel meal,
﻿the Imabari eel meal...

322
00:24:53,683 --> 00:24:57,204
﻿and the Takamatsu eel meal
﻿have gotten tastier.

323
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,173
﻿That's a lot of eel.

324
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,691
﻿Eels...

325
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:04,165
they electrify.

326
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:15,488
﻿Mr Kodama...
﻿that was a pun, wasn't it?

327
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:20,923
﻿Ah, you caught me by surprise!
﻿That's quite rare.

328
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:24,431
﻿Anyway, please reconsider our loan.

329
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:30,807
﻿I think you know our capabilities,
﻿so why isn't it possible?

330
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:39,914
﻿For years, ﻿our bank prioritised
﻿know-how over collateral...

331
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:43,318
﻿because of our prior president.

332
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,981
﻿But starting from this year,
﻿we have a new president.

333
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,959
﻿Please understand.

334
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:57,590
﻿Personally, I wish I could help
﻿your company more.

335
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,962
﻿So that's how it is.

336
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:11,628
﻿Like this...
﻿keep turning it, don't stop.

337
00:26:11,878 --> 00:26:12,880
Yes.

338
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,478
﻿Right, that's it.

339
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,820
﻿Boss, how about me?

340
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:23,185
﻿Sure, let me see.

341
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:27,329
﻿Look, do it as you turn it.

342
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,163
﻿—Yes.
﻿—Like that.

343
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,596
﻿That's it.

344
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:41,169
﻿Next one is 120kph.
﻿A Keikyu Rapid Express.

345
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,275
"﻿Excuse me!".

346
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,276
﻿You meant to say "okay," right?

347
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,979
﻿Yukari, this is a Yoyogi-Shinjuku
﻿Yamanote train, a slow ball.

348
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:55,520
﻿Get out of here!

349
00:26:57,388 --> 00:26:58,857
The train's faster!

350
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,996
﻿Acty, here's your favourite,
﻿a Hanshin train.

351
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:09,197
﻿A Sannomiya-Umeda Limited Express.
﻿Top speed 110kph!

352
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,341
﻿Just like Hanshin. It's fast!

353
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:47,675
<i>﻿About metres ahead, turn left.</i>

354
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,109
<i>﻿Next, turn right.</i>

355
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,614
<i>﻿You've reached your destination.</i>

356
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,008
﻿Can I help you?

357
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,322
﻿This is Kodama Iron Works, right?

358
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:05,053
﻿Well, today's Sunday. We're closed.

359
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,320
﻿I came to visit...

360
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:12,528
﻿Oh, I see! That's nice.

361
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:15,934
﻿He'll be playing catch
﻿down by the Tama River.

362
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:18,371
What should I do then...?

363
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,972
﻿Don't say a word.
﻿I know everything.

364
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:28,278
﻿I'm Kodama Tetsuo, Kenta's father.
﻿I own the iron works.

365
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,736
﻿I'll show you the way.

366
00:28:32,915 --> 00:28:33,840
Follow me.

367
00:28:47,692 --> 00:28:50,696
﻿See those two playing catch?

368
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:55,235
﻿They could play anywhere
﻿on this narrow riverbank...

369
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,343
...﻿but they only go there.

370
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,743
Call them naive or just ignorant.

371
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,643
A﻿nyway, go give them hell.

372
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,317
﻿Come on, don't be shy.

373
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,900
﻿Kenta, what are you doing?

374
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,987
﻿She came all the way to see you.

375
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,323
﻿You came for Komachi,
﻿and Dad got the wrong idea.

376
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,691
﻿That sounds like something he'd do.

377
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:50,492
﻿He's good with iron, but not with women.

378
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,902
﻿That applies to me too.

379
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,734
So where's Komachi?

380
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,535
﻿He's looking for an apartment again.

381
00:30:03,668 --> 00:30:05,944
﻿He can't stay with us forever.

382
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,310
﻿That's true.

383
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,481
﻿He told me he wanted to stay forever.

384
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:14,886
﻿Really? ﻿Is that true?

385
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,020
﻿What's up?

386
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:31,306
I think you should
﻿consider her feelings more.

387
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:36,371
﻿But I'm not her. I don't know.

388
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,206
﻿How so?

389
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:44,114
﻿For instance, what was she wearing?

390
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,849
﻿A cute flowery dress, I think.

391
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,028
﻿Would you wear it?

392
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,319
﻿Why say that?

393
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,156
﻿I'm not into that.
﻿Don't get the wrong idea.

394
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:02,567
I﻿'m just saying that we can't understand
﻿how women feel after all.

395
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:09,343
﻿Like when we first met,
﻿I was with a girl, remember?

396
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,839
﻿She dumped me after that.

397
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:15,718
﻿She said I like trains more than her.

398
00:31:16,304 --> 00:31:19,145
﻿Women and trains aren't the same.

399
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,000
﻿Is that so?

400
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,790
﻿Maybe there were other reasons...

401
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,791
﻿but if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.

402
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,763
﻿The girl is pretty though.

403
00:31:31,456 --> 00:31:35,871
﻿She must like you very much
﻿to come all the way here.

404
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:51,817
﻿Good morning, Komachi.
﻿Found a place yet?

405
00:31:51,943 --> 00:31:53,980
﻿Good morning. It's not easy.

406
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,490
﻿But it's fun to look for one.
﻿You know what I mean?

407
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,494
﻿Actually, I know a great place
﻿in Shirogane.

408
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,329
﻿Only 100,000 yen for employees.

409
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,198
﻿Shirogane Landscape House?

410
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:17,706
﻿It's close to shops,
﻿and with Sheraton Hotel spa access.

411
00:32:17,706 --> 00:32:20,547
﻿—﻿Are you impressed?
﻿—No trains though.

412
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,792
﻿Oh gosh, don't you know?

413
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:25,645
﻿There's the Namboku subway line.

414
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,556
﻿But you can't see it, or hear it.

415
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,220
﻿Oh, I love the Tokyo Metro.
﻿It's a great shortcut through town.

416
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,062
﻿You don't say.

417
00:32:42,931 --> 00:32:43,807
Midori?

418
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:46,171
Coming.

419
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,040
Yes?

420
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:56,548
﻿Did you tell Komachi
﻿about that special vacancy?

421
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,984
﻿Yes, I just met him in the lobby.

422
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:03,052
﻿—And?
﻿—He turned it down flat.

423
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:06,500
﻿Really? He turned it down?

424
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,532
I﻿'m glad. He doesn't need
﻿a place in Tokyo anymore.

425
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,895
﻿What do you mean?

426
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:19,568
﻿You've got a thing for him, right?

427
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:25,414
﻿I like him... a little.

428
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,625
﻿Komachi, found a place yet?

429
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,197
﻿Not yet.

430
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:47,167
﻿Good.
﻿It might be for the best.

431
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,402
﻿It may rain this evening.

432
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:54,175
Look.

433
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:58,074
For 315 yen a month,
﻿you can check the weather radar.

434
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,273
﻿It's accurate.

435
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:04,742
﻿Have you got an umbrella?

436
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:09,358
﻿Chief, please say what you need to say.

437
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,852
﻿Never mind the weather.

438
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,900
﻿Well...

439
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,158
﻿Komachi, you've been
﻿transferred to Kyushu.

440
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:24,005
﻿They have problems with some
﻿leisure projects and apartments...

441
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:28,099
so they want a fresh pair of hands.

442
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,940
﻿I'm sorry... ﻿Will you go?

443
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:35,975
﻿To Kyushu?

444
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,717
﻿I've always wanted to go!

445
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,755
﻿Komachi, it's not a vacation.
﻿You act so pleased.

446
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,260
I know!

447
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:51,528
It's the gateway to Asia!
﻿It will be a challenge!

448
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:55,736
﻿I didn't know how you'd take it.
﻿I was gambling a bit.

449
00:34:56,494 --> 00:35:00,838
﻿But never mind the job,
﻿won't the move be a problem?

450
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:02,000
﻿A problem?

451
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,374
Not at all! I'll do my best!

452
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,781
What about your girlfriend?

453
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,647
No problem.
﻿That's for the best too.

454
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:17,487
﻿This is great.

455
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:38,910
﻿Actually, I've been posted to Fukuoka.

456
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,013
Fukuoka?

457
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:47,478
﻿Is that... good or bad?

458
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,449
﻿To me, it's good.

459
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,923
It's Kyushu.
﻿I can ride the trains there.

460
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,964
﻿I see.
﻿Nothing fazes you, right?

461
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:03,462
﻿But isn't working in Tokyo
﻿the main line to success?

462
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:08,035
﻿Well, the main line...

463
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,511
﻿In Keio terms,
I'm on the Keibajo Line.

464
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:15,447
﻿In Keikyu terms,
 that'd be the Daishi Line.

465
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,820
﻿It's good that you take pride in your work.

466
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,900
﻿—I don't have any.
﻿—That's not true.

467
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,621
﻿You're cool. You'll be a hit in Kyushu.

468
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,561
﻿It will be good for you.

469
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:03,757
Komachi.

470
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,725
Oh, Midori.

471
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,164
﻿What a coincidence to meet you here.

472
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:16,110
﻿What a shame... I'm not here by myself.

473
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,440
﻿Oh, am I interrupting?

474
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,178
﻿Not at all.

475
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:22,807
﻿You're awful.

476
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,386
﻿This is my mother, Inaho.

477
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,224
﻿I'm Komachi.

478
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,984
﻿Midori and I work in the same company.

479
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:44,105
﻿Oh, isn't Inaho the name of
﻿the Niigata-Akita express?

480
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:48,368
﻿Isn't the Tokyo-Akita bullet train
﻿called Komachi?

481
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,172
﻿That’s right.

482
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,682
﻿You two, please!

483
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,861
﻿Was the bookstore fun?

484
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,234
﻿Yes, I haven't bought
﻿so much books in a while.

485
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:21,104
﻿I'd buy them online.
 Books are heavy.

486
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:26,039
﻿Are you feeling unwell?
﻿You're in a bad mood.

487
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,514
﻿Why did you call me so late?

488
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:32,804
﻿Not a good time, is it?

489
00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:34,382
You’ll be angry.

490
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,891
I won't.
﻿There's nothing between us anyway.

491
00:38:37,682 --> 00:38:39,161
﻿There's no reason to get angry.

492
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,298
﻿So you figured it out.

493
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:48,898
﻿I did.

494
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,496
﻿You're marrying her.

495
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:52,800
﻿Who?

496
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,608
﻿You seem honest,
so her mom likes you too.

497
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,040
﻿Wait, you've got it wrong.
I'll explain.

498
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,708
﻿Sure, let's hear it.

499
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,674
﻿I'm moving to Fukuoka.

500
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,500
﻿You can't...

501
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,122
﻿I'll be so lonely!

502
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:30,268
﻿That's a demotion.
﻿Did you do something wrong?

503
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:36,011
﻿It's okay. You can work your way back.

504
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:41,417
﻿I guess.
﻿I think it's a good thing.

505
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,194
﻿We'll be far apart, but
﻿only five hours by bullet train.

506
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,361
﻿It's just an hour or so by plane,
silly you!

507
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:22,861
Komachi!

508
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,762
﻿Welcome!

509
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,303
﻿Are you tired? You're fine?

510
00:40:51,315 --> 00:40:54,489
﻿I didn't expect you to come, sir.

511
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:58,259
﻿We're on a bad streak here in Kyushu.

512
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:00,528
﻿Everyone has to get stuck in.

513
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,401
﻿I was the only one free.

514
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:10,505
﻿A few people are transferred here
﻿from Tokyo...

515
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,739
﻿but you are the first one
﻿to come by bullet train.

516
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:18,052
﻿You either love bullet trains,
﻿or you take it easy.

517
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:22,255
﻿It's both.
﻿I love all kinds of trains.

518
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:32,992
﻿Welcome to Nozomi Estate Hakata's
﻿best staff apartment.

519
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,631
﻿It overlooks the whole bay.

520
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:50,118
﻿It has a great view,
﻿and the bay is beautiful.

521
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,482
﻿It will be better if there's a seaside line.

522
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:12,301
﻿For me, this is the sea.

523
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:18,379
When I was a kid, I would take
﻿the train here to air my loneliness.

524
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:22,418
﻿You never told me that before.

525
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,750
﻿—Have we been here before?
﻿—We did!

526
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:32,728
﻿I had to tell you so many times
﻿that this isn't a beach!

527
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,491
﻿Actually, I come here sometimes too.

528
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,256
﻿Really? Is that so?

529
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:45,487
﻿Like father, like son.

530
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:57,813
﻿If only we had new machines...

531
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:11,664
﻿Loan us some money!

532
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:18,865
﻿Don't follow me.

533
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,440
﻿I'm thinking about dinner.

534
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,873
﻿Nothing but recipes.

535
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,574
<i>﻿Loan us some money!</i>

536
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:11,500
﻿This is our hitman from Tokyo,
﻿Komachi Kei.

537
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,585
﻿Please make him feel welcome.

538
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:21,016
﻿I'm Komachi Kei. Well...

539
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:26,198
﻿I'll work hard to support
﻿Nozomi Estate in Kyushu.

540
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:31,272
﻿I have a lot to learn, but I'll do my best!

541
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:38,046
﻿Watch out for Nakasu babes!

542
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:43,883
﻿I like riding trains while
﻿enjoying music and the scenery.

543
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:45,890
﻿Just so you know.

544
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,788
Try the Hitahikosan Line.

545
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:49,729
﻿Who said that?

546
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:55,933
﻿Now that introductions are over,
﻿let's start our morning exercises.

547
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,404
﻿It will limber up your mind too.

548
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:21,224
﻿She's exercising?

549
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:42,411
﻿This works wonders
﻿on my poor old shoulders.

550
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,152
President...

551
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,824
﻿did you take hyaluronic acid yesterday?

552
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:51,255
﻿Of course not!

553
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,055
Only Peking Duck and jellyfish soup.

554
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,289
﻿It must be the collagen then!

555
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:57,796
﻿You look radiant.

556
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:01,095
﻿Your beauty brings me joy.

557
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:06,341
﻿Did Komachi take the Hakata
﻿apartment without a hitch?

558
00:46:06,994 --> 00:46:10,770
﻿I know him.
﻿He'd like to choose for himself...

559
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,437
but he's in no position to.

560
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:16,176
﻿Plus, that unit would be wasted on staff.

561
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,090
﻿But the occupancy rate's only 70%
﻿despite the setting and fixtures.

562
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:24,419
﻿That seems to be a problem.

563
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:27,422
That's why I wanted him to move in.

564
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:31,761
﻿As a monitor, his criticism
﻿would be most convincing.

565
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,036
﻿—I'm Oki.
﻿—I'm Taku.

566
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,332
﻿—I'm Kamiyamada.
﻿—I'm Kirishima.

567
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,207
—He's cute.
﻿—Yes, he is!

568
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,171
﻿I'm Ariake.

569
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:50,202
﻿People in Tokyo won't understand...
﻿but flattering words don't work here.

570
00:46:50,227 --> 00:46:51,605
﻿Hard work is the key.

571
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:56,684
﻿But you'll come to enjoy it.
﻿Let me take you out at night.

572
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:00,226
﻿Thanks, but I'm not a night person.

573
00:47:01,051 --> 00:47:03,429
﻿We work all day just to enjoy the night.

574
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,829
﻿Take the midnight sun
﻿in Scandinavia for example.

575
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:08,536
﻿The nights never end.

576
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,343
﻿I'm Kumagawa.

577
00:47:14,229 --> 00:47:16,143
﻿So you're from Tokyo.

578
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:19,212
﻿I want to go to Tokyo.

579
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:25,323
﻿Will you fly there?
﻿Or take the bullet train?

580
00:47:25,526 --> 00:47:27,002
﻿Or you prefer bus?

581
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,380
Anyway, nice to meet you.

582
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:33,988
﻿I'm Nichirin.

583
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,824
﻿I'll show you our problem.

584
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:42,500
﻿It's not our fault though.

585
00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:44,802
﻿The head office makes the decisions.

586
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:46,839
We're here just to clean up.

587
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:49,372
Ti﻿mes are bad too....

588
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:51,445
...but we're doing our best.

589
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:56,016
﻿—You and Nichirin can go take a look.
﻿—Okay.

590
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:14,134
That'd be a good spot for the industrial site.

591
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,227
We were eyeing for it too.

592
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:22,935
But the landowner's really stubborn
and wouldn't listen to us.

593
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,259
﻿What's your hobby, Nichirin?

594
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:46,993
﻿Soccer, I guess.

595
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:48,865
What position?

596
00:48:48,992 --> 00:48:49,993
Goalkeeper.

597
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:53,804
﻿You surprised me.

598
00:48:55,933 --> 00:49:00,075
﻿Once, I saved a free kick
﻿by Cristiano Ronaldo.

599
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:03,550
﻿You're talking about video games?
﻿Now I get you.

600
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,947
Actually, I played as
﻿Nakamura Shunsuke once too.

601
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,388
﻿You play video games too?

602
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,627
﻿They can be surprisingly useful for work.

603
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:16,091
﻿I play them to forget about work.

604
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:19,598
﻿By the way,
﻿is this place completely dead?

605
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,202
We haven't built anything yet...

606
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:24,602
...﻿but we bought it at a knockdown price.

607
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,835
It's a good buy, but...

608
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,604
﻿You're saying it right.

609
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,513
﻿At night, this place looks like
﻿a scene from Resident Evil.

610
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,874
Resident... Evil!

611
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,481
﻿Have you got a split personality?

612
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:51,824
﻿What’s this place supposed to be?

613
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,563
﻿It should have been Hot Shots Golf...

614
00:49:56,593 --> 00:50:00,234
﻿but I guess it turned into
﻿Nobunaga's Ambition.

615
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:07,798
Nichirin! Nichi!

616
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,181
﻿Are you okay?

617
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,249
Komachi...

618
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:29,094
﻿It's not often to see
﻿a small matchmaking party like this!

619
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,935
﻿Isn't this all for you?

620
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,599
﻿Don't tease your father, Kenta.

621
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:38,335
﻿Your father and I were on the
﻿school council in junior high.

622
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:46,919
﻿Actually, I used to work
﻿at a hostess club in Hiratsuka.

623
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:51,716
﻿Now I have a real estate license
﻿and I can support my mother.

624
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:56,456
﻿I'm impressed.
﻿How did you find time to study for it?

625
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,928
﻿Let's not talk about the past.

626
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,569
﻿We both love hostesses.

627
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:05,403
I...

628
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:07,670
It's not good to go there.
﻿But to work there is fine.

629
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:13,648
﻿What's your hobby?

630
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:18,412
﻿My hobby?
﻿Crystals, perhaps.

631
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,014
﻿Crystals?

632
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,821
﻿Not tourmaline or biotite?

633
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,624
﻿We'll leave you to it.

634
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,460
﻿Yes, let's eat.

635
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,036
﻿What's your hobby?

636
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,027
﻿Do you prefer driving to this?

637
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,867
﻿No, this is fun too.

638
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,300
﻿That's all?

639
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,300
﻿Are you upset?

640
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,699
﻿This is fun.
﻿If you were driving...

641
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,971
...﻿we couldn't do this.

642
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,990
﻿Ayame, I'll crash!

643
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:26,277
﻿—It's not a car.
﻿—No, my heart will crash.

644
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:28,000
﻿You're...

645
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,950
﻿more passionate than I expected.

646
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,387
﻿When I'm with the right guy...

647
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:41,164
﻿Tee hee hee, huh?

648
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:49,071
﻿It seems that... our heartbeats match
﻿the sound of the engine.

649
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,175
﻿What do you mean?

650
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:18,533
﻿I'm so tired!

651
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:25,037
﻿I haven't run uphill
﻿since elementary school.

652
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:27,009
﻿You seem fine though.

653
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,279
﻿It's lovely here. The air's fresh too.

654
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,523
﻿Let's eat over there.

655
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:40,622
﻿Sure.

656
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:46,893
﻿You did well to pick a spot
﻿in an area so spacious.

657
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,630
﻿The sun will sink into the west, right?

658
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,238
﻿In an hour, you'll see.

659
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,668
It will only be shining there.

660
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:01,805
﻿Have you ever thought of
﻿becoming a meteorologist?

661
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,250
Anyway, let's go.

662
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,036
﻿Did you make these?

663
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:29,174
﻿I did.

664
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:40,219
﻿What do you think of this
﻿riceball lunchbox?

665
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,000
Ayame...

666
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,300
It is amazing.

667
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:04,439
﻿Here you go.

668
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,540
﻿Thank you.

669
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,322
I'm so happy!

670
00:55:26,385 --> 00:55:27,338
It's delicious.

671
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,376
How was it? For Sonic Foods.

672
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:44,581
﻿Getting an appointment with
﻿the president's never easy.

673
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,388
﻿Even after all these years.

674
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:53,291
﻿I'm sure he'd take to
﻿a Kyushu native like you.

675
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,258
You couldn't get a chance to meet him?

676
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:58,797
﻿We could try bribes or women.

677
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:03,962
﻿By using a bait, he might bite.

678
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:08,534
﻿I'm sure he goes to
﻿the clubs in Nakasu too.

679
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:13,336
﻿The head office is on our backs
﻿regarding Sonic Foods.

680
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,247
﻿It's the only company
﻿around here that is doing well.

681
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:23,922
﻿If only they'd at least
﻿give us a chance to talk.

682
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:27,621
It's too bad.

683
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,722
﻿So, where's Komachi's report?

684
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:37,102
He's pointed out a problem
﻿with the hallway garbage chute.

685
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:43,043
﻿It's convenient, but the opening's small
﻿and it takes time to open it.

686
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,500
﻿The building itself is important...

687
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,017
but we need to pay attention
﻿to such details too.

688
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:53,954
﻿Also, we have a problem!

689
00:56:53,954 --> 00:56:55,954
﻿Our Kyushu branch says...

690
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,791
the president of Sonic Foods
﻿will meet us only if we go to him.

691
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:04,824
In other words, only if you go
﻿to Kyushu to meet him personally.

692
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:10,169
﻿He won't cross the Kanmon Straits
﻿to do business.

693
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:14,538
President!

694
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:17,040
﻿If he'll only meet with you....

695
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,943
..I think
﻿we should put away our pride and do it.

696
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,707
Our rivals...

697
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:24,978
Well, they don't
﻿have a female president...

698
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:29,700
﻿So that's it!
﻿He's probably just shy.

699
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,648
﻿Some motherly love might work.

700
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:34,720
Motherly or fatherly, whatever works.

701
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:38,664
We have no choice but to
﻿go to Hakata, I'll join you.

702
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:39,693
Midori!

703
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,501
We're scrambling
﻿from next Monday.

704
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,799
﻿So whatever comes up...

705
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,637
﻿Tokyo business
﻿takes a back seat, understand?

706
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,510
﻿Anyway, is Hakata blowfish
﻿still in season?

707
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:57,880
President, you can count on me
﻿for food and drink in Nakasu.

708
00:57:58,007 --> 00:58:01,296
﻿—Nakasu is your forte?
﻿—Yes. And for you...

709
00:58:01,507 --> 00:58:06,360
ingest lots of hyaluronic acid
﻿and collagen for your skin.

710
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:08,463
How about terrapin for dinner?

711
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:09,256
Terrapin!

712
00:58:09,385 --> 00:58:11,291
- ﻿That sounds great! I...
- You're not coming...

713
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:12,627
- No. I am...
- No.

714
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:15,968
﻿Has their president met Komachi?

715
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,265
﻿That's silly! Of course not!

716
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,099
﻿You like Komachi...

717
00:58:20,697 --> 00:58:22,904
﻿A little, yes.

718
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,594
﻿Here you go.

719
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:53,097
﻿This is hard for me to say...
﻿but our children can't get married.

720
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:55,398
﻿So Kenta is unsuitable.

721
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:59,537
﻿I think he's
a rare type these days though.

722
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:04,880
﻿No, he's a good person,
﻿which is why my daughter feels bad.

723
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:09,587
﻿During the time she quit hostessing
﻿and got her license...

724
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,693
﻿she was a man's mistress.

725
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,093
﻿She still works at his company now.

726
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:20,128
﻿Can't she end it?

727
00:59:20,128 --> 00:59:23,703
﻿That's why she decided
﻿to go through with the date.

728
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,200
﻿But Kenta...

729
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,235
﻿You might say that he lacks impact.

730
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,843
﻿Being a nice guy isn't enough for her.

731
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:38,152
Is that so?

732
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:43,581
﻿He's looking forward to
﻿their next date.

733
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:45,522
What a shame.

734
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,228
﻿Well...

735
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,256
﻿how about me?

736
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,025
As Kenta's wife?

737
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:55,568
No... ﻿yours.

738
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:03,440
﻿To tell you the truth...
I've had feelings for you since junior high.

739
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,515
﻿Are you serious?

740
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:16,478
﻿I... I can't forget my late wife.

741
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:20,826
﻿That's why I visit hostesses.

742
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,224
﻿Why don't you quit?

743
01:00:22,418 --> 01:00:26,332
﻿They... reinforce my iron.

744
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,402
﻿So I'm afraid marriage is...

745
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,310
﻿I'm finished.

746
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:43,974
﻿—Mother.
﻿—Don't call her that.

747
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:51,852
﻿Well, I'll remember you as
﻿a bite on my little finger.

748
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,352
﻿Excuse me.

749
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:04,702
—Say hi to Ayame for me.
﻿—That's enough.

750
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:10,033
<i>﻿This is Hakata Station.
﻿Thank you for travelling with us.</i>

751
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:21,741
﻿So you got a rail pass.

752
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,882
﻿No bullet trains. I envy you.

753
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,809
﻿Something to drink?

754
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:30,951
﻿Strawberry milk with condensed milk.

755
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,692
﻿Just kidding.
﻿Tea is fine.

756
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,200
Here you go.

757
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,509
﻿You’re kidding me.

758
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,957
﻿Milk helps to soothe a broken heart.

759
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:12,461
﻿You seem to see right through me.

760
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:16,773
﻿Sometimes, cheap things
﻿or spending time doing nothing...

761
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:18,860
bring peace to the heart.

762
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,036
﻿Isn't that wonderful?

763
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:24,836
﻿She turned me down.

764
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,138
﻿Honestly, this got me down.

765
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:30,849
﻿She was nice.

766
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,820
﻿I thought it was going well.

767
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,086
﻿Remember what I told you?

768
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:45,022
﻿Only women understand
﻿how women feel.

769
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:51,030
﻿It's best not to think about
﻿things you can't understand.

770
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:07,115
﻿It must have hurt you deeply.

771
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,247
﻿Really deep.

772
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:37,115
﻿What a great view.

773
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:45,458
﻿If only there's a seaside line.

774
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:27,267
﻿You love that, don't you?

775
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:33,467
﻿Music and scenery together...
﻿it's fantastic!

776
01:05:33,467 --> 01:05:34,904
You heard me?

777
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,906
﻿Then answer this.

778
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:43,182
﻿The sound of this KiHa E200
﻿on twenty-five meter rails...

779
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:45,411
﻿is it "gatan gatan..."

780
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:49,152
﻿or "darara darara...?"
dararara dara"?

781
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,951
﻿Don't you think it's interesting?

782
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:55,378
﻿Rather than being obsessed with
﻿what model this diesel train is...

783
01:05:55,581 --> 01:05:57,753
﻿or where it was made...

784
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,135
﻿I prefer to enjoy the view and the music.

785
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:04,129
﻿Sure, to each his own.

786
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:11,278
﻿But isn't it sad riding together
﻿without talking?

787
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:16,147
﻿Then you should have said so.

788
01:06:17,106 --> 01:06:22,078
﻿She still dumped me even though
﻿I did things her way.

789
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,000
So that's it.

790
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:31,121
﻿You're being true to yourself.
I get it.

791
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:42,776
﻿When you take a winding track...

792
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:46,144
﻿rather than walk straight ahead..

793
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:51,350
﻿it's less tiring to zig and zag, isn't it?

794
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:53,913
﻿That's the switchback method.

795
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,813
Switchback? T-back?

796
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,761
Chikugo, you are so knowledgeable!

797
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:06,889
﻿I'm a railfan.
﻿That kind of thing is like ABC to me.

798
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:12,133
﻿You won't read about that
﻿in the newspapers.

799
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,740
You won't...!

800
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,400
﻿They really should write about it.

801
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,812
﻿We can get out that way.

802
01:07:25,941 --> 01:07:28,500
﻿There it is...!

803
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,717
﻿It should be this way.

804
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:48,174
﻿It's... a C11...

805
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:52,810
No... there's an eighty-six there.

806
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:57,509
﻿I can't see a thing.

807
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,983
﻿Not a thing.

808
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:05,618
﻿No, I see it.

809
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,995
I can see it too.

810
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,567
﻿A shiny black locomotive!

811
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,534
Amazing.

812
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,472
﻿Would you mind taking a photo for us?

813
01:08:28,537 --> 01:08:30,039
﻿Here's the camera.

814
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,513
﻿Let's go there.

815
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:48,926
Thanks!
﻿Let me take yours too.

816
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:50,560
﻿—We're...
﻿—Yes. please.

817
01:08:59,558 --> 01:09:01,145
Smile!

818
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,791
﻿Do you guys always travel together?

819
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:16,956
﻿It's great to have a friend like that.

820
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:22,596
﻿You don't look like students.
﻿Where do you work?

821
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:25,529
﻿It's our day off.
﻿Let's not mention about work.

822
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:27,332
You're lucky with a girl on each arm.

823
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:33,746
﻿This is cheaper than taking them
﻿to eat at a swanky hotel.

824
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:36,940
﻿So you like trains?

825
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:37,710
Sí.

826
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,515
﻿That's an HO Scale Club gold badge!

827
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:45,519
You know it!
﻿You like model trains too?

828
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:49,460
﻿I've got no money to build them,
﻿but I know how.

829
01:09:49,652 --> 01:09:53,896
﻿No kidding! ﻿That's great!

830
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,872
﻿I'm Kodama from Kyushu Electric.
﻿Just kidding. Now, let's repair it.

831
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:38,278
﻿Your controller’s broken.

832
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:43,243
﻿The maintenance period's expired,
﻿and I've been busy at work.

833
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:48,020
﻿I haven't seen it working
﻿in a while. It's a shame.

834
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:51,251
﻿Knowledge of machines is an asset.

835
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:55,154
﻿He can tell you the model
﻿of a train just by listening.

836
01:10:56,452 --> 01:10:59,661
﻿He also knows the maker of
﻿any train.

837
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,458
It's not art.

838
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,900
﻿I've always wanted an HO scale.

839
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:07,704
﻿I could make one but not play with one.

840
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:11,072
﻿Here I go.

841
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:17,482
﻿Amazing! You're really good!

842
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:25,288
I﻿'ve got lots of other trains.
﻿Want to see?

843
01:11:25,414 --> 01:11:26,222
﻿Yes. please!

844
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:40,039
﻿This is amazing.

845
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,300
﻿You've got Keikyu too!

846
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,238
﻿He does!

847
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:52,118
﻿It's even a Keikyu 2000 series!

848
01:11:54,843 --> 01:11:56,914
﻿He's big fan of Keikyu.

849
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:59,552
﻿Seeing one at a crossing
﻿makes him tear up.

850
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,653
﻿The TCS connector's broken.

851
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:07,028
Luckily I have one with me.

852
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,432
﻿Now we'll have power.

853
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,006
﻿That's great! Thanks!

854
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:20,503
﻿Can we run the Keikyu
﻿and a Blue Train together?

855
01:12:22,871 --> 01:12:27,251
﻿The lines don't intersect
﻿like they do at Shinagawa though.

856
01:12:29,311 --> 01:12:32,520
﻿You know about that too? I'm moved!

857
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:34,889
﻿I saw the trains intersect once!

858
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,926
﻿I'm jealous!

859
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,858
﻿We'll never be able to see that again!

860
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,870
﻿I'll change the couplers.

861
01:12:52,801 --> 01:12:56,681
﻿Mr Chikugo, Kyushu Electric
﻿has restored power!

862
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:05,082
﻿Trains departing!

863
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:22,499
﻿Fantastic!

864
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:36,453
﻿It's coming...

865
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:39,857
﻿This is just grand...

866
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,184
﻿This is just grand.

867
01:14:24,264 --> 01:14:28,000
﻿"Fukuoka Airport Domestic Terminal"

868
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:31,772
﻿Welcome, ma'am...

869
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:34,441
Yufuin.

870
01:14:34,603 --> 01:14:37,777
You didn't make one
﻿of your pennants this time.

871
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:41,046
President, I have it right here!

872
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:46,587
﻿Let's head straight to Sonic Foods.

873
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:51,357
﻿President, before that, you have
﻿to partake of a hearty meal.

874
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:55,862
﻿First, you wolf down Goma saba
﻿with tea on rice at Tenjin.

875
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:59,730
﻿After that, you gulp down
﻿some ginseng tea.

876
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:02,874
﻿Then thirty minutes at a beauty salon..

877
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:05,103
﻿Ariake, do you know of a good salon?

878
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:09,341
﻿Hold on, you only know
﻿of that kind of salon.

879
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:20,415
﻿Most of the staff here are local people.

880
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:24,027
﻿However, they undergo rigorous training.

881
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:30,829
﻿Our president's concept is
﻿to keep the elite here in Kyushu...

882
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:35,536
so we usually don't have
﻿much to do with Tokyo.

883
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:39,976
﻿I'm so glad he's taking
﻿time out to meet us today!

884
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:44,514
﻿The ginseng tea's working!

885
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:53,152
﻿Pleased to meet you.

886
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:01,262
﻿You're not taking a photo?

887
01:16:01,864 --> 01:16:03,692
﻿Oh! Photo...

888
01:16:04,396 --> 01:16:05,591
﻿Excuse us.

889
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:09,171
﻿Hey, not with your cell phones!

890
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:12,706
Ah, thank you! Here, take it!

891
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:16,509
﻿It's a digital camera...

892
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:23,320
﻿What are you doing?

893
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:28,193
﻿Ready?
﻿Okay then, say "cheese!"

894
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:35,094
﻿How did you come today?

895
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:36,969
By plane.

896
01:16:39,828 --> 01:16:41,034
What's wrong?

897
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:47,411
﻿Anyway. I've set aside an hour.
﻿For Nozomi Estate.

898
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:48,776
We're honoured.

899
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:52,781
﻿May we organise
﻿some evening entertainment for you?

900
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:55,479
Of course!

901
01:16:56,745 --> 01:17:00,786
It's galling. We did our best
﻿to get a result.

902
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:06,991
Your effort hasn't gone to waste.
﻿It's why we've come this far.

903
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:09,094
Excuse me.

904
01:17:09,224 --> 01:17:12,671
Komachi, make yourself available tonight.

905
01:17:12,828 --> 01:17:14,501
﻿Our president's in town.

906
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,042
﻿She came from Tokyo?

907
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:19,573
﻿Do you know Sonic Foods?

908
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:22,743
﻿Yes, I've heard of them.

909
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:25,851
They're taking her to Nakasu.

910
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:28,518
﻿You want me to go?

911
01:17:29,945 --> 01:17:33,483
Wouldn’t Ariake be better?

912
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:42,291
﻿Apparently, our president
﻿wants to see you.

913
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:45,136
﻿Me?

914
01:17:46,628 --> 01:17:49,199
﻿I don't get any of this.

915
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:53,695
﻿Anyway, let me teach you
﻿some Nakasu lingo.

916
01:17:54,032 --> 01:17:55,055
﻿Come with me.

917
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:59,219
Thank you. It's the first time for me.

918
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:00,578
﻿Yeah, right.

919
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:09,595
﻿—Sir. may I make a toast?
﻿—Sure.

920
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:14,765
﻿—Okay, cheers everyone!
﻿—Cheers!

921
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:17,564
﻿Cheers to you too, ma'am.

922
01:18:20,395 --> 01:18:22,534
﻿Ah, delicious!

923
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:26,710
﻿Exceptional!

924
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:30,846
﻿—You're cute!
﻿—Thank you.

925
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:32,883
﻿Is blowfish out of season?

926
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:37,047
﻿President, you have to wait
﻿until the sumo starts. Right?

927
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:41,320
﻿You'll have to hold your breath!

928
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,657
﻿Excuse me.
﻿There's a call for you, sir.

929
01:18:43,785 --> 01:18:46,056
For me? Who could it be?

930
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:48,163
﻿Excuse me, please.

931
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:55,533
I see. ﻿I'll talk it over with her.

932
01:18:59,691 --> 01:19:01,102
Listen...

933
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:06,280
﻿It's wonderful that the
﻿Fukuoka Airport is so nearby.

934
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:10,221
﻿But there's the bullet train too.

935
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,589
﻿I go to Hakata Station often.

936
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:13,624
﻿Excuse me, Ma'am.

937
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:15,556
Your colleague is asking for you.

938
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:18,324
﻿Mr Chikugo, please excuse me.

939
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:22,196
﻿I must attend to some other matters.

940
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,694
Finally!

941
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,063
That's business.

942
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:30,373
"Kei Komachi".

943
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:37,976
﻿Komachi! Komachi!

944
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:41,815
What are you doing?
﻿Hurry up, they're waiting!

945
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:44,883
﻿Oh, it's this way.

946
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:47,187
﻿I just spotted a club
﻿named after an express train.

947
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:50,890
﻿This is bad.

948
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:55,525
﻿Our subsidiaries can't handle
﻿intricate work like that.

949
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:59,598
﻿Sonic Foods want technical skill,
﻿not real estate.

950
01:20:00,162 --> 01:20:03,439
﻿Then we have to
﻿reach out from our group...

951
01:20:03,565 --> 01:20:05,169
and find a new subcontractor.

952
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,804
﻿Let's hit two more clubs...

953
01:20:08,937 --> 01:20:12,578
﻿and then if necessary,
﻿we’ll have to use your charms.

954
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:15,449
Got it. With him on board...

955
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:18,518
﻿—Kyushu will be ours.
﻿—Exactly.

956
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:21,759
﻿Ma'am, this is Komachi.

957
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:24,130
Komachi! Good to see you.

958
01:20:24,130 --> 01:20:25,526
It's been a while.

959
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:29,659
﻿I need to talk with Amagi,
﻿so please join them.

960
01:20:29,791 --> 01:20:33,600
﻿The most important man in Kyushu,
﻿Mr Chikugo is here.

961
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,439
﻿So watch yourself.

962
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,875
﻿Good luck.

963
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,248
﻿This way please.

964
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,041
﻿Excuse me.

965
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:49,211
Hey, it's that guy!

966
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:53,790
So you're President Chikugo!

967
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:56,226
﻿Of course I knew your name...

968
01:20:56,685 --> 01:20:58,494
﻿but I'm still new here...

969
01:20:59,554 --> 01:21:00,859
﻿Sit! Sit!

970
01:21:00,884 --> 01:21:02,561
﻿Come on, sit!

971
01:21:03,389 --> 01:21:04,362
﻿Excuse me.

972
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:10,500
﻿This is great!
We're reunited.

973
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:11,804
﻿That's right.

974
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:13,844
﻿Lucky we took a photo together.

975
01:21:13,969 --> 01:21:15,380
﻿I've got it here.

976
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:21,414
﻿Look at this...!

977
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:31,595
﻿What's going on here?
﻿Komachi, you know Mr Chikugo?

978
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:35,124
﻿What a coincidence!

979
01:21:35,357 --> 01:21:39,066
﻿You're not from Kyushu, are you?

980
01:21:40,128 --> 01:21:43,439
﻿Everyone's her so let's have a toast.

981
01:21:43,565 --> 01:21:46,944
﻿A toast! Splendid!
﻿Please have seat, ma'am.

982
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:51,781
All right, a toast. Ready, Sir?

983
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,079
﻿—Cheers!
﻿—Cheers!

984
01:21:56,211 --> 01:22:01,092
Ma'am...!
﻿From what I can tell...

985
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:04,163
...﻿it seems like they are an item.

986
01:22:04,486 --> 01:22:05,362
﻿An item?

987
01:22:05,487 --> 01:22:09,629
﻿They're having fun
﻿talking about their hobby.

988
01:22:09,791 --> 01:22:13,204
We'd better keep our mouths shut.

989
01:22:13,328 --> 01:22:15,137
﻿So what should we do?

990
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:18,107
So, for us, we pretend we're drunk...

991
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,906
﻿and have fun with the hostesses...

992
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:23,243
so those two can be alone.

993
01:22:23,371 --> 01:22:25,248
﻿Isn't that your specialty?

994
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:27,546
﻿Is it...?

995
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,884
﻿So, Komachi, have you ever
﻿taken a sleeper train?

996
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:34,288
Yes.

997
01:22:34,916 --> 01:22:36,122
﻿On the top or bottom?

998
01:22:36,351 --> 01:22:37,830
﻿Mostly on top.

999
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:41,799
﻿In my day, we had three together.

1000
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:48,939
﻿Welcome, welcome.
﻿Welcome, welcome.

1001
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:53,738
Ami! Ami!
Ami! Ami! Ami!

1002
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:02,918
﻿Buying land and hoarding it,
then abandoning it in a recession...

1003
01:23:03,178 --> 01:23:04,418
we won't stand for it!

1004
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:09,619
Ignoring good advice
﻿on such a pretense is unforgivable!

1005
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:12,554
﻿That's easy for you to say.

1006
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:14,199
﻿I won't accept that!

1007
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:24,733
<i>﻿It was a short stay, but it was fun.</i>

1008
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,014
<i>Please come for New Year's day
﻿or summer festival.</i>

1009
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:30,879
<i>﻿I'll work harder for that.</i>

1010
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:42,186
﻿I need your help!

1011
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:45,894
﻿—I can stay longer?
﻿﻿—Yes!

1012
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:55,598
The technical skills that
﻿Mr Chikugo's company needs...

1013
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:59,011
﻿are right up Kodama Iron Works' alley.

1014
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:04,077
﻿You didn't have to go so far to help us.

1015
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:07,411
﻿Fixing model trains isn't enough.

1016
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,209
﻿You have to reveal your other talents.

1017
01:24:10,237 --> 01:24:11,206
﻿Let's do this!

1018
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:17,494
﻿Come in.

1019
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:19,157
Excuse me.

1020
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:22,999
﻿Oh, so it's you!

1021
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:30,070
No badge today?

1022
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:35,305
﻿This is work.
﻿I'll thoroughly review your proposal.

1023
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,547
﻿Of course.
﻿Thank you for considering us.

1024
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:44,647
﻿The product's a citrus fruit,
﻿a Kyushu specialty.

1025
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:50,896
We need precision components
﻿to fully extract its nutrients.

1026
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:53,328
﻿Here.

1027
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:57,030
﻿Sorry, Komachi.

1028
01:24:57,158 --> 01:24:59,900
Your factory site offer
﻿will have to wait.

1029
01:25:00,428 --> 01:25:03,466
﻿We need to find the right equipment first.

1030
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:05,753
﻿Over to you.

1031
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,672
﻿—Thank you.
﻿—Thank you.

1032
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:45,372
﻿These are the plans
﻿for the components.

1033
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,880
﻿How's this, factory chief?

1034
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:56,051
﻿It's perfect!

1035
01:26:56,177 --> 01:26:59,056
﻿And it can be achieved
﻿only with cutting technology.

1036
01:27:01,316 --> 01:27:04,593
﻿This will solve our yuzu problems.

1037
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,397
Boss! You said "yuzu"...

1038
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:12,560
Yuzu... Yuzu...

1039
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:16,276
Ex-yuzu me!

1040
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:24,581
﻿Now for the factory site.
﻿Find us a good one, Komachi.

1041
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:27,118
﻿Yes, Sir.

1042
01:27:41,055 --> 01:27:42,033
Hello?

1043
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,399
﻿Remember me? It's Azusa.

1044
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:45,601
Ah...

1045
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:50,571
What? You're in Kyushu too?
You should have told me.

1046
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:52,903
﻿You're the only one I can rely on.

1047
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:58,674
I ﻿can't figure out how I feel
﻿without seeing Komachi.

1048
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,983
﻿Or say what I want to say.

1049
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,100
Got it.

1050
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:07,991
Tell me when you arrive in Kyushu.
﻿I'll do what I can.

1051
01:28:27,535 --> 01:28:29,515
﻿Mr Hayatono!

1052
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:37,979
﻿This land is vital for
﻿the future of Kyushu!

1053
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:40,054
﻿Don't try to fool me.

1054
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:44,055
They're thinking of
﻿shutting the railway down.

1055
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:47,566
﻿If so, who'd work at a factory
﻿way out here?

1056
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:53,438
﻿Most of all, it would
﻿provide jobs for the local people.

1057
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:56,838
﻿That way, this railway would be saved.

1058
01:28:57,765 --> 01:29:00,788
﻿Seeing your land near this railway...

1059
01:29:00,813 --> 01:29:02,929
﻿I thought it'd be good
 ﻿to build a factory here.

1060
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:05,083
Please consider about it.

1061
01:29:10,345 --> 01:29:13,883
﻿It would be a shame
﻿to lose this railway.

1062
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:27,435
﻿Hey, if you want my land...

1063
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:30,810
you got to be able to keep up with me.

1064
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:35,542
﻿You're pathetic.
﻿Prove to me that you want it!

1065
01:29:37,605 --> 01:29:39,915
﻿Did he just call me pathetic?

1066
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:10,341
Komachi?

1067
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:30,429
You're at it early.
You have time to run?

1068
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:35,430
﻿Right now, this is my job.
﻿I've got to do it.

1069
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:38,868
I'm off to Chikugo's factory.

1070
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:40,471
See you later.

1071
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:51,987
That's the best you can do?

1072
01:31:06,561 --> 01:31:10,065
I ﻿thought a new factory
﻿would be impossible right now.

1073
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:13,378
﻿But it will be great for
﻿providing local jobs.

1074
01:31:14,602 --> 01:31:16,673
﻿It will be a fine workplace.

1075
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:20,685
Especially ﻿with you
and Mr Chikugo in charge.

1076
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:25,351
﻿He has been misunderstood.

1077
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:31,461
﻿I imagine your company's technology
﻿is highly regarded even in Tokyo?

1078
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:35,098
It ought to be.

1079
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:42,367
﻿—Excuse me...
﻿—Please go ahead.

1080
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:48,074
﻿Hello?

1081
01:31:48,369 --> 01:31:51,441
It's Ayame, the girl who turned you down.

1082
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:56,279
﻿So you're in Hakata?

1083
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:59,084
﻿I am too.
Do you want to meet?

1084
01:32:01,415 --> 01:32:05,795
﻿Meet you? Can I do that?

1085
01:32:09,023 --> 01:32:13,296
I ﻿came to see my father...

1086
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:15,634
﻿but what are you doing here?

1087
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:19,741
﻿I'm seeing a friend.

1088
01:32:22,103 --> 01:32:24,879
Ayame, you're from here?

1089
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:30,980
I really like you, Kodama.

1090
01:32:31,112 --> 01:32:34,559
﻿It's not your fault that
﻿I turned you down.

1091
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:39,022
﻿But I felt bad,
﻿so I wanted to be honest with you.

1092
01:32:40,688 --> 01:32:41,826
Really?

1093
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:04,447
﻿Yes, really.

1094
01:33:05,012 --> 01:33:08,892
﻿The train ride and the picnic
﻿weren't tiring at all...

1095
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:11,151
and I thoroughly enjoyed our first date.

1096
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:12,581
﻿That's the truth.

1097
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:14,426
﻿I got it.

1098
01:33:19,827 --> 01:33:24,702
﻿But you know, my mother
﻿really likes your father.

1099
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:26,311
﻿She wants to marry him!

1100
01:33:30,805 --> 01:33:33,911
﻿It's no use telling me that.

1101
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:37,619
Please understand that
﻿I just want her to be happy.

1102
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:47,129
Is your work going well?

1103
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:54,736
﻿Well, if my current job goes well,
all they'll need is a site.

1104
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:58,667
﻿My friend's negotiating
with a landowner...

1105
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:03,412
an old guy who runs in
a Spanish soccer kit.

1106
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:07,748
﻿My friend's running with him
﻿to persuade him.

1107
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:13,146
An old guy in a Spanish soccer kit?

1108
01:34:20,821 --> 01:34:24,496
﻿—So you like running.
﻿—I don't, to be honest.

1109
01:34:24,625 --> 01:34:26,969
﻿Okay then, you don't have to run anymore.

1110
01:34:28,095 --> 01:34:29,597
What do you mean?

1111
01:34:29,730 --> 01:34:32,574
Well... let's have some coffee.

1112
01:34:50,651 --> 01:34:53,222
﻿It's the lifeblood for tired men.

1113
01:34:56,590 --> 01:34:59,602
﻿—You like Chandler?
﻿—Yes, more or less.

1114
01:35:02,263 --> 01:35:06,541
﻿Then I'll sell my land to your company.

1115
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:10,949
﻿Really?

1116
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:45,448
﻿Hello, Komachi?

1117
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:47,983
We've got the land!

1118
01:35:50,111 --> 01:35:53,220
Oh... really?

1119
01:35:54,259 --> 01:35:55,579
﻿That's great.

1120
01:35:56,951 --> 01:36:00,922
﻿You don't sound very impressed.
﻿You should be happy.

1121
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:05,534
﻿Of course I'm happy.

1122
01:36:06,293 --> 01:36:10,332
﻿We should meet at
﻿the appropriate station...

1123
01:36:10,464 --> 01:36:11,807
﻿and have a drink to celebrate.

1124
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:14,538
﻿The appropriate station?

1125
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:18,240
Yes, the appropriate station!

1126
01:36:59,747 --> 01:37:03,320
﻿Actually, Ayame, the girl
﻿who I considered marrying...

1127
01:37:03,751 --> 01:37:06,288
﻿turned out to be Hayatono's daughter.

1128
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:15,564
What? So did things go well with her?

1129
01:37:16,764 --> 01:37:18,175
﻿It's complicated.

1130
01:37:19,133 --> 01:37:23,411
But bonds between people
﻿are truly important.

1131
01:37:24,738 --> 01:37:26,718
Anyway, cheers!

1132
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:28,219
﻿Cheers!

1133
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:39,762
﻿Being dumped doesn't
﻿discourage you either, does it?

1134
01:37:42,156 --> 01:37:45,899
﻿But I can't figure out why
﻿we came here though.

1135
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:47,437
﻿Don't you think it suits us?

1136
01:37:48,262 --> 01:37:51,072
﻿I looked it up in the timetable.

1137
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:06,190
﻿I'll catch this train home.﻿
You'll catch the next one.

1138
01:38:06,647 --> 01:38:09,628
﻿But I'll have to wait for an hour.

1139
01:38:10,117 --> 01:38:12,063
Why are you leaving me here?

1140
01:38:12,186 --> 01:38:13,927
You won't be alone.

1141
01:38:16,490 --> 01:38:18,834
Just trust me and do as I ask.

1142
01:39:22,389 --> 01:39:24,369
Why are you here?

1143
01:39:25,326 --> 01:39:26,999
﻿I just wanted to see you.

1144
01:39:27,227 --> 01:39:30,798
﻿—You got a rail pass?
﻿—Does it matter?

1145
01:39:32,766 --> 01:39:35,975
﻿Anyway, I came to see you.

1146
01:39:40,574 --> 01:39:42,315
﻿Something's up, isn't it?

1147
01:39:55,189 --> 01:39:58,227
﻿Look, gentians.

1148
01:40:11,338 --> 01:40:13,409
﻿It was gerberas when we first met.

1149
01:40:14,008 --> 01:40:15,078
That's right.

1150
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:39,375
﻿Are we alone? Nobody's watching?

1151
01:40:41,168 --> 01:40:45,310
We're alone, and nobody's watching.

1152
01:40:47,241 --> 01:40:49,585
﻿If you like me, kiss me.

1153
01:41:05,759 --> 01:41:08,239
Ah, that sounds like a KiHa 125!

1154
01:41:10,497 --> 01:41:11,601
﻿Who cares?

1155
01:41:12,299 --> 01:41:15,280
﻿Ah... sorry.

1156
01:41:24,990 --> 01:41:27,122
﻿—This is serious!
﻿—It always is with you.

1157
01:41:27,147 --> 01:41:29,354
﻿But this is more serious than serious.

1158
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:34,090
﻿Mr Chikugo wants us to
﻿coordinate his supplement factory!

1159
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:37,530
Really? We did it!

1160
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:39,243
It's serious indeed!

1161
01:41:39,293 --> 01:41:40,499
Congratulations!

1162
01:41:42,529 --> 01:41:46,636
﻿So was there actually any point
﻿in me going?

1163
01:41:49,136 --> 01:41:51,116
﻿Of course there was!

1164
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:54,480
﻿Glad to hear it.

1165
01:41:58,679 --> 01:42:01,216
﻿—Congratulations!
﻿—We made it!

1166
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:10,398
﻿We did it!

1167
01:42:10,524 --> 01:42:12,595
﻿We got the loan!

1168
01:42:12,726 --> 01:42:14,797
﻿It's all thanks to Kenta!

1169
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:16,166
﻿Really?

1170
01:42:16,864 --> 01:42:18,775
﻿Thank you!

1171
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:21,140
﻿That’s great!

1172
01:42:21,768 --> 01:42:22,838
﻿It hurts...

1173
01:42:22,936 --> 01:42:26,008
Thank you!

1174
01:42:27,708 --> 01:42:30,245
﻿We did it!

1175
01:42:30,377 --> 01:42:31,879
﻿Congratulations!

1176
01:42:32,679 --> 01:42:37,253
We're just getting to know Komachi...

1177
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:40,662
﻿but he will return
﻿to the head office today.

1178
01:42:41,054 --> 01:42:44,194
﻿It's a shame, 
but that's a salaryman's lot.

1179
01:42:44,525 --> 01:42:47,131
﻿Let's bid him a warm farewell.

1180
01:42:50,297 --> 01:42:53,801
﻿Everyone... thank you very much.

1181
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:03,150
﻿Now it's time for
﻿our usual morning exercises.

1182
01:43:11,852 --> 01:43:12,592
﻿Good job!

1183
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:14,790
﻿Well done!

1184
01:43:16,957 --> 01:43:18,163
﻿Thank you.

1185
01:43:19,793 --> 01:43:22,637
﻿Fancy sneaking out to Nakasu?

1186
01:43:23,363 --> 01:43:26,173
﻿I'll find you a hostess who's into trains.

1187
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,238
Thank you.

1188
01:43:31,138 --> 01:43:35,052
﻿Knowledge may be power,
﻿but hobbies are too.

1189
01:43:37,844 --> 01:43:38,822
﻿Thank you.

1190
01:43:39,146 --> 01:43:41,092
﻿May I embrace you, Komachi?

1191
01:43:56,550 --> 01:43:57,824
﻿Good job!

1192
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:00,933
I ﻿was only here briefly,
﻿but thank you for everything.

1193
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:15,683
﻿—Komachi, morning!
﻿—Morning, Midori.

1194
01:44:15,816 --> 01:44:19,628
﻿You're back so soon.
﻿I bet you wanted to stay longer.

1195
01:44:19,753 --> 01:44:21,061
﻿That's the truth.

1196
01:44:21,521 --> 01:44:23,592
You might be off again soon.

1197
01:44:23,724 --> 01:44:27,501
You know something?
﻿Where? Where to?

1198
01:44:27,894 --> 01:44:31,273
﻿To take me out for a meal soon.

1199
01:44:31,665 --> 01:44:33,235
﻿Got it.

1200
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:42,777
- ﻿Excuse me!
- ﻿Excuse me.

1201
01:44:49,016 --> 01:44:49,994
﻿Come in...!

1202
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:52,392
﻿Sorry for the wait.

1203
01:44:59,059 --> 01:45:02,404
﻿You wanted to stay
﻿in Kyushu longer, didn't you?

1204
01:45:02,829 --> 01:45:04,172
To be honest, yes.

1205
01:45:05,565 --> 01:45:08,409
﻿Our company is expanding.

1206
01:45:08,535 --> 01:45:11,914
﻿I want you to take a venture
business approach...

1207
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:13,985
and you may travel the country.

1208
01:45:14,741 --> 01:45:17,881
﻿I like travelling, a little.

1209
01:45:19,112 --> 01:45:22,321
A little?
﻿You sound like someone I know.

1210
01:45:38,932 --> 01:45:40,572
—Cheers!
﻿—Cheers!

1211
01:45:47,207 --> 01:45:50,017
﻿You did great. You saved us.

1212
01:45:50,944 --> 01:45:54,517
﻿I'm glad we can all
﻿concentrate on our work now.

1213
01:45:55,749 --> 01:45:58,662
﻿They say love's a mystery, but...

1214
01:45:59,453 --> 01:46:01,364
﻿Ayame really came through for us.

1215
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:05,025
Dad...

1216
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:06,828
What's with that?

1217
01:46:07,728 --> 01:46:08,763
﻿Well...

1218
01:46:10,330 --> 01:46:14,437
﻿it seems that Ayame's mother
﻿is serious about you.

1219
01:46:14,568 --> 01:46:15,706
Listen up.

1220
01:46:16,336 --> 01:46:19,374
﻿No matter how helpful
﻿they've been, I can't do it.

1221
01:46:20,006 --> 01:46:23,544
Love and romance aren't transactions.

1222
01:46:24,845 --> 01:46:26,518
﻿I admire you, Dad.

1223
01:46:26,646 --> 01:46:28,683
﻿Actually, there's a Kamata hostess...

1224
01:46:29,483 --> 01:46:36,423
...﻿in her thirties called Mizuho.
﻿I've hit it off with her.

1225
01:46:37,190 --> 01:46:38,891
Mizuho.

1226
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:40,059
Dad!

1227
01:46:55,976 --> 01:46:57,319
How's Tokyo?

1228
01:46:59,112 --> 01:47:00,853
﻿It's not that bad to be back.

1229
01:47:02,482 --> 01:47:07,665
﻿Do you prefer neon lights
﻿or the sound of bugs chirping?

1230
01:47:09,790 --> 01:47:14,100
﻿No neon lights means fewer trains...

1231
01:47:14,227 --> 01:47:15,934
﻿so I guess I prefer neon lights.

1232
01:47:27,441 --> 01:47:28,977
﻿Do you want to marry me?

1233
01:47:35,515 --> 01:47:39,429
﻿I really like you,
﻿but I don't want to just yet.

1234
01:47:40,787 --> 01:47:42,198
﻿I want to do it now.

1235
01:47:44,991 --> 01:47:48,131
﻿I want to travel
﻿with my husband to Calgary...

1236
01:47:49,863 --> 01:47:51,000
﻿Helsinki...

1237
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:53,868
﻿Stockholm...

1238
01:47:55,569 --> 01:47:56,411
Vancouver...

1239
01:47:57,904 --> 01:47:59,815
﻿and lots of other places.

1240
01:48:01,808 --> 01:48:03,685
﻿These places are all chilly.

1241
01:48:06,513 --> 01:48:09,050
﻿An aborted kiss at a deserted station...

1242
01:48:09,749 --> 01:48:11,319
﻿I'll never forget that.

1243
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:14,755
﻿I'm getting married.

1244
01:48:15,789 --> 01:48:17,894
That's easy to say...

1245
01:48:18,258 --> 01:48:19,202
Not with you.

1246
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:21,500
﻿Let me introduce him.

1247
01:48:23,597 --> 01:48:26,168
Nice to meet you. I'm Thunderbird Jr.

1248
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:30,447
﻿I'm Komachi. Nice to meet you.

1249
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:33,779
Komachi, nice to meet you.
﻿I'm Thunderbird Jr.

1250
01:48:33,907 --> 01:48:35,887
﻿I've heard a lot about you.

1251
01:48:37,244 --> 01:48:38,723
﻿What have you heard?

1252
01:48:41,081 --> 01:48:43,721
﻿I've decided to marry him.

1253
01:48:44,184 --> 01:48:46,255
﻿He's a bobsledder.

1254
01:48:46,553 --> 01:48:49,796
﻿I'll see the world on tour with him.

1255
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:53,633
﻿That'll suit me better 
than a railway view.

1256
01:48:53,894 --> 01:48:57,467
I think I prefer planes to trains.

1257
01:49:02,035 --> 01:49:03,241
﻿I see.

1258
01:49:04,271 --> 01:49:06,444
﻿Congratulations, Thunderbird Jr.

1259
01:49:06,873 --> 01:49:08,079
﻿Thank you.

1260
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:11,413
﻿Congratulations, Azusa.

1261
01:49:12,078 --> 01:49:13,182
﻿Thank you.

1262
01:49:17,884 --> 01:49:20,091
Well, I will get going then.

1263
01:49:28,862 --> 01:49:31,035
﻿Thunderbird, huh?

1264
01:49:35,635 --> 01:49:39,139
﻿That's the Toyama-Osaka express.

1265
01:49:45,645 --> 01:49:49,525
﻿I wish I could run like a train
﻿through the streets of Tokyo.

1266
01:49:59,459 --> 01:50:00,904
﻿What are you doing?

1267
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,200
﻿She dumped me.

1268
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:29,700
﻿She's getting married.

1269
01:50:34,194 --> 01:50:35,500
﻿Really?

1270
01:50:38,850 --> 01:50:41,400
﻿Are we hopeless with women?

1271
01:50:41,700 --> 01:50:44,376
﻿I got turned down too.

1272
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:48,176
That's not it.

1273
01:50:49,743 --> 01:50:52,519
﻿There's a world that only we understand.

1274
01:50:56,983 --> 01:50:58,758
﻿You're right.

1275
01:51:09,262 --> 01:51:10,605
﻿He is right.

1276
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,808
﻿That goes for me too.

1277
01:51:15,068 --> 01:51:15,910
﻿Why are you here?

1278
01:51:15,935 --> 01:51:19,348
﻿Did your trains stop working again?

1279
01:51:19,673 --> 01:51:22,711
﻿Crossing the Kanmon Straits made sense.

1280
01:51:23,643 --> 01:51:27,022
I'﻿m negotiating with
﻿Nozomi Estate tomorrow.

1281
01:51:27,247 --> 01:51:28,920
﻿I see.

1282
01:51:45,799 --> 01:51:49,100
﻿Well, this is fun!

1283
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:52,842
﻿I envy you two.

1284
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:57,285
﻿When you become a boss,
﻿you lose your friends.

1285
01:52:01,681 --> 01:52:02,591
See you.

1286
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:25,534
﻿I want to go to Shikoku next time.
﻿I'd love to see the Inland Sea.

1287
01:53:26,166 --> 01:53:27,873
﻿It's Hokkaido for me.

1288
01:53:28,835 --> 01:53:31,111
﻿In the middle of a snowstorm.

1289
01:53:31,905 --> 01:53:33,782
Is it okay for you to leave the work?

1290
01:53:33,973 --> 01:53:35,953
﻿It's okay. I'll take time off.

1291
01:53:37,177 --> 01:53:41,255
﻿—Let's make it a double date.
﻿—That'll never happen.

1292
01:53:42,182 --> 01:53:45,220
﻿But it'll be great if it does, right?
﻿Right?

1293
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,000
In Memory Of
Yoshimitsu Morita (1950-2011).
