1
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:28,664
Hey, love your umbrella.

2
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,980
- Dr. Mills. Dr. Budlong.
- Morosini, Carvalho, come with me.

3
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:54,064
If he thinks he's going to ruin any more
equipment he's underestimated the facility.

4
00:03:00,372 --> 00:03:04,239
- He thinks he's cute, doesn't he?
- Yes, but I was mother's favourite.

5
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:05,705
Dr. Mills.

6
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:11,412
- This is the last time I'll warn you.
- I won't let the Klystron go above 300.

7
00:03:11,507 --> 00:03:14,793
Thas what you said last time it rained,
but you turned it to 350.

8
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:17,637
Do you know what it costs
to repair a Klystron tube?

9
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:21,553
I know, Dr. Budlong. I'm very sorry,
but believe me it won't happen again.

10
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:24,180
You have my word on that, and I promise.

11
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:28,435
Don't worry. He can't go blowing up
your Klyman tube or whatever it is.

12
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:31,311
We've got a date tonight,
happy hour at Mingles.

13
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:33,560
Mingles. You know what that means?

14
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:34,686
What?

15
00:03:34,947 --> 00:03:36,986
It means complimentary hors ïoeuvres.

16
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:40,074
A veritable who's who
of secretaries and beauticians.

17
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,283
It means 20th century music.

18
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:46,619
You look like a sensible man.
You believe there's life on other planets?

19
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:49,828
- I don't believe there's life in this room.
- Exactly.

20
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:54,464
Your brother wants to send a radar signal
to a point in space so far away...

21
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:57,675
...id take 92 years to get there
and 92 years to get back.

22
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,132
Ninety-two years? Steve, we're late now.

23
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:03,756
Indeed. There isn't anything
out there, Dr. Mills.

24
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,929
We're it.

25
00:04:05,685 --> 00:04:09,813
Now don't you go above 300
or I'm revoking your funding.

26
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:16,858
Now that Dr. Strangelove is gone, les go.
Mingles is at high party.

27
00:04:16,946 --> 00:04:18,523
I can't tonight, Ron.

28
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:21,147
Is raining.

29
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:25,191
Tonight I've got another destination
in mind. I wanna go right there.

30
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:31,083
Clouds of Magellan. It sounds like
some kind of woman's underwear.

31
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:35,002
No, the Clouds of Magellan is
the name of our neighbouring galaxy.

32
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:37,460
You want to send a radar signal
to the next galaxy?

33
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:39,506
You can't get radar to the next galaxy.

34
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:43,127
You'd have to travel faster than
the speed of light. No one can do that.

35
00:04:43,221 --> 00:04:46,257
Don't watch that, it won't change.
This is the one to watch.

36
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,057
I like the Clouds of Magellan.

37
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:49,685
We can't get there, Ron.

38
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:52,853
But if we increase the power of
the Klystron, with lightning...

39
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:56,308
...we may get a signal strong enough
to get out of the solar system.

40
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,811
Thas the theory, anyway.

41
00:04:57,902 --> 00:05:01,437
Right. Thanks.
Tell me something I don't know.

42
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:07,608
Can't this wait? Secretaries are
like animals when it comes to free food.

43
00:05:07,703 --> 00:05:10,787
The reflectors line up for 10 days
only once every 19 months.

44
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:13,542
Now, with all this rain
and lightning, is perfect.

45
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,168
Perfect for men like us.

46
00:05:15,252 --> 00:05:18,917
Christ! Steve, when was the last time
you went out with a woman?

47
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:23,542
January of '86. No. March of '86.

48
00:05:24,428 --> 00:05:28,342
I took Dr. Elizabeth Conway
to see the Halley's Comet retrospective.

49
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:29,427
Superb.

50
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:31,639
- You see it?
- Sure, a couple of times.

51
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:35,261
How can we be brothers?
We don't have a single gene in common.

52
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:39,067
- Not above 300 kilowatts.
- Hi.

53
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:44,821
Okay. Thank you. Have fun.

54
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:50,775
We have no time to sweep frequencies.
We'll lower it below three centimetres.

55
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,862
But below?

56
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:56,160
Is raining out here. I'm getting wet!

57
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:59,455
This jacket is a Ralph Lauren!

58
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:01,504
And is smelly.

59
00:06:01,714 --> 00:06:03,172
Great, just great.

60
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:06,258
I'm wet and smelly.
They're gonna jump all over me.

61
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:14,012
Do you guys smell fish?

62
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:20,516
Is me!

63
00:06:32,785 --> 00:06:36,486
- Help me rotate the dish.
- Where's this lightning supposed to strike?

64
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:37,743
Right here.

65
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,995
Here?

66
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:44,335
That almost hit my shoe.

67
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,835
Excuse me.

68
00:06:53,514 --> 00:06:54,759
All the way up.

69
00:07:05,317 --> 00:07:07,986
I hate this. What the hell is this thing?

70
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:12,774
Klystron tube. Potential of 400 megawatts,
at an oscillation of 60 gigahertz.

71
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:15,281
Great. Why don't we take this to Mingles?

72
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:20,369
Stupid piece of garbage.

73
00:07:23,084 --> 00:07:25,753
Now all we gotta do
is harness the lightning.

74
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,185
Yes, is good. Les try for lightning.

75
00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:45,637
- Is this important?
- Only if it works.

76
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:48,639
Okay, deep breath. Set your retractors.

77
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:52,774
How long is this gonna take?
Single women have short attention spans.

78
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:56,363
Prepare to initiate the system.

79
00:07:57,451 --> 00:07:58,696
Now!

80
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:00,911
Oh, Jesus!

81
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,618
- We got it!
- Look at it!

82
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:11,578
Is going! I love you!

83
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:38,941
What is happening?

84
00:08:39,783 --> 00:08:42,570
Steve! Whas happening?

85
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:46,952
Mills!

86
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:48,662
Mills!

87
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:51,285
What is happening?

88
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,262
The Klystron!

89
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:25,023
We have a red condicion in che second unic.

90
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:27,908
Fire concrol/ The laboracory area.

91
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:33,866
I'm okay.

92
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:41,418
Beautiful!

93
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:46,253
What?

94
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,136
My God!

95
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:52,051
I didn't only get out of the solar system,
I just went out of the galaxy.

96
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:55,181
That means we were travelling faster
than the speed of light.

97
00:09:55,273 --> 00:09:57,016
How the hell did we do that?

98
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:17,835
Eleven seconds on the clock.

99
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,790
Down by one. Mills fakes left.
Goes around Magic Johnson.

100
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,288
Puts Kareem in the popcorn machine.

101
00:10:30,515 --> 00:10:35,510
Why can't I dunk? Is that asking so much?

102
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,159
You got out of the galaxy
and they fired you?

103
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:54,119
We were using lightning
to boost the power of the Klystron.

104
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:57,574
I shorted every telemetry tracker
in the place and all my monitors.

105
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,209
So there's no proof.

106
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:02,587
Thas not fair.

107
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:05,047
What are we going to do?

108
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,337
I might just have to take a...

109
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,049
What?

110
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:11,971
Take a teaching job.

111
00:11:13,307 --> 00:11:16,391
You know how that is?
One position for every 16 applicants.

112
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,350
I could double my babysitting.

113
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:20,394
Or take up a newspaper route.

114
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:22,600
Do girls do that now?

115
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:27,352
Is beautiful up there.

116
00:11:29,572 --> 00:11:32,063
Two hundred billion stars in our galaxy.

117
00:11:32,742 --> 00:11:34,900
Thas really my office up there.

118
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:39,783
I wish Mom could have lived long enough
to see you get out of the galaxy.

119
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,786
She'd be having the whole block in
for champagne!

120
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:48,132
Think you'll ever find
anyone like her again?

121
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:52,750
Boy. Jess, I don't know.

122
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:57,429
The chances of me finding another woman
like your mother are the same...

123
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:01,680
...as me proving there's life on another
planet up there. Figure one in 16 billion.

124
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:07,102
All right, Larry Byrd, whas for dinner?

125
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:08,852
Fish sticks. Pop tarts.

126
00:12:08,944 --> 00:12:12,277
Frozen pizza. Whatever else we can nuke
in the microwave.

127
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,533
What do you say, Dave?

128
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:19,904
Can we see Sirius tonight?

129
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,863
You know, is also called the Dog Star.

130
00:12:28,504 --> 00:12:29,536
Come on.

131
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:10,710
- Is quite a small planet, really.
- Half che size of ours, buc very busy.

132
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:14,080
- Have you mastered it yet?
- Of course.

133
00:13:14,215 --> 00:13:16,338
You know how superb our research is.

134
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:19,510
All I have co do is ceach you
everyching I know in 20 minuces.

135
00:13:19,596 --> 00:13:22,169
We're at light 30 approaching light 35.

136
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,889
This is a record glide speed.
They didn'c chink we'd make ic chis fasc.

137
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:28,053
Look, is Saturn.

138
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:31,482
- Could we stop there on the way back?
- Maybe.

139
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:35,265
Why can't I fit Neptune into this picture?

140
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:38,570
Wait. That works.

141
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:42,946
Neptunians won't like it, though.

142
00:13:43,077 --> 00:13:44,357
Les see here.

143
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:47,496
Look at Neptune now!

144
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:50,957
- Dad, we'll be late for Uncle Ron's party.
- Look at Neptune.

145
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:53,331
I haven't finished the M.I.T. Proposal yet.

146
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,290
- Come on.
- I hate leaving the universe in such a mess.

147
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:57,875
Here, put this on.

148
00:13:58,592 --> 00:14:00,964
Look at this.
Do these things ever work? No.

149
00:14:01,052 --> 00:14:04,255
The modern light bulb has a half-life
of about 10 minutes.

150
00:14:04,347 --> 00:14:07,597
- I'm going to take it apart.
- Is not the bulb, is the switch.

151
00:14:07,809 --> 00:14:10,300
You've been meaning to fix it, remember.

152
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:15,357
Dad, you're impossible.

153
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:17,019
Do we have any socks?

154
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:25,692
See, I knew I had a pair in reserve.
And they're dry.

155
00:14:25,826 --> 00:14:27,618
I've been cooking 'em since yesterday.

156
00:14:27,703 --> 00:14:31,036
Daddy, look at me.
Do you see anything different about me?

157
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:36,043
I'm wearing a bra.

158
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,662
You can't be! You're only 13!

159
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:41,497
My God!

160
00:14:42,843 --> 00:14:43,957
You're 13.

161
00:14:45,887 --> 00:14:46,966
A bra?

162
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:53,216
Well, did you get the right strap size?

163
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:56,223
Cup size. Yeah, A-minus.

164
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:04,863
Where have I been?

165
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,994
How can I learn everything I need to know
in only six more minutes?

166
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,964
This is a very backward planec.

167
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:28,592
The Mondschein 40 is che mosc advanced
research facilicy in che norchern universe.

168
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,967
Research has decermined you musc be
che mosc desirable woman on che planec.

169
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,425
Men on Earch will fall co cheir knees...

170
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,563
...becray cheir councries and give away
real escace for a beauciful woman.

171
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,106
Thas silly.

172
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,606
Will I need to eat?

173
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,574
No. We'll only be in che place for 24 hours.

174
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,368
This is che mosc imporcanc assignmenc
any of us has undercaken.

175
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,620
I feel so poorly prepared.

176
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,921
You're the Earth expert.

177
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:09,833
Buc you are che Chief Excragalaccic Probisc.
You know che Council's direccive.

178
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,087
I can only be your adviser.

179
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,464
Are you sure this research is accurate?

180
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,593
Celesce, che Mondschein 40
is never wrong.

181
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:44,473
Right. Les go.

182
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:01,981
Hors ïoeuvres?

183
00:18:04,788 --> 00:18:05,867
Kimberly.

184
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,581
- You met my brother Steve?
- No.

185
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,240
You gotta watch out for him,
but in the best sense.

186
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:13,329
He cares too deeply, like a sparrow.

187
00:18:17,467 --> 00:18:19,625
You've got something on your lip.

188
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,643
A little dip there.

189
00:18:30,146 --> 00:18:32,304
I think flossing is so important, too.

190
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:35,732
When I get up in the morning,
I don't even go to the bathroom first.

191
00:18:35,818 --> 00:18:37,858
I floss and then I go.

192
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:39,400
Thas so great.

193
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:42,240
Ron, I'm beginning to think
you're avoiding me.

194
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:47,450
Hi.

195
00:18:55,671 --> 00:18:57,497
Are you Dr. Steve Mills?

196
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:04,218
He's the guy dancing with his daughter.

197
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:10,309
Hors ïoeuvres?

198
00:19:17,817 --> 00:19:19,395
Thank you. Delicious.

199
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:23,270
Hello.

200
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:26,231
- Are you Dr. Steve Mills?
- Yes.

201
00:19:26,826 --> 00:19:30,076
Will you tell me the composition
of your radar beam or not?

202
00:19:30,162 --> 00:19:31,277
Which one?

203
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:34,706
Now, you don't fool me.
Your favourite colour is red.

204
00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:39,544
Your favourite food is lasagne,
and your favourite rocking is Pink Fred.

205
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:43,716
Actually, I prefer green,
I'm allergic to all pasta...

206
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,923
...and my favourite rock is Rachmaninoff.

207
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:49,256
Of course you'd say that.

208
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:52,017
I think is Pink Floyd,
not Pink Fred right, Jessie?

209
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,927
Pink Fred is their nickname.

210
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:57,101
Would you hold this for me, please?

211
00:19:57,314 --> 00:19:59,223
"Hey, hey we're the Monkees

212
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:00,983
"People say we monkey around

213
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,772
"But we're too busy singing
to put anybody down"

214
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:04,775
What?

215
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,573
Do you know what they say?
"Nixon's the One!"

216
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:08,986
Dick Nixon?

217
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:10,691
Okay.

218
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:15,121
See you later, bro.

219
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,791
Sailor, I like your jeep.

220
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:24,584
You've broken my heart for the last time.

221
00:20:28,177 --> 00:20:30,846
You've broken my heart
for the last time, too.

222
00:20:33,891 --> 00:20:36,642
Do you have any spinach,
my hands are freezing?

223
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,885
"I'm Popeye the sailor man
I'm Popeye the sailor man

224
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:44,268
"I'm strong to the 'finich'
'cause I eats me spinach

225
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:46,731
"I'm Popeye the sailor man
Toot, toot"

226
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,273
"This Buïs for you. "

227
00:20:58,081 --> 00:20:59,076
Baby!

228
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,870
Now will you tell me the composition
of your radar beam?

229
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:05,456
Wackygram, right?

230
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,376
Encore! Encore!

231
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:15,054
This is a nightmare.

232
00:21:15,306 --> 00:21:17,927
Your research was all wrong!
The food was all wrong!

233
00:21:18,017 --> 00:21:20,389
This dress is strange
and what is this thing?

234
00:21:20,477 --> 00:21:23,893
This hat is too big.
And everything I said was crazy.

235
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:27,392
Now jusc a second.
Don'c blame ic all on me.

236
00:21:27,651 --> 00:21:30,771
I never cold you chey used spinach
co keep cheir hands warm.

237
00:21:30,862 --> 00:21:32,522
Daddy, who was that?

238
00:21:32,948 --> 00:21:34,193
I don't know.

239
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:38,526
But I feel kinda sorry for her.
I don't think anybody liked her.

240
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:39,991
Did you?

241
00:21:44,209 --> 00:21:47,957
How are we ever going to get
Dr. Steve to transmit his signal now?

242
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:50,331
He thinks I'm a lunatic.

243
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:52,832
Now jusc calm down.

244
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:55,793
You've goc co go back in chere.

245
00:21:57,972 --> 00:21:59,087
And you...

246
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:03,925
- Hi.
- Hi.

247
00:22:06,981 --> 00:22:08,143
Tough room.

248
00:22:09,608 --> 00:22:12,313
I'm really sorry how rude I was in there.

249
00:22:12,403 --> 00:22:14,691
You weren't rude.
You were very entertaining.

250
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,030
In fact, I thought you were
a professional of some kind.

251
00:22:19,117 --> 00:22:22,569
Believe me, they'll be telling
their grandchildren about it.

252
00:22:22,662 --> 00:22:25,829
Have you done any interesting
radar astronomy transmissions...

253
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,249
...which may have penetrated
other galaxies in the last few days?

254
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:32,963
Yes, I have.

255
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:36,043
Well, what happened?

256
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:41,425
- Is pretty complex.
- Try me.

257
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:46,428
That was the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

258
00:22:47,562 --> 00:22:49,554
I mean, second most beautiful.

259
00:22:50,982 --> 00:22:51,930
Third.

260
00:22:53,025 --> 00:22:53,974
A dog.

261
00:22:56,112 --> 00:22:59,278
The system. I blew out every
resistance backup in the place...

262
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:03,149
...including telemetry trackers.
Those boys from defence were so mad.

263
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:06,328
'Cause thas what they use
for tracking missiles...

264
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,287
I must be boring the pants off you.

265
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:16,038
- No. They're still on.
- Good.

266
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:20,716
- Then what happened, Dr. Steve?
- I don't really know what happened.

267
00:23:20,802 --> 00:23:23,044
It must have been something
I did in the lab.

268
00:23:23,138 --> 00:23:25,925
Maybe I forgot to take a note
or dropped a setting.

269
00:23:26,015 --> 00:23:27,593
Show me what you did.

270
00:23:27,892 --> 00:23:29,719
Show me in your mighty lab.

271
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:32,019
I can't. They fired me.

272
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:37,609
You know I'm a little cold.
Would you mind very much if I just...

273
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:40,768
...stuck my hands right in your pockets?

274
00:23:41,781 --> 00:23:43,489
Yes, thas better.

275
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,819
So, Celeste...

276
00:23:50,915 --> 00:23:52,195
...where are you from?

277
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:55,662
The nether-lands.

278
00:23:56,128 --> 00:23:57,326
Oh, Holland.

279
00:23:57,629 --> 00:23:59,254
No, the nether-lands.

280
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,594
For an astronomer
you have the most wonderful fibres.

281
00:24:07,722 --> 00:24:10,344
And you've got yourself
a handful right now.

282
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:14,685
I can't get back in that lab.

283
00:24:15,271 --> 00:24:16,682
They're gonna kiss!

284
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:18,184
Does he know how?

285
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:22,064
Well, of course.
I saw him do it once in 1983.

286
00:24:27,241 --> 00:24:28,617
I'm a bad apple.

287
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,579
Excuse me a minute.

288
00:24:45,467 --> 00:24:47,839
I shouldn't be wearing this, should I?

289
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:50,376
Is very nice.

290
00:24:50,681 --> 00:24:52,389
Then what should I wear?

291
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:00,848
Thank you. I won't forget this.

292
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,785
Hold this.

293
00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:26,922
What are you doing now?

294
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:29,457
I have to change. This is inappropriate.

295
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:32,131
Might I suggest a more conventional spot?

296
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:34,427
Like the backseat of my car.

297
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,903
There. I'm changed.

298
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:00,449
Is this acceptable?

299
00:26:04,544 --> 00:26:06,501
Is the drool apparent?

300
00:26:25,272 --> 00:26:28,475
I'm sorry, Dr. Mills, we have strict orders
from Dr. Budlong...

301
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:30,476
...not to let you in the building.

302
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:34,068
I left something in my office.
It was a fuzzy Carebear pencil holder.

303
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:37,856
Excuse me. I'm from DARPA. The Defence
Advance Research Project Agency...

304
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:40,027
...with instructions to tour this facility.

305
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,911
- So I...
- May I see some ID?

306
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:04,425
Here.

307
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:08,103
See Department of Defence.

308
00:27:17,072 --> 00:27:18,448
She's with DARPA.

309
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,195
I'm with her.

310
00:27:22,619 --> 00:27:25,490
All settings are the same.
They haven't changed a thing.

311
00:27:25,581 --> 00:27:28,665
Dr. Steve, this is only
a Jansky-based telescope.

312
00:27:29,334 --> 00:27:31,825
Part of what used to be called a vast array.

313
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,951
Used to?

314
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:35,913
I see you had to use enormous thrust.

315
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:37,960
Where's the Klystron?

316
00:27:38,551 --> 00:27:41,042
Hold on, I'll see what they did with it.

317
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,814
- Good evening, Olaf.
- Good evening.

318
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:01,779
Is nice to have Dr. Mills back.

319
00:28:01,866 --> 00:28:03,942
- What do you mean?
- He's in his lab now.

320
00:28:04,034 --> 00:28:05,279
In his lab?

321
00:28:10,124 --> 00:28:13,907
There's nothing powerful enough
to have broken through our shields.

322
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:21,505
Is clear how the reflectors work.

323
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:27,348
They're not equipped to discover
this kind of power for another century.

324
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:30,844
How did they get it so fast?

325
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:33,722
I mean, they haven't even
figured out Stonehenge.

326
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:37,893
He musc be holding someching back.

327
00:28:38,192 --> 00:28:39,936
Dr. Sceve is lying.

328
00:28:43,239 --> 00:28:44,437
Who are you?

329
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:47,032
Who? Me?

330
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,570
What are you doing here?

331
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,167
Where's Mills?

332
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:03,834
Get away from my equipment.

333
00:29:31,452 --> 00:29:33,445
I've got to be on my way home.

334
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:38,117
I've got to get home to that good pie.

335
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,912
Just grab the handrail there.

336
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:45,333
Welcome to my office.

337
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:47,757
Sender number KD113B.

338
00:29:49,011 --> 00:29:51,763
Just like all the rest of them, but is mine.

339
00:29:53,348 --> 00:29:57,097
Did you ever think what you were doing
by invading another galaxy?

340
00:29:57,352 --> 00:29:58,977
It wasn't an invasion.

341
00:30:00,772 --> 00:30:03,394
Here was this galaxy,
minding its own business.

342
00:30:03,483 --> 00:30:06,057
Perhaps a galaxy where war
no longer exists.

343
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:08,980
People all live in harmony.

344
00:30:09,698 --> 00:30:12,271
Things don't go around
with such whizzings.

345
00:30:19,958 --> 00:30:21,535
You're shaking. Why?

346
00:30:22,293 --> 00:30:25,413
Because I've wanted to kiss you
from the first moment I saw you.

347
00:30:25,505 --> 00:30:26,453
What?

348
00:30:26,756 --> 00:30:30,041
You looked so beautiful and vulnerable,
then you started rhyming...

349
00:30:30,134 --> 00:30:33,135
...and doing all that talking
and singing and stuff and...

350
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,131
I just wanted to use everything I know
about radar astronomy to protect you.

351
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,559
Would you mind if I kissed you?

352
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,725
Does it hurt?

353
00:30:46,984 --> 00:30:48,526
Not the way I do it.

354
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:23,544
I have never felt anything like that
in my entire life.

355
00:33:29,015 --> 00:33:32,219
Do I now have to eat the chocolate
from Pennsylvania?

356
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:37,941
Listen, I think we'd better get out of here.

357
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:42,643
Are you sure you've told me everything
about the transmission?

358
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:47,026
I think so. But perhaps we should
explore it a little further.

359
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,285
I'd better take you home.

360
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:53,156
No, thas too far.
We must go to your place.

361
00:33:54,957 --> 00:33:57,626
- Are you feeling what I'm feeling?
- More.

362
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:01,374
I'm dreaming.

363
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:06,341
"Life could be a dream

364
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:08,250
"Sha-boom"

365
00:34:08,804 --> 00:34:10,512
As your great poet says.

366
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:20,144
Welcome to the Mills residence.

367
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:24,693
What is this?

368
00:34:25,612 --> 00:34:26,774
Hats.

369
00:34:26,863 --> 00:34:30,398
This one is a collector's item.
Actually belonged to Jimmy Durante.

370
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:31,572
Who?

371
00:34:33,995 --> 00:34:36,486
"Goodnight Mrs. Calabash,
wherever you are. "

372
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,913
He was a song and dance man
in the movies.

373
00:34:41,002 --> 00:34:44,702
Come on in, this is the palace.
Help yourself. Sit down. Steal an ashtray.

374
00:34:44,797 --> 00:34:47,549
I have to go check on Jessie.
Please don't leave...

375
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:52,010
...or otherwise I'll be forced to crawl up
under my bed and suck dust forever.

376
00:34:53,222 --> 00:34:54,930
So whas going on here?

377
00:34:55,516 --> 00:34:59,383
Could it be that he really doesn't know
how he made the transmission?

378
00:34:59,478 --> 00:35:01,055
- Whas that?
- Canine.

379
00:35:01,271 --> 00:35:02,896
Highly revered on chis planec.

380
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:05,353
Usually found
in che company of fire hydrancs.

381
00:35:05,442 --> 00:35:07,518
Now look, Dr. Sceve's lying.

382
00:35:07,778 --> 00:35:09,058
Don'c leave him alone.

383
00:35:09,154 --> 00:35:11,692
But he doesn't even care
about that anymore.

384
00:35:11,781 --> 00:35:13,904
Didn't you see during that kissing thing?

385
00:35:13,992 --> 00:35:16,565
His skin got hot and his heartbeat went up.

386
00:35:16,661 --> 00:35:19,697
And suddenly there was
a lot more of him down there.

387
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,238
Ic's an acc.

388
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:24,293
Governmenc cypes on chis planec
are crained co lie.

389
00:35:24,377 --> 00:35:27,544
Go find him. He may be burning papers
right this minute

390
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:29,376
Oh, God!

391
00:35:37,306 --> 00:35:39,133
She's beautiful, isn't she?

392
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:41,347
Who is she?

393
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:43,096
My daughter, Jessie.

394
00:35:43,854 --> 00:35:44,803
Short.

395
00:35:45,105 --> 00:35:46,932
Short? She's only 13.

396
00:35:47,775 --> 00:35:48,688
Thirteen?

397
00:35:50,027 --> 00:35:51,651
How old does she look?

398
00:35:51,987 --> 00:35:55,071
Six, seven hundred, just short.

399
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,791
Why don't we go in here?

400
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:08,950
My bedroom?

401
00:36:09,045 --> 00:36:12,710
Well, you said you wanted to talk.
Why go all the way downstairs?

402
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:14,798
Say, do you think I'm a billionaire?

403
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:19,048
Or somebody on television or somebody
who's really important or something?

404
00:36:19,138 --> 00:36:20,965
You're Steven Mills, Ph. D.

405
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:24,016
A very obscure physicist
who makes $25,000 a year.

406
00:36:25,144 --> 00:36:27,053
And you still want to go in here?

407
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:28,177
Yowza.

408
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:30,180
Yowza?

409
00:36:33,486 --> 00:36:34,944
You make me laugh.

410
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:39,068
I mean, you're the first person that has
really made me laugh since...

411
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:46,406
Look, if we do go in there, you know,
I might probably want to do more kissing.

412
00:36:47,416 --> 00:36:51,460
Surely. It was very pleasant.
But I hope thas not all you want to do.

413
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:10,093
Remember me?

414
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,013
You're so wonderful.

415
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,884
You're funny, you're intelligent
and you understand my work...

416
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,803
...and now you want to have sex.

417
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,305
I wanna have sex?

418
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,929
Don't you?

419
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:56,018
Do you?

420
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,390
Yes!

421
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,442
Well, I do, too.
As soon as I find out what it is.

422
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,775
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Of course.

423
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:23,961
What is sex?

424
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,218
- Whac?
- "What?" You heard what I said.

425
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:29,837
What is sex?

426
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:34,971
Give me a second.
One second. Take a look ac chis.

427
00:38:47,782 --> 00:38:48,731
Deleted.

428
00:38:48,825 --> 00:38:50,070
What good is deleted?

429
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,367
Now, don'c gec exciced. Jusc a second.
One liccle second. Here ic is.

430
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,200
Your penis is a weapon.

431
00:38:57,959 --> 00:38:59,536
Jusc like your rifle.

432
00:38:59,752 --> 00:39:03,287
The milicary expeccs you co procecc ic
and keep ic dry.

433
00:39:03,923 --> 00:39:06,592
All righc, men, if you'll open your manuals.

434
00:39:06,717 --> 00:39:09,006
- What? Is that it?
- Take ic easy.

435
00:39:09,386 --> 00:39:11,379
Here's someching else.

436
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:18,556
What does this mean, Debbie Does Dallas?

437
00:39:21,189 --> 00:39:22,897
Debbie Does Des Moines.

438
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:26,729
Debbie Does Düsseldorf.

439
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,563
Busy girl, that Debbie.

440
00:39:29,573 --> 00:39:30,901
Whas this?

441
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:41,952
Look behind you.

442
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:51,460
I can do that. I guess.

443
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:55,303
I don't believe it.

444
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:02,185
Why, chac's disguscing.

445
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:04,181
I can't, that right there.

446
00:40:06,483 --> 00:40:09,484
Look, thas the most weirdest thing
I've ever seen.

447
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,025
Thac's why we gave ic up 3,000 years ago.

448
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:24,410
You think I could do that?

449
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:27,916
Sure. Excepc for fuel
you're human inside and ouc.

450
00:40:28,046 --> 00:40:29,623
Buc do you wanc co?

451
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:32,798
The kissing wasn't so bad.

452
00:40:36,888 --> 00:40:38,714
You're noc leaving me here/

453
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,089
Yes, I am.

454
00:40:40,182 --> 00:40:44,679
I have been ordered co scay wich you
ac all cimes, co observe everyching you do/

455
00:40:45,062 --> 00:40:46,177
Forget it.

456
00:40:48,524 --> 00:40:49,437
Bicch/

457
00:41:23,808 --> 00:41:26,429
My God, you're beautiful.

458
00:42:59,025 --> 00:43:00,484
Are you all right?

459
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:03,487
Yes, don't stop.

460
00:43:19,378 --> 00:43:20,753
Do you see...

461
00:43:31,098 --> 00:43:35,178
Dr. Steve, that was so wonderful.

462
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:40,480
I feel like I've been hit by a train.

463
00:43:41,942 --> 00:43:45,145
And I don't think you need to call me
Dr. Steve anymore.

464
00:43:46,321 --> 00:43:50,319
Steve, you're so stupid. We could have
been doing this the whole time.

465
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:53,034
We only met three hours ago.

466
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:55,159
I know. What took you so long?

467
00:43:55,663 --> 00:43:57,241
Do others know about this?

468
00:43:57,332 --> 00:43:59,953
About us? I don't see how they could.

469
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:02,835
No, about making love.

470
00:44:03,588 --> 00:44:08,084
You could become very famous if
others in the world knew you could do this.

471
00:44:08,175 --> 00:44:09,456
- Really?
- Yes.

472
00:44:10,678 --> 00:44:13,881
Didn't think I did it any differently
than anybody else.

473
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:16,222
You mean everybody does this?

474
00:44:17,851 --> 00:44:20,093
Think of all the energy produced.

475
00:44:20,187 --> 00:44:24,600
Properly channelled that energy could
propel half your people out of the galaxy.

476
00:44:27,152 --> 00:44:29,310
We did some computer runs in the lab...

477
00:44:29,404 --> 00:44:32,322
...and figured if we could harness
the energy output from...

478
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:36,868
...the male members of the Sheen family
we could put the state of Illinois on Pluto.

479
00:44:40,331 --> 00:44:42,905
I really don't think I can
do this again so soon.

480
00:44:43,001 --> 00:44:44,376
Yes, you can.

481
00:44:46,754 --> 00:44:47,999
- Celeste?
- What?

482
00:44:48,548 --> 00:44:49,876
Celeste, why me?

483
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:55,213
Because you're sensitive...

484
00:44:55,846 --> 00:44:57,756
...and you're an outsider...

485
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,011
...and you worked so hard
to get through M.I. T...

486
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,680
...and you have two Ph. D.'s
and a delightful innocence.

487
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:07,431
Just all the qualities of a dreamer.

488
00:45:09,735 --> 00:45:12,938
I know you had some really bad luck
five years ago when...

489
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:16,031
...your wife died and left you
with a daughter, Jessie, 13.

490
00:45:16,783 --> 00:45:18,527
Thas who the short person was.

491
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:21,489
Wait a minute.
Where'd you get all those details?

492
00:45:23,248 --> 00:45:25,205
I can read it. In your eyes.

493
00:46:05,956 --> 00:46:07,450
Thas kiïs stuff.

494
00:46:09,918 --> 00:46:11,293
This is no help.

495
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:34,242
Whiceside, I'm here co spend
Chriscmas wich you.

496

Dave, bon appétit.

513
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:03,828
Dave, how are you
and your 1,000 fleas this morning?

514
00:49:11,802 --> 00:49:13,083
Are you okay?

515
00:49:13,596 --> 00:49:14,841
Yes, I'm okay.

516
00:49:17,308 --> 00:49:21,471
Jessie, Celeste.
Celeste, my daughter, Jessie.

517
00:49:22,438 --> 00:49:23,433
I know.

518
00:49:24,273 --> 00:49:25,648
You stayed here?

519
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,942
Just overnight.

520
00:49:29,111 --> 00:49:30,225
But dad...

521
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:32,774
...thas fabulous.

522
00:49:33,198 --> 00:49:34,361
I gotta go.

523
00:49:34,574 --> 00:49:36,282
Be true to your school.

524
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,822
Happy short person. Daughter.

525
00:49:43,959 --> 00:49:45,916
Almost as happy as her old man.

526
00:49:46,002 --> 00:49:47,200
Who is that?

527
00:49:47,879 --> 00:49:48,792
Me.

528
00:49:50,131 --> 00:49:51,709
Yes, I am happy, too.

529
00:49:52,592 --> 00:49:53,706
I think...

530
00:49:54,677 --> 00:49:55,507
Yes?

531
00:49:56,512 --> 00:49:59,086
Will I scare you if I tell you I love you?

532
00:49:59,223 --> 00:50:01,382
Not unless you hit me at the same time.

533
00:50:01,475 --> 00:50:02,389
I'm serious.

534
00:50:02,476 --> 00:50:03,639
So am I.

535
00:50:03,728 --> 00:50:06,100
Then les go away.
Les go to San Francisco.

536
00:50:06,188 --> 00:50:09,391
- Or Vancouver? Or Anchorage?
- No, I have to leave tonight.

537
00:50:09,483 --> 00:50:11,606
Leave? Where you going?

538
00:50:12,528 --> 00:50:13,393
Home.

539
00:50:13,946 --> 00:50:15,226
To the Netherlands?

540
00:50:15,322 --> 00:50:18,525
You can call it Holland now.
I know what you mean. Yes.

541
00:50:21,745 --> 00:50:23,488
When are you going to be back?

542
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,371
No, I'm never coming back.

543
00:50:30,462 --> 00:50:34,590
Never coming back? Why?
Why can't you ever come back?

544
00:50:35,175 --> 00:50:36,633
- Well I...
- Celeste.

545
00:50:36,718 --> 00:50:40,003
I hate to sound desperate,
but this news makes me sound desperate.

546
00:50:40,096 --> 00:50:42,931
I'm desperate. Celeste,
I know this is sudden...

547
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:46,301
...but you're the most incredible thing
thas ever happened to me.

548
00:50:46,394 --> 00:50:49,893
I look in your face
and I can't believe what I feel for you.

549
00:50:50,565 --> 00:50:55,108
I'm hopelessly, insanely, out of my mind
in love with you. I can't let you go.

550
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,526
Walk out of my life. I mean, I can't.

551
00:50:57,613 --> 00:51:00,448
Not now, not ever.
Without you there is no life.

552
00:51:00,866 --> 00:51:01,696
And?

553
00:51:02,409 --> 00:51:03,868
Will you marry me?

554
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:05,777
Marry you?

555
00:51:05,871 --> 00:51:07,116
Yes. Please.

556
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:10,748
This is a strange development.

557
00:51:10,959 --> 00:51:12,868
I know is sudden and quick and all.

558
00:51:12,961 --> 00:51:15,796
Not if you consider
I've been waiting five years for you.

559
00:51:15,881 --> 00:51:19,214
You see, before I met you
all I could think about was science.

560
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:22,758
Now I can't even think about that anymore.
All I care about is you.

561
00:51:22,846 --> 00:51:24,922
Your eyes, your skin, your hair, your face.

562
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:28,597
Do you think you could think
about science if we got married?

563
00:51:30,311 --> 00:51:34,523
If only I knew you were going to be
with me and you weren't going anywhere.

564
00:51:36,567 --> 00:51:40,019
I know is kinda sudden and everything,
so I'll tell you what.

565
00:51:40,113 --> 00:51:43,113
Why don't you take a short walk
and think about it?

566
00:51:43,908 --> 00:51:45,651
Okay, I'll think it over.

567
00:51:49,914 --> 00:51:52,405
You're not going out like that, are you?

568
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,660
No. Of course not.

569
00:52:03,594 --> 00:52:06,547
She's an original. She's gotta say yes.

570
00:52:13,103 --> 00:52:17,397
You said you'd prepare me for 24 hours,
and here is only been 12 hours.

571
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:20,436
You didn't tell me "spinach,"
you didn't tell me "kiss"...

572
00:52:20,527 --> 00:52:23,362
...you didn't tell me "have sex,"
and what about "marry"?

573
00:52:23,446 --> 00:52:25,771
Do things always happen
so fast on this planet?

574
00:52:25,865 --> 00:52:29,697
I don'c chink so. You can'c walk
down che screec looking like chis.

575
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,278
Yes, I can. I know how this planet works.

576
00:52:32,371 --> 00:52:35,242
They'll think I'm starting
some kind of trend or something.

577
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:39,579
I want you to contact the Council and
I want them here, I want them here now!

578
00:52:54,268 --> 00:52:55,133
Why here?

579
00:52:55,227 --> 00:52:58,892
They said chey needed an open field.
I found ic in che phone book.

580
00:52:59,314 --> 00:53:02,019
What goes on here?
Is it Christians and lions?

581
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,859
Wrong cime frame.

582
00:53:09,532 --> 00:53:12,901
- Where is che cransmission?
- We're making progress, sir.

583
00:53:12,994 --> 00:53:16,244
Our gravicy has increased chreefold/

584
00:53:16,789 --> 00:53:19,115
Does che subjecc suspecc who you are?

585
00:53:20,043 --> 00:53:21,786
- No.
- Does che girl?

586
00:53:24,505 --> 00:53:28,040
She saw Celesce puc magazines inco me
and a dress come ouc.

587
00:53:28,342 --> 00:53:29,421
Kill her/

588
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:35,422
Don't worry. She's nothing.
Short, inexperienced, just a daughter.

589
00:53:36,308 --> 00:53:38,716
- But we do have one problem.
- Yes?

590
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:43,221
The subject says he will be
unable to think about science...

591
00:53:43,816 --> 00:53:45,523
...unless he marries me!

592
00:53:46,526 --> 00:53:47,902
Well, marry him/

593
00:53:49,363 --> 00:53:51,402
But we don't know what "marry" is.

594
00:53:53,784 --> 00:53:55,064
One momenc.

595
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,164
Yes, che Mondschein 40 says
marriage is chis:

596
00:54:06,629 --> 00:54:09,915
"He goes off co fighc che Turks,
and you puc on a lock. "

597
00:54:15,096 --> 00:54:18,429
Yes. Wrong cencury. Marriage is chis:

598
00:54:18,849 --> 00:54:22,016
"You cook and clean
and bring him marcinis. "

599
00:54:22,812 --> 00:54:25,184
Wrong again? This is ridiculous.

600
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:30,809
Yes, wrong decade. Too old fashioned.

601
00:54:32,279 --> 00:54:35,695
"The modern marriage:
There are no rules or responsibilicies.

602
00:54:35,782 --> 00:54:39,317
"Buc if he does someching wrong,
you can sec him on fire while he sleeps.

603
00:54:39,411 --> 00:54:43,029
"And go on a calk show where
everyone will forgive you and love you. "

604
00:54:43,123 --> 00:54:46,207
There's only one drawback,
you'll have co have more sex.

605
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:47,699
I'll do it.

606
00:54:47,794 --> 00:54:49,169
Immediacely.

607
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:55,337
Yes, sir. I know tomorrow's the last day
the reflectors are in line for 19 months.

608
00:54:56,177 --> 00:54:57,837
What if there is no lightning?

609
00:54:57,929 --> 00:54:59,589
We will provide che lighcning.

610
00:54:59,681 --> 00:55:03,927
Jusc keep chac man fed
and keep his feec clean.

611
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:05,718
You're fading.

612
00:55:05,812 --> 00:55:09,595
Yes, I know, ic's our gravicy.
Now remember, you are our lasc hope.

613
00:55:09,815 --> 00:55:13,730
If we don'c gec chac cransmission from him,
our planec is doomed.

614
00:55:17,156 --> 00:55:18,354
Yes, sir.

615
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:27,368
But daddy, this is so quick.
I mean, you only met her last night.

616
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:29,533
It was the same with your mother.

617
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:33,576
- At least with mom you waited a week.
- Your mother and I knew on the first night.

618
00:55:33,672 --> 00:55:36,210
Are you crazy? You don't know
a thing about her.

619
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:40,083
- I know all I need to know.
- I've already gone through this, Uncle Ron.

620
00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:41,803
She's after your money!

621
00:55:41,888 --> 00:55:45,720
Ron, I don't even have a ball of lint
and a lead slug to rub together.

622
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,516
She's got a trust fund.

623
00:55:47,685 --> 00:55:49,263
She has a trust fund?

624
00:55:51,731 --> 00:55:54,934
You know, I don't get it.
Why does this happen to you?

625
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,892
I know! Citizenship!
She wants citizenship.

626
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:02,523
She wants to take jobs away from
Americans and give 'em to Dutch people!

627
00:56:02,616 --> 00:56:04,490
Yeah, thas why she's here.

628
00:56:05,453 --> 00:56:06,911
But is so unfair.

629
00:56:07,163 --> 00:56:08,989
I mean, you know...

630
00:56:09,373 --> 00:56:12,956
Is my own brother marrying
the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.

631
00:56:13,043 --> 00:56:14,870
And he met her at my apartment.

632
00:56:15,921 --> 00:56:17,960
Ron, I appreciate your concern.

633
00:56:18,173 --> 00:56:19,917
This is something I really want.

634
00:56:20,008 --> 00:56:23,626
Haven't you wanted something so much
that nothing else mattered?

635
00:56:23,845 --> 00:56:25,885
Is your wedding, I'm gonna tell you.

636
00:56:25,972 --> 00:56:29,388
There's only one woman in the world
that I will ever marry.

637
00:56:31,645 --> 00:56:33,602
Princess Stephanie of Monaco.

638
00:56:34,272 --> 00:56:35,268
Really?

639
00:56:36,065 --> 00:56:39,849
I never knew you had a thing for her.
What makes her the lucky lady?

640
00:56:40,403 --> 00:56:43,155
Because she's the most perfect
woman in the world.

641
00:56:43,239 --> 00:56:45,030
She'd have nothing to do with me.

642
00:56:45,116 --> 00:56:48,699
Ron, brush up on your French lessons
and your tennis, maybe ill happen.

643
00:56:48,786 --> 00:56:52,866
But right now I'm going to marry
my Princess Stephanie. So wish me luck.

644
00:56:53,499 --> 00:56:55,657
You've had too much luck already.

645
00:56:58,796 --> 00:57:01,583
Where did she get a wedding dress
on two hours notice?

646
00:57:01,674 --> 00:57:05,007
Does she just carry one around with her,
in case of emergencies?

647
00:57:05,094 --> 00:57:08,676
I hope so. Now would you go downstairs
and please be best man?

648
00:57:09,806 --> 00:57:12,843
- Uncle Ron, go!
- You wanna see my date? She's 6 foot 2.

649
00:57:16,563 --> 00:57:17,476
Okay.

650
00:57:18,648 --> 00:57:20,641
Go and tell Celeste is time.

651
00:57:29,492 --> 00:57:31,319
I'll have to leave you on the chair.

652
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:32,869
Can'c you wear me?

653
00:57:33,162 --> 00:57:34,906
No, I'd look too strange.

654
00:57:35,373 --> 00:57:36,618
I'm so hungry.

655
00:57:36,707 --> 00:57:39,245
Good ching we scopped
ac che hardware score.

656
00:57:40,002 --> 00:57:43,537
D- cells. Primicive, buc nucricious.

657
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:05,442
- Dad, she ate batteries!
- What?

658
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:08,812
She took three "D" batteries
out of a paper bag and ate them.

659
00:58:08,905 --> 00:58:11,230
She flattened them
like a Tootsie Roll wrapper.

660
00:58:11,324 --> 00:58:14,693
And she was talking to
someone who wasn't even in the room.

661
00:58:17,372 --> 00:58:19,660
I love you more than anyone else
in the world.

662
00:58:19,749 --> 00:58:23,581
- Nothing's going to come between us.
- Daddy, she ate batteries.

663
00:58:24,504 --> 00:58:27,077
Jessie, I want you to stop this right now.

664
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:48,333
Back off, Alpo breach.

665
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,280
Dearly beloved...

666
01:00:20,157 --> 01:00:23,111
Sic/ Roll over/ Play dead/

667
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:29,411
I've only known Celeste for eight minutes,
but I can tell she has love for Steve...

668
01:00:30,042 --> 01:00:32,414
...who I've also known for eight minutes.

669
01:00:32,628 --> 01:00:34,869
You're digging your own grave, Fido.

670
01:00:35,172 --> 01:00:37,330
And do you Celesce van Marcin...

671
01:00:37,716 --> 01:00:39,258
...cake Sceven Mills...

672
01:00:39,593 --> 01:00:42,712
...co be your lawfully wedded husband?
In sickness...

673
01:00:48,143 --> 01:00:51,512
For richer and or poorer,
cil deach do you parc?

674
01:00:52,188 --> 01:00:54,679
- I do.
- I now pronounce you man and wife.

675
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,163
"I'm looking over my dead dog Rover"

676
01:01:11,248 --> 01:01:14,166
- Get that dog down!
- You lefc me alone again/

677
01:01:14,251 --> 01:01:15,876
I was getting married!

678
01:01:16,545 --> 01:01:17,576
Honey!

679
01:01:18,255 --> 01:01:19,536
What happened?

680
01:01:20,049 --> 01:01:23,998
Maybe is a Dutch custom. They say
"I do," bolt for the lawn and start digging.

681
01:01:24,094 --> 01:01:26,051
Maybe she's planting tulip bulbs.

682
01:01:26,138 --> 01:01:29,637
Honey, how on earth
did Dave get up there! Look!

683
01:01:29,766 --> 01:01:31,391
Dave! Don't move!

684
01:01:32,894 --> 01:01:35,017
Volunteers! Jeff, Woody!

685
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:44,729
May I be the first to kiss the bride?

686
01:01:44,822 --> 01:01:45,818
Sure.

687
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:56,488
I got him!

688
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:43,996
Where'd you get this dress?

689
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,413
Is him! Quick, dad, the brush!

690
01:02:48,801 --> 01:02:51,422
I'm coming. Here it is. I've got it here.

691
01:02:51,762 --> 01:02:53,138
The brush.

692
01:02:53,597 --> 01:02:55,139
Okay. Easy.

693
01:03:02,231 --> 01:03:03,689
My God, you look beautiful.

694
01:03:03,774 --> 01:03:05,932
Thanks, dad. I hope he likes me.

695
01:03:06,568 --> 01:03:08,110
I hope you like him.

696
01:03:14,201 --> 01:03:16,193
Hi. I'm Fred. The date.

697
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,328
These are for you, doll.

698
01:03:19,497 --> 01:03:20,778
Thank you.

699
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:23,291
I'm Steve, Jessie's dad.

700
01:03:23,918 --> 01:03:25,875
- This is Mrs. Mills.
- Nice to meet you.

701
01:03:25,962 --> 01:03:27,242
Mouth jewellery.

702
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:33,212
Right, my braces.

703
01:03:33,344 --> 01:03:35,337
My wife's from Holland, so...

704
01:03:37,682 --> 01:03:39,390
You wore flats. Great.

705
01:03:43,479 --> 01:03:44,890
Have a great time.

706
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:46,890
She'll be safe with me, sir.

707
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:50,356
Bye.

708
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:53,146
Did that kid look shifty to you?

709
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,320
Hadn't you better get back to work now?

710
01:03:55,407 --> 01:03:58,408
What? You gotta be kidding,
on our wedding night?

711
01:04:00,412 --> 01:04:02,784
I don't think so.

712
01:04:07,836 --> 01:04:09,247
God, I love you!

713
01:04:24,477 --> 01:04:26,516

Carl Sagan?

719
01:04:42,995 --> 01:04:44,109

We can'c afford co wasce
billions and billions of dollars.

728
01:05:09,562 --> 01:05:11,354
Have I made myself clear, Meachead?

729
01:05:11,522 --> 01:05:12,637
Yes. I...

730
01:05:13,608 --> 01:05:16,015
- And how's Skippy?
- She's fine.

731
01:05:16,444 --> 01:05:18,271
Tell her I asked afcer her.

732
01:05:18,905 --> 01:05:20,897

734
01:05:24,618 --> 01:05:26,113

Bravo, Bag.

Now we've goc co gec Dr. Sceve

737
01:05:34,044 --> 01:05:37,128
You're right. He should have no excuses
not to work.

738
01:05:58,193 --> 01:05:59,817
Hands on che wheel/

739
01:06:33,393 --> 01:06:34,935
Thas what we need.

740
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:19,679
$416.80.

741
01:07:27,571 --> 01:07:28,769
Whas this?

742
01:07:29,406 --> 01:07:30,437
Is a diamond.

743
01:07:30,532 --> 01:07:34,482
I'm sorry, we don't take diamonds
at this branch. Money only.

744
01:07:44,504 --> 01:07:46,662
Haven't you got anything smaller?

745
01:08:03,939 --> 01:08:05,102
What did I just do?

746
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:09,437
Ic's called a sneeze. From che flour.
Buc only humans are supposed co do ic.

747
01:08:09,528 --> 01:08:11,152
Whac did ic feel like?

748
01:08:14,116 --> 01:08:15,278
Very funny.

749
01:08:15,826 --> 01:08:18,862
Very good. Very liberating.

750
01:08:21,873 --> 01:08:23,451
This is my house.

751
01:08:24,876 --> 01:08:28,245
I actually had a good time.
Maybe we can do it again sometime.

752
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:30,580
Maybe next time we can even dance.

753
01:08:31,716 --> 01:08:33,376
- I am starving.
- Okay.

754
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,822
Just what I needed.

755
01:09:01,912 --> 01:09:03,905
I could have a banquet down this block.

756
01:09:03,997 --> 01:09:05,575
We've goc work co do.

757
01:09:06,124 --> 01:09:07,287
All right.

758
01:09:36,821 --> 01:09:38,813
Did you see Uncle Ron's new invention?

759
01:09:38,906 --> 01:09:42,571
Is an all-snap shirt where
the snaps look like buttons. Great?

760
01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:45,368
Except they rust in the wash.

761
01:09:46,914 --> 01:09:48,953
- Good morning, dear.
- Good morning.

762
01:09:49,041 --> 01:09:52,624
- I made you breakfast, my family.
- So thas what you've been up to?

763
01:09:52,711 --> 01:09:54,039
Did you sleep well?

764
01:09:55,005 --> 01:09:55,835
Yes.

765
01:09:55,923 --> 01:09:57,037
Did you?

766
01:10:02,596 --> 01:10:03,627
Hello.

767
01:10:04,848 --> 01:10:06,046
Dr. Budlong.

768
01:10:06,558 --> 01:10:07,756
How are you?

769
01:10:08,518 --> 01:10:09,929
Fine. Thank you.

770
01:10:11,896 --> 01:10:14,268
No, I don't know Dr. Sagan personally.

771
01:10:16,067 --> 01:10:18,736
The Presidens Most Secret
None More Secret?

772
01:10:27,286 --> 01:10:28,994
I've been thinking, too.

773
01:10:29,246 --> 01:10:32,164
About the explosion
and the damage and everything.

774
01:10:33,501 --> 01:10:37,035
Really? You mean it?

775
01:10:37,755 --> 01:10:39,332
When can I start back?

776
01:10:40,924 --> 01:10:43,380
No, not today. Today's my honeymoon.

777
01:10:45,470 --> 01:10:46,715
A foreign gal.

778
01:10:46,972 --> 01:10:48,549
She's a head-spinner.

779
01:10:51,059 --> 01:10:52,055
Fine.

780
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:59,692
Thank you. Surely you and Skippy
must remember from your own experience.

781
01:11:00,485 --> 01:11:03,569
This is Mrs. Mills. Ignore my husband
on anything but science.

782
01:11:03,655 --> 01:11:06,442
He'll be there in 15 minutes.
Maybe less. Yes, bye.

783
01:11:06,699 --> 01:11:10,483
Sweetie, wait a minute. I don't wanna
go to work today. Is our honeymoon.

784
01:11:10,578 --> 01:11:12,369
I wanna clean the place up for you.

785
01:11:12,455 --> 01:11:14,329
I'll clean the house so you don't see a dust.

786
01:11:14,415 --> 01:11:17,084
I'm Dutch. Did you ever see
a dirty street in Hague?

787
01:11:17,168 --> 01:11:18,792
We are ready to clean.

788
01:11:19,503 --> 01:11:23,038
Great, les do it together.
And we can watch my Durante tapes.

789
01:11:23,132 --> 01:11:25,705
Les put an end
to this silly argument right now.

790
01:11:25,801 --> 01:11:28,292
I'll arm-wrestle you for it. Winner cleans.

791
01:11:28,387 --> 01:11:30,593
You sure you really want to do this?

792
01:11:30,681 --> 01:11:31,712
Come on.

793
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:37,976
One, two, three. Okay, lady wins.
Now les eat right up and get to work.

794
01:11:39,439 --> 01:11:41,895
Thas quite a forearm you've got there.

795
01:11:41,983 --> 01:11:43,442
And remember the thrust.

796
01:11:43,527 --> 01:11:47,109
Four hundred megawatts and lightning
isn't enough to go extragalactic.

797
01:11:49,324 --> 01:11:52,408
- Whas this?
- Your martini. Would you like one, dear?

798
01:11:52,494 --> 01:11:53,739
No, thank you.

799
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:01,168
And finally your turkey.

800
01:12:02,462 --> 01:12:03,707
Dig right in.

801
01:12:03,838 --> 01:12:08,215
Eat fast, solve all your problems,
and fulfil yourself. I'll make the beds.

802
01:12:13,514 --> 01:12:14,545
Quite a spread.

803
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,345
Daddy, don't you think
this is pretty strange?

804
01:12:17,685 --> 01:12:19,808
Your stepmother's just full of surprises.

805
01:12:19,895 --> 01:12:21,437
I know how happy you are...

806
01:12:21,522 --> 01:12:25,471
...and I wouldn't do anything in the world
to get in the way of that happiness.

807
01:12:25,567 --> 01:12:28,189
- But last night, after my date...
- Your date?

808
01:12:28,362 --> 01:12:29,642
How'd your date go?

809
01:12:29,738 --> 01:12:32,941
Fine, but Dad, I saw her drink
the battery juice from your Honda.

810
01:12:33,033 --> 01:12:33,779
Jessie!

811
01:12:33,867 --> 01:12:37,699
Not only that, I saw her lift
a burning hot pan with her bare hands!

812
01:12:38,371 --> 01:12:40,945
Now I wish I didn't have to go to the lab.

813
01:12:41,291 --> 01:12:42,750
- Your new mother...
- Stepmother!

814
01:12:42,834 --> 01:12:45,076
Stepmother loves you very much.

815
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:47,661
She's concerned that she won't fit in
around here.

816
01:12:47,755 --> 01:12:49,499
She knows there'll be problems...

817
01:12:49,591 --> 01:12:53,802
Dad, if the car won't start, will you
at least give me the benefit of the doubt?

818
01:13:02,561 --> 01:13:05,432
Nothing happened, Jess.
You must have dreamed it.

819
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:14,361
- Bye.
- Not you.

820
01:13:15,783 --> 01:13:17,941
We do che resc of che house in 14 seconds.

821
01:13:18,035 --> 01:13:21,285
Then Council provides che lighcning.
He does che cransmission...

822
01:13:21,371 --> 01:13:23,779
...and we head che 92 lighc years home.

823
01:13:38,763 --> 01:13:40,590
Setty Lab. This is Mills.

824
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:43,725
Dad, come home right away.
The house is on fire.

825
01:13:47,522 --> 01:13:50,606
You can't leave now! What if we get rain?

826
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:53,690
Jessie!

827
01:13:55,071 --> 01:13:56,185
Stay away from me.

828
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,154
No, is not what you think.

829
01:14:06,457 --> 01:14:07,867
You are an alien!

830
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:18,213
Oh, my God!

831
01:14:24,724 --> 01:14:25,969
And you/

832
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:28,804
Quiec/

833
01:14:32,899 --> 01:14:34,808
- Bag, let her down!
- Noc yec.

834
01:14:35,068 --> 01:14:36,478
What do you want?

835
01:14:36,736 --> 01:14:38,859
We're from Co-sign into the Eighth.

836
01:14:38,946 --> 01:14:41,864
Ninety-two light years
and two solar systems away.

837
01:14:42,533 --> 01:14:46,400
Your father penetrated our atmosphere
with a radar beam nine days ago.

838
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:50,788
We must duplicate that transmission
in 12 hours...

839
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,996
...or our civilisation will be destroyed.

840
01:14:54,169 --> 01:14:57,787
Is that why you're here?
But he doesn't know how he did it!

841
01:14:58,257 --> 01:15:00,582
- We assume thas a lie.
- No, is not.

842
01:15:01,343 --> 01:15:04,510
You should know him well enough
to know he doesn't lie.

843
01:15:05,222 --> 01:15:08,341
Could that be the truth?
Could it be it was just an accident?

844
01:15:08,433 --> 01:15:11,268
No/ The ceenager is lying, coo.

845
01:15:12,103 --> 01:15:13,895
No, I don't think so.

846
01:15:14,356 --> 01:15:16,977
We have to find out
or we'll never be able to leave.

847
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:19,640
Leave? But what about my father?

848
01:15:20,069 --> 01:15:23,984
He loves you. For the first time
in five years he loves someone.

849
01:15:24,449 --> 01:15:27,533
You're gonna kill that in him.
He'll never recover.

850
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:30,661
Celesce doesn'c care. Righc, Celesce?

851
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:32,611
Righc, Celesce?

852
01:15:33,416 --> 01:15:34,447
Right.

853
01:15:37,128 --> 01:15:39,453
If you don't say anything,
we'll let you down.

854
01:15:39,547 --> 01:15:40,792
No, we won'c/

855
01:15:41,215 --> 01:15:43,207
I'm in charge of this mission.

856
01:15:43,926 --> 01:15:46,298
Will you not tell your father
until we've gone?

857
01:15:46,387 --> 01:15:48,463
Yes, just don't hurt him.

858
01:15:54,269 --> 01:15:55,680
- Let her down.
- Celesce/

859
01:15:55,771 --> 01:15:57,229
Let her down!

860
01:15:59,941 --> 01:16:01,898
That wasn't necessary.

861
01:16:05,905 --> 01:16:07,732
Give the dog back his bark.

862
01:16:08,116 --> 01:16:10,239
Celesce, your accicude sucks.

863
01:16:14,247 --> 01:16:16,654
- Ciao, baby.
- Whas this about a fire?

864
01:16:18,418 --> 01:16:19,366
Daddy!

865
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,619
You said there was a fire!
Whas going on?

866
01:16:21,712 --> 01:16:24,038
I had to say there was a fire.
What was I to say?

867
01:16:24,131 --> 01:16:26,124
"The living room's spotless, come home. "

868
01:16:26,217 --> 01:16:28,126
Why did you call me? Why did you lie?

869
01:16:28,219 --> 01:16:31,837
I had to. Daddy, you married a person
from another planet.

870
01:16:31,931 --> 01:16:33,674
Celeste doesn't come from Holland.

871
01:16:33,766 --> 01:16:37,384
She comes from a place 92 light years
and two solar systems away.

872
01:16:37,561 --> 01:16:39,767
Not again. You're going in for counselling.

873
01:16:39,855 --> 01:16:44,066
She does. She took away Dave's bark
and put me on the ceiling for ten minutes.

874
01:16:46,194 --> 01:16:48,401
Celeste is not from another planet.

875
01:16:49,322 --> 01:16:51,398
Your stepmother is not an alien.

876
01:16:52,409 --> 01:16:56,027
I mean, please, this is a fantasy.
Don't you think I know aliens?

877
01:16:56,663 --> 01:16:58,406
Is my business to know.

878
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:00,657
Why do we never see her eat or sleep?

879
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:04,368
And how come we suddenly get
a new living room in one afternoon?

880
01:17:05,255 --> 01:17:07,828
And inside that bag there's a horrible eye.

881
01:17:09,092 --> 01:17:12,045
Just like why my car wouldn't start
this morning?

882
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:13,921
Just look inside.

883
01:17:18,476 --> 01:17:21,097
I come home from the lab
to look in a purse.

884
01:17:25,649 --> 01:17:27,558
Lipstick. Passion pink.

885
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:32,489
Mascara. Unusual for a purse, isn't it?

886
01:17:33,657 --> 01:17:36,777
Q- tips. An eye!

887
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:38,695
Jessie, there's no eye in here.

888
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:41,741
She made it disappear.
There was one in there.

889
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:45,041
And she did lift up the bacon
without a potholder.

890
01:17:45,543 --> 01:17:48,213
And what about all that food
she cooked for breakfast?

891
01:17:48,296 --> 01:17:50,668
You don't have an answer
and you won't believe me.

892
01:17:50,757 --> 01:17:54,707
And she's gonna be gone in 12 hours,
and why won't you listen to me?

893
01:17:54,928 --> 01:17:57,465
Now, honey, come on. Jessie, come here.

894
01:18:00,433 --> 01:18:02,342
Jessie, where are you going?

895
01:18:06,647 --> 01:18:08,355
Come back here, Jessie.

896
01:18:10,192 --> 01:18:11,355
Get off the street!

897
01:18:12,486 --> 01:18:15,689
Jessie, you bring that bike back here now!
Hey, come on.

898
01:18:17,491 --> 01:18:19,033
- Stop!
- Whas wrong?

899
01:18:22,162 --> 01:18:23,325
Come on!

900
01:18:49,814 --> 01:18:52,649
I'm sorry, I didn't see her. Is she all right?

901
01:18:53,401 --> 01:18:54,563
She's okay.

902
01:18:54,819 --> 01:18:56,230
I didn't see her.

903
01:18:56,404 --> 01:18:57,684
Is all right.

904
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:09,447
You gave yourself away to save my life.

905
01:19:27,934 --> 01:19:29,428
I'll be right back.

906
01:19:47,578 --> 01:19:49,322
Do you really have to go?

907
01:19:51,665 --> 01:19:53,991
Is the same on both our planets.

908
01:19:55,085 --> 01:19:58,170
Just when you get to know someone
they have to leave.

909
01:19:58,839 --> 01:20:02,967
My mom, I mean, my first mom,
had to leave, too.

910
01:20:04,470 --> 01:20:08,847
I know you have to go.
This isn't your home. I understand that.

911
01:20:12,686 --> 01:20:14,892
Can you at least wait till morning?

912
01:20:17,274 --> 01:20:18,305
I'll try.

913
01:20:54,393 --> 01:20:56,101
Where's your spaceship?

914
01:20:58,188 --> 01:20:59,896
Behind your moon, Steve.

915
01:21:00,315 --> 01:21:01,644
What do you do up there?

916
01:21:01,733 --> 01:21:05,316
Meditate? Plan how to break hearts?
If you know what they are.

917
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:12,192
We are where you will be in 55 centuries.
If you make it.

918
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:15,611
I'm 1,296 years old.

919
01:21:17,832 --> 01:21:20,406
We reproduce by synthesis in a petri dish.

920
01:21:21,586 --> 01:21:25,963
We use 104 percent of our brain capacity
as opposed to your 36 percent.

921
01:21:28,217 --> 01:21:30,755
Our lives are spent in perfect harmony...

922
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:35,840
...improving our civilisation with none of
the erratic highs and lows you have here.

923
01:21:36,142 --> 01:21:38,300
I see. Sort of like Switzerland.

924
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:41,763
Why do you reproduce in a petri dish?

925
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:44,560
We learned that sex was
inefficient and messy.

926
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,975
So you got rid of it, just like that?

927
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:50,232
I must admit, we were a little hasty
on that one.

928
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:53,655
You mean I married a virgin?
Mother would be proud.

929
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,915
Don't you ever do stuff like go on vacation?

930
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,327
Sure we do.

931
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,160
What do you do on vacation?

932
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:04,200
Math.

933
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:07,330
What do you do to have fun?

934
01:22:08,047 --> 01:22:09,079
Graphs.

935
01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:14,804
We go to warm places together
and hold hands.

936
01:22:18,641 --> 01:22:20,717
Is too bad you don't eat food.

937
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:23,479
You might find it could be
quite pleasurable.

938
01:22:24,021 --> 01:22:25,599
You get pleasure out of food?

939
01:22:25,689 --> 01:22:27,267
- Here.
- No, thank you.

940
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:30,276
If you want my secrets
you'll eat my sandwich.

941
01:22:36,492 --> 01:22:37,690
Chew!

942
01:22:52,257 --> 01:22:54,962
This is fun. What is it?

943
01:22:57,846 --> 01:22:59,922
Ham and cheese on rye with mayo.

944
01:23:01,266 --> 01:23:05,014
And I love the way it feels
against the roof of my mouth...

945
01:23:05,561 --> 01:23:07,554
...and the sides of my tongue.

946
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:09,141
This is fun.

947
01:23:09,774 --> 01:23:11,268
Here, wash it down.

948
01:23:19,283 --> 01:23:21,026
This makes me smile, too.

949
01:23:22,703 --> 01:23:24,411
Seagram's Scotch Whiskey.

950
01:23:28,542 --> 01:23:29,573
Celeste?

951
01:23:30,669 --> 01:23:32,247
Did you ever like me?

952
01:23:33,964 --> 01:23:37,463
Steve, of course I did. I do.

953
01:23:38,051 --> 01:23:39,759
It wasn't just physics?

954
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:45,008
No. If I were an Earth person
I would do exactly what we did.

955
01:23:45,642 --> 01:23:49,591
- It might have taken a little longer, but...
- Then why can't you stay?

956
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:52,684
I just can't.

957
01:23:52,857 --> 01:23:55,063
What if I never sent
the transmission again?

958
01:23:55,151 --> 01:23:58,022
Then nobody would be able
to use it against you ever.

959
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:01,699
Unfortunately thas not the history
of your planet.

960
01:24:01,782 --> 01:24:05,032
And if you don't do that transmission,
my planet will die.

961
01:24:08,789 --> 01:24:10,497
- Are you mad at me?
- Mad?

962
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:14,574
I'm furious. I'm confused, I'm upset,
I'm frustrated, I'm furious!

963
01:24:14,753 --> 01:24:18,087
You're everything I ever wanted
in a human and an extraterrestrial.

964
01:24:18,173 --> 01:24:21,091
If I send the transmission,
which I don't know how to do...

965
01:24:21,176 --> 01:24:22,884
...and save your planet, I lose you.

966
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:25,924
If I don't send it,
you stay but I kill a whole planet.

967
01:24:26,807 --> 01:24:28,846
But I'd make a lousy Earth person.

968
01:24:28,934 --> 01:24:31,603
I made way too much breakfast,
and the dog hates me.

969
01:24:31,686 --> 01:24:34,557
The dog loves you. We all love you.

970
01:24:35,774 --> 01:24:38,644
Don't you see, thas why is so hard.

971
01:24:40,069 --> 01:24:42,027
Thas why I'm so torn apart.

972
01:24:43,072 --> 01:24:44,615
I feel like Durante.

973
01:24:48,369 --> 01:24:50,990
"Did you ever have the feeling
that you wanted to go

974
01:24:51,080 --> 01:24:53,405
"Still had the feeling
that you wanted to stay

975
01:24:53,499 --> 01:24:55,657
"Knew it was right wasn't wrong

976
01:24:55,751 --> 01:24:57,411
"Go stay, stay go"

977
01:24:58,838 --> 01:25:00,581
Thas exactly how I feel.

978
01:25:00,881 --> 01:25:02,375
You know this song?

979
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:05,506
I feel just like you and Durante.

980
01:25:06,345 --> 01:25:09,262
I don't wanna go, but I can't stay.

981
01:25:10,974 --> 01:25:12,516
I feel only one way.

982
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:15,138
I want you to stay.

983
01:25:28,616 --> 01:25:31,783
Boy, talk about being tied to your work.

984
01:25:32,662 --> 01:25:36,161
I spend my whole career trying to prove
there's life on other planets...

985
01:25:36,249 --> 01:25:38,206
...and when I find it, I marry it.

986
01:25:44,507 --> 01:25:45,621
Lightning.

987
01:25:47,051 --> 01:25:48,462
You shocked me.

988
01:25:50,054 --> 01:25:52,971
Static electricity.
The metal in Ron's snaps.

989
01:25:59,605 --> 01:26:00,636
Snaps.

990
01:26:00,856 --> 01:26:02,101
Ron's buttons.

991
01:26:02,983 --> 01:26:04,940
The cage around the Klystron.

992
01:26:05,152 --> 01:26:07,358
Thas the wild card! Come on.

993
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:12,731
He knows.

994
01:26:14,035 --> 01:26:15,577
He's a true scientist.

995
01:26:15,662 --> 01:26:19,660
You realise, of course, as soon as
we've made concacc we'll have co leave.

996
01:26:21,835 --> 01:26:24,539
- I'm aware of that.
- Righc afcer we kill chem.

997
01:26:24,671 --> 01:26:27,506
- Kill them?
- Nocjusc chem. The whole ching.

01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:29,298
Whac do you call ic? Earch.

999
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:30,794
We're not killing anybody.

1000
01:26:30,885 --> 01:26:33,257
We'll get what we need
and leave Earth as we found it.

1001
01:26:33,346 --> 01:26:35,552
I'm afraid noc.
We're wiping ouc everyching.

1002
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:40,515
People, land mass, wacer.
The Council has cold me co cake care of ic.

1003
01:26:40,603 --> 01:26:42,263
We're not going to do anything.

1004

Jessie, sweetie! Is time.

Come on, get up.

1008
01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:09,542
Be careful.

1009
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:45,998
Ron, ic's Celesce.

1010
01:27:47,292 --> 01:27:49,748

01:27:55,967 --> 01:27:59,134
Our physical relacionship

I need co calk co someone.
I need co calk co you.

1015
01:28:04,017 --> 01:28:07,801

Could you come co che lab, and we
could discuss chese maccers of che flesh?

1017
01:28:14,026 --> 01:28:18,605
The flesh? Yes, sure.
But, I mean, he's my brother.

1018
01:28:19,323 --> 01:28:21,945
Buc we don'c need co cell Sceve everyching.

01:28:33,879 --> 01:28:37,082
This is terrible. What am I going to do?
He's my own brother!

1022
01:28:37,174 --> 01:28:39,416
This is terrible. My own brother!

1023
01:28:40,552 --> 01:28:41,833
And yet.

1024
01:28:59,821 --> 01:29:02,987
Where've you been all day?
This rain could stop at any minute.

1025
01:29:03,074 --> 01:29:05,612
Grady, we need a conductor. A conductor.

1026
01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:08,699
Solid tin.

1027
01:29:09,872 --> 01:29:12,197
Next year when they give out
that Nobel Prize...

1028
01:29:12,291 --> 01:29:14,747
...I'll be up there, and I'll tell them about...

1029
01:29:14,835 --> 01:29:16,294
Steve, darling.

1030
01:29:25,387 --> 01:29:29,052
See what did it? Ronnie put his jacket
on the chair and it had brass buttons.

1031
01:29:29,141 --> 01:29:30,516
It was a short circuit.

1032
01:29:30,601 --> 01:29:34,598
Electrical impulse bouncing between
the Klystron and the fried buttons.

1033
01:29:34,688 --> 01:29:37,261
It threw the power way beyond
400 megawatts!

1034
01:29:41,194 --> 01:29:42,854
Telescope's all set, Dr. Mills.

1035
01:29:42,946 --> 01:29:45,781
You won't forget to tell Dr. Sagan
how helpful I've been?

1036
01:29:45,865 --> 01:29:47,359
Carl Sagan? Sure.

1037
01:29:48,201 --> 01:29:50,158
Now all we need is the lightning.

1038
01:29:50,495 --> 01:29:52,820
Watch the monitors.
Thas where the action is.

1039
01:29:52,914 --> 01:29:54,574
All right, put these on.

1040
01:29:55,875 --> 01:29:57,120
Put those on.

1041
01:29:58,294 --> 01:29:59,753
Okay, set your attractors.

1042
01:29:59,837 --> 01:30:01,296
Set your attractors.

1043
01:30:02,423 --> 01:30:04,332
Steve, I have to talk to you.

1044
01:30:04,925 --> 01:30:05,874

Great! Nothing's changed here!

1054
01:30:52,096 --> 01:30:53,175

I'll be damned!

1057
01:31:03,357 --> 01:31:04,685
We did it again!

1058
01:31:04,858 --> 01:31:05,890
Science!

1059
01:31:06,902 --> 01:31:08,978

1060
01:31:09,071 --> 01:31:10,980
I am in love with your wife.

She's in love with me.
Is a whole thing. We gotta talk.

1062
01:31:15,535 --> 01:31:16,864
Get rid of that bag.

1063
01:31:16,995 --> 01:31:17,991
The bag?

1064
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:20,238
That bag will destroy your planet.

1065
01:31:21,625 --> 01:31:24,875
Babe, I love ya, we'll get rid of the bag.
I mean, whas in it?

1066
01:31:24,961 --> 01:31:27,997

You do a woman a favour
and the eye in her purse attacks you.

1073
01:32:44,705 --> 01:32:46,329
Is the pocketbook dead?

1074
01:32:46,415 --> 01:32:49,784
Of course, you nincompoop.

Our gravicy has already begun co reverc.
We have been saved.

Why has chis planec noc been dispacched?

1080
01:33:18,029 --> 01:33:20,698
You never said you were going
to destroy this place.

We musc/ They know how co descroy us.

1082
01:33:23,743 --> 01:33:26,993
Council, Dr. Mills never meant
to hurt anyone.

1083
01:33:27,204 --> 01:33:30,869
There are too many strange and
good things that go on here to destroy it.

1084
01:33:30,958 --> 01:33:33,875
They have war, chey have indifference,
chey have suffering.

1085
01:33:33,961 --> 01:33:36,203
Yes, but they also have jitterbugs.

And making love.

1091
01:33:48,433 --> 01:33:49,596
And sneezes.

1092
01:33:49,684 --> 01:33:50,799
Sneezes?

1093
01:33:50,936 --> 01:33:52,596

If you say so.

1159
01:39:24,425 --> 01:39:26,832
They all look like Princess Stephanie.

1160
01:39:32,766 --> 01:39:34,510
Can I ask you a question?

1161
01:39:38,021 --> 01:39:40,429

Ron, are you sure you want to do this?
You're making a pretty radical move here.

1167
01:40:12,263 --> 01:40:14,635
They all look like Princess Stephanie.

They do, don't they?

1169
01:40:21,188 --> 01:40:22,563
Time's wasting.

Where are the keys to your beachhouse?
