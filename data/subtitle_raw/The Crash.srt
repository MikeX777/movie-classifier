1
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:06,465
Thanks, Jill.

2
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:19,745
Oh, good, Jeff--

3
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,247
yeah, we'll hear all about your
ideas in the room, all right?

4
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,782
With all due respect, Jeff...

5
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,551
I don't think we need a
cyber-security firm right now...

6
00:01:25,553 --> 00:01:27,519
I think we need the president...
And a plan.

7
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,756
I can put a team on the ground
to attack in a matter of momen--

8
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,758
this isn't a terrorist cell
out of Damascus.

9
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,394
We can't just blow up
the Internet.

10
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:37,296
This is a single server
we're talking about here.

11
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,098
The possibilities are endless.

12
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,532
I understand very well the
complexities of the Internet.

13
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,533
I don't think you do. Oh, I do.

14
00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:43,469
Gentlemen, please let me finish.

15
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:45,571
These terrorists sent text
messages...

16
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:47,306
To very specific cell phones.

17
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:50,375
Only individuals directly
connected to the markets.

18
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,311
I don't know why they'd warn
the rich stockbrokers...

19
00:01:52,313 --> 00:01:53,645
But they said that they've
already hacked...

20
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:55,247
The New York stock exchange
backup.

21
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:57,382
We ran a security protocol
and it checks out.

22
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,418
- We found a breach.
- Jeff?
- Yes, Sarah?

23
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,121
There will absolutely be a run
on the banks. On everything.

24
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:05,491
And eventually if we cross our
fingers, and pray hard enough...

25
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:07,326
And we get the markets back
online, those, too.

26
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,794
You're assuming that this
is what...

27
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,530
Puts the public over the edge,
the tipping point.

28
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,764
That's right. Finally
revolting.

29
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,366
Getting up off their couches.
Yes!

30
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,368
Running to the bank to get the--
yes. Yes. Yes.

31
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,137
Stuff it in their mattress?
Yes, that is what I'm saying.

32
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,806
We are not looking at
bankruptcy.

33
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:25,244
We'd like to present an option.

34
00:02:25,246 --> 00:02:28,547
These terrorists used a stolen
software program...

35
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,215
To hack the market.

36
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:33,318
This is the man who created it
six months ago...

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
To increase his company's
earnings on the...

38
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,856
Mercantile exchange by about
a billion dollars.

39
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:41,193
I think we bring him in,
see if has any ideas.

40
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,928
That's ridiculous. I'm sorry,
Paul?

41
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,330
You can't be serious.
Guy Clifton, guy Clifton...

42
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,765
Helped revolutionize how
cities consolidate...

43
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,433
He's in the middle
of a federal hearing.

44
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,269
...and manage debt.
He's about to be indicted.

45
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:51,470
Guy Clifton is being indicted
because he broke through...

46
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:52,804
The same firewalls these
terrorists have.

47
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:56,542
Excuse me. Who the hell
is guy Clifton?

48
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,446
<i>Announcer the barometer</i>
<i>of America's prosperity...</i>

49
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,515
<i> Traditionally has been the</i>

50
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,487
<i> The New York stock exchange</i>

51
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,621
<i> As America</i> itself...

<i> Being founded in 1792...</i>

53
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,693
<i> During George Washington's</i>
<i> first administration.</i>

54
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:22,601
<i> 67 years ago, 24 men met</i>

55
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,503
<i> At 68 wall street</i>
<i> for the purpose...</i>

56
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,738
<i> Of trading and government</i>

57
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,845
<i> Wall street has become the</i>

58
00:03:36,816 --> 00:07:13,631
<i> Everybody, it seemed...</i>

59
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,918
<i> Was on the way to becoming</i>
<i> a millionaire.</i>

60
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,658
<i>There were plenty of buyers.</i>
<i>Not enough stock to go around.</i>

61
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,660
<i> Wait your turn.</i>
<i> It was unheard of.</i>

62
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:51,430
<i> Those who shouted the loudest</i>
<i> got in the firstest.</i>

63
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,902
<i> And then all of a sudden,</i>
<i> wham-o!</i>

64
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:00,772
<i> The next day, the Piper had</i>
<i> to be paid, and in full.</i>

65
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:04,610
<i> The incredible boom became an</i>

66
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:07,746
<i> As the country plunged into</i>
<i> the depths of a depression.</i>

67
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:16,455
<i>We made realistic rules so that</i>

68
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:19,324

69
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,792

70

<i> For America's ever growing</i>

71
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,832
All right, we're live
in five, four, three...

72
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:39,444
Guy Clifton, the man who just
two years ago...

73
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,413
Pulled Chicago out
of bankruptcy...

74
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,515
Is now facing multiple charges
in connection...

75
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,418
With an incident on the
Chicago mercantile exchange...

76
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,587
Where trading activity
was manipulated.

77
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,921
<i> Manipulated.</i>

78
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,857
<i> He rose fast through the</i>
<i> ranks...</i>

79
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,793
<i>Youngest ever to achieve a spot</i>
<i>on a mercantile exchange floor.</i>

80
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,362
<i>Quickly made a name for himself</i>
<i>and went on to found...</i>

81
00:04:57,364 --> 00:05:00,599
<i>Clifton holdings, before</i>
<i>assisting mayor rahm Emmanuel..</i>

82
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,501
Shut it off, please.

83
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,303
<i>...in eradicating Chicago's</i>
<i>debt entirely.</i>

84
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,071
<i> Ultimately though, money got</i>
<i> the better of him...</i>

85
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:08,707
<i> When he recruited three close</i>
<i> friends to hack...</i>

86
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:11,443
<i>The Chicago mercantile exchange</i>
<i>and manipulate...</i>

87
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,845
<i> His company's earnings</i>
<i> on the market.</i>

88
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:16,581
<i> We'll be right back with more</i>
<i> on this sad story of--</i>

89
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,830
hey.
Hi.

90
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:34,633
New book?
No, it's for school.

91
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,068
Ah...

92
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,609
You caught up at school?
Keeping up okay?

93
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:47,546
Did mom tell you to say that?

94
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:52,417
You're a wise-ass. No.

95
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,486
You know, the last time we
talked like this...

96
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:57,923
I think I was doing...

97
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:02,861
That stupid report
on local heroes.

98
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,664
Do you remember?

99
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,701
No.
No?

100
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,503
Yeah.

101
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:14,473
Well, my teacher told
the whole class...

102
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:17,542
That you had saved Chicago
from bankruptcy.

103
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,078
She said, "this, kids...

104
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,381
"Is the perfect example
of a local hero."

105
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,121
And now you're going to jail.

106
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:36,795
Was it just all for the money?
I think we have enough.

107
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,565
Who said that?

108
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,633
Mom says that.

109
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,001
Mom says I'm going to jail?

110
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:46,071
No, my econ teacher says
you're going to jail.

111
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,973
He says that's an absolute.

112
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:49,174
Ah, an absolute.

113
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:52,644
Mm-hm, mom says we have
too much money.

114
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,520
We've been awaiting the arrival
of guy Clifton...

115
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,754
For almost an hour now.

116
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,423
This must really be testing...

117
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,758
The judiciary committee members
inside, Paul.

118
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,127
Now, this is just an
informational hearing.

119
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:16,701
What do you think?
Should I call him?

120
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,103
Yeah, I'll call him.

121
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,019
Hey.

122
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,024
Where's creason?
Where's creason?

123
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,992
She left an hour ago.

124
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,594
Like everyone else.

125
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,563
Well, what did you think?

126
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:46,531
Everyone was just gonna wait
for you?

127
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:49,234
They're just looking to acquire
whatever information they can...

128
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,937
About how Mr. Clifton
and a team of three...

129
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,805
Were able to hack the market.

130
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,106
It just doesn't look good...

131
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,876
To keep a committee waiting
like this.

132
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,711
I revolutionized the market.
I found loopholes.

133
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,179
I've done things no one's
ever done before.

134
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:02,881
What are they gonna
indict me on?

135
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,649
You hacked the stock market.

136
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,151
No one's ever done that before.

137
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,086
It doesn't make it legal, guy.

138
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,621
Are you beginning to see...

139
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:11,223
That this is about more
than money, guy?

140
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,924
Let me tell you something.
It's always about money.

141
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,259
If I wasn't rich, they wouldn't
be indicting--

142
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:15,694
Mr. Clifton.

143
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,799
Yeah, can I help you, boys?
Guy Clifton?

144
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,001
Your presence has been
requested.

145
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,537
It's a matter of national
security, Mr. Clifton.

146
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:33,879
Really?

147
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,647
Please come with us.

148
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:38,617
Okay.

149
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,620
I have to go.

150
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:45,156
If you're not going straight to
jail, then dinner's at 8:00.

151
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:46,825
All right.

152
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,699
Do you have any idea where
they're taking him?

153
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,034
I do not.

154
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,969
No.

155
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:17,055
This way, Mr. Clifton.

156
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,829
"The government may try to
suppress us...

157
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,831
"But they will not
annihilate us."

158
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,268
"We seek justice against the
deceptive capitalist liars."

159
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,605
The backside decrypts to a map
of the United States...

160
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:37,676
Targeting the following cities
and their respective markets.

161
00:09:37,678 --> 00:09:41,012
Now, the specifics behind
motive and culprit...

162
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,847
Is classified at this point.

163
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,584
But I can tell you, they've
already breached...

164
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,719
The New York stock exchange
backup server.

165
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50,188
So, in front of you is the
review of my projections...

166
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,690
For total market failure.

167
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:52,991
And these are the new
international numbers...

168
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,793
You're getting now.
Thanks, Mel.

169
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,929
The reason why we're all here in
this room today, Ms. schwab.

170
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,297
So as I was--

171
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:03,902
sorry. So sorry.
Busy, busy day. Thank you.

172
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,972
Yeah, just get me a green tea.

173
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:09,975
Please... continue.

174
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,743
As I was saying, there is a
potential for this attack...

175
00:10:11,745 --> 00:10:13,345
To have global implications.

176
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:16,014
Hijacking our entire market
system could throw us into--

177
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,716
what is she talking about?
...Total market failure.

178
00:10:17,718 --> 00:20:35,434
Our economy's on track.

179
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:20,885
September 3rd, 1929,
we were on track, too.

180
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:22,921
One month later, less so.

181
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:26,891
This is not the
great depression, schwab.

182
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:30,295
People have lost faith
in the system.

183
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,331
Too big to fail is a thing
of the past.

184
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,133
Am I the only one in the room
who thinks...

185
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,368
It wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world...

186
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,402
To be a bit more prepared?

187
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,372
Prepared for what? Bankruptcy?

188
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:43,274
Correct.
Hm.

189
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,711
We have till Monday.

190
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:54,719
I want you to get me a list
of all our positions...

191
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:57,055
Long and short, everything
in the portfolio.

192
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,157
Then I want you to call my wife,
tell her I'm okay.

193
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,291
Clifton!

194
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,861
Yeah. Do that now, please.

195
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:06,831
Well, what do you think?

196
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,767
I think I'm gonna move
my money offshore.

197
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,702
That's what I think.

198
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:13,972
Come on. Help me fix this.

199
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:16,274
What's in it for me?

200
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,113
You'd better sell that mutual
fund, schwab.

201
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,923
Fuck. Douchebag.

202
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:33,825
What do you want for
dinner? I was thinking salmon...

203
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,126
Creason likes salmon.

204
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,263
I hate fish. I hate fish.
I hate fish.

205
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,365
We'll do salmon.

206
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,233
Who'd you give my office to?

207
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,468
You never used your office,
babe.

208
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,470
I used my office.
I used it once.

209
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,105
You know what else?

210
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,773
I gotta get your
access card back.

211
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,909
It's called the Clifton-Willis
foundation.

212
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,243
I know. Hold on.

213
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,878
Hey, can you get Andrew
on the phone?

214
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,313
I gotta talk about the--
i gotta go.

215
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,749
Wait. Hey, come back.
Come back!

216
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,191
You yell at me in the hallway?

217
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:07,959
Come back.

218
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,329
What?

219
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:20,305
Creason's rejecting the chemo
like they said she might.

220
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,509
Okay. Well, what do we do?

221
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,511
She's sad.

222
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:29,214
You should probably talk
to her...

223
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:31,750
Before they take you off
to prison.

224
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,163
I have Angela on the phone...

225
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,165
About the outreach program.

226
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,505
What?

227
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:56,341
What do they even have?
What do they got?

228
00:12:56,343 --> 00:13:00,912
Obstructing justice. Tampering.
You hijacked a market, too!

229
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,347
Oh, that's a bunch of bullshit.

230
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,850
Guy, I'd start making
preparations.

231
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,435
I'm sorry about all this,
Mr. Clifton. Take care.

232
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,009
<i>Announcer Clifton</i>
<i>manipulated the market...</i>

233
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,544
<i> In an unprecedented fashion.</i>

234
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,879
<i> This is all new in the age</i>
<i> of cyber warfare.</i>

235
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:36,915
<i> I mean, he's an American who</i>
<i> infiltrated the markets.</i>

236
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,483
<i> I think they'll have to come</i>
<i> down hard on him.</i>

237
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,485
<i> I really do. They have</i>
<i> to set an example.</i>

238
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:43,855
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

239
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,589
<i> Schwab</i>
<i> hello?</i>

240
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:19,190
Hey, it's guy Clifton.

241
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,558
<i> What can I do for you?</i>

242
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,300
Look, I think I have
a solution.

243
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:33,238
I'm gonna need immunity.

244
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,459
So, the attacks will hit
the computers that...

245
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,261
Tabulate the trades on all
the markets.

246
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,931
So we need to reroute our
markets...

247
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:01,900
To another computer's server...

248
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:03,368
One the hijackers don't
know about.

249
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,970
This is what I'll create...
Build.

250
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,305
Warm this up, please.

251
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,574
So the hackers don't know
it exists.

252
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,576
Is that possible?

253
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,146
Is that possible?

254
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,615
It's how he did it.

255
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,183
How he did what?

256
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,251
Well, he tried this before.
He attempted--

257
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,920
will it work?

258
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,154
I mean, if it's worked before...
It didn't work.

259
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:24,389
Support--
gentlemen, excuse me.

260
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,224
It's possible. It is possible.

261
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:27,392
He attempted to do it,
but it didn't work.

262
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,494
With your support--

263
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,596
and my team, we will do it.

264
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,099
Jeff, what he did is not
exactly legal.

265
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,168
This can be ready for the
markets by Monday?

266
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,305
Yeah, I just-- I need access
to the server codes.

267
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,713
So we're just gonna hand over
the keys to a market system.

268
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,148
Give us a minute, guy.

269
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,317
Sure.

270
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,518
Thanks for your time.

271
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,527
He's in the middle of a major
public indictment.

272
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,462
He's the only one who can
do this, Richard.

273
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,398
This happened in Hong Kong.

274
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,233
The markets dropped 38%
overnight...

275
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:10,735
And next day they recovered.

276
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,437
Right, but this is different.
I mean, there is...

277
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,672
These cyber threats have no
lasting implications..

278
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,307
On any market ever.

279
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,042
This is different.
You know this is different.

280
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,577
This is global.
Jeff, we've been through this.

281
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,245
Is his personal life in order?

282
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,048
Yes. He's good.

283
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,052
Okay.

284
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,421
Do me a favor.

285
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,557
Let me bring bankruptcy
projections to Jeff.

286
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:35,259
Runs on the goddamn bank.

287
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,295
Respectfully, I don't work
for the goddamn bank.

288
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,430
I work for the goddamn
white house.

289
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,670
This has to work.

290
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,672
I know.

291
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,640
Then you should also know this.

292
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,210
If it doesn't, they'll pull
your immunity.

293
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,513
Assemble the team.

294
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,656
I need you to talk to them.

295
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,358
Well, yeah, 'cause they all
fucking hate you.

296
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Yeah, I know that.

297
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,230
Well, if you know that, then
it's a non-starter, isn't it?

298
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,664
What am I supposed to tell
my board?

299
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,533
That I'm prancing around
collecting criminals...

300
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,201
For guy Clifton's latest
project?

301
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,337
I have a company to run,
too, guy.

302
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,139
It's a non-profit.

303
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:24,108
Did you really just fucking
say that?

304
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,576
It's your daughter's non-profit.

305
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:26,677
You know what you should tell
the board?

306
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:27,779
What?

307
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:30,648
That I get full immunity.

308
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,118
So that our daughter can
have two parents.

309
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,128
So, George, Amelia, who else?

310
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,530
Ben?

311
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:46,664
Ben.

312
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,433
Oh, Jesus Christ.

313
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:49,801
Yup.

314
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,377
Ben just went dark on me.

315
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,283
After you manipulated him into
hijacking an entire market.

316
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,684
I don't know. Maybe I could
put some feelers out.

317
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,286
I could--

318
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:10,655
you know, I could probably write
this program myself.

319
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,190
No, you can't.

320
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,858
I can.

321
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,328
I know where he is.

322
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,737
Hi.

323
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:28,106
Mrs. Clifton?

324
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,740
Babe, who is it?

325
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,743
Hey.

326
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,512
Who is it?

327
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,180
It's--

328
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,315
it's your mother.

329
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,450
What are you doing here?

330
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:43,287
Well, I've got some business
with Ben.

331
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,223
Business?
Yes.

332
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:47,358
I'll tell you about it later.

333
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,727
Should I have told you
about this?

334
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,662
Oh, I already knew about this.

335
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,870
I'll take a shower.

336
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,506
Okay?
Okay.

337
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,521
This is real.

338
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,590
We're just taking certain
things slow.

339
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,325
Oh, yes, I imagine she's
waiting to see...

340
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,593
If you turn out like her
father.

341
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,228
She's still in high school.

342
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,831
It's very mature of you
to recognize that.

343
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,833
<i> Man for Ben...</i>
Are you busy?

344
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,168
Yes.
<i>I'm calling from chase collec--</i>

345
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,303
oh. With what?

346
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,239
Coding. Algorithms.
The usual.

347
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,175
I've got a job for you.

348
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:42,446
I-- I don't think I'm cut out
for the non-profit sector.

349
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:44,615
Really? It's a good job.
High six figures.

350
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:46,751
Six figures?
No.

351
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:50,555
He's such a coward.

352
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,424
Sending his wife up here
to recruit for him.

353
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,727
He must be truly desperate.

354
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,829
And you know you can't trust
a desperate man.

355
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:03,401
He's not desperate, Ben.
He's sorry about what happened.

356
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,781
I felt like Einstein.
You felt like Einstein?

357
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,249
I felt like Einstein.

358
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:20,851
I felt like I developed
this amazing thing.

359
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:24,622
What do you mean, "turn out
like her father?"

360
00:20:24,624 --> 00:20:26,257
What?

361
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,358
You said creason's waiting
to see...

362
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,393
If I turn out like her father.

363
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,363
The markets.

364
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:35,833
It's all just fake numbers
and projections.

365
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:39,604
It's hard to stay truthful
in a world like that.

366
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:40,972
She doesn't want me
to be a trader.

367
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:42,707
She doesn't want you
to be a liar.

368
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,650
Will you do this job for me?

369
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,293
How'd it go?

370
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:03,861
Coward.

371
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,831
What does that mean?
Is he in?

372
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,599
You lied to that poor boy.

373
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,636
You made him hack the markets...
And he doesn't trust you.

374
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:13,504
I didn't lie to anybody.

375
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:16,407
My company created an algorithm.
He was an employee.

376
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,776
He stole from me.

377
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,314
Aw, fuck.

378
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,016
Do I go talk to him?

379
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:26,917
No.
No?

380
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,655
I'm gonna go talk to him.

381
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:33,024
He's in, guy.

382
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,864
Of course, he's in.
Of course, he's in.

383
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:42,767
Your daughter also just had
sex with him upstairs.

384
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,836
What?

385
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:51,342
Do you even know how
to drive a fucking car?

386
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:55,313
I need a barf bag like
they have in the airplanes.

387
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,815
She's the nurse the insurance
company gave me.

388
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,685
That's why she's retarded.
It wasn't my choice.

389
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:01,819
Jesus, George, calm down.

390
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,521
She fucking drives like
a maniac.

391
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:05,923
She's trying to fucking kill me.
It's ridiculous.

392
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,059
Crazy bitch.
I missed you.

393
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:11,896
This better be good.

394
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:12,963
Who's this?

395
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,532
Hey, George.

396
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:16,934
Oh my god, look at that hot
piece of ass.

397
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:20,805
Mm-mm... let's roll, nursie.

398
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:22,673
Keep it up. Keep it up.

399
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,109
Rolling.
Rolling with my nursie.

400
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,445
There's gonna be some boundaries
while we're here in my house.

401
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,946
Yeah?

402
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:30,047
Okay.

403
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,415
Okay.

404
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,517
Oh! Easy. I mean...

405
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,952
You want a hand?

406
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,787
Yeah, could somebody help
this thing in?

407
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,356
All right, come on.

408
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,127
These terrorists have hijacked
our central servers.

409
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,763
So, George, you're gonna
repatch the markets...

410
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,998
To a shadow server I found
in Iceland.

411
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,101
Ben, you'll use the program
we already created...

412
00:22:50,103 --> 00:22:52,536
To distribute information back
to the traders...

413
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,905
While Amelia monitors market
trends...

414
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,775
And transactional process.

415
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,013
Yes?

416
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:06,584
I got a two part question.

417
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:10,554
First, what happens if we
fail...

418
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:14,558
And second part, what's gonna
happen to the rest of the world?

419
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,826
We're not gonna fail.

420
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,061
The rest of the world
will be fine.

421
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,863
How can you be so sure?
You can guarantee?

422
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,898
We're not gonna fail because...
This is nothing new for us.

423
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,666
How can you be glib?

424
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,502
Because-- glib?

425
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,804
I'm not glib. I trust you.
We can do this.

426
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:27,972
We just need to focus.

427
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,440
Hi.

428
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,041
Hi.
Hi.

429
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,745
She got her mother's looks.

430
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,820
I know you all hate me right now
for what I've put you through...

431
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,555
And I don't blame you.

432
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:46,056
But not a single one of you
would have showed up...

433
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,426
If you didn't have something
to prove.

434
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:52,129
So, George, we're not going
to fail.

435
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,731
That's glib, my friend.

436
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,040
I found the spot.
It's low-key, secure.

437
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,508
I think it'll work just fine.

438
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,679
We're gonna need plausible
deniability.

439
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,954
It would be bad if you failed.

440
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,637
<i>Guy</i>
<i>the first thing I want to do...</i>

441
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,806
<i> Is route market observation</i>
<i> and analytics...</i>

442
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:38,909
<i> Through the living room here.</i>

443
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,711
<i> That's our control center.</i>

444
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,016
Amelia.
Yeah, I know.

445
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,852
You're not gonna be monitoring
one market like last time.

446
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:51,489
Every market.
Every market.

447
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:58,963
I feel like you're secretly
happy...

448
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:00,631
That I'm back in the house.

449
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:02,800
I don't think you should use
the word happy.

450
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:09,206
Guys, the floors! Guys!

451
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,775
$80 a square foot. Please.

452
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,511
What the fuck's going on?

453
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,145
What?

454
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,848
Are they gonna zip tie these
cables and hug 'em to the walls?

455
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,918
Yeah, guys, guys, let's zip
tie these cables...

456
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,987
Hug 'em to the walls.

457
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:26,857
George, I'm gonna put you
upstairs next to creason's room.

458
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,592
It'll be easiest to route the
network...

459
00:25:28,594 --> 00:25:29,593
Through the window up there.

460
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,863
Guy, are you serious? Shit.

461
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:36,567
What?
I can't climb stairs.

462
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:40,971
If I get up there and find
out...

463
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:45,576
You're in my wheelchair again,
so help me fucking god!

464
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:48,145
Hurry, hurry, it's not arts
and crafts.

465
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:51,549
So, Hong Kong on tech 3,
4 on board 1.

466
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,083
And then we're gonna do
Philadelphia.

467
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:58,322
Euro. Amsterdam.
Let's do Amsterdam 2, 1.

468
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:01,759
I said-- I said 4, 4.

469
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:02,793
You said 3, 4.

470
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:05,062
No, I said 4, 4.

471
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,231
No, you didn't.
Yeah, yeah, I did.

472
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,832
All right.

473
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,109
No? All right.

474
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:21,712
You don't got-- you don't got to
be such a bitch about it.

475
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:23,314
Come on.

476
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:26,250
Let's repatch this and then
let's get to London.

477
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,985
London on 2, 3.

478
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,057
That leaves one open room
for you, Ben.

479
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:36,894
The closet in my room.
It'll be nice and cozy.

480
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:38,362
Plenty of solitary focus...

481
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:40,965
For you to work out all the
programming kinks.

482
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,306
Oh, hey.

483
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:51,241
I think my mother's closet
really suits you.

484
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:52,943
This is ridiculous.

485
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,728
This status report is being
delivered...

486
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,096
To the white house as
we speak.

487
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:14,798
Clifton and his team are running
a diagnostic test.

488
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,800
A rehearsal, so to speak, to
work out the kinks.

489
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,636
This should last between
6 and 8 hours...

490
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:20,270
At which point they'll be ready
for market.

491
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:24,008
I've advised the white house
to prepare two speeches...

492
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,043
For the president to address
both outcomes.

493
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:28,812
But I have every confidence
Clifton will succeed.

494
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:32,149
<i>Automated voice</i>
<i>identification confirmed.</i>

495
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:35,019
<i> Patching you into the house</i>
<i> right now, Ms. schwab.</i>

496
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:39,657
Initiating the market
simulation.

497
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,360
Time to test this bad boy.

498
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:45,896
Ben, I'm sending you the London
to New York stuff now.

499
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:48,799
My price movements lagging
by maybe 15 minutes.

500
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:51,068
George, let's add Miami.

501
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:56,073
We have too many main market
patches running on board 2.

502
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:58,876
Retard, this is board 1
and this is board 2.

503
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,277
Come on, get with me, nurse.

504
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,412
You want to do it yourself?

505
00:28:01,414 --> 00:28:03,914
That's what she said.

506
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,850
<i>Let's add Miami to the</i>
<i>diagnostic, please.</i>

507
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:10,721
<i> Initiating Miami</i>
<i> simulation now.</i>

508
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:15,159
What are we waiting for?
There it is.

509
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:17,428
<i> Can I get an update</i>
<i> on the price movements?</i>

510
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:20,330
All right, we got major spikes
of activity in...

511
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:23,701
C-bot, Amsterdam and Atlanta.

512
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,836
George, let's get a status
update. George.

513
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:27,337
Hey. Hello? Hello!

514
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:28,439
Hello, I'm not doing this
for my health, okay?

515
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:30,140
Jesus, I can hear you upstairs.

516
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:31,942
I need to talk to people.

517
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,711
Try pressing the button on the
walkie-talkie.

518
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:35,379
Okay, we got major spikes
in activity in...

519
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,415
Amsterdam, c-bot and Atlanta.

520
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,385
Let's try rerouting a couple
of things, then.

521
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:58,769
Oh, shit.
Yeah.

522
00:28:58,771 --> 00:29:01,739
We don't have servers.
Hey, we got a problem.

523
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,775
I mean, this is fucking
ridiculous.

524
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:06,376
You got me working upstairs
in your wife's closet?

525
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:09,813
Hey, what's the issue?
You shut the-- nothing.

526
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:12,483
You're under surveillance.
This is what this looks like.

527
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:14,485
You stay the fuck away
from my daughter.

528
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:16,086
We don't have a server
big enough.

529
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,421
What about Amazon?

530
00:29:17,423 --> 00:58:34,844
We can't find a server big
enough.

531
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:23,193
We need 5% of the Internet.
The fastest 5%.

532
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,962
Zero latency bandwidth.

533
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,433
We need Facebook or netflix.

534
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:31,135
It's just not gonna work.
This is bullshit.

535
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,302
Unless somebody has a really
big fucking server...

536
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,238
That I don't know about.

537
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,939
I don't like this bullshit
as much as you don't like it.

538
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:36,940
It's a control kick.

539
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:38,208
Wait. Wait.

540
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,477
Control kick, my friend,
this is my daughter.

541
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,312
Probably.
Excuse me?

542
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,847
<i> We have a server.</i>

543
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:50,254
We have a server.

544
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:15,245
Oh, my gosh.

545
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,346
This is it?

546
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,015
Yup, this is it.

547
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:21,051
This is our post-9/11 backup
shadow stock market.

548
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:23,554
In a tug boat.
I know.

549
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:27,090
What is this?
What is this thing here?

550
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,425
Where's the server?

551
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:32,229
That's the server.
Over that barge.

552
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,931
It's all mobile.

553
00:30:41,439 --> 00:30:45,008
We moved it every 3 to 5 days
for security.

554
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,178
What can I say, it worked
for Saddam, until it didn't.

555
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,247
And it's all nuclear-powered.

556
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:52,115
And the only reason
it's still here...

557
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,550
Is we haven't figured out
how to dispose of it yet.

558
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,352
Oh, that's comforting.

559
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,421
Yeah, we cautioned the bush
administration that this...

560
00:30:57,423 --> 00:31:00,257
Unit would be shut down even
before they ever tested it.

561
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:05,128
But no one likes to listen to
what no one wants to hear.

562
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:06,563
Listen to what?

563
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,232
That the banks...

564
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:10,868
Would create their own backup
systems privately.

565
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,104
I mean, who do you trust less
than government?

566
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:16,306
Oh, I don't know. Banks?

567
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:24,448
Back-end server codes.
Have fun.

568
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,117
Well went dry on messengers?

569
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,053
Using highly classified
server codes...

570
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:31,989
To rewire the American
market system...

571
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:35,025
Isn't exactly a small thing.

572
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:39,930
And it would be negligent of me
not to stay informed.

573
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,410
Yeah.

574
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:56,647
You hacked the nasdaq and the
New York stock exchange.

575
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:58,615
He doesn't like that word.
I don't like that word.

576
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,450
See if you can get George to
patch this back to the house.

577
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,386
You held them for 11 hours.
And a half.

578
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:05,122
See if you can get George to
patch this back to the house.

579
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,024
You held nasdaq and the New York
stock exchange...

580
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:08,659
For 11 and a half hours.

581
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:10,360
What happened?
Something went wrong.

582
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:11,528
Was it with the program
you wrote?

583
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,963
Guy didn't write the program.

584
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:14,164
I developed the program.

585
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:15,465
You didn't develop it, either.

586
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:19,536
Guy? Guy?

587
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:20,704
Sarah.

588
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,206
Who wrote the program?

589
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,374
Who wrote the program?

590
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:26,043
Who wrote the program
is irrelevant.

591
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:28,211
What went wrong, guy?

592
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:31,048
You went wrong, Ben.
You went wrong.

593
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,016
So I never should have asked
you to do this.

594
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,718
You didn't ask me, you fucking
coward. Your wife asked me.

595
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,187
Fuck you. Fuck you.

596
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:41,692
You've been thinking about this
every waking goddamn second.

597
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,327
I was so close to the
finish line.

598
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:45,729
So close we could touch it.
Close to what?

599
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,597
Hacking our way to the top?

600
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:49,566
It doesn't matter how you get
to the mountain top, son.

601
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:53,337
You either make it or you don't.
We were there. We were there.

602
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:54,738
I used to believe what
you would say.

603
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,340
Stop with this...

604
00:32:56,342 --> 00:32:58,575
"I could have been a contender"
bullshit, all right?

605
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:01,345
You're a fucking criminal
and you can live with that.

606
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,660
Ben wrote the program.
Then he pulled the plug.

607
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:20,230
Why?

608
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,635
It was the right thing to do.

609
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,269
How are we going to handle this?

610
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:15,819
Handle what?

611
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:18,121
Handle creason.

612
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:21,792
How are we going to handle
creason?

613
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,195
She just can't carry on
with this stuff.

614
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:28,331
She's 18. He's 25.
I'll just forbid it.

615
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,067
You'll forbid it?
Yes.

616
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,701
Why? 'Cause it's what's
best for her?

617
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:34,538
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
This isn't about her.

618
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:37,174
Punish your daughter because
Ben has a moral compass?

619
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:39,743
Oh, obviously not a sexual
moral compass.

620
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,845
You know what I mean.

621
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:44,147
She can't see him anymore.
Period!

622
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,216
You have no idea what
he did to me.

623
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:49,486
He pulled a power play that day
to fuck me.

624
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:51,721
He's having sex with our
daughter to fuck me.

625
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:55,358
I don't know why he pulled the
plug, but Ben was doing...

626
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,694
The right thing, guy,
and you know that.

627
00:34:57,696 --> 00:35:00,263
Have you even talked to him
about it?

628
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,799
Fuck him.
Guy!

629
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,801
I can't. I'm not talking--
you are better than this.

630
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,109
You will not deny her this
experience.

631
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,461
Ben, you got a sec?

632
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:33,630
<i> Ben</i>
<i> what's up?</i>

633
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,298
Look, the board's not going
to approve...

634
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,833
This acquisition
next week...

635
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:40,504
Unless we can prove we're
worth the risk. Okay?

636
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:44,708
The company's valuation needs
to be presented differently.

637
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,444
I'd like to use the computer
program you wrote.

638
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,218
<i>Ben we need a team</i>
<i>to hack the market.</i>

639
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
<i> It's a grey area.</i>

640
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:59,623
<i> You should have legal look</i>
<i> into it first.</i>

641
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:41,464
It's gonna be different soon.

642
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:56,646
What do you think she'll say
when daddy saves the world?

643
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,949
She'll wonder why you didn't
come home for dinner.

644
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:19,636
<i> Announcer</i>
<i> all non-military...</i>

645
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:23,907
<i> Non-essential personnel</i>
<i> please clear the premise.</i>

646
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:28,778
<i> I repeat: All non-military,</i>
<i> non-essential personnel...</i>

647
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,681
<i> Please clear the premise.</i>

648
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:02,879
And we have every market
running the diagnostic.

649
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,282
It needs to cycle through
a few simulations.

650
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:07,050
Looks like it's working.

651
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:08,985
I'm going to take a break
for a while.

652
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,059
Well, what does that mean?

653
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,927
But-- I mean, if it's
unresponsive...

654
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:27,304
Well, do we up the dosage?
I mean, what do we do?

655
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,488
Well, we'll talk about it
when we come in. Okay.

656
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:48,858
What's up?

657
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,094
Hi.
You okay?

658
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:53,096
Yeah, I'm fine.

659
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,365
It sounded like it was
about creason.

660
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:57,801
It was.

661
00:38:57,803 --> 00:39:01,638
And?
Are you asking?

662
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,541
'Cause if you're asking, you
need to say something like...

663
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:07,711
"Shannon, what's happening
with creason?"

664
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:09,479
Or "Shannon, will you
loop me in...

665
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:10,780
With what the doctors
are saying?"

666
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:12,782
So will you--
say, "can I help you?"

667
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:15,852
Okay. Yeah, I can.
Shannon, loop me in...

668
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,387
With what the doctors
are saying.

669
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:18,822
I want to help you.

670
00:39:18,824 --> 00:39:21,491
It's fine. I can do it.
Okay.

671
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:23,827
Okay. Okay.

672
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,935
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.

673
00:39:31,937 --> 00:39:34,404
Okay.

674
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:52,422
Guy was the first one to take
a chance on me.

675
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:54,057
All the boys on the floor used
to look at me...

676
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,160
Like I was such a tight ass.

677
00:39:57,162 --> 00:40:04,667
And you know, he made a mistake,
but...

678
00:40:04,669 --> 00:40:06,770
It was just a mistake.

679
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,171
I don't even like this stuff.

680
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:11,875
And I could be so much richer,
but I am not.

681
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:14,944
Well, I'm flat broke.

682
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,694
Sing that thing.

683
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,463
What thing?

684
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:34,964
That thing you sing.
No.

685
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:38,201
Sing it. Sing it.
It's late.

686
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:57,220
Be. Hit the note.
Be.

687
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,122
Be.
Be.

688
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:20,643
Go back to sleep.

689
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:27,150
How come the FBI hasn't just...

690
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:31,888
Back traced any short sales
to November 15th...

691
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:35,825
Because then you could just, you
know, you could trace it to...

692
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,028
Shit, the--

693
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,798
terrorists.
Yes.

694
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,733
Thank you.
The terrorists.

695
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:46,135
And then who knows?

696
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:47,637
Right, who knows?

697
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:50,840
You're more than just a patcher.

698
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,042
You know what I'm gonna do?
What?

699
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,944
I'm gonna pull a bin laden.

700
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:56,913
Oh, yeah, you remember that?

701
00:41:56,915 --> 00:42:00,016
The family sold all their
stocks...

702
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:03,786
'Cause they knew the market was
gonna crash before 9/11.

703
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:08,024
So they short sold all their
united airlines stock...

704
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,126
The night before.

705
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:12,896
The night before.

706
00:42:12,898 --> 00:42:16,132
They made a fortune.

707
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:20,103
It'd be the first time I ever
made money on a trade.

708
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:21,971
You know?

709
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,973
That's an insider trade, George.

710
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:28,978
'Cause you could just trace
it to them.

711
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,582
To the, um--

712
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,284
terrorists.
Yeah, to the terrorists.

713
00:42:34,286 --> 00:42:35,985
Thank you very much.

714
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,160
Hey, I'm-- I'm sorry.

715
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:47,964
Nice chatting with you.

716
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:58,675
<i> Female agent</i>
<i> Jimmy, front entrance clear?</i>

717
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:00,710
<i> Do you copy?</i>

718
00:43:00,712 --> 00:43:02,946
I know, I said I'd just--

719
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:05,715
George took longer than usual
tonight, so.

720
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:13,723
Why would someone hack
the markets?

721
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:39,649
Oh, shit. Shit.

722
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:41,818
Shit, shit, shit.

723
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,236
Yeah? What?

724
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,072
Yeah.

725
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:10,747
I-- I know that, but I told
you that I'm working.

726
00:44:10,749 --> 00:44:13,082
I don't know what day I get off.

727
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:14,984
What's going on?

728
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,855
God, you look like shit.

729
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:20,289
I took a little nap.

730
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:24,727
You gotta look at this.
Look at that.

731
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:27,764
Look, I had a late night
with Amelia.

732
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:29,132
What am I looking at?
Something big came up...

733
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:30,833
So to speak.

734
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,169
All right, George. Where're you
going with this, man?

735
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,905
Okay, okay... the markets
are the target, right?

736
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,707
Right.

737
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:41,044
So why wouldn't the terrorists
be playing the market?

738
00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:46,349
Okay. So I traced all the short
sales from the 14th to the 16th.

739
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,685
You know, the usual suspects
came up.

740
00:44:48,687 --> 00:44:50,253
You know, you got China.
You got Iran.

741
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:52,021
You got--
i got it.

742
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,823
You got-- okay,
and I got nothing.

743
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:55,291
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I gotcha.

744
00:44:55,293 --> 00:44:58,094
And then I traced all the
American companies...

745
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:02,732
And I got all these
portfolios...

746
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:04,934
Owned and operated
by the big boys.

747
00:45:04,936 --> 00:45:09,038
Hey, look at this, look at this.
Take a look right there.

748
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,408
Jp Morgan, Wells Fargo,
assured technologies.

749
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,944
Is that b of a?
Mm-hm.

750
00:45:14,946 --> 00:45:18,281
Commodities. All right, they all
look like normal trends, though.

751
00:45:18,283 --> 00:45:20,049
Yeah, yeah, they're short...

752
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,918
But they're shorting everything
they can, you see that?

753
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,419
I know, I know, but they're
legit trading patterns.

754
00:45:23,421 --> 00:45:24,787
You know, one bank starts,
they all--

755
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:26,155
yeah, yeah, but...

756
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:27,757
They're all following normal
trends.

757
00:45:27,759 --> 00:45:31,194
Okay, so why isn't
Goldman sachs there?

758
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:35,998
Huh? Why isn't Goldman sachs
doing anything? Why?

759
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,102
The banks were all bailed
out by the fed...

760
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:41,804
In '08 after the crash.

761
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:47,376
But Goldman paid it back
April 14th, '09.

762
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:49,412
Okay?

763
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:53,883
The only company shorting on the
day of the cyber-attack...

764
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:56,385
Are the companies that
the fed bailed out...

765
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:59,756
And has total control over their
managing interests.

766
00:45:59,758 --> 00:46:01,157
George, are you sure about this?

767
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:04,761
The fed doesn't have controlling
interest...

768
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:06,896
In Goldman sachs and it never
did.

769
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,899
Holy shit.
I swear to god.

770
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:11,934
The federal reserve is
orchestrating the largest...

771
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:15,404
Insider trade of all time.

772
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:20,543
<i> Del banco the</i>
<i> banks work for the people...</i>

773
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:23,846
<i> And I am here to insure</i>
<i> the people...</i>

774
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:26,048
<i> To continue their belief</i>
<i> in the banks.</i>

775
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,984
<i> I accept the president's</i>
<i> nomination.</i>

776
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:29,519
<i> I accept the post...</i>

777
00:46:29,521 --> 00:46:32,221
<i> As 16th chairman</i>
<i> of the federal reserve.</i>

778
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:36,425
Oh, I love it here, boys.

779
00:46:36,427 --> 00:46:40,797
Money, power and the circus.

780
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,201
Always wanted to be the
ringleader.

781
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:49,071
And here I am... whoo!

782
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:51,040
Mr. del banco.
Yes.

783
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:53,976
We've spoken amongst
ourselves and...

784
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,545
We can't loan the people
any more money...

785
00:46:55,547 --> 00:46:58,514
Without some incentives.

786
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:02,885
The bank needs incentive
to do their jobs?

787
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:05,321
In '08, you gave us
$800 billion.

788
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,290
Maybe we start there.

789
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:10,927
I'm gonna stop you right there,
bill. We've been cut off.

790
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:13,896
She ran her campaign
on accountability.

791
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:16,065
So no more blank checks
to the banks.

792
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:17,867
We are the five largest
investment banks...

793
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,368
In the western hemisphere.

794
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:22,505
The federal reserve was created
to serve our interests...

795
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:24,407
Not the current flavor
of the week.

796
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,475
Madame president will be--
to be fair...

797
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:30,012
Goldman sachs doesn't come to
these meetings anymore.

798
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:33,850
So I'm looking at four of the
five largest investment banks.

799
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:36,052
Richard, give us our money.

800
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:38,888
She wants to cut a check
to the people instead.

801
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,591
The people are too stupid
to know how to spend it.

802
00:47:41,593 --> 00:47:43,292
Bill, we're on the same page.

803
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:45,628
I took an oath to protect the
financial system...

804
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,464
And I'm sure as hell not gonna
let the people control things.

805
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,233
Then what are we gonna do?

806
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:53,169
I've got a plan.

807
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:56,372
The fed tipped off the banks
two days before...

808
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:59,909
Even the FBI knew
about the threats.

809
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:06,048
They're the ones behind
the attack, man.

810
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,218
We lead the people to a point
of complete panic.

811
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:12,255
Then we rein it all back in.

812
00:48:12,257 --> 00:48:14,624
This is where the markets will
be Monday morning...

813
00:48:14,626 --> 00:48:16,959
Opening bell before the attack.

814
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:22,098
These are the markets at the end
of that day.

815
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,933
Your banks will sell your
assets...

816
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:27,536
A couple of days before the
attack, at the peak up here...

817
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:33,976
Then buy them back down here
for a fraction of the amount.

818
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,580
Next day, the market rebounds...

819
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:41,684
And all those stocks that you
bought for nothing are worth...

820
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:46,656
Well, billions.

821
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:49,458
We've never had a fed chairman
like you.

822
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,427
No, you haven't.

823
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,429
But this is all possible?

824
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:57,099
With the right man on the
inside, anything's possible.

825
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,506
We're being sabotaged, schwab.
We need to meet... now.

826
00:49:03,508 --> 00:49:04,607
<i> Schwab what are</i>
<i> you talking about, guy?</i>

827
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:06,342
<i> I'm in D.C.</i>

828
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:09,178
Yeah? Well, find a plane,
it's a 2-hour flight.

829
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:17,586
This is about so much more
than just money.

830
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,528
Now, we won't be able to catch
him in the act...

831
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,396
Without your help.

832
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:31,200
He will lie to you and tell you
it's all for some greater good.

833
00:49:37,074 --> 00:49:39,675
<i>Pilot big top on</i>
<i>final approach at 12,000 feet.</i>

834
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,984
He will come to your house.
He will use you.

835
00:49:47,986 --> 00:49:49,452
Use you.

836
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:56,225
To help him hijack the markets.

837
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:12,208
You don't want to be used again.

838
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:16,345
There's a hypothesis at best.

839
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,381
So what if Goldman isn't
shorting.

840
00:50:18,383 --> 00:50:20,416
All that proves is they're
still the smartest.

841
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:22,084
Market cap is 18 trillion.

842
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:24,053
The banks are short 8 fucking
trillion.

843
00:50:24,055 --> 00:50:26,555
Goldman hasn't made a move,
okay?

844
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:28,457
Help me out here.

845
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:32,128
Help you out. Christ.
We think--

846
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,696
this isn't exactly
the optimal time...

847
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,331
To play conspiracy theory,
by the way.

848
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:37,299
This isn't a theory.
This is a fact.

849
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:39,068
It's a fact?
Yeah!

850
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,736
This is them rewriting the
rules. Same as it ever was.

851
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:43,439
The housing collapse, student
loans, the great depression...

852
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:45,141
Iraq.

853
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:47,576
You and I both know the fed
is behind everything.

854
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:50,613
Ben, do the right thing.

855
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,054
You can't seriously be
thinking...

856
00:50:58,056 --> 00:50:59,588
About keeping these markets
live tomorrow.

857
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,792
You gotta sort this out.
You gotta freeze everything.

858
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,129
Who else knows about this?

859
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,132
Nobody.

860
00:51:10,134 --> 00:51:13,069
They're the most dangerous.
The most powerful.

861
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,704
Guy, who else knows about this?

862
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,706
No one.

864

You want to stay a free man?

865
00:51:27,819 --> 00:51:30,686
All we talked about here
is baseball.

866
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:36,826

for a minute?

878

Yeah. Is everything okay?

879
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:20,569

Something-- there's something
i need--

882
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:30,713
when we started dating,
you told me how...

883
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:34,250
Complicated things might become.

884
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:36,519
I only came back to do this
because of you.

885
00:52:36,521 --> 00:52:39,522
But I don't know if those were
the right reasons.

886
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:41,790
What?

887

What are you doing?
It's 4:00 A.M.

888
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:18,294
I never wanted to be a cheater.

889
00:53:18,296 --> 00:53:20,496
I know.

890
00:53:20,498 --> 00:53:23,632
Just never enough. I wanted
more, I needed more and more.

891
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:26,235
You know how I would always
say...

892
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:31,874
I'm doing this for you and for
creason to make you happy...

893
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:35,844
Make you comfortable?

894
00:53:35,846 --> 00:53:37,947
I couldn't stop, Shannon,
i couldn't stop.

895
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:45,487

know what's gonna happen.

happen tomorrow.

899

Oh, would you knock it off!

900
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,267
No one knows what's gonna
happen tomorrow.

901
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:00,402
I don't know what's gonna
happen tomorrow.

902

You made a mistake, you fix it.

903

It's what you're gonna do
tomorrow. You're gonna fix it.

904
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:07,910
This is different.
Oh.

905
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,345
This is different.
It's not different!

906
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:10,980
It's not different!
It's not!

907

You always say it's different.
It's not different.

908
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,649
It's the same thing.

909
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:15,017
When you started your business.

910
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:16,518
When you hijacked the market.

911
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,954
When you got caught.

912
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:22,424

still here!

Yeah.

915
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,870
Mom threw a book at me.

916
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:38,440
Yeah, just a paperback.
I'm sorry.

917
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,709
It's okay.

918
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,381
Okay.

919
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:49,018
You okay?

920
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:52,421
He broke up with me.

921
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:56,525
Nah.
You know-- okay?

922
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,430
He broke up with me.

923
00:55:01,432 --> 00:55:02,931
Okay, okay, okay.
Daddy-- no, no.

924
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:06,068
Okay, okay. It's okay, baby.
Oh, sweetie pie.

925
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:13,842
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Fucking Ben.

926
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:16,512
He's such an asshole!
The guy's a...

927
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:20,349
Yes, he's a-- he's an asshole.

928

It's just a boy, sweetie pie.
It's just a boy.

929
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:24,086
It's okay.

930
00:55:24,088 --> 00:55:25,754
But I loved him.

931
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:30,693
No, no, you love me.
You love your daddy.

932
00:55:30,695 --> 00:55:34,063
Okay.
Honey bunny.

933
00:55:34,065 --> 00:55:36,865
Yes.
He's a moron.

934
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:39,601
Lots of boys.

935
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:18,440
They're afraid, George.

936
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:21,510
They're afraid of what might
happen if they lose the system.

937
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:27,816
So what are we gonna do?

938
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:31,820
We're gonna get through this.

939
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:33,622
Are we?

940
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,402
You boys ready to save
the fucking world?

941
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:48,737
We can only hope.

942
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:57,513
It's an angry day.
I like it.

943

Across the riverbed,
into the large hedge...

954
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:30,913
Where he found a most
mysterious object.

955
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:34,149
Now this object wasn't anything
the fox could describe...

956
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:36,518
With his little fox voice.

She said the system is fucked.
She sounded frightened.

965
00:58:00,945 --> 00:58:03,545
Then she just hung up.

966
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:09,518
Well, I told you she
wasn't cut out for this.

967

- Shut it!
- It's too late.

you? Believe any of this?

You did--

haven't you ever wanted
to make an impact?

01:10:01,932 --> 01:10:03,965
she's-- whoa!
What are you doing?!

1201
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:08,303
What are you doing?!
Oh, my god!

1202
01:10:08,305 --> 01:10:12,874
No one really saw this coming.

1203
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:15,577
Wait a second. I'm
tracking this crash just fine.

1204
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:18,479
Leading the people into panic.

1205
01:10:18,481 --> 01:10:20,682
What I'm not tracking, in order
to get these short sales...

1206
01:10:20,684 --> 01:10:23,451
To work, we've got to get the
market back up and functioning.

1207
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:26,321
Right. We pull them
back up online.

1208
01:10:26,323 --> 01:10:28,656
How do you get the markets
back up online?

1209
01:10:28,658 --> 01:10:33,261
Oh, I don't... guy Clifton does.

1210
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:42,470
I just-- I need to know
if it's possible for us...

1211
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:44,906
To override this thing and bring
the markets back on-line.

1212
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:46,741
We slow it all down.

1213
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:50,678
Yeah, it's possible...
But what next?

1214
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,548
That's the million dollar
question.

1215
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:54,582
<i>Sinclair</i>
<i>I don't know why they'd warn...</i>

1216
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:56,384
<i> The rich stock brokers...</i>

1217
01:10:56,386 --> 01:10:57,785
<i> But they said that they've</i>
<i> already hacked...</i>

1218
01:10:57,787 --> 01:10:59,487
<i> The New York stock exchange</i>
<i> backup.</i>

1219
01:10:59,489 --> 01:11:02,490
The government
will call guy Clifton.

1220
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:06,294
And the only reason they know
about guy Clifton's skill set...

1221
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:11,599
Is because... I conveniently
recommended his indictment.

1222
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:17,605
I want you to get me a list
of all our positions...

1223
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:20,608
Long and short, everything
in the portfolio.

1224
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,911
He'll play the markets
just like us.

1225
01:11:23,913 --> 01:11:25,980
Come on, help me fix this.

1226
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:27,682
What's in it for me?

1227
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:30,752
But he's also facing jail time,
thanks to yours truly.

1228
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:32,020
I'm gonna need immunity.

1229
01:11:32,022 --> 01:11:33,755
So they'll offer him immunity...

1230
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:36,491
To stop an inevitable terror
attack.

1231
01:11:36,493 --> 01:11:39,460
It's risky... but they won't
have any choice.

1232
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,296
We'll make sure of that.

1233
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:43,898
These cyber threats have no
lasting implications...

1234
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:46,334
On any market ever.

1235
01:11:46,336 --> 01:11:47,835
Ben, do the right thing.

1236
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:53,441
The virus I give Ben
isn't unbreakable.

1237
01:11:53,443 --> 01:11:55,443
It'll take some
hours, but they'll crack it.

1238
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,680
No matter what happens...

1239
01:11:58,682 --> 01:12:01,382
Even if Clifton figures the
whole thing out...

1240
01:12:01,384 --> 01:12:04,052
He'll still pull the markets
back up online...

1241
01:12:04,054 --> 01:12:06,788
Because if he doesn't...

1242
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:11,059
He'll lose all his money,
just like us.

1243
01:12:11,061 --> 01:12:14,696
So you're betting our banks
on one man's greed?

1244
01:12:14,698 --> 01:12:17,398
Absolutely.

1245
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,367
<i> Man the cabinet</i>
<i> and the federal reserve...</i>

1246
01:12:19,369 --> 01:12:21,502
<i>Are meeting behind closed doors</i>
<i>at the moment...</i>

1247
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:24,005
<i> Discussing next steps while</i>
<i> they desperately...</i>

1248
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:26,374
<i>Try to keep the economy alive.</i>

1249
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:28,376
<i> They know how much money</i>
<i> they need...</i>

1250
01:12:28,378 --> 01:12:31,346
<i> But they don't know how</i>
<i> they're going to get it.</i>

1251
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:34,782
Crazy virus del banco gave you.

1252
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:38,086
I didn't know I was
planting a virus.

1253
01:12:38,088 --> 01:12:40,455
This isn't your fault, son.

1254
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,626
You were trying to do
the right thing.

1255
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:51,632
I didn't let you trust me
enough, Ben.

1256
01:12:56,004 --> 01:12:58,840
I hear you broke up
with creason.

1257
01:12:58,842 --> 01:13:02,744
I was under the impression you
were trying to hijack--

1258
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:06,948
do you have any idea what that
does to a girl like her?

1259
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,386
She doesn't give a shit
about any of this, Ben.

1260
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:13,087
You know that.

1261
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:16,457
Any way to make this right?

1262
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:21,896
This was gonna happen sooner
or later, not this soon.

1263
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,065
Not this soon.

1264
01:13:24,067 --> 01:13:26,434
I didn't want creason
to have to choose sides...

1265
01:13:26,436 --> 01:13:29,170
After all this went down.

1266
01:13:29,172 --> 01:13:31,806
You'll always be her father.

1267
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,085
Backend server code confirmed.

1268
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:47,155
<i> We have a double-enter enable</i>
<i> key on my mark.</i>

1269
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:53,795
<i> 3... 2, 1.</i>

1270
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:18,886
I need your word, interest rates
must remain low...

1271
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:22,023
Loans approved, money flowing...

1272
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:26,661
Because we are doing this
for the good of the people...

1273
01:14:26,663 --> 01:14:28,996
Because it's the right thing
to do.

1274
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:34,469
Hello?

1275
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:42,977
<i> Schwab</i>
<i> guy.</i>

1276
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:51,986
Hey! Free money!
Get the fuck out of here!

1277
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,754
<i> Schwab</i>
<i> hello?</i>

1278
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:08,102
<i> Hello?</i>
<i> You know, schwab...</i>

1279
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:09,804
You're not gonna convince me...

1280
01:15:09,806 --> 01:15:12,039
That the system's just gonna
fix itself again.

1281
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:15,810
<i> Guy</i>
<i> the banks and the fed...</i>

1282
01:15:15,812 --> 01:15:18,212
<i>Where did that money come from,</i>
<i>schwab?</i>

1283
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:21,249
<i> Hm? Whose money is that?</i>

1284
01:15:21,251 --> 01:15:24,151
<i>We the people shouldn't be made</i>
<i>up of you or me...</i>

1285
01:15:24,153 --> 01:15:25,920
<i> Or the bankers that fucking</i>
<i> control us!</i>

1286
01:15:25,922 --> 01:15:27,722
<i> And don't tell me that</i>
<i> I'm wrong.</i>

1287
01:15:27,724 --> 01:15:30,625
<i> Because up until today,</i>
<i> I was one of those guys.</i>

1288
01:15:30,627 --> 01:15:34,028
<i> Taking people's money and</i>
<i> manipulating the system.</i>

1289
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,196
<i> I've owned that.</i>

1290
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,034
I've owned it.

1291
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:47,074
The system... does not work.

1292
01:15:47,076 --> 01:15:49,810
<i> Your money is not safe</i>
<i> in the banks.</i>

1293
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:52,213
<i> Don't keep more than</i>
<i> what you need.</i>

1294
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:54,282
<i> If the banks get in trouble,</i>
<i> they will take your money.</i>

1295
01:15:54,284 --> 01:15:56,150
<i> The government will take</i>
<i> your money.</i>

1296
01:15:56,152 --> 01:15:59,186
<i>We made realistic rules so that</i>
<i>it could never happen again.</i>

1297
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:02,123
<i> We do not have jurisdiction</i>
<i> to directly go out...</i>

1298
01:16:02,125 --> 01:16:05,593
<i> And audit reserve bank</i>
<i> activities.</i>

1299
01:16:05,595 --> 01:16:07,662
Mr. del banco.
Yeah.

1300
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:09,697
Can I ask you a question?

1301
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:12,800
Why do you meet here?

1302
01:16:12,802 --> 01:16:16,337
Why are we at the circus?

1303
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:20,975
This is where the stock market
was created.

1304
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,211
Come here.

1305
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:29,250
Now there are several theories,
of course...

1306
01:16:29,252 --> 01:16:31,886
But this is the one
i subscribe to.

1307
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:35,723
It was a hot summer day
in 1792...

1308
01:16:35,725 --> 01:16:41,262
And four men sitting right
over there, created--

1309
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:43,898
they created a market place...

1310
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,233
Whereby people like you and I...

1311
01:16:46,235 --> 01:16:49,637
Could bet on a working-class
America...

1312
01:16:49,639 --> 01:16:53,040
Through stocks and bonds.

1313
01:16:53,042 --> 01:16:56,010
It was the greatest game
ever invented.

1314
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:57,778
That's what they called it.

1315
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:01,248
And there were two clowns,
performing an operatic...

1316
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:04,318
While they were being chased
by a bear.

1317
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,754
Right there.

1318
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:10,291
And it was the clowns
that gave them the idea.

1319
01:17:10,293 --> 01:17:13,260
But the clowns had to outrun
the bear.

1320
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:17,098
Well, he didn't have to outrun
the bear...

1321
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,367
He just had to outrun
the other guy.

1322
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:25,239
Cheers to the American dream.

1323
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:33,214
<i>Guy you have got to tell</i>
<i>the people the truth, schwab.</i>

1324
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,419
<i> You got to tell the truth.</i>

1325
01:17:41,156 --> 01:17:43,891
<i>You got to do the right thing.</i>

1326
01:17:43,893 --> 01:17:46,127
<i> Letting the banks get away</i>
<i> with this...</i>

1327
01:17:46,129 --> 01:17:49,830
<i>It's just not the right thing.</i>

1328
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,999
<i> You know why?</i>

1329
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:55,403
<i> Because our kids still need</i>
<i> to live in this world.</i>

1330
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:03,177
<i> Do you understand?</i>
<i> It's up to you.</i>

1331
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:09,450
I really wish I could help
you with this. I do.

1332
01:18:09,452 --> 01:18:13,788
And I wish I could help you
save the world...

1333
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,776
But I'm late for dinner.
