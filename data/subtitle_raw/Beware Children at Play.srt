1
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,324
Grendel the cannibal wants
to eat your old blood!

2
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,272
No!

3
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,673
No!

4
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:22,843
Grendel's going to swallow you.

5
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,246
Well, the tickle monster's
going to tickle you.

6
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:25,913
No, no, no.

7
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:26,647
Stop.

8
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:33,787
I'm hungry.

9
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,727
We'll catch us some fish then.

10
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,461
Get up.

11
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:56,444
--donkey-donk
there, here a donkey,

12
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,911
there a donkey, everywhere
a donkey, donkey.

13
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:06,787
Old MacDonald had
a farm, E-I-E-I-O.

14
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,456
Whew.

15
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,697
Woods are a-bloom.

16
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,700
The wide world awakens.

17
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,536
Happy the mansions,
the meadows most fair.

18
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,612
And where are ye
going, Glenn Randall, my son?

19
00:03:31,645 --> 00:03:35,583
Where are ye going,
my handsome young man?

20
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:39,553
I've been to the
woods with father.

21
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:43,023
I've been to the
woods with father.

22
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:48,796
But make my bed soon, for I'm
sick at the heart and fain

23
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,997
would lie down.

24
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,504
What do they mean, Daddy?

25
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:59,440
The words.

26
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,876
The words are magic words.

27
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,879
They're beautiful words, Glenn.

28
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,782
They're like fossils in a rock.

29
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,718
They preserve the
hopes and dreams

30
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,020
of those who came before us.

31
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,788
We say their words
and sing their songs

32
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:17,458
so we don't forget them.

33
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:17,991
You understand?

34
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,996
Ah, you will someday
soon, I promise.

35
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:30,338
You want some more fish?

36
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,505
Soup?

37
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:33,474
No.

38
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:34,608
Marshmallow?

39
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:35,576
Yeah.

40
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,979
Yeah..

41
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,614
OK.

42
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:41,615
Where's your stick?

43
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,483
Put it on there.

44
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,489
So what do you think, tomorrow
night we cook fish again,

45
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:49,390
or we go to McDonald's?

46
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:50,524
We go to McDonald's.

47
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:51,425
I agree.

48
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,010
Where have you
gone, Glenn Randall?

49
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:27,027
Oh, now you've angered
the grim demon.

50
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,663
You've made him angry
and eager to kill.

51
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:48,716
Daddy, what happened?

52
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:55,889
Help me, Glenn.

53
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,043
Come here, son.

54
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,411
Everything's going
to be all right.

55
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,780
Come here.

56
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:20,581
Don't be afraid.

57
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:21,114
Don't be.

58
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,524
Everything going to be all
right if we just keep our heads.

59
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:33,527
Somebody will come
looking for us soon.

60
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,730
But you must do exactly as
I say-- exactly as I say.

61
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:37,465
Do you understand?

62
00:06:42,035 --> 00:06:43,837
There's food and provisions
back at the campsite.

63
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:47,641
Do you remember
how to get there?

64
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:48,576
OK, go.

65
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:49,870
Three days.

66
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,740
Where are they?

67
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:53,674
Why don't they come?

68
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:20,834
Wild land, lonely land,
land of wolf places.

69
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,201
They're going to kill us.

70
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,870
They're leaving
us to die, Glenn.

71
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:57,204
Murderers!

72
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:12,720
God punishes the sin of
murder, banishes monsters

73
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:15,823
and trolls and goblins
from the fields of men.

74
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:46,319
Maggots eat my body,
sin eats my soul.

75
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:58,265
In the darkness, a
demon-- a demon grim.

76
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:07,074
Cursed, cast out, a
damned exile, angry.

77
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:09,677
Angry and eager to kill.

78
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,210
Daddy?

79
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,316
Glenn?

80
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,653
Oh, Glenn.

81
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:22,222
Do as I say.

82
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,992
You must do as I say.

83
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:25,726
Yes, Daddy.

84
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:33,100
A grim demon, cursed, cast out.

85
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,773
A savage demon.

86
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:48,015
No hope to halt the savage
assault. Tear it to pieces.

87
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:50,283
Bite through the bones.

88
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,251
Gulp the blood.

89
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,652
Gobble the flesh.

90
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:09,369
God protect us from
goblins and ghosties

91
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,239
and long-legged
beasties, and things

92
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,707
that go bump in the night.

93
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:39,199
Tear it to pieces.

94
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,901
Bite through the bones.

95
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:41,902
Gulp the blood.

96
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:42,435
Gobble the flesh.

97
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:04,191
Are we there yet?

98
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,759
Not yet, sweetheart.

99
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:07,227
She started asking
that question when

100
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,228
we were still in the driveway.

101
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,297
I have to go potty, Mommy.

102
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,032
We'll be there soon, Cara.

103
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,500
It's number two.

104
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,368
Anybody with kids
ought to have a Portosan

105
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,470
built into the backseat.

106
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,306
Don't take your bad mood
out on the baby, John.

107
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:20,107
It's not her fault.

108
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,541
I know.

109
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,077
You forgive grumpy
old daddy-bear, honey?

110
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:26,113
Will you buy me a Barbie doll?

111
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,280
Barbie is not a doll.

112
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,849
Barbie is an addiction.

113
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,851
Do you know what
Barbie leads to?

114
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,353
Barbie hats, Barbie
dresses, Barbie houses.

115
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,522
Who knows, Barbie Kotex.

116
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,390
Once Barbie gets
you, you're gone.

117
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,226
She can't help wanting things.

118
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,161
She takes after her father.

119
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,529
Come on, Julie.

120
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,264
I'm just trying to
make an honest living.

121
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,065
Honest?

122
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,533
That's a laugh.

123
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,902
The column you used to
write for "The Times

124
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:52,873
Book Review," that was honest.

125
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,374
How could a man who had
the sensitivity and insight

126
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:58,178
to write beautifully about
new novels and modern poetry

127
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:01,581
write that trash
for trivial minds?

128
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,217
Books, mostly
paperbacks, with lurid

129
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:08,488
covers about flying saucers
and ghosts and witches?

130
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,357
John, how could you?

131
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,360
Listen, my books are
honest, and they seek

132
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:15,562
answers to honest questions.

133
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,098
Then why do they
need those covers?

134
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,035
Girls with cleavages,
front and back,

135
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,939
being pursued by all
manner of ghastly creature?

136
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:28,408
Garish colors and
cheap graphics.

137
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,910
I don't paint
the covers, Julie.

138
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:32,612
The publishers think
they help sell the books.

139
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,515
How oft the apparel
doth proclaim the man.

140
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,851
How oft the cover
proclaims the book.

141
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:39,853
You're a snob, Julie.

142
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,855
Lots of good writers
have their books packaged

143
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,590
in ways they don't
necessarily like,

144
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,959
but they still pick
up the royalty checks.

145
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:46,559
Money.

146
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:47,560
Always money.

147
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,629
You don't seem to mind
the creature comforts

148
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,065
that money provides
or the security

149
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:55,302
we can give Cara because of it.

150
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,637
The college simply
doesn't pay enough.

151
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,006
I like teaching English.

152
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,140
I like eating.

153
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,944
I like to go potty.

154
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:04,878
OK, honey.

155
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:07,380
We'll be at Uncle
Ross's any minute now.

156
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:08,581
Can I play with Mary Rose?

157
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,516
Sure can.

158
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:11,618
And Amy too?

159
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,120
Amy's gone away
for a while, honey.

160
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,387
Oh, John.

161
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,023
Poor Ross and Cleo.

162
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,958
Have they gotten over it yet?

163
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,928
It's not an easy
thing to forget.

164
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,063
Are you sure we should
be visiting them?

165
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,364
It's been three years now.

166
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,900
Ross thinks we can
help Cleo, kind

167
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29,102
of coax her back into society.

168
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:33,540
She's been very withdrawn
since the incident.

169
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:35,642
Well, it looks like he
could use some help.

170
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:39,079
Are we there yet?

171
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:42,015
You don't need to stop for a
stranger with Cara in the car.

172
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:43,083
John!

173
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,391
Kid!

174
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:57,097
Kid!

175
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,531
Mommy, it hurts.

176
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,566
Stay in the car, sweetheart.

177
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,367
Don't get out.

178
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,668
Just stay in the car.

179
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:03,170
Mighty good of you, neighbor.

180
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:04,972
Mighty good.

181
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,108
You know, you don't see too many
good Samaritans around anymore,

182
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,577
not even here below the
buckle of the New Jersey

183
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,180
Bible Belt. Didn't
mean to frighten

184
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:14,948
your little one like that.

185
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,184
Ordinarily I'm very
good with children.

186
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:19,319
Always had a little space
in my heart for the tykes,

187
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,121
as you might say.

188
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,489
Well, then watch your own son
and keep him out of the road.

189
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:23,556
He might
have been killed.

190
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,657
Well, hold on, hold on.

191
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:27,660
Don't get your
bowels in an uproar.

192
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,130
Besides, it wasn't
any kid of mine

193
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:33,666
you seen running out there--
leastwise not that I know of.

194
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,268
You know, I'm a
salesman, you know.

195
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,337
I'm on the road all the time.

196
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,074
Franklin Ludwig's the
name, salvation's the game.

197
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,542
Say, you wouldn't happen
to have some spare water

198
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,677
for the radiator, would you?

199
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,214
I'm afraid I can't help
you there, Mr. Ludwig.

200
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,750
God damn it, then it'll
have to cool off by itself.

201
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,485
What a hunk of tin.

202
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,487
If there was a
hell for cars, it'd

203
00:15:54,521 --> 00:15:57,490
be right comfortable there.

204
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:59,259
What are you selling
there, Mr. Ludwig?

205
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,128
Goddamn best little
book you ever saw.

206
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:09,769
Beebs Bibles-- the
word made cheap.

207
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,638
That's what they want out
here in the boondoggles,

208
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:14,174
cut-rate salvation.

209
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:17,744
Hell, these farmers can't
afford to patch up their asses.

210
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:21,348
But you mention the good news,
and they'll always manage

211
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,515
to cough up a couple of bucks.

212
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:25,318
The price is right.

213
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:26,119
How about it?

214
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,087
Sorry.

215
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,389
We're not really religious.

216
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:32,292
Well, I knew that soon
as you got out of the car.

217
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,162
Oh, by the way, if I was you, I
wouldn't go around volunteering

218
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,030
that information around here.

219
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:40,233
You know, New England wasn't
the only place where they burned

220
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,103
witches and other folks
whose viewpoints differed

221
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,537
from that of the local files.

222
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,673
Is that so?

223
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:49,642
Oh, hell yeah.

224
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,379
This place was teeming
with federal marshals

225
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,148
right after World
War I. Seems as

226
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,817
though a couple of the
locals took it into the minds

227
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,222
that some of the city slickers
were possessed by demons,

228
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:06,159
and they exorcised them
the best way they knew how.

229
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:08,261
What was that?

230
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:11,698
Put goddamn bullets through
their wiped out all families--

231
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,135
kids, dogs, cats, goldfish.

232
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,637
As the good book says,
they left not one to piss

233
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,240
against the wall.

234
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,509
Left not one to piss
against the wall?

235
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,411
The Bible says that?

236
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:26,413
Book of Kings, John.

237
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,181
You're right, ma'am.

238
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,217
Hey, I thought you said
you wasn't religious.

239
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,218
I'm not.

240
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,420
I teach English literature.

241
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:36,656
That includes the King James
translation of the Bible.

242
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,791
Your quotation
from King's refers

243
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,860
to the instruction
given to Hebrew warriors

244
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,296
before they attacked the enemy.

245
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,731
Right again, ma'am.

246
00:17:44,764 --> 00:17:45,865
Here they take
that kind of stuff

247
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,669
literal like, standard operating
procedures for fighting

248
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:52,105
the enemies of Jehovah.

249
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:54,374
What was the name of the group?

250
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,276
Are any of them still around?

251
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,412
If you want to believe it,
their names were Brownies.

252
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:02,315
Not the little girls with
beanies on their heads.

253
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:05,818
Nah, this group was more
like the Ku Klux Klan,

254
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:09,422
except maybe not quite
so friendly or tolerant.

255
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:12,325
Their leader was a man
named Preacher Brown.

256
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,394
He and his family disappeared
when the marshals came

257
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,263
in to clean out their flock.

258
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,898
Nobody's heard or seen
of him since then.

259
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,500
Most of the people
around these parts

260
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,802
are descendants
of those brownies.

261
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,438
Personally I think
they've gone underground.

262
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:26,606
What makes you say that?

263
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,542
You'll see.

264
00:18:29,576 --> 00:18:31,744
You're in the pine
barrens of New Jersey.

265
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:34,814
These people are mean
and suspicious folks.

266
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,717
Anybody beyond a second
or a third grade education

267
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,188
is called Doctor around here.

268
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:44,457
And then of course there are
the missing people, mostly kids.

269
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:49,396
Well, we know Sheriff Carr, and
we know about his daughter Amy.

270
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,463
Have there been others?

271
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:55,602
Oh, hell yeah, maybe 12
kids, four or five adults

272
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,238
over the last couple of years.

273
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,206
You close to the sheriff?

274
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,807
He kin?
-No.

275
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,309
Ross and I were in
the Marines together.

276
00:19:02,342 --> 00:19:04,277
We keep in touch.

277
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:06,846
Your buddy's in a heap
of trouble, Mister.

278
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,282
I'll tell you, if his
daughter hadn't disappeared

279
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:11,184
too a couple of years
ago, they probably

280
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,420
would have strong him up.

281
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,654
They don't trust him, you know.

282
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,424
He was raised in the big city.

283
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,526
What the hell do you think
I talk like this for?

284
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,529
I'm an NYU graduate.

285
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:25,432
Thanks for the information,
Mr. Ludwig, and the advice.

286
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,967
Good luck with your sales.

287
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,068
Luck?

288
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:33,406
You don't need any god damn
luck with these yokels.

289
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,677
You just say it's the word
of God and open sesame.

290
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,280
Their flyblown pocketbooks
spread their cheek,

291
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:44,651
and the long green pops
out like pus from a pimple.

292
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,419
You're sure you're not
interested in one of these?

293
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:47,787
Makes for good protective power.

294
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,927
Those god damned heathens.

295
00:20:13,313 --> 00:20:15,282
God damn it, I'm
beginning to spook myself.

296
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,528
Ross, you son of a bitch.

297
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,695
You haven't changed much.

298
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:03,630
It's good to see you.

299
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,932
Thanks for coming.

300
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:06,866
Julie, honey!

301
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,901
You're looking smart
and pretty as ever.

302
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:09,936
Hi, Ross.

303
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:12,672
And hello to you,
Princess Cara.

304
00:21:12,705 --> 00:21:14,040
Did you come to play
with Mary Rose, huh?

305
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:14,741
Uh-huh.

306
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,644
And Amy too when she comes home.

307
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,912
Oh, Ross, I'm sorry.

308
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,682
Are you sure Cleo is really
up to having house guests?

309
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,451
Yeah, Dr. Fish was
just checking her out.

310
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,019
She-- she'll be fine.

311
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:28,821
Oh, Julie, honey, I'm sorry.

312
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,857
This is county medical
examiner, Dr. Robert T. Fish.

313
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:31,924
-Nice to meet you.
-John.

314
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,526
Nice to meet you.
-Dr. Fish.

315
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,794
Pleasure to meet
you, Mr. DeWolfe.

316
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,729
I'm a great fan of yours.

317
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,698
Although I have to
admit, I'm forced to rip

318
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:40,367
the covers off your paperbacks.

319
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,601
All those cleavages, you know.

320
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,770
Mrs. Fish doesn't approve.

321
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,338
Do tell.

322
00:21:45,372 --> 00:21:47,674
Yes, I was very interested
in your last book--

323
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:50,677
the one about the couple
who claimed they were

324
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,111
kidnapped by a flying saucer.

325
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,414
"Unexpected Detour"?

326
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:56,683
They didn't claim they
were abducted, Doctor.

327
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,985
That information was revealed
under hypnotic regression

328
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:01,454
by a fully certified
psychiatrist.

329
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:05,392
I invite my readers to
draw their own conclusions.

330
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:07,527
Yes, but don't you
tend to lead them a bit?

331
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,028
I mean, your books
wouldn't sell nearly

332
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,830
as well as if they were
about some emotionally

333
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:12,499
disturbed couple.

334
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,501
And that picture
I had to rip off,

335
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:18,137
it did feature a rather
abundantly proportioned

336
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,440
young lady who was
having her clothes ripped

337
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:21,974
off by some sort of goblin.

338
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:24,577
And that title,
"Unexpected Detour,"

339
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:25,745
doesn't that infer
that they were

340
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:28,915
actually led off the highway
by some mysterious power?

341
00:22:28,948 --> 00:22:31,551
Maybe they had a daughter
who needed a potty stop.

342
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,019
Speaking of which, we'd
better get the munchkin

343
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,987
here to the nearest facility.

344
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,022
With sirens and red lights.

345
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:36,756
This way, folks.

346
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:44,864
God damn piece of shit.

347
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,900
I don't get any water soon,
I'll never get home before 9:00.

348
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:48,635
Hey, Braun.

349
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,605
Braun!

350
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:02,148
Braun, wait a minute, will ya?

351
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:02,882
Braun!

352
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,882
Braun!

353
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,218
Come on, Braun.

354
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,454
How about a little
water for my car,

355
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:43,556
just a little water for
a poor parishioner who's

356
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,757
trying to spread
the world of God?

357
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:38,878
If you gentlemen would
just serve yourselves,

358
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,780
Julie and I will get the
children ready for bed.

359
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:52,191
Thanks.

360
00:24:55,962 --> 00:25:00,166
Ross, what's going on?

361
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:04,236
Amy isn't the only child
who disappeared, John.

362
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,072
In the past three
years, our community

363
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:11,611
has lost 12 children, all
gone without a trace or clue.

364
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:14,547
Amy was the first.

365
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:18,050
We've lost some adults too,
but the kids-- the kids

366
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:22,789
seem to vanish in sequence,
one every two months.

367
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,624
Ludwig mentioned the
disappearing kids,

368
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:27,727
but he didn't say
anything about a pattern.

369
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,996
Ludwig, the salesman?

370
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,564
Where'd you run into him?

371
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:33,199
Out on the highway.

372
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:36,068
His car was having some trouble.

373
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,070
Don't you have any leads at all?

374
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:40,907
None.

375
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,076
It's one of the reasons you're
here, even though I should warn

376
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,311
you that Dr. Fish disapproves.

377
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:54,854
Good night, Mommy.

378
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,227
No fuss, young lady.

379
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,195
You and Mary Rose have
a busy day tomorrow.

380
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,598
I want you to go nighty-nights
as soon as possible.

381
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:08,735
Cross my heart, Mommy.

382
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,335
OK.

383
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,336
Good night, Aunt Julie.

384
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,137
Good night.

385
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,639
Good night, Aunt Cleo.

386
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:13,305
Good night.

387
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:16,909
No more chit-chat.

388
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,149
Good night, Mary Rose.

389
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,083
Good night, Cara.

390
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,259
We've tried everything, John.

391
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:37,296
Followed every lead,
exhausted every possibility.

392
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,998
Police and detective
methods just don't

393
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:40,867
seem to work in this case.

394
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,302
That's where you come in.

395
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:49,108
In one of your books--
damn, this is tough for me.

396
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:52,011
In one of your books, you
talked about a medium,

397
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:55,347
mind reader, something, who
helped police cracked cases.

398
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:56,883
I gotta know, is she for real?

399
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,952
Or did you pad your stories
to make it seem real?

400
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,854
Mind readers?

401
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:03,422
What are you talking
about, Ross Carr?

402
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,224
Your daughter is missing.

403
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:08,127
Why aren't you out
there looking for her?

404
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,395
What kind of a father
are you anyway?

405
00:27:22,008 --> 00:27:23,242
Here's Freddie.

406
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,147
You scared me!

407
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,049
This is my friend, Freddie.

408
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,118
He's one of my dollies.

409
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,921
My daddy's gonna
buy me a Barbie.

410
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:37,924
Mommy says I'm not old
enough for a Barbie.

411
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:40,226
I wanted to play with Amy's,
but Mommy won't let me.

412
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,934
It's the woodies.

413
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,068
What?

414
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:50,269
The woodies,
things in the woods.

415
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:51,070
You know.

416
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:53,005
No such things.

417
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:53,840
Who says?

418
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:54,841
Mommy.

419
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:56,275
So does my mommy.

420
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:57,977
Mommies don't know much.

421
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,111
There are two woodies.

422
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:00,312
Are not.

423
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,380
Are too.

424
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,949
Are not.

425
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,722
I know, because Amy's a woodie.

426
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,327
Damn it, I shouldn't have
said anything in front of her.

427
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,229
It's bad enough as it is.

428
00:28:17,263 --> 00:28:18,998
I gave her a shot.

429
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,200
She'll rest some now.

430
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:24,236
Actually, I have read all
of your books, Mr. DeWolfe,

431
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,305
especially since Ross mentioned
that he was considering

432
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:28,474
asking you down here.

433
00:28:28,507 --> 00:28:30,176
I must admit, I find
your subject matter

434
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:33,312
provocative and intriguing.

435
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:37,216
But the problems in this case
are no longer academic for me.

436
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:41,087
My interests are more
than a mere guessing game.

437
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,923
That's why my questions
must be blunt.

438
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,958
Shoot.

439
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:48,761
How well did you
do your research?

440
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:51,831
And do you honestly
believe in what you write?

441
00:28:51,864 --> 00:28:55,768
And is this mind
reader thing genuine?

442
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:57,770
You see, I have to be
convinced that there

443
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:00,206
are other possibilities
such as people being

444
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,242
kidnapped by flying saucers.

445
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,812
Sheriff Carr is my friend.

446
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:08,514
I know-- I know he's
a friend of yours.

447
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,283
That's why I must
know the truth.

448
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:14,120
If your books are phony, I
won't reveal it to the public.

449
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,288
Dr. Fish, I can assure--

450
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,161
I want my daughter
back, damn it.

451
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:25,097
I want her back.

452
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,925
Just received word, Sheriff.

453
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:56,562
Pete Gordon's eight-year-old,
gone like the rest.

454
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,898
Some of the boys
are out there now.

455
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:01,600
Any comment on the latest
disappearance, Sheriff?

456
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,535
I mean, do you
consider the number

457
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:04,971
13 to be unlucky or anything?

458
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,877
Should I just jot
down the usual?

459
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:16,115
No clues, no leads, no
hits, no runs, no errors?

460
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:19,285
Just 13 kids left on base,
except you don't even

461
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,453
know where the ballpark is.

462
00:30:26,492 --> 00:30:30,129
Sheriff I think you and Mr.
DeWolfe better get on inside.

463
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,597
I'll handle this.

464
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,365
Mr. DeWolfe?

465
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:37,636
Not the Mr. DeWolfe, the
sheriff's famous friend?

466
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:42,408
John DeWolfe-- author,
lecturer, and get

467
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:46,378
this, folks, ghost hunter.

468
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:48,647
Isn't that right, Mr. DeWolfe?

469
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,417
You better step
aside, Miss Hawthorne.

470
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,019
We'll keep you and
the rest of the press

471
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,987
informed of our progress, Dale.

472
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,123
So far there hasn't been
a thimbleful of progress

473
00:30:57,156 --> 00:30:58,490
to be informed about.

474
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,225
Excuse me.

475
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:04,096
John DeWolfe.

476
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:04,897
My, my.

477
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,184
Mr. DeWolfe.

478
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,618
Hello, Doctor.

479
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:28,554
Well, it isn't
everybody that gets

480
00:31:28,587 --> 00:31:29,989
a welcoming committee
like that when

481
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:31,390
they come to work every day.

482
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:32,124
Morning, Bob.

483
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,328
Dr. Fish.

484
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:38,197
Luke.

485
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,467
Well, I'm still waiting for
those answers, Mr. DeWolfe.

486
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,002
Call me cynical,
but I don't think

487
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,336
you're going to add
anything of significance

488
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,438
to this investigation.

489
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:48,975
None of your methods have
done anything so far, Doctor.

490
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:51,543
Maybe it's time we started
thinking of this case

491
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:55,447
in different terms,
with new eyes.

492
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:56,248
In any event, it won't hurt.

493
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:57,616
The worst that can
happen is we'll

494
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:01,587
be right back where we are now.

495
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,956
Well, I can't argue
with you there,

496
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,058
except to say just
one thing-- we've got

497
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,027
to set a time limit on this.

498
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,596
Now, if we don't get any
results with your methods,

499
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:14,066
we're going to have to go
back to the sure and safe way.

500
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,402
Agreed.

501
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,304
Good.

502
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:18,637
Where do we start?

503
00:32:29,581 --> 00:32:32,051
Says here's that this Isaac
Braun was interviewed again

504
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:34,486
by detectives two months
after his son's disappearance

505
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,025
and claimed to have seen
the boys subsequently.

506
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,993
The detectives couldn't get
him to explain what he meant,

507
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:42,694
though, so they dropped it.

508
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:43,829
That's because they
know Isaac Braun.

509
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:48,367
He's a crazy backwoods farmer
and a religious fanatic.

510
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,501
A brownie?

511
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:50,769
No.

512
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,638
There's no brownies
around here anymore.

513
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:54,173
Why told you about the brownies?

514
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:57,409
The salesman, Ludwig.

515
00:32:57,443 --> 00:33:00,679
Outsiders are always fascinated
by stories about the brownies.

516
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,182
You sure they're gone?

517
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,551
Ludwig said they had
just gone underground.

518
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,553
Some of these sects
are pretty weird, Ross.

519
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:10,289
This-- this could
be your tie-in.

520
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:12,124
I doubt it, John.

521
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,425
There haven't been
any brownies around

522
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,294
here since before I was born.

523
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,629
Hell, I've lived
here all my life.

524
00:33:17,663 --> 00:33:20,266
I mean, except for
school and Vietnam,

525
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,101
I've been here all that time.

526
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:23,369
You don't think I would
have heard something?

527
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,537
Not necessarily.

528
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:30,676
Consider your position and
these brownies' history.

529
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,478
Well, I wasn't the
sheriff when I was a kid,

530
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,246
and kids hear everything.

531
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,449
Don't forget that one, John.

532
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:38,750
That's a dead end.

533
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:40,252
Our friend Isaac Braun
is just your garden

534
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:42,088
variety religious nut.

535
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:45,691
He probably thought he saw his
son in some kind of a vision.

536
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:46,625
OK.

537
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:50,562
I'll file the brownies
away for a while.

538
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:53,399
Let's go talk to this Mr. Braun
and get us some salvation.

539
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,839
Morning, Mr. Braun.

540
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,773
Morning, Sheriff.

541
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:03,275
This is John DeWolfe.

542
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,177
Mr. DeWolfe.

543
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,679
Mr. Braun, in your last
interview with detectives,

544
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:11,617
you claimed you
saw your son again.

545
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,254
Did you see him or didn't you?

546
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:16,722
I'm through with
fooling with you, Braun.

547
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:19,725
Now, where did you see Jamie?

548
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:20,459
There.

549
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,277
Did you go to him
or did you call him?

550
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,345
No.

551
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:40,779
Why not.

552
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,115
Because that boy
was not my Jamie.

553
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:43,715
What do you mean?

554
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,285
You just said he was.

555
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:48,620
Goblins and giants
who battle with God.

556
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:49,888
Come again?

557
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,824
Goblins and giants
who battle with God.

558
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:54,726
What is that, a line from
the Bible or something?

559
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,862
No, not the good book.

560
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:58,430
Mr. Braun, I don't
know what's going on--

561
00:34:58,464 --> 00:34:59,365
Sheriff, you got a warrant?

562
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:00,232
No, but I don't think that's--

563
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,600
Then get off
my land, or I'll--

564
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:02,468
Or what?

565
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:04,470
Or I'll call the police.

566
00:35:04,503 --> 00:35:07,706
Ross, let's get back.

567
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:08,674
I'll talk to you later, Braun.

568
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:20,519
What was that up there?

569
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:23,422
Ross, does Braun strike
you as the hospitable type?

570
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,358
I mean, the sort who'd invite
in strangers off the road?

571
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:27,559
Are you kidding?

572
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:28,727
You saw the way he acted.

573
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,262
Besides, this whole
area is posted.

574
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,197
Take a look around.

575
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,798
Right, then
we're agreed he isn't

576
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,600
the kind of guy who'd
invite in a traveling

577
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,768
salesman off the road.

578
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,637
Not a chance.

579
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,772
What are you getting at, John?

580
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,374
Ross, when we get
back to town, I

581
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:44,276
think you'd better give
Ludwig's home office a call

582
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,512
and see if he's checked in.

583
00:35:46,545 --> 00:35:49,348
What's the name of that outfit?

584
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:52,384
Beebs Bibles, the
word made cheap.

585
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:53,852
Why?

586
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:56,722
Because I saw Ludwig's
car behind the barn.

587
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,790
There's no mistaking that heap.

588
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,726
I can't believe
Braun would invite

589
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:03,495
Ludwig in for an overnight.

590
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:04,763
Those two would
make the Odd Couple

591
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:07,633
look like identical twins.

592
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,236
He's giving me weird
vibrations, Ross.

593
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,169
Yes, Pete?

594
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:13,472
I thought you just
wrote about that stuff.

595
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,608
Some of the people I've talked
to tell you that everybody has

596
00:36:16,642 --> 00:36:20,446
is, a sort of a sixth sense.

597
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:21,847
Check it out for me, Ross.

598
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,317
It might not be anything,
but I don't know.

599
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:25,851
OK.

600
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,224
What did the sheriff want, Pa?

601
00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:33,825
Same as always.

602
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:35,327
They just don't understand.

603
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:37,263
Well, I don't
understand either.

604
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:40,966
How could you see our Jamie
and not go to fetch him?

605
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:44,436
Ain't no words to
some things, Mother.

606
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:46,438
I'm scared, Pa.

607
00:36:46,472 --> 00:36:49,408
That car by the barn and
that blood in the fields.

608
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,977
Something's very wrong here,
and you know what it is.

609
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,880
You've got to tell me.

610
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:57,816
The Lord works in
mysterious ways.

611
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,452
I'm waiting for divine guidance.

612
00:37:00,486 --> 00:37:03,555
The Lord will tell us
in his own good time.

613
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,492
Jamie?

614
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:07,693
Is that you?

615
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,703
I get so worried.

616
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:22,374
Even though Ross put
that fence up after Amy,

617
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:23,609
I still get frightened
when she's out there.

618
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,015
You can't keep her
inside all day, Cleo.

619
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:34,686
Why are you Julie?

620
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,688
Why is John?

621
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:39,725
And all those terrible books--
flying saucers, ghosts,

622
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,026
witches.

623
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,661
What do they have to
do with my little girl?

624
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:43,729
Nothing, Cleo.

625
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,597
Nothing.

626
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:48,967
Ross only asked John down
here because-- because they're

627
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,035
old friends.

628
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:53,405
He thought maybe John
would think of something.

629
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:56,375
Oh, honey, the
books don't matter.

630
00:37:56,408 --> 00:37:58,377
They're not real.

631
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:01,747
John only wrote those stories
to make extra money for us.

632
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,749
They're horrible.

633
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,084
They hurt people and
they frightened them.

634
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,787
Why does John want
to frighten people?

635
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,622
What kind of person is he?

636
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:11,590
Cara, honey, what's the matter?

637
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,624
Mommy's busy.

638
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:14,460
I have no one to play with me.

639
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:16,762
What do you mean, baby?

640
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,029
Where's Mary Rose?

641
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,097
She went away with the woodies.

642
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,499
Can I have a cookie?

643
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:44,356
We couldn't cover this
forest in 1,000 years,

644
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,393
not even with the
National Guard.

645
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:51,430
John, I can't wait any longer.

646
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:53,365
Can you get that mind
reader down here now?

647
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,572
John?

648
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:01,973
John?

649
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,542
Hm?

650
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:05,611
Are you really bringing
that psychic down here?

651
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:08,046
Mm-hmm.

652
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,515
How can you carry
this farce so far?

653
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:16,755
How can you turn this
tragedy into a circus?

654
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:20,759
I don't understand why Ross
believes that trash you write.

655
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,562
I've had enough, Julie.

656
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:27,533
I wrote the truth in my books
as best I could perceive it.

657
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:29,401
While you were
lecturing politely

658
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:33,705
on Anglo-Saxon literature,
I was scraping up

659
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:37,476
every bit of information
I could find, pro and con,

660
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,945
for my case studies.

661
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:44,450
Believe me, my master's
thesis wasn't as thorough.

662
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:46,151
I don't understand you, Julie.

663
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:53,725
You-- you teach poetry, and yet
you lack the faculty of wonder.

664
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,063
It's almost as if
you were afraid

665
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:01,066
that-- that the
real facts of life

666
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:04,002
would somehow threaten
the popular opinions

667
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:08,774
of Short Hills, New Jersey.

668
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:09,641
Grow up, John.

669
00:40:09,675 --> 00:40:11,677
Please grow up.

670
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,746
Stop muddling in this
psychic nonsense.

671
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,748
You and Ross should
be out looking

672
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:21,853
for some kind of a pervert,
not a flying saucer or a ghost.

673
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:24,856
You're just a big kid who's
read too much science fiction,

674
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,526
and now you're pretending
that it's real.

675
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,427
For God's sakes, grow
up before it's too late.

676
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,698
Oh, my.

677
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:41,533
Yes.

678
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:44,035
Yes, indeed.

679
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:46,605
Anything, Mrs. Allegari?

680
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:47,573
Alice, dearie.

681
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:49,608
Just Alice.

682
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:52,611
You have to be patient
with these things.

683
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,613
Alice just got here
after a long trip, Ross.

684
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:55,781
She needs to be rested first.

685
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:58,016
John, I have to know.

686
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:59,851
You will, dearie.

687
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:00,652
You will.

688
00:42:00,686 --> 00:42:01,620
But Johnny is right.

689
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:04,055
I'll do much better
after I catch a few Z's.

690
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,156
What?

691
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,625
Sleep, dearie.

692
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,026
A short snooze.

693
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,227
But can't you tell me anything?
I mean, any little--

694
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,797
Your little girl is
still alive, dearie, if that's

695
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,032
what you want to know.

696
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:15,801
Only she's changed somehow.

697
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:17,669
How?

698
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:19,905
I don't know yet.

699
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:23,575
Let me take the dollie to my
cabin, and I'll sleep on it.

700
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:25,243
Too bad it's not one
of those GI Joes, huh?

701
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,716
Don't worry, dearie.

702
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:34,052
I'll pick up the
vibrations, like a plant--

703
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:36,121
you know os-moozis.

704
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,957
That's osmosis, Mrs. Allegari.

705
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,592
Right, dearie.

706
00:42:40,626 --> 00:42:41,793
Hold onto him, John.

707
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:42,694
He's a smart one.

708
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:47,833
Is the new calf gonna
be all right, Pa?

709
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,100
Fine.

710
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:50,736
I'll fetch you something
to eat right away.

711
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,698
Jamie?

712
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:20,231
Jamie?

713
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,340
Don't go outside, Mary.

714
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:30,876
Why not?

715
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:31,609
Mind me.

716
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,782
Jamie?

717
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:37,315
Jamie?

718
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,825
The Lord is my shepherd.

719
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:49,260
I shall not want.

720
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:52,230
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

721
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,065
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

722
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:55,734
He restoreth my soul.

723
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:05,711
Afternoon, gentlemen.

724
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:07,278
I got that report on
Mr. Ludwig, Sheriff.

725
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:08,079
Good.

726
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:09,815
Let's have it.

727
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:11,717
Seems Ludwig was due to check
in with the folks at Beebs

728
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,819
Bibles yesterday, but they
haven't heard hide nor hare

729
00:44:13,852 --> 00:44:15,320
from him.

730
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:17,723
Is it usual for Mr. Ludwig
to go AWOL from his company?

731
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:18,824
No, sir.

732
00:44:18,857 --> 00:44:21,693
He's their best salesman
and regular like clockwork.

733
00:44:21,727 --> 00:44:24,395
He hasn't miss a
check-in in 12 years.

734
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:26,031
There's something there, Ross.

735
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:28,033
I know there is-- some tie-in.

736
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:30,035
We have to be cautious, John.

737
00:44:30,068 --> 00:44:32,437
We don't know that for sure.

738
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,504
Well, one thing's for certain.

739
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:38,009
We're going to pay our
friend Mr. Braun a visit.

740
00:44:38,043 --> 00:44:43,048
But first, I want to get Mrs.
Allegari back in the office.

741
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,016
I have to know about Mary Rose.

742
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:45,817
Give her a call.

743
00:44:45,851 --> 00:44:46,317
See if she's up yet.

744
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:50,155
Hello, Mabel?

745
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,456
This is Sheriff Carr.

746
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:53,825
Would you ring Mrs.
Allegari's cabin for me?

747
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:54,425
I think it's number 12.

748
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:07,873
Hello?

749
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:08,807
Thank you, dearie.

750
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,310
I had a very good rest.

751
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:13,812
15 minutes will be fine.

752
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:15,280
I'll be ready, dearie.

753
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:16,014
Bye-bye.

754
00:45:22,821 --> 00:45:24,222
What are you trying
to tell me, dearie?

755
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:03,394
Dearie?

756
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:05,496
Where are you off to, dearie?

757
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,433
I want to talk to you.

758
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:09,067
Slow down.

759
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,802
I can't keep up with you.

760
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:11,536
Dearie?

761
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:12,437
Dearie, please.

762
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,171
Slow down.

763
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:19,210
Not so fast, dearie.

764
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:21,046
I can't keep up.

765
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,848
No more.

766
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:27,452
My legs ain't what they used to
be when I was a child your age.

767
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:28,887
You want to come
home with me, dearie?

768
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,123
Your mommy and daddy
miss you, Mary Rose.

769
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,964
Hello, dearies.

770
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:41,432
Are these your
friends, Mary Rose?

771
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:42,968
Hold it right there.
I don't want to hurt you.

772
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:43,601
Don't come any closer.

773
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,203
What do you want?

774
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:47,138
Why won't you speak?

775
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,141
Ow.

776
00:46:50,175 --> 00:46:51,009
Come on, come on.

777
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:52,343
Put those things down.
Put those down.

778
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:53,178
Put them down.

779
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:54,846
Put those things down.

780
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,981
Go, go.

781
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:56,982
Ow, ow, ow!

782
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:57,983
Come on.

783
00:46:58,016 --> 00:46:58,950
Put that down.

784
00:46:58,984 --> 00:46:59,918
I'm a nice little lady.

785
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:00,986
Don't do that.

786
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:02,153
No, your mom and dad would
be very angry at you.

787
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,589
Oh, my baby.

788
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:08,026
Did you hear something?

789
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:09,627
No.

790
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,129
Gulp the blood.

791
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:12,597
Gobble the flesh.

792
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,599
Tear it to pieces.

793
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:16,101
Bite through the bone.

794
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:17,602
Gulp the blood.

795
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:18,603
Gobble the flesh.

796
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,105
Tear it to pieces.

797
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:22,107
Bite--

798
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,975
What was that?

799
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:24,509
Nothing.

800
00:47:29,214 --> 00:47:30,115
Try some.
It's good.

801
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:30,848
OK.

802
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:36,888
It was definitely
a woman screaming.

803
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:40,391
Wait.

804
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:41,326
Where are you going?

805
00:47:51,669 --> 00:47:52,537
Oh, my god!

806
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:02,380
Doctor, I've seen a lot,
but nothing like this.

807
00:48:02,413 --> 00:48:03,915
Go tell the sheriff we're
bringing the body out now.

808
00:48:11,456 --> 00:48:13,258
And this woman was
just lying on the ground

809
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:15,326
with all this blood.

810
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,295
And then they started
this horrible chanting.

811
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:18,296
Oh, god.

812
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:19,497
It was so awful.

813
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:20,398
Chanting?

814
00:48:20,431 --> 00:48:21,699
What do you mean?

815
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,301
You know, like reciting
something together.

816
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:24,669
What'd they say?

817
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:26,371
Hard to remember it all.

818
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:30,475
Something like, tear up, bite
her bones, swallow her blood.

819
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:31,576
No, not swallow.

820
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:34,345
It was more like-- like, gulp.

821
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:35,480
Gulp her blood.

822
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:36,514
Yeah, and gobble her flesh.

823
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:37,715
Oh, god.

824
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:38,984
I think I'm going
to be sick again.

825
00:48:39,017 --> 00:48:40,185
- Can I go?
- Sure.

826
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:41,186
I mean to talk to you later.

827
00:48:46,191 --> 00:48:47,225
Did you catch all that?

828
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,493
I think so.

829
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:49,594
I'll double check
with them when they're

830
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:52,063
feeling a little less queasy.

831
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:54,165
What do you make of it,
some kind of voodoo thing?

832
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:57,068
It's not like any voodoo
ritual I've ever heard of.

833
00:48:57,102 --> 00:48:59,204
And believe me, in my business,
I've heard of a lot of them.

834
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:03,008
A whole group of kids chanting
and acting like savages.

835
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,143
Do you think my
kids are with them?

836
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:06,677
I don't know, Ross.

837
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:10,215
Alice said that Mary
Rose was somehow changed.

838
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:11,749
I liked her, John.

839
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,285
I believe she would
have helped us.

840
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:15,353
I'm sorry.

841
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:16,621
Me too.

842
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:19,624
Sheriff, the body's
coming out now.

843
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:21,759
Uh, I looked everywhere.

844
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,561
There's no sign of it.

845
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:24,595
What?

846
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:26,764
Mary Rose's doll.

847
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,567
Well, Mr. DeWolfe,
looks like the makings

848
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,469
for another bestseller here.

849
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:34,339
That lady was my
friend, Miss Hawthorne.

850
00:49:34,372 --> 00:49:37,475
So who says bestsellers
can't be about friends,

851
00:49:37,508 --> 00:49:40,611
especially mystical friends?

852
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:44,715
We don't need all this
hocus-pocus, Sheriff.

853
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:46,751
Damn it, our wives and
kids are getting scared

854
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:48,753
to walk the dog to the corner.

855
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:54,359
Come to think of it, I'd rather
let him go on the rug myself.

856
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:56,361
Stay calm, Josiah.

857
00:49:56,394 --> 00:49:59,697
Sheriff Carr has
everything under control.

858
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,566
Before the next two
or three kids vanish,

859
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,536
I'm sure his author friend will
have discovered a spaceship

860
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:07,238
from Saturn that's
been playing the Pied

861
00:50:07,272 --> 00:50:08,806
Piper for the past three years.

862
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,708
Isn't that right, Mr. DeWolfe?

863
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:13,078
That's your story,
Miss Hawthorne.

864
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:16,514
Why don't you put it in a
hopper and let it rotate?

865
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:18,383
And he's rude too.

866
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:19,384
How about that, folks?

867
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:20,685
When are you going to
do something, Sheriff?

868
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:21,686
Yeah, we voted you in.

869
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:22,787
We can vote you out.

870
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,754
You voted for him.

871
00:50:23,788 --> 00:50:24,722
I didn't.

872
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,558
We don't care about
all this crap, Sheriff.

873
00:50:27,592 --> 00:50:30,161
We want our families to be safe.

874
00:50:31,296 --> 00:50:32,297
Whose kids are next, Sheriff?

875
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,798
Yeah!

876
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,301
And if you can't handle it,
we'll see to it ourselves.

877
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:42,273
How nice to incite a riot.

878
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:43,241
Ta-ta.

879
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:47,778
Sheriff, Mr. DeWolfe.

880
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:52,317
Oh, and remember, the
medium is the message.

881
00:51:30,688 --> 00:51:31,389
Mr. Braun?

882
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:38,796
Mr. Braun?

883
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,202
Please, Mr. Braun.

884
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:46,904
I'll only take a few minutes.

885
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,607
I know the sheriff was out
here yesterday, Mr. Braun.

886
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,209
Why?

887
00:51:51,242 --> 00:51:53,444
What did he hope to
find after a full year?

888
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:10,328
Mr. Braun?

889
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:17,335
Mr. Braun?

890
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:26,211
Mrs. Braun, hello!

891
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:27,144
Mrs. Braun?

892
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:44,795
Mrs. Braun?

893
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:47,498
Mrs. Braun?

894
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:48,799
Mrs. Braun?

895
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,971
Now.

896
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,961
We still have to drive
over to Braun's farm

897
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:54,532
and check on Ludwig's car.

898
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:57,335
John, what that young
couple heard, don't you

899
00:53:57,368 --> 00:53:59,003
have any idea what it means?

900
00:53:59,036 --> 00:54:00,971
No.

901
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:03,774
They kept repeating
four main words--

902
00:54:03,808 --> 00:54:08,045
tear, bite, gulp, and gobble.

903
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,449
Like some kind of savage ritual.

904
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:13,784
Sounds like "Beowulf."

905
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:16,487
What?

906
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:18,623
Sounds like "Beowulf."

907
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:21,392
You remember, John--
the Anglo-Saxon epic.

908
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:22,460
Angle what?

909
00:54:22,493 --> 00:54:24,462
Anglo-Saxon.

910
00:54:24,495 --> 00:54:27,498
Anglo-Saxon was the language
that preceded English.

911
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:29,934
"Beowulf" was the
story of a Viking hero

912
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:32,637
who roamed the country
conquering monsters.

913
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,673
When John said gulp and
gobble, it reminded me

914
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:38,443
of Anglo-Saxon
alliteration-- successions

915
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:39,644
of the same initial sound.

916
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:40,511
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

917
00:54:40,545 --> 00:54:42,947
Julie may have
something there, Ross.

918
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,683
What was it that
farmer Braun said?

919
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:47,985
Here.

920
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,987
Giants and goblins
who battle with God.

921
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,055
See?

922
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:54,992
That succession of G
sounds-- goblins, god, gulp,

923
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:58,529
gobble-- typical
Anglo-Saxon poetry.

924
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:00,331
But that doesn't make sense.

925
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:03,033
Why would children run
around eating people and then

926
00:55:03,067 --> 00:55:05,035
quoting angel-axon poetry?

927
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:06,737
Where would they have hear it?

928
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:08,873
Anglo-Saxon.

929
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:11,476
And that sounds like "Beowulf."

930
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:13,110
I think you'll find
those lines in a story

931
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,413
about a monster named Grendel.

932
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:18,416
But why Grendel?

933
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:18,983
Grendel was a cannibal.

934
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:23,588
Let's get to the office.

935
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,928
Maybe the files.

936
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:33,931
I'll call Dr. Fish and have
him meet us over there.

937
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:35,633
Oh, Julie.

938
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,868
Lock the door afterwards.

939
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:39,770
And don't let in anyone
who speaks in alliteration.

940
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:49,980
I can't rest.

941
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:51,148
I can't sleep.

942
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:52,983
I just need
something to calm me.

943
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:53,784
Let me make you a cup of tea.

944
00:55:53,818 --> 00:55:55,686
No, sit down.

945
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,454
Let me do it.

946
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:04,094
I told Cara to be quiet.

947
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:04,929
Now she's going to get it.

948
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:08,799
Here it is.

949
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,535
A college professor
named Randall

950
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:13,404
disappeared about 10 years ago.

951
00:56:13,438 --> 00:56:16,040
What did he teach?

952
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:17,975
Medieval English,
Old English, and--

953
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:18,809
Yeah?

954
00:56:18,843 --> 00:56:19,544
Anglo-Saxon.

955
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:28,953
Is Cara all right?

956
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:42,833
Julie?

957
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:49,774
Julie!

958
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:03,654
Cara!

959
00:57:03,688 --> 00:57:05,556
Can I take two?

960
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:06,557
No.

961
00:57:06,591 --> 00:57:07,992
You can only take one.

962
00:57:08,025 --> 00:57:09,026
Why don't you take this one?

963
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:10,795
I want to take Marianne.

964
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:16,000
Cara!

965
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:17,602
Look Aunt Cleo, it's Mary Rose.

966
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:18,135
Get her!

967
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:30,481
A formidable monster,
there's Grendel.

968
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:32,717
It seems he felt
himself an outcast

969
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,986
of society, scorned, ridiculed.

970
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:38,956
So he took his revenge out
on the king and his soldiers.

971
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:41,125
Now, according to
this book-- here

972
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:46,130
it is-- he could carry off and
eat a dozen warriors at a time.

973
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:48,165
Some appetite.

974
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:49,099
Look at this.

975
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,801
He was also invulnerable.

976
00:57:50,835 --> 00:57:53,971
You see how the swords and
spears are useless against him?

977
00:57:54,004 --> 00:57:56,206
The hero, Beowulf,
literally had to pull

978
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,576
him apart with his bare hands.

979
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:00,778
And even with one arm
torn away, Grendel

980
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:04,515
still managed to crawl off into
the woods and die by himself.

981
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,127
-Aunt Cleo!
-Quiet.

982
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:18,663
You're coming with us.

983
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:19,930
I hope you're finding
something, gentlemen.

984
00:58:19,964 --> 00:58:22,700
The librarian's having kittens
about having to come back here

985
00:58:22,733 --> 00:58:23,668
in the middle of the night.

986
00:58:23,701 --> 00:58:27,772
Well, we're learning
more about the monster.

987
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:30,074
I still can't see what all
this has to do with the kids,

988
00:58:30,107 --> 00:58:31,075
though.

989
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:32,610
What'd you find out, Ross?

990
00:58:32,643 --> 00:58:35,145
The college chancellor
knew Randall very well.

991
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,948
Said he was a brilliant
and exceptional scholar.

992
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:40,885
Could quote freely from any
of the literature he taught.

993
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:43,588
In all other respects,
he was a solid citizen.

994
00:58:43,621 --> 00:58:46,090
The least likely candidate
for the loony bin.

995
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:48,125
His only hobby was camping.

996
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:50,327
That's when he vanished,
after a weekend trip

997
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,262
with his eight-year-old
son, Glenn.

998
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:54,832
Neither one was ever seen again.

999
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,767
What does that tell us?

1000
00:58:56,801 --> 00:58:58,335
I don't know yet.

1001
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,237
But this has to be a
major breakthrough.

1002
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:04,609
If Julie's right, and all the
evidence indicates that she is,

1003
00:59:04,642 --> 00:59:06,644
then Professor
Randall's our only clue.

1004
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:09,079
He has to be involved somehow.

1005
00:59:09,113 --> 00:59:12,116
Who else could have taught
the kids those lines?

1006
00:59:12,149 --> 00:59:12,850
The boy Glenn?

1007
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:19,089
Glenn Randall.

1008
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:20,691
Grendel.

1009
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:21,358
Glenn Randall.

1010
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,693
What's that suggest to you?

1011
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:28,766
Get out!

1012
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,034
Get out of here!

1013
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,836
Get out!

1014
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:33,604
Get out of here!

1015
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:34,138
Out!

1016
00:59:39,777 --> 00:59:40,277
Cara!

1017
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:46,150
All right.

1018
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:48,285
How do we connect
a professor who

1019
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,321
vanished 10 years
ago with a bunch

1020
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:56,326
of kids who act like
cannibals and spout poetry?

1021
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,229
What do we know
about his home life?

1022
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:01,398
Did he have a happy marriage?

1023
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,001
I mean, could he have been
despondent when he walked off

1024
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:06,003
into the woods that last time?

1025
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,404
The chancellor said the
marriage was a good one

1026
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,740
by all outward appearances.

1027
01:00:09,774 --> 01:00:11,676
At any rate, Mrs. Randall
still lives in the area,

1028
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:12,576
and she hasn't remarried.

1029
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,946
You can check with
her in the morning.

1030
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,047
What do we do in the meantime?

1031
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:20,851
We go back to the
office and check the files.

1032
01:00:20,885 --> 01:00:22,853
We have to be
positive about this.

1033
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:25,022
We can't afford to have
overlooked anything

1034
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:27,725
or get trapped into
a wild goose chase.

1035
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:29,994
If there's a possibility
other than Randall,

1036
01:00:30,027 --> 01:00:32,730
we better check it out.

1037
01:00:32,763 --> 01:00:35,265
I don't want to reopen old
wounds for Mrs. Randall

1038
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:38,368
unless it's
absolutely necessary.

1039
01:00:38,402 --> 01:00:39,103
I have sinned.

1040
01:00:41,939 --> 01:00:44,308
We all have sinned.

1041
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:47,311
We have committed
the sin of Jonah.

1042
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:51,716
We have denied who
and what we are.

1043
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:55,419
And like Jonah, we haven't
imperiled our community.

1044
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:57,755
Only an act of faith
can save us now.

1045
01:00:57,788 --> 01:01:00,024
We must admit our
heritage and throw

1046
01:01:00,057 --> 01:01:02,092
ourselves upon the waters.

1047
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:06,463
We must don our
armor once again,

1048
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:10,868
even against those demons in
the shape of our children.

1049
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:13,103
There can be no exceptions.

1050
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:14,138
We must cleanse ourselves.

1051
01:01:19,877 --> 01:01:22,913
The wages of sin is death.

1052
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,819
There's one positive
lead we can check on right now.

1053
01:01:28,853 --> 01:01:29,787
What's
That?

1054
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,188
Ludwig's car.

1055
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,157
I'm not finished
with Mr. Braun yet.

1056
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:33,891
Let's do it.

1057
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,633
But I don't want to.

1058
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,301
Don't be such a baby.

1059
01:04:31,335 --> 01:04:32,502
Grendel says it's your job.

1060
01:06:53,377 --> 01:06:55,212
Mr. Braun?

1061
01:06:55,245 --> 01:06:55,745
Mr. Braun?

1062
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:05,455
Looks like nobody's home.

1063
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:07,824
Looks like.

1064
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,527
Wonder why he left
the lights on.

1065
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,097
Maybe he's coming right back.

1066
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:14,464
Yeah.

1067
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:15,199
Maybe.

1068
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:21,305
Is there anywhere around
here they might have gone?

1069
01:07:21,338 --> 01:07:24,341
Neighbors, bar, or something?

1070
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:25,675
No place near.

1071
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:29,779
This areas all fields
and woods and marshes.

1072
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:32,449
In town, they pull the
sidewalks in around 9 o'clock.

1073
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:34,384
That was three hours ago.

1074
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:38,155
Wherever he is, his
wife must be with him.

1075
01:07:38,188 --> 01:07:41,525
Is there any reason he
might go out in the field?

1076
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:42,826
I can't imagine why.

1077
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:44,361
Sheriff
Carr, this is Luke.

1078
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,162
Do you copy?

1079
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:46,463
I'll check out front.

1080
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:48,865
OK.

1081
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:50,367
Carr, this is Luke.

1082
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,702
Do you copy?

1083
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:55,605
Ross, you out there?

1084
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:56,606
This is Carr.

1085
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:57,841
What's going on, Luke?

1086
01:07:57,874 --> 01:08:02,146
I think we've
got a problem here, Sheriff.

1087
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:03,380
How big a problem?

1088
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,282
I think you
should get back to the office

1089
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:07,617
right away.

1090
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:08,485
OK, Luke.

1091
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:09,219
10-8.

1092
01:08:12,656 --> 01:08:14,258
Just got a call from Luke.

1093
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:16,826
There's some kind of
disturbance in town.

1094
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:19,163
Something's wrong
here too, Ross.

1095
01:08:19,196 --> 01:08:20,063
I'm going to stay
and wait for Braun.

1096
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,432
You come back and
get me when you can.

1097
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:25,735
John, you sure
you'll be OK here?

1098
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:26,536
Fine.

1099
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:28,472
Now, get going.

1100
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:30,240
Stay loose.

1101
01:08:30,274 --> 01:08:31,575
Remember you're
deputized now, buddy.

1102
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,945
Hey, stop it.

1103
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:10,414
Cut it out.

1104
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:11,681
Stop it.

1105
01:09:11,715 --> 01:09:12,882
The outlander must die.

1106
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:13,950
Kill.

1107
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:14,884
Cut it out.

1108
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:50,454
Glenn.

1109
01:09:50,487 --> 01:09:52,956
Glenn.

1110
01:09:52,989 --> 01:09:53,690
Glenn!

1111
01:09:58,462 --> 01:09:59,929
Glenn?

1112
01:09:59,963 --> 01:10:00,664
Glenn!

1113
01:10:03,733 --> 01:10:04,901
Glenn!

1114
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:05,635
Oh.

1115
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:47,577
Please, Mr. Braun, please.

1116
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:48,612
Please.

1117
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:49,946
What's going on here, everybody?

1118
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:51,014
Come on.

1119
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:52,649
You're acting like a bunch
of children out here.

1120
01:10:56,386 --> 01:10:57,321
Here's the sheriff, finally.

1121
01:10:57,354 --> 01:10:58,888
What's this all about?

1122
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,690
The usual, except
someone's really

1123
01:11:00,724 --> 01:11:01,991
stirred them up this time.

1124
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:07,364
If you were doing
your jobs, we wouldn't

1125
01:11:07,397 --> 01:11:08,565
have to do it ourselves.

1126
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:10,300
Folks!

1127
01:11:10,334 --> 01:11:12,602
Folks, let me have
your attention, please.

1128
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,873
Thanks.

1129
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:19,776
We have an important
new lead tonight.

1130
01:11:19,809 --> 01:11:22,979
And we're following
up on it right now.

1131
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,914
Try to be patient a
little while longer.

1132
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:32,522
What new lead?

1133
01:11:32,556 --> 01:11:36,560
I can't tell
you right now.

1134
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:39,596
You can't
tell us nothing.

1135
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:41,431
You never answer nothing.

1136
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:44,100
You don't catch nothing.

1137
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,702
You're kind of an
all-around nothing.

1138
01:11:49,506 --> 01:11:52,709
You got no call to
do that, Luke Domain.

1139
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:53,042
Remember who you are.

1140
01:11:56,846 --> 01:12:02,352
That was before, Mr. Modicah,
before my time and yours.

1141
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:03,520
That don't matter now.

1142
01:12:09,759 --> 01:12:12,496
It matters.

1143
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:14,998
It still matters.

1144
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:17,033
You'll see, Luke.

1145
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:17,967
Blood will tell.

1146
01:12:22,406 --> 01:12:24,073
What's he mean, Luke?

1147
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:25,542
What blood?

1148
01:12:25,575 --> 01:12:27,411
Don't mean nothing, Sheriff.

1149
01:12:27,444 --> 01:12:28,077
That was before.

1150
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:29,112
That don't mean nothing now.

1151
01:12:31,948 --> 01:12:32,816
You see?

1152
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:36,119
He never answers nothing.

1153
01:12:36,152 --> 01:12:37,954
The only time he's
on the spot is

1154
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:40,356
when that smart little
reporter gal comes around.

1155
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:45,762
Where is she now?

1156
01:12:45,795 --> 01:12:47,130
How come Miss Hawthorne
isn't here now?

1157
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:52,569
She ask too many questions
for nothing answers?

1158
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:58,041
You get her
transferred, Sheriff?

1159
01:12:58,074 --> 01:13:01,110
I don't know where
Miss Hawthorne is.

1160
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:02,979
But I'm sure she'll
turn up soon.

1161
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,794
Him also, Lord.

1162
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:54,564
He too is father
to Satan's spawn.

1163
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:57,634
Sluts and consorts of Beelzebub.

1164
01:13:57,667 --> 01:14:00,737
Oh, star of the morning,
how thou has fallen.

1165
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:04,674
All-- all agents of hell,
young whores of Beelzebub.

1166
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:07,711
Mister, if you're calling
my little girls whores,

1167
01:14:07,744 --> 01:14:11,180
I'm going to cut your tongue
out with a linoleum knife.

1168
01:14:11,214 --> 01:14:12,616
Now, what do you know
about this Braun?

1169
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:13,617
Make it quick.

1170
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:14,884
Goblins.

1171
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:17,487
Goblins and giants
who battle with God.

1172
01:14:17,521 --> 01:14:20,056
That angel-axon poetry again.

1173
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:23,493
What the hell is going on
at your place anyway, Braun?

1174
01:14:23,527 --> 01:14:25,228
How come you left your house
open and the lights on?

1175
01:14:25,261 --> 01:14:26,563
I didn't do it.

1176
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:27,764
They did it.

1177
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:28,665
They did it.

1178
01:14:39,709 --> 01:14:41,778
Luke, keep them in line.

1179
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:48,184
When the time comes,
you too will join

1180
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:49,919
us in the sacrifice of Abraham.

1181
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:30,660
Amy!

1182
01:15:30,694 --> 01:15:33,096
Amy!

1183
01:15:33,129 --> 01:15:35,331
Amy!

1184
01:15:35,364 --> 01:15:36,566
Amy!

1185
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,035
Amy!

1186
01:15:39,068 --> 01:15:40,604
Grendel will pay you for this.

1187
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:43,339
He will avenge his
queen, his Wealtheow.

1188
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:45,942
Wealtheow was the
king's bride, Amy.

1189
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:47,310
I am not Amy.

1190
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:49,178
I am Wealtheow.

1191
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:50,880
Grendel has stolen me
from the king's house,

1192
01:15:50,914 --> 01:15:52,048
and I am his alone.

1193
01:15:52,081 --> 01:15:57,320
Amy, it's me, your Uncle John.

1194
01:15:57,353 --> 01:15:59,923
Your mother and father
are heart-sick over you.

1195
01:15:59,956 --> 01:16:02,892
I have no mother,
and I have no father.

1196
01:16:02,926 --> 01:16:04,360
They did not come from me.

1197
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,995
Grendel said they
would not come for me.

1198
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:07,631
I have only Grendel.

1199
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:08,965
Amy!

1200
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:11,234
Your parents tried
to find you, but

1201
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:14,771
this boy who thinks he's Grendel
hid you away deep in the woods.

1202
01:16:14,804 --> 01:16:16,172
They did not come.

1203
01:16:16,205 --> 01:16:17,373
He is Grendel.

1204
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,342
I am Wealtheow.

1205
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:22,245
We are demons, cast
out and cursed.

1206
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:23,813
Damned exiles.

1207
01:16:23,847 --> 01:16:25,248
We are angry.

1208
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:27,717
Angry and eager to kill.

1209
01:16:27,751 --> 01:16:28,885
Amy, stop.

1210
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:29,619
That's enough.

1211
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:45,001
Amy.

1212
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:49,405
Uncle John, will
you touch me now?

1213
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,908
What do you mean, Amy?

1214
01:16:51,941 --> 01:16:54,978
The way Grendel touched
mother when he tied her.

1215
01:16:55,011 --> 01:16:56,279
What?

1216
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:58,047
I won't mind.

1217
01:16:58,081 --> 01:16:58,715
Grendel touched mother.

1218
01:16:58,748 --> 01:17:00,416
Why shouldn't you touch me?

1219
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,820
My god, Amy.

1220
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:06,255
Where's Cleo?

1221
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:09,425
And where is Aunt Julie?

1222
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:10,226
How could you not--

1223
01:17:10,259 --> 01:17:10,960
Uncle John!

1224
01:17:14,097 --> 01:17:18,001
You know, I've always liked you,
even when I was a little girl.

1225
01:17:18,034 --> 01:17:19,235
That's enough!

1226
01:17:19,268 --> 01:17:21,204
Now, stop it.

1227
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:22,338
Where is my wife?

1228
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:27,243
And Cara.

1229
01:17:27,276 --> 01:17:28,211
Is Cara--

1230
01:17:28,244 --> 01:17:31,314
Cara learns the exile
way, the magic song

1231
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:32,816
of the outcast fiend.

1232
01:17:32,849 --> 01:17:33,416
Amy!

1233
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:37,320
Come on.

1234
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:58,007
Ross!

1235
01:17:58,041 --> 01:17:59,008
Wait!

1236
01:17:59,042 --> 01:17:59,943
Get back in the car.

1237
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:04,914
John?

1238
01:18:09,152 --> 01:18:09,919
Ross!

1239
01:18:09,953 --> 01:18:11,087
Get in the car!

1240
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,389
They're here, all over.

1241
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:14,357
What?

1242
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,091
No!

1243
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:37,480
No!

1244
01:18:40,516 --> 01:18:42,919
Grendel's children
will die tonight

1245
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:44,520
on the flesh of their enemies.

1246
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:47,757
He was your father, Amy.

1247
01:18:47,791 --> 01:18:49,192
A good man who loved you.

1248
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:51,494
I have no father.

1249
01:18:51,527 --> 01:18:53,329
Only Grendel.

1250
01:18:53,362 --> 01:18:54,263
Come on.

1251
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:01,004
I've got to get
out of here, Amy.

1252
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:01,670
Wealtheow!

1253
01:19:01,704 --> 01:19:03,940
And I'm taking you with me.

1254
01:19:03,973 --> 01:19:05,775
I've got to get you to the
town and show the people

1255
01:19:05,809 --> 01:19:06,709
what's happening here.

1256
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:09,879
He will never let
you take me from him.

1257
01:19:09,913 --> 01:19:10,379
We'll see.

1258
01:19:17,821 --> 01:19:18,521
Stay there.

1259
01:19:30,867 --> 01:19:31,367
Come on.

1260
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:52,956
Grendel!

1261
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:53,489
Grendel!

1262
01:19:59,095 --> 01:19:59,795
Grendel!

1263
01:20:02,966 --> 01:20:03,466
Grendel!

1264
01:20:06,936 --> 01:20:07,436
Grendel!

1265
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:12,541
Grendel!

1266
01:20:28,457 --> 01:20:30,927
You're going home, Amy.

1267
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,297
And we'll get you de-programmed
or whatever they call it.

1268
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,165
There's nothing for you there.

1269
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:38,968
The dark death's shadow
holds you no hope.

1270
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:40,970
Then we'll come back
here and you'll show us

1271
01:20:41,004 --> 01:20:41,537
where Grendel's camp is.

1272
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:51,080
These people come in here,
telling us what to do.

1273
01:20:51,114 --> 01:20:52,081
Stay down.

1274
01:20:52,115 --> 01:20:52,581
Don't make a sound.

1275
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:10,099
Mr. DeWolfe,
where's the sheriff?

1276
01:21:10,133 --> 01:21:11,200
Dead.

1277
01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:12,301
He's dead.

1278
01:21:12,335 --> 01:21:14,103
Luke, I need your help.

1279
01:21:14,137 --> 01:21:15,571
I know where the children are.

1280
01:21:15,604 --> 01:21:18,207
Something happened
out at the house.

1281
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:20,076
Mrs. Carr, your wife,
and daughter are missing.

1282
01:21:20,109 --> 01:21:21,677
I found blood on the staircase.

1283
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,980
We can find them, Luke.

1284
01:21:24,013 --> 01:21:26,049
For Christ's sake,
you've got to help me.

1285
01:21:26,082 --> 01:21:27,116
Come on.

1286
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:29,252
These aren't kids.

1287
01:21:29,285 --> 01:21:30,186
They are demons.

1288
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:30,920
Luke!

1289
01:21:34,123 --> 01:21:36,159
One of those who
would stand in our way.

1290
01:21:36,192 --> 01:21:37,961
What?

1291
01:21:37,994 --> 01:21:40,629
This man stands in the
face of heaven's will.

1292
01:21:40,663 --> 01:21:42,431
He would stay the
hand of Abraham.

1293
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:43,432
Abraham?

1294
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:45,234
What are you talking about?

1295
01:21:45,268 --> 01:21:49,072
But just as Abraham was called
upon to sacrifice his son,

1296
01:21:49,105 --> 01:21:52,108
so too are we called
upon to sacrifice,

1297
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:56,612
to cleanse ourselves, to purge
our soul of the darkness.

1298
01:21:56,645 --> 01:21:57,346
Sacrifice?

1299
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:04,287
Are you talking about
killing your own children?

1300
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,455
Are you crazy?

1301
01:22:06,489 --> 01:22:08,491
There's no devil here.

1302
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:11,094
It's just your children being
led by a boy who's been lost

1303
01:22:11,127 --> 01:22:12,661
in the mountains for 10 years.

1304
01:22:12,695 --> 01:22:13,429
Luke, tell them.

1305
01:22:23,206 --> 01:22:24,140
No!

1306
01:22:24,173 --> 01:22:25,608
Do not fear!

1307
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:27,143
I know where he goes.

1308
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:29,412
He shall not escape our net.

1309
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:32,448
Come to my farm now.

1310
01:22:32,481 --> 01:22:33,582
The upper pasture!

1311
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:43,159
Now you too are in
exile, cursed and outcast.

1312
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:44,693
Shut up.

1313
01:22:44,727 --> 01:22:47,330
I'm going to save my
wife and daughter.

1314
01:22:47,363 --> 01:22:48,397
Where is the camp?

1315
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:50,033
The wild land.

1316
01:22:50,066 --> 01:22:50,699
The lonely land.

1317
01:22:50,733 --> 01:22:51,600
The land of wolf places.

1318
01:23:02,145 --> 01:23:03,479
You must hurry, Uncle John.

1319
01:23:03,512 --> 01:23:06,282
The sun is ahead of you.

1320
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:10,486
I will take you there gladly,
for you will never return.

1321
01:23:10,519 --> 01:23:13,556
And if you hurry, you may be on
time for the ceremony of dawn.

1322
01:23:13,589 --> 01:23:15,391
And you may even see
Cara consume my mother's

1323
01:23:15,424 --> 01:23:17,360
living spirit,.

1324
01:23:17,393 --> 01:23:18,361
What does that mean?

1325
01:23:18,394 --> 01:23:19,395
How could I tell you?

1326
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:22,431
That would spoil the surprise.

1327
01:23:22,465 --> 01:23:23,699
Tear it to pieces.

1328
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:25,368
Bite through the bone.

1329
01:23:25,401 --> 01:23:26,669
Gulp the blood.

1330
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:28,637
Gobble the flesh.

1331
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:29,605
Tear it to pieces.

1332
01:23:29,638 --> 01:23:31,307
Bite through the bone.

1333
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:32,575
Gulp the blood.

1334
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:33,576
Gobble the flesh.

1335
01:23:33,609 --> 01:23:35,544
Tear it to the pieces.

1336
01:23:35,578 --> 01:23:37,513
Bite through the bones.

1337
01:23:37,546 --> 01:23:38,481
Gulp the blood.

1338
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:39,482
Gobble the flesh.

1339
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:41,150
Tear it to pieces.

1340
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,151
Bite through the bones.

1341
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:43,419
Gulp the blood.

1342
01:23:43,452 --> 01:23:45,088
Gobble the flesh.

1343
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:47,090
Tear it to pieces.

1344
01:23:47,123 --> 01:23:48,357
Bite through the bones.

1345
01:23:48,391 --> 01:23:49,325
Gulp the blood.

1346
01:23:49,358 --> 01:23:50,626
Gobble the flesh.

1347
01:23:50,659 --> 01:23:51,427
Tear it to pieces.

1348
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,196
Bite through the bones.

1349
01:23:53,229 --> 01:23:54,363
Gulp the blood.

1350
01:23:54,397 --> 01:23:55,764
Gobble the flesh.

1351
01:23:55,798 --> 01:23:57,100
Tear it to pieces.

1352
01:23:57,133 --> 01:23:57,700
Bite through the bones.

1353
01:23:57,733 --> 01:23:59,202
Gulp the blood.

1354
01:23:59,235 --> 01:24:00,303
Gobble the flesh.

1355
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:01,670
Tear it to pieces.

1356
01:24:01,704 --> 01:24:03,506
Bite through the bones.

1357
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:04,473
Gulp the blood.

1358
01:24:04,507 --> 01:24:05,208
Gobble the flesh.

1359
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:25,428
Cleo.

1360
01:24:45,348 --> 01:24:46,615
I am Grendel!

1361
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:49,752
We are the goblins.

1362
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:50,486
Lunatic!

1363
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:59,328
I have your queen.

1364
01:24:59,362 --> 01:25:01,297
Come and get her,
Grendel, if you dare.

1365
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:06,635
This is Grendel's kill.

1366
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:42,805
Where's my daughter?

1367
01:26:08,697 --> 01:26:10,633
I knew.

1368
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:12,901
I knew all along.

1369
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:15,938
But I waited for divine guidance
to deliver them into our hands.

1370
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:22,945
You Bible-thumping moron.

1371
01:26:22,978 --> 01:26:25,581
These are children.

1372
01:26:25,614 --> 01:26:27,216
They need help.

1373
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:28,651
There's no danger here anymore.

1374
01:26:31,987 --> 01:26:36,525
Put down those damn rifles
before someone gets hurt.

1375
01:26:36,559 --> 01:26:41,464
Oh God, give us the strength
to complete this purification.

1376
01:26:41,497 --> 01:26:44,300
Let us not falter
in this last hour.

1377
01:26:49,572 --> 01:26:56,945
If one child is harmed, one
child, I'll have all of you

1378
01:26:56,979 --> 01:27:00,516
up on accessory
to murder charges.

1379
01:27:00,549 --> 01:27:01,484
Count on that.

1380
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:17,032
Grendel!

1381
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:24,940
No!

1382
01:27:31,447 --> 01:27:31,947
Mama!

1383
01:28:42,585 --> 01:28:43,085
No!
