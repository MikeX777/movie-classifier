1
00:00:03,625 --> 00:00:07,038
In 1945 the second world war
came to an end.

2
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:12,827
The German reich and the Japanese empire
were defeated by the allied forces.

3
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:16,165
In front of us is Germany,

4
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,824
within us marches Ghana.

5
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,492
The German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler
committed suicide,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,415
while Japanese military leader hideki tojo was
sentenced to death by a military tribunal.

7
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:32,200
Or at least that is what was
written in the history books.

8
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:42,655
In reality, Hitler and tojo
fled by submarine to Ghana,

9
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:45,203
where they are hiding to this day.

10
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,290
And it all shall be mine.

11
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:09,162
Among them also Hitler's most trusted
accomplice, horse-man goering.

12
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,369
I am horse-man goering.

13
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:13,373
No body can defeat goering.

14
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:17,242
They are raising hell in
their local communities and

15
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:23,162
smash everything and everyone in their way
with the superior Japanese karate skills.

16
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,705
Whazz up?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,786
Goering! Back off!

18
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:44,749
Thanks to the intense karate training,

19
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,290
and their Arian superpowers,

20
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,870
they managed to reverse their aging process

21
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:51,248
and they are stronger and more

22
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:52,953
Arian than ever before.

23
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,625
Hitler!

24
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:02,249
We will give you all that you need.

25
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:05,658
That's only thing we need from you.

26
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:07,911
Please provide us with ladies.

27
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,323
Beautiful ladies like these.

28
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:15,951
Hitler offers the local riches,
alcohol and women.

29
00:02:18,417 --> 00:02:21,250
But in reality he is brainwashing them

30
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:25,080
with a spell of the magical "blutfahne”,
or blood flag.

31
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:29,869
The new axis powers,

32
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:34,577
Germany, Japan and Ghana
have gathered a powerful army

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,958
calling themselves the ghan-arians.

34
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,162
This time without Italy,
because they suck at war.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,572
Nobody is safe from the spell
of the magical blutfahne.

36
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,744
And before you know it,

37
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:57,414
your father, your mother,
your brother, your sister,

38
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,367
might have already become a ghan-Arian...

39
00:03:01,917 --> 00:03:04,249
Mindless foot soldiers

40
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:09,241
whose sole mission is to create
a new joined kingdom of Hitler's 4th reich

41
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,874
and tojo"s new Japanese empire.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,241
Will anybody be able to stop them?

43
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:22,490
Or will Hitler and tojo finally
be able to conquer the world?

44
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:26,200
With their African kung fu Nazis!

45
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:38,907
Here he comes now! Lookin' good!

46
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,745
Hey addae, whaddup whaddup whaddup?

47
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:47,664
Addae, ma man!

48
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,994
Addae! Whaddup bro?

49
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,035
I miss you, baby.

50
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,828
You are looking so good.

51
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,456
All for you. But...

52
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,414
Don't forget our date tonight.

53
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:25,872
Of course, Eva.

54
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,457
I can't forget that. And I can't wait.

55
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,993
You are such a darling.

56
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:33,948
So happy.

57
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,911
I've got ready for training now though...

58
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,824
- Oh no.
- Yes.

59
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,369
- See you later.
- Ok

60
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:43,948
see you soon.

61
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,455
Take care.

62
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,125
Addae!

63
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:06,331
How's your kung fu training coming along?

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,661
Addae...

65
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:10,493
You're late again!

66
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:15,910
How do you ever expect to improve,
when you are not serious about training?

67
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,160
I am sorry, master.

68
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,285
You are sorry?

69
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,905
As usual when you're late,
10 minutes horse stance!

70
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,785
Go down, go down!

71
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,282
Now, as you all know,

72
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,873
there will be a great tournament.

73
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:13,080
And I expect everyone of you
to be at your best.

74
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,790
I expect you to fight with pride.

75
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:19,455
And bring honor to our
shadow snake school.

76
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,125
Remember!

77
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:26,031
There is no kung fu style that can beat
our shadow snake school.

78
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,583
Yes, master!

79
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,865
And as always,

80
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,871
akante will represent our school
for the tournament.

81
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,662
And I will give the opportunity
to another student,

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,163
who will also represent us
in the tournament.

83
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,908
Me, master! Please choose me!

84
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,125
Be silent!

85
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:54,203
The one who impresses me the most will be
the second fighter for the tournament.

86
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,576
And for you, addae,
you did not impress me today.

87
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,163
I will announce the second fighter
by the close of the day.

88
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,581
- Dispatch!
- Yes, master!

89
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,619
Now, assemble! Everyone!

90
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,035
Abeeku, step forward!

91
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,162
You will represent our second fighter
at the tournament.

92
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,573
Thank you, master.

93
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:22,864
It is a great honor.
I will not disappoint you.

94
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,074
- Join the queue.
- Thank you, master.

95
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,455
Now you can dismiss.

96
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,158
I believe master would have chosen you.

97
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:41,624
You just have to be more disciplined.

98
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,370
Otherwise you can never get to my level.

99
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,117
Anyway, have you heard about
this new tournament?

100
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,245
It's from a man called Adolf Hitler.

101
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,039
Hitler... funny name, right?

102
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:00,875
They call themselves the ghan-arians.

103
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,536
- Akante.
- What?

104
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:06,116
I don't know why master
is doing this to me.

105
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:09,373
You know, kung fu is all I have.

106
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,495
I thought master will
finially let me represent.

107
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,539
Represent what?

108
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:17,993
Cheer up my man.

109
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:22,365
You've got the most beautiful
girl in town and that is Eva.

110
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:26,739
You know what? I'll easily give up my spot
in the tournament

111
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,623
so that I can have a date with her.

112
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:33,367
No wait... I'd rather kick some ass.

113
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,990
That's my boy. Cheer up, man.

114
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:44,783
The ghan-arians do not even practice
Chinese kung fu.

115
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,241
They practice Japanese karate.

116
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,914
It's gonna be an easy win.

117
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,241
I think you've had enough already!
What's wrong with you.

118
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,616
I was hoping to have a
nice evening with you...

119
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,573
The master.

120
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,373
Again he didn't choose me.

121
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:29,827
When will he finally give me the chance
to represent our school? When?

122
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,706
Spare me with your whining addae!

123
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,790
What is it with that dumb kung fu anyway?

124
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,282
I love you, addae.

125
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,287
But it is time you get a job for a change.

126
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,832
Now let me tell you one secret.

127
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:48,991
My father would never alloe me to marry
a loser like you!

128
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,741
Please. You have to understand.

129
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:57,243
If I can make a name for myself
in the martial arts world,

130
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,911
I'll be rich and famous.

131
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,830
You'll never have to worry
about a thing anymore.

132
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,155
This is the perfect
chance for me, you know?

133
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,786
It's going to be an easy tournament.

134
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,655
It's by some guys who call
themselves ghan-arians.

135
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:21,660
They don't even practice kung fu,
but Japanese karate.

136
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,950
- Ghan-arians! Si!
- Ka!

137
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,118
We have seized the power in Ghana.

138
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:40,239
Now it's time to assimilate
the Ghanaian people.

139
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:46,157
We have gathered here today
to swear in two new comrades,

140
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,993
into our exclusive circle of ghan-arians.

141
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:53,989
Only the best of the best can join us

142
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:58,747
to fight for the advent of the 4th reich!

143
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,161
So

144
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:08,203
Now they shall swear the oath
to our beloved blutfahne.

145
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:19,992
One people, one reich, one leader.

146
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,575
You got dat right.

147
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:38,782
For leader, reich and fatherland.

148
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,202
Do you swear?

149
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,456
Yes, my fuherer!

150
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:53,207
In front of us is Ghana.
Within us marches Ghana.

151
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,784
Marching is cool.

152
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:02,114
Welcome our two new comrades
my dear Ghana-arians.

153
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:09,204
Are you two ready to fight
for the advent of the 4th German reich

154
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,576
and the new Japanese empire?

155
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,947
Ghana-arians, now to a
completely different topic.

156
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:26,785
As you all know, our great Ghana-Arian
tournament will start very soon.

157
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:34,280
Regarding this, a few words from
our axis partner hideki tojo.

158
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:38,749
Greetings.
A few remarks regarding

159
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:41,408
the upcoming martial arts
tournament.

160
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:45,330
No need to show any mercy
towards your opponents.

161
00:14:45,792 --> 00:14:48,909
Just exterminate
everyone in your way.

162
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,540
Every fight, shall be fought
to the death.

163
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,415
Chinese kung fu is crap.

164
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,745
Japanese karate is the only true
martial art.

165
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,698
Behold the beauty of Japan!
Hail the emperor of Japan!

166
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:16,988
Tomorrow, we shall go out and spread
the word of Japan's beauty

167
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:21,914
and recruit more soldiers for the
Japanese emperor and the German reich.

168
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,125
Dat's sit!

169
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:25,623
- Si!
- Ka!

170
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:33,659
One... two...
One... two... stop!

171
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:45,125
You may give me all your money for our
tournament and the emperor.

172
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:56,407
One... two... one... two... stop!

173
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:07,161
Mere woman, money out, for our
tournament and the emperor. Please.

174
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:13,242
My money? Hell nah!
Get outta here!

175
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:17,410
Oh, and hang up
this commercial for our tournament.

176
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:21,580
You gotta be joking!

177
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:23,292
One.

178
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,957
Take this crap back.

179
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:26,614
Two.

180
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:27,851
I've had it with you China-man!

181
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,705
Pay!

182
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,581
Hey! Hey! Easy there China-man!

183
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,620
One! Two! One! Two!

184
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,162
One! Two! One! Two!

185
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:03,239
One! Two! One! Two!

186
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:04,958
Stop!

187
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,911
Hey, my lady!

188
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,573
You are very pretty.

189
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,539
Give me a kiss!

190
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,250
What is that?

191
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,878
How dare you reject me woman!

192
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,950
Let's have a little chat over there,
in this dark alley...

193
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:36,374
Eva, you don't have to worry.

194
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,746
He is an Asian. Even if he goes for it,
you won't feel a thing.

195
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,740
What did you just say?

196
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:45,290
Let me show you something...
In my pants...

197
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,787
Hey addae! Brother!

198
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,910
What are you doing?

199
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:59,388
While you are sitting here enjoying adonko

200
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,665
while the ghan-arians are
demolishing our school.

201
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:07,578
What do you want, man?

202
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,369
Can't you see I am busy?

203
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,574
What the hell happened to you anyway?

204
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:17,203
The ghan-arians have come to our school.

205
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,285
It is terrible.

206
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:27,329
They say if we don't pay them a tribute
every month to the Japanese emperor,

207
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,290
they will exterminate us.

208
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,286
Why don't you stop them?

209
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:38,032
Isn't master there?

210
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,833
And your kung fu is very great too.

211
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,118
What's happening?

212
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,493
They are too good.

213
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,289
Too good?

214
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,583
Yes.

215
00:18:57,167 --> 00:19:01,831
So we need every man... we must stop them.

216
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,242
We must. We must go now. Please.

217
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,197
- You mean too good?
- We must go now.

218
00:20:23,417 --> 00:20:24,577
Stop right there!

219
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,748
No! Master!

220
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:23,702
You, devil!

221
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:26,792
You!

222
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,660
I'll kill you!

223
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:37,123
You show great fighting spirit.

224
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,375
You would be a good soldier for the
emperor. But... you need to be punished.

225
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,532
Master!

226
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:07,748
We have gathered here today to pay our
last respect to our dear master.

227
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:12,990
We fought a good fight in order
to save his nation.

228
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:19,283
So we gathered here to show our
appreciation for being a good master.

229
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:23,872
For it is written,
that a master dies by example.

230
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,665
And our master was really de man.

231
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,245
The lord gave and the lord has taken away.

232
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:43,329
For as much as we praise almighty god,

233
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:47,455
of his great mercy to take onto himself

234
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:54,864
the soul of dear master,
shadow snake master, the departed one.

235
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,032
Earth to the earth.

236
00:23:57,917 --> 00:23:59,453
Ashes to the ashes.

237
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,331
And dust to the dust.

238
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,995
Be with earth now and forever more. Amen.

239
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:26,199
Just take it easy. Right?

240
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,661
Where is Eva?

241
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,824
I haven't seen her. Where is she?

242
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,660
I don't know.

243
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,410
Why don't you...

244
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:49,370
I couldn't get hold of her for
the last few days.

245
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:53,660
I guess, our wedding plans are on ice now.

246
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,285
Sorry.

247
00:25:20,292 --> 00:25:23,659
Our master used to drive this type of car.

248
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,990
It breaks my heart.

249
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:28,741
These bastards will have to pay.

250
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:44,864
Will you still take part in the
ghan-arians' martial arts tournament?

251
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:46,873
Yes, I will.

252
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,660
That will be suicide.

253
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,039
I heard it is to the death.

254
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:58,829
The Japanese karate is too strong.

255
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:05,530
Our shadow snake kung fu style
won't stand a chance.

256
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:08,073
I know, addae.

257
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,198
But I have to try.

258
00:26:12,792 --> 00:26:14,953
I owe that to our master.

259
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:19,414
My heart...

260
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:23,874
My heart is burning addae!

261
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:38,576
Join the ghan-arians. Accra - kaputt!

262
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:42,454
Stalingrad - cheese wheel.

263
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:45,332
Final victory is imminent.

264
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:50,411
Join the ghan-arians. Kumasi - kaputt!

265
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:54,158
Stalingrad - Ferris wheel.

266
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,162
Give us four years time.

267
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,039
Hello!

268
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:04,124
I am buying the rice, as usual.

269
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:06,539
Just one cup.

270
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:03,618
Dj Adolf. Join the ghan-arians.

271
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:07,743
Greetings fighters from around the world.

272
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:11,705
Enlist to the great ghan-Arian tournament.

273
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:15,913
Get rewarded from Hitler himself.

274
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:20,201
Make your wishes become reality.

275
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:24,330
Hitler makes your wish come true.

276
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:27,829
Join the ghan-arians.

277
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,199
A warm welcome to all fighters
from around the world,

278
00:28:33,542 --> 00:28:36,542
if you win our tournament, Hitler will
Grant you a wish, whatever it may be.

279
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,707
Now a few words from our
beloved fuehrerin.

280
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,574
Be hard as a greyhound doggy.

281
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:00,953
Tough as a krupp iron bar.

282
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:04,204
And fast as...

283
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,578
Beef. I

284
00:29:08,542 --> 00:29:13,036
the next song shall be dedicated
to my new love...

285
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:16,079
Eva braun.

286
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:18,823
A tanned version.

287
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,037
Three times si-ka for Eva braun,
the tanned version!

288
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:39,655
- Si!
- Ka!

289
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:26,282
You guys are still alive.

290
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:29,783
You are here to enlist into our tournament?

291
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:33,167
You shall see.

292
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:35,785
Let me tell you something.

293
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,741
Your shadow snake style is useless.

294
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:48,042
Leave him.

295
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:49,958
Leave him!

296
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:19,285
Now come and fight.

297
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Hey!

298
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,750
Stop!

299
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:25,792
Who are you?

300
00:32:26,417 --> 00:32:29,614
You want to kill this little boy?

301
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:31,452
I said who are you?

302
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,707
I am a drinking master.

303
00:32:37,542 --> 00:32:38,748
Addae!

304
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,831
Come on, boy.

305
00:33:18,917 --> 00:33:20,248
Coward, come on.

306
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,414
I said come on.

307
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,243
We shall meet again.

308
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:29,542
And you!

309
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,039
Meet me there.

310
00:33:33,292 --> 00:33:34,873
Only the strong can survive.

311
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,197
Next time when you see a drinking master,

312
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:46,244
you will pass by.

313
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,198
Rise and shine.

314
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,119
Where am I?

315
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,365
Old guy...?

316
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,366
You're welcome to my home.

317
00:34:57,042 --> 00:34:58,373
Thank you for yesterday.

318
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:00,914
You saved my life.

319
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,786
Who are you, old guy?

320
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:12,123
Master akpeteshie.

321
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:15,907
Because...

322
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,245
I like akpeteshie.

323
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:28,833
Master akpeteshie.

324
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:33,662
Your style. It's fantastic.

325
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:38,280
You could hold your own against
these ghan-arians and their karate.

326
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:41,458
Please.

327
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:43,248
Master. Teach me.

328
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,073
Please.

329
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:56,083
Well, that depends on you.

330
00:35:56,708 --> 00:36:02,032
I can see a fire burning in your heart.

331
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:05,875
But is your heart in the right spot?

332
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:09,866
The training will be hard.

333
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:13,655
And I expect iron discipline.

334
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:17,409
If you oversleep or complain,

335
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:18,831
I will throw you out.

336
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:26,121
This will be harder than anything
you have ever experienced before.

337
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:28,081
Are you ready now?

338
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:29,583
Yes, master.

339
00:36:30,333 --> 00:36:31,698
I will not disappoint you.

340
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,706
Let's begin.

341
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:38,450
I call it, the moon shine style.

342
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:41,454
Here, drink this.

343
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:46,417
Take it.

344
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:54,167
Take it.

345
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:06,580
This is my secret, akpeteshie.

346
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:08,625
Watch me.

347
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,204
I think you are ready now to move on.

348
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:01,328
What do you mean by move on, master?

349
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,367
Move on to learn the next techniques.

350
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:09,408
What techniques, master?

351
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:17,038
Well, you can't win the tournament
just with the moon shine style.

352
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:20,245
It works against karate.

353
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:25,873
But not against goering's iron shirt style.

354
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,206
You have to move on.

355
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:30,867
You have to look for three-finger-Joe.

356
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:37,454
He lives on the hill of the dead,
there you will find three-finger-Joe.

357
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,286
My, my name is addae.

358
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:29,120
Master akpeteshie sent me.

359
00:40:29,917 --> 00:40:34,707
He said you can train me for the great

A man with three fingers will

Good.

383
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:50,699
But there is one more step.

384
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:53,661
You have to go to the priestess.

385
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:59,415
She will teach you how to break
the spell of the blood flag.

00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:03,416
But, how can I find the priestess?

387
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,368
Don't worry.

Wake up.

397
00:46:38,708 --> 00:46:39,993
Are you the priestess?

398
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,911
Yes, chosen one.

399
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:45,125

00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Come.

You hungry? I'm still a
bit hungey honestly.

404
00:47:14,917 --> 00:47:16,248
Don't have anything here.

405
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,789
Sorry, ate it all earlier.

406
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:19,490
Want some tea?

407
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:21,452
The pancakes are gone.

408
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:23,559
Oh yeah, what about that Adolf
guy by the way? Adolf himmler?

409
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:26,541
What is it with you and that
himmler guy? I mean Hitler.

410
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:35,535
He brainwashes people with a spell
of the so called blood flag... hold on.

411
00:47:35,917 --> 00:47:38,954
I will teach you a spell to break
the spell of the blood flag.

412
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Hold on a sec...

413
00:47:48,917 --> 00:47:53,581
This spell will protect you
from the blood flag.

414
00:47:53,833 --> 00:47:54,993
Take this.

415
00:48:01,542 --> 00:48:02,542

will break the spell of
the dreaded blood flag.

And eliminate the power Hitler
has over the ghan-arians.

You are ready now, chosen one.

421
00:48:35,417 --> 00:48:41,413
Meditate now... and never forget the words
I just told you!

Exterminate Hitler!

00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:37,748
You are Mr. machismo.

01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:15,655
Splendid Dr. adonko-man!

470
01:00:16,208 --> 01:00:19,996
We may have lost one of
our ghan-Arian comrades...

471
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:25,782
But now the shadow snake fools
have to kill each other.

472
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,580
Hey, brother.

473
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,121
I believe the next fight
is very easy for us.

474
01:00:39,292 --> 01:00:40,292
You, okay?

475
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:43,367
- Certainly!
- Cheers.

476
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:56,208
Sorry.

477
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:08,448
Addae, it looks like we have
to fight each other next.

478
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:14,823
I just don't know if I can.

479
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,490
We must, akante.

480
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:19,577
We must.

481
01:01:20,417 --> 01:01:22,373
We have to avenge our master's death.

482
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:25,699
We are the only chance these people have.

483
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:30,206
To get rid of this cancer,
that are the ghan-arians.

484
01:01:31,417 --> 01:01:32,623
You are right.

485
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:36,036
But I just can't.

486
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,788
You know, we have to fight to the death.

487
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:44,623
If we are there,

488
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:47,373
just make it quick.

489
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,539
Fight!

490
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:13,782
I don't know if I should kill
you or marry you.

491
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:19,281
Well, I guess I will kill you.

492
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:15,035
Winner: Reichsmarschall goering.

493
01:04:32,792 --> 01:04:33,952
Fight!

494
01:04:50,167 --> 01:04:52,283
I wish it would have never come to that.

495
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,956
We have to do what has to be done.

496
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,115
May the best man win.

497
01:05:23,042 --> 01:05:25,499
Why are you not fighting, addae?

498
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:29,578
This is not helping anyone.

499
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:33,161
You must not hold back.

500
01:05:35,792 --> 01:05:37,282
You have to fight.

501
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:40,458
Addae.

502
01:05:42,292 --> 01:05:45,534
I believe one of us can win the finals.

503
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:49,330
So let's do this for the
sake of our master.

504
01:05:50,208 --> 01:05:52,415
Do it for the sake of our town.

505
01:05:57,208 --> 01:05:58,948
- I just can't.
- Addae!

506
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,500
Start fighting!

507
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I can't.

508
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:54,618
I can't kill you.

509
01:07:56,833 --> 01:07:58,198
You're my friend!

510
01:07:58,667 --> 01:07:59,782
My brother!

511
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,448
I can't kill you...

512
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:05,239
Winner: Addae.

513
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:46,831
Eva.

514
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,115
Eva, wait.

515
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,411
It's me, addae.

516
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,787
My name is Eva, the tanned one,
have we met before?

517
01:09:57,917 --> 01:09:59,032
Have we met before?

518
01:10:00,167 --> 01:10:01,202
Of course, we have.

519
01:10:03,167 --> 01:10:04,452
Eva, I love you.

520
01:10:04,958 --> 01:10:06,289
Don't you remember?

521
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:14,537
Excuse me, I started feeling sick
when you said the name... just Eva.

522
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:20,997
Eval

523
01:10:24,417 --> 01:10:25,827
I love you...

524
01:11:01,458 --> 01:11:06,202
In then blue corner:

525
01:11:07,167 --> 01:11:12,992
Addae.

526
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:20,531
In the red corner:

527
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:28,781
Reichsashamona goering.

528
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:36,542
Fight!

529
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:25,369
Everybody has a plan.

530
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:28,369
Until you get hit.

531
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:33,702
I told you.
Your shadow snake style is useless.

532
01:12:34,292 --> 01:12:38,831
Now, prepare to be re-united
with your friend.

533
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:20,833
Break the nut!

534
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:44,996
Congratulations.
But unfortunately, due to a slight...

535
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:51,490
Rules violation, the last fight shall
be counted as a draw.

536
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:56,371
But, you are not the winner just yet!

537
01:13:56,625 --> 01:13:57,705
Tojo!

538
01:14:03,208 --> 01:14:10,410
How can you call yourself the winner if
you haven't beaten our best man just yet?

539
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:16,624
In him burns the flame
of the beauty of Japan!

540
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:22,039
Jawoll! I challenge you to a fight!

541
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:25,783
You're not the real winner of this
tournament without beating me!

542
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,582
Do you accept?

543
01:14:29,292 --> 01:14:30,372
I accept!

544
01:14:31,042 --> 01:14:32,873
So shall be it!

545
01:14:33,167 --> 01:14:37,991
The final fight should be
hideki tojo of the ghan-arians

546
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:44,704
versus addae of the shadow snake school.

547
01:14:45,625 --> 01:14:48,867
Gentleman! Get ready to fight!

548
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:52,825
Boys! Take the body away!

549
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:50,155
Dr. Hitler, how would you like me
to exterminate him?

550
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:55,697
This is my secret, akpeteshie.

551
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:00,206
No! Master!

552
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:03,577
Eva, I love you!

553
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,786
Trying to numb your pain?

554
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:35,539
I'll show you pain!

555
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:38,625
Come on!

556
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:22,198
I won the tournament.

557
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:26,371
Now I want you to Grant me my wish.

558
01:17:28,042 --> 01:17:30,909
So, what shall your wish be?

559
01:17:31,708 --> 01:17:34,905
Shall it be women? Shall it be money?

560
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:41,408
I can even make you my new
no.2 if you want.

561
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,410
I don't want any of them.

562
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:46,448
I want the blood flag.

563
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:50,405
What? The blutfahne?

564
01:17:51,042 --> 01:17:56,491
A different choice would be
preferable, indeed.

565
01:17:56,667 --> 01:17:59,989
Now we gonna burn
dat dayum blood flag.

566
01:18:01,125 --> 01:18:04,913
No! Not the blood flag!

567
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:20,615
Addae, take it!

568
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:41,200
Welcome! Welcome to my shop!

569
01:20:53,333 --> 01:20:55,449
Are you doing great?

570
01:20:57,542 --> 01:20:59,518
I'm aight.
I'm glad we could bury the hatchet.

571
01:20:59,542 --> 01:21:01,578
- Tojo, we want some of this.
- Sure!

572
01:21:02,542 --> 01:21:03,702
Which do you want?

573
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:07,665
With or without teeth?

574
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:10,700
- 10 Ghana cedi.
- We want it.

575
01:21:25,542 --> 01:21:27,078
- Here you are.
- Thank you very much.

576
01:21:39,125 --> 01:21:43,243
Well, I guess my father was wrong

577
01:21:43,417 --> 01:21:45,999
and you are never a loser after all.

578
01:21:46,292 --> 01:21:48,248
Yeah, I am not a loser.

579
01:21:49,958 --> 01:21:53,121
And I am really glad everything is
back to normal.

580
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:58,744
Once we settle down,
I will open my own kung fu school.

581
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:03,907
I will strongly support you, because your
kung fu has saved us all!

582
01:22:04,583 --> 01:22:07,780
Something like the ghan-arians must
never happen again.

583
01:22:08,792 --> 01:22:09,952
Hey addae...

584
01:22:10,917 --> 01:22:12,327
- Si!
- Ka!
