Good morning.

4
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:07,874
What's this about?

5
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:16,333
What do you mean?

6
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:20,749
You left this on the pillow right
next to my head.

7
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:26,916
No, I didn't. Why on earth would
I do such a thing?

8
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:29,166
Penelope.

9
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:31,708
Who you think else would have done it?

10
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:38,291
I don't know. Things
just happen sometimes.

11
00:01:39,624 --> 00:01:41,749
A ghost didn't put this by
my head to kill me.

12
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:44,533
I could've poke my eye right

13
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:45,517

15
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:51,291

17
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,499
I don't know.

18
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:03,241
Maybe some ghost did it,

19
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,583
putting it there to warn you.

20
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:08,449
The creeper is you.

21
00:02:08,499 --> 00:02:10,283
I done seen you lurk
around these halls.

22
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,166

23
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:17,041
Don't be silly.

24
00:02:17,124 --> 00:02:19,491
The truth is being told to you.

25
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,949
Alright, now you up

26
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:23,708
up in the midnight hour.

27
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,999
And now it looks like you
trying to kill me in my sleep!

28
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:29,291
Don't be silly.

29
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,699
Ain't nothing silly about me woman.

30

31
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,824
I don't remember doing anything.

32
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:54,874
I truly don't.

33
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,124
That's the problem.

34
00:02:56,916 --> 00:02:58,033
Now, Hailey Lynn

35
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,741
could have gotten hurt.

36
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:00,791
Then what?

37
00:03:01,499 --> 00:03:02,699
You know good and well,

38
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:04,783
I would never hurt my kids.

39
00:03:04,833 --> 00:03:05,809
Not intentionally.

40
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:07,916
But what if you did?

41
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:12,208
What if that knife was in her
room and not ours?

42
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,666
You're right.

43
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,624
I don't know what's happening
to me.

44
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,782
I'm sure they got some kind of

45
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:30,616
treatment for sleepwalking.

46
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:31,666
You know.

47
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:33,782
Who is they?

48
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:35,707
They-The doctors.

49
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:38,241
Maybe some kind of underlying
illness

50
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:39,782
that we just don't know about.

51
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:40,832

00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:46,999
Can't hurt, can it?

55
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:51,541
I don't think so.

56
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:56,124
It's not that serious.

57
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:59,541
The evaluation wouldn't
take longer than a couple days.

58
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:01,791
A few at the most.

59
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:09,749
Valuation!

60
00:04:10,707 --> 00:04:12,957
What kind of doctor
are you talking about!

61
00:04:13,207 --> 00:04:15,832
The kind that'll help
get your mind right!

62
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:18,499
You want me to admit myself?

63
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:21,366
I'm not crazy, Jasper.

64
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,457
I didn't say you were alright.

65
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:26,291
It's just to find out what's
wrong.

66

Don't you wanna know
what's wrong with you?

67
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,041
Maybe I don't.

68

I believe so.

71
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:46,624
You don't sound too
sure about that.

78

I'm not comfortable
talking about this.

00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:45,373
Uh...

184
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:48,498
Yeah!
I got to tell you something.

185
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:50,540
What!

186
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,665
I'm making their favorite
peanut butter sandwiches.

187
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:55,873
Yeah.

188
00:13:58,373 --> 00:13:59,915
Where are the kids.

189
00:14:00,665 --> 00:14:02,290
Abo-about that, um.

190
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:04,956
They've gone, honey.

191
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:08,206
Gone where?

192
00:14:10,623 --> 00:14:11,698
What did you do to them?

193
00:14:11,748 --> 00:14:12,873
Not nothing.

194
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,040
Not a thing, I swear.

195
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,998
Where are my kids, Jasper?

196
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:29,040
I'm so sorry, baby.

197
00:14:30,206 --> 00:14:33,040
There was nothing I could do.

198
00:14:35,706 --> 00:14:37,206
What are you saying?

199
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:41,331
Zoey and Paige they are-
They're gone.

200
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:45,831
The woods took my munchkins away
and they...

201
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:48,290
And they ain't coming back.

202
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,498
See, I knew you would figure it out.

203
00:14:54,665 --> 00:14:57,206
You didn't watch them.

204
00:14:57,665 --> 00:14:59,531
You knew they shouldn't go in those woods,

205
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:02,331
And you left them alone anyways.

206
00:15:05,123 --> 00:15:08,498
So tell me what were you doing
in a psych ward?

207
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:13,581
Counting down the days
until you'd come and get me.

208
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,665
Those days turned into months,

209
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:21,873
even years that never seemed to end.

210
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:30,331
You done gone and turned into
a heifer on me, huh?

211
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,099
Because the way I see it,

212
00:15:32,123 --> 00:15:35,748
you've been waiting and planning for a day
such as this to strike this blow on me.

213
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,406
You don't even know
what a heifer is.

214
00:15:40,456 --> 00:15:41,456
That don't matter.

215
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,331
Every–thing mat–ters!

216
00:15:45,123 --> 00:15:46,206
Did you do it?

217
00:15:50,331 --> 00:15:51,790
It sure looks that way, doesn't it?

218
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:53,831
Ain't that about a blimp!

219
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,698
I can't seem to apologize enough
for you to get it.

220
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:00,865
Ain't a darn thing I can do
about that now, Penelope.

221
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:03,331
I can't change the past.

222
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:07,956
You're not sorry.
You're pitiful!

223
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:10,790
And I can't stand your presence near me.

224
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:12,790
Not!
Wait, hold on now.

225
00:16:13,748 --> 00:16:15,831
Don't say such a thing.

226
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:19,831
Harmful words coming out
your mouth, woman.

227
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:27,040
I know.
But I do.

228
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:35,998
Okay, just he-hear me please,
please hear me clearly now.

229
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,331
I took my eyes off of them
for one moment, and that's it.

230
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:42,432
They were out here
playing around and everything.

231
00:16:42,456 --> 00:16:44,206
I Just-I let them be.

232
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,706
Why would you think they
wouldn't go into those woods?

233
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,206
They were kids, curious to know
what was in there.

234
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,248
I wasn't thinking.

235
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,206
No, you weren't.

236
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:02,373
Our little ones are gone,
Jasper.

237
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,573
Yeah, I know, I know.

238
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:08,165
You know, I ain't wont harm
to come to them kids.

239
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:10,540
You left them alone.

240
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:11,865
And I...

241
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:13,698
I, went in there straight away
after them.

242
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:15,123
And...

243
00:17:15,498 --> 00:17:17,540
Everything just got silent on
me.

244
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:19,865
Complete silence swept the air.

245
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,489
And they were gone with it.

246
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:25,289
It's nothing I could do.

247
00:17:25,623 --> 00:17:26,623
Silent!

248
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:31,081
I told you something was in
there.

249
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:32,248
And!

250
00:17:32,623 --> 00:17:36,248
Stop pretending, the darkness
isn't real!

251
00:17:38,414 --> 00:17:41,323
You were there with me, Jasper.

252
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:43,789
I know you felt it too.

253
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:48,206
Why didn't you believe me?

254
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:55,164
You don't think I feel guilty?

255
00:17:56,331 --> 00:17:57,614
I search for them kids.

256
00:17:57,664 --> 00:17:59,664
I searched for Zoe and Paige.

257
00:17:59,706 --> 00:18:02,623
I couldn't find them anywhere.
They were gone without a trace.

258
00:18:03,956 --> 00:18:07,206
But you wanted me to forget
about them. Why?

259
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,206
Just what had to be done.

260
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:17,539
It was my blood that ran
through their veins.

261
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:19,289
Not yours alone!

262
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:22,123
I know you don't understand it.

263
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:26,581
I know, but I tried to stop
the darkness from attacking you.

264
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:28,614
Really?
Yeah, really!

265
00:18:28,664 --> 00:18:30,198
I was protecting you.

266
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:31,331
Just stop!

267
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:39,081
You didn't allow me a day to
mourn for them. Not one!

268
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:43,498
Ya just gotta let the dead lie.

269
00:18:45,456 --> 00:18:49,289
That darkness will creep up on ya
and ya won't know it until it's too late.

270
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:52,789
Now I'm letting you know
it won't let you go.

271
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:58,531
You had me... walk around

272
00:18:58,581 --> 00:19:01,914
as if they never existed.

273
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:06,206
And like a fool, I did it to
appease you!

274
00:19:07,123 --> 00:19:08,823
Who does that?

275
00:19:08,873 --> 00:19:11,414
Those were your children, too!

276
00:19:11,873 --> 00:19:13,623
You don't think I love my kids?

277
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:16,823
I don't know, Jasper.

278
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:20,456
How could you forget
about them so quickly?

279
00:19:20,581 --> 00:19:22,581
I thought we were over this.

280
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:39,864
In my subconscious.

281
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:41,998
I walked in my sleep.

282
00:19:44,956 --> 00:19:48,289
I searched in the dark shadows
for those ghosts.

283
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:52,789
And you locked me up
with the insane for it.

284
00:19:53,623 --> 00:19:55,123
You needed help.

285
00:19:55,248 --> 00:19:57,706
I needed comfort.

286
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:01,248
Something you never gave.

287
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:04,248
You like a zombie

288
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:07,998
Roaming around in the darkness
just disappearing in the midnight hours.

289
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:13,781
What else was I supposed to do?

290
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:17,748
Penelope you'd be gone
for hours and sometimes days?

291
00:20:18,664 --> 00:20:20,364
Nobody even knew where you were.

292
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:22,456
You were losing your
raggedy mind up in this house.

293
00:20:26,623 --> 00:20:30,373
You left me there, and forgot
about me.

294
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:35,414
I didn't see or hear from you
for years.

295
00:20:36,748 --> 00:20:40,539
Not 1 or 2 but 5 years!

296
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:45,776
I just couldn't see you like
that.

297
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,122
Your light had dimmed.

298
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:54,622
Like you were fading away on me.

299
00:20:55,414 --> 00:20:57,872
My children were my sunshine.

300
00:21:04,081 --> 00:21:05,664
My light...

301
00:21:07,497 --> 00:21:08,497
My life...

302
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:14,331
You took that from me!

303
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:24,364
And I needed-
Needed time to refocus.

304
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:27,331
You, you needed to be fixed.

305
00:21:28,206 --> 00:21:31,206
You needed to get a grip on life
so your light could shine again.

306
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,536
I couldn't do that for you.

307
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:40,039
You took my family away from me.

308
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:46,664
What did you think a piece of cake
was supposed to make everything better.

309
00:21:47,497 --> 00:21:50,372
Make everything okay?

310
00:21:50,497 --> 00:21:52,539
Yeah, I sure did.

311
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:56,789
I did.
It's just the way it had to be.

312
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:01,456
Have you full of happy thoughts.

313
00:22:02,706 --> 00:22:05,706
Let go of the pass Penelope.

314
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:20,414
Oh, you're right. You're right.

315
00:22:20,914 --> 00:22:25,581
You're right. I will forget
about the past.

316
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:28,956
And all that garbage
out of your mouth with it.

317
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:32,539
I don't believe in divorce.

318
00:22:34,164 --> 00:22:37,206
I'm not interested in what you believe.

319
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:40,872
How much more am I to take?

320
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,956
What am I supposed to do?

321
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,622
Forgive me as many times as
it takes.

322
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:01,664
I'm not a saint!
This can't be fixed!

323
00:23:01,956 --> 00:23:04,164
I will never forgive you for this.

324
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:05,956
Look ah here!

325
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,747
I made a covenant with God,

326
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:12,817
and this right here ain't
something for you to be breaking.

327
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:16,581
Don't bring God into this.
Why not?

328
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,456
I made a covenant with Him.

329
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:22,739
You and I stood in front of God
and we told him,

330
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:24,831
till death do us part
and you ain't dead yet.

331
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:29,122
I will not divorce you women.

332
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:32,739
For better or for worse.

333
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:34,497
You remember that, don't you?

334
00:23:40,914 --> 00:23:43,456
I need my space.

335
00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:48,081
Take your things and leave.

336
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:08,872
Head on onto the other property
a little bit.

337
00:24:09,914 --> 00:24:11,539
I won't be gone long.

338
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,956
I'll be back real soon, you
know.

339
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,539
So don't you get too comfortable
living without me!

340
00:24:59,997 --> 00:25:02,289
Are you alright, sweetie?

341
00:25:04,747 --> 00:25:07,080
You don't see them mommy?

342
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:10,872
See who?

343
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:17,080
They're talking to me.

344
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:25,747
I don't see anyone.

345
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,190
What y'all falling behind like
a couple of lost puppies for?

346
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,080
Bring yourselves up here,
I want to show you something.

347
00:26:04,705 --> 00:26:05,705
All of this...

348
00:26:06,455 --> 00:26:07,455
Is wealth...

349
00:26:07,705 --> 00:26:10,080
In the palm of your hands.

350
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:14,030
Man, Uncle Jasper.

351
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,530
I knew you had land, but...

352
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,989
I'd know you had all this.

353
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,789
Naw, this ain't even half of it.

354
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:25,372
You know, one day I'm the big
belly up floating around in that blue sky,

355
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:28,039
watching over y'all.

356
00:26:29,497 --> 00:26:30,739
Don't say that.

357
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,664
Awl it's true young fellow,
it's true.

358
00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:36,164
Everybody ends up
pushing up daisies at some point.

359
00:26:38,414 --> 00:26:41,447
My petals might be dropping
sooner than later.

360
00:26:41,497 --> 00:26:44,205
But when that day comes,

361
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,997
all this belong to y'all.

362
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
All of it?

363
00:26:52,455 --> 00:26:53,455
That's right.

364
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:55,830
Split between both of you.

365
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,872
Hum.

366
00:26:57,705 --> 00:27:00,622
I don't know what to do with
all this.

367
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,664
Whatever you do, can't sell it.

368
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,997
Alright.
Keep this in the family.

369
00:27:18,747 --> 00:27:20,789
Hold on, hold on.

370
00:27:21,247 --> 00:27:22,664
Something ain't right here.

371
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,247
I don't hear no birds chirping,
no critters moving around.

372
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:32,545
Alright don't move.
Y'all just stay right here.

373
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:12,122
Run!

374
00:28:16,747 --> 00:28:18,822
You ran out of there
like a bat out of hell.

375
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:20,264
I didn't think you had it in you
to run like that.

376
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:23,056
Ain't no time to be dilly-dallying around
when it's time hightail out of dodge.

377
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,764
You hear me?

378
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:24,788
Yeah...

379
00:28:25,997 --> 00:28:27,357
Well, now that Caleb's not around.

380
00:28:28,872 --> 00:28:30,372
What was back there?

381
00:28:30,955 --> 00:28:33,555
I just know I am about to be
the one getting snatched up just yet.

382
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:34,913
Snatched up!

383
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:36,538
By what?

384
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,322
You need to mind your business.

385
00:28:38,372 --> 00:28:39,788
Alright now.

386
00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:43,080
Sometimes you need to know
when to shut up.

387
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:44,598
But Jasper, what's with the secrets.

388
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,205
Secrets ain't meant to be told?

389
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,738
So stop asking.

390
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:49,155
So that's the best answer
you got.

391
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:50,497
That's the one I'm giving.

392
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:53,098
Now I just saved your life back
there boy, you better be grateful.

393
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:54,056
Really?

394
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,488
From running from a ghost.

395
00:28:55,538 --> 00:28:57,655
You ask too many questions.

396
00:28:57,705 --> 00:29:00,497
Look, what I see is
somebody who has secrets.

397
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,405
And I want to know what for.

398
00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:04,738
So what was back there in
those woods of yours.

399
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:05,473
That's another question.

400
00:29:05,497 --> 00:29:06,977
I'm uh have a drink, you want
a drink?

401
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,080
Just what I need to quench my
thirst.

402
00:29:33,747 --> 00:29:35,455
So are you going to answer my
question?

403
00:29:36,413 --> 00:29:38,573
Do I look like somebody
who would answer your question?

404
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,431
You know I think it's time
for you to leave.

405
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:42,223
No!

406
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,738
Not until I have answers.

407
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:45,747
Oh, okay.

408
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:48,813
Look who has grown themselves
a pair of balls over the years.

409
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:51,580
What do you think,
you can challenge me, boy.

410
00:29:51,788 --> 00:29:54,308
You know you ain't so grown where
I can put you in a grave, now.

411
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,663
You know...

412
00:29:58,788 --> 00:30:00,122
I'm not a little kid anymore.

413
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:02,913
Okay.
So what you plan on doing?

414
00:30:03,622 --> 00:30:04,681
You better stand down, boy.

415
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:05,913
Before you get yourself hurt.

416
00:30:06,455 --> 00:30:08,135
I'm the wrong one
to be playing games with.

417
00:30:13,497 --> 00:30:15,113
Now that you quiet.

418
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:16,580
Let me tell you something.

419
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:20,530
If you pay attention to that
forest,

420
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,580
it'll speak to you.

421
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,931
You know them critters in there
they ain't silent for nothing.

422
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:27,595
They usually the first ones to
know something ain't right in there.

423
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,988
Now if you don't pay attention

424
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:33,705
to the signs before you go in
there, you may not make it out alive.

425
00:30:36,747 --> 00:30:38,863
So is that what happened to
my sisters?

426
00:30:38,913 --> 00:30:40,288
What do you mean by that boy?

427
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,863
They just went into the woods.

428
00:30:42,913 --> 00:30:45,747
Never to be found again, didn't they?

429
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:48,038
Yeah, that's right.

430
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:51,455
All those little cubs left
the field of Lillies...

431
00:30:51,997 --> 00:30:53,348
got stanched-up by that there forest.

432
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:55,163
Never to be seen again.

433
00:30:55,413 --> 00:30:58,363
Jasper, how can you be so
cavalier about it?

434
00:30:58,413 --> 00:31:00,030
I can't change the past boy.

435
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,072
What is, is!
And that's it.

436
00:31:02,122 --> 00:31:04,572
Yeah, but you sure can learn from it.

437
00:31:04,622 --> 00:31:07,080
I'd be a fool if I harped
over something I couldn't change.

438
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:09,205
And you know I ain't
nobody's fool.

439
00:31:09,538 --> 00:31:13,155
I'm plumb tired now.
It's time for you to be leaving.

440
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,905
Gone get the stepping off my property, boy?

441
00:31:15,955 --> 00:31:17,280
What about Paige and Zoe?

442
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,746
What about them?

443
00:31:18,996 --> 00:31:21,496
Isn't there more to the story?

444
00:31:22,913 --> 00:31:23,913
Look they gone...

445
00:31:24,788 --> 00:31:26,446
Alright, they ain't coming back.

446
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:27,538
So you say.

447
00:31:33,913 --> 00:31:35,993
I'm going to find out what's in
those woods of yours.

448
00:31:36,246 --> 00:31:37,246
One way or another!

449
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:40,455
You a fool one way or another.

450
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:50,038
Hey, Hailey.

451
00:32:02,455 --> 00:32:03,455
Are you okay?

452
00:32:04,663 --> 00:32:05,913
Where's Mom at?

453
00:32:09,455 --> 00:32:10,455
She's in the basement,

454
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:12,913
washing clothes.

455
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:15,580
Well I have to talk to her.

456
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,538
Can I have some?

457
00:32:17,913 --> 00:32:19,496
You want some of this?

458
00:32:21,163 --> 00:32:22,163
You can have it.

459
00:32:26,621 --> 00:32:28,163
You say she's downstairs.

460
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:36,038
Close your eyes...

461
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,830
I want to show you something.

462
00:32:49,996 --> 00:32:51,246
You can open your eyes now.

463
00:32:58,455 --> 00:33:00,663
What am I supposed to see?

464
00:33:02,705 --> 00:33:04,205
You don't see them.

465
00:33:05,705 --> 00:33:07,913
Looks like your imaginary friend
is only for you to see.

466
00:33:08,788 --> 00:33:10,788
I'm not pretending.

467
00:33:13,746 --> 00:33:16,113
You really see something?

468
00:33:16,163 --> 00:33:18,330
Why can't the bigger people
see like I do?

469
00:33:19,996 --> 00:33:20,996
I don't know.

470
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:27,788
They told me to tell you,

471
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:30,580
they'll be talking to you soon too.

472
00:33:31,955 --> 00:33:33,705
They want to talk to me.

473
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:44,580
Mom!
Hayden's here.

474
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:03,038
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

475
00:34:04,705 --> 00:34:06,038
What brings you here?

476
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:07,946
What, I can't visit

477
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:10,788
the best woman in the world to me.

478
00:34:16,705 --> 00:34:17,830
The hat.
Thank you.

479
00:34:19,455 --> 00:34:21,205
Now you know you're always
welcome here.

480
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:24,705
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
Listen, Ma.

481
00:34:25,788 --> 00:34:28,496
I wanted to talk to you about
something.

482
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:30,080
What is it?

483
00:34:34,288 --> 00:34:35,014
Oh!
So we're serious.

484
00:34:35,038 --> 00:34:37,163
Okay. Yeah. Let's be serious.

485
00:34:37,288 --> 00:34:38,871
Um...

486
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:41,326
Do you know what's in the woods
of Jasper's property?

487
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:53,204
Why are you asking me about that?

488
00:34:54,704 --> 00:34:56,413
You know something, don't you?

489
00:34:56,954 --> 00:34:59,288
Now, before you answer, don't lie.

490
00:35:00,538 --> 00:35:02,371
I can see it on your face.

491
00:35:15,954 --> 00:35:17,996
Don't go in those woods.

492
00:35:18,454 --> 00:35:19,454
It's not safe.

493
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:22,246
Why?

494
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:24,204
What's in there, Mom?

495
00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:31,579
Darkness.

496
00:35:35,246 --> 00:35:38,204
What do you mean, darkness, Ma?

497
00:35:48,954 --> 00:35:52,371
It's something you can feel...

498
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,954
but can't touch.

499
00:36:00,246 --> 00:36:01,454
Smell...

500
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:03,954
but not see.

501
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,788
All I know is many have gone in
there, but few have come out.

502
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:14,514
Ma.

503
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:17,079
That's rather bizarre.
Are you sure?

504
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,246
It's the only way I know how
to explain it.

505
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,329
The darkness moves in silence.

506
00:36:33,996 --> 00:36:36,288
We live in a day of uncertainty.

507
00:36:39,663 --> 00:36:42,621
We don't know when we will
take our last breath.

508
00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:51,621
Why are you so serious?

509
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:56,579
Because, I don't want to
lose you too son!

510
00:36:59,746 --> 00:37:03,121
I've had enough heartbreak
to last me a lifetime.

511
00:37:03,246 --> 00:37:04,555
I've had enough heartbreak
to last me a lifetime.

512
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:07,038
Ma, look, I'm not going anywhere.

513
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:12,663
I know you Hayden.

514
00:37:14,954 --> 00:37:17,038
Once you've made up your mind,

515
00:37:18,246 --> 00:37:20,496
There no changing it.

516
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:22,204
Look Ma.

517
00:37:23,663 --> 00:37:25,529
Whatever I'm going to do,

518
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,913
I'll be sure to be careful.
Okay.

519
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:35,279
Don't let your feet lead you down

520
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:37,788
a path of sorrow and dreaded end.

521
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:40,204
Mom

522
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:41,750
Tell me...

523
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:47,371
Why are you so afraid of the
woods?

524
00:37:48,996 --> 00:37:51,871
Because I was in there when it
came.

525
00:37:53,454 --> 00:37:55,613
It chased me and Jasper out of
there.

526
00:37:55,663 --> 00:37:57,079
I never went back in there.

527
00:38:05,538 --> 00:38:07,954
Nothing is moving.

528
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,996
You thinks some spook is coming
to get you.

529
00:38:11,787 --> 00:38:13,121
Come on.

530
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:16,329
Don't worry your pretty little head about
this here little silence.

531
00:38:16,496 --> 00:38:17,704
You know I'll protect you.

532
00:38:18,246 --> 00:38:20,662
I'll never let any harm come
ta touch ya.

533
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:32,037
It feels like the air is
being sucked right

534
00:38:32,204 --> 00:38:34,029
out of my lungs.

535
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,996
Honey, I, I don't feel nothing.

536
00:38:36,162 --> 00:38:39,162
How can you not feel this?

537
00:38:39,746 --> 00:38:43,704
Oh. Oh. Something dark is in
here.

538
00:38:44,454 --> 00:38:47,121
And we are walking straight to it.

539
00:38:48,871 --> 00:38:50,954
It's getting hard for me to
breathe.

540
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:52,621
We have to leave.

541
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:53,912
Something is here!

542
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:56,329
We have to go now!

543
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:14,412
Jasper and I would walk
through there all the time.

544
00:39:17,037 --> 00:39:19,704
In fact, I loved it there.

545
00:39:23,162 --> 00:39:25,162
The beauty of it all intrigued
me.

546
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:28,871
Okay. And?

547
00:39:30,412 --> 00:39:32,829
There was a shift.

548
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:37,037
The atmosphere changed.

549
00:39:37,412 --> 00:39:40,662
He thought I was losing my mind
until he felt it too.

550
00:39:43,662 --> 00:39:45,246
But then want happened?

551
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:49,621
You couldn't see it.

552
00:39:49,912 --> 00:39:53,579
Invisible things lurk in the forest.

553
00:39:56,121 --> 00:39:59,779
And it moves in silence.

554
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:00,829
How do you know this?

555
00:40:05,454 --> 00:40:07,996
It's the only way I can
explain it to you, son.

556
00:40:09,787 --> 00:40:14,162
The animals even know when it
comes.

557
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:17,154
They stay still,

558
00:40:17,204 --> 00:40:18,662
not making a sound.

559
00:40:24,871 --> 00:40:25,871
So...

560
00:40:26,912 --> 00:40:28,621
let me get this straight.

561
00:40:29,704 --> 00:40:31,746
Nobody went in to find Paige
and Zoe,

562
00:40:32,704 --> 00:40:34,412
because of the invisible
things in there?

563
00:40:35,162 --> 00:40:36,162
No.

564
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:40,871
Bobby and Jasper searched.

565
00:40:42,746 --> 00:40:44,037
All I know

566
00:40:45,787 --> 00:40:47,912
is they were never seen again.

567
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:50,871
My babies were gone.

568
00:40:53,037 --> 00:40:54,037
Ma.

569
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:55,496
Don't cry.

570
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:58,287
It's Okay.

571
00:40:59,371 --> 00:41:01,662
I just miss them so much.

572
00:41:02,704 --> 00:41:06,454
Yeah.
Yeah, me too, me too.

573
00:41:11,621 --> 00:41:12,621
So, Ma.

574
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:16,162
What's that about?

575
00:41:16,704 --> 00:41:19,746
I'm just keeping my house clean.

576
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:22,662
From what?

577
00:41:25,412 --> 00:41:26,871
Spirits.

578
00:41:29,162 --> 00:41:30,162
Ma...

579
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:32,079
Spirits!

580
00:41:32,662 --> 00:41:34,496
Are you okay?

581
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:38,621
I'm just...

582
00:41:39,287 --> 00:41:42,495
trying to protect my little
Hailey Lynn.

583
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:47,704
Look, that sage ain't gonna
do nothing but smell up your house.

584
00:41:49,329 --> 00:41:51,013
What makes you think something
is after her anyway?

585
00:41:51,037 --> 00:41:52,120
I don't know!

586
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,579
But she said something is here.

587
00:41:57,912 --> 00:41:58,912
Yeah.

588
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,037
She said the same thing to me,
too.

589
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:05,049
I didn't really think
anything of it though.

590
00:42:05,787 --> 00:42:07,454
So why are you?

591
00:42:08,787 --> 00:42:11,162
Let's just say, I'm paying
attention.

592
00:42:12,995 --> 00:42:15,120
Listening to every sound.

593
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:19,412
Looking at every movement.

594
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,912
I can't help but wonder,

595
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:25,037
what is in here.

596
00:42:25,912 --> 00:42:26,912
Hold on.

597
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:31,029
So first you're telling me

598
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,029
something is in the woods,

599
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:34,454
and now something is in here.

600
00:42:35,662 --> 00:42:39,287
Mama, I don't really know
what to think about all this.

601
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,329
Why are you looking at me like that?

602
00:42:46,954 --> 00:42:48,737
You don't believe me, do you?

603
00:42:48,787 --> 00:42:51,620
I'm just listening.

604
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:53,912
Taking it in as you speak to me.

605
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:58,329
I'm not crazy for wanting
to protect my family.

606
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:01,329
Ma, I didn't say you were.
Don't be so defensive.

607
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:05,704
I will do whatever it takes
to protect my family.

608
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:09,154
To protect you.

609
00:43:09,204 --> 00:43:10,204
Ma,

610
00:43:10,412 --> 00:43:13,237
I just want to make sure that
you're okay.

611
00:43:13,287 --> 00:43:15,204
Why wouldn't I be?

612
00:43:15,787 --> 00:43:18,745
I mean, the sage is a little extreme Ma.

613
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:23,287
I just want to make sure that you're okay.

614
00:43:25,204 --> 00:43:29,704
I'm good.
I, I just don't know what else to do.

615
00:43:36,912 --> 00:43:38,579
Are you scared?

616
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:41,888
Maybe,

617
00:43:41,912 --> 00:43:42,912
just a little.

618
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,370
So...

619
00:43:45,287 --> 00:43:47,245
you really think ghost are in here.

620
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:49,829
Something is.

621
00:43:51,745 --> 00:43:52,865
Have you thought about...

622
00:43:54,204 --> 00:43:56,662
seeing a therapist again.

623
00:44:04,995 --> 00:44:06,037
No.

624
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:11,404
So, you think I'm losing my mind?

625
00:44:11,454 --> 00:44:13,695
Hey, look, I'm just trying to help.

626
00:44:13,745 --> 00:44:15,570
It worked for you last time.

627
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,495
Maybe it'll work again.

628
00:44:18,745 --> 00:44:19,745
I see.

629
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:23,829
Do you know what they did to
me, last time? -No.

630
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,495
Maybe if you would've a came to visit me,

631
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:29,329
then you would have known.

632
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:35,537
I try many times, okay.

633
00:44:35,745 --> 00:44:37,529
They wouldn't let me see you.

634
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:39,862
Jasper must have told them
not to let me in.

635
00:44:39,912 --> 00:44:40,912
My hands were tied.

636
00:44:42,037 --> 00:44:44,237
No, mine was!

637
00:44:44,287 --> 00:44:46,388
I didn't know what else to do,
but to wait till you came

638
00:44:46,412 --> 00:44:48,745
home. I'm sorry.

639
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:00,370
Don't blame yourself.

640
00:45:01,912 --> 00:45:04,529
It's not your burden to carry.

641
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:07,745
Yeah, but still.

642
00:45:09,203 --> 00:45:10,328
You were gone...

643
00:45:11,245 --> 00:45:12,245
And I hate that.

644
00:45:13,203 --> 00:45:15,787
And I hate him more for leaving you there.

645
00:45:19,495 --> 00:45:20,495
I just...

646
00:45:21,662 --> 00:45:23,912
I just wish that I could have done more.

647
00:45:27,245 --> 00:45:30,912
I see Jasper's trickery left me there,

648
00:45:32,078 --> 00:45:34,203
to be forgotten.

649
00:45:36,412 --> 00:45:39,120
Maybe it's best I didn't see you.

650
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:43,078
I think it would have torn my heart apart
to see you suffer and do nothing.

651
00:45:43,995 --> 00:45:46,703
Apparently nobody did.

652
00:45:50,245 --> 00:45:53,245
I was left alone in misery,

653
00:45:54,203 --> 00:45:56,412
fighting off demons.

654
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:00,487
Maybe it was the meds,

655
00:46:00,537 --> 00:46:02,495
had you hallucinating.

656
00:46:02,703 --> 00:46:04,412
None of it was real.

657
00:46:05,995 --> 00:46:10,578
I saw those demons when I got
there and they didn't leave.

658
00:46:17,162 --> 00:46:18,870
I was touched by a spirit.

659
00:46:25,703 --> 00:46:26,953
Spirit.

660
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:30,953
Something invisible was in my room.

661
00:46:33,662 --> 00:46:35,537
I heard it speak to me.

662
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:40,370
It had no face.

663
00:46:42,037 --> 00:46:44,620
No lips to speak.

664
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:48,495
It spoke to me in the spirit.

665
00:46:50,995 --> 00:46:52,828
I was sleep.

666
00:46:56,662 --> 00:46:57,703
And I felt,

667
00:46:59,203 --> 00:47:03,370
the bed dipped, as if a body
sunk down the mattress.

668
00:47:07,912 --> 00:47:09,578
Something...

669
00:47:10,203 --> 00:47:12,703
invisible was in my room.

670
00:47:17,162 --> 00:47:18,945
Are you telling me,

671
00:47:18,995 --> 00:47:21,203
ghosts came in your room.

672
00:47:23,078 --> 00:47:25,945
I'm going to recommend,

673
00:47:25,995 --> 00:47:28,578
that you do not tell Jasper.

674
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:30,245
Okay.

675
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:32,995
He might lock you up for good this time.

676
00:47:34,745 --> 00:47:37,453
I'm never going back to that place.

677
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:42,453
Hailey!

678
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:45,245
I'm about to go!

679
00:48:09,203 --> 00:48:10,287
Hailey...

680
00:48:27,495 --> 00:48:28,870
Hailey...

681
00:48:33,787 --> 00:48:34,787
Hailey!

682
00:48:39,036 --> 00:48:40,111
I'm scared, Mommy.

683
00:48:40,161 --> 00:48:42,161
Somethings in there.

684
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:43,653
God please!

685
00:48:43,703 --> 00:48:46,245
Don't take my baby away!

686
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:51,870
Please!

687
00:48:52,953 --> 00:48:53,953
Come back!

688
00:49:05,453 --> 00:49:07,411
Where did you go!

689
00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:26,486
Don't do this to me again.

690
00:49:26,536 --> 00:49:27,387
I' m...
Please.

691
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:28,828
Trying to protect you!

692
00:49:35,245 --> 00:49:36,786
Anybody see y'all out there?

693
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:39,036
I don't know.

694
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:41,661
Alright.

695
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:45,403
Alright leave the doll with me!

696
00:49:45,453 --> 00:49:46,745
I'll take care of that.

697
00:49:46,786 --> 00:49:49,361
I don't want any trace of Hailey Lynn.

698
00:49:49,411 --> 00:49:50,887
Alright-
Means we got to get rid of everything

699
00:49:50,911 --> 00:49:51,762
in this house.

700
00:49:51,786 --> 00:49:54,328
The only child you have is Hayden.

701
00:49:54,661 --> 00:49:56,036
I'll stay here awhile,

702
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:58,453
until you get your mind right.

703
00:50:09,911 --> 00:50:11,286
It watched us.

704
00:50:14,453 --> 00:50:15,995
Looking at our every move...

705
00:50:16,953 --> 00:50:20,578
and waited till I wasn't paying attention.

706
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:28,786
Who is they?

707
00:50:29,078 --> 00:50:30,078
The invisibles.

708
00:50:34,536 --> 00:50:37,495
Alright, I want you to go in the back
room for a spell.

709
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:38,703
Uhm.

710
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:41,745
You need to rest
that frazzled brain of yours.

711
00:50:43,536 --> 00:50:44,536
Yeah!

712
00:50:45,328 --> 00:50:46,887
Yes, it's a bit, a bit too much for you.

713
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,911
I get it.

714
00:50:48,453 --> 00:50:50,445
Naw, yeah, naw I get it, I get it.

715
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,903
You's a bit tired that's all honey.

716
00:50:52,953 --> 00:50:54,995
You get nothing.

717
00:50:56,703 --> 00:50:58,453
You weren't there.

718
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:01,695
Rest isn't going to change

719
00:51:01,745 --> 00:51:02,745
what happened!

720
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:05,661
Yeah.

721
00:51:06,078 --> 00:51:07,078
Yeah.

722
00:51:07,286 --> 00:51:10,203
I know it's a bit much to take
in for a day.

723
00:51:10,495 --> 00:51:11,495
Um.

724
00:51:11,786 --> 00:51:13,320
But I'll take care of you.

725
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,661
Don't, don't worry none.

726
00:51:16,578 --> 00:51:17,578
Go on.

727
00:51:17,953 --> 00:51:18,262
Go on.

728
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:19,495
Everything will be alright.

729
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:22,995
Gone now.

730
00:51:49,495 --> 00:51:51,286
This here has tipped the scale...

731
00:51:51,953 --> 00:51:53,078
to no return.

732
00:51:58,411 --> 00:52:00,411
It's alright,
I'll make it right.

733
00:52:04,036 --> 00:52:06,703
Make it right-
Make her as comfortable as possible.

734
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:16,453
Tearing my heart to pieces.

735
00:52:41,744 --> 00:52:43,153
What you doing here girly?

736
00:52:43,203 --> 00:52:44,778
Bout made my heart skip a beat.

737
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,869
I wanted to surprise you.

738
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:47,095
Alright.

739
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:47,804
Where...

740
00:52:47,828 --> 00:52:48,953
Where your mama at?

741
00:52:49,244 --> 00:52:50,328
She's outside.

742
00:52:51,703 --> 00:52:52,744
Gone pull-up a chair.

743
00:52:53,786 --> 00:52:54,845
You take that doll of yours

744
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:56,361
everywhere you go, don't you?

745
00:52:56,411 --> 00:52:58,619
What kind of mother would
I be if I left her behind?

746
00:52:58,786 --> 00:53:00,661
You gonna be a real good mama one day.

747
00:53:06,203 --> 00:53:07,203
I'm hungry.

748
00:53:08,828 --> 00:53:10,861
What's this here, your mama
didn't feed you?

749
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:12,278
I like your cooking.

750
00:53:12,328 --> 00:53:13,911
Oh.

751
00:53:18,869 --> 00:53:20,703
I want some squirrel.

752
00:53:21,911 --> 00:53:23,244
Oh, is that right.

753
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:25,994
I suppose I can
mustard up a little something.

754
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,453
Put'em out there on, on the pit,
and burn'em up real yummy.

755
00:53:30,286 --> 00:53:32,078
Yeah I'm getting me some grub.

756
00:53:32,869 --> 00:53:33,869
Look uh there.

757
00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:36,861
You done turned little country
girl on me after all.

758
00:53:36,911 --> 00:53:38,369
Yep.

759
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:39,804
Alright, well

760
00:53:39,828 --> 00:53:40,554
got to go out there

761
00:53:40,578 --> 00:53:41,512
in the back of the woods to
fetch it.

762
00:53:41,536 --> 00:53:42,744
You coming?

763
00:53:45,911 --> 00:53:48,494
Nope, I don't like the woods.

764
00:53:48,911 --> 00:53:50,536
It's spooky in there.

765
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:52,411
You ain't got to worry none.

766
00:53:52,994 --> 00:53:55,694
The trees might come alive
and get me,

767
00:53:55,744 --> 00:53:58,869
and I won't be able to see you anymore.

768
00:53:59,953 --> 00:54:02,619
Okay. Well, If I'm gone...

769
00:54:03,744 --> 00:54:06,161
my wise old owl will take care of you.

770
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:10,911
He's always watching
with those big old eyes of his.

771
00:54:12,994 --> 00:54:15,744
Come on let's go fetch us some vittles.

772
00:54:41,994 --> 00:54:44,869
How do I tell Hayden
his sister is gone missing.

773
00:54:55,286 --> 00:54:56,578
So much to figure out.

774
00:54:58,911 --> 00:55:00,369
So much to do.

775
00:56:06,994 --> 00:56:09,661
So how am I going to tell your boy,

776
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:13,952
that his baby sister has
vanished into thin air?

777
00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:20,119
That's the truth.

778
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:23,702
Why do you act like he's not your son too?

779
00:56:24,744 --> 00:56:26,536
Why you changing the subject, huh?

780
00:56:27,202 --> 00:56:28,236
I didn't say he wasn't.

781
00:56:28,286 --> 00:56:30,327
Maybe it's the truth he won't believe.

782
00:56:30,994 --> 00:56:33,244
It's still the truth, Jasper.

783
00:56:34,952 --> 00:56:36,827
Why you keep staring out this window?

784
00:56:38,702 --> 00:56:40,786
Till my baby comes home.

785
00:56:45,952 --> 00:56:48,352
I really hate to break it to
you like this, darling but...

786
00:56:48,994 --> 00:56:51,161
that little sweetness of heaven
ain't coming back.

787
00:56:57,202 --> 00:56:58,786
How do you know this?

788
00:57:01,494 --> 00:57:04,702
Maybe the spirits
in the sky took her cause...

789
00:57:08,494 --> 00:57:10,536
you forgot about your first love.

790
00:57:12,286 --> 00:57:14,202
Who are you talking about?

791
00:57:16,661 --> 00:57:18,911
You know, you worship that little girl.

792
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,202
Maybe God took her away because...

793
00:57:22,202 --> 00:57:23,786
wanted you to focus on him.

794
00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:26,911
It's not fair.

795
00:57:27,327 --> 00:57:29,536
You crossing the line now, Penelope.

796
00:57:29,702 --> 00:57:31,027
You're wrong.

797
00:57:31,077 --> 00:57:32,861
It can't be true.

798
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:35,652
Then how do you explain it, huh?

799
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,369
A leprechaun didn't slide down
a rainbow and take her away.

800
00:57:38,577 --> 00:57:41,577
Things don't just vanish
into thin air, Penelope!

801
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:46,702
You never believed me.

802
00:57:47,494 --> 00:57:49,111
You think I've been lying?

803
00:57:49,161 --> 00:57:51,911
Why else would you be acting this way?

804
00:57:55,077 --> 00:57:56,197
Think about it for a moment.

805
00:57:57,911 --> 00:58:00,369
I don't know who took her.

806
00:58:10,952 --> 00:58:12,077
For your sake...

807
00:58:14,702 --> 00:58:16,744
I hope it was God that snatched her up.

808
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:21,286
Cause things can get real ugly if it ain't.

809
00:58:23,077 --> 00:58:24,702
What are you saying?

810
00:58:25,286 --> 00:58:28,319
You sound like you know
more than you're telling.

811
00:58:28,369 --> 00:58:31,036
What I do know is that you
better get on your knees and pray.

812
00:58:31,536 --> 00:58:33,952
Alright, It's not the first
time people done gone missing.

813
00:58:35,244 --> 00:58:37,319
Do you remember what happened in the woods?

814
00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:39,369
I don't wanna remember.

815
00:58:40,994 --> 00:58:43,236
Our kids disappeared.

816
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,452
I done told you now I don't
want to talk about that.

817
00:58:47,077 --> 00:58:50,494
Something is in those woods,
and you know it.

818
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,879
You just don't know
when to be quiet, do you?

819
00:58:53,786 --> 00:58:55,536
I know you felt it, too.

820
00:58:58,536 --> 00:59:00,911
I heard the growling, Jasper.

821
00:59:03,827 --> 00:59:05,360
The smell of sulfur.

822
00:59:05,410 --> 00:59:07,535
I can't forget it.

823
00:59:10,702 --> 00:59:14,035
The air was so dense,
it was hard to breathe.

824
00:59:15,535 --> 00:59:19,069
It brought chills through my
body, scaring me out of my boots.

825
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,277
Why couldn't we see it?

826
00:59:21,327 --> 00:59:23,285
Just let it be, woman!

827
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:30,535
I think the Invisibles are here.

828
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,160
Let me tell you this much...

829
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:45,652
God don't let anyone or anything
come before him and you knew that.

830
00:59:45,702 --> 00:59:47,027
But you did it anyway.

831
00:59:47,077 --> 00:59:48,444
Now look what happened.

832
00:59:48,494 --> 00:59:50,819
Our Hailey Lynn is gone.

833
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:53,244
Sometimes you need to know
when to be quiet.

834
00:59:54,244 --> 00:59:57,035
I don't have the patience to be
listening to this foolishness.

835
01:00:05,035 --> 01:00:06,119
How long...

836
01:00:10,535 --> 01:00:12,785
does my heart have to bleed?

837
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,077
All you do...

838
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:21,202
is pour salt on my wounds.

839
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:26,119
Are you getting some kind
of sick pleasure out of this?

840
01:00:26,327 --> 01:00:27,220
Look!

841
01:00:27,244 --> 01:00:30,285
You did this to yourself.

842
01:00:30,494 --> 01:00:33,744
Can you just shut up?

843
01:00:35,202 --> 01:00:37,327
I hate being in this dark place.

844
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:41,619
It's time for you...

845
01:00:41,994 --> 01:00:44,035
to move on with your life now.

846
01:00:44,577 --> 01:00:47,119
Could you just stop talking?

847
01:00:49,452 --> 01:00:51,485
Well, if it ain't God
that snatched them up.

848
01:00:51,535 --> 01:00:53,295
You better hope they
don't come for you next.

849
01:00:55,577 --> 01:00:58,202
If not me, you.

850
01:01:01,494 --> 01:01:05,535
How many times do I have to
say it.

851
01:01:09,244 --> 01:01:12,402
Thee invisibles took her.

852
01:01:12,452 --> 01:01:15,360
You know, I can't keep listening
to this nonsense.

853
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:18,910
Kid of yours is gone, and nothing
could be done about it.

854
01:01:20,452 --> 01:01:22,744
Why don't you stop looking out
this here window.

855
01:01:24,202 --> 01:01:26,827
Listen, I'll cook you
up some vittles and...

856
01:01:28,035 --> 01:01:29,702
And I'um just head on back home.

857
01:01:31,327 --> 01:01:32,327
You're leaving me.

858
01:01:36,952 --> 01:01:38,244
It's time for you to...

859
01:01:39,035 --> 01:01:40,527
get your life back again.

860
01:01:40,577 --> 01:01:44,202
You know, I'm just holding you back.
I'm crippling you with my presence here.

861
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:47,410
No you're not.

862
01:01:48,619 --> 01:01:49,619
I need you.

863
01:01:50,952 --> 01:01:53,827
I'll still be loving you just
from a distance, that's all.

864
01:01:53,994 --> 01:01:55,827
Oh, no, no, I...

865
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,660
Please don't leave me,
I, I, I can't function without...

866
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:10,652
I can't function anymore.

867
01:02:10,702 --> 01:02:12,694
It's just.
It's just for a time.

868
01:02:12,744 --> 01:02:15,735
Please don't, please don't leave please.

869
01:02:15,785 --> 01:02:16,785
Please.

870
01:02:17,494 --> 01:02:18,777
All this time, I'll

871
01:02:18,827 --> 01:02:21,952
come back and be with you
just right now at the time.

872
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:26,277
I need you here with me, Jasper.

873
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:28,869
No, no, no, no, you don't.

874
01:02:29,285 --> 01:02:34,243
You need the man upstairs it's good for you
to just have some time with him alone.

875
01:02:34,285 --> 01:02:36,152
Just you and him.

876
01:02:36,202 --> 01:02:37,910
This, this is what's, what's best for you.

877
01:02:38,493 --> 01:02:39,493
Alright.

878
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,618
I can't keep holding ya.

879
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,493
I can't believe you're...

880
01:02:45,077 --> 01:02:46,535
blaming me for this.

881
01:02:48,243 --> 01:02:49,243
Well!

882
01:02:50,077 --> 01:02:51,493
You better believe it.

883
01:02:52,618 --> 01:02:55,285
You know, sometimes the truth
is a tough pill to swallow.

884
01:02:56,577 --> 01:02:59,285
You gotta just digest it and move on.

885
01:03:02,618 --> 01:03:05,493
That's all you have to say.

886
01:03:06,785 --> 01:03:08,952
I'll be praying for you.

887
01:03:10,035 --> 01:03:12,035
I'll be sending my prayers
up to heaven for you.

888
01:03:13,285 --> 01:03:14,327
Hope you get better.

889
01:03:15,202 --> 01:03:16,202
It's the best I can do.

890
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,285
Can't do no mo!

891
01:04:18,243 --> 01:04:19,702
Mommy!

892
01:04:39,202 --> 01:04:42,285
Hailey Lynn, is that you?

893
01:04:46,327 --> 01:04:47,368
Don't cry, Mommy.

894
01:04:49,035 --> 01:04:50,035
I love you.

895
01:04:54,952 --> 01:04:57,077
Come back.

896
01:05:08,743 --> 01:05:10,743
What you doing sneaking
around my property for boy.

897
01:05:13,577 --> 01:05:15,910
You said all this will belong
to me one day, didn't you?

898
01:05:16,535 --> 01:05:17,660
I ain't dead yet.

899
01:05:18,868 --> 01:05:20,068
Figured I'd come check it out.

01:05:21,243 --> 01:05:22,410
Yeah, alright.

901
01:05:24,743 --> 01:05:26,993
This here property is pretty wide and deep.

902
01:05:28,202 --> 01:05:30,035
I'd hate for
anything bad to happened to you.

903
01:05:30,285 --> 01:05:34,160
Like what?
Never you mind it.

904
01:05:38,493 --> 01:05:39,993
Hey uh.

905
01:05:40,618 --> 01:05:42,493
Who's grave you got dug up back there?

906
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:45,230
It'll be one for you if you
keep asking all them questions.

907
01:05:47,452 --> 01:05:49,035
Are you threatening me?

908
01:05:49,077 --> 01:05:51,118
Take it how you will, boy.

909
01:05:52,368 --> 01:05:54,785
Now, be no fool, don't be no fool.
Don't do that.

910
01:05:57,743 --> 01:06:00,651
I will beat you dead with my
bare hands right at my feet

911
01:06:00,701 --> 01:06:03,576
messing around with me;
and you know I'll do it.

912
01:06:03,951 --> 01:06:06,326
Not if I get you first.

913

Now I warned you!

915
01:06:14,035 --> 01:06:15,368
Best turn around and be gone.

916
01:06:15,410 --> 01:06:17,535
I ain't saying it twice.

917
01:06:25,076 --> 01:06:26,802
Look, I didn't come here to
shed blood with my dad.

918
01:06:26,826 --> 01:06:28,219
No, you didn't.
You came here being nosey,

919
01:06:28,243 --> 01:06:30,160
trying to see the site list!
Did I?

920
01:06:31,368 --> 01:06:33,701
What's with all this hatred
built up in your soul for boy?

921
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:36,201
I think you know
the answer to that already.

922
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:37,511
You need to just cut it out,

923
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,535

924
01:06:38,701 --> 01:06:40,901
Cause all this right here
is enough to wake the Seekers.

925
01:06:42,618 --> 01:06:43,618
Seekers?

926
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:47,993
Jasper what the heck are Seekers?

927
01:06:48,743 --> 01:06:50,535
You just need to step cautiously,

928
01:06:51,701 --> 01:06:53,160
cause they know you're here.

929
01:06:55,743 --> 01:06:57,076
So there is something in here.

01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:21,901
There's nothing wrong with me.

1024
01:11:21,951 --> 01:11:25,409

01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:34,718
There you go.

1078
01:14:34,742 --> 01:14:35,468
Thank you.

1079
01:14:35,492 --> 01:14:38,159
Alright. I'll bring them out.
Thanks.

1080
01:14:40,617 --> 01:14:42,257
Not bad, how are you?

1081
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:49,909
You really got your-well
you got your hat...

1082
01:14:49,992 --> 01:14:51,742
There's no cream or milk.
Naw that's fine.

1083
01:14:51,951 --> 01:14:53,859
Usually, typically it's 3 minutes.

1084
01:14:53,909 --> 01:14:57,326
And then you take this and you
go like this, you take this

1085
01:14:58,326 --> 01:15:01,159
go like that; then after you
do that you go like this.

1086
01:15:01,659 --> 01:15:03,617
Oh, okay. Thanks.

1087
01:15:05,576 --> 01:15:07,617
Why were you on the
floor crying a river last night?

1088
01:15:08,867 --> 01:15:09,718
What's going on in

1089
01:15:09,742 --> 01:15:11,409
that pretty head of yours?

1090
01:15:11,909 --> 01:15:14,117
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

1091
01:15:16,492 --> 01:15:19,201
Something is in that house
and I can't see it.

1092
01:15:21,242 --> 01:15:23,701
I was in the bathroom and it
tried to get in the room.

1093
01:15:23,784 --> 01:15:26,742
Now that was just me at the door.
No.

1094
01:15:28,034 --> 01:15:30,284
I know what I saw.

1095
01:15:32,326 --> 01:15:34,117
You in there sniffing bubbles?

1096
01:15:34,951 --> 01:15:36,151
The fragrance got you,

1097
01:15:36,201 --> 01:15:38,367
got you doped up with illusions.

1098
01:15:39,867 --> 01:15:42,909
I'm telling you something
mystical is happening in there.

1099
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:46,534
Maybe it's time for you to...

1100
01:15:47,117 --> 01:15:48,867
get some help again.

1101
01:15:49,242 --> 01:15:51,067
You promised...

1102
01:15:51,117 --> 01:15:51,760
you would never

1103
01:15:51,784 --> 01:15:53,117
put me away again.

1104
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,576
Oh, come on, you.

1105
01:16:23,909 --> 01:16:24,909
Almost...

1106
01:16:26,242 --> 01:16:27,284
Almost gotcha!

1107
01:16:37,784 --> 01:16:39,450
Yeah.

1108
01:16:40,992 --> 01:16:42,450
Yeah.
This is he.

1109
01:16:46,742 --> 01:16:47,992
No.

1110
01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:57,575
I left her in your care.

1111
01:17:04,742 --> 01:17:06,367
So what happens now?

1112
01:17:09,534 --> 01:17:11,159
Yeah.

1113
01:17:14,825 --> 01:17:16,117
Yeah.

1114
01:17:16,867 --> 01:17:18,325
Thank you.

1115
01:20:55,283 --> 01:20:56,051
Hey!

1116
01:20:56,075 --> 01:20:58,367
I thought I find you here.

1117
01:20:58,825 --> 01:21:00,325
Yeah. What's going on?

1118
01:21:02,908 --> 01:21:03,908
Well...

1119
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:05,908
I went over to Mom's house,

1120
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,825
and there was no answer.

1121
01:21:09,700 --> 01:21:10,700
So I sat...

1122
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:12,617
for hours.

1123
01:21:14,325 --> 01:21:15,783
She never came home.

1124
01:21:18,033 --> 01:21:20,492
Jasper. I'm getting
kind of worried about her.

1125
01:21:21,492 --> 01:21:23,450
You know, the last time we spoke.

1126
01:21:27,158 --> 01:21:29,400
Well, let's just say
it could have been better.

1127
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:31,492
I hate to break the news to
you like this son, but.

1128
01:21:35,033 --> 01:21:38,700
Your mama gone, and so is your sister.

1129
01:21:39,325 --> 01:21:40,450
Gone!

1130
01:21:42,283 --> 01:21:43,575
Gone where?

1131
01:21:44,492 --> 01:21:46,158
Did they move without telling me or what?

1132
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:50,617
Angels in heaven called them home, son.

1133
01:21:52,867 --> 01:21:53,867
What!

1134
01:22:02,367 --> 01:22:03,492
No.

1135
01:22:03,867 --> 01:22:04,867
No.

1136
01:22:10,533 --> 01:22:11,468
What happened to them?

1137
01:22:11,492 --> 01:22:13,108
Just calm yourself now.

1138
01:22:13,158 --> 01:22:14,325
Just tell me.

1139
01:22:15,117 --> 01:22:16,117
What happened?

1140
01:22:16,908 --> 01:22:19,617
All I can tell you is that...

1141
01:22:20,117 --> 01:22:21,325
She told me...

1142
01:22:21,908 --> 01:22:23,783
She just vanished right before her eyes.

1143
01:22:25,242 --> 01:22:27,783
She said some demon after her...

1144
01:22:30,075 --> 01:22:31,075
took Hailey.

1145
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:34,200
She was gone.
Never seen again.

1146
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,450
You believe that?

1147
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:38,108
Well, she believed it
and she went crazy.

1148
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:39,950
Penelope lost her mind Hayden!

1149
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:42,325
Talking to ghosts, and such...

1150
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:45,075
White coats came and got her.

1151
01:22:45,117 --> 01:22:46,950
And they took her away.

1152
01:22:47,575 --> 01:22:48,575
What?

1153
01:22:48,992 --> 01:22:51,192
Now all of a sudden, you can't
understand my speech boy!

1154
01:22:52,158 --> 01:22:53,950
The psych keepers.

1155
01:22:54,825 --> 01:22:57,700
I had to put her away
so she could collect some sense.

1156
01:23:00,158 --> 01:23:01,158
Really!

1157
01:23:03,783 --> 01:23:06,158
She was losing her
raggedy mind up in that house.

1158
01:23:06,992 --> 01:23:09,117
I had to do it now.
I...

1159
01:23:10,992 --> 01:23:12,867
I feel mighty guilty for what I did.

1160
01:23:14,867 --> 01:23:16,117
I saw her and she was...

1161
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:20,408
bound up, chained like some darn dog.

1162
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,783
When did all this happen?

1163
01:23:31,075 --> 01:23:33,366
It's uh, awhile back.

1164
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:36,825
About three months ago.

1165
01:23:37,783 --> 01:23:39,983
You know, she's always been
a tad touched in the noggin.

1166
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:42,658
Three months!

1167
01:23:44,283 --> 01:23:45,450
Why didn't I know about this?

1168
01:23:47,991 --> 01:23:49,200
I'm telling you now.

1169
01:23:49,575 --> 01:23:50,575
Alright.

1170
01:23:50,783 --> 01:23:53,316
She turned into a lonely tune on me.
A plum D nutcase!

1171
01:23:53,366 --> 01:23:57,408
She was talking to nobody and
and listening to nothing.

1172
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,991
Now, I'm telling you, son.

1173
01:24:00,366 --> 01:24:02,509
She had a couple of screws
loose up in that head of hers.

1174
01:24:02,533 --> 01:24:04,566
She went crazy right before my eyes.

1175
01:24:04,616 --> 01:24:06,533
I didn't know what else to do.

1176
01:24:07,533 --> 01:24:08,533
I tried calling you.

1177
01:24:08,825 --> 01:24:10,783
You didn't answer your phone.

1178
01:24:15,366 --> 01:24:16,991
So, let me get this straight.

1179
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:19,575
So after all this time,

1180
01:24:20,866 --> 01:24:22,825
you didn't try to call again?

1181
01:24:26,491 --> 01:24:28,241
I didn't have time to.

1182
01:24:28,866 --> 01:24:31,783
I needed to get my mind right.

1183
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:33,158
Alright.

1184
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:35,092
You don't know what it's like over here.

1185
01:24:35,116 --> 01:24:36,116
You just don't know.

1186
01:24:36,866 --> 01:24:37,866
No.

1187
01:24:38,408 --> 01:24:39,259
No.

1188
01:24:39,283 --> 01:24:40,283
You had time.

1189
01:24:40,991 --> 01:24:43,408
You just didn't choose to take it.

1190
01:24:43,533 --> 01:24:45,241
You weren't here.

1191
01:24:47,366 --> 01:24:48,658
You don't understand it all.

1192
01:24:49,116 --> 01:24:50,191
It was so much going on.

1193
01:24:50,241 --> 01:24:51,441
I mean, she said she was...

1194
01:24:52,241 --> 01:24:53,866
hearing voices in her head.

1195
01:24:54,991 --> 01:24:56,575
Hailey could see them.

1196
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:58,325
You say what now?

1197
01:24:59,616 --> 01:25:01,658
She said something was in the house.

1198
01:25:11,283 --> 01:25:14,491
Lord hold my hand tight, and calm my mind.

1199
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:22,658
Are you kidding me?

1200
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:28,200
All this trickery
of my mind, it ain't right.

1201
01:25:28,658 --> 01:25:30,900
Son, I'm telling you it ain't
right. Do you hear me?

1202
01:25:30,950 --> 01:25:31,717
Oh, I hear you.

1203
01:25:31,741 --> 01:25:34,158
Are you listening to me?

1204
01:25:35,741 --> 01:25:39,866
Cuckoo birds whistled a special
tune just for her ears to hear.

1205
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,580
It's like she was talking to
the ghost and...

1206
01:25:43,366 --> 01:25:44,575
and listening to it.

1207
01:25:46,283 --> 01:25:47,283
Tricks!

1208
01:25:47,783 --> 01:25:50,816
Yeah, all the poof now you see me,

1209
01:25:50,866 --> 01:25:53,491
now you don't. What was going
on over there, huh?

1210
01:25:56,741 --> 01:25:58,316
How she up and just disappear?

1211
01:25:58,366 --> 01:25:59,366
I don't know.

1212
01:26:07,408 --> 01:26:08,616
All that uh...

1213
01:26:09,366 --> 01:26:11,741
dabbling in the spirits...

1214
01:26:12,575 --> 01:26:14,691
stirring up spooks and stuff.

1215
01:26:14,741 --> 01:26:16,900
I mean, I don't play
that kind of games boy.

1216
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:17,950
No.

1217
01:26:18,283 --> 01:26:19,491
It wasn't nothing like that.

1218
01:26:20,116 --> 01:26:22,075
With my own two eyes, I saw her.

1219
01:26:22,408 --> 01:26:23,408
Yeah!

1220
01:26:23,658 --> 01:26:25,191
I saw her twirling rocks.

1221
01:26:25,241 --> 01:26:27,525
And, and burning sage all over the house.

1222
01:26:27,575 --> 01:26:29,441
Like a like a witch from hell.

1223
01:26:29,491 --> 01:26:32,158
If it was a spirit she was talking to,

1224
01:26:32,491 --> 01:26:35,491
she brought it there;
conjuring up the unknown, boy!

1225
01:26:37,116 --> 01:26:38,616
That's where you're wrong.

1226
01:26:39,116 --> 01:26:43,075
She was scared, Jasper.
Scared of what?

1227
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:46,950
She was burning it to make sure
the spirits would go away.

1228
01:26:48,116 --> 01:26:49,824
They were in the house.

1229
01:26:50,616 --> 01:26:53,283
Jasper she was trying to protect Hailey.

1230
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:55,399
It's got my mind spinning boy!

1231
01:26:55,449 --> 01:26:57,074
It's got my mind spinning.

1232
01:26:57,908 --> 01:27:00,949
I mean she said that
they were whispering in her ear.

1233
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:03,441
What kind of nonsense is that?

1234
01:27:03,491 --> 01:27:04,774
Maybe they did.

1235
01:27:04,824 --> 01:27:06,064
Maybe they did.

1236
01:27:06,741 --> 01:27:07,783
Are you crazy?

1237
01:27:08,533 --> 01:27:10,524
You been spending so much time
with her that

1238
01:27:10,574 --> 01:27:11,949
the crazies that latched onto you.

1239
01:27:12,366 --> 01:27:13,533
How dare you.

1240
01:27:15,616 --> 01:27:16,616
She was my mom.

1241
01:27:17,491 --> 01:27:19,524
Yeah It sounds like a hereditary situation.

1242
01:27:19,574 --> 01:27:20,574
I'm done.

1243
01:27:21,324 --> 01:27:23,533
Now wait, now wait Hayden.

1244
01:27:24,324 --> 01:27:25,324
Listen to me.

1245
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:27,908
Little girls...

1246
01:27:28,408 --> 01:27:31,366
don't just go poof and vanish into nothing.

1247
01:27:31,408 --> 01:27:33,408
I mean, you do know that, don't you?

1248
01:27:34,283 --> 01:27:35,324
All I know...

1249
01:27:36,908 --> 01:27:38,741
is that my whole family's dead.

1250
01:27:41,324 --> 01:27:42,866
Son you're not alone.

1251
01:27:45,283 --> 01:27:46,283
I'm still here.

1252
01:27:46,866 --> 01:27:47,866
I ain't going nowhere.

1253
01:27:49,074 --> 01:27:50,533
What good is that?

1254
01:27:53,616 --> 01:27:54,425
You locked my mother up

1255
01:27:54,449 --> 01:27:55,774
because she was full of grief.

1256
01:27:55,824 --> 01:27:56,824
Are you kidding me!

1257
01:27:56,949 --> 01:27:58,358
Just now calm yourself.

1258
01:27:58,408 --> 01:27:59,949
That's not going to happen.

1259
01:28:09,074 --> 01:28:10,533
I still love you.

1260
01:28:11,574 --> 01:28:12,741
You're my blood. My only son.

1261
01:28:14,241 --> 01:28:15,241
My only son.

1262
01:28:17,158 --> 01:28:18,158
My mom...

1263
01:28:19,158 --> 01:28:20,158
was scared...

1264
01:28:20,699 --> 01:28:22,949
living in the house by herself alone.

1265
01:28:24,158 --> 01:28:25,983
And nobody tried to call me.

1266
01:28:26,033 --> 01:28:27,324
Nobody...

1267
01:28:28,408 --> 01:28:29,783
tried to find me.

1268
01:28:31,199 --> 01:28:32,283
Scared.

1269
01:28:34,158 --> 01:28:36,533
So you and Jozetta just keeping
your mom secrets, huh?

1270
01:28:36,991 --> 01:28:37,991
Secrets.

1271
01:28:42,574 --> 01:28:44,324
It was plain to see, man.

1272
01:28:46,533 --> 01:28:47,533
You know what?

1273
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:50,824
It doesn't matter.

1274
01:28:51,741 --> 01:28:53,408
Everybody's dead.

1275
01:28:56,199 --> 01:28:59,074
What's really in the woods, Jasper.

1276
01:28:59,408 --> 01:29:01,658
I know you know the truth.

1277
01:29:02,908 --> 01:29:04,491
You just mind your business.

1278
01:29:04,574 --> 01:29:06,449
Alright, just let it be.

1279
01:29:08,616 --> 01:29:10,033
You still won't tell me.

1280
01:29:11,949 --> 01:29:13,449
Why our kids being kidnapped.

1281
01:29:13,866 --> 01:29:15,316
Hey, you let it be

1282
01:29:15,366 --> 01:29:17,399
and just let the dead

1283
01:29:17,449 --> 01:29:18,449
lie in peace!

1284
01:29:18,699 --> 01:29:20,283
You know what, I'm done!

1285
01:29:56,116 --> 01:29:56,925
What are you doing?

1286
01:29:56,949 --> 01:29:58,658
Banging on my door like some fool.

1287
01:29:59,033 --> 01:30:00,566
How'd you even know I was here anyway?

1288
01:30:00,616 --> 01:30:02,074
I didn't.

1289
01:30:04,283 --> 01:30:05,574
You weren't home so...

1290
01:30:06,324 --> 01:30:08,116
I figured you was here.

1291
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:09,491
Look Jasper!

1292
01:30:10,741 --> 01:30:11,908
Those things are real.

1293
01:30:11,949 --> 01:30:13,592
Boy, I ain't in the mood
for no riddles, now!

1294
01:30:13,616 --> 01:30:15,056
What kind of sense of humor you got?

1295
01:30:15,699 --> 01:30:17,991
What is your marbles rolling
on the floor or what.

1296
01:30:18,782 --> 01:30:21,032
Something is in the woods.

1297
01:30:21,491 --> 01:30:22,574
Calm down now.

1298
01:30:23,074 --> 01:30:24,914
What you out there
doing on my property anyway.

1299
01:30:25,991 --> 01:30:27,782
Those things in the woods.

1300
01:30:29,866 --> 01:30:30,907
Say what now?

1301
01:30:31,491 --> 01:30:32,531
You got some kind of...

1302
01:30:33,741 --> 01:30:36,074
monster back there hiding in the woods.

1303
01:30:37,782 --> 01:30:39,282
Just what did you see?

1304
01:30:41,741 --> 01:30:43,899
It's not about what I saw.

1305
01:30:43,949 --> 01:30:45,574
It's what I felt.

1306
01:30:47,282 --> 01:30:48,691
See you being nosey,

1307
01:30:48,741 --> 01:30:50,032
bout got you killed.

1308
01:30:50,282 --> 01:30:51,282
You satisfied now?

1309
01:30:51,657 --> 01:30:52,657
No!

1310
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:55,899
It like to bit you in the buttocks

1311
01:30:55,949 --> 01:30:58,407
or ripped your head clean off.

1312
01:31:00,616 --> 01:31:03,032
Didn't I tell you not to go out there.

1313
01:31:03,449 --> 01:31:05,529
You know, you lucky you
didn't get dragged away...

1314
01:31:05,574 --> 01:31:06,814
disappearing into the darkness.

1315
01:31:06,991 --> 01:31:08,782
What the heck is out there?

1316
01:31:10,657 --> 01:31:12,991
Why can't you mind your business boy?

1317
01:31:13,116 --> 01:31:14,441
Ain't it enough that it chased

1318
01:31:14,491 --> 01:31:15,824
you out of there.

1319
01:31:17,116 --> 01:31:18,782
Something invisible is out there.

1320
01:31:21,782 --> 01:31:22,782
Invisible.

1321
01:31:26,407 --> 01:31:29,366
So now, now you,
you feeling invisible things.

1322
01:31:30,782 --> 01:31:32,566
Does that make any sense to you?

1323
01:31:32,616 --> 01:31:33,616
Does it?

1324
01:31:34,366 --> 01:31:36,657
Stop pretending that you don't
know what's going on.

1325
01:31:37,657 --> 01:31:40,157
Okay, It's snatching up bodies
and you know it.

1326
01:31:41,074 --> 01:31:43,191
How many people must die
before you confess?

1327
01:31:43,241 --> 01:31:44,241
You need to hush up!

1328
01:31:45,116 --> 01:31:47,032
Count your blessings.

1329
01:31:47,241 --> 01:31:49,324
And don't go back out there.

1330
01:31:50,032 --> 01:31:51,066
And if I do?

1331
01:31:51,116 --> 01:31:53,036
Foolish people do foolish things.
Are you a fool?

1332
01:31:54,782 --> 01:31:55,592
No, I'm not.

1333
01:31:55,616 --> 01:31:56,899
Okay.

1334
01:31:56,949 --> 01:31:57,467
Okay.

1335
01:31:57,491 --> 01:31:58,491
Alright.

1336
01:31:58,741 --> 01:32:00,461
Well, you might not make
it out there alive.

1337
01:32:01,699 --> 01:32:02,824
Listen here.

1338
01:32:02,949 --> 01:32:04,032
Listen to me clearly.

1339
01:32:05,616 --> 01:32:07,657
