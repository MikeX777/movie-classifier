1
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,454
Ah, my dear Ann, so
glad to see you again

2
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,668
after all these minutes.

3
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:30,628
20 of them at least.

4
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,042
50 minutes, Johnny.

5
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,050
= 50 minutes!

6
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,967
50 years away from you, Ann.

7
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,211
You're not flattering me, Johnny.

8
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,133
Now what have you been doing?

9
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,723
Waiting for the specimen of Dr. Lee's.

10
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,935
I could check with Dr.
Lee's office nurse, you know.

11
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,394
But I'll let it go at that.

12
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:47,979
Aw gee, thanks, Ann.

13
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,189
Dr. Lee would like to have the report

14
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,307
as quickly as possible.

15
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,684
=t don't think we can run another test

16
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,231
this afternoon, Johnny.

17
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,103
Oh, that's okay with me.

18
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,195
But if the boss wouldn't spend

19
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,939
so much time experimenting
with those rabbits,

20
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,861
he'd get done with...

21
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,110
That's Mr. stendahl"s business, Johnny.

22
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,329
And if you wouldn't spend so
much time running errands.

23
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,706
Deliver this to Dr. Jackson.

24
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,710
Okay, Ann.

25
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:14,089
Coagulation test for Dr. Lee.

26
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:15,548
= sh.

27
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,343
= another blood donor?

28
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,760
Yes, the transfusion's
just been completed.

29
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,632
How is the experiment
progressing this time?

30
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,392
Mr. stendahl will know in just a minute.

31
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,316
Well, Ann, there is a chance

32
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,861
this time the electric needle
accomplishing its purpose.

33
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,278
Oh, I hope so, Mr. stendahl.

34
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,321
But I can hardly believe

35
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,115
that rabbit's been dead for 12 hours.

36
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,704
I know, and yet the electric current,

37
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,120
plus transfusions has revived the heart

38
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,958
so that it is functioning.

39
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,418
There's the proof.

40
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,544
Now everything depends upon what happens

41
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,042
when the heart is no longer
stimulated by electricity.

42
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,419
If the heart stops beating

43
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,419
when the current is switched off,

44
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,921
can you resume the process?

45
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:03,933
= no.

46
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,804
There's only one chance and this is it.

47
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,311
All right, Don.

48
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,680
Well, start putting the equipment away.

49
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,531
= Ann!

50
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,530
Mr. stendahl!

51
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,324
Look!

52
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,780
= it was dead.

53
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,193
Now it lives!

54
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,943
We've made a successful beginning at last.

55
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,784
That's wonderful, Mr. stendahl.

56
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,046
Did you say something about
a coagulation test, Ann?

57
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,460
Yes, Mr. stendahl, but I can run it.

58
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,299
And I'll watch the rabbit, sir.

59
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,133
Thank you, Don.

60
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,377
Thank you, Ann.

61
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,754
Maybe I would like to
relax a little while.

62
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,081
What do you want?

63
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,165
I've come for the body.

64
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,204
What body?

65
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,212
Here.

66
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,581
= oh.

67
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,128
The ape woman, huh?

68
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,796
City medical college wants her now

69
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:46,919
instead of in the morning.

70
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,010
City college.

71
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,931
Fine time of the night
to come for this one.

72
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,597
But you're welcome to her.

73
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,141
Glad to get rid of that animal.

74
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,827
Wait a minute, I gotta
check with the police first.

75
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,746
- Police?
- Yes, the law.

76
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,637
What gets me is, why move
that stiff at this hour?

77
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:17,634
We're scheduled to be taken

78
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,557
to the city medical
college in the morning.

79
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,020
Mm-hmm.

80
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,855
But this is the time we
generally move 'em, ain't it?

81
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,395
Yeah, in, not out.

82
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,402
Mm-hmm.

83
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,820
Hey, anybody here?

84
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:30,824
Are you kidding?

85
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,742
I wonder where Fred is.

86
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:35,576
= can't be far.

87
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,820
Looks like he's just been eating.

88
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,786
Keep your eyes straight ahead!

89
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,372
Oh, yeah, what gives.

90
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,539
Shut up, get over in that closet!

91
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,545
Hey, let me out of here!

92
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,841
- Let me out!
- Let me out!

93
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,804
Let me out of here!

94
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,639
Come on, let us out!

95
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,473
Open it up!

96
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,184
Open the door, come on, let us out!

97
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,053
Hey you! - Come on!

98
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,805
Let us out of here!

99
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,604
Let us out, come on, let us out!

100
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,397
Let us out of here, let us out!

101
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,895
Open it up!

102
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,634
Fred!

103
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,597
Hey, Fred!

104
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:21,637
Hey, let us out of here!
= let us out!

105
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,555
Let us out! - Open it up!

106
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,804
Open the
door, come on, let us out.

107
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,975
Well, what do you know.

108
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,348
How did you two guys get in there?

109
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,189
Where's Fred?

110
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,024
= that's what we'd like to know.

111
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,518
Some guy locked us in there.

112
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,894
Hey, you better go outside

113
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,612
and see if our wagon's still there.

114
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,617
I don't get it.

115
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,533
I went out to eat and Fred stayed here.

116
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,573
Maybe you was lucky.

117
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,975
= get down!

118
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,552
So, you're afraid of her, huh?

119
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,470
You say, you didn't see
the man who held you up?

120
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,565
Okay, you think you could
recognize his voice?

121
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,308
Oh, I think maybe I could.

122
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,278
Huh, if I ever heard it
again, I'd remember it.

123
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,822
Get that, will ya?

124
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,281
Right.

125
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,197
Well, whoever the man was,
he came here for something.

126
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,821
There's only one thing you
can take out of a morgue.

127
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,163
It's for you, Harrigan.

128
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,167
= thanks.

129
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,668
Harrigan, homicide squad.

130
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,163
Huh?

131
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,175
Where?

132
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,797
Oh, yeah, I get it.

133
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:44,635
Yeah, thanks a lot.

134
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,639
That oughta help.

135
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:48,931
Your dead wagon crashed and burned

136
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,050
on the Ridge fort highway,

137
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,678
I always liked that old bus.

138
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,930
Me too.

139
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,439
Maybe this is the answer
to what this is all about.

140
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,366
Where are you keeping the ape woman?

141
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,200
Over here, you want to see her?

142
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,204
= yeah.

143
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,626
Fred used to say I'd wind
up in one of those things.

144
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,167
But you can't figure about
death, even when it's murder.

145
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,338
Fred, it's Fred!

146
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,427
What's he doing in there?

147
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,431
Obvious, isn't it?

148
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,851
Blood count, coagulation,
sputum and acetone level.

149
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:38,859
Four more.

150
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:42,356
I won't get around
to those tests til later.

151
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,478
I've gotta finish these slides

152
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,526
and deliver them to Dr.
Jackson immediately.

153
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:05,969
Dreaming again?

154
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,096
Mm-hmm.

155
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,682
Same old dream, 'bout when
you finished medical school.

156
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,516
It's only one more year.

157
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,932
Plus two years internship.

158
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,976
Sometimes those three years seem endless.

159
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,599
= t know.

160
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,602
It's really tough when
a guy can't even afford

161
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:26,480
to buy his best girl an engagement ring.

162
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,697
If she wanted one.

163
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,200
Darling, you know I do.

164
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,865
Well, why didn't you say so?

165
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,987
= did I have to?

166
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,750
= look.

167
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,078
Do you suppose you could
make my fraternity pin do

168
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,456
in place of a ring for a little while?

169
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:47,708
Darling, it's a beautiful pin.

170
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:49,805
Okay.

171
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,806
Consider yourself engaged.

172
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,810
Yes, sir.

173
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:57,517
Anything else?

174
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,602
Oh, yes.

175
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,226
Gee, you think of everything, don't ya?

176
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,942
Only the important things, darling.

177
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,492
Is this strictly in
the interest of science?

178
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,659
I'm sorry to break this up.

179
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,532
I'm Harrigan from headquarters.

180
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,535
Oh, another one of those tests
from the police department.

181
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,207
We haven't had one here in a long while.

182
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,750
No, just some information.

183
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,872
Are you stendahl?

184
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,839
No, I'm Don young,
one of his assistants.

185
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,800
And this is miss forrester, another.

186
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:30,634
Glad to meet you.

187
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,094
How do you do.

188
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,338
I'm working on a case

189
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,180
and I thought maybe you
lab people could tell me

190
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,139
what this is.

191
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,009
It's a surgical smock.

192
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,850
Oh, is that what you call it.

193
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:39,685
Yes,

194
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:40,599
surgical smock.

195
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,847
Say, would you mind trying this on?

196
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,724
I'd like to get an idea the size

197
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,316
of the man who was wearing this.

198
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Certainly.

199
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:00,622
A little bit chewed up, isn't it?

200
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,287
Yes, it is.

201
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,129
= not a bad fit.

202
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,796
No, it could have been worn
by a man about your size.

203
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,711
You don't suspect me, do you?

204
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,179
Oh no, if I did I'd ask you a lot

205
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,048
of routine questions like,

206
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,299
where were you last night?

207
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,431
Well, I was here at the lab
til about eight and then...

208
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,680
Don and I were together all evening.

209
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,181
Yes, we're engaged.

210
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,024
Oh, I see.

211
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,518
Well, if I suspected you, miss forrester,

212
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,939
I'd ask you where you lived?

213
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,438
Well, that's easy,
1021 east grove street.

214
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,986
And you, Mr. young?

215
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,449
= 381 beacon street.

216
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,159
What's this all about?

217
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,323
Not a thing.

218
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,947
I just wanted to find out where
to send the wedding present.

219
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,244
Now, I'll take that
smock if you don't mind.

220
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,543
And thanks a lot for the information.

221
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,956
You two can pick up where
I so rudely interrupted.

222
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,800
Well, I wonder what that was all about?

223
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,468
= Don?

224
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,057
You didn't do it, did you?

225
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,061
Yes, I did.

226
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,179
And I'm gonna do it again.

227
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,649
Well, I better get those
slides over to Dr. Jackson.

228
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,485
I won't get back by closing time as it is.

229
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,229
Grab them for me, will ya?

230
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,241
Mm-hmm.

231
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,903
I couldn't be sure of the fit,

232
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,367
but the laundry marks checked.

233
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,290
Here he comes now, get a good look at him.

234
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,081
Tail him, George.

235
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,089
Right.

236
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,775
Yeah, hello, Ann.

237
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,768
Hello, Mr. stendahl.

238
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,690
= where's Don?

239
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,780
He's out delivering
slides to Dr. Jackson.

240
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,899
Oh, well then you'll
have to come with me.

241
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,650
I have an emergency for Dr. kellogg.

242
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,332
= Mr. stendahl?

243
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,623
Mm-hmm?

244
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,333
= t have some news.

245
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,201
News?

246
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,874
Don and I, we're engaged.

247
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,499
Well, congratulations, Ann.

248
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,465
Thank you.

249
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,425
I was wondering when
that was gonna happen.

250
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,920
I'll be with you in a minute.

251
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,731
Mr. stendahl, did you see this

252
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,399
in the paper about that ape woman?

253
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,739
Yes, strange isn't it?

254
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,155
What would anybody want with it?

255
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,993
And to commit murder for it.

256
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,969
Well, we better be going.

257
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,887
Mr. stendahl, I'd
like to make a telephone call.

258
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:06,930
I'll only be a minute.

259
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,178
I'll wait for you in the car.

260
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,575
Hello, mother?

261
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,164
This is Ann.

262
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,658
Listen carefully now.

263
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,286
If the police ask you where
Don and I were last night,

264
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,414
tell them you were with us
until after one o'clock.

265
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,211
No, I can't explain now.

266
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,882
But please, mother, be sure
and tell them just what I said.

267
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,345
Goodbye.

268
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,890
I'm sorry I detained you.

269
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,100
That's all right, Ann.

270
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,389
It's a long drive out there.

271
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:11,867
Started so late, be dark before we arrive.

272
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,037
Will we be gone that long?

273
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,626
Mm-hmm.

274
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,166
Is there a phone there?

275
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,173
Probably.

276
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,507
Don?

277
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,593
Well, I told him I'd wait.

278
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,757
He has enough to worry him as it is.

279
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,845
Don, worried?

280
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,090
What about?

281
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,216
Did you read about that clue

282
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,014
to the murderer who stole
the ape woman's corpse?

283
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,636
= clue?

284
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,640
Oh, the surgical smock you mean?

285
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,812
Yes, just before you returned

286
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,685
to the office a detective was there.

287
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,614
= detective?

288
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,065
Yes,

289
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,614
he had that smock with him
and he got Don to try it on.

290
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,158
Nothing unusual about that.

291
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,497
They probably checked a number

292
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,741
of places using surgical smocks.

293
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,788
I know, but he wanted to know

294
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,207
what we were doing last
night and where we lived.

295
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,372
I think he suspects Don.

296
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,965
Oh, don't be silly, Ann.

297
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,261
How could Don possibly be
implicated in a thing like that?

298
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,657
Quiet!

299
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:08,243
Get back!

300
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,194
He seems to know you.

301
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,947
My affection for dogs,
they understand that.

302
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,340
Hello, moloch.

303
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,383
Ann, this is moloch, the caretaker.

304
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,394
How do you do?

305
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,776
This way.

306
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,781
Oh, moloch?

307
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,277
How's the patient?

308
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,821
She's all right.

309
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,068
She's in the other room.

310
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:52,909
= good.

311
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,028
Is Dr. kellogg here.

312
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,621
Oh, no.

313
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,707
Unfortunately, he's tied up in a meeting.

314
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,122
Take off your coat, Ann.

315
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,028
Come in, Ann.

316
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,975
Come here, Ann.

317
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,602
Quite harmless.

318
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,808
Nothing to be afraid of.

319
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,112
You.

320
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,900
T can't believe it.

321
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,527
Moloch, you clumsy fool,
they found that surgical smock

322
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,448
and traced it straight to my laboratory.

323
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,794
Her body's been well preserved.

324
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,913
They say she had the
strength of a gorilla.

325
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,965
= it isn't human.

326
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,550
Precisely.

327
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,669
This is a manmade creation, an experiment.

328
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,091
That's why I had to have the body

329
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,511
to prove or disprove my
theory of restoring life.

330
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,810
After all, I'm not experimenting
with a human being.

331
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,305
This is an animal, we
should recognize it as such.

332
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,228
But you committed a murder to get it.

333
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,152
Oh, yes.

334
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:54,569
You see, moloch is a true scientist.

335
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,990
He understands the
unimportance of a mere life

336
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:01,330
when it might impede progress.

337
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:05,951
= t can't understand

338
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,204
how I could have been so wrong about you.

339
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,796
All the time Don and I worked for you,

340
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,416
we both looked up to you as a great man.

341
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,669
I sincerely hope to
vindicate that judgment.

342
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:17,338
I want to take an experiment here

343
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,216
that no one has ever dared to try before.

344
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,058
Why did you bring me out here?

345
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,723
I told you, to help me.

346
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:24,686
Certainly you don't think

347
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,523
I'm gonna have anything to do with that?

348
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,982
Yes.

349
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,317
Well, I'm not.

350
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,732
Now, please let me out of here.

351
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,857
Ann, I need you.

352
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,859
What do you mean?

353
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,702
I need your blood.

354
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,877
Oh, no, no!

355
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:56,888
Oh no!

356
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:02,435
Oh no!

357
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,229
Why?

358
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,833
Her heart's beginning
to feel the strain.

359
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,465
You gonna take much more?

360
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:49,518
About another pint, if
her heart will stand it.

361
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,900
Not worried about her, are you moloch?

362
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,236
If you take out too
much blood, she'll die.

363
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,611
Oh, moloch, I believe you feel sorry

364
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,778
for my pretty assistant.

365
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,827
Don't be a fool!

366
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,251
We're scientists, not sentimentalists.

367
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,093
No offense, moloch, but with that face,

368
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,512
you're not exactly a Casanova, you know.

369
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,594
This is more in your line, moloch.

370
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,766
If I can succeed in
bringing her back to life.

371
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,015
Stimulated by the electricity,

372
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,726
the heart's been beating
regularly for about two hours.

373
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,231
It's now or never, moloch.

374
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,852
All right, take off the oxygen tent.

375
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,831
She's alive!

376
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,088
= this is what I've dreamed of.

377
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,964
Now let the doctors laugh at my theories.

378
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:11,976
Here's the proof.

379
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,182
Yes, we must let her rest

380
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:18,605
and breathe and live.

381
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,044
Ann.

382
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,582
Ann, we did it, she's alive.

383
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,796
Please let me go.

384
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,461
You'll be all right, now, Ann.

385
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,959
There's nothing to worry about.

386
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,096
Here.

387
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,221
It'll help you get your strength back.

388
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,322
Ann will be all right, now.

389
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:34,765
Well, moloch, all this only
proves half the theory.

390
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,300
What's half a theory.

391
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:41,847
Well, so far we've brought
life back to this hybrid.

392
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,021
If she can be transformed into a woman,

393
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,114
then I'd have brought
back life to a human.

394
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,403
Then why don't you do it?

395
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,119
Isn't as simple as all that.

396
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,659
The method for that transformation

397
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,248
has taken years of research.

398
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,121
And I don't have the records.

399
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,713
If I could only get them.

400
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,835
Of course, I know they're
in Dr. Fletcher's office.

401
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,937
But she didn't come
home at all last night.

402
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,522
She didn't even phone her mother.

403
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,605
I'm sure she's all right, Don.

404
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,443
= where could she be?

405
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:32,030
She's never done anything
like this before.

406
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,150
Well, perhaps she stayed
overnight with some friends.

407
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,073
No, I checked with everybody we know.

408
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,663
Didn't she say anything to you last night?

409
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,576
Hope I'm not busting in

410
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,124
on some vital experiment.

411
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,246
No, come in.

412
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,714
Thanks.

413
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,254
He a friend of yours, Don?

414
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:53,547
Oh, this is Mr. Harrigan
from police headquarters.

415
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,091
Oh, how do you do?

416
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,304
You stendahl?

417
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,138
Yes,

418
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,257
I'm glad to meet you.

419
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,098
= mutual.

420
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,467
= miss forrester here?

421
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,559
No, she isn't.

422
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:02,928
We were just talking about her.

423
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,019
She didn't come home last night.

424
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:04,854
Her mother was...

425
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,565
Yes, I know, her mother
telephoned headquarters.

426
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:09,059
That's why I'm here.

427
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,526
Where were you last night?

428
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,191
I was out looking for her.

429
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,029
Her mother phoned me.

430
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,648
She was very worried about Ann.

431
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,195
Must have been out pretty late.

432
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:18,865
I was, why?

433
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,453
One of my men called on you.

434
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,406
Oh, about the smock business?

435
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,955
Oh, it's just routine checking.

436
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,953
Surely you don't suspect my assistant

437
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,545
of being involved in anything...

438
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,710
Stealing a body from the morgue?

439
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:35,836
You'd be amazed how
suspicious we police get.

440
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,431
By the way, young man,
speaking of the morgue.

441
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,801
Why would your fiancee ask
her mother to lie for her.

442
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,018
What do you mean, lie?

443
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,889
Well, Mrs. forrester says
that her daughter told her

444
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,437
to tell the police that
you were both with her

445
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,150
until late the night
of the morgue incident.

446
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,769
Ann said that?

447
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:56,069
Yeah, obviously
preparing an alibi.

448
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:57,566
Why should she want an alibi?

449
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,281
That's what I'm going to find out.

450
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,413
Does that boy sound like the
one you heard in the morgue?

451
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,382
I don't know, could have
been, but I'm not sure.

452
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,876
Are you talking about my voice?

453
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,297
= yeah.

454
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,215
How about it, Jim?

455
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,430
No, I couldn't swear to it either.

456
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:22,640
Okay, fellas, thanks
a lot for coming over.

457
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,178
Say, what's this all about?

458
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,020
Do I look like a killer?

459
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,935
= you don't have to look like one to kill.

460
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,399
You're wasting your time, Harrigan.

461
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:33,189
Don has been my assistant
for several years

462
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,357
and I assure you that his
character is unimpeachable.

463
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:38,698
Yeah, what about the
disappearance of his fiancee?

464
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,112
You any theory about that?

465
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,202
Well, yes.

466
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:44,161
Could possibly be amnesia.

467
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,325
Amnesia, I don't believe it.

468
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,666
Well, Don, Ann has been
working awfully hard lately.

469
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,910
I myself am to blame for that.

470
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,127
It was very thoughtless of me.

471
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:54,043
Well, you'd know more about that than I.

472
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,210
I hope he's wrong, kid.

473
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,879
Thanks for your cooperation.

474
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,547
Goodbye, Mr. Harrigan.

475
00:34:58,555 --> 00:34:59,761
Oh, I'll be seeing you.

476
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,102
I've got to find Ann, sir.

477
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,642
Something must have happened to her.

478
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,139
I'm sure she's all right, Don.

479
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,766
But you said it might be amnesia.

480
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,642
Oh, well, that was just a wild guess

481
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,270
to appease our detective friend.

482
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,318
If you don't need me, sir, I'd...

483
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,315
I know, I know.

484
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,488
You want to go out and look for Ann, huh?

485
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,156
Go right ahead, Don.

486
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,164
= thanks.

487
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,516
Why do you always find
it necessary to kill

488
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,559
every time I send you for something?

489
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,024
Well, he come in and
switched on the lights.

490
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,071
Oh, I see.

491
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,398
You certainly turned that
office into a shambles.

492
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,865
I done it right, huh?

493
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,986
You, yes, moloch, you did very well.

494
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,700
All right, bring Ann in.

495
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,372
You want the ape woman, too?

496
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,587
Not yet, leave her upstairs for a while.

497
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,590
There must be something wrong.

498
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,396
She killed him!

499
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,839
I need some more of your blood, Ann.

500
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,058
Not much this time.

501
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,848
Just enough to get from it
the glandular secretions

502
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:58,974
that Dr. Walters used

503
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,648
in transforming the ape
woman into Paula dupree.

504
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,447
How is she?

505
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,285
Weak, that's all.

506
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,706
You don't have to worry about her, moloch.

507
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:16,309
Stendahl, look!

508
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,222
What is it?

509
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,845
Her hand!

510
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,942
The transformation is taking place.

511
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,199
Dr. Walters' data is correct.

512
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,949
I, myself, proved that I can restore life.

513
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,827
But now I can change that life
from one form into another.

514
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,296
Take off the oxygen tank.

515
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,348
So this is Dr. Walters' creation.

516
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,359
Paula dupree.

517
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,830
Paula?

518
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,542
Paula dupree?

519
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,080
Do you understand me?

520
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:43,941
Paula!

521
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,696
Her brain.

522
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,944
The only brain she ever had was subnormal.

523
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,488
In some ways subhuman.

524
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,263
Come, Paula.

525
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,032
You stay out here, moloch.

526
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,572
She must have absolute quiet.

527
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,409
The slightest shock
might prove very harmful.

528
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,130
Paula?

529
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,748
What's your name?

530
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,392
Paula?

531
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,062
Are you hungry?

532
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,107
What's your name?

533
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:50,901
Paula?

534
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:07,751
Moloch!

535
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:12,086
What are you doing with that needle.

536
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,500
Look at the meter, she's dying.

537
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,169
And you thought you'd
bring her back to life,

538
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,791
you crazy fool.

539
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,634
You'd have killed her.

540
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,003
= then she's dead?

541
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,510
She's all right now?

542
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,723
You ain't gonna hurt her no more?

543
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:35,101
No, moloch, we must make sure
that nothing happens to her.

544
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,440
I have a new problem now.

545
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,148
Possibly I can solve it.

546
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,194
I shall try.

547
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,110
Ann will help me.

548
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,490
Paula's brain is gone.

549
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,958
Her reactions are those of an animal.

550
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,044
= ain't that what Paula is?

551
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,162
Practically.

552
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:19,278
Dr. Walters succeeded in
transferring the brain

553
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:21,318
of his nurse into Paul dupree.

554
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,611
You're gonna put in a new brain?

555
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,619
Yes,

556
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,035
don't worry about miss forrester.

557
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,124
We're going to take good care of her.

558
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:34,039
= just don't hurt her no more.

559
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,458
Certainly not, moloch.

560
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,501
We'll take very good care of her.

561
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,635
I just can't understand it.

562
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,882
Maybe Mr. stendahl is right.

563
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,134
Maybe it is amnesia.

564
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,681
Take it easy, kid.

565
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,303
We'll find her.

566
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:55,102
I can't believe that anything's
really happened to her.

567
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,098
That's right,

568
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,476
don't let your imagination
run away with you.

569
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,733
This stendahl, you think
a lot of him, don't you?

570
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,076
Yeah, he's been
wonderful to me and to Ann.

571
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,660
He's a great man.

572
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,950
You mentioned some experiments
that he'd been working on.

573
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,914
Just exactly what are they?

574
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:14,830
Well, he's developed a
theory of resuscitation

575
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:15,952
and it works.

576
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:16,963
= oh.

577
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,787
How?

578
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,040
By electrical impulse.

579
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23,964
You mean,
restoring life to a dead body?

580
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,836
Yes, he's been at it for years.

581
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,305
It's quite a
trick if he can do it.

582
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,684
What does he experiment on?

583
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,724
Oh, Guinea pigs, rabbits, monkeys.

584
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,064
Just the other day he brought
a rabbit back to life.

585
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:38,228
No kidding!

586
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,820
1 see.

587
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,905
Well, I've got to be going.

588
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,532
I wish you'd
let me know the minute

589
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,026
you hear anything about Ann?

590
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,323
I certainly will.

591
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:51,331
See you later.

592
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,407
Oh, hello Harrigan.

593
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,783
How are you, stendahl?

594
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:57,285
Very well, thank you.

595
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,412
Any word about miss forrester?

596
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,503
Not yet.

597
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,214
But I think we'll find her before long.

598
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:03,583
I certainly hope so.

599
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,925
Been busy lately?

600
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,636
Yes, yes, they keep
us biochemists on the run.

601
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,640
I guess they do.

602
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:10,927
I'll be seeing you.

603
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:12,800
Well, drop in anytime.

604
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:13,927
Thank you, I will.

605
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,477
Well, I had hoped

606
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,817
we might have heard
something by this time.

607
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,320
Not even a lead to go on.

608
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,076
= too bad.

609
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:30,954
Oh, Don.

610
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,956
Did you start that test for Dr. Allen?

611
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,575
I'll get on it right away, sir.

612
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,462
Thank you.

613
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,581
Work is an excellent antidote for anxiety.

614
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,217
Yes, I guess you're right, sir.

615
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,934
Shut up, Jake!

616
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:45,945
Quiet!

617
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,427
Who are you?

618
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,679
What do you want?

619
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,396
Never mind that, where's stendahl?

620
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:06,398
= he isn't here.

621
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,814
Well, I gotta see him right away.

622
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:10,231
If you care to leave your name, I'll...

623
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:12,901
Never mind my
name, I gotta see stendahl.

624
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,778
Are you a friend of his?

625
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:16,741
Ain't none of your business.

626
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,235
Where is he?

627
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:19,157
= t don't know.

628
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:20,325
Why didn't you say so!

629
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,252
Where have you been?

630
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,211
I went in to get you.

631
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:34,295
That ape woman's gone.

632
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,460
= t know she is.

633
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,297
Didn't I tell you to watch her?

634
00:51:36,302 --> 00:51:37,883
Yeah, but she got away.

635
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,171
Where did you go?

636
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,294
Your place in the city.

637
00:51:40,306 --> 00:51:41,591
Oh, you fool!

638
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,839
Say, doc, I ain't sure,

639
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,557
but I think somebody tailed
me all the way out here.

640
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:46,721
What makes you think so?

641
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,892
I seen lights back of me all the way.

642
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,456
Good evening, Don.

643
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:13,502
Mr. stendahl!

644
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,370
I hardly expected to see you here.

645
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,172
= what is this?

646
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,176
What are you doing here?

647
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,217
Let go of me!

648
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,711
Moloch is my assistant, Don.

649
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:24,338
Yeah, well, tell him
to take his hands off me.

650
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,716
All right, moloch!

651
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:28,763
What I want to know is where'd
he get my fraternity pin?

652
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:29,851
I gave it to Ann.

653
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:33,514
Oh, I see.

654
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,566
Well, gentlemen, shall we go inside.

655
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,935
I'm performing a little experiment.

656
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:39,777
As long as you're here,

657
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:41,613
you might be interested in seeing it.

658
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:50,497
I call this my country laboratory.

659
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,835
= Ann!

660
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:55,707
What are you doing to her?

661
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:56,954
I told you,
I'm performing an experiment.

662
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:59,331
Ann has been most helpful.

663
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:00,549
If you hurt her, I'll...

664
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:01,462
Nobody ain't gonna hurt her.

665
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,381
You seem to be jumping to conclusions.

666
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:04,253
Why have you got her strapped...

667
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,880
Moloch, tie him to that chair!

668
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:44,510
We thought you were such a great man.

669
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:46,469
Such a wonderful man.

670
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,839
I regret that I must
destroy that illusion.

671
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,598
= t know.

672
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,058
What do a couple of lives mean

673
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,519
when it might impede scientific progress.

674
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:55,979
Is that it, stendahl?

675
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,599
I see that I've taught you well.

676
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,942
Moloch, see if you can find Paula.

677
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,107
Release the dog, it might help you.

678
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:05,071
I'll be with you in a minute.

679
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,157
Paula, that ape woman?

680
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:10,528
Yes, I brought her back to life, Don.

681
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,156
Now I'm going beyond that,
beyond what Dr. Walters

682
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,659
and Dr. Fletcher accomplished with her.

683
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,161
Her brain was destroyed.

684
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:20,834
I'm going to give her a new brain.

685
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:23,708
You mean Ann?

686
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,300
Yes,

687
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:27,465
you can't operate,
you're not a surgeon...

688
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:28,303
Don, you always said

689
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,263
that I was better than any surgeon alive.

690
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:31,677
But, but, you can't experiment!

691
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,300
You can't operate, not on Ann!

692
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:34,267
This is, this is...

693
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,271
= this is science!

694
00:54:36,398 --> 00:54:38,605
Operations are impersonal, Don.

695
00:54:45,741 --> 00:54:48,027
Ann, he must be insane.

696
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,035
I.

697
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,411
We're gonna get out of here, darling.

698
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,625
Believe that and hang on!

699
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:21,984
= Paula!

700
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,311
Maybe the dog will find her.

701
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,904
Perhaps, if she hasn't
gotten too far away.

702
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:58,437
Paula!

703
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:25,712
= listen!

704
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:26,546
There's the dog.

705
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,550
Yes, come on.

706
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,727
Get back, Jayden.

707
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,389
Paula.

708
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,230
= I'll hit her back...

709
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,098
No, moloch!

710
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,567
Any shock might undo
everything I've accomplished.

711
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,410
Paula, we're going back.

712
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,914
Do you understand?

713
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:07,375
Paula, we're going back to the house.

714
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,892
You're all right, Ann.

715
00:57:28,904 --> 00:57:30,189
Oh, Don.

716
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,202
Can you walk?

717
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,210
I'll try.

718
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:04,939
Get away!

719
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,820
Take her into the house, moloch.

720
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,053
Did you find anything interesting?

721
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,514
= just the usual lab stuff.

722
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,918
How do you figure stendahl in this?

723
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,306
= just a hunch.

724
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,019
What about this fella, Don young?

725
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,356
= he's in the clear.

726
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,225
I've just been using him to...

727
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:56,985
Old orchard road.

728
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,572
That's out off the Ridge
fort highway, isn't it?

729
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,069
I think so, why?

730
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,947
Here's a light and power
bill paid by stendahl.

731
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:09,080
413 old orchard road.

732
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,334
That ambulance burned
up out in that district.

733
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,341
Yeah.

734
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:27,977
I think we're about ready.

735
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,731
What are you gonna do?

736
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:34,101
Perform a very interesting experiment.

737
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,778
He's gonna take out her
brain, don't you understand?

738
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,364
He'll kill her.

739
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,447
= no.

740
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:42,818
Our friend is a little hysterical.

741
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:43,659
He's gonna kill her!

742
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,073
You've gotta stop him.

743
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,492
You ain't gonna do that.

744
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,706
You told me.

745
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:49,540
Shut up,
moloch, and get out of here.

746
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,909
= no!

747
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,957
You ain't gonna hurt her.

748
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:57,003
Keep away from here, moloch.

749
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,254
Stay where you are, I tell you!

750
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:08,354
Fool.

751
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,031
= Ann!

752
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:45,740
= no.

753
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,573
Take it easy, kid.

754
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,040
Who got stendahl?

755
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,333
= she did.

756
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:02,424
Good, that'll
save the state a little money.

757
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,463
Kind of rough going
for a while, wasn't it?

758
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:05,471
= yeah.

759
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:14,605
Darling.

760
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,349
This is really getting
married in the rough.

761
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,726
No engagement ring.

762
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,227
No honeymoon.

763
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,857
= t don't mind.

764
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:26,902
Is he after us?

765
01:02:28,328 --> 01:02:29,864
= not at 15 miles an hour.

766
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:38,539
Are you Don young?

767
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:39,546
Yes, sir.

768
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,299
What's this for?

769
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,293
Don't know, Harrigan's orders.
