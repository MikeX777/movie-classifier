MOZAMBIQUE OCTOBER 19, 1986
[in Portuguese] I don't remember
how many years have passed.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,479
It was a long time ago. But I remember
being young. I remember everything.

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,788
[in English] This is a huge
step toward our great victory.

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,079
A great victory! It's a great victory!

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,228
[in Portuguese] We wanted all the white
people out of Africa. And we did.

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:47,159
We became independent. But the whites from
neighboring countries didn't like it. There was a war.

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,039
And we would have lost. But help came to us.

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,170
I can't wait to get home.

10
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:55,256
Oh, come on. Imagine, we'll
be back and it'll be October.

11
00:00:55,268 --> 00:00:58,247
Rain, slush. And here you
have sunshine, warmth, and fruit.

12
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,959
And there's your wife and daughter.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,039
Oh, Raul, friend, tell me, would
you like to go to the Soviet Union?

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,645
How about a swap? I'll
stay here for the winter and

15
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:12,399
you go to the Soviet Union.
And in summer, we'll swap.

16
00:01:12,682 --> 00:01:14,279
- Did you see the snow?
- Snow?

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,559
﻿- Yes.
- No, I don't know.

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,519
To the Soviets!

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,519
That's right!

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,925
[in Portuguese] At first, I didn't
believe these people because

21
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:30,839
they were white too. But then
I saw that they were different.

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,279
[in English] Board Charlie-nine,

23
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,799
Charlie-alpha-alpha, have passed the Curla radio beacon.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,439
Estimated time of landing in
Maputo 19:25. Ready to descend.

25
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,999
[in English] It's all right.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,279
Do you think it'll work?

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,839
It's too risky a scheme.

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,042
We don't have any other options.
But if we pull this off, it'll be a

29
00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:09,519
unique operation. The autopilot is
guiding the plane to the beacon signal.

30
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,719
﻿No one has ever tried to trick the autopilot.

31
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,679
﻿And that's exactly what we're going to do.

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:20,316
﻿At 7:05 p.m. the radio beacon in
Maputo will go out. We have one minute

33
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:25,439
to launch ours. So the autopilot
will lead the Russians right to us.

34
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,999
﻿So we're all set.

35
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,559
﻿Fine.

36
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,439
Oh, Raul, here's one for you, by the way.

37
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,079
They were white, too, but they were
different. They honestly wanted to help us.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,719
Oleg, what's with all the twists and turns?

39
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,759
That's where the beacon is pointing.

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,359
﻿- It's weird, why isn't it going straight?
- The gears aren't working. There's no light!

41
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,732
﻿I can't see the lane!

42
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:14,479
- Maybe there's something wrong with their power.
- Fuck knows!

43
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,399
﻿- Pull!
- I'm pulling!

44
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,599
[in English] Fantastic!

45
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,567
﻿Listen, Bill, did you really have
doubts? Or, on the contrary, were

46
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:35,719
you hoping it wouldn't work? It's
just our job. Turn off the beacon.

47
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,839
That's it, let's go!

48
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,919
Whoever finds President Samora
Machel's corpse first gets 500 Rand.

49
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,799
Found it! Found it!

50
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,439
Good job! This time
victory is ours, Mr. Machel!

51
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,279
[in Portuguese] There were ten
survivors in that crash. One of them was me.

52
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,079

﻿Here, that's me. And these are the
Soviets! They were like gods to us.

56
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,439
Dad, you've told me that a hundred times!

57
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,879
Jose, where are you going?

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,319
To get water, Mom. Grandpa's
repeating that story again.

59
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,239
﻿That must be the hundredth time.

60
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,399
Hi.

61
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,759
﻿- Hello.
- How are you?

62
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,039
I'm great.

63
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,679
- Jose! Did you do your homework?
- We didn't have any homework at school.

64
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,879
Stop lying! Go do your
homework! Or I'll tell my mother!

65
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,039
Okay, okay.

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:38,159
Here! Pass it to me!

00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,559
You gotta learn how to
play first! Then come back!

00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,279
﻿- That's it, go on, get out!
- All right!

69
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,359
﻿I'm gonna be a great soccer
player, just like Eusebio. Got it?

70
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,399
That's it, get out of here!

71
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,519
﻿Go away! Go away!

00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:07,239

Where are you coming from?

74
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,359
It was some bandits. They killed
our mayor and his whole family.

75
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,679
﻿They told us to leave or they'd kill us all!

76
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,439
﻿- And the police?
- They were all killed too.

77
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,119
Jose! Go home now! And warn
your mother! How many were there?

78
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,639
﻿There must have been at least
a hundred. Armed to the teeth.

79
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,119
﻿Please everybody go home and stay calm!

﻿Don't you understand? I'm
the chief of police, I have to stay!

﻿Or we'll all have nowhere to go!

84
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:55,295
What if you get killed? Then we will have

85
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:56,799
nowhere to go, only the
children won't have a father!

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,261
﻿- And I won't have a husband!
- I said pack it up! Flora!

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:17,639

do with them, commander? Shoot them?

﻿On your knees!

﻿Don't! I'm coming with you!

- Yes, he agrees too.

﻿Let Granite go. But only for two weeks.

on and then he'll come here.

﻿And here we will make further decisions.

122
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,039
﻿I'll send Pasik with him, he'll make

﻿Is he there?

124
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,054
﻿So here's the situation. There's
a beautiful country in Africa called

125
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:48,799
Mozambique. Well, I don't have to
explain the geography. I hope you know it.

126
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,282
﻿Anyway, in the early 2000s, a
large gas field was discovered

127
00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:57,566
in northern Mozambique. Now
gangs have settled there,

128
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:01,915
sworn allegiance to the Islamic
State and are harassing civilians.

129
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:05,919
The local security forces
are not able to cope with it.

130
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,461
﻿The Mozambican authorities have
asked Russia and Sudan for help.

131
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:15,100
We had helped Mozambique during Soviet
times, our advisers were there from

132
00:14:15,112 --> 00:14:19,603
'76 to '91. We trained the local
army, everything is in the materials,

133
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:24,119

no fighting and no heroic deeds.

[in English] So, after long negotiations we were able to come to

152
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:25,399
an agreement with the government
of Mozambique about the gas fields.

153
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,745
﻿According to this agreement,
the profits from gas production will

154
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:34,203
be distributed as follows. Mozambique
gets 40%, our company gets 60%.

155
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:39,119
And you talk about this as your
victory? We usually leave the natives 20%.

156
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,919
﻿Dear Ethan, in this case, we're
talking about very large deposits.

157
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,639
﻿The total number of gas reserves
is 182 trillion cubic meters.

158
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,799
﻿Do you think we're the only ones
who would want that piece of the pie?

159
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:56,606
﻿And only because we offered
the Mozambican authorities terms

160
00:16:56,618 --> 00:17:00,639
that were not very favorable to
us, they signed a treaty with us.

161
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,286
﻿Thank you, Jane. Yes,
Ethan, you're right, of course.

162
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:05,999
The terms are
not very favorable for us.

163
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,639
﻿But who's to say those terms can't be changed?

164
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,439
﻿I'll tell you more, we're
already changing them.

165
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,519
﻿And our guest, Colonel Lionell,
is going to tell us all about it.

166
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,839
﻿The head of a private military
company stationed in South Africa.

167
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:34,359
﻿I think in a couple or three months the
Mozambican authorities will agree to 10%.

168
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,919
﻿How is that possible?

169
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,608
﻿Possible. It's a simple
mechanism. Put the president

170
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,799
of the country before a
choice: either 10% or nothing.

171
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,799
﻿Thank you, Colonel.

172
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,799
﻿You're welcome.

173
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,039
﻿Thank you, commander.

174
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,479
﻿- What are you looking at?
- We're hungry!

175
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,559
Yeah? Come here! Quickly!

176
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,479
﻿Didn't you hear what you
were told? Get up, get up!

177
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,919
﻿Food is for warriors!
You are not warriors yet.

178
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,839
﻿Don't touch my brother!

179
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,679
You're brave, aren't you?
You probably want to kill me?

180
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,719
﻿My men killed your brothers. But this is war.

181
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:52,439
﻿Your father was a policeman,
right? He just took the wrong side.

182
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,479
﻿He was protecting the government.
And our government is robbing us.

183
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,520
﻿Tell me, isn't it fair that
some people live very

184
00:19:04,532 --> 00:19:09,839
well and some people live
very poorly? It's not fair!

185
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,039
﻿But we have lived injustice
for many, many years.

186
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,239
﻿Don't you want it to be different?

187
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,399
﻿But to change the future,
you have to renounce the past.

188
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,759
﻿Only the strong are willing
to do that. Are you strong?

189
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,759
MOZAMBIQUE. NACALA AIRPORT
OCTOBER 2019

190
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,039
[in Portuguese] Everything all right, General?

191
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,639
﻿Yes...Just thinking.

192
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,039
Greetings.

193
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,559
﻿My name is Miguel. I'll be your interpreter.

194
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,999
﻿The General is very pleased that you
have responded to our request for help.

195
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:43,306
The General hopes that our cooperation
will strengthen the morale of our army.

196
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:46,242
Don't worry, we will.

197
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:48,599
﻿Well, the main thing is to
have something to strengthen.

198
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,479
﻿What do we do next, commander?

199
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,639
﻿Do we go to the next village?

200
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,439
﻿Let's go. But first, we have to get weapons.

201
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,439
﻿We ain't gonna last long with
machetes and old machine guns.

202
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,399
﻿Where can we get one? Police stations?

203
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,839
﻿There aren't many guns there either.

204
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,599
﻿I know where we get the guns.

205
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,959
﻿The military will send a
detachment here to look for us.

206
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,639
﻿We'll take it from them.

207
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,879
﻿We're going to the city of Mueda now.

208
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,799
﻿That's where our military base is.

209
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,319
﻿The town is in the province of Cabo Delgado.

210
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,959
﻿And there are no Muslim
fighters operating there.

211
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,319
﻿They are killing or kicking the villagers out.

212
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,719
﻿The General says they are very violent.

213
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:33,159
﻿They kill women and children, and cut
off the heads and Adam's apple of the men.

214
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,759
﻿That's their ritual. They're savages.

215
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,039
﻿A month and a half ago
we wiped out 200 fighters.

216
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,839
﻿Can we go there and see it for ourselves?

217
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,599
﻿The General says he doesn't have that kind of
authority. He already said more than he had to.

218
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,999
﻿Why did you agree to go with
them? They killed our parents.

219
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,119
﻿That's right.

220
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,119
﻿If we hadn't gone, they
would have killed us too.

221
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,248
﻿It would have been
better if they had killed us.

222
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,279
You're just a kid, you
don't understand anything.

223
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,279
﻿Yes, and also, I brought
you what you asked for.

224
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,639
﻿Great stuff, straight from Tanzania.

225
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,599
﻿Come with me. There's a job for you.

226
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,879
﻿Fine, but I've got another thing
for you to do: follow up on someone.

227
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,119
Stop!

228
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,559
﻿Give them machetes! Let them show
what kind of future warriors they are!

229
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,239
﻿This tree right here. Cut it down!

230
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,679
﻿Let's see how you hold a machete!

231
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:55,599
MUEDA
MOZAMBIQUE ARMED FORCES BASE

232
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,959
﻿The militants are operating in
about this area. Not far from this village.

233
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,959
I see.
What about the number of militants?

234
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,479
A lot of them. About a thousand.

235
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,479
﻿Where do they get their guns, do you know?

236
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,639
﻿We don't know.

237
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,759
The General says he sent a
detachment to the area early this morning.

238
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,719
﻿And he is confident that
they will find the fighters.

239
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,559
﻿I mean, if I understand correctly, that's
all the information we have at the moment?

240
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,439
Yes.
That's all for now.

241
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,719
﻿There is a police base in Mocimboa da Praia.

242
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,079
﻿They took a prisoner yesterday.

243
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,439
﻿Maybe he can tell us
where the fighters are hiding.

244
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,599
﻿Or he won't.

245
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,439
﻿Well, then you go there
and you find out on the spot.

246
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,239
﻿You can check out the local police too.

247
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,788
﻿Yeah, yeah. That makes sense.

248
00:26:59,491 --> 00:27:02,199
Because I thought you were gonna send me away.

249
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,159
﻿- God forbid. You imagined it.
- Yeah?

250
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,119
﻿I guess it's not a
military base, it's a circus.

251
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,959
﻿Yeah. And we're in an arena.

252
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,839
﻿What the fuck are the tactics?
You gotta start with discipline here.

253
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,799
﻿We got plenty of time for that, don't we?

254
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,439
﻿How long? Two weeks?

255
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,159
﻿Come on, guys! We'll teach
them. In an accelerated program.

256
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,203
﻿So, guys, the tasks for the near future are

257
00:27:49,215 --> 00:27:52,321
as follows: work with the personnel, find out

258
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:55,302
the level of training, identify problems,

259
00:27:55,314 --> 00:27:58,559
the ability to handle weapons.
You know, the usual.

260
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,039
﻿Slava! You're on medical review.

261
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,919
﻿Check the presence and
absence of medical supplies.

262
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,399
- ﻿Well, you know.
- Got it.

263
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,639
﻿Seryoga, you have a special assignment.

264
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,719
﻿Get a group of fighters and go
to Mocimboa da Praia with Pasik.

265
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,759
﻿Pasik will tell you all about it on the way.

266
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,039
﻿All right, men, let's get to work.

267
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:21,959
CABO DELGADO PROVINCE
10 KM FROM MBAO VILLAGE

268
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,039
﻿I sent a group to the
village of Mbao in the morning.

269
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,678
﻿They should be close by now.

270
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,559
I understand, General.
We're waiting for them now.

271
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,319
﻿Stop!

272
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,919
﻿Hurry up, hurry up! Gather your weapons!

273
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,759
﻿Kill the survivors, take no prisoners!

274
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,479
﻿Now we have guns and cars!

275
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,799
﻿Now our victory is close! We should celebrate!

276
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,799
﻿Get everything you need for the holiday.

277
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,479
﻿Commander, look who I
found! He was hiding in the car.

278
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,079
﻿Kill him?

279
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,879
﻿You wanted to hide?

280
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,039
﻿Kill him?

281
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,239
﻿No, we'll take it with us.

282
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,919
﻿That's our trophy. I want him alive.

283
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,279
General, I wanted to warn you.

284
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,319
﻿There's a group of Russians coming your way.

285
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,519
MOCIMBOA DA PRAIA. MOZAMBIQUE POLICE BASE
﻿They want to talk to that prisoner
of war you captured yesterday.

286
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,039
﻿Thank you for calling. We
need to solve this problem.

287
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,239
﻿The Russians must not find out anything.

288
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:52,471
﻿It's not a problem. He
won't say anything anymore.

289
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,039
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

290
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,919
It's our common interest.

291
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,159
﻿I think they're here.

292
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,919
﻿Don't worry, my friend. I'll take care of it.

293
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,487
The General is glad that you

294
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:18,039
decided to help us with
the training of our staff.

295
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,479
﻿We will help, of course.

296
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,159
﻿We're told you have a prisoner of war.

297
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,599
﻿We'd like to talk to him.

298
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,919
﻿Unfortunately, it's no
longer possible to talk to him.

299
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,879
﻿That's the prisoner right there.

300
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,639
﻿He tried to escape this morning.

301
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,479
﻿Took the gun from the
convoy. Had to shoot and kill.

302
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,279
﻿There's a tradition in Africa that
everybody gets killed on the run.

303
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:30,599
﻿Move it! Move! Move your feet.

304
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,239
﻿Hey, you, come here!

305
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,759
﻿Everybody be quiet!

306
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,319
﻿You're going to have a big day today.

307
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:08,679
﻿Today you can become real warriors.

308
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:16,319
﻿But to do so, you must prove that
you are ready to become warriors.

309
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,319
﻿Bring him here!

310
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,879
﻿Move! On your knees!

311
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,959
﻿This is our enemy!

312
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,559
﻿And enemies must be killed.

313
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,439
﻿If you don't kill your
enemy first, he'll kill you.

314
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,399
﻿You have a weapon.

315
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:40,919
﻿So do what the warriors have to do.

316
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,719
﻿If you are not a warrior, I will kill you.

317
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,839
﻿Well?

318
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,799
﻿Come on, hit it!

319
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,319
﻿Hit it!

320
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,839
﻿Now you!

321
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,679
﻿Don't.

322
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,319
﻿He can't survive alone in the jungle.

323
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,519
﻿Can you show me exactly
where your unit was attacked?

324
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,239
He can't give out that information
without management approval.

325
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,912
﻿General, I think you're
fighting the wrong war.

326
00:35:12,937 --> 00:35:15,396
﻿We're here to help you, but
you don't want to say anything.

327
00:35:15,421 --> 00:35:17,663
﻿You got 25 men killed.

328
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,519
﻿There! You don't talk like a fish on ice.

329
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,239
﻿It's about here, near Mbao village.

330
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,759
﻿This village was recently
attacked by insurgents.

331
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,279
﻿So tomorrow a small group
with your fighters will move in.

332
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,415
Let's take a walk to the village.

333
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,879
Andrei, where the hell are you going?We
just came here to check things out.

334
00:35:45,529 --> 00:35:46,500
We'll check it out.

335
00:35:46,525 --> 00:35:50,679
﻿And we'll take the general with us, maybe
he'll remember something else on the way. Yes?

336
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,959
The General says that's impossible.

337
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,399
﻿He has a meeting tomorrow
with his superiors in the capital.

338
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,719
Well, if it's with the management, it
goes without saying. Let's go, let's go!

339
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,759
﻿You proved today that you're warriors.

340
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,039
﻿But a warrior must be strong!

341
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,559
﻿That's why you have to
take power from your enemies!

342
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:57,119
﻿A man's power is concentrated here.
To take it away, you have to eat it!

343
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,159
﻿Eat it!

344
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,839
﻿Where are your hot guys?

345
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,119
Ask about something
lighter. Overheated, I guess.

346
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,519
﻿Andrei, you seem like a smart guy.

347
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,359
﻿Look at them. They don't give a shit.

348
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,919
﻿They're not allowed to shoot,
they're not allowed to have guns.

349
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,319
﻿And you want them to get
blown up on the firing range.

350
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,959
﻿- Well, where are your fighters?
- Major said they don't want to go.

351
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,959
﻿They're very afraid.

352
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,319
﻿OK, let's go. Let's go
enlighten their dim bulbs.

353
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,759
﻿Good, comrade?

354
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,959
﻿It's good food here.

355
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:41,279
﻿Freeze! Put the gun on the table.

356
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,999
﻿Tell him what to do.

357
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,359
﻿What do you need a gun for?

358
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,119
﻿I take your food away from you
and you're throwing napkins at me.

359
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,919
﻿Is your wife pretty?

360
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,319
﻿I'll take her too.

361
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,039
﻿Here!

362
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,519
﻿Payback.

363
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,839
﻿Well?

364
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,319
﻿What are you looking at?

365
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,359
﻿Are you ready to give up everything
- your house, your wife, your country?!

366
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,999
﻿Bon appétit!

367
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,799
﻿Just a minute.

368
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,279
﻿I'm ready to go! And so are my soldiers!

369
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,359
﻿Effective.

370
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,359
﻿Yeah, yeah. They're the heroes here.
And then they shit themselves and run.

371
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,096
MAPUTO

372
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,079
﻿On what terms did you
contract with the Russians?

373
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,839
﻿The Russians didn't come under contract.

374
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,719
﻿Our president has reached
out to friendly countries.

375
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,919
﻿The Russians came from Sudan.

376
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,719
﻿Russians... The Russians don't change.
I already met them here in the eighties.

377
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,519
﻿True, they were called Soviets back then.

378
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,839
﻿I remember that year. I'm aware of that.

379
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,399
﻿Weren't you the one who caused that
plane crash when President Machel died?

380
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,119
﻿And the Russians did a 180-degree turn then.

381
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,199
﻿That's right, the Soviets.

382
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:45,319
﻿Then they stopped being Soviet
and decided to have capitalism.

383
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,874
﻿But they don't understand shit about it.

384
00:40:48,886 --> 00:40:52,639
For Russians, an idea is more
important than money.

385
00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:00,279
﻿Give them an idea and they're willing
to work for free. Just for the idea.

386
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,839
﻿I think you're worried about nothing.

387
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:10,879
﻿First of all, the Russians
are only here for two weeks.

388
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,159
﻿Second, they don't know
our country, our nature.

389
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,679
﻿They've never fought in the
jungle. They can't handle militants.

390
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,399
﻿That's the little things.

391
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,759
﻿That's not what you're talking about, General.

392
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,079
﻿Do you know who Lenin is? Do you see the sign?

393
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,519
﻿I do.

394
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,079
﻿It's a Russian. Communist.

395
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,679
﻿There are streets named
after Russians in your country.

396
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,239
﻿Think about it.

397
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,919
﻿Think about it. They're dangerous.

398
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,799
CABO DELGADO PROVINCE
10 KM FROM MBAO VILLAGE

399
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,319
﻿Well, the situation is clear.
They fell a tree, set up an ambush.

400
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,559
﻿- Knew the locals would be here.
- And it looks like they knew beforehand.

401
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,559
The news is not good: they
have DShK and RPG now.

402
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,439
- "Granite" to "Baikal".
- On the line!

403
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,399
﻿- Start the chopper.
- Copy.

404
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,599
Did you see that?

405
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,199
﻿Maybe that's their tactic.

406
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,519
﻿Well, the quad can't help us here.

407
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,839
﻿Give me the lighter.

408
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,279
We'll have to walk with our
feet. How far to the village?

409
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:30,679
It's about 10 kilometers.
It's better to go by car.

410
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,239
﻿No, you can see and hear the car.

411
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,079
﻿If the insurgents are around,
we'll give ourselves away.

412
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,319
﻿We could be walking into an ambush. We're
moving through the jungle along the river.

413
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:56,399
The Major wants to stay
here to guard the cars.

414
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,879
Somehow that's what I immediately thought.

415
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,319
﻿And I'd like to go with you.

416
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,039
﻿Are you sure? There won't
be anybody to guard the cars.

417
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,199
I'm sure.

418
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,399
﻿Good.

419
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,879
﻿Hey, rattlesnake!

420
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,079
﻿I'm tired.

421
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:28,199
﻿Can we take a breather?

422
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,839
﻿Come on, we're not even halfway there.

423
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,879
﻿It's very hard.

424
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,599
﻿Okay, you just sit here and rest.
We'll pick you up on the way back.

425
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,199
﻿Are you kidding me? You can't
walk that long. It doesn't work that way.

426
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,519
It happens, it happens. Sure it does.

427
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,199
﻿Forsage, Bumblebee, stay and watch.

428
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,439
Roger.

429
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,919
﻿You just wait for me. And I'll be back.
Just keep waiting.
-

430
00:44:54,008 --> 00:44:55,639
Okay.

431
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,359
﻿Mom.

432
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,039
﻿Grandpa.

433
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,199
﻿I'm your father now! I'm your family!

434
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,919
﻿I'm your father now! I'm your family!

435
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,199
Here.

436
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,319
Cover me.

437
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,439
﻿- I got it!
- I got it!

438
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,759
﻿Go!

439
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,319
﻿I got it.

440
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,679
﻿- I got it!
- Go!

441
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,479
Go!

442
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,799
﻿I got it. Go!

443
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,559
[in Portuguese] Soviets...

444
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,759
He says he knows who you are.

445
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:22,399
﻿What do you mean?

446
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:27,239
[in Portuguese] That's you.

447
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:35,039
﻿So, these look like our guys
that served here in Mozambique.

448
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,199
﻿- Do you remember when that plane crashed?
- Yeah, I remember, I remember.

449
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,559
[in Portuguese] That's
my grandfather right there.

450
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,559
﻿And I think that's you.

451
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,759
﻿Yes?

452
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,719
﻿And that's you. Right?

453
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,759
﻿And that's you.

454
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,039
﻿I got it.

455
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,399
﻿We all look the same to him.

456
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,439
﻿Yeah.

457
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,919
﻿He says his grandfather told him about you.

458
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,799
﻿Says he prayed to God and you came.

459
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,079
﻿Soviets...

460
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,639
﻿Soviets...

461
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,804
﻿Listen, comrade, maybe
you know something about

462
00:51:24,816 --> 00:51:27,959
the militants who attacked your village, huh?

463
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,079
﻿They killed his whole family.

464
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:43,439
Tough. Well, listen, maybe you
know where they're hiding now?

465
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:47,399
﻿No, no.

466
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,119
﻿Hey, amigo!

467
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,959
﻿There's something you're not telling me, kid.

468
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,959
﻿Come on, guys, don't push
the kid. He'll tell you later.

469
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,839
﻿Let's go, let's go! You
can stay at our base for now.

470
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,759
﻿Wait, he forgot his picture.

471
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,079
﻿Stop it! Stop it!

472
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,239
Ribbon, stop for a moment.

473
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,639
﻿Jose wants to go out.

474
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,839
﻿- Hey!
- Hey, where are you going?

475
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,199
﻿Oh, come on...

476
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,159
﻿Hey, where are you going?

477
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,679
﻿- Kid!
- Boy!

478
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,199
﻿- Are we gonna catch up?
- Stop, men! What if it's a setup?

479
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,199
﻿- Weird kid.
- I agree.

480
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,159
﻿Let's go back.

481
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,399
MOCIMBOA DA PRAIA

482
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,839
﻿Sounds like we have a local fan.

483
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,079
﻿Black Jeep in the back.

484
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,439
﻿I noticed it the last time I saw it.

485
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,079
﻿Attention, convoy! We got a tail!

486
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,319
He followed us and filmed us!

487
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,519
﻿We should check the car and the phone!

488
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,279
﻿Sit down!

489
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,159
﻿Says you made a mistake.

490
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:59,599
﻿He's a simple citizen, he
didn't do anything illegal.

491
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:06,399
The General says you are very suspicious.

492
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:08,479
﻿It's just a civilian.

493
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,719
﻿А... a civilian.

494
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,679
﻿Okay.

495
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,839
﻿Well, tell him it's gonna be
okay, so he doesn't have to worry.

496
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,399
Stingray! Go get the battery from his car.

497
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,839
﻿Oh, and by the way,
don't forget the alligator clips.

498
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,799
﻿Ask him if he has any chronic illnesses.

499
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,479
﻿Is there anything wrong with his heart?

500
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,599
﻿- He's very sick!
- OK.

501
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,879
﻿Let him take his shirt off.

502
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,639
Where, where are you going?

503
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,719
﻿- See, they're talking.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!

504
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,679
﻿You have no right to torture our citizen.

505
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,239
﻿See, he says he'll tell
you everything he knows.

506
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,639
﻿That's the way it should
have been a long time ago.

507
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:02,839
﻿Who asked you to follow us?

508
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,039
﻿Why were you filming us with your phone?

509
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,680
﻿Who were you carrying the guns to, and why

510
00:55:06,692 --> 00:55:08,519
were you carrying a
grenade launcher in the car?

511
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:13,839
[in Portuguese] General!

512
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,959
﻿The Russians got our man. I'm afraid
he's going to tell them everything.

513
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:30,199
[in Portuguese] Luis! Luis! I'm right here!

514
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,319
﻿How did you get here?

515
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,479
﻿Run away!

516
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,479
﻿Remember, my grandfather
told me about the Soviets?

517
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,799
﻿- They're here again!
- What kind of nonsense is that?

518
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,919
﻿- Who's here?
- The Soviets! We gotta go!

519
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,999
﻿These people are dead!

520
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,439
﻿No, I'm telling you!

521
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,199
﻿They're here and they're
looking for these bandits!

522
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,679
﻿And they might kill you.

523
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:58,119
﻿We have to run...

524
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:06,039
Musa, the boys got away! We gotta go get them!

525
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,639
﻿They can't get away!

526
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,279
﻿Hurry, hurry!

527
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:19,759
﻿Get up! Luis, get up! We gotta go!

528
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,399
﻿Your prisoner said the
militant camp is located here.

529
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,559
﻿Can you get across the river here?

530
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,159
﻿No, no. That's impossible! It's a deep river!

531
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:04,279
﻿I see. So it's not an option.

532
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,950
﻿All right, let's move out,
confirm camp location,

533
00:57:07,962 --> 00:57:10,999
work the 120 mm mortars,
go in, clear it, that's it.

534
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,759
﻿Yeah... If their 120mm even fire at all.

535
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,319
﻿- Two mortars are working.
- You see, it's not so bad.

536
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:20,559
﻿Two out of 30. It's like a
sports lottery or something.

537
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,879
It's fine. It's okay.

538
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:29,839
﻿Waiting confirmation from the Granite group.

539
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,919
﻿Granite to Lemon. A sentry.

540
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,199
﻿Right up in the tree.

541
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:39,519
﻿Kuban's with me, the rest are in place.

542
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,719
Copy.

543
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,959
﻿Go!

544
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,999
﻿Let's go back.

545
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,639
﻿Mortars are canceled.

546
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,999
﻿What happened, why?

547
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,319
﻿The kid they picked up at church yesterday.

548
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,639
﻿He's in the cage, tied
up, I guess he got caught.

549
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,300
﻿If we use mortars, you know,
we'll blow him up too.

550
01:00:51,312 --> 01:00:54,839
Are you ready to take
it upon yourself? I am not.

551
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,999
﻿Andrei, are you all right in the head?

552
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,799
﻿Is that your son? I don't remember
any local kids in your biography.

553
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,079
﻿- Listen...
- No, you listen!

554
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,239
﻿I didn't like this whole storming
thing from the beginning.

555
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,879
﻿It's a decoy! It's a setup!

556
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,039
﻿What if there's more civilians in there?

557
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,879
﻿You want to fight, fight.
I won't stop you from it.

558
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,999
﻿But you're putting your people at
risk because of some kid on the street.

559
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:25,639
﻿Need I remind you of the
three-to-one ratio on the offensive?

560
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,119
﻿And the likely percentage of casualties, hmm?

561
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,119
﻿It doesn't work in the jungle.

562
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:38,199
﻿Listen, Pasik, if we fought by
textbooks, we'd all be dead by now.

563
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,919
﻿I'm for assault without mortars, too.

564
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:44,439
﻿Fuck you... Mortars are canceled.

565
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,679
﻿Civilians could get hurt.

566
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:02,519
﻿Maybe you Russians are
willing to risk your fighters.

567
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:04,519
﻿But I'm not.

568
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:09,759
﻿Well, we'll ask them now. Let's go translate.

569
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,039
﻿Well, you're not going
either? Are you scared?

570
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:23,999
﻿Fear is normal. Everybody's scared. Always.

571
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,719
﻿Before the fight, too.

572
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:34,119
﻿But you can only win
if you conquer your fear.

573
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:44,319
﻿And to make a long story short, boys.
In war, it's not the guns that decide, it's the balls!

574
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,879
﻿The one with the toughest balls wins.

575
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,239
Well, is anyone coming, or
are you going straight home?

576
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:26,999
﻿The Major says you can go
wherever you want, they stay here.

577
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:30,919
﻿Well, that's right. Somebody's
got to guard the mortars, right?

578
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,359
﻿By the way, comrade, may I borrow some
coke for the cause of revolution from you?

579
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,599
All right, come on. That's it, take it all!

580
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,879
Andrei, what do you need Coca-Cola for?

581
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,999
﻿I got an idea.

582
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:12,879
﻿Watch this, men.

583
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,839
﻿We're approaching in a group from the east.

584
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,279
﻿When we find the camp, we split up.

585
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,079
﻿My group on the right,
Kubic's group on the left.

586
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,279
﻿Their retreat will probably be
to the southwest, along the river.

587
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,079
﻿And that's where Pasik's
group will be waiting for them.

588
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,119
﻿We'd better keep the allies in
check, or they won't leave us any work.

589
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,519
﻿I open fire first and
that's the signal to assault.

590
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:53,799
﻿We'll try to approach as quietly as possible,
so we'll load up the silencers.

591
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,679
﻿And remember, vanity is
the sister of you know what.

592
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,879
﻿Concrete, cover me.

593
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:53,479
﻿We'll slow down the enemy
here if they go for the allies.

594
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,519
﻿Kubic in position.

595
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:19,639
﻿- Kuban group in position.
- Copy.

596
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:50,719
﻿How are you?

597
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,719
Alive!

598
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,399
﻿Where to! Freeze!

599
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,119
Hey, get back, get back!

600
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:47,359
﻿Alive.

601
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:48,559
Alive, alive!

602
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,239
"Granite" to "Pasik".

603
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:57,199
﻿- Copy.
- There are 40 insurgents heading toward the river.

604
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:58,199
﻿Fuck.

605
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:03,679
﻿And our dear General said it was
too deep and impossible to cross.

606
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:37,559
﻿So, Slavka! How are we doing?

If you don't yell, there will be progress.

609
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,959
﻿All right, all right, I won't get in the way.

610
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,119
﻿You ran away from us because of your brother?

611
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:08,559
﻿He was afraid that you would go and kill the
militants and kill his brother,

612
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:11,439
but his brother is not a militant.

613
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:18,159
They took them out of the village, he
ran away and his brother stayed behind.

614
01:10:18,240 --> 01:10:19,439
﻿It wasn't his fault.

615
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,119
﻿Why are you guys so excited?

616
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,119
﻿He'll live.

617
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,439
﻿Happily ever after.

618
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:33,639
﻿Well... you should have just said so.

619
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:35,839
﻿It's okay.

620
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,159
﻿No, later.

621
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,559
Andrei, do you want to be honest?

622
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,199
﻿I don't even know why we came here.

623
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,639
﻿If we hadn't come, somebody else would have.

624
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,879
﻿And those others just don't give
a damn about the local population.

625
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:30,439
﻿But you see, those other
natives don't give a rat's ass either.

626
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,399
﻿They'd sell the country
for a capful of breadcrumbs!

627
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:37,439
﻿Do you want to make them love
their country? That's impossible!

628
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,799
﻿No, I can't make them do it.

629
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,599
You can teach then.

630
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,279
﻿Andrei... stop it already.

631
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:56,679
﻿I don't want to.

[in Portuguese] Commander, I need a doctor.

635
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,559
﻿I don't want to die, commander!

636
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,319
﻿You know I can't help you now.

637
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:08,567
﻿You have failed in your task,
commander.

638
01:13:08,579 --> 01:13:12,839
The Russians wiped out your camp
and more than half your fighters.

639
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:23,799
﻿Tell your boss we're
going to rectify the situation.

640
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,519
I don't think you can do that.

641
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,619
﻿Now, Mamudo, listen to me very carefully.

642
01:13:32,631 --> 01:13:36,919
From now on you will obey this
man, his name is Omar.

643
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,839
﻿He will be your commanding officer.
And together you will destroy the Russians.

644
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:53,319
[in English] There are only thirty of them.

645
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,359
﻿But that's thirty professionals.

646
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,959
﻿I can do it myself.

647
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,799
﻿This is an order.

﻿SUDAN. RUSSIAN MILITARY BASE IN SUDAN
Gazik, why the fuck did you even go to the camp, huh?

649
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,919
﻿What did I tell you? What was your mission?

650
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,999
﻿To study the situation
and train the local fighters.

651
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,679
﻿- Well, it was decided.
- Who decided? Granite?

652
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,319
﻿Well, it was our joint decision.

653
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,759
﻿Stop defending Granite.

654
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:27,879
﻿I don't need you guys playing heroes.

655
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,039
﻿No one's playing heroes. Just working.

656
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:35,719
﻿- All right, what's the result?
- We killed about 40 fighters.

657
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:40,119
﻿- And an equal number more went down.
- Good job, what can I say. All right.

658
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,639
﻿I'll be there tomorrow.
We'll figure it out on the spot.

659
01:14:43,664 --> 01:14:47,063
﻿Don't do anything until I get there, okay?

660
01:14:47,932 --> 01:14:49,931
﻿- Copy.
- Copy, over.

661
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,386
[in Arabic] There are
three villages here-Mbao,

662
01:14:55,398 --> 01:14:59,679
Limalo and Seta. We have to
lure the Russians here in Limalo.

663
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,119
﻿We'll set some houses on fire in the village.

664
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,919
﻿When the Russians come up, we'll meet them.

665
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:12,759
[in Portuguese] I would
have done things differently.

666
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,559
﻿I would wait for the
Russians at this intersection.

667
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:22,919
[in Arabic] I didn't ask you.

668
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,279
﻿You and your men can go home
and wait for the Russians there.

669
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:41,639
[in Portuguese] You think
you are a great commander?

670
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:45,119
﻿I hear you. You do it
your way. I'll do it my way.

671
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:07,008
﻿I suggest we get some
local fighters to patrol the

672
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:10,919
road while we go through
the jungle in a few groups.

673
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,879
﻿What makes you think
they'll come out to the road?

674
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,559
They won't be able to
sit in the jungle for long.

675
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:21,894
﻿And on the road is the best
way to move. The insurgents

676
01:16:21,906 --> 01:16:24,679
got wounded, the
nearest hospital is in Marere.

677
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,239
﻿I suggest we use Pamir's group.

678
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,879
There are already local fighters.
What's the use of them?

679
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,915
﻿It's not that bad. In the case of the
hospital, we're better off with our own forces.

680
01:16:33,927 --> 01:16:38,039
If the insurgents go after
the locals, they'll screw them over.

681
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:42,199
﻿- You're not worried about your guys?
- I'm sure about my guys.

682
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:44,879
﻿Shall we go see the general?

683
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,119
﻿Thank you.

684
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,879
﻿Wow. Cool.

685
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,919
﻿MARERE. CITY HOSPITAL.

686
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,239
﻿That's weird, where are the people, huh?

687
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:18,959
﻿Cornerstone to the right.
Zenith - straight ahead. Forward.

688
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:02,199
﻿It looks like everything's in place,
nothing's been touched, but people are gone.

689
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,919
That's weird.

690
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,439
﻿Ah, there you are.

691
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,519
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy. Give me that.

692
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,279
﻿Well, cheers.

693
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,479
﻿Hey, everybody. I see smoke at three o'clock.

694
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:05,199
﻿Local people are leaving the villages.
There are two accesses to this village.

695
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:06,959
﻿We divide into two groups.

696
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:10,557
﻿Pasik and Kuban, you come
up from the main road with

697
01:19:10,569 --> 01:19:14,359
the Allies, and we'll come up the other side.
- Copy.

698
01:19:22,678 --> 01:19:27,022
LIMALO VILLAGE

699
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,755
I can feel it in my ass, they're
waiting for us. Let's turn around

700
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:51,567
and leave them with a surprise,
prepare the machine gun.

701
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:53,519
Come on.

702
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:16,319
EASTERN EDGE OF THE LIMALO VILLAGE

703
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,959
[in Arabic] You two.

704
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:09,799
﻿Go check out what's going on over there.

705
01:21:11,197 --> 01:21:15,478
WESTERN EDGE OF THE LIMALO VILLAGE

706
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,239
Well, men, here we go.

707
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,679
[in Portuguese] We were told to go home.

708
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:30,679
﻿But today we're going
to celebrate our victory.

709
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,399
﻿We don't care who wins in this village.

710
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:36,559
﻿They fight among themselves,
and we will meet them here.

711
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,119
﻿Are you ready to avenge our brothers?

712
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:40,479
Yes, commander!

713
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,639
﻿Clear.

714
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:00,599
Granite!

715
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,879
﻿- Copy.
- All in one piece, men?

716
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,159
We are!

717
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,919
﻿- Pasik!
- Yes.

718
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,239
﻿Good.

719
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,159
﻿Check all the buildings.
Come in from the east.

720
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,919
[in Portuguese] Halt. Halt!

721
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:51,239
﻿So? Congratulations on your victory.

722
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:00,319
Tell your men to check the
bodies, IDs, weapons, and so on.

723
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:10,439
﻿And we're going to the base.
Gazik. Let's go, men, it's all here.

724
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:17,879
﻿Well guys, well done. We did it
without a loss. Time to go home.

﻿Ah, fuck.

748
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:36,399
- Listening.
- What's the situation over there?

749
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,199
Steadily tense.
We got stuck a little bit.

750
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:43,799
﻿- Went back from Limalo, got ambushed.
- Great. Any casualties?

﻿- No one was killed.
- Wounded?

752
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,448
I can't say for sure. No
heavy, five wounded so far:

753
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:52,999
Lemon, Tobol, Bumblebee, Baikal and Granite.

754

﻿- Shot.
- What took you so long?

773
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:19,279
﻿- Well, sorry, traffic lights.
- That's a compelling reason.

774
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,959
"Granite" to "Pasik." Are you okay?

775
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:25,439

﻿- There's something wrong with him.

01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:43,159
﻿Damn it. You should be in the hospital, man.

779
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:45,839
﻿I'm fine, I'll just catch my
breath and be on my way.

780
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,839
﻿Look at me, Granite.

781
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,759
Stingray to Pasik. Get the car here, quick.

782
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:06,479
﻿- Granite is seriously wounded.
- Copy.

783
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:24,159
Great job, guys.

784
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,959
﻿Pasik to Grey. How copy?

785
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,479
Copy. On approach. Granite is with us.

786
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:38,759
﻿- Give me Granite.
- He can't talk yet.

787
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:42,239
﻿- Alive, heavily wounded.
- What's the nature of the wounds?

788
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:46,279
﻿Hand, two to the chest and
the femoral artery is severed.

789
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:49,799
﻿- Take it out.
- We'll try.

790
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:59,119
[in Portuguese] And I
know it's gonna be okay now.

791
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:03,279
﻿The Soviets, they're like
gods. I knew they would save us.

792
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,159
﻿They come down from heaven
and defeat all the fighters.

793
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:12,119
﻿Grandpa was right, he was telling me
about the Soviets and I didn't believe him.

794
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:49,759
﻿We found the wounded fighter
outside the hospital in Marere.

795
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:55,799
﻿He told us about the ambush.
We were almost there in time.

796
01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:59,879
﻿Lost a lot of blood. Artery's severed.

797
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,959
﻿This sucks, guys. We were a little late.

798
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:26,302
﻿Message from Granite. It just
came in. "Borisych, we got in a bit

799
01:32:26,314 --> 01:32:32,159
of a jam on the way to Mueda.
Worked out fine. See you tonight."

800
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:34,479
So now we meet, Andrei.

801
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,359
Probably have to let his
loved ones know somehow.

802
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:43,119
Everyone close to him is already here.

803
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:51,719
See you around.

804
01:32:55,383 --> 01:32:57,615
MAPUTO

805
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:04,032
[in English] The Russians are running
out of time today. They are leaving.

806
01:33:04,044 --> 01:33:07,199
I have already talked to the management,

807
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:10,519
I convinced them that the
Russians will be of little use.

808
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:14,159
﻿So I hope they don't come here again.

809
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:16,359
That's good news.

810
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:22,999
﻿What do you plan to do next? Mamudo
and Omar's groups have been destroyed.

811
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:32,119
﻿I don't see the problem. We will assemble
new groups that will solve our problems.

812
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:52,839
Major is very grateful for your help.

813
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:57,839
﻿And he says you've taught us a lot.

814
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:08,973
﻿Major says the main group of militants
in Cabo Delgado has been eliminated.

815
01:34:08,985 --> 01:34:13,679
And he's confident that our
soldiers won't be afraid of the enemy.

816
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:30,919
﻿Well, boys, let's go back to Sudan.

817
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,479
﻿Then to Russia. Try to get some rest.

818
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,919
Good.

819
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,679
﻿In a month's time, a business trip.

820
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:39,759
Don't piss yourself, guys.

821
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,439
[in Portuguese] Thank you, Soviets.

822
01:35:38,388 --> 01:35:48,970
IN NOVEMBER 2019, RUSSIAN INSTRUCTORS LEFT MOZAMBIQUE, AFTER WHICH MILITANTS OF THE ANSAR
AL-SUNNA GROUP (BANNED IN THE RF) CONTINUED TO ATTACK VILLAGES AND TOWNS IN CABO DELGADO PROVINCE.

823
01:35:48,971 --> 01:35:58,570
THE ARMED FORCES OF MOZAMBIQUE DETACHMENT, TRAINED BY THE GRANITE GROUP, WAS COMPLETELY WIPED OUT IN
MARCH 2021. THE SOLDIERS OF THE DETACHMENT DIED HEROICALLY DEFENDING THE CITY OF PALMA FROM THE MILITANTS.
