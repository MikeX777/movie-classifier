1
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,954
Oh, she's a beauty.

2
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:39,588
I mean, look at her.
She's not new, but she looks new.

3
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:42,804
- He said the engine needed work.
- I could do the engine.

4
00:01:42,886 --> 00:01:45,601
I can't believe he's asking so little.
It's practically a steal.

5
00:01:45,684 --> 00:01:48,272
John Anderson said we could
keep it at his marina free of charge...

6
00:01:48,398 --> 00:01:50,361
at least for a year
till his son comes back.

7
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:53,742
Oh, here he comes. Don't show you're
too eager or he won't budge on the price.

8
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:55,371
- All right?
- Right.

9
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:58,376
Ain't she a beauty? A little work
and she'll be in perfect condition.

10
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:01,591
Yeah, well, let's face it. It's more
than a little work she needs, isn't it?

11
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:03,595
What's the best price
you can do us?

12
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:07,353
- A boat like this is worth every bit of 6,000.
- Six grand? Are you joking?

13
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:12,237
Six is a bargain. The owner died
and his mum's got to get rid of it fast.

14
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,119
All right, but the engine's done
and the hull needs work as well.

15
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,331
She could be made seaworthy
in no time.

16
00:02:17,415 --> 00:02:20,378
Take a look at the condition she's in.
Practically mint.

17
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:22,924
Look, we're just working lads.
We don't have this kind of money.

18
00:02:22,966 --> 00:02:26,223
To get a SCOD like this for six
is a once-in-a-lifetime.

19
00:02:26,307 --> 00:02:30,566
- Look, can you give us a minute?
Just give us a minute. Terry.

20
00:02:30,602 --> 00:02:30,899
- What?

21
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:33,989
There's plenty of others
interested in her if you're not.

22
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:43,300
I could put in 800. Christ, you break
your back and it's hard to save a penny.

23
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:45,596
- Where you'd get 800 quid from?
- I won 400 at cards.

24
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,600
- Did you?
- Yeah.

25
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:49,604
Come on, you got
some savings, Ian.

26
00:02:49,686 --> 00:02:52,109
But I'm trying to get my end
of a business deal up.

27
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,827
I could match your 800, but I promised Dad
I'd take a pay cut 'cause business is so bad.

28
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,123
Bet if Uncle Howard was here
he'd loan it to us.

29
00:02:59,165 --> 00:03:03,131
- Yeah, I thought of that. But he's away.
- They must have phones in China.

30
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:05,135
- It's like Howard's boat, isn't it?
- Yeah.

31
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,312
I mean, it's smaller, but it's so much better
a nick than I thought we could afford.

32
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:13,152
Remember when we were kids?

33
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,906
- Uncle Howard bought us that boat in Ireland?
- Oh, yeah.

34
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,328
- What a summer.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:23,714
I've got to have this boat.
We could pay it off in installments.

36
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:26,428
I got four numbers in the lottery
last week. Can you believe four?

37
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:29,810
- Should we do it? Right.
- Yeah, let's do it.

38
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:33,316
What the hell do you need a boat for?
And how are you gonna pay for it?

39
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,905
- It's secondhand.
- So you're buying someone else's headaches.

40
00:03:35,988 --> 00:03:38,951
No, we're doing an incredible job
fixing it up. You ought to see it.

41
00:03:39,077 --> 00:03:40,997
It's cleaning up like new.

42
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:44,171
Pay more attention to the restaurant
and less to dreams of the open sea.

43
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:46,718
You're a bright boy if your head
wasn't always in the clouds.

44
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,804
I wasn't put on this earth
to run a restaurant.

45
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:52,647
Remember when Uncle Howard bought me
and Ian that boat when we were kids?

46
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:53,272
What a summer.

47
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:56,320
Your Uncle Howard's
opening a clinic in China.

48
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,324
He's studying
the Chinese language.

49
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:01,331
Can you imagine at his age
learning a hard language like that?

50
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,835
- He's brilliant.
- I'm unimpressed.

51
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,550
You can't afford to be
unimpressed...

52
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:10,432
because the man makes more money
in a week than you earn in a year.

53
00:04:10,473 --> 00:04:14,691
He's got clinics in Switzerland
and Hollywood, and now China.

54
00:04:14,732 --> 00:04:19,117
Hollywood's where he belongs. All those phonies
lining up like sheep for his plastic surgery.

55
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,875
Mom, can we have one Sunday lunch
where we don't have this conversation?

56
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:26,213
Well, puts on airs,
takes himself so seriously.

57
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:29,721
Could we have afforded this house
without my brother's generosity?

58
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:33,604
Could we have got by over the years
on his paltry earnings?

59
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,649
I mean, who paid
for the holidays?

60
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:40,451
Who lent us the money when we needed it,
when he wanted to start his restaurant?

61
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:43,833
If my bloody partner didn't steal from me-
That's what gave me the heart attack.

62
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:48,091
Howard started with nothing and he paid
his own way through his medical studies.

63
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:50,679
And now he's a millionaire
with top-class clients...

64
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:53,059
and yet he never
forgot his family.

65
00:04:53,184 --> 00:04:55,063
Let that be a lesson to you.

66
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:59,196
In the end, all you have in this
life that you can count on is family.

67
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,241
And don't you forget it.

68
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:08,714
- I got us the rest of the money.
- What?

69
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:12,889
We can pay off the boat. Plus, some left over for
the barometer you wanted to buy for the cabin.

70
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:14,894
- How?
- Two of my little doggies came in.

71
00:05:14,936 --> 00:05:17,984
- No.
- Yep. First and fifth race, I won both.

72
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,491
We can finish by the weekend. We can
take her out for a maiden voyage Saturday.

73
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:25,206
What are we going to call her? We have to
call her something if we're taking her out.

74
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:29,173
- Cassandra's Dream. That
was the 60-to-1 shot I hit.

75
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:30,300
- 60-to-1?
Terry.

76
00:05:30,383 --> 00:05:32,722
Yeah. It's a lucky name.

77
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:37,236
Have a good weekend.

78
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:40,236
Do you want to come out for
a ride on Cassandra's Dream?

79
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:41,537
What's Cassandra's Dream?

80
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:44,083
My brother and I bought this
beat-up boat and fixed it up.

81
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:49,255
We're going out on it tomorrow. And he's taking
his girl and I wondered if you'd like to come?

82
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:53,597
- Yeah, I'd love to. Sounds good.
- The weather's meant to be great.

83
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:24,491
#Wherever I may roam #

84
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:28,124
- #Through land or sea or foam #
- Oh, nice harmony.

85
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:31,923
- #You will always hear me singing this song #
- # Ba da boo #

86
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:34,637
- # Show me the way to go home #
- # Ba ba ba #

87
00:06:34,721 --> 00:06:37,017
# Show me the way to go home #

88
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:39,022
# I'm tired and I want to go to bed #

89
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:42,486
# I had a little drink about an hour ago
and it's gone right to my head #

90
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,490
- Ohh!
- #Wherever I may roam #

91
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:46,494
#Through land or sea or foam #

92
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:49,125
#You will always hear me
singing this song #

93
00:06:49,207 --> 00:06:53,592
# Show me the way to go home ##

94
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:57,015
Nice one. I'll drink to that.

95
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:02,401
Gee, ain't life grand?
You know where that's from? What movie?

96
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:04,697
- Ain't Life Grand, no?
- Bonnie and Clyde.

97
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:09,874
Two Barrow brothers having a fine time
and Clyde says, "Ain't life grand?"

98
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:13,465
You know what happened to them?

99
00:07:13,549 --> 00:07:15,469
Do you think life is grand, Kate?

100
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:18,433
- I think it's grand when I'm around you, yeah.
- Ahh. What an answer.

101
00:07:18,517 --> 00:07:22,776
What an answer! What can I say?
The woman loves me.

102
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:24,779
Love you too, babes.

103
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,701
I'll tell you something. I never want
to go back to that stupid restaurant.

104
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:30,002
Oh, what do you want, Ian?

105
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,338
Do you remember when Mum
took us to visit Uncle Howard in California?

106
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:35,801
- How he lived his life?
- Oh, yeah.

107
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:38,557
I never let myself have dreams like that.
I mean, what's the point?

108
00:07:38,597 --> 00:07:41,563
Well, I mean, it breaks my heart
to see Dad the way he is...

109
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:44,735
but as soon as he's back on his feet,
I've got to get out.

110
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,323
- I've got to make a life of my own.
- Out where?

111
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,206
Well, some friends of mine
invested in some hotels in California.

112
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:53,253
- California?
- So I might join them.

113
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:55,925
- It's a nice day as well.
- It's a long way from England, darling.

114
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,931
- Not too many clouds. Just right.
- Isn't it?

115
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:02,563
See, there's a pool with the cabanas here,
and there's a nine-hole golf course.

116
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:04,609
This is a great-looking property.

117
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,698
Nothing's going to happen until the end
of the year, but I'm telling you, mate...

118
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,289
- whoever invests in this is gonna make a fortune.
- Now I can see the potential.

119
00:08:11,372 --> 00:08:15,296
There's one in the Caribbean,
the one in California has got a spa.

120
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:18,220
- So I'll keep you up to speed, yeah?
- Yeah.

121
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:21,392
Hey, where were you
when we were doing it?

122
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:24,857
- Why?
- Your mind was somewhere else.

123
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:28,740
It's this property development thing,
and it's gonna upset my dad.

124
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:30,745
But the years are passing.

125
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:34,878
You are so full of stress
all the time, even in bed.

126
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:37,384
The only time I've seen you relax
is on your boat.

127
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:39,720
Mmm. Terry's taking the boat
out tomorrow.

128
00:08:39,805 --> 00:08:45,148
He's taking Kate's sister and brother out for
a sail. Wouldn't have much fun with them.

129
00:08:45,231 --> 00:08:50,575
But I was wondering whether you'd maybe like
to come out to the country for the day with me.

130
00:08:50,659 --> 00:08:52,997
- Yeah, I would. I know a really nice lake.
- Yeah?

131
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,334
We could maybe borrow a car
from Terry's garage.

132
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:58,090
The guy there sometimes
lends him the classic cars.

133
00:08:58,132 --> 00:09:02,099
- Have you ever made love outside?
- Well, there's a first time for everything.

134
00:10:07,353 --> 00:10:09,734
I think I should go back and help.

135
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:35,786
I'll just be back in a minute.

136
00:10:37,372 --> 00:10:42,006
Oh, I can't drink this much red wine
in the daytime. It goes to my head.

137
00:10:45,222 --> 00:10:47,852
- Can I help?
- Thank you. I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

138
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,190
I know a little bit about cars.
My brother fixes them.

139
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:54,992
Well, it was running smoothly and then there was
just this big bang and it sort of petered out.

140
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:57,036
Let me have a look.

141
00:11:00,502 --> 00:11:02,507
All right.

142
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:05,470
Yeah.

143
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,618
There you are.
They can be a bit temperamental.

144
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,205
Yeah, I love yours.

145
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:22,963
Ah, yeah, it's very pretty,
isn't it? I haven't had it long.

146
00:11:23,047 --> 00:11:26,261
Old Jags are so sexy.

147
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:28,975
- Well, thank you for stopping.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

148
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:31,773
- I'm Angela Stark.
- Ian Blaine.

149
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:33,902
- Do you live around here?
- No. I live in London.

150
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,907
Yeah, me too.
What do you do?

151
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:38,870
At the moment, I'm in the restaurant
business, but basically, uh, investments.

152
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:42,211
I owe you one. I'm leaving you
a couple of tickets to my show.

153
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:43,338
Oh, you're an actress?

154
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,552
- Yeah. What's your name?
- Ian Blaine.

155
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:49,642
Okay, I'll leave you two tickets
at the Wilton. When do you want to come?

156
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:52,147
- Uh, Tuesday?
- Fine.

157
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:52,403
Yeah.

158
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:54,902
Don't forget to come backstage
and tell me how great I am.

159
00:11:54,985 --> 00:11:56,864
All right.

160
00:11:56,991 --> 00:12:01,249
Oh, look, this is Terry
and Ian and my brother Howard.

161
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:04,506
- Oh, let's see.
- Oh, Howard looks so handsome.

162
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:08,638
Uh, that was the year Howard took
the boys to see the World Cup match.

163
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:10,642
I used to be a very good football player.

164
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:12,646
He was till he broke his leg.

165
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:15,361
I always hoped Terry would take to it.
You were very good.

166
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:19,411
He excelled at sports.
I always said you should open a sports shop.

167
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:22,417
Yeah, but I need financial backing.
Costs a lot to own a shop.

168
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:24,421
Then you'd be your own boss,
wouldn't you?

169
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:27,259
Yeah, Terry was athletic
and Ian was-

170
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:29,513
- The brains, she wants to say. Yeah.
- No.

171
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:31,517
She thinks I'll be
offended by it. Great.

172
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:33,729
Everybody predicted
great things for Ian.

173
00:12:33,813 --> 00:12:36,027
- He's so nice-looking and personable.
- Yeah.

174
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:39,158
Now it's a mystery to me
why he's not more successful.

175
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,286
Because he's not content
with what he has.

176
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:43,708
He sees himself like Howard,
with a fancy life.

177
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:47,340
Always got some scheme.
Always waiting for his ship to come in.

178
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:51,474
Well, his ship won't come in at the restaurant.
He does that out of a son's love for his father.

179
00:12:51,557 --> 00:12:56,192
Like the poet said: " The only ship
certain to come in has black sails."

180
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,624
Go on!

181
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,879
Go on!

182
00:13:06,922 --> 00:13:09,678
Come on! Ahh!

183
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:13,268
Go on- Ohh! Shit!

184
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,276
Oh, lend us another
couple of hundred.

185
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,367
- That's eight.
- I know. I can count.

186
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:28,089
- Hello.
- Hello, babe.

187
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:31,096
- You met me from work.
- Yeah.

188
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:34,226
- You're too gorgeous.
- I got you something.

189
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,314
- No.
- Go on.

190
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:40,615
You didn't.
Oh, my God!

191
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:43,871
- Oh, wow. You're too naughty.
- Do you like it?

192
00:13:43,913 --> 00:13:47,419
- Do I like it? That is beautiful.
- I wanted you to have it.

193
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:51,969
God. How much is that-
I'm not gonna even ask about the money...

194
00:13:52,054 --> 00:13:54,558
- 'cause I'm sure I know where you got it.
- You wouldn't believe.

195
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:57,731
- What?
- I was losing at first, and my luck changed.

196
00:13:57,773 --> 00:13:58,321
Oh, yeah?

197
00:13:58,358 --> 00:14:02,116
And I was in over me head, but
sometimes you get the feeling.

198
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:06,123
I can't even explain it. I know it's not
your birthday, but I thought you'd like it.

199
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:08,503
Oh, and I'm glad you did.
Oh, it's gorgeous. Thank you.

200
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:13,096
- You're welcome. How was work?
- Boring. Boring. But look at my bag.

201
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:16,310
My boyfriend doesn't have to know.

202
00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:19,150
- Know what?
- What we're going to do.

203
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:23,157
- What are we going to do?
- What do you want to do?

204
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:26,747
It's a very wicked way to cheat Alan.

205
00:14:26,789 --> 00:14:29,503
To deceive him so blatantly.

206
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:34,722
I never said I was nice. In fact, I think
that's why you're so turned on by me.

207
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:37,227
It's one of those nights, you know...

208
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:41,570
when those elements
just blend to perfection.

209
00:14:41,652 --> 00:14:44,993
- Angela. Uh, you were terrific.
- Oh, hi. Um, Ian.

210
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:47,790
- Fantastic. You were brilliant.
- Oh, thank you. Oh, well...

211
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:51,047
the director put in a scene at the last minute
and we were completely thrown off.

212
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,802
- It didn't show. I thought it was great.
- That's very sweet of you.

213
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:58,269
- All of you, great. Thanks for the tickets.
- Thank you for rescuing me.

214
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:00,984
I thought the play was brilliant.
You-You were very special in it.

215
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,028
- Special?
- Yeah, special.

216
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:06,452
Well, you know,
can I take you for a drink?

217
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:09,333
- On the way. Good.
- See you.

218
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,419
- Still on for Sunday night?
- Yeah, definitely.

219
00:15:11,504 --> 00:15:13,842
- Good. Can't wait.
- Um, sorry. What were you saying?

220
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:16,806
Uh, just wondered if you
wanted to come for a drink.

221
00:15:16,847 --> 00:15:20,272
Uh, yeah. Sure. I can only stay for one though.
I've got to be up early tomorrow.

222
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:23,151
I'm doing a film for the BBC.

223
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:26,032
Does it bother you coming
out nude onstage every night...

224
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:29,038
- and doing all the kinky sex scenes?
- That's only acting.

225
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:32,004
I'm not self-conscious
about that sort of thing.

226
00:15:32,045 --> 00:15:35,844
I mean, the whole point of my character
is to create an erotic tension.

227
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:39,518
You're very convincing.
The audience gets very quiet.

228
00:15:39,561 --> 00:15:42,524
I think it's a very moral play,
don't you think?

229
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:47,493
- Moral? In what way?
- Well, about evil, about fate.

230
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:50,666
I'm not an experienced playgoer.

231
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,338
I do think that the writing
is very pessimistic.

232
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:57,387
And all that stuff about life
being a tragic experience.

233
00:15:57,472 --> 00:16:00,227
I think we make our own fate.
I believe that.

234
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:01,854
Yeah, I think we make our fate too.

235
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:03,901
- Helen, this is Ian.
- Hello.

236
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:06,573
Hi. Ellis Pell asked me
for your phone number.

237
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:10,373
- And I didn't think you'd mind.
- Mind? Did he say when he might call?

238
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:13,754
If anything happens, I want the details.

239
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:18,389
Well, I should go. Thank you again
for coming to my aid on the road.

240
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,769
I dreamt about you
the next two nights.

241
00:16:21,852 --> 00:16:24,441
Being rescued is one
of my wicked dreams.

242
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,862
It's not very wicked
being rescued.

243
00:16:27,906 --> 00:16:30,578
It's what you did to me after.

244
00:16:32,081 --> 00:16:34,044
Will I see you again?

245
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:37,092
Well, you can try
now you know where to find me.

246
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:41,892
- Oi, Ter.
- Oi, Mike.

247
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:44,773
You all right?
You got my dough?

248
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:46,778
Yeah. Hang on a minute.

249
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:49,074
So I hear you've been
a bit lucky at cards lately.

250
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,997
It's not just cards. Backed
a lot of winners at the dogs.

251
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:52,415
Oh, yeah?

252
00:16:52,456 --> 00:16:54,418
- You know what my theory is?
- No. Go on.

253
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,217
It comes in streaks. Gotta be willing
to push your luck when it's hot.

254
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,388
Right.

255
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,313
So, uh, what's the most you're
willing to play for then?

256
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:07,069
What's the most?
I don't know. I'm for real.

257
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:10,576
I mean, I don't want to wind up
paying people back the rest of my life.

258
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:13,039
Vultures like you chasing me for money.

259
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:15,043
Why'd you ask?

260
00:17:15,126 --> 00:17:17,674
Well, there's a big game every
Friday night at the Alwyn Hotel.

261
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:19,678
- Do you know it?
- Yeah.

262
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,433
And it's big money, mate. I'm
not sure if you're up for it.

263
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:22,767
How much?

264
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,315
Well, put it this way, Sammy Bush
walked out with 60 grand last week.

265
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,319
Oh, too rich for my blood.

266
00:17:28,404 --> 00:17:31,618
Well, just thought, seeing as you were flush,
I thought you might be up for it.

267
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,291
- Sixty grand?
- Well, just thought I'd mention it, that's all.

268
00:17:35,374 --> 00:17:37,462
- All right, Mike.
- I'll let you know about it though, all right?

269
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:39,466
- All right.
- Be lucky. Don't work too hard, will ya?

270
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:41,512
Take care.

271
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,060
- Oh, it's lovely.
- Good. I'm glad you like it.

272
00:17:45,102 --> 00:17:48,484
- Yeah, it's gorgeous.
- I do think that, uh, 295 is a pretty good price.

273
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,864
- Well, it's pretty expensive, though, isn't it?
- A lot of money.

274
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:52,868
It's a rising market.
This is your chance to jump in.

275
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:55,039
You're first-time buyers.
There's no chain involved.

276
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:55,206
Right.

277
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:57,294
- You know, you should consider that.
- Right. We will.

278
00:17:57,335 --> 00:17:59,548
- We'll think about it.
- Good. I'll be in the car, yeah?

279
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:03,264
- All right. Thanks.
- I really like it though. I think it's gorgeous.

280
00:18:03,347 --> 00:18:05,686
- I'm just figuring the cost.
- I can do it.

281
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:09,026
What I earn at the pub
and your wages, easily, yeah.

282
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:11,947
I need somewhere to practice me trumpet
without the neighbors complaining.

283
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:16,582
You can practice anywhere. You don't play
anymore anyway. You and your trumpet.

284
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,839
- You really like it?
- I do. It's got a little garden.

285
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:22,470
- We'll figure out a way to do it.
- Really? Oh, really?

286
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:25,392
- Yeah.
- I love it.

287
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:28,941
Fifteen thousand.

288
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,698
Fifteen thousand.

289
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:35,370
No. I'm out.

290
00:18:35,454 --> 00:18:37,500
Yeah, me too.

291
00:18:44,681 --> 00:18:46,977
It's 15,000 to you,
Terry.

292
00:18:47,102 --> 00:18:49,023
Uh...

293
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:54,533
All right, I'll see ya.

294
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:01,547
Yeah.

295
00:19:01,631 --> 00:19:03,634
Played.

296
00:19:09,146 --> 00:19:11,902
Lend us 5,000.

297
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:16,202
Want 10?

298
00:19:16,327 --> 00:19:20,877
Lend us 5,000.
Thanks.

299
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,218
Oh, you all right?
Good to see you.

300
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:26,222
- Angela.
- Hi.

301
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:29,019
- Hey, gorgeous. You off?
- Oh, hey, babe. Listen, I left my phone at yours.

302
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:31,315
- Um, pick it up tomorrow?
- Okay. That's fine.

303
00:19:31,399 --> 00:19:33,403
- You were great tonight.
- Thank you.

304
00:19:33,444 --> 00:19:37,620
Look, uh, well, I was just in the area
and I wondered if you were free tonight?

305
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:40,209
- Um, no. No, I'm not, actually.
- Oh.

306
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,589
Um, I'd much rather go for a drink
with you than this date...

307
00:19:43,632 --> 00:19:45,593
but, um, can't really get out of it.

308
00:19:45,636 --> 00:19:49,477
Well, I-I-I understand.
I thought I would give it a try.

309
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:53,193
Well, if you are free tomorrow,
I'm doing a photo shoot in Brighton.

310
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:56,157
- A photo shoot?
- Yeah. I'm just modeling a few things.

311
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:58,912
You could, um, come if you like.
Spend the afternoon together?

312
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:01,459
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

313
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:04,591
All right.

314
00:20:07,054 --> 00:20:10,476
Terry? Terry. Thank God you're here.
Look, I know it's early-

315
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:13,399
- Ian, I won £30,000 last night.
- What? What?

316
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:15,737
- £30,000 playing poker.
- 30 grand?

317
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:18,409
Well, you need to put it in
a bank and never play again.

318
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:19,662
I can't tell you the feeling.

319
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:23,294
My head was swimming. It was like I stepped
out of my body. Every bet, every card.

320
00:20:23,336 --> 00:20:25,653
You lucky bast-You lucky bastard.

321
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,970
- Can I tell you something?
- What?

322
00:20:28,012 --> 00:20:32,145
The real thrill? Almost losing. Knowing I was
a card away from being wiped out and hanging in.

323
00:20:32,229 --> 00:20:34,275
Yeah. What about Kate?
She must be over the moon.

324
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:35,109
Oh, she doesn't know.

325
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,491
- No?
- No. She'd never understand. Not these stakes.

326
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,662
- Plus, I need the cash to play again.
- Terry.

327
00:20:40,746 --> 00:20:43,209
If I lose it back,
then I lose it back, all right?

328
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:46,508
My goal is to make enough money
to buy this house we saw. Then I'll tell her.

329
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,849
Right. I suppose now is as good a time as any
to ask if I could borrow a few hundred quid.

330
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:53,897
- Of course. What's mine is yours.
- Thanks.

331
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:56,486
Thirty grand.
That is a lot of cash, Terry.

332
00:20:56,611 --> 00:20:59,324
- Why is you here this hour?
- I need to borrow the X.K. again.

333
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,913
- Uh, it's not here, Brother.
- What?

334
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:04,001
- Got a heavy date?
- Yeah. How did you know?

335
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:07,549
- Well, loan us some money, borrow the flash car.
- Oh, yeah.

336
00:21:07,592 --> 00:21:09,721
What am I gonna do?
I do need that car.

337
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:11,766
- There is a nice E-type here.
- Is there?

338
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:13,812
I promised it back today...

339
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:16,985
- but I guess I can manipulate things for tomorrow.
- Let's have a look.

340
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:19,198
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah, that will do.

341
00:21:19,282 --> 00:21:21,202
Playin' the big shot
since we were this high.

342
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:24,416
All right, don't rub my nose in it. You should
see her. She's so beautiful, this woman.

343
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:26,420
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

344
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:29,718
Don't smash it up.
We'd have a lot of explaining to do.

345
00:22:42,447 --> 00:22:45,620
- Where the bloody hell were you yesterday?
- I couldn't make it in.

346
00:22:45,703 --> 00:22:49,503
You're supposed to be here. No one knew
what the bloody hell they were doing.

347
00:22:49,545 --> 00:22:51,924
You weren't here.
You weren't answering your mobile.

348
00:22:51,961 --> 00:22:52,759
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

349
00:22:52,801 --> 00:22:55,891
You waltz in here at 10
past 3:00 in the afternoon.

350
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:58,729
We were inspected yesterday.
Now they're gonna turn us over.

351
00:22:58,814 --> 00:23:01,151
Look, I'm sorry.
Sometimes I have a life of my own.

352
00:23:01,235 --> 00:23:05,284
What? Doing what? Some crackpot
financial scheme, eh? Or is it a woman?

353
00:23:05,326 --> 00:23:08,165
- Yes, Terry told me you had a date.
- Yes, I was with a girl.

354
00:23:08,249 --> 00:23:10,462
I've never been with a girl
like this before, Dad.

355
00:23:10,504 --> 00:23:16,433
She was beautiful and classy
and smart. Just leave it. Leave it.

356
00:23:16,516 --> 00:23:19,354
When they arrived, they found
these two literary geniuses...

357
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:24,866
floating around in the middle of the ocean
in their life jackets sipping martinis.

358
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:27,663
That's just what I was saying.
Sailing can be dangerous.

359
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:29,792
- Well, Ian has a boat.
- Oh, really?

360
00:23:29,876 --> 00:23:31,838
Oh, just a little
sailboat, yeah.

361
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,302
I've always wanted to sail
around the Greek islands.

362
00:23:34,343 --> 00:23:36,806
- Oh, God, that'd be fun, wouldn't it?
- Yeah.

363
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:38,810
Do you actually sleep
on the boat?

364
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:40,939
You can. It's very small,
but, yes, you can.

365
00:23:41,024 --> 00:23:43,153
- So what do you do, Ian?
- I'm in business.

366
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:47,578
- Hotels in California. Come. Shall we dance?
- Yes.

367
00:23:49,999 --> 00:23:53,382
Do you know what? Those two
make such a beautiful couple.

368
00:23:53,423 --> 00:23:57,514
I think it's their duty to reproduce.

369
00:23:57,597 --> 00:23:59,601
Take me sailing.

370
00:24:00,853 --> 00:24:02,983
I will.

371
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:07,909
I love it. You're so charmingly
awkward with my friends.

372
00:24:07,952 --> 00:24:09,997
It's so sweet.

373
00:24:14,382 --> 00:24:19,266
Take me to the Greek islands.
Take me all around the world.

374
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:23,358
I want us to go to California together.

375
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:33,502
Terry, I need to talk to you
about money again. I'm sorry.

376
00:24:33,545 --> 00:24:36,217
I wondered if I could borrow
the X.K. or the "E"?

377
00:24:36,258 --> 00:24:39,139
What's the matter with you?
You look like death warmed up.

378
00:24:39,223 --> 00:24:43,398
Ian, I lost a lot of money
in a card game last night.

379
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,863
- Well, how much?
- A lot. Come here.

380
00:24:46,946 --> 00:24:48,909
Well, what is a lot?
How much?

381
00:24:48,992 --> 00:24:51,163
- I lost back the 30.
- Yeah.

382
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:54,545
Plus another £90,000.

383
00:24:54,629 --> 00:24:56,508
Terry, what is wrong with you?

384
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:58,553
It was like I was in a trance.

385
00:24:58,595 --> 00:25:03,270
- I knew what was happening, but I still kept going.
- Well, that makes me sick.

386
00:25:03,355 --> 00:25:05,944
How are you going to
pay back £90,000?

387
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:09,033
I have to. I borrowed it
with heavy interest.

388
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,955
What, from loan sharks?
Terry, they're gonna break your legs.

389
00:25:11,997 --> 00:25:16,673
I kept borrowing and borrowing. I figured me
luck had to change, but it only got worse.

390
00:25:16,755 --> 00:25:21,431
Well, I would like to be sympathetic,
but you make me so angry. £90,000?

391
00:25:21,515 --> 00:25:25,314
Ah, Ian, what am I gonna do?

392
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,945
I don't know what you're gonna do.

393
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,951
You don't help yourself
with the whiskey and these pills.

394
00:25:31,076 --> 00:25:33,957
I get migraines, Ian.
Don't get on me. I need help.

395
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,044
Well, how am I gonna help you?

396
00:25:36,128 --> 00:25:41,931
Terry. Terry, I'm just a two-bit player myself
who plays a big shot in borrowed cars.

397
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,104
- I haven't got any money.
- You got some money put away. You told me.

398
00:25:45,147 --> 00:25:49,739
I have a little saved for this business
proposition, this investment, the hotel thing...

399
00:25:49,864 --> 00:25:52,244
but I haven't even got
enough for that.

400
00:25:52,328 --> 00:25:55,333
- How am I meant to help you?
- Well, I have to borrow some of it.

401
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:58,381
Just to make a couple of payments.

402
00:25:58,465 --> 00:26:01,471
- To stall them till I figure out what to do.
- What are you gonna do?

403
00:26:01,554 --> 00:26:03,517
- I don't know.
- To do what?

404
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:09,028
Terry, I came down to see you. And now
you're asking for my savings? Jesus Christ!

405
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:12,159
- I'm in real trouble, Ian.
- Yes, you're in real trouble.

406
00:26:54,368 --> 00:26:57,625
- Happy birthday, Mum.
- Cheers.

407
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,628
Well, I'm having a fine time...

408
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:02,343
and you two look like you got
the weight of the world on your shoulders.

409
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:05,474
No, no, it's not- No, it's not-
We're all right. I'm fine.

410
00:27:05,556 --> 00:27:07,478
- Yeah, me too.
- No, don't say you are.

411
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,066
I wake up 3:00 in the morning
last night, he's not there.

412
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:14,074
I go into the front room, and he's sitting there
talking to himself. What's that about?

413
00:27:14,158 --> 00:27:18,708
Well, your father's already started
to forget names and confuse things.

414
00:27:18,792 --> 00:27:21,631
In Terry's case it won't be dementia.
It will be blended whiskey.

415
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:27,017
Don't tell her that. She'll think he's alcoholic
because you passed him your genes.

416
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,815
- Mum, what did Uncle Howard get you?
- Flowers.

417
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,028
- Aren't they pretty? And £1,000.
- Oh, they're gorgeous.

418
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:34,907
He never forgets,
Howard, does he?

419
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,000
What's it to him? A crumb. If I had that
kind of wealth I'd send you some real money.

420
00:27:39,082 --> 00:27:41,004
But you don't have it.

421
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:45,095
We'll always be dependent on Howard.
Thank the Lord the man's a prince.

422
00:27:45,178 --> 00:27:46,931
Did he say where he is?

423
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:51,565
Well, he was still in China, but I think
he's going on holiday to Thailand.

424
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:53,862
- Oh.
- Yeah.

425
00:27:55,866 --> 00:28:00,417
- Mum, can I speak to you a minute?
- Yeah.

426
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:03,797
- I need to borrow some money.
- How much?

427
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:08,432
Any part of that £1,000 you can lend me.
Well, all of it, if you can.

428
00:28:08,516 --> 00:28:12,024
So what happened? Did your great
winning streak come to an abrupt end?

429
00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:15,906
- Mum-
- What was it? Cards or dice?

430
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:19,037
- Oh, what the bloody hell's the difference?
- Don't lecture me, Mum.

431
00:28:19,162 --> 00:28:24,590
- All right, I'll pay it back.
- With what? You owe everybody you know money.

432
00:28:24,674 --> 00:28:27,721
If I give you my birthday present,
I can say good-bye to it.

433
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:30,644
All right then, forget it!
All right?

434
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:32,606
I knew I was asking
the wrong person.

435
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:37,157
Your dad needs it to pay to the bank.
The restaurant's sucking him dry.

436
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:38,665
So let him dump it then.

437
00:28:38,702 --> 00:28:42,167
He's put his whole life into it.
It's not about the money.

438
00:28:42,209 --> 00:28:45,590
Well, isn't Ian helping
to get it back on its legs?

439
00:28:45,675 --> 00:28:48,596
Ian can only do so much,
and his heart's not in it.

440
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,731
But at least he's got some conscience.
You never had any conscience.

441
00:28:52,813 --> 00:28:55,694
- And Brian's not what he was.
- Can't Uncle Howard help?

442
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:59,578
He's too proud to ask Howard again,
and he won't let me.

443
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:01,582
Well, those two
never really got along.

444
00:29:01,665 --> 00:29:03,792
Yes, 'cause you rub his nose
in Howard's success.

445
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:05,881
Don't you lecture me!

446
00:29:05,964 --> 00:29:09,554
Drink and gambling,
that's your answer to life's problems.

447
00:29:14,523 --> 00:29:19,157
- Someone at the restaurant is stealing from me.
- What?

448
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,956
Oh, I suspect Lewis, the bookkeeper.
He's the only logical one.

449
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,674
But I've known him for years,
and I can't bring myself to accuse him.

450
00:29:27,716 --> 00:29:30,262
Oh, Dad. It's, uh-

451
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:35,022
- It's not Lewis. It's me.
- You?

452
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:39,197
Yeah. But I wasn't stealing it.
I had every intention of returning it.

453
00:29:39,281 --> 00:29:42,078
I hope you know I would
never steal from you.

454
00:29:42,162 --> 00:29:44,500
It's just that Terry
got himself in some debt...

455
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:46,672
and I've been- I've been
trying to help him out.

456
00:29:46,712 --> 00:29:50,177
And I had to use some money
I'd set aside for some business ventures.

457
00:29:50,262 --> 00:29:53,101
What business ventures?
Do you want to leave the restaurant?

458
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:56,691
Yeah, of course, one day, Dad.
I can't stay there forever. It will kill me.

459
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:59,572
But not- not next week or anything.

460
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:01,577
Look, I've met this incredible girl.

461
00:30:01,617 --> 00:30:03,581
You stole money.

462
00:30:03,621 --> 00:30:06,377
No. I'm trying to explain to you.
You just don't want to hear.

463
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:10,386
I had hoped I would be able to get it back
there before you even noticed.

464
00:30:10,427 --> 00:30:12,390
I wasn't trying to get away
with anything.

465
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:15,688
And I only took it because
Terry and I got in a bind.

466
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,195
- What kind of business venture?
- Investment in hotels.

467
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:21,616
What the hell do you know
about hotels?

468
00:30:21,657 --> 00:30:24,078
Uncle Howard's coming!

469
00:30:24,162 --> 00:30:27,920
Uncle Howard's coming.
He'll be here tomorrow.

470
00:30:28,003 --> 00:30:31,469
He'll only be in town for a little while,
and then he's leaving for the United States.

471
00:30:31,552 --> 00:30:34,390
But he wants to take us all out to lunch
to celebrate my birthday.

472
00:30:34,432 --> 00:30:38,525
Well, I'm sure he'll put on a big show and then
you won't see him again for another two years.

473
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:40,529
He's a busy man.

474
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:44,995
He hasn't time to sit in front of the television,
watching football and swilling beer.

475
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,920
Get out of my way, Brian, please. Thank you.

476
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:54,222
My plan is to get everything
lined up in advance...

477
00:30:54,265 --> 00:30:57,647
and with a bit of luck, we can close
this deal sooner than we expected.

478
00:30:57,729 --> 00:31:02,281
I'm gonna ask my Uncle Howard if he can
introduce you to some movers and shakers.

479
00:31:02,322 --> 00:31:04,285
Oh, I don't want to infringe.

480
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:07,249
No, no, no, no. He works with a lot of
movie industry people. He's very social.

481
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:11,508
He plays- He plays golf with some
top directors and some studio heads even.

482
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:14,346
Oh. God, that would be
a really big break for me.

483
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:17,312
Well, it's a good time
to ask for this favor.

484
00:31:17,352 --> 00:31:20,192
Well, you're so beautiful
and talented.

485
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:23,198
All you need is a chance to meet
some of the right people.

486
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:35,679
There he is. Howard.

487
00:31:35,764 --> 00:31:38,770
- Howard! Oh, my God!
- Hi.

488
00:31:38,852 --> 00:31:41,150
- Hello, love. You all right?
- All right, darling, yes.

489
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,821
- Happy birthday, sweetheart. There you are.
- Oh, my God.

490
00:31:43,906 --> 00:31:45,951
- Uncle Howard, this is Kate.
- Oh, hello, Kate.

491
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,996
Lovely to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

492
00:31:48,081 --> 00:31:51,629
- Yeah, well, it's probably, uh, exaggeration.
- You look great.

493
00:31:51,711 --> 00:31:53,967
Oh, doesn't he look wond-
So-So where are we eating?

494
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:56,138
- We're going, uh- I booked a table at Claridge's.
- Claridge's?

495
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,184
Oh, we're-we're
not dressed, really.

496
00:31:58,225 --> 00:32:00,313
You can have rich food
for once in your life.

497
00:32:00,355 --> 00:32:03,611
I'm sure your ulcer will survi- Did you
see the doctor that I arranged for you?

498
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:06,117
- I did, yes.
- He says it's nothing serious, so-

499
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:08,121
- Well, the pain's damn serious, but-
- Come on, Brian.

500
00:32:08,203 --> 00:32:11,544
- What time we booked in?
- Uh, 1:00, so we, uh-we better go, all right?

501
00:32:11,627 --> 00:32:13,840
Come on. Don't get
left behind. Come on.

502
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:19,393
You'd-You'd be amazed what's
happening in-in-in China today.

503
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:22,190
It's a really vital
and exciting place.

504
00:32:22,316 --> 00:32:25,030
Now there's a trade surplus opening up...

505
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:27,034
and our clinic's really gonna do well.

506
00:32:27,117 --> 00:32:31,542
You wouldn't think that the Chinese would be
so into cosmetic surgery, would you?

507
00:32:31,626 --> 00:32:33,589
They're-They're capitalists, Kate.

508
00:32:33,671 --> 00:32:36,052
They're-They're-They're way
more capitalistic than we are.

509
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:36,594
Right.

510
00:32:36,677 --> 00:32:39,893
Do you know, I was hoping you'd bring
your new wife. I'd love to meet her.

511
00:32:39,976 --> 00:32:42,523
Ah, yes, I know. Well, Connie's busy.

512
00:32:42,606 --> 00:32:45,654
She-She does a lot of work
promoting our clinic back in L.A., so-

513
00:32:45,738 --> 00:32:48,077
But she really wanted to come.

514
00:32:48,117 --> 00:32:52,876
And, Howard, you never
think of having a family?

515
00:32:52,918 --> 00:32:56,425
- You're my family.
- Oh, Howard.

516
00:32:56,466 --> 00:32:58,095
- Oh, Howard.
- Thanks, Howard.

517
00:32:58,179 --> 00:32:59,639
That's sweet.

518
00:32:59,723 --> 00:33:02,312
Everything's okay?
You need anything?

519
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:07,154
Well, we're all right, thank God. But, look,
Howard, I know the boys wanted to talk to you.

520
00:33:07,281 --> 00:33:11,079
Boys, I was just telling Howard that
you'd want to talk to him privately.

521
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:13,293
Uh, yeah,
if-if-if you have some time.

522
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:16,215
When it's convenient
for you.

523
00:33:16,257 --> 00:33:19,848
Yeah, well, uh, we'll just drop
Brian and Dorothy at home...

524
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,603
and then we'll-we'll-we'll have a drink,
just the three of us.

525
00:33:22,686 --> 00:33:24,607
- There you go, boys.
- All right, great.

526
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:28,114
That's lovely, Howard.
Thank you, darling. You made my day.

527
00:33:28,155 --> 00:33:30,995
I couldn't help myself, Uncle Howard.

528
00:33:31,036 --> 00:33:33,916
I mean, I know we talked about it
and I gave you my word...

529
00:33:33,959 --> 00:33:39,303
but sometimes, I-I just get
out of control, you know?

530
00:33:39,387 --> 00:33:42,935
I'll get help.
I promise it won't happen again.

531
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:46,484
For Christ's sake, Terry, stop cryin'.
Uncle Howard's not berating you.

532
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:49,448
He's- He just-
He's drank a little too much.

533
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:51,870
Well, I-I-I don't
set myself up as a judge.

534
00:33:51,953 --> 00:33:56,170
I- I-I counsel common sense.
I understand human needs.

535
00:33:56,296 --> 00:34:01,389
All right. But I know I got myself into this bind
and I'm aware of how serious it is.

536
00:34:01,514 --> 00:34:04,311
Yeah, yes, I hear you. Now, y-you just-
you just pull yourself together.

537
00:34:04,354 --> 00:34:06,942
I'm not going to-
I'm not going to lecture you.

538
00:34:06,984 --> 00:34:09,780
I think losing such a steep
amount is a lesson in itself...

539
00:34:09,905 --> 00:34:11,993
much, much more than
anything I could say.

540
00:34:12,076 --> 00:34:14,498
God. I feel like
suddenly I'm in a dream.

541
00:34:14,581 --> 00:34:17,838
Well, everybody makes mistakes.
We'll deal with it.

542
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:22,681
The key is you-you-you recognize
the need for help, okay?

543
00:34:22,764 --> 00:34:24,977
Yeah.

544
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,231
So, Ian, what's on your mind?

545
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,361
Um...

546
00:34:29,445 --> 00:34:34,328
well, you always said if I found something I
wanted to devote myself to to come to you.

547
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:38,171
- Ian's met this girl.
- Let me tell it, Terry.

548
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:41,510
I have a chance of coming in
on a surefire business deal.

549
00:34:41,594 --> 00:34:45,352
Yeah, well, there's no such thing
as a surefire deal, but go on.

550
00:34:45,393 --> 00:34:49,818
There's some partners want to invest in two
hotels, in your neck of the woods, actually...

551
00:34:49,861 --> 00:34:51,822
in-in Los Angeles...

552
00:34:51,865 --> 00:34:56,416
- and naturally, this requires an outlay of funds.
- Oh, yeah.

553
00:34:56,499 --> 00:34:59,046
Which, of course, you would
get back with interest.

554
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:01,634
If the hotels show a profit.

555
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:03,931
They will, Uncle Howard.
They will.

556
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:06,645
So what kind of money
are we looking at?

557
00:35:06,727 --> 00:35:11,028
£70,000 or £80,000.
Possibly even £100,000.

558
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:16,539
Well, can I let my accountants have a look at
what details you have? It could be of some help.

559
00:35:16,664 --> 00:35:19,086
We'll, I'll be- I'll be grateful
for any guidance, of course...

560
00:35:19,169 --> 00:35:22,092
but, uh, I really
need the money soon.

561
00:35:23,303 --> 00:35:25,639
And-And who is
this young woman?

562
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:29,314
Ah. Well, our plan is to move
to California. She's an actress.

563
00:35:29,397 --> 00:35:35,033
I- I was gonna ask you if there were some people
you-you might be able to introduce her to.

564
00:35:35,075 --> 00:35:38,541
Oh, yeah, for sure.
Contacts never hurt an aspiring talent.

565
00:35:38,623 --> 00:35:41,087
Oh, she would be
so grateful, as would I.

566
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:44,052
I'm obviously
just crazy about her.

567
00:35:44,094 --> 00:35:47,267
I'm very close with a lot of people
in the film industry and some, uh-

568
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:51,065
- I just feel it's- it's now or never for me.
- Oh, yeah.

569
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:55,867
Yeah, I understand that feeling. You-You see
a real opportunity, you really want to grab it.

570
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:59,249
Otherwise, you spend the rest of your life
wondering what might have been.

571
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:02,380
We'll both find a way
to pay you back.

572
00:36:02,465 --> 00:36:05,136
Yeah, well, I, um-

573
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,224
I wanted to talk to you about that.

574
00:36:07,265 --> 00:36:11,691
Uh, let's, um- let's- let's go under those trees.

575
00:36:21,753 --> 00:36:26,930
Well, um, I think you'll agree that
family loyalty cuts both ways.

576
00:36:26,972 --> 00:36:27,853
Oh, without a doubt.

577
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,270
And thank God I've never had
to ask you for anything...

578
00:36:30,312 --> 00:36:35,364
but, uh, the time has come when,
uh, I need your help.

579
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:37,910
- Name it, Uncle Howard.
- Anything.

580
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:41,042
Well, I seem to have got
myself into a little situation.

581
00:36:41,078 --> 00:36:41,249
Yes?

582
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:45,132
Well, uh, actually, it's, uh- it's-
it's more serious than that.

583
00:36:45,216 --> 00:36:47,972
And, uh, after much thought,
there don't seem to be many options.

584
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:48,352
Right.

585
00:36:48,389 --> 00:36:51,520
Well, there's going to be
a review in a few months...

586
00:36:51,645 --> 00:36:55,862
an investigation into my, uh, business affairs,
you know, the foundation and the clinics-

587
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:58,367
and, uh, there's
a former member of staff...

588
00:36:58,451 --> 00:37:03,002
who is prepared to talk about things that
could be extremely detrimental to me.

589
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:05,048
I, uh- extremely.

590
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:07,092
But surely you have
nothing to worry about.

591
00:37:07,135 --> 00:37:09,848
Well, to be
quite candid, I-

592
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:13,690
I really can't allow
a colleague called Martin Burns...

593
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,194
to give certain evidence.

594
00:37:16,278 --> 00:37:18,784
But why?
Sorry, I-I'm not following.

595
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:22,832
Well, I-I'm in a very vulnerable position
and the consequences could be dire.

596
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:26,507
Well, what are the options? Is this Martin
Burns unwilling to listen to reason?

597
00:37:26,591 --> 00:37:31,643
Well, unfortunately, I've had several discussions
with him, and he just won't see it my way.

598
00:37:31,726 --> 00:37:33,981
Well, why not?
Is it not just a question of money?

599
00:37:34,022 --> 00:37:36,903
Well, not really. I don't think
compensation would change his mind...

600
00:37:36,987 --> 00:37:40,995
and, to be quite honest,
it's not a road I really want to go down.

601
00:37:41,037 --> 00:37:43,040
Well, what then?

602
00:37:44,293 --> 00:37:48,677
Uh, I think Burns
has to be got rid of.

603
00:37:48,713 --> 00:37:50,681
Rid of?

604
00:37:50,723 --> 00:37:53,854
If there was any other solution,
and believe me, I have racked my brains-

605
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:55,858
But unless he's out of the picture...

606
00:37:55,941 --> 00:37:59,990
I am looking at a very long period of time
in jail, what could be the rest of my life.

607
00:38:00,032 --> 00:38:02,202
My God.
What have you done?

608
00:38:02,287 --> 00:38:05,543
- Don't talk to me like that!
- I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean any disrespect.

609
00:38:05,585 --> 00:38:09,676
I have made some very, very difficult
decisions to avoid being ruined.

610
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,768
I was aware when I made them that I was
having- that I was taking some kind of risk.

611
00:38:13,852 --> 00:38:17,191
But the stakes were enormous. I shouldn't
have to talk to you about betting on risks.

612
00:38:17,234 --> 00:38:18,157
I didn't mean anything.

613
00:38:18,193 --> 00:38:20,866
You don't build what I've built
by always playing by the book.

614
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:23,914
- Now you'll find that out.
- Uncle Howard, he didn't mean to be rude.

615
00:38:23,956 --> 00:38:28,046
You didn't question my ethics when you were,
uh-when you wanted something from me.

616
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,095
Look, Uncle Howard, we're
not questioning your ethics.

617
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:33,432
- I'm sure you know what you're doing.
- We're just surprised.

618
00:38:33,475 --> 00:38:37,065
Oh, what? Surprised? Surprised by what?
Surprised that I need some help?

619
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,698
Surprised that, uh-
that-that my life could fall apart...

620
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,578
if this one weak sister,
this ungrateful failure...

621
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,459
elects to sell me out
to save his own skin?

622
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:51,010
By getting rid of him,
do- do you mean-

623
00:38:51,093 --> 00:38:56,688
He cannot be allowed to testify
by whatever means are necessary.

624
00:38:56,771 --> 00:38:58,859
He wants us to kill him.

625
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,700
But at this point,
I can see no other way.

626
00:39:02,783 --> 00:39:05,414
I can't beg it. I can't buy it.

627
00:39:05,497 --> 00:39:07,918
But this has to happen
in order for me to survive.

628
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,925
- God. God.
- Christ, be a man.

629
00:39:10,966 --> 00:39:12,971
I don't want to kill anybody.

630
00:39:13,054 --> 00:39:17,103
I need to know if you two can come through
for me. You're the only people I can turn to.

631
00:39:17,186 --> 00:39:22,447
But there must be people who do
this sort of thing f-for a fee, I mean.

632
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,952
Well, I-I-I wouldn't know
how to find such a person.

633
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:27,708
And if I did, they'd
always have it over me...

634
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:31,340
or-or they'd turn out to be some
undercover policeman or something.

635
00:39:31,423 --> 00:39:34,554
I mean,
I am in unfamiliar waters.

636
00:39:34,596 --> 00:39:38,312
I need the help of people
who I can trust with my life.

637
00:39:38,397 --> 00:39:41,235
- I cannot kill somebody.
- Oh, right.

638
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:44,325
So that's it, isn't it? It's fine
to count on me, your mother...

639
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:46,871
your father when he couldn't
put food on the table.

640
00:39:46,997 --> 00:39:49,292
It's fine for you to come-
come to me for everything.

641
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:53,300
It's what you're askin', Uncle Howard.
You can see the imbalance.

642
00:39:53,342 --> 00:39:55,848
Burns could have an accident.

643
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:59,981
Burns could be hit by car or-
or killed in a street mugging.

644
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:03,613
- Jesus Christ, Uncle Howard!
- Stop! Stop simpering!

645
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:05,659
What the hell is wrong with you?

646
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:07,997
You people come to me begging for favors.

647
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,670
"Help me, Uncle Howard.
I need money. I'm in over my head.

648
00:40:11,755 --> 00:40:14,594
I made a mistake.
Help me change my life."

649
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:20,439
How can I help you? How can I attend to
your needs if I'm rotting away somewhere?

650
00:40:20,522 --> 00:40:22,860
Christ, I can't believe you're
putting me through this stuff.

651
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:25,281
After what I've done for you,
it should be automatic.

652
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:28,663
Family is family.
Blood is blood.

653
00:40:28,747 --> 00:40:31,543
You don't ask questions.
You protect your own.

654
00:40:31,585 --> 00:40:34,466
- I can't do it!
- It's- It's not that.

655
00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:37,680
I mean, this is so much more
than just a simple favor.

656
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:42,899
Don't lecture me. I wasn't born yesterday.
I realize- I know the gravity of what this-

657
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,987
- Oh, please, just-just forget it.
- I can't do it!

658
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:49,704
You can do it! You make it look like
an accident. It's just that you won't do it.

659
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:53,170
I've got nobody else
that I can count on.

660
00:40:53,212 --> 00:40:56,343
Don't- Don't bother. Forget I asked.

661
00:40:56,385 --> 00:40:59,516
Forget- Forget we know each other. Let's
have nothing more to do with each other...

662
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:05,027
because, obviously, your idea of family is,
uh- is very different from mine.

663
00:41:08,242 --> 00:41:11,206
I've never seen him like that.
He was so angry. He was a different person.

664
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,671
- He's a crook, Ian.
- Terry, we don't know all the details.

665
00:41:14,756 --> 00:41:17,928
Christ, what's he expect?
We're gonna kill some guy for him?

666
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:20,642
He was desperate. If you look
at it from his point of view...

667
00:41:20,726 --> 00:41:23,355
a favor that's easy to do,
you can ask anyone for, but-

668
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,405
if you have to ask someone a favor that's a real
favor, then you know who your friends are.

669
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:29,911
- To think we'd be capable of such a thing.
- I agree.

670
00:41:29,952 --> 00:41:32,457
I mean, family is one thing,
but there are limits.

671
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,921
You'd never consider anything
like that, would you?

672
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:36,926
No. Would you?

673
00:41:36,966 --> 00:41:40,683
- Not me. You think he hates us?
- I think he's disappointed.

674
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:42,687
Yeah, well, I am too.

675
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,400
Well, it's been a day of shattered hopes
for you, me and Howard.

676
00:41:45,442 --> 00:41:48,531
Oh, Christ. You think he'll wind up
in prison for the rest of his life?

677
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:50,868
I don't know. It doesn't bear
thinkin' about. Terry...

678
00:41:50,952 --> 00:41:55,086
- my hands are shakin'.
- I don't feel good, Ian.

679
00:41:55,169 --> 00:41:58,259
Christ, I think
I'm gonna be sick.

680
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,414
Terry? Terry, wake up.
Terry, wake-wake-wake-wake-wake up.

681
00:42:13,456 --> 00:42:16,504
It's all right. You're havin' a bad dream.
You're havin' a bad dream.

682
00:42:16,545 --> 00:42:19,969
It's all right. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

683
00:42:20,052 --> 00:42:21,102
My heart is pounding.

684
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:24,227
Yeah, you're really sweating.
What on earth were you dreaming?

685
00:42:24,312 --> 00:42:26,483
Oh, Kate, we have to move.

686
00:42:26,566 --> 00:42:31,117
- What are you talkin' about? We can't move.
- Oh, yeah, we have to move.

687
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,705
No, we live here.
Our lives are here. We're not moving.

688
00:42:33,788 --> 00:42:36,126
What on earth were you dreaming?
For God's sake.

689
00:42:36,169 --> 00:42:39,717
God! Who's that? It's 4:00 in the morning.

690
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,763
Christ.

691
00:42:41,846 --> 00:42:43,767
- Who is it?
- Hello?

692
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:46,940
- It's me.
- What's wrong? Are you all right?

693
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:49,862
- Who is it?
- We need to talk.

694
00:42:49,905 --> 00:42:51,784
What is it?

695
00:42:51,866 --> 00:42:53,955
I don't want to
speak on the phone.

696
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:58,380
I just want to say that
I- I haven't slept all night.

697
00:42:58,463 --> 00:43:01,845
I've been up and down
a dozen times thinkin' and...

698
00:43:01,928 --> 00:43:06,813
the conclusion I've come to is that we're
gonna have to accommodate Uncle Howard.

699
00:43:06,854 --> 00:43:11,823
He'll be in London for the next few weeks.
He, uh- He has a flat in Knightsbridge.

700
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:13,869
We need to get
a good look at him.

701
00:43:13,951 --> 00:43:17,166
I'm having breakfast
with him at the Connaught.

702
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:21,174
I've-I've worked hard at- at, uh,
keeping good relations with him...

703
00:43:21,216 --> 00:43:25,474
but, um, we both know
what the score is, that's for sure.

704
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:28,564
Anyway, I'll tell you when we're there
and then you can be there as well.

705
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:31,821
And you can stop
by the table and, uh-

706
00:43:31,863 --> 00:43:36,330
and, uh, I'll introduce you, and then
you can get a good look at him.

707
00:43:36,414 --> 00:43:41,131
It sounds good to me. We need to know
who it is that we're gonna- that we're gonna-

708
00:43:41,215 --> 00:43:43,720
- You can't even say it.
- Terry.

709
00:43:43,803 --> 00:43:46,559
- You can't even say what it is we're talking about.
- No, wait.

710
00:43:46,643 --> 00:43:51,569
Wait, wait, wait. I-I thought, um-
I thought we were past this bit.

711
00:43:51,653 --> 00:43:56,036
We are. We are.
We'll check him out at the Connaught.

712
00:43:58,792 --> 00:44:01,756
All right, well, I'll give you,
um, all the information you need-

713
00:44:01,798 --> 00:44:07,518
where he lives in London, his flat, you know,
when he visits his- his mother, phone numbers...

714
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:11,234
and then-
then it's in your hands.

715
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:13,534
Don't let me down.

716
00:44:13,571 --> 00:44:16,076
Now, I shall be
in the Far East for a few days...

717
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:19,458
and I want it taken care of
while I'm away.

718
00:44:19,542 --> 00:44:22,588
I don't want to know about it.

719
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:28,350
I just want it over and done with
when I get back.

720
00:44:28,434 --> 00:44:33,277
Quick, simple, no witnesses.

721
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,870
And then just let it
fade into history.

722
00:44:37,953 --> 00:44:42,503
You can count on us,
Uncle Howard. You can. Yeah.

723
00:44:43,965 --> 00:44:49,393
I understand the- the magnitude
of the favor that I'm asking.

724
00:44:49,435 --> 00:44:53,610
But I promise you, boys,
you won't be sorry.

725
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,660
Oh, I can't do it, Ian. I can't!

726
00:44:57,743 --> 00:45:01,751
No, we're gonna do it, Terry. Because Uncle
Howard needs us to do this very badly.

727
00:45:01,834 --> 00:45:05,550
Oh, let's not play games, Ian. You're
thinkin' of us, what we can get out of it.

728
00:45:05,633 --> 00:45:07,680
I'm not playing games, Terry.

729
00:45:07,763 --> 00:45:11,479
Your whole life is in the toilet unless you've
got some way of payin' off a £90,000 debt.

730
00:45:11,604 --> 00:45:14,235
- I'm not as cool as you are, Ian.
- I am not cool, Terry.

731
00:45:14,317 --> 00:45:19,453
I- I-I'm finding it very hard not to panic.
But this is a way out for me too.

732
00:45:19,495 --> 00:45:23,378
Now you don't like playing on
the small-stake tables. Well, neither do I.

733
00:45:23,461 --> 00:45:26,884
This is a big shot for me, Terry.
To make a big step up in life.

734
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:29,640
- Ian, it's murder. All right?
- I know what it is.

735
00:45:29,725 --> 00:45:34,358
- Yeah, well, don't forget it!
- You don't have to explain it to me, Terry.

736
00:45:34,442 --> 00:45:39,409
This guy is just a total stranger to us who's
doing a very bad thing to Uncle Howard.

737
00:45:39,492 --> 00:45:41,913
Christ. Why can't he listen to reason?

738
00:45:41,998 --> 00:45:44,084
Why's he have to go opening
his mouth to investigators?

739
00:45:44,169 --> 00:45:47,885
Look, I've been thinking about this, Terry.
You push a button and it's over.

740
00:45:47,968 --> 00:45:49,888
Except it's not a button, Ian.

741
00:45:49,972 --> 00:45:53,020
For Christ's sake! Why do you have
to keep making matters worse?

742
00:45:53,103 --> 00:45:55,274
It's a job. If we were in the army...

743
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:57,695
we'd be expected to
kill strangers every day...

744
00:45:57,738 --> 00:45:59,784
to profit men who're
up to here in corruption.

745
00:45:59,867 --> 00:46:04,209
Well, I can't look him
face-to-face and then kill him.

746
00:46:04,293 --> 00:46:06,672
This is wrong, Ian!
It's just wrong!

747
00:46:06,756 --> 00:46:10,764
Christ. Will you stop lookin' at everything
through a bloody microscope?

748
00:46:10,847 --> 00:46:15,232
As soon as you look at anything too closely,
you reveal all the ugly imperfections.

749
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:19,281
Look, for the first time in my life,
I've met a woman and I'm in love with her.

750
00:46:19,364 --> 00:46:21,787
Now if you don't want to
do this, I'll do it myself.

751
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:24,835
We'll get caught! Every murderer
thinks he can get away with it...

752
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:27,214
and then something little
goes wrong and it's over.

753
00:46:27,256 --> 00:46:30,032
No, you're wrong. You're wrong.
Most killings go unsolved.

754
00:46:30,068 --> 00:46:32,808
The real world is not what
you watch on the television.

755
00:46:32,892 --> 00:46:34,812
Well, if we do it,
there's no turnin' back.

756
00:46:34,896 --> 00:46:38,152
Look. I think I know how you feel
when you're at the card table.

757
00:46:38,194 --> 00:46:40,282
I feel like I'm in a dream.

758
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:44,540
I think we have got the winning hand, and I
want to plunge forward. I want to push my luck.

759
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:47,045
I can't look him in the eye
and then kill him. Right?

760
00:46:47,081 --> 00:46:47,463
Okay, okay.

761
00:46:47,546 --> 00:46:50,469
We'll just observe him from
a distance at breakfast, all right?

762
00:46:50,553 --> 00:46:53,975
We'll get a good look and then
there'll be no mistakin' him.

763
00:46:57,483 --> 00:46:59,569
Stop staring, Ian.

764
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:01,657
I want to get a good look at him.

765
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,584
That poor bastard.
Eatin' his breakfast.

766
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:09,089
He has no idea
his days are numbered.

767
00:47:09,172 --> 00:47:11,176
Oh, life can be so wicked, Ian.

768
00:47:11,259 --> 00:47:15,476
Have you got a good look at him, Terry?
Will you remember his face? I will.

769
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:24,995
I just got a small part in this French film
that I auditioned for.

770
00:47:25,037 --> 00:47:28,419
The director thinks
I'd look classy in bed.

771
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:32,261
- Do you speak French?
- Mmm. I'm fluent, actually.

772
00:47:32,302 --> 00:47:37,019
My uncle is learning Chinese
at his age. It's brilliant.

773
00:47:37,056 --> 00:47:38,106
You guys close?

774
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:42,239
He lives in California.
He's got a big house, beautiful pool, car.

775
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:46,539
He's a great guy. Would you sleep
with a director to get a part?

776
00:47:46,873 --> 00:47:50,839
Well, that depends upon the part
and who the director is...

777
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:53,470
and whether or not
I've had enough to drink.

778
00:47:53,553 --> 00:47:56,727
That's not a very
comforting answer.

779
00:47:56,809 --> 00:47:59,106
I didn't like the question.

780
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:28,038
- Bernard?
- No, it's not Bernard. It's me.

781
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,669
- Ian.
- Christ, I've been waitin' out here all night.

782
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,673
- What are you talking about?
- Who's Bernard?

783
00:48:32,714 --> 00:48:34,927
Who is Bernard leaving
your apartment in the morning?

784
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,474
- Ian, have you- have you been spying on me?
- Who is he?

785
00:48:37,558 --> 00:48:40,355
Is he the director or the producer
of your new French film?

786
00:48:40,437 --> 00:48:42,609
Ian, I can't believe you've
been waiting outside my flat.

787
00:48:42,693 --> 00:48:44,947
Angela, I thought we were
making plans together.

788
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:48,037
- Well, what kind of plans?
- I thought we were going to California together.

789
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,793
Ian, I have a life here.
I can't just pack up and go.

790
00:48:50,876 --> 00:48:53,256
You'll have your business and
I'll end up waiting on tables.

791
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:56,554
You won't have to wait on tables.
I'll be there lookin' out for you.

792
00:48:56,597 --> 00:49:00,227
I- I don't understand
what you want from me.

793
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:06,115
What do you want from me? I'm-I'm-I'm
moody and I'm-I'm self-obsessed.

794
00:49:06,198 --> 00:49:08,286
And I'm ambitious.

795
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:11,334
And beyond your cool exterior,
I sense you're bluffing.

796
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:11,918
No, I'm not.

797
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:14,465
I'm gonna take you
to California, Angela. I am.

798
00:49:14,507 --> 00:49:19,475
And if you don't think I will,
then-then call my bluff. I am.

799
00:49:30,497 --> 00:49:33,001
Have you thought about how we're
gonna take care of Martin Burns?

800
00:49:33,085 --> 00:49:35,339
No. Have you?

801
00:49:35,423 --> 00:49:37,469
Come here.

802
00:49:38,972 --> 00:49:41,727
I want it to be like
a hit-and-run accident.

803
00:49:41,811 --> 00:49:45,234
It's tricky, 'cause someone could see the
license plate and we couldn't be sure he'd die.

804
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:47,739
- Well, I know I'm not stickin' a knife in him.
- Why not?

805
00:49:47,823 --> 00:49:50,745
'Cause I can't. Can you?

806
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:54,043
I don't know, Terry. I don't know what
I'm capable of till I'm facing the moment.

807
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:56,172
- You could kill him with a knife?
- Or a hammer.

808
00:49:56,215 --> 00:49:58,176
I was thinkin' like
a muggin' with a hammer.

809
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:02,978
Jesus, I'm startin' to think I don't know you,
Ian. Look, if we do this, it-it has to be-

810
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,982
What? Nice and clean
and sanitized...

811
00:50:05,024 --> 00:50:06,945
so we can fool ourselves
about what we're doing?

812
00:50:07,028 --> 00:50:10,034
- I'm just sayin' there's a line I can't cross.
- A gun is the quickest way.

813
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,623
I'm just sayin' let's do it
as humanely as possible, all right?

814
00:50:12,664 --> 00:50:14,628
We could strangle him with a wire.

815
00:50:14,668 --> 00:50:18,133
We could get him on the ground,
the two of us, and strangle him with a wire.

816
00:50:18,217 --> 00:50:20,472
This isn't us, Ian.
It's not the Blaine brothers.

817
00:50:20,556 --> 00:50:22,935
The Blaine brothers are
a couple of losers, Terry.

818
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:27,152
There's no great pride to be
had in what we've achieved.

819
00:50:27,235 --> 00:50:30,534
Well, look, if we strangle him,
he'd put up a fight, right?

820
00:50:30,617 --> 00:50:32,996
Now, I think we could take him,
but it could get messy.

821
00:50:33,122 --> 00:50:36,755
Well, we'll have to make a decision one way
or the other. We've only got three weeks.

822
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:40,763
I can't talk about it.
Let's just enjoy our drinks.

823
00:50:42,223 --> 00:50:47,483
Carol's had an accident.
Except I don't think it was an accident.

824
00:50:47,526 --> 00:50:49,779
I think she was drunk
when she took the car...

825
00:50:49,863 --> 00:50:52,243
and she didn't much care if
she made it back to town or not.

826
00:50:52,284 --> 00:50:55,875
Well, suppose if I told you I don't care.
In fact, I'm glad it happened.

827
00:50:55,959 --> 00:50:57,879
I only wish it'd been fatal.

828
00:50:57,963 --> 00:51:00,844
It might be yet.
Everything's a bit touch and go.

829
00:51:00,886 --> 00:51:03,850
It's funny how life
boils down to this.

830
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:06,981
Life is nothing
if not totally ironic.

831
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:11,741
Usually brilliant.
Well done. Well done, as always.

832
00:51:11,824 --> 00:51:14,580
- There she is. Hello, darlin'.
- Oh, hi.

833
00:51:14,621 --> 00:51:17,126
- How are you? You were fantastic again.
- I'm all right.

834
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,381
- This is Kate and Terry.
- Oh, lovely to meet you.

835
00:51:19,465 --> 00:51:21,970
They've been dying to meet you.
I've been going on and on and on about you.

836
00:51:22,053 --> 00:51:24,433
- Brother. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, I loved it.

837
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:26,520
Thank you so much.
It was really nice of you to come.

838
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:28,524
- Brilliant.
- Thank you. It means a lot.

839
00:51:28,608 --> 00:51:31,572
What are you up to this evening?
Do you wanna- Do you wanna join us?

840
00:51:31,614 --> 00:51:33,535
We're going to a party.
My friend finished filming today.

841
00:51:33,618 --> 00:51:35,080
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

842
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:37,084
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- It's okay with you?

843
00:51:37,167 --> 00:51:39,546
Yeah, that'd be great. Bit of a squeeze,
though, Terry. Bit of a crush.

844
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:41,967
- I'll manage.
- Hold your stomach in.

845
00:51:53,617 --> 00:51:56,163
I can see why you're
so crazy about Angela.

846
00:51:56,248 --> 00:51:58,376
She's very, very different
from the women you've known.

847
00:51:58,417 --> 00:52:00,422
I've never been with
anyone like her before.

848
00:52:00,462 --> 00:52:02,426
And we've known
a few juicy ones.

849
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:04,430
Do you remember
Fenella Griffith?

850
00:52:04,471 --> 00:52:06,935
Remember her? You passed her off to me.
How could I forget?

851
00:52:07,017 --> 00:52:09,606
You make it sound like it wasn't
the biggest favor in the world.

852
00:52:09,689 --> 00:52:12,487
I never said she wasn't
wonderfully depraved.

853
00:52:12,571 --> 00:52:16,871
Angela's better than that, though.
She's innocent and also depraved.

854
00:52:16,954 --> 00:52:20,294
She's working class, but classy.
And that smile, Terry, that smile.

855
00:52:20,378 --> 00:52:22,298
Lovely. Oh, she's lovely.

856
00:52:22,382 --> 00:52:25,930
Look at the two of them. Dancin'
and laughin' like there's no tomorrow.

857
00:52:26,015 --> 00:52:30,105
"Ain't life grand," Terry? Do you know
what that's from? "Ain't life grand?"

858
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:37,204
One day you reach a point
and there is no tomorrow, Ian.

859
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:37,830
Oh, Terry.

860
00:52:37,913 --> 00:52:40,126
All right, look, we just
have to take care of business.

861
00:52:40,168 --> 00:52:42,297
Then it'll be done
and we can move on.

862
00:52:44,176 --> 00:52:48,226
- I figured out how to do it.
- Yeah?

863
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:50,313
Come here.

864
00:52:55,366 --> 00:52:58,747
Remember when we were kids?
Bobby North from down the road?

865
00:52:58,784 --> 00:53:00,333
I remember he was a bad kid.

866
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:03,298
Yeah. Yeah, well, me and Bobby
made a gun once. He showed me how.

867
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:06,220
- What, you made one?
- Yeah, we made a gun out of wood, right?

868
00:53:06,303 --> 00:53:10,646
And-And-And a little piece of metal.
It fired one bullet.

869
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,234
Do you ever hear of people
talkin' about a zip gun?

870
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,444
Yeah, but was it reliable?

871
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:17,159
It's the real thing, Ian.
You can't trace it back, all right?

872
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:20,707
Cause when you're finished, you take the
wood, which is most of it, and you burn it.

873
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,504
Then you take the metal pieces and
you dump 'em down different sewers.

874
00:53:23,545 --> 00:53:25,508
- Yeah, but one shot, Terry.
- What?

875
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:27,512
You'll have to make
two of them- one each.

876
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:30,330
That way if anything happens,
or goes wrong, we've got a backup.

877
00:53:30,366 --> 00:53:33,106
Right. Well, I think I can get
me hands on a couple of bullets.

878
00:53:33,148 --> 00:53:35,402
Yeah. I don't think there's any question.
Two loaded guns.

879
00:53:35,487 --> 00:53:37,491
We can make this come off quick and clean.

880
00:53:37,574 --> 00:53:40,955
What are you in such deep conversation about?
Are you plotting an assassination?

881
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,005
- Come on, I want to dance. It's our song.
- Yeah? Oh, yeah. All right.

882
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:47,219
On stage.

883
00:53:48,888 --> 00:53:50,892
Who was that guy
you were talking to?

884
00:53:50,934 --> 00:53:53,231
What? Tim?
He's, um, a writer.

885
00:53:53,272 --> 00:53:55,486
He just sold one of his screenplays
to a Hollywood studio.

886
00:53:55,568 --> 00:53:58,574
- Well, he couldn't take his eyes off you.
- Is that bad?

887
00:53:58,611 --> 00:54:01,080
Well, I'm sure it wasn't
thrilling for his wife.

888
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,710
That wasn't his wife, that was his date.
Are you angry with me?

889
00:54:03,794 --> 00:54:05,714
I know what's in his mind.

890
00:54:05,797 --> 00:54:09,222
Ian, I don't affect everyone
the way that I affect you.

891
00:54:09,263 --> 00:54:11,851
If I did, my career would have
taken off a long time ago.

892
00:54:11,935 --> 00:54:16,193
- Look, Angela, you are always flirting.
- Oh, Ian, don't be angry with me.

893
00:54:16,235 --> 00:54:20,202
I was really looking forward
to taking you to bed tonight.

894
00:54:20,285 --> 00:54:23,958
Sorry to interrupt.
There's Evan Macy over there. I love him.

895
00:54:24,042 --> 00:54:27,508
I'd give anything for his autograph, but
I don't want to seem obnoxious or nothing.

896
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:31,432
Well, I-I know him. We did a TV film together.
I could introduce you if you like.

897
00:54:31,472 --> 00:54:33,436
- No, really?
- Yeah, of course.

898
00:54:33,477 --> 00:54:35,440
Oh, yeah.

899
00:54:36,483 --> 00:54:38,445
So just imagine it, right?

900
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:40,491
I'm there with aces up.

901
00:54:40,575 --> 00:54:43,079
And he bets, bets big.

902
00:54:43,164 --> 00:54:47,129
All right. I see this
little tick in his cheek.

903
00:54:48,591 --> 00:54:52,515
I- I called him
for?0,000 and I won.

904
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:56,774
I've been playing poker
most of my life.

905
00:54:56,857 --> 00:54:58,819
And I can tell you it's a fact...

906
00:54:58,904 --> 00:55:01,867
there's more skill
to poker than chess.

907
00:55:01,952 --> 00:55:04,873
Martin Burns.
I'm a friend of John Fowler.

908
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,880
- John-
- The producer.

909
00:55:07,964 --> 00:55:10,426
We were at university together.

910
00:55:10,468 --> 00:55:14,142
In those days, I kept myself
in fine style playing poker.

911
00:55:14,226 --> 00:55:16,564
You obviously play
high stakes, Mr., uh-

912
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:19,696
Sometimes.

913
00:55:19,778 --> 00:55:22,951
I met my ex-wife
at a poker game years ago.

914
00:55:22,994 --> 00:55:26,041
When she left me, she said I neglected her
because I preferred playing.

915
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:30,258
It wasn't true.
But her lawyers used it as a strategy.

916
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,849
My dad taught me poker.

917
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:37,314
He was a poor man, ran a restaurant
down in the south coast.

918
00:55:37,356 --> 00:55:39,568
Taught me the ins and outs
of the game, lucky too.

919
00:55:39,652 --> 00:55:44,328
I could never have kept myself
on my expensive habits on his salary.

920
00:55:45,456 --> 00:55:47,667
Terry, Kate's looking for you.

921
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:50,965
Ian, Martin Burns.
My brother, Ian.

922
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:53,346
We've just discovered
we're both poker players.

923
00:55:53,387 --> 00:55:55,933
There's a wonderful game in town.
I'd invite you both to play...

924
00:55:56,018 --> 00:55:57,937
but I have to leave
right after the weekend.

925
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:58,819
This weekend?

926
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:02,322
Yeah. Seems I get to London
less and less these days.

927
00:56:02,364 --> 00:56:06,914
I thought I'd be here the month, but, uh,
seems my presence is required in California.

928
00:56:06,998 --> 00:56:09,754
Well, that's a great pity
if you had your heart set on staying.

929
00:56:09,836 --> 00:56:13,929
Ah, well, duty calls. And I will have time
to dine with my old mum before I go.

930
00:56:14,012 --> 00:56:17,687
She's 91. At that age,
you can go at any moment.

931
00:56:18,981 --> 00:56:21,736
Great old girl.
Let's hope I have her genes.

932
00:56:21,819 --> 00:56:23,698
To life.

933
00:56:25,201 --> 00:56:27,665
Good luck with the poker.

934
00:56:28,749 --> 00:56:31,338
- I'm stunned.
- You turned white as a ghost.

935
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,348
How long have you been talking to him?

936
00:56:33,384 --> 00:56:36,349
- A couple of minutes, I-I lost my breath.
- What about?

937
00:56:36,432 --> 00:56:39,355
Nothing. Uh, poker, life.

938
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,695
What are the chances of that? The last thing
we wanted to do was meet him, and then-

939
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:45,659
- What are the odds?
- You always said how unpredictable life is.

940
00:56:45,743 --> 00:56:48,247
How long will it take you
to get those guns made?

941
00:56:48,331 --> 00:56:50,668
- I can't do this, Ian.
- Look, Terry, you've been drinking.

942
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:53,174
You lose your confidence
when you're drunk.

943
00:56:53,258 --> 00:56:59,020
Listen. I can't keep begging you to do this
with me. He's leaving in a couple of days.

944
00:56:59,061 --> 00:57:02,443
- Are you in or out?
- I never said I wouldn't do it, right?

945
00:57:02,525 --> 00:57:05,405
Well, then, pull yourself together.

946
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,410
Ian.

947
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,045
I had such a wonderful time.

948
00:57:12,086 --> 00:57:15,718
Angela's lovely, ain't she?
She's not at all snobby.

949
00:57:15,803 --> 00:57:18,014
She said she'd take me shopping.

950
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:20,018
I love the way she dresses.

951
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,899
I thought it might be way
out of my range, but she said no.

952
00:57:22,941 --> 00:57:25,614
- What are you thinking?
- Nothing.

953
00:57:25,696 --> 00:57:28,202
Who was that man
you was talking to at the bar?

954
00:57:28,285 --> 00:57:30,916
- Is that Mr. Burns?
- How do you know Mr. Burns?

955
00:57:30,998 --> 00:57:33,964
I was introduced.
He's sweet, isn't he?

956
00:57:34,046 --> 00:57:35,968
Didn't he know
your Uncle Howard?

957
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:38,097
Is that what you was
talking to him about?

958
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,351
You told him
Howard was our uncle?

959
00:57:40,435 --> 00:57:43,692
It just seemed to come up, 'cause he's on
the board of one of Howard's foundations.

960
00:57:43,775 --> 00:57:47,657
That's what he said. Actually,
he was looking for you just before we left.

961
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:49,661
Well, why did you
have to mention it, Kate?

962
00:57:49,746 --> 00:57:54,171
What are you getting so upset for?
We spoke for two minutes if that.

963
00:57:54,255 --> 00:57:58,262
Although I did get the impression
he's got mixed feelings about your uncle.

964
00:57:58,345 --> 00:58:01,311
Yeah, he seemed a little sarcastic.
I could be wrong.

965
00:58:01,393 --> 00:58:04,609
Did-Did he, uh, imply
bad things about Howard?

966
00:58:04,692 --> 00:58:06,738
Yeah, I got that impression.

967
00:58:06,821 --> 00:58:09,660
Actually, he was really surprised
to hear that you were his nephew.

968
00:58:09,702 --> 00:58:11,664
Christ.

969
00:58:11,706 --> 00:58:14,045
Kate, my head's splitting.

970
00:58:14,127 --> 00:58:17,968
- You drank too much. Take some aspirin.
- I need my codeine.

971
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:21,851
- No, Terry, you can't mix with that stuff.
- Christ, where'd I put it?

972
00:58:21,892 --> 00:58:23,855
It's in the kitchen in the cupboard.

973
00:58:23,896 --> 00:58:25,817
Kate, what's it doing
in the cupboard in the-

974
00:58:25,858 --> 00:58:29,491
I leave it in a certain place for a certain reason.
I leave it in the medicine cabinet.

975
00:58:29,574 --> 00:58:31,830
Don't move things around, please.

976
00:58:33,374 --> 00:58:35,253
Jesus.

977
00:58:49,866 --> 00:58:52,787
Just pull it back...

978
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:55,710
- and let it go.
- Right.

979
00:59:13,204 --> 00:59:15,667
All right?

980
00:59:40,675 --> 00:59:42,595
This is his flat.

981
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,059
Ground floor.
It's right in the front.

982
00:59:45,141 --> 00:59:47,940
If we could get in there, we could
surprise him when he comes home.

983
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:49,943
All right.

984
00:59:51,947 --> 00:59:55,454
Right. I've got some tools
at the garage that can get us in.

985
00:59:55,538 --> 00:59:58,377
I think it's our best shot, Terry.

986
00:59:58,419 --> 01:00:01,258
- Let's do it tonight.
- Yeah? Are you up to it?

987
01:00:01,341 --> 01:00:03,387
- I can't stand the waiting around.
- No, you're right.

988
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:06,393
Look, he always eats out.
So we just need to get in there.

989
01:00:06,435 --> 01:00:09,733
And then we'll wait for him, and we'll
do him when he gets back from dinner.

990
01:00:10,944 --> 01:00:13,157
I hope I have the nerve
when the moment comes, Ian.

991
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:16,788
Don't let me down, Terry.
Look, it's simple.

992
01:00:16,873 --> 01:00:21,423
I'm gonna shoot him. And then you shoot him
again in the head, just to make certain.

993
01:00:21,465 --> 01:00:25,223
Or else you shoot him
and I'll finish him off.

994
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,609
Should have got a taxi, Ian. Had to give
your name and address and everything.

995
01:00:51,651 --> 01:00:55,073
No, no, no, no. We need a car standing by
in case something goes wrong.

996
01:00:55,115 --> 01:00:57,078
What could go wrong?
What are you saying?

997
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,125
I'm not saying something will go wrong,
but if something did go wrong...

998
01:01:00,209 --> 01:01:02,380
we need to have a car.

999
01:01:02,505 --> 01:01:04,759
Who's taking a taxi
if something goes wrong?

1000
01:01:14,195 --> 01:01:16,783
Here he is. Look.

1001
01:01:28,891 --> 01:01:30,854
All right, let's go.

1002
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:57,073
- Come on, Terry.
- Be quiet.

1003
01:02:36,235 --> 01:02:39,074
- We have to be careful of this window.
- Right.

1004
01:02:39,157 --> 01:02:41,745
Don't touch anything.

1005
01:02:41,788 --> 01:02:43,750
What do we do now?

1006
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:46,046
We just wait.

1007
01:02:52,893 --> 01:02:55,565
- Do you want some?
- No. Put it away, Terry.

1008
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,005
What's that?

1009
01:03:07,088 --> 01:03:09,301
Just leave it.
Don't answer it.

1010
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:13,226
Hello, this is Martin
Burns. I'm out. Leave a message after the tone.

1011
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:17,401
Hello, love. It's Mum.

1012
01:03:17,484 --> 01:03:23,037
Oh, sorry to miss you, but I've had to
change tomorrow's dinner to 7:00.

1013
01:03:23,121 --> 01:03:26,209
Looking forward to seeing you.
Bye for now.

1014
01:03:37,941 --> 01:03:40,863
Terry, what are you thinking?

1015
01:03:42,701 --> 01:03:44,955
What if there's a God, Ian?

1016
01:03:47,126 --> 01:03:50,801
I mean, what if...

1017
01:03:50,884 --> 01:03:56,854
all those nights we used to lay awake,
you know, in the dark...

1018
01:03:56,895 --> 01:04:01,197
and curse the fate
of every human soul...

1019
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,368
what if we was too angry?

1020
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:05,372
No. No.

1021
01:04:05,454 --> 01:04:08,586
Don't turn your back on what
you know in your heart to be true...

1022
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:10,841
just 'cause we're facing
a d- a difficult task.

1023
01:04:10,924 --> 01:04:13,054
Yeah, but we're
crossing the line here.

1024
01:04:13,137 --> 01:04:15,725
There's no going back from this.
I tell you, I've said it before.

1025
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:18,898
I don't wanna go back, Brother,
and neither do you.

1026
01:04:18,983 --> 01:04:22,196
- We need to look to the future.
- A taxi. It's him.

1027
01:04:22,281 --> 01:04:25,871
Right. All right. Now remember,
we wait till he gets in...

1028
01:04:25,954 --> 01:04:28,585
let him shut the door,
we let him get in the flat, right?

1029
01:04:28,668 --> 01:04:31,466
And then we come out quick,
surprise him, and then we just do it.

1030
01:04:31,549 --> 01:04:33,596
- Right.
- All right? We just do it.

1031
01:04:33,678 --> 01:04:35,599
Right.
Let's go.

1032
01:04:45,075 --> 01:04:48,040
The beef was nice, wasn't it?
Can I have a drink?

1033
01:04:48,081 --> 01:04:50,294
Yeah.

1034
01:04:51,963 --> 01:04:56,223
Oh, wow.
Look at that garden.

1035
01:04:56,348 --> 01:04:58,686
- Do you like it?
- It's gorgeous.

1036
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,690
It's nice.

1037
01:05:00,732 --> 01:05:04,365
- Do you look after it?
- No, the gardener does.

1038
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:11,378
- Christ.
- Terry, we're gonna have to do her too.

1039
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,092
- Not me. I'm not doing her.
- Well, then what we gonna do?

1040
01:05:14,175 --> 01:05:16,388
We've mucked it up.
I'm not doing the woman.

1041
01:05:16,472 --> 01:05:19,561
Okay, okay. You're right.
But what are we gonna do?

1042
01:05:22,191 --> 01:05:24,738
I can't kill her just because
she's here, Ian. It's wrong.

1043
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,910
All right. Look, I don't disagree.

1044
01:05:26,951 --> 01:05:28,955
Oh, Terry, are we screwed.

1045
01:05:32,421 --> 01:05:34,383
San Francisco, L.A.

1046
01:05:34,425 --> 01:05:36,387
Anyone traveling with you?

1047
01:05:36,429 --> 01:05:39,769
- No, I'm traveling on me own.
- Need a passenger?

1048
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:43,025
- Fancy a trip?
- I'd love to.

1049
01:05:52,921 --> 01:05:55,389
- Do you have what you came in for?
- Yes.

1050
01:05:55,425 --> 01:06:00,100
I'll be sleeping over at yours tonight.
I just need a change of clothes, and, uh-

1051
01:06:01,311 --> 01:06:04,067
uh, my laptop.

1052
01:06:06,613 --> 01:06:08,660
And we can go.

1053
01:06:13,168 --> 01:06:15,632
Okay.

1054
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:27,322
We'll have to do it tomorrow night at
his mother's. I can find out where she lives.

1055
01:06:27,363 --> 01:06:29,910
I was gonna do it, Ian. You saw me.
But then the woman arrived.

1056
01:06:29,994 --> 01:06:34,128
I would've done it, though.
You saw me, Ian. I was ready. Oh, Christ.

1057
01:06:40,222 --> 01:06:42,227
I told you I was only borrowing
this money from the safe.

1058
01:06:42,268 --> 01:06:44,523
I can't believe
you thought I was taking it.

1059
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,652
I told you it was just a loan.

1060
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:48,948
And, Dad, there's a nice,
big bonus in here for you.

1061
01:06:49,032 --> 01:06:52,456
Don't tell me that
won't come in handy.

1062
01:06:52,539 --> 01:06:54,960
Where'd you get
money like that, Ian?

1063
01:06:55,002 --> 01:06:57,967
You know, I'm involved
in certain business ventures.

1064
01:06:58,008 --> 01:06:59,971
What sort of
business ventures?

1065
01:07:00,012 --> 01:07:02,225
I told you. The hotels.

1066
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:07,027
Wait, I thought you said that
your hotel deals had been delayed.

1067
01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:09,658
Well, this is an advance.
Will you just take it?

1068
01:07:09,698 --> 01:07:12,161
- Where's it coming from?
- Will you just take it?

1069
01:07:12,204 --> 01:07:15,835
Look, soon this place will be back on its feet
and you won't be so dependent on me.

1070
01:07:15,877 --> 01:07:18,966
- Where are you going?
- Well, I'm not gonna work here forever.

1071
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:23,518
- Well, who's gonna run things?
- Oh, Dad, give me a break.

1072
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:26,648
Look.

1073
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:30,030
You know that- that I love you.

1074
01:07:30,072 --> 01:07:33,246
I mean, I've stuck it out here all these years,
even though it's not for me...

1075
01:07:33,328 --> 01:07:35,250
because of loyalty to you.

1076
01:07:35,332 --> 01:07:37,963
And I know that some of those business
plans in the past didn't pan out...

1077
01:07:38,046 --> 01:07:39,967
but this one is different, Dad.

1078
01:07:40,050 --> 01:07:41,971
This one is different.

1079
01:07:42,055 --> 01:07:44,643
And I'm just mad about the girl.

1080
01:07:49,987 --> 01:07:55,332
It's funny how life
has a life of its own.

1081
01:07:55,415 --> 01:07:58,045
- Oh, Dad, Dad-
- No, you're right, Ian.

1082
01:07:58,128 --> 01:08:01,427
Nobody wants to be selfish,
but everybody is.

1083
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,952
No, you're not.

1084
01:08:03,989 --> 01:08:06,395
I have been.

1085
01:08:06,437 --> 01:08:09,860
And it's because-
I think it's because I've been scared.

1086
01:08:11,238 --> 01:08:14,035
You're a good boy. I've always
thought you had potential.

1087
01:08:14,078 --> 01:08:16,791
You're both good boys,
you and your brother.

1088
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:20,590
I've always wanted
to make sure...

1089
01:08:20,673 --> 01:08:25,058
that I've loved you
and Terry absolutely equally.

1090
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,896
Well, you have,
you-you absolutely have.

1091
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:31,445
Dad, don't worry about a thing.

1092
01:08:31,529 --> 01:08:34,534
Everything's gonna be fine.

1093
01:08:34,618 --> 01:08:37,416
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

1094
01:08:37,498 --> 01:08:39,712
All right.

1095
01:08:44,471 --> 01:08:47,394
I thought I was pregnant.
It's a false alarm.

1096
01:08:47,477 --> 01:08:49,398
- Pregnant?
- Yeah.

1097
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:53,030
- I was late. I'm never late, am I?
- But you're not. That's a relief.

1098
01:08:53,113 --> 01:08:55,034
Why?

1099
01:08:55,117 --> 01:08:57,998
I think it would be great.
We always talked about it.

1100
01:08:58,035 --> 01:08:58,750
Yeah, some day.

1101
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:02,424
We can swing it. Now your
uncle's helped you out financially.

1102
01:09:02,507 --> 01:09:06,390
And you said that he might help you out
with that loan for that sport shop idea.

1103
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:10,482
I think you'd make such a good dad.

1104
01:09:10,565 --> 01:09:15,617
And just think, if we had boys, you know, you
could teach them to play football or something.

1105
01:09:15,658 --> 01:09:17,621
Right.

1106
01:09:19,626 --> 01:09:21,879
- You're not hungry?
- Not really, love.

1107
01:09:21,915 --> 01:09:24,133
- It's very nice.
- It's your favorite.

1108
01:09:24,176 --> 01:09:27,599
I know. Can I get
a whiskey, please?

1109
01:09:29,269 --> 01:09:31,189
- A whiskey?
- Yeah.

1110
01:09:31,273 --> 01:09:34,321
- I don't know if we got any left.
- It's in my drawer.

1111
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:52,524
- You're late.
- Sorry, sorry.

1112
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:54,862
Oh, Jesus Christ.
You've been drinking.

1113
01:09:54,945 --> 01:09:59,162
I'm fine. I said I'm fine.
Just leave it at that, all right?

1114
01:09:59,204 --> 01:10:01,250
Let's just do it, Brother,
before I change my mind.

1115
01:10:01,332 --> 01:10:04,338
- Have you got the guns?
- Here. Right here. And the bullets.

1116
01:10:04,381 --> 01:10:06,635
All right, all right.
Don't load them now.

1117
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,558
- Are you too drunk to handle this, Terry?
- I said I'm fine.

1118
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,979
- All right, let's just go.
- Right.

1119
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:14,359
We'll go up to him when
he's on his own, we shoot him...

1120
01:10:14,401 --> 01:10:16,655
and then I'll put a second one
in him just to make certain.

1121
01:10:16,697 --> 01:10:19,953
I know what to do, Ian. Right?
You don't always have to run things.

1122
01:10:20,038 --> 01:10:23,628
- Can you handle this, the state you're in?
- Worry about yourself.

1123
01:10:23,711 --> 01:10:27,009
All right? I'll take care of him. Just-

1124
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:29,849
- Have you got the address?
- Yeah, I've got it. Let's get this over with.

1125
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:39,243
Don't worry about the restaurant.

1126
01:10:39,326 --> 01:10:42,123
I can help you if you need me.

1127
01:10:46,465 --> 01:10:48,678
I dreamed about the boys last night.

1128
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:50,683
Again?

1129
01:10:52,727 --> 01:10:55,608
When they were younger.

1130
01:11:13,644 --> 01:11:16,024
There he is.
Let's take him now.

1131
01:11:16,108 --> 01:11:18,696
Wait. You don't wanna let him
see his mum for the last time?

1132
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:20,700
- What?
- You make me sick.

1133
01:11:20,783 --> 01:11:22,914
Let him see the old lady.

1134
01:11:22,996 --> 01:11:26,879
You're drunk, Terry. It's a disgrace
turning up on a job like this drunk.

1135
01:11:26,962 --> 01:11:29,133
Look, we've probably missed
our last opportunity now.

1136
01:11:29,218 --> 01:11:31,263
We'll get him
when he comes out.

1137
01:11:31,304 --> 01:11:35,480
Christ. You don't care about anyone
in this world except yourself.

1138
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:38,653
You're not a big shot, Ian.
You're a small stakes player.

1139
01:11:38,736 --> 01:11:41,909
I don't care how many hotels you wind up
running or how hot that girl is.

1140
01:11:41,992 --> 01:11:43,955
Why don't you shut up?

1141
01:11:43,997 --> 01:11:47,295
I bet you had a big handful of those pills
that guy keeps you supplied with as well.

1142
01:11:47,379 --> 01:11:49,759
I'm fine.

1143
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:51,971
We'll kill him
when he comes out.

1144
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,150
- Mr. Burns.
- Hey?

1145
01:14:03,233 --> 01:14:05,906
Oh, that's right. I remember you.
We met at that, uh, party.

1146
01:14:05,947 --> 01:14:08,911
- Yeah. We-We thought it was you.
- I understand you're Howard Swann's nephews.

1147
01:14:08,954 --> 01:14:09,376
That's right.

1148
01:14:09,413 --> 01:14:11,333
What are you doing around here?
You live around here?

1149
01:14:11,417 --> 01:14:13,379
- No. Ian?
- Do it now.

1150
01:14:13,462 --> 01:14:15,425
- Let's just do it now.
- Hey, what's going on?

1151
01:14:15,466 --> 01:14:18,640
Terry, do it! Do it now!

1152
01:14:39,389 --> 01:14:41,478
What are you thinking?

1153
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:46,112
That then was then.

1154
01:14:47,907 --> 01:14:50,078
And now is now.

1155
01:14:51,121 --> 01:14:53,709
And we've done it and it's over.

1156
01:14:56,005 --> 01:14:58,176
And it's always now.

1157
01:14:59,303 --> 01:15:02,644
It went much smoother
than I thought, Ian.

1158
01:15:02,685 --> 01:15:05,232
And not a soul around.

1159
01:15:05,316 --> 01:15:07,695
We're lucky he chose that path.

1160
01:15:07,779 --> 01:15:09,908
Yeah, no one saw us.

1161
01:15:09,991 --> 01:15:12,247
And we did the right thing.

1162
01:15:12,329 --> 01:15:15,754
We didn't run back to the car.
We just walked calmly back.

1163
01:15:15,837 --> 01:15:17,758
Yeah.

1164
01:15:17,841 --> 01:15:20,721
There's a great weight off my back.

1165
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:24,479
You're right, Ian.

1166
01:15:24,564 --> 01:15:27,317
It's now.

1167
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:29,656
It's always now.

1168
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:33,915
You better burn his wallet.

1169
01:15:52,368 --> 01:15:54,999
- Are you okay?
- Go back to sleep.

1170
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:18,838
- What do you think of this one?
- Oh, I love it.

1171
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:22,887
I thought you would. So, are there
any new developments on California?

1172
01:16:22,971 --> 01:16:26,687
Yeah, I think we can leave in about four
or six weeks. We signed the papers today.

1173
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:28,816
Great. Did you see in the papers...

1174
01:16:28,899 --> 01:16:33,075
that guy that you were speaking to
at the wrap party was murdered?

1175
01:16:33,158 --> 01:16:36,748
- Who?
- Martin- Martin Burns, was it?

1176
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:39,421
Oh, really?
How bizarre.

1177
01:16:39,504 --> 01:16:42,343
Yeah, well, no one
saw or heard anything.

1178
01:16:42,427 --> 01:16:45,057
Didn't he have some association
with your uncle at one point?

1179
01:16:45,093 --> 01:16:45,808
I think he did, yeah.

1180
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,858
- What do you think of this one?
- As if you have to ask.

1181
01:16:59,544 --> 01:17:03,886
You know, I'll never forget you boys,
what you did for me.

1182
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:05,849
I owe you my life.

1183
01:17:05,974 --> 01:17:10,107
And the joy of repaying you
gives me such pleasure.

1184
01:17:10,191 --> 01:17:13,949
Now, Terry, you-
Look, you spoke about, uh...

1185
01:17:14,032 --> 01:17:18,499
you know, the notion of opening a-
a sports shop if you had the backing?

1186
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:21,297
No, it's okay.

1187
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:24,302
No, look. Look, cheer up.

1188
01:17:24,387 --> 01:17:29,061
The worst is behind you. I'm here
to tell you that the- the future is rosy.

1189
01:17:30,147 --> 01:17:32,402
Terry, Uncle Howard's right.

1190
01:17:32,484 --> 01:17:34,823
Stop walking around
with that face on.

1191
01:17:34,907 --> 01:17:38,372
This is your chance to get away
from that cheap idiot at the garage...

1192
01:17:38,455 --> 01:17:40,918
and make your own life.

1193
01:17:41,003 --> 01:17:43,047
- Where are they? Is that them?
- Yes.

1194
01:17:43,132 --> 01:17:47,181
- Angela, I'm so nervous.
- You're fine. They'll love you.

1195
01:17:47,222 --> 01:17:50,646
- Hello.
- Hello. Oh, it's nice to see you, sir. I'm Ian.

1196
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:52,693
Nice to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.

1197
01:17:52,775 --> 01:17:55,615
- Hello. You have a nice trip?
- Very good, thank you.

1198
01:17:55,656 --> 01:17:58,120
- Let me take your bag.
- We've been really looking forward to this.

1199
01:17:58,202 --> 01:18:01,502
- Yeah, it'll be great.
- Your hair.

1200
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:05,552
- So how's your play doing, love?
- It's going well. It's still selling out at weekends.

1201
01:18:05,588 --> 01:18:08,807
- Oh, well, that's to see you take your clothes off.
- Mom!

1202
01:18:08,892 --> 01:18:11,104
- So what do you do, Ian?
- Uh, hotels.

1203
01:18:11,188 --> 01:18:14,611
- Hotels? Which ones?
- Yeah, I got a couple in, uh, California.

1204
01:18:14,694 --> 01:18:17,576
Oh, yes, Angela said you were
planning an extended stay out there.

1205
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,373
- Well, very extended, I hope.
- California.

1206
01:18:20,457 --> 01:18:22,377
I'm starving. Where are we eating?

1207
01:18:22,461 --> 01:18:25,509
- I'm taking you all to Claridge's.
- Oh, is it nice?

1208
01:18:25,592 --> 01:18:27,972
- Lovely.
- No, it's on us, though.

1209
01:18:28,013 --> 01:18:29,976
No, no, no.
This treat is on me. Yeah.

1210
01:18:30,017 --> 01:18:31,985
Oh, thank you.
Very nice of you.

1211
01:18:32,022 --> 01:18:34,151
Oh, they're really lovely,
your parents. Lovely.

1212
01:18:34,193 --> 01:18:36,405
- Oh, I can't get California out of my mind.
- I know.

1213
01:18:36,489 --> 01:18:40,622
I've spoken to Uncle Howard
and everything is right on track.

1214
01:18:43,544 --> 01:18:45,715
Thank you.

1215
01:18:45,798 --> 01:18:48,303
- She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Very, very.

1216
01:18:48,386 --> 01:18:51,017
A bit high maintenance, though.

1217
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:55,735
- You up to it?
- I certainly hope so.

1218
01:18:55,818 --> 01:18:58,157
She could've had
the pick of any man, that girl.

1219
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,661
Well, I realize I'm very lucky.
I do realize that.

1220
01:19:00,787 --> 01:19:06,716
I always dreaded the thought that she might
wind up with some starving actor in the theater.

1221
01:19:06,757 --> 01:19:09,262
Not that I've anything
against the theater, mind you...

1222
01:19:09,304 --> 01:19:14,522
but... a man who knows his way
around the world of business, well-

1223
01:19:14,606 --> 01:19:17,987
There was a time when I could've
invested in some ventures...

1224
01:19:18,072 --> 01:19:22,246
but I didn't have
the stomach for the risk.

1225
01:19:22,330 --> 01:19:27,758
So I spent my life behind the wheel
of a car driving other men.

1226
01:19:30,596 --> 01:19:33,268
She says you've got a future.

1227
01:19:36,484 --> 01:19:38,488
Oh, God.

1228
01:19:38,571 --> 01:19:41,284
- What is it?
- I can't take it.

1229
01:19:41,369 --> 01:19:44,250
- Take it easy. It's all right.
- I need another pill.

1230
01:19:44,291 --> 01:19:47,130
No, Terry. You can't take so many
of those, not with all that alcohol.

1231
01:19:47,213 --> 01:19:51,347
Kate, leave me alone.
I've gotta get rid of this feeling of panic.

1232
01:19:51,431 --> 01:19:54,144
- Why should you be feeling panicked?
- I don't know.

1233
01:19:54,228 --> 01:19:57,861
I just need the pill. Christ,
I can't even get a decent night's sleep.

1234
01:19:57,943 --> 01:20:00,322
All right.

1235
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:05,624
My car didn't have that dent
when I brought it in.

1236
01:20:05,666 --> 01:20:09,007
- It had to have been there. Nobody's touched it.
- No, you put a dent in my car.

1237
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:11,344
- How the hell would I dent it?
- I don't know.

1238
01:20:11,428 --> 01:20:12,101
What's going on?

1239
01:20:12,138 --> 01:20:14,684
There's a dent, look, in my car. Someone's driven my car.

1240
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:17,440
- Will you shut up? What are you accusing me of?
- Someone has to have driven it.

1241
01:20:17,482 --> 01:20:19,444
Look where you point your finger.
It could get broken.

1242
01:20:19,486 --> 01:20:21,448
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Get your hands off me.

1243
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:23,453
Sorry, Mr. Finn.
Just give us a minute.

1244
01:20:23,494 --> 01:20:25,456
I'll sort out
your bodywork for you.

1245
01:20:25,498 --> 01:20:28,087
I need a word with you.
What the hell's the matter with you?

1246
01:20:28,128 --> 01:20:32,220
Look, I'm not at all pleased with the way
things are going around here lately. All right?

1247
01:20:32,303 --> 01:20:34,599
Hey! There's another one here.

1248
01:20:37,522 --> 01:20:40,487
Yeah, I miss you too.

1249
01:20:40,528 --> 01:20:43,618
Nobu. Yeah, I made
reservations for after the show.

1250
01:20:44,577 --> 01:20:48,502
Who's that?
Look, I'll see you later. All right? Bye.

1251
01:20:51,174 --> 01:20:53,513
- Hey. Are you all right?
- I need to speak to you.

1252
01:20:53,554 --> 01:20:57,396
Well, I wish you'd called first. I'm expecting
some guys over for a conference call.

1253
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:59,442
I'm having bad thoughts.

1254
01:20:59,525 --> 01:21:01,446
What kind of bad thoughts?

1255
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:05,829
We did a terrible thing, Ian.

1256
01:21:05,912 --> 01:21:10,212
- Oh, Jesus, can you just get past it?
- I'm trying.

1257
01:21:10,296 --> 01:21:14,138
- I should never have let you talk me into it.
- I didn't.

1258
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:18,019
Terry, you needed his help.
Loan sharks were gonna break your legs...

1259
01:21:18,102 --> 01:21:20,023
and maybe even Kate's as well.

1260
01:21:20,107 --> 01:21:22,863
But Martin Burns...

1261
01:21:22,904 --> 01:21:26,036
we stepped on him
like he was an insect.

1262
01:21:26,119 --> 01:21:28,290
Look, Terry,
I can't discuss this now.

1263
01:21:28,373 --> 01:21:32,465
I've got two guys and a transatlantic
conference call coming up.

1264
01:21:32,549 --> 01:21:35,221
I can't go on like this.

1265
01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:37,893
Let's talk about it later.
Why aren't you at the garage?

1266
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:40,314
- I got let go.
- What does that mean?

1267
01:21:40,357 --> 01:21:46,243
The boss said,
uh, I-I should take some time off.

1268
01:21:46,284 --> 01:21:49,541
He thinks I've been under a lot of strain
lately. Thanks for denting the Jaguar.

1269
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:53,090
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to tell you.

1270
01:21:53,173 --> 01:21:56,847
Look. You've gotta relax. All right?

1271
01:21:56,931 --> 01:21:59,144
Lay off the booze and the pills.

1272
01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:01,148
No wonder you're
getting yourself in trouble.

1273
01:22:01,231 --> 01:22:03,235
I can't get through the day without drinking.

1274
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:06,325
Look, you've got to go home.
All right? Rest up.

1275
01:22:06,408 --> 01:22:08,872
I'll call you later,
we'll get together, all right?

1276
01:22:08,913 --> 01:22:11,377
You've gotta ease up.
You'll give yourself a bloody heart attack.

1277
01:22:11,459 --> 01:22:13,423
Then I'll die. So I'll die.

1278
01:22:13,506 --> 01:22:16,304
Don't talk like that.
What's the matter with you?

1279
01:22:18,015 --> 01:22:20,144
- Guys, come in, please.
- Lovely.

1280
01:22:21,939 --> 01:22:25,070
Look, I'll call you later.
I'm gonna get you past this, okay?

1281
01:22:25,155 --> 01:22:27,242
All right.

1282
01:22:35,842 --> 01:22:38,179
See, this is more like it,
Terry, isn't it?

1283
01:22:38,263 --> 01:22:40,184
Getting out of the house.

1284
01:22:40,267 --> 01:22:44,609
Can't sit around there too much.
Too much thinking.

1285
01:22:44,652 --> 01:22:47,657
Kate said you're not even
talking about poker anymore.

1286
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:49,661
Where's our old Terry?

1287
01:22:49,744 --> 01:22:52,083
- I mean, you're a gambler. This is you.
- Yeah.

1288
01:22:52,124 --> 01:22:54,295
I'm not suggesting you
go mad or anything, but-

1289
01:22:54,379 --> 01:22:56,759
I'm not the same Terry, Ian.

1290
01:22:56,801 --> 01:22:59,847
- I can't be anymore.
- No, you just have to focus.

1291
01:22:59,932 --> 01:23:02,103
Look, I-I been thinking
that you getting the sack...

1292
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:04,316
is maybe the best thing
that ever happened to you.

1293
01:23:04,352 --> 01:23:04,441
What?

1294
01:23:04,524 --> 01:23:08,699
Yeah. Now is the perfect time to start
thinking about setting up the sport shop.

1295
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:12,958
I mean, Uncle Howard said he would
start you off. You'd be your own boss.

1296
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:17,258
No more kowtowing to
superiors. And you love sports.

1297
01:23:17,295 --> 01:23:17,633
I do.

1298
01:23:17,676 --> 01:23:21,266
Maybe you're right, Ian.
Maybe what I need is just a big change.

1299
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:24,523
Yeah, you need to focus on something
substantial. You can't just do nothing.

1300
01:23:24,607 --> 01:23:26,610
- Yeah.
- Hey?

1301
01:23:26,652 --> 01:23:28,614
I think I'll do it, Ian.

1302
01:23:28,656 --> 01:23:31,662
Yeah, it's just exactly what you need, Terry.

1303
01:23:31,746 --> 01:23:36,129
Get off the booze and the pills
and set up your own place.

1304
01:23:36,171 --> 01:23:38,175
Right, and not just sporting goods.

1305
01:23:38,259 --> 01:23:40,179
Exercise equipment.

1306
01:23:40,263 --> 01:23:42,184
- That's where the money is today.
- Yeah?

1307
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:45,190
Yeah. Helping people set up
their own private gyms and stuff.

1308
01:23:45,273 --> 01:23:47,194
I like the way
you're thinking, Terry.

1309
01:23:47,276 --> 01:23:49,614
'Cause you're thinking forwards.
You're not lookin' back.

1310
01:23:49,651 --> 01:23:50,115
That's right.

1311
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:52,119
- You've got a really good future, Terry.
- Yeah?

1312
01:23:52,203 --> 01:23:55,417
You do. Listen, I'm not saying
that I haven't had moments...

1313
01:23:55,501 --> 01:23:58,131
where I've thought about what we've done,
and it's freaked me out.

1314
01:23:58,173 --> 01:24:00,177
- Go on!
- We were raised to know right from wrong.

1315
01:24:00,259 --> 01:24:02,181
- Go on!
- Did you get that one?

1316
01:24:02,264 --> 01:24:05,229
Look at this.
I got a winner.

1317
01:24:05,313 --> 01:24:07,901
It's the beginning
of a new streak, Terry.

1318
01:24:07,985 --> 01:24:09,905
I can feel it, Ian.

1319
01:24:13,705 --> 01:24:17,044
Could-Could you get this model
with the same interior in a left-hand drive...

1320
01:24:17,086 --> 01:24:20,551
- say, in California, for instance?
- For California. Yeah, certainly.

1321
01:24:20,635 --> 01:24:22,555
And would there be
a long waiting list or-

1322
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:24,559
I would think about
three or four months.

1323
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:27,149
- Oh, can I?
- Please do.

1324
01:24:40,591 --> 01:24:44,683
Hey, great scene.
You really nailed it.

1325
01:24:44,725 --> 01:24:48,148
- You were great. You were great tonight.
- Do you think so?

1326
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:52,783
The bedroom scenes
were so sexy as always.

1327
01:24:52,867 --> 01:24:56,582
Well, I was doing it with him,
but I was thinking of you for motivation.

1328
01:25:00,255 --> 01:25:03,680
Don't forget. Tomorrow is Lord Eisley's party.
He's invited the whole cast.

1329
01:25:03,763 --> 01:25:05,975
Yeah. I'm gonna keep
my eye on you like a hawk.

1330
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:10,109
You know, his son's a notorious playboy, and
I think he's asked everyone just to get you there.

1331
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:12,697
- Uh, what's that?
- Nothing.

1332
01:25:12,781 --> 01:25:13,621
Show me.

1333
01:25:13,658 --> 01:25:16,204
I got you these. Remember?
You liked them in the shop.

1334
01:25:16,246 --> 01:25:20,254
Oh, my God. They must have cost you a fortune.

1335
01:25:22,425 --> 01:25:25,723
- Hello?
- I need to speak to you, Ian.

1336
01:25:27,435 --> 01:25:30,899
Kate, Kate, Kate, calm down.
What's the matter?

1337
01:25:30,942 --> 01:25:34,450
It's Terry. I really need to speak to you.

1338
01:25:34,532 --> 01:25:36,244
What, now?

1339
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:38,457
Yeah, now. Is it possible?

1340
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:41,839
Well, look,
I'll see what I can do.

1341
01:25:41,922 --> 01:25:43,843
I'll call you back,
all right?

1342
01:25:43,926 --> 01:25:48,101
- Is everything all right?
- Angela, I have to go to my brother's for a while.

1343
01:25:48,186 --> 01:25:50,523
- There's a little family problem.
- It's nothing serious, I hope.

1344
01:25:50,607 --> 01:25:52,694
No. That was Kate.
You remember? You met her.

1345
01:25:52,778 --> 01:25:55,700
It's just something's come up.
I'll see you back at yours in a while.

1346
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:59,625
Well, hurry. I want to show you
my gratitude for the earrings.

1347
01:26:01,127 --> 01:26:04,676
All right. See you later, all right?

1348
01:26:06,472 --> 01:26:08,392
I'm worried about Terry, Ian.

1349
01:26:08,476 --> 01:26:10,605
What's the matter?

1350
01:26:10,647 --> 01:26:12,609
It's his mental health.

1351
01:26:12,652 --> 01:26:15,198
No, I know he was worried
about losing his job...

1352
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:18,831
but we were just at the racetrack,
and he talked about starting the sport shop.

1353
01:26:18,913 --> 01:26:21,417
No, he's not
interested in that.

1354
01:26:21,460 --> 01:26:23,421
And now he's angry all the time.

1355
01:26:23,463 --> 01:26:25,968
- He's talking to himself, for God's sake.
- No, we decided.

1356
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:29,725
He was gonna speak to Uncle Howard
about bankrolling it. He was very excited.

1357
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,064
His mind's not right, Ian.

1358
01:26:32,148 --> 01:26:34,527
You know, what he says one minute
doesn't mean anything the next.

1359
01:26:34,611 --> 01:26:37,784
Right. Well, I'm- I'm taken aback.

1360
01:26:37,825 --> 01:26:40,706
It's all the pills he's taking,
and the drinking.

1361
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:43,336
He thinks
he's killed someone.

1362
01:26:46,384 --> 01:26:47,846
- What?
- Yeah.

1363
01:26:47,888 --> 01:26:51,436
You know, I knew this girl once,
she had, like, mental problems.

1364
01:26:51,561 --> 01:26:54,234
She was convinced that
she had run someone over. She hadn't.

1365
01:26:54,317 --> 01:26:57,239
You know, but she was obsessed
with it for the rest of her life.

1366
01:26:57,323 --> 01:27:00,496
Does he, uh-
Is he going around...

1367
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:05,130
talking- talking
about this, uh, murder?

1368
01:27:05,215 --> 01:27:09,014
He's gotten worse and worse.
He has these terrible nightmares.

1369
01:27:09,055 --> 01:27:12,187
He's uncommunicative,
face of doom all the time, bouts of crying.

1370
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:15,318
When we were at the dog track,
he seemed to have come out of it.

1371
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:18,491
When he come home,
he was straight back in it.

1372
01:27:18,574 --> 01:27:22,750
You know, it's just- it's obsession
that he's done this horrible thing.

1373
01:27:22,875 --> 01:27:25,046
And he- he won't
let me get a doctor.

1374
01:27:25,087 --> 01:27:28,177
No, no, don't do that.
Don't-Don't get a doctor.

1375
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:32,562
If you get a doctor,
then it can- I'll deal with this.

1376
01:27:32,602 --> 01:27:33,026
Well, how?

1377
01:27:33,062 --> 01:27:35,901
Well, obviously, it's a bit
more serious than I thought...

1378
01:27:35,985 --> 01:27:40,409
but... if you get a doctor,
it could spiral out of control.

1379
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:43,290
- I really think he should see a doctor.
- Don't get a doctor, Kate. Don't.

1380
01:27:43,373 --> 01:27:47,716
Because I know Terry, and it will
only make things worse. All right?

1381
01:27:47,756 --> 01:27:51,765
Just- I'm gonna be
in the countryside tomorrow, all right?

1382
01:27:51,849 --> 01:27:54,854
And then when I come back, I'll spend
some time with Terry, and it'll be-

1383
01:27:54,938 --> 01:27:56,859
You'll see. It'll be all right.

1384
01:27:56,942 --> 01:27:59,197
Well, where you gonna be
if I need you though?

1385
01:27:59,238 --> 01:28:01,534
I'll let you know my whereabouts,
then you can call me.

1386
01:28:01,619 --> 01:28:03,873
I'll come-
I'll come straight back.

1387
01:28:06,795 --> 01:28:09,927
- So you're a fan of the Greek tragedies too?
- Love them. Crazy about them.

1388
01:28:09,968 --> 01:28:12,765
It's just rare that I could ever
get the chance to act in one.

1389
01:28:12,849 --> 01:28:15,313
God, I know. It's difficult, isn't it?
Which is your favorite, Ian?

1390
01:28:15,355 --> 01:28:17,818
Oh, I'm not really
that-that familiar.

1391
01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:20,322
Oh, well. Mine's always been Medea,
Euripides.

1392
01:28:20,406 --> 01:28:24,498
Yeah, me too. I think Clytemnestra's
probably the best character...

1393
01:28:24,581 --> 01:28:26,501
- of all classical plays.
- Yeah.

1394
01:28:26,585 --> 01:28:28,965
I have to say, the best productions
of Greek myths I've ever seen-

1395
01:28:29,049 --> 01:28:31,303
better than anything you'll find
on the stage-was done in dance...

1396
01:28:31,387 --> 01:28:33,599
- by the Martha Graham troupe, you know them?
- Really?

1397
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,939
Yeah. I mean, all the terror was there,
all the Aristotelian pity and fear.

1398
01:28:37,023 --> 01:28:39,861
It's so much more visceral
in dance, don't you think?

1399
01:28:39,897 --> 01:28:40,112
Right.

1400
01:28:40,196 --> 01:28:42,576
- Mr. Blaine? Your brother's here.
- Yeah?

1401
01:28:42,660 --> 01:28:44,580
- What?
- He'd like to see you.

1402
01:28:44,664 --> 01:28:48,044
Oh. Uh...

1403
01:28:48,087 --> 01:28:50,049
could you give me a moment?

1404
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:51,099
Yeah, sure. Bring him in.

1405
01:28:51,135 --> 01:28:53,347
It must be pretty bad if he's
driven all the way out here.

1406
01:28:53,431 --> 01:28:58,022
No, I- Uh- It's just a little
family problem. I won't be long.

1407
01:29:00,485 --> 01:29:02,656
- Oh, I'm sure it's nothing.
- I'm sure.

1408
01:29:04,368 --> 01:29:06,665
- Your brother's there, Mr. Blaine.
- Thanks.

1409
01:29:14,806 --> 01:29:19,232
Terry, what are you doing here?
How did you know where I was?

1410
01:29:19,315 --> 01:29:21,236
Kate had the address.

1411
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:24,242
- I need to tell you something.
- Well, just keep your voice down.

1412
01:29:24,325 --> 01:29:27,749
I don't want anyone overhearing.
Why didn't you just give me a phone?

1413
01:29:27,832 --> 01:29:30,671
- I want to turn myself in, Ian.
- What?

1414
01:29:30,755 --> 01:29:32,969
- We broke God's law.
- God?

1415
01:29:33,051 --> 01:29:36,767
Terry, what God?
What God, you idiot?

1416
01:29:36,851 --> 01:29:38,771
I shouldn't have let you
talk me into it.

1417
01:29:38,854 --> 01:29:42,780
- I didn't talk you into it. Stop deluding yourself.
- I want this off my neck.

1418
01:29:42,862 --> 01:29:45,326
Look, you can't do this,
Terry, all right?

1419
01:29:45,409 --> 01:29:49,166
You can't do it. You'd be throwing your whole
life away, and mine and Uncle Howard's.

1420
01:29:49,209 --> 01:29:52,048
I won't implicate
you and Howard.

1421
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:55,013
- You won't-
- This is my personal decision.

1422
01:29:55,054 --> 01:29:57,475
- You won't be able to keep us out of it.
- I will.

1423
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:59,479
No, you're upset.
You're unstable.

1424
01:29:59,564 --> 01:30:01,483
Your lies will be all transparent.

1425
01:30:01,568 --> 01:30:04,406
- I've thought about suicide, Ian.
- But why?

1426
01:30:04,448 --> 01:30:06,410
Stop asking the same
questions over and over.

1427
01:30:06,452 --> 01:30:08,999
Go and commit suicide,
and leave Howard and me out of it.

1428
01:30:09,082 --> 01:30:12,379
I just want the slate wiped clean.

1429
01:30:12,463 --> 01:30:14,759
Look. You're depressed.

1430
01:30:14,843 --> 01:30:17,639
You're just suffering
from a little depression, that's all.

1431
01:30:17,681 --> 01:30:21,732
- Kate wants me to see a doctor.
- No, no. Look, I can help you. If you'll just let me.

1432
01:30:21,769 --> 01:30:26,784
I just want to tell someone. Go in
and serve my punishment. Have it off me.

1433
01:30:26,825 --> 01:30:32,002
Just give me a minute. Give me a minute
to get my thoughts in order, will you?

1434
01:30:32,087 --> 01:30:36,010
I wish you could come with me.
But if you won't, I understand.

1435
01:30:36,052 --> 01:30:39,058
Just give me a minute.

1436
01:30:39,142 --> 01:30:42,273
- I feel less panic since I made this decision.
- Hi.

1437
01:30:42,356 --> 01:30:45,863
You okay?
Are you gonna join us?

1438
01:30:45,948 --> 01:30:49,830
Terry and I are just discussing a little problem.
Everything will be all right.

1439
01:30:49,913 --> 01:30:52,293
Just had to talk
to Ian about something.

1440
01:30:52,334 --> 01:30:54,297
- You sure?
- Yes.

1441
01:30:54,339 --> 01:30:57,053
You go on, I'll only be a minute.

1442
01:30:57,136 --> 01:30:59,057
Okay.

1443
01:31:03,064 --> 01:31:06,489
She's very beautiful.
She'd make a great wife for you.

1444
01:31:06,530 --> 01:31:07,198
Look, Terry.

1445
01:31:07,282 --> 01:31:09,578
Terry, listen to me.
I want to help you. I do.

1446
01:31:09,619 --> 01:31:11,582
But this is not
the time or the place.

1447
01:31:11,666 --> 01:31:13,795
- I'm sorry for barging in.
- No, no, it's all right. It's all right.

1448
01:31:13,878 --> 01:31:17,302
Look, I want to hear what you've got to say.
We're family. You're my brother.

1449
01:31:17,343 --> 01:31:19,640
Yeah, we can talk, but you're
not gonna change my mind.

1450
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:24,901
Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe you'll even
change mine. But just promise me one thing.

1451
01:31:25,026 --> 01:31:28,281
We've gotta have a discussion
about this before you plunge ahead.

1452
01:31:28,323 --> 01:31:30,870
- Promise?
- Promise. Can I come in and get a drink?

1453
01:31:30,953 --> 01:31:32,874
No, that's not a good idea.

1454
01:31:32,957 --> 01:31:36,547
- You go. I'll give you a call tonight.
- Right.

1455
01:31:40,764 --> 01:31:42,811
Call me tonight.

1456
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:06,817
I just don't see any alternative.

1457
01:32:08,195 --> 01:32:10,324
What are we saying?

1458
01:32:10,408 --> 01:32:15,961
Well, I don't know what we're saying.
We're-We're saying we want to survive.

1459
01:32:17,171 --> 01:32:19,384
But he's family.

1460
01:32:19,469 --> 01:32:21,430
Terry. He's my brother.

1461
01:32:21,513 --> 01:32:23,434
Well, I-I know that.

1462
01:32:23,518 --> 01:32:29,028
But he has to be stopped before he-
this whole thing unravels.

1463
01:32:29,065 --> 01:32:31,533
Yeah, I can't-
I can't let that happen.

1464
01:32:31,618 --> 01:32:33,579
No.

1465
01:32:33,662 --> 01:32:36,084
No, I-

1466
01:32:36,168 --> 01:32:38,381
It's killing again.

1467
01:32:38,464 --> 01:32:40,885
How am I gonna do that?

1468
01:32:42,013 --> 01:32:44,684
It's deja vu,
but a thousand times worse.

1469
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:46,687
Speed is of the essence.

1470
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:51,197
Terry could be doing something awful
while we sit here and curse our fate.

1471
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,495
He was right about one thing.

1472
01:32:54,538 --> 01:32:57,669
It was like crossing a line.

1473
01:32:57,752 --> 01:32:59,840
There was no way back.

1474
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:03,806
It has to be made
to look like an accident.

1475
01:33:03,889 --> 01:33:09,150
Yeah. Yeah,
an accident or a suicide.

1476
01:33:11,572 --> 01:33:13,742
Well, he just broods.

1477
01:33:13,784 --> 01:33:16,915
You know, he sits there
talking to himself.

1478
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,590
He imagines that you and him
have got some dark secret.

1479
01:33:20,673 --> 01:33:23,387
You know, that you've
harmed someone or something.

1480
01:33:24,472 --> 01:33:27,103
Ian, I think
he's gonna hurt himself.

1481
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:32,990
Let me be alone
with him, Kate.

1482
01:33:33,072 --> 01:33:34,994
Yeah.

1483
01:33:54,074 --> 01:33:56,078
Terry.

1484
01:33:59,376 --> 01:34:03,717
- Terry.
- I had a dream about Martin Burns.

1485
01:34:17,997 --> 01:34:20,543
Terry, listen to me.

1486
01:34:20,626 --> 01:34:22,922
I dreamed again...

1487
01:34:23,007 --> 01:34:24,927
about Martin Burns.

1488
01:34:26,054 --> 01:34:28,517
You need a couple of days
away from all this.

1489
01:34:29,728 --> 01:34:33,694
Get some fresh air,
some sea air...

1490
01:34:33,777 --> 01:34:35,781
just the two of us.

1491
01:34:35,866 --> 01:34:38,537
We'll go out on the boat
again tomorrow.

1492
01:34:38,621 --> 01:34:41,627
- We never go sailing anymore, Ian.
- That's what I'm saying.

1493
01:34:42,963 --> 01:34:46,471
We'll take some sandwiches
and some beers...

1494
01:34:46,511 --> 01:34:51,103
and we'll just talk,
brother to brother.

1495
01:34:51,188 --> 01:34:53,150
I'd like that.

1496
01:34:54,152 --> 01:34:57,722
I wish you could see
my point of view.

1497
01:34:57,758 --> 01:35:01,291
It'll be great.
Just the two of us.

1498
01:35:02,795 --> 01:35:07,178
I think Angela said she was
taking Kate shopping tomorrow.

1499
01:35:07,303 --> 01:35:10,852
She said she was gonna
help her out with her style.

1500
01:35:10,888 --> 01:35:11,103
Yeah.

1501
01:35:11,187 --> 01:35:13,441
And we'll just relax, yeah?

1502
01:35:13,566 --> 01:35:17,155
Get some sun.
Maybe we can have a swim.

1503
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:19,451
You'll feel so much better
when you've had some sea air.

1504
01:35:19,536 --> 01:35:22,667
Yeah, but we'll never
be our old selves again, Ian, right?

1505
01:35:22,709 --> 01:35:25,088
I mean, there's no going back.

1506
01:35:27,552 --> 01:35:31,518
Go and tell Kate that
we're going out sailing tomorrow.

1507
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:33,230
- Right.
- Yeah.

1508
01:35:33,313 --> 01:35:35,233
- Okay.
- Come on.

1509
01:35:37,572 --> 01:35:42,206
Kate, I've got
something to tell you.

1510
01:35:42,289 --> 01:35:44,461
We're going sailing tomorrow.

1511
01:35:44,544 --> 01:35:47,843
Yeah, just the two of us.
Ian's gonna take me out on the boat.

1512
01:36:21,703 --> 01:36:23,622
So, did Terry tell you the good news?

1513
01:36:23,707 --> 01:36:26,378
Yeah, it's a wonderful idea.

1514
01:36:26,421 --> 01:36:30,345
'Cause you two never really got the chance
to spend much time on your boat, did you?

1515
01:36:30,428 --> 01:36:33,307
- And you were so excited when you first bought it.
- Yeah.

1516
01:36:33,392 --> 01:36:35,603
I told Ian about Angela taking you
shopping tomorrow as well.

1517
01:36:35,688 --> 01:36:38,109
Oh, yeah. She's so nice.

1518
01:36:42,577 --> 01:36:45,959
Mike Eisley from the garden party
asked if we were serious.

1519
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:50,049
And then he invited me to
Morocco for the weekend.

1520
01:36:50,086 --> 01:36:51,678
And what did you say?

1521
01:36:51,763 --> 01:36:54,726
Well, I told him that I loved you.

1522
01:36:54,810 --> 01:36:59,151
For the first time in my life,
those words actually had meaning.

1523
01:36:59,235 --> 01:37:01,281
I love you.

1524
01:37:02,658 --> 01:37:04,622
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1525
01:37:04,662 --> 01:37:09,339
- You seem a bit distracted.
- No, I'm just thinking about what you're saying.

1526
01:37:09,464 --> 01:37:11,635
And I'm tired, you know.

1527
01:37:11,677 --> 01:37:14,808
Well, you have been
working really hard recently.

1528
01:37:16,019 --> 01:37:18,023
I think taking your boat
out with your brother...

1529
01:37:18,107 --> 01:37:21,363
will do you just
as much good as him.

1530
01:37:21,446 --> 01:37:24,829
- Is he all right?
- He's depressed.

1531
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:28,794
He drinks too much
and he's getting sullen, and-

1532
01:37:28,837 --> 01:37:30,924
Kate's worried that
he might hurt himself.

1533
01:37:31,007 --> 01:37:33,513
Well, maybe he-
Well, he should go to a doctor then.

1534
01:37:33,549 --> 01:37:36,059
No, he resists. He resists.

1535
01:37:36,144 --> 01:37:40,318
I didn't tell Kate this,
but he's talked of suicide.

1536
01:37:40,359 --> 01:37:42,906
Oh, my God.

1537
01:37:45,161 --> 01:37:47,749
- I'm so sorry. That's awful.
- I know.

1538
01:39:39,639 --> 01:39:42,395
Best thing we ever did,
getting this boat, Terry, isn't it?

1539
01:39:42,478 --> 01:39:44,649
Eh?

1540
01:39:44,733 --> 01:39:47,864
Kate's right. We don't get out on it
as often as we should.

1541
01:39:47,906 --> 01:39:49,867
It's sad how things
turned out, isn't it?

1542
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:53,625
- Don't start, Terry.
- No, I mean it, Ian.

1543
01:39:53,668 --> 01:39:55,629
We made the wrong decision.

1544
01:39:55,671 --> 01:39:58,260
The way I see it,
we didn't have much choice.

1545
01:39:58,344 --> 01:40:00,807
You always have choice, Ian.

1546
01:40:00,849 --> 01:40:03,646
I see that now.

1547
01:40:03,771 --> 01:40:05,650
I mean, I- I didn't at first.

1548
01:40:05,734 --> 01:40:10,327
I thought... like you,
that we had no choice, but-

1549
01:40:10,409 --> 01:40:12,957
All right, let's say that you're right-
which I'm not saying-

1550
01:40:12,998 --> 01:40:14,960
but let's say for
the sake of argument...

1551
01:40:15,002 --> 01:40:18,384
- that we did make the wrong choice.
- For the sake of argument?

1552
01:40:19,678 --> 01:40:21,641
You really fool yourself,
Ian, don't you?

1553
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:25,189
His testimony was gonna put Uncle Howard
in prison for the rest of his life.

1554
01:40:25,271 --> 01:40:27,193
Well, maybe Uncle Howard
deserves to go to jail.

1555
01:40:27,275 --> 01:40:30,783
Oh, what a thing to say.
Forget it.

1556
01:40:30,867 --> 01:40:36,544
Christ, you think we've committed
some kind of unnatural act, but we haven't.

1557
01:40:36,628 --> 01:40:39,634
The whole of human life
is about violence.

1558
01:40:39,717 --> 01:40:42,390
It's a cruel world, Terry.

1559
01:40:42,473 --> 01:40:44,560
You're just shaken up
because you've come-

1560
01:40:44,644 --> 01:40:47,942
you've come face-to-face
with your own human nature.

1561
01:40:50,572 --> 01:40:54,497
I- I mean,
I didn't have to do it.

1562
01:40:54,539 --> 01:40:57,086
Well, why did you then?

1563
01:40:57,128 --> 01:41:02,639
I just kept going, like- like when
I gamble over my head, you know?

1564
01:41:02,722 --> 01:41:05,102
I just put the bet down
like when I'm in a dream.

1565
01:41:05,185 --> 01:41:07,316
You weren't dreaming
when you shot him.

1566
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:11,574
All right. Look, listen.

1567
01:41:11,656 --> 01:41:14,162
We made a mistake, right? But it's over.

1568
01:41:14,246 --> 01:41:16,876
All right? We made the wrong choice.
I'm giving you that...

1569
01:41:16,959 --> 01:41:20,215
but being punished
by it won't undo it.

1570
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:23,306
Martin Burns is dead.
He's dead.

1571
01:41:34,453 --> 01:41:36,415
I called the police last night.

1572
01:41:37,876 --> 01:41:40,339
You did what?

1573
01:41:40,421 --> 01:41:44,598
I called them and I told them I had
information on the murder of Martin Burns.

1574
01:41:44,681 --> 01:41:46,601
They said,
"Who is it?"

1575
01:41:46,685 --> 01:41:51,946
I wanted to tell them...
who I was, but I didn't.

1576
01:41:52,988 --> 01:41:55,202
Hung up.

1577
01:41:55,285 --> 01:41:57,915
I'm gonna call them
as soon as I get back, Ian.

1578
01:41:57,999 --> 01:42:00,546
Why would you do that?

1579
01:42:00,671 --> 01:42:05,055
What's the matter with you?
It's suicide, Terry.

1580
01:42:05,138 --> 01:42:09,272
Don't you even care that you're gonna take
Uncle Howard and me with you?

1581
01:42:09,355 --> 01:42:12,779
It's the order of things,
Ian. It's off kilter. Can't you see it?

1582
01:42:13,865 --> 01:42:16,453
I have to straighten it out.

1583
01:42:16,537 --> 01:42:21,379
All right. I don't wanna
talk about this anymore.

1584
01:42:21,463 --> 01:42:24,635
We came out here just to relax, didn't we?
Just to sail and unwind, eh?

1585
01:42:24,678 --> 01:42:27,433
Yeah.

1586
01:42:27,476 --> 01:42:30,815
- I'm gonna get us some more beers, all right?
- All right.

1587
01:43:52,896 --> 01:43:55,527
Why couldn't you just let it
go? Why couldn't you let it go?

1588
01:43:55,563 --> 01:43:56,237
Ian, what's wrong?

1589
01:43:56,319 --> 01:43:58,323
- You've ruined everything, Terry.
- Ian, what's wrong?

1590
01:43:58,366 --> 01:44:01,038
Terry, you've ruined it!
You've ruined everything!

1591
01:44:01,121 --> 01:44:04,628
- Ian, stop!
- We could've had everything!

1592
01:44:08,803 --> 01:44:11,015
Ian. Ian.

1593
01:44:12,058 --> 01:44:14,187
Ian. Ian.

1594
01:44:15,190 --> 01:44:17,862
Ian.

1595
01:44:20,075 --> 01:44:22,037
Ian!

1596
01:44:23,081 --> 01:44:25,294
Oh, God.

1597
01:44:30,638 --> 01:44:32,600
God.

1598
01:44:39,405 --> 01:44:42,203
What we think happened,
but we don't know for sure...

1599
01:44:42,244 --> 01:44:45,334
one killed the other,
either on purpose or by accident...

1600
01:44:45,417 --> 01:44:49,342
and then took his own life,
drowned himself.

1601
01:44:49,426 --> 01:44:51,722
Awful.

1602
01:44:51,764 --> 01:44:54,685
The place reeks of booze and pills.

1603
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:57,817
I don't know.
Every day, it's something else.

1604
01:45:04,289 --> 01:45:07,462
Oh, I like that.

1605
01:45:07,545 --> 01:45:09,466
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

1606
01:45:09,549 --> 01:45:11,470
- I would look good in that.
- Yeah, Terry would love that.

1607
01:45:11,512 --> 01:45:14,017
- Would he?
- Yeah, men love that sort of shape.

1608
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:17,190
I wore something similar
when Ian first saw me.
