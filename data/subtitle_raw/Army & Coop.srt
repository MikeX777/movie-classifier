1
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:40,770
Welcome back, I'm Mike Haynes,

2
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:41,829
along with Peter McNabb.

3
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,611
And Peter, Colorado had
this game wrapped up

4
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,965
until Mike Armstrong took
that spearing penalty

5
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:48,343
late in the third period.

6
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:49,177
You're right, Mike.

7
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:51,097
It's just undisciplined hockey.

8
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:53,169
Armstrong cost Colorado that game.

9
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,692
Wait, there's something happening

10
00:00:54,693 --> 00:00:56,460
on the Colorado bench.

11
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:59,312
It looks like a fight,
but is that Armstrong?

12
00:00:59,313 --> 00:01:01,547
Oh, he's got
Coach Palmer by the necktie!

13
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:03,084
Armstrong's feeding him rights.

14
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:04,564
Palmer's getting pummeled.

15
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,897
He's a bloody mess.

16
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,014
Oh, an uppercut!

17
00:01:07,015 --> 00:01:08,471
I think Palmer's out cold.

18
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:10,175
Somebody'd better get in there, Peter.

19
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:12,305
Finally security jumps in.

20
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,578
Whoa! Now Armstrong's going
after security guards.

21
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:15,845
Everybody's jumping in.

22
00:01:15,846 --> 00:01:17,186
I've never seen anything like it.

23
00:01:17,187 --> 00:01:19,588
We've got chaos in Colorado.

24
00:02:15,581 --> 00:02:19,567
Hey, big boy. I'm
ready for that flunking.

25
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:23,235
You filthy animal.

26
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:03,374
Hey, boys.

27
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,942
What? Pussy got no face, boys.

28
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:20,792
Here you go, Coop.

29
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:15,476
Hey, Bill, you got hands like feet.

30
00:05:15,477 --> 00:05:20,120
Hey, you call that a shot?
I piss harder than that.

31
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,658
- Fuck!
- Fuck you!

32
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:24,897
Hey, Bill, I got a handy
from your sister last night.

33
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:29,135
Yeah, I found her off
farmersonly.com.

34
00:05:29,136 --> 00:05:30,386
Fucking bender.

35
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:34,683
Heard you're still suspended.

36
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:35,733
Yeah.

37
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:37,869
You really fucked that coach up.

38
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:38,870
Yeah.

39
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,537
Whoa! She's walking like
she had bad anal last night.

40
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:46,284
Is there bad anal?

41
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:47,285
Right?

42
00:05:47,957 --> 00:05:49,290
Here comes Bill.

43
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:52,965
- Game, Bill.
- Game, Army.

44
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,049
Tell Barb I said hello.

45
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,239
Stop! Stop!

46
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,424
Stop!

47
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:09,625
Stop!

48
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:10,694
Stop!

49
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:11,863
Stop!

50
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:13,120
Whoa.

51
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:14,012
What do you want?

52
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:15,059
What's going on here?

53
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,143
Well, what's it to you, shit stain?

54
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,231
What?

55
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:23,749
I said, what's it two you, shit stain?

56
00:06:26,547 --> 00:06:29,714
I think you owe this kid an apology.

57
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
Sorry.

58
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,448
Get your inbred ass outta here.

59
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:37,931
Thanks, mister.

60
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:42,349
No problem. I don't think
he'll bother you anymore.

61
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:45,661
Is that an Oshie shirt?

62
00:06:45,662 --> 00:06:47,251
Yeah.

63
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:51,147
Nice. Played juniors
with him in Sioux Falls.

64
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:52,524
Really?

65
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:54,256
Yeah. Good guy.

66
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:55,884
Wait.

67
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:58,037
You are Mike Armstrong.

68
00:06:58,038 --> 00:06:59,603
Yeah. What's your name?

69
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:03,747
Charlie. My brother says
you're just a washed-up grinder.

70
00:07:03,748 --> 00:07:05,218
Well, you can tell your brother to go-

71
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:07,996
- My dad says you're the
toughest guy in the league.

72
00:07:07,997 --> 00:07:09,080
Well, yeah.

73
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:13,338
What happened?

74
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:14,762
I,

75
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:15,930
I hurt my leg.

76
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,404
Whoa.

77
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,655
Excuse me, kid.

78
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:22,546
Hey, hey.

79
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:29,809
Well,

80
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:32,949
you win some, you lose some.

81
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,033
I guess so.

82
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:38,214
Whoa, you're a girl.

83
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:40,908
Yeah.

84
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,695
Well, I just thought that...

85
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:44,180
Ah, me never mind.

86
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:45,709
You headed her back to the rink?

87
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,765
Yeah.

88
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,403
Well, I'll give you a ride.

89
00:07:49,404 --> 00:07:50,404
Pop those breaks.

90
00:07:56,165 --> 00:07:58,332
Well, see you later, Coop.

91
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:01,481
You'll be a good boy?

92
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,293
And don't shit on my bed again, okay?

93
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:21,335
- Armstrong!
- Shit!

94
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:23,650
Wait a minute,
you son of a bitch.

95
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:25,171
Mr. Fleming.

96
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,100
You owe me rent, dickhead.

97
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:29,394
Yeah, I know.

98
00:08:29,395 --> 00:08:31,376
So when are you gonna pay?

99
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,833
The other guys pay.

100
00:08:32,834 --> 00:08:36,251
Their parents pay, on time, every time.

101
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:38,487
Just, just gimme a few days.

102
00:08:38,488 --> 00:08:39,657
Tell me, what are you doing hanging out

103
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:42,408
with these 20-year-old
college kids, Armstrong?

104
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,032
I mean you gotta be pushing, what, 40?

105
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:48,573
You're a complete fuckup.
You know that, right?

106
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:50,480
Nice. Is that Kirkland?

107
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:51,481
Yeah.

108
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:56,343
Hey, Coop, get back here!

109
00:08:56,344 --> 00:08:59,451
You got till the end
of the week, Armstrong.

110
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:03,535
I'll get your fucking
rent. Just gimme a break.

111
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,810
Fuck!

112
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:15,061
Here, Cooper! Come here, bud!

113
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:23,842
Fuck me.

114
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:39,739
Oh shit.

115
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:52,904
Gabe?

116
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:55,934
How are you this fine afternoon?

117
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:57,604
Pretty shitty, actually.

118
00:09:57,605 --> 00:10:01,226
I take it you
overindulged once again.

119
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:03,472
No, I was overserved.

120
00:10:03,473 --> 00:10:06,282
Of course you were.

121
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:09,450
Got you some doughnut holes, coffee.

122
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,019
Ah fuck. I forgot my keys in the car.

123
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,815
Your generosity is only surpassed

124
00:10:18,816 --> 00:10:21,233
by your oratorical eloquence.

125
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:26,840
Hey, check this out.
Found it in my locker.

126
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:28,091
My rookie card.

127
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:34,233
Well. Such a
fine-looking young man.

128
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:37,062
May I inquire as to when

129
00:10:37,063 --> 00:10:40,444
this delightful photograph was created?

130
00:10:40,445 --> 00:10:44,122
Geez, that's gotta be 17, 18 years ago.

131
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:46,173
You haven't
changed a bit, Michael.

132
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:49,880
And you need glasses,
Gabe. You seen bossman?

133
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:51,202
Indeed.

134
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:53,535
Mr. Jones is anxiously awaiting

135
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:56,703
your arrival inside the establishment.

136
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:04,262
You're looking dapper
this morning, Mr. Jones.

137
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:07,156
Army! Where the fuck have you been?

138
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:09,074
Get this cooler loaded.

139
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,259
You gonna get that?

140
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,593
If you're not.

141
00:11:47,145 --> 00:11:48,604
We open at noon.

142
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:49,938
It's 10 after.

143
00:11:56,937 --> 00:11:59,020
Where are the facilities?

144
00:12:16,738 --> 00:12:19,759
It's colder than a well
digger's ass in here.

145
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,341
You know, I asked you
to be here on the time.

146
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,889
I've got a meeting tomorrow.

147
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,278
Yeah, I know, but what happened-

148
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,843
- But nothing.

149
00:12:27,844 --> 00:12:29,608
You know, if you didn't
draw people into here,

150
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:32,692
I would've fired you a long time ago.

151
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:37,111
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, Jenny.

152
00:12:37,112 --> 00:12:41,362
Thanks for filling in. It's
hard to find good help.

153
00:12:55,197 --> 00:12:56,447
Hello, Jenny.

154
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:02,977
You know, that's the third time

155
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:04,797
this week you've been late.

156
00:13:04,798 --> 00:13:07,039
How am I supposed to run
a business like this?

157
00:13:12,802 --> 00:13:14,487
You know, that's it.

158
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:16,852
One more fuckup and you're outta here.

159
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:19,353
You got that? One more fuckup.

160
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,796
Yes, master. I can do better, master.

161
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:25,004
Don't whip me, master. I can do better.

162
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,647
And stay away from my daughter.

163
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:28,462
She doesn't want anything to do with you.

164
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:31,379
Yes, master. I'll stay away
from your daughter, master.

165
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,630
I'll stay away.

166
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:05,344
What's up, shit stabber?

167
00:14:08,343 --> 00:14:09,775
Son of a...

168
00:14:09,776 --> 00:14:11,693
Jen, we need to talk.

169
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,294
Come on, you can't be
serious about this guy.

170
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,657
That is none of your business.

171
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,325
Cut me some slack.

172
00:14:22,435 --> 00:14:24,969
Cut you some slack? Are you kidding me?

173
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,195
Ha, not again.

174
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:30,779
You're right, not again,
'cause I don't care anymore.

175
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:33,771
Fuck.

176
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,247
Can I get a Tom Collins?

177
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:44,762
Yeah. You want a tampon with that?

178
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,647
Okay. How about a ginger ale?

179
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:57,171
I'll take a water. No ice, please.

180
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:03,207
My name's...

181
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,220
Jen, be reasonable. He's
not the guy you think he is.

182
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:07,262
Just out of my way.

183
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,901
I'm telling you, he's a player.

184
00:15:08,902 --> 00:15:10,232
I've seen him at the clubs.

185
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:13,016
He makes me look like Boy George
with erectile dysfunction.

186
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:17,695
Whatever! He is a better
man than you'll ever be.

187
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:19,087
Me? Are you kidding me?

188
00:15:19,088 --> 00:15:21,088
Just drop it, Michael!

189
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,689
Who pissed in her Wheaties?

190
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:29,355
Son of a...

191
00:15:29,356 --> 00:15:31,023
Murray, come here.

192
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,983
I need favor.

193
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:33,824
What?

194
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,914
Go over to my house, find
Coop. He got out again.

195
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:38,800
Man, I got shit to do today.

196
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:42,148
You're a fucking dishwasher,
and a shitty one at that.

197
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,259
Look, clean it up and go.

198
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Wait.

199
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,763
I can't.

200
00:15:47,764 --> 00:15:49,043
Why not?

201
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:51,169
I don't have a car.

202
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:53,559
Just take, take mine.
The keys are in it.

203
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,921
And here. Fill her up.

204
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,172
Be careful. It's a classic.

205
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:02,753
But I don't know how to drive.

206
00:16:23,552 --> 00:16:24,552
Army!

207
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:31,302
You seen the bartender? Ugly guy?

208
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:33,423
He's in the back.

209
00:16:33,424 --> 00:16:35,924
Army, get your ass out here!

210
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:38,624
Hey, Bobby, what's up?

211
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:42,065
Don't give me that shit.
Answer your goddamn phone.

212
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:43,444
I left it at home.

213
00:16:48,564 --> 00:16:53,314
Well, would you look at that?

214
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:02,185
Son of a...

215
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:49,438
Read this. Got faxed to me
by the league this morning.

216
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:50,746
Yeah.

217
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:54,426
You've been suspended for 200 games.

218
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:57,392
Two fucking hundred.

219
00:17:57,393 --> 00:17:58,393
200? Why?

220
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:02,263
Well, let's think about this.

221
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:06,744
You're the first guy to get
into a fight on your own bench

222
00:18:06,745 --> 00:18:10,793
with your own coach on
national television.

223
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:12,855
He's a fucking asshole, and you know it.

224
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:15,096
You know what, he's a fucking
asshole with a broken jaw.

225
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:17,441
You're lucky he doesn't sue you.

226
00:18:17,442 --> 00:18:19,485
Yeah, but 200 games?

227
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:23,880
Look, you took a shit on
the hood of the owner's car.

228
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:26,825
And you put Viagra in the
visitors' water bottle.

229
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:29,686
You fucked the CEO's daughter

230
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:32,669
Hey, it was his granddaughter.

231
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,533
Hey, are you listening to me?

232
00:18:35,534 --> 00:18:37,201
What's your point?

233
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,698
That's a termination letter.

234
00:18:42,699 --> 00:18:44,338
I'm terminating our agreement.

235
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:45,415
What?

236
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,941
Look, Colorado, they're gonna cut you,

237
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:49,940
and nobody's gonna wanna
pick up your contract.

238
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:50,861
All right? You're done.

239
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:51,970
Well, I heard Dallas-

240
00:18:51,971 --> 00:18:53,138
- No, stop it.

241
00:18:54,671 --> 00:18:57,254
I cannot be your agent anymore.

242
00:18:58,101 --> 00:18:59,851
You're damaged goods.

243
00:19:01,658 --> 00:19:04,927
You've been my agent since I was 19.

244
00:19:04,928 --> 00:19:05,928
Army.

245
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,863
Think of this as a wake-up call.

246
00:19:10,864 --> 00:19:12,654
Get your shit together.

247
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:13,971
My shit?

248
00:19:13,972 --> 00:19:16,952
Yeah. I mean, look at you.

249
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:20,782
You're outta shape, you're immature,

250
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:22,503
and you're a goddamn drunk.

251
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:24,022
Look out, I got a baby on deck,

252
00:19:24,023 --> 00:19:26,606
and I think it's coming breach.

253
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,210
Ew!

254
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:37,215
Come on!

255
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Ah!

256
00:19:55,873 --> 00:19:59,410
You're unreliable and you're homophobic.

257
00:19:59,411 --> 00:20:03,578
You smell like dog food.

258
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:29,793
Look, life's not all coke and pussy, Army.

259
00:20:32,489 --> 00:20:33,684
I gotta move on.
Hey, thanks for telling me

260
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:35,435
I had a dick on my...

261
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,919
I see things have changed.

262
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:44,155
Hey, Jen.

263
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:46,050
Oh, hey, Scott.

264
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:52,773
How is your day
progressing, Michael?

265
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:55,941
Was Mr. Jones upset by your tardiness?

266
00:20:58,353 --> 00:21:01,454
Yeah, but that's the
least of my problems.

267
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:03,646
Do tell.

268
00:21:03,647 --> 00:21:07,964
Well, Coop's loose again,
Jen won't talk to me,

269
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:10,898
and my agent dropped me like
a fucking T-Mobile call.

270
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:14,895
A most eventful day
thus far, wouldn't you say?

271
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:16,229
Yeah, I guess.

272
00:21:18,988 --> 00:21:20,546
I shouldn't be here anyway, man.

273
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:23,089
I'm a hockey player, not a bartender.

274
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,348
Ice hockey is
a young man's endeavor.

275
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:28,099
You, my aging friend,

276
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,259
are well into the twilight of your career.

277
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,549
Sooner or later you must find
a less taxing profession.

278
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,659
Things just used to be easier, though.

279
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,893
I mean, I'd get up, play hockey, party,

280
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:46,252
go to the next town, get
up, play hockey, party.

281
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,644
Things just got complicated.

282
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:50,758
Indeed they do, Michael.

283
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:54,018
The knowledge and experience
one gathers over time

284
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:58,418
typically prepares them
for a mature adulthood.

285
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:00,308
Well, not me brother.

286
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:04,044
I'm as free as the luggage
on Southwest. Life's good.

287
00:22:04,045 --> 00:22:07,377
Your day indicates
otherwise, Michael.

288
00:22:07,378 --> 00:22:10,346
But I respect your fortitude.

289
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:11,847
Onward, young man.

290
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:14,158
Thanks, Gabe.

291
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,154
Our talks always, uh,
make me feel better, man.

292
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:23,155
Most enriching persiflage,
Michael. Most enriching.

293
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:26,167
Thank you for using the ashtray.

294
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:39,219
That one's on me.

295
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:44,644
Who's that asshole?

296
00:22:47,745 --> 00:22:49,504
I don't know.

297
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:52,007
What happened to you last night, bud.

298
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:55,208
Last I saw you were doing
a line off that GILF's ass.

299
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:56,590
GILF?

300
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:57,591
Grandma.

301
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:01,974
Took her back to the stabbin' cabin.

302
00:23:01,975 --> 00:23:04,725
Got some strange. Shit got weird.

303
00:23:05,767 --> 00:23:08,040
That's definitely PT, bud.

304
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:09,491
PT?

305
00:23:09,492 --> 00:23:11,378
Past talent.

306
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:14,489
Now, what is it with
you and redheads, bud?

307
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,910
That chick was older than my granny.

308
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:18,339
Pussy's pussy, my friend.

309
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,173
Eh.

310
00:23:19,174 --> 00:23:20,395
I don't mean to eavesdrop,

311
00:23:20,396 --> 00:23:22,153
but I have to disagree with you.

312
00:23:22,154 --> 00:23:23,394
Army, is it?

313
00:23:23,395 --> 00:23:24,606
Yeah.

314
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:28,365
I've been married for over
25 years. I love my wife.

315
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:31,723
I view her as much more
than a sexual object.

316
00:23:31,724 --> 00:23:32,915
There's an intellectual connection

317
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,637
that every healthy couple enjoys.

318
00:23:34,638 --> 00:23:36,752
Thanks, Dr. Phil. You
gonna send me to Malibu now?

319
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,101
It's that intellectual connection

320
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:42,318
that's kept me loyal all these years.

321
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,696
I spent a lotta time on the road,

322
00:23:43,697 --> 00:23:46,305
and believe me, I had chances.

323
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:48,512
I bet you've had a lot
of opportunities, huh?

324
00:23:48,513 --> 00:23:51,008
What do you do, bud?

325
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:53,522
I'm, uh, I'm in sales.

326
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:57,300
Really? I'm an out-of-work gynecologist.

327
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:59,022
- Really?
- Yeah.

328
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:01,940
Just looking for the right opening.

329
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,950
About freaking time.

330
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:09,223
Hey, come here. I wanna
talk to you real quick.

331
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:10,750
Let go of me.

332
00:24:10,751 --> 00:24:12,340
Stop! Get off of me!
Hey, just relax.

333
00:24:12,341 --> 00:24:13,268
- What the fuck?
- Stop!

334
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:15,129
Get your hands off of me! Stop it.

335
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,306
I take it you're a friend of his?

336
00:24:17,307 --> 00:24:18,394
Best friends.

337
00:24:18,395 --> 00:24:21,145
Hey, what's up there, little guy?

338
00:24:22,136 --> 00:24:23,219
Little guy?

339
00:24:27,827 --> 00:24:29,483
Fuck you.

340
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:30,588
- Fuck me?
- Yeah.

341
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:31,642
Do you know who you're talking to?

342
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:34,013
Yeah, I know who I'm
talking to, Dickstrong.

343
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,192
Fucking washed-up, Pillsbury
Dough-looking motherfucker

344
00:24:36,193 --> 00:24:37,574
that can't play anymore.

345
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:39,774
That's why you're riding pine, right?

346
00:24:39,775 --> 00:24:40,770
Yeah, I've seen you play.

347
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,329
You think you're a tough guy,

348
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,911
wearing a helmet and your little gloves?

349
00:24:45,912 --> 00:24:48,329
You're just a big, fat pussy.

350
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,385
All right.

351
00:24:53,386 --> 00:24:56,127
Knock it off, otherwise I'll take you out.

352
00:24:56,128 --> 00:24:59,204
You? Take me out where, on a date?

353
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:01,909
We're going on a date, you and me?

354
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,725
I don't think so.

355
00:25:03,726 --> 00:25:05,476
You fucking has-been.

356
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:13,664
Fuck! Fuck!

357
00:25:15,344 --> 00:25:16,344
Fuck!

358
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:22,333
Go to sleep, Frodo.

359
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:39,839
Where'd that guy go?

360
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,217
Doctor's appointment.

361
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:44,218
Really?

362
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,441
Yeah.

363
00:26:01,475 --> 00:26:02,994
Could you believe that asshole?

364
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:04,150
Mm-hmm.

365
00:26:04,151 --> 00:26:05,151
Eh, shit.

366
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,561
Beer?

367
00:26:19,562 --> 00:26:21,755
I'm, I'm pregnant.

368
00:26:21,756 --> 00:26:24,783
Oh, right, right, yeah. Tequila?

369
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,643
Could I just have water, please?

370
00:26:26,644 --> 00:26:27,644
Sure.

371
00:26:34,046 --> 00:26:36,344
How old do you think she is?

372
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,428
Eh, 16, 17.

373
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:40,921
Definitely FT.

374
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:41,922
FT?

375
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,023
Let me guess. Future talent?

376
00:26:46,045 --> 00:26:48,947
This guy gets it.

377
00:26:48,948 --> 00:26:51,197
Well, that's way too
young to be a mother.

378
00:26:51,198 --> 00:26:54,217
Are you kidding me?
She's a total smoke show.

379
00:26:54,218 --> 00:26:57,317
I mean, safe as they come,
too. She's already pregnant.

380
00:26:57,318 --> 00:27:00,643
There's no way she's 18, bud.

381
00:27:00,644 --> 00:27:02,600
That's a guideline, not a rule.

382
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:04,534
Uh, actually, it's a law.

383
00:27:05,393 --> 00:27:07,648
Well, you know what I always say.

384
00:27:07,649 --> 00:27:09,979
Before you attack her, wrap your whacker.

385
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,244
Cover your stump before you hump.

386
00:27:12,245 --> 00:27:15,415
Sheath that knife. She ain't your wife.

387
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,751
Cover your diddle before
you fiddle that middle.

388
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:20,835
Don't be silly. Protect your willy.

389
00:27:22,032 --> 00:27:23,311
- Huh?
- Oh!

390
00:27:23,312 --> 00:27:26,062
I'm beginning to like this guy.

391
00:27:28,929 --> 00:27:29,929
10 bucks.

392
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,920
Just kidding.

393
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:35,576
Water's only three bucks.

394
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:36,577
Oh.

395
00:27:38,598 --> 00:27:41,931
Jesus, water's free. This ain't Flint.

396
00:27:54,428 --> 00:27:55,428
Ah, fuck.

397
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:04,948
Dick.

398
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:07,248
It's Rich, asshole.

399
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:08,698
I think the gay bar's up the road.

400
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:10,625
If I were gay, I wouldn't be humping Jen

401
00:28:10,626 --> 00:28:12,258
twice a day, now would I?

402
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:13,333
I've been meaning to ask you,

403
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:15,773
how do you like my sloppy seconds?

404
00:28:15,774 --> 00:28:17,285
Hey, Richie.

405
00:28:17,286 --> 00:28:18,619
Hey, precious.

406
00:28:21,196 --> 00:28:22,418
I'll get you a drink while you set up.

407
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:23,639
Okay, pumpkin.

408
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,640
Oh my God.

409
00:28:26,612 --> 00:28:28,744
You're jealous, Armstrong.

410
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:31,313
Jealous of you? I don't think so.

411
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:34,485
Ah, Rogaine doesn't seem
to be kicking in, does it?

412
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:36,602
Listen here, Army.

413
00:28:36,603 --> 00:28:38,382
You do us all a favor
and stay away from Jen.

414
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,713
She doesn't want anything to do with you.

415
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:42,297
All righty, then.

416
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:48,146
Soon, I'll get her outta this
place, away from your shit.

417
00:28:48,147 --> 00:28:51,170
Okay, Dick. Nobody's
buying this good guy routine.

418
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:52,519
I know what kind of fuck monkey you are,

419
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,179
and soon, so will Jen.

420
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,232
Yes. Sorry, buddy.

421
00:28:56,233 --> 00:28:57,988
You lose. I win.

422
00:28:57,989 --> 00:28:59,572
Take it like a man.

423
00:29:01,852 --> 00:29:02,883
Geez, Dick.

424
00:29:02,884 --> 00:29:04,612
I'm gonna rip your head off
and piss down your throat.

425
00:29:04,613 --> 00:29:05,945
Hmm, you might wanna be careful

426
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:07,399
with that temper, Armstrong.

427
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,988
You might still be in the league.

428
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:11,813
Hey, let him go, buddy. Let him go.

429
00:29:11,814 --> 00:29:12,993
Yeah.

430
00:29:12,994 --> 00:29:16,096
Yeah, listen to your buddy, Gilligan.

431
00:29:16,097 --> 00:29:18,086
Is everything all right, guys?

432
00:29:18,087 --> 00:29:20,316
Everything's fine, honey.

433
00:29:20,317 --> 00:29:21,505
Okay.

434
00:29:42,077 --> 00:29:44,744
So I was in the islands in '79

435
00:29:46,355 --> 00:29:47,688
with Bob Marley.

436
00:29:49,002 --> 00:29:52,044
Dude reaches into his pocket,

437
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:53,878
pulls out a fatty jay.

438
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:58,090
We smoked that thing for, like, hours.

439
00:30:00,472 --> 00:30:01,972
I was really high,

440
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:04,394
but so clear.

441
00:30:05,827 --> 00:30:07,826
I pulled out a pen.

442
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:11,327
I wrote "One Love" in, like, five minutes.

443
00:30:12,358 --> 00:30:14,879
Marley pulls out his guitar,

444
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,880
and we're just jamming on the beach.

445
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:21,259
I was so baked.

446
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,958
I completely forgot about it.

447
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:30,876
I left the napkin with the
lyrics on Marley's coffee table.

448
00:30:32,228 --> 00:30:33,895
The rest is history.

449
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,836
Yeah. So, like, are
you gonna buy something?

450
00:30:39,837 --> 00:30:42,431
I need something strong.

451
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,934
- Strong?
- Really strong.

452
00:30:43,935 --> 00:30:45,268
Really strong?

453
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,631
How about the pre-rolled?

454
00:30:47,632 --> 00:30:49,769
It's gonna be a mix between Blue Kush

455
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,340
and Hawaiian Ballsack.

456
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:52,516
We call it Blue Balls,

457
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,526
other than the fact that it
doesn't leave you hanging.

458
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:55,515
And two hits of that,

459
00:30:55,516 --> 00:30:57,313
you're gonna be feeling
like Willie Nelson on 420,

460
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:59,476
if you know what I mean.

461
00:30:59,477 --> 00:31:01,972
I'll take six of these.

462
00:31:01,973 --> 00:31:03,140
Make it seven.

463
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:05,715
And, uh,

464
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:09,266
I'll take one of those,

465
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,600
a pack of those,

466
00:31:12,146 --> 00:31:14,049
an ounce of that,

467
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,475
a half ounce of that,

468
00:31:16,476 --> 00:31:19,186
the pipe that looks like a caterpillar,

469
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:21,437
the hermit crab over there.

470
00:31:23,837 --> 00:31:25,038
Aw!

471
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,961
That bong looks sick.

472
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:30,678
Yeah. That's the
Johnny Menzel Powertoke.

473
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:33,906
That's a good eye, my friend.

474
00:31:33,907 --> 00:31:35,157
I'll take it.

475
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:39,277
You have been most excellent, my man.

476
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,115
Throw in 10 bucks for yourself.

477
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:43,283
Thanks, man.

478
00:32:09,065 --> 00:32:10,533
Hey, where are you going?

479
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:11,909
I need a courtesy wipe.

480
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:14,283
Your toilet paper feels
more like sandpaper.

481
00:32:14,284 --> 00:32:16,078
Fuck that, I need your
help to prove to Jen

482
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,588
he's just another asshole.

483
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:19,730
Rich? No, he's okay.

484
00:32:19,731 --> 00:32:23,436
He's not okay, idiot.
He's just another douchebag.

485
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:24,270
I just found out he fucked

486
00:32:24,271 --> 00:32:26,115
like three of my teammates' wives.

487
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:27,033
Three!

488
00:32:27,034 --> 00:32:28,069
So?

489
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,002
So?

490
00:32:29,003 --> 00:32:30,460
So I need to prove to Jen that he's

491
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:32,831
a fucking shallow dickhead, just like me.

492
00:32:32,832 --> 00:32:34,074
It's my only hope.

493
00:32:34,075 --> 00:32:35,408
Hope? Of what?

494
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:37,724
Getting her back.

495
00:32:40,624 --> 00:32:41,707
Oh no, bud.

496
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,390
There's no hope of that.

497
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:50,891
Fuck.

498
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:02,859
Holy shit.

499
00:33:03,661 --> 00:33:05,262
Look at that redhead.

500
00:33:05,263 --> 00:33:08,336
She's got the ass of an eighth-grade boy.

501
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:09,989
I hate when you say that, bud.

502
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,775
Hey, ladies. How are we doing?

503
00:33:14,776 --> 00:33:16,548
Hey, can I get you guys
something to drink?

504
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:17,706
Pitcher of margaritas.

505
00:33:21,146 --> 00:33:23,979
Aw, girl! Last night being single.

506
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:28,345
One pitcher of margs.

507
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:31,017
Hey, that's perfect.

508
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:35,624
Get your jaw off the floor, loser.

509
00:33:37,124 --> 00:33:39,922
Oh, look at the bombs on that blonde.

510
00:33:39,923 --> 00:33:42,604
Yeah. Fucking racking.

511
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:44,172
Ah, shit.

512
00:33:48,857 --> 00:33:50,537
Where's that,
where is that bartender?

513
00:33:50,538 --> 00:33:52,035
- Yeah.
- Oh my gosh

514
00:33:52,036 --> 00:33:55,168
Hey, now, remember, no means yes then.

515
00:33:55,169 --> 00:33:58,813
Then yes means anal.
You think I'm stupid?

516
00:33:58,814 --> 00:34:01,162
Go get 'em, tiger.

517
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:04,163
Hey, ladies. Welcome to Mudrock's.

518
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:07,825
I'd like to take your picture. Yeah.

519
00:34:07,826 --> 00:34:12,340
I wanna show Santa what I
want for Christmas.

520
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,341
Uh.

521
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:17,422
Just kidding. Pitcher's on the house.

522
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:23,009
Hey, you see my friends over there?

523
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,116
They want your number so they know

524
00:34:24,117 --> 00:34:26,664
where they can find me in the morning.

525
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:29,456
Congratulations, by the way.

526
00:34:29,457 --> 00:34:30,692
Ow!

527
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,173
Oh!

528
00:34:32,174 --> 00:34:33,674
Oh yeah.

529
00:34:38,381 --> 00:34:40,839
Okay. Semen in you later.

530
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Smooth.

531
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:44,619
What did you say?

532
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,565
I just asked her if she wanted

533
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:47,214
to go halfsies on a bastard child.

534
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:49,915
And that didn't work?

535
00:34:49,916 --> 00:34:51,606
I don't know. They're losers.

536
00:34:53,555 --> 00:34:55,578
Sorry to interrupt you guys.

537
00:34:55,579 --> 00:34:56,912
What the hell?

538
00:35:11,217 --> 00:35:12,095
Oh yes.

539
00:35:12,095 --> 00:35:13,095
Too easy.

540
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,073
I'm gonna destroy that asshole.

541
00:35:28,074 --> 00:35:29,157
That's gay.

542
00:35:36,574 --> 00:35:38,513
Goddamn camel humpers.

543
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:40,973
Probably suicide bombers or something.

544
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:43,083
Well, that's not racist.

545
00:35:43,084 --> 00:35:44,334
I don't care.

546
00:35:44,335 --> 00:35:46,941
You know, they wipe their
ass with their left hand.

547
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:48,580
That's not exactly true.

548
00:35:48,581 --> 00:35:51,299
In reality, Scott, the
vast majority of Muslims

549
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,365
suffer more violence and
terrorism than non-Muslims.

550
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:57,238
In fact, over 90% of Muslims don't support

551
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,989
the extremist views of terrorism.

552
00:36:00,933 --> 00:36:02,134
Believe what you want.

553
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:05,230
My uncle served three tours in Iraq.

554
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:07,191
He saw it first hand.

555
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:29,102
This guy sucks.

556
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:33,686
He sounds like Nirvana and
Pearl Jam fucked a Muppet.

557
00:36:34,564 --> 00:36:36,397
Hey, he's really good.

558
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:38,876
Yeah.

559
00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:41,607
Everyone, make sure you
tip the hot bartender,

560
00:36:41,608 --> 00:36:43,841
who this next song goes out to.

561
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:47,342
And it's not that fat fuck behind the bar.

562
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:49,541
It's Jen.

563
00:36:51,218 --> 00:36:52,635
I love you, baby.

564
00:37:47,816 --> 00:37:49,719
I'm gonna take a short break.

565
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,543
Yeah!

566
00:37:53,544 --> 00:37:54,961
You suck!

567
00:37:56,976 --> 00:37:59,393
Hey, can we get some beers?

568
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:02,606
You guys carrying?

569
00:38:02,607 --> 00:38:04,025
Carrying what?

570
00:38:04,026 --> 00:38:05,456
Guns, bombs.

571
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:08,322
Dude, I'm from Cleveland.
He's from Seattle.

572
00:38:08,323 --> 00:38:10,358
We're Air Force cadets from the Springs.

573
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:12,380
Yeah, and I'm Caitlyn Jenner.

574
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,775
What can I get you guys?

575
00:38:17,776 --> 00:38:18,776
Two Hazed.

576
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:27,122
I was on the tail of a KGB agent

577
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:30,458
in Birmingham,

578
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:31,459
the UK.

579
00:38:32,858 --> 00:38:34,941
I was in an Aston Martin.

580
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:38,230
Great cars, by the way.

581
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:42,163
I highly recommend one,
if you have the means.

582
00:38:42,164 --> 00:38:44,992
And suddenly, a helicopter lowered

583
00:38:44,993 --> 00:38:48,383
these two ninjas into my backseat.

584
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:52,041
Excuse me.

585
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,700
Murray here.

586
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,628
Hey, Murray, where
the fuck are you, man?

587
00:38:57,629 --> 00:39:01,240
I'm on it, Army. I almost got him.

588
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:03,431
Where is he?

589
00:39:03,432 --> 00:39:06,017
I'll have him back in
the bar licking his nuts

590
00:39:06,018 --> 00:39:09,784
before you can say peanut butter Thursday.

591
00:39:09,785 --> 00:39:11,381
Bring Coop now!

592
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,299
Chill out. I'm on it.

593
00:39:19,888 --> 00:39:20,888
Where was I?

594
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:25,443
Oh yeah. These Russians in my backseat.

595
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:28,551
One of 'em was a chick.

596
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,407
Hot, like Maria Sharapova.

597
00:39:34,527 --> 00:39:38,681
Except, a real Russian, not from Florida.

598
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:42,682
Anyway, they've got guns
to the back of my head.

599
00:39:43,791 --> 00:39:45,880
Do you know what I do?

600
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:46,881
Do ya?

601
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:51,140
I drove that thing right off a cliff,

602
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:54,520
and I rolled out, doing like 60.

603
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:57,271
It flies off and burns in flames.

604
00:39:59,161 --> 00:40:02,880
And I'm just laying there, and suddenly,

605
00:40:02,881 --> 00:40:06,244
somebody comes up and kicks me in the leg.

606
00:40:06,245 --> 00:40:08,343
Do you know who it was?

607
00:40:08,344 --> 00:40:09,344
Do ya?

608
00:40:10,551 --> 00:40:11,551
Do ya?

609
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:21,383
King me.

610
00:40:34,275 --> 00:40:37,181
How's it hanging, sugar?

611
00:40:37,182 --> 00:40:40,202
A little to the left,
just below the knee.

612
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:42,120
Oh, you got it, baby.

613
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:46,021
Is, is that a man?

614
00:40:46,894 --> 00:40:48,227
Balls and all.

615
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,599
Um.

616
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Yeah.

617
00:40:57,908 --> 00:40:59,241
Well, the usual?

618
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:01,349
Oh, please

619
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:21,229
Well, see you later?

620
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,230
Yeah.

621
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:28,458
Damn.

622
00:41:31,964 --> 00:41:34,094
I need two Dells.

623
00:41:34,095 --> 00:41:35,512
Hey, Jen, wait.

624
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,729
I need to talk to you for a second.

625
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,980
What? I'm trying to work.

626
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:44,076
He's not the guy you think he is.

627
00:41:44,077 --> 00:41:45,077
Listen.

628
00:41:46,406 --> 00:41:47,906
He treats me well.

629
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:51,995
He holds the door open for me.

630
00:41:51,996 --> 00:41:53,496
He brings flowers.

631
00:41:55,536 --> 00:41:57,547
He's everything you're not.

632
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,387
I used to hold the door open for you.

633
00:41:59,388 --> 00:42:02,945
Yeah, sure, when you could stand.

634
00:42:02,946 --> 00:42:05,023
Half of the time, you
were passed out drunk.

635
00:42:05,024 --> 00:42:06,063
Come on.

636
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:07,731
Look, he loves me.

637
00:42:09,336 --> 00:42:11,912
Okay? We go on picnics together.

638
00:42:11,913 --> 00:42:13,853
We have doggie play dates.

639
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:16,181
Doggie play dates?

640
00:42:16,182 --> 00:42:17,849
Now I know he's gay.

641
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,112
Just drop it.

642
00:42:21,113 --> 00:42:22,432
Please.

643
00:42:22,433 --> 00:42:23,433
Jen.

644
00:42:24,252 --> 00:42:26,582
I didn't wanna tell you this,

645
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:30,911
but I saw him get that
girl's number over there.

646
00:42:30,912 --> 00:42:31,825
What girl?

647
00:42:31,826 --> 00:42:33,267
The one at the bachelorette party.

648
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:39,045
Hey, honey.

649
00:42:39,046 --> 00:42:41,617
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you with this,

650
00:42:41,618 --> 00:42:45,615
but he said you got a girl's
number from over there.

651
00:42:45,616 --> 00:42:47,085
A number?

652
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:49,169
Yeah. I saw you, joker.

653
00:42:50,324 --> 00:42:51,324
Oh, this?

654
00:42:53,664 --> 00:42:58,081
The bachelorette party wanted
me to play a few songs.

655
00:42:59,826 --> 00:43:02,659
That coulda happened to anybody.

656
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,260
Sorry, honey.

657
00:43:15,531 --> 00:43:16,531
Fuck.

658
00:43:22,212 --> 00:43:25,410
Michael, I sense
a level of frustration.

659
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:28,161
Is the day getting away from you?

660
00:43:30,468 --> 00:43:31,468
It's my...

661
00:43:32,982 --> 00:43:34,233
It's Jen.

662
00:43:34,234 --> 00:43:35,734
Hmm, yes?

663
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:40,307
She fucking hates me.

664
00:43:40,308 --> 00:43:42,890
When one door
closes, my good friend,

665
00:43:42,891 --> 00:43:45,082
another door opens.

666
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,946
We often look so long and so regretfully

667
00:43:47,947 --> 00:43:49,488
upon the closed door

668
00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:52,806
that we do not see the
ones which now stand open.

669
00:43:52,807 --> 00:43:57,807
All my doors are closing.
My career, my girl, my life.

670
00:43:58,182 --> 00:44:02,166
Michael, your
mind is a powerful thing.

671
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:04,326
When you fill it with positive thoughts,

672
00:44:04,327 --> 00:44:07,405
your life will follow suit.

673
00:44:07,406 --> 00:44:10,368
She's dating this complete a-hole.

674
00:44:10,369 --> 00:44:14,455
She thinks he's great, but
he's, he's no good for her.

675
00:44:14,456 --> 00:44:19,056
As the great poet Francois
de La Rochefoucauld once wrote,

676
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:23,796
"Absence diminishes small
loves and increases great ones,

677
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:28,529
as the wind blows out the
candle but lights the bonfire."

678
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:30,961
Yeah, I guess. Maybe.

679
00:44:30,962 --> 00:44:33,861
Look, I gotta get back to work.

680
00:44:33,862 --> 00:44:35,720
- So creepy.
- Can you believe it?

681
00:44:35,721 --> 00:44:37,756
She had red hair.
Look how cute this is.

682
00:44:37,757 --> 00:44:39,846
This is amazing.

683
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:42,317
- Oh, do that one.
- That one, for sure.

684
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:45,985
Oh my gosh.

685
00:44:51,295 --> 00:44:52,152
Hey, Army.

686
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:53,598
Hi, Charlie.

687
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,786
I wanted my mom to meet you.

688
00:44:55,787 --> 00:44:56,884
Oh, hi, Charlie's mom.

689
00:44:56,885 --> 00:44:58,824
It's Sally. Nice to meet you.

690
00:44:58,825 --> 00:45:00,545
Charlie can't stop talking about you.

691
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:01,706
Really?

692
00:45:01,707 --> 00:45:03,865
I was wondering if you'd sign my jersey.

693
00:45:03,866 --> 00:45:05,365
I thought you were an Oshie fan?

694
00:45:05,366 --> 00:45:06,533
Not anymore.

695
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,154
Hey.

696
00:45:26,635 --> 00:45:28,054
Hey.

697
00:45:28,055 --> 00:45:30,956
Is that your friend over there?

698
00:45:30,957 --> 00:45:32,076
Yeah.

699
00:45:32,077 --> 00:45:35,638
Why is he signing that
jersey for that little kid?

700
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:37,828
'Cause he's Mike Armstrong.

701
00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:39,614
The famous hockey player?

702
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:42,216
That's Mike Armstrong?

703
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:43,217
Yeah.

704
00:45:44,548 --> 00:45:49,121
Okay, can I go now? I got
a like a racist horse.

705
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:52,418
Thanks. Dad's not gonna believe it.

706
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:53,779
Hey, we got an open table back there,

707
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,616
if you guys would like to stay.

708
00:45:55,617 --> 00:45:56,815
We got great wings.

709
00:45:56,816 --> 00:45:58,467
Can we, Mom?

710
00:45:58,468 --> 00:45:59,635
Sure, honey.

711
00:46:07,417 --> 00:46:10,529
Hey, listen, as soon as
you get out of that chair,

712
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:12,061
why don't we get on the ice together?

713
00:46:12,062 --> 00:46:14,021
I could show you a few you things.

714
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:15,310
Yeah.

715
00:46:15,311 --> 00:46:17,228
Yeah, that sounds good.

716
00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:20,140
Can I talk to you in private?

717
00:46:20,141 --> 00:46:21,141
Sure.

718
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:27,373
I just wanted to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

719
00:46:27,374 --> 00:46:28,905
She gets picked on a lot and-

720
00:46:28,906 --> 00:46:31,035
- Don't mention it.

721
00:46:31,036 --> 00:46:32,971
It was nothing.

722
00:46:32,972 --> 00:46:35,528
Hey, Army, whose
dick do I have to suck

723
00:46:35,529 --> 00:46:37,556
to get a beer around here?

724
00:46:37,557 --> 00:46:39,504
You better get back to your customers.

725
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,506
We'll get something to eat.

726
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,507
All right.

727
00:46:50,087 --> 00:46:53,587
Can I have everyone's attention, please?

728
00:46:55,207 --> 00:46:56,790
Everyone, be quiet.

729
00:46:57,871 --> 00:47:02,204
That goes for you guys
playing foosball in the back.

730
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,112
Jen.

731
00:47:06,113 --> 00:47:07,113
Baby.

732
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:12,583
Can you, uh, come up to the stage, please?

733
00:47:18,188 --> 00:47:20,608
What the fuck?

734
00:47:20,609 --> 00:47:21,609
Jen, uh,

735
00:47:22,288 --> 00:47:25,705
we've been together for over a month now.

736
00:47:29,701 --> 00:47:31,034
What'll it be?

737
00:47:32,002 --> 00:47:35,638
I wanna spend the rest
of my life with you.

738
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:38,139
Uh, your best bourbon. Neat.

739
00:47:44,134 --> 00:47:47,884
Will you make me the
happiest man on Earth?

740
00:47:59,317 --> 00:48:00,817
Will you marry me?

741
00:48:02,637 --> 00:48:04,970
Are you kidding me?

742
00:48:08,657 --> 00:48:09,657
Yes.

743
00:48:16,358 --> 00:48:20,858
Hey, all right.

744
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,520
Another?

745
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:33,719
Rum and Coke.

746
00:48:41,035 --> 00:48:42,107
- Look at that.
- I'm so happy.

747
00:48:42,108 --> 00:48:43,264
Dang, look at
the size of that rock.

748
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:44,448
I know, it's great.

749
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:48,267
Yeah, no, actually,
I didn't pay for that.

750
00:48:48,268 --> 00:48:51,677
What the fuck is going on here?

751
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,095
I'll be out back.

752
00:48:55,886 --> 00:48:57,458
That was amazing.

753
00:48:57,459 --> 00:48:58,459
Yeah.

754
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:01,858
Army's having a tough time today, huh?

755
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:04,906
That might send him
over the edge, but...

756
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:07,879
So what's the backstory on Army and Jen?

757
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,096
They dated for a few years.
Lived together for a while.

758
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:13,660
Army was in the show back
then, so he traveled a lot.

759
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:14,649
What happened?

760
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:18,232
Army got a serious
problem with redheads.

761
00:49:19,455 --> 00:49:21,213
A serious problem.

762
00:49:21,214 --> 00:49:22,789
I've never seen anything like it.

763
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:24,249
He goes apeshit for anything

764
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,310
with red hair and a set of cans.

765
00:49:26,311 --> 00:49:27,629
Huh.

766
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,714
Jen comes home early
from the bar one night.

767
00:49:29,715 --> 00:49:32,273
Army's in the hot tub with two redheads.

768
00:49:32,274 --> 00:49:33,746
A mother-daughter deal.

769
00:49:33,747 --> 00:49:35,949
Found 'em at Walgreens
in the sunscreen aisle.

770
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,917
Oh, that makes sense.

771
00:49:37,918 --> 00:49:40,079
About a week later,
Jen gets the cable bill.

772
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,777
Super expensive.

773
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:44,887
Apparently Army ordered
like 10 porn movies.

774
00:49:44,888 --> 00:49:48,351
"Ginger Snatch," "Nobody
Does It Redder," "Red Boss."

775
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:49,997
But Jen's not a redhead.

776
00:49:49,998 --> 00:49:53,221
Actually, she is. She went
blonde after they split.

777
00:49:53,222 --> 00:49:54,951
- Really?
- Yup.

778
00:49:54,952 --> 00:49:57,909
Then Jen moved out a few days later,

779
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:00,993
and Army's never been the same since.

780
00:50:05,261 --> 00:50:07,380
Smoking will
let me prove to shorten

781
00:50:07,381 --> 00:50:10,428
the days in which you exist, Michael.

782
00:50:10,429 --> 00:50:12,024
I know.

783
00:50:12,025 --> 00:50:13,775
I wish I never existed.

784
00:50:13,776 --> 00:50:17,515
Nonsense. You are a young man.

785
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:21,395
You have a long and
fruitful life ahead of you.

786
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:24,974
It doesn't matter. I'm gonna be alone.

787
00:50:24,975 --> 00:50:26,725
Rich proposed to Jen.

788
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:29,245
She said yes.

789
00:50:29,246 --> 00:50:31,597
She actually accepted.

790
00:50:31,598 --> 00:50:33,499
Apparently you don't know Jen

791
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,803
as well as you think you do.

792
00:50:35,804 --> 00:50:37,471
Yeah, I guess not.

793
00:50:38,582 --> 00:50:41,300
It doesn't matter anyway, though.

794
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:42,633
It's done.

795
00:50:42,634 --> 00:50:43,634
She's gone.

796
00:50:44,766 --> 00:50:46,216
I'm fucked.

797
00:50:46,217 --> 00:50:48,023
Sometimes all a woman wants

798
00:50:48,024 --> 00:50:50,343
is to see you fight for her.

799
00:50:50,344 --> 00:50:51,954
It gives her confidence that you want

800
00:50:51,955 --> 00:50:55,283
the relationship as much as she does.

801
00:50:55,284 --> 00:50:58,270
Yeah, I guess that makes sense, huh?

802
00:50:58,271 --> 00:51:00,491
Where's the
boy that left home alone

803
00:51:00,492 --> 00:51:05,049
at 14 years of age to
pursue his hockey career?

804
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:06,186
Right here.

805
00:51:06,187 --> 00:51:08,661
And where's the
young man everyone's said

806
00:51:08,662 --> 00:51:12,994
was too small and too
slow to be successful?

807
00:51:12,995 --> 00:51:13,828
Right here.

808
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:17,361
And where's the man
who worked his derriere off

809
00:51:17,362 --> 00:51:20,112
in order to prove everyone wrong?

810
00:51:21,046 --> 00:51:21,879
Right here.

811
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,490
Then go in there, Michael,

812
00:51:23,491 --> 00:51:25,269
and fight for what you want.

813
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:27,661
You are your only obstacle.

814
00:51:27,662 --> 00:51:28,720
You're right.

815
00:51:28,721 --> 00:51:30,888
Ha-ha! Excelsior!

816
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:42,083
Get you another water?

817
00:51:42,084 --> 00:51:43,084
No thanks.

818
00:51:45,454 --> 00:51:50,100
Can I ask what you're doing
in a bar in your condition?

819
00:51:50,101 --> 00:51:52,018
Um, I'm running away.

820
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:55,261
Running away?

821
00:51:55,262 --> 00:51:56,929
With my boyfriend.

822
00:51:58,183 --> 00:51:59,662
Why?

823
00:51:59,663 --> 00:52:01,996
My parents, they hate him.

824
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,130
Well, I would, too.

825
00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:10,890
Can I ask how old you are?

826
00:52:10,891 --> 00:52:11,974
Um, I'm 16.

827
00:52:12,917 --> 00:52:15,276
16? You're just a kid.

828
00:52:15,277 --> 00:52:17,746
Now you sound just like my parents.

829
00:52:17,747 --> 00:52:18,747
I'm sorry.

830
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:22,265
Well, how old's your boyfriend?

831
00:52:22,266 --> 00:52:24,886
Let me guess. He's 17.

832
00:52:24,887 --> 00:52:26,220
He's, he's 22.

833
00:52:27,217 --> 00:52:28,217
22?

834
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:31,648
Man.

835
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:32,910
Well, what does he do?

836
00:52:32,911 --> 00:52:36,030
He works construction. Part-time.

837
00:52:36,031 --> 00:52:38,880
Listen, it's none of my business,

838
00:52:38,881 --> 00:52:42,270
but you should really think
twice before running away

839
00:52:42,271 --> 00:52:47,001
with a 22-year-old part-time
construction worker.

840
00:52:47,002 --> 00:52:49,022
I mean, I was 22 once,

841
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,704
and I know I wasn't
ready for a wife and kid.

842
00:52:51,705 --> 00:52:52,705
Shit.

843
00:52:53,453 --> 00:52:55,120
I'm still not ready.

844
00:52:57,984 --> 00:52:59,695
Well, where is he, anyway?

845
00:52:59,696 --> 00:53:02,526
I mean, you've been sitting
here for like two hours.

846
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:05,110
He isn't answering his phone.

847
00:53:09,626 --> 00:53:12,706
Look, I'll get you some
more water. You hungry?

848
00:53:12,707 --> 00:53:15,033
Maybe some crackers.

849
00:53:15,034 --> 00:53:16,756
All right.

850
00:53:16,757 --> 00:53:19,090
But think about what I said.

851
00:53:25,014 --> 00:53:27,453
So I met this blonde.

852
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:32,021
Her name was Bambi or

853
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,453
Bunny or something.

854
00:53:37,043 --> 00:53:39,293
She worked at a strip club.

855
00:53:41,553 --> 00:53:42,803
She was so hot.

856
00:53:43,915 --> 00:53:45,832
I paid for a lap dance.

857
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:52,083
Two songs in and I got my
hands where they don't belong.

858
00:53:52,121 --> 00:53:54,884
Well, one thing leads to another,

859
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:59,135
and we're both drunk, so
we head back to her place.

860
00:54:00,894 --> 00:54:04,477
She pounces on me as
soon as we get inside.

861
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:09,642
So we're making out and
our clothes hit the floor.

862
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:14,564
We're butt-ass naked,
and she's grinding on me.

863
00:54:15,648 --> 00:54:17,898
I think she was a squirter.

864
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:20,714
I don't remember.

865
00:54:21,778 --> 00:54:26,378
You know what I'm talking
about, right?

866
00:54:26,379 --> 00:54:27,379
Anyway.

867
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:30,224
I got whiskey dick,

868
00:54:31,071 --> 00:54:32,071
and I couldn't even-

869
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,340
Son of a...

870
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:38,947
What's up, Army?

871
00:54:38,948 --> 00:54:40,485
I need you to bring my dog back.

872
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,035
I told you I'm on it.

873
00:54:42,036 --> 00:54:43,966
Come on. Fuck,
man, I'm missing my dog.

874
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:48,467
Chillax, big man, you're
gonna blow a gasket. Later.

875
00:54:50,035 --> 00:54:51,035
Sheesh.

876
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:54,636
Anyway, where was I?

877
00:54:55,939 --> 00:54:56,939
Oh yeah.

878
00:54:57,758 --> 00:55:01,758
Buffy.

879
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:09,541
Where the fuck is Murray?

880
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:15,190
- He did a good job.
- Yeah, definitely, definitely.

881
00:55:15,191 --> 00:55:16,731
It's awesome. Congratulations.

882
00:55:16,732 --> 00:55:18,336
It's back to reality for you.

883
00:55:18,337 --> 00:55:19,170
Yeah.

884
00:55:19,171 --> 00:55:23,003
- Can't believe it's real.
- He did a good job.

885
00:55:24,674 --> 00:55:27,494
Uh, we haven't discussed
it yet. We'll see.

886
00:55:27,495 --> 00:55:28,662
Oh, hey, baby.

887
00:55:40,443 --> 00:55:42,010
Hey, can I fill my water bottle?

888
00:55:42,011 --> 00:55:44,011
Sure. You want Hazed or White Rascal?

889
00:55:44,012 --> 00:55:46,735
No, no. I'm hoping to get
at least 50 fun miles today.

890
00:55:46,736 --> 00:55:49,484
Yeah, this sounds real fun.

891
00:55:49,485 --> 00:55:52,993
Nice place, by the
way. Do you serve vegan?

892
00:55:52,994 --> 00:55:55,899
No, we don't serve
vegan, paleo, organic,

893
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,146
gluten free, or any of that
other shit you guys eat.

894
00:55:58,147 --> 00:56:00,061
We serve beer, wings, and burgers.

895
00:56:00,062 --> 00:56:01,278
Don't ask me to hold the fucking bike.

896
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,112
- I didn't mean to-
- Listen.

897
00:56:02,113 --> 00:56:03,182
Can I ask you a question?

898
00:56:03,183 --> 00:56:04,016
Why the hell do you guys wear

899
00:56:04,017 --> 00:56:05,788
those stupid fucking getups anyway.

900
00:56:05,789 --> 00:56:07,547
I mean, why don't you just
wear a T-shirt and shorts,

901
00:56:07,548 --> 00:56:09,021
like normal fucking people?

902
00:56:09,022 --> 00:56:10,957
Frankly, you don't have the build for it.

903
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:13,491
And another thing, stay
the fuck off the road.

904
00:56:13,492 --> 00:56:15,918
I almost pick one of
you off every other day.

905
00:56:15,919 --> 00:56:18,417
The roads are made for
cars, for Christ's sake.

906
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:21,074
And you bring your bike
into my fucking bar?

907
00:56:21,075 --> 00:56:23,570
It's probably worth more
than your Subaru, am I right?

908
00:56:23,571 --> 00:56:24,844
Yeah, how much money can you spend

909
00:56:24,845 --> 00:56:26,713
on two wheels in a handlebar?

910
00:56:26,714 --> 00:56:29,374
You wanna get in shape?
Buy a fucking weight set.

911
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:31,600
Just stay off the goddamn road.

912
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:32,684
See you soon.

913
00:56:44,421 --> 00:56:47,565
So are we a go for
Operation Reservoir Dogs?

914
00:56:47,566 --> 00:56:49,566
- Yeah.
- Reservoir Dogs?

915
00:56:50,538 --> 00:56:54,151
You'll see. Time to show
Jen just how awesome I am.

916
00:56:54,152 --> 00:56:57,820
I thought your intent was
to expose Rich as a fraud.

917
00:56:57,821 --> 00:56:58,986
Well, yeah, but-

918
00:56:58,987 --> 00:57:03,168
- Yeah, but we couldn't
come up with a good plan.

919
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:07,669
Well, I had an idea, but
I'm hesitant to suggest it.

920
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,640
What is it?

921
00:57:13,256 --> 00:57:16,110
You say this guy has an
overactive libido, right?

922
00:57:16,111 --> 00:57:19,111
He doesn't wear swimsuits, Walter.

923
00:57:20,077 --> 00:57:21,554
Yes.

924
00:57:21,555 --> 00:57:23,222
Well, hear me out.

925
00:57:36,216 --> 00:57:39,299
I ain't going to
your car. I just got here.

926
00:57:55,526 --> 00:57:58,026
I'll catch up with you guys.

927
00:58:00,396 --> 00:58:01,396
Hey, Army.

928
00:58:02,866 --> 00:58:05,283
Is that your Jersey up there?

929
00:58:06,718 --> 00:58:07,718
Yeah.

930
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:12,973
So you used to play in the pros?

931
00:58:12,974 --> 00:58:13,974
Yeah.

932
00:58:14,669 --> 00:58:16,125
Wow.

933
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:17,126
That's hot.

934
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:19,874
Oh boy. A redhead.

935
00:58:21,007 --> 00:58:23,224
Yeah, it's not good, bud.

936
00:58:23,225 --> 00:58:24,558
I have to pee.

937
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:30,750
I'll be in the ladies'
room if you need me.

938
00:58:31,816 --> 00:58:36,816
And by the way, I'm not
wearing any panties.

939
00:58:37,917 --> 00:58:40,667
Uh.

940
00:58:42,693 --> 00:58:43,693
Ah.

941
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:47,292
Hey.

942
00:58:48,561 --> 00:58:49,561
Uh, listen.

943
00:58:50,424 --> 00:58:51,424
I, um,

944
00:58:52,133 --> 00:58:53,466
I can't do that.

945
00:58:55,543 --> 00:58:58,679
You're a really beautiful girl,

946
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,013
and normally I would jump at the chance,

947
00:59:03,313 --> 00:59:05,765
but you're drunk and you'd regret it.

948
00:59:05,766 --> 00:59:09,678
So how about you go take care of business

949
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,346
and I'll call you a ride, on me?

950
00:59:22,409 --> 00:59:23,985
Hey, bud.

951
00:59:23,986 --> 00:59:25,502
Um,

952
00:59:25,503 --> 00:59:26,586
are you okay?

953
00:59:27,528 --> 00:59:29,119
Yeah.

954
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:29,953
Really?

955
00:59:29,954 --> 00:59:34,521
Because you just turned
down an absolute smoke show.

956
00:59:34,522 --> 00:59:36,420
She's drunk, man.

957
00:59:36,421 --> 00:59:40,161
Exactly.

958
00:59:40,162 --> 00:59:41,995
I'm impressed, Army.

959
00:59:45,032 --> 00:59:46,032
Armstrong.

960
00:59:47,825 --> 00:59:50,075
- What?
- Where is my stuff?

961
00:59:57,778 --> 01:00:00,328
Listen, you're really bad.

962
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:01,746
I mean, you suck.

963
01:00:02,918 --> 01:00:06,054
Nobody wants to listen to your shit.

964
01:00:06,055 --> 01:00:07,888
Fuck you, Armstrong.

965
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:13,149
Hey! Everybody, quiet down.

966
01:00:14,585 --> 01:00:19,585
Who wants to hear some more
of this guy's shitty music?

967
01:00:21,877 --> 01:00:23,117
Boo!

968
01:00:23,118 --> 01:00:24,727
You suck.

969
01:00:24,728 --> 01:00:29,681
You heard 'em, Ringo. Why
don't you, uh, call it a night?

970
01:00:29,682 --> 01:00:32,398
Mr. Jones is gonna hear about this.

971
01:00:32,399 --> 01:00:33,816
Whatever, Dick.

972
01:00:35,019 --> 01:00:36,519
Hey that's okay.

973
01:00:37,473 --> 01:00:40,620
We're gonna do this the old-fashioned way.

974
01:00:40,621 --> 01:00:42,100
Just me and my guitar.

975
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:47,410
Get off the stage!

976
01:00:54,709 --> 01:00:56,885
Oh, hey, how are the wings?

977
01:00:56,886 --> 01:00:58,176
- Great.
- They're great.

978
01:00:58,177 --> 01:00:59,584
I told you so.

979
01:00:59,585 --> 01:01:01,944
Hey, listen, what size sneakers you wear?

980
01:01:01,945 --> 01:01:04,466
I think my sister might have
some old skates you can use.

981
01:01:04,467 --> 01:01:05,714
I,

982
01:01:05,715 --> 01:01:06,917
I don't know.
Oh, hold on.

983
01:01:06,918 --> 01:01:08,001
I'll be back.

984
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,160
Reservoir Dogs is a go.

985
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:21,244
I'm not a part of this.

986
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:36,982
Open the cash register! Put it in here!

987
01:01:41,588 --> 01:01:42,588
Get back!

988
01:01:43,945 --> 01:01:44,934
Okay. Calm down.

989
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,017
Just do it!

990
01:01:47,758 --> 01:01:50,675
What are you looking at, numb nuts?

991
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:54,549
He pissed himself!

992
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:56,217
Hurry the fuck up!

993
01:01:59,497 --> 01:02:01,326
Dude, what the fuck?

994
01:02:01,327 --> 01:02:02,327
Silent!

995
01:02:03,379 --> 01:02:04,796
No, wait, wait!

996
01:02:06,106 --> 01:02:07,610
Leave him.

997
01:02:07,611 --> 01:02:09,023
Guys.

998
01:02:09,024 --> 01:02:12,411
No, wait.

999
01:02:12,412 --> 01:02:14,745
Just let him go. Let him go!

1000
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:22,432
What the fuck, Army?

1001
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:26,431
I think you got him.

1002
01:02:26,432 --> 01:02:27,432
Good.

1003
01:02:36,907 --> 01:02:37,907
Hey, guys.

1004
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,402
Thanks for your help back there.

1005
01:02:40,403 --> 01:02:41,902
No problem.

1006
01:02:41,903 --> 01:02:44,848
Listen, sorry for being a dick earlier.

1007
01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:48,877
It's just, uh, my uncle,
he got hurt in Iraq.

1008
01:02:48,878 --> 01:02:50,628
Sorry to hear that.

1009
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:53,221
You guys really in the Air Force?

1010
01:02:53,222 --> 01:02:54,222
Yes, sir.

1011
01:02:55,982 --> 01:02:56,982
Here.

1012
01:02:59,114 --> 01:03:01,975
To the best damn military in the world.

1013
01:03:01,976 --> 01:03:02,976
Cheers.

1014
01:03:07,526 --> 01:03:10,312
Hey, did I hear that guy yell
your name when he ran out?

1015
01:03:10,313 --> 01:03:13,456
Yeah, yeah. He's my best friend.

1016
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:14,316
Long story.

1017
01:03:14,317 --> 01:03:17,645
I was gonna chase him outta
here and impress a girl.

1018
01:03:17,646 --> 01:03:19,607
Sounds kinda fucked up.

1019
01:03:19,608 --> 01:03:20,441
Yeah.

1020
01:03:20,442 --> 01:03:22,026
Sorry we ruined your plan.

1021
01:03:22,027 --> 01:03:23,793
It's not a problem.

1022
01:03:23,794 --> 01:03:26,377
I got more tricks up my sleeve.

1023
01:03:45,456 --> 01:03:47,225
What the fuck, Army?

1024
01:03:47,226 --> 01:03:49,425
The guy almost broke my fucking wrist.

1025
01:03:49,426 --> 01:03:51,117
Calm down, Jesse James.

1026
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,439
That plan was clearly flawed.

1027
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,787
Yeah, no shit, but they fucked-

1028
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:55,955
- Look, forget about that.

1029
01:03:57,117 --> 01:03:58,968
Rich is in the bathroom.

1030
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:01,136
Time to try Walter's plan.

1031
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:06,201
Hey, what is fucking wrong here?

1032
01:04:06,202 --> 01:04:08,285
I fucking hate Armstrong.

1033
01:04:31,053 --> 01:04:33,136
Jesus H. Christ.

1034
01:04:36,304 --> 01:04:37,304
Whoa! Oh!

1035
01:04:38,651 --> 01:04:39,734
Take it easy.

1036
01:04:41,428 --> 01:04:42,511
Take it easy.

1037
01:04:43,688 --> 01:04:45,036
Oh!

1038
01:04:45,037 --> 01:04:46,420
Ah!

1039
01:04:46,421 --> 01:04:47,353
Gah!

1040
01:04:47,354 --> 01:04:49,201
Oh, I'm close, I'm close, I'm close,

1041
01:04:49,202 --> 01:04:51,037
I'm close, I'm close,
I'm close, I'm close,

1042
01:04:51,038 --> 01:04:53,236
I'm close, I'm close,
I'm close, I'm close,

1043
01:04:53,237 --> 01:04:55,717
I'm close, I'm close, I'm
close, I'm close, I'm close.

1044
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:28,363
Lay off the garlic, honey.

1045
01:05:53,235 --> 01:05:54,235
Well.

1046
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:58,473
Now we know how you got all
the ladies in high school.

1047
01:05:58,474 --> 01:05:59,648
What?

1048
01:05:59,649 --> 01:06:01,375
And I thought you were gay.

1049
01:06:01,376 --> 01:06:02,507
You're gay.

1050
01:06:02,508 --> 01:06:04,710
Uh, that's not what
your mom said last night.

1051
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:09,065
Well, my mom's gay,
so that makes you gay.

1052
01:06:09,066 --> 01:06:10,163
Fuck.

1053
01:06:10,164 --> 01:06:12,287
You see a glory hole in there?

1054
01:06:12,288 --> 01:06:13,287
Nope.

1055
01:06:13,288 --> 01:06:17,370
Huh, that's funny, 'cause
Gale said he saw one.

1056
01:06:19,134 --> 01:06:21,351
You assholes think you're
pretty clever, don't ya?

1057
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,089
Yeah, buddy.

1058
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:25,348
Yeah. We'll, fuck you.

1059
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:27,368
It's your word against mine.

1060
01:06:27,369 --> 01:06:30,214
Well, Scott's video says otherwise.

1061
01:06:39,951 --> 01:06:41,294
You set me up!

1062
01:06:41,295 --> 01:06:45,378
Calm down. We can make
this all just disappear.

1063
01:06:46,351 --> 01:06:47,934
What do you want?

1064
01:06:48,993 --> 01:06:52,405
Simple, call off the
bullshit engagement,

1065
01:06:52,406 --> 01:06:55,112
break up with Jen, and
get the fuck outta here.

1066
01:06:55,113 --> 01:06:56,113
Fuck you!

1067
01:06:58,127 --> 01:07:02,276
Look, as I see it, you got two choices.

1068
01:07:02,277 --> 01:07:03,655
You can either do what I tell you,

1069
01:07:03,656 --> 01:07:06,127
or Scott here is gonna
take this little gem

1070
01:07:06,128 --> 01:07:07,956
and post it on Facebook.

1071
01:07:07,957 --> 01:07:10,140
I'd say, what, about a million views

1072
01:07:10,141 --> 01:07:12,391
in a half hour, huh, Scott?

1073
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:21,857
Why not, huh? I was never
gonna marry that bitch anyway.

1074
01:07:21,858 --> 01:07:22,691
What?

1075
01:07:22,692 --> 01:07:26,081
One vagina for the rest of my life?

1076
01:07:26,082 --> 01:07:27,424
Hmm, no thank you.

1077
01:07:27,425 --> 01:07:29,204
But the diamond.

1078
01:07:29,205 --> 01:07:30,205
Diamond?

1079
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:34,361
Are you nuts? There's no diamond.

1080
01:07:34,362 --> 01:07:35,674
Well, why, then?

1081
01:07:35,675 --> 01:07:38,896
Revenge, motherfucker, revenge.

1082
01:07:38,897 --> 01:07:39,897
Revenge?

1083
01:07:41,135 --> 01:07:44,385
Tracy Dildorf, high school. Remember?

1084
01:07:45,582 --> 01:07:46,669
Yes, I do.

1085
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:49,786
Yeah. Well, I lost my virginity to her.

1086
01:07:49,787 --> 01:07:52,249
I gave her my class ring,
supposed to marry her,

1087
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:54,762
and then you-
Yes, I did.

1088
01:07:54,763 --> 01:07:56,033
But I didn't know she was with you.

1089
01:07:56,034 --> 01:07:57,284
Oh, bullshit.

1090
01:07:59,674 --> 01:08:01,632
Listen, that's what this is all about?

1091
01:08:01,633 --> 01:08:04,946
Yeah, but it doesn't matter,

1092
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:09,024
because Jen's never gonna end up with you.

1093
01:08:09,025 --> 01:08:11,564
Get that through your head, huh?

1094
01:08:15,616 --> 01:08:16,642
Do it now.

1095
01:08:16,643 --> 01:08:20,700
Tell Jen the truth or you
leave here in a fucking box.

1096
01:08:20,701 --> 01:08:21,614
Aw.

1097
01:08:21,615 --> 01:08:24,255
Okay, buddy, okay, okay.

1098
01:08:24,256 --> 01:08:25,506
Okay, let's go.

1099
01:08:55,445 --> 01:08:57,503
I miss him already.

1100
01:08:57,504 --> 01:09:01,609
Okay, now's your chance.
She's in a fragile state.

1101
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:04,543
Chicks do dumb shit when
they're in a fragile state.

1102
01:09:04,544 --> 01:09:06,378
I don't wanna take advantage of her.

1103
01:09:06,379 --> 01:09:07,706
You don't?

1104
01:09:07,707 --> 01:09:08,707
No.

1105
01:09:12,706 --> 01:09:15,195
I don't know what you did,

1106
01:09:15,196 --> 01:09:17,288
but I know you had something do with this.

1107
01:09:17,289 --> 01:09:18,866
Jen, I wanted to tell you about asshole.

1108
01:09:18,867 --> 01:09:19,867
Shut up!

1109
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:22,649
Just leave me alone.

1110
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,350
What's up, Coop?

1111
01:09:59,968 --> 01:10:02,661
We've gotta go, my man.

1112
01:10:02,662 --> 01:10:03,662
Come on.

1113
01:10:12,194 --> 01:10:13,662
Anything else for you guys?

1114
01:10:13,663 --> 01:10:14,988
No thanks. We're stuffed.

1115
01:10:14,989 --> 01:10:16,378
Yeah.

1116
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:17,882
It's quite an eventful day in here.

1117
01:10:17,883 --> 01:10:19,339
Is it always like this?

1118
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,757
Uh, not really.

1119
01:10:21,855 --> 01:10:22,779
About those skates.

1120
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,156
Hey, um, can I talk to you again?

1121
01:10:25,157 --> 01:10:26,157
Yeah, of course.

1122
01:10:31,506 --> 01:10:33,771
Uh, listen, Charlie really likes you,

1123
01:10:33,772 --> 01:10:36,471
but she's not gonna be
able to skate with you.

1124
01:10:36,472 --> 01:10:39,121
It's just a skate. No checking.

1125
01:10:39,122 --> 01:10:42,379
Uh, Charlie didn't really hurt her leg.

1126
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:45,202
She just says that
'cause she's embarrassed.

1127
01:10:45,203 --> 01:10:46,551
Embarrassed?

1128
01:10:46,552 --> 01:10:47,979
She was diagnosed with a form

1129
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:51,122
of muscular dystrophy when she was three.

1130
01:10:51,123 --> 01:10:55,273
She's got breathing
issues and heart issues.

1131
01:10:55,274 --> 01:10:57,657
She'll never walk again.

1132
01:11:00,632 --> 01:11:01,632
What?

1133
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:08,684
Is everything okay?

1134
01:11:13,981 --> 01:11:17,207
I have never seen him like that before.

1135
01:11:17,208 --> 01:11:19,187
What's going on.

1136
01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:37,987
You seem quite subdued, Michael.

1137
01:11:41,692 --> 01:11:43,109
It's my friend.

1138
01:11:44,035 --> 01:11:45,035
She's sick.

1139
01:11:45,979 --> 01:11:47,733
Really sick.

1140
01:11:47,734 --> 01:11:49,901
Life is fleeting.

1141
01:11:50,874 --> 01:11:53,111
She's just a kid.

1142
01:11:53,112 --> 01:11:55,559
The illness of someone close

1143
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:59,708
reminds us that we are
still alive and healthy,

1144
01:11:59,709 --> 01:12:02,459
perhaps for some greater purpose.

1145
01:12:04,308 --> 01:12:06,451
It's just not fair.

1146
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:11,228
My suggestion is to
honor your friend's misfortune

1147
01:12:11,229 --> 01:12:14,360
by using it in a positive manner.

1148
01:12:14,361 --> 01:12:17,694
Ask yourself, if your time were limited,

1149
01:12:18,992 --> 01:12:22,500
what would you seek to accomplish?

1150
01:12:22,501 --> 01:12:24,908
It's a great question.

1151
01:12:40,414 --> 01:12:41,797
You still waiting?

1152
01:12:41,798 --> 01:12:43,881
Yeah. He's always late.

1153
01:12:46,187 --> 01:12:47,547
Yeah.

1154
01:12:47,548 --> 01:12:50,048
You know, life's pretty tough.

1155
01:12:50,923 --> 01:12:53,340
And you add a baby to that...

1156
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,901
You're gonna need your parents' help.

1157
01:12:59,902 --> 01:13:02,002
You can't do this alone.

1158
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:10,737
Things will get better. Trust me.

1159
01:13:10,738 --> 01:13:13,754
I've made a terrible mistake.

1160
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:15,505
I just wanna go home.

1161
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:18,417
I know.

1162
01:13:25,218 --> 01:13:26,551
How did you...

1163
01:13:55,628 --> 01:13:56,711
Son of a...

1164
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:00,467
Stay here, Coop.

1165
01:14:04,997 --> 01:14:07,484
What's up, knob jockey?

1166
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:11,361
What the fuck, Murray?
Where have you been?

1167
01:14:11,362 --> 01:14:12,445
Where's Coop?

1168
01:14:15,690 --> 01:14:18,107
Relax. He's out in the car.

1169
01:14:19,256 --> 01:14:20,388
Out in the car?

1170
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:21,542
Yeah.

1171
01:14:21,543 --> 01:14:24,876
The sign outside said "No Pets Allowed."

1172
01:14:26,221 --> 01:14:27,221
Idiot!

1173
01:14:34,118 --> 01:14:35,118
Cooper!

1174
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,850
He was right here.

1175
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:43,269
Murray, you could screw up a free lunch.

1176
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:46,030
Army, you got a call. It's your agent.

1177
01:14:46,031 --> 01:14:46,864
Bobby?

1178
01:14:46,865 --> 01:14:49,036
He said it's important, bud.

1179
01:14:49,037 --> 01:14:51,286
Shit. I gotta take this call.

1180
01:14:51,287 --> 01:14:52,704
You keep looking.

1181
01:15:02,442 --> 01:15:03,442
What?

1182
01:15:06,063 --> 01:15:07,063
Really?

1183
01:15:08,622 --> 01:15:09,622
Rescinded?

1184
01:15:13,044 --> 01:15:14,044
LA?

1185
01:15:16,414 --> 01:15:17,664
Two weeks, huh?

1186
01:15:18,666 --> 01:15:20,583
I thought you fired me.

1187
01:15:22,123 --> 01:15:23,999
Yeah, hold on a sec.

1188
01:15:26,183 --> 01:15:28,223
What's going on?

1189
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:31,668
Player's association had
my suspension overturned.

1190
01:15:31,669 --> 01:15:33,201
LA wants to sign me.

1191
01:15:33,202 --> 01:15:38,074
LA? You always wanted to
play in Cali, bud.

1192
01:15:49,974 --> 01:15:51,947
Tell 'em I'm not interested.

1193
01:15:51,948 --> 01:15:54,222
I got too many things to do.

1194
01:15:54,223 --> 01:15:56,223
I've wasted enough time.

1195
01:15:57,965 --> 01:15:59,215
Yeah, I'm sure.

1196
01:16:00,525 --> 01:16:03,192
Oh, and Bobby, go fuck yourself.

1197
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:06,648
What?

1198
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:16,717
Look what I just found in the alley.

1199
01:16:17,713 --> 01:16:19,108
Cooper!

1200
01:16:19,109 --> 01:16:20,567
Cooper!

1201
01:16:20,568 --> 01:16:22,401
Hey, bud. I missed ya.

1202
01:16:24,118 --> 01:16:25,108
What happened?

1203
01:16:25,109 --> 01:16:27,414
I was just walking
home down main street,

1204
01:16:27,415 --> 01:16:30,879
and this guy come running by with Cooper.

1205
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,657
I knew something was
wrong, so I grabbed him.

1206
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:34,975
Nice work, Gale.

1207
01:16:34,976 --> 01:16:36,932
What are we gonna do with this butthole?

1208
01:16:36,933 --> 01:16:39,997
Oh, let me take him home.

1209
01:16:39,998 --> 01:16:41,248
He owes me one.

1210
01:16:49,523 --> 01:16:53,335
Come on, meat stick. We're
gonna soil some sheets tonight.

1211
01:16:53,336 --> 01:16:54,662
Oh.

1212
01:16:54,663 --> 01:16:55,663
No!

1213
01:16:57,624 --> 01:16:58,624
No!

1214
01:17:00,236 --> 01:17:01,236
No!

1215
01:17:05,216 --> 01:17:06,883
Missed you, buddy.

1216
01:17:09,533 --> 01:17:12,752
Hey, Coop. I missed you too.

1217
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:15,253
I haven't seen you in a while.

1218
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:20,682
Hey, listen.

1219
01:17:22,604 --> 01:17:23,604
I, uh,

1220
01:17:25,254 --> 01:17:27,663
I know you don't wanna talk to me,

1221
01:17:27,664 --> 01:17:29,366
and you probably hate me,

1222
01:17:29,367 --> 01:17:30,367
but-
Just

1223
01:17:31,287 --> 01:17:32,287
stop.

1224
01:17:36,774 --> 01:17:38,107
Come on, Coop.

1225
01:17:40,045 --> 01:17:42,295
Scott told me everything.

1226
01:17:43,775 --> 01:17:45,443
I think I owe you an apology.

1227
01:17:45,444 --> 01:17:47,410
Like, I was never gonna marry that guy.

1228
01:17:47,411 --> 01:17:52,279
He just caught me off guard
with all the people...

1229
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:57,280
Okay, I just wanted to see
what you would do, all right?

1230
01:17:57,531 --> 01:18:01,324
Really? You did all of that for me?

1231
01:18:01,325 --> 01:18:03,883
Yeah, but that doesn't change anything.

1232
01:18:03,884 --> 01:18:05,840
You still hurt me, and I don't know if-

1233
01:18:05,841 --> 01:18:06,841
- Stop.

1234
01:18:07,991 --> 01:18:11,805
I wanna prove to you I can
be the man you want me to be.

1235
01:18:11,806 --> 01:18:13,926
It's gonna take some time.

1236
01:18:13,927 --> 01:18:15,094
A lot of time.

1237
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:17,823
I'm willing to wait.

1238
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:23,923
Look, let's go out tomorrow night.

1239
01:18:25,055 --> 01:18:27,936
Just you, me, Medieval Times.

1240
01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:30,278
Love Medieval Times.

1241
01:18:30,279 --> 01:18:33,270
How about we start with a cup of coffee

1242
01:18:33,271 --> 01:18:35,152
and just see how things go?

1243
01:18:35,153 --> 01:18:37,320
It's good enough for me.

1244
01:18:43,246 --> 01:18:45,192
Before you two start making plans,

1245
01:18:45,193 --> 01:18:47,511
I have a confession to make.

1246
01:18:47,512 --> 01:18:48,893
What's that?

1247
01:18:48,894 --> 01:18:50,532
I'm not really a salesman.

1248
01:18:50,533 --> 01:18:54,358
Ah, that's okay. I'm
not really a gynecologist.

1249
01:18:54,359 --> 01:18:56,109
I thought you were!

1250
01:18:58,314 --> 01:18:59,605
What do you do?

1251
01:18:59,606 --> 01:19:02,595
I run a youth hockey
program here in Boulder.

1252
01:19:02,596 --> 01:19:03,534
As a matter of fact,

1253
01:19:03,535 --> 01:19:07,202
one of our board members
recommended we hire you.

1254
01:19:07,203 --> 01:19:08,264
Me?

1255
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:11,962
I heard a lot about you, mostly bad,

1256
01:19:11,963 --> 01:19:13,805
so I came down to see for myself.

1257
01:19:13,806 --> 01:19:14,806
Oh boy.

1258
01:19:16,006 --> 01:19:17,006
And?

1259
01:19:18,582 --> 01:19:22,353
I almost left 30
minutes after I sat down.

1260
01:19:22,354 --> 01:19:26,854
The way you treated women,
minorities, I was appalled.

1261
01:19:28,820 --> 01:19:31,726
But something kept me here.

1262
01:19:31,727 --> 01:19:33,007
What's that?

1263
01:19:33,008 --> 01:19:37,579
Maybe it's the soap opera
playing out between you two.

1264
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:38,620
Maybe it's the way you treated

1265
01:19:38,621 --> 01:19:40,684
that little girl in the wheelchair.

1266
01:19:40,685 --> 01:19:43,760
I'm not sure, but I had a feeling.

1267
01:19:43,761 --> 01:19:47,698
We're looking for a new hockey director.

1268
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:49,464
I wanna offer you the job.

1269
01:19:49,465 --> 01:19:52,732
It pays $85,000 a year, plus bonuses.

1270
01:19:52,733 --> 01:19:57,573
It includes health insurance,
401k, all the usual stuff.

1271
01:19:57,574 --> 01:19:59,556
There's limited travel, but of course-

1272
01:19:59,557 --> 01:20:00,557
- Yes, yes!

1273
01:20:03,157 --> 01:20:04,726
Of course, there'll be a drug test.

1274
01:20:04,727 --> 01:20:07,644
Great. What drugs are we testing?

1275
01:20:10,243 --> 01:20:11,717
Gabe, you'll never
believe what just happened.

1276
01:20:11,718 --> 01:20:12,718
I got...

1277
01:20:13,657 --> 01:20:14,657
Gabe?

1278
01:20:15,636 --> 01:20:16,636
Gabe!

1279
01:20:19,057 --> 01:20:22,734
Hey, Murray, where's that
box that was out here?

1280
01:20:22,735 --> 01:20:23,624
What box?

1281
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:25,729
The cardboard box.

1282
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:28,009
It's been here for weeks. Gabe's box.

1283
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:32,305
Dude, the only box out
here is in between your legs.

1284
01:20:35,098 --> 01:20:36,098
Oh, geez.

1285
01:20:36,877 --> 01:20:41,210
The only box out here is
between your legs. Classic.

1286
01:21:20,567 --> 01:21:23,906
"Bison" on three. One, two, three.

1287
01:21:23,907 --> 01:21:25,157
Bison!

1288
01:22:12,226 --> 01:22:15,453
All right, quit hitting him in the butt.
