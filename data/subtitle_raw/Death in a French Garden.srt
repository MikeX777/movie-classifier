00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:54,512
DEATH IN A FRENCH GARDEN

2
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,503
Excuse me. Are you David Aurphet?

3
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,969
Yes, I am.

4
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:02,223
I was worried I was late.
Julia Tombsthay.

5
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,607
My husband and daughter are here,
anyway. My new neighbour.

6
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,835
I'm Edwige Ledieu.
I moved in this morning.

7
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,672
- Let's introduce ourselves right away.
- Good idea.

8
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,548
- Julia Tombsthay.
- Mr Tombsthay?

9
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:38,259
No, Mr Aurphet is my daughter's
guitar teacher.

10
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:42,472
- Excuse me.
- The future teacher...

11
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,266
- Are you happy with your moving men?
- Very much.

12
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,187
Well, see you soon. Delighted.
Goodbye.

13
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,773
Who knows?

14
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,904
Are you coming?

15
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,508
You wouldn't think you're in the city.

16
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,720
No, you'd think you were in a garden.

17
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,850
My new neighbour's house.

18
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,148
I think my husband's waiting for us.

19
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,532
We were pleased when we learnt
that you were available.

20
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,076
Isn't that true, Graham?

21
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:49,956
After what we heard, my husband
wouldn't have any other teacher.

22
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:55,045
- By the way, where is she?
- Reading in my office at the moment.

23
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,299
I'm coming.

24
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,565
Viviane, my daughter. Mr David Aurphet.

25
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,652
- Hello, Miss Tombsthay.
- Hello.

26
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,448
You're able to earn a living
by teaching guitar?

27
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:30,038
No. I'm also a French teacher...
principally.

28
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,917
But this year, I gave up French...

29
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,461
Will three times a week be all right?

30
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,589
That's perhaps a little... That's fine.

31
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:44,302
- At your house, or here?
- I prefer that it be here.

32
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,845
As do l.

33
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,974
Here.

34
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,521
Do you want to see my guitar?
I warn you, it's pretty worthless.

35
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,524
Well, in that case...

36
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,653
I propose that we buy Viviane
a much better instrument.

37
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,115
- It will motivate her.
- When? Tomorrow?

38
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,576
If you want. Will you help us,
Mr Aurphet?

39
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,205
- Happily.
- Tomorrow, at eleven?

40
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,167
At the Oiseau-Lyre.

41
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,004
- What are you doing?
- I'm seeing you out.

42
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,383
Sorry, I mean, my factory makes
instruments for measuring vibrations.

43
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,552
All kinds of vibration.

44
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,729
I think they liked you.
But we didn't discuss your fee.

45
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:40,483
- 1 00... 1 50 francs per lesson.
- Perfect. See you soon.

46
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,278
Goodbye, sir...

47
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,712
- What did I lose?
- This.

48
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,589
Thank you.

49
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,553
I look like I've rushed over,
but don't believe it.

50
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,597
I didn't find your tuning fork
right away.

51
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,933
Where was it?

52
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,352
On the couch. It had slipped...

53
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:43,023
I hesitated before calling you,
then coming, then I changed...

54
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,359
I hesitated about that, too.
How do I look?

55
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,866
- Fine.
- Good. All right, then, I'll...

56
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,744
- Sit down.
-..sit. Where?

57
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,537
There.

58
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,540
All right, I repeat:
I sit down on the bed.

59
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,434
- You're playing this at the moment?
- Yes. Brahms.

60
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,227
- We're listening to it?
- No.

61
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:24,356
- It's pretty.
- What we're listening to? Yes.

62
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,650
I think my husband liked you a lot.

63
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:33,656
- Does the stove work?
- Yes.

64
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,201
But you have to wear a gas mask.

65
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,412
It smokes up the room.

66
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,465
Can I offer you a coffee,
or plum brandy? I don't have much.

67
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,051
I'd like that.

68
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,805
- Some brandy?
- Yes.

69
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,348
I like your place.

70
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,267
- A pity. I'm moving in five days.
- Why?

71
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,852
A habit.

72
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:07,899
Shall we organise a date now,
or wait till you have an address?

73
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,278
Thank you.

74
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,742
It's a small place, all alone in a park,
surrounded by other houses...

75
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:23,873
- So it's not alone, then.
- Yes. The others have been demolished.

76
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,252
One day, your place
will also be demolished.

77
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,670
Yes.

78
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,507
- You'll move again.
- Yes.

79
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:39,848
As for the next meetings,
we'll wait a little.

80
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,977
- You have a pretty ring.
- Yes.

81
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,396
Know why you're so desirable
at the moment?

82
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,482
Yes... No.

83
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,694
Because you're not trying to be.

84
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,058
I'll be on my way.

85
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,189
Watch your head!

86
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,872
Hi, Dad.

87
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,710
- What?
- That's right, your mother's returning.

88
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,840
- You're pleased?
- Yes.

89
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,760
But I'll need time to get used to it.

90
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:26,306
- When will she be here?
- In a couple of weeks.

91
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,100
Frankly, I never knew what she saw
in that Swiss.

92
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:36,232
- And your bomb, it's coming along?
- It's coming along.

93
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,693
What are you up to at the moment?

94
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:42,655
Stuffing myself like a pig,
then buying a guitar.

95
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,575
- For yourself?
- No, for the young woman.

96
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,919
Perhaps that one will do?

97
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,425
Which would you choose for yourself?

98
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,928
If price weren't an issue, this one.

99
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,888
So be it, darling.

100
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,308
Now I know how much it costs
to make you more agreeable.

101
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,689
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

102
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,651
- I don't like that boy.
- Nor do l.

103
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,696
- Can we see each other this afternoon?
- I'd like that.

104
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:26,199
- At the same time?
- Yes.

105
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,618
I'm parked down there.

106
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,124
- Is that her boyfriend?
- I don't know. Probably.

107
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,209
Does your husband not care, too?

108
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:40,672
He spoke to me about you again.
He'd like to hear you play.

109
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,967
I didn't tell you last night,
but I think you're beautiful.

110
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,178
See you soon. I can't wait.

111
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,369
- Hello.
- Hello.

112
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,288
- Things are going well...
- Well.

113
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,082
-..with the moving?
- Yes.

114
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,877
I've just got to hang a few things
on the wall.

115
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,088
- Photos?
- Amongst other things.

116
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:36,227
Can l... offer you a drink?

117
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:39,314
I... Why not?

118
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:50,116
You've been teaching guitar
to my neighbour's daughter for long?

119
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,702
No, tomorrow will be the first time.

120
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:59,542
You've always lived here,
or are you from somewhere else?

121
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,712
No, I've always lived here.
With my mother.

122
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:06,341
She died three weeks ago.
Three weeks only.

123
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,192
You had a look at her cleavage?

124
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,985
Ah... yes. Daring.

125
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:31,324
Plunging! You could count the hairs
on her pussy. Did you count?

126
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,952
- I didn't look that far down.
- Really?

127
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:38,206
Miss! There's a little fly
in the gentleman's drink.

128
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,468
- I don't see a fly.
- David, you swallowed the fly!

129
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,387
- Seventeen.
- That's all?

130
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,556
I didn't have much time.

131
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:02,689
Have you noticed how blondes' pussies
differ from those of brunettes?

132
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:06,109
Quite different. You can't see anything
with brunettes.

133
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:10,655
I'm a brunette, as I hope you've
noticed... You can't see anything.

134
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,199
It's hidden, buried away,
in the thick hair.

135
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,535
A brunette's pussy is mysterious.

136
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,289
And therefore, very exciting. No? Yes.

137
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:23,918
With blondes... Do you want me
to call the waitress back?

138
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,212
..you really get to see the pussy.

139
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:30,592
A blonde's covering is so fair,
so fine... It's transparent.

140
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,512
- Therefore, more immodest, no?
- Yes.

141
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:40,018
No. It's more innocent.
It reminds one of little girls' pussies.

142
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,438
- And a redhead's pussy?
- I've never seen one.

143
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,232
- But I'm still young!
- Me, too.

144
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:50,945
Where's my cane? There it is.
I've got to get home. Thank you.

145
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:32,213
Why do you stay with your husband?

146
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:35,925
Because I love him.

147
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,264
And him?

148
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,268
He loves me, too.

149
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,901
No.

150
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,781
No, maybe he hates me.

151
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,787
I don't know.
I don't know him very well.

152
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:10,251
- You hate him, too.
- I don't know.

153
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:16,466
You don't know yourself very well.

154
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,451
What does this drawing mean?

155
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,788
A magic sign.

156
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,791
It "bolsters" the pillow.
Do you get it?

157
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,960
Yes... Yes, I do.

158
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:01,970
I had a drink with your neighbour
this morning.

159
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,597
At her house?

160
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,766
No, in town.

161
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,937
And...?

162
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:13,732
She's a good talker.

163
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:15,900
That's all?

164
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:22,115
I wonder if she saw us say goodbye
in front of the shop...

165
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,746
Obviously she saw us.

166
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,627
You don't know me very well.

167
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,562
Hello, I'm just leaving.

168
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,939
I hope you will be pleased with Viviane.

169
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,358
I'll try to do my best.

170
00:21:56,483 --> 00:22:00,278
Before I go: my wife and l
would like you to come for dinner.

171
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,572
- Next Monday?
- Perfect.

172
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:06,451
Julia will tell you more.

173
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:10,705
I leave him to you.
See you later, Mr Aurphet.

174
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:19,923
Come. She's in her room.

175
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,470
- He loves you, it's obvious.
- I hate you.

176
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,433
Can I keep calling you "Mrs"?
It's more arousing.

177
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,019
I might not be free tomorrow.

178
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:36,022
See you later. Work hard.

179
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:42,320
I like your home. It feels
like one is elsewhere.

180
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:46,574
- Yes, but one really is here.
- That's its charm.

181
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:32,912
It's good. Perhaps the right hand
should be more... flexible.

182
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:38,084
Did my mother tell you
that I sleep with everyone?

183
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,880
- No, why would she?
- And if it were true?

184
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:45,383
That's no one's business but your own.

185
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,178
My mother likes you.
And when she likes someone...

186
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,014
That's no one's business but my own.

187
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:55,268
- Yes. Goodbye.
- Till Friday.

188
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,748
What a pleasant surprise.

189
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:20,293
You've bought some records?
Can I have a look?

190
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,802
I can tape a few records
for you if you want.

191
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:32,055
- Rare ones.
- I bought this, as well.

192
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,187
- Can l...
-..offer you a drink? I...

193
00:24:39,312 --> 00:24:41,106
..won't say no.

194
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,654
The street side... The Tombsthay side.

195
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:49,864
- Those are your photos?
- Guess.

196
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,866
- Yours.
- Or not.

197
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,326
- Some coffee?
- No.

198
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:56,788
I would. I'll bring you an orange juice.

199
00:24:56,913 --> 00:24:59,791
I'd prefer a cognac.

200
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,004
Put on a record, you choose.

201
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:09,718
Then go for a look around the house.
Back soon.

202
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:57,766
Know what I was thinking to myself?
I have a "nice backside", as they say,

203
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:02,187
"a cute arse", as they also say...
Mine's not too bad...

204
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:04,356
Can I touch it?

205
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,361
Excuse me?

206
00:26:14,783 --> 00:26:18,370
Do you think I'm a melon?
"Can I touch it?"

207
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:21,164
We're not at the Montelimar market,
my friend.

208
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:23,792
Cavaillon. Montelimar is for nougat.

209
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:27,504
- What's Cambrai, then?
- Near to Waterloo.

210
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:32,175
Exactly, the Berezina.
We'll say no more about it.

211
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:39,432
Did you know my esteemed neighbour
Graham Tombsthay is wooing me?

212
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:44,312
- That's not true.
- Quite right. In fact, it's not true.

213
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:52,570
How could it be possible,
I've only known him for two days.

214
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:55,990
Between us, in two days,
obviously not...

215
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:59,285
Sometimes I say pointless things
as well!

216
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,621
Could you turn that lamp on
over there?

217
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:12,966
If you want to go and look
out the window, do it!

218
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:17,095
The Tombsthay side...

219
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,351
The street side.

220
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:42,328
You like night-time? For you,
how does it differ from the day?

221
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:44,664
It's like... day and night!

222
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:48,543
- There are no children out at night.
- Or buses.

223
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:50,545
Do you know these lines:

224
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:54,341
"The time of day
when the children roam the streets...

225
00:27:54,466 --> 00:27:57,385
"The time of day when...
beautiful women run around."

226
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,388
- Yes, it's by me.
- Only half of it.

227
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:04,934
Do you know who that woman is?
A whore.

228
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,103
Do you like whores?

229
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:10,273
I saw her one night
behind the Prefecture,

230
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:13,234
in the shadow of a street light.

231
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,029
The street light was broken.

232
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:22,160
- And then?
- Oh, another time...

233
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:28,124
I... find you very elegant this evening.

234
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:33,004
Me, too. You're going to be late.

235
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:35,799
And my mother's waiting for me!

236
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:55,068
Put your hands flat. Your wallet?

237
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:57,237
In my back pocket.

238
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:33,189
- Are you hurt?
- No, just a clumsy kick.

239
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:37,402
- I can call a doctor.
- lt'll be all right.

240
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:40,363
Thanks for helping out.

241
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:44,117
That lout stole my wallet.

242
00:29:44,242 --> 00:29:46,119
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

243
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:49,247
- Can I offer you a drink?
- I'd like that.

244
00:29:49,372 --> 00:29:54,252
- I don't want to inconvenience you.
- Not at all.

245
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:58,506
- It doesn't hurt any more?
- It's gone.

246
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,762
One moment, I'll just go
put some water...

247
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:05,930
Let me have a look.

248
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:11,770
- He had powerful hands.
- Not too bad. You'll have a bruise.

249
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:16,399
Sit down.

250
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:28,119
- Will you file a report?
- I don't know. Maybe for my lD papers.

251
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:32,415
- Could you see the guy?
- Not very well. He wasn't young.

252
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,252
- Were you scared?
- Yes, a little.

253
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:45,762
I think I've seen you before.
Two days ago and yesterday, in a car.

254
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:48,640
- You have a grey Rover, don't you?
- Yes.

255
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:53,061
I've got a job here in the city
which leaves me a lot of free time.

256
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:56,523
If you weren't there,
he would have knocked me out.

257
00:30:56,648 --> 00:31:00,235
I don't think he would
have knocked you out.

258
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,490
If he'd wanted to, he'd have done it
straight away and then robbed you.

259
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:09,994
- But he...
- He was aiming for your hand, not head.

260
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,163
But why?

261
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:18,628
- You're a musician? A guitarist?
- Yes.

262
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:32,726
If he'd struck you with this,
he would have smashed your hand.

263
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:36,896
- You do it for a living?
- Yes. And the wallet...?

264
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,357
To lead you off the track.

265
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:42,277
Just imagine...

266
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:45,488
The first idea
that comes to mind...

267
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:48,199
- A jealous husband...
- I don't know any of those.

268
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:51,828
I said, just imagine.

269
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:56,249
- Can I ask your name?
- Daniel Forest. And yours?

270
00:31:57,125 --> 00:32:02,213
David Aurphet. You're very clever
in your deductions.

271
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:05,050
My professional training, I suppose.

272
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:09,387
- What do you do?
- You wouldn't believe me.

273
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:13,641
- You'll think I'm crazy.
- Tell me anyway.

274
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:16,853
My job is to get rid of people.

275
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,942
You... You're a killer?

276
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:27,155
An ugly word... but yes.

277
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,409
If it's true, I don't think you would
have told me. Not so quickly.

278
00:32:31,534 --> 00:32:36,039
You're mistaken. One makes this kind
of admission without thinking.

279
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:39,042
Because the desire to do so
is too strong.

280
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:51,429
And you have... a job to do
in this city?

281
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,139
Yes.

282
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:03,566
Excuse me. I felt
a sudden need to talk...

283
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:16,413
- You've killed before?
- Yes.

284
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:18,331
I'll leave you.

285
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:20,542
You're not worried that I'll report you?

286
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:25,422
I know when I can trust people.
I'm never wrong.

287
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:30,468
Be careful.

288
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:34,806
Here's my telephone number.
Feel free to call me.

289
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:39,686
Even for no reason...
I'd be pleased to see you again.

290
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:50,321
You're thinking that it's dangerous
to know a killer?

291
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:51,781
I assure you that it's not.

292
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:56,286
If you lie to me,
I'll rip your head off!

293
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,788
My downstairs neighbours.

294
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:01,332
- Goodbye. Thank you, again.
- You're welcome.

295
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:05,170
- See you again, maybe.
- Maybe.

296
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:10,068
I love you.

297
00:35:10,193 --> 00:35:14,572
My hands love you...
My legs love you...

298
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:17,701
My stomach loves you...
My mouth loves you...

299
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:22,956
My eyes love you...
We love you so much.

300
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:25,125
And you?

301
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:32,966
- I don't care much for myself...
- Come now!

302
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:35,343
..except when I love you.

303
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:34,277
- I was frightened!
- Of me?

304
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:39,657
I always hear it a little early...

305
00:36:44,162 --> 00:36:47,665
No, not at all. Tomorrow evening.

306
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,883
We'll do that. Eight o'clock. Till...

307
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:21,199
The man who saved you yesterday,

308
00:37:21,324 --> 00:37:24,369
- that was him on the phone?
- Yes.

309
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:26,830
He invited me to dinner tomorrow night.

310
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:30,458
- At his house?
- No.

311
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:38,258
You don't think it odd that he happened
to be there when you were attacked?

312
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:46,808
And would your husband be capable
of sending someone to smash my hand?

313
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:51,021
Yes. He can become quite violent.

314
00:37:51,813 --> 00:37:56,568
- But with you... No, I doubt it.
- Why?

315
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:59,821
- He would have told me.
- Are you sure?

316
00:37:59,946 --> 00:38:03,408
No, not totally.
I'm getting old, it's a drama.

317
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:07,037
Not a tragedy, a drama.

318
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,083
See you.

319
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:51,247
I won't be home later.
Be good with Viviane.

320
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:54,125
- She's a beautiful girl.
- Very.

321
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,211
- Very good?
- Very beautiful.

322
00:39:03,635 --> 00:39:07,347
I'm going to the country with friends.
I'll miss Monday's lesson.

323
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,933
That works out well, I'll be moving.

324
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:13,144
- Can I ask you something?
- Of course.

325
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:20,735
I'd like to film your fingers
while you play.

326
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,697
So I can study the position
of the fingers.

327
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,584
- Goodbye.
- Is it nice, where you live?

328
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,170
Yes. A house in the trees.

329
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:41,881
- You'll be living alone?
- Yes.

330
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,050
Goodbye.

331
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:17,667
I didn't want to leave.
Am I disturbing you?

332
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:20,670
No, I've almost finished.

333
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:27,427
A friend is coming to pick me up,
but a bit later.

334
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:32,057
- My piece?
- Yes.

335
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,434
Want some coffee?
I was just making some.

336
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,103
No, thank you.

337
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:42,776
A piece of Gruyere, some plum brandy...?
That's right, I've got no more...

338
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:47,614
A frozen mushroom, ham
and cheese pancake?

339
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,783
No, nothing at all, thank you.

340
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,084
Does the stove work?

341
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:04,297
No. That's the reason I'm moving.

342
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:09,886
You have a pretty ring.

343
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:13,682
Yes. It came from my mother.

344
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:31,491
- Do you know this house?
- No.

345
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:39,040
Could you call me a taxi?

346
00:41:39,165 --> 00:41:40,792
Thank you.

347
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:52,846
One of my pupils.
Why did I tell you that?

348
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:56,516
Yes, why did you tell me that?
Shall we go?

349
00:41:56,641 --> 00:41:58,685
I have to change first.

350
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:02,897
It's Saturday, the restaurants
will be full. We'll go to my place.

351
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:06,735
- That's not a problem?
- No.

352
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,320
Nice furnished apartment you have.

353
00:42:36,097 --> 00:42:37,807
SOLD TO G. TOMBSTHAY
80,000 F

354
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:42,520
Your pupil, the one before.
I think I've seen her before.

355
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:44,356
- I wonder...
- No need to wonder.

356
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:47,192
I was when you were walking
in her neighbourhood.

357
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:50,195
Don't think I've been
up to anything with her,

358
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,990
and that her father sent a hand-smasher
so I could no longer teach her.

359
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:57,452
I'm not thinking anything.
It's you doing the thinking...

360
00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:10,674
Why did you smile a few days ago
when you looked at my neck?

361
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:14,844
Smile? I don't remember...

362
00:43:14,969 --> 00:43:19,349
Ah, yes! But I shouldn't...

363
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:22,394
I told you that you'd have a bruise.

364
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:27,273
Getting a bruise from a bruiser.
You don't think that's funny?

365
00:43:27,399 --> 00:43:29,442
Yes, it is.

366
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,253
It's good to laugh a bit.

367
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:52,507
- Why? Your job isn't fun?
- Sometimes.

368
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:56,094
- Does it take long... a contract?
- Yes.

369
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:01,641
I don't gun people down on the street
two hours after receiving the order.

370
00:44:01,766 --> 00:44:04,436
I'm... meticulous.

371
00:44:06,479 --> 00:44:08,815
And expensive.

372
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,736
- You're pulling my leg.
- I promise you, I'm not.

373
00:44:17,115 --> 00:44:19,367
What do you have to do here, exactly?

374
00:44:19,492 --> 00:44:21,828
Kill a man and steal an item from him.

375
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:24,330
An item.

376
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:27,375
- In which is hidden...
-..microfilm, no doubt!

377
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,336
Yes.

378
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:34,799
If you don't believe me,
stop asking questions.

379
00:44:44,934 --> 00:44:47,979
It's true, this is like
an interrogation.

380
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:53,693
What was the guy like?
Normal? Suspicious? Sinister?

381
00:44:53,818 --> 00:44:56,905
No, not sinister. OK, he had...

382
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:03,119
A head like a spoon?
Like a small spoon?

383
00:45:03,244 --> 00:45:07,791
Or like a big spoon?
Or was his head always shaded?

384
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:13,630
OK, a... shady... Iook, very well,

385
00:45:13,755 --> 00:45:17,884
but not si... nis... ter.

386
00:45:22,681 --> 00:45:24,599
So what's on these microfilms?

387
00:45:24,724 --> 00:45:27,811
I don't know, and I don't want to know.

388
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:33,775
Sometimes diplomatic secrets,

389
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:38,029
sometimes scientific secrets,
or industrial secrets.

390
00:45:38,154 --> 00:45:41,241
In this case, probably industrial.

391
00:45:43,535 --> 00:45:46,621
I don't know what to think of you.

392
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:50,959
Don't think anything.

393
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,966
It doesn't affect you, killing people?

394
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:00,969
Do you really want to discuss it?

395
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,557
How did it begin?

396
00:46:05,682 --> 00:46:08,184
Very simply.

397
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:11,104
You meet someone who knows someone.

398
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:14,607
That lasts for two years, and after that
you meet someone

399
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:17,485
who suggests introducing you
to someone

400
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:21,197
who could offer you
something interesting.

401
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:25,035
- How old are you?
- Forty.

402
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:32,751
- You've never been married?
- Never. And you?

403
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:41,092
Thank you.

404
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:45,722
Good luck with the move.
Call me if you want, I'd like that.

405
00:47:41,027 --> 00:47:44,739
- Hello? Edwige Ledieu?
- Here I am.

406
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:49,661
- Thanks for letting me come so soon.
- What's that, a porno?

407
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:51,746
I don't know. An anonymous gift...

408
00:47:57,127 --> 00:48:01,214
Push this button here.
I'll leave you.

409
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:55,995
- I received...
- Me, too.

410
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:57,747
I've been trying to call you.

411
00:49:57,872 --> 00:50:00,542
- Is it your husband?
- I don't know.

412
00:50:00,625 --> 00:50:02,585
I'm calling from your neighbour's.

413
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:05,672
- Are you having a change of heart?
- No.

414
00:50:05,797 --> 00:50:07,799
- Are you alone?
- Yes.

415
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:11,011
Can you come out onto the terrace?

416
00:50:21,062 --> 00:50:23,898
Your dinner tonight, should I come,
or find an excuse?

417
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:26,192
- You must come!
- Are you enjoying this?

418
00:50:26,317 --> 00:50:28,111
- And you?
- No.

419
00:50:28,236 --> 00:50:32,115
- Did my neighbour watch the video tape?
- No. You'd like her to see you...

420
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:36,995
..naked, making love to you? I'd have
liked that. See you this evening!

421
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:43,543
Can I come back in? I'm waiting...

422
00:50:43,668 --> 00:50:47,422
Me too. Don't forget the drinks,
I'm thirsty.

423
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:53,261
- So then, the video tape?
- I imagine you heard everything.

424
00:50:53,386 --> 00:50:56,806
Not at all, I heard a click
and thought that you'd hung up.

425
00:50:56,931 --> 00:51:00,643
It was the other one,
but don't tell me who it was!

426
00:51:05,398 --> 00:51:08,485
Come on, don't sulk, tell me the story.

427
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:12,655
- It was indeed a porno.
- Will you show me?

428
00:51:12,781 --> 00:51:16,368
Someone took it upon themselves
to film my... most private life.

429
00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:21,498
- You, by yourself?
- No, there was someone else.

430
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:26,044
Let me guess. A married woman?

431
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:29,255
- Yes.
- The old story.

432
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:34,052
- Either it's the husband...
-..or it's not the husband.

433
00:51:34,177 --> 00:51:36,930
No, I mean, some headcase.
They do exist!

434
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:39,182
I even met one recently...

435
00:51:39,307 --> 00:51:41,559
Bring him over here!

436
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:45,313
Or else... it's you.

437
00:51:47,399 --> 00:51:50,485
No, excuse me, l...

438
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,324
No need to excuse yourself, it is me.

439
00:51:56,449 --> 00:51:58,493
I like to have fun.

440
00:51:59,869 --> 00:52:01,371
- Are you serious?
- Are you?

441
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:04,582
- I don't know.
- Nor do l, then.

442
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:11,089
- Speaking of tapes, you promised...
- Sorry.

443
00:52:11,214 --> 00:52:13,883
You haven't had the time?

444
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:18,430
No. I think that... I'm a little drunk.

445
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:20,765
And a little crazy.

446
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:24,811
But I don't care. Now go.

447
00:53:42,514 --> 00:53:45,767
I'm just here for the lesson.
I'm moving in with some friends.

448
00:53:45,892 --> 00:53:50,313
- You'll be able to go there?
- Yes.

449
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:52,816
Don't worry, my parents
will keep paying you.

450
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:54,901
I'm not worried at all.

451
00:53:55,026 --> 00:53:58,530
- I'm sorry. Are you mad at me?
- No.

452
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:07,997
And if I don't join you tonight,
you won't be mad?

453
00:54:08,123 --> 00:54:10,166
No.

454
00:54:24,639 --> 00:54:28,184
A great car, but the fifth gear
seems a bit far away.

455
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:32,188
A bit far, yes. You've got to get
on all fours on the passenger side,

456
00:54:32,313 --> 00:54:36,443
dust yourself off, take your seat again
and thank God if there's no bend.

457
00:54:38,945 --> 00:54:40,572
Excuse me.

458
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:46,286
I think he likes you very much.

459
00:54:46,411 --> 00:54:48,872
Come through here, it's better.

460
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:07,891
It doesn't seem like
he's received the tape.

461
00:55:08,016 --> 00:55:11,311
Don't trust the way he looks.

462
00:55:14,189 --> 00:55:17,734
I hope you will agree to play
something for us.

463
00:55:17,859 --> 00:55:20,528
Sorry, I didn't bring my guitar,

464
00:55:20,612 --> 00:55:23,198
and I think that Viviane took hers.

465
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:25,784
By the way, did you see,
she brought out the VCR.

466
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:30,038
We gave her a VCR and a video camera.
They amused her for a week...

467
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:53,812
Have you seen
what beautiful hands he has?

468
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:56,439
You have to watch out
for your hands with your job?

469
00:55:56,564 --> 00:56:00,026
Yes, one imagines things...

470
00:56:08,618 --> 00:56:12,330
At least a guitar is less dangerous
than a car or motorbike!

471
00:56:13,748 --> 00:56:18,253
By the way... I keep on saying
"by the way" this evening!

472
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:21,756
I had an accident today,
a very minor one.

473
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:26,386
I had stopped at the lights,
and someone ran into me from behind.

474
00:56:26,511 --> 00:56:29,180
The guy, or should I say road hog,

475
00:56:29,264 --> 00:56:32,976
clearly under the influence
of a few drinks, got out,

476
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:37,230
went to the back of his own car
and called out to me,

477
00:56:37,355 --> 00:56:40,025
"It's all right, there's no damage!"

478
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:50,785
You should be careful, my darling...

479
00:56:52,328 --> 00:56:54,581
You've had a tiring day.

480
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:59,753
Look how much David resembles
your younger brother.

481
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,395
Excuse us.

482
00:57:18,646 --> 00:57:22,692
What were we talking about?
Oh, yes, accidents...

483
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:04,526
Thanks for coming here so late.

484
00:58:04,651 --> 00:58:07,779
I've looked around the house,
I didn't see anything.

485
00:58:07,904 --> 00:58:10,573
I didn't hear you.

486
00:58:12,992 --> 00:58:16,705
- You don't look too good.
- I drank too much today.

487
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:21,876
OK, I'll ask you the question again:

488
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:25,714
does anyone have any reason
to hold a grudge against you?

489
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:34,806
Tell me everything. From the beginning.

490
00:58:34,931 --> 00:58:38,935
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes, with lots of sugar.

491
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:42,856
Is there any more?

492
00:58:45,525 --> 00:58:48,486
Stories about jealous husbands
are commonplace,

493
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:50,864
but they can be dangerous.

494
00:58:50,989 --> 00:58:53,783
Don't forget, people are crazy.

495
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:56,619
Sorry to have bothered you,
but I panicked.

496
00:58:56,745 --> 00:58:59,998
I'm afraid. In this house
which doesn't lock, or so badly...

497
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:05,670
- I can stay here tonight.
- Yes? You don't mind?

498
00:59:05,795 --> 00:59:09,924
Not at all.
I was just thinking about it.

499
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:16,681
It would be best if you didn't see
that woman for the next few days.

500
00:59:16,806 --> 00:59:21,978
Or her daughter, or anybody.
You, if need be...

501
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:29,736
- Do you still go walking in the park?
- Yes, I went yesterday. Why?

502
00:59:29,861 --> 00:59:32,739
This Mrs Tombsthay, could she have...

503
00:59:32,864 --> 00:59:34,699
- The attack?
- For instance...

504
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:37,911
The video?
Naturally I'd thought about it

505
00:59:40,705 --> 00:59:45,251
I think she fell into your arms
a bit too quickly.

506
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:47,879
I think that you're under my feet
a bit too much.

507
00:59:48,004 --> 00:59:51,091
Really? You think that?

508
00:59:59,265 --> 01:00:00,892
I'm sorry.

509
01:00:02,727 --> 01:00:06,523
I've already made a fool of myself today
with the Tombsthay's neighbour.

510
01:00:06,648 --> 01:00:09,484
I straight out asked her
if she sent the tape.

511
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:13,446
- What did she say?
- She said she had.

512
01:00:13,571 --> 01:00:15,407
Do you feel unwell?

513
01:00:19,577 --> 01:00:22,872
Sorry. This happens
every now and then.

514
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:27,168
When I arrived in this city,

515
01:00:27,293 --> 01:00:31,506
I remember thinking
that I would die here.

516
01:00:31,631 --> 01:00:34,509
What does that feel like?

517
01:00:35,427 --> 01:00:37,887
It depends. It changes...

518
01:00:40,056 --> 01:00:43,143
I don't have any pyjamas to lend you.

519
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:47,647
It doesn't matter.

520
01:00:58,575 --> 01:01:00,618
Good night.

521
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:17,177
- How are you?
- Fine. Have you seen this wind?

522
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:20,430
- You know what woke me?
- The wind!

523
01:01:20,555 --> 01:01:25,769
No, the smell of the toast.
It's like the smell of coffee.

524
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:30,231
- Perhaps it was the smell of coffee.
- No, the coffee smell doesn't wake me.

525
01:01:31,733 --> 01:01:33,902
Have you sorted out your lD papers?

526
01:01:34,027 --> 01:01:38,406
No, not yet. It's nice
not being anyone.

527
01:01:38,531 --> 01:01:41,451
- It would be better to be someone else.
- Who?

528
01:01:41,576 --> 01:01:44,454
- And how?
- And why?

529
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:49,459
I suppose you often change.
Change identities, I mean.

530
01:01:49,584 --> 01:01:52,253
Sometimes.

531
01:01:52,337 --> 01:01:54,464
The police!

532
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,138
- I came...
- Blew in!

533
01:02:02,263 --> 01:02:05,392
..to see your house, and invite you
to come over this evening!

534
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:08,228
No, no more meals at your house!

535
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:11,439
Graham is going away
for three days this afternoon.

536
01:02:12,649 --> 01:02:16,236
Did you know my dear husband
had a boyfriend some years ago?

537
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:19,531
More than one, perhaps...

538
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:23,868
It smells nice here.
Will you show me around?

539
01:02:23,993 --> 01:02:26,454
Would you like a tour?

540
01:02:28,331 --> 01:02:31,543
No, since you're busy.

541
01:02:35,505 --> 01:02:37,549
Will you come?

542
01:02:40,427 --> 01:02:43,805
Is that all the effect I have on you?

543
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:47,017
You pulse hasn't quickened at all!

544
01:02:47,642 --> 01:02:50,562
You know I'm more of a night person...

545
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:53,440
- See you tonight.
- Not at your place, I don't like it.

546
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:57,527
But we must. It's much
more interesting at my place.

547
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:13,126
David, I'm off, but before I leave,
let me say something:

548
01:03:13,251 --> 01:03:15,295
beware of Graham Tombsthay.

549
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:18,548
- He's about to go on a trip.
- That doesn't change anything.

550
01:03:18,673 --> 01:03:22,761
Believe me, you should stop
seeing that woman for a while.

551
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:26,639
Daniel, thanks for everything.
You've been very kind...

552
01:03:26,765 --> 01:03:29,726
Graham Tombsthay is the man
I have to eliminate.

553
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:32,437
- And then steal...
- Steal what?

554
01:03:32,562 --> 01:03:37,317
- What is this microfilm thing?
- A small antique globe.

555
01:03:37,442 --> 01:03:40,945
- You're going to kill him?
- Yes.

556
01:03:49,704 --> 01:03:51,539
- What...
-..an embarrassing...

557
01:03:51,664 --> 01:03:54,751
-..situation.
- Yes.

558
01:03:56,461 --> 01:04:00,507
If you're uneasy,
come and stay at my place tonight.

559
01:04:00,632 --> 01:04:05,804
You know, the people to be eliminated
are often dangerous.

560
01:04:07,555 --> 01:04:11,267
I'm seeing Julia Tombsthay tonight.
At her place.

561
01:04:13,853 --> 01:04:16,314
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

562
01:04:19,067 --> 01:04:23,738
I brought a gun last night, just
in case. I'll leave it, if you want.

563
01:04:23,863 --> 01:04:27,409
It's small and ugly,
but efficient and silent.

564
01:04:27,534 --> 01:04:31,413
It will do much better
than a kitchen knife.

565
01:04:31,538 --> 01:04:34,249
It's loaded. That's the safety catch.

566
01:04:34,374 --> 01:04:39,504
- OK, thanks. What about you?
- I have another one. Much larger.

567
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:49,848
- Hello?
- It's me.

568
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:51,891
- Hi, Dad.
- It's ready.

569
01:04:52,017 --> 01:04:55,020
- What's ready?
- It's a surprise. Hurry over.

570
01:04:55,145 --> 01:04:57,480
OK, then, I'm coming over.

571
01:05:02,485 --> 01:05:04,988
- So, then?
- You took your time.

572
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:07,824
Come on, let's go down to the cellar.

573
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:11,828
Here it is. I've finished.
It's wonderful.

574
01:05:11,953 --> 01:05:16,624
- What's it good for?
- Nothing. But it proves I could do it.

575
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,711
So the company was wrong to fire me.

576
01:05:19,836 --> 01:05:23,340
Hooray! You'll be the first
to win a prize for early retirement!

577
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:28,094
Look, it's so simple.
You set the timer on the dial,

578
01:05:28,219 --> 01:05:33,183
one minute, five minutes,
press here and goodbye!

579
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:38,188
Imagine, if you were to set this off
under a horse, for example,

580
01:05:38,313 --> 01:05:39,773
there'd be no more horse.

581
01:05:39,898 --> 01:05:43,151
The teeth, hooves, horns...
Wait, horses don't have horns...

582
01:05:43,276 --> 01:05:46,696
The skin, the bones... all gone.
Pulverised.

583
01:05:46,821 --> 01:05:49,949
A thimble full of ash.

584
01:05:50,075 --> 01:05:53,661
If I gave that to you, would you ask me:
"ls that a horse?"

585
01:05:53,787 --> 01:05:57,332
No, but what did the horse do to you?

586
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:32,969
Viviane shouldn't be long.

587
01:07:33,094 --> 01:07:36,723
Not only does she have the cheek
to disturb you outside of the lessons,

588
01:07:36,848 --> 01:07:40,435
- but on top of that, she's late!
- It doesn't really matter.

589
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,645
What a day! I was supposed
to catch a plane

590
01:07:42,771 --> 01:07:47,942
but at the last minute it was cancelled.
Some minor technical fault. Come in.

591
01:08:18,807 --> 01:08:20,225
Where is Julia?

592
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:23,603
Mrs Tombsthay is in her room,
or elsewhere. Who knows?

593
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:27,107
She's so strange, and lies so well.

594
01:08:27,232 --> 01:08:32,696
You as well, let it be said in passing.
But it's time for me to end this game.

595
01:08:32,821 --> 01:08:36,449
Again, in passing, I congratulate you
on your acting skill!

596
01:08:36,574 --> 01:08:41,705
Although now, cameras run on batteries.

597
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:45,500
- Before, they were spring-loaded.
- Quite right!

598
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:47,168
Did you think, my pretty sir,

599
01:08:47,293 --> 01:08:50,213
that I'd let you fuck my wife
with impunity?

600
01:08:50,338 --> 01:08:53,008
On your knees. On your knees!

601
01:08:54,634 --> 01:08:59,597
I'm going to kill you, my handsome.
If you only knew how much I'll enjoy it!

602
01:09:00,223 --> 01:09:03,852
It's all been worked out.
Failed robbery, attack, self-defence.

603
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:08,023
If need be, a "crime of passion".
Are you afraid?

604
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:14,154
I bid you farewell, seducer!

605
01:09:15,613 --> 01:09:20,035
Someone is going to kill you!
Steal your globe and kill you!

606
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:25,874
Well done! You've won a moment's
reprieve. Tell me what you mean...

607
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,809
- What's going on?
- I've killed Graham...

608
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:27,602
What?

609
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,564
Two bullets...

610
01:10:57,340 --> 01:10:59,426
You'd better get rid of this.

611
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:03,680
Or return it to your friend.
It's his, isn't it?

612
01:11:05,974 --> 01:11:10,145
Don't touch anything! Come with me.
I'm calling the police.

613
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:13,356
But first, we've got to make it look
like a robbery...

614
01:11:35,170 --> 01:11:37,213
You like it?

615
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:43,678
Take it, I'll say it was stolen.

616
01:11:43,803 --> 01:11:46,639
- It's beautiful. It must be expensive.
- lndeed.

617
01:11:46,765 --> 01:11:49,726
It's exactly what would be stolen.

618
01:11:49,851 --> 01:11:51,728
Do you know its true value?

619
01:11:51,853 --> 01:11:56,608
Better than you think.
It meant a lot to Graham.

620
01:11:56,733 --> 01:11:59,527
You're not able to?

621
01:12:00,278 --> 01:12:02,864
Now, leave.

622
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:05,450
I suddenly feel so good!

623
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:09,662
You wouldn't understand.

624
01:12:20,215 --> 01:12:23,009
We can't meet for a while.
It's too dangerous.

625
01:12:23,134 --> 01:12:26,554
We mustn't call each other, either.

626
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,973
But how will I know about you?

627
01:12:29,099 --> 01:12:32,268
If you don't hear anything,
everything's fine. If not...

628
01:12:32,394 --> 01:12:36,106
I'll find a way of warning you.
Come on, go!

629
01:12:37,315 --> 01:12:40,193
And take care of yourself.

630
01:13:31,327 --> 01:13:35,081
Come in! Good morning! I'm coming!

631
01:13:44,257 --> 01:13:46,301
That's how it is. My eyes hurt today.

632
01:13:48,803 --> 01:13:51,890
That said, don't take anything
I say too seriously!

633
01:13:52,849 --> 01:13:55,727
I found it! It was in the kitchen.

634
01:13:55,935 --> 01:13:59,773
You look rather strange.
Is something wrong?

635
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:04,194
My neighbour's death? Did you hear?
But of course, you knew him.

636
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:06,446
There's not enough salt.

637
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:10,867
Such a to-do since this morning!
The police questioned me.

638
01:14:10,992 --> 01:14:13,703
I saw nothing! I dined out
and got home at three.

639
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:30,261
I knew you'd be interested.
That's why I called you,

640
01:14:30,387 --> 01:14:33,056
not just to thank you for the tapes.

641
01:14:33,181 --> 01:14:35,850
I also wanted to show you
my recent photos...

642
01:14:35,934 --> 01:14:39,312
Nothing amazing, but I like them.

643
01:14:39,437 --> 01:14:41,606
It's only a selection, of course.

644
01:14:41,731 --> 01:14:45,568
What I like in this one is that
Mrs Tombsthay seems different.

645
01:14:45,694 --> 01:14:49,531
You might say lost, distraught.
It suits her.

646
01:14:49,656 --> 01:14:52,534
It makes you want to take her
in your arms, no?

647
01:14:52,659 --> 01:14:56,496
And look, her husband.
I didn't really like him much.

648
01:14:56,621 --> 01:15:01,251
He seems happy. But you can't see
what he's looking at.

649
01:15:01,376 --> 01:15:04,379
A snake, perhaps, or his daughter...

650
01:15:04,504 --> 01:15:06,548
No, it wasn't the same day.

651
01:15:06,673 --> 01:15:10,218
Viviane, isn't it?
The name doesn't suit her.

652
01:15:10,343 --> 01:15:13,513
But then again, I'm called Edwige...

653
01:15:14,806 --> 01:15:17,600
The teacher and his pupil.

654
01:15:17,726 --> 01:15:21,021
Did you know that whenever you go
in or out of my neighbours',

655
01:15:21,146 --> 01:15:24,983
you always glance in my direction?
It's very flattering.

656
01:15:25,108 --> 01:15:28,486
The girl has regained
her airs and graces.

657
01:15:28,611 --> 01:15:32,449
What was I saying?
But you never saw me.

658
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:35,702
Am I mistaken? No, I'm not mistaken.

659
01:15:35,827 --> 01:15:39,998
That's the most recent. One hesitates,
wonders... but doesn't ring.

660
01:15:40,123 --> 01:15:43,293
You did the right thing, I wouldn't
have answered. I was busy.

661
01:15:43,418 --> 01:15:45,670
Finally this one,
taken from further away.

662
01:15:45,795 --> 01:15:49,090
I kept it because it's the first photo
I took of you.

663
01:15:49,215 --> 01:15:51,509
A moment later you led me
to that sordid bar

664
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:55,055
with that hussy of a waitress.
I was so embarrassed.

665
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:58,767
That's it. I hope you've had
a pleasant time.

666
01:15:58,892 --> 01:16:01,603
We'll keep the sound of your voice
for next time.

667
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:36,012
You were right to warn me.
Have you seen the newspapers?

668
01:16:38,682 --> 01:16:39,891
Come.

669
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:50,902
Do you know who we suspect?
Tombsthay's wife.

670
01:16:51,027 --> 01:16:54,823
And you can bet the globe's gone.

671
01:16:54,948 --> 01:16:57,283
You came here to tell me that?

672
01:16:57,409 --> 01:17:00,078
I'm afraid for you,
and I want to help you.

673
01:17:00,203 --> 01:17:03,540
It makes no sense! If Julia wanted
to kill him, why invite me over?

674
01:17:03,665 --> 01:17:07,794
How would you know? Perhaps you're part
of the plan without knowing.

675
01:17:10,672 --> 01:17:12,716
Piss off. Leave me alone.

676
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:18,179
I was afraid for you.

677
01:17:23,935 --> 01:17:26,521
What did you do with my pistol?

678
01:17:26,646 --> 01:17:31,109
I hid it in the power
meter cupboard. Bye.

679
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:35,822
Bye. It was a pleasure knowing you.

680
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:13,610
- What's happening?
- Viviane's been kidnapped.

681
01:18:14,611 --> 01:18:17,572
You know what ransom they're asking for?

682
01:18:17,697 --> 01:18:20,283
The globe.

683
01:18:20,408 --> 01:18:22,452
How did you guess?

684
01:18:22,577 --> 01:18:25,455
You kept insisting that I take it...

685
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:29,501
I seem to recall you
being very interested in it.

686
01:18:29,584 --> 01:18:32,754
- Was it a man who called you?
- Yes.

687
01:18:32,879 --> 01:18:35,590
What was his voice like?

688
01:18:35,715 --> 01:18:38,093
Like yours.

689
01:18:38,218 --> 01:18:40,762
You seem to be keeping
bad company at the moment.

690
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:43,223
Yes.

691
01:18:46,518 --> 01:18:47,727
Go away.

692
01:18:52,565 --> 01:18:56,277
Go home. I'll go and get the globe.

693
01:19:06,579 --> 01:19:09,040
Don't worry, she's alive.

694
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:20,260
- Seducing minors, now...
- Yes, that's it.

695
01:19:22,971 --> 01:19:25,223
We can't leave her there.

696
01:19:31,521 --> 01:19:35,358
I'll explain first. Then your sarcasm.
But I'll leave before that.

697
01:19:35,483 --> 01:19:37,986
You bore me, David.

698
01:19:50,498 --> 01:19:56,087
So there it is. I took her,
and I brought her back. Nice of me.

699
01:19:57,005 --> 01:20:03,178
This is just a sample
of the pressure I can exert.

700
01:20:03,303 --> 01:20:06,306
You're not the strong ones,
Mrs Tombsthay and you.

701
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:09,267
Do you believe me?

702
01:20:09,392 --> 01:20:13,605
- What happened?
- Don't worry, it's all over now.

703
01:20:13,730 --> 01:20:16,649
He's a friend.

704
01:20:16,775 --> 01:20:20,820
We're at my new place. Stay there.

705
01:20:20,945 --> 01:20:24,324
I'll see my friend to the door,
then I'll be back.

706
01:20:26,701 --> 01:20:31,748
- Do you know the word "picaresque"?
- You think I'm illiterate, too?

707
01:20:31,873 --> 01:20:34,250
You're the one
who's been telling stories!

708
01:20:34,376 --> 01:20:38,630
The night your mistress's husband was
killed, you were there. I followed you

709
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:43,426
because I was uneasy... about you.

710
01:20:43,551 --> 01:20:49,349
Mrs Tombsthay is cunning. A break-in?
I saw it all from the park.

711
01:20:49,474 --> 01:20:51,434
Why wait till now to tell me this?

712
01:20:51,559 --> 01:20:55,271
Because I wanted you
to be the one to tell me first!

713
01:20:57,107 --> 01:21:00,151
- Fine, then. I killed him.
- Unbelievable!

714
01:21:00,276 --> 01:21:02,487
You're still trying to defend her!

715
01:21:02,612 --> 01:21:05,448
I saw her kill her husband.

716
01:21:05,573 --> 01:21:08,743
On the terrace,
in front of the French windows.

717
01:21:08,868 --> 01:21:11,329
Are you going to try and deny it?

718
01:21:11,454 --> 01:21:13,957
All over again! You're crazy. Piss off!

719
01:21:14,082 --> 01:21:17,043
You make me sick.

720
01:21:17,168 --> 01:21:19,754
I don't know exactly
what you two are up to,

721
01:21:19,879 --> 01:21:22,257
but I'm certain
that you have the globe.

722
01:21:22,382 --> 01:21:24,884
Do you know the orders
I got this morning?

723
01:21:25,010 --> 01:21:30,098
To retrieve it, at any cost.
And eliminate the person who stole it.

724
01:21:30,223 --> 01:21:33,184
You cheated me. You make me sick.

725
01:21:33,309 --> 01:21:36,146
You've already said that.

726
01:21:36,271 --> 01:21:41,443
Come on, admit that it's you
that has it, David. Admit it!

727
01:21:42,944 --> 01:21:46,031
Yes, I have it.

728
01:21:46,948 --> 01:21:50,076
In that case, you now know
what I have to do.

729
01:21:50,201 --> 01:21:53,288
I warned you. I'm sorry.

730
01:21:59,919 --> 01:22:02,589
It's you who makes me sick!

731
01:22:07,927 --> 01:22:10,347
- Do you feel better?
- I'm OK.

732
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:14,809
- Is your friend in trouble?
- Yes, he couldn't find his car keys.

733
01:22:15,226 --> 01:22:18,104
- Shall I take you home?
- Yes, please.

734
01:22:18,229 --> 01:22:21,232
- To your parents' place?
- No, to my friends'.

735
01:22:26,112 --> 01:22:28,156
Thank you for everything.

736
01:22:31,284 --> 01:22:36,748
- Did my parents hurt you?
- Yes, I believe so.

737
01:22:36,873 --> 01:22:40,585
They enjoy that.
At least, they did.

738
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:43,797
- I tried to warn you...
- And I told you it was my business.

739
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,677
You know...

740
01:22:51,429 --> 01:22:54,516
I'm not very pleased
with myself, either.

741
01:23:13,868 --> 01:23:16,663
- Yes?
- It's Julia. Did you receive...?

742
01:23:16,788 --> 01:23:21,126
- Just now. Have you seen it?
- Yes.

743
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:25,547
- Can I be recognised?
- By someone who knows you, yes.

744
01:23:25,672 --> 01:23:29,592
- Was it filmed from your neighbour's?
- Maybe. I can't tell.

745
01:23:31,177 --> 01:23:36,141
- I must hang up, I have a visitor.
- Take care of yourself.

746
01:24:13,178 --> 01:24:17,307
- Where were you?
- Around the house.

747
01:24:19,476 --> 01:24:21,519
It's a large place.

748
01:24:36,576 --> 01:24:40,705
- Why? What do you want?
- The globe.

749
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:43,166
It's buried in the garden
with your pistol.

750
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:48,254
I thought it was in the power meter
cupboard. You've lied non-stop to me.

751
01:24:52,342 --> 01:24:55,553
Take it and piss off.
And please, put that away.

752
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:58,765
You don't understand, David.
I have to kill you.

753
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:05,397
I said the deal would be finished
today, and it will be.

754
01:25:06,981 --> 01:25:10,735
Stop it, Daniel. Think!
What are you going to do?

755
01:25:10,860 --> 01:25:16,449
I'll take a holiday,
like I always do after a job.

756
01:25:16,574 --> 01:25:19,244
I will send the globe to Felix Andre.

757
01:25:19,327 --> 01:25:25,041
Felix, that's his first name.
Poste restante, rue Turgot, Paris 9.

758
01:25:25,166 --> 01:25:29,170
Soon after, I will receive
my pay here, in the same way.

759
01:25:29,295 --> 01:25:32,590
PO Box 51 at the central post office.

760
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:37,470
Mr Dominique Lenaour,
that's my name in this city,

761
01:25:37,595 --> 01:25:42,809
will receive 300,000 francs,
and he'll never be heard from again.

762
01:25:42,934 --> 01:25:47,230
Despite what you believe,
the most important exchanges,

763
01:25:47,355 --> 01:25:52,235
and the most dangerous,
take place simply by post.

764
01:25:52,736 --> 01:25:56,156
I didn't take the microfilms.
Won't you check?

765
01:25:56,281 --> 01:26:01,453
No, I told you, I always know
when someone lies.

766
01:26:02,328 --> 01:26:04,664
At least, almost always...

767
01:26:05,665 --> 01:26:08,335
If you had believed me...

768
01:26:08,418 --> 01:26:12,088
Did Julia lie to me?

769
01:26:13,256 --> 01:26:17,761
I don't know her. But without her,
we wouldn't be here like this.

770
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:19,929
I'm sorry, David,

771
01:26:21,306 --> 01:26:23,350
but there's nothing else I can do...

772
01:26:26,811 --> 01:26:28,396
Goodbye, David.

773
01:27:26,329 --> 01:27:28,790
GOOD LUCK DAVlD

774
01:28:39,486 --> 01:28:41,529
I received another tape.
So did Mrs Tombsthay.

775
01:28:41,821 --> 01:28:44,616
Filmed from your place, wasn't it?

776
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:46,493
I don't like your tone.

777
01:28:46,618 --> 01:28:49,454
How does your story
about the whore end?

778
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:52,665
What whore? I don't know any whores.

779
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:57,128
- The tape, it was you?
- Yes.

780
01:28:57,253 --> 01:28:59,255
- The first time, as well?
- No.

781
01:28:59,381 --> 01:29:03,176
- I know.
- It was you who gave me the idea.

782
01:29:04,344 --> 01:29:07,764
Do killers make you... No.

783
01:29:07,889 --> 01:29:11,393
Excuse me, I was going to say...
I'll try again.

784
01:29:11,518 --> 01:29:15,647
Killers... Sorry, I'll start again.

785
01:29:15,855 --> 01:29:19,567
- Do you like killers?
- Do you?

786
01:29:20,443 --> 01:29:23,113
Have you watched your tape?

787
01:29:23,196 --> 01:29:25,490
I haven't. Mrs Tombsthay has.

788
01:29:25,615 --> 01:29:28,576
You can call her Julia.
Did she tell you about it?

789
01:29:28,702 --> 01:29:32,330
No, I already know what happens.

790
01:29:32,455 --> 01:29:34,374
- You think?
- Please, no!

791
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:38,628
Please, allow me this pleasure!

792
01:29:42,048 --> 01:29:45,218
You recognise yourself,
Mr Aurphet? Even filmed by me?

793
01:29:45,343 --> 01:29:49,055
From far away,
and at night-time. Not easy!

794
01:29:50,348 --> 01:29:54,686
Impossible to mistake him,
it's Mr Tombsthay.

795
01:29:54,811 --> 01:29:58,106
I never heard the gunshot
with all that wind.

796
01:29:58,231 --> 01:30:02,360
I couldn't make out
why Mr Tombsthay fell.

797
01:30:03,153 --> 01:30:07,574
I saw you throw down the revolver,
then I understood what happened.

798
01:30:07,699 --> 01:30:10,035
What a strange idea
to throw it away.

799
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,412
Is that what's called
"losing one's head"?

800
01:30:13,955 --> 01:30:17,167
Anyway, end of act one,
or rather, the first set,

801
01:30:17,292 --> 01:30:20,378
for in fact it's the second.
The match is in three sets.

802
01:30:23,173 --> 01:30:25,633
A few minutes earlier...

803
01:30:27,635 --> 01:30:31,097
I assume that you recognise
Mrs Tombsthay.

804
01:30:31,222 --> 01:30:35,060
That's what intrigued me.
I rushed for my camera...

805
01:30:35,185 --> 01:30:37,896
What was Mrs Tombsthay
watching so intently

806
01:30:38,021 --> 01:30:40,065
in Mr Tombsthay's living room?

807
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:50,200
Now onto the third set.

808
01:30:57,165 --> 01:31:00,960
You've just shot Mr Tombsthay,
and gone into the living room.

809
01:31:01,086 --> 01:31:04,089
Now, look carefully!

810
01:31:04,214 --> 01:31:09,135
You missed Mr Tombsthay.
He's merely injured.

811
01:31:09,260 --> 01:31:13,390
But, surprise, surprise,
Mrs Tombsthay returns.

812
01:31:16,142 --> 01:31:19,479
She picks up your revolver

813
01:31:19,604 --> 01:31:21,856
and match point!

814
01:31:21,981 --> 01:31:25,568
Mrs Tombsthay didn't miss Mr Tombsthay.

815
01:31:26,319 --> 01:31:27,654
The curtain falls.

816
01:31:29,739 --> 01:31:31,408
Well played, Julia!

817
01:31:31,533 --> 01:31:34,536
Don't be a bad loser.
The blame perhaps lies...

818
01:31:34,661 --> 01:31:38,790
Yes, I know. I fell into her arms
a little too quickly.

819
01:31:45,338 --> 01:31:48,383
What are you going to do?

820
01:31:48,508 --> 01:31:51,428
Leave... tomorrow.

821
01:31:51,553 --> 01:31:53,972
I hope to come into some money.

822
01:31:54,097 --> 01:31:57,976
And... until tomorrow?

823
01:31:58,101 --> 01:32:00,437
I don't know.

824
01:32:00,562 --> 01:32:03,231
Would you like to stay here?

825
01:32:05,275 --> 01:32:07,110
Yes.

826
01:32:10,405 --> 01:32:12,657
- Is your mother well?
- Yes.

827
01:32:12,782 --> 01:32:15,785
I start working with her next week.

828
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:19,748
- What do the two of you do?
- Detective work.

829
01:32:19,873 --> 01:32:24,627
- That can't be true...
- Do you take me for a liar?

830
01:32:25,795 --> 01:32:30,508
- What about the cane?
- I collect them.

831
01:32:30,633 --> 01:32:34,763
The day I moved,
I was holding one, so I limped...

832
01:32:36,514 --> 01:32:41,269
- Why?
- To draw more attention, Mr Aurphet.

833
01:32:41,394 --> 01:32:44,105
Now I remember
the story about the whore!

834
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:47,025
What whore? I don't know any whores.

835
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:50,195
She's waiting for a customer
by the broken street light.

836
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:53,323
A guy comes up and asks,
"How much?" She says, "200".

837
01:32:53,448 --> 01:32:57,619
He says, "No, that's too much, 1 50."
She says, "No, 200."

838
01:32:57,744 --> 01:33:01,664
He says, "Too bad," and heads off.
He soon returns.

839
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:07,712
He says, "OK, 200."
She says, "No, 250."

840
01:33:07,837 --> 01:33:13,426
The guy's taken aback. "But..."
She says, "Now, it's 250."

841
01:33:13,551 --> 01:33:17,013
He says, "Why?"
She says, "That's the way it is."

842
01:33:17,138 --> 01:33:23,937
He leaves. Soon he returns,
saying, "OK, then, 250."

843
01:33:24,062 --> 01:33:26,523
Now the woman hesitates.

844
01:33:27,857 --> 01:33:31,945
Finally she says, "OK,

845
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:36,825
but I hope you fuck well, because you
haven't got a clue about business."

846
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:14,529
No, don't leave.

847
01:34:14,654 --> 01:34:17,157
- David.
- Please.

848
01:34:17,282 --> 01:34:19,951
I think you know everything now.

849
01:34:20,035 --> 01:34:24,581
Yes, it was me who killed him.
He hated me.

850
01:34:26,791 --> 01:34:31,254
I hated him. And I loved him.

851
01:34:31,379 --> 01:34:35,342
You happened to come by...

852
01:34:36,843 --> 01:34:41,014
I'd have preferred you to be strong
enough to kill him all by yourself.

853
01:34:41,139 --> 01:34:44,642
You proved yourself
pretty clever as well, though.

854
01:34:44,768 --> 01:34:50,565
You and your friend were already
after the globe when we met.

855
01:34:51,858 --> 01:34:58,198
It's no drama. But you've aged as well.

856
01:34:58,323 --> 01:35:00,575
We're through. I'm through with you.

857
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:04,621
I'll... carry on somewhere else.

858
01:35:05,997 --> 01:35:09,334
"And the cursed lovers
never meet again. "

859
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:13,588
A pity. I could have loved you.

860
01:35:14,547 --> 01:35:17,008
Bye.

861
01:35:18,009 --> 01:35:21,096
My respects to you, my neighbour.

862
01:35:51,251 --> 01:35:56,840
If anyone comes out of this well,
it's you: rich and loved.

863
01:36:00,552 --> 01:36:05,724
Off you go. All the best to Viviane.

864
01:36:05,849 --> 01:36:08,518
And my congratulations.

865
01:36:38,506 --> 01:36:41,092
I can't stay, but I'll be back... soon!

866
01:36:41,217 --> 01:36:44,512
Look, I still have it!

867
01:36:45,055 --> 01:36:47,474
I wrote that I was going
to commit suicide.

868
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:51,895
Don't believe it. It was a joke!

869
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:46,176
I'm going on a trip.

870
01:38:46,301 --> 01:38:49,554
- Do you want to come with me?
- Yes. When?

871
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:52,349
Right now.

872
01:38:53,808 --> 01:38:56,561
I'll get my things ready.

873
01:38:58,772 --> 01:39:00,065
Come...

874
01:39:24,130 --> 01:39:26,591
I'm ready.
