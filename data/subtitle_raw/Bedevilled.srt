1
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:03,454
Paris, please.

2
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:06,491
May I see your passport
and ticket, please?

3
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:07,659
<i>Attention, please.</i>

4
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:09,360
<i>United airlines
announces the departure</i>

5
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:11,562
<i>of flight number 327
to Chicago.</i>

6
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:13,832
Tony. Tony,
my little bambino.

7
00:02:13,866 --> 00:02:16,768
Going to be
a fine priest.

8
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:19,638
Mom, I have years of study
before I'll be a priest.

9
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:23,141
But when you finish,
you'll be a good priest.

10
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:24,175
You hear?

11
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:29,580
That is what
he and his friend Gregory

12
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:31,315
will be studying for,
mama Lugacetti.

13
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,817
Peaches, Tony, for you and Gregory.

14
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:37,355
Tell the man who flies
the plane to make them hot.

15
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:38,322
Thanks.

16
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:40,859
Poor Tony, he's loved not enough,

17
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:42,326
but too well.

18
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:45,329
A skill with which only the
Italians exceed the Irish.

19
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:47,265
Yes,
that's quite a family.

20
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:50,368
You'll have a few days in Paris, Greg,

21
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:52,771
before you go
to the seminary.

22
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,840
I've cabled my old
friend father du rocher.

23
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:57,876
I'll give
you the address

24
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,311
of his church
in the montmartre.

25
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:02,280
Ha ha,
you know that man,

26
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:05,283
he's been over
30 years in Paris,

27
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:08,486
and he still disapproves of the place.

28
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,824
What are
you thinking about?

29
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:15,293
Why the shadows,
hmm?

30
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:18,329
What inner mountains of
doubt do they reflect?

31
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:19,831
Hills, father,
not mountains.

32
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:21,299
I guess I'm scared.

33
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,301
Oh, you've been
scared before,

34
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:26,104
in Korea, as a prisoner of war.

35
00:03:26,138 --> 00:03:27,572
But not like this.

36
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:31,242
The things I saw
there made me...

37
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:33,311
Scared and strong
at the same time,

38
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:34,846
gave me courage
to want to go on

39
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,815
and become a priest.

40
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,850
But now, I don't know.

41
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:40,752
It's only natural to
be suddenly appalled

42
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:43,855
at the enormity of the
responsibility to God,

43
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:45,824
to ourselves.

44
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,358
But I'm flesh, father,

45
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:49,260
flesh more than spirit.

46
00:03:49,294 --> 00:03:51,863
I'm lost in the theories
and philosophies.

47
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,297
I only come to roost

48
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:56,300
when I translate
in terms of people.

49
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:59,370
Suffering and despair
don't make me humble.

50
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:00,705
They make me angry.

51
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,942
Beauty and compassion don't
make me humble, either.

52
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:07,245
That's why I'm scared.

53
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:10,514
Greg, for a long time
you've led one life.

54
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:13,218
Now you're going
to live another way

55
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,319
to which
you'll add control,

56
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:16,788
self-denial,

57
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,056
discipline.

58
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,158
Elevation
is never easy.

59
00:04:21,927 --> 00:04:23,795
But being
born a second time

60
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:26,765
is no more difficult
than the first.

61
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,566
Do you think
I'll make it, father?

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,034
I think you have.

63
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,035
<i>Attention, please.</i>

64
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,737
<i>Panamerican world airways</i>

65
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:38,042
<i>announces the departure
of flight number 90 to Paris.</i>

66
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,543
Good-bye, mama.

67
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,321
And don't
get drunk.

68
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:51,856
Thanks.

69
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,798
Tony, you hear,
you be a good priest.

70
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,299
Take care
of yourself, ma.

71
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,600
Arrivaderci!

72
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:14,645
Excuse me.

73
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,048
Greg, I've solved
the mystery,

74
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:18,482
and documented it.

75
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:21,319
The one with the 4,000
yards of mink and 50 bags

76
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:22,854
who smells like
an Egyptian princess

77
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:24,289
is francesca.

78
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,825
My acquaintance with Egyptian
princesses is very limited.

79
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:28,860
Who is her highness?

80
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:30,295
Who is francesca?

81
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,797
Greg, how unworldly can you get?

82
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,332
She's the famous
designer,

83
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,766
the celebrated
couturier.

84
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,302
That's
who's francesca.

85
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,370
Here,
take look at this.

86
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:40,471
Here...

87
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,777
"Certainly the natural waistline
bores me," says francesca.

88
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:49,814
"The long look is
newer than the new look,

89
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,817
"combined with the
renaissance of the bouffant.

90
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,786
You will fight it,
but you will succumb."

91
00:05:55,821 --> 00:05:57,788
She has courage,
that one,

92
00:05:57,823 --> 00:05:59,290
and a high
sense of art.

93
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,791
She's also
quite a dish.

94
00:06:00,826 --> 00:06:02,426
The full set.

95
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:07,198
Boy, what my sister
wouldn't give to meet her.

96
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,334
You know, my sister's
also in the rag business,

97
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,768
on seventh Avenue.

98
00:06:10,802 --> 00:06:12,270
She's an operator
of machines,

99
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:14,805
but she studies design
at night in Brooklyn.

100
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,807
How many sisters
do you have?

101
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:17,808
9.

102
00:06:17,843 --> 00:06:19,310
And one brother,
Frank.

103
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,811
Hey, do you know
what it means,

104
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:23,814
2 boys in one house
with 9 sisters?

105
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:27,352
Frank joins the marines
and I become a priest.

106
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,819
I like your family.

107
00:06:28,854 --> 00:06:30,955
If you like
action, yes.

108
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,225
Take my mother.

109
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,794
Mama Mia, there's a woman for you.

110
00:06:36,828 --> 00:06:40,598
Filled with
pasta and wine,

111
00:06:40,632 --> 00:06:43,501
<i>and per favore,
11 children.</i>

112
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,609
Oh.

113
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:54,745
Still bad?

114
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,848
With luck,
not for long.

115
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:00,285
Keep your head up.
Breathe through your mouth.

116
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,753
Would you gentlemen
like your dinner now?

117
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:04,322
We're serving
shrimp cocktail,

118
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:05,790
filet mignon with...

119
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,258
Oh, please,
lady, stop.

120
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:09,227
I'll wait until
he feels better.

121
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:12,496
You can be served in the
bar below, Mr. Fitzgerald.

122
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:13,965
Go ahead, Greg.

123
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:16,801
There are times when a tenth
child wants to be alone.

124
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:19,737
Go, sir.
Oxygen is indicated.

125
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:31,349
May I?

126
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:32,483
Mm-hmm.

127
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:02,646
<i>Merci.</i>

128
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:03,814
<i>Adequat.</i>

129
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:06,384
You speak French?

130
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:09,287
Just enough to make
myself misunderstood.

131
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:10,754
Much more clever.

132
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,756
In my experience,
complete understanding

133
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,293
leads to boredom.

134
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:17,795
That is a very
French point of view.

135
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,330
I am French.

136
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,798
I figured that out.

137
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:23,301
I figured out
you are American.

138
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:24,768
Omaha, originally.
Then Trenton.

139
00:08:24,803 --> 00:08:26,804
My name's
Gregory Fitzgerald.

140
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:29,807
Paris, originally.
Then Paris.

141
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:32,010
I'm madame francesca.

142
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,411
I know.

143
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:35,346
A natural waistline
bores you,

144
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,782
and you're putting all
your money on the long look.

145
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:40,351
You think the American
women will succumb?

146
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:41,352
Certainly not,

147
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,855
but I have to say something outrageous.

148
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,856
Why?

149
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,392
It is expected.

150
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:51,762
Why do you make me
so uncomfortable?

151
00:08:51,796 --> 00:08:54,365
Well, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

152
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,366
You stare.

153
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,867
No, not stare,

154
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,336
search.

155
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,704
And your eyes
are very blue.

156
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:03,741
And you have
a face like a man's.

157
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:06,277
Why, doesn't everybody?
I mean men.

158
00:09:06,311 --> 00:09:07,745
No.

159
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:11,315
No, men look like
mice or bats or owls,

160
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,752
and sometimes like boys.

161
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:17,321
But only rarely,
very, very rarely,

162
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:18,789
like men,

163
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,425
like you.

164
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:23,794
You are married,
of course?

165
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:24,795
No.

166
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:25,796
Divorced?

167
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,797
No.

168
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:27,798
Mm-hmm.

169
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:29,833
Arrangement?

170
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:32,803
Well, you could
say arrangements.

171
00:09:32,837 --> 00:09:34,305
Not probably
the way you mean,

172
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,074
but certainly
arrangements.

173
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:41,245
Your fiancee is beautiful, I suppose.

174
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,315
Of course you know, I
hate beautiful women,

175
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,850
just as I adore
beautiful men,

176
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:49,320
like you.

177
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:51,355
You mind
I say this?

178
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,856
No, not at all.

179
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:54,325
As a matter of fact,

180
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,793
I was a very
beautiful baby

181
00:09:55,827 --> 00:09:58,796
and I have a picture
on a fur rug to prove it.

182
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,333
Your fiancee,
she will not mind

183
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,768
if you show me
that picture?

184
00:10:04,803 --> 00:10:06,036
No?

185
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,505
My fiancee understands

186
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:10,374
everything I do
or say or think.

187
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:11,542
Good.

188
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:24,322
The front of the card,

189
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:26,857
an invitation
to my collection.

190
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:32,029
The back of the card,
my apartment in Paris.

191
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,000
All right,
all right.

192
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,305
Madame francesca?

193
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:15,806
I'll have no peace

194
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,775
until I introduce you to Mr. lugacetti.

195
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,843
I'll give you no peace
unless you do.

196
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:21,279
How do you do,
Mr. lugacetti?

197
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,314
I don't do well at all,
madame francesca.

198
00:11:23,348 --> 00:11:25,849
I could hardly
wait to stop flying

199
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:27,318
and I find
I still am.

200
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,353
You must go
to your hotel at once,

201
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,854
drink very dry champagne,

202
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:32,356
and eat herring.

203
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,292
It will absolutely
cure you.

204
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,360
I think I'd better
get him on a bus.

205
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,328
Nonsense.

206
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:39,830
I have a jalopy.
Be my guest.

207
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,832
We don't want
to crowd you.

208
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:45,069
Don't be silly.
That is exactly what I want.

209
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:18,836
You're sure you won't
come for a drink

210
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,170
right this minute?

211
00:12:20,205 --> 00:12:22,806
Thank you very much, but
it really isn't possible.

212
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:24,342
You've been
very kind.

213
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:26,009
Very,
thanks a million.

214
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:27,678
Good-bye.
Thanks again.

215
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,354
You're
father du rocher?

216
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:38,021
Yes.

217
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:41,492
Your name's lugacetti?

218
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:42,893
I'm Fitzgerald.
This is lugacetti.

219
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:43,827
Father.

220
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:46,830
I had planned to say
welcome to France,

221
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:50,368
but it's clear you have
already had a welcome

222
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,404
exceeding any possibility
I might extend.

223
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:54,838
Who was this woman?

224
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:56,340
A fellow
passenger, sir.

225
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,875
Tony wasn't
feeling very well,

226
00:12:57,909 --> 00:12:59,410
and she was very kind.

227
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:00,778
Perhaps it will teach you

228
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:03,347
not to go against
God's will.

229
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,316
Man was not meant to fly.

230
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,350
You agree?

231
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,252
Yes, now you agree.

232
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,820
Tomorrow when you're
feeling better,

233
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:12,923
you will not agree.

234
00:13:12,957 --> 00:13:15,459
How's my old friend,
father Cunningham?

235
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:16,494
He's well?

236
00:13:16,528 --> 00:13:17,495
Well.

237
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:18,829
Yes?

238
00:13:18,863 --> 00:13:19,863
What's this?

239
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,835
Do you know
that in Europe

240
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:26,304
you're a nothing,

241
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,306
a nobody
without a passport?

242
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,375
In Europe, only cats
do not have to

243
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,377
show their passport.

244
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,346
Now we go to my room.

245
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,849
I have put in
two mattresses on the floor.

246
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:40,818
Perhaps a hotel,
father, would be better?

247
00:13:40,852 --> 00:13:42,320
A hotel?
It would be foolish

248
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:45,323
for you to
pay at a hotel.

249
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,791
Priests must learn...

250
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,292
You're very kind,
father,

251
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,827
but Tony isn't
feeling very well

252
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:51,362
and it's only
for two nights.

253
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:52,896
You will be robbed.

254
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,365
However, if you insist,

255
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,900
I know the name
of a respectable one,

256
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:57,835
the Remy.

257
00:13:57,869 --> 00:13:59,370
Fine.
Let's get a taxi.

258
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:01,339
Taxi? Who do you think
you are,

259
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,773
the baron Rothschild?

260
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,309
We'll take the Metro,
the subway,

261
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,911
bottom of the hill.
Come on.

262
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:11,949
Monsieur.

263
00:14:19,858 --> 00:14:21,291
And from here,
monsieur,

264
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:25,830
you have the most
excellent view of the city,

265
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:29,233
if you look
in this manner.

266
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:31,569
Whoop.

267
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:33,371
<i>Merci.</i>

268
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,739
And look.

269
00:14:38,343 --> 00:14:39,844
You see?

270
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:40,845
How much?

271
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:42,847
1,400 francs.

272
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:43,814
O.K.

273
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,282
What?!

274
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:49,353
1,400 francs
for this room?

275
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,755
For this...

276
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:54,825
Look, the carpet
is a rat's dinner.

277
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,861
And there,
the ceiling,

278
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:57,828
it leaks.

279
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,764
You call this a room?

280
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,800
But I am
a poor man.

281
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:03,801
1,300.

282
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:04,802
800.

283
00:15:04,836 --> 00:15:06,737
Ah, no, no, no.

284
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:10,674
1,200?

285
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,810
1,100.

286
00:15:12,844 --> 00:15:14,344
<i>Tant pis.</i>

287
00:15:16,681 --> 00:15:19,683
But only one hour
of hot water.

288
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:25,790
You see?
Was I not right?

289
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,725
1,400 francs.

290
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,762
Ha. Do you realize what
one can buy for that?

291
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,832
Dinner for three
with a decent cheese.

292
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:37,768
And perhaps
even a peach.

293
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,804
If I have one weakness, gentlemen,

294
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,272
it's for
the peach of normandy.

295
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:45,843
The pink fuzz, the
light blush of the meat.

296
00:15:45,877 --> 00:15:50,013
And the juice
so sweet and delicate.

297
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,183
You will need food.

298
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:54,785
If you gentlemen
are not planning

299
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:00,491
to spend $25 apiece
at the tour de Juneire Maxim's,

300
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:03,260
perhaps you will be
good enough to meet me

301
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:05,262
at the restaurant
la camubier

302
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:06,296
la what?

303
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:07,230
La camubier.

304
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:09,800
It's only
a few blocks from here.

305
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,301
At 9:00
on the stroke.

306
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:13,103
<i>Au revoir.</i>

307
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,443
And welcome to Paris.

308
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:23,347
That's
a tough cookie.

309
00:16:23,381 --> 00:16:24,815
Did you see his face

310
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,784
when he talked
about the peach?

311
00:16:26,818 --> 00:16:29,052
He's not as tough
as he makes out.

312
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,824
How about a peach, Tony?

313
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:34,792
Oh, nothing.

314
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:37,628
Just let me
lie here.

315
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,297
I'll change my clothes

316
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:41,799
and have a look at Paris.

317
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,101
Don't wake me
when you get back.

318
00:16:51,576 --> 00:16:53,677
<i>Um, pardonner mol,
monsieur.</i>

319
00:16:57,348 --> 00:17:00,518
Sorry, I can't
speak French.

320
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:14,331
<i>Le restaurant
de la camubier?</i>

321
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,836
Straight down.

322
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,137
10 streets,

323
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:22,840
<i>then you turn a la gauche, this way,</i>

324
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,274
two streets more,

325
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:26,309
then you arrive
on the boulevard.

326
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:29,312
You turn right,
this way, and then...

327
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:30,347
You understand?

328
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,314
No.

329
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:32,983
You take me.

330
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,288
<i>Oh, pardon,
monsieur.</i>

331
00:17:39,257 --> 00:17:41,792
I'm sorry.
I don't speak French.

332
00:17:41,826 --> 00:17:44,261
Oh, no, not an American.
What a piece of luck.

333
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:45,696
Could I have
your cab?

334
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,767
I've been looking for one
for a half-hour and I'm late.

335
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:51,201
All right,
let's share it.

336
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:53,704
You don't have to cash
so many traveler's checks.

337
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:56,840
It's all right if we're
pointed the same way.

338
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,778
It's not out of
your way. O.K.?

339
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:01,779
O.K.

340
00:18:01,813 --> 00:18:03,413
Thanks.

341
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,220
What a city, Paris.

342
00:18:10,254 --> 00:18:13,256
So much to see and only
three days to do it.

343
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,492
I could spend a year
in the louvre alone.

344
00:18:15,526 --> 00:18:18,762
I was only able to give
the Mona Lisa 10 seconds

345
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:20,263
and
the winged victory 15.

346
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:22,866
But what about
that Venus de milo?

347
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:23,968
Huh?

348
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:27,404
Well, I liked it.

349
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:31,075
What I'd like now, mister, is
practically no conversation.

350
00:18:43,855 --> 00:18:45,789
Have a cigarette.

351
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,725
Thanks.

352
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,794
I didn't mean anything
by that last remark.

353
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,429
I'm just beat.

354
00:19:05,209 --> 00:19:06,209
Anything wrong?

355
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:07,277
Nothing.

356
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:08,812
And don't mix in.

357
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,922
Hey wait,
your bag!

358
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:30,300
Thanks.

359
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:51,588
Here you are.

360
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,334
I want to speak
to Monica, please.

361
00:20:37,368 --> 00:20:39,837
Is she expecting you?
Just through that door.

362
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,304
Thank you.

363
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:54,684
<i>Entre.</i>

364
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:02,826
Well.

365
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,995
Fell out
of your bag.

366
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:08,298
I don't know
how you managed

367
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:09,800
to get through
all that traffic

368
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:11,301
without
St. Christopher.

369
00:21:11,335 --> 00:21:14,037
It's uh-sort of
a good luck charm.

370
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:17,141
That's the second time
you've been nice tonight.

371
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,842
Thanks a lot.
Good night.

372
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:20,778
Is there
something I can do?

373
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,846
You seem rather upset and I thought...

374
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,782
I told you before
not to mix in.

375
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:28,018
Why don't you go look
at some more statues?

376
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,522
<i>Entre.</i>

377
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:36,827
Monica Johnson?

378
00:21:36,861 --> 00:21:37,861
<i>Oul.</i>

379
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,864
Police.

380
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:05,455
Identification
papers.

381
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:18,802
Where are you staying?

382
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,238
Hotel Remy. Why?

383
00:22:27,946 --> 00:22:29,012
<i>Bonsoir,
mademoiselle.</i>

384
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:30,513
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

385
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:34,017
<i>A bientot, monsieur.</i>

386
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,061
See, darling.
Scatterbrain, but hopeless.

387
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:49,333
Forgot completely to renew
my alien labor permit.

388
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,869
Three months ago,
I sang at the call club

389
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,370
in London for two weeks

390
00:22:53,404 --> 00:22:56,340
before I remembered
I was supposed to be

391
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,841
at le sardine d'or
in cannes.

392
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,778
Hand me that bottle of
perfume, will you, darling?

393
00:23:01,812 --> 00:23:02,812
Thanks.

394
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,784
Oh, you understand French.

395
00:23:07,818 --> 00:23:09,719
A word
here and there.

396
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:13,757
"A bientot," that means see
you again very soon, doesn't it?

397
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,325
It's so much more
charming in French.

398
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,794
Even when
a detective says it?

399
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:20,463
Especially when
a detective says it.

400
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,768
I don't like cops.

401
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:26,836
Why did he want to
see my identification?

402
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:28,305
Maybe because
he envied you.

403
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:29,773
And not because
you'd told him

404
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:31,775
you'd spent the last
couple of hours with me?

405
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:34,311
Maybe that's why
he envied you.

406
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:37,214
He said he'd see me
again very soon.

407
00:23:37,248 --> 00:23:39,883
Don't you think I'm
entitled to an explanation?

408
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,318
Yes, you certainly are.

409
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:42,852
But what's the point?

410
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:44,354
If the cops come,

411
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:46,856
you just tell them
exactly what happened.

412
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:48,292
You won't get hurt.

413
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:50,794
If you want to lie a
little for me, o.K.,

414
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:52,829
but I'm not
asking you.

415
00:23:52,863 --> 00:23:54,864
Do me one
more favor, huh?

416
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:56,366
Then you can tell
all your friends

417
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:57,901
about your crazy
night in Paris.

418
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,270
Put me in a cab, huh?

419
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,307
<i>Just that,
and then au revoir.</i>

420
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,310
I have a very large
lump of curiosity.

421
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,813
What kills cats
can also kill Americans.

422
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:11,281
Do you...

423
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,917
Want to carry
the luggage, Porter?

424
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,061
Uh...

425
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,795
Just to make it
a better story

426
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,264
when you tell it
in the states,

427
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:29,232
we're going out
the back way.

428
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,733
Complete with
cobblestones, alley,

429
00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:33,971
and suspicious characters
lurking in the dark.

430
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,653
Let her go!

431
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:03,266
What's that?

432
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:04,734
Where I live.

433
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:07,270
If he followed you here,
he'll follow you there.

434
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,373
I have to go,
I have to.

435
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:12,275
I don't know what I would
have done without you.

436
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,776
Let me give
you some advice.

437
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:15,745
Just get out of
this cab and forget it.

438
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:18,281
You're hardly in a
position to give advice.

439
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:19,816
What have you done,
Monica?

440
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,351
Why the cops?
Why that man?

441
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,752
What do you care?

442
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:24,221
Because I'm angry.

443
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:25,822
I don't like
being hit,

444
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:27,290
and I like even less
to hit back.

445
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,825
You're pretty good at it.

446
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:30,293
What are you,
a prizefighter?

447
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:31,961
No, I'm not
a prizefighter.

448
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:33,296
And you're not in just a little trouble.

449
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,765
You've got big trouble.
What is it?

450
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:37,834
What's that got
to do with you?

451
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:40,870
How about taking
your hands off me?

452
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:41,804
O.K., o.K.

453
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,841
I'll feel better
if I admit it.

454
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:46,343
Everybody
feels better

455
00:25:46,377 --> 00:25:48,045
when they relieve
the pressure.

456
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,848
It's an old and very
famous cure.

457
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:53,350
You're a strange guy.

458
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:55,818
There are lots of
people like me.

459
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:57,287
I've never met any.

460
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:00,257
I think you have
but didn't know it.

461
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:03,460
The black stuff on your eyes is running.

462
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:07,830
Is it smeared?

463
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:09,466
Less than before.

464
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:11,768
Listen mister
whatever your name is,

465
00:26:11,802 --> 00:26:14,271
I don't know
you from ac/dc

466
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:17,207
and you've probably
got a highly developed angle,

467
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:18,808
but you're right, I've got
trouble and I need help,

468
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:20,243
the ask no
questions kind.

469
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,780
Well then, there's no
point in asking questions.

470
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:25,315
Anyway, the only
truth that matters

471
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:27,350
is the kind
you have to tell.

472
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:28,785
What can I do?

473
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:32,189
Stick with me until I get
a plane and shake this town.

474
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:35,258
Oh. I've got somebody
waiting for me.

475
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,693
Could you call them?

476
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:38,795
Haven't you got
anybody else?

477
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:40,964
No, not right now.

478
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:45,502
Well then, I have no choice, have I?

479
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,317
Can I have
that suitcase?

480
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:31,914
Telephone
your friends in here.

481
00:27:34,485 --> 00:27:35,918
Here's the phone book.

482
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:37,387
I'll make it fast.

483
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:38,855
We'll be out of here
in two minutes.

484
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:40,357
Where are you going?

485
00:27:40,391 --> 00:27:41,858
As far as I can get.

486
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:42,792
Home?

487
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:45,728
No, I don't think so.
Cuba, maybe.

488
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:49,599
I'll be a sensation.
Wait'll you catch my samba.

489
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:52,602
You have a curious way
of facing reality.

490
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,837
You deny it,
bury it under a joke.

491
00:27:54,872 --> 00:27:57,374
I thought that was
supposed to be good.

492
00:27:57,408 --> 00:27:58,841
Not always.

493
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:01,911
How long have
you been in Europe?

494
00:28:30,774 --> 00:28:31,774
I don't
understand you.

495
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:35,945
Oh, I see.
I ask you, "where is she?"

496
00:28:37,748 --> 00:28:39,316
That's what
I'd like to know.

497
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,283
Why?

498
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,785
For my own reasons.
What are yours?

499
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,221
I suspect you know them.

500
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,323
You're obviously
a good friend of Monica's.

501
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,258
Is she here?

502
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:50,727
Isn't this
a waste of time?

503
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:52,329
You can see for yourself she isn't.

504
00:28:52,363 --> 00:28:53,296
Good night.

505
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,997
Perhaps I have
a misunderstanding.

506
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:57,367
How did you get in?

507
00:28:57,401 --> 00:28:59,402
With a key.

508
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,737
The key?

509
00:29:00,771 --> 00:29:03,773
Yes, with a key
you could get in,

510
00:29:03,807 --> 00:29:05,775
a key like this one.

511
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:07,877
Now show me yours.

512
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,182
No. You do not
have a key.

513
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:15,151
You came here with her.

514
00:29:15,185 --> 00:29:17,621
Now tell me,
where is she?

515
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:19,188
I don't know.

516
00:29:19,223 --> 00:29:20,189
So again,

517
00:29:20,224 --> 00:29:23,360
how did you get in?

518
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:25,795
You've got it all.

519
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:28,265
I will tell you.

520
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,800
You came here
with Monica Johnson.

521
00:29:30,834 --> 00:29:33,803
Do not be difficult.
Do not be noble.

522
00:29:33,837 --> 00:29:35,838
It makes me feel unkind.

523
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:36,839
So please,

524
00:29:36,874 --> 00:29:37,974
please!

525
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:09,572
Hello?

526
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:10,607
Qul.

527
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:13,810
Lugacetti?

528
00:30:13,844 --> 00:30:17,847
How dare you call me
at this hour?

529
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:19,382
Who?

530
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:20,383
Gregory?

531
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,951
Here?

532
00:30:21,985 --> 00:30:23,886
Certainly not!

533
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:26,456
No, I did not see him.

534
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,328
Oh. Don't worry,
Mr. lugacetti.

535
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:34,364
To stay out
all night in Paris

536
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:35,865
is amusing.

537
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:38,868
The worst that can
happen to him

538
00:30:38,902 --> 00:30:41,904
is that he will have
a bad hangover.

539
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:43,906
Well, thank you,
madame francesca.

540
00:30:43,941 --> 00:30:45,908
I'm sorry to
have bothered you.

541
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:47,910
Good-bye.

542
00:30:47,945 --> 00:30:48,878
Not there.

543
00:30:48,912 --> 00:30:50,279
She hasn't seen him.

544
00:30:50,314 --> 00:30:52,915
That's not what she'll
say in a confessional.

545
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,317
I believe her, father.

546
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,853
Gregory wouldn't do this.
You don't know him.

547
00:30:56,887 --> 00:30:58,388
He's dedicated.

548
00:30:58,422 --> 00:31:01,725
To the flesh,
perhaps?

549
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:03,827
Let's review the circumstances then.

550
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:06,830
We were supposed to
have dinner at 9:00.

551
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:08,331
He doesn't come.

552
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,833
I came here
at midnight

553
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:12,369
when I should
long be in bed.

554
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,670
We wait.

555
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:17,073
At 6:00, we call to see
if there's an accident.

556
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:18,775
There is
no accident.

557
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:22,812
Now we call the only other
human he knows in Paris.

558
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,313
She denies
seeing him.

559
00:31:24,348 --> 00:31:27,817
What is the logic
of the situation?

560
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,853
Something's the matter.

561
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:30,854
Yes,

562
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:33,356
but what?

563
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,825
If it is not folly,

564
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,362
it is certainly
irresponsibility.

565
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,330
Either fault is
a serious defect

566
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:45,268
in one who would
be a priest.

567
00:31:45,302 --> 00:31:48,838
Perhaps it's better he
should find out so soon,

568
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,807
before he embarks
upon a course

569
00:31:50,841 --> 00:31:53,476
for which he is
clearly unsuitable.

570
00:33:28,772 --> 00:33:30,206
Who are you?

571
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,808
What are
you doing here?

572
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:33,843
I'm the husband
of the concierge.

573
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:36,312
Miss Johnson
asked me to go in.

574
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:39,348
What did you say
about miss Johnson?

575
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:40,850
She-she telephoned.

576
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,385
She-
she wanted her purse.

577
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:43,853
Where is she?

578
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:45,855
Um...

579
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,790
I swore not to tell.

580
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:50,860
But you must tell me.
I'm her friend.

581
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,829
No, no.

582
00:33:52,863 --> 00:33:54,330
I don't know you.

583
00:33:54,364 --> 00:33:57,366
But I tell you
I'm her friend.

584
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:59,402
How can
I convince you?

585
00:33:59,436 --> 00:34:00,970
Are you catholic?

586
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,841
Catholic?

587
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,275
Yes, I am.

588
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:09,345
Well, I'm going
to be a priest.

589
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,348
Ha ha ha ha!

590
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:13,983
Look.

591
00:34:16,386 --> 00:34:17,453
Read it.

592
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:25,294
I believe you.

593
00:34:25,328 --> 00:34:29,866
Then where is she?

594
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,303
Napoleon.

595
00:34:34,337 --> 00:34:35,337
Napoleon's tomb?

596
00:34:35,372 --> 00:34:36,806
Oh, yes! Yes, sir!

597
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,507
I'll take it to her.

598
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:42,679
Americans.

599
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,557
Faster, faster!

600
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,897
Pull over
to the curb and stop!

601
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,428
What are
you doing here?

602
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:21,764
I wanted to find out
if you were safe.

603
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,233
Look at your face.
What did they do to you?

604
00:38:24,268 --> 00:38:26,035
There's nothing broken.
I'm all right.

605
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:27,770
I'm so sorry you got
mixed up in this.

606
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,840
Why don't you just
go away and forget me?

607
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:32,341
Where did you go?

608
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,810
I went out the balcony,

609
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:35,812
spent the night
in the Metro.

610
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,814
Soon as
this place opened,

611
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:39,816
I paid my old friend
Napoleon a visit.

612
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,784
How did you know
where I was?

613
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,286
The concierge's
husband.

614
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,821
He swore
he wouldn't tell.

615
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:46,588
I found a way
to persuade him.

616
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,327
There was
a letter in...

617
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:53,863
He took it
last night.

618
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:55,264
Who is he?

619
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,866
Trevelle, that's his name. Trevelle.

620
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,334
What does he want?

621
00:38:58,368 --> 00:39:00,436
Just to kill me, darling,
just to kill me.

622
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,437
But why?

623
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:04,073
Because he doesn't like
the color of my eyes.

624
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:06,775
Last night
before I met you,

625
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,313
I had the best seat
in the house at a murder.

626
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:11,747
And now...

627
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:18,787
Did they follow you?

628
00:39:18,822 --> 00:39:20,289
They tried,
but I got away.

629
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,291
You're sure?

630
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,293
What do you mean,
a murder?

631
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:27,796
A man, a friend,
his apartment.

632
00:39:27,831 --> 00:39:29,332
I don't remember much,

633
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:30,799
a door breaking open,

634
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:31,868
noise, guns.

635
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:34,837
When I looked up,
he was on the floor dead.

636
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,305
Then I ran.

637
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,341
Then you got
into my taxi?

638
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,775
Was it trevelle?

639
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:41,310
No. I don't know.

640
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:42,778
Just shots and guns.
I...

641
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:44,313
Can't you identify
the man?

642
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,814
No, but trevelle
thinks I can.

643
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:49,285
And he takes no chances,
no chances at all.

644
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:50,786
Why didn't
you tell

645
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,454
all this to the police last night?

646
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:53,789
Because I was
still kidding myself,

647
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:55,791
thinking no one would know
I was in the apartment.

648
00:39:55,825 --> 00:39:58,460
That's why I lied,
told them I was with you.

649
00:39:58,495 --> 00:39:59,828
All right. You must go to the police.

650
00:39:59,863 --> 00:40:01,297
I'll go with you.

651
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:03,832
You must tell them
your life is in danger.

652
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,334
You're such a child.

653
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:06,869
Suppose I go?

654
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,271
They look me up.

655
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,739
They'll find a singer in a
nightclub without a work permit.

656
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:12,275
I'm a foreigner,
I've broken their laws.

657
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,810
Think they'll give me a
guard of honor like Napoleon?

658
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:16,812
Oh, they wouldn't
believe me.

659
00:40:16,846 --> 00:40:18,781
You don't
know the police.

660
00:40:18,815 --> 00:40:20,316
And they wouldn't
touch trevelle.

661
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:22,851
He's a big shot
in Paris,

662
00:40:22,886 --> 00:40:24,287
well-known,
well-connected.

663
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:26,889
Don't you see?
It wouldn't do any good,

664
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,357
any good at all.

665
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:29,491
O.K.

666
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:33,595
We've got to see about
getting you out of Paris.

667
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,921
<i>Merci, monsieur.
Merci.</i>

668
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:33,922
<i>Merci.</i>

669
00:41:33,957 --> 00:41:34,890
Monsieur?

670
00:41:34,924 --> 00:41:36,892
A reservation
to uh-Brazil

671
00:41:36,926 --> 00:41:40,096
or any flight en route
leaving immediately.

672
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:46,568
The most immediate
is to Lisbon.

673
00:41:46,603 --> 00:41:48,371
For yourself,
monsieur?

674
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:50,506
For a friend, a lady.

675
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,810
We can accommodate
madame on flight 95

676
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:57,346
leaving orly tomorrow
afternoon at 6:30 P.M.

677
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:58,481
Nothing sooner?

678
00:41:58,515 --> 00:41:59,581
Nothing.

679
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:03,852
Nationality?

680
00:42:03,887 --> 00:42:05,787
American.

681
00:42:05,822 --> 00:42:06,955
Madame's name,
please.

682
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:07,890
Monica Johnson,

683
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:10,792
but for private reasons,
no publicity.

684
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:13,862
She's traveling under
an assumed name,

685
00:42:13,897 --> 00:42:15,831
say uh...

686
00:42:15,865 --> 00:42:16,999
Mary Jonas.

687
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,800
Of course,
I understand.

688
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:21,870
But the passport is in
the name of Monica Johnson?

689
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:22,838
Yes.

690
00:42:22,872 --> 00:42:25,807
May I see it,
please?

691
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:27,843
I don't have it
with me.

692
00:42:27,877 --> 00:42:29,878
Can you remember
the number?

693
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:30,846
No.

694
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,348
But I'll get it.

695
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:35,351
You go ahead
and make the arrangements.

696
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:49,365
Lisbon tomorrow night,
and then Brazil.

697
00:42:49,399 --> 00:42:50,399
Nothing sooner?

698
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:51,900
And what about tonight?

699
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:52,834
My hotel.

700
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:55,337
It's out of the way
and respectable.

701
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:58,340
Now I've got to
have your passport.

702
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,076
I haven't got it.

703
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,510
Where is it?

704
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:04,313
Quite safe and neat in the
middle drawer of my desk.

705
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:05,781
You see how careful
and methodical I am.

706
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:07,249
You've
got to get it.

707
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,785
Sure. Let's pick up some
clothes at the same time.

708
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:12,821
Only trevelle's chums
are hiding in the closet.

709
00:43:12,855 --> 00:43:14,156
No. I'll go anyway.

710
00:43:14,191 --> 00:43:15,724
No, no.
I won't let you.

711
00:43:15,758 --> 00:43:18,327
If they're there, it'll be
last night all over again.

712
00:43:18,361 --> 00:43:19,795
I can get in and out

713
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:21,330
and they'll
never know it.

714
00:43:21,364 --> 00:43:22,864
Take this taxi
to the hotel Remy.

715
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:25,801
I'll be back with the
passport and ticket.

716
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:27,470
Have a little faith.

717
00:43:33,543 --> 00:43:35,144
Hotel Remy.

718
00:44:05,842 --> 00:44:07,309
Get me
the American embassy.

719
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:09,245
Embassy?
Why the embassy?

720
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,280
Your passport's
been stolen.

721
00:44:11,314 --> 00:44:14,716
Oh. That's par
for the course.

722
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:16,785
I don't know
what's in here,

723
00:44:16,819 --> 00:44:18,354
but it's gotta
be better than that.

724
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:19,321
Thanks.

725
00:44:19,356 --> 00:44:20,356
Telephone,
monsieur.

726
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,790
Let me take it.

727
00:44:21,824 --> 00:44:24,360
I'm an old hand
with embassies.

728
00:44:24,394 --> 00:44:26,762
American embassy?

729
00:44:26,796 --> 00:44:28,964
Passport division,
please.

730
00:44:31,234 --> 00:44:32,134
Hello?

731
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,170
Can I have
some information?

732
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:36,672
What happens when
an American citizen

733
00:44:36,706 --> 00:44:39,007
mislays his passport?

734
00:44:41,244 --> 00:44:42,144
I see.

735
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,812
Can it be done
in Paris?

736
00:44:43,846 --> 00:44:45,981
How long
does that take?

737
00:44:47,884 --> 00:44:49,485
Thank you very much.

738
00:44:50,887 --> 00:44:52,854
Hopeless.

739
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:54,290
Maybe not
so hopeless,

740
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,825
once you've had a cup
of coffee and a bath.

741
00:44:56,859 --> 00:44:58,894
I'd like a room
for the lady, please.

742
00:44:58,928 --> 00:45:00,462
For miss Johnson?

743
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:04,300
How did you know
her name?

744
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:05,767
There have
been inquiries.

745
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:08,837
Always they ask for miss Johnson.

746
00:45:08,871 --> 00:45:09,771
The police?

747
00:45:09,806 --> 00:45:12,274
They say they are the police.

748
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,811
But when one is making
inquiries, who does not?

749
00:45:15,845 --> 00:45:17,313
Well, that eliminates
this hotel,

750
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:18,780
and probably
a lot of others.

751
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:20,282
Sorry it wasn't
more fun.

752
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:22,284
But you've
nowhere to go.

753
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,286
Check.
I can't stay here,

754
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,787
and I can't
leave the country,

755
00:45:25,822 --> 00:45:27,323
and I can't
get a passport

756
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:29,057
without
an act of congress.

757
00:45:29,092 --> 00:45:30,626
Is there someplace
where I...

758
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,294
I don't mean
to intrude,

759
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,764
but perhaps uh-
I can be helpful?

760
00:45:35,798 --> 00:45:40,336
You know we have strange laws in Paris.

761
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,272
Hotels require
passports,

762
00:45:43,306 --> 00:45:46,808
but sometimes when it is inconvenient,

763
00:45:46,843 --> 00:45:51,313
citizens must make
their own arrangements.

764
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:55,551
They are
of course...

765
00:45:55,585 --> 00:45:56,818
Expensive.

766
00:45:56,853 --> 00:45:58,820
But if you know
the right man...

767
00:45:58,855 --> 00:46:00,256
Do you know
the right man?

768
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,258
He is the right man.

769
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:05,327
Perhaps for...

770
00:46:05,362 --> 00:46:06,328
20,000 francs...

771
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:07,829
What does that buy?

772
00:46:07,864 --> 00:46:09,331
Privacy,

773
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,332
discretion.

774
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,334
Where?

775
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:13,835
I have an address.

776
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:16,805
Do you know
where it is?

777
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:18,807
No, but I bet I can
describe the neighborhood.

778
00:46:18,841 --> 00:46:20,576
Do I have
to have a password?

779
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,313
20,000 francs, you will
be expected and welcomed.

780
00:46:24,347 --> 00:46:26,348
I can imagine
in this outfit,

781
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,383
too welcome.

782
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:30,852
Is there someplace
where I can dress the part?

783
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:36,492
Stop the jokes.

784
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,227
This doesn't
make sense.

785
00:46:39,262 --> 00:46:40,796
You don't know
where you're going

786
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,298
or what you'll do.

787
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:43,766
Just what
would you suggest?

788
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,902
The least you can do
is to face the facts.

789
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:49,237
I've been beating myself
over the head with facts.

790
00:46:49,272 --> 00:46:50,839
I'm thinking
in circles.

791
00:46:50,873 --> 00:46:51,807
Wait.

792
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:53,842
Maybe we can work this out together.

793
00:46:53,876 --> 00:46:55,477
I'll go with you.

794
00:46:58,381 --> 00:47:00,282
Who appointed
you my...

795
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,583
Private guardian?

796
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,321
I don't know.

797
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,322
Certainly somebody.

798
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,956
Tell him thanks.

799
00:47:09,292 --> 00:47:11,059
I won't be long.

800
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:17,700
Are my friends here,

801
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,735
father du rocher
and Mr. lugacetti?

802
00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:22,304
No, they are out
looking for you.

803
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,806
They think
that you are

804
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,774
at the bottom
of the seine.

805
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:27,843
Tell them
I'll be on schedule.

806
00:47:27,877 --> 00:47:29,311
Well, in any case,

807
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,912
not to worry.

808
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,244
We're from
the Remy.

809
00:48:02,278 --> 00:48:03,812
Yes, I know.
Come in.

810
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:19,961
Romantic, isn't it?

811
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:26,835
The money.

812
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:27,969
Oh.

813
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:35,778
You understand,

814
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,279
only until
tomorrow night?

815
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:40,148
<i>Dacor?</i>

816
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:43,018
Oh, uh-um...

817
00:48:43,052 --> 00:48:44,686
American plan,
food, wine.

818
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:50,426
300 francs?

819
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,293
Oul.

820
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:52,861
I'll bet
it's delicious.

821
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:53,962
Here.

822
00:49:02,238 --> 00:49:03,906
The service
wasn't included.

823
00:49:07,243 --> 00:49:08,710
It's vinegar
and acorns.

824
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,279
But it's
warm and good.

825
00:49:11,314 --> 00:49:12,881
Want some more?

826
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,785
It may be bad for
some people's livers,

827
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,286
but it's great for mine.

828
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:20,756
I feel better.

829
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:22,223
Well,
at least you can say

830
00:49:22,258 --> 00:49:23,692
you've seen
the part of Paris

831
00:49:23,726 --> 00:49:25,260
that isn't
loaded with tourists.

832
00:49:25,294 --> 00:49:26,695
Oughtta make
quite a chapter

833
00:49:26,729 --> 00:49:28,964
in your "my trip abroad" diary.

834
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:33,301
Look at this joint.

835
00:49:33,336 --> 00:49:35,804
Not exactly
the ritz, is it?

836
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,806
I usually
do better than this.

837
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:39,341
The Dorchester in London,

838
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:40,843
grand in Rome,

839
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:42,811
verjahr in hamburg.

840
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,312
At least
one piece of luggage

841
00:49:44,347 --> 00:49:46,815
in every hotel
on the continent.

842
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,485
The story of my life.

843
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,655
Could I have
a cigarette?

844
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,759
Why don't you tell me
about the Monica Johnson

845
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,461
who once had all her
luggage under one roof?

846
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:04,833
Well, the story I usually
tell to susceptible gentlemen

847
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:07,335
is the one about
the drunken father

848
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,638
with the mother
he used to beat.

849
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:15,276
And then, oh, I add 6 or
7 brothers and sisters,

850
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:18,814
and do a charming little sketch
of myself bringing them up,

851
00:50:18,848 --> 00:50:21,817
a model of patience
and womanly virtue.

852
00:50:21,851 --> 00:50:23,519
What does
that get you?

853
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,288
A good dinner.

854
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:31,092
And occasionally,
a souvenir.

855
00:50:31,127 --> 00:50:33,795
A diamond bracelet
or a mink coat?

856
00:50:37,266 --> 00:50:39,635
You wouldn't happen to have
either around, would you?

857
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:41,603
No.

858
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,807
Then you get the truth.

859
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,342
I haven't told it
in so long

860
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:49,377
I can hardly
remember it.

861
00:50:49,412 --> 00:50:51,914
I was born in
willow falls, Nebraska,

862
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,381
well over
21 years ago.

863
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:55,884
My real name
is Jenny corbell.

864
00:50:55,919 --> 00:50:59,888
My mother and father,
very nice people.

865
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,324
I was a stinker.

866
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:06,828
I looked like an angel
on a Christmas tree,

867
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:10,832
and boy crazy
right from the beginning.

868
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:12,333
My first boyfriend at 12,

869
00:51:12,368 --> 00:51:14,369
the second
boyfriend at 12,

870
00:51:14,403 --> 00:51:16,638
my third boyfriend at 12.

871
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:22,343
At 17, I smiled
at the right bald head

872
00:51:22,378 --> 00:51:25,847
and won the local
beauty contest.

873
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:30,185
Dissolve, New York,
Paris, Rome.

874
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:34,556
That was 8 years ago.

875
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:38,994
Are your parents
still alive?

876
00:51:39,028 --> 00:51:40,829
You need them
badly now.

877
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:44,399
I need a miracle,
darling.

878
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:46,401
Nothing grand.

879
00:51:46,435 --> 00:51:49,304
Just a small spit
of a miracle will do.

880
00:51:49,338 --> 00:51:52,641
There are no small miracles, Monica.

881
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,745
You're very nice.

882
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,618
Why didn't
you go home?

883
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:03,986
Oh...

884
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:08,090
I'm little girl turtle,
darling,

885
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,325
carry my home
on my back.

886
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:12,293
And darling...

887
00:52:12,328 --> 00:52:14,329
You know why I call
you darling or mister?

888
00:52:14,363 --> 00:52:16,331
I don't know your name.

889
00:52:16,365 --> 00:52:17,833
Gregory.

890
00:52:17,867 --> 00:52:18,800
Yes.

891
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,737
That feels right.

892
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:27,943
I...

893
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:31,546
Find you very warm,
Gregory,

894
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,815
and full of a quality
I've never known before.

895
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,851
I don't know
what it is.

896
00:52:35,885 --> 00:52:39,254
Only it's exciting,

897
00:52:39,288 --> 00:52:41,857
and a little marvelous.

898
00:52:41,891 --> 00:52:43,859
You're so distant.

899
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:45,761
Don't be.

900
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:49,064
I'm closer than you think, Monica,

901
00:52:49,098 --> 00:52:51,700
far closer than if I
touched you or held you.

902
00:52:53,302 --> 00:52:56,838
You're a strange guy,
the oddest I've ever met.

903
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,808
Don't keep
saying that.

904
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:01,342
I hit a nerve.

905
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:02,811
What nerve, Gregory?

906
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:04,713
What makes
you so different?

907
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:08,884
I'm not so different.

908
00:53:08,918 --> 00:53:11,452
I'm exactly like
any other man,

909
00:53:11,487 --> 00:53:13,354
only I...

910
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:14,489
I'm...

911
00:53:14,523 --> 00:53:17,926
Thinking about how to
get you out of here.

912
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,829
When it's dark, I'll
see about getting a car.

913
00:53:20,863 --> 00:53:22,463
Then we'll go.

914
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:30,338
Sure. When it's dark.

915
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,247
What did he say?

916
00:53:39,281 --> 00:53:41,717
He said there's someone
downstairs waiting for you.

917
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,351
Knows you're here,
won't go.

918
00:53:43,385 --> 00:53:44,986
Who is it?

919
00:53:55,898 --> 00:53:57,332
Where are you going?

920
00:53:57,366 --> 00:53:58,867
I want to
talk to him.

921
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:00,001
It's all right.

922
00:54:09,545 --> 00:54:10,511
Hello, Tony.

923
00:54:10,546 --> 00:54:11,646
Hi, Greg.

924
00:54:14,784 --> 00:54:16,317
How did you find me?

925
00:54:16,352 --> 00:54:18,486
Easy. I bribed
the Porter.

926
00:54:21,557 --> 00:54:23,358
Why are
you hiding, Greg?

927
00:54:23,392 --> 00:54:24,760
What are you doing?

928
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:27,996
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

929
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,367
Call it an act of mercy.

930
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:33,802
An act of mercy?

931
00:54:33,836 --> 00:54:35,771
Greg, I know the cops
are looking for you.

932
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,239
You're hiding out
in the slums.

933
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,807
There's a woman they keep talking about.

934
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:42,377
What kind of an act of mercy is this?

935
00:54:42,411 --> 00:54:43,779
Let me help, huh?

936
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:45,313
Don't get involved,
Tony.

937
00:54:45,347 --> 00:54:46,815
Well,
somebody's got to!

938
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:48,283
Look, you're in
a strange country.

939
00:54:48,317 --> 00:54:49,785
You don't even
speak the language.

940
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,887
I know you're doing
something you think is right.

941
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:53,288
Maybe it is.

942
00:54:53,322 --> 00:54:56,357
But you can't handle
this load all alone.

943
00:54:56,392 --> 00:54:58,393
Talk to someone,
get some advice.

944
00:54:58,427 --> 00:54:59,360
From whom?

945
00:54:59,395 --> 00:55:00,461
Father du rocher.

946
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,334
I can't
involve him either.

947
00:55:06,368 --> 00:55:07,235
Then francesca.

948
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,804
She's
worried about you.

949
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:10,305
How did she know?

950
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:11,840
Because
I called her.

951
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:12,808
Look, Greg,

952
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,742
if you can't ask me,

953
00:55:14,777 --> 00:55:16,978
why don't
you ask her?

954
00:55:20,783 --> 00:55:23,952
I've got to work this out by myself.

955
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:27,956
O.K.

956
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:33,361
Tomorrow, the train
leaves for the seminary.

957
00:55:33,395 --> 00:55:34,996
Do I go alone?

958
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,835
I don't know, Tony.

959
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:41,536
I don't know.

960
00:57:01,517 --> 00:57:02,984
Who was he?

961
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,485
A friend of mine.

962
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,254
How did he know
we were here?

963
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:08,290
How do I know
I can trust him?

964
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,824
I'd better get out.

965
00:57:09,858 --> 00:57:10,725
No, Monica.

966
00:57:10,759 --> 00:57:12,794
Tony's all right.
We're safe.

967
00:57:12,828 --> 00:57:16,764
How do I know
I can trust you?

968
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,300
You don't know how,

969
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:20,402
but you know you can.

970
00:57:23,806 --> 00:57:25,307
We've got
another chance.

971
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,208
My friend
gave me an idea.

972
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,811
There's someone here in
Paris who might help us,

973
00:57:29,845 --> 00:57:31,779
maybe get us a car.

974
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:33,848
You really believe
there's a chance?

975
00:57:33,882 --> 00:57:35,483
Of course I do.

976
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:42,824
"Evening falls on Paris
like a velvet scarf."

977
00:57:42,858 --> 00:57:44,792
I didn't make that up.

978
00:57:44,827 --> 00:57:48,830
That's a lyric from
a song I used to sing.

979
00:57:48,864 --> 00:57:51,799
Never caught
my act, did you?

980
00:57:51,834 --> 00:57:55,337
I'm not Jane Powell,
but I manage o.K.

981
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:57,339
Mostly phrasing
instead of a voice.

982
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:59,007
The customers
like it.

983
00:58:01,944 --> 00:58:04,612
That accordionist down
there is pretty good.

984
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:10,318
I used to sing that.

985
00:58:10,353 --> 00:58:11,419
Yeah.

986
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:16,391
I wore that slim black
job with the red stole.

987
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:24,366
¶ When I'm feeling
lost and low ¶

988
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,637
¶ embrasse,
embrasse-mol bien ¶

989
00:58:29,671 --> 00:58:35,310
¶ when my heart
has lost its glow ¶

990
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:38,779
¶ then kiss me
once again ¶

991
00:58:40,782 --> 00:58:42,250
¶ you're the one ¶

992
00:58:42,284 --> 00:58:46,354
¶ that
makes my life ¶

993
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:49,924
¶ my breath,
my heart, my soul ¶

994
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:57,232
¶ forget the day
that come what may ¶

995
00:58:57,266 --> 00:58:59,467
¶ embrasse,
embrasse... ¶

996
00:59:01,803 --> 00:59:02,937
Gregory.

997
00:59:06,742 --> 00:59:08,243
I'm not
brave anymore.

998
00:59:08,277 --> 00:59:10,245
I'm not even
gonna try.

999
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:12,213
I'm dead in my shoes

1000
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:15,316
and I'm too stubborn
to admit it.

1001
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:18,786
I give up.

1002
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,422
I've had it.

1003
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,678
I'd like to see
madame francesca.

1004
01:00:50,712 --> 01:00:52,247
Will you tell me
your name?

1005
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:53,214
Gregory Fitzgerald.

1006
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:54,882
Just a minute,
please.

1007
01:01:03,792 --> 01:01:06,327
You have been
a very naughty boy,

1008
01:01:06,362 --> 01:01:08,329
making us all
worry about you.

1009
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,198
And you look
the worst for it.

1010
01:01:10,232 --> 01:01:12,567
I'd like to talk to
you alone, if I could.

1011
01:01:12,601 --> 01:01:14,835
For the moment, I must
keep my body in the salon

1012
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:16,337
to encourage
the buyer.

1013
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,973
But we shall
have a corner.

1014
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:28,583
Now, what do
you have to confess?

1015
01:01:28,617 --> 01:01:29,884
I need a car,
francesca,

1016
01:01:29,918 --> 01:01:31,319
in confidence.

1017
01:01:31,353 --> 01:01:32,853
I want to get someone over the border,

1018
01:01:32,888 --> 01:01:34,289
someone without
a passport.

1019
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:37,358
<i>But you sound like
the Scarlet pimpernel.</i>

1020
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,860
What is this
extraordinary melodrama

1021
01:01:39,895 --> 01:01:41,862
in which
we are engaged?

1022
01:01:41,897 --> 01:01:43,831
Well, I met a girl.

1023
01:01:43,865 --> 01:01:44,799
What girl?

1024
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,301
I'd prefer to...

1025
01:01:46,335 --> 01:01:48,303
You don't imagine
I would help a girl

1026
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:49,904
whose name
I don't know.

1027
01:01:49,938 --> 01:01:51,206
Monica Johnson.

1028
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,407
Monica John...

1029
01:01:52,441 --> 01:01:54,576
Oh, yes, I know her.

1030
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,843
She sings
in a cabaret.

1031
01:01:55,877 --> 01:01:57,378
Yes,
that's the girl.

1032
01:01:57,413 --> 01:02:00,215
Yes, I made
a dress for her.

1033
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:03,184
Yes, she's a connection of trevelle's.

1034
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:04,419
Do you know him?

1035
01:02:04,453 --> 01:02:06,821
Yes, he's a customer
for many years.

1036
01:02:06,855 --> 01:02:08,923
He buys
dresses for many girls.

1037
01:02:08,957 --> 01:02:10,491
He stole
Monica's passport.

1038
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:12,993
Stole her passport?

1039
01:02:13,028 --> 01:02:13,994
Ha ha.

1040
01:02:14,029 --> 01:02:14,929
Dear Gregory,

1041
01:02:14,963 --> 01:02:16,464
somebody's
pulling your leg.

1042
01:02:16,498 --> 01:02:18,933
No. I know
it sounds corny,

1043
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:20,435
but it's
deadly serious.

1044
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:21,769
She witnessed
a murder

1045
01:02:21,803 --> 01:02:23,037
and he's mixed
up in it.

1046
01:02:23,071 --> 01:02:25,273
That cannot be so.

1047
01:02:25,307 --> 01:02:28,142
I don't like this.
You are lying to me.

1048
01:02:28,176 --> 01:02:31,145
I've no right
to ask your help,

1049
01:02:31,179 --> 01:02:32,547
and you've every right to refuse.

1050
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:34,048
No, no, darling.

1051
01:02:34,082 --> 01:02:36,551
Don't be so
hasty with me.

1052
01:02:36,585 --> 01:02:39,520
I shall help,
of course,

1053
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:43,324
but I think we shall
have to consult someone.

1054
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,426
Yes, with a friend.

1055
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:46,861
Let me call him
and we shall go together.

1056
01:02:46,895 --> 01:02:48,363
Hmm?

1057
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:49,330
Thanks.

1058
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:50,965
I knew
you would help.

1059
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:54,369
Where is he?

1060
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:55,836
I saw him here
yesterday.

1061
01:02:55,871 --> 01:02:57,405
Well,
he's not here now.

1062
01:02:57,439 --> 01:02:58,873
He is coming back?

1063
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:00,308
Now look,
just a minute.

1064
01:03:00,342 --> 01:03:02,277
Let me ask
a couple of questions.

1065
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:05,212
What are you doing here?
Why do you want him?

1066
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:06,814
We used to be
his friends

1067
01:03:06,848 --> 01:03:08,149
before he met you.

1068
01:03:08,183 --> 01:03:09,684
That's your problem,

1069
01:03:09,718 --> 01:03:11,319
and his.

1070
01:03:11,353 --> 01:03:12,754
Look, lady,
let him go.

1071
01:03:12,788 --> 01:03:14,789
Don't stop him from doing
what he came here for.

1072
01:03:14,823 --> 01:03:16,357
I'm not stopping
him from anything.

1073
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:17,692
How could I?

1074
01:03:17,726 --> 01:03:20,361
I don't know what he's doing
or where's he's going.

1075
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,863
You tell me.

1076
01:03:22,898 --> 01:03:24,231
Gregory and I,

1077
01:03:24,266 --> 01:03:26,301
we're on our way to enter a seminary

1078
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:28,002
to study for
the priesthood.

1079
01:03:30,038 --> 01:03:31,472
Priesthood?

1080
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:38,513
Maybe that's what
he was trying to say.

1081
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,883
It's hard to believe.

1082
01:03:42,918 --> 01:03:44,852
I mean...

1083
01:03:44,886 --> 01:03:46,387
To be a priest.

1084
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:48,356
I mean...

1085
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:50,925
I don't know
what I mean.

1086
01:03:50,959 --> 01:03:52,360
He told Tony

1087
01:03:52,394 --> 01:03:54,895
he was performing
an act of mercy.

1088
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:56,864
And that must mean you.

1089
01:03:56,898 --> 01:03:59,801
Now, you in turn
must perform your own

1090
01:03:59,835 --> 01:04:01,803
and send him back
upon the path

1091
01:04:01,837 --> 01:04:03,871
to which
he was dedicated,

1092
01:04:03,905 --> 01:04:06,407
and with
the grace of God,

1093
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:08,776
perhaps still is.

1094
01:04:22,057 --> 01:04:23,190
Come in.

1095
01:04:29,064 --> 01:04:30,498
What is this?

1096
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:31,999
You wouldn't have come

1097
01:04:32,033 --> 01:04:34,235
if I had told you
where I was bringing you.

1098
01:04:34,269 --> 01:04:35,803
Francesca
brought you to hear

1099
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,004
some things
you ought to know.

1100
01:04:37,038 --> 01:04:38,305
Please, come in.

1101
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,507
You can hardly
expect me to come in

1102
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:40,708
after our last meeting.

1103
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:42,777
I am sorry for that.

1104
01:04:42,811 --> 01:04:43,911
Please.

1105
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:56,491
Sit down.

1106
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:00,828
I shall be candid.

1107
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:03,330
Two nights ago,
my brother Michel

1108
01:05:03,365 --> 01:05:06,300
was killed by a person
or persons unknown.

1109
01:05:06,334 --> 01:05:08,269
He was dear to me.

1110
01:05:08,303 --> 01:05:10,104
I shall miss him.

1111
01:05:10,138 --> 01:05:12,807
So will his wife
and young daughter.

1112
01:05:12,841 --> 01:05:14,241
You cannot
think it odd

1113
01:05:14,276 --> 01:05:17,812
if I seek to find the
cause of his death,

1114
01:05:17,846 --> 01:05:19,013
and by what hand,

1115
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:22,249
can you,
Mr. Fitzgerald?

1116
01:05:22,284 --> 01:05:23,551
I didn't know
it was your brother.

1117
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:25,352
Odd.

1118
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:28,823
I should have thought
Monica had told you.

1119
01:05:28,857 --> 01:05:30,825
She was,
as a matter of fact,

1120
01:05:30,859 --> 01:05:32,293
very fond
of my brother.

1121
01:05:32,327 --> 01:05:33,795
For a year,
they had seen

1122
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:35,296
each other
a good deal.

1123
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:39,199
What's that got
to do with it?

1124
01:05:39,234 --> 01:05:40,367
She was in my brother's apartment

1125
01:05:40,402 --> 01:05:41,803
when he was shot.

1126
01:05:41,837 --> 01:05:44,739
For reasons known
only to herself,

1127
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:46,340
she refuses
to come forward

1128
01:05:46,374 --> 01:05:47,942
and tell
what she knows.

1129
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:49,343
The reasons are obvious.

1130
01:05:49,377 --> 01:05:52,413
She knows nothing
and she's afraid of you.

1131
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,415
Perhaps, they are
more complicated.

1132
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,451
I propose
to find out.

1133
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:57,885
Where is she?

1134
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,921
I'll never
tell you that.

1135
01:05:59,955 --> 01:06:00,888
Why not?

1136
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,824
She is an accessory
to the fact.

1137
01:06:02,858 --> 01:06:04,258
You are duty bound

1138
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:05,760
to aid in the solution of a crime.

1139
01:06:05,794 --> 01:06:07,662
Yes, you are,
Gregory.

1140
01:06:07,696 --> 01:06:10,798
It's not the police
who want her, Mr. trevelle,

1141
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,099
it's you.

1142
01:06:12,133 --> 01:06:15,169
My brother's death
is a private affair.

1143
01:06:15,203 --> 01:06:17,805
I intend to
handle it privately.

1144
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,807
Perhaps, you will
be kind enough

1145
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,876
to give Monica
a message for me.

1146
01:06:23,378 --> 01:06:25,847
Tell her to be here

1147
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:28,382
at 7:00.

1148
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:32,720
You may go if you like, Mr. Fitzgerald.

1149
01:06:32,754 --> 01:06:34,822
And don't worry, you
will not be followed.

1150
01:06:34,857 --> 01:06:36,290
I am depending
entirely

1151
01:06:36,324 --> 01:06:38,493
on your conscience
and good sense.

1152
01:06:40,195 --> 01:06:41,762
I give my word.

1153
01:06:47,002 --> 01:06:48,836
Good-bye,
francesca.

1154
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:50,237
You meant well.

1155
01:06:50,271 --> 01:06:52,473
But I don't think
I'll see you again.

1156
01:07:04,085 --> 01:07:05,052
Trevelle,

1157
01:07:05,086 --> 01:07:07,788
you said you would
not follow him.

1158
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,256
Certainly,
I said it.

1159
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:11,225
And certainly,
I didn't mean it.

1160
01:07:11,259 --> 01:07:13,828
I've made
a fantastic mistake.

1161
01:07:13,862 --> 01:07:15,162
But, of course.

1162
01:07:15,196 --> 01:07:16,864
You're a woman.

1163
01:07:26,307 --> 01:07:28,242
I've been
waiting for you,

1164
01:07:28,276 --> 01:07:30,277
and hoping
you wouldn't come.

1165
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:32,813
Silly, isn't it?

1166
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:35,816
Monica,
I saw trevelle.

1167
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:37,885
Trevelle?

1168
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:42,790
We've both had
social afternoons.

1169
01:07:42,824 --> 01:07:44,659
How was Mr. trevelle?

1170
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,160
Is it true

1171
01:07:46,194 --> 01:07:47,161
about...

1172
01:07:47,195 --> 01:07:49,430
You and his brother?

1173
01:07:50,832 --> 01:07:53,968
Yes, it's true,
me and his brother.

1174
01:07:54,002 --> 01:07:56,370
Or it was until I found
out he was married.

1175
01:07:56,404 --> 01:07:59,740
You carefully didn't tell
me any of this, did you?

1176
01:07:59,775 --> 01:08:01,676
You didn't lie,

1177
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,878
but all I knew of you was a half-truth.

1178
01:08:03,912 --> 01:08:05,212
Half-truth?

1179
01:08:06,815 --> 01:08:09,650
And what did
I know about you?

1180
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:11,318
Not a tenth
of the truth.

1181
01:08:11,352 --> 01:08:12,820
Not a suspicion of it,

1182
01:08:12,854 --> 01:08:14,789
father Fitzgerald.

1183
01:08:16,291 --> 01:08:19,927
Oh, yes, I saw your father du rocher.

1184
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:23,864
I played Mary magdalene
very prettily.

1185
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,233
Or was it jezebel?

1186
01:08:26,267 --> 01:08:28,302
Whatever it is,

1187
01:08:28,336 --> 01:08:30,838
I interfere
with you no longer.

1188
01:08:33,775 --> 01:08:36,944
You let me fall in love
with you. You know that?

1189
01:08:38,246 --> 01:08:41,949
And I'll bet you 6-2 and
even you're in love with me.

1190
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:43,350
Oh, why did you bother?

1191
01:08:43,384 --> 01:08:45,552
What was in it for you?

1192
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,289
Very happy to have
made your acquaintance.

1193
01:08:49,324 --> 01:08:50,791
I doubt we'll see
each other again.

1194
01:08:50,826 --> 01:08:52,426
We don't play
the same games.

1195
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,628
Oh, yes we do.

1196
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,596
Only we have
different rules.

1197
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:56,797
The way I learned

1198
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,298
is you play until
the game is over.

1199
01:08:58,333 --> 01:08:59,767
We'll get a lawyer,
Monica,

1200
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:01,769
then go
to the police.

1201
01:09:01,803 --> 01:09:03,203
Oh no, we won't.

1202
01:09:03,238 --> 01:09:05,740
You're gonna have a collar
that goes on backwards,

1203
01:09:05,774 --> 01:09:08,442
and I'm gonna
try and survive.

1204
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,249
Looks like the score's gonna
be posted pretty quickly now.

1205
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:16,917
Trevelle's boys
have followed you here.

1206
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,289
He gave me his word.

1207
01:09:22,323 --> 01:09:23,257
Trevelle's word,

1208
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:25,592
not exactly a gilt-edged
security.

1209
01:09:35,303 --> 01:09:36,804
They're back
there, too.

1210
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:38,272
Not much time.
Go over the roof.

1211
01:09:38,306 --> 01:09:39,740
All right,
let's go.

1212
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:42,743
No, I've got a better
chance without you.

1213
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:44,745
You've got
no chance without me.

1214
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:45,880
Come on!

1215
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:13,807
Father,
we need refuge.

1216
01:15:13,841 --> 01:15:15,342
Come with me.

1217
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,236
What can
I do for you?

1218
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:44,804
There's so much
to explain, father.

1219
01:15:44,839 --> 01:15:47,807
You said
you need refuge.

1220
01:15:47,842 --> 01:15:49,609
Yes, father,
for her.

1221
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:10,497
Mademoiselle.

1222
01:16:12,133 --> 01:16:14,334
She'll take
care of you.

1223
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:23,977
Come, sit down.

1224
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:28,348
Are you hungry?

1225
01:16:28,383 --> 01:16:29,516
No, father.

1226
01:16:33,654 --> 01:16:35,556
How can I help you, my son?

1227
01:16:35,590 --> 01:16:36,823
You've already helped,

1228
01:16:36,857 --> 01:16:38,325
more than you know.

1229
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:40,327
Perhaps,
I can help more.

1230
01:16:40,361 --> 01:16:43,497
What are you to
this tragic girl?

1231
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:46,266
Nothing.

1232
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:49,236
Search your heart
and find the truth.

1233
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:52,272
The church asks you
to make your decision

1234
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:54,374
out of
your free will.

1235
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,876
You can still
live and love

1236
01:16:56,911 --> 01:17:00,247
as other men,
my boy.

1237
01:17:00,281 --> 01:17:02,816
There's
no hold on you.

1238
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:04,518
Decide well.

1239
01:17:06,354 --> 01:17:08,722
I have decided.

1240
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:13,760
Come.

1241
01:17:13,794 --> 01:17:16,196
I'll show
you your room.

1242
01:17:41,889 --> 01:17:43,323
Monica.

1243
01:17:43,358 --> 01:17:45,659
This is all
very strange to me.

1244
01:17:46,894 --> 01:17:48,328
My mother and father

1245
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:50,297
used to scrub me up,

1246
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:53,267
try and take me
to Sunday school.

1247
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:55,335
When I cried and didn't want to go,

1248
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,837
they gave up,
and I stayed home.

1249
01:17:57,872 --> 01:18:00,307
They said
it was a sin.

1250
01:18:00,341 --> 01:18:01,808
What is sin?

1251
01:18:01,842 --> 01:18:05,212
The willful breaking
of the law of God.

1252
01:18:05,246 --> 01:18:08,282
Can we be forgiven?

1253
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:09,749
By penance.

1254
01:18:09,784 --> 01:18:14,754
God does not punish the true
penitent here and hereafter.

1255
01:18:14,789 --> 01:18:18,325
Power to forgive sin,
how wonderful.

1256
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:20,093
How wonderful.

1257
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:21,595
There is forgiveness,

1258
01:18:21,629 --> 01:18:23,963
but we must do penance.

1259
01:18:25,833 --> 01:18:28,302
How do you do
penance for...

1260
01:18:28,336 --> 01:18:30,704
Taking the life of
another human being?

1261
01:18:35,776 --> 01:18:38,312
Trevelle didn't
tell you everything.

1262
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:39,313
I...

1263
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:41,781
I killed his brother.

1264
01:18:41,816 --> 01:18:43,817
And he knows it.

1265
01:18:43,851 --> 01:18:46,753
I also loved his brother.

1266
01:18:46,787 --> 01:18:49,323
Let's face it,
I'm not a schoolgirl.

1267
01:18:49,357 --> 01:18:51,825
I wanted any kind of
love he could give me.

1268
01:18:51,859 --> 01:18:53,793
I did not know
he was married.

1269
01:18:53,828 --> 01:18:55,329
That's
the cornball truth.

1270
01:18:55,363 --> 01:18:58,432
And when I found out,
I tried to leave him.

1271
01:18:58,466 --> 01:19:00,234
I met another man.

1272
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:02,569
I had a chance for a new
life with him in London.

1273
01:19:02,604 --> 01:19:04,471
He wanted to marry me.

1274
01:19:04,505 --> 01:19:09,276
Michel destroyed it by
telling him the brutal truth.

1275
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:12,312
My friend wrote me
a terrible letter.

1276
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:13,780
And that was that.

1277
01:19:13,814 --> 01:19:15,749
I'd let you read it,

1278
01:19:15,783 --> 01:19:18,285
only that's
the one trevelle took.

1279
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:22,322
Then I faced Michel
and tried to tell him again

1280
01:19:22,357 --> 01:19:23,790
it was finished, over.

1281
01:19:23,824 --> 01:19:26,326
He wouldn't let me go.

1282
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:27,827
He threatened me,

1283
01:19:27,862 --> 01:19:29,829
meant the threat.

1284
01:19:29,864 --> 01:19:33,300
In escaping, I...

1285
01:19:33,334 --> 01:19:36,436
I shot him
with his own gun.

1286
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:41,775
In any court, Monica,
that's self-defense.

1287
01:19:41,809 --> 01:19:43,777
Trevelle has
the letter and the motive.

1288
01:19:43,811 --> 01:19:45,312
They'll never believe me.

1289
01:19:45,346 --> 01:19:47,046
I believe you.

1290
01:19:49,984 --> 01:19:51,685
Thanks, Gregory.

1291
01:19:53,788 --> 01:19:56,256
Now I'd like
to start being alone.

1292
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,724
You'll
never be alone.

1293
01:19:57,759 --> 01:20:01,428
Whenever I'm afraid,
I'll see your face.

1294
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:04,264
It may be
through your eyes

1295
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,800
what I haven't
seen for so long.

1296
01:20:09,704 --> 01:20:13,307
Would it be all right
if I kissed you?

1297
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,008
It would
be all right.

1298
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:37,831
Good night.

1299
01:20:37,865 --> 01:20:39,899
In the morning,
I'll go for help,

1300
01:20:39,934 --> 01:20:41,034
the police.

1301
01:23:23,564 --> 01:23:24,698
Monica?

1302
01:23:28,903 --> 01:23:30,003
Help me.

1303
01:23:32,072 --> 01:23:35,575
Oh, my God,
I am heartily sorry...

1304
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:36,977
Heartily sorry.

1305
01:23:37,011 --> 01:23:38,478
For having
offended thee,

1306
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:41,080
and I detest
all my sins...

1307
01:23:41,115 --> 01:23:42,348
My sins.

1308
01:23:42,383 --> 01:23:44,851
Because I dread
the loss of heaven

1309
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:46,386
and the pains of hell.

1310
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:47,821
But most of all

1311
01:23:47,855 --> 01:23:49,389
because they offend thee, my God,

1312
01:23:49,423 --> 01:23:52,358
deserving of all my love.

1313
01:23:52,393 --> 01:23:55,361
I firmly resolve with
the help of thy grace

1314
01:23:55,396 --> 01:23:56,863
to confess my sins,
do penance,

1315
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:59,198
and to amend my life.

1316
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:02,335
Amend my life.

1317
01:24:02,369 --> 01:24:03,703
Amen.

1318
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:18,985
This is no small
decision you make.

1319
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:25,191
You not only
choose a way of life,

1320
01:24:25,225 --> 01:24:27,761
you choose a way
of eternity.

1321
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:33,166
What does it mean
to be a priest?

1322
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,169
To live in the midst
of the world

1323
01:24:36,203 --> 01:24:39,773
without wishing
its pleasures.

1324
01:24:39,807 --> 01:24:43,276
To be a member
of each family,

1325
01:24:43,310 --> 01:24:45,979
yet belonging to none.

1326
01:24:46,013 --> 01:24:48,848
To share all suffering.

1327
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:51,885
To penetrate all secrets.

1328
01:24:51,919 --> 01:24:54,487
To heal all wounds.

1329
01:24:54,521 --> 01:24:56,890
To teach and to pardon.

1330
01:24:56,924 --> 01:25:00,293
To console and bless always.
