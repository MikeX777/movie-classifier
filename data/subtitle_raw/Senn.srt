[dark rhythmic music]

00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:24,057
[unintelligible alien dialogue]

4
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:38,088
The final item in our agenda today is
the planetary asset known as Pyom.

5
00:00:38,442 --> 00:00:44,212
This remote backwater was acquired over
800 years ago by our Royddin subsidiary

6
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:47,712
an undeveloped resource-rich
"gem" of a property

7
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:51,052
with the convenience of a
preexisting atmosphere.

8
00:00:51,298 --> 00:00:54,228
After mineral extractions were completed,

9
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:57,312
Pyom was still quite valuable
as a manufacturing base,

10
00:00:57,336 --> 00:01:01,145
boasting a profitability index of 127.

11
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:04,169
Sadly, operations in
Pyom fell victim to

12
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:08,504
the economic collapse in
that system 73 years ago

13
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:12,404
and a freeze on maintenance
expenditure remains in effect.

14
00:01:12,654 --> 00:01:14,654
Compounding the planet's woes,

15
00:01:14,865 --> 00:01:17,472
decades of grade 3
smelting without any

16
00:01:17,497 --> 00:01:20,871
environmental remediation
have taken a toll,

17
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:23,859
and no funds have been
allocated for cleanup.

18
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:28,049
Models are being run for
various divestiture strategies

19
00:01:28,073 --> 00:01:31,517
including both cold pullout and sale,

20
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:35,439
in which case the indigenous labor
force will presumably be included.

21
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:39,273
And now, if there are no questions,
this meeting is adjourned.

22
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,564
You were not chosen.

23
00:02:06,697 --> 00:02:11,599
It was purely coincidental that
the sum total of you was the key.

24
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:20,275
It has begun.

25
00:02:22,716 --> 00:02:24,617
[dark rhythmic music]

26
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,420
Are you OK?

27
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:35,178
I'm fine.

28
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:38,333
- How long have you been here?
- Just a few minutes.

29
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:42,181
I'm glad I got to see
you this morning.

30
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:44,117
They posted my new
schedule for the week-

31
00:02:44,451 --> 00:02:47,443
Mostly nights. But it means
I get to see more of you.

32
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:51,131
- Hope I'm worth it.
- When you're not I'll let you know.

33
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:52,961
[loud buzzer]

34
00:02:53,454 --> 00:02:55,720
Lineup. I have to go get dressed.

35
00:02:57,766 --> 00:03:00,188
Kana, I hate it when you leave.

36
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:01,348
See you in a few days.

37
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:11,370
[atmospheric music]

38
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:43,215

00:04:24,303 --> 00:04:25,303
[music builds]

40
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:43,504
Senn! My favorite wedge maker!

41
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:48,874
- How was your weekend?
- Ahh, same as always.

42
00:04:48,898 --> 00:04:50,898
Working my fingers out
to almost nothing.

43
00:04:51,312 --> 00:04:53,005
Pretty soon you'll have
to call me "Nubby".

44
00:04:53,522 --> 00:04:54,969
- Seriously, though, what
happened to your hands?

45
00:04:54,993 --> 00:04:57,710
- Aww, nothing. Just some new chemical
in the finish coating line.

46
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:59,294
Burns like a nudge rod,

47
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:02,935
but on a brighter side, it
gives me a massive buzz,

48
00:05:02,982 --> 00:05:05,601
and makes me really horny,
so I can't complain.

49
00:05:06,365 --> 00:05:08,738
- That's why I love you, Resh.
Always the optimist.

50
00:05:08,762 --> 00:05:11,404
- It's OK! I've been
showering my considerable

51
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:13,306
charms all over the Crew Chief.

52
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,458
You know she's bound to transfer
to the fluff-line any day now.

53
00:05:16,997 --> 00:05:19,730
I think she likes me. If only she knew...

54
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,208
-She doesn't stand a chance.

55
00:05:21,564 --> 00:05:23,286
Solidarity!

56
00:05:23,311 --> 00:05:25,493
Alright. Oh, before I forget...

57
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:31,087
I've got a certain rare item
for a certain special someone.

58
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:32,298
-You found a copy?

59
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:34,251
How'd you get your hands on one?!

60
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,457
-I've got my ways.

61
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:39,306
- And you sir, are forever in my debt.
- No. Forever is not long enough.

62
00:05:40,081 --> 00:05:42,015
I'll pay you back. I promise.

63
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:44,039
- That smile on your ugly
face is payment enough.

64
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,063
Come on! those widges
won't make themselves.

65
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:53,486

00:05:57,881 --> 00:05:59,256

[changing assembly line noises]

68
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:50,571
[choral music begins]

69
00:07:26,638 --> 00:07:27,786
-Senn, get over here!

70
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:29,985
There's another on for you.

71
00:07:44,842 --> 00:07:46,442
This was not your fault.

72
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:50,583
You didn't deserve this.

73
00:07:51,658 --> 00:07:54,143
None of us deserves this.

74
00:07:55,283 --> 00:07:59,977
But... at least you don't
have to be here anymore.

75
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:10,108
[crashing noise]

76
00:08:11,737 --> 00:08:13,137
[assembly line noise]

77
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:29,388
What's going on with you, Senn?

78
00:08:29,412 --> 00:08:31,183
You don't seem like
yourself lately.

79
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,487
Nothing special.

80
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:34,977
I've been having
these weird dreams.

81
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:38,223
Could be from stress... when's
your next day off?

82
00:08:39,084 --> 00:08:41,358
Our group doesn't get any
until the next prod cycle.

83
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:42,520
Bastards.

84
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:44,364
I knew I'd find you two
love units up here.

85
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:45,475
Hi, Resh.

86
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:47,499
Kana, darling, mind if I join?

87
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:52,131
I brought newfangled snacks.

88
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:53,585
Oh, my favorite kind!

89
00:08:53,788 --> 00:08:54,788
Thanks.

90
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:58,558
Which planet did these come from?

91
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:03,023
Don't know, but I can't stop eating them.

92
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:07,558
What's the prize this time?

93
00:09:07,582 --> 00:09:08,582
Or, is it a comic?

94
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:14,908
No, it says "Personality
test: Put your thumb here."

95
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:18,937
You have an aptitude for...

96
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,997
"animals." Hey, how did
it know I like animals?

97
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,895
Is this one of those
"join a cult" things?

98
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,497
No. I think it's a sneaky way
for them to track what you like

99
00:09:28,522 --> 00:09:30,522
so they can get you to buy more stuff.

100
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:32,472
Sure is wasted on us.

101
00:09:32,496 --> 00:09:33,931
What you love most...

102
00:09:36,057 --> 00:09:37,057
"your family."

103
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,830
Sorry.

104
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:43,112
If only this stupid thing could
tell me where my family is...

105
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,141
I know exactly where mine is.

106
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:49,096
I hear from them all the time.

107
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:52,125
Especially when I'm late
getting them money!

108
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,023
But it's the only thing that keeps them
alive, so, you know, what the hey!

109
00:10:00,358 --> 00:10:03,358
Sorry folks. I don't
have much to contribute.

110
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:06,330
Family has never been
one of my big concerns.

111
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:07,671
[choral music]

112
00:11:14,072 --> 00:11:15,830
At least you don't
have anyone to miss.

113
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:31,246
Huh-I heard there's an ExWorld
passenger transport leaving next week.

114
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,030
ExWorld?

115
00:11:33,648 --> 00:11:36,208
It would take two lifetimes of our
wages just to afford a ticket.

116
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:39,085
Those shuttles are so old they,
they blow up half the time anyway.

117
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,218
And if you can actually
get a ride to another

118
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,267
rock in our system.
They just deport you.

119
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:44,723
Well, I can still dream.

120
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:47,098
I'm gonna find my
sisters someday.

121
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:49,293
We're not going anywhere.

122
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:51,938
All we're good for
is making weird junk

123
00:11:51,963 --> 00:11:53,593
we don't understand
and never afford.

124
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:56,932
That's what fills all the
shuttles that leave here...

125
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,660
off to rich people in other systems.

126
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,687
They probably have no
idea where Pyon even is.

127
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:02,804
Yeah!

128
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:06,077
Yeah. Those suckers probably think
everything they buy is made by robots.

129
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:10,856
Right! For the price of one synbot you
could buy this entire busted planet!

130
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,696
Hmm..We must be good for something else.

131
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:19,379
Ever known anyone to jump
the line and prove it?

132
00:12:19,796 --> 00:12:22,756
Look, you two might not be good for
much, but I tell you what I'm good for.

133
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:28,044
OK? Loving, fighting, scheming
and surviving-in that order.

134
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:30,068
Gotta go, got lots to do...

135
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,122
We should head back soon too.

136
00:12:40,564 --> 00:12:41,727
When can I see you again?

137
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:45,547
I don't know. They keep
changing my shifts.

138
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:50,278
Damn. Guess I'll just
have to miss you, then.

139
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:53,254
I don't know what I'd
do if you didn't.

140
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:58,839
[melancholy piano music]

141
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,347
I hate feeling so broken.

142
00:15:39,127 --> 00:15:40,861
Senn, you should be proud.

143
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:44,323
All the other kids that
get sold are hopeless.

144
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:30,343
Enjoying all the big words?

145
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:33,336
I've been so buried I haven't gotten
a chance to start reading it yet.

146
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,624
You know, most people ask me to smuggle
in perk patches, drama vids, smutlets...

147
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:40,674
You're the only one who wants books.

148
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:44,095
What can I say? I enjoy using my brain.

149
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,797
It's either that or dying of boredom.

150
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:52,197
Hey, listen, I have something to ask you.

151
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
What?

152
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:56,162
You remember that group
that group-mate of mine

153
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:58,342
who was transferred to the
Biohaz about a month ago?

154
00:16:58,366 --> 00:17:00,086
Uhh... the one you liked?
What was his name?

155
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,387
Lann. Yesterday he was
mouthing off about that

156
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:06,216
video they made us watch
for entertainment.

157
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:08,366
I think it was called...

158
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,390
[cheesy sound effects]

159
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:16,190
It's good that we have good the
communication systems we need

160
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:18,885
or else we'd be blown up
just like the other planets.

161
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:30,569
Aha! This is the last
planet we have to blow up!

162
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,913
Now-destroy them!

163
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:35,159
[cheesy laser blast]

164
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:39,489
We will destroy the base by laser cannon.

165
00:17:39,568 --> 00:17:40,568
Good.

166
00:17:40,763 --> 00:17:44,560
[cheesy sound effects]

167
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,626
Red alert! White people in the area!

168
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:56,711
Now, let's go inside and free the slaves!

169
00:17:58,134 --> 00:17:59,915
Looks like it was made
by a 12-year-old!

170
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,939
It was. the head foreman's kid made it.

171
00:18:01,963 --> 00:18:03,198
No wonder!

172
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:05,222
They forced us to watch
that a few days ago.

173
00:18:05,347 --> 00:18:08,565
So ridiculous. Huge spaceships
don't land on planets.

174
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,129
Everybody knows that.

175
00:18:12,276 --> 00:18:14,292
So, what about
Lann... don't tell me...

176
00:18:14,332 --> 00:18:15,761
He's delisted.

177
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:18,245
Aw, that's awful. You must be crushed.

178
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:20,269
Look, you know the crew
chief in Bio, right?

179
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:21,806
Do you think you could
talk to her for me?

180
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,191
I mean, maybe she'll
take him back.

181
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:26,198
I know there's not much
of a chance, but...

182
00:18:26,222 --> 00:18:28,222
[strange metal sounds]

183
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,257
Cuff me! What was that?

184
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,968
You mean you could see it, too?

185
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:36,184
I thought it was just me.

186
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:39,687
If that's the grid shorting out
again, let's get out of here.

187
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:42,550
I do not want to get deep fried
like those guys in Bunk 12.

188
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:44,042
No, it's not that.

189
00:18:44,508 --> 00:18:45,958
I wanna show you something.

190
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,318
Cuff my balls!

191
00:19:09,427 --> 00:19:10,427
What is that?

192
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:11,755
I don't know.

193
00:19:12,037 --> 00:19:13,237
It comes and goes.

194
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:16,732
Whatever you do, don't touch it!

195
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:17,996
Oh, I'm definitely going to touch it.

196
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,803
You really, really shouldn't touch it.

197
00:19:19,827 --> 00:19:21,152
I have to touch it.

198
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:22,424
Resh, do not touch it.

199
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,529
I need to touch it.

200
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,071
[piercing scraping sounds]

201
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:31,095
Ahh!

202
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,734
That's OK. No damage.

203
00:19:36,352 --> 00:19:37,352
What is it?

204
00:19:38,407 --> 00:19:39,407
I wish I knew.

205
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,688
Wait a sec. No, I've seen
something like that before.

206
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:43,193
It was in a spy vid.

207
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,570
Some sort of surveillance device.

208
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:47,108
You're being spied on.

209
00:19:47,132 --> 00:19:49,409
Come on, Resh, those trashy
vids you watch aren't real!

210
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:51,070
It looked exactly like that! I swear!

211
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:54,404
If it is what you say it is, it
certainly isn't well hidden.

212
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,092
No, this is big.

213
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,079
There's got to be some
reason that it's there.

214
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:07,275
[wind noise]

215
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:10,943
[atmospheric music]

216
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,778
How's the book you
got from Resh?

217
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,741
Oh, it's super interesting.

218
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:42,499
There's a character in it with a
job that would be perfect for you.

219
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:43,874
What job?

220
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:47,491
It's a medic for
animals, just animals.

221
00:20:47,515 --> 00:20:50,713
Really?! There are people
who just treat animals?

222
00:20:50,843 --> 00:20:51,843
Apparently so.

223
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:54,400
I'd love to do something like that.

224
00:20:54,893 --> 00:20:56,559
It'd be pretty nice, huh?

225
00:20:58,018 --> 00:20:59,151
Who am I kidding?

226
00:20:59,643 --> 00:21:02,697
The only experience I have with
animals is watching them in vids.

227
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:06,155
I've never even seen a
real animal in person.

228
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,375
I'd be hopeless.

229
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,447
No, you'd be terrific.

230
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:11,112
You're the most caring person I know.

231
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:14,700
Stop it! You're just trying
to make me feel better.

232
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:17,929
Ow.

233
00:21:18,547 --> 00:21:19,547
What is it?

234
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Umm...

235
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:22,711
Umm...

236
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:26,374
Just a sharp pain behind my eyes.

237
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:29,134
Happens now and then.

238
00:21:29,158 --> 00:21:31,217
Do you think it's
related to the...

239
00:21:31,242 --> 00:21:32,899
what did you call them again?

240
00:21:32,923 --> 00:21:34,923
Uhh... I don't know.

241
00:21:34,947 --> 00:21:36,406
Vivid dreams?

242
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,470
I wish I could see them.

243
00:21:37,744 --> 00:21:38,811
You might not want to.

244
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:41,822
I don't know if I should
be afraid of them or not.

245
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:45,803
I've been seeing other things, too...
while I'm awake.

246
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,291
It's starting to worry me.

247
00:21:51,831 --> 00:21:54,497
Well, you've definitely
been dazing out

248
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:55,921
more and more lately.

249
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,532
Pretty soon you're not going to
be able to work, and then...

250
00:22:00,556 --> 00:22:02,180
I can still manage, OK?

251
00:22:02,204 --> 00:22:03,688
You're fooling yourself.

252
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:05,720
They've already had to stop the
line twice because of you,

253
00:22:05,744 --> 00:22:07,700
and if it happens again
they'll throw you out.

254
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:11,163
You have to dig through the trash
dunes with the other discards.

255
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,470
What can I do?

256
00:22:12,494 --> 00:22:13,397
I can't control the visions.

257
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:14,703
I can't stop them
from happening.

258
00:22:20,626 --> 00:22:22,150
Maybe you should see
the group medic?

259
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,790
Medic?

260
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:25,856
I might as well go to the
Foreman and resign right now.

261
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,480
You know what'll happen?

262
00:22:27,574 --> 00:22:29,694
At the third word out of my
mouth about the "visions",

263
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:32,166
that'll be the end of it.

264
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:33,656
They'll brand me unfit.

265
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:37,855
It will be over. And not just
for me, but for both of us.

266
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:40,329
Senn, we have to do something.

267
00:22:40,354 --> 00:22:41,821
I'm worried about you,

268
00:22:41,846 --> 00:22:44,505
you're sick and you don't
seem to be getting better.

269
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,085
Kana, I'm not sick.

270
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:47,890
Alright, I,

271
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:53,077
I know the things I'm seeing
are weird and hard to explain.

272
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:57,154
But, you know, they're important somehow.

273
00:22:58,524 --> 00:22:59,857
It's not a sickness.

274
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:04,210
I just wish I knew what it was all about.

275
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:10,351
All I want is for you to be OK.

276
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:12,967
I care about you.

277
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:15,248
I love you.

278
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,325
I wish I were good at telling
you how much you mean to me.

279
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:28,026
You know, you're about the only
thing in this cuffed up place

280
00:23:28,051 --> 00:23:29,595
that isn't rotting
from the inside out.

281
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,540
I just wish I didn't feel so helpless.

282
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:37,298
We'll figure something out.

283
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:41,568
[music]

284
00:24:46,588 --> 00:24:47,588
What are you?

285
00:24:50,595 --> 00:24:51,992
What do you want from me?

286
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,276
Why are you even here?

287
00:24:57,849 --> 00:24:59,515
What are you waiting for?

288
00:25:00,504 --> 00:25:02,097
Whatever you're here
to do, just do it.

289
00:25:02,122 --> 00:25:03,765
Alright? Just get it
over with already.

290
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:06,647
Just quit hiding and
fucking show yourself!

291
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:12,817
[music continues]

292
00:26:11,448 --> 00:26:12,448
Senn!

293
00:26:13,417 --> 00:26:14,817
Senn, snap out of it!

294
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:16,486
You won't believe this.

295
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:17,577
It was amazing.

296
00:26:18,121 --> 00:26:19,769
I busted through a new part and

297
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:21,354
all of space opened
up in front of me.

298
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:22,800
It all makes sense now.

299
00:26:22,824 --> 00:26:25,469
Forget about that. It's opening
up right here, come on!

300
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:26,843
What?!

301
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,264
[loud booming music]

302
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
Wait!

303
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:53,692
Senn, you're going in to that thing?!

304
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:54,905
I have to, Kana.

305
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,035
Everything that's happened
up to this point,

306
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,699
every cell in my body is saying
that this is the right thing to do.

307
00:27:01,317 --> 00:27:02,488
I want you to come with me.

308
00:27:02,512 --> 00:27:06,001
Go? But we don't know what's in
there or what the hell it even is.

309
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:08,928
Look at it, it goes on
forever in both directions.

310
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,781
It seems crazy, but

311
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:14,455
but I'm asking you to
trust my gut on this one,

312
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:16,256
Alright, remember,
remember when you said

313
00:27:16,281 --> 00:27:17,561
"We'll figure something out.'

314
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:19,301
Things have been figured out!

315
00:27:19,476 --> 00:27:21,143
But this is insane, Senn.

316
00:27:21,656 --> 00:27:22,794
How can this be happening?

317
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:26,159
I don't know exactly, but it has.

318
00:27:28,969 --> 00:27:30,798
It's not something I'm dreaming. It's here.

319
00:27:30,822 --> 00:27:32,423
And it's not a broken
down ExWorld shuttle.

320
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:33,785
You knew this was going to happen?!
You saw it?

321
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:35,809
No, no, I didn't know... But I do now.

322
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:38,197
The goons are coming,
you better go.

323
00:27:38,968 --> 00:27:40,303
[alarm sounding]

324
00:27:41,663 --> 00:27:43,686
Resh is right; if we stay here, we're dead.

325
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:45,975
I can't believe I'm doing this.

326
00:27:47,702 --> 00:27:50,613
Resh, Resh, I want you to join us.
Right, I know...

327
00:27:50,637 --> 00:27:52,723
Senn, my mom...

328
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:04,891
I'm torn up leaving you here, man.

329
00:28:04,915 --> 00:28:07,133
You know me. I'm a fighter.
I'm going to get by.

330
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:10,981
Get that brain of yours out of
here before they wash it for you.

331
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:21,521
Go, go!

332
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:27,600
[music continues]

333
00:29:23,264 --> 00:29:24,264
[music continues]

334
00:30:18,321 --> 00:30:19,321
What is all this?

335
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:20,798
I don't know.

336
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,170
Welc'...

337
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,038
- Who are you?
- Wel-come

338
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:17,327
Welcome.

339
00:31:17,702 --> 00:31:18,990
Make yourselves comfortable.

340
00:31:19,866 --> 00:31:21,452
Ummm, thanks.

341
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:23,432
We'll try.

342
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:26,774
We hope our arrival was
not too disruptive.

343
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:29,034
Only a bit.

344
00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:31,908
This is a space-ship, right?

345
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:33,740
That is correct.

346
00:31:33,943 --> 00:31:36,544
While you are here, please
make yourselves at home.

347
00:31:37,802 --> 00:31:38,802
Sure.

348
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,014
Maybe you should explain
what's going on.

349
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:47,082
We've been tracking
an unknown entity

350
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:50,571
which has reached deeper and
deeper strata within the Polychronom.

351
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:52,710
Levels never reached before.

352
00:31:53,952 --> 00:31:54,952
Polychronom?

353
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:58,429
It's the giant construct I've
been seeing in my dreams.

354
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:00,359
I'm assuming I'm the entity.

355
00:32:00,594 --> 00:32:01,795
Yes, exactly.

356
00:32:02,445 --> 00:32:03,960
So, what is the Polychronom?

357
00:32:04,664 --> 00:32:09,264
We have been studying the "construct",
as you call it, for some time.

358
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:13,305
But, we still do not know its
purpose, or who created it.

359
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:16,339
Wait. You mean you didn't build it?

360
00:32:16,363 --> 00:32:19,775
Oh, no. Our technology is primitive

361
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:22,379
compared to the sophistication
present within the Polychronom.

362
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,790
Incredible!

363
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:28,154
When I'm there in my mind.

364
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:30,641
It feels like I'm trying
to solve something.

365
00:32:31,336 --> 00:32:33,336
But at the same time, I'm not.

366
00:32:33,742 --> 00:32:36,157
It's more like an emotional test.
But...

367
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:38,506
It's hard to explain.

368
00:32:40,183 --> 00:32:41,254
What's going on in there?

369
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:43,946
We hope you can answer that for us.

370
00:32:44,622 --> 00:32:46,450
Entire civilizations
have devoted themselves

371
00:32:46,475 --> 00:32:48,716
to deciphering the Polychronom.

372
00:32:48,974 --> 00:32:51,489
But, none have accomplished
as much as you have.

373
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:54,321
Not to mention, in so little time.

374
00:32:55,093 --> 00:32:58,288
We did not even know in which part of the
galaxy to look for you until recently.

375
00:32:59,101 --> 00:33:01,634
Why Senn? What's so special about him?

376
00:33:02,257 --> 00:33:03,460
That is a mystery as well.

377
00:33:04,272 --> 00:33:08,472
Surprisingly, he is able to connect
to the construct from afar.

378
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:11,756
So why did you come all the way here?

379
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:14,748
We see ourselves as stewards
of the Polychronom.

380
00:33:15,564 --> 00:33:20,087
In that role we desire to aid whomever
the construct chooses to grant access.

381
00:33:20,814 --> 00:33:24,591
I just want to be there. See it
in person, more than anything.

382
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,540
It is a real, physical thing, right?

383
00:33:29,564 --> 00:33:33,292
Yes, it is quite as you say, "real".

384
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:36,606
Do you require rest?

385
00:33:37,627 --> 00:33:40,427
Please, take some time
to get acclimated,

386
00:33:40,845 --> 00:33:42,380
and then we can discuss further.

387
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:46,375
Our voyage will take many of
your days, so there is time.

388
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:49,306
Before you go,

389
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,943
what should we call you?

390
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:52,697
What's your name?

391
00:33:53,142 --> 00:33:55,556
We... have no name.

392
00:33:57,795 --> 00:33:59,126
Did he say his name was "We"?

393
00:34:02,342 --> 00:34:03,404
And I was wondering...

394
00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:05,633
What about a place to sleep?

395
00:34:06,303 --> 00:34:08,630
Food? You know, things like that...

396
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:12,433
Of course. Our apologies.

397
00:34:13,848 --> 00:34:14,848
Will this do?

398
00:34:16,965 --> 00:34:17,965
That'll do.

399
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:20,879
Nicely.

400
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,966
[atmospheric music]

401
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:31,058
[loud crashing sound]

402
00:35:36,478 --> 00:35:37,696
Hi, umm...

403
00:35:39,455 --> 00:35:41,019
This thing you're doing right now-

404
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:43,499
please don't do it again.

405
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,691
To what are you referring?

406
00:35:47,301 --> 00:35:50,917
Standing here, watching
me while I sleep.

407
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:53,493
It's disturbing.

408
00:35:54,816 --> 00:35:55,816
So sorry.

409
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:04,705
Uh, since you're
here, can I ask...

410
00:36:04,826 --> 00:36:06,178
how far is it we'll
be traveling?

411
00:36:07,112 --> 00:36:09,049
The Polychronom is in a
system approximately

412
00:36:09,074 --> 00:36:12,013
1,041 of your light years from
our present location.

413
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:14,765
One-thousand light years? Wow!

414
00:36:15,556 --> 00:36:17,561
The distance is of no
consequence to us.

415
00:36:18,665 --> 00:36:20,489
Can you imagine
the amazing stuff

416
00:36:20,514 --> 00:36:22,981
you could discover with
a spaceship like this?

417
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:25,559
Strange phenomena, undiscovered races!

418
00:36:26,004 --> 00:36:27,731
That is a difficult question to answer.

419
00:36:27,755 --> 00:36:29,816
Oh, it wasn't really a question.
I was just thinking of the possibili-

420
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,399
The cosmos is so vast

421
00:36:31,668 --> 00:36:35,003
that the likelihood of coming across
something of interest is very remote.

422
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,202
And time is even more vast.

423
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:41,712
Almost all of the advanced races we
found evidence of perished long ago.

424
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,658
Oh, well. That's too bad.

425
00:36:46,768 --> 00:36:47,808
I can still dream, though.

426
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:54,265
Hey, Senn, ask for some new clothes for us.

427
00:36:54,352 --> 00:36:55,797
Oh, oh, and some books.

428
00:36:56,688 --> 00:36:57,688
Of course.

429
00:37:04,694 --> 00:37:06,225
Still can't believe this is happening.

430
00:37:06,249 --> 00:37:08,866
Me neither, it's so strange.

431
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:14,915
Well, imagine if we were
transporting insects somewhere.

432
00:37:15,062 --> 00:37:16,062
Right?

433
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,455
We wouldn't have the first clue
to know what would make it happy.

434
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:19,479
True.

435
00:37:25,566 --> 00:37:27,472
I hope Resh is
holding up alright.

436
00:37:29,176 --> 00:37:30,923
He made the right decision to stay behind.

437
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:34,299
He's a tough one. He'll be OK.

438
00:37:35,948 --> 00:37:36,948
You're right.

439
00:37:38,955 --> 00:37:40,428
At least I hope you're right.

440
00:37:54,076 --> 00:37:55,343
What are you doing?

441
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
Cooking.

442
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:04,222
I see... umm... I don't mean to
interrupt but I have a question.

443
00:38:05,262 --> 00:38:07,472
So there is a higher level
part of the construct

444
00:38:07,497 --> 00:38:10,038
that I can't seem to get
past and I don't know why.

445
00:38:10,062 --> 00:38:11,513
Describe it, please.

446
00:38:12,342 --> 00:38:16,231
The shapes there are
tightly packed together,

447
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:18,435
into a sort of wall, and I
can't seem to get around it.

448
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:20,451
Ah, yes.

449
00:38:21,069 --> 00:38:24,608
You are confused because you are not used
to dealing with multi-dimensional space.

450
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,990
Multi-what?

451
00:38:26,647 --> 00:38:29,073
Some of the "shapes",
as you call them,

452
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,433
in that strata exist in
dimensions higher than our own.

453
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:37,064
What you are seeing is not the object
itself, but a shadow of the object.

454
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:38,641
Huh?

455
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:40,079
To explain...

456
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:42,838
Take a two-dimensional object.

457
00:38:43,313 --> 00:38:44,780
For example, a square.

458
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,720
If we introduce a light source onto
the flat plane the square lives in,

459
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:51,222
the resulting shadow is
a one-dimensional line.

460
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:54,926
In the same way, a three-dimensional
object, like a cube,

461
00:38:55,154 --> 00:38:56,893
casts a two-dimensional shadow.

462
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:00,451
Finally, a fourth
dimensional object casts...

463
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:02,584
Casts a three-dimensional shadow!

464
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:03,701
Exactly.

465
00:39:04,236 --> 00:39:06,179
The objects that are
confusing you are

466
00:39:06,204 --> 00:39:08,396
cast shadows of fourth
dimensional volumes.

467
00:39:08,669 --> 00:39:11,902
So how do I tell which
shapes I see are regular,

468
00:39:11,927 --> 00:39:13,642
and which ones are shadows?

469
00:39:14,304 --> 00:39:15,304
It is simple.

470
00:39:15,609 --> 00:39:18,209
Shadows cannot cast
shadows themselves.

471
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,983
I see, so all I need to
do is look for shapes

472
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:22,841
that should be casting
shadows but don't.

473
00:39:23,117 --> 00:39:27,004
Yes. The difference can be subtle.
But it should be noticeable.

474
00:39:27,918 --> 00:39:32,489
Be cautious though-shadow
shapes are inherently unstable.

475
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:33,847
Thank you.

476
00:39:48,848 --> 00:39:50,381
It's so beautiful here.

477
00:39:52,153 --> 00:39:54,105
I don't care if it's not real.

478
00:39:56,237 --> 00:39:57,757
I bet you're thrilled
with the animals.

479
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,347
Yeah, but honestly the big
ones kind of scare me.

480
00:40:03,924 --> 00:40:06,103
Uh. Home feels so far away.

481
00:40:07,953 --> 00:40:09,621
I can't even imagine
going back there.

482
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:13,009
We would have been
blacklisted by now, anyway.

483
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:16,109
There'd be nothing
to go back to,

484
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,633
except digging through the
trash dunes for food scraps.

485
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,562
The factories should be smashed.

486
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,645
What they do, or more so,
how they do it is immoral.

487
00:40:26,669 --> 00:40:29,135
Yeah, but to be replaced by what?

488
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:33,286
Some other entity that exploits
people like us in the same way?

489
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:35,669
There must be
something we can do.

490
00:40:36,621 --> 00:40:37,621
I don't know.

491
00:40:38,683 --> 00:40:39,883
Give it some time.

492
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,323
Did you ever think you'd be
traveling in a massive spaceship

493
00:40:44,348 --> 00:40:46,957
to a strange construct a
thousand light-years away?

494
00:40:48,636 --> 00:40:50,570
Clearly, anything's possible.

495
00:40:56,531 --> 00:40:58,463
You always know how to
make me feel better.

496
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,226
[emotional electronic music]

497
00:42:45,469 --> 00:42:46,469
[music continues]

498
00:43:32,372 --> 00:43:33,372
Would you like some?

499
00:43:33,942 --> 00:43:34,942
Yeah.

500
00:43:35,934 --> 00:43:36,934
Sure.

501
00:43:39,638 --> 00:43:40,638
Cow juice?

502
00:43:41,817 --> 00:43:42,817
Um...

503
00:43:42,888 --> 00:43:43,888
OK.

504
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:44,912
Alright.

505
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:51,838
I was wondering, and I
hope it isn't rude, but

506
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,136
I assume this isn't your natural form.

507
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:56,868
What do you really look like?

508
00:43:57,511 --> 00:43:58,711
It is complicated.

509
00:43:59,316 --> 00:44:01,481
There is a physical
component to our being but

510
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:03,256
it is only visible
in the part of the

511
00:44:03,281 --> 00:44:05,444
electromagnetic spectrum
your eyes cannot see.

512
00:44:06,154 --> 00:44:08,087
If artificially shifted down,

513
00:44:08,111 --> 00:44:11,442
it would appear to you as noise, or static.

514
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,501
It was worth a try.

515
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:19,601
How did you first come
across the Polychronom?

516
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,900
Long ago,

517
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:25,001
we discovered an object in the center
of the iron core of our home land.

518
00:44:25,681 --> 00:44:28,759
It was communicating with
thousands of objects like it.

519
00:44:29,493 --> 00:44:32,063
We followed this complex signal web

520
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:34,087
until we reached the Polychronom.

521
00:44:34,783 --> 00:44:37,384
Once there, we discovered
evidence of others

522
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:39,694
who had attempted to unlock its secrets.

523
00:44:40,296 --> 00:44:43,625
But by the time we arrived,
they had long perished.

524
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:45,454
And no one knows what it's for?

525
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:48,974
There are many hypotheses,
but no certainty.

526
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,579
We assume it is essentially
in a dormant state.

527
00:44:52,832 --> 00:44:55,157
Waiting. For reasons unknown.

528
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,464
Why are you so fascinated with it?

529
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:00,464
In our travels,

530
00:45:00,887 --> 00:45:02,639
we've never come across anything

531
00:45:02,664 --> 00:45:05,401
as advanced or as intriguing
as the Polychronom.

532
00:45:06,014 --> 00:45:10,748
We feel that studying it is worth the
dedication of unlimited time and resources

533
00:45:12,164 --> 00:45:15,055
Sounds like you almost worship it
and you don't even know what it is.

534
00:45:15,938 --> 00:45:17,891
Haven't you ever thought about
the fact that you might end up

535
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:20,640
like all the others and their
dead ships floating around it?

536
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:25,551
This concept is not one
we have contemplated.

537
00:45:27,742 --> 00:45:30,262
Aren't you scared that it might
be some sort of powerful weapon?

538
00:45:30,742 --> 00:45:33,102
Seems risky to tinker with
things you don't understand.

539
00:45:33,126 --> 00:45:34,602
It's not a weapon.

540
00:45:35,555 --> 00:45:37,619
Don't ask me how I
know, but I just do.

541
00:45:38,704 --> 00:45:39,704
I don't know,

542
00:45:39,985 --> 00:45:42,898
something that powerful could
easily convince us into thinking...

543
00:45:43,758 --> 00:45:44,758
anything.

544
00:45:45,596 --> 00:45:49,150
We feel that possible scientific
advancements outweigh any risks.

545
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:53,351
Just be careful, Senn.

546
00:45:57,567 --> 00:45:58,884
[bright, atmospheric music]

547
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:01,929
[bright, atmospheric music]

548
00:48:18,132 --> 00:48:19,132
Hey, Kanna!

549
00:48:19,976 --> 00:48:20,976
Wow!

550
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,180
Senn, do you think it's
OK for us to go in there?

551
00:48:26,924 --> 00:48:28,595
I think all this stuff's here for us.

552
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,067
What do you think this place is?

553
00:48:58,087 --> 00:48:59,532
I think it's someone's house.

554
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:03,354
Or, more accurately, a
copy of someone's house.

555
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,633
What? What's wrong?

556
00:49:49,008 --> 00:49:51,142
These are Manufactory documents.

557
00:49:53,945 --> 00:49:55,352
Internal memos...

558
00:49:55,376 --> 00:49:56,455
Let me see.

559
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:03,350
What's that one about?

560
00:50:05,662 --> 00:50:06,662
It's umm...

561
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:14,744
It's about, acquisition
of, labor resources.

562
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:19,778
Oh, that.

563
00:50:22,013 --> 00:50:24,470
It says the practice has
been banned in two systems

564
00:50:24,495 --> 00:50:27,630
because of what
happened-the abuses.

565
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:33,040
I can't even imagine how
horrific it must have been.

566
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:38,140
They wanted workers who were
fastest and most compliant.

567
00:50:38,893 --> 00:50:42,290
You know, one that were a good
return on their investments

568
00:50:43,428 --> 00:50:46,717
So they'd drill us all day long
on how quickly we could assemble a widge.

569
00:50:47,717 --> 00:50:48,972
How well we followed orders.

570
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:54,568
Ones who weren't so good
at it got the yoke, or were beaten.

571
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,153
Ones who couldn't never
meet the standard

572
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:00,898
always mysteriously came
down with Dramatic Fever,

573
00:51:01,813 --> 00:51:02,875
and they were gone.

574
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:08,478
The worst thing they ever did
was pit us against each other.

575
00:51:09,314 --> 00:51:12,384
The one tiny ray of light were the
friendships I made with the other kids,

576
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:13,909
but they had to go
poison this too.

577
00:51:16,522 --> 00:51:18,970
If there's one thing I learned
there it's that hating is easy-

578
00:51:20,655 --> 00:51:22,655
it's kindness that takes guts.

579
00:51:25,194 --> 00:51:26,594
When did you get out?

580
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,184
At 12 we graduated
into the work-force.

581
00:51:30,537 --> 00:51:32,804
Shifts on the line were a
vacation in comparison.

582
00:51:40,304 --> 00:51:42,147
I wish there was something I could do.

583
00:51:43,734 --> 00:51:45,000
It was so long ago.

584
00:51:45,024 --> 00:51:46,231
You don't need to do anything.

585
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:51,337
Let's just enjoy being here, now.

586
00:51:56,785 --> 00:51:57,985
[foreboding music]

587
00:53:06,637 --> 00:53:07,637
Senn!

588
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,074
Senn-are you OK?

589
00:53:13,241 --> 00:53:15,211
I thought I lost you there for a minute.

590
00:53:16,881 --> 00:53:17,881
I don't know.

591
00:53:19,647 --> 00:53:21,047
I don't know anymore.

592
00:53:22,812 --> 00:53:25,764
You're back. For now.

593
00:53:26,702 --> 00:53:28,416
Come on, we're going
to be late for dinner.

594
00:53:28,796 --> 00:53:29,796
Wait, dinner?

595
00:53:30,398 --> 00:53:33,611
Yeah, We's making some
sort of special meal. Here.

596
00:53:33,636 --> 00:53:36,221
Oh, great! I've seen his cooking.

597
00:53:36,245 --> 00:53:37,797
I'm keeping an open mind.

598
00:54:05,594 --> 00:54:06,594
Fish or bird?

599
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:08,390
Fish.

600
00:54:14,474 --> 00:54:15,474
Fish or bird?

601
00:54:15,498 --> 00:54:16,911
Umm... bird.

602
00:54:25,247 --> 00:54:26,363
Please, enjoy.

603
00:54:27,294 --> 00:54:28,898
We hope the food does not disappoint.

604
00:54:31,512 --> 00:54:34,207
Uh, thank you for... cooking.

605
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:35,796
Yeah, thank you.

606
00:54:36,081 --> 00:54:37,347
It is our pleasure.

607
00:54:39,018 --> 00:54:40,952
Oh, um... I was wondering....

608
00:54:41,229 --> 00:54:44,296
about the others before
me who had the dreams...

609
00:54:45,788 --> 00:54:47,467
were they OK mentally afterwards?

610
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:49,997
Did they experience any... problems?

611
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,358
We have never
encountered any being

612
00:54:52,383 --> 00:54:54,374
who has accessed the
Polychronom before you.

613
00:54:54,796 --> 00:54:57,717
I thought you'd met others,
who didn't get as far as Senn.

614
00:54:58,508 --> 00:55:01,344
We have been able to recover and
analyze several data archives

615
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:03,369
from the dead ships that
surround the construct.

616
00:55:03,899 --> 00:55:05,459
They tell of those who
had your ability.

617
00:55:06,061 --> 00:55:09,787
But the data was difficult
to decipher, and incomplete.

618
00:55:12,748 --> 00:55:19,467
Oh, um, well, did the records
mention any issues they had?

619
00:55:23,177 --> 00:55:24,177
I'm afraid so.

620
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:27,251
It appears that some of those
who were able to access

621
00:55:27,276 --> 00:55:30,786
the Polychronum experienced
mental disintegration.

622
00:55:32,388 --> 00:55:33,388
What?

623
00:55:35,388 --> 00:55:37,367
But you said some. Not all.

624
00:55:38,493 --> 00:55:41,890
No. Not all. The rest died.

625
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:45,297
They died?! Why didn't you
tell me that before?

626
00:55:45,321 --> 00:55:46,945
Can't you do anything to help him?

627
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,476
There was not much we can do.

628
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,197
As we do not fully understand
the processes of work.

629
00:55:52,297 --> 00:55:54,648
If you would allow us to
temporarily remove your brain

630
00:55:54,673 --> 00:55:56,102
we could develop a more
detailed analysis.

631
00:55:56,126 --> 00:55:57,281
No, please do not do that!

632
00:55:57,305 --> 00:55:58,140
Are you serious?

633
00:55:58,164 --> 00:55:59,528
It is a simple procedure.

634
00:55:59,977 --> 00:56:01,989
How could you even suggest
something like that?

635
00:56:02,454 --> 00:56:03,586
Who do you think you are?

636
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,414
We have, arrived.

637
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:22,020
[atmospheric music]

638
00:56:57,156 --> 00:56:58,156
Wow.

639
00:56:58,955 --> 00:57:01,236
For a day or so I felt the
presence more strongly,

640
00:57:01,807 --> 00:57:03,283
the connection more tangible.

641
00:57:04,268 --> 00:57:06,369
At first I thought I was
just going crazy, but now...

642
00:57:06,994 --> 00:57:08,275
now it all makes sense.

643
00:57:08,674 --> 00:57:10,595
I wish I could have seen
this from the beginning.

644
00:57:11,018 --> 00:57:12,192
I might have understood.

645
00:57:12,216 --> 00:57:14,772
Oh, there was no way for you to have known.

646
00:57:16,371 --> 00:57:17,771
So what do we do now?

647
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:21,441
Get into some sort of
shuttle and fly into it?

648
00:57:21,824 --> 00:57:22,824
No.

649
00:57:23,175 --> 00:57:24,987
The physical structure of the Polychronum

650
00:57:25,011 --> 00:57:27,011
fluctuates to violently for travel within.

651
00:57:27,606 --> 00:57:30,463
It is much better to access
it from a safe distance.

652
00:57:31,621 --> 00:57:32,621
I agree.

653
00:57:34,106 --> 00:57:35,644
I think I have a lot of work to do.

654
00:57:36,301 --> 00:57:38,214
Any suggestions on how
I should continue?

655
00:57:38,511 --> 00:57:40,472
We wish we could be of more assistance.

656
00:57:40,683 --> 00:57:43,667
But we have no knowledge of the
advanced strata you have reached.

657
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:46,821
That's OK. I'll figure it out myself.

658
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,103
[music continues]

659
00:58:28,211 --> 00:58:29,211
Resh!

660
00:58:29,399 --> 00:58:33,342
Country A invades Country B vowing
to wipe out all its inhabitants.

661
00:58:33,914 --> 00:58:36,581
Which country is good
and which is evil?

662
00:58:36,605 --> 00:58:37,234
What?

663
00:58:37,258 --> 00:58:40,148
Country B 50 years earlier
colonized its current lands

664
00:58:40,172 --> 00:58:42,422
decimating the native
population in the process,

665
00:58:42,446 --> 00:58:43,945
Now, which is good and which is evil?

666
00:58:43,969 --> 00:58:44,758
Both, I guess.

667
00:58:44,782 --> 00:58:47,951
Millions are dying on a
planet because of drought-

668
00:58:47,975 --> 00:58:48,859
do you help them?

669
00:58:48,883 --> 00:58:49,770
Yes, of course.

670
00:58:49,795 --> 00:58:51,848
What if the draught is
caused by overpopulation?

671
00:58:51,872 --> 00:58:53,145
Oh, uh...

672
00:58:53,169 --> 00:58:56,854
Should holy books be an acceptable source
for determining a society's moral code?

673
00:58:56,878 --> 00:58:59,300
What about ones that contains
rules for keeping slaves?

674
00:58:59,325 --> 00:58:59,908
I don't know.

675
00:58:59,933 --> 00:59:02,400
-Could the conditions ever
exist where the extiction

676
00:59:02,425 --> 00:59:04,704
of a civilization is
preferable to its survival?

677
00:59:04,728 --> 00:59:07,382
If an artificial intelligence
is indistinguishable

678
00:59:07,407 --> 00:59:10,372
from a person, it it murder
to erase it or shut it down?

679
00:59:10,396 --> 00:59:11,678
An artificial what?

680
00:59:14,876 --> 00:59:17,191
You did whatever the
guards wanted even though

681
00:59:17,216 --> 00:59:19,874
you knew it would make life
harder for the other kids.

682
00:59:19,898 --> 00:59:21,319
You were the guards' pet.

683
00:59:21,946 --> 00:59:24,048
And then you pretended to
be friends with everyone

684
00:59:24,073 --> 00:59:25,848
as you knifed them in the back.

685
00:59:25,872 --> 00:59:26,555
What did you say?

686
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,809
To get special treatment

687
00:59:27,834 --> 00:59:30,651
you would even take the jobs
that no one else wanted.

688
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:32,830
like helping to get rid
of all those bodies.

689
00:59:32,854 --> 00:59:34,203
It wasn't like that.

690
00:59:34,689 --> 00:59:38,874
Do you know why you agreed to do
every filthy thing that they wanted?

691
00:59:39,751 --> 00:59:41,418
Because you felt nothing.

692
00:59:42,578 --> 00:59:46,912
You looked at those bodies and you
felt a big fat emotional zero.

693
00:59:47,992 --> 00:59:49,259
You're dead inside.

694
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:53,376
You're a fraud.
You're a failure.

695
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:58,924
You left your best friend
behind on a hideous planet.

696
01:00:00,203 --> 01:00:02,156
Left him to rot.

697
01:00:14,657 --> 01:00:21,580
Resh, Resh, Resh, if you're in
there somewhere, I'm sorry.

698
01:00:22,935 --> 01:00:25,778
I'm not proud of what I did. OK?

699
01:00:27,567 --> 01:00:29,708
If I could go back and
change things I would!

700
01:00:30,489 --> 01:00:32,090
Resh, I would do anything for you.

701
01:00:33,287 --> 01:00:37,153
If saving your life meant losing

01:14:03,014 --> 01:14:04,552
We should not have
tried to stop you.

879
01:14:05,365 --> 01:14:07,349
You were just doing what
you thought was right.

880
01:14:12,126 --> 01:14:14,047
Now that the Polychronom
has been awakened,

881
01:14:14,071 --> 01:14:16,071
we have much research to do.

882
01:14:16,509 --> 01:14:19,454
Do you know of any way we may connect
to it directly, as you have?

883
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,993
Please. It is very important to us.

884
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:28,463
When I was in there I discovered why
you were not able to access it.

885
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:32,393
Because of the function
that it was designed for,

886
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:36,502
it only recognises biological life forms.

887
01:14:39,574 --> 01:14:40,714
But that means...

888
01:14:40,739 --> 01:14:43,912
Yeah.Since your physical
composition isn't biological,

889
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,245
The Polychronom doesn't
even know you exist.

890
01:14:47,818 --> 01:14:49,284
[scary rumbling sound]

891
01:14:50,224 --> 01:14:53,106
So many thousands of
lifetimes, wasted.

892
01:14:55,372 --> 01:14:58,130
The object we have devoted
our entire existance to

893
01:14:59,376 --> 01:15:03,643
has no idea who we are, or
what we have sacrificed?

894
01:15:04,986 --> 01:15:05,986
I'm sorry.

895
01:15:10,165 --> 01:15:12,891
This cannot be understood!

896
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:20,709
[fires burning, rumbling]

897
01:15:33,112 --> 01:15:34,354
I, I want to help but

898
01:15:34,379 --> 01:15:35,838
I don't know what, I
don't know what to do.

899
01:15:42,694 --> 01:15:47,302
If, uh, wait, if he
can create animals,

900
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:50,699
why doesn't he create some sort of
biological component to his behavior?

901
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:56,740
[bright rhythmic music]

902
01:15:58,898 --> 01:15:59,898
Of course!

903
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,280
Um...

904
01:16:05,313 --> 01:16:07,492
Here, this might help.

905
01:16:12,059 --> 01:16:13,192
[music continues]

906
01:16:26,617 --> 01:16:29,839
Do you think We going as an
animal is going to work?

907
01:16:30,905 --> 01:16:33,443
I have no idea. But come on,

908
01:16:33,857 --> 01:16:35,939
let's go get Resh and
find your sisters.

909
01:16:45,013 --> 01:16:47,080
[unintelligeble alien dialogue]

910
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:52,608
I appreciate everyone assembling for
this meeting in such short notice.

911
01:16:53,295 --> 01:16:57,029
As you can imagine, the recent
psychological phenomenom,

912
01:16:57,053 --> 01:17:00,738
which I can confirm all our
subsidiaries are experiencing,

913
01:17:01,470 --> 01:17:03,536
necessitaded this unusual step.

914
01:17:04,681 --> 01:17:08,671
It appears the automated forecasting
systems we always relied on

915
01:17:08,782 --> 01:17:10,582
are no longer useful to us.

916
01:17:11,087 --> 01:17:13,087
We are in uncharted territory.

917
01:17:14,403 --> 01:17:15,918
In view of this development,

918
01:17:16,042 --> 01:17:18,233
we all agree we need to decide quickly

919
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:21,138
about managing our populated
planetary holdings

920
01:17:21,162 --> 01:17:23,363
and living conditions
for their inhabitants.

921
01:17:23,965 --> 01:17:27,602
Contact has even been established with
regional persons' rights organizations

922
01:17:27,626 --> 01:17:30,627
to explore more sustainable options.

923
01:17:31,489 --> 01:17:32,756
For the time being,

924
01:17:32,780 --> 01:17:37,084
all neew acquisitions will be
limited to uninhabited worlds.

925
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:40,254
I share the apprehension
I feel from you all

926
01:17:40,279 --> 01:17:42,442
about the economics
of this new reality

927
01:17:42,966 --> 01:17:45,232
but also in your collected relief

928
01:17:45,256 --> 01:17:47,845
that policy changes are being investigated.

929
01:17:48,645 --> 01:17:52,645
Thank you for your thoughtful
participation in this process.

930
01:17:52,879 --> 01:17:54,879
The floor is now open for discussion.
