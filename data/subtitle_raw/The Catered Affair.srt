1
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:38,835
Morning, Tom. How's the taxi business?
- How's the bridge business?

2
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:40,847
One more day like this,
I'll own the bridge.

3
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:02,432
Hurley. You driving nights?

4
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:04,683
Last one this week.
Check the carburettor, can you.

5
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:06,108
How's the folks?
- Okay.

6
00:02:06,763 --> 00:02:08,460
Sam Leiter was asking for you.
- Oh?

7
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:17,561
Hey, anybody seen Sam Leiter?
- Over there.

8
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:19,706
Sam.
- What?

9
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:21,358
You looking for me?

10
00:02:22,889 --> 00:02:24,809
We got it.
- Got what?

11
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:27,809
This.

12
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:31,742
It's old McQuade's. He's selling it.

13
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:35,861
All he's asking is eight thousand.

14
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:38,693
You know, the medallion
goes with the cab.

15
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,162
We chip in four thousand a piece.

16
00:02:41,921 --> 00:02:43,002
We got a business.

17
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:52,635
What's the matter?

18
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,955
Nothing, nothing.
- Don't you like it?

19
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:56,670
No. It looks fine. Looks fine.

20
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,311
What's the matter?

21
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,427
For twelve years we've
been saving and waiting.

22
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,023
Yeah.

23
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,273
It's a long time.

24
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:07,709
Yep.

25
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,702
I'll be over Sunday.

26
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:12,870
McQuade wants a thousand dollars down.

27
00:03:13,476 --> 00:03:15,493
Five hundred from you and
five hundred from me, huh?

28
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:16,895
Okay?

29
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,426
Yeah.

30
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:24,048
Yeah, okay.
- I'll be over Sunday.

31
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:29,509
Sunday.

32
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,068
Morning, Mr Hurley.
Just getting home from work?

33
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:52,979
Yep.

34
00:03:53,272 --> 00:03:55,587
You didn't see by any
chance my cat, Angelo?

35
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,603
You know. The pink one?
- No.

36
00:03:57,855 --> 00:04:00,424
Hmm. He's a tramp. I feed him.

37
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:02,388
The pleasure, he gives somebody else.

38
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:06,792
I saw Janie last night coming home late.

39
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:09,214
With a fellow with eyeglasses.

40
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,831
Angelo.

41
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,098
Is that you, Tom?

42
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,135
Who else would it be?

43
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:25,207
I didn't beat the dawn.

44
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:27,807
I didn't sleep so good myself.

45
00:04:28,822 --> 00:04:31,399
If I beat the dawn,
I can get some sleep.

46
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:33,618
Now look at the light coming in.

47
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:36,722
Wear one of them things like
whatsisname who works nights.

48
00:04:37,134 --> 00:04:38,631
Over your eyes. You know.

49
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:41,311
Out to Idlewild this
fare wanted me to go.

50
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,076
So I says look, I work uptown.

51
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,457
He says: so what, you're
a cab driver ain't you?

52
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:47,256
So?

53
00:04:47,785 --> 00:04:50,563
I said, maybe I am. But you can
get many a hack going your way.

54
00:04:52,054 --> 00:04:54,881
So he said he'd call a cop
and I told him to go ahead.

55
00:04:55,266 --> 00:04:55,852
So?

56
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:59,740
So I drove to Idlewild and
that broke the back of the night.

57
00:05:00,574 --> 00:05:02,638
Anyway, it's my last
day of working nights.

58
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:04,919
Look at that ice. Caked solid.

59
00:05:05,257 --> 00:05:08,859
No. No new contrivances in this
house until after I have my own hack.

60
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:11,634
I didn't say nothing about a new icebox.

61
00:05:15,204 --> 00:05:17,552
Hello, Pop. Who's in the bathroom?

62
00:05:18,344 --> 00:05:19,448
Your uncle Jack.

63
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:23,871
Eddie up yet?
- Yeah. He's up.

64
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:26,525
I heard you coming home late last night.

65
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:27,717
You were where?

66
00:05:28,296 --> 00:05:29,998
With Ralph. We went
to see Father Murphy.

67
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:31,543
Father Murphy, now.

68
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:35,970
Ma.
- Yeah?

69
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:38,567
Ma.

70
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:42,824
Ralph and I are getting married.

71
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:48,150
Well Jane, that's very nice.

72
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:54,579
Well, what finally decided us was
Ralph has a friend in California, but ..

73
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:56,303
His wife is pregnant so ..

74
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,175
He asked Ralph if he knew someone
who can drive his car out for him as ..

75
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:01,766
He can't drive it out himself
because his wife is pregnant.

76
00:06:02,383 --> 00:06:06,042
Ralph decided quickly we can make a nice
honeymoon out of a trip to California.

77
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:09,338
Tom, your daughter's getting married.
- I'm not deaf, Aggie.

78
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:11,475
Jane, that's very nice.

79
00:06:11,976 --> 00:06:14,791
Anyway, Ralph finishes his school
term on November 3rd. That's tomorrow.

80
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:17,388
That's just three weeks before
he starts the winter session.

81
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:19,832
He's teaching the regular
winter session this year, so ..

82
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:22,413
We decided both of us that
November 6th was just perfect.

83
00:06:22,636 --> 00:06:23,909
So did Father Murphy and ..

84
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:26,770
He's announcing the banns this Sunday
at Mass and got us a dispensation.

85
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:29,825
We must invite his parents for dinner.
- Father Murphy's?

86
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:31,837
No, Ralph's. Mr and Mrs Halloran.
- Oh.

87
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:33,350
Give me the salt and pepper.

88
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,578
I know it's short notice.
But how about tonight?

89
00:06:35,788 --> 00:06:37,318
Can we have them for dinner tonight?

90
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:40,029
It's Friday.
I go to the fish market anyway.

91
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:43,505
Tonight alright with you, Pa?
- Huh? Oh it's fine. Fine with me, Jane.

92
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:45,309
I'm through in the bathroom.

93
00:06:45,965 --> 00:06:46,932
Alright, Jack.

94
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,047
Listen, I'll call Ralph and have him
bring them over around seven.

95
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,132
And Ma, don't go to extra trouble.

96
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:54,765
Just fish and potatoes like we
always have on Friday nights.

97
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:56,327
In fact.

98
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:59,234
One thing I must get straight now.
There isn't going to be a big wedding.

99
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:01,986
Just a plain, simple ceremony.
- That's the best way, Jane.

100
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:03,668
No wedding reception, no nothing.

101
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,842
We want to get an
early start for California.

102
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,778
Whole thing will only take ten minutes.
- That's the best way of all, Jane.

103
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:10,546
No wedding reception, no nothing.

104
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:13,431
You don't want the fuss and feathers
that goes with all these big weddings.

105
00:07:13,772 --> 00:07:17,673
Cousin John said it cost him $3,000 to
give his daughter Caroline her wedding.

106
00:07:19,635 --> 00:07:22,345
Well Jane, if it's a small wedding
you want, that's what you'll have.

107
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:25,968
$3,000 for a wedding breakfast.
Why, it's enough to chill your blood.

108
00:07:26,936 --> 00:07:30,334
To take advantage of a honeymoon and car
we must get married by November the 6th.

109
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:31,550
Next Tuesday.

110
00:07:31,794 --> 00:07:33,468
Well Jane, that's very sensible of you.

111
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:38,159
Anyway, your Pa and me thought we'd
give you a check for five hundred.

112
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:40,971
Five hundred?
- For heaven's sake, Tom.

113
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:43,053
Your one living daughter
is getting married.

114
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:46,431
It would cost you more than five hundred
if she wanted a reception party.

115
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:47,705
I didn't say no.

116
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:50,984
We always said we'd give the kid a
check but never specified a figure.

117
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,211
Please, we don't want no checks.

118
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:54,727
We just want to get married.

119
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:58,167
So, November 6 at St Augustine's.
Just you two and Eddie, and ..

120
00:07:58,628 --> 00:08:00,590
And Ralph's mother and
father and I'll ask Alice.

121
00:08:01,072 --> 00:08:03,581
Because I was her Maid of Honor and
the thing takes only ten minutes.

122
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,583
You'll have to ask your uncle Jack.

123
00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:07,655
Now if we ask uncle Jack, then ..

124
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:10,091
We must invite uncle Harry and aunt ..

125
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:12,216
But he lives right here
in the house with us.

126
00:08:12,571 --> 00:08:14,659
Ma, just the immediate families.

127
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,654
I'd like to ask uncle Jack but if
we do the others will be mad.

128
00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:19,246
I suppose you're right.

129
00:08:19,597 --> 00:08:22,633
If you ask one you're stuck with a
bundle. That means having a big party.

130
00:08:23,234 --> 00:08:25,704
You'd better let me tell him.
Jack's a touchy man.

131
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:35,229
Going to bed.

132
00:08:42,503 --> 00:08:43,147
Jane.

133
00:08:44,597 --> 00:08:45,841
We'll see you tonight, Pa.

134
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:49,438
Yeah.

135
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,066
Goodnight.

136
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:04,070
Jane, it's ..
- Eddie should be here tonight.

137
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,926
I hope he hasn't a date or anything.

138
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:09,070
Jane, it's a big thing getting married.

139
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:10,442
What?

140
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,120
I said it's a big thing.

141
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:14,849
Getting married to somebody.

142
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,473
Why sure it is.

143
00:09:17,344 --> 00:09:18,781
You got to prepare for it.

144
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,993
What do you mean 'prepare'?

145
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,890
I was just saying, marriage
isn't all roses you know.

146
00:09:25,668 --> 00:09:27,199
Who on earth ever said it was?

147
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,320
You got to look before you leap.

148
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:33,307
Ma, I've known Ralph three years.

149
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:35,457
I wasn't saying you
didn't know him alright.

150
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:39,331
I'm just saying marriage is a big thing,
like some girls don't know nowadays.

151
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:41,213
You got to make sacrifices.

152
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:43,104
When the children start coming.

153
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:45,361
You have to put them
first ahead of everybody.

154
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:48,225
I know, Ma.
- You can't go throwing money around.

155
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,139
I hope you got more than your
Pa and me, but if you don't ..

156
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:52,913
Don't go throwing it around.

157
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:54,007
No, Ma.

158
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:57,705
And then one day you'll find
out a lot of time has gone by.

159
00:09:58,489 --> 00:10:01,704
And you'll wake up knowing this
is the way it's always going to be.

160
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:02,944
Just like this.

161
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,310
Day after day. Year after year.

162
00:10:05,765 --> 00:10:06,684
Just the same.

163
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:09,048
And that's why.

164
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:11,128
Being married is such a big thing.

165
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:14,215
The same thing over and over?

166
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:15,764
What's wrong with that?

167
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:17,534
What do you expect, a bed of roses?

168
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,222
Ma, I'm only saying what you said.

169
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:22,891
And don't get married thinking
it's only a good time.

170
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:25,794
It's not a bad time
but it's not a good time.

171
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:29,898
Living all your life with one man and
struggling to raise the children decent.

172
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,018
And don't go running around
staying out late at night in bars.

173
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:35,966
Like so many do nowadays.
- Ralph and me like staying home.

174
00:10:36,224 --> 00:10:37,914
Oh and mind your temper.

175
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,130
Don't let nothing get
you down no matter what.

176
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,782
You got to give and take.

177
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,236
Ma, those are all the things you
<i>don't</i> do. But what do you <i>do?</i>

178
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:47,332
I mean, what do you do
when you're married?

179
00:10:49,037 --> 00:10:50,718
What do you mean, what do you do?

180
00:10:50,928 --> 00:10:52,229
You're married. That's what.

181
00:10:52,648 --> 00:10:55,284
But isn't there anything else
besides not doing this and that?

182
00:10:55,652 --> 00:10:56,452
Like what?

183
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:58,825
Well like .. loving somebody.

184
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:05,015
Of course there is.
But don't think it's any bed of roses.

185
00:11:06,697 --> 00:11:09,106
And I know you've known
Ralph quite a time and ..

186
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:10,865
And being married, well ..

187
00:11:11,902 --> 00:11:14,287
Being married is different
from when I was a girl.

188
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,826
Us not knowing about ..

189
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:19,098
<i>Things</i> in advance.

190
00:11:20,143 --> 00:11:20,901
You know?

191
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,262
Things in advance?
- Yeah.

192
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:26,915
Oh, Ma .. that.

193
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:28,489
Well, it's important.

194
00:11:28,865 --> 00:11:30,880
Sure it is.
They call it 'compatibility'.

195
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,745
Well I don't care what they call it, but
just remember it's not the whole thing.

196
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,068
Like so many kids
nowadays seem to think.

197
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,128
Which is why there's all this trouble
all the time. Marrying and divorcing.

198
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,677
Ma, honestly. Ralph and me aren't
going to have any trouble that way.

199
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,135
Oh.

200
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:48,155
I mean we're both grown up.

201
00:11:48,619 --> 00:11:51,245
Sure, sugar. I know that and
it's nice you're so sensible.

202
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,052
Except, after a while it's just
not so important or anything.

203
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:56,730
Eddie, your sister is marrying Ralph.

204
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:57,998
That's good.

205
00:11:58,326 --> 00:11:59,599
Is that all you got to say?

206
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:00,787
Congratulations.

207
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:02,658
Eddie, your sister is marrying Ralph.

208
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:05,486
I heard you. That's what she said.
She's got him, so good.

209
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:07,665
I've never seen less family spirit.

210
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,714
Who's got spirit? I got nothing.

211
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,673
Next month, Fort Dix.
Then the Army has got nothing.

212
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,576
As long as you live here ..

213
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:18,359
Eddie, Ralph's family comes to dinner
tonight. You must be here to meet them.

214
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,281
I told the guys I'd see them early.

215
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:21,893
You be here.

216
00:12:22,343 --> 00:12:24,438
See, I've got no rights.
- Well, I've got to go.

217
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,109
Ma, will you talk to uncle Jack?
Explain to him?

218
00:12:28,318 --> 00:12:29,476
Yeah, I'll talk to him.

219
00:12:36,738 --> 00:12:37,607
Jane.

220
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,279
Yes, Ma?

221
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,296
Well ..

222
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,785
It's a big thing you're doing.

223
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:45,203
Well .. I'm late.

224
00:12:58,697 --> 00:13:00,659
So Jane is getting married at last.

225
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:03,419
I can't say it was a
surprise or anything.

226
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:06,464
The first one.

227
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,306
The first one to be married.

228
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:12,972
It will be nice for Jane
being settled with Ralph.

229
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:14,913
And raising her own family.

230
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:18,676
I wish we could give her a real wedding.

231
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:21,895
But she's got a good
head on her shoulders.

232
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:24,078
I was talking to her just now about ..

233
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,585
About being married.

234
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:29,177
She's got some funny
ideas. Most girls do.

235
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:30,748
But I talked sense to her.

236
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:33,038
I told her what it was like.

237
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:46,389
What it was like being married.

238
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,691
Well Jack, would you
like to hear some news?

239
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,448
What are you doing to yourself?

240
00:13:58,658 --> 00:14:00,179
I'm counting the beats of my heart.

241
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:02,056
Oh Jack, you're as healthy as anybody.

242
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,727
It's a fast unsteady beat.

243
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:07,066
And the blood pressure has gone
up again. I can feel it pounding.

244
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,389
My cousin Timothy passed
over from the very same thing.

245
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:14,078
Two years younger than me he
was and a man of iron, they say.

246
00:14:14,926 --> 00:14:16,371
Do you know, I .. I think I'll ..

247
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,571
Drop in and see the doctor.

248
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:21,855
Jane is getting married
at last to Ralph Halloran.

249
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:25,024
Ah, that's great news. Ha-ha.

250
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:26,594
That's great news.

251
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:29,193
Where is she now, in the kitchen?
- She just now went to work.

252
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:31,831
This is a day I thought
I'd never live to see.

253
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:34,643
Is it the fellow with the glasses?
- The same.

254
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,381
She's having the banns
announced at Sunday Mass.

255
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:43,839
With the wedding on the 6th.
Next Tuesday.

256
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,520
Ah, we'll give them a
party like none other.

257
00:14:46,773 --> 00:14:48,560
We'll put a barrel
of beer in the kitchen ..

258
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,818
And we'll pile the rooms high
with cousins, uncles and aunts.

259
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:53,990
Jack, tie your shoe
before you trip and fall.

260
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,068
See, Aggie.

261
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,422
Why not rent a hall the way
John did for Caroline?

262
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:58,452
Jack.

263
00:14:58,662 --> 00:15:01,576
I'll pay for the rent of the hall.
- Jack, it's not going to be that way.

264
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:04,822
She's just having a small
wedding early in the morning.

265
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,451
That's all.
- Why is that?

266
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:08,038
Because that's what she wants.

267
00:15:08,312 --> 00:15:09,316
And there are ..

268
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:11,313
Other complications.

269
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:12,403
So long, Mom.

270
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:14,963
Don't you be late, Eddie.
See, there's this ..

271
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:18,745
This fellow who has a car and
they're moving to California.

272
00:15:19,306 --> 00:15:21,770
But his wife is pregnant.
- What's that?

273
00:15:22,947 --> 00:15:25,260
Who is pregnant?
- The other fellow's wife.

274
00:15:25,606 --> 00:15:28,699
But the thing is this, Jack.
Now .. now don't be touchy.

275
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,195
You know how dear you are to all of us.

276
00:15:31,421 --> 00:15:34,384
But if we invite you, we got to
invite Michael and Tom and Joe.

277
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,503
And all the cousins. Before we know
it there'll be hundreds and hundreds.

278
00:15:37,824 --> 00:15:38,910
So, we decided ..

279
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,954
Just the simplest ceremony with
only with only immediate family.

280
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:45,951
And would I not be considered
one of the 'immediate family'?

281
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:49,323
Jack, you see it's very important
they're married on the 6th because ..

282
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:51,733
I see. Then I'm not
invited to the wedding?

283
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:53,870
Jack, you see that if we invite you ..

284
00:15:54,223 --> 00:15:57,244
We got to invite Tom and Michael
and Joe and all of Frank's bunch.

285
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,283
My coat. I left it around
here somewhere.

286
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:02,875
Jack, for heaven's sake. We want to have
you but you can see what would happen.

287
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:04,442
And tie your shoe.

288
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:08,870
The boy's parents are coming to dinner
and we wouldn't think not to have you.

289
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,303
Seven o'clock it is.
So don't be coming home late.

290
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:18,176
Oh Jack, you know you don't have to be
down to the Union Hall until 11 o'clock.

291
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:21,194
I think I'll call in and see
the doctor. I don't feel ..

292
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,826
Any too hearty.

293
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:26,004
Be home early. They come at seven.
Now don't forget.

294
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:29,367
And Jack, tie your shoe
before you trip and fall.

295
00:16:30,094 --> 00:16:31,437
The eggs you loaned me ..

296
00:16:31,677 --> 00:16:34,421
They were a lifesaver, Mrs Hurley.

297
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,163
Thanks for bringing them back.

298
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:38,990
Hey, have you got a little
cup of coffee for me?

299
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:39,993
Yeah.

300
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:41,383
Yeah.

301
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,474
You know, this varicose vein of mine.

302
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,449
It's murder.

303
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,262
I'm telling you .. plain murder.

304
00:16:51,563 --> 00:16:53,962
I don't know, maybe I'm
getting too old. I know that.

305
00:16:54,342 --> 00:16:55,963
I can't walk. I can't stand up.

306
00:16:57,293 --> 00:16:59,586
And .. how is your daughter, Jane?

307
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,600
She always goes out with
that fellow with the glasses.

308
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:05,274
She's getting married
on November the 6th.

309
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,123
Married?

310
00:17:07,454 --> 00:17:10,119
Ah, congratulations, Mrs Hurley.

311
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,923
Hey, that must be a load off your back.

312
00:17:14,523 --> 00:17:15,357
I know.

313
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:17,374
I married six girls.

314
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:20,595
And it was a stone
off my back every time.

315
00:17:21,893 --> 00:17:23,169
Ralph is a nice boy.

316
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:25,951
Look. Froze solid.

317
00:17:26,624 --> 00:17:28,016
He's well fixed, huh?

318
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:29,586
He's a teacher.

319
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:31,528
Well, that's alright.

320
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,682
His father is in real-estate.

321
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:35,185
Doing very good.

322
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:37,400
They live in one of
those big apartments.

323
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:39,355
Buildings with three elevators.

324
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:42,499
You know the kind? If you want to see
a person, you phone from downstairs.

325
00:17:42,841 --> 00:17:43,758
Yeah, I know.

326
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:46,927
Because my girl says she has one
of them things in their apartment.

327
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:48,539
And you know which one?

328
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:52,123
You know, she's the one
that has so much trouble.

329
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:53,917
But she married good.

330
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:56,103
Until now. I don't know why.

331
00:17:57,057 --> 00:17:57,701
Well.

332
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,799
The wedding is going
to be next week, huh?

333
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:01,872
So soon, ain't it?

334
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,076
Yeah .. just a small,
quiet affair. No fuss.

335
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,322
No reception.

336
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:09,155
Won't take ten minutes.

337
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:13,027
Ralph has got the loan of this car
and they're going off to California.

338
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,666
So it's going to be a quiet
affair, nobody around, huh?

339
00:18:15,876 --> 00:18:17,177
Yeah, that's what she wants.

340
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,717
You see, this fellow's wife is ..

341
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:23,977
Pregnant. So Ralph has
got the use of his car.

342
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,281
Pregnant?

343
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:43,196
And how are you, Mrs Hurley today?
- Pretty good.

344
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,192
Got company for dinner.
- The usual?

345
00:18:46,402 --> 00:18:48,313
No, I thought I'd have
something special.

346
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:50,873
How do you like that?

347
00:18:51,528 --> 00:18:52,436
A beauty.

348
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:55,325
So you're having your
in-laws over for supper?

349
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:56,644
Yeah, that's right.

350
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:59,521
How did you know? Hello, Mrs Casey.

351
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:02,232
You met my daughter-in-law?
- I used to be in school with Jane.

352
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,401
It's wonderful her getting
married and everything.

353
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:05,582
Yeah, it is.

354
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:07,444
Too bad she has to rush things so.

355
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:11,743
Well, it's just what Jane wants.
She don't want no fancy wedding.

356
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:14,387
You don't believe that,
if that's what she said?

357
00:19:14,826 --> 00:19:15,927
That's what she said.

358
00:19:16,475 --> 00:19:17,090
Joe.

359
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,750
Did you ever know a girl who
didn't want a fancy wedding?

360
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,279
And wear a white dress that
trails ten feet behind her.

361
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,010
It's a big thing in a girl's life.

362
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:27,394
Jane's not that type.
She's just a down-to-earth girl.

363
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:29,056
No nonsense.

364
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:31,664
Ten minutes in the morning
with Father Murphy.

365
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:33,562
And that's the story.

366
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:35,326
Ten minutes in the morning?

367
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:37,423
That don't even sound religious to me.

368
00:19:37,856 --> 00:19:39,811
Well I guess Father
Murphy knows what's ..

369
00:19:40,316 --> 00:19:41,937
Religious and what ain't.

370
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:43,652
Is she in trouble?

371
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:45,091
Is who in trouble?

372
00:19:45,845 --> 00:19:46,762
Your daughter.

373
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:48,734
What do you mean 'is she in trouble'?

374
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:52,035
I mean if she's getting married in
such a rush, what's the hurry for?

375
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:54,017
For heaven's sake, Mrs Casey.

376
00:19:54,656 --> 00:19:56,293
Look, they got the loan of this car.

377
00:19:57,216 --> 00:20:00,792
I think it's swell Jane don't put you to
a whole lot of expense you can't afford.

378
00:20:01,002 --> 00:20:03,846
When lots of girls in her place ..
- Look, we're not exactly on relief.

379
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:07,175
And we can afford to give our girl a
big wedding if that's what she wants.

380
00:20:07,843 --> 00:20:10,227
But you see. They got
the loan of this car.

381
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:12,363
Is she in trouble?
- Look.

382
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,110
The <i>other</i> fellow's
wife is having the baby.

383
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:22,496
I understand.

384
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:26,452
Hello. Is Ralph Halloran there?

385
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:31,949
Thanks, Jack.

386
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:36,102
Hello?

387
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,399
Ralph?

388
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:38,540
Hi.

389
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:40,788
About tonight, can your family make it?

390
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:42,974
What?

391
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,692
Well no, Ralph.

392
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:47,712
I was just thinking about you.

393
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,201
I know it's going to be kinda
rough for a couple of hours.

394
00:20:50,907 --> 00:20:53,800
It's something everybody
getting married has to do.

395
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:55,452
Getting their families together.

396
00:20:58,545 --> 00:20:59,247
Honey.

397
00:21:00,408 --> 00:21:03,485
Honey, it's not important if your
people or my people like each other.

398
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:05,334
<i>They'll size each other up</i>.

399
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:08,359
<i>And my family will figure you're lucky
and your family will figure I'm lucky</i>.

400
00:21:10,048 --> 00:21:12,298
So don't worry. I'll pick them
up and be over about seven.

401
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,550
<i>Goodbye, honey</i>.

402
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,362
Hi.

403
00:21:27,849 --> 00:21:29,556
Well Ralph. Hello.

404
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:32,492
How's the boy? Sit down and
take the load off your feet.

405
00:21:33,654 --> 00:21:35,826
How are you, kid? Long-time no see.

406
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,326
Sit down. Sit down.

407
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:40,857
We were looking at this man who brings
teenagers up on stage to do things.

408
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,565
The way Major Bowles used to.
My, they're talented.

409
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:46,060
I hear we go to a big blow-out tonight?
- Yeah.

410
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:48,970
Going to meet the new in-laws?
- It's just supper. That's all.

411
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:53,302
I can't wait to meet Jane's family.
But I'll never understand why they ..

412
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:56,196
Have you got a cold?
Look. No sweater on you.

413
00:21:56,406 --> 00:21:58,583
Say, how about a snort, Ralphie?
I got a bottle of rye.

414
00:21:58,793 --> 00:22:00,989
A brand-new bottle. Just waiting
for an excuse to open it.

415
00:22:01,199 --> 00:22:02,623
No, no thanks, Dad.
- Ralph.

416
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:06,165
I wish you weren't going off like this
without a proper party or anything.

417
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,509
It seems so kind of cold-blooded.
- Yeah, your Mom is right, Ralphie.

418
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:12,347
You know, it does seem like a
shame not having a real party.

419
00:22:13,205 --> 00:22:15,244
Of course, if Hurley hasn't
the money to spend ..

420
00:22:15,454 --> 00:22:16,299
Dad, Dad.

421
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:18,226
Mom. We don't want a party.

422
00:22:18,662 --> 00:22:21,861
If it was my daughter I'd spend my
last penny to give her a real wedding.

423
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,364
Say, what about me putting
up the money? Huh?

424
00:22:24,628 --> 00:22:26,709
Listen, I can get the ballroom
at the St Moritz hotel.

425
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:29,933
We couldn't do that, Joe. No.
Only the bride's father can do that.

426
00:22:30,143 --> 00:22:32,018
I'm sure the Hurleys won't object.

427
00:22:32,228 --> 00:22:33,378
Dad, please.

428
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:35,409
Please wait a minute.

429
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:37,701
All we want to do is get married.

430
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:40,770
You know, quietly. And then
take a trip and that's all.

431
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,695
Yeah, but I bet deep down in her
heart Jane would like a real wedding.

432
00:22:43,905 --> 00:22:47,289
Well never mind. What Ralphie
wants is final. Let's let it go at that.

433
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:50,589
I must change my clothes.
Have to look my best.

434
00:22:52,189 --> 00:22:53,837
About 4 o'clock in the morning.

435
00:22:55,024 --> 00:22:57,749
I heard these owls again,
so I turned to Mary and I said ..

436
00:22:57,997 --> 00:23:00,547
Honey, I said, do you hear those owls?
- She said 'no'.

437
00:23:00,828 --> 00:23:03,678
I said this is the last honeymoon I'm
ever going to spend in this wilderness.

438
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:07,011
She said this is the last honeymoon
you're going to spend. Period.

439
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,914
The joke of it is we never
did get to Niagara Falls.

440
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:19,655
Now it reminds me of a
story when a fellah went ..

441
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,226
Can I fix you one more drink?

442
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:23,086
Yes, you may sweeten it up a bit.

443
00:23:23,442 --> 00:23:24,565
On the rocks, please.

444
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,862
That reminds me of a story ..
- Can I fix you one?

445
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:29,755
Goodness, no. I am still
light-headed from the last one.

446
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,541
It was so strong.

447
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:33,539
It reminds me of when
our Irene was married.

448
00:23:33,754 --> 00:23:36,149
Ma, did you tell uncle Jack 7 o'clock?
- Yes, I did.

449
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:40,740
Oh thank you. Thank you kindly, ma'am.

450
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:45,387
Hurley, Ralphie here tells me that
you're in the taxicab business.

451
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:49,073
It's by way of being my livelihood. Yes.

452
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:51,150
It's interesting work, I'd say.

453
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:53,803
It has that side of it.

454
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,877
I expect you get to
see quite a bit of the ..

455
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,411
Passing parade, as it were ..

456
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,864
Now and then, I sorta get a look at it.

457
00:24:02,219 --> 00:24:04,008
I've a little mirror over
the windshield.

458
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:06,092
That's good, that is.

459
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:08,418
The little mirror over the windshield.

460
00:24:09,394 --> 00:24:11,179
I guess uncle Jack isn't coming home.

461
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:12,970
I'd better go and start.

462
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,407
I'll help.
- No.

463
00:24:14,617 --> 00:24:16,159
No, you stay with our guests. Eddie.

464
00:24:16,682 --> 00:24:17,803
Pull the table out.

465
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:19,745
Excuse me.

466
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,038
You own your own cab, do you?

467
00:24:23,813 --> 00:24:25,711
I have plans on buying one. Yes.

468
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:29,109
But first you must get this medallion.

469
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:30,908
A medallion?
- That's right.

470
00:24:31,118 --> 00:24:32,364
It's a city license.

471
00:24:32,582 --> 00:24:35,518
You see the city won't license more
hacks so you have to wait until ..

472
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,784
The fellah who's got a
medallion wants to sell.

473
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:41,053
And the going price right
now is about $8,000.

474
00:24:41,471 --> 00:24:42,773
Get some ice out right away.

475
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,513
What for?
- For the ice water.

476
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,430
You don't need anything for that.

477
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:49,399
We'll serve this dinner
proper if nothing else.

478
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:51,125
What do you mean 'nothing else'?

479
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:53,665
This was to be dinner like we
always have on Friday night.

480
00:24:53,942 --> 00:24:56,274
Somebody must do something when
our only daughter gets married.

481
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,087
Ma, we already decided.

482
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:01,365
So, instead it's being done like
it was shameful and secret.

483
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,727
What do you mean, 'shameful and secret'?

484
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:05,922
I hope we gave them the right whiskey.

485
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:08,333
Ralph says his father drinks too much.

486
00:25:08,788 --> 00:25:10,885
It's no concern of ours this night.

487
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:13,817
Ma, what's wrong?
Stop acting so nervous.

488
00:25:14,037 --> 00:25:16,231
Come on, take the tray
in and get them started.

489
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:17,364
Careful.

490
00:25:17,574 --> 00:25:19,360
I thought it was dinner
like we always have.

491
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,570
Go on. Be quick.

492
00:25:35,842 --> 00:25:37,688
It feels like I've eaten
myself half to death.

493
00:25:37,898 --> 00:25:40,382
That was a swell feed,
ma'am. A real swell feed.

494
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:42,056
You're welcome, I'm sure.

495
00:25:42,266 --> 00:25:45,425
I do hope it wasn't too much trouble.
I mean, so many at one time.

496
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:47,320
No, we always eat this way.

497
00:25:47,688 --> 00:25:49,882
I'm going to meet the fellows, huh Ma?
- Oh Eddie.

498
00:25:50,738 --> 00:25:53,496
I was wondering Mr Hurley whether you ..
- You know what I'll do for you kids?

499
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,398
I've got this apartment in mind for you.

500
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:58,133
It's a three-room apartment
in the Bedford Park section.

501
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,326
It's not big, but it's
got a nice kitchen.

502
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:02,128
Living room 18 x 11.

503
00:26:02,588 --> 00:26:04,033
And the rent, 81 dollars a month.

504
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,173
And the first year's rent.

505
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:08,193
That's my wedding present to you.

506
00:26:08,403 --> 00:26:10,219
Sweet of you, Mr Halloran.
But Ralph and I ..

507
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:11,637
It sure is, Dad but ..

508
00:26:11,847 --> 00:26:14,840
I figured it was the least we can do for
the young ones as they leave the nest.

509
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,459
Yes. They leave the nest.

510
00:26:16,765 --> 00:26:19,228
The oldest boy Joe has been
married ten years now.

511
00:26:19,695 --> 00:26:20,825
Has two fine children.

512
00:26:21,196 --> 00:26:23,208
Doing very well in these .. plastics.

513
00:26:23,517 --> 00:26:24,955
The two girls. Irene ..

514
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,731
She's been married now to a skin
doctor down in Washington DC.

515
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,097
They got a very stylish house, you know.

516
00:26:31,687 --> 00:26:33,735
Yes, they're up in the
northwest section.

517
00:26:34,105 --> 00:26:35,318
It's a ranch-type place.

518
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:37,094
That's awful nice but ..

519
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:41,243
When Irene got married we took the grand
ballroom at the Bedford Plaza Hotel.

520
00:26:41,453 --> 00:26:44,611
I liked the Bedford Plaza. I thought
it would be nice to live in a hotel.

521
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,169
We had over 400 guests there.

522
00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:52,169
Yeah. The table of hors d'oeuvres
alone cost me almost 1,400 dollars.

523
00:26:52,873 --> 00:26:54,062
Fourteen hundred.

524
00:26:54,802 --> 00:26:57,365
Of course, when the other girl got
married that was a real blow-out.

525
00:26:58,085 --> 00:27:01,708
We took the Grand Ballroom downtown
at the St Moritz hotel that time.

526
00:27:04,254 --> 00:27:06,830
We thought we'd give the kids
a check for a wedding present.

527
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:09,606
You know, to do what they want with.

528
00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:12,803
To the amount of .. a thousand dollars.

529
00:27:14,554 --> 00:27:16,178
You were saying something, Tom?

530
00:27:18,606 --> 00:27:21,301
Of course I know the kids say
they don't want a catered affair.

531
00:27:21,788 --> 00:27:23,679
But when my daughter
Irene got married ..

532
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,375
I was .. unavoidably detained.

533
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:28,471
Dinner is over.

534
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:32,094
A few old friends and I met by
chance in the Green Grass Grill.

535
00:27:32,392 --> 00:27:34,268
And I was .. detained.

536
00:27:34,577 --> 00:27:38,875
This is my brother Jack Conlon, Mr and
Mrs Halloran, and Ralph you know.

537
00:27:39,272 --> 00:27:40,345
Blessed to know you.

538
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,132
Pleased to meet you, Mrs Hannigan.

539
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,721
And to welcome you to this house.

540
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:46,211
Jack, Mr 'Halloran'.

541
00:27:46,547 --> 00:27:48,634
He was just telling us about
his daughter's wedding.

542
00:27:50,622 --> 00:27:52,297
Only immediate family.

543
00:27:52,524 --> 00:27:53,511
Huh? What's that?

544
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:58,507
Only the immediate family would be
welcome to the wedding of my niece.

545
00:27:58,996 --> 00:28:00,144
Uncle Jack.
- Well.

546
00:28:00,466 --> 00:28:02,010
What do you think of that, Hannigan?

547
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:03,560
'Halloran'.

548
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:05,558
Halloran, is it?
- Yeah.

549
00:28:06,045 --> 00:28:08,618
No relation by any chance
to my friend, Michael?

550
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:12,392
Died of drink last month,
at the Bellevue hospital?

551
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:14,796
No, no, no.

552
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:19,071
It's a common name, but he was an
uncommon man. Michael Halloran.

553
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:21,759
You were telling us about
your daughter's wedding.

554
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:26,552
The whole affair let me say was fully
discussed in the Green Grass Grill.

555
00:28:27,281 --> 00:28:30,451
That I wasn't to attend
the wedding of my niece.

556
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,436
Well, it was a fine dinner, Mrs Hurley.

557
00:28:35,661 --> 00:28:37,704
I don't know when I've
seen Joe eat so much.

558
00:28:37,974 --> 00:28:39,558
Twelve years I've lived in this room.

559
00:28:40,216 --> 00:28:42,564
Twelve long years in this very room.

560
00:28:43,215 --> 00:28:44,224
This very room?

561
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:48,010
That's my bed you're sitting on.
- Ha? Oh.

562
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:50,188
I didn't know. I didn't know.

563
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:52,861
Ralph, I think we'd better be going.

564
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,713
Don't disturb yourself, Mrs Halloran.

565
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:58,741
Mr Conlon wants to go to sleep.

566
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:01,281
As a matter of fact I
can do with a little rest.

567
00:29:01,691 --> 00:29:04,728
My heart is overtaxed today
and I .. need my beauty sleep.

568
00:29:05,556 --> 00:29:07,361
Jack is just carrying-on. That's all.

569
00:29:07,726 --> 00:29:08,892
Carrying on, is it?

570
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:11,998
I should think my last night
in this house might be ..

571
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:13,166
Your last night?

572
00:29:13,478 --> 00:29:15,081
Yes, Aggie. I move out tomorrow.

573
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:17,539
To find some residence elsewhere.

574
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:21,643
Now, one and all, goodnight.

575
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:29,713
Goodnight, Ralph.
- Goodnight, Mrs Hurley.

576
00:29:52,472 --> 00:29:53,789
Jane, I've been thinking.

577
00:29:56,414 --> 00:29:58,374
Well you heard him tonight.
You saw what happened.

578
00:29:58,698 --> 00:30:01,678
Giving away apartments right and left
they were. Buffalo this, Niagara that.

579
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:03,740
Don't worry.
We won't take an apartment.

580
00:30:03,955 --> 00:30:06,016
And your uncle Jack coming
home like a crazy man.

581
00:30:07,168 --> 00:30:07,812
Jane.

582
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:09,749
You got to have a real wedding.

583
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:12,103
Ma, we can't. That's all.
There isn't time.

584
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,368
Just think. You doll up
in a beautiful dress ..

585
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:16,402
With Alice as your Matron of Honor.

586
00:30:17,751 --> 00:30:19,534
Who gets married on five days' notice?

587
00:30:20,143 --> 00:30:21,182
Ralph and me.

588
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:25,631
Down at the market Mrs Casey all but
accused me of trying to hush things up.

589
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:26,940
I'll be right out.

590
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:29,838
And Mrs Musso, that old cat.

591
00:30:30,048 --> 00:30:31,488
She says you must be in trouble.

592
00:30:31,804 --> 00:30:32,738
Oh, ma.

593
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,736
Tom .. we've got to have a real wedding.

594
00:30:35,053 --> 00:30:38,080
Come on now, Aggie. Take it easy.
Let's not get in an uproar about this.

595
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,134
We owe it to the family. People will
say we're on relief of something.

596
00:30:41,454 --> 00:30:42,958
We're not and we know we're not.

597
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:46,173
And the wedding presents. I've given
away so many wedding presents.

598
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,808
That it they were piled high they'd
be as big as the Empire State.

599
00:30:49,177 --> 00:30:50,650
I'd like to get some of them back.

600
00:30:51,034 --> 00:30:51,992
Am I right, Tom?

601
00:30:52,564 --> 00:30:53,829
Yeah, you're right, Aggie.

602
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:56,234
Ma.

603
00:30:56,607 --> 00:30:59,320
We're not going to have any big
weddings. That's all there is to it.

604
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,582
Hey, I'm through.
- Put your shoes on.

605
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,890
You remember what happened
at Caroline's wedding?

606
00:31:04,243 --> 00:31:07,787
Aunt Emma won't talk to them as they
wouldn't sit her at the bride's table.

607
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:10,307
And Kathleen Riordan
was the Maid of Honor ..

608
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:12,248
Went and bought an organdie dress.

609
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,215
For forty-two dollars.

610
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:18,026
And Caroline wouldn't let her wear it
because only the bride can wear white.

611
00:31:18,456 --> 00:31:19,758
And they had that big fight.

612
00:31:21,803 --> 00:31:22,876
Thank you very much.

613
00:31:23,422 --> 00:31:26,784
But I don't want the fuss and fights
and screaming that always goes on.

614
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:32,991
Am I right, Pa?
- Yeah, you're right.

615
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:35,966
How can she be right and she be right?
How can they both be right?

616
00:31:36,176 --> 00:31:37,305
And you're right, too.

617
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:41,876
All I know is, I've deeply
offended my brother, Jack.

618
00:31:42,394 --> 00:31:44,585
Boy, he sure hung one on tonight.
- Shut up.

619
00:31:46,735 --> 00:31:48,158
I'm accused of atheism.

620
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,922
Of not loving my children and
of being a ward of the state.

621
00:31:51,173 --> 00:31:53,678
Ma, it's my wedding.
Let me run it my own way.

622
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:58,897
And that Halloran.

623
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:00,657
Giving them an apartment.

624
00:32:01,189 --> 00:32:04,107
What are we giving them for a wedding
present? Just a check for some money.

625
00:32:05,748 --> 00:32:07,278
What have we ever given the girl?

626
00:32:07,847 --> 00:32:10,328
Her coming unexpected
and us favoring Terence.

627
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:11,979
God rest his soul.

628
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,299
And I feel very guilty.

629
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:17,797
I feel we owe her a big
splash for a wedding.

630
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:21,589
Maybe it costs us two thousand dollars.
- Two thousand?

631
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:24,141
Oh.

632
00:32:24,729 --> 00:32:26,102
So you're awake now, are you?

633
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:29,414
You're not sleepy when there are no
guests to be run out of the house.

634
00:32:30,002 --> 00:32:33,391
Ma, Ralph only has three weeks off.
It's important he sees New Mexico.

635
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:35,675
If we want to take advantage
of that car, we ..

636
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:36,858
That car.

637
00:32:37,368 --> 00:32:39,857
I've been explaining about
the fellow with the car.

638
00:32:40,187 --> 00:32:42,583
And the wife who's
pregnant in California.

639
00:32:42,834 --> 00:32:45,334
And every time I tell it,
it sounds sillier.

640
00:32:48,046 --> 00:32:49,462
How are you feeling, uncle Jack?

641
00:32:49,774 --> 00:32:50,820
Don't talk to me.

642
00:32:51,351 --> 00:32:52,802
Oh for heaven's sakes.

643
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,742
I've lived in this house
for twelve years.

644
00:32:55,226 --> 00:32:57,958
If that isn't 'immediate family'
I don't know what is.

645
00:32:59,013 --> 00:33:00,023
Oh, Jack ..

646
00:33:01,685 --> 00:33:02,826
Well there you are.

647
00:33:03,036 --> 00:33:05,299
Your uncle Jack who lent us
the money when we was broke.

648
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:07,647
Who pays his share of the rent here.

649
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,487
Moving out because he's hurt.

650
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:11,340
Well, I tell you something.

651
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:13,874
You're going to have big wedding
whether you like it or not.

652
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,386
And if you don't like it
you don't have to come.

653
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:21,592
I'm right, Tom.
I know I'm right about this.

654
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:25,178
It's all for her. Something
for her. Before it's too late.

655
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,844
Well?

656
00:33:31,268 --> 00:33:33,484
I'm going to bed.
- Well, am I right?

657
00:33:35,106 --> 00:33:35,778
Aggie.

658
00:33:36,804 --> 00:33:39,359
Two thousand dollars is half
of everything I ever saved.

659
00:33:40,723 --> 00:33:41,680
Look, Tom.

660
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:44,768
Think of that girl leaving this house.

661
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:47,329
With nothing to show for
her whole life with us.

662
00:33:48,437 --> 00:33:50,063
Just moving out like ..

663
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:52,676
Like she was changing her place to live.

664
00:33:53,685 --> 00:33:55,652
We've been like nothing at all to her.

665
00:33:57,008 --> 00:33:58,038
Just strangers.

666
00:33:59,017 --> 00:34:00,727
Living in the same house.

667
00:34:17,082 --> 00:34:18,406
[ Door knocks ]

668
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:36,169
Jane, I'm sorry about just now.

669
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:38,836
About losing my temper, I mean.

670
00:34:40,858 --> 00:34:42,009
But I meant it.

671
00:34:42,345 --> 00:34:43,609
Every word I said.

672
00:34:44,972 --> 00:34:47,018
About being so worried about
what the neighbors said?

673
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:49,289
Afraid they thought I was in trouble?

674
00:34:49,499 --> 00:34:52,061
No, no. That don't matter.
I mean what I said.

675
00:34:57,001 --> 00:34:58,583
We never done anything for you.

676
00:35:00,776 --> 00:35:01,539
But Ma ..

677
00:35:01,944 --> 00:35:03,807
We aren't asking for anything.

678
00:35:04,538 --> 00:35:07,205
I know it's not much of anything
after all these years.

679
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:10,316
Just to give you a fine
party but your Pa and me ..

680
00:35:12,326 --> 00:35:15,110
Well, your Ma wants this
wedding very much.

681
00:35:18,726 --> 00:35:20,576
Ma .. I don't know.

682
00:35:23,043 --> 00:35:24,042
I don't know.

683
00:35:26,453 --> 00:35:28,224
Jane, I never had a proper wedding.

684
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,265
I was married all in a rush
one Saturday morning.

685
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:35,350
And me in this old cotton dress not
fit to be seen on the streets with ..

686
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,683
Let alone be married in.

687
00:35:39,099 --> 00:35:40,697
I know I said I didn't mind.

688
00:35:41,843 --> 00:35:42,815
But I did.

689
00:35:43,495 --> 00:35:44,402
To this day.

690
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,544
Look.

691
00:35:48,808 --> 00:35:51,423
I want you to have this one fine thing.

692
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,634
With all the trimmings.

693
00:35:54,835 --> 00:35:56,435
Something to remember when ..

694
00:35:57,603 --> 00:35:59,417
When the bad days come and ..

695
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:02,179
You're all wore out.

696
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:05,310
And growing old.

697
00:36:06,806 --> 00:36:07,535
Like me.

698
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:10,824
Ma.

699
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:19,413
Alright, Ma.

700
00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:23,536
I'll tell Ralph.

701
00:36:24,055 --> 00:36:25,321
He isn't going to like it.

702
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,450
Sure he will.

703
00:36:29,441 --> 00:36:31,401
At least it keeps uncle
Jack from moving out.

704
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:32,622
Yeah. Poor man.

705
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:36,335
I felt so high when I had to tell
him he wasn't to see you married.

706
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:39,298
It will take a lot of figuring out.
- Yeah.

707
00:36:39,508 --> 00:36:41,123
Sending out invitations and ..

708
00:36:43,876 --> 00:36:46,627
We won't be able to have the trip.
- So you go someplace nearby.

709
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,234
I got to go to bed.
I got a lot to do tomorrow.

710
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:50,972
See you in the morning, Jane.

711
00:37:01,891 --> 00:37:03,724
Goodnight, Jane.
- Goodnight, Ma.

712
00:37:28,399 --> 00:37:29,458
[ Telephone ]

713
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:35,260
Hello?
- <i>Hello, Ralph?</i>

714
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:37,201
<i>I'm sorry about waking you up</i>.

715
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:38,653
Janie, what's the matter?

716
00:37:38,863 --> 00:37:40,107
No, nothing is the matter.

717
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:41,698
I'm fine.

718
00:37:42,629 --> 00:37:43,653
Sure I'm sure.

719
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,944
Ralph.

720
00:37:47,937 --> 00:37:48,703
Ralph.

721
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:52,564
I just want to tell you something.

722
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:56,237
But it will keep until tomorrow.

723
00:37:56,447 --> 00:37:58,295
I'm wide awake now, honey.

724
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:00,328
You might as well tell me now.

725
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:03,415
It's nothing, Ralph. I got to be
downtown tomorrow anyway.

726
00:38:03,643 --> 00:38:06,082
And I thought we'd meet and
have coffee and talk a little.

727
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:09,250
I'm sorry about waking you up.

728
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,650
Goodnight, Ralph.

729
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:22,882
Hi.

730
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:25,098
Hi .. you're late.

731
00:38:26,115 --> 00:38:27,797
You should have started without me.

732
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:31,656
Listen. What was all the mystery about?

733
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,433
Mystery?

734
00:38:37,686 --> 00:38:38,519
Well, yeah.

735
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:40,983
Calling me in the middle of the night.

736
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,154
Start to tell me something. Stop. Start.

737
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:46,018
Stop. Tell me not to worry, so I
spend half the night worrying.

738
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:51,367
Ralph.
- Yeah?

739
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,097
Nothing.

740
00:38:54,272 --> 00:38:56,056
Janie, what's the matter with you?

741
00:38:56,564 --> 00:38:58,295
I can't talk to you when
you're in a mood.

742
00:38:58,964 --> 00:38:59,975
<i>I'm</i> in a mood?

743
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,075
Stop building it up in your mind.

744
00:39:04,615 --> 00:39:05,344
Alright.

745
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:15,463
Ralph.
- Uhuh.

746
00:39:16,553 --> 00:39:17,225
Ralph.

747
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:19,842
Do you love me?
- No.

748
00:39:20,504 --> 00:39:22,235
I'm marrying you
because I don't love you.

749
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:24,559
I mean nothing could
spoil it for us, could it?

750
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,197
Like what?

751
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:29,425
Like having a wedding
party .. or a catered affair.

752
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:31,298
A wedding party?
- Now don't get ..

753
00:39:31,508 --> 00:39:33,908
I thought we decided about the ..
- I know, I know.

754
00:39:34,714 --> 00:39:35,698
I know but ..

755
00:39:35,908 --> 00:39:37,782
Ma asked me tonight if we can have ..
- Ma ..

756
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,903
Well you heard them. You know
the way your folks carried on about ..

757
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:44,352
The big weddings they
gave your sisters and ..

758
00:39:44,734 --> 00:39:47,129
All the talk about giving
away apartments.

759
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:49,441
Okay, so what's wrong with
them giving us an apartment?

760
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:51,587
There's nothing wrong.

761
00:39:52,191 --> 00:39:55,823
But Ma near blew her top listening to
the things your folk did for their kids.

762
00:39:58,319 --> 00:39:59,633
While she and Pa ..

763
00:40:00,163 --> 00:40:03,020
Haven't done a thing
about us getting married.

764
00:40:04,676 --> 00:40:05,539
Because.

765
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,775
They are ..

766
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,749
They haven't got any money.

767
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,700
Ralph, if you don't want
this thing, we won't have it.

768
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,091
We're the ones getting married.
- Right.

769
00:40:17,724 --> 00:40:19,820
It will kill Ma if we don't
have this wedding party.

770
00:40:20,183 --> 00:40:22,779
I guess it means something special
to her and I thought we can ..

771
00:40:25,104 --> 00:40:26,448
I told her I'd ask you.

772
00:40:27,015 --> 00:40:28,317
And meet her downtown and ..

773
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,211
We'd look at some bridal gowns.

774
00:40:31,772 --> 00:40:32,718
Ask me ..

775
00:40:33,105 --> 00:40:35,203
You're not asking me, honey.
You're telling me.

776
00:40:40,414 --> 00:40:41,368
Ralph.

777
00:40:42,502 --> 00:40:43,636
Are you mad at me?

778
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:47,173
Your mother wants a big,
fancy, extravagant wedding.

779
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:50,363
Your cousins want it, your
uncles want it, now you want it.

780
00:40:50,752 --> 00:40:54,159
In fact the whole Irish population
of the Bronx wants a catered affair.

781
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,336
Leave the poor Irish out of it ..
- I'd like to leave everyone out of it.

782
00:41:01,638 --> 00:41:03,854
Can we talk a minute?
- I must go to the library. I'm late.

783
00:41:04,064 --> 00:41:05,079
Wait. Please wait.

784
00:41:09,978 --> 00:41:12,608
If you want a big affair,
we'll have a big affair.

785
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:15,285
It's just that I never knew
it was so important to you.

786
00:41:16,413 --> 00:41:17,817
Not to me. To her.

787
00:41:18,368 --> 00:41:19,304
To Mom.

788
00:41:19,698 --> 00:41:20,836
What it means to her.

789
00:41:23,123 --> 00:41:25,551
If it takes a catered affair
to bring love to the world.

790
00:41:25,988 --> 00:41:27,647
You got my approval. Okay?

791
00:41:29,191 --> 00:41:30,060
Alright.

792
00:41:31,237 --> 00:41:32,616
You're very understanding.

793
00:41:33,647 --> 00:41:35,457
Frankly, I don't understand it at all.

794
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,760
Looks like we've all been deserted.

795
00:41:45,638 --> 00:41:49,043
Jane out somewhere at the crack of dawn.
Aggie tending to the invitations.

796
00:41:50,002 --> 00:41:53,192
You wouldn't by any chance be going in
the direction of the Green Grass Grill?

797
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:54,964
Yeah, yeah. It happens. Come on.

798
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,505
I'm having tea with Mrs Rafferty.

799
00:41:58,137 --> 00:42:01,354
Ah yes, it was a great idea
to give the girl a fine wedding.

800
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:04,383
To launch her down the
ways, you might say ..

801
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,848
Like a fine ship, all flags flying.

802
00:42:12,586 --> 00:42:16,833
All things considered, it's wise to give
the youngsters a swell, bang-up wedding.

803
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:19,178
Yeah. 2,000 dollars.
That's 'bang-up' alright.

804
00:42:19,562 --> 00:42:21,665
You know I'm willing to
contribute any sum that ..

805
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:23,847
No, no, no .. no, Jack.

806
00:42:25,454 --> 00:42:26,698
No, this is Aggie's party.

807
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:29,205
Aggie had the right idea.

808
00:42:29,587 --> 00:42:31,979
Hire a big ballroom. Give a great party.

809
00:42:32,418 --> 00:42:33,669
Yeah, the women.

810
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:35,810
Ah, the ladies. God bless them.

811
00:42:36,432 --> 00:42:37,848
What would we do without ladies?

812
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:40,189
I ain't noticed you getting
married to one, Jack Conlon.

813
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:42,689
I reserve my company for the world.

814
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:43,832
Oh yeah.

815
00:42:55,504 --> 00:42:58,307
I'll see you in the ballroom of
the Concourse Plaza at 5 o'clock.

816
00:42:58,598 --> 00:42:59,891
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

817
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:06,723
Well, Mrs Rafferty.

818
00:43:07,046 --> 00:43:10,936
There's been a change in the situation
since we met at the Green Grass Grill.

819
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:11,961
Oh?

820
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:15,987
I have the kettle boiling
for your tea, Mr Conlon.

821
00:43:16,422 --> 00:43:19,104
Yes, Jane's wedding is going
to be a proper affair after all.

822
00:43:21,104 --> 00:43:22,831
And you will be going, after all?

823
00:43:23,071 --> 00:43:25,234
I'll be going and so
will you, Mrs Rafferty.

824
00:43:26,607 --> 00:43:28,064
I can't do that, Mr Conlon.

825
00:43:28,695 --> 00:43:29,936
I don't know your people.

826
00:43:30,366 --> 00:43:32,116
You get to know them at the reception.

827
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:34,467
What changed their minds now?

828
00:43:34,983 --> 00:43:36,189
The firm stand I took.

829
00:43:36,684 --> 00:43:39,802
I told them I was moving
out so they came round fast.

830
00:43:40,292 --> 00:43:41,164
Would you ..?

831
00:43:41,558 --> 00:43:43,775
Would you really have moved
out of your sister's apartment?

832
00:43:45,214 --> 00:43:46,875
Perhaps it was an idle threat.

833
00:43:47,806 --> 00:43:49,071
But where would I go?

834
00:43:49,529 --> 00:43:52,327
Well .. there's something to be
said for not living with in-laws.

835
00:43:52,738 --> 00:43:54,927
But you like living with your
married daughter, don't you?

836
00:43:55,346 --> 00:43:58,613
Especially now she's not underfoot
since she took a job working all day.

837
00:43:59,449 --> 00:44:00,093
True.

838
00:44:00,643 --> 00:44:02,088
I have the whole place to myself.

839
00:44:04,335 --> 00:44:07,249
After all, it's companionable
living with your own kin.

840
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,848
When you've no husband
or wife of your own.

841
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,087
I've been a widow a long time.

842
00:44:14,724 --> 00:44:17,795
Well, better to have
loved and lost, as they say.

843
00:44:18,152 --> 00:44:18,738
Oh?

844
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:22,442
Oh yes. Of course, I myself belong
to a long line of bachelors.

845
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,010
That's to say my uncles
were all bachelors.

846
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:29,868
Yes, it's a matter of pride in a man
avoiding the pitfalls of matrimony.

847
00:44:30,215 --> 00:44:33,437
I've got three bachelor brothers living
together back in County Limerick.

848
00:44:33,876 --> 00:44:34,987
Think of that.

849
00:44:35,373 --> 00:44:37,842
My sister Mary was born
here first. Then Aggie.

850
00:44:38,781 --> 00:44:40,998
Ah, you'd have loved Mary.

851
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,459
I'm sure I would.

852
00:44:42,669 --> 00:44:45,567
She kept house for me for twenty
years and never got married herself.

853
00:44:46,422 --> 00:44:48,158
Oh, a striking girl.

854
00:44:48,851 --> 00:44:50,392
Weighed near two hundred pounds.

855
00:44:50,679 --> 00:44:51,548
My, my, my.

856
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:56,126
A fine, big jolly girl with
a smile like the morning.

857
00:44:57,313 --> 00:44:57,928
Yes.

858
00:44:58,138 --> 00:45:01,064
She dropped dead one night
listening to a joke I was telling.

859
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,413
You know, the one about the lady
missionary and the cannibals?

860
00:45:04,763 --> 00:45:05,817
Oh, that one.

861
00:45:09,014 --> 00:45:10,107
Keeled over dead.

862
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:11,591
A fine way to go.

863
00:45:11,975 --> 00:45:15,228
Laughing at a funny story with a
bottle of beer in your hands. Ha-ha.

864
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,483
It was so.

865
00:45:17,096 --> 00:45:19,072
Well Mrs Rafferty, shall we
have a bit of a game?

866
00:45:19,774 --> 00:45:21,465
I was hoping you might suggest it.

867
00:45:21,683 --> 00:45:23,658
I feel luck in my bones today.

868
00:45:24,629 --> 00:45:27,017
Will it be one or two
Canastas to go out?

869
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,057
Let's play two. And pick up two cards.

870
00:45:31,267 --> 00:45:31,911
Good.

871
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:34,696
And how does the count stand, as of now?

872
00:45:36,638 --> 00:45:38,903
I am in debt to you to the amount of ..

873
00:45:39,608 --> 00:45:41,442
Twenty-four thousand
seven hundred dollars.

874
00:45:41,808 --> 00:45:45,179
Well, let's see if we can make
it an even twenty-five thousand.

875
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:54,592
Oh sorry, Miss.
- Hold your breath in.

876
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:56,793
I'm not going to be able
to breathe in this thing.

877
00:45:57,116 --> 00:45:58,757
You want no waist, I give you no waist.

878
00:45:59,207 --> 00:46:02,332
We can let it out after the wedding
if you need the gown for a formal.

879
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:03,585
A formal?

880
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,391
You wouldn't want all this expense
just for one time, would you?

881
00:46:07,783 --> 00:46:09,453
Is that all, Mr Meyer?
- That's all.

882
00:46:10,196 --> 00:46:12,365
Where's Alice? I thought you
said she'd meet you here.

883
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:13,922
She'll be along.

884
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:17,080
You know what she said when
I told her I was getting married?

885
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:19,347
She said .. 'so what else is new'.

886
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:22,484
It sounded funny the way she
said it over the telephone.

887
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:24,925
I know one thing.
I don't want to be around ..

888
00:46:25,135 --> 00:46:28,376
When Pa finds out this dress
alone is going to cost $120.

889
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,147
Hello, Alice.

890
00:46:30,782 --> 00:46:32,400
Alice .. look.

891
00:46:34,011 --> 00:46:35,599
Oh, Jane. It's beautiful.

892
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:39,940
Wouldn't it be wonderful if we
could dress up like this all the time?

893
00:46:40,582 --> 00:46:42,027
I wonder how it would look on me.

894
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:45,789
You got to admit it's kind of
stylish like I always dressed.

895
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:49,198
And now Alice here will find
out what she's going to wear.

896
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:52,440
I was thinking rose might
be alright with this.

897
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:53,967
Yeah, I ..

898
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:55,951
Here are the shoes we wanted.

899
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:59,017
This is Alice Scanlon.
She will be my Matron of Honor.

900
00:46:59,336 --> 00:47:02,670
Well I'm sure we can find something
special for our Matron of Honor.

901
00:47:03,226 --> 00:47:04,470
Come on, you'll love blue.

902
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:06,531
Come on, let's go to a floral dress.

903
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:08,062
No. Not right now.

904
00:47:08,294 --> 00:47:09,710
You go ahead while I change.

905
00:47:09,983 --> 00:47:13,074
Something old, something new,
something borrowed, something blue.

906
00:47:25,888 --> 00:47:27,935
It's been nice shopping together.

907
00:47:29,902 --> 00:47:31,617
We never did that before.

908
00:47:33,672 --> 00:47:37,906
I want you to know I'm sorry we never
went shopping together before, Jane.

909
00:47:39,865 --> 00:47:41,209
You know what I mean, Jane?

910
00:47:43,014 --> 00:47:47,056
I mean, I'm sorry I didn't take more
interest in you when you was little.

911
00:47:48,287 --> 00:47:49,373
I was always ..

912
00:47:50,212 --> 00:47:53,183
We had the curse of money over
us all our lives, your Pa and me.

913
00:47:53,715 --> 00:47:55,236
You're spending a lot today.

914
00:47:55,935 --> 00:47:58,254
It was your idea.
Remember it when he hits the ceiling.

915
00:47:59,158 --> 00:48:01,817
All he has to do is to think
of how <i>we</i> was married.

916
00:48:02,873 --> 00:48:04,289
The only reason he married me ..

917
00:48:04,499 --> 00:48:07,312
Was that my father, God rest his soul,
met him one day at the Union Hall.

918
00:48:07,812 --> 00:48:09,428
They was both house painters, you know.

919
00:48:09,968 --> 00:48:11,383
And he said: 'Hurley ..'

920
00:48:11,712 --> 00:48:14,402
'I'll give you $300 if you
will marry my daughter'.

921
00:48:15,906 --> 00:48:17,642
And he said he would and he did.

922
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,559
I never heard that story, Ma.

923
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,142
Oh sure, sure.

924
00:48:23,795 --> 00:48:25,764
Of course I'm
exaggerating a little, but ..

925
00:48:26,302 --> 00:48:27,822
But that's the gist of it.

926
00:48:28,776 --> 00:48:30,258
He is a good man, your father.

927
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:33,566
When Terence was killed in Korea.

928
00:48:34,634 --> 00:48:36,267
I think I'd have died myself.

929
00:48:37,003 --> 00:48:39,392
If it hadn't been for the
steadiness in your father.

930
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,430
But he's a very close
man with the money.

931
00:48:42,717 --> 00:48:44,746
I never knew that story
about you and Pa.

932
00:48:45,683 --> 00:48:46,727
I thought you knew.

933
00:48:53,507 --> 00:48:55,473
Jane, we was never very close.

934
00:48:56,495 --> 00:48:57,686
It's all my fault.

935
00:48:58,147 --> 00:48:59,405
No reproach to you.

936
00:49:00,883 --> 00:49:02,909
But when you start getting on like me.

937
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:05,991
You start looking back at things.

938
00:49:07,035 --> 00:49:08,202
Look, this is dumb.

939
00:49:08,797 --> 00:49:10,935
Don't listen to a word I said. Come on.

940
00:49:11,473 --> 00:49:12,970
I got a million things to do.

941
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:17,236
We found her this lovely blue organdie.

942
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,165
But she feels it doesn't suit her.

943
00:49:19,375 --> 00:49:22,208
I'll tell you about it at lunch, Jane.
- We did want something in rose.

944
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,792
Who do I make the deposit to?
- I'll be right back.

945
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,892
You go on, girls. I'll make the deposit.

946
00:49:27,186 --> 00:49:29,144
Mom. See you tonight.
I'll have dinner with Ralph.

947
00:49:29,354 --> 00:49:30,913
Well, don't stay out until all hours.

948
00:49:31,304 --> 00:49:33,916
Oh Jane, the deposit is
going to clean me out.

949
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,078
Can I have a dollar for bus fare?
- Sure.

950
00:49:36,288 --> 00:49:38,170
Will that be enough?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

951
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:40,468
Nice to have seen you, Alice.
- Nice to have seen you.

952
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:42,265
I'll get you the dollar back tomorrow.

953
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:48,055
I don't know what Pa will do when he
finds out how much money we spent.

954
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,662
At this point, I don't care.

955
00:49:49,872 --> 00:49:51,974
I mean. If we're to have a
big wedding, let's have one.

956
00:49:52,328 --> 00:49:53,372
Two coffees please.

957
00:49:54,095 --> 00:49:57,204
Before I forget. Let's
make a list of bridesmaids.

958
00:49:57,438 --> 00:49:59,217
I wrote down some names last night.

959
00:50:00,151 --> 00:50:01,995
First of all we've got
to have Mary Elisabeth.

960
00:50:02,205 --> 00:50:04,905
You know, because she
had us as her bridesmaids.

961
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,535
She's a wonderful girl.
- Jane.

962
00:50:06,899 --> 00:50:08,762
Jane, I don't want to
be a Matron of Honor.

963
00:50:10,404 --> 00:50:11,614
What do you mean?

964
00:50:15,118 --> 00:50:18,604
You've got to swear to God you'll never
tell anybody about this because I ..

965
00:50:22,743 --> 00:50:24,393
Alice, what's the matter?

966
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:28,146
Jane.

967
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:31,502
I can't tell you how
ashamed I feel about this.

968
00:50:33,094 --> 00:50:35,956
But we don't have money to spend
on blue organdie or anything.

969
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:38,597
For heaven's sake.

970
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:42,090
That dress alone costs
thirty-five dollars, Jane and ..

971
00:50:42,382 --> 00:50:44,831
You know .. Bill is out of work.

972
00:50:45,717 --> 00:50:47,649
He don't even sleep
nights now, with worry.

973
00:50:48,603 --> 00:50:49,968
We haven't got one cent.

974
00:50:50,365 --> 00:50:51,180
But look ..

975
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:54,936
Even if I could afford the dress,
Bill has to have a tuxedo.

976
00:50:55,837 --> 00:50:57,353
He doesn't have to wear a tuxedo.

977
00:50:58,266 --> 00:51:00,424
If I wear the gown,
he's got to wear a tuxedo.

978
00:51:00,634 --> 00:51:02,641
That costs 15 to 20 dollars to rent.

979
00:51:03,066 --> 00:51:05,179
He doesn't need to wear any tuxedo.

980
00:51:05,615 --> 00:51:06,916
Just a plain blue suit.

981
00:51:07,286 --> 00:51:08,651
He don't have a blue suit.

982
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:15,547
Don't you remember?

983
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:18,398
I told you how embarrassed I was
he don't even have a blue suit.

984
00:51:19,398 --> 00:51:22,522
Alice, the trouble with you is
you're too ashamed of these things.

985
00:51:24,436 --> 00:51:26,597
So, he has to go out
and get a blue suit.

986
00:51:27,511 --> 00:51:29,593
That will cost him 60 bucks. And that ..

987
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:32,515
Blue organdie is 35 bucks and I ..

988
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:36,596
I got have shoes to match the dress
and a bag to match the shoes.

989
00:51:40,105 --> 00:51:40,691
So.

990
00:51:42,464 --> 00:51:44,671
For me, to be your Matron of Honor.

991
00:51:45,323 --> 00:51:47,622
Is going to cost Bill and
me a hundred dollars.

992
00:51:50,792 --> 00:51:52,626
We can't afford that.

993
00:51:54,617 --> 00:51:55,747
And that's that.

994
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:58,341
Please.

995
00:51:59,111 --> 00:52:01,021
Don't ever tell anybody about this.

996
00:52:01,696 --> 00:52:02,672
You're broke.

997
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,115
What's so terrible?

998
00:52:04,473 --> 00:52:06,707
Jane, I'm very sensitive about this.
You know it.

999
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:09,424
Alice.

1000
00:52:09,802 --> 00:52:12,693
I can loan you the money for the dress.
- I don't want to talk about it.

1001
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:16,736
Don't be so touchy.

1002
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:19,470
Jane, you say one more word
and I get up and get out of here.

1003
00:52:19,726 --> 00:52:20,709
Alright.

1004
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:22,211
Alright.

1005
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,492
Alice.

1006
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,341
Leave me alone.

1007
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:10,377
I arrived a bit early. Sort of
examining the premises, you might say.

1008
00:53:10,923 --> 00:53:11,824
Where's Aggie?

1009
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:13,747
I thought she was coming with you.

1010
00:53:14,041 --> 00:53:14,627
No.

1011
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:16,363
Seen the manager yet?

1012
00:53:16,723 --> 00:53:19,014
He's inside his office waiting for us.
Look. Look at that.

1013
00:53:19,386 --> 00:53:20,557
Isn't that magnificent.

1014
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,922
I bet it cost a mint.

1015
00:53:22,527 --> 00:53:24,256
I was so far downtown.

1016
00:53:26,714 --> 00:53:27,953
Isn't it grand?

1017
00:53:29,024 --> 00:53:31,066
Let's get it over with.
I got to be going soon.

1018
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:33,239
Oh Jack, you should have
seen Janie and me today.

1019
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:34,772
It was something.

1020
00:53:34,982 --> 00:53:38,020
We picked out a lace wedding dress
which goes right down to the floor.

1021
00:53:38,254 --> 00:53:39,298
Sounds mighty fine.

1022
00:53:39,602 --> 00:53:41,522
It was something.
She looked just like ..

1023
00:53:41,731 --> 00:53:43,680
Look, if you don't mind.
I got just so much time.

1024
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:45,678
We see the manager now
and get the bad news.

1025
00:53:45,905 --> 00:53:47,510
I was just telling Jack something.

1026
00:53:47,752 --> 00:53:49,350
And this dress goes out to here ..

1027
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,172
It's that kind of thing.

1028
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:53,152
With orange blossoms on the top.

1029
00:53:54,502 --> 00:53:56,004
Mrs Hurley, I'm pleased to see you.

1030
00:53:56,512 --> 00:53:57,842
Mr Conlon, we've already met.

1031
00:53:58,296 --> 00:53:59,383
Mr Hurley.

1032
00:54:00,089 --> 00:54:01,991
We've come to talk about
our daughter's wedding.

1033
00:54:02,201 --> 00:54:04,071
Yes, I know.
I got together a few things.

1034
00:54:04,632 --> 00:54:07,095
Our rates and so on.
- How much will it cost?

1035
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:09,856
First, I must have an idea
what you have in mind.

1036
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:12,129
Also the next availability
of the ballroom.

1037
00:54:12,974 --> 00:54:14,353
How much will this come to?

1038
00:54:14,992 --> 00:54:17,517
That depends on how many people
you have for the wedding breakfast.

1039
00:54:18,216 --> 00:54:20,917
Now here are some pictures of
one of our buffets, by the way.

1040
00:54:22,763 --> 00:54:24,253
How many do you think, Tom?

1041
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:26,220
Close to two hundred, I'd say.

1042
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:28,018
Two hundred?
- Yes.

1043
00:54:28,479 --> 00:54:30,804
Where do you get two hundred?
We don't even know fifty people.

1044
00:54:31,169 --> 00:54:32,977
We've got to cut the list down as it is.

1045
00:54:34,479 --> 00:54:36,504
200 people? How do you get 200 people?

1046
00:54:36,714 --> 00:54:37,638
Excuse me.

1047
00:54:38,374 --> 00:54:39,342
Yes. Of course.

1048
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:51,230
Look, Tom. There's Harry and Barney
and Joe and all that crowd.

1049
00:54:51,868 --> 00:54:54,319
Then there's the Dennisons.
There must be eighteen of them.

1050
00:54:54,784 --> 00:54:56,300
Then what about your brother, Jack?

1051
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:58,156
Then there is Harry. Then Helen ..

1052
00:54:58,584 --> 00:55:00,558
Harry won't come all the
way from West Virginia.

1053
00:55:00,768 --> 00:55:02,296
Oh sure he will, and the cousins.

1054
00:55:02,652 --> 00:55:05,333
What about them? Jane must have
some friends of her own she wants.

1055
00:55:05,696 --> 00:55:07,856
It could be more like a hundred
and fifty than a hundred.

1056
00:55:08,325 --> 00:55:10,168
I thought they were just
coming to the church.

1057
00:55:10,378 --> 00:55:12,446
I didn't know I was to pay
for their breakfast too.

1058
00:55:14,651 --> 00:55:18,068
Let's say in round numbers, a hundred
for us, and a hundred for the groom.

1059
00:55:18,278 --> 00:55:19,471
How much would that be?

1060
00:55:19,854 --> 00:55:21,585
Now, the breakfast is
five dollars apiece.

1061
00:55:22,116 --> 00:55:23,646
Now there are the flowers of course.

1062
00:55:23,856 --> 00:55:25,870
Here are some models
of our table decorations.

1063
00:55:26,171 --> 00:55:27,158
This is a single.

1064
00:55:27,414 --> 00:55:28,515
And this is a double.

1065
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,244
This one is twenty dollars apiece.

1066
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:33,889
You see, you get from us the ballroom,
the breakfast and the catering.

1067
00:55:34,715 --> 00:55:36,709
Now if you want hot and
cold hors d'oeuvres ..

1068
00:55:37,161 --> 00:55:38,492
Liquor, photographers ..

1069
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:39,883
Limousine service ..

1070
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:40,956
Flowers ..

1071
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:43,482
Limousine service?
- Limousines. Great idea.

1072
00:55:43,865 --> 00:55:46,870
Tom, you got to drive people who've
no cars from the church to here.

1073
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:47,865
Of course.

1074
00:55:48,222 --> 00:55:51,122
Why, it's not so far.
Twenty or thirty blocks by subway.

1075
00:55:52,492 --> 00:55:53,386
Excuse me.

1076
00:56:02,018 --> 00:56:04,264
If we're going to do this at all
we may as well do it right.

1077
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:07,274
Look Aggie, there's $4,400 in the
bank that I scrimped and saved for.

1078
00:56:07,634 --> 00:56:09,304
Over so many years to get my own cab.

1079
00:56:09,669 --> 00:56:11,854
<i>You</i> scrimped? What about me?
- So we both did.

1080
00:56:12,376 --> 00:56:14,988
So I can't see throwing
away $4,400 on one meal.

1081
00:56:15,198 --> 00:56:17,353
I'm willing to give the
girl a fancy party.

1082
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:20,813
But throwing away our life savings
on one meal. A breakfast at that.

1083
00:56:21,148 --> 00:56:21,734
No.

1084
00:56:21,944 --> 00:56:23,499
You skimped on me all my life.

1085
00:56:23,837 --> 00:56:25,279
You'll not skimp on that girl.

1086
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:27,022
I did the best I could for my kids.

1087
00:56:27,295 --> 00:56:29,278
Look Tom, we had it hard between us.

1088
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,846
But I'll not haggle and
bicker with you now.

1089
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:36,602
But this girl is going to have a wedding
she'll remember until the day she dies.

1090
00:56:37,442 --> 00:56:40,727
She's going to have a big,
white, satin photograph album.

1091
00:56:41,274 --> 00:56:43,434
That she can look at when
the bad years come.

1092
00:56:44,523 --> 00:56:47,597
And maybe then she'll have a kind
thought for her father and mother.

1093
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,420
Who've never given her nothing at all.

1094
00:56:51,122 --> 00:56:52,397
And you're as bad as me.

1095
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:56,215
But this .. she is going to have.

1096
00:56:56,982 --> 00:56:58,409
I'll tell you that.

1097
00:57:02,098 --> 00:57:03,389
So we decided.

1098
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:06,348
To hold the wake in the
Green Grass Grill itself.

1099
00:57:08,455 --> 00:57:09,471
Very funny indeed.

1100
00:57:09,681 --> 00:57:11,673
We were just discussing the guest list.

1101
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,094
You want to think it over
and come back another time?

1102
00:57:14,304 --> 00:57:15,794
No, no. This is the place.

1103
00:57:16,207 --> 00:57:18,231
Fine. Now, about the floral decorations.

1104
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:21,011
Don't we get sent flowers at a wedding?

1105
00:57:21,381 --> 00:57:24,258
Couldn't we just take the flowers
we get down here after the service?

1106
00:57:24,749 --> 00:57:27,006
Tom, you can't take
them out of the church.

1107
00:57:27,216 --> 00:57:30,160
Tom .. when you put a flower
in the church, you know ..

1108
00:57:30,753 --> 00:57:31,396
Yes.

1109
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,251
And how about the limousine service?

1110
00:57:33,558 --> 00:57:36,250
How many can you squeeze
into one of them limousines?

1111
00:57:37,024 --> 00:57:40,014
I'd say about ten, I guess.
Speaking off the top of my head.

1112
00:57:40,629 --> 00:57:42,302
Well then, we'll have ten limousines.

1113
00:57:42,678 --> 00:57:44,530
Then a hundred can ride.
- Ten?

1114
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,299
These are the wedding cake ornaments.

1115
00:57:49,197 --> 00:57:50,568
How much would that be?

1116
00:57:51,215 --> 00:57:53,356
Well, I think we should
start at the top of this list.

1117
00:57:53,835 --> 00:57:54,752
Let's see now.

1118
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,765
Six gallons of assorted cocktails
and 28 dollars a gallon.

1119
00:57:58,372 --> 00:58:01,231
28 bottles of champagne for
the toast at 6 dollars a bottle.

1120
00:58:01,441 --> 00:58:03,123
12 bottles of rye at 8 dollars a bottle.

1121
00:58:03,334 --> 00:58:05,402
12 bottles of Scotch
at 11 dollars a bottle.

1122
00:58:05,943 --> 00:58:07,148
Ten limousines.

1123
00:58:07,678 --> 00:58:09,476
An orchestra. Flowers.

1124
00:58:10,709 --> 00:58:12,425
Bridal table flowers 20 dollars.

1125
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,978
20 dollars apiece, yes.

1126
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:18,642
50 percent on the food take,
20 cents per person for the check room.

1127
00:58:19,015 --> 00:58:21,580
200 match books.
That would be 14 dollars.

1128
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:24,749
Wedding album, 25 pictures.
That's 75 dollars.

1129
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:27,417
What a day.

1130
00:58:28,236 --> 00:58:30,224
When she said Bill didn't
have a blue suit, well ..

1131
00:58:31,076 --> 00:58:32,726
She started crying.

1132
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,607
Oh, I don't know.

1133
00:58:35,403 --> 00:58:38,555
What do you do when your best
friend just breaks down and cries?

1134
00:58:39,536 --> 00:58:40,609
I don't know, honey.

1135
00:58:41,296 --> 00:58:42,454
We're in the same trap.

1136
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:44,623
I know Bill didn't have a job.

1137
00:58:45,925 --> 00:58:47,548
You know how Alice felt about things.

1138
00:58:48,448 --> 00:58:50,993
The thing is, why didn't we think of
it before we hurt their feelings?

1139
00:58:51,203 --> 00:58:52,810
It's getting to be such a mess.

1140
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:53,830
Oh.

1141
00:58:54,409 --> 00:58:57,042
Why don't you fix this thing?
It sprays all over the place.

1142
00:58:57,503 --> 00:58:59,262
Just wait until you hear
how many people ..

1143
00:58:59,493 --> 00:59:01,784
My folks have asked to the party
your old man is paying for.

1144
00:59:02,494 --> 00:59:05,296
As of this afternoon, my mother
found we were related by blood to ..

1145
00:59:05,506 --> 00:59:08,675
To 46 people, and by marriage to 81.

1146
00:59:09,401 --> 00:59:11,485
On top of that there's some
40-odd close friends ..

1147
00:59:11,767 --> 00:59:14,242
Who deserve the rare privilege
of seeing me marry you.

1148
00:59:15,136 --> 00:59:16,679
That's over 150 already.

1149
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:19,120
Oh Janie, let's leave
Tuesday like we planned.

1150
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:20,884
Leave?
- Leave.

1151
00:59:21,602 --> 00:59:23,031
What about all the arrangements?

1152
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:25,131
Cancel them. It won't kill anybody.

1153
00:59:28,437 --> 00:59:30,569
Ralph.
- Listen, Janie.

1154
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,215
Ralph, I can't. That's all.

1155
00:59:34,942 --> 00:59:37,154
Ralph, I want to do
it for Ma. That's all.

1156
00:59:41,862 --> 00:59:44,682
What do you do to your shirts?
Losing your buttons all the time.

1157
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:52,414
Ralph.

1158
00:59:55,226 --> 00:59:56,716
I was wondering today ..

1159
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,261
Listening to Ma.

1160
01:00:02,438 --> 01:00:03,583
If she and Pa ..

1161
01:00:04,669 --> 01:00:06,300
Ever said they loved each other.

1162
01:00:09,642 --> 01:00:11,003
I don't think they ever did.

1163
01:00:14,675 --> 01:00:16,139
I know they never did.

1164
01:00:20,809 --> 01:00:22,654
It's not necessarily something you say.

1165
01:00:23,478 --> 01:00:25,750
It's something you do. It's ..

1166
01:00:26,455 --> 01:00:28,142
It's the whole way you live.

1167
01:00:28,935 --> 01:00:30,102
That's love.

1168
01:00:32,231 --> 01:00:32,932
I know.

1169
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:35,213
I know, but ..

1170
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:38,880
Sometimes.

1171
01:00:39,733 --> 01:00:40,982
When things aren't said.

1172
01:00:41,964 --> 01:00:44,566
After a while they aren't true anymore.

1173
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:48,670
I don't know.

1174
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:51,256
I don't know what I believe.

1175
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,106
You mean, I never told you
what I feel about you.

1176
01:00:56,532 --> 01:00:57,468
Yes.

1177
01:00:58,206 --> 01:00:59,393
Oh yes.

1178
01:01:00,647 --> 01:01:02,407
But don't ever stop telling me.

1179
01:01:19,672 --> 01:01:22,794
If we're going to the movies,
we'd better get going. Huh?

1180
01:01:23,667 --> 01:01:24,381
Hmm.

1181
01:01:25,387 --> 01:01:27,094
You really want to go?

1182
01:01:27,905 --> 01:01:28,520
Hmm.

1183
01:01:30,294 --> 01:01:31,397
I don't know.

1184
01:01:32,158 --> 01:01:33,174
Do you want to go?

1185
01:01:36,607 --> 01:01:38,049
If you want to go.

1186
01:01:47,251 --> 01:01:47,895
Jane.

1187
01:01:53,741 --> 01:01:54,632
Ralph.

1188
01:01:55,525 --> 01:01:57,334
I think we'd better go to the movies.

1189
01:02:15,805 --> 01:02:17,185
You're up early, Ma.

1190
01:02:17,915 --> 01:02:20,585
Yeah. I'm going over the
guest list and guess what?

1191
01:02:20,854 --> 01:02:21,784
You in trouble?

1192
01:02:21,994 --> 01:02:24,263
Got the list down to 94 for our side.

1193
01:02:24,473 --> 01:02:25,834
A saving of 30 dollars.

1194
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:28,384
Tom, I saved us 30 dollars.

1195
01:02:29,022 --> 01:02:29,637
How?

1196
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:32,204
We're inviting 94 people
instead of the hundred.

1197
01:02:32,923 --> 01:02:34,986
Our 94 and the Halloran's hundred.

1198
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:35,910
No.

1199
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:38,342
Ma.
- What?

1200
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:41,068
Ralph told me his mother
is inviting about ..

1201
01:02:42,048 --> 01:02:43,516
A hundred and sixty people.

1202
01:02:44,924 --> 01:02:45,752
How many?

1203
01:02:46,249 --> 01:02:48,185
A hundred .. a hundred and sixty?

1204
01:02:49,254 --> 01:02:51,520
But I told her there would be
a hundred for each of us.

1205
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:53,421
I made a big thing yesterday.

1206
01:02:53,814 --> 01:02:55,866
A hundred and sixty?
- Ralph's mad about it too.

1207
01:02:56,142 --> 01:02:58,025
What's 160 times five dollars?
- Pa, don't ..

1208
01:02:58,378 --> 01:03:00,030
I ask for a bit of information.

1209
01:03:00,493 --> 01:03:02,311
What's 160 times five?

1210
01:03:02,649 --> 01:03:04,530
Now, Tom. Ralph must be wrong.

1211
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:09,758
160 times 5 on top of 3,100 dollars all
to be thrown down the drain on this ..

1212
01:03:09,968 --> 01:03:12,112
Criminal breakfast for
serving a bunch of strangers.

1213
01:03:12,323 --> 01:03:14,474
Now, now Tom. Relax a minute.

1214
01:03:14,684 --> 01:03:16,273
I'll call Mrs Halloran.

1215
01:03:16,664 --> 01:03:17,948
There must be a mistake.

1216
01:03:18,324 --> 01:03:19,585
There's a mistake alright.

1217
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:21,754
You're spending every
penny I ever put aside ..

1218
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:24,342
And before you're through you'll
have me up to here in debt.

1219
01:03:28,141 --> 01:03:30,389
Ma. Maybe we'd better
call the whole thing off?

1220
01:03:30,605 --> 01:03:32,204
No I won't. Anyway, we can't.

1221
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:34,016
Ralph must be wrong.

1222
01:03:36,404 --> 01:03:37,375
Mrs Halloran?

1223
01:03:38,021 --> 01:03:39,572
This is Agnes Hurley.

1224
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:42,356
Oh yeah, we're fine.

1225
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:44,502
And how are you?

1226
01:03:44,885 --> 01:03:45,994
Well that's nice.

1227
01:03:46,435 --> 01:03:49,811
Look, I was just going
over my list and I was ..

1228
01:03:50,449 --> 01:03:51,914
I was wondering about your list.

1229
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:56,183
Oh sure, I know we won't be
inviting the same people but ..

1230
01:03:57,491 --> 01:03:59,811
How many do you think you'll be asking?

1231
01:04:01,738 --> 01:04:03,206
A hundred and eighty-six?

1232
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,059
A hundred and eighty-six.
- No, no.

1233
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:11,038
No. I thought we agreed there would be
a hundred for you and a hundred for us.

1234
01:04:12,712 --> 01:04:15,215
Yeah well .. I'll be talking to you.

1235
01:04:16,326 --> 01:04:17,263
Yeah. Goodbye.

1236
01:04:23,825 --> 01:04:25,221
[ Doorbell ]

1237
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:30,744
I don't know what to say to your Pa.

1238
01:04:31,787 --> 01:04:34,761
Go and fix him some breakfast.
Maybe it will make him more peaceful.

1239
01:04:40,624 --> 01:04:41,540
Hello, Agnes.

1240
01:04:42,006 --> 01:04:43,658
Is Tom in?
- In the kitchen.

1241
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:44,822
Thanks.

1242
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,550
Jane.

1243
01:04:49,231 --> 01:04:50,046
Hello, Tom.

1244
01:04:50,301 --> 01:04:52,146
Want any breakfast, Mr Leiter.
- No thank you.

1245
01:04:52,832 --> 01:04:53,840
Well. Here I am.

1246
01:04:56,235 --> 01:04:57,122
It is Sunday.

1247
01:04:57,421 --> 01:04:59,056
Down payment on the hack.
- Oh yeah.

1248
01:04:59,534 --> 01:05:00,577
I'm sorry, Sam.

1249
01:05:01,057 --> 01:05:02,028
I forgot it.

1250
01:05:02,627 --> 01:05:03,786
I got a lot on my mind.

1251
01:05:03,996 --> 01:05:04,983
Say that's right.

1252
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:06,974
I heard you're getting married, Jane.

1253
01:05:07,348 --> 01:05:09,500
Many happy returns, I'm sure.
- Thank you.

1254
01:05:10,018 --> 01:05:11,809
Well it's a deal for
McQuade for the hack.

1255
01:05:12,419 --> 01:05:14,765
Give him the down payment.
We're in business.

1256
01:05:17,828 --> 01:05:18,444
No.

1257
01:05:18,894 --> 01:05:21,140
No I can't, Sam. I'm sorry. Not now.

1258
01:05:22,045 --> 01:05:22,780
What?

1259
01:05:23,228 --> 01:05:24,605
I .. I changed my mind.

1260
01:05:25,914 --> 01:05:27,130
You've changed your mind?

1261
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,788
For years we planned this.

1262
01:05:30,596 --> 01:05:33,427
And you change your mind.
- That's the trouble. We waited so long.

1263
01:05:33,637 --> 01:05:36,025
If you don't do it young, you pass
a point. You know what I mean.

1264
01:05:36,504 --> 01:05:37,430
No, I don't.

1265
01:05:38,394 --> 01:05:39,469
Your own business.

1266
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:41,886
You fill out all those papers
morning, noon and night.

1267
01:05:42,419 --> 01:05:43,921
So maybe you make a bit more money.

1268
01:05:46,695 --> 01:05:49,681
You work as hard as you did before
with twice the responsibility.

1269
01:05:50,462 --> 01:05:51,869
No, no Sam. Not now.

1270
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:54,140
Are you alright, Tom?

1271
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,069
Anything go wrong? Any trouble?

1272
01:05:56,388 --> 01:05:58,595
No. There's no trouble, Sam. Just time.

1273
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:01,342
There's time passing, and ..

1274
01:06:03,004 --> 01:06:04,063
Well, you know.

1275
01:06:05,968 --> 01:06:06,627
Well.

1276
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:08,692
I'd better be on my way.

1277
01:06:10,231 --> 01:06:11,288
See you around.

1278
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:12,767
Yeah, see you around.

1279
01:06:14,761 --> 01:06:16,063
You find somebody else, huh?

1280
01:06:20,784 --> 01:06:21,685
Goodbye, Jane.

1281
01:06:22,175 --> 01:06:22,964
Goodbye.

1282
01:06:23,174 --> 01:06:24,104
Goodbye, Agnes.

1283
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:26,101
What did Sam want?

1284
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,064
Ma ..

1285
01:06:27,436 --> 01:06:29,768
You two better get fixed if we're
to make 9 o'clock Mass today.

1286
01:06:30,089 --> 01:06:32,211
They're reading the Banns today.
- Everybody up?

1287
01:06:33,108 --> 01:06:34,538
There you all are.

1288
01:06:34,889 --> 01:06:36,716
As bright a picture as the day itself.

1289
01:06:37,147 --> 01:06:39,382
Getting ready for Mass.
- That's fine.

1290
01:06:40,085 --> 01:06:41,777
I mailed them invitations for you.

1291
01:06:41,987 --> 01:06:43,682
I took them personally to the mailbox.

1292
01:06:43,892 --> 01:06:45,887
Thanks. I'll mail the rest tomorrow.

1293
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,096
Oh and Tom.

1294
01:06:47,306 --> 01:06:50,836
You'll be glad to know O'Casey and
O'Reagan are coming to the reception.

1295
01:06:51,202 --> 01:06:52,912
Of course Mrs Rafferty
will be there too.

1296
01:06:53,337 --> 01:06:55,005
Three more, huh?
- I'll pay for them.

1297
01:06:55,384 --> 01:06:56,729
You asked Mrs Rafferty?

1298
01:06:57,045 --> 01:06:58,483
I did.
- But we don't know her.

1299
01:06:59,174 --> 01:07:01,256
Well she don't know you,
but she'll come.

1300
01:07:01,872 --> 01:07:03,759
Jack, I'm sure she's nice and all ..

1301
01:07:04,304 --> 01:07:05,616
You know she's nice?

1302
01:07:06,479 --> 01:07:07,123
Well.

1303
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,456
What do you think of me
saying a thing like that?

1304
01:07:09,751 --> 01:07:11,162
Don't get on your high horse.

1305
01:07:11,439 --> 01:07:12,401
Let me tell you.

1306
01:07:12,784 --> 01:07:15,149
There will be no Casey or
Reagan and no Mrs Rafferty.

1307
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:17,903
Look here, Tom. You always ..
- Ah, shut up.

1308
01:07:18,384 --> 01:07:19,971
And don't go shouting at Jack.

1309
01:07:20,181 --> 01:07:21,511
I'll shout at whoever I want.

1310
01:07:21,811 --> 01:07:24,769
Fine. If that's the way you feel,
I'll not go to the wedding.

1311
01:07:25,168 --> 01:07:27,555
I'll not sleep another
night in this house.

1312
01:07:27,997 --> 01:07:28,845
Goodbye.

1313
01:07:31,321 --> 01:07:32,564
Now look what you've done.

1314
01:07:32,774 --> 01:07:33,549
Aggie ..

1315
01:07:34,006 --> 01:07:35,022
We're poor people.

1316
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:39,162
A table of caviar for a bunch of people
who'd be happy enough with corned beef.

1317
01:07:39,372 --> 01:07:42,612
And carting them around in
limousines like they was landlords.

1318
01:07:43,038 --> 01:07:46,879
Tom, my head is splitting with
all this bickering and haggling.

1319
01:07:47,117 --> 01:07:48,872
And what about my head, Aggie? Huh?

1320
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:51,139
You've always ragged me
about what a miser I am.

1321
01:07:51,948 --> 01:07:55,100
I've found dollars hard to come by
and I'm leery of letting them go.

1322
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:58,618
And I'm sick of being put up in front of
my children as a penny-pinching miser.

1323
01:07:59,011 --> 01:08:00,688
Of denying them college educations.

1324
01:08:01,056 --> 01:08:02,299
I done the best I could.

1325
01:08:02,509 --> 01:08:04,017
It was never good enough for you.

1326
01:08:04,227 --> 01:08:05,645
Stop it!
- Never good enough.

1327
01:08:05,934 --> 01:08:07,035
Stop it. Both of you.

1328
01:08:07,297 --> 01:08:08,942
Friday we decided to have a big wedding.

1329
01:08:09,152 --> 01:08:11,045
And in two days my best
friend Alice hates me.

1330
01:08:11,374 --> 01:08:13,636
My uncle moves out.
My mother and father are breaking up.

1331
01:08:14,058 --> 01:08:16,106
I've lost my honeymoon.
Pa's lost his cab ..

1332
01:08:16,316 --> 01:08:18,472
Ralph is so sore he may walk
out on the whole thing.

1333
01:08:20,576 --> 01:08:21,162
So.

1334
01:08:21,779 --> 01:08:23,512
Let's call the whole thing off.

1335
01:08:24,028 --> 01:08:27,474
I know we put $50 down on the ballroom
and $50 down on the bridal gown.

1336
01:08:27,684 --> 01:08:31,388
50 dollars? For the love of heaven if it
is $50 down, how much will this come to?

1337
01:08:31,598 --> 01:08:32,268
Okay!

1338
01:08:33,263 --> 01:08:34,779
Okay, we're calling it off.

1339
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,213
The invitations went out this morning.

1340
01:08:38,525 --> 01:08:40,656
We'll have to write everybody
and say the plans changed.

1341
01:08:40,884 --> 01:08:44,302
Uncle Harry is coming from Virginia.
- Okay, so maybe it's embarrassing.

1342
01:08:44,717 --> 01:08:48,612
But it's better than having Pa go broke
and Ralph and me lose our honeymoon.

1343
01:08:48,822 --> 01:08:50,897
Alright, alright.
We won't have a wedding.

1344
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,149
Alright.

1345
01:09:00,777 --> 01:09:01,526
Ma.

1346
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:04,770
I understand why you wanted the
big wedding and I appreciate it.

1347
01:09:05,276 --> 01:09:06,403
I swear I do.

1348
01:09:07,784 --> 01:09:08,456
Right.

1349
01:09:10,833 --> 01:09:12,049
I'll call the Hallorans.

1350
01:09:12,394 --> 01:09:14,145
No .. I'll call them.

1351
01:09:14,993 --> 01:09:16,266
It's my place to call them.

1352
01:09:20,658 --> 01:09:22,422
Well .. I'll go call Halloran.

1353
01:09:35,996 --> 01:09:36,672
Ma.

1354
01:09:38,962 --> 01:09:41,102
Get your clothes. It's time for Mass.

1355
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:01,717
Mrs Halloran?

1356
01:10:06,971 --> 01:10:09,371
No consideration.
No gratitude. No loyalty.

1357
01:10:09,988 --> 01:10:11,947
Vanity, all the time, vanity.
- Hello there, Jack.

1358
01:10:12,157 --> 01:10:13,000
Hello there.

1359
01:10:14,567 --> 01:10:16,140
You look quite hearty, Mr Conlon.

1360
01:10:16,852 --> 01:10:20,778
What I've been through this last
hour has aged me a hundred years.

1361
01:10:21,581 --> 01:10:22,740
A jigger of rye, Jimmy.

1362
01:10:23,114 --> 01:10:25,040
Isn't it a bit early for you, Mr Conlon?

1363
01:10:25,295 --> 01:10:29,230
It's my heart. Bad palpitations brought
on by the unkindness of others.

1364
01:10:29,894 --> 01:10:30,795
What happened?

1365
01:10:31,005 --> 01:10:32,531
I'm leaving that house for good.

1366
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:34,396
Oh?

1367
01:10:34,989 --> 01:10:38,503
No consideration,
no gratitude, no loyalty.

1368
01:10:38,736 --> 01:10:40,358
That does sound bad.

1369
01:10:41,176 --> 01:10:45,885
Ah, Mrs Rafferty, today I've seen all
the blackness of the human heart.

1370
01:10:46,177 --> 01:10:48,466
And it had to do with your inviting me.

1371
01:10:48,862 --> 01:10:49,563
It had.

1372
01:10:51,535 --> 01:10:53,065
I appreciate it, Mr Conlon.

1373
01:10:53,581 --> 01:10:56,245
You know, I think that sister
of mine is losing her senses.

1374
01:10:56,695 --> 01:10:58,282
I was the one who planned the wedding.

1375
01:10:58,492 --> 01:11:00,280
I was the one who made
all the arrangements.

1376
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,203
Interviewed the caterers. And my reward?

1377
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:07,702
I asked to bring my best
friend in all the world.

1378
01:11:08,623 --> 01:11:10,105
And there's this ugly quarrel.

1379
01:11:10,315 --> 01:11:13,312
Well .. it will be alright again, soon.

1380
01:11:13,591 --> 01:11:14,950
Yes, but I'm still moving out.

1381
01:11:17,618 --> 01:11:19,222
But where one earth would I go?

1382
01:11:20,236 --> 01:11:20,995
Well ..

1383
01:11:21,858 --> 01:11:23,286
It just happens.

1384
01:11:23,766 --> 01:11:26,362
I know this place not a stone's
throw from where we're sitting.

1385
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,258
A room?
- A small apartment.

1386
01:11:29,998 --> 01:11:30,708
And ..

1387
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:32,052
And ..

1388
01:11:32,897 --> 01:11:35,033
It's a nice sized place.

1389
01:11:37,623 --> 01:11:38,992
Big enough for two.

1390
01:11:39,555 --> 01:11:40,492
For two?

1391
01:11:44,294 --> 01:11:45,743
I'll say no more, Mr Conlon.

1392
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:49,556
Ah, for two did you say, Mrs Rafferty?

1393
01:11:50,652 --> 01:11:51,355
I did.

1394
01:11:51,915 --> 01:11:53,902
And be willing to leave your
married daughters out?

1395
01:11:54,112 --> 01:11:54,876
I would.

1396
01:11:56,032 --> 01:11:56,968
Hey.

1397
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,605
Yeah, and two can live as cheap as one.

1398
01:11:59,823 --> 01:12:01,458
So I've always heard, Mr Conlon.

1399
01:12:02,015 --> 01:12:03,587
Well, now things look very bright.

1400
01:12:04,002 --> 01:12:05,073
They do at that.

1401
01:12:05,786 --> 01:12:06,945
A jigger of rye, Jimmy.

1402
01:12:07,266 --> 01:12:08,452
Shall we have a game?

1403
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:10,737
Yes. Let's have a game to celebrate.

1404
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:12,284
Two Canastas to go out?

1405
01:12:12,557 --> 01:12:14,009
And pick up two cards.

1406
01:12:17,228 --> 01:12:19,398
It's a grand day after
all, Mrs Rafferty.

1407
01:12:19,797 --> 01:12:21,345
It is, Mr Conlon.

1408
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,586
Hi.

1409
01:12:32,856 --> 01:12:34,531
Hi Alice, Bill.

1410
01:12:34,764 --> 01:12:36,323
How are you, Bill?
- And you, Ralph?

1411
01:12:36,533 --> 01:12:37,757
Fine. Just fine, Bill.

1412
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,341
Come now. What's so exciting you
couldn't tell me on the phone?

1413
01:12:41,814 --> 01:12:42,788
A job.

1414
01:12:43,721 --> 01:12:45,790
Bill has a job with an
insurance company.

1415
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:47,583
Yeah.

1416
01:12:47,956 --> 01:12:50,497
The one I put in for last
year .. it came through.

1417
01:12:50,828 --> 01:12:52,015
It finally came through.

1418
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,968
So I can get the dress,
and Bill can get the suit.

1419
01:12:57,772 --> 01:12:59,963
And I can be your Matron of Honor
like we always wanted.

1420
01:13:00,173 --> 01:13:00,939
Alice.

1421
01:13:03,104 --> 01:13:05,148
Alice, there isn't going
to be any big weddings.

1422
01:13:06,134 --> 01:13:07,121
What do you mean?

1423
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:09,941
It was all set.

1424
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,823
We're getting married tomorrow,
like we always planned.

1425
01:13:14,593 --> 01:13:16,499
I was going to call
you tonight to tell you.

1426
01:13:17,985 --> 01:13:20,399
Just wear what you always wear.

1427
01:13:22,575 --> 01:13:24,077
Gee, it's kind of a shame isn't it.

1428
01:13:24,824 --> 01:13:25,835
What's a shame?

1429
01:13:26,776 --> 01:13:28,583
Not having the big wedding and all.

1430
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:30,771
Jane, your mother ..?

1431
01:13:31,603 --> 01:13:32,669
It's okay with her?

1432
01:13:33,487 --> 01:13:34,295
Sure.

1433
01:13:34,519 --> 01:13:35,711
Sure it is.

1434
01:13:36,562 --> 01:13:38,257
Ma is the practical one in the family.

1435
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,147
It was her idea to call it off.

1436
01:13:49,334 --> 01:13:51,128
Let's dance. Okay?
- Sure.

1437
01:13:57,684 --> 01:13:58,757
He hasn't got a job.

1438
01:13:59,630 --> 01:14:00,614
No. I know.

1439
01:14:01,538 --> 01:14:05,127
They probably borrowed the money for
the organdie dress and the blue suit.

1440
01:14:12,326 --> 01:14:13,227
Jane, darling.

1441
01:14:14,727 --> 01:14:15,914
Your Ma will be alright.

1442
01:14:18,572 --> 01:14:20,430
I'll never forget the look on her face.

1443
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:23,413
When I told her we weren't
having a big wedding.

1444
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:27,746
I'll never forget the way she looked.

1445
01:14:29,744 --> 01:14:31,429
Like I'd hit her in the face.
- Shush.

1446
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:37,771
I keep thinking about that house.

1447
01:14:40,206 --> 01:14:41,336
The two of them alone.

1448
01:14:43,387 --> 01:14:45,386
Living there the rest of their lives.

1449
01:14:47,159 --> 01:14:48,153
Never talking.

1450
01:14:49,325 --> 01:14:50,542
Never loving each other.

1451
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:53,421
Ralph.

1452
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:57,441
We'll never be like that.
- No, honey.

1453
01:15:05,948 --> 01:15:07,267
Why hello there, Tom.

1454
01:15:07,758 --> 01:15:09,421
Is Aggie about?
- She's in the bedroom.

1455
01:15:10,332 --> 01:15:11,576
Are you really moving out?

1456
01:15:11,814 --> 01:15:14,549
Yes, sir. Jack Conlon's word
is as good as his bond.

1457
01:15:15,087 --> 01:15:15,952
Jack, I ..

1458
01:15:17,193 --> 01:15:18,629
I guess you know what you want.

1459
01:15:18,996 --> 01:15:21,611
I tell you I think we'd be
a little pinched for space.

1460
01:15:21,973 --> 01:15:25,111
With you and Aggie and
me and Mrs Conlon.

1461
01:15:26,334 --> 01:15:27,954
'Mrs' Conlon?
- Yes, sir.

1462
01:15:28,337 --> 01:15:31,029
Mrs Rafferty has finally
consented to be my wife.

1463
01:15:31,869 --> 01:15:34,107
Jack, that's wonderful.
Glad to hear the news.

1464
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:38,076
Yes, I decided to narrow my activities
from the whole wide world ..

1465
01:15:38,423 --> 01:15:39,604
Down to Mrs Rafferty.

1466
01:15:39,932 --> 01:15:41,386
I didn't think you had the nerve.

1467
01:15:42,228 --> 01:15:43,790
It was quite painless.

1468
01:15:44,213 --> 01:15:45,997
I didn't feel a thing.
- Hey, Aggie.

1469
01:15:46,410 --> 01:15:47,654
Jack's getting married.

1470
01:15:48,716 --> 01:15:50,336
What do you think of the news, Aggie?

1471
01:15:52,232 --> 01:15:54,655
That's very nice.
- We'll have some beer to celebrate.

1472
01:15:56,346 --> 01:15:59,402
Some other time. You see, we're moving
into the new apartment tonight.

1473
01:15:59,717 --> 01:16:01,368
This <i>is</i> a surprise.

1474
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:04,034
Yeah. There's that element in it.

1475
01:16:05,855 --> 01:16:07,591
Where's the place you're moving to?

1476
01:16:08,337 --> 01:16:10,362
About six blocks as the crow flies.

1477
01:16:11,063 --> 01:16:13,986
And we'll be over often enough. And you
can come over to see us too, of course.

1478
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:14,954
Sure.

1479
01:16:15,461 --> 01:16:18,499
You know, ever since my decision
in relation to Mrs Rafferty.

1480
01:16:19,017 --> 01:16:22,776
I've been seeing things in what
you might call a new light.

1481
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:26,942
What am I, I ask you after 61 years?

1482
01:16:27,152 --> 01:16:28,560
An uncle. That's all.

1483
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:32,028
No children. No grandchildren.
No wife of my own.

1484
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:34,301
No home where I belong. No ..

1485
01:16:34,613 --> 01:16:35,356
Jack.

1486
01:16:35,935 --> 01:16:36,968
This is your home.

1487
01:16:37,291 --> 01:16:39,294
Ah no. It's yours and Tom's.

1488
01:16:39,752 --> 01:16:42,360
I've just been scavenging
here for a bit of warmth ..

1489
01:16:42,649 --> 01:16:45,263
I should have found long ago
with somebody like Mrs Rafferty.

1490
01:16:45,863 --> 01:16:47,779
And you know, if it
wasn't for this breakup ..

1491
01:16:48,195 --> 01:16:51,173
I'd have gone on being just an
uncle for the rest of my days.

1492
01:16:53,996 --> 01:16:56,380
Look, you're not rushing into this
because of what happened?

1493
01:16:56,929 --> 01:16:58,986
There's not going to be any
big wedding you know.

1494
01:16:59,988 --> 01:17:02,022
Everything is going to
be like it was before.

1495
01:17:02,499 --> 01:17:04,024
Sure it is. Sure it is.

1496
01:17:04,368 --> 01:17:06,614
And we'll be nearby, hopping
over whenever you like.

1497
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:07,867
Eating in, mostly.

1498
01:17:08,261 --> 01:17:11,908
Because restaurants all have fried
food that don't agree with me at all.

1499
01:17:13,098 --> 01:17:17,120
Look Aggie, for some peculiar reason the
world seems to be divided into pairs.

1500
01:17:17,904 --> 01:17:21,232
There's little Janie and her Ralph.
There's me and Mrs Rafferty.

1501
01:17:21,628 --> 01:17:23,492
And there's you and Tom.

1502
01:17:24,391 --> 01:17:26,426
You've got him. He's got you.

1503
01:17:36,761 --> 01:17:37,962
Yeah. That's fine, Jack.

1504
01:18:06,627 --> 01:18:08,376
Well Aggie my girl, I'm on my way.

1505
01:18:14,085 --> 01:18:14,770
Aggie.

1506
01:18:15,871 --> 01:18:17,331
I'll talk to her, Jack.
- Yeah.

1507
01:18:22,026 --> 01:18:24,016
See you at the church.
- Okay.

1508
01:19:01,284 --> 01:19:02,117
Aggie.

1509
01:19:09,124 --> 01:19:09,935
Aggie.

1510
01:19:15,085 --> 01:19:15,874
Well.

1511
01:19:16,716 --> 01:19:19,345
That was a dumb .. thing to do.

1512
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:36,151
You feel alright now?

1513
01:19:36,726 --> 01:19:37,747
Yes. Sure.

1514
01:19:38,419 --> 01:19:39,120
Sure.

1515
01:19:46,385 --> 01:19:48,510
Has Jack gone?
- Yeah, he's gone.

1516
01:19:52,099 --> 01:19:53,034
Turn around.

1517
01:20:00,293 --> 01:20:02,173
Jane not home yet?

1518
01:20:03,094 --> 01:20:03,717
No.

1519
01:20:05,783 --> 01:20:07,256
Aggie, what's the matter with you?

1520
01:20:07,759 --> 01:20:09,220
I cried, for Pete's sake.

1521
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:11,296
That's all. I cried. So what?

1522
01:20:12,542 --> 01:20:15,290
Aggie, don't feel that ..
- I don't want to talk about none of it.

1523
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:17,916
Aggie, you've gone right off
your rocker over this wedding.

1524
01:20:18,126 --> 01:20:19,247
It's <i>not</i> the wedding.

1525
01:20:19,459 --> 01:20:21,085
You're a senseless and stupid man.

1526
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,872
You don't care your daughter is
getting married. Not a living thing.

1527
01:20:25,082 --> 01:20:26,172
Alright, alright.

1528
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:28,455
I just wanted to do a
little something for her.

1529
01:20:28,927 --> 01:20:30,597

That's all I ever get out of you.
The sharp edge of your tongue.

About the times I wanted to

To pack a bag and go to Arizona

it's a living shame ..

That my only living daughter comes up
to me and says I want to go to college.

01:31:18,456 --> 01:31:19,615
It's like a day, Aggie.

1703
01:31:26,173 --> 01:31:28,334
Come on, wash your face. We're late.

1704
01:31:41,187 --> 01:31:42,257
Hurry up, Tom.

1705
01:31:54,831 --> 01:31:55,882
Mister Leiter.

1706
01:31:58,230 --> 01:31:59,377
Sam, this is Aggie.

1707
01:32:02,203 --> 01:32:03,387
Yeah, about the taxi.

1708
01:32:07,653 --> 01:32:08,844
Taxi, mister?

1709
01:32:18,601 --> 01:32:21,284
What are you doing here?
- Taking you to church in a new cab.

1710
01:32:22,042 --> 01:32:22,914
Right, Agnes?

1711
01:33:31,172 --> 01:33:32,140
..s-d..
