2
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,294
She lives.

3
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:42,737
She breaths.

4
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:43,479
Come on.

5
00:01:47,613 --> 00:01:48,658
She speaks.

6
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:56,492
Rach,

7
00:01:58,058 --> 00:01:59,538
did you break up?

8
00:02:12,377 --> 00:02:13,768
He met someone else.

9
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,205
In front of all his
friends he just told me

10
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:17,598
"I met someone else."

11
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,730
So I just left.

12
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:22,690
He didn't even
give me a warning.

13
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:26,086
Let alone a chance to
even say how I feel.

14
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:31,742
I did everything for him.

15
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:33,222
Oh, I know.

16
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:36,007
You've just got to put a
positive spin on it, right?

17
00:02:36,009 --> 00:02:37,269
You'll have plenty
to write about.

18
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:38,183
You know what?

19
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:39,750
I'm just going to call him.

20
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:41,491
I'm going to say "You
made a terrible mistake"...

21
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,624
No you won't, because
you lost your boyfriend,

22
00:02:43,626 --> 00:02:44,973
do you want to lose
your dignity too?

23
00:02:44,975 --> 00:02:46,757
I just need closure.

24
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,107
He doesn't want you.

25
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:50,935
Why is that not closure enough?

26
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,242
Please
just let me call him.

27
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:55,070
I just want to hear his voice.

28
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:55,853
Serious?

29
00:02:55,855 --> 00:02:56,811
Move along, people!

30
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:57,638
Nothing to see here!

31
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,596
Give her a break!

32
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,644
She just got dumped
by a guy named Goux.

33
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:05,125
What did you say?

34
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:09,040
His last name is Goux.

35
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:10,651
It's French.

36
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:11,652
I don't care.

37
00:03:11,654 --> 00:03:12,870
What?

38
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:13,871
Are you going to marry
a guy named Goux?

39
00:03:13,873 --> 00:03:15,656
Be Rachel Goux?

40
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:16,787
Oh.

41
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:17,701
Pardon me, Mr. and Mrs. Goux.

42
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:18,789
Yeah, your table is ready.

43
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,312
Okay, Nicole.

44
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:22,010
Plus, he's a straight up goo.

45
00:03:22,012 --> 00:03:24,316
Like, I'm very surprised
that he found someone else

46
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,275
because who the hell
would want to be with him?

47
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:27,450
I want to be with him?

48
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:28,235
Why?

49
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,847
You are talented.

50
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,196
You are intelligent.

51
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:35,676
You can be very funny

52
00:03:35,678 --> 00:03:38,635
when you're not throwing
yourself a pity party.

53
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:40,985
Although I do see how this
can be funny from like a

54
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,421
tragic point of view.

55
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:43,207
Mmm mmm.

56
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,862
You're beautiful.

57
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:49,124
Okay?

58
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:51,517
You're going to find
somebody worthy of you.

59
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,303
He's not.

60
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:54,610
He's a goo.

61
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,133
More bubbles.

62
00:03:58,135 --> 00:03:59,395
Yeah, you want
some more champagne?

63
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:00,309
Yeah.

64
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:01,049
Bottomless mimosas for you.

65
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:01,963
I want...

66
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:02,877
Ah, we found the bottom.

67
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,835
There is no bottom, nope.

68
00:04:04,837 --> 00:04:06,402
I'm going to go
upstairs and change

69
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:08,665
because I've been wearing the
same clothes for 31 hours.

70
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:09,448
You know what?

71
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,232
You smell like it.

72
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:11,015
Oh, thank you.

73
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:11,799
Awesome.

74
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:12,843
Fuck you.

75
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:14,279
Oh, I love you too.

76
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:15,065
Kisses.

77
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,651
What the fuck?

78
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:39,740
Nicole, where's my bed?

79
00:04:39,742 --> 00:04:41,176
Fuck.

80
00:04:41,178 --> 00:04:41,959
I'm sorry?

81
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:42,743
What's that?

82
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:43,787
I can't hear you.

83
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:46,703
You got rid of my bed?

84
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:47,965
About that.

85
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:50,402
Um, you weren't living here.

86
00:04:50,404 --> 00:04:52,274
I was paying rent.

87
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:54,798
I wanted a meditation space.

88
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,582
You can't even sit
still for five seconds.

89
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:57,453
How are you going to meditate?

90
00:04:57,455 --> 00:04:58,367
Are you kidding?

91
00:04:58,369 --> 00:04:59,673
Look at me, I'm Zen as fuck.

92
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,849
You can literally
mediate anywhere.

93
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:02,980
Okay.

94
00:05:02,982 --> 00:05:04,895
I'm going to be real with you.

95
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:08,420
I traded your bed for an ounce
of weed and an army jacket.

96
00:05:08,422 --> 00:05:09,726
You traded it for what?

97
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:10,684
For an ounce of weed
and an army jacket.

98
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:11,946
An army jacket?

99
00:05:11,948 --> 00:05:13,774
It's vintage from
one of the world wars.

100
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:17,516
Well I hope it's bulletproof
because that bed was $4,000.

101
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,780
And a graduation gift
from my great aunt,

102
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:21,738
who is recently deceased.

103
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,698
So, namaste.

104
00:05:24,787 --> 00:05:27,875
I'm tapping into my
third eye chakra right now,

105
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:30,312
and I'm getting the
feeling that you're upset.

106
00:05:30,314 --> 00:05:31,748
But you're going
to share my bed,

107
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,923
and we're going to
be cuddle buddies,

108
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:35,796
and it's going to be awesome.

109
00:05:35,798 --> 00:05:38,233
You're buying me a new bed.

110
00:05:39,497 --> 00:05:40,322
Who's that?

111
00:05:40,324 --> 00:05:41,802
It's Cameron.

112
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:42,803
What the fuck?

113
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:43,804
We had plans, motherfucker.

114
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:44,935
The world doesn't stop spinning

115
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:46,415
because you got dumped by a goo.

116
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:47,982
Oh, great.

117
00:05:47,984 --> 00:05:51,376
Because what I really wanted
to hear was a 28-year-old loser

118
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:55,818
from Bed-Stuy wax philosophically
about existentialism.

119
00:05:58,037 --> 00:05:59,776
Oh hi, Cameron!

120
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:02,170
Rachel, a pleasure, as always.

121
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:03,824
Oh take off your shoes.

122
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:05,477
We wouldn't want
any track marks.

123
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:07,958
Ha, ha, cute, cute.

124
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,178
So, what are we
celebrating, girls?

125
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,963
Oh, we are actually
celebrating Rachel,

126
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:14,619
who has just today

127
00:06:15,925 --> 00:06:19,796
been emancipated from the
shackles of Richard Goux's

128
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:22,190
oppressive regimentation.

129
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:24,627
Free at last, free at last!

130
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:27,848
Thank God almighty we are free!

131
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,458
To freedom.

132
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,157
And to getting along?

133
00:06:40,863 --> 00:06:43,472
So what did you even like
about that guy, anyway?

134
00:06:43,474 --> 00:06:45,693
I don't know, stability?

135
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,912
Yeah, well you're
better off without him.

136
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:50,827
Thanks, Cameron.

137
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:52,263
Have you been
with anyone since?

138
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,483
What do you mean "been with"?

139
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:57,703
You know, "known"
in the Biblical sense.

140
00:06:57,705 --> 00:06:58,966
I don't know, lain with.

141
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:00,881
We broke up this morning.

142
00:07:00,883 --> 00:07:03,057
It's never too early
for a rebound fuck.

143
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:04,275
That's like the whole point.

144
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:07,278
Oh you would, wouldn't you?

145
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,890
I'm far from ready for that.

146
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:11,108
What do you got
to get ready for?

147
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,894
You just lay down
and spread your legs.

148
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:15,723
Emotionally ready.

149
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:19,682
This just further
proves my theory.

150
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:21,947
And which theory is that?

151
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,862
That women can't
separate sex from emotion.

152
00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:27,908
Whereas men can.

153
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,300
Why?

154
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:30,998
Because of the primal
urge to spread their seed?

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,783
Misogynistic bullshit.

156
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:35,872
Hey, I'm not a
misogynist, okay?

157
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:37,265
I love women.

158
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,049
Okay, that's real rich.

159
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:39,835
Thank you.

160
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:45,795
So let me
get this straight.

161
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:47,928
You can have sex with somebody,

162
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,017
and never think
about them again?

163
00:07:50,019 --> 00:07:50,931
Correct.

164
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,193
I don't understand.

165
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:53,890
I don't
expect you to.

166
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:55,500
You're a woman.

167
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:56,719
I don't see what
that has to do with anything.

168
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:59,113
It's just sex.

169
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:00,201
Okay, pardon me, excuse me.

170
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:02,856
I have, I have a question.

171
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:05,815
Is that how you justify
having fucked a dude?

172
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:06,729
Oh, come on.

173
00:08:06,731 --> 00:08:07,599
Wait, you fucked a dude?

174
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:08,818
I did not fuck a dude.

175
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,689
Oh, that's right,
he fucked you.

176
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:11,952
Wait, so he fucked
you or did you...

177
00:08:11,954 --> 00:08:12,996
He did not fuck me.

178
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:14,868
Just tell her the story.

179
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,956
Okay.

180
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:16,739
Fine.

181
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:17,522
Yes.

182
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:19,526
Story time.

183
00:08:20,832 --> 00:08:23,485
So, we had this gig in
Chelsea and afterwards

184
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,791
I'm hanging out at the bar
and this guy comes up to me

185
00:08:25,793 --> 00:08:27,968
and asks if I want to come
over and do some coke?

186
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,099
So I told him "Yeah."

187
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:30,448
Naturally.

188
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,190
And he says to me
"Hey, I really like feet.

189
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:34,409
"Is that okay with you?"

190
00:08:34,411 --> 00:08:35,714
Yes.

191
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,542
So I was just like "Whatever."

192
00:08:37,544 --> 00:08:38,979
We're sitting on his
couch and after, you know,

193
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:40,328
a few lines of coke,
he comes up to me

194
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,983
and he removes my shoes.

195
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:44,375
And I'm thinking, like,

196
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:45,376
"Okay, he's going to give
me like a foot massage

197
00:08:45,378 --> 00:08:46,464
"or something like that."

198
00:08:46,466 --> 00:08:48,249
So then he pulls
down his pants...

199
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:50,207
His dick rock hard!

200
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:53,080
He takes my feet, presses
them together, spits on it,

201
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:56,126
and proceeds to fuck the
hole in between my feet.

202
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:56,953
No.

203
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:57,867
It gets better.

204
00:08:57,869 --> 00:08:59,086
Just as he's about to finish,

205
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:02,002
he looks me dead in
the eyes and he says.

206
00:09:02,004 --> 00:09:04,656
"Did you
ever do this with your dad?"

207
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:05,962
No!

208
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:07,616
He fucking cums
all over my pant leg.

209
00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:08,619
Oh my God.

210
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:13,230
So what's the moral
to this little story?

211
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:15,450
That men can separate
sex from emotion.

212
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:18,366
Hence the phrase
"It's just sex."

213
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:22,109
I'm not sure that that
is the moral to that story.

214
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:24,850
Yeah, it also
sounds pretty gay.

215
00:09:24,852 --> 00:09:26,026
True

216
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:27,636
Yeah, well, you know,

217
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:30,030
that's just a misconception of
gender roles in our society.

218
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:32,075
Well I suppose you think
like when two girls hook up

219
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:36,210
with one another they're
just having a little fun?

220
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:37,298
Don't think I forgot
about that little

221
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,039
lesbian rendezvous you had.

222
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,214
What?

223
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:42,607
You hooked up with a girl?!

224
00:09:42,609 --> 00:09:44,696
Yah, that little curly
haired number from the studio.

225
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:46,133
Wait, Naomi?

226
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:47,351
She's old.

227
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,832
Cunnilingus knows
no age, only beauty.

228
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,007
I can't believe you
never told me this.

229
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,009
Because it's meaningless.

230
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:54,837
Contrary to popular belief,

231
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:58,188
women can have sex
without emotion.

232
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,234
I want to know every detail.

233
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:02,149
You know what?

234
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:03,280
Why don't I just show you?

235
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:04,542
What?

236
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:06,240
Wait, wait, what are you doing?

237
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:09,025
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about!

238
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:11,071
Let me see them feet!

239
00:10:11,073 --> 00:10:11,897
No!

240
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:13,029
Yeah, yeah girl.

241
00:10:13,031 --> 00:10:13,814
Oh yeah!

242
00:10:15,077 --> 00:10:17,947
My feet are
virgins, and sacred.

243
00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:20,558
Well, it was much more
romantic that that, okay?

244
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,997
We were on cocaine.

245
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:26,869
Hey.

246
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:28,262
Hmm?

247
00:10:28,264 --> 00:10:29,611
Keep your chin up kid.

248
00:10:29,613 --> 00:10:30,786
Thanks, Cameron.

249
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:33,138
I'll see you at Nicole's show?

250
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,327
I miss you.

251
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:52,460
Nicole.

252
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:53,854
Stay.

253
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:56,116
Please?

254
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,740
Alright, drunky.

255
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:13,874
I'll see you, okay?

256
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,819
How do you do that?

257
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:48,387
Do what?

258
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:51,216
See him, still?

259
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:57,353
Rach, we are artists,

260
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:02,314
with tortured souls.

261
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:09,147
Much of the torture
is self-inflicted.

262
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,639
What are you doing?

263
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:25,857
Are you taking a selfie?

264
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:27,903
Mmm hmmm, I look good.

265
00:12:27,905 --> 00:12:28,947
Well use a filter.

266
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:29,733
Okay.

267
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:33,169
I can't believe
you got rid of my bed.

268
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:34,607
Like who does that?

269
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:36,392
You bitch.

270
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:38,609
Actually that's pretty good.

271
00:12:38,611 --> 00:12:40,133
Keep doing that.

272
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,743
Is this
what you did to Naomi?

273
00:12:41,745 --> 00:12:43,048
No.

274
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,660
This, this is
what I did to Naomi.

275
00:12:45,662 --> 00:12:46,487
Ah, you're killing me!

276
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:48,053
Uh huh, go to sleep!

277
00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:48,837
I can't breathe, really.

278
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,273
Sleepy time.

279
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:54,018
- I actually can't breath.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

280
00:13:03,593 --> 00:13:06,204
I really loved him.

281
00:13:07,074 --> 00:13:07,858
I know.

282
00:13:29,271 --> 00:13:30,272
Shit.

283
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:32,883
Shit.

284
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:35,623
Shit.

285
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:36,841
Shit.

286
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:38,147
Ugh, shit!

287
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:39,409
Relax!

288
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:41,411
I took the liberty of
calling in for you.

289
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:42,760
You what?

290
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:44,284
I told them you
ate some bad sushi

291
00:13:44,286 --> 00:13:45,285
and it's coming
out of both ends.

292
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:46,895
Good.

293
00:13:46,897 --> 00:13:47,939
Well I'm glad you told them it
was coming out of both ends.

294
00:13:47,941 --> 00:13:49,898
Well I had to sell it.

295
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,160
You're welcome.

296
00:13:51,162 --> 00:13:52,640
And now you can come
to work with me.

297
00:13:52,642 --> 00:13:54,468
Oh, you have a job?

298
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,296
Did anyone ever tell
you you are such a

299
00:13:56,298 --> 00:13:58,385
precious gem when
you are hung over?

300
00:13:58,387 --> 00:13:59,344
Here you go.

301
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:02,606
Ugh, I can't even
look at this shit.

302
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,697
Don't look, just drink.

303
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:08,133
Hurry up.

304
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:09,267
Brush your hair.

305
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:12,749
You brush your hair.

306
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:24,717
Yes.

307
00:14:27,981 --> 00:14:29,590
You hooked
up with a girl?

308
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:31,635
Yeah, that curly
haired number from the studio.

309
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,509
Wait, Naomi?

310
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:38,381
Rach?

311
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:39,210
Hmm?

312
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:50,480
Let's get you into
outfit number two.

313
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:51,438
Everybody else take 10.

314
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,876
Oh, thank God.

315
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:55,139
Excuse me.

316
00:14:58,621 --> 00:14:59,924
Yeah, yeah, indeed.

317
00:14:59,926 --> 00:15:01,796
Yep, we are a full
service studio.

318
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:03,711
We do offer hair and makeup.

319
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:05,365
Yeah we do have hair
and makeup, absolutely.

320
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,282
Stylists if you need.

321
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:11,371
Okay, I have you on the books
for Naomi on December 18th.

322
00:15:11,373 --> 00:15:12,415
Good bye.

323
00:15:12,417 --> 00:15:13,462
Shit.

324
00:15:20,904 --> 00:15:21,687
Hung over?

325
00:15:22,819 --> 00:15:24,342
Understatement.

326
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,561
Are you comfortable
down there, or...

327
00:15:27,563 --> 00:15:31,523
Yeah, I like the way the
cement feels on my body.

328
00:15:32,524 --> 00:15:34,307
Want a cigarette?

329
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,094
Oh, I don't smoke
but thank you.

330
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:39,923
Oh.

331
00:15:41,794 --> 00:15:43,141
Oh, thank you.

332
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:43,927
Yeah.

333
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,148
It's been awhile.

334
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,327
Yeah, I've been
kind of off the radar,

335
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:55,763
I guess you could say.

336
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:57,852
Back and better
than ever, I see.

337
00:15:57,854 --> 00:16:01,290
Yeah, I mean it takes true
talent to hold a bounce board.

338
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:02,987
All that geometry.

339
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:05,381
Hey, and don't
forget my astoundingly

340
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:07,470
strong tricep muscles.

341
00:16:07,472 --> 00:16:09,342
Yeah, you make it
look really easy.

342
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:10,386
You're welcome.

343
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:14,827
Hey, so I'm
doing this reading,

344
00:16:17,482 --> 00:16:19,482
and yeah, you should come.

345
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:21,136
What are you reading?

346
00:16:21,138 --> 00:16:23,486
It's kind of sick and twisted.

347
00:16:23,488 --> 00:16:25,575
Childhood diary entries.

348
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:28,839
Rewritten with an adult
perspective and vernacular.

349
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:30,060
But seriously,

350
00:16:31,453 --> 00:16:34,020
you should try, you should come.

351
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:36,543
You're in luck.

352
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:39,633
I'm going to be reading a passage
about my first ever boner.

353
00:16:39,635 --> 00:16:41,591
So, there's that.

354
00:16:41,593 --> 00:16:43,288
Oh, that's amazing.

355
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,507
Hi, excuse me, slave.

356
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:46,727
- Oh, wow.
- Need ya.

357
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:49,120
Okay,
I'm being summoned.

358
00:16:49,122 --> 00:16:51,471
So off to work you must go.

359
00:16:51,473 --> 00:16:52,559
Hi ho.

360
00:16:52,561 --> 00:16:53,603
Hi ho.

361
00:16:53,605 --> 00:16:54,430
The dwarves.

362
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:55,605
Yeah.

363
00:16:55,607 --> 00:16:58,393
Hey,
thanks for the invite.

364
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,308
Ugh, fuck.

365
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,484
What's your problem?

366
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:06,964
I have my meeting
with Charles.

367
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:08,270
Yeah?

368
00:17:08,272 --> 00:17:09,837
I think I'm just
going to cancel it.

369
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,577
Dude, you've been blowing
that guy off for two months.

370
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:11,752
When's your meeting?

371
00:17:11,754 --> 00:17:13,580
It's in 15 minutes.

372
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:14,798
I'm not even dressed,
I feel like shit...

373
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,844
Okay so your meeting
is in 15 minutes?

374
00:17:16,846 --> 00:17:18,106
Yeah, you're going.

375
00:17:18,108 --> 00:17:20,500
- No, you're going.
- No.

376
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:21,718
I'm very
glad that I'm here

377
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,241
because I'm a positive
influence on you...

378
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:26,506
Oh yeah, a very
good influence.

379
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:41,608
You look like hell.

380
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,090
Well that's funny, because
I feel like an angel.

381
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:47,483
How have you been?

382
00:17:47,485 --> 00:17:49,616
Oh, well, I've been great.

383
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:52,880
My boyfriend took me
out for a nice meal,

384
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:54,969
humiliated me in front
of all of his friends

385
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:56,755
and then he dumped me.

386
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:02,805
Well, you'll have plenty of
time to make these changes.

387
00:18:03,632 --> 00:18:06,546
It's not about time, Charles.

388
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:10,637
I just, I don't have
the backbone anymore.

389
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:13,117
Well there are lot of other
writers out there who do.

390
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,815
They're hungry for this.

391
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:18,383
But I'm here because I
see something in you.

392
00:18:18,385 --> 00:18:20,516
What do you see in me?

393
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:23,084
I see someone who if she
would just challenge herself,

394
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:25,695
and push past the point
of feeling uncomfortable,

395
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:27,482
could do great things.

396
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,659
And in doing so make
me a lot of money.

397
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,617
But right now all I see
is someone who wants to

398
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:37,796
throw in the towel
when times get tough.

399
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:41,581
This is a gift, Rachel.

400
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,193
Don't throw it away.

401
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:55,116
Dude, look at you.

402
00:18:55,118 --> 00:18:56,552
You are prime for
rebound sex right now.

403
00:18:56,554 --> 00:18:58,336
I'm not, I'm not
even there yet.

404
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,600
Rach, what is the point
of us going if you're not

405
00:19:00,602 --> 00:19:02,123
going to flirt with the
cute front desk guy?

406
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,386
Well first of all,
his name is Trevor.

407
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:05,692
Whatever.

408
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:06,736
And I'm not going to
flirt with him, okay?

409
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:08,869
Okay, I'll see you later, bye.

410
00:19:08,871 --> 00:19:11,741
I don't even
know how, anymore.

411
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,613
Look, you go up
to him afterward,

412
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:15,223
be friendly, smile.

413
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:16,790
Tell him you liked it,
whether you did or not,

414
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:17,921
offer to buy him a beer.

415
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,575
Well, what if he says yes?

416
00:19:19,577 --> 00:19:20,707
Good.

417
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:21,621
What are you going to do?

418
00:19:21,623 --> 00:19:22,970
You'll be the third wheel.

419
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:23,884
No I won't.

420
00:19:23,886 --> 00:19:24,798
Ernest is meeting us there.

421
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,931
Oh, Ernest.

422
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:27,627
Who is that?

423
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:28,889
Your flavor of the month?

424
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:32,372
Yep, tastes like
money and Aqua Di Gio.

425
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,593
Red pricklies, up my legs,

426
00:19:36,725 --> 00:19:40,248
starting from my
toes and down my back

427
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,511
starting from my brain.

428
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:44,602
Coursed through my frame.

429
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:48,301
All leading to one place.

430
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:52,654
The center of my being.

431
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:56,048
My penis was alive.

432
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:58,877
Vigor was its name.

433
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:02,838
What used to be a spongy flesh

434
00:20:04,274 --> 00:20:06,666
and a collection of filth

435
00:20:06,668 --> 00:20:08,060
was now a beacon

436
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:12,628
like the lighthouse
at Long Beach Island,

437
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,719
it stood on end, shining.

438
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:19,028
Was there a bone down there?

439
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:23,813
Stop,
this is special.

440
00:20:23,815 --> 00:20:26,296
Would it be this way forever?

441
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:30,082
My pants were
slightly disfigured,

442
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:34,739
as if an elf was reaching
through my jammies

443
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:37,046
for Jesus' help.

444
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:39,788
Jesus isn't real.

445
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:47,663
The work itself
was just so profound.

446
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:50,710
He took an experience
we could all relate to,

447
00:20:50,712 --> 00:20:54,061
males of course, and expressed
it in a way that maintained

448
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:57,760
the naivety of youth while
incorporating the complexities

449
00:20:57,762 --> 00:20:59,022
of adult thought processes.

450
00:20:59,024 --> 00:20:59,762
Hey.

451
00:20:59,764 --> 00:21:00,720
Hey.

452
00:21:00,722 --> 00:21:01,721
Oh my God, you were so great.

453
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:02,765
Thanks.

454
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:03,984
You
were really funny.

455
00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:04,724
Cool,
I'm glad you came.

456
00:21:04,726 --> 00:21:06,073
Thanks for coming.

457
00:21:06,075 --> 00:21:06,682
Hi, I'd like to
introduce myself.

458
00:21:06,684 --> 00:21:07,509
I'm Ernest.

459
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:08,033
Oh, are you?

460
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:09,905
Oh, he is.

461
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:12,690
I am.

462
00:21:15,737 --> 00:21:17,432
Why don't we all get a drink.

463
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:18,738
Yeah, yeah, I was going
to suggest that actually.

464
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,739
I know the perfect place.

465
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:20,870
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

466
00:21:20,872 --> 00:21:22,439
Grand.

467
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,705
I mean that vulnerability,
that most people don't

468
00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:33,578
even delve into, and to
take that and to share it

469
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,319
amongst a group of strangers.

470
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,672
I mean it's, it's provocative.

471
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,628
Very provocative.

472
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,411
Whoa.

473
00:21:40,413 --> 00:21:41,761
Thanks, man.

474
00:21:41,763 --> 00:21:42,979
Provocativeness
in its boldest form.

475
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:44,459
But I mean not just
for the viewer,

476
00:21:44,461 --> 00:21:45,982
but for your own personal being.

477
00:21:45,984 --> 00:21:47,331
Nicole, can you please stop?

478
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:50,030
I'm trying to have
a conversation.

479
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:52,946
Hands where I can
see them, right guys?

480
00:21:52,948 --> 00:21:56,906
Hey, Trevor, did you know
that Rachel is a writer?

481
00:21:56,908 --> 00:21:57,820
Oh, really?

482
00:21:57,822 --> 00:21:58,778
No.

483
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,909
No, I did not know that.

484
00:21:59,911 --> 00:22:01,345
I'm not really a writer.

485
00:22:01,347 --> 00:22:02,869
I don't know.

486
00:22:02,871 --> 00:22:04,958
I haven't really put pen to
paper in a very long time.

487
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,221
Do you just have
nothing to write about?

488
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:10,093
There's always
something to write about.

489
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,616
You know what it is?

490
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:13,662
I think it has to do with fear.

491
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:14,445
You know?

492
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:15,969
Yeah.

493
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:17,144
Like we as artists, we're
afraid that what we create

494
00:22:17,146 --> 00:22:19,799
is not going to be good enough.

495
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:21,931
Or, you know, perfect.

496
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:26,457
The worst enemy to
creativity is self-doubt.

497
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:27,458
Sylvia Plath.

498
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,679
You studied.

499
00:22:29,854 --> 00:22:32,376
And see, look at how
well she turned out.

500
00:22:32,378 --> 00:22:34,772
Didn't she commit suicide?

501
00:22:37,253 --> 00:22:38,469
She did.

502
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:39,472
Yeah, man.

503
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:44,954
You know, it's hard
to find inspiration.

504
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:45,868
I'm sorry.

505
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,826
I can't hear you.

506
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:48,653
What was that?

507
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:52,092
I was saying it's
hard to find inspiration

508
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:54,094
when your head is in an oven.

509
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,446
Ernest, I'm kidding.

510
00:22:58,448 --> 00:22:59,229
Sorry.

511
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:00,578
Okay.

512
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,884
I'm sorry, I'm just
trying to make a joke.

513
00:23:01,886 --> 00:23:02,885
Okay.

514
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:03,799
Don't, don't try.

515
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:06,454
No, but I am serious.

516
00:23:06,456 --> 00:23:09,413
I do think it is hard
to find inspiration.

517
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:11,546
Well if you sit around
and wait for inspiration,

518
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:13,200
it might never come, you know.

519
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:14,984
But that's why I
try to force myself

520
00:23:14,986 --> 00:23:16,812
to write every single day.

521
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:18,596
Let the juices flow.

522
00:23:18,598 --> 00:23:20,424
Sometimes I'll sit
there for hours.

523
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:23,993
And other times, phew,
stroke of genius.

524
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:26,343
Hey, better than
a regular stroke.

525
00:23:26,345 --> 00:23:28,955
I mean, I don't understand
that from an artistic concept,

526
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:31,566
but from a business
standpoint absolutely.

527
00:23:31,568 --> 00:23:32,961
Yeah.

528
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:36,179
Oh, wow.

529
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,923
I mean I don't want to impose
my beliefs on anyone else,

530
00:23:40,925 --> 00:23:43,970
but it's just, my uncle
died of lung cancer

531
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:45,972
and he didn't even
smoke in his life.

532
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:48,888
But his second wife
Marjorie smoked these big...

533
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,889
Ernest?

534
00:23:49,891 --> 00:23:51,762
Shut the fuck up, okay?

535
00:23:52,719 --> 00:23:53,503
Okay.

536
00:23:56,898 --> 00:23:59,899
So tonight was
oddly entertaining.

537
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:01,988
I thought it was fun.

538
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,078
It was fun.

539
00:24:04,557 --> 00:24:06,688
Hey, I was serious
about what I said before.

540
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:11,475
If you want to be a writer, I
think you should be a writer.

541
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:13,086
Write.

542
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:16,916
The inspiration will come once
you get out of your own way.

543
00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:18,004
Sorry.

544
00:24:18,006 --> 00:24:19,483
I'm like lecturing you.

545
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:20,920
I'm being a total jerk.

546
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:22,878
You're not a total jerk.

547
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,576
I mean, God, with the
amount of time I've spent

548
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:27,709
feeling sorry for myself lately,

549
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:31,626
I could have written like
three self-help books.

550
00:24:31,628 --> 00:24:34,022
And like nine erotic novels.

551
00:24:35,371 --> 00:24:37,066
You're not a total jerk.

552
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:39,503
I mean a quasi-jerk, maybe.

553
00:24:39,505 --> 00:24:40,809
That's kind of a given.

554
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:42,202
A quasi-jerk.

555
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:46,077
Here I am thinking I just
ruined our first date.

556
00:24:59,221 --> 00:25:00,220
I'll rip your stockings.

557
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:01,527
I don't care.

558
00:25:06,097 --> 00:25:07,705
Yeah right there.

559
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:09,011
Right there, right there.

560
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:10,360
The Holy Spirit.

561
00:25:10,362 --> 00:25:12,364
Mother, father, creator.

562
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:15,278
With being the
truth on the street.

563
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,455
See, she's got the right idea.

564
00:25:18,457 --> 00:25:20,196
Praise Jesus.

565
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:22,807
No, but look at her though.

566
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:25,114
Isn't she beautiful?

567
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:26,724
Just loving her life.

568
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:29,989
Not giving a fuck about anything
but the Big Guy upstairs.

569
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:37,085
You think I could
ever be free like that?

570
00:25:38,521 --> 00:25:39,737
Probably not.

571
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:42,090
Yeah, you're probably right.

572
00:25:45,006 --> 00:25:47,006
Well, I think I better go.

573
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:50,052
'Cause I've got to make sure
that Ernest is still alive.

574
00:25:50,054 --> 00:25:51,184
She is a man-eater

575
00:25:51,186 --> 00:25:53,316
That's very true.

576
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:54,100
Good night, Trevor.

577
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:55,146
Hey.

578
00:25:56,017 --> 00:25:57,059
Keep your head out of the oven.

579
00:25:57,061 --> 00:25:59,107
Okay, well I'll try.

580
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,063
Bye.

581
00:26:01,065 --> 00:26:01,892
Bye.

582
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:08,681
Keep your head out of the oven.

583
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,424
Keep your head out of the oven.

584
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:27,350
Oh hey!

585
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,134
Oh, don't mind me...

586
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:29,048
No, no, no, no!

587
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,092
Hey hey, we're done, we're done.

588
00:26:30,094 --> 00:26:30,921
You go.

589
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:37,319
So I'll call you tomorrow.

590
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,320
When?

591
00:26:40,322 --> 00:26:41,886
Tomorrow.

592
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:42,975
Looking forward to your call.

593
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:43,760
Okay.

594
00:26:45,718 --> 00:26:47,022
I had a lovely evening...

595
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,851
So, you're
going to call him tomorrow?

596
00:26:49,853 --> 00:26:51,984
I am
literally never going

597
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:53,988
to see that human again.

598
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:57,815
He's somehow more
boring than you are.

599
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:58,601
Boring?!

600
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:05,823
Let me tell you, I macramed
a potholder last week, okay?

601
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,219
On two cups of decaf coffee.

602
00:27:09,264 --> 00:27:11,090
Let's talk about boring.

603
00:27:11,092 --> 00:27:14,093
Do you remember when
you use to be fun, Rach?

604
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:16,225
We used to stay out
every single night

605
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:19,837
till six a.m., shit house drunk,

606
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:22,144
dancing out little tushies off,

607
00:27:22,146 --> 00:27:25,930
talking the L train of
shame home every morning.

608
00:27:25,932 --> 00:27:28,150
Oh yeah, and
getting pussy scooped

609
00:27:28,152 --> 00:27:31,588
by the heinous bouncer
at the Lit Lounge.

610
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,288
Or how about when I was
holding your hair back

611
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:40,295
while you were puking up
bile in Marcus Garvey Park?

612
00:27:41,122 --> 00:27:43,167
The dictionary definition, fun.

613
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,126
God, those were the days.

614
00:27:47,128 --> 00:27:49,130
September 27th 2012.

615
00:27:50,479 --> 00:27:53,871
Cutting The Cord, A
poem by Rachel Nolan.

616
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:55,134
Nicole, don't.

617
00:27:55,136 --> 00:27:57,092
"When your mother's
cervical cave

618
00:27:57,094 --> 00:27:58,528
"yawned upon your arrival

619
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,141
"and met the sun halfway
betwixt hither and dither,

620
00:28:02,143 --> 00:28:03,272
"love was made."

621
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:04,186
Nicole, stop it.

622
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:05,144
"Honeyed, and candid"...

623
00:28:05,146 --> 00:28:06,145
Stop!

624
00:28:06,147 --> 00:28:07,189
What?!

625
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:08,277
This isn't funny.

626
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,974
Are you embarrassed?

627
00:28:09,976 --> 00:28:12,151
This is who you are, okay?

628
00:28:12,153 --> 00:28:14,327
Look at us, we are youngish,

629
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:15,850
better than average looking,

630
00:28:15,852 --> 00:28:18,200
weirdo artsy types
living in the best

631
00:28:18,202 --> 00:28:20,159
god-damned city in
the world, okay?

632
00:28:20,161 --> 00:28:21,551
I'd say we have it
pretty fucking good.

633
00:28:21,553 --> 00:28:24,163
And you, you have a book deal.

634
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:26,208
I don't have a book deal.

635
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,645
Okay, I have a shitty
manuscript that continuously

636
00:28:28,647 --> 00:28:31,257
gets ripped to shreds and
it will never be good enough

637
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:33,259
to publish and I'm
fucking over it.

638
00:28:33,261 --> 00:28:34,305
Okay?

639
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:38,133
Oh, Negative Nancy, I
didn't see you arrive.

640
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:40,266
Okay, I'm Negative Nancy now.

641
00:28:40,268 --> 00:28:44,835
I don't know, Rach, but
I don't know who this is.

642
00:28:44,837 --> 00:28:47,229
Richard turned you
into this conservative

643
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:51,277
little cardigan wearing
house trained Stepford Wife.

644
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,192
This is not you.

645
00:28:53,194 --> 00:28:55,455
Okay, well since you
obviously know me better

646
00:28:55,457 --> 00:28:59,154
than I know myself, if
'Rachel' was here right now

647
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:00,416
what would she be doing?

648
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:01,722
She wouldn't be here.

649
00:29:01,724 --> 00:29:03,158
She would be with
Trevor having a hot

650
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,246
and heavy make-out sesh.

651
00:29:04,248 --> 00:29:05,552
Depending on his worthiness,

652
00:29:05,554 --> 00:29:07,293
probably feeling his
boner a little bit

653
00:29:07,295 --> 00:29:10,034
but keeping it classy and not
fucking on the first date.

654
00:29:10,036 --> 00:29:11,297
Okay, is that
what she would do?

655
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:12,341
Yeah.

656
00:29:12,343 --> 00:29:13,127
She would.

657
00:29:14,432 --> 00:29:18,349
Well I don't know who
you think I am or was

658
00:29:19,307 --> 00:29:23,267
or should be, but I'm
not that person anymore.

659
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:28,140
Yeah, well, maybe
you should be.

660
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:30,274
Because that person was fun.

661
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:33,451
A lot happier than you are.

662
00:29:40,328 --> 00:29:43,546
Richard
Goux made sense.

663
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,419
He was not what I wanted.

664
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:48,205
Deep down I knew that.

665
00:29:49,902 --> 00:29:53,295
But my life so far
had been a series

666
00:29:53,297 --> 00:29:57,345
of unfulfilled dreams
and unfulfilled desires.

667
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,262
So I tried not to dream.

668
00:30:03,002 --> 00:30:04,178
Not to desire.

669
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,181
Not to feel.

670
00:30:08,704 --> 00:30:12,708
An empty vessel I gave
myself to him completely.

671
00:30:14,971 --> 00:30:18,407
Blended into him
with the hope he'd

672
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:21,280
mold me into
something worthwhile.

673
00:30:21,282 --> 00:30:22,237
Hey, girl.

674
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:23,325
Jesus.

675
00:30:23,327 --> 00:30:24,805
Jessica.

676
00:30:24,807 --> 00:30:27,677
You look like you've been
dragged through the mud.

677
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,549
Do you want to go to lunch?

678
00:30:29,551 --> 00:30:31,290
You know, not today.

679
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:33,683
I'm sorry, I'm kind of...

680
00:30:33,685 --> 00:30:36,382
You always say that.

681
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:38,297
Look, Jessica, Richard
and I just broke up.

682
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:39,907
I'm not really in the mood...

683
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:40,864
I know.

684
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:42,388
I saw it on the internet.

685
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,954
You what?

686
00:30:43,956 --> 00:30:44,694
I was wondering
when you were going to tell me.

687
00:30:44,696 --> 00:30:46,870
You don't have to...

688
00:30:46,872 --> 00:30:47,915
I am here for you.

689
00:30:47,917 --> 00:30:49,308
Okay?

690
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,440
Okay, you just let me
know if you need anything.

691
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:52,311
Wow, thank you.

692
00:30:52,313 --> 00:30:53,529
You have value.

693
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:54,271
Okay.

694
00:31:27,348 --> 00:31:28,436
I hate you.

695
00:31:30,612 --> 00:31:32,481
You love me.

696
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:34,353
So I have to slave
away at my dead end job

697
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:37,356
while you get to sleep all day?

698
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:38,705
I was working.

699
00:31:38,707 --> 00:31:39,490
Uh huh.

700
00:31:40,361 --> 00:31:41,362
I'm so sure.

701
00:31:43,407 --> 00:31:48,369
I have just developed the
final piece for my show.

702
00:31:49,195 --> 00:31:49,892
A self-portrait.

703
00:31:57,378 --> 00:31:58,161
Wow.

704
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:03,207
It's part of a much larger

705
00:32:03,209 --> 00:32:05,471
installation of
course, entitled,

706
00:32:05,473 --> 00:32:06,733
are you ready?

707
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:08,389
Photos of My Nipples.

708
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:14,654
I've always said that nipples
are the eyes to the heart.

709
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:16,395
You've never said that.

710
00:32:16,397 --> 00:32:18,484
Well, I'm saying it now.

711
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:20,703
So I try to get a nip pic
of every new person I meet.

712
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:21,574
Black nipples.

713
00:32:21,576 --> 00:32:22,749
White nipples.

714
00:32:22,751 --> 00:32:24,838
Puerto Rican nipples.

715
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,056
Pierced nipples.

716
00:32:26,058 --> 00:32:27,449
Pretty nipples.

717
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:28,407
Engorged nipples...

718
00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:31,888
Okay, that's a lot of nipples.

719
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,934
Let me take a photo
of your nipples.

720
00:32:33,936 --> 00:32:35,152
Oh, hell no.

721
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:35,936
Okay, just one.

722
00:32:35,938 --> 00:32:37,590
Just the wonky one.

723
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:40,549
Richard always
liked my wonky nipple.

724
00:32:40,551 --> 00:32:44,466
He said it was like bringing
another woman into the bedroom.

725
00:32:44,468 --> 00:32:45,728
That's weird.

726
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:46,514
Yeah.

727
00:32:47,428 --> 00:32:48,427
Anyway.

728
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:49,645
Show me the one-eyed bandit.

729
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:50,429
No, what are you doing?

730
00:32:50,431 --> 00:32:51,473
Get off of me.

731
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:52,300
I'm going to get you.

732
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:53,606
No, stop!

733
00:32:53,608 --> 00:32:57,349
I'm going to get you.

734
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,439
Kill yourself.

735
00:33:00,571 --> 00:33:01,440
That's mine.

736
00:33:01,442 --> 00:33:03,182
I don't think so.

737
00:33:17,022 --> 00:33:18,415
How do I look?

738
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:20,330
Hold on.

739
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:25,379
Dude, I am so happy for you.

740
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:27,248
Shut up.

741
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,251
Seriously.

742
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:32,514
I remember my first Quinceanera.

743
00:33:32,516 --> 00:33:34,734
Oh, because I
look like a pinata.

744
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:37,737
And because you're
full of sweet things.

745
00:33:37,739 --> 00:33:39,478
Shall we go inside?

746
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,610
Yes, we shall.

747
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:52,578
What?

748
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,883
Why do you think she should
cover herself better?

749
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:55,145
Because I can see from
my eyes, I can see her...

750
00:33:55,147 --> 00:33:56,320
That's exactly why
she needs to be naked.

751
00:33:56,322 --> 00:33:57,887
Because you have a
vulture ass opinion...

752
00:33:57,889 --> 00:33:59,628
Well she can at least,
you know, show me her tits.

753
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:00,542
They're just kind
of like hiding.

754
00:34:00,544 --> 00:34:03,153
That's like.

755
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:04,198
Hey.

756
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,329
Hey!

757
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:06,592
Where's your bounce board?

758
00:34:06,594 --> 00:34:10,509
Oh, my God, I can't
believe I left it.

759
00:34:10,511 --> 00:34:12,075
Is there a lost-and-found
around here?

760
00:34:12,077 --> 00:34:14,295
You know it should never
leave your side to begin with.

761
00:34:14,297 --> 00:34:15,557
God, you're so right.

762
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:16,558
I need one of those
little pocket ones

763
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,472
so I can whip it
out and be like,

764
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:19,518
oh, find your light!

765
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,301
You know?

766
00:34:20,303 --> 00:34:21,084
Hey.

767
00:34:21,086 --> 00:34:21,998
Hello.

768
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,651
Can you hold this?

769
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:23,478
I've got to pee.

770
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,610
Sure.

771
00:34:24,612 --> 00:34:25,306
Hey Nicole, how ya doing?

772
00:34:25,308 --> 00:34:26,440
Hi, Trevor.

773
00:34:28,703 --> 00:34:30,572
Okay, maturity.

774
00:34:30,574 --> 00:34:32,052
Let me know if you
see Cameron, okay?

775
00:34:32,054 --> 00:34:33,447
Sure.

776
00:34:35,187 --> 00:34:37,753
So, I got you something.

777
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:38,667
You did?

778
00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:39,494
Oh my God...

779
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,104
It's no big deal.

780
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:43,411
It's just, I saw it and
I had thought of you, so.

781
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:44,196
Ah.

782
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:47,589
This is so great.

783
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:48,808
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

784
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:51,288
You just write your
thoughts in it, or not.

785
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,594
Haikus.

786
00:34:52,596 --> 00:34:54,944
Or you know, my
first ever boner.

787
00:34:54,946 --> 00:34:56,119
I can write about that.

788
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:58,644
Endless possibilities

789
00:34:58,646 --> 00:34:59,688
in that.

790
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,516
This was really sweet.

791
00:35:24,715 --> 00:35:25,758
Hey.

792
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,976
You will never
guess who is here.

793
00:35:26,978 --> 00:35:27,890
Who?

794
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,805
Steven Anthony Lawrence.

795
00:35:29,807 --> 00:35:30,589
I know.

796
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:31,807
I invited him.

797
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:33,722
He really likes photography.

798
00:35:33,724 --> 00:35:36,682
Yeah and your
nipples, as I recall.

799
00:35:36,684 --> 00:35:40,120
Look, Steven Anthony Lawrence
is the Willy Wonka of drugs.

800
00:35:40,122 --> 00:35:41,469
Okay?

801
00:35:41,471 --> 00:35:42,601
His apartment, the
Chocolate Factory.

802
00:35:42,603 --> 00:35:44,167
Anything could happen.

803
00:35:44,169 --> 00:35:47,649
If my top just magically
happened to fall off,

804
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:49,608
I can't be held
accountable for that.

805
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,739
Ladies.

806
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:52,262
Steven!

807
00:35:52,264 --> 00:35:53,527
Come to papa.

808
00:35:54,658 --> 00:35:56,658
Wow, did you
skin this yourself?

809
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,617
You must have
been working out.

810
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,532
Oh you ladies are so funny.

811
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:04,100
Nicole, your pictures
are so beautiful.

812
00:36:04,102 --> 00:36:06,320
Thank you, Steven.

813
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:10,454
I've always said, "Nipples
are the eyes to the heart."

814
00:36:10,456 --> 00:36:12,282
Okay, that is not at thing.

815
00:36:12,284 --> 00:36:14,546
Especially the self-portrait.

816
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:17,505
They are as divine
as I remember them.

817
00:36:17,507 --> 00:36:20,595
Steven, you're
making them blush.

818
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:23,818
Ladies, I wanted to
give you something.

819
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:26,777
Pure M D M A.

820
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:32,389
Steven, are you
trying to seduce me?

821
00:36:32,391 --> 00:36:34,653
Because it's working.

822
00:36:34,655 --> 00:36:36,439
Have fun, ladies.

823
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:39,788
Claudia?

824
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:42,314
Bring that ass back here, girl!

825
00:36:44,752 --> 00:36:47,230
Remember that musical
with the song about beans?

826
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,712
Or was it greens?

827
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:53,323
Did you just take that?

828
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:54,629
Mmm hmm, your turn.

829
00:36:54,631 --> 00:36:56,196
I'm not taking it.

830
00:36:56,198 --> 00:36:57,806
You're going to let me go
down the rabbit hole by myself?!

831
00:36:57,808 --> 00:36:59,678
No, you didn't even
think about this,

832
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,244
we didn't talk about it...

833
00:37:01,246 --> 00:37:02,681
Steven Anthony Lawrence
is a trusted source.

834
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:03,725
You know this.

835
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:04,683
No, it's not him.

836
00:37:04,685 --> 00:37:06,772
It's just I don't,

837
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:08,948
I don't, I'm scared.

838
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,558
It scares me.

839
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,560
Rach, there's a reason
they call it Ecstasy, okay?

840
00:37:12,562 --> 00:37:14,910
Plus you've done it
like a thousand times.

841
00:37:14,912 --> 00:37:16,782
I've done it four
and a half times.

842
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:19,132
Half because that one time we
went to that warehouse party

843
00:37:19,134 --> 00:37:20,394
that definitely wasn't Ecstasy...

844
00:37:20,396 --> 00:37:22,485
Take the the damn pill.

845
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:39,894
The nipple

846
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:41,809
is a very

847
00:37:43,201 --> 00:37:45,334
intimate part of the body

848
00:37:46,988 --> 00:37:50,208
we don't often have
a chance to share.

849
00:37:52,254 --> 00:37:55,298
My project affords
my subjects the

850
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,955
opportunity to
express themselves

851
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,609
and their nipples with freedom.

852
00:38:05,354 --> 00:38:07,661
I'm changing lives, people!

853
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:16,713
Excuse me.

854
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:19,888
Ah!

855
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,761
Steven, I will
never forget the time

856
00:38:22,763 --> 00:38:24,240
when you went and got burritos

857
00:38:24,242 --> 00:38:25,851
and I let my wallet at home.

858
00:38:25,853 --> 00:38:27,809
And you bought me that burrito.

859
00:38:27,811 --> 00:38:29,811
I don't think I've
ever paid you back.

860
00:38:29,813 --> 00:38:30,986
It's cool, yo.

861
00:38:30,988 --> 00:38:32,335
Are you sure?

862
00:38:32,337 --> 00:38:34,468
Hi, can I borrow
her for a minute?

863
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,251
Yeah.

864
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:36,035
Thanks.

865
00:38:36,037 --> 00:38:37,166
I love you.

866
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:43,782
Hi, how big are
my pupils right now?

867
00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:45,261
Pretty fucking big.

868
00:38:45,263 --> 00:38:46,264
Let's dance.

869
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:15,814
Hey.

870
00:39:15,816 --> 00:39:18,512
Do you want to go pee?

871
00:39:18,514 --> 00:39:20,168
Yeah, let's go pee.

872
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,610
Hello, I'm rolling
balls right now.

873
00:39:28,872 --> 00:39:32,221
Oh, God, it's hard
to pee on drugs.

874
00:39:32,223 --> 00:39:36,182
Well why don't you
quit trying so hard?

875
00:39:38,055 --> 00:39:39,838
You hear that?

876
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:43,319
That's the sound of the
stream of consciousness.

877
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:44,758
You are a genius.

878
00:39:46,194 --> 00:39:47,195
Thank you.

879
00:39:49,371 --> 00:39:53,025
I saw you give your
girlfriend googly eyes.

880
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:54,983
Why are you so upset?

881
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:57,333
Because it's fascinating.

882
00:39:57,335 --> 00:39:59,161
Well if you're so
fascinated by it,

883
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,468
why don't you just do it?

884
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,861
Why her?

885
00:40:02,863 --> 00:40:04,036
I don't know.

886
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:06,821
She's been eating
pussy since 1982.

887
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:11,001
No, I mean why her and not me?

888
00:40:16,398 --> 00:40:19,401
Is it because I'm
not pretty enough?

889
00:40:22,143 --> 00:40:27,015
No, you're obviously
just way too classy for me.

890
00:40:27,017 --> 00:40:28,669
I'm serious.

891
00:40:28,671 --> 00:40:29,454
Really?

892
00:40:31,674 --> 00:40:33,241
Um, well, okay, one,

893
00:40:34,895 --> 00:40:36,590
you're my best friend.

894
00:40:36,592 --> 00:40:37,634
Sure

895
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:40,030
Two, you don't
even like girls.

896
00:40:41,466 --> 00:40:42,206
And three,

897
00:40:46,428 --> 00:40:47,906
you get weird.

898
00:40:47,908 --> 00:40:49,908
I do not get weird.

899
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,910
How do I get weird?

900
00:40:51,912 --> 00:40:53,085
You're really,
you're going to make me

901
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:54,913
spell this out
for you right now?

902
00:40:54,915 --> 00:40:58,309
Okay, well with every
guy you've ever dated

903
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:04,661
and every guy you've had
sex with for that matter

904
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:07,231
you get really clingy and weird.

905
00:41:10,582 --> 00:41:12,626
I do get weird.

906
00:41:12,628 --> 00:41:16,891
Sometimes everything just
feels so out-of-control.

907
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:18,197
I just can't...

908
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:20,634
Rach, you are completely
missing the point.

909
00:41:20,636 --> 00:41:21,548
Okay, this is you.

910
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,810
Are you ready?

911
00:41:22,812 --> 00:41:23,550
You're looking at your
watch, you're like

912
00:41:23,552 --> 00:41:24,464
"Hmmm, what time is it?"

913
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:27,423
The time is always a clock.

914
00:41:27,425 --> 00:41:32,254
Okay, the only time you have
any semblance of control

915
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,476
is in this current moment.

916
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:37,520
This is the only moment
that we're ever in.

917
00:41:37,522 --> 00:41:41,176
This is the only moment
that ever exists.

918
00:41:41,178 --> 00:41:42,438
This moment right now?

919
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,964
Yeah, the now one.

920
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:50,274
What are you doing?

921
00:42:23,655 --> 00:42:24,526
Let's go.

922
00:42:27,746 --> 00:42:28,528
Jesus.

923
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:29,921
Not a Bentley right?

924
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:32,010
What the fuck, a Bentley?

925
00:42:32,012 --> 00:42:33,489
Yeah, that's wack.

926
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:35,102
Yeah, thank you.

927
00:42:51,118 --> 00:42:54,206
Come
home to bed away to.

928
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,078
I'm done.

929
00:42:57,559 --> 00:42:59,037
Look at the way
these lights just

930
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:00,299
intertwine with one another.

931
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:02,866
It's like they're all a family.

932
00:43:02,868 --> 00:43:03,867
Well you know what they say,

933
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:06,174
"Home is where the heart is."

934
00:43:06,176 --> 00:43:07,349
That's what they
say in Scotland.

935
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,003
It sounded better in my head.

936
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:10,093
I'm sure.

937
00:43:11,616 --> 00:43:15,488
Second star to the right and
straight on until morning.

938
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,142
I'm king of the world!

939
00:43:17,144 --> 00:43:18,491
God, wait, what
movie are you doing?

940
00:43:18,493 --> 00:43:19,840
Titanic, what are you doing?

941
00:43:19,842 --> 00:43:20,710
Peter Pan.

942
00:43:20,712 --> 00:43:22,886
Oh, that's right.

943
00:43:22,888 --> 00:43:23,672
I can fly!

944
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,938
Oh, so good right now.

945
00:43:52,222 --> 00:43:53,484
What do you want?

946
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:07,602
Is this okay?

947
00:46:50,313 --> 00:46:51,227
I love you.

948
00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:56,754
I love you, too.

949
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:27,305
Rach.

950
00:47:27,307 --> 00:47:30,223
You're going to
be late for work.

951
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:43,468
It's beautiful.

952
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,773
Oh, I'm so excited.

953
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:46,601
- I'm sure I am.
- I'm so excited.

954
00:48:46,603 --> 00:48:48,473
Well,.

955
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:16,675
Excuse me, miss.

956
00:49:16,677 --> 00:49:18,241
Miss?

957
00:49:18,243 --> 00:49:19,810
Is a paper bag okay?

958
00:50:09,817 --> 00:50:10,644
Wow.

959
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:15,342
It smells like a dream in here.

960
00:50:15,344 --> 00:50:17,346
You did all this for me?

961
00:50:22,003 --> 00:50:23,524
I love you.

962
00:50:36,757 --> 00:50:40,585
You will never guess
who I saw today?

963
00:50:40,587 --> 00:50:41,716
Go ahead, guess.

964
00:50:41,718 --> 00:50:44,719
Never mind, you'll never get it.

965
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:46,068
What?

966
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:49,768
Professor Petrini, my
old Italian professor.

967
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,814
Oh really, what happened?

968
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,512
Okay, so I see
him on the train.

969
00:50:54,514 --> 00:50:56,122
I go up to him, I'm like.

970
00:50:56,124 --> 00:50:57,515
He totally remembered me.

971
00:50:57,517 --> 00:50:59,430
He told me I was one of
his favorite students.

972
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:00,735
And I'm feeling kind
of bold and I was like

973
00:51:00,737 --> 00:51:01,910
"I had the biggest
crush on you".

974
00:51:01,912 --> 00:51:03,521
And he's like "I know".

975
00:51:03,523 --> 00:51:04,696
He fucking knew, can
you believe that?

976
00:51:04,698 --> 00:51:06,219
And then he says to
me "If you're good

977
00:51:06,221 --> 00:51:08,177
"I will show you my nipples.

978
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:10,528
"If you're great I
will take you to Italy

979
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:12,575
"and show you my Naples."

980
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:14,575
Right.

981
00:51:14,577 --> 00:51:15,663
Hello?

982
00:51:15,665 --> 00:51:16,838
Are you alright?

983
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,451
Yeah, no, sorry.

984
00:51:19,669 --> 00:51:20,538
That's really funny.

985
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,539
Yeah.

986
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:23,192
Kizmet.

987
00:51:23,194 --> 00:51:24,498
He's so hot.

988
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:26,413
Nicole, he's
like 100 years old.

989
00:51:26,415 --> 00:51:28,328
I know, he's like old-man hot.

990
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:30,417
That's the best kind.

991
00:51:30,419 --> 00:51:31,549
Is this for us?

992
00:51:31,551 --> 00:51:33,551
Yeah, I made brisket.

993
00:51:33,553 --> 00:51:34,682
Your favorite.

994
00:51:34,684 --> 00:51:35,990
Oh my goodness.

995
00:51:39,123 --> 00:51:39,905
Oh shit.

996
00:51:39,907 --> 00:51:40,690
Hot.

997
00:51:41,648 --> 00:51:42,777
Yeah.

998
00:51:42,779 --> 00:51:45,652
I just pulled it
out of the oven.

999
00:51:54,835 --> 00:51:58,793
One stroke of her finger
tips and my heart fell.

1000
00:51:58,795 --> 00:52:01,404
Leaden into the
pit of my stomach.

1001
00:52:01,406 --> 00:52:04,930
And the next stroke rose up
again to the back of my throat.

1002
00:52:04,932 --> 00:52:07,889
That exhilarating feeling
like the first drop

1003
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:12,198
on the Coney Island cyclone or
standing behind the curtain,

1004
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,723
poised, waiting to
enter the scene.

1005
00:52:15,725 --> 00:52:19,074
My whole life I've been
my biggest adversary,

1006
00:52:19,076 --> 00:52:22,382
standing in the way
of my own pleasure.

1007
00:52:22,384 --> 00:52:24,863
Now all I want is that feeling.

1008
00:52:24,865 --> 00:52:26,647
That touch.

1009
00:52:26,649 --> 00:52:27,824
Again and again.

1010
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:35,134
Hey there.

1011
00:52:35,136 --> 00:52:35,919
Hey.

1012
00:52:37,138 --> 00:52:38,659
What's up?

1013
00:52:38,661 --> 00:52:41,532
What are you up to tonight?

1014
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:42,837
I don't know.

1015
00:52:42,839 --> 00:52:46,537
I rented this bizarre
film called Dog Tooth.

1016
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:47,320
Wow, cool.

1017
00:52:47,322 --> 00:52:48,584
Let's watch it.

1018
00:52:50,281 --> 00:52:51,021
Cool.

1019
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,718
See ya later.

1020
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,547
Okay bye.

1021
00:53:28,668 --> 00:53:29,971
Hey.

1022
00:53:29,973 --> 00:53:32,628
Didn't get to say
bye last night.

1023
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:37,065
No worries.

1024
00:53:37,067 --> 00:53:39,287
So, bye and hi.

1025
00:53:41,637 --> 00:53:43,596
P. S. I've been writing.

1026
00:53:45,162 --> 00:53:46,422
Can't
wait to read it.

1027
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:49,079
That is, if I have
the privilege.

1028
00:53:50,254 --> 00:53:53,475
Of course, after
all you are one of my,

1029
00:53:56,565 --> 00:53:57,653
you are my muse.

1030
00:54:02,832 --> 00:54:03,701
Knock, knock, knock.

1031
00:54:03,703 --> 00:54:04,789
Hey, hey.

1032
00:54:04,791 --> 00:54:06,225
Hey, you're in a good mood.

1033
00:54:06,227 --> 00:54:08,662
Over Richard so quickly?

1034
00:54:08,664 --> 00:54:09,794
You're right.

1035
00:54:09,796 --> 00:54:10,882
It's none of my business.

1036
00:54:10,884 --> 00:54:12,144
I was just going
to say that like,

1037
00:54:12,146 --> 00:54:13,754
what's it been,
less than a week?

1038
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:15,713
You know, in spending
some time apart

1039
00:54:15,715 --> 00:54:17,976
I'm starting to realize
that Richard may not

1040
00:54:17,978 --> 00:54:20,456
be the right person for me.

1041
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:21,675
I'm really happy
for you, Rach.

1042
00:54:21,677 --> 00:54:24,373
Well,
thank you, Jessica.

1043
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:26,332
You know, don't let
a man bring you down.

1044
00:54:26,334 --> 00:54:28,726
You are absolutely right.

1045
00:54:28,728 --> 00:54:31,206
Hey, do you want to get lunch?

1046
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:32,730
Fab.

1047
00:54:32,732 --> 00:54:34,037
Let's go now.

1048
00:54:35,256 --> 00:54:36,344
I'm starving.

1049
00:54:37,867 --> 00:54:39,867
So yes, I mean there is
a part of me that wants

1050
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:41,782
to see her get over
Richard because, you know,

1051
00:54:41,784 --> 00:54:43,262
she's my best friend
and I don't want to

1052
00:54:43,264 --> 00:54:45,438
see her suffer and all that.

1053
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,702
But there's a slightly
larger part of me that just

1054
00:54:48,704 --> 00:54:50,008
doesn't want to hear
her whine about it.

1055
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:52,097
Yeah, she does love
to whine, doesn't she?

1056
00:54:52,099 --> 00:54:53,838
Yeah, but still.

1057
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,101
Well listen, if you
can help her, help her.

1058
00:54:56,103 --> 00:54:58,059
And don't worry,
I'm sure even Gandhi

1059
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,888
felt some self-satisfaction
in all of his altruism.

1060
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:01,715
You know what?

1061
00:55:01,717 --> 00:55:02,934
You're right.

1062
00:55:02,936 --> 00:55:06,154
And I am much like
Gandhi, only thinner.

1063
00:55:06,156 --> 00:55:08,376
And more humble.

1064
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:11,943
Cameron suggested
we get her laid.

1065
00:55:11,945 --> 00:55:13,509
You're talking to him?

1066
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:14,295
No.

1067
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:17,557
Well, it's not
a horrible idea.

1068
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:18,776
Just make sure you
get a guy to bone her.

1069
00:55:18,778 --> 00:55:20,560
Don't you do it.

1070
00:55:28,875 --> 00:55:31,789
You know, she and Trevor

1071
00:55:31,791 --> 00:55:33,616
were totally digging
on each other.

1072
00:55:33,618 --> 00:55:34,574
- I could just...
- She, no.

1073
00:55:34,576 --> 00:55:35,488
What?

1074
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:36,794
She is way too good for him.

1075
00:55:36,796 --> 00:55:38,099
- Oh, are you serious?
- Are you kidding me?

1076
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:38,883
You're such
a fucking dick, dude.

1077
00:55:38,885 --> 00:55:40,145
Come on.

1078
00:55:40,147 --> 00:55:41,450
Fine, hook it up.

1079
00:55:41,452 --> 00:55:43,801
He's always liked her
for some bizarre reason.

1080
00:55:43,803 --> 00:55:44,627
You know what?

1081
00:55:44,629 --> 00:55:45,718
Maybe I will.

1082
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:49,850
And sure, you should
do that right now because

1083
00:55:49,852 --> 00:55:53,245
obviously I don't
need any help here.

1084
00:55:53,247 --> 00:55:54,768
T-Bone.

1085
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:55,726
Yo, yo, yo.

1086
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:57,379
So, are you working hard?

1087
00:55:57,381 --> 00:55:59,862
On my friend Rachel I assume?

1088
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,907
Not really work, per se.

1089
00:56:02,909 --> 00:56:04,778
Let me tell you something.

1090
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,477
She totally digs you.

1091
00:56:08,828 --> 00:56:09,957
Yeah?

1092
00:56:09,959 --> 00:56:11,132
Yeah.

1093
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:13,526
You know, it is
really hard to tell.

1094
00:56:13,528 --> 00:56:15,658
Oh my God, I so feel that.

1095
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,530
You know, you know what it is?

1096
00:56:17,532 --> 00:56:20,535
Rachel is the like
shy, silent type.

1097
00:56:21,797 --> 00:56:23,754
You know, you've got
to put in the work.

1098
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:26,931
Like the full court
press and shit.

1099
00:56:26,933 --> 00:56:28,717
Full court press?

1100
00:56:29,805 --> 00:56:31,631
Okay.

1101
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:32,806
Well thank you, Nicole.

1102
00:56:32,808 --> 00:56:34,636
Hey, no prob, Bob.

1103
00:56:38,118 --> 00:56:39,639
So Amber was going
out with Justin.

1104
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:40,727
And you know what she found out?

1105
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:42,163
They're related.

1106
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,338
I mean it's like second
cousins like once removed

1107
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,036
or whatever but
like still, like ew.

1108
00:56:45,038 --> 00:56:46,864
But she still agreed to
go out on a date with him,

1109
00:56:46,866 --> 00:56:48,387
and so she was telling me about
it and I decided to be like

1110
00:56:48,389 --> 00:56:49,910
"Sure, it's so great" whatever.

1111
00:56:49,912 --> 00:56:52,086
And then she told me this,
and you can't tell anybody.

1112
00:56:52,088 --> 00:56:52,870
I won't, I swear.

1113
00:56:52,872 --> 00:56:54,219
Okay.

1114
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:55,873
She said that after
giving him oral sex,

1115
00:56:55,875 --> 00:57:01,010
she felt so guilty about it
that she cried on his penis.

1116
00:57:01,706 --> 00:57:02,618
Oh my God.

1117
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,532
I know, I can't believe it.

1118
00:57:03,534 --> 00:57:04,927
It's totally embarrassing.

1119
00:57:06,407 --> 00:57:07,798
Make your famous
popcorn for Dog Tooth.

1120
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,409
What are you so happy about?

1121
00:57:10,411 --> 00:57:11,584
Who's that?

1122
00:57:11,586 --> 00:57:12,803
It's nobody.

1123
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:15,022
No, like seriously
who was that?

1124
00:57:15,024 --> 00:57:16,676
Oh my God, what's his name?

1125
00:57:16,678 --> 00:57:18,460
It's nobody you know.

1126
00:57:18,462 --> 00:57:19,897
Plus I don't want to jinx it.

1127
00:57:19,899 --> 00:57:22,029
Well be careful, Rachel.

1128
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:24,945
You know, you don't want
to rush into these things.

1129
00:57:24,947 --> 00:57:26,904
You still have a fragile heart.

1130
00:57:55,499 --> 00:57:57,804
This movie is so weird.

1131
00:57:57,806 --> 00:57:58,674
I know.

1132
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:05,335
I'm cold.

1133
00:58:10,993 --> 00:58:12,952
Oh my God, look at this.

1134
00:58:23,092 --> 00:58:25,397
She called
herself an open book.

1135
00:58:25,399 --> 00:58:28,095
Which may have been true.

1136
00:58:28,097 --> 00:58:30,402
A book with faded print.

1137
00:58:30,404 --> 00:58:33,057
Written in a language
with no rules.

1138
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:36,060
No structure whatsoever.

1139
00:58:36,062 --> 00:58:39,456
But so intriguing is
the art of the chase.

1140
00:58:40,457 --> 00:58:41,979
So attractive is the...

1141
00:58:46,202 --> 00:58:49,116
Trevor really likes you.

1142
00:58:49,118 --> 00:58:52,424
Have you talked
to Cameron at all?

1143
00:58:52,426 --> 00:58:53,209
Nope.

1144
00:58:54,384 --> 00:58:57,603
Maybe he was getting
his feet fucked.

1145
00:58:57,605 --> 00:59:00,519
It's the only viable excuse.

1146
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:05,132
It was weird the stuff he
was saying about sexuality.

1147
00:59:05,134 --> 00:59:08,440
Yeah, I try not to
listen when he speaks.

1148
00:59:08,442 --> 00:59:11,008
The stuff about like
women not being able

1149
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:13,577
to separate sex from emotion.

1150
00:59:15,014 --> 00:59:18,058
Oh yeah, and about us
chowing each others' boxes.

1151
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:21,020
And look, we put it
all into practice.

1152
00:59:23,065 --> 00:59:26,023
Should we talk about that?

1153
00:59:26,025 --> 00:59:28,025
What is there to talk about?

1154
00:59:28,027 --> 00:59:29,983
We're cool, right?

1155
00:59:29,985 --> 00:59:30,986
Yeah.

1156
00:59:35,077 --> 00:59:37,164
Sorry about Cameron.

1157
00:59:37,166 --> 00:59:38,037
Don't be.

1158
00:59:44,826 --> 00:59:45,958
Good night.

1159
01:00:05,586 --> 01:00:07,499
Do you want to go to
lunch with Jessica and I?

1160
01:00:07,501 --> 01:00:08,804
No thanks.

1161
01:00:08,806 --> 01:00:12,156
I have a date with
the professor today.

1162
01:00:12,158 --> 01:00:12,985
Oh.

1163
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:16,638
What are you doing with that?

1164
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,120
What do you mean?

1165
01:00:19,426 --> 01:00:22,081
Like, what are
your intentions?

1166
01:00:23,517 --> 01:00:24,997
To go to lunch,

1167
01:00:26,172 --> 01:00:28,911
maybe take his photograph?

1168
01:00:28,913 --> 01:00:32,263
Are you trying
to, what, date him?

1169
01:00:32,265 --> 01:00:33,090
Why not?

1170
01:00:33,092 --> 01:00:34,091
He's brilliant.

1171
01:00:34,093 --> 01:00:34,917
He's charming.

1172
01:00:34,919 --> 01:00:36,354
Devastatingly handsome.

1173
01:00:36,356 --> 01:00:38,617
You're just going to end
up hurting him, Nicole.

1174
01:00:38,619 --> 01:00:40,140
I know you.

1175
01:00:40,142 --> 01:00:41,707
You're going to have your fun,

1176
01:00:41,709 --> 01:00:44,231
and you're just going
to toss him aside.

1177
01:00:44,233 --> 01:00:46,061
It's not going to last.

1178
01:00:48,672 --> 01:00:51,023
Well, like you said, Rach,

1179
01:00:52,285 --> 01:00:56,417
he's an old man so I'm
pretty sure he knows how to

1180
01:00:56,419 --> 01:01:00,597
handle himself by now, but
thanks for your concern.

1181
01:01:10,781 --> 01:01:13,434
You look really pretty.

1182
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,047
Thanks, you too.

1183
01:01:48,645 --> 01:01:49,949
Tell the professor

1184
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,607
I said.

1185
01:01:58,133 --> 01:01:59,741
And this
is why we're here.

1186
01:01:59,743 --> 01:02:01,308
I don't know what it is with
all the beautiful things

1187
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,789
in here I keep
going back to this.

1188
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:05,312
Isn't it gorgeous?

1189
01:02:05,314 --> 01:02:07,184
Absolutely.

1190
01:02:07,186 --> 01:02:08,794
Like you, my dear.

1191
01:02:08,796 --> 01:02:09,708
Stop it.

1192
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:11,188
No don't stop, keep going.

1193
01:02:13,148 --> 01:02:15,148
Here, please do me
the honor of posing

1194
01:02:15,150 --> 01:02:16,758
right here on this pillar.

1195
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,064
Oh no, no, no.

1196
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:20,197
Please, Professore,
you can't, you have to.

1197
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:21,676
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1198
01:02:21,678 --> 01:02:22,592
Okay, okay.

1199
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,203
You've
reached Charles Harwell.

1200
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:27,726
Please leave a detailed message.

1201
01:02:27,728 --> 01:02:31,469
Hey, Charles, it's
Rachel, Rachel Nolan.

1202
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:35,429
Look, please give me
a call back, okay?

1203
01:02:35,431 --> 01:02:36,432
Thanks, bye.

1204
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:39,305
Okay, ready?

1205
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:45,657
Professor, I don't
mean to alarm you.

1206
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:47,224
You are extremely handsome.

1207
01:02:47,226 --> 01:02:48,442
Now, don't break character.

1208
01:02:48,444 --> 01:02:50,009
Let's go, let's
go, stoic, serious.

1209
01:02:50,011 --> 01:02:50,836
Ready?

1210
01:02:50,838 --> 01:02:51,793
Okay.

1211
01:03:41,454 --> 01:03:42,279
Hi, mom.

1212
01:03:42,281 --> 01:03:43,628
Hi, stranger.

1213
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:44,411
Mom...

1214
01:03:44,413 --> 01:03:45,717
Oh I know, I know.

1215
01:03:45,719 --> 01:03:47,109
I'm putting it on
a little too thick,

1216
01:03:47,111 --> 01:03:49,764
but I just miss you, that's all.

1217
01:03:49,766 --> 01:03:50,983
How's dad?

1218
01:03:50,985 --> 01:03:53,377
Oh, you know dad.

1219
01:03:53,379 --> 01:03:54,204
He's the same.

1220
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:55,117
He's fine.

1221
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:56,554
Hey, how are you?

1222
01:03:56,556 --> 01:03:57,859
How is work?

1223
01:03:57,861 --> 01:04:00,558
Oh well, you know,
it's a paycheck.

1224
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,646
Every week.

1225
01:04:01,648 --> 01:04:02,951
Yeah?

1226
01:04:02,953 --> 01:04:05,302
How is that essay
thing coming along?

1227
01:04:05,304 --> 01:04:07,521
It's a novel, mom.

1228
01:04:07,523 --> 01:04:11,221
And it's, it's going
to fall through.

1229
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:13,225
Oh, honey, I am so sorry.

1230
01:04:16,315 --> 01:04:20,404
Well, I always say you only
learn by bad experiences.

1231
01:04:20,406 --> 01:04:23,102
Yep, you do always say that.

1232
01:04:23,104 --> 01:04:25,452
Rachel, I know the
nine-to-five isn't all the glitz

1233
01:04:25,454 --> 01:04:27,541
and glamour that
you could imagine,

1234
01:04:27,543 --> 01:04:30,022
but you are a sensible girl,

1235
01:04:30,024 --> 01:04:33,286
and I don't know,
maybe you could

1236
01:04:33,288 --> 01:04:35,114
do that writing thing
as a hobby, huh?

1237
01:04:35,116 --> 01:04:36,248
Or just for fun.

1238
01:04:37,466 --> 01:04:38,467
Yeah, fun.

1239
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:40,467
Yeah.

1240
01:04:40,469 --> 01:04:42,426
And then when you and Richard,

1241
01:04:42,428 --> 01:04:46,821
you settle down and talk
about raising a family.

1242
01:04:46,823 --> 01:04:48,475
You're really
going to appreciate

1243
01:04:48,477 --> 01:04:50,216
having that paycheck
once a week.

1244
01:04:50,218 --> 01:04:51,480
Believe you me.

1245
01:04:54,483 --> 01:04:59,051
The boundaries of
relationships are a farce.

1246
01:04:59,053 --> 01:05:02,359
You know, they're just
like, they're not there.

1247
01:05:02,361 --> 01:05:05,100
Because when you're
in a relationship,

1248
01:05:05,102 --> 01:05:06,885
you're in it.

1249
01:05:06,887 --> 01:05:09,757
Well no one's like
really in it, in it.

1250
01:05:09,759 --> 01:05:12,194
You know what I mean?

1251
01:05:12,196 --> 01:05:14,677
It's just me and I'm all alone.

1252
01:05:18,464 --> 01:05:20,640
My heart was once like this.

1253
01:05:23,033 --> 01:05:24,383
But now it's this.

1254
01:05:29,431 --> 01:05:30,258
I mean,

1255
01:05:32,521 --> 01:05:34,610
you know how I'm feeling.

1256
01:05:35,785 --> 01:05:37,352
You were in Vietnam.

1257
01:05:40,529 --> 01:05:41,789
Hold on.

1258
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:43,924
I'm going to make a call.

1259
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:46,405
Hello?

1260
01:05:47,884 --> 01:05:49,449
You've got to,

1261
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:51,540
you've got to press dial.

1262
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:56,543
Hello?

1263
01:05:56,545 --> 01:05:58,417
Wondering where I am?

1264
01:06:00,462 --> 01:06:01,766
Where are you?

1265
01:06:01,768 --> 01:06:03,245
I don't know.

1266
01:06:03,247 --> 01:06:04,423
Where are you?

1267
01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:07,032
I'm walking home.

1268
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:08,860
How much have you had to drink?

1269
01:06:08,862 --> 01:06:10,122
Not enough.

1270
01:06:10,124 --> 01:06:14,169
Because my heart is
still.

1271
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:15,475
Please find out where you are.

1272
01:06:15,477 --> 01:06:17,608
How am I supposed to do that?

1273
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:19,958
Hand the phone to someone
less drunk than you.

1274
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:23,004
That would be anyone in the bar.

1275
01:06:25,269 --> 01:06:26,401
You've got it.

1276
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:33,450
Hello, can you help me?

1277
01:06:33,452 --> 01:06:34,973
I don't know where I am.

1278
01:06:34,975 --> 01:06:36,540
Oh, oh hello?

1279
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:38,498
Honey, she's at Louie's.

1280
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,021
Gracias, can you
give her the phone please?

1281
01:06:40,023 --> 01:06:40,761
Okay.

1282
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:41,936
Thank you so much.

1283
01:06:41,938 --> 01:06:42,807
Thank you.

1284
01:06:42,809 --> 01:06:43,590
Sure.

1285
01:06:43,592 --> 01:06:45,636
You're really like.

1286
01:06:45,638 --> 01:06:46,898
Here, thank you.

1287
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:49,030
Oh jeez, I'm so sorry.

1288
01:06:49,032 --> 01:06:50,467
Okay, sure.

1289
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:51,470
Thank you.

1290
01:06:52,688 --> 01:06:54,209
Thank you, thank you.

1291
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:56,690
- Ah, it's okay.
- I'm sorry.

1292
01:06:56,692 --> 01:06:59,216
This will pass.

1293
01:07:04,352 --> 01:07:05,699
Dee de dit.

1294
01:07:05,701 --> 01:07:07,571
Dee de dit.

1295
01:07:07,573 --> 01:07:08,400
Whoo!

1296
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:11,577
This one's for you, Roger!

1297
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:14,665
Look at me now boys!

1298
01:07:14,667 --> 01:07:15,622
Okay, Shirley Temple.

1299
01:07:15,624 --> 01:07:16,623
Time to go home.

1300
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:19,411
Nikki, it's so
good to see you!

1301
01:07:20,847 --> 01:07:22,063
Oh, look, look.

1302
01:07:22,065 --> 01:07:23,284
This is Roger.

1303
01:07:24,546 --> 01:07:25,371
Hi Roger.

1304
01:07:25,373 --> 01:07:26,894
His mother is Greek.

1305
01:07:26,896 --> 01:07:28,940
His father is not Greek.

1306
01:07:28,942 --> 01:07:29,725
Great.

1307
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:33,118
But, we're going to be
travelling the world together

1308
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,772
on his motorcycle.

1309
01:07:34,774 --> 01:07:36,034
Okay, it's time to go home.

1310
01:07:36,036 --> 01:07:37,775
I don't even
have a motorcycle.

1311
01:07:37,777 --> 01:07:39,341
We're actors.

1312
01:07:39,343 --> 01:07:40,734
We're just here, we
just got off set.

1313
01:07:40,736 --> 01:07:42,170
This isn't even a real goatee.

1314
01:07:42,172 --> 01:07:44,216
Roger, I don't care.

1315
01:07:44,218 --> 01:07:45,304
Okay?

1316
01:07:45,306 --> 01:07:46,087
Time to go.

1317
01:07:46,089 --> 01:07:47,001
No I want to...

1318
01:07:53,009 --> 01:07:55,445
Been in
the city long, or?

1319
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:58,665
Well, I studied biochemical
engineering at Cornell,

1320
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:00,841
but then I moved back to
the city to pursue acting.

1321
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:01,625
Oh, really?

1322
01:08:01,627 --> 01:08:02,671
That's..

1323
01:08:03,585 --> 01:08:04,889
You know what, this is us,

1324
01:08:04,891 --> 01:08:08,503
so why don't you just
let her down, gently.

1325
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:14,289
Roger and his blushing bride.

1326
01:08:14,291 --> 01:08:15,856
Thanks, Roger.

1327
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:18,948
Could I take a photo
of your nipples?

1328
01:08:25,738 --> 01:08:29,957
I like it when you sit with
me while I'm in the bath.

1329
01:08:29,959 --> 01:08:31,570
While I'm bathing.

1330
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:36,050
Well I like it when
you don't drown, so.

1331
01:08:36,052 --> 01:08:37,750
Don't be mad at me.

1332
01:08:38,577 --> 01:08:39,795
Where's Roger?

1333
01:08:41,144 --> 01:08:43,669
He's in a better place now.

1334
01:08:45,671 --> 01:08:46,844
Here you go.

1335
01:08:46,846 --> 01:08:47,845
Here you go.

1336
01:08:56,725 --> 01:08:59,857
So you getting trashed is
obviously not getting you

1337
01:08:59,859 --> 01:09:03,469
over Richard, so we need
to find a new tactic.

1338
01:09:03,471 --> 01:09:07,038
I don't want to
get over Richard.

1339
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,565
Besides, Roger and I
are getting married.

1340
01:09:12,654 --> 01:09:14,787
You need a rebound guy.

1341
01:09:16,005 --> 01:09:19,529
Not Roger nor any of the
other Sons of Anarchy.

1342
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:21,533
Like a real human being.

1343
01:09:22,664 --> 01:09:23,665
Like Trevor.

1344
01:09:30,324 --> 01:09:32,326
Can we just go to bed?

1345
01:09:34,154 --> 01:09:34,937
Yeah.

1346
01:09:38,245 --> 01:09:39,549
Carry me.

1347
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:40,854
Okay, don't
slip and fall, okay?

1348
01:09:40,856 --> 01:09:41,988
Pick me up.

1349
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:44,556
Okay.

1350
01:10:05,011 --> 01:10:06,099
I love you.

1351
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:07,883
You too.

1352
01:10:12,366 --> 01:10:14,673
Let's just go to bed, okay?

1353
01:10:18,067 --> 01:10:20,851
The bed had suddenly
become crowded.

1354
01:10:20,853 --> 01:10:23,682
The space between us unbearable.

1355
01:10:25,118 --> 01:10:26,685
But who had changed?

1356
01:10:28,643 --> 01:10:29,426
Was it me?

1357
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:50,837
Charles.

1358
01:10:50,839 --> 01:10:52,709
Rachel, I'm
returning your call.

1359
01:10:52,711 --> 01:10:54,103
Right, thank you.

1360
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:56,843
Is everything all right?

1361
01:10:56,845 --> 01:10:58,584
I mean, you didn't sound well.

1362
01:10:58,586 --> 01:11:00,455
Yeah, everything is fine.

1363
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:01,241
It's good.

1364
01:11:02,764 --> 01:11:04,416
Great in fact.

1365
01:11:04,418 --> 01:11:06,157
I was calling to tell you
that I've been thinking

1366
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,813
about our conversation, and,

1367
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:11,643
and I've been writing.

1368
01:11:13,688 --> 01:11:14,950
It's a new piece.

1369
01:11:16,082 --> 01:11:17,734
It's inspired.

1370
01:11:17,736 --> 01:11:19,692
It's passionate.

1371
01:11:19,694 --> 01:11:21,868
I think you're going to love it.

1372
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:22,826
Yes, well I,

1373
01:11:22,828 --> 01:11:25,089
I look forward to reading it.

1374
01:11:25,091 --> 01:11:25,874
Yes, do.

1375
01:11:27,702 --> 01:11:29,006
I won't let you down again.

1376
01:11:29,008 --> 01:11:30,660
Rachel,

1377
01:11:30,662 --> 01:11:33,053
I hope you know this is not
about you letting me down.

1378
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:34,446
Now if you need some
more time, I'm sure...

1379
01:11:34,448 --> 01:11:35,490
Charles, I'm so sorry.

1380
01:11:35,492 --> 01:11:36,535
It's Nicole on the other line.

1381
01:11:36,537 --> 01:11:37,754
I think it may be an emergency.

1382
01:11:37,756 --> 01:11:39,758
I'll call you soon okay?

1383
01:11:43,979 --> 01:11:45,196
Hello?

1384
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:45,892
I'm
picking up your stuff.

1385
01:11:45,894 --> 01:11:46,719
What?

1386
01:11:46,721 --> 01:11:47,502
When are you going?

1387
01:11:47,504 --> 01:11:48,286
I'll come meet you.

1388
01:11:49,593 --> 01:11:51,811
No, I'm already
here, it's happening.

1389
01:11:51,813 --> 01:11:52,638
I'm on my way.

1390
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:53,770
Hey, Rach?

1391
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:54,771
Rachel?

1392
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:56,860
Stay where you are, okay?

1393
01:11:56,862 --> 01:11:57,645
Hold on.

1394
01:12:01,388 --> 01:12:02,169
Oh, my God.

1395
01:12:02,171 --> 01:12:03,042
Oh, my God.

1396
01:12:03,999 --> 01:12:05,433
Oh, Nicole.

1397
01:12:05,435 --> 01:12:06,739
Richard, hi.

1398
01:12:06,741 --> 01:12:07,653
I'm just here to pick
up Rachel's things.

1399
01:12:07,655 --> 01:12:09,481
I'll be out in just a few, okay?

1400
01:12:14,314 --> 01:12:15,574
Hmm.

1401
01:12:15,576 --> 01:12:18,620
Alright, this way.

1402
01:12:18,622 --> 01:12:19,883
You have
a beautiful home.

1403
01:12:19,885 --> 01:12:21,754
Did your grandmother
help you decorate or?

1404
01:12:21,756 --> 01:12:24,452
I go to a lot of estate sales.

1405
01:12:24,454 --> 01:12:26,933
That makes all
of the sense in the world.

1406
01:12:26,935 --> 01:12:28,979
So how is she doing?

1407
01:12:28,981 --> 01:12:30,284
She's great man.

1408
01:12:30,286 --> 01:12:32,809
She's actually like really good.

1409
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:34,114
Really?

1410
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:35,812
That's good to hear.

1411
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:38,292
She certainly loved plushies.

1412
01:12:38,294 --> 01:12:39,731
That she does.

1413
01:12:42,429 --> 01:12:43,689
Sorry.

1414
01:12:43,691 --> 01:12:45,778
It's alright, Richard.

1415
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:48,041
I mean, you guys
both kind of knew

1416
01:12:48,043 --> 01:12:50,000
it was going south
for awhile, right?

1417
01:12:50,002 --> 01:12:51,175
Yeah.

1418
01:12:51,177 --> 01:12:52,959
I guess so.

1419
01:12:52,961 --> 01:12:54,569
You know, you're
just so conservative,

1420
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:57,007
I don't think she's
really free to be herself.

1421
01:12:57,009 --> 01:12:57,834
You know what I mean?

1422
01:12:57,836 --> 01:12:59,139
Right.

1423
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,706
But she's doing
so much better now,

1424
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:02,839
so I'm glad it
was a clean break,

1425
01:13:02,841 --> 01:13:04,754
and no hard feelings, right?

1426
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:05,667
None.

1427
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:07,191
Well, hey, it's been real.

1428
01:13:07,193 --> 01:13:09,280
Peace out, Goux!

1429
01:13:09,282 --> 01:13:10,065
Later.

1430
01:13:16,593 --> 01:13:19,246
You should have seen
the look on his face.

1431
01:13:19,248 --> 01:13:20,726
Fuck.

1432
01:13:20,728 --> 01:13:22,249
I should have snap-chatted it.

1433
01:13:22,251 --> 01:13:23,860
Defending my honor.

1434
01:13:23,862 --> 01:13:26,863
Wow, you're a better
boyfriend than he was.

1435
01:13:26,865 --> 01:13:29,822
Hey, Rach, remember
when we talked about you

1436
01:13:29,824 --> 01:13:31,563
getting weird?

1437
01:13:31,565 --> 01:13:34,000
Hey, hold on a second.

1438
01:13:34,002 --> 01:13:35,349
Oh my God, it's him.

1439
01:13:35,351 --> 01:13:36,135
What?

1440
01:13:37,049 --> 01:13:38,396
Richard.

1441
01:13:38,398 --> 01:13:39,266
Hello.

1442
01:13:39,268 --> 01:13:40,224
Hello?

1443
01:13:40,226 --> 01:13:42,182
Rachel, how are you?

1444
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:45,272
Doing well,
Richard, very well.

1445
01:13:45,274 --> 01:13:46,883
That's great to hear.

1446
01:13:46,885 --> 01:13:48,885
You were pretty shaken
up when you left.

1447
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:51,844
I thought for sure you'd call.

1448
01:13:51,846 --> 01:13:55,065
Anyway, I was thinking
maybe we should go

1449
01:13:55,067 --> 01:13:58,897
get a cup of coffee so
we can talk about it.

1450
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:00,722
It would be nice to
get some closure...

1451
01:14:00,724 --> 01:14:01,811
Richard.

1452
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:03,116
Yes?

1453
01:14:03,118 --> 01:14:04,248
No.

1454
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:05,423
What?

1455
01:14:05,425 --> 01:14:06,208
Bye.

1456
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:12,909
Who are you
talking to, Richie?

1457
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:14,042
Oh, no one.

1458
01:14:43,898 --> 01:14:44,941
Nicole's phone.

1459
01:14:46,074 --> 01:14:46,986
Nicole, you will
never believe it.

1460
01:14:46,988 --> 01:14:49,510
Guess who grew a pair of balls?

1461
01:14:49,512 --> 01:14:52,905
He asked me out for coffee,
and I was just like "No.

1462
01:14:52,907 --> 01:14:53,906
"No."

1463
01:14:53,908 --> 01:14:55,168
And I hung up the phone.

1464
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:56,343
It was amazing.

1465
01:14:56,345 --> 01:14:57,433
Call me back.

1466
01:14:59,087 --> 01:14:59,871
Call me.

1467
01:15:27,507 --> 01:15:30,118
Good luck with that Iawaska.

1468
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:35,643
The question is, where
is your girlfriend tonight?

1469
01:15:35,645 --> 01:15:36,862
Well, she's right
here actually.

1470
01:15:36,864 --> 01:15:38,124
No, stop it.

1471
01:15:38,126 --> 01:15:38,908
Yes, it is
my way disgusting way

1472
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:39,647
of saying I'm single

1473
01:15:39,649 --> 01:15:40,866
Oh, okay.

1474
01:15:40,868 --> 01:15:41,388
Well your misfortune
is my fortune.

1475
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:42,476
Hi.

1476
01:15:42,478 --> 01:15:44,000
Oh, hey Rach.

1477
01:15:44,002 --> 01:15:46,265
Guys, do you remember Rachel?

1478
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:50,269
Hey, Rachel.

1479
01:15:51,966 --> 01:15:54,401
Nicole, can I talk
to you for a minute?

1480
01:15:54,403 --> 01:15:55,707
Yeah, sure.

1481
01:15:55,709 --> 01:15:57,145
I'll be right back.

1482
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:03,106
What's up?

1483
01:16:03,108 --> 01:16:05,064
What are all these
people doing here?

1484
01:16:05,066 --> 01:16:08,981
All of these people
are friends from work.

1485
01:16:08,983 --> 01:16:10,156
I invited them over.

1486
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:11,462
Trevor is not your friend.

1487
01:16:11,464 --> 01:16:13,768
You didn't even know his
name until this week.

1488
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:17,903
Well I thought that maybe
you would want to see him.

1489
01:16:17,905 --> 01:16:21,256
Don't you think it's
a little fucked up?

1490
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:27,175
You, are you on
your moon cycle?

1491
01:16:30,004 --> 01:16:31,221
Tough day at work.

1492
01:16:31,223 --> 01:16:32,700
It happens to the best of us.

1493
01:16:32,702 --> 01:16:33,614
Hey.

1494
01:16:33,616 --> 01:16:34,441
Hey.

1495
01:16:34,443 --> 01:16:35,529
Is she all right?

1496
01:16:35,531 --> 01:16:37,183
Yeah, no she's fine.

1497
01:16:37,185 --> 01:16:38,402
You know what?

1498
01:16:38,404 --> 01:16:40,708
You should go upstairs
and go get her.

1499
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:42,014
Make her come down here.

1500
01:16:42,016 --> 01:16:42,797
What?

1501
01:16:42,799 --> 01:16:44,060
Yes, go.

1502
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:44,799
Please, dazzle her with
your wit and charm.

1503
01:16:44,801 --> 01:16:46,236
No, no, no, no...

1504
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:47,150
Yes, if anyone can get
her to come down it's you.

1505
01:16:47,152 --> 01:16:47,585
In fact I order you.

1506
01:16:47,587 --> 01:16:48,281
You go.

1507
01:16:48,283 --> 01:16:49,065
You go now.

1508
01:16:49,067 --> 01:16:50,022
Go.

1509
01:16:50,024 --> 01:16:51,328
Okay, alright, alright.

1510
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:52,242
I will not take
no for an answer.

1511
01:16:52,244 --> 01:16:53,156
Okay, here, take my drink.

1512
01:16:53,158 --> 01:16:54,157
Okay, thank you, you go.

1513
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:54,940
I'll go get her.

1514
01:16:54,942 --> 01:16:55,987
You need two hands.

1515
01:17:00,426 --> 01:17:03,122
Is this where
all the cool kids hang out?

1516
01:17:03,124 --> 01:17:04,515
Hey, Trevor.

1517
01:17:04,517 --> 01:17:06,604
Hey, I don't want to
interrupt you or anything.

1518
01:17:06,606 --> 01:17:07,431
Oh, no, you're fine.

1519
01:17:07,433 --> 01:17:08,214
Come on in.

1520
01:17:08,216 --> 01:17:09,346
Cool.

1521
01:17:09,348 --> 01:17:10,260
May I sit down?

1522
01:17:10,262 --> 01:17:13,002
Yeah, please, have a seat.

1523
01:17:13,004 --> 01:17:14,046
Nice couch.

1524
01:17:14,048 --> 01:17:15,221
Yeah, thanks.

1525
01:17:15,223 --> 01:17:16,962
It looks like a
smurf got murdered.

1526
01:17:16,964 --> 01:17:17,789
It did.

1527
01:17:17,791 --> 01:17:19,921
I buried it in the back.

1528
01:17:19,923 --> 01:17:21,140
So watch out.

1529
01:17:21,142 --> 01:17:22,054
Wild.

1530
01:17:22,056 --> 01:17:24,100
Pretty wild.

1531
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:26,189
I see that you've been
putting my little gift

1532
01:17:26,191 --> 01:17:27,538
to good use over here.

1533
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:29,583
Yeah, I've about
filled every page.

1534
01:17:29,585 --> 01:17:30,584
Let's open it up, first page.

1535
01:17:30,586 --> 01:17:32,934
Are you making love in here?

1536
01:17:32,936 --> 01:17:34,327
Do not move a muscle.

1537
01:17:34,329 --> 01:17:35,589
Stay right there.

1538
01:17:35,591 --> 01:17:37,461
Nicole, I'm really
not in the mood.

1539
01:17:37,463 --> 01:17:39,637
Look, you can't deny me, okay?

1540
01:17:39,639 --> 01:17:40,942
It's for my next project.

1541
01:17:40,944 --> 01:17:41,726
It's perfect.

1542
01:17:41,728 --> 01:17:43,162
Do not move.

1543
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:45,686
This is the famous
photographer Nicole Weinberg.

1544
01:17:45,688 --> 01:17:47,732
We can't deny her.

1545
01:17:47,734 --> 01:17:48,733
Smart man.

1546
01:17:48,735 --> 01:17:49,951
Okay, one photo.

1547
01:17:49,953 --> 01:17:51,170
That's all I need.

1548
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:53,172
Okay, now why don't you
lean in as if you're

1549
01:17:53,174 --> 01:17:55,783
whispering sweet nothings
into Rachel's ear.

1550
01:17:55,785 --> 01:17:56,569
Go ahead.

1551
01:17:59,354 --> 01:18:00,223
Perfect.

1552
01:18:00,225 --> 01:18:02,790
I think you're cute.

1553
01:18:02,792 --> 01:18:05,184
This is so stupid.

1554
01:18:05,186 --> 01:18:07,578
You two, are
beautiful together.

1555
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:08,927
Okay?

1556
01:18:08,929 --> 01:18:12,670
Now come downstairs
my anti-socialites.

1557
01:18:12,672 --> 01:18:14,411
Yes, she has a point.

1558
01:18:14,413 --> 01:18:15,194
I guess.

1559
01:18:15,196 --> 01:18:16,241
My lady.

1560
01:18:17,155 --> 01:18:17,938
My lord.

1561
01:18:28,122 --> 01:18:30,342
Michael put the beast away.

1562
01:18:32,692 --> 01:18:34,607
The policia are coming.

1563
01:18:39,307 --> 01:18:41,786
Hey, are you okay?

1564
01:18:41,788 --> 01:18:43,962
Yeah, I'm fine.

1565
01:18:43,964 --> 01:18:46,095
Okay, I'm going to
go get you a drink.

1566
01:18:46,097 --> 01:18:46,880
Okay.

1567
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:54,842
Fuck you, put it in
your god damned mouth.

1568
01:18:54,844 --> 01:18:57,889
Put it in your god damned mouth.

1569
01:19:00,154 --> 01:19:01,066
I am loving this.

1570
01:19:01,068 --> 01:19:03,112
Please wear a condom.

1571
01:19:03,114 --> 01:19:04,243
Good to see you, call me later.

1572
01:19:04,245 --> 01:19:05,070
I love you.

1573
01:19:05,072 --> 01:19:05,855
Bye.

1574
01:19:06,682 --> 01:19:08,554
And good night, Trevor.

1575
01:19:09,903 --> 01:19:11,034
Good night.

1576
01:19:19,217 --> 01:19:21,132
A penny for your thoughts?

1577
01:19:23,221 --> 01:19:26,659
Do you ever feel
like you don't really

1578
01:19:28,269 --> 01:19:29,227
know yourself?

1579
01:19:32,491 --> 01:19:34,186
It's terrifying,

1580
01:19:34,188 --> 01:19:38,234
because you start to look
at your relationships

1581
01:19:38,236 --> 01:19:39,411
and you think,

1582
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:44,109
like, "How well do
I know this person?"

1583
01:19:44,111 --> 01:19:45,808
Like truly know them?

1584
01:19:47,245 --> 01:19:48,200
And how could I?

1585
01:19:48,202 --> 01:19:50,335
How could I know someone if I

1586
01:19:51,727 --> 01:19:53,599
don't even know myself?

1587
01:19:56,906 --> 01:19:59,429
And you start to think, like,
how much of them is real?

1588
01:19:59,431 --> 01:20:03,174
Or how much of them is
this myth I made up?

1589
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,222
You know, am I deluding myself?

1590
01:20:10,746 --> 01:20:14,400
Am I just looking for
any random sack of meat

1591
01:20:14,402 --> 01:20:17,536
to project my hopes
or my dreams, or,

1592
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:21,320
God I don't even know
what I want to say.

1593
01:20:21,322 --> 01:20:22,147
No, no, no, no.

1594
01:20:22,149 --> 01:20:23,061
Hey.

1595
01:20:23,063 --> 01:20:25,065
Hey, I definitely get it.

1596
01:20:33,508 --> 01:20:37,249
I just, I really need
a friend right now.

1597
01:20:37,251 --> 01:20:38,339
Oh, yeah.

1598
01:20:40,211 --> 01:20:41,427
Oh, I'm sorry.

1599
01:20:41,429 --> 01:20:44,302
I didn't really, I
didn't mean to come on.

1600
01:20:47,348 --> 01:20:49,916
Hey, I'd love to be your friend.

1601
01:20:52,266 --> 01:20:53,047
Yeah?

1602
01:20:53,049 --> 01:20:53,789
Yeah.

1603
01:20:56,270 --> 01:20:58,229
I'm going to head out.

1604
01:21:00,056 --> 01:21:02,015
And I'll see you around.

1605
01:21:04,322 --> 01:21:05,582
Okay?

1606
01:21:05,584 --> 01:21:06,713
Okay.

1607
01:21:06,715 --> 01:21:08,935
Cool, have a good night.

1608
01:21:29,347 --> 01:21:31,172
Sorry about earlier.

1609
01:21:31,174 --> 01:21:34,350
Don't worry about it.

1610
01:21:34,352 --> 01:21:36,439
It's just there were all
these people here when I got

1611
01:21:36,441 --> 01:21:38,397
home from work and just didn't...

1612
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:40,834
Hey Rach, remember
that conversation we had

1613
01:21:40,836 --> 01:21:42,488
at the gallery where
you talked about

1614
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:45,274
not wanting to be
needy or weird?

1615
01:21:45,276 --> 01:21:46,492
Well, you're doing it
and it makes me not want

1616
01:21:46,494 --> 01:21:47,974
to be around you.

1617
01:21:52,457 --> 01:21:53,369
You're going out?

1618
01:21:53,371 --> 01:21:54,457
Yep.

1619
01:21:54,459 --> 01:21:55,286
See ya later.

1620
01:21:58,854 --> 01:22:00,291
Cool, have fun.

1621
01:22:56,564 --> 01:22:57,476
Hello.

1622
01:22:57,478 --> 01:22:59,217
Hey, what's up?

1623
01:22:59,219 --> 01:23:00,566
Hey, I'm kind of
busy, what's up?

1624
01:23:00,568 --> 01:23:04,440
Well, are you going
to be home later or?

1625
01:23:04,442 --> 01:23:05,484
Yeah, I think so.

1626
01:23:05,486 --> 01:23:07,834
Cool, let's hang out.

1627
01:23:07,836 --> 01:23:08,792
Cool, sure.

1628
01:23:08,794 --> 01:23:09,575
See ya later.

1629
01:23:09,577 --> 01:23:10,578
Okay, bye.

1630
01:23:32,731 --> 01:23:35,516
Hey,
it's Nicolas Cage.

1631
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,171
It's Trevor.

1632
01:23:42,088 --> 01:23:43,437
Honey, I'm home!

1633
01:23:53,578 --> 01:23:55,578
Where are you going?

1634
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:57,493
I've got a date
with the professor.

1635
01:23:57,495 --> 01:23:59,495
I thought we had plans.

1636
01:23:59,497 --> 01:24:02,064
I have Chinese food and booze.

1637
01:24:03,457 --> 01:24:05,109
We'll eat it tomorrow.

1638
01:24:05,111 --> 01:24:07,024
Chinese is better
the next day anyway.

1639
01:24:07,026 --> 01:24:10,375
Well, where are
you guys going?

1640
01:24:10,377 --> 01:24:13,075
Some restaurant
in Fort Greene.

1641
01:24:14,033 --> 01:24:16,947
When are you going to be home?

1642
01:24:16,949 --> 01:24:17,861
I don't know.

1643
01:24:17,863 --> 01:24:20,733
What's with the inquisition?

1644
01:24:20,735 --> 01:24:23,390
I just thought we had plans.

1645
01:24:25,523 --> 01:24:27,000
You'll survive.

1646
01:24:27,002 --> 01:24:27,958
Okay?

1647
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,048
See ya later.

1648
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:09,869
I run toward it.

1649
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:13,135
Gaining velocity, yet
the distance grows.

1650
01:25:14,006 --> 01:25:16,833
And still I dread a misstep

1651
01:25:16,835 --> 01:25:19,620
for fear I may
lose it completely.

1652
01:25:20,839 --> 01:25:23,668
But in reality,
it's already gone.

1653
01:25:32,938 --> 01:25:35,155
We look for comfort
where we can't find it.

1654
01:25:35,157 --> 01:25:36,635
Like a dream instantly forgotten

1655
01:25:36,637 --> 01:25:38,594
the moment you
reach the good part.

1656
01:25:38,596 --> 01:25:39,812
I wanted to freeze time

1657
01:25:39,814 --> 01:25:41,031
and just live in that
moment in tandem.

1658
01:25:41,033 --> 01:25:42,598
Like a dream,
instantly forgotten.

1659
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:44,643
Afraid of admitting
what I'm afraid of.

1660
01:25:44,645 --> 01:25:46,950
A sickness that doesn't
want to be healed.

1661
01:25:51,696 --> 01:25:52,914
Ugh, it's you.

1662
01:25:59,617 --> 01:26:00,356
Nicole?

1663
01:26:01,401 --> 01:26:02,184
Nicole.

1664
01:26:05,405 --> 01:26:06,188
Nicole?

1665
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:09,407
Hey, where's Nicole?

1666
01:26:09,409 --> 01:26:11,627
Nicole is on a
date with an old man.

1667
01:26:18,331 --> 01:26:19,460
I hate orange chicken.

1668
01:26:24,685 --> 01:26:25,858
What are you working on?

1669
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,294
Nothing.

1670
01:26:41,528 --> 01:26:44,616
I can't have you
drinking alone there.

1671
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:01,372
She's really upset
with you, you know.

1672
01:27:01,374 --> 01:27:03,809
What, did she say something?

1673
01:27:03,811 --> 01:27:04,595
No.

1674
01:27:06,118 --> 01:27:07,726
Of course not.

1675
01:27:07,728 --> 01:27:09,774
So, who are you upset with?

1676
01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:13,473
Nobody.

1677
01:27:16,694 --> 01:27:17,825
Myself, I guess.

1678
01:27:20,567 --> 01:27:22,132
Well that's pointless.

1679
01:27:22,134 --> 01:27:23,655
I'm just going to call her

1680
01:27:23,657 --> 01:27:26,005
and see what time
she's coming home.

1681
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:27,659
She's on a date.

1682
01:27:27,661 --> 01:27:28,793
She'll answer.

1683
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:35,406
I'm really sorry.

1684
01:27:35,408 --> 01:27:36,320
Do you mind if I?

1685
01:27:36,322 --> 01:27:37,669
I'm sorry.

1686
01:27:49,161 --> 01:27:50,379
Where were we?

1687
01:27:59,998 --> 01:28:00,825
It's her.

1688
01:28:01,695 --> 01:28:03,477
What's her?

1689
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:05,828
The reason why you're upset.

1690
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:07,743
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

1691
01:28:07,745 --> 01:28:09,483
Oh, don't I?

1692
01:28:09,485 --> 01:28:11,311
I mean I dated that
thing for two years.

1693
01:28:11,313 --> 01:28:12,791
Don't say shit like that.

1694
01:28:12,793 --> 01:28:14,706
Well you obviously have
some shit you need to say,

1695
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:16,057
so fucking say it.

1696
01:28:17,885 --> 01:28:19,015
Say it.

1697
01:28:19,017 --> 01:28:20,973
She's an inconsiderate
fucking bitch.

1698
01:28:20,975 --> 01:28:23,062
Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

1699
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:25,630
No, I didn't, I
didn't mean that.

1700
01:28:25,632 --> 01:28:26,892
You're right.

1701
01:28:26,894 --> 01:28:28,502
She is an inconsiderate
selfish little bitch.

1702
01:28:28,504 --> 01:28:29,982
It's everything on her terms.

1703
01:28:29,984 --> 01:28:31,899
She's my best friend.

1704
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:33,858
Come on.

1705
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:37,686
You grovel under her
like a sick puppy.

1706
01:28:37,688 --> 01:28:39,949
She's the authority
on your life.

1707
01:28:39,951 --> 01:28:41,254
I mean she cares
so much about you?

1708
01:28:41,256 --> 01:28:43,126
Here you are drinking
yourself into oblivion.

1709
01:28:43,128 --> 01:28:45,911
And she can't even
take your phone call.

1710
01:28:45,913 --> 01:28:50,263
Quite being such a fucking
pussy and do something about it.

1711
01:29:35,397 --> 01:29:36,179
Stop.

1712
01:29:36,181 --> 01:29:36,962
Stop.

1713
01:29:36,964 --> 01:29:37,789
What?

1714
01:29:37,791 --> 01:29:38,834
No, get off me.

1715
01:29:38,836 --> 01:29:40,009
Fuck, what?

1716
01:29:40,011 --> 01:29:41,184
This is
a terrible mistake.

1717
01:29:41,186 --> 01:29:42,228
You need to go.

1718
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:43,186
Go.

1719
01:29:43,188 --> 01:29:44,927
Get the fuck out of here.

1720
01:29:44,929 --> 01:29:46,450
Are you serious?

1721
01:29:46,452 --> 01:29:49,455
Just like two peas
in a fucking pod.

1722
01:29:58,029 --> 01:29:59,247
Hi, Cameron.

1723
01:30:12,217 --> 01:30:13,000
Nicole.

1724
01:30:14,219 --> 01:30:17,307
Are you
fucking kidding me?

1725
01:30:17,309 --> 01:30:18,221
Nicole, listen to me.

1726
01:30:18,223 --> 01:30:19,135
Is this a fucking joke?!

1727
01:30:19,137 --> 01:30:20,527
Are you fucking kidding me?

1728
01:30:20,529 --> 01:30:21,964
Are you fucking kidding me?

1729
01:30:21,966 --> 01:30:22,965
Are you fucking kidding me?!

1730
01:30:22,967 --> 01:30:25,143
We didn't have sex, okay?!

1731
01:30:31,236 --> 01:30:33,540
What did you do?

1732
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:35,325
We made out.

1733
01:30:35,327 --> 01:30:36,892
And he fingered me
a little bit, but...

1734
01:30:36,894 --> 01:30:38,154
Oh, my...

1735
01:30:38,156 --> 01:30:38,896
Nicole.

1736
01:30:46,164 --> 01:30:47,774
Congratulations.

1737
01:30:50,168 --> 01:30:52,559
Here is your reward
for being the most

1738
01:30:52,561 --> 01:30:55,519
selfish cunt in the universe!

1739
01:30:55,521 --> 01:30:57,347
Oh, I'm selfish?

1740
01:30:57,349 --> 01:30:58,261
Yeah.

1741
01:30:58,263 --> 01:30:59,915
Yeah you are.

1742
01:30:59,917 --> 01:31:03,266
Wow, you might be
an actual human being.

1743
01:31:03,268 --> 01:31:06,617
I never knew you were
capable of feeling emotions.

1744
01:31:06,619 --> 01:31:10,012
I don't like to tell
you how I'm feeling

1745
01:31:10,014 --> 01:31:12,405
because I don't
want to burden you

1746
01:31:12,407 --> 01:31:15,060
with the dark and
depressing shit

1747
01:31:15,062 --> 01:31:17,280
that runs through
my mind all day!

1748
01:31:17,282 --> 01:31:20,936
But you don't have a problem
unloading, do you, Rachel?

1749
01:31:20,938 --> 01:31:22,502
Oh, burden me?

1750
01:31:22,504 --> 01:31:25,636
You're the one that is so
fucking wrapped up in your own

1751
01:31:25,638 --> 01:31:29,858
world that you can't even
see how badly you've hurt me.

1752
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,557
How did I hurt you?

1753
01:31:33,776 --> 01:31:36,952
Not everyone is
like you, Nicole.

1754
01:31:36,954 --> 01:31:39,084
You go from one guy to the next,

1755
01:31:39,086 --> 01:31:42,522
and you take what you
can get and disappear.

1756
01:31:42,524 --> 01:31:45,569
You can't just go around doing
whatever the hell you want

1757
01:31:45,571 --> 01:31:48,267
and not expect
normal feeling people

1758
01:31:48,269 --> 01:31:49,965
to get emotionally involved.

1759
01:31:49,967 --> 01:31:50,750
How?!

1760
01:31:52,795 --> 01:31:54,232
How did I hurt you?

1761
01:31:55,973 --> 01:31:57,061
We had sex.

1762
01:31:58,758 --> 01:32:01,498
And then you go around pretending
like everything is fine

1763
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,760
- but it's not.
- No.

1764
01:32:02,762 --> 01:32:04,327
- And you know that.
- No, no, no!

1765
01:32:04,329 --> 01:32:07,373
We hooked up one
time when we were on drugs.

1766
01:32:07,375 --> 01:32:09,332
Oh, really, Nicole?

1767
01:32:09,334 --> 01:32:11,029
Was that it?

1768
01:32:11,031 --> 01:32:13,989
Because you seemed
very lucid at the time.

1769
01:32:13,991 --> 01:32:15,425
I'm not a dyke.

1770
01:32:15,427 --> 01:32:16,208
Neither are you.

1771
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:17,557
Oh, my God.

1772
01:32:17,559 --> 01:32:20,212
I am so fucking sick
of people telling me

1773
01:32:20,214 --> 01:32:22,475
who I am and what I want.

1774
01:32:22,477 --> 01:32:23,391
Bullshit!

1775
01:32:24,915 --> 01:32:28,003
Rachel Nolan, the
perpetual victim.

1776
01:32:28,005 --> 01:32:31,267
I'm not going to
fucking pity you, okay?

1777
01:32:31,269 --> 01:32:32,052
You,

1778
01:32:34,141 --> 01:32:35,664
you were very clear

1779
01:32:37,884 --> 01:32:40,234
on what you wanted that night.

1780
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:45,022
You practically
begged me for it.

1781
01:32:47,502 --> 01:32:50,505
And I just gave you
what you wanted.

1782
01:32:52,072 --> 01:32:56,903
So you can honestly say
that you didn't feel anything?

1783
01:33:00,341 --> 01:33:01,516
Not a thing.

1784
01:33:07,435 --> 01:33:11,524
You're above it all,
aren't you, Nicole?

1785
01:33:11,526 --> 01:33:15,139
Maybe you didn't feel
anything, but I did.

1786
01:33:17,968 --> 01:33:20,231
I was really fucked up, okay.

1787
01:33:21,841 --> 01:33:25,976
I didn't know if I was in
love with my best friend.

1788
01:33:28,761 --> 01:33:31,109
But I know I was alone,

1789
01:33:31,111 --> 01:33:35,766
and you were conveniently
absent when things got weird.

1790
01:33:35,768 --> 01:33:37,683
That fucking killed me.

1791
01:33:39,641 --> 01:33:40,858
So what did I do?

1792
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:44,209
I did something stupid,
and it was wrong,

1793
01:33:44,211 --> 01:33:46,997
and I was wrong
and I am so sorry.

1794
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:56,006
It's just I wanted
you to feel something.

1795
01:33:58,008 --> 01:34:00,488
I wanted you to feel how I felt.

1796
01:34:02,055 --> 01:34:04,229
Because I was hurt and I wanted,

1797
01:34:04,231 --> 01:34:06,190
I wanted you to hurt.

1798
01:34:07,887 --> 01:34:10,672
I have nobody to
blame but myself.

1799
01:34:18,245 --> 01:34:19,029
I am so

1800
01:34:25,296 --> 01:34:26,079
glad

1801
01:34:29,213 --> 01:34:30,083
that you've

1802
01:34:32,259 --> 01:34:34,044
reached enlightenment,

1803
01:34:36,829 --> 01:34:38,831
but I can't forgive you.

1804
01:34:41,138 --> 01:34:42,224
Nicole, please.

1805
01:34:42,226 --> 01:34:43,227
Don't.

1806
01:35:05,858 --> 01:35:08,250
Nicole, may I please
have you autograph?

1807
01:35:08,252 --> 01:35:09,122
Sure thing.

1808
01:35:11,907 --> 01:35:13,124
Big night tonight, huh?

1809
01:35:13,126 --> 01:35:14,386
Yep, you coming?

1810
01:35:14,388 --> 01:35:15,692
I'll definitely
try to make it.

1811
01:35:15,694 --> 01:35:16,910
Cool, see you later.

1812
01:35:16,912 --> 01:35:17,694
Yeah.

1813
01:35:17,696 --> 01:35:18,610
Absolutely.

1814
01:35:19,698 --> 01:35:20,481
Naomi.

1815
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,483
Yes, that
sounds great, Judy.

1816
01:35:24,485 --> 01:35:26,050
Yes, alright.

1817
01:35:26,052 --> 01:35:27,269
Thank you, Charles.

1818
01:35:27,271 --> 01:35:28,531
We're all very
pleased over here.

1819
01:35:28,533 --> 01:35:30,098
As are we.

1820
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:31,011
Yeah, bye bye.

1821
01:35:31,013 --> 01:35:33,146
Good bye Judy, thank you.

1822
01:35:38,151 --> 01:35:39,370
How does it feel?

1823
01:35:43,025 --> 01:35:44,331
I don't know.

1824
01:35:45,332 --> 01:35:48,638
I guess it hasn't
really hit me yet.

1825
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:51,556
Thank you, Charles,
for everything.

1826
01:35:52,687 --> 01:35:54,167
You've earned it.

1827
01:36:04,221 --> 01:36:05,698
Hey, sorry I'm late.

1828
01:36:05,700 --> 01:36:08,875
Hey, don't worry about it.

1829
01:36:08,877 --> 01:36:09,704
So?

1830
01:36:11,402 --> 01:36:13,141
I sign the papers on Monday.

1831
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:14,272
Yes!

1832
01:36:14,274 --> 01:36:15,882
Yes.

1833
01:36:15,884 --> 01:36:17,449
Oh, I'm taking you out
this weekend to celebrate.

1834
01:36:17,451 --> 01:36:18,887
Yeah, you are.

1835
01:36:19,932 --> 01:36:21,975
Will Emily be joining us?

1836
01:36:21,977 --> 01:36:22,761
Ah, no.

1837
01:36:23,588 --> 01:36:25,240
Ah, lady-killer?

1838
01:36:25,242 --> 01:36:27,459
On to the next one, huh?

1839
01:36:27,461 --> 01:36:31,248
I think I'm going to
date myself for awhile.

1840
01:36:34,251 --> 01:36:35,165
That's good.

1841
01:36:36,688 --> 01:36:39,125
So, are you going tonight?

1842
01:36:40,213 --> 01:36:41,386
Maybe.

1843
01:36:41,388 --> 01:36:42,172
Are you?

1844
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:44,476
No.

1845
01:36:44,478 --> 01:36:47,262
She doesn't want me there.

1846
01:36:47,264 --> 01:36:48,830
I think she would.

1847
01:38:07,692 --> 01:38:12,697
I had set ablaze
the bridge we built in our bed.

1848
01:38:13,915 --> 01:38:16,351
A path once easily
crossed was rendered

1849
01:38:16,353 --> 01:38:19,310
crumbling charred remains.

1850
01:38:19,312 --> 01:38:23,795
But fire is an instrument
of change, of purification.

1851
01:38:25,144 --> 01:38:26,970
I'll miss her.

1852
01:38:26,972 --> 01:38:27,755
Always.

1853
01:38:28,582 --> 01:38:31,017
But when one chapter ends,

1854
01:38:31,019 --> 01:38:32,369
another can begin.

1855
01:38:35,027 --> 01:38:38,373
