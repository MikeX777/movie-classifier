I don't have to be seen with you.

180
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:33,938
In other words, I've got work to do.

181
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:35,092
Hi, Blimpy.

182
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:36,322
Hey, you all.

183
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,819
Sorry. We're leaving.

184
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:40,355
I've got a dinner date with
some important people.

185
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:42,856
Mr and Mrs Peabody Pennington.

186
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:44,655
Can I cadge a lift to New York?

187
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:46,716
Blimpy, we're on our
way to the South Seas.

188
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:47,913
The South Seas?

189
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:50,115
Where there are no women.
- No women?

190
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:51,102
No women.

191
00:09:51,314 --> 00:09:52,701
Stags at bay. No women.

192
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:57,236
Women.

193
00:09:57,884 --> 00:09:59,159
What are we waiting for?

194
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:08,583
College boys.

195
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:13,015
You mean Kingsford glamour boys.

196
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:23,254
How many, gentlemen?
- Ten dollars' worth please.

197
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:33,409
Some native instinct tells me
we're short five apiece.

198
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:36,334
I'm sorry. I thought you were cockeyed.

199
00:10:40,877 --> 00:10:42,437
The lady said we were cockeyed.

200
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:44,109
The lady is no lady.

201
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:50,437
They're beautiful.

202
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:55,633
The good ones must be playing bridge.

203
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:02,976
Oh boy.

204
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,863
Look at that chestnut filly.

205
00:11:05,268 --> 00:11:06,262
Columbus.

206
00:11:07,004 --> 00:11:08,571
Columbus, Ohio.

207
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:23,081
Excuse me, Greg.

208
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:24,876
Phil, you can't cut in here.

209
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,654
Hey, you. That's my dame.

210
00:11:33,992 --> 00:11:35,784
You don't understand. This is my mother.

211
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:39,005
Okay, buddy.

212
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:45,811
Come on, featherfeet.
She's not your type.

213
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:46,911
Yeah. But ..

214
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,352
You know, there is such a thing
as manners even at the Joylane.

215
00:11:52,564 --> 00:11:53,921
Now that's gratitude.

216
00:11:54,165 --> 00:11:56,463
After I saved you from
that seagoing Tarzan.

217
00:11:56,821 --> 00:11:58,018
Maybe I like sailors.

218
00:11:58,491 --> 00:11:59,670
Do you want to dance?

219
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:05,365
Look. How long am I the
luckiest man at the Joylane?

220
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:07,565
You mean, how long
will these tickets last?

221
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:09,287
Oh .. two hours.

222
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:11,315
Except we close in twenty minutes.

223
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:13,223
That's great. Then we can do the town.

224
00:12:13,435 --> 00:12:14,998
No. Not a chance. I'm going home.

225
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,292
Really, I mean it.

226
00:12:16,539 --> 00:12:18,735
As a matter of fact, you
are quite a likely wench.

227
00:12:19,701 --> 00:12:20,452
Wench?

228
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,985
What do you think you're
buying, livestock?

229
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,274
Wait a minute. I didn't mean ..

230
00:12:25,547 --> 00:12:28,645
You guys come here with a little higher
education and a few dance tickets ..

231
00:12:28,857 --> 00:12:30,262
And think you own the joint.

232
00:12:30,635 --> 00:12:33,146
Suppose I don't think you look
like anybody's ball of fire?

233
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:36,273
Do I get a silly grin on my face
and start calling you names?

234
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,737
I just said you were a likely wench.

235
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,333
Maybe I just didn't like
the way you looked.

236
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:46,250
Boy.

237
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,223
You don't have that red hair
for nothing do you, Miss ..?

238
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:52,733
Miss ..?
- Thomas.

239
00:12:52,962 --> 00:12:53,995
Jane Thomas.

240
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,680
You know, these Broadway cowboys think
that the other name for Miss is 'Toots'.

241
00:12:58,357 --> 00:12:59,892
Frankly, you do look like a 'Toots'.

242
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:01,999
In a nice way I mean. Now, come on.

243
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:06,296
I guess it wasn't so smart
to wear these shoes.

244
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,231
Crepe soles. You can't dance in them.

245
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:10,450
I'll take them off.

246
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,335
Okay, jitterbug.
You can't dance like that.

247
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,129
It's better with the shoes off.

248
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,293
Listen, buddy.

249
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,686
Put them violins back in their cases.

250
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:35,486
My good man.

251
00:13:35,818 --> 00:13:38,306
Do you realize I am
Philip Griswold the third?

252
00:13:39,123 --> 00:13:41,024
I don't care if you're
Philip the sixteenth.

253
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:42,578
Put on them shoes.

254
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:46,398
Is there an official notice on any
fixture in these premises ..

255
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,223
Which says a gentleman may
not remove his shoes?

256
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,342
No. But I ..
- See? It is typical.

257
00:13:52,777 --> 00:13:54,181
You know what it is, don't you?

258
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:55,653
It's un-American.

259
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:57,832
It's a plot against the upper classes.

260
00:13:58,237 --> 00:13:59,480
But this ain't no plot.

261
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,601
Four score and seven years ago our
fathers fought and died for liberty ..

262
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:05,670
Freedom of speech and
freedom of worship.

263
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,184
They gave their blood
for the constitution.

264
00:14:08,497 --> 00:14:10,589
Which guarantees to every
American citizen ..

265
00:14:10,801 --> 00:14:14,372
A complete franchise, regardless
of race, color, creed or previous ..

266
00:14:15,302 --> 00:14:16,766
Previous .. previous ..

267
00:14:17,048 --> 00:14:18,798
Previous condition of servitude.

268
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:20,858
The very words. Thank you, my friend.

269
00:14:21,466 --> 00:14:24,208
Yeah, I know but I didn't hear ..
- Reading the constitution ..

270
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:26,828
That glorious document
which makes it a crime ..

271
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:29,384
To invade the inalienable
rights of the private citizen.

272
00:14:29,596 --> 00:14:32,019
Yeah. I know.
- The word for that is 'Treason'.

273
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,473
They get life for treason.

274
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:39,882
You can't do that in here.

275
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:42,149
We too are American citizens.

276
00:14:43,464 --> 00:14:44,319
My friends.

277
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,698
The dancing will continue.

278
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:52,875
Now I have seen everything.

279
00:14:54,945 --> 00:14:57,456
As a matter of fact, the best dancing
in the world is done barefoot.

280
00:14:57,668 --> 00:14:59,363
Look at the Hawaiians and the dryads.

281
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,281
Cut the double talk.
That isn't why you took your shoes off.

282
00:15:02,532 --> 00:15:03,486
No?
- No.

283
00:15:03,898 --> 00:15:05,303
You just did it to show off.

284
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:06,896
Oh.

285
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,493
Hey, wait a minute, sailor.

286
00:15:16,803 --> 00:15:18,756
I'm dancing with the dame.
- Let go of her.

287
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:20,861
I said <i>I am</i> dancing with the dame.

288
00:15:21,831 --> 00:15:22,719
You big lug!

289
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,143
Hey.

290
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:27,745
What's the matter?

291
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:29,222
Hey.

292
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:36,594
Come on.

293
00:15:36,822 --> 00:15:37,671
Come on.

294
00:15:43,647 --> 00:15:44,729
You can't do that.

295
00:15:45,122 --> 00:15:46,123
Wait a minute.

296
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:54,625
My gosh. You got hurt?

297
00:15:55,642 --> 00:15:56,304
Hurt?

298
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:58,278
No, no. Let me at those guys.

299
00:15:58,659 --> 00:15:59,771
You'd better go home.

300
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:02,796
I don't want to go home.
- You said you'd take me home.

301
00:16:04,055 --> 00:16:04,759
I did?

302
00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:07,872
Well, okay.

303
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:09,205
Sure.

304
00:16:09,627 --> 00:16:10,935
The pleasure is all mine.

305
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,149
Does it hurt very much?
- Hurt? No.

306
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:17,129
You mean this?

307
00:16:17,734 --> 00:16:20,245
I didn't get this in a fight.
I got it falling downstairs.

308
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:21,874
The bunch of lugs.

309
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:23,297
Toe crushers.

310
00:16:24,223 --> 00:16:25,584
You laugh. I am serious.

311
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:29,680
There's no romance left in
anything anymore. Even a brawl.

312
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:31,844
That's the trouble with modern life.

313
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,699
When I graduate from college
I'm getting out of it.

314
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:36,078
Out of modern life?

315
00:16:36,523 --> 00:16:37,411
All the way.

316
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,627
There used to be adventure
and excitement.

317
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,179
There used to be pioneers.

318
00:16:41,773 --> 00:16:43,016
You take my own father.

319
00:16:43,358 --> 00:16:46,875
Now, everybody thinks he's always
been the Gibraltar of Wall Street.

320
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,679
You know what he did?

321
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:50,510
Back in 1902, he ..

322
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:52,212
Cornered the wheat market.

323
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:53,861
Without a dime in his pocket.

324
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:56,213
A great guy, my old man.

325
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:58,509
But me?

326
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,475
Nothing ever happens to me.

327
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,095
Nothing but security.

328
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:05,002
No, sir. I'm leaving this ..

329
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:08,230
Glittering, inarticulate,
so-called civilization.

330
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:11,383
I'll take some sort of a
place in Bali or Tahiti.

331
00:17:12,142 --> 00:17:12,804
Then.

332
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:15,853
If I don't drink myself to
death .. I may even write.

333
00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:19,008
You know, I think that
is perfectly wonderful.

334
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:21,988
You're right.

335
00:17:22,529 --> 00:17:24,031
You're a very intelligent girl.

336
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:26,850
No girl can figure out things like ..

337
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,638
Like a man.

338
00:17:29,742 --> 00:17:31,534
You know, I would like to see you again.

339
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:33,896
That's awfully sweet of you.

340
00:17:34,712 --> 00:17:36,181
How about next Saturday night?

341
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:39,022
No, no. Not next Saturday.
That is house parties.

342
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:40,729
House parties?

343
00:17:40,963 --> 00:17:42,389
Sure. Kingsford house parties.

344
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:44,717
Every club has a dance from
Friday until wrecked.

345
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:47,191
Wonderful.

346
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:49,943
You know. I haven't
danced for six months.

347
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:51,623
You what?

348
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,298
I mean, danced and liked it.

349
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,000
Except with you tonight.

350
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:59,184
Look. Why don't you come
down next weekend?

351
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:00,985
To Kingsford?

352
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,671
But I couldn't do that.
- Sure you can.

353
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,514
Come on down. We'll have fun.

354
00:18:07,077 --> 00:18:08,668
Do you really mean it?
- Absolutely.

355
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,072
Just take the Kingsford Special on
Friday afternoon and there you are.

356
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:24,200
Goodnight.

357
00:18:24,882 --> 00:18:25,848
Goodnight.

358
00:18:29,313 --> 00:18:30,882
I have a room-mate, you know.

359
00:18:31,164 --> 00:18:33,915
A swell idea. No girl should
live alone these days.

360
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:39,819
Goodnight.

361
00:18:40,824 --> 00:18:42,164
See you down at Kingsford.

362
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:44,392
Goodnight .. Phil.

363
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:47,294
Here.

364
00:18:47,963 --> 00:18:49,624
Friend. Dream about flowers.

365
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:00,450
Life is full of
disappointments, eh buddy?

366
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,305
I'll drive. You don't know
where we're going.

367
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,581
Gee, you got here quick.
- On my own nickel too.

368
00:19:12,962 --> 00:19:14,655
Mavis, how much money have you got?

369
00:19:14,994 --> 00:19:16,598
Nine dollars and 63 cents.

370
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,284
The landlady already put in her bid.

371
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:20,991
I have fourteen. Let's see.

372
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,157
A suit and hair costs
sixteen dollars and ..

373
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:26,685
And five bucks down on a formal.
- What are you buying, a trousseau?

374
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:29,115
Remember that college
boy I was dancing with?

375
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,880
The barefoot Romeo?

376
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:34,422
Would it interest you to know
that is Philip Griswold?

377
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:35,846
Philip Griswold?

378
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:37,894
Philip Griswold?

379
00:19:38,313 --> 00:19:41,118
Hmm. He invited me down to
Kingsford to a prom next weekend.

380
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:42,263
Honey.

381
00:19:42,627 --> 00:19:46,006
Why don't you just find a nice, safe
buzz-saw to stick your head in?

382
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:48,472
But he's a gentleman. The real McCoy.

383
00:19:49,962 --> 00:19:50,624
Gosh.

384
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,098
He didn't even make
a pass at me in the taxi.

385
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,044
That's just the new technique.

386
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:58,760
So you must lead them by the hand before
they have you scaling the wallpaper.

387
00:19:59,141 --> 00:20:00,256
I'm going anyway.

388
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:03,968
Miss Thomas, you certainly hit
the low bar since you left Kansas.

389
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:06,599
Your name was going to
be up in electric lights.

390
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:09,375
Now you're going to settle
for a social register.

391
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,964
Honey, you don't belong with that crowd.

392
00:20:12,397 --> 00:20:15,356
And why not? If you're born in a
stable does that make you a horse?

393
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:17,960
After all, this is America in 1939.

394
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:21,325
If you think I'll let a dream prince
ride right out of the picture ..

395
00:20:21,537 --> 00:20:23,359
Just because I'm
temporarily at the Joylane.

396
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:24,908
Okay, Cinderella.

397
00:20:25,305 --> 00:20:27,225
But don't say I didn't warn you.

398
00:20:34,212 --> 00:20:35,364
Dream about flowers.

399
00:20:48,528 --> 00:20:49,746
Hey, there is Mary Rose.

400
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,815
I thought you were
stagging this weekend.

401
00:20:52,454 --> 00:20:55,541
Mrs Wilston got hold of me and we
split a couple of pints of tea and ..

402
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:58,208
Here is Mary Rose.
- I see.

403
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,201
Carol.

404
00:20:59,923 --> 00:21:00,617
Carol.

405
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:01,641
Phil.

406
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:05,328
You look like a fur-trapper's moll.
- I trapped these myself.

407
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:08,166
Are you glad to see me?
- Last weekend was a desert.

408
00:21:08,556 --> 00:21:10,092
Homer. Here I am, darling.

409
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,598
Hello, Ann.

410
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:16,704
Hello Greg.

411
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,106
Hello everybody.

412
00:21:21,325 --> 00:21:22,912
Hey, what's this all about?

413
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,323
You mean you're dating all three of us?

414
00:21:25,665 --> 00:21:27,231
Yeah. A sort-of triple-cross, eh?

415
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:28,690
Well, honestly.

416
00:21:29,132 --> 00:21:31,441
I thought men always compared
notes about these things.

417
00:21:34,542 --> 00:21:36,110
I guess we had better grab these.

418
00:21:38,892 --> 00:21:42,041
I told you, Miss. The other young ladies
are way up there in the special Pullman.

419
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:44,945
That is alright.
I prefer the day coaches.

420
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,377
Thank you.

421
00:21:50,697 --> 00:21:52,709
Hey, wait. I left my
hat-box on the train.

422
00:21:52,957 --> 00:21:55,363
Blimpy, will you please get
it for me? It's white pigskin.

423
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,189
Blimpy, the car's full of luggage.

424
00:21:57,509 --> 00:21:58,817
You'd better grab a taxi.

425
00:22:03,808 --> 00:22:05,573
Now I got a date with a hat-box.

426
00:22:14,173 --> 00:22:14,996
Excuse me.

427
00:22:16,455 --> 00:22:17,795
Do you know Phil Griswold?

428
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:20,157
Sure. He's one of my best friends.

429
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:21,937
But he just left.

430
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:24,606
I got off at the wrong end of the train.

431
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,584
I guess he didn't think I was coming.

432
00:22:26,796 --> 00:22:28,547
Suppose I take you to his room?

433
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:30,996
I'm going there.
- Are you?

434
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:32,205
Thanks.

435
00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:34,141
Didn't you have a date?

436
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,275
Yeah. But I was left holding the bag.

437
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:45,001
<i>If you knew Suzy like I know Suzy</i> ..

438
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,055
<i>Oh what a girl</i>.

439
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:51,488
<i>There is none so classy</i>.

440
00:22:51,841 --> 00:22:53,223
<i>As this fair lassie</i>.

441
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:55,952
Greg.
- Go away.

442
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,555
Greg. Excuse me a minute.

443
00:23:00,064 --> 00:23:02,422
Does that redhead ring a
gong in your subconscious?

444
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,487
Echoes of the Joylane.

445
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:11,035
That babe Phil took home.

446
00:23:11,711 --> 00:23:14,664
And a plague was visited
on the house of Griswold.

447
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,830
Have you a cigarette?
- Yeah. Yeah.

448
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:24,008
Really, I don't think I can make it.

449
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:26,189
We still have each other.

450
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,890
Well, here comes our host.

451
00:23:30,459 --> 00:23:32,801
Does anybody want anything?
- Yeah. Hedy Lamarr.

452
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:42,142
Private stock.

453
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:44,423
Would you take this please?

454
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:47,506
Phil.

455
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,031
Are you addressing me?

456
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,083
Men's talk?

457
00:23:51,617 --> 00:23:52,832
That's alright, Blimpy.

458
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:54,643
Daphne, let's go dress for dinner.

459
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:57,742
Phil. Jane Thomas is here.

460
00:23:58,032 --> 00:23:59,275
Jane Thomas? Who's she?

461
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:01,113
She said she had a date with you.

462
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:02,277
Jane Thomas?

463
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,272
I never heard of her. Where is she?

464
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,151
I didn't bring her up here.

465
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:09,037
She's in your room.

466
00:24:11,763 --> 00:24:12,482
Okay.

467
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:14,314
Blimpy.
- Yep?

468
00:24:14,602 --> 00:24:16,800
Where did you get her?
- Who? You mean Jane Thomas?

469
00:24:17,137 --> 00:24:17,799
Sure.

470
00:24:18,046 --> 00:24:20,038
I picked her up down at the station.

471
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,793
He picked her up.
- He picked her up.

472
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,629
Say, don't you know who she is?
- No. Who is she?

473
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,028
Do you mean to tell me you haven't
heard of the Thomas's of Philadelphia?

474
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:30,413
Thomas's? Thomas's?

475
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:32,948
Of course. The Thomas's.

476
00:24:33,337 --> 00:24:34,623
A fine old family.

477
00:24:38,171 --> 00:24:39,019
Hello, Phil.

478
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:42,243
Well, hello.

479
00:24:45,189 --> 00:24:46,464
What are you doing here?

480
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:48,468
What am I ..

481
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:49,723
Wait a minute.

482
00:24:49,935 --> 00:24:51,275
Did I ask you down here?

483
00:24:52,943 --> 00:24:53,863
Yes, you did.

484
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,297
Oh.

485
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,311
Boy, I must have been tight.

486
00:24:58,181 --> 00:24:59,044
Miss ..?

487
00:25:00,227 --> 00:25:02,930
Miss Jane, I can't tell
you how sorry I am.

488
00:25:04,157 --> 00:25:05,432
Don't give it a thought.

489
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,498
I like train rides.

490
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:09,840
I wish I could do something
about it but ..

491
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:11,521
Of course I have another date.

492
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,832
This is the biggest thing of the year.
- Yes. You said that last week.

493
00:25:15,044 --> 00:25:15,867
Look here.

494
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:17,922
I wish you'd take this.

495
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,782
For your expenses.

496
00:25:20,788 --> 00:25:21,990
No, really. I mean it.

497
00:25:22,202 --> 00:25:23,817
After all, it was partly my fault.

498
00:25:24,913 --> 00:25:25,995
Partly your fault?

499
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:27,807
<i>Partly</i> your fault?

500
00:25:28,156 --> 00:25:29,215
You conceited ..

501
00:25:30,101 --> 00:25:32,393
I hope I'm not butting
in to something. Am I?

502
00:25:32,623 --> 00:25:33,921
Quite obviously, you are.

503
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,198
No, you aren't. I was just leaving.
- Leaving?

504
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:38,477
Miss Thomas, you can't do that.

505
00:25:38,785 --> 00:25:39,953
You just got here.

506
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:42,355
Look, Phil.

507
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:46,489
I couldn't help but notice the wires
have sort-of gotten crossed here.

508
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:49,479
I'm just the man that
can straighten them out.

509
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:50,968
Mighty white of you.

510
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:52,142
Miss Thomas.

511
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:55,268
Would you do me the honor
to be <i>my</i> date this weekend?

512
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,315
Miss Thomas is unable to stay.

513
00:25:59,052 --> 00:26:00,618
Blimpy, I'd love to be your date.

514
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:03,092
Swell. Come on, y'all.

515
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,111
Jane has to meet the gang.

516
00:26:05,702 --> 00:26:06,497
Let's go.

517
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:08,610
Don't be silly. You won't like it here.

518
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:10,390
Stick around and see.

519
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:14,193
Hey, y'all.

520
00:26:14,416 --> 00:26:16,989
Open the door.
I've got my date out here.

521
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,305
What do you mean, <i>your</i> date?

522
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:24,372
Introducing Miss Thomas.

523
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,215
Sold me down the river for a redhead.

524
00:26:32,474 --> 00:26:34,744
How do you do? I'm Daphne Graves.
- I know.

525
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,473
I see your pictures in the
press all the time and I ..

526
00:26:37,685 --> 00:26:38,411
You do?

527
00:26:41,595 --> 00:26:43,678
How do you do? I am Carol Christy.
- Hello.

528
00:26:44,113 --> 00:26:44,819
And.

529
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:46,987
This is Ann Van Reichton.

530
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,714
Hello.

531
00:26:48,949 --> 00:26:49,901
How do you do?

532
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,412
I guess you'll have to take
this bed by the door.

533
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:55,269
It seems to be the only one left.

534
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,012
And close the door, Miss Thomas.

535
00:26:57,224 --> 00:26:58,790
You can't tell what will blow in.

536
00:27:00,775 --> 00:27:01,857
Don't mind Daphne.

537
00:27:02,323 --> 00:27:05,172
She started with three men. Now she
only has one like an ordinary girl.

538
00:27:05,444 --> 00:27:06,630
Naturally, she's bitter.

539
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:09,695
I looked everywhere for Homer and
he's simply disappeared again.

540
00:27:14,202 --> 00:27:15,348
This is Miss Thomas.

541
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:16,891
Mary Rose Wilston.

542
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:18,079
Hello.

543
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:19,243
How do you do?

544
00:27:20,582 --> 00:27:22,568
I mean the way he keeps
getting away from me.

545
00:27:22,906 --> 00:27:25,963
Honestly, I don't see why he even
bothered to ask me down here.

546
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:28,363
Homer is the typical mad, zany type.

547
00:27:28,823 --> 00:27:30,242
You've got the wrong technique.

548
00:27:30,454 --> 00:27:32,713
You've got to play
the 'inspiration girl'.

549
00:27:33,046 --> 00:27:34,792
Make him give up
cigarettes and highballs.

550
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,305
Make him look up to you.

551
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:40,047
Have you any suggestions?

552
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:43,129
There's only one way to make
a college boy look up to you.

553
00:27:43,341 --> 00:27:44,929
Yes?
- Climb a ladder.

554
00:27:56,011 --> 00:27:57,351
They're going to sit here.

555
00:27:57,781 --> 00:28:01,566
This is Miss Jane Thomas.
In case any of you haven't met her yet.

556
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:03,306
Homer Ten Eyck.

557
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:04,890
How do you do, Miss Thomas?

558
00:28:05,285 --> 00:28:06,138
Greg Smith.

559
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,302
How do you do?

560
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,912
Skel Lorimer.

561
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:10,432
How are you, Miss Thomas?

562
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:15,397
She's quite a fire hazard.

563
00:28:15,808 --> 00:28:18,624
Where do you suppose Blimpy got her?
- The woods are full of that type.

564
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:20,495
Look what's coming.

565
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,495
Here we are.
I never get anywhere on time.

566
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:23,895
Hi, everybody.
- Hello.

567
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:26,297
Boy, has that Torgler
got himself a woman.

568
00:28:26,694 --> 00:28:30,216
It is Betty Ainsbridge.
The last of the 2-2-2 diviners.

569
00:28:30,461 --> 00:28:31,333
Hiya, Phil.

570
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:33,987
But honestly, doesn't everybody
look simply bright-eyed.

571
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,940
This is going to be a terrific brawl.

572
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:38,953
Poor Betty.

573
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,981
She doesn't know sincerity is back.

574
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:43,789
She must be twenty-three at least.

575
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,453
My dear, she is a hag.

576
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:46,688
A hag, huh?

577
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:49,796
Ha. In Europe they keep them
on ice until they are thirty.

578
00:28:50,241 --> 00:28:51,645
Blimpy. Who is she?

579
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:54,426
That is Betty Ainsbridge.

580
00:28:54,778 --> 00:28:57,719
She was an all-American prom
trotter when I was a freshman.

581
00:28:58,033 --> 00:28:59,070
Five years ago.

582
00:29:02,735 --> 00:29:04,322
Now everybody seems to be here.

583
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:09,307
I must say that we're all very grateful
for this invasion of charm and beauty.

584
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:12,571
We want to thank you for accepting
our humble hospitality.

585
00:29:13,217 --> 00:29:14,743
We hope that everybody ..

586
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:16,610
[ Coughing ]

587
00:29:17,243 --> 00:29:17,937
Shush.

588
00:29:19,052 --> 00:29:19,972
Listen to me.

589
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:22,135
I must think I am Camille or something.

590
00:29:22,842 --> 00:29:25,179
Honestly. Don't you all think
I'm terribly attractive?

591
00:29:29,663 --> 00:29:31,659
Kingsford is honored
to have you all here.

592
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:33,624
We hope you have a wonderful time.

593
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:39,606
Homer, don't you think
you smoke too much?

594
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:42,894
That's your third cigarette and you
haven't touched your fruit cocktail.

595
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:46,495
Say, what do you think I am?
A fugitive from a day nursery?

596
00:29:57,444 --> 00:29:58,214
Joe.

597
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:01,485
I'm so glad to see you. It's been ages.

598
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:04,479
How are you, Carol?

599
00:30:04,797 --> 00:30:05,866
Fine, thank you.

600
00:30:06,548 --> 00:30:07,436
How are you?

601
00:30:09,231 --> 00:30:10,374
I'm fine, Carol.

602
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:12,763
I am fine too.

603
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:16,327
You both look fine but I'm starving.

604
00:30:16,728 --> 00:30:18,982
Yes, Carol. Turn our
best provider loose.

605
00:30:21,483 --> 00:30:22,290
See you.

606
00:30:24,721 --> 00:30:27,511
Better look out, Phil.
Or the help will beat your time.

607
00:30:27,957 --> 00:30:30,201
Joe is not the help.
He is working his way.

608
00:30:30,517 --> 00:30:32,674
Well, that is one road to success.

609
00:30:33,754 --> 00:30:35,186
Don't you think so, Miss Thomas?

610
00:30:37,345 --> 00:30:40,511
Most of the boys back home worked
their way through college. If they go.

611
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:43,379
Did you come to New York to study?

612
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:45,474
Where did you go? Miss Carter's?

613
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:48,316
Miss Nottingham's?
- I went to Corn Falls high school.

614
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:50,336
Corn Falls? What's that?

615
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:52,868
It couldn't be a place. It's a gag.

616
00:30:53,422 --> 00:30:55,211
It's not a gag. It's where I come from.

617
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:58,028
Corn Falls, Kansas.
We've got a farm there.

618
00:30:58,873 --> 00:30:59,470
Oh?

619
00:31:00,054 --> 00:31:00,789
Kansas.

620
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:02,069
Kansas?

621
00:31:03,402 --> 00:31:05,604
I thought you were from Philadelphia.

622
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:08,586
Blimpy. How could you
ever have thought that?

623
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:13,760
Will you excuse me?

624
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:16,499
It must be the excitement or something.

625
00:31:17,212 --> 00:31:18,642
But all of a sudden, I ..

626
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:20,753
I have the most terrible headache.

627
00:31:21,052 --> 00:31:22,452
You certainly have.

628
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:33,961
Oh .. you dope.

629
00:31:35,113 --> 00:31:36,302
I am sorry, Daphne.

630
00:31:36,514 --> 00:31:38,682
It's only a little water.
- Only a little water?

631
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,625
Well. Goodbye, everybody.

632
00:31:41,408 --> 00:31:43,039
I'm going to put on a bathing suit.

633
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:47,324
Well.

634
00:31:48,037 --> 00:31:49,947
Kansas seems to be poison around here.

635
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,966
Oh no. It's just that
Blimpy is a southerner.

636
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,282
Naturally, things like background
and family are important to him.

637
00:32:07,265 --> 00:32:08,523
Well, sister rat.

638
00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:13,392
I'll go up and see if I can
square things with that girl.

639
00:32:13,604 --> 00:32:14,395
Go ahead.

640
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,791
I'm sorry you had an accident.

641
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:21,355
That was no accident.

642
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:29,495
What was supposed to say?
<i>Miss</i> Corn Falls high school?

643
00:32:32,676 --> 00:32:33,715
Okay. You win.

644
00:32:34,127 --> 00:32:36,217
Is that what you came up here for?
- No.

645
00:32:36,884 --> 00:32:39,581
After all. You know you don't just
get up and bolt during the soup.

646
00:32:39,815 --> 00:32:42,674
Listen. I'm in the wrong place.
But I don't feel like laughing about it.

647
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:44,947
I'm going home.
- Now, wait a minute, Jane.

648
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:46,790
I don't want you to feel like that.

649
00:32:47,026 --> 00:32:48,677
This whole setup is my fault.

650
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:50,908
I've been a heel and I
have put you in a spot.

651
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,852
If it's not too late,
I'd like to make up for it.

652
00:32:54,461 --> 00:32:55,702
I'm a taxi-dancer, see.

653
00:32:55,914 --> 00:32:58,381
I don't belong in your crowd
and from now on I'll know it.

654
00:32:58,654 --> 00:33:01,086
That whole business at dinner.
That shouldn't have happened.

655
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:03,142
It was only because you
were tied up with a ..

656
00:33:03,354 --> 00:33:04,791
Stuffed shirt like Blimpy.

657
00:33:05,175 --> 00:33:06,868
The others aren't like that.

658
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:10,925
Under that double talk they're okay.
If you knew them you'd like them.

659
00:33:12,118 --> 00:33:13,508
I like everybody, but ..

660
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:17,005
What do you expect me to do?
Wrestle them single-handed?

661
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:21,805
That crack about family and background
from that dumb Park Avenue squab.

662
00:33:22,573 --> 00:33:24,462
Sure. I guessed they
would be down on you.

663
00:33:24,729 --> 00:33:26,683
But it's only because
you're so much more ..

664
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,429
Well, it's pretty obvious.

665
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:29,838
But the rest?

666
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,208
Really, Red. You'll have a good time.
I'll underwrite it myself if you stay.

667
00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:36,724
I wouldn't stay here now
even if I liked the joint.

668
00:33:37,663 --> 00:33:40,238
From now on my dancing
will be done at the Joylane.

669
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,645
Besides, you've a date with Carol.
- Only one of my dates.

670
00:33:45,287 --> 00:33:47,150
Look. The dances start
in just a little while.

671
00:33:47,362 --> 00:33:49,895
Now, you build yourself a new
face along the same lines.

672
00:33:50,274 --> 00:33:51,711
I'm walking out of your life.

673
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,060
But I'll be back in ten minutes.
- Phil, please.

674
00:34:11,907 --> 00:34:13,299
Hello there.
- Hello.

675
00:34:13,932 --> 00:34:15,872
If it isn't one thing it's ten others.

676
00:34:16,177 --> 00:34:17,499
In the middle of the salad.

677
00:34:17,711 --> 00:34:20,277
I have to come whooping upstairs
to put on an evening gown.

678
00:34:20,664 --> 00:34:22,001
And I adore salad.

679
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:23,905
You did better than I did at that.

680
00:34:24,291 --> 00:34:25,631
Don't you adore Kingsford?

681
00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:27,251
I'm nuts about it.

682
00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:29,389
There's simply no other school like it.

683
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,149
There's parties. There is men.

684
00:34:31,477 --> 00:34:33,465
You know, I was practically
raised here myself.

685
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,954
Is it true this is your fifth
year at house parties?

686
00:34:37,772 --> 00:34:38,854
Who told you that?

687
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:40,614
I don't know.

688
00:34:41,152 --> 00:34:42,857
Somebody said you'd been here a lot.

689
00:34:44,922 --> 00:34:45,713
Honestly.

690
00:34:45,993 --> 00:34:48,571
If a person gets seen more than
twice around here you are ..

691
00:34:48,998 --> 00:34:50,862
You'd think she was
folklore or something.

692
00:34:51,737 --> 00:34:54,689
Is it fun to keep doing this
college stuff over and over?

693
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:59,187
It's surely a lot more fun than haunting
the late spots on East 52nd Street.

694
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:02,699
With a lot of dull-witted people who
think they'll be powers in Wall Street.

695
00:35:03,108 --> 00:35:05,133
Give me a college man every time.

696
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:20,353
It's just beautiful, isn't it?

697
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,125
We spent next year's treasury
jazzing it up for you girls.

698
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,062
Which one do you think you'd like?

699
00:35:27,274 --> 00:35:28,919
The Scribe. That's Lenny Goodwood.

700
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,869
Lyons is the chain store prince.

701
00:35:31,317 --> 00:35:32,528
Been here seven years.

702
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,959
Laurel has the best punch.
I think we'll take Laurel.

703
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:38,455
Is that where all your friends are?

704
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:41,880
Wait a minute, Kansas. You're not
still scared of the glamour girl?

705
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:44,719
A woman whose grandpa
fought the Indians?

706
00:35:45,487 --> 00:35:47,601
Okay, but I'd rather take the Indians.

707
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,050
<i>Loveliness</i>.

708
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:53,535
<i>You are all the heaven I have seen</i>.

709
00:35:55,011 --> 00:35:56,537
<i>Loveliness</i>.

710
00:35:57,241 --> 00:36:00,080
<i>You would make an orchid turn green</i>.

711
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:03,583
<i>Your charm and such are far too much</i>.

712
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:06,012
<i>To really please</i>.

713
00:36:06,935 --> 00:36:09,867
<i>Of all that stuff, quite enough</i>.

714
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:15,163
<i>Loveliness</i>.

715
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,575
Come on, Kansas.
Everything is going to be alright.

716
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:24,312
<i>Just Like some subtle perfume</i>.

717
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:29,767
Say. Phil has really got
something there, hasn't he.

718
00:36:30,426 --> 00:36:32,929
I think it was nice of Phil to
bring that girl to the dances.

719
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,284
How did you ever make him do it, Carol?

720
00:36:35,606 --> 00:36:37,818
Nobody ever has to make
Phil act like a human being.

721
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:39,877
Daphne wouldn't know about that.

722
00:36:40,774 --> 00:36:42,057
Tap-tap, old boy.

723
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:48,452
Blimpy, how is your headache?

724
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,784
Can I cut in?

725
00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:55,043
Why sure.

726
00:36:57,568 --> 00:37:00,261
You now dance with one of the top
ranked dancers of the civilized world.

727
00:37:00,473 --> 00:37:01,497
Including Omaha.

728
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:04,374
I would have heard about you if
you were the best dancer in Omaha.

729
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:58,846
Phil, you sure are a
connoisseur of women.

730
00:37:59,955 --> 00:38:01,360
The line forms on the right.

731
00:38:01,995 --> 00:38:03,725
And have your tickets ready, boys.

732
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:30,710
Take a bow, swing-ma'am.
You were terrific.

733
00:38:34,009 --> 00:38:34,671
Jane.

734
00:38:35,361 --> 00:38:38,018
Now show us how you do it
at the Joylane dance hall.

735
00:38:45,194 --> 00:38:47,213
The Joylane is old stuff
for the boys, Daphne.

736
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:50,358
But now everybody knows
I'm a professional.

737
00:38:51,172 --> 00:38:53,094
It's going to cost the
boys a dime a dance.

738
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:57,571
I want 23 dollars and
forty cents' worth.

739
00:38:58,651 --> 00:38:59,791
Cut in.
- But boys ..

740
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:00,729
Cut in.

741
00:39:01,074 --> 00:39:02,911
Miss Thomas. We have a nickel.

742
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,997
In the words of the prophet:

743
00:39:08,209 --> 00:39:10,389
'Be kind, sweet maid.
And let who will, be clever'.

744
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,928
Can you imagine? A taxi dancer.

745
00:39:13,422 --> 00:39:14,975
Blimpy must have been mad.

746
00:39:15,536 --> 00:39:16,811
Let's get this straight.

747
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:19,579
Jane came down here
because I invited her.

748
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:20,976
Last Saturday night.

749
00:39:21,296 --> 00:39:22,581
The night you had to study?

750
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,553
But you invited Carol for this weekend.

751
00:39:25,225 --> 00:39:27,954
I mean, did you think you were going
to have two dates or something?

752
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:29,687
Why not?

753
00:39:30,861 --> 00:39:33,542
Everyone knows the Griswolds
aren't in the run of average men.

754
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,020
This was ours, Joe.

755
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,877
That was swell of you, Carol.

756
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:45,862
Phil, your date is simply a sensation.

757
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:48,994
That redhead, I mean.
- Yeah. Jane.

758
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:55,506
Cut in please.

759
00:39:59,220 --> 00:39:59,914
May I?

760
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,012
You know there's no
cutting after midnight.

761
00:40:02,224 --> 00:40:03,661
When did that go into effect?

762
00:40:05,672 --> 00:40:07,365
Isn't Phil frantically modern.

763
00:40:07,754 --> 00:40:08,416
Yeah.

764
00:40:09,646 --> 00:40:11,501
Now, Homer. That's your sixth drink.

765
00:40:11,755 --> 00:40:12,772
It's my seventh.

766
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:15,037
Darling, you know how you get.

767
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:19,193
Tommy, don't you think it's advanced
for a man to have two dates at a party?

768
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,927
I certainly do.

769
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,896
You'll be sorry for that,
Homer Ten Eyck.

770
00:40:25,324 --> 00:40:26,341
Give me another.

771
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:31,303
Homer and Mary Rose act so
domestic it's positively frightening.

772
00:40:32,115 --> 00:40:32,781
Yes.

773
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:34,099
Frightening.

774
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:39,249
I was so glad to see you when
you came in to dinner tonight.

775
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:42,157
I've looked for you every time
I came down to Kingsford.

776
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:44,612
At football games and
at the junior prom.

777
00:40:46,062 --> 00:40:47,897
You don't go to many dances, do you?

778
00:40:49,252 --> 00:40:51,087
I've been pretty busy working.

779
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:54,652
Then we do have to study
here once in a while.

780
00:40:55,635 --> 00:40:58,654
How did you manage to come out tonight
with finals coming up and everything?

781
00:40:59,552 --> 00:41:01,247
I've grown up since last fall, Carol.

782
00:41:02,795 --> 00:41:04,781
You didn't used to ask
what you already knew.

783
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:14,033
I haven't learned to rumba yet.

784
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,532
It's a nice night.

785
00:41:20,114 --> 00:41:21,648
I love spring here at Kingsford.

786
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,493
Joe, look who's here.

787
00:41:36,234 --> 00:41:37,793
Yeah, I know. Jupiter.

788
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,045
I have seen him every night.

789
00:41:40,745 --> 00:41:43,345
You remember that first night we
picked him out down at Montauk?

790
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:46,969
Sure. I remember.

791
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:51,691
And here he is at Kingsford.
Two hundred miles away.

792
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,358
Oh.

793
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:55,739
Sure.

794
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:57,694
Distance means nothing these days.

795
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:04,584
Carol.

796
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,647
Phil didn't know that girl
was coming down here.

797
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,878
He was off on a binge.
He forgot all about it.

798
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,756
That's alright. It doesn't matter.

799
00:42:11,968 --> 00:42:13,825
He'd never put you on
the spot like that.

800
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:17,195
You know how it is when a fellow ..
- You're so nice to apologise for Phil.

801
00:42:17,957 --> 00:42:19,846
But don't you see?
It just doesn't matter.

802
00:42:21,647 --> 00:42:22,341
You ..

803
00:42:23,562 --> 00:42:25,257
You mean you're not in love with him?

804
00:42:28,238 --> 00:42:30,252
Joe. It's simply wonderful
being with Phil.

805
00:42:31,474 --> 00:42:33,363
You know, we practically
grew up together.

806
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,162
We know all the same people.
We like to do all the same things.

807
00:42:36,476 --> 00:42:38,014
You mean you both like yachts.

808
00:42:39,649 --> 00:42:42,381
Well, I think people
have to face things.

809
00:42:43,657 --> 00:42:45,256
I know what kind of a person I am.

810
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:47,987
Houses and clothes and trips.

811
00:42:48,453 --> 00:42:49,082
Fun.

812
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:50,887
They're what I want.

813
00:42:52,294 --> 00:42:54,551
So does Phil.
So we're just bound to be happy.

814
00:42:57,169 --> 00:42:57,895
I mean.

815
00:42:59,773 --> 00:43:02,559
Well, everything isn't just
simple like it used to be.

816
00:43:05,326 --> 00:43:07,696
Life is so complicated these days.

817
00:43:08,189 --> 00:43:11,110
Life isn't complicated Carol
if two people love each other.

818
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:12,766
All my life I've heard that.

819
00:43:12,998 --> 00:43:15,412
About sacrifices and struggles
and unselfishness.

820
00:43:16,214 --> 00:43:17,166
It isn't true.

821
00:43:17,617 --> 00:43:20,605
The happy people are the ones who get
things. Not the ones who give them up.

822
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:26,295
Joe. I guess it's just
that I see too far ahead.

823
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:28,957
Sure. Too far ahead and
nothing in between.

824
00:43:30,248 --> 00:43:31,006
Alright.

825
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:34,283
If it's 'things' you want, I guess you
just have to go ahead and get them.

826
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:35,738
To find out you didn't.

827
00:43:36,015 --> 00:43:38,551
You're just being young again.
Just like you were last summer.

828
00:43:39,634 --> 00:43:41,265
You don't know what it's all about.

829
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:44,708
I am cold. Please take me back.

830
00:43:51,407 --> 00:43:53,070
Having fun, aren't you, Red?
- Yes.

831
00:43:53,406 --> 00:43:55,465
And I don't have to count tickets.
- No.

832
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,779
Phil. Joe said to tell you Carol has
gone home. She's got a headache.

833
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,203
Okay. Thanks.

834
00:44:03,255 --> 00:44:05,015
It looks like you're my date after all.

835
00:44:05,371 --> 00:44:07,034
It's a good thing I carried a spare.

836
00:44:08,915 --> 00:44:11,108
Phil. Maybe I shouldn't have stayed.

837
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:12,284
But you did.

838
00:44:13,496 --> 00:44:14,448
Cut in?
- No.

839
00:44:15,377 --> 00:44:17,105
Come on. We have six more clubs to do.

840
00:44:21,446 --> 00:44:23,519
Obviously Goofy Tucker.
Gathering berries.

841
00:44:26,275 --> 00:44:27,777
Why can't that be Goofy Tucker?

842
00:44:28,057 --> 00:44:30,269
Silly. He hasn't the well-turned
ankles of a Tucker.

843
00:44:32,814 --> 00:44:34,544
You're going the wrong way, my friend.

844
00:44:34,969 --> 00:44:36,782
Aiding a damsel in distress.

845
00:44:37,082 --> 00:44:40,371
Home, stop clowning.
Take me home. I'm so sleepy.

846
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:41,918
Alright, dear.

847
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,683
Yum, yum, yum.

848
00:44:46,995 --> 00:44:49,049
Welcome, brother. Welcome.

849
00:44:50,264 --> 00:44:52,973
Introduce me to the blessed demoiselle.

850
00:44:53,633 --> 00:44:55,070
I do not know you, my friend.

851
00:44:55,379 --> 00:44:57,268
Furthermore, you are
not this lady's type.

852
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,245
That's the password, brother.

853
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:02,680
Enter and the house is yours.

854
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:04,905
Who's that?

855
00:45:05,138 --> 00:45:07,939
I never saw him before in my life.
Probably some old alumnus.

856
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:29,461
This is terrific. What club is this?
- This is Plume.

857
00:45:29,862 --> 00:45:32,785
Where chiselling is the industry and
doubletalk the language of the house.

858
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:52,403
Cut in?
- Cut in, Phil?

859
00:45:52,615 --> 00:45:54,034
Definitely no.
- Listen.

860
00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:55,585
It's democracy.

861
00:45:55,797 --> 00:45:58,426
Come on, let's leave. I know a spot
where we get police protection.

862
00:45:58,638 --> 00:45:59,653
Police protection?

863
00:45:59,865 --> 00:46:01,108
Hi, Phil.
- Hi, Betty.

864
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,768
Have you seen wretched Tommy Torgler?
He was positively high.

865
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,235
Last seen, compass in hand
and heading due south.

866
00:46:08,225 --> 00:46:11,627
If you see him, ask him if he thinks
he's playing a game or something.

867
00:46:18,115 --> 00:46:18,970
Hello, Ted.

868
00:46:19,317 --> 00:46:21,262
For heaven's sake. With Alec Garner.

869
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:23,056
Custer's last stand.

870
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,326
Five more clubs. Can you take it?
- I'm just beginning.

871
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:01,821
Welcome, brother. Welcome.

872
00:47:02,175 --> 00:47:03,816
A friend from Delirium Tremens.

873
00:47:04,137 --> 00:47:07,037
Introduce me to the blessed demoiselle.

874
00:47:07,412 --> 00:47:09,352
Here we go again.
- Shush.

875
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:12,689
That's the password, brother.

876
00:47:13,074 --> 00:47:14,876
Proceed in safety.

877
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,020
Hey.

878
00:47:28,267 --> 00:47:29,577
He looks like a new man.

879
00:47:29,962 --> 00:47:31,512
I feel like a new woman.

880
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:36,675
Oh boy.

881
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:38,113
A woman.

882
00:47:39,993 --> 00:47:41,286
Hello Homer.

883
00:47:43,389 --> 00:47:44,108
Betty.

884
00:47:44,729 --> 00:47:45,760
[ Whistle ]

885
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:50,332
Say. Something tells me this is
going to be a beautiful evening.

886
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:53,317
Anybody ever tell you
you're a dream queen?

887
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:55,528
Anybody?

888
00:47:56,017 --> 00:47:57,965
People practically fight duels over me.

889
00:47:58,321 --> 00:48:00,960
Duels. If you know what I mean.
- Sure I do.

890
00:48:01,308 --> 00:48:04,220
You're certainly what I've been
looking for these past twenty years.

891
00:48:04,987 --> 00:48:06,004
You know, Homer.

892
00:48:06,296 --> 00:48:10,682
The first thing I noticed about was
your terribly sort-of mature viewpoint.

893
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,536
Yeah. That's why I go for older women.

894
00:48:15,739 --> 00:48:16,795
Why, Homer.

895
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:19,030
How excellently continental.

896
00:48:20,298 --> 00:48:24,021
What makes you so different
from all these other boys?

897
00:48:24,864 --> 00:48:27,077
Say. Let's really talk.

898
00:48:27,502 --> 00:48:29,004
Maybe there's a moon somewhere.

899
00:48:36,991 --> 00:48:39,058
Hiya, Griswold.
- Good evening, Smith.

900
00:48:40,544 --> 00:48:43,047
Never let it be said a Griswold
is less gallant than a Smith.

901
00:48:45,563 --> 00:48:46,837
Be seeing you, Griswold.

902
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,744
It is possible, Smith. It's possible.

903
00:48:51,106 --> 00:48:53,627
Are you comfortable, Phil?
- Don't worry about me.

904
00:48:54,425 --> 00:48:56,750
Welcome, brother, Welcome.

905
00:48:57,053 --> 00:48:58,820
Introduce me to the blessed demoiselle.

906
00:48:59,051 --> 00:49:00,501
Wait a minute, brother.

907
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,261
Don't get tough with me.

908
00:49:02,512 --> 00:49:04,055
That is the password, brother.

909
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:13,875
There's a woman growing out of his neck.

910
00:49:17,399 --> 00:49:18,157
Charlie.

911
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:19,246
No onions.

912
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:21,301
Every night you eat onions.

913
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:22,619
Why not tonight?

914
00:49:23,442 --> 00:49:24,104
Well.

915
00:49:24,391 --> 00:49:25,891
I just don't want onions.

916
00:49:26,103 --> 00:49:28,012
Whoever heard of
hamburgers without onions?

917
00:49:28,224 --> 00:49:29,435
It isn't even healthy.

918
00:49:29,784 --> 00:49:31,738
There's a girl with a
head on her shoulders.

919
00:49:32,128 --> 00:49:35,032
I'm surprised to see a smart girl
like you down at this place.

920
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,291
What's wrong with this place?
I think it's fun.

921
00:49:37,503 --> 00:49:38,123
Fun?

922
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:41,002
You should be here on a weekday.
It's a morgue.

923
00:49:41,508 --> 00:49:43,145
Study, study, study.

924
00:49:43,763 --> 00:49:45,664
I wonder what they think
they get out of it.

925
00:49:45,876 --> 00:49:47,014
Doctors, lawyers.

926
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:48,613
Bankers, politicians.

927
00:49:49,273 --> 00:49:51,192
One fellow down here got
to be an ambassador.

928
00:49:51,434 --> 00:49:52,839
Another got to be president.

929
00:49:53,165 --> 00:49:55,179
He lasted four years. Then he is out.

930
00:49:56,204 --> 00:49:57,578
Maybe it was worth it.

931
00:49:57,961 --> 00:49:59,966
But how old was he
when he got it? Sixty.

932
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:02,588
I've had my own business
since I was twenty-five.

933
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,671
That's what college does to people.

934
00:50:05,107 --> 00:50:07,029
So I tell you this. You eat onions.

935
00:50:07,574 --> 00:50:08,604
And like them.

936
00:50:16,788 --> 00:50:17,653
Good.

937
00:50:18,384 --> 00:50:19,142
Perfect.

938
00:50:20,034 --> 00:50:22,676
You know. Charlie wouldn't
trade jobs with the president.

939
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:24,823
He is what I'd call a happy man.

940
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:26,746
It must be swell to be that happy.

941
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,238
Yep. Must be.

942
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:30,511
I suppose you're not?

943
00:50:31,936 --> 00:50:32,598
Well.

944
00:50:33,258 --> 00:50:34,695
You probably wouldn't see it.

945
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,062
But I have a rather large handicap
being Philip S. Griswold the third.

946
00:50:40,218 --> 00:50:41,709
I mean it. It is pretty tough.

947
00:50:41,964 --> 00:50:43,175
You and Daphne Graves.

948
00:50:43,991 --> 00:50:45,908
Park Avenue. Kingsford.

949
00:50:46,299 --> 00:50:47,425
And Wall Street.

950
00:50:47,815 --> 00:50:50,197
And I'm so bored with it all.

951
00:50:50,953 --> 00:50:54,129
You can't imagine how monotonous it is
never to have doubts about the future.

952
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:56,379
Listen. I know worse
things than monotony.

953
00:50:56,649 --> 00:50:59,974
How would you like to have your whole
life laid out for you by somebody else?

954
00:51:01,414 --> 00:51:02,963
You're in a golden rut.

955
00:51:06,648 --> 00:51:08,343
That did sound pretty bad, didn't it?

956
00:51:09,678 --> 00:51:10,824
Jane, it's just ..

957
00:51:11,645 --> 00:51:13,922
I think I would have liked
to have picked my own life.

958
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:15,531
Why don't you?

959
00:51:17,255 --> 00:51:18,175
I don't know.

960
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,971
I guess the other way is so easy.

961
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:27,264
Come. Let's get out of here, shall we?

962
00:51:29,843 --> 00:51:31,511
Goodnight, Charlie.
- Goodnight.

963
00:51:33,652 --> 00:51:34,824
Goodnight, Charlie.

964
00:51:35,743 --> 00:51:36,589
Goodnight.

965
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:40,500
Good morning.
- Good morning.

966
00:51:45,831 --> 00:51:48,526
It must be spring.
I can smell the sunrise.

967
00:51:48,845 --> 00:51:50,602
It must be mental telepathy. So can I.

968
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:57,859
Sleepy, Red?
- No.

969
00:51:58,368 --> 00:52:00,783
Just happy.
- An old stay-out, you mean.

970
00:52:02,235 --> 00:52:06,697
Seriously, Red. Did you ever see a more
beautiful sunrise than this in Kansas?

971
00:52:07,063 --> 00:52:08,116
No. Never.

972
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:11,546
It's all been so wonderful, Phil.
I'll never forget it.

973
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:14,256
Now wait a minute.
That sounds like a farewell speech.

974
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:16,260
Aren't we going to see each other again?

975
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:18,659
Sure. This is only the beginning.

976
00:52:19,063 --> 00:52:22,701
This next weekend and the weekend
after and the weekend after that and ..

977
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,950
Am I going too fast for you?
- No.

978
00:52:26,011 --> 00:52:27,539
Phil. That will be swell.

979
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:30,235
We will see New York like
it's never been seen before.

980
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,338
Where would you like to go first?

981
00:52:33,265 --> 00:52:36,390
You know, I've been in New York a full
year and I've never been to the zoo.

982
00:52:36,666 --> 00:52:37,328
What?

983
00:52:39,344 --> 00:52:41,492
Come to think of it,
I've never been there myself.

984
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:46,090
Imagine a girl passing up a
nightclub for a monkey house.

985
00:52:46,533 --> 00:52:47,744
Are they so different?

986
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:50,593
You and I are going to have fun alright.

987
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:56,145
What's the matter, Joan?

988
00:52:57,478 --> 00:52:58,140
Phil.

989
00:52:58,793 --> 00:52:59,842
What about Carol?

990
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:01,298
Carol?

991
00:53:01,905 --> 00:53:03,492
She's a swell girl.

992
00:53:04,511 --> 00:53:06,310
We've gone around together a lot.

993
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,702
We've both run around with other people.

994
00:53:14,412 --> 00:53:15,446
Here we are.

995
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:44,938
Well, goodnight.

996
00:53:46,026 --> 00:53:48,048
I know. You have six room-mates.

997
00:53:50,904 --> 00:53:52,470
Red, I'm glad you didn't go home.

998
00:54:11,388 --> 00:54:12,161
Hi, Joe.

999
00:54:13,341 --> 00:54:14,316
How is Carol?

1000
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:16,650
Alright, I guess.

1001
00:54:19,474 --> 00:54:20,922
Walk back to Blake with me.

1002
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:23,910
No thanks, Phil.

1003
00:54:31,932 --> 00:54:32,626
Hello.

1004
00:54:33,877 --> 00:54:35,476
If it isn't the belle of the ball.

1005
00:54:38,811 --> 00:54:40,248
I'm sorry you had a headache.

1006
00:54:41,882 --> 00:54:43,028
Did that get around?

1007
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:45,439
There seems to be quite
an epidemic of headaches.

1008
00:54:46,405 --> 00:54:49,412
Daphne, when you grow up
10-1 you turn into a witch.

1009
00:54:50,783 --> 00:54:53,377
Did you have a good time?
- I had a wonderful time.

1010
00:54:53,677 --> 00:54:56,758
After Daphne told them I worked in a
dance hall they thought I was hot stuff.

1011
00:55:11,532 --> 00:55:13,241
Well, what are you all doing?

1012
00:55:13,729 --> 00:55:14,875
Having a convention?

1013
00:55:34,244 --> 00:55:35,875
What are you all staring at me for?

1014
00:55:38,122 --> 00:55:39,365
What do you think I am?

1015
00:55:40,569 --> 00:55:42,006
Scarlett O'Hara or something?

1016
00:55:52,138 --> 00:55:53,148
[ Telephone ]

1017
00:55:59,363 --> 00:56:00,049
Hello.

1018
00:56:00,261 --> 00:56:02,507
Hello. Phil Griswold please.
This is his father.

1019
00:56:02,986 --> 00:56:04,132
It's very important.

1020
00:56:04,958 --> 00:56:06,072
Never heard of him.

1021
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:09,169
Hello. Hello.

1022
00:56:10,446 --> 00:56:11,269
Operator.

1023
00:56:16,011 --> 00:56:17,727
It's only seven-thirty.

1024
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:21,567
One o'clock?

1025
00:56:22,027 --> 00:56:23,863
We got to take the
girls to the crew races.

1026
00:56:24,075 --> 00:56:24,885
No rush.

1027
00:56:25,209 --> 00:56:26,839
Treat 'em mean, keeps 'em keen.

1028
00:56:29,811 --> 00:56:32,228
You pulled about the best
trick of the week last night.

1029
00:56:33,093 --> 00:56:33,965
Such as?

1030
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:36,660
Such as that dime-a-dance babe.

1031
00:56:37,068 --> 00:56:38,570
Where did you two disappear to?

1032
00:56:39,072 --> 00:56:40,024
Cut it, Homer.

1033
00:56:41,129 --> 00:56:42,350
I am sorry, Phil.

1034
00:56:42,805 --> 00:56:45,350
I didn't know a crack about a
taxi dancer would get you sore.

1035
00:56:45,748 --> 00:56:47,839
I guess you've known too many debs.

1036
00:56:48,588 --> 00:56:49,898
Okay. Have it your way.

1037
00:57:02,507 --> 00:57:04,766
Say, that was quite a brawl last night.

1038
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:07,226
A very, very large party.

1039
00:57:07,828 --> 00:57:09,010
Or could I be wrong?

1040
00:57:15,391 --> 00:57:17,636
One of the girls must have left
it here yesterday afternoon.

1041
00:57:17,848 --> 00:57:19,382
Homer, you're way out of bounds.

1042
00:57:20,044 --> 00:57:21,089
I don't know.

1043
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:23,423
She's been around. Besides ..

1044
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,208
In case you don't know it.
I think you are a heel.

1045
00:57:35,335 --> 00:57:37,289
You mix them before you
put them in the pan.

1046
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:39,124
Not where I come from you don't.

1047
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:40,528
Hello.

1048
00:57:40,807 --> 00:57:42,718
May I drop mine in? Hello.
- Morning.

1049
00:57:42,944 --> 00:57:45,006
He wanted to put milk in them.
- How awful.

1050
00:57:45,316 --> 00:57:46,462
Here, you take over.

1051
00:57:46,932 --> 00:57:48,769
Any child knows that's not the way ..

1052
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:52,896
Well, where's Homer?

1053
00:57:53,146 --> 00:57:54,937
I had a date with him for one o'clock.

1054
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:57,280
Danger. Women at work.

1055
00:57:57,711 --> 00:57:58,764
Morning, Phil.

1056
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:00,899
Good morning, darling. You're late.

1057
00:58:01,255 --> 00:58:02,184
Late for what?

1058
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:04,640
Just like a man. Grumpy at breakfast.

1059
00:58:08,328 --> 00:58:09,915
My, what an unattractive room.

1060
00:58:10,431 --> 00:58:11,614
It is a kitchen.

1061
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:15,605
All I want is a cup of coffee
on the lawn in the sunshine.

1062
00:58:15,997 --> 00:58:18,088
Breakfast outdoors?
That's a wonderful idea.

1063
00:58:18,744 --> 00:58:19,445
Men.

1064
00:58:19,671 --> 00:58:20,450
To work.

1065
00:58:25,267 --> 00:58:28,667
Find a gal who knows her eggs.
That's what my old father told me.

1066
00:58:28,918 --> 00:58:30,399
Your father was smart.

1067
00:58:30,993 --> 00:58:31,999
Wait a minute.

1068
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:34,222
The Griswolds like them
counter clockwise.

1069
00:58:39,535 --> 00:58:40,888
Good morning everybody.

1070
00:58:41,506 --> 00:58:42,986
Not that it's still morning.

1071
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:45,624
Pull up a chair, Betty.
The original sidewalk cafÃ©.

1072
00:58:46,498 --> 00:58:47,387
Hello Betty.

1073
00:58:48,479 --> 00:58:49,367
Hello Homer.

1074
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,888
If Miss Ainsbridge will
only have this chair.

1075
00:58:53,437 --> 00:58:54,546
Aren't you gallant.

1076
00:58:54,758 --> 00:58:56,130
At so early in the morning.

1077
00:58:56,382 --> 00:58:58,010
Maybe it's early for <i>some</i> people.

1078
00:58:58,752 --> 00:59:00,335
Homer, I want to eat.

1079
00:59:00,767 --> 00:59:01,933
What's stopping you?

1080
00:59:04,144 --> 00:59:05,226
Hiya, white folks.

1081
00:59:05,825 --> 00:59:06,648
Hey, look.

1082
00:59:09,142 --> 00:59:10,524
Whoa, Homer.

1083
00:59:12,724 --> 00:59:15,014
That's awful. Calling that horse Homer.

1084
00:59:15,299 --> 00:59:16,685
Not from Tommy's angle.

1085
00:59:17,014 --> 00:59:17,820
Hey.

1086
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:26,979
Milk. What is it for?

1087
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:28,693
You see it's like this.

1088
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:32,150
I was walking down the street
just minding my own business.

1089
00:59:32,522 --> 00:59:33,701
I heard a voice call:

1090
00:59:33,944 --> 00:59:35,833
'Mister, would you like
to buy some milk'?

1091
00:59:36,104 --> 00:59:39,073
There was something about that voice
that made me turn to see who it was.

1092
00:59:40,373 --> 00:59:41,519
You know who it was?

1093
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:42,868
The horse.

1094
00:59:43,394 --> 00:59:43,991
Ha.

1095
00:59:44,718 --> 00:59:46,252
That's right. How did you guess?

1096
00:59:47,972 --> 00:59:49,754
Well, now he's brought the milk.

1097
00:59:50,606 --> 00:59:51,997
Let's drink it.
- Drink it?

1098
00:59:52,209 --> 00:59:54,195
That might be a noble experiment.
- Go ahead.

1099
00:59:55,723 --> 00:59:57,225
Personally, I prefer champagne.

1100
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:58,919
Champagne for breakfast?

1101
00:59:59,248 --> 01:00:01,489
We always have champagne
for breakfast at Kingsford.

1102
01:00:01,883 --> 01:00:04,745
But doesn't champagne need
a pretty special celebration?

1103
01:00:05,107 --> 01:00:06,317
We're celebrating.

1104
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,169
Jane means something official.

1105
01:00:08,527 --> 01:00:10,830
Like a funeral or a wedding or ..

1106
01:00:11,605 --> 01:00:12,719
Or an announcement.

1107
01:00:12,961 --> 01:00:14,301
Isn't that what you meant?

1108
01:00:14,762 --> 01:00:15,575
Come on.

1109
01:00:15,787 --> 01:00:17,773
It's high time you announced
your engagement.

1110
01:00:23,857 --> 01:00:25,671
I guess now is as good a time as any.

1111
01:00:28,064 --> 01:00:29,425
If Phil could take it.

1112
01:00:30,133 --> 01:00:31,913
A Griswold can always take it.

1113
01:00:32,737 --> 01:00:34,109
Here's to the happy couple.

1114
01:00:34,955 --> 01:00:36,226
Announcements by Tiffany.

1115
01:00:36,438 --> 01:00:37,676
Trousseau by Alex.

1116
01:00:38,096 --> 01:00:39,304
Honeymoon by Blue Star.

1117
01:00:39,516 --> 01:00:42,522
And alimony courtesy of the
Griswold Sneed Investment Company.

1118
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:44,128
I drink to you both.

1119
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,939
With the champagne of the country.

1120
01:00:49,567 --> 01:00:51,998
If we're going to the Crew Race
we'd better get started.

1121
01:00:52,537 --> 01:00:54,486
Greetings, friends. Greetings.

1122
01:00:55,077 --> 01:00:58,420
Did I hear someone say 'champagne'?

1123
01:00:59,246 --> 01:01:01,238
For you, my friend.
- I thank you.

1124
01:01:02,788 --> 01:01:05,145
Ah .. white champagne.

1125
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,885
My favorite kind.

1126
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:10,134
Your health, brother.

1127
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:16,807
Just time for one more
drink before the Crew Race.

1128
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:19,087
Three cheers for the princess.

1129
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,909
Harvard, Harvard, Harvard.

1130
01:01:21,153 --> 01:01:22,822
He thinks he's at Harvard.

1131
01:01:23,076 --> 01:01:25,279
My friend, you're two hundred
miles off your course.

1132
01:01:25,491 --> 01:01:26,573
This is Kingsford.

1133
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,117
Kingsford?

1134
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:30,887
Kingsford.

1135
01:01:33,747 --> 01:01:35,296
A typical Harvard man.

1136
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:38,484
Come on. We haven't much time.
- Yes. That's true.

1137
01:01:46,394 --> 01:01:47,831
Do you want to see that race?

1138
01:01:48,581 --> 01:01:50,329
No. I don't.
- Neither do I.

1139
01:01:53,131 --> 01:01:55,268
What about going some
place with me? I mean ..

1140
01:01:55,959 --> 01:01:57,600
Echo Beach opened last week.

1141
01:01:58,237 --> 01:01:59,346
Yes. Let's go.

1142
01:02:00,761 --> 01:02:02,286
Let's go and have some fun.

1143
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:03,672
Yeah.

1144
01:02:15,464 --> 01:02:16,126
Well.

1145
01:02:17,092 --> 01:02:19,498
Nothing is ever as exciting as
you think it's going to be.

1146
01:02:20,053 --> 01:02:21,053
Kingsford was.

1147
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,216
But you haven't really seen Kingsford.

1148
01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:26,929
A bunch of spoiled kids whooping it up
over a weekend. That's only one side.

1149
01:02:27,329 --> 01:02:28,666
It's the side I saw.

1150
01:02:29,415 --> 01:02:30,981
If that's all there was to Kingsford.

1151
01:02:31,193 --> 01:02:34,052
You think I'd have spent four years
carrying laundry and washing dishes?

1152
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,365
Why did you?

1153
01:02:36,374 --> 01:02:37,188
Well.

1154
01:02:38,139 --> 01:02:39,936
My father got his degree there and ..

1155
01:02:40,378 --> 01:02:41,523
His father too.

1156
01:02:42,238 --> 01:02:45,087
I guess there's a tradition about
the place. It gets in your blood.

1157
01:02:46,542 --> 01:02:47,333
You know.

1158
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:51,215
You know, 150 years ago the students
in those same brownstone buildings ..

1159
01:02:51,428 --> 01:02:54,198
Laid down their books and
picked up their muskets and ..

1160
01:02:54,442 --> 01:02:56,885
Went out and fought the
revolutionary war and then ..

1161
01:03:00,194 --> 01:03:00,856
Jane.

1162
01:03:02,218 --> 01:03:03,434
Yes. I guess so.

1163
01:03:04,097 --> 01:03:06,116
You haven't heard a thing
I've said, have you?

1164
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:07,368
No.

1165
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:09,614
Come on, come on.

1166
01:03:09,887 --> 01:03:11,997
You look like the spirit
of Christmas past.

1167
01:03:12,391 --> 01:03:13,509
How about a smile?

1168
01:03:23,757 --> 01:03:25,338
Fancy meeting you here.

1169
01:03:25,692 --> 01:03:26,967
Yes. It's a small world.

1170
01:03:28,753 --> 01:03:29,673
Hello, Carol.

1171
01:03:30,837 --> 01:03:31,660
Hello Joe.

1172
01:03:32,006 --> 01:03:33,217
How was the Crew Race?

1173
01:03:33,865 --> 01:03:35,617
We didn't see it for the finish.

1174
01:03:35,967 --> 01:03:37,475
Phil thought this sounded like fun.

1175
01:03:37,694 --> 01:03:40,745
We decided to see how Mr and Mrs
South Brooklyn spend their weekends.

1176
01:03:41,392 --> 01:03:42,054
Well.

1177
01:03:42,672 --> 01:03:46,529
Jane and I just decided we were
beyond all this. We were just going.

1178
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:48,008
You can't go now.

1179
01:03:48,353 --> 01:03:49,310
We had better.

1180
01:03:50,509 --> 01:03:52,152
Harvard. Harvard.

1181
01:03:52,631 --> 01:03:53,931
Rah-rah-rah.

1182
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,355
Fresh air.

1183
01:04:03,988 --> 01:04:05,063
Shake him.

1184
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:07,785
Come on, Betty.

1185
01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:09,678
Homer, wait for me.

1186
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:13,949
Really. I don't see how Homer possibly
gets like that after six lemonades.

1187
01:04:14,465 --> 01:04:16,976
Jane, I must talk to you.
- There's nothing to talk about.

1188
01:04:21,205 --> 01:04:23,664
This is a divine spot.
They will never find us here.

1189
01:04:24,163 --> 01:04:24,913
Okay.

1190
01:04:26,182 --> 01:04:27,111
Two tickets.

1191
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:31,423
He is in there.
He's in there with that woman.

1192
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,914
Man overboard.
Last one is a Harvard man.

1193
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:36,842
Homer.

1194
01:04:39,711 --> 01:04:41,043
Homer, where are you?

1195
01:04:42,473 --> 01:04:44,970
Honestly. This is all too confusing.

1196
01:04:45,355 --> 01:04:47,327
It would take a genius
to get out of here.

1197
01:04:48,767 --> 01:04:50,139
It's all done with mirrors.

1198
01:04:53,962 --> 01:04:54,796
Homer.

1199
01:04:56,751 --> 01:04:58,182
Homer. Where are you?

1200
01:04:59,487 --> 01:05:02,272
I hate places like this.
I've got claustrophobia.

1201
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:04,001
And Homer's got Betty.

1202
01:05:04,295 --> 01:05:06,025
Betty. Why can't she
get a man of her own?

1203
01:05:06,237 --> 01:05:07,579
With that 1936 technique?

1204
01:05:07,974 --> 01:05:08,829
Poor Betty.

1205
01:05:09,129 --> 01:05:10,950
If she would only stop
this prom trotting.

1206
01:05:11,162 --> 01:05:13,553
She should get married before
she misses the boat altogether.

1207
01:05:13,765 --> 01:05:15,331
Girls. Here's the exit.
- Where?

1208
01:05:15,817 --> 01:05:16,511
Where?

1209
01:05:17,462 --> 01:05:19,248
Where? Where is it?

1210
01:05:25,478 --> 01:05:27,134
Ah, there you are.

1211
01:05:28,059 --> 01:05:29,120
My dream queen.

1212
01:05:29,515 --> 01:05:30,932
I have missed you.

1213
01:05:32,822 --> 01:05:34,396
I have missed you too, Homer.

1214
01:05:35,006 --> 01:05:36,790
But loveliness, where are you?

1215
01:05:39,153 --> 01:05:40,095
Is that you?

1216
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:45,978
Look.

1217
01:05:46,771 --> 01:05:48,901
Look at all the wonderful Betties.

1218
01:05:49,314 --> 01:05:50,056
Homer.

1219
01:05:50,493 --> 01:05:52,875
I'm sick of this place.
Let's do something different.

1220
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:54,965
Let's do something exciting.
- Yes.

1221
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,249
Alright. Come on.

1222
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:00,699
Hello, babe.

1223
01:06:01,716 --> 01:06:02,410
Hello.

1224
01:06:02,909 --> 01:06:05,283
Say, how do you get out of this place?
- Please don't go.

1225
01:06:05,552 --> 01:06:06,840
I want to explain about ..

1226
01:06:07,052 --> 01:06:08,715
That announcement of our engagement.

1227
01:06:09,029 --> 01:06:11,888
There had never been anything definite.
We'd never even spoken about it.

1228
01:06:12,264 --> 01:06:13,979
Too bad Daphne put you on the spot.

1229
01:06:15,494 --> 01:06:16,709
It doesn't really matter.

1230
01:06:16,921 --> 01:06:19,858
After all, people are always falling
in and out of engagements.

1231
01:06:20,187 --> 01:06:21,801
You and I can still have fun.

1232
01:06:23,264 --> 01:06:25,873
Thanks a lot, but from now on
I'm passing up double dates.

1233
01:06:26,093 --> 01:06:27,627
Wait a minute.
- Wait for what?

1234
01:06:28,324 --> 01:06:31,199
For somebody to make up your mind for
you whether you're engaged or not?

1235
01:06:32,386 --> 01:06:33,864
Listen, where I come from ..

1236
01:06:34,372 --> 01:06:37,289
People get engaged because they
are in love and <i>want</i> to get married.

1237
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,120
Of course, that ..

1238
01:06:41,147 --> 01:06:44,118
That's probably too honest and
simple for you and your crowd.

1239
01:06:47,946 --> 01:06:50,070
Where's Phil?
- You mean, where's Homer and Betty?

1240
01:06:50,282 --> 01:06:51,622
Jane. Where are you going?

1241
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,363
Jane. Don't leave yet.
Stick around and have some fun.

1242
01:06:54,757 --> 01:06:56,679
You'll learn to love
us as the years go by.

1243
01:07:02,034 --> 01:07:04,546
Listen, you wisecracking,
back-knifing glamour girl.

1244
01:07:05,056 --> 01:07:07,139
I've had all of your kind
of fun that I can use.

1245
01:07:07,551 --> 01:07:09,631
I wouldn't breathe the same
air with you and your ..

1246
01:07:09,843 --> 01:07:11,862
Pedigree polo shirts for
another five minutes.

1247
01:07:12,088 --> 01:07:13,779
Well, really.
- Go ahead, Jane.

1248
01:07:14,304 --> 01:07:15,838
The glamour girls and their men.

1249
01:07:16,345 --> 01:07:18,084
Men? This herd of calves?

1250
01:07:18,727 --> 01:07:20,519
You can give me the mugs at the Joylane.

1251
01:07:22,082 --> 01:07:23,594
Mr and Mrs South Brooklyn ..

1252
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:26,215
Know more about living than you
and your whole phony crowd.

1253
01:07:26,427 --> 01:07:27,645
Champagne for breakfast.

1254
01:07:27,857 --> 01:07:29,166
Two-timing for lunch.

1255
01:07:29,773 --> 01:07:31,533
It's family and background that matter.

1256
01:07:32,341 --> 01:07:35,338
So listen, upper crust. Go home to your
families and rest on your backgrounds.

1257
01:07:35,816 --> 01:07:38,989
For the pedigree and a nickel you
can buy a cup of coffee in Kansas.

1258
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,435
Boy, what a sucker I was.

1259
01:07:43,368 --> 01:07:44,557
I wanted to meet you.

1260
01:07:45,841 --> 01:07:46,973
The nice people.

1261
01:07:49,614 --> 01:07:51,213
I think she's got something there.

1262
01:07:53,301 --> 01:07:55,058
What is this? A revival meeting?

1263
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:57,692
Did you ever in your whole life ..

1264
01:07:58,383 --> 01:07:59,724
Why, that awful girl.

1265
01:08:00,446 --> 01:08:02,010
She called you a calf.

1266
01:08:02,451 --> 01:08:03,209
Shut up.

1267
01:08:06,278 --> 01:08:07,747
Well, all you terrible people.

1268
01:08:08,433 --> 01:08:11,439
What kind of a hideous, blue-blooded
time shall we have for ourselves now?

1269
01:08:11,774 --> 01:08:14,150
Read all about it. Extra, extra.

1270
01:08:14,485 --> 01:08:16,147
Come on. Loosen up, you guys.

1271
01:08:16,922 --> 01:08:18,391
Hey, I will buy your business.

1272
01:08:19,663 --> 01:08:20,293
Hey.

1273
01:08:20,626 --> 01:08:21,938
You're a big-shot.

1274
01:08:22,269 --> 01:08:23,057
Thanks.

1275
01:08:23,406 --> 01:08:26,381
Extra. Special. Get your
Saturday night edition paper.

1276
01:08:26,678 --> 01:08:27,703
Read all about it.

1277
01:08:27,915 --> 01:08:29,473
What's wrong with the upper classes?

1278
01:08:29,685 --> 01:08:32,247
The night edition.
What's wrong with the upper classes?

1279
01:08:32,623 --> 01:08:34,750
Get your special Saturday
night edition. Extra!

1280
01:08:35,034 --> 01:08:37,470
Read all about it.
What's wrong with the upper classes?

1281
01:08:52,869 --> 01:08:53,531
Phil.

1282
01:08:53,885 --> 01:08:55,484
Where are you going?
- Telephone.

1283
01:08:57,838 --> 01:08:58,518
Dad.

1284
01:08:58,895 --> 01:08:59,852
Hello, dad.

1285
01:09:00,181 --> 01:09:01,166
Hello, Mr Phil.

1286
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,552
This is Reeves. Your father isn't here.

1287
01:09:04,809 --> 01:09:06,577
He didn't say when he would be back.

1288
01:09:07,722 --> 01:09:09,238
Mr Phil, they took him down ..

1289
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:20,601
Phil. Is it ..?
- Yeah.

1290
01:09:22,566 --> 01:09:23,827
I'm going to New York.

1291
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:28,451
Why did you give him my car?

1292
01:09:28,797 --> 01:09:29,911
He said it was his.

1293
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,358
Which one of you dames is Mary Rose?
- I am.

1294
01:09:32,821 --> 01:09:35,015
The screwball said to tell you
he'd be home by September.

1295
01:09:35,227 --> 01:09:37,224
He has gone to get married.
- To get married?

1296
01:09:38,062 --> 01:09:40,211
You dope. That's what
you get for nagging him.

1297
01:09:40,715 --> 01:09:42,238
Phil. Take my car.

1298
01:09:43,668 --> 01:09:44,777
Thanks, Greg.

1299
01:09:46,686 --> 01:09:47,348
Phil.

1300
01:09:47,977 --> 01:09:50,277
I will go with you.
- No. I think I'd better go alone.

1301
01:09:51,181 --> 01:09:52,550
You're sure?
- Yes.

1302
01:09:53,952 --> 01:09:55,163
Yes, Carol. I am sure.

1303
01:09:56,497 --> 01:09:57,159
Well.

1304
01:09:58,686 --> 01:09:59,444
Goodbye.

1305
01:10:00,017 --> 01:10:00,775
Goodbye.

1306
01:10:09,494 --> 01:10:11,157
I'll take you into Kingsford, Carol.

1307
01:10:14,249 --> 01:10:14,967
Carol.

1308
01:10:15,761 --> 01:10:18,209
How would you like to drive back
to New York with me? Right now.

1309
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:24,469
Thanks, Tommy. But ..

1310
01:10:26,285 --> 01:10:27,622
I think I'll go with Joe.

1311
01:10:36,545 --> 01:10:38,314
Darling. Wake up. Here we are.

1312
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:43,871
Come on.

1313
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:54,464
Ah, what are we doing here?

1314
01:10:55,613 --> 01:10:56,394
Homer.

1315
01:10:56,812 --> 01:10:58,885
We're going to be married.
Don't you remember?

1316
01:10:59,184 --> 01:10:59,942
Married?

1317
01:11:00,249 --> 01:11:01,007
Married?

1318
01:11:01,396 --> 01:11:03,230
I don't want to get married.

1319
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:05,941
But darling, we have to.

1320
01:11:06,493 --> 01:11:08,609
We told that parking
attendant to tell everybody.

1321
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:10,562
I'm not going to get married.

1322
01:11:13,413 --> 01:11:14,622
I'm a bachelor.

1323
01:11:25,361 --> 01:11:27,053
Betty. Wait for me. Don't leave me.

1324
01:11:32,058 --> 01:11:33,845
Gee, you are a swell sport, Betty.

1325
01:11:42,328 --> 01:11:45,131
"<i>Poor Betty. She should get married
before she misses the boat altogether</i>."

1326
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,329
"<i>Betty. Why doesn't she
understand priority?</i>"

1327
01:11:47,748 --> 01:11:49,465
"<i>Why doesn't she get a man of her own?</i>"

1328
01:11:49,677 --> 01:11:51,469
"<i>Why doesn't she get a man of her own?</i>."

1329
01:12:38,281 --> 01:12:39,106
Betty.

1330
01:12:44,045 --> 01:12:44,796
Betty!

1331
01:12:57,675 --> 01:12:58,627
He is in here.

1332
01:13:01,122 --> 01:13:02,750
Dad.
- Hello, Phil.

1333
01:13:03,939 --> 01:13:06,475
I would like to be alone with my son.
- Yes, sir. Mr Griswold.

1334
01:13:07,542 --> 01:13:09,402
Everything is going to be alright, Phil.

1335
01:13:09,821 --> 01:13:12,785
I tried to get in touch with you
yesterday before you saw the papers.

1336
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:15,414
Things aren't quite as
black as they're painted.

1337
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,502
Dad.

1338
01:13:16,714 --> 01:13:18,488
They won't be able to keep me here.

1339
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,548
And once this is over.

1340
01:13:20,942 --> 01:13:22,637
There's plenty of money I can get at.

1341
01:13:22,896 --> 01:13:24,368
The papers said you were bankrupt.

1342
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:27,429
The Griswold Sneed Investment
Company is bankrupt.

1343
01:13:29,261 --> 01:13:29,955
I see.

1344
01:13:32,882 --> 01:13:34,355
You've nothing to worry about.

1345
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,057
I made sure of that.

1346
01:13:36,352 --> 01:13:38,144
There's quite a good chunk in your name.

1347
01:13:39,345 --> 01:13:40,556
No-one can touch that.

1348
01:13:40,853 --> 01:13:42,674
You can finish college and ..
- Father.

1349
01:13:43,149 --> 01:13:46,080
If there's any money in my name
it goes back to your stockholders.

1350
01:13:46,481 --> 01:13:48,147
There's no legal responsibility.

1351
01:13:48,382 --> 01:13:49,779
I'm not thinking about the law.

1352
01:13:50,069 --> 01:13:52,596
This is no time for schoolboy heroics.

1353
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:56,947
Listen, son.

1354
01:13:57,689 --> 01:13:59,094
Ever since you were a child.

1355
01:13:59,995 --> 01:14:04,413
All I wanted was for you to have
every possible advantage.

1356
01:14:05,184 --> 01:14:07,720
Father, I want to thank you for
everything you've done for me.

1357
01:14:08,228 --> 01:14:10,580
But we have had the wrong
ideas about advantages.

1358
01:14:10,998 --> 01:14:14,059
It's all so clear in my mind
but I can't quite express it.

1359
01:14:14,924 --> 01:14:19,658
All I know is, I want no further part of
this wacky selfish upper-crust business.

1360
01:14:19,994 --> 01:14:21,055
What about Carol?

1361
01:14:21,737 --> 01:14:22,691
That is over.

1362
01:14:23,136 --> 01:14:25,668
Carol and I didn't even
need words to say goodbye.

1363
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,737
I am sorry.
- I am not.

1364
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,981
It was all part of a phony set up.

1365
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:35,331
You know, the last few days things have
begun to have different meanings for me.

1366
01:14:36,044 --> 01:14:38,386
There's one thing that doesn't
change its meaning, Phil.

1367
01:14:38,688 --> 01:14:39,382
Money.

1368
01:14:39,641 --> 01:14:42,251
You won't even be able to
finish college without it.

1369
01:14:43,448 --> 01:14:44,344
Take it, son.

1370
01:14:44,556 --> 01:14:45,154
No.

1371
01:14:45,589 --> 01:14:48,003
No. Somehow all the things
I've had and needed ..

1372
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:51,013
College and security and
all that social stuff.

1373
01:14:51,702 --> 01:14:53,352
It don't seem to mean a thing anymore.

1374
01:14:53,564 --> 01:14:54,904
They don't seem important.

1375
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:57,584
Maybe last week I would
have taken the money.

1376
01:14:57,796 --> 01:14:58,625
But now?

1377
01:14:59,114 --> 01:15:00,682
I know it's just no good.

1378
01:15:02,377 --> 01:15:03,400
I'm sorry.

1379
01:15:03,813 --> 01:15:05,912
It's a fine time for me
to be preaching to you.

1380
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:07,226
Phil.

1381
01:15:07,831 --> 01:15:09,810
I don't seem to have
known you very well.

1382
01:15:11,077 --> 01:15:14,082
I don't seem to have known myself
very well until the last few days.

1383
01:15:14,429 --> 01:15:15,845
You're sure about the money?

1384
01:15:16,717 --> 01:15:17,702
Yes. I am sure.

1385
01:15:18,003 --> 01:15:19,192
[ Door knocks ]

1386
01:15:19,546 --> 01:15:21,981
Mr Griswold. They want you
down at the investigator's office.

1387
01:15:22,193 --> 01:15:22,887
Right.

1388
01:15:24,813 --> 01:15:25,765
Goodbye, Phil.

1389
01:15:26,096 --> 01:15:27,016
Goodbye, dad.

1390
01:15:31,835 --> 01:15:32,917
I know what it is.

1391
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:35,078
You used to be stubborn like a kid.

1392
01:15:35,559 --> 01:15:37,061
Now you're stubborn like a man.

1393
01:15:37,781 --> 01:15:38,766
Good luck, son.

1394
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:56,735
'Financier Griswold confesses guilt in
the speediest trial of recent record'.

1395
01:15:58,336 --> 01:16:00,250
I told you they were a bunch of phonies.

1396
01:16:00,964 --> 01:16:02,234
Blue bloods, eh?

1397
01:16:06,259 --> 01:16:09,616
I wonder what young Mr Griswold
the 3rd will do with himself now.

1398
01:16:10,425 --> 01:16:12,120
Not only does his old man go to jail.

1399
01:16:12,527 --> 01:16:14,631
The paper says the
whole family is busted.

1400
01:16:14,969 --> 01:16:15,648
Flat.

1401
01:16:17,485 --> 01:16:19,511
You're in love with that
big lug, aren't you?

1402
01:16:19,723 --> 01:16:21,289
After the run-around he gave you.

1403
01:16:21,686 --> 01:16:23,058
Now you feel sorry for him.

1404
01:16:23,416 --> 01:16:25,338
Why don't you go and
tell him all about it?

1405
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:27,656
Mavis.

1406
01:16:28,686 --> 01:16:30,855
He never wants to see me again.
I know that.

1407
01:16:32,566 --> 01:16:34,609
If it just hadn't happened that way ..

1408
01:16:35,702 --> 01:16:37,270
Well .. it did.

1409
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:39,555
Come on, honey.

1410
01:16:40,231 --> 01:16:41,927
No use crying over spilled bankers.

1411
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:44,752
The dance floor is full of that type.

1412
01:16:52,686 --> 01:16:55,089
Pardon me, Miss. May I have
the pleasure of this dance?

1413
01:16:56,010 --> 01:16:57,136
It's all mine.

1414
01:17:05,313 --> 01:17:06,327
Cut in, please.

1415
01:17:08,241 --> 01:17:09,180
It isn't ..

1416
01:17:11,458 --> 01:17:13,305
But this lady is ..
- You don't understand.

1417
01:17:13,517 --> 01:17:15,337
This is my mother.
- Yes. But she ..

1418
01:17:27,692 --> 01:17:29,895
I'm awfully glad that
you came down here.

1419
01:17:31,448 --> 01:17:34,037
I wanted to see you before you
left for Tahiti to tell you ..

1420
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:35,214
Tahiti?

1421
01:17:37,792 --> 01:17:39,559
I'm not going to Tahiti, Red.

1422
01:17:41,042 --> 01:17:42,843
But you wanted to live your own life.

1423
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:45,185
You wanted to go away and ..

1424
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:48,426
And you can travel.
- Red, I've been travelling for days.

1425
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:51,257
But I couldn't get any
further than the Joylane.

1426
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:43,186
..t-g..
