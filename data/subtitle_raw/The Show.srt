1
00:00:56,554 --> 00:00:57,756
Welcome back.

2
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:00,292
We are broadcasting live
from Seattle

3
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:01,727
to give you the moment
you've been waiting for

4
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:03,195
all summer long.

5
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:06,099
Two contestants remain,

6
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:08,501
but only one will be.

7
00:01:08,534 --> 00:01:10,837
<i>Married to a Millionaire.</i>

8
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:13,738
Well, it was just a couple
of months ago

9
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:16,375
that I asked your ten suitors
one question.

10
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:18,578
How far would you go
for the one you love?

11
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,448
Who do you want to spend
the rest of your life with?

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,184
Brandi or Jessica?

13
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:28,787
Jessica, we're just not made
for each other.

14
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,222
I've decided to go with Brandi!

15
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,524
Brandi!

16
00:01:31,557 --> 00:01:33,192
It's Brandi!

17
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:36,228
I am the happiest man alive.

18
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,829
And I'm the luckiest girl.

19
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:39,364
We'll take you down
to the church,

20
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:41,233
where both of your families
are waiting for you.

21
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,634
Come on.

22
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:48,573
No, no, no, no!

23
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:51,811
You slut!

24
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:53,646
What'd you do?
Suck his small dick?

25
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:54,647
No, hey!

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,449
Move!
- I'm not gonna do that!

27
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:59,719
Put the gun down.
Put it down!

28
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:01,620
Oh, my God!

29
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:03,789
Somebody get over here!

30
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:07,492
<i>...not sure
what happened there.</i>

31
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:09,360
<i>We will, of course, let you
know as soon as we find out.</i>

32
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:12,365
<i>Alex Jones here, reporting on the tragic
shooting death live on television.</i>

33
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:14,667
<i>Tragic news. BC's Married</i>
- to a Millionaire.

34
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,202
<i>- Two are reported dead...
- ...gunned down in front...</i>

35
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:20,338
<i>...Adam Rogers dove on top
to shield, an act of heroism...</i>

36
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:22,608
<i>...host Adam Rogers displayed
unbelievable bravery...</i>

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,276
<i>I'm remorseful, she was sick.</i>

38
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,513
Yeah, can you say it like
you mean it, please?

39
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,481
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:31,183
I'm remorseful, she was sick.

41
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,586
Nobody knew it.
- Good. You're a hero.

42
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:34,819
All right.
- You'll be fine.

43
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:37,557
Please welcome Adam Rogers.

44
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,893
Take your
hands out of your pockets!

45
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:45,364
How does it feel to be
a national hero?

46
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:49,868
Oh, uh... no,
I...

47
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,269
I'm no hero, I was just...

48
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,906
I was just doing what anybody would
have done under those circumstances.

49
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:56,241
Well, most people
would have ducked.

50
00:02:57,508 --> 00:02:59,477
Now, what was going
through your mind

51
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,615
when you first heard
the gunshots?

52
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:04,717
Honestly?

53
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,252
Yes, honestly.

54
00:03:06,284 --> 00:03:08,820
<i>We're all about honesty
on Morning Show USA.</i>

55
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,295
Honestly, I was thinking about...
my job,

56
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,866
and what a giant mess this
was gonna cause our network.

57
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,637
Here I was, lying next to a man
that had just been murdered

58
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:26,972
and all I could think
about was myself.

59
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,007
It was not your fault.

60
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:30,709
Actually, it was my fault.

61
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:33,912
And... it was your fault,

62
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:35,213
and it was our network's fault,

63
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:39,618
and it was the millions of people
who tune in each week's fault.

64
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:43,256
...bring us to top five
Tuesdays through Fridays.

65
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:45,590
I know you want to see
the numbers for your ads, so--

66
00:03:45,623 --> 00:03:48,561
There's a problem.

67
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:49,794
Excuse me for a moment.

68
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:50,997
Rogers is going rogue.

69
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,899
Director wants permission
to pull the plug.

70
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:57,335
We're sitting here
celebrating me...

71
00:03:57,368 --> 00:04:00,973
trying to cover the fact that we
pitted two women against each other

72
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:03,808
like a couple of fucking dogs.

73
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,278
Uh, right.

74
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:08,881
<i>What happened on my show,
that was not an accident.</i>

75
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:10,615
<i>That was...
that was inevitable.</i>

76
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,350
Okay, my little man.

77
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:14,887
Shh, quiet!

78
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,024
<i>There it is, a desperate rage
festering in this country</i>

79
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,824
<i>and we're too afraid
to show it to you.</i>

80
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,394
<i>Instead we numb ourselves</i>

81
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,796
<i>with our stupid fucking
morning shows</i>

82
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:27,800
<i>and soap operas
and reality shows.</i>

83
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,602
<i>- It's disgusting.
- Holy crap.</i>

84
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:31,504
Isn't that your brother?

85
00:04:31,536 --> 00:04:34,606
<i>I'm going to have to stop
you now, ok? That was--</i>

86
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,075
<i>I was told to come out here and
say that Jessica was sick...</i>

87
00:04:37,108 --> 00:04:39,444
<i>Yes. - And that it was just
a game, but I can't do that.</i>

88
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:40,745
<i>Jessica was not sick.</i>

89
00:04:40,778 --> 00:04:42,781
She was a beautiful human being

90
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:46,351
under an incredible amount
of pressure and personal debt

91
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:49,288
and we played with her heart
for our own financial gain.

92
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:53,091
<i>Okay, Adam, you know what?
That was great--</i>

93
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,060
<i>- Let it play out.
- I have to stop you now, okay?</i>

94
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:56,896
And I'm glad that
people saw that.

95
00:04:56,928 --> 00:05:00,332
That is the most reality
reality TV has ever shown

96
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:01,866
and I hope that we
show more of it.

97
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:04,402
Well, I guess you're
in the minority there.

98
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:07,339
We should show more of that.
- Okay, are we-- are we still live?

99
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:10,642
All right, we'll be right
back after these messages

100
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:13,378
with America's cutest puppies.

101
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:14,479
Thank you.

102
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:20,786
What the fuck, man?
- I'm sorry.

103
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:22,655
What he fuck are you doing?
- It was nice to meet you.

104
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,882
Hey.
- Hey.

105
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,817
I am so fucking fired.

106
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,052
Good.

107
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:54,120
You're too good for that job.

108
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,088
You should go back to school.
I'll help you study.

109
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,022
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

110
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:01,159
You got me back on my feet,
I'll get you back on your feet.

111
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:03,895
Yeah, I don't think so.

112
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:06,564
What the hell did I do?

113
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:07,699
What did I do?

114
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,139
You know what you did?

115
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,408
You told the truth, Adam.

116
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:19,945
I haven't seen that guy
in a long time.

117
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:21,913
I am proud of you.

118
00:06:21,947 --> 00:06:23,716
Mom and dad would have
been proud of you, too.

119
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,752
Yeah, I bet mom and dad
would have been real proud.

120
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:29,155
A TV hack and a
recovering pill-head.

121
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:30,757
It's Nurse Pill-Head
to you.

122
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:34,125
I'm going back to the hospital.
- I'm sorry.

123
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:36,161
It's okay, it's okay.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Hey.

124
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:39,865
How're you doing?
- I'm good.

125
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:42,568
Good.

126
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,737
Let me grab your...

127
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:47,739
What? No.
No, no, no.

128
00:06:47,773 --> 00:06:50,475
Adam, that's not what I'm here for.
- We had a deal.

129
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,845
You pay off your debt
and I pay your expenses.

130
00:06:52,877 --> 00:06:54,079
Hold on.
- No. Nope, not cool.

131
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:56,115
Hey, a deal's a deal. Come
here, come here, come here.

132
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:57,417
Take it.

133
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,189
Thank you.

134
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:04,656
You're welcome.
- I love you.

135
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,826
I love you, too, honey.

136
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:10,896
You're okay.

137
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,133
Say it again.

138
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:19,538
You're okay, Adam Rogers.
All right.

139
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,613
<i>Hey, this is Adam.
Leave a message please.</i>

140
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:29,215
<i>Ilana Katzenberg here.</i>

141
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:30,415
<i>Nice rant this morning.</i>

142
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:33,586
<i>Be at the network office
tomorrow, 9am sharp--</i>

143
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:46,197
It seems like we're working the
same hours, Miss Katzenberg.

144
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,634
Yeah, except I start
at 8:30 again.

145
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:54,039
Shoot.
Yeah, me too.

146
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:57,175
What's your name again?

147
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,146
Um, Mason.

148
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:03,048
Mason Washington, ma'am.

149
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:05,584
Two jobs.
- Yeah.

150
00:08:05,617 --> 00:08:07,620
And looking for a third.

151
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,289
You aren't hiring an appliance
salesman by any chance, are you?

152
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:11,423
No.

153
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:13,259
I was number one in the
South Bay, 15 years over.

154
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,926
"House to fill?
Just call Bill at--."

155
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,061
You worked at Angel
City Appliance!

156
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,799
You know it?
- I bought my fridge and stove there.

157
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,902
I was there for three decades.

158
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:26,838
Then online shopping came along,

159
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,607
and then the recession,

160
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,108
and now it seems that
nobody wants to hire

161
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,211
a 55-year-old
with insufferable charm.

162
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:34,913
I don't know why.

163
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,817
Uh, I should get back to work.

164
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:44,056
Do you watch television, Mason?

165
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,791
Me?

166
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,692
Oh, uh... no,
not much, honestly.

167
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:49,260
<i>How about Married
to a Millionaire?</i>

168
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:50,361
No, ma'am.

169
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:54,567
<i>But my son did show me the
video on Morning USA.</i>

170
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,935
Oh, so you know what happened?

171
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,536
Yeah.
- So what do you think?

172
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:00,305
You can't fire me, can you?

173
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,309
Probably.
But I won't.

174
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,312
I think he was
speaking the truth.

175
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,749
You don't see too much
of that lately.

176
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:13,019
I agree.

177
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,360
Jerry.

178
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,629
Jerry, please.
Look. Look.

179
00:09:23,662 --> 00:09:25,163
I know we talked about this,

180
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,231
but I'm four hours away
from being full-time.

181
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:29,516
I can do the hours
anywhere you want.

182
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:32,037
West end, downtown, Valley,
Orange County, I don't care.

183
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,340
You know how badly my family
needs the health benefits.

184
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,742
I'm sorry, but I've got
no more hours to give.

185
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:38,343
All right?
We're stretched thin.

186
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,579
We can't be stretched that thin.

187
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,719
All right.

188
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,120
G'night.

189
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,699
Shit.

190
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,148
<i>How about this Adam Rogers?</i>

191
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:50,682
<i>What a story, I tell you--</i>

192
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:55,820
Daddy!

193
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:57,855
'Morning, angel.

194
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:59,191
Did you get
a good night's sleep?

195
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:00,392
Did you eat your breakfast?

196
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:01,826
Did you brush your teeth?

197
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,329
Oooh...
Uh-uh, you fibber!

198
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:08,166
Hey, go brush your teeth. Daddy
will drive you to school.

199
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,169
Hey, watch yourself,
you little twerp.

200
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,403
Derrick called me a twerp!

201
00:11:11,436 --> 00:11:13,673
Yeah, I heard him.
He'll apologize.

202
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,775
'Morning, slugger.

203
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:20,445
Who were those suits
at the door?

204
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,980
Derrick, grab your breakfast.

205
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:25,850
Your dad will drive you
to school.

206
00:11:53,144 --> 00:11:56,781
What happened on your show
this week was disastrous.

207
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:58,917
But-- but,

208
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,287
from a legal standpoint,
surprisingly neither the network

209
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,424
nor the producers
could be held liable.

210
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:07,960
Yeah, I know.
But here's the thing.

211
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:11,430
When it comes to the murder,
the FCC allows live broadcasts

212
00:12:11,462 --> 00:12:14,098
to air unforeseen
criminal content

213
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:17,001
as long as it wasn't planned,
there was security in place,

214
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,270
and every effort was made
to kill the feed.

215
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:20,505
All of which we can prove.

216
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:22,473
When it comes to the suicide,

217
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:23,942
that's where it gets
a little interesting.

218
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,846
Oh, I'm sorry.
- I must have the wrong-- - Sit, Sylvia.

219
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,214
Everyone, this is
Sylvia Rowland,

220
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:32,850
three-time Emmy-winning producer
of our live broadcast

221
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:35,486
<i>of Snow White, Peter Pan
and The Wizard.</i>

222
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,456
Sylvia, everyone.
Continue.

223
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:40,793
As I was saying, when it
comes to Jessica's suicide,

224
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,927
a case could be made

225
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,861
that no one tried to stop her
from killing herself.

226
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:46,965
A small one, I know,
but a case nonetheless.

227
00:12:46,998 --> 00:12:48,867
But unlike murder,

228
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:51,336
suicide is not a felony
in the United States.

229
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:55,340
So therefore, if we can prove
that no one did anything

230
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:57,376
to aid or abet her
in her actions,

231
00:12:57,408 --> 00:13:00,144
we are off the hook.

232
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:01,980
I, uh-- I have a question,
Bernie.

233
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:04,283
Forget the murder for a second.

234
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,185
What if we hypothetically knew

235
00:13:06,217 --> 00:13:08,486
Jessica was gonna
commit suicide on air?

236
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:12,024
Well, hypothetically, if we knew
she was gonna kill herself

237
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:14,860
and no one did anything
to aid or abet her--

238
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:17,329
You mean by handing her the gun?

239
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:18,629
Yeah, correct.

240
00:13:18,663 --> 00:13:21,533
Unless, of course, there was a
physician on hand doing it.

241
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,434
Well, yes.

242
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:25,870
Suicide law is
a state-by-state issue.

243
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:28,539
I mean, in California
the End of Life Option Act

244
00:13:28,572 --> 00:13:31,275
allows physicians
to supervise people

245
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:34,379
who are deemed mentally sound to
take their own lives.

246
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:36,248
At first it was just
for the terminally ill,

247
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,315
but...
- But?

248
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:40,018
But there was a constitutional
challenge this year.

249
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:42,421
Proposition 426.

250
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:45,122
Now all you have to be
is mentally sound

251
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:47,191
and you can kill yourself
any way you deem fit.

252
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:48,393
So, theoretically,

253
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:51,028
if we had a show on air where
people committed suicide,

254
00:13:51,062 --> 00:13:53,465
and we had a doctor, let's say
a psychiatrist, on hand,

255
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:55,234
we wouldn't be breaking the law.

256
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,335
Are you actually being
serious right now?

257
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,637
All right, I'm sorry,
but can I ask why I'm here?

258
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:01,906
Ilana, are we talking
theoretics here or actual?

259
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,076
Because if we're talking actual,

260
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:07,079
as your legal counsel I strongly
advise you against pursuing this.

261
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,514
I mean, the FCC
will have a field day!

262
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,183
Not if you put it on
after 10 o'clock, right?

263
00:14:12,216 --> 00:14:13,552
Jesus Christ.

264
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:15,254
I thought I was coming here
to get fired today.

265
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,189
Yeah, and I thought I was
coming here to pitch a show.

266
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:20,292
Everyone, go.
Adam, Sylvia, stay.

267
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,460
Thank you, Bernie.

268
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:25,630
All right, let's go.

269
00:14:27,197 --> 00:14:29,134
All right, I'm sorry, but
you can't be serious.

270
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,569
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised.

271
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:34,639
Adam, you caused quite a
stir in this country.

272
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:38,043
Your heroics combined with
your oratorical prowess

273
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:39,610
made us the number one network

274
00:14:39,644 --> 00:14:42,246
for the first time
in two decades.

275
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,380
As president of
network programming,

276
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:46,384
it's my job to make sure you
aren't a flash in the pan.

277
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:49,520
By watching people
kill themselves on national TV?

278
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:52,690
Are you out of your mind?
- Thank you!

279
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:56,228
And Sylvia, you are the best
live producer in the world.

280
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,164
We are fortunate enough to contractually
have you for one more show.

281
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:02,167
Yes, a live theatrical show.

282
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,669
Not a live death porn show.

283
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,570
Well, actually your
contract defines "show"

284
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:07,338
as single or event series.

285
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:10,074
This qualifies
as an event series.

286
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:11,542
Oh, I'm sorry, but...

287
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:15,279
Fuck you, and fuck this.

288
00:15:15,312 --> 00:15:17,649
You're under contract, Sylvia.

289
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:20,018
What are you doing?

290
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:23,522
Don't worry about her,
she'll come around.

291
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:25,156
The question is:
Will you?

292
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,126
You're too good for this
network, Adam, I know.

293
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:32,096
<i>We're in the shmattah business
and you're done with that.</i>

294
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:34,298
I also realize that on the
surface this sounds like a--

295
00:15:34,331 --> 00:15:35,701
Like a gimmick.

296
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,302
But I want you to know

297
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:40,405
that everything you said
yesterday was true.

298
00:15:40,437 --> 00:15:43,574
People are angry.
They're fed up.

299
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:45,443
They wanna see something real.

300
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:49,380
So, let's show them
something real.

301
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,387
I just watched two people
die in front of me.

302
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:57,621
I prefer not to see
any more of that.

303
00:15:57,654 --> 00:15:59,158
Have a nice day.

304
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,402
How'd the interview go?

305
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,275
Extraordinary.

306
00:16:17,307 --> 00:16:19,444
They hired a 20-year-old.

307
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,014
Oh, Mason.

308
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,049
Oh, you know, it's all right.

309
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:27,318
I mean, it wasn't meant
for me anyway.

310
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:28,687
Those men that came
to the house.

311
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,622
They're from the bank.

312
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:33,125
You told me we were a bit
behind on the mortgage,

313
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,728
but you didn't tell me
we were five months behind.

314
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,331
They can come and take our
house any time they want,

315
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:40,232
you know that, right?

316
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:42,167
Rebecca--
- And it's not just them.

317
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,269
Collectors been calling
every day, Mason.

318
00:16:44,302 --> 00:16:46,204
So don't pick up.
- I'm not pickin' up!

319
00:16:46,236 --> 00:16:47,371
Look, what do you
want me to say?

320
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:49,707
I'm paying the water bills,
I'm paying the electric bills,

321
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,509
I'm payin' for gas,
I'm payin' for insurance,

322
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,245
I'm trying to pay
for Derrick's medical,

323
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,678
and I'm payin' for groceries.

324
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:56,581
Are you done?

325
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:59,418
'Cause I gotta go to work to
help pay for everything else.

326
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,388
The clothing, the books,
the birthday presents.

327
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,826
We worked so hard
to get our kids

328
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,529
into a good neighborhood
with a good school district.

329
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:16,567
<i>I am not gonna let that
be taken away from them.</i>

330
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,247
<i>...more than Indiana,
the condition of compuls--</i>

331
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,549
<i>...go back to France, because 99
percent of the country hates you!</i>

332
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,817
<i>...accept that,
that's fine.</i>

333
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,120
<i>I think it's stupid
what you're saying.</i>

334
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:37,655
<i>So what I'm gonna do is
I'm going to accept it.</i>

335
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:38,990
<i>But FOX News has been right!</i>

336
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:40,625
<i>Yeah, I just didn't
think people wanted a dialogue.</i>

337
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:44,129
<i>No, no, no. That's fine, right?
I mean, am I right?</i>

338
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:47,164
<i>Are we at the presidential
level, or is he punching down?</i>

339
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:49,367
<i>Welcome to the season premiere
of Married to a Millionaire.</i>

340
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,401
<i>My name is Adam Rogers</i>

341
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:53,337
<i>and we have just met
our wealthy man.</i>

342
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:56,208
<i>Why don't we meet our suitors?
Hi, what's your name?</i>

343
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,677
<i>Hi, I'm Jessica,
I'm a dental hygienist.</i>

344
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:03,615
<i>I love writing, swimming,
and romantic dinners.</i>

345
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,750
<i>- Okay. And your name?
- Hi, I'm Brandi, I'm a physiotherapist.</i>

346
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:09,488
<i>I like traveling, surfing,
and hot dogs.</i>

347
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,890
<i>Okay. Hot dogs.
I like hot dogs.</i>

348
00:18:12,923 --> 00:18:14,625
<i>- Only vegan.
- Okay.</i>

349
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:15,927
<i>Brandi, Jessica,</i>

350
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:18,730
<i>do you feel like you're
marriage material for John?</i>

351
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:21,532
<i>- Hell yeah!
- Fuck.</i>

352
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:35,546
<i>Brandi!</i>

353
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:41,619
<i>Move!</i>

354
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:18,416
How are you?

355
00:20:18,449 --> 00:20:21,720
Uh, she can't see you right now.

356
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:24,021
Uh, look. She's--
Hey. Cut me a break, man.

357
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:25,789
I can't let you in there--
- Just give me a second.

358
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:28,393
I'm telling you,
you can't--

359
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:33,431
I'm done exploiting people
for the sake of ratings,

360
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:35,933
and I am done being the
mouthpiece for garbage.

361
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,935
<i>Excuse me?</i>

362
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:38,903
<i>Ilana, what's going on
over there?</i>

363
00:20:38,935 --> 00:20:40,605
I'm on a call with our entire
board of directors.

364
00:20:40,637 --> 00:20:41,807
Can this wait?

365
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,581
I don't wanna do a show
that affirms death.

366
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:50,682
We gotta do better than that.

367
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:52,283
I wanna do a show
that affirms life,

368
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,919
that challenges people,
that stands for something.

369
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:57,421
Okay.

370
00:20:57,454 --> 00:21:00,357
But people will die if we go
ahead with this, you know.

371
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:01,459
Yeah, I know.

372
00:21:01,491 --> 00:21:04,561
But I don't want them
dying in vain.

373
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:07,432
Now if...
if I do this show,

374
00:21:07,464 --> 00:21:09,900
and if people are
actually going to die,

375
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,502
I want them to die
for a good reason,

376
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,703
a higher purpose.

377
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:15,774
I want this show to teach
people how to live,

378
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,608
to appreciate what we've got,

379
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:20,312
to foster empathy.

380
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,579
And it's not gonna be
about fame or money,

381
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:25,583
and we are not gonna be
bribing guests to come on.

382
00:21:25,615 --> 00:21:27,585
They will come
of their own volition.

383
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:29,486
And if that doesn't work?

384
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,990
Everybody has a story,
they just...

385
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:34,625
they just want to be heard.

386
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,728
What do you want?

387
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,530
I want a say in set design
and show structure,

388
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,599
and I want complete control
of the message--

389
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:44,736
Adam--
- It's non-negotiable.

390
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:46,938
You're using me.

391
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,574
And I want to be perfectly clear

392
00:21:49,606 --> 00:21:51,710
that I'm gonna be
using you, too.

393
00:21:53,377 --> 00:21:55,879
You need ratings.
I need a platform.

394
00:21:55,913 --> 00:21:58,950
This is not gonna be
a circus act, Ilana.

395
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:00,951
This is gonna be shocking.

396
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:03,687
And real.

397
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:05,390
And it'll probably
get us both fired.

398
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:10,695
Sounds good to me.

399
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,832
Okay.

400
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:19,604
Let's move these LED walls
downstage and put in the stairs,

401
00:22:19,636 --> 00:22:22,374
and bring the five-line
up in the service.

402
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:29,646
And hey, let's-- let's bring
these seats all the way...

403
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,781
all the way up to here.

404
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:32,817
I wanna feel the audience
right on top of the stage.

405
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:35,119
Where will the cameras go?

406
00:22:36,586 --> 00:22:37,922
I'm gonna need at least ten feet

407
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:40,424
for three operators
and a jib arm.

408
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,694
Plus do you think they're gonna let
someone walk on stage with a gun,

409
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:44,496
no barrier
to the audience? No.

410
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:46,765
You're gonna need a bullet-proof
partition built around the stage

411
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,633
and I want separate entrances
from the parking lot,

412
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:50,934
so no one behind that wall
can get into the audience.

413
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:53,037
Who is in charge here?
You or him?

414
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:55,773
I am.

415
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:56,908
I am.

416
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:59,109
It's not about death,
but it is about ratings.

417
00:22:59,143 --> 00:23:02,646
The idea here is
to have people wake up.

418
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:06,717
He looks like a serial killer.

419
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,086
Do we need serial killer?

420
00:23:08,118 --> 00:23:09,586
Well, he can serial
kill himself.

421
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:11,855
We're making this
network relevant.

422
00:23:11,888 --> 00:23:12,656
You cannot forget.

423
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,692
Can we order some pizza, please?

424
00:23:14,724 --> 00:23:18,663
This is where I wanna start,
what's next... nope.

425
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,932
And we're gonna need to work
on these screens here, right?

426
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,716
What are we doing here?

427
00:23:38,749 --> 00:23:40,151
What are we doing here?
- Mm-hmm.

428
00:23:40,183 --> 00:23:43,721
Uh... we're making a show.

429
00:23:43,753 --> 00:23:45,589
You know what I mean.

430
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:49,493
We're giving television the
kick in the ass that it needs.

431
00:23:49,527 --> 00:23:50,694
That's what we're doing here.

432
00:23:50,728 --> 00:23:53,131
We're challenging people to get
up and stand for something.

433
00:23:53,163 --> 00:23:54,499
And what is that? Death?

434
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:57,868
No. No, Sylvia.
Life.

435
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:03,641
It's not just a show
about death.

436
00:24:03,673 --> 00:24:05,943
<i>You do know that no one
at the network</i>

437
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:09,147
gives a shit about your message, right?
- Yeah.

438
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,116
They just want shock and awe
and blood and pyrotechnics.

439
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,384
Yeah, I know. I know,

440
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:18,756
but I think that we can create a
scenario where everybody wins.

441
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,526
God, I want to believe you.

442
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:23,861
You know, for a reality
show veteran,

443
00:24:23,894 --> 00:24:26,698
you are impressively naive.

444
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:31,502
Yeah? Well, for a woman who
tells fairytales for a living,

445
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:33,671
your lack of imagination
is quite sad.

446
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:38,977
Knock 'em dead, kiddo.

447
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,779
Really?

448
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:44,215
Let's have a good show,
everybody.

449
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:46,518
Stand by VTU.

450
00:24:48,885 --> 00:24:52,057
On in five, four, three...

451
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:56,895
Cue graphics and music.
Cue camera one.

452
00:24:58,095 --> 00:25:02,600
<i>Live from Los Angeles,
This Is Your Death!</i>

453
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:06,738
<i>And now, your host, Adam Rogers!</i>

454
00:25:09,773 --> 00:25:13,577
Ladies and gentlemen...

455
00:25:13,611 --> 00:25:16,281
What you're about to see tonight

456
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:18,917
is unlike anything you've seen
on television before.

457
00:25:20,617 --> 00:25:24,655
But let me be clear about
one thing straight off the top.

458
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,660
This is not a stunt,
this is not a joke-

459
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:29,993
He's off script.
Hold the prompter.

460
00:25:30,027 --> 00:25:32,197
This is not a prank.

461
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:39,304
And this will probably
shock you, and that's okay.

462
00:25:39,336 --> 00:25:42,307
Because on this show
we're all about transparency.

463
00:25:44,008 --> 00:25:46,210
Now, despite what most
networks want you to believe,

464
00:25:46,242 --> 00:25:48,745
your television is not there to
coddle you,

465
00:25:48,778 --> 00:25:50,847
nor is it there to provide
mindless escapism.

466
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:53,317
What is going on?
- He's ad-libbing, is what's going on.

467
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,687
Is this a surprise?
- All right, get me in his ear.

468
00:25:57,954 --> 00:25:59,691
Adam, get on script.

469
00:25:59,723 --> 00:26:02,759
<i>It's a liability issue and we
signed off on the warning.</i>

470
00:26:02,792 --> 00:26:03,960
Long before the Internet...

471
00:26:03,993 --> 00:26:06,063
Okay, he's moving. Let's follow him.
- Your TV...

472
00:26:06,096 --> 00:26:09,267
Son of a bitch.
- Was invented to connect us,

473
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:10,335
to bring us together,

474
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:13,771
to create a shared communal
experience, and now...

475
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,043
<i>now all it does is lie to you.</i>

476
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,778
<i>But we're about to change
that tonight.</i>

477
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:27,217
Cue audience applause.

478
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:34,024
I could explain to you what's
gonna happen next, but it's...

479
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:35,859
it's probably best
just to show you.

480
00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:39,230
Introducing our first guest
ever...

481
00:26:39,262 --> 00:26:41,198
<i>- This is Sara Hickey.
- Cue VCR.</i>

482
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:43,267
From Hope Township, New Jersey.
Have a look.

483
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,870
<i>Stage lights.</i>

484
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:50,107
<i>I married Bill
when I was very young.</i>

485
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:53,076
<i>He was sweet and charming,</i>

486
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:55,979
<i>told funny jokes.</i>

487
00:26:56,012 --> 00:26:58,148
<i>He reminded me of my father.</i>

488
00:26:59,983 --> 00:27:02,086
<i>Which was probably a bad thing.</i>

489
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:07,024
<i>It wasn't long before Bill
became violent towards me.</i>

490
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,961
<i>But things got much worse...</i>

491
00:27:14,464 --> 00:27:19,303
<i>when Bill began
molesting Emily...</i>

492
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,842
<i>our daughter.</i>

493
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:29,146
<i>I tried leaving him, trust me.</i>

494
00:27:30,948 --> 00:27:33,018
<i>It's impossible when there's
no money for a new life.</i>

495
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:38,789
<i>But I'll know that
I made an effort</i>

496
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,926
<i>to rescue my little girl.</i>

497
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:44,229
<i>How will
your suicide rescue her?</i>

498
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,399
<i>You'll see.</i>

499
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,902
<i>Cue applause.</i>

500
00:27:52,936 --> 00:27:55,072
Ladies and gentlemen.

501
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:57,942
After tonight,

502
00:27:57,974 --> 00:28:00,844
Sara Hickey ill never have
a chance at a new life.

503
00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:06,250
But her daughter could.

504
00:28:08,885 --> 00:28:10,221
With your aid.

505
00:28:11,955 --> 00:28:15,959
If you'd like to donate money
to Emily Hickey,

506
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:18,829
please text the number that
will soon appear on your screen.

507
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,265
Number? We don't-- we don't have a number.
We never discussed this.

508
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:24,067
Relax, we got a text system
set up for our talent shows.

509
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:25,002
Call the networks.

510
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,071
Tell them to turn on premium.
- Copy that.

511
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:30,208
All proceeds will be matched
by the WBC network

512
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,809
up to $100,000.

513
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:35,980
Fuck off!
That's not true!

514
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:37,081
It is now.

515
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,284
Ladies and gentlemen,

516
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:43,354
let's show Sara Hickey
that her sacrifice tonight

517
00:28:43,386 --> 00:28:46,022
won't be in vain.

518
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:54,499
Cue on one.
- Yes, sir.

519
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,201
House lights fade.

520
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:35,839
Yeah.

521
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:37,575
What if she chickens out?

522
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:39,810
<i>We play as a redemption story,</i>

523
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:43,014
okay? Oh, and by the way,
great work on that video.

524
00:29:43,047 --> 00:29:44,414
All right, now please
let me watch this.

525
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:56,326
It is lights out, my prince.

526
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,998
What the fuck?

527
00:31:23,547 --> 00:31:24,515
Oh, come on.

528
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:25,883
Keller, play the emotions.

529
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:28,051
Zack, how much money did we raise so far?
- Start on three.

530
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:29,519
$29...
no, $30,000.

531
00:31:36,593 --> 00:31:37,561
Show me the audience.

532
00:31:37,594 --> 00:31:38,662
Give me a close-up on 2.
- $45,000.

533
00:31:38,694 --> 00:31:41,097
Should I play redemptive music?
- No. Adam,

534
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:42,500
<i>don't come out yet.</i>

535
00:31:42,532 --> 00:31:44,334
Okay, okay.
Okay, I'll wait.

536
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:47,337
Emily.

537
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:49,373
I'm doing this for you.

538
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:50,642
I'm sorry.

539
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,979
I don't want to rot in jail
for the rest of your life.

540
00:31:58,115 --> 00:32:01,986
They'll find your dad's body
in our garage.

541
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:10,327
Oh!

542
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,564
She did it.
Good girl.

543
00:32:13,596 --> 00:32:15,432
Pull out! Jesus
Christ, pull out!

544
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:16,967
Flicker the lights.

545
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:54,504
<i>Thank you for watching
This Is Your Death.</i>

546
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:58,708
Life is precious.

547
00:32:58,741 --> 00:33:01,077
Make the most of it.

548
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:02,380
See you next week.

549
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,673
And... cut to commercial.

550
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,754
Everyone's phones still off?

551
00:33:44,788 --> 00:33:47,223
Yeah.

552
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:48,558
Congratulations.

553
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:51,295
You just cost the
network $100,000.

554
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:52,328
We raised $100,000?

555
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:54,298
$200,000 actually.

556
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,132
But we only had to
match up to $100,000.

557
00:33:56,165 --> 00:33:59,803
Wait, wait, wait. So we just
gave that girl $300,000?

558
00:33:59,836 --> 00:34:02,440
Yes.
- Wow!

559
00:34:02,472 --> 00:34:03,574
That's good!

560
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:06,309
Is this show now about money?

561
00:34:06,343 --> 00:34:09,547
No, this is a show about giving
girls like that a future.

562
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:11,181
By killing her mother.

563
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:12,682
Sara died of her own volition

564
00:34:12,715 --> 00:34:15,219
after consulting a trained
psychiatrist and physician,

565
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:17,822
and, because of it, she bettered
the life of her daughter.

566
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,423
That's right.

567
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:20,423
By killing herself.

568
00:34:20,456 --> 00:34:22,559
No, by showing people
that not everybody on TV

569
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,395
is rich and pretty
and living the American dream.

570
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:27,164
By killing herself.

571
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:29,467
Yes, Sylvia, by killing herself.

572
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,369
Look, not everything in this
world deserves a happy ending.

573
00:34:32,402 --> 00:34:35,139
Sophocles knew this.
Euripides knew this.

574
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:37,108
Shakespeare knew this.
Milton, Beckett...

575
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:38,843
What-- what're you doing?

576
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:40,011
Looking to see

577
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:42,480
if you secretly have Wikipedia
open on your phone.

578
00:34:46,916 --> 00:34:48,184
Uh, shots anyone?

579
00:34:48,217 --> 00:34:49,219
Yes.
- Yeah.

580
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,528
Hey, good news.
I found you more hours.

581
00:34:58,561 --> 00:35:00,563
Really?
Thank you.

582
00:35:00,597 --> 00:35:02,600
Hey, I appreciate it.
- Yeah, no problem.

583
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:05,869
It's three hours a night in Riverside.
It starts at 2:30am.

584
00:35:05,902 --> 00:35:07,770
Woah, Jerry, wait.
2:30?

585
00:35:07,804 --> 00:35:09,673
I-I finish here at 2:00.

586
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:12,376
I can't make it from Century
City to Riverside in 30 minutes.

587
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:13,744
It takes 75 minutes, no traffic.

588
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:15,713
Sorry, man.
Take it or leave it.

589
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:16,881
No, no--
Woah, woah, woah.

590
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:19,450
Jerry, if I take it and I'm
late, you're gonna fire me.

591
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:20,985
Hey, look.
I'll tell you what.

592
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,220
Why don't I get there at 3:00 and I go
till 6:00? I'll speed as fast as I can.

593
00:35:23,253 --> 00:35:24,922
No. No can do.
It's a finance office.

594
00:35:24,954 --> 00:35:26,489
They come into work at 5:30.

595
00:35:26,523 --> 00:35:30,361
Well, I'm sorry, then.
I can't take it.

596
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:35,698
Well, I, too, am sorry.

597
00:35:35,731 --> 00:35:39,536
QMB Janitorial Corporation will
no longer need your services.

598
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,739
We'll send you your final
two paychecks by mail.

599
00:35:41,771 --> 00:35:43,740
Wait-- no, no--
Come on, Jerry!

600
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:44,875
Look, come on, I'm never late,

601
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:46,442
I work harder than
everyone else!

602
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:47,612
Why are you settin' me up?

603
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:50,547
Is this about the benefits?

604
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:52,316
Look-- look, forget
I even asked.

605
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:54,852
Look, I don't care about the benefits.
Forget it.

606
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:57,788
Jerry? Jerry! Jerry!

607
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,335
What you're doing is barbaric.

608
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:15,772
I thought you stood
for something.

609
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,576
Thank you.
I appreciate your...

610
00:36:18,608 --> 00:36:21,511
input. Asshole.

611
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,317
Oh, no. Did you turn on
your phone?

612
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:29,987
Uh, no. No, I'm, uh... I'm good.

613
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:31,722
Uh, why don't we get outta here?

614
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:33,423
Ah, yeah.

615
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:36,359
I'm not like that, okay?
I'll drop you off.

616
00:36:36,393 --> 00:36:38,896
That's okay, I can get
my own Uber. Thank you.

617
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:40,831
We can Uber together.
Let's Uber pool.

618
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:43,601
It's cheap, and we may not
have jobs tomorrow, so...

619
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,336
You know nothing about me.

620
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,604
That's not true!

621
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:47,838
I know you're from Cleveland.

622
00:36:47,871 --> 00:36:48,639
Oh.

623
00:36:48,672 --> 00:36:50,907
And I know you're an only child.

624
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,576
And I know that you would
rather be living in New York,

625
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,947
but Broadway is your
ex-husband's domain,

626
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,250
so here you are,
slumming it on TV.

627
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:01,951
Well, my, uh, my panties
are sopping wet.

628
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:03,153
I'm not finished.

629
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:05,556
I know that you eat too much
kale for your own good,

630
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:08,791
and I know that you think that
real men don't drink white wine,

631
00:37:08,824 --> 00:37:11,294
but I don't really give
a shit because I love it.

632
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:19,704
And I also know that, like me...

633
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,776
you just want to make
something meaningful and lasting

634
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:28,479
in this screwed up,

635
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:32,816
swipe right, shit-for-brains
world we live in.

636
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:33,884
How am I doing?

637
00:37:37,086 --> 00:37:40,423
You might just be the smartest
idiot that I've ever met.

638
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:41,391
Really?
- Mm-hmm.

639
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,826
Yeah, well, I did go
to Yale for two years.

640
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:43,826
Did you?
- Yeah.

641
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,829
Why did you drop out?

642
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:49,700
Wouldn't you like to know?
- Mm-hmm.

643
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,536
Let's go.

644
00:37:52,568 --> 00:37:53,871
This is not a yes.

645
00:37:53,903 --> 00:37:56,507
I never said it was a yes.

646
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:57,842
O... kay.

647
00:38:10,686 --> 00:38:12,088
Excuse me, sir.

648
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:15,826
Uh, the dishwasher
you've got, the old guy?

649
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:16,994
He's a real dick.

650
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:20,630
Him.

651
00:38:20,664 --> 00:38:23,334
<i>A new show aired
on the WBC network last night.</i>

652
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:27,403
The incredible thing is the show
seemingly came out of nowhere.

653
00:38:27,436 --> 00:38:30,007
No press, no advertising, nada.

654
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:32,675
<i>Now, if it turns out to be real,</i>

655
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:35,978
<i>WBC is gonna have a lot
to answer for.</i>

656
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:37,881
Just take a look
at our Facebook page.

657
00:38:37,914 --> 00:38:40,384
People are enraged.

658
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,653
<i>I'm taking callers.
First up, Ne--</i>

659
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:49,625
Holy shit.

660
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:53,530
Okay, okay!

661
00:38:53,563 --> 00:38:56,400
Hey, hey, hey!

662
00:38:56,432 --> 00:38:57,434
Karina, what the f-

663
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,435
Now I know why you've
been hiding from me.

664
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:00,804
Uh, can we talk about
this later, please?

665
00:39:00,836 --> 00:39:02,739
You told me that you
were getting out.

666
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:04,675
I did get out. This is
not a reality show.

667
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:05,843
No shit, it's worse.

668
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,644
Can we-- can we-- seriously.
- No, no, no, no.

669
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:09,445
Everybody at work knows
that I'm your sister.

670
00:39:09,478 --> 00:39:12,715
I don't-- you-- you can't
fucking do this to me!

671
00:39:12,748 --> 00:39:14,884
What? I'm not-- this is not about you.
- Are you kidding me?

672
00:39:14,918 --> 00:39:16,086
Adam, have you got my phone?

673
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:18,789
Oh, I'm... sorry.

674
00:39:18,822 --> 00:39:22,826
Hey. Uh, uh, Sylvia, this is
my sister, Karina.

675
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:24,460
Karina, Sylvia.

676
00:39:24,494 --> 00:39:25,496
Hi.

677
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,732
Hi. Girlfriend?

678
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:29,732
Yeah.
- No.

679
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:32,970
No, no.
I am his producer

680
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:37,408
and this was a drunken decision.

681
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,643
Come on.
Transparency, right?

682
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:41,177
Sylvia, I don't like your show.

683
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:42,645
Oh, neither do I.

684
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:43,914
Trust me.

685
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:47,751
Okay.

686
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:50,153
I like her, Adam.
Don't fuck it up.

687
00:39:50,186 --> 00:39:51,788
Thanks for your input.

688
00:39:54,623 --> 00:39:55,625
Shut up.

689
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:57,494
<i>Our country has never been</i>

690
00:39:57,527 --> 00:39:59,195
<i>more politically
or socially fractured.</i>

691
00:39:59,228 --> 00:40:02,465
<i>People watch and read
the news they agree with.</i>

692
00:40:02,498 --> 00:40:05,501
<i>There's no dissenting
opinion anymore.</i>

693
00:40:05,534 --> 00:40:08,538
<i>There's no honest debate.
It's just theatrics.</i>

694
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:09,974
<i>This whole show is theatrics.</i>

695
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,842
<i>Wait a second. Are you
talking about our show or theirs?</i>

696
00:40:12,876 --> 00:40:15,446
Hi, daddy.
How was work?

697
00:40:15,478 --> 00:40:17,747
It was fantastic.
How was your sleep?

698
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,049
They cut our cable
and internet last night.

699
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,218
I see.

700
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:24,488
Well, more time to read, hit
the books and study, right?

701
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:25,489
Dad, is everything o--

702
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:27,824
Hey, you got any tests today?

703
00:40:30,827 --> 00:40:32,563
History.
- Are you ready?

704
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,630
Of course, but can we--

705
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:35,899
Who was the 16th president
of the United States?

706
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:37,000
Abe Lincoln, but--

707
00:40:37,032 --> 00:40:38,534
And who was the 17th?

708
00:40:38,568 --> 00:40:41,071
I don't know. My test
is on the Civil War.

709
00:40:41,103 --> 00:40:42,304
So what?

710
00:40:42,338 --> 00:40:45,107
The future president's gotta know
all his predecessors, right?

711
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:48,711
I guess so.

712
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,617
<i>...salacious,
and downright unconscionable.</i>

713
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,219
<i>Not only should it be taken
off the air,</i>

714
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:57,888
<i>the creator should be jailed!</i>

715
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,088
<i>Oh, come on now.</i>

716
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:01,692
<i>It's provocative, yes,</i>

717
00:41:01,724 --> 00:41:05,027
<i>but what if we take Adam Rogers
seriously for a moment?</i>

718
00:41:05,061 --> 00:41:06,028
<i>What if he's right?</i>

719
00:41:06,061 --> 00:41:09,599
<i>What if this show is exactly
what we need--</i>

720
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,134
All right, little man.

721
00:41:11,166 --> 00:41:12,668
I'm gonna prep you for surgery.

722
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:15,038
Last check-up before I go.

723
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,507
How are you feeling?
You still nauseous?

724
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,776
I'm fine, but the news
has been crapping

725
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:22,546
all over your brother
this morning.

726
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:24,715
I don't want you watching that garbage.
You're too young.

727
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:27,684
Please.
I'm as mature as you.

728
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:28,719
Funny man, huh?

729
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:35,259
You're not gonna worry, right?
Routine procedure.

730
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,860
That's what they always say.

731
00:41:37,893 --> 00:41:40,696
You're gonna be just fine.
- That too.

732
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,934
But my favorite one
is "you're so strong".

733
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:51,975
It's the water commission.

734
00:41:52,007 --> 00:41:53,943
They call at 9:00,
right after the cable company,

735
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:56,980
who won't be calling no more
'cause it's shut down.

736
00:41:57,012 --> 00:41:59,083
I lost my job.

737
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:01,985
Which one?

738
00:42:03,586 --> 00:42:04,588
Both of them.

739
00:42:07,356 --> 00:42:09,293
Dare I ask why?

740
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,661
Does it matter?

741
00:42:13,896 --> 00:42:17,134
Okay. Okay, I can
pick up the slack.

742
00:42:18,601 --> 00:42:20,170
I'll try to get some
more hours at the hotel

743
00:42:20,202 --> 00:42:21,838
and I'll join Mary Kay.

744
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:23,240
I can sew--
- Rebecca.

745
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:25,842
I can sell Tupperware,
I can sell vitamins--

746
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:28,110
Rebecca, I'm not giving up.
- I know.

747
00:42:28,143 --> 00:42:30,947
But I don't think you
understand what I'm saying.

748
00:42:34,117 --> 00:42:37,754
You lose this house
and you lose us.

749
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:46,663
Hello, this is Mason Washington.
The money's coming.

750
00:42:46,695 --> 00:42:48,764
I appreciate your patience.
Thank you.

751
00:42:50,132 --> 00:42:53,636
We quintupled our audience twice
over from beginning to end,

752
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,938
and that's not even counting
plus three and plus five.

753
00:42:55,972 --> 00:42:58,075
Does this mean that we're number--
- Number three.

754
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,911
Behind NBC and CBS, but still.

755
00:43:00,943 --> 00:43:03,313
With no press, no promotion?
Not bad.

756
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:04,947
We're gonna be
number one next week.

757
00:43:04,981 --> 00:43:06,683
That's a ten million
viewer jump.

758
00:43:06,715 --> 00:43:08,652
Yeah, I understand
ratings share.

759
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,788
Holy shit.
- All right, hot shot.

760
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,956
Here's my concern.

761
00:43:14,157 --> 00:43:17,627
People are going to tire of
giving contestants pity money.

762
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,028
Okay, first of all,
they're not contestants,

763
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:20,896
and it's not pity money.
- Oh, you know what I mean.

764
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:23,666
We are giving our audience
the power to enact change,

765
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:26,068
to empathize with the
people they relate to.

766
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:27,403
It's not gonna get
too old, too fast.

767
00:43:27,436 --> 00:43:29,172
Oh, yeah, it will.
Trust me.

768
00:43:29,204 --> 00:43:32,241
You created an event.
We need a show.

769
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:34,177
We'll just bring
more people on each week.

770
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,746
We'll pick up the pace.
- Done.

771
00:43:35,778 --> 00:43:38,047
But that doesn't address
my main concern.

772
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:39,048
Which is what?

773
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:41,719
You need this audience
as much as I do, Adam.

774
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:45,956
I'll keep them invested.

775
00:44:01,905 --> 00:44:07,044
Last week an American
ended her life

776
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:09,913
right in front of you
on national television.

777
00:44:09,945 --> 00:44:12,081
It was shocking.

778
00:44:12,114 --> 00:44:16,085
Some say it was appalling...

779
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:17,387
but it was real.

780
00:44:21,123 --> 00:44:24,927
We changed a young girl's
life for the better.

781
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,962
Now, if you don't like
what we're doing here,

782
00:44:26,996 --> 00:44:29,298
please, change the channel.

783
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:32,234
Close your browser,
file a complaint,

784
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:34,271
or simply turn it off.

785
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:36,873
Will this fellow ever
follow the script?

786
00:44:36,905 --> 00:44:40,844
But I'm willing to bet
that you won't.

787
00:44:40,876 --> 00:44:43,012
Because, deep down, you know

788
00:44:43,045 --> 00:44:45,748
that what we're doing here
is important.

789
00:44:47,182 --> 00:44:48,951
You're angry.

790
00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:51,887
You want change.

791
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,259
You believe in the value
of life.

792
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:58,394
Well, guess what?
So do I.

793
00:44:58,427 --> 00:45:00,130
And so do our three guests
tonight.

794
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:01,197
Cue applause.

795
00:45:07,936 --> 00:45:10,139
It seems my producers want
me to get on with the show.

796
00:45:10,172 --> 00:45:11,808
Cue applause.

797
00:45:24,387 --> 00:45:27,457
Friends...

798
00:45:27,489 --> 00:45:31,861
last week you also changed
a young girl's life.

799
00:45:31,894 --> 00:45:37,067
$300,000 was raised
for Emily Hickey.

800
00:45:37,099 --> 00:45:40,269
$300,000!

801
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:43,873
Over 100 of you even called in
offering to be her foster parent.

802
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:52,750
And because of you, and you,
and you, and you...

803
00:45:54,951 --> 00:45:56,920
Emily will find a safe home.

804
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:01,525
She'll go to college, she'll get
a degree

805
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:03,994
and fulfill her mother's dreams.

806
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:15,905
You have all lead by example,

807
00:46:15,938 --> 00:46:19,275
and the WBC network
heard you loud and clear.

808
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:23,547
So from here on in...

809
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:26,949
we will be donating $250,000

810
00:46:26,983 --> 00:46:29,586
to the guest that you believe
deserves it the most.

811
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:32,255
All you have to do is vote.

812
00:46:35,123 --> 00:46:36,326
We go from one death to three,

813
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:37,927
and now we're doing
death of the week?

814
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,929
Was this your idea?

815
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,265
He's flying solo, but I like it.

816
00:46:41,297 --> 00:46:44,466
I just have to convince our board
of directors to play along.

817
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,436
He's gonna get himself fired.

818
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:49,873
Yeah, or make himself
indispensable.

819
00:46:49,905 --> 00:46:51,507
All right, put me in his ear.

820
00:46:53,976 --> 00:46:56,612
Adam, you crazy son of a bitch.

821
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:58,849
<i>We're a go.</i>

822
00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:10,292
<i>Please welcome Adam Rogers!</i>

823
00:47:10,326 --> 00:47:11,894
Let's get started.

824
00:47:11,927 --> 00:47:14,431
Introducing Timothy Reyes.

825
00:47:14,463 --> 00:47:17,099
Timothy was diagnosed with ALS

826
00:47:17,132 --> 00:47:20,369
and has come to share
his last moments with us.

827
00:47:39,322 --> 00:47:41,490
Please welcome Ellen Black.

828
00:47:41,523 --> 00:47:43,460
Ellen wants to donate
her potential winnings

829
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:45,895
to aid Syrian refugees.

830
00:48:07,617 --> 00:48:10,487
<i>This is David Williams.</i>

831
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:13,657
David's wife needs
a heart transplant.

832
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,461
With no donors in sight,
he's giving his own.

833
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,367
Do it already!

834
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,503
Ah!

835
00:48:39,282 --> 00:48:40,583
Don't you think it's horrible?

836
00:48:40,615 --> 00:48:42,652
I do.
- So why do you do it?

837
00:48:42,684 --> 00:48:44,586
Because I saw somebody die,

838
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:47,156
murdered, right in front
of me, not too long ago.

839
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,025
It was a senseless
waste of life,

840
00:48:50,059 --> 00:48:51,995
but the deaths
on my show are not.

841
00:48:52,027 --> 00:48:55,397
The number one show in
the United States of America.

842
00:48:56,798 --> 00:48:59,101
<i>But you're profiting
off of other people's misery.</i>

843
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,539
Isn't everybody profiting off
of other people's misery, Mark?

844
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,307
The churches profit,
the banks profit,

845
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,276
the fast food companies profit.

846
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:07,711
Journalists
just like you profit.

847
00:49:07,744 --> 00:49:10,512
Don't think that you're above
this, because you're not.

848
00:49:10,545 --> 00:49:13,415
Besides, I'm not doing
this for the money.

849
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:14,717
What are you doing it for then?

850
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,420
I'm doing it because television
needs a wake-up call, that's why.

851
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:18,688
<i>We're in pain.
We're alone.</i>

852
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:22,759
<i>We need to connect again.</i>

853
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:25,996
<i>We need to bridge the social,
racial and political divide,</i>

854
00:49:26,028 --> 00:49:28,664
<i>and I think--
Actually, I believe</i>

855
00:49:28,697 --> 00:49:30,699
that we are the catalyst for
that change.

856
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:34,538
Adam Rogers for president!

857
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:58,560
I can almost guarantee you
number one all across the world.

858
00:49:58,594 --> 00:49:59,862
What do you guys say?

859
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:02,532
Oh, I love to hear it. I love to hear it.
Thank you so much.

860
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,501
Try one with a smile.

861
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,074
<i>When will it be enough?</i>

862
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:13,143
That's a good question.
I don't know.

863
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:14,677
When people stop watching,
I guess.

864
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:17,679
When they don't need us anymore.

865
00:50:17,713 --> 00:50:19,816
But right now they do.

866
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:42,105
Oh!

867
00:50:42,137 --> 00:50:46,175
<i>This Is Your Death!
This Is Your Death!</i>

868
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:48,744
<i>This Is Your Death!</i>

869
00:50:48,777 --> 00:50:51,747
<i>This Is Your Death!</i>

870
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,349
<i>This Is Your Death!</i>

871
00:50:58,887 --> 00:51:00,222
Sylvia.

872
00:51:02,425 --> 00:51:03,793
I owe you a drink.

873
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:08,164
Look, we're a team
and I feel like...

874
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:12,268
I-I guess I feel like I could
be keeping you in the loop

875
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,436
more than I have been.

876
00:51:14,469 --> 00:51:16,138
And a drink is gonna solve that?

877
00:51:16,172 --> 00:51:17,773
No, but four might.

878
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:20,510
All right.
Good night.

879
00:51:20,543 --> 00:51:22,811
Hey.
You can hate me,

880
00:51:22,844 --> 00:51:24,179
you can hate
what we're doing here,

881
00:51:24,213 --> 00:51:25,849
but you can't deny
that we're a good team.

882
00:51:25,882 --> 00:51:27,617
We're not a team.
- Yes, we are!

883
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,485
No! No, come on.

884
00:51:29,518 --> 00:51:32,187
You just do whatever you want
and I clean up your messes.

885
00:51:32,221 --> 00:51:33,322
Right.

886
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:36,392
One of these days
I will stop, though.

887
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:38,528
We have the number one show
on television.

888
00:51:38,561 --> 00:51:40,797
I made you rich.

889
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:42,699
I mean, what else do you want?

890
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,501
<i>What else do you want?</i>

891
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:47,536
I want a drink.

892
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:49,239
Maybe a sleepover.

893
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,209
Good night, Adam.

894
00:51:57,313 --> 00:51:59,148
I'll take you up on that drink.

895
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,789
You Washington?
- Yeah.

896
00:52:06,822 --> 00:52:08,590
You the foreman?
- Yep.

897
00:52:08,623 --> 00:52:12,261
It's nice to see you.
I've got you my résumé.

898
00:52:14,429 --> 00:52:16,365
Oh, uh, you think about dyin'?

899
00:52:16,398 --> 00:52:18,400
Excuse me?

900
00:52:18,434 --> 00:52:19,869
Oh yeah, that.

901
00:52:19,902 --> 00:52:21,737
Yeah, that's the truth.

902
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:22,906
You gotta see it.

903
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:27,943
Anyhow, this is a union job.

904
00:52:27,976 --> 00:52:30,712
How do you have so much
experience with no union card?

905
00:52:30,746 --> 00:52:34,951
Oh, well, I was, uh... a
temp filler over in Chicago,

906
00:52:34,983 --> 00:52:37,519
and it kinda, you know, basically
turned into a full-time job.

907
00:52:37,552 --> 00:52:38,654
Fuckin' Chicago.

908
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:41,291
Yeah, well, you got that right.

909
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:46,896
Well, we're looking to fill
the 8:00 to 6:00 spot.

910
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:48,831
That's pm to am.

911
00:52:48,864 --> 00:52:50,666
You'll need to join the
longshoremen's union, too,

912
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:52,768
so there'll be some upfront
costs there, as well.

913
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:54,871
Hey, no problem.
I get benefits, right?

914
00:52:54,903 --> 00:52:57,940
Oh, yeah, yeah.

915
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,843
It happens
all the time. Look.

916
00:53:01,577 --> 00:53:03,780
Now I'm gonna need to see

917
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,383
your forklift certification
for ocean.

918
00:53:10,418 --> 00:53:11,554
Is there a problem?

919
00:53:12,554 --> 00:53:14,456
Listen, I need this job bad.

920
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:15,991
Now, I can do anything
your guys can do,

921
00:53:16,025 --> 00:53:18,728
I just don't have any forklift
experience, but I'm a quick study.

922
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:21,431
Trust me.
- Can you lash a ship?

923
00:53:21,463 --> 00:53:23,299
Of course.
- What's lashing, then?

924
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,971
I'm sorry, Mr. Washington.

925
00:53:28,003 --> 00:53:29,438
We don't have the time
or resources

926
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:31,007
to be training greenhorns
right now,

927
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:32,442
especially someone
as old as you.

928
00:53:32,474 --> 00:53:33,576
Please, sir.
Look, I got a family,

929
00:53:33,610 --> 00:53:35,878
I got two kids, I got a
house I'm about to lose.

930
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:37,646
I'll do anything you ask.

931
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:40,916
Brunt labor, overtime,
janitorial.

932
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:43,685
You wanna go clean toilets?
Go talk to the port.

933
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:45,588
Wait, no, no, wait, wait,
wait! Hold on, man.

934
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:47,356
Don't-- don't turn
your back on me.

935
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:48,590
Look, I'm out of options!

936
00:53:48,623 --> 00:53:50,025
Get out of my way, son!

937
00:53:51,427 --> 00:53:52,961
You usually call
your elders "son"?

938
00:53:55,597 --> 00:53:57,266
Go fuck yourself!

939
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,238
Aaargh!

940
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,840
Time to call the janitor, boss!

941
00:54:17,385 --> 00:54:19,422
Jesus.
- Move forward. Right there.

942
00:54:19,454 --> 00:54:20,690
Ah...

943
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:29,532
Holy shit.
- Yeah. Yeah, right?

944
00:54:29,565 --> 00:54:30,900
Look at this.
My favorite part.

945
00:54:30,932 --> 00:54:32,302
Come here, come here, come here.

946
00:54:34,536 --> 00:54:36,438
See that casita back there?

947
00:54:36,472 --> 00:54:39,709
Two bedrooms, full kitchen,
and it's got your name on it.

948
00:54:39,742 --> 00:54:42,345
I can't afford that.

949
00:54:42,378 --> 00:54:44,447
You really think I'm
gonna make you pay rent?

950
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,317
You can stay there for free
as long as you want.

951
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:50,353
Okay? All you gotta do is, you
know, save up for your own place.

952
00:54:50,385 --> 00:54:52,788
Adam, I got six-figure
credit card debt to pay off

953
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:54,356
before I can even think
about buying a house.

954
00:54:54,389 --> 00:54:55,391
Right, right, right.

955
00:54:55,423 --> 00:54:58,894
Right?
- That reminds me.

956
00:54:59,994 --> 00:55:01,431
Come on.

957
00:55:06,501 --> 00:55:09,971
I'm not making you rich, I'm
just putting you back to zero.

958
00:55:10,005 --> 00:55:12,474
No. Adam, I can't.

959
00:55:12,507 --> 00:55:14,009
I-I haven't seen you
in three months,

960
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:15,778
you know you're my only friend.

961
00:55:15,811 --> 00:55:17,880
I-I know, I know.
And I'm sorry.

962
00:55:17,913 --> 00:55:20,083
I've just been...
I've been really busy.

963
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:24,019
Would you look at yourself?

964
00:55:24,052 --> 00:55:25,621
Would you look at this house?

965
00:55:25,653 --> 00:55:28,623
This is sick.
- Yeah.

966
00:55:28,657 --> 00:55:30,727
Yeah, you mean sick like cool?

967
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,994
Because...
- No.

968
00:55:32,027 --> 00:55:34,364
Because I agree.
- No, Adam, I'm not joking,

969
00:55:34,396 --> 00:55:35,864
and I do not want
your blood money.

970
00:55:37,065 --> 00:55:41,002
You're my sister and I love you,
and you've been doing so well

971
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:42,838
and I promised that I was
gonna take care of you.

972
00:55:42,871 --> 00:55:45,674
At what cost, Adam?
- What do you mean, at what cost?

973
00:55:45,708 --> 00:55:49,144
How many people had to
die for this house?

974
00:55:49,177 --> 00:55:51,646
For that check?

975
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:54,916
Ten? 30? 50?

976
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:56,718
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Don't be ridiculous.

977
00:55:56,751 --> 00:55:57,987
Is death ridiculous to you now?

978
00:55:58,019 --> 00:55:59,121
No, it isn't--
- Do you know what I do?

979
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:02,024
No, it's not ridiculous,
and if you watched my show,

980
00:56:02,056 --> 00:56:04,593
you'd know that I take
my job very seriously.

981
00:56:04,626 --> 00:56:06,695
By showing death,
I am single-handedly

982
00:56:06,728 --> 00:56:08,130
changing people's
approach to life.

983
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:09,565
The world's finally waking up.

984
00:56:09,597 --> 00:56:11,634
You are a fucking game
show host, Adam!

985
00:56:11,666 --> 00:56:14,503
And that is all!

986
00:56:14,536 --> 00:56:16,505
Wake up!

987
00:56:29,885 --> 00:56:32,822
<i>And now, your host, Adam Rogers!</i>

988
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:37,827
Thank you.

989
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:49,538
So I had an interesting and sobering
conversation with my sister today,

990
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,641
and in the name of transparency,

991
00:56:51,673 --> 00:56:53,175
I thought I would
share it with you.

992
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,309
Oh, no.

993
00:56:54,344 --> 00:56:59,715
She thinks that what we're
doing here is abominable.

994
00:57:02,217 --> 00:57:04,519
No, no, no. It's okay.
It's okay.

995
00:57:04,552 --> 00:57:07,589
Camera one.
- Dissenting opinion is okay.

996
00:57:07,623 --> 00:57:08,858
Camera three.

997
00:57:08,891 --> 00:57:11,693
But what really got me was when
she called it a game show,

998
00:57:11,726 --> 00:57:12,994
as if--

999
00:57:13,028 --> 00:57:16,766
Yeah, yeah, as if all that was
at stake here is the money.

1000
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:19,001
Cut to one.

1001
00:57:19,034 --> 00:57:21,103
Yeah, I know.
It hurt me, too.

1002
00:57:21,135 --> 00:57:23,873
<i>It was ignorant.</i>

1003
00:57:23,905 --> 00:57:25,574
<i>And insensitive.</i>

1004
00:57:27,775 --> 00:57:28,976
<i>Not to me, but to the folks</i>

1005
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:33,148
<i>who have literally given
their lives for a higher cause.</i>

1006
00:57:33,181 --> 00:57:35,517
<i>And the fact that it came
from my own sister,</i>

1007
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:39,221
<i>the only family member
that I have left in this world.</i>

1008
00:57:41,023 --> 00:57:42,892
<i>I guess that just made it hurt
even worse.</i>

1009
00:57:47,295 --> 00:57:48,931
We'll be back
after these messages

1010
00:57:48,963 --> 00:57:50,866
<i>with more This Is Your Death.</i>

1011
00:57:58,673 --> 00:58:00,509
<i>- What?
- Hi, Karina?</i>

1012
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:02,612
It's Sylvia. He really doesn't
mean what he's saying.

1013
00:58:02,644 --> 00:58:03,612
How did you get my number?

1014
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,914
<i>You're Adam's emergency contact.</i>

1015
00:58:04,947 --> 00:58:07,148
<i>- Fuck him.
- I'm sorry I'm calling you, but I--</i>

1016
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:09,050
Fuck you.
- I agree.

1017
00:58:09,083 --> 00:58:11,152
Fuck both of us. Just please,
please don't blame yourself.

1018
00:58:11,186 --> 00:58:15,557
<i>Uh, Adam told me a little bit
about your history and...</i>

1019
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:19,728
<i>I really don't mean to pry but I think
it might be a good idea to call someone.</i>

1020
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:21,230
I don't need a fucking
therapist right now.

1021
00:58:21,262 --> 00:58:23,098
I need to relax.

1022
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:27,202
What happened to my brother?!!

1023
00:58:27,235 --> 00:58:29,771
I don't know.

1024
00:58:29,804 --> 00:58:32,541
I really don't know.

1025
00:58:32,574 --> 00:58:33,708
I'm so sorry.

1026
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:44,987
On in 25.

1027
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:47,989
Listen, I-- I have
to keep running this show,

1028
00:58:48,023 --> 00:58:49,925
but I'm not getting
off the phone

1029
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:51,960
until you tell me
you're gonna be okay.

1030
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:03,739
Okay, I'll call.

1031
00:59:04,773 --> 00:59:06,209
I owe you one.

1032
00:59:08,911 --> 00:59:10,046
Stay on.

1033
00:59:12,947 --> 00:59:14,817
In time.

1034
00:59:14,849 --> 00:59:18,820
On in five, four, three...

1035
00:59:22,724 --> 00:59:24,326
Standby VTR.

1036
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,762
Ladies and gentlemen,
what are we here to do?

1037
00:59:26,795 --> 00:59:29,298
To change.

1038
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:31,834
And what are we gonna change?
- The world!

1039
00:59:31,867 --> 00:59:34,202
<i>- I'm sorry, what are we gonna change?
- Adam's on here next.</i>

1040
00:59:34,235 --> 00:59:36,004
<i>- The world!
- What're you guys watching?</i>

1041
00:59:36,038 --> 00:59:39,641
Derrick made an antenna.
We got basic cable back.

1042
00:59:39,675 --> 00:59:42,178
<i>- What're we here to do?
- Don't watch this trash.</i>

1043
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:44,947
It ain't trash, pops.
It's people like us.

1044
00:59:47,715 --> 00:59:49,317
Dad!
- Mason!

1045
00:59:49,351 --> 00:59:52,121
Those people are not like us.

1046
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:53,556
They're poor and desperate.

1047
00:59:53,588 --> 00:59:56,891
They're sacrificing themselves for
the betterment of their families.

1048
00:59:56,925 --> 00:59:59,061
Do these four walls look
poor and desperate to you?

1049
00:59:59,094 --> 01:00:00,262
Mason.
- No!

1050
01:00:00,295 --> 01:00:02,999
Do you know how hard I worked
to get you into a good school

1051
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:04,834
so you could do things I
could never dream of doing?

1052
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,869
Yeah, dad, I do.

1053
01:00:06,902 --> 01:00:10,039
And I also know that we're
about to lose it all.

1054
01:00:10,072 --> 01:00:12,008
What? You think
I'm dumb?

1055
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:15,978
You think I don't hear you
and mom arguing every night?

1056
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,648
I tried talking to you
like a million times,

1057
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:22,050
and every time you shut
me down like I'm a kid.

1058
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:24,886
But I'm not.

1059
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,257
My crutches are six
inches too small,

1060
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:30,659
but I don't say nothing,

1061
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,663
'cause I know that you
can't afford to fix it.

1062
01:00:33,695 --> 01:00:35,797
So you want to deal
with this by yourself?

1063
01:00:35,831 --> 01:00:38,668
Then fucking deal with it, okay?

1064
01:00:53,382 --> 01:00:55,818
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome our next guest.

1065
01:00:55,851 --> 01:00:58,688
This is Meg Waters,
here to remind us

1066
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:03,358
that not all soldiers are ordered
to fight the good fight.

1067
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,143
Not all soldiers are ordered
to fight the good fight, huh?

1068
01:01:21,175 --> 01:01:22,277
That includes us.

1069
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:23,979
Yeah, no, I understand metaphor.

1070
01:01:24,012 --> 01:01:25,247
You fucking prick.
- I'm sorry,

1071
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,283
was that a metaphor or a simile?

1072
01:01:27,315 --> 01:01:31,019
It's a statement.
Hey, call your sister.

1073
01:01:31,052 --> 01:01:33,088
She saw what you said and
she's having a breakdown.

1074
01:01:33,121 --> 01:01:34,824
Well, that's not the first time.

1075
01:01:34,856 --> 01:01:36,092
I'll call her after the show.

1076
01:01:36,125 --> 01:01:39,461
Adam--
- After the show, Sylvia.

1077
01:01:39,494 --> 01:01:42,130
She's why you quit Yale,
isn't she?

1078
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,972
We're losing the audience.
They can't see.

1079
01:01:51,005 --> 01:01:52,774
This is a bad idea.

1080
01:01:52,807 --> 01:01:54,409
Cue the heartbeats.

1081
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,823
I-I-- Is she passed out?

1082
01:02:07,856 --> 01:02:09,759
Can I get the interior car view?

1083
01:02:09,791 --> 01:02:10,925
Cue camera one.

1084
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:13,495
Stand by, car cam 2.

1085
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,333
Guys, I can't see shit.

1086
01:02:17,365 --> 01:02:19,534
<i>- Is she dead?
- Her heart monitor says no,</i>

1087
01:02:19,568 --> 01:02:21,203
but it shouldn't be more
than two minutes.

1088
01:02:21,235 --> 01:02:22,871
Put up the facts about the CO2.

1089
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,507
<i>- Insert CO2 details.
- She's not dying!</i>

1090
01:02:27,108 --> 01:02:28,277
She's not dying!

1091
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:30,112
We're losing our audience.

1092
01:02:30,144 --> 01:02:32,815
Come on, get
your shit together out there.

1093
01:02:32,847 --> 01:02:34,983
This is fucking boring.
Kill it.

1094
01:02:35,016 --> 01:02:37,285
We can't fake a death!
Adam, back me up here.

1095
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:39,154
<i>We are all about
transparency, am I right?</i>

1096
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:41,490
<i>We're not faking a death.</i>

1097
01:02:41,523 --> 01:02:43,760
She can die backstage
for all I care.

1098
01:02:50,298 --> 01:02:51,601
Let her finish backstage.

1099
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:54,269
<i>- Adam, I really don't think that's--
- Just do it.</i>

1100
01:02:59,173 --> 01:03:01,143
Okay, slow down the heartbeat.

1101
01:03:01,175 --> 01:03:03,045
Slower.

1102
01:03:03,077 --> 01:03:05,181
Slower.

1103
01:03:05,213 --> 01:03:07,449
And kill it.

1104
01:03:18,059 --> 01:03:21,864
Ladies and gentlemen, Meg Waters.

1105
01:03:21,896 --> 01:03:23,498
Come on, people, Meg Waters.

1106
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:27,269
There we go.

1107
01:03:31,572 --> 01:03:35,243
<i>We'll be back with more This
Is Your Death right after this.</i>

1108
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,248
Whoa, did you see that?

1109
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:43,552
She's not dead!
Did anyone see that?

1110
01:03:44,952 --> 01:03:45,987
Damn.

1111
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:49,192
Fuck.

1112
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:53,996
Excuse me.

1113
01:04:03,572 --> 01:04:05,575
Hello!
Thank you. Yeah.

1114
01:04:11,346 --> 01:04:12,882
She isn't out yet.
Can I get her out?

1115
01:04:12,914 --> 01:04:14,983
No, no, no. Don't touch
it, don't touch it.

1116
01:04:15,016 --> 01:04:17,485
If we pull her out and
she dies, it's on us.

1117
01:04:21,222 --> 01:04:23,226
Give me that. Okay.
- Yeah.

1118
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,469
Shit.

1119
01:04:35,536 --> 01:04:38,172
Okay. Okay, everything's
gonna be okay.

1120
01:04:38,206 --> 01:04:40,009
Jesus Christ!

1121
01:04:43,411 --> 01:04:44,980
No, no, no. No!
- Let me out, please!

1122
01:04:58,492 --> 01:05:00,630
The world is a better place
because of our show.

1123
01:05:02,297 --> 01:05:05,134
To heal, we need to see pain,

1124
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:06,969
and our cause is too important

1125
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:10,172
to be hijacked by a woman
who had second thoughts!

1126
01:05:10,204 --> 01:05:12,208
She chose this!

1127
01:05:14,342 --> 01:05:17,045
She chose this. Hey.

1128
01:05:22,516 --> 01:05:25,587
Jesus Christ.
Die already.

1129
01:05:27,289 --> 01:05:30,726
Okay. Just let me
handle this.

1130
01:05:30,759 --> 01:05:32,661
Just let me handle this.

1131
01:05:32,693 --> 01:05:35,331
Good work.
Good work.

1132
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:52,181
It's okay!

1133
01:06:32,253 --> 01:06:33,521
Take care of it.

1134
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:40,162
All right, people,
we're back in 15 seconds.

1135
01:07:01,449 --> 01:07:03,351
They think we faked her death.

1136
01:07:04,652 --> 01:07:07,255
What happened in the car, Adam?

1137
01:07:08,489 --> 01:07:12,160
Ilana told me our
numbers are down.

1138
01:07:12,193 --> 01:07:14,563
I think people
are getting bored.

1139
01:07:14,596 --> 01:07:15,764
We need to up the stakes.

1140
01:07:15,797 --> 01:07:17,800
What happened in the car, Adam?

1141
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,570
Nothing.

1142
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:24,240
Turns out she died
on stage, after all.

1143
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:33,347
No more staging
anti-climactic deaths.

1144
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:35,716
We need "boom."

1145
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:37,652
What about their
reasons for dying?

1146
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:41,423
Isn't that the most
important thing?

1147
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:43,059
Hmm?

1148
01:07:45,226 --> 01:07:47,528
Nothing.

1149
01:07:47,561 --> 01:07:49,730
Ilana.
- All right. Get going.

1150
01:07:49,764 --> 01:07:52,634
Excuse me.
I have an idea.

1151
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:55,403
We need to make a splash if we're gonna
get renewed for a second season,

1152
01:07:55,436 --> 01:07:56,838
am I right?
- Mm-hmm.

1153
01:07:56,871 --> 01:07:58,873
Right. $250,000
is not gonna cut it

1154
01:07:58,907 --> 01:08:00,609
if we want to attract
the best contestants.

1155
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:03,277
I thought they
weren't contestants.

1156
01:08:03,311 --> 01:08:05,514
Are you finished?

1157
01:08:05,547 --> 01:08:08,449
I'm thinking $1 million.
- A million?

1158
01:08:08,483 --> 01:08:12,488
$1 million for the death of the
year on the season finale.

1159
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:15,590
We get the audience involved,

1160
01:08:15,623 --> 01:08:17,559
we plaster billboards
all over the country,

1161
01:08:17,591 --> 01:08:19,327
and the next thing you know
we're back on top,

1162
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,563
just like that.
Say yes.

1163
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,268
I'll talk to the network.
- No, no, no.

1164
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:27,703
I need a yes or a no.

1165
01:08:29,904 --> 01:08:32,240
I'll convince them.
- Thank you.

1166
01:09:33,902 --> 01:09:35,337
Hey.
- Hi.

1167
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:37,338
Uh, I forgot my run-down
for next week.

1168
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:40,709
You wouldn't happen to have
an extra one, would you?

1169
01:09:40,742 --> 01:09:41,842
Oh.
- Yeah.

1170
01:09:41,876 --> 01:09:44,445
Perfect. Thank you.

1171
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,182
Good night.
- Good night.

1172
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:03,632
Little man,
I've got a quest--

1173
01:10:09,837 --> 01:10:10,872
Hey, where's Elliot?

1174
01:10:10,905 --> 01:10:12,673
He was transferred to
palliative last night.

1175
01:10:12,707 --> 01:10:15,244
What?

1176
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:20,849
Sorry.

1177
01:10:20,881 --> 01:10:22,283
Excuse me.

1178
01:10:24,685 --> 01:10:26,322
Oh, no.

1179
01:10:28,756 --> 01:10:30,291
What are you doing here?

1180
01:10:31,826 --> 01:10:36,265
No, no, oh, no.
No. You get out.

1181
01:10:36,297 --> 01:10:37,765
Please, can I just say goodbye?
- No.

1182
01:10:37,798 --> 01:10:41,802
No, you cannot. I told them
to keep you away from him.

1183
01:10:41,836 --> 01:10:43,639
Don't you think you have
done enough to screw up

1184
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:47,041
the last few weeks
of my son's life?

1185
01:10:47,074 --> 01:10:49,344
He is 11 years old,
for God's sake.

1186
01:10:49,377 --> 01:10:51,313
You had him talking
about nothing but death.

1187
01:10:51,345 --> 01:10:53,481
That wasn't me, I promise you. I
tried to stop him from watching--

1188
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:57,352
Fuck you! Fuck you,
you Satanist bitch!

1189
01:10:57,385 --> 01:10:59,488
You brainwashed my son!

1190
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,988
<i>- Please...
- You stole his innocence.</i>

1191
01:11:01,021 --> 01:11:03,958
I love your son. I just want
to say goodbye to him--

1192
01:11:03,992 --> 01:11:06,528
Get out! You get out!
You get out!

1193
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,296
Get her out of here before I do!

1194
01:11:08,329 --> 01:11:09,797
I'm sorry.

1195
01:11:40,761 --> 01:11:41,764
Mr. Curtis?

1196
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:45,534
I spoke to a friend and he told me
you were a man who gets things done.

1197
01:11:47,702 --> 01:11:50,639
I know you.
Mr. Washington, right?

1198
01:11:50,671 --> 01:11:53,375
Yeah, you used to live
a few blocks away from here.

1199
01:11:53,408 --> 01:11:56,712
Pretty wife, good job, a kid.

1200
01:11:56,744 --> 01:11:59,414
Two now.
No job.

1201
01:12:00,582 --> 01:12:01,883
You don't want
to be messing with me.

1202
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:03,518
No, no, no.
I don't want drugs.

1203
01:12:03,551 --> 01:12:08,123
I hear that you loan money
to people in need sometimes.

1204
01:12:08,155 --> 01:12:09,890
Not to people like you.

1205
01:12:09,923 --> 01:12:11,726
Look, it's just a few thou.

1206
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,063
I'll pay you back, man.
I promise.

1207
01:12:15,095 --> 01:12:16,931
And what happens if you don't?

1208
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,670
The streets ain't
for you no more.

1209
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:22,838
Drive.

1210
01:12:47,828 --> 01:12:50,731
You're an abomination!

1211
01:12:58,672 --> 01:13:02,676
Life is a gift!

1212
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:05,881
This is not the American way!

1213
01:13:05,913 --> 01:13:08,849
Stop this madness!

1214
01:13:13,454 --> 01:13:15,689
This is so wrong!

1215
01:13:21,095 --> 01:13:23,899
<i>I'm here at the scene of
auditions for This Is Your Death.</i>

1216
01:13:23,931 --> 01:13:25,900
There's a $1,000,000 prize.
But however,

1217
01:13:25,934 --> 01:13:30,439
there are also allegations of faking
a death on a previous episode.

1218
01:13:30,471 --> 01:13:31,939
We're hoping to find out
more today.

1219
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:34,676
As you know, we're running these
auditions throughout the country today,

1220
01:13:34,708 --> 01:13:37,878
so there's no guarantee that
any of you will be selected.

1221
01:13:37,912 --> 01:13:40,715
Our casting criteria
changes show by show,

1222
01:13:40,747 --> 01:13:44,018
so all you need to do
is be yourselves

1223
01:13:44,051 --> 01:13:47,154
and prove your willingness to go
through with your suicide on stage.

1224
01:13:47,188 --> 01:13:49,658
Now, we're gonna set you up
with one of our psychiatrists

1225
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:52,126
who are gonna run you through
some questions. Cool?

1226
01:13:55,930 --> 01:13:58,533
Gentlemen, the FBI can ask
questions all day long,

1227
01:13:58,565 --> 01:14:00,702
but neither Sylvia nor Adam
nor any of the crew

1228
01:14:00,734 --> 01:14:03,771
are gonna talk until charges,
if any, are pressed.

1229
01:14:03,805 --> 01:14:05,106
Are we clear?

1230
01:14:08,576 --> 01:14:10,212
You'll be hearing from us.

1231
01:14:10,244 --> 01:14:11,979
Thank you, guys.

1232
01:14:17,985 --> 01:14:20,154
What the fuck was that?!

1233
01:14:34,801 --> 01:14:37,139
Well, this is awkward.

1234
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,576
Adam, can I talk to you?

1235
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:43,011
<i>Uh, no. I'm late for my New
York Standard interview.</i>

1236
01:14:43,043 --> 01:14:45,646
I know that you lied to me
about that woman in the car.

1237
01:14:47,081 --> 01:14:49,518
I lied to you?
Uh, no, I didn't.

1238
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:50,652
She died on stage.

1239
01:14:51,886 --> 01:14:53,889
The car cameras were
still rolling.

1240
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:58,227
I saw the tape.

1241
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,498
I know that you killed her.

1242
01:15:05,699 --> 01:15:09,203
Yet you didn't report me, which
makes you an accomplice.

1243
01:15:11,573 --> 01:15:14,309
Jesus.
What happened to you?

1244
01:15:14,341 --> 01:15:17,211
I built this show, Sylvia.

1245
01:15:17,244 --> 01:15:18,613
And I'm not gonna let it die

1246
01:15:18,645 --> 01:15:22,317
because some pussy
had second thoughts.

1247
01:15:22,350 --> 01:15:23,886
Now...

1248
01:15:26,087 --> 01:15:28,023
Did you delete the footage?

1249
01:15:30,291 --> 01:15:31,592
Of course.

1250
01:15:32,827 --> 01:15:36,297
Good. Good.
Adam, call for you on two.

1251
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:39,134
Take a message.
- It's your sister.

1252
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:41,603
Then definitely take a message.

1253
01:15:41,636 --> 01:15:43,238
It sounds bad, man.

1254
01:15:56,283 --> 01:15:58,619
Karina, what is it?

1255
01:15:58,653 --> 01:16:01,590
<i>Do you remember when
we were kids</i>

1256
01:16:01,622 --> 01:16:05,159
and you
pretended to be a monster?

1257
01:16:05,193 --> 01:16:07,061
What?

1258
01:16:07,095 --> 01:16:09,798
<i>One minute you were
my big brother.</i>

1259
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:13,301
<i>You were my hero.
And then you--</i>

1260
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:18,072
You were possessed
and I was so scared.

1261
01:16:19,239 --> 01:16:22,710
I was so scared...

1262
01:16:22,743 --> 01:16:24,878
and I cried and cried and cried.

1263
01:16:24,912 --> 01:16:26,113
Okay, Karina.

1264
01:16:26,146 --> 01:16:28,716
Karina, I have to get to an
interview right now, okay?

1265
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:29,818
I'll talk to you later.

1266
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:31,853
I got fired today.

1267
01:16:31,886 --> 01:16:33,688
<i>- What?
- Don't be mad.</i>

1268
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,155
What-- what'd you do?

1269
01:16:35,189 --> 01:16:39,159
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.

1270
01:16:39,193 --> 01:16:41,063
I just wanted to relax.

1271
01:16:43,831 --> 01:16:45,967
<i>You're high right now, aren't you?</i>

1272
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,270
Goddammit. Sis,
those kids needed you!

1273
01:16:49,302 --> 01:16:51,206
<i>You needed them.</i>

1274
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:53,641
The kids didn't need me.

1275
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:58,680
<i>I was the stupid sister
of a satanic TV host.</i>

1276
01:16:58,712 --> 01:17:02,182
<i>- That's you. You're satanic.
- Okay.</i>

1277
01:17:02,216 --> 01:17:05,020
Okay, sober up.

1278
01:17:05,052 --> 01:17:07,389
Call your sponsor,
and then your therapist,

1279
01:17:07,421 --> 01:17:09,156
and then we'll talk
about this together,

1280
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:11,792
after the finale, all right?

1281
01:17:11,826 --> 01:17:13,127
Yeah.

1282
01:17:15,829 --> 01:17:17,731
Dammit!

1283
01:17:17,765 --> 01:17:19,868
Perfect.

1284
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:24,139
Uh, I'm not sure
we can do this on stage.

1285
01:17:24,171 --> 01:17:25,739
One sec.

1286
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:27,141
Yeah, I need to talk to Sylvia.

1287
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:32,180
Hi, Zach.

1288
01:17:32,212 --> 01:17:34,381
He wants to what?

1289
01:17:34,414 --> 01:17:36,083
Adam, we need to talk
about the season finale.

1290
01:17:36,117 --> 01:17:37,318
It can wait.

1291
01:17:37,351 --> 01:17:42,791
Uh, no, it can't wait because
it is the season finale.

1292
01:17:42,823 --> 01:17:44,692
Adam!
- Sylvia, it can wait.

1293
01:17:44,725 --> 01:17:46,894
No, it can't. We are about
to interview call-backs

1294
01:17:46,927 --> 01:17:48,095
and I need your input.

1295
01:17:48,128 --> 01:17:50,064
I'm sorry, what's your title again?
It's producer, right?

1296
01:17:50,097 --> 01:17:52,199
So why don't you
fucking produce?

1297
01:17:52,233 --> 01:17:53,802
You know where we stand
in the ratings,

1298
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,837
you know what we need
to do, now get it done.

1299
01:18:16,323 --> 01:18:18,025
<i>- L'chaim.
- Wh--</i>

1300
01:18:19,894 --> 01:18:22,262
What?

1301
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:25,432
It's-- it's what the
Jewish kids say at school.

1302
01:18:25,466 --> 01:18:27,902
It means "to life".

1303
01:18:27,935 --> 01:18:29,437
I like it.

1304
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,472
<i>- L'chaim, then.
- L'chaim.</i>

1305
01:18:34,942 --> 01:18:35,976
Mmm!

1306
01:18:36,010 --> 01:18:37,746
Just a sip now, Derrick.

1307
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:39,414
I'm cool, ma.
I'm cool.

1308
01:18:39,447 --> 01:18:42,016
Daddy, what's your job?

1309
01:18:42,048 --> 01:18:44,252
Go on, explain it to her, honey.

1310
01:18:44,284 --> 01:18:46,186
Yeah, I'm junior head of sales

1311
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,757
for Southern California
Whirlpool.

1312
01:18:48,789 --> 01:18:51,126
Doesn't that sound so good?
- Yeah.

1313
01:18:51,158 --> 01:18:54,061
It's gonna be just like
the good old days.

1314
01:18:54,095 --> 01:18:56,231
Except even better.

1315
01:18:58,365 --> 01:18:59,900
Excuse me a minute.

1316
01:19:42,176 --> 01:19:44,145
Hey. Uh, Adam's gone.

1317
01:19:44,177 --> 01:19:47,015
That's okay, I wanted
to talk to you.

1318
01:19:47,047 --> 01:19:50,050
Oh, okay.
What's up?

1319
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:53,354
<i>I've made a decision
and I need your help.</i>

1320
01:19:53,386 --> 01:19:56,023
<i>But I need you to promise
this stays between us.</i>

1321
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:08,369
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

1322
01:20:08,402 --> 01:20:09,570
I knew you were trying your best

1323
01:20:09,604 --> 01:20:11,372
while I was just
working part time.

1324
01:20:11,404 --> 01:20:14,442
Oh, please. Please.

1325
01:20:14,475 --> 01:20:18,179
You were just raising
a beautiful family.

1326
01:20:18,212 --> 01:20:21,449
You're doing a great job
with these children.

1327
01:20:21,481 --> 01:20:25,286
You know that's more important
than any job out there.

1328
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:27,055
I mean it.

1329
01:20:27,087 --> 01:20:29,256
Eve, come here.
They're in here.

1330
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:31,993
Ta-da!

1331
01:20:35,029 --> 01:20:38,533
Is this like an all-expenses
paid business trip, pops?

1332
01:20:38,565 --> 01:20:40,902
Yes, sir.

1333
01:20:40,935 --> 01:20:43,571
I gotta go get trained up.

1334
01:20:43,604 --> 01:20:46,908
I gotta catch up on
the new technologies.

1335
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:48,309
Now, you, um...

1336
01:20:48,341 --> 01:20:51,945
you listen to your mother
while I'm gone, all right?

1337
01:20:51,979 --> 01:20:55,283
And you both work hard,
especially you.

1338
01:20:55,315 --> 01:20:57,853
You hear?
- We hear.

1339
01:21:03,224 --> 01:21:05,126
Hey, Dad.

1340
01:21:05,158 --> 01:21:08,629
I forgot to tell you, the 17th
president of the United States was,

1341
01:21:08,662 --> 01:21:10,598
um, Andrew Johnson.

1342
01:21:12,533 --> 01:21:16,438
That's right, son.
Good job.

1343
01:21:40,394 --> 01:21:41,997
Hey, guys, start rolling.

1344
01:21:45,365 --> 01:21:48,336
Mr. Washington, hi.
I'm Sylvia.

1345
01:21:48,368 --> 01:21:49,938
I'm the show's producer.

1346
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:52,439
Pleased to meet you,
Miss Sylvia.

1347
01:21:52,472 --> 01:21:55,976
Are you ready?

1348
01:21:56,010 --> 01:22:00,381
You know, I'd be lying
if I said yes.

1349
01:22:00,413 --> 01:22:02,250
I know what I gotta do.

1350
01:22:03,317 --> 01:22:05,653
Let's take a walk.

1351
01:22:05,685 --> 01:22:07,354
You're from L.A.,
right?

1352
01:22:07,387 --> 01:22:08,389
Yeah.

1353
01:22:08,422 --> 01:22:11,091
Yeah, I grew up a few
blocks from here, actually.

1354
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:13,694
Oh.

1355
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:16,463
I used to play on
these tracks as kids.

1356
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:39,087
Two and three I want you
bouncing off each other.

1357
01:22:39,119 --> 01:22:40,988
One on cue,
stay right under the jib.

1358
01:22:41,021 --> 01:22:42,023
FBI.

1359
01:22:42,056 --> 01:22:44,524
We have a warrant to obtain
footage immediately.

1360
01:22:44,557 --> 01:22:46,094
We're on air in 30 minutes.

1361
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,462
Can this wait until
after the show?

1362
01:22:47,494 --> 01:22:48,628
I'm afraid not.

1363
01:22:48,662 --> 01:22:50,698
We need all camera feeds
from episode 119.

1364
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:52,233
That's five terabytes.

1365
01:22:52,265 --> 01:22:53,734
You're talking about
at least two hours.

1366
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,136
There's a waiting area
in the hallway.

1367
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,704
Why don't you gentlemen make
yourselves comfortable over there?

1368
01:22:57,738 --> 01:23:00,108
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.

1369
01:23:03,743 --> 01:23:05,313
What the fuck was that
about, Ilana?

1370
01:23:05,345 --> 01:23:06,546
That was the car
exhaust episode.

1371
01:23:06,579 --> 01:23:08,283
Don't worry about it.
We're fine.

1372
01:23:14,255 --> 01:23:16,324
...55, 54,

1373
01:23:16,356 --> 01:23:18,158
53...

1374
01:23:18,192 --> 01:23:21,061
Hurrah!
Let's make a change!

1375
01:23:21,095 --> 01:23:22,296
Hurrah!

1376
01:23:22,328 --> 01:23:23,530
Let's make a change!

1377
01:23:23,564 --> 01:23:25,066
Hurrah!

1378
01:23:25,099 --> 01:23:26,434
Let's make a change!

1379
01:23:32,338 --> 01:23:34,609
You still have time
to change your mind.

1380
01:23:42,582 --> 01:23:45,185
Chiro?
It's time.

1381
01:23:55,095 --> 01:23:57,531
And Mason, we're gonna
need you ready in 10.

1382
01:24:25,725 --> 01:24:28,429
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1383
01:24:28,462 --> 01:24:29,697
<i>Honey, who is it?</i>

1384
01:24:29,729 --> 01:24:32,599
<i>I don't know,
I can't tell. Hello?</i>

1385
01:24:32,632 --> 01:24:35,269
<i>- Derrick, get the phone from your sister.
- What up?</i>

1386
01:24:35,301 --> 01:24:37,704
<i>Do not answer the phone
"what up".</i>

1387
01:24:37,738 --> 01:24:39,440
<i>I thought I taught you
better than that.</i>

1388
01:24:39,472 --> 01:24:40,875
<i>There's no one there.</i>

1389
01:24:40,908 --> 01:24:44,112
<i>- Yes, there is.
- No, there isn't.</i>

1390
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:46,414
<i>Mom, there's no one there.
Eve's just playing.</i>

1391
01:24:46,447 --> 01:24:48,615
<i>No, I'm not.
Don't call me a liar.</i>

1392
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:52,887
<i>- I'm not a liar, I promise.
- Okay, okay, sis, relax.</i>

1393
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:56,257
<i>Go brush your teeth and I'll
read you a story, a'ight?</i>

1394
01:24:56,289 --> 01:24:59,226
<i>All right, not a'ight.</i>

1395
01:26:23,877 --> 01:26:25,446
Didn't I tell you
this was going to be

1396
01:26:25,479 --> 01:26:27,548
the most memorable show ever?

1397
01:26:27,581 --> 01:26:30,851
<i>You just witnessed
a traditional Hari Kari,</i>

1398
01:26:30,884 --> 01:26:32,819
and that was just the beginning.

1399
01:26:32,853 --> 01:26:34,322
<i>Stay with us.</i>

1400
01:26:53,673 --> 01:26:56,911
I'm Karina.
I'm up next.

1401
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:03,418
Mason Washington.

1402
01:27:08,354 --> 01:27:09,957
And I'm scared as hell.

1403
01:27:13,527 --> 01:27:14,695
Yeah.

1404
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:22,270
Don't worry.
It'll be over soon.

1405
01:27:39,019 --> 01:27:41,655
Mason, can I ask why
you're doing this?

1406
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:51,766
I'm trying to save my family.

1407
01:27:51,798 --> 01:27:52,934
And you?

1408
01:27:53,966 --> 01:27:55,034
Same.

1409
01:27:58,471 --> 01:28:00,907
Karina, we are ready for you.

1410
01:28:17,524 --> 01:28:19,927
All right, people, we got a
public hanging coming up next.

1411
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:22,630
So I want lots of-- -
We are tracking off the charts.

1412
01:28:22,662 --> 01:28:24,831
The network is calling
you my protégé.

1413
01:28:24,864 --> 01:28:26,367
I'm proud of you, kiddo.

1414
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:27,868
I would hold that sentiment.

1415
01:28:29,636 --> 01:28:31,472
All right, guys, we've got
a change of plans tonight.

1416
01:28:31,505 --> 01:28:32,806
The hanging man dropped out.

1417
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,007
Oh.

1418
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:37,445
And you didn't think to tell me
until one minute beforehand?

1419
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:38,779
Well, I did,
but I decided not to.

1420
01:28:38,811 --> 01:28:40,381
It will not be a lot
of movement,

1421
01:28:40,413 --> 01:28:44,050
just center stage and here's
Adam's prompter script.

1422
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:45,485
Should I be concerned?

1423
01:28:45,519 --> 01:28:47,088
You probably should be, yeah.

1424
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:49,523
<i>Welcome back
to the season finale</i>

1425
01:28:49,555 --> 01:28:52,025
<i>of This Is Your Death!</i>

1426
01:28:52,059 --> 01:28:55,896
<i>Your host, Adam Rogers!</i>

1427
01:28:55,929 --> 01:28:58,565
<i>Here, on This Is Your Death,</i>

1428
01:28:58,599 --> 01:29:00,768
we have been on a mission
all season long,

1429
01:29:00,801 --> 01:29:04,004
a mission to wake this country
out of its complacency,

1430
01:29:04,037 --> 01:29:05,539
out of its slumber,

1431
01:29:05,572 --> 01:29:08,676
to experience the
reality of the real,

1432
01:29:08,708 --> 01:29:10,677
and tonight is no exception.

1433
01:29:14,715 --> 01:29:17,451
Please welcome our next
brave guest,

1434
01:29:17,484 --> 01:29:21,088
Karina R-- What?

1435
01:29:21,121 --> 01:29:24,759
Keller, cue this video.

1436
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:26,927
Don't.
- Cue the video, Keller.

1437
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,662
<i>This is my crew
and it is my show.</i>

1438
01:29:28,694 --> 01:29:31,164
If you cue that video, Keller,
there will be no show!

1439
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:33,501
No season two, no syndication,

1440
01:29:33,533 --> 01:29:35,835
no international sales, nothing!

1441
01:29:35,868 --> 01:29:38,805
Good! May I remind everyone
that we are still live?

1442
01:29:38,838 --> 01:29:40,807
<i>Keller? -
This is a joke, right?</i>

1443
01:29:40,841 --> 01:29:42,843
<i>Somebody tell me
what's going on.</i>

1444
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:46,046
<i>- Goddammit.
- My name is...</i>

1445
01:29:46,078 --> 01:29:48,416
<i>- Uh, Karina Rogers.
- Are you kidding me?</i>

1446
01:29:48,448 --> 01:29:50,650
<i>I'm the little sister
of Adam Rogers,</i>

1447
01:29:50,684 --> 01:29:53,855
<i>the host and co-creator
of the show.</i>

1448
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:57,992
<i>- What is this?
- Adam and I were closer than most siblings,</i>

1449
01:29:58,024 --> 01:29:59,926
<i>I think, growing up.</i>

1450
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,061
<i>Um, our parents were killed
by a drunk driver</i>

1451
01:30:02,095 --> 01:30:04,865
<i>- when I was 15 and Adam was 20.
- Karina? Karina, no.</i>

1452
01:30:04,898 --> 01:30:08,502
<i>- Adam just dropped everything to take care of me.
- No! Kar-- hey.</i>

1453
01:30:08,534 --> 01:30:10,537
<i>- Sylvia!
- I developed...</i>

1454
01:30:10,570 --> 01:30:13,606
<i>- Karina!
- ...clinical depression.</i>

1455
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,477
<i>- It sucks.
- Karina! Karina!</i>

1456
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:18,679
You're a monster.
- Sylvia!

1457
01:30:18,712 --> 01:30:20,948
No, I'm your protégé, remember?

1458
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:24,217
What, Bernie?

1459
01:30:24,251 --> 01:30:26,753
Listen to me, I got the entire
board on the line here.

1460
01:30:26,787 --> 01:30:29,623
Please, God, tell me
this is a joke.

1461
01:30:29,655 --> 01:30:32,827
<i>...believing he could
change the world.</i>

1462
01:30:32,859 --> 01:30:35,028
<i>He did, I guess.</i>

1463
01:30:35,061 --> 01:30:39,934
<i>Just not the way he intended.</i>

1464
01:30:39,966 --> 01:30:41,801
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

1465
01:30:41,835 --> 01:30:43,971
<i>- Stop this! Stop her!
- I'm doing this for myself.</i>

1466
01:30:44,003 --> 01:30:46,506
<i>- Hey!
- And I'm doing it for Adam.</i>

1467
01:30:46,539 --> 01:30:49,109
<i>And I'm doing it for all of you.</i>

1468
01:30:49,141 --> 01:30:54,747
<i>None of you are watching me
to feel empathy,</i>

1469
01:30:54,780 --> 01:31:00,887
<i>or to be shocked back
into reality.</i>

1470
01:31:00,921 --> 01:31:05,592
<i>You're watching me to see
how I'll off myself.</i>

1471
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:08,596
I hope I'm the last one.

1472
01:31:08,628 --> 01:31:11,131
Karina! Hey!

1473
01:31:11,163 --> 01:31:13,567
Somebody back there, stop her!

1474
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:15,803
Hey! Hey!

1475
01:31:17,270 --> 01:31:18,472
Don't let her do it!

1476
01:31:30,149 --> 01:31:31,618
Back up!

1477
01:31:46,065 --> 01:31:48,202
No! No!

1478
01:31:48,234 --> 01:31:51,771
What're you doing?
What're you doing?

1479
01:31:51,805 --> 01:31:54,842
Somebody call 911!

1480
01:31:54,875 --> 01:31:57,545
Please...
- Tell me, what are you doing?!

1481
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:59,647
Somebody call 911!

1482
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,584
Look... I'm gonna miss you.
- You're all I have left.

1483
01:32:03,617 --> 01:32:05,085
You're the only person
in this world I got left.

1484
01:32:05,118 --> 01:32:07,555
I'm gonna miss you. You're okay.
- What're you doing?

1485
01:32:07,587 --> 01:32:10,224
You're gonna be okay.
- No, no, no!

1486
01:32:10,256 --> 01:32:12,192
No, no, no, no, no!

1487
01:32:12,225 --> 01:32:15,096
No! No!

1488
01:32:29,676 --> 01:32:32,146
Karina. Karina.

1489
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:47,027
Are you happy now?!

1490
01:32:47,060 --> 01:32:49,330
Did you get what you wanted?!

1491
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:51,666
Are you happy now?!

1492
01:32:54,734 --> 01:32:56,836
Get her out of here.

1493
01:32:56,869 --> 01:32:58,671
I'm going on my own.

1494
01:32:58,704 --> 01:33:02,175
Keller, you are in charge.

1495
01:33:02,208 --> 01:33:04,845
Don't say anything, just do
your job and finish this, okay?

1496
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:12,585
Cue the VO and cut
to commercial.

1497
01:33:14,253 --> 01:33:16,689
<i>We'll be right back
after these messages</i>

1498
01:33:16,722 --> 01:33:21,028
<i>for the grand finale
of This Is Your Death!</i>

1499
01:33:32,305 --> 01:33:34,041
It's time.

1500
01:34:08,007 --> 01:34:09,777
Let me go with her!

1501
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:11,412
Let me go with--
What are you doing?

1502
01:34:16,949 --> 01:34:19,086
<i>This next act
involves explosives,</i>

1503
01:34:19,118 --> 01:34:23,023
<i>so everyone please
insert your earplugs.</i>

1504
01:34:23,055 --> 01:34:24,824
We're on in five seconds.

1505
01:34:24,858 --> 01:34:25,926
Four.

1506
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:27,127
Three.

1507
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:32,966
<i>I grew up a few
blocks from here, actually.</i>

1508
01:34:32,998 --> 01:34:35,969
<i>We used to play
on these tracks as kids.</i>

1509
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:40,807
<i>I knew all the steam engines.</i>

1510
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:42,076
<i>I remember one day
in particular,</i>

1511
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:44,411
<i>an old JB-36 steam engine
was rolling through...</i>

1512
01:34:44,444 --> 01:34:45,880
Mason.

1513
01:34:48,215 --> 01:34:49,350
You know him?

1514
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:53,754
He used to clean
our offices, yeah.

1515
01:34:59,059 --> 01:35:01,762
<i>That's what we did to have fun.</i>

1516
01:35:01,795 --> 01:35:03,497
<i>And my childhood was
the kind you lived through</i>

1517
01:35:03,529 --> 01:35:05,965
<i>without ever thinking
there was a way out.</i>

1518
01:35:13,539 --> 01:35:15,208
The point is,

1519
01:35:15,242 --> 01:35:17,277
I made a promise

1520
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:20,013
<i>that if I were to ever
have kids,</i>

1521
01:35:20,046 --> 01:35:22,015
<i>someone to be responsible for,</i>

1522
01:35:22,047 --> 01:35:24,484
<i>they wouldn't have to grow up
in a place like this.</i>

1523
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,823
<i>You know what?</i>

1524
01:35:30,923 --> 01:35:33,260
<i>I did it.
I found a job.</i>

1525
01:35:35,462 --> 01:35:38,165
<i>Got my wife and kids
into a good neighborhood,</i>

1526
01:35:38,198 --> 01:35:42,168
<i>and then that job evaporated
with the economy,</i>

1527
01:35:42,202 --> 01:35:45,038
<i>and I haven't been able
to land anything just to--</i>

1528
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:49,009
Just to make ends meet,
you know?

1529
01:35:53,246 --> 01:35:57,851
All I want to do is work,
be a good father...

1530
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,323
a good husband...

1531
01:36:03,355 --> 01:36:06,426
but I... I'm out of ideas.

1532
01:36:07,927 --> 01:36:09,930
I'm at the end of my rope.

1533
01:36:11,398 --> 01:36:13,367
<i>And I made a promise.</i>

1534
01:36:16,168 --> 01:36:18,005
<i>So I'm here.</i>

1535
01:37:51,931 --> 01:37:53,300
No!

1536
01:37:53,332 --> 01:37:56,036
I'm sorry, I can't do it!

1537
01:37:56,069 --> 01:37:58,472
I can't do it.

1538
01:37:58,505 --> 01:38:01,442
I don't want your money.

1539
01:38:03,009 --> 01:38:07,081
Wha-- what am I doing?

1540
01:38:10,684 --> 01:38:13,554
I love my family.

1541
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:17,358
I love my life.

1542
01:38:18,358 --> 01:38:19,960
I won't do it.

1543
01:38:19,993 --> 01:38:22,195
I won't.

1544
01:38:22,228 --> 01:38:24,030
What are you doing?

1545
01:38:24,064 --> 01:38:27,935
What-- what are you watching?

1546
01:38:29,234 --> 01:38:31,570
I just--
I just wanna go home.

1547
01:38:34,207 --> 01:38:36,510
<i>Can't we just turn it off?</i>

1548
01:38:37,711 --> 01:38:41,181
Can't we all just go home?

1549
01:38:53,659 --> 01:38:55,729
We love you, Mason!

1550
01:38:55,761 --> 01:38:57,630
Yeah!

1551
01:39:08,307 --> 01:39:09,243
Cue the final music.

1552
01:39:09,275 --> 01:39:11,545
Let's get this fucking
show over with.

1553
01:39:11,578 --> 01:39:13,681
Mason! Mason! Mason!

1554
01:39:30,596 --> 01:39:33,500
Just give me a second.

1555
01:39:33,533 --> 01:39:35,202
It's all on there.

1556
01:39:35,234 --> 01:39:37,670
He threatened me if I spoke,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

1557
01:40:07,533 --> 01:40:09,135
There he is!
There's Mason!

1558
01:40:09,168 --> 01:40:10,537
Hey, Mason!

1559
01:40:13,172 --> 01:40:16,609
Right here!
Right here, Mason!

1560
01:40:16,643 --> 01:40:19,413
You let this--

1561
01:40:23,850 --> 01:40:25,285
It's you.

1562
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:50,342
Please stop.

1563
01:40:50,376 --> 01:40:52,412
Get your cameras out of my face.

1564
01:40:52,444 --> 01:40:53,412
Please, stop it!

1565
01:40:53,445 --> 01:40:55,815
Shut it off!

1566
01:40:55,849 --> 01:40:58,518
Shut it off!

1567
01:40:58,551 --> 01:41:00,187
What is wrong with you?

1568
01:41:05,492 --> 01:41:07,627
You're animals!

1569
01:41:07,659 --> 01:41:09,128
You're fucking animals!

1570
01:41:09,162 --> 01:41:11,664
Shut off your cameras!
Shut them off!

1571
01:41:13,132 --> 01:41:14,467
Shut them off!
- Let's go!

1572
01:41:14,501 --> 01:41:16,103
Shut them off!
