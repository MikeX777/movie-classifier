1
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:15,976
Developing news now,
former rap mogul Suge Knight

2
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,870
is headed to prison
for voluntary manslaughter.

3
00:01:18,903 --> 00:01:20,572
He ran down a man
in the parking lot

4
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:22,349
of a Compton burger stand
about three years ago,

5
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,143
and today, he found out what
his punishment's going to be.

6
00:01:25,176 --> 00:01:28,012
For the crime, the defendant
has been convicted in count 1,

7
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:31,222
the defendant's levied a term
in state prison of 22 years.

8
00:01:31,248 --> 00:01:33,651
Prior conviction,
the defendant has admitted

9
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:35,695
he's levied an additional
five years in state prison

10
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,590
for a total,
unstayed term of 28 years.

11
00:01:39,623 --> 00:01:40,824
Quite a fall for Knight

12
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:42,760
since the height
of his career in the '90s.

13
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:45,729
He's best known as the
co-founder of Death Row Records,

14
00:01:45,763 --> 00:01:49,334
and worked with Dr. Dre,
Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur.

15
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:52,904
And back here, live, uh,
Sharon, he did look briefly at...

16
00:01:52,936 --> 00:01:55,373
Suge Knight's sentencing
for 28 years

17
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,241
signaled the end
of his power,

18
00:01:57,274 --> 00:01:58,944
the end of his empire.

19
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:11,122
People now,
no longer as intimidated

20
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:13,090
since Suge's incarceration,

21
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:14,358
started talking more freely

22
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:16,226
about Suge being
the shadow

23
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,263
behind Biggie Smalls'
and Tupac Shakur's murders.

24
00:02:19,295 --> 00:02:21,231
You tell Frankie to call him.

25
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:24,334
Frankie, you called me when she
tells you to call me, Frankie.

26
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:28,840
- Why, why what's...
- Frankie goes to Hollywood.

27
00:02:28,873 --> 00:02:30,308
Hey, yo, Frankie!

28
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,742
Frankie!

29
00:02:31,775 --> 00:02:35,245
- Yo, Frankie!
- What are you...

30
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:37,248
It caused me
to review an earlier film

31
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,083
I'd made about Biggie and Tupac.

32
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:41,953
People were now
opening up to things

33
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:43,887
I couldn't get answered before.

34
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:50,160
Biggie and Tupac started off
as the best of friends.

35
00:02:50,194 --> 00:02:52,696
Tupac was the one
who discovered Biggie

36
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,798
and brought him out on stage.

37
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,404
And if you look very closely,
you'll see the rarest of footage

38
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:05,208
of Biggie and Tupac,
hugging on the edge of stage.

39
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:07,378
But partly because
of Suge's influence,

40
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,946
they ended up as deadly enemies.

41
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,719
The victims of a gang war
that Suge had initiated.

42
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:17,387
It was LAPD detective,
Russell Poole...

43
00:03:17,421 --> 00:03:18,656
- Hey.
- Hello, hello!

44
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,060
...who originally alleged the
connection between Suge Knight

45
00:03:22,093 --> 00:03:23,994
and the murders
of Biggie and Tupac.

46
00:03:24,028 --> 00:03:27,098
Well, like I say,
based on the witnesses

47
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,967
that I've interviewed
and the evidence,

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,704
I believe that Suge Knight

49
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:36,339
ultimately called for the hit.

50
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:38,709
And you said police chief,
Bernard Parks,

51
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:41,179
stopped you
from investigating further

52
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:43,447
because LAPD police officers

53
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:45,083
were involved with Suge Knight?

54
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:46,083
Well, that's correct.

55
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:48,453
Yes, he was, uh, you know...

56
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:51,723
it's several factors

57
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:54,391
on why he didn't
want this pursued

58
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:56,360
to the fullest extent,

59
00:03:56,392 --> 00:03:58,995
and one being the fact that

60
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:02,266
his own officers were involved.

61
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:05,302
At the time,
police chief Bernard Parks

62
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:07,004
dismissed these allegations.

63
00:04:07,036 --> 00:04:08,372
He is totally wrong,

64
00:04:08,404 --> 00:04:11,842
he only worked the task force,
for about four months.

65
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,477
Russell Poole resigned,

66
00:04:13,511 --> 00:04:17,248
asserting massive corruption
in the LAPD.

67
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,317
Tonight's shocking allegations
against the city's top cop.

68
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,352
Former detective Russell Poole
has filed suit

69
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:23,186
against the department.

70
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,223
Poole says he
uncovered dirty cops

71
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:26,857
while investigating
the murders

72
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,861
of rappers Biggie Smalls
and Tupac Shakur.

73
00:04:29,893 --> 00:04:31,963
I provided the chief
with enough...

74
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:34,499
Russell died tragically
a few years later.

75
00:04:34,532 --> 00:04:38,002
His career in tatters,
the murders still unsolved.

76
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:41,472
His work asserting dirty cops
and corruption in the LAPD

77
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:44,341
is as relevant today
as it was then.

78
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:46,944
- Knew I had no...
- I am telling you right now...

79
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:48,279
Book him up,
book him up.

80
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:49,179
You're under arrest.

81
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:51,215
You're under arrest
for interfering.

82
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:23,180
You don't live here, do you?

83
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:51,441
Back in the 1990s,

84
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:54,177
Death Row was the most
successful rap label ever,

85
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,114
worth hundreds
of millions of dollars.

86
00:05:58,148 --> 00:06:01,619
Yet, by 2002, with allegations
of racketeering,

87
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:05,388
it is closed down by a SWAT team
and goes into bankruptcy.

88
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:10,227
Death Row Records
was in a very elegant part

89
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:13,497
of Westwood in Los Angeles.

90
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,934
It was really a big office

91
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,304
and it was located
across the hall

92
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:23,440
from Interscope Records.

93
00:06:24,472 --> 00:06:27,611
When you first walk
into Death Row Records,

94
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:33,885
you got a vibe that it was
a family kinda thing going on,

95
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:37,321
that everybody cared
about everybody.

96
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:40,957
So, you kinda got fooled,
right off the bat.

97
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:45,128
Now, what I did notice
the very first time

98
00:06:45,162 --> 00:06:49,100
was that there was
always a lot of guys.

99
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:52,103
When I say lot of guys
I mean, they would be lined up,

100
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:54,537
sitting in the hallway,
chillin'.

101
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:56,908
You didn't know
why they were there.

102
00:06:56,941 --> 00:06:59,343
I don't even think
they knew why they were there.

103
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:03,314
You know, but Suge did give
a lotta jobs to the guys,

104
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:08,052
his gang member
affiliation people.

105
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:11,422
It was funny,
they always had on red.

106
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:14,592
Everybody that was
everybody had on red.

107
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:16,626
And Snoop and 'em
always wore their blue.

108
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,429
They never got off their Crip.

109
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,934
You used to come in
the office, right?

110
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:26,170
And there'd be
a gang of dudes up there.

111
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:29,140
Bloods, I can always tell
they Bloods, right?

112
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:32,042
Um, smoking...

113
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,177
Newports.

114
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,379
Where they'll pop the thing off.

115
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:38,482
Or the Camels, right?

116
00:07:38,514 --> 00:07:42,018
They pop the head off
the Newport, right?

117
00:07:42,052 --> 00:07:44,422
And, and you could tell
that they'd had just been

118
00:07:44,455 --> 00:07:45,665
in the penitentiary
for a long time,

119
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:48,259
'cause they just
so used to sittin' down,

120
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:52,063
smoking weed
or them cigarettes, right.

121
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:53,997
Talking shit.

122
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,367
And then, it'd be like,
new crews of cats

123
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,170
you could tell
fresh out the pen,

124
00:07:59,203 --> 00:08:02,039
come up there to get a job.

125
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:05,108
First thing they gonna
ask you, "Where you from?"

126
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:10,380
And you better not say you're
from an enemy gang territory.

127
00:08:10,413 --> 00:08:14,184
Or they gonna say
you gonna have to run it.

128
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:15,251
You see what I'm sayin'?

129
00:08:15,285 --> 00:08:17,021
You know what I mean by run it?

130
00:08:17,054 --> 00:08:19,390
They gonna want,
they want to fight.

131
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,650
We come from a good,
tight knit family.

132
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:40,311
Really, really close.

133
00:08:40,343 --> 00:08:41,578
Everyone loves each other.

134
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:44,248
Everyone thinks with one brain.

135
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,150
Parents are still together.

136
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:48,718
And we're just, you know,
just like a regular family.

137
00:08:48,751 --> 00:08:53,524
Uncle Suge was the baby,
so he got away with everything.

138
00:08:53,556 --> 00:08:55,592
So, he's spoiled, he's the baby.

139
00:08:55,626 --> 00:09:00,463
He would call my mom
and ask for, certain...

140
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:02,699
you know, his potato salad,
a certain way.

141
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:05,669
He wants chicken
his certain way.

142
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:08,405
He wants, you know... and if
anybody touches his chicken,

143
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:10,307
his potato salad, he's angry.

144
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:12,142
You know, he wants
his food a certain way.

145
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:14,811
He wants it...
I mean he's the baby.

146
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:17,380
So, and everybody loves him
and they spoil him,

147
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:19,216
especially my mom.

148
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:21,751
So, whatever he says is,
"Okay, Suge.

149
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:23,820
Okay, little Suge, okay."

150
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:26,623
So, he's, he's, he's,
you know what I mean?

151
00:09:26,656 --> 00:09:29,727
He's the baby so he gets
whatever he wants.

152
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,828
Happy Mother's Day from OFTB

153
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,664
and all other mothers out there.

154
00:09:33,697 --> 00:09:36,734
Stay strong, stay up.

155
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:39,335
There is also
another side to Suge.

156
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:42,305
He initially gave hope
to the Compton community,

157
00:09:42,338 --> 00:09:45,342
which had the highest
unemployment in LA.

158
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,477
He also gave back
to the community.

159
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:26,283
Suge gave encouragement
to artists like Danny Boy,

160
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:29,219
whom he adopted
as legal guardian, age 15,

161
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:31,421
and acted as a father.

162
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:32,323
Yes, he was.

163
00:10:32,356 --> 00:10:34,158
For sure, for sure.

164
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:37,393
Definitely like a father,
like a big brother to me.

165
00:10:37,426 --> 00:10:40,430
A lot of things that
people seen in Suge,

166
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:44,434
or a lot of things that
people said about Suge,

167
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:47,704
you know,
some of those things, I...

168
00:10:47,737 --> 00:10:49,339
you know,
I didn't see him as that.

169
00:10:49,372 --> 00:10:50,340
You know what I mean?

170
00:10:50,373 --> 00:10:52,542
Because, I had a real
relationship with him

171
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:55,345
where I felt like I was able to,
kinda, talk to him

172
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:58,748
and say things that a son
would say to a father.

173
00:10:58,781 --> 00:10:59,816
Yeah, so...

174
00:11:03,953 --> 00:11:06,189
Suge lived in Compton
near Pam Brooks,

175
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:07,525
an old friend of mine,

176
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:10,194
and whom I asked
to work on the film.

177
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:10,861
Hi there.

178
00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:11,896
Pam knows everyone.

179
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:13,363
Hi.

180
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:14,873
Tell me what you know
about Suge Knight.

181
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:15,565
All right.

182
00:11:15,598 --> 00:11:17,667
Now what does you need to know?

183
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,235
Suge Knight is on that side.

184
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:21,605
His... this is
the Crip neighborhood.

185
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:24,307
Suge Knight is over there off
of Wilmington and Rosecrans

186
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:25,543
all the way down.

187
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:27,243
Do you know some of his homies?

188
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:30,280
Yeah, I'ma, I'ma get you...
let you talk to 'em.

189
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,817
Yeah, I mean, and if they don't
wanna talk or be on camera,

190
00:11:33,849 --> 00:11:35,319
can they just...
I need to...

191
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:36,462
they don't have
to be on camera

192
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:37,821
if they don't wanna
be on camera.

193
00:11:37,853 --> 00:11:39,857
Just... I need...
would they mind if we...

194
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,925
they record their voice?

195
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,196
Just, um-

196
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:51,735
All right, call me and...

197
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:55,439
Just call me
and let me know and then,

198
00:11:55,472 --> 00:11:57,274
let me know, and...

199
00:11:57,306 --> 00:11:58,274
I don't know,
these are England...

200
00:11:58,308 --> 00:12:00,544
they white people,
they white but they Black.

201
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:02,213
But, I mean,
they're from England.

202
00:12:02,246 --> 00:12:03,380
- I mean...
- All right.

203
00:12:03,413 --> 00:12:07,251
No, um, no, you know,
we straight up.

204
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:13,656
They're from England.

205
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:14,992
Remember, they're crazy.

206
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,361
Yeah.

207
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:19,630
This is the first time
Lipp Dogg speaks

208
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:22,466
about working for Suge Knight.

209
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:26,237
And so, before you worked
at Death Row, you were?

210
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:28,505
I was in prison...

211
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:31,408
for attempted murder.

212
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,444
And so, Suge offered you a job?

213
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:34,845
Right.

214
00:12:36,847 --> 00:12:38,515
Offered me.

215
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:40,551
And how did that happen?

216
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,020
Well, when I got...
when I came home,

217
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,357
one of my associates
took me to where Suge was at.

218
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,559
Suge was about to go out of town

219
00:12:48,592 --> 00:12:52,263
and before he boarded a plane,

220
00:12:52,295 --> 00:12:54,297
me and him hooked up.

221
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,466
Because I know Suge
prior from then.

222
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,936
I know Suge ever
since the early '70s

223
00:12:58,968 --> 00:13:01,504
'cause we grew up
five houses from each other.

224
00:13:01,538 --> 00:13:04,508
So, you know,
he knew me.

225
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,508
Suge couldn't
play with us.

226
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,944
His mother wouldn't
let him play with us.

227
00:13:07,977 --> 00:13:12,882
'Cause we were the thugs
in the neighborhood.

228
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:15,352
And she had a goal for Suge

229
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:16,987
and that was for him
to play sports.

230
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:37,540
Marion Knight, number 54.

231
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:39,075
Suge went to college.

232
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:41,679
And, and, you know,
he had good parents.

233
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:45,082
He had both his mother
and father that kept him away

234
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:49,687
from the whole gang violence
shit that we was doin'.

235
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:53,022
Sometime they'd think
and he'd think that's hard,

236
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:54,023
you took away that from me.

237
00:13:54,056 --> 00:13:57,093
No, she gave you a better life.

238
00:13:57,126 --> 00:13:59,729
Being in office was just like

239
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:02,098
conducting business
on the street.

240
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:04,968
Motherfucker got in the way,
a motherfucker got dealt with.

241
00:14:05,001 --> 00:14:08,771
If you thought you was
goin' to create a problem,

242
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:09,673
you had a problem.

243
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:13,643
You find yourself
tossed upside down.

244
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:15,912
One thing people knew
about Death Row

245
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:19,449
is they wasn't bullshitting
and they will whoop your ass

246
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:21,352
with no questions asked.

247
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:24,855
If you stepped on the red rug,

248
00:14:24,887 --> 00:14:26,556
if you answer the phone,

249
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:29,459
if you parked
in somebody's spot,

250
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:31,462
you gonna get
your ass whooped.

251
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,997
Some people died.

252
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:39,435
Some people just got beat up,
you know, uh...

253
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:41,438
few people got rap pacts.

254
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:45,742
You know, when I say people
got disciplined,

255
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:50,747
they got in the way
or Death Row was on a mission.

256
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,117
You couldn't stand on the logo.

257
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,318
The Death Row logo.

258
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:58,922
Stood on that logo, you're
probably gonna get knocked out.

259
00:14:58,954 --> 00:15:01,525
And no telling who
gonna knock you out,

260
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:03,827
but you probably
got knocked out.

261
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:05,461
You had a dog, Damu.

262
00:15:05,495 --> 00:15:07,431
Suge's German Shepherd.

263
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:09,031
His name was Damu.

264
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:11,434
It mean blood, you know.

265
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:13,035
The dog would attack you.

266
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:15,872
How it was trained.

267
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:17,940
'Cause it thinking,
the dog thinking

268
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:21,444
you tryin' to get next to him,
next to Suge.

269
00:15:21,477 --> 00:15:22,655
And if you tryin'
to get next to Suge,

270
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,081
that dog is gonna attack you.

271
00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:25,948
You know?

272
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:28,886
And is it true he had,
like, piranha fish?

273
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:31,922
Yeah, he had a black tank

274
00:15:31,954 --> 00:15:35,458
built into the wall
in his office.

275
00:15:35,492 --> 00:15:36,860
And it was dark...

276
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:40,062
it was black piranhas.

277
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:41,698
We used to feed 'em blood worms.

278
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:44,735
He used to buy a big pack
of blood worms

279
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:47,737
and put 'em in there
and they'd just go crazy.

280
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,209
Yeah.

281
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,945
No, they, and he'd,
he'd look at that,

282
00:15:55,978 --> 00:15:58,781
at that, at that tank

283
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:01,984
and look at you,

284
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:06,589
then you know, people,
they was calm.

285
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,676
They were gang bangers.

286
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:29,679
They were gang bangers
and they worked for Suge Knight.

287
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:32,149
So, they was, like,
Suge Knight's boys.

288
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:35,017
So, I believe...
my belief of it is

289
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,086
they did what Suge
told them to do.

290
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,956
Because they was broke,
they're...

291
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:41,557
they couldn't get a job
because they was already marked

292
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:45,496
as gang bangers so they took
their ride with Suge Knight.

293
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:46,864
And they accepted that 1,000.

294
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:49,165
That 1,000... for a person
that never had no-

295
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:50,867
for a person
that don't have nothin',

296
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,703
a $1,000 is good day.

297
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:55,506
$1,000 a day
to do some dirty shit

298
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:57,107
to the next motherfucker.

299
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,674
Or go over here
and drop this car off

300
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,511
or go over here
and drop this bag off.

301
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:01,554
And you don't know
what's in the bag,

302
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:04,515
but 9 out of 10,
you know what's in the bag.

303
00:17:04,548 --> 00:17:06,683
Because you not gonna
fuck with nobody.

304
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:09,019
You know, you not gonna put
yourself in a situation

305
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:12,555
where you don't know if it's
a dead body in a trunk or not.

306
00:17:12,588 --> 00:17:13,689
Some people do.

307
00:17:13,723 --> 00:17:15,791
Some motherfuckers
don't give a fuck.

308
00:17:15,824 --> 00:17:16,892
You know what I'm sayin'?

309
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:18,725
Because they'd be so desperate
for this money.

310
00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:24,133
Inflicting pain on people was,
was like my medicine.

311
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,936
It was... I felt good.

312
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,806
I, I truly felt good about it.

313
00:17:29,838 --> 00:17:32,809
I took pleasure into it.

314
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:37,179
Okay, I mean, just the...
seeing the blood,

315
00:17:37,213 --> 00:17:41,952
how it, it came out your nose,
how it came out your ears.

316
00:17:41,984 --> 00:17:44,954
You, you, you don't wanna die.

317
00:17:44,988 --> 00:17:46,623
You don't wanna die.

318
00:17:46,655 --> 00:17:50,027
These cats don't give a fuck
if they do die.

319
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:51,361
And, and I mean that like that.

320
00:17:51,395 --> 00:17:55,933
I'm not puttin' 'em on nothing,
but these cats don't care.

321
00:17:55,965 --> 00:17:57,067
You know what I'm sayin'?

322
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:58,569
We lose homies in prison,

323
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:01,737
we lose homies on the street
on the daily.

324
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:03,941
We done seen death.

325
00:18:03,973 --> 00:18:04,875
We done seen it.

326
00:18:04,907 --> 00:18:06,208
I held it.

327
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:07,376
You know what I'm sayin?

328
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:11,881
I watched my homeboy Kenny
Chuggs take his last breath.

329
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:14,050
Like, wow.

330
00:18:14,084 --> 00:18:16,953
Mob James recruited
gang members for Suge,

331
00:18:16,986 --> 00:18:20,089
including Buntry,
his younger brother.

332
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:24,828
Tupac would rap about Buntry
who would later be murdered.

333
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,665
Suge utilized
each and every, every guy

334
00:18:29,699 --> 00:18:31,935
that, that I brung to him.

335
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:35,071
Instead of him being
the businessman he shoulda been,

336
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:38,275
he turned into
one of the homies.

337
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:41,278
Shit, Suge put on a red suit,

338
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,347
the big rings, the cigars,

339
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:45,314
and he just changed.

340
00:18:45,348 --> 00:18:48,885
He went from Marion

341
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:52,989
to, to, to this gangster.

342
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:55,992
And, and, and I say

343
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:59,363
some men can't take power
like that,

344
00:18:59,396 --> 00:19:01,697
and, and, and just know

345
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:04,300
that they have all that
power and be good.

346
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:05,969
Suge took that power.

347
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:07,203
He felt the energy.

348
00:19:07,236 --> 00:19:09,905
He felt, like...
just say, for instance,

349
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:13,209
going into a concert and
you got 20 Bloods behind you.

350
00:19:13,242 --> 00:19:15,145
I'm the smallest one.

351
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:17,246
Everybody else is, is,

352
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,415
I'm talking about like,
like big.

353
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:22,152
And everybody mentality is,

354
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:24,253
if anybody say something
to Suge,

355
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,156
knock their,
knock their fucking head off.

356
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,794
And all of these famous people
was lookin'

357
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:33,163
and seein' Suge's entourage

358
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:36,098
and it was, it was like
he was Jesus.

359
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:38,068
Everybody just start
parting away,

360
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,203
and we would walk through
that crowd.

361
00:19:40,235 --> 00:19:43,906
And Suge,

362
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,275
he felt it.

363
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:47,176
But it was just too much
for him.

364
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,280
At the end of the day,
it was too much.

365
00:19:50,312 --> 00:19:53,049
Put your hands together
and say, oh yeah!

366
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:54,050
- Oh yeah!
- Oh yeah!

367
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:57,688
Lemme see somebody give Dre,
Suge and D.O.C.

368
00:19:57,721 --> 00:19:58,922
a round of applause.

369
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:03,159
Death Row Records is gonna be
the record company of the 2000s!

370
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:04,860
Death Row had the money to throw

371
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:07,931
the most lavish celebrity
parties in Beverly Hills.

372
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:12,301
The label started with,
uh, Dr. Dre,

373
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:14,171
who was gonna his own thing,

374
00:20:14,203 --> 00:20:16,440
and, uh, with a lotta help
from Suge Knight...

375
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:20,010
David Kenner, seen here,
and Suge Knight, ran Death Row.

376
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:23,847
According to employees,
they did whatever they wanted.

377
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:27,383
Beverly Rollis,
front and center.

378
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:30,386
He had huge houses.

379
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,088
He had lots of cars.

380
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:36,158
He could come to work every day
in a different car for a month

381
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:39,496
and never drive the same car.

382
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,998
Really?

383
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,367
To be honest,
Suge was just two-faced.

384
00:20:45,401 --> 00:20:49,239
He was two-faced
and he really wasn't

385
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:52,174
a man of his word.

386
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:55,878
And I'm tellin' you, that day
that he set me up to be beat up,

387
00:20:55,912 --> 00:20:59,516
I never thought...
I had no inkling

388
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,885
that that was gonna happen
that day.

389
00:21:01,917 --> 00:21:03,919
He had planned that whole thing
all weekend.

390
00:21:03,953 --> 00:21:06,289
He was ready.

391
00:21:06,321 --> 00:21:10,159
He had one of his girlfriends
bring the girl up to the office.

392
00:21:10,193 --> 00:21:12,261
They snuck her through
the back door.

393
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:14,430
The girl that jumped on me,
she was dropped off

394
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:17,333
by a girl that was one
of his girlfriends.

395
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:21,437
This girl came outta nowhere
and she sucker-punched me.

396
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:23,973
Stomping me in my face.

397
00:21:24,007 --> 00:21:26,343
And Suge had me by my feet,

398
00:21:26,376 --> 00:21:28,511
and David Kenner
just stood and watched.

399
00:21:28,544 --> 00:21:30,412
And what did Suge say?

400
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:32,549
He was holdin' my feet.

401
00:21:32,581 --> 00:21:34,885
So then, when I kicked him
in his nuts,

402
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,853
that's when I got familiar
with the back door.

403
00:21:37,886 --> 00:21:41,157
So, when I ran out the back door
and I ran over to Interscope,

404
00:21:41,191 --> 00:21:44,327
they musta knew somethin'
was happening,

405
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,397
because they locked the door,
so you couldn't go in.

406
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:49,866
You know, they treated women...

407
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:51,410
I mean, they would have
fights in there,

408
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:53,369
girl fights, in the offices

409
00:21:53,403 --> 00:21:55,905
where they would put the
assistants against other women

410
00:21:55,938 --> 00:21:58,240
and they'd like...
like, literal girl fights

411
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:01,110
where they would open up... like,
in the middle of the floor.

412
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:04,114
Where they would... like it was
like boxing matches

413
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:05,549
where women would fight.

414
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:07,983
And I just...
I never saw the fights,

415
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:09,027
they would just tell me
about them.

416
00:22:09,051 --> 00:22:10,920
Dre told me about 'em,
and I was just like,

417
00:22:10,953 --> 00:22:13,522
"Who does that in the offices
of the..." whatever.

418
00:22:13,556 --> 00:22:15,959
And so, that's how little
they thought of women.

419
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:19,896
And so, I, I never...
I just never understood it.

420
00:22:19,928 --> 00:22:22,565
I just... they just thought women
were second class citizens.

421
00:22:22,598 --> 00:22:26,302
They were just literally there
for their amusement,

422
00:22:26,336 --> 00:22:29,205
entertainment, and enjoyment.

423
00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:30,273
Nothing else.

424
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:33,109
And if you dated one of them,

425
00:22:33,142 --> 00:22:34,578
you understood
that was your place.

426
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:39,515
What about DJ Quick?

427
00:22:39,549 --> 00:22:41,885
No?

428
00:22:41,917 --> 00:22:43,386
What an insult to them.

429
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:45,988
No.

430
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:48,258
'Cause they still in the life.

431
00:22:50,126 --> 00:22:53,864
Let's call Joe Cool
and see what he got going on.

432
00:22:53,896 --> 00:22:58,400
Pam showed me some useful tips
I hadn't learned at film school.

433
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:01,203
Pam is friends with Joe Cool,
Snoop's cousin,

434
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:02,973
who'd been hard to get.

435
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:04,206
Oh yeah.

436
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,243
I got a good plot
goin' on in my head.

437
00:23:07,277 --> 00:23:08,311
A good plan?

438
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:09,479
Plot, no, you gotta plot.

439
00:23:09,511 --> 00:23:13,415
This is... you gotta plot
with motherfuckers like this.

440
00:23:13,449 --> 00:23:15,418
You wanna play hardball,
let's play.

441
00:23:15,451 --> 00:23:17,654
So, what's your plot tomorrow?

442
00:23:17,686 --> 00:23:20,389
Well, I'll go get the...
get rid of her,

443
00:23:20,423 --> 00:23:25,261
go get the... go get my friend
and then go out there,

444
00:23:25,294 --> 00:23:28,898
get some weed, smoke that,
and go out there and,

445
00:23:28,932 --> 00:23:31,568
you know, rub my titties
against him 'cause he likes me.

446
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,203
I just gotta play the game.

447
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:38,507
Pam and Joe Cool go way back.

448
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,477
He's a Crip and worked
with Snoop, his cousin.

449
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:43,646
At Death Row,
there's an uneasy alliance

450
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,249
between Blood
and Crip gang members.

451
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:49,418
Suge is a Blood,
Snoop and Joe Cool are Crips.

452
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:54,391
These dudes that Suge had
were known Crip killers.

453
00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:56,358
Uh, real rough motherfuckers,

454
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:58,228
ex smokers.

455
00:23:58,261 --> 00:23:59,930
You know what I'm sayin'?

456
00:23:59,963 --> 00:24:03,266
Ex cons, fresh out
the penitentiary motherfuckers.

457
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:04,334
They did not play.

458
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:06,168
They overdid their job.

459
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:07,636
And they robbed and they stole.

460
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:10,139
They pillaged
and they plundered.

461
00:24:10,173 --> 00:24:11,540
And I've seen them do it.

462
00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:13,209
One of their favorite things
is this,

463
00:24:13,242 --> 00:24:15,377
as far as them
being security for Suge.

464
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:17,681
Their favorite thing
would be to do this,

465
00:24:17,713 --> 00:24:21,684
Suge's boys, they were thieves,
robbers, murders, rapists.

466
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:24,954
I'm telling you,
it was Compton's worst.

467
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:26,523
And so, what he would do is...

468
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:30,527
what they would do is,
"He got a gun!"

469
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,662
It might be a guy with
a big chain on, right?

470
00:24:32,694 --> 00:24:37,099
Big old chain on
or a gang of jewelry on,

471
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,970
and they'll point him out and
they like, "Oh, he got a gun!"

472
00:24:40,002 --> 00:24:43,173
Next thing I know,
everybody jumps on this dude.

473
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:44,573
When the dude come up,

474
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:48,345
he ain't got no jewelry,
no wallet, might not...

475
00:24:48,377 --> 00:24:51,580
might be missing a few teeth,
you know what I'm sayin'?

476
00:24:51,614 --> 00:24:56,219
Disorientated and just left
there in a bloody mess.

477
00:24:56,251 --> 00:24:58,288
And they would do that
all the time.

478
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:10,266
It was drugs up there.

479
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:12,668
It was, you know, drug dealings.

480
00:25:12,702 --> 00:25:16,740
It was like multiple suitcases
with powdered cocaine

481
00:25:16,772 --> 00:25:19,675
or, or, re-rocked cocaine
up in there, it was a lot.

482
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:23,146
I've seen, I've seen things

483
00:25:23,178 --> 00:25:25,415
and I've been handed things,
you know?

484
00:25:28,251 --> 00:25:31,087
Russell Poole had said
this years before.

485
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,625
He alleged that dirty cops were
an essential part of Death Row.

486
00:25:35,657 --> 00:25:38,127
It was no secret
that Death Row Records,

487
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:42,032
uh, was involved
in drug trafficking.

488
00:25:42,065 --> 00:25:44,434
The big piece of this
is the fact that

489
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:48,670
we had police officers
working in the organization.

490
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:51,774
And police officers
on different levels, you know.

491
00:25:51,808 --> 00:25:54,411
There was actual security guards

492
00:25:54,444 --> 00:25:57,780
that were actually doing
security for various artists,

493
00:25:57,813 --> 00:26:00,582
and then you had, like,
these confidants,

494
00:26:00,616 --> 00:26:04,354
which I believe, uh, Gaines,

495
00:26:04,386 --> 00:26:09,059
and Mack and Perez
were part of that crew.

496
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:13,396
They were willing to do anything
for Suge Knight.

497
00:26:13,428 --> 00:26:15,397
102 is Dave Mack of America-

498
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:16,499
David Mack, in blue,

499
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:18,667
before he became
a police officer,

500
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:22,271
was a world-class athlete.

501
00:26:22,305 --> 00:26:23,473
David Mack, 5.

502
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:27,176
By complete chance, Tupac's
manager, helped train him.

503
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,612
Leila has avoided
talking about David Mack

504
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:31,748
for the past 24 years.

505
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:35,385
I was working with Olympic
track and field athletes

506
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:36,352
in the early '80s.

507
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:40,123
So, David Mack,
who ended up being the cop

508
00:26:40,155 --> 00:26:43,725
that was entangled with Suge
and everything,

509
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:45,862
he was one of the athletes
on the team.

510
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:51,367
I worked on David Mack
in '82, '83, '84.

511
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:53,469
The Olympics were in 1984.

512
00:26:53,502 --> 00:26:55,838
And I knew David very well,
'cause we worked together

513
00:26:55,871 --> 00:26:58,607
for years before
he was an officer.

514
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,345
So, um, I can't speak
to all the things

515
00:27:03,378 --> 00:27:04,780
that went on and what they did.

516
00:27:04,813 --> 00:27:07,249
All I can tell you is
you cannot run

517
00:27:07,282 --> 00:27:11,521
a criminal enterprise,
at that magnitude,

518
00:27:11,553 --> 00:27:16,325
without a certain level

519
00:27:16,358 --> 00:27:19,462
of compliance
with the police department.

520
00:27:23,465 --> 00:27:26,735
It was David Mack who introduced
fellow LAPD officer

521
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:30,240
Rafael Perez to Suge Knight.

522
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:33,376
Perez actively dealt
in narcotics.

523
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:36,545
The police did this you
controlling the street gangs.

524
00:27:36,578 --> 00:27:40,716
They ran from us and discarded
the narcotics in the gutter.

525
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:42,519
It was no big deal to us.

526
00:27:42,551 --> 00:27:43,785
We'll just put dope on you.

527
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:45,687
We know you had it.

528
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:47,857
Here, Perez confesses
to stealing

529
00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:49,858
over a million dollars
of cocaine

530
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:51,861
from the LAPD evidence locker.

531
00:27:51,894 --> 00:27:54,263
...having violated
several vows and oaths...

532
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:57,467
He implicates a further 70
other police officers

533
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,737
in crimes ranging from
murder, beatings,

534
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:04,406
trafficking narcotics,
filing false police reports,

535
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,342
and lying on the witness stand.

536
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,915
This is police chief
Bernard Parks.

537
00:28:11,947 --> 00:28:16,552
The city of LA ended up paying
an estimated $125 million

538
00:28:16,586 --> 00:28:19,822
in settlement claims.

539
00:28:19,855 --> 00:28:22,424
Do you think Chief Parks
tried to influence

540
00:28:22,457 --> 00:28:26,662
the investigation
into David Mack and Perez?

541
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:31,701
Well, the evidence
that was presented to us

542
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:35,405
clearly showed
that there were attempts

543
00:28:35,437 --> 00:28:37,806
at the highest level
of the department

544
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:39,908
to make things disappear.

545
00:28:39,942 --> 00:28:42,612
I will say that he did
way beyond

546
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:45,415
what anybody would've expected
of a chief of police.

547
00:28:45,447 --> 00:28:48,317
Way beyond.

548
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,919
There's strong evidence
that Rafael Perez, Nino Durden,

549
00:28:50,953 --> 00:28:53,889
and David Mack,
seen here in Blood colors

550
00:28:53,923 --> 00:28:55,924
as well as being
police officers,

551
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:59,995
were members of the Mob Piru
Blood gang, as was Suge Knight.

552
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,531
They and other members
of the police department

553
00:29:02,565 --> 00:29:05,468
controlled the streets
with a reign of terror.

554
00:29:18,347 --> 00:29:20,916
Yeah, pad down, down the waist,
around the waistline.

555
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,761
Put 'em behind your back,
lie down!

556
00:29:32,794 --> 00:29:36,031
The streets are controlled by
the biggest gang that we have,

557
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,034
and that's the police.

558
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,168
And those gang members,

559
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:43,338
many of whom didn't end up
serving on the streets,

560
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:44,906
they became officers.

561
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,444
What are the requirements
to become a police officer?

562
00:29:48,476 --> 00:29:50,379
Not a whole lot.

563
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,815
The corrupt police

564
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:57,654
are facilitating
the distribution of drugs.

565
00:29:57,686 --> 00:30:00,522
There's no way in the world

566
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:03,393
you can have
the mass amount of drugs

567
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:08,530
if not for police
allowing stuff to come in.

568
00:30:10,031 --> 00:30:12,635
And into this messy
and volatile situation

569
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:15,437
of gangs, violence,
and corrupt police

570
00:30:15,471 --> 00:30:17,807
came Tupac Shakur,
who had himself

571
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,542
just come out of prison
on assault charges

572
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:24,380
and would fuel the fire
of Death Row even more.

573
00:30:24,413 --> 00:30:27,849
Tupac would be dead
within 11 months.

574
00:30:27,883 --> 00:30:28,918
Ah, look.

575
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,560
This is Tupac Shakur with
his producer, Tracy Robinson,

576
00:30:38,594 --> 00:30:41,698
who says that none of it
needed to go the way it did.

577
00:30:41,731 --> 00:30:43,900
When I went to visit him
in Dannemora,

578
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:47,403
I think he would not
have gone to Death Row

579
00:30:47,435 --> 00:30:50,505
if Interscope
had just stepped up.

580
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:54,376
Anyone from, uh,

581
00:30:54,409 --> 00:30:56,678
probably Interscope could've
got him out of jail.

582
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:57,613
You know?

583
00:30:57,646 --> 00:30:59,514
Tom Molly could've got him
out of jail.

584
00:30:59,548 --> 00:31:01,818
Jimmy Iovine could've got him
out of jail.

585
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:05,954
He was on their label,
Interscope.

586
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:09,125
So, Death Row was a subsidiary,

587
00:31:09,157 --> 00:31:12,094
as you know, of Interscope,

588
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:16,031
and if Interscope people
had've got him out of jail,

589
00:31:16,065 --> 00:31:19,769
it would be
a whole different scenario.

590
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:21,937
But instead
he's stuck in a situation

591
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:24,906
with some people
who are gang people.

592
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,909
What did you think of Suge?

593
00:31:26,942 --> 00:31:29,545
I don't know Suge,
so I can't speak

594
00:31:29,578 --> 00:31:31,513
on his behalf at all, you know.

595
00:31:31,547 --> 00:31:32,915
I don't know him.

596
00:31:32,947 --> 00:31:35,851
Uh, and,

597
00:31:35,885 --> 00:31:38,921
I just know the energy
that I've got from him

598
00:31:38,953 --> 00:31:42,692
from the time
that I had to deal with him.

599
00:31:42,724 --> 00:31:45,761
It's not pleasant,
it's just not.

600
00:31:45,794 --> 00:31:48,864
And, you know, it's not,
it's not pleasant

601
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:50,665
for me to have to
even talk about.

602
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:53,503
'Cause he's alive,
his down line is alive.

603
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,112
You know, his people are alive,
you know.

604
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,304
These people are revengeful.

605
00:31:56,338 --> 00:31:58,483
This is the kind of stuff
I'm just saying to you right now

606
00:31:58,507 --> 00:32:02,178
like, I wouldn't even want
this on tape because,

607
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,146
like, I live here, I'm alive.

608
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,982
Like I says yo,
I'm alive, I'm walking.

609
00:32:06,014 --> 00:32:09,551
People are still getting shot
for no fucking reason.

610
00:32:09,585 --> 00:32:11,187
You know what I mean,
like, it's...

611
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,557
that gang shit is...
it's ridiculous.

612
00:32:14,589 --> 00:32:15,958
It's ridiculous.

613
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:18,927
Sup, Hammer?

614
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:21,164
There he comes!

615
00:32:21,196 --> 00:32:23,732
He took it very hard.

616
00:32:23,765 --> 00:32:26,701
He felt more
of an impending doom

617
00:32:26,734 --> 00:32:29,972
having signed with Death Row.

618
00:32:30,004 --> 00:32:31,940
'Cause even while
he was in jail,

619
00:32:31,973 --> 00:32:35,544
people were telling him
not to sign with Death Row.

620
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,885
Yaasmyn Fula raised Tupac,
but rarely speaks.

621
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:45,588
She knew Tupac
better than anyone.

622
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,156
Here she is visiting Tupac
in prison.

623
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:53,729
Having just been released
from prison,

624
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:56,999
and now he's signed
with Death Row Records,

625
00:32:57,031 --> 00:33:00,970
he had to continue to
bask in this

626
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:03,872
being part of that
gangster element

627
00:33:03,905 --> 00:33:05,073
when he really wasn't.

628
00:33:05,107 --> 00:33:07,609
Tupac was not a gangster.

629
00:33:07,643 --> 00:33:10,213
That had a very negative effect

630
00:33:10,245 --> 00:33:13,582
on the positive things
he was trying to accomplish.

631
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,826
You know, here you are,
you're a gangster

632
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:19,488
or you're relishing in this
persona of being a gangster.

633
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:22,992
You're associating with people
throwing up gang signs,

634
00:33:23,024 --> 00:33:28,530
making music that glorifies
the gangster ethic,

635
00:33:28,563 --> 00:33:30,832
you know, and debases women.

636
00:33:30,866 --> 00:33:33,502
You know, so, there were
so many contradictions

637
00:33:33,536 --> 00:33:35,171
that he had to overcome

638
00:33:35,203 --> 00:33:37,874
before he could even achieve
the things

639
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:40,542
that he really wanted
to achieve.

640
00:33:40,576 --> 00:33:44,914
He wanted to address the issues

641
00:33:44,946 --> 00:33:48,550
of poverty, despair,

642
00:33:48,584 --> 00:33:51,187
drug addiction.

643
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,954
It's hard to equate the image

644
00:33:52,988 --> 00:33:55,291
that Tupac presented
at Death Row

645
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:59,028
with the young idealistic,
politically motivated Tupac,

646
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,597
the son of a Black Panther.

647
00:34:01,629 --> 00:34:05,133
We're not being taught to deal
with the world as it is.

648
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:07,669
We're being taught to deal
with this fairyland,

649
00:34:07,703 --> 00:34:10,006
which we're not even
living in anymore.

650
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:12,708
Uh, and it's, it's sad.

651
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:15,578
'Cause I'm telling you and it
should not be me telling you.

652
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,146
It should be common knowledge.

653
00:34:17,178 --> 00:34:20,649
Aren't they wondering
why death rates are going up

654
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,052
and suicide is going up
an drug abu...

655
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:24,086
aren't they wondering?

656
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:26,255
Don't they understand
that more people are...

657
00:34:26,288 --> 00:34:28,991
I mean, more kids
are being handed crack

658
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:30,692
than they're being
handed diplomas?

659
00:34:30,726 --> 00:34:33,796
I mean... shouldn't...
I mean like, okay,

660
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:36,832
in school we're learning
to analyze and then...

661
00:34:36,864 --> 00:34:39,267
well, I learned it now,
they should relearn it.

662
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,837
I think adults should
go through school again.

663
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:44,139
You know, I think that...

664
00:34:44,172 --> 00:34:46,184
I think that rich people
should live like poor people

665
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,686
and poor people
should live like rich people

666
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,646
and it should change every week.

667
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,848
It's prison that changed Tupac.

668
00:34:58,253 --> 00:35:00,189
Going to jail
over all that stuff,

669
00:35:00,221 --> 00:35:03,158
it made him bitter,
and they changed him,

670
00:35:03,192 --> 00:35:05,126
made him hateful.

671
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,962
He wasn't hateful before.

672
00:35:06,996 --> 00:35:10,900
But that made him
very hateful and paranoid.

673
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:13,235
Tupac blamed Biggie
for not coming forward

674
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:15,371
to help him at this time.

675
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,806
Biggie knew the gangsters

676
00:35:16,838 --> 00:35:18,974
that had shot him
at the Quad Studios

677
00:35:19,007 --> 00:35:21,309
and were behind
the sexual abuse charges

678
00:35:21,342 --> 00:35:24,245
that landed Tupac in prison.

679
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:26,748
I would say...

680
00:35:26,782 --> 00:35:29,117
Big had love for Pac.

681
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:32,721
And it's not that
he wanted to snake him,

682
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,924
but self-preservation.

683
00:35:34,956 --> 00:35:36,267
You know, you don't
wanna get entangled

684
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:41,030
with people who can hurt you.

685
00:35:41,063 --> 00:35:42,632
You know, but at the same time,

686
00:35:42,665 --> 00:35:44,833
you know something's gonna
happen to your friend.

687
00:35:44,866 --> 00:35:49,070
You try to warn him
in a way that was covert

688
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:51,773
but you didn't wanna
just blatantly say,

689
00:35:51,806 --> 00:35:54,676
you know, "These guys,
they stick up kids,

690
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,646
they're extortionists.

691
00:35:56,679 --> 00:35:58,247
You know, they're gonna
come for you."

692
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:05,253
The whole time he was in jail,
he was trying to figure out

693
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:07,857
how he was gonna get revenge.

694
00:36:07,889 --> 00:36:11,126
He started to plot on
how he was gonna get back at

695
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,295
everybody who wronged him.

696
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:44,026
I bet you that music hurt,
hurt him a little bit inside.

697
00:36:46,027 --> 00:36:49,264
I don't have a fact, I don't
have anything to back that up.

698
00:36:49,297 --> 00:36:53,735
But that ain't who he was.

699
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:56,805
All Eyez On Me and um,

700
00:36:56,838 --> 00:37:00,208
the Killuminati Theory
or whatever it was called...

701
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:01,710
I forgot the name
of the last album.

702
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:04,346
I loved it, but, um,

703
00:37:04,378 --> 00:37:06,315
those albums weren't him.

704
00:37:06,348 --> 00:37:08,784
That ain't the seven...
that 17-year-old

705
00:37:08,817 --> 00:37:11,020
would've never said
any of that stuff.

706
00:37:11,052 --> 00:37:13,723
You know, I mean, he...
back when he started,

707
00:37:13,755 --> 00:37:15,991
I mean, he was...
he would never be like that,

708
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:17,425
but we all changed.

709
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:19,503
He got his edge, he knew
what he had to sell records.

710
00:37:19,527 --> 00:37:22,831
He was like,
"This is what I gotta do.

711
00:37:22,864 --> 00:37:25,166
I'll hold Suge three albums
or four albums

712
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:27,469
or whatever many albums,
I gotta do this

713
00:37:27,503 --> 00:37:29,305
and these albums gotta sell."

714
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:34,076
When he first started, he was
talking about Panther Power.

715
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:36,145
Black issues, Black rights.

716
00:38:03,172 --> 00:38:08,077
When Tupac was around us,
he was really nice.

717
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,846
He was, he was another one
that was a genius.

718
00:38:10,878 --> 00:38:15,351
Tupac was a reader
but when he got around Suge,

719
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:17,786
it was a whole different person.

720
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,824
He kinda got gangster.

721
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:25,895
You know, like,
his personality changed

722
00:38:25,927 --> 00:38:29,130
I guess to just show Suge,
you know, "I'm all that."

723
00:38:29,163 --> 00:38:30,498
You know?

724
00:38:30,532 --> 00:38:31,867
Come on, man!

725
00:38:55,858 --> 00:38:57,426
I remember he came up
with the plot

726
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,596
that he was going to sleep
with Faith Evans

727
00:39:00,628 --> 00:39:03,364
in jail.

728
00:39:03,398 --> 00:39:06,068
You know, and at first
when he told me it, I'm like...

729
00:39:08,469 --> 00:39:11,840
Then I was just like,
you can't tell Pac nothing.

730
00:39:11,873 --> 00:39:14,275
Whatever he said he's gonna do,
he's gonna do it.

731
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:19,013
So, it's like, get on board
with it, or get out the way.

732
00:39:19,047 --> 00:39:21,050
Yeah, he called me up
and he's like, "Guess what?"

733
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:23,117
He was like, "I did it,"
and I'm like,

734
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,887
I'm like,
"What, what did you do?"

735
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,290
And he was like,
"Oh, I fucked Faith."

736
00:39:28,322 --> 00:39:30,300
He was like, "Not only
did I fuck her," he was like,

737
00:39:30,324 --> 00:39:33,261
"but I got her to come in the
studio and do a song with me."

738
00:39:33,295 --> 00:39:36,264
And I was like, "Really?"

739
00:39:36,297 --> 00:39:39,234
Today, however,
through the lyrics of rappers

740
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:41,237
who display no respect
for women...

741
00:39:50,478 --> 00:39:54,616
It is obscene, it is obscene,
it is obscene.

742
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:06,896
And now we got the East Coast,
West Coast shit.

743
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:09,632
We got bad a motherfucker
on the East Coast.

744
00:40:09,665 --> 00:40:11,900
Puffy, bad boy.

745
00:40:11,933 --> 00:40:13,434
We got Suge.

746
00:40:13,467 --> 00:40:15,303
And here we about to
come into this.

747
00:40:15,337 --> 00:40:17,639
East Coast, West Coast nonsense,

748
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:20,441
with two motherfucking
casts of characters

749
00:40:20,474 --> 00:40:22,076
that the press loved.

750
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,646
You remember that shit.

751
00:40:27,416 --> 00:40:29,451
It just took a life
all on its own.

752
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:38,960
Anyone who's out there,

753
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:42,063
wanna be a artist
and wanna stay a star,

754
00:40:42,096 --> 00:40:43,173
don't wanna... they won't
have to worry about

755
00:40:43,197 --> 00:40:47,402
the executive producer
trying to be all in the videos,

756
00:40:47,436 --> 00:40:50,372
all on the records, dancing.

757
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:51,940
Come to Death Row.

758
00:40:55,009 --> 00:40:57,212
If he'd have stood the course
on saying, you know,

759
00:40:57,244 --> 00:41:00,382
"You don't want the person
being all in your videos,"

760
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:01,626
and did a...
if he'd have stood on that

761
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:06,355
and not try to get in videos
and put his ass on magazines...

762
00:41:06,387 --> 00:41:09,023
He tried to become the star.

763
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:10,959
Going towards the end,
he was on all magazines

764
00:41:10,992 --> 00:41:12,594
with cigars in his mouth.

765
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:16,065
He forgot what he said,

766
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,433
and that's what
brought him down.

767
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:20,569
You gotta take care
of the artist.

768
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,074
Biggie Smalls took Puffy's side
on the East Coast.

769
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,143
So y'all, Brooklyn in the house.

770
00:41:28,175 --> 00:41:29,744
Representing!

771
00:41:29,777 --> 00:41:33,181
Snoop, Tupac, and Dr. Dre
supported Suge Knight

772
00:41:33,215 --> 00:41:35,550
on the West Coast
at Death Row Records.

773
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:37,618
The East Coast ain't got no love
for Dr. Dre

774
00:41:37,652 --> 00:41:40,422
and Snoop Dog and Death Row?

775
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:42,590
Y'all don't love us?

776
00:41:42,623 --> 00:41:45,159
Y'all don't love us?

777
00:41:45,192 --> 00:41:46,060
Well, let it be known then...

778
00:41:46,094 --> 00:41:47,628
Suge definitely
couldn't back down.

779
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:51,000
Suge had more to lose
if he showed a sign of weakness

780
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:54,369
because of these guys he had.

781
00:41:56,505 --> 00:41:58,674
If you turn in...
if you a gorilla

782
00:41:58,706 --> 00:42:01,275
and turn into a monkey,
you got a problem.

783
00:42:01,308 --> 00:42:04,078
You don't belong in this crowd.

784
00:42:04,112 --> 00:42:07,782
If you a motherfucking pit bull
and turn into a poodle,

785
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:09,317
you don't belong in this crowd.

786
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:11,020
They gonna eat your ass up.

787
00:42:11,052 --> 00:42:13,422
So, he had to keep it up there.

788
00:42:13,454 --> 00:42:14,564
He had to keep his chest up.

789
00:42:14,588 --> 00:42:17,759
He had to...
he had to be Suge Knight.

790
00:42:17,793 --> 00:42:20,362
And he did that well.

791
00:42:20,395 --> 00:42:22,563
Tupac and Biggie shit just threw

792
00:42:22,596 --> 00:42:26,768
a motherfucking atomic bomb
on the gasoline,

793
00:42:26,802 --> 00:42:29,438
and it just exploded.

794
00:42:29,471 --> 00:42:31,706
Boom, and people
was taking sides

795
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:35,076
and you have
now magazines like...

796
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,814
whole messy ass vibe
and a lot of them magazines,

797
00:42:38,846 --> 00:42:41,082
you know, East Coast,
West Coast,

798
00:42:41,116 --> 00:42:42,483
this, that, whoo.

799
00:42:42,516 --> 00:42:47,255
East Coast, West Coast,
that, dot, aah, wham, bam.

800
00:42:47,288 --> 00:42:49,190
All that nonsense.

801
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:54,163
Tupac got swallowed up
by Death Row.

802
00:42:54,195 --> 00:42:57,599
He got swallowed up
by his surroundings.

803
00:43:35,536 --> 00:43:37,605
Tupac was already crazy.

804
00:43:37,639 --> 00:43:38,707
It just, it just,

805
00:43:38,739 --> 00:43:41,275
it just turned him up
another notch.

806
00:43:41,308 --> 00:43:43,478
You know, 'cause, it was already
going down over...

807
00:43:43,512 --> 00:43:46,381
he came to a company where
it was already going down.

808
00:43:46,413 --> 00:43:48,583
So, when he came over,
he looked like,

809
00:43:48,616 --> 00:43:51,119
"Wow, yeah, I'm finna turn
the fuck up."

810
00:43:51,152 --> 00:43:53,121
He said,
"I got these fools with me?

811
00:43:53,154 --> 00:43:54,288
They finna ride?

812
00:43:54,322 --> 00:43:56,258
Oh yeah, we going to go...

813
00:43:56,291 --> 00:43:58,460
everything to get in my way,
I'ma knock it down.

814
00:43:58,492 --> 00:43:59,695
I'm going crazy."

815
00:43:59,728 --> 00:44:01,363
'Cause he was already amped up.

816
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:02,296
You know what I'm saying?

817
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:05,634
So, he landed right
where he wanted to land.

818
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:08,904
And he already had a attitude
because they didn't go get him...

819
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:10,771
other people
didn't go get him out,

820
00:44:10,804 --> 00:44:12,373
you know,
when he caught the case.

821
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:14,510
Suge Knight went
and got him out.

822
00:44:14,543 --> 00:44:18,579
So, when he came out, you know,
people gonna be fully loyal.

823
00:44:18,612 --> 00:44:20,691
All right, still hanging out
at the after party and, uh,

824
00:44:20,715 --> 00:44:24,253
with me, uh, from uh Death Row,
introduce yourself, my man.

825
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,922
Hey there,
I'm Suge Knight and...

826
00:44:26,954 --> 00:44:28,590
Tupac Shakur.

827
00:44:28,623 --> 00:44:30,291
- Do you believe in God?
- Certainly.

828
00:44:30,324 --> 00:44:32,160
Believe in Death Row East.

829
00:44:32,194 --> 00:44:33,938
- Believe in that, for real.
- You my homeboy say,

830
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,505
- I'ma ride with you to...
- That's it right there.

831
00:44:35,529 --> 00:44:37,598
When you believe in God,
believe in Death Row East.

832
00:44:37,632 --> 00:44:40,434
I think Pac really appreciated
that Suge

833
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:42,236
was looking out for him
the way that he was,

834
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:44,172
'cause nobody else did it.

835
00:44:44,206 --> 00:44:46,808
Eating, traveling, girls.

836
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,810
Whatever they did,
they did it together.

837
00:44:49,844 --> 00:44:51,380
To me it was just
an incredible life,

838
00:44:51,413 --> 00:44:52,590
I mean, you know,
it was Death Row.

839
00:44:52,614 --> 00:44:55,184
We were the Motown of the '90s.

840
00:44:55,217 --> 00:44:58,353
The Motown of the '90s,
we had the hottest rappers.

841
00:44:58,386 --> 00:45:01,255
Suge was like the mayor of LA.

842
00:45:01,288 --> 00:45:03,524
I mean, you know,
and if he said it, it went.

843
00:45:03,558 --> 00:45:06,561
I mean, we shopped in the malls,
three o'clock in the morning.

844
00:45:06,594 --> 00:45:08,829
Three AM in the morning,
four o'clock in the morning.

845
00:45:08,862 --> 00:45:10,831
You know, four, five stores
is staying open

846
00:45:10,864 --> 00:45:12,767
because Suge Knight called them
early in the day

847
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,204
and made an appointment for them
to be open at three AM.

848
00:45:16,237 --> 00:45:17,514
And we just go into
this Footlocker

849
00:45:17,538 --> 00:45:19,741
and get as many shoes
and clothes that we want

850
00:45:19,773 --> 00:45:22,243
or, you know,
going some of the boutiques

851
00:45:22,277 --> 00:45:23,779
and shop at three
in the morning.

852
00:45:23,811 --> 00:45:25,746
Those fringe benefits
were incredible.

853
00:45:25,779 --> 00:45:29,217
To be 15 years old,
coming from where I come from

854
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,619
and, you know,
eating in the finest places,

855
00:45:31,652 --> 00:45:34,589
always flying on airplanes
and private jets

856
00:45:34,623 --> 00:45:36,657
and on his yachts
and things like that.

857
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:37,690
That was incredible.

858
00:45:41,663 --> 00:45:44,299
That's what Death Row was about.

859
00:45:44,331 --> 00:45:46,400
We caught things on records that
nobody else...

860
00:45:46,433 --> 00:45:48,302
you hear them footsteps
in records.

861
00:45:48,335 --> 00:45:49,804
And those doors slamming, boom,

862
00:45:49,837 --> 00:45:52,307
"Welcome to Death Row,"
that was organic.

863
00:46:16,864 --> 00:46:18,599
That's why he's the daddy
of rappers

864
00:46:18,632 --> 00:46:21,236
because those things
were organic.

865
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,783
He's living the life.

866
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:37,853
The money's there.

867
00:46:37,886 --> 00:46:40,855
They've got the girls around.

868
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:44,526
They're living the video life.

869
00:46:44,558 --> 00:46:45,493
Whatever it is.

870
00:46:45,527 --> 00:46:48,362
It's, um, cool location.

871
00:46:48,395 --> 00:46:50,865
They've got the cars,
they got the big houses.

872
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,835
Pam had introduced me
to some of the girls

873
00:46:54,869 --> 00:46:56,872
who dated Suge and Tupac.

874
00:46:56,904 --> 00:47:00,474
And I wondered if she recognizes
any of them from these pictures.

875
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:03,009
Let me see.

876
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:10,552
I seen her somewhere
before though.

877
00:47:10,585 --> 00:47:13,021
I don't know where
I seen her at,

878
00:47:13,054 --> 00:47:17,092
but she looks so familiar.

879
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:20,395
They look like
they're very young.

880
00:47:20,427 --> 00:47:21,596
Looking for love.

881
00:47:21,628 --> 00:47:23,474
When you're looking for love
and looking for somebody

882
00:47:23,498 --> 00:47:26,501
to care about you,
this is what happens.

883
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:29,471
- Looking for love?
- Looking for love.

884
00:47:29,503 --> 00:47:31,473
Looking for love.

885
00:47:31,505 --> 00:47:35,109
You only do demoralizing shit
and, um...

886
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,079
You only let a motherfucker
treat you like this

887
00:47:37,112 --> 00:47:39,047
if you don't have nothing.

888
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:40,614
You know what I'm saying?

889
00:47:40,648 --> 00:47:43,352
And they bait you in.

890
00:47:43,384 --> 00:47:46,053
And Tupac, but he just
was a follower.

891
00:47:46,087 --> 00:47:47,789
Suge Knight had
his head blew up,

892
00:47:47,822 --> 00:47:50,992
had his head so blue
to where he lost his life.

893
00:47:51,025 --> 00:47:53,695
He's at the prime of his life,

894
00:47:53,728 --> 00:47:56,932
but he's being directed
by a fucking asshole.

895
00:47:56,965 --> 00:47:59,468
And a deal,
he don't even see it coming,

896
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,371
but he's so low,
and he's looking for love, too.

897
00:48:03,404 --> 00:48:05,483
This is the one I seen before.

898
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,708
Hi, mom!

899
00:48:06,741 --> 00:48:08,476
Goddamn.

900
00:48:08,509 --> 00:48:11,812
- Hey!
- Hi, mom.

901
00:48:11,846 --> 00:48:15,449
- Hi, Nick.
- Hi, Symphony.

902
00:48:15,483 --> 00:48:16,718
Hey!

903
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,827
I gotta go get the computer.

904
00:48:17,851 --> 00:48:20,554
Go say hi to my Auntie Anne.

905
00:48:20,587 --> 00:48:21,922
Backpack for you.

906
00:48:21,956 --> 00:48:23,925
Say hi to Nick and them.

907
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:25,694
Remember Nick and Barney?

908
00:48:25,726 --> 00:48:27,695
- Hi!
- My Auntie Anne.

909
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:36,771
Tupac was so influenced by Suge,

910
00:48:36,804 --> 00:48:40,074
that he joined the Mob Pirus,
Suge's Compton gang,

911
00:48:40,108 --> 00:48:42,544
also known as the Bloods.

912
00:48:42,576 --> 00:48:44,745
He would become so gang obsessed

913
00:48:44,779 --> 00:48:47,482
that he would ultimately
lose his life to it.

914
00:48:47,514 --> 00:48:50,585
I remember the first night
when he turned MOB.

915
00:48:50,617 --> 00:48:52,853
We was on one side of the studio

916
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:56,925
and one of my little homeboys,
Tycas, rest in peace,

917
00:48:56,958 --> 00:48:58,601
he went around there
and looked in the studio

918
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:00,561
where Dre and Pac
and all of them was at.

919
00:49:00,594 --> 00:49:03,063
And he ran back around there
to us and said, he said,

920
00:49:03,096 --> 00:49:05,099
"Cuz," I said,
"What's happening?"

921
00:49:05,132 --> 00:49:09,437
He said, "Man, Pac over there
in all red."

922
00:49:09,471 --> 00:49:11,540
We went over there and looked.

923
00:49:11,572 --> 00:49:13,040
I said, "Well, they got him."

924
00:49:13,074 --> 00:49:15,777
And we went back over there
to our side.

925
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:18,112
That night we went over there
and looked and went in there

926
00:49:18,145 --> 00:49:21,649
and seen him in all that red,
that night he turned MOB.

927
00:49:23,717 --> 00:49:26,187
Before that he was hanging
with us all the time,

928
00:49:26,221 --> 00:49:29,590
on the Crips side.

929
00:49:29,623 --> 00:49:33,093
He was a very kindhearted person

930
00:49:33,126 --> 00:49:36,096
who got lost in the image
of being tough.

931
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,866
He just wasn't a fighter.

932
00:49:37,898 --> 00:49:39,534
He was definitely a lover,
not a fighter.

933
00:49:39,567 --> 00:49:40,702
We used to laugh about it.

934
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:45,507
But he had suffered

935
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:47,476
some brutal beat downs out here.

936
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:49,110
He wanted to be tougher.

937
00:49:49,143 --> 00:49:50,878
After he did Juice,
he started acting like

938
00:49:50,911 --> 00:49:52,713
he was the character in Juice.

939
00:49:52,746 --> 00:49:55,250
His persona changed.

940
00:49:55,282 --> 00:49:58,085
And he... you know,
a lot of my childhood friends

941
00:49:58,119 --> 00:49:59,521
from Marin 'cause I introduced
him

942
00:49:59,554 --> 00:50:01,556
to most of my friends
and family.

943
00:50:01,588 --> 00:50:04,492
They said he started acting
like he was Bishop.

944
00:50:04,525 --> 00:50:06,627
I ain't gots to do nothing.

945
00:50:06,661 --> 00:50:08,663
You the past, bro.

946
00:50:08,695 --> 00:50:11,900
My time is now.

947
00:50:11,933 --> 00:50:12,934
Ready to die, n♪♪♪♪?

948
00:50:14,701 --> 00:50:17,738
When they expected him
to be this thug, this gangster,

949
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:20,808
which he wasn't,
it got him killed.

950
00:50:20,842 --> 00:50:24,546
It's a hard thing to be
a gun toting person

951
00:50:24,579 --> 00:50:26,615
with all that malice
in your heart.

952
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:29,284
It's a burden.

953
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,219
Tupac Shakur.

954
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:33,922
You know, when I,
when I first met Tupac,

955
00:50:33,954 --> 00:50:37,625
Suge brought him to the hood
when he came home.

956
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,561
Tupac was real cool.

957
00:50:39,594 --> 00:50:41,096
He was real cool.

958
00:50:41,128 --> 00:50:45,599
And, the next time you see him,

959
00:50:45,632 --> 00:50:49,203
he owned the thug shit
like Suge.

960
00:50:49,237 --> 00:50:52,040
He know he can't be touched
at this time.

961
00:50:52,072 --> 00:50:55,576
I got 10, 11 motherfuckers
who gonna be around me

962
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,245
all day, every day.

963
00:50:57,277 --> 00:50:59,880
And they ready to kill
a motherfucker for me.

964
00:50:59,913 --> 00:51:03,918
So, right here, telling me,
I can do what I wanna do.

965
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:06,253
I can cuss out any motherfucker
I wanna cuss out.

966
00:51:06,286 --> 00:51:08,756
I can spit on whoever
I wanna spit on.

967
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:10,891
And ain't nothing gonna happen.

968
00:51:10,925 --> 00:51:14,129
There's no such word
of repercussion here.

969
00:51:14,161 --> 00:51:17,933
When he put the Mob on him,
I definitely didn't like that.

970
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:21,001
Because me and my brother

971
00:51:21,034 --> 00:51:25,172
used to have the biggest
arguments in the world.

972
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,248
Buntry, Mob James' brother,

973
00:51:34,282 --> 00:51:36,251
seen here in hat and red,

974
00:51:36,284 --> 00:51:39,054
became Suge and Tupac's
number one man,

975
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:41,222
which caused problems
between the brothers.

976
00:51:41,255 --> 00:51:42,958
My brother and them can say...

977
00:51:42,991 --> 00:51:44,893
N♪♪♪♪ can claim the Mob
if you want to.

978
00:51:44,925 --> 00:51:46,761
No, you can't.

979
00:51:46,793 --> 00:51:50,030
You ain't did no drive-by
shoots, you ain't did no...

980
00:51:50,063 --> 00:51:52,199
you ain't beat
no motherfucking body up.

981
00:51:52,233 --> 00:51:54,636
You ain't, you ain't did shit.

982
00:51:54,668 --> 00:51:57,806
What it it takes
to be what we are.

983
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:00,842
So, that's just like me just...

984
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:03,078
Tupac the homie
'cause Tupac got money.

985
00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:04,011
No, fuck that.

986
00:52:04,045 --> 00:52:08,882
This means a lot more
to me than Tupac.

987
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:11,920
You going over there
and be Death Row Mob.

988
00:52:11,953 --> 00:52:14,655
But not this, not from here.

989
00:52:14,688 --> 00:52:16,824
You ain't from Compton.

990
00:52:16,858 --> 00:52:18,226
I'd let my sister sing that song

991
00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:20,628
but she just ain't that good,
so...

992
00:52:23,331 --> 00:52:28,069
Anyway, I want everybody
give a big welcome for...

993
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:29,170
Tupac.

994
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,376
They were like brothers.

995
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:38,413
Tupac is, is like
a little brother to him.

996
00:52:38,445 --> 00:52:40,014
They had keys
to each other's house.

997
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:42,282
They think with one brain.

998
00:52:42,315 --> 00:52:45,386
Tupac never had a foundation.

999
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:49,124
Never had a foundation,
he never had like that family...

1000
00:52:49,157 --> 00:52:50,859
you know like, that stability.

1001
00:52:50,891 --> 00:52:52,326
Uncle Suge did.

1002
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:55,864
So I think that's why they kind
of fed off each other.

1003
00:52:55,896 --> 00:52:59,099
Um, Uncle Suge
was thinking more so of

1004
00:52:59,132 --> 00:53:01,035
just getting money,
and making money

1005
00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:02,771
and uh, you know,
supporting the...

1006
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,806
you know, I guess Black people
as a whole.

1007
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:07,808
And Tupac was more so,
"No, think bigger, think bigger.

1008
00:53:07,842 --> 00:53:09,110
We can go international.

1009
00:53:09,143 --> 00:53:11,179
We can do this,
we can, we can do that."

1010
00:53:11,212 --> 00:53:16,184
Hence the Death Row East
and et cetera, et cetera.

1011
00:53:16,217 --> 00:53:19,753
I mean, he was like, "I want
our faces printed on money.

1012
00:53:19,786 --> 00:53:20,754
I want, I want something bigger,

1013
00:53:20,788 --> 00:53:22,690
let's think bigger,
let's think bigger."

1014
00:53:22,724 --> 00:53:24,693
And Tupac more
was on the bigger side.

1015
00:53:24,726 --> 00:53:26,003
Let's think bigger,
and Uncle Suge was like,

1016
00:53:26,027 --> 00:53:28,063
"Huh, okay."

1017
00:53:30,898 --> 00:53:33,867
That's Tupac and Uncle Suge
and they share everything.

1018
00:53:35,936 --> 00:53:38,706
Yes, they shared everything.

1019
00:53:43,844 --> 00:53:48,049
Things were totally
out of control.

1020
00:53:48,081 --> 00:53:51,920
And it's very sad.

1021
00:53:51,953 --> 00:53:55,790
I always had that dark sense
and, um,

1022
00:53:55,822 --> 00:53:57,357
I always seemed to be the one

1023
00:53:57,391 --> 00:54:00,395
to uh, kill the joy.

1024
00:54:03,029 --> 00:54:06,467
Everybody wanted to be happy

1025
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,902
and high and drinking,

1026
00:54:08,936 --> 00:54:11,338
and I felt like they smoked
too much weed.

1027
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,243
You know,
the whole atmosphere

1028
00:54:16,277 --> 00:54:21,282
was one of total disconnect
to reality.

1029
00:54:21,315 --> 00:54:25,019
But it was way beyond

1030
00:54:25,052 --> 00:54:28,757
what he needed to deal
with the realities

1031
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:31,826
of his life at that time.

1032
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:33,962
He had too much going on
that required

1033
00:54:33,994 --> 00:54:36,764
a lot of logical,
level-headed thinking,

1034
00:54:36,797 --> 00:54:39,333
and he wasn't getting that.

1035
00:54:39,366 --> 00:54:41,435
I was trying to give it to him,

1036
00:54:41,469 --> 00:54:45,106
but he wasn't listening to me.

1037
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:47,876
I didn't know who to trust,

1038
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:51,279
and I didn't trust Death Row.

1039
00:54:51,311 --> 00:54:54,549
They have a "get rich
or die ethos," the West Coast.

1040
00:54:54,581 --> 00:54:58,051
Doesn't matter what you do
as long as you makin' money.

1041
00:54:58,085 --> 00:55:00,320
Death Row made millions, yeah.

1042
00:55:00,353 --> 00:55:04,224
But Tupac didn't see that money.

1043
00:55:04,257 --> 00:55:07,261
First thing I noticed
was that David Kenner,

1044
00:55:07,295 --> 00:55:11,532
who was the lawyer
for Death Row Records.

1045
00:55:13,433 --> 00:55:16,870
And I said to him,
"Tupac, that's a contradiction.

1046
00:55:16,904 --> 00:55:19,407
You need your own lawyer."

1047
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,943
Tupac did not fire David Kenner

1048
00:55:21,976 --> 00:55:24,244
until, I believe, August.

1049
00:55:24,277 --> 00:55:26,547
So we went all those months

1050
00:55:26,581 --> 00:55:30,117
with his business up in the air,

1051
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:32,520
no accountability
about his money,

1052
00:55:32,552 --> 00:55:34,888
no accountability about
what was being spent,

1053
00:55:34,922 --> 00:55:36,925
what was being recouped.

1054
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,860
So that's why
we were always asking,

1055
00:55:38,893 --> 00:55:42,864
"Well, what is... how much money
does he actually have?"

1056
00:55:42,896 --> 00:55:45,833
Well, every time
we would ask for the audit,

1057
00:55:45,866 --> 00:55:49,369
there'd be a new gift.

1058
00:55:49,402 --> 00:55:52,873
There'd be a new car.

1059
00:55:52,907 --> 00:55:56,344
There'd be a gift to the family.

1060
00:55:56,376 --> 00:55:59,913
And these cars
weren't even in his name.

1061
00:55:59,947 --> 00:56:01,516
When Tupac passed away,

1062
00:56:01,549 --> 00:56:03,418
that's the first thing
Death Row did was come

1063
00:56:03,451 --> 00:56:06,286
and take the cars back.

1064
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,356
He didn't want to hear me
telling him that,

1065
00:56:08,389 --> 00:56:10,592
"Tupac, they're sending
over roses.

1066
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:12,460
They're sending over cars.

1067
00:56:12,492 --> 00:56:14,295
They're sending over gifts."

1068
00:56:14,328 --> 00:56:17,264
I said, "Don't you think there's
somethin' wrong with that?"

1069
00:56:17,297 --> 00:56:21,301
And he would go all the way
live off on me and say,

1070
00:56:21,335 --> 00:56:26,107
and basically say,
"I know it's a problem, okay?

1071
00:56:26,139 --> 00:56:28,643
But I know what I'm doing,
yes."

1072
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:30,311
And it caused conflict.

1073
00:56:30,344 --> 00:56:34,449
It caused conflict with...
between me and him.

1074
00:56:34,482 --> 00:56:38,418
It was a living nightmare.

1075
00:56:54,367 --> 00:56:57,005
Everybody just got
too comfortable

1076
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,473
and it went the way it went

1077
00:56:58,505 --> 00:57:03,344
because nobody was in
Tupac's ear, "No, homie.

1078
00:57:03,376 --> 00:57:05,545
You... we gotta protect you.

1079
00:57:05,579 --> 00:57:07,615
We gotta be like this."

1080
00:57:13,219 --> 00:57:15,122
They say he just put
the icing on the cake

1081
00:57:15,155 --> 00:57:17,025
because now there's more fun,

1082
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:21,161
now there's more Tupac
tryin' be like, you know,

1083
00:57:21,195 --> 00:57:24,265
like the security
opposed to being a rapper,

1084
00:57:24,297 --> 00:57:26,300
and he's not on
the Snoop Dogg tip,

1085
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:28,402
he's on the homies tip.

1086
00:57:28,436 --> 00:57:31,973
And now there's drinking
and getting high all day

1087
00:57:32,005 --> 00:57:34,675
and wanting to beat up somebody.

1088
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:36,610
You know,
just the whole mentality.

1089
00:57:36,643 --> 00:57:38,679
Every... they just changed.

1090
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:47,021
I stopped Tupac
from fighting many times.

1091
00:57:47,054 --> 00:57:51,425
Tupac was a disturbed soul
when it came to gangbanging

1092
00:57:51,458 --> 00:57:53,962
and fighting
and stuff like that.

1093
00:57:53,994 --> 00:57:55,063
He loved to fight.

1094
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,298
- He loved to fight?
- Oh, he loved to fight, yeah.

1095
00:57:57,331 --> 00:57:59,666
He loved getting
into altercations.

1096
00:57:59,699 --> 00:58:01,735
- Did he?
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1097
00:58:01,768 --> 00:58:03,971
Absolutely.

1098
00:58:04,005 --> 00:58:05,540
The night of the fatal shooting,

1099
00:58:05,572 --> 00:58:08,009
Tupac, to prove
his gang loyalty,

1100
00:58:08,041 --> 00:58:11,078
took on a Crip gunman
called Orlando Anderson.

1101
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,487
Orlando, a Crip gang member,

1102
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,155
was a long-term enemy
of the Bloods,

1103
00:58:22,188 --> 00:58:25,659
but it would turn out to be
a fatal mistake for Tupac.

1104
00:58:25,692 --> 00:58:27,761
Suge, himself,
took part in the fight,

1105
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,697
for which he would be
sent to prison.

1106
00:58:36,036 --> 00:58:38,772
Orlando boasted
that he had shot Tupac.

1107
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:42,443
Frank, Tupac's bodyguard,
was in the car behind.

1108
00:58:42,476 --> 00:58:45,512
The gun just starts firing.

1109
00:58:45,545 --> 00:58:47,523
He's obviously aware that
bullets are coming through

1110
00:58:47,547 --> 00:58:50,183
the car and he's being shot at.

1111
00:58:50,217 --> 00:58:54,655
And as he fires,
he hits Tupac a couple of times

1112
00:58:54,688 --> 00:58:57,291
and bullets are bouncing,
going all through the car.

1113
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:02,329
As I'm running up
to the car thinking,

1114
00:59:02,362 --> 00:59:04,498
"Oh my God, they're dead."

1115
00:59:04,532 --> 00:59:06,501
Suge's laying down
on the ground.

1116
00:59:14,808 --> 00:59:19,813
Tupac is still
in the passenger side.

1117
00:59:19,846 --> 00:59:22,182
At that point,
we pulled Tupac out

1118
00:59:22,215 --> 00:59:25,286
and, um, we laid him down
on the ground

1119
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:27,654
and that when the, uh,
paramedics were taking over

1120
00:59:27,688 --> 00:59:28,756
at that point right there.

1121
00:59:28,788 --> 00:59:31,158
Did Tupac say anything
at that point?

1122
00:59:31,192 --> 00:59:33,761
He just... he moved his arms
from his side

1123
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:38,098
and he crossed 'em
over his body, as such,

1124
00:59:38,132 --> 00:59:41,101
and said, "I can't breathe."

1125
00:59:41,134 --> 00:59:43,170
And that was the last thing
I ever heard him say.

1126
00:59:58,418 --> 01:00:00,754
So, we were there
the six days that...

1127
01:00:00,788 --> 01:00:02,623
six, seven days
that Pac was living.

1128
01:00:02,655 --> 01:00:06,828
We would go in the room
and, um, you know, pray.

1129
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,563
You know, pray for him
to get better,

1130
01:00:08,596 --> 01:00:09,764
and yeah, I sang for him.

1131
01:00:09,797 --> 01:00:10,874
I always sang for him, though.

1132
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:15,536
I always sang for him,
but being able to sing for him,

1133
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:18,639
in the hospital
while he was laying how he was

1134
01:00:18,672 --> 01:00:20,641
was something.

1135
01:00:20,674 --> 01:00:21,474
I sang Change is Gonna Come,

1136
01:00:21,507 --> 01:00:23,578
that was one
of his favorite songs

1137
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,379
that he liked me to do.

1138
01:00:26,413 --> 01:00:28,382
What, remind me of that song?

1139
01:00:28,415 --> 01:00:30,351
So that's by Sam Cooke.

1140
01:00:30,384 --> 01:00:32,420
Wanna hear it?

1141
01:01:19,567 --> 01:01:22,402
Greg Kading,
in his book, Murder Rap,

1142
01:01:22,436 --> 01:01:24,539
alleges the shooting of Tupac

1143
01:01:24,572 --> 01:01:28,409
coincided with Keefe D,
Orlando Anderson's uncle,

1144
01:01:28,442 --> 01:01:30,645
and the Crips being offered
a million dollars

1145
01:01:30,677 --> 01:01:33,346
by Puffy for protection.

1146
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,550
He claims that Puffy was saying,

1147
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:38,319
"Listen, I need you to do
something about this conflict

1148
01:01:38,351 --> 01:01:41,489
I'm having with Suge Knight
and Tupac,

1149
01:01:41,521 --> 01:01:44,625
and you know, just I'm tired
of having to look

1150
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:46,694
over my shoulders," essentially.

1151
01:01:46,726 --> 01:01:47,828
"Can you handle it?"

1152
01:01:47,862 --> 01:01:51,299
And, of course, Keefe D said,
"That's no problem.

1153
01:01:51,331 --> 01:01:53,366
You know, that's what we do."

1154
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,904
And, Keefe D said,
"We wanted a million dollars."

1155
01:01:56,936 --> 01:01:59,440
And Puffy, essentially,
is like, "Just, whatever.

1156
01:01:59,473 --> 01:02:01,509
Just handle it."

1157
01:02:01,541 --> 01:02:04,679
It was this war the Suge Knight
had with Puffy Combs

1158
01:02:04,712 --> 01:02:07,614
that cost so many lives.

1159
01:02:07,648 --> 01:02:09,650
After Orlando shot Tupac,

1160
01:02:09,683 --> 01:02:12,219
he went back to Compton
bragging about it.

1161
01:02:12,253 --> 01:02:13,287
You know what I'm saying?

1162
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,289
So we know who killed Tupac.

1163
01:02:15,322 --> 01:02:16,624
For sure, for sure.

1164
01:02:18,826 --> 01:02:21,628
And it was just a sad thing.

1165
01:02:21,661 --> 01:02:22,996
You know what I'm sayin'?

1166
01:02:23,029 --> 01:02:27,334
That these two guys
brung gangs into,

1167
01:02:27,367 --> 01:02:29,837
you know, the Hollywood world,

1168
01:02:29,869 --> 01:02:31,538
the music industry.

1169
01:02:31,572 --> 01:02:32,506
You know what I'm sayin'?

1170
01:02:32,538 --> 01:02:36,243
So it destroyed everything.

1171
01:02:44,451 --> 01:02:47,655
After Tupac's death,
a major gang war breaks out

1172
01:02:47,688 --> 01:02:51,259
between the Bloods
and the Crips.

1173
01:03:15,482 --> 01:03:18,552
Orlando Anderson is arrested
in the police raids,

1174
01:03:18,585 --> 01:03:21,789
but he's never charged because
of insufficient evidence.

1175
01:03:26,492 --> 01:03:28,996
Tupac didn't know
what he was getting into.

1176
01:03:29,029 --> 01:03:30,630
He didn't know
that the Crips and Bloods

1177
01:03:30,663 --> 01:03:33,500
been killin' each other
since the '70s.

1178
01:03:33,534 --> 01:03:35,469
And he was a shooter too.

1179
01:03:35,501 --> 01:03:37,570
See that's,
see that's the thing.

1180
01:03:37,603 --> 01:03:40,040
When you out here, you don't
know who you messin' with.

1181
01:03:40,074 --> 01:03:43,444
If you messin' with a shooter,

1182
01:03:43,476 --> 01:03:45,512
you gonna get shot.

1183
01:03:45,545 --> 01:03:47,380
If you messin' with
some fighters,

1184
01:03:47,413 --> 01:03:51,618
y'all might get down,
but it's gonna happen.

1185
01:03:51,652 --> 01:03:53,020
That's the thing about it.

1186
01:03:53,052 --> 01:03:57,023
He's gonna come back
and that's how Orlando was.

1187
01:03:57,056 --> 01:03:59,092
He wasn't going for that.

1188
01:03:59,125 --> 01:04:01,361
Yeah, we had to wear
bulletproof vests,

1189
01:04:01,395 --> 01:04:02,862
especially going toward the end.

1190
01:04:02,895 --> 01:04:06,599
I had to have security sleep
in my room, in my hotel.

1191
01:04:06,632 --> 01:04:08,069
I had to stay in a hotel
for a while

1192
01:04:08,101 --> 01:04:11,605
and security slept in my room

1193
01:04:11,637 --> 01:04:13,440
and I couldn't move without 'em.

1194
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:14,475
Why was that?

1195
01:04:14,509 --> 01:04:17,011
I mean, all the death threats
that was coming.

1196
01:04:17,043 --> 01:04:19,413
A lot of people lost their lives
when Pac died.

1197
01:04:19,445 --> 01:04:20,480
Pac died, but it was...

1198
01:04:20,514 --> 01:04:23,084
there was a lot of people
that lost their lives.

1199
01:04:24,817 --> 01:04:27,520
It appears to be
possibly a shooting.

1200
01:04:27,554 --> 01:04:28,956
Eighteen months later,

1201
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:31,891
Orlando Anderson himself
is gunned down

1202
01:04:31,925 --> 01:04:34,362
and killed at this carwash
in Compton.

1203
01:04:34,395 --> 01:04:35,762
According to sheriff's deputies,

1204
01:04:35,795 --> 01:04:38,631
one person was struck
by gunfire in Compton.

1205
01:04:38,665 --> 01:04:40,800
Right now we have one down
outside the car,

1206
01:04:40,833 --> 01:04:42,536
one down inside the car.

1207
01:04:42,569 --> 01:04:45,639
Not surprisingly, nobody in
the community trusts the police,

1208
01:04:45,672 --> 01:04:48,876
who are feared and despised.

1209
01:04:48,909 --> 01:04:51,579
Not snitching to the police
is so basic

1210
01:04:51,612 --> 01:04:54,849
that even though he knew
the identity of Tupac's gunman,

1211
01:04:54,882 --> 01:04:56,951
Suge refused to cooperate.

1212
01:04:56,983 --> 01:05:00,554
If you knew who killed Tupac,
would you tell the police?

1213
01:05:00,587 --> 01:05:03,958
Absolutely not.

1214
01:05:03,991 --> 01:05:05,101
I mean, 'cause, you know,
I don't know...

1215
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:07,795
- Why not?
- Because it's not my job.

1216
01:05:07,828 --> 01:05:10,398
I don't get paid
to solve homicides.

1217
01:05:10,431 --> 01:05:12,900
I don't get paid
to tell on people.

1218
01:05:12,933 --> 01:05:14,869
Pam, our producer,
had to defend us

1219
01:05:14,902 --> 01:05:19,473
from being mistaken for LAPD
police officer, Greg Kading.

1220
01:05:19,505 --> 01:05:22,009
Without Pam, we could never
have made the film.

1221
01:05:26,145 --> 01:05:28,148
No, he's not.

1222
01:05:30,951 --> 01:05:33,387
No, where did you hear
that from?

1223
01:05:35,922 --> 01:05:37,424
No.

1224
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:40,493
I'm 100% sure.

1225
01:05:40,527 --> 01:05:42,896
Where did you get
that shit from?

1226
01:05:48,768 --> 01:05:50,637
Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't...

1227
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:52,172
if he was an ex-police officer,

1228
01:05:52,206 --> 01:05:54,208
you think I would help him
or fuck with him?

1229
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:57,945
He wasn't in the... listen, uh-uh.

1230
01:05:57,978 --> 01:05:59,923
Didn't I... didn't he send you
the link to everything

1231
01:05:59,947 --> 01:06:02,916
you can Google and find out
about who he is?

1232
01:06:05,018 --> 01:06:06,162
All right, I'ma send it to you.

1233
01:06:06,186 --> 01:06:08,122
I want you to check it out.

1234
01:06:08,154 --> 01:06:10,089
Now where did you... they lyin'.

1235
01:06:10,123 --> 01:06:11,659
I don't fuck with the police.

1236
01:06:11,692 --> 01:06:14,795
Yeah, yeah, I mean, and
let me just say this to you,

1237
01:06:14,828 --> 01:06:16,039
it don't even
fucking matter to me

1238
01:06:16,063 --> 01:06:18,566
because I don't fuck
with the police

1239
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:22,069
and whoever say that shit
is lyin' and the...

1240
01:06:22,101 --> 01:06:23,636
How the fuck
this n♪♪♪♪ ex-police

1241
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,206
and he's from fucking England?

1242
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:27,608
He's from the fucking UK.

1243
01:06:43,257 --> 01:06:46,626
And he started saying
stuff like,

1244
01:06:46,659 --> 01:06:52,199
"What do you do when you
ain't got real friends?

1245
01:06:52,232 --> 01:06:57,036
What do you do when the people
you love do you wrong?"

1246
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:59,807
Like, these are some of
the words that I remember.

1247
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,509
And he would talk about it
a little more

1248
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:04,511
and he would turn around
in the chair,

1249
01:07:04,545 --> 01:07:05,813
and when he turned back around,

1250
01:07:05,846 --> 01:07:09,215
like about the third time,
he's crying.

1251
01:07:09,248 --> 01:07:13,186
You know, and I knew where
that place was coming from.

1252
01:07:13,219 --> 01:07:14,254
I seen it in his face.

1253
01:07:14,288 --> 01:07:17,056
You can almost look in his eyes
and see just like...

1254
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:20,828
he's just like had this
just stare.

1255
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:24,764
Like he was so surprised that
this happened to Death Row.

1256
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:29,970
So surprised that this could
happen to somebody that he was,

1257
01:07:30,003 --> 01:07:32,206
like, the chief of watch.

1258
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:34,041
He was the overseer,

1259
01:07:34,074 --> 01:07:36,844
and that happened on his watch.

1260
01:07:36,876 --> 01:07:39,547
And he already thought
that he was untouchable.

1261
01:07:41,348 --> 01:07:44,117
And at that time,
we'd been touched.

1262
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:46,654
What happened in the end
when he got locked up,

1263
01:07:46,686 --> 01:07:49,623
Suge got a little selfish side
of him as well.

1264
01:07:49,655 --> 01:07:51,791
Mean side, mean streak.

1265
01:07:51,824 --> 01:07:54,594
So, that attitude,
I'm sure, kicked in.

1266
01:07:54,628 --> 01:07:58,065
Meaning that if I could survive
off of $5 a week,

1267
01:07:58,098 --> 01:08:02,201
if I could survive in jail
off of cookies and milk,

1268
01:08:02,235 --> 01:08:04,704
if I could survive off
of not going anywhere,

1269
01:08:04,737 --> 01:08:07,607
if I could live
in this shithole jail,

1270
01:08:07,641 --> 01:08:10,043
you should be able
to make it on the streets.

1271
01:08:10,076 --> 01:08:12,345
That's his attitude, so he
didn't even have to tell me.

1272
01:08:12,378 --> 01:08:14,915
I knew that's the kind of person
that he is.

1273
01:08:14,947 --> 01:08:16,650
"Oh, they out there
on in the streets."

1274
01:08:16,683 --> 01:08:18,293
He's not gonna pay for you
to live in Beverly Hills

1275
01:08:18,317 --> 01:08:23,089
and he's in a damn
Los Angeles County jail.

1276
01:08:23,123 --> 01:08:26,193
So, it felt like when he got
locked up, we were locked up.

1277
01:08:26,226 --> 01:08:27,861
For sure we was.

1278
01:08:27,893 --> 01:08:29,629
When Suge Knight
was sentenced to jail,

1279
01:08:29,663 --> 01:08:31,998
that's when everybody
went to jail.

1280
01:08:32,032 --> 01:08:33,667
It was a fuckin' shame, man.

1281
01:08:33,699 --> 01:08:35,168
And excuse my language,

1282
01:08:35,202 --> 01:08:40,239
but, um, you know,
at the end of this thing,

1283
01:08:40,273 --> 01:08:44,877
you know, Snoop is kinda like...

1284
01:08:44,911 --> 01:08:45,878
he's like a duck.

1285
01:08:45,912 --> 01:08:48,616
He's real cool, but underneath,

1286
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:50,951
paddling like, "Oh shit!"

1287
01:08:50,984 --> 01:08:52,219
You know?

1288
01:08:52,252 --> 01:08:54,688
"I hope I don't drown,"
you know what I mean?

1289
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,256
Same thing with the,
you know, Dogg Pound.

1290
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,891
Same thing with Nate Dogg.

1291
01:08:58,925 --> 01:09:01,261
Same thing with all the,
you know, with all the acts.

1292
01:09:01,293 --> 01:09:04,364
They all get up there
and it's like, "Wait a minute.

1293
01:09:04,398 --> 01:09:09,403
You mean there's nothing
to actually hold on to?"

1294
01:09:09,435 --> 01:09:11,037
That's kinda sad.

1295
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:13,907
That's like,
"What was you doin'?"

1296
01:09:19,813 --> 01:09:23,250
While in jail he's just,
he's just stewing

1297
01:09:23,283 --> 01:09:25,252
and he's so pissed off.

1298
01:09:25,284 --> 01:09:28,221
You know,
he just lost his friend,

1299
01:09:28,255 --> 01:09:31,091
his number one artist,
and his record company

1300
01:09:31,123 --> 01:09:34,161
is kind of beginning
to circle the drain.

1301
01:09:34,193 --> 01:09:37,997
And so he takes it upon himself
to retaliate.

1302
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:43,336
He puts things into order
to have Biggie killed.

1303
01:09:44,904 --> 01:09:48,708
Somebody had to go
after Tupac.

1304
01:09:48,742 --> 01:09:50,310
I truly believe that.

1305
01:09:50,342 --> 01:09:52,078
- So...
- Somebody had to go?

1306
01:09:52,112 --> 01:09:55,082
Yeah, somebody would've
had to die.

1307
01:09:55,114 --> 01:09:58,318
It's, it's way serious now.

1308
01:09:58,350 --> 01:10:00,153
It's way serious now.

1309
01:10:00,186 --> 01:10:02,790
Y'all done cut the head
off the chicken,

1310
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:06,894
so we gotta do
the same thing to y'all.

1311
01:10:06,926 --> 01:10:08,094
And that's all it is,

1312
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:11,965
it's repercussion, revenge.

1313
01:10:11,997 --> 01:10:13,198
Somebody gotta do something.

1314
01:10:13,233 --> 01:10:17,037
Something got to happen
because if don't nothin' happen,

1315
01:10:17,069 --> 01:10:20,174
then you'll have everybody
and their momma from everywhere

1316
01:10:20,207 --> 01:10:21,842
tryin' to get at you

1317
01:10:21,875 --> 01:10:25,378
because y'all sat back
and let Tupac get killed.

1318
01:10:25,412 --> 01:10:28,449
So, it had to be something.

1319
01:10:28,482 --> 01:10:30,384
- Sup, sup?
- How you doing?

1320
01:10:30,417 --> 01:10:34,454
Biggie shouldn't have came
to California after Tupac died.

1321
01:10:36,256 --> 01:10:39,259
That was a bad choice
for them to make.

1322
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:41,395
With the East Coast,
West Coast thing,

1323
01:10:41,427 --> 01:10:44,297
like I told... said before,
it's just a situation

1324
01:10:44,331 --> 01:10:46,400
where it was just me and Pac

1325
01:10:46,433 --> 01:10:48,502
had our little differences
or whatever.

1326
01:10:48,534 --> 01:10:50,369
But I'm here to take over.

1327
01:10:50,403 --> 01:10:51,838
Saying it's all over with.

1328
01:10:51,872 --> 01:10:53,841
I'm in the West right now.

1329
01:10:53,873 --> 01:10:55,274
If you need me, wanna see me,

1330
01:10:55,308 --> 01:10:56,976
talk to me,
whatever you wanna do.

1331
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:00,213
- Cool.
- Now the time, call on up.

1332
01:11:00,247 --> 01:11:02,182
And they all on Power 106

1333
01:11:02,215 --> 01:11:05,853
and they just all over
the radio stations

1334
01:11:05,885 --> 01:11:09,489
and, you know,
and Pac is dead now.

1335
01:11:09,523 --> 01:11:14,228
I'm like, "What the fuck
is these dudes thinkin' about?"

1336
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:20,166
And, and there's already
an undercurrent,

1337
01:11:20,199 --> 01:11:23,237
grumbling happenin' in LA.

1338
01:11:23,269 --> 01:11:25,338
Like, "These n♪♪♪♪s
got a lot of nerve.

1339
01:11:25,372 --> 01:11:27,441
They just think they gonna
just come out here?"

1340
01:11:27,474 --> 01:11:28,342
I'm serious.

1341
01:11:28,375 --> 01:11:31,011
These is now all
the gang dudes in LA.

1342
01:11:31,043 --> 01:11:33,947
And I'm talkin' about
Mexican gangs, too.

1343
01:11:33,979 --> 01:11:37,283
This had nothin' to... this wasn't
just Black gangs sayin' it.

1344
01:11:37,317 --> 01:11:39,319
"Gonna get them motherfuckers."

1345
01:11:40,386 --> 01:11:41,287
No doubt.

1346
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:42,456
- B.I.G.
- B.I.G.

1347
01:11:42,488 --> 01:11:45,024
- Hey, what's up B?
- What up, dog?

1348
01:11:45,058 --> 01:11:46,460
- Hi.
- What's up?

1349
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:59,273
Both theories about the shooting
of Biggie Smalls

1350
01:11:59,305 --> 01:12:02,408
agree that Suge Knight
ordered the hit from prison.

1351
01:12:02,442 --> 01:12:04,511
Kading argues the police
were not involved

1352
01:12:04,543 --> 01:12:07,280
and the hit was carried out
by Blood gangsters.

1353
01:12:07,314 --> 01:12:11,018
Russell Poole has always argued
that dirty cops did it.

1354
01:12:11,051 --> 01:12:14,021
You know, had it been just
your ordinary drive-by shooting

1355
01:12:14,054 --> 01:12:17,858
by some unexperienced
gangbangers,

1356
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:19,926
we would have solved it
a long time ago.

1357
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,930
No question about it,
but you gotta think to yourself,

1358
01:12:22,962 --> 01:12:26,300
"Well, who could do this
and get away with it?"

1359
01:12:26,332 --> 01:12:27,934
You gotta get into their minds.

1360
01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:29,502
Cops.

1361
01:12:33,273 --> 01:12:34,317
911 emergency,
what are you reporting?

1362
01:12:34,341 --> 01:12:37,544
Yeah, we need an ambulance
on 5th after Wilshire.

1363
01:12:37,577 --> 01:12:40,113
Please, Los Angeles,
we have a man shot.

1364
01:12:40,145 --> 01:12:41,624
- We have a man shot.
- Wilshire Boulevard.

1365
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:42,616
Okay, hold on while I get that...

1366
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,326
Right on the corner of Wilshire
and 5th Avenue.

1367
01:12:44,350 --> 01:12:45,885
Wilshire Boulevard.

1368
01:12:45,918 --> 01:12:48,287
We've a man shot
in our car right now.

1369
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,288
We're in the car right now.

1370
01:12:49,322 --> 01:12:50,433
We're rollin' to the hospital
right now.

1371
01:12:50,457 --> 01:12:53,193
I don't know, I'm not from here,
I'm from New York.

1372
01:12:53,225 --> 01:12:55,127
Is the party that was shot
in your car?

1373
01:12:55,161 --> 01:12:56,395
- No.
- I thought you said

1374
01:12:56,429 --> 01:12:57,297
you were going to the hospital-

1375
01:12:57,329 --> 01:12:58,406
The car was in front of me.

1376
01:12:58,430 --> 01:12:59,474
What hospital are you going to?

1377
01:12:59,498 --> 01:13:01,934
N♪♪♪♪, that was a pro.

1378
01:13:01,967 --> 01:13:04,570
That wasn't no bunch of
scattered fuckin' bullet holes.

1379
01:13:04,604 --> 01:13:08,375
Them bullet holes went
straight across like that.

1380
01:13:08,408 --> 01:13:12,880
Wasn't no scattered bullets
like in the BMW, the Tupac car.

1381
01:13:12,912 --> 01:13:17,183
It was a straight nine.

1382
01:13:17,216 --> 01:13:20,554
Russell Poole gave up his career
to solve this murder

1383
01:13:20,586 --> 01:13:23,589
and was vilified
by his superiors.

1384
01:13:23,622 --> 01:13:27,960
I was told not to talk about
the Biggie Smalls killing.

1385
01:13:27,993 --> 01:13:29,929
During the course
of the investigation

1386
01:13:29,962 --> 01:13:35,368
of David Mack
possibly being involved

1387
01:13:35,402 --> 01:13:37,471
in the Biggie Smalls case,
I was told,

1388
01:13:37,503 --> 01:13:41,408
"Hey, Mack had already gone down
for the bank robbery.

1389
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,110
Let's not get into any more
controversy,"

1390
01:13:44,144 --> 01:13:46,380
and that was that.

1391
01:13:46,412 --> 01:13:50,349
And there was no urgency
to investigate David Mack

1392
01:13:50,382 --> 01:13:52,118
for the killing
of Biggie Smalls.

1393
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,323
Four years later,
in the year 2000,

1394
01:13:57,357 --> 01:14:00,460
when still nobody had been
charged for the murders,

1395
01:14:00,493 --> 01:14:02,396
we take Russell to New York

1396
01:14:02,429 --> 01:14:04,364
and introduce him
to Voletta Wallace,

1397
01:14:04,396 --> 01:14:08,135
Biggie's mom,
who is equally frustrated.

1398
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:09,402
Hi.

1399
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:13,573
So this is...

1400
01:14:13,605 --> 01:14:15,041
Hi, Mrs. Wallace, how you doin'?

1401
01:14:15,074 --> 01:14:17,376
I'm Russ Poole.

1402
01:14:17,409 --> 01:14:18,577
Nice to meet you.

1403
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:20,579
Oh, hey there.

1404
01:14:20,613 --> 01:14:21,615
How are ya?

1405
01:14:21,648 --> 01:14:24,451
Nice to see you again.

1406
01:14:24,484 --> 01:14:26,586
Hi there.

1407
01:14:26,618 --> 01:14:28,621
You know, there are
some private investigators

1408
01:14:28,654 --> 01:14:31,524
- working on some good leads.
- Uh-huh.

1409
01:14:31,558 --> 01:14:34,994
And if they come up
with some good stuff,

1410
01:14:35,028 --> 01:14:37,130
we'll be sure
to come back out here.

1411
01:14:37,162 --> 01:14:38,464
Okay.

1412
01:14:38,497 --> 01:14:42,134
Voletta went on to file
a $500 million lawsuit,

1413
01:14:42,167 --> 01:14:45,037
an estimate of her son's
lifetime's earnings,

1414
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:47,674
against the city of Los Angeles.

1415
01:14:47,707 --> 01:14:51,144
All it was is a Puffy
and Suge Knight war.

1416
01:14:51,176 --> 01:14:54,146
So if that's the case,
Puffy, Suge Knight,

1417
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,283
solve your damn problem.

1418
01:14:56,315 --> 01:14:58,585
They should have done that.

1419
01:14:58,618 --> 01:15:01,688
So that's where the East Coast,
West Coast thing came.

1420
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,290
Everybody wants to be famous,

1421
01:15:03,323 --> 01:15:04,992
so they went to the newspaper

1422
01:15:05,024 --> 01:15:06,525
and gave their own
little stories

1423
01:15:06,559 --> 01:15:09,429
and everybody start,
"East Coast, West Coast."

1424
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:10,696
East Coast was Puffy.

1425
01:15:10,729 --> 01:15:12,264
West Coast was Suge Knight.

1426
01:15:12,297 --> 01:15:13,399
East Coast was Biggie.

1427
01:15:13,433 --> 01:15:15,034
West Coast was Tupac.

1428
01:15:15,068 --> 01:15:16,168
Come on now.

1429
01:15:16,202 --> 01:15:17,771
You're messing with lives here.

1430
01:15:17,804 --> 01:15:19,605
And that's exactly
what happened.

1431
01:15:19,639 --> 01:15:22,542
Two lives were lost
as a result of what?

1432
01:15:22,574 --> 01:15:24,077
Stupidity?

1433
01:15:26,112 --> 01:15:29,082
Years later I discovered
that this earlier film I did

1434
01:15:29,114 --> 01:15:32,719
with Voletta did prompt
an FBI investigation

1435
01:15:32,752 --> 01:15:35,122
into possible LAPD involvement

1436
01:15:35,154 --> 01:15:38,524
with her son's murder.

1437
01:15:38,558 --> 01:15:41,661
I literally was
watching TV one night

1438
01:15:41,693 --> 01:15:45,464
and I came across
this documentary.

1439
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:48,234
It was on the whole
Biggie murder.

1440
01:15:48,268 --> 01:15:52,105
So I wrote up a long report
to my bosses.

1441
01:15:52,137 --> 01:15:53,340
They all signed off on it.

1442
01:15:53,372 --> 01:15:54,308
They said, "Yeah, you know what?

1443
01:15:54,341 --> 01:15:57,677
You got something here,
let's run with it."

1444
01:15:57,710 --> 01:16:00,413
So that's how, that's how
the whole case got started.

1445
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:06,552
The LAPD did not welcome
this FBI investigation

1446
01:16:06,586 --> 01:16:09,088
and set up their own,
looking for evidence

1447
01:16:09,122 --> 01:16:12,692
to counterattack
the Biggie Smalls lawsuit.

1448
01:16:12,725 --> 01:16:16,463
Greg Kading was the head
of Operation Transparency.

1449
01:16:16,496 --> 01:16:20,734
Yeah, so as that lawsuit kinda
weaved in and out of the courts,

1450
01:16:20,766 --> 01:16:24,171
it came to a point where
the LAPD realized that,

1451
01:16:24,203 --> 01:16:27,573
you know, in civil court just
about anything could happen,

1452
01:16:27,607 --> 01:16:29,418
and they thought it would be
in their best interest

1453
01:16:29,442 --> 01:16:31,845
to relook at the case.

1454
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:38,318
The City of LA prevented
the lead FBI investigator,

1455
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:41,787
Phil Carson, from testifying
at the trial.

1456
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:43,723
They said, "Yeah.

1457
01:16:43,756 --> 01:16:46,660
You're not looking
into solving a murder.

1458
01:16:46,693 --> 01:16:48,728
You're looking into
solving a murder

1459
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:52,731
that involved the LAPD
orchestrating it."

1460
01:16:52,765 --> 01:16:55,469
They said, "You guys gotta
squash this subpoena

1461
01:16:55,502 --> 01:16:59,339
because if Phil testifies,
we got at least a 50/50 chance

1462
01:16:59,372 --> 01:17:02,509
of losing
a $500 million lawsuit."

1463
01:17:02,542 --> 01:17:04,644
And to be honest with ya,
they're right.

1464
01:17:04,676 --> 01:17:08,681
They got a... I think it's better
than a 50/50 chance.

1465
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:14,854
Greg Kading, who headed up
the LAPD task force,

1466
01:17:14,887 --> 01:17:17,524
disputes that LAPD cops
were involved

1467
01:17:17,556 --> 01:17:19,525
in the hit on Biggie Smalls.

1468
01:17:19,559 --> 01:17:21,261
He not only wrote a book,

1469
01:17:21,293 --> 01:17:25,232
but was involved in a major
series on Netflix and on BET

1470
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:29,402
and his views
are widely accepted today.

1471
01:17:29,435 --> 01:17:31,638
He says that officers
Mack and Perez

1472
01:17:31,671 --> 01:17:33,573
never worked at Death Row,

1473
01:17:33,605 --> 01:17:35,375
but we came up with new evidence

1474
01:17:35,408 --> 01:17:37,844
showing Greg Kading
is incorrect.

1475
01:17:37,877 --> 01:17:40,347
David Mack, the LAPD officer,

1476
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:42,882
never, ever worked or was
affiliated and associated

1477
01:17:42,916 --> 01:17:44,384
with Death Row Records at all.

1478
01:17:44,417 --> 01:17:46,386
Neither was Rafael Perez.

1479
01:17:46,418 --> 01:17:47,921
And those were
the two individuals

1480
01:17:47,953 --> 01:17:51,291
that jailhouse informants
had claimed

1481
01:17:51,323 --> 01:17:52,925
were part
of Death Row's security.

1482
01:17:52,958 --> 01:17:54,627
They weren't, ever.

1483
01:17:54,661 --> 01:17:56,429
And that was looked into
not only by

1484
01:17:56,461 --> 01:17:59,498
the original investigators
back in the mid-'90s,

1485
01:17:59,532 --> 01:18:01,635
but also by our task force.

1486
01:18:06,573 --> 01:18:08,408
Officer David Mack
was apparently

1487
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,577
a charismatic and social guy.

1488
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:15,415
So many people at Death Row
remember him.

1489
01:18:15,448 --> 01:18:16,950
I knew David very well.

1490
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:19,786
I was actually quite shocked
when I saw David

1491
01:18:19,818 --> 01:18:21,854
and he was an LAPD.

1492
01:18:21,887 --> 01:18:23,957
Very surprised.

1493
01:18:23,989 --> 01:18:27,960
And he came with me
to the video shoot

1494
01:18:27,993 --> 01:18:32,431
when we were doing Mac Mall
and Ray Luv's video shoot

1495
01:18:32,465 --> 01:18:36,469
and Tupac was directing
and he wanted to be connected

1496
01:18:36,502 --> 01:18:40,640
because he wanted to do
off-duty work for rap artists.

1497
01:18:40,672 --> 01:18:44,210
And I brought him
to that video shoot

1498
01:18:44,243 --> 01:18:48,614
and a little later,
I found out he was working

1499
01:18:48,648 --> 01:18:51,384
with all the rappers I knew,
off-duty

1500
01:18:51,417 --> 01:18:55,622
and a lot of other cops
that I knew.

1501
01:18:59,259 --> 01:19:02,662
Leila isn't the only one
who remembers Mack and Perez.

1502
01:19:02,694 --> 01:19:03,829
Yeah, I seen it.

1503
01:19:03,863 --> 01:19:06,600
I seen David Mack
plenty of time.

1504
01:19:06,632 --> 01:19:08,969
They had to come to the party
'cause, you know,

1505
01:19:09,002 --> 01:19:10,971
never knew when
it was gonna jump off.

1506
01:19:12,838 --> 01:19:14,407
Hung out with 'em.

1507
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:17,009
Been in the room with 'em.

1508
01:19:17,042 --> 01:19:17,978
Been around 'em.

1509
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:21,513
You know, ever they been around,
I was around.

1510
01:19:23,283 --> 01:19:25,719
And what, who was the other one,
Rafael Perez?

1511
01:19:25,752 --> 01:19:26,753
Rafael Perez.

1512
01:19:26,786 --> 01:19:28,320
Seen him too.

1513
01:19:28,354 --> 01:19:29,588
Yep, all that.

1514
01:19:29,622 --> 01:19:32,559
But like I said, shit, they
wasn't no different from us.

1515
01:19:32,591 --> 01:19:35,427
The only thing,
they had badges, we didn't.

1516
01:19:35,461 --> 01:19:37,797
So, we have... you know,
we might be somewhere,

1517
01:19:37,829 --> 01:19:39,698
you know, it go like this,
we get into it

1518
01:19:39,732 --> 01:19:41,533
with whoever
we get into it with.

1519
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:45,372
And when the police rush us,
our police rush them.

1520
01:19:45,404 --> 01:19:46,672
That's how it went.

1521
01:19:49,942 --> 01:19:52,545
That's how the get down went.

1522
01:19:52,577 --> 01:19:54,813
Yes, Officer Perez.

1523
01:19:54,846 --> 01:19:56,582
He was friends with Suge.

1524
01:19:56,616 --> 01:19:59,719
I seen him up there
several, several times.

1525
01:19:59,752 --> 01:20:00,820
Several times.

1526
01:20:00,853 --> 01:20:02,788
And he was friends with Suge.

1527
01:20:02,822 --> 01:20:05,558
I seen him in uniform
and out of uniform.

1528
01:20:05,591 --> 01:20:06,969
And when you're out of uniform,
you try to be...

1529
01:20:06,993 --> 01:20:08,762
try to look like
he cool and shit.

1530
01:20:08,795 --> 01:20:11,598
He wear little accents of red,
you know?

1531
01:20:11,631 --> 01:20:13,900
You know, like try to fit in,
I knew who he...

1532
01:20:13,933 --> 01:20:15,935
I'm like, "Ah,
that's the the police dude."

1533
01:20:15,967 --> 01:20:17,903
But I never knew
that he was the part of

1534
01:20:17,936 --> 01:20:20,674
that Rampart Division shit
until I seen him.

1535
01:20:20,707 --> 01:20:21,808
I'm like, "Oh!"

1536
01:20:21,841 --> 01:20:24,043
Out of all the police
in the world that I remember,

1537
01:20:24,077 --> 01:20:26,780
I remember him
for being up at Death Row.

1538
01:20:26,813 --> 01:20:28,315
And then there was another one.

1539
01:20:28,348 --> 01:20:31,951
The one that they say
killed Biggie, right?

1540
01:20:31,984 --> 01:20:33,453
Black dude.

1541
01:20:35,921 --> 01:20:38,824
He used to be up there too.

1542
01:20:38,858 --> 01:20:41,561
I don't know if he did this,

1543
01:20:41,594 --> 01:20:44,864
but the one that they had
on the news,

1544
01:20:44,896 --> 01:20:47,734
he was there a lot.

1545
01:20:48,935 --> 01:20:50,503
- Hi.
- Hey.

1546
01:20:50,536 --> 01:20:52,538
Good morning,
very good of you to see us.

1547
01:20:52,572 --> 01:20:55,108
What makes Kading's comments
about Mack and Perez

1548
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,344
look especially weak is that

1549
01:20:57,377 --> 01:20:59,779
even Police Chief
Bernard Parks himself

1550
01:20:59,811 --> 01:21:01,680
said they worked for Death Row.

1551
01:21:01,713 --> 01:21:04,551
We know that David Mack
and Rafael Perez

1552
01:21:04,583 --> 01:21:08,921
both worked security
in this rap culture,

1553
01:21:08,954 --> 01:21:10,790
as it relates to
some of these artists,

1554
01:21:10,823 --> 01:21:12,792
- but we have had...
- Pertaining to Death Row.

1555
01:21:12,824 --> 01:21:15,828
Death Row Records,
but we have no information

1556
01:21:15,862 --> 01:21:19,599
nor has any information
come forward that would cause us

1557
01:21:19,631 --> 01:21:21,835
to believe that either one
of them are suspects.

1558
01:21:21,868 --> 01:21:23,970
If, in our continuing
investigation,

1559
01:21:24,002 --> 01:21:27,072
we uncover facts
that we can prove,

1560
01:21:27,105 --> 01:21:29,876
then we will continue moving
forward to clear that case,

1561
01:21:29,908 --> 01:21:32,444
but until then,
what we've seen so far

1562
01:21:32,478 --> 01:21:35,148
is merely undocumented
speculation

1563
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:38,984
that has not led
to any significant leads.

1564
01:21:39,018 --> 01:21:41,488
It would appear that
Police Chief Bernard Parks

1565
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,424
should have been well-acquainted
with Mack and Perez,

1566
01:21:44,457 --> 01:21:46,793
according to Xavier Hermosillo.

1567
01:21:46,826 --> 01:21:49,796
One of the most shocking things
in that Board of Rights,

1568
01:21:49,828 --> 01:21:53,699
or anything that I've ever done
in over 30 years,

1569
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:58,137
was there was a photograph of
Rafael Perez and David Mack,

1570
01:21:58,171 --> 01:22:02,708
who were the two police officers
that were bad, bad, bad news,

1571
01:22:02,742 --> 01:22:05,078
and a woman
standing in the middle.

1572
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:07,546
And they were all dressed
in red, from head to toe.

1573
01:22:07,579 --> 01:22:11,583
A hat, whatever, which is
the color of the Blood gangs.

1574
01:22:11,617 --> 01:22:14,521
There's the Crips
and their clothes are blue.

1575
01:22:14,554 --> 01:22:18,425
And so these guys
were dressed in red

1576
01:22:18,457 --> 01:22:20,192
and they were standing
behind a table.

1577
01:22:20,225 --> 01:22:22,828
There was a, a cake
that said something like,

1578
01:22:22,862 --> 01:22:25,965
"Bloods rule," or, you know,
something like that.

1579
01:22:25,997 --> 01:22:29,001
And I was startled,
because I recognized the woman,

1580
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:32,572
and it was the daughter
of Police Chief Bernard Parks,

1581
01:22:32,604 --> 01:22:35,741
who it appeared was
a Blood gang member.

1582
01:22:35,774 --> 01:22:38,777
That's incredible.

1583
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:40,846
Yeah, tell me about it.

1584
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:43,616
I looked at this thing
and I turned to my two partners

1585
01:22:43,649 --> 01:22:46,719
and I said,
"Is this who I think it is?"

1586
01:22:46,752 --> 01:22:48,588
And they said, "Yeah."

1587
01:22:51,858 --> 01:22:54,092
The Biggie Smalls' estate
lawyers were never able

1588
01:22:54,126 --> 01:22:55,994
to get a copy
of this photograph,

1589
01:22:56,028 --> 01:22:59,565
which mysteriously disappeared.

1590
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:01,634
It is also alleged
that Michelle Parks

1591
01:23:01,667 --> 01:23:06,706
and Officer Rafael Perez
were in a dating relationship.

1592
01:23:06,738 --> 01:23:10,909
Officer David Mack was later
convicted for this bank robbery.

1593
01:23:10,943 --> 01:23:13,079
It's alleged that on the night
of the robbery,

1594
01:23:13,112 --> 01:23:15,547
Michelle Parks, Mack and Perez

1595
01:23:15,581 --> 01:23:18,150
celebrated at the Rio Hotel
in Las Vegas.

1596
01:23:20,552 --> 01:23:22,788
When, on a subsequent occasion,

1597
01:23:22,822 --> 01:23:27,659
Michelle Parks was arrested
in Las Vegas for narcotics,

1598
01:23:27,693 --> 01:23:30,563
it is Rafael Perez
who posts bail.

1599
01:23:33,866 --> 01:23:37,903
Xavier also mentions the account
of this man, Boagni,

1600
01:23:37,936 --> 01:23:40,640
and another cellmate
of Officer Perez

1601
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:43,208
who alleged Perez took part
in Biggie's murder

1602
01:23:43,242 --> 01:23:47,046
and were threatened with death
if they testified against him.

1603
01:23:47,078 --> 01:23:48,648
I have a great admiration
and respect

1604
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,157
for the Los Angeles
Police Department,

1605
01:23:50,181 --> 01:23:52,551
but this is the one time...
and I've been around

1606
01:23:52,585 --> 01:23:56,055
the department 40 years
as a civilian.

1607
01:23:56,087 --> 01:24:00,192
And one of the things that
I think bothered me the most

1608
01:24:00,225 --> 01:24:04,196
was how this one case,

1609
01:24:04,229 --> 01:24:06,899
being the murder
of Biggie Smalls,

1610
01:24:06,933 --> 01:24:09,068
and everything
that emanated from it,

1611
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:11,136
was really problematic.

1612
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:14,207
And in this particular case
with these two prisoners,

1613
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:16,742
they were visited
at their prisons,

1614
01:24:16,775 --> 01:24:20,813
thousand miles apart,
and told not to come and testify

1615
01:24:20,845 --> 01:24:23,750
at the Board of Rights hearing
that I was involved with.

1616
01:24:23,783 --> 01:24:26,252
And they were told
that if they did testify,

1617
01:24:26,284 --> 01:24:29,689
that friends of Perez
who were in prison

1618
01:24:29,721 --> 01:24:31,957
would have them killed
for testifying,

1619
01:24:31,991 --> 01:24:33,926
for snitching.

1620
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:37,130
That I found to be,
you know, just abhorrent,

1621
01:24:37,162 --> 01:24:38,997
just illegal.

1622
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:41,701
And it was LAPD police officers
who told them?

1623
01:24:41,734 --> 01:24:42,602
It was two detectives.

1624
01:24:42,635 --> 01:24:45,338
And, uh, we heard it
for the first time

1625
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:49,676
when Boagni, Kenny Boagni,
sort of blurted it out.

1626
01:24:49,708 --> 01:24:52,679
I asked him a question
and he started,

1627
01:24:52,711 --> 01:24:54,880
you know, kind of shaking
a little bit.

1628
01:24:54,913 --> 01:24:56,849
And then the advocate
for the department,

1629
01:24:56,881 --> 01:24:58,650
who was like the prosecutor,

1630
01:24:58,684 --> 01:25:00,086
he jumps up
and he gets in his face

1631
01:25:00,118 --> 01:25:01,787
and he says,
"Keep your mouth shut.

1632
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:03,756
You were told
not to talk about that."

1633
01:25:03,788 --> 01:25:05,724
That was so unreal.

1634
01:25:05,757 --> 01:25:08,027
I'd never seen that
in all the years

1635
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:10,863
of being involved
with the department.

1636
01:25:16,635 --> 01:25:19,738
Shortly afterwards, I received
a phone call from Boagni,

1637
01:25:19,771 --> 01:25:21,940
who is currently serving
a 40-year sentence

1638
01:25:21,974 --> 01:25:23,676
in state prison.

1639
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:27,913
This call is from an inmate
at a federal prison.

1640
01:25:27,947 --> 01:25:29,716
So are you saying
that Suge Knight

1641
01:25:29,748 --> 01:25:32,184
was behind the hit, though?

1642
01:25:40,693 --> 01:25:42,729
So which, which offi...

1643
01:25:42,761 --> 01:25:45,297
which officers are you saying
were implicated

1644
01:25:45,331 --> 01:25:47,667
in the murder of Biggie Smalls?

1645
01:25:47,699 --> 01:25:49,335
This call
and your telephone number

1646
01:25:49,368 --> 01:25:51,137
will be monitored and recorded.

1647
01:26:15,161 --> 01:26:17,363
It is this testimony from Boagni

1648
01:26:17,395 --> 01:26:19,732
that is concealed by the LAPD

1649
01:26:19,765 --> 01:26:22,869
and kept from
the Biggie Smalls lawyers.

1650
01:26:22,902 --> 01:26:25,738
The LAPD will be fined
$1.1 million

1651
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:29,041
by a US district judge
for concealing evidence.

1652
01:26:42,287 --> 01:26:44,424
However, it's Kading's
unfounded theory

1653
01:26:44,457 --> 01:26:47,727
that, over time,
with podcasts and TV shows,

1654
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,762
is accepted as valid today.

1655
01:26:50,796 --> 01:26:52,065
Whereas, Russell Poole,

1656
01:26:52,098 --> 01:26:54,900
an outstanding police officer
for 20 years,

1657
01:26:54,934 --> 01:26:58,404
is discredited and ostracized.

1658
01:26:58,436 --> 01:27:02,041
And I mean,
I almost took my life,

1659
01:27:02,073 --> 01:27:06,211
but it was my kids that actually
saved me, okay?

1660
01:27:06,244 --> 01:27:08,413
And it hurt.

1661
01:27:08,447 --> 01:27:11,050
I was betrayed
by my own department

1662
01:27:11,082 --> 01:27:12,984
because of the core values

1663
01:27:13,018 --> 01:27:15,188
that the Los Angeles
Police Department

1664
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:17,889
preached from day one.

1665
01:27:17,922 --> 01:27:21,460
Honesty, integrity.

1666
01:27:21,493 --> 01:27:25,331
Okay, tell the truth.

1667
01:27:25,363 --> 01:27:28,067
Swear to tell the truth,
nothing but the truth,

1668
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:30,203
so help you God.

1669
01:27:30,235 --> 01:27:31,403
Do a good job.

1670
01:27:31,436 --> 01:27:33,338
Do a thorough investigation.

1671
01:27:33,372 --> 01:27:35,074
Work for the community.

1672
01:27:35,107 --> 01:27:39,112
Uh, I believed
in the oath of office.

1673
01:27:39,144 --> 01:27:43,014
I believed in the protect
and serving the people,

1674
01:27:43,047 --> 01:27:43,916
I really did.

1675
01:27:43,948 --> 01:27:48,386
But on the inside,
behind closed doors,

1676
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:50,489
that it wasn't the case.

1677
01:27:50,523 --> 01:27:55,862
When it came to cops
being investigated,

1678
01:27:55,894 --> 01:27:57,162
we weren't serving the public

1679
01:27:57,195 --> 01:27:59,931
the way we should have
served the public.

1680
01:27:59,965 --> 01:28:01,132
And when I'm assigned to...

1681
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:04,470
Solving these murders would
dominate Russell's life.

1682
01:28:04,502 --> 01:28:06,805
He died tragically
of a heart attack

1683
01:28:06,838 --> 01:28:09,408
at LA Sheriff's Headquarters
during a meeting

1684
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,210
about the Biggie Smalls murder.

1685
01:28:11,243 --> 01:28:14,847
...not be suppressed
and kept away from the public.

1686
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:17,083
A lot of what Russ Poole did...

1687
01:28:17,116 --> 01:28:20,453
telling you right now,
that guy was legit.

1688
01:28:20,485 --> 01:28:24,055
For people to say that
he was a disgraced detective,

1689
01:28:24,088 --> 01:28:25,224
it's not fair.

1690
01:28:25,256 --> 01:28:26,925
The guy knew what he was doing.

1691
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:29,127
He was actually a good cop,

1692
01:28:29,161 --> 01:28:31,329
and they did what they could
to shut him down.

1693
01:28:31,363 --> 01:28:32,932
And I know a lot of people
like to say,

1694
01:28:32,965 --> 01:28:35,034
"Oh, he keeps going down
this theory."

1695
01:28:35,067 --> 01:28:38,203
No, his theory is correct.

1696
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:49,080
The only time I met Suge Knight
was in 2002

1697
01:28:49,113 --> 01:28:50,582
when he was serving nine years

1698
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:53,452
for the Orlando Anderson fight.

1699
01:28:53,484 --> 01:28:56,221
Both Kading and Russell agree
Suge Knight commissioned

1700
01:28:56,255 --> 01:28:58,190
the Biggie Smalls murder,

1701
01:28:58,224 --> 01:29:01,260
yet he's never been charged.

1702
01:29:01,292 --> 01:29:04,262
When I went to visit him
at Mule Creek State Prison,

1703
01:29:04,296 --> 01:29:06,399
Death Row
was already collapsing.

1704
01:29:06,431 --> 01:29:08,466
Both Dre and Snoop had left,

1705
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:12,971
and Suge Knight was trying to
manage Death Row from prison.

1706
01:29:13,005 --> 01:29:14,373
Oh, okay.

1707
01:29:30,989 --> 01:29:32,090
Okay.

1708
01:29:32,125 --> 01:29:35,094
By now, Suge had mentally
moved on to his new enemy,

1709
01:29:35,127 --> 01:29:37,230
Snoop, who had just left
Death Row.

1710
01:29:37,262 --> 01:29:39,364
If you hear about
a lot of the artists,

1711
01:29:39,398 --> 01:29:41,175
used to be some of them
used to be on Death Row,

1712
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:43,536
some of them on other labels,
you might hear them,

1713
01:29:43,568 --> 01:29:46,905
um, getting caught up
with drugs,

1714
01:29:46,939 --> 01:29:48,941
getting caught with a gun,
stab somebody,

1715
01:29:48,974 --> 01:29:50,376
do those type of crimes,

1716
01:29:50,408 --> 01:29:52,010
and they're gonna come
to prison.

1717
01:29:52,043 --> 01:29:53,120
One of the reason
they're gonna come...

1718
01:29:53,144 --> 01:29:55,447
- You mean like Snoop?
- Oh, Snoop would never come.

1719
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,916
I mean, Snoop is on... you know,
we'd be at the murder trial

1720
01:29:57,949 --> 01:29:59,885
for him, but then
he was on probation.

1721
01:29:59,918 --> 01:30:02,488
Then he got caught
with two ounces of marijuana.

1722
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,822
Then he got caught with guns.

1723
01:30:03,855 --> 01:30:06,324
And each time, it's nothing,
they're not gonna violate him,

1724
01:30:06,358 --> 01:30:08,194
because for the street guys,

1725
01:30:08,226 --> 01:30:09,571
street guys know
what I'm talking about.

1726
01:30:09,595 --> 01:30:10,963
There's no puzzle.

1727
01:30:10,996 --> 01:30:12,230
I mean, if you get a guy that

1728
01:30:12,264 --> 01:30:14,541
constantly getting in trouble
and never got come to prison,

1729
01:30:14,565 --> 01:30:16,534
that's because
he's an informant, he's a rat.

1730
01:30:16,568 --> 01:30:18,637
- Yeah, yeah.
- A snitch, you know.

1731
01:30:18,671 --> 01:30:21,007
And they more important
to the police

1732
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,009
on the streets than in here,

1733
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:25,044
because they let them know
what's going on.

1734
01:30:25,077 --> 01:30:26,945
They might say what
they saw by telling

1735
01:30:26,979 --> 01:30:28,648
three or four, five other guys.

1736
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,549
You know, I'm from Compton
and I'm...

1737
01:30:30,582 --> 01:30:32,018
a rat is the lowest you can go.

1738
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:33,386
A rat will do anything.

1739
01:30:33,418 --> 01:30:35,520
This was Suge's message
to Snoop.

1740
01:31:01,479 --> 01:31:04,683
When Suge got back out in 2001,

1741
01:31:04,716 --> 01:31:08,420
you know, he changed the name
to The Row.

1742
01:31:08,453 --> 01:31:09,287
It never rose.

1743
01:31:09,322 --> 01:31:13,059
It never,
it never prospered at all.

1744
01:31:13,091 --> 01:31:16,429
Suge was just living off
of Death Row reputation.

1745
01:31:16,461 --> 01:31:18,205
He was living off
of the reputation of people

1746
01:31:18,229 --> 01:31:21,599
that wasn't even alive no more.

1747
01:31:21,632 --> 01:31:25,570
So I left Death Row
in like 2002,

1748
01:31:25,604 --> 01:31:27,039
'cause it was really over with.

1749
01:31:27,072 --> 01:31:28,607
It was just like...

1750
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:32,378
to me, it was just like
a little gang hangout.

1751
01:31:37,683 --> 01:31:39,452
How you doing, man?

1752
01:31:39,484 --> 01:31:40,485
Yeah.

1753
01:31:40,519 --> 01:31:42,754
Once Suge lost everything,
he lost everything.

1754
01:31:42,787 --> 01:31:45,056
He lost his accountants,
he lost everything.

1755
01:31:45,090 --> 01:31:47,760
He didn't have nobody
really on his side.

1756
01:31:47,792 --> 01:31:50,563
And Jimmy Iovine, them,
they businessmen,

1757
01:31:50,595 --> 01:31:52,530
they was consistently
getting the money.

1758
01:31:57,036 --> 01:31:58,003
I need $50.

1759
01:31:58,037 --> 01:32:00,039
Can I have $50?

1760
01:32:00,072 --> 01:32:02,675
Where did all the money end up?

1761
01:32:02,707 --> 01:32:03,675
I don't know.

1762
01:32:03,708 --> 01:32:07,345
I know a fool and his money
shall soon part.

1763
01:32:07,378 --> 01:32:10,382
I know that the fool
lost his money

1764
01:32:10,416 --> 01:32:12,351
from doing foolish things,

1765
01:32:12,384 --> 01:32:13,418
and that's Suge.

1766
01:32:13,452 --> 01:32:16,021
We know the big boys
got the bag.

1767
01:32:16,055 --> 01:32:18,491
They took the bag.

1768
01:32:18,524 --> 01:32:19,358
David Kenner ain't...

1769
01:32:19,391 --> 01:32:22,427
I guarantee you,
David ain't broke.

1770
01:32:22,461 --> 01:32:23,729
Ted Field, come on.

1771
01:32:23,761 --> 01:32:27,232
That's Marshall Field's brother.

1772
01:32:27,265 --> 01:32:31,469
The Seagrams family
is intertwined in that.

1773
01:32:31,502 --> 01:32:33,405
They're not broke.

1774
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:35,775
But, you know,
Suge was standing up

1775
01:32:35,808 --> 01:32:39,578
in the wrong way
to the wrong people.

1776
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:43,181
You know, you can't scare
Jimmy Iovine.

1777
01:32:43,215 --> 01:32:45,451
Don't even make sense.

1778
01:32:45,484 --> 01:32:46,484
Hey.

1779
01:32:48,186 --> 01:32:49,597
That's coming from
the East to the West.

1780
01:32:49,621 --> 01:32:50,689
Hey, check this out.

1781
01:32:50,721 --> 01:32:52,224
This my homeboy.

1782
01:32:52,256 --> 01:32:53,826
BJ, you know what I'm saying?

1783
01:32:53,859 --> 01:32:55,761
My PO let me out here,
but I fuck with me,

1784
01:32:55,793 --> 01:32:58,264
my n♪♪♪♪s, right here,
but this BJ is my n♪♪♪♪.

1785
01:32:58,296 --> 01:32:59,799
This man is like my brother.

1786
01:32:59,832 --> 01:33:01,809
I'm gonna fuck n♪♪♪♪s up
behind the homeboy, n♪♪♪♪.

1787
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:04,235
Suge, money wasn't the way
it was no more.

1788
01:33:04,269 --> 01:33:05,204
Now what?

1789
01:33:05,237 --> 01:33:08,340
You know, he wasn't making
no more money,

1790
01:33:08,372 --> 01:33:09,817
so when he wasn't making
no more money,

1791
01:33:09,841 --> 01:33:12,844
the people that he want to get
from the neighborhood,

1792
01:33:12,877 --> 01:33:17,549
he wasn't paying them,
so they start dropping off.

1793
01:33:17,582 --> 01:33:19,617
And that's why, a lot of times
used to see Suge,

1794
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:20,653
he used to be by himself.

1795
01:33:24,323 --> 01:33:26,592
Once the people on the street
seeing that,

1796
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:28,194
they start attacking Suge.

1797
01:33:58,422 --> 01:34:00,391
He got shot
at Chris Brown's party.

1798
01:34:00,425 --> 01:34:02,795
He got knocked out.

1799
01:34:02,827 --> 01:34:06,331
Well, that looked
like Suge, bro.

1800
01:34:06,364 --> 01:34:08,733
Some people was like,
you know what I'm saying,

1801
01:34:08,766 --> 01:34:11,804
"You ain't nothing."

1802
01:34:11,836 --> 01:34:14,305
I mean, things start
to happen to him

1803
01:34:14,338 --> 01:34:16,641
that would never
would have happened.

1804
01:34:16,675 --> 01:34:19,244
But once...
it's just like Moses.

1805
01:34:19,278 --> 01:34:21,180
Moses had a veil.

1806
01:34:21,212 --> 01:34:22,290
He didn't want nobody to see

1807
01:34:22,314 --> 01:34:25,317
that the light was gone
on his face.

1808
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:29,588
So Suge's veil start to appear

1809
01:34:29,621 --> 01:34:32,625
that it... that these people
weren't behind him no more.

1810
01:34:32,658 --> 01:34:35,427
So the people
weren't scared no more.

1811
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:37,229
All I know is,

1812
01:34:37,261 --> 01:34:40,565
none of the guys that
was working for Death Row

1813
01:34:40,599 --> 01:34:44,470
got a house,
didn't get a car out of it,

1814
01:34:46,704 --> 01:34:49,175
don't have a big bank account.

1815
01:34:49,207 --> 01:34:51,309
Everybody is just back...

1816
01:34:51,342 --> 01:34:53,345
it's like the Cinderella story.

1817
01:34:53,377 --> 01:34:54,589
Twelve o'clock,
everything changed

1818
01:34:54,613 --> 01:34:55,915
back into the same thing,

1819
01:34:55,948 --> 01:34:57,650
changed back into what it is.

1820
01:34:57,683 --> 01:34:59,484
That's how it is in Compton.

1821
01:34:59,518 --> 01:35:02,421
Everybody just changed back
into what they were.

1822
01:35:02,453 --> 01:35:03,322
You know what I'm saying?

1823
01:35:03,354 --> 01:35:04,689
It was good.

1824
01:35:04,723 --> 01:35:08,894
Tupac, they had Tupac
for 11 months, I think,

1825
01:35:08,926 --> 01:35:11,863
and everybody was good.

1826
01:35:11,896 --> 01:35:13,732
But soon as he passed,

1827
01:35:13,765 --> 01:35:17,703
everybody turned back into

1828
01:35:17,735 --> 01:35:20,405
just a regular old cat
in the neighborhood.

1829
01:35:20,439 --> 01:35:24,409
It was all gone,
from rags to riches to worse.

1830
01:35:25,711 --> 01:35:28,414
Or to the dirt.

1831
01:35:29,915 --> 01:35:31,617
This is Rosecrans and Atlantic.

1832
01:35:31,649 --> 01:35:34,452
I believe this is still Compton.

1833
01:35:34,485 --> 01:35:36,221
Looks like more than likely
they were shot

1834
01:35:36,255 --> 01:35:38,489
while trying to fill up
their car with gas.

1835
01:35:38,523 --> 01:35:41,293
Suge Knight,
struggling to maintain control,

1836
01:35:41,326 --> 01:35:44,395
created a rivalry between
his own Blood gang members,

1837
01:35:44,429 --> 01:35:46,465
who started killing each other.

1838
01:35:46,497 --> 01:35:48,800
A lot of them died for him,

1839
01:35:48,833 --> 01:35:51,336
including my brother.

1840
01:35:51,369 --> 01:35:56,742
Some guy got out of a van
and AK'ed him down.

1841
01:35:56,774 --> 01:36:00,845
I think he got shot
nine times, ten times,

1842
01:36:00,878 --> 01:36:04,983
and he was laying there.

1843
01:36:05,016 --> 01:36:07,385
I've seen the scene
so many times.

1844
01:36:07,418 --> 01:36:10,889
I've seen what happened
to him so many times.

1845
01:36:10,921 --> 01:36:13,692
You know...

1846
01:36:13,725 --> 01:36:15,494
I can say I can't even imagine

1847
01:36:15,527 --> 01:36:17,262
that somebody would do him
like that,

1848
01:36:17,296 --> 01:36:19,030
but that's how we was living,

1849
01:36:19,064 --> 01:36:21,767
that's the shit we was doing
when we was doing drive-bys.

1850
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:24,603
That's the shit
that I lived for,

1851
01:36:24,635 --> 01:36:28,339
that I had to go out
and live like that.

1852
01:36:28,372 --> 01:36:31,476
So, seeing my brother,

1853
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:34,546
it was, it was so different.

1854
01:36:34,578 --> 01:36:37,949
It was like I'm...
I had to step outside of myself

1855
01:36:37,983 --> 01:36:41,654
and to see him laying there

1856
01:36:41,686 --> 01:36:45,457
with his eyes open and just...

1857
01:36:45,489 --> 01:36:48,693
I had, I had so much anger
in me.

1858
01:36:52,096 --> 01:36:54,599
It's, it's... hm...

1859
01:36:57,769 --> 01:36:59,905
It's rough
talking about him.

1860
01:37:02,741 --> 01:37:05,978
Every time they mention
his name, I get choked up.

1861
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:15,921
The pain is a cold feeling.

1862
01:37:19,991 --> 01:37:21,560
That's my brother.

1863
01:37:27,866 --> 01:37:30,868
But I guess, in a way,
his death gave you something.

1864
01:37:32,069 --> 01:37:34,439
His death gave you
something too.

1865
01:37:34,473 --> 01:37:35,908
It taught me a lot.

1866
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:38,010
It gave me
a better understanding

1867
01:37:38,042 --> 01:37:40,845
of my self-destruction,

1868
01:37:40,878 --> 01:37:45,050
what I was doing
to other people.

1869
01:37:45,082 --> 01:37:46,617
I know there's somebody
right now

1870
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:49,087
and they feeling the same way
about their brother.

1871
01:37:49,121 --> 01:37:50,889
You know what I'm saying?

1872
01:37:50,921 --> 01:37:54,826
And you know, I can't do nothing
but apologize

1873
01:37:54,859 --> 01:37:57,729
for the way I lived,

1874
01:37:57,762 --> 01:37:58,906
and I'm trying
to make it better.

1875
01:37:58,930 --> 01:38:02,067
I'm trying to help people.

1876
01:38:16,648 --> 01:38:19,518
Karma's a motherfucker.

1877
01:38:19,551 --> 01:38:22,621
And he's paying for it.

1878
01:38:22,653 --> 01:38:23,921
If you ever been to prison,

1879
01:38:23,954 --> 01:38:25,591
you ain't got nothing
but time to think,

1880
01:38:25,623 --> 01:38:27,592
especially when you're sitting
in that damn cell.

1881
01:38:27,626 --> 01:38:31,764
You gonna think about every one
of those guys that's dead.

1882
01:38:31,796 --> 01:38:34,732
Your Big B's,
your Herons, your Hen Dogs,

1883
01:38:34,765 --> 01:38:37,635
your Chias, your Buntrys.

1884
01:38:37,668 --> 01:38:39,570
You're gonna think about
all of these guys

1885
01:38:39,604 --> 01:38:41,673
that lost their lives.

1886
01:38:50,148 --> 01:38:54,819
People felt freer to talk once
Suge commenced his sentence.

1887
01:38:54,853 --> 01:38:58,524
Many of the people who witnessed
Biggie's killing that night

1888
01:38:58,556 --> 01:39:00,958
have kept a secret for 24 years.

1889
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:03,095
I didn't wanna do interviews
for years.

1890
01:39:03,127 --> 01:39:04,896
It was dangerous.

1891
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:06,999
It's dangerous to know anything.

1892
01:39:16,707 --> 01:39:20,112
I was there that night
Biggie got killed,

1893
01:39:20,144 --> 01:39:23,581
and so were some of the LAPD
officers we talked about.

1894
01:39:25,684 --> 01:39:30,055
I would put money on LAPD's
involvement, you know?

1895
01:39:30,087 --> 01:39:31,989
They're all not on
the force anymore,

1896
01:39:32,023 --> 01:39:34,159
so I guess it doesn't matter,
but...

1897
01:39:34,192 --> 01:39:38,096
Did you see David Mack
and Perez

1898
01:39:38,128 --> 01:39:39,931
at the event
at the Petersen Motor...

1899
01:39:39,965 --> 01:39:41,766
They were all there.

1900
01:39:44,769 --> 01:39:46,472
Yes, they were there.

1901
01:39:46,505 --> 01:39:49,641
'Cause the LAPD now have sort of

1902
01:39:49,674 --> 01:39:51,909
come up with
a whole other theory.

1903
01:39:51,943 --> 01:39:54,780
Mmm, outside of the police?

1904
01:39:54,813 --> 01:39:56,148
- Yeah.
- I'm sure they did.

1905
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:57,648
What's their theory?

1906
01:39:57,681 --> 01:40:01,586
That a gang member
called Poochie

1907
01:40:01,619 --> 01:40:05,189
shot and killed Biggie.

1908
01:40:05,223 --> 01:40:08,060
You know, really it doesn't
matter who pulled the trigger,

1909
01:40:08,092 --> 01:40:10,895
although I wouldn't
agree with that,

1910
01:40:10,929 --> 01:40:12,898
but what I would say is

1911
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:17,101
any gang member that was
to shoot or kill Biggie

1912
01:40:17,135 --> 01:40:19,771
could have only done so

1913
01:40:19,804 --> 01:40:22,207
with police involvement
and support.

1914
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:23,908
It would have been impossible.

1915
01:40:23,942 --> 01:40:26,278
They were everywhere.

1916
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:29,180
It was...
you don't have an event

1917
01:40:29,213 --> 01:40:32,050
that's a party after
the Soul Train Awards,

1918
01:40:32,082 --> 01:40:35,186
and especially in LA and
there's that many Black people,

1919
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:37,021
and you think the police
aren't everywhere?

1920
01:40:37,055 --> 01:40:38,223
They're everywhere.

1921
01:40:38,256 --> 01:40:39,858
Didn't work that way.

1922
01:40:39,890 --> 01:40:44,128
So there has to be compliance.

1923
01:40:44,162 --> 01:40:47,799
They were, they were complicit
in everything that happened

1924
01:40:47,832 --> 01:40:51,570
that had to do with Death Row.

1925
01:40:51,603 --> 01:40:55,107
I hold the police department
responsible for so much.

1926
01:41:06,150 --> 01:41:07,552
Word up.

1927
01:41:07,586 --> 01:41:08,820
- Ready, n♪♪♪♪?
- Yeah.

1928
01:41:08,853 --> 01:41:10,822
Ready for that
raw dog shit, n♪♪♪♪?

1929
01:41:11,989 --> 01:41:14,126
Okay, all right.

1930
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:16,161
Let me see how
my head should win.

1931
01:41:16,193 --> 01:41:17,728
You want to set it off?

1932
01:41:17,761 --> 01:41:19,898
Man, I'm scared to do
some freestyle.

1933
01:41:36,348 --> 01:41:37,582
Biggie didn't give a fuck.

1934
01:41:37,616 --> 01:41:39,751
Tupac didn't give a fuck.

1935
01:41:39,783 --> 01:41:43,087
It's fucked up that
the cause of their deaths

1936
01:41:43,121 --> 01:41:45,724
is behind the pettiest shit
on the planet.

1937
01:41:55,934 --> 01:41:57,034
They were buddy-buddies.

1938
01:41:57,068 --> 01:41:59,838
They were,
they were street buddies.

1939
01:41:59,871 --> 01:42:02,373
At the time of Tupac's death,

1940
01:42:02,407 --> 01:42:04,676
I think they were still buddies,

1941
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:08,813
because when I told my son
that Tupac died,

1942
01:42:08,846 --> 01:42:10,881
I could see the pain
in his eyes.

1943
01:42:14,818 --> 01:42:17,154
It sometimes brings me to tears

1944
01:42:17,188 --> 01:42:19,324
just thinking about
what could have been.

1945
01:42:19,357 --> 01:42:23,761
Where would we be right now
if they both were alive?

1946
01:42:23,795 --> 01:42:25,364
The world lost someone

1947
01:42:25,396 --> 01:42:29,033
that could have made
quite a difference.

1948
01:42:34,104 --> 01:42:36,707
Hey, that's what
I'm talking about.
