Toei Company, LTD. Presents

00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,816
TEHRAN

3
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,386
Whose agent are you?

4
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,893
Damn you!

5
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,649
Make him talk.

6
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,207
He's dead.

7
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,960
He bit off his own tongue.

8
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,841
Do you know this man?

9
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,176
Yes. I do.

10
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,511
Thanks.

11
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:22,558
Mr. Evans' suitcase.

12
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,897
Mr. Evans hasn't been back since July 5th.

13
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,192
He hasn't paid his hotel bill for a week.

14
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,078
BEIRUT

15
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,639
The manager of the hotel told me...

16
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,893
Evans has been missing since July 5th.

17
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,063
A maid said he was charmed by the moon.

18
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:12,399
And flew out of the window.

19
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,153
Where did he go?

20
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,404
To the moon?

21
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,033
Probably someplace a lot lower.

22
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,370
Maybe under the desert soil.

23
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,288
Damn luck!

24
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,084
Taylor, McGuire, Casey. Now Evans.

25
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,337
Four men! We lost four men already!

26
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,507
Evans was also wiped out?

27
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,554
The only way is for me to go to Tehran.

28
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:46,058
You don't have to go there.

29
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:49,019
You and your men are given leave.

30
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:50,562
Then our country...

31
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:53,399
We'll stop trying to catch Max Boa.

32
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,403
Meaning we must overlook Max Boa?

33
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,281
We've looked for him all over the world.

34
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,537
We know he's in Iran now.

35
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,541
This is our best chance to get him.

36
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,919
But we won't be able to get him in Iran.

37
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,881
It'd be infringement of sovereignty.

38
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,885
Iran has signed the extradition pact.

39
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,887
Arresting him is lawful.

40
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:27,349
Our nationality is different from his.

41
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:33,605
If we demand delivery, the police
from his country will cut in.

42
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,650
They'll just send him home.

43
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:41,155
He'll be released without a trial.

44
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,200
He has influence over his government.

45
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,786
You know that

46
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,999
Then why did you let four men die in vain?

47
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,959
Their deaths weren't in vain.

48
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,045
I'll avenge them.

49
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,965
How? We have no way to.

50
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,093
We'll kill Max Boa.

51
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:14,396

OCCUPATION: SNIPER

63
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,874
Five minutes to go. You sure he'll come?

64
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,586
He said he would. He'll be here any minute.

65
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,721
Golgo 13.

66
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:17,644
The name was given to him by fellow
inmates in a German prison.

67
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,776
It means the 13th man.

68
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,278
Judas - the one who betrayed Christ...

69
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,531
And helped crucify him on Golgotha Hill

70
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,116
Stop talking!

71
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,162
I've heard enough.

72
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,833
I'll have to be with him for a long time.

73
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,554
Excuse me.

74
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,101
You're wrong. We didn't order anything.

75
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,940
Someone is called for a pitcher
of water and glass.

76
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,240
This is Room 612.

77
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,703
We didn't Ã®rder anything.
You might be wrong.

78
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:16,954
What's up?

79
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,084
The operator said she was asked to
call this room at 10 o'clock.

80
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,252
By whom?

81
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:24,670
That'll be enough.

82
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,050
Tell the operator to forget it.

83
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,350
Put it down there.

84
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,490
You called me, didn't you?

85
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,868
Duke Togo!

86
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:01,582
You let the waiter enter and sneaked
in while we were on the phone.

87
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,500
Don't you trust a client?

88
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,585
Stop talking!

89
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,466
Pleased to meet you. I'm Richard Flanagan.

90
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,599
Hey! You're rude!

91
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:26,231
Don't mind. He doesn't like his
right hand grabbed by anyone.

92
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,569
I want you to explain.

93
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,112
Catherine.

94
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,621
Now that I see you, I'm convinced
you'll succeed in this job.

95
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,542
This is a hard job. Your target is Max Boa.

96
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,339
He has secret hideouts all over the world.

97
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,926
We've been informed he's now in Iran.

98
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:58,639
There are many contacts in code
between his country and Iran.

99
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,934
So I'm sure Boa is now in Iran.

100
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,646
Nobody knows his real face.

101
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,315
Several men bear his name.

102
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,368
Maybe none of them are Max Boa.

103
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:24,248
They say he was born in either
Berlin, Canada or Spain.

104
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,127
I don't think 'Boa' is his real name.
It means snake.

105
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:35,092
He's a shipping agent registered in
a South American country.

106
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:44,059
But actually, he's smuggling drugs
and weapons using his ships.

107
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,397
He's the biggest of their gangs.

108
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,191
There have been recent changes
in their movements.

109
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,568
Wherever they operate

110
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,111
beautiful girls disappear.

111
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:58,032
200 Europeans. 300 South Americans
and Indians.

112
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:01,702
And 65 girls missing from my country.

113
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,914
My daughter's one of them.

114
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,593
Keep quiet while I read this.

115
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,639
I'm sorry. Take time to read it.

116
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,413
When you've examined it...

117
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:50,584
you'll know why we're leaving
Max Boa to you.

118
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,588
We can't reach him.

119
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,882
Only a hired assassin can.

120
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,472
Wait! Calm down, will you?

121
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,600
I'll explain. Hamil was careless.

122
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,020
He hates a man to stand behind him.

123
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,649
Amazing! He prepared water for this.

124
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,793
Will you accept our offer?

125
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,131
I want to know your identity.

126
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:41,385
Sorry, but I can't tell you that.

127
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,431
If the truth is exposed...

128
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,102
Wait a minute.

129
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,940
I was wrong.

130
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,444
If our plan to kill Max Boa is known...

131
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,738
international trouble will happen.

132
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,158
I'm sure you won't reveal us

133
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,035
Look at this.

134
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,169
Seems all right.

135
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,504
Then will you please...?

136
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:23,344
Deposit half a million dollars
to a Swiss bank.

137
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,513
Thank you for accepting.

138
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,391
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot.

139
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,440
Use Miss Catherine Morton as your
assistant and contact.

140
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,567
Ask whatever you like.

141
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,278
Who is it?

142
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,530
Catherine.

143
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,545
I finished arrangements for going abroad.

144
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,757
Passports and plane tickets.

145
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,387
Why two tickets?

146
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:07,930
One for me.

147
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,975
I'll go with you. I'm your assistant.

148
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:19,316
I know Tehran. I went to Teheran University.

149
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,278
We're supposed to be a married couple.

150
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:28,200
It's Flanagans idea. So we
won't be discovered.

151
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,206
There's one more thing. I...

152
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,547
I was told to live the role of a wife.

153
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,072
You needn't do so.

154
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,116
Why not?

155
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:47,780
Embrace me.

156
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:58,415
If you don't love me, Golgo...

157
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,584
something may go wrong

158
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:10,339

162
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,298
I want to see Egbari. Contact him.

163
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,926
Tell him Duke Togo wants to see him.

164
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,689
Welcome. What can I do for you?

165
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,359
I'm Duke Togo. I have a reservation.

166
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:02,696
Yes, sir. We've kept a room
on the top floor.

167
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:07,242
You insisted it be near a fire exit.

168
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:09,411
Is there any reason?

169
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,955
It's an unusual order, sir.

170
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,459
There should be three boxes.

171
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,879
I see. I'll have them sent up at once.

172
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,512
Put them down there.

173
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,752
She's really beautiful.

174
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,100
She went to the police station.

175
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,638
Yes. Come in.

176
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,434
Am I bothering you?

177
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,728
You haven't been home for a week.

178
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,521
What's wrong?

179
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:10,157
I'm making a report about 20 missing women.

180
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:16,080
They disappeared in the past two weeks.

181
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,878
Their families didn't report it.

182
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,505
It's a mess.

183
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:26,632
Kidnapped for money?

184
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:27,591
Probably not.

185
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,429
I wish I knew.

186
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:34,139
I shouldn't have asked.

187
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,642
Don't mind. Come on, take a seat.

188
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,484
Let's eat out, Sheila.

189
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,403
You must be busy.

190
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:52,116
I'll forget you're my wife, if I stay
away from you for much longer.

191
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,411
I'll meet you at 8:00 PM.

192
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,621
I'll be at 'Paprika'.

193
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:59,164
Don't forget, darling.

194
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:53,010
Tell me the way to Hafiz Street.

195
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:57,598
Turn left at the second street.

196
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:59,892
At the second street?

197
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:06,190
Don't! Let go of me!

198
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,192
You!

199
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,805
Did you see who left this coat?

200
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:43,936
You didn't see the woman?

201
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:28,397
Found Max Boa's hideout?

202
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,357
Not a clue.

203
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:35,320
My assistant disappeared last night
and was found dead today.

204
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:38,699
He was in touch with a club manager.

205
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:44,580
What is his name, Egbari?

206
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:51,211
He's called 'Mr. Wine'
He's an underworld informer.

207
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:55,632
He's at the 'Club Scheherazade' every night.

208
00:27:58,178 --> 00:27:59,136
I see.

209
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,349
Thank you. Take this.

210
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:04,725
Thank you.

211
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:10,481
I'll try to find his hideout some other way.

212
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:12,066
Be careful.

213
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:17,112
I'll see you in your room tonight.

214
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:26,181
Egbari?

215
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:13,604
MAX BOA IS FOND OF LITTLE BIRDS

216
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:45,928
Thank you. I understand.

217
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:51,350
That'll be enough.

218
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:52,768
Shut up!

219
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,023
Quiet!

220
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:03,737
Search the hotels for an Asian man.

221
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:05,823
Look for him and find him!

222
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:52,953
How do you like it?

223
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,414
Wonderful, Mr. Wine.

224
00:31:57,751 --> 00:31:59,710
How did you know my name?

225
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:01,837
Who told you?

226
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,422
I'll pay one million.

227
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,425
Where's Max Boa?

228
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:25,736
Wait a minute.

229
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,654
I don't know where Boa is.

230
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:29,239
I'm not lying.

231
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:32,659
I'm telling you the truth.

232
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,245
His man has an office here.

233
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:38,248
His hideout is in the Old Town.

234
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:40,542
That's all I know.

235
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,962
Hello, this is Wine.

236
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:10,382
Thanks for remembering me.

237
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:12,801
I'm that Wine.

238
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:14,636
Business is so-so.

239
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:17,348
Listen, Mr. Walter.

240
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:20,309
I've got news concerning Mr. Boa's life.

241
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:24,063
Many men want to kill Mr. Boa.

242
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:27,149
Do you think you can get money for that?

243
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,403
The man in question isn't one
of these cheap guys.

244
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:35,616
Mr. Walter, I'm an expert in this business.

245
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:39,578
I know how much I can get for this info.

246
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:41,705
Okay, shoot!

247
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:45,084
Who's looking for Mr. Boa?

248
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:48,045
I want you to fix the sum first.

249
00:34:48,296 --> 00:34:51,465
The man is a trained killer.

250
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:55,135
Not enough. I want more.

251
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,307
All right, I agree.

252
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:03,435
The man is Asian, with...

253
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,108
What happened?

254
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:12,528
Hello? Hello?

255
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:37,029
How did you find me?

256
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:42,284
We have ways.

257
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:46,705
And you registered your real
name, Duke Togo.

258
00:37:32,877 --> 00:37:34,211
How about a drink?

259
00:37:35,714 --> 00:37:36,880
No, thanks.

260
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:42,177
Take a shower?

261
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:43,846
Later.

262
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:09,538
Am I nothing but a nuisance to you?

263
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,632
Is a woman just oil for a killing
machine like you?

264
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:29,475
You're turning your back on me.

265
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,269
You trust me, don't you?

266
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:34,229
You like me...

267
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:36,065
as a woman.

268
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,371
I'll take a shower.

269
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,027
You couldn't find him? I see.

270
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:26,865
An Asian man's staying at the
Sheraton Hotel.

271
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:37,501
Why don't you change?

272
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,838
My agent was murdered.

273
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,298
You must be careful.

274
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,513
Who is it?

275
00:39:52,851 --> 00:39:54,852
The police. Inspector Aman.

276
00:39:58,565 --> 00:40:00,566
Wait! I'm changing!

277
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:04,111
Open up! Or I'll break it down!

278
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:06,947
I said, wait!

279
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:08,449
What is this?

280
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:11,827
Stop it!

281
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:23,213
Dress and come with me.

282
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:25,257
Why? What did I do?

283
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,552
You helped a murderer escape.

284
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:38,354
What happened?

285
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:39,813
Shut up, you two!

286
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:45,361
Mr. Boa, the Asian, killed
Wine with a single shot.

287
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:48,697
I think I can get some dope on him.

288
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:53,660
I asked our people all over the
world to check it out.

289
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:00,793
All over the world? Isn't that a bit much?

290
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:03,295
Julie, what's wrong?

291
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:06,006
You have no appetite these days.

292
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:11,428
He's only a gunman. Is he worth
all that trouble?

293
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:15,307
Yes, if he's the man I'm thinking of.

294
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:22,481
Julie, the man must be dreadful,
because Walter's so frightened.

295
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:29,029
If  you're so frightened  I'll call
Simon and Douglas from Paris.

296
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:25,044
Who are you?

297
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:26,879
Is Walter in?

298
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:29,423
Don't act big. Say, 'Mr. Walter'

299
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:30,924
Simon!

300
00:42:34,095 --> 00:42:35,596
Is Mr Walter in?

301
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:41,060
A little search first.

302
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:43,062
Purely routine.

303
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:51,904
Net the lame big boy.

304
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:52,905
Calm down!

305
00:43:02,082 --> 00:43:03,707
Mr. Walter's room is upstairs.

306
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:04,833
Come...

307
00:43:05,251 --> 00:43:09,296
Wait! Don't you want to check
my artificial leg?

308
00:43:10,256 --> 00:43:14,218
What can you hide in your leg? What a clown.

309
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:22,184
What happened?

310
00:43:22,894 --> 00:43:28,315
One of your men made Simon angry
and was sent to the next world.

311
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:37,783
I didn't tell my men you two were coming.

312
00:43:38,993 --> 00:43:40,202
Sorry. It's my fault.

313
00:43:41,162 --> 00:43:43,163
Let bygones be bygones.

314
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:47,209
Did you learn the identity of the
man who opposes us?

315
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:50,963
I'll get the info we need tomorrow.

316
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:54,758
Then we'll decide what to do with him.

317
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:01,515
Do you think there are any killers
who want to fight three of us?

318
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:04,685
If he's the one I think he is...

319
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:07,771
He may try.

320
00:44:07,814 --> 00:44:09,106
What's his name?

321
00:44:09,858 --> 00:44:11,400
Can't say it now.

322
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:13,694
If I'm wrong you'll laugh.

323
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:16,196
I want you to wait till tomorrow.

324
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:22,661
I'll go to my place in the Old Town.

325
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:24,788
Make yourselves at home.

326
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:22,179
Open up!

327
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:45,452
Don't cry. Keep your chin up.

328
00:45:51,209 --> 00:45:52,418
How many?

329
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:54,128
Sixteen girls.

330
00:45:54,587 --> 00:45:56,171
What will you do with us?

331
00:45:56,214 --> 00:45:58,007
Let me go home, please.

332
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:04,430
Shut up! Keep silent!

333
00:46:06,516 --> 00:46:09,393
Let me go. I beg you.

334
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,959
How long do you intend to confine me?

335
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:43,130
I'm tired of hearing it.

336
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:45,841
Why did Duke Togo come here?

337
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,344
Tell me, then I'll free you.

338
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:51,555
We're on a honeymoon. Is that illegal?

339
00:48:51,681 --> 00:48:53,390
Don't lie!

340
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:56,518
He has the key to solve this case.

341
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:02,191
We caught one of the kidnappers.

342
00:49:08,782 --> 00:49:09,656
Is this the man?

343
00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:12,242
We killed one in the shooting.

344
00:49:14,996 --> 00:49:17,081
You'll have to talk.

345
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:32,197
Stop!

346
00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:37,828
Why did you kill the man?

347
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:44,752
I'll tell you if you let me see Boa.

348
00:50:45,003 --> 00:50:46,003
What?

349
00:50:49,674 --> 00:50:54,428
You deliberately killed him knowing
he wasn't really Boa?

350
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:59,058
Who ordered you to kill Boa?

351
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:01,226
Who are you?

352
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:07,358
Do what you like. Make him talk!

353
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:22,915
Where are the girls?

354
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:24,625
My wife's among them

355
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:26,001
Search me.

356
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:26,877
Talk!

357
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,254
Inspector, take it easy.

358
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,173
Don't interfere!

359
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:33,634
It's my responsibility.

360
00:51:33,885 --> 00:51:35,094
Let me handle this.

361
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:45,479
He's the toughest guys I've ever seen.

362
00:51:45,939 --> 00:51:47,856
What's he made of?

363
00:51:48,066 --> 00:51:52,695
He's only a man. If he's tortured
enough, he'll talk.

364
00:51:54,447 --> 00:51:56,824
You have a call from Isfahan.

365
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:19,263
Hello! This is Walter speaking.

366
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:21,890
Walter's on the phone.

367
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,109
Don't smoke near Julie.

368
00:52:32,402 --> 00:52:35,029
You know she hates smoke.

369
00:52:38,908 --> 00:52:43,537
You're a nice girl. Be considerate.

370
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:47,416
All right. It's nothing.

371
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,837
You're frightened. Yvonne is a bad girl.

372
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:56,133
Hello, Walter.

373
00:52:56,259 --> 00:53:00,554
You may know by now, but I've got a tip.

374
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:05,309
Two of your men were caught
by the Tehran police.

375
00:53:06,478 --> 00:53:08,145
Is that true, Mr. Boa?

376
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:10,356
Are you surprised, Walter?

377
00:53:11,232 --> 00:53:14,026
Then you must've become dull.

378
00:53:16,696 --> 00:53:21,492
The man in charge of the case is
Inspector Aman. Take care.

379
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,041
I'm sorry, sir.

380
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:34,463
Transfer the girls you're keeping
to the place we talked about.

381
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:38,384
It's time for you to go to bed, Julie.

382
00:53:38,468 --> 00:53:41,970
Sleep is most important for
your health. Come on.

383
00:54:17,716 --> 00:54:19,591
What shall we do with him?

384
00:54:20,343 --> 00:54:22,094
I'll kill him after he talks.

385
00:55:08,516 --> 00:55:09,308
Damn it!

386
00:55:24,616 --> 00:55:26,033
I'll go. You stay.

387
00:57:01,212 --> 00:57:04,715
The dark is favorable to a
blind man like me.

388
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:08,130
What's your name?

389
00:59:17,974 --> 00:59:19,433
Golgo 13.

390
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:26,732
Sure. Just as I thought.

391
00:59:41,414 --> 00:59:43,874
Who's your boss?

392
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:45,959
Max Boa.

393
00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:47,711
What?

394
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,634
Is he the boss? Where is he?

395
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:54,927
Isfahan.

396
00:59:54,969 --> 00:59:57,221
What part of Isfahan?

397
00:59:57,347 --> 00:59:59,932
Don't know. I've never seen him.

398
01:00:01,685 --> 01:00:03,394
What's Duke Togo to you?

399
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:11,318
Mrs. Togo, you're released. You may go.

400
01:00:11,986 --> 01:00:14,905
Your car is outside.

401
01:00:15,865 --> 01:00:17,449
Is that all?

402
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,205
What about my husband?

403
01:00:23,998 --> 01:00:27,126
He hasn't been reported dead.

404
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:31,130
When we find him, you'll
be the first to know.

405
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:32,881
Please go.

406
01:01:44,954 --> 01:01:48,874
ISFAHAN, 472km

407
01:03:21,468 --> 01:03:23,052
Why are you following me?

408
01:03:23,345 --> 01:03:25,471
I want to see my husband caught.

409
01:03:25,555 --> 01:03:28,182
You're under arrest for following me.

410
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:40,110
Suits me. Am I a hostage?

411
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:41,403
Get in.

412
01:04:59,315 --> 01:05:00,733
There! After him!

413
01:06:05,423 --> 01:06:06,382
Get him!

414
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:33,357
Don't shoot me! Golgo 13!

415
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,376
I'm the loser.

416
01:10:53,503 --> 01:10:55,713
I surrender. Spare me.

417
01:11:08,226 --> 01:11:11,770
I heard Golgo 13 wouldn't
shoot an unarmed man.

418
01:12:23,635 --> 01:12:25,928
HOTEL SHAH ABBAS

419
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:29,640
Don't move!

420
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:34,436
Stand with your hands up!

421
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:49,118
You're under arrest!

422
01:12:57,544 --> 01:12:58,585
Come with me.

423
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:01,755
Wait! He isn't one of Max Boa's men.

424
01:13:02,048 --> 01:13:02,840
Shut up!

425
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:06,343
The police will decide that.

426
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:11,765
He'll be tried for murder.

427
01:13:15,687 --> 01:13:19,440
Come on! Move!

428
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:42,463
Don't move!

429
01:13:43,381 --> 01:13:44,840
Or I'll shoot you.

430
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:55,184
If you don't trust me, I'll shoot you.

431
01:13:57,312 --> 01:13:59,271
Come on. Let's go.

432
01:14:19,042 --> 01:14:21,377
Damn slut!

433
01:14:23,171 --> 01:14:27,091
ISFAHAN

434
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:29,259
Where will you go?

435
01:14:30,762 --> 01:14:31,887
The Hotel Shah Abbas.

436
01:14:33,056 --> 01:14:35,849
You've found Max Boa at last, haven't you?

437
01:14:46,736 --> 01:14:47,653
What's up?

438
01:14:50,115 --> 01:14:51,407
Get out, will you?

439
01:14:51,866 --> 01:14:53,617
Let me go with you.

440
01:14:54,494 --> 01:14:55,411
No dice.

441
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:59,581
This is my job. I want you out.

442
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:12,386
You may think I'm sentimental.

443
01:15:13,138 --> 01:15:16,515
I missed you the days you were gone.

444
01:15:29,821 --> 01:15:31,947
You transferred the girls?

445
01:15:32,824 --> 01:15:34,616
Be careful of the police.

446
01:15:39,664 --> 01:15:41,623
What will you do with the girls?

447
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:45,044
Shut up! Don't meddle in my business.

448
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:54,553
Come in.

449
01:15:56,848 --> 01:15:58,640
Julie, there's trouble.

450
01:15:58,683 --> 01:16:01,268
Mr. Boa, Simon was killed by him.

451
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:03,604
Is his name Golgo 13?

452
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:07,524
He's a man to be feared.

453
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:10,861
She's right, Julie.

454
01:16:11,029 --> 01:16:14,990
He's frightening. His name alone thrills me.

455
01:16:15,742 --> 01:16:17,076
When will he come?

456
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:19,995
I don't think he's spotted this place.

457
01:16:20,246 --> 01:16:21,747
You don't think?

458
01:16:21,873 --> 01:16:23,874
Use your head, Douglas.

459
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:27,878
A man like Golgo should've found this place.

460
01:16:29,214 --> 01:16:30,506
I'm scared.

461
01:16:32,884 --> 01:16:35,511
Julie, let's have some tea on the terrace.

462
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,846
Golgo's trying to kill you.

463
01:16:38,056 --> 01:16:39,264
The terrace is risky.

464
01:16:39,391 --> 01:16:41,767
Don't tell me what to do.

465
01:16:41,893 --> 01:16:44,895
You know I don't like changes in schedule.

466
01:18:54,359 --> 01:18:56,694
Golgo's up there! The tower!

467
01:19:13,253 --> 01:19:15,087
He's gone. After him!

468
01:19:24,681 --> 01:19:26,515
Golgo, run!

469
01:19:37,444 --> 01:19:39,695
Golgo, what are you doing?

470
01:19:46,453 --> 01:19:48,078
Take the woman alive!

471
01:19:54,753 --> 01:19:55,627
After her!

472
01:19:59,174 --> 01:20:00,007
Hurry!

473
01:20:41,966 --> 01:20:43,592
You did a fine job.

474
01:20:45,762 --> 01:20:47,471
Take her away!

475
01:21:13,289 --> 01:21:14,289
Drive slowly.

476
01:21:14,374 --> 01:21:16,667
Golgo will shoot us.

477
01:21:17,043 --> 01:21:20,129
These windows are bullet-proof.

478
01:21:22,841 --> 01:21:24,758
I want him to follow us.

479
01:21:24,843 --> 01:21:27,344
To a hill like Golgotha where he's to die.

480
01:21:27,429 --> 01:21:29,096
Wait and see.

481
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:38,731
Only one dead?

482
01:21:41,151 --> 01:21:42,943
Find the Oriental!

483
01:21:56,541 --> 01:21:57,666
It's him!

484
01:22:02,464 --> 01:22:03,297
Ã squad.

485
01:22:03,548 --> 01:22:04,757
Get Inspector Aman.

486
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:09,428
Aman here. You found the Oriental?

487
01:22:10,055 --> 01:22:11,472
Heading for Persepolis?

488
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:27,381
Julie, you'll soon see a very
thrilling scene.

489
01:23:46,609 --> 01:23:50,446
Golgo 13, I know where you are!

490
01:23:51,114 --> 01:23:54,616
Come out, Golgo 13!

491
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:13,844
What are you doing?
Come out!

492
01:24:14,012 --> 01:24:17,181
If you don't, we'll kill the
girls one by one.

493
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:19,808
Golgo, don't come out! Forget me!

494
01:24:30,403 --> 01:24:33,155
What's up, Golgo? Are you scared?

495
01:24:34,699 --> 01:24:38,786
Golgo 13, where's your pride as a killer?

496
01:24:41,289 --> 01:24:45,793
Golgo 13, come out and fight with me.

497
01:24:54,886 --> 01:24:56,679
You're Golgo, eh?

498
01:24:59,015 --> 01:25:02,726
Listen! I'll give you one minute.

499
01:25:08,566 --> 01:25:10,567
Golgo, don't come out!

500
01:25:10,902 --> 01:25:12,569
Shut up, slut!

501
01:25:17,242 --> 01:25:18,701
They're your target?

502
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:25,791
Golgo, I'll count to ten!
I won't wait any longer!

503
01:25:25,917 --> 01:25:28,836
If you don't come out, I'll kill them!

504
01:25:40,557 --> 01:25:41,557
Don't go!

505
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,142
Why stop me?

506
01:25:47,939 --> 01:25:49,398
Don't die in vain.

507
01:25:53,486 --> 01:25:56,155
This is Inspector Aman!

508
01:25:56,197 --> 01:25:58,407
You're surrounded!

509
01:26:00,702 --> 01:26:03,996
Throw down your weapons and surrender!

510
01:26:07,167 --> 01:26:08,167
Give up!

511
01:26:08,668 --> 01:26:11,795
If you kill the girls,
we'll kill all of you!

512
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:16,842
There's an added attraction.

513
01:26:20,513 --> 01:26:21,555
Give up.

514
01:26:36,613 --> 01:26:37,613
Darling!

515
01:26:39,115 --> 01:26:40,199
Sheila!

516
01:26:43,161 --> 01:26:45,079
We don't need the police.

517
01:26:45,121 --> 01:26:47,915
Golgo, come out!

518
01:27:02,055 --> 01:27:03,055
Aman!

519
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,646
Golgo, don't care about me!

520
01:27:38,008 --> 01:27:41,885
Aman! Come and help! Hurry!

521
01:27:42,137 --> 01:27:45,889
Golgo! Your woman is next!

522
01:27:46,725 --> 01:27:51,395
Golgo! I'll shoot her at the
count of five this time!

523
01:27:58,695 --> 01:28:01,155
Isn't this amusing, Yvonne?

524
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:04,366
This is the greatest show.

525
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:07,786
If you count, you'll get nothing.

526
01:28:08,621 --> 01:28:12,666
Golgo will never come out. Go on! Kill me!

527
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:13,876
Hurry!

528
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:37,232
Golgo! I love you!

529
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:56,960
Beasts! I'll hang them all!

530
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,886
Come back, Douglas!

531
01:29:06,971 --> 01:29:08,806
He won't fall into your trap.

532
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:10,724
He's looking for me.

533
01:29:10,809 --> 01:29:12,518
That's enough. Come back!

534
01:29:14,229 --> 01:29:15,354
Let's go back!

535
01:29:43,299 --> 01:29:45,175
Take these girls with you! Hurry!

536
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:38,979
What do you want to say?

537
01:30:39,898 --> 01:30:41,565
Ask Golgo...

538
01:30:41,816 --> 01:30:47,905
to kill Max Boa... to kill Max Boa.

539
01:32:11,406 --> 01:32:15,868
Douglas! Golgo is coming!

540
01:32:25,879 --> 01:32:29,840
I'll get rid of him.
Please go back, Mr. Boa.

541
01:34:51,524 --> 01:34:54,443
Mr. Boa, I killed Golgo 13.

542
01:43:51,314 --> 01:43:55,150
The End
