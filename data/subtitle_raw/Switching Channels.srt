1
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:42,486
This is Christy Colleran
for Satellite News Network
here in downtown Chicago,

2
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:48,128
covering stories
the world over
24 hours a day.

3
00:00:47,028 --> 00:00:49,320
Here he comes.

4
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,767
CAMERAMAN: Rolling.

5
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:54,106
State's Attorney Roy Ridnitz
today announced that he would
challenge Governor Holt

6
00:00:54,106 --> 00:00:56,200
in the upcoming
Democratic primary.

7
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,464
It's a matter
of public record

8
00:00:57,464 --> 00:01:01,158
that these two men
haven't agreed on
almost any issue.

9
00:01:01,158 --> 00:01:07,044
The campaign promises to be
a good old Chicago dogfight.

10
00:01:07,044 --> 00:01:09,504
Yeah!

11
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:14,359
It's over, ma'am.
We got him.

12
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,490
The captain
just informed me

13
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,811
the police have finally
captured the infamous
Southside sniper.

14
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:23,373
(GUNSHOT)

15
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:26,398
We'll keep you informed.

16
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,422
Here you go, Christy.

17
00:01:30,422 --> 00:01:33,049
It may look like rain
to the rest of you,

18
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:37,207
but on Lake Shore Drive
it's sunshine all the way.

19
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:39,336
Aah! That's right, Chicago!

20
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:41,131
Hit me! Beat me!
I love it!

21
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:46,419
This is Christy Colleran,
Satellite Network News.

22
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:56,762
MAN: Five, four,
three, two, one. Hit it!

23
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:57,426
It's 4:00 a.m.,

24
00:01:57,426 --> 00:02:03,080
and here are
the fast-breaking stories
from around the world.

25
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:11,760
Today is a red-letter day
for the Chicago county jail.

26
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,417
Three hours after
the State Supreme Court
upheld the death sentence

27
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:18,810
of convicted cop killer
Ike Roscoe,

28
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,269
the authorities started
dusting off this old chair.

29
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:25,860
Chicago's first electrocution
in 27 years

30
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,687
is scheduled for July 15th
at midnight.

31
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:33,210
This man is
soft on crime.

32
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,308
He's soft
on the Soviets.

33
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:37,367
He's absolutely limp
on a voluntary
drug-testing system...

34
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,895
Limp? How can you
be limp on that?

35
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:43,953
Governor, please.

36
00:02:43,953 --> 00:02:46,645
Gentlemen!

37
00:02:46,645 --> 00:02:47,909
We're out of time.

38
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,269
I hate the Russians
as much as you.

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,611
Shit! Let's go.

40
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:06,635
So

41
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:09,892
that's what it's like
to roll a car

42
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:12,586
at the Cicero
stock car racetrack.

43
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:18,273
For SNN News,
this is Christy...

44
00:03:18,273 --> 00:03:20,634
Christy...

45
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:23,760
What the hell
is my last name?

46
00:03:27,751 --> 00:03:28,250
This just in.

47
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,207
At 12:00 noon today,
15,000 students
from all 50 states

48
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:33,904
will be joined
electronically

49
00:03:33,904 --> 00:03:37,861
to play
Darktown Strutters' Ball
on the kazoo

50
00:03:37,861 --> 00:03:39,592
for the President
of the United States.

51
00:03:39,592 --> 00:03:43,714
(VOICE CRACKING)
The President is
a former kazoo player

52
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:47,073
and may wish to join in.

53
00:03:47,073 --> 00:03:49,733
Hey, wait a minute!

54
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:53,789
We're doing a story
about 15,000 kazoo players

55
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:57,150
and the President
of the United States?

56
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,447
I can't believe...

57
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,675
I think my ex-wife
is cracking up.

58
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:03,602
What do you mean,
give her a vacation?

59
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:05,830
CHRISTY: Ha ha ha!

60
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,425
Give her a vacation.

61
00:04:08,425 --> 00:04:10,918
Ha-ha!

62
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:30,478
Miss.

63
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,396
Ah-choo!

64
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,671
Oh! It's the fresh air.

65
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:36,591
Thank you.

66
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:37,914
Christy Colleran.

67
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:39,884
Bienvenue, Madame Colleran.

68
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:42,464
Oh, no!
That's Miss Colleran.

69
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:44,468
Mademoiselle Colleran.

70
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:46,911
We have a double bed.
Is that okay?

71
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,831
I don't care
what size... Oh!

72
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,531
Uh...

73
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:55,671
I'm--I'm very sorry.

74
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,980
No problem.

75
00:05:01,102 --> 00:05:02,766
You were saying
s-something?

76
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:06,467
We have lots of things
here for you to do.

77
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:07,453
We have sailing.

78
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:11,492
Beautiful sailboats
for one or two.

79
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:21,133
Oh!

80
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:17,990
Need a lift?

81
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,577
Hi. Yes, please.

82
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:22,326
Hang on.

83
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:25,382
Here you go.
Grab my hand.

84
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:26,931
Aah!

85
00:06:29,987 --> 00:06:31,800
Hi.

86
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,186
Canoes are
kind of tricky, huh?

87
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:34,958
Yeah.

88
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:37,009
I'll get you a towel.

89
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,161
Oh!

90
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:40,805
There you go.

91
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:46,552
Um... Do you mind
if I do my own hair?

92
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:47,963
Sure.

93
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,953
Well, uh, I guess
I owe you one.

94
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:54,685
How about
if I take you
to dinner?

95
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:02,915
Just be sure you keep
your credit card
in your pocket.

96
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:10,073
So...

97
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:13,432
What do you do
when you're not pulling
women out of the lake?

98
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:16,357
I run a sporting
goods company
in New York.

99
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:21,194
We make tennis balls,
gym equipment and...

100
00:07:21,194 --> 00:07:22,237
Who cares?

101
00:07:22,237 --> 00:07:27,310
God, your hair
looks amazing
in the moonlight.

102
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,622
So does yours.

103
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,635
Thank you.

104
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:12,732
Thanks, Henry.
We'll just be a minute.

105
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:14,434
Yes, sir.

106
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:33,883
She's here, Sully.

107
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:35,651
Oh. I'm up.

108
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:45,760
Sully!

109
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,495
What?

110
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:50,798
They're taking him
to the jail right now!

111
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:51,632
Hi, Abby.

112
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:56,069
Christy! Welcome back.
How was your vacation?

113
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:56,869
Incredible.

114
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:01,908
I brought someone back.
I'd like you
to meet Mr. Bingham.

115
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,509
Hi.

116
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,109
Where's the ayatollah?

117
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,912
In the pit.

118
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:11,848
I'll just be
10 minutes, Blaine.

119
00:09:11,848 --> 00:09:12,818
Anything I can do to help?

120
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:17,954
I think after eight years
in a marriage,
I should tell him myself.

121
00:09:17,954 --> 00:09:19,790
I'll just be
10 minutes.

122
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:24,461
I can't handle
being away from you for 10.

123
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,970
I'll make it five.

124
00:09:41,007 --> 00:09:47,180
Uh, we haven't been apart
for the last...482 hours.

125
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,849
Yes, sir.

126
00:09:49,849 --> 00:09:50,783
Stand back!

127
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:54,585
Late show's broadcasting
all week from the Summit
in Belgium.

128
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:56,987
How many people
are you sending?

129
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:57,888
One.
One?

130
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,023
Nothing happens
at summits.

131
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:01,057
No one knows where
the hell Belgium is.

132
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:03,060
Right. Call
on line two.

133
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,094
Ludlow!

134
00:10:04,094 --> 00:10:05,928
Jesus, what an airhead!

135
00:10:05,928 --> 00:10:07,128
Sully!

136
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:07,997
Yeah.
Sully!

137
00:10:07,997 --> 00:10:10,967
Christy, get downtown.
They just moved Roscoe
from the pen to the jail.

138
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:13,536
Three weeks in Canada,
and this is my welcome?

139
00:10:13,536 --> 00:10:17,606
No! Welcome back!
Thank God you're back.

140
00:10:17,606 --> 00:10:19,708
Get down to the jail.

141
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:20,509
I can't.

142
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:23,709
This is the story
of the century!

143
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:27,548
I've got news
of my own.

144
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:29,148
MAN ON TV: Get back!

145
00:10:29,148 --> 00:10:30,649
The cameraman fell down!

146
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:34,086
We got a dog's
point of view!

147
00:10:34,586 --> 00:10:37,022
And so, with the clang
of the cell doors,

148
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:43,794
and the hiss of 120,000 volts
of Illinois power
less than 12 hours away...

149
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:44,596
Nice image, Ludlow.

150
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:47,965
...now being led
to his lonely,
private vigil...

151
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:49,832
What a Twinkie!

152
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:50,902
...waiting, perhaps eagerly,

153
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:54,603
for his own
personal death knell
and deliverance.

154
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:57,239
For Satellite News Network,
I'm Karen Ludlow.

155
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,575
Chicago county jail, Chicago.

156
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:01,876
Dear God!

157
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:05,780
Save me from reporters
that have read a book.

158
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,283
Missed you.
Nobody to fight with.

159
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:10,285
I've never been happier.

160
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:14,087
You romantics think
divorce is a passport
to happiness.

161
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:17,690
If you're unhappy,
why didn't you contest
the divorce?

162
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,126
Because you didn't ask
for a dime,

163
00:11:19,126 --> 00:11:22,995
and you accused me
of having an affair
with Margaret Thatcher.

164
00:11:22,995 --> 00:11:28,300
You're lucky I didn't claim
the war in Afghanistan.

165
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:31,701
We've had great stories,
haven't we?

166
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:33,905
That's your problem.

167
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:35,071
Everything's a story to you.

168
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:39,909
There's never been a story
more important to me than you.

169
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,979
On our first anniversary,

170
00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:45,949
you sent me to cover
the 10-second war
in Grenada.

171
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:48,350
Is it my fault
a volcano decided to erupt?

172
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,951
It's your fault
we had to go cover it.

173
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:54,120
We're in the news business.
You can't experience
lava indoors.

174
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,157
I'm quitting
the news business.

175
00:11:57,157 --> 00:12:01,294
You're always quitting
the news business.

176
00:12:01,294 --> 00:12:05,132
Why is there a fire
on channel four,
and we don't have it?

177
00:12:05,132 --> 00:12:06,332
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
What?

178
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:09,034
Breakfast, boss,
and 24-hour ratings.

179
00:12:09,034 --> 00:12:09,802
How are they?

180
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:12,171
They dropped two points,
but Christy's back now.

181
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:16,141
Oh. Ludlow's
not working out, huh?

182
00:12:17,342 --> 00:12:18,941
Yes, she's working out.

183
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,110
It's not her fault
the news is lousy.

184
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,180
Same healthy breakfast,
I see.

185
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,617
Why don't you relieve
Ludlow at the jail?

186
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:29,018
I told you
I'm quitting.
Yeah.

187
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:33,188
I'm tired
of space shuttles
and trips to Bhopal.

188
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:33,822
Sure.

189
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:38,860
I'd like a nice, normal,
relaxed kind of life.

190
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,831
Oh. One other thing.
I'm getting married.

191
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:49,135
I can't leave you alone
for a minute.

192
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:53,338
Boss, I got a tape
of that fire you wanted!

193
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:59,176
I thought you were happy
with the divorce.

194
00:13:03,647 --> 00:13:04,982
Who is he?

195
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:06,717
I met him
on vacation.

196
00:13:06,717 --> 00:13:08,685
He's not in
the news business.

197
00:13:08,685 --> 00:13:10,720
What are you
going to talk about?

198
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,889
Who needs to talk?
Yeah, right.

199
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,957
We're getting married
the day after tomorrow
in New York.

200
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:16,825
Jesus, why so soon?

201
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:20,862
I didn't feel like being
engaged for four years
and eight months again.

202
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:24,099
Blaine's
been married before.

203
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:25,133
What's his first name?

204
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:28,301
Blaine is his first name.
Blaine Bingham.

205
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:33,105
Blaine Bingham.
Blaine Bingham.

206
00:13:33,372 --> 00:13:35,676
Siegenthaler!
Is he rich?

207
00:13:35,676 --> 00:13:38,044
As a matter
of fact, yes.

208
00:13:38,044 --> 00:13:41,181
Siegenthaler,
kick satellite 11.

209
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:41,846
How rich?

210
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:44,282
Well, he owns his own
building in New York

211
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:49,053
and he's the country's
largest supplier
of athletic equipment.

212
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:50,421
Athletic equipment?

213
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:53,690
Bowling balls
and baseball mitts?

214
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,123
Well!

215
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:58,394
That should make
for very snappy pillow talk.

216
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:02,331
Ha ha ha!

217
00:14:07,703 --> 00:14:09,372
Again!

218
00:14:17,477 --> 00:14:18,945
Perfect.

219
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,779
Blaine is a wonderful man.

220
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:23,850
He is decent
and kind and caring.

221
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,452
Sounds like someone
I should marry.

222
00:14:25,452 --> 00:14:27,985
You're going to live
in an office building?

223
00:14:27,985 --> 00:14:30,723
No. He has an apartment
at the UN Plaza,

224
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:34,391
house in Oyster Bay,
condo in Nice...

225
00:14:34,391 --> 00:14:35,827
Ow!

226
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:36,929
Pinched nerve?

227
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,395
Yeah. Would you...

228
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:39,496
No.

229
00:14:39,496 --> 00:14:42,065
You're going
to become gracious,

230
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:45,767
have power din-dins
with the yuppies
from the firm.

231
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:46,802
And lots of babies.

232
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,437
I could have given you
all the babies you wanted.

233
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:52,274
I could have had them
without your help,

234
00:14:52,274 --> 00:14:57,846
aside from
your heavy chores
of conceiving.

235
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,347
Blaine wants
to nurture them.

236
00:14:59,347 --> 00:15:04,385
No, he doesn't.
He wants to make them
into angry little lawyers.

237
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:06,420
Roscoe's behind bars.
What about Ludlow?

238
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,023
Keep her there.
No food and no water.

239
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:13,391
This will be
a big story.

240
00:15:13,391 --> 00:15:14,893
Hmm.

241
00:15:14,893 --> 00:15:16,894
You're giving up
the news business

242
00:15:16,894 --> 00:15:19,064
to marry
a rowing-machine hustler?

243
00:15:19,064 --> 00:15:20,197
No, just reporting.

244
00:15:20,197 --> 00:15:24,033
I start as the new host
on AM Manhattan.

245
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:26,303
With the overweight
weatherman?

246
00:15:26,303 --> 00:15:27,804
And the afternoons off.

247
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:31,374
Interviewing entertainers,
dregs of the world.

248
00:15:31,374 --> 00:15:32,476
And a home life.

249
00:15:32,476 --> 00:15:35,009
Gonna have it all, huh?

250
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:36,779
Gonna try.

251
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,514
If you want
to move to New York
and raise little suits,

252
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:42,116
I'm for it 1,000%.

253
00:15:42,116 --> 00:15:44,552
You can fall in love
in three weeks.

254
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:46,319
Took us only two.

255
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:49,456
Was it that long
for you?

256
00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:53,426
Oh!

257
00:15:53,426 --> 00:15:54,460
Mmm!

258
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,363
I love it
when you're sincere.

259
00:15:56,363 --> 00:16:02,234
It's completely transparent,
but it's kind of charming.

260
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:04,336
Well, Sully,
I'll see you.

261
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:07,272
Why don't I take
you and Brains to lunch?

262
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:07,873
Blaine.

263
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:10,340
Blaine. Tell him
to meet us.

264
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,508
We're on our way
to the airport.

265
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:14,210
The little rascal's
out there,

266
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,446
and you wouldn't
let me meet him?

267
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:18,815
Afraid of the comparison?

268
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:21,584
After you.

269
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:24,153
They filed for bankruptcy?

270
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:25,286
Sir!

271
00:16:25,286 --> 00:16:26,989
Great!

272
00:16:26,989 --> 00:16:28,989
Guess what, Abigail.

273
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:29,390
Hmm?

274
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,493
My principal competition
just collapsed.

275
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:33,495
Oh?

276
00:16:33,495 --> 00:16:38,164
They got leveraged too high,
couldn't use a rollover,
so sharks got them.

277
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,432
Sign in, please, sir.

278
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,838
(WHISTLING)

279
00:16:48,973 --> 00:16:51,442
Bingham,
John L. Sullivan IV.

280
00:16:51,442 --> 00:16:53,078
(SPEAKING LOUDLY)
How are you?

281
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,414
I hear you're a terrific
racquetball player.

282
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:57,615
This is not him.

283
00:16:57,615 --> 00:17:01,117
No?
That's him.

284
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:08,389
Hi.

285
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:13,328
Ha-ha! Sorry.
She said the guy
with the tic.

286
00:17:13,328 --> 00:17:15,997
I've heard
a lot about you.

287
00:17:15,997 --> 00:17:19,466
Christy, Rinehart Brothers
just went belly up.

288
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:21,135
Blaine, that's wonderful!

289
00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:22,336
You own
this network?

290
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:24,638
No. He's a little guy,
looks like Hitler.

291
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:26,138
Sorry about
the hot weather, Bingham.

292
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:30,175
Glasses tied around your neck
in case a basketball game
breaks out?

293
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,378
You're marrying
a wonderful girl.

294
00:17:32,378 --> 00:17:33,112
Yes, I know.

295
00:17:33,112 --> 00:17:35,613
Don't let her reaction
to shellfish put you off.

296
00:17:35,613 --> 00:17:39,050
A lot of people swell up,
get blotches all over.

297
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,586
I used to take lotion
and put it everywhere.

298
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:44,387
Anyway,
don't worry about it.

299
00:17:44,387 --> 00:17:47,323
The scratching goes away
after a week or so.

300
00:17:47,323 --> 00:17:49,025
This girl has
a great mouth.

301
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:52,427
Blaine knows everything
about me, Sully.

302
00:17:52,427 --> 00:17:54,631
He does?

303
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:58,133
Even the, uh...

304
00:17:59,034 --> 00:18:01,602
Just kidding.
You're a lucky man.

305
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,604
I mean that
in all sincerity.

306
00:18:03,604 --> 00:18:07,507
Thanks. Know what she did
the third time we went out?

307
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:09,008
Do we ever.

308
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:10,310
Oh.

309
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:12,645
I wish you'd let me
take you two to lunch

310
00:18:12,645 --> 00:18:15,246
as a kind of hail
and farewell.

311
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:18,317
We've got reservations
on a 4:00 flight.

312
00:18:18,317 --> 00:18:20,285
Is the corporate jet down?

313
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:22,289
They're in Texas today.

314
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:23,922
Blaine, this is Chicago,

315
00:18:23,922 --> 00:18:25,189
"Hog butcher to the world."

316
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:27,557
Planes leaving every
hour to New York.

317
00:18:27,557 --> 00:18:33,195
It isn't often
a man meets the love
of his ex-wife's life.

318
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,364
Oh.

319
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:38,166
We were going to eat.
An hour wouldn't hurt.

320
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,003
Are you sure, darling?

321
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:41,137
Sure.
Sure.

322
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:43,004
Me Sully,
you darling.

323
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:45,140
Blaine, I love
that jacket.
Oh, thanks.

324
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,110
If the lapels were
a little wider, it would
almost be too post-retro.

325
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,112
Look great
with my jodhpurs.

326
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:55,049
Oh, you ride?
Only at night!

327
00:18:56,283 --> 00:18:58,451
What car are we taking?

328
00:18:58,451 --> 00:18:59,385
The Rolls.

329
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:01,087
Sullivan, I love your town.

330
00:19:01,087 --> 00:19:04,623
Did you know Chicago
means the smell
of wild onions?

331
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,625
New York just
means New York.

332
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,461
I left my computer.

333
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:10,661
I'll get it.

334
00:19:12,964 --> 00:19:13,531
Siegenthaler!

335
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:18,069
Book every seat on every
airline going to New York
in the next 24 hours.

336
00:19:18,069 --> 00:19:20,170
Sully, that'll take
all day.

337
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,437
Book the White Sox,
the Cubs,

338
00:19:21,437 --> 00:19:24,741
every employee at ABC News.
I'll be at the restaurant.

339
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:26,742
Then put me
on the election.

340
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:28,577
This makes
the election look

341
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:30,245
like the opening
of Al Capone's vault.

342
00:19:30,245 --> 00:19:36,417
I need someone with a strong
journalistic background...you!

343
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,752
Sully, I majored
in phys. ed.!

344
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:43,089
Perfect! You won't
run out of breath!

345
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:45,424
Sully, your table's ready.

346
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:47,527
Christy and I
will have the usual.

347
00:19:47,527 --> 00:19:48,626
Two shooters,
wild turkey.

348
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:53,467
A Perrier with lime,
and hold the ice.
I'll have to send out for it.

349
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:54,699
Watch this guy.

350
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:56,267
Yeah!

351
00:19:56,267 --> 00:19:59,068
Whew!
I love that fist.

352
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:01,138
Here you go, babe.

353
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:04,774
Joe, two shooters,
wild turkey!
Send out for a Perrier.

354
00:20:04,774 --> 00:20:05,575
Sorry.

355
00:20:05,575 --> 00:20:07,543
I thought you said
it was quiet.

356
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:10,113
It gets very quiet
between pitches.

357
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:10,779
So...
So...

358
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:13,282
So you two
are getting married?

359
00:20:13,282 --> 00:20:14,216
Uh-huh.
Yes.

360
00:20:14,216 --> 00:20:15,751
Have the results
of the blood test yet?

361
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:19,154
Is there something
you've forgotten to tell me?

362
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:20,255
He's right.

363
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:21,422
Over the last
couple of years,

364
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:25,793
I've had 16 pints
of my blood frozen
and stored, just in case.

365
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:28,427
My God, 16 pints?

366
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,764
Day after tomorrow,

367
00:20:30,764 --> 00:20:33,731
eight of those pints
are yours.

368
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:35,701
Aw.
I don't...

369
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,404
I think that's
so thoughtful of you.

370
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,606
What else have you got
saved up for a rainy day?

371
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:43,208
Sully, don't you think
that's enough?

372
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:48,279
The way you drink, maybe
he's got a spare liver
stored someplace.

373
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:53,216
Your Perrier's coming.

374
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:56,684
All right!

375
00:20:57,085 --> 00:20:58,821
MAN: Go!
Come on! Four!

376
00:20:58,821 --> 00:21:02,524
So you're what
a television newsman
looks like.

377
00:21:02,524 --> 00:21:04,392
And you sell
jockstraps.

378
00:21:04,392 --> 00:21:06,829
Seventeen million
worldwide this year alone.

379
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:10,432
If I'd invented
that little thing,
I'd be rich today.

380
00:21:10,432 --> 00:21:13,068
Aren't you rich?
A multimillionaire?

381
00:21:13,068 --> 00:21:15,402
What do you mean
by multi?

382
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:16,236
More than one.

383
00:21:16,236 --> 00:21:20,339
Blaine, don't discuss
our finances with him.

384
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:21,442
Our?
Our.

385
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:25,744
Sully!
Pastrami's good.
Chicken salad.

386
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:28,312
You do
anything grilled?
You name it.

387
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:32,149
A little piece of fresh fish,
mesquite-grilled.

388
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:34,784
Put sauteed baby vegetables
on the side.

389
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:36,252
What did he say?

390
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:41,390
Three specials
and a pitcher of beer.
Hearty, but light.

391
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,324
You got it.

392
00:21:42,324 --> 00:21:44,295
Blaine knows
everything about food.

393
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:47,496
That's important,
to know everything
about food.

394
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:51,233
Really.

395
00:21:53,134 --> 00:21:54,167
Sully.

396
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:56,104
Yo.

397
00:21:56,104 --> 00:21:56,536
Yeah?

398
00:21:56,536 --> 00:21:58,305
American and United,
booked.

399
00:21:58,305 --> 00:21:59,106
Working on TWA.

400
00:21:59,106 --> 00:22:02,876
Hell of a reporter.
She'll get the Peabody
this year.

401
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:04,877
Talking about Ludlow.

402
00:22:04,877 --> 00:22:08,147
What are you talking
about Ludlow for?

403
00:22:08,147 --> 00:22:10,483
She's doing
a great job.

404
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:11,217
Where is he?

405
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:13,451
She gets over
400 fan letters a week,

406
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:16,488
three proposals
of marriage.

407
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:18,723
I'll call back
6:00 New York time.

408
00:22:18,723 --> 00:22:21,191
Arrives this afternoon? Okay.

409
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:22,826
Fifty more.
Write it down.

410
00:22:22,826 --> 00:22:24,494
I'm doing
the best I can!

411
00:22:24,494 --> 00:22:27,663
Ludlow's filling
my shoes, huh?

412
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:28,331
Yes.

413
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:30,566
That Twinkie
couldn't fill my shoes

414
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:32,168
with an extra
pair of feet.

415
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:35,837
She's covering
Ike Roscoe's execution.

416
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:37,239
Who's Ike Roscoe?

417
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,707
BOTH: You don't know
who Ike Roscoe is?

418
00:22:38,707 --> 00:22:41,710
His picture's been
in the paper every day
the last three months.

419
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,877
He's not in
the financial section.

420
00:22:43,877 --> 00:22:47,481
He'll die for a crime
he should have committed.

421
00:22:47,481 --> 00:22:48,549
Should have committed?

422
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:50,818
Ike Roscoe's son died
of a drug overdose.

423
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:53,785
He shot the dealer,
who was a cop.

424
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:56,655
Here you are.
They don't like it here
when you kill a cop.

425
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:59,892
That cop was supplying
dope for over half
the high schools.

426
00:22:59,892 --> 00:23:02,259
The judge wouldn't allow
drug evidence

427
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:03,661
and sentenced Ike
to death.

428
00:23:03,661 --> 00:23:05,263
He dies tonight
at 12:01.

429
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:06,930
Can't the governor
pardon him?

430
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:10,368
He could,
but we're talking politics.

431
00:23:10,368 --> 00:23:11,402
Chicago politics.

432
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:13,269
In this town, rain
is a political deal.

433
00:23:13,269 --> 00:23:14,804
Besides, the state attorney
that got the conviction

434
00:23:14,804 --> 00:23:17,274
is running against
the governor. Excuse me.
Oh, yeah.

435
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:21,176
They're both trying
to out law-and-order
each other.

436
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:22,611
Can't something be done?

437
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:26,480
Yeah. I could
fire that hack Ludlow,

438
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,383
and your fiancee here

439
00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:30,717
could do
one last interview.

440
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:32,752
Maybe it would be
so touching

441
00:23:32,752 --> 00:23:35,421
that the governor
would change his mind.

442
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:36,289
Come off it, Sully.

443
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:40,226
It isn't fair to ask anyone
to postpone their wedding trip

444
00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:42,195
to save a man's life.

445
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:46,798
Could Christy interviewing
Ike Roscoe really change
the governor's mind?

446
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:48,233
Yeah!
Thousand to one.

447
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:49,366
Ten to one.

448
00:23:49,366 --> 00:23:51,302
Twelve to one.

449
00:23:51,302 --> 00:23:54,638
You've got to, honey.
We'll take a later plane.

450
00:23:54,638 --> 00:23:56,707
Don't you see
what he's doing?

451
00:23:56,707 --> 00:23:59,208
He doesn't care
about Ike!

452
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,843
He wants a hot lead
on the 6:00!

453
00:24:00,843 --> 00:24:05,615
If it means
it could save a man's life...

454
00:24:05,815 --> 00:24:08,283
Do you see
what I'm marrying?

455
00:24:08,283 --> 00:24:11,753
A decent human being.

456
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:14,921
It's a weird adjustment.

457
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:18,458
Do you really
want me to do it, darling?

458
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:19,526
Yes.
Yes.

459
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:21,894
I got to stop.
Me Sully. He darling.

460
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:25,730
I'd never
forgive myself
if you didn't try.

461
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,498
How long will it take?

462
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:31,502
Two hours. You'll be
on a plane by 7:00.

463
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:32,637
No problem.

464
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,770
Three specials!

465
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,541
Fresh from
the microwave.

466
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,474
Perrier's coming!

467
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:38,642
This is light?

468
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:40,645
Cottage cheese, see?

469
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:44,714
I'll do the interview
on one condition.
You got it.

470
00:24:44,714 --> 00:24:46,384
SNN needs a gym.

471
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:46,950
A what?

472
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,017
With the finest
Bingham equipment,

473
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:51,854
rowing machines,
bicycles...
Solarium, sauna.

474
00:24:51,854 --> 00:24:53,321
Exercise
is bad for you!

475
00:24:53,321 --> 00:24:56,724
More people die
from exercise
than from cancer.

476
00:24:56,724 --> 00:24:57,926
That's not true.

477
00:24:57,926 --> 00:24:58,860
Maybe I'm wrong.

478
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,794
Fill out
the order form.

479
00:25:00,794 --> 00:25:02,864
This could cost
over $100,000.

480
00:25:02,864 --> 00:25:03,797
Hundred and fifty.

481
00:25:03,797 --> 00:25:05,833
A man's life,
Sully, remember?

482
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:06,900
Do you give, uh...

483
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,570
Discounts?
Never.

484
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:12,639
Okay. Where do I sign?

485
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:14,308
Well, thank you
very much. Pleasure.

486
00:25:14,308 --> 00:25:18,643
Put down that sausage,
and get over to the jail!

487
00:25:18,876 --> 00:25:22,813
Christy, I'll meet
you at the office
in an hour.

488
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,348
Good to have you back.

489
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:26,650
Don't forget, Blaine,
he pays.

490
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,020
Okay. Have fun.

491
00:25:32,722 --> 00:25:35,825
(POLICE RADIO)

492
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,559
Jasper.

493
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,860
Christy,
how you doin'?

494
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,694
Fine.
What are
you up to?

495
00:25:39,694 --> 00:25:41,463
Here to see the warden.

496
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:43,299
Hey, Eddie.

497
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,069
I can't let you
interview him

498
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:50,336
when I've turned down
everyone else.

499
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,638
Yes, you can.

500
00:25:51,638 --> 00:25:53,005
Why?

501
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:55,975
I know about
those romantic visits

502
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:58,644
you arranged between prisoners
and their girlfriends

503
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:00,012
right in
your own office.

504
00:26:00,012 --> 00:26:02,447
Now, who told you
about that?

505
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:03,516
True, isn't it?

506
00:26:03,516 --> 00:26:05,650
You wouldn't understand,
being a girl.

507
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,786
A man needs
a little release.

508
00:26:07,786 --> 00:26:08,886
Profitable release.

509
00:26:08,886 --> 00:26:10,555
You charge inmates
200 bucks a visit.

510
00:26:10,555 --> 00:26:14,357
All right, now just a minute.
That makes you a
pimp or a madam.

511
00:26:14,357 --> 00:26:16,725
I'm not a pimp
or a madam!

512
00:26:16,725 --> 00:26:18,062
In that case,

513
00:26:18,062 --> 00:26:21,030
we can use this
on a new feature

514
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:25,801
we're doing on innovative
prison techniques tomorrow.

516
00:26:26,803 --> 00:26:29,603

to Ike Roscoe.

I want to order a gym
for Chicago right away.

519
00:26:41,848 --> 00:26:44,783
That'll be great.

520
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:46,718
Hmm?
The whole thing.

521
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:50,788
Yeah. We're
just closing now.
It's a killer deal.

522
00:26:50,788 --> 00:26:54,692
There's a pen
in my briefcase
if you need it.

523
00:26:56,027 --> 00:26:56,794
What?

524
00:26:56,794 --> 00:27:00,030
That's ridiculous!
They can't all be booked.

525
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,699
What's going on?

526
00:27:02,699 --> 00:27:03,532
Uh-huh.

527
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:06,837
That's okay.
No problem.
We'll go to Plan B.

528
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:09,371
Yeah. Christy is
going to love it.

529
00:27:09,371 --> 00:27:11,473
Wait till I tell her.

530
00:27:14,075 --> 00:27:16,411
Siegenthaler!

531
00:27:16,411 --> 00:27:17,844
Goodbye.

532
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:20,481
Have you booked
the, uh...

533
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:21,782
Bookings?

534
00:27:21,782 --> 00:27:23,851
Just finished.

535
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,018
My girls can't talk.

536
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,020
(HOARSE VOICE)
Can we go home?

537
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,954
(HOARSE VOICE)
Please! Please!

538
00:27:28,954 --> 00:27:30,991
God, you sound awful!

539
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:32,391
Thanks!

540
00:27:32,391 --> 00:27:33,960
Good work, kids.

541
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,695
Take the day off.

542
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:36,828
See ya.

543
00:27:36,828 --> 00:27:37,963
Bye.

544
00:27:37,963 --> 00:27:39,696
Okay? Thanks a lot.

545
00:27:39,696 --> 00:27:41,632
Every seat
on every flight

546
00:27:41,632 --> 00:27:44,402
from Chicago to New York
is booked the next 24 hours.

547
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:46,871
The garbage strike
must be over.

548
00:27:46,871 --> 00:27:47,771
Oh, thanks.

549
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:49,004
You'll leave
in the morning?

550
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:52,107
No. There's nothing
quite so romantic

551
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:54,110
as an overnight
train ride.

552
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:58,013
There's one tonight
at 11:00.

553
00:27:58,013 --> 00:27:59,047
Yeah.

554
00:27:59,047 --> 00:28:02,117
Beds are a little short,
but it's quaint.

555
00:28:02,117 --> 00:28:04,920
Be back in a minute.

556
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,855
Oh!
Don't move!

557
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:10,757
Book every ticket
on the train to New York

558
00:28:10,757 --> 00:28:12,625
for the next 24 hours!

559
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:13,459
Oh, is that all?

560
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:15,829
Boats, buses,
helicopters, too.

561
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:16,530
We can't!

562
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,830
The network's future
is at stake!

563
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,166
Get me the mail room.

564
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,967
We should buy
all the sneakers,

565
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:23,835
in case the guy
wants to jog
to New York.

566
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:29,040
I'm expecting
athletic equipment
from Bingham Industries.

567
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,110
Hit a couple
of exercise bikes
with a hammer

568
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,678
and ship the whole shebang
back as damaged goods.

569
00:28:35,678 --> 00:28:37,846
Whose names do we use now?
Streets!

570
00:28:37,846 --> 00:28:40,049
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

571
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:41,582
Yeah?

572
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:44,052
You did it, Christy!
I knew you could.

573
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:45,821
When are you
seeing him?

574
00:28:45,821 --> 00:28:49,723
Not so fast. No interview
till you sign the deal.

575
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:50,725
I signed it!

576
00:28:50,725 --> 00:28:52,158
I'd like to talk
to Blaine.

577
00:28:52,158 --> 00:28:54,895
BLAINE: Hi, darling,
are you having fun?

578
00:28:54,895 --> 00:28:56,931
Blaine,
did he sign it?

579
00:28:56,931 --> 00:28:57,797
Sure did.

580
00:28:57,797 --> 00:29:01,634
Not disappearing ink, is it?
He didn't date it 1888?

581
00:29:01,634 --> 00:29:02,168
No.

582
00:29:02,168 --> 00:29:03,635
No nicknames?
What do you mean?

583
00:29:03,635 --> 00:29:06,972
Once he signed
a reporter's contract
"Peter Rabbit."

584
00:29:06,972 --> 00:29:08,472
Ha ha!
Ha ha!

585
00:29:08,472 --> 00:29:10,742
No. It's all
completely legal, dear.

586
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:13,877
Sweetheart,
I do this every day.

587
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,178
Listen.

588
00:29:15,178 --> 00:29:16,681
Do you mind?

589
00:29:16,681 --> 00:29:18,649
Hmm?

590
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:19,149
Oh!

591
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:23,019
Darling, all the airlines
were booked,

592
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:26,721
but I've got us tickets
on the 11:00 train tonight.

593
00:29:26,721 --> 00:29:29,226
It'll be just like
North by Northwest.

594
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:31,025
You already got tickets?

595
00:29:31,025 --> 00:29:33,095
Yes.
You didn't tell me.

596
00:29:33,095 --> 00:29:36,530
I didn't think
you'd be that interested.

597
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:39,031
Siegenthaler, cancel
what I just said!

598
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:41,035
What? Sully, you...

599
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:42,869
Okay.

600
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:44,570
Bye-bye.

601
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:47,506
She's going to make
a great little wife,

602
00:29:47,506 --> 00:29:50,242
like another appendage,
an extra arm or leg.

603
00:29:50,242 --> 00:29:53,244
She's real concerned
about my business, too.

604
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:56,014
After tomorrow,
she'll have half of it

605
00:29:56,014 --> 00:29:57,683
and all that blood.

606
00:29:57,683 --> 00:29:59,584
Like community
property? No, no.

607
00:29:59,584 --> 00:30:01,952
Our relationship is
more profound than that.

608
00:30:01,952 --> 00:30:06,689
We've both made
horrible, agonizing
mistakes before.

609
00:30:06,689 --> 00:30:09,292
Sorry. No offense.

610
00:30:09,292 --> 00:30:11,094
We don't want
to do it again.

611
00:30:11,094 --> 00:30:13,662
But I love her
a staggering amount.

612
00:30:13,662 --> 00:30:15,663
Very unusual for me.

613
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:17,666
(WHISTLING)

614
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:22,871
You make me
very nostalgic for her.

615
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:26,240
We just had a very
physical relationship.

616
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,744
Juices intermingling...
You know.

617
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,577
Hardly ever talked.

618
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:33,878
Sex,

619
00:30:33,878 --> 00:30:35,214
sex...

620
00:30:39,984 --> 00:30:40,953
sex.

621
00:30:40,953 --> 00:30:43,754
I think she's happier
out of the cave.

622
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:44,321
Course she is!

623
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:49,726
You're right.
Marrying Christy will be
like having another leg.

624
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:52,830
Tell her that.
She'll love it!

625
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:53,697
I have got a great idea.

626
00:30:53,697 --> 00:30:55,731
I'm going to get a picnic
for the train.

627
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,868
Champagne, caviar,
silver candlesticks.

628
00:30:57,868 --> 00:30:59,569
We met
because of a candle.

629
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:02,036
Say, do you know
where I could get some?

630
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:03,905
Silver candlesticks?

631
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:05,340
Absolutely.

632
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,074
Great.

633
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,841
I know
a perfect place.

634
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:09,677
Siegenthaler,
I need you.

635
00:31:09,677 --> 00:31:11,245
You are really
a good sport.

636
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:12,680
Christy warned me
about you.

637
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,215
Said you'd be a lot
different, not so nice.

638
00:31:15,215 --> 00:31:16,951
I'm a hard guy to know.

639
00:31:16,951 --> 00:31:18,184
Yo!

640
00:31:18,184 --> 00:31:19,018
Where you been?

641
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:21,920
Take Mr. Bingham
to the silver store.

642
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,256
Where is one?

643
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,657
State of Illinois Tower.

644
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:27,125
The Tower has
a silver store?

645
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,826
That's the place.

646
00:31:28,826 --> 00:31:30,695
Siegenthaler,
I'm very busy.

647
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:33,863
Sullivan, did you
actually sign
a reporter's contract

648
00:31:33,863 --> 00:31:34,831
"Peter Rabbit"?

649
00:31:34,831 --> 00:31:37,133
Yes.
What did
the reporter do?

650
00:31:37,133 --> 00:31:39,369
Christy laughed her ass off.

651
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:41,271
Ha ha ha!

652
00:31:42,672 --> 00:31:46,008
Can I ask you
a question?

653
00:31:46,008 --> 00:31:46,642
Sure.

654
00:31:46,642 --> 00:31:48,310
It's slightly
personal.
It's okay.

655
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,112
Do you streak
your hair?

656
00:31:50,112 --> 00:31:52,947
Sure. Tried six
different colors.

657
00:31:52,947 --> 00:31:55,650
I had Burnished Peaches,
but it was brassy.

658
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,218
Now it's
Mellow Sun Tone.
I think it works.

659
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:00,353
Works for me.

660
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:02,222
Me, too.

661
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:03,689
Bye.

662
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:06,926
Bye, guys.
Happy shopping.

663
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,194
Abigail!

664
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:09,028
Sir?

665
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,629
If that dildo
comes back,

666
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,932
search every orifice
he has.

667
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,132
Yes, sir!

668
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,634
Hey, everybody!

669
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,770
Hey!
Hey!

670
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,972
Tell this guy,
if he delivers his ward,

671
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,406
he can be city sealer.

672
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:23,239
And his wife?

673
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:26,142
We'll put her in charge
of...a landmark.

674
00:32:26,142 --> 00:32:29,178
$75,000 a year
is easy for her.

675
00:32:29,178 --> 00:32:33,681
Oh. Oh, ho,
ho, yes.

676
00:32:33,681 --> 00:32:34,281
I love it.

677
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:37,351
Hey, everybody,
I love these!

678
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:38,820
(APPLAUSE)

679
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,154
If we carry
the election,

680
00:32:40,154 --> 00:32:42,957
I'll put
his whole family
in office.

681
00:32:42,957 --> 00:32:43,859
The baby, too?

682
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:46,192
In charge of
parking violations.

683
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:47,662
Mr. Ridnitz!

684
00:32:47,662 --> 00:32:49,329
What's so urgent?

685
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:50,263
It's Warden Terwilliger.

686
00:32:50,263 --> 00:32:53,199
What does he
want, anyway?

687
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:56,268
Hey, Twig!
How are ya?

688
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,973
You did what?

689
00:33:01,973 --> 00:33:05,142
(SIREN)

690
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:07,278
Hey, listen to me.

691
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:09,814
I spent two months
making sure

692
00:33:09,814 --> 00:33:12,380
that nobody got an interview
with Ike Roscoe.

693
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,185
Now you're telling me
that you gave one to that...

694
00:33:16,185 --> 00:33:21,391
Female reporter
on the night
of his execution?

695
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:25,294
I don't care what
she's got on you!

696
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,294
Call it off,

697
00:33:26,294 --> 00:33:30,830
or you will not
be the warden of...

698
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,932
Understand?

699
00:33:31,932 --> 00:33:35,868
Whatever you do, make sure
they don't catch you
on camera

700
00:33:35,868 --> 00:33:37,237
refusing to be interviewed.

701
00:33:37,237 --> 00:33:41,240
That's how Mike Wallace
got me last year.

702
00:33:42,874 --> 00:33:45,711
No! Stop them!

703
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:48,847
He's changed his mind.
Let's roll tape.

704
00:33:48,847 --> 00:33:50,849
We're rolling,
Terwilliger.

705
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:52,784
You're not trying
to prevent the public

706
00:33:52,784 --> 00:33:55,820
from hearing
the final words
of a condemned man,

707
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,820
are you, Warden?

708
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,958
No. I was...
Trying to make sure
you got in okay.

709
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,960
Thank you.
Let's go.

710
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,230
Are you sure about this?

711
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,033
This is a vicious killer...

712
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:12,134
(SLAM)

713
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:16,071
Driven absolutely mad
with rage.

714
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:34,520
Hello, Ike.

715
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,120
Hi, Miss Colleran.

716
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,991
Thank you
for giving me
this interview.

717
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:40,391
I'd do anything for you.

718
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:44,093
You're the only one
who's been decent to me

719
00:34:44,093 --> 00:34:45,797
except for Pamela.

720
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:49,165
Pamela Farbrother,
your lawyer?

721
00:34:49,165 --> 00:34:53,033
How are they
treating you here, Ike?

722
00:34:53,033 --> 00:34:54,069
I can't complain.

723
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:58,805
I mean, I never get to see
anybody but the guards,

724
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,043
but they're
pretty nice fellows.

725
00:35:02,778 --> 00:35:06,446
Would you share
your thoughts, Ike?

726
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,417
Now I know what it's like
to be without hope.

727
00:35:12,018 --> 00:35:14,920
All those months
I kept thinking,

728
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,956
"They're not going
to kill me."

729
00:35:17,956 --> 00:35:20,159
All I wanted
was my boy back,

730
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,295
but now I know
they are going to kill me.

731
00:35:25,962 --> 00:35:27,330
I know this is painful,

732
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:32,268
but would you go over
that horrible night
one more time?

733
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:37,006
Anthony was a quiet kid.

734
00:35:37,006 --> 00:35:39,040
He didn't have
many friends.

735
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,411
He wanted to be
in the newspaper business.

736
00:35:44,945 --> 00:35:46,949
What that man did
to him...

737
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:50,449
Needle marks along
his arm, inside his thigh.

738
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:56,087
He used to defecate in his bed.
That's what the drugs did.

739
00:35:56,087 --> 00:36:00,025
He became a dealer
to--to keep his habit going.

740
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:03,461
That's how I found out
the name of the supplier.

741
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,431
Edward Kisinski.

742
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,401
What happened then?

743
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,206
January 18th...

744
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,374
Please, Ike.
Go on if you can.

745
00:36:22,578 --> 00:36:24,479
On January 18th,

746
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:28,917
he--he went for a walk
completely zonked

747
00:36:28,917 --> 00:36:33,554
and just fell off
the bridge.

748
00:36:33,554 --> 00:36:38,558
I went downtown
to this shop off State Street

749
00:36:38,558 --> 00:36:40,093
and bought a .38 special.

750
00:36:40,093 --> 00:36:45,031
I went to Kisinski's house
and shot him over and over.

751
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:47,066
I ran out of bullets.

752
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:49,300
He was positively
the dealer?

753
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,868
I saw him sell Tony the stuff.

754
00:36:50,868 --> 00:36:54,240
I didn't know he was a cop,
but I'm not sorry.

755
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,177
He killed Tony and who knows
how many other kids.

756
00:36:59,477 --> 00:37:02,612
I--I did it for revenge
and nothing more.

757
00:37:02,612 --> 00:37:05,581
Maybe I'm getting
what I deserve.

758
00:37:05,581 --> 00:37:06,950
No. You're not.

759
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,952
You don't deserve
to be executed.

760
00:37:09,952 --> 00:37:12,555
I'm gonna be.

761
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:19,293
You know what today is?

762
00:37:19,293 --> 00:37:22,061
It's Houdini's birthday.

763
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:23,631
I used to practice tricks

764
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:27,034
when I was working
as a magician.

765
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,103
Anthony helped me with
the inverted water bottle.

766
00:37:31,103 --> 00:37:36,942
Is there a favorite trick
of Anthony's
you could do here?

767
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:42,247
It's just a pen.

768
00:37:54,323 --> 00:37:56,558
Very clever.

769
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:01,429
Terrific!

770
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:06,701
It's the simplest trick,
but it always fooled Tony.

771
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,136
Houdini would be proud.

772
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:13,106
Not even Houdini
could get out
of this place.

773
00:38:16,075 --> 00:38:19,178
That's it.
Thank you, Ike.

774
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:27,185
Come on, Ike.
Let's go.

775
00:38:32,357 --> 00:38:34,324
Thank you,
Miss Colleran.

776
00:38:34,324 --> 00:38:37,528
I'll do
everything I can.

777
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:46,668
Come on, boys.

778
00:38:46,668 --> 00:38:51,571
BLAINE: Some say it's
a monkey. Some say a poodle.

779
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:52,340
It's untitled,

780
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,376
but the contrast against
the vertical building
is really amazing.

781
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,044
I've got one
of those.

782
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,012
One of those?

783
00:38:59,012 --> 00:39:01,682
No. A couple paintings.

784
00:39:01,682 --> 00:39:02,514
It's a great town.

785
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:05,618
After New York,
Chicago is the best
in the country.

786
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:06,753
Yeah?

787
00:39:06,753 --> 00:39:07,753
Hello.

788
00:39:07,753 --> 00:39:10,155
Cute buns.

789
00:39:17,028 --> 00:39:20,297
There's no pen
in my pen.

790
00:39:31,073 --> 00:39:32,709
Hold it, Roscoe.

791
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:36,144
You know
the procedure.

792
00:39:36,144 --> 00:39:37,512
(SLAM)

793
00:39:39,148 --> 00:39:41,179
Okay. In you go.

794
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:48,121
Fred, you want
a coffee?

795
00:39:48,121 --> 00:39:50,157
Yeah. Okay.

796
00:39:50,157 --> 00:39:52,023
Anything on tonight?

797
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:53,058
I think the game's on.

798
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,195
All right.
What channel?

799
00:39:56,195 --> 00:39:57,495
Uh, two?

800
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,231
Uh...

801
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,503
Wow.

802
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,405
It's huge.

803
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,438
So, where's Covalof's?

804
00:40:09,438 --> 00:40:11,373
Seventeenth floor.

805
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:26,420
I can't go up there.

806
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,455
Okay. Tell you what.

807
00:40:27,455 --> 00:40:29,490
Let me give you
my American Express card.

808
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:34,127
Get two candlesticks
for under two grand.

809
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:35,495
I couldn't, Mr. Bingham.

810
00:40:35,495 --> 00:40:37,595
They check the signature
and the I.D.

811
00:40:37,595 --> 00:40:41,200
Don't you want
to pick it yourself?

812
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:44,134
Yeah. Yeah.

813
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,715
(WHISTLING)

814
00:41:00,149 --> 00:41:02,619
I can do it.
I can do it.

815
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:09,590
Aah!

816
00:41:10,391 --> 00:41:11,625
Stop it! Stop it!

817
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:14,195
Stop what?

818
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:16,563
Mr. Bingham.

819
00:41:16,563 --> 00:41:20,166
Please! Stop it!
Stop it!

820
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:22,469
What's the matter,
Mr. Bingham?

821
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:23,369
Uh! Uh!

822
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:25,338
Mr. Bingham,
are you okay?

823
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:27,140
Is there something...

824
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,738
Uh! Uh!

825
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,875
Don't touch that!
Don't! Don't!

826
00:41:29,875 --> 00:41:31,210
Ahh! Ahh!

827
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,679
Ahh! Ahh!
That's the emergency button,
Mr. Bingham.

828
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:34,680
(ALARM RINGS)

829
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,881
Mommy! Mommy!
Help me!

830
00:41:37,881 --> 00:41:39,749
Oh! Help me!

831
00:41:50,657 --> 00:41:53,462
Dichotomy.

832
00:41:53,462 --> 00:41:55,796
Egregious.

833
00:41:55,796 --> 00:41:57,533
Shit!

834
00:42:00,235 --> 00:42:01,635
So, Ludlow...

835
00:42:01,635 --> 00:42:02,703
Karen.

836
00:42:02,703 --> 00:42:04,538
Karen,

837
00:42:04,538 --> 00:42:07,572
welcome to TV news.

838
00:42:10,809 --> 00:42:14,679
What the hell
is she doing here?

839
00:42:17,315 --> 00:42:20,784
Come on, guys.
We got action.

840
00:42:20,784 --> 00:42:22,821
Colleran! Geez!

841
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:24,821
Come on, Bill.

842
00:42:25,723 --> 00:42:27,557
(CHANTING)

843
00:42:27,557 --> 00:42:28,626
Anybody got hamburger?

844
00:42:28,626 --> 00:42:31,495
The zoo's out,
and the pandas
are hungry.

845
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:32,827
Christy! Christy!

846
00:42:32,827 --> 00:42:34,264
What are you
doing here?

847
00:42:34,264 --> 00:42:37,166
The governor's going
to pardon Ike.
You're kidding!

848
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,800
He's going to juice
the DA instead.

849
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,836
Beautiful pun.

850
00:42:40,836 --> 00:42:41,936
Come on, Christy.

851
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:43,472
What were you doing?

852
00:42:43,472 --> 00:42:44,304
Hey, how are you?

853
00:42:44,304 --> 00:42:46,741
Weren't you
talking to Ike?
Did he say anything?

854
00:42:46,741 --> 00:42:47,507
Who?

855
00:42:47,507 --> 00:42:49,476
You don't win Emmys
for backstabbing.

856
00:42:49,476 --> 00:42:51,912
That's exactly how
you win Emmys.

857
00:42:51,912 --> 00:42:53,713
I'm through
with this business.

858
00:42:53,713 --> 00:42:56,448
You, through
with the business?
Bullshit!

859
00:42:56,448 --> 00:43:00,220
I'm off to the Big Apple
and a morning talk show.

860
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:00,819
An indoor job?

861
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:04,188
In two days, I will be
a happily married woman.

862
00:43:04,188 --> 00:43:06,324
I thought you
were happily married.

863
00:43:06,324 --> 00:43:08,726
Sully was
the miserable one!

864
00:43:08,726 --> 00:43:10,493
Zaks, that's almost
as funny

865
00:43:10,493 --> 00:43:14,931
as your series on
sexual harassment
in the supermarkets.

866
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:16,967
Low blow.
Nice shot.

867
00:43:16,967 --> 00:43:19,235
I've got a tag waiting.

868
00:43:19,235 --> 00:43:20,470
What's the tag?

869
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:23,306
Tune in at 6:00,
Tillinger.

870
00:43:23,306 --> 00:43:24,640
She hasn't got anything.

871
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,541
All talk.
She didn't see him.

872
00:43:26,541 --> 00:43:29,978
I'm going back
to the truck.
Yeah, me, too.

873
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:36,217
Whatever she tells me,
I'll tell you, okay?

874
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:50,362
I wish you guys
would stop following me.

875
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:57,267
Can she ever walk!

876
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,904
Hey! Let's take
the elevator.

877
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:01,870
Good idea.

878
00:44:02,671 --> 00:44:04,573
You bastards!

879
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,742
Hi, Jessica.

880
00:44:07,742 --> 00:44:10,479
Can I plug in here?
My desk is gone.

881
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:12,914
Christy!
How you doing?

882
00:44:12,914 --> 00:44:15,850
Hey, beauty!
Welcome back
to reality.

883
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,017
What's your hurry?

884
00:44:17,017 --> 00:44:20,788
Television's always
in a hurry.

885
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:23,823
Have no fear.
TV's here.

886
00:44:23,823 --> 00:44:24,691
It's the mannequins

887
00:44:24,691 --> 00:44:26,827
coming to find out
where the nonfiction is.

888
00:44:26,827 --> 00:44:31,463
What have you got?
Where did you
get this?

889
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,765
I don't have
to look pretty.

890
00:44:32,765 --> 00:44:33,933
I work for
a newspaper.

891
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:36,735
Nineteenth-century
journalism.

892
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:40,503
Yeah, Nancy.
Jack here.

893
00:44:40,503 --> 00:44:41,805
Come on, Christy.

894
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:43,674
Dig up
your own dirt.

895
00:44:43,674 --> 00:44:45,376
They couldn't dig up flowers.

896
00:44:45,376 --> 00:44:47,510
For hard news,
they come here.

897
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:49,680
My TV's just
for my cat.

898
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,414
You'd drop your drawers
to be on TV.

899
00:44:52,414 --> 00:44:57,917
I'd drop my drawers
to fart on overpaid
anchorpersons.

900
00:44:57,917 --> 00:44:58,519
Ooh!

901
00:44:58,519 --> 00:44:59,987
Now, that's a low blow.

902
00:44:59,987 --> 00:45:03,356
Obie, can I use
your Xerox?

903
00:45:03,356 --> 00:45:05,558
It's not a Xerox.
It's better.

904
00:45:05,558 --> 00:45:07,895
25 cents.
It's nothing personal.

905
00:45:07,895 --> 00:45:09,896
I know. I know.

906
00:45:11,798 --> 00:45:14,800
Don't read it.
Just print it.

907
00:45:15,401 --> 00:45:16,368
JESSICA: City press room.

908
00:45:16,368 --> 00:45:19,872
Come on, Christy.
You interviewed him.
Who's going

909
00:45:19,872 --> 00:45:22,441
to the
post-electrocution party?

910
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:23,709
You're sick.

911
00:45:23,709 --> 00:45:27,512
Anyone interested
in an 82-year-old
heart attack victim

912
00:45:27,512 --> 00:45:30,479
who drove through
a store window?

913
00:45:30,479 --> 00:45:32,448
No!

914
00:45:32,448 --> 00:45:34,985
Nothing here, Al.

915
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:39,388
They could postpone
this goddamn execution

916
00:45:39,388 --> 00:45:40,756
until a decent hour.

917
00:45:40,756 --> 00:45:43,023
Nobody watches
at 12:14.

918
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:45,461
Even Ted Koppel's asleep.

919
00:45:45,461 --> 00:45:46,595
Isn't it 12:01?

920
00:45:46,595 --> 00:45:48,896
10 minutes to fry him.
Three to get on TV.

921
00:45:48,896 --> 00:45:54,334
You people have
no morals or integrity.

922
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,670
The conscience
of America.

923
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,705
You make jokes

924
00:45:57,705 --> 00:46:00,372
while an undeserving man
gets electrocuted.

925
00:46:00,372 --> 00:46:03,409
He's not undeserving.
You lost the case.

926
00:46:03,409 --> 00:46:05,410
And the appeals!
Give up!

927
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:08,081
You lost.
He killed
a drug dealer.

928
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:10,414
Jury says
he killed a cop.

929
00:46:10,414 --> 00:46:13,718
The four cops who swore
Kisinski was a dealer

930
00:46:13,718 --> 00:46:15,353
got amnesia in court.

931
00:46:15,353 --> 00:46:17,387
Ridnitz bribed
the witnesses.

932
00:46:17,387 --> 00:46:19,457
I haven't heard that
since you lost.

933
00:46:19,457 --> 00:46:21,690
Another point
you never proved.

934
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:22,592
He did bribe them!

935
00:46:22,592 --> 00:46:24,794
If you weren't
preoccupied with eyeliner,

936
00:46:24,794 --> 00:46:26,695
you might have
reported that.

937
00:46:26,695 --> 00:46:30,566
You just cared about
book and TV deals.

938
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:35,603
I'm surprised
you didn't assume
we were sleeping together.

939
00:46:35,603 --> 00:46:37,104
My God!

940
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,074
Were you?

941
00:46:41,074 --> 00:46:42,776
No!

942
00:46:42,776 --> 00:46:47,080
We usually save
that question for
presidential candidates.

943
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,948
A decent man
is going to die.

944
00:46:49,948 --> 00:46:53,785
You're doing nothing
to prevent it.

945
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:25,912
Gentlemen of the press.

946
00:47:31,918 --> 00:47:35,187
And that includes
you, Jessica.

Christy.

950
00:47:44,629 --> 00:47:47,765
It's for you.
Line one.

951
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:55,771
Yes?

952
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:58,107
Yes, Siegenthaler.

953
00:47:58,107 --> 00:48:01,743
What the hell
are you doing there?

954
00:48:04,145 --> 00:48:05,013
What?

955
00:48:05,013 --> 00:48:05,914
He won't let go.

956
00:48:05,914 --> 00:48:07,449
The police can't
get him loose.

957
00:48:07,449 --> 00:48:10,852
They can't
get him away from
the emergency button.

958
00:48:10,852 --> 00:48:13,120
He's screaming
and kicking them.

959
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,555
Oh, for God's sake!

960
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:17,791
Tell him
I'll be right there.

961
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:27,531
It's a 555 number.

962
00:48:27,531 --> 00:48:29,901
All right.
I'll hold.

963
00:48:29,901 --> 00:48:30,535
Well?

964
00:48:30,535 --> 00:48:33,070
She left the press room
20 minutes ago.

965
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:35,806
Then where the hell
is she?

966
00:48:35,806 --> 00:48:36,840
Sully!

967
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,508
What?

968
00:48:37,508 --> 00:48:40,611
Mr. Berger's
in your office.

969
00:48:51,819 --> 00:48:55,156
Sully, we need more fires.

970
00:48:55,156 --> 00:48:56,857
You got
a problem, Max?

971
00:48:56,857 --> 00:48:59,659
Nothing some
visual action can't cure.

972
00:48:59,659 --> 00:49:01,594
Family visual action.
No smut.

973
00:49:01,594 --> 00:49:04,598
There's too much smut,
not enough fires.

974
00:49:04,598 --> 00:49:06,799
Every day I got
a special unit

975
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:09,568
looking
for smutless fires.

976
00:49:09,568 --> 00:49:10,836
You didn't
have one Thursday.

977
00:49:10,836 --> 00:49:14,138
In Tokyo and London
they don't give a damn
about a Chicago fire.

978
00:49:14,138 --> 00:49:19,977
People watch fires,
rapes, re-enacted murders,
overturned cars

979
00:49:19,977 --> 00:49:21,778
in preference
to anything else,

980
00:49:21,778 --> 00:49:23,814
except maybe a war
that's not too boring.

981
00:49:23,814 --> 00:49:26,984
Those boring wars really cut
into the ratings.

982
00:49:26,984 --> 00:49:30,286
Don't get sarcastic
with me now, Sully.

983
00:49:30,286 --> 00:49:31,621
You're a good newsman,

984
00:49:31,621 --> 00:49:33,922
but you've got contempt
for the public,

985
00:49:33,922 --> 00:49:36,024
and your features
are running too long.

986
00:49:36,024 --> 00:49:39,560
After a minute,
everyone switches channels.

987
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,063
Max, did you ever think
about running

988
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,931
for an office
like president?

989
00:49:44,931 --> 00:49:47,634
And lose all my influence
in Washington?

990
00:49:47,634 --> 00:49:50,770
You got a fire for me
tonight at 6:00?

991
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,638
I got something better.

What's he doing up here?

994

Buying you a present,

995
00:49:56,308 --> 00:49:59,611
but there aren't any stores
on the 17th floor.

996
00:49:59,611 --> 00:50:03,079
I don't know why Sully
sent him up here.

997
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:04,882
I do.

998
00:50:06,284 --> 00:50:08,985
I'll sue. I'll sue.

999
00:50:08,985 --> 00:50:09,986
Blaine.

1000
00:50:09,986 --> 00:50:11,621
Please, honey.
It's okay. It's me.

1001
00:50:11,621 --> 00:50:16,258
How are you?
They want me
to move, but I'm not moving.

1002
00:50:16,258 --> 00:50:20,228
What if I take off
all my clothes,

1003
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:22,130
slip out
of my stockings,

1004
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,199
so I was just
in my underwear.

1005
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:28,703
Then you could
tear that off
with your teeth.

I wouldn't hurt him.

Now for our top story
of the evening.

1057
00:52:55,428 --> 00:52:57,197
In an exclusive interview,

1058
00:52:57,197 --> 00:52:59,265
the first since
his appeal was denied,

1059
00:52:59,265 --> 00:53:02,768
cop killer dad Ike Roscoe
talked to me about the events

when his only son died

1061
00:53:07,071 --> 00:53:10,007
and he killed
an off-duty cop.

1062
00:53:10,007 --> 00:53:14,077
IKE: All those months
I kept thinking,

1063
00:53:14,077 --> 00:53:16,747
"They're not
going to kill me."

1064
00:53:16,747 --> 00:53:20,016
All I wanted
was my boy back,

1065
00:53:20,016 --> 00:53:23,720
but now I know
they are going to kill me.

1066
00:53:24,387 --> 00:53:26,321
CHRISTY: I know
this is painful,

1067
00:53:26,321 --> 00:53:32,093
but would you go back over
that horrible night
one more time?

1068
00:53:33,227 --> 00:53:36,428
He wanted to be
in the newspaper business.

1069
00:53:36,428 --> 00:53:37,363
Darling, please!

1070
00:53:37,363 --> 00:53:39,733
What that man
did to him...

1071
00:53:39,733 --> 00:53:44,736
Needle marks
along his arm,
inside his thigh.

1072
00:53:44,736 --> 00:53:48,307
He became a dealer
to--to keep his habit going.

1073
00:53:48,307 --> 00:53:52,377
That's how I found out
the name of the supplier.

1074
00:53:52,377 --> 00:53:53,978
(GIRLS SINGING)

1075
00:53:53,978 --> 00:53:54,913
Be quiet!
Aw!

1076
00:53:54,913 --> 00:53:56,413
Please, Ike.
Go on if you can.

1077
00:53:56,413 --> 00:53:59,516
Here. Have a piece
of pizza.

1078
00:53:59,516 --> 00:54:00,817
Quiet.

1079
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:02,052
On January 18th...

1080
00:54:02,052 --> 00:54:03,153
Stop with that cat!

1081
00:54:03,153 --> 00:54:04,187
Anybody else
for Coke?

1082
00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:07,388
... he--he went for a walk
completely zonked...
I said quiet.

1083
00:54:07,388 --> 00:54:10,425
...and just
fell off the bridge.

1084
00:54:10,425 --> 00:54:13,094
Maybe I'm getting
what I deserve.

1085
00:54:13,094 --> 00:54:14,395
No. You're not.

1086
00:54:14,395 --> 00:54:17,831
You don't deserve
to be executed.

1087
00:54:17,831 --> 00:54:19,066
I'm gonna be.

1088
00:54:19,066 --> 00:54:22,936
Your Gatorade,
Governor.
Thank you.

1089
00:54:22,936 --> 00:54:24,538
You know what today is?

1090
00:54:24,538 --> 00:54:26,473
It's Houdini's birthday.

1091
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:29,308
I used to practice tricks

1092
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,043
when I was working
as a magician.

1093
00:54:31,043 --> 00:54:33,544
Anthony helped me with
the inverted water bottle.

1094
00:54:33,544 --> 00:54:38,849
Is there a favorite trick
of Anthony's
you could do here?

1095
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:43,355
Not even Houdini
could get out
of this place.

1096
00:54:46,022 --> 00:54:49,493
That's it.
Thank you, Ike.

1097
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,497
A journalist is
supposed to be objective.

1098
00:54:56,497 --> 00:55:00,804
There are some things
more important
than journalism.

1099
00:55:00,804 --> 00:55:03,103
Since this is
my final story,

1100
00:55:03,103 --> 00:55:05,840
I'll lay it
on the line.

1101
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,474
Ike Roscoe
should not be executed.

1102
00:55:08,474 --> 00:55:12,245
He is being used
as a political Ping Pong ball

1103
00:55:12,245 --> 00:55:14,313
by a creep
of a state's attorney

1104
00:55:14,313 --> 00:55:16,916
and a weakling
of a governor.

1105
00:55:16,916 --> 00:55:18,285
What this state needs

1106
00:55:18,285 --> 00:55:21,153
is a chief executive
with the guts to forgive,

1107
00:55:21,153 --> 00:55:26,325
not just a macho hard-ass
because his polls
tell him to be.

1108
00:55:26,325 --> 00:55:28,927
Are you watching,
Springfield?

1109
00:55:28,927 --> 00:55:31,527
You've got
six hours, Governor.

1110
00:55:31,527 --> 00:55:35,932
If you pardon Ike Roscoe,
you could lose the election,

1111
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:39,168
but you might
just regain your conscience.

1112
00:55:39,168 --> 00:55:45,274
This is Christy Colleran,
formerly of
Satellite News Network.

1113
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,612
Thank you, Christy,
and welcome back.

1114
00:55:51,612 --> 00:55:54,448
The execution is planned
for 12:01 tonight.

1115
00:55:54,448 --> 00:55:58,184
Ahem. And as we promised,
we planned or expect

1116
00:55:58,184 --> 00:56:02,888
to have some victims
of previous executions
for you later on.

1117
00:56:02,888 --> 00:56:08,925
Should read, "witnesses
of previous executions
for you later on."

1118
00:56:08,925 --> 00:56:10,461
Christy! Christy!

1119
00:56:10,461 --> 00:56:12,331
You were beautiful.
"Hard-ass creep."

1120
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:17,067
It was inspiring.
We could lose
our license.

1121
00:56:21,071 --> 00:56:21,938
Christy!

1122
00:56:21,938 --> 00:56:24,408
Blaine! Did you see it?
Did you?

1123
00:56:24,408 --> 00:56:26,977
No. I couldn't
get through security.

1124
00:56:26,977 --> 00:56:30,980
That...woman
frisked me.

1125
00:56:32,412 --> 00:56:34,649
I'm gonna kill you.

1126
00:56:34,649 --> 00:56:36,116
Who, me?

1127
00:56:36,116 --> 00:56:37,885
Boss!

1128
00:56:37,885 --> 00:56:39,386
(ALL GROANING)

1129
00:56:39,386 --> 00:56:41,256
Berger.

1130
00:56:44,191 --> 00:56:45,492
Yeah!

1131
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:53,366
What did you expect her
to say, "the alleged creep"?
He's a creep!

1132
00:56:54,933 --> 00:56:59,203
Of course
I screened the tape
before I ran it.

1133
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:07,411
Mr. Berger objects
to the use
of the word "ass."

1134
00:57:07,411 --> 00:57:10,680
He finds it smutty.

1135
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,983
That's all he got
out of it?

1136
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,452
That's all.

1137
00:57:25,494 --> 00:57:28,627
Shit! God!
God damn it!

1138
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:31,299
Let me speak
to the governor.

1139
00:57:31,299 --> 00:57:35,401
I want him to free
that little Roscoe man,

1140
00:57:35,401 --> 00:57:37,336
or I'll blow up
the mansion.

1141
00:57:37,336 --> 00:57:41,572
Let him go, or every black man
will vote for Ridnitz.

1142
00:57:41,572 --> 00:57:45,476
You tell the governor
if he doesn't pardon him,

1143
00:57:45,476 --> 00:57:48,679
he is going to lose
the yuppie vote.

1144
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:54,484
I wish I knew what to do.

1145
00:57:56,485 --> 00:57:57,687
Uh! God!

1146
00:57:57,687 --> 00:58:02,224
We've been discussing
this thing for months.

1147
00:58:02,224 --> 00:58:04,426
I think I'll pardon him.

1148
00:58:04,426 --> 00:58:05,493
Yeah.

1149
00:58:05,493 --> 00:58:06,961
Shouldn't I?

1150
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,530
Well...
It depends...

1151
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:12,232
I've had Wayne keep track
of your telephone calls.

1152
00:58:12,232 --> 00:58:13,600
Here are the numbers.

1153
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,738
We have 367 to pardon
and two to kill.

1154
00:58:17,738 --> 00:58:20,341
Now I'm sure of it.
Right?

1155
00:58:20,341 --> 00:58:21,607
Shrewd.

1156
00:58:21,607 --> 00:58:24,575
Get me 15 minutes
of airtime at 8:00.

1157
00:58:24,575 --> 00:58:31,449
The viewers get mad
when you interrupt their
favorite shows like that.

1158
00:58:31,449 --> 00:58:34,151
Anyways, voters
don't watch primetime.

1159
00:58:34,151 --> 00:58:37,487
Voters watch the news.
11:00, sir.

1160
00:58:37,487 --> 00:58:40,524
I've got a much better idea.
Fifteen minutes at 11:00.

1161
00:58:40,524 --> 00:58:42,292
Good thinking.
And no leaks.

1162
00:58:42,292 --> 00:58:48,630
We don't want
the press to know
until the public does.

1163
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,131
Good decision, Governor.

1164
00:58:50,131 --> 00:58:51,634
That's a winner.

1165
00:58:51,634 --> 00:58:52,467
Actually...
Yipes.

1166
00:58:52,467 --> 00:58:55,602
If I'm going to be
on television, I need sleep.

1167
00:58:55,602 --> 00:58:57,572
Crannock, you
handle the press.

1168
00:58:57,572 --> 00:59:02,141
Tell stations
we want the time,
but don't tell them why.

1169
00:59:02,141 --> 00:59:04,410
I don't agree
with this strategy.

1170
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,512
Come on, let's move it.
There isn't much time.

1171
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:10,516
Johnson, make sure
that makeup girl
is on time tonight.

1172
00:59:10,516 --> 00:59:13,518
Bryce, let's put him
in the blue suit.

1173
00:59:13,518 --> 00:59:15,487
Blue. Right.

1174
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,458
Give me Ridnitz.

1175
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:23,626
It's Crannock.

1176
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,099
Yeah?

1177
00:59:32,534 --> 00:59:34,337
Oh, no.

1178
00:59:36,338 --> 00:59:37,806
When?

1179
00:59:42,576 --> 00:59:45,446
The Governor
is going to pardon him.

1180
00:59:45,446 --> 00:59:48,349
On the 11:00 news!

1181
00:59:48,349 --> 00:59:50,415
You know
what this means.

1182
00:59:50,415 --> 00:59:54,621
If that Roscoe twerp
doesn't fry,
I don't get elected.

1183
00:59:54,621 --> 00:59:57,689
And you all are
out of a job.

1184
00:59:59,491 --> 01:00:03,461
The governor is a...

1185
01:00:03,461 --> 01:00:04,263
Bad person.

1186
01:00:04,263 --> 01:00:06,797
Your families
will all starve.

1187
01:00:06,797 --> 01:00:08,765
What'll we do?

1188
01:00:13,502 --> 01:00:18,474
I hate bimbo...

1189
01:00:20,775 --> 01:00:22,511
Girl...

1190
01:00:23,279 --> 01:00:26,614
Television reporters.

1191
01:00:26,781 --> 01:00:33,153
Wait a minute.
Aah! Calm down, Roy.

1192
01:00:36,522 --> 01:00:42,361
You don't win billion-dollar
personal-injury lawsuits

1193
01:00:42,361 --> 01:00:47,731
by swearing at bleeding-heart
pantyhose reporters.

1194
01:00:49,434 --> 01:00:52,135
We're going
to kill him anyway.

1195
01:00:52,135 --> 01:00:52,603
Huh?

1196
01:00:52,603 --> 01:00:55,406
We're going to move up
the execution

1197
01:00:55,406 --> 01:00:58,507
because of the riots.

1198
01:00:58,507 --> 01:01:00,478
What riots?

1199
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:05,815
The riots
and the bomb threats

1200
01:01:05,815 --> 01:01:09,284
scheduled for midnight
by the subversive,

1201
01:01:09,284 --> 01:01:14,654
anti-death penalty
left-wing terrorists.

1202
01:01:14,654 --> 01:01:16,890
Under advice
from Warden Terwilliger,

1203
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:21,360
it is deemed necessary
to move the execution
up by two hours

1204
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:26,532
in order to insure the safety
of the other mother...

1205
01:01:26,532 --> 01:01:27,900
Law-abiding prisoners.

1206
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,469
Don't you need
a judge to do that?

1207
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:33,605
I've got plenty of judges
in my pocket.

1208
01:01:33,605 --> 01:01:36,473
How do we keep this
from the media?

1209
01:01:36,473 --> 01:01:37,909
Invite them.

1210
01:01:37,909 --> 01:01:41,846
Invite them
to the execution?

1211
01:01:42,779 --> 01:01:48,316
The first televised
execution in history!

1212
01:01:48,316 --> 01:01:50,253
We're going to be
the lead

1213
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:52,420
on every newscast
in this country.

1214
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:57,791
Get down to the prison.
Get all the reporters
over there by 9:45.

1215
01:01:57,791 --> 01:01:59,260
Set up some refreshments.

1216
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:02,364
The media is going
to love me for this!

1217
01:02:02,364 --> 01:02:06,467
Nobody out
law-and-orders Ridnitz.

1218
01:02:06,467 --> 01:02:08,269
Jim, Crannock here.

1219
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:12,238
I need some time
on the 11:00 news. Yeah.

1220
01:02:12,238 --> 01:02:15,440
No, we can't elaborate now.
Is he still asleep?

1221
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,844
The man could sleep
at a hockey game.

1222
01:02:18,844 --> 01:02:21,280
Check this speech.

1223
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,816
Make sure
the press phone calls
come through me.

1224
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:27,751
I love you, Christy!

1225
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:29,953
Tomorrow, America
will love you.

1226
01:02:29,953 --> 01:02:33,789
They will name streets
after you.

1227
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:34,924
Want a drink, Blaine?

1228
01:02:34,924 --> 01:02:38,827
Huh? No. No, thanks.
Not for me.

1229
01:02:38,827 --> 01:02:42,197
The switchboard
is lit up like Las Vegas!

1230
01:02:42,197 --> 01:02:42,964
(ALL CHEERING)

1231
01:02:42,964 --> 01:02:48,302
Here's to the greatest
news team since

01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:15,686
Uh-oh.

1586
01:23:15,686 --> 01:23:16,354
Get in!

1587
01:23:16,354 --> 01:23:19,356
Oh, no.
Get him in!

1588
01:23:19,356 --> 01:23:20,758
No, no.

1589
01:23:20,758 --> 01:23:22,892
Watch your head.

1590
01:23:26,662 --> 01:23:29,331
MAN: What do you mean,
was I rolling?

1591
01:23:29,331 --> 01:23:31,767
What a goddamn
waste of time.

1592
01:23:31,767 --> 01:23:34,335
A wild-goose chase!

1593
01:23:34,335 --> 01:23:36,837
We have
eyewitness reports.
Give it up.

1594
01:23:36,837 --> 01:23:41,541
I personally
am going to guarantee...

1595
01:23:42,509 --> 01:23:44,844
Get them a new poster.

1596
01:23:44,844 --> 01:23:45,712
We're going to take him

1597
01:23:45,712 --> 01:23:48,481
if we have to search
this entire building.

1598
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:52,351
Pillage the area.
Follow me!

1599
01:23:54,286 --> 01:23:55,419
Come on, Zaks.

1600
01:23:55,419 --> 01:23:56,754
Zaks for bum-boy.

1601
01:23:56,754 --> 01:23:58,690
Ah-hmm.

1602
01:23:59,857 --> 01:24:01,525
Watch the hair.

1603
01:24:01,525 --> 01:24:03,961
What are you
doing here?

1604
01:24:03,961 --> 01:24:05,729
Where's Roscoe?

1605
01:24:05,729 --> 01:24:06,929
How should I know?

1606
01:24:06,929 --> 01:24:07,764
Why are you here?

1607
01:24:07,764 --> 01:24:10,334
To make sure
you tell the truth.

1608
01:24:10,334 --> 01:24:11,367
Not again.

1609
01:24:11,367 --> 01:24:14,569
This is wrong.
There were no guns.

1610
01:24:14,569 --> 01:24:16,472
You're making him
a monster.

1611
01:24:16,472 --> 01:24:21,042
We were there!
We know how
he escaped.

1612
01:24:21,042 --> 01:24:24,345
We... Oh.

1613
01:24:32,385 --> 01:24:35,388
Where's the camera?
Camera!

1614
01:24:35,388 --> 01:24:36,923
Roll 'em.

1615
01:24:36,923 --> 01:24:40,794
Okay, Roscoe! We know
you're in there.

1616
01:24:40,794 --> 01:24:43,662
Come on, boys.
Open it up.

1617
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,396
Hey.

1618
01:24:54,537 --> 01:24:56,106
Follow me.

1619
01:25:03,845 --> 01:25:05,046
(GUNSHOTS)

1620
01:25:05,046 --> 01:25:07,882
Oh, you see.
He hasn't got a chance.

1621
01:25:07,882 --> 01:25:11,585
If you don't kill him,
Ridnitz will.

1622
01:25:12,387 --> 01:25:15,689
And the poor man
doesn't have a friend
in the world.

1623
01:25:15,689 --> 01:25:18,425
You never saw
the gentle side of him.

1624
01:25:18,425 --> 01:25:20,993
He likes to read.

1625
01:25:20,993 --> 01:25:23,862
He built the Eiffel Tower
out of toothpicks.

1626
01:25:23,862 --> 01:25:25,131
Ah-choo!

1627
01:25:25,131 --> 01:25:26,931
Hey!
Huh?

1628
01:25:26,931 --> 01:25:30,503
I won't let you do this!

1629
01:25:30,503 --> 01:25:34,604
You can't punish
the poor man anymore!

1630
01:25:34,604 --> 01:25:35,574
I won't let you,

1631
01:25:35,574 --> 01:25:38,575
even if I have to
give up my life.

1632
01:25:42,812 --> 01:25:45,415
Did you see that?

1633
01:25:46,447 --> 01:25:48,417
What did she do that for?

1634
01:25:48,417 --> 01:25:49,817
Is she dead?

1635
01:25:50,651 --> 01:25:53,055
She's...moving.

1636
01:25:53,055 --> 01:25:55,389
Call an ambulance.

1637
01:25:57,125 --> 01:25:59,659
What a night!
What a story!

1638
01:25:59,659 --> 01:26:02,796
Holy smokes!
Get out of my way!

1639
01:26:07,834 --> 01:26:08,834
Come on,
come on!

1640
01:26:08,834 --> 01:26:10,404
Roscoe's lawyer
tried to kill herself.

1641
01:26:10,404 --> 01:26:16,540
She threw herself
out the window.
There was blood everywhere!

1642
01:26:48,869 --> 01:26:52,171
Hey, Sully!
You missed
all the action.

1643
01:26:52,171 --> 01:26:53,807
Morsini,
what happened?

1644
01:26:53,807 --> 01:26:57,109
That ACLU broad
dumped herself
out the window,

1645
01:26:57,109 --> 01:26:59,178
busted the chandelier.

1646
01:26:59,178 --> 01:26:59,878
Ludlow!

1647
01:26:59,878 --> 01:27:02,079
Yes?
Interview that woman!

1648
01:27:02,079 --> 01:27:03,648
Me?
Don't you want
the story?

1649
01:27:03,648 --> 01:27:06,017
Yes! Come on, guys!
Yeah, let's go!

1650
01:27:06,017 --> 01:27:09,187
Hey, you guys, move!
Go, go, go!

1651
01:27:09,187 --> 01:27:12,555
What's your hurry?
She's not going anywhere.

1652
01:27:12,555 --> 01:27:13,856
Get the door.
Why?

1653
01:27:13,856 --> 01:27:16,626
Get the door!
Eric, shutters!

1654
01:27:16,626 --> 01:27:18,459
Come here, Ike.

1655
01:27:18,459 --> 01:27:21,130
She did it
for me!

1656
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:23,098
We have
to get him out.

1657
01:27:23,098 --> 01:27:26,201
It's swarming
with cops out there.

1658
01:27:26,201 --> 01:27:28,671
Why did you do it?
Did it hurt?

1659
01:27:28,671 --> 01:27:32,240
What were you thinking
as you were falling?

1660
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:33,975
Ha ha ha!

1661
01:27:33,975 --> 01:27:35,641
She's hysterical.

1662
01:27:35,641 --> 01:27:37,611
Are you
hysterical?

1663
01:27:37,611 --> 01:27:39,246
All aboard!

1664
01:27:39,246 --> 01:27:41,045
Porter!

1665
01:27:43,716 --> 01:27:47,485
In one of the most
violent prison breaks
in Chicago history...

1666
01:27:47,485 --> 01:27:51,789
...murderer Ike Roscoe escaped
his date with destiny.

1667
01:27:51,789 --> 01:27:53,523
Shortly after
his jailbreak...

1668
01:27:53,523 --> 01:27:55,926
...his attorney
and alleged lover,

1669
01:27:55,926 --> 01:27:57,994
Pamela Farbrother,
threw herself...

1670
01:27:57,994 --> 01:27:59,696
...from that window.

1671
01:27:59,696 --> 01:28:01,966
She suffered
massive hemorrhaging,
concussions...

1672
01:28:01,966 --> 01:28:06,836
...and contusions.
She escaped death
by a hair's-breadth.

1673
01:28:06,836 --> 01:28:08,002
This is a bizarre twist...

1674
01:28:08,002 --> 01:28:13,174
...in what will be hailed
as the most violent crime...

1675
01:28:13,174 --> 01:28:14,675
...of the last 10 days.

1676
01:28:14,675 --> 01:28:17,979
State's Attorney Ridnitz
has vowed to capture Roscoe...

1677
01:28:17,979 --> 01:28:19,078
...dead or alive.

1678
01:28:19,078 --> 01:28:22,649
He is armed
and decidedly dangerous.

1679
01:28:22,649 --> 01:28:24,050
This is Pamela Farbrother.

1680
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:25,985
Pamela, give me
a break.

1681
01:28:25,985 --> 01:28:28,822
Help me,
this is important.

1682
01:28:28,822 --> 01:28:30,054
I've always been
there for you.

1683
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:33,025
Pamela, we're women
in a man's world,

1684
01:28:33,025 --> 01:28:34,760
sisters.

1685
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:35,860
CHRISTY: And then?

1686
01:28:35,860 --> 01:28:38,128
There was a buzz.
The lights went out.

1687
01:28:38,128 --> 01:28:40,265
What about
the buckles?

1688
01:28:40,265 --> 01:28:41,564
It was dark.

1689
01:28:41,564 --> 01:28:44,166
Don't set the scene.
Get the facts!

1690
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:45,702
I am!

1691
01:28:45,702 --> 01:28:46,136
Okay.

1692
01:28:46,136 --> 01:28:47,270
You were in
the buckles...

1693
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:49,604
Where was Ridnitz?
Where was the warden?

1694
01:28:49,604 --> 01:28:50,672
Do you want
to do this?

1695
01:28:50,672 --> 01:28:53,275
I haven't got any makeup on.
Well, it wouldn't help.

1696
01:28:53,275 --> 01:28:54,876
Please, don't fight.

1697
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:56,577
BOTH: Well?

1698
01:28:56,577 --> 01:28:58,213
Well...

1699
01:28:58,213 --> 01:29:00,148
Well, it was easy.

1700
01:29:00,148 --> 01:29:03,919
You turn your fingers
and slip your wrist out.

1701
01:29:03,919 --> 01:29:05,886
Then I took that pen...

1702
01:29:05,886 --> 01:29:06,987
Sully!
Not now!

1703
01:29:06,987 --> 01:29:10,223
Someone's coming!

1704
01:29:12,558 --> 01:29:13,859
I'll take him
to the office.

1705
01:29:13,859 --> 01:29:16,995
Ridnitz will kill him
if he's found
in the copier.

1706
01:29:16,995 --> 01:29:18,330
He'll kill him anyway.

1707
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:20,264
Hold on,
Mr. Sullivan.
What?

1708
01:29:20,264 --> 01:29:22,100
Will you take care
of Pamela?

1709
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,968
Yes. If she lives,
I'll give her a job.

1710
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:26,103
If she dies, I'll name
a foundation after her.

1711
01:29:26,103 --> 01:29:28,773
Thanks, Mr. Sullivan.
You're welcome.

1712
01:29:28,773 --> 01:29:30,274
Get down.

1713
01:29:31,273 --> 01:29:32,909
I felt like
Ted Koppel.

1714
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:35,945
That broad doesn't know
how to jump
out of a window.

1715
01:29:35,945 --> 01:29:38,180
Wait till that bitch
reads my version.

1716
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:41,216
Can we get rid
of the electronic parasites?

1717
01:29:41,216 --> 01:29:43,284
This is a newspaper office.

1718
01:29:43,284 --> 01:29:44,285
ZAKS: Up yours!

1719
01:29:44,285 --> 01:29:47,788
I love this machine.
I'd like to buy it.

1720
01:29:47,788 --> 01:29:48,288
Right now?

1721
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:51,724
We don't have
a machine like this,
do we, Christy?

1722
01:29:51,724 --> 01:29:52,226
Oh, golly, no.

1723
01:29:52,226 --> 01:29:55,162
When Sully wants something,
there's no stopping him.

1724
01:29:55,162 --> 01:29:58,265
Listen to the price.
$22,000 new.

1725
01:29:58,265 --> 01:30:01,801
I'll give you
$20,000 for it.
Cash.

1726
01:30:01,801 --> 01:30:03,903
It's two years old.

1727
01:30:03,903 --> 01:30:06,003
An antique.
$20,500.

1728
01:30:06,003 --> 01:30:12,177
I'm not authorized
to sell this.
Besides, it's part of me.

1729
01:30:12,177 --> 01:30:13,776
Sentimental value, huh?

1730
01:30:13,776 --> 01:30:14,979
All right, another $500.

1731
01:30:14,979 --> 01:30:18,248
This is highway robbery,
I'm telling you.

1732
01:30:18,248 --> 01:30:20,116
I thought
you said cash.

1733
01:30:20,116 --> 01:30:24,154
Cash, IOU,
same thing.

1734
01:30:27,122 --> 01:30:28,189
Blaine!

1735
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:30,159
Christy, you missed
the train.

1736
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:32,058
There is no flight
till 3:00 a.m.

1737
01:30:32,058 --> 01:30:33,394
There's been
a new development.

1738
01:30:33,394 --> 01:30:34,695
Hi!
I've had it with you.

1739
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:37,397
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't feel that way
about you.

1740
01:30:37,397 --> 01:30:38,698
What are you doing?

1741
01:30:38,698 --> 01:30:40,700
Sully just bought
a Xerox.

1742
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,969
What did you
pay for it?

1743
01:30:42,969 --> 01:30:43,936
$20,000.

1744
01:30:43,936 --> 01:30:47,407
$21,000, but I'm not
authorized to sell it.

1745
01:30:47,407 --> 01:30:49,942
No way for 21 G's.

1746
01:30:49,942 --> 01:30:53,345
We bought six
88 Canon NP7550s.

1747
01:30:53,345 --> 01:30:55,213
$18,095 each,
brand-new.

1748
01:30:55,213 --> 01:30:58,183
Who are you?
It's this machine or nothing.

1749
01:30:58,183 --> 01:30:59,150
Don't be insane.

1750
01:30:59,150 --> 01:31:03,920
This is two years old.
Look at these insides.

1751
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,321
Blaine!

1752
01:31:06,254 --> 01:31:08,257
Haven't you got
something to do?

1753
01:31:08,257 --> 01:31:12,762
We have to get
on a 3:00 a.m. flight.

1754
01:31:12,762 --> 01:31:14,396
I missed the train.

1755
01:31:14,396 --> 01:31:15,997
Don't blame yourself.

1756
01:31:15,997 --> 01:31:17,831
I blame you.

1757

Oh.
Let's go.

Oh, oh, I can't...

1759
01:31:21,137 --> 01:31:24,239
We, uh...
Well, I have a...

1760
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:28,908
She's in the middle
of a fast-breaking
news story.

1761
01:31:28,908 --> 01:31:29,977
You what?

1762
01:31:29,977 --> 01:31:32,178
My wife hates
the news business.

1763
01:31:32,178 --> 01:31:37,449
She feels oppressed
by it, right?

1764
01:31:38,916 --> 01:31:40,817
Right?

1765
01:31:40,817 --> 01:31:42,454
Well?

1766
01:31:45,922 --> 01:31:48,392
Christy, I want
to take you home.

1767
01:31:48,392 --> 01:31:50,727
I want to give you
a talk show,

1768
01:31:50,727 --> 01:31:54,231
and treat you
like a woman.

1769
01:31:54,231 --> 01:31:56,131
Come on.

1770
01:31:56,131 --> 01:31:58,033
Hard to turn
that one down.

1771

My apartment overlooks
the goddamn United Nations!

What?

1773
01:32:04,772 --> 01:32:06,840
Come with me now,
or you're not coming!

1774
01:32:06,840 --> 01:32:08,308
Treat her rough.
She likes that.

1775
01:32:08,308 --> 01:32:10,244
I'm not usually
like this,

1776
01:32:10,244 --> 01:32:12,778
but I'm putting
my foot down!

1777
01:32:12,778 --> 01:32:15,916
Darling.
That's you.

Blaine,

1780
01:32:19,719 --> 01:32:22,422
true love is based
on mutual trust.

1781
01:32:22,422 --> 01:32:26,158
I'm just asking you
to trust me for five minutes.

1782

I don't know.

1783
01:32:27,025 --> 01:32:31,428
And sex. It's based
on plenty of sex.

1784
01:32:32,262 --> 01:32:36,332
Five minutes starting now. Go.
I will not! This is my machine!

Wait a minute!

1793
01:32:50,946 --> 01:32:54,983
Want to work for me making
twice what you're making now?

Forget it.
He hates television.
Remember?

1795
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:00,919
What would I do?

1796
01:33:00,919 --> 01:33:02,355
Gain some fat,
you'll be a movie critic.

1797
01:33:02,355 --> 01:33:05,057
I haven't seen movies in years.
Well, they haven't changed.

1798
01:33:05,057 --> 01:33:07,127
You like something,
you give it 10 bow ties.

1799

If not, five.

thoughtful opinions.

Sure, go catch a porno,
or go watch cable.

you're our man in the dark.

01:34:12,448 --> 01:34:16,286
You're trying
to get that
out of here!

in there!

two news guys

there was a pardon

"I beg your pardon."

because the governor
was going to pardon him!

moved it up

That man needs help!

1932
01:39:02,398 --> 01:39:04,265
Saving the life
of the man

1933
01:39:04,265 --> 01:39:06,434
that was going
to fry him!

1934
01:39:06,434 --> 01:39:07,301
Is Pamela okay?

1935
01:39:07,301 --> 01:39:10,770
Yes. The only one
in trouble here is Ridnitz.

1936
01:39:10,770 --> 01:39:14,274
He's confessed to bribery,
attempted murder

1937
01:39:14,274 --> 01:39:16,775
and about
14 other charges.

1938
01:39:16,775 --> 01:39:19,845
What we have is a
state's attorney's word

1939
01:39:19,845 --> 01:39:21,612
against that
of a reporter person.

1940
01:39:21,612 --> 01:39:25,651
No! A state's attorney's word
against an Ampex tape,

1941
01:39:25,651 --> 01:39:29,786
which I want
on television
in 15 minutes!

1942
01:39:30,553 --> 01:39:31,488
See you in jail, Roy.

1943
01:39:31,488 --> 01:39:35,525
You're an accessory
after the fact,
and you're going to jail!

1944
01:39:35,525 --> 01:39:37,493
He's pardoned,
you're pardoned,

1945
01:39:37,493 --> 01:39:40,464
you're pardoned,
and you're not.

1946
01:39:40,464 --> 01:39:42,597
MAN: No visitors, Roy?

1947
01:39:42,597 --> 01:39:44,432
How can I
thank you two?

1948
01:39:44,432 --> 01:39:45,834
We were just
doing our job.

1949
01:39:45,834 --> 01:39:49,802
You're not much, Governor,
but you're all we got.

1950
01:39:53,239 --> 01:39:54,608
Siegenthaler!

1951
01:39:54,608 --> 01:39:55,441
Yeah?

1952
01:39:55,441 --> 01:39:56,310
You want this story?

1953
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:58,845
Yeah!
You've got it, son.
Break their chops!

1954
01:39:58,845 --> 01:40:01,446
Yes, sir!
Ha ha ha!

1955
01:40:04,116 --> 01:40:05,183
Blaine!

1956
01:40:05,183 --> 01:40:06,718
Hello.

1957
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:12,422
Blaine, I've got
something to tell you.

1958
01:40:12,422 --> 01:40:17,194
There's something
I've got to tell you.

1959
01:40:17,194 --> 01:40:20,630
It's pretty important.
Could you excuse us?

1960
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:21,397
Sure.

1961
01:40:21,397 --> 01:40:26,235
I've been thinking,
and what we have here
is apples and oranges,

1962
01:40:26,235 --> 01:40:28,170
major apples and oranges.

1963
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:31,706
I don't think this is
going to work out.

1964
01:40:31,706 --> 01:40:32,507
You don't?

1965
01:40:32,507 --> 01:40:34,810
Do you need
to sit down?

1966
01:40:34,810 --> 01:40:36,177
No. I'm okay.

1967
01:40:36,177 --> 01:40:38,246
You don't hate
the news.

1968
01:40:38,246 --> 01:40:41,481
You don't feel
oppressed by it.
You love it!

1969
01:40:41,481 --> 01:40:43,716
You'd be happier
here with him

1970
01:40:43,716 --> 01:40:46,485
than coming
to New York
with me.

1971
01:40:46,485 --> 01:40:48,153
Mind telling me why?

1972
01:40:48,153 --> 01:40:52,925
Well...because here
I make a difference.

1973
01:40:54,559 --> 01:40:56,261
Hmm.

1974
01:40:57,163 --> 01:40:59,196
I'm sorry
to have to hurt you,

1975
01:40:59,196 --> 01:41:02,533
but one day
you'll understand.

1976
01:41:02,533 --> 01:41:03,501
(POP)

1977
01:41:03,501 --> 01:41:07,703
I'm really
quite a complicated person.

1978
01:41:12,741 --> 01:41:15,177
Nice guy.
Wish I'd got
to know him better.

1979
01:41:15,177 --> 01:41:17,378
Sully!
Great taste
in champagne.

1980
01:41:17,378 --> 01:41:18,280
I've got his ring!

1981
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:20,381
We'll hock it.
Pay for the honeymoon.

1982
01:41:20,381 --> 01:41:23,418
Oh, but we can't--
Did you say honeymoon?

1983
01:41:23,418 --> 01:41:24,485
Yes, I did. Don't worry.

1984
01:41:24,485 --> 01:41:27,588
We'll send the ring back
with the gym equipment.

1985
01:41:27,588 --> 01:41:28,221
Sully.

1986
01:41:28,221 --> 01:41:31,325
You're not going
to get sentimental
on me, are you?

1987
01:41:31,325 --> 01:41:31,925
Oh, no. No.

1988
01:41:31,925 --> 01:41:34,694
Say you love me
and that stuff?

1989
01:41:34,694 --> 01:41:36,495
Not unless you do.

1990
01:41:36,495 --> 01:41:39,663
I want to go someplace nice
this time, though.

1991
01:41:39,663 --> 01:41:40,799
Gorgeous.

1992
01:41:40,799 --> 01:41:43,233
And no news.
No news.

1993
01:41:43,233 --> 01:41:45,368
Where?

1994
01:41:53,244 --> 01:41:54,443
Excuse me.

1995
01:41:54,443 --> 01:41:55,611
Your drinks.

1996
01:41:55,611 --> 01:41:57,346
Hmm?

1997
01:41:57,346 --> 01:41:59,549
Oh!

1998
01:41:59,549 --> 01:42:00,683
Thank you.

1999
01:42:00,683 --> 01:42:02,483
You're welcome.

2000
01:42:02,483 --> 01:42:04,221
Cheers.

2001
01:42:04,987 --> 01:42:06,385
Mmm!

2002
01:42:06,385 --> 01:42:09,390
I think we should
do this more often.

2003
01:42:09,390 --> 01:42:10,758
Yeah.

2004
01:42:10,758 --> 01:42:13,393
(BOOM)

2005
01:42:13,393 --> 01:42:15,963
What? You didn't?

2006
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:19,365
Oh, come on. Please!

2007
01:42:19,365 --> 01:42:22,534
Ha ha ha!
