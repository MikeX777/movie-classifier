2
00:00:39,597 --> 00:00:41,033
Tap out, tap out!

3
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:51,509
Bit in the head.

4
00:00:52,244 --> 00:00:54,579
Get it, three, two, one, go.

5
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:55,547
Freeze now!

6
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,681
Hey, let me see your hands!

7
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:59,018
On the ground, on the ground,
on your faces right now!

8
00:00:59,051 --> 00:00:59,952
Tex, Biggs!

9
00:01:00,953 --> 00:01:04,256
What you got, what you
be still fighting, huh?

10
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,257
Get down!

11
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,126
We're not with him!
We don't even know him!

12
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,760
They just hired us,
they just hired us

13
00:01:08,793 --> 00:01:10,062
for some stupid dance wrestling.

14
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:11,163
Sir, just let us go.

15
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:12,797
We just met them
today, I swear.

16
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:15,067
Get your stuff and get out.

17
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:17,635
Keep your hands
right up there, boy!

18
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:18,803
Get out!

19
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:21,007
- Tex.
- One locked door.

20
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:26,212
All right listen up in there!

21
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:27,812
You do not wanna
take a shot at me.

22
00:01:27,846 --> 00:01:28,880
I am heavily armed

23
00:01:28,913 --> 00:01:31,816
and I will turn this place
into the O.K. Corral!

24
00:01:31,916 --> 00:01:32,985
Speak up!

25
00:01:33,019 --> 00:01:35,287
I got a nine, I'm
putting it down.

26
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:38,690
Hands, hands, hands!
Behind your neck.

27
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,659
Behind your neck,
behind your neck.

28
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:45,897
Take him to the front
with the others.

29
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,167
Should I
call Detroit PD, sir?

30
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,334
No, not yet.

31
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:25,304
I know a woman in the suburbs
who runs a no kill shelter.

32
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:27,973
Get the dogs out of here first
then we call PD.

33
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:29,141
Hoo rah.

34
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:30,943
Get his ass up.

35
00:02:35,247 --> 00:02:38,817
You stole a dog.
A rich man's dog.

36
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,919
Rich men don't like
having their dog stolen.

37
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,289
Paid us good money
to track you down.

38
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,624
I'll give it back.

39
00:02:46,658 --> 00:02:48,827
Yeah you will.
You definitely will.

40
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,895
But there's a price
you gotta pay.

41
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,732
See I don't like dog fighters.

42
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,069
You like dog fighters, Tex?

43
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:58,903
I do not.

44
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:00,805
Biggs, hold my weapon.

45
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:04,676
Just so you can never say
that I sucker punched you.

46
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:06,678
I'm about to beat your ass.

47
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,155
Come on, Cap.

48
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,758
Showed him that.

49
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,261
Just like I taught
him when he was a boy.

50
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:24,863
Yeah just like
you taught me, sir.

51
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:27,933
Listen,
I want the names

52
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:30,069
and addresses of every
single dog fighter

53
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:32,171
in every house in this city.

54
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:33,205
You're not a cop.

55
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:33,905
Oh no.

56
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,207
Tex, we got any coke in the car?

57
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:37,143
- A whole lot of it.
- Yeah, bring it in.

58
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,111
Bring in enough for
a life sentence.

59
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,575
Ooh, let's get some horses in
the background.

60
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:51,944
Oh my gosh, we have to have
the horse in the background.

61
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,878
The horse in this one.

62
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:54,912
- Cheese.
- Yes!

63
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:56,282
That was perfect.

64
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:08,427
Keep it balanced.

65
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,296
Very good, very good.

66
00:06:11,397 --> 00:06:13,332
Smile, birthday girl.

67
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:16,602
Yeah, you wanna look
good for your boyfriend.

68
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:17,569
Bombshell shot.

69
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:19,038
Stop, he's not my boyfriend.

70
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,272
I've never even met him.

71
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:22,174
Love at first sight.

72
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:25,544
Don't worry, Joanna,
I'll have her home by six.

73
00:06:25,577 --> 00:06:26,545
Promise.

74
00:06:26,578 --> 00:06:27,713
Not worried at all,

75
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:29,847
I'm just glad you could take
the girls to the stables.

76
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:31,350
I think she's a natural.

77
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:33,319
Allison's been
wanting that for years.

78
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:36,221
So, how goes the
surprise party planning?

79
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:39,425
Well, since you were able
to get them out of the house,

80
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,260
I was able to make some calls.
It's gonna be fun.

81
00:06:41,293 --> 00:06:42,594
Okay, I'll see you in a bit.

82
00:06:42,628 --> 00:06:44,596
Time to dehorse your daughter.

83
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,599
bye.

84
00:06:50,502 --> 00:06:52,304
Great job, Allison.

85
00:06:52,338 --> 00:06:53,838
Sarah, you're up.

86
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:57,609
He's a hottie.

87
00:06:58,644 --> 00:07:00,379
Cheating on Tyler already.

88
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:02,114
I'm turning 16 tomorrow

89
00:07:02,147 --> 00:07:05,351
so I'm not gonna be
this young forever.

90
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,365
Afternoon, John.

91
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,033
Maggie.

92
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,234
How'd it go, Captain?

93
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:25,237
Everybody gather
around the table.

94
00:07:38,717 --> 00:07:40,419
Aaron, you joining us?

95
00:07:40,452 --> 00:07:41,286
No.

96
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:45,324
All right, Detroit PD
called every single one

97
00:07:45,357 --> 00:07:46,959
of those animal abusers.

98
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:48,026
Well done, team.

99
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:52,598
Hey Captain, don't forget.

100
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:54,933
You bird dogged those
losers for six weeks now.

101
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:57,236
We all thought it was gonna
be a dead end, remember?

102
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,037
Sixth sense, I was
thinking like a dog.

103
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:03,409
All right, I also
hooked Detroit PD

104
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,512
into two other dog
rings, both local.

105
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:09,381
Okay, all the names, phone
numbers, addresses, everything.

106
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:10,616
So that's big, well done, guys.

107
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:15,421
All right.

108
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,991
And, our employer
gave us a nice fat tip

109
00:08:19,024 --> 00:08:20,692
so it's steak dinners on me.

110
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:26,999
Hey, you want
me to do the drive

111
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:28,434
to Cleveland tomorrow
on that Simpson matter?

112
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,602
Now that the dog case
is closed and all?

113
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:32,438
I can handle it, John.

114
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,672
I don't mean any disrespect.

115
00:08:33,705 --> 00:08:35,107
Well it is disrespectful.

116
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,708
But my case is closed.

117
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:38,310
So you think you
should take my case?

118
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:41,447
I think there's a missing
boy and I'm available.

119
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,615
John, I can handle it.

120
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,517
That's why I hired you, Karen.

121
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:48,053
Tex, you'll get lead on
another case real soon.

122
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:51,223
Hey, you give the
orders, I just follow.

123
00:08:51,256 --> 00:08:53,759
What are we at now, 90 hours?

124
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:54,660
96.

125
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:57,296
Aaron, how we doing?

126
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:02,601
Hey yo pencil neck, the
lady's talking to you.

127
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,470
Oh that's hysterical.

128
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:09,174
You must be the funniest
guy in your GED program.

129
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,043
Boy, I'm educated
in all kind of stuff

130
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:13,011
that you don't
know nothin' about.

131
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:14,746
Anything about.

132
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,783
Obviously English is not
one of your strong suits.

133
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:19,384
Well I tell you
what, I'm educated

134
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:22,254
in Greco-Roman wrestling
and western boxing.

135
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:23,755
So how you like that, chump?

136
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:25,657
Boys, I don't want any
of that in this office,

137
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:27,226
do you hear me?

138
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:28,227
It leads to arguing.

139
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,228
Arguing leads to cussing

140
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:32,197
and cussing leads to blasphemy.

141
00:09:32,231 --> 00:09:33,332
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,533
Good.

143
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:37,102
Aaron, how we doing
on finding that boy?

144
00:09:42,641 --> 00:09:44,776
I cracked all of his
passwords fast enough.

145
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,279
I thought I had a lead that
would send us straight to him

146
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:48,480
but it didn't pan out.

147
00:09:48,514 --> 00:09:51,149
Had to widen the gap.
Need more time.

148
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:52,451
How long have you
been on that computer?

149
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:53,318
17 hours.

150
00:09:53,352 --> 00:09:56,121
Hey, you need
dinner and some sleep.

151
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:57,556
I've got frozen
pizzas in the fridge.

152
00:09:57,589 --> 00:09:59,291
And a lot of soda.

153
00:09:59,324 --> 00:10:03,161
I can lock in and go 72
hours when I have to.

154
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:05,497
Go to dinner.

155
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:10,302
I'll tell you meatheads what
door to kick down soon enough.

156
00:10:11,169 --> 00:10:12,271
Well dinner's on you, boss.

157
00:10:12,304 --> 00:10:13,839
I already said that.

158
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:16,241
Yeah, just getting
it for the record.

159
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:17,809
Well, let's do it.

160
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:29,821
Hey yo, pencil neck.

161
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:33,191
You doing all right, 'cuz.

162
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,130
My man.

163
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,242
Allison has a boyfriend.

164
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,109
Really?

165
00:10:51,143 --> 00:10:52,110
Grow up.

166
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:53,579
Honey, do you think
you could enjoy dinner

167
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,580
without texting for

168
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:55,581
- 10 minutes?
- Mom!

169
00:10:55,614 --> 00:10:56,582
Hang on a sec.

170
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,350
Oh, yeah, I'm hanging.

171
00:10:58,383 --> 00:10:59,818
Listen to your mother.

172
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:02,721
You can continue your love
affair after dinner, okay?

173
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:04,823
Oh sure, Dad speaks
and you listen.

174
00:11:04,856 --> 00:11:07,826
I ask nicely and
it's "Hang on a sec."

175
00:11:07,859 --> 00:11:08,827
He's the man.

176
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,395
Ooh.

177
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:11,697
Who teaches them
this kind of stuff?

178
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,332
We have a progressive home.

179
00:11:13,365 --> 00:11:16,735
How'd these teenage girls
succumb to these norms?

180
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:18,370
You know, I just
think Rachel's jelly

181
00:11:18,403 --> 00:11:20,372
because she doesn't
have a boyfriend.

182
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:22,174
Mhmm, and she's too young.

183
00:11:22,207 --> 00:11:23,308
Whatever.

184
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:24,743
I don't wanna date
some middle school boy.

185
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:26,478
Next year I'll be a freshman

186
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:28,680
and I'll get a football
playing senior.

187
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:30,182
Oh, fantastic.

188
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,357
Hey, Tyler.

189
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,491
Hey beautiful.

190
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:40,826
I thought you'd never be online.

191
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:41,793
I miss you.

192
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:47,232
We just
talked last night, silly.

193
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:50,636
I wanna
meet you so bad.

194
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,838
Me too.

195
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:55,173
Meet me tonight.

196
00:11:57,275 --> 00:12:00,445
I have
school tomorrow.

197
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:01,513
Just for a little bit.

198
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:03,482
I promise I'll be good.

199
00:12:15,928 --> 00:12:16,762
Tyler?

200
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:17,663
Hey.

201
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:18,530
Hi.

202
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:19,665
Where are we going?

203
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,466
You'll see.

204
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:14,720
No please!

205
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:16,989
Keep moving!

206
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:17,923
Stop, no.

207
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,895
No, no!

208
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:24,796
Stop!

209
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,697
Shut up.

210
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:29,835
Y'all hoes get
back in your cages.

211
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,708
Please let me go.

212
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:38,410
Please let me go!

213
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,512
I own you now.

214
00:13:40,545 --> 00:13:43,415
And you ain't never
going nowhere.

215
00:14:12,945 --> 00:14:14,312
Honey, can you
go tell your sister

216
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:15,647
that breakfast is almost ready?

217
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,883
Hold on, let me post
something real quick.

218
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,052
Now, young lady, please.

219
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:24,856
Hey, breakfast is almost done.

220
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,825
Ah, just coffee for
me, hon, I gotta run.

221
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:29,594
But you missed it yesterday.

222
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:31,396
Oh, I gotta close
this deal, babe.

223
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:32,731
We need the money.

224
00:14:32,764 --> 00:14:33,899
That's true.

225
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:37,803
All right, do you have
time for a good luck kiss?

226
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,703
Always.

227
00:14:50,116 --> 00:14:50,983
Allison?

228
00:14:56,122 --> 00:14:57,923
She isn't there, Mom.

229
00:14:57,957 --> 00:14:59,457
What?

230
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,827
No, it's still early.

231
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,096
Come on, Joanna,
it's her birthday.

232
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,365
She just probably snuck out
early to be with friends.

233
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,035
Sweet 16, big day.

234
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:11,503
You remember what that was like.

235
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,105
Yes, 100 years ago.

236
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,941
Wish me luck, old girl.

237
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:16,775
All right, old man.

238
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:45,972
Y'all did good last night.

239
00:15:50,176 --> 00:15:52,510
Thank you, Daddy.

240
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:54,013
Now y'all have some candy

241
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:56,082
and get you a good sleep.

242
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,988
Don't put you in no cages.

243
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:05,157
You gonna come back
and see me later?

244
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:07,692
Oh yeah, baby girl.

245
00:16:07,726 --> 00:16:10,862
Just gotta break in this
new girl right quick.

246
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:16,102
Let one of the
other guys do it.

247
00:16:16,135 --> 00:16:18,170
Bitch, shut up
telling me my business.

248
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:19,939
Lucky I don't beat your ass.

249
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:23,742
Just take your candy
and go to sleep.

250
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,645
Maybe tomorrow I don't
give you no candy.

251
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:27,646
You feel me?

252
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,847
No, please!

253
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,917
Bitch shut up and
get in your cage!

254
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:46,098
First day of school, white girl.

255
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:57,876
This is moi weird.

256
00:16:57,909 --> 00:16:59,544
She hasn't texted me all day.

257
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:00,512
Same here.

258
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:01,680
You think she's playing sick?

259
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:02,647
On her birthday, no,

260
00:17:02,681 --> 00:17:05,217
that would be social suicide.

261
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:06,918
Ugh, my phone is vibrating.

262
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:09,688
Who calls anyone anymore?

263
00:17:09,721 --> 00:17:11,523
OMG, it's her mom.

264
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:12,824
Should I answer it?

265
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:13,792
Um, yeah.

266
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:18,730
Hi, Mrs. R, is Allison okay?

267
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:25,804
Not a peepster.

268
00:17:29,075 --> 00:17:29,942
Copy that.

269
00:17:30,977 --> 00:17:32,510
That girl is MIA.

270
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:36,581
Man, you right about her.

271
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:40,618
Dude, she gonna make us
a lot of money for real.

272
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:42,687
I'm about to go again.

273
00:17:42,721 --> 00:17:43,555
No.

274
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:44,556
What?

275
00:17:44,589 --> 00:17:45,757
Go get you one
them other hoes.

276
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,026
What?

277
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:49,228
You heard what I said.

278
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:51,863
Man, come on, for real?

279
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:52,764
Come on.

280
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:57,937
Do that thing that
you know I like.

281
00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:00,272
Please.

282
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:06,578
Please, Mister.

283
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,682
If you let me go home,

284
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,785
I promise I won't tell anyone.

285
00:18:13,818 --> 00:18:16,521
My name is Daddy, not Mister.

286
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:18,057
Daddy.

287
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,893
And you ain't never
going nowhere.

288
00:18:34,173 --> 00:18:35,941
Have some candy.

289
00:18:35,975 --> 00:18:37,809
Make you feel better.

290
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:04,203
Rose, it's not like her.

291
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:05,837
Not a single text.

292
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,339
Well, she's 16 today.

293
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:09,841
Maybe she's with
her new boyfriend.

294
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:11,377
What new boyfriend?

295
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,945
Tyler.

296
00:19:12,978 --> 00:19:14,213
I saw a picture
of him yesterday.

297
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:15,114
Cute kid.

298
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:18,084
She never told me.

299
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:19,684
Well, you're her mother, J.

300
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:20,885
It's a teenager's
first prerogative

301
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:24,223
to keep stuff from
parental units.

302
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:27,659
Hello?

303
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,064
Hey hon, I just
sold the Miller place.

304
00:19:32,098 --> 00:19:33,332
Done deal.

305
00:19:33,365 --> 00:19:36,168
Case, Allison's missing.

306
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:37,937
What do
you mean missing?

307
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,671
I mean I haven't heard
a single text from her,

308
00:19:39,704 --> 00:19:41,006
none of her friends
have heard from her

309
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,374
and I'm scared.

310
00:19:42,408 --> 00:19:44,742
Honey,
it's her sweet 16.

311
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:45,877
She's out with her friends.

312
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,279
Look, just calm down.

313
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:50,116
I'll be home in 10 minutes.

314
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:51,850
Betcha she walks
through that door

315
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:54,286
any minute with that new boy.

316
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,424
If I win, you're in to
me for martinis at Al's.

317
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:01,127
That's a bet I'd gladly lose.

318
00:20:09,335 --> 00:20:11,003
Look, why don't we
give her another hour?

319
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:12,304
No.

320
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:14,974
Joanna, try to relax, dear.

321
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,908
I can't, Mom, my
daughter's missing.

322
00:20:16,942 --> 00:20:18,743
We don't know that yet.

323
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:21,947
I can feel it in my heart,
something's terribly wrong.

324
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:23,015
All her best friends are here,

325
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:24,150
she didn't go to school.

326
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:27,052
No text, no post, nothing.

327
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:28,887
I hope she's okay.

328
00:20:31,056 --> 00:20:31,923
Okay.

329
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,660
I'll make the call.

330
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:40,132
Okay folks, I'm sorry.

331
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,070
Obviously Allison has
been missing all day.

332
00:20:45,104 --> 00:20:47,306
My wife's a little upset so

333
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:49,841
I think we're gonna
call it an evening.

334
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,776
Thanks so much for coming out.

335
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:54,079
We'll reschedule all of this.

336
00:20:55,114 --> 00:20:57,349
But thanks, thanks so much.

337
00:20:57,383 --> 00:20:59,451
Yeah, right inside there.

338
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:04,990
It'll be okay, Mrs. R.

339
00:21:05,024 --> 00:21:07,792
Allison can be a
bit crazy sometimes.

340
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:09,361
She'll be home soon.

341
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:31,984
And she hasn't called all day?

342
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:33,519
That's right.

343
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:34,954
No emails, no texts.

344
00:21:34,987 --> 00:21:36,989
Nothing, just silence.

345
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,393
She have a boyfriend?

346
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:45,998
Well I heard this
morning that she does.

347
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:46,864
What?

348
00:21:46,898 --> 00:21:48,200
And how did you
learn about this?

349
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:49,767
Does it matter?

350
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:53,272
Joanna, let's just answer
the questions please.

351
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:57,009
I heard from my best friend

352
00:21:57,042 --> 00:22:00,512
who happens to be her
best friend's mother.

353
00:22:00,546 --> 00:22:03,315
Do you have
the boyfriend's number?

354
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:05,484
No, like I said,
I just found out

355
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:07,553
that she has a boyfriend.

356
00:22:07,586 --> 00:22:08,920
I don't know anything.

357
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,489
Can we do something
more proactive?

358
00:22:10,522 --> 00:22:13,025
Do you know
the boy's name, ma'am?

359
00:22:13,058 --> 00:22:15,995
Trent or Trevor or something.

360
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:19,098
We can call Rose and ask her.

361
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,266
Well Mrs.
Riley, your daughter

362
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:23,202
hasn't been missing
a full day yet.

363
00:22:23,235 --> 00:22:25,371
Is it possible she's
off with this Trevor,

364
00:22:25,404 --> 00:22:29,275
Trent, Thomas guy and they're
off partying someplace?

365
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:31,277
And you know, just being kids?

366
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,311
No, it isn't.

367
00:22:32,344 --> 00:22:33,312
Joanna.

368
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:35,014
What?

369
00:22:35,047 --> 00:22:37,016
Yes, it's possible, officers.

370
00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:38,384
Look, whose side are you on?

371
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:41,819
There aren't any
sides here, Jo.

372
00:22:41,853 --> 00:22:44,423
Your daughter
has run away before, Ma'am.

373
00:22:44,456 --> 00:22:47,426
No, my daughter's
never run away.

374
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:49,894
Two years ago, you filed
a missing persons report-

375
00:22:49,928 --> 00:22:51,563
- No, she was at a sleepover

376
00:22:51,597 --> 00:22:53,532
and she came home
the next morning.

377
00:22:53,565 --> 00:22:56,435
So we'll just
give it a little time.

378
00:22:56,468 --> 00:22:58,604
Look, my daughter's missing!

379
00:22:58,637 --> 00:22:59,904
I know her.

380
00:22:59,938 --> 00:23:01,040
There's something terribly wrong

381
00:23:01,073 --> 00:23:03,942
and you guys are
just sitting there!

382
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,116
What do you guys
suggest we do?

383
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,584
Just give
it a little time, sir.

384
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:15,554
These things, they normally
work themselves out.

385
00:23:15,587 --> 00:23:17,389
And if they don't?

386
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:19,491
If she's still
missing after 48 hours,

387
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:20,892
give us a call.

388
00:23:20,925 --> 00:23:23,062
We'll come back,
we'll file a report.

389
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:24,463
Try to get the boyfriend's name,

390
00:23:24,496 --> 00:23:25,964
see if you can track
down his phone number.

391
00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:28,133
- Can you do that?
- Mhmm.

392
00:23:29,901 --> 00:23:34,173
They should be
easy enough for us to find.

393
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:37,343
All right guys,
thanks for coming out.

394
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:39,278
Our pleasure, sir.

395
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:41,447
- Good night, ma'am.
- Something's wrong.

396
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,581
Good night, sir.

397
00:23:42,614 --> 00:23:43,848
Good night.

398
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:50,489
I'm gonna ground that girl for a
week when she gets back.

399
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:52,458
Don't you mean if
she shows up, Case?

400
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:55,461
She hasn't texted
me either, Mom.

401
00:23:55,494 --> 00:23:57,129
Case, she's missing.

402
00:23:57,162 --> 00:23:58,530
All right.

403
00:23:58,564 --> 00:23:59,998
Don't scare her.

404
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:04,236
You're just standing there!

405
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:06,505
Rachel, go to bed.

406
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:07,373
But I...

407
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:08,607
Now.

408
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,508
Scoot.

409
00:24:14,713 --> 00:24:15,581
Okay.

410
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:20,319
I'm gonna check all
the hospitals, okay?

411
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:23,122
You keep calling her friends.

412
00:24:23,155 --> 00:24:24,223
Okay if we don't
find her tonight

413
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:26,492
I'll call Mike and Justin

414
00:24:26,525 --> 00:24:29,128
and first thing in the morning
we'll jump in our cars,

415
00:24:29,161 --> 00:24:31,397
we'll check out all the places
where the kids hang out.

416
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,398
Yeah.

417
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:33,532
Tomorrow's Saturday.

418
00:24:33,565 --> 00:24:36,001
We'll look all
weekend if we have to.

419
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:38,237
We'll track down this Trevor guy

420
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,073
who I'm going to
kill by the way.

421
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:45,711
Listen, Allison will
be back in our house

422
00:24:45,744 --> 00:24:47,946
by Sunday at the latest.

423
00:24:49,181 --> 00:24:50,048
Okay?

424
00:25:01,493 --> 00:25:02,361
Oh.

425
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:04,930
Mom.

426
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:19,311
Aight, bitches.

427
00:25:19,344 --> 00:25:21,647
Grab your coats and let's go.

428
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,350
Hurry up, we got paying
customers in there.

429
00:25:44,136 --> 00:25:46,238
It's work time now, girl.

430
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:49,107
I suppose you're
thinking about running.

431
00:25:49,141 --> 00:25:50,676
Maybe you're thinking
about asking one of them

432
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:52,544
nice white boys for help.

433
00:25:52,578 --> 00:25:55,714
Or doing something stupid
like calling the police.

434
00:25:55,747 --> 00:25:56,615
Don't.

435
00:25:57,616 --> 00:25:58,750
You see this?

436
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:09,528
That your sister, right?

437
00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:12,531
You mess with me and she next.

438
00:26:12,564 --> 00:26:13,632
No, please.

439
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:17,269
Oh she pretty too.

440
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:21,173
I'll be good.

441
00:26:23,442 --> 00:26:25,677
You're in room 45.

442
00:26:25,711 --> 00:26:28,614
I'll be out here the whole time.

443
00:26:28,647 --> 00:26:29,515
You got me

444
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,252
and I got my nine.

445
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:38,357
I got you, now.

446
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,260
Ain't nobody gonna
hurt you, girl.

447
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:44,029
Take this.

448
00:27:05,117 --> 00:27:05,784
Go on now.

449
00:27:06,718 --> 00:27:08,387
I'll be right here.

450
00:31:08,693 --> 00:31:09,594
Now what?

451
00:31:10,862 --> 00:31:13,065
Well, we go out
again tomorrow.

452
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:16,802
And if 48 hours goes by,
we call the cops again

453
00:31:16,835 --> 00:31:19,671
and file a missing
persons report.

454
00:31:19,704 --> 00:31:20,572
And um...

455
00:31:22,108 --> 00:31:23,042
And what?

456
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:25,811
Nothing.

457
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:28,780
No, don't do
that, not right now.

458
00:31:30,382 --> 00:31:31,817
All right.

459
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,985
I called Kessler.

460
00:31:33,019 --> 00:31:34,686
Oh god.

461
00:31:34,719 --> 00:31:36,788
Who's Kessler?

462
00:31:36,822 --> 00:31:38,490
Case's idiot
friend from college.

463
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:39,691
He's a loser.

464
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:41,393
He's actually
quite successful.

465
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:43,996
He's a professional poker
player and he sells weed.

466
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:47,934
He's one of those guys with a
22 year old bimbo girlfriend.

467
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:50,102
Is any of that
relevant, Joanna?

468
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:51,103
He knows people.

469
00:31:51,137 --> 00:31:52,404
Really?

470
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:54,439
Who does he know, huh?

471
00:31:54,472 --> 00:31:57,375
Who does your pothead
poker playing friend know?

472
00:31:57,409 --> 00:31:58,410
Never mind.

473
00:31:58,443 --> 00:32:00,612
I didn't wanna get into it.

474
00:32:06,085 --> 00:32:08,553
Just tell me who he knows.

475
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:19,999
Belton Private Investigators.

476
00:32:20,032 --> 00:32:23,735
Kessler says this PI,
John Belton and his crew

477
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:26,504
will find Allison or die trying.

478
00:33:05,945 --> 00:33:06,811
John.

479
00:33:07,846 --> 00:33:10,582
You can't save every one of 'em.

480
00:33:16,088 --> 00:33:17,422
Sorry, guys.

481
00:33:20,592 --> 00:33:22,661
It wasn't your fault.

482
00:33:22,694 --> 00:33:25,830
You tracked the kid
down, you found him.

483
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:27,133
That's your job.

484
00:33:30,735 --> 00:33:33,471
I couldn't have done any better.

485
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:55,527
All we can do is get
back on that horse, boss.

486
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,701
Belton Private Investigators.

487
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:04,569
John Belton speaking.

488
00:34:10,009 --> 00:34:12,044
All right, Mr. Riley.

489
00:34:12,078 --> 00:34:15,247
How long has she been missing?

490
00:34:15,281 --> 00:34:18,084
Have you called the police?

491
00:34:21,954 --> 00:34:23,255
No, no, no, tomorrow
might be too late, okay?

492
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:25,890
I'm sending my to investigator
out to speak to you.

493
00:34:25,924 --> 00:34:27,126
We'll conference on the speaker.

494
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:29,861
Can I have your address please?

495
00:34:33,265 --> 00:34:34,133
Yes, sir.

496
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:38,870
Clock's ticking.

497
00:35:01,327 --> 00:35:04,296
Hey, she
broke in well tonight.

498
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:06,065
Have a seat, ladies.

499
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,904
Honey, you done good.

500
00:35:14,806 --> 00:35:17,842
I know the first time's
always the toughest.

501
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:19,045
Daddy?

502
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:20,812
Huh, baby?

503
00:35:20,845 --> 00:35:23,681
Am I still your favorite?

504
00:35:23,715 --> 00:35:24,582
You is.

505
00:35:26,218 --> 00:35:27,153
You all is.

506
00:35:46,372 --> 00:35:48,706
John, she's 16.

507
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,676
Blonde, 5'3, photos
are on the way.

508
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,080
Okay, got it.

509
00:35:54,113 --> 00:35:55,680
Listen, Mr. And Mrs. Riley,

510
00:35:55,713 --> 00:35:57,283
the police won't consider
this a missing persons issue

511
00:35:57,316 --> 00:35:59,285
until 48 hours has elapsed.

512
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:01,220
That means that if your
daughter does not return

513
00:36:01,253 --> 00:36:04,290
you will fill out the
necessary police report.

514
00:36:04,323 --> 00:36:06,025
Okay, got it.

515
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:07,725
All right, Tex, go
up to the girl's room.

516
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:08,961
Toss it.

517
00:36:08,994 --> 00:36:11,763
Mr. And Mrs. Riley, he's gonna
look for another cell phone,

518
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:14,799
iPad, laptop, and
address book, a journal,

519
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:15,935
anything like that.

520
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,069
I'm on it, boss.

521
00:36:17,103 --> 00:36:18,370
I'll show you.

522
00:36:21,073 --> 00:36:22,241
Mrs. Riley.

523
00:36:22,274 --> 00:36:23,708
We're gonna do this
by the numbers, ma'am.

524
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:24,944
Okay, my team and I
are gonna question

525
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:27,012
everyone that Allison knows.

526
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:29,281
You're in very good hands.

527
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:31,383
Thank you, Mr. Belton.

528
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:33,818
And call me John, please.

529
00:36:33,852 --> 00:36:34,987
I hope this doesn't happen

530
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,689
but we may be together
for a little while.

531
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:39,358
Well then no more Mrs. Riley.

532
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:41,327
It's Joanna and Case.

533
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,962
Okay, Joanna.

534
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:45,197
Now I know the police may
have asked you this before

535
00:36:45,231 --> 00:36:46,932
but does your daughter
have any issues

536
00:36:46,966 --> 00:36:48,666
with drugs or alcohol?

537
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,834
No.

538
00:36:49,868 --> 00:36:51,003
You're sure?

539
00:36:51,036 --> 00:36:53,038
Yeah, I mean I may have
missed with the boyfriend part

540
00:36:53,072 --> 00:36:54,873
but I know her really well.

541
00:36:54,906 --> 00:36:56,275
She's not into that.

542
00:36:56,308 --> 00:36:57,343
Okay.

543
00:36:57,376 --> 00:37:00,412
Any past psychological
issues, ADD,

544
00:37:00,446 --> 00:37:02,248
depression, anything like that?

545
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:05,117
No, not at all,
she's a great girl.

546
00:37:05,151 --> 00:37:08,653
She's a sweetheart,
she's an angel, John.

547
00:37:09,355 --> 00:37:11,257
I'm sure she is, Joanna

548
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,892
and we are gonna
find your angel.

549
00:37:13,925 --> 00:37:15,995
Do you promise?

550
00:37:22,468 --> 00:37:24,036
I promise.

551
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:25,670
She will be found.

552
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,793
Laptop, old cellphone.

553
00:37:51,197 --> 00:37:54,934
I'm sorry, what
was your name again?

554
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:56,235
That is Aaron.

555
00:37:57,769 --> 00:37:59,405
Write down the
name of her horse.

556
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:03,108
Any other pets, middle
name, best friends' names,

557
00:38:03,142 --> 00:38:05,211
favorite colors,
favorite numbers,

558
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:08,846
celebrity crushes,
birthday, favorite holiday

559
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,418
and everything else
that you can think of.

560
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:16,788
Hey, he'll have her
passwords in 15 minutes.

561
00:38:16,821 --> 00:38:21,160
Me, I can barely find the
speaker button on my phone.

562
00:38:23,395 --> 00:38:24,530
How do you take your coffee?

563
00:38:24,563 --> 00:38:25,431
Hot.

564
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:35,074
Look, we're gonna
find your daughter.

565
00:38:35,107 --> 00:38:36,741
This is what we do.

566
00:38:38,143 --> 00:38:39,011
John.

567
00:38:40,512 --> 00:38:43,915
How much is this gonna cost us?

568
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:45,951
We're middle class.

569
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:47,953
We're not rich.

570
00:38:47,987 --> 00:38:49,255
There's a standard
commencement retainer

571
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:50,888
of 20,000 tonight.

572
00:38:52,224 --> 00:38:53,993
Even if she walks in that
door 10 minutes from now

573
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:54,560
on her own.

574
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:56,228
Whoah.

575
00:38:56,262 --> 00:38:57,129
Fine.

576
00:38:58,397 --> 00:39:01,533
And then it's 20k
a week after that.

577
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:02,867
John, I don't know.

578
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,768
Case.

579
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:10,009
I'm just trying to
be practical, honey.

580
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:12,044
We're talking about the
girls' college funds here.

581
00:39:12,077 --> 00:39:16,248
We don't need college if
we don't have our daughter.

582
00:39:16,282 --> 00:39:18,050
Maybe we should
just think about it.

583
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,218
Let the police try.

584
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:20,852
Look, sir.

585
00:39:20,885 --> 00:39:22,221
I'm not trying to
sell you on this,

586
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:25,457
but the police, they're
just not gonna do anything.

587
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:27,293
That's just the long
and short of it.

588
00:39:27,326 --> 00:39:30,129
Yeah, maybe she's
with this boyfriend.

589
00:39:30,162 --> 00:39:31,597
Are you sure?

590
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,032
No.

591
00:39:33,065 --> 00:39:35,567
I'm not sure of anything now.

592
00:39:35,601 --> 00:39:37,902
And that is the hell of it.

593
00:39:37,936 --> 00:39:41,540
Maybe Allison is doing a
Juliet thing with her guy.

594
00:39:41,573 --> 00:39:43,808
But then again maybe not.

595
00:39:46,278 --> 00:39:49,181
Can we just have
time to think about it?

596
00:39:49,214 --> 00:39:50,582
Honestly sir,
every minute counts

597
00:39:50,616 --> 00:39:53,052
and we are on the clock.

598
00:39:53,085 --> 00:39:54,253
You want us to
find your daughter

599
00:39:54,286 --> 00:39:56,488
we need to start right now.

600
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,857
I'll pay for it.

601
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,493
Mom, your retirement.

602
00:40:01,527 --> 00:40:04,063
How can I retire
without my granddaughter?

603
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,397
Barbara, we can't accept.

604
00:40:05,431 --> 00:40:07,933
You don't have to accept.

605
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:10,202
Mr. Belton, you're hired.

606
00:40:10,235 --> 00:40:14,039
Computer nerd, keep
doing what you're doing.

607
00:40:14,073 --> 00:40:16,208
You, Cowboy, get
me the paperwork.

608
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:17,042
Yes ma'am.

609
00:40:19,478 --> 00:40:21,313
You'll have your
money wired to you

610
00:40:21,347 --> 00:40:25,017
as soon as the bank
opens tomorrow morning.

611
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:28,253
Find my granddaughter!

612
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:29,154
I will.

613
00:40:31,256 --> 00:40:32,124
Mom.

614
00:40:43,635 --> 00:40:46,138
Where are you, pretty girl?

615
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:51,243
I just hope it's not
where I'm afraid you are.

616
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:17,463
Well, did you enjoy
church today, baby?

617
00:42:17,496 --> 00:42:18,630
It was cool.

618
00:42:19,631 --> 00:42:22,067
You're such a nice boy.

619
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,002
You pick your grandma up,

620
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:25,571
you take me to church.

621
00:42:25,604 --> 00:42:27,339
It ain't no thing.

622
00:42:28,707 --> 00:42:32,010
The Lord was good giving
me a grandchild like you.

623
00:42:32,044 --> 00:42:34,513
I told you, I got you, Grams.

624
00:42:41,253 --> 00:42:43,489
All right, honey.

625
00:42:56,568 --> 00:42:57,503
Yo Grams.

626
00:42:59,438 --> 00:43:03,275
I put a little something
in your purse for you.

627
00:43:04,776 --> 00:43:06,378
Oh, no, child!

628
00:43:06,411 --> 00:43:08,580
I can't take no money from you.

629
00:43:08,614 --> 00:43:10,148
I'll see you next week.

630
00:43:10,182 --> 00:43:12,384
Go on in there now.

631
00:43:12,417 --> 00:43:13,285
Bye.

632
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:15,521
Drive careful.

633
00:43:35,173 --> 00:43:36,041
Okay.

634
00:43:37,175 --> 00:43:41,547
Our mission is one Allison
Riley, age 16 as of Friday.

635
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,148
Now missing for almost 48 hours,

636
00:43:43,181 --> 00:43:46,685
she'll be an official
missing person as of tonight.

637
00:43:46,718 --> 00:43:49,154
Sweet little thing.

638
00:43:49,187 --> 00:43:50,422
No call from the
parents this morning?

639
00:43:50,455 --> 00:43:51,490
No, not so far.

640
00:43:51,523 --> 00:43:54,159
I am working on the supposition
that she is a taken.

641
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:56,094
I'm betting I would say
she's with the boyfriend.

642
00:43:56,128 --> 00:43:57,496
Yeah, yeah, I know that but

643
00:43:57,529 --> 00:43:59,431
I just don't think so.

644
00:43:59,464 --> 00:44:00,832
That damn nose of
yours again, boss?

645
00:44:00,866 --> 00:44:02,401
It's a curse, but yeah.

646
00:44:02,434 --> 00:44:03,835
I got a bad feeling on this one.

647
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:06,171
Aaron, tell them what you know.

648
00:44:06,204 --> 00:44:08,840
Her boyfriend Tyler is
a typical catfish profile.

649
00:44:08,874 --> 00:44:11,677
Tyler is actually Ryan Mcnaff.

650
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,478
Professional model out of LA.

651
00:44:13,512 --> 00:44:16,715
All the photos were taken
from his various sites.

652
00:44:16,748 --> 00:44:18,717
The cellphone that was
used to text Allison

653
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,853
went dark at 11:05
p.m. Friday night.

654
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,556
And I presume it'll
never be turned on again.

655
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:26,658
Trace down Tyler's cellphone.

656
00:44:26,692 --> 00:44:28,427
I'm guessing it's
prepaid with cash.

657
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:30,395
We might get lucky.

658
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:32,731
Okay, Karen, get in touch
with this Ryan Mcnaff

659
00:44:32,764 --> 00:44:34,299
out in California.

660
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,134
The odds are overwhelming
that he has no idea

661
00:44:36,168 --> 00:44:37,569
any of this is going on.

662
00:44:37,603 --> 00:44:39,738
But make him prove to you that
he was in L.A. this weekend.

663
00:44:39,771 --> 00:44:40,806
Will do.

664
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:42,341
All right, Maggie.

665
00:44:42,374 --> 00:44:44,843
The Rileys go to
church at Vineyard.

666
00:44:44,876 --> 00:44:46,511
And they have a lot
of friends there.

667
00:44:46,545 --> 00:44:47,346
Yeah, I know it.

668
00:44:47,379 --> 00:44:48,347
It's a nice place.

669
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,748
All right, good.

670
00:44:49,781 --> 00:44:51,750
Well then make inquiries as
only you can, church lady.

671
00:44:51,783 --> 00:44:53,218
Oh, getting paid
to go to church.

672
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:54,519
The Lord is good.

673
00:44:54,553 --> 00:44:55,420
Mhmm.

674
00:44:56,956 --> 00:44:59,424
All right Ben, hit the
high school tomorrow.

675
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:01,159
See if you can get her
friends to tell you things

676
00:45:01,193 --> 00:45:02,527
that they won't
tell their parents.

677
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:04,763
So you're telling me to
hit on high school girls?

678
00:45:04,796 --> 00:45:07,499
I'm telling you to
go there, be charming

679
00:45:07,532 --> 00:45:09,368
and then leave.

680
00:45:09,401 --> 00:45:11,670
Man, I want a case
at a college campus.

681
00:45:11,703 --> 00:45:13,238
Yeah, I bet you do.

682
00:45:13,271 --> 00:45:15,440
Biggs, head down to
the usual hotspots.

683
00:45:15,474 --> 00:45:18,343
See if you can get any
chatter out of the community.

684
00:45:18,377 --> 00:45:20,245
I'ma be working the
homies all day, Captain.

685
00:45:20,278 --> 00:45:22,247
Karen, when you're done
with that model in L.A.,

686
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,249
hit up the various shops
and the street corners.

687
00:45:24,282 --> 00:45:26,284
See if the working
girls know anything.

688
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:27,919
Why do I always
get hooker detail?

689
00:45:27,954 --> 00:45:31,189
What are we gonna
do, put heels on Ben now?

690
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:34,159
Rookie.

691
00:45:37,896 --> 00:45:40,265
All right, Ben, you
actually go with her.

692
00:45:40,298 --> 00:45:41,700
Hang back but not too far.

693
00:45:41,733 --> 00:45:43,769
Her safety is
number one, got it?

694
00:45:43,802 --> 00:45:45,337
Yes sir.

695
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:47,940
Now guys, if our little
girl here is a taken,

696
00:45:47,974 --> 00:45:50,275
every minute is an enemy.

697
00:45:51,443 --> 00:45:52,678
Okay, we're on the
clock, let's do this.

698
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:53,578
Come on.

699
00:46:44,663 --> 00:46:46,698
Well, our brothers
and sisters in Christ,

700
00:46:46,732 --> 00:46:49,501
the Riley family are going
through a tough time right now.

701
00:46:49,534 --> 00:46:52,504
Many of you know that Allison's
been missing for some time.

702
00:46:52,537 --> 00:46:55,741
And we wanna pray for
God's healing and comfort

703
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:58,443
to come in their lives
during this difficult season.

704
00:46:58,477 --> 00:46:59,644
So let's pray.

705
00:46:59,678 --> 00:47:03,415
Jesus, we ask that
you would be with our

706
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:04,649
brothers and sisters.

707
00:47:04,683 --> 00:47:06,618
We pray that you
would comfort them

708
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:08,887
during this difficult season.

709
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,524
And we pray that you would
help to bring recovery

710
00:47:12,557 --> 00:47:15,527
for this young
woman who's missing.

711
00:47:16,661 --> 00:47:17,964
We pray Lord that
justice would come

712
00:47:17,997 --> 00:47:19,765
into this situation.

713
00:47:19,798 --> 00:47:22,501
Would you help and
bless and comfort

714
00:47:22,534 --> 00:47:23,869
and encourage this family,

715
00:47:23,902 --> 00:47:26,538
and help us Lord to be a
blessing of support to them.

716
00:47:26,571 --> 00:47:28,774
In your name we pray, amen.

717
00:47:54,866 --> 00:47:56,401
What's up, big man?

718
00:47:56,434 --> 00:47:57,536
Looking for a girl, cuz.

719
00:47:57,569 --> 00:47:58,703
Girl?

720
00:47:58,737 --> 00:48:00,338
You gotta tell me
what you want, man.

721
00:48:00,372 --> 00:48:02,507
White girl, about 16.

722
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:04,743
Man.

723
00:48:04,776 --> 00:48:05,610
Oh she cute though.

724
00:48:05,644 --> 00:48:06,478
See that?

725
00:48:06,511 --> 00:48:07,679
She cool, bro.

726
00:48:07,712 --> 00:48:08,547
Yeah she nice.

727
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,781
Yeah, she bangin, man.

728
00:48:09,815 --> 00:48:10,715
She a ho?

729
00:48:10,749 --> 00:48:11,917
Might be.

730
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:13,418
A brother remember
a girl like that.

731
00:48:13,451 --> 00:48:14,619
Suburban girl.

732
00:48:14,653 --> 00:48:16,855
Suburban girl, of
course, of course.

733
00:48:16,888 --> 00:48:18,590
Yeah, that's why you be down
here slumming with us huh?

734
00:48:18,623 --> 00:48:20,392
That's why you be down
here all the time.

735
00:48:20,425 --> 00:48:21,459
Her daddy must be rich, huh?

736
00:48:21,493 --> 00:48:22,894
Huh, yeah, that's right.

737
00:48:22,929 --> 00:48:24,729
Hey, spread some of
that love around here.

738
00:48:24,763 --> 00:48:26,132
Share the wealth.

739
00:48:26,165 --> 00:48:29,101
Tell me where the girl at,
then you get paid, aight?

740
00:48:29,135 --> 00:48:31,403
I'll give you five Gs
you tell me where she at.

741
00:48:31,436 --> 00:48:34,840
I'll give you 10 Gs you
bring her to me, aight?

742
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:36,075
All right man, I got your
phone.

743
00:48:36,108 --> 00:48:37,409
It's got to be verified,
aight?

744
00:48:37,442 --> 00:48:38,577
I got your phone.

745
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:41,847
Aight, aight, aight, make
it happen for me, baby aight?

746
00:48:53,592 --> 00:48:55,894
The Detective handling this
matter will be Jack Carson.

747
00:48:55,927 --> 00:48:58,730
He's a good man, he
walked a beat in his day.

748
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:00,099
That's fine.

749
00:49:00,132 --> 00:49:02,868
Yeah we hired a
private investigator too.

750
00:49:02,901 --> 00:49:05,637
Well that may have
been premature, sir.

751
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:06,538
We didn't think so.

752
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,875
Do you mind if I
asked who you engaged?

753
00:49:09,908 --> 00:49:10,909
John Belton.

754
00:49:14,646 --> 00:49:15,580
What?

755
00:49:15,614 --> 00:49:17,883
He seemed very professional.

756
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:19,684
Professional?

757
00:49:19,718 --> 00:49:21,653
Officer
Helsdon, just..

758
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:23,990
Wait, what about him?

759
00:49:25,091 --> 00:49:26,925
Well, he, let's just say

760
00:49:26,959 --> 00:49:29,494
he likes to work
outside the box.

761
00:49:29,527 --> 00:49:31,496
He's not exactly orthodox.

762
00:49:31,529 --> 00:49:33,798
We'll that sounds
exactly like what we need.

763
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:37,702
We're gonna find your
daughter, Mrs. Riley.

764
00:49:37,736 --> 00:49:40,139
Now having John Belton talking
to the same people we are

765
00:49:40,172 --> 00:49:41,706
is only gonna get in our way.

766
00:50:01,826 --> 00:50:03,728
Unbelievable,
unbelievable.

767
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:12,871
Case, what is that?

768
00:50:12,904 --> 00:50:13,738
What's what?

769
00:50:14,673 --> 00:50:16,708
That thing on your hip.

770
00:50:19,678 --> 00:50:20,912
It's a gun, Barbara.

771
00:50:20,947 --> 00:50:22,949
Please don't ask me
rhetorical questions.

772
00:50:22,982 --> 00:50:24,616
I don't have the energy for it.

773
00:50:28,054 --> 00:50:29,821
Why are you wearing it?

774
00:50:29,854 --> 00:50:30,822
Case.

775
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:34,926
Because the second
amendment says I can

776
00:50:34,961 --> 00:50:36,128
so I am.

777
00:50:36,162 --> 00:50:37,796
Can we just leave it
at that and drop it?

778
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:38,863
We're not gun people.

779
00:50:38,897 --> 00:50:40,699
Well I just became gun people.

780
00:50:42,034 --> 00:50:44,971
Do you have any
idea how many gun-related deaths

781
00:50:45,004 --> 00:50:46,571
there are in the US alone?

782
00:50:46,604 --> 00:50:48,040
Barbara, this
is not just some debate

783
00:50:48,074 --> 00:50:49,607
at one of your
liberal arts colleges.

784
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:51,576
My daughter's missing.

785
00:50:51,609 --> 00:50:53,946
My
granddaughter is missing.

786
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:56,082
Don't take that tone with me!

787
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:56,949
Case.

788
00:50:59,085 --> 00:51:00,719
You have to see this.

789
00:51:00,752 --> 00:51:01,586
What?

790
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:02,687
Captain John Belton,

791
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:05,857
US Marine Corps,
dishonorable discharge.

792
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:08,227
Says here he disobeyed
a direct order

793
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,628
in the line of combat.

794
00:51:10,662 --> 00:51:12,031
He's been in and out of rehab

795
00:51:12,064 --> 00:51:14,066
for alcoholism three times!

796
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,135
No wonder why your
friend Kessler knows him.

797
00:51:16,168 --> 00:51:17,836
None of that matters, Jo.

798
00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:19,238
He's looking for Allison.

799
00:51:19,271 --> 00:51:20,805
Is he?

800
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:23,875
Or is he just drinking
away my money in some bar?

801
00:51:23,908 --> 00:51:25,211
Stay out of this, Barbara.

802
00:51:25,244 --> 00:51:27,046
Don't you tell me
to stay out of this.

803
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:28,747
I'm paying the
bills around here.

804
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:31,150
And strutting around
like John Wayne

805
00:51:31,183 --> 00:51:33,752
isn't doing anybody any good.

806
00:51:33,785 --> 00:51:36,721
Why would we trust
your friend Kessler, why?

807
00:51:36,755 --> 00:51:38,857
How the hell was
I supposed to know?

808
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,592
This is all happening so fast!

809
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:41,659
Where are you going?

810
00:51:41,693 --> 00:51:42,894
Out, looking!

811
00:51:42,927 --> 00:51:44,863
And standing around here
isn't doing us any good!

812
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:46,065
Where?

813
00:51:46,098 --> 00:51:47,299
I don't know!

814
00:52:11,623 --> 00:52:12,992
Girls.

815
00:52:13,025 --> 00:52:14,626
Go to class.

816
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:15,927
The bell hasn't rang yet.

817
00:52:16,996 --> 00:52:18,797
Sir, I'm a
private investigator

818
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:20,099
- for John-
- One moment.

819
00:52:20,132 --> 00:52:21,067
Now, ladies.

820
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:24,869
You're aware you have
a girl missing, Allison.

821
00:52:24,903 --> 00:52:26,338
Yes, I'm well aware.

822
00:52:26,372 --> 00:52:28,340
We're all well aware.

823
00:52:28,374 --> 00:52:31,377
That's why the city employs
a Police Department.

824
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,113
We don't need wannabes
scaring the children.

825
00:52:34,146 --> 00:52:35,214
Wannabe?

826
00:52:35,247 --> 00:52:37,049
Sir, I served two tours of duty

827
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:38,250
with the United States-

828
00:52:38,284 --> 00:52:41,619
- Yes, yes, yes, spare
me your resume, okay?

829
00:52:41,653 --> 00:52:42,854
Find your own way out.

830
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:48,360
Let the police do their job.

831
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,241
Just one guy tonight.

832
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:04,376
You like that?

833
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:08,047
Pay 1500 for three hours.

834
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,814
Easy money.

835
00:53:09,848 --> 00:53:12,118
Just sit there, listen
to him talk about he job

836
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:13,751
and all that nonsense.

837
00:53:16,855 --> 00:53:19,258
Ain't like them other
ones at the motel.

838
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:21,926
He wants you to think
you he girlfriend, see?

839
00:53:21,961 --> 00:53:24,296
Do good and it stay like this.

840
00:53:25,131 --> 00:53:27,066
You act like a cheap ho,
you go back to the motel.

841
00:53:27,099 --> 00:53:29,801
10, 20 men a day
for a hundred a pop.

842
00:53:30,269 --> 00:53:31,137
Feel me?

843
00:53:33,973 --> 00:53:36,375
And remember, you don't
want me to come visit

844
00:53:36,408 --> 00:53:38,410
your little sister now, do you?

845
00:53:38,444 --> 00:53:40,812
No.

846
00:53:57,096 --> 00:53:58,364
Go on girl.

847
00:53:58,397 --> 00:53:59,797
Make Daddy proud.

848
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:15,080
Honey.

849
00:54:16,315 --> 00:54:17,849
Try to get some sleep.

850
00:54:33,465 --> 00:54:34,333
- Hi.
- Hi.

851
00:54:40,838 --> 00:54:42,174
You really are beautiful.

852
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:45,344
Want a glass of
wine, sweetheart?

853
00:54:45,377 --> 00:54:46,245
Thank you.

854
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,728
You're hot.

855
00:55:05,397 --> 00:55:06,432
I mean, handsome.

856
00:55:09,401 --> 00:55:10,402
I'll take both.

857
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:18,843
What's your name, angel?

858
00:55:18,876 --> 00:55:19,511
Allison.

859
00:55:45,237 --> 00:55:46,771
So, Allison.

860
00:55:48,873 --> 00:55:50,542
Tell me something
about yourself.

861
00:55:54,313 --> 00:55:55,314
I'm in vet school

862
00:55:56,348 --> 00:55:58,350
working specifically
with horses.

863
00:56:02,087 --> 00:56:02,920
Horses?

864
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:04,957
Why horses?

865
00:56:06,558 --> 00:56:09,295
Right before my 16th birthday,

866
00:56:09,328 --> 00:56:10,929
I went riding with my friends

867
00:56:12,298 --> 00:56:14,866
and I knew right then that I
wanted to be a veterinarian.

868
00:56:18,504 --> 00:56:19,804
Brains and beauty.

869
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,345
Wanna do me a favor, Allison?

870
00:56:29,448 --> 00:56:30,282
Sure.

871
00:56:33,986 --> 00:56:35,287
Take off that dress

872
00:56:35,321 --> 00:56:36,821
so we can go have some fun.

873
00:56:47,399 --> 00:56:50,336
Why don't you
take it off for me?

874
00:57:35,614 --> 00:57:36,648
Talk to me, John.

875
00:57:36,682 --> 00:57:39,485
I need to hear
something good, please.

876
00:57:39,518 --> 00:57:40,652
Just spoke to Ted Carson,

877
00:57:40,686 --> 00:57:42,421
the Detective on Allison's case.

878
00:57:42,454 --> 00:57:45,257
So we have the eyes of
Bloomfield Hills PD on this

879
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:46,258
as well as us,

880
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:47,659
but I'm gonna be
honest with you.

881
00:57:47,693 --> 00:57:50,362
The odds that she's still
in the suburbs are slim.

882
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:53,132
I've made calls to my
friends at Detroit PD,

883
00:57:53,165 --> 00:57:54,933
they know about her
and they have her photo

884
00:57:54,967 --> 00:57:56,402
but honestly, they
are overwhelmed

885
00:57:56,435 --> 00:57:57,569
with their own problems.

886
00:57:58,971 --> 00:58:00,372
Is that it?

887
00:58:01,707 --> 00:58:03,675
Well I have a man on
the street in Detroit.

888
00:58:03,709 --> 00:58:06,378
Everybody knows him,
everybody respects him.

889
00:58:06,412 --> 00:58:07,513
The word is out to all the gangs

890
00:58:07,546 --> 00:58:11,650
that they can get 10 grand
if they find your daughter.

891
00:58:11,683 --> 00:58:13,085
Now Aaron is working
the computer.

892
00:58:13,118 --> 00:58:14,353
He hasn't found her yet.

893
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:17,156
Sometimes the pimps-

894
00:58:17,189 --> 00:58:18,056
- Pimps?

895
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,630
I'm sorry, Case, but
we have to face reality.

896
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:30,669
Oh God in heaven.

897
00:58:30,702 --> 00:58:32,371
Maybe...

898
00:58:32,404 --> 00:58:34,273
Maybe you don't want
all the details.

899
00:58:37,409 --> 00:58:39,311
I want every detail, John.

900
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:41,079
Go on.

901
00:58:44,249 --> 00:58:45,651
There haven't
been any escort ads

902
00:58:45,684 --> 00:58:48,587
that match any of the photos
from her social media sites.

903
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,256
Aaron's run them all
through the computer.

904
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:53,325
Okay next he's checking
for similar photos

905
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:55,360
but that has to be done by hand

906
00:58:55,394 --> 00:58:57,162
and it takes a lot longer.

907
00:59:00,566 --> 00:59:01,366
Is that it?

908
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:03,969
Well the noose is
tightening, Case.

909
00:59:05,103 --> 00:59:06,205
But that's all I have for now.

910
00:59:08,507 --> 00:59:09,641
Thank you, John.

911
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:12,711
Hey, how is Joanna?

912
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:19,051
Things at home
are not good, John.

913
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:21,620
Okay, well that's normal.

914
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:25,290
You two hang in there
now, you need each other.

915
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:28,260
I know.

916
00:59:28,293 --> 00:59:29,161
Thank you, John.

917
00:59:31,063 --> 00:59:32,531
All right, we'll
talk tomorrow.

918
00:59:34,132 --> 00:59:35,000
Yeah.

919
01:00:23,749 --> 01:00:24,783
One week!

920
01:00:24,816 --> 01:00:27,419
One week, people
and we got zero.

921
01:00:27,452 --> 01:00:29,288
Zilch, nada, nothing, come on!

922
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:30,856
It ain't unusual, boss.

923
01:00:30,889 --> 01:00:32,257
Yeah,
Captain, you know that.

924
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:33,458
Yeah I know it,
but I don't like it.

925
01:00:33,492 --> 01:00:35,460
Okay usually there's some sort
of something in the ether,

926
01:00:35,494 --> 01:00:37,329
some chatter, some
talk on the streets.

927
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:38,196
We got nothing.

928
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,164
There will be, boss.

929
01:00:39,197 --> 01:00:40,599
There will be, sooner or later.

930
01:00:40,632 --> 01:00:42,301
Aaron!

931
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:44,436
Searching social
media for any profiles

932
01:00:44,469 --> 01:00:45,837
using Tyler's picture.

933
01:00:45,871 --> 01:00:47,439
Nothing yet.

934
01:00:47,472 --> 01:00:50,542
Whoever this guy is that
lured Allison out is smart.

935
01:00:50,576 --> 01:00:52,244
But I'll find him!

936
01:00:52,277 --> 01:00:53,845
Yeah, you better find him.

937
01:00:53,879 --> 01:00:55,614
Karen, my office.

938
01:00:57,149 --> 01:00:57,783
Come on.

939
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:05,090
Karen, get in here.

940
01:01:13,532 --> 01:01:16,735
$20,000 check from
the mother-in-law.

941
01:01:19,805 --> 01:01:20,706
What have you got?

942
01:01:20,739 --> 01:01:21,907
Nothing, not a peep.

943
01:01:21,941 --> 01:01:23,875
Our pros have heard
zero on our girl.

944
01:01:23,909 --> 01:01:25,844
Right, tomorrow you
start talking to everyone.

945
01:01:25,877 --> 01:01:26,712
Who?

946
01:01:26,745 --> 01:01:28,447
Everyone!

947
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,881
Okay, their kids
are gonna trust you.

948
01:01:29,915 --> 01:01:31,416
Her friends will trust you.

949
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:32,918
I want you to call every
single phone number

950
01:01:32,952 --> 01:01:34,620
in her entire phone.

951
01:01:34,653 --> 01:01:35,821
Got it?

952
01:01:35,854 --> 01:01:37,456
Got it.

953
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:38,357
Rookie, where's the rookie?

954
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:39,558
Tell him to get in here.

955
01:01:40,459 --> 01:01:42,761
Yo, Benjamin, let's go!

956
01:01:42,794 --> 01:01:43,862
Front and center, son.

957
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:45,864
Sir?

958
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:48,667
All right, I want you
to coordinate with PD.

959
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,735
I want you to give
me every location

960
01:01:49,768 --> 01:01:51,938
that every kid has been
picked up in the last year.

961
01:01:51,971 --> 01:01:53,338
Every single one.

962
01:01:53,372 --> 01:01:54,539
On it.

963
01:01:54,573 --> 01:01:55,874
Get me some leads,
people, let's go!

964
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:04,916
You need to get
some sleep, Captain.

965
01:02:04,951 --> 01:02:06,885
Can't keep pulling
these all nighters.

966
01:02:08,286 --> 01:02:09,354
We ain't kids anymore.

967
01:02:10,756 --> 01:02:12,658
I can sleep when
I'm dead, partner.

968
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:19,197
But I will take a cup of coffee.

969
01:02:24,903 --> 01:02:25,837
Where are you, kid?

970
01:02:38,283 --> 01:02:39,685
Everybody get up.

971
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:41,553
We going for a ride.

972
01:02:41,586 --> 01:02:42,788
Ain't no working today.

973
01:03:10,016 --> 01:03:11,550
No, I don't know.

974
01:03:13,552 --> 01:03:15,687
I don't know.

975
01:03:16,621 --> 01:03:18,356
I gotta go okay, I love you.

976
01:03:19,891 --> 01:03:20,892
You did good.

977
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:25,330
Allison, you up.

978
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:35,307
Allison!

979
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:36,008
Allison!

980
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:39,478
Hi, Mom.

981
01:03:40,645 --> 01:03:41,513
Where are you?

982
01:03:42,814 --> 01:03:43,849
Everything's okay.

983
01:03:44,783 --> 01:03:49,021
Mom, I'm in Chicago with Tyler.

984
01:03:49,055 --> 01:03:51,023
Honey, just come home.

985
01:03:51,057 --> 01:03:52,824
We are not angry with you.

986
01:03:52,858 --> 01:03:54,259
Just please, come home.

987
01:04:00,933 --> 01:04:01,934
I have to go.

988
01:04:01,968 --> 01:04:02,801
Bye.

989
01:04:02,834 --> 01:04:03,635
What?

990
01:04:03,668 --> 01:04:05,470
No, Allison.

991
01:04:05,504 --> 01:04:07,006
Hello, Allison?

992
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:08,074
No.

993
01:04:08,107 --> 01:04:09,041
- Allison?
- It's disconnected.

994
01:04:09,075 --> 01:04:10,609
- Allison!
- Call back.

995
01:04:13,612 --> 01:04:14,981
Hey there,
it's Allison's phone.

996
01:04:15,014 --> 01:04:15,914
- Oh my god.
- Dammit!

997
01:04:15,948 --> 01:04:18,683
- We traced her cellphone.
- Is that legal?

998
01:04:18,717 --> 01:04:20,719
No, it's not. Do you have a
problem with that?

999
01:04:20,752 --> 01:04:22,054
Not in the least, go on.

1000
01:04:22,088 --> 01:04:24,389
And the call did
come from Chicago.

1001
01:04:24,422 --> 01:04:26,358
Yeah she's in Chicago
with her boyfriend.

1002
01:04:26,391 --> 01:04:27,093
Maybe.

1003
01:04:27,126 --> 01:04:29,694
I hope so, but I don't think so.

1004
01:04:30,862 --> 01:04:32,031
But she said that she was-

1005
01:04:32,064 --> 01:04:33,933
- Joanna, please, just let,

1006
01:04:33,966 --> 01:04:36,501
please, will you
just let him speak?

1007
01:04:36,535 --> 01:04:38,971
The cellphone went dark
right after the call.

1008
01:04:39,005 --> 01:04:42,975
Allison may have been coerced
into making that phone call.

1009
01:04:43,009 --> 01:04:46,078
I'm sorry, but it's a
very real possibility.

1010
01:04:46,112 --> 01:04:48,346
What?

1011
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:49,681
No, why, she wouldn't...

1012
01:04:49,714 --> 01:04:51,083
- No.
- When these girls are taken,

1013
01:04:51,117 --> 01:04:53,986
Joanna, the bad guys make
the kids call the parents.

1014
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:56,055
It's protocol to
throw off the police.

1015
01:04:57,056 --> 01:04:58,057
I'm telling you, she's fine.

1016
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:00,492
She's in Chicago and she's okay.

1017
01:05:00,525 --> 01:05:02,094
She's with her
boyfriend, she's okay.

1018
01:05:02,128 --> 01:05:03,728
There is no boyfriend.

1019
01:05:06,098 --> 01:05:07,066
What?

1020
01:05:07,099 --> 01:05:08,834
At least there doesn't
seem to be a real Tyler.

1021
01:05:08,867 --> 01:05:10,569
Those pictures are fake.

1022
01:05:10,602 --> 01:05:13,438
They're from some
model in Los Angeles.

1023
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,473
The entire profile is a catfish.

1024
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:18,010
What?

1025
01:05:18,044 --> 01:05:19,377
Whoever lured
your daughter out,

1026
01:05:19,411 --> 01:05:20,112
that's not his name.

1027
01:05:20,146 --> 01:05:21,513
Those are not his photos

1028
01:05:21,546 --> 01:05:23,615
and he probably doesn't
even drive a Mustang.

1029
01:05:25,851 --> 01:05:27,786
And when were you planning
to tell us all this?

1030
01:05:27,819 --> 01:05:29,921
Mr. Riley, my job is
finding your daughter.

1031
01:05:29,956 --> 01:05:32,724
You don't need every single
piece of information, sir.

1032
01:05:32,757 --> 01:05:33,859
The hell I don't!

1033
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:35,694
I don't believe
anything you're saying.

1034
01:05:35,727 --> 01:05:38,697
We know everything about
you, dishonorably discharged.

1035
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:41,566
Three times in rehab
for alcoholism.

1036
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,767
Joanna.

1037
01:05:42,801 --> 01:05:44,436
No, he's trying
to take our money,

1038
01:05:44,469 --> 01:05:45,737
can't you see that?

1039
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:47,974
We should have just let
the cops handle this!

1040
01:05:55,647 --> 01:05:56,848
Stay on it, John.

1041
01:06:17,802 --> 01:06:20,106
These some high class
folks, little girls.

1042
01:06:21,673 --> 01:06:24,176
Good old white boys having
theyselves a bachelor party.

1043
01:06:26,678 --> 01:06:28,613
I want y'all to have
some fun tonight.

1044
01:06:30,149 --> 01:06:31,583
Me and the boys be right here

1045
01:06:31,616 --> 01:06:33,818
in case things get
out of control.

1046
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:37,489
Allison, you collecting
the money tonight.

1047
01:06:37,522 --> 01:06:39,524
It be five Gs.

1048
01:06:39,557 --> 01:06:40,993
Just keep this
under wraps, you know.

1049
01:06:41,027 --> 01:06:43,895
What happens in the basement
stays in the basement.

1050
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:46,631
Aight, y'all go
get that white boy money.

1051
01:06:46,665 --> 01:06:49,501
You know they daddies
gave them a lot of bread.

1052
01:06:49,534 --> 01:06:50,202
Come get all that.

1053
01:07:02,181 --> 01:07:03,715
Do good for Daddy.

1054
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,920
Y'all did good.

1055
01:08:17,922 --> 01:08:19,058
Y'all made Daddy proud.

1056
01:08:38,944 --> 01:08:40,712
20 grand a week, man.

1057
01:08:40,745 --> 01:08:42,148
That's a lot of bread.

1058
01:08:42,181 --> 01:08:43,349
Too much.

1059
01:08:43,382 --> 01:08:44,816
Hey Biggs,
you know that girl

1060
01:08:44,849 --> 01:08:45,683
you were looking for?

1061
01:08:45,717 --> 01:08:46,651
Yeah, what up, Blink?

1062
01:08:46,684 --> 01:08:48,187
I think I've
seen her man, for real.

1063
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:50,056
If she there, you
getting five Gs, homie.

1064
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:51,723
If she ain't, then you don't.

1065
01:08:51,756 --> 01:08:52,857
Let's talk
about the money.

1066
01:08:52,891 --> 01:08:54,026
I ain't
giving you nothing now.

1067
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:55,194
I'll tell
you what I know.

1068
01:08:55,227 --> 01:08:55,927
All right.

1069
01:08:57,029 --> 01:08:58,130
Now if you for sure for
sure, give me the address.

1070
01:08:58,164 --> 01:09:00,199
At the dog park,
I saw this van pulling up

1071
01:09:00,232 --> 01:09:01,200
with these girls getting out.

1072
01:09:01,233 --> 01:09:02,134
Dog?

1073
01:09:02,168 --> 01:09:03,802
No, I wanna
talk about the money.

1074
01:09:03,835 --> 01:09:05,837
You gonna mess around all day?
Like I said.

1075
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:07,672
If she there, you
gonna get paid.

1076
01:09:07,705 --> 01:09:09,041
I'm not gonna play you, homie.

1077
01:09:09,075 --> 01:09:11,010
All right,
all right, yeah.

1078
01:09:11,043 --> 01:09:12,677
All right, bet it up.

1079
01:09:13,645 --> 01:09:15,081
What you got, big man?

1080
01:09:15,114 --> 01:09:16,681
One of my regular snitches.

1081
01:09:16,714 --> 01:09:19,118
He said he seen the
girl, blonde girl.

1082
01:09:19,151 --> 01:09:21,719
White, suburban, stranger.

1083
01:09:21,753 --> 01:09:23,621
She's been wandering
out the house a lot.

1084
01:09:23,655 --> 01:09:24,789
That's our girl.

1085
01:09:24,823 --> 01:09:26,292
That's our girl.

1086
01:09:26,325 --> 01:09:27,892
We only about a mile away.

1087
01:09:27,926 --> 01:09:28,793
Let's roll.

1088
01:09:45,311 --> 01:09:47,179
Where have you been?

1089
01:09:48,913 --> 01:09:49,781
Shopping.

1090
01:09:50,983 --> 01:09:51,883
Still gotta eat.

1091
01:09:53,419 --> 01:09:54,619
It's been a month.

1092
01:10:02,694 --> 01:10:04,330
I know how long
it's been, Joanna.

1093
01:10:05,965 --> 01:10:07,099
Don't you think I know?

1094
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:09,767
I can tell you to the day

1095
01:10:11,137 --> 01:10:12,004
and the hour.

1096
01:10:14,974 --> 01:10:18,177
Please, don't
start fighting again.

1097
01:10:19,811 --> 01:10:21,380
Nobody's fighting.

1098
01:10:21,413 --> 01:10:22,982
We're not fighting.

1099
01:10:25,151 --> 01:10:26,018
Good.

1100
01:10:27,153 --> 01:10:30,855
Now, I'd like to
make a suggestion.

1101
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:35,227
I'd like the two of you
to take the night off

1102
01:10:35,261 --> 01:10:36,996
away from the house.

1103
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:40,099
Go see a silly comedy movie.

1104
01:10:40,132 --> 01:10:41,333
I'm not seeing a movie.

1105
01:10:42,734 --> 01:10:45,737
Then have a dinner,
go for a walk.

1106
01:10:45,770 --> 01:10:46,905
Joanna, you-

1107
01:10:49,741 --> 01:10:50,808
- What are you wearing?

1108
01:10:52,777 --> 01:10:53,412
Clothes?

1109
01:10:55,014 --> 01:10:56,315
No.

1110
01:10:56,348 --> 01:10:57,316
Go change.

1111
01:10:57,349 --> 01:10:58,450
Why do I have to change?

1112
01:10:59,817 --> 01:11:02,388
Because I said to,
and I'm your father.

1113
01:11:02,421 --> 01:11:03,821
Dad, there's nothing wrong-

1114
01:11:03,855 --> 01:11:05,324
- Go to your room and change!

1115
01:11:16,368 --> 01:11:19,038
It's not her fault, Case.

1116
01:11:19,071 --> 01:11:20,472
Mind your business, Barbara.

1117
01:11:22,374 --> 01:11:23,242
Well.

1118
01:11:24,376 --> 01:11:28,247
With another $20,000
check due tomorrow

1119
01:11:28,280 --> 01:11:30,815
I'd say that everything
that happens around here

1120
01:11:30,848 --> 01:11:32,051
is now my business.

1121
01:11:33,185 --> 01:11:34,386
Don't pay it.

1122
01:11:39,992 --> 01:11:42,094
What?

1123
01:11:44,463 --> 01:11:45,830
She's not coming back.

1124
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:49,401
Honey.

1125
01:11:54,373 --> 01:11:56,008
Belton is a crook.

1126
01:11:57,409 --> 01:11:59,078
He preys on people like us.

1127
01:12:01,913 --> 01:12:04,116
She's still missing
and he collects

1128
01:12:04,149 --> 01:12:06,018
$20,000 a week.

1129
01:12:10,256 --> 01:12:11,789
She's not coming back.

1130
01:12:19,598 --> 01:12:21,467
It's your friend Captain Belton.

1131
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:24,169
And I'm sure he gave
Kessler a nice referral fee.

1132
01:12:27,606 --> 01:12:29,141
John?

1133
01:12:29,174 --> 01:12:30,409
Case, hey.

1134
01:12:30,442 --> 01:12:32,877
Look, my man on the street just
got a very, very strong lead.

1135
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:34,446
Now normally I wouldn't call
you for every little detail

1136
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,348
but you told me you
wanted to know everything.

1137
01:12:36,382 --> 01:12:37,983
Wait, wait, are
you gonna check it out?

1138
01:12:38,017 --> 01:12:39,184
Now.

1139
01:12:39,218 --> 01:12:40,552
My guys are strapping
the gear on right now.

1140
01:12:40,586 --> 01:12:41,954
Keep me posted.

1141
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:44,056
I don't know, Case,
this could be it.

1142
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:46,191
Let's go!

1143
01:12:56,068 --> 01:12:56,735
I'm good!

1144
01:12:59,638 --> 01:13:03,442
All of a sudden,
I step on there!

1145
01:13:03,475 --> 01:13:04,343
Easy, bros!

1146
01:13:06,545 --> 01:13:08,447
Man, that ain't even funny.

1147
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,215
You almost got smoked.

1148
01:13:10,249 --> 01:13:11,183
Oh, man look at y'all.

1149
01:13:11,216 --> 01:13:12,217
All look scared.

1150
01:13:12,251 --> 01:13:14,386
Man, ain't nobody scared.

1151
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:16,121
You look scared.

1152
01:13:16,155 --> 01:13:17,623
I ain't scared.

1153
01:13:17,656 --> 01:13:19,024
You scared.

1154
01:13:19,058 --> 01:13:20,426
What the hell is
wrong with you, cuz?

1155
01:13:20,459 --> 01:13:22,328
I oughta shoot your
black ass just because.

1156
01:13:22,361 --> 01:13:24,096
Better check
your drawers first.

1157
01:13:25,164 --> 01:13:26,498
But you be happy I come.

1158
01:13:27,633 --> 01:13:30,868
Word on the street, is
y'all got a blonde girl.

1159
01:13:30,902 --> 01:13:32,271
Suburb girl.

1160
01:13:32,304 --> 01:13:34,906
And Biggs be looking
for her everywhere.

1161
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:38,377
10 large man, 10 large to
the man that bring her in.

1162
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:40,346
Next man through that door,

1163
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:43,015
he probably will
shoot your black ass.

1164
01:13:43,048 --> 01:13:43,915
But I know you.

1165
01:13:43,949 --> 01:13:45,117
You the type,

1166
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:47,119
you the type to take
care of a brother.

1167
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,988
I'm just here to get paid, man.

1168
01:13:52,658 --> 01:13:53,959
Let me check it out.

1169
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,262
What you say is true,
then I straighten you out.

1170
01:14:05,371 --> 01:14:06,238
Yeah.

1171
01:14:07,706 --> 01:14:08,574
Okay.

1172
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:12,945
Yeah, thanks, John.

1173
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:21,987
It wasn't her.

1174
01:14:24,056 --> 01:14:25,591
They raided the house,

1175
01:14:25,624 --> 01:14:29,461
there's a blonde
girl there, young.

1176
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:33,165
Looked out of place for Detroit.

1177
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:41,106
But she was there of
her own free will, 19.

1178
01:14:44,543 --> 01:14:46,078
Looked like Allison.

1179
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,515
But it wasn't her.

1180
01:14:53,018 --> 01:14:54,019
Fire him.

1181
01:14:55,053 --> 01:14:55,920
God, Joanna.

1182
01:14:57,589 --> 01:14:59,458
I can't handle
it anymore, Case,

1183
01:14:59,491 --> 01:15:00,925
I just can't take it.

1184
01:15:04,396 --> 01:15:05,264
Case.

1185
01:15:09,301 --> 01:15:10,402
Maybe it's time.

1186
01:15:11,637 --> 01:15:12,504
No, it isn't.

1187
01:15:13,472 --> 01:15:14,540
He's getting closer.

1188
01:15:15,707 --> 01:15:17,409
No, he's just
stringing us along.

1189
01:15:17,443 --> 01:15:18,610
I'm telling you, it's...

1190
01:15:20,145 --> 01:15:23,048
Oh my god, I just can't
handle it anymore.

1191
01:15:23,081 --> 01:15:23,949
Jo.

1192
01:15:25,083 --> 01:15:26,452
Now my daughter's alive.

1193
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:28,454
You know what, she's
alive, she's in Chicago,

1194
01:15:28,487 --> 01:15:32,291
she's with her
boyfriend and

1195
01:15:32,324 --> 01:15:33,192
she's happy.

1196
01:15:36,628 --> 01:15:37,963
It's a lie, Jo.

1197
01:15:39,631 --> 01:15:41,533
It's a lie I'm
willing to live with

1198
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:44,102
because I can't live
like this anymore.

1199
01:15:47,172 --> 01:15:48,040
Case.

1200
01:15:50,242 --> 01:15:51,376
She may be right.

1201
01:15:54,646 --> 01:15:57,115
I have to save some
money for myself.

1202
01:15:59,351 --> 01:16:00,752
And there's Rachel's college.

1203
01:16:05,123 --> 01:16:05,991
It's time.

1204
01:16:24,142 --> 01:16:25,210
Look homes, I ain't got nobody

1205
01:16:25,244 --> 01:16:26,678
chasing none of my chicas.

1206
01:16:26,712 --> 01:16:28,013
That problem's on you.

1207
01:16:29,515 --> 01:16:31,383
Man, I ain't even
gonna lie to you.

1208
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:33,752
I got some special interest
in one of my girls.

1209
01:16:33,785 --> 01:16:35,521
Friend of mine say you
be like some expert

1210
01:16:35,554 --> 01:16:37,256
professional interest in her.

1211
01:16:37,289 --> 01:16:39,157
He's on, man.

1212
01:16:39,191 --> 01:16:40,592
You owe me.

1213
01:16:40,626 --> 01:16:42,227

1214
01:16:42,261 --> 01:16:43,629
What you want?

1215
01:16:43,662 --> 01:16:45,264
I need four you girls.

1216
01:16:45,297 --> 01:16:47,165
You loco, esse,

I'll give you one.

1218
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,135
I'm talking a
prime white girl.

1219
01:16:50,168 --> 01:16:51,537
Educated, smart.

1220
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:54,573
I'm taking 1500 a night
every night, you feel me?

You got a white
chica with heat, homes.

1224
01:17:00,612 --> 01:17:01,613
That's what you have.

1225
01:17:01,847 --> 01:17:02,748
Man, heat's in Detroit.

1226
01:17:02,781 --> 01:17:03,916
If you take her to Houston,

1227
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:06,285
ain't nobody gonna be chasing
you there and you know it.

1228
01:17:06,318 --> 01:17:08,320

Come on, man.

01:17:17,729 --> 01:17:19,631
Two and you make the drive.

1234
01:17:19,665 --> 01:17:20,832
You drop them off here.

1235
01:17:20,866 --> 01:17:22,434
You pick up your
white girl up here

1236
01:17:22,467 --> 01:17:24,336

1237

No, put one of them
other hoes to work tonight.

01:17:57,369 --> 01:17:59,371
It happens, boss.

1243
01:17:59,404 --> 01:18:03,108
The intel was good,
just not the right girl.

1244
01:18:04,376 --> 01:18:05,377
We got fired today.

1245
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:08,213
Well, that happens too.

1246
01:18:09,214 --> 01:18:11,917
It's all part of the deal.

1247
01:18:11,951 --> 01:18:13,452
The girl is lost.

1248
01:18:14,620 --> 01:18:18,190
We move on, try to
save the next one.

1249
01:18:18,223 --> 01:18:19,658
It's all we can do.

1250
01:18:27,532 --> 01:18:29,635
I'm gonna go home and
get some sleep, Captain.

1251
01:18:29,668 --> 01:18:30,902
You should too.

1252

Hey, John.

You my friend?

1257
01:19:39,771 --> 01:19:42,240
'Cause I could use a friend.

1258
01:19:43,542 --> 01:19:44,609
Yeah, sure.

1259
01:19:45,877 --> 01:19:47,312
Hmm.

1260
01:19:47,345 --> 01:19:50,282
My $20,000 a week friend, huh?

1261
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:52,985
It's my job, Case.

1262
01:19:53,019 --> 01:19:54,753
It doesn't mean
I don't like you.

1263
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:58,223
Yeah, sure.

1264
01:19:59,491 --> 01:20:00,392
You okay?

1265
01:20:01,693 --> 01:20:03,695
Yeah, yeah.

1266
01:20:03,729 --> 01:20:06,898
I'm on top of the
world, old buddy!

1267
01:20:09,001 --> 01:20:10,502
How's the family?

1268
01:20:10,535 --> 01:20:11,403
The family?

1269
01:20:12,671 --> 01:20:13,538
Your wife?

1270
01:20:15,074 --> 01:20:17,375
Your mother-in-law,
Rachel, the family.

1271
01:20:17,409 --> 01:20:18,410
The family.

1272
01:20:19,578 --> 01:20:20,879
I don't know.

1273
01:20:22,314 --> 01:20:24,883
I'm in a hotel, John.

1274
01:20:24,916 --> 01:20:25,851
It's a nice room.

1275
01:20:27,452 --> 01:20:28,920
It has HBO.

1276
01:20:28,955 --> 01:20:30,722
I hear there's a
continental breakfast

1277
01:20:30,756 --> 01:20:32,891
so I'm looking forward to that.

1278
01:20:32,924 --> 01:20:35,794
Hey, come down here and
have a drink with me.

1279
01:20:37,362 --> 01:20:38,430
Can't do that, Case.

1280
01:20:40,499 --> 01:20:41,934
Three time loser, huh?

1281
01:20:43,368 --> 01:20:44,036
That's right.

1282
01:20:50,442 --> 01:20:51,676
You have a family, John?

1283
01:21:00,352 --> 01:21:03,455
Yeah, they're slipping
away from me, Case.

1284
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,356
Mmm.

1285
01:21:05,624 --> 01:21:07,425
Captain John Belton.

1286
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,998
Alcoholic with a dishonorable
discharge from the Marines.

1287
01:21:12,031 --> 01:21:14,833
You know, that wasn't
part of your sales pitch.

1288
01:21:17,702 --> 01:21:20,772
One of my boys was
behind enemy lines.

1289
01:21:21,974 --> 01:21:23,075
I was ordered to stand down

1290
01:21:23,109 --> 01:21:24,843
but I let my team in anyway.

1291
01:21:26,711 --> 01:21:30,549
And when I returned, I
assaulted my superior officer.

1292
01:21:34,153 --> 01:21:36,321
It was a long time ago.

1293
01:21:40,859 --> 01:21:42,794
Can you find her, John?

1294
01:21:46,999 --> 01:21:48,000
Can you find my girl?

1295
01:21:49,868 --> 01:21:51,369
You fired me, Case.

1296
01:21:53,672 --> 01:21:55,074
My mother-in-law fired you.

1297
01:21:55,107 --> 01:21:56,575
I'm hiring you.

1298
01:21:57,742 --> 01:22:00,712
Allison's college fund
is good for a few weeks.

1299
01:22:01,948 --> 01:22:02,814
You're drunk.

1300
01:22:03,815 --> 01:22:07,519
Look, do you want the
job or not, you coward?

1301
01:22:09,088 --> 01:22:10,789
Let me ask you something, John.

1302
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,493
Is there any hope left?

1303
01:22:20,933 --> 01:22:24,736
Yeah, there's
definitely hope left.

1304
01:22:24,769 --> 01:22:27,173
And every second counts, Case.

1305
01:22:27,206 --> 01:22:29,008
I'm gonna get back
on it right now.

1306
01:22:35,214 --> 01:22:36,082
Okay.

1307
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:39,618
Okay.

1308
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:51,130
I bet you'll come down
for that drink now,

1309
01:22:51,163 --> 01:22:55,134
won't you, my $20,000
a week friend?

1310
01:22:55,167 --> 01:22:56,701
Do you wanna insult me

1311
01:22:56,735 --> 01:22:58,803
or do you wanna help
me find your daughter?

1312
01:23:01,173 --> 01:23:01,840
I'm sorry.

1313
01:23:03,475 --> 01:23:04,944
I mean it, John,
I didn't mean...

1314
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:09,181
You and me partners?

1315
01:23:10,649 --> 01:23:11,783
Butch and Sundance?

1316
01:23:13,019 --> 01:23:13,885
Yeah.

1317
01:23:15,054 --> 01:23:15,921
You and me.

1318
01:23:17,689 --> 01:23:19,858
Why don't you get some
sleep now, partner

1319
01:23:19,891 --> 01:23:21,459
and I'll call you
in the morning?

1320
01:23:23,662 --> 01:23:24,663
All right.

1321
01:23:25,764 --> 01:23:27,832
All right, I'm gonna
get some sleep.

1322
01:23:53,025 --> 01:23:54,926
I don't want you to
be mad at your mom.

1323
01:23:57,096 --> 01:23:57,964
Okay.

1324
01:24:00,099 --> 01:24:01,000
Life is hard.

1325
01:24:05,037 --> 01:24:06,571
I guess it doesn't
get any easier

1326
01:24:06,604 --> 01:24:07,906
but you're gonna be okay.

1327
01:24:09,674 --> 01:24:10,875
Dad?

1328
01:24:10,909 --> 01:24:12,144
Yeah?

1329
01:24:12,178 --> 01:24:14,246
I don't want you to go.

1330
01:24:15,314 --> 01:24:16,182
I know.

1331
01:24:18,017 --> 01:24:18,883
I know.

1332
01:24:39,305 --> 01:24:41,007
Come on, Vanessa.

1333
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,174
You be working tonight.

1334
01:25:01,961 --> 01:25:04,063
Take a real good look at this.

1335
01:25:05,931 --> 01:25:07,033
I bet you ain't know Detroit

1336
01:25:07,066 --> 01:25:08,934
has some nice
neighborhoods, did you?

1337
01:25:10,336 --> 01:25:13,172
High class negroes, Jews,

1338
01:25:13,205 --> 01:25:16,641
Caldeans with they gas
station money, big houses

1339
01:25:16,674 --> 01:25:19,011
built back when the auto
industry was booming.

1340
01:25:20,346 --> 01:25:22,948
Henry Ford heself lived
out two blocks from here.

1341
01:25:24,783 --> 01:25:28,187
I bet you you didn't even know
I knew my history, did you?

1342
01:25:28,220 --> 01:25:30,222
Yeah, I know a lot more.

1343
01:25:31,323 --> 01:25:33,825
I'ma get us a big house
like this one day.

1344
01:25:34,893 --> 01:25:36,295
Just gotta get my money right.

1345
01:25:40,099 --> 01:25:41,833
He paid for three hours

1346
01:25:41,866 --> 01:25:42,734
but I'll be right here.

1347
01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:45,004
Go on now.

1348
01:26:02,254 --> 01:26:03,089
Hi.

1349
01:26:03,122 --> 01:26:03,956
Hi, sir.

1350
01:26:03,989 --> 01:26:04,856
Wow.

1351
01:26:05,723 --> 01:26:06,858
You're really handsome.

1352
01:26:40,459 --> 01:26:41,393
What's going on?

1353
01:26:42,394 --> 01:26:44,396
Relax, child.

1354
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:46,398
My name is Pastor Brown.

1355
01:26:46,432 --> 01:26:48,900
You're with good people now.

1356
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:53,272
No, no, no, no.

1357
01:26:53,305 --> 01:26:55,441
Daddy's gonna kill me.

1358
01:26:55,474 --> 01:26:57,042
- Hold her!
- No, no, no.

1359
01:26:57,076 --> 01:26:59,378
- Hold her now.
- No, no, no.

1360
01:26:59,411 --> 01:27:01,280
Daddy!

1361
01:27:01,313 --> 01:27:02,181
Let me go!

1362
01:27:03,349 --> 01:27:04,350
You're all right.

1363
01:27:04,383 --> 01:27:05,650
You'll be okay.

1364
01:27:06,452 --> 01:27:07,785
It's all good.

1365
01:27:09,155 --> 01:27:10,822
It's okay.

1366
01:27:10,855 --> 01:27:13,758
Come on, go with me, okay?

1367
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:15,027
Come on.

1368
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,694
We got you.

1369
01:27:16,728 --> 01:27:17,662
We got you, baby.

1370
01:27:32,244 --> 01:27:33,946
Just got off the
phone with Detroit PD.

1371
01:27:33,979 --> 01:27:35,114
They're backed up.

1372
01:27:35,147 --> 01:27:36,949
Don't have time to
come arrest the pimp.

1373
01:27:36,982 --> 01:27:39,218
He's gonna get
away with it again.

1374
01:27:39,251 --> 01:27:40,752
No he's not.

1375
01:27:40,785 --> 01:27:42,154
What do we do?

1376
01:27:42,188 --> 01:27:43,355
I'ma go out there

1377
01:27:44,756 --> 01:27:47,159
and I'm gonna get
his face on video.

1378
01:27:48,294 --> 01:27:50,396
Good way to get
yourself shot, sir.

1379
01:27:50,429 --> 01:27:52,097
I lived a long life, son.

1380
01:27:53,831 --> 01:27:56,101
If the Lord's will
for me to die tonight,

1381
01:27:57,403 --> 01:27:58,803
then I'll trust his will.

1382
01:28:00,172 --> 01:28:03,908
If I go down, pick up my phone.

1383
01:28:05,377 --> 01:28:08,247
Show his face to the world.

1384
01:28:09,215 --> 01:28:11,350
Let me get my gun and go
out there with you, sir.

1385
01:28:11,383 --> 01:28:12,218
No, no.

1386
01:28:12,251 --> 01:28:13,851
No violence tonight, son.

1387
01:28:14,886 --> 01:28:16,121
You got this.

1388
01:28:17,855 --> 01:28:18,856
May God bless you, sir.

1389
01:28:22,927 --> 01:28:24,896
- God bless you.
- God bless you.

1390
01:28:35,074 --> 01:28:37,842
What's your name?

1391
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:40,346
I see your face!

1392
01:28:40,379 --> 01:28:41,779
I see your car!

1393
01:28:42,481 --> 01:28:45,817
You get out of my neighborhood!

1394
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:48,254
You stay out of my neighborhood!

1395
01:28:48,287 --> 01:28:51,523
If I ever see you in
my neighborhood again,

1396
01:28:51,557 --> 01:28:53,292
I'ma forget I'm a pastor!

1397
01:29:06,272 --> 01:29:07,139
John.

1398
01:29:08,274 --> 01:29:09,541
Just got a call from
one of my contacts

1399
01:29:09,575 --> 01:29:10,509
at the hospital.

1400
01:29:10,542 --> 01:29:12,278
A church group rescued a girl.

1401
01:29:12,311 --> 01:29:13,445
Looks like she's been
through the ringer.

1402
01:29:13,479 --> 01:29:14,413
You know the type?

1403
01:29:15,314 --> 01:29:16,881
Go on.

1404
01:29:16,914 --> 01:29:19,418
The girl says that she's
been imprisoned for a while.

1405
01:29:19,451 --> 01:29:21,487
The nurse said that she
mentioned a blonde girl.

1406
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,821
Description matches Allison's.

1407
01:29:23,855 --> 01:29:25,424
Tex, go with her.

1408
01:29:37,136 --> 01:29:39,471
Hi, we're trying
to find Vanessa Garcia.

1409
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,442
Down the hall to
the right, third bed.

1410
01:29:43,475 --> 01:29:45,110
Wait, wait!

1411
01:29:45,144 --> 01:29:46,345
What do you want with my niece?

1412
01:29:46,378 --> 01:29:47,980
Private investigator, Ma'am.

1413
01:29:48,013 --> 01:29:49,381
We're trying to find
somebody we believe

1414
01:29:49,415 --> 01:29:51,984
may have been kidnapped
alongside your daughter.

1415
01:29:52,017 --> 01:29:53,851
She's been through enough!

1416
01:29:53,885 --> 01:29:55,820
She's answered the
police's questions!

1417
01:29:57,289 --> 01:29:58,923
Tell them, Pastor.

1418
01:29:58,957 --> 01:30:00,326
Tell them to leave
my girl alone!

1419
01:30:00,359 --> 01:30:02,528
Ma'am, we're just trying
to help find somebody.

1420
01:30:05,197 --> 01:30:06,065
Esperanza.

1421
01:30:07,366 --> 01:30:09,968
This man is trying
to save other girls

1422
01:30:10,002 --> 01:30:11,136
just like her.

1423
01:30:12,338 --> 01:30:14,973
The Lord wants us
to help him do that.

1424
01:30:21,046 --> 01:30:22,548
If you think
it's best, Pastor.

1425
01:30:23,549 --> 01:30:24,416
I do.

1426
01:30:26,385 --> 01:30:27,386
Thank you, Pastor.

1427
01:30:35,661 --> 01:30:36,595
Hi.

1428
01:30:36,628 --> 01:30:38,430
You here for Vanessa Garcia?

1429
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,331
One second.

1430
01:30:40,966 --> 01:30:41,600
Thank you.

1431
01:30:43,369 --> 01:30:46,372
Okay, I gave her something
for the withdrawal.

1432
01:30:46,405 --> 01:30:48,340
She's hooked on oxycontin.

1433
01:30:48,374 --> 01:30:50,875
She's gonna crash
hard, real hard.

1434
01:30:52,077 --> 01:30:54,947
As tough as it is,
talking to her now

1435
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:57,383
is probably the
best thing, okay?

1436
01:30:57,416 --> 01:30:58,283
There she is.

1437
01:30:59,151 --> 01:31:00,052
Thank you.

1438
01:31:08,293 --> 01:31:09,161
It's okay.

1439
01:31:10,362 --> 01:31:12,331
My name is Karen
and I'm a friend.

1440
01:31:15,534 --> 01:31:17,503
Honey, what's your name?

1441
01:31:26,712 --> 01:31:27,579
My name?

1442
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:31,483
Yeah.

1443
01:31:31,517 --> 01:31:33,118
You remember your name, right?

1444
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:35,387
Vanessa.

1445
01:31:43,729 --> 01:31:45,531
Vanessa, where
did you come from?

1446
01:31:49,368 --> 01:31:52,337
He used to call me
his little songbird.

1447
01:31:56,575 --> 01:31:57,409
I'm a singer.

1448
01:32:01,613 --> 01:32:03,715
Daddy's house.

1449
01:32:03,749 --> 01:32:06,518
Do you know
where the house is?

1450
01:32:09,588 --> 01:32:11,390
I don't know.

1451
01:32:11,423 --> 01:32:13,125
I don't know.

1452
01:32:13,158 --> 01:32:14,626
What's the house near, honey?

1453
01:32:15,761 --> 01:32:17,196
I don't know.

1454
01:32:18,163 --> 01:32:19,698
I don't know.

1455
01:32:19,731 --> 01:32:22,367
Can you remember anything
that's near the house?

1456
01:32:28,774 --> 01:32:29,641
Dogs.

1457
01:32:32,277 --> 01:32:33,979
There's a park and,

1458
01:32:36,782 --> 01:32:38,650
there was a store in the corner.

1459
01:32:41,487 --> 01:32:42,354
Good.

1460
01:32:47,626 --> 01:32:50,562
Vanessa, have you
seen this girl before?

1461
01:32:53,398 --> 01:32:54,266
Yeah.

1462
01:32:56,502 --> 01:33:00,506
She's my friend.

1463
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:02,608
Okay, and you're
sure you know her?

1464
01:33:05,377 --> 01:33:06,245
Allison.

1465
01:33:13,385 --> 01:33:14,253
Vanessa?

1466
01:33:15,387 --> 01:33:17,489
Vanessa, I want
you to look at me.

1467
01:33:19,625 --> 01:33:21,627
We will find Allison.

1468
01:33:22,694 --> 01:33:23,562
Do you hear me?

1469
01:33:24,563 --> 01:33:25,564
We will find her.

1470
01:33:27,432 --> 01:33:30,502
And you, you're safe now.

1471
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:34,106
You're safe.

1472
01:34:11,343 --> 01:34:12,210
Yeah.

1473
01:34:13,145 --> 01:34:13,812
Yeah.

1474
01:34:17,316 --> 01:34:19,251
She gave a positive
ID on your daughter,

1475
01:34:19,284 --> 01:34:20,619
knew her by name.

1476
01:34:23,589 --> 01:34:24,523
She's ali...

1477
01:34:26,491 --> 01:34:28,527
Allison's alive?

1478
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:29,428
Yes.

1479
01:34:31,163 --> 01:34:32,497
And in Detroit?

1480
01:34:32,531 --> 01:34:34,499
Well we assume so
for the time being.

1481
01:34:37,903 --> 01:34:40,138
What do you mean
for the time being?

1482
01:34:40,172 --> 01:34:41,673
Look, Case, these
people that I deal with,

1483
01:34:41,707 --> 01:34:43,408
they're smart, okay?

1484
01:34:43,442 --> 01:34:44,576
As soon as they feel
the noose tightening

1485
01:34:44,610 --> 01:34:48,480
they get up and they move their
operation to another city.

1486
01:34:48,513 --> 01:34:50,148
Our leads are strong.

1487
01:34:50,182 --> 01:34:52,517
Okay, we got some
really good breaks.

1488
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:55,554
Thank you, John.

1489
01:34:57,856 --> 01:35:00,125
How are things at home, Case?

1490
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:03,161
I haven't been home in a week.

1491
01:35:04,396 --> 01:35:06,531
Well you tell Joanna
we're getting close.

1492
01:35:10,636 --> 01:35:12,904
John, be honest with me.

1493
01:35:17,342 --> 01:35:19,277
Are we gonna find my daughter?

1494
01:35:24,549 --> 01:35:29,454
If I tell her and we
don't find Allison,

1495
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:33,392
Joanna will never forgive me.

1496
01:35:34,926 --> 01:35:36,294
What would you do, John?

1497
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:39,197
Pray.

1498
01:35:40,365 --> 01:35:45,370
I may
be all prayed out.

1499
01:35:46,438 --> 01:35:47,739
You always have one left.

1500
01:35:51,543 --> 01:35:52,411
Yeah.

1501
01:36:05,992 --> 01:36:09,461
Look man, give me the Caddy
straight up for the Benz.

1502
01:36:09,494 --> 01:36:10,729
Stolen?

1503
01:36:10,762 --> 01:36:12,698
No man, it ain't stolen.

1504
01:36:12,731 --> 01:36:15,734
I got papers for
you and everything.

1505
01:36:15,767 --> 01:36:17,502
Why do
you wanna get rid of it?

1506
01:36:17,536 --> 01:36:18,704
You talk too much.

1507
01:36:18,737 --> 01:36:20,639
We talking business or
we talking personal?

1508
01:36:20,672 --> 01:36:22,274
Hey, you're on my lot.

1509
01:36:22,307 --> 01:36:24,643
And I'm about to
not be on your lot.

1510
01:36:24,676 --> 01:36:26,344
You want my money or don't you?

1511
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:30,782
Straight up for the Cadillac?

1512
01:36:30,816 --> 01:36:32,018
Straight up, let's go.

1513
01:36:32,051 --> 01:36:32,918
Let's do it.

1514
01:36:45,330 --> 01:36:47,699
36 hours since
Vanessa was rescued.

1515
01:36:47,733 --> 01:36:50,268
The clock is still
ticking, people.

1516
01:36:50,302 --> 01:36:51,236
Biggs?

1517
01:36:51,269 --> 01:36:53,039
Well, I mean there's
a few of those Benzes

1518
01:36:53,072 --> 01:36:53,940
floating around the city.

1519
01:36:53,973 --> 01:36:55,607
Detroit's a big place.

1520
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:56,742
This might be the right Benz

1521
01:36:56,775 --> 01:36:59,544
or it could be some other
cat's Benz, I don't know.

1522
01:36:59,578 --> 01:37:00,712
All right, but
your contact says

1523
01:37:00,746 --> 01:37:02,314
they are running girls
out of that house.

1524
01:37:02,347 --> 01:37:04,483
That's what the brother
say, but he a crackhead.

1525
01:37:04,516 --> 01:37:05,851
They'll say anything
to get paid.

1526
01:37:05,884 --> 01:37:06,785
The neighborhood?

1527
01:37:06,818 --> 01:37:07,753
Well there's a dog park

1528
01:37:07,786 --> 01:37:09,654
and there's a corner store too.

1529
01:37:09,688 --> 01:37:11,490
Huh, but they call it
that because there's one

1530
01:37:11,523 --> 01:37:12,390
on every corner.

1531
01:37:12,424 --> 01:37:13,792
Aaron.

1532
01:37:13,825 --> 01:37:15,327
Park me up front of the house,

1533
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,362
I'll pick up the
wifi if they have it.

1534
01:37:17,395 --> 01:37:19,664
Probably pick up a
few other houses too.

1535
01:37:19,698 --> 01:37:21,500
I won't know which signal
is coming from our house

1536
01:37:21,533 --> 01:37:22,901
so I'll have to
break the passcodes

1537
01:37:22,935 --> 01:37:24,302
and that can take time.

1538
01:37:24,336 --> 01:37:25,303
How much time?

1539
01:37:25,337 --> 01:37:27,405
I don't know, time.

1540
01:37:27,439 --> 01:37:28,640
Then it's gonna
take me even longer

1541
01:37:28,673 --> 01:37:29,841
to go through everything.

1542
01:37:29,875 --> 01:37:31,810
I may have to break
emails, social media,

1543
01:37:31,843 --> 01:37:33,411
if they've recently
cleared their history.

1544
01:37:33,445 --> 01:37:35,781
All right, all right, all
right, I got it, I got it.

1545
01:37:35,814 --> 01:37:37,582
Tex, take the van, park
it out there tonight.

1546
01:37:37,616 --> 01:37:39,417
See what computer boy can get.

1547
01:38:00,472 --> 01:38:02,340
I'm in their system, John.

1548
01:38:02,374 --> 01:38:03,542
There's definitely some girls.

1549
01:38:03,575 --> 01:38:05,410
There's just no
pictures of Allison.

1550
01:38:05,443 --> 01:38:07,612
You tell me that there's
a tan Benz in that driveway,

1551
01:38:07,646 --> 01:38:09,414
it's time to kick
down some doors.

1552
01:38:16,822 --> 01:38:18,057
No, sir.

1553
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:19,258
Cadillac, red.

1554
01:38:27,934 --> 01:38:28,968
What do you wanna do, Captain?

1555
01:38:31,803 --> 01:38:32,671
Stand down.

1556
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:40,112
What did he say,
are we going in?

1557
01:38:41,479 --> 01:38:42,781
We've been
ordered to stand down.

1558
01:38:42,814 --> 01:38:43,682
Dammit!

1559
01:38:46,685 --> 01:38:48,120
I got it.

1560
01:38:48,154 --> 01:38:50,522
Call everybody, get
them in the office, now!

1561
01:38:52,557 --> 01:38:53,525
Hoo rah, son.

1562
01:38:55,527 --> 01:38:56,728
How sure are you?

1563
01:38:56,761 --> 01:38:57,997
100 percent.

1564
01:38:58,030 --> 01:38:59,999
Ain't nothing a
hundred percent.

1565
01:39:00,032 --> 01:39:02,367
Find, then I'm 99.

1566
01:39:03,702 --> 01:39:06,038
Somebody in that neighborhood
is pimping out girls.

1567
01:39:06,072 --> 01:39:08,140
I see them posting
ads for it constantly.

1568
01:39:09,474 --> 01:39:10,109
Biggs.

1569
01:39:10,142 --> 01:39:11,143
I got one more guy.

1570
01:39:11,177 --> 01:39:12,744
Said the house with the Caddy

1571
01:39:12,777 --> 01:39:15,547
used to have a Benz over there.

1572
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:16,915
So now along with the crackhead,

1573
01:39:16,949 --> 01:39:18,150
that now makes two.

1574
01:39:19,185 --> 01:39:21,087
But my one new guy,

1575
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:23,990
he said he believes
that the Benz was white.

1576
01:39:24,023 --> 01:39:25,490
How do you feel about it?

1577
01:39:27,126 --> 01:39:28,027
I'm not sure, boss.

1578
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:29,028
Maybe 50 percent.

1579
01:39:32,797 --> 01:39:35,600
Case, it's your daughter.

1580
01:39:35,634 --> 01:39:37,502
You gotta make the call.

1581
01:39:37,535 --> 01:39:39,671
If we go into the wrong house,

1582
01:39:39,704 --> 01:39:41,173
they are gonna move her.

1583
01:39:41,207 --> 01:39:44,110
To some other city,
Chicago, New York, Atlanta.

1584
01:39:45,543 --> 01:39:47,579
I have no idea, we may
never find her again.

1585
01:39:47,612 --> 01:39:51,650
If we wait, we may
get a stronger lead.

1586
01:39:51,816 --> 01:39:53,718
The truth is, they know
the noose is tightening.

1587
01:39:53,752 --> 01:39:54,819
They know we're looking for her.

1588
01:39:54,853 --> 01:39:57,522
They may move her in the
next couple of days anyway.

1589
01:40:00,026 --> 01:40:00,892
It's your call.

1590
01:40:10,735 --> 01:40:11,603
Kick it down.

1591
01:40:14,941 --> 01:40:16,875
All right, you heard
the man, let's go.

1592
01:40:16,908 --> 01:40:18,010
I'm going with you.

1593
01:40:18,044 --> 01:40:19,778
No, you're staying here
and letting us do our job.

1594
01:40:19,811 --> 01:40:20,712
I'm getting in that car.

1595
01:40:20,745 --> 01:40:22,580
You wanna stop me, shoot me.

1596
01:41:24,176 --> 01:41:25,677
Got one coming to you, Tex!

1597
01:41:25,710 --> 01:41:28,147
Get his ass out of here!

1598
01:41:46,032 --> 01:41:47,699
Good work, son.

1599
01:41:47,732 --> 01:41:48,566
Hoo rah.

1600
01:42:46,891 --> 01:42:47,759
Allison.

1601
01:42:52,797 --> 01:42:53,631
Excuse me.

1602
01:44:18,217 --> 01:44:19,051
Alex?

1603
01:44:19,084 --> 01:44:20,319
- Hey.
- Hi.

1604
01:44:20,352 --> 01:44:22,488
Where are we going?

1605
01:44:22,521 --> 01:44:23,821
You'll see.
