1
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:46,208
There are three stages to gambling.

2
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:48,500
The first thing that's important...

3
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,917
is to not be afraid of losing.

4
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:54,667
<i>And second the last handout
is the most important.</i>

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,625
Worry that you might lose.

6
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,583
Mr. Guo, you want to bet with me?

7
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,667
What kind of bet?

8
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,208
Guess how many sunflower seeds are left.

9
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,125
Whoever is the closest wins.

10
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:09,375
What's the reward?

11
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:12,583
If you win,
I will give you a whole lot of seeds.

12
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:14,500
If I win,

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,417
then you'll have to sign
this mental consent form.

14
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,125
OK.

15
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:25,375
Seventy...

16
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:28,625
or more if I add my age to my sibling.

17
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:31,458
Sixty-eight.

18
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,667
Three, four, five, six...

19
00:01:37,083 --> 00:01:39,792
Four, five, six, seven, eight.

20
00:01:41,917 --> 00:01:43,167
How did you get it right?

21
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:44,458
You must be curious,

22
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,624
but you'll have to wait
until your treatment's done.

23
00:01:47,917 --> 00:01:49,167
Till then...

24
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:50,833
Sign this.

25
00:01:59,167 --> 00:02:04,208
(Guo ZhiDa)

26
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,833
Write the lower case letters first,

27
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,458
then you should follow
with the upper case letter.

28
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:12,167
My teacher researched Chinese characters.

29
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,750
The mistakes and imperfections
within the characters.

30
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:16,417
It's always plaint on handwriting.

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,917
The first game of Asia World Cup
has just started.

32
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,542
Do you bet on the games?

33
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,708
I don't watch, just bet.

34
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,792
You know that
you're gonna inherit the company.

35
00:02:35,958 --> 00:02:37,833
Your brother willingly offered his factory

36
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:40,208
as a condition for the loan
I am graciously giving him.

37
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:43,167
Now the factory has burnt down,
so I can't get anything from you.

38
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:44,458
I'll give you two weeks,

39
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:46,667
you'll pay for your brother's debt to me,
understand?

40
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:48,917
Shit!

41
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,500
Hurry up and pay me my money!

42
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:59,083
If not, I'll give you
what your brother deserves.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's go.

44
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,750
<i>Team Ju Yuan, the home team
is facing Goyang Shingsung...</i>

45
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,125
<i>Police are investigating...</i>

46
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,125
Dr. Yang is a good person.

47
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,750
Almost like my brother.

48
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:16,167
<i>I should thank you.</i>

49
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,958
<i>South America,
like Argentina and Brazil...</i>

50
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:20,542
You should bet on the team that wins.

51
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,184
- Where do you want to go?
- Take me to the Hilton Hotel.

52
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,583
You can speak Chinese?

53
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,083
<i>I quit gambling.
But I can teach you how to.</i>

54
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:27,167
(Lu Lu)

55
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,333
<i>Li Zhiyu, you have to score today</i>

56
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,208
<i>or I am going to die.</i>

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,542
I told my younger brother
to bet on Ju Yuan.

58
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:36,458
Lulu.

59
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:37,809
- What are you saying?
- And I can earn...

60
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,833
<i>I am going to die.</i>

61
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,458
A lot of money from gambling.

62
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,208
You're gonna have to score for me today,

63
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,458
or I am going to be killed.

64
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,583
Don't fail me.

65
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,875
<i>I have a game-changing plan.</i>

66
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,500
<i>Always works.</i>

67
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:58,875
Call it without worrying...

68
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,792
because there's no risk.

69
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,542
<i>Li Zhiyu probably got my message.</i>

70
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:11,042
(TIK TOK)

71
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,917
Today is really such an unlucky day.

72
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:40,208
Will you just answer it?

73
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,375
CAPTAIN JIANG'S WIFE

74
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:48,042
How are you? Yes, but he cannot pick up.
Captain Jiang is busy.

75
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,375
Yes.

76
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,304
He really can't
pick up the phone right now.

77
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,542
It's near the university.

78
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,750
Yes, I see.

79
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:57,000
- Go straight.
- Hello.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hello?

81
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:10,167
So, she just told me that the divorce
agreement deadline is tomorrow.

82
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:13,250
- She said there's no use in avoiding this.
- Turn right.

83
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:22,167
<i>If I hadn't messed up,
the factory would still be there.</i>

84
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:25,125
<i>My younger sibling is still in America.</i>

85
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:27,250
<i>If it wasn't for me,
he'd have no threats.</i>

86
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:28,667
<i>But then...</i>

87
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,583
<i>I sit here with nothing.</i>

88
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,083
<i>I can only pay with my life.</i>

89
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,917
<i>The trash needs to die off.</i>

90
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,417
<i>The elite need to survive.</i>

91
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,208
<i>It's how the world has always been.</i>

92
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,417
<i>Dr. Yang.</i>

93
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,833
<i>Is it possible to drown yourself
in a bathtub, after this?</i>

94
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,292
You only saw a small part.

95
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:57,708
This is a typical form of post-traumatic
stress and bipolar disorder.

96
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:02,292
If it's antisocial personality disorder,
we will have to hospitalize him.

97
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,917
But how do you diagnose him so fast?

98
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,422
My brother absolutely
needs the treatment again.

99
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,708
I already told you that I am still trying.

100
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:14,500
And what I am looking for
is a better hospital for you both,

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,958
one where he will be able to remain safe.

102
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:22,958
Did your brother tell you
about the Youzhuan plan?

103
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,333
I have no idea about his plan.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I plan on taking him to the US.

105
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,208
He needs to have an operation
where he's at home.

106
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,500
How can he be home in a mental hospital?

107
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:40,333
Youzhuan is game changing.

108
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:42,583
I don't know why he changed it.

109
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,167
ROOM 811

110
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,750
Excuse me, Dr. Yang.

111
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:44,708
Your delivery has arrived.

112
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,458
Don't move!

113
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,958
- Lay down.
- Don't move.

114
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,625
<i>Team A, move out, now.</i>

115
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:06,917
On our way.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,375
<i>Move to the first floor now.</i>

117
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:10,500
<i>Everyone get ready
to take him down. Now!</i>

118
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,875
<i>I repeat! I repeat!</i>

119
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,375
<i>Right now this criminal
is about to escape.</i>

120
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:17,083
<i>Everyone, get ready to take him down.</i>

121
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,792
<i>Ladies and gentleman,
here at Korea Goyang Stadium.</i>

122
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:08,083
<i>This the second game
of the 2016 Asia World Cup.</i>

123
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:13,000
<i>Home team, Korea Shinsung
vs. China's Guangzhou Ju Yuan.</i>

124
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,167
<i>Right now it's 1600, we're getting close.</i>

125
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,833
<i>Thirty minutes till game time.</i>

126
00:09:16,917 --> 00:09:18,167
<i>Right now the crowd...</i>

127
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:23,208
Help me! Help me!

128
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:30,667
We need to move.

129
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,393
Captain Jiang said that
there isn't much time.

130
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:33,500
So, let's move.

131
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:39,976
He's helping out with the case,

132
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,375
but nothing really seemed
to stand about it, sir.

133
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:43,667
Who is this?

134
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,167
The explosion happened during betting
on an illegal soccer match.

135
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:50,042
That's when he was burnt,
and he got PTSD.

136
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:52,042
PTSD?

137
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,125
PTSD is known as
Post-traumatic stress disorder.

138
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,958
So, they thought that he was a good case
for Dr. Yang's experience.

139
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:04,958
The Chinese people that live in Korea
have been examined

140
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,208
by Dr. Yang's research.

141
00:10:06,292 --> 00:10:08,125
All of the families agreed
to work with her.

142
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,625
Does he have a family?

143
00:10:10,292 --> 00:10:12,500
Yes. He has a brother named Guo Zhihua.

144
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,750
He has been living in America.

145
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:18,208
And recently he came from America
to take care of his brother.

146
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,125
Hello!

147
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,250
That's right.

148
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,518
- Give it to me. Give it here.
- I'm busy at the moment. Can you hold on?

149
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,022
I'll take the phone. Give it to here.

150
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,458
That is my property.

151
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,542
This is an important evidence.

152
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,750
Our officers can hold onto this.

153
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,292
I'll call the Chinese Embassy.

154
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:49,625
You cannot arrest me.

155
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,000
I hate to tell you, we have that right.

156
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,250
The Embassy will notify you later.

157
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,125
For now...

158
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:03,042
you can't contact anyone
without getting permission from me.

159
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,500
Yang Xi,

160
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:09,208
you were born in Julgangsung Hangzhou,
China in 1986, China...

161
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,000
China... Hand it over.

162
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:17,250
Then at Renmin University of China,

163
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,292
with a doctorate degree in psychology.

164
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,917
And then you were at Seoul University
about two months ago.

165
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But, Officer...

166
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:24,583
Is this doctor working illegally?

167
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,042
You were treating him and you know it.

168
00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:58,083
What did he do to receive
such harassment from you?

169
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,847
You will listen! I'm asking the questions.

170
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,625
Where are Zhida's medical records
and your notes?

171
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,250
You know, I can't divulge that.

172
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,750
Here, Captain.

173
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,958
I can only tell you
and you need to remember this.

174
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:26,375
Whatever you do,
you cannot take that mask off him.

175
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:29,958
All right.

176
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:35,375
<i>Your name, age, and address.</i>

177
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,000
<i>Where is the hostage?</i>

178
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,083
<i>Here is the pen.</i>

179
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,708
<i>Did you hear...</i>

180
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,792
<i>Are you OK?</i>

181
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,583
Calm down.

182
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:57,667
Hold on.

183
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:58,708
Calm down.

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,125
Hey!

185
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,667
Calm down! Stay!

186
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:12,917
You hold him!

187
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,250
- Tell him to stop. Go on.
- Yeah. OK.

188
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,458
The music,
it should help to calm him down,

189
00:14:09,042 --> 00:14:10,625
if you keep all this up.

190
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,542
You can do it again after five minutes.

191
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,792
OK, Captain.

192
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,500
Apologies, I've used the towel.

193
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,083
You should apologize.

194
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And also for this?

195
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,875
OK, An, remove them.

196
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,583
OK.

197
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:33,042
I will be interrogating her,
so don't let anyone through the door.

198
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,250
OK.

199
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,292
I'll leave this to cover
the cost of the towel.

200
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,708
My wife's Chinese too
and she's particular about towels.

201
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,792
My name is Jiang Chengjun.

202
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:46,417
Since you're short on time,
why don't you tell me briefly?

203
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:48,708
If I am going to help you,

204
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:51,083
you must explain everything
that's happened.

205
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,091
<i>You're gonna have to score
for me today, babe,</i>

206
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,583
<i>or I'm going to be killed.</i>

207
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:00,708
Lei Lu.

208
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:03,500
<i>She is the wife of team Ju Yuan's
Li Zhiyu.</i>

209
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,000
<i>This morning
after all the wives went shopping,</i>

210
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:09,500
it seems she got a text,
and so she went into the hotel

211
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,792
and she was all by herself.

212
00:15:12,042 --> 00:15:14,000
After that no one saw her.

213
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,500
<i>This morning Li Zhiyu
got a threatening call.</i>

214
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,583
Lulu.

215
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,833
Is that a bomb that's tied on her?

216
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,667
I am pretty sure that it's a time bomb.

217
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:25,000
If you do the math,
the bomb will explode at 6:15,

218
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,458
which is also the time
that the match ends.

219
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,625
Are you thinking Guo Zhida did it?

220
00:15:30,042 --> 00:15:34,167
After we got the call, we traced the call,
and that's how we ended up here with you.

221
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,292
He dropped the phone when he got arrested.

222
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:40,583
I checked the phone
and it belongs to Lei Lu.

223
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:42,583
So, are you saying

224
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:45,708
that I need to talk to Guo Zhida
to know where she is now?

225
00:15:45,792 --> 00:15:46,792
Is that it?

226
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,792
Guo Zhida's been talking to you
and it seems you've gotten close

227
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,167
ever since he came in here.

228
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:55,667
OK, then I'll help you.

229
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:00,333
And I think that both need rescuing.

230
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:10,875
Why did you come back here?

231
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:12,125
You know it's my office.

232
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,500
We should definitely
continue our sessions.

233
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,417
You stay calm
and the police won't bother us.

234
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:25,083
Right now, the medical doctor
and the patient are consulting,

235
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:27,292
<i>so I am afraid I must ask,</i>

236
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,167
please stay away, and wait for now.

237
00:16:31,292 --> 00:16:32,542
So, un-cuff him and leave now.

238
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:40,875
OK, Captain.

239
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,719
If I make a signal with my hand,
go in there.

240
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,583
Today will be our last session.

241
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,458
I'll tell you the answer
that I promised I would.

242
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:55,250
So, each morning,
I put a 100 seeds into that bottle.

243
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,042
<i>And then I started to count.</i>

244
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,833
How many seeds there were?

245
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:02,292
But Guo Zhida had started to eat.

246
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,708
Thirty-two from 168.

247
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,792
It was simple.

248
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,917
I should be the house in this game.

249
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,208
OK.

250
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,125
<i>Why don't we relax for the day?</i>

251
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,125
<i>Watch the game.</i>

252
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,250
It's fine. We can watch and wait.

253
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,018
<i>It seems that there is something wrong</i>

254
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,625
<i>with the list of players
playing on the second Asia World Cup game.</i>

255
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:28,083
<i>Li Zhiyu is on team Ju Yuan,</i>

256
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,087
<i>and a starting defender
is missing from the list.</i>

257
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:32,851
<i>Now, that's surprising
that there is a missing point on the list.</i>

258
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,333
<i>But it would appear so...</i>

259
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,625
That stupid coach.

260
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,250
<i>Number ten Li Zhiyu... No...</i>

261
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,000
Do you know how hard I planned?

262
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,875
Li Zhiyu is not on the list.

263
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:42,992
<i>You kidnapped Li Zhiyu's wife.</i>

264
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,083
- So, how can he play the match?
- I'm helping him.

265
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,000
I know why he didn't make the goal.

266
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,583
He doesn't know
why he's playing the match.

267
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,083
So, now I'll have to tell him.

268
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:55,917
Kidnapping his wife is not threatening.
He needs to cheer up.

269
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:58,000
Stop whining, it's all just for love.

270
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,750
OK.

271
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,208
I understand.

272
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,625
You need to sit. Calm down.

273
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,167
<i>Just relax.</i>

274
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,958
<i>You can keep eating sunflower seeds,
it will calm you. I have no other snacks.</i>

275
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,708
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

276
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,042
Why is that?

277
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:21,833
I think because you are upset.

278
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,292
Calm down,
I think your brain needs Tryptophan.

279
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,667
You probably just burned
a whole lot of carbohydrates.

280
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,708
I bet that you must be really hungry.

281
00:18:32,292 --> 00:18:33,292
Am I right?

282
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,083
Yes.

283
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:37,292
A little.

284
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,000
I ate lunch very early.

285
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:40,917
What time did you eat lunch?

286
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,750
Around 11:00.

287
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,292
Dumpling and some duck blood noodles.

288
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,917
<i>Do you still eat takeout?</i>

289
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:49,958
<i>Yes, I am scared of eating in restaurants.</i>

290
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:51,643
They're just talking about
what they'd like to eat.

291
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:52,747
<i>Do you want to bet on that?</i>

292
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,458
- What they like to eat?
<i>- Maybe I should eat dumplings again.</i>

293
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:58,226
- Yeah. She will mess everything up.
<i>- Order noodles, fried beans, meat sauce.</i>

294
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,500
- Yep, I'd probably bet on that.
<i>- No.</i>

295
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:03,208
<i>I think I'll have dumplings.</i>

296
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,708
<i>You should try the duck noodles.</i>

297
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,000
<i>I eat that every time.</i>

298
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,833
<i>I always think they are very delicious.</i>

299
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,684
- Bring me the Seoul map.
<i>- It's always been one of my favorites.</i>

300
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:12,958
I am getting it.

301
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:15,250
I think I am gonna order something now.

302
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:18,833
Hold on.

303
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,292
Dr. Yang...

304
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,042
you're losing your mind.

305
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,625
You didn't ask me
the number for the restaurant.

306
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:33,750
2671-8266.

307
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,500
You know, I also order takeout a lot.

308
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,500
This takeout place only delivers

309
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:47,583
within three kilometers
from their location.

310
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,500
Take this and go
to Chungwon Chinese restaurant.

311
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,667
Check who ordered
duck noodles this morning.

312
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,333
I think the hostage
is being held somewhere nearby.

313
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:57,833
Right. I understand.

314
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,292
Dr. Yang, thank you.

315
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,542
She is paying for the Chinese food today.

316
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,792
No, thank you.

317
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,417
For three years, I have used the name
of paper companies to hide money

318
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:17,958
in banks, secret bank accounts
and secret trust companies.

319
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,708
Company name, representative and password.

320
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,167
These are things saved on a USB.

321
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,083
Today's earning is two million

322
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:27,333
and then the two million dollars
are deposited.

323
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:30,708
With this black key,
you can withdraw money at anytime.

324
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:34,208
I assure you that everything
I just said is totally legal.

325
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:35,958
OK, go.

326
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,500
You're wasting my time.

327
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:39,583
Fine.

328
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,125
Yeah, I found it.

329
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,583
I also found out that the noodles
were all ordered from here too.

330
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,667
And the delivery man said that

331
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,792
the person that ordered
was wearing a mask. I remember that.

332
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:38,417
What are you gonna do with Guo Zhida?

333
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:41,458
I don't think that's your business.

334
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,417
What are you doing this afternoon?

335
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,250
I have a personal matter.

336
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:48,292
That's gonna be difficult.

337
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,458
You need to make a statement
down at the police station.

338
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,833
With all that's happened,
you're under suspicion.

339
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,125
Go on.

340
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:08,667
Focus.

341
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,708
Today is the day we need to deliver.

342
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:14,375
We need to get the money to the gamblers

343
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,167
and we need some tight security.

344
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,500
Don't you worry about that.

345
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:20,417
I knew that you'd worry
so I hired 30 extra guards.

346
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Look at them now.

347
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,000
Look sharp. Do your jobs.

348
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,500
Don't worry about the security.

349
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,750
Not even a mosquito
can get into the building.

350
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:38,458
Yeah. Our four casinos
have already been busted.

351
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:49,375
Police or anyone else.

352
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,833
I am going to kill all of them.

353
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:01,125
Dr. Yang.

354
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,792
Are you on the same team as them?

355
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:08,708
Don't forget.
I am a doctor, and you're my patient.

356
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,000
We are on the same team.

357
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:45,167
One.

358
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Two.

359
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,750
Three.

360
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:29,375
<i>The hostage wasn't hurt at all.</i>

361
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,542
<i>It appears that she was only quite scared.</i>

362
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:34,125
<i>She was taken away to the hospital
to be examined.</i>

363
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,458
Tell them that the hostage is secured.

364
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,625
And tell team one to follow
the ambulance closely,

365
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,042
and get the hostage's
statement as soon as you can.

366
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:43,167
I am on it, sir.

367
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:47,208
Don't touch the switches or the cords, OK?

368
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:49,500
- Because it can explode.
- I hear you, sir.

369
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:33,458
I think that this is the floor plan
of the stadium.

370
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:36,417
But why on the wall?

371
00:25:37,292 --> 00:25:38,958
Why did they draw there?

372
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,833
But why draw a stadium?

373
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,625
Hey, Captain. Look at this.

374
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,083
This is TNT.

375
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:58,208
Everything on the table
is incredibly explosive.

376
00:25:58,333 --> 00:25:59,833
Make sure not to touch it.

377
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,208
Captain Jiang.

378
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:05,792
On the list of purchasing items here,

379
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,250
a huge amount of chemicals is missing.

380
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:11,083
Most of them are already
made into explosives.

381
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,875
How many bombs can we make
that are like the one on the hostage

382
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:15,375
with these chemicals?

383
00:26:17,417 --> 00:26:18,417
About five.

384
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,208
Do you think all the bombs are here?

385
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,500
You have to look for them to know.

386
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,292
<i>Babe, I love you.</i>

387
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,792
Could you sign for me here, please?

388
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,542
Your treatment is over.

389
00:26:57,042 --> 00:26:59,250
I'll bring your diagnosis to the court.

390
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:02,792
And the diagnosis will prove
you are not mentally accountable.

391
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,042
An speaking.

392
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,101
Are you saying
the mental institution's better?

393
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,125
What?

394
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,750
- I think it's better for you.
- Where is that?

395
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,208
And the team?

396
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:23,917
What's this?

397
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,000
That is for the police department.

398
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:31,583
I guess the bomb went off.

399
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:32,667
Stop.

400
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,625
Tell me where the rest of the bombs are?

401
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,125
You tell me first.

402
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:42,625
Just how many people died.

403
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,083
You think, you are a winner,
but the game is just starting.

404
00:28:14,958 --> 00:28:16,750
- Look for it inside.
- Yeah, I got it.

405
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:20,417
- Pull.
<i>- Attention, support vehicles!</i>

406
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,667
<i>Attention, support vehicles!</i>

407
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,550
<i>There was an explosion
in the main team room.</i>

408
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:27,500
<i>We need ambulance</i>

409
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:28,750
<i>on the spot.</i>

410
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:30,667
<i>- We need ambulances. Now!</i>
- Are you OK?

411
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,417
<i>We are into Second quarter.</i>

412
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,333
<i>Team Goyang Shinsung and Team Guangzhou
Ju Yuan players are entering.</i>

413
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,167
Is the new plan a bomb?

414
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:43,917
It was only a bet.

415
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,917
Good. And what's the bet about?

416
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,708
We're betting on who's going to win.

417
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:51,542
Is it Shinsung
or is it going to be Ju Yuan?

418
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,375
And what do you get if you win the bet?

419
00:28:56,042 --> 00:28:57,125
What's funny?

420
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,833
You probably just hide it
because you won't talk.

421
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:02,500
You probably never won once in your life

422
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,917
and you lived like a loser
through all your life.

423
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,958
Do you even know what winning is like?

424
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,208
Should I tell you the answer now?

425
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:16,458
You just wanted
to be like your own brother.

426
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:18,208
That's your subconsciousness.

427
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,000
You think, you're a burden to him.

428
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:22,708
Your brother always took care of you.

429
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:25,292
Do you know why he did that?

430
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:26,375
He felt sorry for you.

431
00:29:26,417 --> 00:29:29,833
No, Dr. Yang, you won't stop the bomb.
I mean that.

432
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,042
Go on and say what you want to say to me,

433
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:35,083
but it won't stop the bomb from exploding.

434
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:39,875
I am not a cop. I don't fall
for the usual things that they do.

435
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:43,542
I already know you well,
and I won't fall for all that.

436
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:46,833
You are a loser
because you won't accept that you lost.

437
00:29:47,042 --> 00:29:48,042
Shut up!

438
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:52,083
You know what I think,
there is no other bomb.

439
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:55,458
You didn't use the bomb to threaten,
but to cover your shame.

440
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:57,862
<i>- You did all of this just to win a bet.</i>
- That's bullshit.

441
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,601
- You said, you know everything.
- Do you really have to keep talking?

442
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:03,101
- You're wrong. You're the real loser.
- You're just like the team Ju Yuan.

443
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:05,018
- You'll see. There's only 90 minutes left.
- You're gonna be just like them.

444
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:07,333
You listen to me,
the bomb is in the stadium.

445
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,667
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

446
00:30:09,458 --> 00:30:10,792
My bet is not on the bomb.

447
00:30:11,583 --> 00:30:14,000
It is on the 50,000 lives.

448
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:29,792
Where are you?

449
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,375
What was that?

450
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,792
The stadium?

451
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:40,917
One team will keep the press out

452
00:30:41,375 --> 00:30:43,375
and stop them from getting in the way.

453
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:46,458
The other team investigates
the residence by questioning.

454
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:49,083
Everyone else follow me,
we need to get to the stadium.

455
00:30:49,167 --> 00:30:51,667
The stadium?
But we haven't finished everything yet.

456
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:56,917
The bombs aren't here.
They are at the stadium.

457
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:16,542
Who gave you that info?
Are you sure it's correct?

458
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,208
Yes, sir, it's correct.

459
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:20,500
Dr. Yang gave me the info.

460
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,042
Dr. Yang and Guo Zhida were talking
on the way to the police station

461
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:26,750
and that's when
he confessed it all by himself.

462
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,625
Then why is it that you are here?
Why aren't you stopping the game?

463
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,125
OK.

464
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,833
Don't you stop the game, Captain Jiang.

465
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:34,167
Can we talk?

466
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,583
I need just a moment.

467
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,083
Major.

468
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,792
This has come from the highest authority.

469
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:47,292
We can't afford to lose the stadium.
The Olympics are coming.

470
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:49,632
The world will think
that the Republic of Korea

471
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,667
will not be able to host the Olympics.
Imagine.

472
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,330
But don't worry about that.

473
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,750
The NIS will take care of this.

474
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,208
Turn him over.
We can just give him to them.

475
00:32:04,333 --> 00:32:06,625
- Where are you going?
- To organize the data.

476
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,250
Don't do that, sir.

477
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,083
No. Stop, sir.

478
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,208
- Be patient!
- Let go!

479
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:20,292
Move.

480
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,000
- Sir.
- Be patient.

481
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,083
Calm down.

482
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:26,125
Stop fighting!

483
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,708
Do you have some cash?

484
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:41,833
He has the Cain complex.

485
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:43,639
He always lost out to his brother in life.

486
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,351
Their parents always
preferred his brother.

487
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:48,208
He got to go to America,
and inherited all their money.

488
00:32:48,292 --> 00:32:50,917
Gambling, kidnapping and bombing...

489
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,083
He always wanted to have the attention.

490
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:56,184
If Zhida was an angel,
he still couldn't be as good.

491
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:58,000
So, in the end he just decided to be evil.

492
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,333
Dr. Yang, it's too dangerous in here.

493
00:33:01,417 --> 00:33:02,583
I am gonna take you out.

494
00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:04,625
You can't do this.

495
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,750
You came here to ask my help
and now you're kicking me out.

496
00:33:07,958 --> 00:33:09,417
I helped you find the hostage.

497
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,292
I also found out about the bomb.

498
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:12,667
And what did the police do?

499
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:14,583
Well, first they took my phone away

500
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:15,667
- and then...
- Fine.

501
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,875
I'll give you another chance.

502
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:19,500
But tell me what your theory is.

503
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,250
Guo Zhida said that
it will be his special plan.

504
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:26,208
To him this is nothing but fun and games.
He wants to show his brother that he won.

505
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
To win?

506
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:28,500
Against who?

507
00:33:28,583 --> 00:33:31,083
The police, all the gamblers and everyone.

508
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,917
So, tell me what your plan is.

509
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:35,167
He likes to bet.

510
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:36,917
So, I think we should.

511
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,542
Do you want to choose what to bet on?

512
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,833
You said you wanted to be the house.

513
00:33:45,208 --> 00:33:46,500
Well, I will be the ref.

514
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:48,375
I will do it and fairly.

515
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,083
What if he wins?

516
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,458
Tell me the bomb's location.

517
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:53,458
If he loses?

518
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,250
The cops will go to team Ju Yuan.

519
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,542
Tell Li Zhiyu he's playing.

520
00:33:56,958 --> 00:34:01,958
Li Zhiyu will run as fast as he can
because 50,000 people depend on it.

521
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:11,500
Is this what you do
to change the situation?

522
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:14,375
So captain Jiang...

523
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:16,208
Do you enjoy your soccer?

524
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:21,000
If not for you, I'd be watching the game,
and enjoying a nice cold beer.

525
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,375
Fine, then let's bet on soccer questions.

526
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:24,458
Fair enough.

527
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:27,042
You know Cristiano Ronaldo well,
don't you?

528
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,167
Guess the name of his son.

529
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,458
And just what kind of questions are these?

530
00:34:32,542 --> 00:34:33,622
Are you saying you give up?

531
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,792
The question is strange.
Why don't you give him a hint?

532
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,208
Fine.

533
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,250
You can call one person and then ask them.

534
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:51,667
Call someone.

535
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,458
Put it on the speaker phone.

536
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:58,292
ZHANG LIN

537
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:03,250
<i>Hello, who is it?</i>

538
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:05,417
Who is this?

539
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,417
<i>Well, I am a friend of Zhang Lin.</i>

540
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,917
<i>She's in the shower. Who are you?</i>

541
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,500
I'll tell her to call you.

542
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:13,833
That's OK.

543
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:16,500
<i>- Who's on the phone?
- It's unlisted, I don't know.</i>

544
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,250
<i>Hold on, here she is.</i>

545
00:35:19,292 --> 00:35:21,167
<i>Hello. Who is it? Who is this?</i>

546
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:24,125
It's me.

547
00:35:24,375 --> 00:35:25,750
<i>Jiang Chengjun?</i>

548
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,167
<i>You called me. Today is the deadline.</i>

549
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,750
<i>I asked the lawyer.</i>

550
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:33,292
<i>He said that even
if you don't show up in court tomorrow,</i>

551
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:34,768
<i>the divorce agreement will be valid.</i>

552
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:37,750
If I am still alive tonight,
I'll divorce you tomorrow.

553
00:35:37,917 --> 00:35:38,917
<i>What was that?</i>

554
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,292
I cannot explain it right now.

555
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,292
I am working, but I need your help.

556
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,708
<i>You are always working,
so I am gonna hang-up.</i>

557
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:48,250
Don't hang-up the phone.

558
00:35:48,417 --> 00:35:50,667
Listen!
Will you listen to what I am saying?

559
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,625
<i>That's great. Finally, you tell me
not to hang-up the phone.</i>

560
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:57,208
<i>- You were always the one that'd hang-up.</i>
- I am sorry.

561
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:58,917
I guess I am a bad person.

562
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,708
Just answer this question.
50,000 people's lives depend on it.

563
00:36:02,792 --> 00:36:06,208
<i>- Are you drunk again?</i>
- What is Cristiano Ronaldo's son's name?

564
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,292
Did you just hear that?

565
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:18,000
Don't ever be with a Korean man.

566
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:20,917
Korean men aren't
like the men in the dramas.

567
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,500
They always drink after work.
They always hit their wives.

568
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,375
Captain Jiang.

569
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,667
Your wife left you
because you beat her, right?

570
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,417
She knows soccer?

571
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,208
She happens to be a fan of Ronaldo.

572
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:37,792
What about your wife?

573
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:40,667
Oh, no! You say she's your ex.

574
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:42,500
No...

575
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:45,125
Because your are not divorced,
she's still your wife.

576
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:50,708
What do you think
your wife said about you to that man?

577
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:55,292
What do you think
the two of them will do tonight?

578
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,167
I try to catch men like you
which is why I could never see my wife.

579
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,958
- He's doing it on purpose.
- Guess what, so am I.

580
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,292
Where is the bomb?

581
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:17,292
Aiming a gun at someone's head...

582
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:18,750
Exciting, isn't it?

583
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:22,333
Like the bomb in the soccer stadium
is completely in my hands.

584
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:25,167
Feels like I have
all the power in the world.

585
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:26,583
How cool is that?

586
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:29,542
Tell me, where is the bomb?

587
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:30,667
Do you wanna bet?

588
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,250
You're gonna shoot? Hurry up.

589
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:35,250
If I die, you'll be a hero.

590
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:38,226
- Enough! Will you keep your mouth shut?
- If I die you'll get a promotion.

591
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,167
Just kill me.

592
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,542
Kill me and you can bring Zhang Lin back.

593
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,833
Here, you have a text from Zhang Lin.

594
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:56,625
Zhang Lin?

595
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:05,083
"Cristiano Ronaldo Jr."

596
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,917
And now you reply to your wife.

597
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:16,833
Just text her, "Thank you."

598
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:19,500
Thank you because she saved my life.

599
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,333
I'll take you to the stadium.
I will take you to the bomb.

600
00:38:25,042 --> 00:38:26,042
Both of us?

601
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,458
The game is starting now.

602
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:31,000
The referees can't leave.

603
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:40,125
The suspect has chosen the rules.

604
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,167
The suspect, Dr. Yang, and myself
are the ones that can be inside.

605
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,417
<i>The cops must not
expose themselves at all.</i>

606
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,375
<i>He'll blow up the bomb
if he sees any police on the scene.</i>

607
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:52,375
I know it's crazy,
but in this case we have to.

608
00:38:52,917 --> 00:38:54,958
<i>We need to do whatever is necessary now.</i>

609
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,583
<i>Listen, all you have to do
is find the bomb.</i>

610
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:01,059
<i>You don't have to take care of it.</i>

611
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,083
<i>If you can find the location,
just report it.</i>

612
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,167
<i>The bomb squad will take care of the bomb.</i>

613
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,250
<i>If there are any problems,</i>

614
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:09,833
<i>you know that everything will be
all on you.</i>

615
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:12,667
<i>All on you. It is all on you.</i>

616
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:21,393
WE LOVE YOU WHILE YOU FIGHT FOR IT

617
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:24,875
<i>Goyang is possessing the ball
a lot longer than team Ju Yuan.</i>

618
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:28,583
<i>The ball is now held by Shinsung
and it's a pass.</i>

619
00:39:30,292 --> 00:39:33,625
<i>Another pass again.
That kind of play deserves to be carded.</i>

620
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,500
<i>Wild Cat, the entrance
to the stadium is clear.</i>

621
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:42,750
<i>The referee is taking out a yellow card.</i>

622
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,417
<i>He's let a lot slide.</i>

623
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:48,042
<i>The players from team Ju Yuan
are surrounding him.</i>

624
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,292
GO NEW STAR SIN SUNG FC,
LOVE TAEHO KIM

625
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,375
Go through to Bleacher A.

626
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:59,667
Wild Cat, keep your distance.
Eagle, be prepared.

627
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:03,292
Eagle here, prepare to shoot the bird.

628
00:40:09,958 --> 00:40:11,599
The bomb is in the middle of the stadium.

629
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:13,042
But where?

630
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Wear it.

631
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:19,833
If not, give it to Dr. Yang.

632
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,417
Shinsung, you suck!

633
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:32,500
Go, Ju Yuan! Go, my team!

634
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:33,667
Just what are you doing?

635
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,583
Listen, if you want the bomb,
you will do as I say.

636
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:37,827
You will do as I tell you to.

637
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,500
Hey, Shinsung, you suck!

638
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,375
Say it louder.

639
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,083
Shinsung, your players suck!

640
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:05,542
Hey, babe, look. What is he doing?

641
00:41:09,792 --> 00:41:11,417
You tell me, where the bomb is.

642
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:13,875
Hey, listen to me...

643
00:41:13,958 --> 00:41:16,542
You keep talking
and then walking straight,

644
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,750
until I tell you the location of the bomb.

645
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,125
Dr, Yang, I need a favor.

646
00:41:21,542 --> 00:41:24,292
Don't miss a word of what
this guy is saying and report it

647
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,583
Shinsung, your team sucks!

648
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:36,792
You're crazy.

649
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:39,042
- You crazy bastard.
- Die.

650
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:41,292
- That guy.
- Shinsung, you suck!

651
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:43,500
- Hey, get down!
- Bastard.

652
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:44,583
Bastard.

653
00:41:50,583 --> 00:41:52,292
Shinsung, your team sucks!

654
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,750
Now stop.

655
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Now he needs to go two blocks forward.

656
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:03,643
He says you need to go two more blocks.

657
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:09,708
And now you tell him
if he punches that big guy,

658
00:42:09,792 --> 00:42:11,625
he'll know just where the bomb is.

659
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:13,125
He told me...

660
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:17,475
that you should punch the fat guy,
then you will know where it is.

661
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:18,792
What the hell do you want?

662
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:21,000
You're such a bastard.

663
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:24,375
I told you everything,
do whatever you want.

664
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:28,792
- What do you want?
- What the hell?

665
00:42:31,417 --> 00:42:32,458
Hey, look at that bastard.

666
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,750
Get that bastard.

667
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:34,917
Hey, get over here.

668
00:42:35,458 --> 00:42:37,542
Where the hell is this
that you dress like that?

669
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,792
Look at that guy!

670
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:41,875
Get him.

671
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,167
Who do you think you are?

672
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,891
- Bastard. Get him!
- That's what you get.

673
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:47,667
<i>The referee stands by his call.</i>

674
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,958
<i>Goyang Shinsung free kicks
near the penalty area.</i>

675
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:52,542
<i>Number seven player Ha Junggee
kicks the ball.</i>

676
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:53,708
Goal!

677
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:14,333
I found it.

678
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:22,375
I have the bomb.

679
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:24,833
- I have found the bomb.
<i>- All right, be careful.</i>

680
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:26,667
<i>The bomb squad will be here soon.</i>

681
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:27,792
SHIN-SEONG VS. GI-WON

682
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:31,042
Are you OK?

683
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:33,208
- Thank you.
- Thank who?

684
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,333
You need to thank team Shinsung.

685
00:43:35,958 --> 00:43:37,958
You're alive because they scored a goal.

686
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:42,083
Where's the next location?

687
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:00,792
There isn't a bomb.

688
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:03,233
I never said there was a bomb here.

689
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,500
Did they poison the noodles, I wonder?

690
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:09,125
I am about to burst.

691
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,625
Why is he losing the game?

692
00:44:26,208 --> 00:44:27,250
What's that?

693
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,958
Wouldn't you say that
Guo Zhida is losing the game?

694
00:44:32,375 --> 00:44:33,875
If he give up the bomb,

695
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:37,667
he can't threaten Ju Yuan
to win the game anymore.

696
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,042
He's worked so hard on a big plan.

697
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:42,292
He lost the game because of Ronaldo's son.

698
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:43,542
Is that normal?

699
00:44:45,292 --> 00:44:48,500
Mentally ill people
always believe in their own answer.

700
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:51,292
We can't possibly try and understand.

701
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:52,792
I don't buy it.

702
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:56,583
My experience says that
he's not gonna be so easy to solve.

703
00:44:59,375 --> 00:45:01,125
You mustn't always doubt everything.

704
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:03,875
You probably think
that you are workaholic,

705
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:06,542
but it's not that.

706
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,208
It's more like marital problems,

707
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:12,042
that's why I have the personality I do.

708
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,167
Try to trust in people.

709
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,917
Are you saying I should trust that creep?

710
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:18,500
Just trust me.

711
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:30,167
Where are the rest of the bombs?

712
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:33,250
If you tell the rest,
I'll take you to the bombs.

713
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:35,167
Don't forget the rules here.

714
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:37,500
If you lose, you have to tell us where.

715
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:40,000
I didn't agree to all of the bombs
for one game.

716
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:45,042
The rule of the game is that
if you get one question right,

717
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:47,792
I will tell you one location of one bomb.

718
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:51,292
You need to calm down.

719
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,917
Don't argue, let's start.
Ask the question.

720
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:55,917
Go on.

721
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:59,500
Captain Jiang seems
like he's eager to play.

722
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:01,708
OK. The betting is very simple.

723
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:04,417
First, you take out your gun,
aim at her head,

724
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,458
then you shoot and then you win.

725
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:14,625
Dr. Yang, you said that you knew me well.

726
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:16,875
You decided that I am mentally ill.

727
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,125
Did you imagine that
I could play this game?

728
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:27,542
You still think you're lucky.

729
00:46:28,042 --> 00:46:30,000
How many lives do you think
you can save now?

730
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,208
How about 50,000 if you just kill one?

731
00:46:36,167 --> 00:46:37,167
Captain Jiang.

732
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,500
You're not...

733
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,250
You're not considering this bet, are you?

734
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:49,167
If I shoot the gun,
how do I know you'll keep your end?

735
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:50,583
You wouldn't know.

736
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:52,792
That's what betting makes so exciting.

737
00:47:09,542 --> 00:47:12,750
Don't you understand?
You're supposed to kill the doctor.

738
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,833
You only told me to shoot her in the head.

739
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,542
But you never said to load it.

740
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:27,500
But it's loaded now.

741
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:30,542
Referee.

742
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:33,375
Do you agree?

743
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:51,167
Where is the bomb?

744
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:56,167
Under your foot.

745
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:59,042
<i>Huang Bo Chao
steps inside the penalty line.</i>

746
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:00,583
<i>It's a fair tackle.</i>

747
00:48:22,042 --> 00:48:23,708
How come the bomb is hidden here?

748
00:48:24,042 --> 00:48:27,583
It's a certain millimeter gas pipe.
This goes all over Seoul.

749
00:48:27,667 --> 00:48:30,667
If the bomb explodes,
it will be a huge disaster.

750
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:34,042
The bomb's set to blow
at the end of the match, so...

751
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:35,333
If Shinsung wins,

752
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,667
it'll be a big surprise
for all of the people.

753
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:39,917
Shut up!

754
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,000
We've found the bomb.

755
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,833
What's the situation like?

756
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:50,458
<i>It's pretty chaotic over here.</i>

757
00:48:50,792 --> 00:48:53,208
<i>It's pretty difficult to get
rid of it, you see.</i>

758
00:48:53,458 --> 00:48:56,292
<i>- The bomb is attached to the pipe.</i>
- Can't you just detach it?

759
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:02,333
<i>The bomb is attached below the pipe,
so it's unreachable.</i>

760
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:05,333
<i>I think we have to ask assistance
from the city, sir.</i>

761
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:07,417
<i>A corner kick.</i>

762
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:09,667
<i>Closing in. So close.</i>

763
00:49:09,875 --> 00:49:11,375
<i>There's a goal!</i>

764
00:49:11,458 --> 00:49:15,000
<i>The players' teamwork was incredible.
The stadium is chaotic.</i>

765
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:17,375
<i>The fans and players are excited.</i>

766
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:20,250
<i>It already looks like
they've won the championship.</i>

767
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,833
There's just one more question,
then you can show us as promised.

768
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:28,042
You wanna lose that quickly?

769
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,042
You will never win.

770
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:34,792
You're wrong.

771
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:37,625
I will win.

772
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:41,625
You're not going to be able to answer it.
Here's the last one though.

773
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:45,125
What's more important,
now arrest me or get the bomb?

774
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:47,292
It makes no sense. That isn't a question.

775
00:49:47,375 --> 00:49:49,042
The question is too subjective.

776
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,292
You always say I am wrong,
so there's no need to answer it.

777
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:59,792
The area is secured,
I will find it without your help.

778
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,208
But you have to follow the rules.

779
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,542
Dr. Yang, guard him with a gun.

780
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:06,500
I will find the bomb.

781
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,708
If he even moves a little,
then you shoot him.

782
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
<i>The gas pipes
from the district are closed.</i>

783
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:24,292
<i>What about the section of the pipe?</i>

784
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:25,979
<i>Try to cut off the part with the bomb.</i>

785
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:31,125
<i>If we do that,
the bomb will vibrate and explode.</i>

786
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:33,292
What's the safest way you think?

787
00:50:34,208 --> 00:50:36,000
<i>We have to cut that section off.</i>

788
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:40,125
<i>If that leaves us room,
then we can try and detach the bomb, sir.</i>

789
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:56,545
OPERATION PROHIBITED EXCEPT FOR
ELECTRICAL WORKER. BE CAREFUL ELECTRICITY.

790
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:05,875
I found something that looks like a bomb.

791
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:08,042
It's in the basement called South Hallway.

792
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:09,500
I am gonna take a look.

793
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:46,625
Winner.

794
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,167
It's best if you be careful.

795
00:51:48,583 --> 00:51:52,000
If the marbles roll up and down, and left,
the bomb will explode.

796
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:54,542
I don't need assistance, please stay away.

797
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,292
What about you?

798
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:00,958
It's the last bomb anyway.
I guess I am gonna die with this bastard.

799
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,792
The bomb explodes, the bastard will die.

800
00:52:05,625 --> 00:52:07,875
It's upgraded with American equipment.

801
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,125
It's heavy, right?

802
00:52:09,375 --> 00:52:12,250
Can you hold on
until the police gets here, Captain.

803
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:16,809
- Tell me how to disable it.
- Do you think I am afraid of dying?

804
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:19,125
If you die before us,
then you'll be the loser.

805
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:32,000
You see the knob on the right?

806
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:34,333
The magnetic pole is installed behind it.

807
00:52:34,667 --> 00:52:37,458
As soon as the knob is lose,
the magnetic pole will divide.

808
00:52:38,042 --> 00:52:40,250
Then the trigger device will not work.

809
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:48,583
That makes sense because he's not stupid.

810
00:52:53,167 --> 00:52:54,375
Believe it or not.

811
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:07,625
Dr. Yang, you're not responsible
for saving my life.

812
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:08,792
Hurry up and go.

813
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,708
And you're not going to tell me
what to do.

814
00:54:16,542 --> 00:54:17,917
Yang Xi, are you all right?

815
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:22,625
- I can't see anything.
- It's all right. It's just the flash.

816
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,958
Close your eyes and it will be fine.
Give that to me.

817
00:54:25,792 --> 00:54:27,000
You just wait here.

818
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:21,000
<i>Goyang Shinsung is winning the game
against Guangzhou Ju Yuan by 2-0.</i>

819
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:22,583
<i>The first quarter ends at 45 minutes.</i>

820
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,750
Captain Jiang.

821
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:41,125
Are you OK?

822
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:43,458
Is that woman the psychologist?

823
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:45,167
What do you think about Dr. Yang?

824
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:47,750
Such a disappointment.

825
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:49,792
The doctor's unqualified.

826
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:53,500
Our brother's misery was prolonged.
She was responsible.

827
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,583
Then tell me,
why is it that you chose her?

828
00:55:56,958 --> 00:55:58,167
She had a lower fee.

829
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,583
What were you doing
that made you arrive so late?

830
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:05,250
I arrived late
because I was attempting to get a loan

831
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:06,458
and then my phone was dead.

832
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:09,750
So, I charged the phone in my house,
then I found out I had some missed calls.

833
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:12,250
So, I called. He said I needed to come.

834
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:16,083
The suspect is in the stadium.

835
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:19,083
We are now going to guard
every entrance into here.

836
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:22,125
Search everyone that goes through the gate
and tries to exit.

837
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:25,292
The search team
will examine everything in this place.

838
00:56:25,417 --> 00:56:27,000
- We get it.
- Yes, sir. Right away.

839
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:30,042
My brother cause a lot of chaos.
Please don't shoot him, all right.

840
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,917
Listen, I will try to persuade him.

841
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,083
So, now we all now.

842
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:37,625
Zhida won't blow up the third bomb
because there isn't a bomb in the gym.

843
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:39,833
Don't you see this wasn't his point?

844
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,167
I know.

845
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:45,042
What's going on?

846
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:48,167
Get that lady out of here.

847
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,958
- Now hold on.
- Stop there, OK?

848
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:57,750
What are you doing?

849
00:56:57,958 --> 00:57:02,000
The people are assuming that the situation
was a plot between you and Zhida.

850
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:03,833
My boss and I already talked.

851
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,417
And you need to be questioned,
I am taking you now.

852
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,792
Get that woman to talk
as much as possible.

853
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:26,708
I know that you can't hide
anything from them.

854
00:57:30,042 --> 00:57:31,500
Let me ask one more thing.

855
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:35,333
Your brother told you to bet
on team Ju Yuan. Isn't that true?

856
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:38,542
No, that didn't happen.

857
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,917
We haven't talked from a long time.

858
00:57:45,208 --> 00:57:46,250
Look, I'll tell you...

859
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:47,708
My brother's a gambler.

860
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:49,417
Or have you forgotten?

861
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:51,167
You fell for it.

862
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,750
What are you so sad about?

863
00:59:02,958 --> 00:59:04,417
Because he used me.

864
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,125
He gave you a hint
about the hostage and the bomb...

865
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:10,167
so that you'd believe me.

866
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:13,000
You all believe he's insane.

867
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,167
What are you looking at?

868
00:59:28,917 --> 00:59:30,708
Well, one thing you said is true.

869
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,833
Guo Zhida's motive isn't the stadium.

870
00:59:34,417 --> 00:59:36,875
And the 50,000 people
that were here are safe.

871
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:40,542
So then really...
we haven't lost the game.

872
00:59:48,625 --> 00:59:50,958
It's right here. I'll take over now.

873
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:06,625
This is all the information we've got.

874
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:12,250
Who does this belong to?

875
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:13,833
That is Dr. Yang's.

876
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:20,042
After she was under arrest,
did she try and make contact with anyone?

877
01:00:21,333 --> 01:00:24,708
I think there was one phone call
and she had problems with that.

878
01:00:25,375 --> 01:00:27,917
She couldn't answer her phone
because it was already broken.

879
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,875
Find out the last person who called

880
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:32,958
- and check their phone.
- OK, I will.

881
01:00:34,333 --> 01:00:35,333
Hello.

882
01:00:43,583 --> 01:00:45,583
Hello, sir. Did you call me?

883
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:47,708
Someone said that they saw Guo Zhihua.

884
01:00:47,958 --> 01:00:50,208
He was very close to Goyang Stadium.

885
01:00:50,583 --> 01:00:52,500
So, I guess he wants to die.

886
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:54,667
I'll go find him immediately.

887
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:01,167
Commissioner, we got the phone number.

888
01:01:01,667 --> 01:01:03,292
- Well, dial it already.
- Yes, sir.

889
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:10,542
<i>Thank you for getting
the contact information for Abel,</i>

890
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:11,958
<i>the plastic surgery clinic.</i>

891
01:01:12,208 --> 01:01:13,958
<i>Our Abel Plastic Surgery Clinic</i>

892
01:01:14,042 --> 01:01:16,708
<i>has the best techniques and service
for our customers,</i>

893
01:01:16,792 --> 01:01:19,375
<i>and we are currently underway
to make a prettier future</i>

894
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,000
<i>for a prettier you.</i>

895
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,250
So...

896
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:34,875
This is all that I have.
Remember, the ref blows the whistle.

897
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:45,875
<i>The second half of the game is starting.</i>

898
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:48,417
Ju Yuan's forward Li Zhiyu
runs and takes it.

899
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:51,292
Number 10 player is now on the field.

900
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:55,458
<i>The second half is expected
to see game-changing moments.</i>

901
01:01:55,542 --> 01:01:57,292
<i>Li Zhiyu's condition appears good.</i>

902
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,208
<i>That would appear so.
He seems very energetic.</i>

903
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:02,042
<i>Team players still believe in him.</i>

904
01:02:02,167 --> 01:02:04,708
<i>He shoots... It's bad.</i>

905
01:02:05,042 --> 01:02:06,958
<i>It barely made it. Whatever!</i>

906
01:02:07,042 --> 01:02:09,000
<i>Team Ju Yuan is finally attacking.</i>

907
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:11,542
This will soon be ground zero.

908
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,000
It was Zhida's home.

909
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:16,250
You know him better,
so now I need your help.

910
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:18,792
It's the beginning of part two.

911
01:02:19,917 --> 01:02:23,333
And whatever we do,
I know we cannot lose this one this time.

912
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:34,000
- Did you take all pictures?
- Yes, I did.

913
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,958
- Has the TNT inspection been done?
- Yes, sir.

914
01:02:37,042 --> 01:02:38,708
We can put some samples in here.

915
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:43,000
This looks like the stadium.

916
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:46,083
This is the soccer stadium.

917
01:02:46,167 --> 01:02:49,125
Next is the sports complex,
with four gates to the north,

918
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:50,458
south, west, and to the east.

919
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,833
But there seems to be something missing.

920
01:03:04,625 --> 01:03:05,875
Can this be right?

921
01:03:42,833 --> 01:03:47,708
Inspector An, find data
for the JCP electrical building.

922
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:49,333
I'll send you the address.

923
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:52,667
Look at this.

924
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,667
What is the content of this form?

925
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,583
It's a form for bus rentals.

926
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:13,542
<i>Li Zhiyu is on the chase.
He passes the ball.</i>

927
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:15,667
<i>It seems to be working. He's inside.</i>

928
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:18,167
<i>He shoots and scores.</i>

929
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,042
<i>This truly is the skill of team Ju Yuan.</i>

930
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:23,208
<i>Ju Yuan is only trailing
by one point. Two to one.</i>

931
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:45,042
Guo Zhida.

932
01:04:46,542 --> 01:04:47,958
You crazy fool.

933
01:04:48,042 --> 01:04:50,917
Why're you going around like a mad man?
Where's your brother?

934
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:52,708
Look at that lamp.

935
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:56,333
Does it look a little weird?

936
01:04:56,917 --> 01:04:58,083
I meant that the lamp...

937
01:04:58,542 --> 01:04:59,750
is in a strange spot.

938
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:01,125
Then what?

939
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:27,292
I wonder what all the lines are for.

940
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:31,083
Hello.

941
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:32,500
I found the data.

942
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:36,458
The owner of the building
happens to have a company in Africa.

943
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,333
The company is a logging company
that has nothing to do with any electrics.

944
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:48,625
Is there any news?

945
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:51,346
<i>- The kids are saying they're hungry.</i>
- Yes.

946
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:53,684
<i>- Make it all sense to me.
- How are we supposed to live with no gas?</i>

947
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:56,042
<i>What the hell are you on?
I don't understand.</i>

948
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:58,768
- I mean, all of our kids are hungry.
- What are we supposed to do?

949
01:05:58,792 --> 01:06:00,542
What is going on here? What is this about?

950
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:01,875
What is wrong?

951
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,250
The ladies are arguing
about something in the hall.

952
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:08,375
I don't get it.

953
01:06:09,708 --> 01:06:12,292
We must have turned the gas off.
Now they cannot cook.

954
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:17,958
Now I think I get it.

955
01:06:19,125 --> 01:06:21,667
That's it! It's a blueprint for gas pipes.

956
01:06:27,292 --> 01:06:30,417
<i>Number seven from Team Ju Yuan
is getting ready to kick the ball</i>

957
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,500
<i>from 40 meters.</i>

958
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:33,583
<i>That player is a very good striker.</i>

959
01:06:33,667 --> 01:06:36,458
<i>Li Zhiyu, the number 10 player,
gets the pass and shoots.</i>

960
01:06:36,542 --> 01:06:38,667
<i>He shoots and scores with lightning speed.</i>

961
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:42,083
<i>He shoots, and it's in! The score is 2-2.</i>

962
01:06:42,167 --> 01:06:45,958
<i>Li Zhiyu is a dangerous opponent
for anyone. Amazing.</i>

963
01:06:46,042 --> 01:06:48,250
<i>- What are the chances of us losing?</i>
<i>- </i>Great.

964
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:49,792
This is getting more exciting.

965
01:06:52,292 --> 01:06:53,292
Stop.

966
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:54,500
- Stop.
- Look out.

967
01:06:54,833 --> 01:06:56,208
Hey, stop.

968
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:02,500
Are you OK?

969
01:07:02,625 --> 01:07:04,833
- Mr. Lee.
<i>- Emergency!</i>

970
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,560
<i>A car drove through the north gate
of the stadium and drove away.</i>

971
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:12,667
Tell the Terror Investigation Team!

972
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:15,542
- You and your subordinates also move.
- Yes, sir. We're on it.

973
01:07:15,625 --> 01:07:17,625
<i>The Blue Equus is heading towards Youngju.</i>

974
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:19,167
Those bastards.

975
01:07:22,792 --> 01:07:23,917
CAPTAIN JIANG CALLING

976
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:26,042
I think, I know where Guo Zhida is.

977
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,750
- What?
- Get the men over to the JCP building.

978
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,292
- OK.
<i>- Guo Zhida knew the police</i>

979
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:31,809
couldn't get the bomb off the pipe,

980
01:07:31,833 --> 01:07:34,250
which is the reason
for why he put the bomb under there

981
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:35,917
just as he did earlier.

982
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,333
Zhida was planning to use the gas pipes
to go to the JCP building.

983
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:42,792
<i>We are on our way to arrest Guo Zhida.</i>

984
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:45,792
<i>Zhida's planning to use a decoy
to distract us,</i>

985
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:48,667
<i>while he escapes to the stadium
using the gas pipes.</i>

986
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,167
<i>- Don't be fooled.
- Quiet!</i>

987
01:07:50,667 --> 01:07:53,000
<i>We have to take the bomb out,
so stay quiet.</i>

988
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:55,750
<i>Listen, turn your phone off now.</i>

989
01:07:58,875 --> 01:07:59,875
Damn it!

990
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,583
Why won't you listen to me?

991
01:08:20,125 --> 01:08:21,542
Dr. Yang, just stay here.

992
01:08:22,583 --> 01:08:25,333
If I don't come out in 15 minutes
then call the police.

993
01:08:26,125 --> 01:08:28,792
I want the truth just as much as you do.

994
01:08:29,125 --> 01:08:33,250
Well, there's no gas inspector
as attractive as Dr. Yang.

995
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:42,375
Hey, Jiang.

996
01:08:56,625 --> 01:08:57,625
Yes, sir.

997
01:08:58,125 --> 01:09:01,917
All the buildings have been cleared,
I am walking into the JCP building now.

998
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,292
How can I help you?

999
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:09,208
It's been reported that
there's a gas leak in an apartment.

1000
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:11,458
Sir, who are you?

1001
01:09:12,042 --> 01:09:13,708
I am from the gas corporation.

1002
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,917
The buildings around here have no gas,

1003
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,458
that's why I need to get in
and make an inspection.

1004
01:09:18,542 --> 01:09:20,250
We haven't been notified of that.

1005
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:21,333
You need to go.

1006
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,583
But I told you, I am checking the gas.

1007
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:24,750
Leave the building.

1008
01:10:48,917 --> 01:10:52,417
Don't worry. Go on. Get out of here.

1009
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:18,292
You must go. I am a cop.
Leave the building now.

1010
01:13:18,375 --> 01:13:19,375
Yes.

1011
01:14:43,792 --> 01:14:44,792
Get down.

1012
01:15:10,333 --> 01:15:13,375
<i>Right now we're in overtime.
The last three minutes.</i>

1013
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:14,792
<i>Who can save Ju Yuan?</i>

1014
01:15:15,042 --> 01:15:17,708
He told me to drive to the building
within ten minutes.

1015
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,000
He said that the bomb would explode.

1016
01:15:20,083 --> 01:15:22,208
- What are you doing here?
- I work here.

1017
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:24,292
It's the headquarters of the gambling mob.

1018
01:15:24,667 --> 01:15:25,750
Please help me.

1019
01:15:37,792 --> 01:15:39,125
The police are everywhere.

1020
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:40,500
What?

1021
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:42,250
Damn.

1022
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:46,042
<i>Li Zhiyu brings the ball inside.
The defenders run past. He's in.</i>

1023
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:54,625
<i>He takes the shot!</i>

1024
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,500
<i>Goal! Just in the nick of time he scored.</i>

1025
01:16:19,833 --> 01:16:22,917
<i>This game will forever be
in the history books.</i>

1026
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,167
KOREA 23 CHINA

1027
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:39,208
<i>Ju Yuan wins the game 3-2</i>

1028
01:16:39,292 --> 01:16:40,625
IT'S TIME FOR US TO WIN

1029
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:42,125
<i>They beat Goyang Shinsung.</i>

1030
01:16:42,208 --> 01:16:46,500
<i>Ju Yuan outscored Shinsung
and they become the Asia Cup champions.</i>

1031
01:17:12,625 --> 01:17:15,292
The explosion has started
from the basement of the building.

1032
01:17:15,625 --> 01:17:17,333
I think Captain Jiang is inside.

1033
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:19,625
Let's go in now.

1034
01:17:20,333 --> 01:17:23,083
All right, everyone check inside
the building carefully.

1035
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,833
If anyone tries to resist...

1036
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:26,500
then shoot them.

1037
01:17:26,542 --> 01:17:28,083
- I understand.
- I understand.

1038
01:17:28,208 --> 01:17:29,768
<i>The third floor of the basement
has exploded.</i>

1039
01:17:29,792 --> 01:17:32,208
<i>Everyone move upstairs
to the fourth floor of the building.</i>

1040
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:43,542
Sorry, you can't enter.

1041
01:17:55,083 --> 01:17:58,833
<i>We are finding resistance in the building.
They're heavily armed.</i>

1042
01:17:59,917 --> 01:18:01,917
<i>It's getting crazy in here. Be careful.</i>

1043
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,583
<i>All right, watch yourselves.</i>

1044
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:13,750
<i>Repeating. We are finding resistance.
They're heavily armed.</i>

1045
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:23,542
<i>Be careful now, there's lots of them.</i>

1046
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,458
<i>Attention, everyone, be careful.</i>

1047
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:38,375
Help me.

1048
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:49,542
<i>They're many in there,
but we will beat them.</i>

1049
01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:16,625
79 DEO 2682

1050
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:40,958
Over here.

1051
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:45,750
Captain, are you OK?

1052
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:49,573
- Are you OK, sir?
- Are you OK?

1053
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:53,250
We'll tell the team.

1054
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:54,833
I saw Guo Zhida,

1055
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:56,333
dressed like a cop.

1056
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,542
You have to find him, he's getting away.

1057
01:19:59,292 --> 01:20:00,958
- Halt! Pull over!
- Yeah, I got him.

1058
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:37,958
Turn it off. Hands up.

1059
01:20:40,292 --> 01:20:41,583
You'll never shoot.

1060
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:42,875
Wanna make a bet?

1061
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:45,250
OK, let's bet...

1062
01:20:45,917 --> 01:20:47,125
on your losing.

1063
01:20:47,208 --> 01:20:48,625
The bomb's wired to my heart.

1064
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:51,292
It will explode
as soon as it stops beating.

1065
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:55,500
You think I am surprised?

1066
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:58,500
I've always wanted to know
what shooting a gun feels like.

1067
01:20:59,417 --> 01:21:00,417
Captain.

1068
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:13,792
Dr. Yang...

1069
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,083
Yang Xi.

1070
01:21:32,917 --> 01:21:34,042
Hey, Captain.

1071
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:35,208
Captain.

1072
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,958
The suspect has Dr. Yang
on a bus right now.

1073
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:40,042
Number 2682.

1074
01:21:40,292 --> 01:21:41,417
- Got it, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1075
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:44,875
Red bus 2682, check the location.

1076
01:21:47,625 --> 01:21:50,833
Dr. Yang, do you think
you can guess my next plan?

1077
01:21:50,917 --> 01:21:53,583
No, I can't,
because you don't have a hand to play.

1078
01:21:53,667 --> 01:21:56,458
As soon I got on the bus,
all your plans has turned into failure.

1079
01:21:57,708 --> 01:21:58,833
You have lost.

1080
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:02,792
Right now the suspect
is fleeing in a red bus,

1081
01:22:02,875 --> 01:22:04,417
which is heading for Sangam-dong.

1082
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:07,625
Get all the patrol cars
to follow that bus right away.

1083
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,458
Chase after that bus.

1084
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:11,542
There.

1085
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:13,417
We see the bus.

1086
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:15,901
Everyone stay on that vehicle
as it heads towards the bridge.

1087
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:21,792
<i>The hostage is inside the bus.</i>

1088
01:22:22,292 --> 01:22:24,500
<i>Don't shoot him
until the situation is cleared.</i>

1089
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,583
<i>The most important thing is her safety.</i>

1090
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,792
No, don't shoot.

1091
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,500
Surrender. You have nowhere to go.

1092
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,375
What's the reason?

1093
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:07,750
Today your brother came after me.

1094
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:10,458
I said that you needed to be
in a hospital,

1095
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,292
and he told me no.

1096
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,125
In his words...

1097
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:18,167
he said that your home is
where you had your accident.

1098
01:26:25,083 --> 01:26:27,708
You tried all the time to make up a story.

1099
01:26:27,917 --> 01:26:29,875
But the truth is, he was by your side...

1100
01:26:30,542 --> 01:26:31,667
the whole time.

1101
01:26:32,375 --> 01:26:33,875
Your brother's waiting.

1102
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:38,125
Oh, my brother!

1103
01:26:38,958 --> 01:26:41,125
Who I have is now enough.

1104
01:26:41,958 --> 01:26:43,750
Keep all your possessions.

1105
01:26:55,333 --> 01:26:56,458
Get out now.

1106
01:27:03,708 --> 01:27:04,917
Let's both go.

1107
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:08,083
It's really the best decision
you can make for your brother.

1108
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:38,875
<i>The investigation unit is here.
We will find all the evidence.</i>

1109
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:12,833
Make sure it's all wrapped up.

1110
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,625
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1111
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:23,583
Are you OK?

1112
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,333
You did a great job.
Now, go and get some rest.

1113
01:29:29,042 --> 01:29:32,292
The DNA of the body
still needs to be examined.

1114
01:29:36,958 --> 01:29:38,458
Hey, come here, An.

1115
01:29:38,542 --> 01:29:39,833
Of course, sir.

1116
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,917
"Oh, my brother!

1117
01:29:42,292 --> 01:29:44,333
All that I have is now enough.

1118
01:29:44,750 --> 01:29:46,333
Keep all your possessions."

1119
01:29:46,417 --> 01:29:47,417
What does that mean?

1120
01:29:48,375 --> 01:29:49,792
Do you know what that means?

1121
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:51,208
"Oh, my brother!

1122
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:53,208
Mine is more than enough.

1123
01:29:53,958 --> 01:29:56,833
- You may keep your possessions."
- Yes, that's it.

1124
01:30:16,625 --> 01:30:19,333
An, could you take Dr. Yang
and escort her home?

1125
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:20,750
Certainly, sir.

1126
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:32,917
I am sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

1127
01:30:33,792 --> 01:30:36,583
That's not right. The Korean Government
will compensate you, Doctor

1128
01:30:37,875 --> 01:30:39,375
Then I must stay in Korea.

1129
01:30:40,292 --> 01:30:41,792
Yes, of course.

1130
01:30:42,167 --> 01:30:44,167
You still have a reporting to do.

1131
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:46,000
So, you can't leave Korea.

1132
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:48,542
And I will find you.

1133
01:30:56,458 --> 01:30:57,917
I'll be sure to find you.

1134
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:02,208
Hey, Captain.

1135
01:32:02,667 --> 01:32:04,083
The reports have just come in.

1136
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:07,167
Guess what, the dead body
and Guo Zhida's DNA matched.

1137
01:32:07,708 --> 01:32:09,125
Guo Zhida is dead, sir.

1138
01:32:09,458 --> 01:32:11,018
I thought that you wanted to know, sir.

1139
01:32:13,042 --> 01:32:15,958
Please tell Guo Zhihua
why his brother committed suicide.

1140
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:17,875
Yes, sir.

1141
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:21,292
When did Guo Zhihua go home?

1142
01:32:22,333 --> 01:32:24,750
Commissioner Kim said
we should talk to the suspect

1143
01:32:24,833 --> 01:32:26,000
because we might need him.

1144
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,500
So, Zhihua was told to stay.

1145
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:30,625
Then who's guarding him?

1146
01:32:31,667 --> 01:32:33,708
Maybe the NIS is guarding him.

1147
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:35,042
Maybe, you say?

1148
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:37,417
Hurry up and find out now.

1149
01:32:38,292 --> 01:32:39,500
Yes, on it, sir.

1150
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:36,000
Guo ZhiDa

1151
01:33:42,458 --> 01:33:44,625
<i>This was written in a strange way.</i>

1152
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:46,958
<i>Write the lower case first
and then the capitals.</i>

1153
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,875
<i>These habits are impossible to break.</i>

1154
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:51,708
<i>It's about forensics.</i>

1155
01:33:53,042 --> 01:33:56,625
<i>You probably don't even know
how amazing my brother is.</i>

1156
01:33:56,750 --> 01:33:58,542
<i>In America,
he worked part time at Stark's.</i>

1157
01:33:58,625 --> 01:34:00,333
<i>Stark? Do you know it?</i>

1158
01:34:00,958 --> 01:34:04,292
<i>They manufacture weapons
and they're in America.</i>

1159
01:34:04,958 --> 01:34:08,125
This was upgraded in America.
It's heavier, right?

1160
01:34:08,833 --> 01:34:11,000
<i>Dr. Yang, you can't even imagine.</i>

1161
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:13,292
<i>My brother won the gold for swimming.</i>

1162
01:34:26,167 --> 01:34:27,167
What are you looking at?

1163
01:35:04,792 --> 01:35:07,667
Call the SWAT team
and tell them to go to Guo Zhihua's house.

1164
01:35:08,042 --> 01:35:10,250
Guo Zhihua is really just a disguise.

1165
01:35:35,417 --> 01:35:36,750
Mr. Guo, is something wrong?

1166
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,333
Sorry to bother you so suddenly but...

1167
01:35:40,458 --> 01:35:42,250
I just heard from the police.

1168
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:45,500
My brother...

1169
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,167
committed suicide before he was captured.

1170
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:53,458
I am here to obtain
my brother's medical records from you.

1171
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:57,458
Must be urgent.

1172
01:35:58,875 --> 01:36:00,042
But I was supposed to...

1173
01:36:03,083 --> 01:36:04,083
OK.

1174
01:36:05,042 --> 01:36:06,042
Hold on a sec.

1175
01:36:06,375 --> 01:36:08,208
- I'll go and look.
- Thank you for that.

1176
01:37:01,333 --> 01:37:02,333
Dr. Yang.

1177
01:37:05,083 --> 01:37:06,083
Dr. Yang.

1178
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:07,333
Is something wrong?

1179
01:37:08,042 --> 01:37:09,083
Calm down, don't rush.

1180
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:13,208
What's it called? Give me your phone.

1181
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,833
<i>Captain, we've searched Guo's home.</i>

1182
01:37:59,167 --> 01:38:00,958
<i>That bastard's not at home.</i>

1183
01:38:30,833 --> 01:38:33,375
If you take one more step,
I'll throw it in the water.

1184
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:38,167
You're afraid that it will get wet,
that's why you put this in my pocket.

1185
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:42,708
<i>You probably didn't expect me
to be on the bus.</i>

1186
01:38:42,958 --> 01:38:45,375
That's why you are acting this way.
Is that right?

1187
01:38:49,375 --> 01:38:50,375
Dr. Yang.

1188
01:38:50,875 --> 01:38:52,875
Do you have to behave like this right now.

1189
01:38:53,667 --> 01:38:57,125
I was going to live peacefully,
live quietly with the USB.

1190
01:38:57,625 --> 01:39:02,500
The police examined the DNA and then they
notified me that it was my dead brother.

1191
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,792
The suspect is dead
and the police took care of the situation.

1192
01:39:06,958 --> 01:39:09,167
The bomb was taking care of...
Oh, yes.

1193
01:39:09,708 --> 01:39:12,208
The illegal gamblers failed
in their nasty business.

1194
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:17,667
I just wanted the truth.

1195
01:39:18,042 --> 01:39:19,375
What the hell is in this thing?

1196
01:39:23,292 --> 01:39:24,292
A black key.

1197
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:27,667
<i>The gambling group transfers
their money in files with the USB.</i>

1198
01:39:29,042 --> 01:39:31,500
<i>When I was in America,
I learned how they worked.</i>

1199
01:39:31,708 --> 01:39:33,029
<i>I know how they distribute money.</i>

1200
01:39:33,875 --> 01:39:35,750
- Black key is ready.
- Yes, sir.

1201
01:39:35,833 --> 01:39:38,000
My brother told me about it.

1202
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:41,625
He said that one day,
he would pay me all the money.

1203
01:39:42,167 --> 01:39:45,083
I knew the time had come
when the gambling group came to me.

1204
01:39:45,833 --> 01:39:47,417
And then it changed.

1205
01:39:49,458 --> 01:39:50,792
<i>Tell me who I met.</i>

1206
01:39:51,458 --> 01:39:53,208
<i>Are you the oldest or the youngest?</i>

1207
01:39:53,875 --> 01:39:55,792
<i>Will you tell me?</i>

1208
01:39:57,208 --> 01:39:58,750
<i>Except for the first time.</i>

1209
01:39:59,292 --> 01:40:01,750
<i>The person you met has always been me.</i>

1210
01:40:09,167 --> 01:40:11,542
So, you killed your brother for money?

1211
01:40:12,958 --> 01:40:15,625
My brother was a loser his entire life.

1212
01:40:15,875 --> 01:40:19,125
He has done only one thing
and that was his death.

1213
01:40:19,958 --> 01:40:23,833
Now, his name will be on the list
of most wanted Korean criminals.

1214
01:40:23,917 --> 01:40:27,458
Guo Zhida has surpassed his confidence
and his brother surpassed that

1215
01:40:27,542 --> 01:40:28,542
with all his money.

1216
01:40:30,458 --> 01:40:31,542
"Oh, brother!

1217
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:33,875
Mine is now enough.

1218
01:40:34,333 --> 01:40:37,875
You can keep all of your possessions."

1219
01:40:40,375 --> 01:40:41,792
Now, I understand.

1220
01:40:42,083 --> 01:40:44,292
Your brother was not the person
who was crazy,

1221
01:40:44,625 --> 01:40:45,625
it was you.

1222
01:40:45,875 --> 01:40:46,958
Dr. Yang.

1223
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:49,875
You really like to pose,
but I'll take that.

1224
01:40:51,792 --> 01:40:53,292
I am not as smart as you.

1225
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:56,270
But since I am here, you can't take...

1226
01:40:57,542 --> 01:40:58,833
anything away from me.

1227
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,125
Do you still think you're a winner?

1228
01:41:07,833 --> 01:41:10,375
Because I happen to know
exactly what you are.

1229
01:41:10,458 --> 01:41:13,417
You are actually nothing,
but a psychotic loser.

1230
01:41:48,875 --> 01:41:50,625
I told you I would come get you.

1231
01:41:55,833 --> 01:41:58,417
What did you say to the bastard
to make him come over?

1232
01:42:00,458 --> 01:42:03,292
This is a conversation
between doctor and patient.

1233
01:42:03,375 --> 01:42:05,167
Doctors should respect their secrets.

1234
01:42:07,167 --> 01:42:09,292
And did you really throw away the USB?

1235
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:12,708
Maybe.

1236
01:42:37,167 --> 01:42:40,958
Yes, I am on the way to the hospital
on Tehran Street with Dr. Yang.

1237
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:44,250
The USB of the illegal gambling group
is safe with me.
