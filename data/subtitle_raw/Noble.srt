You should have been
in school today, Christina,

19
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,002
and every other day.

20
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:02,303
You'll never catch me,
Inspector Clark.

21
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:04,772
That's what they all say.
I'll catch you, all right,

22
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:07,674
and I'll tell the judge to
send you off to Cuan Mhuire,

23
00:02:07,676 --> 00:02:10,176
the old nuns will teach you
manners there.

24
00:02:10,178 --> 00:02:12,679
In your dreams, mister.

25
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,316
There we go.

26
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:21,287
One, two, yeah.

27
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:32,798
Well? I won a singing
competition, Dad.

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,233
I got a voucher for my dress.

29
00:02:34,235 --> 00:02:35,667
You are going to be a big star.

30
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,603
Do you promise me? Of course I do.
You have a great talent.

31
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:40,171
And you didn't
lick it off the stones.

32
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:42,973
Here, did I ever tell yous
about the time,

33
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:46,010
I won the All Ireland boxing?

34
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:46,877
Daddy was on the ropes.

35
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,047
Yeah, Dad.
Hilda Brannigan had a weakness,

36
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:53,317
so I punched him hard
in the ribs.

37
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,818
And he looks at me,

38
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,322
he starts to stagger sideways,

39
00:02:58,324 --> 00:03:01,223
Then the coup de grace, boom...

40
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:03,159
and he goes down,

41
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:04,193
like a bleeding stone.

42
00:03:04,195 --> 00:03:07,096
And that made you champion,
did it, Dad?

43
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:08,364
It did. Come on, get up.

44
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:10,700
Could have gone to America
myself after that.

45
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:12,368
All the promoters
were interested.

46
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,735
Why didn't you go, Dad?

47
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:16,638
Because I met your ma,
and that was the end of me.

48
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,873
Come on you.

49
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:22,811
If we don't get home,
she'll think we did a bunk.

50
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,322
Come on, Christina.

51
00:03:35,324 --> 00:03:38,859
If we don't go now,
they'll be sold out.

52
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:44,864
Be careful there, Christina.

53
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:47,767
Don't worry about me,
Mrs. Doyle.

54
00:03:52,705 --> 00:03:54,873
Aw, good girl.

55
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:05,716
Thanks, love.

56
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:07,152
I don't know
what happened to me there.

57
00:04:07,154 --> 00:04:12,857
It must have been the excitement
seeing her all grown up.

I'm not hungry, Mum.

67
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:07,106
An hour ago you said
you could eat a horse.

68
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,008
That was an hour ago.

69
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,311
Is it horse stew
we're having, Mum?

70
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,828

00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:03,848
Oh, will you get the children
after school, Mrs. Kelly?

84
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,950
And look out
to the little ones for the day.

85
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:08,553
I will, love,
don't you be worrying.

86
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:12,189
That's it. That's it.

87
00:07:12,191 --> 00:07:14,057
Excuse me now.

00:07:15,293 --> 00:07:17,427
<i>And he looks like

89
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:36,344
Mum.

90
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:40,081
Look, I wore me dress for you.

91
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:58,064
I'm sorry I've been asking
too many things.

92
00:07:58,066 --> 00:08:02,335
You don't have to make me like
Dorset, if you don't want to.

93
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:05,271
I don't have to go to America.

94
00:08:05,273 --> 00:08:06,539
I'll stay here

95
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:09,976
so long as you don't let me
lovely mum die.

96
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:12,510
Sure you won't, God?

97
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,331
It's time for you to go
on home now, Christina.

98
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,599
I don't want to go home.

99
00:08:36,601 --> 00:08:37,902
That's as may be,

100
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:39,602
but your daddy's
waiting on you.

101
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:41,437
God told me to stay here.

102
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,940
He says
he's going to cure my mum,

103
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:44,574
if I stay here.

104
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:47,243
That's enough nonsense.

105
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:48,944
God can't cure everyone.

106
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:53,149
You're expected home.

107
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,268
Glasses off.

108
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:53,371
You don't need to be anxious.

109
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:56,540
It just takes a long time
to get through immigration.

110
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:59,376
I'm okay, don't worry about me.

111
00:09:59,578 --> 00:10:01,979
You've been here
before obviously.

112
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:03,145
Twelve times.

113
00:10:03,147 --> 00:10:04,414
You must like it.

114
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,248
Oh, I love it.

115
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,049
The people are fantastic.

116
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:10,120
The countryside,
the beach, the food.

117
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:11,721
What's not to like?

118
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:13,422
The queues.

119
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:15,324
All right, the queues.

120
00:10:15,326 --> 00:10:16,492
The music.

121
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:19,561
Well, it's not Mozart,
but it's atmospheric.

122
00:10:19,563 --> 00:10:23,732
The scary London, nearly
bouncing off the rooftops.

123
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:24,632
Also atmospheric.

124
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:27,569
Are you always
such a glass half empty type?

125
00:10:27,571 --> 00:10:30,138
I'm only pulling your leg.

126
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:32,640
So what brings you here?

127
00:10:32,642 --> 00:10:37,312
I don't know. If I told
you, I'd have to kill you.

128
00:11:15,715 --> 00:11:16,580
Thank you.

129
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:18,282
Thank you, madam.

130
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:23,788
That's great.

131
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:27,624
Hello.

132
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:29,159
Hello.

133
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:37,767
Excuse me?

134
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:40,103
My name is Christina Noble.

135
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:42,337
You're expecting me I hope.

136
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:44,440
We expect all our guests.

137
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:47,376
I suppose you do.
And what's your name?

138
00:11:47,378 --> 00:11:50,512
My name is Mr. Reception Desk.

139
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:52,747
That's a nice name.

140
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:54,216
Passport.

141
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:55,817
Passport.

142
00:11:59,455 --> 00:12:00,755
You're English.

143
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:02,623
Irish, big difference.

144
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:05,726
Oh, yes, big difference.

145
00:12:05,728 --> 00:12:06,793
Big difference.

146
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:09,796
How long you staying here
at the Cornett Hotel?

147
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:12,599
Well, as long as it takes
to make you smile,

148
00:12:12,601 --> 00:12:15,234
Mr. Reception Desk.

149
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:21,140
Room 204.

150
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:47,164
Jesus.

151
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:57,474
Let me go please.

152
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,487
There you go.

153
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:32,473
It's hot dog?

154
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:33,806
No dog sorry.

155
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:35,209
It's not dog?

156
00:13:35,211 --> 00:13:36,543
Not dog sorry.

157
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,845
I don't want dog. Yes, not dog.

158
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:42,615
Okay, I'll have two not dogs.

159
00:13:42,617 --> 00:13:44,717
Okay, two not dogs.

160
00:13:44,719 --> 00:13:46,419
Thank you.

161
00:13:51,724 --> 00:13:53,725
Do you like to smoke, lady?

162
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:54,526
I gave them up.

163
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:57,896
It's never too late
to start again.

164
00:13:57,898 --> 00:13:59,932
No, thank you.

165
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:01,732
You are on your own?

166
00:14:01,734 --> 00:14:03,367
Yes, on my own.

167
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:04,235
No husband?

168
00:14:04,237 --> 00:14:05,537
It's complicated.

169
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,705
What is your name?

170
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,474
My name is Meiyang.

171
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:13,277
Meiyang, Christina.

172
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,246
The truth is, Christina,

173
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:21,218
sometimes love last same,
same time as a cigarette.

174
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,953
Don't I know it?

175
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,000

00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:30,126
Yummy.

184
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:31,781
Dad.

185
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,117
Yeah.

186
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,186
What did we do wrong?

187
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:39,490
It'll be for the best.

188
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:40,523

Did you ever really
love us, Dad?

191
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:51,835
It has been reported
by Mr. Clark,

192
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:54,169
the school's
attendance inspector,

193
00:18:54,171 --> 00:18:57,739
that this has been
a particularly tiresome case

194
00:18:57,741 --> 00:19:00,776
of truancy
and parental neglect.

195
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:04,746
His recommendation
is that the children be sent

196
00:19:04,748 --> 00:19:06,881
to separate institutions

197
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:12,619
for their own educational
benefits and welfare.

198
00:19:14,088 --> 00:19:15,689
Daddy!

199
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:17,091
Daddy!

200
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:22,229
Hold it down now.

201
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:24,030
Down the stairs.

202
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,735

203
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,586

Well, there is punctuality
for you, Sister Sumta.

205
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:54,759
4 o'clock the man said,
and 4 o'clock it is.

206
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:55,692
What way did you come?

207
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,128
The Cong Road, Mother Superior.
And you were right.

208
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,230
They've had terrible floods
in Maam Cross.

209
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,265
Noah had nothing
on the west of Ireland,

210
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,001
isn't that the truth of us?

211
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:09,038
Take the child, Sister Sumta.

212
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:37,331
Don't worry about those
frightsy bitches of nuns.

00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,959
Well, you're a tonic,
Mr. Brendan.

226
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:33,761
You really are.

227
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:38,131
Now, Christina, I hope you
said thank you to Mr. Brendan

228
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:39,132
for returning you safely

229
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:42,168
from your little farlay
into the great beyond.

230
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,903
Thank you again, Mr. Brendan.

231
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:45,805
He tells me
that you have a great talent.

232
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:49,742
Want to be nurtured carefully
at this tender age mind.

233
00:23:49,744 --> 00:23:51,044
What with the potential
to blossom

234
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:55,114
into a wonderful national,
even international career.

235
00:23:55,116 --> 00:23:58,050
Where did you say you had
your contacts, Mr. Brendan?

236
00:23:58,052 --> 00:24:00,952
The Royal Albert Hall
in London,

237
00:24:00,954 --> 00:24:03,122
Radio City in New York.

238
00:24:03,124 --> 00:24:04,155
The Conservatoire in Paris.

239
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:07,959
Oh, yes, we mustn't forget
the Conservatoire.

240
00:24:07,961 --> 00:24:10,193
There's only one problem.

241
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:12,963
What's that, Mother Superior?

242
00:24:12,965 --> 00:24:14,365
That... That is...

243
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:18,535
That is that your name
isn't Doris Day, is it?

244
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:21,838
<i>Do you actually
love those people?</i>

245
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,976
<i>Because I won't be a friend
for much longer if you do.</i>

246
00:24:25,978 --> 00:24:27,844
<i>I know I should forgive them</i>

247
00:24:27,846 --> 00:24:29,479
<i>but I'm not going to.</i>

248
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:30,846
<i>I'm going to stand up to them.</i>

249
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:33,549
<i>An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth,</i>

250
00:24:33,551 --> 00:24:34,917
<i>a slap for a slap.</i>

251
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,318
<i>Isn't that what you said</i>

252
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,087
<i>about something
that got in your way?</i>

253
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:41,090
<i>Don't worry, I wasn't
really gonna hit them.</i>

254
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:44,326
<i>It's just that you know
what's going on in my head.</i>

255
00:24:44,328 --> 00:24:47,162
<i>I know I've taken
a few bad knocks.</i>

256
00:24:47,164 --> 00:24:48,997
<i>I'm not saying
that was your fault.</i>

257
00:24:48,998 --> 00:24:51,900
<i>Because I know you've got
a much better future</i>

258
00:24:51,902 --> 00:24:53,834
<i>in store for me.</i>

259
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,107
Hey, Irish,
you left your book behind.

260
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:02,142
I'll pick it up later.

261
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:06,212
Okay, in you go.

262
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,948
Excuse me...

263
00:25:15,022 --> 00:25:16,155
Floor moving.

264
00:25:16,157 --> 00:25:19,225
Yeah, going up in the world.

265
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:26,064
That's lovely, thank you.

266
00:25:50,988 --> 00:25:52,889
It's great, Meiyang.

267
00:26:10,239 --> 00:26:12,507
Okay, out we go.

268
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,412
<i>Not allowed to bring
these bui doi children</i>

269
00:26:18,414 --> 00:26:20,347
into the hotel. Why not?

270
00:26:20,349 --> 00:26:23,584
Do you not like Vietnamese
people staying here?

271
00:26:24,953 --> 00:26:26,319
Thank you.

272
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:12,462
<i>Xin chao.</i>

273
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,399
<i>Xin chao.</i>

274
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:28,577
Is that another glass
half empty I see?

275
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:29,611
Hello again.

276
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:31,947
Can I buy you a refill?

277
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:33,548
Sure, why not.

278
00:27:40,323 --> 00:27:42,056
There's a place called Can Tho,

279
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:45,159
which is like a sort of Venice
in Mekong Delta.

280
00:27:45,161 --> 00:27:48,462
It's quite a site.
You should go there.

281
00:27:48,464 --> 00:27:49,530
To Venice?

282
00:27:49,532 --> 00:27:50,431
No, to Can Tho.

283
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:54,301
It's only about a day's drive.
Don't worry, I'm going.

284
00:27:54,303 --> 00:27:55,736
I'm going to see
all of Vietnam.

285
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:58,438
Well, do it before the place
gets developed to death.

286
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,341
It was once the Americans
with their trade embargo,

287
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:04,310
whoosh, same, same
as everywhere else.

288
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:07,245
Is that what you're here for,
David, whoosh?

289
00:28:07,247 --> 00:28:09,247
I'm a businessman, Christina.

290
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:12,017
We all have to take
what we can get.

291
00:28:12,019 --> 00:28:13,353
Do we?

292
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:16,722
I think we do.

293
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:33,371
Stand back now, kids.

294
00:28:33,373 --> 00:28:35,439
Very, very hot, hot.

295
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:42,045
Vietnamese fish and chips.

296
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:44,214
Do you want salt and vinegar
on those?

297
00:29:04,066 --> 00:29:05,099
Whoa.

298
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:07,068
Okay, let's go.

299
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:09,771
Oh, it's perfect.

300
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:12,039
Let's get places.

301
00:29:19,514 --> 00:29:21,681
You are a tourist, Tina?

302
00:29:21,683 --> 00:29:23,250
No, not a tourist.

303
00:29:23,252 --> 00:29:24,084
What do you do?

304
00:29:24,085 --> 00:29:27,120
I'm just a mother, mama.

305
00:29:27,122 --> 00:29:28,288
Mama Tina?

306
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,523
Yes, Mama Tina.

307
00:29:30,525 --> 00:29:32,792
Mama Tina, Lam.

308
00:29:32,794 --> 00:29:35,760
Hello, Lam,
it's good to meet you.

309
00:29:35,762 --> 00:29:37,729
Where is your family?

310
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:40,198
Don't know. Where are yours?

311
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,668
Well, my children
are in London.

312
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,568
They are grown up now.

313
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:45,503
They don't need
Mama Tina anymore?

314
00:29:45,505 --> 00:29:48,572
No, only
when they get into trouble.

315
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:50,507
Do you have
brothers and sisters?

316
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:52,677
<i>Two brothers, are bui doi also,</i>

317
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,478
but I don't know
where they are.

318
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,614
<i>What does it mean this bui doi?</i>

319
00:29:57,616 --> 00:30:00,217
It means "dust of life."

320
00:30:00,218 --> 00:30:01,784
The dust beneath your soles.

321
00:30:01,786 --> 00:30:06,423
<i>Ah, I was bui doi also
when I was young.</i>

322
00:30:06,425 --> 00:30:07,657
No.

323
00:30:07,659 --> 00:30:08,524
Yes.

324
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:11,394
Oh, my God!

325
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:18,600
What the hell do you think
you are doing?

326
00:30:18,602 --> 00:30:20,235
They are not allowed
in my shop!

327
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:22,370
Those children are with me,
they are my guests.

328
00:30:22,372 --> 00:30:26,308
But your guests
will ruin my business.

329
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,647
Tell me, Mrs. Noble,

330
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:36,584
do you know of any city
in the world

331
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,520
where people
want to see the streets

332
00:30:39,522 --> 00:30:42,790
ruled by vagrant children?

333
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:44,257
No, inspector.

334
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,458
So what makes you,

335
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,161
a woman
newly arrived from Europe,

336
00:30:48,163 --> 00:30:51,131
think that we should
give up our city

337
00:30:51,133 --> 00:30:52,298
<i>to this bui doi?</i>

338
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,433
I don't.

339
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,868
But when I was young
I was also homeless,

340
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,404
without the protection
of parents.

341
00:30:58,406 --> 00:31:03,208
An Irish gutter is the same
as a Vietnamese gutter.

342
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,644
I know how hard it is.

343
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:06,677
Really?

344
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:08,646
You must have been
a good beggar.

345
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:11,550
I've never begged for anything
in my life, inspector.

346
00:31:11,552 --> 00:31:13,484
<i>I always worked
when I was bui doi.</i>

347
00:31:13,486 --> 00:31:16,755
But at least I was allowed
to spend my money in a chipper

348
00:31:16,757 --> 00:31:19,423
or an ice cream shop
without being thrown out.

349
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:22,927
Mrs. Noble, you are here
on a tourist visa.

350
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:26,863
And you behave
as if you have a work permit.

351
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:28,899
If I find
that you have violated

352
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:31,801
the terms of your visa
once more

353
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:36,806
you could be deported
and barred from Vietnam.

00:32:21,683 --> 00:32:22,782
Well, I'm good.

368
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,616
Do you mean that?

369
00:32:23,618 --> 00:32:26,619
They made me a farmer up the
brewery, took the pledge,

370
00:32:26,621 --> 00:32:29,921
haven't had a drink
in a year and a half.

371
00:32:30,756 --> 00:32:32,357
Look at you,

372
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:34,659
beautiful young woman.

373
00:32:35,861 --> 00:32:37,696
Don't worry, Christina.

374
00:32:37,698 --> 00:32:39,664
Really?

375
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,800
Hungry?

376
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:44,502
Come on, I'll treat you
to fish and chips.

377
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:48,840
The nuns gave me £5
to start me out in the world.

378
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:52,742
I'm gonna get a job

379
00:32:52,744 --> 00:32:54,410
save up for singing lessons.

380
00:32:54,412 --> 00:32:56,246
Then I might be able
to make a goal of it,

381
00:32:56,248 --> 00:32:57,314
you know, professionally.

382
00:32:57,316 --> 00:32:59,283
Didn't I always say
that was your destiny.

383
00:32:59,285 --> 00:33:01,651
Be fair to you, Dad, it is.

384
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:02,418
Oh, now

385
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,554
there's a load of new houses
going up in Cromet.

386
00:33:04,556 --> 00:33:07,457
I'll get our name
down on the corporation list.

387
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:10,493
We'll get your brothers
and sisters back,

388
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:11,994
be a family again.

389
00:33:11,996 --> 00:33:13,795
What do you think?

390
00:33:15,465 --> 00:33:17,532
Here. Here's the five
I owe you.

391
00:33:17,534 --> 00:33:20,001
I just want to get some fags.

392
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:22,604
I've not any money.

393
00:33:24,273 --> 00:33:27,942
A pint of bottle lemonade, Dad, will you?
Of course.

394
00:33:27,944 --> 00:33:29,010
Back in a jiffy.

395
00:33:29,012 --> 00:33:33,514
Dad, did Mum
ever get a gravestone?

396
00:33:34,415 --> 00:33:36,049
Let's take care
of the living first,

397
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:38,985
and then, you know...

398
00:33:42,723 --> 00:33:45,425
Would you like
some more water at the table?

399
00:33:45,427 --> 00:33:46,726
Please.

400
00:33:56,536 --> 00:33:58,803
Hey, you can pay at the till.

401
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:00,939
We close at 6.

402
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,512
Hey, come back here you!

403
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:11,615
Stop there, will you?

404
00:34:52,854 --> 00:34:54,421
<i>What are you crying for?</i>

405
00:34:54,423 --> 00:34:57,091
<i>I'm the one
who should be bawling.</i>

406
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:13,473
I said to him, "If you ask me
up to dance one more time",

407
00:35:13,475 --> 00:35:14,973
I'll give you a box
in the nose."

408
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:16,709
You didn't. I said,

409
00:35:16,711 --> 00:35:19,846
"Did no one never teach you
to take no for an answer?"

410
00:35:19,848 --> 00:35:23,582
Well, he looked to me
like a dodo.

411
00:35:23,584 --> 00:35:24,616
"No."

412
00:35:24,618 --> 00:35:25,684
Ah, the poor fella.

413
00:35:25,686 --> 00:35:26,651
Poor fella me, aye.

414
00:35:26,653 --> 00:35:27,919
He was back 10 minutes later.

415
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:30,389
"Joan, would you ever
give us a dance

416
00:35:30,391 --> 00:35:31,857
before they stop the music?"

417
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:32,657
What did you do?

418
00:35:32,659 --> 00:35:34,525
I threw him a punch of course.

419
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:35,527
You didn't.

420
00:35:35,528 --> 00:35:36,527
I did, he ducked.

421
00:35:36,529 --> 00:35:38,496
Hit his friend,
scruffy little redhead.

422
00:35:38,498 --> 00:35:41,765
I had to dance with him
then to make up for it.

423
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:42,733
I kissed him and all.

424
00:35:42,735 --> 00:35:45,402
Redheads is good kissers.

425
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:47,104
More iron in their blood
or something,

426
00:35:47,106 --> 00:35:49,473
but they do taste a bit rusty.

427
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:52,041
I'll get you one
to have a go-off.

428
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:16,063
You've done well, girl.

429
00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:17,732
Keep it up now.

430
00:36:17,734 --> 00:36:20,735
Don't let a good beginning
slip away from you,

431
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:21,669
like so many others.

432
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:25,672
Thank you, Mr. O'Reilly,
I won't.

433
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:38,984
That little redheaded fella
must have been contagious.

434
00:36:38,986 --> 00:36:41,787
He would have given me the flu.

435
00:36:42,656 --> 00:36:45,089
Where'd you live, Shoes?

436
00:36:45,091 --> 00:36:46,792
Me?

437
00:36:47,661 --> 00:36:50,228
Um, down at black pits?

438
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,599
You can walk home with us so.

439
00:36:57,102 --> 00:36:58,136
That's my place.

440
00:36:58,138 --> 00:36:59,838
I'll see yous all tomorrow.

441
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,675
We'll wait,
see you get in safely.

442
00:37:03,677 --> 00:37:05,075
Okay.

443
00:37:21,124 --> 00:37:22,625
Shite, I was wrong.

444
00:37:22,627 --> 00:37:24,759
She's not a tanker. Mm-hmm.

445
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:26,095
Come on.

446
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,599
♪ Sweet dreams
till sunbeams find you ♪

447
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:36,204

all worries behind you ♪

450
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,914
Lovely to meet you.

451
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:48,716
Goodbye now.

452
00:37:58,559 --> 00:37:59,292
How are you, ladies?

453
00:37:59,294 --> 00:38:02,061
You all right, Christina?
You look very pale.

454
00:38:02,063 --> 00:38:04,730
Pale is the in vogue fashion,
Mr. O'Reilly.

455
00:38:04,732 --> 00:38:07,700
Well, just make sure you're
getting enough to eat now.

456
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,968
Don't be spending
all your wages

457
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,770
in the in vogue fashions,
will you?

458
00:38:26,118 --> 00:38:30,221
Ten more payments and you can
choose your mum's stone.

459
00:38:30,223 --> 00:38:32,957
Then I'm going to carve
her name for free.

460
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:35,992
Oh, thank you.

461
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:53,609
Excuse me.

462
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:46,024
Can I help you up there, miss?

463
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:47,258
No, you're all right.

464
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,227
I can get up on my own.

465
00:39:51,364 --> 00:39:53,230
Put your foot into my hands.

466
00:39:53,232 --> 00:39:55,767
I'll hoist up, no bother.

467
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,874
There you go.

468
00:40:05,743 --> 00:40:07,944
Let go of me. I'm over now.

469
00:40:07,946 --> 00:40:10,713
Come on back down here
for a second, young one.

470
00:40:10,715 --> 00:40:11,648
Let go of me I said.

471
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,083
I'd love to look up
what's up your skirt there.

472
00:40:14,085 --> 00:40:15,985
Let go of me I said!

473
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:18,420
No! No!

474
00:40:18,422 --> 00:40:21,723
We'll just have a bit
of fun, that's all.

475
00:40:21,725 --> 00:40:23,225
Let's get rid of her quick.

476
00:40:27,997 --> 00:40:30,097
Should we toss a coin, lads?

477
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:32,800
Head or tail, huh?

478
00:40:44,045 --> 00:40:46,112
Grab her legs, that's it.

479
00:40:46,114 --> 00:40:48,114
Leave the girl, will you?

480
00:41:33,056 --> 00:41:36,992
<i>You've let me down very badly.</i>

481
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,328
<i>And I want to know why?</i>

482
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:42,299
<i>So you better have something
very good in store for me,</i>

483
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:44,500
<i>to make it up to me,</i>

484
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,335
<i>all right, God?</i>

485
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,238
I do think
you are a good worker.

486
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,341
It's just you can't go missing
for all that time

487
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,009
without so much
as a by your leave,

488
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:56,745
and expect your job to be here

489
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:57,512
whenever you pop up again.

490
00:41:57,514 --> 00:42:02,182
That's just not the way
the world works.

491
00:42:03,485 --> 00:42:05,486
Sweet Jesus!

492
00:42:17,498 --> 00:42:21,234
I need to find a way
to help these kids.

493
00:42:21,236 --> 00:42:24,170
<i>Bui doi, the dust of life.</i>

494
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:26,405
That's what I was once,

495
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:29,341
just like Tao and Han and Lam

496
00:42:29,343 --> 00:42:32,011
and thousands of other kids.

497
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:33,980
I can't afford
to make anymore mistakes,

498
00:42:33,982 --> 00:42:36,448
or I'll get
kicked out of this country.

499
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:40,317
I need you
to tell me what to do.

500
00:42:42,988 --> 00:42:44,488
I'll tell you what.

501
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,391
I'll walk, you lead.

502
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,963
<i>Kahm uhn.</i>

503
00:43:28,965 --> 00:43:32,166
This is private property.
Can I help you?

504
00:43:32,168 --> 00:43:35,202
Sorry, the kite
came over the wall outside.

505
00:43:35,204 --> 00:43:37,537
Thank you for returning it.

506
00:43:40,975 --> 00:43:42,408
Is this a school?

507
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,978
No, it is
a government orphanage

508
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,513
of Binh Dai district,

509
00:43:47,515 --> 00:43:49,381
private property. Thank you.

510
00:43:49,383 --> 00:43:53,385
Is it ever possible
to visit the children?

511
00:43:56,489 --> 00:43:58,056
Sometimes...

512
00:43:58,058 --> 00:44:01,259
but strictly with permission.

513
00:44:01,261 --> 00:44:02,460
Right,

514
00:44:02,462 --> 00:44:05,897
who do I apply to
for permission?

515
00:44:08,367 --> 00:44:09,967
Me.

516
00:44:57,479 --> 00:45:00,614
The evasive agent arrange.

517
00:45:02,317 --> 00:45:03,616
Up here all the children

518
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:07,120
brought to us
severely malnourished.

519
00:45:23,436 --> 00:45:26,504
Are you a wealthy woman,
Mrs. Noble?

520
00:45:26,506 --> 00:45:29,340
I wish I could say that I was.

521
00:45:29,342 --> 00:45:32,644
Our history
is full of foreigners

522
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,613
who thought they could help.

523
00:45:34,615 --> 00:45:39,050
Maybe we don't need
anymore disappointment.

524
00:45:39,052 --> 00:45:40,451
I understand that.

525
00:45:40,453 --> 00:45:46,022
What is it that you intend to
do for the sweet children?

526
00:45:46,024 --> 00:45:49,693
I don't know yet exactly.

527
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,062
That is a good start.

528
00:45:52,496 --> 00:45:53,964
When I was much younger

529
00:45:53,966 --> 00:45:56,633
I had a dream
about your country.

530
00:45:56,635 --> 00:45:58,000
I don't know why.

531
00:45:58,002 --> 00:46:00,369
No doctor or psychiatrist
could explain

532
00:46:00,371 --> 00:46:02,037
why I became obsessed
with a country

533
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:04,506
that I wouldn't have been able
to show them on a map.

534
00:46:04,508 --> 00:46:08,644
Madame Linh,
this may sound mad to you,

535
00:46:08,646 --> 00:46:12,013
but today, right here,

536
00:46:12,015 --> 00:46:14,315
I have my explanation.

537
00:46:15,617 --> 00:46:18,519
Come and see me again tomorrow.

538
00:46:21,123 --> 00:46:22,390
Thank you.

539
00:46:24,294 --> 00:46:26,294
Good morning, Christina,

540
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:27,761
or should I say good afternoon?

541
00:46:27,763 --> 00:46:30,430
That was a long sleep you had.

542
00:46:38,472 --> 00:46:41,273
Well, rest, recuperation,

543
00:46:41,275 --> 00:46:43,476
get you back
to the full of your health.

544
00:46:43,478 --> 00:46:44,642
That's what we're about here.

545
00:46:44,644 --> 00:46:47,313
So let's just get you
signed in, will we?

546
00:46:47,314 --> 00:46:50,349
A little bit like a hotel.

547
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:55,186
Now.

548
00:46:55,188 --> 00:46:57,655
Just here.

549
00:47:01,093 --> 00:47:03,360
What age are you, Sister Laura?

550
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:04,628
Thirty-one. Why?

551
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,665
Did you always
want to become a nun?

552
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:10,501
Always.

553
00:47:10,503 --> 00:47:11,735
What about you, Christina?

554
00:47:11,737 --> 00:47:13,537
Did you ever think
about a vocation?

555
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,672
Never.

556
00:47:34,657 --> 00:47:37,825
Sorry I had to bring you
to the nuns, Christina.

557
00:47:37,827 --> 00:47:39,661
It's the only place
that'd take you in.

558
00:47:39,663 --> 00:47:44,231
There was no way they would
let me visit you before now.

559
00:47:44,233 --> 00:47:47,134
"Three months of rest,
no excitements."

560
00:47:47,136 --> 00:47:49,403
I told them I wasn't exciting.

561
00:47:49,405 --> 00:47:53,207
"Come back in 3 months,
not before."

562
00:47:53,209 --> 00:47:55,809
I think
you saved my life, Joan.

563
00:47:56,677 --> 00:47:58,278
This lot are grand,

564
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,547
not like those kind
of lunatics.

565
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:03,115
I'm forgiven so?

566
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:05,117
Just about.

567
00:48:05,653 --> 00:48:07,753
I'm going to England, Shoes.

568
00:48:07,755 --> 00:48:10,255
Getting out of this
kip of a place.

569
00:48:10,257 --> 00:48:11,256
Where will you go to?

570
00:48:11,258 --> 00:48:15,327
Birmingham, I've a brother
who lives there.

571
00:48:16,529 --> 00:48:17,862
Would you come with me?

572
00:48:17,864 --> 00:48:20,099
I have no penny to go with.

573
00:48:20,101 --> 00:48:20,833
I'll lend you the money.

574
00:48:20,835 --> 00:48:23,768
You can pay me back
when you get a job.

575
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,736
What do you think?

576
00:48:26,738 --> 00:48:28,840
Will there be any excitements?

577
00:48:28,842 --> 00:48:32,642
There will be, loads.

578
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,580
Sister Laura, please!

579
00:48:36,582 --> 00:48:37,747
Don't be ridiculous, Christina.

580
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:39,716
What's wrong with me
going to England?

581
00:48:39,718 --> 00:48:41,118
There's nothing for me here.

582
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,254
Would you have some common
sense for God's sake.

583
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:46,156
What do you mean?

584
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:49,825
You are going
to have a baby, Christina.

585
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:53,262
Me?

586
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:54,463
Yes.

587
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:56,499
Why else do you think
you're excused

588
00:48:56,501 --> 00:48:57,466
from heavy cleaning work?

589
00:48:57,468 --> 00:48:59,534
And you get second helpings
at dinner

590
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,469
whenever you want them.

591
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:27,728
He's called Thomas,
after my dad.

592
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,662
Hello, Thomas.

593
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:32,864
He's gorgeous, Shoes.

594
00:49:36,402 --> 00:49:38,770
So I picked up
the ferry tickets yesterday.

595
00:49:38,772 --> 00:49:40,173
What's your plan for Saturday?

596
00:49:40,175 --> 00:49:41,940
I'll tell them, I'll take him
out in the pram

597
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:43,341
for a couple of hours.

598
00:49:43,343 --> 00:49:44,276
That's my usual.

599
00:49:44,278 --> 00:49:45,844
Then I'll get the bus
to northwall.

600
00:49:45,846 --> 00:49:47,611
I'll meet you there
at 5 o'clock.

601
00:49:47,613 --> 00:49:49,748
Don't you dare be late now.

602
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,816
I'll go without you.

603
00:49:52,585 --> 00:49:54,218
I will.

604
00:50:16,439 --> 00:50:17,606
Someone's moved Thomas.

605
00:50:17,608 --> 00:50:19,575
Was he taken to the nurse
to be weighed again?

606
00:50:19,577 --> 00:50:20,509
Calm down, Christina.

607
00:50:20,511 --> 00:50:21,843
Tell me where he is,
Sister Laura, please.

608
00:50:21,845 --> 00:50:26,914
Thomas isn't here anymore. It's in
his best interest. Where is he?

609
00:50:26,916 --> 00:50:30,552
You're only 17.
You haven't got a husband.

610
00:50:30,554 --> 00:50:31,853
What's that got
to do with this?

611
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:34,422
Thomas has gone
to a good Catholic family

612
00:50:34,424 --> 00:50:36,724
where he'll get
the very best of care.

613
00:50:36,726 --> 00:50:38,226
So when do I get to see him?

614
00:50:38,228 --> 00:50:40,294
Well, I'll go and get
my things together.

615
00:50:40,296 --> 00:50:42,997
He's been adopted, Christina.

616
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:45,766
What?

617
00:50:45,768 --> 00:50:46,666
But you can't do that.

618
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:51,271
But you signed the papers,
that first day you came here,

619
00:50:51,273 --> 00:50:52,672
do you not remember?

620
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,307
No.

621
00:50:54,874 --> 00:50:59,678
No, oh, my God.

622
00:51:01,281 --> 00:51:02,715
Oh.

623
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,687
I forgive you for that,
Christina.

624
00:51:19,697 --> 00:51:24,501
I don't know what to say
to you except that...

625
00:51:24,637 --> 00:51:28,572
now we both know
what it's like to lose a son.

626
00:51:28,574 --> 00:51:30,274
I'm not being blasphemous.

627
00:51:30,276 --> 00:51:32,975
I'm not comparing
myself to you.

628
00:51:32,977 --> 00:51:35,512
It's just that first I believe,

629
00:51:35,514 --> 00:51:39,949
but now I won't be
able to keep going.

630
00:51:41,485 --> 00:51:42,752
I won't survive.

631
00:51:42,754 --> 00:51:45,988
I hope you're gonna explain
this to me, very bloody soon.

632
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:48,857
So until then you're gonna
have to listen to me

633
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:50,293
swear and curse and shout,

634
00:51:50,295 --> 00:51:53,762
and I won't be asking
for your forgiveness.

635
00:51:53,764 --> 00:51:55,630
Sorry about that.

636
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:10,344
This is the name
of the government department

637
00:52:10,346 --> 00:52:12,446
you must contact.

638
00:52:12,448 --> 00:52:15,616
It is forbidden
for any foreigner to work

639
00:52:15,618 --> 00:52:18,851
in Vietnam without a red stamp.

640
00:52:18,853 --> 00:52:19,887
Mm-hmm.

641
00:52:19,889 --> 00:52:24,724
Ask for Mr. Ku
and mention my name.

642
00:52:24,726 --> 00:52:26,591
I will, thank you.

643
00:52:26,593 --> 00:52:29,828
And if you want to help
the street children,

644
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:33,465
you will need
to understand their dangers.

645
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:36,401
I would like you to meet Trung.

646
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,504
He will show you what I mean.

647
00:52:41,473 --> 00:52:44,376
I've never
had a bodyguard before.

648
00:52:44,378 --> 00:52:46,811
I never been
a bodyguard before.

649
00:52:47,446 --> 00:52:49,347
What do you normally do?

650
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:50,948
I used to be a duck farmer.

651
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,083
A duck farmer?

652
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:56,486
Yes, duck is big business
in Vietnam.

653
00:52:56,488 --> 00:52:59,356
Quack-quack, chop-chop.

654
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:01,624
I feel safer already, Trung.

655
00:53:03,493 --> 00:53:05,861
What's this building used for?

656
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:08,964
Not used.

657
00:53:57,543 --> 00:53:59,612
Hello.

658
00:54:00,579 --> 00:54:03,616
It is not usual
to give a work permit

659
00:54:03,618 --> 00:54:06,017
to a foreigner like this.

660
00:54:06,019 --> 00:54:07,184
I do appreciate that,

661
00:54:07,186 --> 00:54:09,754
and I'm grateful
for your consideration.

662
00:54:09,756 --> 00:54:11,756
What will you bring
to Madame Linh?

663
00:54:11,758 --> 00:54:14,691
I will bring hard work,
and passion,

664
00:54:14,693 --> 00:54:18,028
love for the children,
my heart.

665
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,730
Your heart?

666
00:54:19,732 --> 00:54:20,998
And money, I hope.

667
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,199
Oh, yes, and money.

668
00:54:23,201 --> 00:54:25,935
Where will you get
this money from?

669
00:54:25,937 --> 00:54:29,839
You let me worry about that,
Mr. Ku, I have my ways.

670
00:54:29,841 --> 00:54:33,843
Is there anything else
that you would like to say

671
00:54:33,845 --> 00:54:35,077
before we make our decision?

672
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:38,181
Would you mind
if I sang you a song.

673
00:54:38,183 --> 00:54:39,514
A song?

674
00:54:39,516 --> 00:54:41,149
It's an Irish tradition.

675
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,486
I just give you
the one verse, okay?

676
00:54:44,488 --> 00:54:49,890
♪ Come over the hills,
my handsome Irish lad ♪

677
00:54:49,892 --> 00:54:55,563
♪ Come over the hills
to your darling ♪

678
00:54:55,565 --> 00:55:01,135
♪ You choose the road, love,
and I'll make a vow ♪

679
00:55:01,137 --> 00:55:08,142
♪ That I'll be your true love
forever ♪

680
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:11,478
Thank you.

681
00:55:17,017 --> 00:55:20,819
Thank you for your application,
Miss Noble.

682
00:55:20,821 --> 00:55:23,956
We are interested
in what you say

683
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:26,191
and we like the way
that you say it.

684
00:55:26,193 --> 00:55:28,660
You're very kind.

685
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:30,761
We will give you a work permit.

686
00:55:30,763 --> 00:55:33,264
Oh, that's brilliant.

687
00:55:33,266 --> 00:55:35,166
For 3 months.

688
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:37,768
Three months?

689
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:39,269
That's not very long, Mr. Ku.

690
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:44,774
Let's see what your heart
can do in 3 months.

691
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,629
I'm checking out.

692
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:08,264
I can see that.

693
00:56:08,266 --> 00:56:09,697
<i>I'm going to live
with the bui doi.</i>

694
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,800
They offered a better quality
of cockroach

695
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:12,968
than the Coronet Hotel.

696
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,770
Aha, see, I told
you I'd get a smile

697
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,072
out of you before I left.
No smile.

698
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:20,841
Oh, yes.
You smile like a little baby.

699
00:56:20,843 --> 00:56:23,778
I'll see you around,
Mr. Reception Desk,

700
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,712
don't forget me now.

701
00:56:25,714 --> 00:56:27,948
I forgot you already.

702
00:56:31,819 --> 00:56:34,020
This way.

703
00:56:38,926 --> 00:56:41,294
Judy say, "Cheap, cheap place."

704
00:56:41,296 --> 00:56:43,930
I need to save
all the money I can, Mia.

705
00:56:43,932 --> 00:56:46,131
People here will
think you are insane.

706
00:56:46,133 --> 00:56:50,168
Yeah, well, a little insane
goes a long way.

707
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:04,915
It's not far from Madame Linh.

708
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:25,000
It's perfect.

709
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:32,708
<i>Dear, sir,
I'm writing on behalf</i>

710
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,743
<i>of the street children
of Ho Chi Minh City.</i>

711
00:57:34,745 --> 00:57:37,179
<i>I'm trying to raise funds
for the building</i>

712
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:40,382
<i>of a Social and Medical
Center in district 3.</i>

713
00:57:40,384 --> 00:57:42,149
<i>If your company will be
interested in helping</i>

714
00:57:42,151 --> 00:57:45,353
<i>to improve the circumstances
of these children,</i>

715
00:57:45,355 --> 00:57:47,188
<i>I will be very grateful.</i>

716
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,723
<i>Perhaps I could
come to your offices</i>

717
00:57:48,725 --> 00:57:51,358
<i>to make a sure presentation
about my plans.</i>

718
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,026
<i>I look forward
to hearing from you.</i>

719
00:57:53,028 --> 00:57:56,129
<i>Yours sincerely,
Christina Noble.</i>

720
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:05,672
Finished?

721
00:58:05,674 --> 00:58:07,641
Yes, 19 letters to deliver.

722
00:58:07,643 --> 00:58:10,109
You're going to have
a busy day tomorrow.

723
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,077
I dream of a busy day.

724
00:58:12,278 --> 00:58:13,412
What else do you dream of, Lam?

725
00:58:13,414 --> 00:58:18,050
I dream of a busy day,
that's all.

726
00:58:26,691 --> 00:58:30,227
I have always wanted
to rebuild this,

727
00:58:30,229 --> 00:58:32,929
but never had the money.

728
00:58:49,681 --> 00:58:51,747
Hey.

729
00:58:52,382 --> 00:58:55,284
What the hell are you doing,
you mad woman.

730
00:58:55,286 --> 00:58:57,786
You're trying to get
yourself killed?

731
00:58:57,788 --> 00:58:58,353
Are you Irish?

732
00:58:58,355 --> 00:59:01,723
Amongst many other
fine attributes, yes.

733
00:59:01,725 --> 00:59:03,024
I need to talk to you.

734
00:59:03,026 --> 00:59:03,758
What about?

735
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,927
It'll sound better mixed
with whiskey.

736
00:59:07,129 --> 00:59:10,832
All right, I'll see you inside.

737
00:59:18,907 --> 00:59:21,908
And I'm not just talking about
the facility that's so so.

738
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:24,377
I'm talking about a place
that you'll be proud of

739
00:59:24,379 --> 00:59:26,212
if it was in Dublin or London.

740
00:59:26,214 --> 00:59:28,481
Treating Third World children
the same

741
00:59:28,483 --> 00:59:29,749
as First World children.

742
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:33,252
BlueRock Oil could be
a founding sponsor, Gerry.

743
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:36,823
I have to go in.

744
00:59:36,825 --> 00:59:39,791
And what can I say, Christina,
I'll read your proposal.

745
00:59:39,793 --> 00:59:42,227
I'll show it to a couple
of colleagues

746
00:59:42,229 --> 00:59:43,995
and I'll give you a call.

747
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,996
I bet you say
that to all the girls.

748
00:59:45,998 --> 00:59:50,102
No, only the crazy ones.

749
01:00:33,776 --> 01:00:35,243
Okay, Lam?

750
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:41,915
Okay, Mama Tina,
Lam has another dream.

751
01:00:41,917 --> 01:00:43,550
Do you want to tell me?

752
01:00:45,153 --> 01:00:50,323
When my father died,
my mother was very lonely.

753
01:00:50,325 --> 01:00:54,360
No money,
me and two older brothers

754
01:00:54,362 --> 01:00:57,463
at home, very hungry.

755
01:00:57,465 --> 01:01:02,001
Then Mr. Rat
moved in with my mother.

756
01:01:02,003 --> 01:01:07,039
He beat us, throw us
out onto the street.

757
01:01:07,041 --> 01:01:08,174
I miss my mother.

758
01:01:08,176 --> 01:01:12,877
I dream that one day
I'll see my mother again.

759
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,414
I have the same dream, Lam.

760
01:01:30,261 --> 01:01:33,463
I wish you'd come...

761
01:01:33,465 --> 01:01:34,497
Do you good to get out.

762
01:01:34,499 --> 01:01:37,401
You've been in here
nearly 2 months now.

763
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:39,302
Any day, Joanny, I promise.

764
01:01:39,304 --> 01:01:41,470
There'll be no holding me
back then.

765
01:01:41,472 --> 01:01:44,440
Stop your nagging,
is that what you mean?

766
01:01:47,444 --> 01:01:49,511
I'll try not to wake you.

767
01:02:03,225 --> 01:02:05,893
<i>Hello, how may I help you?</i>

768
01:02:05,895 --> 01:02:08,429
I'd like to apply for the job
in the Fish and Chip shop.

769
01:02:08,431 --> 01:02:11,198
<i>Do you have
experience working chips?</i>

770
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:14,000
Well, I haven't, no.

771
01:02:14,002 --> 01:02:16,469
I've plenty experience
eating them.

772
01:02:21,909 --> 01:02:25,144
Three cod large, salt and
vinegar on those? Yeah.

773
01:02:25,146 --> 01:02:28,146
And a smoked herring
and a single for you, sir.

774
01:02:28,148 --> 01:02:29,014
Thank you.

775
01:02:29,016 --> 01:02:30,182
Who's next now?

776
01:02:30,184 --> 01:02:31,917
Yes, Mrs. Hennessey,
the usual, is it?

777
01:02:31,919 --> 01:02:33,218
Well, that'd be lovely.
Underway.

778
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:36,121
Another bucket of chips there, Jimmy.
We're good.

779
01:02:36,123 --> 01:02:40,057
Now who's gonna play for
a hired working girl?

780
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:40,892
I will.

781
01:02:40,894 --> 01:02:42,994
Oh, true gentleman at last.

782
01:02:42,996 --> 01:02:45,997
Watch and learn, all you lads.
...you say.

783
01:02:45,999 --> 01:02:48,532
All right.
Two pickled eggs, she says.

784
01:02:48,534 --> 01:02:51,936
Okay. Music is the way
to a woman's heart,

785
01:02:51,938 --> 01:02:53,270
is it not right, Mr. Olden?

786
01:02:53,272 --> 01:02:55,473

802
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:41,982
And sea is so bright blue
just like a...

803
01:03:42,582 --> 01:03:45,318
like... there's nothing
here that blue.

804
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:47,720
Do you know the color
that is called turquoise?

805
01:03:47,722 --> 01:03:48,587
Where we you come from,

806
01:03:48,589 --> 01:03:51,958
turquoise is big birds you
kill and eat for Christmas.

807
01:03:52,493 --> 01:03:56,495
So what brought you here then,
Mario, to Birmingham?

808
01:03:56,497 --> 01:03:58,663
You maybe.

809
01:03:58,665 --> 01:04:03,501
Charmer, go away back
to the warm blue sea with you.

810
01:04:03,503 --> 01:04:06,037
Don't listen
to a word, Christina.

811
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:11,075
I'm not so much charmer,
more straight, direct.

812
01:04:11,077 --> 01:04:12,643
You know?

813
01:04:12,645 --> 01:04:13,711
I like you Joan.

814
01:04:13,713 --> 01:04:18,649
You're funny
like comedy, you know.

815
01:04:33,496 --> 01:04:37,566
The house rules, I lock
the front door at 9 o'clock

816
01:04:37,568 --> 01:04:39,235
so you must be in by then.

817
01:04:39,237 --> 01:04:41,670
No exceptions and no late entry.

818
01:04:41,672 --> 01:04:46,408
Breakfast to serve
from 7 o'clock to 8 o'clock.

819
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:47,009
No pets.

820
01:04:47,011 --> 01:04:50,311
No visitors,
and no inappropriate

821
01:04:50,313 --> 01:04:51,779
or immoral behavior.

822
01:04:51,781 --> 01:04:55,217
The car park's
at your own risk.

823
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:12,232
Sorry, I'm late, Mr. Olden.

824
01:05:12,234 --> 01:05:13,466
The bus broke down
on Mosey Street,

825
01:05:13,468 --> 01:05:15,735
the whole place
is flooded down there.

826
01:05:15,737 --> 01:05:19,371
Congratulations, Christina,
you got a new boss.

827
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,673
Mario has given me
a very generous retirement.

828
01:05:21,675 --> 01:05:24,409
No, no, no,
Christina is the boss.

829
01:05:30,282 --> 01:05:32,717
They're happy tears.

830
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:35,086
Mario has been so good to me.

831
01:05:35,088 --> 01:05:38,388
Nobody has been this good to me
since my mum died.

832
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:40,757
Huh, except me.

833
01:05:40,759 --> 01:05:42,426
Except you.

834
01:05:42,428 --> 01:05:46,097
Oh, I'm gonna miss you, Shoes.

835
01:05:54,672 --> 01:05:56,372
Mario's.

836
01:05:56,374 --> 01:05:59,208

<i>What they have claimed
to protect.</i>

846
01:06:39,781 --> 01:06:41,647
<i>But Viet Cong
still concentrated in strength</i>

847
01:06:41,649 --> 01:06:44,383
<i>closing around the major
centers of the nation...</i>

848
01:06:44,385 --> 01:06:46,118
What can I get you?

849
01:06:47,153 --> 01:06:49,721
<i>The bulldozers plow
under the rubble of the homes</i>

850
01:06:49,723 --> 01:06:51,823
<i>and the burnt acres
where the Viet Cong</i>

851
01:06:51,825 --> 01:06:53,125
<i>held out for the first days.</i>

852
01:06:53,127 --> 01:06:55,693
<i>The communists have succeeded
in providing</i>

853
01:06:55,695 --> 01:06:58,196
<i>massive new distractions
of re-housing,</i>

854
01:06:58,198 --> 01:06:59,865
<i>and relief,
and rebuilding to add</i>

855
01:06:59,867 --> 01:07:02,466
<i>to the burdens
of a creaking government.</i>

856
01:07:02,468 --> 01:07:03,834
<i>At the moment,
everyone is waiting</i>

857
01:07:03,836 --> 01:07:06,804
<i>for the expected
second wave of attacks.</i>

858
01:07:06,806 --> 01:07:08,538
<i>Viet Cong have taken
heavy casualties</i>

859
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:12,142
<i>that may dictate a delay
perhaps to intensify recruiting</i>

860
01:07:12,144 --> 01:07:14,344
<i>in new areas
under their control.</i>

861
01:07:14,346 --> 01:07:18,848
<i>Michael Carlton reporting

<i>and missing soviets

869
01:07:36,166 --> 01:07:39,535
It's the bright blue sky.

870
01:07:39,537 --> 01:07:42,237
I've told you before. They're
not bloody well going with you.

871
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:44,739
Why not? Because I don't have
a good feeling about this.

872
01:07:44,741 --> 01:07:47,175
You don't have a good feeling
about my children,

873
01:07:47,177 --> 01:07:49,510
visiting an 80-year-old aunt
who has traveled all the way

874
01:07:49,512 --> 01:07:51,913
from Cyprus, who will only
give them sweets and kisses?

875
01:07:51,915 --> 01:07:54,514
It's not your aunt
I'm worried about.

876
01:07:54,516 --> 01:07:55,615
What then?

877
01:07:55,617 --> 01:07:56,816
It's all your showing off,

878
01:07:56,818 --> 01:07:59,653
and driving at 100 miles an hour
like you always do.

879
01:07:59,655 --> 01:08:01,221
What do you know
what I always do, huh?

880
01:08:01,223 --> 01:08:03,890
Shut up talking
for once in your life.

881
01:08:04,792 --> 01:08:06,625
Gladly.

882
01:08:06,627 --> 01:08:10,863
You're a stupid Irish bitch,
you know that?

883
01:08:18,371 --> 01:08:20,972
Maybe you also a witch, huh?

884
01:08:20,974 --> 01:08:23,608
Putting spells on people.

885
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:26,277
My children
would have been killed

886
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:28,545
or maimed if they'd
been in that car.

887
01:08:28,547 --> 01:08:31,415
I'm gonna do something
about you.

888
01:08:31,417 --> 01:08:33,450
Yeah?

889
01:08:33,452 --> 01:08:36,653
I'm gonna do something
about you too.

890
01:08:47,731 --> 01:08:49,298
Do you know who I am?

891
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:51,634
I know what you are.

892
01:08:51,636 --> 01:08:53,703
What am I?

893
01:08:53,705 --> 01:08:56,339
A fish wife.

894
01:09:01,545 --> 01:09:03,678
Get your own husband.

895
01:09:09,652 --> 01:09:12,686
He'll come after me, Joan.

896
01:09:12,688 --> 01:09:13,555
He always does.

897
01:09:13,557 --> 01:09:15,656
This can't go on, Shoes.

898
01:09:15,658 --> 01:09:18,359
You're lucky you
didn't lose an eye.

899
01:09:18,493 --> 01:09:20,594
What'll he do the next time?

900
01:10:12,742 --> 01:10:15,944
I need to know
that you're still there.

901
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,316
Have you forgotten me
completely?

902
01:12:24,765 --> 01:12:26,498
<i>I don't think Joan believed me</i>

903
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,534
<i>when I told her
you sent me the dream.</i>

904
01:12:28,536 --> 01:12:29,902
<i>She's more worried about me now</i>

905
01:12:29,904 --> 01:12:31,737
<i>than when I was dead
to the world.</i>

906
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:33,972
<i>But I know you've sent it</i>

907
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:35,941
<i>and I know I have to follow it,</i>

908
01:12:35,943 --> 01:12:38,810
<i>just give me
a bit of time, will you?</i>

909
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:43,648
<i>I will go to Vietnam,
I swear to Almighty you,</i>

910
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,917
<i>when the time comes
nothing would stop me</i>

911
01:12:46,919 --> 01:12:49,520
<i>and You better be
coming with me.</i>

912
01:12:58,763 --> 01:13:00,030
Well, they're rubbish.

913
01:13:00,032 --> 01:13:02,465
Thanks for keeping
them for me, Fan.

914
01:13:02,467 --> 01:13:03,632
No good news?

915
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:04,133
No, not today.

916
01:13:04,135 --> 01:13:07,002
Maybe it's not your destiny.
What isn't?

917
01:13:07,005 --> 01:13:09,939
<i>Looking after these bui doi,
maybe you can't do it.</i>

918
01:13:09,941 --> 01:13:12,007
There's no such thing as can't.

919
01:13:12,009 --> 01:13:13,642
You tell him, Christina.

920
01:13:13,644 --> 01:13:14,943
You get me this number in Hanoi

921
01:13:14,945 --> 01:13:17,146
and I'll take it in
booth three.

922
01:13:17,148 --> 01:13:18,213
Okay.

923
01:13:18,215 --> 01:13:19,948
Who's this little man?

924
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:20,748
This is Lam.

925
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:21,950
He's my new business partner.

926
01:13:21,952 --> 01:13:24,252
We're waiting for everything
to go whoosh.

927
01:13:24,254 --> 01:13:26,220
Very funny. Hello, Lam.

928
01:13:26,222 --> 01:13:28,656
He's got look of a young
Jimmy Cagney about him...

929
01:13:29,526 --> 01:13:31,024
Something in the eyes I think.

930
01:13:31,026 --> 01:13:32,593
Your call.

931
01:13:32,595 --> 01:13:33,061
Great.

932
01:13:33,063 --> 01:13:36,196
Don't let her
work you too hard.

933
01:13:39,067 --> 01:13:41,602
From here
to the end of that wall.

934
01:13:41,604 --> 01:13:43,002
Yeah.

935
01:13:56,516 --> 01:14:01,019
Just having a child
is difficult for poor people

936
01:14:01,021 --> 01:14:03,854
in Ho Chi Minh City.

937
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:06,892
If there is a birth defect,

938
01:14:06,894 --> 01:14:10,795
they think they are being
punished by fate

939
01:14:10,797 --> 01:14:13,564
and they abandon the child.

940
01:14:14,065 --> 01:14:15,165
Abandon where?

941
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:18,302
In this place, in the garbage.

942
01:14:18,904 --> 01:14:23,908
We always give babies a name
when they arrive.

943
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:29,145
We call her Mai,
it means cherry blossom.

944
01:14:29,147 --> 01:14:30,980
Will Mai live?

945
01:14:30,982 --> 01:14:34,950
The infection
on her head is bad.

946
01:14:34,952 --> 01:14:36,319
We will see.

and I work
for the street children

957
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:31,035
of Ho Chi Minh City.

958
01:15:31,037 --> 01:15:32,270
There's a lot of them
as you know

959
01:15:32,272 --> 01:15:35,707
and they need love and looking
after as much as the next kid.

960
01:15:35,709 --> 01:15:39,611
So if you can help us,
we'll be very grateful.

01:16:19,114 --> 01:16:22,917
We make it happen
before the year ends.

964
01:16:22,919 --> 01:16:23,350
Yeah.

965
01:16:23,352 --> 01:16:25,654
Listen, can I call you back?

966
01:16:25,656 --> 01:16:27,955
Something's just come in.

967
01:16:28,723 --> 01:16:30,157
All right.

968
01:16:30,824 --> 01:16:32,092
Can you give me
half an hour, Gerry?

969
01:16:32,094 --> 01:16:34,862
I'm afraid you'll have
to make an appointment

970
01:16:34,864 --> 01:16:37,430
just like anyone else,
Christina.

971
01:16:37,432 --> 01:16:40,767
Do you not take a lunch break?

972
01:16:54,347 --> 01:16:59,051
Texas, Siberia, Vietnam,
or everywhere.

973
01:16:59,053 --> 01:17:00,919
You'd be surprised
how many parties

974
01:17:00,921 --> 01:17:02,353
there are in the oil business.

975
01:17:02,355 --> 01:17:04,155
Why is that do you think?

976
01:17:04,157 --> 01:17:08,392
Because we are
very good at digging.

977
01:17:09,361 --> 01:17:10,227
Years of practice.

978
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:11,729
I always thought
people drill for oil.

979
01:17:11,731 --> 01:17:14,264
Well, that's exactly
where they've been going wrong.

980
01:17:14,266 --> 01:17:16,133
Digging is the new drilling.

981
01:17:16,135 --> 01:17:16,766
Is it?

982
01:17:16,768 --> 01:17:18,968
It is,
and that is our company motto

983
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:22,372
and that is why we are
top of the heap.

984
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:27,276
And what do you see
when you look down, Gerry?

985
01:17:27,278 --> 01:17:29,712
Ah, you don't look down,
Christina.

986
01:17:29,714 --> 01:17:31,246
Isn't that what they tell you?

987
01:17:31,248 --> 01:17:34,183
Because you might get
vertigo and fall.

988
01:17:34,185 --> 01:17:35,384
That's right.

989
01:17:35,386 --> 01:17:38,987
Don't you be worrying,
I'll catch ya.

990
01:18:29,769 --> 01:18:33,337
Hello, Mr. Ban, hello, Wade.
Hello, Mama Tina.

991
01:18:33,339 --> 01:18:37,274
I brought you some rice
and toys on my way.

992
01:18:41,112 --> 01:18:45,248
This is my friend, Gerry.
He wanted to meet you also.

993
01:19:03,032 --> 01:19:05,066
<i>Mama Tina, Mama Tina.</i>

994
01:19:05,068 --> 01:19:08,804
<i>Must come now,
please, must come now.</i>

995
01:19:08,806 --> 01:19:09,336
What is it?

996
01:19:09,338 --> 01:19:11,806
Mama Tina. I'm coming, Lam.

997
01:19:21,883 --> 01:19:23,249
Okay, Lam, you stay here.

998
01:19:23,251 --> 01:19:24,351
You mind the bike, okay?

999
01:19:24,353 --> 01:19:27,120
Don't worry, don't worry.

1000
01:19:40,301 --> 01:19:42,401
It is him. Bastard.

1001
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:44,903
How old is that girl?

1002
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:46,004
I would say 10.

1003
01:19:46,006 --> 01:19:47,405
So would I.

1004
01:19:48,273 --> 01:19:51,075
You better careful, Christina.

1005
01:19:51,511 --> 01:19:53,912
This man always dangerous.

1006
01:19:59,851 --> 01:20:02,019
Just in here.

1007
01:20:13,496 --> 01:20:16,298
A foreigner has just taken
a young girl up to his bedroom.

1008
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:19,001
You call him, tell him
bring her down, now.

1009
01:20:19,003 --> 01:20:20,569
What you say? Trung, please.

1010
01:20:28,411 --> 01:20:30,945
What are they saying? They're
asking if anyone know who you are.

1011
01:20:30,947 --> 01:20:36,150
It doesn't matter who I am. There's a
dangerous man up there with a child.

1012
01:20:36,152 --> 01:20:36,992
Get the manager, now.

1013
01:20:44,225 --> 01:20:47,960
Come on, come on, for God's sake.
What do you want?

1014
01:20:47,962 --> 01:20:49,463
I want you to do something
about the fact

1015
01:20:49,465 --> 01:20:51,964
that your hotel
is being used by foreigners

1016
01:20:51,966 --> 01:20:54,166
to abuse Vietnamese children.

1017
01:20:54,168 --> 01:20:54,634
Get out.

1018
01:20:54,636 --> 01:20:56,969
This is a good place,
three stars.

1019
01:20:56,971 --> 01:20:57,970
I have just seen one of them

1020
01:20:57,972 --> 01:20:59,939
take a child up
in the elevator.

1021
01:20:59,941 --> 01:21:01,040
His name is David Summers.

1022
01:21:01,042 --> 01:21:02,275
You call him,
you get him down here

1023
01:21:02,277 --> 01:21:04,143
or we will go up
and break the door in.

1024
01:21:04,145 --> 01:21:06,978
What'd he say?

1025
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:09,180
He says you have to go
or he'll call the police.

1026
01:21:09,182 --> 01:21:12,150
Yes, call the police, that's
exactly what you should do.

1027
01:21:12,152 --> 01:21:14,586
I ask you
for the last time to get out.

1028
01:21:14,588 --> 01:21:17,222
I don't know you,
why are you causing trouble?

1029
01:21:17,224 --> 01:21:19,056
Listen to me, I have
been given permission

1030
01:21:19,058 --> 01:21:20,991
by the government to look
after these children,

1031
01:21:20,993 --> 01:21:23,928
to stop them
from being raped in your hotel.

1032
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:25,029
Now you get that man down here

1033
01:21:25,031 --> 01:21:28,132
or I will call
Inspector Bong myself.

1034
01:21:34,072 --> 01:21:36,572
Would you do this to a 10-year-old
girl in your own country?

1035
01:21:36,574 --> 01:21:38,975
I should've known
you're just a frustrated

1036
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,376
old cad the
first time I met you.

1037
01:21:40,378 --> 01:21:41,511
Just because
she's a street child

1038
01:21:41,513 --> 01:21:43,413
you think you can do
what you like to her?

1039
01:21:43,415 --> 01:21:45,213
Mind your own business.

1040
01:21:47,685 --> 01:21:49,652
If I see you
with a child again,

1041
01:21:49,654 --> 01:21:51,153
I'll splash your ugly face

1042
01:21:51,155 --> 01:21:54,156
across every newspaper
in Southeast Asia.

1043
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:56,258
I will get you, bitch!

1044
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:57,392
Oh, you don't frighten me.

1045
01:21:57,394 --> 01:22:00,594
I am not a child
that you can frighten.

1046
01:22:12,507 --> 01:22:16,977
Look, those kids up there
are the lucky ones.

1047
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:19,079
They've got a roof
over their heads.

1048
01:22:19,081 --> 01:22:20,547
What if you're a child
living on the streets?

1049
01:22:20,549 --> 01:22:26,452
You're 12 years old and you're looking
after your little sister, she is 6.

1050
01:22:26,454 --> 01:22:29,254
Forget about education
or healthcare,

1051
01:22:29,256 --> 01:22:31,557
forget about protection
from danger

1052
01:22:31,559 --> 01:22:36,027
or a little bit of love
and a cuddle, forget that.

1053
01:22:36,029 --> 01:22:38,429
And now count yourselves
in the thousands,

1054
01:22:38,431 --> 01:22:42,000
living out there in every
derelict building in this city.

1055
01:22:42,002 --> 01:22:45,268
Just like this one here,
except this one is going to be

1056
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:50,241
rebuilt so that you can come
and visit for basic hygiene,

1057
01:22:50,243 --> 01:22:52,176
for medicine, for school,

1058
01:22:52,178 --> 01:22:55,045
and to be treated
like a kid again.

1059
01:22:55,047 --> 01:22:56,179
Because that's the very least

1060
01:22:56,181 --> 01:22:59,016
that you
and your little sister deserve.

1061
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:11,160
So it'll go before
the committee up at head office.

1062
01:23:11,162 --> 01:23:12,595
Now unfortunately, Christina,

1063
01:23:12,597 --> 01:23:16,599
there's a couple of today's
delegates that feel it's...

1064
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:17,767
Feel what?

1065
01:23:17,769 --> 01:23:19,267
That it's just a drop
in the ocean

1066
01:23:19,269 --> 01:23:22,670
in the context of the overall
need in Ho Chi Minh City.

1067
01:23:22,672 --> 01:23:25,106
Now therefore disinclined
to recommend.

1068
01:23:25,108 --> 01:23:27,075
But this is only the beginning.

1069
01:23:27,077 --> 01:23:28,142
This is just the blueprint.

1070
01:23:28,144 --> 01:23:30,144
If we build one center,
we can build ten.

1071
01:23:30,146 --> 01:23:32,546
I'm sorry
not to be more positive.

1072
01:23:32,548 --> 01:23:33,680
Fight for me, Gerry.

1073
01:23:33,682 --> 01:23:35,383
You can bring them around,
I know you can.

1074
01:23:35,385 --> 01:23:41,721
Christina, you don't want
to work for me, do you?

1075
01:23:41,723 --> 01:23:46,226
No, I want you to come
and work for me.

1076
01:25:33,425 --> 01:25:34,425
Is that Carol?

1077
01:25:34,427 --> 01:25:35,527
<i>Speaking.</i>

1078
01:25:35,529 --> 01:25:36,660
It's Christina Noble.

1079
01:25:37,931 --> 01:25:40,398
Yeah, I know that
but if you could just be sure

1080
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,665
to tell Gerry
that I called again.

1081
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:42,900
<i>I will, yes.</i>

1082
01:25:42,902 --> 01:25:46,537
Yeah, and to make the point that it's
been 2 weeks since the delegation visited

1083
01:25:46,539 --> 01:25:48,572
and I was promised a decision
within 10 days.

1084
01:25:48,574 --> 01:25:49,906
<i>I will tell him.</i>

1085
01:25:49,908 --> 01:25:53,843
I'm sorry to be pushy, Carol, but my
government parameter is running out fast.

1086
01:25:53,845 --> 01:25:56,279
<i>I will tell him.</i>

1087
01:26:24,306 --> 01:26:25,940
It'll be okay, Lam.

1088
01:26:47,527 --> 01:26:48,927
Mr. Rat has gone.

1089
01:26:48,929 --> 01:26:51,597
Lam can stay with his mother.

1090
01:26:51,599 --> 01:26:53,865
That's great, Lam.

1091
01:26:54,934 --> 01:26:58,002
You come and see me
sometime, okay?

1092
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,393
Oh, God.

1093
01:27:29,532 --> 01:27:32,534
Mrs. Noble,
we are on the same side.

1094
01:27:32,536 --> 01:27:35,637
I hate this people
as much as you do,

1095
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:37,872
but I need evidence.

1096
01:27:37,874 --> 01:27:38,874
Here. Here's evidence.

1097
01:27:38,876 --> 01:27:41,476
There's a photo of him
on this roll of film.

1098
01:27:41,478 --> 01:27:43,711
I took it the night
that I followed him.

1099
01:27:43,713 --> 01:27:46,714
Illegally? Justifiably.

1100
01:27:47,649 --> 01:27:51,319
So what is the photograph of?

1101
01:27:51,321 --> 01:27:53,553
Him, David Summers.

1102
01:27:57,025 --> 01:28:00,893
Is there a child
with him in the photograph?

1103
01:28:04,332 --> 01:28:05,698
No.

1104
01:28:17,844 --> 01:28:20,845
I need you to do
something for me, Fan.

1105
01:28:20,847 --> 01:28:23,815
You're not going to like it.

1106
01:28:23,817 --> 01:28:25,617
Tell me something new.

1107
01:29:18,367 --> 01:29:22,969
Don't worry, Mama Tina,
I look after them for you.

1108
01:29:22,971 --> 01:29:24,371
I know you will.

1109
01:29:24,373 --> 01:29:27,474
And don't be offering
them cigarettes, all right?

1110
01:29:27,476 --> 01:29:28,641
I promise.

1111
01:29:28,643 --> 01:29:30,043
You promise to come back.

1112
01:29:30,045 --> 01:29:32,011
On my mother's grave.

1113
01:29:32,013 --> 01:29:33,880
And don't bring any husband.

1114
01:29:33,882 --> 01:29:36,482
I would be jealous.

1115
01:29:36,484 --> 01:29:38,784
No husband, I promise.

1116
01:29:38,786 --> 01:29:40,719
It's fucked up.

1117
01:29:52,431 --> 01:29:53,898
Ready?

1118
01:30:09,614 --> 01:30:13,183
I may have to be in London
for a few months, Madame Linh.

1119
01:30:13,185 --> 01:30:15,451
I know I'll have to apply
for another permit.

1120
01:30:15,453 --> 01:30:18,854
I'll...
just have to take my chances.

1121
01:30:18,856 --> 01:30:20,856
And I'm sorry
about the typewriter,

1122
01:30:20,858 --> 01:30:21,757
I will replace it.

1123
01:30:21,759 --> 01:30:25,628
I don't think they will
give you another permit.

1124
01:30:25,630 --> 01:30:31,766
The time has passed
and we achieved very little.

1125
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:33,568
Excuse me, Christina.

1126
01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:36,171
Your car is here
to take you the airport.

1127
01:30:36,173 --> 01:30:38,539
What car?

1128
01:30:38,541 --> 01:30:41,576
I didn't order a car.

1129
01:30:56,690 --> 01:30:57,990
Jump in and close
the door, will you?

1130
01:30:57,992 --> 01:31:01,860
The air conditioning is doing
overtime in this bloody heat.

1131
01:31:06,666 --> 01:31:09,168
Hello, Christina. Gerry.

1132
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:12,137
I hear you're on your way back
to the London.

1133
01:31:12,139 --> 01:31:13,071
You hear right.

1134
01:31:13,073 --> 01:31:15,974
That's a pity.

1135
01:31:15,976 --> 01:31:18,976
That's also a pity that
I've been turned down by

1136
01:31:18,978 --> 01:31:21,479
every oil company in this city.

1137
01:31:21,481 --> 01:31:23,981
Germans, Mexicans, Taiwanese,

1138
01:31:23,983 --> 01:31:27,251
and I've been calling
your office for 2 weeks

1139
01:31:27,253 --> 01:31:28,651
without getting a reply.

1140
01:31:28,653 --> 01:31:30,020
I'm sorry, I've been very busy.

1141
01:31:30,022 --> 01:31:32,056
Yeah, that's what they all say.

1142
01:31:32,058 --> 01:31:36,926
I wouldn't go to the airport
right now if I were you.

1143
01:31:36,928 --> 01:31:37,894
Why not?

1144
01:31:37,896 --> 01:31:39,528
Because our committee
has taken a liking

1145
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:44,633
to your proposal for a
social and medical center.

1146
01:31:46,769 --> 01:31:49,238
Don't...

1147
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:52,241
Don't mess with me, Gerry.

1148
01:31:52,243 --> 01:31:56,044
Twenty thousand dollars
of our liking.

1149
01:32:00,883 --> 01:32:02,250
Are you joking me?

1150
01:32:02,252 --> 01:32:04,252
No.

1151
01:32:04,254 --> 01:32:06,621
Oh, my God.

1152
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:08,856
Congratulations.

1153
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:15,161
I won't let you down.

1154
01:32:15,163 --> 01:32:16,563
I know.

1155
01:32:16,565 --> 01:32:18,832
That is amazing.

1156
01:32:21,736 --> 01:32:22,869
Thank you.

1157
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:24,737
Thank you.

1158
01:32:38,318 --> 01:32:39,718
What the hell are you doing?

1159
01:32:44,123 --> 01:32:45,690
Leave me.

1160
01:32:46,058 --> 01:32:48,292
No. Don't, no.

1161
01:33:01,773 --> 01:33:06,342
Mrs. Noble, you have
already met your destiny.

1162
01:33:06,344 --> 01:33:08,144
You have nothing left to prove.

1163
01:33:08,146 --> 01:33:09,979
You know me a little,
not a lot.

1164
01:33:09,981 --> 01:33:11,113
I have everything
left to prove.

1165
01:33:11,115 --> 01:33:14,749
You must have a stronger focus
if you are to win the battle.

1166
01:33:14,751 --> 01:33:17,152
You forget that
they call us the fighting Irish.

1167
01:33:17,154 --> 01:33:21,356
We, Vietnamese, have faced
more powerful enemies than you.

1168
01:33:21,358 --> 01:33:25,225
Not all, you've never taken
on the nuns, twice.

1169
01:33:25,227 --> 01:33:26,595
We are ready for them.

1170
01:33:26,597 --> 01:33:27,762
That's what you think.

1171
01:33:27,764 --> 01:33:30,364
And are you ready, Mrs. Noble?

1172
01:33:30,366 --> 01:33:32,800
I am, Madame Linh.

1173
01:33:33,268 --> 01:33:37,670
Ready, steady, go.

1174
01:33:51,185 --> 01:33:54,052
