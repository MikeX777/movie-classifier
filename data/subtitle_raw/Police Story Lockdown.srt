1
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,667
Wake up,

2
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:51,792
we're at Bar Street

3
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:56,792
25 RMB

4
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:01,167
You're exhausted and still drinking

5
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:02,834
What a warrior!

6
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,167
Thanks

7
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:07,376
By the way

8
00:03:09,584 --> 00:03:13,751
Want to sleep in my car? I'm in no rush

9
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,792
Where is Wu Bar, please?

10
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:33,542
You're going to Wu Bar?

11
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:34,459
Turn right

12
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:35,501
at the intersection

13
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:41,209
Where are you?

14
00:03:41,626 --> 00:03:42,167
I'm here

15
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:43,917
Why don't I see you?

16
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:46,084
I'm at Bar Street

17
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,042
I warn you, don't be late again

18
00:03:48,084 --> 00:03:49,876
Can't you be nice?

19
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,126
Today's meeting is important

20
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:54,001
Why can't we talk at home?

21
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:57,151
You haven't been home in six months

22
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:24,751
I've booked Room 7.

23
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:26,334
Wait there

24
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:27,751
Ridiculous

25
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,626
Sir, do you have an invitation?

26
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,001
To what?

27
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,247
Our Third Anniversary Party

28
00:04:49,834 --> 00:04:51,042
Must I have one?

29
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:52,876
One moment

30
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:02,292
Welcome, Mr. Zhong

31
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:06,584
You know me?

32
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:07,417
Greetings

33
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,626
Pardon the foreigner's Chinese

34
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:11,292
This way, please

35
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:28,209
Sir, please check your coat there

36
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:30,501
Out of the way! What invitation!

37
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:33,834
Third anniversary. That's why I'm here!
Don't touch me

38
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:34,917
No invitation

39
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,709
Captain Zhong

40
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,126
Do you remember me?

41
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:39,667
I'm TV host Zhu Nan

42
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,501
My partner, Quanzi, interviewed you

43
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:43,542
Are you working on a case here?

44
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,042
Personal stuff

45
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,334
I understand. Police are people, too

46
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:50,042
It's just so hard getting any news

47
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,459
I just interviewed a drunk driver. That scum —

48
00:05:53,292 --> 00:05:54,584
We'll talk later

49
00:05:57,709 --> 00:05:58,709
Where is Room 7?

50
00:05:58,917 --> 00:05:59,334
What?

51
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:00,501
Room 7

52
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:02,826
There's a guy looking for Miao

53
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:04,667
Hang on, Handsome

54
00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:21,959
Life is like a cocktail

55
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,084
to be savored

56
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,376
This drink can be had any way you want

57
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:30,626
This is our Boss, Wu

58
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:32,751
Hello, I'm Wu Jiang

59
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:33,959
Call me Zhong Wen

60
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:35,417
How do you feel here?

61
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:38,126
Like a prison

62
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,542
Yes, once you're in there's no getting out

63
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:43,751
I'm joking. Miao isn't here yet

64
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:47,542
I'll show you around. Come on

65
00:06:59,084 --> 00:07:00,209
This was a factory,

66
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,209
shut down for environmental reasons

67
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:05,357
Guess how long it took to redecorate

68
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,626
Brother Wu

69
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,667
This is Brother Zhong

70
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:09,584
It took me two years

71
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:13,042
The other bars demolished all these pipes

72
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:16,334
Such wonderful stuff. I kept them all

73
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,251
The piranhas were your idea?

74
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,167
They're illegal

75
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:26,792
I don't know the law

76
00:07:27,376 --> 00:07:28,834
In local waters

77
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:31,084
they'd be alien invaders

78
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,551
"Survival of the fittest" is a rule of nature

79
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:35,584
You know Miao well?

80
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,251
She says your business keeps you busy

81
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,542
What a storyteller

82
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:43,709
Freeze!

83
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:50,876
That's my favorite room

84
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:59,709
Have a drink

85
00:08:04,126 --> 00:08:05,709
Let's talk after the clients leave

86
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:11,501
Welcome to Wu Bar's Third Anniversary Party!

87
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:16,667
Room 7 is ahead. Turn right

88
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,834
You didn't tell me about the celebration

89
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:20,042
Zhong, please wait for me inside

90
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:23,667
My bar is full! I lose money by coming here

91
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:26,626
It's been a while. You're prettier now

92
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:27,501
Did you "renovate"?

93
00:08:27,542 --> 00:08:28,876
Don't touch! It'll fall off

94
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:34,667
Which bottle would you like?

95
00:08:35,126 --> 00:08:36,126
I'm not drinking today

96
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:42,667
Please, my boss expects me to sell these

97
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:43,709
Don't trouble him

98
00:08:44,126 --> 00:08:47,001
You'll never change his mind. Put down here

99
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:50,542
Let's start with this

100
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:51,751
Please wait

101
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:06,417
I'm here. No rush

102
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:07,834
What's with the tattoo?

103
00:09:08,292 --> 00:09:11,834
I've got more where you can't see them

104
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,584
You got smarter these six months

105
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,126
But your temper seems better

106
00:09:18,251 --> 00:09:21,084
You told Wu I'm a businessman

107
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:22,959
Should I have said you're a cop?

108
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,709
It's a hard, shameful,

109
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:26,751
low-paying job

110
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,292
Your drink, sir

111
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:34,334
How's your hospital internship?

112
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:36,751
Don't worry about me

113
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:40,417
Did you get that scratch today?

114
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:44,001
Did you disinfect it? How did you get it?

115
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,251
Don't ask

116
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:47,792
You want to tell me

117
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:53,542
Someone reported a case this morning

118
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,751
A cook stabbed someone with meat skewers,

119
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:59,626
got cornered, and threatened suicide

120
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:01,126
Are you jumping or not!

121
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:02,292
Calm down

122
00:10:02,334 --> 00:10:06,001
Three things: One, give me back my stove

123
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:06,542
Fine

124
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:09,209
Two, I'm not paying a fine. Three…

125
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,376
Hurry, it's freezing

126
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:12,584
I'm not going to prison

127
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,084
What are you yelling about?

128
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,251
I didn't yell

129
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:17,292
See, this is minor

130
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:20,126
It's major, a life was at stake

131
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:22,376
Have you jumped before?

132
00:10:23,126 --> 00:10:23,792
It's my first time

133
00:10:24,126 --> 00:10:25,126
How's your aim?

134
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:27,876
Good enough

135
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:29,334
Brother, let's talk

136
00:10:29,376 --> 00:10:32,292
Stop. I'm not talking to you. Go.

137
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:33,542
Who will you talk to?

138
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,376
I'll talk to her. Bring her here

139
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,459
I'll talk to her. You, get out

140
00:10:39,834 --> 00:10:43,167
This went on all day. We were all exhausted

141
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:45,417
I was worried he'd lose it

142
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:47,536
So you started to talk to him

143
00:10:47,876 --> 00:10:48,876
I didn't

144
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:20,292
Let go

145
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:21,334
Stay still

146
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:23,626
Help!

147
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:30,626
He's not hurt. Said he'd treat me to lamb skewers

148
00:11:31,334 --> 00:11:32,959
It's not worth it

149
00:11:33,876 --> 00:11:35,334
to risk your life for strangers

150
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:38,167
What's so important we need to talk here?

151
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:39,917
You'll see

152
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,917
Everyone's a victim of gossip these days

153
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,334
Don't admit anything. Goodbye

154
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:46,501
Hello, Boss Niu

155
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:47,584
I'm Zhu Nan, host of TV's Life Channel

156
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:48,417
I've seen you on TV

157
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,251
May I interview you?

158
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,334
What a mess! You can't film here

159
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,417
He looks familiar

160
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:54,709
He owns a property company, a regular

161
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:57,542
He's rich. Comes for the girls

162
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:59,834
Boss Niu, let me introduce

163
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:01,952
this beauty. Do you know her?

164
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,001
Looks familiar

165
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:04,042
Some flirt

166
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:06,667
Boss Niu

167
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:08,001
She looks so familiar.

168
00:12:12,084 --> 00:12:13,251
It's been a long time

169
00:12:13,501 --> 00:12:14,667
He's my ex

170
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:16,667
How did you meet Boss Wu?

171
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:19,959
He came to the hospital with an old injury

172
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:21,584
What do you think of him?

173
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,334
I don't know, so I shouldn't say

174
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:24,751
Sorry, Brother Zhong

175
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:27,001
There are so many clients I neglected you

176
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,084
Why did you change your look?

177
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:34,376
You know full well

178
00:12:34,751 --> 00:12:35,792
To introduce

179
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:37,417
This is my boyfriend

180
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,751
Now you know why we're meeting here

181
00:12:56,834 --> 00:13:00,001
You two chat, I'll make my rounds

182
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:13,417
I don't like him

183
00:13:17,251 --> 00:13:20,209
I'm telling you, not asking

184
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:21,417
How old is he?

185
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:22,584
It doesn't matter

186
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:24,084
He's almost my age

187
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:25,792
So what?

188
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:29,959
Look at the company he keeps

189
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:31,751
He's stringing you along

190
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:32,917
Why should he?

191
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:34,792
Why should I obey you?

192
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,292
What is it about him? What can he give you?

193
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:42,626
I feel safe

194
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:48,459
I'm a cop, and you feel safe with him?

195
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:50,584
He's got time for me. Do you?

196
00:13:50,834 --> 00:13:53,334
He's my shoulder to cry on. Are you?

197
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:54,459
Some cop

198
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,876
Let me see what the racket is about

199
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:58,626
Stop it

200
00:13:58,667 --> 00:13:59,459
Get out

201
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:01,917
Invitation. See, I have one

202
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,001
Get out

203
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:16,042
I know you've been angry with me

204
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:21,126
I feel like an orphan

205
00:14:21,917 --> 00:14:25,084
Tomorrow marks your mom's death. Don't say that

206
00:14:25,417 --> 00:14:26,626
Don't you talk about her

207
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:30,709
When she was here,

208
00:14:31,626 --> 00:14:33,001
you were never home.

209
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:35,959
I was sick in the winter,

210
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,792
and she carried me to hospital by herself.

211
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,709
I finally got you

212
00:14:42,042 --> 00:14:42,626
Give me back my money

213
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:44,667
You only started to care after she left

214
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:47,584
I don't need you

215
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:52,626
Come out here

216
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:54,792
Excuse me

217
00:14:58,334 --> 00:14:59,334
What are you doing?

218
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,292
How dare you make trouble here?

219
00:15:01,584 --> 00:15:04,001
It's only right to pay what is owed

220
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:06,709
Let the scumbag pay me and I'll go

221
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:08,542
Shut up and get out

222
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:10,876
I want the pay owed to me and my crew

223
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:11,917
You have a death wish

224
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:14,917
Today I do

225
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:17,042
You won't get away now

226
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,917
Take it easy. I'll pay you tomorrow

227
00:15:21,001 --> 00:15:22,626
No, not tomorrow

228
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:26,626
Take some cash, I'll get my men to handle it

229
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,542
Today, I said

230
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,042
This won't work

231
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:34,751
I'll talk to him

232
00:15:35,376 --> 00:15:36,501
Who are you?

233
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:37,876
I'm just having a drink

234
00:15:38,376 --> 00:15:40,042
Please put out the fire first

235
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,501
I thought it's a major incident

236
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:45,709
It is, to me —

237
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:49,792
Turn it off

238
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:52,042
How many years have you been working?

239
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:54,126
I've been a laborer for ten years

240
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,626
Did you know there's a song

241
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:58,167
It was written for me

242
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,251
Turn it off

243
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:03,459
Turn it off

244
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,876
Let's talk openly here

245
00:16:09,876 --> 00:16:12,292
Get the scumbag into the open for once

246
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:13,626
Don't go

247
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:15,876
What are you doing?

248
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:18,501
One last time: will you pay today?

249
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,001
You've seen it all

250
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:21,834
I can't pay you today

251
00:16:22,126 --> 00:16:24,501
You're lying again, scumbag

252
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,376
I can't pay you today

253
00:16:30,126 --> 00:16:31,126
Scumbag

254
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,292
Great move!

255
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,667
My front tooth

256
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,542
This bomb is too amateurish

257
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:47,667
I've called the police

258
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:49,584
Did you film that?

259
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:50,917
I forgot

260
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:54,709
Get the waiters to help. Call an ambulance

261
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,917
Stop! Out of the way!

262
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:07,376
You're fine

263
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:10,584
Where are you going?

264
00:17:11,376 --> 00:17:12,376
To find Wu Jiang

265
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:13,917
Come, sit

266
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:21,459
Captain Zhong,

267
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:23,751
I'll interview you after Boss Niu

268
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:25,166
The show is about to start

269
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:28,292
I must go. My clients are waiting

270
00:17:28,334 --> 00:17:30,251
You think everyone here is weird, right?

271
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,959
Drunks tend to make trouble here

272
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:37,209
All sorts of people show up

273
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:38,459
Welcome

274
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:40,209
Two words: traffic jam

275
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:42,459
You worry too much

276
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:44,001
I hope that's the case

277
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:45,626
You're suspicious of everyone

278
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:50,251
Tonight's show begins now!

279
00:18:37,959 --> 00:18:38,959
Dad

280
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:43,167
Who are you?

281
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,251
Get into the cage! Don't think of getting out

282
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:59,167
There are so many of us. Let's attack them

283
00:19:02,042 --> 00:19:05,792
Did you hear that? The men are going to help!

284
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,542
Inside!

285
00:20:48,292 --> 00:20:50,959
How long had I been out? Wu?

286
00:20:56,751 --> 00:21:00,292
Hours. You must have been exhausted

287
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:01,709
Why did you do this?

288
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:05,167
Ask why the police took so long, instead

289
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:08,126
No one called them

290
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:12,501
Everyone thought, I don't want to be involved

291
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:13,742
Do you know what you're doing?

292
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:20,876
Kidnapping's a felony. At least ten years in jail

293
00:21:23,334 --> 00:21:24,334
Where is my daughter?

294
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:28,876
Miao? Waiting in the hall. She's a good girl

295
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:30,542
Don't talk about her

296
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:34,209
She never said her dad's a cop

297
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:37,917
That makes you a bad dad, and a bad cop

298
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:39,792
Am I your real target?

299
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:45,376
Sir, the police are at the door

300
00:21:47,626 --> 00:21:49,209
Ignore them. Wait downstairs

301
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:54,417
So you called the police

302
00:21:57,126 --> 00:21:59,417
Sorry, I used your phone

303
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:02,501
I answered a call from your lieutenant

304
00:22:02,876 --> 00:22:05,584
I described the situation. He'll be here soon

305
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:11,167
You were military, over 20 accomplished years

306
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:14,667
with local, regional, casework, and SWAT

307
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,251
Penalized once, which you applied for yourself

308
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,709
You've done your homework

309
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,417
Too bad you couldn't handle your family

310
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:24,626
After all these years, your pay is so low

311
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:28,292
A year's pay for a tiny house. Was it worth it?

312
00:22:28,417 --> 00:22:31,917
You don't get it. Some things are priceless

313
00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:38,917
Lieutenant is still on his way

314
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:41,584
No hurry. We'll talk when he arrives.

315
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:50,042
Tell me your demands now

316
00:22:50,084 --> 00:22:51,459
Don't tell me what to do

317
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:54,084
Hostages are hurt. The police won't be patient

318
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:55,126
I'm patient enough

319
00:22:55,584 --> 00:22:56,834
Say what you need to say

320
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,667
Fine. You're my target

321
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:03,501
Guess why?

322
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:09,959
I've made many enemies

323
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:23,334
Last year, car thieves sold their loot nearby

324
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:29,167
We're short-staffed today,
so let's stick to the plan

325
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,834
There's one outside, five inside

326
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,709
The white-haired one is the leader

327
00:23:35,834 --> 00:23:36,834
Do you know White Hair?

328
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:40,542
Yue. Everyone here knows him

329
00:23:43,209 --> 00:23:45,917
Freeze! Police!

330
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:47,709
Stop! Watch them

331
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:53,167
Yue is known to be vicious

332
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:56,376
You'll suffer if you try to
capture him by yourself

333
00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:20,042
Please let me go

334
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,709
I'll capture you myself

335
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:10,626
Just you wait. Your time will come

336
00:25:12,251 --> 00:25:13,501
I'll wait for you

337
00:25:15,751 --> 00:25:16,871
You did this for him, right?

338
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,292
I've heard of those guys

339
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,834
They're ranked too low

340
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:29,251
Most people use threats to boost egos

341
00:25:30,084 --> 00:25:31,126
I agree

342
00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:37,917
Lieutenant, you're here

343
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:43,084
I'm chatting with Capt. Zhong. He's fine

344
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:49,292
I want $80 - 90 million in non-sequential bills

345
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:55,459
Don't threaten me and talk about difficulty

346
00:25:57,584 --> 00:26:00,834
Wu, I don't know what you want

347
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,751
Make a reasonable demand

348
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,334
Lieutenant has a bad temper

349
00:26:06,542 --> 00:26:09,376
Don't get your hopes up. If we can do it, we will

350
00:26:10,126 --> 00:26:11,876
Take it easy on him

351
00:26:12,542 --> 00:26:13,542
You don't want money

352
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,459
Fine, I'll be frank

353
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,584
I want to see someone

354
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:25,334
It's easy for you to find people

355
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,751
But my friend lives far away

356
00:26:29,084 --> 00:26:30,244
I haven't seen him in a while

357
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:35,167
You want to know why? You'll see

358
00:26:53,001 --> 00:26:56,209
Not your call? Why are you wasting my time?

359
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:13,667
Calm down, let's talk it out

360
00:27:15,251 --> 00:27:16,251
Talk it out?

361
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:29,001
You're trying to bluff? Don't bother

362
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:34,792
I forgot you'd been shot

363
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:46,292
I'm curious. What's it like?

364
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,917
It's like taking a vicious hit with a stick

365
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:55,167
I couldn't find my shoulder

366
00:27:57,126 --> 00:27:58,667
or this side

367
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:03,209
Then, this pain that sears through your heart

368
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:06,584
I've felt that searing pain

369
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:08,501
What happened to your leg?

370
00:28:10,251 --> 00:28:11,251
It was long ago

371
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,959
The dark green pickup ahead

372
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:24,167
Pull over

373
00:28:24,542 --> 00:28:26,834
Two suspects are in the truck-

374
00:28:27,084 --> 00:28:29,365
the leader's a cripple.
Should be the one in the back seat

375
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,699
Have you ever kidnapped anyone?

376
00:28:40,876 --> 00:28:42,501
The hostage is in there. Don't shoot

377
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:45,042
Captain Zhong, we're going

378
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:46,792
Stay safe

379
00:29:05,834 --> 00:29:06,834
Take care of them

380
00:29:06,876 --> 00:29:07,292
Don't worry

381
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:08,334
I'll chase them

382
00:29:09,626 --> 00:29:11,501
Call dispatch. We need backup

383
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:25,834
That's a better attitude

384
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:31,209
Are you really bad at small talk, or just acting?

385
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:37,501
Fine. My only demand is to see that person

386
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:40,626
Not "we'll try." It's a "must."

387
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:41,834
Confirm in five minutes

388
00:29:46,542 --> 00:29:48,209
We're in no hurry. Let's chat

389
00:29:57,334 --> 00:29:58,417
How are they?

390
00:29:58,459 --> 00:29:59,917
Chao is fine. Hai broke his arm

391
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:07,834
The backup cars will catch up soon

392
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:33,376
Don't be afraid. I'm a policeman

393
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,376
Be brave. Mr. Policeman will come soon

394
00:30:38,542 --> 00:30:39,542
Stay put

395
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:14,251
Where's the other guy?

396
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:23,626
Too bad we couldn't save the driver

397
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:26,431
The main perpetrator is still on the loose

398
00:31:29,376 --> 00:31:32,084
Not a bad story, but you guessed wrong

399
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:35,126
I despise people who kidnap children

400
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,084
The trip shouldn't take more than three hours

401
00:31:44,167 --> 00:31:46,001
Traffic's smooth at this hour

402
00:31:48,084 --> 00:31:50,876
The hostage? Emotionally stable, pragmatic

403
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:53,959
Sure. I'll be on lookout

404
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:01,167
Taozi, come up. Keep your eyes on him

405
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,792
Calm down. Play some relaxing music

406
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:30,084
Let me have a taste

407
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:34,334
Why? For courage?

408
00:32:36,376 --> 00:32:39,417
Take it easy, this stuff is strong

409
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:39,709
What's going on?

410
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:42,126
What's wrong, Niu?

411
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,042
Heart attack

412
00:33:45,084 --> 00:33:46,084
Is there a doctor here?

413
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:49,042
Do you know how?

414
00:33:49,084 --> 00:33:50,626
Hospital

415
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,001
I'll go with you to the hospital

416
00:33:55,834 --> 00:34:00,751
We must get to a hospital. He can't die

417
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:03,376
Shut up

418
00:34:08,792 --> 00:34:11,459
I'm a doctor. I must go with him to hospital!

419
00:34:11,501 --> 00:34:12,667
Out of the way!

420
00:34:20,376 --> 00:34:23,876
I'm fine. It comes and goes.

421
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:26,542
What a phony!

422
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:19,209
25 YEARS POLICE SERVICE WITH
22 MERITORIOUS AWARDS

423
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,611
HOSTAGE INCIDENT — A KIDNAPPED WOMAN
WAS THREATENED BY KNIFE

424
00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:41,709
Where are they?

425
00:35:43,334 --> 00:35:45,792
Honestly, I'm anxious to see him

426
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:50,084
I warn you, if my friend isn't here

427
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:53,626
All the cops you bring will be useless

428
00:35:55,751 --> 00:35:57,292
Procedure isn't my concern

429
00:36:00,126 --> 00:36:02,584
What, you want to come in? No need

430
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:04,626
I'm a man of my word

431
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:05,042
Wu Jiang

432
00:36:05,084 --> 00:36:06,084
When my guy arrives,

433
00:36:06,126 --> 00:36:06,542
Wu Jiang,

434
00:36:06,584 --> 00:36:07,834
the hostages will be fine

435
00:36:08,334 --> 00:36:09,334
come here

436
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:11,209
Except Captain Zhong

437
00:36:12,792 --> 00:36:13,792
Wu Jiang

438
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:35,209
Listen! You won't get out

439
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:36,959
but you can make other requests

440
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:38,251
Open up

441
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:39,292
What do you want?

442
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:40,834
I need the restroom

443
00:36:46,709 --> 00:36:47,876
Anything else?

444
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,334
Boss Wu, may I interview you?

445
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:51,376
Sure

446
00:36:57,542 --> 00:37:03,167
Get out

447
00:37:27,667 --> 00:37:28,917
Dad, you're here!

448
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:29,709
Are you okay?

449
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:32,626
Sorry, Dad, forgive me

450
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,792
I dressed up like that to upset you

451
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:38,084
I didn't show I cared. You're much prettier now

452
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:43,001
Put this away for me

453
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:46,209
Be careful, Dad

454
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:47,834
Where can I get a phone?

455
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:51,167
They took all our phones

456
00:37:52,209 --> 00:37:53,584
They're on the table in the hall

457
00:37:54,876 --> 00:37:55,876
But…

458
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,417
Hurry up!

459
00:38:11,626 --> 00:38:13,126
I'm Zhu Nan, host of the Life Channel

460
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:15,167
I risked my life for this Exclusive

461
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,917
at a kidnapping

462
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:19,042
Here's the mastermind behind this case

463
00:38:19,376 --> 00:38:20,584
Can I say that?

464
00:38:21,126 --> 00:38:23,709
You must have a great story,

465
00:38:23,751 --> 00:38:25,417
Boss Wu. Say hello

466
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:27,792
Hands off. I want a drink. So what?

467
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:32,917
Let's continue

468
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:35,751
Do you feel that

469
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:38,917
I'm insane for doing this?

470
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:42,209
No. Why are you committing this crime?

471
00:38:42,917 --> 00:38:48,542
I just did what no one else dares

472
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:54,251
Let me go

473
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,126
I'm not done with the interview. Look —

474
00:39:05,334 --> 00:39:06,501
Are you done?

475
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:12,876
You were nice to me to get my dad here

476
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,126
If you must say that

477
00:39:15,584 --> 00:39:16,751
You're using me

478
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:20,959
I'm not a good guy,

479
00:39:21,376 --> 00:39:23,084
your dad's not a good cop.

480
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:27,459
Neither of us

481
00:39:28,001 --> 00:39:29,001
can make you feel safe.

482
00:39:46,709 --> 00:39:49,334
This is Zhong Wen. I stole a cell phone

483
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:50,126
Are you safe now?

484
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:51,501
I'm fine. I'm hiding

485
00:39:51,626 --> 00:39:52,917
What's going on?

486
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:55,417
There are over a dozen hostages

487
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:58,042
There were four suspects. I got rid of one

488
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:00,042
The boss, Wu, is the leader.

489
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:01,709
He has a knockoff 64

490
00:40:01,751 --> 00:40:03,292
What are his demands?

491
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:05,084
He wants to see a prison detainee

492
00:40:05,209 --> 00:40:06,209
What's the name?

493
00:40:06,334 --> 00:40:07,376
Wei Xiaofu

494
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:08,751
Wei Xiaofu

495
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:14,751
Chief has agreed and is making arrangements

496
00:40:14,876 --> 00:40:18,959
We've made a plan with snipers and SWAT

497
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,917
Are conditions suited for a SWAT assault?

498
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:23,417
The bar is two stories tall. The hostages are

499
00:40:24,084 --> 00:40:28,167
in a cage, watched by the three suspects

500
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:30,376
If we attack now

501
00:41:02,667 --> 00:41:05,334
It'll be too dangerous for the hostages

502
00:41:06,167 --> 00:41:09,459
They may have other weapons

503
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:11,167
Understood

504
00:41:11,251 --> 00:41:13,834
We may attack at any time

505
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:17,417
Boss, that guy escaped

506
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:18,334
I have to go

507
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:20,126
Find him! Useless fool

508
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:57,334
He's here

509
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:04,459
Is that all you've got?

510
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:06,792
I bet you still can't handle him

511
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:24,292
Brother Zhong, you're amazing

512
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,376
But aren't you worried about your daughter?

513
00:43:30,209 --> 00:43:33,792
Miao said, you used to be her hero

514
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:37,126
How'd you become a deserter?

515
00:43:38,126 --> 00:43:39,584
Let's talk

516
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:42,626
In your own words, let's talk openly

517
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:43,959
Dad, don't worry about me

518
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:48,959
I wanted her in my "law of the jungle" experiment

519
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,084
Don't come out, Dad

520
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:52,751
Sure, you must think in your dark corner

521
00:43:53,626 --> 00:43:56,417
but fingertips

522
00:43:57,959 --> 00:43:59,042
don't grow back

523
00:44:00,084 --> 00:44:01,084
Stop

524
00:44:08,084 --> 00:44:09,251
Dad, don't come

525
00:44:16,501 --> 00:44:17,501
Don't come

526
00:44:20,292 --> 00:44:22,792
Let her go. Target me

527
00:44:28,084 --> 00:44:31,834
Now you're like a good father, but it's too late

528
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:33,501
Stop

529
00:44:47,417 --> 00:44:48,417
I'm fine

530
00:44:59,292 --> 00:45:02,417
Give him room. So, you're here on a case

531
00:45:02,459 --> 00:45:05,126
Where were you? Were we in any danger?

532
00:45:05,917 --> 00:45:08,709
Lady! Stop saying stupid things

533
00:45:09,626 --> 00:45:10,501
What did I say?

534
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,792
You don't stop talking! So annoying!

535
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:15,417
With this scoop, she'll be promoted tomorrow

536
00:45:16,126 --> 00:45:17,292
None of your business

537
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:22,001
I'm fine

538
00:45:22,584 --> 00:45:25,084
Let me go. Do you think I can escape?

539
00:45:25,126 --> 00:45:27,001
I'm sure you will. You'll be fine

540
00:45:29,501 --> 00:45:33,917
From my experience, he'll release us soon

541
00:45:34,126 --> 00:45:36,292
In all kidnappings —

542
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:40,001
They'd be killing the hostages now

543
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:41,792
It's usually about money

544
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:43,334
I know Wu well. He's rich.

545
00:45:43,709 --> 00:45:45,959
It's more than that

546
00:45:46,001 --> 00:45:47,041
Is there a back door here?

547
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:49,667
- There's just this door
- Boss designed the bar.

548
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:51,667
He sealed the back door

549
00:45:51,709 --> 00:45:53,209
What does your father do?

550
00:45:55,292 --> 00:45:56,292
He's a policeman

551
00:45:56,917 --> 00:46:00,501
Such hatred, beating him so badly.
Must be over a girl

552
00:46:01,084 --> 00:46:03,209
Don't worry. We don't know him

553
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:04,334
I know you

554
00:46:07,167 --> 00:46:08,501
The drug store

555
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,084
The thief- he stole from me

556
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:13,417
That's right

557
00:46:13,459 --> 00:46:15,417
I didn't recognize you without your uniform

558
00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:16,792
She was there that day, too

559
00:46:16,834 --> 00:46:18,917
That's Lan, now a manager at the nightclub

560
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,334
And the famous Boss Niu.

561
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:23,292
We were all there

562
00:46:24,709 --> 00:46:26,126
Something happened inside

563
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:27,807
Captain Zhong is in there. What happened?

564
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:30,917
We're together again. That's destiny

565
00:46:30,959 --> 00:46:32,376
Cut the nonsense

566
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,626
Comrade Policeman, what's your issue with Wu?

567
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,542
Talk it out with him. Why involve us?

568
00:46:38,584 --> 00:46:39,584
Destiny, my foot

569
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:45,084
Chief Zhang, a high official

570
00:46:45,917 --> 00:46:49,167
I'm so honored. They're all fine

571
00:46:50,584 --> 00:46:52,001
You want to see them, right?

572
00:46:54,542 --> 00:46:57,834
Look. They're lively and well-fed

573
00:46:58,042 --> 00:47:01,292
I am Police Chief Zhang Guomin. Don't worry

574
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:04,001
I'll do my best to help you

575
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:06,334
Go ahead, Boss Wu. We'll wait

576
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:10,834
Film this area and the people

577
00:47:11,001 --> 00:47:13,001
My friend isn't here. You're unreliable

578
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:15,751
Give us more time. Several reasons —

579
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:18,084
I don't care. You have five minutes

580
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:21,334
Show some respect. Five more minutes

581
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:25,292
If he's not here in ten minutes, I'll get violent

582
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:28,042
Please come, Boss Wu

583
00:47:33,376 --> 00:47:34,376
I want to talk to you

584
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:35,501
Go ahead

585
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,167
Alone

586
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:40,959
Our usual place

587
00:47:45,209 --> 00:47:48,084
Zhong, what more is there to say?

588
00:47:49,501 --> 00:47:51,251
You just want us.

589
00:47:51,792 --> 00:47:53,917
Why involve innocents?

590
00:47:54,501 --> 00:47:56,001
I need more chips

591
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:58,542
And how do you know they're innocent?

592
00:48:00,126 --> 00:48:01,126
What do want to say?

593
00:48:02,084 --> 00:48:03,876
You created an elaborate plot

594
00:48:04,001 --> 00:48:05,001
Yes

595
00:48:05,334 --> 00:48:06,792
But you can't win with your way

596
00:48:07,001 --> 00:48:08,042
We'll see

597
00:48:08,334 --> 00:48:09,959
You need a middleman.

598
00:48:10,292 --> 00:48:12,417
I can help

599
00:48:12,459 --> 00:48:13,939
A cop helping a criminal. What a joke

600
00:48:14,084 --> 00:48:16,501
What do you want to know from that case?

601
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:17,376
I don't want to discuss that now

602
00:48:17,417 --> 00:48:18,792
Then we'll wait for Wei Xiaofu

603
00:48:18,834 --> 00:48:21,126
You ask lots of questions. My turn

604
00:48:22,584 --> 00:48:25,584
You cops don't see much of this, do you?

605
00:48:29,209 --> 00:48:30,334
We see all kinds

606
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:32,584
How many cases have you been on?

607
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:35,126
Lots. Over 100 a year

608
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:37,001
How many cops die in a year?

609
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:41,667
About 400 die in the line of duty in China

610
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:45,209
And how many hostages?

611
00:48:47,542 --> 00:48:48,626
Accidents happen

612
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:51,667
Will there be an accident today?

613
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:00,459
I don't want casualties today

614
00:49:00,751 --> 00:49:01,751
Including me?

615
00:49:02,126 --> 00:49:04,667
Yes. Every life is precious

616
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:06,876
I stopped believing that long ago

617
00:49:07,584 --> 00:49:09,376
Although you've done your homework

618
00:49:09,626 --> 00:49:12,626
Zhong, you sneaked into my secret chamber

619
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:16,126
So you know some of my secrets

620
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:19,667
You can see this is beyond negotiation

621
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:22,084
So we have nothing to talk about

622
00:49:25,709 --> 00:49:27,251
I see you're a boxer

623
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:33,542
I've got some time. Let me tell you a story

624
00:49:34,209 --> 00:49:36,209
You asked what happened to my leg

625
00:49:38,542 --> 00:49:40,709
As a boy, I went overseas with my father

626
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:47,542
He killed himself due to gambling debts.
I had to repay them

627
00:49:49,126 --> 00:49:51,417
The only skill I had there

628
00:49:52,251 --> 00:49:54,167
was fighting

629
00:50:01,626 --> 00:50:03,001
I had always fought

630
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,876
on others' behalf

631
00:50:07,876 --> 00:50:10,376
Fighting over who's more vicious

632
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:12,376
I never had a worthy opponent

633
00:50:32,501 --> 00:50:34,251
You risk your life for money

634
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:38,292
but life is so worthless and fleeting

635
00:50:39,834 --> 00:50:42,709
I swore to stop once I repaid the debts

636
00:50:43,126 --> 00:50:46,709
So during that time I was like a crazy man

637
00:50:58,376 --> 00:51:00,126
I finally repaid all the debts

638
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:01,981
but I didn't want to do anything else

639
00:51:02,084 --> 00:51:04,001
It was all about

640
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:06,709
money, life and death

641
00:51:08,084 --> 00:51:09,792
So I continued

642
00:51:12,084 --> 00:51:14,501
You may be killed by your opponent at any time

643
00:51:14,917 --> 00:51:18,584
My nickname was Spider. I never lost,

644
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:22,001
but a spider is an insignificant bug

645
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,584
Illegal boxers are the same

646
00:51:23,626 --> 00:51:26,084
I knew your men from boxing

647
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:30,167
The foreigners were the best in their countries

648
00:51:30,417 --> 00:51:33,459
The shorter one, Pichon, is a regular champion

649
00:51:39,959 --> 00:51:42,001
Everyone wanted us to fight

650
00:51:43,126 --> 00:51:45,084
I know it's inevitable

651
00:51:47,417 --> 00:51:51,751
Before the fight, I felt the bets were too big

652
00:51:52,001 --> 00:51:55,001
The better fighter you are, the more you're worth

653
00:51:55,959 --> 00:51:58,626
and the closer to death you are

654
00:51:59,959 --> 00:52:02,126
What happened at that fight?

655
00:52:04,084 --> 00:52:06,626
In the beginning we were even

656
00:52:07,126 --> 00:52:08,751
Then he got the upper hand

657
00:52:10,876 --> 00:52:12,626
Next round, he'll let you win

658
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:15,792
The two bosses arranged everything

659
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:22,417
I found out just before the final round

660
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:25,251
It was a fight to the death

661
00:52:25,459 --> 00:52:27,626
Next round, kill him

662
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:31,167
Boss didn't know my heart was soft that day

663
00:52:32,209 --> 00:52:36,084
I'd decided to return to China after that fight

664
00:52:36,542 --> 00:52:39,209
and bring some fighters to help me

665
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:44,584
Poor Pichon

666
00:52:44,959 --> 00:52:46,417
only knew he was to lose

667
00:52:48,376 --> 00:52:50,126
I told him he had been fixed to die

668
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:02,501
Disobeying the boss meant death

669
00:53:02,792 --> 00:53:06,334
So several of us escaped and hid for a time

670
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:09,626
We're lucky to be here, alive

671
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:11,126
Why did you suddenly go soft?

672
00:53:12,001 --> 00:53:14,126
As you say, you don't get it

673
00:53:15,584 --> 00:53:16,917
You've lived quite a life

674
00:53:17,542 --> 00:53:20,417
But one can't treat another's life lightly

675
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:22,584
Everyone has the right to live

676
00:53:22,626 --> 00:53:25,251
To live well

677
00:53:37,917 --> 00:53:39,459
You know why I'm still alive?

678
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:43,209
You came back to China five years ago

679
00:53:43,417 --> 00:53:45,001
just for the drugstore robbery

680
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:46,167
For the truth

681
00:53:46,209 --> 00:53:48,959
The world is full of lies

682
00:53:49,001 --> 00:53:51,459
Is this the only way to find the truth?

683
00:53:54,084 --> 00:53:57,042
I should say, it's my way

684
00:54:01,709 --> 00:54:04,751
Don't sit

685
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,001
Don't sit

686
00:54:36,042 --> 00:54:41,084
Amazing! You almost succeeded

687
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:45,542
This bulletproof glass is worth every penny

688
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:49,751
It's a police rescue effort, you'd do the same

689
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:53,792
Your plan was good, snipers and SWAT together

690
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:55,792
but I'm no amateur thief

691
00:55:07,709 --> 00:55:09,084
Why didn't you let me sit?

692
00:55:10,126 --> 00:55:11,126
I wanted to save you

693
00:55:11,626 --> 00:55:13,084
You want to help me and save me

694
00:55:15,126 --> 00:55:16,376
He's on screen

695
00:55:17,459 --> 00:55:20,917
- There were gunshots
- Chief Zhang, I'm still alive

696
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:22,876
Your Captain Zhong? He also lives

697
00:55:23,584 --> 00:55:26,209
Cut the nonsense. Let me see Wei Xiaofu

698
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:29,167
Why did you get me here so late at night?

699
00:55:29,792 --> 00:55:31,709
Get him in here to see me

700
00:55:32,084 --> 00:55:35,042
You're kidding! I don't want to go in

701
00:55:35,126 --> 00:55:38,542
It's against the rules to bring a prisoner here

702
00:55:39,084 --> 00:55:41,584
Please know we must guarantee his safety

703
00:55:41,709 --> 00:55:43,459
You're tricking me

704
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:48,542
You must see Wei Xiaofu, right?

705
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:51,209
Let me break it down for you

706
00:55:51,501 --> 00:55:54,667
You're armed, took hostages and are at a stalemate

707
00:55:55,042 --> 00:55:56,417
I can kill some hostages

708
00:55:56,501 --> 00:56:00,084
And I'll make sure you'll never see Wei

709
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:03,667
The police will find another way to attack

710
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:05,167
What are you saying?

711
00:56:05,209 --> 00:56:08,376
Only I can help you to see him

712
00:56:08,751 --> 00:56:11,042
He trusts me. I can try to bring him in

713
00:56:11,709 --> 00:56:14,417
I'll talk to him, and you free the hostages.

714
00:56:16,042 --> 00:56:17,042
Think on it

715
00:56:22,667 --> 00:56:25,334
Life is like a cocktail

716
00:56:26,084 --> 00:56:28,084
What might the next sip taste like?

717
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:31,459
I've filmed everything you told me to

718
00:56:32,292 --> 00:56:33,292
Trust my skills

719
00:56:43,584 --> 00:56:44,792
And if you don't come back?

720
00:56:45,084 --> 00:56:46,751
Trust me, I will

721
00:56:46,876 --> 00:56:48,501
But you must guarantee Wei's safety

722
00:56:48,792 --> 00:56:51,501
You dare to trust my guarantee?

723
00:56:52,251 --> 00:56:53,334
Trust is mutual

724
00:56:54,917 --> 00:56:57,417
Take two people. Your daughter stays

725
00:56:59,084 --> 00:57:00,459
I said, all the hostages

726
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,126
Impossible. I must keep some

727
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:08,084
I know which ones. Let the rest go

728
00:57:08,917 --> 00:57:09,917
No

729
00:57:11,251 --> 00:57:12,251
No deal

730
00:57:13,959 --> 00:57:14,626
Three

731
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,417
No deal

732
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:16,821
You can only bring three hostages

733
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:22,876
Put down your gun

734
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:33,542
You two have hot tempers

735
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:36,042
Here. You two fight.

736
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:45,001
You win, I promise you can bring people out

737
00:57:45,292 --> 00:57:48,042
You lose, go alone

738
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:51,959
Dad, you're hurt

739
00:57:52,126 --> 00:57:53,459
You can't defeat him. Don't fight

740
00:57:53,501 --> 00:57:56,084
You're not young anymore

741
00:57:56,459 --> 00:57:58,376
It's embarrassing to lose. Never mind

742
00:57:59,751 --> 00:58:03,084
Why? Fight! You're a cop!

743
00:58:03,126 --> 00:58:04,251
Good prevails over evil

744
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:05,292
Take us out

745
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:06,626
Fine

746
00:58:07,751 --> 00:58:08,751
Agreed

747
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:18,584
Comrade Police, it's all on you! Go, go!

748
00:58:18,626 --> 00:58:19,959
Be careful, Dad

749
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:28,084
In a few seconds, you won't be able to get up

750
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:46,626
This fight is too hard

751
00:58:47,376 --> 00:58:50,917
We can't benefit from his loss. Pray for him

752
00:58:54,417 --> 00:58:57,251
Captain Zhong, there's no shame in giving up

753
00:59:18,751 --> 00:59:20,834
Stop playing the hero, Dad

754
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:24,417
Zhong, give up if you can't handle it

755
01:00:02,834 --> 01:00:06,542
Dad, stop! You can't beat them

756
01:00:10,959 --> 01:00:15,542
Get up, Cop

757
01:00:16,084 --> 01:00:17,084
Go, Mr. Policeman!

758
01:00:22,501 --> 01:00:23,501
Beat him

759
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:45,459
How suspenseful

760
01:00:50,834 --> 01:00:52,376
He is good

761
01:01:06,334 --> 01:01:07,709
Stop, Dad

762
01:02:05,751 --> 01:02:08,792
Stay down or you'll die

763
01:02:11,876 --> 01:02:13,959
Stop fighting

764
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:16,542
We don't want to go out anymore

765
01:02:19,792 --> 01:02:23,292
Cop, we're moved. You tried your best

766
01:02:23,334 --> 01:02:26,459
Mr. Policeman, we don't want to go anymore

767
01:02:27,084 --> 01:02:28,334
Stop, don't get up

768
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:34,292
Please stop fighting, I'm begging you

769
01:02:53,167 --> 01:02:55,417
Don't let go! Hang on tight!

770
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:03,042
He can't last! Harder!

771
01:03:04,376 --> 01:03:05,376
Careful, Cop

772
01:03:07,001 --> 01:03:09,334
Cop, let go! Watch out

773
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:34,834
Let go. You won

774
01:03:38,542 --> 01:03:40,292
You won

775
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:55,667
Give me your scarf

776
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:01,042
Don't lock up again! Aren't we all going?

777
01:04:07,042 --> 01:04:07,626
Here's an idea

778
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:10,001
I'll take my daughter out first

779
01:04:12,542 --> 01:04:15,042
When Wei Xiaofu comes in, she may go

780
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,251
I'm not going anywhere

781
01:04:16,459 --> 01:04:18,917
I'm staying with my dad till the end

782
01:04:20,709 --> 01:04:21,709
Don't regret it

783
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:26,751
As agreed, I'll give you the man you want

784
01:04:27,209 --> 01:04:28,667
Bring three people with you first

785
01:04:28,834 --> 01:04:30,626
Why change now? This is too much

786
01:04:30,709 --> 01:04:33,209
It's leverage in case you don't come back

787
01:04:33,542 --> 01:04:37,334
I'll release them just before Wei comes in

788
01:04:38,042 --> 01:04:40,334
That's not a change. Choose the hostages

789
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:47,501
Wu, I really can't go on.

790
01:04:47,667 --> 01:04:48,876
I'll forfeit the money

791
01:04:49,001 --> 01:04:51,542
My health is poor. May I be one of them?

792
01:04:51,626 --> 01:04:55,126
Wu, if you think I'm useful to you I'll stay

793
01:04:56,042 --> 01:04:57,709
I'll go out to film, okay?

794
01:05:01,167 --> 01:05:03,042
Have you decided?

795
01:05:03,501 --> 01:05:05,001
The two injured hostages,

796
01:05:07,001 --> 01:05:08,084
and him

797
01:05:12,251 --> 01:05:13,251
You

798
01:05:13,876 --> 01:05:15,709
Me? Just me?

799
01:05:18,209 --> 01:05:20,251
No, I'm staying with my girlfriend

800
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,084
Only you dared make a move.

801
01:05:22,334 --> 01:05:25,126
We need more men like you

802
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:27,334
I'll make an exception. Go together

803
01:05:29,042 --> 01:05:30,209
Hurry

804
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:37,334
You're a casualty: you lost a tooth

805
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:39,626
Just me?

806
01:05:40,834 --> 01:05:42,126
We're inseparable

807
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:46,167
I owe him money, I need to pay him outside

808
01:05:46,626 --> 01:05:48,917
You'd have enough to pay if you'd drink less

809
01:05:54,376 --> 01:05:56,417
Captain Zhong, you must return

810
01:05:56,459 --> 01:05:57,459
Zhong,

811
01:05:59,084 --> 01:06:01,376
You have ten minutes. I'm very punctual

812
01:06:13,876 --> 01:06:16,417
Hostages are coming! We need a stretcher

813
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:21,376
There are four more

814
01:06:24,751 --> 01:06:26,709
This is a suspect- cuff him

815
01:06:32,251 --> 01:06:34,042
You saved my life

816
01:06:34,084 --> 01:06:35,709
Cheers for the Policeman!

817
01:06:35,751 --> 01:06:37,459
There are more people back here

818
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:46,084
Are you badly hurt

819
01:06:46,126 --> 01:06:47,126
I'm okay. It's minor,

820
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:48,792
Chief Zhang

821
01:06:49,417 --> 01:06:50,417
Check out these suspects

822
01:06:51,084 --> 01:06:52,244
Three suspects and three guns

823
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:53,376
Where are they located?

824
01:06:53,417 --> 01:06:55,542
In the main hall, with 16 hostages

825
01:06:55,667 --> 01:06:56,834
Physical conditions of the hostages?

826
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:57,459
All right

827
01:06:57,501 --> 01:06:59,101
But they can't last much longer mentally

828
01:07:01,084 --> 01:07:02,084
Lieutenant

829
01:07:02,876 --> 01:07:05,501
I felt you took action too soon just now

830
01:07:07,251 --> 01:07:09,917
Captain Zhong, the suspect wants to talk to you

831
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:14,876
I'll tell you everything I know

832
01:07:14,959 --> 01:07:15,751
Speak

833
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:16,959
I did this for money

834
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,014
I never imagined he'd make such a big deal

835
01:07:20,626 --> 01:07:23,626
Please don't go in. You'll never get back out

836
01:07:23,834 --> 01:07:26,292
They told me they

837
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:29,001
don't expect to get out alive

838
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:30,292
That's all I know

839
01:07:30,376 --> 01:07:32,209
Thank you, sir

840
01:07:39,917 --> 01:07:42,501
These are from the building's management

841
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:43,999
We have eight more minutes

842
01:07:44,542 --> 01:07:47,126
It differs from the blueprint-

843
01:07:47,251 --> 01:07:48,167
the windows are sealed

844
01:07:48,209 --> 01:07:49,917
This door

845
01:07:50,042 --> 01:07:51,917
is made with 25cm-thick steel panels

846
01:07:52,126 --> 01:07:53,584
The walls are 50cm thick

847
01:07:53,626 --> 01:07:55,334
There was a back door but it's been sealed

848
01:07:55,376 --> 01:07:56,542
He's from building management

849
01:07:57,042 --> 01:07:58,792
How could you allow all these changes?

850
01:07:58,917 --> 01:08:00,917
It's private property, out of our jurisdiction

851
01:08:00,959 --> 01:08:02,751
Fine. I'll call if I need you

852
01:08:02,876 --> 01:08:06,251
He's really built himself a fortress

853
01:08:06,501 --> 01:08:07,251
Over here?

854
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:11,084
You can go in from the roof here and be hidden

855
01:08:11,126 --> 01:08:12,126
Seven more minutes

856
01:08:14,417 --> 01:08:17,209
This is a homemade bomb with a timer

857
01:08:17,251 --> 01:08:21,667
The wiring is complex, with multiple detonators

858
01:08:21,751 --> 01:08:23,126
He means to blow up everyone, including himself

859
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,001
There are so many hostages

860
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:29,292
The best way to save them
is for me to bring Wei in

861
01:08:29,459 --> 01:08:30,626
Trading two people for 12.

862
01:08:31,667 --> 01:08:32,667
Has he agreed to go in?

863
01:08:44,126 --> 01:08:46,334
I was on the phone with my mother

864
01:08:46,459 --> 01:08:49,084
She wants me to behave, to try for early release

865
01:08:51,126 --> 01:08:52,417
Please help us

866
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:55,167
It's too risky

867
01:08:56,001 --> 01:08:57,542
Your safety is a concern

868
01:08:57,792 --> 01:09:00,501
It may be dangerous, but we'll try our best

869
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:04,626
Help us. We'll apply to reduce your sentence

870
01:09:07,167 --> 01:09:09,959
I still feel unsafe. Forget it

871
01:09:12,251 --> 01:09:13,876
We can't force you to take a risk like this

872
01:09:13,917 --> 01:09:16,334
Thanks for taking care of my mom all these years

873
01:09:18,292 --> 01:09:19,751
I promised years ago that I would

874
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:22,251
Everyone on our team donated to your family

875
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:23,709
I'm touched

876
01:09:24,334 --> 01:09:27,167
Here's the information on the suspects

877
01:09:27,334 --> 01:09:28,542
Bin, a Thai

878
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:30,042
Pichon, a Filipino

879
01:09:30,126 --> 01:09:34,042
Wu Jiang returned five years ago, as a Thai

880
01:09:34,084 --> 01:09:36,667
The victim Mei's parents were divorced

881
01:09:36,917 --> 01:09:37,751
The mother died,

882
01:09:37,792 --> 01:09:41,417
a brother went overseas with the father

883
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:44,459
I think Wu Jiang is Mei's brother

884
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:48,001
He's not asking for Wei Xiaofu's release

885
01:09:48,042 --> 01:09:50,209
Three of the hostages were witnesses back then

886
01:09:50,626 --> 01:09:53,126
I think he wants to know what happened

887
01:09:53,501 --> 01:09:56,501
Cops, criminals, witnesses: all here

888
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:58,417
It's been five years

889
01:09:58,501 --> 01:09:59,751
You have four more minutes

890
01:10:02,792 --> 01:10:03,792
Let's talk method

891
01:10:03,959 --> 01:10:07,584
We'll dress as Zhong and Wei. SWAT stands by

892
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:09,417
First, cut open the roof by laser

893
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:12,876
The door opens, we attack from above and below

894
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,211
It's hard to attack through the crack in the door

895
01:10:15,376 --> 01:10:16,656
This way, we get their attention

896
01:10:17,334 --> 01:10:21,584
Roof-cutting time varies.
We'll endanger the hostages

897
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:23,209
Hostage safety comes first

898
01:10:23,251 --> 01:10:23,834
Let me negotiate again

899
01:10:23,876 --> 01:10:25,751
You can't-

900
01:10:25,792 --> 01:10:28,709
lives are at stake. Talk is useless

901
01:10:28,751 --> 01:10:30,667
This is too major.

902
01:10:30,709 --> 01:10:32,667
It calls for a hard-core assault

903
01:10:32,876 --> 01:10:33,917
Assaults are most risky now

904
01:10:33,959 --> 01:10:35,876
And you're not taking a risk by going back in?

905
01:10:35,959 --> 01:10:38,126
Keeping my promise will build trust.

906
01:10:38,167 --> 01:10:39,292
There's still a chance to talk

907
01:10:39,334 --> 01:10:41,876
You've been talking for six hours

908
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:43,459
Some negotiations last months, you know

909
01:10:43,501 --> 01:10:44,167
No

910
01:10:44,209 --> 01:10:46,376
We got injured hostages out with talking

911
01:10:46,417 --> 01:10:48,459
Lieutenant was looking out for you

912
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:50,501
Trading two for 12, good deal

913
01:10:50,542 --> 01:10:54,334
See? As Lieutenant, I should go in,

914
01:10:54,376 --> 01:10:55,417
not you

915
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:58,167
It's my case, the same one as five years ago

916
01:10:58,209 --> 01:10:59,501
I'm most suited to go in

917
01:11:10,417 --> 01:11:13,626
Besides, my daughter's inside

918
01:11:14,959 --> 01:11:18,667
Shouldn't he stay away for that reason?

919
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:20,917
Stop arguing

920
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:24,167
Zhong should go back in

921
01:11:24,209 --> 01:11:26,251
But get a substitute for Wei

922
01:11:26,792 --> 01:11:28,501
Wu will know

923
01:11:29,709 --> 01:11:31,001
at a glance

924
01:11:31,334 --> 01:11:33,334
Chief Zhang, please come here

925
01:11:37,542 --> 01:11:39,584
Repeat what I say. "Three more minutes."

926
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:40,626
The thug says —

927
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:41,667
What?

928
01:11:41,792 --> 01:11:43,792
Boss Wu says, three more minutes

929
01:11:43,834 --> 01:11:44,876
"If he doesn't come, you will die"

930
01:11:44,959 --> 01:11:46,292
"If he doesn't come,

931
01:11:47,959 --> 01:11:49,084
I will die"

932
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:50,251
"No joke"

933
01:11:50,292 --> 01:11:53,792
"No joke." He's really not joking, please help!

934
01:11:55,626 --> 01:11:56,706
Less than three minutes now

935
01:11:57,709 --> 01:12:00,126
Chief Zhang, Wei Xiaofu has agreed to go in

936
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:01,959
Reason?

937
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:03,001
One, to repay our favor

938
01:12:03,376 --> 01:12:05,376
Two, he doesn't want to be evil

939
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:07,042
He's a real man

940
01:12:09,751 --> 01:12:12,251
Make a small opening to save time. Go!

941
01:12:12,334 --> 01:12:13,501
Yes, sir! Run

942
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:15,334
Bomb Squad, give Wei a suit

943
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:17,876
The Lieutenant is in charge.

944
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:19,792
It's on you

945
01:12:22,709 --> 01:12:25,376
Guoqiang, this is your sniper operation

946
01:12:25,417 --> 01:12:25,834
Yes, sir

947
01:12:25,876 --> 01:12:28,917
As you say, your own safety is key

948
01:12:28,959 --> 01:12:30,292
The sniper needs to set up.

949
01:12:30,917 --> 01:12:32,917
Talk and buy more time

950
01:12:33,334 --> 01:12:35,459
On my orders. It's already loaded

951
01:12:41,584 --> 01:12:44,167
Don't be angry.

952
01:12:44,959 --> 01:12:46,376
I didn't want you to bear this alone

953
01:12:46,417 --> 01:12:49,251
If possible, let me talk a bit more

954
01:12:49,584 --> 01:12:52,709
If I can control the scene,
don't let the sniper shoot

955
01:12:53,251 --> 01:12:54,417
You win

956
01:13:19,501 --> 01:13:20,792
You can still smile?

957
01:13:21,167 --> 01:13:22,792
These clothes are safe and warm

958
01:13:22,834 --> 01:13:24,209
But it weighs over 35kgs

959
01:13:24,751 --> 01:13:26,001
Does this count as a merit?

960
01:13:28,584 --> 01:13:31,792
I might get a reduced sentence for this?

961
01:13:31,876 --> 01:13:35,167
I can still care for my mom in this lifetime

962
01:13:37,001 --> 01:13:38,376
The roof-cutting team is in place

963
01:13:42,834 --> 01:13:43,959
Hurry

964
01:13:45,209 --> 01:13:47,751
Say something, Captain Zhong

965
01:13:48,126 --> 01:13:50,334
Are you being brave for your daughter?

966
01:13:50,376 --> 01:13:51,417
How is it your daughter's here?

967
01:13:51,459 --> 01:13:53,167
If she wasn't here, would you be going back in?

968
01:13:53,209 --> 01:13:55,167
What's wrong with her?

969
01:13:55,209 --> 01:13:57,667
When the hostages come out we'll go in

970
01:14:04,626 --> 01:14:06,106
Once we go in, will we get out alive?

971
01:14:07,292 --> 01:14:09,584
I promise to keep you alive as long as I live

972
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:12,001
What if you die first?

973
01:14:15,876 --> 01:14:17,751
Just kidding. I'm a nervous wreck

974
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:21,501
Once inside, stay next to me and don't move

975
01:14:22,001 --> 01:14:22,667
May I speak?

976
01:14:22,709 --> 01:14:24,417
Speak the truth, not nonsense

977
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:26,751
What did you stuff into my clothes just now?

978
01:14:26,792 --> 01:14:28,042
That's nonsense

979
01:14:42,292 --> 01:14:43,292
Arms

980
01:14:52,251 --> 01:14:57,709
You should get a job at Airport Security

981
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:00,042
Again, bullshit

982
01:15:01,376 --> 01:15:02,376
Go

983
01:15:31,334 --> 01:15:32,876
Police

984
01:15:33,501 --> 01:15:36,876
Police! Hurry, help! What's going on?

985
01:15:36,917 --> 01:15:38,751
Talk, don't hit.

986
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,584
We're in positions of power

987
01:15:40,626 --> 01:15:41,167
These sons of bitches

988
01:15:41,209 --> 01:15:42,209
Where's my daughter?

989
01:15:42,459 --> 01:15:44,209
Dad, I'm here

990
01:15:44,834 --> 01:15:45,959
I'm fine.

991
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,042
You take care

992
01:15:48,292 --> 01:15:51,001
Help! Police! I'm afraid of heights

993
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:54,584
Your outfit is awesome. Can you get us out?

994
01:15:54,626 --> 01:15:55,876
What is all this?

995
01:15:55,917 --> 01:15:58,001
What's tied around our necks?

996
01:15:59,126 --> 01:16:00,834
Can you tell me what's going on?

997
01:16:01,209 --> 01:16:03,167
It looks like a bomb. Is it real?

998
01:16:15,542 --> 01:16:16,542
It's real

999
01:16:27,126 --> 01:16:29,709
We're missing one person

1000
01:16:30,501 --> 01:16:32,626
Maybe there's a still a hostage inside

1001
01:16:32,876 --> 01:16:34,792
Good job, Captain Zhong

1002
01:16:35,084 --> 01:16:36,042
You really brought him in here

1003
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:39,251
I'm a man of my word.
I want to evacuate the hostages

1004
01:16:39,792 --> 01:16:42,001
Your crimes are not serious

1005
01:16:42,334 --> 01:16:44,209
We can explain everything away

1006
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:48,001
I can prove you stopped voluntarily

1007
01:16:48,042 --> 01:16:50,542
You can't help me. It's my time now

1008
01:16:50,917 --> 01:16:51,959
18 more minutes

1009
01:16:55,417 --> 01:16:58,667
What's he wearing? What a ridiculous getup

1010
01:16:58,917 --> 01:17:00,001
We must do our best to protect him

1011
01:17:00,084 --> 01:17:01,604
This is my turf. You can't protect him

1012
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:02,751
You guaranteed his safety

1013
01:17:03,292 --> 01:17:04,501
His temporary safety

1014
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:06,667
In this getup, I don't recognize him

1015
01:17:07,376 --> 01:17:08,626
Remove his helmet

1016
01:17:12,667 --> 01:17:13,751
Helmet off

1017
01:17:14,251 --> 01:17:15,251
Stay back

1018
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:23,209
Stay back

1019
01:17:23,251 --> 01:17:25,834
Don't play this game with me.

1020
01:17:25,959 --> 01:17:27,334
They despise me

1021
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,709
I'm not afraid. He thinks I'll cause evil

1022
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,376
Stay back

1023
01:17:31,417 --> 01:17:33,376
I don't want to wear this

1024
01:17:35,834 --> 01:17:39,126
It's stuffy. I'm dizzy

1025
01:17:39,459 --> 01:17:41,584
I'm not afraid.

1026
01:17:41,917 --> 01:17:42,917
Wei Xiaofu

1027
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:44,747
Isn't that what's-his-name?

1028
01:17:45,126 --> 01:17:46,126
How come it's him?

1029
01:17:46,834 --> 01:17:47,834
Put on your helmet

1030
01:17:48,167 --> 01:17:49,917
Relax, Captain Zhong. I'll be with you now

1031
01:17:50,126 --> 01:17:51,606
The police forced you to come, right?

1032
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,417
You're wrong. I came willingly

1033
01:17:54,459 --> 01:17:56,376
You've rounded everyone up.

1034
01:17:57,084 --> 01:17:58,792
The truth will come out

1035
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:01,042
I've been waiting for this day

1036
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:14,376
Big brother, when will you be back?

1037
01:18:22,292 --> 01:18:24,042
Everyone knows this girl, right?

1038
01:18:25,292 --> 01:18:26,542
Now you know

1039
01:18:28,126 --> 01:18:29,209
she's my baby sister

1040
01:18:30,001 --> 01:18:33,542
We were separated. I found her five years ago

1041
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:36,334
She's the meaning of my life

1042
01:18:37,792 --> 01:18:38,792
I came back,

1043
01:18:40,001 --> 01:18:41,209
but didn't see her

1044
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:44,876
I finally found a way to meet with you

1045
01:18:45,876 --> 01:18:47,667
I don't know what happened

1046
01:18:48,334 --> 01:18:49,417
five years ago

1047
01:18:49,876 --> 01:18:51,417
But you were all there.

1048
01:18:52,251 --> 01:18:53,876
Let's talk

1049
01:18:55,126 --> 01:18:57,792
It's been so long. What if I can't remember?

1050
01:18:59,667 --> 01:19:02,334
The bomb is remote-controlled.
It may help you think

1051
01:19:02,376 --> 01:19:04,251
Let me think. I should remember

1052
01:19:05,459 --> 01:19:06,542
Let's begin

1053
01:19:07,334 --> 01:19:09,334
When we're done I can go back out, right?

1054
01:19:09,459 --> 01:19:10,709
Someone won't make it out today

1055
01:19:10,834 --> 01:19:13,001
Then what can I do to make sure I will?

1056
01:19:13,459 --> 01:19:16,126
Don't mess with me, but that's hard for you

1057
01:19:16,501 --> 01:19:18,667
Say your piece. Hurry

1058
01:19:19,126 --> 01:19:20,501
Who should speak first?

1059
01:19:21,792 --> 01:19:23,334
Cutting the roof takes time

1060
01:19:23,834 --> 01:19:27,001
The team is worried about disturbing those below

1061
01:19:27,792 --> 01:19:30,876
You're right. My first idea won't work

1062
01:19:31,251 --> 01:19:32,251
Just play for time

1063
01:19:32,584 --> 01:19:34,376
Let me start

1064
01:19:34,417 --> 01:19:36,251
Wait, Zhong

1065
01:19:36,292 --> 01:19:38,459
Remove your communication devices

1066
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:39,709
so I won't have to

1067
01:19:40,251 --> 01:19:42,709
We're trying other ways to get in

1068
01:19:43,584 --> 01:19:45,292
We can launch the assault in 15 minutes

1069
01:19:46,084 --> 01:19:48,376
Till then, you're in charge of the inside

1070
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,626
Wei Xiaofu, you start

1071
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:07,542
It all started with me

1072
01:20:09,834 --> 01:20:12,542
That night, almost at this time

1073
01:20:13,376 --> 01:20:16,126
A few customers were at the drugstore. I went in

1074
01:20:26,792 --> 01:20:29,167
I want to do something for my mom

1075
01:20:30,001 --> 01:20:31,167
She's in poor health.

1076
01:20:32,042 --> 01:20:34,542
But I can't afford tonics

1077
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:37,501
My mistake was being too nosy

1078
01:20:37,542 --> 01:20:38,542
I'll give you 20 extra

1079
01:20:44,459 --> 01:20:46,334
I wanted to ask whose wallet that was

1080
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:47,709
No way-

1081
01:20:48,126 --> 01:20:49,751
who're you trying to kid?

1082
01:20:49,834 --> 01:20:51,376
You were drunk, what do you know?

1083
01:20:52,209 --> 01:20:55,542
I was drinking, but my mind was clear

1084
01:21:03,292 --> 01:21:04,334
Hand it over

1085
01:21:05,959 --> 01:21:06,959
What is this?

1086
01:21:07,376 --> 01:21:08,417
I just picked it up from the floor

1087
01:21:08,459 --> 01:21:09,042
You stole it

1088
01:21:09,084 --> 01:21:10,084
I just picked it up

1089
01:21:10,251 --> 01:21:11,251
Do you know who I am?

1090
01:21:11,501 --> 01:21:13,251
You dare to steal my stuff? Go to hell

1091
01:21:13,292 --> 01:21:14,626
I really did pick it up

1092
01:21:14,667 --> 01:21:15,667
Wait.

1093
01:21:16,501 --> 01:21:17,501
Don't move.

1094
01:21:18,084 --> 01:21:19,084
And then?

1095
01:21:19,126 --> 01:21:21,376
Then…

1096
01:21:21,834 --> 01:21:22,667
Quickly

1097
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:24,584
I'm clearest on what happened next

1098
01:21:24,626 --> 01:21:25,334
Go to hell!

1099
01:21:25,376 --> 01:21:26,917
I really picked it up

1100
01:21:26,959 --> 01:21:27,959
Wait.

1101
01:21:29,959 --> 01:21:30,959
Don't move

1102
01:21:32,126 --> 01:21:34,751
This is mine. Did you pick it up, too?

1103
01:21:34,917 --> 01:21:35,917
Does he have any more?

1104
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:38,626
Two boxes

1105
01:21:38,751 --> 01:21:42,167
I'm a man of principles. I convince with reason

1106
01:21:42,209 --> 01:21:43,542
Were you being reasonable?

1107
01:21:43,584 --> 01:21:45,417
I call it as I see it

1108
01:21:45,459 --> 01:21:47,001
That's called hitting me when I'm down

1109
01:21:47,334 --> 01:21:48,334
What?

1110
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:52,542
I remember every word you said that night

1111
01:21:52,792 --> 01:21:53,917
This box costs tens of thousands

1112
01:21:54,001 --> 01:21:55,917
You have good taste

1113
01:21:55,959 --> 01:21:58,001
Shall we handle it ourselves

1114
01:21:58,042 --> 01:22:00,917
or call the police?

1115
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,376
Handle it or call police

1116
01:22:05,001 --> 01:22:08,584
You can't tell? He's poor

1117
01:22:08,792 --> 01:22:09,292
Call the police

1118
01:22:09,542 --> 01:22:11,501
Sure. I'll call them now

1119
01:22:11,542 --> 01:22:12,542
Don't call the police

1120
01:22:14,042 --> 01:22:16,292
I was afraid it'd turn into a big deal

1121
01:22:16,459 --> 01:22:18,751
That's how it became a big deal

1122
01:22:18,792 --> 01:22:20,876
Who dares to call the police? Don't!

1123
01:22:20,917 --> 01:22:22,209
Stop, if you want to live

1124
01:22:23,001 --> 01:22:24,501
What do you mean? What do you want?

1125
01:22:24,876 --> 01:22:27,001
Give it to me

1126
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:28,209
Give it over. Now

1127
01:22:28,709 --> 01:22:29,709
Hello, Police?

1128
01:22:32,542 --> 01:22:34,751
Thinking back I really was confused

1129
01:22:34,834 --> 01:22:37,209
I should have run. They wouldn't have stopped me

1130
01:22:38,501 --> 01:22:39,501
But I —

1131
01:22:42,126 --> 01:22:42,876
Give me the phone

1132
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,292
We're being robbed!

1133
01:22:44,667 --> 01:22:46,459
The drug store by Gu Lou

1134
01:22:47,376 --> 01:22:48,667
Give it to me! Let go!

1135
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:51,834
When my sister was thrown to the ground

1136
01:22:54,751 --> 01:22:58,042
You just watched

1137
01:23:03,042 --> 01:23:06,876
He was closest, and he ran.
What could I have done?

1138
01:23:07,251 --> 01:23:10,292
Of course I wanted to approach, but they left

1139
01:23:10,417 --> 01:23:12,376
I'm not experienced with one-on-one

1140
01:23:12,417 --> 01:23:16,334
I wasn't scared, but he dragged me away

1141
01:23:16,959 --> 01:23:17,751
And then?

1142
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:19,292
I'll tell the story for you

1143
01:23:23,251 --> 01:23:26,376
I was off-duty and passed by

1144
01:23:28,709 --> 01:23:32,417
Comrade Police, something's happening there

1145
01:23:35,376 --> 01:23:37,626
Don't move. Stay away

1146
01:23:37,667 --> 01:23:39,584
He stole something. She called the police

1147
01:23:39,667 --> 01:23:41,376
The thief, he —

1148
01:23:41,667 --> 01:23:42,334
Step out

1149
01:23:42,626 --> 01:23:44,292
Stop. Don't come over

1150
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:46,334
Call dispatch, notify local police

1151
01:23:46,376 --> 01:23:47,167
I was thinking then —

1152
01:23:47,209 --> 01:23:48,376
I'll tell it for you

1153
01:23:48,584 --> 01:23:50,334
The criminals may kill the hostages

1154
01:23:50,376 --> 01:23:51,751
Don't move! Back off

1155
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:53,209
Captain Zhong has the power to —

1156
01:23:53,251 --> 01:23:54,209
One more step and I'll kill her

1157
01:23:54,459 --> 01:23:55,792
- easily and decisively kill you

1158
01:23:59,042 --> 01:23:59,876
You're being ridiculous

1159
01:23:59,917 --> 01:24:02,501
If that were true, it wouldn't be a problem

1160
01:24:02,792 --> 01:24:04,667
All life is precious.

1161
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:06,209
Without understanding —

1162
01:24:06,501 --> 01:24:08,001
Captain Zhong is used to talking it out

1163
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:09,402
There's no rush. Let's talk it out

1164
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:11,167
But Zhong was distracted.

1165
01:24:12,042 --> 01:24:13,251
His wife was

1166
01:24:14,459 --> 01:24:17,792
run over by a car

1167
01:24:18,042 --> 01:24:19,501
and being treated in hospital

1168
01:24:19,876 --> 01:24:22,584
The hospital and his daughter kept calling him

1169
01:24:24,792 --> 01:24:25,251
I get it

1170
01:24:25,292 --> 01:24:26,167
Why are you on the phone?

1171
01:24:26,209 --> 01:24:27,251
I'll be right there

1172
01:24:27,292 --> 01:24:27,709
Hang up

1173
01:24:27,751 --> 01:24:29,876
Wei Xiaofu gets out of control

1174
01:24:30,459 --> 01:24:32,792
Are you tricking me? What do you want?

1175
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:34,126
Do you think I'm bluffing?

1176
01:24:34,876 --> 01:24:37,917
And the rest is history

1177
01:24:37,959 --> 01:24:38,584
LIVE

1178
01:24:38,626 --> 01:24:41,126
Captain Zhong, tell us what's going on inside

1179
01:24:42,126 --> 01:24:44,084
You tell great stories.

1180
01:24:44,209 --> 01:24:45,126
How can you be sure?

1181
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:47,334
Were you there? How do you know everything?

1182
01:24:47,792 --> 01:24:48,959
Are you done speaking?

1183
01:24:50,334 --> 01:24:51,334
It's my turn

1184
01:24:51,917 --> 01:24:55,501
Miao will tell you, but she doesn't know much

1185
01:24:56,834 --> 01:24:58,667
That night, my wife was running a high fever

1186
01:24:59,126 --> 01:25:01,751
I was working and couldn't take her to hospital

1187
01:25:02,209 --> 01:25:03,667
She forbidden her to go

1188
01:25:03,709 --> 01:25:06,042
She took a cab alone, and the accident happened

1189
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:08,167
I ignored my phone,

1190
01:25:08,542 --> 01:25:10,251
but felt something was wrong

1191
01:25:10,459 --> 01:25:12,209
I felt rushed that day

1192
01:25:12,626 --> 01:25:14,106
Captain Zhong was so patient that day

1193
01:25:14,292 --> 01:25:16,084
Take your time, we'll talk everything out

1194
01:25:16,667 --> 01:25:19,667
When I called back I found out what happened

1195
01:25:20,209 --> 01:25:22,084
By the time I rushed to the hospital

1196
01:25:22,667 --> 01:25:23,667
it was too late

1197
01:25:26,751 --> 01:25:29,792
I wanted to explain to my daughter, but

1198
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:32,126
she wouldn't listen or forgive me

1199
01:25:35,709 --> 01:25:37,876
I tried to convince him to stop

1200
01:25:40,626 --> 01:25:42,334
I took the drugs for my mom

1201
01:25:42,667 --> 01:25:46,459
Let's clarify everything and do what must be done

1202
01:25:46,542 --> 01:25:48,251
Let the girl go.

1203
01:25:48,292 --> 01:25:50,584
It would be bad if she got hurt

1204
01:25:51,001 --> 01:25:53,042
We'll think of a way to help your mother

1205
01:25:53,251 --> 01:25:54,292
Will that do?

1206
01:25:54,959 --> 01:25:56,501
So can't you let me go?

1207
01:25:57,459 --> 01:25:58,251
Please!

1208
01:25:58,334 --> 01:25:59,709
Wei was agitated.

1209
01:26:00,459 --> 01:26:02,876
Your sister was quite calm

1210
01:26:03,251 --> 01:26:05,751
I didn't know what to do. Suddenly —

1211
01:26:06,084 --> 01:26:07,917
Accidents always happen suddenly

1212
01:26:08,626 --> 01:26:10,376
Fine. Let me continue

1213
01:26:11,584 --> 01:26:16,751
It was chaos outside. Your sister said, softly,

1214
01:26:17,209 --> 01:26:18,292
"Kill me."

1215
01:26:18,584 --> 01:26:19,459
What did she say?

1216
01:26:19,584 --> 01:26:22,667
She spoke very softly. I thought I'd misheard

1217
01:26:23,667 --> 01:26:24,667
What did you say?

1218
01:26:25,584 --> 01:26:26,584
You heard it, too

1219
01:26:26,792 --> 01:26:28,334
I heard her cry out, once

1220
01:26:29,292 --> 01:26:30,959
That was her second cry

1221
01:26:31,001 --> 01:26:32,001
What did you say?

1222
01:26:32,126 --> 01:26:33,376
"Kill me"

1223
01:26:33,417 --> 01:26:35,001
What are you doing?

1224
01:26:36,001 --> 01:26:37,959
It wasn't me, I didn't move

1225
01:26:40,001 --> 01:26:41,376
Ambulance

1226
01:26:52,626 --> 01:26:56,167
She injured her carotid artery and bled to death

1227
01:26:56,751 --> 01:26:58,334
This is the truth you wanted

1228
01:26:59,959 --> 01:27:04,209
So, my sister killed herself

1229
01:27:04,251 --> 01:27:07,876
Of course. I used my knife as a bluff

1230
01:27:07,917 --> 01:27:10,084
I never guessed she'd grab it,

1231
01:27:10,417 --> 01:27:11,126
it scared me

1232
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:12,751
Why should I believe you?

1233
01:27:13,001 --> 01:27:14,001
I believe him

1234
01:27:14,626 --> 01:27:15,751
You weren't even there

1235
01:27:16,209 --> 01:27:18,501
She was troubled.

1236
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:20,167
See what drug she bought

1237
01:27:20,459 --> 01:27:21,459
What drug?

1238
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:24,001
What drug did she buy?

1239
01:27:25,709 --> 01:27:29,626
Manager, I'm afraid you must tell us

1240
01:27:32,209 --> 01:27:33,209
What are you doing?

1241
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:35,292
Testing for leaks

1242
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:37,084
You're paying for this

1243
01:27:40,251 --> 01:27:41,626
Sleeping pills

1244
01:27:41,792 --> 01:27:42,792
Prescription?

1245
01:27:43,042 --> 01:27:44,042
100 pills

1246
01:27:44,542 --> 01:27:46,876
By law, it's sold by prescription only

1247
01:27:47,292 --> 01:27:49,126
I'm a man of principle

1248
01:27:49,542 --> 01:27:50,542
And then?

1249
01:27:51,834 --> 01:27:53,126
I'll take over from here

1250
01:27:55,667 --> 01:27:58,417
The law is dead. People are alive

1251
01:27:58,709 --> 01:28:00,626
A warning:

1252
01:28:01,292 --> 01:28:02,667
to pull a bluff, just take a few

1253
01:28:02,709 --> 01:28:03,292
Can I buy them or not?

1254
01:28:03,542 --> 01:28:04,876
Sure,

1255
01:28:06,292 --> 01:28:07,459
but it doesn't cost this much

1256
01:28:07,501 --> 01:28:08,941
I'll give you a few more pills, then

1257
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:11,501
Coming! One moment, please

1258
01:28:12,042 --> 01:28:12,751
Are you done?

1259
01:28:12,834 --> 01:28:13,834
Yes

1260
01:28:14,667 --> 01:28:16,584
Continue-

1261
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:18,126
What? They're all the same

1262
01:28:19,626 --> 01:28:20,709
You broke up?

1263
01:28:21,042 --> 01:28:22,959
It's always that

1264
01:28:24,167 --> 01:28:27,292
I've taken them before. It's horrible

1265
01:28:27,334 --> 01:28:30,167
I had my stomach pumped. Vomited like mad

1266
01:28:30,209 --> 01:28:31,542
What else did you say?

1267
01:28:31,667 --> 01:28:32,667
Nothing

1268
01:28:33,209 --> 01:28:34,959
You're no angel.

1269
01:28:35,001 --> 01:28:37,084
I remember what you said next

1270
01:28:37,126 --> 01:28:38,917
What true love?

1271
01:28:39,001 --> 01:28:40,667
I don't trust anyone any more

1272
01:28:41,667 --> 01:28:43,626
There are so many men

1273
01:28:43,876 --> 01:28:45,196
We're not the same kind of people

1274
01:28:46,626 --> 01:28:48,334
What do you mean?

1275
01:28:48,417 --> 01:28:50,209
Playing innocent

1276
01:28:50,584 --> 01:28:52,709
You're so blind!

1277
01:28:53,251 --> 01:28:54,042
Just go and die

1278
01:28:54,084 --> 01:28:55,417
When did I say all that?

1279
01:28:55,542 --> 01:28:56,376
You said it

1280
01:28:56,417 --> 01:28:58,126
Wu, I never did.

1281
01:28:58,376 --> 01:29:00,001
I tried to talk her out of it

1282
01:29:00,042 --> 01:29:02,251
Your sister died because of what she said

1283
01:29:02,292 --> 01:29:05,042
You sold her the drug knowing she was depressed

1284
01:29:05,084 --> 01:29:06,251
I can prove he sold her the drug

1285
01:29:06,292 --> 01:29:07,251
They're working together

1286
01:29:07,292 --> 01:29:08,376
Shut up!

1287
01:29:10,876 --> 01:29:11,917
Calm down.

1288
01:29:11,959 --> 01:29:14,709
They did find sleeping pills on her

1289
01:29:14,792 --> 01:29:17,251
Does buying sleeping pills equal suicide?

1290
01:29:17,292 --> 01:29:20,376
Extreme agitation may cause dire actions

1291
01:29:20,417 --> 01:29:21,584
I know why

1292
01:29:22,334 --> 01:29:23,042
Watch what you say

1293
01:29:23,084 --> 01:29:25,209
Half of female suicides are for a man

1294
01:29:25,459 --> 01:29:26,876
The other half are for several men

1295
01:29:27,626 --> 01:29:28,084
Boss Wu

1296
01:29:28,126 --> 01:29:30,251
I say so because I've done it

1297
01:29:30,292 --> 01:29:33,584
I realize now it's not worth it, but many don't

1298
01:29:33,751 --> 01:29:35,001
Listen to me

1299
01:29:35,501 --> 01:29:37,876
I completely understand how you feel

1300
01:29:38,959 --> 01:29:42,251
It's hard to live alone abroad for so many years

1301
01:29:42,709 --> 01:29:46,626
Your sister was your only family,
the light of your life

1302
01:29:47,501 --> 01:29:51,251
She died, so you came here to investigate

1303
01:29:51,667 --> 01:29:54,334
or take it out on someone. That's natural

1304
01:29:55,209 --> 01:29:56,667
Go on. You have five more minutes

1305
01:29:58,001 --> 01:29:59,417
You planned this

1306
01:29:59,792 --> 01:30:03,001
to punish her killer, right?

1307
01:30:03,376 --> 01:30:06,042
Regardless of method,

1308
01:30:06,167 --> 01:30:08,542
you have the wrong target

1309
01:30:08,834 --> 01:30:10,209
You mean, you're all innocent

1310
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:13,542
What Lan said makes sense

1311
01:30:13,667 --> 01:30:14,667
Explain yourself

1312
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:16,792
There's something you should know

1313
01:30:19,042 --> 01:30:20,667
Your sister was pregnant at the time

1314
01:30:27,251 --> 01:30:30,126
She sees you as a parent

1315
01:30:30,417 --> 01:30:32,542
she must have told you

1316
01:30:32,626 --> 01:30:33,709
Stop

1317
01:30:33,751 --> 01:30:37,292
When the M.E. discovered her pregnancy,
we investigated

1318
01:30:37,542 --> 01:30:38,709
She had no marriage record,

1319
01:30:39,292 --> 01:30:41,876
and the father never came

1320
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:44,376
See? Men are not worth it!

1321
01:30:45,167 --> 01:30:47,709
No one here is who you're looking for

1322
01:30:47,751 --> 01:30:50,167
Even if you find him, it could become a story

1323
01:30:50,209 --> 01:30:51,667
You're trying to confuse me

1324
01:30:51,709 --> 01:30:53,376
I want to clear your mind

1325
01:30:53,459 --> 01:30:55,376
Even so, you're out of time

1326
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:57,584
Look, you've made it like a trial today

1327
01:30:57,626 --> 01:30:58,876
Each one of you is guilty

1328
01:30:58,917 --> 01:30:59,834
The law has already —

1329
01:30:59,876 --> 01:31:03,167
You just watched as my sister died?

1330
01:31:03,209 --> 01:31:04,209
You, a cop,

1331
01:31:04,251 --> 01:31:05,709
I admit I made mistakes

1332
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:08,084
It was your knife.

1333
01:31:08,417 --> 01:31:10,251
Does ten years in jail pay for her life?

1334
01:31:10,292 --> 01:31:11,751
What do you want from me?

1335
01:31:13,751 --> 01:31:16,709
Niu, Lan, you stood by while she died.

1336
01:31:16,751 --> 01:31:18,042
You're killers

1337
01:31:19,126 --> 01:31:20,292
What did I do?

1338
01:31:20,334 --> 01:31:22,876
No one minds others' business any more

1339
01:31:22,917 --> 01:31:25,917
At least let me know why I have to die

1340
01:31:25,959 --> 01:31:27,459
I helped her. I tried to talk her out of it

1341
01:31:27,501 --> 01:31:30,209
She didn't trust anyone. It's not my fault

1342
01:31:31,292 --> 01:31:32,417
Manager

1343
01:31:32,501 --> 01:31:33,459
Put on your helmet

1344
01:31:33,501 --> 01:31:35,876
For a small profit, you let my sister die

1345
01:31:35,959 --> 01:31:37,459
I'm not the only one.

1346
01:31:37,917 --> 01:31:39,917
And she didn't die from the drugs

1347
01:31:45,126 --> 01:31:46,209
No one shoots!

1348
01:31:46,834 --> 01:31:48,751
Tell them to put down their guns

1349
01:31:48,792 --> 01:31:49,792
Don't force me to shoot

1350
01:31:50,834 --> 01:31:52,292
Stop, Wu.

1351
01:31:53,042 --> 01:31:54,709
You can still live if you surrender now

1352
01:31:55,501 --> 01:31:56,251
No shooting

1353
01:31:56,292 --> 01:31:58,501
Fine. Stop shouting or I'll shoot you

1354
01:32:00,792 --> 01:32:01,667
This is a great outfit

1355
01:32:01,709 --> 01:32:02,834
Drop your guns.

1356
01:32:03,376 --> 01:32:04,876
Behind you, Dad

1357
01:32:07,167 --> 01:32:09,834
Life's like a cocktail-

1358
01:32:10,376 --> 01:32:11,959
Gotta drink it to know

1359
01:32:12,626 --> 01:32:14,626
if it was bitter or sweet

1360
01:32:17,334 --> 01:32:18,459
You're hard to handle

1361
01:32:21,917 --> 01:32:24,209
Meet Kun,

1362
01:32:24,251 --> 01:32:26,167
bartender and bomb maker

1363
01:32:26,209 --> 01:32:27,251
My leg

1364
01:32:29,834 --> 01:32:30,834
What do you want?

1365
01:32:32,709 --> 01:32:35,501
Don't worry. This is fake.

1366
01:32:35,751 --> 01:32:37,459
The real ones come later

1367
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:40,251
- None of you can hide from them
- Please! Spare us!

1368
01:32:40,501 --> 01:32:43,667
Why didn't you just kill me?

1369
01:32:44,917 --> 01:32:46,084
Glad you understand.

1370
01:32:47,126 --> 01:32:49,001
I'm saving you

1371
01:32:49,292 --> 01:32:51,126
But it's over

1372
01:32:54,917 --> 01:32:55,917
Not yet

1373
01:32:58,084 --> 01:32:59,917
You're my sister's boyfriend, right?

1374
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:04,457
What kind of joke is this?

1375
01:33:05,001 --> 01:33:08,167
I found half a picture among her things

1376
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:10,751
I remember your tattoo

1377
01:33:11,167 --> 01:33:12,626
You've changed it,

1378
01:33:13,417 --> 01:33:14,667
but I still know it

1379
01:33:16,542 --> 01:33:17,542
Really?

1380
01:33:21,042 --> 01:33:22,042
Really?

1381
01:33:25,959 --> 01:33:28,834
Since Zhong has said so, I'll tell you

1382
01:33:30,292 --> 01:33:31,292
Yes,

1383
01:33:32,334 --> 01:33:33,042
I am he

1384
01:33:33,334 --> 01:33:36,542
Interesting. I thought you escaped long ago

1385
01:33:36,584 --> 01:33:40,042
Yet you work and make bombs for me

1386
01:33:40,251 --> 01:33:42,834
Why are you pointing your gun at me?

1387
01:33:43,542 --> 01:33:45,751
I want to see how you avenge Mei's death

1388
01:33:46,167 --> 01:33:50,209
Good for you. We're really all here

1389
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:53,042
I was a coward then

1390
01:33:53,542 --> 01:33:54,902
But now I know I'll be last to go,

1391
01:33:55,251 --> 01:33:58,042
I fear nothing

1392
01:33:58,126 --> 01:34:00,042
Talk fast. You have two minutes to live

1393
01:34:00,792 --> 01:34:04,167
Wu, you had a part in her death, too

1394
01:34:05,209 --> 01:34:06,209
What?

1395
01:34:06,667 --> 01:34:09,584
She told me

1396
01:34:10,167 --> 01:34:11,501
you didn't want her to be with me

1397
01:34:12,042 --> 01:34:13,162
But I genuinely fell in love

1398
01:34:13,792 --> 01:34:14,959
with her

1399
01:34:15,417 --> 01:34:17,626
She got pregnant and told you

1400
01:34:18,001 --> 01:34:20,834
But you said you'd come to kill me.

1401
01:34:21,292 --> 01:34:22,834
She was so hurt

1402
01:34:23,376 --> 01:34:26,042
There was no hope for me,

1403
01:34:26,292 --> 01:34:27,834
so I broke up with her

1404
01:34:30,376 --> 01:34:32,501
That night, we had a big fight

1405
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:33,959
She stormed out, crying.

1406
01:34:34,751 --> 01:34:35,751
I ran after her

1407
01:34:36,626 --> 01:34:39,751
Even that last time we looked at each other

1408
01:34:40,001 --> 01:34:42,667
we never knew how fragile life would be

1409
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:44,959
I lived for revenge.

1410
01:34:46,667 --> 01:34:50,001
Now I know how much she hated me

1411
01:34:52,209 --> 01:34:55,126
What one didn't treasure, one may not salvage

1412
01:34:55,334 --> 01:34:56,834
Right, Wu?

1413
01:35:01,917 --> 01:35:03,917
Come on, you've got the gun

1414
01:35:04,459 --> 01:35:05,459
Wu

1415
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:08,209
I wronged her the most

1416
01:35:10,459 --> 01:35:11,709
I most deserve to die

1417
01:35:49,334 --> 01:35:52,542
Get down

1418
01:37:52,334 --> 01:37:55,626
Miao!

1419
01:37:56,001 --> 01:37:58,542
Dad, I'm here

1420
01:38:00,376 --> 01:38:01,792
Dad I'm here

1421
01:38:02,959 --> 01:38:04,417
You missed the first train

1422
01:38:04,459 --> 01:38:07,417
I could have gotten on, but there's no point

1423
01:38:07,459 --> 01:38:08,709
You destroyed my plan

1424
01:38:08,751 --> 01:38:10,459
Your plan? Why must you harm my daughter?

1425
01:38:10,876 --> 01:38:12,792
Everyone's lives are worthless except Mei's

1426
01:38:13,167 --> 01:38:15,334
No one has the right to
take others' lives in anger

1427
01:38:16,251 --> 01:38:17,251
Stay away

1428
01:38:18,417 --> 01:38:19,834
My sister didn't deserve to die

1429
01:38:20,209 --> 01:38:21,489
So you have to hurt more people?

1430
01:38:21,917 --> 01:38:23,876
If she were alive, would she want this?

1431
01:38:23,917 --> 01:38:25,792
But she's dead.

1432
01:38:26,292 --> 01:38:27,417
She's not coming back

1433
01:38:27,459 --> 01:38:29,019
Then you should treasure life even more

1434
01:38:29,251 --> 01:38:30,251
Dad

1435
01:38:31,209 --> 01:38:33,667
Let my daughter go

1436
01:38:34,334 --> 01:38:37,584
This is the same scene as five years ago

1437
01:38:38,209 --> 01:38:41,667
Shoot. You get a merit. I get to die.

1438
01:38:42,126 --> 01:38:43,334
Win-win

1439
01:38:43,751 --> 01:38:46,084
Of course, there may be accidents

1440
01:38:46,126 --> 01:38:48,167
I beg you, let my daughter go

1441
01:38:48,376 --> 01:38:52,126
If I do, will it be over?

1442
01:38:54,959 --> 01:38:57,334
You must pay for your actions

1443
01:39:01,334 --> 01:39:02,584
Throw the gun over

1444
01:39:03,209 --> 01:39:05,292
Don't obey. Don't let him have the gun

1445
01:39:06,001 --> 01:39:07,209
Throw the gun over

1446
01:39:08,084 --> 01:39:09,084
Wu Jiang

1447
01:39:18,334 --> 01:39:22,584
You're right. Someone must pay

1448
01:39:26,667 --> 01:39:28,792
I'll do anything for my sister

1449
01:39:31,084 --> 01:39:33,209
Sadly, now I know I'll never escape

1450
01:39:34,542 --> 01:39:37,501
One last game, Zhong. You and me.

1451
01:39:38,334 --> 01:39:42,959
There's one bullet left.
Shoot before the next train

1452
01:39:43,292 --> 01:39:47,209
Shoot me and I'll stab her in the neck

1453
01:39:47,709 --> 01:39:50,459
Shoot yourself and she lives

1454
01:39:50,667 --> 01:39:52,709
Dad, don't believe him

1455
01:39:55,001 --> 01:40:00,042
Shoot me and I'll stab her neck

1456
01:40:00,417 --> 01:40:03,251
Shoot yourself and she lives

1457
01:40:03,626 --> 01:40:06,792
Don't shoot, I'll kill her anyway

1458
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:09,917
Who lives? Who dies? It's up to you

1459
01:40:14,459 --> 01:40:17,709
I was late then because I was saving someone else

1460
01:40:18,501 --> 01:40:20,084
I was wrong to blame you

1461
01:40:20,376 --> 01:40:21,667
Unfortunately, I failed there, too

1462
01:40:21,709 --> 01:40:23,834
Zhong, the train's coming

1463
01:40:24,501 --> 01:40:27,876
I'll take responsibility for your sister's death

1464
01:40:28,792 --> 01:40:31,084
My daughter

1465
01:40:31,126 --> 01:40:32,501
has nothing to do with this

1466
01:40:32,751 --> 01:40:34,751
Please don't hurt her, no matter what

1467
01:40:34,917 --> 01:40:39,542
I want to see you be that kind of father

1468
01:40:41,001 --> 01:40:42,001
I'll give you ten seconds before I shoot

1469
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:43,251
No, Dad

1470
01:40:49,709 --> 01:40:50,709
Child,

1471
01:40:52,917 --> 01:40:54,501
I've been a bad father.

1472
01:40:55,209 --> 01:40:56,417
I had no time for you,

1473
01:40:57,584 --> 01:40:59,334
and made you feel vulnerable.

1474
01:40:59,917 --> 01:41:00,917
Sorry

1475
01:41:02,501 --> 01:41:05,417
But… for you

1476
01:41:05,501 --> 01:41:06,584
I'll do anything

1477
01:41:12,167 --> 01:41:13,667
One…

1478
01:41:24,126 --> 01:41:27,417
Sorry. I removed the bullet just now

1479
01:41:28,376 --> 01:41:30,584
I would do anything for my sister

1480
01:41:31,709 --> 01:41:32,709
A small trick

1481
01:41:41,251 --> 01:41:44,042
Zhong, I admire you.

1482
01:41:46,417 --> 01:41:47,334
Go wait for me on the platform

1483
01:41:47,376 --> 01:41:48,584
Dad, I can't go

1484
01:41:48,751 --> 01:41:50,709
Go, get someone! This is an order! Now!

1485
01:41:51,001 --> 01:41:53,959
Run

1486
01:41:55,126 --> 01:41:56,501
Is there anything else, Zhong?

1487
01:41:57,709 --> 01:41:59,126
I have to arrest you

1488
01:41:59,376 --> 01:42:00,834
Say I disappeared.

1489
01:42:00,959 --> 01:42:02,584
I'd do anything for my sister

1490
01:42:03,626 --> 01:42:04,751
I'd die for her

1491
01:42:04,792 --> 01:42:05,792
Wu Jiang!

1492
01:42:06,334 --> 01:42:07,417
Get out of my way

1493
01:42:07,459 --> 01:42:08,417
It's not worth it

1494
01:42:08,459 --> 01:42:10,501
I'll take the blame

1495
01:42:16,876 --> 01:42:19,251
Ignore me, as if I were a bug

1496
01:42:20,126 --> 01:42:21,126
Don't worry about me

1497
01:42:38,917 --> 01:42:41,167
Give up. You can still live

1498
01:42:57,751 --> 01:42:58,876
Goodbye

1499
01:43:04,459 --> 01:43:09,959
Down the well-lit street

1500
01:43:11,459 --> 01:43:18,251
A cold spell suddenly attacks

1501
01:43:18,542 --> 01:43:22,126
Distant warmth cannot

1502
01:43:22,167 --> 01:43:25,292
Relieve nearby sorrows

1503
01:43:25,334 --> 01:43:31,417
Am I just going with the flow?

1504
01:43:32,584 --> 01:43:36,084
As long as the story continues

1505
01:43:36,126 --> 01:43:40,167
I must remain on defense

1506
01:43:40,584 --> 01:43:44,792
Loyal to my own battle

1507
01:43:44,834 --> 01:43:45,834
Hurry, get a doctor!

1508
01:43:49,084 --> 01:43:51,376
Hang in there

1509
01:43:52,667 --> 01:43:53,792
You threw the switch?

1510
01:43:53,834 --> 01:43:55,751
Yes. Perfect timing, right?

1511
01:44:01,667 --> 01:44:08,167
What can I use for my rescue

1512
01:44:08,209 --> 01:44:14,209
When love has drained away

1513
01:44:14,834 --> 01:44:19,334
Who can keep whom

1514
01:44:19,376 --> 01:44:26,709
Who will my heart wait for

1515
01:44:28,501 --> 01:44:34,917
What can I use for my rescue

1516
01:44:35,001 --> 01:44:41,501
Love is like a poison arrow

1517
01:44:41,542 --> 01:44:45,959
Who can protect whom

1518
01:44:46,001 --> 01:44:54,417
Who can make love last forever

1519
01:44:54,626 --> 01:44:55,626
Wait

1520
01:45:02,834 --> 01:45:04,376
Good one, brother

1521
01:45:05,709 --> 01:45:07,001
That hurt

1522
01:45:07,126 --> 01:45:08,459
All the hostages are safe,

1523
01:45:08,876 --> 01:45:10,334
no penalty for you

1524
01:45:10,501 --> 01:45:11,626
How's Wei Xiaofu?

1525
01:45:11,792 --> 01:45:12,876
He's a tough kid

1526
01:45:14,001 --> 01:45:15,334
Take care of your father

1527
01:45:19,376 --> 01:45:21,167
Dad, you're great

1528
01:45:21,417 --> 01:45:22,626
I'm very ordinary

1529
01:45:22,667 --> 01:45:24,709
Stop being humble, cop

1530
01:45:27,584 --> 01:45:31,209
Take it easy on me from now on

1531
01:45:34,709 --> 01:45:37,376
Wu Jiang says, you win this round

1532
01:45:38,001 --> 01:45:40,709
This is for you. He says goodbye

1533
01:45:46,042 --> 01:45:47,251
Double slate

1534
01:45:49,376 --> 01:45:51,292
You gonna clap it on my nose?

1535
01:45:57,667 --> 01:45:58,709
Watch his foot!

1536
01:45:59,917 --> 01:46:01,834
Why didn't we use a fake knife?

1537
01:46:03,501 --> 01:46:04,501
Sorry, Jackie

1538
01:46:04,792 --> 01:46:05,792
Go again

1539
01:46:10,001 --> 01:46:10,542
Fake it-

1540
01:46:10,584 --> 01:46:12,334
we're shooting a movie, Bro

1541
01:46:12,917 --> 01:46:13,917
Then go and fight

1542
01:46:17,542 --> 01:46:18,001
Stop

1543
01:46:18,042 --> 01:46:18,417
Jackie

1544
01:46:18,459 --> 01:46:19,459
Your ear

1545
01:46:24,917 --> 01:46:25,959
It looks funny again

1546
01:46:26,084 --> 01:46:27,542
Your nose

1547
01:46:28,126 --> 01:46:28,626
Let's do another take

1548
01:46:28,667 --> 01:46:29,334
Go again

1549
01:46:29,626 --> 01:46:30,751
Again

1550
01:46:31,292 --> 01:46:32,042
Wait

1551
01:46:32,084 --> 01:46:32,959
This is no good

1552
01:46:33,001 --> 01:46:33,709
It's so hard

1553
01:46:33,876 --> 01:46:34,667
Can we do this?

1554
01:46:34,792 --> 01:46:35,792
This won't work

1555
01:46:35,834 --> 01:46:37,251
So you want this

1556
01:46:37,584 --> 01:46:38,584
This way, then

1557
01:46:38,626 --> 01:46:39,626
It's so difficult!

1558
01:46:41,501 --> 01:46:43,042
He's just not a good choice

1559
01:46:43,084 --> 01:46:49,792
Look at the… $%… %&!@&…

1560
01:46:50,001 --> 01:46:51,084
I'm speaking Portuguese

1561
01:46:51,876 --> 01:46:53,751
Just look at the company you keep —

1562
01:46:54,251 --> 01:46:56,334
Look at the people he's with

1563
01:46:56,459 --> 01:46:56,834
Slap me

1564
01:46:56,876 --> 01:46:57,667
Please slap me

1565
01:46:57,709 --> 01:46:58,501
Slap me

1566
01:46:58,542 --> 01:47:00,126
I beg you, slap me

1567
01:47:00,709 --> 01:47:02,042
I beg you, slap me

1568
01:47:04,792 --> 01:47:05,792
Jackie

1569
01:47:05,876 --> 01:47:07,542
You're just not good company —

1570
01:47:10,001 --> 01:47:13,251
the company… (garbled)

1571
01:47:13,459 --> 01:47:15,209
You're not in good company —

1572
01:47:15,251 --> 01:47:16,584
Who is good company —

1573
01:47:17,209 --> 01:47:18,834
You shouldn't be in company —

1574
01:47:19,417 --> 01:47:21,542
He's with different people every day —

1575
01:47:22,917 --> 01:47:23,959
I quit

1576
01:47:25,042 --> 01:47:26,292
I'll refund my pay

1577
01:47:28,542 --> 01:47:29,542
Stand still

1578
01:47:58,209 --> 01:47:59,376
Hello

1579
01:48:02,959 --> 01:48:04,167
Say it boldly

1580
01:48:04,209 --> 01:48:05,042
He's afraid

1581
01:48:05,084 --> 01:48:07,042
then he &%&…!!

1582
01:48:11,001 --> 01:48:12,251
He's on screen

1583
01:48:16,042 --> 01:48:17,626
What have you done?

1584
01:48:18,917 --> 01:48:19,542
Jackie

1585
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,376
Don't

1586
01:48:20,584 --> 01:48:21,209
I didn't

1587
01:48:21,251 --> 01:48:22,042
Go

1588
01:48:22,126 --> 01:48:23,876
Now you're talking like a good father

1589
01:48:23,917 --> 01:48:25,792
I have another line, go again

1590
01:48:26,126 --> 01:48:27,251
Sorry

1591
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:28,709
I'll punch you later

1592
01:48:30,042 --> 01:48:30,584
Damn

1593
01:48:30,626 --> 01:48:31,459
It won't break

1594
01:48:31,501 --> 01:48:32,501
That really hurts

1595
01:48:35,917 --> 01:48:37,126
Go again

1596
01:48:42,001 --> 01:48:43,167
Yes!

1597
01:48:44,959 --> 01:48:46,084
Jackie broke it

1598
01:48:48,084 --> 01:48:49,542
I've proven I can break it

1599
01:48:50,667 --> 01:48:51,292
You said it's unbreakable,

1600
01:48:51,334 --> 01:48:52,334
So I had to break it

1601
01:48:52,709 --> 01:48:54,376
Especially with Jaycee Fang here

1602
01:48:54,417 --> 01:48:55,626
I must prove it to him

1603
01:48:55,751 --> 01:48:57,167
Why won't it open?

1604
01:48:57,209 --> 01:48:58,542
What's going on?
