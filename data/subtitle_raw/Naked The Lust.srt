1
00:01:56,625 --> 00:02:02,625
[Mob talking]

2
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:15,708
[Mob talking continuing]

3
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:31,375
[Weeping]

4
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,000
All of you move out.

5
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,500
Go out...

6
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,083
The safe locker looks broken...

7
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,375
thief might have intruded to rob.

8
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,208
How did it happen?

9
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,167
He came home night at 9:30 pm.

10
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,333
He slept without partaking dinner.

11
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,792
When I came in the morning to serve him coffee...
he was lying like this, sir.

12
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,542
Must have been murdered him
by slitting his throat, when he was sleeping.

13
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,958
Only two of you stay in the flat, right?

14
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,625
Didn’t you hear any noise,
when he was fighting for his life.

15
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,125
No sir, I didn’t hear any sounds...

16
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,750
Does your husband have a wrangle with anyone?

17
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,500
As far as I know, there is no one, sir.

18
00:03:58,167 --> 00:04:00,083
He is very friendly and decent.

19
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:08,208
Yesterday night, didn’t two of you share the same bed?

20
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:09,708
Sorry...

21
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,083
Don’t feel bad.

22
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,625
In the course of an investigation...
it becomes inevitable to ask such questions.

23
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,083
Generally, a wife and husband sleep on the same bed.

24
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,000
That’s the reason I asked you the question.

25
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,292
He indicated yesternight, that he is not feeling well.

26
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,667
Hence, I went and slept in another room.

27
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,208
He spoke to me yesterday too, sir.

28
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,792
I interacted with him here, at the lawn.

29
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,833
Who are you?
-My name is Madhan, sir.

30
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:38,417
Watchman???

31
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:38,958
No sir.

32
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:43,667
Ok.

33
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:45,333
On the other side also, there is an entrance gate.

34
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:56,042
Is that CC camera in working mode?

35
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:57,417
Yes sir, it is working.

36
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,167
Alright.

37
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,125
I want the entire footage of that cc camera.

38
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,167
Ok sir.

39
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,458
I want both of you to give honest replies to my questions.

40
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,417
If you give fallacious answers, I will not spare you.
-I don’t have any compulsion to state falsehood, sir.

41
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:09,917
We will tell truth of the matter.
-We will tell you what we know.

42
00:05:09,917 --> 00:05:10,708
Do you know Aravind?

43
00:05:13,417 --> 00:05:14,375
On which floor, do you reside?

44
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,375
On third floor, sir.

45
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:17,417
Do you know Aravind,
who resides in your apartment, died?

46
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,083
Yes, I know sir.

47
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:20,917
Did you hear any sounds at 2 O’clock in the night?

48
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:23,083
We were in stupor at that time.
-We didn’t hear any sounds, sir.

49
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,958
Did Aravind have any arch foes?

50
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:26,250
No, he doesn’t have any adversaries,
as for my understanding, sir.

51
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,417
Did he have good relations with all.
-Yeah.. He has cordial ties with all.

52
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:32,792
You don’t worry about your safety.
Tell me the truth.

53
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:34,333
We have told you what we know.
-We told the whole truth, sir.

54
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,333
No problem will befall on you.

55
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,792
Ok sir.
-Ok sir.

56
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,375
If I come to know that you have lied,
then consequences will be drastic.

57
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,250
How long have you been working in their house?

58
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,958
Working in their house for past 3 months.

59
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:00,375
What type of person is Aravind?

60
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:01,500
He is a decent person.

61
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,208
How does he behave with you?

62
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:04,500
He behaves in courteous manner.

63
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,208
Where are you from?

64
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:07,792
Vizag.

65
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,250
Vizag?

66
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,167
How many years elapsed from the
time you came from Vizag?

67
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:17,750
Sir, Sir...

68
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:19,125
One year completed, sir.

69
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,292
Where did you work the initial 9 months?

70
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:24,042
Worked in another house.

71
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:30,083
Ok. Now tell me what happened
without hiding anything?

72
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,458
I don’t understand what you are alluding to, sir?

73
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,333
I know you understand everything...

74
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,375
Why did you kill Aravind???

75
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,292
I didn’t kill, sir.

76
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:42,833
If you didn’t kill, then what forced you
to hide this knife?

77
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:48,875
You killed Aravind and to escape from being
apprehended, you concealed the knife.

78
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,542
Yes or No.

79
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,417
No, sir. I didn’t kill.

80
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:56,167
Will you tell or shall I make you revel,
using my style of interrogation.

81
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,625
No. I will tell, sir.

82
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,292
Tell...

83
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,750
What transpired on that day, was...

84
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:17,958
Hey Jyothi...

85
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,250
what is this...?

86
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:22,958
See how it is...clean here...

87
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,125
Hey see here...

88
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:41,708
when did you last clean it...

89
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,417
Daily, I am cleaning sir.

90
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,083
Clean now...

91
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,958
If you do like this again,
I will have to inform madam. Leave me...

92
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,458
Hello SI sir, how are you?

93
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:53,333
Nothing...Lost a gold chain in our house.

94
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,333
Only me and my wife stay in the house...

95
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,250
but a maid regularly visits and leaves the house after work.

96
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,125
she is an honest servant,

97
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,208
but....

98
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,375
No, sir.... No, sir.

99
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:13,750
Ok... I’ll search my house once again...
then report you.

100
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:15,917
Please don’t tell sir.

101
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,500
If I it is found, ok sir.
Otherwise please come and investigate...

102
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,458
Thank you, sir. Thank you so much.

103
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,375
No... No...

104
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:27,917
Don’t...
-No...

105
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,250
No...

106
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:30,750
Don’t tell...
-No...

107
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:48,583
No.

108
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:27,042
He used to intimidate me with that video...
and exploit me daily.

109
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:37,708
Unable to bear his repeated sexual abuse...
I reported the whole matter to my husband.

110
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,417
Let’s relocate to some other place, dear.

111
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:44,042
I committed larceny...

112
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,917
taking advantage of it, he started ravishing me...

113
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,750
I’ll butcher that debaucher into pieces...

114
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,583
I'll kill that bastard.

115
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,833
No dear, let’s not commit any felony...

116
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,875
we will go to our village.

117
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,083
We will go...

118
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:01,000
after killing that bastard, we will proceed to our village.

119
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,833
No dear... stop.

120
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,042
dear...No...

121
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,083
Dear... stop...

122
00:13:10,167 --> 00:13:10,833
No...

123
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,833
It is in my hands.

124
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,583
Why should I worry, when you are here, bro.

125
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,375
Ok... Ok...

126
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:38,917
What Sekhar, I asked you to summon a plumber....
What happened???

127
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,125
We will talk about it... Don’t worry about it.

128
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,583
Your work will be over, bro.

129
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:50,667
Fearing you will suspect my husband
upon seeing that knife, I dumped it.

130
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,250
Oh... because he couldn’t kill in the noon...
he committed it at night.

131
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,000
No, sir.

132
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,333
the whole night my hubby was with me.

133
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,000
There is no possibility that
he could have killed.

134
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:07,667
Ok...

135
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:09,833
you have to report whenever I summon you.

136
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,292
Alright sir.

137
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,083
Ok. Now you may leave.

138
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:17,958
Did receive the cc tv footage.

139
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,250
Yes. We received it sir.

140
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,125
You seem to be going somewhere?

141
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,333
I have some urgent work to attend...
that’s why I am leaving.

142
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:35,833
Going out to settle account???

143
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:45,333
A murder took place in an apartment, below yours.

144
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,750
Yet you appear to be unflustered and happy.

145
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,042
Do you any enmity towards him?

146
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:51,208
No.

147
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,125
we are actually good friends.

148
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,292
The whole of yesterday, we were in shock.

149
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:58,250
Today an emergency arose, so I am going out.

150
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,917
To windup things expeditiously.

151
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,208
So, that no problem befalls on you.

152
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,917
I am not able to comprehend
what you are talking.

153
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:08,958
Will understand...

154
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,667
slowly you will understand.

155
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:12,458
My husband doesn’t know anything about it, sir.

156
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,917
I didn’t ask him anything.

157
00:15:13,917 --> 00:15:15,792
Why are you trying to explain that your
husband doesn’t know anything about it?

158
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,875
You are pointing an accusing finger at us and speaking.

159
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:23,458
See, initially everyone will say they don’t know anything.

160
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,917
Later they will state that it happened inadvertently.

161
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,750
This is the footage from cc tv camera
located outside your apartment.

162
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,708
Do you think that Police will believe whatever you tell,
at the face value and leave without investigating?

163
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:07,667
Tell me now.

164
00:16:08,583 --> 00:16:09,583
what happened?

165
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,458
My husband didn’t do harm to him, sir.

166
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,500
He only threatened my husband
that he will murder him.

167
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:20,833
Contemplating that he may murder your hubby,
have you forestalled and finished him off?

168
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:23,583
Sir, how many times should I tell you, sir. I didn’t murder him.

169
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,125
What happened?

170
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,125
I will tell you the whole story from the beginning.

171
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:43,208
Wow...

172
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:51,167
Oh... be careful...

173
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,417
This is very heavy.

174
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,542
I will bring it. Come on.

175
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,083
No problem. I will carry it.

176
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,625
No. its heavy. Lemme do it.

177
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,833
It's ok. Thank you. I can carry.

178
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,625
Not at all. Let me give bring it.

179
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,458
Thank you.

180
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:02,083
Most welcome.

181
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:04,500
I haven’t seen you around in this building.

182
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,208
We are new to this place.
Came yesterday.

183
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,833
Nice. Which floor?

184
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:08,500
1st floor.

185
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,833
Oh... nice..
We stay on 2nd floor.

186
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:14,167
Thank you

187
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,792
Most welcome.
-Thank you so much.

188
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:30,958
Coffee is good.

189
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:39,583
Hai darling.
-Hi baby.

190
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,500
Meet my husband.

191
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:42,750
She is Priya. Newly shifted to our apartment.

192
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,208
Is it? You have already become friends!

193
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:47,000
You already know her.
Did she become your acquaintance already?

194
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,458
Not like that.

195
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,208
When they were shifting the other day, the suitcase
she was carrying was heavy... I lent a helping hand.

196
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:54,125
You guys carry on. I will freshen up and join you.

197
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:57,667
So.
-So...

198
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,875
Tell me.
-Everything is going good.

199
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:00,667
Super cool.

200
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,750
Archana, please don’t disturb me.

201
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,917
Hey, what's your problem..?

202
00:18:23,917 --> 00:18:25,417
Let me work. It’s very important.

203
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:27,250
If you have guts... let’s see.

204
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,875
You are completely crazy.

205
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:35,833
Hello...

206
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,125
Archana...
-Yaa, Priya...

207
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,458
my system is hanging up.

208
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,208
If you know anyone,
could you send someone please.

209
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,042
I will send my hubby. He will solve the problem.

210
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:44,833
Ok..?
-Ok.

211
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,333
Don’t worry.

212
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:45,708
Thank you.

213
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,125
Bye Priya
-Bye.

214
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,917
Listen Baby...

215
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:52,583
Priya has some computer problem, go and solve, please.

216
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:54,500
Ouch... you go and solve it.

217
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,792
Darling... please...

218
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,208
Hey come on...

219
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,542
I have to attend to our household problems...
now I have to even solve other’s household problems too.

220
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:01,417
What is this!
-Just go.

221
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,625
Just one minute... I’ll call you back.

222
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:57,708
Hi...

223
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,000
It seems you have complained about some system problem.

224
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,750
It was working in the morning...

225
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,750
but I don’t know... suddenly encountered some problem.

226
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,583
Is it?
-Yeah...

227
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,083
Come... let’s look at it.
-Please come.

228
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,292
Did you update any anti-virus program in this system?

229
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:22,458
Yeah... very recently, it did it.

230
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:36,667
Now, it’s working... problem solved.

231
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,708
Oh... great!!! Thank you so much.

232
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,417
Four..!

233
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:42,875
What???

234
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:47,125
From the time we met to till now,
you have thanked me four times.

235
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,917
Ok... God!!!

236
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,167
Ok. I will take leave.

237
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,167
Thank you.

238
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,042
Count is Five.

239
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:57,458
Ok.

240
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,167
Play... will you drop the card tomorrow or what?

241
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,375
Why are you shouting? First play your game.

242
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,250
These women take lot of time to play.

243
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:14,667
I am drop.

244
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:16,833
Play.

245
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:17,792
Go and bring some tea.

246
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,417
Priya, today you are going to partake lunch with us.

247
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,875
I am preparing chicken fry.

248
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,167
Fix it slightly to your right.

249
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,167
Will you please give that item?

250
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:54,792
Oh sure.

251
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:27,667
Take this.

252
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:41,542
It will look better here.

253
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:52,083
Aravind...

254
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:55,708
this system is always posing problems.

255
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,125
But you don’t care about it.

256
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,875
How many times should seek this gentleman’s help?

257
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,417
I can’t handle this.

258
00:24:00,792 --> 00:24:01,750
Can you change it.

259
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:03,958
There is no need to change, bro.

260
00:24:04,208 --> 00:24:07,792
There was some minor OS problem.
I solved it now.

261
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:09,417
Now your computer doesn’t have any problem.

262
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:10,417
It's working fine.

263
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:12,750
Oh... You said you were working
on some venture?

264
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:14,375
How far it has come?

265
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:16,917
It’s almost in the finishing stage.

266
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:19,000
Very soon it will be done.

267
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,208
Ok. I will make a move.
-Thank you.

268
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,625
Bye bro, see you.
-Okay.. bye.

269
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,292
Okay.

270
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:47,417
I am going to Jubilee hills to give applications.

271
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:48,500
Can you come with me?

272
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,375
Oh Baby! I told you yesterday that
I have a lot work scheduled for today.

273
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:54,292
See, I am getting calls relentlessly.

274
00:25:54,417 --> 00:25:55,583
Will you come with me?

275
00:25:55,792 --> 00:25:58,292
It’s just a matter of just 4 to 5 hours.

276
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:02,750
Sorry baby. I have a lot of work on hand.
I have to create a web page.

277
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,458
Sorry.

278
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,667
Ok. Then I will go all alone myself. Bye.

279
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:11,542
Bye.

280
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,542
Does he meet you daily?

281
00:27:52,917 --> 00:27:54,375
Does he come the moment I get out?

282
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,417
Is that why you preferred this flat?

283
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,708
Does he perform better than me?

284
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:08,625
Sorry dear...

285
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,625
It happened unwittingly.

286
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,542
You...

287
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:18,958
Sorry dear...

288
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,083
Please... No...
I will not do it again.

289
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,167
Hey Aravind how are you?

290
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,625
Hey, what is this? What are you doing?

291
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,833
Your husband is cohabiting my wife...
You too copulate with me.

292
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,125
Aravind, leave her alone.

293
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:50,750
What are you doing, rascal?
What are you doing?

294
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,125
You are enjoying with my wife. Aren’t you?

295
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,500
Your wife fell for me and seduced me.

296
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:57,292
Then send your wife to make love to me.

297
00:28:57,792 --> 00:28:58,750
Hey, I'll kill him.

298
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:02,375
Stop it.

299
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:17,792
Tell me.

300
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,292
Did you finish your dinner?

301
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:24,542
What is your wife doing?
Is she awake or sleeping?

302
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:27,083
Thinking of paying a visit.

303
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,417
You scoundrel...

304
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,292
You have enjoyed my wife...

305
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:33,958
If I enjoy your wife, then it will get even.

306
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:36,042
You are exceeding the limits...

307
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,250
Will you go first or shall I make a move on your wife.

308
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,333
I’ll kill you scumbag,
if you talk another word about my wife.

309
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,333
Kill me???

310
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,750
Yes, I’ll kill you.

311
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,500
I’ll see.

312
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,333
Shall I come now.

313
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:47,417
Disconnect the phone you rascal.

314
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:05,042
Shall I come tomorrow for your wife.

315
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:06,083
Is tomorrow ok for you.

316
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:09,708
Your game is finished.

317
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,708
You have meddled with me.

318
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:13,250
I’ll kill you, if you call me again...

319
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,708
Bastard!

320
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,250
Will you fornicate with your wife first
or will you allow me?

321
00:30:29,917 --> 00:30:31,625
I’ll kill you, you bastard.

322
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,375
Aye ... put it down.

323
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:48,875
Someday, you are going to die in my hands.

324
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:52,208
This is what has happened sir.

325
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:54,208
Ok.

326
00:30:55,667 --> 00:30:56,458
Let’s meet again...

327
00:30:58,083 --> 00:30:59,000
Let’s meet again...

328
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:12,708
Did Aravind had any enemies?

329
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:17,583
To narrate about his living.... He is a big sadist.

330
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,417
He is a womaniser.

331
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,083
He doesn’t spare a single lady within his reach.

332
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:24,292
But recently...

333
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:29,417
I witnessed him wrangle with Arjun,
an employ in his organization, 2-3 times.

334
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:31,708
Arjun.

335
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:34,708
Arjun.

336
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:38,375
Your name?

337
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:39,250
Arjun.

338
00:31:39,792 --> 00:31:40,708
What did you study?

339
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,208
Engineering.

340
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,167
How long have you been working with Aravind?

341
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:46,250
For the past two years I am working with him.

342
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:48,708
Your boss was murdered?
Did you know that.

343
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,750
Why did you kill your boss?

344
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:54,250
I didn’t kill him.

345
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:59,125
We have evidences to prove that you
had twice attempted to murder him.

346
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:02,292
Why did you kill?

347
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:03,750
Speak out everything.

348
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,125
I believed him very much.

349
00:32:06,083 --> 00:32:06,833
But he...

350
00:32:08,917 --> 00:32:09,542
I...

351
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:12,958
I feel in love with a girl named Stella,
who works in our office.

352
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,000
We both even decided to get married.

353
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:34,417
Arjun, did you inform to your people at home?

354
00:32:34,417 --> 00:32:36,292
Informed... Daddy agreed.

355
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:40,542
If you somehow manage to impress
my mother, then she will also agree.

356
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,333
After that marriage only, right?
-Wow...!

357
00:32:42,583 --> 00:32:43,958
Later honeymoon.

358
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:48,167
We both have our jobs.
We can settle in our life happily.

359
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:49,333
Yeah true.

360
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,208
Love you baby.

361
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:50,833
Love you.

362
00:32:54,833 --> 00:32:57,042
He used intermittently state that
he will perform our marriage.

363
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:58,667
But instead that trickster...

364
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:05,208
Hi Sir.

365
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:20,292
Ok uncle, I will call you later...

366
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:08,333
I will guarantee you a hike in your pay...

367
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,375
and promotion for sure.

368
00:34:13,042 --> 00:34:14,000
Thank you.

369
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:44,500
I am sorry Arjun, please...

370
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,833
Arjun...I am sorry...

371
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,208
Don’t come near me. Go away.

372
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,875
How did you think of deceiving me?

373
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,708
How much did I Love?

374
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,792
Arjun, please Arjun...
intentionally I didn’t do it, Arjun.

375
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,292
He trapped me Arjun.

376
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:02,875
If he trapped, didn’t you comprehend...
didn’t you feel our love?

377
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:04,125
You loved me.

378
00:38:04,417 --> 00:38:07,375
I placed my head in your lap and professed my love.

379
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,458
but you stabbed here, in my heart.

380
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,500
You asked me to take permission of my Father
and my mother, they okayed it.

381
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Now what should I do?

382
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,000
Finally, you made me a fool.

383
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:19,000
You are still able to stand before me
because of the fact that I love you.

384
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:20,500
Otherwise I would have killed you.

385
00:38:23,708 --> 00:38:24,458
Leave me.

386
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,625
Go away.

387
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:40,583
I told you, your work will be over, right bro.
You come it will be over.

388
00:38:40,583 --> 00:38:44,542
How much I believed you? Why ditch me?

389
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,833
How much I trusted you.

390
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:52,167
In the name of hike and increase in salary,
why did you trap my lover?

391
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:52,708
Hey, get lost.

392
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:23,792
Hey fool... If you interfere in my dealings
once more, I’ll kill you.

393
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,667
I will not leave you...

394
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,708
I’ll kill you.

395
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,333
This is what happened sir.

396
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:35,250
But I didn’t harm Aravind in any way, sir.

397
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,667
How long have you been working in the office?

398
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:40,208
One year.

399
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:43,792
Apart from Arjun, does Aravind has
squabbles with any other person?

400
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,583
To tell the truth... yes, he has...

401
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,292
Three people wanted to kill him...

402
00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:06,875
who would have killed him?

403
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:10,458
who would have killed him?

404
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:13,458
The whole night my husband was with me.

405
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:15,333
But that bugger...

406
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:16,708
doesn’t spare a single lady within his reach.

407
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:18,833
He's very friendly and decent.

408
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,917
I did not harm Arvind.

409
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:28,458
My husband didn't harm him, Sir.

410
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:33,292
One...

411
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:35,708
Two...

412
00:40:38,042 --> 00:40:38,667
Three...

413
00:40:40,583 --> 00:40:41,833
Did forensic reports come?

414
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:42,917
Yes sir, they have come.

415
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,458
Hey, you are a vey smart person.

416
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:57,375
Hey constable, go inside and check.
-Okay Sir.

417
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:58,500
Hello... hello... what is this?
-I will tell.

418
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,750
We know you have murdered Aravind
prudently and freaking out.

419
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,917
What is this? I didn’t murder him.

420
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:02,583
Is it?

421
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:06,083
Then how come you finger prints and
foot prints clearly matched with those at the crime site.

422
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,583
My finger prints?
-Yes, yours only.

423
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:09,292
What happened Vikram?

424
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:12,917
Your husband committed murder
and created false alibi.

425
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:15,125
Found this knife under the mattress, sir.

426
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:19,042
Perpetrated murder and concealed
the knife in the house, Huh??

427
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:22,292
Sir, I am not aware how it got into my possession.

428
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:23,667
Your acting superbly, man.
-Please believe me, sir.

429
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:26,458
Please listen sir, I don’t know.
-Let’s go to station, we will discuss it there.

430
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,542
Baby...

431
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:17,500
Yeah.

432
00:42:17,875 --> 00:42:20,792
You getting married... I getting married...

433
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:22,417
Having babies...

434
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:24,583
you having a husband .... Me possessing another...

435
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,125
this all will not work out.

436
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:28,125
I have an idea.

437
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:28,708
What?

438
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:33,333
My plan is... you marry a rich person...
I too will wed a wealthy person...

439
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:40,625
Later on, I will murder my wealthy husband and incriminate your
husband in the crime, so that he will be incarcerated.

440
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:44,125
Thereafter we will inherit their complete wealth and will be free.

441
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:48,458
We can together enjoy our life... It will be bindaas.

442
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,750
This is my plan.

443
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,208
Your plan is superb.

444
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:52,292
Lovely baby.

445
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:57,750
We are new to this place.
Came yesterday.

446
00:42:57,833 --> 00:42:59,375
Oh..! Which floor?

447
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:00,042
1st floor.

448
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,167
Your husband is not a mug.

449
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,208
He is very smart.

450
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:11,083
He is just trying to seduce me.

451
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:14,125
Within a week, he will come in our line.

452
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:15,125
Yes.

453
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,417
Yes!

454
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:17,708
Perpetrated murder and concealed
the knife in the house?

455
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:52,833
Babies...

456
00:44:53,958 --> 00:44:59,917
I have proved beyond doubt that
your husband killed her husband.

457
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:02,958
Fingerprints are also in our favor.

458
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:05,208
Now, one can prove and apprehend either of you.

459
00:45:05,917 --> 00:45:09,417
This is the best deal in my life.

460
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:12,375
2 crores of money...

461
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:16,667
and 2 super figures on either side.

462
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:14,042
Cheers...

463
00:46:33,125 --> 00:46:44,958
There are more truths we do not know...
behind the facts we know.
