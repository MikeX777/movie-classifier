00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:10,017
Oh, sexy Becks,

3
00:01:10,017 --> 00:01:13,402
can you fill in one of
these and give it to Steve?

4
00:01:13,402 --> 00:01:16,485
Apparently someone's got to go today.

5
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:25,397
Becks, have you been in yet?

6
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:29,694
Uh, no, why, has everyone else?

7
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:32,898
No, there's only three left though.

8
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:33,731
Uh, who?

9
00:01:34,796 --> 00:01:35,629
Uh, him,

10
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:39,184
him.

11
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:42,458
To be honest with you, I
think it's probably fine.

12
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:44,059
If you haven't got an email by now

13
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:45,979
I think you're safe as houses.

14
00:01:49,273 --> 00:01:50,106
Oh, uh.

15
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:54,393
You'll be all right,
you'll be all right.

16
00:01:54,393 --> 00:01:57,489
Just smile through it,
you work really hard.

17
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:58,739
Thanks, okay.

18
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,295
Yep, come in.

19
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,677
Please um, have a seat.

20
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:26,510
Thanks.

21
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,214
So, Rebecca Louise Williams.

22
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,113
Thank you for filling in
the DISC analysis form.

23
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:39,194
Uh, hopefully these things are
a benefit for both parties.

24
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:40,560
You know the soap.

25
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,260
Well, you've been with
us for three months now.

26
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,843
Um, what I would say
is that your strengths

27
00:02:48,154 --> 00:02:50,460
naturally tend to lie in the S

28
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,651
and the C end of the spectrum.

29
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:55,759
Um, you're steady, conscientious.

30
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,941
All these things are very
healthy and positive things

31
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:01,936
for an office work space like this one.

32
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:04,889
Uh, what I would say, however, is

33
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:09,038
we do need to have a look at
the D and the I going forward.

34
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:13,689
Um, it's not exactly been a
banner year for the company

35
00:03:13,689 --> 00:03:16,540
so I am anticipating some restructuring

36
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,373
later in the year, so.

37
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:20,951
We'll get together and have another chat

38
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,591
in three months' time, if that's okay.

39
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:25,277
But for now we're very
pleased with your progress.

40
00:03:25,277 --> 00:03:26,110
Thank you.

41
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:28,471
Great thanks.

42
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,883
I will work on the D and I.

43
00:03:34,512 --> 00:03:35,345
Okay.

44
00:03:56,887 --> 00:03:57,720
Becks.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,120
Barry's in there at the moment.

46
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,453
Oh, no poor Barry.

47
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:09,160
They can't get rid of Barry.

48
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,450
Well, if it's not Barry then who is it?

49
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,917
Okay, oh, look, he's smiling.

50
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:15,651
Oh, he's okay, thank God.

51
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:16,818
He's coming.

52
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:26,474
Oh, you all right?

53
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,199
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,566
Mr. Kingdom's agreed to
come to my leaving party.

55
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:33,024
Will you guys will all be there

56
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,761
and everybody in the office, yeah?

57
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:35,857
Yeah.

58
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:37,158
Of course.

59
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:37,991
Yeah.

60
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:55,874
All right, five o'clock,
I'm going to Barry's.

61
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:57,277
Becks, you coming?

62
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:58,110
Yeah, I.

63
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:02,652
Well, I'll see you down there.

64
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:05,603
Come on, big boy, you coming out?

65
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:07,310
I might go, I'm not sure.

66
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,797
Mate, you ready, we've
got to go to football.

67
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:11,320
Ahh, football, sorry.

68
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,153
You've got to be joking!

69
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:12,986
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:13,819
Are you serious?

71
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:14,950
You owe me a drink, babe.

72
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,533
I know, I owe you soon, soon.

73
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:19,266
You ready?

74
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:26,457
Let's go.

75
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,857
Thanks fuck!

76
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,199
Are you eating toast again?

77
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,143
Did mum leave you tea?

78
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:00,976
No.

79
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:06,764
Mum and Terry left you a note.

80
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:22,041
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

81
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:26,284
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

82
00:06:26,284 --> 00:06:27,867
10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

83
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:37,252
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

84
00:06:37,252 --> 00:06:39,131
10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

85
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:40,881
Stay, 15, 16, 17, 18.

86
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,047
Olly, you've used all.

87
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:34,838
Shut up.

88
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,432
Hi, Tina, it's Becky, Diane's
daughter from next door.

89
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:07,603
And this is my brother Olly.

90
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:08,685
I think you know him already.

91
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:09,621
Oh, hi, Olly.

92
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,289
I've been called out on some really

93
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:12,411
important work drinks tonight.

94
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:14,489
I was just wondering if you
mind watching Olly for me.

95
00:08:14,489 --> 00:08:15,993
Oh, sorry, love, I can't.

96
00:08:15,993 --> 00:08:17,409
I've got people around myself.

97
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:18,761
Oh, that's fine, he
can look after himself.

98
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:20,088
He's a really good boy.

99
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:21,938
It's just if you can
keep an eye out for him.

100
00:08:21,938 --> 00:08:24,885
All right, I'll keep an eye out for him.

101
00:08:24,885 --> 00:08:26,154
Mom, I'm hungry.

102
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:28,904
Tyler, will you get to bed now?

103
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,023
Right, well, have a nice evening, Becky.

104
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,347
Okay, bye-bye, thanks, Tina.

105
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,598
Have a nice evening, thanks, okay, bye.

106
00:08:40,451 --> 00:08:41,284
Come on.

107
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:03,112
All right, Steve?

108
00:09:03,112 --> 00:09:06,681
Becky, what time do you call this?

109
00:09:06,681 --> 00:09:08,598
Oh, I was just at home.

110
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:12,502
Steve, what's with the, uh,

111
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:16,182
you look like you've been
to a wedding or something.

112
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,453
No, no, I mean, I didn't mean.

113
00:09:18,453 --> 00:09:20,308
No, no, it's fine, it's fine.

114
00:09:20,308 --> 00:09:21,480
Are the others inside?

115
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,964
They are, yes.

116
00:09:22,964 --> 00:09:25,165
It's about to get messy,
so I'm gonna scooch off.

117
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:26,077
Yeah, all right.

118
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:27,910
Have a good evening.

119
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:01,866
Oh my God, look at you.

120
00:10:01,866 --> 00:10:02,926
You look gorgeous.

121
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:04,758
- Oh, thank you.
- Hey.

122
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:06,054
Hi, yeah good.

123
00:10:06,054 --> 00:10:07,631
I like your dress.

124
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:08,922
Oh thank you.

125
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:12,840
Thanks, I just, I didn't
think you were coming.

126
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:14,574
Coming out?

127
00:10:14,574 --> 00:10:15,407
Mm-hmm.

128
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:18,571
Oh, no, I wasn't gonna,
but I played football

129
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:19,693
with the lads.

130
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:20,526
Yes.

131
00:10:20,526 --> 00:10:22,111
Yeah, because I thought
you might be coming,

132
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:25,444
so I told Vicki to mention it, you know.

133
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:30,165
Yeah, no um, that's cool.

134
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:32,320
Yeah, but you look very nice.

135
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Thank you.

136
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:36,391
Oh, look at this!

137
00:10:38,035 --> 00:10:40,702
Oh, Barry, you demon, come on.

138
00:10:42,165 --> 00:10:43,323
Becky made it.

139
00:10:43,323 --> 00:10:45,680
Becky, Becky, Becky, Becky, Becky!

140
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,431
Barry, Barry, Barry.

141
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:49,181
Okay, okay.

142
00:10:51,153 --> 00:10:53,497
Okay, okay, shots time, shots time!

143
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:54,330
Is this mine?

144
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,947
One for you.

145
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,181
One for you.

146
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:58,743
Just so you know,
you're doing two at least.

147
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:00,279
I don't want to do one, no.

148
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,508
Shots time, shots time.

149
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:03,393
Salt, salt, salt, salt, salt.

150
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:05,807
I think you ought to slow down.

151
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:07,640
Three, two, one, go!

152
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:20,621
I've got it all down myself.

153
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:21,454
Ugh, ooh.

154
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:24,367
I could get that.

155
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,955
- Barry.
- Did you like it?

156
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:27,288
No, no do you?

157
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:29,128
Yeah.

158
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:29,961
Is that your favorite?

159
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:31,406
All right, you know what I want?

160
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:33,823
Excuse me, if you don't mind.

161
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:36,332
Come on big boy.

162
00:11:36,332 --> 00:11:37,165
No, no, no.

163
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:37,998
Come on, you're dancing with me.

164
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:40,210
No, you promised, you promised earlier.

165
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,703
Come on, you've got to.

166
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:42,861
Okay, we'll get in one dance.

167
00:11:42,861 --> 00:11:44,295
Yeah, but just me and you for now.

168
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:45,712
Come on, come on.

169
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:05,620
Was Becky wearing that at work?

170
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,950
No, no.

171
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:07,865
Were you wearing that at work?

172
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:10,615
I was, yes, don't you remember?

173
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,425
Is somebody else driving, who's driving?

174
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:18,987
Oh, you know!

175
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:21,693
Hey, come dance with me.

176
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:22,526
What?

177
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:24,282
Come on, me and you.

178
00:12:24,282 --> 00:12:27,259
Come on, I want to see the booty shake.

179
00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:29,361
What are you talking about?

180
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:30,606
I'm a really bad dancer.

181
00:12:30,606 --> 00:12:32,389
No, we're dancing.

182
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:35,602
I'm a really, really bad dancer.

183
00:13:31,925 --> 00:13:35,481
Oh, Barry,
Barry, come on, up you get.

184
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,148

Come on, sit down.

186
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,710

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,932

00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:46,272
No, I fell, yeah.

190
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:48,424
Yeah, I just fell down.

191
00:13:48,424 --> 00:13:49,678
You seriously
don't need any more alcohol.

192
00:13:49,678 --> 00:13:50,930
I only fell down.

193
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,778
Seriously.

194
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:53,712
Do you need some water?

195
00:13:53,712 --> 00:13:54,831
No, chips.

196
00:13:54,831 --> 00:13:55,664
Cheesy chips?

197
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:56,497
Cheesy chips.

198
00:13:56,497 --> 00:13:59,125
Chips, chips, chips.

199
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,093
Oh yeah, chips.

200
00:14:00,093 --> 00:14:01,243
Come on, can you walk?

201
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:04,569
Yeah, yeah, yeah, chips.

202
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:07,236
Right, I need my bag and shit.

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,474
Thank you.

204
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:22,057
Good night, guys.

205
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:25,304
So, um,

00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:29,067
I'm gonna head home.

207
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:29,900
Yeah?

00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,934
Yeah, I probably should.

Um, well, I'm gonna get that cab, so.

00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:43,891
We'll split it, we will split it.

215
00:14:43,891 --> 00:14:44,808
Split it.

216
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:52,601

217
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:53,648

Whoo, party!

00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:07,940
Come on, come on!

222
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,023
I got sick on my shirt.

223
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:14,576
Uh, so yeah, everyone
just comes through this way.

224
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:15,409
Is this the bathroom?

225
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:16,472
No, no, no, that's my brothers room.

226
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:17,382
That's Olly's.

227
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:18,843
Sorry, that.

228
00:15:18,843 --> 00:15:19,679

Yeah, go through there.

Do you wanna do the honors?

00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,073
Shh, yeah, yeah.

251
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:06,999
Mm hmm.

252
00:16:10,112 --> 00:16:10,945
Ooh.

253
00:16:14,984 --> 00:16:16,413
I couldn't swallow it!

254
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,862
Oh, sorry about that, we
don't have anything else.

255
00:16:21,862 --> 00:16:22,845
Can we take it through?

256
00:16:22,845 --> 00:16:24,998
Yeah, yeah, finish
it, honestly, finish it.

257
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:25,831
Okay.

258
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:28,382
The lounge is
just, um, just there.

259
00:16:28,382 --> 00:16:30,768
Not the bedroom, Barry.

260
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:33,065
Do you want, um, is there
anything I can get you.

261
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:33,898
No, um.

262
00:16:36,034 --> 00:16:38,870
You can explain something to me though.

263
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,199
Yeah, what?

264
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,782
Um, what the hell

265
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:46,709
is this?

266
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:53,206
The Book of English
Magic, by Philip Carr-Gomm

267
00:16:55,755 --> 00:16:59,017
and Richard, I can't pronounce that.

268
00:16:59,017 --> 00:16:59,850
Heygate.

269
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,267
Ah, what is it?

270
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:03,490
Are you a witch?

271
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,726
Obviously I'm not a witch.

272
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:05,559
What are you...

273
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,132
Uh, explain the book.

274
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:09,049
Well, no, I just, I
got that when I was a kid

275
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:11,811
from my granddad, and I just really,

276
00:17:11,811 --> 00:17:13,279
I like fairies.

277
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:14,112
'Cause you're a witch.

278
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:14,952
Can I have that back, please?

279
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,425
No, tell me what it is.

280
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:17,617
No, come on, please?

281
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:18,946
Can I just have that, please?

282
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:20,458
No, come on, witchy, tell me what it is.

283
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,026
Witchy, I'm not.

284
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:22,859
Well, tell me.

285
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,953
It's completely unfair.

286
00:17:24,953 --> 00:17:26,827
That's from when I was a kid!

287
00:17:26,827 --> 00:17:28,994
A kid, okay, okay, okay.

288
00:17:29,905 --> 00:17:31,488
Ugh.

289
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:33,291
Let me read, come on,
you put the page down.

290
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,299
Let me read it.

291
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:35,549
Let me read it.

292
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:40,534
"On a Friday evening at full moon,

293
00:17:40,534 --> 00:17:42,884
"throw salt into a fire

294
00:17:42,884 --> 00:17:46,551
"and carve your lover's
name into an onion."

295
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:51,975
Who's your lover, is
it Barry, is it Steve?

296
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:52,808
It is me?

297
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:55,441
Oh, come on, look, this is why I like you.

298
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:59,608
This is weird, I've never seen
this before, but it's cute.

299
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:02,292
Can you give it back, please?

300
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:04,209
Yeah, come on get it.

301
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:15,984
You know, it's a full moon tonight.

302
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:23,715
Um,

303
00:18:28,823 --> 00:18:32,114
should we, can you just wait one minute?

304
00:18:32,114 --> 00:18:33,141
Do you mind?

305
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:36,344
I just need a minute, actually.

306
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:38,095
One minute, just wait there.

307
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:39,036
I'll be back.

308
00:18:39,036 --> 00:18:40,786
I'll be back out, sorry.

309
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,619
Just give me a minute.

310
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:09,412
Oh.

311
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:11,771
Oh, hi, Beck, sorry, you're up.

312
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:13,083
We thought you'd gone to bed.

313
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,164
Carly said you might have gone to bed.

314
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:18,563
No, I was just, um, um, phone call.

315
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:20,991
Oh, well, we've ordered a cab, babe,

316
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:23,816
'cause we thought you'd gone
to bed, so we've gotta go.

317
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:24,649
Sorry.

318
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:28,978
Okay, uh, why, stay for another drink.

319
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:30,695
I've got loads, there's
loads of drink in there.

320
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:32,413
Yeah, no, I think we've got time for...

321
00:19:32,413 --> 00:19:34,007
No, our cab is here, babe.

322
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,067
You know, meter's running, so.

323
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:39,488
But you know, I had such
a good time, thank you.

324
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:40,738
See you Monday.

325
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:44,276
Are you sure you don't
want to have a drink?

326
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:45,109
I mean...

327
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:46,753
Uh, no, I think I should leave it.

328
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,941
I mean, I got pretty tired waiting.

329
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:52,608
No, I've got stuff,
I've got cycle tomorrow.

330
00:19:55,412 --> 00:19:56,662
Thanks, I'll see you Monday.

331
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:21,329
Olly, was, um, was there
anyone here when you got up?

332
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:22,579
I don't know.

333
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:25,457
I'm just asking.

334
00:21:25,457 --> 00:21:28,339
Have you been eating crisps for breakfast?

335
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:29,454
They were already there.

336
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,870
Well, that's not the point, is it?

337
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,093
I told you, do not eat
crisps for breakfast.

338
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:34,718
Eat something healthy.

339
00:21:34,718 --> 00:21:35,906
It's not good for you.

340
00:21:35,906 --> 00:21:37,656
Get off the computer!

341
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,631
What, don't look at me like that!

342
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:42,783
Get off the computer.

343
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:44,037
We're going to go to the park, all right?

344
00:21:44,037 --> 00:21:48,050
Can you just get up and
go and brush your teeth?

345
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:48,883
Olly?

346
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,973
Olly?

347
00:21:52,201 --> 00:21:53,034
Thank you.

348
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:13,757
Hey.

349
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:17,291
Sexy Becks, I fell
asleep at yours on Friday.

350
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,169
When I woke up, Carly wasn't there,

351
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:22,368
but Barry was, and you know what I'm like.

352
00:22:22,368 --> 00:22:25,109
I just wanted to check nothing
happened 'cause I think.

353
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:27,217
Vicki can I...

354
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:30,473
Talk to you in a bit, okay?

355
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:46,485
Why are you still here?

356
00:22:46,485 --> 00:22:48,103
I'm not, I am going.

357
00:22:48,103 --> 00:22:51,975
I just had to sort one
last thing, I'm gone.

358
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:53,618
All right, well, look, happy hunting.

359
00:22:53,618 --> 00:22:54,710
Get out there and knock them dead.

360
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,687
Sweet, cool.

361
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:57,520
Yeah.

362
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,353
Okay.

363
00:23:00,027 --> 00:23:02,860
See you in a couple weeks, mate.

364
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,344
Hey, sweetheart.

365
00:23:10,314 --> 00:23:11,147
You all right?

366
00:23:11,147 --> 00:23:12,017
Yeah, yeah.

367
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:12,918
How you doing?

368
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:13,751
Mm hmm.

369
00:23:13,751 --> 00:23:15,433
Thanks for Friday night, by the way.

370
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:16,862
I had such a good time.

371
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,090
Oh good.

372
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,090
I'm just a bit tired,
feeling the effects.

373
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:25,147
But, uh, yeah, it was really good.

374
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:28,383
So, um, did you have a good one?

375
00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:30,861
Mmm, yeah, no, it was wicked.

376
00:23:30,861 --> 00:23:32,771
Good night.

377
00:23:32,771 --> 00:23:34,359
Oh I almost forgot.

378
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,007
We're supposed to get those reports out

379
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:37,731
sort of two past three,

380
00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:39,871
so I'm going to need that
in about half an hour.

381
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:43,871
But you know, there's no
rush or anything, okay?

382
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:04,118
You gonna help me today?

383
00:24:04,118 --> 00:24:05,951
No, I'm kinda bored.

384
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:08,949
Used to help Gran, though.

385
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:11,593
Yeah, but Gran is dead.

386
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:12,426
Right.

387
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:16,591
Hello.

388
00:24:16,591 --> 00:24:17,424
Hi.

389
00:24:17,424 --> 00:24:18,257
Hi.

390
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:19,257
Hi.

391
00:24:20,204 --> 00:24:21,454
Smile, maybe?

392
00:24:22,644 --> 00:24:23,477
Hi.

393
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:27,337
Hi.

394
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:46,446
You gonna come?

395
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,293
No thank you.

396
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:21,404
Becky Williams, what are you up to?

397
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:22,405
Hi, Steve.

398
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:26,048
Yeah, um,

399
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:27,964
yeah, I'm just actually looking

400
00:27:27,964 --> 00:27:30,981
for a toy for my brother, yeah.

401
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,128
Okay, what, in here?

402
00:27:33,128 --> 00:27:34,378
Yeah, I know.

403
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:37,746
Okay, well, how old is he?

404
00:27:37,746 --> 00:27:38,913
Um, he's 11.

405
00:27:40,462 --> 00:27:41,295
Hmmm.

406
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:45,888
Well, it's a bit young
for 11, to be honest.

407
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:49,222
Ah, I might have to go somewhere else.

408
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:52,588
Well, nice seeing you.

409
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:54,500
Very nice to see you, yeah, yeah.

410
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,720
Have a lovely weekend.

411
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,132
Sorry, I'm in your way.

412
00:27:57,132 --> 00:28:00,104
Oh, that's all right, oops, sorry.

413
00:28:00,104 --> 00:28:00,977
Good to see you.

414
00:28:00,977 --> 00:28:01,810
Oops.

415
00:28:12,016 --> 00:28:13,367
Becky.

416
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:16,165
Becky, just hang on a sec.

417
00:28:16,165 --> 00:28:17,881
Sorry, I just remembered.

418
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:19,667
There is actually this fantastic toy

419
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:21,206
shop where you should go.

420
00:28:21,206 --> 00:28:23,318
Honestly, it's unlike
anywhere else in town.

421
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:24,901
It's, it's kind of,

422
00:28:26,176 --> 00:28:27,661
problem is it's a bit tucked away.

423
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:30,578
It's behind the railway station and

424
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,932
do you know what?

425
00:28:32,932 --> 00:28:33,898
I'm actually going that way.

426
00:28:33,898 --> 00:28:38,008
If you, I mean, I could
show you, if you fancy.

427
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:41,928
Uh, yeah, yeah, okay,
I'm going that way too, so.

428
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:45,532
You won't regret this, honestly.

429
00:28:45,532 --> 00:28:46,863
I used to, um,

430
00:28:46,863 --> 00:28:48,622
I used to go there when I was a kid.

431
00:28:48,622 --> 00:28:49,900
- Oh, yeah.
- When I was about 11.

432
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,754
Okay.

433
00:28:50,754 --> 00:28:51,587
This is where I used to go.

434
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:52,497
So you know it really well then.

435
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,330
You've lived here all your...

436
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,509
I've lived here all my life, yeah, so.

437
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:58,881
There was a time when you
could walk up the side street

438
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:03,800
and get a good old-fashioned
cup of English tea, you know?

439
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,211
Nowadays it's just, you
know, coffee, coffee, coffee.

440
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,507
Coffee here, coffee there.

441
00:29:07,507 --> 00:29:08,921
I got coffee coming out my ears.

442
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:12,114
Oh, uh, you're not a coffee drinker?

443
00:29:12,114 --> 00:29:13,106
Well, I mean, I like coffee.

444
00:29:13,106 --> 00:29:14,028
I'm not saying that.

445
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:17,253
I'm just, it's just
Reading, like you know,

446
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:19,586
everywhere in this country these days,

447
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:22,673
it's just become enslaved
to the conquistadors

448
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:24,766
of the chain stores, you know?

449
00:29:24,766 --> 00:29:26,577
You may be thinking,

450
00:29:26,577 --> 00:29:30,278
"How am I possibly gonna
find a toy for my brother

451
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:32,252
"which isn't exactly like every other toy

452
00:29:32,252 --> 00:29:35,670
"owned by every other kid in this store?"

453
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,248
You stick with me 'cause
I am gonna show you

454
00:29:38,248 --> 00:29:40,488
the dark side of the moon.

455
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:42,519
We have just passed the last stop on

456
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,507
the corporate coffee trail.

457
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:47,128
Yeah, I can't believe
I've never even been here.

458
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:48,455
Well, hold on to your hats

459
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:51,758
because we are now entering
the unknown quarter.

460
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:52,694
Okay.

461
00:29:52,694 --> 00:29:54,177
Mm hmm.

462
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:57,696
For example, look over my shoulder there.

463
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:58,772
Yeah.

464
00:29:58,772 --> 00:30:01,345
Jane Austen went to school there.

465
00:30:01,345 --> 00:30:02,250
Really?

466
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,250
The Jane Austen, yeah.

467
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:10,507
Presumably etched her name
into a desk at some point.

468
00:30:10,507 --> 00:30:11,674
Jane was here.

469
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:17,446
Another famous resident
was Oscar Wilde, of course.

470
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:18,571
I mean, he wasn't here by choice.

471
00:30:18,571 --> 00:30:21,071
He was over there in the jail.

472
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:24,146
See it on the horizon?

473
00:30:24,146 --> 00:30:26,271
Sentenced for being a very naughty boy

474
00:30:26,271 --> 00:30:28,080
with members of the same sex,

475
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,374
and sent, of course, then
to an all-male prison,

476
00:30:31,374 --> 00:30:35,542
which I'm sure the irony of
that wasn't wasted on Mr. Wilde.

477
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:39,871
Okay, now, we're almost there.

478
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,160
Even I'm getting excited.

479
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,577
Abracadabra, huh?

480
00:30:45,569 --> 00:30:46,975
This is just a display window.

481
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:49,392
You wait until we get inside.

482
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,063
Come on, ladies first.

483
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:00,586
Ah, Sir James!

484
00:31:01,615 --> 00:31:03,940
Not you again, good lord.

485
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,617
You know me, I can't
stay away for too long.

486
00:31:05,617 --> 00:31:07,850
And I see you've got
your daughter with you.

487
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,593
Yeah, the old ones are the best.

488
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:11,075
It's a joke, I'm joking.

489
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:13,099
Okay, so what can I do for you today?

490
00:31:13,099 --> 00:31:14,455
We're actually here today, Jim,

491
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,378
on a bit of a mission, actually.

492
00:31:16,378 --> 00:31:18,440
Becky here has a younger brother,

493
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,409
and we're looking for
a toy present for him.

494
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:22,936
Something a bit, you know.

495
00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:23,769
Yeah.

496
00:31:23,769 --> 00:31:26,506
What sort of things is
your brother into then?

497
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:28,506
He like war, fighting.

498
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:33,226
I think I might just
have one little item,

499
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:35,296
so give me a moment, and I'll
be back with you in a second.

500
00:31:35,296 --> 00:31:36,660
Feel free to have a look around.

501
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:37,715
We will, we certainly will.

502
00:31:37,715 --> 00:31:39,215
Thank you.

503
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:42,437
What did I tell you, huh?

504
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:45,040
It's a treasure trove, isn't it?

505
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,794
Wow, look at this.

506
00:31:46,794 --> 00:31:47,627
So cool.

507
00:31:48,928 --> 00:31:52,088
Yeah, well, this is a cabinet
that always makes me ache

508
00:31:52,088 --> 00:31:54,050
just a little bit.

509
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,105
There's stuff in here that I remember

510
00:31:56,105 --> 00:32:00,403
having when I was a kid, and
it just got chucked away.

511
00:32:00,403 --> 00:32:01,436
Aw, that's such a shame.

512
00:32:01,436 --> 00:32:03,823
Chucked in a skip somewhere, yeah.

513
00:32:03,823 --> 00:32:07,490
This is amazing, Olly
would love all this.

514
00:32:10,252 --> 00:32:11,877
Anyway, the oracle returns.

515
00:32:11,877 --> 00:32:15,317
Okay, folks, well, you're in luck.

516
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:18,734
I found this, a model kit from the 1950s.

517
00:32:22,496 --> 00:32:24,913
This is so amazing.

518
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:26,915
Oh my god.

519
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:31,733
Your brother needs to
obviously form it and glue it

520
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:36,669
and paint it and pose it,
but it's a little unusual.

521
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:37,944
This is so cool.

522
00:32:37,944 --> 00:32:38,777
What do you think?

523
00:32:38,777 --> 00:32:40,718
I think this is, yeah.

524
00:32:40,718 --> 00:32:42,711
Before and the after there.

525
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,796
Yeah, I think he'd really like this.

526
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:48,965
Well, thanks for that,
Steve, that was amazing.

527
00:32:48,965 --> 00:32:50,658
Oh, no, thank you.

528
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:52,319
I'm going to jam this.

529
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:54,049
Conceivably it's the first reggae album

530
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:56,148
ever committed to vinyl.

531
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:59,113
I hope Olly is as happy
with that as I am with this

532
00:32:59,113 --> 00:33:02,105
'cause I am like a pig
in hot shit right now.

533
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,708
Oh, I'm sure he will be.

534
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:09,064
Listen, I have to go
pick up some dry cleaning,

535
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:12,843
but can I give you a lift somewhere?

536
00:33:12,843 --> 00:33:14,343
Um, don't worry.

537
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:17,355
I live in Woodley,
which is, the other way,

538
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:20,930
so it's fine, I'll just get a bus.

539
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:21,763
Okay, sure.

540
00:33:21,763 --> 00:33:23,341
Thanks though.

541
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:27,852
No, I'll see on, uh,
I'll see you Monday, yeah.

542
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:30,502
Yeah, okay, I'll see you Monday.

543
00:33:30,502 --> 00:33:31,872
I enjoyed that, by the way.

544
00:33:31,872 --> 00:33:33,039
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

545
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:36,695
- See you.
- See you.

546
00:33:52,352 --> 00:33:53,519
God.

547
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:55,901
Sorry, hi.

548
00:33:56,742 --> 00:33:58,578
Hi, how are you?

549
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,662
Yeah, good, you all right?

550
00:34:00,662 --> 00:34:02,267
I'm good, thanks, Stripes?

551
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:03,853
Oh, yeah, how are you doing?

552
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:04,767
I'm good, I'm good.

553
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:05,600
Where should we go?

554
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,904
Oh, nice to see you, I don't know.

555
00:34:06,904 --> 00:34:08,239
I know a coffee shop around here.

556
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,793
Let's get out of the
sun, I'm going to burn.

557
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:10,973
Yeah, yeah, of course.

558
00:34:10,973 --> 00:34:11,806
Okay.

559
00:34:11,806 --> 00:34:12,639
All right, just up here, I think.

560
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,556
Let's go.

561
00:34:15,104 --> 00:34:17,715
Oh, my God, this is amazing!

562
00:34:17,715 --> 00:34:19,879
Look how cheap it is!

563
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:22,403
Oh, my God, you never see that in London.

564
00:34:22,403 --> 00:34:24,269
This is so good!

565
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:26,047
You can so get on the property ladder.

566
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:29,278
Look, oh, you get bar stools.

567
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:30,523
Funny.

568
00:34:30,523 --> 00:34:33,190
You must have so much money now.

569
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:36,818
Living with your mom, you're so lucky.

570
00:34:36,818 --> 00:34:38,945
Yeah, I've got a bit, you know?

571
00:34:38,945 --> 00:34:40,238
You know, I'm really happy at home.

572
00:34:40,238 --> 00:34:41,119
It's all right.

573
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,384
Yeah, but you should rent,
look, you could rent this.

574
00:34:43,384 --> 00:34:44,840
Just set yourself up.

575
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,062
It's so much better being on your own.

576
00:34:46,062 --> 00:34:47,923
Harry and I are having such a wicked time.

577
00:34:47,923 --> 00:34:48,904
Aw, good.

578
00:34:48,904 --> 00:34:51,220
Oh, parking, that's good for you.

579
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,053
Do you have a car?

580
00:34:52,053 --> 00:34:52,886
Oh no.

581
00:34:54,146 --> 00:34:55,729
I like this, ooh.

582
00:34:56,653 --> 00:34:59,620
Oh, no, it's near the
hospital, I don't like that.

583
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,084
There's too many sick people around.

584
00:35:01,084 --> 00:35:02,093
Oh well.

585
00:35:02,093 --> 00:35:04,532
I can't believe I haven't
even see your place yet.

586
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:05,703
Oh, my God, yeah.

587
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:09,173
I mean, I'd love to see some
photos, if you've got any.

588
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,138
I actually do.

589
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:11,846
I have loads of photos,
I've been showing everyone.

590
00:35:11,846 --> 00:35:12,792
You have to come and visit.

591
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:13,669
It will be so fun, I think.

592
00:35:13,669 --> 00:35:15,061
This is the room, I'm gonna show you.

593
00:35:15,061 --> 00:35:16,196
I've actually got an album.

594
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:17,029
Okay.

595
00:35:17,029 --> 00:35:18,738
This is the room I finished.

596
00:35:18,738 --> 00:35:19,880
Oh, that looks amazing.

597
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:23,445
It is, I searched high and low for that.

598
00:35:23,445 --> 00:35:25,264
Yeah, it's really, really, lovely.

599
00:35:25,264 --> 00:35:26,551
It's not as shiny as it looks.

600
00:35:26,551 --> 00:35:28,531
No, you've done a
really good job, actually.

601
00:35:28,531 --> 00:35:31,249
Thanks, okay, that maroon
chair, that's Harry's.

602
00:35:31,249 --> 00:35:32,312
He just likes it, I don't know.

603
00:35:32,312 --> 00:35:35,742
He's weird, it's like a family thing.

604
00:35:35,742 --> 00:35:36,742
Oh, Harry.

605
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:40,129
Oh I was a bit drunk.

606
00:35:40,129 --> 00:35:42,286
Oh, did you have a housewarming?

607
00:35:42,286 --> 00:35:43,900
No, it was just a bit local.

608
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,650
It's just Chloe was...

609
00:35:51,655 --> 00:35:52,822
Richard, go?

610
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:55,961
Yeah, because of Harry.

611
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:59,701
Mm-hmm, yeah, he looks really well.

612
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:00,868
He is.

613
00:36:03,236 --> 00:36:05,438
Who's that?

614
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:08,521
She wasn't with us at Union, was she?

615
00:36:11,496 --> 00:36:14,079
Don't torture yourself.

616
00:36:16,649 --> 00:36:17,482
Sorry.

617
00:36:18,435 --> 00:36:19,631
Sorry, it doesn't matter at all.

618
00:36:19,631 --> 00:36:20,591
Harry told me...

619
00:36:20,591 --> 00:36:21,424
Yeah of course.

620
00:36:21,424 --> 00:36:22,840
We broke up, it's fine.

621
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,710
You were texting Richard.

622
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,807
Yeah, of course.

623
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:29,310
Yeah, uh, I did, I did
the other night, yeah,

624
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,732
which was stupid, and I'm
really embarrassed about it.

625
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:34,233
Yeah, just tell him I'm sorry.

626
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:40,342
You have to let it go, Becky.

627
00:36:40,342 --> 00:36:42,092
Yeah, I know, okay.

628
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:43,983
Okay.

629
00:36:45,441 --> 00:36:47,882
Um, I'll show you, um.

630
00:36:47,882 --> 00:36:50,125
I've got loads of stuff
to show you around here.

631
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,012
You've never been here before, so.

632
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:54,056
Just come with me, and I'll show you.

633
00:36:54,056 --> 00:36:56,085
Sorry, how embarrassing.

634
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:28,115
How's it going?

635
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:28,948
Mm hmm.

636
00:37:30,157 --> 00:37:34,568
Just wondering how the
toy went down with Olly.

637
00:37:34,568 --> 00:37:35,951
'Cause I have to say me and my new tunes

638
00:37:35,951 --> 00:37:37,847
have been getting on like a house on fire.

639
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:40,519
Oh, yeah, no, he really liked it.

640
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,254
Sat down, put it all together?

641
00:37:42,254 --> 00:37:43,087
Mm hmm.

642
00:37:44,224 --> 00:37:45,296
Really?

643
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,622
Mm hmm, no.

644
00:37:46,622 --> 00:37:47,672
He couldn't
be bothered, could he?

645
00:37:47,672 --> 00:37:49,781
No, he didn't like it.

646
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:52,470
Yeah, well, I don't
think you can take it back.

647
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,691
He did say that.

648
00:37:53,691 --> 00:37:56,718
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he did.

649
00:37:56,718 --> 00:38:01,112
You realize you're
photocopying blank paper there.

650
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,195
Think of the trees, yeah?

651
00:38:11,524 --> 00:38:12,542
I just don't get it, Scotty.

652
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:14,801
I don't get how something
this idiotic can happen.

653
00:38:14,801 --> 00:38:16,039
It's an invoice, for fuck's sake.

654
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,425
It's not rocket science.

655
00:38:17,425 --> 00:38:19,368
It was a grand, it was
a grand on the invoice,

656
00:38:19,368 --> 00:38:21,112
and you knock a fucking nought off,

657
00:38:21,112 --> 00:38:23,269
and he's paying a hundred
quid for these man hours!

658
00:38:23,269 --> 00:38:24,345
Are you kidding me?

659
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:25,230
I just don't get it, Scotty.

660
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,762
I don't get how you can do
something so fucking idiotic.

661
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:30,138
It's so fucking easy to
get confused, isn't it?

662
00:38:30,138 --> 00:38:31,362
Because look at it!

663
00:38:31,362 --> 00:38:33,370
No, wait, don't you dare
speak to me like that!

664
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,046
Don't you dare swear at me!

665
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,264
Are you having a laugh?

666
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:37,847
Carly, just look.

667
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:42,538
People make mistakes, all right?

668
00:38:42,538 --> 00:38:45,168
You know that, I know that.

669
00:38:45,168 --> 00:38:47,289
The trick is, Scotty, you
gotta to salvage this,

670
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:48,324
mate, all right?

671
00:38:48,324 --> 00:38:49,157
Okay.

672
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:51,357
Now, you need to get on
the phone to Mr. Khan, yeah?

673
00:38:51,357 --> 00:38:53,093
Tell him this is a special reduced rate

674
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:55,683
we do for new business, all right?

675
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:57,674
You need to make him sign
up for a second month.

676
00:38:57,674 --> 00:38:58,507
Yeah, damn right.

677
00:38:58,507 --> 00:38:59,708
Full price.

678
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:02,050
Let's try and get some
business going here, yeah?

679
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,252
Let's show good faith.

680
00:39:04,252 --> 00:39:06,067
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

681
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:08,162
Come on, you
can do it, I know you can.

682
00:39:08,162 --> 00:39:08,995
All right.

683
00:39:08,995 --> 00:39:09,828
Chin up.

684
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:13,512
And watch the language around Carly.

685
00:39:13,512 --> 00:39:15,762
All right, mate, all right?

686
00:40:16,843 --> 00:40:17,676
Hello.

687
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:20,242
Hi, Mom!

688
00:40:21,306 --> 00:40:23,586
Yeah, I'm fine, how you doing?

689
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:25,193
Just doing some washing, actually.

690
00:40:25,193 --> 00:40:26,811
You'll be pleased to know.

691
00:40:26,811 --> 00:40:29,398
Yeah, the house is all fine.

692
00:40:29,398 --> 00:40:31,231
Yes, and the goldfish.

693
00:40:33,136 --> 00:40:33,970
What?

694
00:40:35,502 --> 00:40:39,292
No, what, just tell me, I've got no idea.

695
00:40:39,292 --> 00:40:40,659
Mom.

696
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:43,783
Oh, Mom, that's amazing, that's so cool.

697
00:40:43,783 --> 00:40:47,197
Aw, congratulations, that's incredible.

698
00:40:47,197 --> 00:40:50,747
Aw, bless Terry, when did he do that?

699
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:52,664
Aw, did he have a ring?

700
00:40:53,597 --> 00:40:55,514
Aw, that's so romantic.

701
00:40:56,908 --> 00:41:01,177
Yeah, no, we're all fine here, of course.

702
00:41:01,177 --> 00:41:03,412
What, like another week?

703
00:41:03,412 --> 00:41:05,310
Yeah, no, of course, don't worry about us.

704
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,310
That's fine.

705
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:10,587
Yeah, look, take as long as you need.

706
00:41:10,587 --> 00:41:12,268
Yeah, I can imagine.

707
00:41:12,268 --> 00:41:13,748
Aww.

708
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:15,921
Oh, Olly, it's Mom on the phone.

709
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:17,187
It's Mom, yeah, yeah, yeah.

710
00:41:17,187 --> 00:41:18,516
Mom, Olly's just come out of his room.

711
00:41:18,516 --> 00:41:21,488
Let me pass you across to him.

712
00:41:21,488 --> 00:41:22,322
Hi, Mom.

713
00:41:25,637 --> 00:41:28,054
So when are you getting back?

714
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:32,948
It's just, I really miss you.

715
00:41:35,073 --> 00:41:36,499
Just don't tell anyone, all right?

716
00:41:36,499 --> 00:41:37,332
I won't.

717
00:41:37,332 --> 00:41:38,165
I'll make an announcement this afternoon

718
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:41,832
to all of the office
and everyone will find.

719
00:41:43,771 --> 00:41:45,507
Becks, I've got news.

720
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:48,625
Big news, you know how
I saw Andy last night?

721
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:49,458
Yeah.

722
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,300
Follow me.

723
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,383
What's going on, Vicki?

724
00:41:56,171 --> 00:41:57,004
Fuck.

725
00:41:58,169 --> 00:41:59,002
Oh, ugh.

726
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:03,965
It stinks.

727
00:42:05,047 --> 00:42:07,215
It's not half as bad as Andy's.

728
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:09,741
Speaking of which, he's
in the toilet last night.

729
00:42:09,741 --> 00:42:11,702
This is how I find out, right?

730
00:42:11,702 --> 00:42:13,978
He goes to the toilet, and I
have a look in his pockets.

731
00:42:13,978 --> 00:42:15,989
I know I'm not supposed to, but you know.

732
00:42:15,989 --> 00:42:18,483
I look in his pockets,
and I find this receipt,

733
00:42:18,483 --> 00:42:22,316
and the receipt is for
350 pounds for jewelry.

734
00:42:24,631 --> 00:42:25,964
Oh, wow great.

735
00:42:27,787 --> 00:42:30,349
So I'm waiting all night,
I'm waiting and I'm thinking,

736
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:31,792
"He's gonna propose, he's gonna propose,

737
00:42:31,792 --> 00:42:33,012
"he's gonna propose," right?

738
00:42:33,012 --> 00:42:34,793
I wasn't expecting to
be proposed to in a pub,

739
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:36,100
but you know, it's fine.

740
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,568
It's fine, and nothing happens.

741
00:42:38,568 --> 00:42:40,869
And I'm thinking, "Oh, God, oh, God."

742
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:42,532
Then the end of the night comes,

743
00:42:42,532 --> 00:42:44,250
and he says that we're
going away this weekend.

744
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:46,149
He's booked us into some Travel Inn thing

745
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:47,953
just on the way to Gatwick,

746
00:42:47,953 --> 00:42:50,471
so he's going to propose
this weekend, isn't he?

747
00:42:50,471 --> 00:42:54,449
Brilliant, um I really hope he does too.

748
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:56,695
So I go home and I look up which ones

749
00:42:56,695 --> 00:42:58,698
they could be on the
internet, and I found two.

750
00:42:58,698 --> 00:43:02,031
I recon it's this one, right, 16 stones!

751
00:43:03,808 --> 00:43:05,874
16 stones, can you believe it?

752
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:06,939
Lovely.

753
00:43:06,939 --> 00:43:09,900
So anyway, this afternoon I booked Mix.

754
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,868
Everyone's gotta come.

755
00:43:10,868 --> 00:43:12,772
Don't worry, you're gonna be a bridesmaid.

756
00:43:12,772 --> 00:43:14,180
Both of you, right?

757
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,535
But everyone's gonna come this afternoon.

758
00:43:15,535 --> 00:43:17,897
Wait, wait, wait, what,
tonight you've booked?

759
00:43:17,897 --> 00:43:20,040
Oh, that's lovely, but
maybe you should wait

760
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,639
until after he's proposed
and you're actually engaged.

761
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,165
And then maybe we could have
like a big celebration then,

762
00:43:27,165 --> 00:43:29,554
which would be better to do it
then rather than now, Vicki.

763
00:43:29,554 --> 00:43:32,854
No, don't you think maybe, a good idea?

764
00:43:32,854 --> 00:43:33,771
Why wait?

765
00:43:34,872 --> 00:43:37,185
Way to ruin it, Becks.

766
00:43:37,185 --> 00:43:38,737
Vicki, maybe we should wait though.

767
00:43:38,737 --> 00:43:39,870
Do you not think it
would be a better idea?

768
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,758
Then we could have a big celebration then,

769
00:43:41,758 --> 00:43:43,288
rather than spreading it all out.

770
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,648
It would be much more fun.

771
00:43:45,648 --> 00:43:46,915
I can have all the parties I want.

772
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,507
I can have a party now,
I can have a party after,

773
00:43:48,507 --> 00:43:49,416
I could have a wedding!

774
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:50,713
I'm getting married!

775
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:51,546
Oh yeah.

776
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,992
I'm getting married!

777
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:55,319
Oh.

778
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:56,152
Oh, Vicki.

779
00:43:57,941 --> 00:44:00,858
Come on, cheer up, Becks.

780
00:44:05,754 --> 00:44:07,162
She's insane.

781
00:44:31,662 --> 00:44:32,912
I'm so proud.

782
00:44:34,623 --> 00:44:36,526
I can't believe you actually came!

783
00:44:36,526 --> 00:44:37,940
These are my work mates.

784
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,606
This is Becky, say hi.

785
00:44:39,606 --> 00:44:40,927
Hi.

786
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:43,806
I can't believe you've
got all of these on.

787
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,858
Vick's chicks!

788
00:44:44,858 --> 00:44:46,063
Vick's chicks!

789
00:44:46,063 --> 00:44:47,980
Come on, drink, yeah?

790
00:44:54,088 --> 00:44:55,828
Who's gonna buy me a drink?

791
00:44:55,828 --> 00:44:58,662
Shots, shots, yeah, shots!

792
00:45:00,226 --> 00:45:01,101
Whoo.

793
00:45:20,912 --> 00:45:22,174
Hi.

794
00:45:22,174 --> 00:45:24,348
What are you
doing over here on your own?

795
00:45:24,348 --> 00:45:26,315
Getting them drinks, more drinks.

796
00:45:26,315 --> 00:45:27,406
Ah.

797
00:45:27,406 --> 00:45:30,278
Oh, hang on, let me get that.

798
00:45:30,278 --> 00:45:31,214
You sure?

799
00:45:31,214 --> 00:45:32,641
No absolutely.

800
00:45:32,641 --> 00:45:35,870
Look, I'm gonna put it on
expenses anyway, so yeah.

801
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,457
Thanks.

802
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:39,851
Well, I don't have
no idea what we're drinking.

803
00:45:39,851 --> 00:45:43,405
Oh, same again, cocktail,
colored, whatever.

804
00:45:43,405 --> 00:45:44,238
Same again.

805
00:45:44,238 --> 00:45:45,709
Colored.

806
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,292
Colored thingies.

807
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,253
Look how happy she is.

808
00:45:50,253 --> 00:45:53,087
Yeah, well, maybe she should
enjoy it while it lasts.

809
00:45:53,087 --> 00:45:54,730
Okay.

810
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:56,313
Sorry, that was...

811
00:45:57,249 --> 00:45:58,786
It's an engagement party.

812
00:45:58,786 --> 00:46:00,501
I know, it was selfish.

813
00:46:00,501 --> 00:46:04,668
Some things are not meant to
last, and I'm sure this is.

814
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:06,724
This is the one I'm getting.

815
00:46:06,724 --> 00:46:07,762
This is what I think I'm getting.

816
00:46:07,762 --> 00:46:09,184
I think I'm getting
this one, look at that.

817
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:11,018
Oh, that is so nice!

818
00:46:11,863 --> 00:46:13,179
Look at that, look at that!

819
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:14,766
Oh, it's gorgeous.

820
00:46:14,766 --> 00:46:18,861
350, that's how much
you've got to save, Scotty.

821
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:19,944
350 pounds?

822
00:46:21,353 --> 00:46:23,714
I'm never going to pay that,
I would never pay that!

823
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:25,157
Oh.

824
00:46:26,688 --> 00:46:28,332
Look, more importantly,
what are the chances

825
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:31,869
of me bumping into you
in town tomorrow, hmm?

826
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:34,341
Shall we synchronize watches?

827
00:46:34,341 --> 00:46:36,115
What do you say, 50/50?

828
00:46:36,115 --> 00:46:37,593
70/30?

829
00:46:37,593 --> 00:46:38,620
No, pretty low.

830
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,021
I'm looking after my
little brother tomorrow.

831
00:46:41,021 --> 00:46:43,201
I'm taking him to this
wicked place though.

832
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:44,838
I found this amazing place in Reading

833
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:46,169
that I've never been before.

834
00:46:46,169 --> 00:46:47,002
Yes,

835
00:46:48,174 --> 00:46:50,039
and that's it?

836
00:46:50,039 --> 00:46:51,220
That's all I'm getting?

837
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,667
Yeah, that's what you're getting.

838
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:53,957
Actually, he'll like it.

839
00:46:53,957 --> 00:46:56,353
All he does all day is sit on the sofa

840
00:46:56,353 --> 00:46:57,426
playing computer games.

841
00:46:57,426 --> 00:47:00,388
Finally, I think I found somewhere
that he'll actually like.

842
00:47:00,388 --> 00:47:01,486
You're not going to tell
me any more than that?

843
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,856
Oh, no,
absolutely not, top secret.

844
00:47:03,856 --> 00:47:05,173
See, now I'm intrigued.

845
00:47:05,173 --> 00:47:06,006
Yeah.

846
00:47:06,006 --> 00:47:08,103
Come on, Scotty, come on, take it off.

847
00:47:08,103 --> 00:47:09,277
What, no, no, no, I'm...

848
00:47:09,277 --> 00:47:10,218
It's my special day.

849
00:47:10,218 --> 00:47:11,056
No.

850
00:47:11,056 --> 00:47:13,430
Come on, come on.

851
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,621
You might like it, actually.

852
00:47:15,621 --> 00:47:16,454
Yeah.

853
00:47:16,454 --> 00:47:17,439
Yeah, it's quite cool.

854
00:47:17,439 --> 00:47:20,813
Spill the beans, come
on, where are you going?

855
00:47:20,813 --> 00:47:23,215
Look, I know I'm wearing a tiara, but

856
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,588
as your boss, I'm ordering you to tell...

857
00:47:26,588 --> 00:47:27,421
No, no.

858
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,349
You take your dress off!

859
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:32,038
You take it off, you.

860
00:47:32,038 --> 00:47:34,485
Scotty, Scotty, Scotty, Scotty.

861
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:35,818
Off, off, off.

862
00:47:37,338 --> 00:47:38,338
Take it off.

863
00:47:43,478 --> 00:47:44,978
Oh sweet, Jesus.

864
00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:50,005
You finally five, five available here.

865
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,005
No, no, no, no.

866
00:47:54,005 --> 00:47:54,838
No this,

867
00:47:57,372 --> 00:47:59,685
oh you gonna spank me?

868
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:06,645
All right, I'm keeping this party, what?

869
00:48:06,645 --> 00:48:08,895
Off, off, off, off.

870
00:48:10,606 --> 00:48:11,939
Off, off, off.

871
00:48:24,108 --> 00:48:25,965
Buddy.

872
00:48:59,264 --> 00:49:00,946
Look, have you seen this ax, here?

873
00:49:00,946 --> 00:49:01,779
Yeah.

874
00:49:01,779 --> 00:49:02,747
Look, how cool is that?

875
00:49:02,747 --> 00:49:03,580
Can you see?

876
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,308
There's that double ax there, right?

877
00:49:05,308 --> 00:49:09,960
That will go straight
through that horse's head.

878
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,244
Do you see that horse?

879
00:49:11,244 --> 00:49:14,204
And then they're fighting
with their bows and arrows.

880
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:15,239
Look at all of them there.

881
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:16,656
Did you see that?

882
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:25,561
And here, right, do you
know who this guy is?

883
00:49:25,561 --> 00:49:26,394
King Harold.

884
00:49:26,394 --> 00:49:27,970
Yeah, exactly, King Harold.

885
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:28,803
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

886
00:49:28,803 --> 00:49:30,111
Don't do that Harold bit without me.

887
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,535
History lesson, history lesson.

888
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:33,563
Right, so they think this guy is Harold

889
00:49:33,563 --> 00:49:35,513
because of the arrow through his eye.

890
00:49:35,513 --> 00:49:36,679
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

891
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:40,596
But actually now we
think this one is Harold.

892
00:49:42,385 --> 00:49:43,704
Do you know what they did to him?

893
00:49:43,704 --> 00:49:44,537
No.

894
00:49:44,537 --> 00:49:48,502
No, chopped his head
off like that, right?

895
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:52,419
Disemboweled him and then
they, um, gelded him.

896
00:49:54,012 --> 00:49:56,311
What's gelded mean?

897
00:49:56,311 --> 00:49:58,728
To, uh, chop his balls off.

898
00:50:00,885 --> 00:50:01,718
Cool.

899
00:50:02,856 --> 00:50:06,580
The notion of overkill comes
into effect there, I think.

900
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,252
But we don't know, who knows?

901
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:11,098
It could be this guy or
it could be this guy.

902
00:50:11,098 --> 00:50:12,900
But I recon it was this one.

903
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,229
Yeah, I see.

904
00:50:14,229 --> 00:50:17,297
Absolute bloody carnage is what it is.

905
00:50:17,297 --> 00:50:19,495
Yeah, it's pretty cool though.

906
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:24,374
It's like the 1066
equivalent of a computer game.

907
00:50:24,374 --> 00:50:27,055
Better than a computer game, you recon?

908
00:50:27,055 --> 00:50:27,929
Yeah.

909
00:50:27,929 --> 00:50:28,809
Yeah.

910
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:30,116
You just have to add
your own sound effects

911
00:50:30,116 --> 00:50:31,914
and stuff, that's all.

912
00:50:31,914 --> 00:50:33,248
Go ching, ching.

913
00:50:38,855 --> 00:50:39,948
Words to that effect.

914
00:50:39,948 --> 00:50:40,781
Mm hmm.

915
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:44,916
Ah, Woodley.

916
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:49,417
So good, they named it once.

917
00:50:49,417 --> 00:50:50,990
Have you been here before?

918
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,915
I have, I have, I have.
I know Woodley, actually.

919
00:50:54,915 --> 00:50:59,083
I grew up in a state very
similar to this, actually.

920
00:51:00,192 --> 00:51:02,207
It's not much,
but we like it, most of it.

921
00:51:02,207 --> 00:51:06,374
Yeah, it is what it is.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

922
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,500
In fact, my first
girlfriend was from Woodley.

923
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,667
I was 12, and she tasted of lollipops.

924
00:51:20,982 --> 00:51:22,732
Five Oak, how's that?

925
00:51:24,201 --> 00:51:25,525
Thank you, perfect.

926
00:51:25,525 --> 00:51:27,510
Come on, Olly.

927
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:28,937
Thanks Steve.

928
00:51:28,937 --> 00:51:29,980
My pleasure, sir.

929
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,094
You have a cool car.

930
00:51:31,094 --> 00:51:32,594
Well, thank you.

931
00:51:33,773 --> 00:51:35,322
It's not actually my
car, it's the company's

932
00:51:35,322 --> 00:51:37,653
but I'll take the compliment.

933
00:51:37,653 --> 00:51:40,020
Olly, let me give you the
keys to go and open the house.

934
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:42,133
Can't I stay with you?

935
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:45,801
No, no, just and go
and get some biscuits.

936
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:48,740
He's a good kid.

937
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,323
Yeah, yeah he is.

938
00:51:51,915 --> 00:51:53,299
I, I should get going.

939
00:51:53,299 --> 00:51:55,835
Actually, I've got some
friends coming over.

940
00:51:55,835 --> 00:51:56,953
I'm doing a bit of cooking for them,

941
00:51:56,953 --> 00:51:58,244
and as rock and roll as it sounds,

942
00:51:58,244 --> 00:52:00,411
I need to soak some beans.

943
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:02,455
Okay.

944
00:52:03,451 --> 00:52:06,595
Maybe we should do something
next weekend, if you're free.

945
00:52:06,595 --> 00:52:09,429
Yeah, that would be really nice.

946
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:12,275
I mean, I could cook
for you, if you want.

947
00:52:12,275 --> 00:52:13,804
How about that?

948
00:52:13,804 --> 00:52:17,349
I'm quite a good cook, if I say so myself.

949
00:52:17,349 --> 00:52:19,843
Proof's the pudding, so.

950
00:52:19,843 --> 00:52:22,166
I've seen your place, maybe
you can come around to mine.

951
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,473
How about that?

952
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:25,017
Cool.

953
00:52:39,896 --> 00:52:41,294
Was it too much?

954
00:52:41,294 --> 00:52:42,127
Mm mm.

955
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:45,975
I'm gonna just...

956
00:52:45,975 --> 00:52:46,975
You, yeah.

957
00:53:22,126 --> 00:53:23,959
Vicki, what's wrong?

958
00:53:26,212 --> 00:53:28,545
He bought a watch.

959
00:53:30,244 --> 00:53:32,337
What, a watch?

960
00:53:32,337 --> 00:53:35,364
We went away for the weekend

961
00:53:35,364 --> 00:53:39,307
and he didn't say
anything on the Saturday.

962
00:53:39,307 --> 00:53:42,745
Then it was Sunday, and
we're going out for dinner,

963
00:53:42,745 --> 00:53:44,495
and he comes out and,

964
00:53:47,673 --> 00:53:49,923
and he shows me this watch.

965
00:53:52,695 --> 00:53:55,570
He was never going to propose.

966
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:57,653
Oh Vicki, I'm so sorry.

967
00:54:04,042 --> 00:54:04,875
Okay.

968
00:54:08,563 --> 00:54:11,397
Good morning, Digital Marketing.

969
00:54:13,282 --> 00:54:14,365
I don't know.

970
00:54:17,051 --> 00:54:20,218
Can you just hold on a minute, please?

971
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,780
I'm so sorry about that.

972
00:54:37,447 --> 00:54:39,183
Comme ca, madam?

973
00:54:39,183 --> 00:54:40,016
What's that?

974
00:54:40,016 --> 00:54:42,644
Don't worry, it's got chocolate in it.

975
00:54:42,644 --> 00:54:43,589
Guys.

976
00:54:43,589 --> 00:54:45,426
Oh, thank you, Stevie.

977
00:54:45,426 --> 00:54:46,994
Ah, Scotty, almost didn't recognize

978
00:54:46,994 --> 00:54:49,700
you with your clothes on.

979
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,870
Mr. Kahn's renewed the contract.

980
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:52,870
Good work.

981
00:54:59,285 --> 00:55:00,632
Thanks, Steve.

982
00:55:29,956 --> 00:55:31,586
Yeah, yeah, we need to use the archers

983
00:55:31,586 --> 00:55:32,845
in a minute as well.

984
00:55:32,845 --> 00:55:33,678
Okay.

985
00:55:33,678 --> 00:55:35,351
Are you all right, Olly?

986
00:55:35,351 --> 00:55:36,184
Yeah.

987
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:42,689
You're from next door, right?

988
00:55:42,689 --> 00:55:43,676
Yeah.

989
00:55:43,676 --> 00:55:45,249
Hi, I'm Becky.

990
00:55:45,249 --> 00:55:46,415
Hi.

991
00:55:46,415 --> 00:55:47,474
What are you playing?

992
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:49,958
Battle of Hastings, it's really cool.

993
00:55:49,958 --> 00:55:51,196
Ah okay.

994
00:55:51,196 --> 00:55:53,925
Well, I'll leave you boys to it.

995
00:55:53,925 --> 00:55:55,926
If you need anything,
give me a shout, yeah?

996
00:55:55,926 --> 00:55:57,363
Okay.

997
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:12,576
At the harvest, keep back

998
00:56:12,576 --> 00:56:15,049
some of the best of your crop.

999
00:56:15,049 --> 00:56:17,726
The food grown with love
and served to the one

1000
00:56:17,726 --> 00:56:21,610
that you love will surely beget love.

1001
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:15,878
Wow, you look amazing.

1002
00:57:15,878 --> 00:57:17,128
Oh thank you.

1003
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:19,523
Welcome.

1004
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:25,145
Can I take your wicker basket thing?

1005
00:57:25,145 --> 00:57:28,719
Yeah, I brought some
stuff from my allotment.

1006
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:30,661
Okay, fantastic.

1007
00:57:30,661 --> 00:57:31,887
Well come in, come in.

1008
00:57:31,887 --> 00:57:32,720
Thank you.

1009
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,553
You found the place all right?

1010
00:57:33,553 --> 00:57:35,706
Yeah, fine, this is lovely.

1011
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:39,524
Now, do you like your wine sweet or dry?

1012
00:57:39,524 --> 00:57:41,416
Sweet.

1013
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:45,842
Okay, imagine you said dry
because that's what we've got.

1014
00:57:45,842 --> 00:57:47,813
Okay.

1015
00:57:47,813 --> 00:57:49,980
Prepare to be converted.

1016
00:57:51,057 --> 00:57:51,890
Okay.

1017
00:57:53,287 --> 00:57:54,120
Thank you.

1018
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,926
Have a smell of it
first, before you try it.

1019
00:57:55,926 --> 00:57:57,728
Just put your nose in.

1020
00:57:57,728 --> 00:57:59,329
All the way, go on.

1021
00:57:59,329 --> 00:58:00,164
Don't be shy.

1022
00:58:00,164 --> 00:58:01,942
Don't snort it, but just

1023
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:05,625
you know, get the aromas.

1024
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:08,429
- Mm.
- Nice?

1025
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:11,001
Are your taste buds going?

1026
00:58:11,001 --> 00:58:12,747
Mm-hmm, can I try it now?

1027
00:58:12,747 --> 00:58:14,499
You can, you
can definitely try it.

1028
00:58:14,499 --> 00:58:15,726
Okay.

1029
00:58:15,726 --> 00:58:17,241
Smell it first.

1030
00:58:17,241 --> 00:58:18,423
I have, I've smelt it.

1031
00:58:18,423 --> 00:58:19,427
And then the taste.

1032
00:58:19,427 --> 00:58:20,677
- Great.
- Good.

1033
00:58:22,311 --> 00:58:23,144
Mm.

1034
00:58:23,144 --> 00:58:25,280
Kaboom, brilliant, hand it back.

1035
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,292
Okay.

1036
00:58:27,292 --> 00:58:28,792
I'll fill it up.

1037
00:58:31,629 --> 00:58:33,260
You don't have to smell
it again this time.

1038
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,177
No, thanks very much.

1039
00:58:39,251 --> 00:58:40,668
Ah, magnifique!

1040
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:52,179
So you grew these beans yourself.

1041
00:58:52,179 --> 00:58:53,149
Mm hmm.

1042
00:58:53,149 --> 00:58:55,273
That's amazing.

1043
00:58:55,273 --> 00:58:56,505
They are delicious.

1044
00:58:56,505 --> 00:59:00,656
Oh, good, yeah, my granddad,
he gave me his allotment,

1045
00:59:00,656 --> 00:59:04,156
which I kind of look after and stuff, see.

1046
00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:06,970
Well, I think they're possibly the best

1047
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,226
beans I've ever had in my life.

1048
00:59:09,226 --> 00:59:10,365
Thank you.

1049
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:11,422
How's the fish?

1050
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:14,766
I don't normally eat fish very much,

1051
00:59:14,766 --> 00:59:17,099
apart from fish fingers, so.

1052
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:19,500
Right.

1053
00:59:49,313 --> 00:59:50,146
How's it going?

1054
00:59:50,146 --> 00:59:51,146
Yeah good.

1055
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:54,960
What's that?

1056
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,710
Just my little family heirloom.

1057
00:59:58,724 --> 01:00:00,139
I'm wondering how you might feel

1058
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:02,904
about a little Moroccan dessert?

1059
01:00:02,904 --> 01:00:05,654
Uh, yeah, I like Moroccan food.

1060
01:00:11,785 --> 01:00:13,452
Steve, what this is,

1061
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:17,323
oh my God!

1062
01:00:19,857 --> 01:00:23,525
Mmm, I literally haven't
smoked this since uni.

1063
01:00:23,525 --> 01:00:25,508
This is a really big bag.

1064
01:00:25,508 --> 01:00:26,885
Well, I don't smoke very often.

1065
01:00:26,885 --> 01:00:29,802
Just weekends and things like that.

1066
01:00:31,305 --> 01:00:32,681
Mm hmm.

1067
01:00:32,681 --> 01:00:33,514
No pressure.

1068
01:00:33,514 --> 01:00:35,014
No, no pressure.

1069
01:00:36,135 --> 01:00:37,302
Let's do this.

1070
01:00:38,988 --> 01:00:40,988
Let's do this shizzle.

1071
01:00:42,896 --> 01:00:44,481
That's what you say, isn't it?

1072
01:00:44,481 --> 01:00:47,481
I don't think so, not anymore, no.

1073
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:52,895
You know I've got to tell you,

1074
01:00:52,895 --> 01:00:56,011
I was really nervous
before I came here tonight.

1075
01:00:56,011 --> 01:01:00,206
We sat down, and you brought
out this fish, you know?

1076
01:01:00,206 --> 01:01:01,039
And I...

1077
01:01:01,923 --> 01:01:03,582
Golden curry, yeah.

1078
01:01:03,582 --> 01:01:05,545
Curry, I just, I was just,

1079
01:01:05,545 --> 01:01:08,128
I didn't like the fish so much.

1080
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:10,767
You didn't?

1081
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:12,539
Sorry, is that mean?

1082
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:14,328
It's just so like grown up.

1083
01:01:14,328 --> 01:01:16,661
There's fish and this sauce,

1084
01:01:17,571 --> 01:01:21,752
and this rice in like a shape, and I'm 25.

1085
01:01:21,752 --> 01:01:24,340
I normally eat rice in a bowl, you know?

1086
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,518
In a bowl shape, you put it in a bowl.

1087
01:01:26,518 --> 01:01:28,492
It was in a bowl shape, yeah.

1088
01:01:28,492 --> 01:01:30,169
I should've checked, I'm sorry.

1089
01:01:30,169 --> 01:01:34,348
It's all right,
next time, just no, no fish.

1090
01:01:34,348 --> 01:01:35,931
Next date, no fish.

1091
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,156
Next date?

1092
01:01:40,156 --> 01:01:42,467
This is a date, right?

1093
01:01:42,467 --> 01:01:45,744
I thought, yeah, I
thought this was a date.

1094
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:46,684
This is a date.

1095
01:01:46,684 --> 01:01:48,050
This is definitely a date.

1096
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:48,976
This is such a date.

1097
01:01:48,976 --> 01:01:50,181
You've come over to my flat.

1098
01:01:50,181 --> 01:01:52,912
You've lighted candles, this is a date.

1099
01:01:52,912 --> 01:01:54,472
This is a date,
I mean, that's a date.

1100
01:01:54,472 --> 01:01:56,555
This is our third date.

1101
01:01:58,926 --> 01:02:00,843
Uh, what, third date?

1102
01:02:02,739 --> 01:02:04,304
This is our third date.

1103
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,295
Where are you getting
the other two from?

1104
01:02:07,295 --> 01:02:10,213
Well, we went to like the museum.

1105
01:02:12,164 --> 01:02:13,950
That was such a date.

1106
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:15,726
You're brother was there!

1107
01:02:15,726 --> 01:02:17,185
It's still date.

1108
01:02:17,185 --> 01:02:20,315
And a large replica of a historically

1109
01:02:20,315 --> 01:02:22,232
significant embroidery.

1110
01:02:26,859 --> 01:02:27,692
That was...

1111
01:02:27,692 --> 01:02:28,590
Well, what
was the first date then?

1112
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:31,090
If that was two, what was one?

1113
01:02:32,238 --> 01:02:33,406
Record shop.

1114
01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:39,829
Jim was there, Jim the geek.

1115
01:02:41,534 --> 01:02:42,367
Jim was...

1116
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:43,579
Does Jim know it was a date?

1117
01:02:43,579 --> 01:02:45,986
Jim loved the date!

1118
01:02:45,986 --> 01:02:47,742
Jim had a great time.

1119
01:02:47,742 --> 01:02:49,864
You've spoken to
Jim about the date, have you?

1120
01:02:49,864 --> 01:02:53,504
I just knew I could see that
Jim was like loving the date.

1121
01:02:53,504 --> 01:02:57,832
Well, as long as Jim,
it was a date then.

1122
01:02:57,832 --> 01:02:59,832
It was a date.

1123
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:02,882
I'm not sure.

1124
01:03:02,882 --> 01:03:06,049
Three dates, my friend, three dates.

1125
01:03:06,945 --> 01:03:09,537
Okay, what does three dates mean

1126
01:03:09,537 --> 01:03:11,879
to someone of your generation?

1127
01:03:11,879 --> 01:03:14,629
Well, it means that I can stay.

1128
01:03:17,046 --> 01:03:20,297
Then this is definitely a third date!

1129
01:03:31,533 --> 01:03:32,616
Which side?

1130
01:03:34,514 --> 01:03:36,931
I tend to hand to the left.

1131
01:03:47,871 --> 01:03:48,954
Hey, oh okay.

1132
01:03:51,335 --> 01:03:54,335
That's the you're gonna roll, is it?

1133
01:04:12,524 --> 01:04:14,954
We can just lay here with
our clothes on if you want.

1134
01:04:14,954 --> 01:04:16,121
Hmm, mm hmm.

1135
01:04:17,942 --> 01:04:18,775
No, fun

1136
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:23,982
Let's take.

1137
01:04:33,117 --> 01:04:33,950
Glasses.

1138
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:48,089
Have you still got your boots on?

1139
01:04:48,992 --> 01:04:51,523
I didn't think you'd mind.

1140
01:04:51,523 --> 01:04:53,396
I kind of like it.

1141
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:16,600
Becky?

1142
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,101
Becky, you need to get up, I made you tea.

1143
01:05:22,648 --> 01:05:23,649
I can give you a lift in,

1144
01:05:23,649 --> 01:05:25,053
but I got a conference call at 9:15.

1145
01:05:25,053 --> 01:05:26,345
I can't be late.

1146
01:05:26,345 --> 01:05:29,930
Okay, can I have a shower and stuff.

1147
01:05:29,930 --> 01:05:33,206
Of course, yeah, it's all yours.

1148
01:05:33,206 --> 01:05:35,039
Can you pass my shoes?

1149
01:05:41,368 --> 01:05:43,118
Um, not those ones.

1150
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:48,404
Should be just around the side there.

1151
01:05:48,404 --> 01:05:49,237
Okay.

1152
01:05:53,071 --> 01:05:54,904
That's it thank you.

1153
01:06:02,067 --> 01:06:04,484
Okay, Death Star approaching.

1154
01:06:09,005 --> 01:06:12,244
I think this is about as close
as you'll want to risk it.

1155
01:06:12,244 --> 01:06:15,155
Do you mind if I drop
you on the corner here?

1156
01:06:15,155 --> 01:06:16,219
I know it's a bit weird, but...

1157
01:06:16,219 --> 01:06:17,657
It's fine, yeah.

1158
01:06:17,657 --> 01:06:21,124
Um, you can come around the back there.

1159
01:06:21,124 --> 01:06:22,906
You know, we don't arrive...

1160
01:06:22,906 --> 01:06:24,323
Okay all right.

1161
01:06:25,884 --> 01:06:29,023
I promise you, next weekend
will be amazing, all right?

1162
01:06:29,023 --> 01:06:30,690
Just keep the faith.

1163
01:06:31,886 --> 01:06:33,970
All right then, see ya.

1164
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:42,242
Actually, Becky, one more thing.

1165
01:06:53,772 --> 01:06:55,293
Okay, just go.

1166
01:06:55,293 --> 01:06:57,667
All right, see you in there.

1167
01:06:57,667 --> 01:06:59,250
See you in there.

1168
01:07:23,557 --> 01:07:25,018
That's disgusting.

1169
01:07:25,018 --> 01:07:26,690
Oh my God.

1170
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:27,767
What's going on?

1171
01:07:27,767 --> 01:07:30,100
It's fucking tortoise sex.

1172
01:07:32,704 --> 01:07:33,537
Listen to it.

1173
01:07:33,537 --> 01:07:37,037
Fucking hell, that's fucking ridiculous.

1174
01:07:38,852 --> 01:07:40,455
I really didn't expect that.

1175
01:07:40,455 --> 01:07:42,822
Look, look, look.

1176
01:07:42,822 --> 01:07:44,813
Oh, that's gross.

1177
01:07:44,813 --> 01:07:46,569
Oh my fuck.

1178
01:07:46,569 --> 01:07:47,491
That's horrible.

1179
01:07:47,491 --> 01:07:49,308
That's really horrible.

1180
01:07:49,308 --> 01:07:51,322
Look, look, look at.

1181
01:07:54,067 --> 01:07:56,234
That's really horrible.

1182
01:08:06,285 --> 01:08:07,118
Vicki!

1183
01:08:08,531 --> 01:08:11,663
Vicki, sorry to trouble you.

1184
01:08:11,663 --> 01:08:13,679
It's just I got a prospective
client on the phone

1185
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:15,334
who wants to know what
you're doing messing around

1186
01:08:15,334 --> 01:08:16,217
on the internet on a Monday morning

1187
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:17,605
instead of doing some work.

1188
01:08:17,605 --> 01:08:19,328
In fact, he'd like to
know what you're all doing

1189
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:21,681
messing around on a Monday morning

1190
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,853
instead of doing some actual work.

1191
01:08:23,853 --> 01:08:26,380
You should come look at
this, Steve, it's pretty funny.

1192
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:28,677
Oh, great, well, as
long as it's funny, Becky,

1193
01:08:28,677 --> 01:08:31,076
I'm sure it's all perfectly fine.

1194
01:08:31,076 --> 01:08:32,443
In fact, maybe you'd like
to do me a spreadsheet

1195
01:08:32,443 --> 01:08:33,940
about exactly how funny it is,

1196
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:36,798
and then I can take that to
the board meeting next month.

1197
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:37,631
No?

1198
01:08:41,627 --> 01:08:43,822
Maybe somebody wants to
clear up this kitchen area.

1199
01:08:43,822 --> 01:08:46,252
It's a fucking pigsty.

1200
01:08:46,252 --> 01:08:47,502
Sorry, Steve.

1201
01:09:15,086 --> 01:09:16,336
I'm so sorry.

1202
01:09:18,661 --> 01:09:20,230
It's all right.

1203
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:22,326
I didn't mean for you to
do the tidying up either.

1204
01:09:22,326 --> 01:09:25,089
I thought Scotty was gonna do it.

1205
01:09:25,089 --> 01:09:27,608
It's fine, honestly, I totally get it.

1206
01:09:27,608 --> 01:09:28,804
I'm really sorry.

1207
01:09:28,804 --> 01:09:30,800
Vicki, there she is!

1208
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,528
Listen, can I get a nice cup of tea

1209
01:09:32,528 --> 01:09:33,643
when you got a minute, please?

1210
01:09:33,643 --> 01:09:34,592
Absolutely.

1211
01:09:34,592 --> 01:09:38,759
Oh, and cactus juice for the
tortoise while you're at it.

1212
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:47,862
He's never angry for long.

1213
01:09:47,862 --> 01:09:49,779
That's why we love him.

1214
01:10:02,147 --> 01:10:04,601
Right, a half for lunch, who's coming?

1215
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:05,556
Where are you going?

1216
01:10:05,556 --> 01:10:07,460
Polish place on the corner.

1217
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:10,605
No, I'm taking him for lunch
after he won that account.

1218
01:10:10,605 --> 01:10:11,438
All right.

1219
01:10:11,438 --> 01:10:13,834
Come on big boy, it's on me.

1220
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:14,984
Becks, you coming?

1221
01:10:14,984 --> 01:10:18,317
Oh no, I've got a loads of work to do.

1222
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:52,673
Hi.

1223
01:10:52,673 --> 01:10:55,585
Um, sorry, I just, the others
have all gone out for lunch,

1224
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:58,843
so I thought I'd come in here and say hi.

1225
01:10:58,843 --> 01:11:02,345
Becky, you can't, you
can't just come in here.

1226
01:11:02,345 --> 01:11:05,638
Sorry, I, no, I checked the office.

1227
01:11:05,638 --> 01:11:07,837
There's no one else here, so.

1228
01:11:07,837 --> 01:11:09,306
We've been over this, all right?

1229
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:12,806
It's not appropriate, okay, I'm your boss.

1230
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:17,807
But, I know you are, Steve.

1231
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:20,891
But, you know, everyone else is gone.

1232
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:24,329
I just wanted to come in here and...

1233
01:11:24,329 --> 01:11:27,243
Becky, look, I know this
is difficult for you, okay?

1234
01:11:27,243 --> 01:11:29,068
But it's difficult for me as well.

1235
01:11:29,068 --> 01:11:31,068
We've got to have rules.

1236
01:11:32,492 --> 01:11:34,825
I don't really want rules.

1237
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:38,360
Becky, believe me,
I've been here before,

1238
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,465
and the minute this
becomes office property,

1239
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:44,456
it just becomes messy, okay?

1240
01:11:44,456 --> 01:11:46,702
That's not what I want.

1241
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:49,474
What do you mean,
you've been here before?

1242
01:11:49,474 --> 01:11:50,307
Okay, ah.

1243
01:11:53,762 --> 01:11:54,595
Right.

1244
01:11:56,214 --> 01:11:58,881
I don't get you, I really don't.

1245
01:12:00,113 --> 01:12:02,613
One minute, it's like amazing,

1246
01:12:05,137 --> 01:12:09,297
and the next, you're telling
me to get out of your office.

1247
01:12:09,297 --> 01:12:11,101
Becky, I just need you
to hang in there, okay?

1248
01:12:11,101 --> 01:12:13,184
Let's just get to the weekend.

1249
01:12:13,184 --> 01:12:15,351
We can talk about it then.

1250
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:22,470
I don't think that's gonna
work out for me, really.

1251
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:24,553
You're an incredible guy,

1252
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:28,010
but,

1253
01:12:29,998 --> 01:12:31,415
um, I just have...

1254
01:12:33,476 --> 01:12:35,809
Again, again, again, fuck.

1255
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,695
I'm sorry.

1256
01:12:42,695 --> 01:12:44,445
I hope, I just don't,

1257
01:12:45,573 --> 01:12:47,573
how is this gonna work?

1258
01:12:48,844 --> 01:12:49,677
I'm 25.

1259
01:12:52,048 --> 01:12:55,215
I want more than like sneaking around.

1260
01:12:57,868 --> 01:13:00,118
Becky, I'm sorry, I just.

1261
01:13:01,542 --> 01:13:04,181
I think I should probably go.

1262
01:13:04,181 --> 01:13:05,255
Okay?

1263
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:06,217
Becky.

1264
01:13:06,217 --> 01:13:07,200
No, I'm gonna go.

1265
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,033
Becky,

1266
01:13:08,997 --> 01:13:09,830
Becky.

1267
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:13,601
Becky!

1268
01:13:15,632 --> 01:13:17,299
Just please, just.

1269
01:14:39,622 --> 01:14:40,455
You all right?

1270
01:14:40,455 --> 01:14:41,325
Yeah, you?

1271
01:14:41,325 --> 01:14:42,158
Fine.

1272
01:14:43,227 --> 01:14:44,652
How's Carly?

1273
01:14:44,652 --> 01:14:46,043
Fine, how's Steve?

1274
01:14:46,043 --> 01:14:47,220
Fine.

1275
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:48,053
Good.

1276
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,096
Why'd you text me?

1277
01:14:51,096 --> 01:14:53,763
I just wanted to clear the air

1278
01:14:54,765 --> 01:14:58,933
about the whole Carly,
Friday night thing, you know?

1279
01:15:00,304 --> 01:15:01,137
Okay.

1280
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:05,818
Well, should we get a drink first, maybe?

1281
01:15:05,818 --> 01:15:08,081
Okay, one drink.

1282
01:15:08,081 --> 01:15:08,914
All right, one drink.

1283
01:15:08,914 --> 01:15:10,063
One drink.

1284
01:15:10,063 --> 01:15:10,963
Just one.

1285
01:15:10,963 --> 01:15:11,796
Okay.

1286
01:15:11,796 --> 01:15:12,713
Just one.

1287
01:15:14,342 --> 01:15:15,379
You all right?

1288
01:15:15,379 --> 01:15:19,074
Can I get a vodka coke,
and what do you want?

1289
01:15:19,074 --> 01:15:20,213
A pint, please.

1290
01:15:20,213 --> 01:15:21,446
And two Jagerbombs, please.

1291
01:15:21,446 --> 01:15:22,365
Thank you very much.

1292
01:15:22,365 --> 01:15:23,198
One drink.

1293
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:24,032
Two Jagerbombs, please.

1294
01:15:24,032 --> 01:15:25,297
One drink.

1295
01:15:25,297 --> 01:15:26,537
Mm hmm.

1296
01:15:26,537 --> 01:15:27,370
Okay.

1297
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:28,870
- Again.
- Another.

1298
01:15:30,189 --> 01:15:31,106
- Ah.
- Ugh.

1299
01:15:32,072 --> 01:15:32,905
Did you do it?

1300
01:15:32,905 --> 01:15:33,738
Mm hmm.

1301
01:15:35,626 --> 01:15:36,459
Gross.

1302
01:15:38,303 --> 01:15:40,796
So how on earth can you
be feeling like shit then?

1303
01:15:40,796 --> 01:15:41,797
What the hell is wrong?

1304
01:15:41,797 --> 01:15:43,684
Well, what's wrong with you?

1305
01:15:43,684 --> 01:15:45,581
Tell me about Steve.

1306
01:15:45,581 --> 01:15:46,699
Men are shit.

1307
01:15:46,699 --> 01:15:47,532
Men are shit?

1308
01:15:47,532 --> 01:15:48,365
Men are shit.

1309
01:15:48,365 --> 01:15:49,379
Women are pretty shit.

1310
01:15:49,379 --> 01:15:52,362
Women are not shit, men are shit.

1311
01:15:52,362 --> 01:15:55,106
I feeling shit because

1312
01:15:55,106 --> 01:15:58,789
I have been trying to get a
bike sponsorship for years.

1313
01:15:58,789 --> 01:16:00,342
A couple years ago, I fucked it up.

1314
01:16:00,342 --> 01:16:02,076
I got involved in this.

1315
01:16:02,076 --> 01:16:05,472
This drink and other
shit, and I ruined it.

1316
01:16:05,472 --> 01:16:07,267
I burned bridges, I ruined it.

1317
01:16:07,267 --> 01:16:08,567
Done, okay?

1318
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:09,400
Fuck.

1319
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,752
This year I have been
trying to build it back up

1320
01:16:13,752 --> 01:16:16,409
and to go back out there
and say, "I'm different."

1321
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:19,826
This week, I go in, and I present myself.

1322
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,561
I said, "I've changed,
this isn't me anymore."

1323
01:16:24,561 --> 01:16:25,978
No one wanted me.

1324
01:16:29,534 --> 01:16:30,367
Fuck them.

1325
01:16:30,367 --> 01:16:31,200
Fuck them.

1326
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,034
Fuck them.

1327
01:16:32,034 --> 01:16:34,533
I tried twice, and I failed twice.

1328
01:16:34,533 --> 01:16:36,754
You know how hard it is?

1329
01:16:36,754 --> 01:16:39,198
A whole year of my life wasted.

1330
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:41,208
No one wants me, no one wants me.

1331
01:16:41,208 --> 01:16:42,541
I'll have you.

1332
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,438
Put the money in, put the money in.

1333
01:16:50,438 --> 01:16:51,271
Money, money, money.

1334
01:16:51,271 --> 01:16:52,104
Choose, choose.

1335
01:16:52,104 --> 01:16:52,937
Uh.

1336
01:16:53,922 --> 01:16:54,893
Okay, good.

1337
01:16:54,893 --> 01:16:55,902
All right.

1338
01:17:37,621 --> 01:17:38,538
Trousers.

1339
01:17:39,532 --> 01:17:41,365
Okay, the same time.

1340
01:17:42,637 --> 01:17:43,471
Okay.

1341
01:17:55,764 --> 01:17:56,935
Is that a birthmark?

1342
01:17:56,935 --> 01:17:57,932
Mm hmm.

1343
01:17:57,932 --> 01:17:59,458
Cool.

1344
01:17:59,458 --> 01:18:03,680
Did you know that birthmarks
are actually the mark of kings?

1345
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,513
That's good to know.

1346
01:18:11,173 --> 01:18:13,090
I haven't got a condom.

1347
01:18:14,028 --> 01:18:16,041
I have a condom?

1348
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:18,979
Well, I didn't know I
was gonna come here with,

1349
01:18:18,979 --> 01:18:19,896
oh, fucker.

1350
01:18:21,773 --> 01:18:23,123
Maybe I can find a condom.

1351
01:18:23,123 --> 01:18:25,290
Maybe there's one I might.

1352
01:18:32,981 --> 01:18:36,172
I really, I don't have a condom.

1353
01:18:36,172 --> 01:18:39,672
So maybe we should just not have sex then.

1354
01:18:43,354 --> 01:18:44,557
Fine.

1355
01:18:44,557 --> 01:18:45,807
Fine.

1356
01:18:47,081 --> 01:18:47,914
No sex.

1357
01:19:11,658 --> 01:19:12,878
You all right?

1358
01:19:12,878 --> 01:19:15,938
I've got you a cup of
tea, if you want one.

1359
01:19:15,938 --> 01:19:19,936
I'm good, actually, for tea and stuff.

1360
01:19:19,936 --> 01:19:21,186
I've got to go.

1361
01:19:24,021 --> 01:19:25,485
I've got quite a lot of stuff to do today.

1362
01:19:25,485 --> 01:19:29,402
I lost track of time, I
lost track of the days.

1363
01:19:30,468 --> 01:19:34,641
This is why I shouldn't drink,
you know, I just forget.

1364
01:19:34,641 --> 01:19:36,058
Oh that's okay.

1365
01:19:37,052 --> 01:19:39,794
I had a really nice time last night.

1366
01:19:39,794 --> 01:19:41,877
So did I, I really did.

1367
01:19:43,543 --> 01:19:45,126
God, I'm trying to.

1368
01:19:46,013 --> 01:19:47,890
I remember most of it.

1369
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:49,473
I'm just, no, it's,

1370
01:19:50,523 --> 01:19:54,106
I'm just trying to get
the rest in my head.

1371
01:19:57,267 --> 01:19:59,850
That came out wrong, didn't it?

1372
01:20:03,629 --> 01:20:05,046
Sorry, no, I, um,

1373
01:20:07,373 --> 01:20:08,706
it didn't happen

1374
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:14,049
like I thought it'd happen.

1375
01:20:14,049 --> 01:20:16,765
That's the truth, I'm sorry, I,

1376
01:20:16,765 --> 01:20:19,539
I wanted it to be special, not quick.

1377
01:20:19,539 --> 01:20:23,456
It was too quick, and
it's my fault, I'm sorry.

1378
01:20:25,364 --> 01:20:27,879
I wanted to take it slow.

1379
01:20:27,879 --> 01:20:31,046
I wanted to take you on a proper date.

1380
01:20:33,262 --> 01:20:37,595
You know, get to know you
and see what'll happen

1381
01:20:37,595 --> 01:20:39,444
'cause you know I like you.

1382
01:20:39,444 --> 01:20:40,531
I like you.

1383
01:20:40,531 --> 01:20:42,531
I know, this is hard.

1384
01:20:45,804 --> 01:20:46,637
I think,

1385
01:20:51,662 --> 01:20:52,662
I should go.

1386
01:20:57,483 --> 01:21:00,041
You think I should go?

1387
01:21:00,041 --> 01:21:01,124
No, I should.

1388
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:03,734
I should go.

1389
01:21:05,051 --> 01:21:09,218
Maybe we could see what happens,
you know, in a couple weeks

1390
01:21:10,862 --> 01:21:13,195
when I get my head straight.

1391
01:21:15,795 --> 01:21:17,462
I'll see you Monday.

1392
01:21:43,601 --> 01:21:44,851
Mum, it's me.

1393
01:21:46,142 --> 01:21:48,975
No, I'm not okay at all, actually.

1394
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:52,930
I really need you to come home.

1395
01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:55,284
No, no, no, nothing's happened, I just,

1396
01:21:55,284 --> 01:21:58,617
I just really need you to come home now.

1397
01:21:59,650 --> 01:22:01,259
I can't do it anymore, Mom.

1398
01:22:01,259 --> 01:22:03,009
Just, just come home.

1399
01:22:04,006 --> 01:22:05,256
I've got to go.

1400
01:22:24,307 --> 01:22:25,307
I'm sorry.

1401
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:55,484
Sorry.

1402
01:25:00,324 --> 01:25:01,157
Excuse me.

1403
01:25:06,984 --> 01:25:07,817
Excuse me.

1404
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:20,512
Um, do you mind if I,

1405
01:25:24,575 --> 01:25:26,507
can I sit here?

1406
01:25:26,507 --> 01:25:27,590
Yeah, sure.

1407
