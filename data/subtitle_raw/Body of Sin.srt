1
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:32,336
This place is perfect, upscale,
not a meat market.

2
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,077
Full of married, successful men.

3
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:37,167
You always have to go
for a married guy?

4
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:42,042
If you can, because they usually
don't even report it.

5
00:00:43,869 --> 00:00:45,567
Don't you ever feel bad about that?

6
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,352
Lauren, I don't hold a gun
to their head, okay?

7
00:00:48,396 --> 00:00:50,006
It's their choice.

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,226
They're gonna do what
they're gonna do.

9
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:58,797
And if they're going to play,
they're going to pay.

10
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:00,495
You really need to get rid
of this conscience...

11
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:02,062
if you're going to do this.

12
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:05,717
I know, I just... I have a hard
time accepting that.

13
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:06,892
What?

14
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:09,069
Steal from people.

15
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:12,594
If you don't wanna to do this,
that's the door.

16
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:14,639
I owe you too much.

17
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:17,077
You don't owe me a damn thing, okay?

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,906
You're here on your own free
will or not at all.

19
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,476
Look, when the time's right...

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,784
and it's your turn, you'll do
just fine.

21
00:01:28,827 --> 00:01:31,265
And you'll see how sleazy
these men are...

22
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:34,137
and how they get what they deserve.

23
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:38,010
And who knows,
what we do to them...

24
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:42,580
sets some of them back on the
path of marital fidelity.

25
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,412
He's interesting.

26
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:51,285
Either he's new to town
or just passing through.

27
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,072
Well, h-h-how can you tell?

28
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,161
This place is for executive types...

29
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:59,815
and he's obviously not one.

30
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:01,425
No wedding ring, either.

31
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,036
So, uh, not what we're looking for?

32
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,256
Look again.

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,694
Gold watch, expensive leather
jacket, Italian jeans...

34
00:02:09,738 --> 00:02:11,392
and maybe a hundred-dollar haircut...

35
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:13,655
and he's really happy about something.

36
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:15,657
He can't keep that silly grin
off his face.

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,401
Which means...
he's looking to celebrate.

38
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:23,099
Yep, he'd like some company.

39
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:26,146
Oh, god.

40
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:27,451
Right there.

41
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:31,238
He just ordered a
twenty-year-old Scotch.

42
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:33,283
That seals it.

43
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:38,897
Hey?
What?

44
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,334
You got protection?

45
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,639
Always.

46
00:02:41,683 --> 00:02:43,467
Just please be careful.

47
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:47,689
This isn't exactly the first
time I'm doing this.

48
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:48,907
I'll call you.

49
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:49,952
Okay.

50
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:55,914
I'll have what he's having.

51
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,487
Mm.

52
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:05,315
Another one please.

53
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,621
It's on me.

54
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,188
That's not necessary.

55
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:11,147
Well, anyone who enjoys it
as much as you do...

56
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,453
it's my pleasure.

57
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:17,327
In that case... cheers!

58
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:18,676
Cheers.

59
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:22,854
Bartender, another round.

60
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:24,421
This one's on me.

61
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:26,858
Uh, no, I got this.

62
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:28,251
It's only fair.

63
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:31,341
I'm Scott.

64
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:33,169
Vivian.

65
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:38,218
I was thinking if we could go
someplace more... quieter.

66
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,717
I don't believe this.

67
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,719
You've never had a one-night
stand before?

68
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:05,332
Mm, not with anyone like you.

69
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,291
Let me tell you a little secret.

70
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:14,123
Now and then, every woman likes
to get a little... freaky.

71
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:48,984
Hey.

72
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:50,202
Hey.

73
00:04:50,246 --> 00:04:52,030
What are you doing?

74
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:53,423
It's time for me to go.

75
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,599
No, no, stay till morning.

76
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,079
It's already morning.

77
00:04:57,122 --> 00:05:00,169
No, look, I don't want you to go.

78
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:02,780
I think you're the perfect woman.

79
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:04,956
The perfect woman is a fantasy.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,135
So in a manner of speaking,
you're right.

81
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:12,964
I wish I could stay in town,
but I can't.

82
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:15,184
Damn.

83
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,710
I don't want this to end.

84
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:22,496
Have you forgotten the meaning
of a one-night stand?

85
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:23,845
Come with me.

86
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:25,934
What?
I mean it.

87
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,414
Where?

88
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:31,200
Do you want to sip Mai Tais
in Tahiti, huh?

89
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:32,984
Just take off with you?

90
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:35,944
Forget about my job, my family,
my friends?

91
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:38,381
I'll make it worth your while.
I'm serious.

92
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:40,078
Yeah, right.

93
00:05:40,122 --> 00:05:42,037
Yeah, you're right,
I'm just being crazy.

94
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,822
Thought so.

95
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,824
One for the road?

96
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,401
I'll never forget you.

97
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,316
I guarantee it.

98
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,475
Not bad.

99
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:36,091
Now, what were you looking
at in the closet?

100
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,620
Now we're talkin'.

101
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,339
Erica?

102
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:08,558
I'm almost done.

103
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,168
Bring the car around.

104
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,388
What took you so long?
I was getting worried.

105
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,912
I can't have a little fun
once and a while?

106
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,977
No way.

107
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:02,090
Oh, my god.

108
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,106
How'd it go?

109
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,282
What's that?

110
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:22,240
Early retirement.

111
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,372
What?

112
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:24,634
Drive.

113
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,333
Oh, my god.

114
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:14,292
How much do you think
this is worth?

115
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,817
If the quality's as good
as I think it is...

116
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,995
altogether, a million.

117
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:22,866
Probably more.

118
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,349
But who would leave a million
in diamonds in a hotel room?

119
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:29,917
Someone up to no good who needed
them close at hand...

120
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,135
in case he had to move fast.

121
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,963
Who's bound to come after us.

122
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:35,270
So? I was careful.

123
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:38,229
I'm always careful.

124
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:40,536
Well, he knows what you look like.

125
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:49,545
I like it.

126
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,591
Don't worry, we'll play it safe.

127
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,724
We'll head to the safe house,
lay low for a couple of months.

128
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:58,815
What do I always say?

129
00:09:58,859 --> 00:10:00,382
It's good to be bad?

130
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:01,862
So very good.

131
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,866
Hey, what's the matter?

132
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,476
Not another attack of conscience?

133
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,304
I'm just scared, Erica.

134
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:10,958
This is a little more than
stealing from a guy's wallet.

135
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:13,569
He's never gonna come after us.

136
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,225
You should be jumping with joy.
We hit a jackpot.

137
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:20,228
Come on, cheer up.

138
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,359
Let's go.

139
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:44,818
Henry. How you doing?
Erica!

140
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:46,863
What are you doing here, beautiful?

141
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:48,691
It's the wrong time of year.

142
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:50,301
I just needed to get away
for a while.

143
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:51,781
Uh-huh.
This is Lauren.

144
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,522
Oh, hi.

145
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:55,698
Better watch out, she'll get you
into all kinds of trouble.

146
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,613
Oh, don't I already know that?

147
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,659
You got me all wrong, Henry.

148
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,399
I guess you wanna make a trip
out to the island?

149
00:11:01,443 --> 00:11:02,923
If it's not too much trouble.

150
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:06,100
Well, you know,
it is such a long way aways...

151
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:09,712
and I'm not scheduled to go out
there 'til the end of the week.

152
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:13,934
I'm sure we can make some
arrangement, Henry.

153
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:17,807
Uh, let me help you
with that luggage.

154
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,983
Oh, thank you, Henry.

155
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,907
Welcome to Isabel Island.

156
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,996
This is really where you live?

157
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,042
When I'm not on the road.

158
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:40,003
To the locals,
I'm a divorcee from New York.

159
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,962
Erica, what?

160
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:44,791
We'll come up with your
back story later.

161
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:49,534
It may not look like much...

162
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:52,189
but it's the only real home
I've ever had.

163
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:04,593
Home, sweet home.

164
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,559
It's.. it's nice.

165
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:17,388
All the comforts,
even satellite broadband.

166
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,349
Spare room is back here.

167
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,924
What are you doing?

168
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:34,318
Searching for any news about
the diamonds.

169
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:37,452
You think he called the police?

170
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:39,628
Depends on where he got them.

171
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:48,463
What? What's wrong?

172
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:50,247
He's dead.

173
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,379
Who's dead?

174
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:53,120
Purcell.
What?

175
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:56,645
"Investigated, named Scott Purcell...

176
00:12:56,688 --> 00:13:00,692
"Found dead in his hotel room."

177
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:02,303
Oh, my god, Erica.

178
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:04,087
You think he's dead because
of us?

179
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:07,047
No. He was obviously involved
with some dangerous people.

180
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,700
That's nobody's fault but his own.

181
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:11,399
And what if those same people
just come after us.

182
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:13,053
We're safe here.

183
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:16,708
We didn't leave a trail.
We got away clean.

184
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:20,060
"The victim was last identified walking...

185
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:21,713
"Down the street with a blonde woman."

186
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:24,716
That's nothing, that's less
than nothing.

187
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,110
Nobody knows who we are.
Nobody's gonna come find us.

188
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:32,028
Oh, my god, he's dead, Erica.
He's dead.

189
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,251
Listen to me.

190
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:41,255
This had nothing to do
with what we did, okay?

191
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:45,476
What's done is done.

192
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,610
We'll stick together and get
through this, understand?

193
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:50,264
Mm-hm.

194
00:13:50,307 --> 00:13:52,875
And when this is over,
we'll go far, far away...

195
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:55,095
and forget this ever happened.

196
00:13:59,534 --> 00:14:03,103
I don't think I can forget
something like this.

197
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:05,845
You'll be surprised...

198
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:08,848
at what you can teach
yourself to forget.

199
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:43,317
We'll bury the diamonds
until we need them...

200
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,146
and get rid of the case.

201
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:48,148
Well, where are we gonna
put the case?

202
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:04,773
I know this isn't the most
exciting spot in the world.

203
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:07,994
I like a little peace and quiet.

204
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:11,127
Why did you pick me?

205
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:13,869
What?

206
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,089
Why did you make me your partner?

207
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,443
It's good to have someone
to watch your back.

208
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,575
And since I don't trust men.

209
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:26,055
You weren't my first partner...

210
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:29,232
but you could have been the best.

211
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,365
With a face and body like yours...

212
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:34,977
men would have lined up
to be ripped off by you.

213
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:37,240
It's too bad you didn't get
to try.

214
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:41,897
It's quite a rush in the beginning.

215
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,770
So this was just a business decision?

216
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,033
Not entirely.

217
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:52,952
It's good.

218
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:55,345
It's good you're getting out
even before you begin.

219
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:00,524
Before you turn into a cold,
heartless, bitch like me.

220
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,006
It's not who you are.

221
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:12,058
You're a poor judge of character.

222
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:20,066
You would have never made it
in this business.

223
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:42,088
Morning.
Mm.

224
00:16:42,131 --> 00:16:43,611
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.

225
00:16:43,654 --> 00:16:45,047
Oh.

226
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,396
Are you okay?

227
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,529
Yeah, I-I-I'm fine.
I'm fine.

228
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:52,185
I'm Mike Frasier, the, uh,
local peacekeeper.

229
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:55,840
Of course, if this place was
any more peaceful...

230
00:16:55,884 --> 00:16:57,842
they would all be asleep.

231
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:02,804
I didn't know they had, uh,
law enforcement on this island.

232
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,545
They didn't until recently.

233
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:07,635
Um, I transferred into the
Isabel substation.

234
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:11,030
Oh.
Your tax dollars at work.

235
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,857
Tourist?

236
00:17:12,901 --> 00:17:14,642
I'm just staying with a friend
who has a cabin out here.

237
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:17,210
That's nice.
How long are you staying?

238
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:19,081
Just a couple of months.

239
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,606
Wow... what job has that kind
of vacation plan?

240
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,304
Uh, hey, I'm sorry.

241
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:27,046
I'm not trying to give you the
third degree, just..

242
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,396
Just making conversation.
Oh, no.

243
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:32,660
I don't think I caught your name.

244
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:37,056
Oh, it's, uh.. uh, Lauren,
um, Lauren Hailey.

245
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:40,276
Pleasure to meet you, Lauren.
Maybe I'll see you around.

246
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,322
Yeah.

247
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,419
Who was that?

248
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:56,466
Uh, just some new sheriff or something.

249
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,425
What are we gonna do?

250
00:17:58,468 --> 00:18:02,211
Nothing. We're law-abiding
citizens, remember?

251
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:11,655
But, why did he come up to me?

252
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:14,702
Because you're the most gorgeous
thing around here on two legs.

253
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:15,833
Ugh.

254
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:17,661
Except for me, of course.

255
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:20,142
Aw! You.

256
00:18:20,186 --> 00:18:22,013
Oh, I'm just kidding.

257
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:25,495
No, it's, y-you're funny,
that's what you are.

258
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,541
Yeah, well, someone has to be.

259
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,133
Have you thought about what
you'll do...

260
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,569
with your cut of the money?

261
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:42,398
I don't know.

262
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:44,139
I'm heading to the Caymans...

263
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,750
to buy a little bungalow
on the beach.

264
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,665
You're welcome to come along.

265
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:51,494
I'll think about it.

266
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:54,280
Whatever you decide to do,
remember one thing.

267
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:57,108
Don't become attached to anything.

268
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:06,553
Want anything?

269
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:09,469
No, I'm gonna take me a bath.

270
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:11,253
In the middle of the day?

271
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,168
What's wrong with that?

272
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,215
That guilt you're carrying around,
won't just wash off.

273
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,673
Hi, there.
Oh gosh.

274
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:26,328
Sorry, I seem to have done it again.

275
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:29,331
I have a knack for scaring you.

276
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,290
What are you doing here?

277
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,335
Ah, just hiking around the island.

278
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,294
Getting to know the place.

279
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,687
Hoping to hell I didn't make
the wrong decision coming here.

280
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:39,602
Where's your uniform?

281
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:42,344
Uh, I'm always on duty, luckily
I don't have to wear the gun...

282
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:44,564
and the badge 24-7,
if I don't want to.

283
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:47,523
Which is a good thing, because
it is a bitch in the shower.

284
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:51,005
I see we're kinda heading
the same direction.

285
00:21:51,048 --> 00:21:52,398
Care for some company?

286
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:54,791
Sure.

287
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:57,403
You know, um,
I'm an amateur naturalist.

288
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:58,534
Oh really?

289
00:21:58,578 --> 00:21:59,709
Oh yeah.

290
00:21:59,753 --> 00:22:00,754
So see this thing over here?

291
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:01,885
Mm-hm.

292
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:03,322
We call this a tree.

293
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:04,366
Is it really?

294
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,759
Yeah, yeah.

295
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:07,674
Wow. I would have never known.

296
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:10,111
Thought about taking some day
trips out to the mainland?

297
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:11,808
I'd love to, but, uh...

298
00:22:11,852 --> 00:22:14,768
Erica says, we should probably
just stay on the island.

299
00:22:14,811 --> 00:22:15,986
Erica?

300
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,379
Oh yeah, uh, that's the friend...

301
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:19,294
I was telling you,
I'm staying with.

302
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,166
So do you always do everything
Erica says?

303
00:22:27,868 --> 00:22:29,783
I understand this is the highest
point on the island...

304
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,828
Old Fort Jackson.

305
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,439
You don't wanna get too close
to the edge...

306
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:35,223
'cause it is a long way down.

307
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:37,921
Oh. This has been really great
but, you know...

308
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:39,749
I should probably be getting
back.

309
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:41,272
Uh, yeah, yeah, of course.

310
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:43,405
You heard about that restaurant
over on Harbor Row?

311
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:45,973
I hear it's the best one
on the island.

312
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:48,367
I hear it's the only one
on the island.

313
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,065
True... true.

314
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:53,372
Anyway, I was, um, just wondering...

315
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:56,897
if maybe you'd like to try
it out sometime.

316
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,507
Okay, why not.

317
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:02,598
Then I'll take why not,
pick you up at 7:00?

318
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:05,427
I can't wait.

319
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,602
Walk me back?

320
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:08,648
Absolutely.

321
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:20,224
Have you gone crazy?

322
00:23:20,268 --> 00:23:22,226
I have got to get out of this cabin.

323
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,316
It's been a week already and
the walls are closing in on me.

324
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,972
I've gotta get out and get
things off my mind for a while.

325
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:30,757
With the sheriff?

326
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,541
He's a deputy.

327
00:23:32,585 --> 00:23:34,456
Oh yeah, that makes it okay then?

328
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:37,328
I'll be careful.

329
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:39,200
I'm not gonna change your mind,
am I?

330
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:41,028
Nope.

331
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:42,899
Stick to the back story.

332
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:47,469
Better still, don't talk
about your life...

333
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:50,298
and keep him away from here.

334
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:53,562
Look, I can handle it, okay?

335
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,390
Uh, I don't know about that.

336
00:23:55,434 --> 00:24:00,743
You still got feelings and
that's gonna get you in trouble.

337
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,174
Hey, Francine, how's it goin'?

338
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:42,132
What'll it be?Tequila.

339
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:44,047
Ooh... rough day?

340
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,889
Hey, who's the hunk?

341
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:02,022
I don't know, he came
in a few days ago...

342
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:06,069
but I do know he has
a very nice boat.

343
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:07,593
Interesting.

344
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,338
Think of a card.

345
00:25:14,382 --> 00:25:16,689
Got it.
Got it?

346
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:29,571
Queen of diamonds?

347
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:32,618
How did you know?

348
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,229
I know that I have a beautiful
queen in front of me.

349
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:39,755
And I also know that every queen
deserves to find her king.

350
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,846
Look, give me your hand.

351
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,589
Did you feel it?

352
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:48,851
Feel what?

353
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:51,593
Magic. Take a look.

354
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:57,773
Can I offer you a drink?

355
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:58,948
Who are you?

356
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,776
My name's Tom.
Erica.

357
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,735
Nice to meet you, Erica.

358
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,258
What brings you to Isabel Island?

359
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:06,216
Checking out some real estate.

360
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,957
Trust me, check somewhere else.

361
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,306
Do you live here?

362
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,134
Couple months out of the year.

363
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:14,224
Well, there must be something
you like about this place.

364
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:16,400
The privacy.

365
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:18,402
So a big developer that comes along...

366
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:21,667
is not exactly your idea
of a good thing?

367
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:24,495
I prefer the magician.

368
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:27,498
Really?

369
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:30,632
What do you do for a living?

370
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:33,156
I like to play with fire.

371
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,031
Oh, well,
I'm sure fire loves to play you.

372
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:47,997
Thanks for dinner.

373
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,696
I, uh,
I really enjoyed getting out.

374
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:52,523
So did I.

375
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:56,223
Thank you.

376
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:59,008
So, your friend...

377
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:00,183
Mm-hm.

378
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:04,884
Erica... you must be close.

379
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:10,324
You see, not too long ago,
I went through this really...

380
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:14,937
bad time and she really
helped me out.

381
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:17,374
You both from New York?

382
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:18,506
Yeah.

383
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:20,464
See, that's your problem.

384
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:25,556
New York is too big, too many
people, too many distractions.

385
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,210
You need a simpler lifestyle.

386
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:31,301
And, uh, how do you know
what I need?

387
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:35,131
Well, I know that you are a
very stressed young lady.

388
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:36,916
You're so wound up...

389
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:39,135
I'm surprised you're not
bouncing on the sidewalk.

390
00:27:40,571 --> 00:27:42,573
I-I don't know what you mean.

391
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:45,620
At first, I thought it was me,
that you get nervous...

392
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,015
hanging out with such a charming,
handsome guy.

393
00:27:49,058 --> 00:27:52,583
But somehow, I don't think
that's it.

394
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:58,720
You ask way too many questions.

395
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:01,288
And you don't like giving answers.

396
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:07,207
Lauren, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

397
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,949
Hey, hey, I got a big mouth,
all right?

398
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:13,039
I forgot, the goal of a first date...

399
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:16,477
is to actually make a good impression.

400
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,567
Is this a first date?

401
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,265
I hope it's not our last.

402
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:26,052
I want to get to know you.

403
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:30,273
And I think that might take a while.

404
00:28:30,317 --> 00:28:31,666
You're right.

405
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,799
Uh, about what?

406
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:37,933
I, uh, I do have something
bothering me.

407
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:41,894
But, I'm not going to tell you,
not ever.

408
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:46,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That is like a really long time.

409
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:49,945
Well, you're just going to have
to accept that.

410
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:52,295
Don't be so sure about that.

411
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:41,143
Well, I have to say, you're
something else.

412
00:30:41,187 --> 00:30:43,885
So I've been told.

413
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,974
You don't have to leave.

414
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:48,411
Yes, I do.

415
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:50,152
When can I see you again?

416
00:30:50,196 --> 00:30:53,982
Don't get any ideas.
This was a one-time deal.

417
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:57,116
Hey, I'm perfectly fine with that,
it's just that..

418
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:02,121
In that case...
I'll let you know.

419
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:41,160
Was it intentional?

420
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:43,945
I don't know. It could have
been a drunk driver.

421
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:47,427
You said no one could find us here.

422
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,865
I mean, you were gone for so long.

423
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,259
Yeah, I was just out having
a few drinks.

424
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:55,826
Alone?
With a guy.

425
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,524
What guy?

426
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:59,178
Some guy with a boat.

427
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:01,397
Erica.
What?

428
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:03,269
After all the grief you gave
me about Mike.

429
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:06,489
I can keep things from getting
serious, but you...

430
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:10,232
I see you like Mike and it's
gonna get us in trouble.

431
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,934
I'm going to bed.
Don't wake me up before noon.

432
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:09,596
Ow.

433
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:11,032
What's the matter?

434
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:12,468
Hurt my back last night.

435
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:14,862
Ooh, dodging the car?

436
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:17,169
Riding the waves with Captain Steve.

437
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:20,215
Oh, my god.

438
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:23,958
Oh, god no, here comes
Captain Love Struck.

439
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,178
Afternoon, ladies.

440
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:27,962
Mike.

441
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,877
What do you two have planned
on this lovely day?

442
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,533
Uh, nothing special.

443
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:35,361
Just another day in paradise?

444
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:39,408
You need to look up the word paradise.

445
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:43,630
Well, since you don't have
anything special planned...

446
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:46,633
today, maybe you'd like to do
something later?

447
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:50,028
Uh, I'll let you know.

448
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:53,248
Shouldn't you be out protecting
the innocent or something?

449
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:55,250
Are you saying you aren't innocent?

450
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:58,775
She's...

451
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:01,082
I think I'm gonna go.
Oh.

452
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:08,568
I'll call ya later.
Okay.

453
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:14,443
Last night, did you two...?

454
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:16,097
No.

455
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,969
You're gonna hurt him, you know.

456
00:34:19,013 --> 00:34:21,407
Like I care.

457
00:34:30,285 --> 00:34:32,113
Lauren?
Yeah?

458
00:34:32,157 --> 00:34:34,420
I want you to be real subtle
about this...

459
00:34:34,463 --> 00:34:36,683
but there is a guy across the street.

460
00:34:36,726 --> 00:34:39,120
I want to know if he looks
familiar to you.

461
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:43,690
I don't recognize him.

462
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,300
What are you thinking?

463
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:47,215
I don't know, I guess
I'm still seeing...

464
00:34:47,259 --> 00:34:49,087
those headlights coming at me.

465
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:52,786
Maybe we should leave the island.

466
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:57,617
You're saying you're willing
to leave your darling deputy.

467
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,881
Erica...

468
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:06,930
I know what we are
and what we've done.

469
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:09,498
I already know what
I signed up for...

470
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:14,677
and I have accepted the consequences.

471
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:20,901
I mean, it's never going
to be over...

472
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:31,129
because no matter what, we'll
always have some stranger...

473
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:35,524
looking at us, or we'll always
have to be on the move...

474
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:41,574
because we'll never be sure.

475
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:43,793
So my question to you right now...

476
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:49,930
is what do we do?

477
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:57,155
We stay put... for now.

478
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:58,808
Let's go.

479
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:27,141
What are you doing here?

480
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:32,190
I thought I'd surprise you.

481
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:35,062
I don't like surprises.

482
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:38,674
Well I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I had a chance.

483
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:41,329
I thought we had an understanding.

484
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:43,505
Anyway, how did you find me?

485
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:44,898
Well, it's a small island.

486
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,249
What do you want?

487
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,121
Well, I want many things...

488
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:56,039
but the question is what
do we both want?

489
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:59,086
This is what I get for messing
around in my own backyard.

490
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:01,262
You're not staying long.

491
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:03,351
It's up to you.

492
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:21,804
I hope that rated as a good
experience.

493
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:27,375
It was wonderful. You were wonderful.

494
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:40,736
Mike?
Yeah?

495
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,956
There's something I have to
tell you.

496
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:49,310
I don't think I'm gonna be
on this island any longer.

497
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:52,139
I thought you were gonna
be here a couple of months.

498
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:55,229
Erica and I, we decided to leave.

499
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:59,320
It's for the best.

500
00:37:59,364 --> 00:38:02,454
For the two of us, I mean.

501
00:38:02,497 --> 00:38:03,933
There's no chance it could've worked.

502
00:38:03,977 --> 00:38:05,631
You don't know that.

503
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:10,462
Yes, I do. I'm not the person
you think I am.

504
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:16,337
Mike, I have done some things...

505
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:18,383
Hey, it can't be that bad.

506
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:21,429
It is.

507
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:25,999
I take it this is the stuff
you can't talk about.

508
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:29,176
Lauren, look, whatever it is,
it's in the past.

509
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,221
Right?

510
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:33,920
Hey, I know you well enough...

511
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:36,401
to know that you're not a bad person.

512
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:38,446
I wish that was the truth.

513
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,752
But you won't let me help you.

514
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:41,797
Because there's nothing
you could do.

515
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:44,104
Not if I don't know
what the problem is.

516
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:55,420
I, uh, just want you to know
that I am..

517
00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:59,424
I'm really glad that we met.

518
00:38:59,467 --> 00:39:03,384
For the time that we have left
on this island, I really...

519
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:06,735
think that it's best that
we just don't see...

520
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:09,259
each other anymore, 'kay?

521
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:18,791
If that's what you want.

522
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:23,622
I think it'll just make things
easier for when I have to go.

523
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:44,120
Erica?

524
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:51,040
Erica?

525
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:54,957
Hello?

526
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:11,321
Erica?

527
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,902
Erica?

528
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:35,171
Um.. um, Tom, Lauren.

529
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:36,390
Lauren, Tom.

530
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,784
Hey how is going?

531
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:44,398
So you broke up with the deputy?

532
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,008
He deserves better.

533
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:47,357
Oh, come on.

534
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:49,142
Don't put yourself down like that.

535
00:40:49,185 --> 00:40:51,971
It's the truth.

536
00:40:52,014 --> 00:40:53,668
You'll thank me later.

537
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,367
Are you still angry about Tom?

538
00:40:57,411 --> 00:41:00,588
No.No?

539
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:06,159
You don't really care about him.
You're just using him.

540
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,947
Now you're getting it.

541
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:14,602
Don't ever let them
get close to you.

542
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:16,517
Never ever.

543
00:41:16,561 --> 00:41:18,606
Then you can forget them
and move on.

544
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,218
Erica, look.
What?

545
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:30,705
The current must wash around
here from the fort.

546
00:41:30,749 --> 00:41:33,752
Oh, my god,
we'll have to bury it.

547
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:39,627
Oh, my god.What?

548
00:41:42,238 --> 00:41:44,327
What is it?
It's a tracking device.

549
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,725
Someone could have tracked us here.

550
00:41:50,769 --> 00:41:52,031
What do we do?

551
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:54,860
I'll have to destroy it... now.

552
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:12,834
What do we do? Do we run?

553
00:42:12,878 --> 00:42:15,620
If someone knows we're here,
we've got to find out who it is.

554
00:42:15,663 --> 00:42:17,273
But surely if someone found
anything out...

555
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:18,797
he wouldn't necessarily
know it was us.

556
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,538
Oh, it would be easy to find out.

557
00:42:20,581 --> 00:42:22,931
We arrived right after the
diamond theft.

558
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:26,021
So, why hasn't he made his move?

559
00:42:26,065 --> 00:42:28,458
Maybe he already has.

560
00:42:28,502 --> 00:42:31,157
I want you to go online and research...

561
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,551
everything about your
ex-lover boy deputy.

562
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:35,335
Check his story.

563
00:42:35,378 --> 00:42:36,815
You can't be serious.

564
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:39,818
From now on,
everyone is a potential threat.

565
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,169
Check out Tom Shepherd as well...

566
00:42:43,212 --> 00:42:45,127
he's supposed to be in real
estate in San Diego.

567
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:47,652
Close the doors and windows...

568
00:42:47,695 --> 00:42:51,220
and don't let anybody in
and I mean anybody.

569
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,491
You look beaten down.

570
00:43:01,535 --> 00:43:05,060
How can the best and worst day
of my life be the same day?

571
00:43:05,104 --> 00:43:06,975
You want to talk about it?

572
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:08,455
No.

573
00:43:08,498 --> 00:43:11,371
Good, I get so tired
of pretending to care.

574
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:13,503
You want another whiskey?

575
00:43:13,547 --> 00:43:15,244
No, I'm good.

576
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,915
It's Deputy Frasier over on Isabel...

577
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:36,048
I need you to run a name for me.

578
00:43:36,091 --> 00:43:37,919
Erica Tate.

579
00:43:37,963 --> 00:43:43,446
Mid-twenties, 5'6",
could be from New York.

580
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,667
Yeah, any warrants or arrests.

581
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:50,018
Also, um,
run the name Lauren Hailey.

582
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:53,195
Yeah, mid-twenties.

583
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:55,502
Nah, take your time.

584
00:43:55,545 --> 00:43:57,852
Try all the databases and fax
me what you find.

585
00:43:57,896 --> 00:43:59,549
Thanks.

586
00:46:11,464 --> 00:46:13,292
About time you got back.

587
00:46:13,335 --> 00:46:15,598
What are you doing here?

588
00:46:15,642 --> 00:46:18,384
You surprised me yesterday,
I thought, I'll do the same.

589
00:46:18,427 --> 00:46:23,084
Magic, huh? You want more?

590
00:46:23,128 --> 00:46:26,653
Always.

591
00:46:26,696 --> 00:46:30,875
Well, I haven't even started to
show you what I'm able to do.

592
00:47:06,432 --> 00:47:08,608
What happened?
You've been gone so long.

593
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:10,828
Nothing, I got delayed.
What did you find out?

594
00:47:10,871 --> 00:47:12,960
Well, their backgrounds check out.
I found reference...

595
00:47:13,004 --> 00:47:15,658
on Mike working at the
sheriff's office in Phoenix...

596
00:47:15,702 --> 00:47:19,184
and Tom being a developer
in San Diego.

597
00:47:19,227 --> 00:47:22,317
That doesn't mean we can trust
them. Tomorrow we'll go out...

598
00:47:22,361 --> 00:47:24,885
and find out everyone
who's new to the island.

599
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:26,669
How?

600
00:47:26,713 --> 00:47:30,891
Strangers stick out on Isabel.
You need to get some rest.

601
00:47:30,935 --> 00:47:33,024
What about you?

602
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:37,637
I'm not closing eyes until
this is over.

603
00:47:49,736 --> 00:47:52,130
Hey, you, a bit early, isn't it?

604
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:54,088
I didn't peg you for a morning person.

605
00:47:54,132 --> 00:47:57,222
Who's arrived since I've been
here and stayed.

606
00:47:57,265 --> 00:47:58,876
Only the hunk.

607
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:01,226
No one else? Are you sure?

608
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:04,142
Wait a minute, there is this
other guy.

609
00:48:04,185 --> 00:48:07,797
He's only been in here once and,
I've seen him around.

610
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:08,929
Does he have a boat?

611
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:10,583
I don't think so...

612
00:48:10,626 --> 00:48:13,194
he came in the same day
Henry did the supply check.

613
00:48:13,238 --> 00:48:14,979
His name is Bill Teague.

614
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:16,545
What's this about?

615
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:19,418
It's about forgetting that
I ever asked.

616
00:48:19,461 --> 00:48:21,115
You got it, girl.

617
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:22,290
Thank you.

618
00:48:32,431 --> 00:48:34,259
His name is Bill Teague.

619
00:48:34,302 --> 00:48:36,957
He's the same guy we saw
from the café.

620
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:41,005
Erica, maybe no one is after us.

621
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:43,485
Maybe Scott Purcell put the
tracking device in the case...

622
00:48:43,529 --> 00:48:46,227
and not his killer.

623
00:48:46,271 --> 00:48:49,143
Are you willing to bet
your life on it?

624
00:48:49,187 --> 00:48:51,972
I'm gonna keep digging
until I'm sure.

625
00:48:55,106 --> 00:48:57,064
There he goes.
I want you to follow him.

626
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:58,718
Okay.

627
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:00,938
Don't let him see you,
I'll check his room.

628
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:02,461
Wait, how will you get in?

629
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:04,637
It's not exactly Fort Knox.

630
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:58,212
Lauren?

631
00:49:58,256 --> 00:49:59,431
Mike?

632
00:49:59,474 --> 00:50:01,041
We need to talk.

633
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:05,393
Uh, I'm sorry, w-we really have
nothing to talk about.

634
00:50:05,437 --> 00:50:08,875
Yes, we do... Erica Tate.

635
00:50:26,414 --> 00:50:28,242
Oh, god.

636
00:50:28,286 --> 00:50:30,070
She has quite the rap sheet
there, Lauren...

637
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:32,333
but I'm guessing you already
knew that.

638
00:50:49,481 --> 00:50:52,005
Now, I don't have any idea
what you've done...

639
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,485
but as far as the law is concerned...

640
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:55,487
there are open warrants on her.

641
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,967
Mike...

642
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:01,101
I told you I was not the person
who you thought I was.

643
00:51:01,145 --> 00:51:02,972
I don't care what happened
in the past, all right.

644
00:51:03,016 --> 00:51:05,627
All I'm worried about is
right now.

645
00:51:05,671 --> 00:51:10,763
Get away while you still can,
just walk away from her.

646
00:51:10,806 --> 00:51:13,679
Look, I don't know if you'll
believe me...

647
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:17,465
but I have already made the
decision to do that, okay?

648
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:20,642
Yeah, I believe you.

649
00:51:20,686 --> 00:51:22,427
I have to do something, okay?

650
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:23,993
I- I have to finish what we started...

651
00:51:24,037 --> 00:51:27,432
and I can't let Erica
do it alone, I can't...

652
00:51:27,475 --> 00:51:29,477
so just take this.

653
00:51:29,521 --> 00:51:33,046
Leave me alone, just, uh,
stay away from me.

654
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,309
From the both of us, okay?

655
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:06,427
I'm sorry. I-I lost him.

656
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:08,473
It doesn't matter, he's our man.

657
00:52:08,516 --> 00:52:10,953
There are photos of the night
I was with Purcell.

658
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:13,434
But how?

659
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:15,349
He had to be tracking Purcell
when we showed up.

660
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:17,090
And now he's tracking us.

661
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:33,498
We're gonna draw him out here,
get him away from the town.

662
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:35,717
You mean, kill him?
That's the only way.

663
00:52:35,761 --> 00:52:37,415
And what about when he goes missing?

664
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:38,894
We'll clear out his room.

665
00:52:38,938 --> 00:52:40,592
Leave some money on the dresser
to cover the bill.

666
00:52:40,635 --> 00:52:42,333
I doubt anyone will ever ask
any questions.

667
00:52:42,376 --> 00:52:45,771
Well, what if he has friends,
uh, families, partners?

668
00:52:45,814 --> 00:52:49,209
We'll be long gone, pick up
new identities on the way.

669
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:52,125
It'll be over.

670
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:56,564
I can't do this anymore.
I want out.

671
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:58,305
Lauren, I told you...

672
00:52:58,349 --> 00:53:01,395
the days of picking up guys
in bars are over, okay?

673
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:02,527
We'll have enough to..

674
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,311
I don't want the diamond money!

675
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:07,358
Look, I know you're upset, okay.

676
00:53:07,401 --> 00:53:10,839
But he came after us and he'll
keep coming until we're dead.

677
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:13,407
I am not running out on you, Lauren.

678
00:53:13,451 --> 00:53:16,671
Get down! Go! Go!

679
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:31,599
Go. Go!

680
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:41,000
What are you going to do?
Stay here.

681
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:02,674
Lauren! I asked you to wait inside!

682
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:06,634
I think I lost him.

683
00:54:08,201 --> 00:54:09,855
Let's get back in.

684
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,212
Did you see who it was?

685
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,563
He was too far away.

686
00:54:22,607 --> 00:54:24,913
I don't think he was trying
to kill us.

687
00:54:24,957 --> 00:54:26,785
What?

688
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:28,482
He was trying to scare us
thinking we'll grab 'em...

689
00:54:28,526 --> 00:54:30,005
and go and that's when he'll
get us.

690
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:32,443
You're gonna have to stay,
after all.

691
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:35,359
'Cause if you leave now, he'll
think you've got the diamonds...

692
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:38,100
and he'll go after you.

693
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:40,625
Wha.. what do we do?

694
00:54:40,668 --> 00:54:44,585
The plan hasn't changed.
We kill him before he kills us.

695
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:01,532
I'm going to keep an eye on Teague...

696
00:56:01,575 --> 00:56:03,272
we've got to be ready
the next time he shows up.

697
00:56:03,316 --> 00:56:04,404
Let me go with you.

698
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:07,407
It's easier to follow him alone.

699
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:09,496
Here.
Oh no, you take it.

700
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,020
If I miss him,
use it like I showed you.

701
00:56:12,064 --> 00:56:14,327
Please, be careful.

702
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:08,485
Hello?

703
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:10,530
[OM] Hey, it's Tom.

704
00:58:10,574 --> 00:58:13,315
Well, listen, I just wanted to
tell you that I'm leaving.

705
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,882
What?

706
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:17,711
I have to go back to San Diego.

707
00:58:17,755 --> 00:58:19,191
I'm sorry, my dear...

708
00:58:19,234 --> 00:58:21,062
I didn't want to go
without saying goodbye.

709
00:58:21,106 --> 00:58:24,892
It was fun, Erica,
we had some laughs.

710
00:58:24,936 --> 00:58:26,720
So did I.

711
00:58:26,764 --> 00:58:29,854
Hey, I promise you next time
I'll be back, I'll look you up.

712
00:58:29,897 --> 00:58:32,509
You do that.

713
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:34,685
See you soon, baby.

714
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,840
Mike, you shouldn't be here.

715
00:59:42,883 --> 00:59:46,147
I just found these a couple
yards from the cabin.

716
00:59:46,191 --> 00:59:47,758
They'd just been fired.

717
00:59:47,801 --> 00:59:49,760
You wanna tell me what the
hell's going on?

718
00:59:49,803 --> 00:59:53,198
Can't you just leave me alone?

719
00:59:53,241 --> 00:59:55,287
Where's Erica?
She's not here.

720
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:56,636
Okay, I want to talk to her.

721
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,334
No, you'll only make things worse.

722
00:59:59,378 --> 01:00:01,946
I can help you.

723
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:06,385
You can't help me and still be
the person that you are.

724
01:00:06,428 --> 01:00:08,474
Lauren, look...

725
01:00:08,517 --> 01:00:11,869
just forget that I'm a deputy
sheriff, all right?

726
01:00:11,912 --> 01:00:15,220
Whatever trouble it is, my only
concern is for you.

727
01:00:15,263 --> 01:00:18,005
Look, if you really have
feelings for me...

728
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:21,530
please just don't get involved
in this.

729
01:00:25,447 --> 01:00:28,625
I-I gotta take this.

730
01:00:28,668 --> 01:00:31,497
Deputy Frasier.

731
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,152
What?

732
01:00:34,195 --> 01:00:35,370
'Kay, calm down.

733
01:00:35,414 --> 01:00:37,895
How badly are you hurt?

734
01:00:37,938 --> 01:00:39,287
Hello?

735
01:00:41,246 --> 01:00:44,858
Some hiker's hurt himself
out at Fort Jackson.

736
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:46,730
Look, I gotta go,
but I'll be back, okay?

737
01:00:59,394 --> 01:01:01,179
Erica!

738
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:04,138
I'm outside the motel, but I
haven't seen any sign of Teague.

739
01:01:04,182 --> 01:01:05,662
So be on the lookout.

740
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:06,793
Mike came by.

741
01:01:06,837 --> 01:01:08,490
What did he want?

742
01:01:08,534 --> 01:01:10,318
He wants to talk to you,
he knows something is wrong.

743
01:01:10,362 --> 01:01:11,668
What have you said to him?

744
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:13,321
Nothing.

745
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:15,236
Things are getting way...

746
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,586
too hot around here, we'll have
to take our chances and run.

747
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:19,371
I'll head back.

748
01:01:19,414 --> 01:01:22,374
Get ready to move fast.
I'll call Henry for a lift.

749
01:01:53,187 --> 01:01:55,494
Hello?

750
01:01:57,104 --> 01:01:58,758
Hello?

751
01:02:00,847 --> 01:02:02,022
Hello?

752
01:02:17,995 --> 01:02:20,258
Are you ready?
I'm almost packed.

753
01:02:20,301 --> 01:02:22,042
Forget that, we have to travel
light and fast.

754
01:02:22,086 --> 01:02:23,827
We'll take the clothes on our
backs and the diamonds.

755
01:02:25,393 --> 01:02:27,134
What's that?
Uh..

756
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:31,269
It's Mike's SUV.

757
01:02:31,312 --> 01:02:34,011
What is he doing here?

758
01:02:34,054 --> 01:02:35,752
I'll deal with him, get ready.

759
01:02:42,889 --> 01:02:44,673
Deputy Frasier?

760
01:02:59,558 --> 01:03:00,994
Erica!

761
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:07,871
Erica! Erica!

762
01:03:12,310 --> 01:03:14,312
Erica!
Lauren!

763
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,432
Go!

764
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:08,975
Is he still following?

765
01:04:09,019 --> 01:04:11,021
I don't know,
but we need to keep going.

766
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,025
Hold it right there.

767
01:04:15,068 --> 01:04:16,853
Don't move.

768
01:04:23,947 --> 01:04:25,644
No, no, no, I..

769
01:04:25,687 --> 01:04:28,603
I'll give you the damned
diamonds, just let us go.

770
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:31,737
Wh-wh-what the hell are you
talking about?

771
01:04:33,565 --> 01:04:37,699
No, no, no, get back
to the cabin, let's go, go.

772
01:04:37,743 --> 01:04:40,746
Move! Faster!

773
01:04:42,095 --> 01:04:43,662
Who are you?

774
01:04:43,705 --> 01:04:45,925
You don't remember me, do you?

775
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:47,927
So how many has it been?

776
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:51,409
Dozens? Hundreds?

777
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:52,584
Oh, my god.

778
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:55,848
How many lives have you ruined?

779
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:57,894
Oh, my god.
That's right.

780
01:04:57,937 --> 01:04:59,460
Am.. am I coming back to you?

781
01:04:59,504 --> 01:05:02,115
Let me refresh your memory.

782
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:05,162
Saint Petersburg, Florida?
Three years ago?

783
01:05:05,205 --> 01:05:07,425
I'm not good with names or faces..

784
01:05:07,468 --> 01:05:11,211
Bill Teague, pharmaceutical rep,
I was there for a convention.

785
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:15,912
I never cheated on my wife.
Never!

786
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:19,828
That's what this is about?
It couldn't have been that much.

787
01:05:19,872 --> 01:05:21,395
Get over it.

788
01:05:21,439 --> 01:05:23,789
When you left that night, yeah.

789
01:05:23,832 --> 01:05:28,141
That's right,
she found out what happened.

790
01:05:28,185 --> 01:05:31,144
Do you know what you took
from me?

791
01:05:31,188 --> 01:05:33,755
Everything!

792
01:05:33,799 --> 01:05:37,934
You took my wife!
You took my kids!

793
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:41,807
You took my job, you took my life!

794
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:45,593
Do you know the pain
that you caused me?

795
01:05:45,637 --> 01:05:49,032
Do you even care?

796
01:05:49,075 --> 01:05:51,904
Do you?

797
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,819
Well, I'm gonna make sure...

798
01:05:53,862 --> 01:05:57,692
that it never happens again...
to anyone!

799
01:05:57,736 --> 01:06:01,783
Move! Move.

800
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:03,611
Under there.

801
01:06:04,221 --> 01:06:06,614
Move!

802
01:06:06,658 --> 01:06:08,355
How did you find me?

803
01:06:08,399 --> 01:06:13,230
I saw you in Atlantic City
four weeks ago.

804
01:06:13,273 --> 01:06:16,494
Hair was different,
but I knew it was you.

805
01:06:16,537 --> 01:06:18,365
I've been following you ever since.

806
01:06:21,238 --> 01:06:23,457
But, why kill Purcell?

807
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:24,937
I don't know any Purcell.

808
01:06:27,157 --> 01:06:29,289
I've only killed one person,
so far.

809
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:32,727
You know, it was surprisingly easy...

810
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:34,381
when you have nothing to lose.

811
01:06:34,425 --> 01:06:36,731
What are you doing with Mike's SUV?

812
01:06:36,775 --> 01:06:38,864
Won't be needing that anymore.

813
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:42,259
No... no.

814
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:44,043
You're lying.

815
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:46,045
Oh, I would have killed
your lover, too.

816
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:48,526
But he got away before
I could get to it.

817
01:06:48,569 --> 01:06:50,006
You sick freak.

818
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:53,748
I wanted you to feel the loss
that I felt.

819
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:57,448
Take everything from you,
like you took everything from me.

820
01:06:57,491 --> 01:07:02,409
I think I did your wife a favor.

821
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,416
Move!

822
01:07:13,681 --> 01:07:15,553
I'll be back with a shovel later.

823
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:19,861
She wasn't with me then.
She wasn't a part of it.

824
01:07:19,905 --> 01:07:21,298
Well, she's a part of it now.

825
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:24,562
And you obviously care about
her very much.

826
01:07:27,695 --> 01:07:28,740
Answer it.

827
01:07:31,482 --> 01:07:33,614
Hello?

828
01:07:33,658 --> 01:07:36,791
I called for a boat earlier.

829
01:07:36,835 --> 01:07:40,012
You tell him that you won't be
needing it any longer...

830
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,449
but you know somebody who will.

831
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:47,454
Henry, there has been
a change of plans.

832
01:07:47,498 --> 01:07:51,371
I'm staying, but I know someone
who needs off the island.

833
01:07:53,678 --> 01:07:57,073
Yeah, he'll pay what I pay.

834
01:07:57,116 --> 01:07:59,292
You tell him I'll be there
in a couple of hours.

835
01:07:59,336 --> 01:08:03,514
Can you wait for two hours?

836
01:08:03,557 --> 01:08:05,690
He'll meet you at the dock.

837
01:08:09,302 --> 01:08:11,565
I can make you a very rich man.

838
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:13,132
Those diamonds I mentioned
earlier..

839
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:16,831
I don't care anything
about any diamonds.

840
01:08:16,875 --> 01:08:19,356
We're talking about millions
of dollars.

841
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:22,750
That can buy a lot of forgiveness.

842
01:08:22,794 --> 01:08:24,448
Think of it...

843
01:08:24,491 --> 01:08:29,453
you can rebuild your life,
your family, everything.

844
01:08:32,369 --> 01:08:34,066
I'll make the deal even sweeter.

845
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:37,287
All the money, if you let
Lauren go...

846
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:39,463
and you can do what you want
with me.

847
01:08:39,506 --> 01:08:41,856
Erica, no.

848
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,989
Shut up, Lauren, Bill's right.

849
01:08:44,032 --> 01:08:47,906
I've done some very bad things
and I deserve to be punished.

850
01:08:47,949 --> 01:08:50,909
No, I won't let you sacrifice
yourself for me!

851
01:08:50,952 --> 01:08:52,084
It's my life.

852
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,216
Erica, he's psycho!

853
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:54,652
So what!
Please!

854
01:08:54,695 --> 01:08:57,655
Shut up, you heard the man,
shut up.

855
01:08:57,698 --> 01:09:01,267
Shut up! Shut up, both of you!

856
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:04,009
Shut... up.

857
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:14,367
Tie him up.
I'm gonna get the rope.

858
01:09:14,411 --> 01:09:16,152
It's in Mike's SUV.

859
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:42,221
What are we gonna do with him?

860
01:09:42,265 --> 01:09:44,310
Oh, what do you think?
Oh, no.

861
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:45,964
Lauren, he's crazy.

862
01:09:46,007 --> 01:09:49,141
He killed Mike and he won't stop
until we're dead.

863
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,666
I am not going to have blood
on my hand anymore.

864
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:55,147
He knows all about us.

865
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,845
The police, the FBI, everybody
will be after us.

866
01:09:57,889 --> 01:10:00,021
I don't care.

867
01:10:00,065 --> 01:10:03,895
I'll go get the diamonds.
We'll talk when I get back.

868
01:10:35,143 --> 01:10:36,884
Lauren!

869
01:12:06,191 --> 01:12:09,977
Lauren! Lauren!

870
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,855
Tom?

871
01:12:17,898 --> 01:12:20,379
I understand you're a bit
of a con artist...

872
01:12:20,423 --> 01:12:22,381
but I'm pretty sure you were
not expecting...

873
01:12:22,425 --> 01:12:23,948
to be conned yourself, right?

874
01:12:23,991 --> 01:12:25,384
Where's Lauren?

875
01:12:25,428 --> 01:12:30,607
She's here, with me, on the boat.

876
01:12:33,218 --> 01:12:34,915
Let me talk to her.

877
01:12:37,004 --> 01:12:38,702
Talk to your friend.

878
01:12:40,225 --> 01:12:42,053
Go to hell!

879
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:49,800
Oh god, fuck! Fuck.

880
01:12:49,843 --> 01:12:53,456
I have what you want,
you have what I want!

881
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:55,893
Let's make an even trade, right?

882
01:12:55,936 --> 01:12:57,547
Where?

883
01:12:57,590 --> 01:12:58,765
On the boat.

884
01:12:58,809 --> 01:13:00,506
No.

885
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:01,638
Well, I'm not gonna do it...

886
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:02,856
in the middle of town!

887
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,336
Fort Jackson.

888
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,946
Where is it?

889
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:08,471
Lauren knows the way.

890
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:12,431
You've got thirty minutes.

891
01:13:12,475 --> 01:13:15,129
It's better for you if your
friend shows up.

892
01:13:15,173 --> 01:13:16,435
You know that?

893
01:13:20,744 --> 01:13:23,399
You fucking sicko.

894
01:13:39,284 --> 01:13:41,591
Toss the gun!

895
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:49,033
Slowly.

896
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,348
Stop.

897
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:03,003
You searched my purse.

898
01:14:03,047 --> 01:14:05,745
You checked my boat.

899
01:14:07,965 --> 01:14:10,663
It was you, all along.

900
01:14:10,707 --> 01:14:12,839
Magic, right?

901
01:14:12,883 --> 01:14:14,537
Where are my diamonds?

902
01:14:26,374 --> 01:14:30,640
Who are you? Tell me.

903
01:14:30,683 --> 01:14:34,426
Tell me or I swear,
I'll throw them.

904
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,603
You know, becoming your lover
was not part of the plan...

905
01:14:38,865 --> 01:14:41,520
but I did really enjoy it.

906
01:14:41,564 --> 01:14:44,088
Problem is that when I shot
at you at your home...

907
01:14:44,131 --> 01:14:46,220
you were supposed to grab the diamonds...

908
01:14:46,264 --> 01:14:49,528
and come running to me to get
off the island, but you didn't.

909
01:14:49,572 --> 01:14:52,488
Running to a man isn't my style.

910
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:56,187
Oh no, your style is stealing
from a man.

911
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:57,754
Who owns these diamonds?

912
01:14:57,797 --> 01:14:59,756
One of my men stole them from me.

913
01:14:59,799 --> 01:15:04,369
Purcell... you killed him.

914
01:15:06,284 --> 01:15:08,895
Now, give me my diamonds.

915
01:15:13,073 --> 01:15:15,206
Stay back.

916
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:17,991
Show me the diamonds are
inside there.

917
01:15:28,001 --> 01:15:29,612
Satisfied?

918
01:15:29,655 --> 01:15:30,830
Give it to me.

919
01:15:30,874 --> 01:15:33,267
Close enough.

920
01:15:33,311 --> 01:15:35,531
How much money do you think
I hold in my hands?

921
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:38,272
Twenty thousand? Thirty?

922
01:15:41,624 --> 01:15:46,063
Stop it! Stop it, for god's sake.

923
01:15:46,106 --> 01:15:47,847
How would you like
to lose them all?

924
01:15:47,891 --> 01:15:49,240
All right.

925
01:15:50,937 --> 01:15:52,591
Lauren, take the Jeep and go, now.

926
01:15:52,635 --> 01:15:53,984
No, please,
I'm not leaving you alone.

927
01:15:54,027 --> 01:15:56,900
You're wasting my time!
Give me my diamonds!

928
01:15:58,162 --> 01:15:59,598
Wasn't it all a waste of time?

929
01:16:00,991 --> 01:16:03,210
You saying you faked it.

930
01:16:10,827 --> 01:16:12,132
Erica!

931
01:16:18,748 --> 01:16:20,271
Erica!

932
01:18:00,763 --> 01:18:01,807
Hey, Tom.

933
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:03,461
Catch!

934
01:18:10,163 --> 01:18:11,425
Mike!

935
01:18:16,343 --> 01:18:18,215
Not so tight.

936
01:18:20,521 --> 01:18:23,263
Let's get you up, okay?
Okay.

937
01:18:29,313 --> 01:18:31,228
I heard everything.

938
01:18:31,271 --> 01:18:33,360
What happens now?

939
01:18:33,404 --> 01:18:37,538
Well, I call the Sheriff's office...

940
01:18:37,582 --> 01:18:40,716
and I report I was in an accident...

941
01:18:40,759 --> 01:18:43,675
coming back from Old Fort Jackson...

942
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,722
after discovering that someone
fell off the cliff.

943
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:48,549
Really?
Yeah.

944
01:18:48,593 --> 01:18:50,334
Thank you.
What about Bill Teague?

945
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:51,901
Who?

946
01:18:51,944 --> 01:18:54,381
That man that Tom killed,
who was also after us.

947
01:18:54,425 --> 01:18:56,122
I think he's going to disappear...

948
01:18:56,166 --> 01:18:58,951
along with everything else
in his motel room.

949
01:18:58,995 --> 01:19:01,214
Is there anybody else?

950
01:19:01,258 --> 01:19:02,738
That should do it.

951
01:19:19,885 --> 01:19:22,540
Ladies, I'll give you guys
a moment alone.

952
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:23,976
Thank you.
I'll take your bag.

953
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:25,717
I'll see you on the boat.
All right, baby.

954
01:19:29,068 --> 01:19:33,246
So, uh, I guess this is it.

955
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:35,727
I guess so.

956
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:40,123
What are you gonna do?
What I always do... survive.

957
01:19:41,298 --> 01:19:43,126
You could just go straight.

958
01:19:43,169 --> 01:19:45,041
I'll give it some thought.

959
01:19:53,136 --> 01:19:57,967
Take care of your lover boy
and enjoy your normal life.

960
01:19:58,010 --> 01:20:00,752
You're not supposed to get
attached to people.

961
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:04,712
Get going.
