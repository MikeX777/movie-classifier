1
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,560
I hate melancholic girls.

2
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,120
All melancholic girls do.

3
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,680
They wonder: How did I get to be
all I never wanted to be?

4
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,760
Yet the answer is clear.

5
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,160
I mean, just look at me.

6
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,840
Do you believe, looking like this
one could become anything else?

7
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,200
One can't take pity
on melancholic girls,

8
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,040
because they don't
take pity on themselves.

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,200
See? That's the problem.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,320
For example, if this were a film...

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,240
we'd already lose all those who
need to identify with the protagonist.

12
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,120
In a film,
something always has to happen.

13
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,920
Nothing ever happens
to melancholic girls.

14
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,560
I mean, they wander around,

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,120
they talk, they have sex.

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,720
But the crucial event,

17
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,160
the catastrophe,
has always already happened.

18
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,400
Now there's just inertia.

19
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,240
There are no climaxes.

20
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,200
No development.

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,280
No catharsis.

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,480
They don't become better people.

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,320
They don't move from A to B.

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,320
They don't jump off the roof.

25
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,520
One can learn nothing from them.

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,320
Except about the time and place

27
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,400
mirrored within them.

28
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,200
Because that is all they do:

29
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,200
They spend time in various places.

30
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,080
And then, at some point

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,240
the film is over,

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,160
just like that.

33
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,680
Are you asleep?

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,680
The way you're standing there
in your coat, I'll never forget that.

35
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,280
Oh, I think you will.

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,720
AREN'T YOU HAPPY?

37
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,320
EPISODE ONE
FEMINISM FOR SALE

38
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,480
I'll give you some music now
and you'll move sexily.

39
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,000
Got it?

40
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,640
Make moves on each other.
Make it sexier.

41
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,440
Okay.

42
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,800
Now the short one, you go first.

43
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,040
The camera is your mirror.

44
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,440
You apply make-up.

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Yes, that's it.

46
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,560
Re-do your eyes.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,120
Yes. Now:

48
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,560
Give yourself a flirty grin
in the mirror.

49
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,520
Looking good.

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,080
Cheekier, sexier.

51
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,160
And now you giggle!

52
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,000
Okay, louder, and now
burst into laughter.

53
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,000
Thanks. Now you.

54
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,560
The same again.

55
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,040
Look into the camera
as if applying make-up.

56
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,440
Touch-up your lipstick.

57
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,840
Now you check your make-up,

58
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,040
you wink at yourself. Sexy!

59
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,680
And you have to giggle.

60
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,160
Giggle!

61
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,680
Laugh more loudly.

62
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,840
Yes. Thanks. Cut.
Let's stay with you.

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,560
Know your lines?

64
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,080
So let's have your version.

65
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,320
The client wants it
as real and natural as possible.

66
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,920
Got it?

67
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,880
Hey, you! Yes, it's me.

68
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
Your wife.

69
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,360
Now listen to me.

70
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,240
I no longer want to be your
counterpart, or your better half

71
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,600
or a better version of you.

72
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,080
I no longer want to have the choice
between saint and whore.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,800
I want to be witch and girl,

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,720
bitch and lover, child and mother,
sinner and saint,

75
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,640
and all at the same time,

76
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,640
because I'm every woman.

77
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,920
And I never again want
to be asked

78
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,280
if I prefer the left or
the right-hand side of the bed.

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I want to be asked how I like it.

80
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,000
And if I say no, there are no

81
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,960
blurred lines.

82
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,800
But when I say yes, it means:

83
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,720
Yes! I want it! Because...

84
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,080
I'm every woman.

85
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,000
The new online store.

86
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,200
Okay. You're done.
Now your turn.

87
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,120
Hey, you! Yes, it's me.

88
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,000
Your wife.

89
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,440
Now listen.

90
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,320
I don't want to be your counterpart,

91
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,640
your better half,

92
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,200
or a better version of you.

93
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,360
I no longer want
to have the choice

94
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,160
between saint

95
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,080
and whore.

96
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,960
I want to be witch and girl.

97
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,720
Bitch and lover.

98
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,400
Child and mother.

99
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,440
Sinner and saint.

100
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
And all at the same time.

101
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
Because I'm every woman.

102
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,240
Could I get a happy version?

103
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,240
Or aren't you happy?

104
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,800
Sure, I'm happy.

105
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,800
Okay.

106
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,960
Then do it again happy, please.

107
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,840
Hey, you!

108
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,480
Yes, it's me. Your wife.

109
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,760
Now listen.

110
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,200
EPISODE 2

111
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,600
THE LONGING FOR RELIGION
IN DISENCHANTED PLACES

112
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,200
One, two, three, four,

113
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,480
five, six, seven, eight...

114
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,600
And kiss.

115
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,320
And now we come
to our final blessing.

116
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,400
Do join in!

117
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,480
But I don't have a baby.

118
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,560
Your birth

119
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,840
is my birth

120
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,000
You live through me

121
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,080
and I live through you

122
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,640
Your birth has changed everything.

123
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,200
Because of you I am a mother.

124
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,960
I feel the power of all mothers,

125
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,240
the power of Mother Earth,

126
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,440
and I am a strong,
independent woman,

127
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,280
who can achieve everything.

128
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,440
Your birth...

129
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,200
Welcome
to the new Biedermeier era.

130
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,960
Come on, it's not that bad.

131
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,720
It's worse.

132
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,560
You live through me

133
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,280
and I live through you.

134
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,080
Now I know what baby envy is.

135
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,480
It's interesting,
the kind of looks one gets.

136
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,200
- He suits you, anyway.
- Thanks.

137
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,920
Seriously,
you should have one, too.

138
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,360
It'd instantly cure your narcissism.

139
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,680
I tell you,
nothing grounds you like a baby.

140
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,720
- Back to nature?
- You're laughing.

141
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,280
It's pure fear.

142
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,840
Of what?

143
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,240
Children are the end of boredom.

144
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,840
The little one is the first
truly compelling event in my life.

145
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,160
Whatever works, eh?

146
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,480
I hope I never
have a baby out of boredom.

147
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,760
Why else would you have one?

148
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,520
To feed you?

149
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,920
To train it as a terrorist.

150
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,280
I recently saw a film
by Helke Sander.

151
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,840
The women in it
were more emancipated,

152
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,760
less oppressed and somehow
not as bloodless as we are.

153
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,000
What do you mean?

154
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,000
Say, can I sleep over at yours?

155
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,480
I have no home at the moment.

156
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,040
It's not convenient.

157
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,760
The little one already
messes up our routines.

158
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,400
In a few weeks,
when things have settled down.

159
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,920
Okay?

160
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,120
EPISODE 3

161
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,160
THE DAWN OF UTOPIA

162
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,480
Can you feel it coming?

163
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,440
Like a train

164
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,840
beginning to jerk.

165
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,720
The transition is

166
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,880
always difficult.

167
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,080
Are y'all

168
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,040
freezing too?

169
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,560
I love this weariness.

170
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,040
Can you feel the borders

171
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,280
dissolving?

172
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,240
As if one becomes less.

173
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,600
Layer

174
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,000
for layer,

175
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,040
one ceases to function.

176
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,960
This hand

177
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,040
doesn't belong to me.

178
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,120
That can't possibly be.

179
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,880
Do you think

180
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,360
we can

181
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,520
let go?

182
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,280
Do you believe
a better world is yet to come?

183
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,920
There won't be bodies anymore.

184
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,080
Our heads will have burst

185
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,320
from the velocity.

186
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,040
I read that there will soon be

187
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,640
a pill against feelings.

188
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,920
Humanity will consist of psychopaths.

189
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,240
They will be cold and happy.

190
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,520
Why is it so difficult

191
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,360
to dream something beautiful?

192
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,480
We have lost imagination.

193
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,000
But when?

194
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,080
In sleep.

195
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,800
EPISODE 4

196
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,120
THE VIOLENCE OF LOVE TALES

197
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,480
Will you do me a favour?

198
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,840
Will you shave my legs?

199
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,920
I'll do anything for you.

200
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,480
I'm scared of hurting you.

201
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,320
You can't.

202
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,680
That's a four-blade razor

203
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,600
with triple-protection.

204
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,360
Why did you come with me?

205
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,200
I needed a place to stay.

206
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,600
- That wasn't a joke?
- I never joke.

207
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,920
So... what do you do?

208
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,600
- I get my legs shaved.
- And in real life?

209
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,840
I'm writing a book.

210
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,480
But I can't get past the 1st sentence
of the 2nd chapter.

211
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,760
- What's the sentence?
- That was the sentence.

212
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,400
- It's brilliant.
- It's a crisis.

213
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,160
If I read your name on
a poster one day,

214
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,760
I will think: I knew her.

215
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,920
You hurt me.

216
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,520
Sorry! That was an accident.

217
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,920
And why me?

218
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,440
You were my man of the evening.

219
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,800
I always decide on a man
of the evening.

220
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,400
And what are your criteria?

221
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,400
Beauty,

222
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,200
innocence,

223
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,840
coolness.

224
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,480
Don't you even want to know
why I took you?

225
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,880
Well? Why?

226
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,000
Curiosity.

227
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,520
- I wanted to check out your breasts.
- And?

228
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,120
I like them.

229
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,480
Is that all?

230
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,200
Like the breasts of a French actress

231
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,280
or of a Greek goddess.

232
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,600
- Small and perky.
- Oh, a poet.

233
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,560
Why does your mouth
only spew irony?

234
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,480
It's not irony. It's cynicism.

235
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,360
What's the difference?

236
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,440
Ironists take nothing seriously.
Cynics are disillusioned romantics.

237
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,960
What am I?

238
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,000
- You're too young to be disillusioned.
- I know everything I need to know.

239
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,480
So, what do you know?

240
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,240
Better an awkward morning
than a night of loneliness.

241
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,120
That's just a quote.

242
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,560
- You quote, too.
- I quote myself. That's different.

243
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,400
Sing something for me.

244
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
- What?
- Sing me a children's song.

245
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,480
A little sailor

246
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,000
sailed round the earth

247
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,040
He loved

248
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,960
a girl

249
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,880
who had nothing of worth

250
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,360
The girl had to die,

251
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,400
and who was to blame?

252
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,360
The little sailor

253
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,160
in his foolish...

254
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,160
Oh, a spider.

255
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
Are you superstitious at all?

256
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,120
It is, despite everything,
a living creature.

257
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,920
Now it's your turn.

258
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,720
Once a boy a Rosebud spied,

259
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,400
Heathrose fair and tender,

260
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,720
All array'd in youthful pride,

261
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,360
- Quickly to the...
- Don't be silly.

262
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,200
I really like you.

263
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,200
You don't know me at all.

264
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,320
I see you.

265
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,040
You only see
the surface I hold before you.

266
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,880
- That's enough for me.
- See? That's my problem.

267
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,080
- What?
- I want to be loved.

268
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,520
But all I get is admiration.

269
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,200
Perhaps you go for the wrong ones.

270
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,280
That has occurred to me.

271
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,720
I can't do anything right, can I?

272
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,200
You can wash my hair.

273
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,160
That's better than nothing.

274
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,080
Don't you even want to know
what I do?

275
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,400
You wash my hair.

276
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,560
Sorry, that was a joke.

277
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,160
- What?
- Everything.

278
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,240
Isn't that sad?

279
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,640
- What?
- Well, this.

280
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,760
Us.

281
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,720
You're there and I'm here.

282
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,280
One goes in empty-handed

283
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,920
and comes out with even emptier hands.

284
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,840
- Why do we do it?
- Because we can.

285
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,920
Is it really that easy?

286
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,800
It could be different.

287
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,040
- How?
- I don't know. Like this?

288
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,920
This isn't working.
I'm stepping on your toes.

289
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,600
We aren't made for each other.

290
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,280
- What shall we do, then?
- What we were taught.

291
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,480
- I'm just a fool to you, right?
- You're a puppy.

292
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,000
You'd be a good prostitute.

293
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,280
You're so tender.

294
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,360
I pity men.

295
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,560
I pity you.

296
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,960
- That's a good starting point.
- For what?

297
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,080
For never meeting again.

298
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,840
EPISODE 5

299
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,840
OBJECTS OF DESIRE

300
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,680
Hello.

301
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,480
Hello.

302
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,800
What are you doing here?

303
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,960
I am standing around decoratively.

304
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,560
Somebody told me I was good at it.

305
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,960
You are humorous.

306
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,840
I never joke.

307
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,480
Excuse me, I am bad at this.

308
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,120
At what?

309
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,640
I prefer not to be more precise.

310
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,160
We could have a conversation.

311
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,080
With pleasure, about what?

312
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,440
Accelerationism
is a popular topic now,

313
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,680
or web series, or the refugee crisis.

314
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,000
But with that, it is difficult
to find the right tone.

315
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,320
Perhaps we could get
something to drink first.

316
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,640
What do we want
to converse about?

317
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,240
I don't know.

318
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,520
Can I sleep at your place?

319
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,000
If this is about sex,
I have to disappoint you.

320
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,560
I don't care about sex.

321
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,720
I have no home at the moment.

322
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,880
In that case,
you can gladly come with me.

323
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,040
If you like.

324
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,600
EPISODE 6

325
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,160
POST-EROTIC TIMES

326
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,960
Do you have anything to eat?

327
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,440
I am sorry, this apartment
is decorative rather than functional.

328
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,120
I always eat out.

329
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,240
A little neurosis.

330
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,240
Never mind.

331
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,840
What is your problem
with... sex?

332
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,720
Oh, that is a long story.

333
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,880
I have time.

334
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,280
Back then, I had a lot of sex.

335
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,880
Do you like Bataille?

336
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,320
I was absorbed by the concept
of excess and transgression.

337
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,360
I was convinced
it was the only possibility

338
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,480
to sincerely encounter somebody
away from the markets.

339
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,360
Then I was gay for a time.

340
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,560
Now I rarely have sex anymore.

341
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,000
I have to say, I am bored by it.

342
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,400
The professionalism

343
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,960
with which we do it.

344
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,720
It somehow saddens me.

345
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,800
I am the most sad

346
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,200
when the boy
makes a tidy knot in the condom

347
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,360
and puts it in the bin.

348
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,680
The perfect allegory.

349
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,800
What about you and sex?

350
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,080
My body is a war zone

351
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,160
where the entire world
stages its battles.

352
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,480
It is owned by everybody else
much more than by me,

353
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,600
so I can leave it
for free usage anyways.

354
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,600
The doubtful privilege of beauty.

355
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,040
I am instantly relaxed
knowing we won't sleep with each other.

356
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,640
Yes, me too.

357
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,080
- One could almost be tempted again.
- Yes.

358
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,600
But I have made a resolution
to take better care of myself.

359
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,480
Too many unprocessed experiences
will take their revenge.

360
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,840
Yes.

361
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,520
At age 30, depression strikes.

362
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,120
We could have a cup of tea instead

363
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,360
and watch a Woody Allen film.

364
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,840
Good idea.

365
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,240
Would you prefer the left
or the right-hand side?

366
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,920
EPISODE 7

367
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,040
DANCING SIMULATION

368
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
I am so bored.

369
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,040
I float through life like a fish

370
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,480
Everything slips past me, untouched

371
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,120
I hear myself speak

372
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,560
and wonder:
Hello, who is there?

373
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,200
I only have to sing a song or two

374
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,120
And the whole world's
dancing to my tune

375
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,480
Like playing ping-pong

376
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,120
In an infinite loop

377
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,760
And all doors are wide open

378
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,080
And I always find my way

379
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,840
I haven't met anyone lately

380
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,760
Asking why I do what I do

381
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,400
And everything feels the same

382
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,960
And I watch myself

383
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,800
And my laughter sounds so strange

384
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,320
And where the hell are you?

385
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,880
I just consumed you

386
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,640
That happens from time to time

387
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,680
Sorry, my life
is more exciting than yours

388
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,720
Let's just face it

389
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,200
I simulate self-confidence

390
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,720
And everyone stares at me

391
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,280
And I know as long as they stare

392
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,400
I can't stop

393
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,640
I imitate myself

394
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,120
EPISODE 8

395
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,680
THE ASHES OF PSYCHOLOGY

396
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,840
I dreamt last night

397
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,480
that I won a literature prize.

398
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:09,080
The German Banks' Newcomer Prize.

399
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,960
I sat on a podium

400
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,760
when the laudatory speech was held.

401
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,920
I remember every word of it.

402
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,000
"'A fluffy Berlin story',

403
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,880
one would think after reading the
first pages of her novel 'Yeah, Yeah'.

404
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,480
Young women drink latte macchiato,

405
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,080
go to therapy,

406
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,480
have pseudo-intellectual conversations
in art exhibitions

407
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,920
and meet their lovers.

408
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,920
Reduced to its reflecting surface,
the literary debut

409
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,440
by the 30-year-old,
delicate Berliner

410
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,240
is the chilly portrait
of a lost generation

411
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,960
for which neither
their parents' idealism

412
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,720
nor their grandparents' pragmatism
is an option.

413
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,600
They face the pressure
to be happy no matter what

414
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,320
with pretentious cynicism

415
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,120
and quotes from songs and films.

416
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:12,160
In its partly vain exhibitionism,

417
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,880
which is more than
a narcissistic pose,

418
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,800
the text is highly contemporary,

419
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,120
even explosive.

420
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,440
A debut,
cute like a rubber ducky

421
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,480
and evil like Jack the Ripper."

422
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,960
What comes to your mind?

423
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,200
It is not only the most brilliant thing
that I've written these last months

424
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,600
but also the only thing.

425
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,120
And that while dreaming.

426
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,360
Why do you think
you can't write right now?

427
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,800
I am bored by it.

428
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,800
In the tyranny of self-realisation,
everyone is an artist.

429
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,920
That's why the spirit of revolution
retired from art.

430
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,720
So, you deny yourself the right
to individual self-realisation?

431
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,600
If you want to frame it like that.

432
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,960
But what if you just look at all this
a little less ideologically?

433
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,480
Maybe, hidden behind
your political attitude,

434
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,520
is really a refusal to
get somewhere in your life.

435
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,000
If you really believe that,
I would have to assume

436
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,080
that you're mainly interested in
reconverting me

437
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,440
into a functioning part of society.

438
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,520
So, don't you believe you can

439
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,720
find your own individual happiness
in this society?

440
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,080
I don't even know

441
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,600
if I believe in individuality.

442
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,440
And I don't know

443
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,360
if I want to be happy.

444
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,200
When you talk like this,
I wonder sometimes

445
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,360
why you actually come here.

446
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,240
I wonder, too.

447
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
EPISODE 9

448
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,080
THE MARKET OF ROMANCE

449
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,000
Honey, why are you sitting
here all alone?

450
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,240
I am waiting.

451
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,320
For your prince?

452
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,800
That might take a while.

453
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,520
I am waiting
for the end of capitalism.

454
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,560
Then I'll wait with you.

455
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,960
- Do you smoke?
- Sometimes.

456
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,400
Do you have a boyfriend, honey?

457
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,560
I have boys and I have friends,
but I don't have a boyfriend.

458
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,000
You are funny.

459
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,920
Vasilis, could you come here?

460
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,560
You have to meet my friend.
She's hilarous.

461
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,560
- Hi!
- Sorry.

462
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,200
I have to pee.

463
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,520
- Did he bother you?
- Not at all.

464
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,960
- Do I bother you?
- We'll see.

465
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,800
You seem very cold.
Kind of stiff.

466
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,120
I guess you never really have great sex
because you won't be able to relax.

467
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,480
- Am I right?
- What do you want?

468
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,440
You know that I am a DJ.
I'm producing an album.

469
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,680
But only with the sound I recorded
during sex.

470
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,720
I got one track left.
Do you want to be on this last track?

471
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,560
Can I stay until tomorrow?

472
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,280
As long as you want.

473
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,000
EPISODE 10

474
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:48,320
NEW TOURISM
TAKES PLACE IN BEDS

475
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,680
Listen, girl. I wrote a song for you.
Especially for you.

476
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,800
Hey, girl, why are you so sad?

477
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,080
It's a structural depression.

478
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,560
I am unhappy

479
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,280
so that people like you
may be happy.

480
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,760
Do you think I should rather have a
baby or cut my hair and become fat?

481
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,480
Why?

482
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,080
So I will be taken seriously
before I turn 50.

483
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,480
You are great.

484
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,600
Do you like it here?

485
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,200
It's a fucking camp ground.

486
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:36,000
Everybody comes here,
dumps their waste,

487
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,800
and leaves again.

488
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,640
What?

489
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,840
Sorry,

490
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,680
I thought for a moment
you were somebody else.

491
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,120
But I am also a collective woman

492
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,320
and someone else every night.

493
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,720
So why shouldn't you
be someone else every night?

494
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,560
And somehow, we're all alike,
aren't we?

495
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,120
I'm bored to death.

496
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,400
I'm bored to death.

497
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,720
I have to go.

498
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,040
EPISODE 11

499
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,240
ONCE UPON A TIME...

500
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,600
Are you Blacky?

501
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,200
No.

502
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,880
Fips?

503
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,760
Homer?

504
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,880
Struppi?

505
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,720
Wolli?

506
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,840
Then you're Henri, okay?

507
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,880
I've been waiting for you.

508
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,000
Oh, really?

509
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,480
Why?

510
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,160
Is that forbidden?

511
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,640
No.

512
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,200
I'm not your type.

513
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,680
You are a 10, and I am at best a 3.

514
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,520
Not as sexy
as that Greek fellow up there.

515
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,600
Oh, well.

516
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,800
I'm not even really
a construction worker.

517
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,160
Oh, well. What are you, then?

518
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,360
Sometimes I am a pizza chef,

519
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,680
sometimes a paperboy,

520
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,680
sometimes a beekeeper.

521
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,160
Actually, I'm a philosopher.

522
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,680
An unemployed philosopher.

523
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,200
And a schmuck.

524
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,120
Inwardly and outwardly a bit desolate,
as you can see.

525
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,840
And you?

526
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,320
I'm a witch.

527
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,080
That's what I thought.

528
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,880
First, I thought you were

529
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,160
a fortress waiting to be stormed.

530
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,240
But now I see

531
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,480
that you're a war machine.

532
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,800
You destroy men and hopes, right?

533
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,520
Exactly.

534
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,120
Coming?

535
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,560
To do what?

536
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,240
To eat something, for instance.
Or read a book.

537
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,960
Or dance on the roof.

538
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,680
I have a dog now.

539
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,000
What's his name?

540
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,120
Henri. I just found him.

541
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,080
Okay, Henri.

542
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,560
You can come, too.

543
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,480
Come on.

544
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,600
Come on!

545
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,160
I wasn't expecting you.

546
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,040
We can have pasta.

547
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,600
Pasta with nothing

548
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,120
or pasta with garlic.

549
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,440
Pasta with nothing sounds good.

550
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,920
I just realized I feel hungry.

551
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Do you feel like screaming?

552
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,680
- Do I look like I do?
- To be honest, yes.

553
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,240
To be honest,
I'm not sure if I can scream.

554
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,880
I am a good teacher.
Come on.

555
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,240
Opposite me.

556
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,080
Arms up. Like boxing.

557
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,720
Bob and weave.
And now watch out.

558
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,280
Careful.

559
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,280
Now I scream.

560
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,280
Your turn.

561
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,280
Once again.

562
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,920
Mannometer!

563
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,480
Does anyone still use that word?
I learned it back in the 80s.

564
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,600
Finished!

565
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,240
I was wrong.

566
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,760
You're not a war machine.

567
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,960
You are a fortress
waiting to be stormed.

568
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,120
I am a house with open doors.

569
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,440
When I open my mouth

570
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,680
you can see my innermost being.

571
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,560
You probably think

572
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,480
it looks bad in there,

573
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,520
but I have to disappoint you:

574
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,280
Average and healthy.

575
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,840
You needn't tell me
anything about yourself.

576
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,840
I know you are as broken as me.

577
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,240
We could look after each other.

578
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:43,080
If we were together,
I'd have to judge you and your acts.

579
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,680
I'd have to tell you that
you're a poor, fat, old man,

580
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,760
and I'd have to say it with bitterness,
not tenderly.

581
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,920
That's just an excuse.

582
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,600
We want to remain lost,

583
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,960
therefore we cannot be together.

584
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,280
If we were together,

585
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,320
we would no longer be lost.

586
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,560
You want to remain lost.

587
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,000
I don't.

588
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,160
Maybe.

589
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,480
I have to go.

590
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,880
But you can sleep on the couch
if you want.

591
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,440
No. Thanks.

592
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,400
But you haven't eaten anything yet.

593
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,480
EPISODE 12

594
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,120
SOFT ASSAULT
DURING COFFEE BREAK

595
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,960
May I sit down briefly?

596
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,200
Yes.

597
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,760
What are you writing?

598
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,080
I'm writing a book.

599
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,800
But I can't get past the 1st sentence
of the 2nd chapter.

600
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,280
And what now?

601
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,160
Let's say,

602
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:14,640
I'm intensively engaging
with my non-writing.

603
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,080
I stopped making art.

604
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,160
Oh, really?

605
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,600
Eight years ago.

606
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,160
I kept repeating myself.

607
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,280
Until I met my master.

608
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,160
Your... master?

609
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,760
"Yoga of the Voice".

610
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,120
Has anyone told you

611
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,280
you radiate great inner calm?

612
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,440
That's an optical illusion.
Inside, there's a war raging.

613
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,480
Yoga of the Voice

614
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,600
is a sort of manual.

615
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:57,960
Use your presence, your awareness,

616
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,880
to concentrate on the question:
Who am I?

617
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,320
I've never concentrated
on anything else.

618
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,760
What you're talking about is just
biography, a stream of emotions.

619
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,160
Commonly known
as one's personality.

620
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,640
That is exactly
what you overcome via meditation.

621
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:21,520
You just listen to the heating,

622
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,360
liberate yourself
from emotion and experience,

623
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,680
and concentrate on the question:

624
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,680
Who is listening? Who is perceiving?

625
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,160
I'm sure you understand me.

626
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,960
You radiate an absorbing calm.

627
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,200
That's just my inner void.

628
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,400
The inner void.

629
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,880
Exactly.

630
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,680
I'm not so sure.

631
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,040
The acceleration of capital
degrades us into left-behinds

632
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,640
and we seek refuge
in mystic self-oblivion

633
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,360
just to better function again tomorrow
as even happier self-exploiters.

634
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,080
Sorry, today is my pessimist day.

635
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,280
You shouldn't talk to me.

636
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,280
I didn't want to sadden you.

637
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,720
Never mind.

638
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,880
You'd better go now.

639
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,480
My sadness might be contagious.

640
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,800
So you won't join me
for Yoga of the Voice?

641
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,240
No. And you know what?
I'll pay now.

642
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,320
EPISODE 13

643
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,200
PROMISES OF FREEDOM

644
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,000
There are no more buses tonight.

645
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,880
Maybe I'm not waiting for a bus.

646
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,560
What are you waiting for then?

647
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,320
For Godot. For my life to start.

648
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,600
For the night, for a text,
or for you: Pick one.

649
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,200
Who are you?

650
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,920
The girl standing at the bus stop.

651
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,760
You are funny.

652
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,280
I never joke.

653
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,920
So you're not Annika?

654
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,760
Do you have a date?

655
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,320
Well...

656
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,400
That's funny.

657
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,400
So what do we do now?

658
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,040
Maybe she'll show up.

659
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,680
Yes.

660
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,360
So, what do you do?

661
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,600
I'm a carpenter.

662
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,080
That's nice.

663
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,640
So down to earth.

664
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,080
Working with your hands.

665
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,160
Are you making fun of me?

666
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,960
I take pleasure in you.

667
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,520
Do you want to be invited
for a drink?

668
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,000
Most women
want to pay for their own nowadays.

669
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,120
I'd prefer a bed.

670
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,880
What?

671
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,160
I'd prefer a bed.

672
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,280
You're blunt.

673
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,800
We don't have time.

674
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,360
- Why?
- We're growing old.

675
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:42,760
We're still young, wild and free.

676
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,320
We have the freedom

677
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,560
to choose between beer and wine.

678
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,400
You have the freedom

679
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,480
to take me with you,

680
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,440
and I have the freedom

681
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,600
to let myself be taken.

682
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:10,520
We have the freedom or the duty
to sleep with each other.

683
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,800
Why?

684
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,320
Because we're so young and wild.

685
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,880
You're really funny.

686
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,920
I live right back there.
In case you were serious...

687
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,520
Why the look?

688
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,960
It always makes me so sad.

689
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,840
What?

690
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,560
Our professionalism.

691
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,400
But you are not a...
Are you?

692
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,960
Don't worry.

693
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,000
I don't take money.

694
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,840
Why did you sleep with me?

695
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,320
Because I'm so free.

696
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,320
I think

697
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,040
I don't get your humour.

698
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,680
The only freedom that I really have

699
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,800
is to fake an orgasm for you.

700
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,960
So,

701
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,920
did you?

702
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:04,280
Keeping the secret to myself
is part of the freedom.

703
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,160
You're mean.

704
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,560
Oh you poor, poor man.

705
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,800
Don't you worry.

706
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,000
It was a good performance.

707
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,280
Those are from my ex-girlfriend.

708
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,560
You have an ex-girlfriend with taste.

709
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,920
Thanks.

710
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,440
"I stand at the window
until my breasts feel cold.

711
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:54,920
Then I close the shutters.

712
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,040
I sit before a sheet of paper.

713
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,040
I drink Moscato Frizzante.

714
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:00,760
There is nothing, I think,

715
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:02,880
nothing but the performance,

716
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,840
nothing but the game.

717
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,000
Tomorrow, I want to be
called Monika, or Mara,

718
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,960
and I want to be happy.

719
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,080
I blow a snowflake
off the back of my hand."

720
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,800
Sentimental garbage.

721
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:27,120
"With every movement, Malte lets out
high-pitched, articulated moans,

722
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,680
his movements expressing
a well-considered eroticism.

723
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,480
He attends to her pussy
with dedication,

724
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,840
as if he were stirring risotto.

725
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,480
Eventually, Lore refused
the artificial gymnastics

726
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,920
and just laid there
in bed motionless,

727
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,360
while Malte was tending to her
with the most beautiful efforts.

728
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,400
She politely came every time
and then let him cum inside her

729
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:56,000
or worked his clean, small,
well-proportioned dick mechanically,

730
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,480
always with Malte's
shrill cries in the background."

731
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,920
"By qualifying the young
and the women

732
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:18,560
with an absurd surplus value,

733
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:21,120
by turning them into
the exclusive holders

734
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,400
of the new esoteric
forms of knowledge,

735
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,720
consumption and seduction,

736
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,120
the Spectacle has liberated
the slaves of the past,

737
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,640
but it has liberated
them as slaves."

738
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,960
Look, a book about me.

739
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,960
"Just as there isn't
chastity for the young girl,

740
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,600
there isn't excess for her either.

741
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,240
The young girl simply lives as
a stranger among her desires,

742
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:56,920
whose consistency is governed
by their Market-Super-Ego.

743
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,080
The boredom of abstraction
flows in the act of fucking."

744
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,080
You really are a curious one.

745
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,760
Like a very exotic kind of ice cream.

746
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,160
You can only stand a single scoop.

747
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,440
I'm going to write that
in my notebook, okay?

748
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,520
In my list
"Things men have said about me".

749
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,200
Are you a writer?

750
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,720
Something like that.

751
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,600
So, will I appear in a book now?

752
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,920
- Would you want that?
- Everybody does.

753
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,960
I'll see what I can do.

754
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,720
EPISODE 14

755
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,480
AN ODE TO SOCIETY

756
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,880
Are you still doing that

757
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,640
therapy?

758
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,160
Yes.

759
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,840
And?

760
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,040
I've started regarding my depression
as a political issue.

761
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,640
What does that mean?

762
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,680
It's not a personal failure,
but a structural problem.

763
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,960
I am unhappy so that people
like you may be happy.

764
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,640
Oh, come on.

765
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:42,480
I don't get
this archaic impulse to rebel.

766
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,720
Ever since I can think

767
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:48,080
I've been raised to critique
and rebel.

768
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:52,560
The society one could blame
no longer exists.

769
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,760
There is no exterior anymore.

770
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,360
That's why I wage war
against myself.

771
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,120
That's childish.

772
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,400
We can be anything, really.

773
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:09,240
Gays are no longer persecuted
in this country.

774
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,040
We live in an pluralist, open society.

775
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,360
That's why you're discontent.

776
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:17,000
The responsible citizen
is always discontent.

777
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:22,360
In this sense, your depression
is a sign of luxury.

778
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,480
You have to look at it that way.

779
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,960
Where are we actually going?

780
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,440
There's this new
ice-cream parlour.

781
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,640
While I wait, I can comfort my sore
soul with some consumption.

782
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,400
You're developing a sense of humour.
It suits you.

783
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:47,080
- What are you waiting for?
- Anger.

784
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,280
And what are you all waiting for?

785
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,320
Fourth floor.

786
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,240
AREN'T YOU HAPPY
