00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074


3
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,761
<i>Son las 06:00 a.m. 
y hay una mañana de primavera preciosa.</i>

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,720
<i>Parece que tenemos '
una gran anticipación de verano.</i>

5
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,910
<i>Y más noticias, tráfico y viajes 
para usted en 15 minutos</i>

6
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:42,363
<i>pero simplemente a caerse de la 
cama ahora mismo</i>

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,171
<i>aquí hay un franco garantizado 
para empezar a moverte esta mañana</i>

8
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,970
Buenos días, cielo. Cómo estás?

9
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,327
Sí, estoy de acuerdo. Cómo estás?

10
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,890
All right, Linford?

11
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,803
Ready? whoo!

12
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,721
Chop chop.
I've got to get back for a delivery.

13
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,360
When are you gonna get a new tracksuit?

14
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:24,924
- This is vintage.
- It's a relic.

15
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,241
- Well, you need new spikes.
- I'm broke.

16
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,444
Well, nail it on the weekend

17
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,727
and you'll have new spikes
coming out of your ears.

18
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,891
Come on, Linford!
Show her how it's done! Go!

19
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,920
All right, then, what's that time
gonna be on Sunday?

20
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:42,207
- Under 23.
- That's right, because then we...

21
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,410
- We qualify.
- Exactly.

22
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,926
World Champs, here we come.
Go on, then. Get ready.

23
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,045
Okay.

24
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,325
On the one!

25
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,128
Three, two, one!

26
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,283
Pump it! Push into the bend!

27
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,930
Good!

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,331
Bring it home, through the line.

29
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,530
- Still half a second off.
- You want more?

30
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,921
- I got more.
- Well, bloody well do it then.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,650
Stop wasting your breath.

32
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,802
- You're the boss.
- Yes, I bloody well am.

33
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,767
Linford! Get out of there!

34
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,963
Hey! Hey, Shania.

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,646
Come here.
Where's that sister of yours?

36
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,848
What? You tell me.
She lives with you, innit.

37
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,480
No, I heard she moved back in with you.

38
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:48,450
- Well, she didn't, so you heard wrong.
- Is that right?

39
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,560
Yeah, Daze.
Look, I don't have time for this, man.

40
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:54,444
If Tara knows what's good for her
she will call me. Today, yeah?

41
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,249
- You're gonna tell her that.
- All right.

42
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,004
- Good.
- Bye.

43
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,967
- Hey, make sure you tell her, yeah?
- I'll tell her.

44
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,844
- Sh...
- Don't answer.

45
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,520
I swear, if he calls me one more time...

46
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:24,090
- Tara!
- Don't start, Shania.

47
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,686
I got enough going on.
That man is driving me crazy.

48
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,640
I swear, if he comes
anywhere near me again...

49
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:30,115
Are you gonna turn that shower off?

50
00:04:30,116 --> 00:04:31,756
Why have you always got to give me grief?

51
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,608
Hi, baby. Hello, Auntie.

52
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,125
Not You, as well?

53
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,282
Look, please, just for a couple of days?

54
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,566
No way.

55
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,240
Please, Auntie P.
She can stay on the sofa with me

56
00:04:50,241 --> 00:04:52,481
and I promise that
we won't get in your way.

57
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,286
Fine, fine, fine.

58
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,610
Thanks, Auntie.

59
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,000
Thanks, Tyrell. Actually, yeah,
training was all right today.

60
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:05,201
Yeah, it weren't too bad, thanks.

61
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,243
- There she is.
- Good luck today, darling.

62
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:28,244
Don't waste the Luck, Mum
It's just for practice.

63
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,040
- Right.
- Just because you've already

64
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,281
been selected, doesn't mean
you don't need the practice

65
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:34,922
- or the luck.
- Sorry, Dad. Mum...

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,520
- Love you.
- Nice to see you, Ellie.

67
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,000
Hi, Lisa.

68
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,684
Hi.

69
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,445
Jane wanted to come and support today.

70
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,567
Great.

71
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,526
How's your mum?

72
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,167
Sorry, Jane.
It's a family tradition.

73
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,208
We always go quiet before a race.

74
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,120
It's part of the preparation.
Right, darling?

75
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,920
Come on, we're starting in a few minutes.

76
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:13,881
Is that Lisa Temple?

77
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,361
Shania, listen. Focus on your own race.

78
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,125
- Okay.
- She already got her slot.

79
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,480
If you run the way I know you can,
the last one's yours.

80
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,321
- All right?
- Yeah.

81
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,567
You have as much right to be here
as they do.

82
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,120
Now you go and show them that. Go on.

83
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,322
- All right. Take that for me. All right.
- Yeah.

84
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,088
<i>Ana' the next race is the
final' qualifier for the gb sprint squad.</i>

85
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,686
<i>With the World Championships
at the end of the summer,</i>

86
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,330
<i>only one place remains.</i>

87
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,847
<i>The fastest 200-meter time,
sub 23...</i>

88
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,809
<i>- Good</i> Luck.
<i>- ..Wife' take the 5,002'.</i>

89
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,201
<i>6000' fuck to them aft'!</i>

90
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,571
<i>Quiet, please.</i>

91
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,205
On your marks.

92
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,485
Set.

93
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,687
<i>Andrews in lane three, up with the leaders.</i>

94
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,081
<i>This is a fast opening quarter.</i>

95
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,846
<i>- Round the bend. Chapman in the feed.
- Yes!</i>

96
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,651
<i>Andrews is pressuring.</i>

97
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,171
<i>Twenty metres to go!
And Andrews takes the lead!</i>

98
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,686
<i>- Andrews if is!</i>

99
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,001
<i>- Shania Andrews made great time there.</i>

100
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,731
<i>She'll take the final' piece
in the gb squad.</i>

101
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,643
<i>- Congratulations, Shaina...</i>
- Yes!

102
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,768
<i>On a great race.</i>

103
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,683
<i>Joining local hero Lisa Temple...
- Whoo!</i>

104
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,720
<i>...- at the World Championships.
- - Who's that?</i>

105
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:51,245
Shania Andrews. Local girl.

106
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,687
And has she broken 23 before?

107
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,728
She's been building steadily all year.

108
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,883
Well, considering she missed
last year altogether, I'm impressed.

109
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,840
It looks like Lisa's got a rival.

110
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,126
That will be good for her.

111
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,921
Keep her focussed.

112
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,765
Take care.

113
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,007
Got yourself a winner there.

114
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,367
Sorry, Tommy Southern, GB relay coach.

115
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,124
Brian Johnson, shopkeeper.

116
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,328
Shop... Ah.
I thought you were Shania's...

117
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,050
Well, I give her a hand, you know.

118
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,169
How do you think she
would handle being on the relay team?

119
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,800
Why don't you ask her yourself?
Shania Andrews, Tommy Southern.

120
00:08:28,801 --> 00:08:29,961
- Hi.
- Pleased to meet you.

121
00:08:29,962 --> 00:08:31,080
Ask me what?

122
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,040
I just wanted to say congratulations
You ran a really great race today.

123
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,767
- Thank you.
- No problem.

124
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,763
So, I'm gonna be seeing you at the Valley.

125
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,965
Who was that?

126
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,126
Am I dreaming?

127
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,761
I pinched myself in the changing room.
I actually pinched myself, hard.

128
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,842
It was a big step for you.

129
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,400
You need to keep your times consistent
if you want a medal.

130
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,642
I beat Lisa Temple in a race today.

131
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,530
Did you see my time? Brian, did you
time me? Where was your watch?

132
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,365
- Are you even listening?
- I'm listening but can I scream now?

133
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,646
Yeah, go on.

134
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,643
Whoo!

135
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,007
<i>We're going to the Worlds!
Who's going?</i>

136
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,562
<i>- We're going to the Warlds...
- Well, no, you are.</i>

137
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,011
What? What do you mean?

138
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,481
- You're coming, too.
- I ain't coming.

139
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,846
My job's done.

140
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,080
What? No, listen.
Brian, they'll fund you and everything.

141
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,891
Look, I promised that I'd help you
get in the door and I have.

142
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,444
What? Where you're going, you're gonna
need more than one bloke and his dog.

143
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,804
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

144
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,882
It's up to you now.

145
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,161
<i>Tara?</i>

146
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,844
Yeah.

147
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,327
Tara, I won.

148
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,641
- Did you?
- Yeah. Made the national team.

149
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,560
I get to train with them, and then
I'm going World Champs, everything.

150
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:00,600
- Really? That's heavy.
- Yeah.

151
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,490
Look, I'm going shop, do you want anything?

152
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,050
No, I'm all right.

153
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,050
I did it, Mum.

154
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,850
- Shania.
- Hi, you all right?

155
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,400
- Hi, good to see you again.
- Yeah.

156
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,044
- How you doing?
- Not too bad. You?

157
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,168
Come this way. Very well, thank you.

158
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,802
Okay, so, our coaching squad will be
making sure you hit your targets.

159
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,723
And we need to get you kitted out.

160
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,963
- Who's your sponsor?
- I don't have one.

161
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,646
Okay. So, you've got your own kit then?

162
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,040
I think we can get you
some better spikes than that.

163
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,724
- Come with me.
- Okay, then.

164
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,201
Stand by.

165
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,849
Knees! Lift those knees!

166
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,089
...dropping your shin.
Don't drop before...

167
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,847
Who's that?

168
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,364
Nobody.

169
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,200
I'm just gonna speak to this new girl,
just go train with the girls.

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,240
Hello.

171
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,326
So, how you feeling?

172
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,400
Bit like I'm going to be
arrested for trespassing

173
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:04,321
but I'm all right, thank you.
How are you?

174
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,641
You know, divorced, stressed, underpaid.

175
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,482
Think I found a lump
in the shower this morning.

176
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,805
This isn't about me.
This is about you.

177
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,406
You're here because you're
the third ranked woman in Britain.

178
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,360
So how about doubling
your chances of a medal?

179
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,326
- What do you mean?
- Relay.

180
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,971
I've got a space on the team
and it's yours if you want it.

181
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,930
Yeah, I've never really
run the relay before.

182
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,563
Same principle as the solos -
run fast, win race.

183
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,126
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm not very good with teams, though.

184
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,249
- Come and meet the girls. Come on.
- All right.

185
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,522
Hey. What are you guys doing
standing around?

186
00:12:42,523 --> 00:12:44,323
We're not standing,
we're stretching, Coach.

187
00:12:44,324 --> 00:12:46,124
Yeah, stretching my arse.
Limber up, please.

188
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,245
Before you do, I want you
to meet Shania... Andrews?

189
00:12:48,323 --> 00:12:50,443
- Andrews.
- Shania Andrews, this is my relay squad.

190
00:12:50,444 --> 00:12:52,761
The fastest girls in Britain.

191
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,844
Rachel, long jump,
Belle and Sarah, hurdles,

192
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,570
Lisa Temple you know,

193
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,530
and of course, the legend
that is Trix Warren, 100 metres.

194
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,001
- You all right?
- I'm Carl, team physio.

195
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,003
Welcome to the team.

196
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,844
Carl will be yours throughout the season.

197
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,600
His brutal touch, your reward
for being a part of the relay squad.

198
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:11,009
I'll be gentle.

199
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,680
So, what, she's joining us, then, Tommy?

200
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:14,687
Well, she broke 23 in Surrey last week.

201
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,640
So, I think that's worth an invite,
don't you?

202
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:17,571
Yeah, we'll see.

203
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,040
Great. Well, we work around
everyone's solo events,

204
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,121
so there's a relay practice
at the end of the week.

205
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,366
So, are you up for it?

206
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,522
- All right.
- Good girl.

207
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,161
In the meantime, have fun, bond.
Love it. Medals. Let's go.

208
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,050
...Carl, can you pass me that?

209
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,009
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

210
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,320
- You all right?
- Cool,

211
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,891
I've dreamed about being here
my whole life, man.

212
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,644
I can't actually believe I'm here.

213
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,210
Me neither.

214
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,400
How about we just start again?

215
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,764
I didn't come here to make friends.

216
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,164
- Okay?
- Fine.

217
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,890
- You must be Shania.
- Yeah.

218
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,200
I hear you haven't got a coach.

219
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:00,394
Why don't you tag along
with Lisa and I for the day?

220
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,844
Yeah, all right.

221
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,360
Okay, girls, I want to practise
your block starts.

222
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:15,650
So, we'll run for 10 metres and then
we come back and do it again, okay?

223
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,681
Watch your hands.

224
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,763
Right, it's those first five paces
that really count.

225
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,842
Heads down, weight forward.

226
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,561
On the one. Three, two, one.

227
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,091
Good.

228
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,961
Nice. Nice, Lisa. Right.
Go back, do it again.

229
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,448
Really drive those arms, yeah?

230
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,888
And on the one.

231
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,282
Three, two, one.

232
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,165
Hey!

233
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,923
Hey, what the hell was that?

234
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,402
Come back, do it again.

235
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,486
- Water?
- Thanks.

236
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,650
<i>Barcelona, man.</i>

237
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,688
I've never even been on a plane, so...

238
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,283
Listen, the Indoors
are just a warm-up, girl.

239
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,650
Barcelona's big,
but it's nothing like the real thing.

240
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,529
Look, where do you pay for all this stuff?

241
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,841
Don't worry about it, babe.
It's all part of the deal.

242
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,206
Take as much as you like.

243
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,960
Trix is like the mother goose around here.

244
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,401
Hey! One kid at home's enough,
thanks, Belle.

245
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,643
Girls, are we looking at chicken
or are we eating chicken?

246
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,968
- I'm starving.
- Yeah, I can tell.

247
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,371
Jeez.

248
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,851
What is it with you two?

249
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,769
Nothing.

250
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,642
I just hope we're all as lucky
as she was when it comes to the Worlds.

251
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,087
I'm looking forward to beating you
a second time.

252
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,720
Yes, this one can stay!

253
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:35,867
I want you guys to go through
the first set of cones.

254
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:38,228
Take a lane each.
We're gonna practise the walking drills.

255
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:39,389
Slow, fast, high knees, okay?

256
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,369
You go past me, it's 20 push-ups.

257
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,601
Good work!

258
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,763
Okay, check marks. Let's go!
Mark your lanes, girls.

259
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,567
Hey.

260
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,371
Simple, all you've gotta do
is pass this baton around the track

261
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,407
as fast as you can.

262
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,565
- Simple, right?
- Yeah, simple.

263
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,962
Go!
Call it Loud and clear. I wanna hear it.

264
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,485
H a n d!

265
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,891
Good Speed!

266
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,327
Trix, Lisa, go.

267
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,961
Hand!

268
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,405
<i>Good, Lisa.</i>

269
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,680
Belle, Shania, don't take off
until she hits her mark.

270
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,450
Go!

271
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,450
Face forward, Shania!

272
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,688
Shania, Shania.

273
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,760
Okay, listen, you've got Belle
coming at you like a freight train,

274
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:30,761
but you hold
until she hits her change-over mark.

275
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:32,091
Then you fly, okay?

276
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,730
Okay, go.

277
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,325
Trust and timing.

278
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,368
That's all it's about.

279
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,090
Trust and timing. Got it.

280
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,402
- Hand!
- Come on, come on!

281
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,845
I need silk, ladies. Give me silk.

282
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,285
Hey, hey, concentrate, come on!

283
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,370
- Hand!
- Good! Good, Shania.

284
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,851
Yes!

285
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,766
- You nailed it. Wicked.
- Yeah. Wicked.

286
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,002
- Good. Now do it again.

287
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:08,201
- Here she is, the golden girl.
- Hello there, Mr Temple.

288
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,200
Great to see you, Trix.
How's the season going?

289
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:12,956
- Going well, thank you.
- Good, we want to see you on the podium.

290
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,147
You will.
Don't worry about it. See you later.

291
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:16,165
Yeah, take care.

292
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,368
- How's it going, Tommy?
- Yeah, we're getting there.

293
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:20,049
To be honest, if some of the other coaches

294
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:22,130
would give me
a little bit more time with the girls

295
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:24,051
then I think we've got
a real shot this season.

296
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:25,532
Well, you are the other coach, Tommy.

297
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:27,893
No offence, but the relay
isn't anybody's focus right now.

298
00:18:27,894 --> 00:18:29,051
I've asked, I have.

299
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,520
All they say is, "If you want
a team sport, go and play..."

300
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:33,647
- Football, yeah. Thanks, man.
- "...football" Yeah.

301
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,609
Dad, did you talk to them?

302
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,170
- Yes, yes, I've done it.
- Good.

303
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,168
Ms Andrews, hi.
I'm David Temple.

304
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,605
Look,

305
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,844
I'm afraid you're not gonna
be able to share Lisa's coach.

306
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,560
They've built up a routine over the years

307
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,281
and with the Worlds only a few months away,

308
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,130
it's just too close to disrupt them.

309
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,440
- I hope you understand.
- Yeah. Yeah, of course, yeah.

310
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:58,284
But don't worry. There's plenty
of really great coaches here.

311
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,001
I'm gonna personally make sure
that you get the best one, okay?

312
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,241
- Thanks.
- Okay.

313
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,970
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

314
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,007
Wow. Charming, ain't he?

315
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,771
All right.

316
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,890
Well, I would.

317
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,930
The man's old enough to be your...

318
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,604
My sugar daddy?

319
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,764
Now, there's an idea.

320
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,002
You're nasty.

321
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,481
What?

322
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,285
So, what's your story then?

323
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,010
Could you stand over there?

324
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,807
I started out as a runner, 400 metres.

325
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,728
I was a relay reserve in Beijing.

326
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,205
Turn around please.

327
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,729
Extend that leg towards me.

328
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,325
And the other.

329
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,930
Okay.

330
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,603
So, why'd you stop running?

331
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,244
There's a slight curvature.
You might have tight quads.

332
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,171
Can you face me, please?

333
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,525
You seem very good at your job.

334
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,802
Okay. All done.

335
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,920
Strong glutes.

336
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,120
Could you take this to Tommy for me please?

337
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,725
Yeah. Sure.

338
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,920
Good, good, good. Keep that drive,
keep that drive, keep that drive!

339
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,681
- Come on! Change, change, change.
- Stick.

340
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,967
Again, watch that hand...

341
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,086
Yep, YEP...

342
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,923
Carl asked me to give you these.

343
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,206
Who are they?

344
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,931
USA. The fastest.

345
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,489
See how they move as a team.

346
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,289
She knows when the stick's coming.

347
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,567
That doesn't look like how we do it.

348
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,040
That's because they use a downpass.

349
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,923
The stick comes in a downward motion.

350
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,800
Look, just like... that.

351
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,965
Gives you a whole meter of extra distance.

352
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,200
Why don't we do it like that?

353
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,726
Because it's very risky.

354
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,240
Bigger chance of dropping the stick.

355
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,404
Yeah, but if it's faster...

356
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,642
Look, those girls
have been together for years.

357
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,889
You see, they have got silk.

358
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,410
What we have isn't even polyester.

359
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,885
Bye-bye.

360
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,129
- Hey, Trix.
- Hey.

361
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,131
- Good first week?
- Yeah. It's all right.

362
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,924
You know, I don't get it.

363
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,644
So, the anchor, the last runner,
is meant to be the fastest, right?

364
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,245
- Yeah.
- So why is Lisa running it?

365
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,210
You're faster than her.

366
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,001
Well, that's because my daddy
was only a maths teacher.

367
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,091
What's up, ladies? Doing all right?

368
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,322
You lot heard about
this fundraiser on the 15th?

369
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,481
No.

370
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,642
My two favourite kind of people
are gonna be there.

371
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,882
- Fit men and rich men.

372
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,566
I'm gonna find myself a crossbreed.

373
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,320
So what, are we meant to bring a date?

374
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,325
You as well?

375
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,929
What? I'm just asking.
What you laughing at?

376
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,482
Hey, I'm married, babe, not blind.

377
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,121
Yeah, we saw you looking at Carl
with dreamy eyes.

378
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,364
- Please!
- Everybody does.

379
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,284
He's got that whole "boy band" look
goin' on for him, innit?

380
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,801
I'm telling you,
if it weren't for them rules,

381
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,689
I'd have climbed him like a tree already.

382
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,364
...You know what I'm saying?

383
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,442
Real talk.

384
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,885
What rules are you talking about?

385
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,201
No relationships
between athletes and staff.

386
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,964
It's an automatic sacking offence.

387
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,168
Anyway, the Worlds
are more important than that.

388
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,720
- Yeah.
- And, erm, be careful of Lisa.

389
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,962
That girl's been hot on him for years.

390
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,486
Please. She's the least
of my problems right now.

391
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,766
Girl, you're trying way too hard.

392
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,410
Like, why you going anyway?

393
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,280
Do you really think these rich
white people are gonna give you money?

394
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,605
Loads of black athletes get funding.

395
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,921
Yeah, but they don't look like you.

396
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,480
You know, you keep trying to run away

397
00:23:41,481 --> 00:23:44,250
but you've got like Primark
written all over you.

398
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,887
<i>So you are not
who you are in the public arena.</i>

399
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,166
<i>You become more who you are,
the more pr/vats you get.</i>

400
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,720
<i>So I kick back,
play my position and try listen</i>

401
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,007
<i>'Cause there's opportunities waitin'
it's my decision</i>

402
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,004
<i>The scene's getting ugly
And ugliness that's destroying the scene</i>

403
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,209
<i>But I feel beautiful right now
so I get dressed...</i>

404
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,327
Hi, Elise. Can I just have
a few shots? Thank you, that's great.

405
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,402
"Hey, girl.
- How you doing?

406
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,370
Hello.

407
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,646
It's your time tonight.

408
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,370
Yeah, any UPS?

409
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,569
[Ditch the O] and get something stronger.

410
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,688
...Makes it easier to talk to these suits.

411
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,761
Right.

412
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,480
- Who's Trix talking to?
- The money.

413
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,480
If she don't bring him that gold,
probably dump her for a younger model.

414
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,811
No!

415
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,927
I'll get a drink.

416
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,809
We'll be cheering you on to win that medal.

417
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,121
You just keep signing
those cheques, Mr Aldridge.

418
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,565
I won't let you down.

419
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,005
Must mingle.

420
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,248
- Baby...
- We'll be fine.

421
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,641
- Mr Temple?
- Watch your step. Smile.

422
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,130
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

423
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,204
Yeah, thanks.

424
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,851
Thanks.

425
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,207
- Watch it!
- I'm sorry.

426
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,851
- I think you've had enough.
- What?

427
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,885
What, you gonna get your daddy
to chuck me out, are ya?

428
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,961
Excuse me?

429
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,004
Daddy's little girl wanted to run anchor
so Daddy made it happen.

430
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,605
- I'm really sorry...
- You mutt!

431
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,880
Get your hands off me!
What do you think you're doing?

432
00:25:54,881 --> 00:25:56,806
This isn't some
after-school sports club.

433
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,760
We've all worked
our entire lives to get here.

434
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:00,284
I'm not gonna let you ruin that.

435
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,328
Listen, sweetheart,
I can look after myself.

436
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,568
- Thank you very much.
- Really?

437
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,642
It's the night before a meet
and you're drunk.

438
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,848
What kind of an athlete are you?

439
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,566
I'm really sorry about that.

440
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,249
Shania!

441
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,685
Where you been, girl?

442
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,601
Oi, what are you two doing back together?

443
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,207
Come on, man, she's my baby girl.
I can't let her get away from me, can I?

444
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,523
That's love, innit?
So you gonna join us?

445
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,123
I can't, man. I got a race tomorrow.

446
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,440
- Come on!
- Come on, man!

447
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,205
- Yeah! Yay!

448
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,770
Come on!

449
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,444
Yeah, all right.

450
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,682
- That's what I'm saying!
- Come on!

451
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,285
You're drunk.

452
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,089
I had to be, man, to get through that.

453
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,924
So, what, the party was crap?

454
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,049
Yeah. You was right.

455
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,407
- But this one's better.
- Yeah.

456
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,005
It is.

457
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,725
Be 900111, yeah?

458
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,720
- All right, have fun.
- Will do, babe.

459
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:28,202
Aw!
Nathan looks so grown-up.

460
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,760
I know. I hate leaving him.

461
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,046
Right, are we all here, guys?

462
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,484
Guess Shania ain't coming.

463
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,005
Well.
Sarah's faster anyway.

464
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,683
- Than Shania?
- Yeah, on average.

465
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,808
- Leave it out, Lisa, please.
- What?

466
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,320
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- I'm just saying Sarah's faster.

467
00:27:44,321 --> 00:27:46,446
Not on race day, ladies, please.

468
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,727
Where's Shania? Does anyone know?

469
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,208
Sorry, sorry! Sorry I'm late, Tommy.
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,521
Whoa!
Smells like someone had a good night.

471
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,285
Okay, what is going on between you two?

472
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,725
Let's just race our own races...

473
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,245
Okay, well, let's do it, okay?

474
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,480
- We really need to go.
- Yeah? Okay, great. Come on.

475
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,767
Guys, let's go!

476
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,001
Set...

477
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,840
What is wrong with Shania?
She's faster than that.

478
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,964
She's hung-over.

479
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,445
You all right?

480
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,561
What?

481
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,567
Look good and run fast, girl.

482
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,525
That's how it works.

483
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,245
Sorry, how you feeling?

484
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,441
I'm just glad it's over.

485
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,444
What about the relay?

486
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,571
Yeah, you better throw up
a couple more times, girl.

487
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,525
That all right?

488
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,762
- Don't start.
- I'm not starting.

489
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,800
Fourth place in that time
with a hangover's actually pretty good.

490
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,565
Come on.

491
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,808
Right, listen up. Come here.

492
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,087
Even though this is an exhibition,

493
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,162
you have to treat it like
it's the real thing.

494
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,400
Okay, now, the longer distance
is gonna suit you two.

495
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,891
We can win this.

496
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,724
So I need good bends
and clean change-overs

497
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,007
all the way, do you understand?

498
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,760
Good. Now let's go out there
and show 'em what we can do.

499
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:02,249
Let's bring it home, girls.

500
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,605
Boom!

501
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,328
Let's go! Come on!

502
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,286
Athletes, on your marks.

503
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,727
Come on, Trix.

504
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,965
- Come on, Trix!
- Go, Trix!

505
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,247
<i>Silencio, por favor.</i>

506
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,405
Set.

507
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,210
Home straight! Come on!

508
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,805
Belle, come on, come on.

509
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,245
Go, Belle!

510
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,841
Hand!

511
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,560
Knees high, Belle, knees high!

512
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,088
Hand! Hand!

513
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,285
Come on, Shania!

514
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,086
Hand!

515
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,924
What you doing, man?!

516
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,726
Come on, Lisa, run!

517
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,920
Come on, Lisa!

518
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,207
I don't need to tell you
what that was, do I?

519
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,527
No, actually, you know what? I do.

520
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,647
That was shit.

521
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,440
You're the fastest runners in Europe,
but together, you're awful.

522
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,721
- It wasn't all our fault.
- Yes, it was.

523
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,325
You win as a team, you lose as a team.

524
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,881
Shania called too early.

525
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,201
She's just not up to it.

526
00:33:37,202 --> 00:33:38,842
No, it wasn't just her fault, I was late.

527
00:33:38,921 --> 00:33:40,201
Why are you sticking up for her?

528
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:41,993
'Cause she ain't
a stuck-up bitch like you!

529
00:33:41,994 --> 00:33:42,801
Shania, shut it!

530
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,200
- So what, it was my fault?
- That's not what I said.

531
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:47,976
I'm sorry, I'm not risking my chance
of a medal because of her.

532
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,440
- Hey, hey, hey! What did I just say?
- Are you dumb, Tommy?

533
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:52,641
Her and her daddy call the shots
around here, not you!

534
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,640
So if that don't want me
on the team then fine!

535
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:55,726
Fine. I'm done. I quit.

536
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,962
- Shania...
- Shut up, Trix!

537
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,600
I ain't your little project, yeah?
I hate all of you. I'm done.

538
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,411
Mature, too. Great.

539
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,165
We don't need her.

540
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,728
You sure about that?

541
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,563
Jesus Christ!

542
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,041
Don't give me another injury
to worry about.

543
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,800
Tough day at the office?

544
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,610
Do you know what? I'm a sprinter, yeah?
Solo. No more distractions.

545
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,124
- Lisa's all right, you know.
- Yeah.

546
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,120
Yeah, she's got
a very funny way of showing it.

547
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:39,769
So do you.

548
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,971
- Patellar tendonitis.
- Sorry?

549
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,569
You asked me why I gave up running.

550
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,405
My knees.

551
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,729
- Carl.

552
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,570
Duty calls.

553
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,771
All right, man. What's up?

554
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,409
Trix, I just want to talk to Shania.

555
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,325
Not now, Tommy.
Please, I'm begging you.

556
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,680
Look, I'm not gonna
force you into anything.

557
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:23,529
If you want to be on your own, then fine.

558
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,965
But just hear me out here, okay?

559
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,283
That race yesterday, it meant nothing.

560
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,771
It was an exhibition.

561
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,407
But when we get to the Worlds
I'm gonna need you.

562
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,290
Now, the 4 x 100 metres
is where it's at. Okay?

563
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,805
Hey, I told you.
I'm not good with teams, innit?

564
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,484
Now you know what I mean.

565
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,125
Okay.

566
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,446
Okay.

567
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,605
Whoa! What happened?

568
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,205
Your sister.

569
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,727
Look at what she and her boyfriend did,
letting strangers in our home,

570
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,484
- stealing our things.
- Was it Daze?

571
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,844
Why did I let her stay?

572
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,560
Well, look,
I'll go and talk to him right now.

573
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:24,081
You do that, but don't come back here.

574
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,885
- I'm gonna look after my family now.
- What?

575
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,803
I've had enough of you both.

576
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,567
- No, look, I can... I can help...
- No!

577
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,400
I don't want you
staying here no more, Shania.

578
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,170
- Please...
- No. Not this time.

579
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,651
Just get out.

580
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,085
Daze, open the door!

581
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,565
Daze!

582
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,847
Who the fuck do you think you are?

583
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,320
Who do you think you're talking to?

584
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:17,685
Where's Tara?

585
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,160
Look, You know that girl,
she could be anywhere, all right?

586
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:22,561
What are you lot doing at my Auntie's?
You've nicked stuff,

587
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,290
and you break stuff.
She's chucked me out.

588
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,681
Really? That's bad news, babe.

589
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,641
Don't mess about with me, Daze,
not today, please.

590
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,120
- Tara!
- I told you,

591
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,089
she ain't here, man, stop this...

592
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,210
You know what?

593
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,440
Deal with this madness,
otherwise I'm gonna slap her.

594
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,885
She's chucked me out, Tara!

595
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,805
Well, don't go blaming me.

596
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,604
What? What's wrong with you?

597
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,842
You've got to go and apologize to her
or at least

598
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,651
- pay for the damages.
- Listen, don't tell me what to do, okay?

599
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,560
So, what, you're gonna let me stay here?

600
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:57,250
No. Daze don't like guests.

601
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,202
- So where am I gonna sleep, Tara?
- I don't know.

602
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,611
I'm not your mum, am I?

603
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,885
Listen, right, it's about time

604
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,566
you stopped messing about
and took life a bit more seriously.

605
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,805
...I got my own life to deal with.

606
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,409
- Mum!
- In here!

607
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,088
- There you are. How'd you get on?

608
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,446
Silver in the 200

609
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,885
and last in the relay.

610
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,530
Congratulations.

611
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,921
Congratulations? We came last.

612
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,729
But you won the silver.

613
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,724
You don't win silver, Mum.

614
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,371
It's a consolation for losing.
And I know you're gonna say

615
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,681
that that sounds really mean
and that I should just

616
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,402
look on the bright side
and try really hard.

617
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,445
...Listen, Lisa...

618
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,970
he won't reject you, you know.

619
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,523
You're still his daughter
whether you win or lose.

620
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,091
Really?

621
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,451
In you go.

622
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,884
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I got kicked out.

623
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,845
- What happened?
- It's a long story.

624
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,605
Why didn't you call? You could
stay at mine. I mean, you can.

625
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,809
Thanks, Brian.

626
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,009
Come on, get a shower at mine.
I'll give you a lift to training.

627
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,764
No. No, I ain't going back.

628
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,201
I quit the relay

629
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,442
and I just want to focus on my solo thing.

630
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,965
Come on, I'll put the kettle on.

631
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,484
It's pathetic, innit?

632
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,770
Sounds to me like you need
a good kick up the backside.

633
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,205
Thanks...

634
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,811
Coach.

635
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,841
Coach?

636
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,810
Come on, Brian. Please, man.
Just until the Worlds.

637
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,962
You do love to do things
the hard way, don't you?

638
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,451
Yeah, you know me.

639
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,124
Come on, then. Tea break over.

640
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,690
I'll see you out on that track.

641
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,491
Yes, Coach.

642
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,051
Right.

643
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,485
Come on then, back to the shop.

644
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,609
No, let's do it again.
Come on. Let's do it again.

645
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,285
It's no use rubbing that leg.

646
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,760
If you're feeling tight we should
go back to that physio of yours.

647
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:24,393
- Thought it was just me and you now.
- For the training it is.

648
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:26,034
But we don't refuse help when it's there.

649
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,440
- I don't really wanna...
- I'm not asking, I'm telling.

650
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,961
Hi.

651
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,641
Hi.

652
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,324
Do you have a minute?

653
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,641
Yeah. How can I help?

654
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,449
It's just my quads they're a bit tight.

655
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,169
- Hop on, then.
- Thanks.

656
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,529
Did you change your mind about the relay?

657
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,683
No. No, I'm back with my old coach.

658
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,489
Just about the 200 metres now.

659
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,765
All right.

660
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,846
- That hurts.
- I'd be worried if it didn't.

661
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:09,241
I didn't think this was part of it.

662
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,600
I thought you just had to
train hard and not eat crisps.

663
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,406
Yeah, me neither.

664
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,001
I only got into physio after my injury.

665
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,720
Before that it was all about the running.

666
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,287
Yeah, I'm sorry you can't do that any more.

667
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,486
It's all right.

668
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,609
- You can run for me.
- Thanks. Pressure.

669
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,123
Well, you seem to be able
to cope with that... well enough.

670
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,165
Ha-ha, very funny.

671
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,490
I don't miss the pressure.

672
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,440
I'd dream that I was running the race
the night before, every time.

673
00:42:39,441 --> 00:42:41,248
I know what you mean.

674
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,051
In my dreams I just run faster and faster

675
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,646
and it all goes a bit blurry.

676
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,080
Why are you running?

677
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,526
I don't know. Maybe I'm
trying to get somewhere better.

678
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,891
Do you know where that is?

679
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,125
I thought this was a physical.
I didn't ask for therapy.

680
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,282
Well, that I'll give you for free.

681
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,523
- All done.
- Great. Thank you.

682
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,848
This place isn't all that bad, you know.

683
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,083
You just got to give some of us a chance.

684
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,010
What, like you, you mean?

685
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,845
I'm here for my rubdown...

686
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,566
Doctor.

687
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,849
But I can wait outside.

688
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,840
Or watch.

689
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,610
No, I'm joking. I'll wait.

690
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,170
- How long were you standing there?
- Long enough.

691
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,208
You ain't gonna say nothing, are you?

692
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,321
- No.
- Thanks.

693
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,047
Well, I'm fine, thanks, Shania.
Nice of you to ask.

694
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,610
Yeah, it has been a while, hasn't it?

695
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,001
But I guess we've all
been focussing on our events.

696
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,565
I just...

697
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,124
I've been a bitch, ain't I?

698
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,970
- More of an ostrich, actually.
- What?

699
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,923
Sticking your head in the sand

700
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,889
then running damn fast in between.

701
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,124
You need a break, girl.

702
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,524
Just don't get in that zone too early

703
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,807
or else you will be loco
when the race comes.

704
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,325
- Okay.
- Trust me.

705
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,050
Then what are you suggesting?

706
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,364
- I'll see you Friday.
- What? What d'you...

707
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,960
No, no. If I stick around,
you're gonna try and get out of it.

708
00:44:38,961 --> 00:44:41,047
I will see you Friday. Yeah?

709
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,362
- Friday.
- Friday.

710
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,210
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

711
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,810
- You didn't say she was coming.
- Sorry, girl, my mistake.

712
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,530
- Hi.
- Hi.

713
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,726
You all right, babe?

714
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,560
So, this is a girls' night out,
I thought I'd bring some more girls.

715
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,611
Right. Well, we're here now.

716
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,480
Us mums don't get
to do this often. Come on.

717
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:07,241
Evening, ladies.

718
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,561
Come on.

719
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,527
Time to punch in!

720
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,886
- What?

721
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,800
Belle! What happened to
"a girls' night out"?

722
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,923
- I'll get the drinks.
- Ha-ha! She's off.

723
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:33,441
Hi.

724
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,683
So, are you ready for the move
to the athlete's village?

725
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,525
I think so. I'm really excited.
And you?

726
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,366
I've won every colour of medal
in this competition,

727
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,488
apart from gold.

728
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,360
Or is that even really winning though?
Or is it just not quite good enough?

729
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,168
Tsh! Sorry, I'm going off on one.

730
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,207
It's all right.

731
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,566
Yeah, I get it.

732
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,246
- I've got to own it next month.
- You will.

733
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,646
Come on.

734
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,440
- What about the drinks?
- We're athletes.

735
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:02,961
- We weren't meant to be sitting down.
- All right! All right!

736
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:17,243
No, no. This just isn't right.

737
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,446
Sorry?

738
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,160
A gorgeous girl like you all by yourself.

739
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:21,485
- Tell us your name.
- Go away.

740
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,245
- Just tell us your name.
- Can't you see my man's fallen in love?

741
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,970
- Come, let me take a picture.
- No.

742
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,640
Bet she's got ice in her knickers.

743
00:46:30,641 --> 00:46:31,606
Don't be so disgusting.

744
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,000
What, you need thawing out, babe?

745
00:46:33,001 --> 00:46:34,006
Belle. Come on, Belle.

746
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,128
Belle, come.

747
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,409
- We're still waiting for that name.
- Yeah, Lisa. Now can I go?

748
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,165
Yeah!
There's some more sisters up in here.

749
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,606
I know what this one wants.

750
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,640
Is it now? You think you're
man enough to give it to me, yeah?

751
00:46:46,641 --> 00:46:47,686
I like a challenge, innit?

752
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,240
- You'll lose, mate.
- I don't know the meaning of that word.

753
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:53,241
Yeah, I'm sure there's loads of words
you don't know the meaning of, love.

754
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:55,521
Like "deodorant" and "toothpaste".

755
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,602
<i>...</i> just saying

756
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,681
Come on, Lisa, let's go.

757
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,449
She's fine where she is.
Don't go disrespecting me now.

758
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,601
Why don't all of you just piss off?

759
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,806
Lisa, come on, let's go.

760
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,442
Come here!

761
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,000
Lisa, you really shouldn't have done that.

762
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,170
Come on, let's get 'em! Come on.

763
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,767
My shoes!

764
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,766
- That was so funny!

765
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,730
I wish Tommy could have seen that boy!

766
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,564
Yeah, you did good with that drink, Lisa.

767
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:10,160
- Just getting started.
- Really?

768
00:48:11,078 --> 00:48:13,398
Girls, where are we going next?
I'm not ready to go home.

769
00:48:13,399 --> 00:48:14,959
Listen, there's a club down the road...

770
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:15,920
Take me, Belle. Take me.

771
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,404
Take me to the club!

772
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,641
Take me to the club!

773
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,290
Whoo!

774
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,087
Girls, look.

775
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,083
Okay.

776
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,685
Now I'm sober.

777
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,082
- Okay.
- It's not Long now.

778
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,080
Hey. Sure we can't
persuade you to do the relay?

779
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,400
No, thanks.

780
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:47,800
Look, I'm a lot more fun
when I'm not in the team, innit?

781
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,841
Yes.

782
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,200
- Home time, girls.
- Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go that way.

783
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,001
Yeah.

784
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,731
- Miss, see you in a month.
- I had a wicked night.

785
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,565
- See you on the track.
- I'll see you on the track, yeah.

786
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,525
Stay focussed,

787
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,250
don't get distracted by the big lights,

788
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,767
and stick to your training programme, okay?

789
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,611
Come here.

790
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,566
Thanks, Brian, for everything.

791
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,768
You're gonna be a big star.
I know it. Yeah.

792
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,880
Well, good luck.

793
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,321
Thank you.

794
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,444
You know, I wish Mum could see you now.

795
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,249
Yeah, me, too.

796
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,526
Well, come here then.

797
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,130
- Love you, yeah.
- Yeah, me too.

798
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,651
- Well, I guess this is it then.
- Yeah.

799
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,881
Bring us home a medal.

800
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,484
- Done.

801
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,011
All right, see you, yeah.

802
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,005
Ready?

803
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,286
We're gonna need to
get a cabinet for all these soon.

804
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,686
Listen,

805
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,487
before we go

806
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,131
there's,
there's something I want you to have.

807
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,043
Dad, I...

808
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,645
Keep it with you, it's for luck.

809
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:19,847
Well, it's... It's heavy.

810
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:21,121
Yeah.

811
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,170
You look like you're going forever,
the amount you've packed.

812
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,840
- Bye, Mum.
- I'll be there to see you.

813
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,167
But don't put too much
pressure on yourself, okay?

814
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,120
Come on, Ellie,
this is what she was made for.

815
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,243
I'm always here for you. Regardless.

816
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,047
Bye.

00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,120
This isn't about them, this is about
everything that we've worked for.

859
00:54:31,121 --> 00:54:33,088
- Yeah.
- Okay.

860
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,730
Don't let us down?

861
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,567
I'll be right back.

862
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,245
Smash it.

863
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,570
<i>200 metres final.</i>

864
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,450
<i>Introducing the athletes
for the women's 200 metres final.</i>

865
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,087
<i>Lane one...</i>

866
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:56,130
<i>so here we go, the women's 200 metre final.</i>

867
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,601
<i>We've got two young Britons in there
with the world's best.</i>

868
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,001
<i>We've got Jill Anderson of Jamaica,
Femi of Nigeria,</i>

869
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,764
<i>then Temple of Great Britain.</i>

870
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,888
<i>The brilliant american, Kelly Harris,</i>

871
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,691
<i>she goes in Zane four,
Andrews in Zane five.</i>

872
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,569
<i>Then Kolachenko of the Ukraine,</i>

873
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:13,326
and finally a French athlete, Rouberre,
out in lane seven.

874
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,685
<i>All quiet, please.</i>

875
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,645
On your marks.

876
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,088
<i>50, ante again, the stadium goes quiet</i>

877
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,447
<i>for this final of the women's 200 metres.</i>

878
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,645
<i>Set...</i>

879
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,008
<i>Temple and Andrews
get away to a brilliant start.</i>

880
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,845
<i>They're being pressured by
Kelly Harris, United States.</i>

881
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,126
<i>Harris first
Harris takes the gold for America.</i>

882
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,129
<i>No medal for Great Britain</i>

883
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,884
<i>as Andrews finishes in fourth place,</i>

884
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,849
<i>just ahead of Temple in fifth.</i>

885
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,207
<i>They'll both be bitterly disappointed
with that</i>

886
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:24,763
<i>Shania Andrews, a good time.
She placed fourth in 22. 19 seconds.</i>

887
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,050
I'm sorry.

888
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,043
Don't look weak.

889
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,485
It's okay!

890
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,884
It's okay, honey!

891
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,965
This is not your fault.
It's all about him.

892
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,088
He put far too much pressure on you.

893
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,961
Shania!

894
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,121
Wait here.

895
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,291
Shania, wait!

896
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,564
Shania, wait up!

897
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,246
Shania!

898
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,055
<i>Both girls gave
everything. It wasn't enough.</i>

899
00:57:29,056 --> 00:57:31,136
When you're up against
sprinters like Kelly Harris,

900
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:32,657
I don't think there's much you can do.

901
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:34,618
But there's still hope
for our female sprinters.

902
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:37,205
Before we go trackside
for the 100 metres final,

903
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,725
let's take a quick look at what

904
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,371
golden girl Trix Warren
had to say about the race.

905
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,841
Buzzing. Ready. I can feel it
through every fibre of my being.

906
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,729
I'm ready to go out there and do it.

907
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,565
<i>This is the moment
that everybody in the stadium,</i>

908
00:57:50,602 --> 00:57:52,722
<i>everybody all over the country
has been waiting for.</i>

909
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,401
<i>Trix Warren goes head to head
with the world's very best sprinters.</i>

910
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,926
<i>La Toya of the United States
and Grant of Jamaica</i>

911
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,480
<i>could be her main opposition.</i>

912
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,484
<i>Can she get the medal
she's never won in the past?</i>

913
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,244
<i>And now there's a hush
around the stadium before the start.</i>

914
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,080
<i>Set...</i>

915
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,486
<i>Trix Warren falls!</i>

916
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,886
<i>Look at this!
Trix Warren has gone down.</i>

917
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,371
<i>That is terrible.</i>

918
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,367
<i>La Toya of the United States
is gonna win it.</i>

919
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,046
<i>Grant of Jamaica second Jacob in third.</i>

920
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,202
<i>What about poor old Trix Warren?</i>

921
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,046
<i>This injury that's been
blighting her for so many seasons now,</i>

922
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,441
<i>has brought to an and
her final! World Championship.</i>

923
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:51,966
<i>What a tragic day for this gifted sprinter.</i>

924
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,005
- Lift...

925
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,602
Trix, believe. You're gonna be fine.

926
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,720
- just stay strong like you are.
- She'll be fine.

927
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,401
<i>The news from the 65 team</i>

928
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:24,245
<i>is that Trix Warren's injury
puts her out of the games.</i>

929
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,005
<i>This injury could spell
the end of her career.</i>

930
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,730
<i>Let's hope that's not true.</i>

931
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,723
<i>I can only imagine
what she's going through...</i>

932
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,366
- I'm gutted for you, man.
- Yeah.

933
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,204
I'm kinda gutted myself.

934
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,524
But it's all right.

935
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,122
I got family waiting for me.

936
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,725
I've neglected them for far too long.

937
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,690
- Yeah, but, Trix, I'm so...
- Don't.

938
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,046
Everyone is so...

939
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,051
So let's just not talk about it, yeah?

940
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,804
Sit down. I want to talk about you.

941
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,530
- Me?
- Yeah.

942
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:59,609
You ran a good final, Shania.

943
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,650
I'm serious.

944
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,210
You've got what it takes

945
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:05,531
to be one of the best.

946
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:07,648
You just got to start playing the game.

947
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,449
- What do you mean?
- Relay.

948
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,002
- No, I'm serious.

949
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,766
- Tommy needs you to take my place.
- I can't, man, that girl, seriously...

950
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,888
Shania, this is your chance.
Don't waste it.

951
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:22,291
All you have to do is run together
for less than a minute.

952
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,360
Listen, girl, if there's one person
you do not say "no" to,

953
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,121
it's a cripple that has just blown
her last shot at her dream.

954
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,091
What, you think I'm guilt tripping you?
Hell, yes, I'm guilt tripping you.

955
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,211
Promise me you'll go out there
and run that relay for me.

956
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,647
Okay?

957
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,171
Yeah, all right.

958
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,204
That's what I'm talking about.

959
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,411
- Silk, yeah?
- Yeah, man. Silk, whatever.

960
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:55,967
Ready?

961
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,690
- Bye.
- Bye. You take care.

962
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,205
Yeah, you, too. Look after her.

963
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,400
- Will do.
- See you later.

964
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,205
Trix, thanks, yeah?

965
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,721
Trix is out, yeah,
so I want back on the team.

966
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,080
And I won't let you down, promise.

967
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,689
I've just run my personal best,
so I think I should be back.

968
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,400
I've just been talking to Trix and
she wants me back on the team.

969
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:31,561
Okay, Shania,
you're back on the team. Go.

970
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,971
Yes!

971
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,246
Thank you, Tommy.

972
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,767
Are you tight here?

973
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:44,047
You ready, Belle?

974
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,248
You got big shoes to fill.
This is your time.

975
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,280
Now, I know you can do it.
So I've put you on the first leg

976
01:01:49,281 --> 01:01:50,921
because I know you have that power, okay?

977
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,165
Yeah.

978
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,441
All right, here she is. Let's go.

979
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,201
Come on.

980
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,244
Okay. Listen up.

981
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,480
Semi-final. Let's keep it simple.
I don't want anything fancy.

982
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,043
And I definitely don't want anything
between you two, understand me?

983
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,565
<i>Athletes to track, please.</i>

984
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,768
Okay. Let's go. Go fast, go fast.

985
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,201
Let's do it.

986
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,561
- Shania...
- Just please, don't talk to me, yeah?

987
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,086
<i>This is the women's 4 X 100 metres relay.</i>

988
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,403
<i>The first four places will qualify
for the quarter finals.</i>

989
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,847
<i>Here are the teams.
From Trinidad and Tobago</i>...

990
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,604
<i>Proctor, McDonald, Cameron</i>

991
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,690
<i>This is the first semi-final</i>

992
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,649
<i>of the women's 4 X 100 metre relay,</i>

993
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,484
<i>and the big news is that</i>

994
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,642
<i>Shania Andrews has come in
as a late replacement</i>

995
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:43,324
<i>for the injured Trix Warren.</i>

996
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,689
<i>Now that means that Belle Newman
moves up to the first leg, Sarah Playaga</i>

997
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,649
<i>then Andrews, then Temple.</i>

998
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,680
<i>And they've got to be in the first four
to make it through to the final'.</i>

999
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,644
<i>But they've got strong opposition,
as you can imagine</i>

1000
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:01,611
<i>The Jamaicans are there, too,
Trinidad and Tobago, and France.</i>

1001
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,523
<i>They're all very strong teams indeed.</i>

1002
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:06,406
On your marks.

1003
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,086
Set...

1004
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,287
<i>They're off</i>

1005
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,441
<i>Ana' away we go.</i>

1006
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:22,720
<i>The Jamaicans have got off
to a tremendous start here.</i>

1007
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,808
<i>Jamaica are streaking away for it.</i>

1008
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,963
<i>Trinidad and Tobago are in contention,
but so are Great Britain.</i>

1009
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,960
<i>Ifs all gonna depend
on this first change-over.</i>

1010
01:03:29,961 --> 01:03:30,721
Hand!

1011
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,042
<i>Ana' ifs smooth. 11".? good.</i>

1012
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,088
<i>And there go Trinidad and Tobago, too.</i>

1013
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,366
<i>A way go Great Britain.</i>

1014
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,680
<i>They're still the top three.</i>

1015
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,801
<i>Ana' here we go,
in to the second change-over.</i>

1016
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:49,486
<i>That's not bad, but Great Britain seem
to have slipped back to fourth place.</i>

1017
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:52,370
<i>They'll need to make
the next change-over count.</i>

1018
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,964
<i>One change-over to go.
The Jamaicans are in front.</i>

1019
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:59,411
Hand!

1020
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,204
<i>That looked messy for Great Britain.
Its slow. The French move ahead.</i>

1021
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,681
<i>Temple trying to catch up,
but if doesn't look good.</i>

1022
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,161
<i>Jamaica, Trinidad, Brazil and France.</i>

1023
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,483
<i>Bad luck, GB.
The last change-over cost them dearly.</i>

1024
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:16,643
<i>What a shame. Just one place away
from making the final.</i>

1025
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:20,242
Belle, a quick word.
That couldn't have gone more wrong.

1026
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:23,005
Major disappointment.
A lot of time, effort and money...

1027
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,960
- What the hell was that?
- You were too slow!

1028
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:27,281
- That was your fault.
- Yeah, of course it was my fault,

1029
01:04:27,282 --> 01:04:29,242
'cause nothing touches
the golden girl, does it?

1030
01:04:29,243 --> 01:04:31,123
It's not my fault
your life is a screw-up!

1031
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,042
<i>...My goodness.</i>

1032
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:38,567
<i>The British team's emotions
are getting the better of them here.</i>

1033
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,240
<i>There's a fight on the track
between the British three and four,</i>

1034
01:04:41,241 --> 01:04:42,325
<i>Andrews and Temple.</i>

1035
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,131
<i>Hardly appropriate behaviour
for professional athletes.</i>

1036
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,406
Flippin"...

1037
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,760
<i>But wait! 1"/71 hearing a report</i>

1038
01:04:47,761 --> 01:04:50,241
<i>- I will sort it out!
- There's a penalty against the French.</i>

1039
01:04:50,242 --> 01:04:53,363
<i>The French team have a lane infringement
in their final leg.</i>

1040
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,728
<i>The French have been disqualified
Great Britain are through to the final.</i>

1041
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,290
Are you joking?

1042
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,640
It looks like you have
a second chance. That's exciting.

1043
01:05:00,641 --> 01:05:02,448
<i>Great Britain are back in it now</i>

1044
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,771
- She threw the first punch, Tommy.
- I know. I know, David, I saw.

1045
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:17,366
Along with thousands of other people.

1046
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,480
David's right.
She's an embarrassment to the team.

1047
01:05:19,481 --> 01:05:21,681
No, she's our fastest runner.

1048
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,889
Think about how this looks.
We're on the front pages now.

1049
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,883
Is this gonna make your CV look any better?

1050
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,210
Sorry, what are you suggesting?

1051
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,607
It would be a sad end
to a not exactly illustrious career.

1052
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,640
Right. So she's off the team or I'm
finished. Is that what you're saying?

1053
01:05:37,641 --> 01:05:40,769
We're not saying anything. What's your
conscience telling you to do?

1054
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,126
- Is this them or you?
- This is me. You're off the team.

1055
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,210
He made you do it, didn't he?

1056
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:04,001
There's nothing I can do.

1057
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,368
But you can't take this away
from me, Tommy, man.

1058
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,965
What I did was wrong before,

1059
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,691
and I know I shouldn't have
done what I did, but I'm sorry, I...

1060
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,048
Tommy's decision is final, I'm afraid.

1061
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,929
We can't let what you did go unpunished.

1062
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,480
You make us all, the whole sport, look bad.

1063
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,881
- But I...
- Let's not make another scene, okay?

1064
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:25,325
Okay.

1065
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,400
You know what?
Lisa's lucky she's got you.

1066
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,122
It's a lot different
from up here, isn't it?

1067
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:07,325
- This seat free?
- No.

1068
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,282
- How about this one?
- No, they're all taken.

1069
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:29,449
What you saw between me and Lisa,
it was nothing.

1070
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:33,244
She was upset after the race.

1071
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,444
Her dad...

1072
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,807
- Well, you know about her dad.
- Yeah, I do.

1073
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,689
I do, first-hand.

1074
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:47,451
What am I gonna do, Carl?

1075
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,602
I mean, they don't want me here.

1076
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:52,809
They just want me to crawl back
to wherever I come from.

1077
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,089
A smug bastard says you're out
and you just give up.

1078
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,960
- You're really gonna let him do that?
- I didn't give up, all right?

1079
01:07:58,961 --> 01:07:59,925
I was kicked out.

1080
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,727
Pricks like that can't always
get their way.

1081
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,201
And the Shania I know wouldn't let them.

1082
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:11,920
What am I supposed to do?

1083
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,880
He's not exactly gonna
return my calls, is he?

1084
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,010
Nah, he wouldn't.

1085
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,766
But I know someone who could
persuade him to change his mind.

1086
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,208
Lisa.

1087
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,562
Come on, we just...

1088
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,520
we just scratched each other's eyes out
in front of millions of people.

1089
01:08:31,584 --> 01:08:33,544
Yeah, and you also
just qualified for the finals

1090
01:08:33,545 --> 01:08:35,001
with the worst relay I've ever seen.

1091
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,448
Now imagine what would happen if you
actually ran together as a team.

1092
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:47,325
You said it yourself. You always dreamt
about running to somewhere better.

1093
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,086
Well, start there.

1094
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:56,400
So go and get your arse back
on that track where it belongs.

1095
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,804
Did you just talk about my arse?

1096
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,083
I meant your glutes.

1097
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,408
Yeah, it's worth a shot, innit?

1098
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,444
Just 'cause I'm listening to you
doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

1099
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:19,965
Come on.

1100
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,720
No, you can wait.
I've got a race to run.

1101
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,242
...Come in.

1102
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:36,364
I thought you'd left.

1103
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,249
Okay.

1104
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:42,086
So, the way I see things, right,
me and you got two things in common.

1105
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:44,322
Yeah. What are they?

1106
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:48,041
One - we both hate each other,
and two - we're both fucking fast.

1107
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,801
- So?
- So, I'm saying,

1108
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:55,441
if we get our shit together...
no one can beat us.

1109
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,491
I seem to remember you getting
kicked off the team.

1110
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,245
Yeah, and we both know
who's behind that, don't we?

1111
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:07,286
Look, I ain't gonna try and pry into
your family business or nothing,

1112
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:10,047
'cause I know if you tried that shit
with me, I'd rip your head off.

1113
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,727
But I'm just saying, there does come
a time in a girl's life, yeah,

1114
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,600
where she just needs to
stand up for herself

1115
01:10:15,601 --> 01:10:17,481
and tell her dad to
just stick it up his arse.

1116
01:10:17,482 --> 01:10:21,291
Nobody talks about my dad like that.

1117
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,488
- No, and I'm sorry...
- No, it's...

1118
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,925
It's okay.

1119
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,731
It's a nice change.

1120
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,811
- Is that what you did with your dad?
- No.

1121
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:36,285
My dad just left.

1122
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,411
- Right. Sorry.
- No, that's all right.

1123
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,450
It just means he ain't around
to boss me about like your dad.

1124
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,884
All right then, tomorrow, show me
what you got, and we'll see.

1125
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,406
Why don't we do it now?

1126
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,608
Tracks are all closed.

1127
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,444
Come on, man. Get your trainers.

1128
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,010
I know somewhere.

1129
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,807
- Shania...
- What?

1130
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,081
Come on. Trust me.

1131
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,289
Again. It's late. It's too late.

1132
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,360
Just like the semi-finals.

1133
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:39,851
Just needs marked.

1134
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:47,204
And again.

1135
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,570
Too late!

1136
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,600
- It's never gonna happen.
- Yeah, it's all right. It don't matter.

1137
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:56,287
We're gonna get this. All right?

1138
01:11:57,160 --> 01:11:58,161
Shania...

1139
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,969
We can't get our marks right,

1140
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,805
but it's irrelevant anyway
'cause you're faster than me.

1141
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,969
So let's swap it around.

1142
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,326
What?

1143
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:12,811
Fastest runs anchor, right?

1144
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,771
All right.

1145
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,966
Sure?

1146
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,531
Yeah.

1147
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,961
Hand.

1148
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:36,486
Whoo! jeez!

1149
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:38,727
Hand!

1150
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,080
Boom!

1151
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:42,760
Are you sure you're all right with this?

1152
01:12:42,761 --> 01:12:45,091
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1153
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:49,486
Hand!

1154
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,241
- That was it! That was the one.
- That was the one.

1155
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,685
We've got it.

1156
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,921
- Yes!
- Finally.

1157
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,483
- Go for gold.
- Gold 2011.

1158
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,685
...Excuse me. Dad?

1159
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:11,841
Hello.

1160
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,365
Can I just talk to you a sec?

1161
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,169
It's last chance today. You ready?

1162
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:16,924
I've looked at the American stats and...

1163
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,968
- Dad.
- Yeah, what?

1164
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,610
I want Shania back on the team.

1165
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,485
Yeah,

1166
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,285
Come over here.

1167
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,167
Is this nerves?

1168
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:36,644
No, it's not. We practiced last night
and we're really good.

1169
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,882
Don't be ridiculous, Lisa. She's banned.

1170
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,804
Yes, I know.
But she's the fastest. We need her.

1171
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,689
No, you're faster than her.

1172
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,125
No. I'm not.

1173
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,363
She's a liability. She's out of control.

1174
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:52,440
- You got Tommy to take her off the team.
- You're better off without her.

1175
01:13:52,441 --> 01:13:54,442
So I'm asking you to put her back on.

1176
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,600
Darling, I'm just trying to do
what's best for you.

1177
01:13:56,601 --> 01:13:57,841
Yeah, then put her on the team.

1178
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:00,167
This is our last chance at a medal.

1179
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,925
My last chance.

1180
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,761
Excuse me?

1181
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,408
It's mine, not yours.

1182
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,488
Well, if you'd run
a better race in the 200,

1183
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:13,040
it wouldn't be your last chance, would it?

1184
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,805
What? That's the reality. You lost.

1185
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,360
So now we can't have
any more distractions or fights.

1186
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,920
Okay, this is yours.

1187
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:31,926
I have spent my whole life
trying to please you.

1188
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,331
This is my time now.

1189
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:40,407
Dad, either you bring Shania back

1190
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,361
or I quit.

1191
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,651
- What?
- No, I mean it.

1192
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:48,246
I don't care what you think of me any more.

1193
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:53,406
Win or lose, I am running this race
on my own terms, not yours.

1194
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:02,522
So, how did it go?

1195
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,045
I can't breathe.

1196
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,088
...What? What!

1197
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,606
Lisa, what did you say, man?

1198
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,209
<i>Once again, we have a capacity crowd</i>

1199
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:29,566
<i>here at the World Championships</i>

1200
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:33,049
<i>for what promises to be a fantastic
final for the women's 4 X 100 metres...</i>

1201
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:35,370
- Get me another beer, please, babe.
- I'm watching this.

1202
01:15:35,441 --> 01:15:37,961
<i>- Go get me another drink, man
- The British team facing stiff</i>

1203
01:15:37,962 --> 01:15:38,962
<i>competition on the track.</i>

1204
01:15:38,963 --> 01:15:41,489
<i>Can they put their differences aside
and bring home a medal?</i>

1205
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:45,531
<i>We're gonna watch four
British women bid for world glory.</i>

1206
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,604
<i>They've had such turmoil
during the championship so far.</i>

1207
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:49,647
<i>Can they deliver today?</i>

1208
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,160
<i>Its been a dramatic road
to this final for the British team.</i>

1209
01:15:52,161 --> 01:15:56,522
<i>Fifth in the semi-finals,
until the French were disqualified</i>

1210
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,648
One more shot, okay?

1211
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,006
Yeah, we can do this.

1212
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:02,128
- Hell, yeah, girl.
- Fists in.

1213
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,687
Okay. Well, you know...

1214
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,080
I did have a big speech prepared
which you've now ruined.

1215
01:16:07,152 --> 01:16:09,112
- Had it written on cards and everything.
- Aww!

1216
01:16:09,113 --> 01:16:11,048
Okay, okay. You know what?
Just go do it.

1217
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,641
Just go do it.

1218
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,447
- Boom.
- GB, come on.

1219
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,087
Come on, don't screw it up.

1220
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,690
Oi. What's up?

1221
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:36,570
I've never passed the baton in a race
before. I've always run anchor.

1222
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,085
Do you wanna switch?

1223
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,646
No. I'll be fine.

1224
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,848
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. We're good.

1225
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,163
<i>...welcome out the teams
for the women's 4 X 100 metres relay.</i>

1226
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,890
<i>Ukraine, Nigeria...</i>

1227
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,043
<i>.. Great Britain, USA...</i>

1228
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:57,808
<i>Great Britain start right next to
the favourites, the United States.</i>

1229
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,803
<i>And of course,
we've got the Ukraine in there,</i>

1230
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,041
<i>we've got the Jamaicans.</i>

1231
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:03,282
<i>We've got the world's
very best relay teams.</i>

1232
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:05,480
What's she doing on the third leg?
She's the anchor.

1233
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,409
David, sit down.

1234
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,850
On your marks.

1235
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,291
Set...

1236
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,680
<i>Well, that's a great start
by Great Britain.</i>

1237
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,769
<i>Newman is absolutely powering
around that top bend.</i>

1238
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,360
Hand!

1239
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,522
<i>Superb performance by the British.</i>

1240
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,251
<i>Going into the back straight.
This is the long leg.</i>

1241
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,531
<i>What a difference a day makes here
for Great Britain</i>

1242
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,001
<i>They're absolutely flying
around the top bend.</i>

1243
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,889
<i>A great run from Lisa Temple.</i>

1244
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,450
<i>Coming towards the last change-over now</i>

1245
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,921
Hand!

1246
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,405
- Come on, Shania!
- Run, sis!

1247
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:48,051
<i>Heading towards
the line. Andrews gaining!</i>

1248
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,170
<i>Ifs gonna be dose!</i>

1249
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,611
<i>And it looks like a photo finish!
So, so close.</i>

1250
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:09,527
<i>I'm not quite sure who won that</i> -
<i>the USA, Jamaica, or Great Britain.</i>

1251
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,047
<i>What a fabulous, fabulous final.
It couldn't be closer.</i>

1252
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,960
<i>- What happened? Did they win?
- The stadium is holding its breath</i>

1253
01:20:15,961 --> 01:20:17,129
<i>waiting for the final result.</i>

1254
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,526
<i>Ifs Great Britain!</i>

1255
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:25,807
Whoo!

1256
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,685
- Yes!

1257
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:30,326
<i>What a comeback</i>

1258
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,165
<i>Have you ever seen
anything like that before?</i>

1259
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,447
<i>The closest final in years.</i>

1260
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:39,608
<i>Out of chaos they have pulled off
something spectacular.</i>

1261
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,728
<i>Its gold for Great Britain.</i>

1262
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:44,527
Darling!

1263
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:46,364
- Dad!
'Darling!

1264
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:47,851

1265
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,847
Mum!

1266

I love you!

1267

- Come here!
- I told you you could do it!

1268
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,289
Lisa, Lisa, Lisa, come on, talk to me.
World Champion...

1269
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:27,725

1270
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,564
My God! We did it together.

1271
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:30,721
- We did it!
- We did it.

1272
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,529
...Hi, Mum.

1273
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,806
Whoo!

1274
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:36,680
Ah!

1275
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,201
Boom!

1276

Go, go, go! Well done!

1278
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,800
It feels great.
Today they listened to me.

1279
01:21:47,801 --> 01:21:50,127
Swish! Boom! What a great run!

1280
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,561
- Linford, get out of there!

1281
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,089
