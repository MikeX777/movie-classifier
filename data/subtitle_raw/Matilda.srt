- Come in.

19
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,880
Just let me put my bicycle
down and get things started

20
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,560
and then we can talk.

21
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,280
All right?

22
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,400
The name's Billy Baker and
this is my pub.

23
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,760
You can call me "The Kid,"
if you like.

24
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,120
That's the name I go under.

25
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,440
That was my fighting name.

26
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,600
109 fights and I
only lost three.

27
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,880
And they weren't the
last three either.

28
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
I was Welterweight Champion
of the British Isles

29
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,880
and I fought them all.

30
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,040
Charlie Madden,

31
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,200
Ruben Murillo and...

32
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,160
earned these ships.

33
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,160
But the greatest fighter I
ever stepped into a ring with

34
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,720
was this one.

35
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,040
Matilda.

36
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,920
That's right.

37
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,800
A kangaroo.

38
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,480
You know,

39
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,360
if God created man and beast,

40
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,480
then I'd have to say,

41
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,960
he gave Matlida the most
extraordinary talent.

42
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,720
More than any other
fighter that ever lived.

43
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,720
People think that
ex-fighters like me

44
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,280
end up owning pubs like this.

45
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,440
But it's not true.

46
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,560
In fact,

47
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,520
most of us end up not being
able to pay for our own drinks.

48
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,080
Matilda got me this.

49
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,400
Like he got everything for
everyone that ever knew him.

50
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Seems like only yesterday
when me and Matilda

51
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,760
arrived in America.

52
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,720
Times were hard.

53
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,320
We were hungry.

54
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,640
And I'll tell you,

55
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
New York isn't a place
to be hungry.

56
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,080
I tried explaining Matilda
was just loving him.

57
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,600
But the poor bloke
was scared stiff

58
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,560
when there was no
calming anybody down.

59
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,800
I didn't know what to do.

60
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,360
I was desperate.

61
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,520
They carted Matilda off
to a dog jail.

62
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,800
Then I saw in this show
business paper

63
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,120
a little advertisement
on the bottom of the page

64
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,400
that said, "Book with Bernie."

65
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,560
But it was me only hope.

66
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,080
- Lee don't give no
exhibition in Toledo

67
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,280
for that kind of money.

68
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,040
You tell Carter not to call
me till he triples the money,

69
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,680
and even then I ain't
guaranteeing nothing.

70
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,840
What do you got, a tape worm?

71
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,920
No, no, not you.

72
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,200
Forget it.

73
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,280
And tell Carter, next
time he calls me at lunch,

74
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,520
make sure I ain't eaten.

75
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,000
- Hello, Book with Bernie.

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,480
A knife throwing act, Mr.
Matson?

77
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,160
Sure I got it, the greatest!

78
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,680
You never saw one like it.

79
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,720
It's like everybody's hair is
standing up when they see it.

80
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,200
You've seen a lot of knife
throwing acts, Mr. Matson,

81
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,800
but never one where the
man's blindfolded,

82
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,280
the girl spins on a wheel.

83
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,480
The lights go out.

84
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,560
He got flaming torches
at the end of the knives

85
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,240
and the last one he
throws at her

86
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,600
got a firework inside
which goes off!

87
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
And when the lights come up,

88
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,560
she got an American flag
over her head!

89
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,040
It's stupendous!

90
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,640
He loved it!

91
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,200
- You wanna know something?

92
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,800
You're dangerous.

93
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,840
I mean, only a bent mind would
think up an act like that.

94
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,720
A broad on a flag with a wheel.

95
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,320
- What are you, an impresario?

96
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,640
- No, I'm the guy who pays
the rent, your brother-in-law.

97
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,120
The money you owe me, remember?

98
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,000
- How could I forgot?

99
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,000
You remind me five times a day.

100
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,560
- There's one thing I can't
stand and that's a person

101
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,320
who don't appreciate what
another person has done for him!

102
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,640
Remember?

103
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,080
- From the first
day I married your sister,

104
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,880
I took you in 'cause you
was an orphan.

105
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,360
I felt sorry 'cause you--

106
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,360
- "Were such a young kid to
lose your mother and father."

107
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,960
You abused my sister
and never let her forget

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,640
that you were giving
me a free room!

109
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,000
- Look, buddy, let's
cut this out.

110
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,600
Let's stop being polite
to each other.

111
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,400
Now I'll spell it out for
you so you'll understand.

112
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,040
You are, always were and
always will be a loser!

113
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,480
- With a capital "L."

114
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,360
- So do me a favor.

115
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,040
Pack this show business in.

116
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,360
Get yourself a steady job

117
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
because your kind of
show business is over!

118
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,720
O-V-E-R!

119
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,880
Through!

120
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,040
- Speaking of over,
boxing is so crooked,

121
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,440
it's one step away
from wrestling.

122
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,440
Nobody cares about it anymore!

123
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,680
- They care about me.

124
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,080
Don't they, Pinky?

125
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,200
- Certainly, certainly, Champ.

126
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,960
You're a public idol,
they love you.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,480
- Don't make me laugh, you
ain't had one fight this year.

128
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,400
Pinky's dodging every
serious contender.

129
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,320
- What're you now, a
boxing authority?!

130
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,520
- I don't have to be.

131
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,440
It says so right here in
Duke Parkhurst's column.

132
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,320
- Duke Parkhurst.

133
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,920
What is this Parkhurst?

134
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,480
A two-bit sports writer,
can't put on his shoes.

135
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,800
- Yeah, that's right,
he's a bum.

136
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,480
- Mr. Parkhurst just
happens to be

137
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,000
the most influential
sports writer in the world.

138
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,040
- What are you now, his
publicity agent?

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Yeah?

140
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,800
You looking for something?

141
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,400
- The name's Billy Baker.

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,200
Former Welterweight Champion
of the British Isles.

143
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,800
Known as "the Burmazi Kid"

144
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,760
- Sorry, we ain't
hiring no seconds.

145
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,360
- Have I the honor of
address Mr. Bernie Bonnelli?

146
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,240
- Mr. Bonnelli?

147
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,760
Oh, this here is Mr. Bonnelli.

148
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,160
The biggest
impresario in New York.

149
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,320
- Pleased to make your
acquaintance, sir.

150
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,640
So to speak, I've come
on a matter of business.

151
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,080
Allow me to introduce myself.

152
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,640
Billy Baker,

153
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,320
known at home and abroad
as "the Burmazi Kid."

154
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,760
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr.
Baker,

155
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,960
but you see, I've got
nothing to do with boxing.

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,560
I just book acts.

157
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,640
- But I have an act, sir.

158
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,720
Me and Matilda.

159
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,560
- Matilda?

160
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,320
What kind of act do you do?

161
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,200
- We've got the greatest
boxing act in the world, sir.

162
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
- You box a lady?

163
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,680
- Oh no, Matilda isn't a lady.

164
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,560
He's a "he."

165
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,400
He's the greatest boxing
roo in the world.

166
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,400
- A what?

167
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
- A roo.

168
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,240
A kangaroo.

169
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,040
- Oh.

170
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,880
- A roo!

171
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,600
A boxing kangaroo, governor.

172
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,320
- I had a pair of slippers
once made out of kangaroo.

173
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,000
- Nobody's buying
animal acts today.

174
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,680
Maybe six months from now.

175
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,800
- Well it's not just an act,
sir.

176
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,200
Matilda is the greatest
boxer in the world.

177
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Well, no fighter has ever gone
more than two round with him.

178
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,360
- Sign him, buddy.

179
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,720
He's the first guy I ever met

180
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,960
who's even a bigger
loser than you.

181
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,360
I can't stand it anymore.

182
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
Come on, Champ.

183
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,720
A roo.

184
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,240
A boxing kangaroo.

185
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,760
- Look at those sad, lonely eyes

186
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,280
full of expressions of love.

187
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,080
He's in a dog jail now,
just at this minute.

188
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,520
He's like a son to me, Mr.
Bonnelli.

189
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,760
He's all I've got in the world.

190
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,000
- Look, Mr. Baker,

191
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
I'm sorry, I wish I could
help you but, you see,

192
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,600
the fact is, I can barely
help myself nowadays.

193
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,960
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,720
- No.

195
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,600
No.

196
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,040
I couldn't eat knowing

197
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,360
Matilda's starving in a
prison somewhere.

198
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,320
- Hey!

199
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,440
You wanna pay?

200
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,680
- Keep it running, we'll
be out in a minute.

201
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,560
Excuse me, lady.

202
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,360
- You won't be sorry for this,
Mr. Bernie.

203
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,840
I promise you that, I promise.

204
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,880
- Hello, I'd like to...

205
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Sir?

206
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,200
Sir?

207
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,400
Hello, could you help us,
please?

208
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,280
Mister, sir?

209
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,120
Hello?

210
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,880
- Mister, officer, officer,

211
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,520
I've come for my kangaroo,
Matilda.

212
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,920
- Did you now?

213
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,440
We get a lot of kangaroos here,
hundreds.

214
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,480
- Mister,

215
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,280
would you look at it, please?

216
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,720
Please, please, will
you look at it?

217
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,960
- Which one's yours?

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,480
- Well, he's about as...

219
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,240
Well, he's about as
big as you are.

220
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
But he's got the most
beautiful grayish fur.

221
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,960
- Look, bub, we got
enough weird animals

222
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,440
around here already.

223
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,680
Maybe you two better
be moving on

224
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,000
before I run you in for
disturbing the peace!

225
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,080
- Eddie!

226
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,840
Eddie, these people are serious.

227
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,520
They love their pet as well
as you love your children.

228
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,240
- I hate my children, Smith.

229
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,720
What's with that kangaroo?

230
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,600
- You're right, ma'am, that
kangaroo is like a son to him

231
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,360
and me.

232
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,800
- They're checking to
see who got gassed today.

233
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,160
- Gassed?

234
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,040
- Gassed?

235
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,800
- If anything happened to
this man's son,

236
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,760
we'll sue everybody!

237
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,880
The city, the state!

238
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,800
- No, no, the worst that
could've happened

239
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,520
is they've taken him to the zoo.

240
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,760
- A zoo?

241
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,720
But...

242
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,440
But Matilda isn't a wild animal.

243
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,960
- You guys think you
can take an innocent kid

244
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,760
and throw him behind bars?

245
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,120
No way!

246
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,960
- Eddie, you see, that's
exactly what I'm talking about.

247
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,160
You're not only totally

248
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
insensitive to animals
but people,

249
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,800
these are people
and they have feelings.

250
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,240
- Yeah, we have feelings.

251
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,760
By the way, my name is Bonnelli,

252
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,040
Bernie Bonnelli.

253
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,960
I'm a theatrical agent.

254
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,160
- Why, I'm Kathleen
Smith and I've worked for

255
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,440
the Association For the

256
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,240
Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals.

257
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
- Oh.

258
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
- That's him!

259
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,360
That's Matilda.

260
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,320
They found him!

261
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,400
- Okay, wise guys.

262
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,760
Come and get that
kangaroo out of here

263
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,600
and get him out of here
but quick or we'll gas him.

264
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,960
He just boxed one of out
guys in there.

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,920
You better hope he ain't dead.

266
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,040
- He knocked him out?

267
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,840
- Zap, one punch and
poor Stanley,

268
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,680
he awfully had a pounding and
laying on his back smiling.

269
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,760
Out like a light.

270
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,280
- Matilda wouldn't hurt anybody.

271
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,600
He was just playing.

272
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
He loves to box.

273
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,120
- Things
were looking up

274
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
until Bernie invited Miss
Smith to watch Matilda box,

275
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,360
then she nearly went bonkers.

276
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,800
- Well I'm very sorry
but I cannot allow this.

277
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,200
- I can't believe this woman.

278
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,640
- I said, I will not
permit this!

279
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,880
- Listen, lady,

280
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,960
I have always suspected
people like you

281
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,520
who do goody-good things
for animals and whatever.

282
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,680
There's something inside
of them, in their lives,

283
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,400
that ain't working.

284
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
Something empty.

285
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,280
So fill yourself up with
something besides my marsupial.

286
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,200
- What the hell is that?

287
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,160
- My first wife, come in.

288
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,440
- Look, just forget about it.

289
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
Just give me my money
and I'll get out of here.

290
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,840
- Here's an extra 50, come on.

291
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,120
- Hey, what're you guys, a joke?

292
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,440
I've got my meter running
for over an hour now.

293
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,560
- What're you complaining
about, making money?

294
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,320
Here, see?

295
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,960
That's just the tip, okay?

296
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,280
- All right, whatever
she does in that cab,

297
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,880
you guys have to clean up.

298
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,960
- Listen, mister,

299
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,480
that kangaroo is as
clean as you are.

300
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,480
And he can hold his
water like a camel.

301
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,360
- Would I ever lie to you, Mr.
Donohue?

302
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,000
- Don't talk to me like
we met five minutes ago.

303
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,400
I can't remember the last
time you told me the truth.

304
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,280
- Oh, I was just trying
to help Pinky, you know?

305
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,360
Lying to family doesn't count.

306
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,520
But now I'm telling you
for real, Mr. Donohue.

307
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,760
This is the greatest
fighter that ever walked.

308
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,640
Hopped.

309
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,880
- Look,

310
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,760
cut the bologna, Bonnelli,
it ain't necessary.

311
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,280
The only reason I let this
misguided creature in here

312
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,560
is because I like you.

313
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,440
- Thanks, Mr. Donohue.

314
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,720
Okay, let's do it!

315
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,240
- What's happening?

316
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,520
What's going on?

317
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,200
- He's putting a
little class in the joint.

318
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,280
- I gotta make a phone call.

319
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,880
I can't hear myself
getting rich.

320
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
Mr. Matson, am I glad
I found you!

321
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,080
I got good news an bad news.

322
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,400
First the bad news, Mr. Matson.

323
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,080
The knife throwing act is out.

324
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,200
I got a kangaroo.

325
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, an act
with a kangaroo.

326
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,560
A boxing kangaroo, Mr. Matson.

327
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,000
He's undefeated with...

328
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,640
Six straight knockouts!

329
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,680
Listen to me, Mr. Matson,
this show is rated G.

330
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,000
Something for everybody.

331
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,800
I am giving 500 dollars, Mr.
Matson,

332
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,680
500 dollars to anyone
who can stay

333
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,840
two regulation rounds
with my kangaroo!

334
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,840
Of course I'll supply the
500 dollars, Mr. Matson.

335
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,560
Would I be calling you if
I didn't have the money?

336
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,040
My chauffeur is right outside,
Mr. Matson.

337
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,200
We're almost there.

338
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,200
- I just called
my friend, Duke.

339
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,320
Duke Parkhurst, you
ever hear of him?

340
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,280
Well, he's a sports
writer here in town.

341
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,680
Anyway, he's gonna give
you guys a plug,

342
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,080
you know, mention the kangaroo.

343
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,560
- How long have you
known Parkhurst, Gordon?

344
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,560
- I've been giving him
tips for years.

345
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,840
Huh?

346
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
Strictly confidential stuff.

347
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,800
You know, you'd be surprised
what you hear in a cab.

348
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,760
- No, I wouldn't.

349
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,120
Life is really funny, isn't it?

350
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,240
- I don't know what you mean.

351
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,080
- Why do you think, with
all the cabs in New York,

352
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:29,880
we got into this one?

353
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,600
- Well, he was the only
one who would stop.

354
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,240
- Right.

355
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
But why did he stop?

356
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,960
Why did he put his foot
on the break?

357
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,800
- I don't know.

358
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,240
Why did he put his foot
on the break?

359
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
- Fate.

360
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,160
Fate!

361
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,760
How else can you explain it?

362
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,280
There we were, you,
me and Matilda,

363
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,800
standing on Broadway on
our way to the big times,

364
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,200
lacking only one thing.

365
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,160
A guy with a lot of style

366
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,400
who could handle a
lot of problems.

367
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,840
- We were?

368
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,160
- And screech, this cab pulls
up and who's at the wheel?

369
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,720
- Gordon.

370
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,680
- Gordon Baum, right!

371
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,040
Someone sent him to us.

372
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,560
Gordon, how would you like
to be in business with us?

373
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,080
To have responsibilities
for a champion, Gordon,

374
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,240
a real star.

375
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,320
You own five percent of Matilda

376
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,520
and you get to see your
name in the press.

377
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,600
- Listen, I'm not interested
in any other businesses.

378
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,480
- Gordon, this isn't any
other businesses.

379
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,240
It's show business.

380
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,280
No, no, no.

381
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,120
You wait in the car.

382
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,560
Wait in the car.

383
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,760
I'm just going inside for a
minute to see my financier.

384
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,760
Ah, flowers.

385
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,880

- Oh, you shouldn't have.
- Yeah!

392
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,720
Bravo!

393
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,240
- They're plastic.

394
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,440
- I know, they'll last longer.

395
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
Well, baby, it's
finally happened.

396
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,280
I had to come tell you myself.

397
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,120
- What?

398
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,040
- The big time.

399
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,320
The whole enchilada.

400
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,720
The Hollywood Bowl.

401
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,560
I am introducing you to
the coast myself.

402
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,840
- Oh, I knew it, Bernie.

403
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,080
I never doubted you, even
when all my friends said

404
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
all those bad things about you.

405
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,200
Oh, Bernie, you're the best
agent in the whole world.

406
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,360
- First there's this other
deal I got to put to bed.

407
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,760
- Really, what deal?

408
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,160
- Tanya, my sweet,

409
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,960
the gods have smiled upon us.

410
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,160
They have given us Matilda!

411
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
- Matilda!

412
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,000
- Matilda, my dear,
is a fighter.

413
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,920
The greatest fighter
in the world!

414
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,760
- A fighter?

415
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,920
But I wanna sing in Hollywood,
not Madison Square Garden.

416
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,680
- Tanya, believe me, this
is your ticket to greatness.

417
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,440
If I didn't think so, I'd
never take the 500 dollars.

418
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,280
- 500 dollars?

419
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,480
What 500 dollars?

420
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,640
- Don't worry, it's nothing.

421
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,320
It's just an advance
on next week's salary.

422
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,520
I'll get it from Sabuncakis.

423
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,760
You got two points in Matilda.

424
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,120
Think Hollywood.

425
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,120
- "Think Hollywood."

426
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,880
- Hey, that's Lee Dockerty
over there, isn't it?

427
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,120
What's he doing here?

428
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,240
- Oh yeah.

429
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,680
I don't know, how comes
in here everyday,

430
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,360
eyeballing me and sitting
there behind those dark glasses

431
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
and drinking beer.

432
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,240
- Tonya, you be nice to him.

433
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,320
You're gonna go out
with him tonight.

434
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,000
- Uh huh.

435
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,800
- We're in!

436
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,240
Come on, hit it.

437
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,080
All I need now is a boxing
license from the commissioner.

438
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,360
- Buffalo Bill?

439
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,600
Wildman?

440
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,080
He ain't gonna give you no
boxing license,

441
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,440
that crazy cowboy.

442
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,680
- Just stop at
a western store first.

443
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,040
I'll take care of all the rest.

444
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,280
- What part of Arizona
you say you're from?

445
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,560
- Family's got a spread
outside of Wickenburg.

446
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,240
- Well, what can I do for you?

447
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,480
- I need a license.

448
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,720
Billy's got a match
tomorrow night

449
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,360
and I want everything I
proper accord

450
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,880
with the high standards
of your office.

451
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,840
- Well, son, boxing's
been my life.

452
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,800
Anybody come around here
messing with the rules

453
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,400
trying to bust 'em gonna
have to answer to me.

454
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,000
- Commissioner, this
fight will be a credit

455
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,480
to you and the profession.

456
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,520
It's a classic battle between
experience against strength.

457
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,880
- Oh, you mean the other
boy is strong, huh?

458
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,560
- Matilda, he's an animal.

459
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,320
- Well, the champ, here,
looks looks like he's

460
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,480
about ready to ride
into the sunset.

461
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,800
- Oh, Billy, here, is
still a howling coyote.

462
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,760
Right, partner?

463
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,640
Woo!

464
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,520
- This fella, Matilda,

465
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,840
that's a strange name for a boy.

466
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,520
- Partner, he's a
wild-fighting critter.

467
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,320
He's a tough western boy.

468
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,600
Heck, fuzzy!

469
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,440
Woo!

470
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,680
- Well, heck fuzzy yourself!

471
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,760
With a name like Matilda,

472
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,720
he must've been
fighting all his life.

473
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,920
Unless he's strange.

474
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,640
Strange, if you know
what I mean?

475
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,880
- Matson's
Monster Carnival

476
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,960
is proud to present
our feature attraction!

477
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,920
- If you brought me out here
on a wild goose chase, Gordon,

478
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,800
so help me, I'll take you apart.

479
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,680
- Mr. Parkhurst, have I
ever give you a bad tip?

480
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,600
I'm telling you, Dockerty
is gonna be here tonight.

481
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,920
Fighting.

482
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,600
- That is absolutely
preposterous.

483
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,880
- Hurry, hurry, step right
up, ladies and gentlemen

484
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,640
and see the wild only
boxing kangaroo,

485
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,520
as trained by Captain
Billy Baker,

00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,280
"the Burmazi Kid,"

487
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,480
the Champion of all of
the British Isles!

488
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,280
Ladies and gentlemen!

489
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,960
Matson's Monster Carnival

490
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,440
is very proud to present

491
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,800
our feature attraction!

492
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,000
Captain Billy Baker

493
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,080
and the one and only Matilda!

494
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,120
Matilda will put on
an exhibition

495
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,400
unparalleled in the
anales of pugilism!

496
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,800
- It's almost human.

497
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,200
Just like I told you, huh, Mr.
Parkhurst?

498
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,960
I mean, your eyes don't lie,
look at it!

499
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,400
- Now,

500
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,240
for the coup de gras!

501
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,840
The special event of the night!

502
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,880
Matson's Monster Carnival

503
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,240
will give to anyone,

504
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,760
anyone that wants to
come up into this ring

505
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,400
and go two rounds with Matilda
without being knocked down,

506
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,640
we will give them 500 dollars.

507
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
500 dollars!

508
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,080
Matson's Carnival will
accept no responsibility

509
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,440
for injury or death!

510
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,240
So, if you wanna fight...

511
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,360
If you wanna fight, you
gotta come up into the ring

512
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,560
and sign a release!

513
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,960
- This must be a fake.

514
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,920
Tell 'em champ, they'll
listen to you, tell 'em!

515
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,440
- This is a setup!

516
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,320
- Do I gather that you
are challenging Matilda?!

517
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,000
- You bet your sweet
patootie I am!

518
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,400
- I don't believe it.

519
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,760
He's signing to fight
that kangaroo

520
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,000
and he wouldn't fight
Cyclone Roberts.

521
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,320
What a woman can get
a man to do.

522
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,920
- The last one to get
knocked down

523
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,440
must go to the farthest
corner, remain there until--

524
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,920
- That's the Heavyweight
Champion of the world.

525
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,040
You didn't tell me Matilda
would have to fight him.

526
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,080
- Relax, kid, everything's
gonna be all right.

527
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,600
- But he's all I've got.

528
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,720
- All right, shake hands!

529
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,960
- I don't want to let
him get hurt.

530
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,080
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

531
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,880
- Whoa!

532
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,440
- Two!

533
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,520
Three!

534
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,400
Four!

535
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,080
- Nobody
in the boxing world knew

536
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,600
that a big underworld
boss called Uncle Nono

537
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,960
owned the champ, Lee Dockerty.

538
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,160
He didn't like what
had happened.

539
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,320
- "Don't kiss me again!

540
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,320
"Your corespondent
witnessed an example of this

541
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,920
"when dropping Lee
Dockerty for the count.

542
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,240
"Matilda, deposited a moist kiss

543
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,640
"full on Lee's mouth.

544
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,000
"His trainer

545
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,880
"refers to it as the
kiss of death

546
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,120
"and prepares to...

547
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,680
"And prepares to sweep
up the remains

548
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,960
"with its recipient.

549
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,600
"Matilda of Australia,
new Heavyweight Champion,

550
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,280
"knocked out title

551
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,560
"in 37 seconds of the
first round!"

552
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,760
Then after stating

553
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,360
that Dockerty's manager
was not present,

554
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,560
Parkhurst hails the new champion

555
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,800
a boxer, a fighter

556
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,760
a kangaroo!

557
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,440
Ayuadame.

558
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,720
Ayuadame, help me, help me.

559
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,920
This does not make
Nono very happy.

560
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,120
- Listen, boss.

561
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,840
- Why did you let Dockerty
out of your sight?

562
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,440
That's what you're
being paid for.

563
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,800
To see that Parkhurst does
not get another chance

564
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,320
to write this kind of junk!

565
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,400
- Senor Macante.

566
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,600
- Boss,

567
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,880
please, please, believe me.

568
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,240
I didn't know that he
was desperate for a girl.

569
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,840
- And you!

570
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,960
Where were you?!

571
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,720
- Hey, I figured Pinky knew.

572
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,640
He works in the same
office with Bernie.

573
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,320
- I work for the same office?

574
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,800
That idiot is my brother-in-law,

575
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,480
otherwise I would've
thrown him out years ago!

576
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,600
You see, he was an orphan.

577
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,800
He never had a shot in
life and I was gonna give--

578
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,280
Dockerty gets flattened.

579
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,160
Macante thought this!

580
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,480
Your sister's brother
is an orphan

581
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,720
and he never got his shot!

582
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,360
Why is this?!

583
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,520
Imbeciles!

584
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,480
I'll tell you,

585
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,840
the next time this kind
of thing happens again,

586
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,760
all of your kids are gonna be
orphans, is that understood?

587
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,240
- Well, you're my lawyer,
do something!

588
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,760
What're you doing?

589
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,920
- I'm throwing your junk
out of my office!

590
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,080
You, Bernie Bonnelli,
are a Judas!

591
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,560
- Marty, stay right
there, I'll call you back.

592
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,440
Would you mind explaining
the meaning of this?

593
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
- The meaning is simple.

594
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
I'm gonna kill you.

595
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,080
- Wait, the boss don't
want no one hit.

596
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,320
- Shut up, you nitwit!

597
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,120
- Listen, don't scare
me with your numbers.

598
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,280
Bernie don't scare!

599
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,760
This is ridiculous, you
can't put this stuff

600
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,120
out here in the hallway
and just leave it!

601
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,200
- We're not!

602
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,960
We're gonna burn it with
you on the top!

603
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,960
- Be nice or I won't give
you a rematch.

604
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,960
- What do you mean, rematch?!

605
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,320
There was never a match.

606
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,840
It was only some dopey
publicity stunt you dreamed up!

607
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,680
- Yeah!

608
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,640
- Be careful, Bernie!

609
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,440
You are getting the
wrong peoples mad.

610
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,040
- What's Parkhurst
wanna see me about?

611
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,720
- I don't know but when
Parkhurst wants to see you,

612
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,920
you go, not later, not
tomorrow but now.

613
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,920
- If it's important, it's
gotta be something good, right?

614
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,120
- Hello, Betty.

615
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,000
This is Bernie Bonnelli.

616
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,320
Mr. Parkhurst wants to see him.

617
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,520
- He's waiting, please go in.

618
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,080
Gordon, Mr. Parkhurst wants
to see him in private.

619
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,080
- Sit down.

620
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,920
- I'm Bernie Bonnelli.

621
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,280
Matilda's manager.

622
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,480
- Yeah, I know who you are,
that's why you're here.

623
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,800
- Okay, what do you want?

624
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,240
- Do you know who owns Dockerty?

625
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,800
- Pinky Schwab and a
couple other guys.

626
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,600
- Pink Schwab is just one
step below of being a moron.

627
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,800
Uncle Nono owns Dockerty, kid.

628
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,800
He's the biggest gangster
in the United States

629
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,200
and I'm going to put him
put of boxing for good.

630
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,680
- What's that gotta do with me?

631
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,400
- You and Billy Baker
have a good thing going

632
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,680
with Matilda right now but so
far it's just a circus act.

633
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,520
But I'm going to make it better.

634
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,360
You do what I tell you,

635
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,520
you'll make money and I'll
get Uncle Nono.

636
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,720
- I got a feeling you
get Nono, I get buried.

637
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,520
- That's the gamble
you're gonna have to take

638
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,600
if you wanna make a
million bucks.

639
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,520
- A million bucks?!

640
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,640
- That's what it's worth

641
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,520
to get Dockerty in the
ring with Matilda.

642
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,680
You interested?

643
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,400
- Is Rolls interested in Royce?

644
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,240
- Okay.

645
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,480
Now you arrange the fights,

646
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,720
I write about them.

647
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,040
Nobody knows about our deal.

648
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,560
So when Nono comes down on you,

649
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,280
you keep your mouth
shut, you don't call me.

650
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,400
We understand each other?

651
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,640
- You got yourself a deal, Mr.
Parkhurst.

652
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,920
- Oh, incidentally,
very important,

653
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,800
you take care of Kathleen
Smith and the ASPCA first.

654
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,320
I hear on the grape vine that
she's taking you to court.

655
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,720
- She is being taken care
of immediately.

656
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,040
- Are you sure
this is the place?

657
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,280
- Sure I'm sure,
can't you read English?

658
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,440
- Don't get mad,
I'm only asking.

659
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,560
- Come on, come on, good dogs.

660
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,480
Come on, come on, come on.

661
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,440
Come on, sweetie.

662
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,400
Hey.

663
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,400
Come on, come one,
what a nice dog.

664
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,480
- Come on, Charlie.

665
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,160
- Hi!

666
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,200
Fancy meeting you out here.

667
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,360
Do you live here?

668
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,440
I walk down this
street every day.

669
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,200
Hello.

670
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,640
- How nice, Mr. Bonnelli.

671
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,520
- This is the part of the
day I always look forward to,

672
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,000
to be with my animals.

673
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,400
They're mostly strays
I picked up.

674
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,240
I can't stand to see an
animal suffer.

675
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,840
- Mr. Bonnelli, why do I
get this feeling

676
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,120
there's something you're
trying so hard to tell me?

677
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,680
- Miss Smith, you've
got me wrong.

678
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,080
When I wanna tell
somebody something,

679
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,120
I tell them straight out.

680
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,480
Like the whole Matilda thing.

681
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,560
Do you really think
that I would ever, ever

682
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,800
let anybody hurt him?

683
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
I mean, that kangaroo's
like family to me.

684
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,840
- Family?

685
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,720
People don't exploit
their family.

686
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,080
- But who's exploiting anybody?

687
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,200
Do you think anyone can
teach a kangaroo to fight?

688
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,800
No way, it's a natural thing.

689
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,000
It's their sex drive.

690
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,040
God gave it to them just
like He gave it to us.

691
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,400
They fight and we...

692
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,200
How tall are you?

693
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,360
- What?

694
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,880
- I mean, you sure got long
legs for a lady your size,

695
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,080
you know that?

696
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,800
- My injunction is
going to stand.

697
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,640
Matilda is not going
to fight again.

698
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,640
Will you excuse me, please?

699
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,760
- Miss Smith, listen to me!

700
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,760
Ow, ow, ow!

701
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,520
Oh, you bit me, ow!

702
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,840
- Sit down.

703
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,760
Come on, sit.

704
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,240
Here, hold Charlie.

705
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,400
Let's take the shoe off.

706
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,240
No, we must take the shoe off

707
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,320
to see if the skin is broke.

708
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,600
- No, it's nothing, really.

709
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,840
- My goodness.

710
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,960
Why am I so disappointed

711
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,280
that you are not bleeding, Mr.
Bonnelli?

712
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,720
- What?

713
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,840
- You know, it's just amazing
that for a man your size,

714
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,000
your legs are so ugly.

715
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,560
That must do terrible
things for your ego.

716
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,880
Can I have Charlie, please?

717
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,240
- What are you, some
kind of sadist working

718
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,200
for the Prevention of
Cruelty for Animals?

719
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,400
- I can tell you this,
I've never been so inspired

720
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,760
to stop anyone as I am now, Mr.
Bonnelli.

721
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,240
Oh,

722
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,760
here boys.

723
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,640
Here, fellas.

724
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,880
Fetch!

725
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,520
- What're you doing?

726
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,480
What're you, crazy?!

727
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,040
- Fetch, Bonnelli.

728
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,440
Fetch.

729
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,920
- You know what that was
all about, don't you?

730
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,280
- Yeah, guess she didn't
go for it, huh?

731
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,280
- You think she really cares
about stopping a fight?

732
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,680
That's her way to
sticking it to my life

733
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,160
and you know something?

734
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,880
I don't think she can fight
it, what do you think of that?

735
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
Ugly legs.

736
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,360
- Who?

737
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,480
- Well Miss Smith is gonna
have to learn the hard way.

738
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,160
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

739
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,000
We'll be gone, fighting
around the country,

740
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,920
while my long-legged
friend spends her life

741
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,400
trying to get an
injunction against us

742
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,840
in every state in the Union.

743
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,680
Gordon, partner,

744
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,680
you ever think of
selling this cab?

745
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,480
- For
the next six months,

746
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,240
we crisscrossed the
United States taking on

747
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,160
every contender for the title.

748
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,160
Slowly working our way
to a championship fight.

749
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,560
We went to some very
strange places.

750
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,840
Tuskaloosa, Chattanooga.

751
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,640
Tallahassee,

752
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,240
Albuquerque,

753
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,640
Indianapolis,

754
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,200
Minneapolis.

755
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,440
We had seven fights

756
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,520
and Matilda killed 'em
all in the first round.

757
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,680
It was very tiring but
it was all happy

758
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,840
being one family, so to speak.

759
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,240
Bernie, bless his heart,

760
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,080
was saving some money for us all

761
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,240
but he always insisted, even
though we didn't spend a lot,

762
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,760
we always ate good.

763
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,600
- Thanks.

764
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,640
- Oh, just a minute, sir.

765
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,000
- Oh.

766
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,480
That's a sundae for Matilda.

767
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,600
- Thank you, come back again.

768
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,240
- I want chocolate.

769
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,120
- Hello.

770
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,320
What're you doing?

771
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,840
What are you doing?

772
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,800
- Do you really think you could
stop me by leaving New York?

773
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,680
- I tried calling to say
goodbye but your phone was busy.

774
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,680
- Oh, well why didn't
you write me a letter?

775
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,840
I got the bill for your shoes.

776
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,680
- Well, those were
Bally loafers.

777
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,600
- Oh, well, they only ate one.

778
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,480
- I'm sorry.

779
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,040
Eat one, you gotta pay for two.

780
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,880
Did you follow me to Oklahoma?

781
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,720
- Don't flatter yourself.

782
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,040
Been down at the state capital
trying to get an injunction

783
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,680
to stop this fight.

784
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,560
- Oh.

785
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,680
- They
wouldn't grant it.

786
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,520
- Oh.

787
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,520
- I read in the papers

788
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,840
where your next fight is
in Los Angeles.

789
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,640
- Yeah, that's right, why?

790
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,680
- Oh, my brother's the
boxing commissioner

791
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,400
of the state of California.

792
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,040
Come in!

793
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,120
Just leave it there in
the front room, please.

794
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,600
Get out!

795
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,760
- Listen, I want to be friends.

796
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,960
Can we be friends?

797
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,560
- No, get out!

798
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,640
- Most women, when they
come out of the shower

799
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,960
and they're in a bathrobe
and their hair's like that

800
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,240
are supposed to look
pretty but they never do.

801
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,320
You

802
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,200
do.

803
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,360
It's not great but
it's friendly.

804
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,240
Here.

805
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,720
It's not great but
it's friendly.

806
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:29,000
- I never thought that it
was possible to hate anybody

807
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,520
as much as I hate you but I
have achieved the impossible.

808
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,080
When are you gonna give it up?!

809
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,840
- It's great but it's
not friendly.

810
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,560
- I have this curious notion
that you have come up here

811
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,760
to try and tell me something

812
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,880
and you just don't know
quite how to say it.

813
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,920
- I'm not kidding, I
wanna be friends.

814
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,440
- Oh, is it my
irresistible beauty

815
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,880
or does it have something
to do with the fact

816
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,120
that my brother is the head of

817
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,200
the boxing commission
of California?

818
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,360
- The honest answer to that
is "yes to both," why not?

819
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,440
I'm fighting for the life
of a man and a marsupial

820
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,000
that I give a damn about.

821
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,680
Someday, if we really get
to be friends,

822
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,120
I'll tell you about what
I think of the

823
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,240
prevention of cruelty to people.

824
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,640
You keep talking
about marsupials.

825
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,720
Did you happen to see my
English friend

826
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,520
who was once Welterweight
Champion of England?

827
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,760
That's important, lady!

828
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,760
I don't think you understand
how important that is,

829
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,920
that a man who was
Welterweight Champion

830
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,560
is suddenly walking on his
knees starving to death

831
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,120
and has nothing but a one-way
ticket to the poor house.

832
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,240
That might not mean
anything to you

833
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,200
but it means something to me!

834
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,440
Here.

835
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,840
Have a shoe.

836
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,440
I'll send you a bill
in the morning.

837
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,360
- Okay, we
throw a net over the beast

838
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,880
and this time we kidnap him!

839
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,120
- Even if we
kidnap the kangaroo,

840
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,480
how're we gonna get them
in this trunk?

841
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,960
- He's no bigger than a body.

842
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,120
You, are you sure it's gonna
be here, this kangaroo?

843
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,200
- I told you for the last time,

844
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,320
he comes up and down this trail.

845
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,000
- Well I'm just checking, I
don't want no more trouble!

846
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,840
Now go!
- Come on.

847
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,080
- I hope this
works because if it doesn't,

848
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,040
the boss finds out, it's
concrete Keds for us.

849
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,720
- Come on, would you
please hurry up?!

850
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:47,560
- All right,
all right, all right!

851
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,520
- When I give the signal,
drop it right here!

852
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,480
- All right, we hear you!

853
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,160
Only a moron would try
to kidnap this beast.

854
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,440
This is ridiculous!

855
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,200
- Throw it!

856
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,760
What is this beast?

857
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
He's killin', he choking me!

858
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,080
Help, he's choke!

859
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,400
- We gotta get Macante out!

860
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,520
- What's the problem?

861
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,360
Simple!

862
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,280
Ow!

863
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,120
Get me out of this!

864
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,440
Ow, you idiot,
what're you doing?!

865
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,160
- Stupid, hit the one
with the big ears!

866
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,560
- I'll hit you in your big ears!

867
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,040
- I'm gonna feel around,

868
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,840
when I don't feel no fur,

869
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,520
Tito's gonna lift up the net
and we're gonna let you out!

870
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,560
Capeesh?!

871
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,000
- All right, get out, get out!

872
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,080
- Hey, I'm
still in here!

873
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,040
Hey, you!

874
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,000
- Move! Move!

875
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,840
Let's get out of here!

876
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,120
Go! Go! Go! Go!

877
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,960
- Ladies and gentleman,
your attention please,

878
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,480
this is the main event
of the evening.

879
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,160
10 rounds of heavyweight boxing.

880
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,760
Introducing to you first,

881
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,240
at a hundred and 87 pounds,

882
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,160
from Sydney, Australia,
the great Matilda!

883
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,560
And in this corner,

884
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,360
wearing blue trunks with
the gold stripes,

885
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,160
one hundred and 96 and
a half pounds,

886
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,200
from Stillwater, Oklahoma,

887
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,360
the number two champion
in the world,

888
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,320
Cowboy Joe!

889
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,280
- Bernie, I hope
you don't mind,

890
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,560
but when you see Miss Kathleen's
brother, don't upset him.

891
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,360
If we don't get the
license for the fight,

892
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,240
we've come all this way
to California for nothing.

893
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,600
- You propose to stage a
ten round fight

894
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,160
between a former
Middleweight Champion,

895
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,440
Cyclone Roberts of Peoria,

896
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,760
and a kangaroo?

897
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,520
- That's right.

898
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:52,600
- And you're asking us to
issue a license for this?

899
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,120
What do you take us for, Mr.
Bonnelli?

900
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,240
- I'm not talking
anybody for anything.

901
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,800
My fighter, Matilda, ain't
no ordinary kangaroo.

902
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,920
Knocked out Lee Dockerty
and 11 other guys.

903
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,200
He's licensed in 10 states
and is a serious contender

904
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,360
for the championship.

905
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,640
- You won't get a license
in California.

906
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,120
- Why not?

907
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,680
- We'll not allow that kind
of a freak show in this state.

908
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,680
Take your circus and
get out of town.

909
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,640
- I told your sister
and now I'm telling you,

910
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:31,080
you don't run this world
because you don't own it!

911
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:43,520
Who do those people
think they are?

912
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,480
"Freak show."

913
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,600
I ain't been around
all these years

914
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,680
to have that brother and
sister act stop us now.

915
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,960
Nothing, nothing stops Bonnelli!

916
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,280
Take me to Herman Caplin.

917
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,480
- Who's Herman Caplin?

918
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,480
- A friend.

919
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,280
- What does he do,
Bernie?

920
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,080
- He runs a big
advertising agency.

921
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,240
I did it, I did it, I did it!

922
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,760
We are gonna be on TV.

923
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,920
I sold the television show to
my old friend, Herman Caplin!

924
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,800
- A television show?

925
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,800
- Right!

926
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,400
Matilda boxes Cyclone
on the show.

927
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,120
It's a phony story but
everybody knows

928
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,320
the fight's for real
in the studio

929
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,440
and they get into the ring.

930
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,480
- Oh, Bernie, you're
infinitely special.

931
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,720
- Do you know something?
- What?

932
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,000
- I should've been a
genius or something.

933
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,560
- You mean a TV show

934
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,800
that has the real fight in it,
huh?

935
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,240
That's terrific!

936
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,480
- All right.

937
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,400
I'm gonna teach you the
advantages of an education.

938
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,680
Come on.

939
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,040
All right.

940
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,400
Now,

941
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,520
here we have our champ,
Dockerty.

942
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,040
Observe.

943
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,960
He is a human being.

944
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,840
He has two legs, huh?

945
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,280
See the dots?

946
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,480
One.

947
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,360
Two.

948
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,320
Repeat.

949
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,640
- One.

950
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,480
Two.

951
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,160
- All right, now here
we have our kangaroo.

952
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,640
Now, can you tell me
the difference, Macante?

953
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,520
Huh?

954
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,400
- He's got a tail.

955
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,440
- That's beautiful, Macante!

956
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,400
That's beautiful, beautiful!

957
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,080
All right!

958
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,960
But not just a tail,
not just a tail!

959
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,360
Bernardo, what else do you see?

960
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,400
- Yeah,

961
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,920
he's got a long tail.

962
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,640
- No, you stupid...

963
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,080
What else do you see?

964
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,760
- Oh.

965
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,120
He's got skinny legs.

966
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,320
- No, you idiot!

967
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,240
He's got an extra dot!

968
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,680
He's got three dots!

969
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,040
This kangaroo's been
fighting with three dots!

970
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,640
One, two, three!

971
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,760
- One, two, three.

972
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,560
- While Dockerty's only
fighting with two dots.

973
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,600
One, two.

974
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,480
- One, two.

975
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,640
- That ain't fair, I'm
gonna call the commissioner.

976
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,640
- And what're you gonna
tell the commissioner?

977
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,400
- About the extra dot.

978
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,880
- No, you stupid!

979
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,440
You cut off the head of a
snake and the body dies.

980
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,760
You cut off the tail
of a kangaroo

981
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,600
and what happens?

982
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,800
Well, come on, what happens?!

983
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,680
Huh?

984
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,920
He looses his dot.

985
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,640
His extra dot!

986
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,840
He falls down, he can't
fight anymore.

987
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,920
You understand?

988
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,120
Do you understand or am
I talking to myself?!

989
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,880
- Oh yeah, no, we
understand, he falls down!

990
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,680
- Oh!

991
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,480
- Boss,

992
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,520
are we really gonna put
out a contract

993
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,240
to cut off the kangaroo's tail?

994
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,560
- Boss.

995
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,240
Please, no disrespect intended.

996
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,440
Who am I gonna get to do this?

997
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,080
A butcher?

998
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:28,960
- No.

999
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,200
Two of my best men.

1000
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,000
Both of you are gonna go
to Los Angeles

1001
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,000
and you're gonna chop it off!

1002
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,480
- Miss Smith
thought she was gonna get

1003
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,000
her little brother to stop
Bernie Bonnelli, ha, ha!

1004
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,440
Well, would you like to
see their faces

1005
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,400
when they see Matilda fight
Cyclone on TV, nationwide?!

1006
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,600
- Dear Bernie,

1007
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,120
I'm sorry the fight
was called off.

1008
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,080
Can I buy you dinner?

1009
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,200
Can we be friends?

1010
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,320
- Hello?

1011
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,360
- Hello, Billy,

1012
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,480
listen, Billy, we
don't eat tonight.

1013
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,080
- We don't?

1014
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,360
- Together.

1015
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,800
I've been invited upstairs
to eat by Miss Smith.

1016
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,000
She's feeling guilty and
I'm going to her room now

1017
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,760
to make her meal
even more guilty

1018
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,080
because she things she
ruined our chances.

1019
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,680
Sweet dreams to you, Gordon
and Matilda, goodnight.

1020
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,840
Forgive me but if the
shoes fits...

1021
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:45,760
- Come in.

1022
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,120
Please, come in.

1023
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,840
Are you all right?

1024
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,960
Would you like something to eat?

1025
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
- I don't wanna eat.

1026
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,440
- Drink?

1027
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,280
Maybe you'd like
something to drink.

1028
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,880
- What difference does it make?

1029
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,720
- I've never seen you like this.

1030
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,240
Your voice is even different.

1031
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,640
Here.

1032
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:31,520
Here.

1033
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,280
I'll take the shoe.

1034
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,160
No, it's all right,
I'll give it back later

1035
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,960
and you can take it home.

1036
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:40,840
It's okay.

1037
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,080
- I'm a bum again.

1038
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,760
I'm on the outside looking in.

1039
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,000
I'm nothing.

1040
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,320
I'm a loser.

1041
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,240
- Oh,

1042
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,920
Lord,

1043
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,880
Bernie, you're
anything but a loser.

1044
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,720
You are the most amazing man
I have ever met in my life.

1045
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,120
Oh, Bernie.

1046
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,160
I've never seen a man
with such energy.

1047
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,840
And I've never seen a man
who tried with all his might

1048
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,280
to obtain the impossible.

1049
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:22,520
And, you know,

1050
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,240
you know, you almost succeeded.

1051
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,760
Don't you realize how
truly great you are?

1052
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,560
- I'm not thinking too clearly.

1053
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,680
I have a terrible headache.

1054
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,720
- Oh, a headache.

1055
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,920
- As a matter of fact,
my whole neck.

1056
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,200
- Oh, your neck?

1057
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,080
- And my whole back.

1058
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,840
- Your back too?

1059
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:50,680
- Oh yes.

1060
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:51,600
Ah.

1061
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:52,480
Oh.

1062
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,360
Oh.

1063
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,520
Oh, I'll tell you something,
Miss Smith.

1064
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,360
- Yes?

1065
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,600
- You're in another world.

1066
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:04,480
You don't understand, I
get a chance like this

1067
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,720
once in a lifetime.

1068
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,880
It's gone, you don't get two
chances at something like this.

1069
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,760
Oh.

1070
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,360
Ah.

1071
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,640
Can I have another drink,
please?

1072
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:26,000
- Sure.

1073
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,920
Bernie, I think
you've had enough.

1074
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,200
- God, if you only knew
what I have to go though.

1075
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,280
I mean, I don't have any money

1076
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,360
and Billy's ruined and
Matilda's ruined

1077
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,440
and it's all my fault.

1078
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,320
- Oh, no.

1079
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,240
Bernie, no.

1080
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,720
It's the opposite,
absolutely the opposite.

1081
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,400
Here, sit up.

1082
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,120
Oh, Bernie, it's because
of you that they existed,

1083
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,240
that they even had the chance.

1084
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,680
They even had the chance.

1085
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,440
- But they don't have any
chance anymore, don't you see?

1086
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,640
- Oh, no, no.

1087
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,320
I think you should just relax.

1088
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,600
Just relax for a little while.

1089
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,960
Okay?

1090
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,280
Oh.

1091
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,080
That's it.

1092
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,040
Just relax.

1093
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,160
Relax.

1094
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,560
- Here they come.

1095
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,960
Now remember,

1096
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,520
when I ask the animal for
his autograph,

1097
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,760
you got just enough time
to do what you gotta do.

1098
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,920
Think, we get in the car,
we're gone

1099
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,320
and the dot's gone.

1100
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,560
Capeesh?

1101
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,520
- I know what I'm
supposed to do.

1102
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,960
- I'm just checking.

1103
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,280
Why you always get upset
about everything?

1104
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,200
- When I'm through,

1105
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,800
the kangaroo's too.

1106
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:09,960
- I love you.

1107
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:17,760
Excuse me.

1108
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,440
Gentlemen?

1109
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,640
Excuse me, please, somebody?

1110
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:28,280
I'd like to get his autograph,
please?

1111
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,440
It's for my kid.

1112
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,600
- Oh, oh.

1113
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,680
- I really
would appreciate it.

1114
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,120
- Sign here.

1115
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,800
- Thanks a lot,
really.

1116
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,320
I really appreciated that.

1117
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,240
- Ah, look at you.

1118
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,360
- Bernie's
idea of doing a show

1119
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
where Matilda fights
Cyclone Roberts

1120
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,600
was my debut as an actor.

1121
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,760
And if I must say so myself,

1122
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,120
it was a milestone in
television history.

1123
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,200
- Oh!

1124
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,200
- He's our Matilda

1125
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:13,440
that we saved in the desert
when he was just a little roo.

1126
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,280
- Maybe
he'll pay us back

1127
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,720
by fighting that mean
Cyclone Roberts.

1128
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,560
- Do you believe this?

1129
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,960
Do you believe this?

1130
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,560
- Pardon me, ma'am, you
saved his life...

1131
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,680
Too.

1132
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,880
- Dear Matilda
agreed to fight Cyclone Roberts

1133
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,400
and give his share of the purse.

1134
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,600
- Okay, switch
cameras to the ring.

1135
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,120
And here we are, live,
from Olympia Auditorium

1136
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,200
where the boxing event
you've all been waiting for

1137
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,280
is about to begin!

1138
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:46,480
Matilda vs. Cyclone Roberts!

1139
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,480
He knows Matilda can hit.

1140
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,400
He throws a jab.

1141
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,440
Way short.

1142
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,040
Cyclone dancing around now.

1143
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:57,160
Cyclone steps up.

1144
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,480
Pulls a jab, Matilda comes back.

1145
00:57:58,520 --> 00:57:59,560
What a devastating
hook to the head!

1146
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,720
Cyclone is down!

1147
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,840
The referee is counting

1148
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,840
but it's a waste of time.

1149
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,520
Cyclone is out cold!

1150
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,040
That's it, it's all over.

1151
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,240
Once again, Matilda has
stopped his opponent

1152
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,320
in the first round!

1153
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,280
Listen to that crowd,
they love it!

1154
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,040
- Ah, the great Bernie Bonnelli.

1155
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,480
The rope burner, the world
beater, the impresario!

1156
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,800
- This is Billy Baker,
the Burmazi Kid.

1157
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,080
- Glad to know you.

1158
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,240
You know, I used to think
you were just a hustler,

1159
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:50,920
but I guess I was wrong.

1160
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,880
- Coming from you, that
scares me, what's up?

1161
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,160
Why did you have us fly back?

1162
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,280
- Good news and bad news.

1163
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,960
The championship fight
is on in Reno.

1164
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,600
Congratulations.

1165
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,640
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

1166
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,200
- We've done it, Bernie,
we've done it!

1167
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,680
- Bad news is, you're
all working for free.

1168
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:07,960
- Free?

1169
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,880
- You heard me, for free.

1170
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,240
Nobody gets anything except

1171
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,880
the Free Food Fund for
Hungry Children in New York.

1172
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,320
- But what about
hungry trainer

1173
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,800
and a hungry manager?

1174
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,320
- Listen,

1175
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,280
I've been waiting for five years

1176
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,480
for the chance to
nail Uncle Nono

1177
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,640
and this is the only way
I could make it work.

1178
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,560
Give the entire gate to charity.

1179
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,720
He had to agree to the
match or else he'd be bared

1180
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:32,800
from ever promoting another
match anywhere in this country.

1181
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,320
- Well when did all this happen?

1182
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,640
- Just a little while ago.

1183
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,480
I figure when things got tough,

1184
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,600
the thought of a million
bucks would keep you going.

1185
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,480
- Well thank you, we finally
make it over the rainbow

1186
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,920
to find out that the
pot's empty!

1187
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,000
- Bonnelli, look,

1188
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,600
after this fight,
everything is yours.

1189
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:47,920
But for now,

1190
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,800
I'm gonna give you a chance
for once in your life

1191
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,320
to do the right thing.

1192
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,480
Help somebody else.

1193
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,960
- What did you ever give away,
Duke?

1194
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,280
A few funny lines to some guy
who got his head handed to him

1195
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,400
in the loosing end of a fight

1196
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,280
so you could sell
some more papers?

1197
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,440
Billy, Mr. Parkhurst,
here, knew all the time

1198
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,960
that I would go along with it.

1199
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,960
He could spot a sucker like me
a mile away, chasing a dream,

1200
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,080
but I ain't talking for
you or Matilda.

1201
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,520
- Well...

1202
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,360
Well, it's whatever you say,
Bernie.

1203
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,920
You're the only one that's ever
been nice to Matilda and me.

1204
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,680
- It's gonna be Matilda's
toughest fight.

1205
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,480
But the man's right about
cleaning up the sport

1206
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,440
and helping the kids.

1207
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,840
- Well it's all right by
Matilda and me

1208
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:33,280
if you say so, Bernie.

1209
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,040
You'd never do
anything wrong to us.

1210
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:40,960
- Mr. Parkhurst,

1211
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,320
you've got yourself the fight
of the century to write about.

1212
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,200
- We trained
hard from early morning

1213
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,320
till late every day.

1214
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,920
But the champ was
training hard too.

1215
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,560
He was determined Matilda
wouldn't win this fight.

1216
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,720
It was gonna be the fight
of Lee Dockerty's life.

1217
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,720
Tanya felt badly after what
had happened to Dockerty

1218
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,800
at the carnival and she
became Lee's greatest fan.

1219
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,400
- Great, champ!

1220
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,000
You're looking great.

1221
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,120
- He deserves it.

1222
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,520
Everything okay, Harry?

1223
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,720
- Fine, Mr. Bonnelli, all
peace and quiet.

1224
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,720
- Look, I just came in here

1225
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,560
to see if you were all right,
champ.

1226
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,320
You funny beast.

1227
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,160
Matilda.

1228
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,800
Matilda, where are you
coming from, Matilda?

1229
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,440
Who made you?

1230
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,360
And why?

1231
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,720
Why?

1232
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,880
Why should you, the most
funny-looking put together

1233
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,080
animal in the world,
have this great talent?

1234
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,560
Has the spirit of Dempsey and
Sugar Ray entered your body?

1235
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,320
But why you, Matilda?

1236
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:40,680
Other kangaroos are in circuses
and zoos and carnivals,

1237
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,920
but never, no one, no
one like you.

1238
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,760
You're going along with
what started out as a gag

1239
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,320
and now laughing your head off?

1240
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:54,680
But whatever it is, there's
something I wanna say.

1241
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:57,960
No matter how we make out,

1242
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
you and Billy are winners

1243
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,720
and for the first
time in my life,

1244
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,160
you've made me a winner too.

1245
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,240
Thanks.

1246
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:47,920
- Hey.

1247
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,800
- Oh, hello.

1248
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,600
Happy to see you.

1249
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,800
- How you been?

1250
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:54,360
- Oh, I've been fine,
how are you?

1251
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,400
- Everything's fine?

1252
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,000
- Yeah, everything is wonderful.

1253
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,040
- Bern.

1254
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:03,880
The car.

1255
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,120
- Yeah, get in.

1256
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,240
- Ha, ha, ha.

1257
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,320
- Come on, Bern, in the car.

1258
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,640
- This is a nice car.

1259
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,480
Are we going for a ride?

1260
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,440
- Hey, paesano,
relax.

1261
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,960
You want a drink?

1262
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,120
- Yeah,
turn on the TV.

1263
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:34,080
- Now look, kid, this could be
a short night if you're smart

1264
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,240
or it could be a longer
one if you're not.

1265
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,680
Come here.

1266
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,280
You, Bonnelli, you've
caused me a lot of grief.

1267
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,080
You've taken apart an
organization

1268
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,760
that's taken me
years to develop.

1269
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,400
My men, they're morons.

1270
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,240
So, Uncle Nono has to take
care of business himself.

1271
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:11,400
This is for you.

1272
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:15,720
I've already signed it.

1273
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,560
You are now the owner
of Lee Dockerty

1274
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,160
after the fight tomorrow night.

1275
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,640
This one, here, you sign.

1276
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,480
And I own Matilda at
the same time.

1277
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,080
You wanna sign?

1278
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,160
- You ain't thinking clear.

1279
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,280
Kill me and Billy makes
Matilda fight anyways.

1280
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,160
You can't win.

1281
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,360
- When we get through with you,

1282
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,880
we're going back to that camp

1283
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,040
and we whack out of the
Englishman and the kangaroo.

1284
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,200
- Even you couldn't
take the heat

1285
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,520
that would come down after that.

1286
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,040
Uh-uh.

1287
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,320
Uh-uh.

1288
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,760
You didn't get to the top
doing stuff like that.

1289
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,480
Them, maybe, but not you.

1290
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,600
- You're all right, kid.

1291
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,840
I like you, like your style.

1292
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,680
If you ever decide to get
out of the boxing racket,

1293
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,520
you got a position with
me and my organization.

1294
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,800
- Uh-uh.

1295
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:25,840
- No, no, no, I mean it,
strictly legit.

1296
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,720
Straight.

1297
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,240
I own 45 different businesses

1298
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,720
between manufacturing and

1299
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,720
leisure time activities.

1300
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,560
- Are they your board
of directors?

1301
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,640
- You gotta
understand one thing,

1302
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:41,160
business is business

1303
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,040
but that does not
include boxing.

1304
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:44,920
Boxing is my hobby.

1305
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,560
- You're really just a
sportsman at heart.

1306
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,680
- Yeah.

1307
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,480
I mean, what's wrong with
wanting to own

1308
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,960
a heavyweight champ?

1309
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,040
Tell me.

1310
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,240
Vanderbilt would like to own

1311
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,440
a winning horse in the Derby,
right?

1312
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:57,480
Why not?

1313
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,360
- They work it another way.

1314
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:00,880
- Work?

1315
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,960
Come on, they never worked
an honest day in their life.

1316
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,720
They bought the best
their money could buy.

1317
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,600
It's the American way.

1318
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,640
That's what our parents
came here for.

1319
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:12,480
And don't you forget it.

1320
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:15,320
All right, take Mr.
Bonnelli back.

1321
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,120
No hard feelings, kid.

1322
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,800
- No.

1323
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,480
I'll see you.

1324
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:34,840
- Hey, Macante.

1325
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,040
I want you to call Reno
and tell them

1326
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:46,920
I want to lay a million dollars
on the kangaroo tomorrow.

1327
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,800
- Boss,

1328
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,920
that's a lot of money.

1329
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,400
- Would you do what I tell you?

1330
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,200
- American
Airlines flight 42

1331
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:14,520
from Mexico City and Acapulco
arriving at gate six.

1332
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:17,120
Flight 19 from Sydney,
Melbourne and Tokyo,

1333
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,320
arriving at gate nine.

1334
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,440
- Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen!

1335
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,840
I'm John Dunphy, your
ringside commentator,

1336
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,320
welcoming you from Paris
Hotel in Reno,

1337
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,080
on a cool, crisp evening for

1338
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,800
the Lee Dockerty/Matilda fight
for the Heavyweight crown.

1339
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,000
They're all here!

1340
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,360
The wealthy, the near wealthy,

1341
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,320
the politicians, the
stage and screen stars

1342
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:43,640
and of course, the sportsmen!

1343
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:46,440
A cross section of the
rich and powerful

1344
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:47,360
from all over the globe.

1345
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:49,840
They've traveled
thousands of miles

1346
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,760
to see this little
square above me,

1347
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,120
where, here in a few moments,

1348
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,320
probably the two finest
fighting machine of all time

1349
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,120
are going to meet each other.

1350
01:08:58,160 --> 01:08:59,480
But ladies and gentlemen,

1351
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,880
never have the championship
fights been so clouded

1352
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:03,360
by rumors.

1353
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,920
There's a report that both camps
have bought off the judges,

1354
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,520
that Dockerty is terrified

1355
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,440
and plans to take a dive
right after the opening bell.

1356
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,320
There's a report that
somebody's been doping

1357
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:15,000
Matilda's breakfast food!

1358
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,240
And another has it
that Lee Dockerty

1359
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:19,160
has hurt his left
hand in sparing

1360
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,960
and is going to take a dive
right after the opening bell.

1361
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,120
- Hey, Duke, how are you?

1362
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,320
Who do you like?

1363
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,320
- I don't guess you
read my column.

1364
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,040
Matilda in two.

1365
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,480
- Could be.

1366
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,800
I saw the rerun of the last
fight in Chicago on TV.

1367
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,120
- Are you betting?

1368
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:40,120
- No, I don't bet fights.

1369
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:41,080
Congratulations.

1370
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,840
- And here
comes the champion

1371
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:45,880
from the far corner of
the Colosseum.

1372
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,000
Lee Dockerty, the Heavyweight
Champion of the World

1373
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,160
is on his way to the ring!

1374
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,760
And there's a mixed
reaction from the crowd.

1375
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,120
A lot of them were for him.

1376
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,240
- Billy, what's wrong?

1377
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,080
I don't know how to tell you.

1378
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,680
I know I should've
told you before.

1379
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,200
- Well come on, nothing
could be that bad.

1380
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,560
We made it to the top,
didn't we?

1381
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,440
- Yeah!

1382
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:10,760
- Bernie,

1383
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,960
if a kangaroo is hit,
he won't fight anymore.

1384
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,320
- You told me they box
natural in their wild state,

1385
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:24,520
that he was merely using what
they did natural for the act.

1386
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,240
- That's right, they do.

1387
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,680
But it's not boxing
as we know it.

1388
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,360
When kangaroos box,

1389
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,440
they don't do it to
hurt each other.

1390
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,680
The one that gets the
first wallop wins.

1391
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,560
The other one stops right
there and then

1392
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,280
and he'll never fight again.

1393
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,640
- Matilda flattened the champ,
didn't he?

1394
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:48,120
- Dockerty had had a
few drinks that night.

1395
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,040
Matilda nailed him,
you know that.

1396
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,720
Cyclone and Cowboy Jones?

1397
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,320
- I knew they were washed up.

1398
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,320
We were all lucky.

1399
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,280
Dockerty is not drunk tonight.

1400
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,240
And unless Matilda
gets him first,

1401
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:12,840
Dockerty's gonna take him apart.

1402
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:18,000
- I've never seen Lee Dockerty
in such wonderful condition.

1403
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:20,520
He's taking this
fight seriously.

1404
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:22,200
Mentally and physically.

1405
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:24,160
He's ready for the
fight of his life!

1406
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,960
And he better be!

1407
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,880
And here comes the challenger!

1408
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,160
The challenger is greeted by

1409
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:34,280
a tremendous voice
from the crowd!

1410
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,600
Matilda!

1411
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,280
The challenger for the
Heavyweight crown

1412
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:39,000
is on his way into the ring!

1413
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,760
This is the most unusual

1414
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,360
Heavyweight Championship
fight in history!

1415
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,800
Man against beast!

1416
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,400
Who is going to win?

1417
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:57,400
But nevertheless, the fact is

1418
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,440
that the odds are six to
five on winning

1419
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,320
and three to one on a knockout.

1420
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,040
And that's what it's all about

1421
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,840
as we approach the
moment of truth.

1422
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,920
- Ladies and gentlemen!

1423
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:17,280
15 rounds of boxing

1424
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:21,800
for the Heavyweight
Championship of the World!

1425
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,520
In this corner,

1426
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:25,280
wearing a white belt,

1427
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,800
weighing at 195 pounds,

1428
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,120
from Sydney, Australia,

1429
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:37,160
the challenger, Matilda!

1430
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,560
- I love that animal.

1431
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,000
The perfect fighting machine.

1432
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,600
- And in the opposite corner,

1433
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,920
wearing green velvet trunks,

1434
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,360
weighing in at 201 pounds,

1435
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,720
from Coldwater, Mississippi!

1436
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:01,120
The Heavyweight
Champion of the World!

1437
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,040
Dockerty!

1438
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:08,880
The referee, George Latke.

1439
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,680
- Now let me take a look
at your gloves.

1440
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,560
Keep your punches up
at all times.

1441
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,040
Now I don't want any
kidney punches

1442
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,280
and I don't want any rapid
punches, is that clear?

1443
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,680
Now, does he
understand all this?

1444
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,200
- Oh, yes, yes.

1445
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:25,920
He's been train according to
the mark of the Queen's boxers.

1446
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,480
Just tap him on the shoulder,
he'll break.

1447
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,680
He's got ring manners.

1448
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:29,920
- He really does understand?

1449
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:30,600
- Yes, sir.

1450
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,640
- All right, okay.

1451
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:32,840
Shake hands now, come
out fighting.

1452
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,560
- Waiting now
for the greatest moment

1453
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,720
in Heavyweight
Championship history,

1454
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,080
Matilda the fighting,
boxing kangaroo.

1455
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:44,320
Lee Dockerty is the Heavyweight
Champion of the World.

1456
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,480
Here's Matilda, ready
to come out to battle.

1457
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:48,560
Our battle instructions
for the champion.

1458
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,960
Ready for the bell
for round one.

1459
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,200
There's the bell!

1460
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,920
Matilda bounds out there.

1461
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:59,440
The champion waits for him,
sticks out his left hand,

1462
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,120
it's short!

1463
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,440
Another one is short!

1464
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:04,280
Apparently, Matilda's a fine
boxer and a good hitter.

1465
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,600
The champion misses
over the head,

1466
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,240
takes a right to the
jaw and back.

1467
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:08,920
Both hands to the
body by Matilda.

1468
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,000
Matilda fakes the left hand.

1469
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,760
Drives another left,
it's wide over the mark.

1470
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,040
The champion is short.

1471
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,640
He's not landed a punch yet.

1472
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:17,840
The champion tries another
left hand and misses.

1473
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:18,960
And he ducks away.

1474
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,600
Misses a left hand
over the head,

1475
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,080
is driven back by a right
to the jaw by Matilda.

1476
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,760
The challenger is in
control of the fight

1477
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,840
here in round one.

1478
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:27,400
- Get off his feet!

1479
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,720
Break!

1480
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,840
- The referee, George
Latke, gets them apart.

1481
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,040
At long range again.

1482
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:34,200
Matilda bounds in, the
champion steps away,

1483
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,160
almost trips over
Matilda's feet.

1484
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:37,320
But he does not go down!

1485
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:39,600
A left in the head by
the champion,

1486
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:41,400
he takes a counter in right
in the left of the jaw,

1487
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:42,720
thrown by Matilda!

1488
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:45,640
The champion is
strong on the left.

1489
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:54,400
The champion may be out,
I don't know.

1490
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,280
The referee is counting numbers.

1491
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,520
He has two outs and he's
trying to get up now

1492
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,600
as the crowd reaches six,

1493
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:01,280
seven,

1494
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,120
eight.

1495
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,360
He is up at the count of eight

1496
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:04,640
and the referee wipes
off his gloves.

1497
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,320
- You can do it, come on, champ!

1498
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,800
- In real trouble!

1499
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,920
This is amazing tonight, folks!

1500
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,080
The challenger bounds in.

1501
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:12,520
Matilda comes at him.

1502
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,160
The champion is
stalling for time.

1503
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,680
He's combing around the ring.

1504
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,040
And he comes back with a left.

1505
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:20,320
- One.

1506
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:21,320
Two.

1507
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:22,120
Three.

1508
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,920
- And that's the bell!

1509
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,320
- God, that second punch!

1510
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,760
Dockerty doesn't even
know where he is.

1511
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,280
It might be over.

1512
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,600
- The bell has
saved the champion.

1513
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,000
A beaten champion gets
back to his corner.

1514
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,720
His helpers are worried
and working over it.

1515
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:39,760
- Keep it with you.

1516
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,520
Stay away from him,
even to box him!

1517
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,400
- You're doing fine.

1518
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,640
They're gonna keep it going.

1519
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:46,320
- Remember that!

1520
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,400
Box him!

1521
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,200
- The fighting kangaroo,
Matilda!

1522
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,400
They're a very happy
group in Matilda's corner.

1523
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,080
We're ready now.

1524
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,960
Dockerty comes out
for round two.

1525
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,840
The champion bicycles
a little bit.

1526
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:03,840
Moves away from the challenger.

1527
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,720
The challenger just
stands there.

1528
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,440
Watch the punch,
watch another one.

1529
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,760
Matilda blocks another left
hand, thrown by the champion.

1530
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,880
He still hasn't landed.

1531
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,880
Matilda in with a left
hand to the body.

1532
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,240
- Come on, champ!

1533
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,480
- He's wild with
his left hand!

1534
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,760
Matilda is a fine
defensive boxer.

1535
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,280
He drives a left and
right to the jaw.

1536
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,680
Again, the champion is
driven under the ropes.

1537
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:33,160
He bounds off and Matilda
throws him down to the canvas.

1538
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,400
And he referee has him get up,

1539
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,800
this time without a count.

1540
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:38,160
The champion trips over
Matilda's feet.

1541
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:39,720
Matilda on him again.

1542
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,680
A jab, a left and a
right to the jaw!

1543
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,560
And the champion is
driven out of the ring.

1544
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,080
He rose up off the ring!

1545
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,200
The champion out of the ring!

1546
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:48,320
They're very happy in
Matilda's corner.

1547
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,720
Matilda waiting for the
champ to get back in.

1548
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,600
The champion is trying
to get back in.

1549
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:54,080
He does beat the count.

1550
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,600
And there's the bell.

1551
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,640
The kangaroo back in his corner

1552
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,440
and there's the champion,
Lee Dockery.

1553
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:05,720
- You're doing great,
they love you.

1554
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,840
- Let me talk to him!

1555
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,160
All right, take it easy.

1556
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,120
- Well, Dockerty's
accomplished one thing.

1557
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:10,920
- What?

1558
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,000
- He made it to round three.

1559
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,320
No other opponent's
ever done that.

1560
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,320
- The first round
took so much out of him.

1561
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,880
The referee goes over
and asks him how he is.

1562
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,040
He is not in good shape
but he is game

1563
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,480
and he is going to
keep on fighting.

1564
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:25,200
And there's the bell
for round three!

1565
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,320
The kangaroo is across
the ring so fast!

1566
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,040
Dockerty isn't even out
of his corner!

1567
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,680
He's caught by a
right to the jaw!

1568
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,720
And the referee is
counting over him again.

1569
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,000
Dockerty on one knee is
taking the count.

1570
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,560
He's back on his feet and
ready to fight.

1571
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,600
And Matilda comes at him.

1572
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,480
Dockerty misses a
left and a right.

1573
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,920
He's trying hard but he's
not landing any punches.

1574
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:44,760
He takes another
right to the jaw.

1575
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,640
He almost goes out of
the ring but he does not.

1576
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:49,840
The ropes hold him up.

1577
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:52,320
He grabs hold of Matilda
to keep from going down.

1578
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:54,360
Dockerty is wobbly in there.

1579
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,400
He's on very rubbery feet.

1580
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,720
He moves to the left and
Matilda comes up behind him

1581
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,080
and drives the right
hand to the head!

1582
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,200
Matilda moves away from
Dockerty again.

1583
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,400
Dockerty is reeling
around the ring.

1584
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,680
He is in bad shape!

1585
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,280
If he were not a
Heavyweight Champion,

1586
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,040
it probably would stop him!

1587
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:12,320
Matilda is on him again,
reigning punches to the body!

1588
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,440
And then to the head.

1589
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,840
This kangaroo can fight!

1590
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,720
He messes him up good.

1591
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:16,800
A good jab!

1592
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,080
Two more, three more
jabs to the chest!

1593
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,280
Wobbly Dockerty fires
a meaningless left hand

1594
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,920
and he goes down again.

1595
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,080
But he bounds up quickly

1596
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:27,240
and the referee goes
around them.

1597
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,200
- What is keeping him up?

1598
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,280
- Dockerty misses a left.

1599
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:31,040
Counter to the left,
right to the head.

1600
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,040
A left hand to the
body by Matilda!

1601
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:35,520
Dockerty is taking an
awful beating in there!

1602
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:36,920
He still has not landed a punch

1603
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,600
and we're near the end
of round three!

1604
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,120
Dockerty is battered, puts
both hands to the body

1605
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:45,520
and none to the head as
Matilda give him no rest.

1606
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,360
The champion is taking a
terrible beating.

1607
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:48,520
A left hook to the jaw!

1608
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,080
Dockerty is down again!

1609
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,600
I don't know if he's
going to make it.

1610
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,440
Matilda bounds across him!

1611
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,880
The referee is counting
over the champion.

1612
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,760
- Four!

1613
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:01,320
Five!

1614
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,800
Six!

1615
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,080
- Seven.

1616
01:19:04,120 --> 01:19:06,200
He's trying to get up, eight!

1617
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,040
Nine.

1618
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:10,080
And the bell saves him again.

1619
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,320
Dockerty's back in his corner.

1620
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,240
He has taken some
beating tonight.

1621
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,600
There's the doctor!

1622
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:16,640
- It's all over.

1623
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,320
He can't come out
from the fourth.

1624
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,000
I'm almost sorry.

1625
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,560
- Dockerty
won't let them!

1626
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:23,840
He wants to go on!

1627
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,400
He has fought courageously!

1628
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:26,480
He still wants to fight.

1629
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,160
- How are you, champ?

1630
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,640
- Lee Dockerty,

1631
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:33,320
and believe it or not, something
definite has happened here.

1632
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,400
I don't believe it.

1633
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,880
The crowd started
rooting for Matilda

1634
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,200
at the start of the fight.

1635
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:38,720
They have now changed.

1636
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,960
- There's the bell for
round four of the most amazing

1637
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,400
Heavyweight Championship
fight in all history!

1638
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,480
And the crowd is now for the
champion, believe it or not.

1639
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:52,360
But he is still taking
punishment in there.

1640
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,800
Punches all over to the body,
to the head.

1641
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,120
Matilda bangs and
staggers him again.

1642
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,080
I don't even know what's
hold the champion up.

1643
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,680
He is reeling around the ring.

1644
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:01,920
I don't think he
knows where he is.

1645
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:05,000
The crowd is now with him
because of game.

1646
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,760
He is a gallant
fighter in there.

1647
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,240
He just will not quit.

1648
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,360
He is a true champion,
win or lose, tonight!

1649
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,120
But he takes two, three,
four more jabs to the chin

1650
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,240
and still he has not
landed a punch.

1651
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,440
A pounding right to the
jaw by Matilda.

1652
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,840
He is staggered back
into the ropes.

1653
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:21,080
The champion is wobbly in there.

1654
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,200
His legs are rubbery!

1655
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,000
Matilda can't figure him out.

1656
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,800
The champion goes in
and holds on.

1657
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,760
Dockerty is still holding on.

1658
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,080
The challenger is lifted!

1659
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:34,560
- Matilda's been hit!

1660
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,760
- And the
challenger is hurt!

1661
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:38,040
That's the first time
he's been hit tonight.

1662
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,480
The tide is turned.

1663
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,080
The challenger is hurt!

1664
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:44,960
Matilda stands there.

1665
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,480
The champion stands there.

1666
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,440
Nobody seems to know
what is happening.

1667
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,200
This is amazing!

1668
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,160
- The referee waves
the champion in.

1669
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:53,800
He's moving in on Matilda.

1670
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,520
But wait!

1671
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,160
The challenger throws
in the towel!

1672
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,720
The fight is over.

1673
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,360
Lee Dockerty is still
the heavyweight champion!

1674
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,040
- I don't believe it.

1675
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,160
- Bernie!

1676
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:12,040
Bernie!

1677
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,200
I love you!

1678
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,400
- I don't understand it,
Duke.

1679
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,640
First they cheering their
heads off for Matilda

1680
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,200
and then they want him to lose.

1681
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,040
- Well, sure, they
loved Matilda up to a point.

1682
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,960
Then they saw themselves in
that ring, the human race.

1683
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,480
Suddenly they felt threatened.

1684
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,480
Man doesn't just survive, Al,

1685
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,200
he's got to prevail.

1686
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,280
- It was like a dream, it was,

1687
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:30,720
with everyone having a
happy ending, so to speak

1688
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,360
Bernie is now Dockerty's manger

1689
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,200
and you won't believe this.

1690
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,840
The Pinky is his assistant.

1691
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,760
Bernie married Kathleen
and he's very successful.

1692
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,800
Bought her a beautiful house

1693
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:52,120
and four gorgeous kids.

1694
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:00,040
Mr. Parkhurst, he got every
award they could give him

1695
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,360
and he's now managing
editor of a newspaper.

1696
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,960
Tanya is singing
regularly in Las Vegas now

1697
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,440
when she's not see Dockerty.

1698
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,760
Oh, Gordon,

1699
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,920
he's the vice president with
the William Morris Agency

1700
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,400
in Los Angeles.

1701
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:35,000
Matilda's living with
Uncle Nono and his family.

1702
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,480
Uncle Nono retired and
bought a small country

1703
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:41,920
in Central America where
he's now raising kangaroos.

1704
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,760
And I know they're very,
very happy.

1705
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,680
They were the nicest
people in the world.

1706
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,440
That's exactly the
way it happened.

1707
01:23:58,360 --> 01:23:59,200
It's the truth.

1708
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,160
I've got to go and do something.

1709
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,320
Don't go away.

1710
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:09,160
I'll be back in a minute.

1711
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:10,680
Come along, Junior.

1712
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:11,560
Up you go.

1713
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:21,280
Uncle Bernie will be
along in a minute.

1714
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,640
- I wanna hold Junior!

1715
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,680
- No, I wanna hold him!

1716
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:41,880
- I wanna touch him!

1717
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:44,160
- He's had his milk and
his candy bar.

1718
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:46,600
Children,

1719
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:49,680
today's a very, very special
treat because I love you all,

1720
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,800
today you can give him
his candy bar.

1721
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,800
- Good, we'll have him
back in a couple of hours.

1722
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,520
After we drop off this kids.

1723
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:57,640
- We going to have lunch?

1724
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,320
- Well, if I get out of
the gym in time.

1725
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:02,040
- Are you taking
Junior to the gym again?

1726
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,520
- Okay, everybody into the car.

1727
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,680
- Honey!

1728
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:06,120
- Go on, will you?

1729
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:09,480
- Bernie,
it's inhuman to do that

1730
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:10,760
to a baby kangaroo!

1731
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,720
It's inhuman!

1732
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:15,480
- Did anybody ever tell you

1733
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:17,520
that you're always
repeating yourself?

1734
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:20,080
This is not just any kangaroo.

1735
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,560
Junior's different.

1736
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,240
Remember who his father was.

1737
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:25,400
Bye, Billy!

1738
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,240
Bye!

1739
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,080
- Bye!

1740
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,720
- Bye, Billy, we love you!

1741
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:29,840
- Bye, Billy!

1742
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,160
We love you, Billy!

1743
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,200
- Life's grand.

1744
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,520
