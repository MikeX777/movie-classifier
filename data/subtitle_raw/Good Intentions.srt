27
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,565
I don't know.
Buck forty?

28
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:49,526
Lemme see your stomach.
Cut that out.

29
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,528

Nothing.

36
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,894
You sure about that?

37
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:27,022
'Cause the circus is in town,
and Momma's on edge.

38
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,691

Come on!

131
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,714

00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,969
Hey. Kyle doesn't say much
anymore.

134
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,305
Oh, honey,
that's cause he's a man.

135
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,515
Well, in the beginning,
he talked all the time.

136
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,060
Now he just comes home from work
and turns on the TV.

137
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,605
I mean, he's still a sweetie,
he's just quiet.

138
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,899
Well,
does he still wanna--

139
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,733
You know.

140
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,985
Yeah, all the time.

141
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,155
I think you need to close down
the fun factory for awhile.

142
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,032
Let him know
admission ain't free.

143
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,412
Pam. Pam!

144
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,831
He has got to learn
to think outside your box.

145
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,500
Ah!
Oh, Shane,

146
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,501

147
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,794
you're gonna
break his leg.

148
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,128
Shane! Chris!

149
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,880
Come help your Uncle Kyle
fix his race car.

151
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,593
Come here,
you little weirdo.

152
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,553

to change a set of tires

153
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,180

15 seconds, man?

154
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,348
Give it.
All right.

155
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,808
Hey, now.
Shane? Shane.

156
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,643
Get your brother and
get back over here and wrestle.

157
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,313
Come on!
Just don't break his leg.

158
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,523
Let's go!

159
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,527
That's my pit crew!

160
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,781
Hey, Ches?
Hmm?

161
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,201
How come a woman can love a man,
and that sometimes ain't enough?

162
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,244
What?

163
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,079
I mean, take Pam.

164
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,332
Kyle goes to
the Shangri-La.

165
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,793
This again?
But she loves him.

166
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,795
Well, he loves her too.
You know?

167
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,214
It's just,
with the words and all that,

168
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,215
it's kinda hard
for some guys.

169
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,424
They just can't say it.

170
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,343
Well, then, so why does he
go to a titty bar?

171
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,720
You really wanna know?
Yes.

172
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,098
All right.
Then I am gonna tell you.

173
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,561
You like sunsets,
right?

174
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,563
I mean, I know you do,
because I seen you look at 'em,

175
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,939
and sometimes
they even make you cry.

176
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,899
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.

177
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,987
Do you remember
those mountains in, uh,

178
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,072
Yellowstone,
on our honeymoon?

179
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,908
Yeah,
they were amazing.

180
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,703
Now, you know, the fellow that
discovered them, he was French,

181
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,289
and he named them
the Grand Tetons.

182
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,999
Do you know why?
Why?

183
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,250
Because he thought
they was about

184
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,210
the most beautiful things
he ever seen.

185
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,006
Do you know what
"teton" means in French?

186
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,966
It means "tit."

187
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,759
Oh!
What?

188
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,095
They are not gonna name a
mountain range The Grand Tits.

189
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,430
Well, you look it up.

190
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,432
I will.
All right.

191
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,808
That's just how it is.

192
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,060
See, with us fellas,
we look at them titty bars,

193
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,438
and we see nothing
but beautiful sunsets.

194
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,398
Mm-hm.

195
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,525
I ever catch you
staring at a pair of sunsets,

196
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,194
and it is gonna be the longest
damn eclipse you ever seen.

197
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,531
(Giggling)

198
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,965
Ches, you asleep?
No.

199
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,177
Ches.

200
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,596
I don't wanna hear any more
future pit crew talk

201
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,139
with Kyle and the boys, okay?

202
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,891
Oh, we's just messing around.

203
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,726
The boys love race cars.

204
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,145
Plus, I am the new sponsor.

205
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,563
What?

206
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,149
Well, just so
he can get a carburetor.

207
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,609
Can't you see it, though?

208
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,361
"Chester's Inventions
and Liquor,"

209
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,904
right there
on the hood of his car

210
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,364
as it's coming across
the finish line.

211
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,949
Chessy, he ain't never even
finished a damn race.

212
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,117
Are you out of your mind?

213
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,036
No. I'm not.

214
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,914
He's your future brother-in-law,
and I believe in him.

215
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,124
Well, that makes
one of you.

216
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,379
What's wrong with
being a mechanic, anyway?

217
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:14,340
Kyle's a mechanic.

218
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,300
My dad was a mechanic.

219
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,094
Mechanics don't go
to college.

220
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,679
Your daddy did not go
to college.

221
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,474
What's so important
about college?

222
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,184
My daddy was a good man.

223
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,603
Yes, Ches,
your daddy was a good man.

224
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,562
But he was poor.

225
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,065
And we're barely
scraping by.

226
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,525
We're robbing Peter
to pay Paul,

227
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,859
and I don't want the boys
to have to struggle

228
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,237
for every single
solitary dime.

229
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,822
One of my inventions
is bound to hit.

230
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,074
Oh, Ches! No.
The boys--

231
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,909
The only way that
they're gonna have a better life

232
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,160
is if they get
a good education.

233
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,663
Not chasing
some half-cocked pipedream.

234
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,540
Half-cocked?
Half-cocked?

235
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,959
When have you ever known me
to go off half-cocked?

236
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,799

What was that?

00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,822
BOTH:
Nothing!

241
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,993
I Can't find 'em!

242
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,202
Keep looking.

243
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,913
Got 'em!

244
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,334
(Clattering)

245
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,556
Can I try it?

246
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,557
You're too young.

247
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,684
I didn't even touch these
till I was eight.

Well, I told him
to send that here.

255

$336?
Are you nuts?

256
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,254
Etta, in a week we will have
tripled that money.

Are the boys okay?

262
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,328
No thanks
to your stupid fireworks.

263
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,580
Ches,
they could've been killed.

264
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,332
Well, at least
we're covered for fire.

265
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,084
Not for this one,
you're not.

266
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,586
Manufacturing fireworks in the
state of Georgia is illegal.

267
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,129
I should arrest you,
Chester.

268
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,007
Consider it a personal favour
that I'm not.

Oh, you put
green in it this time.

270

It's nice, Chester.

I'm looking for more of a--
You know, a deterrent.

Shooting's a deterrent.

there is.

what to buy.

318

Boy, I tell you, these two
look awfully similar to me.

319

Now why's this one
so much more?

320
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:59,327
Uh, it's primarily
the condition.

321
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:01,496
I mean, truthfully,
I've been moving more and more

322
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:04,207
to selling
these kind of pieces online.

Here.

330
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,435
You know, a thousand dollars
is still an awful lot to spend.

331
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,188
Think you might take
$700 for it?

332
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,482
For you?
I could do $800.

333
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:32,194
You are the generous one.

334
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,031
I've seen them do this
on the Road Show.

335
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,161
You ever handle
a firearm before?

336
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,955
Can't say that I have.

337
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,208
Meet me out by the pond.

338
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,209
Go on.

339
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,464
Now, this thing
ever been restored?

340
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,174
Oh, no, ma'am.

341
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,384
Yeah, 'cause restoration
hurts the--

342
00:18:56,384 --> 00:18:58,303
The value of the piece.

343
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,222
Then again,
you knew that, duh.

344
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:03,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

345
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,020
When's the last time you saw a
deer hold up a liquor store, hm?

346
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,813
Not too often.
All right.

347
00:19:08,813 --> 00:19:10,857
Aim at the fat guy,
all right?

348
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:12,233
Aim at
the middle of his body,

349
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:14,778
that way you got
plenty of margin for error.

350
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,488
Go ahead.

351
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,490
It's just that
this a really big investment.

352
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,574
Really big.

353
00:19:19,574 --> 00:19:20,784
Well,
if it's an investment,

354
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,369
you really should
take into account

355
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,497
the superior condition
of this piece over here.

356
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:29,084
Oh, no!

357
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,169
No, I'm going with this one,
for $800.

358
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,879
$800, it is.

359
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:35,590
Yeah, but let's not tell
Chester about this.

360
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,425
Oh, it's a surprise.

361
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:39,552
Yeah, it would be.

362
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:40,345
(Gunshot)

363
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,060
Shit, Ches.
You shot me.

364
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,437
Nobody shoots
the "Bo" target.

365
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:53,566
Gimme the gun.

366
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,320
I am afraid,

367
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,031
in all good conscience,

368
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:02,033
I cannot sell you
a firearm.

369
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:04,619
Huh?

370
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:05,995
What?

371
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,095
Hey, honey,
what is that?

372
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,930
Oh, that's an antique
rosewood table.

373
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,140
Ain't it something?

374
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,350
Yeah.
Where'd it come from?

375
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,518
Uncle Jeffrey.

376
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,103
Hm.
Present?

377
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,980
Naw.
He died.

378
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,690
Which one was Jeffrey?

379
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,817
You met him last summer.

380
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,652
I don't believe I did.

381
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:39,487
Yeah, you did.
Yeah, he really liked you.

382
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,656
Well, you don't seem
too broke up about it.

383
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:44,868
Oh, well, you know, uh,
he'd been sick for a long time.

384
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,870
It's more a relief
than anything else.

385
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,581
Cancer?

386
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,207
What?
Jeffrey.

387
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:53,960
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

388
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,722
Stopped by Bo's today.

389
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,849
Oh, Ches, no!

390
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:09,893
Well,
I wanted to buy a shotgun.

391
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,269
He wouldn't
sell it to me.

392
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:12,437
Well, good.

393
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,397
We got two boys that need their
father a hell of a lot more

394
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:17,192
than we need that 800 bucks
that fella took.

395
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:22,614
Who said anything
about 800 bucks?

396
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,740
I said $200

397
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,074
'cause I didn't want you
worrying about it.

398
00:21:25,074 --> 00:21:27,035
Ches!
You said $800.

399
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,036
Now, eat.

400
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,288
(Knocking on door)

401
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:31,664
I'll get it.

402
00:21:40,548 --> 00:21:42,800
Etta Milford?

403
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,219
You're under arrest.

404
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:48,681
(Chuckling)

405
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:50,016
I love doing that.

406
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,021
Is Ches home?

407
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:56,314
CHESTER:
In here, Ernie.

408
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:58,983
Say, you don't happen to have
any of those, um,

409
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:00,985
chocolate brownies
that you had at little league?

410
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,279
Oh, plum out, Ernie.

411
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:05,239
CHESTER:
There's a fresh batch
in the pantry.

412
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,331
Withholding evidence?

413
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:15,500
Can't get nothin'
past you, Ernie.

414
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:30,682
What's that?

415
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,475
My first million.

416
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:34,560
It's like
a Swiss army knife.

417
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,188
Yeah, but did you ever see
a Swiss army knife

418
00:22:37,188 --> 00:22:39,482
with a cigarette lighter?

419
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:40,858
Yeah.

420
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:41,985
Really?

421
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,194
All the time.

422
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:50,827
Hey, baby.
Hey, beautiful.

423
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,995
Come here.

424
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:55,039
Hey, can I get you something
for dessert?

425
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,624
Depends what you got.

426
00:22:56,624 --> 00:23:00,420
Well,
warm apple pie.

427
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,131
Chocolate cake.

428
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,218
Fruit cup.

429
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:11,180
The cobbler's
even better.

430
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,101
Yeah, I think I'm gonna have to
try that cobbler.

431
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:17,353
You know, you must make
a killing in tips.

432
00:23:17,353 --> 00:23:20,273
Oh, shut up, Ches.

433
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,399
The usual?

434
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,068
No, I'll have the,
uh, fruit cup.

435
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:26,404
I'll get right on that.

436
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,322
Thank you, baby.

437
00:23:28,322 --> 00:23:30,742
Who's minding the store?

438
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,577
Oh, I'm trying
something new.

439
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:41,836
¶

440
00:23:41,836 --> 00:23:44,505
Why they spend so much money
on this thing?

441
00:23:44,505 --> 00:23:46,674
Don't nobody go faster
than 20 miles an hour

442
00:23:46,674 --> 00:23:48,801
in this godforsaken town.

443
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:51,554
Why you always so fired up
about giving out tickets?

444
00:23:51,554 --> 00:23:55,433
Town like this, chances are
it's somebody you know.

445
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:59,020
Just means one more person
thinks you're a dick.

446
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,440
People think I'm a dick?

447
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,441
Oh, hell, I don't know.

448
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,817
Everybody thinks
somebody's a dick.

449
00:24:04,817 --> 00:24:06,360
But when
you're new in town,

450
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,322
it doesn't make sense to get off
on the wrong foot with folks.

451
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:10,948
Leave 'em be.

452
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:15,661
But we're cops.

453
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:18,623
I think you focus on that
way too much.

454
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:22,376
(Vehicle approaching)

455
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:24,045
Oh!
We got one.

456
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,632
Yeah! Twenty-two.

457
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,176
It's a new record.

458
00:24:30,176 --> 00:24:31,510
Light 'em up.

459
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:41,979
¶

460
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,081
Brought your favourite,
so dig on in.

461
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,540
You wrecked the car.

462
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,376
No.

463
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,419
No use wasting five bucks
at the diner

464
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:08,589
when your lovely wife can make
you the same BBQ for a dollar.

465
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,676
Let me ask you something.

466
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:14,011
Pennies. They ever scream
when you pinch 'em?

467
00:25:14,011 --> 00:25:16,347
Every little bit helps.
Now, eat.

468
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:22,186
Oh, hey. What did, uh--?
What did Ernie say?

469
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:24,397
He's suspicious of that fella
opened the thrift shop.

470
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,732
Oh, the antique shop?

471
00:25:26,732 --> 00:25:28,776
Ever since he moved here.
Bam!

472
00:25:28,776 --> 00:25:31,487
I get robbed just like that?

473
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:32,905
Got a way
to get that money back.

474
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,040
Atlanta Braves All-Stars
Pecan Cracking Machine.

475
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,877
Famous Braves players,
regional pride, state tie in.

476
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:47,962
You follow me?

477
00:25:47,962 --> 00:25:49,922
Which players?

478
00:25:49,922 --> 00:25:51,340
I don't know yet.

479
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,092
Doesn't even have
a Brave uniform on.

480
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:55,052
Yeah, well, this is
just a work in progress.

481
00:25:55,052 --> 00:25:57,179
Um-- Voila!

482
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:58,514
The pecan.

483
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:00,057
Number 1
pecan-producing state?

484
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:01,642
Georgia.

485
00:26:01,642 --> 00:26:03,352
Oh, you're kidding.

486
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:04,979
No, no. This is good.

487
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:07,440
See?

488
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,816
(Laughing)
Of course, now,

489
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:10,276
it's supposed to
break the shell,

490
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:12,695
but this is just
a prototype.

491
00:26:12,695 --> 00:26:13,487
You made this?

492
00:26:13,487 --> 00:26:14,989
Uh-huh.

493
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:16,741
And I got a fellow
up in Atlanta

494
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,744
says he'll make me a whole bunch
of 'em once I get it right.

495
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,786
Uh-huh.

496
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:23,789
How much is that
gonna cost us?

497
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:26,250
Oh, just 11 bucks each.

498
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,752
If I could get a hundred...

499
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,503
Eleven hundred dollars?

500
00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:31,505
You paid him?
No. I didn't.

501
00:26:31,505 --> 00:26:32,590
I mean,
I don't have the money yet.

502
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,675
It's not Labour Day.
Oh, Chester!

503
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:37,553
You are not planning on
wasting our money on this thing!

504
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:40,681
Wasting?

505
00:26:40,681 --> 00:26:42,308
This is who I am.

506
00:26:42,308 --> 00:26:44,727
I mean, you know that.
Not-- Not this.

507
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:46,812
The liquor store
isn't me.

508
00:26:46,812 --> 00:26:48,856
You know that.
You've always known that.

509
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:51,442
No.
No, this is the one.

510
00:26:51,442 --> 00:26:53,027
I can feel it.

511
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,050
Hey, come here.

512
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,134
What does that say?

513
00:27:17,134 --> 00:27:18,135
Bread.

514
00:27:18,135 --> 00:27:19,678
Go get your mama some.

515
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:22,431
MAN:
Hello.

516
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:26,143
That table I sold you.
How's it workin' out?

517
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:29,396
Uh.
You did not hear that.

518
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:35,819
It is in my front hallway,

519
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:38,906
growing older and more valuable
every day.

520
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:41,450
Well, I have some new pieces
that just came in,

521
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,536
if you'd like to stop by.

522
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,416
I'm kinda tapped out
after that table.

523
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:51,585
Well,
I'm about out of space.

524
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:52,795
I may sell the whole lot

525
00:27:52,795 --> 00:27:55,506
to an associate in Savannah
at a discount.

526
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:57,258
Good to see you.

527
00:27:57,258 --> 00:28:07,518
¶

528
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:20,948
Why's he looking at you
like that?

529
00:28:20,948 --> 00:28:23,492
Son, your mother's
an awful handsome woman.

530
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:25,953
That's his way
of paying a compliment.

531
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:27,204
You can do
that sort of thing

532
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:29,081
when you charge less
than other markets.

533
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:31,208
Course if you didn't?

534
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:32,960
Might be considered
inappropriate.

535
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,503
Ain't that right,
Mr. Simmons?

536
00:28:34,503 --> 00:28:36,505
Awful handsome.

537
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:46,557
I wanna be him
when I grow up.

538
00:28:46,557 --> 00:28:47,975
Chef or an elf?

539
00:28:47,975 --> 00:28:49,309
I'm gonna be a fireman.

540
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:51,812
Oh, yeah?

541
00:28:51,812 --> 00:28:54,189
Well, how about
a fire chief?

542
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:57,776
You know, you go to school
and get a good education,

543
00:28:57,776 --> 00:29:00,195
you can be
anything you want.

544
00:29:00,195 --> 00:29:03,657
Have stuff and do stuff
that Daddy and I never did.

545
00:29:03,657 --> 00:29:04,950
(Music playing on TV)

546
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,328
Hey, y'all go in the living room
and watch TV.

547
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:10,330
So you found this
at a flea market?

548
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,623
Years ago, yes.

549
00:29:11,665 --> 00:29:13,208
Do you remember
what you paid for it?

550
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:15,085
Five dollars, maybe.

551
00:29:15,085 --> 00:29:17,004
What do you think
it's worth today?

552
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:18,589
I have no idea.

553
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:22,843
I think in the neighbourhood of
one thousand dollars.

554
00:29:22,843 --> 00:29:23,927
<i>Wow.</i>

555
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:26,346
Damn that's
a nice neighbourhood.

556
00:29:26,346 --> 00:29:28,015
Why can't you do that?

557
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,145
Boy, this is
a beautiful piece.

558
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:34,438
You can say that again.

559
00:29:34,438 --> 00:29:35,939
What?

560
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:38,358
Huh?
Huh?

561
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:41,445
You sure I can't interest you
in this Windsor back?

562
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:42,905
It's 19th century.

563
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:43,864
There you go again,

564
00:29:43,864 --> 00:29:45,949
pushing
all the expensive pieces.

565
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:47,868
It is all I can do
to afford this one.

566
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:49,536
I'll take it.

567
00:29:49,536 --> 00:29:51,413
Okay, you can have it.

568
00:29:51,413 --> 00:29:52,998
Now, can you hold it?

569
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:55,626
'Cause I gotta go, uh,
round up some cash.

570
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:02,883
You know,
I can tell the future.

571
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:04,635
You predict the future.

572
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:07,095
Oh, I can, I got ways.
Let me tell ya.

573
00:30:07,095 --> 00:30:10,015
In fact, I know where you're
gonna be in an hour from now.

574
00:30:10,015 --> 00:30:11,767
Where's that?

575
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:15,270
I think you're gonna be
in the back of my cruiser,

576
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,022
wearing handcuffs.

577
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:20,359
You're so bad!

578
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,944
Aw, you don't even know
the half of it.

579
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:23,362
(Door opening)

580
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,618
Always know where I can
find you, Ernie.

581
00:30:31,495 --> 00:30:34,331
I would like a pint
of chocolate chip, please.

582
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:41,046
Just you out today?

583
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:44,883
No, I got Buck and Rob staking
out Chester's place as we speak.

584
00:30:44,925 --> 00:30:47,594
I'm just saying,
I think we'd have more crime

585
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:49,346
if we had more laws.

586
00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:51,932
You know what I mean?

587
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:53,183
Hm.

588
00:30:54,017 --> 00:30:56,728
So, Ernie,
how's your wife, Angela?

589
00:30:56,728 --> 00:30:58,105
(Coughing)

590
00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:01,984
She's fine,
thank you for asking.

591
00:31:01,984 --> 00:31:03,819
All right.

592
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:06,071
I guess
I'll see y'all later.

593
00:31:07,072 --> 00:31:09,032
You have a nice day,
ma'am.

594
00:31:09,032 --> 00:31:10,576
You take care now.

595
00:31:13,328 --> 00:31:23,755
¶

596
00:31:23,755 --> 00:31:26,466
Hi, guys.

597
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:27,634
Who's hungry?

598
00:31:27,634 --> 00:31:29,886
There we go.

599
00:31:29,886 --> 00:31:32,514
Back up.
Come on, now.

600
00:31:32,514 --> 00:31:34,182
Momma needs a new chair.

601
00:31:34,182 --> 00:31:35,976
There's enough for everyone.

602
00:31:38,437 --> 00:31:41,898
¶ Time to take matters
in my own hands, yeah ¶

603
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:45,193
¶ It's time for me to take it
like a man ¶

604
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:47,696

605
00:31:47,696 --> 00:31:48,697
(Radio crackling)

606
00:31:48,697 --> 00:31:49,698
<i>MAN:

607
00:31:49,698 --> 00:31:50,907

609

387?

610
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:55,912
Goats in the road.

611

(Pig squealing)

613
00:32:07,215 --> 00:32:09,843
Would you put that thing down
and get over here and help me?

614
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:14,931
Oh, my God, we got ourselves
a damn stampede!

615
00:32:14,931 --> 00:32:16,141

617
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,571
Ah, really?

618
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:31,323
You know that
there's another liquor store

619
00:32:31,364 --> 00:32:32,741

right?

620
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:35,952

623
00:32:42,209 --> 00:32:43,335
Is that new?

624
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:47,923
Yeah.

625
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:51,593
Hundred and ten, 15...

626
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:56,264
You know, if you're gonna
make a habit out of doing this,

627
00:32:56,264 --> 00:32:57,808
would you mind
buying some rope?

628
00:32:57,808 --> 00:32:59,643
That stings coming off.

629
00:33:04,064 --> 00:33:05,565

There's a train coming now.

633
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:11,321

Well, I still get
that case of beer, don't I?

639
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:25,502
Well, I don't want none of
that crap stuff, neither.

640
00:33:25,502 --> 00:33:27,337
I want Bud this time.

643
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,800
All right, see that?

644
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,844
That woman there
invented a pair of pantyhose

645
00:33:33,844 --> 00:33:36,805
that make that poor woman's ass
look like a peach!

646
00:33:38,723 --> 00:33:41,810
God.
Geez, that looks good to me.

00:33:42,936 --> 00:33:45,105
All right. Okay.

648
00:33:47,357 --> 00:33:49,568
Now, what did
the perpetrator look like?

649
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,777
What did he look like?

650
00:33:50,777 --> 00:33:52,237
Stocky,
mask and a shot gun.

651
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,406
You seen anybody walkin' around
matches that description?

652
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,075
Hey, Sonny.

653
00:33:57,117 --> 00:33:59,619
I didn't rob you.
Don't get pissy with me.

654
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:00,662
Oh, Ernie,
it's the second time.

655
00:34:00,662 --> 00:34:02,122
What the hell else
you gotta--

656
00:34:02,122 --> 00:34:03,582
I just came from
a dicey situation up the road

657
00:34:03,623 --> 00:34:05,041
to come down here
and assist you.

658
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:07,794
What happened? A squirrel
get run over by a car up there?

659
00:34:07,794 --> 00:34:10,088
I think you forget
who you're talking to.

660
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:12,465
Oh, no, I know exactly
who I'm talking to.

661
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:13,883
I can tell by
the chocolate sauce

662
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:15,260
on your lip there,
Sheriff.

663
00:34:21,516 --> 00:34:23,727
Well, anyway.

664
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:25,145
We're--

665
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:28,607
We're gonna get
this son of a bitch.

666
00:34:28,607 --> 00:34:31,192
I gotta go get some Bud.

667
00:34:31,234 --> 00:34:32,986
You don't drink Bud.

668
00:34:32,986 --> 00:34:36,114
Well, I figure now's
as good a time as any to start.

669
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:38,575
Is that going on the tab?
Or are you gonna pay for it?

670
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:42,454
Any other strange things,
you know, you just call me.

671
00:34:42,454 --> 00:34:48,585
¶

672
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:51,838
I had the strangest conversation
with Kyle last night.

673
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:54,466
ETTA:
'Cause you shut down
the fun factory, didn't ya?

674
00:34:56,509 --> 00:34:57,635
Yeah, Chester told him

675
00:34:57,677 --> 00:35:01,014
you'd been inheriting
some furniture recently.

676
00:35:01,014 --> 00:35:02,807
He did?

677
00:35:04,517 --> 00:35:08,605
Yeah. Apparently your relatives
are dropping like flies.

678
00:35:08,605 --> 00:35:10,815
Which makes them
my relatives.

679
00:35:10,815 --> 00:35:13,151
And I never even
heard of them.

680
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:15,236
I have had that chair
in the basement forever.

681
00:35:15,278 --> 00:35:16,905
Yeah, uh-huh.

682
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:18,448
What about that table?

683
00:35:18,448 --> 00:35:21,242
My, somebody has taken their
curious pills this morning.

684
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:24,204
Etta! I saw that chair
in Zachary's shop last week.

685
00:35:24,204 --> 00:35:25,330
I'm sure it is
a very common design.

686
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,831
No, no, no.
This one.

687
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:27,916
I was carrying take-out

688
00:35:27,916 --> 00:35:29,501
when I knocked it over
and chipped it.

689
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:32,003
Price tag read $1500.

690
00:35:32,003 --> 00:35:33,004
I about had
a heart attack.

691
00:35:33,004 --> 00:35:34,339
Figured he'd make me
pay for it.

692
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:35,632
He didn't?

693
00:35:35,632 --> 00:35:37,383
I knew it. I knew it.
I knew it!

694
00:35:37,383 --> 00:35:38,551
Where did you get
that kind of money?

695
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:40,470
I sort of took out a loan.

696
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,097
From who?

697
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:43,181
The store.

698
00:35:44,724 --> 00:35:46,059
Chester
wouldn't do that.

699
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:52,232
Oh, my God.

700
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:54,943
Oh, my God.
Oh, my--

701
00:35:54,943 --> 00:35:56,069
Oh, hey! No.
Not there.

702
00:35:56,069 --> 00:35:57,153
Up!
Come on! Come on!

703
00:35:57,153 --> 00:35:58,363
Jesus, Etta!

704
00:35:58,363 --> 00:36:01,407
You have been robbing
your own husband?

705
00:36:01,407 --> 00:36:04,369
You are gonna fall through this
floor straight down to hell.

706
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:07,330
No, I am investing
in their future!

707
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,082
With a chair and a table?
So far.

708
00:36:09,082 --> 00:36:12,460
So far? You cannot be thinking
about doing this again!

709
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,670
I don't know!

710
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,380
I haven't
thought it through yet.

711
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,173
Okay?
Yeah. Obviously.

712
00:36:19,676 --> 00:36:22,053
This last time
really shook Chester up.

713
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:26,015
(Honking)

714
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:29,060
Oh, Lord, what now?

715
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,145
(Barking)
Daddy's got a dog!

716
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:39,529
What the hell are you doing
with a wolf in the car?

717
00:36:39,529 --> 00:36:40,780
(Barking)
Oh, that is not a wolf.

718
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,323
It's a guard dog, baby.

719
00:36:42,323 --> 00:36:43,658
Come here
and take a look.

720
00:36:43,658 --> 00:36:45,326
ETTA:
We saw something just like that
in Yellowstone

721
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:46,703
and you called it a wolf.

722
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:48,371
Wolves are related
to dogs.

723
00:36:48,371 --> 00:36:51,207
Some dogs look
a little bit like a wolf.

724
00:36:51,207 --> 00:36:53,126
That's what this one does.
(Barking)

725
00:36:53,126 --> 00:36:54,919
That thing looks
exactly like a wolf.

726
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,337
(Growling)

727
00:36:56,337 --> 00:36:59,716
Chris, Shane,
step away from there!

728
00:36:59,716 --> 00:37:01,426
Next time when Chester's
robber buddy shows up

729
00:37:01,426 --> 00:37:03,469
he's gonna be in for
a big effin' surprise.

730
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:07,098
(Barking)

731
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,225
You're bringing that thing
to the store?

732
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:10,727
Yeah.

733
00:37:10,727 --> 00:37:13,021
So, what? It can eat the robber
before he eats you?

734
00:37:13,021 --> 00:37:14,480
The fella
that sold him to me

735
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,733
gave me the pamphlet
with his commands.

736
00:37:18,526 --> 00:37:19,777
Sure would like to see it.

737
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:23,906
It's in the car.

738
00:37:23,906 --> 00:37:25,617
That's my bad.

739
00:37:30,663 --> 00:37:31,706
Might want to leave
a note.

740
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:34,334
Hey, Uncle Kyle!

741
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:36,377
I didn't know
your sister got married.

742
00:37:36,377 --> 00:37:37,629
Oh, she didn't.

743
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,340
I just have them call him that
so he'll get the hint.

744
00:37:41,633 --> 00:37:42,884
Hey!
Uncle Kyle!

745
00:37:42,884 --> 00:37:44,218
Shane get down!
Look at me!

746
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,678
Shane, down.

747
00:37:45,678 --> 00:37:47,930
No use
bothering Uncle Kyle

748
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,058
when he's doing something he
knows he should not be doing.

749
00:37:51,851 --> 00:37:54,896
Oh, ain't nothing wrong
with a little harmless fun.

750
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:58,066
Mr. Simmons,
I am moulding a young man here.

751
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:00,068
Please do not contradict me
mid-mould.

752
00:38:02,737 --> 00:38:04,322
Get in the car.

753
00:38:06,115 --> 00:38:07,992
You all stay here.
I will be right back.

754
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:16,000
¶

755
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,128
I told 'em, "Whatever, man,
my cousin's black," you know?

756
00:38:20,797 --> 00:38:22,799
They don't understand
a thing.

757
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:31,391
What the hell?

758
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:36,020
Yeah, baby! Yeah, baby!

759
00:38:36,062 --> 00:38:37,522
Lock and load!

760
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:41,025
Freeze!
What the hell are you doing?

761
00:38:42,402 --> 00:38:43,778
Can't talk, Buck.
Busy.

762
00:38:43,778 --> 00:38:46,697
Oh, hey, Etta.
I didn't know it was you.

763
00:38:46,697 --> 00:38:48,199
We'll, uh, talk later.

764
00:38:50,576 --> 00:38:52,161
Well, you just gonna
let her do that?

765
00:38:52,161 --> 00:38:53,955
It's Etta Milford.

766
00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:56,541
After you've been here longer
you'll understand.

767
00:39:03,172 --> 00:39:04,340
(Door opening)

768
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,343
(Barking)

769
00:39:07,343 --> 00:39:09,762
Yeah, just stay behind
that line right there.

770
00:39:09,762 --> 00:39:11,389
You sure?

771
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:13,099
Oh, I do it every day.

772
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:15,059
Sitzen-sie!

773
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:16,144
That's supposed to
calm him down.

774
00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:18,062
I think
it just pisses him off.

775
00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:19,897
He got a name?

776
00:39:19,897 --> 00:39:21,649
I've taken to calling him
"shut the hell up."

777
00:39:21,691 --> 00:39:24,360
Shut the hell up!

778
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,611
Kind of therapeutic,
ain't it?

779
00:39:25,611 --> 00:39:27,321
Kind of.

780
00:39:29,907 --> 00:39:31,742
Go on back there
and get you something.

781
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:32,743
Pork rinds.

782
00:39:32,743 --> 00:39:35,580
Okay.
Bye.

783
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:39,292
Hey, now, I'm gonna have to
open up a drive-thru,

784
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:41,502
you keep barking
like that.

785
00:40:07,153 --> 00:40:10,573
I don't make much.

786
00:40:10,573 --> 00:40:11,741
Pam's the only thing I got

787
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:14,535
that's worth a damn
in this whole world.

788
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:17,872
All the money I was gonna spend
on her, I gotta spend on this.

789
00:40:17,872 --> 00:40:19,248
And strippers.

790
00:40:22,418 --> 00:40:24,879
Who you think you are?

791
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:26,464
Ever think maybe
it's not your job

792
00:40:26,464 --> 00:40:29,634
to decide what's right
for everybody else?

793
00:40:29,634 --> 00:40:32,428
She is my sister.

794
00:40:34,513 --> 00:40:35,931
That's funny.

795
00:40:35,931 --> 00:40:37,892
You say that
like you own her.

796
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:45,524
(Playing "Notre Dame
Victory March")

797
00:41:10,758 --> 00:41:15,930
¶

798
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:17,264
I don't like that stuff.

799
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:18,641
Well, that's why
it's good for you.

800
00:41:23,229 --> 00:41:25,272
Awful handsome.

801
00:41:28,067 --> 00:41:29,944
(Inaudible dialogue)

802
00:41:32,571 --> 00:41:34,156
Here ya go.

803
00:41:38,536 --> 00:41:40,996
Trouble in paradise?

804
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:43,582
Some guys are just a little
freer than others.

805
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:46,877
Kyle needs help getting herded
into the corral.

806
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:49,338
Is that how you talked about me
before we got married?

807
00:41:49,338 --> 00:41:51,632
Chester, you were born
in the corral.

808
00:41:59,265 --> 00:42:00,433
Oh, man. Bo.

809
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:01,475
What happened?

810
00:42:01,475 --> 00:42:02,768
Zachary happened.

811
00:42:02,768 --> 00:42:04,728
He is renting space.

812
00:42:04,728 --> 00:42:06,939
Temporarily.
Huh.

813
00:42:06,939 --> 00:42:08,107
Yeah.

814
00:42:09,442 --> 00:42:11,735
Let's get this out back.

815
00:42:11,735 --> 00:42:13,445
What's all this?

816
00:42:13,445 --> 00:42:15,072
Santa's workshop.

817
00:42:15,114 --> 00:42:19,076
You see,
this becomes that.

818
00:42:19,118 --> 00:42:20,953
Oh, yeah?

819
00:42:20,953 --> 00:42:22,955
Zachary's out here every night
messing with the furniture.

820
00:42:22,955 --> 00:42:26,292
Yeah. He has got it down
to a science.

821
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:30,004
So he's faking them antiques
he sells.

822
00:42:30,004 --> 00:42:34,675
Yeah, well, can't say
that I agree with it.

823
00:42:39,346 --> 00:42:42,433
But he sells most of 'em
on eBay.

824
00:42:42,433 --> 00:42:44,685
You can sell anything
on eBay.

825
00:42:44,685 --> 00:42:47,938
One guy, he tried to sell
his kidney on eBay.

826
00:42:47,938 --> 00:42:49,273
No!

827
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:50,733
They wouldn't let him.

828
00:42:54,653 --> 00:42:55,654
ETTA:
Ready?

829
00:42:55,654 --> 00:42:57,573
BOTH:
Countdown!

830
00:42:57,573 --> 00:42:59,533
Three, two--

831
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:00,951
Big guns!

832
00:43:00,993 --> 00:43:01,744
(Yelling)

833
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:03,037
Yeah! Right there!

834
00:43:03,078 --> 00:43:04,872
Little bit of this,
little bit of that!

835
00:43:04,872 --> 00:43:08,834
(Yelling)

836
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:10,753
Right there!

837
00:43:12,129 --> 00:43:13,005
Yeah, baby!

838
00:43:13,005 --> 00:43:14,757
Get back up there!

839
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:16,008
Hey!

840
00:43:16,008 --> 00:43:17,843
What the hell
did you say to him?

841
00:43:17,843 --> 00:43:19,553
Say to who?

842
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:21,263
Kyle.

843
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:22,556
Okay, boys.
Come on.

844
00:43:22,556 --> 00:43:24,224
In the house for a minute,
come on.

845
00:43:24,224 --> 00:43:26,393
There you go.
Come on.

846
00:43:26,393 --> 00:43:27,645
We'll finish up
in a minute.

847
00:43:27,645 --> 00:43:29,813
Where do you get off
threatening my boyfriend?

848
00:43:29,813 --> 00:43:31,398
Well, I would hardly call it
a threat.

849
00:43:31,398 --> 00:43:34,610
Etta, he had saved that money
to buy me a ring!

850
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,612
Yeah, a ring, Etta.

851
00:43:36,612 --> 00:43:38,781
You had to go
screw it all up.

852
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:39,782
Hell, I know
he goes that club.

853
00:43:39,782 --> 00:43:41,992
He goes with his boss.
Pam.

854
00:43:41,992 --> 00:43:44,244
For once in your life,
mind your own damn business.

855
00:43:44,244 --> 00:43:45,621
God knows you got enough
problems already

856
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:46,872
stickin' up Chester.

857
00:43:46,872 --> 00:43:48,666
Okay, you need to watch your--
You know what?

858
00:43:48,666 --> 00:43:50,250
The best thing that could
happen to you right now

859
00:43:50,292 --> 00:43:52,586
is if somebody did hear.

860
00:43:57,966 --> 00:44:00,928
(Engine starting)

861
00:44:00,928 --> 00:44:03,180
(Tires squealing)

862
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:12,356
How'd I do?

863
00:44:12,356 --> 00:44:14,149
Six miles an hour.
Ha!

864
00:44:14,149 --> 00:44:16,318
Top that, hotshot.

865
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:17,695
Let me show you
how it's done.

866
00:44:20,364 --> 00:44:21,740
Come on.
Ready?

867
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,330
Ha-ha-ha! Yeah!

868
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,331
Yeah! How was that?

869
00:44:29,331 --> 00:44:31,291
So is this what
you guys do?

870
00:44:34,461 --> 00:44:35,713
Sometimes.

871
00:44:37,131 --> 00:44:39,508
Can I get in on it?

872
00:44:39,508 --> 00:44:41,176
Ante up.

873
00:44:41,176 --> 00:44:42,928
(Laughing)

874
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:51,520
Whoa!

875
00:44:53,397 --> 00:44:56,108
Etta girl!
Just who I wanted to see.

876
00:44:56,108 --> 00:44:57,776
Hey, hey!

877
00:44:57,776 --> 00:44:58,861
What's the rush?

878
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:00,446
Errands.

879
00:45:00,446 --> 00:45:03,240
What? Too busy to see
the deal of a lifetime?

880
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,450
Yeah.

881
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:07,161
Oh, well, what the hey?
I mean, you're here,

882
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:09,413
I'm here,
there's good stuff in there.

883
00:45:09,413 --> 00:45:10,581
Come on.

884
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:12,166
Won't take long.
Come on!

885
00:45:12,166 --> 00:45:13,750
Okay.

886
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,171
(Laughing)

887
00:45:17,212 --> 00:45:19,298
It's your first time.

888
00:45:19,298 --> 00:45:21,842
When was the last time
you had that thing calibrated?

889
00:45:23,177 --> 00:45:27,139
So where's these deals
you keep telling me about?

890
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:30,767
Uh-oh. Sold 'em.

891
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:32,019
Just like that.

892
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,189
Yes, ma'am.
Okay. Yeah.

893
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:37,691
I'm out of here.
Wait. No, wait.

894
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:40,194
Just-- Time out!

895
00:45:40,194 --> 00:45:44,072
I was just about to close,
so perhaps now is a good time

896
00:45:44,072 --> 00:45:45,490
for a grand tour.

897
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:49,203
Maybe show you the ins and outs
of the antique business?

898
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:53,332
Okay. I got a good idea
of the ins and outs

899
00:45:53,332 --> 00:45:55,209
you're referring to,
and no, thank you.

900
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,501
Oh, now, wait, wait.
Come on.

901
00:45:56,501 --> 00:45:59,546
You just never give a guy
a chance.

902
00:46:01,924 --> 00:46:03,967
Get off me!
God!

903
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:05,135
Get off me!

904
00:46:05,135 --> 00:46:07,012
(Glass breaking)

905
00:46:08,263 --> 00:46:09,973
Sh, sh!

906
00:46:18,023 --> 00:46:19,441
That ain't right.

907
00:46:23,862 --> 00:46:25,239
Stay here.
I'm checking it out.

908
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:27,157
Please?

909
00:46:27,157 --> 00:46:28,158
Man!

910
00:46:31,203 --> 00:46:41,254
¶

911
00:46:51,932 --> 00:46:53,350
We're closed!

912
00:46:58,438 --> 00:47:01,024
I'll be damned.

913
00:47:01,066 --> 00:47:02,234
Lipstick.

914
00:47:11,243 --> 00:47:12,661
All right, boy!

915
00:47:14,997 --> 00:47:16,665
Now, let me show you
what's gonna happen

916
00:47:16,665 --> 00:47:19,876
next time your armed robber
friend tries to rob you.

917
00:47:29,302 --> 00:47:31,972
This is a robbery!

918
00:47:31,972 --> 00:47:35,225
Put all your money
into my old sock here.

919
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:36,893
Did you not hear me,
boy?

920
00:47:36,893 --> 00:47:40,063
I said put all your money
into my filthy sock!

921
00:47:42,899 --> 00:47:45,068
God! If you do not put
your money into my sock,

922
00:47:45,068 --> 00:47:48,530
I will you shoot your face
in the face!

923
00:47:49,948 --> 00:47:52,200
I'm sorry, sir. This
transaction cannot be processed

924
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,745
due to the bullet-proofocity
of this security shield

925
00:47:54,745 --> 00:47:56,163
I have installed.
Thank you very much.

926
00:47:56,163 --> 00:47:57,205
How you doing,
Sheriff?

927
00:47:57,205 --> 00:47:58,749
Kyle, boy.

928
00:48:03,128 --> 00:48:04,254
No hole.

929
00:48:06,631 --> 00:48:09,759
Say, if you all are busy,
I can come back later.

930
00:48:09,759 --> 00:48:11,845
No, Kyle's just getting ready
to take that glass down.

931
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:14,014
I just need to speak to you
for a second.

932
00:48:14,014 --> 00:48:17,142
What's up, Ernie?

933
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:19,895
Well, uh, now,

934
00:48:19,895 --> 00:48:21,229
we've known each other
a long time.

935
00:48:21,229 --> 00:48:23,315
Oh, yeah.

936
00:48:23,315 --> 00:48:26,651
Well, last night,

937
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:29,112
I saw something--

938
00:48:29,154 --> 00:48:32,282
What? Boobs?

939
00:48:32,282 --> 00:48:34,701
You see some boobs,
man?

940
00:48:34,743 --> 00:48:36,536
Good boobs?

941
00:48:37,746 --> 00:48:39,164
Zachary!

942
00:48:39,164 --> 00:48:40,957
BO:
He ain't here.

943
00:48:40,957 --> 00:48:42,542
What are you doing here?

944
00:48:42,542 --> 00:48:43,877
Last time I got drunk,

945
00:48:43,877 --> 00:48:46,630
I promised Zach
I'd watch his store sometimes.

946
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:48,798
Drunken promises suck.

947
00:48:48,798 --> 00:48:50,258
Well, where is he?

948
00:48:50,258 --> 00:48:53,178
Got me. I'll tell him
you came by though.

949
00:48:53,178 --> 00:48:55,388
No, no, no.

950
00:48:55,388 --> 00:48:57,098
Ow.

951
00:48:58,934 --> 00:49:00,560
<i>ETTA:
Oh, that's
an antique rosewood table.</i>

952
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,937
<i>Ain't it something?
Jesus.</i>

953
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,820
I bet old Zachary keeps pretty
good records though, don't he?

954
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,447
Yeah, buddy.

955
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,873
Extremely flammable, Ches.

956
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,338
(Laughing)

957
00:49:28,338 --> 00:49:30,173
Okay.
I won't do it no more.

958
00:49:30,215 --> 00:49:32,259
(Laughing)

959
00:49:32,259 --> 00:49:35,178
I told you
he wouldn't like it.

960
00:49:35,178 --> 00:49:37,222
I'm getting some Band-Aids.

961
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:41,351
We gotta talk.

962
00:49:41,351 --> 00:49:43,770
Can it wait?
You screwing Zachary?

963
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:46,147
What?
Answer me!

964
00:49:46,147 --> 00:49:47,983
Ches,
the boys are right upstairs.

965
00:49:47,983 --> 00:49:50,026
That is not
the right answer.

966
00:49:50,026 --> 00:49:52,529
No,
I am not screwing Zachary.

967
00:49:52,529 --> 00:49:53,947
'Cause Ernie says
he saw you two last night.

968
00:49:53,947 --> 00:49:56,199
Oh, Ernie says!

969
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:58,576
I went to ask him about
some antiques.

970
00:49:58,576 --> 00:50:01,788
Turns out he was interested in
a different set of drawers,

971
00:50:01,788 --> 00:50:04,499
so I smacked him.
That's what Ernie saw.

972
00:50:04,499 --> 00:50:06,376
Mm-hm. Well, I went by
his shop this afternoon,

973
00:50:06,376 --> 00:50:08,003
and you know what I found?

974
00:50:08,003 --> 00:50:09,462
I found sales slips.

975
00:50:09,462 --> 00:50:13,299
One for a table,
one for a chair.

976
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:15,260
No Uncle Jeffrey,
no Cousin Jake!

977
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:19,055
You're feeding me shit every day
about "Oh, we gotta save money,"

978
00:50:19,055 --> 00:50:21,474
and you're buying furniture
that we don't need.

979
00:50:21,516 --> 00:50:22,475
I hate furniture!

980
00:50:22,517 --> 00:50:24,394
No, not furniture, Ches.

981
00:50:24,394 --> 00:50:25,979
Investments.

982
00:50:25,979 --> 00:50:28,815
Yeah, see, I saw on TV where
people bring in their antiques,

983
00:50:28,857 --> 00:50:29,941
thinking that
they're worth nothing,

984
00:50:29,941 --> 00:50:32,569
and then they turn out
to be worth thousands!

985
00:50:32,569 --> 00:50:34,571
Not this crap.
Yeah, yeah, Ches, look!

986
00:50:34,571 --> 00:50:36,364
This is 18th century.

987
00:50:36,364 --> 00:50:37,991
I have got a book upstairs

988
00:50:37,991 --> 00:50:41,244
that's got a table that looks
just like this, in a museum.

989
00:50:41,244 --> 00:50:44,581
So later on, we need money for
college, we can sell it!

990
00:50:44,581 --> 00:50:45,999
It's not like
having money in the bank,

991
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:47,751
where you can just spend it.
It's safe.

992
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:49,252
These things,
they appreciate.

993
00:50:49,294 --> 00:50:52,839
They are fakes, Etta!
Oh, the hell they are.

994
00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:54,424
Look at this.

995
00:50:54,466 --> 00:50:58,011
Hand-crafted 1920s
Queen Anne chair with a--

996
00:50:58,011 --> 00:51:00,263
I have been to
the man's workshop.

997
00:51:00,263 --> 00:51:02,599
Christ, our TV's older
than that chair.

998
00:51:09,147 --> 00:51:11,649
Why would he
do that to me?

999
00:51:11,649 --> 00:51:14,611
I can't figure out how
you've been able to

1000
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:16,613
get the money together
to buy 'em in the first place.

1001
00:51:16,613 --> 00:51:18,531
I mean, we're barely
scraping by as it is.

1002
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:21,534
And that maniac
is robbing me and you--

1003
00:51:25,497 --> 00:51:28,166
No.

1004
00:51:28,166 --> 00:51:30,502
Aw, no.

1005
00:51:30,502 --> 00:51:32,712
I'm so sorry, Ches.

1006
00:51:33,546 --> 00:51:34,923
You stole from me?

1007
00:51:34,923 --> 00:51:38,635
No, I stole for us,
for the boys.

1008
00:51:48,728 --> 00:51:58,738
¶

1009
00:51:59,822 --> 00:52:01,824
Where are we going?

1010
00:52:01,824 --> 00:52:03,451
To get a refund.

1011
00:52:19,968 --> 00:52:22,178
Afternoon, Etta.

1012
00:52:22,178 --> 00:52:24,430
You don't strike me as
the murdering type.

1013
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:27,642
How could you cheat me?

1014
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:33,606
How? I tried to steer you
to the real pieces.

1015
00:52:33,606 --> 00:52:35,233
But, no.
You wanted a deal.

1016
00:52:35,233 --> 00:52:36,818
Ever since
that damn TV show,

1017
00:52:36,818 --> 00:52:39,654
everybody wants a deal.

1018
00:52:39,654 --> 00:52:42,782
Have to sell the pieces I make
just to keep the door open.

1019
00:52:42,782 --> 00:52:44,909
That money was for my kids.

1020
00:52:45,827 --> 00:52:47,120
Well, here, call a cop.

1021
00:52:48,705 --> 00:52:51,791
You know,
it is the weirdest thing.

1022
00:52:53,543 --> 00:52:57,088
You say
that money is tight.

1023
00:52:57,088 --> 00:52:59,549
But every time
your husband gets robbed,

1024
00:52:59,549 --> 00:53:01,759
you waltz in here,
flush with cash.

1025
00:53:04,095 --> 00:53:06,222
We're the same person,
Etta.

1026
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:07,890
I'm not saying that's bad.

1027
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:10,393
Maybe the meek
shall inherit the Earth,

1028
00:53:10,393 --> 00:53:11,769
but they sure
live like hell,

1029
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:13,980
waiting for everybody else
to die.

1030
00:53:19,652 --> 00:53:21,070
I didn't think so.

1031
00:53:27,827 --> 00:53:30,496
Don't cross me, Etta.

1032
00:53:30,496 --> 00:53:33,875
Those boys will have
a very hard time

1033
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:36,002
with a mama in prison.

1034
00:53:42,383 --> 00:53:44,343
You ought to
get that gun appraised.

1035
00:53:55,605 --> 00:54:05,656
¶

1036
00:54:35,353 --> 00:54:37,063
I want you boys
to wait here.

1037
00:54:43,319 --> 00:54:45,947
(Rock song playing)

1038
00:54:45,947 --> 00:54:57,333
¶

1039
00:55:02,797 --> 00:55:04,549
God bless the USA, man.

1040
00:55:09,637 --> 00:55:11,430
(Door opening)

1041
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,352
Put your hands up.

1042
00:55:16,352 --> 00:55:17,353
Now!

1043
00:55:21,482 --> 00:55:23,234
Man, this is
my favourite one.

1044
00:55:23,234 --> 00:55:25,486
It's amazing.
Check it.

1045
00:55:27,488 --> 00:55:31,200
Hot damn!
What do you think, man?

1046
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,370
Oh!
God damn!

1047
00:55:34,412 --> 00:55:35,371
There you go.

1048
00:55:42,461 --> 00:55:43,504
Need a hand?

1049
00:55:52,888 --> 00:55:54,223
Where are we going?

1050
00:55:54,223 --> 00:55:55,558
<i>Did you see
Thelma and Louise?</i>

1051
00:55:55,558 --> 00:55:56,642
Who are they?

1052
00:55:56,642 --> 00:55:58,144
Two robbers
that drove off a cliff.

1053
00:55:58,144 --> 00:56:00,646
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1054
00:56:00,646 --> 00:56:02,481
Come on,
hurry it up!

1055
00:56:04,275 --> 00:56:06,527
I'm trying as hard as I--
I'm juts nervous.

1056
00:56:11,824 --> 00:56:13,534
Momma's gonna get
so mad at you.

1057
00:56:13,534 --> 00:56:14,952
Shut up!
You shut up!

1058
00:56:14,952 --> 00:56:16,495
You shut up!
You shut up!

1059
00:56:16,495 --> 00:56:18,914
Hey!
I said, shut up!

1060
00:56:18,914 --> 00:56:20,041
I said, shut up.

1061
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:21,042
(Yelling)

1062
00:56:32,386 --> 00:56:33,596
Hello?

1063
00:56:43,439 --> 00:56:44,607
Shane!

1064
00:56:46,525 --> 00:56:49,236
(Honking)

1065
00:56:49,236 --> 00:56:50,780
That your car, man?

1068

Mom! Mom!

1072
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:03,876
Daddy!

1073
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:07,546

Get in the truck.

1076

1078
00:57:30,653 --> 00:57:32,404
Ches.

1079
00:57:32,404 --> 00:57:33,906
Why were my kids
in that car?

1080
00:57:33,906 --> 00:57:34,907
Do you know
what could've happened?

1081
00:57:34,907 --> 00:57:36,909
They could've been killed.

1082
00:57:36,909 --> 00:57:37,660

1087
00:57:46,126 --> 00:57:48,254
Chester, I'm--

1088
00:57:54,718 --> 00:57:59,974
¶

1089
00:57:59,974 --> 00:58:02,309

1090
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:12,403

1091
00:58:40,014 --> 00:58:41,890
CHRIS:
I don't wanna
wear those ones!

1092
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:43,892
CHESTER:
There the only ones
I can find right now.

1093
00:58:43,892 --> 00:58:46,145
I wear the red ones!
I want Mommy.

1094
00:58:46,145 --> 00:58:48,981
Mommy always knows where
the red ones are!

1095
00:58:50,983 --> 00:58:54,695
¶ But before you judge me ¶

1096
00:58:54,695 --> 00:58:57,615
¶ And find me guilty ¶

1097
00:58:57,615 --> 00:59:00,868
¶ There's just one thing
you should know ¶

1098
00:59:02,494 --> 00:59:04,038
¶ I had ¶

1099
00:59:04,038 --> 00:59:08,083
¶ Good intentions ¶

1100
00:59:10,294 --> 00:59:13,297
¶ I didn't mean
to hurt anyone ¶

1101
00:59:15,257 --> 00:59:17,009
¶ 'Cause I had ¶

1102
00:59:17,009 --> 00:59:20,137
¶ Good intentions ¶

1103
00:59:20,137 --> 00:59:23,098
¶ Good intentions ¶

1104
00:59:23,098 --> 00:59:25,934
¶ For all the bad things
I've done ¶

1105
00:59:32,483 --> 00:59:34,485
(Crying)

1106
00:59:38,697 --> 00:59:41,950
¶ 'Cause there ain't nothing
I can say ¶

1107
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,207
¶ If I could change it ¶

1108
00:59:48,207 --> 00:59:51,418
¶ I'd arrange it ¶

1109
00:59:51,418 --> 00:59:54,880
¶ And do it all differently ¶

1110
00:59:56,215 --> 00:59:57,758
¶ And I had ¶

1111
00:59:57,758 --> 01:00:01,011
¶ Good intentions... ¶

1112
01:00:05,974 --> 01:00:09,103
I've been looking for you
all night.

1113
01:00:09,103 --> 01:00:11,063
Damn it, Etta!
You scared the crap out of me.

1114
01:00:13,023 --> 01:00:14,608
Geez, Pam.

1115
01:00:21,448 --> 01:00:23,992
Well, come on in.
Jesus.

1116
01:00:29,873 --> 01:00:31,750
So how are the boys?

1117
01:00:33,127 --> 01:00:36,547
Good as can be expected.

1118
01:00:36,547 --> 01:00:37,464
Ches?

1119
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:42,261
I think you need to give him
a little space right now.

1120
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:49,768
Etta.

1121
01:00:49,768 --> 01:00:52,271
Etta, you have always been
so strong.

1122
01:00:54,523 --> 01:00:55,941
Honey, maybe it's time
you just start

1123
01:00:55,941 --> 01:00:57,776
putting a little faith
in other people.

1124
01:01:08,078 --> 01:01:12,332
You know, I was there
the day that Daddy died.

1125
01:01:12,332 --> 01:01:13,750
You were just a baby.

1126
01:01:18,714 --> 01:01:19,965
I made a promise to him

1127
01:01:19,965 --> 01:01:23,468
that I would never
need anyone,

1128
01:01:23,468 --> 01:01:26,096
never rely on them.

1129
01:01:26,096 --> 01:01:28,223
And I would take care
of me and you,

1130
01:01:28,223 --> 01:01:32,185
and get a good education.

1131
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:36,106
And then Momma left...

1132
01:01:39,401 --> 01:01:41,153
and I failed.

1133
01:01:43,655 --> 01:01:46,658
I didn't get an education.
I didn't take care of me.

1134
01:01:46,658 --> 01:01:47,909
I didn't
take care of you.

1135
01:01:47,909 --> 01:01:50,078
Hell, I haven't
taken care of anybody.

1136
01:01:50,078 --> 01:01:52,831
You have not failed!

1137
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:58,211
Look,

1138
01:01:58,211 --> 01:02:00,505
Daddy's gone!

1139
01:02:00,505 --> 01:02:03,759
But honey,
we're all still here!

1140
01:02:03,759 --> 01:02:06,261
And we're gonna
work this out.

1141
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:09,723
Your family
still loves you.

1142
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,436
Even Kyle still loves you.

1143
01:02:17,773 --> 01:02:19,274
I flattened his tires.

1144
01:02:19,274 --> 01:02:21,902
Yeah. I know.

1145
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:29,242
Let's go get
some breakfast.

1146
01:02:29,242 --> 01:02:30,952
Come on.

1158
01:02:57,229 --> 01:03:00,023
So I make nice, and
Chester lets me come back home.

1159
01:03:00,023 --> 01:03:01,858
Yeah, that is the plan.

1160
01:03:01,858 --> 01:03:04,820
Except the same old thing
is gonna start happening again.

1161

You're gonna
start robbing him again?

1162

No!

1163
01:03:08,573 --> 01:03:11,243
He's gonna spend all of our
money on them crazy inventions,

1164
01:03:11,243 --> 01:03:12,536
and then the boys
are no closer to college,

1165

they really need.

make you proud.

1244
01:08:15,129 --> 01:08:20,051
¶ This heart just needs
some time to grow... ¶

1245
01:08:20,051 --> 01:08:21,678
No,
I was a Pro-Bowler.

1246
01:08:21,678 --> 01:08:23,554
Shoot, you were tight-end
and outside linebacker?

1247
01:08:23,554 --> 01:08:25,056
Yeah!

1248
01:08:25,056 --> 01:08:27,266
You know, I grew up
ten minutes from here.

1249
01:08:27,266 --> 01:08:28,601
Oh, yeah,
that's awesome.

1250
01:08:28,601 --> 01:08:29,602
Yeah.

1251
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:36,401
All right,
right back here.

1252
01:08:36,401 --> 01:08:38,111
Is that the actual helmet
you wore?

1253
01:08:38,111 --> 01:08:39,987
Hell, yeah!
You want to try it on?

1254
01:08:39,987 --> 01:08:41,406
Maybe later.

1255
01:08:46,994 --> 01:08:48,663
Good morning,
Buck!

1256
01:08:50,289 --> 01:08:53,084
Ernie said that
I could use the computer.

1257
01:08:54,335 --> 01:08:56,713
What you got
on Ernie, anyway?

1258
01:08:58,631 --> 01:09:01,843
After today,
nothing ever again.

1259
01:09:01,843 --> 01:09:03,344
(Chuckling)

1260
01:09:09,016 --> 01:09:14,522
¶

1261
01:09:14,522 --> 01:09:16,190
Thank you very much.

1262
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,525
Thank you.

1263
01:09:17,525 --> 01:09:19,527
You two handsome boys
be safe going home now,

1264
01:09:19,527 --> 01:09:21,904
all right?
Thank you.

1265
01:09:21,904 --> 01:09:23,865
Hey,
how ya doing?

1266
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,202
(Sirens blaring)

1267
01:09:28,202 --> 01:09:29,996
<i>Pull over, please.</i>

1268
01:09:31,456 --> 01:09:34,542
These prices
are absolutely amazing!

1269
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:36,752
I don't know
how you can do it!

1270
01:09:36,752 --> 01:09:39,213
Neither can I.

1271
01:09:39,213 --> 01:09:40,882
Hey, baby.

1272
01:09:40,882 --> 01:09:43,759
Oh, such a thoughtful
young man.

1273
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:45,470
You should
hold on tight.

1274
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:47,513
Oh, I intend to.

1275
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:52,643
Uh, what seems to be
the problem, Sheriff?

1276
01:09:52,643 --> 01:09:56,481
Violation of Section 23.32.31
of the vehicle code,

1277
01:09:56,481 --> 01:09:57,315
you've got
a broken tail light.

1278
01:09:57,315 --> 01:09:58,649
License and registration,
please.

1279
01:09:58,649 --> 01:09:59,567
Well, I can take it
to the garage right now.

1280
01:09:59,567 --> 01:10:01,444
License and registration,
please.

1281
01:10:08,242 --> 01:10:11,078
Hey!
That's my table, jackass!

1282
01:10:11,078 --> 01:10:13,414
Oh, no, luckily there's more
where that came from.

1283
01:10:13,414 --> 01:10:14,665
It's fine.

1284
01:10:14,665 --> 01:10:17,251
It's fine, seriously.

1285
01:10:19,170 --> 01:10:20,671
Wha--?
Wait, that's not mine.

1286
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,131
Oh, oh, I see.

1287
01:10:22,131 --> 01:10:24,217
Suppose the pot fairy
left it there?

1288
01:10:24,217 --> 01:10:25,843
It's oregano.
Smell that.

1289
01:10:25,843 --> 01:10:27,637
It's oregano, Sheriff! Smell it!
Out of the car.

1290
01:10:29,263 --> 01:10:31,974
I don't smoke,
and I don't cook.

1291
01:10:31,974 --> 01:10:33,726
You have got to be
kidding!

1292
01:10:33,726 --> 01:10:35,436
Hands on-- You have the right
to remain silent.

1293
01:10:35,436 --> 01:10:37,188
Anything you say--

1294
01:10:37,188 --> 01:10:38,981
What the hell
are you talk--?

1295
01:10:38,981 --> 01:10:42,485
Sir, I don't get to say this
very often.

1296
01:10:42,485 --> 01:10:44,820
Please,
don't ruin the moment.

1297
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:46,030
Yes, sir.

1298
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:47,990
You have the right
to remain silent.

1299
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,784
Anything you say
will be used against you--

1300
01:10:49,784 --> 01:10:52,245
Sheriff, that's my stuff
in that truck.

1301
01:10:52,245 --> 01:10:53,663
That's the stuff
in my store!

1302
01:10:53,663 --> 01:10:56,457
They're taking my stuff!
That's my stuff in that truck!

1303
01:10:56,457 --> 01:10:59,627
How could it be your stuff,
if it's in their truck?

1304
01:10:59,627 --> 01:11:00,920
That's my stuff
right there.

1305
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,213
Lay down.

1306
01:11:07,635 --> 01:11:09,637
(Door opening)

1307
01:11:13,265 --> 01:11:15,309
ZACHARY:
This is bull, Sheriff!

1308
01:11:15,309 --> 01:11:16,477
I get a phone call!

1309
01:11:16,477 --> 01:11:18,479
Yeah, you'll get
your phone call.

1310
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:19,605
Wait, wait.

1311
01:11:19,605 --> 01:11:21,107
There's two empty cells
over here.

1312
01:11:21,107 --> 01:11:23,109
Why am I in here
with a naked guy?

1313
01:11:23,109 --> 01:11:24,318
MAN:
Come to Papa.

1314
01:11:25,653 --> 01:11:26,946
How's it coming?

1315
01:11:26,946 --> 01:11:29,198
Almost done
scanning these.

1316
01:11:29,198 --> 01:11:31,951
Okay. Let me know
if you need any help.

1317
01:11:31,951 --> 01:11:33,911
Thanks, Ernie.
Sure.

1318
01:11:33,911 --> 01:11:36,205
Hey, you know your friend
Zachary?

1319
01:11:36,205 --> 01:11:38,499
Turns out he's wanted
in four states.

1320
01:11:39,917 --> 01:11:43,170
Mail fraud, fraud,
larceny, assault,

1321
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:45,005
mayhem.

1322
01:11:45,005 --> 01:11:46,257
Wow.

1323
01:11:46,257 --> 01:11:48,050
Yeah.

1324
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:51,262
Worst thing to slither through
this town.

1325
01:11:51,262 --> 01:11:53,764
And I got him.

1326
01:11:53,764 --> 01:11:55,516
Feels good

1327
01:11:55,516 --> 01:11:58,185
to finally feel like
the sheriff.

1328
01:11:58,185 --> 01:12:00,730
Ernie,
you are the sheriff.

1329
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:02,148
I know.

1330
01:12:02,148 --> 01:12:04,525
Say.

1331
01:12:04,525 --> 01:12:07,862
What's that place Chester
took you for your anniversary?

1332
01:12:07,862 --> 01:12:08,988
Saranby?

1333
01:12:08,988 --> 01:12:10,948
Saranby.

1334
01:12:10,948 --> 01:12:14,577
Yeah, I was going through
the closet last night,

1335
01:12:14,577 --> 01:12:16,829
and Angela's got
this old dress,

1336
01:12:16,829 --> 01:12:19,373
and it's been awhile since
I gave her a reason to wear it.

1337
01:12:22,334 --> 01:12:25,713
Yeah. I got some
pretty spiffy duds myself.

1338
01:12:25,713 --> 01:12:27,047
They're a little tight,

1339
01:12:27,047 --> 01:12:31,051
but I figure if I cut out
the ice cream...

1340
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:35,473
I think that sounds like
a really good idea.

1341
01:12:35,473 --> 01:12:37,683
Yeah, I know
you think so.

1342
01:12:40,227 --> 01:12:50,279
¶

1343
01:13:01,373 --> 01:13:02,541
Can we open them?
Can we open them?

1344
01:13:02,541 --> 01:13:04,001
I don't know. Do you think
they can open them?

1345
01:13:04,001 --> 01:13:05,002
CHESTER:
I think they can.

1346
01:13:05,002 --> 01:13:07,129
I think it's Christmas.

1347
01:13:07,129 --> 01:13:09,173
Here's Shane, here's Chris,
and there's Mom.

1348
01:13:09,173 --> 01:13:11,133
Merry Christmas.

1349
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:12,426
All right, guys,
rip into them...

1350
01:13:21,435 --> 01:13:23,854
<i>Merry Christmas,
you got a hair dryer!</i>

1351
01:13:23,854 --> 01:13:26,607
<i>Whoo!</i>

1352
01:13:26,607 --> 01:13:27,816
<i>Hey, that's my foot!</i>

1353
01:13:31,904 --> 01:13:33,739
Is Mommy here?

1354
01:13:35,282 --> 01:13:38,869
Shh.
Go back to sleep.

1355
01:13:38,869 --> 01:13:40,829
I thought
I heard Mommy.

1356
01:13:43,749 --> 01:13:45,542
She's not here.

1357
01:13:51,131 --> 01:13:53,175
¶ I know ¶

1358
01:13:53,175 --> 01:13:56,303
¶ I could be good for you ¶

1359
01:13:56,303 --> 01:13:57,846
¶ And I know ¶

1360
01:13:57,846 --> 01:13:59,848
¶ Afraid of escaping you ¶

1361
01:14:09,817 --> 01:14:10,818
Sheriff!

1362
01:14:12,695 --> 01:14:14,738
Don't make me come in there
after you.

1363
01:14:16,824 --> 01:14:18,409
Hey!

1364
01:14:18,409 --> 01:14:19,994
(Buzzing)

1365
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:24,623
Hey, you know,
I got a cot in there.

1366
01:14:24,623 --> 01:14:26,417
You look like a candidate.
You could use it.

1367
01:14:26,417 --> 01:14:29,545
No, I'm okay.
I gotta get up to Atlanta.

1368
01:14:29,545 --> 01:14:31,839
No, not like that,
you're not.

1369
01:14:31,839 --> 01:14:33,340
We're taking
little miss sunshine.

1370
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:34,800
Why don't you hop on in?

1371
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,386
That's all right, Ernie.
Thanks anyway.

1372
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:38,887
(Banging)

1373
01:14:38,887 --> 01:14:40,681
I said, simmer down!

1374
01:14:40,681 --> 01:14:43,183
I'm gonna have to give you
a little pepper spray.

1375
01:14:43,183 --> 01:14:44,435
There's a bumblebee!
Ow!

1376
01:14:46,895 --> 01:14:49,106
Ow!

1377
01:14:49,106 --> 01:14:50,816
(Laughing)

1378
01:14:50,816 --> 01:14:52,484
Some people never learn.

1379
01:14:53,902 --> 01:14:57,197
All right.
Stop it!

1380
01:14:57,197 --> 01:14:58,282
Oh. Hey, Ernie!

1381
01:14:58,282 --> 01:15:00,284
The, um...

1382
01:15:00,284 --> 01:15:02,995
(Coughing)

1383
01:15:02,995 --> 01:15:06,123
I think I'll take a--

1384
01:15:06,123 --> 01:15:07,958
You okay?

1385
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:09,918
I'm gonna be all right.

1386
01:15:11,628 --> 01:15:21,555
¶

1387
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:37,404
Hey, Etta,
I'll be right with ya.

1388
01:15:41,742 --> 01:15:43,160
Yeah, this is Chester.

1389
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:44,912
I'm getting robbed again.

1390
01:15:44,912 --> 01:15:48,665
Oh, yeah, it's her.

1391
01:15:48,665 --> 01:15:51,418
What do you mean,
you're in the middle of din--?

1392
01:15:51,418 --> 01:15:52,836
Ernie, damn it!

1393
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:57,257
Mr. Simmons
brought this by.

1394
01:15:57,257 --> 01:15:58,967
Thought
you might be needing it.

1395
01:16:00,385 --> 01:16:02,930
This completes
the matching set.

1396
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,098
We've had a slow day
around here.

1397
01:16:05,098 --> 01:16:09,144
But, uh, I could let you have
a couple hundred dollars.

1398
01:16:10,354 --> 01:16:12,481
Don't.

1399
01:16:12,481 --> 01:16:15,692
All right.
See what's in the wallet, then.

1400
01:16:15,692 --> 01:16:17,110
Chester.

1401
01:16:19,613 --> 01:16:22,032
You know how stubborn
I can get.

1402
01:16:22,032 --> 01:16:24,618
And then I start getting
all these ideas in my head.

1403
01:16:24,618 --> 01:16:27,371
Like stealing all our money.

1404
01:16:27,371 --> 01:16:31,124
I know
it don't make sense.

1405
01:16:31,124 --> 01:16:34,545
I always wanted the boys to have
more opportunities than we did.

1406
01:16:34,545 --> 01:16:37,047
And you didn't trust me
to earn it?

1407
01:16:38,715 --> 01:16:42,219
No.
And that's where I was wrong.

1408
01:16:51,645 --> 01:16:52,729
Oh, what?

1409
01:16:52,729 --> 01:16:53,814
Taking the money
wasn't enough,

1410
01:16:53,814 --> 01:16:56,483
you need to steal
my nut buster?

1411
01:16:56,483 --> 01:16:59,111
I took him to Atlanta to meet
that manufacturing guy

1412
01:16:59,111 --> 01:17:02,239
you talked about.

1413
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:04,908
First batch of a hundred
should be ready,

1414
01:17:04,908 --> 01:17:06,493
about next week.

1415
01:17:06,493 --> 01:17:09,204
First batch?

1416
01:17:09,204 --> 01:17:11,081
I ordered two.

1417
01:17:12,332 --> 01:17:14,584
Two hundred?

1418
01:17:14,584 --> 01:17:15,919
Are you crazy?
'Cause I--

1419
01:17:15,919 --> 01:17:17,087
I can't sell 200.

1420
01:17:17,087 --> 01:17:19,131
I don't even know
if I could sell one.

1421
01:17:20,007 --> 01:17:22,968
Well, you already did.

1422
01:17:24,011 --> 01:17:25,804
$21.50 on eBay.

1423
01:17:25,804 --> 01:17:27,931
Huh?

1424
01:17:27,931 --> 01:17:30,100
It says here that,
uh,

1425
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,102
18 folks bid on it,

1426
01:17:32,102 --> 01:17:35,022
which ain't bad
for a one-day auction.

1427
01:17:35,022 --> 01:17:38,775
At eleven bucks a piece
to produce,

1428
01:17:38,775 --> 01:17:42,487
you just made ten dollars.

1429
01:17:42,487 --> 01:17:44,698
Ten dollars.

1430
01:17:44,698 --> 01:17:47,993
Ten dollars
times 200 nut busters--

1431
01:17:47,993 --> 01:17:50,287
That's $2,000!

1432
01:17:50,287 --> 01:17:52,622
And maybe that's the start

1433
01:17:52,622 --> 01:17:55,042
of our college fund.

1434
01:17:55,042 --> 01:17:57,544
One of 'em made it.

1435
01:17:57,544 --> 01:17:59,087
I did it.

1436
01:17:59,087 --> 01:18:01,214
Yeah, you did.

1437
01:18:01,214 --> 01:18:11,266
¶

1438
01:18:18,315 --> 01:18:19,983
Now, let's get you home.

1439
01:18:19,983 --> 01:18:22,611
I know a couple of boys
who miss their mom.

1440
01:18:22,611 --> 01:18:31,745
¶

1441
01:18:31,745 --> 01:18:32,954
<i>As far as this gun,</i>

1442
01:18:32,954 --> 01:18:35,165
<i>it comes from
the Civil War era.</i>

1443
01:18:35,165 --> 01:18:37,709
<i>Interestingly,
it's surprisingly similar</i>

1444
01:18:37,709 --> 01:18:40,629
<i>to the same rifle
that General Robert E. Lee</i>

1445
01:18:40,629 --> 01:18:43,632
<i>supposedly surrendered
to Ulysses S. Grant</i>

1446
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:46,051
<i>at the conclusion
of the Civil War.</i>

1447
01:18:46,051 --> 01:18:49,346
<i>Now, Grant returned it
many, many years later.</i>

1448
01:18:49,346 --> 01:18:51,807
<i>But do not
get your hopes up.</i>

1449
01:18:51,807 --> 01:18:54,768
<i>'Cause this is not
Robert E. Lee's rifle,</i>

1450
01:18:54,768 --> 01:18:57,604
<i>which is distinguished by
his initials etched into</i>

1451
01:18:57,604 --> 01:18:59,314
<i>the trigger guard here.</i>

1452
01:18:59,314 --> 01:19:02,776
<i>Sadly, that rifle
is lost to history.</i>

1453
01:19:02,776 --> 01:19:04,778
<i>Its whereabouts unknown.</i>

1454
01:19:04,778 --> 01:19:08,198
<i>Now, the very fine condition
of your gun means</i>

1455
01:19:08,198 --> 01:19:09,449
<i>that at auction,</i>

1456
01:19:09,449 --> 01:19:12,661
<i>it would fetch $6,000
to $8,000.</i>

1457
01:19:12,661 --> 01:19:15,413
<i>However, if Lee's gun</i>

1458
01:19:15,413 --> 01:19:17,165
<i>was to show up
at auction,</i>

1459
01:19:17,165 --> 01:19:19,417
<i>that number
moves closer to</i>

1460
01:19:19,417 --> 01:19:22,254
<i>one million dollars.</i>

1461
01:19:22,254 --> 01:19:23,630
<i>MAN:
Wow.</i>

1462
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:25,632
<i>Good gracious.</i>

1463
