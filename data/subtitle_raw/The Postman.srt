<i>KOM EL NAHL (Bees Nest)</i>

2
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,940
- Good morning.
- Welcome.

3
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,360
Is this Kom El Nahl?

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,400
I mean, how do I get there?

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,690
- I'm the new postmaster.
- Welcome, sir.

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,000
- Thank you.
- The village is down there.

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,900
- Is it far?
- No, only 2 kilometers.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,680
Not bad.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,680
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,410
THE POSTMAN

00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,820
Shukry Sarhan

12
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,090
Zizi Mustafa

13
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,650
Directed by Hussein Kamal

14
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,960
Out of my way.

15
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,330
Move it, now.

16
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,780
Scram.

17
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,850
Come here.
Where's the mayor's house?

18
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,450
It's this way.

19
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,060
Beat it.

20
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,740
Hello.

21
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,090
Good morning to you.

22
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,570
Isn't this the mayor's house?

23
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,250
Yes.

24
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
I need him.

25
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,180
Where's the mayor?

26
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,970
At mister Salameh's.

27
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,900
I am Abbas Hussein, the postmaster.

28
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,370
Welcome. Glad you made it.

29
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,050
You, boy.

30
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,840
Tell the mayor the postmaster's here.

31
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Please.

32
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,560
Please sit.

33
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,260
You must be tired.

34
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Mohammad.

35
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,970
Make us some tea.

36
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,600
It's a bad harvest.

37
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,250
- Is this the whole alfalfa harvest?
- Yes.

38
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,980
Two boxes only?

39
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,040
You father used to get
at least 10 per harvest.

40
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,900
The bees are abandoning me.

41
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,730
They're going elsewhere.

42
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,250
- Mister mayor.
- What is it?

43
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,050
The new postmaster is here.

44
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,220
Is he with you?

45
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,160
He's in your house with the deputy.

46
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,570
- Are you staying here?
- I'll come with you.

47
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,970
Today, in Asyut, the grand opening...

48
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,410
of the new American school...

49
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,290
for girls, free of charge...

50
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,100
for reading...

51
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,760
and writing...

52
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,920
and sewing, and cooking...

53
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
and many other skills...

54
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,260
What is this fellow going on about?

55
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:12,600
You should meet mister <i>Car-Tar</i>...

56
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,010
Hey, you there.

57
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,050
The mayor wants a word.

58
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,380
- Where are you from?
- Asyut.

59
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,980
- What are you shouting about?
- About a school, sir.

60
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,860
A new school...

61
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,660
with boarding for girls.

62
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,340
School?

63
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,450
For girls?

64
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
In Asyut.

65
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,480
Who would have thought?

66
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,460
And how do you get in?

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,420
If a girl is 16, can she go?

68
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,050
Yes, she can.

69
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,820
- If she can read and write.
- Of course she can.

70
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,610
You want to send your girl to school?
Have you no shame?

71
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,000
She's a young woman now.

72
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:02,130
Asyut boy, you leave this place now,
and don't let me catch you again.

73
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,330
Yes, sir.

74
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,690
Here's the flier.

75
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,140
- It has the address and the details.
- Scram.

76
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,960
Don't go for this modern nonsense.

77
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,820
Keep your daughter safe in her house.

78
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,660
Why shouldn't I send her?

79
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,730
The flier says she'll be
very well supervised.

80
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,880
She'll be with other young girls.

81
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,130
Times have changed, mayor.

82
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,880
It's not like the old days.

83
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,740
You know how things are now.

84
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,100
It will do us good.

85
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,180
She might marry a clerk...

86
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,330
and work as a teacher...

87
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,410
for extra income.

88
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,460
- You want her to work, too?
- Yes.

89
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,330
This is none of my business anyway.

90
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,280
Let's go see the postmaster.

91
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,560
- Yes, let's go.
- I'll need to discuss a matter...

92
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,130
Welcome, welcome.

93
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:54,690
Thank you.

94
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,280
We got word two weeks ago
that you were coming.

95
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,010
Sit down, deputy.

96
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,050
It took me a while to arrange the move.

97
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,100
Are you married?

98
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
No, I am not.

99
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,930
I support my mother and sisters.
My father is gone.

100
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,180
So you're single?

101
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,940
- Yes.
- And how will you live here?

102
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,020
Pardon me for intruding.

103
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,770
Like others.

104
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,860
I'll try to find a small place to stay.

105
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,220
Here?

106
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,600
In Kom El Nahl?

107
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,940
You won't.

108
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,240
This is the countryside. The only
way to get a house is to build one.

109
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,920
Besides, folks don't like
to rent out to single men.

110
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,060
What then? Where will I live?

111
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,040
You'll have to live in Asyut.

112
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,340
- And commute everyday?
- Yes.

113
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,600
Two hours by train from here to there.

114
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
2 hours?

115
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,520
Plus 2 kilometers walking...

116
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,880
both ways everyday?
No way. Impossible.

117
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,890
- Where is Smedah?
- He is staying in Bani Hussein tonight.

118
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,850
Smedah is quite a fellow.

119
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,500
He has the keys to the post office.

120
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,040
He's gone to Bani Hussein.
His second wife lives there.

121
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,260
He should be here in the morning.

122
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,540
I don't know.

123
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,890
Before starting work, I need
to know where I'll stay.

124
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,580
Asyut will not work out.

125
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,040
Don't you worry, my friend.

126
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,480
I'll find a suitable solution for you.

127
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Tell me, mayor.

128
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,330
There's your old house...

129
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,856
How about it?

130
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,300
Indeed.

131
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,100
I was thinking of that.

132
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,040
Let's eat first and then go see it.
Or maybe...

133
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,420
we should go and see it before sunset.

134
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,280
We will send Jamilah to school in Asyut.

135
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,160
We'll do as you say.

136
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,700
But...

137
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,360
Will she commute to Asyut everyday?

138
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,480
No, she will stay there.

139
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Really?

140
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:20,770
Away from her folks?

141
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,420
So what?

142
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,560
It's a boarding school.

143
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,100
It's run by priests and nuns.

144
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,420
She will be closely supervised.

145
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,530
When will she go?

146
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,740
She will leave tomorrow.

147
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,120
I'll take her.

148
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,120
I'll drop her off.

149
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,260
I won't leave her...

150
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,600
until I am sure she'll be safe there.

151
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,210
You're going to Asyut.
You're leaving tomorrow.

152
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,860
Your father decided.

153
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,080
Get me the rent contract.

154
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,650
Let's go.

155
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,490
Please come in.

156
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:03,890
This...

157
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,140
is where the mayor used to
live before he was mayor.

158
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,560
It's a very good house.

159
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,080
It's very solid.

160
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,620
Please, it's too much, don't exaggerate.

161
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,140
It does not compare to city homes.

162
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:23,680
But it will do here.

163
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,340
Tell me...

164
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,100
What's your name?

165
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,890
- Abbas Hussein.
- Tell me, mister Abbas...

166
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,090
Have you brought any furniture with you?

167
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,960
How much is it for?

168
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,560
40 pennies only.

169
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,940
Here's the contract.

170
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,530
This...

171
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,640
It's a room full of junk.
I have the key.

172
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,320
You won't need it.

173
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,850
Why would you need 2 rooms?

174
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,620
Congratulations.

175
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,920
You pay me when you can.

176
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,170
There's no rush.

177
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,060
Let me know if you need anything.

178
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,420
Goodbye now.

179
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,170
Goodbye.

180
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,170
Mariam, my heart is beating fast.

181
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,210
That's normal.
This is the first time you go away.

182
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,100
Soon you will be very happy.

183
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
Dear me.

184
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,580
I wish I could leave this place.

185
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,380
Can you take me with you?

186
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
I wish I could.

187
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,620
I'm afraid to go alone.

188
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,340
Mariam.

189
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Are you done?

190
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,690
Go make her some food for the journey.

191
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,980
Yes.

192
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,660
This trip is making me nervous.

193
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,290
God help me.

194
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,220
You're a big girl, you'll behave well.

195
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,920
Were you afraid something bad happened?

196
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,520
That's how peasants are.

197
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,540
They're upset that they didn't
slaughter it before she died.

198
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,320
It's a big loss.

199
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,900
They can't use her meat now.

200
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,530
That would be a sin.

201
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,460
Although some of them don't care.

202
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,280
Someone will sell it to a butcher.

203
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,810
But everyone saw it's dead.

204
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,140
You're right, but some don't care.

205
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,780
The postman's here!

206
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,940
Get out of the way.

207
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,840
Hello, sir. Glad you made it.

208
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,410
I am sorry I am late.

209
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,850
It seems your new wife lives far away.

210
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,770
They've told you?

211
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,700
The mayor can't keep a secret.

212
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,800
The keys stay with me.

213
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,340
From now on, you come on time.

214
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,140
It is too early for this hassle.

215
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,980
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

216
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,880
I said nothing.

217
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,800
What's all this?

218
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,450
A cow too?

219
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,050
How very nice.

220
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,680
A great start.

221
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
Go tend to her.

222
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,900
Does she need stamps?
Or is she mailing a letter?

223
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,680
What are you looking at?

224
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,730
Go get it out of here.

225
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,920
Send it back to its owner now.

226
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,290
Got it?

227
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,240
And what's this?

228
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,760
A little extra income in my free time.

229
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,010
What free time?

230
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,340
Your commute time to Bani Hussein?
Between the old and new wife?

231
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,290
Tell me, is this a post office...

232
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
or a stable?

233
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:01,960
What do you think?

234
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,400
It's always been like this.

235
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,180
It's not my place.

236
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,410
No, it isn't.

237
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,480
It's the government's place.

238
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,130
The government pays you to
keep it clean and tidy...

239
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,160
not to sell tomatoes in it, dear fellow.

240
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,860
Don't 'dear fellow' me.

241
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,440
I'm the mayor's relative.
I won't have you mocking me.

242
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,740
How very impressive.

243
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,930
So you're related.

244
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,250
Listen, mister relative.

245
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,080
I will write a report on
you and send it to Cairo.

246
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,540
If you don't wise up, I'll
demand your transfer.

247
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,210
Go tell your relative.

248
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,140
Now, mister relative...

249
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,460
Get a broom, and clean this mess up.

250
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,960
- How long have these been here?
- About a month.

251
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,170
Since they fired the old postmaster.

252
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,480
I got rid of him.

253
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,010
I ruined him.

254
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,380
I have money orders.
I want to keep them here.

255
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,880
- Where's the money order file?
- The police confiscated it.

256
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,940
Open a new one.

257
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,340
You see, the old postmaster
was a modern fellow, just like you.

258
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,720
He thought the village was backward,
and hated it.

259
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,560
- Can you come tomorrow?
- Sure, why not?

260
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,290
He started to drink and gamble...

261
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,280
with the accountant and
the station agent.

262
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,650
- That's when he began embezzling.
- What are these tales?

263
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,720
Better start working.

264
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,690
I don't want to hear such talk again.

265
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,300
I'm going to deliver the mail.

266
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,760
You better make this place
suitable for human beings.

267
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,490
Got it?

268
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,370
Hello.

269
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:41,410
Hello.

270
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,760
- Welcome.
- Give me some pastrami.

271
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,860
- We're out.
- Give me some sardines.

272
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,080
- No.
- How about some cheese?

273
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,530
- No one buys such things.
- Just take some salmon.

274
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:53,450
Hello, mister agent.

275
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,050
I don't like salmon.

276
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,580
Once, I had some, and I got sick.

277
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,860
Then you need to stop by
the butcher for some meat.

278
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,330
Come with me.

279
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,680
- Where are you staying?
- The mayor's old house.

280
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,120
Watch out, that man is a snake.

281
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,540
This whole place is bad.

282
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,810
- You know...
- Yes?

283
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,220
I have mail for Izz Abou Kfour.

284
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,450
- You must know where that is.
- It took me 3 years of misery...

285
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,330
But I now know all of it. Show me.

286
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,250
Alright.

287
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,940
You go this way.

288
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,180
The villages are left and right.

289
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,400
They're separated by 2 kilometers.

290
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,090
How did you end up in this dump?

291
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,490
A promotion.

292
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,600
From a clerk in Cairo...

293
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,640
to a postmaster here.

294
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,520
In this dump, as you say.

295
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,200
- Yes, Khalil?
- Restroom, sir.

296
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,200
- What?
- Restroom.

297
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,840
Restroom again? What is this?

298
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,360
Enough. Sit down.

299
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,360
Please sir, this is the last time.

300
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,140
Fine.

301
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,730
Write it down.

302
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,250
Khalil, stop this nonsense.

303
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,930
- I have news from our cousin.
- Is that why you're here?

304
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,300
I know why you're here, you naughty boy.

305
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,420
- Isn't this your friend?
- Yes, it's Jamilah. What do you want?

306
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,490
Nothing. Just say hi.

307
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,800
- Come here.
- Fine.

308
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,520
Leave, before the principal sees you.

309
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,800
Don't forget to write to our cousin.

310
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,600
I'm leaving.

311
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,170
Send my regards.

312
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,370
Are you asleep?

313
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,810
I can't.

314
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,170
Wasn't that Khalil earlier?

315
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,280
Yes, my brother Khalil.

316
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,960
- Who did you think it was?
- I didn't think. I just got scared.

317
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,920
He had news from our cousin.

318
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,250
You run away every time.

319
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,570
- Why don't you talk to him?
- And say what?

320
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,700
I don't know.

321
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,570
Anything.

322
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,980
I think he likes you.

323
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:10,900
Hello, Darwish.

324
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,040
How are you?

325
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,460
Impossible.

326
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,170
Don't mention it again.

327
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,250
Abbas effendi, be reasonable.

328
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,560
The agricultural agent
needs a place to stay.

329
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,160
You have no use for that room anyway.

330
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,880
He can stay there.

331
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,300
- It makes sense.
- You want to rent it twice?

332
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,210
- No way.
- I am appealing to your good sense.

333
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,460
You better not go against me.

334
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,450
- What is this? A threat?
- Not at all.

335
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:07,330
- Remember that I rule this place.
- You rule?

336
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,850
That's right, I rule.

337
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,850
I rule.

338
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,220
We'll see, postmaster.

339
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,560
Time will tell. Go.

340
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,530
God damn this place.

341
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,200
I was about to leave.

342
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,240
- What is it?
- That owl of a mayor.

343
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,080
He has another renter.

344
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,620
He takes 40 pennies, and
he's got a room locked up.

345
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,280
Today he told me he wants to rent it.

346
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,380
What insolence.

347
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,040
And he threatened me.

348
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,770
Why did you stop visiting me?

349
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,320
You live far away.

350
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,570
The road is muddy, and dark at night.

351
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,720
- I travel enough by day.
- Hello.

352
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,520
Greetings, Aziz effendi.

353
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,930
Hello, Abbas effendi.

354
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,760
How are you?

355
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,280
See how he greets me?

356
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,970
Put in a good word in for me.

357
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,260
I will.

358
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,580
Be nice to Faltas effendi,
he's quite the fellow.

359
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,380
What is it now?

360
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,890
Why are you always after me?

361
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,720
I don't gamble, and I don't drink.

362
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,340
I only drink coffee and tea.

363
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,160
I am no good for you.

364
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:05,850
Give it up.

365
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,920
You do not do me justice at all.

366
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,090
I will not force you into anything.

367
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,050
In any case, you are welcome
to my place whenever you want.

368
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,600
Look there.

369
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,740
Here he is.

370
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,020
Eyes and ears wide open.

371
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,840
He wishes I'd stop by your place.

372
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,300
I'll drink, and gamble,
and he'll report me.

373
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,490
He wants me gone.

374
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,888
The mayor's relative, and
the village's private detective.

375
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,640
You're exaggerating.

376
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,780
You should relax. You're paranoid.

377
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,320
Loosen up.

378
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,060
I'll give you a good gift.

379
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,320
A piece of cloth, to make a gown from.

380
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,820
- Better than this stifling suit.
- A gown?

381
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,980
Me, in a gown?

382
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,050
You want to put me in a gown?

383
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,450
Like them?

384
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,060
Never mind him.

385
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,920
He's arrogant.

386
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,810
Only time will humble him.

387
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,380
- Humble me?
- I'm done here. I am leaving.

388
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,840
Humble me, you ignorant beast?

389
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,730
That will never happen.

390
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,760
By god, I will tame this place.

391
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,900
Take this, you might need this.

392
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,260
You're in quite a critical state.

393
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,360
Today, we go to the park.

394
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,340
We will study outdoors.

395
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,480
- Understood?
- Understood, mister Carter.

396
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,120
I want order.

397
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
Attention.

398
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,540
What's wrong, Jamilah?

399
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,000
Are you sad you're going back home?

400
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,460
Rejoice, vacation is near.

401
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,380
Sometimes you're heartless.

402
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:27,200
- I will miss you so much.
- You must come and visit me in Nekhilah.

403
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,220
How about it?

404
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,370
Father will say no.

405
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,400
Don't you have an aunt in our town?

406
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,120
Yes, but I can't visit her on my own.

407
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,460
- Either mother or father must come.
- So, you won't visit?

408
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,160
I don't have relatives in your village.

409
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,840
There's only a distant
relative, called Faltas.

410
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,290
We are not close.

411
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,360
Abbas Effendi, happy holidays.
I will see you soon.

412
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,130
Must you leave? I was hoping you'd stay.

413
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:59,680
- I need someone to talk to.
- Why don't you go visit your folks?

414
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,170
I wish I could, but I can't.
It would cost 3 pounds.

415
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,600
I don't have it.

416
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,980
It's going to be a bad break.

417
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,720
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

418
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,500
Daughter.

419
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,016
Hello.

420
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,800
Welcome back, dear.

421
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,650
You've changed a lot.

422
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,380
She looks so pretty. Look at her hairdo.

423
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:28,180
- Did you cut it?
- No, I just braided it.

424
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,460
Everyone does it in Asyut.

425
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,140
Why have you lost weight?

426
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,900
Mariam.

427
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,090
Make her some chicken.

428
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,940
- Yes, mam.
- Listen...

429
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,660
Go to your room and rest a while.

430
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:44,100
I will join you soon.

431
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,680
- I want to hear all about school.
- Yes, mother.

432
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,410
How are you?

433
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,480
Hello, sir.

434
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,770
No, sir. Please, don't.

435
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,930
Please, spare me.

436
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,640
Don't be scared.

437
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,490
I want to visit Nekhilah.

438
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:56,500
- Hush now, don't talk nonsense.
- I miss my aunt, I want to see her.

439
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:00,730
I said hush, I don't want to discuss it.

440
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,520
I will ask father to take me with him.

441
00:38:05,644 --> 00:38:06,866
Your father?

442
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,570
- Welcome back, daughter.
- Thank you, father.

443
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,080
- Father...
- Yes?

444
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,050
I want to visit my aunt in Nekhilah.

445
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,880
You just came back home.

446
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,340
You haven't been here a day.

447
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,120
Please, father.

448
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:47,960
I miss her so much. Plus,
it's the holidays.

449
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:57,920
When I travel to Asyut, I'll
drop you off in Nekhilah.

450
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,050
Thank you, father.

451
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,810
Happy holidays indeed.

452
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,740
Where are you from?

453
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,730
From around here.

454
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,930
- And where are you from?
- Cairo.

455
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,720
The center of the world.

456
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,300
I want to talk to you.

457
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,220
Talk to me?

458
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,140
- Talk about what?
- Many things.

459
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:02,770
How about it?

460
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,770
Where do you live?

461
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,690
In the mayor's old home.

462
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,360
That little man was right.

463
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,660
It came in handy.

464
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,020
Girl, you're good.

465
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,080
Better than Badia Masabni.

466
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,940
I can't believe my eyes.

467
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,180
Tell me, have you ever seen Badia dance?

468
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,040
And how?

469
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,520
Le me tell you.

470
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,370
We used to go every month...

471
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:10,330
my friends and I...
We'd spend the whole night.

472
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,900
God. Those were good times.

473
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:18,820
The music... The dance... The wine...

474
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,730
and the people.

475
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,130
Not like this hellhole here.

476
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,090
Those were the days. You
shouldn't remind me of them.

477
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,130
Tell me...

478
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,130
Do you miss Cairo?

479
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,340
Do I miss it?

480
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,330
I long for it, I burn for it.

481
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,040
Come here.

482
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:54,460
Why don't you come here?

483
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,480
Am I awake or dreaming?

484
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:22,340
This city man has come here to soil us.
Are we going to stand for it?

485
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,530
The postmaster is a bastard.

486
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,020
He has a woman with him in there.

487
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,620
Is that right?

488
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:32,130
My god.

489
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,760
Get out, woman.

490
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,520
- You can't do this in the mayor's home.
- You shut up, you senile idiot.

491
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,800
Show me some respect.

492
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,940
Take your men and leave now.

493
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,940
I have no women here.

494
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,640
No. There are women.

495
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,490
So be it. I do as I please.

496
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:01,200
You better mend your
ways before the mayor hears about this.

497
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,290
Are you threatening me?

498
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,440
You can both go to hell.

499
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,960
Go tell him.

500
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:09,880
I won't open.
What are you going to do about it?

501
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,500
Calm down, effendi.

502
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,370
Let me leave. We'll meet later.

503
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:20,540
- Are you frightened? Stay here.
- They're unforgiving, effendi.

504
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,200
I know them well.

505
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:28,280
They'll wait until I come out.
And if I don't, they'll ruin me.

506
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,620
Why is your hair undone, woman?

507
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,720
What were you doing in there?

508
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,570
Will show us a good time too?

509
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,370
My house is near. Wanna come with me?

510
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,210
Is he better than us?

511
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,490
Did he pay you?

512
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,410
- Damn you.
- Let me touch this white marble.

513
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:44,370
God help me.

514
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,280
Are you Abbas effendi?

515
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:35,490
Yes, sir.

516
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,760
I am the police chief.

517
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,680
- Welcome.
- May I have a word?

518
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:43,330
Of course. Please come inside.

519
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:57,740
The mayor has reported you, and
demands you vacate his house.

520
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:03,770
<i>The deputy and other eye witnesses...</i>

521
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:07,730
<i>Caught him, red-handed,
during the holidays...</i>

522
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,020
<i>in the company of a woman of ill-repute...</i>

523
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,320
<i>and since... etc etc.</i>

524
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,080
- What do you think?
- Me?

525
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,880
I think that the mayor...

526
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:20,530
- is a greedy man, and a criminal.
- I sympathize with you.

527
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:26,180
- I know you have your issues.
- It's all because of the house.

528
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,360
An old house. A dump.

529
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,850
It is not worth a dime.

530
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:36,260
- Let's go and reconcile you.
- Me, go there?

531
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,490
That criminal?

532
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,530
He should be the mayor of cattle...

533
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,360
- not people.
- Mister postmaster...

534
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,940
Put this in my account.

535
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,080
Still saving up money, are you?

536
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:53,280
- Why don't you spend it instead?
- I am not doing anything illegal.

537
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,280
Here's 10 pennies.

538
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:01,610
Don't follow your family's desires;
It will ruin you. How much is it now?

539
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,200
Almost there.

540
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,060
He is starving himself to save.

541
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,570
You know why?

542
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,250
To buy a gun and avenge his father.

543
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,970
Everyone knows.

544
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:13,780
Even the dead know.

545
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:16,660
Goodbye.

546
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,980
- And you do nothing?
- What can we do?

547
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:26,480
This crime of revenge will happen, just
like thousands before it.

548
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,840
And I'll question, and investigate...

549
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:33,330
and even the dead man's family
will cover for the murderer.

550
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:35,400
They'll avenge him themselves.

551
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,970
A vicious circle of ignorance.

552
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,800
There is nothing to do.

553
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,520
They're not to blame;
They live in the dark.

554
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:46,690
Ever since I came here...

555
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,640
- I can't stand it.
- I tried hard to get transferred.

556
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,930
Petitions, and letters...

557
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,160
I was just like you.

558
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,160
But the days passed.

559
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,280
I have been here 6 years.

560
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:03,140
I forced myself to be content.

561
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,940
And little by little...

562
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,570
I got to recognize the good in the bad.

563
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,700
One must not...

564
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:12,300
wallow in anger and despair forever.

565
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,450
Send my lunch over.

566
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,560
I will stay there.

567
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:32,100
Yes.

568
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,410
- Good morning, aunt.
- Good morning, dear.

569
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,140
Aren't we going?

570
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,820
Be reasonable, dear.

571
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,060
Your father would not approve.

572
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,280
He said you should stay home.

573
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:57,330
But it's a short trip,
and you're coming with me.

574
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,730
- I can't go out either.
- Please aunt, I beg you.

575
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,450
Sheir is my best friend.

576
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,610
We go to school together.

577
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,620
You'll meet her mother.

578
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:12,040
- Stop badgering me.
- Please aunt, say yes.

579
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,920
Uncle won't be back until nightfall.
He's busy.

580
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,440
Sit down.

581
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:19,200
After I deliver his lunch...

582
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:24,160
- We'll go together to meet your friend.
- Thank you, aunt.

583
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:11,770
- Welcome.
- Thank you for having us.

584
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:15,240
- Is this your school friend?
- Yes, mother.

585
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:19,060
And I'm the aunt she dragged with her.

586
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,940
We are honored by your visit.

587
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,740
I've heard so much about you.

588
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:28,340
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

589
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:33,820
- I've been bedridden so long.
- You must stay strong.

590
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:35,540
God willing.

591
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,010
Welcome to Nekhilah, Jamilah.

592
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,850
Thank you, mam.

593
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:43,170
Sheir holds you in such high esteem.

594
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,860
- I'll show Jamilah the garden.
- Don't be late.

595
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,280
Of course.

596
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,920
God bless them.

597
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,370
Sheir is a good girl.

598
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,000
I'm in Nekhilah.

599
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,480
I can't believe it.

600
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,120
I'm so happy.

601
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:16,250
So very happy.

602
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,820
Let's talk.

603
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,330
I feel like flying.

604
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:34,370
My heart is beating so fast. Feel it.

605
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,660
It's going to burst.

606
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:25,250
- I thought you were never coming.
- It was hard.

607
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:28,890
I had to pester my aunt for a long time.

608
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:33,810
- She finally said yes.
- Good girl. I'll show you the ruins.

609
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,130
- Will we be late?
- No. Let's go.

610
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:47,730
You stay here and wait for me, got it?

611
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:40,240
You scared us. What are you doing here?

612
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,860
- I've come looking for you.
- Looking for me, or for someone else?

613
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:46,930
How are you, Jamilah?

614
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,860
Welcome to Nekhilah.

615
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,420
Thank you.

616
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,880
Did you tour the ruins?

617
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,970
- It's just rocks. I don't get it.
- It used to be huge castle.

618
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:03,370
Shall I tell you the story?

619
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,140
- This was a castle?
- Yes.

620
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:14,240
About 2 acres. A long time ago.

621
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,900
Before the demons took over.

622
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:21,040
Stop teasing.

623
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:22,690
I tell the truth.

624
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:25,920
Jamilah, are you scared?

625
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,400
Don't be scared.

626
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:30,650
I'll protect you.

627
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:32,650
Tell us the story.

628
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,250
It was a huge castle.

629
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,170
The king had a daughter...

630
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,580
who was beautiful...

631
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:46,610
All the princes wanted her hand.

632
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,610
But the king said no.

633
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:51,490
He wanted to marry her to another king.

634
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:55,880
But the daughter fell in
love with a servant.

635
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,100
The king found out.

636
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:01,140
He built this castle.

637
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,450
It was secluded and well guarded.

638
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,200
She was held prisoner in here.

639
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:10,130
The castle was full of gold, and jewels...

640
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,930
and other wonders.

641
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,460
But all she wanted was her love.

642
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:19,240
She would write to him, on stones.

643
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:24,100
- Are you fooling us?
- Don't believe me? I'll show you.

644
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:28,490
Come.

645
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,660
- Should I read it?
- That's a letter?

646
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:34,960
- It's a drawing.
- Yes, silly. They used drawings.

647
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,730
And then what?

648
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:37,930
Finish the story.

649
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,930
What happened to her?

650
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,530
Her?

651
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:45,410
Yes.

652
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,820
She wrote many letters.

653
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:49,260
And then...

654
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,520
they eloped.

655
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:54,050
- They traveled to another kingdom.
- What's wrong?

656
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,880
What can I say?

657
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,810
- You want to talk in English?
- Yes, teach us.

658
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,690
Khalil speaks English very well.

659
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,090
Show her your pen.

660
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:10,640
Mister Carter gave it to him...

661
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,770
because he speaks English so well.

662
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,460
Naughty girl.

663
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,380
Show me.

664
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:27,770
What are doing after graduation?

665
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:29,320
Find a job.

666
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:32,780
A job where?

667
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:34,480
I don't know.

668
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,290
My brother-in-law will help me find one.

669
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,120
I already wrote him.

670
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,340
He lives in Alexandria.

671
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:46,720
- You'll move there?
- Yes.

672
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,450
<i>And they traveled to another kingdom...</i>

673
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:02,530
- But it is so far away.
- Yes, it is.

674
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,690
But it is a beautiful place.

675
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:09,555
Don't you want to stay here
and take care of your land?

676
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:12,250
I didn't study to be a peasant.

677
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,400
I want to travel and
live in the big cities.

678
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,340
Why so sad, Jamilah?

679
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,020
What to say?

680
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:24,200
Let's play hide-and-seek.

681
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:25,760
Yes, let's do it.

682
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:37,740
I'll count.

683
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,120
<i>And they traveled to another kingdom...</i>

684
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:04,760
- I've been waiting for hours.
- Here we are.

685
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:07,450
- Is the boss here?
- No, in Nekhilah.

686
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,420
- I wanted to discuss it with him.
- What's there to discuss?

687
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:14,820
Get to the point.

688
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,240
Say what's on your mind.

689
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,700
We want to know who it was.

690
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,040
I don't know, and I don't want
to involve my husband in this.

691
01:05:24,810 --> 01:05:26,360
- Fine.
- Call her.

692
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:28,290
Listen.

693
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:31,620
You take her and deal with her elsewhere.

694
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:33,540
Use your judgment.

695
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,570
Do what is best for your name.

696
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:38,050
Yes?

697
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,320
Yes.

698
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:43,850
Mariam.

699
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:45,940
Your folks are here.

700
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:50,160
Your brother and uncle.

701
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:53,600
Are you going to make them wait?

702
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,660
Uncle? Brother?

703
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:02,840
- Welcome.
- We've missed you a lot.

704
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:06,040
You're coming to Luxor with us.

705
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:08,360
Why? What happened?

706
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,780
People have been talking.

707
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,250
Serious things.

708
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,240
I am innocent. Have mercy.

709
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,210
Why are you crying?

710
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:25,220
- It is too late now.
- God damn you. You know I'm innocent.

711
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:10,960
Dear me, Khalil...

712
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,770
- What are you doing?
- I must talk to you.

713
01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:17,330
- I travel tomorrow.
- Travel?

714
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:20,940
- Travel where?
- Alexandria.

715
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,650
My brother-in-law wrote back.
He said to come.

716
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,980
I want to see you. Can I come up?

717
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:30,980
No, please don't.

718
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,610
Stay there.

719
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,440
I'll come down.

720
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,970
Are you leaving me?

721
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,500
Don't leave me, I beg you.

722
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,500
Don't be silly.

723
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:27,020
You're always in my heart.

724
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:28,770
I won't be long.

725
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:33,000
After my first paycheck, I'll
come and ask for your hand.

726
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,980
I'm in your hands...

727
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:38,180
to do as you please.

728
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:40,800
Are you scared?

729
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,010
No, but I don't know how I'll wait.

730
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,520
Whenever you think of
me, write me a letter.

731
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:56,800
Here's the address. Save it.

732
01:08:58,120 --> 01:08:59,460
Write me every day.

733
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,570
And when I get there, I'll write to you.

734
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:07,580
Why did you rip it?

735
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,800
I will never forget it. Don't worry.

736
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:22,330
- Welcome. We've not seen you around.
- I have not been feeling good.

737
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,020
I didn't go to work.

738
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,280
- Honestly, I am fed up.
- By the way...

739
01:09:27,650 --> 01:09:29,400
You got a package by train.

740
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:30,960
What package?

741
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:33,930
It must be some magazines I ordered.

742
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:35,860
I was expecting them.

743
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,970
Your mail doesn't go
through the post office.

744
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,860
Better by train than through the post.

745
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:46,540
Excuse me.

746
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:48,170
- Take care.
- Goodbye.

747
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,850
I'll see you all later, at home.

748
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:42,240
Instead of staring, make me some tea.

749
01:10:55,010 --> 01:10:57,570
Any mail for 'Awaden Mahrous?

750
01:10:58,210 --> 01:10:59,690
- Is that you?
- No.

751
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:02,180
- Where is he?
- Don't know.

752
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:04,480
Animals...

753
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:28,530
Here.

754
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:38,360
Listen, I'm out delivering mail.
You stay here.

755
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:16,140
Come see. See what has become of us.

756
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:20,810
I'll show you. Come.

757
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,360
What is it?

758
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:45,020
This is a real woman, you mules.

759
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:48,560
My god.

760
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:52,800
By god, those we married are not women.

761
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:04,860
Unbelievable.

762
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:08,440
Where are their gowns?

763
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:22,730
- It must be drawings.
- Drawings, you idiots?

764
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:28,890
They're photographs, like in
posters in the town hall.

765
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:31,660
They're not like these pictures.

766
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:35,460
This is something else.

767
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:38,660
Abbas effendi is a sly fox.

768
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:43,900
He knows these women.

769
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,400
They send him pictures.

770
01:13:47,250 --> 01:13:50,500
He'll send word for the one he likes.

771
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:52,820
Yes.

772
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:58,850
These women are coming here?

773
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,500
Yes.

774
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,610
Ever since the dancer incident...

775
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:10,690
he's changed.

776
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,840
I<i> tried my best to make a
drawing of my heart...</i>

777
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,950
<i>with a picture of you inside.</i>

778
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:57,480
<i>I am back home, but you're still
in my heart. I miss you, my love.</i>

779
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:02,880
<i>Once you receive this letter, please
write me to Oum Ahmad's address.</i>

780
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:05,420
<i>I've attached the address.</i>

781
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:11,060
<i>Everyone knows Oum Ahmad here.
She'll help us.</i>

782
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:16,150
<i>Rest assured she'll deliver your letters.</i>

783
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:18,930
- <i>She can keep a secret..</i>.
- Tell me, aunt.

784
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:22,130
- What is Jamilah doing?
- She's upstairs.

785
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:25,310
I will go and check on her.

786
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,310
Fine.

787
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:43,910
Do you want to see my fabrics?
They're beautiful.

788
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:47,370
Here's the letter. Please mail it soon.

789
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:50,080
Please don't tell anyone.

790
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,930
I beg you.

791
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:55,880
Silly girl. Your secret is safe with me.

792
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:19,200
Come here.

793
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:27,240
- Deliver this to the train.
- Yes.

794
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:28,660
Go.

795
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:32,800
And don't ride the donkey.

796
01:16:37,310 --> 01:16:39,020
Out of here, scum.

797
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:00,460
How are you, Abbas effendi?

798
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:02,220
I feel like garbage.

799
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:04,150
Here I come.

800
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:11,710
What's wrong?

801
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:16,200
There is not one person I can talk to.

802
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,310
Not even to joke with.

803
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,710
It's awful.

804
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:24,000
All the town's secrets are with you.

805
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:28,620
Its coming and goings are
all in these letters.

806
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:31,750
Comings and goings?

807
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,110
These were not written by humans.

808
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,370
I think that these people...

809
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:41,370
aren't humans.

810
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:44,930
You know, I envy you.

811
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:47,910
You work far away.

812
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:50,570
Take it easy. Calm down.

813
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:54,770
It's just like other towns.
They'll all backward.

814
01:17:55,570 --> 01:17:58,040
I need to catch the train.

815
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,680
Goodbye.

816
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:13,130
Here are the vaunted letters.

817
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,280
Same old stories.

818
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:20,600
Never ending drudgery.

819
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,550
A pile of disgusting
missives, coming and going.

820
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:29,220
<i>Cairo to Kom El Nahl...</i>

821
01:18:30,370 --> 01:18:31,910
<i>Kom El Nahl to Mahatta...</i>

822
01:18:32,930 --> 01:18:37,000
<i>To be delivered by hand to recipient...</i>

823
01:18:37,970 --> 01:18:40,310
<i>Urgent, urgent, urgent...</i>

824
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,350
You stamp it...

825
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,040
throw it in a bag, then the train...

826
01:18:46,750 --> 01:18:50,420
Two days later, you get the answer.

827
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:00,860
You will end me with your hands.

828
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:05,150
You will mock me to my grave.

829
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:10,710
I want to know how you live.

830
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,640
What goes on in your skulls?

831
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:16,260
Comings... Goings...

832
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,060
You sons of...

833
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:24,240
I got you now.

834
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:29,570
From now on, I'm watching you.

835
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,080
I'll crawl under your skins.

836
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:37,150
<i>What's wrong with him? He must
come in person to take his wife...</i>

837
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:39,370
<i>It's shameful.</i>

838
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,200
<i>We resolved the problem...</i>

839
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:46,820
<i>We inspected the well on Wednesday...</i>

840
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:50,860
<i>All was good at the end...</i>

841
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:54,080
<i>Another pound, that makes six...</i>

842
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:56,550
<i>Your mother is coming...</i>

843
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:02,680
<i>Fatma, once you receive the
money, open an account...</i>

844
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:06,770
<i>Save some aside...</i>

845
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:12,600
<i>Send my greetings to all the relatives...</i>

846
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:16,220
<i>When I come back, you better not...</i>

847
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:21,080
<i>The buffalo costs two pounds to feed...</i>

848
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:25,440
<i>I will only pay one
pound, and that's all...</i>

849
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:27,330
Nothing for me today?

850
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:32,130
Why are you angry? What have I done?

851
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:34,750
Name?

852
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,710
Your servant, Oum Ahmad.

853
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:10,860
Nothing today.

854
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:13,200
Try again tomorrow.

855
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:15,460
Yes, I will try tomorrow.

856
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:20,200
God bless you, and help
you, and smile upon you.

857
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,970
<i>Hello my love...</i>

858
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:09,150
<i>My warmest kisses and passion to you...</i>

859
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,170
This old hag...

860
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:16,130
still gets kisses? And passion?

861
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,910
<i>My love, I must tell you that...</i>

862
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:26,570
<i>I am sorry I haven't written in a while...</i>

863
01:22:27,460 --> 01:22:30,260
<i>I have been so busy...</i>

864
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:32,860
<i>I think of you night and day...</i>

865
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:38,620
<i>The position that my
brother-in-law promised me...</i>

866
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:40,620
<i>is on hold.</i>

867
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,710
<i>I was in despair...</i>

868
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:46,600
<i>I did not want to burden you with this.</i>

869
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,840
<i>But I have found...</i>

870
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:53,970
<i>another position in Cairo...</i>

871
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:57,040
<i>I will start soon, god willing.</i>

872
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:00,620
<i>Therefore, my love...</i>

873
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:03,800
<i>my darling, my sun...</i>

874
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:06,420
<i>do not write to this address anymore...</i>

875
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:13,150
<i>as I am traveling today to Cairo.</i>

876
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:17,860
<i>I have so much more to tell you...</i>

877
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:21,680
<i>once I get settled in Cairo...</i>

878
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:26,020
<i>I await your reply with
burning impatience...</i>

879
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:31,480
<i>Please write to me to
this temporary address...</i>

880
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:36,260
<i>Khalil Effendi Saad...</i>

881
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:47,880
Impossible. It can't be.

882
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:51,350
There's a secret.

883
01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:00,040
Is this Oum Ahmad...

884
01:24:00,820 --> 01:24:03,510
moonlighting as a postwoman?

885
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,840
She's delivering letters.

886
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:10,640
- You little...
- Hello, sir.

887
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:12,800
Anything today?

888
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,460
Hello. Just in time.

889
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:32,970
You have one letter.

890
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,970
- Sign here.
- I need a favor.

891
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:42,880
I forgot my stamp. Can
I use my fingerprint?

892
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,400
Sure. Just for you.

893
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:51,150
Don't forget it again.

894
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,770
<i>My guardian angel...</i>

895
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:23,840
<i>I received the letter I have been
waiting for so feverishly...</i>

896
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:25,840
<i>My love...</i>

897
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,710
<i>Ever since we left Nekhilah,
my soul is with you...</i>

898
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:35,440
<i>I am so happy that you found a job...</i>

899
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,510
<i>I pray to god to keep you safe.</i>

900
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:42,640
<i>My love...</i>

901
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:46,460
<i>My sister has visited me...</i>

902
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,040
<i>Mother could not come...</i>

903
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:52,570
<i>We went to the zoo...</i>

904
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:57,000
<i>We saw the lion, and the tiger, and
the elephant. She was very pleased.</i>

905
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:02,060
<i>How I wish you were here with me.</i>

906
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:06,860
<i>My love, I write to you everyday...</i>

907
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:09,370
<i>All I do is think of you...</i>

908
01:26:09,930 --> 01:26:11,950
<i>You write every fortnight.</i>

909
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:14,000
<i>I suffer while I wait...</i>

910
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:17,150
<i>My love, have you forgotten me?</i>

911
01:26:17,530 --> 01:26:19,330
<i>Has Cairo made you forget me?</i>

912
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:23,020
<i>If you love me, write me more often.</i>

913
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:25,530
<i>My dearest love...</i>

914
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,310
<i>How can you say I forgot you?</i>

915
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:33,640
<i>I have good news for you.</i>

916
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:37,040
<i>I am coming to you soon.</i>

917
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:43,080
<i>I will come to your home and
ask for your hand in marriage.</i>

918
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:47,170
Mother, I can't believe it. I can't wait.

919
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:51,440
Let's see what your father thinks.

920
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:53,130
Please god...

921
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:14,530
Welcome.

922
01:27:15,930 --> 01:27:19,420
- You honor my house.
- The honor is ours.

923
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:23,350
- Please rest.
- Here you go.

924
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:24,820
Thank you.

925
01:27:25,770 --> 01:27:31,840
- Khalil wants to discuss a matter.
- Welcome, mister Khalil.

926
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:34,350
- Please.
- Thank you.

927
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:41,730
Speak, man.

928
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:46,240
Don't be bashful. Fine, I'll speak.

929
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:50,510
Mister Khalil wants to get married.

930
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:54,660
- He asks for your daughter's hand.
- I'm honored.

931
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:00,310
- Tell me about yourself.
- Mister Khalil...

932
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:04,260
is the son of Saad Abou Ragheb...

933
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:07,950
god rest his soul, from Nekhilah.

934
01:28:08,570 --> 01:28:09,950
You must know him.

935
01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:15,820
He and his sister own land there.

936
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:18,880
And what's more, he works in Cairo.

937
01:28:19,150 --> 01:28:21,530
- You said Nekhilah?
- Yes, sir.

938
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:26,330
My mother is sorry she couldn't make it.

939
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:30,420
- She is ill.
- I understand.

940
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:33,080
My uncle represents her.

941
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:35,930
Khalil is family to me.

942
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,400
His late father...

943
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:40,730
was my father's cousin.

944
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:44,530
- Welcome.
- Thank you, sir.

945
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:48,930
- We're going to be relatives.
- Slow down a little.

946
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:52,350
- So you're from Nekhilah?
- Yes, sir.

947
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:55,400
My sister is Jamilah's friend.

948
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:59,640
- They're in the same class.
- You know her name?

949
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:03,570
Did she visit you?

950
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:06,660
Yes, she visited my sister once.

951
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:11,950
- So it's like that.
- What do you say, sir? Do you agree?

952
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:15,110
I think it's too early for this.

953
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,620
She's still too young.

954
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,620
- But...
- Later.

955
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:25,820
We'll talk later, when she
finishes her studies.

956
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:30,280
- But that will take years.
- So what?

957
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,770
You must be reasonable.

958
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:38,220
- We might not come back.
- As you wish.

959
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,480
She won't marry.

960
01:29:43,420 --> 01:29:45,020
As you wish, sir.

961
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:47,840
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

962
01:29:50,680 --> 01:29:52,800
You say she was in Nekhilah?

963
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:55,310
And you know her name, too?

964
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:57,770
Yes, sir.

965
01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:03,840
Men coming. This way.

966
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:12,110
Goodbye.

967
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:21,820
Why did he change his mind?

968
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:27,000
What a mule. I told you not to bother.

969
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:32,170
What are you doing? He might see you.

970
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:39,200
He knows you? You're
friends with his sister?

971
01:30:39,930 --> 01:30:42,970
Where did you meet? Speak.

972
01:30:43,530 --> 01:30:46,910
You bring me shame and dishonor.

973
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:50,460
I've deprived you of nothing.

974
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,150
Is this how you pay me back?

975
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:56,840
You think you're so smart?

976
01:30:57,150 --> 01:31:00,440
You see him behind my back?

977
01:31:00,730 --> 01:31:06,130
From now on, no school for you.
You stay home.

978
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:15,200
He said no, mother. He said no.

979
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,330
Woe is me.

980
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:20,640
I am ruined, as good as dead.

981
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:24,130
Why did he say no? What's
wrong with Khalil?

982
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,130
Daughter.

983
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:27,910
What is it?

984
01:31:28,510 --> 01:31:31,350
Mother, you must help me.

985
01:31:33,060 --> 01:31:34,570
I beg you.

986
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:37,220
What have you done?

987
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:39,970
What a disaster.

988
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:44,080
God help us. A scandal.

989
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:48,750
- Help me. Convince father.
- Convince him?

990
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:52,110
Him, break his word? After all this?

991
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,280
You know how he is.

992
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:01,280
I will marry her, despite his wishes.

993
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:04,800
- You'll see. I'll do it.
- As you wish.

994
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:06,860
It will be hard.

995
01:32:07,710 --> 01:32:11,820
<i>My love, I have not heard
from you in so long...</i>

996
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:16,110
<i>If only you knew... I
am a captive in my house...</i>

997
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:18,910
<i>I'm so distraught, I can't sleep...</i>

998
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,170
<i>It's starting to show...</i>

999
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:23,840
<i>My mother found out...</i>

1000
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:25,260
Oh no.

1001
01:32:26,260 --> 01:32:27,510
I should go early.

1002
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:31,110
I must mail her letter by nine.

1003
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:33,040
This is serious.

1004
01:32:36,170 --> 01:32:38,710
<i>Since you left, I'm hiding in my room...</i>

1005
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:41,280
<i>hoping father does not notice.</i>

1006
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:47,310
<i>Time is passing, my belly is
growing, and he will soon find out.</i>

1007
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:50,550
<i>Please find a way, I beg you.</i>

1008
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:52,770
<i>Take me from this place...</i>

1009
01:32:53,370 --> 01:32:55,770
<i>I'll be forever grateful.</i>

1010
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:58,710
<i>I can no longer hide...</i>

1011
01:32:59,130 --> 01:33:00,480
You idiots.

1012
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,530
What have you done?

1013
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:04,770
When did it happen?

1014
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,310
Once he finds out...

1015
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:09,080
he'll find a way.

1016
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:13,240
Take these to the train.

1017
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:17,310
But I just came back. Why not wait?

1018
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:19,930
I said now. Move it.

1019
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,370
Good. It will make it.

1020
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:31,350
Unless the idiot goes elsewhere.

1021
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:06,660
<i>Dearest angel...</i>

1022
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:11,220
<i>I am in agony over my
encounter with your father.</i>

1023
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:16,040
<i>I have received a message
from my brother-in-law...</i>

1024
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:19,150
<i>saying that the original job is ready.</i>

1025
01:34:19,710 --> 01:34:20,880
<i>I was very happy.</i>

1026
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,260
<i>I was busy moving.</i>

1027
01:34:24,020 --> 01:34:26,420
<i>That is why I have not written yet.</i>

1028
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:29,930
<i>I am sorry I have neglected you.</i>

1029
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:35,200
<i>I am writing you from Alexandria,
where I started my job.</i>

1030
01:34:36,150 --> 01:34:41,620
<i>Please write me to my Alexandria address.</i>

1031
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:46,220
He is no longer in Cairo.

1032
01:34:47,660 --> 01:34:49,240
He won't get her letter.

1033
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:57,840
<i>As for the marriage, rest
assured that I will find a way.</i>

1034
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:00,950
<i>I can't picture us apart.</i>

1035
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:05,480
<i>I am looking for an apartment for us.</i>

1036
01:35:05,970 --> 01:35:08,280
<i>I will write in more detail soon.</i>

1037
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:10,840
<i>If your father persists...</i>

1038
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:15,460
<i>you should elope, and we'll get married.</i>

1039
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:21,000
<i>If you agree, please write me.</i>

1040
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:26,460
<i>Finally, my warmest kisses to you.</i>

1041
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:29,910
God help them.

1042
01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:32,570
Poor creatures.

1043
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:35,020
He knows she's suffering.

1044
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:51,170
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1045
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,440
- How much this time?
- No.

1046
01:35:54,170 --> 01:35:56,550
- I want my money.
- Why?

1047
01:35:56,950 --> 01:35:59,950
- Changed your mind about the gun?
- Stay out of it.

1048
01:36:00,640 --> 01:36:05,060
- I want my 10 pounds and 80 pennies now.
- You can't have it.

1049
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:10,880
- It has to go through the main office.
- What main office?

1050
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:16,060
- The office in Cairo, my friend.
- I do not care.

1051
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:20,820
- I want my money.
- Didn't you understand?

1052
01:36:22,330 --> 01:36:25,480
- Hello, mister postmaster.
- Hello.

1053
01:36:25,770 --> 01:36:29,370
- I need a word with you.
- What is it?

1054
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:34,040
- The mayor wants you to leave his home.
- Again?

1055
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:37,910
Always the house. Won't you quit?

1056
01:36:38,510 --> 01:36:40,420
I swear to god...

1057
01:36:41,110 --> 01:36:44,840
and to you, and the mayor,
and this hell hole...

1058
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,840
I am not leaving. Got it?

1059
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:50,020
Don't come here again.

1060
01:36:50,550 --> 01:36:54,000
Scram and go tell your mayor.

1061
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,620
Is that so? Me, scram?

1062
01:36:59,170 --> 01:37:01,910
- We'll see.
- Mister deputy.

1063
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:05,350
- Please help me.
- You scram too.

1064
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:09,170
I'm going to report you to the mayor.

1065
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:12,880
Wait, deputy. I'm coming with you.

1066
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,370
Unbelievable.

1067
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:19,860
What's this?

1068
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,170
I knew something bad was going to happen.

1069
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,330
What to do?

1070
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:34,130
It's tainted. I can't deliver it.

1071
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:42,330
It's hopeless.

1072
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:46,770
She won't know he's in Alexandria.

1073
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:53,260
So what? They're in love...

1074
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:55,550
They'll find a way.

1075
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,800
But she's pregnant.

1076
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:12,130
He'll write another letter.

1077
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,550
He will surely write again.

1078
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:35,440
Nothing.

1079
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:40,420
- Maybe this evening.
- Thank you. I will try this evening.

1080
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,530
God help them.

1081
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:47,440
I should have stayed out of this.

1082
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:53,080
- Why did I interfere?
- To the station, I'll follow you.

1083
01:39:02,240 --> 01:39:04,910
- Yes?
- How's your daughter?

1084
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:09,000
- She's in bed. She's feeling better.
- I am traveling.

1085
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:12,530
If she steps out of the house...

1086
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:15,600
- I'll cut both your throats.
- You know, dear...

1087
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:21,170
mister Khalil is from a good
family, and he has a good job.

1088
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:22,950
I don't want to hear this.

1089
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:29,310
God help us all.

1090
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,080
Who is it?

1091
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:25,930
It's Jamilah.

1092
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:32,020
Welcome. Come in.

1093
01:40:34,910 --> 01:40:36,620
Please come in.

1094
01:40:36,970 --> 01:40:37,970
Sit.

1095
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:42,310
- I'm sorry for the mess. I'm traveling.
- Traveling?

1096
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:46,040
For a little while. I
am going to a wedding.

1097
01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:48,510
My cousin's.

1098
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,400
I'll stay for a week.

1099
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:55,570
I know you're worried about the letters.

1100
01:40:56,680 --> 01:40:59,130
I check everyday.

1101
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:02,710
Honestly, dear...

1102
01:41:03,170 --> 01:41:05,150
I must tell you...

1103
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:08,460
I think he maybe got
discouraged by your father.

1104
01:41:10,570 --> 01:41:12,420
He hasn't written since.

1105
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:18,370
You're crying?

1106
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,750
Did something happen?

1107
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:23,910
It's like that?

1108
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:27,570
Why didn't you say anything?

1109
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:31,170
Please, tell me what to do.

1110
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Don't worry.

1111
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:35,550
I'll be away for a week.

1112
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:38,800
When I'm back, I'll help you fix this.

1113
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:01,440
He wrote again.

1114
01:42:03,750 --> 01:42:05,640
Oum Ahmad has not stopped by lately.

1115
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,840
Come here.

1116
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,260
Take this to Oum Ahmad.

1117
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:18,130
- Who?
- The old lady who dyes her hair red.

1118
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:21,150
I noticed that you are fond of her.

1119
01:42:22,220 --> 01:42:26,110
- You should stay away from such people.
- You shut up.

1120
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:29,660
- Deliver the letter.
- I don't deliver letters.

1121
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:31,840
She must pick it up herself.

1122
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:34,550
You know the rules.

1123
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:36,910
I'll be outside.

1124
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:40,080
Damn you.

1125
01:42:58,310 --> 01:43:01,110
<i>My dear, I can't bear our separation.</i>

1126
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:03,310
<i>I found an apartment.</i>

1127
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:07,060
<i>The view is breathtaking.</i>

1128
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:11,370
<i>I feverishly await your arrival.</i>

1129
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:16,040
<i>Or have you changed your mind?</i>

1130
01:43:16,770 --> 01:43:19,800
<i>I am surprised you haven't written.</i>

1131
01:43:20,420 --> 01:43:24,910
<i>I beg you, my darling,
to write to me again.</i>

1132
01:43:25,460 --> 01:43:27,440
<i>That will make me so happy.</i>

1133
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:33,620
<i>Tell me when you're coming, and I will
wait for you at the station.</i>

1134
01:43:36,150 --> 01:43:37,240
Great.

1135
01:43:37,950 --> 01:43:42,020
She'll find out he's back in Alexandria.

1136
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:46,110
Where's Oum Ahmad?

1137
01:44:00,770 --> 01:44:01,770
You there.

1138
01:44:02,730 --> 01:44:04,060
Go inside.

1139
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:07,570
- You'll delivering it?
- I said inside.

1140
01:44:08,640 --> 01:44:09,640
Where's Oum Ahmad?

1141
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:13,880
Where does she live?

1142
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:23,400
Do you know where Jamilah lives?

1143
01:44:30,530 --> 01:44:31,950
Where can she be?

1144
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,730
- I want to know.
- No.

1145
01:44:35,680 --> 01:44:37,400
Mister deputy, come here.

1146
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:39,330
You there.

1147
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:44,950
Take two policemen, and go
round up those girls.

1148
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:46,570
Deputy, come.

1149
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,570
He'll show you the way.

1150
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:01,350
Write this down:

1151
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:05,660
<i>On this date, etc...</i>

1152
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:10,880
<i>To the police commissioner:</i>

1153
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,000
<i>An employee at the post-office...</i>

1154
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:19,440
<i>informed me...</i>

1155
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,460
<i>that the postmaster, Abbas Hussein...</i>

1156
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:29,280
<i>assaulted a young girl
on her way to market.</i>

1157
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:32,460
<i>Moreover, the aforementioned...</i>

1158
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:39,000
<i>tried to assault another girl on the
same day, and she escaped.</i>

1159
01:45:39,750 --> 01:45:42,200
<i>This occurred on the main road.</i>

1160
01:45:43,530 --> 01:45:47,040
<i>Neither girl agreed to testify...</i>

1161
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:50,640
<i>for fear of gossip and scandal.</i>

1162
01:45:51,370 --> 01:45:55,930
<i>Signed by the mayor</i>. Hand
it over, I'll stamp it.

1163
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:00,170
I attacked you?

1164
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Speak.

1165
01:46:03,260 --> 01:46:04,260
You too.

1166
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:06,060
I'm going mad.

1167
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:09,240
I swear...

1168
01:46:09,570 --> 01:46:13,970
I swear I've never seen them before.

1169
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:18,770
- All this for a house?
- Calm down, please.

1170
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:23,310
Watch it. Your father is here.

1171
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:20,510
Mother, please help me.

1172
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:22,330
Oh god.

1173
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:26,330
Who's here? Darwish?

1174
01:47:27,370 --> 01:47:29,440
You're here? Thank you.

1175
01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:32,310
I've slept a lot.

1176
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:35,820
I have to go to work.

1177
01:47:36,910 --> 01:47:38,860
I have to see what happened.

1178
01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:41,970
If I hadn't interfered...

1179
01:47:42,770 --> 01:47:44,350
they'd be together.

1180
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:46,880
She'd be safe.

1181
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:49,730
I ruined them.

1182
01:47:50,680 --> 01:47:52,770
In Cairo, I wouldn't have cared.

1183
01:47:53,930 --> 01:47:55,730
But here, I fear for her.

1184
01:47:56,350 --> 01:47:57,350
They'll kill her.

1185
01:47:58,040 --> 01:47:59,040
They're animals.

1186
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:00,950
I know them.

1187
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:04,570
If only I could find her.

1188
01:48:05,660 --> 01:48:08,530
If something happens to
her, I'm responsible.

1189
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:12,220
I'd feel like I killed her myself.

1190
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,020
Please, I beg you, don't.

1191
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,530
<i>Khalil, save me.</i>

1192
01:50:51,530 --> 01:50:53,570
Khalil.

1193
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:54,710
<i>Tell me, Khalil.</i>

1194
01:52:55,370 --> 01:52:57,150
<i>What did the king's daughter do?</i>

1195
01:52:57,950 --> 01:52:59,150
<i>The daughter...</i>

1196
01:52:59,550 --> 01:53:00,840
<i>She eloped.</i>

1197
01:53:01,600 --> 01:53:03,420
<i>They went to another kingdom.</i>

1198
01:53:04,370 --> 01:53:05,950
<i>Another kingdom.</i>

1199
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:46,420
The End
