1
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,441
Herbie!

2
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:27,234
Come on, Herbie,
we better go.

3
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:31,629
Herbie! Coming, Mom!

4
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:34,545
Come on, we're late.

5
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,897
Ah! One hat
 at a time, Herbie.

6
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:40,943
Okay, Mom.

7
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:46,209
My name is Butch.
 Butch Cassidy, ma'am.

8
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:48,951
Yes, sir, Mr. Cassidy.

9
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,088
All right,
 Dad's here!

10
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:57,264
Oh, good,
 you're home early.

11
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:58,874
Oh!

12
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:01,398
Hey, big guy.

13
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:04,836
What are you two up to?

14
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,751
I'm taking Mr. Cassidy
 to the clinic.

15
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:08,188
Why don't you
 take me, Dad?

16
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,754
Then we can plan
 our trip to Wyoming.

17
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,626
Please! Hey, that's a great idea.

18
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:14,411
Herbie, I can't.

19
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:15,934
I just came home
 to pick up some papers

20
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:18,589
and I've got to shoot
right back down
to the office.

21
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,461
You never take me, Dad.

22
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:26,162
Hey, we'll play some
 ball after dinner.
 Promise, huh.

23
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,946
Come on, Herbie,
 get your bike.

24
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,339
Okay, Mom.

25
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:15,907
Herbie!

26
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:19,563
You brat!

27
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:21,609
I see you!

28
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:24,307
Women.

29
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:32,359
Hiya,
 giddy up there, hiya.

30
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,232
Whoo-hoo!

31
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,147
Hiya, pardner, Telford!

32
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:42,456
Hiya, pardner!
 How you doin'?

33
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:43,761
Herbie,
 get back in here.

34
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:45,154
Herbie?
 Herbie, careful.

35
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:46,938
Herbie! HERBIE: Yahoo!

36
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,679
Hey, you make every
 shot count now, huh?

37
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,551
Every shot count. HERBIE: Yahoo!

38
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:53,336
Hiya,
giddy up there. Hiya.

39
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,859
Whoo-hoo!

40
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:57,601
You make every shot
count now, huh?

41
00:04:57,645 --> 00:05:00,300
See you back
 at the ranch! Whoopee!

42
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,349
Would this
 go by the window?

43
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:07,829
Needs a lot of work.

44
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,831
I don't know,
 that's the charm of it.

45
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:12,529
You don't want
 to fancy it up too much.

46
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:14,923
How much
 for this icebox?

47
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:16,141
$600.

48
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,101
You're kidding.

49
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:21,495
I wouldn't kid
 about a thing
 like that.

50
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,366
Yeah, but it hasn't
 been restored. I mean...

51
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,020
Restored?

52
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:27,501
Restored to what?

53
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:29,154
Well, look at it.
Half the hardware
is missing.

54
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:31,331
Oh, hardware.

55
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,768
No buts about it,
 that's $600.

56
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:36,814
Look, there's a crack. Honey.

57
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:40,340
Right here,
 right through the door.

58
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:42,820
You probably want to put
 booze in this thing.
 Don't you?

59
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:46,911
Huh? Is that right?
Yeah. I thought so.

60
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:50,480
See, Mrs. Deerfield
 kept milk in here
 for her six kids.

61
00:05:50,524 --> 00:05:53,309
She didn't believe
in drinking.

62
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,877
How am I, in good conscience,
 going to sell you this icebox

63
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,532
knowing full well
you're going to fill it
with whiskey?

64
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,926
It ain't right.

65
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,580
She's dead, isn't she?

66
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:07,192
Not in my mind,
 she isn't.

67
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,412
Honey?

68
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,632
Come on, honey,
 let's get out of here.

69
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:20,728
He's strange. He's a bit weird.

70
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:25,167
How's business,
 Telford?

71
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,386
It's good, Lyles,
 real good.

72
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:27,604
Heard you sold something.

73
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:29,737
No, just a layaway.

74
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,308
Huh!

75
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,862
We're ready, Herbie.

76
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,699
Hi, Herbie.
 I'll be with you
 in a sec.

77
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:23,965
Butch.

78
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:26,794
Butch.

79
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,078
- Er, Herbie...
- I mean Butch.

80
00:07:51,296 --> 00:07:52,907
You can't 
wear that gun.

81
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:02,873
Er, Butch,
 the hat, too.

82
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,059
All right.

83
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:49,529
Now hold still, Herbie.

84
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,747
All right, don't
 wiggle your toes.

85
00:09:01,671 --> 00:09:03,020
Cassidy!

86
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:09,810
Herbie, put your head back.

87
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,031
Herbie, put
your head back.

88
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:21,952
Herbie, you've got 
to hold still.

89
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:33,485
Mrs. McGrath,
 if it looks like we've
 got it under control,

90
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,706
perhaps we can
 reduce the frequency
 of his visits here.

91
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,056
We'll just have
 to play it by ear.

92
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,928
Hi, honey.Hi.

93
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:43,800
Honey, if you feel
 all right,

94
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:44,714
why don't you
 get your bike out of
 the back of the car

95
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:46,150
and start your
 paper route?

96
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:47,804
I want to talk to
 the doctor for a minute.

97
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:49,023
Okay, Mom.

98
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,248
I... I know what
you're going through,
and I...

99
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,773
Well, I just don't have
 all the answers.

100
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:02,340
Some days he has
the energy
of two 11-year-olds

101
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,778
and other days
he can't even
get out of bed.

102
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:07,302
I know. I know.

103
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:08,259
Well, thank you,
 Dr. Garson.

104
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:10,131
You're welcome.

105
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:30,760
Darcy, check this out.

106
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:43,120
You're gonna get
 hurt if you keep
 showing off, Herbie.

107
00:10:43,164 --> 00:10:45,514
I wasn't showing off, Darcy.
 There was rattlesnakes
 everywhere.

108
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:46,994
Huh?

109
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:48,691
Yeah, they were
all the way up
to my handle bars.

110
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:50,040
One was even crawling up
my pant leg.

111
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,476
Ah!

112
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,175
Yeah. I had to squash him
 before he bit me.

113
00:10:54,218 --> 00:10:57,395
Oh, Herbie, you
 and your day dreams.

114
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,441
Come on, Darcy,
 let's go for a ride.

115
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,712
You know what, Darcy?What?

116
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,236
You're the
 prettiest girl
 on the block.

117
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:25,456
Herbie, I'm the only
girl on the block.

118
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,464
Whoopee!
 Pony express.

119
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,137
Watson, grab the phone.

120
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:01,884
Mr. Bell.

121
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,668
Mr. Bell, is that you?

122
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:06,497
Sure is.
 Watson, we're making history.

123
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,065
Pretty soon
we'll have all these
stupid sons of bitches

124
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,501
putting quarters
 in these boxes.

125
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:12,199
Dad!

126
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:14,984
Watch your language,
 he's just a child.

127
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:18,074
Hell, I learned
 to talk that way
 from the kid.

128
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:20,076
Didn't I, Butch?

129
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:24,689
Butch, isn't that right?

130
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,518
Well... Yeah!

131
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:32,001
It's the damn truth, ma'am.

132
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:34,874
My father
 has a lot of wonderful
 qualities, Herbie,

133
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,659
but language
 is not one of them.

134
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:39,748
Only ignorant
 people swear.

135
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,402
Wait a minute.

136
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,273
But...

137
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,623
It's me...
 It's my fault, ma'am.

138
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:48,148
Well, if you're going
 to be a bad influence
 on my father

139
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,932
maybe you better play
 someplace else.

140
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:54,458
I'm almost finished
 with the bookkeeping, Dad.

141
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:56,417
Hmm.

142
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,072
I'm afraid Jeff is going
 to have to check them
 over again.

143
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:08,472
All that just because
 the stupid sons...

144
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:11,475
Where's my paper?

145
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,476
I'll be right back.

146
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:25,620
Well... Here we are.

147
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:28,840
Let's see.

148
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,585
Ah, the Russians
 are at it again,
 look at that.

149
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:37,501
Wish to the devil
 George C. Scott
 was running things.

150
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,027
Uh-oh. Enemy.

151
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,942
Enemy! Lock the door.

152
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:46,510
Hmm.

153
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:55,693
Come on, Telford, open up.

154
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,914
Nancy!

155
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,568
Come on, Telford.

156
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,051
Honestly, Father.

157
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:15,061
You're really juvenile.

158
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:31,991
Hey, Telly,
did I tell you my dad's
taking me to Wyoming?

159
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,035
Wyoming?

160
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:35,603
Hey, Wyoming.

161
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,997
That's a wonderful state.

162
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,477
Listen, you remind me
 to tell you the time
 I hunted grizzlies

163
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:43,698
up in the Big Horns there.

164
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:45,004
You hunted grizzlies
 in Wyoming?

165
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,527
Ho, ho, ho.

166
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,834
I hunted them,
 I fought them,
 I skinned them alive.

167
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:52,141
Yes, sir, Butch,
 believe me.

168
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,665
Oh, come on,
 Telford, don't tell
 the boy wild stories.

169
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,406
You've never been
 out of Cleveland
 in your life.

170
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,321
Jeff,
 that was uncalled for.

171
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:01,933
I don't think
 he should be telling
 the boy wild stories.

172
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:10,159
Tell me about Wyoming
 tomorrow, okay, Telly.

173
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:14,381
I'm sorry, Dad.

174
00:17:14,424 --> 00:17:16,513
Well, I gotta go.

175
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:18,820
Hey, hey.
 Where are you going?

176
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:20,691
I think Billy Graham
 is on.

177
00:17:21,257 --> 00:17:22,302
Billy Graham?

178
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,782
Billy Graham?

179
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:29,787
Now, see what you did.

180
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:32,660
Billy Graham.
 The kid's gonna go
 and be a priest.

181
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:41,538
Herbie and I
were playing football
this afternoon

182
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,627
out in the front yard,

183
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:46,413
and he collapsed
 at my feet.

184
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:47,631
He's so weak.

185
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,814
Robert, did you hear
 what I said?

186
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:59,643
He can't even play
 a five-minute game
 of football.

187
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,906
Don't worry about him,
he's going to be okay.

188
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,560
Lighten up.

189
00:18:06,041 --> 00:18:09,044
You just won't
 accept the facts,
 will you?

190
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:14,919
The facts.
You want to know the facts?
Okay.

191
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,225
Fact, they did
 catch it early.

192
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:17,444
Fact, the treatments
 are working.

193
00:18:17,487 --> 00:18:19,359
Fact, he has stabilized.

194
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:21,665
My God, Kathy.

195
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,320
The first cloud
 on the horizon, you make
 a hurricane out of it.

196
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,848
Look, he's going
 to be fine.

197
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:33,677
Sure.

198
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:39,944
Every human being 
on the face of the Earth

199
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:43,078
has been subject
to disease and death.

200
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:48,127
Some of us are subjected
to even severe suffering.
Maybe even...

201
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,172
Hey, slugger.
How was your day?

202
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:53,088
Play ball
 with the guys?

203
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,134
Knock a couple over
 the left field fence?

204
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:58,049
I was at the clinic, Dad.

205
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,400
Well, play some catch
 after dinner, huh?

206
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:05,448
I already played with Mom.

207
00:19:05,492 --> 00:19:07,755
Herbie, Robert!

208
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:09,713
So Colter was
 a mountain man.

209
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:11,802
And his bones
 was rattling.

210
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,196
Were rattling.

211
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,852
Were rattling
 inside of him,
 he was so hungry.

212
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:20,333
So, Colter ate
a buffalo chip.

213
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:23,118
He was that hungry.
Got him through though.

214
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,424
Well, what's
a buffalo chip?

215
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,861
Now, honey,
I wouldn't bother.

216
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:29,603
You're kidding.
 She doesn't know
 what a buffalo chip is?

217
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:31,126
Well, that's why
 I'm asking.

218
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:35,913
Mom, you really don't know
 what a buffalo chip is?

219
00:19:35,957 --> 00:19:37,654
Sorry, I don't think
 you want to know
 over dinner.

220
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,442
Herbert T. McGrath,
you tell me now,
I do want to know.

221
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:51,190
It's a gigantic cow dump.

222
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:53,931
A huge cow dump.

223
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:55,977
Oh!

224
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,718
They get baked hard
 in the summer.

225
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:01,243
Well, mountain men like Colter
 get so hungry...

226
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:03,593
It's just like a dark pancake
 lying on the prairie.

227
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:05,987
Enough, Herbie.

228
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,555
You just pick one up,
 plop it on in your mouth.

229
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:11,471
All right, Herbie.

230
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:13,995
Of course, it's not
 as good as your chicken,
 honest, Mom, really.

231
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:16,519
Thanks a lot,
I was worried there
for a minute.

232
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,483
That Colter...

233
00:20:23,526 --> 00:20:25,006
He was some guy,
 huh, Dad?

234
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:26,486
Yeah, he was some guy.

235
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:28,531
Hmm.

236
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:30,707
He was terrific.
 I think we ought to
 have him over for dinner.

237
00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,883
Well, you wanted to know.
 Didn't she, Dad?

238
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,756
Excuse me.

239
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,584
Yeah.You're excused.

240
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,848
Incredible stroke
 of luck.

241
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:43,807
Now that we've picked up
 the antique shop,

242
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,548
I have half a block.

243
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:49,378
Antique shop?

244
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:55,297
Antique shop.
 Herbie hangs out
 down there.

245
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:57,691
Well, the old man
 wasn't paying his bills.

246
00:20:57,734 --> 00:20:58,648
We close the deal
 next week.

247
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,998
Next week? Robert.

248
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:04,524
You've been promising
 Herbie that Wyoming trip
 for months.

249
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,526
Can't you put
 your business off?

250
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:09,268
I can't put it off.
 This thing can't be
 put on the back burner.

251
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,313
But his trip,
 it's so important
 to him.

252
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:13,097
It's all
he talks about.

253
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:15,665
This is a very
 complicated case,
 believe me.

254
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:18,755
So, Wyoming's
 off, huh?

255
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:20,540
Right.

256
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:24,152
You lied.

257
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:26,023
You promised me
 and you lied!

258
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,590
Way to go, hotshot. Thanks a lot.

259
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,505
I want to go
 to Wyoming.

260
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:30,898
Look Herbie,
 we'll go next spring.

261
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:31,942
I don't want to
go next spring,
I want to go now.

262
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:33,509
I can't do that.

263
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:35,946
You lied.

264
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,208
You always do that.
 You make promises
 and then you lie.

265
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:38,775
Herbie, look, I have
 other responsibilities.

266
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:40,908
You promised!
You promised!
You promised!

267
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:42,257
Stop it, Herbie!

268
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,302
You promised!
 You promised!
 You promised!

269
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,000
How dare you? Herbie, I'm sorry.

270
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:48,611
It's my job, Kathy.

271
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,626
You still miss your dog,
 don't you?

272
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:48,845
Yeah.

273
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:51,500
Yeah, me, too.

274
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:58,638
Herbie, I...

275
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:02,381
I'm sorry about
 what happened earlier.

276
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,688
I'm sorry
 about Wyoming.

277
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:11,302
Hey, we'll get
 another dog

278
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:14,480
and we'll all take
the trip to Wyoming
next spring. Okay?

279
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:22,009
Look, I know you're
 disappointed. It's...

280
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,314
It's just...

281
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:28,668
I want to do
the best job I can
to provide for you and Mom.

282
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,541
I'm the one
 that's dying, Dad.

283
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,126
Herbie. Come on, let's go.

284
00:23:52,169 --> 00:23:54,128
The game starts
 in five minutes.

285
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:56,173
Grab your bike,
we need you
at shortstop.

286
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:57,784
Okay, okay,
 I'm coming.

287
00:24:32,427 --> 00:24:33,602
Oh, Herbie.

288
00:24:58,148 --> 00:25:00,542
Herbie! Stop it!

289
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:02,283
Stop it! Stop it.

290
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:05,852
It's okay.

291
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,376
Okay.

292
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:10,770
It's okay.

293
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:12,511
It's okay.

294
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,469
Telly.

295
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,039
Telly?

296
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,521
Telly?

297
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:26,525
Telly?

298
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,319
Telly?

299
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:40,539
Telly.

300
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:49,286
Gotcha.

301
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,027
You scared me, Telly.

302
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:52,551
Well, you better
 be scared

303
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:53,639
because I'm going to
 cut out your gizzard

304
00:25:53,682 --> 00:25:55,641
and I'm going
to feed it to the dogs.

305
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:57,643
Telly, people don't
 have gizzards.

306
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:59,340
Well, I'll cut out
 your liver.

307
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:02,561
Oh, duel
 to the death, huh?

308
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,569
Ah!

309
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:12,483
Ah!

310
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:14,529
Wait! Oh!
 Hey, hey, hey.

311
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,771
We didn't
 want to, Dad.

312
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:47,649
My shop?

313
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:50,260
You can't take my shop.
 It's my life.

314
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:54,308
We, uh, couldn't
 make the payments
 any longer.

315
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:59,095
Well, wait a minute.

316
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,970
Who's taking
 my shop?

317
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:07,451
Sloan and
 uh, McGrath.

318
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,290
Butch?

319
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,552
Butch, wait a minute.
 Don't leave.

320
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,642
It's not
 your fault, Butch!

321
00:27:27,341 --> 00:27:29,082
I need you, Butch.

322
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:50,233
Herbie, I got tickets
 for the baseball game,
 Saturday.

323
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:51,278
Herbie?

324
00:27:55,369 --> 00:27:56,849
What are you doing?

325
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,285
I can't stand you!

326
00:28:05,118 --> 00:28:06,206
Where is he?

327
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,687
What's the matter?

328
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,340
All right, Herbie,
 I don't know what
 the hell your problem is.

329
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:12,081
What's going on?

330
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,430
Why did you
 do that, huh?
 Answer me.

331
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:15,302
Somebody tell me,
 what is it?

332
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:16,607
What is it?
What is it?

333
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:17,739
You tell her, Herbie.

334
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:20,829
No, wait,
 I'll tell her.

335
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:23,876
He stormed into my study
and he started throwing
my books everywhere.

336
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,878
You talk to him.
I don't seem able
to get through.

337
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,531
He stole Telly's shop.

338
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:32,711
Robert, calm down.

339
00:28:32,754 --> 00:28:33,755
You're over reacting. Over reacting?

340
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:35,278
He destroyed
 my study.

341
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:39,979
You stole Telly's shop.
You're a thief.

342
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:40,893
Don't you ever
 talk like that to me.

343
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:42,372
Robert, stop it!

344
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:45,593
What are you
 talking about?

345
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:47,551
Are you talking about
 the antique store?

346
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:49,205
Yeah.

347
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:50,685
He stole it from Telly.
 Robbed him!

348
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:54,776
Okay. All right.
 I get it, I get it, Herbie.

349
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,213
Herbie, I'm sorry
 for your friend.

350
00:28:57,257 --> 00:28:59,999
But he didn't live up
to his responsibilities.

351
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:00,913
He owed people money.

352
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,096
People should
 always live up to their
 responsibilities, huh, Dad?

353
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,315
Yeah. Right.

354
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:15,623
Like Wyoming, huh, Dad?

355
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:37,558
Telly!

356
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,734
Telly!

357
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:43,520
Telly!

358
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:45,218
Herbie.

359
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:46,480
Telly! Enough.

360
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:48,003
What is wrong, Herbie?

361
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,483
Telly!

362
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:50,745
Now stop that now.
You're gonna
break the glass.

363
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,139
Let me go!
 Telly! Telly!

364
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:54,270
I said
 stop that now.

365
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:55,750
Herbie, what's wrong?

366
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:57,926
Telly!

367
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:58,797
Hey!

368
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:01,625
Telly.

369
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,541
Let me go!

370
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:06,805
You touch that kid again,
 you'll be singing soprano
 at the opera!

371
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:08,850
Dad!

372
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:10,330
I'm not
 helping him move!

373
00:30:10,373 --> 00:30:11,766
Oh! Where you going, Telly?

374
00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:18,164
Well, Butch, they're...
 They're sending me
 away to die.

375
00:30:19,556 --> 00:30:20,949
Going to
 the old age home.

376
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,910
Land of the
 stumbling dead.

377
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:27,521
Jeff, would you come in
 and help me please?

378
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:30,089
I guess this is it, Butch.

379
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:31,873
End of the trail.

380
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:33,222
Final sunset.

381
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:55,636
Dad!

382
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:58,900
They're waiting for you.

383
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:03,122
We're...
 We're ready to go.

384
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,603
Dad? I'm not deaf!

385
00:31:09,563 --> 00:31:12,131
Just wanna make some
 old friends comfortable,

386
00:31:13,045 --> 00:31:14,350
before I leave.

387
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:18,180
Dad.

388
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:26,275
I wanna die.

389
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:27,537
Oh, Dad!

390
00:31:32,107 --> 00:31:33,892
Think I will.

391
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,589
Why don't you leave?

392
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:37,939
Just, both of you, go.
 Close the door
 and lock it after you.

393
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:40,463
I'll be dead
 in three days.

394
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:42,074
A skeleton in seven.

395
00:31:49,864 --> 00:31:52,780
Dad, what is
 the matter with you?

396
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:54,651
What the hell
 are you doing?

397
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:58,568
Why did you do that?
 You know you're gonna
 need those this afternoon.

398
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:01,789
How do you
 work this thing?

399
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:04,966
Listen, I know
 how you're feeling and I feel
 very, very badly for you.

400
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,578
But I am sick and tired
of your treating me
like a fool.

401
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:10,798
I mean, you...

402
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:14,323
You think I'm stupid,
don't you?

403
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:16,108
I sure do!

404
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:19,154
Yeah, well, I paid for these
 and you're gonna wear 'em.

405
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,809
Jeffery!Hey!

406
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:25,552
Honest to God, Nance,
 I try. I really do.

407
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:28,163
I'm patient,
 I'm even-tempered,

408
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:30,557
but sometimes your father...
 Sometimes he...

409
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,429
You really piss me off!

410
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:36,867
Jeffrey Bauman,
 I am surprised at you!

411
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:38,695
Oh, I am, too!

412
00:32:38,739 --> 00:32:40,436
Well, it's the truth.

413
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,919
Admit it, Telford,
 you've always, always
 had it out for me!

414
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,530
He thinks I'm stupid.

415
00:32:47,574 --> 00:32:49,837
Well, let me tell you
 something, pops!

416
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,709
I am summa cum laude
 from Brandeis.

417
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:56,583
Summa! Summa! Summa!

418
00:32:58,193 --> 00:33:01,196
That is not a stupid man!
 Summa!

419
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,458
I think we better
 take me to the home.

420
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:05,679
Summa! Summa!
 Summa, Telford!
 Summa! Summa!

421
00:33:05,722 --> 00:33:07,681
Jeffery! Why don't you shut up?

422
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:09,335
Summa, Telford!

423
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:12,251
Everybody will think
there's a Japanese wrestler
loose in here.

424
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,254
Old fart!

425
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:24,741
Wyoming.

426
00:33:31,705 --> 00:33:33,881
You can't take us all.

427
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,624
It's over

428
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:39,234
for you,

429
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:40,627
Cassidy.

430
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:54,249
Seems
 like a nice place.

431
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:56,208
Let's move on to
something else.

432
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:58,166
It's very clean, Dad.

433
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,950
And, you know, the library
 and the reception area,

434
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:01,561
I didn't notice that
 this afternoon.

435
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:04,042
Oh, whoopee!

436
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,826
Well, we'll talk
 about it this weekend.

437
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:09,090
You do remember
 that you're coming
 this weekend?

438
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:10,091
Yeah.

439
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,312
What's the matter
 with him?

440
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:14,704
It's a very
nice place.

441
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:17,403
Never mind.

442
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:21,450
Hello.Hello.

443
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:28,022
So, how was dinner, Dad?
 I hear the food's
 pretty good.

444
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,850
It'll pass.

445
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:31,895
Oh, come on, Telford,
 she's just trying
 to be nice.

446
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:34,159
We wanna help you.

447
00:34:34,202 --> 00:34:37,075
Help?
That's what everybody's
trying to do, help.

448
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:41,122
Here, look at this.

449
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:43,777
"Today is Friday.
 Weather is sunny.

450
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,127
"Next holiday
 is Halloween."

451
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,389
Okay. Oh!

452
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:49,087
Look at that.
 What do we have here?

453
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:52,307
"Next meal
 is breakfast."

454
00:34:52,351 --> 00:34:54,701
Well, some people need
 to know these things.

455
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,790
Yeah, like you,
 for instance.

456
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:59,009
I'll be suffocated
 with help here.

457
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:01,403
"The next person you see
 tomorrow morning
 will be yourself."

458
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,579
"Your next bowel movement
 will be precisely
 in two hours."

459
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:04,711
Dad!

460
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:07,148
Oh, it's
 a duck farm here!

461
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:09,977
Duck farm!
 Who needs your help?

462
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,415
Got plenty of help.
I can take care
of myself.

463
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:15,765
Duck farm!
Trying to help!

464
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:17,811
That's what it is,
 a duck farm!

465
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:22,598
I want my money.

466
00:35:23,904 --> 00:35:25,471
You mean close out
 your account?

467
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:26,820
Yup.

468
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:28,474
May I ask why?

469
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,998
No, ma'am.
Just cough it up, $100.

470
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,347
Yes, sir.

471
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:44,316
20, 40, 50, 60,
 70, 80, 90, 100.

472
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:50,017
Keep that
 for your record.

473
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:53,325
This is where
 we're going, Telly.

474
00:35:53,368 --> 00:35:55,065
Hole in the Wall.

475
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:56,850
And we'll just be gone
 for a couple of weeks.

476
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,200
Then we can come
 right back, okay?

477
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:00,767
Ah, it ain't gonna
work, Butch.

478
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,334
Why not?

479
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:05,075
I mean, we can rob a bank.

480
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,252
And...
 And shoot grizzly bear.

481
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:09,645
Please, Telly?

482
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:12,822
Well, I promised Nancy
 and bozo brain I'd come over
 for the weekend.

483
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:15,564
Please, Telly?

484
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:19,699
Besides, Wyoming
 is not
 what it used to be.

485
00:36:19,742 --> 00:36:22,441
McDonald's
 all over the place.

486
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:25,095
There aren't
any grizzly bears
left there anymore.

487
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:32,712
Jeff says you've never
 been out of Cleveland
 in your life.

488
00:36:32,755 --> 00:36:35,454
Who the hell
 are you gonna believe?
 Me or him?

489
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:36,933
I told you I fought
 grizzlies in Wyoming.

490
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,202
I'm sorry my dad
took your shop.

491
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:48,467
Well, not your fault.

492
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:52,775
I'm going anyhow.
 With or without you.

493
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:55,909
Butch...

494
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:01,610
Well, all right.
 Maybe.

495
00:37:02,524 --> 00:37:04,047
I'll tell you what.

496
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:07,137
In the alley,
tomorrow night,
behind my shop.

497
00:37:07,181 --> 00:37:08,530
If I'm there,
 I'm going.

498
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:11,751
If I'm not,
I'm not.

499
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:16,669
Okay.

500
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:03,672
Oh, my God!

501
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:04,978
You scared me, Telly!

502
00:38:05,021 --> 00:38:07,023
Its Hole in the Wall
 or bust!

503
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:11,550
All right!
 We're going!

504
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:13,073
Sure you got
 enough gas?

505
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:15,597
Oh! Oh!

506
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:18,252
Compliments
 of my son-in-law.

507
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,340
Climb aboard! All right!

508
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:20,646
Climb aboard! Let's go!

509
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:23,083
Here we go!

510
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:37,793
Yoo-hoo!

511
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:50,023
Telly, look out!

512
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:51,241
Ooh!

513
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:53,896
Wow!

514
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,550
Doggone drunk!

515
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:59,119
This thing sounds bad.

516
00:38:59,162 --> 00:39:01,730
It hasn't been out
 of the garage
 in two years.

517
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:04,994
Telly, you just
 ran a red light.

518
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:06,953
Huh?

519
00:39:06,996 --> 00:39:09,608
Well, maybe
 if it'd stop raining,
 I could see a thing.

520
00:39:12,698 --> 00:39:14,961
You just ran
 another red light!

521
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:20,183
Well, it takes a while
 to get the hang of things.

522
00:39:20,227 --> 00:39:24,884
Telly, I don't
 wanna get thrown in jail
 in Cleveland.

523
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:28,409
Well, maybe
 we better get off
 the main drag, huh?

524
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,198
Oh, my God!

525
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:36,286
Dear God, no!

526
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,766
What's the matter?

527
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,942
Herbie's gone! What?

528
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:41,161
He's gone!

529
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,076
I'll call the police.

530

♪ Whoopee ti yi yo,

♪ You know that Wyoming 
will be your new home ♪

532
00:40:04,837 --> 00:40:07,622
I said I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean
 to run out of gas.

533
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:09,537
I think somebody
 drained my tank.

534
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:12,018
Honestly, Jeffery,
 I told Dad that
 we'd be here by 8:00.

535
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:13,411
I don't see
 what the big deal is,

536
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:14,542
we just saw him
yesterday.

537
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:15,935
It's a rough time
 in his life.

538
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:17,066
He hates me.

539
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,112
If that's what
 makes him happy.

540
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:24,596
I will.

541
00:40:25,031 --> 00:40:26,336
I know.

542
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,555
I tried to call you,
 but no answer.

543
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,252
What happened?

544
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,298
Well, I don't know
 how to say this, but...

545
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:33,126
Dad. Is it Dad?
Oh, no!

546
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:34,562
He's not, um...

547
00:40:34,606 --> 00:40:37,478
Oh, no, it's not that,
 he's all right.

548
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:39,175
He ran away last night.

549
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,091
Oh, no!

550
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:43,658
He what?

551
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,619
Hey, you feelin'
 all right, Butch?

552
00:40:47,662 --> 00:40:49,838
Look a little pale.
Homesick, eh?

553
00:40:49,882 --> 00:40:51,927
Gee no!
 My home's on the range.

554
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:11,991
Evenin'. Evenin'.

555
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:13,514
Might as well
 fill her up.

556
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:14,602
Don't move, mister!

557
00:41:16,604 --> 00:41:18,476
Don't move a muscle.

558
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:20,739
Get the keys
 to the register, Sundance.

559
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:22,958
Will you put
 that thing down?

560
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:25,004
Go on and do
 what you have to do,
 piddle.

561
00:41:30,444 --> 00:41:31,358
Where's the bathroom, sir?

562
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:34,404
Inside the store, son.

563
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:37,277
Get back there
 and don't move!
 I'll blow your head off!

564
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:41,368
I got a boy
about the same age.

565
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:46,547
Kids get the darndest
 notions nowadays.

566
00:41:46,591 --> 00:41:47,679
Yeah.

567
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,452
Dadgum it.

568
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:24,411
Lousy transmission.

569
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:29,590
Sounds like my mother's
old washing machine.

570
00:42:29,634 --> 00:42:32,419
Well, it...
 No sense
 in taking chances.

571
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:34,552
We better go back,
 check it out.

572
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:38,599
Plenty of place
to turn here.

573
00:42:58,097 --> 00:42:59,620
Butch, go inside
 and get that guy
 out here, will ya?

574
00:43:06,845 --> 00:43:08,237
Mister?

575
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:09,761
Is anybody here?

576
00:43:15,767 --> 00:43:16,942
Ow!

577
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:19,379
One peep out of you
 and you're dead!

578
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:22,948
Now get that old man
in here, quick!

579
00:43:22,991 --> 00:43:24,950
Telly! Telly!

580
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:26,604
Hurry, Telly,
 I need ya!

581
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:32,435
Please don't
 hurt him, mister.

582
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,654
Shut up, dummy!

583
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,787
Butch? Butch...

584
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,615
Hold it right there,
 old man!

585
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:42,576
I want all of it.
 Every last penny.

586
00:43:44,447 --> 00:43:46,188
I don't have
anything, mister.

587
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:47,799
Don't tell me that!
 Come on,
 get up against there.

588
00:43:47,842 --> 00:43:49,714
All right, take what you want,
 but don't hurt my boy please.

589
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:51,019
Just don't hurt my boy!Please, mister.

590
00:43:51,063 --> 00:43:52,194
Mister, please!Is that it?

591
00:43:52,238 --> 00:43:53,413
Boy, I oughta...

592
00:43:53,456 --> 00:43:54,675
Please!

593
00:43:57,983 --> 00:43:59,506
Tough guy, huh?

594
00:43:59,549 --> 00:44:02,291
Well, maybe I can use you.

595
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:04,206
What are you talking about?
 Leave that boy alone!

596
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,513
Shut up!

597
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:10,473
I need a partner.
 Robbing gas stations
 and banks.

598
00:44:10,517 --> 00:44:12,954
Yeah, I think he'll
work out just fine.

599
00:44:12,998 --> 00:44:15,130
Look at him,
he even looks
like a bank robber.

600
00:44:15,174 --> 00:44:16,479
No, I don't!

601
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:18,525
Is he smart?

602
00:44:18,568 --> 00:44:20,745
No, please, Telly.
 I flunked math.

603
00:44:21,615 --> 00:44:23,138
Well...

604
00:44:23,182 --> 00:44:26,315
Yeah, yeah, he is smart.
 I have to admit that.

605
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:28,491
I am not!
 I don't even know
 my times tables, mister!

606
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:29,841
Flunked math!

607
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:33,888
Hell, you couldn't
 even count the money!

608
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,415
Try to follow me and
 I'll blow your heads off.

609
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,299
Butch, quick.

610
00:44:53,342 --> 00:44:54,561
Get in the car.

611
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:08,618
Tell your nephew
 he did a great job!

612
00:45:09,228 --> 00:45:10,577
It was worth the 20.

613
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,839
Glad to help out.

614
00:45:11,883 --> 00:45:13,058
All right.

615
00:45:23,677 --> 00:45:26,767
Well, we didn't come out
 of that too bad.

616
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:29,378
Eh, he was
 in such a hurry,
 he only got 20.

617
00:45:29,422 --> 00:45:32,251
We can make that up easy
 when we hit the bank
 in the next town.

618
00:45:32,294 --> 00:45:33,121
What do you mean?

619
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:35,210
A hold up!

620
00:45:35,254 --> 00:45:37,082
Oh, sure. Well, as soon as
 we make camp for the night

621
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:38,387
we'll plan out
 the whole thing.

622
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,303
Uh-uh, no way! Uh-uh.

623
00:45:41,347 --> 00:45:43,523
Oh, I thought
 you wanted
 to rob banks?

624
00:45:45,264 --> 00:45:47,570
Telly,

625
00:45:47,614 --> 00:45:49,964
some things should
 just be make believe.

626
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:54,186
Oh.

627
00:45:57,058 --> 00:45:59,539
Are you sure
 you know where
 you're going, Telly?

628
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:01,715
You wanna go to Wyoming,
 don't you?

629
00:46:18,906 --> 00:46:22,344
This looks like
a good place
to spend the night.

630
00:46:22,388 --> 00:46:24,694
I think we'll pull off
right here.

631
00:46:27,872 --> 00:46:29,438
There we are.

632
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:34,661
Looks like we got
 some slow traffic up ahead.

633
00:46:34,704 --> 00:46:37,055
Look, Telly, he's hurt.
He's hurt.

634
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:38,621
Hmm?

635
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:40,275
Telly, let me out.
 Let me out, he's hurt.

636
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:51,721
Come here, boy.

637
00:46:56,074 --> 00:46:57,858
Can we keep him,
 Telly?

638
00:46:57,902 --> 00:46:59,425
Can we?
 Look, he doesn't
 have a collar.

639
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:01,862
Wait a minute.
 Let me see here.

640
00:47:01,906 --> 00:47:03,777
And he is hungry, too.
 Can we, please?

641
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,953
Now, wait a minute. Can we?

642
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,521
Oh.

643
00:47:10,523 --> 00:47:11,567
Butch...

644
00:47:11,611 --> 00:47:13,308
What's wrong, Telly?

645
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:16,137
You leave this dog be.

646
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:24,580
Just leave
 this dog be.

647
00:47:24,624 --> 00:47:26,147
No.
No, Telly. No!

648
00:47:27,627 --> 00:47:29,759
He needs me.
 He's hungry.

649
00:47:29,803 --> 00:47:31,587
Did you hear me?
 Leave that dog be!

650
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:32,806
Let me go!

651
00:47:34,329 --> 00:47:35,896
You're just
 a mean old man!

652
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,594
All you care about
 is old chairs
 and tables and junk!

653
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:42,250
Butch. Butch!

654
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:44,035
Come back here, boy!

655
00:47:44,078 --> 00:47:46,602
Come back!
 It's not your fault!

656
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:48,300
Come on.
 It's not your fault.

657
00:47:48,343 --> 00:47:49,779
I'm not
gonna hurt you.

658
00:47:49,823 --> 00:47:52,434
Butch! Butch,
 you come back here!

659
00:47:53,609 --> 00:47:55,785
Butch!

660
00:47:55,829 --> 00:47:58,397
Where are you going?
 You leave that dog be.

661
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:03,576
Here, boy.

662
00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:41,500
I love you, Butch.

663
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:13,532
You always do that.
You make promises
and then you lie!

664
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:14,750
I have
other responsibilities.

665
00:50:14,794 --> 00:50:16,056
You promised!
You promised!

666
00:50:17,623 --> 00:50:20,669
I guess this is it, partner.
 End of the trail.

667
00:50:20,713 --> 00:50:22,802
The final sunset.

668
00:50:22,845 --> 00:50:24,238
Herbie, I don't
ever wanna hear you say
you're dying again,

669
00:50:24,282 --> 00:50:25,109
you understand?

670
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:28,634
Herbie. Herbie!

671
00:50:28,677 --> 00:50:30,636
Stop it!
 Stop it! Stop it!

672
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:33,769
Honey, it's okay.

673
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:42,082
Smokey!

674
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,303
Smokey!

675
00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:46,608
Smokey!

676
00:51:44,927 --> 00:51:46,494
Telly!

677
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:49,149
Telly, you let him die!
You let him die! Telly!

678
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:51,195
How could you?

679
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:54,154
How...

680
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:56,461
That's Old Grizz, son.

681
00:51:56,504 --> 00:51:58,506
Eighteen years old
 he was.

682
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:02,249
Friend of mine.

683
00:52:02,293 --> 00:52:07,080
Yesterday afternoon
 he came up and put his nose
 right in the palm of my hand.

684
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:08,299
And I knew.

685
00:52:09,256 --> 00:52:11,693
Knew what?

686
00:52:11,737 --> 00:52:13,608
He was
 telling me goodbye.

687
00:52:16,307 --> 00:52:19,832
Guess he wanted
 to take a last stroll
 through the woods.

688
00:52:21,877 --> 00:52:25,142
Wouldn't be right to
 keep him from his last wish,
 would it?

689
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:27,187
No.

690
00:52:29,624 --> 00:52:31,800
Do you believe
 dogs go to heaven?

691
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:38,720
I don't know.

692
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:43,812
I think they do.

693
00:52:49,557 --> 00:52:50,906
Telly!

694
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,169
Telly!

695
00:52:55,694 --> 00:52:58,566
Well, I better
 get going on this.

696
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,568
Sorry about it.

697
00:53:00,612 --> 00:53:02,179
All right.
 All right.

698
00:53:02,222 --> 00:53:03,615
Come on, Butch.

699
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:07,488
Goodbye, Grizz.

700
00:53:11,231 --> 00:53:12,798
Sorry, Telly.

701
00:53:14,669 --> 00:53:15,627
Butch.

702
00:53:18,151 --> 00:53:19,718
I love you, Telly.

703
00:53:42,349 --> 00:53:45,526
Telly, when you looked
 in Old Grizz's eyes, I mean,

704
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:47,572
well, how could you tell?

705
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:53,665
Well, Butch, I guess
 when you reach my age

706
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:56,537
you just know
 when another old dog
 is near his time.

707
00:53:58,496 --> 00:54:00,280
What do you see
 in my eyes?

708
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,064
Your eyes?

709
00:54:02,108 --> 00:54:03,762
I see a lot of mischief,
 is what I see.

710
00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:05,720
No, really, Telly,
 look at me.

711
00:54:11,073 --> 00:54:13,641
I see a good life, Butch.
 Full of adventure.

712
00:54:15,687 --> 00:54:18,385
Wow!

713
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:20,300
Look at these mountains,
 they look like
 ice cream cones.

714
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,128
Yeah.

715
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:24,086
You know what
 we ought to do?

716
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,523
We ought to
 buy a couple
 of these mountains.

717
00:54:25,566 --> 00:54:27,176
Take 'em back
 to Cleveland.

718
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,614
You're right.

719
00:54:29,657 --> 00:54:32,443
Folks back home would
 appreciate seeing them
 outside the kitchen windows.

720
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:58,251
We must be
 getting close to Wyoming,
 huh, Telly?

721
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:00,471
Yeah.

722
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:02,473
There it is!

723
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:03,691
All right!

724
00:55:20,534 --> 00:55:22,449
Yoo-hoo!

725
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,901
Did not! Did too.

726
00:55:39,945 --> 00:55:41,599
Did not! Did too.

727
00:55:41,642 --> 00:55:43,470
Did not! Did too.

728
00:55:43,514 --> 00:55:45,646
Old Butch
 was all the time
 shooting people.

729
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,780
Butch never shot people!

730
00:55:48,823 --> 00:55:50,085
Just Indians.

731
00:55:50,129 --> 00:55:52,261
All Butch did
 was shoot Indians.

732
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:02,837
Well, I guess Indians
 are people too, huh, Tel?

733
00:56:04,056 --> 00:56:05,579
I guess they are.

734
00:56:17,722 --> 00:56:21,290
Telly! Telly!
 Indians! Indians!

735
00:56:21,334 --> 00:56:24,772
Indians? There are
 no Indians out there.

736
00:56:24,816 --> 00:56:27,166
Yeah, there is, Telly.
 There's Indians out there.

737
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:28,602
Oh, come on, Butch!

738
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:32,345
There's Indians, Telly,
 really.

739
00:56:40,135 --> 00:56:42,747
You gotta use
 your imagination, Telly.

740
00:56:56,978 --> 00:56:57,936
Telly?

741
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:17,477
Hey, Butch,
 you in there?

742
00:57:17,521 --> 00:57:19,218
Get out of here,
 you dirty old man!

743
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:20,088
Oh, my golly!

744
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:21,960
I'm not Butch!

745
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:22,743
Well, I...

746
00:57:27,835 --> 00:57:29,924
Telly, where have you been?
I've been looking
all over for you.

747
00:57:29,968 --> 00:57:31,491
Hey, I thought
 you were in there.

748
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:32,884
Come on. Well...

749
00:57:51,946 --> 00:57:54,035
Hey, Telly,
 let's go inside.

750
00:57:55,297 --> 00:57:57,212
Why, you can't
 go in there!

751
00:57:57,256 --> 00:58:00,651
Did you read that sign?
They'll throw you
out of there. Come on.

752
00:58:00,694 --> 00:58:02,435
Say, fellas,
 what's the problem?

753
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,655
Well, boy
wants to go inside,

754
00:58:04,698 --> 00:58:06,570
I'm afraid
 he's a little too young.

755
00:58:06,613 --> 00:58:09,921
Don't you worry about that.
 My name is Lester.

756
00:58:09,964 --> 00:58:12,053
I'm Herbie.
 I mean Butch.

757
00:58:12,097 --> 00:58:13,751
Yeah, and you can
 call me Telly.

758
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:16,362
Well, you look kind of
 familiar, Butch.

759
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:19,234
I've been around.

760
00:58:19,278 --> 00:58:21,454
Hey, you fellas
 play cards?

761
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,977
Er, cards? Er...

762
00:58:23,674 --> 00:58:25,545
Well, yeah.

763
00:58:25,589 --> 00:58:27,591
Well, come on in,
 I'll take care of it.

764
00:58:27,634 --> 00:58:29,767
Well, that's
mighty nice of you.

765
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:38,253
Come on, fellas,
 this way.

766
00:59:01,276 --> 00:59:03,278
This is gonna cost you
 five bucks.

767
00:59:03,322 --> 00:59:04,628
$5?

768
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:05,933
All right.

769
00:59:07,282 --> 00:59:08,588
Well, I'll see ya.

770
00:59:14,725 --> 00:59:16,030
I'm out.

771
00:59:16,074 --> 00:59:17,031
Too rich for ya, huh?

772
00:59:17,075 --> 00:59:18,119
$5.

773
00:59:19,077 --> 00:59:20,078
All right!

774
00:59:20,948 --> 00:59:22,602
I'll see that.

775
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,778
Hey, what do you
 think you're doing?

776
00:59:28,695 --> 00:59:31,742
I have an ace high flush
 you're gonna have to beat.

777
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:33,178
Ace high flu...

778
00:59:34,832 --> 00:59:35,833
I'm out!

779
00:59:36,616 --> 00:59:38,096
Beats me.

780
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:39,750
Well, I guess it's mine.

781
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:46,017
What?

782
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,366
Butch?

783
00:59:47,409 --> 00:59:48,628
Butch, what's the matter?
 You all right?

784
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:51,326
I'm sick, Telly.

785
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:54,286
Excuse me just a minute,
I think the boy
needs a little air.

786
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:55,896
Back door there,
 take him out.

787
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:57,985
Here, right here. Come on.

788
00:59:58,029 --> 01:00:01,249
All right.
Guess that cigar
made him a little sick.

789
01:00:01,293 --> 01:00:02,381
Come on, let's go.

790
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:03,991
Well, it's my deal,
is it?

791
01:00:04,035 --> 01:00:05,079
Mmm-hmm.

792
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:08,474
Butch.

793
01:00:08,517 --> 01:00:12,130
Butch, that is the meanest,
low down, rottenest idea
I've ever run across.

794
01:00:12,173 --> 01:00:13,653
I know.

795
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:16,308
What kind of a guy
 do you think I am?

796
01:00:17,178 --> 01:00:18,179
Well...

797
01:00:21,443 --> 01:00:22,488
Come on!

798
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:31,453
Well, I'm sorry, gentlemen,
 but I think
 I've done you again.

799
01:00:34,456 --> 01:00:35,849
Well, beats me!

800
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:38,069
Oh, that beats me, too.

801
01:00:41,246 --> 01:00:43,683
You know, fellas,
 this is sure gonna make
 things easier for the boy.

802
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:44,771
Oh.

803
01:00:44,815 --> 01:00:47,295
He... He's in
really bad shape.

804
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:48,645
Yeah, I know.

805
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:50,995
You know what?

806
01:00:55,826 --> 01:00:57,610
My God! Oh, my!

807
01:01:00,961 --> 01:01:02,615
Butch.

808
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,964
Butch! Butch!

809
01:01:05,226 --> 01:01:06,532
Butch, Butch!

810
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:09,883
Butch! Butch!

811
01:01:09,927 --> 01:01:12,756
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?

812
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,148
My best friend
in the whole world

813
01:01:14,192 --> 01:01:15,584
and you sucked me in
 on a trick like that.

814
01:01:15,628 --> 01:01:17,935
Why didn't you tell me
you're dying?

815
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:20,720
I didn't think
you'd take me to Wyoming.

816
01:01:20,764 --> 01:01:23,157
My God, you're dying.
 I let you run me
 all over that countryside

817
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:25,594
chasing some crazy dream
 of cowboys and Indians.

818
01:01:25,638 --> 01:01:27,118
Well, I need
 that dream, Telly.

819
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:29,250
Well, maybe
 I need it, too,
 but not this way!

820
01:01:29,294 --> 01:01:32,210
I've been playing nursemaid
to a sick little kid.
You used me, boy!

821
01:01:32,253 --> 01:01:33,951
Did not.

822
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:35,779
Maybe I'm like
 Old Grizz.

823
01:01:35,822 --> 01:01:39,086
Maybe I needed to just take
 one last walk in the woods
 before I die.

824
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,872
You're going back.
 But first you're going
 to go to a hospital.

825
01:01:41,915 --> 01:01:43,177
No, I'm not.You're going to a hospital!

826
01:01:43,221 --> 01:01:44,613
No, way! Come on, boy!

827
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:46,572
Butch! Butch, you
 come back here!

828
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:49,880
Butch!

829
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:52,056
Butch, we can
 talk about this!

830
01:01:52,099 --> 01:01:53,927
Come on, now.
 Butch!

831
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:01,326
Butch, for heaven's sake!

832
01:02:01,369 --> 01:02:03,807
Hey, Butch!
 Come on! Come on.

833
01:02:28,614 --> 01:02:30,703
Butch! Butch,
come back here!

834
01:03:27,716 --> 01:03:29,718
Are you
 all right, son?

835
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:32,678
No, sir.

836
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:35,768
Are you a preacher?

837
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:36,638
Yes.

838
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:40,468
Can I help you, son?

839
01:03:40,512 --> 01:03:42,557
Yes, sir.

840
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:44,603
I have cancer.
 I'm scared.

841
01:03:46,213 --> 01:03:49,086
My friend back there,
 he's mad at me.

842
01:03:49,129 --> 01:03:50,565
Please help me.

843
01:03:52,611 --> 01:03:54,613
Would you like to
 pray about it?

844
01:04:08,235 --> 01:04:11,848
Lord, this boy
 has come freely

845
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:14,285
to ask for
 a touch of your hand.

846
01:04:14,328 --> 01:04:16,896
Calm his spirit.

847
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,247
Give him strength
 to believe that is your will
 for him to grow

848
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:21,901
in health and in strength.

849
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:24,469
And give him
 faith to believe

850
01:04:24,512 --> 01:04:26,688
for your great plan
 of salvation.

851
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:28,429
Amen.

852
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:33,565
Feel better, now?

853
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:45,664
Thank you.

854
01:04:59,939 --> 01:05:01,419
I'm ready.

855
01:05:01,462 --> 01:05:02,942
I'll go now, Telly.

856
01:05:43,417 --> 01:05:44,636
Why didn't you tell me?

857
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:46,159
My best friend 
in the whole world

858
01:05:46,203 --> 01:05:47,508
and you sucked me in
on a trick like that.

859
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:50,163
Why didn't you tell me
 you were dying?

860
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:13,708
- It's okay, Herbie.
- It's okay.

861
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:21,281
Dr. Jackson, outside call.

862
01:06:21,325 --> 01:06:23,196
Dr. Jackson,
outside call.

863
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,294
Hi, Sundance.

864
01:06:36,253 --> 01:06:38,037
How are you, partner?
 How you feeling?

865
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:40,866
Great. Next stop,
 Hole in the Wall.

866
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:43,303
Yeah, I was afraid
 you'd say that.

867
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:48,265
But when the preacher prayed,
 it made me feel good.

868
01:06:49,614 --> 01:06:50,702
It ain't gonna work.

869
01:06:54,793 --> 01:06:56,360
You remember
 Old Grizz, Telly?

870
01:06:56,403 --> 01:06:59,058
It ain't gonna work.

871
01:06:59,102 --> 01:07:00,886
You looked him
 straight in the eye,

872
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:03,932
and you knew
 that was the end of the line,
 huh, Sundance?

873
01:07:03,976 --> 01:07:06,413
Will you cut out
 that Sundance stuff?

874
01:07:06,457 --> 01:07:10,069
This isn't
 storyland, Butch,
 this is for real.

875
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:13,681
You're gonna go back
 to Cleveland
 and that's that.

876
01:07:13,725 --> 01:07:16,075
Besides,
 we're almost busted.

877
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:18,643
Busted?

878
01:07:18,686 --> 01:07:20,036
Busted, broke.

879
01:07:23,256 --> 01:07:25,302
Remember that $100
 I gave you, Telly?

880
01:07:25,345 --> 01:07:26,825
I still got it.

881
01:07:26,868 --> 01:07:27,956
Gave me?

882
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,132
Well, that
 you wouldn't take.

883
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:30,307
I still got it.

884
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:31,090
It ain't gonna work.

885
01:07:40,491 --> 01:07:42,014
You all right, fella?

886
01:07:50,588 --> 01:07:52,503
That ain't
 gonna work, Butch.

887
01:07:55,462 --> 01:07:57,247
Look, Butch,
 even if we wanted
 to keep on going

888
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:59,249
we'd probably
 never get past
 these bandage pushers.

889
01:07:59,292 --> 01:08:00,815
Don't you think
 they've already
 seen the paper?

890
01:08:00,859 --> 01:08:02,295
Here, look at this.

891
01:08:02,948 --> 01:08:04,123
Front page.

892
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,435
We gotta make our move
 while we still can.

893
01:08:11,478 --> 01:08:13,959
Oh, no.

894
01:08:14,002 --> 01:08:16,918
Butch, I... I...
 I don't think...
 I don't think we can, Butch.

895
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:22,141
I still don't think...

896
01:08:34,066 --> 01:08:35,285
Well, maybe.

897
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:38,331
Okay,
you get your clothes.

898
01:08:43,206 --> 01:08:45,512
I still don't think
it's going to work.

899
01:09:00,745 --> 01:09:03,965
Well, all's fair
 and square.

900
01:09:04,009 --> 01:09:05,402
Right,
 my vision of loveliness?

901
01:09:12,365 --> 01:09:14,802
Well, sweet talked
 another one.

902
01:09:14,846 --> 01:09:16,761
Best deal I ever made.

903
01:09:16,804 --> 01:09:19,198
Gun, pony
 and the trailer.

904
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:23,289
Another sucker.

905
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:37,260
Well, like my
 pappy used to say,

906
01:09:38,435 --> 01:09:40,741
love 'em and leave 'em.

907
01:09:40,785 --> 01:09:42,656
Your daddy
 doesn't know
 what he's talking about.

908
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,745
He does too,
 he's a lawyer.

909
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:29,921
What's the matter, Butch?

910
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:33,403
He's here.

911
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,579
Who's here?

912
01:10:40,279 --> 01:10:41,585
It doesn't matter.

913
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:45,328
I'm ready for him.

914
01:10:52,204 --> 01:10:53,161
Butch.

915
01:10:57,165 --> 01:10:58,732
What did it feel like?

916
01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:02,127
What do you mean?

917
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:03,607
That preacher
 praying for you.

918
01:11:06,174 --> 01:11:06,914
Like warm honey.

919
01:11:09,787 --> 01:11:11,005
Hard to beat warm honey.

920
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:13,138
Yeah.

921
01:11:35,856 --> 01:11:37,554
Come on up there.

922
01:11:47,868 --> 01:11:51,350
Oh, let me
 give you a hand
 with that, partner.

923
01:11:51,394 --> 01:11:52,308
How are you
doing today, Telly?

924
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:53,309
Uh, right.

925
01:12:01,273 --> 01:12:02,579
Get down.

926
01:12:24,644 --> 01:12:26,342
Who are those guys?

927
01:12:27,212 --> 01:12:28,518
I don't know.

928
01:12:32,696 --> 01:12:33,914
What is it?

929
01:12:35,699 --> 01:12:37,440
That's it,
 Hole in the Wall.

930
01:12:41,269 --> 01:12:43,533
Robert,
 what do you see?

931
01:12:45,056 --> 01:12:46,187
I see the car.

932
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:50,322
They're up there,
 all right.

933
01:12:59,853 --> 01:13:00,941
It's Herbie.

934
01:13:00,985 --> 01:13:02,769
Thank God.

935
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:04,771
Let's get going. No, wait.

936
01:13:04,815 --> 01:13:06,643
I'll go by myself.

937
01:13:06,686 --> 01:13:09,254
Well, sir, that's up to you.
 I can drive you up there.

938
01:13:09,297 --> 01:13:11,474
No, it's best
 if I go up alone.

939
01:13:11,517 --> 01:13:14,302
It'll be all right.

940
01:13:14,346 --> 01:13:15,521
Do you want me
 to go with you?

941
01:13:15,565 --> 01:13:17,784
No, please.
It's my responsibility.

942
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:19,438
Just give me some time.

943
01:13:28,534 --> 01:13:30,493
Butch, that's the law.

944
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:31,581
Who's that other guy?

945
01:13:35,846 --> 01:13:37,543
We got to
get out of here, Sundance,
they'll take me back.

946
01:13:39,197 --> 01:13:40,459
All right.

947
01:13:40,503 --> 01:13:42,461
Let's make a run for it.

948
01:13:43,593 --> 01:13:44,637
Come on.

949
01:13:46,683 --> 01:13:47,901
Grab that rifle, Butch.

950
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:52,993
Come on, come on.

951
01:14:01,306 --> 01:14:02,568
Come on.

952
01:14:04,222 --> 01:14:06,442
Come on, come on!

953
01:14:06,485 --> 01:14:07,530
Come on, now.

954
01:14:10,184 --> 01:14:12,491
That fella
 is still coming.

955
01:14:12,535 --> 01:14:14,058
Come on, boy,
 come on.

956
01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:29,813
Come on,
 come on.

957
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:31,728
Come on.

958
01:14:31,771 --> 01:14:34,165
He's coming.
 Who is that guy?

959
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:35,688
I don't know.

960
01:14:35,732 --> 01:14:37,560
Come on,
 let's keep going.

961
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:16,424
Hey, wait a minute.

962
01:15:16,468 --> 01:15:18,383
What?
 What's the matter?

963
01:15:18,426 --> 01:15:20,211
I know that guy.

964
01:15:20,254 --> 01:15:21,865
You do?
 Well, who is it?

965
01:15:24,302 --> 01:15:25,521
It's my dad.

966
01:15:27,392 --> 01:15:28,741
Oh, no!

967
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:31,744
We better
 get out of here.

968
01:15:31,788 --> 01:15:33,050
Oh, no!

969
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:45,453
Hey, Herbie!

970
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,416
Herbie!

971
01:15:56,421 --> 01:15:59,555
Please don't let him
 take me back, Sundance.
 Please, not yet.

972
01:16:00,643 --> 01:16:02,688
All right, Butch.

973
01:16:02,732 --> 01:16:04,429
We better split up.

974
01:16:05,822 --> 01:16:07,519
I'll cover for you.

975
01:16:08,738 --> 01:16:12,437
Well, old partner,
I guess this is it.

976
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:16,702
You know, I'd been
a rocking chair dreamer
all my life.

977
01:16:16,746 --> 01:16:20,314
I would've died one,
 if you hadn't
 come along, Butch.

978
01:16:20,358 --> 01:16:22,316
Maybe we should've
 gone to Bolivia.

979
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,971
Bolivia?
 I flunked Spanish.

980
01:16:25,015 --> 01:16:26,538
Come on, get on.

981
01:16:31,674 --> 01:16:32,805
All right.

982
01:16:35,112 --> 01:16:36,853
Okay. Okay!

983
01:16:36,896 --> 01:16:39,290
You go do it.
 Give 'em hell, Butch.

984
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,639
Give 'em hell!
Go on!

985
01:16:42,946 --> 01:16:45,601
Never say die, Butch,
 never say die!

986
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:49,866
The rocks, boy,
 you watch the rocks!

987
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:23,568
Herbie!

988
01:18:24,743 --> 01:18:25,701
Herbie!

989
01:18:50,029 --> 01:18:51,596
Another step
 and you're history.

990
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:55,295
Stop!

991
01:18:56,688 --> 01:18:57,994
I want to give up,
 Mr. Stampley.

992
01:19:03,434 --> 01:19:04,783
Don't make me do this!

993
01:19:04,827 --> 01:19:06,611
I just want to
 see my son.

994
01:19:06,654 --> 01:19:08,134
You leave us alone!

995
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:11,877
Please, Telford!

996
01:19:11,921 --> 01:19:13,487
Stop!

997
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:55,878
I want to see my son.Hey!

998
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,882
I just want to
 see my son.

999
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:01,579
He doesn't need you now.

1000
01:20:02,275 --> 01:20:03,886
No.

1001
01:20:03,929 --> 01:20:05,322
But I need him.

1002
01:20:06,323 --> 01:20:09,065
Well, I need him, too.

1003
01:20:09,108 --> 01:20:10,762
You want to
 take it all from us,
 don't you?

1004
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,286
Yeah, first my shop,
then... Then our dream.

1005
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:14,548
Well, you can't
do that.

1006
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:19,727
What are you holding?
 Keep your hands up.

1007
01:20:19,771 --> 01:20:21,642
What have you
 got there?

1008
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:25,559
Your shop, Telford,
 it's yours.

1009
01:20:33,567 --> 01:20:34,699
Yeah.

1010
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:38,703
Well, I'll be...

1011
01:20:42,489 --> 01:20:45,101
Hey, look at that.

1012
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:51,368
Well, I'll be...

1013
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:05,904
Butch.

1014
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:08,472
Butch!

1015
01:21:08,515 --> 01:21:10,517
What do you
 know about that?

1016
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:00,350
Hole in the Wall.

1017
01:22:56,058 --> 01:22:58,234
I can hear it.

1018
01:22:58,277 --> 01:23:00,410
I'm not too old!

1019
01:23:00,453 --> 01:23:03,152
I'm not too old,
 I can hear it!

1020
01:23:03,195 --> 01:23:05,502
I'm coming, Butch,
 I'm coming!

1021
01:24:46,646 --> 01:24:47,865
Butch!

1022
01:24:49,214 --> 01:24:50,476
I'm here, Butch.

1023
01:24:56,874 --> 01:24:58,528
You're too slow.

1024
01:25:04,142 --> 01:25:05,230
You're dead.

1025
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:11,541
You're a dead man, Butch.

1026
01:25:13,064 --> 01:25:14,500
You're too slow, Butch.

1027
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:16,459
You're dead.

1028
01:26:05,203 --> 01:26:07,466
You can't take us all.

1029
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:09,076
It's over for you, Cassidy.

1030
01:26:19,652 --> 01:26:21,088
Draw!

1031
01:26:21,132 --> 01:26:21,872
Draw!

1032
01:26:23,265 --> 01:26:24,396
Draw!

1033
01:26:32,012 --> 01:26:32,883
Draw!

1034
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:34,580
Draw!

1035
01:26:44,938 --> 01:26:45,852
Draw!

1036
01:26:47,463 --> 01:26:48,594
Draw!

1037
01:26:52,642 --> 01:26:53,512
Draw!

1038
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,537
Butch!

1039
01:27:23,629 --> 01:27:24,674
Cassidy!

1040
01:27:26,023 --> 01:27:27,503
Good job, Butch!

1041
01:27:47,566 --> 01:27:48,611
Herbie...

1042
01:27:54,965 --> 01:27:56,096
Hi, Herbie.

1043
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:57,489
Butch, it's Butch.

1044
01:27:58,621 --> 01:28:00,144
Yeah. Butch.

1045
01:28:06,193 --> 01:28:07,282
How's Mom?

1046
01:28:07,847 --> 01:28:09,458
She's fine.

1047
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:11,808
She's waiting for you
 down the hill.

1048
01:28:11,851 --> 01:28:12,852
She missed you.

1049
01:28:14,463 --> 01:28:15,333
I missed her, too.

1050
01:28:17,814 --> 01:28:18,554
Herbie...

1051
01:28:23,254 --> 01:28:25,648
Herbie, I'm...

1052
01:28:25,691 --> 01:28:29,434
I'm sorry I never
took you to the clinic.

1053
01:28:29,478 --> 01:28:31,131
Guess I wanted you
to be strong
for both of us, huh?

1054
01:28:32,655 --> 01:28:34,352
See, when you left home,

1055
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,529
that scared me.

1056
01:28:37,573 --> 01:28:39,575
I thought maybe
I wouldn't
see you anymore. I...

1057
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,319
I felt like
 I'd failed you
 as a father.

1058
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:49,628
I was afraid
 I was going to lose you, son.

1059
01:28:51,195 --> 01:28:52,196
I'm sorry.

1060
01:28:55,242 --> 01:28:56,243
Sorry.

1061
01:29:12,434 --> 01:29:13,522
Dad!

1062
01:29:32,628 --> 01:29:34,369
Eh, come on along, girl.

1063
01:29:34,412 --> 01:29:37,415
Come on.
 Atta girl, atta girl.

1064
01:29:37,459 --> 01:29:39,722
You did good, girl.
 You did real good.

1065
01:29:43,203 --> 01:29:45,467
Sundance!
 Sundance!
 Sundance!

1066
01:29:48,948 --> 01:29:51,951
We got to get
 out of here, Sundance,
 they're after us.

1067
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:53,823
What is it, Herbie?

1068
01:29:53,866 --> 01:29:54,954
What's the matter?

1069
01:29:54,998 --> 01:29:57,479
Come on, Dad, hurry,
 they're after us.

1070
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:06,139
Come on, Dad,
they'll get us.

1071
01:30:06,183 --> 01:30:08,403
What are you
 talking about?

1072
01:30:16,106 --> 01:30:17,760
Hurry up,
 Sundance, hurry.

1073
01:30:17,803 --> 01:30:18,500
I'm going as fast
 as I can.

1074
01:30:36,256 --> 01:30:38,650
Wow, here they come.

1075
01:30:38,694 --> 01:30:41,348
Herbie,
 I don't see anything.

1076
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:46,092
Look at 'em.
Here they come.

1077
01:30:46,832 --> 01:30:48,617
I am looking at 'em,
 but I just don't...

1078
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,357
They're getting closer.

1079
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:51,707
Yeah.

1080
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:54,536
Yeah, I see 'em, Butch.
 I see 'em.

1081
01:30:54,579 --> 01:30:55,754
Let's get out of here,
 Sundance.

1082
01:30:55,798 --> 01:30:56,886
Do you really
see 'em, Dad?

1083
01:30:56,929 --> 01:30:59,497
Yeah,
 there's five of 'em.

1084
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:02,587
Gee, Dad,
I don't see five.
I only see four.

1085
01:31:02,631 --> 01:31:04,589
No, no, no,
 the guys in the back
 are riding double.

1086
01:31:04,633 --> 01:31:06,243
Riding double?

1087
01:31:06,286 --> 01:31:08,158
Do you think
 we're gonna make it,
 Sundance?

1088
01:31:08,201 --> 01:31:09,507
Well, barely.

1089
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,640
Just barely.

1090
01:31:27,699 --> 01:31:29,222
They're really
coming.

1091
01:31:29,266 --> 01:31:31,355
I think I see Robert.

1092
01:31:31,398 --> 01:31:32,487
They're not
 slowing down.

1093
01:31:33,313 --> 01:31:34,401
They're not gonna stop.

1094
01:31:34,445 --> 01:31:36,491
Mom!
Mom, I love you.

1095
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:38,231
That's too fast
 for this road!

1096
01:31:38,275 --> 01:31:39,276
Herbie, Robert!

1097
01:31:39,319 --> 01:31:40,930
Yoo-hoo!
