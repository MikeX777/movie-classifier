00:01:18,098 --> 00:01:23,098
[radio] Yo, pull out them kiddie pools and 
call me up with your sizzling summer scandal.

00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:25,098
tomorrow's the Fourth of July

3
00:01:25,098 --> 00:01:27,868
but we're kicking off the celebration tonight

4
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:30,054
with fireworks at the marina!

5
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:32,904
It's going to be a scorcher!

00:01:48,904 --> 00:01:50,904


15
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:52,904
Yo, that's my wall!

00:02:04,904 --> 00:02:06,672


23
00:02:06,672 --> 00:02:08,672
Lights up on Washington Heights,

24
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:10,672
 up at the break of day

25
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,672
I wake up and I got this little punk I gotta chase away

26
00:02:12,672 --> 00:02:14,672
Pop the grate at the crack of dawn,

27
00:02:14,672 --> 00:02:16,672
While I wipe down the awning

28
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:18,672
Hey y’all, good morning

29
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,672
[PIRAGUA GUY]
Ice cold piragua! 

30
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:22,672
 Parcha. China. Cherry. 

31
00:02:22,672 --> 00:02:24,672
Strawberry. And just for today, 

32
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:26,672
 I got mamey!

33
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:27,996
[USNAVI, spoken] Oye, piragüero, como estas?

34
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:29,996
[PIRAGUA GUY, spoken]
Como siempre, Señor Usnavi.​

35
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:33,513
[USNAVI]
I am Usnavi and you prob’ly never heard my name

36
00:02:33,513 --> 00:02:37,513
Reports of my fame are greatly exaggerated

37
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:39,513
Exacerbated by the fact that my syntax

38
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:41,513
Is highly complicated 'cuz I emigrated

39
00:02:41,513 --> 00:02:43,513
From the single greatest little place in the Caribbean:

40
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:45,513
Dominican Republic!
I love it!

41
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:46,542


42
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,542
Jesus, I’m jealous of it

43
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,542
And beyond that
Ever since my folks passed on

44
00:02:50,542 --> 00:02:52,542
I haven’t gone back

45
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:54,542
Goddamn, I gotta get on that...

46
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:58,542
Fo! The milk has gone bad, hold up just a second

47
00:02:58,542 --> 00:03:01,542
Why is everything in this fridge warm and tepid?

48
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:04,542
I better step it up and fight the heat

49
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:07,542
'Cuz I’m not makin' any profit if the coffee isn’t light and sweet!

50
00:03:07,542 --> 00:03:08,542
[ABUELA CLAUDIA, spoken]
Ooo-oo!

51
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:11,542
[USNAVI, spoken]
Abuela, my fridge broke. I got café but no "con leche."

52
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:19,542
[ABUELA CLAUDIA, spoken]
Try my mother’s old recipe: one can of condensed milk.

53
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:20,542
[USNAVI, spoken]
Nice.​

54
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:24,542
[ABUELA CLAUDIA, spoken]
Ay! Paciencia y fe…

55
00:03:24,542 --> 00:03:26,542


56
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:29,542
[USNAVI]
That was Abuela, she’s not really my “abuela,”

57
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,542
But she practically raised me, this corner is her escuela

58
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:34,542
Now, you’re prob’ly thinkin:

59
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,542
"I’m up shit’s creek!

60
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:39,542
I've never been north of Ninety-Sixth Street!”

61
00:03:39,542 --> 00:03:41,542
Well, you must take the A Train

62
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:44,542
Even farther than Harlem to northern Manhattan and maintain

63
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:47,542
Get off at 181st, and take the escalator

64
00:03:47,542 --> 00:03:50,542
I hope you’re writing this down, I’m gonna test ya later

65
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:53,542
I’m getting tested; times are tough on this bodega

66
00:03:53,542 --> 00:03:55,542
Two months ago somebody bought Ortega’s

67
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:57,542
Our neighbors started packin’ up and pickin’ up

68
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,542
And ever since the rents went up

69
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,542
It’s gotten mad expensive
But we live with just enough

70
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,542
[COMMUNITY]
In the heights

71
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,542
I flip the lights and start my day

72
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:08,542
There are fights

73
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,542
[WOMEN]
And endless debts

74
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,542
[MEN]
And bills to pay

75
00:04:12,542 --> 00:04:16,542
[COMMUNITY]
In the Heights
I can’t survive without café

76
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:18,542
[USNAVI]
I serve café

77
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:22,542
'Cuz tonight seems like a million years away!

78
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,542
En Washington—

79
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,542
[USNAVI]
Next up to bat, the Rosarios

80
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:28,542
They run the cab company,​

81
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:30,542
They struggle in the barrio

82
00:04:30,542 --> 00:04:33,542
See, their daughter Nina’s off at college, tuition is mad steep

83
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:34,542
So they can’t sleep

84
00:04:35,542 --> 00:04:36,542
Everything they get is mad cheap!

85
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,542
[KEVIN]
Good morning, Usnavi!

86
00:04:39,542 --> 00:04:42,542
[USNAVI]
Pan caliente, café con leche!

87
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:45,542
[KEVIN]
Put twenty dollars on today’s lottery

88
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,542
[CAMILA]
One ticket, that’s it!

89
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,542
[KEVIN]
Hey! A man’s gotta dream...

90
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,542
[CAMILA]
Don’t mind him, he’s all excited

91
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,542
‘Cuz Nina flew in at 3 A.M. last night!!

92
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:57,542
[KEVIN]
Don’t look at me, this one’s been cooking all week!

93
00:04:57,542 --> 00:05:00,212
[CAMILA]
Usnavi, come over for dinner

94
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:01,939
[KEVIN/CAMILA]
There’s plenty to eat!

95
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:03,939
[DANIELA]
So then Yesenia walks in the room—

96
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:06,939
She smells sex and cheap perfume!

97
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:10,754
It smells like one of those trees
That you hang from the rear view!

98
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:15,754
It’s true! She screams, “Who’s in there with you, Julio?”

99
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:18,754
Grabs a bat and kicks in the door

100
00:05:18,754 --> 00:05:22,754
He’s in bed with José from the liquor store!

101
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:24,379
[CARLA/USNAVI]
No me diga!

102
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:26,379
[USNAVI, spoken]
Daniela and Carla, from the salon.​

103
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:28,379
[DANIELA/CARLA]
Thanks, Usnavi!

104
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,379
[USNAVI, spoken]
Sonny, you’re late.​

105
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:34,379
[SONNY, spoken]
Chillax, you know you love me.​

106
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:37,379
[USNAVI]
Me and my cousin runnin’ just another dime-a-dozen

107
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,379
Mom-and-pop stop-and-shop

108
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:42,379
And, oh my god, it’s gotten
Too darn hot, like my man Cole Porter said

109
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:45,379
People come through for a few cold waters and

110
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:48,379
A lottery ticket, just a part of the routine

111
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:51,379
Everybody’s got a job, everybody’s got a dream

112
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,379
They gossip, as I sip my coffee and smirk

113
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:55,906
The first stop as people hop to work

114
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:56,907
Bust it— I’m like:

115
00:05:56,907 --> 00:06:00,907
"One dollar, two dollars, one fifty, one sixty-nine.​

116
00:06:00,907 --> 00:06:03,907
I got it. You want a box of condoms? What kind?
That’s two quarters.​

117
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:06,907
Two quarter waters. The New York Times.​
Two quarter waters. The New York Times.​
You need a bag for that? The tax is added.​"

118
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:08,907
Once you get some practice at it

119
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:10,907
You do rapid mathematics automatically

120
00:06:10,907 --> 00:06:13,907
Sellin’ maxipads, fuzzy dice for taxicabs and practically

121
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,907
Everybody’s stressed, yes!

122
00:06:15,907 --> 00:06:17,907
But they press through the mess,​

123
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:19,907
Bounce checks and wonder what’s next

124
00:06:19,907 --> 00:06:22,907
[COMMUNITY]
In the heights
I buy my coffee and I go

125
00:06:22,907 --> 00:06:28,907
Set my sights
On only what I need to know

126
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:34,907
In the heights
Money is tight
But even so

127
00:06:34,907 --> 00:06:36,907

00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:39,907

00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:14,499
[NINA] Anytime—
<i>[BENNY] Hold up a minute, wait!    

334
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:17,499
You used to run this dispatch, right?

335
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:20,499
[NINA]
Once or twice—

336
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,499
[BENNY]
Well check the technique! Yo!

337
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:24,499
There’s a traffic accident I have to mention

338
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:27,499
At the intersection of 10th Ave and the Jacob Javitz Convention Center

339
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:29,499
And check it, don’t get stuck in the rubber-neckin’

340
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:31,499
On a Hundred-Ninety-Second, there’s a double-decker bus wreck!

341
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:34,499
Now listen up, we got a special guest!

342
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:36,499
Live and direct from a year out west!

343
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:39,499
Welcome her back, 'cause she looks mad stressed!

344
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:41,499
Nina Rosario, the barrio’s best!

345
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:47,499
Honk your horns…

346
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:53,499
She’s smiling… say hello!

347
00:18:53,499 --> 00:19:02,499
[NINA]
Hello! Everybody!

348
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:08,499
I better find my folks
Thanks for the welcome wagon

349
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:13,499
[BENNY]
Anytime. Anytime, Nina

350
00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:19,499
Wait here with me

351
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:24,499
It’s getting hot outside, turn up the A.C

352
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:28,499
Stay here with me

353
00:19:28,499 --> 00:19:31,449


354
00:19:31,449 --> 00:19:54,362


355
00:19:54,362 --> 00:19:59,728


356
00:19:59,728 --> 00:20:03,728
[USNAVI]
Oye, you missed another doctor's appointment

357
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:05,728
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
Mijo, would you take medical advice 

358
00:20:05,728 --> 00:20:08,728
from a man named Dr. Gross?

359
00:20:08,728 --> 00:20:11,728
[USNAVI]
As long as you're taking your medicine

360
00:20:11,728 --> 00:20:13,728


361
00:20:13,728 --> 00:20:15,728
Abuela...

362
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:17,728
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
It makes my heart work better,

363
00:20:17,728 --> 00:20:19,728
but in return it gives me headaches

364
00:20:19,728 --> 00:20:24,728
Imaginate, with what those pills cost,
I'd get myself a good facelift

365
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:26,728
Sácalo de aquí,
mételo pacá

366
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:29,728
Sácalo de aquí,
mételo pacá

367
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,728
Y pacá, y pacá

368
00:20:32,728 --> 00:20:36,728
[SONNY]
Who- who hooked it up?

369
00:20:36,728 --> 00:20:40,728
Ice cold Country Club Cola Champagne!

370
00:20:40,728 --> 00:20:42,728
[USNAVI]
Put that on your tab

371
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:44,728
You owe me five thousand, three hundred-

372
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:48,728
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
Usnavi, I think he's trying to tell you that 
he fixed the Frididaire

373
00:20:48,728 --> 00:20:52,728


374
00:20:52,728 --> 00:20:54,728
[SONNY]
So let's talk about that raise

375
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:56,728
Free sodas or I walk

376
00:20:56,728 --> 00:21:00,728
[USNAVI]
Half price. Diet. Cola Champagne

377
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:02,728
That's my final offer

378
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:08,728
[SONNY]
Ain't no Diminicans be drinking no diet soda!

379
00:21:08,728 --> 00:21:11,728
[VANESSA]
Be thankful, at least someone around
here is getting a raise!

380
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,728
[SONNY]
Know what? I'm starting a union

381
00:21:14,728 --> 00:21:18,728
Underage cousins of bodega workers unite

382
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:21,728


383
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:25,728
[DANIELA]
Excuse me, this isn't social hours

384
00:21:25,728 --> 00:21:27,728
[VANESSA]
Sorry, it's Con Edison.

385
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:29,728
 I gave my mom half my check to pay the bills...

386
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,728
[DANIELA]
Y que pasó? She drank it away?

387
00:21:32,728 --> 00:21:36,728
Vanessa, when are you going to get out
of that toxic environment?

388
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,728
[VANESSA]
Hi ma'am? I get my check next week, I can pay then

389
00:21:39,728 --> 00:21:41,728
Yes, I'll hold.

390
00:21:41,728 --> 00:21:46,728
Daniela, I know I still owe you from last time...

391
00:21:46,728 --> 00:21:48,728
Carla, what's my rule?

392
00:21:48,728 --> 00:21:50,728
[CARLA]
She'll do anything for you 

393
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:53,728
but she won't support your mother's malfunction

394
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:55,728
[DANIELA]
Dysfunction

395
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:57,728
[VANESSA]
My lights are going to be out all week

396
00:21:57,728 --> 00:22:00,728
[CARLA]
What would Jesus do?

397
00:22:00,728 --> 00:22:03,728
[DANIELA]
Do I look like Jesus to you?

398
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:06,728
[VANESSA]
Yes, hello? Yes, I'm still here.

399
00:22:06,728 --> 00:22:08,728
No, please don't transfer me!

400
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,728
Hello? Hello?

401
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:12,728
[DANIELA]
Comay, it's time to take five

402
00:22:12,728 --> 00:22:14,728
and clear out that negative energy!

403
00:22:14,728 --> 00:22:16,728
Get some packing tape

404
00:22:16,728 --> 00:22:18,728
[VANESSA]
Anything else while I'm at it?

405
00:22:18,728 --> 00:22:20,728
[DANIELA]
a Pepsi

406
00:22:20,728 --> 00:22:22,728
Tough love, chacha

407
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:30,983


408
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:33,983
[VANESSA]
The elevated train by my window

409
00:22:33,983 --> 00:22:38,983
Doesn’t faze me anymore

410
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:45,983
The rattling screams don’t disrupt my dreams
It’s a lullaby, in its way

411
00:22:45,983 --> 00:22:53,983
The elevated train drives everyone insane
But I don’t mind, oh no

412
00:22:53,983 --> 00:23:01,983
When I bring back boys they can’t tolerate the noise
And that’s okay, 'cause I never let them stay

413
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:11,983
And one day, I’m hoppin’ that elevated 
train and I’m riding away!

414
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:16,983
It won’t be long now!

415
00:23:16,983 --> 00:23:23,983
The boys around the way holler at me when I’m walking down the street

416
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:27,983
Their machismo pride doesn’t break my stride—

417
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:31,983
It’s a compliment, so they say

418
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:39,983
The boys around the way holler at me every day but I don’t mind, oh no

419
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:43,983
If I’m in the mood, it will not be with some dude

420
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:47,983
Who is whistling 'cause he has nothing to say

421
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:51,983
Or who’s honking at me from his Chevrolet!

422
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:59,983
And one day… I’m hoppin’ in a limousine and I’m driving away!

423
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:03,983
It won’t be long now!

424
00:24:03,983 --> 00:24:05,983
(spoken)
Ay, Usnavi, help! SOS!

425
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:11,983
[USNAVI]
Good morning, Vanessa!

426
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:16,983
If it isn’t the loveliest girl in the place...

427
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:19,983
[VANESSA]
You’ve got some schmutz on your face

428
00:24:19,983 --> 00:24:21,983
[USNAVI]
Another late night, eh?

429
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:24,983
Whoever you were with, 
he's got nothing on these biceps

430
00:24:24,983 --> 00:24:27,983
I bench press six gallons of milk
and two cases on Goya beans

431
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:30,983
[VANESSA]
It was my mom.

432
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:32,983
Actually, they shut out our lights. Again.

433
00:24:32,983 --> 00:24:37,983
[USNAVI]
Coffee, whole milk. Very sweet. Little bit of cinnamon

434
00:24:37,983 --> 00:24:39,983
[VANESSA]
Mm. Just like my abuela used to do

435
00:24:39,983 --> 00:24:40,983
[USNAVI]
That's what all the ladies say.

436
00:24:40,983 --> 00:24:42,983
I remind them of their grandma

437
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:44,983


438
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,983
[SONNY]
Good morning!

439
00:24:46,983 --> 00:24:49,983
[SONNY/USNAVI]
Good morning!

440
00:24:49,983 --> 00:24:52,983
[USNAVI]
Vanessa!

441
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:57,983
[SONNY]
Vanessa!

442
00:24:57,983 --> 00:25:00,983
[USNAVI/SONNY]
Vanessa!

443
00:25:00,983 --> 00:25:06,983
[DANIELA, spoken]
VANESSSSSAAAAAA! I’m thirsty, coño!

444
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:08,983


445
00:25:08,983 --> 00:25:12,983
[VANESSA, spoken]
Can I get a Pepsi and some packing tape?

446
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:17,983
[SONNY, spoken]
Uh, my cousin over there with his tongue hanging out,

447
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:23,983
he would like to know what a lady 
such as yourself is doing tonight?

448
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:25,983
[VANESSA, spoken]
Does your cousin dance?

449
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:29,983
[SONNY, spoken]
Like a... like a drunk Chita Rivera.​

450
00:25:29,983 --> 00:25:32,983
[VANESSA, spoken]
Okay… So after Nina’s dinner,

451
00:25:32,983 --> 00:25:36,983
we can hit a few clubs and check out the fireworks…

452
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:40,906


453
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,906
[USNAVI]
Oh snap! Who’s that?

454
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:44,906
Don’t touch me, I’m too hot! Yes!

455
00:25:44,906 --> 00:25:46,906
Qué pasó? Here I go!

456
00:25:46,906 --> 00:25:48,906
So dope! Y tu lo sabes!

457
00:25:48,906 --> 00:25:50,906
No pare sigue sigue!
Did you see me?

458
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:52,906
Freaky freakit!

459
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:55,906
What a way to begin the weekend
Sonny, anything you want is free, man!

460
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:59,906
And my dearly beloved Dominican Republic 
I haven’t forgotten you!

461
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:03,906
Gonna see this honey, make a little money
And one day I’ll hop Jet Blue!

462
00:26:03,906 --> 00:26:07,906
But until that fateful day, I’m grateful
I got a destination

463
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:11,906
I’m runnin’ to make it home
And home’s what Vanessa’s runnin’ away from!

464
00:26:11,906 --> 00:26:15,906
I’m runnin’ to make it home
And home’s what Vanessa’s runnin’ away from…

465
00:26:15,906 --> 00:26:17,906
[VANESSA]
The neighborhood salon 

466
00:26:17,906 --> 00:26:21,906
is the place
 I am working for the moment

467
00:26:21,906 --> 00:26:24,906


468
00:26:24,906 --> 00:26:28,906
As I cut their hair, ladies talk and share—

469
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:33,906
Every day, who’s doin' who and why...

470
00:26:33,906 --> 00:26:37,906
The neighborhood salon doesn’t pay me 

471
00:26:37,906 --> 00:26:42,906
what I wanna be making but I don’t mind

472
00:26:42,906 --> 00:26:48,906
As I sweep the curb I can hear those 

473
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:52,906
turbo engines blazing a trail through the sky

474
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:58,906
I look up and think about the years gone by

475
00:26:58,906 --> 00:27:09,906
But one day—I’m walkin’ to JFK and I’m gonna fly!

476
00:27:09,906 --> 00:27:14,906
It won’t be long now!

477
00:27:14,906 --> 00:27:20,906
Any day...

478
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:24,413


479
00:27:24,413 --> 00:27:32,568


480
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:52,011


481
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:57,011
[BENNY]
Roger. Cómo? Uh... dónde estás?

482
00:27:57,011 --> 00:28:00,011
Slow down. One momento.

483
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:05,011
Yo, cabrón, I'm trying to help you!

484
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:07,011
Whoa, who taught you to speak Spanish?

485
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:10,011
The drivers, dirty bastards

486
00:28:10,011 --> 00:28:12,235


487
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:14,235
[NINA]
Ahá, dime

488
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:19,235
He's going to the Cloisters,
he's stuck on the Hudson

489
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:23,235
[BENNY]
Exit fourteen, tell him to follow 
the signs to Fort Tryon

490
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,235
[NINA]
The u-turn off exit fifteen is quicker

491
00:28:25,235 --> 00:28:27,235
[BENNY]
It's also illegal

492
00:28:27,235 --> 00:28:31,235
[NINA]
Salida quince, haz una media vuelta, sigue derecho

493
00:28:31,235 --> 00:28:34,235
[BENNY]
You gave him your directions,
didn't you?

494
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:36,235
[KEVIN]
Eyes on the dispatch, por favor

495
00:28:36,235 --> 00:28:38,235
[BENNY] Yes, sir
<i>[NINA] Dad!

496
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:43,235
[KEVIN]
You look more beautiful and even smarter!

497
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:45,235
[NINA]
It must be the bags under my eyes

498
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:47,235
[CAMILA]
Nena de mamá!

499
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:50,235
Mija tan preciosa!

500
00:28:50,235 --> 00:28:53,235
Turn around, let me see my flaquita!

501
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:55,235
[NINA]
Mom! Please

502
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,235
[CAMILA]
Excuse me, you think you're all grown up?

503
00:28:57,235 --> 00:29:00,235
[NINA]
I was hoping we could grab a few coffees
and go home for a minute

504
00:29:00,235 --> 00:29:02,235
[KEVIN]
No, we're celebrating! Caridad is still serving breakfast

505
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:04,235
[NINA]
I ate at Abuela Claudia's

506
00:29:04,235 --> 00:29:06,235
[CAMILA]
So? I get to fatten you up, too!

507
00:29:06,235 --> 00:29:09,235
[KEVIN] We have to go by Daniela's
 everyone wants to see you
<i>[NINA] You guys!

508
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:13,235
[NINA]
Okay, I planned this whole speech on the plane...

509
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:15,408


510
00:29:15,408 --> 00:29:17,408
[KEVIN]
Benny, give us a minute

511
00:29:17,408 --> 00:29:20,408
[BENNY]
Nina if there's anything I can do to help

512
00:29:20,408 --> 00:29:21,408
[KEVIN]

513
00:29:21,408 --> 00:29:23,408
[CAMILA]
Mija

514
00:29:23,408 --> 00:29:25,408


515
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:29,408
[NINA]
I lost my scolarship

516
00:29:29,408 --> 00:29:31,408
[CAMILA] Did you get in some kind of trouble?
<i>[NINA] No

517
00:29:31,408 --> 00:29:33,408
[CAMILA]
It's okay

518
00:29:33,408 --> 00:29:35,408
Just tell us what happened

519
00:29:35,408 --> 00:29:37,408
[NINA]
My grades where bellow te cutoff

520
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,408
so they put me on probation

521
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:42,408
After the midterms they called me
into the Dean's office

522
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:45,408
and he was like, "We have to
pul your scholarship"

523
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,408
[CAMILA]
But you were studying nonstop!

524
00:29:47,408 --> 00:29:49,408
[NINA]
No I was working to help to pay

525
00:29:49,408 --> 00:29:51,408
for books I didn't have time to read

526
00:29:51,408 --> 00:29:55,408
Look, I ended up taking a leave of absence

527
00:29:55,408 --> 00:29:57,408
[CAMILA]
Does leave of absence mean drop out?

528
00:29:57,408 --> 00:30:00,408
Nina, look at me.

529
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:02,408


530
00:30:02,408 --> 00:30:04,408
[NINA] I guess you could say I left school
<i>[KEVIN] What?</i>

531
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:06,408
[CAMILA] Oh my god, when?
<i>[NINA] I didn't know what to do-

532
00:30:06,408 --> 00:30:08,408
When?
<i>March

533
00:30:08,408 --> 00:30:10,408
[CAMILA]
Four months ago!? Where have you been since then?

534
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,408
[NINA]
Figuring out how to tell you.

535
00:30:12,408 --> 00:30:14,408
Staying on a friend's couch

536
00:30:14,408 --> 00:30:15,408
[CAMILA]
Like a beggar?

537
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:17,408
You lied to me! Every time I called you!

538
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:22,408
[NINA]
I couldn't work two jobs and study for finals
and finish my term papers

539
00:30:22,408 --> 00:30:24,408
[KEVIN]
Two jobs? You said it was going to be one

540
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:27,408
[NINA]
It's expensive. The scholarship only covers part of it

541
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,408
[KEVIN]
Then you pick up the phone and say,
"Papy, I need some money."

542
00:30:29,408 --> 00:30:31,408
[NINA]
You don't know what college is like!

543
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:32,408
[KEVIN]
I would have found a way!

544
00:30:32,408 --> 00:30:34,408
[CAMILA]
I'm going to get started on dinner

545
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:35,408
[NINA]
Cancel tonight

546
00:30:35,408 --> 00:30:39,408
[CAMILA]
You be home in an hour!

547
00:30:39,408 --> 00:30:43,185


548
00:30:43,185 --> 00:30:45,185
[KEVIN]
Why didn't you just ask me?

549
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:47,618


550
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:49,618
[NINA]
What could you have done?

551
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:52,122


552
00:30:52,122 --> 00:30:54,122


553
00:30:54,122 --> 00:30:56,122
[KEVIN]
This isn’t happening

554
00:30:56,122 --> 00:31:00,122
Inútil! Useless

555
00:31:00,122 --> 00:31:02,688


556
00:31:02,688 --> 00:31:04,688
Just like my father was before me:

557
00:31:04,688 --> 00:31:06,688


558
00:31:06,688 --> 00:31:10,688
Inútil! Useless

559
00:31:10,688 --> 00:31:14,688
And every day
He cut the cane

560
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,688
He came home late and prayed for rain

561
00:31:17,688 --> 00:31:18,714


562
00:31:18,714 --> 00:31:20,714
Prayed for rain

563
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,397


564
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:24,397
And on the days
When nothing came

565
00:31:24,397 --> 00:31:28,397
My father’s face was lined with shame

566
00:31:28,397 --> 00:31:32,397
He’d sit me down beside him and he’d say,​

567
00:31:32,397 --> 00:31:33,134


568
00:31:33,134 --> 00:31:38,134
“My father was a farmer,​
His father was a farmer,​

569
00:31:38,134 --> 00:31:41,134
And you will be a farmer.”

570
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:45,134
But I told him,
 “Papi, I’m sorry, I’m going farther.​

571
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:51,134
I’m getting on a plane.​
And I am gonna change the world someday!”

572
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:53,134
And he slapped my face

573
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:58,134
He stood there, staring at me,

574
00:31:58,134 --> 00:32:00,134
 useless

575
00:32:00,134 --> 00:32:07,134
Today my daughter’s home and I am… 

576
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,134
 useless

577
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:11,760


578
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,760
And as a baby she amazed me 

579
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,760
with the things she learned each day

580
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:21,329


581
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:24,329
She used to stay on the fire escape

582
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:27,329
While all the other kids would play

583
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:31,329
And I would stand beside her and I’d say:

584
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:33,329
“I’m proud to be your father

585
00:32:33,329 --> 00:32:36,329
‘Cuz you work so much harder

586
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:41,329
And you are so much smarter
Than I was at your age.”

587
00:32:41,329 --> 00:32:45,329
But I always knew that she would fly away

588
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:50,329
And she was gonna change the world
someday

589
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:53,388


590
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:57,388
I will not be the reason

591
00:32:57,388 --> 00:33:01,388
That my family can’t succeed

592
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:07,388
I will do what it takes

593
00:33:07,388 --> 00:33:11,388
They’ll have everything they need

594
00:33:11,388 --> 00:33:15,388
Or all my work, all my life

595
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:22,388
Everything I’ve sacrificed will have been 
useless

01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:32,359
[USNAVI]
Let me see it again!

1507
01:21:32,359 --> 01:21:36,359
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
We kept it safe

1508
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:38,359
[USNAVI]
So we survived the night;

1509
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:41,359
What happens today?

1510
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:44,359
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
A third for you

1511
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:47,359
[USNAVI]
Uh huh, uh huh! Uh huh, uh huh!

1512
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:50,359
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
A third for me!

1513
01:21:50,359 --> 01:21:52,359
[USNAVI]
No pare! Sigue, sigue!

1514
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:57,359
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
The rest for Sonny—

1515
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:00,359
And with our share of the money

1516
01:22:00,359 --> 01:22:03,359
And with our share of the money—

1517
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:08,359
Dream of the seaside air!

1518
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:13,359
See me beside you there!

1519
01:22:13,359 --> 01:22:21,359
Think of the hundreds of stories we will share!

1520
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:24,359
You and I!

1521
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:27,359
[USNAVI/ABUELA CLAUDIA]
Ayy…

1522
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:32,359
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
Now you can sell your store!

1523
01:22:32,359 --> 01:22:37,359
Open a bar by the shore!

1524
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:42,359
I’ve told you hundreds of stories

1525
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:48,359
About home; make some more

1526
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:51,359
[USNAVI/ABUELA CLAUDIA]
More…

1527
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:54,359
[USNAVI]
Yo! I know just where to go!

1528
01:22:54,359 --> 01:22:57,359
There’s a little beach named Playa Rincón

1529
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:00,359
With no road, you need a rowboat or motorbike

1530
01:23:00,359 --> 01:23:02,359
To reach this beach, it’s just a stone’s throw
From home

1531
01:23:02,359 --> 01:23:04,359
My folks’ home

1532
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:06,359
Before I was born
Before they passed on

1533
01:23:06,359 --> 01:23:08,359
And left me on my own,

1534
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:10,359
in New York, with the grocery store

1535
01:23:10,359 --> 01:23:12,359
They would talk about home, I listened closely for

1536
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:14,359
The way they whispered to each other

1537
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:16,359
‘Bout the warmer winter weather

1538
01:23:16,359 --> 01:23:18,359
Inseparable, they even got sick together

1539
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:21,359
They never got better… passed away that December

1540
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:23,957
And left me with these memories like dyin’ embers

1541
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,957
From a dream I can’t remember…
Ever since then it’s like

1542
01:23:26,957 --> 01:23:29,346
Another day deeper in debt with different dilemmas

1543
01:23:29,346 --> 01:23:32,346
The bodega’s a mess, 
I’ll be seeing less of Vanessa

1544
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:35,346
Abuela I don’t know how I can keep it together!

1545
01:23:35,346 --> 01:23:38,374


1546
01:23:38,374 --> 01:23:43,374
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
Remember the story of your name...

1547
01:23:43,374 --> 01:23:49,374
It was engraved on a passing ship on the 
day your family came

1548
01:23:49,374 --> 01:23:53,374
Your father said “Usnavi,​

1549
01:23:53,374 --> 01:23:57,374
That’s what we’ll name the baby.”

1550
01:23:57,374 --> 01:23:58,374


1551
01:23:58,374 --> 01:24:04,374
[USNAVI]
It really said “U.S. Navy,” but hey…

1552
01:24:04,374 --> 01:24:10,374
I worked with what they gave me okay…

1553
01:24:11,374 --> 01:24:17,374
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
They’d be so proud of you today!

1554
01:24:17,374 --> 01:24:20,374
[USNAVI]
Then by the end of July

1555
01:24:20,374 --> 01:24:22,374
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
Uh huh, uh huh! Uh huh, uh huh!

1556
01:24:22,374 --> 01:24:25,374
[USNAVI]
Out where the sea meets the sky!

1557
01:24:25,374 --> 01:24:27,374
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
No pare! Sigue, sigue!

1558
01:24:27,374 --> 01:24:34,374
[USNAVI/ABUELA CLAUDIA]
Think of the hundreds of stories We’ll create

1559
01:24:34,374 --> 01:24:37,374
You and I!

1560
01:24:37,374 --> 01:24:39,374
Ay…

1561
01:24:39,374 --> 01:24:41,374
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
We’ll find your island—

1562
01:24:41,374 --> 01:24:44,374
[USNAVI]
I’ll find my island sky

1563
01:24:44,374 --> 01:24:46,374
[ABUELA CLAUDIA]
Ay, find your island—

1564
01:24:46,374 --> 01:24:49,374
[USNAVI]
But whatever we do it’s—

1565
01:24:49,374 --> 01:24:55,374
[USNAVI/ABUELA CLAUDIA]
You and I!

1566
01:24:55,446 --> 01:25:05,202


1567
01:25:05,202 --> 01:25:15,011


1568
01:25:15,011 --> 01:25:18,011
[KEVIN]
I went down to the park, nothing
Any word here?

1569
01:25:18,011 --> 01:25:21,011
[CAMILA]
Mostly voice mails,
half of people's phones are out...

1570
01:25:21,011 --> 01:25:23,011
I got to the letter M...

1571
01:25:23,011 --> 01:25:24,011


1572
01:25:24,011 --> 01:25:26,011

01:25:28,011 --> 01:25:29,011
[KEVIN]
Start talking

1575
01:25:29,011 --> 01:25:31,011
[CAMILA]
Where the hell have you been?

1576
01:25:31,011 --> 01:25:33,011
[NINA]
I should have called, I know

1577
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:35,011
[KEVIN]
Answer your mother! Where were you?

1578
01:25:35,011 --> 01:25:36,011
[BENNY]
Boss...

1579
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:38,011
[NINA]
It's okay dad

1580
01:25:38,011 --> 01:25:40,011
[BENNY]
Mr Rosario, can I have a minute?

1581
01:25:40,011 --> 01:25:41,011


1582
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:44,011
[KEVIN]
Think very hard about what you say to me

1583
01:25:44,011 --> 01:25:46,011
[NINA]
Just hear him out

1584
01:25:46,011 --> 01:25:47,011


1585
01:25:47,011 --> 01:25:49,011
[KEVIN]
Actually, no

1586
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:51,011
I'll say this nicely

1587
01:25:51,011 --> 01:25:53,011
Please stay away from my daughter

1588
01:25:53,011 --> 01:25:56,011
[BENNY]
Sir, I've worked here since I was 
practically a kid

1589
01:25:56,011 --> 01:25:58,011
You know me

1590
01:25:58,011 --> 01:26:01,594
[KEVIN]
Do you think you're anywhere CLOSE to her level?

1591
01:26:01,594 --> 01:26:03,594
[BENNY]
Of course not! Sir. No one is

1592
01:26:03,594 --> 01:26:05,594
[NINA]
Please stop calling him "sir"!

1593
01:26:05,594 --> 01:26:07,594
[KEVIN] You stay out of this!
<i>[NINA] Jesus, Dad!

1595
01:26:09,594 --> 01:26:11,594
[KEVIN]
I taught you how to drive

1596
01:26:11,594 --> 01:26:14,594
I taught you how to tie a goddamn tie!

1597
01:26:14,594 --> 01:26:18,594
[BENNY]
And now I tie the same Windsor knot
around my collar as you

1598
01:26:18,594 --> 01:26:20,594
We're not that different!

You will never be part of this family, entiendes?

[BENNY] Loud and clear
<i>[NINA] Benny!

1603
01:26:29,222 --> 01:26:33,222

Why learn the language if they

1604
01:26:33,222 --> 01:26:35,222


1605
01:26:35,222 --> 01:26:38,222

Sin vergüenza! Are you trying to shame me?

1606
01:26:38,222 --> 01:26:41,222
[NINA]
Yes, dad, that's exactly what I'm trying to do!

1607
01:26:41,222 --> 01:26:43,764
[KEVIN]
Well you've succeeded!
Congratulations, you succeed at everything- 

1608
01:26:43,764 --> 01:26:45,764
[NINA] I'm sorry I embarras you!
<i>[CAMILA] Oh, my god, enought

1609
01:26:45,764 --> 01:26:47,764
Now you listen to me…

01:26:47,764 --> 01:26:49,764
[NINA] Mom…
<i>[CAMILA] Carajo, I said enough!

<i>[CAMILA] Yapapapapa!

01:26:53,764 --> 01:26:56,764
I think you’ve said enough

1614
01:26:56,764 --> 01:26:59,764
Now listen to what I say

1615
01:26:59,764 --> 01:27:01,764
What I say goes!

1616
01:27:01,764 --> 01:27:04,764
Papi, you’ve pushed us all away

1617
01:27:04,764 --> 01:27:06,764

<i>[CAMILA] I don’t wanna hear it!</i> 

1618
01:27:06,764 --> 01:27:09,764
 We make decisions as a family

1619
01:27:09,764 --> 01:27:12,764
And throwing Benny out like that?

1620
01:27:12,764 --> 01:27:16,764
You sound just like your father!

1621
01:27:16,764 --> 01:27:18,764
We both know what a sonofabitch he was!

1622
01:27:18,764 --> 01:27:22,764
You think it all comes down to you…

1623
01:27:22,764 --> 01:27:24,764
[KEVIN]
Cami, let’s talk about it…

1624
01:27:24,764 --> 01:27:26,764
[CAMILA]
No no no no no!
No no no no no!

1625
01:27:26,764 --> 01:27:29,764
No, you don’t!
When you have a problem you come home

1626
01:27:29,764 --> 01:27:32,764
You don’t go off and make matters worse

1627
01:27:32,764 --> 01:27:34,764
on your own

1628
01:27:34,764 --> 01:27:37,764
One day you’re gonna come back home

1629
01:27:37,764 --> 01:27:42,764
And you’re not gonna find me waiting any more

1630
01:27:42,764 --> 01:27:44,764


1631
01:27:44,764 --> 01:27:46,764
[KEVIN, spoken]
I’m sorry…

1632
01:27:46,764 --> 01:27:49,764

Huh. Damn right you’re sorry.​

1633
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:51,764

<i>[CAMILA] I’m talking now!

01:27:57,764 --> 01:28:00,764
[NINA] I’m sorry—
<i>[CAMILA] Don’t apologize to me

[NINA, spoken]
What?

1639
01:28:04,764 --> 01:28:06,764
[CAMILA]
Look at your father

1640
01:28:06,764 --> 01:28:09,764
He doesn’t sleep when you’re gone

1641
01:28:09,764 --> 01:28:14,764
He’s worked his whole life to help you go farther

1642
01:28:14,764 --> 01:28:17,764
And he can’t admit when he’s wrong

1643
01:28:17,764 --> 01:28:20,764
Now who does that remind you of?

1644
01:28:20,764 --> 01:28:23,764
You two deserve each other!

1645
01:28:23,764 --> 01:28:25,764
For months you lied to us

1646
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:27,764
What did we do…

1647
01:28:27,764 --> 01:28:29,764
To make you think we wouldn’t do 

1648
01:28:29,764 --> 01:28:31,764
anything and everything for you?

1649
01:28:31,764 --> 01:28:34,764
When you have a problem, you come home

1650
01:28:34,764 --> 01:28:38,764
You don’t run off and hide from your family all alone!

1651
01:28:38,764 --> 01:28:40,764
You hear me?

1652
01:28:40,764 --> 01:28:43,764
When you have a problem, you come home

1653
01:28:43,764 --> 01:28:47,764
As long as we’re alive, you’re never on your own

1654
01:28:47,764 --> 01:28:48,764


1655
01:28:48,764 --> 01:28:51,764
Leave Benny!
Take Benny!

1656
01:28:51,764 --> 01:28:55,764
It doesn’t make any difference, 
as long as you come home!

[KEVIN, spoken] Camila—

01:28:59,378 --> 01:29:02,378
I’m done trying
And I'm leaving it up to you!

1660
01:29:02,378 --> 01:29:04,378
It’s up to you!

1661
01:29:04,378 --> 01:29:07,378
I’ll see you both back home!

[SONNY]
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. Let it, let it

1670
01:29:36,116 --> 01:29:38,116
My friend was trapped in the subway

They had to walk a mile in that

I hope you can trust me

2021

Mom,

2022
01:50:04,165 --> 01:50:07,165
I've been thinking all day about what you said,

2023
01:50:07,165 --> 01:50:09,165
what dad did

2024
01:50:09,165 --> 01:50:12,165
If you have never quit,

2025
01:50:12,165 --> 01:50:14,165
there's no way I'm going to

2026
01:50:14,165 --> 01:50:17,165
I want to go back to Stanford and finish what I started

2027

[CAMILA]
Yes?

2030
01:50:23,165 --> 01:50:26,165
[KEVIN]
I'm asking for you support on this

2031
01:50:26,165 --> 01:50:29,165

So then ask

Mrs Rosario, are we ready to sell the business?

2035
01:50:38,165 --> 01:50:40,165


2036
01:50:40,165 --> 01:50:42,165
[CAMILA]
I will never be ready

2037
01:50:42,165 --> 01:50:43,165


2038
01:50:43,165 --> 01:50:45,165
But I know it's the right time

2039
01:50:45,165 --> 01:50:46,165


2040
01:50:46,165 --> 01:50:48,165
[KEVIN]
Okay

2041
01:50:48,165 --> 01:50:51,165
Then I'll be a mechanic again if that's what it takes

2042
01:50:51,165 --> 01:50:53,165
[NINA]
How can I pay you back?

2043

When I was nine

2045
01:50:57,165 --> 01:51:00,165
I took some pieces of wood and made a box

2046
01:51:00,165 --> 01:51:03,165
I took a rag from the kitchen and an old coffee can

2047
01:51:03,165 --> 01:51:07,165
I walked down to the plaza en Arecibo
and shined shoes for a nickel

2048
01:51:07,165 --> 01:51:11,165
At the end of the day I had thirty five cents in the can

2049
01:51:11,165 --> 01:51:14,165
Did I spend it on candy?
Did I buy toys?

2050
01:51:14,165 --> 01:51:16,165
[CAMILA]
You bought shoe polish

2051
01:51:16,165 --> 01:51:20,165
[KEVIN]
Ah! I always had a mind for investments

2052

but she won't support your mother's dysfunction

It’s a wonderful life that I’ve know

02:06:40,004 --> 02:06:44,004
“Merry Christmas you ole’ Building and Loan!”
I’m home!

Abuela that ain’t a stoop, that’s your throne

2371
02:06:50,004 --> 02:06:53,004
Long after ya birds have all flown
I’m home!

2372
02:06:53,004 --> 02:06:56,004
Where the coffee’s non-stop
And I drop this hip-hop

2373
02:06:56,004 --> 02:06:58,004
In my mom and pop shop
I’m home!

2374
02:06:58,004 --> 02:07:00,004
Where people come
People go

2375
02:07:00,004 --> 02:07:01,625
Let me show all of these
People what I know

2376
02:07:01,625 --> 02:07:03,625
There’s no place like home!

2377
02:07:03,625 --> 02:07:05,625
And let me set the record straight!
I’m steppin’ to Vanessa

2378
02:07:05,625 --> 02:07:07,625
I’m gettin’ a second date
I’m home!

2379
02:07:07,625 --> 02:07:09,625
Where it’s a hundred in the shade

2380
02:07:09,625 --> 02:07:11,625
But with patience and faith
We remain 

2381
02:07:11,625 --> 02:07:13,625
unafraid
I’m home!

2382
02:07:13,625 --> 02:07:15,625
You hear that music in the air?

2383
02:07:15,625 --> 02:07:17,625
Take the train to the top of the world
And I’m there
