1
00:01:58,087 --> 00:02:00,885
We are in November 1949.

2
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:03,800
The location is in the southwest of China ...

3
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:06,566
where the Red Army has 
not taken control ... yet.

4
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:50,280
Good morning. 
I'm Father O'Banion.

5
00:02:50,327 --> 00:02:52,557
Good morning, Father. 
I'm Father Lemay.

6
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:56,441
He should have arrived a long time ago. We 
were told he would get here in a few days.

7
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:58,643
Well, I designed it, but ...

8
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:01,799
I had a very difficult trip.

9
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:06,039
To put it mildly, Father Bovard is already 
looking forward to replacing him.

10
00:03:06,127 --> 00:03:09,403
He still has a 2-day trip to 
San-Li-Wan.

11
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:12,439
I will tell Father Bovard 
how sorry I am for the delay.

12
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,916
We assumed you were traveling alone.

13
00:03:19,007 --> 00:03:22,556
I guess I should tell 
you why this girl is traveling with me.

14
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:26,887
We are very curious, yes.

15
00:03:28,487 --> 00:03:31,479
Well ... her mother has just returned ...

16
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:34,485
and very enthusiastic ...

17
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:37,801
to embrace faith ...

18
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:40,447
to learn more about Christianity.

19
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,842
You know, I 
made that unfortunate mistake ...

20
00:03:43,927 --> 00:03:49,126
that I saved this girl from 
the spring flood and ...

21
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:52,563
There really is a Chinese custom that 
says that if you save a life ...

22
00:03:52,647 --> 00:03:55,002
are you responsible for that life then?

23
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:56,918
That's a tradition.

24
00:03:57,807 --> 00:03:59,638
But ... doesn't it exaggerate a bit?

25
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:01,622
Believe me, I 
did my best,

26
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:03,342
to persuade him not to follow any further.

27
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:07,246
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I interrupted my trip three times and took it home.

28
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:10,319
The problem is that it’s faster 
than this stubborn horse.

29
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:12,238
This is extremely unusual, Father.

30
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:15,643
More unusual? 
It was a nightmare.

31
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:19,282
Anyway, for the fourth time, I 
managed to get the horse to gallop ...

32
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,005
and I forged a few miles advantage.

33
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:23,515
And then when I turned around ...

34
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,637
I turned to see him, 
he was there ...

35
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,197
a small figure in the distance.

36
00:04:29,287 --> 00:04:31,118
And then ... what do you think happened?

37
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:34,483
- I can't imagine. 
- He passed out.

38
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:40,643
What could I have done? 
I had to go back to revive him.

39
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,078
The point is, I revived it.

40
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:49,485
And I thought it 
was my duty to continue on my way ...

41
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:54,402
so I put it on the horse and I’m here 
tired and with sore feet.

42
00:04:58,127 --> 00:05:00,277
He recovered quickly.

43
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:03,200
And now you're sitting in the saddle again 
and running next to you?

44
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:05,363
Oh father, it's so beautiful here.

45
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:07,358
Why don't we stay here?

46
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:12,165
This is a very good idea. 
Please get off.

47
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:17,476
I will leave you here 
and continue my journey.

48
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:20,883
And when I’m at a safe distance, 
far from here, they can send me home.

49
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,686
At least that decision makes sense.

50
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,604
I say goodbye.

51
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:27,842
- Father, you can't leave me here alone. 
- I'm forced.

52
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:32,923
- I'm going to die. 
- Siu-Lan, you have everything for life.

53
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:36,323
If you leave without me, there will be no reason to live.

54
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:38,517
I'm going to kill myself.

55
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:40,478
You have to promise not to.

56
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:43,639
- I promise I'll. 
"It's much worse than he said."

57
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:48,399
Siu-Lan, committing suicide is a 
bad thing.

58
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:53,038
You know the difference between right and wrong, 
good and bad.

59
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:58,042
To love yourself is not good. 
Then I'm really really bad.

60
00:05:58,127 --> 00:06:01,278
Why do I feel so good 
when I'm bad?

61
00:06:02,407 --> 00:06:05,365
Siu-Lan, you are very beautiful and 
as soon as you find a nice young man ...

62
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:08,803
- You're very beautiful, too. 
"For God's sake, would you say goodbye?"

63
00:06:08,887 --> 00:06:10,718
That's exactly what I'm trying to do.

64
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:14,561
- Bye bye. 
- Father, please don't leave.

65
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:16,205
Don't leave.

66
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:18,726
Just pray that something like this 
doesn’t happen to you.

67
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:20,843
- Leave me out of this. 
- Help me.

68
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,485
Please.

69
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,798
Father, please!

70
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:30,197
Don't leave! 
Don't leave.

71
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:51,562
I...

72
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:53,586
I...

73
00:07:56,487 --> 00:08:00,162
- I'm really a priest. 
- I didn't even think he was a nun.

74
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:06,123
I assume Father O'Banion himself.

75
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,362
I see, I made you angry, Father.

76
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,638
Really? 
I'm trying to cover it up.

77
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:16,998
I'm terribly sorry I'm so late.

78
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:20,562
I wasn't waiting for your apology. 
I was waiting for you.

79
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:25,638
It was quite problematic to get here. 
I can explain ...

80
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:29,316
If you will explain how 
long it took to get here ...

81
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:31,318
then I don't want to hear it.

82
00:08:31,407 --> 00:08:33,477
I just want to go.

83
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,301
Ah-Wang.

84
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:39,607
Hurry with those suitcases.

85
00:08:42,007 --> 00:08:43,918
He goes it alone.

86
00:08:49,607 --> 00:08:51,518
Thank you, Ah-Wang.

87
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:55,439
Finally.

88
00:08:59,527 --> 00:09:02,678
- Well, I see you're ready. 
- What a brilliant observation.

89
00:09:02,727 --> 00:09:04,399
Again.

90
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:08,685
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I've been ready for six seemingly endless days and six sleepless nights ...

91
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:12,077
with a 
weak heart skipping every second beat .

92
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,960
In the last six days, I've realized I 
can't waste a minute.

93
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:19,599
You know ...

94
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:22,645
I got away after 25 years ...

95
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,803
and I better get out of here right away ...

96
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:27,077
before the red villains 
invade from the north.

97
00:09:28,447 --> 00:09:30,324
They are pushing forward very quickly.

98
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:34,195
- Did you hear? 
- Yes, this is a rumor.

99
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,960
Do you not enlighten about 
the mission?

100
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:44,921
Of course.

101
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:47,123
He is Ah-Wang, his maid and cook.

102
00:09:48,767 --> 00:09:51,759
He will show you where he will sleep and eat.

103
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:53,678
There's the chapel.

104
00:09:57,327 --> 00:09:58,919
Charming.

105
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:01,519
And there are the nuns.

106
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:05,157
Do you know some Chinese?

107
00:10:05,287 --> 00:10:07,721
Very little. 
You know, I didn't have time ...

108
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:09,877
He was so late 
that he could have learned Greek.

109
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:13,675
Well, luckily, 
some speak English.

110
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:16,058
They know as much about this mission 
as I do.

111
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,727
Forgive me. 
Damn.

112
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,603
And now, the moment I've been waiting for.

113
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:34,116
Father O'Banion, goodbye.

114
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:36,038
Until we meet again, Father.

115
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:38,846
Please, I want to leave happily.

116
00:11:08,207 --> 00:11:11,005
Father, do you want to meet Sister Teresa?

117
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:13,845
She's in the nursing home.

118
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:18,959
Yes, of course.

119
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:27,036
Sister Teresa, this is Father O'Banion.

120
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:30,477
"Father Bovard spoke of you, Father." 
- Yes.

121
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,035
I can imagine.

122
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:36,164
- Well, do we have it here? 
- A badly inflamed throat.

123
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:39,324
We try to keep 
kids healthy , but someone always gets sick.

124
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,284
How do you say "say A" in Chinese?

125
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:53,196
- Do they have penicillin? 
- Yes, but it's hard to get.

126
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:55,881
We try to 
reserve for the most serious cases.

127
00:11:55,927 --> 00:11:58,566
Sister, what's more important than a little boy?

128
00:11:58,607 --> 00:12:00,518
All right, father.

129
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:03,206
You'll be better in less than a minute, buddy.

130
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:08,197
Hey, that was a good right.

131
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:12,760
I made you a delicious rice cake.

132
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:15,918
You're an excellent cook, Ah-Wang.

133
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:18,322
Father Bovard was lucky 
to find himself.

134
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:23,282
Yes. 
But sometimes he was very angry with me.

135
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:27,240
- Why? 
- I stole church wine.

136
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:31,722
Didn't you keep it locked up?

137
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:34,002
I also stole the key.

138
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:37,516
He's good. But other than that ...

139
00:12:37,607 --> 00:12:39,802
you're a good Christian, aren't you?

140
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:42,042
Oh yes.

141
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:44,118
So if you shut down the wine ...

142
00:12:44,207 --> 00:12:46,163
i know how to steal.

143
00:12:46,247 --> 00:12:49,956
This is how I will be a good Christian in many ways.

144
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:53,363
Father Bovard said 
there was something good in everyone ...

145
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:55,039
even in me.

146
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:02,362
Communists.

147
00:13:04,647 --> 00:13:07,115
Father Bovard was arrested.

148
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:09,919
Poor Father Bovard.

149
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:20,324
I am sorry, Father, 
that your journey has been so short.

150
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:23,683
Thanks to you, I 
may never leave China.

151
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:26,804
These red devils don’t tell you 
why they brought you back.

152
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:31,118
All they do is smile at me 
and nail their gun to me.

153
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:38,480
Maybe I'll get an answer from the big boss.

154
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:43,564
- Ho-San. 
- Colonel in the Red Army.

155
00:13:48,982 --> 00:13:50,982
Ho-San.

156
00:13:51,007 --> 00:13:55,398
Are you one of those people 
and in this uniform?

157
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:58,678
I wear it with pleasure and pride, 
old man.

158
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:02,097
You are the last person in the world 
I expected to lead ...

159
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:04,960
these terrible enemies of the church.

160
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:07,766
Choose your words, foreign priest.

161
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,607
Just so you know, 
I was sent here ...

162
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:13,998
One moment, new boy. 
Are you still on duty?

163
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:15,765
Again.

164
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,560
Stay out of this. 
It's up to him and me.

165
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:22,356
Ho-San, you owe me an explanation.

166
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:26,122
How can a man with your mind ...

167
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:29,005
to get involved in this disgraceful situation?

168
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:32,915
Until you can master your language, 
I suggest we go inside.

169
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:35,925
Do you suggest? 
I demand.

170
00:15:12,967 --> 00:15:14,844
Are you feeling better, Father?

171
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:18,317
I couldn't sleep, so I came here.

172
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,244
I have encouraging news.

173
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:23,836
A sign was painted on the mission wall.

174
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:27,397
The sisters were very happy. 
Guarantees freedom of religion ...

175
00:15:27,447 --> 00:15:30,245
and that they will not disturb 
the converts.

176
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:32,243
How long?

177
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:35,524
So I do not know. I took a walk out there, 
no one stopped me.

178
00:15:37,487 --> 00:15:39,478
I am very weak...

179
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:42,035
and probably guilty of self-pity.

180
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,684
I wish the Lord had called me 
before I could see Ho-San.

181
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,717
I have a hard time believing 
he was ever a Christian.

182
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:58,196
Come here. Look.

183
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:03,200
He’s here after he was a 
minister boy at his first Mass.

184
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:05,118
He smiles because he made no mistake.

185
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:12,122
As he grew older, 
we talked for a long time that he might become a priest.

186
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:16,758
I even saw in front of me 
that one day he would take over the mission.

187
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:20,283
- Well ... 
- You don't have to say.

188
00:16:20,367 --> 00:16:22,517
He will probably take over.

189
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:26,719
It's already here ...

190
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:34,877
I shouldn't think about it.

191
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,804
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:36,887 --> 00:16:39,445
If I remember correctly, my father 
wanted to tell me when he arrived ...

193
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:42,120
difficulties in arriving here.

194
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:44,118
But I didn't have time to listen.

195
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:47,443
Well, I have time now.

196
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:51,485
Father, it has been a very difficult day.

197
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:54,206
I wouldn't burden you with my little worries.

198
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:57,767
- Good night. 
- Father.

199
00:16:57,807 --> 00:17:01,846
If you open that display case, 
you will find a bottle of rice wine.

200
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:05,966
Maybe we both sleep better 
if we take a sip of it.

201
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,639
Great idea.

202
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,165
Wait. 
What about the morning mass?

203
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:21,323
We can't eat anything after midnight.

204
00:17:22,487 --> 00:17:26,116
- What time is it? 
- I have 5 minutes in midnight.

205
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:28,476
With me in a minute.

206
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,677
Are we adjusting to my watch?

207
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:06,877
Good morning, Father.

208
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:08,923
We have a beautiful day.

209
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:11,322
What is so "beautiful beautiful"?

210
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:13,676
- Did you drink church wine? 
- He is not.

211
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:15,797
Never during the day.

212
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:19,436
What are you doing here? He doesn't cook anything 
and the table isn't ready.

213
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:22,320
I'm ready. 
I'm ready to resign.

214
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,200
- What? 
"Would you tell Father Bovard, please?"

215
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:27,277
"By the time he gets angry, I'm gone." 
-Wait a minute.

216
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,323
Why are you giving up?

217
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:31,358
Colonel Ho-San spoke to me.

218
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:33,443
He quickly understood with me 
that I better resign ...

219
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:36,803
and I will be a happy comrade 
rather than an unhappy dead Christian.

220
00:18:36,887 --> 00:18:38,559
So I...

221
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:41,563
I stayed too long.

222
00:18:41,647 --> 00:18:45,640
It seems disgusting, but 
I prayed for a rosary for Ho-San ...

223
00:18:45,727 --> 00:18:47,683
I prayed that I would not lose it completely.

224
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:49,678
You better start praying for Ah-Wang.

225
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,002
He lost him. 
He resigned.

226
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:55,875
I'm sorry, Father. But Ho-San said 
it makes him very happy.

227
00:18:55,967 --> 00:19:00,199
You little, ungrateful traitor.

228
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:03,285
Is that the only way you give up your Christian faith?

229
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:06,564
Oh, no, Father. 
I'm just changing my appearance.

230
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,320
Inside, I remain the same Christian.

231
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:12,444
Bye bye. 
I will pray for you.

232
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,279
What's in the package?

233
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:16,756
Only personal stuff.

234
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:19,156
Of course, personal belongings. 
Open up.

235
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:20,839
Open ...

236
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:27,281
I'd rather go to the happy gathering of the People's Party.

237
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:34,765
What kind of convert are I?

238
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:38,362
I lost Ho-San first, 
and now Ah-Wang.

239
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:43,805
Inside Christian Ah-Wang. 
Outward thief Ah-Wang.

240
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,560
Well, Father O'Banion, 
let's face it.

241
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:52,282
I am your pastor and I 
do not intend to be your home servant.

242
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:55,245
- Can you cook? 
- A little. Nothing special.

243
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,158
We don't need specials.

244
00:19:57,247 --> 00:19:59,317
Well, if you want to try ...

245
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,762
I 
shouldn't risk my stomach , but ...

246
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:03,684
let's see what he can do instead of Ah-Wang.

247
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:05,860
Just heat 
the canned beef ...

248
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,822
and prepare the egg powder.

249
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:11,237
I ate egg powder when I 
served in the Navy.

250
00:20:11,327 --> 00:20:13,158
Remember how to make it?

251
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:15,158
I couldn't do worse.

252
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:26,156
- I hope ... 
- Me too.

253
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,559
Not bad.

254
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:34,763
He warmed it up very well.

255
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:43,397
- What is this? 
- Scrambled eggs from egg powder.

256
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,238
Not something good, is it, Father?

257
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:02,285
Father O'Banion, he has 
surpassed the Navy.

258
00:21:02,407 --> 00:21:05,638
Why did you test on me ...? 
If you served this to someone ...

259
00:21:05,727 --> 00:21:08,480
- I do not know what to say. 
- Well, I know.

260
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:12,122
If you had arrived on time, 
I would n't have wolf-eyed this ...

261
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,362
Name it, grab it and bury it.

262
00:21:14,447 --> 00:21:16,961
- Do mine without it. 
- It took away my appetite.

263
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,281
What happens now?

264
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:04,558
Colonel Ho-San sent the children home.

265
00:22:04,647 --> 00:22:06,956
And he said he 
couldn’t provide our protection.

266
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:10,323
I think we should 
be grateful for your efforts.

267
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:13,482
We learned 
that after complete liberation ...

268
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,797
a 
period of aggression and retaliation ensues.

269
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:17,644
It's best if the sisters leave.

270
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:21,800
Now pack up, my car is in the trash 
to take you to the bus.

271
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:24,566
We only 
accept instructions from Father Bovard .

272
00:22:24,607 --> 00:22:26,757
They can only take us by force.

273
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:29,367
I admire their courage, sisters ...

274
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:31,438
but I have to think seriously.

275
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:34,439
Old man, from now on I will think.

276
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:37,087
I respect the sisters ...

277
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:39,144
but 
I may take them away by force.

278
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:43,319
Ho-San, 
you're still talking like a little boy.

279
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,358
They make my job very difficult.

280
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:49,116
And we will continue to do so.

281
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:54,318
What about your posters out there?

282
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:57,763
They guarantee that they 
will not interfere with the work of converts.

283
00:22:57,807 --> 00:23:01,197
New boy, his knowledge of their Chinese is 
very limited.

284
00:23:01,287 --> 00:23:03,926
We guarantee freedom of religion.

285
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:07,886
Educating Chinese children is 
our responsibility.

286
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:11,363
For the 
time being, the teachers of the People's Party will take over the work.

287
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:16,481
Is there anything I can do 
to make you feel even more pleasant?

288
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:19,286
Yes. 
Burn in hell.

289
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:23,158
I can't burn in your hell.

290
00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:25,203
I am no longer a believer.

291
00:23:30,487 --> 00:23:33,047
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I find this new freedom limited.

292
00:23:33,127 --> 00:23:36,278
It’s like 
being squeezed with an invisible rope.

293
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:40,161
I wonder what this "new freedom" 
will bring tomorrow.

294
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:43,006
Today is not over.

295
00:23:57,047 --> 00:24:00,039
Ho-San seized 
his horse and jeep.

296
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:03,158
This is the service instruction about it.

297
00:24:06,127 --> 00:24:08,357
I don't think we're going anywhere.

298
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,278
I wanted to go.

299
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,439
But now I can even stay.

300
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,795
Are you feeling bad, Father?

301
00:26:20,887 --> 00:26:24,004
It's just 
that my heart is no longer young.

302
00:26:26,047 --> 00:26:29,676
I haven't seen it yet, my child, 
though he speaks English.

303
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:32,884
I learned English at a school in Guangzhou.

304
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,559
Christian?

305
00:26:34,607 --> 00:26:36,757
Not yet, but I'm still learning.

306
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:38,525
Good. Good.

307
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:41,718
- Sit down, child. 
- How nice of you.

308
00:26:42,887 --> 00:26:45,321
What brought the wind so far from Guangzhou?

309
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:50,646
I followed a young man 
who had conquered my heart.

310
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:53,725
" 
Are you hoping to marry this man?" - Yes, Father.

311
00:26:53,847 --> 00:26:56,003
I think he will reciprocate his love.

312
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:02,441
He didn't admit it, 
but I know he loves it.

313
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:05,963
Then follow through 
and persuade him to admit it.

314
00:27:06,047 --> 00:27:09,437
- I'm going to pray for you. 
- Thank you, Father.

315
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:16,036
But without money, my journey was over.

316
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:20,562
Well, I can help you out a little.

317
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:23,644
Not much, just a little.

318
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,725
Father, I'm not looking for alms.

319
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:31,079
I'll just find a job somehow.

320
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,317
What a beautiful dish.

321
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:39,598
Tell me, when was the last time you ate?

322
00:27:39,687 --> 00:27:42,565
It's been a long time.

323
00:27:42,647 --> 00:27:46,435
I love to cook 
when the food is so beautiful.

324
00:27:46,527 --> 00:27:48,802
Can you cook well?

325
00:27:48,887 --> 00:27:52,880
My mom said I’m the only one 
who makes a feast out of nothing.

326
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:57,796
Well, he seems to have found himself 
a temporary job.

327
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:00,837
Thank you, Father.

328
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:03,322
My child, I just have ...

329
00:28:03,407 --> 00:28:07,525
my worst chef 
in all of busy and free China.

330
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:10,400
- Come with me. 
- Share your burden with me.

331
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:12,802
It brought light into a very dark day, my 
child.

332
00:28:12,887 --> 00:28:14,718
Mine to you.

333
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:18,117
I can't wait 
to tell the news to Father O'Banion.

334
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:19,765
Careful.

335
00:28:31,767 --> 00:28:34,327
What are you boiling now?

336
00:28:34,407 --> 00:28:36,841
- Just water. 
- Thank God.

337
00:28:36,927 --> 00:28:39,839
Well, one of my concerns has been resolved.

338
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:42,401
He will be replaced as a chef.

339
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,206
I share your relief. 
But who would take the courage ...?

340
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:53,761
Come in, my child.

341
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:57,563
Give me, let me help.

342
00:28:59,127 --> 00:29:00,355
Here you go.

343
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:05,277
Father, this is almost a miracle.

344
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:08,245
On the edge of the village, I found exactly 
who we needed.

345
00:29:08,327 --> 00:29:10,158
Heaven sent it.

346
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:12,124
Look.

347
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,726
In addition to being an excellent chef,

348
00:29:13,726 --> 00:29:16,142
you know how to 
grow herbs for my heart.

349
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:19,000
His name is Siu-Lan.

350
00:29:19,047 --> 00:29:23,882
- Yes. 
"This is Father O'Banion, my child."

351
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:34,596
Can I take off my apron? 
It doesn't suit you, Father.

352
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,763
Father, we are back to life today.

353
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:41,756
Show him where things are. 
I'll be back if I've read enough.

354
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,243
Would you help me, father?

355
00:29:49,327 --> 00:29:50,919
Do it yourself.

356
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:54,757
I'm so glad to see you.

357
00:29:54,807 --> 00:29:56,798
I'm sorry I 
ca n't say the same.

358
00:29:56,887 --> 00:30:00,800
Her lips don’t, but her eyes say 
she’s glad to see you again.

359
00:30:00,887 --> 00:30:03,276
If you want me to be happy, 
leave immediately.

360
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:05,284
He doesn't say that seriously.

361
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:08,797
Isn’t it bad for a priest to say something 
he doesn’t mean seriously?

362
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:13,403
It's alright then.

363
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:17,321
Stop my harassment. 
You can't stay here.

364
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:20,126
I'm serious. 
You have to go.

365
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:26,638
Father Bovard?

366
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:33,642
- What is it, Siu-Lan? 
- Dad said I had to go.

367
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,359
To go?

368
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:38,243
Why?

369
00:30:38,327 --> 00:30:40,887
I’ve never heard of a 
female chef on a mission.

370
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,725
Well, now you've heard of it.

371
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:46,004
It is no more unusual than we have 
female nuns.

372
00:30:46,047 --> 00:30:49,357
Father O'Banion, 
I'm leading this mission ...

373
00:30:49,407 --> 00:30:51,557
and Siu-Lan stays here.

374
00:30:51,607 --> 00:30:55,202
So I would thank you for not interfering 
and getting out of the kitchen.

375
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:56,879
Yes, father.

376
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:08,438
Go on, my child. 
The whole kitchen is yours.

377
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:10,079
Thank you, Father.

378
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:15,961
Father O'Banion, are you out of your mind?

379
00:31:16,007 --> 00:31:18,999
- It looks awful. 
- Well, I don't feel very well.

380
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,043
It's from your brew.

381
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,237
Whatever it is, I feel bad.

382
00:31:45,807 --> 00:31:48,401
What bad news did you bring now?

383
00:31:48,447 --> 00:31:51,644
I came to invite the 
old priest to hear my speech.

384
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:55,163
I will speak to the villagers. 
You will surely find it enlightening.

385
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:57,807
All right. 
"Know your enemy."

386
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:00,837
- I go. 
- Good.

387
00:32:00,927 --> 00:32:05,762
And another thing. I noticed they 
have a new person in their household.

388
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:07,286
A beautiful Chinese girl.

389
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:10,086
Since you took Ah-Wang, 
he will help you in the kitchen.

390
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:12,038
You don't understand me, old priest.

391
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:16,206
Chinese. 
That is why he is my responsibility.

392
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:19,165
With your permission, I'd talk to him.

393
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:22,963
Only if allowed.

394
00:32:25,567 --> 00:32:29,162
We didn’t even eat a regular meal 
before the devil put his foot down.

395
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:31,641
He'll send him out of here and see you.

396
00:32:32,687 --> 00:32:34,723
Well, maybe that's how it will be, Father.

397
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:36,723
You said the best?

398
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:39,321
- It was just a thought. 
- A silly thought.

399
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:43,241
It would be better if you prayed to 
leave that girl here safe with us.

400
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:49,956
I assure you that I will pray a lot.

401
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:21,640
- Do you think he's abusing him? 
- He was the one who yelled.

402
00:33:21,687 --> 00:33:23,962
Let's go and see.

403
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:27,119
- What happened? 
- An accident. Nothing.

404
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:31,679
I interviewed the girl. 
You can stay for now.

405
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:34,182
Ho-San ...

406
00:33:34,207 --> 00:33:37,438
Is it possible that 
traces of Christianity have remained in you?

407
00:33:37,487 --> 00:33:39,364
Don't insult me, old man.

408
00:33:39,447 --> 00:33:42,007
I can change my mind.

409
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:44,920
You heard him, Father. 
At least Siu-Lan can stay.

410
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,136
Yes, I heard him.

411
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:49,045
Siu-Lan, everything is taken care of. 
It can stay.

412
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,800
Thank you, Father. 
I'm very happy.

413
00:33:51,887 --> 00:33:54,879
I did not understand. 
What did Ho-San say?

414
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:56,798
He said many things.

415
00:33:56,887 --> 00:33:58,718
And he tried to court me.

416
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:02,123
That's not interesting. 
What he said?

417
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,119
He said I had to report everything the 
two of you do.

418
00:34:05,167 --> 00:34:07,681
- Everything? 
- Do not worry.

419
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:10,639
- I'll tell him good. 
- God bless you, child.

420
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:14,845
So now 
I’m a cook, a washer and a spy.

421
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,157
I feel the loop is getting tighter.

422
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:20,044
How right you are.

423
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:14,999
God bless you.

424
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:34,885
There were crowds in Ho-San’s speech, I 
wondered if anyone was here.

425
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:36,519
I'll see.

426
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:01,565
Our congregation is only from Ho-San's 
father and mother ...

427
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:03,319
and of course the sisters.

428
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:06,479
God bless them. 
And from two loyal minister boys.

429
00:36:06,567 --> 00:36:08,478
Let's start the Mass.

430
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:47,396
Are you worried about something, Father?

431
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:49,398
I'm thinking about the future.

432
00:37:50,927 --> 00:37:55,284
Do you mean Christians 
who are already afraid to come to church?

433
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:57,642
Again.

434
00:37:57,727 --> 00:38:00,685
And if they never come back?

435
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:04,840
What will happen then? 
Where are we going?

436
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:06,764
Where are we going ?!

437
00:38:06,847 --> 00:38:09,156
I will go where the bishop sends me.

438
00:38:09,247 --> 00:38:12,159
And your instruction does not apply to you.

439
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,163
I wish I could talk to your bishop.

440
00:38:14,207 --> 00:38:17,404
- I could understand him. 
- What would you understand with him?

441
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:20,763
- U.S. 
- U.S?

442
00:38:21,607 --> 00:38:25,919
Anything you could say about us could 
only be an imaginary fairy tale.

443
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:28,999
Not imaginary, beautiful.

444
00:38:29,127 --> 00:38:32,563
You are the blonde prince 
and I am the chosen one of your heart.

445
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:34,882
It is written that much torment ...

446
00:38:34,927 --> 00:38:37,521
and we will go through a storm together.

447
00:38:37,607 --> 00:38:40,724
But once the Sun emerges from the clouds ...

448
00:38:40,807 --> 00:38:43,196
and love will 
prevail over all.

449
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,120
- You're crazy. 
- Are you crazy?

450
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:48,757
- You mean, like, really crazy? 
- Yes, he's really crazy.

451
00:38:49,607 --> 00:38:51,199
Explain.

452
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:55,200
I mean, fool. 
He knows a priest can't get married.

453
00:38:55,287 --> 00:38:56,959
I made a vow. 
I swore.

454
00:38:57,047 --> 00:39:00,517
- You mean in life? 
- That's right.

455
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:03,565
Then you're crazy. 
Other foreign priests may marry.

456
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:07,396
I knew a priest 
who had two wives and six children.

457
00:39:07,487 --> 00:39:10,445
So if your first wife dies, you can 
take another one.

458
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:14,042
He is not a priest. 
He's a Protestant ... a pastor.

459
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:16,681
They have to get married.

460
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:19,717
We also have a happy ending.

461
00:39:19,807 --> 00:39:21,638
He becomes a Protestant.

462
00:39:22,647 --> 00:39:25,036
That I...?

463
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:28,237
You're ridiculous. 
I've been staying too long already.

464
00:39:28,287 --> 00:39:30,437
But ... father?

465
00:39:30,487 --> 00:39:33,445
Father O'Banion? 
Father O'Banion!

466
00:39:33,527 --> 00:39:37,918
Father! I'm sorry I hurt you. 
Please don't be angry.

467
00:39:41,207 --> 00:39:42,435
Father O'Banion?

468
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:44,961
When you’re not too busy, 
I want to talk to you.

469
00:39:45,047 --> 00:39:46,958
Yes, father.

470
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:55,243
Tones inside.

471
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:23,797
Don't play hide and seek with me.

472
00:40:24,767 --> 00:40:26,723
Come here now.

473
00:40:28,007 --> 00:40:30,077
Father, you better calm down.

474
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,516
- Because of his heart, you know. 
- Shall I calm down?

475
00:40:32,607 --> 00:40:35,246
With 
yourself who is probably hugging in the back ...

476
00:40:35,327 --> 00:40:37,363
with our beautiful young chef?

477
00:40:37,447 --> 00:40:39,517
He seemed to be stroking it.

478
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:41,638
I didn’t hug or caress her.

479
00:40:41,767 --> 00:40:43,758
I was just trying to push it aside.

480
00:40:43,847 --> 00:40:47,920
Then he put his hand 
on me and I freed myself.

481
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:51,676
- I interrupted. 
"What did you interrupt, Father?"

482
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:54,998
Anything you two ... 
That's exactly what I 'm trying to find out.

483
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:57,920
Why did you have to push him aside?

484
00:40:59,087 --> 00:41:00,918
Because of what happened in the garden.

485
00:41:01,007 --> 00:41:03,475
I was afraid of that. 
Well.

486
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,159
Kivele.

487
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,446
Do you think this is the subject of a joke?

488
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:15,443
I'm sorry, Father, but it's so tragic 
it's funny.

489
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:17,398
I'll decide.

490
00:41:17,447 --> 00:41:20,086
Tell me in a laughable, 
careless way.

491
00:41:21,127 --> 00:41:23,038
What happened in the garden?

492
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:29,478
He asked me ... to marry me.

493
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:37,283
He asked that ... 
And you agreed, of course.

494
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:40,602
And now he has come to ask for my blessing.

495
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:43,519
When will the wedding be?

496
00:41:45,207 --> 00:41:48,165
- Father, it's not time to fool around. 
- How right you are.

497
00:41:48,287 --> 00:41:50,965
He noticed that he had suddenly 
replaced the Communists,

498
00:41:50,965 --> 00:41:52,762
as my biggest problem?

499
00:41:53,487 --> 00:41:55,557
I did not encourage the girl.

500
00:41:55,607 --> 00:41:58,963
It's just a childish passion.

501
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:03,516
- That's right once. 
- Thank you.

502
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:05,956
You know, she trusted ...

503
00:42:06,007 --> 00:42:09,238
for I am a more ordinary kind of priest.

504
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:11,198
Searching unsuccessfully ...

505
00:42:11,247 --> 00:42:13,636
the man she's really in love with ...

506
00:42:13,727 --> 00:42:16,525
and he turned to himself in despair.

507
00:42:16,607 --> 00:42:18,438
Remember what I say.

508
00:42:18,527 --> 00:42:21,485
You are simply ridiculous in 
the image of the blonde prince.

509
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,559
And when he finds him, 
his problems are solved ...

510
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:27,286
and may continue the 
priestly vocation full time.

511
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:32,037
In the meantime, you may benefit 
from prayer and meditation.

512
00:42:34,047 --> 00:42:35,639
Thank you, Father.

513
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:41,802
Sri Lanka.

514
00:42:47,326 --> 00:42:48,526
Sri Lanka.

515
00:42:54,126 --> 00:42:55,426
Siu-Lan!

516
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:03,395
I'm sorry, Father, 
but Siu-Lan went to the market ...

517
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,756
and has been away for a long time.

518
00:43:05,807 --> 00:43:08,719
"You should have come back by now, I'm worried." 
- Yeah I know.

519
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:10,559
While I was praying to the Virgin Mary ...

520
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:13,658
until then he himself roared 
like a sheep, "Siu-Lan."

521
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:17,523
How do you know he didn't come back?

522
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:20,997
- He may be resting in the convent. 
- She's not in her room.

523
00:43:21,087 --> 00:43:23,043
You mean, like, 
you climbed a monastery wall?

524
00:43:23,127 --> 00:43:25,482
No, I mean I 
stood up and didn't answer.

525
00:43:25,527 --> 00:43:28,519
- Father? 
- Here's your answer.

526
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:32,685
- Come in, my child. 
- I'm sorry, but I didn't get to the market.

527
00:43:32,727 --> 00:43:35,878
Two soldiers took him to Ho-San headquarters.

528
00:43:35,967 --> 00:43:37,798
Her parents were there too.

529
00:43:37,887 --> 00:43:40,084
- Because they came to Mass? 
- Yes, Father.

530
00:43:40,847 --> 00:43:44,157
Oh, what he said was really bad.

531
00:43:44,207 --> 00:43:48,803
I had never heard a boy 
talk to his parents like this before. Not worthy of China.

532
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:51,720
Ho-San is also aware of 
the Christian commandment:

533
00:43:51,807 --> 00:43:53,638
"Respect your father and mother."

534
00:43:53,687 --> 00:43:55,723
He broke that command.

535
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:58,042
His father even burst into tears.

536
00:43:58,127 --> 00:44:00,436
Then Ho-San asked 
if I was going with the espionage.

537
00:44:00,527 --> 00:44:02,722
I told him I 
would keep my eyes open.

538
00:44:02,767 --> 00:44:06,662
He said his eyes were open too and he liked what he saw, alluding to me.

539
00:44:08,807 --> 00:44:11,844
He said he works hard 
and needs a break ...

540
00:44:12,847 --> 00:44:15,202
and asked me to rest with him.

541
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,685
Which means he broke 
another commandment.

542
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:24,395
I was really scared.

543
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,041
Then the soldiers brought in more people ...

544
00:44:27,127 --> 00:44:29,163
and Ho-San said 
we would rest at another time.

545
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:33,084
So I'm here, safe for now.

546
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:36,618
Well, that's the most important thing. 
Right?

547
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:39,797
Again.

548
00:44:39,887 --> 00:44:42,765
I'm sorry, Father. 
No food for dinner.

549
00:44:47,767 --> 00:44:50,440
Maybe it’s time to 
do a miracle.

550
00:44:50,527 --> 00:44:52,358
- That would be nice. 
- That's right.

551
00:44:52,407 --> 00:44:54,763
What if we assumed 
that it was in front of his eyes ...

552
00:44:54,847 --> 00:44:57,937
a delicious, perfectly cooked meat ...

553
00:44:58,027 --> 00:45:02,125
and as a side dish to it with tasty, 
fresh, tender vegetables?

554
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,965
- I'd say I think if I see it. 
- All right.

555
00:45:05,007 --> 00:45:06,599
Follow me.

556
00:45:08,987 --> 00:45:11,682
No no. 
On the right side.

557
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:14,600
And lift the tree.

558
00:45:14,727 --> 00:45:17,082
Say. Got it. 
Very good.

559
00:45:17,207 --> 00:45:19,767
Bring it here and put it on the table.

560
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:26,122
- Marhapörkölt. 
- Siu-Lan, tessék.

561
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:28,078
- To make it just ... 
- Leave it.

562
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:30,078
He knows how to make it.

563
00:45:31,087 --> 00:45:33,681
- Do you want me to put it back? 
- No.

564
00:45:33,767 --> 00:45:37,521
Ah-Wang knows where he is. By now, he 
had probably told the Reds.

565
00:45:37,607 --> 00:45:39,438
I need to figure out a new hiding place.

566
00:45:39,527 --> 00:45:41,438
I kept them for rainy days.

567
00:45:41,527 --> 00:45:43,722
Well, I have to say it's already raining.

568
00:45:43,847 --> 00:45:46,407
Maybe we should eat 
before they are served.

569
00:45:46,407 --> 00:45:49,205
- Yes. 
- Is there anything else in there?

570
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:52,284
Well, his brain started working.

571
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:55,120
Then I forgot. 
There are two more bottles of cognac there.

572
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:58,398
They are on the left. 
And carefully lift the tree over.

573
00:45:59,707 --> 00:46:02,880
Siu-Lan, I hope you 
don't say that in your spy report.

574
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:06,124
No, Father. 
I will eat too and I will be guilty too.

575
00:46:10,127 --> 00:46:12,595
Well, I got it.

576
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:14,842
Now I need a drink.

577
00:46:16,447 --> 00:46:18,677
- I'll open it for you. 
- No, he won't.

578
00:46:18,767 --> 00:46:20,758
Just bring a glass from the cupboard.

579
00:46:20,847 --> 00:46:24,283
- A glass? 
- A glass.

580
00:46:41,087 --> 00:46:43,317
- How is it going? 
- I think so.

581
00:46:43,407 --> 00:46:45,557
All they write is 
"Warm up and eat."

582
00:46:45,647 --> 00:46:49,720
I've never eaten beef stew before. 
Is this an American dish?

583
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,640
Well, I'm sure your taste ...

584
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,560
I'm sorry, Father. 
The bottle is open.

585
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:06,238
- Do you like cognac? 
- Oh yes. Yes.

586
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:09,478
- And what effect does it have on you? 
- Oh, I can handle it.

587
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:12,917
You can bring yourself a glass.

588
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:14,923
Well, thank you.

589
00:47:17,887 --> 00:47:20,560
Here you go. 
Spend a little for yourself.

590
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,720
Father, let's have a brighter future.

591
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:36,320
You don’t have to drink brandy for one swallow. 
It has to be tasted.

592
00:47:40,727 --> 00:47:42,046
Do you knock?

593
00:47:46,927 --> 00:47:49,725
I'm sorry I'm Turkish. 
I forget.

594
00:47:49,807 --> 00:47:51,923
It's a religious holiday ...

595
00:47:51,967 --> 00:47:55,039
or has it become their evening habit to 
drink more than they need to?

596
00:47:55,127 --> 00:47:58,244
Drink more than you need? 
I just took a sip.

597
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:09,720
Excellent old cognac.

598
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:13,476
And a whole crate of expensive canned food.

599
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:18,482
Old priest, I came to inform you 
that my parents had finally seen the light.

600
00:48:18,567 --> 00:48:20,727
And there is no doubt 
that they will join the People's Party.

601
00:48:20,727 --> 00:48:25,642
But now I know that a much 
more serious sin has been committed against the people.

602
00:48:25,687 --> 00:48:28,201
- Food concealment. 
- Food concealment?

603
00:48:28,327 --> 00:48:30,602
Father Bovard said he 
was an intelligent man.

604
00:48:30,647 --> 00:48:32,956
How can you accuse me of such nonsense? 
These canned ...

605
00:48:33,007 --> 00:48:36,443
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
I will not ignore this impudence .

606
00:48:36,487 --> 00:48:41,277
Compared to a rookie, he 
quickly collects violations on his account.

607
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:44,598
I’m glad their congregation 
doesn’t see this now.

608
00:48:44,647 --> 00:48:48,686
They drink the best cognac, 
they hide expensive food ...

609
00:48:48,727 --> 00:48:52,037
and 
he took it all on money taken from the poor .

610
00:48:52,087 --> 00:48:56,365
Old man. He lost all 
contact with the people.

611
00:48:58,487 --> 00:49:01,160
You know I did 
n't take anything from the people.

612
00:49:01,247 --> 00:49:04,000
Ever since I came here, I've just given.

613
00:49:04,087 --> 00:49:09,400
Ho-San, since you can’t find truth on 
your side, you’re just telling lies.

614
00:49:09,487 --> 00:49:11,056
Predicted lies!

615
00:49:19,527 --> 00:49:22,519
It's a shame you talked to me like that ...

616
00:49:22,607 --> 00:49:26,725
because it just proved 
he was drunk and couldn’t hide it anymore.

617
00:49:26,767 --> 00:49:30,203
For my own sake, I'll take this ...

618
00:49:30,287 --> 00:49:32,164
and this.

619
00:49:32,287 --> 00:49:33,845
Good night.

620
00:49:35,367 --> 00:49:38,439
Make sure they 
are evenly distributed among the poor.

621
00:49:39,487 --> 00:49:42,320
If you can’t figure out a striking answer, 
just go.

622
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:48,246
As the saying goes, 
"Let's share fairly."

623
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:52,802
- Thank you, Father. 
- But don't drink it for a swallow.

624
00:50:08,447 --> 00:50:10,324
It seems ready for roasting.

625
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,636
Where could Siu-Lan be?

626
00:50:13,727 --> 00:50:17,845
Don't worry about it again. 
He will be back.

627
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:20,447
I can't help it. 
With your two bottles of brandy ...

628
00:50:20,527 --> 00:50:24,645
Ho-San still decides 
it's time to ... relax.

629
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:29,485
Her concern is embarrassing.

630
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:33,725
He must have vacated an awful lot 
when he became a priest.

631
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,678
- Father. 
- Well, even in times like this ...

632
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:38,122
we must not lose our sense of humor.

633
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:44,279
I’ll make sure he’s 
really gone.

634
00:50:51,487 --> 00:50:53,796
What the hell are you doing?

635
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:01,317
He wants me to have dinner with him. I said I had 
to cook dinner for you.

636
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:05,639
That's right. I see that he is 
always the protector of the oppressed.

637
00:51:05,727 --> 00:51:07,638
- Let it go. 
- Thank you, Father.

638
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:09,917
Go, go, go.

639
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:14,325
Violence proves nothing, Ho-San. 
You better leave.

640
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:18,002
Oh yes. 
A good Christian does not want violence.

641
00:51:18,087 --> 00:51:22,478
Now we see 
how well he practices his religion.

642
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:27,644
He was taught 
to hold his other cheek there as well.

643
00:51:27,727 --> 00:51:30,241
Now the other face. 
The other cheek.

644
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:35,366
The other cheek. 
The other cheek.

645
00:51:36,607 --> 00:51:39,519
You are a good Christian.

646
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:42,923
He defended himself from Ho-San, 
but now he is not defending himself.

647
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:46,317
He has no courage to fight. 
There is no courage in it.

648
00:51:46,367 --> 00:51:48,722
A paper tiger.

649
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:15,801
Thank you, Father, for what you did for me. 
I'm so proud.

650
00:52:15,887 --> 00:52:17,798
Congratulations, Father.

651
00:52:17,887 --> 00:52:20,879
If they ever hit in 
the name of the Almighty ...

652
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:25,439
Really, father?

653
00:52:55,527 --> 00:52:57,483
Give me power.

654
00:53:09,847 --> 00:53:11,803
"Can I talk to you, Father?" 
- Come in.

655
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:19,360
It’s very disturbing what I did to Ho-San.

656
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:22,007
The more I think about the future, 
the more restless my heart is.

657
00:53:23,487 --> 00:53:25,318
I regretted being hit.

658
00:53:25,407 --> 00:53:27,557
It’s not an ordinary 
chipping in our judgment.

659
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:32,044
This is the church that resorted 
to violence against an officer in the Red Army.

660
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:34,123
But that big chip will remain.

661
00:53:34,207 --> 00:53:37,324
I said I regretted being hit. 
What else can I do?

662
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:41,165
If you consider the church to be the most important, 
perhaps you could rule yourself.

663
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,557
He had just raped Siu-Lan into the car.

664
00:53:44,607 --> 00:53:46,962
I thought it was the will of the Lord 
to stop him.

665
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:48,918
So now you are 
putting the Lord on your side?

666
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:53,995
You know what Ho-San's intentions were. 
Don’t say you support rape.

667
00:53:54,087 --> 00:53:57,636
How shrewd. 
Avoid attacking me.

668
00:53:57,687 --> 00:53:59,917
- I'm not attacking ... 
- Why did you raise your voice?

669
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:03,238
Why do you feel the need to protect 
yourself? Tell me honestly.

670
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:04,806
Why did you hit Ho-San?

671
00:54:04,847 --> 00:54:06,883
- Well ... 
- Exactly why?

672
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:11,040
In that situation 
, I would have come to protect any woman.

673
00:54:11,127 --> 00:54:14,961
But she's not just any woman, Father. 
He deviated from the subject again.

674
00:54:19,327 --> 00:54:22,637
- I lost my head. 
"Your head, Father O'Banion?"

675
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:28,639
I brought you dinner, Father Bovard.

676
00:54:28,687 --> 00:54:30,484
I can't eat now, Siu-Lan.

677
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:33,286
Not even a bite? 
She was very gorgeous.

678
00:54:33,367 --> 00:54:36,165
- No thanks. 
- Then I'll put it back in the oven.

679
00:54:36,247 --> 00:54:38,556
That when you can eat it should be hot.

680
00:54:38,647 --> 00:54:41,241
Your dinner is waiting in the dining room, Father.

681
00:54:41,287 --> 00:54:43,198
Thanks, I'm not hungry.

682
00:54:44,807 --> 00:54:47,924
Then I'll put yours back in the oven.

683
00:54:49,567 --> 00:54:52,206
Are you mad at me, Father?

684
00:54:52,287 --> 00:54:55,324
- No, of course not. 
- Well.

685
00:54:55,407 --> 00:54:58,638
I am so grateful for 
what you did for me. You are my hero.

686
00:55:06,767 --> 00:55:08,758
Do you think I enjoy this?

687
00:55:08,807 --> 00:55:10,287
Believe me, I wish with all my heart

688
00:55:10,288 --> 00:55:12,086
that I wish I had 
already returned to the United States.

689
00:55:12,087 --> 00:55:13,764
Believe me, I wish the same.

690
00:55:13,847 --> 00:55:16,520
But since I'm here, would you be patient with me?

691
00:55:16,607 --> 00:55:19,161
Allow me to solve 
my problems with the help of the Almighty.

692
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:22,000
I would assure you of this if I thought 
the Almighty would help you.

693
00:55:22,007 --> 00:55:24,237
So I'm allied with the devil now?

694
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:26,927
Really? 
What an interesting thought.

695
00:55:27,047 --> 00:55:29,402
Your own thought.

696
00:55:29,487 --> 00:55:32,365
Father, I wish you would stop 
counting the words.

697
00:55:34,807 --> 00:55:37,082
It's me again.

698
00:55:40,007 --> 00:55:42,316
I brought this bell for you, Father Bovard.

699
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:45,120
If you are ready for dinner, 
please ring.

700
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:47,323
I don't think 
I'm going to eat tonight, Siu-Lan.

701
00:55:47,407 --> 00:55:50,240
No need to hurry. 
I look forward to it.

702
00:55:52,527 --> 00:55:56,042
I put a bell 
next to your bed, Father.

703
00:55:56,127 --> 00:55:57,685
How considerate of himself.

704
00:56:01,407 --> 00:56:03,682
Well, come on, say it.

705
00:56:03,767 --> 00:56:07,476
No. I'd rather hear from you.

706
00:56:07,527 --> 00:56:09,677
You brought him here.

707
00:57:33,927 --> 00:57:35,280
Why aren't you in bed?

708
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:40,918
I'm worried about Father Bovard ... too.

709
00:57:46,487 --> 00:57:49,126
Well, he went through a lot. 
He must have fallen asleep already.

710
00:57:49,207 --> 00:57:51,801
You don't have to stay.

711
00:57:51,887 --> 00:57:53,445
Don't you need anything?

712
00:57:54,767 --> 00:57:56,120
I do not need anything.

713
00:57:57,887 --> 00:57:59,142
For nothing?

714
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:03,158
For nothing.

715
00:58:07,207 --> 00:58:09,516
I want to meditate alone.

716
00:58:09,607 --> 00:58:11,962
The moonlight is amazing.

717
00:58:14,447 --> 00:58:17,166
Maybe we could meditate together. If?

718
00:58:19,407 --> 00:58:22,001
I want to meditate alone.

719
00:58:24,087 --> 00:58:26,601
- Good night. 
- Good night.

720
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:34,836
Well, good night.

721
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:38,205
Good night, Father.

722
00:59:03,927 --> 00:59:05,918
Did you ring, Father?

723
00:59:10,087 --> 00:59:12,078
I didn't ring.

724
00:59:12,167 --> 00:59:13,566
I thought I heard the bell.

725
00:59:14,687 --> 00:59:16,678
You know very well that I didn't ring.

726
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:21,325
Maybe my 
heart echoed in my ear .

727
00:59:23,847 --> 00:59:27,078
He was so brave today. You are the 
greatest of all men.

728
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:30,682
"I'm more in love now 
than ever." - Stop!

729
00:59:31,407 --> 00:59:33,557
Now more ...

730
00:59:33,607 --> 00:59:36,485
I owe you more than ever.

731
00:59:36,567 --> 00:59:39,479
What can I do for you, Father?

732
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:43,845
Just one thing you 
could leave me alone, fast.

733
00:59:45,887 --> 00:59:47,479
As you wish.

734
00:59:51,487 --> 00:59:55,480
- Aren't you going to change your mind? 
- Go.

735
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:22,327
- What are you doing here? Get out of here. 
- I knew it was going to ring.

736
01:01:22,327 --> 01:01:25,000
I didn't ring. It was a coincidence. 
The bell fell off the table.

737
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:28,881
But this is not true. 
He rang and then turned off the lamp.

738
01:01:28,967 --> 01:01:31,800
No no no. It was a coincidence. 
It's on the ground. Get out of here now!

739
01:01:31,887 --> 01:01:34,526
- I do not see. 
He must have rolled under the bed.

740
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:36,285
- Get out. 
- I'll find you.

741
01:01:36,327 --> 01:01:40,081
- You shouldn't ... 
- Father O'Banion, are you awake?

742
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:43,361
Again.

743
01:01:49,687 --> 01:01:53,805
- What went out the window? 
- We? What?

744
01:01:53,847 --> 01:01:56,236
That's exactly what I'm asking you.

745
01:01:56,327 --> 01:01:58,238
What went out the window?

746
01:02:00,047 --> 01:02:03,926
- It could have been a bat. 
- A bat? In slippers?

747
01:02:06,207 --> 01:02:09,597
Father, you know without your glasses 
your vision is a bit blurry.

748
01:02:09,687 --> 01:02:12,884
It's not so vague. 
Why did you hesitate?

749
01:02:12,927 --> 01:02:15,316
Couldn't decide if he was awake?

750
01:02:16,727 --> 01:02:18,285
I was awake.

751
01:02:21,047 --> 01:02:23,356
Forgive me, Father.

752
01:02:23,447 --> 01:02:26,723
I didn’t come to help, but I heard you. 
I'm a spy, as you know.

753
01:02:26,767 --> 01:02:29,804
You must not 
think badly of Father O'Banion.

754
01:02:29,847 --> 01:02:32,407
- I'm trying not to think. 
- I heard the bell.

755
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:35,479
And I came to ask what 
he wanted, and he said that ...

756
01:02:35,527 --> 01:02:40,123
the bell fell off the table as 
he turned off the lamp.

757
01:02:40,167 --> 01:02:43,079
I see it from here. I'll pick it up.

758
01:02:45,767 --> 01:02:48,725
- Do you see? 
- Yes, it's clear.

759
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:53,039
- It's clear. "Go to your room immediately, you 
little bat."

760
01:02:53,087 --> 01:02:54,679
Yes, father.

761
01:02:57,047 --> 01:02:59,322
And 
use the door for variety .

762
01:03:00,687 --> 01:03:02,279
Yes, father.

763
01:03:07,807 --> 01:03:09,843
How could Father O'Banion?

764
01:03:09,927 --> 01:03:13,283
In my long life, 
I didn’t know a person like you.

765
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:16,165
It added a new dimension to the priestly vocation.

766
01:03:38,687 --> 01:03:40,598
Sisters, did you see ...?

767
01:03:41,687 --> 01:03:44,281
- Father Bovard, you should rest. 
- That's what we said.

768
01:03:44,367 --> 01:03:47,007
- But he's not listening to us. 
- We can do the garden work too.

769
01:03:47,007 --> 01:03:50,158
So should I rest? 
In addition to a million and a problem?

770
01:03:51,767 --> 01:03:55,680
And speaking of problems, sisters, 
if they did, they would leave us alone ...

771
01:03:55,767 --> 01:03:57,997
i think i can solve one now.

772
01:03:58,087 --> 01:04:00,396
As you wish, Father.

773
01:04:06,727 --> 01:04:11,357
Father O'Banion, before further embarrassing 
his own name and his church ...

774
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:13,039
Siu-Lan has to go.

775
01:04:14,647 --> 01:04:17,957
I agree with you. 
We have to send it.

776
01:04:18,047 --> 01:04:22,802
I wish I could be absolutely convinced 
that the desire he felt for me was bad.

777
01:04:22,887 --> 01:04:26,675
- I thought I might have made some 
progress, but ... - Progress?

778
01:04:26,767 --> 01:04:29,156
The last time he was in his room.

779
01:04:29,247 --> 01:04:32,762
If I hadn't intervened, 
where would they have gone from there?

780
01:04:32,847 --> 01:04:37,443
Father O'Banion, I have 
a question.

781
01:04:37,527 --> 01:04:41,566
When Siu-Lan came here, he said 
he was looking for the man he was in love with.

782
01:04:43,367 --> 01:04:45,483
Did you find him?

783
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:48,359
Again.

784
01:04:50,007 --> 01:04:51,918
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

785
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:54,925
So I prayed 
that he would come with you.

786
01:04:54,967 --> 01:04:59,199
You have to go now. It's in the garden. 
Go and tell me right away.

787
01:04:59,247 --> 01:05:00,839
Yes, father.

788
01:05:15,647 --> 01:05:17,160
- Good morning. 
- Good morning.

789
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:21,206
I picked up a few flowers on the table to 
decorate for the reheated dinner.

790
01:05:21,287 --> 01:05:24,563
It 
will look like a fresh breakfast with beautiful flowers .

791
01:05:24,647 --> 01:05:26,239
Please, sit down.

792
01:05:30,942 --> 01:05:32,242
Sri Lanka ...

793
01:05:33,067 --> 01:05:35,803
I thought very seriously.

794
01:05:35,847 --> 01:05:38,236
- About us? 
- Yes.

795
01:05:38,287 --> 01:05:40,755
And?

796
01:05:40,807 --> 01:05:43,082
You must leave the mission.

797
01:05:45,687 --> 01:05:47,962
You mean, it's time to say goodbye?

798
01:05:49,247 --> 01:05:50,839
Forever?

799
01:05:52,487 --> 01:05:56,685
But you can’t say it seriously, 
knowing that I love you with all my heart.

800
01:05:56,727 --> 01:06:00,197
If you consider me so important, 
never say that again.

801
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:03,460
- But you ... - Promise me you'll never 
tell me that again.

802
01:06:10,727 --> 01:06:12,285
All right, father.

803
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:16,679
I promise...

804
01:06:18,647 --> 01:06:20,558
i will never say ...

805
01:06:21,687 --> 01:06:24,565
that "I love you" again.

806
01:06:26,487 --> 01:06:29,638
But it will always go through my thoughts ...

807
01:06:29,687 --> 01:06:32,201
and in my dreams.

808
01:06:32,327 --> 01:06:35,444
You can't protect yourself from my dreams.

809
01:06:35,527 --> 01:06:37,802
From those beautiful dreams.

810
01:06:37,887 --> 01:06:39,923
That proves you have to go.

811
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:46,802
I know it's hard to say goodbye.

812
01:06:46,847 --> 01:06:50,522
- Cruel. 
- Maybe, but that's the only solution.

813
01:06:52,807 --> 01:06:54,877
But I will always remember ...

814
01:06:56,407 --> 01:06:58,318
Goodbye, Siu-Lan.

815
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:06,042
- Father, I can't leave. 
- You have to.

816
01:07:06,127 --> 01:07:07,402
Make a note of my words.

817
01:07:07,426 --> 01:07:10,026
On the next bus that comes through this, you 
will be on it.

818
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:12,285
I'm going to get off it.

819
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:43,878
Father Bovard, I can't say a word. 
All our work is in ruins.

820
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:47,004
They demolish the chapel and 
take everything out of school.

821
01:07:47,087 --> 01:07:50,397
- Maybe if they protested at Ho-San ... 
- That might help.

822
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:53,240
No. 
It would just deliver more.

823
01:07:53,327 --> 01:07:56,717
I'm sorry, sisters, 
but they can't prevent this.

824
01:07:58,767 --> 01:08:00,359
The nurse.

825
01:08:14,447 --> 01:08:17,086
Our medicines were believed to 
be consecrated water.

826
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:20,039
Everything was destroyed, 
including penicillin.

827
01:08:20,087 --> 01:08:23,636
They are now spreading diseases 
along with their propaganda.

828
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:26,860
Oh, no.

829
01:08:59,087 --> 01:09:01,237
Act fast, Ho-San.

830
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:05,445
My comrades were enthusiastic and went 
beyond my instructions.

831
01:09:05,527 --> 01:09:07,119
For sure.

832
01:09:10,767 --> 01:09:13,327
I 
ordered some changes in the chapel.

833
01:09:13,407 --> 01:09:15,443
Do you want to watch it?

834
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:25,601
From now on, it will be a 
meeting place for the leaders of the People's Party .

835
01:09:26,582 --> 01:09:28,582
Ho-San ...

836
01:09:28,607 --> 01:09:31,519
We have prayed many times together in this place.

837
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:36,043
Why you did this 
with this consecrated chapel ...

838
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:40,040
maybe God 
will be merciful to your miserable soul.

839
01:09:46,567 --> 01:09:49,718
Knowing his worries, 
his heart was still beating.

840
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:59,718
"Can I do anything, Father?" 
- Nothing.

841
01:10:03,087 --> 01:10:05,362
Ho-San holds a meeting in the chapel.

842
01:10:05,447 --> 01:10:07,836
I think you better not mind 
until you leave.

843
01:10:07,967 --> 01:10:11,198
- Thank you. It will be. 
- Good night.

844
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:33,764
He's still breathing.

845
01:11:33,807 --> 01:11:36,042
Thanks to sleeping pills, you 
don't know you're here.

846
01:11:36,047 --> 01:11:39,835
Do you have any plans for us to do it tonight 
or tomorrow?

847
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:42,720
I no longer trust priests.

848
01:12:26,222 --> 01:12:27,622
Father!

849
01:12:28,246 --> 01:12:29,446
Father!

850
01:12:33,322 --> 01:12:34,522
Ho-San!

851
01:12:34,747 --> 01:12:36,022
Stop!

852
01:12:36,046 --> 01:12:37,046
Ho-San!

853
01:13:04,247 --> 01:13:05,839
Dissolve it.

854
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:07,844
- Father. 
- He didn't sin.

855
01:14:07,927 --> 01:14:10,077
It was unintentional.

856
01:14:11,127 --> 01:14:13,641
I can no longer 
serve you with innocence.

857
01:14:17,287 --> 01:14:18,879
I was hoping ...

858
01:14:24,287 --> 01:14:26,482
I'm going home now.

859
01:14:26,527 --> 01:14:28,119
Oh, my father!

860
01:14:30,443 --> 01:14:31,743
Father!

861
01:14:39,807 --> 01:14:41,843
I brought you some herbal tea.

862
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,636
It will do good to your heart.

863
01:14:45,727 --> 01:14:47,126
Thanks.

864
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:51,922
And I wrote down how to make it 
when I’m no longer here.

865
01:14:54,047 --> 01:14:58,165
My child, I don't know 
how well Father O'Banion expressed himself ...

866
01:14:58,207 --> 01:15:00,846
but you have to go.

867
01:15:02,327 --> 01:15:06,081
And remember, 
everything happens for the best.

868
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:08,476
But, Father, if you could ...

869
01:15:08,527 --> 01:15:09,960
My child ...

870
01:15:11,087 --> 01:15:13,885
i am much older and wiser.

871
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:15,798
And you are so young.

872
01:15:20,847 --> 01:15:23,281
Father, I have just comforted Siu-Lan.

873
01:15:23,407 --> 01:15:25,563
He seems 
very upset for no reason .

874
01:15:26,807 --> 01:15:30,800
I’m sorry I have to be strict, 
but I have no choice.

875
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:32,782
Sri Lanka ...

876
01:15:33,107 --> 01:15:36,440
One day, with a smile, he 
will remember it all.

877
01:15:38,727 --> 01:15:40,319
Yes, father.

878
01:15:44,807 --> 01:15:48,800
Then you are a great help. 
Why didn't you help me comfort me?

879
01:15:48,887 --> 01:15:50,718
I thought he had said enough.

880
01:15:50,807 --> 01:15:55,119
It seems to be as 
difficult for him as it is for him.

881
01:15:55,247 --> 01:15:57,078
I know divorce is hard ...

882
01:15:57,167 --> 01:15:59,397
but after what happened, 
Father O'Banion, this ...

883
01:16:12,127 --> 01:16:15,836
- Ho-San is calling us. - Tell me you 
're sick. I'm going alone.

884
01:16:21,007 --> 01:16:23,475
- He wants both of us. 
- Why don't you leave me alone?

885
01:16:29,727 --> 01:16:32,958
My glasses. 
My only glasses.

886
01:16:34,887 --> 01:16:37,447
I won't be able to read now.

887
01:16:40,967 --> 01:16:44,277
I will be happy to read it to you 
whenever you wish, Father.

888
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:45,959
Thanks.

889
01:16:46,927 --> 01:16:49,395
In the meantime, we better 
find out what Ho-San wants ...

890
01:16:49,527 --> 01:16:52,678
otherwise, it may be that St. Peter 
will read it to both of us.

891
01:16:52,727 --> 01:16:54,319
Again.

892
01:17:14,422 --> 01:17:16,422
Uh, Ho-San ...

893
01:17:16,447 --> 01:17:18,039
Sick.

894
01:17:19,447 --> 01:17:21,836
Well, at least he suffers in a luxurious environment.

895
01:17:21,927 --> 01:17:23,804
What's wrong?

896
01:17:23,887 --> 01:17:25,764
Something serious, I hope.

897
01:17:26,807 --> 01:17:30,482
A knife was stabbed in me ... in my back.

898
01:17:31,727 --> 01:17:36,437
Who would do that to a 
person as lovable as you?

899
01:17:39,207 --> 01:17:41,243
That's my business.

900
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:49,557
But I can assure you that the perpetrator 
will receive the punishment he deserves.

901
01:17:52,087 --> 01:17:53,998
That's why I called myself ...

902
01:17:55,127 --> 01:17:56,879
because the wound became infected.

903
01:17:56,967 --> 01:17:58,923
Good. Good.

904
01:17:59,887 --> 01:18:01,684
That's not funny, old man!

905
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:05,806
I may be old and I’m not funny, 
but now it looks like I’m going to survive you.

906
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:08,236
Quiet!

907
01:18:08,327 --> 01:18:10,887
Have a fever. 
40 degrees.

908
01:18:10,967 --> 01:18:15,802
Yes, 41 degrees would be enough already.

909
01:18:15,887 --> 01:18:18,401
Your doctor can 
be sure to treat the infection.

910
01:18:18,487 --> 01:18:22,162
You do not currently have the right medicine.

911
01:18:22,847 --> 01:18:24,758
What a coincidence.

912
01:18:24,887 --> 01:18:26,718
You need penicillin ...

913
01:18:26,807 --> 01:18:29,958
and the enlightened comrades 
destroyed our supply.

914
01:18:31,767 --> 01:18:35,237
In what other mission is penicillin?

915
01:18:35,287 --> 01:18:36,879
And why should we tell?

916
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:40,105
Because that...

917
01:18:41,727 --> 01:18:46,278
their foolish religion does not allow 
a man to die.

918
01:18:46,367 --> 01:18:48,597
Well, at least that's what you remember.

919
01:18:50,087 --> 01:18:51,805
All right.

920
01:18:51,887 --> 01:18:55,926
Penicillin must be found at 
the Lao-Cham converts ...

921
01:18:56,007 --> 01:18:58,840
if your comrades have 
not yet taken on the mission ...

922
01:18:58,927 --> 01:19:01,282
and destroyed the life-saving medicine.

923
01:19:03,007 --> 01:19:06,886
We have not yet released Lao-Cham.

924
01:19:06,927 --> 01:19:08,883
How unfortunate.

925
01:19:10,367 --> 01:19:13,245
Well, we have nothing to do ...

926
01:19:13,287 --> 01:19:16,438
just wait for the end.

927
01:19:16,739 --> 01:19:18,342
Ho-San ...

928
01:19:18,367 --> 01:19:20,487
I can go on a mission to Lao-Cham 
if you give me permission to

929
01:19:20,487 --> 01:19:22,717
to go through 
communist territory.

930
01:19:24,127 --> 01:19:27,836
- And why would you do that? 
"In return for Father Bovard's freedom."

931
01:19:27,927 --> 01:19:30,157
I take it with me and 
come back alone with penicillin.

932
01:19:30,287 --> 01:19:33,836
No. 
Don't bargain with this devil.

933
01:19:36,847 --> 01:19:39,202
- I accept your offer. 
- Well.

934
01:19:41,327 --> 01:19:44,717
But with just one change.

935
01:19:44,767 --> 01:19:48,362
Leave the old man here 
until he gets back.

936
01:19:49,927 --> 01:19:53,397
- Then he will be released. 
- What security do you give him?

937
01:19:54,647 --> 01:19:55,841
I give it my word.

938
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:01,280
And I give my word for that too ...

939
01:20:01,367 --> 01:20:03,562
if he doesn't come back ...

940
01:20:07,047 --> 01:20:08,844
he will be killed.

941
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:12,240
Take the necessary action.

942
01:20:12,327 --> 01:20:13,919
I'm leaving immediately.

943
01:20:15,367 --> 01:20:16,800
Father?

944
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:20,559
Bye bye. 
And don't come back.

945
01:20:22,047 --> 01:20:23,116
Please.

946
01:20:25,847 --> 01:20:28,077
Then at least drive slowly.

947
01:20:42,487 --> 01:20:45,797
I will be ill from these many shocks.

948
01:20:45,887 --> 01:20:47,798
Can I get out of here now?

949
01:20:48,847 --> 01:20:51,077
I think so now.

950
01:20:58,647 --> 01:21:01,957
Will he get medicine to 
make Ho-San heal?

951
01:21:05,127 --> 01:21:08,437
Is this called 
evil to be reciprocated by good?

952
01:21:08,527 --> 01:21:10,597
Something like that.

953
01:21:10,727 --> 01:21:12,604
Then I would never be a good Christian.

954
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:17,200
I wish I had dug that knife deeper.

955
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:20,557
Siu-Lan, you should go beyond 
this bitterness.

956
01:21:22,647 --> 01:21:24,956
But I wish he was dead.

957
01:21:35,087 --> 01:21:38,045
That bus goes to your home.

958
01:21:58,447 --> 01:22:01,166
I never thought 
it would end that way.

959
01:22:03,647 --> 01:22:06,844
She will be home 
safely with her parents soon .

960
01:22:08,767 --> 01:22:11,561
That should be enough for the trip.

961
01:22:14,807 --> 01:22:17,605
- If I could just stay. 
- Please.

962
01:22:17,687 --> 01:22:19,279
Enough of this.

963
01:22:23,207 --> 01:22:24,799
Father?

964
01:22:25,967 --> 01:22:29,039
There is a word in another language ...

965
01:22:29,087 --> 01:22:32,045
which sounds sadder than "goodbye"?

966
01:22:36,322 --> 01:22:37,622
No.

967
01:22:39,047 --> 01:22:41,277
But you have to be sad.

968
01:22:42,727 --> 01:22:45,036
Siu-Lan, I wish you well ...

969
01:22:45,087 --> 01:22:47,726
and happiness.

970
01:22:53,207 --> 01:22:55,402
Maybe you don't have a little photo?

971
01:22:55,447 --> 01:22:57,039
No.

972
01:22:59,367 --> 01:23:00,959
Oh, it's okay.

973
01:23:02,287 --> 01:23:04,676
I will always remember your face.

974
01:23:08,327 --> 01:23:11,319
Will you forget my face, Father?

975
01:23:11,367 --> 01:23:13,039
Of course not.

976
01:23:14,927 --> 01:23:19,603
I know I promised 
not to express my feelings.

977
01:23:21,727 --> 01:23:24,446
Would you tell me how you feel?

978
01:23:28,567 --> 01:23:31,400
Say something 
I can remember forever.

979
01:23:33,087 --> 01:23:35,237
Something I can keep forever.

980
01:23:38,807 --> 01:23:41,605
What would you say if you weren't a priest?

981
01:23:47,327 --> 01:23:49,795
I would answer this:

982
01:23:52,767 --> 01:23:55,884
I will never think of myself again ...

983
01:23:57,807 --> 01:24:00,177
as far as I do at the moment.

984
01:24:03,127 --> 01:24:05,766
Can I take comfort in this?

985
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:08,162
Again.

986
01:24:12,767 --> 01:24:14,678
The bus is here.

987
01:24:19,807 --> 01:24:22,685
Goodbye, my good friend ...

988
01:24:24,487 --> 01:24:26,079
Father O'Banion.

989
01:24:30,127 --> 01:24:32,197
Bye bye.

990
01:24:32,287 --> 01:24:34,005
Goodbye my friend.

991
01:24:48,567 --> 01:24:50,523
I will always remember ...

992
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:01,926
I've been waiting for you.

993
01:26:01,967 --> 01:26:04,765
Greetings in the cellar.

994
01:26:04,847 --> 01:26:08,876
Father, I'm afraid 
Ho-San won't let go.

995
01:26:10,567 --> 01:26:13,445
This is nothing new to me.

996
01:26:13,487 --> 01:26:17,446
The next day after he left, he 
liquidated the entire mission.

997
01:26:18,847 --> 01:26:20,883
I heard he was now a military barracks.

998
01:26:20,927 --> 01:26:23,236
What happened to the nurses?

999
01:26:23,287 --> 01:26:25,847
They were deported from the occupied territory.

1000
01:26:27,287 --> 01:26:29,642
The Chinese sisters were 
sent back to their village.

1001
01:26:39,167 --> 01:26:41,476
It is forbidden to lean against the wall.

1002
01:26:47,567 --> 01:26:49,523
Of course, he got penicillin.

1003
01:26:49,567 --> 01:26:51,159
Ho-San's condition is already improving.

1004
01:26:52,647 --> 01:26:54,922
In moments, you will 
feel better than I do.

1005
01:26:57,247 --> 01:27:01,042
And as a reward, he’ll let 
you rot with me here.

1006
01:27:01,927 --> 01:27:03,565
I partly blame myself, Father.

1007
01:27:03,647 --> 01:27:06,923
Why? You kept his word.

1008
01:27:06,967 --> 01:27:09,542
I did more 
than keep my word.

1009
01:27:09,543 --> 01:27:11,102
I...

1010
01:27:11,127 --> 01:27:13,766
I smuggled Siu-Lan out of 
the mission area.

1011
01:27:13,847 --> 01:27:18,523
Did you smuggle it? 
But he could have left freely.

1012
01:27:20,087 --> 01:27:22,557
Or did he just want the pleasure of 
being in his company?

1013
01:27:23,127 --> 01:27:26,005
I took her to a bus that will take her home.

1014
01:27:26,087 --> 01:27:28,078
He was in great danger because of Ho-San.

1015
01:27:29,247 --> 01:27:31,715
- I do not understand. 
- Well ...

1016
01:27:34,347 --> 01:27:35,402
Forget it.

1017
01:27:35,487 --> 01:27:38,718
So the blonde prince 
saved the girl again .

1018
01:27:42,687 --> 01:27:45,076
Well, at least he's not a part of his life.

1019
01:27:46,847 --> 01:27:49,202
Unless he promised to write to him.

1020
01:28:29,767 --> 01:28:32,998
The two of you look worse and worse 
every time I see you.

1021
01:28:33,087 --> 01:28:36,523
They don't even know how sorry I am 
that these months full of suffering ...

1022
01:28:36,607 --> 01:28:40,202
they would have been avoided 
if these confessions had been signed.

1023
01:28:40,287 --> 01:28:42,881
My confession seems thicker.

1024
01:28:42,927 --> 01:28:45,680
What have you added 
since you were thrown in jail?

1025
01:28:45,727 --> 01:28:48,161
Probably hiding lice.

1026
01:28:49,367 --> 01:28:51,005
They act like fools.

1027
01:28:51,087 --> 01:28:53,043
We act like Christians.

1028
01:28:53,087 --> 01:28:57,205
Christians? 
They are intentionally committing a deadly sin.

1029
01:28:57,247 --> 01:28:58,839
Suicide.

1030
01:28:58,927 --> 01:29:02,442
But I'm sorry 
they won't have a chance,

1031
01:29:02,527 --> 01:29:05,121
to continue to torture themselves.

1032
01:29:05,167 --> 01:29:09,604
The superior will soon arrive from Beijing.

1033
01:29:09,687 --> 01:29:11,518
And then they won't have an easy time.

1034
01:29:11,647 --> 01:29:13,922
We miss the easy life.

1035
01:29:13,967 --> 01:29:16,322
I am sure about that.

1036
01:29:16,407 --> 01:29:19,717
That man is not blessed 
with my patience.

1037
01:29:19,807 --> 01:29:21,684
They have their own methods of persuasion.

1038
01:29:21,727 --> 01:29:24,036
Like pulling out your nails?

1039
01:29:24,847 --> 01:29:27,281
Do you expect 
us to be soft with our enemies?

1040
01:29:27,327 --> 01:29:30,160
As you made it soft 
when I almost became a priest?

1041
01:29:30,207 --> 01:29:32,516
Now look at me.

1042
01:29:32,607 --> 01:29:34,757
I have 
an important part in a strong movement ...

1043
01:29:34,807 --> 01:29:37,640
which will soon liberate the world.

1044
01:29:37,687 --> 01:29:40,997
- There is no limit to my future. 
- Your future?

1045
01:29:41,087 --> 01:29:44,477
I thought there was no place for 
individual ambitions in the People’s Party.

1046
01:29:47,887 --> 01:29:52,119
I warn you that even 
my patience can reach its limits.

1047
01:29:52,207 --> 01:29:54,516
These confessions 
must be signed immediately!

1048
01:29:54,607 --> 01:29:56,962
Young priest, you're smarter.

1049
01:29:57,087 --> 01:29:59,362
Would you explain to this 
confused old man ...

1050
01:29:59,447 --> 01:30:01,915
that signing papers 
means freedom?

1051
01:30:01,967 --> 01:30:04,003
I'm trying to help you.

1052
01:30:04,047 --> 01:30:06,481
So you're trying to help us?

1053
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:08,762
And I'm the confused old man?

1054
01:30:09,607 --> 01:30:13,600
You are a blasphemer and a traitor, 
a disciple of the devil.

1055
01:30:13,687 --> 01:30:14,836
I know what you're up to.

1056
01:30:14,927 --> 01:30:18,078
Who will make my confession ...

1057
01:30:18,167 --> 01:30:20,556
in the village with all those lies ...

1058
01:30:20,647 --> 01:30:24,423
for people to read that 
I spent my whole life scamming.

1059
01:30:24,467 --> 01:30:27,562
I came to China on behalf of the Lord ...

1060
01:30:27,607 --> 01:30:30,167
to take care of the sick 
and the poor.

1061
01:30:30,247 --> 01:30:32,761
I will not deceive them.

1062
01:30:32,847 --> 01:30:36,442
I will never fool them.

1063
01:30:36,527 --> 01:30:39,360
Now I want to go back to my cell to sleep.

1064
01:30:50,687 --> 01:30:55,556
If he dies, he will go to his prison. 
You will kill him.

1065
01:30:56,247 --> 01:30:59,045
He will be a martyr of the people 
who loved and respected them.

1066
01:31:01,367 --> 01:31:05,201
And then what will 
people think of you, Ho-San?

1067
01:31:05,287 --> 01:31:08,836
I will instruct my soldiers 
to leave the mission area.

1068
01:31:08,927 --> 01:31:12,078
So you can go back and 
die in your own bed.

1069
01:31:14,167 --> 01:31:18,665
I think this will be the best 
for your future.

1070
01:31:28,367 --> 01:31:29,959
I'll be done soon.

1071
01:31:39,007 --> 01:31:41,805
Ho-San brought my bed back 
to die in it.

1072
01:31:41,887 --> 01:31:45,562
I'm not worried about you anymore, Father. 
You are indestructible.

1073
01:31:45,607 --> 01:31:47,962
Be careful with that razor.

1074
01:31:48,047 --> 01:31:51,119
I have to 
keep my little blood left over.

1075
01:31:55,287 --> 01:31:57,847
I can do this on my own.

1076
01:32:04,167 --> 01:32:08,718
I have to say my help was 
in his two-handed way.

1077
01:32:08,807 --> 01:32:11,446
I 
’m even starting to feel some appreciation for you.

1078
01:32:13,607 --> 01:32:16,041
That's the sweetest thing 
you've ever told me, Father.

1079
01:32:16,127 --> 01:32:18,436
I know, I've already regretted it.

1080
01:32:20,927 --> 01:32:22,838
Thanks.

1081
01:32:24,767 --> 01:32:28,043
Well, I'll put myself here.

1082
01:32:30,207 --> 01:32:33,643
The soldiers, in their haste outward 
, forgot some food here.

1083
01:32:33,727 --> 01:32:36,605
If 
I’m lucky, maybe I can make a Sino-Irish stew.

1084
01:32:36,687 --> 01:32:38,803
I'll take a risk after the prison toast.

1085
01:32:38,887 --> 01:32:42,038
But there should be only one chewy meat per serving.

1086
01:32:42,087 --> 01:32:44,726
While it cooks, I wash a little.

1087
01:32:46,447 --> 01:32:49,086
Sino-Irish stew?

1088
01:32:56,087 --> 01:32:58,647
Father, I hope you feel better.

1089
01:32:58,727 --> 01:33:02,003
- How did my stew taste? 
- I made a mistake.

1090
01:33:02,127 --> 01:33:04,925
I was so hungry 
that I ate two chewy meats.

1091
01:33:05,007 --> 01:33:07,840
Well, I did a lot more, just 
in case you changed your mind.

1092
01:33:08,967 --> 01:33:10,559
I will not.

1093
01:33:23,582 --> 01:33:25,082
Sri Lanka.

1094
01:33:30,407 --> 01:33:32,863
Forgive my father for coming back.

1095
01:33:33,647 --> 01:33:35,539
But I need help.

1096
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:39,706
I'm expecting a baby.

1097
01:33:41,687 --> 01:33:43,279
We.

1098
01:33:47,807 --> 01:33:50,719
Come in. 
I give him permission.

1099
01:33:51,967 --> 01:33:53,002
Come in.

1100
01:34:10,727 --> 01:34:13,036
Come on, baby. 
Sit down.

1101
01:34:21,047 --> 01:34:22,639
Thank you, Father.

1102
01:34:25,167 --> 01:34:29,206
If I were married, I would be 
overwhelmed with happiness now.

1103
01:34:30,447 --> 01:34:31,926
But now I have only sadness.

1104
01:34:32,047 --> 01:34:36,320
When his father realized his condition, 
he instructed him to leave his home.

1105
01:34:38,047 --> 01:34:41,039
To preserve the memory of our ancestors.

1106
01:34:41,127 --> 01:34:43,038
Natural.

1107
01:34:43,087 --> 01:34:44,679
And her mother?

1108
01:34:45,647 --> 01:34:48,605
My father gave money without his knowledge 
and wished him luck.

1109
01:34:50,527 --> 01:34:52,438
Then he came back here.

1110
01:34:55,767 --> 01:34:57,325
Well, father.

1111
01:34:59,367 --> 01:35:01,597
Siu-Lan, why did you come back?

1112
01:35:05,287 --> 01:35:08,199
She's back because she's expecting a child.

1113
01:35:11,942 --> 01:35:13,442
Oh, no.

1114
01:35:17,367 --> 01:35:19,278
This is a terrible situation.

1115
01:35:22,887 --> 01:35:24,878
I'm sorry, Siu-Lan. 
I...

1116
01:35:24,927 --> 01:35:27,919
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
This possibility never occurred to me.

1117
01:35:29,767 --> 01:35:31,819
He should have sent it earlier.

1118
01:35:31,907 --> 01:35:33,465
Again.

1119
01:35:36,047 --> 01:35:37,639
This is a tragedy.

1120
01:35:39,207 --> 01:35:41,801
I agree.

1121
01:35:41,887 --> 01:35:44,879
Stop walking up and down and 
do something. Call for help.

1122
01:35:47,287 --> 01:35:50,006
"I'll bring Ho-San's mother here." 
- Please.

1123
01:35:55,246 --> 01:35:57,237
Why Ho-San's mother?

1124
01:35:57,326 --> 01:35:59,681
Ho-San is the father.

1125
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:07,555
"Didn't Father O'Banion tell you?" 
- No.

1126
01:36:11,806 --> 01:36:15,003
He also knows 
it happened against my will.

1127
01:36:40,166 --> 01:36:43,078
- All is well? 
- Nan hsiao wa wa.

1128
01:36:44,926 --> 01:36:46,837
--Nan hsiao ... micsoda? --Wa 
wa.

1129
01:36:48,846 --> 01:36:49,881
Father Bovard.

1130
01:36:51,486 --> 01:36:54,000
Father Bovard. 
Siu-Lan had just given birth to the baby.

1131
01:36:54,126 --> 01:36:56,481
- Boy or girl? 
- A nan hsiao wa wa.

1132
01:36:57,486 --> 01:36:59,841
She must be strong while she is breastfeeding.

1133
01:36:59,886 --> 01:37:01,763
That's exactly what I was thinking. 
I heat the stew.

1134
01:37:01,806 --> 01:37:03,717
You barely touched it.

1135
01:37:03,846 --> 01:37:07,395
Crush, pull out, and take out 
those horrible chewy meats.

1136
01:37:07,486 --> 01:37:10,523
Maybe it will be nutritious for him.

1137
01:37:10,566 --> 01:37:12,682
- Oh, Father Bovard. 
- Yes?

1138
01:37:12,766 --> 01:37:15,439
Mi az a nan hsiao wa wa?

1139
01:37:16,446 --> 01:37:18,164
A beautiful baby boy.

1140
01:37:36,446 --> 01:37:39,199
I made some food.

1141
01:37:39,246 --> 01:37:41,157
I hope it will taste fine.

1142
01:37:44,966 --> 01:37:46,035
Beautiful.

1143
01:37:48,726 --> 01:37:50,478
Very beautiful.

1144
01:37:52,126 --> 01:37:56,199
But this kind of beauty 
comes from a wonderful love between a man and a woman .

1145
01:37:57,926 --> 01:37:59,882
As it should be.

1146
01:38:04,046 --> 01:38:06,879
I heard I have a son.

1147
01:38:06,926 --> 01:38:09,235
I thought it was best if you knew.

1148
01:38:24,366 --> 01:38:27,642
Strong family similarities, Ho-San.

1149
01:38:27,726 --> 01:38:29,717
Too strong.

1150
01:38:29,806 --> 01:38:32,320
"I'd talk to Siu-Lan face to face." 
- No.

1151
01:38:37,926 --> 01:38:40,121
Don't leave him alone, Father.

1152
01:38:40,166 --> 01:38:42,361
I'll be outside nearby.

1153
01:39:06,206 --> 01:39:07,764
What about Ho-San?

1154
01:39:10,166 --> 01:39:12,202
Oh, Ho-San was a beautiful baby.

1155
01:39:13,926 --> 01:39:15,518
Well, it has changed.

1156
01:39:17,086 --> 01:39:19,441
The baby is crying. 
He must be in pain.

1157
01:39:37,006 --> 01:39:39,201
Maybe the baby wants his dad.

1158
01:40:01,406 --> 01:40:05,445
I will move this mother and child 
to my parents ’house as soon as possible .

1159
01:40:05,486 --> 01:40:07,602
I will not allow my mother 
and father to come on a mission.

1160
01:40:07,686 --> 01:40:09,324
Good. This will make it easier for them.

1161
01:40:11,166 --> 01:40:13,600
And you, 
come to my headquarters tomorrow morning.

1162
01:40:19,766 --> 01:40:21,722
What did you say when you were alone?

1163
01:40:21,806 --> 01:40:26,197
He said something like he regretted 
that this was how things happened,

1164
01:40:26,286 --> 01:40:28,117
because if it hadn't happened ...

1165
01:40:28,206 --> 01:40:30,766
it would have happened differently 
or something like that.

1166
01:40:30,806 --> 01:40:32,842
Compared to Ho-San, that means a lot.

1167
01:40:34,486 --> 01:40:35,521
Not for me.

1168
01:40:36,966 --> 01:40:39,924
I now foresee the future of 
"nan hsiao wa wa".

1169
01:40:40,006 --> 01:40:41,564
Indeed?

1170
01:40:56,726 --> 01:40:58,318
Good morning.

1171
01:40:59,566 --> 01:41:01,955
Young priest. 
I called it because ...

1172
01:41:02,006 --> 01:41:05,476
Before you begin, I 
have a message for you from your son.

1173
01:41:05,566 --> 01:41:08,319
He said, "Gu."

1174
01:41:09,966 --> 01:41:12,560
Don't talk like an idiot.

1175
01:41:12,646 --> 01:41:15,444
I received important news.

1176
01:41:15,486 --> 01:41:17,681
Many other priests and converts ...

1177
01:41:17,726 --> 01:41:21,036
they signed their confession 
and left China.

1178
01:41:21,086 --> 01:41:23,636
At least they had the wits 
to admit defeat.

1179
01:41:47,606 --> 01:41:49,881
Please explain to my comrade ...

1180
01:41:49,966 --> 01:41:53,003
since he doesn't speak russian 
and i don't speak chinese ...

1181
01:41:53,046 --> 01:41:55,435
I also speak English.

1182
01:41:55,486 --> 01:41:57,158
Good. Good.

1183
01:41:57,206 --> 01:42:01,836
So we have a common language, 
even if it is despicable.

1184
01:42:01,926 --> 01:42:03,837
Please understand, Comrade, 
that the Russians ...

1185
01:42:03,926 --> 01:42:06,679
they do not give the appearance that 
they have power over themselves.

1186
01:42:06,726 --> 01:42:10,924
I am only here to suggest those who will exercise this power.

1187
01:42:11,006 --> 01:42:13,520
Forgive me.

1188
01:42:13,566 --> 01:42:15,955
I am aware of your rank, Comrade.

1189
01:42:16,006 --> 01:42:17,962
Why is the priest here?

1190
01:42:18,046 --> 01:42:20,480
He only taught about communism.

1191
01:42:20,566 --> 01:42:24,844
What a pity he doesn't have a better teacher.

1192
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:28,604
Well, if you'll excuse me.

1193
01:42:28,686 --> 01:42:30,438
Wait.

1194
01:42:31,206 --> 01:42:33,162
You mean, like, this alien spy ...

1195
01:42:33,206 --> 01:42:35,674
does he actually come 
and go as he pleases?

1196
01:42:35,766 --> 01:42:37,597
Only between this house and the mission.

1197
01:42:37,686 --> 01:42:40,402
There is an old priest who became very ill 
when he was in prison.

1198
01:42:41,526 --> 01:42:42,754
- And I thought ... 
- I know.

1199
01:42:42,846 --> 01:42:47,124
His file shows that 
he spends a lot of time thinking individually.

1200
01:42:47,206 --> 01:42:49,595
And little else.

1201
01:42:49,686 --> 01:42:52,883
Please, sit down. 
We'll talk to you later.

1202
01:42:57,486 --> 01:43:00,603
Comrade, this is your file.

1203
01:43:13,726 --> 01:43:18,083
Absolutely the worst thing I 
’ve ever had the misfortune to study.

1204
01:43:18,206 --> 01:43:20,162
The village's folk education plan ...

1205
01:43:20,246 --> 01:43:22,965
his results are worse than deplorable.

1206
01:43:23,006 --> 01:43:26,521
Because the old priest had a 
great influence on the people.

1207
01:43:26,606 --> 01:43:28,437
But the old priest wanted to leave China.

1208
01:43:28,526 --> 01:43:30,437
- Why did you stop it? 
- I thought...

1209
01:43:30,526 --> 01:43:33,165
Here, he's thinking again.

1210
01:43:33,206 --> 01:43:36,562
It seemed best to put 
it on a pedestal in front of people.

1211
01:43:36,646 --> 01:43:40,002
So he's been here a year. 
Why didn't you put it on your cloak?

1212
01:43:40,086 --> 01:43:42,805
It is a very difficult case. 
He doesn't know him.

1213
01:43:42,829 --> 01:43:44,829
No.

1214
01:43:46,486 --> 01:43:48,556
But I'm getting to know you.

1215
01:43:48,606 --> 01:43:52,724
Colonel himself is soft. 
Take this house, for example.

1216
01:43:52,846 --> 01:43:54,723
Why live in this luxury ...

1217
01:43:54,806 --> 01:43:57,798
when 
should you be with your soldiers in the village?

1218
01:43:57,886 --> 01:44:01,356
- I have a military barracks there. 
- Yes, what's covered in dust.

1219
01:44:01,446 --> 01:44:03,801
And these are upscale furniture.

1220
01:44:03,886 --> 01:44:06,002
Why don't you distribute it to people ...

1221
01:44:06,086 --> 01:44:08,316
according to the rules of procedure of the People's Party?

1222
01:44:08,366 --> 01:44:10,596
I distributed the food I found here.

1223
01:44:10,686 --> 01:44:14,076
But what would peasants 
do with this upscale furniture?

1224
01:44:14,166 --> 01:44:16,282
Would they use firewood 
to cook their rice?

1225
01:44:16,326 --> 01:44:21,195
So you are 
talking contempt about the peasants.

1226
01:44:21,246 --> 01:44:24,556
I just meant they did 
n’t need classy things.

1227
01:44:24,606 --> 01:44:28,485
That's why 
you take all the classy things yourself, huh?

1228
01:44:28,566 --> 01:44:32,923
This is a sad situation.

1229
01:44:34,046 --> 01:44:35,877
Very sad...

1230
01:44:35,966 --> 01:44:40,721
to find an officer in office 
who did not teach himself.

1231
01:44:40,806 --> 01:44:43,240
No matter how much you deny it. 
You are still a Christian.

1232
01:44:43,326 --> 01:44:47,956
He left the priests free, even though 
they did not sign their confessions.

1233
01:44:48,006 --> 01:44:51,123
He sent his own soldiers from the barracks ...

1234
01:44:51,166 --> 01:44:53,600
for priests to live in luxury.

1235
01:44:53,686 --> 01:44:56,246
If you think you have eight months in captivity ...

1236
01:44:56,326 --> 01:44:57,736
Quiet!

1237
01:44:58,846 --> 01:45:00,723
He refused to share with the people ...

1238
01:45:00,806 --> 01:45:04,496
to afford 
to live in luxury as a capitalist.

1239
01:45:06,086 --> 01:45:08,805
You bring shame to 
the Communist Army.

1240
01:45:08,846 --> 01:45:11,041
You betrayed the People's Party.

1241
01:45:11,086 --> 01:45:14,476
- I did what I thought was best. 
- He's thinking again.

1242
01:45:14,526 --> 01:45:16,517
He always thinks.

1243
01:45:18,046 --> 01:45:20,082
If they send me where I will suggest ...

1244
01:45:20,166 --> 01:45:22,999
you will have a lot of time to think.

1245
01:45:23,086 --> 01:45:26,522
I will also suggest that 
Comrade Chung Ren replace himself in his position.

1246
01:45:26,646 --> 01:45:28,682
Thank you, comrade.

1247
01:45:28,766 --> 01:45:31,121
Before sending elsewhere ...

1248
01:45:31,206 --> 01:45:34,835
i'll show you how you should 
have done your thing.

1249
01:45:34,886 --> 01:45:37,036
I would love to learn.

1250
01:45:39,366 --> 01:45:43,279
I’ll start by showing you how to get 
the old priest to testify quickly.

1251
01:45:43,326 --> 01:45:45,237
No.

1252
01:45:45,286 --> 01:45:48,039
By any further torture of Father Bovard ...

1253
01:45:48,126 --> 01:45:50,686
they only 
violate their own interests before the people.

1254
01:45:50,766 --> 01:45:53,155
Ho-San is right.

1255
01:45:53,206 --> 01:45:56,482
We found another match ...

1256
01:45:56,566 --> 01:46:00,798
about how 
he and the church govern the People’s Party.

1257
01:46:00,846 --> 01:46:05,203
However, with your permission, 
we will act in accordance with the agreed procedure.

1258
01:46:05,286 --> 01:46:10,519
Within 24 hours, Chung Ren 
obtains the testimony of both priests.

1259
01:46:10,566 --> 01:46:14,525
And within 25 hours, you will be sent ...

1260
01:46:19,566 --> 01:46:22,717
Do you know, Colonel? 
The further I look at you ...

1261
01:46:22,806 --> 01:46:26,082
the farther you will be sent.

1262
01:46:26,166 --> 01:46:29,636
Get ready for a long trip tomorrow.

1263
01:46:36,806 --> 01:46:39,366
So the suffering started ...

1264
01:46:39,406 --> 01:46:41,283
to us and to you.

1265
01:46:41,326 --> 01:46:46,241
Me? 
They're just going to be sent.

1266
01:46:46,326 --> 01:46:51,605
Alone. 
I wonder what will happen to your son.

1267
01:46:51,686 --> 01:46:54,405
Fortunately, he is too young 
to remember himself.

1268
01:46:54,486 --> 01:46:57,778
- But since family ties 
mean nothing ... - Stop it!

1269
01:47:01,166 --> 01:47:03,077
You're right.

1270
01:47:03,206 --> 01:47:04,764
I'm sorry.

1271
01:47:34,446 --> 01:47:36,801
What worries you, comrade?

1272
01:47:36,846 --> 01:47:39,121
Don't have a stomach for that?

1273
01:47:39,206 --> 01:47:41,959
I didn’t know I should enjoy it.

1274
01:47:43,606 --> 01:47:44,641
Anyway?

1275
01:47:44,726 --> 01:47:48,082
Are they ready to testify and 
tell the people the truth?

1276
01:47:49,726 --> 01:47:51,876
- Are you ready, Father? 
- Yes.

1277
01:47:53,366 --> 01:47:56,722
He is ready to tell the truth.

1278
01:48:01,326 --> 01:48:04,955
The old man is weakening. 
Ready to testify.

1279
01:48:34,566 --> 01:48:39,117
"This is the man you called 'my father,' 
this is the man you trusted ..."

1280
01:48:39,206 --> 01:48:41,083
this is the man you confessed to ...

1281
01:48:43,486 --> 01:48:47,115
you will hear from your own mouth 
how he has betrayed you.

1282
01:48:55,286 --> 01:48:57,880
Turn it over. 
What do you say?

1283
01:48:57,966 --> 01:49:02,596
He was asked to testify 
on behalf of himself and the young priest.

1284
01:49:02,646 --> 01:49:07,083
But those who asked him to testify 
made it difficult for him to speak ...

1285
01:49:07,166 --> 01:49:09,839
due to strangulation.

1286
01:49:09,926 --> 01:49:13,555
Your dog opens his mouth too wide.

1287
01:49:13,646 --> 01:49:15,284
And at the cost of difficulties.

1288
01:49:17,926 --> 01:49:21,680
"Here is my answer to those who tortured me.

1289
01:49:26,126 --> 01:49:27,957
Their leaders are ...

1290
01:49:28,046 --> 01:49:31,197
who destroyed 
their religious freedom ...

1291
01:49:31,246 --> 01:49:33,157
and they humbled themselves 
into slavery. "

1292
01:49:41,126 --> 01:49:45,358
"But they cannot destroy 
their faith in God ...

1293
01:49:45,406 --> 01:49:48,921
if they have the willpower 
to let fire burn in their hearts. "

1294
01:50:05,646 --> 01:50:07,955
I never wanted violence.

1295
01:50:09,926 --> 01:50:12,121
Let's pray ...

1296
01:50:12,166 --> 01:50:15,636
that no one may lose his life because of me.

1297
01:50:43,846 --> 01:50:46,314
I called the barracks to 
report this situation.

1298
01:50:46,366 --> 01:50:49,403
- They're sending reinforcements. 
- No reinforcement required.

1299
01:50:49,486 --> 01:50:52,081
30 armed soldiers 
can control the crowd.

1300
01:51:52,126 --> 01:51:55,084
So can you control this ...?

1301
01:51:55,126 --> 01:51:58,038
So can you control 
this situation with 30 soldiers?

1302
01:51:58,126 --> 01:52:01,277
Some inferior villains from the mountains 
joined the crowd.

1303
01:52:01,326 --> 01:52:05,114
- Priests will be punished for this. "So 
what's your next brilliant idea, Comrade?"

1304
01:52:05,166 --> 01:52:08,397
Public hearing for priests, 
followed by execution.

1305
01:52:11,446 --> 01:52:13,880
Wait.

1306
01:52:13,966 --> 01:52:17,561
Before they take me, 
could I have another thought?

1307
01:52:17,606 --> 01:52:18,675
Me?

1308
01:52:18,766 --> 01:52:21,519
I would suggest that 
you deport the priests now ...

1309
01:52:21,606 --> 01:52:25,155
there would be no living role models 
or dead martyrs.

1310
01:52:25,206 --> 01:52:27,481
The uprising would have no cause.

1311
01:52:37,686 --> 01:52:42,555
Do you know? 
This time the soft is right.

1312
01:52:42,646 --> 01:52:45,922
Get rid of the causers.

1313
01:52:51,006 --> 01:52:54,043
Shameful expulsion from China.

1314
01:52:54,126 --> 01:52:56,082
Not ashamed, Father.

1315
01:52:56,166 --> 01:52:59,556
People will always remember 
that you told the truth yourself.

1316
01:52:59,646 --> 01:53:01,238
I hope so.

1317
01:53:11,606 --> 01:53:13,164
Ez Ho-San.

1318
01:53:20,126 --> 01:53:22,515
Now send us back to the village to 
be shot.

1319
01:53:22,606 --> 01:53:25,074
This is not an instruction. 
I'm trying to escape.

1320
01:53:25,166 --> 01:53:27,206
- I need their help. 
- How can we help?

1321
01:53:27,206 --> 01:53:29,276
I planned everything. 
Get in my car.

1322
01:53:29,326 --> 01:53:31,601
If we're lucky, we'll do it before ...

1323
01:53:37,446 --> 01:53:40,006
I just wanted to ask if you understand English.

1324
01:53:40,086 --> 01:53:43,362
No more questions now. 
Hurry up. I'll tell you everything later.

1325
01:54:02,366 --> 01:54:05,399
This was my last 
act that did not fit the Christian.

1326
01:54:11,166 --> 01:54:13,555
You can sit up now. 
Don't drown.

1327
01:54:14,661 --> 01:54:15,861
Sri Lanka.

1328
01:54:15,886 --> 01:54:19,720
I'm grateful they joined. 
I hope we have a safe journey.

1329
01:54:20,646 --> 01:54:22,238
Is he here by free will?

1330
01:54:22,326 --> 01:54:25,682
I'm just with Ho-San for the baby.

1331
01:54:25,766 --> 01:54:27,996
If we get to Hong Kong freely ...

1332
01:54:28,086 --> 01:54:29,804
we are getting married ...

1333
01:54:29,886 --> 01:54:32,081
just because of the baby.

1334
01:54:32,166 --> 01:54:34,202
Just to give the baby a name.

1335
01:54:35,061 --> 01:54:37,061
No...

1336
01:54:37,086 --> 01:54:40,317
There is more to it. 
I want to raise my son ...

1337
01:54:40,366 --> 01:54:42,197
"A fiamat"?

1338
01:54:42,246 --> 01:54:44,202
Our son ...

1339
01:54:44,286 --> 01:54:47,642
where parents are free to 
talk to their child.

1340
01:54:47,726 --> 01:54:51,685
You have to learn a lot from your father’s mistakes.

1341
01:54:56,246 --> 01:54:59,363
He was a strong opponent, Ho-San.

1342
01:54:59,406 --> 01:55:03,035
I hope 
he will be just as strong as an ally.

1343
01:55:03,086 --> 01:55:05,805
I'm trying to be like that.

1344
01:55:05,886 --> 01:55:10,562
One day, I 
suffered a lifelong disappointment.

1345
01:55:10,646 --> 01:55:14,719
I saw my mother 
and father shot in a chapel ...

1346
01:55:14,806 --> 01:55:16,717
just because they went to pray.

1347
01:55:18,701 --> 01:55:20,701
Oh, no.

1348
01:55:20,726 --> 01:55:23,286
After all my years in China ...

1349
01:55:23,366 --> 01:55:26,517
a sense of uselessness caught on.

1350
01:55:26,606 --> 01:55:29,678
Not my father. This is the greatest recognition 
the Communists have been able to give themselves.

1351
01:55:29,766 --> 01:55:32,644
They were so afraid of his strength 
that they had to reject themselves.

1352
01:55:33,966 --> 01:55:35,797
That's exactly what I told you.

1353
01:55:48,406 --> 01:55:50,840
They follow us.

1354
01:55:50,966 --> 01:55:52,922
This is the killer of Chung Ren, my mother and father.

1355
01:55:54,926 --> 01:55:58,316
Forgive me for a moment. 
I'll be right back.

1356
01:56:11,166 --> 01:56:15,956
I have now performed my first act 
as a returned Christian.

1357
01:56:27,686 --> 01:56:29,881
See how well I designed it?

1358
01:56:29,966 --> 01:56:32,355
The guards on the communist side of the bridge 
will think ...

1359
01:56:32,406 --> 01:56:34,283
that we are a poor peasant family.

1360
01:56:34,326 --> 01:56:37,443
And they are strangers 
who have expulsion papers.

1361
01:56:37,526 --> 01:56:40,518
But on the free side, 
we will suddenly not be strangers to each other.

1362
01:56:40,606 --> 01:56:43,120
I replaced the baby's pelus. 
We are ready to go.

1363
01:56:43,206 --> 01:56:46,755
My wife will be their cook 
and I will be their humble maid.

1364
01:56:46,846 --> 01:56:49,314
And will we guarantee your own plan?

1365
01:56:49,406 --> 01:56:51,283
This is my plan. 
I figured everything out.

1366
01:56:51,406 --> 01:56:54,080
You better think again about 
how to become a humble homemaker.

1367
01:56:54,086 --> 01:56:56,475
Forgive my apparent arrogance ...

1368
01:56:56,566 --> 01:56:59,319
but I brought ourselves 
a few miles from freedom.

1369
01:56:59,406 --> 01:57:03,194
He 
thought of this brain they wanted to turn off .

1370
01:57:05,166 --> 01:57:06,315
For everything except that.

1371
01:57:08,646 --> 01:57:11,399
They showed again how stupid they were.

1372
01:57:11,486 --> 01:57:14,956
- It's impossible to land in this place. 
- It doesn't sound like a plane.

1373
01:57:17,806 --> 01:57:19,956
Helicopter.

1374
01:57:20,046 --> 01:57:23,038
Let's hide quickly among the trees.

1375
01:57:28,326 --> 01:57:30,203
They think I'm traveling alone. 
Without me...

1376
01:57:30,286 --> 01:57:32,754
they can safely cross the border.

1377
01:57:32,846 --> 01:57:37,840
Siu-Lan, one day you might be 
telling our son good things about me.

1378
01:57:37,926 --> 01:57:39,757
He will be very proud of you.

1379
01:57:47,966 --> 01:57:49,001
Father Bovard, wait!

1380
01:58:59,086 --> 01:59:02,442
They are the godparents. 
My uncle Ho Yung Fung ...

1381
01:59:02,526 --> 01:59:04,915
and my aunt Ho Tai Tai.

1382
01:59:07,526 --> 01:59:09,721
Well, it would be time 
to baptize the baby.

1383
01:59:10,726 --> 01:59:12,539
What name will the child be given?

1384
01:59:14,926 --> 01:59:17,235
It was your idea. 
You tell me.

1385
01:59:18,126 --> 01:59:20,686
Ho-ban-yon.

1386
01:59:20,766 --> 01:59:22,324
Ho what?

1387
01:59:24,606 --> 01:59:26,517
Ho-ban-yon.

1388
01:59:28,686 --> 01:59:32,838
His wish is to keep 
his name in my family.
