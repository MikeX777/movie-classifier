1
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,020
The 2020 Tokyo Olympics!

2
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,770
Our panelists will discuss

3
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,610
the Olympics we're hosting in 5 years.

4
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,770
The 1964 Tokyo Olympics symbolises
our economic miracle.

5
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,910
What will the 2020 Tokyo Olympics
be for us?

6
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,330
Some worry about the negative impact
of urban renewal.

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,370
Well, internationally...

8
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,960
the nuclear crisis isn't over...

9
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,220
From the point of view of
brain science

10
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,880
trying new things
increases dopamine levels.

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,470
That's a no-brainer!

12
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,730
No, really!

13
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:16,820
Sports isn't the great unifier
it once was.

14
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,400
The Olympics isn't for kids.

15
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,370
It's the children who enjoy the games

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,740
not adults.

17
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,290
They're hopeless!

18
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,080
They lie around doing nothing!

19
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,750
They won't even watch this show.

20
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,670
They're so lazy!

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,510
The 2020 Olympics will make Japan
great again.

22
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,560
It will bring prosperity
to all of us.

23
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,060
Everyone... except one person.

24
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,070
Only he will miss out.

25
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,440
I mean that pathetic
Ryoichi Suzuki.

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,520
He's so behind.

27
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,030
This man is hopeless.

28
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,250
A national disgrace.

29
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,110
Ryoichi Suzuki is out of date.

30
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,290
No one would want him.

31
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,800
That's the opinion of the
brain science community too.

32
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,050
His name repulses me.

33
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,250
Why does he exist?

34
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,510
33-year-old Suzuki
is an ex-rock singer.

35
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,920
He had a band when he was 21.

36
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,560
He quit because no one came
to his 3 concerts.

37
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,390
And he became a clerk.

38
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,810
Mr. Tahara, say something to him.

39
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,230
Suzuki, you're history.

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,000
Ouch!

41
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,770
Open up!

42
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,240
- You loser, Suzuki.
- You're hopeless!

43
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,770
You're finished!

44
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,160
Wait!

45
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,910
Watch it!

46
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,870
Sorry.

47
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,120
Ouch!

48
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,760
Hi, loser!
Not well?

49
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,760
Good morning.

50
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,630
Excuse me.

51
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,510
Good morning.

52
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,560
Loser! You coming or what?
.

53
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,560
What music's that?

54
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,510
See here?

55
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,510
Do it, please.

56
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,840
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,520
Sorry!

58
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,220
I haven't spoken yet.

59
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,690
Piece. A piece of music.

60
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,700
There'd be no music without
our components.

61
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,980
They're valuable.

62
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,950
Unlike you!

63
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,870
Go.

64
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,670
Work!

65
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,060
Don't let him get to you.

66
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,020
Ouch...

67
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,780
Hazardous Waste

68
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,280
Um...

69
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,000
If you have a stomach ache...

70
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,490
Take these.

71
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,680
Bargain Sale

72
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,200
Turtles for Sale

73
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,290
This one.

74
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,510
I want it!

75
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,760
70 years ago atomic bombs
were dropped in Japan.

76
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,430
We asked people

77
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,180
which country dropped
the atomic bombs.

78
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,230
Little Turtle.
This is who I really am.

79
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,190
I'm a clerk by day but
this is the real me.

80
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:00,500
Which country dropped A-bombs
in Hiroshima and Nagasaki?

81
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,500
Dunno. Not the USA, they're
our friends.

82
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,920
See the penguins on the iceberg?

83
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:13,210
There are various shapes
of icebergs.

84
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,670
They don't taste salty.

85
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,180
I'm an iceberg.

86
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,510
Are you listening?

87
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,350
You only see an iceberg's tip.

88
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,600
You listening?

89
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,020
I'm actually big.

90
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,070
Most of me is underwater, Turtle!

91
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,490
Turtle...

92
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,360
You deserve a better name...

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,580
Get Rich Quickly

94
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,420
A little turtle with no name
What's a good name?
.

95
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:54,510
We asked 100 young people what
"pikadon" means?

96
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,760
What does "pikadon" mean?
Can you tell me?

97
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,230
I don't know.

98
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,340
How about you?

99
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,340
You don't?

100
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,060
A kaiju?

101
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,020
A kaiju!

102
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,690
Pikadon... Just like a kaiju!

103
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,150
Pikadon!

104
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,440
Pikadon.

105
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,820
Pikadon.

106
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,660
Atomic bombs were
nicknamed "Pikadon."

107
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,370
"Pika" is a flash and
"don" is kaboom!

108
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,960
I'm like the tip of an iceberg.

109
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,170
The biggest part of me is
underwater

110
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:41,350
Ryoichi Suzuki will be big and
leave this place.

111
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,130
Help me become big.

112
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,140
Help me become a huge iceberg.

113
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,020

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,350
No, idiot, don't go that way!

125
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,640
No!

126
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,980
This is my treasure!
It's from Yuko Terashima.

127
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,650
I love Yuko Terashima!

128
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,740
I want to date her.

129
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,170
God, please!

130
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,450
Did you hear that?

131
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,710
Yes, Ryoichi loves Yuko

132
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,700
What a joke!

133
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,710
The 2020 Olympic preparations
are underway

134
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,590
with the completion of
Nippon Stadium.

135
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,810
The 80,000 capacity stadium
won't only be for sport

136
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,190
it'll be a concert venue too.

137
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,810
Start!

138
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,700

You listening, Pikadon?

153
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,630
Pikadon, we'll go to Nippon Stadium!

154
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,090
It opened!
And this one?

155
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,550
It opened! Pikadon!

156
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,890
Good morning

157
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,780
Nippon Stadium. Nippon Stadium...

158
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,000
Work hard,
Loser.

00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,590
- Off we go.
- See you.

160
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:11,640
Nippon Stadium. Nippon Stadium...

161
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,020
To the goal, Pikadon.

162
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,600
Zap! Zap!

163
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:25,150
Kaboom! Die, kaboom!

164
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,150
Wiped out!

165
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,290
Go, Kaiju Pikadon!

166
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,830

167
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,340
Off to Nippon Stadium you go!

168
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,630
Kaiju Pikadon,
my hopes and dreams are with you!

169
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,770
Go to Nippon Stadium!

170
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,760
Congratulations!

171
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:08,650
LOVE & PEACE

172
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,980
Look, Pika. It's raining.

173
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,700
Look.

174
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,500
Yuko.

175
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,950
I'll be big one day.

176
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,670
When that happens
will you be my girl?

177
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,880
Dinner's ready, Pikadon.

178
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,850
You two are close.

179
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,480
Say "Hi!"

180
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,350
Hello!

181
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,650
You know my dreams.

182
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,740
Help them come true.

183
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,250
You're my only friend.
Hi, buddy

184
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,670
What is it?
Are you happy?

185
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,500
Ask Suzuki about these.

186
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:19,100
Can you tell me what these
receipts are for?

187
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,320
Look, it's a turtle!

188
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,150
Oh, my God! He has a turtle!

189
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,690
Show me!

190
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,370
It's his girlfriend.

191
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,950
What's going on?

192
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,240
Suzuki, come here.

193
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,460
Yes.

194
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,950
With the thing!

195
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,090
- Sorry!
- I didn't speak yet!

196
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,550
That your missing piece?

197
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,800
Is it?

198
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,520
Loser!

199
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,320
Don't worry.

200
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,860
Pathetic!

201
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,060
Turtles are bad news.

202
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,850
- Very bad.
- No turtles.

203
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,520
Sorry, Pika...

204
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,730
Get rid of it! Get rid of it!

205
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,870
No! I didn't mean it!

206
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,470
Oh, Pikadon!

207
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,770
Get away, freak!

208
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,480
Forgive me!

209
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,020
Get off me!

210
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,650
- Pikadon, sorry!
- Stay away!

211
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,700
Pika...

212
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,580
Pikadon!

213
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,700
- A new one.
- Who?

214
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:29,200
A new friend!

215
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,740
Come on!

216
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,620
A new friend.

217
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,540
Who is it now?

218
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,510
I want to see!

219
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,720
Hi, little guy.
You found us.

220
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,380
Welcome to Lost & Found Heaven

221
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,100
- It's a turtle
- Yes.

222
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,100
He's so cute!

223
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,020
There's one more.

224
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,110
It's no good.

225
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,280
It's in pieces.

226
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,150
Sulkie, get the tools.

227
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,750
Okay.

228
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,500
Pa, can you fix it?

229
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,660
Where are the tools?

230
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,920
Let's see... Is this it?

231
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,430
My name is Maria. What's yours?

232
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,350
- He can't talk!
- Not yet.

233
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,810
Not without Pa's candy.

234
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:40,930
Besides, down here
you can forget your old name.

235
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,900
After our former owners threw us out.

236
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,610
- But Sulkie...
- Am I right?

237
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,200
Stop feeling sorry for yourselves.

238
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,700
I love the name my owner gave me.

239
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,120
It was my owner's parents

240
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,460
who threw me out in her absence.

241
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,210
My owner still...

242
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,550
Yes, you told us that before

243
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,130
Don't sulk.

244
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,780
Don't waste your time.
It's so battered.

245
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,110
- He can do it.
- Pa, give it up.

246
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,600
Can you fix it?

247
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,110
He can't.

248
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,780
Oh, no.

249
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,570
What a shame!

250
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,990
It's so sad.

251
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,740
Pa, I knew you could!

252
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,160
You did it!

253
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:51,170
I don't know how you ended up here
but...

254
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:58,140
you're here now.
You can relax and recuperate.

255
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,600
Right?

256
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:08,110
Everybody here has a similar
story to you.

257
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,150
- We're friends.
- You're one of us.

258
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:17,910
Everyone, be nice to your
new friend!

259
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:20,080
Yay!

260
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,750
I'm off to bed.

261
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,920
OK?

262
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,920
It's still early.

263
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,720
Pa.

264
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,800
- Give him a candy.
- Why?

265
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,680
So we can talk.

266
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,260
Good idea.

267
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,600
You want to talk. Okay.

268
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,440
One candy, coming up.

269
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,360
Oh, boy.

270
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,690
I want to know his name.

271
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,540
It's ready.

272
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,590
Ouch, it's hot!

273
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,700
Oh, Pa!

274
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,860
Oh, boy.

275
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,250
Now you've done it!

276
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,080
Where's the Speech candy?

277
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,960
- Can I have one?
.
- Help me, guys.

278
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,460
Help me clean up.

279
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,870
Looks yummy.

280
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,580
Celebration!

281
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:57,760
Turtle! Turtle!...

282
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,900
What's your name, Turtle?

283
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,310
It's time for the ceremony.

284
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,160
Have a candy, Turtle.

285
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,410
Here.

286
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,750
How's that? Can you talk?

287
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,050
I'm Maria What is your name?

288
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,730
Hey?

289
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,060
- Turtles are quiet.
- He won't talk.

290
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,300
Pa, don't fall asleep.

291
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,520
Okay.

292
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,020
Say something

293
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,230
Turtle?

294
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,810
He won't talk.

295
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,690
It's the humans' fault.

296
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:03,450
They throw away their things
when they're bored.

297
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,030
He's too hurt to speak.

298
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,700
Be quiet!

299
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,250
Don't sulk.

300
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:12,750
What was your owner like?

301
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,550
I used to live with
a lovely family.

302
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,640
They loved me so much.

303
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,550
Then why are you here?

304
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,510
My owner's name is Yuri.

305
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,270
She's a very pretty girl.

306
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,480
She held me when she slept.

307
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,450
Guys, don't start

308
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,210
Don't leave me...

309
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,840
Why did you throw me away?

310
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,210
I want to go home.

311
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,680
Don't leave me

312
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,680
I want to go home.

313
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,530
Please keep me...

314
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,420
I want to go home.

315
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,520
I won't ever forget you...

316
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,650
I won't...

317
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,030
I'll never forget!

318
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:19,760
Pikadon, I won't ever forget you!

319
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,680
Pikadon

320
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,820
I won't ever forget you

321
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,360
With the Tokyo Olympics ahead

322
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:52,620
The whole nation will
get richer and prosper

323
00:27:53,540 --> 00:28:01,960
I'll try to throw away the
bitter past

324
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,840
With my eyes closed

325
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,090
Ears covered

326
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,300
And my mouth shut

327
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:19,940
But no matter how hard
I pretend to be happy...

328
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,240
Turtle?

329
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,630
Oops...!

330
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,290
- Turtle!
- What's wrong?

331
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,510
What's going on, Pa?

332
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,300
- It's a mistake!
- What?

333
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,340
What did you do?

334
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,310
Listen, Turtle.
Remember the candy I gave you?

335
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,810
That wasn't Speech candy.

336
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,440
I gave you the Wish candy instead.

337
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,950
You had such a candy?

338
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,700
You never mentioned it!

339
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,610
We want it too, don't we?

340
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,280
Yes!

341
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,790
It's unfair. I can talk
but that's all.

342
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,880
Look at my old dress!

343
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,090
I have a wish list too.
Give me a candy, please.

344
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,010
Why didn't you tell us?

345
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,890
- You want Wish candy?
- Yes, we do!

346
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,860
You could have one
if you want it so badly but...

347
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,110
Listen. Your wishes will get
bigger every time

348
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,570
and you'll grow big
like Turtle here.

349
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,830
I can live with that!

350
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,070
Guys, get a grip!

351
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:04,090
I guess you can have
one little wish but...

352
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,500
Is one wish enough?

353
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,760
I just want to go home.

354
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,890
- Yes.
- Me too!

355
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,510
Amen!

356
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,510
Listen, Maria.

357
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,900
What if you went home
and your owner asked you

358
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:28,270
"Maria, can you make my
wishes come true, too?"

359
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,030
Then what?

360
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,190
I wouldn't mind.

361
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:39,910
But you don't know
how greedy people can be.

362
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,870
It'll be one wish after another.

363
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,930
Finally it'll be
monster-sized wishes!

364
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:50,880
No!

365
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,170
Then what would you do?

366
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,310
But I...

367
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:59,180
Now listen carefully.

368
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,940
I know what you'd wish for.

369
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,020
I'll make your wishes
come true before the year ends.

370
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:14,650
That's how I help guys like you
find happy lives.

371
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,160
Your turn will come soon.

372
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,660
It's almost the end of the year!

373
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,370
Not me.

374
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,580
Sulkie?
.

375
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,380
I'll stay. I don't want to go
back to my old life

376
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,180
and be thrown out again.

377
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,930
I'll stay here with you, Pa.

378
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,390
Sulkie, listen to me.

379
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,390
Turtle is in a dangerous
condition now.

380
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,530
He's in pain
and he's getting too big.

381
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,910
His owner must have asked him for
a big wish.

382
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:59,820
I can't imagine.

383
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,500
Pa, how much bigger do you think
he'll get?

384
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,450
He could get much, much bigger...

385
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:16,670
All Turtle's thinking about
is the owner who threw him away.

386
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,510
He loves him so much.

387
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:26,810
Whoever threw the turtle away is
in for many good things.

388
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,770
Many good things...

389
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,200
Pikadon

390
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,210
It's that guy!

391
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,590
Hello again!

392
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,680
Come with us.

393
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,340
Sorry! Sorry!

394
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:07,930
He appeared out of nowhere and...

395
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,240
He freaked me out.

396
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,900
Pikadon!

397
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,570
Get off!

398
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:37,930
Let me go, please!

399
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,970
The wait is over!

400
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,780
I brought along
an insane guest for you!

401
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,570
Give him a big hand!

402
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,410
This man...

403
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,290
He goes crazy
when he sees this!

404
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,250
Listen up.

405
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:20,340
This is the universe as imagined
by ancient people.

406
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,340
It's hilarious!

407
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,010
The world rests on top
of a turtle.

408
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,560
The world is supported
by a turtle!

409
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,390
See? He's insane.

410
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,450
Here!

411
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,660
You can use my guitar.
Why don't you sing?

412
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,210
Go ahead and sing.

413
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,540
Sing!

414
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,840
Use the mic.

415
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,220
Is this OK?

416
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,730
"With the Tokyo Olympics ahead

417
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:02,820
The whole nation will
get richer and prosper

418
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:09,660
I'll try to throw away the
bitter past

419
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:19,580
With my eyes closed, ears covered
and my mouth shut

420
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:28,050
But no matter how hard
I pretend to be happy...

421
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:39,470
Pikadon, I won't ever forget you!

422
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:46,070
Pikadon, I won't ever forget you!

423
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,240
you're burned into my brain

424
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,870
your ace when you were washed away

425
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,870
f

426
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:58,870
How can I go on
pretending that I'm over you!

427
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,800
Pikadon, I won't ever forget you!

428
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:12,390
Pikadon, I won't ever forget you!

429
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,680
You've got to get him.

430
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,970
I'd do anything to get you back now!

431
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:28,480
Because it's impossible
to put you behind me

432
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:36,780
Because it's impossible
to put you behind me".

433
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,630
Wait!

434
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,510
Not so fast.
Who manages you?

435
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,310
You're great!

436
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,900
The turtle!

437
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,180
Get him!

438
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,100
Pikadon, come back to me!

439
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,440
Get him!

440
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,770
Pikadon!

441
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,940
Why did he get so big?

442
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,030
- It he OK?
- Is he in pain?

443
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,200
I can't figure him out.

444
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,040
He's very happy.

445
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,500
What?
.

446
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,420
Turtle, give me this
when it's done.

447
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,180
No turtle today?

448
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,200
Come on!

449
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,660
Thank you.

450
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,710
Ryoichi Suzuki.

451
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,010
What did you do yesterday?
.
Go out with your pet?

452
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:16,390
- Sorry.
- Never mind! You're our little pet.

453
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,970
Hey, where is your pet today?

454
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,050
Not here today?

455
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,570
How's your turtle?

456
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,800
Forgive me!

457
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:02,640
Pika...

458
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,310
Pikadon!

459
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,140
Pikadon, come back!

460
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,850
Pikadon!

461
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,900
Get to work!

462
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,540
You have a visitor.

463
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:26,250
- Coffee for me.
- Get her coffee.

464
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:30,420
Suzuki. She's here to see you.

465
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,930
So you're Ryoichi Suzuki?

466
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,720
May I help you?

467
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,480
I saw your performance yesterday.

468
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:50,480
You were amazing!

469
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,810
- Follow me.
- But...

470
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,030
Please sign with our label
right away.

471
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:08,950
No song has ever got me
so excited!

472
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,040
I promise that I'll make
you a star!

473
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,390
You were born to be a star!

474
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,890
It's about not forgetting
the A-bomb.

475
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,550
Uh, right.

476
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:25,880
It's a unique anti-war song.

477
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:33,770
Everyone's forgotten
those miserable times.

478
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,280
Including the A-bombs.

479
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:43,110
A message about A-bombs in this
apathetic country

480
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,660
is so powerful.

481
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,420
Uh, well...

482
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,960
Remember the A-bombs!
Don't forget the war!

483
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:55,500
This song is so relevant
right now.

484
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,960
Uh... Right.

485
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,880
I'm Inagawa.
I loved your Pikadon.

486
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,680
Welcome aboard.

487
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,760
Welcome.

488
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,510
Welcome.

489
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,230
There's someone I want you to meet.
Hey, Shu!

490
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,560
Sorry about the other day.

491
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:25,030
"Pikadon, I won't ever forget you"

492
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,660
"Love & Peace, I won't
ever forget you"

493
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,660
Love & Peace Love it!

494
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:39,340
You're now with a band
called Revolution Q.

495
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,090
Revolution Q...

496
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,640
The members are, Shu, Dead,
Nega and Jane.

497
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,100
As of today, you're Wild Ryo.

498
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,770
Wild Ryo...?

499
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,560
Sign the contract, Wild Ryo.

500
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,770
Can I call you Ryo?

501
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,770
Quit your job, Ryo.

502
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:01,950
What?

503
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,080
Yeah, you should quit!

504
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:11,080
It doesn't suit your image and
you don't have time for it.

505
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,960
You will be busy.

506
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,590
Listen. You're a hero fighting
the establishment.

507
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,300
A modern-day protest singer.

508
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,390
You're a tough and rebellious agitator!

509
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:33,980
I do think pikadon should go

510
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:35,850
How about Love & Peace?

511
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:40,690
Love & Peace, I won't
ever forget you

512
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,320
That's dope!

513
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,030
Ryo.

514
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,790
Love & Peace, I won't
ever forget you!

515
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,450
I'm on your side.

516
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,290
I have to piss.

517
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,380
It's unreal...

518
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:06,050
Ryo, listen well.

519
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,970
At the end of the year,
quit Revolution Q.

520
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,560
And you'll be left with the fame

521
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,520
And I'll still be your manager.

522
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:25,360
But...

523
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:26,900
It'll make headlines

524
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,960
Maybe...

525
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,660
I'll go home and think it over.

526
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:46,380
Hey, where are you going?

527
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:49,050
To my apartment...

528
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,430
Look in there.

529
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,620
We went ahead and moved in your stuff.

530
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,830
What?

531
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,000
This is your home.

532
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,630
But how...?

533
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,210
I'm kidding! It cost a lot
to replicate.

534
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:27,800
Just like your place.

535
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,420
You can go home.

536
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,300
It's still there.

537
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:38,760
I'll put this here.

538
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,270
You'll understand tomorrow.

539
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,200
Why don't you sleep on it?

540
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:21,190
I'm sorry!

541
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:28,990
What's wrong with you?
You're late!

542
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,650
Do you hear me?

543
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:35,820
Are you listening, Turtle?

544
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,000
You have a problem, Turtle?
Say something!

545
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:54,210
I'll get you fired!

546
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,600
I'd like you to come.

547
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:00,930
A live show?

548
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,150
A turtle band?

549
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,480
I'm a vocalist.

550
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,730
A vocalist!

551
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,690
I'm called Wild Ryo, as of today.

552
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,820
It says that.

553
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,410
Wild Ryo?

554
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,210
OK, we'll come.

555
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,210
Is it at a pet shop?

556
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:31,430
Ready Ryo? Take 1.

557
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,010
A week after Revolution Q's debut

558
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,560
"With the Tokyo Olympics ahead

559
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:45,480
The whole nation will
get richer and prosper

560
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:50,860
I'll try to throw away the
bitter past"

561
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,580
10 days later

562
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,540
"With my eyes closed, ears covered
and my mouth shut

563
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:05,120
But no matter how hard
I pretend to be happy...

564
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,580
Love & Peace!
I won't ever forget you!

565
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,670
Love & Peace!
I won't ever forget you!

566
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,890
Your face when you were washed away

567
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,890
You're burned into my brain

568
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:26,900
How can I go on
pretending that I'm over you!

569
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:31,780
Love & Peace!
I won't ever forget you!

570
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,740
Love & Peace!
I won't ever forget you!

571
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,000
I'd do anything to get you back now!"

572
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,080
You're incredible!

573
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:50,920
Not bad. Not bad at all.

574
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:02,390
Thanks.

575
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,390
You came.

576
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,000
- Welcome home
- Hi, Pa.

577
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,000
Turtle looks content.

578
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,080
Yeah, he does.

579
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:33,000
I'm happy for you.

580
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:40,210
Something good must have
happened out there.

581
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,940
This is the hit song, "Love & Peace".

582
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,610
It's not a wimpy love song,
it's a real song!

583
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:44,030
Revolution Q are our heroes!

584
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:49,040
He's having fun.

585
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:50,620
I bet.

586
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,130
He'll become big,
like Turtle here.

587
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,920
Right.

588
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,380
He's back.

589
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:01,380
Pa's home.

590
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,960
Welcome home!

591
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,930
Hi, Pa!

592
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,760
I'm home, children!

593
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,930
Home sweet home!

594
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:13,690
Oh, yes.

595
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:20,200
Oh, Turtle, you've grown so big!

596
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,320
Pa, Turtle is so happy.

597
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,990
Don't laugh it off.

598
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:32,700
If he gets too big
we won't have space for him.

599
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,660
Pa, listen to the song.

600
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:42,920
I think this song's
for Turtle.

601
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,470
What?
.

602
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,140
Is that why you're happy, huh?

603
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:52,100
Love & Peace!

604
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:54,470
What's wrong PC-300?

605
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:55,980
Uh, Pa...

606
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,730
Yes, Maria?

607
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:59,930
Don't be mad...

608
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,900
What is it?

609
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,280
Well...

610
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:05,730
Tell me.

611
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,110
PC-300 drank your whiskey.

612
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:10,410
What?

613
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,540
I didn't.

614
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,330
Oops!

615
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,790
OK, I did.

616
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,010
I'm drunk.

617
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,050
You...!

618
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:22,880
Hic! I'm totally drunk!

619
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:28,390
I won't ever forget you, Turtle...

620
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:31,760
Pa, can you fix him?

621
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,600
Silly old robot.

622
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:42,320
Pa, when do you think
we can leave this place?

623
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:46,740
Let's see. In about a month.

624
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,490
A month?

625
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:51,750
But I'm not a puppy anymore.

626
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,710
I can't go back home.

627
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:58,540
He's right. How can we go back?

628
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,710
Tell us!

629
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,050
I'm not a cute puppy anymore...

630
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,590
- Come on...
- It's so sad.

631
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,340
- Don't you agree, Bunny?
- Yes.

632
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,170
Pa.

633
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,640
Okay, everybody, listen up

634
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,070
Let me tell you what
I do every year.

635
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:29,370
I take care of kids
in circumstances like you

636
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,190
and help them go home.

637
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:38,790
This is like a school and
you come for a year.

638
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:46,380
Maybe I'll find you a nicer place
this time, I mean...

639
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,390
You know what I'm trying to say.

640
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,380
You know don't you?
,.

641
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:58,100
It's cosy here but
you can't stay forever.

642
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:00,050
It'd be packed with kids!

643
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,360
There'd be too many of you.

644
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:07,560
That's why we have this amount

645
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:11,610
Because you go
to a nicer place.

646
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,660
I'll help you...
You know what I mean.

647
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:23,540
I think I'm thirsty.
I need something to drink.

648
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:27,550
I'll drink some water.

649
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,760
Pa.

650
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:35,220
I'll have some water.

651
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,680
Look at me, I'm so dirty!

652
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,860
Me too!

653
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:40,890
I want to go out!

654
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,560
Guys...

655
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:45,680
Leave if you want to!

656
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:48,400
Go back to your old home.

657
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,030
Do you expect your ex-owners
to be glad to see you?

658
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:58,450
"Oh, you're home!
Come in and have some milk."

659
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,460
It won't be like that.

660
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,460
Look, Tama!

661
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:06,040
You'll end up like them!

662
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:13,800
- Don't...
- You'll go out and get caught!

663
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:17,880
If you don't want to be impounded
stay here!

664
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:40,540
"Love & Peace!
I won't ever forget you

665
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:51,170
Love & Peace!
I won't ever forget you

666
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,720
Your face when you were washed away

667
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,720
You're burned into my brain

668
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:03,680
How can I go on
pretending that I'm over you!

669
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,770
Love & Peace!
I won't ever forget you

670
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,440
Love & Peace!"

671
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,700
I can't bear this...

672
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:24,170
"I'd do anything to get you back now!

673
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:30,130
Because it's impossible
to put you behind me

674
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:36,380
Because it's impossible
to put you behind me"

675
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:08,580
Turtle...?

676
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:17,010
I can't do it!

677
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,390
Who am I kidding?

678
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:23,470
I can't write a song.

679
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,100
Help! What am I going to do?

680
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,280
Was this open...?

681
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,700
What's going on...?

682
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,690
What?

683
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,790
Pik...

684
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:56,550
Pik...

685
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,550
Pika!

686
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,010
Pikadon!

687
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:10,020
Oh, my God, you're so big!

688
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,330
Hold it there.

689
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:34,590
And...?

690
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:52,270
Lyrics?

691
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,060
What?

692
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:56,780
What is it?
What do you want?

693
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,780
"Even now - they're not - severed"

694
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:08,740
"The ties - that bind - us"

695
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,290
"There's no end - to our friendship"

696
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:21,220
"Nothing's - changed between us"

697
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,630
"That's right - we're brothers"

698
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,930
"Forever and - ever
We'll be together"

699
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:38,570
Sorry, Pika.

700
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:44,700
I was horrible to you.
Do you forgive me?

701
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:51,250
Pika...

702
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:59,050
Yes! I'll be right there!

703
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,340
Hold on!

704
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,090
Pika.

705
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:07,180
Hide under this and stay still.

706
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:13,430
Who is it? I'm in the middle
of something...

707
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:19,980
Hi. Your eyes are red.

708
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,030
- Really?
- I'll cook something.

709
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,950
No, today's no good...

710
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:27,190
What is that?

711
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,200
- Can you cook me something after all?
- What's this?

712
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:35,450
- My favorite chair. So life-like.
- It's cute...

713
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,670
Stop!

714
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:47,510
It's the latest technology.
Like clap-on lights.

715
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,640
How do you like my intro?

716
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:57,230
It's the turtle!

717
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,480
What turtle?

718
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:03,110
- The one you had at the office
- Please go.

719
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,320
- It's the turtle!
- Go!

720
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,780
It's OK. Don't be embarrassed.

721
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:13,240
- What are you talking about?
- Cute.

722
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:17,120
I'm Wild Ryo, not the Ryoichi you knew!

723
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,460
Please go!

724
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:22,750
- It's OK. It's cute!
- Go!

725
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,180
- The turtle...
- Leave!

726
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,130
Turtle!

727
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:30,930
Huh?

728
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:35,010
Pikadon, where are you?

729
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,100
Don't go yet! Pikadon!

730
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:40,610
"Gnash your teeth hard
Let's go!

731
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:43,310
Gnash your teeth hard
Let's go!

732
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,610
Now gnash and gnaw
Let's fly!

733
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:49,360
Keep 'em nice, Ga-Ga-Ga
with Gi-Gi-Gi!

734
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:52,120
Keep 'em shiny and clean!"

735
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,620
I love you all!

736
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,830
Thanks for coming to see me.

737
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,930
I want you to hear my new song.

738
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,180
From yours truly

739
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:32,110
"Even now, they're not severed
The ties that bind us

740
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:38,790
There's no end to our friendship

741
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,420
Nothing's changed between us

742
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:53,640
That's right, we're brothers
Forever and ever

743
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:56,430
We'll be together"

744
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,220
- How was I?
- The best.

745
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,480
How dare you end with a solo?

746
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,610
Relax, it'll sell.

747
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:07,950
No way. Don't put our name on
that song.

748
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:09,900
Go ahead, leave!

749
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:11,860
- Encore?
- I'll go.

750
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:18,000
We do anti-establishment songs,
not ballads!

751
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,120
Shut up! You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

752
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:32,130
Are you ready?

753
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,680
I'm all revved up now!

754
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,140
Buckle up, y'all!

755
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:54,030
"Even now they're not severed
The ties that bind us

756
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:59,320
There's no end to our friendship

757
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:03,070
Nothing's changed between us

758
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:09,840
That's right, we're brothers
Forever and ever

759
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:12,090
We'll be together"

760
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:13,630
Cheers!

761
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,010
Someone came

762
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:22,930
Ryo, it's a woman named
Yuko Terashima.

763
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,310
I don't want to see her.

764
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,940
Ryo's not here.

765
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:50,500
"Even now they're not severed
The ties that bind us

766
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:57,210
There's no end to our friendship

767
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,220
Nothing's changed between us

768
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:11,400
That's right, we're brothers
Forever and ever

769
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:14,530
We'll be together"

770
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,330
Here's the genius!
Keep making great melodies!

771
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,370
That was great.

772
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:24,410
You're the man.

773
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:31,750
They're on sale! Buy more!

774
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,040
A bargain sale.

775
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:36,180
- Clearance sale!
- No way.

776
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:41,100
You can't mark down lives.

777
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,090
They're on sale!

778
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:46,720
They are not. You'll get bored
and chuck them anyway!

779
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,640
- Go away, bum!
- Don't be deceived.

780
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:53,520
Buy one! They're on sale.

781
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,820
Hey!

782
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:57,820
Hang in there

783
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:00,780
Don't touch it.

784
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:02,740
You like reindeers?

785
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:04,750
- I love them.
- OK, go.

786
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,830
- They're my friends.
- Go away.

787
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:08,530
My friends.

788
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,210
Check this out, it's Christmas!

789
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,410
- Don't get trashed.
- Go!

790
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:17,250
They're on sale!

791
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:18,960
Oh, bull!

792
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:23,930
- They're not.
- You still here?

793
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:25,520
They're not cheap.

794
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:27,180
Are you buying?

795
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,190
You're Santa?

796
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:37,490
The next song
I want the next song...

797
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:46,150
Come on, I need the next song!

798
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:52,660
Pa, you're up working so early

799
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,210
See this gate? It's not here
to lock you in.

800
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,500
It's to protect you.

801
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:04,970
"Out in the streets
the breeze is cold

802
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:10,350
You'd be left frozen
and you know it

803
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:18,030
That's why you're
better off inside"

804
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,480
Oh, Turtle, look at you.

805
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:28,030
You're so big!

806
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:30,990
Humongous!

807
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:32,960
Turtle.

808
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:38,090
Pa says you should never
go outside

809
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:43,180
But he has to
take the new song to his owner.

810
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:47,720
Turtle...

811
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,690
Ryo, every song you write is good.

812
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:02,650
Sing something for me.

813
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,610
It's not that easy.

814
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:10,950
Recent sightings of
an unusually big creature in Tokyo

815
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:16,460
indicate that it could be a
large turtle.

816
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:20,170
Every night around midnight

817
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:25,390
the turtle has been seen
in this area.

818
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:29,170
There are photos of the turtle
on the web...

819
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:31,590
- Hello.
- Don't you want to see me?

820
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,770
Hazardous Waste

821
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:43,560
Tell me the truth What did you
think of me back then?

822
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:46,520
Answer me.

823
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,070
- I don't know...
- You mocked me.

824
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,280
Now you like me.

825
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,080
Is this about the turtle?

826
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,510
Are you ashamed about it?

827
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,960
It's not about the turtle!

828
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:28,150
"Love & Peace!
I won't ever forget you

829
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:34,700
Love & Peace!
I won't ever forget you"

830
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,800
How about another shot, Pa?

831
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:44,670
Right, Maria?

832
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:48,930
Yes. Bottoms up, Pa.
Right, PC?

833
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:52,760
Right! And you can sleep all you like!

834
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:55,600
Yay, Pa!

835
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,520
"The whole nation will
get richer and prosper

836
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:05,940
I'll try to throw away the
bitter past

837
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:15,160
With my eyes closed, ears covered
and my mouth shut

838
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:22,170
But no matter how hard
I pretend to be happy..."

839
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,750
Are you ready?

840
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:26,220
Pull!

841
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:31,510
Open gate!

842
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:42,360
"You're burned into my brain
f
your ace when you were washed away

843
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:47,650
How can I go on
pretending that I'm over you!

844
01:10:48,610 --> 01:10:54,700
Love & Peace!
I won't ever forget you"

845
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,790
Here comes the main street.

846
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,330
Turtle, now you can finally see him!

847
01:11:04,590 --> 01:11:07,830
"I'd do anything to get you back now!

848
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:12,340
Because it's impossible
to put you behind me

849
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:20,050
How can I go on
pretending that I'm over you!

850
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:27,150
I want to get you back,
Love & Peace!"

851
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:37,450
I'm going to
teach you a lesson, people!

852
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:45,250
I am Sulkie who always sulks
That's me, Sulkie!

853
01:11:45,250 --> 01:11:47,370
- How noisy!
- Hush!

854
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,500
Whoa, whoa!

855
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:52,920
Turtle?

856
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,590
The condo isn't this way.

857
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:56,890
Hey!

858
01:11:57,100 --> 01:11:59,930
Turtle what's wrong?

859
01:12:00,810 --> 01:12:02,140
Hey, Turtle!

860
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,350
Maybe this is good.

861
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:07,600
Why?
.

862
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:11,770
This will take us to
his owner's concert.

863
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:14,030
Look! It's the shop!

864
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:15,870
What?
.

865
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,240
I was at that shop before.

866
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:21,870
- Which one?
- There!

867
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:25,130
I was in the show window like them.

868
01:12:25,670 --> 01:12:26,630
So pretty

869
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:32,260
I wonder how Yuri is.
Were you a Christmas present, PC?

870
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,970
I was a birthday present.

871
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:42,260
Oh, the memories! Yuri got me
for Christmas and it was snowing.

872
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,050
- It was beautiful.
- Nice.

873
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:04,120
"Even now they're not severed
The ties that bind us"

874
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:16,790
We're almost there

875
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:20,260
Wake up, Sulkie! Come on!

876
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,230
Sulkie, we're headed
for the music venue!

877
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,770
What's wrong with that?

878
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:29,890
We can't go in.

879
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,730
Let's go back.

880
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:34,570
Turtle, stop!

881
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:42,530
You going alone?

882
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:45,830
No, you can't!

883
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:51,380
OK then. I'll go with him
so you two can go back.

884
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:53,910
Let's go, Maria.

885
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:55,870
Off it goes!

886
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:00,960
Oops! Keep moving!

887
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:06,390
Walk faster!

888
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,510
Maria!

889
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,900
PC-300, stay with Maria.

890
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,400
Aye sir!

891
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,780
Turtle!

892
01:14:16,030 --> 01:14:18,440
Get moving!

893
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:25,160
PC...

894
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,200
Let's go back.

895
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:35,380
Listen, I have an important
announcement to make.

896
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:42,890
Tonight Revolution Q will disband!

897
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,350
We are one!

898
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:52,850
We are one!

899
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,030
We are one!

900
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:10,370
Keep your cool! Not now!

901
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,370
Wait. He has a press conference.

902
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,210
Let's go.

903
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:17,460
Chill out!

904
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,130
Have a nice life.

905
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:35,570
Once you go in there
there's no turning back.

906
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:41,730
I see. This is goodbye then.

907
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:47,540
That owner of yours...

908
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:51,120
Ryo!

909
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:53,700
Don't quit!

910
01:15:56,670 --> 01:16:02,790
To maintain integrity as
an anti-war rock singer

911
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:09,190
Wild Ryo insisted on Revolution Q
disbanding.

912
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,970
Why now? How about
the others?

913
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,930
I heard there's animosity.

914
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:18,600
Ryo! Don't quit!

915
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:19,770
Well?

916
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,310
Calm down.

917
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:28,160
My rebellious
rock 'n' roller spirit

918
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:32,750
might rot while I'm
with a major label.

919
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:34,330
You going solo?

920
01:16:35,170 --> 01:16:36,460
Who are you with?

921
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,380
A turtle!

922
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:50,970
Relax. It's under control.

923
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:56,730
Believe it or not
I called him with telepathy.

924
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,560
Yes, telepathy.

925
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:08,570
You see, my next song will be
about preserving nature.

926
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:16,210
And I'd say he's a victim of
nature's violation.

927
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,840
I just thought of a new melody.

928
01:17:24,050 --> 01:17:28,470
I know. I'll ask the turtle
to sing it for us.

929
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:34,550
Little turtle can you sing it?

930
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:38,940
I'm sending you my telepathy.

931
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:06,250
That's my new song.

932
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:12,350
He sang the melody that I came up with

933
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,850
Revolution Q disbanded
so I can spread my message

934
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:23,860
about nature, nuclear issues
and war.

935
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:27,100
And the human ego.

936
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:30,820
These issues are all connected.

937
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,580
I want love & peace for the world.

938
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:38,250
That's what I sing for!

939
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:43,450
Ryo, you're so cool!

940
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:49,260
Everyone, take photos of
us together.

941
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:57,390
We're Love and Peace,
the turtle and I.

942
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,810
The turtle is Love
and I am Peace.

943
01:19:05,950 --> 01:19:09,560
Love baby, bring peace to everyone

944
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:12,150
Love & Peace!

945
01:19:13,330 --> 01:19:14,610
Love & Peace!

946
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,410
Cool, Ryo!

947
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,320
Love & Peace!

948
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:27,000
Give me a break!

949
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:31,040
Tell me about the turtle!

950
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,630
Don't shut me out!

951
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:40,560
You're not in charge!

952
01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:46,100
You exploited us!

953
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:49,690
- You're no rebel.
- You fraud!

954
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,520
You just used us!

955
01:19:55,910 --> 01:20:00,530
What are you saying?
Ryo brought you success.

956
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:05,990
You're the ones who used him.

957
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:07,840
You...

958
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,300
You're famous.
Now leave Ryo alone.

959
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:18,140
Ryoichi.

960
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,690
Aren't we friends?

961
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:25,810
Pull yourself, cry baby!
You too!

962
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:30,230
Grow up!

963
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,410
Alright, I'll let you stay.
You can play for me.

964
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:48,290
OK?

965
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:51,380
Thank you.

966
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:21,070
Fascinating.

967
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:25,830
The turtle was named Love.
He appeared with Wild Ryo...

968
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:34,370
Where's PC?

969
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:36,040
He went back.

970
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,680
Let's go.

971
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:44,890
No, there's nothing back
there for me.

972
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:49,780
Pa will worry...

973
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:51,730
He's a liar!

974
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:56,730
He promised us great things
just to silence us.

975
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,240
I don't care. I'm staying.

976
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:10,120
Why don't you all disappear!

977
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,880
That cat talked!

978
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:16,510
It's a talking cat! It talks!

979
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,800
It talked!

980
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,680
Bye-bye, Sulkie.

981
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:32,940
Maria, we're going now.

982
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:36,350
I'll stay here!

983
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:43,440
Suit yourself.

984
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,100
I must meet him once a week...

985
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,090
Right.

986
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:10,560
Love!

987
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:13,640
You're not hurt?

988
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:16,940
You can't form a band with
a turtle...

989
01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:21,780
We're one, the turtle and I!
Wait for me!

990
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:24,410
- Ryo?
- You don't get it!

991
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:25,370
Let him go!

992
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:33,620
Amazing!

993
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:36,580
What kind of mutation is this?
.

994
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:43,420
This is my treasure

995
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:13,710
What's that about?

996
01:24:18,260 --> 01:24:20,800
Wild Ryo Live on Dec. 25, 2015

997
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,470
It's snowing!

998
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:34,390
How beautiful...

999
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,230
- Look at this.
- Cute!

1000
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:40,440
So is yours.

1001
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:43,100
- Girls, let's go!
- Okay!

1002
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:53,470
That's Yuri!

1003
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:58,310
But Yuri, why...?

1004
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,150
Yuri, don't go!

1005
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:28,210
Christmas bargain sale!

1006
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:33,560
Merry Christmas!
We're having a sale!

1007
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:35,640
Why...?

1008
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,430
Yuri...

1009
01:26:56,500 --> 01:27:01,240
Why is everybody feeling down?
.
It's Christmas!

1010
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,120
Maria and Turtle have gone...

1011
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:09,260
I should have brought Maria back.

1012
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:13,300
Pa, you lied when you said
nice things were ahead.

1013
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:16,300
You made it up.

1014
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:19,010
Turtle has disappeared...

1015
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:21,560
What about Maria?

1016
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:23,230
Yeah!

1017
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:28,150
OK, kids. I know that you have
your doubts

1018
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:36,830
But I promise that
Turtle and Maria will come back.

1019
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,660
Don't worry.

1020
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:39,830
Pa...

1021
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:43,870
And something nice will happen
to all of you.

1022
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,050
I think this occasion
calls for a toast.

1023
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:55,930
I'll get you all one of my
special drinks.

1024
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:01,020
Wait here.

1025
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:09,020
Hey, what's going on with
you guys?

1026
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,980
Pa's trying to make you feel good.

1027
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:17,740
When he comes back,
pretend to have fun.

1028
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:20,660
- Okay.
- Alright.

1029
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:21,990
Copy that.

1030
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:46,480
Let's have some fun, shall we?

1031
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:49,400
Huh?

1032
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:57,190
Merry Christmas, Pa!

1033
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,700
- It's party time!
- We should do it more often!

1034
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:08,420
Merry Christmas!

1035
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:12,090
Merry Christmas, Pa!

1036
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:16,760
Take a break! Come down
for a special drink!

1037
01:29:16,970 --> 01:29:18,140
Yay!

1038
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:19,470
Go on.

1039
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,050
Thank you, Pa.

1040
01:29:25,810 --> 01:29:26,900
How about you, Gori?

1041
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:29,060
Thanks.

1042
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,400
One for you, Bear.

1043
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:35,360
This is delicious!
Thank you, Pa.

1044
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:39,740
- Hand these out.
- Shall do.

1045
01:29:46,170 --> 01:29:47,370
I'm stuck...!

1046
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:52,840
Everyone! When Maria and Turtle
came back, we'll have another party.

1047
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:54,380
Yes, let's!

1048
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:58,430
You know, I've been to the ocean.

1049
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:01,060
Really? That's amazing!

1050
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:01,060
.

1051
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:02,430
Yeah.

1052
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:06,650
Pa, there's a reindeer!

1053
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:09,610
- So there is!
- It's big!

1054
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:00,030
Goodbye.

1055
01:31:02,410 --> 01:31:03,370
Goodbye.

1056
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,170
Maria.

1057
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:53,640
Pa...

1058
01:32:57,150 --> 01:33:01,360
I might be just imagining it but

1059
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:08,620
didn't you carry me like this
once before?

1060
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:11,240
Long ago.

1061
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:17,370
Isn't that funny?

1062
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:22,760
Sweet dreams, Maria.

1063
01:34:24,610 --> 01:34:26,770
This time it'll work out.

1064
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:32,530
Don't come back here.

1065
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:51,420
Take care, Sulkie.

1066
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:56,800
You too, PC

1067
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:02,180
Have a nice life, everyone.

1068
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:30,510
Off we go!

1069
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:37,520
The dreams you give out
will return next year.

1070
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:59,320
OK, let's go!

1071
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:03,990
Wild Ryo, Live at Nippon Stadium

1072
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:16,010
At Nippon Stadium

1073
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:18,100
Tomorrow!

1074
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:21,560
Line up and hold out your ticket.

1075
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:31,070
Concert T-shirts are available

1076
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:32,820
only today!

1077
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:35,400
Ryo! Ryo! Ryo!...

1078
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:39,650
Looking good!

1079
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:53,260
Yuko, get closer!

1080
01:36:53,550 --> 01:36:54,840
Go ahead!

1081
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:58,340
Autograph, please!

1082
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:01,390
That's cool!

1083
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:11,650
My dream has outgrown
this stadium.

1084
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,410
I want to grow bigger

1085
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:16,900
You will.

1086
01:37:18,490 --> 01:37:20,080
I'll go worldwide.

1087
01:37:23,290 --> 01:37:25,830
Go to the top of the world!

1088
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,330
Ryo!

1089
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:47,600
Hello.

1090
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,770
There's Turtle!

1091
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:52,940
Turtle.

1092
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:54,940
Hello.

1093
01:37:58,990 --> 01:38:00,280
Little Turtle.

1094
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:07,410
I guess your owner has
another big wish.

1095
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:11,790
You'll grow even bigger than this!

1096
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:13,830
Won't he?

1097
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:17,050
Oh! They can't see me

1098
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:20,340
Because they only believe in science.

1099
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:26,890
Little Turtle, hang in there.

1100
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:31,470
This will end soon.

1101
01:38:34,150 --> 01:38:39,740
I'll give this to you
so you can speak for yourself.

1102
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:54,630
The goal is near.
Merry Christmas.

1103
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:59,640
I wish you happiness, Turtle.

1104
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:23,740
"Love & Peace!
I won't ever forget you"

1105
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:49,640
Welcome to the Wild Ryo Concert!

1106
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:27,600
Oh, no! Evacuate immediately!

1107
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:30,020
Just go!

1108
01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:34,270
Out of the lab!

1109
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:37,770
Come on!

1110
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,330
"Love & Peace!

1111
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:59,670
I won't ever forget you

1112
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:01,800
Love & Peace!

1113
01:41:02,130 --> 01:41:06,170
I won't ever forget you

1114
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:40,300
Love & Peace!

1115
01:41:40,460 --> 01:41:44,500
I won't ever forget you

1116
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:46,840
Love & Peace!

1117
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:51,140
I won't ever forget you

1118
01:41:51,390 --> 01:41:53,180
Love & Peace!

1119
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:57,600
I won't ever forget you"

1120
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:11,610
Live from Akihabara.

1121
01:42:11,910 --> 01:42:16,370
A giant turtle escaped a
lab and trampled Asakusa.

1122
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:18,200
It's headed west.

1123
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:25,090
It might be Love the turtle
who appeared with Wild Ryo.

1124
01:42:25,430 --> 01:42:30,140
This is Shinjuku. A state of emergency
has been declared.

1125
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:58,710
Love!

1126
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:02,160
Love leaves destruction
in his wake.

1127
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:06,630
So far no casualties
have been reported

1128
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,390
Love's slow pace meant citizens
could escape.

1129
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:13,360
To Nippon Stadium you go!

1130
01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:15,780
My hopes and dreams are with you!

1131
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:18,330
Kaiju Pikadon!

1132
01:44:19,330 --> 01:44:22,670
Go to Nippon Stadium!

1133
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:24,740
"Because it's impossible
to put you behind me

1134
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:33,920
Because it's impossible
to put you behind me"

1135
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:07,910
Pikadon...!

1136
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:16,250
I'm an iceberg.

1137
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:20,220
Are you listening to me?

1138
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:23,630
You can only see the tip of it.

1139
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:26,680
Are you listening to me?

1140
01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:28,520
Love!

1141
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:31,440
Love!

1142
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:38,520
The biggest part of me is hidden
underwater.

1143
01:47:38,860 --> 01:47:41,450
I'm actually big.

1144
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:46,700
Are you listening to me?
Ryoichi Suzuki will be big!

1145
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:52,080
I'll escape this place someday.

1146
01:47:59,510 --> 01:48:00,550
He's a star!

1147
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:06,390
A star on the rise!

1148
01:48:11,690 --> 01:48:15,100
I love Yuko Terashima!

1149
01:48:16,150 --> 01:48:20,690
I love her!
I want to date her.

1150
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:26,900
God, please!

1151
01:48:28,120 --> 01:48:30,210
He's talking about you!

1152
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:31,540
Yes!

1153
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:38,000
Pikadon?

1154
01:48:39,300 --> 01:48:40,960
Pikadon!

1155
01:48:42,430 --> 01:48:43,380
Pikadon!

1156
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:48,760
Pikadon!

1157
01:49:11,710 --> 01:49:13,040
Ryo!

1158
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:31,090
Are you OK?

1159
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:33,520
Hey, Ryo!

1160
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,310
Hey!

1161
01:49:37,190 --> 01:49:38,100
Ryo!

1162
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:41,860
Let her pass please!

1163
01:49:44,360 --> 01:49:46,150
Ryo, what's wrong?

1164
01:49:50,580 --> 01:49:51,490
Ryo...

1165
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:14,180
"Last night I slept in the car

1166
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:24,270
Holding my girl's hand

1167
01:50:26,490 --> 01:50:36,490
Parked in the city ballpark lot

1168
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:48,090
We were wrapped up in a blanket

1169
01:50:51,270 --> 01:51:01,110
On the radio a slow ballad played

1170
01:51:02,440 --> 01:51:11,030
The fog settles around the windows

1171
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:21,330
I knew nothing bad
could happen to us

1172
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:34,510
I heard her talking in her sleep

1173
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:46,190
I mean it, I really do

1174
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:20,600
On the radio a slow ballad played

1175
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:30,320
The fog settles around the windows

1176
01:52:30,740 --> 01:52:40,740
I knew nothing bad
could happen to us

1177
01:52:45,130 --> 01:52:53,720
And we both had dreams

1178
01:52:56,350 --> 01:53:02,850
Our dreams might be almost the same"

1179
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:19,530
