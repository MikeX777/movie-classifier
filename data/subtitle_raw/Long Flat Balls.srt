1
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,835
THE CZECH REPUBLIC - NORWAY

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,716
Hey, guys... If Norway wins, I'll buy
all of you a trip to the World Cup!

3
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,236
Hey, Edgar!
You'll have to stick to your promise!

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,750
No, there won't be any trip.
The EdGarage hasn't got the money.

5
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,999
Itjust popped out of me.
You'll just have to start saving, guys.

6
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,318
Doesn't the EdGarage
have any money, Edgar?

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,354
7 MONTHS LATER

8
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,316
Kurt Nilsen here on P4. 20,000
supporters are now in Germany.

9
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,753
And there's at least half a million
who'd wish they were there...

10
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,914
- Quit stealing!
- I was just getting some change!

11
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,999
There's a lot less there.
What did you do with all the money?

12
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,876
- I needed money for the parking metre!
- Won't get to the World Cup with this.

13
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,152
What was that all about?

14
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,315
Who was that last guy?

15
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,037
- Did you hear what he said, Edgar?
- No, he whispered.

16
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,959
If I was supposed to hear it,
it's stupid to whisper.

17
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,312
Are you always this bloody hilarious?
But that's not why we are here.

18
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,038
We're sick of this!
Mobekken is sick of this damn crap.

19
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,710
When you sell on commission,
that doesn't mean it's your money.

20
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,869
I know you're thick, Edgar, but I
never thought you'd be this stupid.

21
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,029
You've got 30 days to come up with
the money and put them on the table.

22
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,312
If not, we'll take over this...

23
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,310
Mobekken takes over
this entire goddamn shop here!

24
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,795
My wife is a partner here too.

25
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,834
She'd better prepare herself
for a change of partners.

26
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,508
- Have you seen her?
- No, but...

27
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,271
If I were you, I'd pass.
Thirty days!

28
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,393
Damn it, he doesn't understand
a damn shit, that little gnome.

29
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,990
Do you understand
what we're telling you!

30
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,558
I've heard something about you, Edgar.
You havn't got any kids yet.

31
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,197
And if you can't settle this in thirty
days, you can forget about that.

32
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,949
No sacks, no kids!

33
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,517
- Did you hear him?
- Yeah, he didn't whisper this time.

34
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,310
- Kari, come into the storage room.
- Edgar, what's going on?

35
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,636
That was Mobekken and his goon.
We owe them a lot of money.

36
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,719
- We haven't borrowed any...
- I wasn't talking about a loan.

37
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,798
I owe him commission for car sales, -

38
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,993
- but I've spent the money
on salaries et cetera.

39
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,910
- How much money are we talking about?
- 890,000.

40
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,475
And with caps, too, fashionable.

41
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,070
If you buy today,
you'll get winter and summer tires.

42
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,193
He'll get there quicker
with new rubber, you know...

43
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,675
If you'll just sign here.

44
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,953
- OK, we'll take care of it.
- And there goes the Volvo!

45
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,637
- There goes the Volvo anyway.
- That's great, Øyvind.

46
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:39,920
Hello!

47
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,480
Hello!

48
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,719
- Won't get to the World Cup with this.
- No, we'll need a miracle.

49
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,230
For example, you could start
selling cars to women.

50
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,315
Hey, wake up. Back to work!
Looking slack.

51
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,352
Hi!

52
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,473
I'd like to buy a car.

53
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,395
And there goes the Opel?

54
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,478
Øyvind, come into the office.

55
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,676
- Why do you only sell cars to men?
- They're the ones who buy cars.

56
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,634
We do have quite a few women
who want to buy cars.

57
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,633
Jesus Christ! Here's a list
of 15 cars, three months...

58
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,868
- Well, that's quite a few.
- Sure, but they're all men.

59
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,709
I can't see any ladies
anywhere in here.

60
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,674
What's your problem?

61
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,271
- It's not that easy to sell to...
- Tell me what's troubling you.

62
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,312
- I haven't shagged.
- What?

63
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,876
I haven't shagged.

64
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,999
There are lots of people
who haven't shagged.

65
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,192
- Really?
- But we can fix that.

66
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,837
- We might be going to Germany.
- Yeah, that would be nice.

67
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,076
All right?

68
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,317
I had my debut in Germany, too.

69
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,308
Norway will go far
in the World Cup, you know!

70
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,389
But being in the World Cup
is an accomplishment in itself...

71
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,594
- 4 summer tires and 8 winter tires...
- We're out of toilet paper, too.

72
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,031
Tonight's the crucial game
in the group play-offs!

73
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,598
- It's time for playing wide!
- What does that mean?

74
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,920
We're talking about how
the ball moves along the surface.

75
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,831
- It should be a completely flat pass.
- Just say so, then.

76
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,678
You must have heard it before.

77
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,915
Is it possible to be that stupid...

78
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,194
Guys! I have good news and bad news.
Which do you want to hear first?

79
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,996
Let's hear the bad news first,
and then move up to the good news.

80
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,034
If we start with the good news,
then it falls...

81
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,919
OK, guys! I'll decide.

82
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,232
- You will get a new boss.
- And the bad news is?

83
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,673
- I have to sell the EdGarage.
- You're selling the EdGarage, Edgar?

84
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,149
I've got a problem with Mobekken Auto.
Breach of contract and so on.

85
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,636
But we've plenty to do.
Busy like hell!

86
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,879
Yes, but the cars that have been sold,
were sold on commission.

87
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,200
The money he was supposed to get,
I had to spend on pay checks.

88
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,029
What's the good news then?

89
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,394
If we win tonight,
I'd like to buy you a trip to Germany.

90
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,950
Without the women!

91
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,948
What are you laughing at?
You haven't even shagged yet!

92
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,071
There goes the wistle!
Norway has defeated the USA!

93
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,671
Norway has advanced
to the round of 16 finals!

94
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,112
Take out a mortgage on the house,
and come to Germany!

95
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,793
See this?
We're driving it to Germany, guys.

96
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,309
Open the hood, Edgar!

97
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,360
- Is it a two- or four-port?
- What do you think? It's four!

98
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,999
Do you have a couple of minutes?

99
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,193
That was really cool
with the trip to the World Cup.

100
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,030
Have you thought about
how we'll get there and stuff?

101
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,518
I know a nice route,
if we drive down through Hamburg...

102
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,158
- That's the easiest way to get there.
- Something else on your mind?

103
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,478
Well, we could...
swing by the Reeperbahn.

104
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,390
Look around a bit, you know.
Wouldn't that be cool?

105
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,149
- What about Laila?
- She's not interested in football.

106
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,557
And me, I don't look at other women.

107
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:11,151
- How is it with you two, by the way?
- Oh, things are... they're great.

108
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,115
Lots of sex and stuff, you know,
it's brilliant, really...

109
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,109
Oh, Lord...

110
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,393
- Do you have a couple of minutes?
- Sure, Kai. Sit down.

111
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,717
I've thought about Mobekken Auto.

112
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,076
This trip to Germany was really nice
of you. Lots of good food and stuff...

113
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,637
- I think it could be fun.
- I'm looking forward to it!

114
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,389
- I think it'll be nice.
- A real blast.

115
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,071
But terrible that you may have to sell
your life's work. It makes me nervous.

116
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,795
- That's just the way it is, Kai.
- But that Mobekken...

117
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,039
- He probably needs a good mechanic?
- Do you mean yourself?

118
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,233
What about your drinking?
Have you quit, or...?

119
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,797
Yeah, sure, sure.
Haven't had a drink for ages.

120
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,151
- And I can trust you on that?
- Those times have gone.

121
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,353
Christmas Eve,
New Year's Eve, Easter Eve...

122
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,951
Midsummer's night...
Your birthdays...

123
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,915
Then I don't see why you should be
nervous. I'll put in a word for you.

124
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,193
That would be nice of you, Edgar.
And I'm looking forward to the trip.

125
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,554
- Don't go around being nervous.
- Thanks, Edgar. I'll go pack, then.

126
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,636
Boy!

127
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,316
- Do you have two minutes?
- Sure. Come in.

128
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,159
It's about that trip to Germany.

129
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,196
There's not much left!
I only got 250 euros for 2,000.

130
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,712
- Can you buy as much with them?
- A lot more. Germany is cheap.

131
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,714
- Now, tell the guys.
- I'm not going to Germany.

132
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,070
You're not going to Germany?

133
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,717
No, I've landed some gigs.
I've got to focus on my music.

134
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,629
- But we're going to the World Cup!
- But I don't even like football!

135
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,073
Everybody likes football, you too.
It's just that you don't know it yet!

136
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,397
So now we're one man short!

137
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,831
- Which letter were you again?
- N.

138
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,830
- Have you ever heard of "Orway"?
- But you have room for two letters.

139
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,597
Damn it, I'll show you two letters!
Let go of me, God damn it! Hey!

140
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,270
- Do you have ten minutes?
- Yeah.

141
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,951
About that trip to Germany...
I need an advance pay, Edgar.

142
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,436
I'm broke as usual, you know.

143
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,953
I can't give you an advance
as long as you are on sick leave.

144
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,119
I can work for black money
and then get an advance out of that!

145
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,515
We both benefit.

146
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,475
You might not have a job to take
sick leave from when you get back.

147
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,952
- Hello.
- I can't live here anymore!

148
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,358
This goddamn racket!
She's crazy!

149
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,394
- I can't can take it anymore!
- Here he comes again.

150
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,511
Dirtbag!

151
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:10,396
Damn dago-soppy-crap!

152
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,035
Just put it on the bill, OK?

153
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,439
Hi, mum.

154
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,078
Well, well! What's this? After Eight?
I don't like After Eight!

155
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,158
- And are those flowers for me?
- Yes...

156
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,318
I am allergic to roses!

157
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,878
But then you've never given me
any roses before! Sit closer!

158
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,359
Do what your mother tells you!
Look, your hair is even thinner.

159
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,633
Stop that noise over there already!
All you do is go to football games.

160
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:02,868
Can't get yourself a woman at football
games! You have to ask them out.

161
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,675
- But I have to meet the one first...
- At a football game?

162
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,316
And besides, you have me,
so you don't need anybody else!

163
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,433
- Will you stop that horrible music!
- If you go over there and talk...

164
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,189
You're exactly like your father.
No, you're not really.

165
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,632
Your father was tall and handsome,
and he had lots of hair on his head.

166
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,958
But you are similar in that he travelled
the country to see horseraces, -

167
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,994
- and you have that football of yours.
Stop making that noise!

168
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,149
Hear that? They're killing me...
When are you going to take me home?

169
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,954
Us guys are going on
a football trip to Germany.

170
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,551
Germany? Only drinking and
whores there... Can't you just stop it!

171
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,959
Good grief... If you can't stop,
then I'll have to put out the electricity!

172
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,435
NORWAY - ARGENTINA

173
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,950
May Berit Bergh rest in peace.

174
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,110
About that trip to Germany,
I really need an advance.

175
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,678
We've talked about this before.
This is a funeral, Karsten...

176
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,398
Poor Øyvind!
First the EdGarage and...

177
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,833
- And then FFK lost this weekend.
...and then this with his mother.

178
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,511
- And they were in the lead, too!
- Edgar, I need to get an advance.

179
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,588
Could you move a bit,
I'm covering up this hole here.

180
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,874
- At least give me five minutes!
- I'm going home to watch the game.

181
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,989
Is Mrs. Bergh doing better now?

182
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,478
She's dead.

183
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,395
You guys are finished
with these, right?

184
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,999
Excuse me,
I have to go to the bathroom.

185
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:56,237
Norway is 2-1 up against Argentina,
another South American team...

186
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,556
Come on, Øyvind!

187
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,639
Øyvind! Øyvind! Øyvind!

188
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,037
- Go on, grab a beer, Øyvind!
- And the vicar!

189
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,676
Vicar! Vicar! Vicar!

190
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,553
Edgar! Edgar!

191
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,996
Olé, olé, olé!

192
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,478
Guys... Guys!
I have a new N.

193
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,875
Helge!

194
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,956
Here's the guy who's going
to replace Freddy, guys.

195
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,910
This is Helge, my nephew,
a real party boy...

196
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,032
He's a member of the Free Church.

197
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,639
- Helge.
- Satan.

198
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,791
See you tomorrow.

199
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,916
Mummy!

200
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,598
Petter? What would you say
if we were going to have a kid?

201
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,076
Yes! Yes, wonderful!

202
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,477
Did you see that? In the top corner
from thirty metres! Straight in!

203
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,275
- Do you want me to rewind it?
- No, that's OK.

204
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,791
Wanna go to bed?

205
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,468
So it was the real deal, then...

206
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:04,390
And remember to change underwear
and socks everyday.

207
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,272
Now?

208
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,553
I'll throw in some detergent in case
you need to get some stains out.

209
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,910
- Hi, Øyvind.
- Hi.

210
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,673
I've been thinking...
I'm not going to Germany.

211
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,749
I have some stuff to take care of
after mum's funeral and...

212
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,872
But I'll come down to Gothenburg, -

213
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,950
- and I'll tell the guys myself,
so you won't have to tell them.

214
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,277
I understand, Øyvind.

215
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,156
And maybe buy
some cheap bacon too.

216
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,749
Bye.

217
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,270
I don't think this trip was meant
to happen. First, I get us a new N...

218
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,109
- Now we're one O short.
- So that was Øyvind at the door?

219
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,313
- Now he tells me he's not going.
- That's understandable.

220
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,559
- We're leaving early tomorrow.
- He couldn't see this coming.

221
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,469
I wonder if it's a sign...

222
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:14,118
I could come along, you know.
I can take my top off, too.

223
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,069
Just one thing... Now that we
are going to the World Cup and all...

224
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,273
We've talked about
a break sometimes...

225
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,597
Is it OK if I take
that break now?

226
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,031
- Yeah, that's fine!
- It's fine?

227
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,471
- Sure, we can take a break.
- We? But...

228
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,319
Bye now, Petter!

229
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,632
I meant that I should take a break,
not both of us! Hello? Hello!

230
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,470
- Darn it!
- Thanks, I'll take that.

231
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,037
We're going to have a nice time
without mobile phones.

232
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,870
- Well, OK, 15 minutes a day.
- 15 minutes?

233
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,119
Phone. Thanks.
Bye!

234
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,276
Bye!

235
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,756
- Bloody hell... This is my seat!
- I get carsick from sitting in the back.

236
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,511
- Do you think I care? Get lost!
- But, I get stomach pains from it.

237
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,236
- You think you're so special?
- Yes, we are all special.

238
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,317
Jesus...

239
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,829
OK, let's go, guys!

240
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,918
And water for you!

241
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,954
- Here, Øyvind!
- Wanna listen to some music?

242
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,878
Is that Neil Young?

243
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,558
I was wandering in the dark,
when Jesus called me to salvation...

244
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,911
- Fucking hell!
- Turn that music off!

245
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,270
No...

246
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,474
Hallelujah.

247
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,276
Hallelujah.

248
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,438
Hallelujah.

249
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,158
Edgar, about those 15 minutes...

250
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:57,639
If I accumulate those during four days
can I talk for an hour on the last day?

251
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,719
Maybe I'll want to talk
15 times one minute per day.

252
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,674
I don't even have a mobile.
You can have my minutes.

253
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,476
- Then everyone gets 20 minutes!
- No, 15 minutes, take it or leave it.

254
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,036
Kai may want to call later, too.

255
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,997
Will you or Mobekken be the owner of
the EdGarage when we return, Edgar?

256
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,676
It's making me nervous.

257
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,398
Nice.

258
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,357
- When are you going to tell the guys?
- It's not that easy...

259
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,552
You should tell them
before we get on board.

260
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,311
Sure. I'll just go out
for some air first.

261
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,349
- Sorry!
- Sorry, it was my fault.

262
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,512
Here.

263
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,518
Thanks.

264
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:43,513
You take good care of it, OK?

265
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,349
I'd very much like to see it again.

266
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,194
Come on, Edgar, let's go!

267
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,031
To Germany, of course!

268
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,310
- Beer!
- One beer!

269
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,192
Water.

270
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,235
Guys, cabins...
Petter, Karsten and Øyvind.

271
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,558
Hell no, I can't share with Karsten.
He farts like all hell broke loose.

272
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,753
Do you want my intestines to explode?
The air's got to come out, right?

273
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,474
Kai, you'll stay with Helge and me.

274
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:42,596
We'd like to inform our passengers
that the duty free shop is open.

275
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,758
The waterjust goes straight through me.
I need to go to the loo.

276
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,914
I need my phone.
And then I'll have three minutes left.

277
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,160
Hi, uncle Edgar.

278
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,798
- Hi...
- Hi, Karsten.

279
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,116
I'd like an orange juice.

280
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,833
- Henrik!
- Cheers! Bottoms up!

281
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,278
Oh, that was the best orange juice.
Can I please have another?

282
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,516
Incredible...

283
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,152
Coach Hareide can't keep making
substitutes at the 83rd minute.

284
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,796
- Got to make a call.
- That won't do it!

285
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,871
What's up with him?

286
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,834
He was going to look at women
and Reeperbahn and all that, -

287
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,555
- and now he's
calling home all the time.

288
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,475
- Hi, Petter! Are you all right?
- Yeah!

289
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,435
Hi, it's Petter again.
Call me when you get the time. Bye.

290
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,551
- Are you feeling sick?
- No... Did you get hold of Laila?

291
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:53,950
No. She won't answer.
I think she is... trying to avoid me.

292
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,631
I'll just be there a little later on.

293
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,233
Hi!

294
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,876
How are you?

295
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,629
I got a huge bump.
Did you get one?

296
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,831
Can I touch it?

297
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,635
Oh, it's big!
Wanna feel mine?

298
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,115
Are you seasick?

299
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,517
No, no. Our family's
got salt water in our bloo...

300
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,239
I'm such a happy Christian, Karsten!

301
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,149
- Come on!
- He's calling for you.

302
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,238
Hallelujah!

303
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,155
Karsten!

304
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,873
- I don't know what happened.
- I have my suspicions, Helge.

305
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,355
Uncle Edgar, please...

306
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,873
Kai wasn't in his cabin all night.
I think he started drinking again.

307
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,072
We'll have to check
when we get off the boat.

308
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,310
We're all special, you know.

309
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,072
Cool moves you had yesterday.
Do you think you can teach us?

310
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,748
Yeah, I suppose.

311
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,353
- No, not like that.
- Not like this?

312
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,759
With jumping.
Good, like that.

313
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,555
They haven't seen Kai.
We have to go through customs.

314
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,751
When we're through customs,
we'll find Kai and get out of here.

315
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,872
And nobody mess
with these guys.

316
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,638
Out of the car! Out!

317
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,790
Look at this.
Just his size, huh?

318
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,275
What's that?

319
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,439
That's deter...

320
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,512
Bingo.

321
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,076
- And what might this be?
- It is dete...

322
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,912
Cavity search! All of them!

323
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:36,030
Guys, I'm going into the police station
to ask about Kai. You stay here.

324
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:47,475
What letter does Kai have again?
In case we have to replace him.

325
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,519
Kai's been arrested.
For attempted child abduction.

326
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,032
- Attempted child abduction?
- I can't talk to him until tomorrow.

327
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,313
- What about tonight's game?
- We're not leaving without Kai.

328
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,399
- What about those expensive tickets?
- I haven't bought any tickets yet.

329
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,798
- They weren't that easy to get.
- You haven't bought any tickets?

330
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,516
No, but I'll get them.
I've got connections down there.

331
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,674
There are more important things
in life than football.

332
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,998
And those things are...?

333
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,832
This is where we're staying.
Should we check out our rooms first, -

334
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,316
- or should we find a pub
showing football and go there?

335
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,991
- I for one need to go up to our room.
- To put on some ladies' underwear?

336
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:54,239
- It's my mum's.
- As if that's any better.

337
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,116
- I wasn't going to come along.
- Huh?

338
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,995
I used the bag as a cover-up-bag.
I brought her bag to...

339
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,670
- Are you going to betray us?
- I was going to tell you in Gothenburg.

340
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,238
- We would've been one letter short.
- You can't betray your mates!

341
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,477
We're in the World Cup and all...

342
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,638
Betrayer! Judas!

343
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,911
- We are yelling at Øyvind.
- This is our mate.

344
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:27,636
You shut up, when we're yelling at him.
Now, where were we?

345
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,675
- Oh yeah. Betraying us.
- I can take some bags up with me.

346
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,915
Good day. May I help you?

347
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,509
Norway... yes...

348
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,075
Wenche Myhre.

349
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,919
Derrick.

350
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,355
There are some seats over there.

351
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,915
Bye.

352
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,195
Six beers, please.

353
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,799
Here you go.

354
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,913
There you are, Edgar, thanks.

355
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,478
- There are lots of Germans here.
- Lots of Germans in Germany.

356
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,351
A toothbrush.

357
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,074
They're showing all the highlights, -

358
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,193
- and tonight, it's the quarter finals.
It's gonna be great!

359
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,437
- But Øyvind's in his room.
- Call him on his mobile.

360
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,111
- I've got his phone right here, so...
- That's right.

361
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:38,075
- I'll get him, but I want my mobile.
- You're out of minutes to call.

362
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,796
- I've got three minutes.
- Karsten's right.

363
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,390
- How do you know?
- I just do.

364
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,477
Give me my mobile.

365
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,072
But guys...

366
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,832
Even if he brings Øyvind back
with him, we're still one A short.

367
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,036
- Been here long?
- I... I just came.

368
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,919
- I... came just now.
- Get a move on, put some clothes on.

369
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:34,398
The guys are waiting at the pub.
The game starts any minute now.

370
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,999
Hello, it's Petter again.

371
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,352
Please call me
when you get this message...

372
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,516
Bye.

373
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:55,870
I've really screwed up this time.
Laila won't even answer the phone.

374
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,993
She's not returning my calls.
I don't know what to do.

375
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,273
I think she's messing around
with other guys. Yeah, I do.

376
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,268
- The elevator...
- Hurry in, then.

377
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,828
- The paint, Edgar.
- OK, go to the loo. I'll get the guys.

378
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,759
I don't know what to do.
Laila won't return my calls...

379
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,796
- Are you going to wear that?
- Yeah, isn't it nice enough?

380
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,196
We've found a German
who can be A.

381
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,198
- He's as good as gold.
- He's dead drunk!

382
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,110
- Hurry up, we're running out of time.
- Off with his clothes, let's paint.

383
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,957
Norway has defeated
England in Hamburg.

384
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,873
- Did you see that goal?
- Really awesome.

385
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,311
What the hell's Edgar doing?

386
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,196
We've got to thank this guy.
What's "thank you" in German?

387
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,637
It's "danke".

388
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,436
- Are you Norwegian?
- Sure, I'm from Sarpsborg.

389
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,788
Øyvind, what's this extra bill
for 100 Euros on your room?

390
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,190
It's for a toothbrush.

391
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,952
100 Euros for a toothbrush?
Electrical, or what?

392
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,829
Thanks a fucking lot, Kai.
Now move it!

393
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,794
Kai, you idiot.
You wrecked our entire quarter final.

394
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,834
- Sinner.
- No, come on, now.

395
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,114
- Hey, you be quiet.
- Petter... I think he's got the picture.

396
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,474
But I've got a little secret.
South Korea didn't advance, -

397
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,434
- so I bought their tickets
for the semi finals.

398
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,839
- You've taken the wrong road, Edgar.
- It's just a quick detour, guys.

399
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,397
- I want to show you a beautiful church.
- And where exactly is this church?

400
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:39,435
- Well, it's in Rostock.
- That's 200 kilometres extra!

401
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,474
- What if we miss the game?
- When did you become religious?

402
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,310
It's just old memories, Petter,
from back when I was a sailor.

403
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,719
We're going to church, uncle Edgar?
Thanks, uncle Edgar.

404
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,475
Damn, look at that restaurant, guys.
I am so unbelievably hungry.

405
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,559
Forget it. It's the most expensive
restaurant in this entire country.

406
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,914
Let's go into the church. Many years'
worth of culture to see. Come on.

407
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,951
Karsten!

408
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,719
You don't smoke in church!

409
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,549
Put it out.
It's about respect.

410
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,391
"...our beloved parents in peace".

411
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,671
Where's he going?

412
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,235
Guys!
Time for food! Over there!

413
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,474
- I have to talk to you.
- There's nothing to talk about.

414
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,319
Our son.

415
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,115
Whom you have not seen
in twenty years.

416
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,876
He's doing fine.

417
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,875
- Every day should be like this.
- I am so full.

418
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,880
Here comes uncle Edgar.

419
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,310
What the hell is this?

420
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,439
Edgar... come here for a second.
Come on...

421
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,751
What is it?

422
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,711
It's good that you had
a nice time, guys.

423
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:12,117
I was really against this, Edgar.

424
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:17,440
This money was for tonight's hotel.
And you sat here and drank it up.

425
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,440
Damn it!

426
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:38,316
- It wasn't me!
- What do you think you're doing!

427
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,956
What is it, guys?

428
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,950
- What the hell have you eaten, Kai?
- It still hangs in the air.

429
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,551
- Did you fart like this in jail, too?
- You leave him alone!

430
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,196
Edgar, you have to stop here.
I need to pee.

431
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,914
Yeah, me too.

432
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,517
Anne...

433
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,913
Go Norway.

434
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,519
Øyvind, they had electric toothbrushes
in there, at 18.90 Euros.

435
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,349
Man, have you been fooled!

436
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,752
Damn, we have the police behind us.

437
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,679
- Stop the car!
- This is going straight to hell!

438
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,873
You guys sit calmly in the car,
and I'll talk to him.

439
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,674
You guys shut up.

440
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:09,793
Put that bottle away!

441
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,673
It reeks of alcohol in here.

442
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:22,158
He says it smells
of alcohol in here, guys.

443
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,476
Better now?

444
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,671
Out of the car!

445
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,590
- There went another 50 Euros.
- It's impossible for Karsten to shut up.

446
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,112
- Will we make it to the game on time?
- I got us the tickets...

447
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,996
I'll make sure we get there on time.
Start painting yourselves, guys.

448
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,512
Come on, guys! Looks like
the game has started already!

449
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,672
What the hell...?

450
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,396
Edgar! It's the wrong semi final!

451
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:08,830
Edgar! Wrong game!

452
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,191
- Good seats.
- But it's the wrong game!

453
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,516
A game is a game.

454
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,112
- Yeah, a game is a game...
- Not when it's the wrong one, it's not.

455
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:40,159
And Norway scores! 2-2,
and we've played for sixty minutes...

456
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,433
Thank you. That was "Prison".
And now one of my new songs.

457
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,757
Here's "My Life".

458
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,953
This sucks, Edgar!
We're missing out on Norway's game!

459
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:00,516
I can call Kari, so we can watch
the game on the phone.

460
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,951
Hello, Kari.
Could you hold the phone up to the TV?

461
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,277
Up to the TV,
so we can watch the game.

462
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,040
I thought you were at the game?

463
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,470
Hang on, I'll hold it up for you.

464
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,832
This is very, very exciting. Here's
John Arne Riise in a good stride.

465
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:26,431
Riise's had a good game for Norway...

466
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:39,313
- What do you think you're doing!
- We can't hear a damn thing!

467
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,640
- Can't you keep it down?
- I'll take care of it, guys. Go back in.

468
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:50,794
When I booked you, I didn't know that
Norway would reach the semi finals.

469
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,552
- But I'm playing rock'n'roll.
- Let's just go in and watch the game.

470
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,190
Score's 2-2,
Norway's got the advantage...

471
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:08,190
And it's a goal! 3-2 Norway
by Thorstein Helstad...

472
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,873
This is a magical moment
in Norwegian sports history!

473
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,117
3-2 against Sweden.

474
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,869
The display of happiness
is understandable.

475
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,436
This is Norwegian sports at its best.

476
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,996
We have just received news
about six Norwegians in Dortmund.

477
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,760
Have they gone to the wrong game?

478
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,112
Because that's Germany
against South Africa.

479
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,630
But football is football,
a game's a game.

480
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,276
It's not this game.

481
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,756
My game.

482
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,191
Mein Kampf.

483
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,068
Carew, and it goes wide...

484
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,518
Bittman, Bittman, Bittman...!

485
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,316
And there goes the whistle!
We are in the final!

486
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:31,389
We now have a match
against Germany in Berlin!

487
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,637
We're in the final, guys!

488
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,796
Two beers, please.

489
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,832
There's that substitute
who scored the final goal.

490
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:12,271
Klaus Bittman.

491
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:04,918
This is a really dodgy neighbourhood,
so I had to watch our luggage.

492
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,919
I'm going after the guys to Germany.
I need a car.

493
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:18,159
Take any car you like, Freddy.
And you need to take this with you...

494
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:04,151
Stop the damn car.

495
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,229
Guys, what were you thinking?

496
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:19,355
- Damn it, Edgar, he's an adult.
- And we did leave money for him.

497
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:24,799
Edgar, he deserved it.
He was an embarassment to the gang.

498
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,436
To all of Norway.
You heard what he said to the Germans.

499
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:34,875
Of all that we've been through,
this must be the most insanely...

500
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:39,915
...funny thing I've ever heard!
Should've done it ages ago!

501
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:19,914
Let's pull over to this side here, guys.
I think we're lost.

502
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,879
Petter, you have a new text message.
It's from Freddy.

503
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,436
"Hi, Petter. I'm not sure
if I should tell you this, -

504
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:42,829
- but the other night,
I met Laila with another guy."

505
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,112
- Give me my phone.
- Sorry, Petter.

506
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,710
I want to be alone now.

507
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,876
Petter...

508
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,117
I know how you feel.

509
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,312
Petter, wait a minute.

510
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:11,152
- Might as well get off here, guys,
- I'll stay here in the van, Edgar.

511
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:14,989
There are so many bars here.
It's making me nervous.

512
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,829
I'm not moving an inch,
until I get something to eat.

513
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:22,191
I've got a low blood sugar level.

514
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:31,669
- I told you I wanted to be alone.
- We are alone now...

515
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,514
Edgar.

516
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,075
- Yeah?
- What are you up to now, Edgar?

517
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:52,558
I'll go get something
for your blood sugar levels.

518
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:57,515
- Trust Edgar to fix your blood sugar.
- Yeah, Edgar fixes most things, Kai.

519
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,714
May I be of assistance to you?

520
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:34,510
- What on earth is he up to?
- I think I know, but I can't tell you.

521
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,234
I can't tell you, either.

522
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,035
Hey, boy!

523
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,268
You can go.

524
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,559
I haven't ordered anything.

525
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,353
Klaus...

526
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,798
Give me the phone.

527
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,748
I was so looking forward to this trip,
and then I screw it up.

528
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:59,558
Damn it, I regret it.
Asking Laila for a break.

529
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,389
I don't know what I was thinking.

530
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,070
Now she won't even
answer when I call.

531
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:12,516
Have you tried dialling +47 first?

532
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,479
I'm such an idiot, Øyvind.

533
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:23,199
Had the finest woman in the world, right
under my nose. Still I didn't see her.

534
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,831
What took you so long, Edgar.
It made me really nervous.

535
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:42,511
I'm bloody starving to death. Did you
bring anything for my blood sugar?

536
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,837
- I forgot.
- You don't forget things like that.

537
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:49,077
So this is all about you, then?

538
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,751
I arrange for us to go to Germany, and
all you do is think about yourselves.

539
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,589
It's always you, you, you,
and I've had it!

540
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,839
- I think I've lost her forever.
- I've never had anybody.

541
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,713
Never? Not once?

542
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,799
Almost... just once.

543
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:21,035
I'm not lucky with the ladies. Maybe
that's why I can't sell cars to them.

544
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:25,870
- Well, it's hard to tell.
- Can you be gay and not know it?

545
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:31,074
Do you get a tingling sensation
downstairs when you see naked guys?

546
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,555
I've never seen
a naked guy before.

547
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:45,194
Feel anything?
Nothing?

548
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,915
That was nice...

549
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:58,156
Hi.

550
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,875
Don't get the wrong idea.
I'm not...

551
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,119
- He's the reason we're here.
- Me?

552
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:11,269
That's fine, Øyvind.
There's nothing wrong with that.

553
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:15,268
- We were just here to check if...
- He was the one who wanted to try.

554
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:20,952
You don't have to excuse yourself
to me. Maybe I'll see you around.

555
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:31,594
I don't want her to think that I'm gay.
You're the one who's uncertain.

556
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:38,671
- Thanks a lot!
- Øyvind, come on...

557
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,875
- What will you do now?
- Go home.

558
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:31,631
To see if I have a home
to come home to.

559
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,356
Instead of spending several weeks
walking home, -

560
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,793
- let's go home tomorrow, after
the game, with Edgar and the guys.

561
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,311
Huh?

562
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,359
- Don't you agree? It's better that way.
- Sure...

563
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:56,873
- Damn it, I've never had anybody!
- No... Poor thing...

564
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:02,200
But we were on a break, and
I was the only one wanting a break...

565
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,311
- Are you up already, Edgar?
- I haven't had any shut-eye all night.

566
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,353
I think Kari knows.

567
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:40,475
Every year, someone sent Klaus
Christmas and birthday presents.

568
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:47,148
The only one who knows, is you.

569
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,638
Did you say anything to Kari?

570
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:57,790
- While you were drunk?
- You don't lie to Kari.

571
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,996
I'll take my 15 minutes, now.

572
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,834
Father.

573
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,349
Klaus...

574
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:56,520
- This is my son, Klaus.
- Hello, Klaus.

575
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:01,314
Klaus, we have to go now.

576
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,433
I'd like to introduce my father.

577
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:12,075
- Klaus, we really have to go now.
- OK, just a minute.

578
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:25,114
Damn, that son of yours is all right,
letting us borrow this suite.

579
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:30,599
- Let me see your suite?
- I could have two letters, guys.

580
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,429
- Why don't we just paint "Norge"?
- "Norge"?

581
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:43,353
Freddy's here, guys!

582
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,475
- When did you come here?
- Just now.

583
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:56,071
- It's some important lawyer-stuff.
- Not as important as the World Cup!

584
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:07,750
We'd better move it, guys,
the game starts soon.

585
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:11,999
- I can't flush, Edgar.
- Let's have a look, move.

586
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:16,716
But for fuck's sake, Kai,
you've been shitting in the bidee!

587
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,035
Nice of Klaus to get us these
good seats. Look at that stadium!

588
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,674
We've beaten Argentina
and England.

589
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:47,998
Now we're here in a packed
Olympic Stadium in Berlin.

590
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:52,159
There are 10,000 Norwegians
here today. There's the team...

591
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:56,114
Og now for the national anthem.

592
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:59,437
Hats off, guys!

593
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:33,197
Norway, with no key players.
Germany, of course, huge favourites.

594
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,953
And so, the World Cup final
of 2006 begins.

595
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:42,597
The Germans are coming on strong
right from the start.

596
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:50,273
Panic save!
And here comes Germany again...

597
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,357
Isn't he offside?

598
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,953
That was close! Another wrong pass.
The Norwegian defense is on thin ice.

599
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,310
What's going on?

600
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,991
Do you see the same as I do?
This is a one-way street!

601
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,356
The Norwegians, yeah,
let them come.

602
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,952
Norway is under
enormous pressure.

603
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,196
No!

604
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:23,994
Penalty! Wonderful!

605
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:37,392
This is Norway at their most
unmotivated and unwilling ever.

606
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:42,276
If we win this, I will walk barefoot
back home to Norway.

607
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,233
We'll just have to hope for
something better in the second half...

608
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,555
Only celebrities, guys.

609
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,197
- I'm nervous, Edgar.
- Relax, Kai, it'll be all right.

610
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,150
Thank you.

611
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:26,038
Nice outfit.
Hello...

612
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:30,836
Listen, I don't work here.
I'm on a football trip with the guys.

613
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:35,477
- Are you interested in football?
- Yeah, sure. That's why I'm here.

614
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,912
To meet real,
down-to-earth people like you.

615
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:46,070
I'm working on this book about
people and high-level sports...

616
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:51,229
I'm trying to focus on people
like you, who... Hi.

617
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,591
How nice to see you.
We'll talk soon.

618
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:00,875
You know, how healthy is it really,
for the soul, in a healthy body?

619
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,674
If you see what I mean...

620
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:07,111
Long time, no see.
Say hi to the missus.

621
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,197
Freddy...

622
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:14,872
That guy who Laila hooked up with...
what kind of guy was he?

623
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:20,074
- I don't know. I took a photo of him.
- Let me see.

624
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:22,510
There.

625
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:26,633
This is her brother!
You're just the best!

626
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:30,150
- I am?
- Yes, you.

627
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:34,353
- I'm going to be faithful forever!
- Congratulations.

628
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,950
Well, I'm not...

629
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,474
Edgar, my phone!

630
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,391
Excuse me.
You're that lady from TV.

631
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:54,878
I was wondering...
where can I play this?

632
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:59,710
I think I saw a video player
and a TV in here.

633
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:07,997
Just looking at the label, Edgar.

634
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:13,877
If Freddy hadn't come,
we'd be one letter short again.

635
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:18,073
- And that would be no good.
- But you've got room for two letters.

636
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:23,269
- It's not working.
- Let me take a look.

637
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:27,109
Let's see...
Who hooked up this?

638
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,351
Edgar...

639
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:45,035
Hey, Edgar.
So you can afford this...

640
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,196
Hello, Øyvind.

641
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,234
When you see this, I'll be dead,
but I'm sure you're aware of that.

642
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:57,595
As you know, I trust no-one, so I've
recorded my last will on video.

643
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:02,351
But I have to trust lawyer Krogstad
to take care of this video, -

644
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:08,874
- so it doesn't end up with the dirty
porn movies you bought at Svinesund.

645
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:15,155
I bet you didn't think
that you'd get anything from me.

646
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,920
You won't, either.

647
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,157
But there was some money left
from your dad.

648
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,397
Always a gambler.

649
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:27,512
He did win some money
before he died.

650
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:32,874
But I didn't want that money
to destroy you.

651
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:37,835
But, I'm dead now, so you
might as well have it now.

652
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:42,716
Yes, I bet you want to know
how much it is. It's...

653
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,957
Let's see, it was...

654
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,477
Twelve million four hundred thousand.

655
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:11,070
Twelve million. That would just about
cover half of the EdGarage, Edgar.

656
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,352
Yeah, I would think so.

657
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:29,076
Now you can finally afford a Porsche
and still have ten million left.

658
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:36,590
- Wow. Hi.
- Hi.

659
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,270
- What do you think of the game, guys?
- Amateur football.

660
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:44,712
Sure, but we'll take them down
in the second half.

661
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:49,357
- Hey, Norway!
- Norway! Norway!

662
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:53,951
My God, Stig, the guys
don't even seem motivated.

663
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,875
Look! Germany's got cheerleaders.

664
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:02,231
Look, what we haven't got.

665
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,031
Hey, you guys with the letters!

666
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,834
Can you do me a favour?

667
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,638
Not bad.

668
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,909
- We can't just stand here.
- Let's do the dance Helge taught us.

669
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:56,079
- No, my leg hurts...
- Sure, let's do that!

670
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,469
Look at this, guys.
Look at the screen.

671
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,391
OK? Are we gonna go get them?

672
01:24:58,360 --> 01:25:00,112
Øyvind.

673
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:09,109
Anne!

674
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:36,918
Let's hope this ecstatic athmosphere
rubs off on the players.

675
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:41,193
And there's the second half
under way. It's now or never.

676
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:44,995
And Norway is in fact passing
the ball forwards.

677
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:51,278
Won the ball once again
in the midfield...

678
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,152
My God!

679
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:00,399
- Where did Petter go?
- I havn't got a clue.

680
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,838
Another chance for Norway...

681
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,350
This game has completely
turned around!

682
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:13,075
Surely that's a free kick!

683
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:17,034
Yes, it is.
And in an excellent position.

684
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:22,269
It's a goal...

685
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,710
It's a goal!

686
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,753
Norway has scored!

687
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,755
What did you say to Åge?

688
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:51,432
I told him to wait until the 87th minute
before putting in Super Ray.

689
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:55,076
He'll be so eager
that he'll run right in and score.

690
01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:00,798
Ten minutes left, and it looks as if
Hareide is putting in Raymond Kvisvik.

691
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:07,030
Strange, he's also trying to establish
contact with a member of the crowd.

692
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:14,239
Hareide changes his mind!
He always makes substitutions now.

693
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:16,271
NEW MESSAGE
FROM LAILA

694
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,553
Kvisvik is going in now. Three
minutes left, the score is 1-1.

695
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:34,478
Our seasoned player is on the pitch,
and he goes straight into offense...

696
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:37,513
In the crossbar!

697
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:40,109
Øyvind!

698
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,993
Look!

699
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,636
Edgar!
I'm going to be a dad!

700
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:36,196
Here's Norway, five seconds left,
pass to Kvisvik, he shoots...

701
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,914
It's a goal!

702
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:48,439
The miracle of miracles!

703
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:53,156
Raymond Kvisvik
has lifted Norway sky-high!

704
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:05,269
We are World Champions!

705
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:40,193
THE KING CONGRATULATES
HEROES

706
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:42,630
KLAUS BITTMAN
TO FFK

707
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:44,876
ÅGE'S NEW ADVISOR

708
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,071
A PILGRIM'S RETURN

709
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,236
FFK CUP CHAMPIONS

710
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,675
7 MONTHS LATER

711
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,150
Hello...

712
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:23,672
Yes, we are all here to celebrate
the new sign, "Bergh & EdGarage".

713
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:31,318
- The sign says "EdGarage & Bergh".
- It should be "Bergh & EdGarage".

714
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:36,355
- No, Edgar founded the garage.
- But you saved the garage.

715
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:41,429
- This is a gesture from me to you...
- Your contribution saved all of us.

716
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:45,474
- You founded this garage...
- You have to go first, it's your money.

717
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:48,240
He saved all of ourjobs!

718
01:30:48,440 --> 01:30:52,149
The sign says "EdGarage & Bergh",
and the sign stays.

719
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,828
He has invested his capital...

720
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:59,238
- Maybe you should change his diaper?
- No, he needs to burp first.

721
