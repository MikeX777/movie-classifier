I am sorry
I’m a little late.

I was about to go inside.

There’s a storm coming,
and my hip’s killing me.

I’m sorry
to hear that, sir.

I’m gonna sit around all d

No, sir.

Be careful with
that top step there.

23
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:06,362
It gives a little.

183
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,552

184
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,553
Mwah.

185
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,005
I love you. I’ll see you
in the morning.

186
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,057

Hello, gals.

192
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,442
Well, looky here!

194
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,445
Hey, girl.
Hi.

195
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,447
Glad to
have you back.

196
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,450
Ha-ha-ha! Sure is
an improvement
over some folk.

197
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,452
Ha. That’s funny.
Just what I was thinking.

198
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,455
e.
Well, I can see things
haven’t changed around her

199
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,957
How’s Tyler?

200
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,792
He’s good. Yeah.

201
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:41,293
You know, as good as
a little boy can be

202
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,795
after having brain surgery

203
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,797
and 30 treatments
of radiation.

204
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,216
But he’s home.
For now. So...

205
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,218
So, what does
the doctor say?

206
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:52,605
The same. "Medulloblastoma
is a rare and aggressive
brain cancer.

207
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,106
"
Don’t get your hopes up.

208
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,058
Yeah, like I can
control that.

209
00:12:56,058 --> 00:12:58,110
But you know what?
The good news is,

210
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,613
my mom is staying
for a while until
things settle down.

211
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,531
Oh, that’s great.
Yeah.

212
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,950
Can you give me a report
on my patients, please?

213
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,452
Yeah, let me--

214
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,954
Okay, so, Mrs. Riley
is in 406.

215

That little boy Matthew
is in 402.

216

And Mr. Samuels
is back again in 410.

217

Mm-hm?

219
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,638
You sure you’re okay
with doing this?

220
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,922
Oh, piece of cake.

221
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:28,390
Your mom taught me
how to do it.

222
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,227
Um, are you sure you know
how to do this, Granna?

223
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,095
Cool it. You’re
making me nervous.

an air bubble in my heart.

00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,158
Yes, sir.

229
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:52,698
Tyler? What’s wrong?

230
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,200
Tyler, Mom wants
to talk to you.

I’m sorry, Granna.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

239

Maddy?

Mom, is Tyler okay?

Everything--
Everything’s fine.

243
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,888
Everything’s okay.

244
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,306
You don’t have
to come home.

245
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:19,308
Mom, everything’s
fine here.

246
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:20,309
Just stay at work.

247

Hey. Is he okay?

254
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:47,920
Yeah, he’s okay.

255
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,423
Are you okay?

256
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,426
No. This whole thing
stinks.

You know, when I’m
struggling with something,

260
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,937
it really helps me
to pray about it.

261
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,438
[Scoffs]
Pray? Yeah.

262
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,525
What are we supposed
to pray for, exactly?

263
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:11,527
Dear God...

264
00:15:11,527 --> 00:15:13,529
don’t take Tyler.

265
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:15,531
You have Dad.

266
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:16,865
Isn’t that enough?

267
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,001
Oh, Ben.

268
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:20,786
Prayer is just
telling God

269
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,288
what’s in your heart

270
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,789
and asking Him
to help you with it.

271
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,791
Well, maybe I don’t want
to tell God

272
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,793
what’s in my heart.

273
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,598
I’m afraid to ask God
to help Tyler.

274
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,850
I mean,
what if He doesn’t?

No, I can’t.

come over till later.

359
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,535
I figured
this was later.

360
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:54,953
Are you better?

361
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,422
I’m working on it.

362
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,424
Let me look at you.

363
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,794
Hmm. You don’t
look so bad.

364
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,181
I’m much better.

365
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,183
I think I’m going
back to school even.

366
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,685
Oh! Thank goodness.

367
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,553
If I have to eat lunch
one more day

368
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:13,055
with Ashley Turner,

369
00:21:13,055 --> 00:21:15,057
I’ll just die!
I mean, it’s horrible.

370
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:16,525
She--She smells
like liverwurst.

371
00:21:16,892 --> 00:21:18,477
Ugh!

372
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,813
[Sighs] Well, here.
I got you this.

373
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,700
Sweet! Thanks.

374
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:28,070
MADDY: Ben, get up!

375
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,072
Quick!
My mom’s coming.

376
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:36,578
Hey, Tybo,
you’re awake.

377
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,997
Yep, I’m awake.

378
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,333
Just sitting here...
being awake.

379
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,802
Oh. Is that a new hat?

380
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,305
You mean this thing?
Mm-hm.

381
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,674
Mom. So, uh--

382
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,893
So, I’m going back to
school today. Right?

383

[Sighs]

384
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,397
You think
you’re up to it?

385
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,349
I think so.
I don’t know.

386
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,817
What do you think, Sam?

387
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,268
[Laughs]

388
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:02,187
I think he’s ready.

389
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,573
Way to be
stealth, Sam!

390
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,574
[Laughs]
Hi, Miss Maddy.

391
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,075
Hi, sweetheart.
How are you?

392
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,578
I’m fine. My grandpa
told me Tyler was back.

393
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,079
Hmm. How is
your grandpa?

394
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,581
He’s good.
Good.

395
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,082
And grumpy.
[Laughs]

396
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,584
Okay. Good
and grumpy, then.

[Laughs]

398
00:22:17,619 --> 00:22:18,704
Well, I guess if you’re
going to school,

399
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,038
you ought to start
getting ready.

400
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:21,373
Yes!
Yes!

401
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,876
Ah-ah-ah!
Front door, please.

402
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:25,877
Sure, Miss Maddy.

403
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,346
Thank you, young lady.

404
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,264
See you on the bus, Ty.

405
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,682
,
Oh, no. You know what?
I’ve got to check him in

406
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:32,551
so he’ll
see you there later.

407
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,052
Scoot!

408
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,692
Oh, come on.
A walking route?

409
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,195
Yes. You know, one foot
in front of the other,

410
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,696
point A to point B,

411
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,198
deliver the mail
in between.

412
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,699
If it’s all the same
to you,

413
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,201
I’d rather just keep
working the line.

414
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,702
I can’t do
a walking route.

415
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,704
Oh, you can
and you will.

416
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,207
Uh, here’s the keys.

417
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,710
The truck is in 27 outside,
loaded and ready.

418
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,212
.
Here’s your line of travel

419
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,714
Heh. Follow the mail,
and you can’t get lost.

420
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,717
Nancy’s got
your uniform out back.

421
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,220
You’re already
two hours behind,

422
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,222
so I’d step on it.

424
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:20,098

425
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,602
You ready?

426
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:26,104
Mom?
Mm-hm?

427
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:27,606
Do you think
the kids at school

428
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:30,609
will make fun of me?

429
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,077
Some will.

430
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,113
Only because they don’t
know what else to say.

431
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:37,115
Hmm.

432
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:40,619
What should I do
if they do?

433
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,121
Wait. I know.

434
00:23:43,121 --> 00:23:45,123
I’ll do what
Jesus would do.

435
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,627
You don’t have to go,
you know.

436
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,629
No. I have to go.

437
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:53,131
Sam needs me.

I am so proud
of you.

have a great day.

Good dog.

Alex?

Can I catch
his disease?

464

You know, if he spits
on me or something?

465
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,811
No, you knucklehead.

466
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,763
He has cancer,

Samantha, we don’t
call people names.

No, Alex, cancer
is not contagious.

And Tyler’s been
through a lot.

470

He’s missed over
two months of school.

He’s probably gonna be
a little scared at first,

472
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,828
so let’s all welcome
him back to class

474
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,782

Whatever.

your notebooks,

to see Tyler.
Oh, thank you.

I should look out for?

Um, no.

00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,032
Oh, you know what?
He might get tired.

If he does,
just call me.

and pick him up.

Okay. I’ll keep
an eye on him.
Thank you.

Oh, oh,
you know what?

00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,624
He still has a central
medicine line,

496
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,126
so just make sure
he doesn’t get
submerged in water.

Sorry, that’s silly.

make you feel?

They do that for a while.

and then I’m done.

call you "Baldy"?

that funny hat?

Nah. But they made me
lay real still,

for five minutes a day,

at my head and my back.

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,344
"my first day back at school
was very exciting.

537
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:52,764
"I forgot to tell Sam
to do what Jesus would do.

538
00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:55,266
"We all ended up
in the principal’s office

539
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,268
to sort things out."

540
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,160
"My mom came
for me and Sam.

541
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,529
"I’m not sure who she was more worried about.

542
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:11,249
"On the way home,
Mom tried to be very firm.

543
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,251
"But when Sam told her
how mashed potatoes

544
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,619
,
"were stuck up Alex’s nose

545
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:17,455
"she laughed and laughed.

546
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,792
"Now I know
You’re getting my letters.

547
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,844
"Because only You could
figure out a way

548
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,846
to make her laugh."

549
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:32,137
"We got home just when
the mailman was at her house.

550
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,139
"I guess all the excitement
got to me,

551
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,640
because I threw up
on his shoes."

552
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:41,729
"My mom
couldn’t believe it.

553
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:43,731
All she could do
was laugh."

554
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:48,236
"All in all, God,

555
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:50,738
it was a very good day."

556
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,214
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

557
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,216
How was--
How was my day?

558
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,717
Well, uh, let’s see.

559
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,220
I almost got eaten
by a horse,

560
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,722
and some old man tried
to chase me off his porch

561
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,724
with a cane.

562
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,726
Oh, and then a kid
barfed on my shoes.

563
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,728
That’s what smells.

564
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,731
Boss, we’ve already had
four complaints in one day,

565
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,234
which is very good.
Might be a Post Office record.

566
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,236
Four is not so bad.

567
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,238
Oh, and one
possible lawsuit.

568
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,241
Do you know a guy
by the name of
Cornelius Perryfield?

569
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:30,245
God.

570
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,663
Letters to God.

571
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,082
These are from the kid
who threw up on my shoes.

572
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,583
What am I supposed
to do with these?

573
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,086
It’s your journey,
Brady. You decide.

574
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,587
[Mouths]

575
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,089
You know, if you’d
been here on time,

576
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,091
there would’ve been
a dead letter bin
about right here.

577
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,593
But since it’s
well after 6:00,

578
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,595
they’ve moved that bin
over to the warehouse.

579
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,597
So, you might want to just
gather your little letters

580
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,599
and walk ‘em over.

581
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,103
Thank you so much.

582
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,389
[Clicks tongue]

583
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,226
Ready!

584
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,698
Ready, Jack. Ready.

585
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,700
Isn’t that what you say-
- ready or steady?

586
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,201
Well, I’m ready.

587
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,703
Ah, I think you’ve
had enough.

588
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,206
[Chuckles]

589
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,709
All right.

590
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,128
I’ll just take
my business elsewhere.

591
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:22,580
You are a royal pain
anyway.

592
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,583
Brady.

593
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,585
Brady.

594
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:30,088
Give me your keys,
I’ll pour you one more.

595
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,560
I don’t see you taking
anyone else’s keys
around here.

596
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,062
I don’t see anybody else
staggering around.

597
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,564
You can stay
or you can go,

598
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,566
.
but either way,
I’m gonna take your keys

599
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,860
Hold these for a minute.

600
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,414
What are these?

601
00:31:56,698 --> 00:31:58,583
Uh...

602
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,335
some kid on my route.

603
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,337
I don’t know what to do.

604
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,839
How are you gonna
deliver these, man?

605
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,345
Doesn’t seem right
to shred ‘em.

606
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,846
I don’t know.

607
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,848
Letters to God?

608
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:17,852
Maybe you should
take ‘em to church
with you on Sunday.

609
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,688
Yeah. Yeah, that’s--

610
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,690
that’s what I’ll do.

611
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,724
MAN: Can I help you?

612
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,143
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

613
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,062
A little warning next time.

614
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,900
Sir. Mr. Reverend.
I mean--

615
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,902
No. Please,
call me Andy.

616
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,904
Andy, sure.

617
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,405
And you are?

618
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,408
Uh, Brady.

619
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,861
And I was just
dropping those off.

620
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:42,413
I wasn’t stealing
anything, I swear.

621
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,418
I’m sorry. That’s a bad
choice of words.

622
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,921
I just--
I just came in...

623
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,924
.
just because--
it’s just that I think..

624
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,927
this sick kid
on my route

625
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,929
is writing these--

626
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,933
these letters to...God.

627
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:06,721
And I thought you could
at least read them,

628
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:10,775
and send him, uh,
a gift basket or something.

629
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:13,144
That’s very kind of you,
going out of your way

630
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:16,397
to make sure that Tyler’
s letters are protected.

631
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:17,398
You know him?

632
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:20,401
Oh, yes. Yeah,
we love that family.

633
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,403
They’ve been members
here for...

634
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:23,821
quite a while.

635
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,241
With all that’s
happened, it’s been...

636
00:35:27,241 --> 00:35:29,744
difficult for them.

637
00:35:29,744 --> 00:35:33,247
But we certainly
keep them in our prayers

638
00:35:33,748 --> 00:35:35,750
and check on them often.

639
00:35:39,754 --> 00:35:43,057
You know, it seems to me

640
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,560
that God put these
letters in your hands

641
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,562
for a reason.

642
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,515
So, maybe you should
hold on to them.

643
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,066
No, I wouldn’t--

644
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,569
I don’t know what
to do with them. I, uh--

645
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,571
Well, first thing
you’re gonna do

646
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,073
is go home
and sleep it off.

647
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:01,025
And then...

648
00:36:01,442 --> 00:36:03,528
listen to God.

649
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,949
Let God tell you
what to do with them.

650
00:36:08,282 --> 00:36:10,368
After all, they are
written to Him.

651
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,874
And you know you’re
always welcome here.

652
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:19,377
This is a great place
to find answers.

653
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,881
Hey, can I, uh--

654
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,383
can I pray for you?

655
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,885
No, no. Really, I’m good
. That’s not necessary.

656
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,887
It’s, uh--
It’s what I do.

657
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,727
Thank You, Lord,
for Brady.

658
00:36:36,978 --> 00:36:39,564
Thank You for
making him caretaker

659
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,066
of these letters,

660
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,568
and for his heart.

661
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,124
Your plans
are always good.

662
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:53,127
Lord, I believe
You have a plan

663
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,130
and a purpose in this.

664
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,132
Help Brady
discover that plan,

665
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:02,220
because, Lord,
I know you’re about
to do something...

666
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,222
wonderful.

667
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:06,224
Something
more wonderful

668
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,226
than we can
possibly imagine.

669
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,730
In Jesus’ name
I pray.

670
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,734
Amen.
Hmm.

671
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,738
Well, sir,
how does it feel

672
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,740
to be on a mission
for God?

673
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,744
[Chuckles]

674
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,746
Heh-heh.

675
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,250
Perfect.

676
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,528
Shouldn’t you be
in school?

677
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:04,031
No. My mom
thought I should
take it easy today.

678
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,033
Is your mom home?

679
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,402
No. At work.
Oh.

680
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,788
But my Granna’s here.

681
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,740
Granna!

682
00:38:14,241 --> 00:38:15,743
[Sighs]

683
00:38:15,743 --> 00:38:18,245
I’m sorry about
your shoes yesterday.

684
00:38:18,245 --> 00:38:19,246
Ah, it’s all right.

685
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:21,248
Cujo down the street
pretty much ruined them

686
00:38:21,248 --> 00:38:22,667
before you
got to them, so...

687
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,585
You mean Rooster?

688
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:26,587
Oh, he’s a big
teddy bear.

689
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:28,589
You just gotta know
what he likes.

690
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,592
Rooster?
Rooster, the dog.

691
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:33,511
What is it, honey?

692
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,062
Oh, hello.

693
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,597
Brady McDaniels.

694
00:38:36,597 --> 00:38:38,599
I’m filling in
for Mr. Finley.
Oh, yes.

695
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:42,153
And, uh, this is from
down the street. Uh...

696
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,155
[Laughs]
That would be Linda Baker.

697
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,657
She’s such a dear.
Eight months pregnant,

698
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,659
and her soldier
husband’s away,

699
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,444
and still she’s thinking
about other people.

700
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,247
Honey, it’s time for you
to come in now.

701
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,749
Can I wait for Sam?

702
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:57,034
She’s gonna be home
from school any minute.

703
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,337
.
Well, all right,
but just don’t overdo it

704
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,838
Nice to meet you,
young man.

705
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,840
Likewise.

706
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,841
Uh...

707
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,343
[Bus approaches]

708
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,345
Here you go.
Oh.

709
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,846
Here you go.

710
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:13,017
Excuse me!

711
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,518
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where’s the fire?

712
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,637
Tell me everything.

713
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:19,140
Okay. So, Alex and I
had to write 500 times,

714
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,641
"I will not fight."

715
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:22,643
But Alex had to write
another 500 times,

716
00:39:22,643 --> 00:39:24,145
"I will not make fun
of people."

717
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:26,147
[Both laugh]

718
00:39:26,147 --> 00:39:28,649
People are always
gonna make fun of me.

719
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:33,654
Come on. I think I know
something that could help.

720
00:39:33,654 --> 00:39:35,156
Okay.

721
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,881
Every day?

722
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,717
You’ve got to drink
that stuff every day?

723
00:39:47,001 --> 00:39:48,586
Barf!

724
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,089
Barf yourself,
Mr. Doherty.

725
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:55,092
The doctor says
drink it, I drink it.

726
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,094
Like it or not.

727
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,432
[Whispering]
That explains it.

728
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,434
Explains what?

729
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:04,902
I’d be grouchy, too...

730
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:08,355
if I had to drink that.

731
00:40:08,355 --> 00:40:12,359
Grandpa,
we need your help.

732
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,162
Can’t. I’m busy.

733
00:40:15,362 --> 00:40:17,948
Grandpa, please?

734
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:20,367
It’s big-time.

735
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,538
Hmm. Okay.
Make it quick.

736
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:34,131
So, you say they’re
picking on you at school.

737
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:37,635
Well, one kid, really.
Alex.

738
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,136
Oh.

739
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,138
Don’t let it
bother you.

740
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,140
They’re jealous,
that’s all.

741
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:44,558
Jealous?

742
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,444
Because all my hair
fell out?

743
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,779
And my eyebrows
are almost gone?

744
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,115
No.

745
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,618
They’re jealous because
you’ve been chosen

746
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:58,122
for the role
of your lifetime.

747
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,958
You’ve been
handpicked by God.

748
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,795
You don’t believe me?

749
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:10,301
Well, maybe we’d better
ask Baron Dedushka.

750
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,719
Dedushka?

751
00:41:12,086 --> 00:41:14,171
Are you in there?

752
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,057
Dedushka?

753
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,345
Dedushka!

754
00:41:21,595 --> 00:41:25,900
!
Good news, Dedushka--he’s here

755
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,902
Ooh-la-la!

756
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,236
Ooh-la-la!
Ooh-la-la-la!

757
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,571
[Both laughing]

758
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,574
Ooh-la-la! Ooh-la-la!
Ooh-la--

759
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,075
[Laughing]

760
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,077
You’re him!

761
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,331
You must be
the famous Tyler.

762
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:42,082
Why am I
the famous one?

763
00:41:42,449 --> 00:41:44,535
Because God has chosen you--

764
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:48,038
the strongest, the wisest,
the smartest--

765
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:50,007
to receive the honor.

766
00:41:50,457 --> 00:41:53,844
Honor? Like a gold star
at school, Mr. Perryfield?

767
00:41:54,044 --> 00:41:57,131
No, not Perryfield.
Dedushka.

768
00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:59,633
And Dedushka mean
not that kind of honor.

769
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:03,103
.
The honor of being chosen
as one of God’s warriors

770
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,556
Wow!

771
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,391
I want to be a warrior.

772
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:09,727
Oh, well...

773
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,730
Samantha, I talked
to the principal.

774
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,732
He said you need
a little less warrior

775
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:17,618
and a little more...
peacemaker.

776
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,487
Samantha
the peacemaker.

777
00:42:22,489 --> 00:42:23,991
It doesn’t sound
as good as warrior,

778
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:25,492
but I’ll give it
a try.

779
00:42:25,492 --> 00:42:27,995
PERRYFIELD: Okay, good.
Now, where was I?

780
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:29,797
I’m a warrior.

781
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,632
Ah, yes,
you are God’s warrior,

782
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:34,134
which means you can
ride forth victoriously

783
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,504
in truth, humility,
and righteousness.

784
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:41,892
Dedushka is honored
to know you.

785
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,813
Now, come here, Tyler.

786
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,818
Tyler, come here.

787
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,822
Even though you’re sick,

788
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,275
when people see how
strong and brave you are,

789
00:42:58,692 --> 00:43:02,279
why, it makes them take
a look at their own lives.

790
00:43:02,696 --> 00:43:05,282
And so, maybe that’s
why they make fun of you

791
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:07,284
like Alex.

792
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,253
But, Tyler, there is
a glorious truth.

793
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,672
God is truth.

794
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,507
And it’s your job,
Tyler,

795
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,843
to point them
toward Him.

796
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,294
And if they
turn to Him,

797
00:43:17,711 --> 00:43:20,297
they find the truth.

798
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:24,301
Wouldn’t that be
a wonderful victory?

799
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:30,107
Tyler,
do you understand?

800
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,610
I think so.

801
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,112
Grandpa...

802
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,114
I don’t.

803
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,115
Ah.

804
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,236
I don’t feel so brave
because of...

805
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:45,205
PERRYFIELD: Ah.

806
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:48,158
[Sighs]

807
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,164
I have an idea.

808
00:44:05,092 --> 00:44:07,094
SAM: Grandpa, can I see?

809
00:44:07,094 --> 00:44:09,096
Samantha, be still.

810
00:44:09,096 --> 00:44:12,349
Now, you hold still.
We’re almost done.

811
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,234
All right.

812
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,240
SAM: Grandpa,
can I see?

813
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,526
Samantha, be patient.

814
00:44:23,777 --> 00:44:26,163
How do you feel?
They feel great.

815
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:29,166
Good. Now raise them up.
Right.

816
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,668
Now your right one.

817
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,671
[Laughing]
Your left one.

818
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,039
Finished!

819
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,423
We’re done.

820
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,925
Yes!
All right!

821
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,927
Just a moment.

822
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,762
Fantastic!

823
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:44,598
How are they?

824
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,100
They’re awesome!

825
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,601
They’re fantastic!

826
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,603
They’re awesomely
fantastic.

827
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,888
[Laughs]

828
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:52,139
I want to see!
I want to see!

829
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:53,640
Here you go.

830
00:44:56,143 --> 00:44:57,644
Cool.

831
00:44:57,644 --> 00:45:00,147
Awesome.
[Laughs]

832
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:01,148
All right.

833
00:45:01,648 --> 00:45:03,650
Now, will you
get out of here?

834
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,652
Dedushka is tired.

835
00:45:05,652 --> 00:45:07,654
Thanks, Grandpa.
All right.

836
00:45:07,654 --> 00:45:09,156
Ohh.

837
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,880
Oh, you’re home early.
Yep.

838
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,882
Made your favorite.

839
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,384
That’s Ty’s favorite.

840
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,386
Oh.

841
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,887
Well, now,
don’t tell me.

842
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,389
Don’t tell me.
Let me guess.

843
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,391
Yours is...
carrot cake.

844
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,892
Mm-mm.

845
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,894
Uh, marble?
Nope.

846
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,396
Black Forest.
No.

847
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,647
Oh, gosh.

848
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:35,432
Premature senility.

849
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,317
I’ve always been
afraid of it.

850
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,820
It’s okay. Forget it.
It’s all good.

851
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,321
Ah-ah-ah-ah.
Come here.

852
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,824
Sit down. Stir.

853
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,332
Why don’t you tell me
what’s on your mind?

854
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,335
Nothing.

855
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,340
Everything.

856
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,843
Well, that about
covers it.

857
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,845
I just feel weird,
you know?

858
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,847
About Ty and what
he’s going through.

859
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,349
All the attention
he gets.

860
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:13,187
I mean, I know that sounds
totally stupid and selfish.

861
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:17,057
I just hate
that he’s sick.

862
00:46:17,558 --> 00:46:21,361
Oh, sweetheart, we all
hate that he’s sick.

863
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,363
Sometimes I think
it’s worse for us

864
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,365
than it is for him.

865
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,201
So go easy on yourself.

866
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,036
I just want normal,
Granna.

867
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,537
I mean, do you know
how many times

868
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,040
I’ve asked for Mom just 
to take me to get my license?

869
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,041
No.

870
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,492
Well, you can’t count
that high.

871
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,544
Oh, Ben.

872
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,546
We can’t do anything
because we don’t
have any money

873
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,915
and Tyler’s always sick
or he’s in the hospital.

874
00:46:42,249 --> 00:46:44,835
Well, shall we accept
good from God

875
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:45,836
and not trouble?

876
00:46:46,253 --> 00:46:48,839
.
It just seems like
all we’re getting is trouble

877
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,842
MADDY: Hey. Ben, did you
take the trash to the curb?

878
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:53,844
Honey, we were
talking here.

879
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,345
Well, that’s not
gonna get the trash
to the curb.

880
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:56,847
Talking doesn’t even
matter to her anymore.

881
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,348
All she does
is bark orders.

882
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,350
Ben, don’t talk to me
like that.

883
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,352
Okay, then, fine. I’ll jus
t stop talking altogether.

884
00:47:02,352 --> 00:47:03,854
Because I’m practically
invisible anyways.

885
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,355
Benjamin!

886
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,857
I’m sick of all this.
I just wish--

887
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,192
It’s all about Tyler.

888
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,077
Benjamin,
I am warning you--

889
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,745
All of our time,
all of our money,
everything.

890
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:14,248
I just--
I just hate him!

891
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,532
[Clatter]

892
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:17,918
Tyler, wait!

893
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,922
Maddy, let Ben
handle this, honey.

894
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,423
[Sighs]

895
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,425
Come over here
and sit down.

896
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,427
Ohh.
Come on, sweetheart.

897
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,430
I can’t do this.

898
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,933
Oh, sweetie.
Yes, you can.

899
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,385
[Sighs]
He didn’t mean it.

900
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,356
Were those eyebrows?

901
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,358
[Laughs]
Yes! They were.

902
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,310
[Both laughing]

903
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,322
Go away, or I’ll jump.

904
00:47:55,322 --> 00:47:57,824
[Sighs]
No, you won’t.

905
00:47:57,824 --> 00:48:00,327
How do you know?

906
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:02,329
Well, because
it took me a week

907
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:04,331
to get you out here
in the first place.

908
00:48:09,336 --> 00:48:10,837
Come on, sit.

909
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:24,434
Look...

910
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:26,436
I just wanted to say
that I’m sorry

911
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:28,438
and that I didn’t mean
any of those things

912
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,440
that I said back there.

913
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,947
What do you see
when you look at me?

914
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,949
Ty, don’t be like that.

915
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:39,950
I’m serious.

916
00:48:40,367 --> 00:48:43,453
I know you’re mad at me
because I’m sick.

917
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:46,456
Ty, I’m not mad at you
because you’re sick.

918
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:48,342
And I don’t hate you.

919
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,761
I guess I just miss you.

920
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,764
I miss all
the fun times we had,

921
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,266
and I guess I’m just
afraid that--

922
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,770
that we might not have
any of those ever again.

923
00:49:12,316 --> 00:49:13,700
You’re such a dweeb.

924
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,535
You’re such a toad.

925
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,037
[Chuckles]

926
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,406
I want you to write
a letter to God.

927
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,792
I want you to tell Him
how you feel.

928
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,294
I’m sure that He can
help you and Mom.

929
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,799
Not to sound mean, but...

930
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,218
Ty, that’s really lame.

931
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:33,086
It’s not lame.

932
00:49:33,086 --> 00:49:35,589
It’s my favorite way
to talk to God.

933
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:38,558
It’s like texting
your best friend.

934
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,511
You’re right.

935
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:43,513
Okay.
All right.

936
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,515
Okay.

937
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,017
[Sighs]

938
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,354
Here’s your pad.

939
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,239
All right.

940
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,243
I’m a warrior, you know.

941
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,195
Heh. A warrior, huh?

942
00:49:58,612 --> 00:50:00,697
Well, I think
you’re gonna have to be,
with those eyebrows.

943
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:04,034
[Laughs]

944
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,426
[Sighs] So, uh...

945
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,927
is Sam your girlfriend?

946
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,430
Yuck! No way!

947
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,432
Okay. Sorry I asked.

948
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,934
Well, she’s my best--
like a boy--kind of friend.

949
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,937
Hmm, right.
Enough said.

950
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,441
You have any kids?

951
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:32,446
[Sighs]
I have a boy.

952
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:36,450
Uh...a little bit
younger than you.

953
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,952
He lives with his mom,
though, so I don’t--

954
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,954
I don’t see him much.

955
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,956
Oh. That’s too bad.

956
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,458
Yeah.

957
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:45,959
Well...

958
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,914
[Grunts]

959
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:54,918
Aw, cool.

960
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:56,920
Like that?
Yeah.

961
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,393
Nice.

962
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,815
Heh. Hey, maybe you can
show me that move.

963
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,271
Okay, come on.

964
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:19,443
Nice! Not bad.

965
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,663
So...are you on a team?

966
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,499
Yeah.

967
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,501
I haven’t played
since I got sick.

968
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:28,785
I want to, though.

969
00:51:29,035 --> 00:51:30,120
Yeah.

970
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:35,675
Hey. Buddy,
go wash up for dinner.

971
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,511
Okay.
Hi.

972
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:40,380
Thanks for the game.

973
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,884
You got it, tiger.
Hey! Be quick!

974
00:51:43,884 --> 00:51:44,885
Heh.

975
00:51:45,385 --> 00:51:46,386
Uh, Brady.

976
00:51:46,386 --> 00:51:47,888
I’m Madelyn Doherty.

977
00:51:47,888 --> 00:51:49,890
But everyone
calls me Maddy.

978
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,947
Anyway, it’s, uh--

979
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,448
it’s not serious, is it?

980
00:51:58,448 --> 00:51:59,950
I mean, he’s gonna
be okay, right?

981
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,402
We hope so.

982
00:52:02,402 --> 00:52:04,404
Good.
Yeah.

983
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,625
He’s a good kid.
Thank you.

984
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,216
Um, Brady?

985
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,667
Your...bag.

986
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:19,719
Oh. Heh! Okay.

987
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,721
Gonna need that.
Yeah.

988
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,590
Whoops.

989
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,893
Um, my--my mail?

990
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,311
Oh. Right.

991
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,313
Yes. Uh...

992
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,100
Here. Sorry.
[Laughs]

993
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:35,902
It’s mostly bills
anyway.

994
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,404
Yeah. "Urgent".

995
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,406
[Telephone rings]
Oh. More bills.

996
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,357
[Laughs]

997
00:52:40,774 --> 00:52:42,325
[Ring]

998
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:43,860
Um, hey, listen,

999
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:47,364
thank you for taking
some time with Tyler.

1000
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:49,866
I really
appreciate that.

1001
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,868
BEN: Mom! Phone!

1002
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,203
I’m coming!

1003
00:52:53,453 --> 00:52:55,038
Okay. We’ll see you.

1004
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:56,540
Bye-bye.
Bye.

1005
00:53:08,468 --> 00:53:10,053
Whew!

1006
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:11,555
Hey, buddy.
Hi, Mom.

1007
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:13,056
Whatcha doin’?

1008
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,058
I’m writing
a letter to Alex.

1009
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,561
Alex? From school?

1010
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:19,062
Yeah.

1011
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:20,897
Hmm.

1012
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,700
You see, I just
want him to know

1013
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,702
that I’m not mad
at him,

1014
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,038
and that I can
understand why
he makes fun of me.

1015
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:33,293
Mr. Perryfield said
that I’m God’s warrior,

1016
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,745
and that I can make him
feel things that...

1017
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,215
he doesn’t want to feel.

1018
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,583
But that’s good.

1019
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:41,418
Because maybe...

1020
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,720
he’ll turn to God
for the answers.

1021
00:53:47,507 --> 00:53:50,510
Well, Mr. Perryfield
is a very smart man.

1022
00:53:52,512 --> 00:53:54,981
So...what’s up?

1023
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,984
Well, sweetheart...

1024
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:02,989
um, it’s time to go back
and finish your medicine.

1025
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,196
Really?

1026
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:12,198
Yeah, really.

1027
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,039
Okay.

1028
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:20,874
Okay.

1029
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:23,903
[Sighs]

1030
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,405
Ohh.

1031
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,409
POLICE RADIO:
Roger. Unit 72 responding.

1032
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,194
D.U.I. suspect.

1033
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:33,580
We have a minor boy
in the back seat.

1034
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,949
D.U.I. suspect
being booked.
