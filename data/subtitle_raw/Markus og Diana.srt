1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,510
What are you doing, Mousy?

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,757
I'm just walking around
the lamp post.

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,272
- Around the lamp post?
- Yes, so as not to break my leg.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,632
- That's no good.
- How do you know?

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,434
I don't understand how anyone
can be that superstitious.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,350
- Don't you understand everything?
- Most things, but not you.

7
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,313
I'm not easy to understand.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,399
You shouldn't say you're afraid
to break your leg.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,115
Why not?
- Because that's when it happens.

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,233
Hardly anyone who breaks their leg
thinks about it in advance.

11
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,637
Those who don't think about it
break their legs.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,229
What are you frightened of?
- Wait.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,000
What if that bloke is colour blind?

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,670
He's probably learnt to drive
when he thinks it looks red.

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,190
But what if his vision
suddenly becomes normal again?

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,155
Then we're finished!
- We will be if you don't hurry up!

17
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,477
I'm trying to avoid
stepping on the stripes.

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,198
It's better not being run over.
- But the best is to avoid both.

19
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,278
It's dangerous
to be that scared, Mousy.

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,508
Do you have to call me Mousy?
- Everybody calls you Mousy.

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,075
But you could call me Markus.

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,874
I'm your friend, right?
- Yes...

23
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,315
That's why I call you Mousy.
Then you get used to it.

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,115
No, I don't.
- Just wait and see.

25
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,632
Mona is looking at you.
- No, she's looking at you.

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,358
That's just what I was afraid of.
- Just look back, then they'll stop.

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,473
That's easy for you to say.
- No, it was actually quite hard.

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,514
May we have your autograph?

29
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,272
That was Jostein Gaarder!
- I can see that.

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,713
Don't you want his autograph?
- Don't you?

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,832
I don't collect autographs.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,073
Hurry up.
- I don't want to.

33
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,589
Sometimes I wonder if you are
the world's biggest coward.

34
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,912
Dear Jostein Gaarder.

35
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,557
I'm an 84-year-old widow,
unfortunately, nearly blind, -

36
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,878
- so I can't read your books
myself, but my grandson, -

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,471
- little Markus Simonsen,
reads them to me.

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,313
I'm sitting here in my wheelchair,
blinded by tears, writing to you.

39
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,152
I used to prefer "Superman",
but now you're my favourite.

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,319
Little Markus
collects autographs, -

41
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,878
- so would you please
be so kind and send him yours?

42
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,358
That would make both
a young and an old heart...

43
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,712
...mighty joyful.

44
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,670
Is something wrong, Markus?

45
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,553
No...

46
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,312
It's so quiet here.

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,115
As if you were crying,
if you know what I mean.

48
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,869
No, everything is okay, daddy.

49
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,235
I just got a bit worried, after...

50
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,555
So everything is okay then?
- Yes.

51
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,838
Nothing is wrong?

52
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,349
No.

53
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,509
Well, it's time to go to bed then.

54
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,030
Tomorrow's the big day.

55
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,152
The big class trip
to the mountains.

56
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,239
I bet you're looking forward to it.

57
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,874
Yes, I'm sure it will be fun.

58
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,273
Are you going high up?
- Yes, I suppose so.

59
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,634
Above the tree line?
- Yes, quite a lot higher.

60
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,274
Poor those with acrophobia.
- Oh yes, poor them!

61
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,791
Maybe I should come and help carry?
- Some other time, daddy.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,356
We can go in the mountains
together some other time.

63
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,237
Just the two of us?
- Yes, all the way to the top.

64
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,310
Viggo, pull yourself together.

65
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,798
I don't know.
Leave the girls alone.

66
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,276
Is all the luggage loaded?

67
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,351
Stop running around.

68
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,677
Let's take a photo.

69
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,395
We're going to take a photo.

70
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,913
We need to have a little memory
for the parents.

71
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,795
Yes, that's good.

72
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,232
I'll help you with the rucksack.

73
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,433
I don't think that's very smart.
- No? I wanted to help...

74
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,679
I think you'd better leave now.

75
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,316
See you, dad.
- Yes, bye...

76
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,474
Have a nice trip.
- Thank you, Simonsen.

77
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,276
Be careful, my boy.
- Relax. We'll look after him.

78
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,749
World record in weightlifting!
- Calm down a bit now.

79
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,270
Are you moving
to the mountains, Mousy?

80
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,270
We'll take one more.
Markus, you decide now.

81
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,313
Markus, it's your turn.

82
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,834
A tiny mouse a tiny mouse
is never wanted in my house

83
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,679
Come on, Markus.

84
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,033
An autograph an autograph

85
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,879
that is a...

86
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,153
That's good, Markus.
What rhymes with autograph?

87
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,992
An autograph an autograph
that is a...

88
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,239
No, this is no good. What...
- Nothing, teacher.

89
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,319
Nothing rhymes with autograph.
- Well, never mind.

90
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,830
My phone is ringing.

91
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,192
Hello, this is KÃ¥re.

92
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,030
Yes, we're having a great time.

93
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,674
You heard it. That's good.

94
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,270
I'll tell him. That's all right.

95
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,712
That was Markus' daddy
wishing us a nice trip.

96
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,395
Let's sing another song.

97
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,630
Hurry up. Don't just stand there.
Come on!

98
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,679
Can you see that star?

99
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,715
Where?

100
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,115
There.

101
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,352
That's Sirius.

102
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,040
But what we see
isn't Sirius now.

103
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,749
The light has taken many years
to reach Earth.

104
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,032
What we see
is Sirius eight years ago.

105
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,038
My mum was alive then.

106
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,194
Dad won't sleep tonight.

107
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,154
Markus and Sigmund,
come on!

108
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,473
Who's the sexiest?

109
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,198
Sharon Stone has tits
like mountains.

110
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,712
Melanie Griffith is much nicer.
- I'd like her in the sack.

111
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,879
She's married to Don Johnson.
I wouldn't have him in the sack!

112
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,311
I think she's divorced now.
- They're all divorced.

113
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,637
They remarry, have a fuck
and get divorced again.

114
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,198
Diana Mortensen isn't married.
- No, Diana Mortensen is very choosy.

115
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,188
She's been with Michael Douglas.
- Everybody has been with him.

116
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,836
Not Melanie Griffith,
because she's with Don Johnson.

117
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,715
Paul Newman hasn't been divorced.
- Has he always been married?

118
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,515
What do you mean with always?
- All the time.

119
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,316
Since the Big Bang?
- What bang?

120
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,913
Ten points to Sharon Stone
and nine points to Diana Mortensen.

121
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,359
Sigmund, who is Diana Mortensen?

122
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,436
Don't you know?
- No.

123
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,317
She lives in Hollywood,
but comes from Horten.

124
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,956
She acts in
"Money and Power" on TV.

125
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,391
I have a photo of her.

126
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,151
Oh...

127
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,510
What are you doing?

128
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,598
Hey, Mousy!

129
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,912
Who's that guy
on the other side of the pool?

130
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,554
That's her bodyguard.

131
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,756
He tried to smash the camera,
but the photographer got away.

132
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,794
Diana Mortensen
has no private life.

133
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,475
Poor her.

134
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,478
Let's get into bed
and sleep now, boys.

135
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,316
Shush, I can't hear what he's saying.
What did you say, Reidar?

136
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,719
Julia Roberts gets three points.
- That's nice for her.

137
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,396
But let's sleep now.

138
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,198
Diana Mortensen... ten points.

139
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,990
What's happening here?
- Mousy is sleepwalking.

140
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,113
Shush! Don't wake him.
You can give him a shock.

141
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,274
Help, a ghost!
- Shush!

142
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,555
He's probably dreaming something.
- Dreams may be as real as reality.

143
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,231
You bet they can.

144
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,788
Come on now. Stay on the path.
It's not that far now.

145
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,473
Come on, Markus.

146
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,353
You're not superstitious,
are you, Mousy?

147
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,791
You're crossing as number 13.

148
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,790
Come on!
You can do it, Mousy.

149
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,833
Come on, Markus!

150
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,879
Has he gone bonkers or what?

151
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,193
Hey, Markus...

152
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,071
Mousy!

153
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,395
Mousy...

154
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,196
Forget about them, Mousy.
- Please don't call me Mousy!

155
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,675
Never again, Markus.

156
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,273
I ran up here all alone.
Did you see it?

157
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,031
Even though I have acrophobia!
- Don't look down.

158
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,479
Let's have a rest here. Relax.

159
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,755
Can we walk on the glacier?

160
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,077
We've walked far enough today.

161
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:06,277
But I can make a nature trail...
- They're for kindergartens.

162
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,473
Walking on glaciers is much cooler.
- And much more dangerous.

163
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,350
I've walked on glaciers.
- Have you, Markus?

164
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,078
That's really something.

165
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,999
You're lying!
- I'm not.

166
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,716
Me and my dad walk
on glaciers every summer.

167
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,559
That's great, Markus.

168
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,036
Maybe you can give us
a lecture about it?

169
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,390
A lecture?

170
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,956
Yes, about walking on glaciers.

171
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,158
When?

172
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,631
Here he comes!

173
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,915
Walking on glaciers
is like walking on ice.

174
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,474
When you walk on glaciers,
you need warm clothes...

175
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,072
...if the sun doesn't shine.
Then it's not so important.

176
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,556
What about wellingtons?

177
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,958
With spikes.
Wellingtons with spikes.

178
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:59,272
Last year when dad and I walked
on the glacier, it was very cold.

179
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,314
The wind was so bad
it was a hurricane.

180
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:12,074
Yes, a great big hurricane.
- A big hurricane!

181
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,792
Good advice...
- Was hard to come by!

182
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,833
The fog came...
- Where did the fog come?

183
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,828
It came... drifting.
- I knew it...

184
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,192
The ski tracks became covered
in snow. Should we turn around?

185
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,589
No, we didn't turn.
We just continued walking.

186
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,429
On the other side of the glacier
was the warm cottage.

187
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,519
We walked on. The glacier
was slippery like a skating rink.

188
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,474
We folded out our jackets
and slid joyfully along the glacier.

189
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,274
It was a fantastic experience!

190
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,870
We knew walking on a glacier
could be dangerous, -

191
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,756
and the most dangerous thing
is the cracks in the glacier.

192
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,910
They were our worst enemy.
And what did we see in the distance?

193
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,591
A crack in the glacier?
- Yes, a crack as deep as...

194
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,032
Really deep! Daddy and I
slid straight towards it.

195
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,038
The speed was incredible!

196
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,152
It was really incredible!

197
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,558
And then?

198
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,437
Then... Then we went home.

199
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,599
And afterwards we both agreed
it had been a nice trip.

200
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,115
That's me.

201
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,435
Yes, this is KÃ¥re. Oh, it's you.
One moment, and I'll ask.

202
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,315
Markus, it's your dad.
He wants to know how you are.

203
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,353
I'm fine...

204
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,233
So this is where you are.

205
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,719
Do you think dreaming
is the same as lying?

206
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,030
That depends on
what you're dreaming.

207
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,792
I dream
that everything is different.

208
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,310
That's not lying, that's hoping.

209
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,238
I wish I was there now.

210
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,998
Where?

211
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,193
On Sirius eight years ago.

212
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,473
Dear Diana Mortensen.

213
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,992
I'm a Norwegian mountain climber
and millionaire.

214
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,715
Here I am, all alone
in a cottage in the mountains, -

215
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,913
- after having climbed out of
a crack in the glacier, -

216
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,749
- which I was unfortunate enough
to have fallen in.

217
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,351
Many Norwegian mountain climbers
think about you, -

218
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,111
- feel sorry for you
and wish you all the best.

219
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,871
I have to tell you
that I have a special hobby:

220
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,640
I collect autographs.

221
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,678
It's an interesting hobby
for a lonely millionaire.

222
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,396
I'm unmarried. The mountains
and the business take all my time.

223
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,673
As you understand,
I'm a lonely millionaire.

224
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,955
Just like you're a lonely film
star. I can see it in your eyes.

225
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,311
But don't worry, Diana Mortensen.

226
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,355
One day we'll both
meet the right person.

227
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,916
Best regards
from the Norwegian mountains -

228
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,556
- and Markus Simonsen,
millionaire.

229
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,875
There's the mountain wanderer.

230
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,153
Did you have a nice trip?
- Yes.

231
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,478
Was there any snow up there?
- No, there was a glacier.

232
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,877
Glaciers are eerie things!

233
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,995
You didn't walk on it?
- No.

234
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,788
Do you know
what they call me at work?

235
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:37,192
They call me "The Owl".

236
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,590
I shouldn't have phoned, should I?
- It doesn't matter.

237
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,475
Did they tease you
because I phoned?

238
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,836
No, you phoned
because they tease me.

239
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,837
You have to go to bed now, Markus.

240
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,349
Markus...

241
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,640
A cheque for ten million dollars
for your daughter, Mr. Smith.

242
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,753
That should give life a chance.

243
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,234
I've brought your breakfast
and a letter.

244
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,035
Letter?
- Yes, from USA.

245
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,389
Do you know anyone
in America, Markus?

246
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,991
"Yes, I'm lonely.
Most people think I'm cold, -

247
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,193
but deep inside I'm still
the little girl with burning cheeks -

248
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,838
who left her friends
to conquer Hollywood and the world.

249
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,114
Yes, dear Markus Simonsen. I'm
Cinderella, but where is the prince?"

250
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,995
Has Diana Mortensen
written that to you?

251
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,351
She sent me a photo
with her autograph as well.

252
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,473
What did you write to her?
- That I was a millionaire.

253
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,196
Have you won the lottery?
- No, it's from...

254
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,677
Diana Mortensen.

255
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,838
Do you know Diana Mortensen?

256
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:54,149
He's just mocking you, Per Espen.
- Watch the cracks in the asphalt!

257
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,832
You watch the cracks in your brain.
They're much deeper!

258
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:05,068
Practicing psychology.
We never learn that at school.

259
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,678
What if he had taken the letter?

260
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,156
I would have punched him
in the face.

261
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,634
I swear...
- I swear...

262
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,559
To dedicate my life
to helping Diana Mortensen.

263
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,196
To dedicate my life
to helping Diana Mortensen.

264
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,119
And never let her down.
- And never let her down.

265
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,359
But to help, comfort and support her
in her deep loneliness.

266
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:50,113
But to help, comfort and support her
in her deep loneliness.

267
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,030
To respect, obey and never betray
the secret laws of the Diana Club.

268
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,997
To respect, obey and never betray
the secret laws of the Diana Club.

269
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,752
Help Diana!
- Help Diana!

270
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,795
Dear Diana.

271
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,470
I recognized my own feelings
in your letter.

272
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,471
I experienced a deep melancholy,
as well as pleasure.

273
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:35,198
A pleasure because you exist,
live and breathe.

274
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,915
Personally I appreciate
the little things in life.

275
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,557
I often get my inspiration
from nature.

276
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,915
A small cone
with its rugged beauty, -

277
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,399
- an evening sun which gilds
our hearts with its magic lustre.

278
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:03,238
Yes, dear Diana, this was a little
something about my inspiration.

279
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,992
With greetings from one heart
to another. Markus.

280
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,591
Hello, Mousy.
- Hi.

281
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,634
Do you want a punch in the face?
- No, thank you.

282
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,355
Oh, did you fall, Mousy?
- Straight down the glacier crack.

283
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,393
Who do you think you are?

284
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,797
What are you doing, boys?
- Nothing, teacher.

285
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,310
I'm just teaching them judo.

286
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,719
Do you know judo, Markus?
- Yes, I have a black belt.

287
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,158
Well, be careful then.

288
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,430
Yeah, that's just it.

289
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,554
We were just fooling around, Mousy.
- Yeah, just fooling around.

290
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,230
Do you want to come see the girls?
- See the girls?

291
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,750
They have PE.
Per Espen and I watch them change.

292
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,272
Lots of tits and thighs.
- You'll get dead horny.

293
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,393
I'm not interested in girls.
- Are you gay or what?

294
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,831
Gay?
- Maybe he's frightened he'll come.

295
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,919
When you're nearly coming,
then think of someone dead.

296
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,908
That's what I do.
- Per Espen gets really horny.

297
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,237
The girls don't want you
to come straight away.

298
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,910
I know that.
- Do you want to or not?

299
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,158
Look at Ellen Christine's tits.
- Look at that arse.

300
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,238
Move over, Per Espen.

301
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,157
I guess he came!

302
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,114
But listen, Sigmund!

303
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,474
She writes she's coming to Horten.
She wants to meet me.

304
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:33,195
She wants to drink champagne with me!
What shall I do?

305
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,313
Meet her, of course!
- But, Sigmund...

306
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,398
She thinks I'm a millionaire!

307
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,190
I've got it!

308
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:57,028
You have to pretend to be your son.
- I don't have a son.

309
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,676
No, but the millionaire
Markus Simonsen has one.

310
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,270
Markus Simonsen Junior.
- Junior?

311
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,553
Millionaire sons are called Junior.
- But I'm no millionaire son.

312
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,389
You have to pretend to be.
- But she wants to meet Senior!

313
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,354
But Junior is like his dad:
He understands and comforts her.

314
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,758
Why should I comfort her?
- She writes that she's lonely.

315
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,669
I don't want to.
- Are you a coward?

316
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,233
Do you want her to be alone
with her loneliness?

317
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:43,833
Everything for Diana, Markus.
- Yes, I know, but...

318
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,318
May we sit here?
- Yes, just sit down.

319
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,838
Where are you going?

320
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,396
"The little curlyhead is curious as
a squirrel and fast as a stoat, -

321
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,831
but also a thoughtful little thing.

322
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,350
I can talk to Markus Junior
about everything.

323
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,951
He's a comfort and pleasure
to his father during sad times.

324
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,597
Yes, dear Diana, this was
a little something about my son."

325
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,237
How did that sound?
- Where do you get it from?

326
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,115
Maybe we should drop "curlyhead"?
- Why? It sounds perfect.

327
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,869
Yes, but I don't have any curls!

328
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:01,714
Have you got any books about
behaviour and manners?

329
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,913
We want to learn
how to behave correctly.

330
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,955
Are you sure you don't prefer
something a bit more exciting?

331
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:16,359
Good behaviour can be exciting.
- Yes, that's right.

332
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,677
Not many kids your age
understand that.

333
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,908
No, we're a bit special.
- Yes, you can say that again.

334
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,480
Let me see.

335
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,034
"Behaviour and manners
in the nineties". How about that?

336
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,789
I'm sure that excellent, madam.

337
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:53,152
"Today, more than ever,
it's important to market yourself.

338
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,115
The first impression is crucial,
so look happy and friendly -

339
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,357
and repeat your name
so others remember it.

340
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,439
Either use a business card
or say it loud and clearly."

341
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,269
Lots to learn here.
- What do you mean?

342
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,076
How long is it since you
looked happy and friendly?

343
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,877
How often do you repeat your name?
- Everybody calls me Mousy anyway.

344
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,277
Yes, and here's the explanation.
- For what?

345
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,836
For why you're being teased.
You look so unhappy.

346
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,635
I thought
it was the other way round.

347
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,274
How?

348
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:37,871
That I was looking unhappy
because I was being teased.

349
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,318
"Rules for kissing on the cheek."
- I don't give a damn!

350
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,398
What if you don't know
how to kiss Diana?

351
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,513
I don't want to kiss her!
- All millionaire sons do so.

352
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,396
Which cheek do you kiss first?
- Isn't one enough?

353
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,310
"Watch how the royals do it.
First the right, then the left."

354
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,631
Do you understand?
- What are you two up to?

355
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,912
Nothing, we're just
marketing ourselves.

356
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,829
You have to kiss her!

357
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:27,999
"Today, more than ever, it's very
important to look happy and friendly.

358
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,713
Watch the royals..."

359
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,389
Markus, is that you?

360
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,229
I had a bad dream and...

361
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,557
I thought you were a murderer.

362
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,876
I dreamt too.

363
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,640
What did you dream?

364
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:41,914
You smiled very pleasantly.
- I dreamt I was being friendly.

365
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,677
How heavy is a tennis ball?
- It weighs at least 56.70 grams.

366
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,000
And how long is it?
- It's not long! It's round.

367
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,078
What's the diameter?

368
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,670
Why do I have to know all this?

369
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,789
Diana knows about tennis.
- I can't take anymore of this!

370
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,152
Come on, Markus.
You're really getting it now.

371
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,672
Mousy, do you play tennis?

372
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,558
I think she's following me.

373
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,518
Hi, Sigmund.

374
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,188
You want to play double?
- No!

375
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,039
No, we're finished.

376
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,076
But would you like
to have dinner with us?

377
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,478
Dinner? Where?
- At The Star restaurant.

378
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,109
When?
- Friday at 7 pm.

379
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,833
It will be a good dress rehearsal.
- For what?

380
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:11,032
Your meeting with Diana.

381
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,798
Has anything special
happened lately?

382
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,958
No, dad, what should that be?

383
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,754
Dad?
- Yes...

384
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,795
Does one have to wear gloves
to be correctly dressed today?

385
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,353
No, that isn't necessary
to be correctly dressed today.

386
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,749
Unless you want some nice accessories
for your spring suit.

387
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,793
Have a nice day, dad.

388
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,316
But, dad...
- Yes?

389
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,356
What does one do if one doesn't
want the guests to arrive in jeans?

390
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,353
Come on! Who leads the way to
the table? The man or the woman?

391
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:26,393
What?
- The man or the woman?

392
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,070
When the waiter shows you
to the table, -

393
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:36,196
the woman shall follow him,
and the man go after her.

394
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,712
Who shall sit where in a restaurant
if two seats are mounted on the wall?

395
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,311
You're burning me!
- With one chair across from them?

396
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,069
The woman shall have
the view of the room. Be careful!

397
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,637
We've invited guests to a restaurant.
What can we expect from the waiters?

398
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,230
A polite and in no way
condescending attention.

399
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,436
Get finished. Daddy's coming soon.
- I know. Let's receive him well.

400
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,909
Hello!

401
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,838
Hello...
Hi, Sigmund, are you here?

402
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,913
Good day, Mr. Simonsen. Did you
have a hard day at the office?

403
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:24,638
A bit. Where is Markus?
I brought a small...

404
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,114
Would you like a glass of water?

405
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,552
You look like
Little Lord Fauntleroy!

406
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,630
Maybe you're not thirsty?
- You look like a "snuffle"!

407
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:47,871
What's a "snuffle"?
- You... shut up!

408
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,595
You look like a...

409
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,433
Straighten out those curls,
you curly mouse!

410
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,272
Please don't call me
a mouse, daddy!

411
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,269
What?
- I thought you would like it.

412
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:22,036
Yes, you look nice. Very nice.
- Why did you call me a mouse?

413
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,028
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- That wasn't very nice of you.

414
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,028
Especially not when we've
invited the girls out for dinner!

415
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,118
You have?

416
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,668
I'm no mouse!
- No, you're not a mouse.

417
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,237
I'm a mouse. I'm a...

418
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,150
"Snuffle"!
- Yes, I'm a "snuffle".

419
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:55,072
Look, Markus, here's 100 kroner.

420
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,877
You can treat...
100 kroner... the girls.

421
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,709
You can give the girls...

422
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,997
Good evening, ladies.

423
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,555
Where is Markus?

424
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,551
Here.

425
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,550
You look so grown up.
- Handsome. I didn't recognize you.

426
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,355
A simple dress
can be made prettier -

427
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,951
with the help of an elegant handbag
and a pair of nice shoes.

428
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,914
I got them for my birthday.
- Was your photo in the newspaper?

429
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:10,071
If so, people will take it as a sign
that she's accepting visitors.

430
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,599
Let's go in.

431
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,796
So, the House of Lords
are out enjoying themselves?

432
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,515
My name is Markus.
- Is it really?

433
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,235
Yes, I would like to stress that.
Markus.

434
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,670
I'll never forget it.

435
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,509
Do you have a room
where we may plan the meal?

436
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,234
No, we don't.

437
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,236
We'll have to discuss the menu
with the head waiter then.

438
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,359
This way, ladies.

439
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,476
Markus, that's my name.

440
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:41,953
Have you booked a table?
- Yes, for Simonsen Junior.

441
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,553
Oh, yes. Please...

442
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,314
My name is Markus!
- My name is Dahl.

443
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,918
Have you decided yet?
- What shall we choose, Markus?

444
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,432
I don't know.
What would you like?

445
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,756
You decide.
- We're not used to restaurant food.

446
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,316
Choose something
you know is nice.

447
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,712
Guests can't choose the food at home,
so why should they in a restaurant?

448
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,311
That's right.
So, Junior, what do you want?

449
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,909
Four Anchois Vinaigrette,
four Boeuf Bourgogne -

450
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:02,078
and four SoufflÃ© d'Orange.

451
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,078
Would you repeat that?

452
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,989
Four Anchois Vinaigrette,
four Boeuf Bourgogne -

453
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,589
and four SoufflÃ© d'Orange.

454
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,473
What's "boeuf"?

455
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:22,473
It's pronounced "buff".
It's a French meat stew.

456
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,959
I know that.
But I usually say boeuf.

457
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,878
Boeuf!
- My name is Markus!

458
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:58,958
Here's four Anchois Vinaigrette.

459
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,679
Is that what it is?
- Yes.

460
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,437
Lovely!
- You may have mine, too.

461
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,196
Yes, mine, too.

462
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,351
We want to save our appetite.
- Yes, for the boeuf.

463
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,954
Thank you.
- You lucky devil!

464
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,638
Boeuf Bourgogne.

465
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:52,278
May I have a glass of water?

466
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:24,593
SoufflÃ© d'Orange, steaming hot.
The restaurant's pride and joy.

467
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,075
Excuse me...

468
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,634
Your name is Markus?

469
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,752
Your soufflÃ© is getting cold.
- It doesn't matter. I don't want it.

470
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,997
Don't you like our soufflÃ©?

471
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:15,151
I've invited guests to a restaurant.
What can I expect from the waiters?

472
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,478
I can expect to get polite and in
no way condescending attention.

473
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,832
The waiters' main task is
to make the guests comfortable!

474
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:30,036
The biggest mistake is to ignore the
guests or make them feel inferior.

475
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,594
And now I would like the bill,
if that's not too much trouble.

476
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,473
Yes, of course.

477
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,277
That was cool!
- He deserved it.

478
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,472
There are limits to
what I will put up with.

479
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,794
Here you are.

480
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,792
Excuse us for a moment.

481
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,156
You like the toilet!

482
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,876
1,950 kroner. I only have 500.
- I only have 100.

483
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,516
We have to call your dad.

484
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,554
No, I think it best
you call yours.

485
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,675
Yes, I thought as much.

486
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,312
Would you like to pay now?
- My dad will come and pay.

487
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,474
Would you like anything?
- No, thank you.

488
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,116
We'll just relax and dance.

489
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:48,633
What's that dance called?
- Markuska!

490
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,075
Thank you for the dance.
- Don't you want to dance any more?

491
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,397
I can't dance like you.
Nobody can.

492
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,275
The youngsters
have their own style.

493
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,635
Oh...

494
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:27,676
So, you're out enjoying yourselves?
- Thanks for the food, Mr. Simonsen.

495
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,429
It was really nice.
- I'm glad. They only just let me in.

496
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,189
Yes, your outfit isn't quite...

497
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,349
What have you done
to your nice curls?

498
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,915
I'm sorry.

499
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,959
I can't afford
another dinner like that.

500
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,118
We aren't millionaires.
- Yes, we are.

501
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,029
What?
- No. I mean no.

502
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,398
"I have dropped out of
"Money and Power".

503
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:10,388
I jump out a window and die
in episode number 78.

504
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:15,879
I quarrelled with the producer.
He treats me like an animal.

505
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,719
I've broken up with
Robert de Niro.

506
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,799
Right now I'm making
a commercial for mouthwash.

507
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:28,472
First I'm sad, then I gargle with
the mouthwash and get happy.

508
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:33,879
It's a fun part to play. I'll be
coming to Horten on the 12th..."

509
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,434
She's coming next week!

510
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:42,316
I refuse to meet her.
Dad and I are going to Copenhagen.

511
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,479
Make him go to Horten instead.
- I don't want to go to Horten.

512
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,035
You can't let her down now.

513
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:55,435
At least I won't have curls.

514
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:31,072
Do you play golf, Mr. Simonsen?
- Golf?

515
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,840
No, but it might be fun to try.

516
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,715
You should take a holiday
at Hotel Grand Ocean.

517
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,708
The best golf hotel in Norway.
- Oh, yes?

518
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,993
They have a green on the roof,
where you can practice your put.

519
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:51,513
Well, Markus and I are going
to Denmark to Tivoli.

520
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:54,996
I bet he would much rather
go to the Grand Ocean.

521
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,078
Would he?

522
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:03,716
Yes, if Sigmund can come.
- My parents said I could.

523
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:09,318
Where is this hotel?
- In Horten.

524
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,472
In Horten?

525
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,198
She's going to jump.
- No, Markus.

526
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,188
Things like that don't happen
in films. Only in real life.

527
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,756
Do you want to bet, Mr. Simonsen?
- Bet?

528
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:50,549
If she jumps, we go to Horten.
If not, you go to Denmark. Okay?

529
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,992
Okay.

530
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,155
Now I'm Diana, you're yourself.

531
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:41,272
What do you say?

532
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:45,268
Hello.
- Oh, hello. Who are you?

533
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,196
And...

534
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:56,391
I can't do this, Sigmund.
- Rubbish. Who are you?

535
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,679
Hello.
- Stop saying hello. Who are you?

536
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,678
Markus Simonsen Junior.

537
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,713
Hello, boys.

538
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,356
Do you know who is in Horten?

539
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,710
Diana Mortensen!

540
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,833
And she's having dinner
at this hotel.

541
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:27,359
I've booked a table for us, too.

542
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,597
What do you say to that?

543
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:35,430
If you're lucky, maybe you'll
get her autograph, Markus.

544
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,950
That would really be something.

545
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,309
It was this big!

546
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,797
I think fly-fishing is great.

547
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,834
I'm no specialist.
I don't know -

548
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:09,956
how many times the fly has
got stuck in a tree behind me, -

549
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,754
but it's a lot of fun.

550
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:18,318
Yes, I can see that.
- We'll try it one day, Markus.

551
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,671
What?
- Fly-fishing.

552
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:25,077
Does that taste good?

553
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,558
Fly-fishing doesn't mean
we'll fish flies. It means...

554
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,189
It's so nice to be back.

555
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,233
That's Diana Mortensen!
- Yes, we know.

556
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,596
Give us a nice smile, Diana!

557
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,074
Hello, baby.

558
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:58,990
Haven't you had enough now?
- No, give us a bit more.

559
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:49,353
Okay, boys. That's enough.

560
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,952
Yes, it's quite a lot of fun,
isn't it?

561
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:07,393
To bother those who can't defend
themselves. I bet you enjoy that.

562
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,115
But the party is over now!

563
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:17,556
Can't you see
that she's a human being?

564
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,877
But I don't suppose
you know what that means.

565
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:25,358
You all think she's a doll
you can treat as you like.

566
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,199
What a fantastic PR stunt, Diana.

567
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,869
Just shoot. We're not afraid of you.
You haven't caught us.

568
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,710
We don't give a shit about you.
You're just some lousy...

569
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,275
Mice!

570
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,433
You're so cute.

571
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,679
What's your name?
- My name is Markus!

572
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,549
Markus Simonsen,
that's my name.

573
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,115
Are you Markus? Markus Junior.

574
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,637
I know how long a tennis ball is.

575
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,830
Hello, everybody,
come and say hello to Markus!

576
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:25,032
Would you like to sit with us?

577
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,949
No, I have to go to my dad.
- Is your dad here?

578
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,596
Yes, he's sitting over there.

579
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,837
What on earth did you do?

580
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:47,478
I said hello to Diana Mortensen.
- Do you know her?

581
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:51,194
A little.

582
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,552
She wants to raise her glass
to you, Mr. Simonsen.

583
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,791
Why does she want to do that?

584
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,151
She probably thinks you look nice.

585
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:16,717
You have to raise your glass,
otherwise you're rude.

586
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:35,152
What shall I do?
- I'll fix this.

587
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:39,433
Thanks. Put it on room 312.
- I'll do that.

588
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,675
Thank you for coming...

589
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,235
Yes.

590
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:04,995
I'm Markus' father.
- I'm so glad we finally meet.

591
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,510
Yes... sure.

592
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,112
He's the silent type.

593
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:45,311
I'm also a bit silent.

594
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,755
What did you say?

595
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:54,317
Markus would like to meet you.
- It didn't seem like it.

596
01:11:54,520 --> 01:11:58,911
He just doesn't like publicity.

597
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,953
He's a bit eccentric.

598
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,950
Where does he want to meet me?
- In room 314.

599
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:10,596
Tell him I'd like to come.

600
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,712
I was wondering...

601
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,710
May I... please... have...

602
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:27,237
...your autograph?

603
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:40,119
But why didn't you just write
who you were?

604
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,200
Because...

605
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:50,038
Because I'm much better
at not being me.

606
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:58,908
I hope you are, too, Mr. Simonsen.
- What do you mean?

607
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,759
And don't call me Mr. Simonsen!

608
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:06,397
She's coming here in half an hour.
- What?

609
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:16,552
She wants to see you, Markus.
- But I'm not Markus, I'm Mons!

610
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,990
Are you a coward?
- Yes!

611
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,272
Just go out and enjoy yourself!

612
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:28,157
I'm not going to enjoy myself.
I'm going to play golf in my room!

613
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:36,594
One... two...

614
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,109
...three...

615
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,914
Markus?
- Yes?

616
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:49,672
I just wanted to wish you luck.
- I thought so.

617
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,558
Was it you who...
- Yes, I fixed a meeting.

618
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,679
Get lost!

619
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:12,354
What?

620
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,472
I want to be alone.

621
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,398
Don't you want me to stay
and support you?

622
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:37,833
No, sometimes a boy's got to do
what a boy's got to do.

623
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:23,429
Hi. Isn't your dad here?

624
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,476
No, it's just me.

625
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:35,549
Oh, but I thought...
- I have a letter for you.

626
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,558
From Markus?

627
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,479
I'll read it to you.

628
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:49,111
"I'm Markus. Markus Simonsen.

629
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:53,950
I've written all those letters.
Everything is a lie.

630
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:59,792
My dad is no millionaire,
and I'm no millionaire son.

631
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,549
Everybody calls me Mousy,
because I'm so scared.

632
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,194
I'm scared of everything.

633
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:10,313
The only thing I'm not scared of,
is not being myself.

634
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:15,116
That's really easy, but I'm not sure
everything should be so easy.

635
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,392
I'd like to try something
a bit difficult, too.

636
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,388
The most difficult thing I know,
is to be Markus.

637
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:27,993
I'm sorry I lied to you,
but I'm not completely sorry.

638
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,237
Because if I hadn't done it, -

639
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:36,673
I wouldn't have discovered
that I didn't really want to lie.

640
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:42,000
Best regards from
Markus Simonsen... myself."

641
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,472
Look, there's Sirius.

642
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:05,270
What?
- Sirius eight years ago.

643
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:12,392
That's how long it takes
the light to reach Earth.

644
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:20,636
I wish I was there now.
- Where?

645
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:25,152
On Sirius... eight years ago.

646
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:58,198
How was I?
- What?

647
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:07,511
Did my tears seem real?
I had to practice crying a lot.

648
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:15,358
You wish you were there, too,
don't you?

649
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:20,710
But that's not Sirius we see.

650
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:28,031
It's just something
that doesn't exist any longer.

651
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,512
My name isn't even Diana.

652
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,479
My name is Mette.

653
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:13,309
Yes, I thought so.

654
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,639
Do they really call you Mousy?
- Yes...

655
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:34,593
Do you know what they called me?
- No.

656
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:39,316
They called me Mette Mouse.
- Mette Mouse!

657
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:44,514
And I'm a really bad actress.
- Me too.

658
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:47,917
I didn't leave "Money and Power".
They sacked me.

659
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:51,795
The only job I could get was
the commercial for mouthwash.

660
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,518
Mouthwash can be useful, if you
have a foul breath. But you don't!

661
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:03,078
They had to withdraw the commercial.
Sales went down 30%.

662
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:07,478
And I never met Robert de Niro.
- Not me neither.

663
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:21,071
When are you going back?
- I'm not.

664
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:25,114
I'm staying here in Horten.

665
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:33,553
I'll say that I'm retiring because
I'm fed up with the jet set life.

666
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,356
Will they believe that?
- They believe I'm a star here.

667
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,949
You are a star.
- No, I'm not.

668
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,912
Yes, you are.

669
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:45,793
You are Sirius!
