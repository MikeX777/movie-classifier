1
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Easy, boy. We got
a long way to go.

2
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If you're looking for
your gun you won't find it.

3
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It was Pagones' idea.
He told me you'd
wake up shooting.

4
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
My shirt's been washed
and mended. Was that
Pagones' idea too?

5
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No, mine.

6
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And the wagon,
the little boy?

7
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Mine.

8
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Then Pagones' your husband.

9
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
My husband is dead.

10
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That leaves me
wondering why I'm not.

11
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You almost were
when we found you.

12
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Your horse was dead
and his body was stiff.

13
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You must have been there
an awfully long time.

14
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You gonna talk to him,
Cap, or do I?

15
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Mister, will you
come over here?

16
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We'd like to
have your name.

17
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Bannon, Ned Bannon.

18
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I guess the woman, Ellen,
I guess she told you
how we found you.

19
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes, she told me.

20
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Do you mind saying
just how you
drew that bullet?

21
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I mean, your horse dead,
you shot up and all...

22
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You got to understand
how it is, mister.

23
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We got women and children
to think about.

24
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Maybe whoever shot you,
maybe they might get a notion
to come lookin' for you,

25
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
finish the job.

26
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We're waitin', Yankee.

27
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I was travelin' west.

28
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Where to?
Where you going?

29
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Bishop's Valley.

30
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Never heard of it.

31
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Well, that's funny,
you're headin' for it.

32
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I said I never
heard of it.

33
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let him go on, Pagones.

34
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
When I hit that rise
in the trail where you
found me, I guess,

35
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I ran onto a small bunch
of cattle, about a dozen
hands ridin' herd.

36
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Just about as
I started wonderin'

37
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
what a small outfit like
that was doin' around here,

38
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
someone in the rocks put
a bullet in my horse,

39
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and then in me.

40
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But why? I mean,
why would he do that if
you wasn't doin' nothing?

41
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't know. Unless I was
seein' somethin' I wasn't
supposed to be seein'.

42
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Well, did you see him?
Did you see who shot you?

43
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Not clear enough.

44
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Mister, you must
have seen somethin'.

45
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Fancy spurs and a rifle
is all I seem to remember.

46
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
How come
we didn't see no cattle,
no tracks, nothin'?

47
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You know, I was just
figurin' to ask you
that same question.

48
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What's that
supposed to mean?

49
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
All right, all right,
that's enough palaverin'
for one night.

50
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Not by
a long shot, it ain't.

51
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Come on, mister,
want you to sit down,
look at that side.

52
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Somebody get this
fella some food.

53
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I said I ain't
done talkin'!

54
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Pagones, he's wounded.
He hasn't eaten in days.

55
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I know he ain't eaten.
I ain't got nothin'
against his eatin'.

56
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I want to hear
what he has to say.

57
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Pagones...

58
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yankees ought to be good
at talkin', they're good
at everything else...

59
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Rapin', burnin', thievin'...

60
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You still
fightin' the war?

61
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
...but mostly burnin'.
Don't make much difference
what they burn.

62
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Cattle, chicken,
women, kids...

63
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Just like the smell
of roastin' flesh,
ain't that so, Yankee?

64
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I said ain't that so!

65
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You go to hell.

66
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Don't do it, Pagones!
You'll kill him.

67
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I warned ya. I warned you
it was a mistake to bring
him but you wouldn't listen.

68
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Do you see that?
He backed down.

69
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Backed down nothin',
he knew he'd
have killed him.

70
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll get you some coffee.

71
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You done all right, mister.
For a moment there,
you had me worried,

72
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
but you done all right.

73
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Mary, bring Mr. Bannon
here some food.

74
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Sit down.
Here you are, sir.

75
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I reckon seein' them
Union colors on you was
what got him all riled up.

76
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The Yankees burned his
home down durin' the war.

77
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That happened to a lot
of people, both sides.

78
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, it did at that.
Me among 'em.

79
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Only I got the wife and kid
out before mine went down.

80
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Pagones, he didn't.

81
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Mmm...
That tender?

82
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Ah, it's not bad.

83
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That was a mean-lookin'
wound. I never seen
a gun wound like it.

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There was a hole the
size of a silver dollar
where it came out.

85
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Lucky thing it
missed the bone.

86
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Here, Papa.
Thanks. Now, Mary, you
and your ma go on to bed.

87
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll be along.
Mary, do you hear me?

88
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes, Papa.

89
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Mary, I'll walk you
to your wagon.

90
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
My daughter and that
young fella are
fixin' to get married

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
as soon as we get settled.

92
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Where would that be?

93
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
California.

94
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What?

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Uh-huh, that's
where we're headin'.

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
'Course some of us
may trail north
up into Oregon.

97
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What are you doin'
way down here?

98
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I mean, if it's the coast
you're after, you should
be up on the Humboldt.

99
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We're just takin'
this trail, that's all.

100
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What trail? There's no trail.
Not past Bishop's Valley.

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Just a series of ridges
no wagon's ever been
across, and desert.

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But there is a trail,
a good trail, right, Cap?

103
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Why, sure there is.
All the way through.

104
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No high passes, just good
green land once we get beyond
this here one dry stretch.

105
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Who told you this?

106
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why, I did.

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How's the patient,
Mr. Judson?

108
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well, he's ornery,
Mr. Harper. Full of
talk about no trail.

109
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No trail?

110
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, Mr. Bannon's
obviously not been in
this region too long.

111
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Wouldn't you say so,
Mr. Purcell?

112
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'd say so.

113
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Long enough to know
this trail leads to
Bishop's Valley, not beyond.

114
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There's nothin' beyond.

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Bishop's Valley. Not too
many people have heard
of that place, Mr. Bannon.

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I've heard of it.

117
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Is this somethin' we ought
to know about, Mr. Harper?

118
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a big
pasture land, Cap.
About thirty miles of it.

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Man there by the name
of Bishop. Hardy Bishop.

120
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He lets his cattle
run loose like he
owns every inch of it.

121
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You'll see for yourself,
we cut through it in
a couple of days.

122
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Cut through it?
Cut through Bishop's Valley?

123
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
As far as Onion Creek.
Then we switch back
over Shepherd's Pass.

124
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You work there, mister?
Is that it,
did you work there?

125
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Before the war.

126
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And yet you say
there's no trail?

127
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Not out of
that valley, there isn't.

128
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Tell me, Mr. Bannon,
you've been away
a long time?

129
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Since the war.

130
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hmmm. Then someone ought to
tell you. They broke that
trail about a year ago.

131
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Tell him about it,
Mr. Purcell.

132
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Just a year ago.

133
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, gentlemen,
it's been a long day.

134
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, guess I'll turn in.

135
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's all turn in, we'll
get a fresh start
in the mornin'.

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
'Night, Mr. Bannon.

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
If there's anything I can
do for you, Mr. Bannon...

138
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll talk to Cap and
the others about
your staying with us

139
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
at least as far
as the Valley.

140
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They're a little upset
tonight but I don't think
it'll be much of a problem.

141
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Besides, we can use
a good trail man.
Good night.

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm going to stretch out
by the fire. I just
came for my pillow.

143
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You've made a good start,
first Pagones,
and then Harper.

144
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This Harper...

145
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What about him?

146
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
How'd he come to be
with this wagon train?

147
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We'd gathered in
Cannon City, to
organize our equipment

148
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
before traveling west
over the Humboldt.

149
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We met Harper,
and his friend Purcell.

150
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
They said they were
traveling west themselves
and asked us to join them.

151
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
They said that this new trail
they knew about through
the valley was shorter

152
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and easier by
hundreds of miles.

153
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, one thing
they didn't tell you.

154
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Nobody's ever cut through
Hardy Bishop's land and
lived to see the other side.

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Why should this man
Bishop try to stop us?

156
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What harm could
we possibly cause just
by passing through?

157
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It isn't a matter of harm.
You'd be breaking the law.
Bishop's law.

158
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Nobody does that.
And I think
Harper knows it.

159
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
If he knew it, why would he
bring us this way?

160
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't know.
Beats me.

161
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You know a lot about this man
Bishop, don't you?

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He's my half-brother.

163
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, I see. Well, then you can
talk to him for us.

164
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You owe us
that much, I think.

165
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Maybe I do.

166
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But you see, if anything,
I'm going to be
even less welcome

167
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
in that valley than you are.

168
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Eighty four head, hear?
Was that it, Stark?

169
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Eighty four.

170
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It'd take a fool or
a maniac to rustle cattle

171
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
off of my land without
some inside help.

172
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
And I know
a sight of both.

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Now who was it? How
much did he give you?

174
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I tell you, Mr. Bishop,
I never seen him.

175
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I had nothin' to
do with it. I've got
better sense than that.

176
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Sounds to me like
he's tellin' the truth, Hardy.

177
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Well, I don't think so.

178
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Get your gear and be
out of here in 10 minutes.

179
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And don't come back.

180
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Chavez is comin'.

181
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Well?

182
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Ah, we lost 'em.

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Eighty four head of cattle
and you lost 'em?

184
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We trailed 'em as far
as Jawbone Canyon but
there was a lot of wind,

185
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the dust covered
their tracks.

186
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Well, they weren't
prime stock, Mr. Bishop.

187
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't care if a cow's
fifteen years old
and three-legged,

188
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
if it's a Bishop cow.

189
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Nobody steals my beef
and gets away with it.

190
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
At least they wouldn't
if I had a crew that
knew its business.

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
From now on, there'll be
two men at every line
cabin 24 hours a day.

192
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And one man better
be awake all the time.

193
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Go on, get
something to eat.

194
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Something
else wrong?

195
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why, uh...
I don't know, sir.

196
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
We, we saw a wagon train.

197
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What?

198
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's right, sir.
Headin' this way.

199
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Those thievin'
cattle rustlers?

200
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
No, sir couldn't be.
These people hardly got enough
stock to haul their gear.

201
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
They're southerners
for the most part.

202
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We spotted them coming
out of the north canyon.

203
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
How many were there?

204
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Don't know. They got
women and kids
with 'em though.

205
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Did they see you?

206
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Ah, I do not think so.

207
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
One of them
was a Yankee.
A Union soldier.

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Officer, it looked like.

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Blue coat.
Gold stripe on his pants.

210
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And he was ridin' point,
well, like he knew the trail.

211
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Bannon?

212
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I... I'm not sure.

213
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Bannon.
We didn't see
him very close...

214
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Who else would...

215
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
No. He wouldn't have
the guts to come back here.

216
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
If it was one thing
Bannon had, Hardy,
it was guts.

217
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But no sense.

218
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If he had any, he'd
know what to expect
if he came back here.

219
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Say those wagons,
Mr. Bishop, we could,

220
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
well, we could turn 'em
at the ridge before they
set their stock to grazin'.

221
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The wagons will wait.

222
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Hardy, you ought to
give it a lot of thought

223
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
before you do something
you'll be sorry for.

224
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I've given it thought.
For four years
I've givin' it thought.

225
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
And in case I forgot to,
there's a grave out there
in the meadow to remind me.

226
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Billy was executed by
the Federal Government.

227
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
For fighting for
what he believed in!

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Quantrell's raiders.
Bully boys. Lootin',
burnin', killin'.

229
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
North and South alike,
made no difference to him.
He was having a picnic!

230
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What's the difference.
My boy is lying out
there in a stinkin' hole

231
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and Bannon
put him there.

232
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's all over and
done with, Hardy.

233
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It will be, soon.

234
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Like you said, Stark,
one thing Bannon
had was guts.

235
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And I'm gonna spill
'em all over the ground.

236
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Did this Bannon gent
really kill Bishop's son?

237
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
In a way,
I suppose he did.

238
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Young Bishop, he was
a bad kid almost from
the time he could walk.

239
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And Hardy, heh, he
spoiled him rotten. He was
no good. No good at all.

240
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Bad enough to kill?

241
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Bad enough to kill.

242
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Somebody had to
do it someday.
We all knew that.

243
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
All except Bishop, huh?

244
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Bannon was a Union troop
commander, cavalry.

245
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Some of Quantrell's boys,
Billy included,

246
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
made the mistake
of underestimating him.

247
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
They got caught.
Tried and executed
the same day.

248
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I brought his body
back from Leavenworth
a week later.

249
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Well, then,
Bannon didn't kill him.

250
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He didn't help him
to get way either.

251
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yee-haw!

252
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yee-haw!

253
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Whoo-hoo!

254
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We're there! We're there,
I tell you! Man,
wait'll you see it!

255
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Bishop's Valley?
Yeah, couple o' miles up!

256
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yoo-hoo!
Man, there's grass
two feet deep!

257
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Where's Bannon?
Up ahead.

258
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's green, man,
you never saw
nothin' like it!

259
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Spread the word, Dud.
Tell 'em to pick 'em up...

260
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, there she is.

261
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Holy Saint George!

262
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Thirty miles of the
richest pasture land
this side of Salt Lake.

263
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Enough water, timber
and game to last
a man a lifetime.

264
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
All for the taking.

265
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What did you say?

266
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Let's take 'em down
to that meadow, Cap.

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Camp there for a day
or two and rest up
before going on.

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What do you say?
What're we waitin' for.
Let's take 'em!

269
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yee-haw!

270
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
"All for the takin'",
is that what you said?

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Did I, Mr. Bannon?

272
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You give me that bucket.
Go on and play.

273
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Hello. We haven't
seen much of you lately.

274
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Sorry.
Oh, nothing to
be sorry about.

275
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hey, how's your side?

276
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm as good
as new, thanks.

277
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Light the fire!

278
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
How long do you think
it will be before
he pays us a visit?

279
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Ordinarily, the wagon
train would never have
gotten this far.

280
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
He must be waitin' for me.

281
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Do you think Bishop
knows you're with us?

282
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
He knows, all right.
We've been watched
for the past three days.

283
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Well, when are you
going to see him?

284
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Soon. Couple of things
I'd like to find out first.

285
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
One of 'em is what this
Harper is really up to.

286
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Why
does he have to be
up to something?

287
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You're so suspicious,
Mr. Bannon.

288
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Could be.

289
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Another thing I'd like to
find out is, about you.

290
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What are you doin'
out here alone?

291
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Going west, like everybody
else in the wagon train.

292
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You're not the type,
any more than Harper is.

293
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Oh? What type am I?

294
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Suppose you tell me.

295
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
My husband was killed
in the war. I was left
all alone with my son.

296
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
So I decided to sell
all my furniture, everything
I had left, and head west.

297
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Then I met these
people in St. Jo.

298
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm sorry about
your husband.

299
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Thank you.

300
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
There's just one
thing doesn't figure.

301
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You bein' alone all
this time. Like I said,
you're not the type.

302
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You're a man's woman.
I just haven't figured
out which man yet.

303
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Well, when you do figure
it out, let me know.

304
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Wait a minute. I'm sorry.

305
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I just wanted to get you
mad enough so you'd tell
me something about Harper.

306
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Oh, I see! You've decided
that I'm Harper's woman.
Is that it?

307
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Well, I could do worse.
Like you, for instance.

308
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Man, what a notion!
Now, why didn't I think
of somethin' like that!

309
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Somethin' like what?

310
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Stayin' on.

311
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What did you say?

312
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Why, it's Harper's idea.
Why go to California, he says.

313
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Got everything we
need right here.

314
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Strip this land,
get the seed in...
Where is he?

315
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Harper? Oh, he's
up by the wagons.
Pagones' wagon, I think.

316
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Talkin' it over
with Cap and...
What got into him?

317
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So, all I'm sayin' is,
why go on?

318
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Now, you all want homes,
with free land and plenty
of water and game and sun.

319
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
A place to raise
your kids, maybe.

320
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Or forget some sore
memories. Well, what
better place than this?

321
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Now look, I figure it'll
take you about a month
to build your homes.

322
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You all have plenty of
tools and there's enough
timber here to build a town.

323
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
In the meantime, you can
start in with your plantin'.

324
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yeah, but what
about California?

325
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You can all still
go on if you want.

326
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
'Course it'll mean
losing a year's harvest.

327
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And there's always the
Indians to worry about.

328
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I like it.
I like what he says.

329
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Just a minute!
You can't live here,
you don't own this land.

330
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Well, there's plenty
here for us all.

331
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Not here there isn't.
This land belongs
to Hardy Bishop.

332
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He settled it.
He owns it.

333
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You're mistaken, Bannon.
This is government territory.

334
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Every citizen has
the right to homestead.

335
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
You try that, all you'll
have is a pack of widows.

336
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
This valley is
30 miles long. I say there's
room here for all of us.

337
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Now, if Bishop
doesn't think so...

338
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Well, I think we can handle
trouble if it comes to that.

339
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That
makes sense to me.
I'm for stayin'.

340
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Now I get it.

341
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Get what, Mr. Bannon?

342
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You never intended to
cross that pass, Harper.

343
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Never intended to from
the day you left St. Jo.

344
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Mr. Bannon, we promised
to bring you as far
as Bishop's Valley.

345
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Well, this is
Bishop's Valley.

346
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Dud, bring him his horse.

347
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Oh,
and one thing more.

348
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
When you see Bishop,
tell him this is a big land.
Too big for one man, really.

349
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I seen him. He's comin'.

350
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Bannon?
Yeah.

351
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
All right, I'll tell him.

352
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I want the boys
kept out of this.

353
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
They know.

354
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Bannon only did what
he thought was right, Hardy.

355
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
He rates better than that.

356
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Not from me, he don't.

357
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Hello, Hardy.

358
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Get off of
my range, Bannon!

359
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I want to talk to you.

360
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Just two
rounds left, Ned.

361
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Just one more to waste.
Now turn around
and get outta here.

362
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
And take that mangy bunch
of squatters with you.

363
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
He don't want to
kill you, Ned. Get out
of here before he has to.

364
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Not until we talk.

365
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
We got
nothing to talk about.

366
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You just got one
shell left, Hardy.

367
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Are you going to use it?

368
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You're going to
listen to me, Hardy.

369
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You're going to listen
if I have to beat it into you.

370
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Stay down, Hardy.
Don't make me do any more.

371
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
All right, somebody
help him up.

372
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Charley, Red.

373
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Take him to his room.

374
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
He really belted you.
Hurt much?

375
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
What do you think?

376
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
There's some stuff over in
the bunkhouse. Ask the boys.
They'll fix you up.

377
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Glad to have you back, Ned.

378
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Thanks.

379
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Here you are.

380
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
All right, Charley.

381
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Lie back.

382
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Come on, lie back.

383
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Sittin' there like
a wounded buck,
bleedin' half to death.

384
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
He still here?

385
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Yep.

386
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I didn't want to kill him.

387
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I know.

388
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I still don't.
But I'm going to.

389
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
No, you're not.

390
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I gave him more of
a chance than I ever
gave a man before.

391
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He's still got a chance.
He can get out of here
before I'm on my feet again.

392
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
He won't go, Hardy.

393
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Then, I'll kill him.

394
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
No, you won't. I know
you better than that.

395
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Why? Because he's my
own flesh and blood?

396
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
You don't know me
as well as you think.

397
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Hardy, you know
Billy was no good.

398
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
He was bound to
get himself killed
sooner or later.

399
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Get outta here.

400
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Ned didn't kill him.
You know that, too.

401
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Out, Stark!
Not yet.

402
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Why don't you admit it?

403
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Ned's always been more
of a son to you than
Billy ever could be.

404
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You know what
kind of a man he is,
what principles he lives by.

405
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
He'd have done
the same if Billy had
been his own son.

406
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Tell the boys to be
ready to ride tomorrow.
All of 'em.

407
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
We'll be doin' a little
squatter-chasin'.

408
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
What about Ned?

409
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
You refusin' to take
orders, after 20 years?

410
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Go on, tell 'em
what I said.

411
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
All right.

412
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Talk to him, Hardy,
that's all he wants.

413
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Then send him away
if you still want to.

414
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
He'll go.

415
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But if he does, you'll
be losin' one of the
few people in this world

416
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
who ever cared
a tinker's damn about you.

417
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Charley.

418
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Where is that Comanche!

419
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Charley!

420
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Morning.

421
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I want a steak. Rare.
I mean rare.
Put a candle under it.

422
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh, wait a minute.
Maybe you'd better
make that...

423
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I got some mush.
Fresh cooked.

424
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
All right.
Make it two.

425
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Morning.
I heard you
the first time.

426
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Can we talk now, Hardy?

427
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
No.

428
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's been four years.
I've got a lot of
things to say to you.

429
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I don't want to hear
anything more about Billy.
I want to close the book.

430
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Me too, Hardy. Me too.

431
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Red.

432
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Where's Stark?

433
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
He's over at the barn,
Mr. Bishop.

434
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Tell him we'll be
ridin' in 20 minutes.

435
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
They won't run, Hardy.

436
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
They'll run.
Not this bunch.

437
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I know
I came in with 'em.

438
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Don't think I ain't been
wonderin' about that.

439
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
If you'd listen
instead of flyin' off...

440
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'll listen for 20 minutes.

441
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I'll take that, Hardy.

442
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Hungry, homeless,
stragglers. Call 'em
what you want,

443
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
nothin' you said's gonna
keep me from runnin'
'em off my land.

444
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And I told you they
won't run. Will you try
and understand that?

445
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You think you're going
to go bustin' in
and scare 'em out.

446
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Well, they've been
scared by experts.

447
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
The only way you're gonna
run 'em off is to put
'em underground.

448
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I can do that, too.

449
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Even if it means killin'
women and kids?

450
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I didn't bring those
women and kids in here.
That was their own doing.

451
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
No, it wasn't, it was Harper,
I keep tellin' ya.

452
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
He brought 'em here.
He stopped 'em here.

453
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
You just sit there
and won't listen.

454
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
All you can think of
is how you're gonna
chop 'em up and run 'em off.

455
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Well, what am I supposed
to think of, then?

456
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Where is it different
than it ever was?

457
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
People comin' in here,
diggin' up my range.

458
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
First an acre, then 10,
then half the valley.

459
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
All right, so Harper brought
'em in here. What are
you askin' of me, Ned?

460
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm askin' you to
let me find out why.

461
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Oh, it's clear enough.
He's after farming.

462
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Harper's no more a farmer
than Charley there.

463
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Look, I don't know
what he's up to any
more than you do.

464
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
But it's something. It's like
he was inviting trouble,
like he wanted it. Why?

465
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
What can he expect
to do with a handful
of people like that?

466
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
They're a hard headed
bunch and right now
they think he's God.

467
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
But he's got to
have an angle and
I'm going to find it.

468
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
How're you gonna do it?
In time.

469
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I ain't got time.

470
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Hardy, you got
nothin' else but.

471
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Those cattle you ran into,

472
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
you think they were
that bunch of mine
that were rustled?

473
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
From what you tell me,
about eighty head,
dozen men ridin' herd.

474
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You think Harper's
mixed up in that?

475
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I don't see how.

476
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The man who shot you,
the one with the gold-plated
rifle and the fancy spurs...

477
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
They were the first things
I looked for. No one
in the wagon train had 'em.

478
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
All right, I'll make
a deal with you.
We'll do it your way.

479
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Three days your way.
Then we do it mine.

480
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
You got a deal.

481
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'll tell Stark and Chavez,
they'll work with you.

482
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Uh, anything
else you want?

483
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Nothin' you got.

484
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Meaning what?

485
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You got a bushwhacker
with a gold-plated rifle?

486
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Oh, his kind don't
stay in one place.
Not for long they don't.

487
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
He's half way to Texas.
Wait here, I'll get Stark.

488
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Well, it appears to me
this'd be about the best
way for everybody.

489
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Each family section touches
the stream so there'll never
be any water problems.

490
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
There's both graze and
timber on each section,
dividin' it up this way.

491
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
No one part of the valley
seems to be any better
or worse than any other part,

492
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
so all we got to do is
to decide who lives where.

493
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Why don't you just number
the sections on your map,

494
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
and then draw those
numbers out of a hat?

495
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Hey, that's a good idea,
boy. I got some paper
over there in my wagon,

496
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'll get it and make
up the numbers.

497
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Hey, Mort, what about
you? You'll be settlin'
here too, won't you.

498
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I sure will.
Good, you know, I'm gonna
build my house facin' east,

499
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
with the main room
here, like this.

500
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
To catch the morning sun.

501
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And me and ma's
bedroom over here,

502
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and Ellen and
Will over here.

503
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Oh, you moving in with
the Judsons, Ellen,
you and your boy?

504
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Well, I tried to talk
him out of it but
you know Mr. Judson.

505
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
No, I won't hear
another word.

506
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Besides, the way things
are shapin' up, looks like

507
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
that young fella
Dud's gonna make off
with the only one I got.

508
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Pa.
Oh, now Ma.

509
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Mort's no fool,
he's got eyes.

510
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Mary and Dud - yowlin'
around here like a pair
of sacked-up cats.

511
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
We'll throw 'em both
in the same sack,
that'll cure 'em.

512
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Pa!
I hear you.

513
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Now look, when you get ready
to build your own place,
you let me know, you hear?

514
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm a pretty fair
country carpenter.

515
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
You'll hear.

516
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You know, Ellen, I sort
of thought you'd have

517
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
a hankering for
the same thing.

518
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Oh? Like what?

519
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Oh, like Mary, home
of your own, a man.

520
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Some day, maybe.

521
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You're not happy,
Ellen, I know that.

522
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
And I know
the reason why, too.

523
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh, you do?

524
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Yes. You're not
a child, like Mary.

525
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
A woman like you who's been
married, there's things she
needs to make her happy,

526
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
things which she...

527
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Look, Mort, if that's
a proposal, thanks.
I'll think about it.

528
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
But in the meantime,
I'm pretty busy.

529
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Hey, Mort!

530
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
What do you
suppose they want?

531
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Anything I can
do for you?

532
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
We are riding by,
we see you from the trees.

533
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Are you Bishop's men?
No, we're miners.

534
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Si, we have a little
mine back in the hills.

535
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
We run low on tobacco,
figured to buy
some off you.

536
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I think I can fix
'em up. This way.

537
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Hey, quite a man, that Mort.
No price too high
on a fella like that.

538
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
You're wrong, Adam.
Sometimes the price
can be too high.

539
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Purcell.

540
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Here's your tobacco.

541
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You, uh, you know
what you're to do?

542
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
We wait for Bishop to come
out to attack this train.

543
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Then my men and me,
we take his ranch.

544
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
When he returns,
we chew up what
he's got left.

545
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You shouldn't
have any trouble.

546
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Figure this bunch'll
knock off 10 or 12
before they're wiped out,

547
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
probably wound
as many more.

548
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Bishop'll be
a sittin' duck for you.

549
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
And for this you
agree to pay me...

550
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Half
the cattle we get.

551
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Well?

552
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
More.

553
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Look, Zarata,
we made a deal.

554
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
In fact...

555
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
In fact,

556
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I am wondering what
is to keep me from
taking all of it.

557
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
After all,

558
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
you're only two.

559
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
We are twelve.

560
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
All right, take it.
Take it all.

561
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Something over 5,000
head of cattle.

562
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Only that's a lot
to unload, Zarata.

563
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Where you gonna do it?

564
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Remember you're wanted
in every state and territory
south of the Missouri.

565
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
They know you,
they'll be lookin' for ya.

566
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I have friends.
Sure. Sure,
you have friends.

567
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
What'd they pay you
for the 80 odd head

568
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
you rustled out of
Bishop's herd last week.

569
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
How you know about this?

570
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
What was it, Zarata?
Three, four dollars a head?

571
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Six.
I'll get you twenty.

572
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Where?

573
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That's my business.

574
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Twenty, uh? Really twenty.
You get that?

575
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Cash.

576
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So you see,
cut me out and
you're the loser.

577
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Anythin' else?

578
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
This woman...
What?

579
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
It is curiosity,
but I think I see
this woman.

580
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I doubt that.

581
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
St. Louis.

582
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I think maybe St. Louis,
during the war.

583
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
She was in Virginia
during the war.

584
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
She's never been
in St. Louis.
Perhaps...

585
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Now listen to me,
both of you.

586
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I figure Bishop to send
his roughnecks down here

587
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
to try and bluff
these people off.

588
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Which means you
figured just about right.

589
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Friend of yours?

590
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Uh-uh, you's two
stay here.

591
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Last thing we need
is for him to
recognize you.

592
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Come on, Purcell.

593
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Howdy, Bannon.

594
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Judson.

595
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Get 'em around.
I want 'em
all to hear.

596
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Come on everybody,
over here.

597
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
You'll come over,
Mr. Bannon wants
to talk to ya.

598
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Will! Will!

599
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
If you're here to run
us of, Bannon...

600
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
No such thing.
I owe these people
too much for that.

601
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
All right. Here it is.

602
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,000
This is private land.
You've all been told that,

603
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
but you don't believe it.

604
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Said he wasn't tryin'
to run us off.

605
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I'm not.

606
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I'm here to get you
to leave peacefully.

607
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
And what if we don't?

608
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Hardy Bishop, he has 20 men
to see that you do.

609
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
One way or another.

610
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Why don't you
clear off, Bannon!

611
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Yeah, bring your 20,
we'll show you
a match for 'em.

612
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Wait a minute, we don't want
to fight with these boys.

613
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Look. Look, I know
how you feel, havin' to leave

614
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
when you thought
you had homes.

615
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
If it were my land...
But it's not.

616
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,000
And I am grateful
to you for saving my life.

617
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
We ain't likely
to make the same
mistake twice.

618
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Aah, what're
we even listenin' to him for?

619
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Oh, who's listenin'.

620
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Maybe I can make
your goin' easier.

621
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
You can take
all the game you want,

622
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
at least enough to last
you till California.

623
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Could probably use
a few good milk cows,
a couple of bulls, maybe.

624
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Start your own herd
in the spring.

625
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
You're low on ammunition,
so we can help
you out there.

626
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And I'll see what we can
do about flour and lard.

627
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Now you'll have to cut North
to make the Humboldt.

628
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It's a pretty tricky stretch,
but don't worry about it,

629
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I'll trail you there myself.

630
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
From there on,
you're on your own.

631
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Well, that's it.

632
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Milk cows, you hear that?

633
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
We could start
our own herd!

634
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Aw, you can swallow
that swill if you wanna,

635
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
but I ain't gonna!
I say he's lyin'!

636
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Nobody's lying.

637
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Of course, he's lying!

638
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Wait a minute, Harper.
I'm talkin' to these people.

639
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Let 'em make up
their own minds for once.

640
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Why should Bishop give
you anything, Bannon?

641
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Why you? He's never
given anything to anybody
in his whole life.

642
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Mort, who said that
we was takin' anything?

643
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
You don't have to decide
now. Think about it.

644
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Bulls and cows, Mort!
The kids ain't seen much milk.

645
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
All right, go ahead,
take it! Take his deal!

646
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
That's what he wants
to scare you off your land.

647
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Giving you a lot
of empty promises
he never intends keeping!

648
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
That makes no sense!

649
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
It does to me!
I say Harper's right.

650
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Well, maybe he is
and maybe he ain't.

651
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
All right, now listen to me,
all of you.

652
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Have I failed you yet?
No.

653
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Now answer
me truthfully... Did I trail
you across,

654
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
get you out here
to this land,

655
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
good land for
your homes,

656
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
a greater land than
you ever dreamed of.

657
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Yeah, but I think that
you're forgettin'
Mr. Bannon...

658
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Let him go on.

659
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Now when your very lives
depend on it you begin
to doubt me.

660
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Well, I mean what
am I gonna say?

661
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Doubt me against Cap here,

662
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
or maybe Judson, yes.

663
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
But certainly not against
this saddle-trash.

664
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yeah, that's right,
you heard me.
Saddle-trash.

665
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Now there's one for you.

666
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Look at him, look at his
hand just itchin'
to go for that gun.

667
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Don't worry, he won't go
for it not right now he won't.

668
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
He'll wait till some
dark night, then he'll come

669
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
sneakin' in on his belly
like a snake.

670
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Mama!

671
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Mama!

672
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Oh, how did he get
to do that?

673
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Mama!

674
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Take care of her,
please, ma'am.

675
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Take it easy.

676
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Get him out of here, quick!

677
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
He's gettin' away!

678
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Somebody gimme a gun!

679
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Hold it!

680
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
That's what you can
expect from Bishop,

681
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
killing and brutality.

682
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
He's wrong.

683
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Can't hold 'em back much
longer, it'll take just
one to start it.

684
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
All right, back off.

685
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Hold your fire, men!
Hold it! Hold your fire!

686
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You can't stop 'em!

687
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Don't anyone follow 'em.
They'll double back and
pick you off one at time,

688
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
you'll never know
what hit ya.

689
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Now the first thing we have
to do is to get these
wagons in a circle.

690
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Mr. Harper, I'd say the first
thing was to give Mrs. Judson,
there, a proper burial.

691
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You're right, Cap.
Get your bible.

692
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Bannon!

693
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
How is he?
Bad.

694
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Can you get him back?
Not on horseback,
he is bleeding too much.

695
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Better go back to the ranch
and get a buckboard.

696
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
You stay here with Red.

697
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Where are you going?

698
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
When Bishop sees that kid,
I figure I got till just then

699
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
to get those people
out of here.

700
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Are you crazy, Ned?

701
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
How close you think
you will get after Red
killed that woman.

702
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Red didn't kill her.
But I seen him!

703
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
What you saw
was Red firing and
the woman falling down.

704
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
But there was something else.
What?

705
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
A bullet hole in her back.
Did you see it?

706
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
It was about the size
of your finger.

707
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
But when they turned
her over, there was a hole

708
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
big enough
to put your fist in.

709
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
It takes a special kind
of bullet to make
a hole like that

710
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
and Red wasn't carrying it.

711
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It's a ripping thing, Stark.

712
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Hollow-nosed and
split in the end.

713
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
And when they hit,
they expand, just flatten out.

714
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You put one in the right
place, they'll blow half
your guts out.

715
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
But why would anyone want
to shoot that woman?

716
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
To make 'em think
it was us.

717
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
To fill 'em so full of hate
and bitterness,

718
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
that nothin' short of war
would run 'em outta here.

719
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Them bullets.
Who'd use a thing like that?

720
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I can think of a couple
who might, and one who has,

721
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
that bushwhacker
who put one in me.

722
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
"Thou preparest
a table before me

723
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
"in the presence of
mine enemies.

724
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
"Thou annointest my head
with oil.

725
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
"My cup runneth over.

726
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
"Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow me

727
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
"all the days of my life
and I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."

728
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Amen.

729
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
A nice funeral?
Where's Barrett?

730
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Plenty tears?
Much prayin'?

731
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I said, where's Barrett?

732
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
With his horse.
A loose shoe.

733
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And where's yours?

734
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
All right, you ride.

735
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Without food? I would not
do that to an animal.

736
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Get him some food.

737
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You can eat it
on the way.

738
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Barrett will follow
as soon as he's done
with his horse.

739
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Now how long will it take
you to get to your men?

740
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
An hour.

741
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And from there
to Bishop's ranch?

742
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,000
An hour.

743
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Now I don't know when
Bishop is coming out.

744
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
He may wait till dawn.

745
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,000
But I have an idea
when he sees the job

746
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I did on the puncher of his,
it'll be tonight.

747
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Then we go in, huh?
When he rides out
we go in.

748
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
No. You post a lookout
first. Use Barrett.

749
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
And you?

750
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
What you do when
this pot is on the fire?

751
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Don't worry about me.
I'll keep the pot boiling
from this end.

752
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
From the looks of things
it shouldn't be too hard.

753
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
They look mean enough
to start their own war.

754
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
Jerky!
Best I could do.

755
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Dried beef is small payment,
what I am to do.

756
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
You bring this off right,
mi amigo,

757
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
and tomorrow night
you'll have fresh beef.

758
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Buena suerte.

759
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Hey? St. Louis!

760
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
What? Who's that?

761
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Yeah, sure. St. Louis.

762
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,000
First I think maybe
it is curiosity,
but then I remember.

763
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I don't know you.

764
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
I don't know what
you're talking about.

765
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
You know.

766
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Maybe you fool these
farmers, this Harper, si.

767
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
But you cannot fool Zarata!

768
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I never saw you
before in my life.

769
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
No. But I see you.

770
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
During the war in that
stinking dump you
gin around in.

771
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Si, but you are right
about one thing,

772
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
you do not see Zarata.

773
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
No. All you see
are those officers,

774
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
those fancy ranchers who
come peacocking about,

775
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
their pockets full of silver!

776
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
You and your fancy feathers!

777
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You're wrong.

778
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
You're wrong,

779
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
it isn't that way at all.

780
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
How cruel of me
to think so.

781
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,000
You don't understand.

782
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
It was in another world.

783
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
You are wrong
to run from me.

784
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
After all, consider really,

785
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
am I so different
from those officers?

786
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Please.

787
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Drop that knife!

788
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I said drop it!

789
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Turn around!

790
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Hold on to this.

791
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
You don't much care how
you do it, do you?

792
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Kill 'em with thirst,
knife 'em, or blast 'em
with one of these bullets.

793
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It makes a difference?

794
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Only when you miss.

795
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
A luxury I cannot
afford too often.

796
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
What was it?
Shootin'. From the stream,
sounds like.

797
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Who's down there?
The stream?

798
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Mama! Mama!
Get that boy back here!

799
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Cap, who's down there
with Ellen? Anyone?

800
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Let me go!

801
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You wanted water, amigo.
Drink! Drink!

802
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Don't let him go!

803
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Come back here!
Stop that kid!

804
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Come back
here you fools!

805
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
His ma, she's down
there by the stream.

806
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
And so is Bishop,
for all you know.

807
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
That's what he wants
to do. Draw you out,
get you down there.

808
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Now get back in here.

809
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Keep him covered, Ellen.

810
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
If he moves, shoot him!

811
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Mama! Mama!

812
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Don't move!
Let him go.

813
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Coax me.

814
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Give me that rifle.

815
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I warn you.

816
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I said give it to me.

817
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
One more inch
and I kill the boy.

818
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Your rifle, your bullets,
you know what they can do.

819
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Now let him go.
The boy dies!

820
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
So do you.

821
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Will! Will!

822
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Bishop or no,
that woman and
kid's out there!

823
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Stay with the wagons!
Make 'em come to you!

824
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Let me go!

825
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Hey, hey, it's one
of them miners.

826
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Bannon. Down by the stream.

827
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Tried to jump the woman.
I tried to stop him.

828
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And Barrett?
Dead.

829
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Bannon killed him.

830
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
D'ya hear that?

831
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Yankee scum!

832
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Anyone else with him?
No one. He's alone.

833
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Go get him.

834
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Will! He's hurt!

835
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Oww!
His arm's probably broken.

836
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Will, Will.

837
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Be a lot worse if
we don't get out of here.

838
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
What are you doing?

839
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
We've got to get
to those horses.

840
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Yonder's the boy!

841
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
There he is!
He's got the kid!

842
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,000
He's gettin' away!

843
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Shoot him!

844
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
No, no! You'll hit the kid!

845
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Where's Bishop?

846
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Bunk house.

847
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
With Red?

848
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
How is he?

849
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I take the boy.

850
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Careful of that arm,
it may be busted.

851
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
It's a pretty good splint.

852
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Better fix a new one.

853
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
You go with Charley.
He'll take care of Will

854
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
and give you
something to eat.

855
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Thanks.

856
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
We tried it your way,
didn't we?

857
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Now we'll try it mine.

858
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Stark. Chavez.

859
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,000
How many men we
got, Stark?

860
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Fifteen, sixteen.

861
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Where're the others?
Out on the range.

862
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Saddle them up then.
Murray, Hall...

863
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
No, I want Murray
with me.

864
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Sam and Hall stay here
with Charley, the rest go.

865
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
You said three days.

866
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Hear me?
Yes, sir.

867
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Chavez, break out them rifles.
The new ones.

868
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Pass 'em out as far
as they go.
All right.

869
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Look, Hardy, you said three
days. You gave your word,

870
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
that must mean
something.

871
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Not when it cost me
one of my men.

872
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Well, you go up there
bent on killing
and probably lose...

873
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
No handful of settlers
I can take care of.
...lose five or six...

874
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
But it's not a handful,
not anymore it isn't.

875
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
What are you talking about?
You can guess.

876
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Them rustlers?
You're in a war, Hardy.

877
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
A bigger war than you've
ever been in before,

878
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
but it's not
with them settlers.

879
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Yellow-livered,
cattle steal...

880
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
So they're in this too, huh?

881
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
But who you want
is Harper.

882
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Why hanged if it ain't
shaping up into
a pretty fair fight.

883
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Hurry 'em up, Stark.

884
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Look, let me go up
there and tell them they
have to give up Harper.

885
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,000
No, by thunder,
they're part of it!

886
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Made themselves part
when they shot that boy.

887
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
But that was Harper!
It's the same thing.

888
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
They ain't no different.
You think so?

889
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Come in here, I want
to show you something.

890
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
If you gotta yelp,
boy, yelp.

891
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Bust a gut holdin' it in.

892
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Men don't cry.

893
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Oh? I always figured
men do cry.

894
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Real men.

895
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Only the greenhorns
who aren't sure they're men,

896
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
they're the ones that
worry about it.

897
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,000
It hurts.

898
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
What is this?

899
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
The boy's name is Will.
That's his mother, Ellen.

900
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Take a look at
'em Hardy, a good look,
real close.

901
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
No different from Harper
and those cattle thieves,
is that what you said?

902
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
They're on my land.

903
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Is that all you've
got to say?

904
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
They're on my land!
You're land!

905
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
You talk about it like
it was something holy?

906
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
It is for me.

907
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
When are you going
to learn, Hardy.

908
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Without people it's nothing!
People are what make
it worth something.

909
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Aah, don't talk to me
about people.

910
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Ain't one I'd pay
a sack o' sheep dung for.

911
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
You don't believe that.

912
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I built my life believin' it.

913
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Now get these people outta
my sight, and you with 'em.

914
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
So you really mean it.

915
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
You're really gonna go
up there and chop 'em up.

916
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
That's exactly what
I'm going to do.

917
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Well, then you're going to
have to chop me up, too,

918
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
be right up there
with 'em.

919
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
That suits me fine.

920
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Get the boy's clothes.

921
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Why do you hate us?

922
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,000
What did we do wrong?

923
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Will.

924
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Wait!

925
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
You say Harper's the one,
not these people.

926
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
You say he shot Red?

927
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
You can get them
to turn him over to me?

928
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Knowing what I do.

929
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
You can make them leave,
clear off my land,
without no more killing?

930
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I think so.

931
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
What if there is killing?

932
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Then it's your way.

933
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
My way.

934
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I used to know
what that was.

935
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I used to have
a right, clear notion.

936
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Ma'am, the boy could
use some sleep.

937
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Oh, yes, yes, thanks.

938
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
He's so tired.
It's the first real bed
he's slept in in a month.

939
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
You go out for a while.
I'll stay with him until
you turn in.

940
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
You don't have to do that.

941
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Well, he may want something.

942
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I just don't understand...

943
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Ma'am?

944
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Bishop. Giving up
his room like this!

945
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
He seemed so
cruel, so rough.

946
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,000
He's rough.

947
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
So determined
to hate people.

948
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Then to do
a thing like this.

949
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
He don't hate people,
ma'am, not really.

950
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
He's just afraid of
loving 'em, that's all.

951
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
You're a wise man, Charley.

952
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
No ma'am. Just Indian.

953
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Boy all right?

954
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Yes.

955
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Do you think there's
anything you can do?
About Harper, I mean.

956
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Maybe. Not much without
some sleep though.

957
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Good night.

958
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
It was those things you
heard about me back at
the stream, wasn't it?

959
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Forget it. I didn't
believe a word.

960
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
You believed it.
Why shouldn't you?

961
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Most of it was true.

962
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
You don't have to admit
that, not to me.

963
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
I admit it.

964
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
There was a war, people
did a lot of things.

965
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Oh, not the war.

966
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
War made it easy.

967
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
But you lost your husband.

968
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
You said so yourself.
Your home.

969
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,000
There was no home.

970
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,000
And I never had a husband.

971
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
It's not a very pretty
picture, is it?

972
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Neither was the world
I grew up in.

973
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Some people survived it.

974
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
The strong ones, maybe.
But I wasn't strong.
I was weak.

975
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
It's a funny thing
about strength.

976
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I don't think it's something
you're born with.

977
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I'm not even sure
that it's something
you can be taught.

978
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I think it's something you
have to learn for yourself

979
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
through a terrible hurt.

980
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
The boy?

981
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Only not the way you think.

982
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I wanted that baby.

983
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
More than anything
else in the world,
I wanted it.

984
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,000
It was like...

985
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Well, it was like the
only pure thing
I'd ever owned.

986
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
The one thing in my
life that was going
to be clean and...

987
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
Well, that story about my
husband didn't always work.

988
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Sometimes there were people
I'd known before.

989
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And the boy was getting old
enough to be hurt

990
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
by what was being
said about him.

991
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
That's when I got strength.

992
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Enough strength to look
for a new life.

993
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,000
A good life.

994
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Why are you telling me this?

995
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
You don't know,
do you?

996
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Get down!

997
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Gunfire.
It was a gunshot. I heard it.

998
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Keep away from
those windows,

999
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Porter, get away
from that door!

1000
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
He's shot!

1001
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Keep clear of those windows,
all of you!

1002
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Put out that lamp!

1003
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Get the boy.

1004
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Anything?
No.

1005
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Where do you
think they are?

1006
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Firing came from above the
corral. Where's Bishop?

1007
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
The barn.
The others,
the bunkhouse?

1008
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Yeah.

1009
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
That'll be what they're tryin
to cover, then. Here.
Stay where you are.

1010
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Barricade what you can.

1011
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Now son, you stay right
here and don't you move.

1012
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Get it against the door.
Yeah.

1013
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
And get the rifles.

1014
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Man, I can't see nothin'
out there!

1015
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
If it was only out there,
out in the open.

1016
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Well, I ain't about to
wait till it's light,
I can tell ya.

1017
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Not when they can pick me off
like they did Porter.

1018
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I'm with ya,
let's get em.

1019
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Stay where you are.

1020
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Who else is with me?

1021
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
You can count on me.

1022
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
I'm warnin' ya, you won't
get two steps out that door.

1023
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Warnin'? What are you gonna
do, Stark? Shoot us?

1024
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Look, we'll head high, see.
Across the corral.

1025
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
We'll try to make
it to the barn,

1026
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
and when we draw their
fire you come out.

1027
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Come on.

1028
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Sort of been
waiting for you.

1029
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
How did you make it?

1030
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Cut across back
of the bunkhouse.

1031
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
No problems?
One. I think he was
the only one there.

1032
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Sounds like they
got a bunch of 'em.

1033
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
They been workin' over
the bunkhouse,
makin' a coffin out of it.

1034
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
How many you figure?

1035
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Maybe a dozen.
That all?

1036
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
That's all they had unless
they got some of the settlers.

1037
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Yeah, sitting pretty,
ain't they?

1038
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Waiting for us to show
ourselves and pickin' us
off when we do.

1039
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
If only we could think
of a way to get those boys
out of the bunkhouse.

1040
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Well, you better think fast,
it's gonna be light
in a couple o'...

1041
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Hey, wait a minute.

1042
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
You got any water in here?

1043
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
There's a barrel
of it over there. Why?

1044
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Get some straw.

1045
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
What? Straw?

1046
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,000
What for?

1047
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Wet it, and put it
in the wagon.

1048
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
What're you gonna do?
Build a fire.

1049
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Fire? With wet straw?

1050
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Best kind. Ever see one?

1051
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Sure.

1052
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Smokes like the...

1053
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Smokes like the devil.
Come on.

1054
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Still can't see nothin'.
Don't let it gall you, Sam.

1055
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
They can see you.
There is four dead
men to prove it.

1056
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
Well, it's a Mexican standoff
so far, we can't get out,
they can't get it.

1057
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Man, if this works...

1058
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Yeah, you'll never
touch the stuff again.

1059
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Hey, look!

1060
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Somethin' in the barn.
Hanged if it ain't a light.

1061
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
All right, come on!

1062
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Now!

1063
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
The house! Get the house!

1064
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Now!

1065
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Drop 'em!

1066
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Will!

1067
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Will!

1068
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Drop it, Bannon!

1069
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Keep those
hands high!

1070
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Let them go, Harper.

1071
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
It's between you
and me now.

1072
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Not a chance, Bannon.
They're my ticket
out of here.

1073
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Now you get out there
and get a couple of horses and
bring 'em around back, quick.

1074
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Go on, Bannon,
before I...

1075
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Before you what?
Start throwin' more
lead around?

1076
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I've got plenty left.

1077
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
I wonder. Fact is, I wonder
if you've got any left.

1078
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Don't, don't press
me, Bannon.

1079
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I'm not pressin' anything.

1080
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I'm just trying
to figure it.

1081
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I'd be a fool to take orders
from a man with an empty gun,
now wouldn't I?

1082
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Are you going to get
those horses?

1083
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
There's been a lot
of shooting, Harper,
you've done your share.

1084
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Let's see...

1085
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
You shot three times at me,
that leaves three.

1086
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Can you remember 'em?

1087
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
You ought to be able
to remember three shots.

1088
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Charley!

1089
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Ned! Ned, they found Hardy!

1090
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
What do you mean "found"?
In the barn.
You better come quick.

1091
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I'll take care of Charley.

1092
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Take your tamale-pickin'
paws off me.

1093
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Pokin' around in
a man's insides,

1094
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,000
ain't nothing sacred?

1095
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Ah. I got him for ya.

1096
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Pretty ain't he?

1097
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Fancy spurs and all.

1098
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Stop pokin', I told ya.

1099
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
If you really
want to do somethin'
to earn your keep,

1100
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
go get me my whiskey.

1101
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,000
But it is all gone.

1102
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
I know that's empty.

1103
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Look in the feed bin.

1104
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Bring me what
you find there.

1105
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Charley didn't know
about that one.

1106
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
You talk too much.

1107
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Ah, I learned it from you.

1108
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Nothin' but...

1109
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
Nothin' but talk.

1110
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
That's all you were
ever good for.

1111
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
You ought to rest,
Mr. Bishop.

1112
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Man, what a barn-burner.

1113
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Yeah, but we put on
a show for 'em, didn't we?

1114
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Hanged if we didn't.

1115
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Nothing like it since '52.
Right, Stark?

1116
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Yes, sir.

1117
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Here! Gimme that.

1118
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
He's gonna die.

1119
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Die? Me?

1120
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Ha, wouldn't that
be somethin' to see.

1121
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Judson.

1122
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Bannon.

1123
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
We heard about Bishop
gettin' killed.

1124
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,000
We're sorry.
Thanks.

1125
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Where you folks going?
North, to the Humboldt,
then West.

1126
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Like we should've
done in the first place.

1127
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
If we'd listened to you
instead of Harper we'd have
prevented a lot of trouble.

1128
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,000
And killin'.

1129
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Maybe Harper was right
about one thing though.

1130
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Maybe you folks
should stay in this valley,
all of you.

1131
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
I want you to stay.

1132
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
After what we've done?

1133
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,000
All you've done,
any of you, is try and
find a place to belong.

1134
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
I'd like to belong here,
it's a great land.

1135
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:41,000
It's just land now.

1136
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
What it needs is people
to make it great.

1137
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
I hope you'll stay.

1138
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Folks, did you hear what
Mr. Bannon said?

1139
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
He said he wants
us to stay here.

1140
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
She's gone.

1141
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
She and the boy.

1142
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Where?
Up North. Toward
the Humboldt, I guess.

1143
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Thanks.
