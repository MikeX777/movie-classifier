00:00:01,007 --> 00:00:04,007
Mizizi Chronicles

2
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,398
I'm all set here

3
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:06,743
Let's roll

4
00:02:08,245 --> 00:02:09,212
Action

5
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:30,523
Hello. I'm Raj Jaiswal.
Welcome to British Raj.

6
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:33,626
Before we move on to
our next assignment,

7
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:38,508
let's meet our new co-anchor
the sexy, sultry Dilnaaz Bagga.

8
00:02:39,176 --> 00:02:42,202
Hi Dilnaaz.
- Hi Raj. Hi everybody.

9
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,411
You know, today is very lucky
for Dilnaaz.

10
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:49,449
Not because it's her first day on the
show, but because I am introducing her.

11
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:53,382
It's a joke. It's a joke, darling.
You can smile.

12
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,317
First on the show, you see.
So tell me, Dilnaaz,

13
00:02:56,694 --> 00:02:58,389
you have a boy friend?

14
00:03:00,364 --> 00:03:03,265
That's not in this...
- Someone you date. I know that.

15
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:08,671
C'mon, don't be shy.
It's British Raj. Tell us!

16
00:03:09,073 --> 00:03:12,509
There must be someone for whom
you are willing to cross all limits.

17
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:17,411
Actually... it depends.

18
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,343
Depends? Really?

19
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:22,618
For him, will you spend
three hours of your life...

20
00:03:23,053 --> 00:03:26,352
on a movie that's beyond
your comprehension?

21
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:31,687
Yes, of course.
- Will you do it everyday for a year?

22
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:34,164
I mean, will you do it for 365 days?

23
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:36,359
Everyday? A year?

24
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:37,701
Yes, everyday.

25
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,128
Today we are going to meet
a warm Englishman...

26
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:45,738
who has spent 1095 hours on
Hindi films for the sake of his love.

27
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:50,406
Our correspondent Akshay Kapoor
is very anxious...

28
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:54,047
outside the Baker Street police station
to show you this exclusive.

29
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,975
Over to you, Akshay.

30
00:03:59,356 --> 00:04:03,292
Hello Raj. I'm standing in front of
the Baker Street police station,

31
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:08,657
looking for an unusual lover.
God knows why he is hiding from us.

32
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,656
Let's find him.

33
00:04:11,135 --> 00:04:14,002
Officer, be gentle.
Follow me.

34
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:18,063
In relation, I am your father.

35
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:22,510
The name is John Smith.

36
00:04:23,747 --> 00:04:28,184
By my mother I swear, I will
pick each one of you and kill you!

37
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:34,582
This is Inspector John Smith. His Hindi
tutors include the famous writers...

38
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:40,053
of the Hindi film industry
like Javed Akhtar and K K Shukla.

39
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:44,633
Inspector, what inspired you
to learn Hindi?

40
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:48,536
I fell in love.
- Wonderful. What was her name?

41
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:51,240
Ina, Meena, Dika, Anju or Manju?

42
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:55,302
Monica! O my darling!

43
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:59,649
So Inspector, how did your
small love story begin?

44
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,315
Would you come with me
for the late night show?

45
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,523
She worked for Symphony Theatre.
Ticket window, you know.

46
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:12,655
I used to buy tickets
to catch a glimpse of her.

47
00:05:13,297 --> 00:05:15,265
Eventually ended up watching movies.

48
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:19,558
In one year I learnt fluent Hindi.
And I proposed to her.

49
00:05:20,037 --> 00:05:22,267
Lovers take the brides away.

50
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:26,134
Then a quick wedding followed by kids.
That's it.

51
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:30,538
So that was Inspector John Smith's
interesting filmy love-story.

52
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:33,539
Akshay Kapoor for British Raj.

53
00:05:34,051 --> 00:05:35,245
Thank you, Akshay.

54
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:38,483
How do you find the Bollywood type
love-story of Inspector Smith?

55
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:40,517
Do email us.
- That's all.

56
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:44,159
That's all on British Raj today.
Whether you want it or not,

57
00:05:44,461 --> 00:05:47,692
we will be back tomorrow, same place,
same time. Love you London.

58
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:49,356
Bye.
- Wonderful.

59
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:51,724
Great show. That's it.

60
00:05:52,703 --> 00:05:55,297
10 pm?
- Sorry.

61
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:58,435
You and I, dinner? Together?

62
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,204
But Raj...
- I know, you can't believe it, right?

63
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:06,975
But your beauty has the right
to go out for dinner with me.

64
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:10,111
Dinner?
- I know.

65
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:14,548
Only dinner can't fill your stomach.
You can wait till breakfast if you wish.

66
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,288
I like my eggs boiled.
Don't be late. Okay?

67
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,396
Raj...
- Yes darling?

68
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:27,694
Work, work, work! You look good.
- Sure

69
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:33,576
Rubina, my love, your husband is
treating you well?

70
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:37,309
Stop it.
- What about you? I'll ring you soon

71
00:06:40,217 --> 00:06:41,411
Kathy, my love

72
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:44,687
Looks like you're losing some weight.
Smashing

73
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,592
"Early morning,"

74
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,458
"what's come over me?"

75
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,000
"I don't know why
I'm walking on air"

76
00:07:36,573 --> 00:07:38,131
"New morning,"

77
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,635
"new place,"

78
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:46,614
"new directions,
new paths,"

79
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,185
"I tread"

80
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:55,189
"Is it that I've gotten
a new perspective?"

81
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:58,253
"Or, were the sights unseen before?"

82
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:03,360
"Or is it that I'm walking
in a dream?"

83
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:08,102
"Early morning,
what's come over me?"

84
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:12,675
"I don't know why
I'm walking on air"

85
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:17,412
"New morning,"

86
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:19,339
"new place,"

87
00:08:19,683 --> 00:08:22,550
"with new perspective,
new sights..."

88
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,988
"I see"

89
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:31,188
"In this humming ambience..."

90
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:33,663
"and smiling beauty,"

91
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:39,592
"I walk with the world"

92
00:08:41,238 --> 00:08:44,401
"Early morning,
what's come over me?"

93
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:50,173
"I don't know why
I'm walking on air"

94
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,143
"Live the moment"

95
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,453
"If you live, you win,"

96
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,426
"and that's an intoxication"

97
00:09:38,795 --> 00:09:42,253
"Tomorrow is a new intoxication..."

98
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,692
"that's worth living for"

99
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,630
"Drink up the wine of every moment..."

100
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,606
"and fill your heart"

101
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,682
"Early morning,
what's come over me?"

102
00:11:09,052 --> 00:11:13,648
"I don't know why
I'm walking on air"

103
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,026
"New morning, new place,"

104
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,631
"new directions,
new paths,"

105
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:25,531
"I tread"

106
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:31,198
"In this humming ambience..."

107
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,336
"and smiling beauty,"

108
00:11:35,245 --> 00:11:39,181
"I walk with the world"

109
00:12:32,135 --> 00:12:36,196
Hey, who are you?
Hey, you on my balcony. Hey you!

110
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,310
Yes, you

111
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:47,677
Are you talking to me?

112
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:50,686
No, I talking to my favourite painting.
Of course, I'm talking to you.

113
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:53,122
Who are you? How did you
come inside my house?

114
00:12:53,757 --> 00:12:57,158
You can see me? Listen to me?
Wow! That's fantastic.

115
00:12:57,627 --> 00:13:00,596
Yes, I can see you, listen to you and
do many things. But not tonight. You...

116
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:02,122
Touch me

117
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,229
Two minutes haven't passed since we met
and you are asking me to touch you?

118
00:13:07,604 --> 00:13:10,539
Can you feel this?
- Yes, I can feel this.

119
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,669
But right now I can feel you getting
out of my house. Who are you?

120
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:15,338
Shivani

121
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,140
Shivani or Akashwani,
please leave my house.

122
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:21,417
This is my house.
- Really?

123
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:26,483
Let's do something. Come, let me
leave you back at the hospital.

124
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,487
How did you know I came
from the hospital?

125
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:34,095
Your words clearly say that you've
run away from a mental asylum. Besides,

126
00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:36,689
How did you enter my house?

127
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,225
You stole Mr Bolting's keys?
Come on, give me the keys.

128
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,368
I don't need any keys.
- Then how did you enter?

129
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,106
Came flying?
- Listen,

130
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:49,740
just give me five minutes of
your time. My story is very strange.

131
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,272
But if you listen carefully,
you might trust me.

132
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,378
And at this point of time,
your trust is imperative for me.

133
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,384
Why this favour on me? You don't have a
husband, boyfriend or a brain surgeon...

134
00:13:59,689 --> 00:14:03,386
who'd listen to your rubbish?
- No. Because no one can see me.

135
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,059
Except you.
- What is this nonsense?

136
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:08,554
Would you like to listen to my story?
- Pardon?

137
00:14:09,032 --> 00:14:09,999
Please

138
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:13,703
Will you go away if I listen to you?
- You were right.

139
00:14:14,204 --> 00:14:16,604
I've come from the hospital.
- I know that.

140
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,668
I'm a doctor. I met with
an accident six months back.

141
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:22,101
How many did you kill?

142
00:14:31,054 --> 00:14:32,681
Ever since, I've been in coma.

143
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:36,025
My body is in room number 303
of Thomwell Hospital.

144
00:14:39,729 --> 00:14:40,696
Finished?

145
00:14:43,066 --> 00:14:45,432
So you are a spirit? A spirit.

146
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,636
Well beautiful spirit, if you have
more friends, get them over tomorrow.

147
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:52,734
I don't have time today.

148
00:14:53,243 --> 00:14:56,371
Now cut the crap.
Akshay sent you, right?

149
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,647
Akshay, who?

150
00:14:59,683 --> 00:15:01,412
You will know soon. Come on.

151
00:15:02,686 --> 00:15:05,985
I was kidding. Weren't you watching me?
I was laughing all the way.

152
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:11,585
Of course... I'm not serious either.
I'm also laughing away right now.

153
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:13,628
Hang on. Hello?
- Who is it?

154
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:14,997
Raj

155
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:17,995
What am I doing? As usual at this hour,
- Doing what?

156
00:15:18,234 --> 00:15:21,294
Getting beaten up by my wife.
- And why so? Tell him.

157
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,004
You'll kill me!

158
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:27,404
Hello AK. Your friend Shivani
is sitting right before me.

159
00:15:28,044 --> 00:15:32,572
She says she is in a coma. You have
only 30 seconds to end this farce.

160
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,340
Coming up is Shivani for you.

161
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:38,018
Shivani, your time starts now.

162
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:40,620
Hello?
- I can't take the phone.

163
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:43,025
I can't pick up things.

164
00:15:44,561 --> 00:15:46,688
Did you hear?
- What did I hear?

165
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,098
She can't pick up things.
- Who can't pick up what?

166
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,767
Okay

167
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,467
Can you hear now?
- I could hear then too.

168
00:15:55,739 --> 00:15:58,435
But I couldn't figure anything.
My ears are ringing.

169
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:02,101
Come on AK, I know you are trying
to pull a fast one on me.

170
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:05,609
And you know I'm not going
to be fooled. Please speak and get out.

171
00:16:06,016 --> 00:16:10,248
Hello? Hi Akshay.
I know you cannot hear me

172
00:16:11,021 --> 00:16:12,989
But your friend doesn't believe me.

173
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:17,487
AK, answer her.
- Who spoke? What should I answer?

174
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:21,388
Hey AK, dude, this is
really bad timing.

175
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:24,565
Dilnaaz will be here in five minutes,
- I'm going through bad times!

176
00:16:25,035 --> 00:16:27,196
My house is being vandalized.
Can you hear?

177
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:34,767
Raj, if I don't hang up, I will be
martyred in my prime. Bye Raj.

178
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:37,771
Bye?
- Kuljeet. Relax please.

179
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:40,683
Fine

180
00:16:43,053 --> 00:16:45,283
Which hospital?
- Thomwell Hospital.

181
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,354
Is there a ward for lunatics too?
- Shivani Dutt, room number 303

182
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:50,659
Right

183
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:54,790
Come on, let's go.
- Really? You will go with me?

184
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,429
If not, how will I throw you out?
- Will you go just like this?

185
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:00,669
Then how do I go?
- Put some clothes on.

186
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:05,304
Go as my cousin. Tell them you have
to meet me tonight itself,

187
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:09,569
since you got a flight in the morning.
Simple, easy and it always works.

188
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:13,374
Absolutely not. We follow rules here.

189
00:17:14,717 --> 00:17:16,685
But ma'am, I was just wondering...
- Aren't you an Indian?

190
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:19,417
Yes.
- Does it hurt if you speak in Hindi?

191
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:30,989
Ms Nurse, you are an Indian. You know
the pain of separation from dear ones.

192
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:35,296
I've come from India
only to meet her.

193
00:17:36,773 --> 00:17:38,468
You are like my mother.

194
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:44,310
Can't a mother breach a small rule
of this huge hospital for her son?

195
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:49,009
Only 15 minutes.
And don't touch anything!

196
00:17:51,054 --> 00:17:53,022
Come.
- Let's go

197
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,125
Trapped

198
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:05,397
Look, she is in a coma.
She can hear what you say.

199
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:08,968
Don't overact
like you did in the lobby.

200
00:18:09,606 --> 00:18:12,973
Take it easy.
And don't touch any thing! Okay?

201
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:14,608
Yes
- Have I made myself clear?

202
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,638
Very.
- Okay

203
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,133
Twin sister?

204
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,210
Mind-blowing!
Whose idea was it?

205
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,017
Mr Raj, it's me.
Neither alive nor dead.

206
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,418
Whoever you are,
why are you dragging me into it?

207
00:18:58,688 --> 00:19:01,282
Don't know. Maybe a relationship
of a previous birth.

208
00:19:01,691 --> 00:19:07,027
Pardon? Previous birth? At least you
should've got your lines written well.

209
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,363
But it's not your fault, you are
just an actress. Okay guys,

210
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,533
out with the cameras. I'm not going
to be a scapegoat. AK, show up

211
00:19:14,003 --> 00:19:17,166
Listen Raj, I've told you!
No AKs or cameras here

212
00:19:17,707 --> 00:19:19,106
Only I am here.
- You are right

213
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,570
And here's my body that's stepping
towards death everyday.

214
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:24,639
That's really sad.
- Why don't you trust me?

215
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:27,616
How should I explain? What do I do?

216
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:30,449
Do whatever you have to.
I am going home. Okay?

217
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:31,742
What happened?

218
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:34,417
Who are you talking to?

219
00:19:38,061 --> 00:19:40,427
So you are also in league?
- With whom?

220
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:42,656
With her

221
00:19:43,032 --> 00:19:45,523
With whom?
- With her?

222
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:49,205
With whom?
- With her

223
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:02,718
Tell me

224
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:16,691
It seems you love her very much.
She is loveable.

225
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,033
All of us in the hospital
love her dearly.

226
00:20:20,336 --> 00:20:22,702
If you wish you can sit
for some more time.

227
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:47,057
Insolent

228
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:21,490
Relax Inspector Smith.
It's absolutely normal.

229
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:25,623
It happens with coma patients. If she
opens her eyes it doesn't mean...

230
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:29,230
she is conscious.
She still is in a coma.

231
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:36,042
Look, this is her cerebral cortex
which is severely damaged. Have a look.

232
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:43,047
She is lucky, her brain stem is fine,
because of which there are movements.

233
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,553
She can open her eyes, but
she cannot see anything.

234
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:51,318
She cannot think or feel anything.

235
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:55,389
How long, doctor?
- Can't say

236
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:58,792
A month, a year, maybe all her life.

237
00:22:00,136 --> 00:22:03,003
No hopes of her getting well,
Inspector.

238
00:22:07,543 --> 00:22:10,239
The world live on hopes, doctor.

239
00:23:20,283 --> 00:23:21,250
Hi

240
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:26,646
One shot from here.
- See you later.

241
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:28,023
See you

242
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:32,026
Lip stick please.
- Hi

243
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:34,418
Good morning

244
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:40,464
Dilnaaz, last night...
- You were about to ruin my life!

245
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:44,262
3idane's head wouldn't have hurt
so much. Aren't you ashamed?

246
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:47,633
You call up a married man at night
and ask him to talk to a girl.

247
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,135
And you don't even let her talk!
- I called you last night?

248
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,814
Akshay, get out of here. I'm ready
to roll. Pass the papers, baby.

249
00:24:00,623 --> 00:24:03,558
Action.
- Hello and welcome to British Raj.

250
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:07,587
Today's top story;
From Spark To Fire.

251
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:14,401
An 18-year-old girl, in a fit of rage,
torched her boyfriend's brand new Porche.

252
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:17,570
Why did she do it?
Good question.

253
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,568
Because her boyfriend dared to come
four hours late.

254
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:27,538
What do you think, Raj?
Did Pooja do the right thing?

255
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,018
Or was she overreacting?

256
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,452
Well, you know...
- Don't you think that...

257
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,621
he got a mild punishment?
I mean,

258
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,686
don't you think she should've
set her boyfriend afire?

259
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:41,095
Pardon?
- That's not in script.

260
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:45,697
What does he think of himself?
To make a girl wait for hours alone...

261
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:51,196
in a restaurant,
is that decency?

262
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:54,042
I'm sorry.
- It's disgusting.

263
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:58,474
I say, he should be castrated,
not set afire.

264
00:24:58,781 --> 00:24:59,748
Ouch

265
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:03,679
Now come on, Dilnaaz.
It's a family audience.

266
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:05,980
It happens sometimes.

267
00:25:07,023 --> 00:25:09,753
Your boyfriend... I mean, Pooja's
boyfriend must've been helpless,

268
00:25:10,226 --> 00:25:13,627
held up with some problem.
- Problem?

269
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,798
What kind of problem, Raj?

270
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:19,394
Come on, it happens...

271
00:25:20,202 --> 00:25:20,998
You?

272
00:25:21,304 --> 00:25:22,236
Hello.

273
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:25,133
I?
- Who are you?

274
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:26,642
Wow!

275
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,435
So who am I now?
- Okay, cut it out, guys.

276
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:34,238
This is too much. I told you, I'm not
going to be fooled. C'mon, out with it.

277
00:25:35,518 --> 00:25:37,213
Who sent the girl to my house?

278
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:41,615
I see. So there was a girl
with you last night.

279
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:44,026
Yes... I mean no...
- That was your problem.

280
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:49,028
Hey, stop right there!
Don't come in front you camera.

281
00:25:55,404 --> 00:25:57,463
What's wrong with him?
He doesn't do drugs.

282
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:00,609
Don't block...

283
00:26:03,713 --> 00:26:05,578
Ghost!
- Ghost?

284
00:26:06,048 --> 00:26:08,016
Am I?
- What is he saying?

285
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:09,979
You don't want to know!
- Look Raj,

286
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,682
I didn't fall for you,
you were behind me.

287
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,315
Oh my god! You are really a ghost.

288
00:26:16,692 --> 00:26:18,660
No, technically I'm not a ghost.
- How dare you?

289
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:22,358
Because I'm not dead yet. Why did
you run away from the hospital?

290
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:26,998
You are trouble, I have to run.
- Trouble? I am trouble?

291
00:26:28,037 --> 00:26:30,562
Mr Raj Jaiswal, this is a bit much.

292
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,406
Not you, Dilnaaz.
- Relax, Raj.

293
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:37,240
So this is Dilnaaz? What's great
about her? She is so ordinary.

294
00:26:37,747 --> 00:26:40,238
Have you seen your face?
You are worse than ordinary.

295
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:41,683
Really?
- No, no...

296
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:45,609
Then why did you invite me
for dinner last night?

297
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:49,680
You were supposed to dine with her?
Are you nuts? I am better company.

298
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,628
Dinner with you? I'm not nuts.

299
00:26:54,063 --> 00:26:55,030
That's it!
- Oh no!

300
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,563
I've had enough. I won't work
with this filthy man.

301
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,561
Just roll, baby.
This is reality TV.

302
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:05,667
I won't keep mum.
I will sue you for sexual harassment.

303
00:27:07,009 --> 00:27:09,671
Ghost!
- I'll take this channel to court.

304
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,682
Hey, that's not Ms Creative.

305
00:27:14,417 --> 00:27:15,384
Pack up

306
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,757
Ghost

307
00:27:27,029 --> 00:27:29,429
No, it's not possible. Please go away.
- Raj, listen to me Raj

308
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,495
Raj, listen to me.
- I don't want to hear you.

309
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:34,702
Please go away. Why are you after me?
Please leave me.

310
00:27:36,205 --> 00:27:38,673
Excuse me.
- What did you say?

311
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,643
Raj, what's wrong with you?

312
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:47,408
Nothing. What's wrong with me?
I'm just a bit tired.

313
00:27:48,551 --> 00:27:52,009
I'm not mad.
- I didn't say you are mad.

314
00:27:52,788 --> 00:27:55,348
But everyone there thinks I am.
- All right, let me come in.

315
00:27:55,658 --> 00:27:57,558
Don't! Or you'll regret

316
00:28:02,732 --> 00:28:03,699
Why?

317
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:09,664
There's a ghost in the lift.
- There's a ghost in the lift?

318
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:14,265
Raj! Listen to me.

319
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:16,670
Why didn't you allow him to come in?
- I can't hear you, I can't see you. No.

320
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:20,445
I can't see anything. It is not true!
- Why are you running away from me?

321
00:28:21,717 --> 00:28:24,117
Lord, save me.

322
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:26,284
Raj, listen to me.

323
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:28,387
Listen to me.

324
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,990
Will you listen to me, Raj?

325
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:36,224
Come on, Raj!
Take her away from me, Lord.

326
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:37,998
I told you...

327
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:41,999
I'm not a ghost.

328
00:28:45,374 --> 00:28:46,602
Go away.
You don't exist.

329
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:49,010
lt'll be bright sunshine
in Stockholm today.

330
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,614
It's not happening to me.

331
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,523
Where are you going?
- Wherever you go.

332
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,291
No, no.

333
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,961
Please... please come out... come out.

334
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:19,775
Please

335
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:35,115
Calm down... you are in control.

336
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:50,664
Hello?

337
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,270
Raj stop talking to yourself.

338
00:29:54,076 --> 00:29:55,668
AK, I'm not talking to myself.

339
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,672
Wait there,
I need to talk to you.

340
00:29:58,113 --> 00:30:00,138
No.
- I'll come and tell you. Wait!

341
00:30:00,749 --> 00:30:01,716
No!

342
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,028
Move

343
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,031
Why?
- You mind if I drive the car?

344
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:21,400
Are we talking? Or going on a drive?
- We'll talk while driving.

345
00:30:21,704 --> 00:30:25,401
AK, you're entering at your own risk.
- Yes, I know.

346
00:30:25,774 --> 00:30:27,435
You know nothing.

347
00:30:40,322 --> 00:30:44,520
Hello, excuse me...
I'm not your driver.

348
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:48,662
Will you come and sit in the front?
- I can't sit in the front.

349
00:30:49,164 --> 00:30:52,531
I forget. The ghost is sitting
in the car.

350
00:30:53,736 --> 00:30:55,704
She-ghost!
- Of course.

351
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:58,469
If you have a problem,
there surely has to be a girl.

352
00:30:58,741 --> 00:31:02,199
And right now
she is sitting beside you.

353
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,011
No AK, she is sitting beside you.

354
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,075
Right here?

355
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,318
She is hot.

356
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:19,285
You have a great tuning
with the ghost.

357
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:24,597
Tell her to go and sit behind,
so that you can come forward.

358
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,069
Sit please.

359
00:31:29,872 --> 00:31:31,430
Please.
- What?

360
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:33,108
Of course

361
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:48,790
What?

362
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:51,525
Shall we?
- Let's go.

363
00:32:09,044 --> 00:32:11,638
Look, there's no need to
tell him the truth.

364
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:14,615
He is my best friend,
I can't lie to him.

365
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,486
Why not, bro? When you can talk
to nobody, why can't you lie to me?

366
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:22,484
I'm not talking to nobody, AK.
She is sitting behind us.

367
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:31,189
Why don't you tell the ghost to get off
and leave us alone for a few minutes?

368
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:35,697
I wish to talk to you. Until then
tell her to go to a graveyard and sing.

369
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,677
Gone?

370
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,042
Gone.
- Where?

371
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:50,608
You are a genius. Why didn't you
say that before?

372
00:32:53,155 --> 00:32:55,646
What's up with you?
- What's up with me?

373
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:58,653
AK, please understand.

374
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:14,434
You don't believe me, right?
- Well... I do.

375
00:33:14,777 --> 00:33:17,405
Last night, after you took a bath,
you met a girl.

376
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:22,412
She was with you the whole night.
- Not together, but yes...

377
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:26,152
Away. Because she wasn't a girl,
she was a ghost.

378
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:29,149
Not the spooky movie types...
- Beautiful ghost.

379
00:33:30,726 --> 00:33:35,220
Very good. She also says that she is
not a ghost and she is alive.

380
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:39,393
She is comatose.
- Yes, correct. No one can see her,

381
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,100
except you. Very good.

382
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:51,203
At least it will take two years
in the mental asylum.

383
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,079
AK, cut it out! I'm not mad.
I have seen her body with my own eyes.

384
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:59,217
Every mad man says that...
- I'm not mad, I am not mad.

385
00:33:59,555 --> 00:34:00,522
Exactly

386
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:08,655
You are right. I need to rest.

387
00:34:09,698 --> 00:34:12,599
Let me drop you back at the office.

388
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:15,668
You are right, you badly need rest.

389
00:34:16,105 --> 00:34:19,165
Go home and take rest, I'll take care
of the office. Don't worry about me.

390
00:34:21,677 --> 00:34:24,202
See you.
- Yes. But don't see anybody else,

391
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:26,174
I'll get jealous.

392
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:05,578
Know what? I met Mrs Khanna
before coming here.

393
00:35:06,054 --> 00:35:11,287
That gossip-monger Mrs Khanna.
She was asking about your health

394
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:14,993
I said, fine. She will come home
in some days.

395
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:21,992
I don't know why she laughed at me,
as if I was lying.

396
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:26,201
That was it. I walked away in a rage.

397
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:31,236
Oh God! Shivani, don't be upset now.
I'm telling you,

398
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,209
you'll be absolutely fine.
Turn that side.

399
00:35:35,784 --> 00:35:37,342
Good girl

400
00:35:39,087 --> 00:35:43,285
D'you know what is the greatest
strength of human beings?

401
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,224
Faith.

402
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:50,255
Everytime I see you,
my faith gets stronger.

403
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:56,630
I know, you will come back.
You have to, my child!

404
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,994
I can feel you too.
- Feel what?

405
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,657
Oh no, not you, ma'am...
- I'll send Bob.

406
00:36:24,132 --> 00:36:26,225
And I'll see if you can feel him too.

407
00:36:32,341 --> 00:36:35,640
If it goes on like this,
I'll be hauled in.

408
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:38,635
Do you believe me now?
- Is this possible?

409
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:42,309
Possible? It is happening, Raj
You still have doubts?

410
00:36:44,753 --> 00:36:49,019
Hi. Can I have a coffee
and some scrambled eggs please?

411
00:36:49,658 --> 00:36:51,353
Sure, whatever you want.

412
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,029
Yes, it's happening. But why?

413
00:36:55,998 --> 00:37:01,129
You... in the hospital... in my house
...why in my life?

414
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:04,529
I don't know.
I know only my story.

415
00:37:05,007 --> 00:37:06,599
But why in my life?

416
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,611
Do you have a phone?
- Why? You want to make a call?

417
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,141
Take out your phone and talk.

418
00:37:19,688 --> 00:37:20,655
Thank you.

419
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:27,591
Hello? So tell me
your suspense thriller.

420
00:37:29,298 --> 00:37:32,699
Just one condition. Use your heart,
not your mind, to listen.

421
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,667
After the accident when I came to,
I found myself in this weird state.

422
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:46,007
Since I'm an doctor, I couldn't
believe such things could happen.

423
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:52,013
It scared me, but the sight
of my mom would give me hope.

424
00:37:54,056 --> 00:37:57,514
I stepped out of the hospital
with that hope...

425
00:37:59,728 --> 00:38:01,423
And went to see mom.

426
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,961
I found that she too was losing hope.

427
00:38:07,002 --> 00:38:08,970
I couldn't see her sorrow.

428
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,468
For days I just wandered.

429
00:38:12,641 --> 00:38:15,974
Among the crowd, alone, troubled.

430
00:38:25,253 --> 00:38:27,983
Finally, in search of peace,
I decided to go home...

431
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:32,421
your house, now. I was thinking that
there's no end to my woes.

432
00:38:32,828 --> 00:38:34,318
And last night...

433
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,997
I met you. You can see me,

434
00:38:37,265 --> 00:38:40,598
I can feel you, listen to you, blah
blah blah. All right, I'll help you.

435
00:38:41,036 --> 00:38:42,003
Really?

436
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:46,037
Why?
- You think...

437
00:38:46,341 --> 00:38:51,210
I lent you a ear to pass time?
I don't do things if I see no profit

438
00:38:52,047 --> 00:38:56,450
And from you, I stand to gain a lot.
Come on, follow me.

439
00:39:00,689 --> 00:39:03,351
Shivani, there are three girls
behind you.

440
00:39:04,693 --> 00:39:07,253
I like all of them. Find out
if I stand a chance.

441
00:39:07,796 --> 00:39:09,286
Are you crazy?

442
00:39:10,532 --> 00:39:11,499
What?

443
00:39:13,702 --> 00:39:15,567
Go. You don't have a choice.

444
00:39:26,014 --> 00:39:27,675
I think he's really cute.

445
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:35,588
Tell me, what were they
saying about me?

446
00:39:36,024 --> 00:39:38,288
Forget it.
- Why forget it?

447
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,323
Forget it.
- Why?

448
00:39:42,197 --> 00:39:45,655
No chance, Raj.
- What were they saying about me?

449
00:39:47,035 --> 00:39:48,696
That...
- What?

450
00:39:50,038 --> 00:39:52,632
She said, you came alone
to the bar.

451
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:55,042
So?

452
00:39:56,578 --> 00:39:59,672
Your clothes...
- Clothes? What about my clothes?

453
00:40:00,282 --> 00:40:02,580
They're strange.
- Strange?

454
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:06,621
You know, they think you are...

455
00:40:07,355 --> 00:40:09,653
I am?
- Gay.

456
00:40:16,064 --> 00:40:19,124
I told you, this bar is a bad one.
Let's go.

457
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:15,017
No use being your friend.
Go back to wherever you've come from.

458
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:18,486
Why do you look at life like this?
- Because in our world,

459
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:22,593
this is how we look at life.
Do whatever you have to in your world.

460
00:41:23,131 --> 00:41:25,463
Tell me, don't you use
this road everyday?

461
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:28,235
Yes.
- How many times till now?

462
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:30,499
Why?
- Just asking.

463
00:41:32,207 --> 00:41:36,439
Might be a 50,000 times. Happy?
- What do you like the most here?

464
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:39,538
Are you interviewing me?
- Come on, Raj.

465
00:41:39,881 --> 00:41:41,473
Many things...
- Like?

466
00:41:41,783 --> 00:41:45,446
Like... like these apples.
Even the queen of England...

467
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:49,383
buys her apples from here.
And yes the coffee shop,

468
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:53,489
whose Jamaican brew is very special
And Marques Potter,

469
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:56,559
where Akshay and I used to
have a drink everyday.

470
00:41:57,032 --> 00:42:01,628
Also that restaurant whose food is
tasteless but waitresses very pretty

471
00:42:03,805 --> 00:42:06,569
What's so funny?
- Want to see from my perspective?

472
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:07,667
No.

473
00:42:08,143 --> 00:42:09,075
Please

474
00:42:09,844 --> 00:42:10,811
Please

475
00:42:11,746 --> 00:42:13,646
Okay.
- Got a handkerchief?

476
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:17,016
Yes. Why?
- Blindfold yourself

477
00:42:19,721 --> 00:42:24,715
Not myself, I like to blindfold others.
And that too at my home, not here.

478
00:42:27,862 --> 00:42:31,025
Don't get excited, Raj.
Come on, trust me.

479
00:42:33,068 --> 00:42:34,797
Okay.
- Trust me.

480
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:43,644
You won't throw me
in front of a bus, will you?

481
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:45,746
No

482
00:42:48,216 --> 00:42:49,183
Come on

483
00:42:50,619 --> 00:42:52,610
Concentrate. Can you hear
the tweeting of the bird?

484
00:42:53,088 --> 00:42:55,579
It's in a cage. Must be calling out to
its beloved who was separated.

485
00:42:56,057 --> 00:42:57,490
What do you think?

486
00:42:57,726 --> 00:43:01,594
There's a beggar outside your favourite
bar. Everyone thinks he is blind.

487
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:04,999
You also give him money. But he's not
really blind. He's acting.

488
00:43:07,235 --> 00:43:10,602
And your Queen of England's favourite
apple-seller, who's quite famous,

489
00:43:11,206 --> 00:43:13,606
his apples look more fresh and red.
But no one knows that...

490
00:43:14,042 --> 00:43:18,001
he uses a spray that makes the apples
shine more. Don't buy from him again.

491
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,408
And this is Michelle,
the florist with a smile.

492
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,651
But she's hurt from inside,

493
00:43:25,053 --> 00:43:27,647
Because her son has gone for war
in Afghanistan. It's been years,

494
00:43:28,156 --> 00:43:32,616
and he has not returned yet. Michelle's
world has stopped on that turn.

495
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:39,523
And this place is called The Lamp
Of Love. You must've heard about it.

496
00:43:40,068 --> 00:43:43,299
Lovers who kiss under this lamp post
stay together forever, they say.

497
00:43:43,772 --> 00:43:45,433
But why'd you care?

498
00:44:07,696 --> 00:44:11,598
Do you see something here too,
that I can't? Am I missing something?

499
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:13,701
Your Phone.

500
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:17,400
Take out your phone and talk
- Why?

501
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,003
People will call you mad.
- But I'm not mad, right?

502
00:44:22,043 --> 00:44:24,307
Let people call what they want,

503
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:26,338
I don't care.
- Really?

504
00:45:10,225 --> 00:45:13,160
"Whatever people wish to say,"

505
00:45:14,028 --> 00:45:15,393
"let them say"

506
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:20,327
"Whatever happens,"

507
00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:22,998
"let it happen"

508
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:29,237
"Why should the world bother
if a heart..."

509
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:33,012
"meet another here?"

510
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:39,213
"Whoever wants to say anything,"

511
00:45:40,755 --> 00:45:42,620
"let them say"

512
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,155
"Just don't bother"

513
00:46:53,628 --> 00:46:55,960
"No, no..."

514
00:46:57,198 --> 00:46:59,666
"don't be afraid
of the world anymore,"

515
00:47:00,168 --> 00:47:01,965
"don't hide anything"

516
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:06,470
"Whatever it is, it is the truth,
don't you hide from the world"

517
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:12,638
"Please come,
for a moment..."

518
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:15,080
"please sit"

519
00:47:17,552 --> 00:47:21,989
"The feelings in your heart,
pour them out"

520
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:27,159
"Why should we be afraid?"

521
00:47:27,528 --> 00:47:31,624
"If anyone thinks we are crazy,
O ignorant one?"

522
00:47:35,837 --> 00:47:38,499
"Whatever we want to do,"

523
00:47:40,742 --> 00:47:42,607
"let's do"

524
00:47:43,344 --> 00:47:45,278
"Let the others freak out"

525
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:50,016
"Whatever they wish to say,
let the people..."

526
00:47:50,752 --> 00:47:51,719
"say"

527
00:47:54,355 --> 00:47:57,347
"They will say it and forget,"

528
00:47:57,992 --> 00:47:59,960
"just think"

529
00:48:01,696 --> 00:48:05,564
"So why should I change for them?"

530
00:48:06,067 --> 00:48:09,525
"He who doesn't understand
changes"

531
00:48:12,707 --> 00:48:15,972
"Whoever cares for the world,"

532
00:48:17,412 --> 00:48:19,676
"let him care"

533
00:48:20,181 --> 00:48:22,445
"Let him change"

534
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:12,499
Did we do anything wrong
last night, Shivani?

535
00:49:14,002 --> 00:49:15,560
Why, what happened?
- Forget it, Raj.

536
00:49:16,004 --> 00:49:19,531
You look innocent while sleeping.
- I'm extremely sorry to disappoint you.

537
00:49:20,008 --> 00:49:22,306
But now that I'm up,
I've got lots to do.

538
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:25,171
I have to put your spirit back
into your body.

539
00:49:25,747 --> 00:49:30,207
And I really don't appreciate you
watching me while sleeping.

540
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,458
Coffee, sweetheart.
- No.

541
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:49,499
Raj, it's not your cup of tea.
It's a waste of time.

542
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:52,695
Really? Do you have a better idea?

543
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:56,676
You entered my house,
got me into this mess...

544
00:49:57,178 --> 00:49:59,146
and now you say it's a waste of time.

545
00:50:00,615 --> 00:50:02,412
Women! What do you want me to do?

546
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:07,388
Excuse me.

547
00:50:09,123 --> 00:50:12,024
Trust me, have the coffee,
take a bath and feel fresh.

548
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,357
I am the ghost, not you.

549
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:19,689
I've told you before! You are
not a ghost, you are she-ghost.

550
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:24,038
Okay, I'm just kidding.
Actually you are...

551
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:25,406
I am?

552
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:28,208
Forget it

553
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,209
I am?
- Forget it.

554
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:34,480
I am?
- Jesus! Shivani, stop being spooky...

555
00:50:34,816 --> 00:50:36,374
and spare me.

556
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,618
You are beautiful, very beautiful.

557
00:50:53,835 --> 00:50:55,462
Why did you keep doing this?

558
00:50:58,172 --> 00:51:00,003
Have you ever been in love?

559
00:51:03,778 --> 00:51:06,178
I do, everyday.
- Grow up, Raj.

560
00:51:07,115 --> 00:51:10,414
Not that kind of love,
I'm talking about true love.

561
00:51:11,052 --> 00:51:14,453
Even I'm talking about true love.
Is my love a farce?

562
00:51:14,789 --> 00:51:16,484
Even I love truly.

563
00:51:21,062 --> 00:51:24,031
If you think true love is marriage,

564
00:51:26,701 --> 00:51:28,498
then I'm really not interested.

565
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,569
Have you seen Akshay?
He gets beaten up everyday.

566
00:51:35,076 --> 00:51:38,739
His wife used to run after him,
now he's running away from her.

567
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,145
Women! Women! Women.

568
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:45,742
Raj where the?
- AK, what's up, dude?

569
00:51:46,254 --> 00:51:48,484
You got a long life.
We were just talking about you.

570
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:49,756
Really?

571
00:51:52,793 --> 00:51:56,422
Forget it. When will you get time off
from your ghostly encounters?

572
00:51:56,731 --> 00:51:58,665
I've been waiting since morning.
Can't you even give me a call?

573
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:01,694
Pardon? Was I meant to call you?
- I see.

574
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:05,604
When I was committing the most
beautiful mistake of my life,

575
00:52:06,073 --> 00:52:08,598
you were busy taking our photographs...

576
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:13,571
And now when I rue those days, can't
you even give me a condolence call?

577
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:17,381
It's your anniversary.
I forgot, I'm so sorry

578
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,345
I'm also sorry

579
00:52:20,454 --> 00:52:23,446
Congratulations buddy.
- Mere wishes are not enough

580
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:26,726
I've organised a party at 8 tonight.
You know how dangerous Kuljeet is.

581
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:30,595
Of course.
- Be on time. And bring along...

582
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,430
the ghost.

583
00:52:33,768 --> 00:52:37,636
I would love you come.
- She says she'd love to come.

584
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:40,040
You are most welcome.
- Not up, she's next to you.

585
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:44,037
Do come at eight.
I'll see both of you at eight.

586
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,048
I think you should leave.
- Is she a vegetarian or non-veg?

587
00:52:48,249 --> 00:52:50,046
She can't eat.
- I see. She might like to drink?

588
00:52:50,284 --> 00:52:53,549
Drinks blood.
- Dracula's sister? Any preference?

589
00:52:53,854 --> 00:52:55,583
B positive.
- Don't worry, I'll organise it.

590
00:53:00,728 --> 00:53:03,390
Raj, my boy! Come in.
- AK, what's up? Congratulations.

591
00:53:03,698 --> 00:53:05,325
Congratulations for what?

592
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,393
For her?
- Kuljeet,

593
00:53:08,669 --> 00:53:09,636
Happy anniversary.

594
00:53:10,238 --> 00:53:13,002
Thank you, Raj. Are you all right?

595
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,674
Pardon? I'm absolutely fine.

596
00:53:17,178 --> 00:53:20,614
Raj, did you get Ms Invisible along?

597
00:53:21,082 --> 00:53:23,073
Yes, she's with me.

598
00:53:25,052 --> 00:53:28,419
How are you, lady?
Is everything fine in ghost world?

599
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:31,351
She's standing here
Both of you come inside.

600
00:53:39,734 --> 00:53:43,636
Raj Jaiswal of British Raj?
Not a bad show.

601
00:53:45,773 --> 00:53:49,607
Who's that?
- Our family psychiatrist, Dr Patnaik.

602
00:53:50,077 --> 00:53:53,740
We are happy because of him.
- So you guys think I need a shrink?

603
00:53:54,248 --> 00:53:56,978
No, no. No problem in meeting him.
- Come on.

604
00:53:57,218 --> 00:53:59,413
Have a drink.
- You will get advice for free. C'mon

605
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,985
It's okay, Raj,
I had also seen a ghost once.

606
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:06,191
In mirror.
- No. On the wedding altar.

607
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:10,688
Doctor, please have some hot samosa.
Kuljeet made them.

608
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,132
Have some.

609
00:54:14,235 --> 00:54:16,499
No? Raj, you try one.

610
00:54:17,305 --> 00:54:18,772
No, no, I'm full.

611
00:54:19,807 --> 00:54:23,334
Aishwarya Rai, wherever you are,
have a samosa.

612
00:54:23,644 --> 00:54:25,578
My wife made them.
Nothing will happen to you.

613
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:30,450
It's dangerous only for living being.
- Then you can eat after I kill you!

614
00:54:30,751 --> 00:54:33,481
Still I can't digest them.
- Today's our wedding anniversary!

615
00:54:33,788 --> 00:54:36,621
No wonder I was beaten up twice.
- I beat you yesterday, not today.

616
00:54:38,059 --> 00:54:39,720
We don't need samosas.
- Okay.

617
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:46,766
So Raj, where is this
ghostly girlfriend of yours?

618
00:54:49,737 --> 00:54:52,205
Right now Shivani's standing
near the window.

619
00:54:53,808 --> 00:54:55,298
I got it.

620
00:54:57,678 --> 00:55:00,442
Your parents are divorced, right?

621
00:55:02,683 --> 00:55:04,548
Yes. How do you know?

622
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:07,613
How do you know?
- The way he swings his legs.

623
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:09,989
It's a sign. I can tell.

624
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:15,191
Such a shame! A handsome guy...

625
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,656
You are a virgin, Raj.

626
00:55:19,033 --> 00:55:21,160
What?
- You are a virgin, Raj?

627
00:55:21,435 --> 00:55:22,402
No, no!

628
00:55:23,037 --> 00:55:24,504
How do you know?

629
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,009
His girlfriend is a ghost.
Now what do you expect?

630
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:33,145
What is this nonsense? And what
is the point of all of this?

631
00:55:33,714 --> 00:55:37,616
The point is, you need help.
And only I can help you out.

632
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,645
Exactly.
- Yeah, right.

633
00:55:41,389 --> 00:55:45,120
Now tell me, how does she look?

634
00:55:47,728 --> 00:55:49,696
Not like an ogre,
she looks simple and beautiful.

635
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:55,031
Raj, you need help.
You know what you have to do?
