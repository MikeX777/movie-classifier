00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,655
The Day Of The Owl

2
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:31,040
For Cinemageddon & Karakarga
May 2010

3
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,234
Help!

4
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:35,578
- Stop! Stop immediately!
- What's going on?

5
00:04:36,987 --> 00:04:38,784
- Open up!
- Why have we stopped?

6
00:04:38,948 --> 00:04:41,508
- I told you to open up!
- The door's stuck!

7
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,900
- There's a dead man.
- Dead? Who's dead?

8
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:54,870
- I don't know him.
- I think I know him from somewhere.

9
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:57,024
Really?

10
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,347
Why didn't you stop after seeing that dead man?

11
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:07,906
- I didn't see him.
- Not true, liar! You slowed down!

12
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:10,193
- No, I didn't...
- Go to hell.

13
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,873
The truck is from the building site.

14
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:24,598
- But there's blood there..
- Pass me a blanket or cloth.

15
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:31,955
- Here you go Sergeant.
- At the next stop, call the Marshal in town.

16
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:37,195
Tell him, that Salvatore Colasberna
was shot near Fiore.

17
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:42,136
Is that clear? So go on!
Get on board! Quickly!

18
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:24,456
I knew, that he'd end up like that.
Some people are dead even when they're alive.

19
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:27,251
He said he could live without friends.
And now look at him.

20
00:06:29,785 --> 00:06:32,618
- Who's living in that house?
- Someone called Nicolosi. He's not at home.

21
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:34,937
He went to work early in the morning.

22
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:37,826
I spoke to his wife.
She said that she didn't hear the gunshots.

23
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:41,867
Didn't hear anyone, didn't see anyone,
doesn't know anybody, doesnt go anywhere.

24
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:46,022
<i>- Hello?. Wolf calling wolf
- Roger! Wolf speaking. Tell me Marshal.</i>

25
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,822
<i>- Give me the captain.
- Right away Marshal.</i>

26
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,822
- When did you find him?
- At 7:15.

27
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:54,187
Here in Sicily they're killing Christians
before sunrise.

28
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:57,990
They only killed one this afternoon,
Pistilli the public notary

29
00:06:58,154 --> 00:06:59,712
he likes to sleep.

30
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:04,790
Roger! Captain, they've killed
Salvatore Colasberna near Fiore.

31
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:08,586
<i>- Colasberna? The one from the construction firm?
- Yes, the owner.</i>

32
00:07:08,738 --> 00:07:09,751
<i>Any idea of the motive yet Marshal?</i>

33
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,468
Perhaps because of the new road?
It's created a lot of interest recently.

34
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:26,822
Here's La Stella's building firm.
La Stella is that fat slob who drinks a lot.

35
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:29,638
It's him that built those farmhouses
on marshland.

36
00:07:29,965 --> 00:07:33,435
The house that was smashed by
a cow was built by his firm.

37
00:07:33,606 --> 00:07:35,836
He held a meeting with all the
foremen and said that..

38
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:40,558
I know, he said 'Whoever does houses with
concrete instead of sand and cowpat is a fool'.

39
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:45,883
- Or a cop!
- No, no, a fool. It's very important not to be a fool.

40
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,409
A fool is almost as bad as being a cuckold
- but a cuckold is the worst of all.

41
00:07:58,014 --> 00:08:01,768
- They're like flies on a corpse.
- They won't find a thing..

42
00:08:03,536 --> 00:08:06,972
That's Pizzuco,
he has a cousin in parliament.

43
00:08:07,658 --> 00:08:10,218
And a criminal record as long
as the road he's building.

44
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:13,290
- He has a lot of power around here!
- A man of respect, eh?

45
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,056
- Exactly that Captain!
- And where was he yesterday morning at six?

46
00:08:17,221 --> 00:08:23,012
At home. Sleeping like all the others:
Pizzuco, La Stella, Lancia, Colossimo..

47
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:28,213
All of them new in town..respectable
citizens that don't kill anymore

48
00:08:28,465 --> 00:08:32,253
Perhaps they'll order a hit...and pay.
Not a lot but they pay.

49
00:08:37,067 --> 00:08:42,744
Stop..look who's walking around here.
Rosa Nicolosi.

50
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,707
She's the woman who lives
near the scene of the crime.

51
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:59,510
- What are you doing here Rosa Nicolosi?
- I was picking some chicory and cabbages.

52
00:08:59,675 --> 00:09:01,825
And with so much land around why right here?

53
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:05,269
Why come and look for chicory and
cabbages right here?

54
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:07,871
And why not?
Am I doing something wrong?

55
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:10,871
The chicory doesn't belong to anyone,
it's just chicory.

56
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,351
Everything belongs to someone,
even the chicory.

57
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,831
Come on, get on.
We'll take you to your house.

58
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:22,516
Don't be afraid,
we're not taking you to the barracks!

59
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:25,834
Well? He's talking to you!
Move it!

60
00:09:37,928 --> 00:09:39,759
Come on, get moving.

61
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:49,425
The shots must have come from there,
just after the bend.

62
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:51,320
From there, Colasberna was wounded and the truck

63
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:54,563
probably went on another hundred metres
up to where the jeep is.

64
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:58,123
that's where the killer caught up
with Colasberna - and it was all over.

65
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:03,087
From there, someone must have seen
or at least heard the shots.

66
00:10:06,577 --> 00:10:10,411
- And where does your husband work?
- Wherever he can.

67
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,328
- Does he work every day?
- No. Only when he's lucky.

68
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,095
- What time does he leave the house in the morning?
- I don't know..it depends.

69
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:23,380
- And what time does he get back in the evening?
- He doesn't have a timetable.

70
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:26,814
And this morning?
What time did he leave?

71
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:32,857
Look Rosa, you don't have to be afraid.

72
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:36,941
I'm not accusing your husband.
If he wanted to kill someone,

73
00:10:37,108 --> 00:10:40,464
he wouldn't do it in front of his house.
It's perhaps a little obvious?!

74
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:45,511
I'm only looking for information.
Come on, give me a hand?

75
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:48,322
Excuse me..but where are you from?

76
00:10:50,392 --> 00:10:53,429
- I'm from Parma.
- Near Milan?

77
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:58,712
- Yes, near Milan.
- And they don't kill anyone there?

78
00:11:00,675 --> 00:11:02,711
Sure they do!
But in a different way.

79
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:08,872
And do the people there testify
...without fear?

80
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:14,079
No, it's the same for us too.
Tight-lipped as usual..but not from fear.

81
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,712
It's because the people don't want any
nuisance, or to waste time with the trial.

82
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:21,874
We've got plenty of time here.

83
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:26,695
And plenty of chicory too!
Why did you go looking for it near the building site?

84
00:11:26,884 --> 00:11:28,363
Because it's better there!

85
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:32,598
Chicory is chicory, cabbage is
cabbage - it grows everywhere!

86
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:38,042
Did you see your husband last night?
Did you hear him come back?

87
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,768
So he might not have come back at all?

88
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:44,819
So then, say it:
"He didn't come back"

89
00:11:44,992 --> 00:11:48,631
Say it:
"He left yesterday morning and didn't return"

90
00:11:49,892 --> 00:11:52,087
Sometimes he doesn't come back.

91
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:56,845
Ok, so let's say he didn't return.
Why didn't he come back?

92
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:59,892
Well, I'll tell you.
Because he doesn't want to be interrogated.

93
00:12:00,055 --> 00:12:03,809
Because he doesn't want to talk.
Because he doesn't want to be implicated.

94
00:12:05,377 --> 00:12:09,814
Ok..Please, when he returns
tell him to come to the station.

95
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,812
Or at least he can call us.
It's just a formality.

96
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,020
Dominici!
Come on, let's go!

97
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:30,537
This is Colasberna's building site.
They're off for the funeral.

98
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:33,459
Was Colasberna friends with
the others: Pizzuco, Lancia, La Stella?

99
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,778
No, just a hello and a goodbye.
Colasberna was the reserved type.

100
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:40,907
He only got along with his brothers.
He was a decent, honest worker.

101
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:44,147
To steal money from the government
you need company

102
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,187
and he didn't agree with it.
Understand?

103
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,821
He also had a police record too though.

104
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:51,790
I questioned some of the truck drivers
that are always on this road.

105
00:12:51,953 --> 00:12:53,711
No-one saw or heard anything.

106
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:56,554
A population of blind and deaf,
but when they shoot - then they can see!

107
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,468
Boy can they see!

108
00:12:59,075 --> 00:13:04,388
Hey! Why are you still using bags?
Isn't it better to use tankers like they are?

109
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,392
- We can't rent the tankers.
- And why is that?

110
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:12,075
- We just simply can't..
- Have you had some trouble?

111
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:17,597
They threw an excavator down into a
ravine but they didn't press charges,true?

112
00:13:19,402 --> 00:13:21,148
What type of sentence did Colasberna have?

113
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:24,387
Six months in confinement for
Anti-Fascism when he was 25.

114
00:13:25,844 --> 00:13:29,837
- But these aren't criminal offences.
- Sorry but according to the law it is.

115
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:33,282
Then it should also apply to the
President of the Republic too.

116
00:13:45,811 --> 00:13:48,883
Ok. Write down what I dictate to you.

117
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:54,365
Salvatore Colasberna was killed,

118
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:59,329
because he was allowed to win a deal

119
00:14:00,055 --> 00:14:04,253
against a friend of the friends,

120
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:10,653
that paid for the outsourcing of a quarter

121
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,336
of the new road

122
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:21,899
and he didn't want to share this with anyone.

123
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:26,973
Signed: "A friend"

124
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,864
No thank you.
I don't smoke.

125
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:53,100
- So, he was killed for this?
- We knew nothing about it.

126
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:58,509
How's that? You just put it
in an anonymous letter to me!

127
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:01,667
You both took turns to write
one word each.

128
00:15:01,836 --> 00:15:05,715
It's a bit of a primitive system
but thanks all the same.

129
00:15:05,877 --> 00:15:08,949
But we didn't write anything Captain.

130
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,033
Ok...but in order to continue,
I have to know more.

131
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:17,271
And what should we tell you?

132
00:15:22,683 --> 00:15:27,154
Take a look at this lovely map.
There are many flags - black, red and green.

133
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:33,039
The black flags are for unsolved murders,
red for the ones we're still investigating,

134
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:37,400
and the green flags for the cases
which have been resolved and punished.

135
00:15:37,568 --> 00:15:39,877
There still aren't many of those...!

136
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:44,527
The murder of your brother has a red flag.

137
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:50,528
It's up to you to turn it green.

138
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:56,966
- So?
- I see a lot more of the black flags Captain.

139
00:15:57,815 --> 00:16:01,649
You're saying that you don't talk
because the killers are still on the loose

140
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:04,330
but the killers are on the loose
because you won't talk!

141
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,852
And now we're back at the start again!

142
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:11,815
Fine...

143
00:16:16,221 --> 00:16:19,651
Your letter will remain anonymous,
I don't want you living in fear.

144
00:16:19,662 --> 00:16:21,102
You can go.

145
00:16:23,343 --> 00:16:26,972
- Our respects Captain.
- Good day.

146
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,149
Rosa Nicolosi

147
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:09,713
Captain, it's Rosa Nicolosi.
Come in, come in.

148
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,509
Come on in, Rosa.

149
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:24,121
Have a seat. Don't worry,
nobody can see you.

150
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:33,556
Aren't you going to ask me anything?

151
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:38,323
I didn't summon you.
I have nothing to ask you.

152
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:42,004
He didn't come back..

153
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,922
You said that sometimes he doesn't return..

154
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:49,544
You weren't worried then...
So why are you worried now?

155
00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:54,927
It's been four days.

156
00:17:55,654 --> 00:17:58,726
Ok. Marshal, let's get someone
to look for this Nicolosi.

157
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:00,487
Yes sir.

158
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:06,253
But where should we look?
Far away or here nearby?

159
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:23,638
- Has someone threatened you?
- My husband has a clean record.

160
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:28,403
I know, I know...but it's difficult
to look for a needle in a haystack

161
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,716
and your husband, in Sicily...
is like a needle..

162
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:41,141
Maybe at this moment your
husband needs help?...A lot of help.

163
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:47,344
And what's his wife doing?
She's silent. Doesn't want to help.

164
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:51,546
- Just what kind of wife is she?
- I'd give my blood for him.

165
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:56,684
The other morning near your house
there were four rifle shots.

166
00:18:57,455 --> 00:19:00,492
Where was your husband
when they were fired?

167
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,611
Now then Rosa, we're all alone.
No-one can see us.

168
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:22,131
We won't write anything down.
So then, where was your husband?

169
00:19:22,303 --> 00:19:27,457
- He left early...at five.
- In the dark?

170
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:31,262
- Yes
- Did you hear the shots?

171
00:19:31,466 --> 00:19:34,344
- Yes I did.
- Did you take a look outside?

172
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,544
No, I thought that it was a hunter.

173
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,268
- But it's not hunting season.
- And how should I know?...

174
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,628
- Where did your husband go?
- To look for work.

175
00:19:45,991 --> 00:19:49,540
- At the building sites?
- Maybe...

176
00:19:49,832 --> 00:19:52,949
So when we saw you that morning
on the road you were looking for him?

177
00:19:53,113 --> 00:19:56,628
- No..I was looking for...
- Chicory and cabbages..

178
00:19:57,915 --> 00:20:00,880
Well perhaps he disappeared
for another reason?

179
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:05,380
And if so Rosa,
for once, tell me, ok?

180
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:18,311
- It appears that she has a lover.
- Says who?

181
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:21,280
Don Ciccio the barber,
he told Corporal Torres.

182
00:20:21,443 --> 00:20:23,240
Seems everyone knows about it.

183
00:20:23,403 --> 00:20:26,042
If you'll excuse me, I have to go.
My daughter's alone at home.

184
00:20:26,204 --> 00:20:27,557
Very well.

185
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:32,162
- Captain, promise me you'll look for him?
- We'll look for him.

186
00:20:32,326 --> 00:20:34,317
God bless you.

187
00:20:36,328 --> 00:20:42,119
- And who is this lover?
- Well, they didn't say but it's clear it's not Rosa's first time.

188
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,889
It's probably a woman who's been gossiping .
What else do you know?

189
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,521
They also say that her head is
full of strange ideas.

190
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:53,407
One time she left home to go to
Palermo to be a shop assistant.

191
00:20:53,614 --> 00:20:56,333
Well, I'd hardly call that a scandal.
It's a job like any other.

192
00:20:56,495 --> 00:21:01,489
Sure. But such a beautiful woman
must be unhappy to be the wife of an idler.

193
00:21:02,817 --> 00:21:06,207
- So why did she marry?
- She got pregnant at 16 years old.

194
00:21:06,858 --> 00:21:09,656
- I understand..
- And where's she going?

195
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,653
To Don Mariano Arena.
A wealthy man..

196
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,732
..he has a daughter studying in Switzerland
and a fat bank account.

197
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:17,971
A high-flyer who's made it good.

198
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:23,815
A woman's here, she's saying she wants
to speak to you. She's in the front room.

199
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:31,224
My respects...

200
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:40,059
- Who are you?
- Rosa Nicolosi, Tano Nicolosi's wife.

201
00:21:40,229 --> 00:21:42,026
And what do you want from me?

202
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,542
Sorry, but my husband hasn't been
back home for four days.

203
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,701
And you've come to look for him here?

204
00:21:50,793 --> 00:21:54,866
No, I was just thinking that if you wanted,
you could help me to find him?

205
00:21:55,034 --> 00:21:59,073
Why not go to the Carabinieri?
They're the ones who look for missing people.

206
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:02,230
I've already been to the Carabinieri.

207
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:06,066
You did good.
It's your duty.

208
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:10,948
I told them that my husband hadn't
returned...nothing else.

209
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,636
I didn't tell them what I could have.
I didn't name anyone.

210
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,112
And what can I do?

211
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:24,832
If I see your husband,
I'll tell him not to make you worry.

212
00:22:25,004 --> 00:22:28,201
We've always voted
like you wanted us to.

213
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:34,320
Good. Santuzza!
Come here, Rosa.

214
00:22:34,607 --> 00:22:36,795
Give something to this good woman,
she has a young girl.

215
00:22:36,806 --> 00:22:39,493
Give them one of our hens, ok?

216
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,440
Wait, Rosa.

217
00:22:43,552 --> 00:22:44,552
Ah, give it here!

218
00:22:55,494 --> 00:22:58,054
Here. Eat it tomorrow, ok.

219
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:02,971
Wait, I'll give you
some jars of marmalade too.

220
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:04,112
Take these.

221
00:23:05,338 --> 00:23:11,573
- Now, go back home and don't worry, ok?
- God bless you.

222
00:23:25,144 --> 00:23:29,854
Beautiful woman. All beautiful -
the hips...the breasts...

223
00:23:30,906 --> 00:23:34,421
It's odd...that just today Don Ciccio the
Barber wants us to know that

224
00:23:34,627 --> 00:23:36,777
that Nicolosi had a lover?

225
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,064
Don't you believe him?

226
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:41,928
Look, I'm not exactly left enchanted
by Rosa Nicolosi's ways...

227
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,788
Maybe she's a liar or very cunning.

228
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:47,145
But what I'd like to know
is if they're going

229
00:23:47,156 --> 00:23:49,924
to start playing tricks to try and
change the motive of the crime.

230
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:52,389
Which is?

231
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:55,223
What can you find very cheap here in Sicily?

232
00:23:58,155 --> 00:24:00,953
What thing can be found at the
street corners or on the stalls?

233
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:04,904
- I don't know.
- Honour. Honour, Marshal!

234
00:24:05,078 --> 00:24:08,309
It's the answer to it all.
We must look for Nicolosi at once

235
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:10,549
and pull those horns off of his head!

236
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,233
- Marshal, you have a son studying engineering, right?
- Yes, why? What's happened?

237
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:21,761
- Is he afraid of Carabinieri too?
- No! That would be the last straw!

238
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:26,163
Excuse me, but have you taken exams
on construction?

239
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:28,793
- Of course!
- He took thirty!

240
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:32,242
I want to prove that everyone around
here stole except for Colasberna.

241
00:24:32,407 --> 00:24:35,763
That is - poor construction
and falsified technical data.

242
00:24:35,928 --> 00:24:39,967
You'll need a civil engineer, an expert.
I'm only a student.

243
00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:42,945
If I wait for the court to appoint an expert..

244
00:24:43,466 --> 00:24:45,766
..the investigation will also be at a
stand still for a year.

245
00:24:46,331 --> 00:24:50,165
If the State mechanism isn't working,
it's not the fault of me or my generation.

246
00:24:50,373 --> 00:24:55,845
Captain, my son didn't follow in my footsteps,
he only thinks about his degree.

247
00:24:56,015 --> 00:24:59,087
Yes, I can see!.
And when he finishes his studies..

248
00:24:59,256 --> 00:25:01,895
..his employers will be those that
build these roads.

249
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:09,746
- And if there'll be a killer amongst them?
- It's not up to engineers to look for killers.

250
00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:12,698
It's up to us all!

251
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:17,136
If you don't need me anymore...

252
00:25:18,942 --> 00:25:19,897
Bye Dad.

253
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:34,216
Colasberna wanted things to be clean.
He was stubborn.

254
00:25:34,388 --> 00:25:37,346
He didn't want to pay for protection.
And he refused to blackmail.

255
00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:39,625
Captain!..

256
00:25:39,989 --> 00:25:42,298
But those who pay protection know
that  they'll never get inspected,

257
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,837
therefore they can go on quietly building
their bridges with manure!

258
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:48,340
If we don't get rid of these people,
they'll kill someone else.

259
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,871
And in the meantime we're still looking
for Colasberna's killer.

260
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,509
And this is my fear above all,
that it's not the last of the killings.

261
00:25:55,875 --> 00:26:00,073
This one's capable of coming
here every day to get on our nerves.

262
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:02,227
- Add a bit more cement!
- Ok

263
00:26:03,077 --> 00:26:07,016
Without anonymous letters or informers,
we'd be going round in circles

264
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:09,190
and you know that Captain.

265
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,992
I'm sorry Captain, but it's my experience
that makes me a bit controversial.

266
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:19,877
You're still enthusiastic
and without kids at university.

267
00:26:20,843 --> 00:26:22,276
Who is our informer here?

268
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:39,516
Parineddu, I'm here.

269
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,499
At your service Captain.

270
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:52,848
Parineddu, do you know where
Colasberna was killed?

271
00:26:53,174 --> 00:26:57,292
Yes, he was found dead there.
Murdered.

272
00:26:57,455 --> 00:27:00,285
- By who?
- By who...

273
00:27:01,337 --> 00:27:02,531
Wake up! I asked you who?

274
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:05,655
- If only I knew..
- So what do you know?

275
00:27:05,818 --> 00:27:09,049
Captain, let's not talk here.
Let's get away from the road.

276
00:27:14,941 --> 00:27:19,651
I need to stay alive Captain.
It's in the interest of justice.

277
00:27:19,863 --> 00:27:26,052
Yes sir, there are plenty of captains and
carabinieri - but informers are rare.

278
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:29,063
You mustn't send me off to the
slaughter in such a hurry!

279
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:34,177
Look, if you don't let out what you know,
I'll send you to the butchers right away!

280
00:27:36,308 --> 00:27:38,663
Look, I'm running out of patience with you.

281
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:41,535
Have you seen Rosa Nicolosi?
She's watching us.

282
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:43,917
She's switched off the light but
she still spying.

283
00:27:43,938 --> 00:27:47,025
She wants to know what two people are
doing talking near the spot where he died.

284
00:27:47,392 --> 00:27:50,031
Forget Rosa Nicolosi.
Talk instead!

285
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:56,706
Talk, talk, talk!
Captain, the informer merely hints, he doesn't reveal.

286
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:03,665
The real truth lies between a thousand lies,
because the informer doesn't trust the carabinieri.

287
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:07,208
And you told me now that if I didn't talk

288
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,791
tomorrow you'd tell the killers
that I betrayed them, eh?

289
00:28:17,802 --> 00:28:23,683
- And so?
- Or you can summon me to court, as a witness.

290
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:28,471
- No. I can assure you.
- But who knows?

291
00:28:28,827 --> 00:28:33,465
The betrayal ends up being
wholly unneccessary and turns into disgrace.

292
00:28:34,238 --> 00:28:36,918
Captain, betrayal is a living for me.

293
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:40,027
This evening I betray the mafia,
tomorrow the Carabineri.

294
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:42,494
It's balanced.
A little bit for everyone!

295
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:46,328
Good, now get to the point.

296
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:53,683
The order came from the cement,
but who was to shoot was decided by a card game.

297
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:59,288
Two shots, and a cuckold met
the King of Diamonds.

298
00:29:00,016 --> 00:29:03,167
It's not true that cuckolds are lucky!

299
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:08,857
- And so the cuckold is Nicolosi?.
- Easy, Captain! Not so fast..

300
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:14,133
We're talking about an imaginary cuckold.
Nameless, just simply a cuckold.

301
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:20,889
But whoever murdered Colasberna, killed him
because of cement, and not for horns.

302
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:28,298
Careful Captain.
There is a catch, but you can't see it.

303
00:29:29,346 --> 00:29:32,941
So Parineddu,
you're also in with them too?

304
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:36,981
Captain, if you're not happy with me
and don't want give me the money,

305
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:40,745
you can pay me another time
when you feel more satisfied.

306
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:53,668
How do you manage to be an informer?
You..you're scared stiff!

307
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:59,433
There's always a little bit of fear, no?.
Or perhaps not you?

308
00:30:01,997 --> 00:30:07,025
Look, with the help of your information,
before I arrived here

309
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:10,924
the previous person in charge arrested two
fugitives and a smuggler.

310
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:16,040
Why so much small talk this time Parineddu?

311
00:30:17,962 --> 00:30:20,396
Is it hot stuff?

312
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:28,398
So they're big shots, eh?
Powerful people?

313
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:34,799
Captain, cement and horns...
the name of the king of diamonds..

314
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:40,399
Try to talk to that pretty woman.
If you can find a way.

315
00:30:51,534 --> 00:30:56,130
- Rosa! Rosa Nicolosi!
- Who is it?

316
00:30:56,295 --> 00:31:00,083
- Captain Bellodi.
- What do you want?

317
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:02,977
I need to talk to you.

318
00:31:16,422 --> 00:31:22,019
I'm sorry, I have bad news for you.
Your husband's been killed.

319
00:31:22,584 --> 00:31:25,337
They shot him.
We don't know who it was,

320
00:31:25,505 --> 00:31:26,858
but we're searching for him.

321
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:30,097
Zecchinetta!

322
00:31:30,427 --> 00:31:32,861
Zecchinetta?
He killed Colasberna?

323
00:31:33,027 --> 00:31:37,100
- Yes!  - Your husband saw him
and he knew that he'd been seen?

324
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:42,261
I told him when I heard the shots..
..I told him..

325
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,376
Don't leave the house!...
Don't go out!..

326
00:31:45,397 --> 00:31:49,099
Why didn't he listen to me?
Why didn't he listen to me?

327
00:31:53,194 --> 00:31:58,491
No, no Rosa! Calm yourself,
it's not true! It's not true..

328
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,093
I made it up..

329
00:32:01,757 --> 00:32:04,317
We still don't know anything
about your husband.

330
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:08,027
I needed a name...
I'm sorry.

331
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:15,512
How could you!
You do what you want, eh?

332
00:32:16,922 --> 00:32:21,712
- I have to find the killer.
- And my husband? Where is he?

333
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:24,114
We're still searching for him.

334
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:29,194
So, that morning after he saw Zecchinetta,
what did he do?

335
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:36,106
I know, I know
what you want to say to me..

336
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,796
You want to say to me:
"Go to hell dirty cop"

337
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:47,431
You shouldn't have said what you
did to me...that he was dead..

338
00:32:48,115 --> 00:32:50,131
It's not a joke.

339
00:32:56,455 --> 00:33:00,573
Who is this 'Zecchinetta'?
It's not his real name.

340
00:33:00,737 --> 00:33:04,013
He's called that because he plays (cards), no?

341
00:33:04,938 --> 00:33:06,769
The name, Rosa!

342
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:08,856
I don't know.

343
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,377
Didn't your husband ever tell you?

344
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,134
- No.
- And you've never seen him in person?

345
00:33:14,301 --> 00:33:16,451
No.

346
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:21,097
And why did you go to see Don Mariano?

347
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:26,181
To see whether I could sell him
something...some eggs.

348
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:31,244
Now..

349
00:33:35,228 --> 00:33:38,538
The plot for 200 million lira,
goes to you.

350
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:44,262
The one for 250 million is for La Stella.
It's a nice dowry for his daughter's wedding.

351
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:50,910
We'll leave the 50 million plot to the
brothers of our late friend Salvatore Colasberna.

352
00:33:51,074 --> 00:33:54,862
Martino the bishop's nephew expected some too..

353
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:58,704
I don't want to ruin the bishop's nephew!

354
00:33:59,396 --> 00:34:04,151
The plot for 50 million is for the
Colasberna brothers.

355
00:34:05,118 --> 00:34:11,432
There's nothing better to help forget
the dead...than economic difficulties.

356
00:34:11,456 --> 00:34:13,245
They'll lose everything they have.

357
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,060
They'll be inspected every day
with routine checks and then..

358
00:34:16,071 --> 00:34:20,957
..occasionally, some little accidents as well..

359
00:34:21,564 --> 00:34:25,523
As for Martino, I'll give him
a waste disposal contract.

360
00:34:25,685 --> 00:34:27,721
Refuse has good returns.

361
00:34:27,886 --> 00:34:34,041
No offence, but his Excellency had
already promised that contract to my cousin.

362
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:46,721
His Excellency can't promise anything.
He can only handle his affairs..

363
00:34:47,332 --> 00:34:51,007
..because I take care of things here.
And he handles Rome.

364
00:34:55,015 --> 00:34:58,690
- I agree
- Ok

365
00:34:59,056 --> 00:35:01,331
Ok with me also

366
00:35:02,498 --> 00:35:04,648
Me too

367
00:35:20,223 --> 00:35:23,499
Hey, it's lively out there..

368
00:35:31,427 --> 00:35:34,658
Look how the captain's trying to do his best.

369
00:35:36,629 --> 00:35:38,904
They've arrested someone.

370
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,389
Geraci, Cinisi, Passatempo...

371
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:50,432
- And Zecchinetta!
- Zecchinetta? - Yeah..

372
00:35:50,754 --> 00:35:52,779
- And who's that one?
- Parineddu.

373
00:35:53,656 --> 00:35:55,373
What happened?

374
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:58,713
- He said they were playing zecchinetta (cards).
- Where?

375
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:01,225
At Parineddu's house.

376
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:09,915
You can tell His Excellency, that it isn't
good to have a gung-ho captain like him here.

377
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:14,719
Saro, bring up some ice cream.

378
00:36:16,402 --> 00:36:19,838
Ignazio! Five ice creams!

379
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:37,076
Look at that..greeting each other..
My respects..my respects..

380
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:41,123
and here they are still, these
big shots, they're not going anywhere.

381
00:36:46,812 --> 00:36:51,044
Perhaps they're wondering if I've arrested
those guys for gambling or for something else.

382
00:36:51,214 --> 00:36:52,852
We need to let them know.

383
00:36:53,015 --> 00:36:55,927
Captain, do you plan to let
those we arrested walk free?

384
00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:58,212
- Absolutely!
- And Parineddu, right?

385
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:02,211
- Sure, and him too, otherwise he's done for.
- Shall we let them go then?

386
00:37:03,498 --> 00:37:07,411
Not right away, later.
All..except for one.

387
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:14,059
They play (cards) every day,
and the carabinieri never came before.

388
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:17,020
But it's the first time they played
at Parineddu's house.

389
00:37:21,144 --> 00:37:23,897
That's true.
Never played there before...

390
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:28,940
So, Zecchinetta goes to play at Parineddu's
house...and then the cops arrive...

391
00:37:29,187 --> 00:37:32,975
The captain's watching us
...with binoculars.

392
00:37:34,148 --> 00:37:37,299
I don't like binoculars...

393
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,743
What are you doing?
You think you know me?

394
00:37:42,911 --> 00:37:45,823
Yeah, look at me...look at my profile too!

395
00:37:46,552 --> 00:37:47,951
You're nobody!

396
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:51,623
Try and touch us if you have the guts..

397
00:37:52,514 --> 00:37:55,233
Don't assume that these cops are all stupid!

398
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:59,829
There are those that can tear out
your tongue along with all your secrets.

399
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:04,036
Men who were born cops,
just as others were born priests.

400
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,553
Bellodi is one that was born a cop..

401
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:12,830
Parineddu on the other hand..
was born a spy.

402
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:53,648
Zecchinetta hasn't come out yet.

403
00:38:56,416 --> 00:39:00,807
What did you expect?
They want to squeeze a confession out of him.

404
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,175
We've got a traitor among us,
I'm sure of it.

405
00:39:10,821 --> 00:39:12,573
Don Mariano..

406
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:18,793
Don Mariano!

407
00:39:23,505 --> 00:39:26,065
May I have a word?.
I have to talk to you.

408
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:30,378
- Play...well, speak!
- In private!

409
00:39:31,428 --> 00:39:35,387
In private with you?!
And who are you, the Lord?

410
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:39,258
As you wish then.

411
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:54,107
Let's go for a walk.

412
00:39:56,036 --> 00:39:58,152
Don Mariano,
did you write that letter?

413
00:39:58,317 --> 00:40:00,990
- Of course, don't worry.
- Thank you.

414
00:40:10,881 --> 00:40:15,477
Zecchinetta sent me and urged me
to tell you that his lips are sealed.

415
00:40:15,642 --> 00:40:20,079
Zecchinetta? And who's he?
In my opinion he can spend his whole life in there.

416
00:40:20,884 --> 00:40:23,352
That's what he said,
so that's what I'm telling you.

417
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:32,485
Parineddu!

418
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:36,605
How was the game?

419
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,986
Well, I won..but they
blew the whistle on us all

420
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:45,245
so I guess we all lost in the end..

421
00:41:03,758 --> 00:41:06,532
You shouldn't have gone
up against the Santa Chiesa.

422
00:41:06,688 --> 00:41:08,620
What can you do now? Nothing.

423
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:11,865
I'm just saying that you're
dead in the heart of your friends.

424
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:16,677
- ..34..35..36..
- Let's go Zecchinetta, the captain wants to question you.

425
00:41:16,843 --> 00:41:21,473
Just a moment, I have to do my exercises first.
..37..38..

426
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:24,283
- Move it!
- One moment, I need to do something..

427
00:41:24,445 --> 00:41:25,798
Come on!

428
00:41:26,806 --> 00:41:29,798
..I should introduce myself
whilst doing my trousers up?

429
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:33,803
My respects Captain!
I knew the captain,

430
00:41:33,968 --> 00:41:38,007
who was here before you.
A man of good heart!

431
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:44,247
Captain, if you want to beat me up,
I've something I must tell you first,

432
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:48,001
I suffered from pleurisy, they
took an x-ray, did you know that?

433
00:41:48,373 --> 00:41:51,843
So, how are we doing Mr Marchica,
alias 'Zecchinetta'?

434
00:41:52,014 --> 00:41:55,450
Given your past crimes, I can't let you go.

435
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:59,925
However, no one will ever
know what you tell me.

436
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:01,620
And what do I have to tell you?

437
00:42:01,871 --> 00:42:06,088
I want to get to ones at the top and
if you help me, you won't regret it.

438
00:42:06,259 --> 00:42:11,014
- If I may Captain...
- Very well. So let's talk about the game.

439
00:42:12,101 --> 00:42:16,174
We played a lot to pass time.
There aren't any free women in this country!

440
00:42:16,343 --> 00:42:18,031
And a wife just isn't enough.

441
00:42:18,388 --> 00:42:22,180
Someone who is content with just
one woman loses their imagination.

442
00:42:22,345 --> 00:42:27,260
For example, when I'm in bed with her,
I always think of Stalin.

443
00:42:27,986 --> 00:42:30,022
- How much did you lose?
- Me!?

444
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:31,859
- You.
- A little.

445
00:42:32,188 --> 00:42:34,941
- How much is 'a little'?
- Let's say about twenty.

446
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:38,499
- Do you lose every day?
- No, some days I'm up.

447
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:45,348
- No, you're not the winning type.
- The testimony of your friends shows,

448
00:42:45,912 --> 00:42:49,985
that in the last two weeks you
lost around 200,000 lira.

449
00:42:50,154 --> 00:42:53,464
- Says who? I did win!
- Against who?

450
00:42:53,675 --> 00:42:56,031
Someone from 'out of town', let's say.

451
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:59,549
My understanding is that the money you
lost at cards is money that Pizzuco gave you.

452
00:42:59,917 --> 00:43:01,316
Why did Pizzuco pay you?

453
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:04,506
Captain, Pizzuco never gave me any money.
Whoever said that is big...

454
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:07,235
...a bastard, I know!
- There, exactly!

455
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,751
So you won a game worth 200,000
lira against a foreigner,

456
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:15,517
and then you lost this money whilst
playing against friends. Is that so?

457
00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,996
- Shall we say it was like that?
- ..yeah, it was like that.

458
00:43:21,204 --> 00:43:23,877
- Write that..take it all down.
- No wait,

459
00:43:24,045 --> 00:43:28,038
Marchica may want to clarify.
Have a think about it.

460
00:43:28,207 --> 00:43:32,120
There's nothing to think about Captain.
Liars need to think.

461
00:43:32,288 --> 00:43:34,677
What I'm saying is the truth!

462
00:43:35,049 --> 00:43:38,928
But you Captain..
before you talk you have to think

463
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,799
because you tell lies.
You tell lies for a living! Get it?

464
00:43:42,972 --> 00:43:45,850
- Yeah, yeah. You should be an actor.
- Heh, well...

465
00:43:46,013 --> 00:43:50,733
- Yeah, why not? You've got talent!
- C'mon, you're teasing me Captain!

466
00:43:51,374 --> 00:43:55,162
- Where did you put the rifle?
- What? Which rifle?

467
00:43:55,336 --> 00:43:57,770
The rifle with which you shot Nicolosi?

468
00:43:57,916 --> 00:43:59,289
- Me!?
- Yes, you.

469
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:02,766
Nicolosi?
Captain! Me!?...

470
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:05,612
"Me? Me? Me? Me?" - Don't you
know to say anything other than 'Me'?

471
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:09,495
Ah, you didn't know Nicolosi?
Have a good think about it.

472
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,778
Yeah, I knew him...
so?...

473
00:44:15,102 --> 00:44:19,254
Captain..a bit of that beer wouldn't hurt, right?

474
00:44:20,464 --> 00:44:21,863
Thanks, thanks!..

475
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:26,655
You said that you 'knew' him, you
want to say that you know he's dead?

476
00:44:27,506 --> 00:44:29,303
The marshal said that I killed him!

477
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:32,937
I said that you fired - but now
you just clarified that you killed him.

478
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:35,902
- Captain!
- Yes..

479
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,021
..because Marchica, you
have been accused of murdering Nicolosi.

480
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:42,546
Haven't you realised?

481
00:44:42,711 --> 00:44:46,750
Prove it! You need proof!
What motive would I have to do it?

482
00:44:46,993 --> 00:44:48,472
Where is it?!
What is this motive?

483
00:44:48,633 --> 00:44:53,167
The motive? Here it is - Nicolosi died because
he saw who killed Colasberna.

484
00:44:53,352 --> 00:44:55,250
He had seen the killer.

485
00:44:55,836 --> 00:45:01,035
- And who killed this Colasberna?
- You! Admit it Zecchinetta, it was you!

486
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:05,186
Me? Me?! Pull out my fingernails,
and break my fingers

487
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,352
and you'll have a great confession!
Let go! Leave me alone!

488
00:45:09,801 --> 00:45:13,635
I'll jump out the window!
You're taking advantage cos I'm alone..

489
00:45:13,802 --> 00:45:20,753
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I can't take it, cowards! I want to die!

490
00:45:30,808 --> 00:45:35,962
Captain, if you'll allow me to go free,
I'll give you a nice present..

491
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:41,480
..I'll give you the name of Colasberna's
killer and the motive.

492
00:45:42,211 --> 00:45:46,250
- We're listening.
- Nicolosi killed Colasberna...

493
00:45:46,893 --> 00:45:50,363
...because he caught him
in an awkward position!

494
00:45:50,534 --> 00:45:54,413
- Such as?
- He was on top of his wife, Rosa..

495
00:45:54,936 --> 00:45:57,689
..they were lovers.
Everyone knew that they were lovers.

496
00:45:57,857 --> 00:46:03,495
So then tell me who killed Nicolosi, after he
killed Colasberna to protect his honour?

497
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:07,095
Nicolosi? Why are you saying that he's dead?
You should say he's missing!

498
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,014
To say that someone is dead, you need a body!
Captain, look for Nicolosi

499
00:46:11,181 --> 00:46:15,220
and let the innocent people like me go free.
Go write it down! I'll sign everything!

500
00:46:15,382 --> 00:46:17,338
I won't keep anything back!

501
00:46:17,503 --> 00:46:21,655
So, after I'm done, can I go?
After I've signed the agreement?

502
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:25,979
I'm sorry Mr Marchica..

503
00:46:26,146 --> 00:46:29,741
I'm afraid that you'll have to stay away from
your home and friends a little while longer.

504
00:46:29,907 --> 00:46:33,946
Cut it out with this "Mr Marchica".
Zecchinetta's my name and I'm no "Mister".

505
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:36,703
Get a belt and thrash me!
Break my bones!

506
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:40,142
Anything but a "mister" and why don't you drop the formalities!

507
00:46:40,311 --> 00:46:42,745
Come on Sergeant! Don't think
about my pleurisy, just beat me!

508
00:46:42,912 --> 00:46:44,903
Don't tempt us!

509
00:46:46,673 --> 00:46:48,948
Read it and sign.

510
00:46:51,194 --> 00:46:55,426
You're cruel-hearted Captain.
Because I have a black mark against me

511
00:46:55,676 --> 00:46:58,031
everything that's happened with
Zecchinetta is my fault.

512
00:46:58,197 --> 00:47:00,950
But you're wrong.
I'm a gentleman.

513
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,678
I'm back on the right path.

514
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,553
And the names of those who saw
Colasberna and Rosa Nicolosi

515
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:13,316
doing their filth out in the field?
Don't you want to know?

516
00:47:13,922 --> 00:47:17,801
No. At the moment we're only
interested in knowing why

517
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:21,000
Pizzuco gave you 200,00 lira?
- Business!

518
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:27,794
Despicable! You're shameful Zecchinetta.
You took just 200,000 lira for two hits.

519
00:47:28,487 --> 00:47:32,544
Well, I'll go now Captain,
but I'll tell you - you're too arrogant!

520
00:47:32,622 --> 00:47:34,431
Too arrogant!

521
00:47:34,849 --> 00:47:36,282
Hey, does the Captain believe in God?

522
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,680
- Move it!
- So can I do it (pee) now?

523
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,806
Go on, move it!

524
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,851
What did he mean by 'arrogant'?

525
00:47:54,015 --> 00:47:56,973
An arrogant person is someone
that wants to know the truth.

526
00:47:58,057 --> 00:48:03,336
Balloons for sale!
100 lira for one!

527
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,327
- Good day Don Mariano
- Good day

528
00:48:19,344 --> 00:48:22,461
Don Mariano...may I have a word?

529
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:29,184
They put a bomb in the captain's car.
It's ready to explode.

530
00:48:31,788 --> 00:48:33,779
Which car is it?

531
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:36,988
And where's Pizzuco?

532
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,028
We went inside the bar
to wait for the fireworks.

533
00:48:49,114 --> 00:48:51,753
Greetings Don Mariano.

534
00:48:53,916 --> 00:48:56,635
And so, Don Pizzuco?

535
00:48:56,796 --> 00:48:59,390
You're doing things your own way now?
Without my permission?

536
00:48:59,557 --> 00:49:02,230
If Zecchinetta sings,
I'll be the first that goes down.

537
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:04,866
- Who took care of the job?
- The boys.

538
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,031
The captain..

539
00:49:19,244 --> 00:49:21,041
Toruzzo...

540
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:37,885
So you think that with the captain dead,
no one will question Zecchinetta any more?

541
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:41,645
That Captain's no good for us here.
If no one thinks to take him out,

542
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,609
then I will!

543
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,764
- You're without honour..
- Don Mariano!

544
00:49:46,933 --> 00:49:51,723
One who puts his friends and their
children in danger is a man without honour.

545
00:50:00,578 --> 00:50:04,093
Captain!
You've got a flat tyre, probably a nail.

546
00:50:13,622 --> 00:50:16,455
What a pity, it a new tyre as well...

547
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,305
We can fit the spare tyre for you?

548
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,581
No,  don't want to inconvenience you.
We have our own mechanic.

549
00:50:20,694 --> 00:50:23,301
It's Sunday today, let him rest!

550
00:50:23,465 --> 00:50:25,501
We can do it for you in two minutes captain!

551
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:29,659
- Go! Go! Go! Put the hand brake on.
- My respects captain!

552
00:50:29,828 --> 00:50:31,307
- Thanks.
- Can I get you a coffee?

553
00:50:31,468 --> 00:50:34,221
- Thanks, perhaps another time.
- With all my heart, ok!

554
00:50:39,151 --> 00:50:43,303
Now try to do what I tell you.
Today, you'll go and see Rosa Nicolosi.

555
00:50:43,472 --> 00:50:46,942
But why?
What does Rosa have to do with us?

556
00:50:48,594 --> 00:50:51,427
- I said that you must go to her house!
- And do what?

557
00:50:51,595 --> 00:50:54,712
That's up to you,
go to bed with her for all I care,

558
00:50:55,036 --> 00:50:58,426
but just stay there for a little while.
Nothing else. Understood?

559
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:05,511
- Thanks!
- Oh no, no!

560
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,716
- Your keys...
- What, are you joking?!

561
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,637
- God forbid, I wouldn't dream of it!
- Always at your service captain!

562
00:51:15,203 --> 00:51:20,596
- Those two are previous offenders Captain.
- C'mon Marshal! It's Sunday today.

563
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:43,044
We'll need to tell the mechanic to remove
the dynamite they've put in the car.

564
00:51:44,212 --> 00:51:47,204
Bastards!
I'll slap them straight inside!

565
00:51:47,374 --> 00:51:49,410
Calm down...

566
00:51:49,854 --> 00:51:55,008
Strange. First they rigged it but then
they changed their minds. Why?

567
00:51:58,017 --> 00:51:59,769
Maybe he'd be able to tell us.

568
00:51:59,938 --> 00:52:03,977
- You really believe that?
- Of course! Look at him, he stopped in front

569
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:08,134
of us on purpose. As if he wants us to
know or tell us something.

570
00:52:18,784 --> 00:52:22,618
Come on, why did you stop?
Are you an informer?

571
00:52:23,346 --> 00:52:26,224
Calm down, I can see you.
I can see you very well.

572
00:52:26,467 --> 00:52:30,202
But remember that it's me
who upholds the law here.

573
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:39,789
You going against me?
Then I accept your challenge.

574
00:52:44,593 --> 00:52:47,949
Understand? He's telling us
that he has powerful friends

575
00:52:48,114 --> 00:52:49,786
and that it's better to leave him alone.

576
00:52:49,954 --> 00:52:53,503
That's right.
What shall we do Captain?

577
00:52:54,396 --> 00:52:58,025
We need an answer.
We'll prepare a warrant.

578
00:52:58,197 --> 00:53:01,667
- For Don Mariano?
- No, not yet.

579
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:05,199
What are you doing Captain?
You're not starting it up are you!?

580
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,069
Don't worry, Don Mariano's
allowing us to live a bit more.

581
00:53:13,042 --> 00:53:14,953
Parineddu!

582
00:53:19,284 --> 00:53:21,002
My respects!

583
00:53:21,165 --> 00:53:24,077
Keep an eye on my friend
Pizzuco for me today.

584
00:53:24,286 --> 00:53:28,325
- And then?
- Nothing..just make note of it.

585
00:53:28,968 --> 00:53:31,084
- Good day, Don Mariano.
- Is the secretary in?

586
00:53:31,248 --> 00:53:32,601
- Yes.
- I'd like to speak to him.

587
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:35,078
At once, please do come in!

588
00:53:43,772 --> 00:53:45,410
Good day, Rosa!
May I?

589
00:53:45,573 --> 00:53:48,610
- Good day..
- Heh heh, what a beautiful, naked, young girl!.

590
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,333
Why are you hiding?

591
00:53:50,495 --> 00:53:53,805
- She's embarrassed.
- Wait, I'll help you!

592
00:53:54,936 --> 00:53:57,530
There! She looks like
a queen in a carriage!

593
00:53:58,177 --> 00:53:59,735
- There.
- There?    - Yes.

594
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:06,374
Here we go! You're not looking at me, eh?
There you are little one!

595
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,170
- Dry and dress yourself.
- You have a beautiful daughter!

596
00:54:10,341 --> 00:54:13,572
She'll be as pretty as you when she's older.
I remember you were just like that.

597
00:54:13,743 --> 00:54:17,053
- I watched you grow up Rosa.
- So, what did you want to tell me?

598
00:54:17,864 --> 00:54:22,858
I'll have a glass of wine, if that's ok?
I came to tell you that you're beautiful.

599
00:54:23,106 --> 00:54:24,698
Doesn't that please you?

600
00:54:24,866 --> 00:54:28,700
What do you mean?
Haven't you bought news of my husband?

601
00:54:28,868 --> 00:54:33,180
Don Mariano told me the other day:
"If I know something, I'll inform you"

602
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:38,469
- Ah, Don Mariano..and what else did he tell you?
- Not to worry..

603
00:54:39,111 --> 00:54:41,386
So don't worry.

604
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:49,385
- In that case, why did you come?
- Out of curiousity.

605
00:54:53,156 --> 00:54:57,461
Ah! Come here beautiful.
I have something for you, come!

606
00:54:59,718 --> 00:55:04,279
Come on, go outside to play, eh!
Bye..

607
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,996
Not too far!

608
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:21,034
[Sigh] You've ruined my life Rosa.
All those times that you passed in front

609
00:55:21,205 --> 00:55:27,396
of my house or when I'd meet you and
you'd look at me with those eyes. Y'know Rosa?

610
00:55:28,087 --> 00:55:30,681
Don't be a fool,
I've never once thought about you.

611
00:55:30,848 --> 00:55:33,487
That's what you say!

612
00:55:33,689 --> 00:55:35,858
Now that you've had
your drink, you can go.

613
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:41,083
- What a light dress you've got on..
- Your hand...Your hand!

614
00:55:58,858 --> 00:56:03,329
What did you think? You think
you can do that if I don't want it?

615
00:56:04,259 --> 00:56:06,955
Ah, take a walk! You'll just have
to make do with your whore of a wife!

616
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,495
Don't touch me with those
hands they make me sick!

617
00:56:10,008 --> 00:56:13,238
Think you can molest a woman?!
Get out!

618
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,865
Rosa, what's the matter?
You going to cry now?

619
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:46,111
So you came here just to
make yourself comfortable.

620
00:56:46,874 --> 00:56:49,434
And you're not afraid?

621
00:56:52,756 --> 00:56:54,906
You're not afraid that
my husband will find out?

622
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:00,354
Why aren't you afraid?

623
00:57:00,558 --> 00:57:03,516
Why?
You must tell me why!

624
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,717
Ehh! These Sicilian women!
Always so dramatic!

625
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:13,471
I want to move to Milan!
A breath of fresh air!

626
00:57:13,683 --> 00:57:16,228
Rosa, if you come with me,
I'll separate from my wife, eh?

627
00:57:16,249 --> 00:57:19,693
Will you come?...No?
Cheerio then!

628
00:57:43,613 --> 00:57:46,571
What're you all dong standing around?!

629
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:49,648
Is this how you earn
the money that I pay you?

630
00:57:53,176 --> 00:57:55,292
Ah, Captain!...

631
00:57:55,737 --> 00:57:58,615
May I offer you something?
A beer?

632
00:57:58,778 --> 00:58:01,451
Or some orangeade if you want?

633
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:07,657
Mr Pizzuco, you must come with us.
You're under arrest.

634
00:58:12,262 --> 00:58:17,620
Under arrest? If they've killed someone
between 3 and 4 (o'clock)

635
00:58:18,224 --> 00:58:22,695
I can tell you that I was at the house of a woman whose name

636
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,864
I won't mention...
unless it's absolutely necessary.

637
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:37,538
- Come on, give me your wrists.
- Sure, wait...just wait!...

638
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:41,268
- You want to resist?
- What's the rush? That I'm going to run away?

639
00:58:41,432 --> 00:58:45,789
- Control yourself, Pizzuco!
- Bravo, congratulations!

640
00:58:47,034 --> 00:58:50,663
It takes all these over-paid members of the State

641
00:58:50,835 --> 00:58:55,306
to arrest a decent man like me!
Poor Italian tax-payers!

642
00:58:57,277 --> 00:59:00,826
Take a good look,
my face doesn't have any scratches

643
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:04,968
and I'm in perfect health!
And I hope to be when they release me!

644
00:59:05,766 --> 00:59:09,474
Luigi, don't pay them for the time
they were standing around doing nothing!

645
00:59:14,683 --> 00:59:20,041
Inform my mother and tell her to go straight
to the lawyer! And you, wash my car!

646
00:59:21,085 --> 00:59:24,157
You wench!
They've arrested my son!

647
00:59:24,326 --> 00:59:28,842
They've arrested my innocent son!
We had to get a lawyer,

648
00:59:29,008 --> 00:59:32,444
so you need to pay me back
the money we spent, wench!

649
00:59:37,251 --> 00:59:40,561
So, write...
"A greengrocer"

650
00:59:40,772 --> 00:59:46,404
"A greengrocer buys five kilos.."

651
00:59:58,418 --> 01:00:00,010
- Rosa Nicolosi?
- Yes..

652
01:00:00,178 --> 01:00:02,418
- Are you the wife of Tano Nicolosi?
- Yes.

653
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,736
- Your husband sent me.
- Where is he?

654
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,910
- Palermo, he's working there.
- Palermo?

655
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:11,574
And he's left me here?
Without any word!?

656
01:00:11,822 --> 01:00:16,054
- Where's he working?
- I don't know. I met him in the pub.

657
01:00:16,224 --> 01:00:19,979
And when he found out that I usually
take this route he gave me this envelope.

658
01:00:20,265 --> 01:00:24,053
- Are you sure that it was him?
- If it wasn't him, he said that he was. And why?

659
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:40,223
- Not a single word?...
- There wasn't time, but he sent the money.

660
01:00:43,513 --> 01:00:45,549
Wait...

661
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,033
Is it him?

662
01:00:54,437 --> 01:01:00,353
- Yes, it's him.
- Where's he staying? The address?...

663
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:03,557
- He didn't give it to me.
- But didn't he say when he'll return?

664
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,836
He said he'd return as soon as he could..

665
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,640
..but with an expression as though
he was not able to. As if he was in hiding.

666
01:01:08,751 --> 01:01:12,557
Wait! Hey, wait!
Who is it that sent you?

667
01:01:12,963 --> 01:01:15,729
Careful, even though he's away,
if you don't behave like a wife he'll know.

668
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:17,881
Out the way!

669
01:01:20,845 --> 01:01:22,597
Caterina!

670
01:01:32,249 --> 01:01:35,594
<i>[Singing] Open up!
I don't want to stay in here!</i>

671
01:01:35,772 --> 01:01:38,183
<i>To me it seems like
you're taking advantage too much!</i>

672
01:01:38,371 --> 01:01:42,046
- What's going on Marshall?
- Zecchinetta's yelling that he wants to get out.

673
01:01:42,213 --> 01:01:44,320
He says that the number of days
that we're allowed to detain him are over.

674
01:01:44,337 --> 01:01:46,893
He says that it's his right to have
either an arrest warrant or freedom.

675
01:01:47,214 --> 01:01:49,853
- Captain, are we going to observe the law?
- Sergeant!

676
01:01:50,935 --> 01:01:53,813
Hand over Zecchinetta's
personal belongings and let him go.

677
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:57,013
Captain, do you really
want to let him go free?

678
01:01:57,618 --> 01:02:00,496
- Of course!
- Didn't the judge sign the arrest warrants?

679
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:03,856
I've got both of them in my pocket.
But Zecchinetta must enjoy a taste of freedom

680
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:05,838
and I want you to take him to the square.

681
01:02:05,858 --> 01:02:08,208
It's time to trick him and his friends.

682
01:02:08,421 --> 01:02:10,173
Get out.

683
01:02:12,143 --> 01:02:16,694
Sorry Captain! Me being released
must give you great pain!

684
01:02:17,784 --> 01:02:19,137
Who was it that you got yesterday?

685
01:03:16,164 --> 01:03:18,962
- My respects Don Vincenzo!
- Ah, so they released you Zecchinetta?

686
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:21,320
Hello my friend!
See you around.

687
01:03:21,486 --> 01:03:23,795
- Yeah, yeah see you later!
- Ignazio!

688
01:03:25,807 --> 01:03:28,002
- A nice sweet black coffee!
- At once.

689
01:03:40,492 --> 01:03:42,767
Did I leave the window open?

690
01:03:46,734 --> 01:03:51,091
Shall we have some fresh lemonade General?

691
01:03:51,576 --> 01:03:54,374
You wanted to know
who we arrested yesterday?

692
01:03:55,217 --> 01:03:58,766
- A dear friend, who you know very well.
- Me?

693
01:03:59,098 --> 01:04:04,616
Pizzuco. Look up at Don Mariano's
terrace..Pizzuco isn't there..

694
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:09,132
You know, he told us a
load of things about you...

695
01:04:09,302 --> 01:04:13,978
- About me?
- He says that you do whatever he wants.

696
01:04:18,185 --> 01:04:20,301
Your hand is shaking.

697
01:04:27,668 --> 01:04:31,263
Drink up..drink this coffee slowly
so that you'll remember it..

698
01:04:31,469 --> 01:04:34,448
They don't make it as
good as that in prison you know..

699
01:04:35,383 --> 01:04:37,774
You've gone all pale!

700
01:04:58,758 --> 01:05:01,716
Who played this trick on me?
Don Mariano?

701
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:12,601
- Damn cuckold!
- His mother, wife and sister...

702
01:05:12,923 --> 01:05:15,680
He'll pay for this with tears of blood!

703
01:05:16,417 --> 01:05:19,228
That great big cuckold..

704
01:05:48,615 --> 01:05:51,812
They make the 'horn' sign
and they're all happy.

705
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:05,939
- Marshal!
- Here!

706
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:08,979
Prepare a false confession from Pizzuco.

707
01:06:09,142 --> 01:06:11,292
It must say that it was
Zecchinetta who killed Colasberna.

708
01:06:11,463 --> 01:06:13,340
This confession has to be like a work of art!

709
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:16,176
Like an expose of the mafia code.

710
01:06:16,784 --> 01:06:20,493
A confession that when
Zecchinetta reads it, he feels betrayed.

711
01:06:20,946 --> 01:06:24,222
- And if Pizzuco confesses first?
- Let's hope not

712
01:06:24,387 --> 01:06:26,537
Zecchinetta goes down first.
Prepare the confession!

713
01:06:26,708 --> 01:06:28,938
- And the signature?
- You want to put a real signature

714
01:06:29,108 --> 01:06:31,542
in a false confession?
You sign it!

715
01:06:31,709 --> 01:06:34,985
It could be amusing for me,
I'm good at imitating handwriting!

716
01:06:35,151 --> 01:06:38,268
You'll see, it'll be a good job Captain.

717
01:06:38,472 --> 01:06:41,384
Yes, we should do it -
but without enjoying it too much

718
01:06:43,993 --> 01:06:46,871
..and at least with a little bit of disgust.

719
01:06:53,397 --> 01:06:55,786
Rosa, can we have a photo?

720
01:06:58,062 --> 01:06:59,788
Let's have one Rosa.

721
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,875
Come on, just one!

722
01:07:10,762 --> 01:07:13,322
Hi Annuzza, how are you..

723
01:07:17,565 --> 01:07:22,923
- Bless you, Don Mariano!
- I can wait, I don't want to rush you.

724
01:07:25,687 --> 01:07:28,963
- Here's to you, Don Mariano!
- Cheers..

725
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:36,004
Right, let's read all the bad news, eh!.

726
01:07:42,093 --> 01:07:44,561
It seems as though someone's looking for you.

727
01:07:44,734 --> 01:07:46,486
Who is it?

728
01:07:48,135 --> 01:07:51,127
Don Mariano, I'd like to
talk to you if you don't mind?

729
01:07:51,296 --> 01:07:55,528
- And who are you?
- Nicolosi's wife, don't you remember?

730
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:58,370
Rosa please, I'm trying to work here.

731
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,774
Excuse me
but can I speak to you alone?

732
01:08:05,941 --> 01:08:08,853
Alone?
You can't here...

733
01:08:10,022 --> 01:08:14,015
Tonight...when you're alone...
then I'll pay you a visit!

734
01:08:16,024 --> 01:08:19,061
You're provoking me girl,
what should I tell you?

735
01:08:21,126 --> 01:08:24,880
If it's so urgent, tell me!
Speak, we're among friends here.

736
01:08:26,808 --> 01:08:29,561
I heard that my husband is in Palermo.

737
01:08:29,729 --> 01:08:33,324
Someone on a motorbike
came and told me this morning.

738
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:38,847
Palermo? Good!
Beautiful city. Lucky him!

739
01:08:39,012 --> 01:08:43,881
Is he really in Palermo?
Is he in Palermo or here under the ground?!

740
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:47,409
You still insist on questioning
me where your husband is!

741
01:08:47,614 --> 01:08:49,983
What am I, your pimp!?

742
01:08:50,976 --> 01:08:55,527
No! No you are not my pimp!
I don't have a pimp!

743
01:08:55,897 --> 01:08:58,365
I have nothing to be ashamed of!

744
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:05,777
In Palermo it looks like they've
uncovered a house full of women,

745
01:09:06,821 --> 01:09:08,777
from the cellar, all the way up to the top floor.
Nice, eh?

746
01:09:08,942 --> 01:09:12,059
- We need to have one here too!
- But you have to find the goods first?

747
01:09:12,263 --> 01:09:15,380
There's some right there!

748
01:09:20,506 --> 01:09:22,576
What is it?
Are you offended?

749
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:26,784
Nobody asked you!

750
01:09:30,389 --> 01:09:32,698
The motorcycle was stolen.

751
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:41,152
A man that comes from Palermo
with a letter from your husband,

752
01:09:41,313 --> 01:09:44,783
isn't the type that arrives riding
a stolen motorcycle. Understand?

753
01:09:45,234 --> 01:09:48,704
A thief doesn't bring money to the
wife of a guy who is known at the pub.

754
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:50,672
If you follow?..

755
01:09:52,356 --> 01:09:55,075
So, it was faked then?

756
01:09:55,637 --> 01:09:58,470
Perhaps it's not even true that a
man brought money to the house?

757
01:09:58,638 --> 01:10:00,151
- What?
- Yes, come in.

758
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,671
Maybe you're lying to help someone?

759
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,796
What do you mean 'someone'?
And who should I help?

760
01:10:06,961 --> 01:10:09,998
Who can assure me that Don Mariano
didn't send you to purposely confuse things?

761
01:10:10,362 --> 01:10:13,195
So that's what you think?
Even though I came here?!

762
01:10:13,563 --> 01:10:17,158
Yes, but you also went to Don Mariano's.
And it wasn't to sell your eggs..

763
01:10:17,325 --> 01:10:20,601
But if it was your woman, wouldn't
you go to look and to ask someone?

764
01:10:20,766 --> 01:10:23,121
I'm doing it for my husband!

765
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:25,966
Just accept it,
they murdered him.

766
01:10:26,128 --> 01:10:28,847
Yes, the same way they killed Colasberna.

767
01:10:29,009 --> 01:10:32,285
He was too dangerous alive.
But they want us to believe he is alive.

768
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:34,920
And to save themselves,
they discredit you.

769
01:10:35,091 --> 01:10:37,789
At the moment they're coming up
with a false testimonies to make out

770
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:39,535
that you were Colasberna's lover.

771
01:10:40,052 --> 01:10:43,203
Yes, and sooner or later they'll have to judge them.

772
01:10:43,814 --> 01:10:47,853
I've only ever been with my husband.
No-one else has ever seen me naked!

773
01:10:48,015 --> 01:10:50,813
Ok, let's suppose that I'm mistaken,
and that he returns home..

774
01:10:50,976 --> 01:10:52,008
..and when he returns, what does he find?

775
01:10:52,672 --> 01:10:54,219
A person that decent women
don't stop to say hello to, someone

776
01:10:54,497 --> 01:10:58,695
that men stop on the street as if they
could take her to bed whenever they wanted!

777
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:01,168
Well it's better that he doesn't return then..

778
01:11:01,579 --> 01:11:03,139
Rosa, let these people hang!

779
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:06,203
Where do you think I live Captain?!
I live among these people,

780
01:11:06,204 --> 01:11:11,892
and when I walk past it's as if they're
undressing me with their eyes. I feel naked!

781
01:11:15,264 --> 01:11:22,246
When I tell you that eyewitnesses saw
Colasberna together with that woman..

782
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:28,648
..Rosa Nicolosi. It's a precise account
of which there cannot be any doubt about.

783
01:11:29,909 --> 01:11:33,362
Sure the cuckold - that is,
the husband, knew nothing..

784
01:11:33,739 --> 01:11:35,527
Either that or he pretended not to know anything.

785
01:11:36,231 --> 01:11:38,870
This is something you should investigate.

786
01:11:39,152 --> 01:11:42,269
So when the husband discovered them,
he killed Colasberna?

787
01:11:42,433 --> 01:11:44,708
- Exactly!
- Sit down!

788
01:11:44,874 --> 01:11:51,469
After being cuckolded don't you think
he'd have wanted to kill the wife before the lover?

789
01:11:52,316 --> 01:11:54,380
Perhaps he would?
If he's a man of honour he would..

790
01:11:55,108 --> 01:11:58,465
But if he's not a man of honour,
you should investigate this point too.

791
01:11:58,919 --> 01:12:01,692
So you're trying to tell me that the
deceased came down from heaven

792
01:12:01,885 --> 01:12:06,526
or from hell and killed his wife?
What a clown you are..

793
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:08,720
If he comes back,
he'll come back from Palermo

794
01:12:08,882 --> 01:12:11,715
you can't send money and
letters to the family from heaven!

795
01:12:11,883 --> 01:12:15,478
But I think that someone else sent that money to Rosa.

796
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:20,997
- Who's that?
- Someone's who's alive. You my dear!

797
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:22,724
- Me?
- Yes!

798
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:27,765
- I might have given her some money.
- Ah, you see!

799
01:12:28,809 --> 01:12:35,248
I bought her the money personally,
because I 'had' her in her house, if you will..

800
01:12:35,691 --> 01:12:39,445
So if you're Rosa's lover,
then you killed Colasberna

801
01:12:39,612 --> 01:12:43,730
out of jealousy and the husband
because he discovered you both.

802
01:12:43,894 --> 01:12:45,532
And Pizzuco ends up in jail.

803
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:47,669
Nonsense!
It can't be..

804
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,617
..because I was with her after
the murder and I also have the proof!

805
01:12:51,456 --> 01:12:56,325
She's a hot blooded woman, you don't know her.
She's money hungry, wants everything!

806
01:12:56,978 --> 01:13:00,830
But she has skin like velvet..

807
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:04,313
If I had the choice of how I wanted
to die I'd choose to die on top of her!

808
01:13:04,821 --> 01:13:09,201
Well done Rosa! You were Pizzuco's
lover and you didn't tell us a thing.

809
01:13:09,582 --> 01:13:13,291
- Lover? No. We'd just meet from time to time.
- They want to ruin me!

810
01:13:13,464 --> 01:13:15,842
In short Rosa, did you or didn't you
have a relationship with him? Yes or no?

811
01:13:16,028 --> 01:13:17,751
Of course not!
With someone like him!?

812
01:13:18,105 --> 01:13:22,815
- Then you were Colasberna's lover?
- No! No! No!

813
01:13:22,947 --> 01:13:27,936
But it's right that you believe them
more than me. He has powerful friends..

814
01:13:28,108 --> 01:13:29,097
..and I'm all alone.

815
01:13:29,269 --> 01:13:32,227
- Rosa, don't talk rubbish.
- Nah, I expected it..

816
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:35,462
..making a scene by crying.
Women are allowed to.

817
01:13:35,631 --> 01:13:37,861
And you..
Lies, right?

818
01:13:38,032 --> 01:13:40,182
- No.
- Sit down.

819
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:49,547
Instead, why don't you tell the
Captain who your husband worked for?

820
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:53,709
For me? For La Stella?
For Colosimo perhaps? Eh?

821
01:13:54,877 --> 01:13:56,549
I'll tell him who he worked for.

822
01:13:56,718 --> 01:13:59,471
No, I'll tell you.
Last year he worked for 120 days

823
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:02,836
in Colasberna's company.
Carry on, Pizzuco.

824
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,356
I'll continue. And why did he work for Colasberna?
Why, Rosa? Why?

825
01:14:06,681 --> 01:14:08,558
What does that mean?
So, you do business with Don Mariano

826
01:14:08,722 --> 01:14:11,441
because your wife is his mistress?

827
01:14:11,843 --> 01:14:13,401
Calm down!

828
01:14:14,804 --> 01:14:21,642
Damn it..Fine, I'm not going to
rise to her provocations.

829
01:14:21,806 --> 01:14:25,162
- Yes, you're a cuckold!
- It's useless to deny about us

830
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:29,321
I have witnesses.
Ask Parineddu, he knows everything.

831
01:14:29,489 --> 01:14:32,606
- He saw me at Rosa's house.
- No! It's not true!

832
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:35,000
It's not true that I was at your house?

833
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:39,289
- By tricking me!
- There! I knew it, now she's going to cry!

834
01:14:40,413 --> 01:14:44,033
- Go ahead Rosa.
- He came into my house by tricking me.

835
01:14:44,235 --> 01:14:45,235
Yeah, yeah.."tricks"!

836
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:47,689
He tried to take me by force but couldn't.

837
01:14:47,895 --> 01:14:52,923
I've only taken money from one
man in my life, and that's my husband!

838
01:14:54,017 --> 01:14:57,009
I'm his woman, and no-one elses!

839
01:14:57,178 --> 01:15:00,454
He received money from
Colasberna to turn a blind eye!

840
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:03,331
Give me back my husband!
What have you done to him?

841
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,776
If he's dead, you killed him!
If he's alive, you know where he is!

842
01:15:06,942 --> 01:15:08,614
Pizzuco...

843
01:15:09,062 --> 01:15:10,859
- Lower your voice.
- Yeah, ok..

844
01:15:13,864 --> 01:15:16,662
And Zecchinetta?
What can you tell me about Zecchinetta?

845
01:15:16,865 --> 01:15:23,418
Listen Captain. You bring me
Nicolosi's body here and then we'll talk.

846
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:40,219
Rosa, why didn't you tell me that
your husband worked for Colasberna?

847
01:15:40,393 --> 01:15:43,544
You understand that these are facts that can go against you?

848
01:15:44,034 --> 01:15:49,188
That's their business.
It's up to the man to say what to do.

849
01:15:49,356 --> 01:15:52,154
The woman must always keep her mouth shut!

850
01:15:52,477 --> 01:15:55,684
Be careful Rosa!
Because as a result of denying everything,

851
01:15:55,884 --> 01:16:00,118
and remaining silent, you could end
up laying all the blame on others.

852
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:05,158
Go on. The morning that Colaberna
was killed, tell me what happened?

853
01:16:05,321 --> 01:16:09,917
Captain, I swear on my daughter's head
that Colasberna never touched me!

854
01:16:10,323 --> 01:16:12,279
I know!
I know this!

855
01:16:14,004 --> 01:16:17,055
What I want to know is,
what did your husband do after?

856
01:16:17,232 --> 01:16:19,458
Where did he go?

857
01:16:26,768 --> 01:16:30,568
He didn't tell me.
He didn't tell me...

858
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:35,824
Ok Rosa, so what shall we do?
Now you can go home and

859
01:16:36,011 --> 01:16:37,961
write me a nice anonymous letter?

860
01:16:39,092 --> 01:16:40,241
Me?

861
01:16:40,533 --> 01:16:43,570
Yes. You can try and
tell me the truth this way.

862
01:16:43,734 --> 01:16:51,165
Listen, I've never done anything like that.
And plus I've already told you the truth.

863
01:16:53,057 --> 01:16:55,810
- Marshal!
- Yes sir?

864
01:16:57,178 --> 01:17:01,569
- You can go now. How's it going?
- He's a tough nut to crack.

865
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,492
Keep at him,
and don't let him sleep.

866
01:17:03,821 --> 01:17:05,539
And tell...
Parineddu

867
01:17:05,701 --> 01:17:07,931
that I want to see him here in town tomorrow.

868
01:17:08,542 --> 01:17:11,215
Ah..and Zecchinetta in my office, now.

869
01:17:11,383 --> 01:17:14,773
Wait a while and then show
him Pizzuco's false confession.

870
01:17:17,665 --> 01:17:20,614
You seem to know everyone,
take a little look at that distinguished gentleman

871
01:17:20,805 --> 01:17:23,672
who's chatting with Don Mariano.
It's not a new face is it?

872
01:17:24,508 --> 01:17:26,260
No..I don't know him.

873
01:17:26,948 --> 01:17:29,985
But come on, that's Minister Botta.
He's a part of the puzzle.

874
01:17:30,149 --> 01:17:31,468
Which 'puzzle'?

875
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:35,384
He is the link that joins Don Mariano
and Honourable Minister Passarella.

876
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:38,668
Captain, I don't know him.
I've never seen him before.

877
01:17:38,832 --> 01:17:43,064
Captain...Pizzuco!

878
01:17:45,194 --> 01:17:48,470
- Sit down!
- A signed confession.

879
01:17:53,597 --> 01:17:56,987
You've been done!
Pizzuco accuses you of killing Colasberna!

880
01:17:57,158 --> 01:18:02,232
- Me?! And on whose behalf?
- On your own initiative.

881
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,435
Pizzuco said he confided in you how Colasberna had offended him

882
01:18:06,602 --> 01:18:08,797
And that you offered to avenge him.

883
01:18:08,962 --> 01:18:11,920
But Pizzuco, a man of principle
and opposed to violence, refused.

884
01:18:12,764 --> 01:18:14,880
But you went ahead and
killed Colasberna all the same.

885
01:18:15,084 --> 01:18:18,042
Me? In that case I'm crazy then?!

886
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:21,876
You killed him because you owed Pizzuco
the 200,000 lira you lost to him in a game.

887
01:18:22,247 --> 01:18:25,444
Pizzuco claims that
after meeting him, you said:

888
01:18:25,768 --> 01:18:28,885
<i>"Partivu pe astutarinni unu,
e mi tuccò astutarinni dui"</i>

889
01:18:29,049 --> 01:18:30,277
Which means:

890
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:33,681
"I set out to kill one but I had to kill two"

891
01:18:33,851 --> 01:18:37,048
- Two?
- Colasberna, and Nicolosi because he saw you.

892
01:18:38,932 --> 01:18:42,527
Nicolosi? And where's his body?!
Did I eat it?!!

893
01:18:42,694 --> 01:18:45,254
Or buried. There's a lot of land out there!

894
01:18:45,615 --> 01:18:50,166
And the rifle? Where did I hide it?
In the....Rosa?

895
01:18:50,416 --> 01:18:52,884
Read it.
Read it if you don't believe.

896
01:18:57,579 --> 01:18:59,092
Bastard!

897
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:07,500
Eat!..Eat up but don't rush,
your friend Pizzuco signed two of them.

898
01:19:10,343 --> 01:19:13,380
Don Mariano and Pizzuco
are sending you to jail!

899
01:19:13,544 --> 01:19:17,173
To think that if you'd just talk,
it would be them going to prison instead.

900
01:19:26,989 --> 01:19:30,026
Write!
I'll talk now!

901
01:19:31,110 --> 01:19:33,401
So, who gave you the order?
Don Mariano?

902
01:19:33,556 --> 01:19:35,912
And stop defending him as if he was God Almighty!

903
01:19:36,177 --> 01:19:38,821
Don Mariano's got nothing to do with it.
Pizzuco is the one!

904
01:19:44,995 --> 01:19:48,146
- Pizzuco has called you to testify.
- Me?

905
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:51,467
He says that you saw him at Rosa
Nicolosi's house and wants you to confirm it.

906
01:19:52,917 --> 01:19:54,635
What happened at Rosa's house?

907
01:19:54,838 --> 01:19:57,636
He forced himself upon her.
I saw him from outside.

908
01:19:58,519 --> 01:20:00,794
- And her?
- She was willing enough.

909
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,878
- Are you sure?
- That's how it seemed to me.

910
01:20:04,201 --> 01:20:05,634
That's how it seemed,
or that's how it was?

911
01:20:05,802 --> 01:20:08,999
If I say that Rosa wasn't willing,
they'll want me dead!

912
01:20:09,163 --> 01:20:11,313
But I want to save you.

913
01:20:16,805 --> 01:20:20,436
Well, you go ahead with what
they've told you to say about Rosa.

914
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:22,979
..but in exchange,
I want something from you.

915
01:20:23,888 --> 01:20:27,324
- What's that?
- You have to help me arrest Don Mariano.

916
01:20:27,569 --> 01:20:30,596
No, Captain. I don't know
anything about Don Mariano.

917
01:20:30,773 --> 01:20:32,419
I can't help you with this.

918
01:20:33,251 --> 01:20:37,005
If you testify against Rosa,
I'll testify against you.

919
01:20:37,172 --> 01:20:39,606
I'll fry you!
How long will you last after that?

920
01:20:39,773 --> 01:20:43,368
But I don't know anything about
Don Mariano. I'd tell you if I did.

921
01:20:44,334 --> 01:20:45,562
I don't believe you.

922
01:20:45,735 --> 01:20:48,772
I always thought that you knew a lot
about Don Mariano but you keep it hush hush.

923
01:20:49,096 --> 01:20:52,771
Enough playing both sides Parineddu!
It's us who pay you, not them.

924
01:20:52,937 --> 01:20:55,212
- I don't want it!
- Don't talk rubbish.

925
01:20:56,098 --> 01:20:59,408
Afterwards, Zecchinetta took
the rifle to Don Mariano's house.

926
01:21:02,861 --> 01:21:05,421
- Did you see him?
- I live near him.

927
01:21:05,822 --> 01:21:09,656
- And why to Don Mariano's?
- Because it's the safest place.

928
01:21:10,343 --> 01:21:14,495
- You have to testify.
- Me!? Captain, our deal?

929
01:21:17,265 --> 01:21:19,779
No court, you said!

930
01:21:19,946 --> 01:21:21,777
That doesn't count anymore.

931
01:21:21,947 --> 01:21:24,859
Don Mariano doesn't go back on his word.

932
01:21:25,948 --> 01:21:27,779
I want him in front of the judge

933
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:31,305
and I don't want to hear
anything about lack of evidence.

934
01:21:52,837 --> 01:21:56,796
- Pizzuco!
- Zecchinetta! You bastard!

935
01:21:56,959 --> 01:21:59,996
You'll end up worse than Colasberna.
Much worse!

936
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,079
Pizzuco!
You should be a singer! A singer!

937
01:22:04,481 --> 01:22:10,590
- They should cut out your tongue! Lowlife!
- Bastard! Informer! You're a cop!

938
01:22:11,203 --> 01:22:13,159
You're the bloody spy!

939
01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:19,674
Good day Captain.
Pizzuco has confessed

940
01:22:19,846 --> 01:22:22,997
but it took all night to get him to sign!

941
01:22:23,167 --> 01:22:27,797
Naturally, not a single word about Don Mariano
though. The saints are untouchable!

942
01:22:27,969 --> 01:22:30,199
If you'll allow me Captain,
I'm going to get some sleep.

943
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:31,940
There's something urgent that needs doing.

944
01:22:32,116 --> 01:22:34,374
After that I'll leave you to
sleep even for 24 hours.

945
01:22:36,292 --> 01:22:39,807
Get the men,
we're going to touch those Saints!

946
01:22:40,093 --> 01:22:43,369
- But do we have the proof against him Captain?
- Yes.

947
01:22:43,534 --> 01:22:46,412
Can't we put it off until tomorrow?
His Excellence Passarella arrives today,

948
01:22:46,575 --> 01:22:49,533
to help him to inaugurate the new road.

949
01:22:49,696 --> 01:22:52,002
No. His Excellence Passarella will unveil the road

950
01:22:52,192 --> 01:22:54,184
without having to stand next to that big shot.

951
01:22:54,418 --> 01:22:59,128
The man who builds with manure and blood!
For the prestige of the State

952
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:03,810
he must do it knowing that Don Mariano
is incarcerated and accused of murder.

953
01:23:04,381 --> 01:23:07,373
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

954
01:23:07,982 --> 01:23:11,657
The Carabinieri are here?
But what for? What's happened?

955
01:23:16,745 --> 01:23:18,292
- Destroy it at once!
- What's happening?

956
01:23:18,453 --> 01:23:20,486
Tell me, please, I want to know!
I want to know!

957
01:23:20,707 --> 01:23:25,064
Tomorrow you'll leave for Switzerland.
And whatever you read in the newspapers

958
01:23:25,228 --> 01:23:28,857
about me, it's not true.
Understand? Go on, go!

959
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:32,026
- What's happening?
- Calm down! Calm down!

960
01:23:32,191 --> 01:23:35,581
- But sir! Only honourable people live here!
- Go and stay in the kitchen.

961
01:23:35,992 --> 01:23:38,586
But if I woke you up at this hour
then there must be a reason, no?

962
01:23:38,753 --> 01:23:42,428
Sure! Alert our friends.
Wake up the ministers in Rome!

963
01:23:42,594 --> 01:23:44,630
Tell everyone!
One moment!..

964
01:23:45,519 --> 01:23:50,752
Please! And to what pleasure do
I owe this visit at such an early hour?

965
01:23:51,237 --> 01:23:54,388
If you cast your mind back to your youth,
you'll recall that this is the time when

966
01:23:54,558 --> 01:23:59,910
the Carabinieri make their visit
when they want to arrest someone.

967
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:05,075
The search has already begun
and it won't be long until the handcuffs.

968
01:24:11,084 --> 01:24:13,075
Hah, they came to arrest me!

969
01:24:16,245 --> 01:24:19,794
Give it to me.
These are my savings.

970
01:24:20,087 --> 01:24:24,034
The dates of your deposits coincide
exactly with the dates of the public works.

971
01:24:24,368 --> 01:24:28,884
Public works? I'm a land-owner.
I lent some money to friends

972
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:30,722
and they paid it back to me.

973
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:36,489
-  You've no part in the construction companies then?
- No, no...not at all.

974
01:24:37,332 --> 01:24:40,210
Many companies have
obtained contracts by illegal means

975
01:24:40,373 --> 01:24:43,763
thanks to your recommendations.
- I do thousands of them.

976
01:24:45,015 --> 01:24:48,849
Contracts, licences,
sites, subsidies...

977
01:24:49,136 --> 01:24:53,687
- So who do you give them to?
- My friends who are able to do things.

978
01:24:53,858 --> 01:24:55,610
Who usually?

979
01:24:57,299 --> 01:25:00,211
Whoever shows themselves to be the best friend.

980
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:04,892
- And what do you get out of them?
- Friendship.

981
01:25:10,864 --> 01:25:12,695
Look!

982
01:25:16,305 --> 01:25:18,421
So it seems as though you're
not worried about taxes then?

983
01:25:18,586 --> 01:25:23,341
I'm not worried about anything.
I'm ignorant, I only know a few things.

984
01:25:24,308 --> 01:25:26,212
For example, I know that under
the nose we have a mouth

985
01:25:26,417 --> 01:25:29,264
which is more for eating
...than for talking.

986
01:25:32,071 --> 01:25:36,986
I also have a mouth under my nose,
even if it only eats government bread.

987
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:41,387
I know...
But you're a man.

988
01:25:48,116 --> 01:25:50,311
They say you're religious..

989
01:25:50,597 --> 01:25:54,670
Well..I go to church every Sunday.
I donate to charity.

990
01:25:55,038 --> 01:25:58,155
- Do you think that's enough?
- Why wouldn't it be?

991
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:04,559
The church is huge. Everyone
does things their own way in there.

992
01:26:04,722 --> 01:26:06,394
Laura, the coffee!

993
01:26:06,562 --> 01:26:09,030
And what do you think of the Gospel?

994
01:26:09,483 --> 01:26:13,920
Ahh..beautiful words!
The church is all beauty.

995
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:17,122
Do you think it's right to kill a man?

996
01:26:18,566 --> 01:26:21,717
I've never done anything of the sort.

997
01:26:22,848 --> 01:26:28,445
But if you're asking me, theoretically,
it would depend on who the man is.

998
01:26:28,930 --> 01:26:31,888
Ah, so according to you,
there is man and man?

999
01:26:32,691 --> 01:26:36,127
I divide humanity into five categories:

1000
01:26:38,373 --> 01:26:43,044
There are the real men,
the half men, the so-so men...

1001
01:26:43,685 --> 01:26:47,029
and then, if you'll excuse me, the faggots..

1002
01:26:47,143 --> 01:26:51,973
...and finally, it's like as if they didn't exist,
the gossips who are worth nothing!

1003
01:26:53,058 --> 01:26:56,095
There are very few real men,
only a few half men

1004
01:26:56,659 --> 01:27:01,255
The majority of men are so-so.
They're like kids who think they're grown-ups

1005
01:27:02,461 --> 01:27:07,660
As for the queers, they're
growing to become a real army.

1006
01:27:09,103 --> 01:27:12,379
And lastly, the blabbermouths...

1007
01:27:13,024 --> 01:27:15,333
A flock of geese.

1008
01:27:15,585 --> 01:27:18,657
But, even if you nailed me,
you're a man!

1009
01:27:18,826 --> 01:27:20,782
And why do you
consider me to be a man?

1010
01:27:23,708 --> 01:27:28,623
Because someone in your place
can trample over people easily.

1011
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:34,183
And I received insults far worse
than death from your predecessors.

1012
01:27:35,592 --> 01:27:42,430
They slapped me.
Another put his cigarette out on my hand

1013
01:27:43,195 --> 01:27:45,663
and how he laughed!

1014
01:27:47,276 --> 01:27:51,269
Can you sleep when
you've been ridiculed like that?

1015
01:27:52,118 --> 01:27:56,828
- So, I don't offend you then?
- No, you're a man.

1016
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:03,116
You too, Don Mariano.
But I'll still have to send you to jail.

1017
01:28:05,682 --> 01:28:09,118
- Why didn't you arrest me before?
- I didn't have the proof.

1018
01:28:09,283 --> 01:28:12,161
Proof? With or without proof,
it's the same thing!

1019
01:28:12,324 --> 01:28:16,715
Captain, we found this weapon inside a cupboard.

1020
01:28:18,686 --> 01:28:21,598
The proof!
You're a magician!

1021
01:28:25,489 --> 01:28:31,007
- This rifle has killed at least two men.
- More than that. It's 40 years old!

1022
01:28:31,211 --> 01:28:34,203
But the last were
Colasberna and Nicolosi.

1023
01:28:34,372 --> 01:28:37,485
I bought it from a 'picciotto'
(lowest level of mafia hierarchy)

1024
01:28:37,506 --> 01:28:39,728
From who?
From Zecchinetta?

1025
01:28:41,174 --> 01:28:45,850
- Yes, I think so. That was his name.
- But you bought it the morning of the crime,

1026
01:28:46,016 --> 01:28:48,450
while it was still hot,
and you didn't pay for it.

1027
01:28:48,616 --> 01:28:50,065
Because Zecchinetta,
who also talks a lot

1028
01:28:50,329 --> 01:28:53,847
never said a word about
receiving money for the weapon.

1029
01:28:54,258 --> 01:28:58,217
So can you explain to me why,
if I'm so sly and powerful as you say

1030
01:28:59,180 --> 01:29:01,853
I would keep the murder weapon in my house?

1031
01:29:02,021 --> 01:29:04,819
Because you're so sure of yourself
that you never thought that someone

1032
01:29:04,982 --> 01:29:07,257
would come and search your home.

1033
01:29:12,824 --> 01:29:17,375
Mariano Arena, in the name of the law,
I declare you under arrest.

1034
01:29:17,546 --> 01:29:21,716
You're accused of being behind the murders
of Salvatore Colasberna and Gaetano Nicolosi.

1035
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:33,139
- Look, Don Mariano!
- Don Mariano!

1036
01:29:51,918 --> 01:29:55,720
Don Mariano, I swear to you, neither I
nor Zecchinetta mentioned your name.

1037
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:59,032
We were fighting between ourselves like two cocks.

1038
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,272
- Have you signed anything?
- Yes.

1039
01:30:06,202 --> 01:30:08,921
Idiots!
You deserve to end up here.

1040
01:30:12,164 --> 01:30:15,679
Bang your head against here
and dont stop until I say...

1041
01:30:29,410 --> 01:30:31,560
I said bang it.
Bang it!

1042
01:30:45,055 --> 01:30:46,932
Again!

1043
01:30:55,179 --> 01:30:58,091
- What did you do to your forehead?
- I fell.

1044
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,933
Don't you think about saying
that it was us who beat you!

1045
01:31:01,301 --> 01:31:03,257
No, I fell!

1046
01:31:07,783 --> 01:31:11,536
Long live Monsignor!
Long live Monsignor!

1047
01:31:17,466 --> 01:31:19,263
Take the cuffs off.

1048
01:31:23,987 --> 01:31:28,692
<i>Salutai i parenti e gli amici..</i>

1049
01:31:29,228 --> 01:31:36,728
<i>..e pure una vecchiarella...</i>

1050
01:31:39,067 --> 01:31:45,672
<i>Un pezzo da novanta portarono!
Un pezzo da novanta!</i>

1051
01:31:48,236 --> 01:31:51,114
Rosa!
This way! This way!

1052
01:32:04,002 --> 01:32:08,518
Sit here and eat this roll.

1053
01:32:22,248 --> 01:32:26,560
Sit down Rosa.
Sit, don't be scared.

1054
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:00,014
Have you received news of your husband?

1055
01:33:02,581 --> 01:33:05,015
Sometimes husbands can go crazy.

1056
01:33:05,182 --> 01:33:09,380
They run off and leave their wife and kids.
To Tunisia, to America..

1057
01:33:09,544 --> 01:33:11,216
- To Milan
- To France

1058
01:33:11,384 --> 01:33:12,863
- To Switzerland
- Or to Germany..

1059
01:33:13,025 --> 01:33:16,574
Do you need help Rosa?
Don't worry

1060
01:33:16,946 --> 01:33:21,895
we'll take care of you and your
child until your husband returns.

1061
01:33:23,188 --> 01:33:26,225
And if he doesn't come back, you won't be left abandoned

1062
01:33:26,389 --> 01:33:29,222
and no one will treat you with disrespect.

1063
01:33:30,031 --> 01:33:33,626
Are we agreed?
No one will treat her with direspect.

1064
01:33:33,792 --> 01:33:36,963
Even though you didn't show respect to someone.

1065
01:33:36,974 --> 01:33:39,904
Someone who didn't do anything to you.

1066
01:33:40,714 --> 01:33:46,630
But Don Mariano is a good man,
who'll forgive and forget a fit of desperation.

1067
01:33:46,916 --> 01:33:49,350
He knows that you're a good woman.

1068
01:33:49,517 --> 01:33:53,874
Rosa said some things that were wrong and untrue!

1069
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:57,754
Yes, she said them - but in good faith
without understanding the consequences.

1070
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:01,748
When Rosa said "zecchinetta",
she wanted to say that that night

1071
01:34:01,921 --> 01:34:06,233
her husband came back late,
because he went to play cards.

1072
01:34:06,403 --> 01:34:08,439
- It was a misunderstanding!
- A misunderstanding, exactly!

1073
01:34:08,603 --> 01:34:13,631
He never met Zecchinetta!
He went to play 'zecchinetta', the card game.

1074
01:34:14,685 --> 01:34:19,042
A card game.
But the captain took it another way.

1075
01:34:19,207 --> 01:34:20,959
Of course, how could he have known?

1076
01:34:22,088 --> 01:34:26,639
The captain is from the north.
He doesn't know us.

1077
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:32,040
They distorted it all.
Don't you agree Rosa?

1078
01:34:34,532 --> 01:34:38,652
I'll ask my husband how I need to act when he returns!

1079
01:34:54,099 --> 01:34:56,567
Tomorrow I'm going to tell the truth to the judge.

1080
01:34:56,940 --> 01:35:02,492
That when they killed Colasberna,
Zecchinetta was watering my land.

1081
01:35:03,182 --> 01:35:06,492
If he was working 70 kilometres
from your house, Rosa

1082
01:35:06,663 --> 01:35:09,735
how could he be guilty of the crime?

1083
01:35:09,904 --> 01:35:12,418
Sure! Sure! My cousin can testify to it too.

1084
01:35:12,745 --> 01:35:16,454
It's a disgrace that the gentlemen are in prison.

1085
01:35:16,826 --> 01:35:18,464
They'll get out.
They'll get out.

1086
01:35:18,827 --> 01:35:23,423
And you, if you don't tell the truth,
they'll say you did it to cause harm.

1087
01:35:23,709 --> 01:35:31,059
Out of bitterness. Is that nice?
No, it's not - nor is it fair.

1088
01:35:32,832 --> 01:35:34,982
Do you agree Rosa?

1089
01:35:35,152 --> 01:35:37,791
This dish is too salty.

1090
01:35:40,194 --> 01:35:43,823
Rosa, what are you doing?
You're leaving? Where are you going?

1091
01:35:45,636 --> 01:35:47,238
Where am I going?

1092
01:35:47,555 --> 01:35:51,968
It's just that I'm ashamed of
this dress and these bare arms.

1093
01:35:53,278 --> 01:35:57,237
I'm in mourning aren't I?
So I should dress in mourning.

1094
01:36:09,084 --> 01:36:11,439
- Who is it?
- Rosa Nicolosi.

1095
01:36:13,405 --> 01:36:18,815
- That morning...
- No come on, Rosa. Enter!

1096
01:36:19,136 --> 01:36:20,136
Tell me.

1097
01:36:30,171 --> 01:36:35,370
- So, that morning?
- That morning Pizzuco called my husband

1098
01:36:35,533 --> 01:36:39,455
for work he said. My husband
went and I never saw him again.

1099
01:36:41,735 --> 01:36:44,488
We haven't stopped looking for him.

1100
01:36:45,096 --> 01:36:47,894
Look at these glasses,
they were found at Pizzuco's site.

1101
01:36:48,217 --> 01:36:51,448
None of the workers there recognise them.
Are they your husband's?

1102
01:36:51,618 --> 01:36:56,487
- I...I don't know.
- Didn't he use sunglasses?

1103
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:00,528
Yes, but I don't know if it's them.
You must believe me,

1104
01:37:00,662 --> 01:37:02,934
I can tell you the
truth in here and I've told you!

1105
01:37:03,262 --> 01:37:06,811
What you say inside here is useless
if you won't repeat it outside!

1106
01:37:07,343 --> 01:37:10,494
No! I came to tell you
but I won't testify outside.

1107
01:37:11,024 --> 01:37:13,663
You won't speak in front of the judges, correct?

1108
01:37:13,825 --> 01:37:15,941
I have to think about my daughter.

1109
01:37:16,266 --> 01:37:19,064
You know what they're saying here?
They say my investigations is just

1110
01:37:19,227 --> 01:37:22,378
a political campaign to sling
mud at certain big shots in Rome!

1111
01:37:22,548 --> 01:37:26,302
That the confessions where forced!
That Don Mariano was a victim!

1112
01:37:27,190 --> 01:37:29,499
They say that I've blamed an honest man
and that I deliberately ignored to

1113
01:37:29,711 --> 01:37:33,989
investigate the crime of passion!
Do you understand!?

1114
01:37:34,712 --> 01:37:38,421
I'm saving you from ruin!
And what are you doing for me?

1115
01:37:39,714 --> 01:37:42,831
- I did what I could.
- No! Like the others,

1116
01:37:42,995 --> 01:37:47,352
you did what I told you to do!
You did nothing of your own will!

1117
01:37:53,999 --> 01:37:57,389
But I still managed all the same.
Even though I only got

1118
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:00,154
silence from all of you instead of help.

1119
01:38:02,682 --> 01:38:04,877
Well, what is it Rosa?

1120
01:38:09,084 --> 01:38:14,556
Are you also thinking that I'm,
as all the others say, 'arrogant'?

1121
01:38:21,088 --> 01:38:23,318
Go on, say it!

1122
01:38:24,609 --> 01:38:28,568
What do I know?
Who knows you?

1123
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:55,129
<i>"At the inauguration above the
authorities, the dead underneath"</i>

1124
01:39:21,068 --> 01:39:23,866
- Captain Bellodi!
- You can't pass.

1125
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:26,766
Let me through!
Captain Bellodi!

1126
01:39:30,631 --> 01:39:33,270
Captain, do you want a drink?

1127
01:39:39,554 --> 01:39:43,433
- What are you doing, you pulling it all up?
- Piece by piece. Everything.

1128
01:39:43,595 --> 01:39:45,551
And who'll pay for it?

1129
01:40:07,964 --> 01:40:09,397
Corporal!

1130
01:40:12,845 --> 01:40:15,484
Come here!
Come, we've found him!

1131
01:40:15,886 --> 01:40:19,037
- Captain, here!
- Let the Captain through!

1132
01:40:32,852 --> 01:40:34,763
Come on, hurry!

1133
01:40:36,693 --> 01:40:38,714
- Who is it?
- It's who they were searching for..

1134
01:40:38,903 --> 01:40:42,256
Rosa Nicolosi's husband.
The one they couldn't find.

1135
01:40:46,256 --> 01:40:48,247
Come on, turn him over!

1136
01:40:53,179 --> 01:40:56,535
- Parineddu!
- It's Parineddu!

1137
01:41:03,222 --> 01:41:05,213
Remove that cork from his mouth.

1138
01:41:09,744 --> 01:41:14,499
That letter Captain...you get it?
It's them who sent it.

1139
01:41:26,830 --> 01:41:33,383
Masons, builders,
carpenters, labourers, unemployed!

1140
01:41:33,752 --> 01:41:39,270
Bring yourselves to the housing projects!

1141
01:41:39,834 --> 01:41:42,553
Bless you Don Mariano!

1142
01:41:46,837 --> 01:41:48,395
My respects Don Mariano!

1143
01:41:48,637 --> 01:41:55,634
Don Mariano Arena is back!
He's a good Christian!

1144
01:42:00,041 --> 01:42:03,920
Santuzza! Bring me the
binoculars from the writing desk.

1145
01:42:05,010 --> 01:42:09,558
The air in Palermo didn't do me good.
It made me heavy and nauseous.

1146
01:42:10,885 --> 01:42:12,841
My head always felt heavy.

1147
01:42:13,206 --> 01:42:15,879
Have you read? They arrested
the director of Banco Provinciale.

1148
01:42:16,046 --> 01:42:18,196
Why did they arrest him?
He was a good man.

1149
01:42:18,367 --> 01:42:21,677
That's why they arrested him.
Because he was a good man, of course!

1150
01:42:22,689 --> 01:42:26,921
He'll get out. He'll get out soon enough!
We got out too didn't we!?

1151
01:42:28,131 --> 01:42:30,804
You can speak when the hen pisses!
(i.e. Shut up!)

1152
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:58,570
There's a new captain.

1153
01:42:58,741 --> 01:43:00,140
Give it to me.

1154
01:43:03,342 --> 01:43:06,857
He has a likeable face.
Take it!

1155
01:43:13,186 --> 01:43:17,338
You're right, like a father.

1156
01:43:24,269 --> 01:43:27,181
I bet he's got a wife and kids.

1157
01:43:30,351 --> 01:43:34,947
Even better if he has a big family,
he'll take care of his own business.

1158
01:43:35,353 --> 01:43:39,471
- He'll always be a carabiniere.
- Like Bellodi.

1159
01:43:40,195 --> 01:43:42,151
Bellodi was a man.

1160
01:43:43,316 --> 01:43:45,784
This one's a blabbermouth.

1161
01:43:46,117 --> 01:43:48,711
- Blabbermouth!
- Blabbermouth...
