1
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,133
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,467
(intense rock music)

3
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:22,233
(suspenseful music)

4
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:58,267
[Ninjas] Master.

5
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,133
We have finished the mission.

6
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:06,133
Right, well done everyone.

7
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:08,967
The traitor has
been eliminated.

8
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:13,733
Traitors must die.

9
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:31,767
To live the life of a ninja

10
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:34,167
is a sacred way to live.

11
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:38,333
When we take up the mission,
we must succeed or die.

12
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,700
[Ninjas] Born a
ninja, die a ninja.

13
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:47,200
(dramatic music)

14
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,767
Good morning, everybody.

15
00:05:04,133 --> 00:05:06,067
This special unit
has been formed

16
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:10,867
to investigate an international
forgery operation.

17
00:05:10,867 --> 00:05:14,733
Interpol wants us to find out
where the money's coming from.

18
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:17,967
We've made a few arrests,
but they're only small fry.

19
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,667
Most of them posed as tourists

20
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:22,300
and passed the notes
in shops and hotels.

21
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,100
Circulation of the
money's increasing.

22
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,333
Well, we have some leads.

23
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,833
This is Bruce,
he's their leader.

24
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:42,267
And Four Eyes, their broker.

25
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:44,767
His name's Albert.

26
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,800
And a woman, Susan,
their organizer.

27
00:06:16,567 --> 00:06:18,567
They do all the
real monky business.

28
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,533
They bring in the
money for the gang.

29
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:22,400
Four Eyes is a powerful man.

30
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,067
Susan also runs a training
school for models.

31
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:28,300
This is Warren,
our contact man.

32
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,967
He's undercover now.

33
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,533
Andy, John, and myself
will take care of Bruce.

34
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:38,700
The rest of you will
work with Warren.

35
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:55,567
This is Four Eyes'
girlfriend, Lily.

36
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:00,833
Susan's brother David is a
playboy and a troublemaker.

37
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,433
Hi there.

38
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,533
I'm sorry, I just
borrowed your bike.

39
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,400
You did?

40
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,500
(laughs)

41
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:25,067
Why didn't you ask?

42
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:25,833
I...

43
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,433
Well, you weren't around.

44
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:30,367
Bullshit.

45
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,367
Listen, I'm warning you.

46
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:36,867
That bike's like my girl.

47
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:39,300
Nobody can touch it.

48
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,067
David, why don't you just
buy your own bike, then?

49
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:42,967
(chuckles)

50
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:45,467
He couldn't afford one.

51
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:46,867
(spits)

52
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,767
(laughing)

53
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,967
(shouts)

54
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:54,200
(grunting)

55
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,333
(dramatic music)

56
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,067
Get him, there he goes,
quick, come on, get him!

57
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:33,600
Come back here you coward!

58
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
I dare you to come back!

59
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:38,800
There he is!

60
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,633
We'll get you!

61
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:40,467
Hey!

62
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,400
Hello, Susan?

63
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,900
Look, I've got the stuff,

64
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,933
the quality's quite
good this time.

65
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:48,333
[Susan] Thanks
Linda, that's right,

66
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,600
(mumbling)

67
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,200
I'll need 100,000
more for the next time.

68
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,833
Do you think you can do that?

69
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,367
[Susan] Sure,
no problem at all.

70
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:58,333
We'll start at once.

71
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,567
Very well.

72
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:00,900
I'm going back to
Paris tomorrow,

73
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,800
so please, can you call
me when it's ready?

74
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,233
Of course, a deal's a deal.

75
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:06,200
Have a nice trip.

76
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,067
Goodbye.

77
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,733
Same deal next time.

78
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,700
Have a seat.

79
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
Thank you.

80
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,100
Please sit down.

81
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,133
So, you're Warren Lee?

82
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,433
Yes.

83
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:26,867
Starting salary
is $3000 a month,

84
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:30,633
then you'll get extra
for each assignment.

85
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,333
Miss Chernoy.

86
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,100
Oh, please call me Susan.

87
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,933
I'll be honest with you.

88
00:09:37,933 --> 00:09:39,667
I have no experience.

89
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:40,500
Oh?

90
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,333
Nevermind.

91
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,067
[Warren] I know
I told you I had,

92
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:47,067
but I'm keen to get into
modeling, so I made it up.

93
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,933
I like people to be honest.

94
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:51,967
And although you lied,
you're being honest now,

95
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,300
so I'm willing to train you.

96
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,067
Thanks very much.

97
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,933
I'll really try my best.

98
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,667
But above board.

99
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,467
No casting couch.

100
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:06,700
(chuckles)

101
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:11,700
(suspenseful music)

102
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Something wrong, boss?

103
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:18,067
It's very complicated.

104
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:24,100
Warren, our undercover agent,
has got into Bruce's gang.

105
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:28,600
But he's been bothered by
a lot of personal problems.

106
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Well, what sort of
personal problems?

107
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,200
Perhaps we can help, sir.

108
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,600
You can't do anything.

109
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,267
Got something to do
with his girlfriend Judy

110
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,500
and his brother David.

111
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,333
Oh.

112
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,400
These are Bruce's henchmen.

113
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,667
We have to get rid of
them to get to him.

114
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:47,500
Right.

115
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:50,967
Run a check on them.

116
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:51,800
Yes sir.

117
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,633
(upbeat music)

118
00:11:12,233 --> 00:11:15,233
(suspenseful music)

119
00:12:58,533 --> 00:13:00,600
(phone ringing)

120
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,533
[Andy] Special Unit.

121
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:03,767
Is that Andy Howe?

122
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,333
[Andy] Who is this?

123
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,567
Go to Green Park,
there's a surprise for you.

124
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,100
[Andy] Wait a
minute, who is this?

125
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,933
Hey...

126
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,767
(steady rock beat)

127
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:23,667
Hey Andy.

128
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:30,300
Do you really believe
that strange call?

129
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,600
Hey, it must be
a present for me.

130
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,767
Come on, I love surprises.

131
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,600
Hey, I'm hungry, let's go eat.

132
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,100
Come on, it's about time
we did something on our own.

133
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,833
(dramatic music)

134
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,467
This is my present?

135
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,100
Huh?

136
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,433
It's Black Dog.

137
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:15,700
Yeah, one of Bruce's men.

138
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:21,267
But why's he
dressed like this?

139
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:23,767
[Andy] Who put these on you?

140
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,467
Only a ninja

141
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,067
can defeat a ninja.

142
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:30,667
What's a ninja?

143
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:33,267
Not now, I'll tell you later.

144
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:35,867
(knocking)

145
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:36,700
Come in.

146
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:42,667
[Andy] We got him, sir.

147
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:43,633
Great.

148
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,200
You both did a great job.

149
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,600
I'm sure it wasn't easy.

150
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,733
Why thank you, sir,
but it was all Andy.

151
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,800
It wasn't easy, you're right.

152
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,433
It was pretty tough, he
put up quite a fight.

153
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,367
Huh?!

154
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:54,800
But Andy, that's not the way.

155
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,733
It wasn't like that.

156
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:56,833
Shh.

157
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,833
Black Dog said
something about a ninja.

158
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,067
What's a ninja?

159
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:04,233
(chuckles)

160
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,567
Just a fairy tale.

161
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:06,933
They don't exist.

162
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:08,300
Now there, you see?

163
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,700
I told you they didn't exist.

164
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,267
Morning Miss, your mail.

165
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:16,233
Thanks.

166
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:17,300
Thanks.

167
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,367
(phone ringing)

168
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:20,267
Morning.

169
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,267
Morning.

170
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:22,867
- Morning.
- Morning.

171
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:29,400
Susan.

172
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,633
Oh, hi there.

173
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:35,200
Take a look at these, a whole
bunch of orders for you.

174
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,700
All thanks to you.

175
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,133
I told you we could make
something out of you, didn't I?

176
00:15:42,133 --> 00:15:43,600
Thanks for the confidence.

177
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,067
You're very welcome.

178
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:48,267
You deserve it, anyway,
you've worked very hard,

179
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:50,767
and it should get better.

180
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:53,667
Now then, to show
my appreciation

181
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:55,567
for what you've done
for the company,

182
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:58,367
I'd like to invite you over
to my villa this afternoon,

183
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:01,733
if you're free,
that is, all right?

184
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,733
I'd be delighted.

185
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:05,967
Well, I'm very
glad to hear that.

186
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,067
It'll be nice for the two
of us to get together.

187
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,533
How about 3:30, huh?

188
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:12,167
Right, I'll be there.

189
00:16:12,167 --> 00:16:14,900
(cheerful music)

190
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,500
(laughs)

191
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,533
What a beautiful house.

192
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:41,367
You like it?

193
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:42,200
Me?

194
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:46,067
You mean this is for me?

195
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:48,800
Yeah, sure, you
made a lot of money.

196
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,633
But I...

197
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:53,067
I didn't make that much.

198
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:57,300
Well not yet, but I'm
sure you will in the future.

199
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,333
I've invested all I have in you.

200
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,367
So don't you let me down.

201
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:05,967
You wouldn't, would you?

202
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:07,533
Am I right?

203
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:08,700
Right.

204
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,767
Also, I bought a
fabulous new motorbike.

205
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,833
I think your brother
would love it.

206
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,367
Huh?

207
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,200
[David] It's fantastic.

208
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,767
A great machine.

209
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:21,533
I've always wanted
one like this.

210
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,067
[Warren] Well
then, do you like it?

211
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,900
It's mine?

212
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,833
Yeah.

213
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:39,667
The keys.

214
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:43,500
What?

215
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,433
Are you that rich?

216
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,700
Have you won the lottery?

217
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,067
A new house and a new bike?

218
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:49,633
[Warren] I won the lottery.

219
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:51,133
[David] You did?

220
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:55,167
How come you didn't say?

221
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:56,833
Anyway, whatever.

222
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:57,667
Thanks.

223
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,733
(engine starts)

224
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:05,567
I'll try it out.

225
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:06,867
Be careful.

226
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:07,700
Bye.

227
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,533
Warren,

228
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:18,733
did you do something
illegal to get that?

229
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:19,567
No.

230
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:23,033
Well I hope you didn't.

231
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:24,767
You'd better be true.

232
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:30,167
[Susan] Yes,
who's this speaking?

233
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,100
Listen Susan,
Tiger was killed.

234
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,300
I'll find out who did it,
but tell Albert to watch out.

235
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,233
Oh, all right.

236
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:39,200
Right, I'll tell him.

237
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,233
I'll see him very soon.

238
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:42,367
Okay.

239
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,200
Take care of yourself.

240
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:48,133
(upbeat music)

241
00:21:09,967 --> 00:21:11,400
You'd like a drink?

242
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,933
Huh?

243
00:21:12,933 --> 00:21:14,667
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

244
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:17,633
It doesn't matter.

245
00:21:17,633 --> 00:21:19,767
I was wondering what
you're doing later.

246
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:20,667
Huh?

247
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:21,500
Warren.

248
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,733
Oh.

249
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,900
Mrs. Phong.

250
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,533
Now don't you scare him away.

251
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:31,067
He's very young, you know.

252
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:33,800
Warren, it's time
that you were on.

253
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,633
Oh.

254
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,200
(chuckles)

255
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,867
Don't forget, I'll be waiting.

256
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,067
(chuckles)

257
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:45,567
Miss Susan.

258
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:47,567
He looks very promising.

259
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:49,933
Get me $10,000 US.

260
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:53,800
That'll be no problem at all.

261
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,600
Good, and don't let me hold
you up, I'll just wait here.

262
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,900
Then excuse me.

263
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,133
Mhmm.

264
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:01,667
Please, sit down.

265
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,867
(laughing)

266
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:10,300
Hi Albert.

267
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,233
Tiger's been killed, boss wants
you to keep a low profile.

268
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:13,367
I must rush now.

269
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:14,467
Hey, Susan.

270
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,400
Uh huh?

271
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,767
Did he say anything else?

272
00:22:16,767 --> 00:22:18,333
You know, about the operation.

273
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:19,767
[Susan] Not on the telephone.

274
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:22,500
Let's change the conversation,
or Lily will get bored.

275
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,867
I'm serious, Susan.

276
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:26,067
I heard you got a model
called Warren Lee.

277
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:27,067
Is that right?

278
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:28,667
Why yes.

279
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:29,833
[Albert] I'd like
to meet him sometime.

280
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,333
Well, when the time is right,

281
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,300
you can use him for
your next collection.

282
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,233
He looks good in
your sort of design.

283
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:36,133
[Albert] Right, it's a deal.

284
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:36,967
Right.

285
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:37,900
(chuckles)

286
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,733
Bye.

287
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,433
Let's go.

288
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,833
[Man] Hi Bruce.

289
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,433
How you doing?

290
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:54,967
Fine thank you.

291
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:56,467
Have you seen the stuff?

292
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:57,633
Yes.

293
00:22:57,633 --> 00:22:59,267
Quality's good this time.

294
00:22:59,267 --> 00:23:01,833
Very well, just see my man.

295
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:04,100
Okay, it's a deal.

296
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,600
Have a nice time here.

297
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,633
Good luck.

298
00:23:06,633 --> 00:23:07,567
Thanks.

299
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:09,200
Hope to see you again.

300
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,533
Well, goodbye.

301
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,667
(tires squeal)

302
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:21,433
(dramatic music)

303
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,533
(grunting)

304
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:25,367
Wait.

305
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:28,367
Take him back.

306
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,200
Yeah.

307
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,200
Come on, move!

308
00:23:51,967 --> 00:23:54,867
(mysterious music)

309
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:51,600
Keep up the good work.

310
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,067
[Andy] Well, it's an easy job.

311
00:24:53,067 --> 00:24:55,500
I arrested another
fairy tale yesterday.

312
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,067
A ninja's supposed
to be unbeatable.

313
00:24:58,067 --> 00:25:00,567
I'd like to meet a
real ninja one day.

314
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:02,133
Don't tell me you
believe in ninjas.

315
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,933
Of course not.

316
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:06,600
You said ninjas don't exist.

317
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,833
That's right.

318
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:12,700
Now Susan's beginning
to trust Warren,

319
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,567
but now he's playing
around with Lily,

320
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:16,600
Four Eyes' girlfriend.

321
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,167
What a lucky guy.

322
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,900
Do you want to change places?

323
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,400
Oh no no, no thank you, sir.

324
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,200
Right now the important thing

325
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,067
is for Warren to get
evidence against Four Eyes.

326
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:32,933
(light rock music)

327
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:41,067
Hey Mister.

328
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:45,800
You looking for a
bit of company, huh?

329
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:51,367
(sighs)

330
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,867
Hey Miss, want a drink?

331
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:29,067
Yeah, come on.

332
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:30,233
Yeah.

333
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:31,600
(chuckling)

334
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,600
(drunken muttering)

335
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:38,067
Hey, wait a minute
guys, wait a minute.

336
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:39,100
Excuse me.

337
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,800
She's a normal customer.

338
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,333
Oh, what, it won't hurt
her to have a drink with us.

339
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:45,900
Ah, that's right,
what's wrong with us, eh?

340
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,133
Why not have a drink with me?

341
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:48,333
Get off!

342
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,367
Hey come on, no
need to be like that.

343
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:52,333
(shouting)

344
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:53,600
What do you
think you're doing?

345
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,867
(shouting)

346
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:23,167
(screams)

347
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:31,467
(slow music)

348
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:39,633
Feeling better?

349
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:45,133
I know you, I saw you
at Susan's fashion show.

350
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,367
(giggles)

351
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:23,600
(romantic music)

352
00:30:28,333 --> 00:30:30,500
(moaning)

353
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:39,200
(eerie music)

354
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:46,333
I hate you.

355
00:31:09,933 --> 00:31:10,767
Warren.

356
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:13,300
Warren.

357
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,967
Judy.

358
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:16,867
Talk to me.

359
00:31:22,967 --> 00:31:23,800
Warren!

360
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,067
(intense music)

361
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:21,067
(phone ringing)

362
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:28,600
Yeah.

363
00:32:31,733 --> 00:32:33,367
Hi Philip, Bruce here.

364
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:36,133
Have you got that
photo of Jason Hart?

365
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:37,367
Right here, boss.

366
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:39,467
What do you want me to do, huh?

367
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:40,433
Go and finish him.

368
00:32:40,433 --> 00:32:42,333
Be careful, he's tough.

369
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,733
Yes boss.

370
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:45,133
Do it, quickly.

371
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,567
(dramatic music)

372
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:05,467
(suspenseful music)

373
00:33:59,867 --> 00:34:01,967
(grunts)

374
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:34,567
Nurse, can you help me?

375
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:35,400
Where's Judy Chan?

376
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,067
Oh, first room.

377
00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:38,433
[David] Warren.

378
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:40,167
David.

379
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,733
What's going on?

380
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,433
How's Judy?

381
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:47,900
Still alive.

382
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,067
Hey.

383
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:50,533
What's the matter?

384
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:55,467
It's all your
fault, messing around.

385
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:58,067
How could you do this?

386
00:34:58,067 --> 00:35:00,400
I've tried all night
long to get ahold of you.

387
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,467
Where the hell were you?

388
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:02,867
No bloody answer.

389
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:05,267
(sighs)

390
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:06,533
You listen.

391
00:35:06,533 --> 00:35:09,267
If Judy dies, I'll
never forgive you.

392
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:10,533
Brother or not.

393
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,333
David!

394
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:16,633
Go in and see Judy,
it's the very least

395
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:18,733
you could do for her now.

396
00:35:48,267 --> 00:35:49,100
Judy.

397
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:50,967
Judy.

398
00:35:54,433 --> 00:35:55,733
It's Warren.

399
00:35:55,733 --> 00:35:57,067
Please wake up.

400
00:36:02,267 --> 00:36:03,100
Judy.

401
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,400
Judy.

402
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,300
Forgive me.

403
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,233
I'm sorry.

404
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,333
So sorry.

405
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,433
(crying)

406
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,400
I tried to call you last night.

407
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:34,467
But Judy, your phone
was out of order.

408
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:41,067
I was terribly busy.

409
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:42,567
The time just went.

410
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:45,733
Forgive me.

411
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:51,133
You've changed, Warren.

412
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:53,700
You never used to be like this.

413
00:36:57,067 --> 00:36:59,100
(crying)

414
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,700
Judy, I love you.

415
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:05,233
I never realized how much.

416
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:08,200
Can you please forgive me?

417
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,500
Judy, I'll stop modeling.

418
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,633
We can be together.

419
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:14,467
You're all I want now.

420
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:15,900
Forever and ever.

421
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:19,367
Judy.

422
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:23,100
Promise me you'll get well.

423
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,200
We'll start again.

424
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,500
Just you and me forever.

425
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,333
All right?

426
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:33,600
Warren.

427
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,467
(knocking)

428
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,533
[David] Hi.

429
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,167
Can I help you?

430
00:37:58,167 --> 00:37:59,767
I'm looking for Warren Lee.

431
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:01,733
Is this where he lives?

432
00:38:01,733 --> 00:38:02,700
Yes.

433
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,133
What do you want?

434
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,367
And you are?

435
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:09,100
I'm his neighbor.

436
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,067
And you?

437
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:12,200
I'm just a friend.

438
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,133
Oh.

439
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:14,433
He's gone to see his girlfriend.

440
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:15,667
She's in the hospital.

441
00:38:15,667 --> 00:38:17,233
I don't know what
time he'll be back.

442
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:18,900
Sometimes very late.

443
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:22,600
Why don't you give me a message,
and I'll give it to him?

444
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,067
What's your name?

445
00:38:25,967 --> 00:38:29,333
You could tell
him Lily called by.

446
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:30,167
Right.

447
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:36,267
(laughing)

448
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,633
David!

449
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:46,467
David!

450
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,433
David!

451
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:04,233
You okay?

452
00:39:04,233 --> 00:39:05,167
Are you hurt?

453
00:39:05,167 --> 00:39:06,800
Never you mind.

454
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,367
Piss off.

455
00:39:08,367 --> 00:39:09,200
David.

456
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,467
You again?

457
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:13,233
Hey man, you're still here, huh?

458
00:39:13,233 --> 00:39:15,433
David, are these
creeps your friends?

459
00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:17,700
(grunting)

460
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,967
He's my brother.

461
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:22,500
Really gets up my nose.

462
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,333
Let's go.

463
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:25,467
David.

464
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,533
You're drunk.

465
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,867
Let us take you home.

466
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:31,700
What?

467
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,933
(chuckles)

468
00:39:32,933 --> 00:39:35,533
I've got no home,
and neither do you.

469
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:38,133
That place belongs to
Warren, and his girlfriend.

470
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:39,067
David.

471
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:40,967
What are you talking about?

472
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:41,900
David.

473
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,067
Bull.

474
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:44,933
Don't give me that.

475
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:46,133
I'm sorry.

476
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,367
But you've gotta
know, sooner or later.

477
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:52,933
David.

478
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:53,767
Right.

479
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:56,567
David!

480
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:57,800
Hey, hey.

481
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,067
I'm not gonna tell you
again, you asshole.

482
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:02,200
(grunting)

483
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:08,967
Taxi!

484
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:09,800
Taxi!

485
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,733
Follow that bike.

486
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:17,667
David!

487
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:19,933
Wait for me!

488
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:22,933
(laughing)

489
00:40:22,933 --> 00:40:24,267
Come on, let's go for a swim.

490
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:25,200
All right.

491
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,767
(laughing)

492
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:27,600
Whee!

493
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
David come back here!

494
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,467
David!

495
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:31,733
David!

496
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:33,033
Come on, David!

497
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:35,167
(laughing)

498
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:36,733
You gonna swim with
your clothes on?

499
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:37,800
Oh!

500
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,033
(laughing)

501
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,033
David!

502
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:45,867
Come back here!

503
00:40:45,867 --> 00:40:46,900
David!

504
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,100
(laughing)

505
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,133
David!

506
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:50,667
David!

507
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:52,233
Stop it, get off!

508
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,167
David, don't be so
stupid, come on home!

509
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:56,000
Get off!

510
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,333
Leave me alone!

511
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:00,900
Come on, we're going home!

512
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,800
What for?

513
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:03,667
David!

514
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:05,367
Come on!

515
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:06,500
Let go!

516
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,833
David, let's go home, come on!

517
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,700
And you!

518
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,267
(screams)

519
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:12,100
Judy!

520
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,567
Are you okay?

521
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:18,067
David!

522
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:19,200
David!
David!

523
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,700
David, come back here!

524
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,533
[Judy] David, come here!

525
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:23,567
Stay with me!

526
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:24,600
David!

527
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,133
David!

528
00:41:26,133 --> 00:41:26,967
David!

529
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,933
(grunting)

530
00:41:46,733 --> 00:41:48,667
Please will you stop fighting?

531
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:49,500
Stop it!

532
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,933
David!

533
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,733
David!

534
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:13,567
Get off!

535
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:17,800
Stop it!

536
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,800
Stop it!

537
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,200
Stop fighting, Warren, David!

538
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:29,500
Stop fighting please!

539
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,433
Stop it!

540
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:31,567
You, look at your face.

541
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:32,400
Huh?

542
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,500
David, Warren, stop it!

543
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,567
No more fighting,
please stop it now!

544
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,167
You dirty bastard.

545
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,433
Look, I don't
want to talk here.

546
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:51,600
Let's go home.

547
00:42:52,967 --> 00:42:54,467
David, stop it!

548
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:56,167
Come on, smack him!

549
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:57,267
David!

550
00:42:57,267 --> 00:42:58,100
Listen to me!

551
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,400
You don't understand.

552
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,867
You're right, I
don't understand.

553
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:02,567
What the hell do
you want to know?!

554
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:03,467
Me?

555
00:43:03,467 --> 00:43:05,733
(groaning)

556
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,933
You'll understand later.

557
00:43:09,933 --> 00:43:12,200
(grunting)

558
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,533
Warren.

559
00:43:17,533 --> 00:43:18,567
David!

560
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:19,867
Warren, wait for me.

561
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:20,700
David!

562
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,667
You're a real hero, David!

563
00:43:26,133 --> 00:43:27,233
Does it hurt?

564
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,767
(upbeat music)

565
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:46,600
Warren!

566
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,700
Hold these.

567
00:44:49,367 --> 00:44:51,133
Why are you here?

568
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:53,567
Well, I missed you.

569
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:56,567
You weren't in when I called by.

570
00:44:56,567 --> 00:45:00,467
What have you done to your
face, have you been in a fight?

571
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:01,433
Judy, I...

572
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,467
You've got a nerve, kid.

573
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,067
And so have you.

574
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:13,633
Just get lost.

575
00:45:13,633 --> 00:45:14,767
Judy!

576
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:15,600
Judy!

577
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,433
[Lily] Warren!

578
00:45:16,433 --> 00:45:17,667
Leave me alone!

579
00:45:17,667 --> 00:45:18,600
Warren, Warren I've
got to talk to you...

580
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,567
Get lost, get lost!

581
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:22,300
Stay away from me!

582
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,633
But that night, you
said you loved me.

583
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:30,467
(sighs)

584
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,833
Did I?

585
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:36,300
That'll teach you to
listen to a drunkard.

586
00:45:38,433 --> 00:45:42,600
Anyway, how did you get my
address, and my phone number?

587
00:45:46,767 --> 00:45:47,600
Tell me!

588
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,667
Susan.

589
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,867
[Warren] Warren here.

590
00:45:56,867 --> 00:45:57,700
Warren.

591
00:45:58,867 --> 00:46:01,067
You're doing too much,
so don't go any further.

592
00:46:01,067 --> 00:46:04,367
You could destroy
the plan, understand?

593
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:05,500
(knocking)

594
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,667
Yeah, come in.

595
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,067
Sir, the trap's been
set for tomorrow evening

596
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,200
at the Gold Pass Park.

597
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,800
We could bag $2 million.

598
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,167
That's right,
it'll be a big haul.

599
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:15,367
Excellent.

600
00:46:15,367 --> 00:46:16,200
Right.

601
00:46:18,267 --> 00:46:21,267
(suspenseful music)

602
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:35,200
Very good.

603
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,200
It's a deal.

604
00:46:38,167 --> 00:46:40,567
If you need any
more, let me know.

605
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:42,067
Oh yeah, one more thing.

606
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:44,467
You're under arrest.

607
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:45,500
You!

608
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,767
(coughing)

609
00:46:49,633 --> 00:46:52,133
Well he can't have gone far.

610
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:15,400
Hey, look.

611
00:47:22,067 --> 00:47:22,900
It's him!

612
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:27,633
Another one dressed like this.

613
00:47:27,633 --> 00:47:29,800
Who put these on?

614
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,867
Only a ninja can defeat
another ninja, see?

615
00:47:32,867 --> 00:47:34,367
Have you heard that
line before somewhere?

616
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:36,333
[John] I think I have.

617
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,567
Andy.

618
00:47:37,567 --> 00:47:38,500
John.

619
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,367
What's going on here?

620
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:42,333
We got this guy, sir.

621
00:47:42,333 --> 00:47:44,067
Well done, men.

622
00:47:44,067 --> 00:47:46,667
It's another one
dressed like this, sir.

623
00:47:46,667 --> 00:47:49,900
Hmm, looks like another
costume party tonight.

624
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,733
Mhmm.

625
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:52,700
All right, men.

626
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:53,800
Let's move on.

627
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,467
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

628
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,400
(suspenseful music)

629
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,800
We lost three men, but
our ninja spirit never dies.

630
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,567
To die the death of a ninja
is a glorious way to die.

631
00:48:27,567 --> 00:48:30,300
[Ninjas] Born
ninja, die ninja.

632
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,833
Our birth is at
the dawn of time.

633
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:39,533
When we embark upon a
mission, we fear nothing.

634
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:41,933
If our enemies rise, elimate.

635
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:44,767
If nations, obliterate.

636
00:48:45,867 --> 00:48:47,833
If evil rises, destroy.

637
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:50,233
Once a ninja, always a ninja.

638
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:54,667
Judy.

639
00:48:57,133 --> 00:48:58,267
Judy.

640
00:48:58,267 --> 00:48:59,333
Listen to me.

641
00:49:14,767 --> 00:49:17,067
(knocking)

642
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:21,667
(suspenseful music)

643
00:49:24,433 --> 00:49:25,833
[Judy] David.

644
00:49:25,833 --> 00:49:29,900
Warren and I have talked
things over, and it's okay now.

645
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,467
He explained that he's
been under pressure,

646
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:34,167
and things got out of hand.

647
00:49:34,167 --> 00:49:36,367
He's agreed to give up
modeling immediately

648
00:49:36,367 --> 00:49:38,900
and lead a normal life.

649
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,400
Look after yourself.

650
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,333
Love, Judy.

651
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,400
(intense rock music)

652
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:00,167
Hey, they look great, huh?

653
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,000
(laughs)

654
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,233
I like the guy more
than the clothes.

655
00:50:18,233 --> 00:50:19,900
Oh don't be silly!

656
00:50:26,033 --> 00:50:29,100
This time the
quality's quite good.

657
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:33,400
Great.

658
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:38,600
(light rock music)

659
00:50:41,233 --> 00:50:42,867
(laughs)

660
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:43,700
Susan.

661
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,133
Huh?

662
00:50:45,133 --> 00:50:46,100
Why don't you introduce
your friend to me?

663
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:48,800
Oh, Albert, this is Warren.

664
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,033
Ah.

665
00:50:50,033 --> 00:50:51,367
This is my card.

666
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,333
Mr. Wong, Mrs. Wong.

667
00:50:55,233 --> 00:50:56,333
(chuckles)

668
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:57,867
We're not exactly married.

669
00:50:57,867 --> 00:51:00,167
However, we are
very close friends.

670
00:51:00,167 --> 00:51:02,367
(laughing)

671
00:51:08,067 --> 00:51:09,333
Don't be confused.

672
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,067
Lily is his right hand woman.

673
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,833
(chuckling)

674
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,233
Yes.

675
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:16,100
She's my live-in lover.

676
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,633
It's not confusing.

677
00:51:17,633 --> 00:51:18,867
(laughing)

678
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,267
[Susan] Oh Albert,
don't be so blunt,

679
00:51:20,267 --> 00:51:22,533
you made Lily blush again.

680
00:51:22,533 --> 00:51:24,800
(laughing)

681
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,333
Susan.

682
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,067
Don't be so old-fashioned.

683
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:31,767
Times have changed.

684
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:35,367
Anyway, you've been in
this business a while.

685
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:37,467
You know the score.

686
00:51:37,467 --> 00:51:39,300
Warren, am I right?

687
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,567
(chuckles)

688
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:49,233
Warren, you can ask her
to dance if you like.

689
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:51,233
I'm not her jailer, huh?

690
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,767
[Susan] Oh, Albert, stop it.

691
00:51:55,767 --> 00:51:59,267
We all know you're
really jealous of Lily.

692
00:51:59,267 --> 00:52:01,900
No one would dare
dance with her.

693
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,667
(laughing)

694
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,567
[Waitress] Excuse me.

695
00:52:07,267 --> 00:52:08,367
I told you.

696
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:12,633
You can dance.

697
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:15,067
I don't mind that.

698
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,133
Go ahead.

699
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,233
[Susan] Go on.

700
00:52:23,467 --> 00:52:27,633
* I can hardly
see in front of me

701
00:52:30,833 --> 00:52:33,833
* At last I am free

702
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:39,567
* I can hardly
see in front of me

703
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:43,733
* I can hardly
see in front of me

704
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,700
* At last I am free

705
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,067
* I can hardly
see in front of me

706
00:52:54,067 --> 00:52:56,300
(chuckles)

707
00:52:57,567 --> 00:53:00,533
Susan, don't they make
a good-looking couple?

708
00:53:00,533 --> 00:53:02,167
Made for each other.

709
00:53:04,067 --> 00:53:07,067
* At last I am free

710
00:53:08,233 --> 00:53:12,433
* I can hardly
see in front of me

711
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:15,700
* I can hardly see in front

712
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,800
I've got it here, sir.

713
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
* Of me

714
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:24,067
(dramatic music)

715
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,900
Well, Albert, I was...

716
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,733
Oh.

717
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,767
(crying)

718
00:53:52,933 --> 00:53:54,733
How dare you cheat.

719
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:56,233
You bitch!

720
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,233
How could you?!

721
00:53:58,233 --> 00:53:59,067
You cow!

722
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:01,433
Oh you get me mad!

723
00:54:02,967 --> 00:54:04,633
(whimpers)

724
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:06,267
Tell me.

725
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:09,067
How many times did you do it?

726
00:54:09,067 --> 00:54:10,300
Huh?

727
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,133
Tell me!

728
00:54:12,233 --> 00:54:13,967
Does he do it better?

729
00:54:15,133 --> 00:54:16,400
Huh?

730
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,233
Tell me!

731
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,433
Talk.

732
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,167
Huh?

733
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:30,467
You little whore.

734
00:54:31,767 --> 00:54:34,400
You're just a cheap slut.

735
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,733
(screaming)

736
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,233
I'm gonna kill you.

737
00:54:41,233 --> 00:54:43,467
(whipping)

738
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,333
I hate you.

739
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,300
You can't run away.

740
00:54:58,133 --> 00:54:59,400
Come back here.

741
00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:01,933
Please don't.

742
00:55:01,933 --> 00:55:02,767
Help!

743
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:04,667
Come here.

744
00:55:06,533 --> 00:55:07,600
I'll get you.

745
00:55:12,067 --> 00:55:13,833
Yelling for help, huh?

746
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,067
I'll show you.

747
00:55:19,967 --> 00:55:22,300
I won't forgive you.

748
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,067
How dare you.

749
00:55:24,067 --> 00:55:26,367
(screaming)

750
00:55:30,933 --> 00:55:33,767
You'll never betray me again!

751
00:55:33,767 --> 00:55:35,200
You common whore!

752
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:38,400
Morning sir.

753
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,200
We caught another
one of those guys

754
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:42,600
that you said don't exist.

755
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,800
What were they called?

756
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,200
Ninjas?

757
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,067
Possibly he was on his
way to a costume party?

758
00:55:49,067 --> 00:55:50,067
Be serious.

759
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,333
Listen, Warren has
followed our plan.

760
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:57,067
Four Eyes and Susan are
falling into our trap.

761
00:55:57,067 --> 00:56:00,267
We should be able to
clear this up soon.

762
00:56:00,267 --> 00:56:02,733
(eerie music)

763
00:56:04,267 --> 00:56:05,833
Now get outta here!

764
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:14,367
(suspenseful music)

765
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,067
The notes?

766
00:56:26,067 --> 00:56:27,800
Yes, you got the money?

767
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,200
Here.

768
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,367
Let me see it.

769
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,133
That's all right.

770
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,833
You're under arrest!

771
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:45,667
Huh?

772
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:52,667
Hey!

773
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:57,367
Let me go, you son of a bitch!

774
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:01,300
(dramatic music)

775
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:08,500
(steam hissing)

776
00:57:48,067 --> 00:57:50,900
(swords clanging)

777
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:05,400
(dramatic music)

778
00:58:17,367 --> 00:58:19,600
(laughing)

779
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,633
Not many people refuse me.

780
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:27,467
You see, I carry quite a bit
of weight in the business.

781
00:58:27,467 --> 00:58:30,600
Most people want to
succeed, and don't care how.

782
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,967
It's a hard world out there,

783
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:36,200
and opportunities
don't come easily.

784
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,700
Most people want
fame, money and power.

785
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,067
Usually, people don't care where

786
00:58:42,067 --> 00:58:44,367
the money comes from or how.

787
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:49,533
And are you really
any different?

788
00:58:49,533 --> 00:58:52,367
Or just a better
line of bullshit?

789
00:58:55,067 --> 00:58:57,500
But I'm sure
you're not like that.

790
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:58,833
You're too kind.

791
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:01,600
Of course.

792
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,067
It doesn't hurt to be kind.

793
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:04,500
But I'm no fool.

794
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,700
I have my motives.

795
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:08,433
(chuckles)

796
00:59:08,433 --> 00:59:11,433
I find kindness
very effective, hmm?

797
00:59:14,433 --> 00:59:18,433
So Warren, even though you
won't be working for me,

798
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:20,933
I'd like to give
you a little gift.

799
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:22,967
There's no need
for that, really.

800
00:59:22,967 --> 00:59:23,800
(laughs)

801
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,900
No need?

802
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,300
Hey, I'd like to.

803
00:59:27,567 --> 00:59:29,700
I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

804
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,233
I ordered it to be sent to
your home as soon as possible.

805
00:59:32,233 --> 00:59:33,233
Thank you.

806
00:59:34,133 --> 00:59:35,067
Goodbye.

807
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:35,867
Goodbye.

808
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,667
Oh, you might like to
know what I gave him.

809
00:59:51,833 --> 00:59:54,067
(laughing)

810
00:59:58,233 --> 00:59:59,400
You bastard.

811
01:00:00,967 --> 01:00:03,900
Bastard, bastard,
bastard, bastard,

812
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,333
I hate you!

813
01:00:09,167 --> 01:00:10,633
Judy, I...

814
01:00:10,633 --> 01:00:11,467
Get off.

815
01:00:12,733 --> 01:00:14,100
Don't come near me.

816
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,333
Judy!

817
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:16,400
Leave me alone!

818
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,400
Judy.

819
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,233
Judy!

820
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,133
How could you?

821
01:00:21,133 --> 01:00:22,067
Go to hell.

822
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:27,100
(suspenseful music)

823
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:40,633
David.

824
01:00:40,633 --> 01:00:42,300
Where are you going?

825
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:45,267
I'm leaving too.

826
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,000
As of now, I have no brother.

827
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,633
David!

828
01:00:48,633 --> 01:00:51,300
(intense music)

829
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:39,767
(phone ringing)

830
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:54,867
Hello?

831
01:01:54,867 --> 01:01:55,700
[Jason] Hello?

832
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:56,567
Warren's that you?

833
01:01:56,567 --> 01:01:57,833
Yes.

834
01:01:57,833 --> 01:02:00,533
Look, I know this
is a tricky situation.

835
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:02,800
Warren, I understand
your feelings.

836
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,733
But this is a critical moment.

837
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:07,567
Tell your brother
not to fool around.

838
01:02:07,567 --> 01:02:10,233
Otherwise, our
mission will fail.

839
01:02:10,233 --> 01:02:11,833
Have you got that?

840
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,767
I'll contact you, okay?

841
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:45,900
He's coming.

842
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:46,733
All right?

843
01:02:46,733 --> 01:02:47,900
Ready?

844
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:48,733
Okay.

845
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:52,967
(yells)

846
01:03:03,767 --> 01:03:05,067
He's out cold.

847
01:03:05,067 --> 01:03:05,900
Now do the rest.

848
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:07,200
(dramatic music)

849
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,067
Come on.

850
01:03:11,133 --> 01:03:12,467
Go on, faster.

851
01:03:12,467 --> 01:03:13,300
Faster.

852
01:03:14,433 --> 01:03:15,967
Hurry up.

853
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,300
Pull him faster.

854
01:03:21,067 --> 01:03:21,900
Come on.

855
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,933
Go.

856
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:24,800
Faster.

857
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,633
Hurry up.

858
01:03:27,533 --> 01:03:29,600
Come on, you guys.

859
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,500
Pull.

860
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,767
(shouting)

861
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,233
Get outta here, go!

862
01:04:26,233 --> 01:04:28,667
(whimpering)

863
01:04:50,567 --> 01:04:51,733
[Woman] David?

864
01:04:51,733 --> 01:04:52,667
David!

865
01:04:52,667 --> 01:04:53,500
David.

866
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,333
David!

867
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,600
Oh David, what's
happened to you?

868
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,700
Why've you been fighting?

869
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,300
Hey Mary, he's dead!

870
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,200
You've hurt yourself.

871
01:05:06,267 --> 01:05:08,700
David, what are you gonna do?

872
01:05:10,067 --> 01:05:13,133
David, you'll get into
real trouble, you will.

873
01:05:13,133 --> 01:05:15,933
The other guys will tell
the police, I tell you.

874
01:05:15,933 --> 01:05:16,867
What?

875
01:05:16,867 --> 01:05:18,100
What can I do?

876
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,733
Come on, David,
we'll hide you.

877
01:05:19,733 --> 01:05:21,733
Yeah, come on David!

878
01:05:21,733 --> 01:05:23,900
(suspenseful music)

879
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:25,167
Yeah.

880
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:27,400
I'll be waiting for you
at the Fung Chow Hotel.

881
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,467
You can get my room
number from reception.

882
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:32,067
I want to tell you about
Albert's illegal businesses.

883
01:05:32,067 --> 01:05:35,467
It's the only thing
that's gonna save us.

884
01:05:35,467 --> 01:05:37,533
He'll never forgive
either of us.

885
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,400
I don't care.

886
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,067
[Lily] Oh look,
don't be silly.

887
01:05:41,067 --> 01:05:43,600
You're in danger at the moment.

888
01:05:45,967 --> 01:05:46,933
So what?

889
01:05:46,933 --> 01:05:48,100
It doesn't matter to me.

890
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:50,600
[Lily] Warren, listen to me.

891
01:05:52,467 --> 01:05:53,633
There you are.

892
01:05:53,633 --> 01:05:54,733
Take the money.

893
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:56,600
And here's my name card.

894
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,933
Use it if you need any help.

895
01:06:03,233 --> 01:06:04,167
Well go on.

896
01:06:06,067 --> 01:06:10,467
Everybody knows that I like
to help people in trouble.

897
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:11,300
Here.

898
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:13,200
Thank you sir.

899
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,067
(chuckles)

900
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:16,100
It's a pleasure.

901
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,733
Mr. Albert can
settle anything.

902
01:06:18,733 --> 01:06:19,667
(laughs)

903
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:21,400
Not at all, not at all.

904
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,167
Remember to repay
him when you can.

905
01:06:23,167 --> 01:06:24,767
You owe your life to him.

906
01:06:24,767 --> 01:06:26,067
Of course I will.

907
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:28,233
I'll pay you back
as soon as possible.

908
01:06:28,233 --> 01:06:29,433
Yeah.

909
01:06:29,433 --> 01:06:30,867
It's okay.

910
01:06:30,867 --> 01:06:31,933
Take your time.

911
01:06:31,933 --> 01:06:32,867
Thanks, goodbye.

912
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:33,700
Come on.

913
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:34,933
Come on.

914
01:06:34,933 --> 01:06:36,400
One moment.

915
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,333
Would you mind
telling me your name?

916
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:41,067
I'm David Lee?

917
01:06:41,067 --> 01:06:41,867
David?

918
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:46,967
Do you know Warren Lee?

919
01:06:48,867 --> 01:06:50,367
He's my brother.

920
01:06:52,233 --> 01:06:55,467
Would you mind
sitting down a minute?

921
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,367
Come, over here.

922
01:06:58,367 --> 01:06:59,200
Oh.

923
01:07:00,633 --> 01:07:03,367
I don't know if you know
this, but he's in grave danger.

924
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:04,967
Danger?

925
01:07:04,967 --> 01:07:06,167
Sit down.

926
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:07,067
Right.

927
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,633
Her?

928
01:07:15,633 --> 01:07:17,567
You know her?

929
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:21,167
She's my girlfriend,
but she cheated on me.

930
01:07:23,067 --> 01:07:26,200
You know your brother's
just a gigolo.

931
01:07:27,833 --> 01:07:31,100
He says they're just
business partners.

932
01:07:35,733 --> 01:07:39,900
I expect Lily to be faithful
to me, that's our deal.

933
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:45,233
But she's made a
complete fool of me.

934
01:07:46,933 --> 01:07:50,167
I don't know how your
brother found out,

935
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:53,967
but Lily's scared and he's
meeting her at 7:30 tonight,

936
01:07:53,967 --> 01:07:56,100
in the Fung Chow Hotel.

937
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,300
She's planning to kill him.

938
01:07:57,300 --> 01:07:58,133
What?

939
01:08:04,267 --> 01:08:06,367
You're a good boy.

940
01:08:06,367 --> 01:08:10,800
David, you don't want to see
your brother killed, do you?

941
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,800
You could help him out.

942
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,233
You could prevent
him from death.

943
01:08:15,233 --> 01:08:16,067
Great.

944
01:08:17,333 --> 01:08:19,833
(eerie music)

945
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:24,900
(laughing)

946
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,233
Well I hope he dies.

947
01:08:31,233 --> 01:08:32,733
Why?

948
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:34,933
He whispered "Anne" to me
right at the wrong moment.

949
01:08:34,933 --> 01:08:37,733
(laughing)

950
01:08:37,733 --> 01:08:40,900
Boss, we beat him up,
just so he could get killed.

951
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,233
Oh, so he can convalesce here.

952
01:08:43,233 --> 01:08:44,200
I'll pay for it.

953
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,067
Thank you boss.

954
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:47,233
I'll see you in the morning.

955
01:08:47,233 --> 01:08:48,867
Thank you, boss.

956
01:08:48,867 --> 01:08:50,833
(chuckling)

957
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:53,567
(dramatic music)

958
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:01,200
Now Miss, here's your key.

959
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,300
Thank you, I'm expecting a
visitor, please send him up.

960
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,633
All right.

961
01:09:04,633 --> 01:09:07,300
(intense music)

962
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:41,433
Miss?

963
01:10:41,433 --> 01:10:42,400
Yes?

964
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,667
Which room is Lily Mack in?

965
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:45,000
Just a minute.

966
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:49,067
305.

967
01:10:49,067 --> 01:10:49,900
Thanks.

968
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,300
You're welcome.

969
01:10:54,267 --> 01:10:55,100
David.

970
01:11:06,233 --> 01:11:08,300
(crying)

971
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:12,900
Quiet!

972
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:13,867
Stop crying!

973
01:11:13,867 --> 01:11:15,267
Or I'll kill you!

974
01:11:30,933 --> 01:11:31,833
Now listen.

975
01:11:33,433 --> 01:11:35,200
Stay away from my brother.

976
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,600
If you hurt him at
all, you're dead meat!

977
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:43,767
(crying)

978
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,067
(eerie music)

979
01:11:53,533 --> 01:11:54,567
Yes?

980
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:55,400
Who is it?

981
01:12:10,733 --> 01:12:12,067
(dramatic music)

982
01:12:12,067 --> 01:12:14,167
(screams)

983
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:21,633
Thank you.

984
01:12:21,633 --> 01:12:22,700
Not at all.

985
01:12:30,967 --> 01:12:32,733
I've done it, boss.

986
01:12:32,733 --> 01:12:34,067
It's all over.

987
01:12:34,067 --> 01:12:35,600
Lily's been killed.

988
01:12:38,733 --> 01:12:39,733
Lily?

989
01:12:39,733 --> 01:12:41,067
Lily?

990
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:42,667
(dramatic music)

991
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:44,133
Lily!

992
01:12:44,133 --> 01:12:45,633
Lily!

993
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:48,133
Susan, I'm gonna give
you an important mission,

994
01:12:48,133 --> 01:12:49,867
so report to me right away.

995
01:12:49,867 --> 01:12:53,467
Okay, I've got that sir,
I'm on my way already.

996
01:12:53,467 --> 01:12:56,467
(suspenseful music)

997
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:14,533
This is a blood mission.

998
01:13:16,867 --> 01:13:21,067
We must rise above all emotion
and overcome our desire.

999
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,967
We must devote ourselves
to our sacred cause.

1000
01:13:25,967 --> 01:13:29,067
To live the life of a ninja
is a sacred way to live.

1001
01:13:29,067 --> 01:13:30,433
This I know.

1002
01:13:30,433 --> 01:13:31,867
You are a good ninja.

1003
01:13:31,867 --> 01:13:35,867
Remember, the ninja empire
shall be supreme, and righteous.

1004
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,567
(shouts)

1005
01:14:11,233 --> 01:14:12,433
Judy, still here?

1006
01:14:12,433 --> 01:14:14,467
Why are you so late, David?

1007
01:14:14,467 --> 01:14:15,833
Something awful's happened.

1008
01:14:15,833 --> 01:14:17,200
Really?

1009
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,333
Your brother's been
implicated in a case of murder.

1010
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:21,233
He's what?!

1011
01:14:21,233 --> 01:14:24,533
He was meeting that creature
Lily at the Fung Chow Hotel.

1012
01:14:24,533 --> 01:14:26,300
She had something to tell him.

1013
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,067
But just after he left,
she was found murdered!

1014
01:14:30,067 --> 01:14:31,833
And my brother?

1015
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,867
The police said
Lily was killed

1016
01:14:33,867 --> 01:14:35,967
minutes after Warren arrived.

1017
01:14:35,967 --> 01:14:38,133
He was still holding the
knife that killed her.

1018
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:40,700
His prints were on the door.

1019
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,667
I can hardly believe it.

1020
01:14:42,667 --> 01:14:45,433
He'd never do
anything like that.

1021
01:14:46,933 --> 01:14:48,767
I've been desperate
waiting for you.

1022
01:14:48,767 --> 01:14:50,067
What can we do?

1023
01:14:51,533 --> 01:14:52,367
What?

1024
01:14:52,367 --> 01:14:53,267
God dammit.

1025
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:56,433
Albert Wong's tricked me.

1026
01:14:57,833 --> 01:14:59,800
I'll kill him!

1027
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,833
Calm down.

1028
01:15:01,933 --> 01:15:04,067
I must equal the score.

1029
01:15:07,267 --> 01:15:08,667
(motorcycle revving)

1030
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:09,500
Oh no.

1031
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,600
David!

1032
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:11,433
Come back.

1033
01:15:12,933 --> 01:15:13,767
Come back!

1034
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,367
(laughing)

1035
01:15:25,667 --> 01:15:27,867
Warren's been charged,

1036
01:15:27,867 --> 01:15:32,700
and I dare say, David will
be involved before very long.

1037
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:34,800
(laughing)

1038
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,800
And we can
congratulate ourselves.

1039
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,267
(laughing)

1040
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:40,333
Boss, we'd never let you down,

1041
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:41,567
you know us better than that.

1042
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:43,833
(laughing)

1043
01:15:47,067 --> 01:15:49,100
Here, go and enjoy yourselves.

1044
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:51,200
You've earned
every dollar of it.

1045
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,333
Come on, guys.

1046
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:53,900
Let's hit the town!

1047
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,200
Thanks, big brother.

1048
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,067
We're off now.

1049
01:15:56,067 --> 01:15:57,600
See you later.

1050
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,233
Hey, I wanna come!

1051
01:15:59,233 --> 01:16:01,333
Mary, stay here.

1052
01:16:01,333 --> 01:16:04,067
Now learn from what you
know and don't follow Lily,

1053
01:16:04,067 --> 01:16:04,833
all right?

1054
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:05,767
I'm not that stupid.

1055
01:16:05,767 --> 01:16:08,067
(laughing)

1056
01:16:08,067 --> 01:16:10,900
(loud chattering)

1057
01:16:17,133 --> 01:16:19,400
(grunting)

1058
01:16:56,067 --> 01:16:58,067
(yells)

1059
01:17:20,133 --> 01:17:22,067
[David] No, no.

1060
01:17:22,067 --> 01:17:23,500
No.

1061
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,333
Please.

1062
01:17:25,233 --> 01:17:27,567
(grunting)

1063
01:17:27,567 --> 01:17:29,800
(laughing)

1064
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:45,800
(yells)

1065
01:18:00,067 --> 01:18:02,667
(dramatic music)

1066
01:18:02,667 --> 01:18:05,067
(gun fires)

1067
01:18:12,067 --> 01:18:14,700
(yells)

1068
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:17,067
(gun fires)

1069
01:18:34,533 --> 01:18:36,800
(laughing)

1070
01:18:39,533 --> 01:18:42,267
(dramatic music)

1071
01:18:54,767 --> 01:18:56,067
No wait.

1072
01:18:56,067 --> 01:18:56,867
It's...

1073
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,433
It's a misunderstanding.

1074
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,367
I didn't know he
was your brother.

1075
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:08,167
Please don't hurt me.

1076
01:19:08,167 --> 01:19:10,667
I'll give you anything you want.

1077
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:12,067
I swear to god.

1078
01:19:12,067 --> 01:19:12,867
Warren.

1079
01:19:16,967 --> 01:19:17,800
Warren.

1080
01:19:19,133 --> 01:19:21,867
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1081
01:19:21,867 --> 01:19:24,300
(whimpering)

1082
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,333
(grunting)

1083
01:19:58,833 --> 01:20:01,600
(dramatic music)

1084
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,033
(gun fires)

1085
01:20:23,033 --> 01:20:25,400
(yells)

1086
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,467
(grunts)

1087
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,433
David!

1088
01:20:36,767 --> 01:20:37,600
David?

1089
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,800
It's all right now.

1090
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,633
Please wake up.

1091
01:20:41,633 --> 01:20:43,067
David!

1092
01:20:43,067 --> 01:20:44,867
It's really interesting,
all these ninjas,

1093
01:20:44,867 --> 01:20:46,033
don't you think?

1094
01:20:46,033 --> 01:20:46,933
I mean...

1095
01:20:46,933 --> 01:20:47,767
(clears throat)

1096
01:20:47,767 --> 01:20:49,400
Oh, sir.

1097
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:51,067
You got a gift here.

1098
01:20:52,967 --> 01:20:53,933
Who sent it?

1099
01:20:53,933 --> 01:20:55,700
[Andy] I don't know.

1100
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:58,600
Hey, they're good
looking swords.

1101
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:02,633
[Andy] Why the red cloth?

1102
01:21:02,633 --> 01:21:04,533
It's a ninja legend.

1103
01:21:04,533 --> 01:21:07,167
When a long sword is on
top of a short sword,

1104
01:21:07,167 --> 01:21:10,733
and covered with a red
cloth, it means a challenge.

1105
01:21:10,733 --> 01:21:13,567
No one can turn
down the challenge.

1106
01:21:13,567 --> 01:21:14,900
You're gonna
accept the challenge?

1107
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,400
You are a ninja, aren't you?

1108
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:21,300
(suspenseful music)

1109
01:21:40,933 --> 01:21:43,267
(exploding)

1110
01:22:25,267 --> 01:22:28,067
(revving engine)

1111
01:23:21,767 --> 01:23:24,433
(engine idling)

1112
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,667
(suspenseful music)

1113
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:09,500
(steel ringing)

1114
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:27,267
(steam hissing)

1115
01:25:05,300 --> 01:25:07,800
(eerie music)

1116
01:25:11,267 --> 01:25:14,100
I am the champion
of the ninjas.

1117
01:25:15,567 --> 01:25:18,233
(intense music)
