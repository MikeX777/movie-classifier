1
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,171
Do you really want to break up?

2
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:17,463
I did empty the wardrobe,

3
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:19,713
did you think I was just
getting them dry cleaned?

4
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:21,129
We're adults,

5
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,296
you should've just told me directly.

6
00:01:23,386 --> 00:01:24,505
It's exactly because we're adults

7
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:26,886
that not everything
has to be so direct.

8
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:34,004
I'm not wealthy
and I'm not very smart,

9
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,171
but I know exactly what I want.

10
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:37,129
"77 Heartbreaks"

11
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:38,088
"Heartbeat Shutter"

12
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:40,796
He's always out drinking
with his friends,

13
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:42,511
and he's a reckless driver.

14
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:44,463
How can I not worry about him?

15
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:47,843
I know, is it so hard
to make a phone call or send a text?

16
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:53,129
Eva's father had a wish,

17
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,088
which is for his daughter
to find a good husband.

18
00:01:55,178 --> 00:01:57,672
Mrs Lui, I did think about marriage.

19
00:01:57,762 --> 00:01:59,261
The happiness I'll give you

20
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:02,630
will definitely make up
the 77 times I broke your heart.

21
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,886
I hope you can forgive me
one last time.

22
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:10,261
You'd already closed the file,
yet here you are again.

23
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:12,094
You're just torturing yourself.

24
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:14,754
I left that notebook out on purpose

25
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:15,753
for you to see,

26
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:16,879
and I guess this is what

27
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:19,428
that girl left out on purpose
for me too.

28
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,803
Look...

29
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:23,171
I was in a mess, I don't have...

30
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:24,588
Leave me alone!

31
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:25,672
"77 Heartbreaks"

32
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:53,630
That's a definite no.

33
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:58,886
- You look gorgeous!
- How's this one?

34
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:01,843
No way!

35
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:03,088
So ugly.

36
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:06,927
Cheers!

37
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:08,921
It's too tight.

38
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,595
One, two, three!

39
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,927
"77 Heartwarmings"

40
00:03:42,762 --> 00:03:44,219
Solicitor Eva Lui!

41
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,213
Are you ready to go?

42
00:03:47,303 --> 00:03:50,796
White already comes with
so many styles, it's hard to pick.

43
00:03:50,886 --> 00:03:54,171
Men are no different,
they come in all shapes and sizes.

44
00:03:54,261 --> 00:03:56,844
- Afraid of picking the wrong one?
- No.

45
00:03:58,094 --> 00:03:59,546
I'm not ready.

46
00:03:59,636 --> 00:04:01,796
You're usually so decisive,

47
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:03,672
but now you're just
throwing out excuses.

48
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:06,296
If you do pick the wrong one,
just get a divorce.

49
00:04:06,386 --> 00:04:09,380
I'm moving heaven and earth
to put together this wedding

50
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,886
just so I can get divorced?

51
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:11,837
According to statistics,

52
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:15,338
11.61 million marriages were
registered nationwide last year.

53
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:19,421
Meanwhile,
there were 2.32 million divorces

54
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,588
and a 20 percent increase
in divorce rate.

55
00:04:22,678 --> 00:04:25,380
Which also means one out of five
marriages end in divorce,

56
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,546
and there is another divorce
happening every three minutes.

57
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,796
Based on the cases
our firm has handled,

58
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:34,505
these are the top ten reasons
for divorce.

59
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:36,796
He doesn't love me anymore.

60
00:04:36,886 --> 00:04:38,672
That's right,
I don't love her anymore.

61
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,178
We haven't talked in over 40 years.

62
00:04:41,886 --> 00:04:46,254
He never gave me a cent
to raise these kids.

63
00:04:46,344 --> 00:04:48,843
- Don't play with that.
- Isn't he useless?

64
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:51,094
An irresponsible,
useless piece of trash!

65
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:56,129
I won't get alimony
if I don't get divorced,

66
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:59,837
and how will I have
a steady income then?

67
00:04:59,927 --> 00:05:01,254
Let me tell you, lady.

68
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,380
A family unit can only
buy one home in China.

69
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,254
Baby, if we're both single,

70
00:05:06,344 --> 00:05:08,213
then we can buy another home!

71
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:09,754
So we can each have one!

72
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:13,754
She's changed,
she used to be thinner than me!

73
00:05:13,844 --> 00:05:15,927
- She abuses me.
- Shut your mouth!

74
00:05:16,053 --> 00:05:17,505
No sex!

75
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:20,171
I don't know why we got married...

76
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:22,213
In the past year, our firm's offices

77
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,046
in Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Shenzhen

78
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:26,630
saw business double.

79
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,053
However, this is also
the tragedy of our generation.

80
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:40,463
"Adam Cheung"

81
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:44,595
"We held hands for the first time
8 years ago."

82
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:48,005
Come in.

83
00:05:48,803 --> 00:05:50,713
Daisy says when you get
to the airport in London,

84
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:52,672
there will be a driver
waiting for you.

85
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:54,213
She's truly a winner at life,

86
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,046
even her kid's one-month banquet
has to go international.

87
00:05:57,136 --> 00:05:59,338
Why don't you fly out early
with me anyway?

88
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:00,296
Oh, I know.

89
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:03,004
You don't want to be on
the same plane as NT Tang, right?

90
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:04,004
Hi, Mr Tang.

91
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:05,261
I'm Eva.

92
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:08,470
Hi there, you can just call me NT.

93
00:06:10,595 --> 00:06:13,380
He's already pretty nice
for a nouveau riche.

94
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,927
Plenty of girls would jump
at the chance of marrying him,

95
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:17,453
and you would've been set for life.

96
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:18,843
What are you doing?

97
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:22,505
Even your phone still misses Adam?

98
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:24,428
You guys have split
for a year already.

99
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:26,463
"Saving"

100
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,720
Good thing that
you back-up the phone regularly.

101
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:39,053
Be yourself, be happy!

102
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:43,672
Be yourself, be happy?

103
00:06:43,762 --> 00:06:45,303
I wish too.

104
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:48,720
Be happy...

105
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:51,088
Excuse me, it's time to close.

106
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,219
Sorry.

107
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:06,129
Miss.

108
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:07,630
In lightning speed,

109
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,754
we've transferred your phone's data.

110
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:10,838
Take a look.

111
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:15,296
How do I unlock it?

112
00:07:15,386 --> 00:07:19,553
The factory setting for this phone
is like the M shape,

113
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,672
just make an "M" to unlock it.

114
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:22,753
If you have anything
against the word,

115
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,046
you may as well change it
when you get home.

116
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:26,261
Go online and see if it works now.

117
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:29,088
Perfect, all done.

118
00:07:29,178 --> 00:07:30,588
"Why are you still single?"

119
00:07:30,678 --> 00:07:32,636
Why are you still single?

120
00:07:38,094 --> 00:07:40,171
Because I love myself the most.

121
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:43,505
I overthink things
and it's hard to love someone new.

122
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:46,630
Because I can't handle
another betrayal.

123
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,546
Because I don't want to
sacrifice so much for someone else.

124
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,178
Freedom!

125
00:07:57,886 --> 00:08:00,178
- Another bottle, handsome?
- Thanks.

126
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:05,713
"Adam Cheung"

127
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:07,643
"We held hands for the first time
8 years ago."

128
00:08:07,843 --> 00:08:09,505
I'll treat your mother better,

129
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:12,254
I won't drive drunk and buying
those raisin cookies anymore.

130
00:08:12,344 --> 00:08:13,588
All the mistakes
I made in that book,

131
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:14,546
I'll never make them again.

132
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:15,762
Believe me.

133
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,129
Once, I had the love of a lifetime,

134
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:21,879
- but I didn't treasure it!
- Oh, forget it.

135
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,505
You guys broke up a year ago,

136
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:26,588
you don't have to
act brokenhearted forever, right?

137
00:08:26,678 --> 00:08:30,213
Right now, you ought to be happy.

138
00:08:30,303 --> 00:08:33,753
You've just escaped
a maximum security prison.

139
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:35,713
Just because of leaving
a bottle of beer behind,

140
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:38,053
you don't have to go back
in the cell for it, dummy!

141
00:08:39,762 --> 00:08:40,843
One of this, please.

142
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:43,636
- Me, too.
- Thank you.

143
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:46,004
Where's Francis?

144
00:08:46,094 --> 00:08:47,630
I guess his wife
didn't grant him a release then.

145
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,129
You have to understand,

146
00:08:49,219 --> 00:08:51,754
having the freedom to watch football
is some kind of bliss.

147
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:53,505
We used to be happy, too.

148
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:55,380
When we watched games at his place,

149
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,213
Eva used to take such good
care of us and served us drinks.

150
00:08:58,303 --> 00:08:59,463
She even made us instant noodles
whenever we are hungry,

151
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:01,213
and no to mention
that crispy chicken!

152
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:02,672
So delicious!

153
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:05,630
As if to have a friend
with a girlfriend

154
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,713
that can cook as well as her,

155
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:07,672
do you know how hard it is?

156
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:12,927
Look, we're here to watch football
and other ball-shaped objects.

157
00:09:15,553 --> 00:09:16,754
What a ball game!

158
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:17,837
- Thanks, guys.
- You're the real winner.

159
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:19,094
Such a nice ball game.

160
00:09:20,053 --> 00:09:23,380
- You didn't even take a peek?
- They were spilling out.

161
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,636
- You can keep them.
- Sure.

162
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:28,470
You pulled a prison break?

163
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,338
No, my wife and her mother
are away visiting family.

164
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:32,879
Good thing that
I didn't have to go with them.

165
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:34,254
So once I dropped them
off at the airport,

166
00:09:34,344 --> 00:09:36,171
I came straight here
to see you rascals.

167
00:09:36,261 --> 00:09:37,672
It's really been a while, rascal.

168
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:38,672
Yeah.

169
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:41,505
The last time I saw you,
you were just a little fat.

170
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:43,837
- Now you've really blown up.
- Get off, man.

171
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:45,753
Dude, you just wanted a girl, right?

172
00:09:45,843 --> 00:09:47,046
Why did you get married?

173
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:48,713
There are so many dating apps
out there.

174
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:49,630
What I mean is,

175
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,796
you can't give up
all the functions on your phone

176
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:53,505
for a single app.

177
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:55,380
But I really do love my wife,

178
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,296
and I gained weight
because I'm happy.

179
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,595
And I enjoy being ordered around,
what do you care?

180
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:02,843
Second half's starting soon,
so shut up.

181
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,720
We've already lost
in the first half.

182
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:08,837
They'll catch up in the second half,

183
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:10,837
that's what makes the game
so exciting, right?

184
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:13,296
He lost 77-0 to Eva
in the first half.

185
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:15,470
- You try catching up!
- Come on.

186
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:17,338
It's your fault
for getting caught red-handed.

187
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:19,213
The very night
you split up with Eva,

188
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:20,171
you brought a girl home.

189
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:21,753
- You deserved what you got.
- I don't agree.

190
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:22,796
He was drunk,

191
00:10:22,886 --> 00:10:25,672
and he was technically broken up
with Eva at the time.

192
00:10:25,762 --> 00:10:31,296
Girls always expect you to go
through a mourning period like them.

193
00:10:31,386 --> 00:10:33,463
If you bring a girl home
within the first 7 days,

194
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:35,136
you're disrespecting the dead!

195
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,254
Drink up and shut up.

196
00:10:38,344 --> 00:10:39,879
Drink up, you two.

197
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:40,963
You're talking too much.

198
00:10:41,969 --> 00:10:44,505
You know, I use an apology app
on my wife all the time.

199
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:45,803
You should take a look.

200
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:48,837
That's absurd!

201
00:11:21,636 --> 00:11:22,927
Mom, I'm back.

202
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:25,011
Welcome home.

203
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:29,088
How are you feeling today?

204
00:11:29,178 --> 00:11:30,386
Is your stomach better?

205
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:33,837
What about you?

206
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,511
You can't skip your medication.

207
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:40,969
Those pills are making me drowsy
all the time.

208
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:44,178
What have we done to deserve this?

209
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:48,219
Me with the depression
and you with the stomach problem.

210
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:52,129
You really should move,

211
00:11:52,219 --> 00:11:53,753
and live in
a more comfortable place.

212
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:56,843
What for? This is my home.

213
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:00,553
Some tasks are a little hard
without a man around, that's all.

214
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:05,011
Everyone uses those
T5 energy conserving bulbs now,

215
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:07,879
these fluorescent lights
are old and hard to buy.

216
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:13,011
I asked your dad to change them,
but he refused to.

217
00:12:14,094 --> 00:12:15,178
Got it.

218
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,796
Mom, dad's been gone for so long.

219
00:12:19,886 --> 00:12:21,963
If you need to cry,
you can do it in the living room.

220
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:24,171
It's so stuffy in the kitchen,

221
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:26,505
women don't have to
suffer like this anymore.

222
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:28,463
I'm not suffering.

223
00:12:28,553 --> 00:12:30,011
I told you,

224
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:34,921
I may have married the wrong man,
but I had the right daughter.

225
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:38,713
But you've devoted your whole life
to your husband and daughter,

226
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:41,927
you ought to do something
for yourself and be happy.

227
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:44,595
I'm happy if you're happy.

228
00:12:49,762 --> 00:12:52,380
By the way, I'm going
to the UK and see Daisy tomorrow.

229
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,837
I won't be around
to take care of you,

230
00:12:53,927 --> 00:12:55,428
so you should call up your friends.

231
00:12:57,927 --> 00:13:01,171
I don't need friends,
they're so annoying.

232
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,011
There's bound to be an exception.

233
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:07,803
Well, there's one.

234
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:11,762
But I haven't seen him in decades,

235
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:13,963
and I don't even have his number.

236
00:13:14,053 --> 00:13:16,296
It's easy
to find someone these days,

237
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:18,088
give me the name
and I'll find him for you.

238
00:13:18,178 --> 00:13:19,713
It's that easy?

239
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:21,094
His name is Tsang Po-wah.

240
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:23,470
Tsang Po-wah?

241
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:24,969
Well, never mind.

242
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:28,428
It's been decades, I don't even know
if he's still alive.

243
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:31,338
Remember to bring
your stomach medicine.

244
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:33,338
Alright, I got it.

245
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:35,053
Need anything from the UK?

246
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:38,636
I have to spend
my money somewhere...

247
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:46,094
"Sorry App"

248
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:00,428
I'm sorry, Eva.

249
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:08,511
I'm sorry, Eva.

250
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:12,837
This is so stupid!

251
00:14:51,844 --> 00:14:52,753
Let's go that way.

252
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:55,713
We're trying to find our way,
this isn't a maze.

253
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:58,178
- You can't just guess a way out.
- Let's just go!

254
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:24,428
Let me help you,
or you'll hurt your hip again.

255
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:29,969
Did you bring your passport?
You know how forgetful you are.

256
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:32,843
Of course I did.

257
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:36,047
Wait, no way!

258
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:38,421
I told you, you're always like this.

259
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:40,303
It's not your first time missing...

260
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:44,386
I knew you'd throw a tantrum.

261
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,386
We're in a rush, stop playing!

262
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:50,005
Let me help you.

263
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:51,969
- Thanks.
- Okay.

264
00:16:26,094 --> 00:16:28,178
"Chats"

265
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:33,879
"Speak now"

266
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:35,303
"Tap to stop"

267
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:37,047
Eva.

268
00:16:37,844 --> 00:16:39,720
Do you know what today is?

269
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,428
It's not the anniversary
of our first meeting,

270
00:16:45,053 --> 00:16:47,428
nor the anniversary
of the first time we held hands.

271
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:51,178
It's the first anniversary
of our breakup.

272
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:55,511
In the past year,

273
00:16:56,011 --> 00:16:58,511
I keep feeling like
I've lost something,

274
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:03,219
which feel like I've lost myself.

275
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:09,595
I don't know what I can do to
make you forgive me the 78th time,

276
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:14,094
but if you do give me
one more chance,

277
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,843
I won't let you down.

278
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:31,046
Next, please.

279
00:17:31,136 --> 00:17:32,546
"Plaza Premium Lounge"

280
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,505
- Hello, Miss.
- Excuse me.

281
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,713
My phone's out of battery,
where can I charge it?

282
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:38,338
We have a temporary charging
station inside.

283
00:17:38,428 --> 00:17:40,428
- Great, thank you.
- You can go in now, Thank you.

284
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:04,546
- Marvel!
- Sorry...

285
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:06,219
It's okay, she's harmless.

286
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:07,886
This is for you.

287
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:09,380
Thank you.

288
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,380
I remember you, you're Melody.

289
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,553
Marvel is now in a rush.

290
00:18:12,762 --> 00:18:14,011
We should go now.

291
00:18:19,344 --> 00:18:22,011
Marvel, I have some bad news.

292
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,136
My parents are getting divorced,
what should I do?

293
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:28,219
How can I go on like this?

294
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:30,303
How can I be happy again?

295
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,886
Yours, Melody.

296
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,136
Thank you.

297
00:18:51,178 --> 00:18:53,511
I didn't know girls still do
knitting these days.

298
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:57,595
This is for a special person.

299
00:18:58,219 --> 00:18:59,344
A special one?

300
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:02,754
Oh, for your kid, right?

301
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:04,338
No...

302
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:06,094
For my friend's kid.

303
00:19:07,053 --> 00:19:09,129
You must be very patient

304
00:19:09,219 --> 00:19:12,011
Kind and old school.

305
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,421
You must be very neat
and sentimental.

306
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:20,136
Me? Sentimental?

307
00:19:20,969 --> 00:19:23,844
You look sad
holding the paper heart over there.

308
00:19:24,886 --> 00:19:26,844
You mean the origami?

309
00:19:28,178 --> 00:19:30,963
I shouldn't say this,
but you look familiar.

310
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:33,171
Sir, flight HW77.

311
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:34,338
Last call for boarding.

312
00:19:34,428 --> 00:19:36,678
- Oh, I gotta go.
- Thank you.

313
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:44,219
Oh, my phone.

314
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,136
Bye...

315
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:52,428
Thank you very much.

316
00:20:13,553 --> 00:20:16,178
- Mrs Lui.
- They're writing parking tickets.

317
00:20:18,678 --> 00:20:19,672
It's okay.

318
00:20:24,428 --> 00:20:26,428
I've seen your car around
a few times.

319
00:20:26,927 --> 00:20:29,463
I really don't get
how you young people think.

320
00:20:29,553 --> 00:20:32,879
Once you lose touch with someone
back then, it was for good.

321
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:34,213
But it's so easy to find people now,

322
00:20:34,303 --> 00:20:37,386
you can just make a call
or find them on the internet.

323
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:41,053
This is useless
to sit around doing nothing.

324
00:20:43,303 --> 00:20:44,297
Mrs Lui!

325
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:46,088
Mrs Lui!

326
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,844
"Eva's phone"

327
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:05,088
Hello.

328
00:21:34,303 --> 00:21:35,386
What's going on?

329
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:37,762
Everything's in Thai.

330
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:41,553
My phone.

331
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,011
Bye...

332
00:21:47,844 --> 00:21:48,838
Thank you very much.

333
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,595
No way...

334
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,296
Eva.

335
00:21:57,386 --> 00:21:58,753
Do you know what today is?

336
00:21:58,843 --> 00:22:00,421
It's not the anniversary
of our first meeting,

337
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:02,505
nor the anniversary
of the first time we held hands.

338
00:22:02,595 --> 00:22:04,296
It's the first anniversary
of our breakup.

339
00:22:04,386 --> 00:22:05,254
In the past year,

340
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:08,094
I keep feeling
like I've lost something...

341
00:22:21,844 --> 00:22:25,470
"Happy 100 days"

342
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:36,136
This is for you.

343
00:22:36,595 --> 00:22:38,219
This is lovely, did you knit this?

344
00:22:39,428 --> 00:22:40,630
That's so thoughtful.

345
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,546
It's not like people
who is giving gold accessories

346
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:43,796
that I don't even know
what I'm supposed to do with them!

347
00:22:43,886 --> 00:22:45,505
- Hi, ladies.
- It's beauitful...

348
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:46,796
- Hi, baby...
- Hi...

349
00:22:46,886 --> 00:22:48,254
Do you mind if I steal the princess?

350
00:22:48,344 --> 00:22:49,171
- Hi.
- Of course, that's a good idea.

351
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:51,129
- Is that alright?
- Let daddy have our little princess.

352
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:52,344
Yeah, thank you.

353
00:22:52,844 --> 00:22:54,421
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Go to daddy.

354
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:55,713
- Bye.
- Thanks, daddy.

355
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:56,797
Bye, Daisy.

356
00:22:57,927 --> 00:22:59,837
I'm amazed that
you had the time to knit the hat.

357
00:22:59,927 --> 00:23:02,004
The baby's head is so small,
I got it done on the plane.

358
00:23:02,094 --> 00:23:02,963
So?

359
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:04,421
Have you located my phone yet?

360
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:05,754
Not yet.

361
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:08,879
If your phone is off,
there's no way to track it.

362
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:10,678
Maybe he's still on the plane.

363
00:23:11,386 --> 00:23:13,843
- What should I do?
- How did you mess that up?

364
00:23:14,011 --> 00:23:16,796
How did you switch your phone
with a Thai guy anyway?

365
00:23:16,886 --> 00:23:19,921
So I guess you can call this
a "Tom Yum Phone"!

366
00:23:20,011 --> 00:23:21,296
That's a terrible joke.

367
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:24,753
Was he trying to steal your phone
or steal your heart?

368
00:23:24,843 --> 00:23:26,763
- What are you talking about?
- Steal your heart.

369
00:23:27,094 --> 00:23:29,837
Hey, look at this.
These photos are pretty cool.

370
00:23:29,927 --> 00:23:31,386
- Let me see.
- What's that?

371
00:23:31,636 --> 00:23:33,844
- That looks familiar.
- Is that's the Star Ferry Pier?

372
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:40,843
- Oh, "A Brokenhearted Dolphin".
- How do you know?

373
00:23:43,969 --> 00:23:49,886
And this is "Lazy Afternoon",
that's the name of the piece.

374
00:23:51,843 --> 00:23:56,094
The guy who made this
is named the Space-time Intruder.

375
00:23:56,511 --> 00:24:00,713
Even to this day,
no one knows who he is.

376
00:24:00,803 --> 00:24:03,338
But he's already intruded
over 35 cities

377
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:05,338
and left 890 intruder pieces.

378
00:24:05,428 --> 00:24:07,386
There are 75 in Hong Kong alone.

379
00:24:08,219 --> 00:24:09,837
How did you not know this?

380
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:10,921
I don't care who he is.

381
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:13,046
Putting stickers
on buildings like that

382
00:24:13,136 --> 00:24:14,546
is against the law.

383
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:15,879
He's only in trouble
if he gets caught,

384
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:18,178
and who is just conquered Central
last week.

385
00:24:18,843 --> 00:24:22,046
Maybe the phone doesn't actually
belong to that Intruder guy,

386
00:24:22,136 --> 00:24:23,463
but just a fan of him instead?

387
00:24:23,553 --> 00:24:24,421
It doesn't matter.

388
00:24:24,511 --> 00:24:26,046
If he's handsome,

389
00:24:26,136 --> 00:24:28,136
then this is awfully romantic!

390
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:29,421
Think about it.

391
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,753
The same phone model
with the same pattern lock.

392
00:24:32,843 --> 00:24:33,672
It's fate.

393
00:24:33,762 --> 00:24:36,129
That's fate, I totally agree.

394
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:37,254
I've looked into this.

395
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:38,963
Of all lock patterns on this phone,

396
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:41,505
there are 389,112 possible ways.

397
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:44,344
For two people to have
the exact same lock pattern,

398
00:24:44,803 --> 00:24:45,879
this is just destiny.

399
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:48,505
The lock pattern
was the factory setting,

400
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:50,254
and the very destiny
that you're talking about

401
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:52,464
only happened because
I didn't have time to change it.

402
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:56,129
I have an idea.

403
00:24:56,219 --> 00:24:57,754
Why don't we check on the messages

404
00:24:57,844 --> 00:25:00,046
of this Tom Yum Phone?

405
00:25:00,136 --> 00:25:02,380
No way, it's an invasion of privacy.

406
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,380
Sorry, ladies.

407
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,754
I think our little baby
just made a mess,

408
00:25:05,844 --> 00:25:06,753
could you give me a hand?

409
00:25:06,843 --> 00:25:07,843
I have to go upstairs.

410
00:25:08,344 --> 00:25:09,511
- Sorry.
- See you later.

411
00:25:17,178 --> 00:25:19,053
Hello, Eva!

412
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:24,053
I'm fine, thank you.

413
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,428
She didn't say "How are you?"

414
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:30,046
It's been four whole seasons
since we last met,

415
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:31,754
I'm sure that
you've missed me very much.

416
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:32,927
Excuse me.

417
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:36,046
I'll wait here for you.

418
00:25:36,136 --> 00:25:39,338
- Why are you calling my phone?
- Hello.

419
00:25:39,428 --> 00:25:41,753
- Eva, Adam is looking for you.
- Hello?

420
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:43,837
- Ask him what he wants.
- She'd like to know what you want.

421
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:44,921
Hello, what is it?

422
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:47,843
What's the matter with you guys?

423
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:49,296
The Thai guy called,

424
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:51,713
and says he can go to Hong Kong
to switch the phones back.

425
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:52,927
Really? When?

426
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:55,713
He didn't mention about it,
but he said he'll call again.

427
00:25:55,803 --> 00:25:58,053
Eva, Adam says
that your mother's in the hospital.

428
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:02,553
Okay, thank you.

429
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:06,963
You won't be able to get on
a flight tonight, it's full.

430
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:09,754
The ticketing agent says the
earliest flight back is tomorrow.

431
00:26:09,844 --> 00:26:12,344
It's done, let's pack up
and go to the airport.

432
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:22,421
Miss Lui.

433
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:23,753
This rose is from

434
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:27,004
Mr Tang's winery in Champagne,
Chateau du Tang.

435
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:29,129
This rose is called "All My Loving",

436
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:31,129
It's grown exclusively
at Mr Tang's rose garden.

437
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:34,129
This is a 77 percent cocoa
dark chocolate,

438
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:37,088
the latest from
NT and The Chocolate Factory.

439
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,553
- You can leave while you're done.
- Yes, sir.

440
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:42,969
Eva, guess what
this chocolate is called.

441
00:26:44,344 --> 00:26:46,261
It looks like...

442
00:26:47,094 --> 00:26:50,753
"A melty tear",
like a melting teardrop.

443
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,219
I'm romantic, aren't I?

444
00:26:53,595 --> 00:26:55,088
I'm sorry, Mr Tang,

445
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:56,713
for having to fly me
back to Hong Kong.

446
00:26:56,803 --> 00:26:57,672
I'll pay you back for the flight.

447
00:26:57,762 --> 00:26:59,879
If I make you pay me back,
then I'd be really sorry.

448
00:26:59,969 --> 00:27:01,796
You're so much poorer than me.

449
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,213
Money is of no object to me,

450
00:27:03,303 --> 00:27:05,796
I value my time
and effort far above that.

451
00:27:05,886 --> 00:27:09,254
Just take some time
to focus on the now,

452
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:13,046
and get ready to enjoy
the entertainment I've prepared.

453
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:14,088
Are we watching a movie?

454
00:27:14,178 --> 00:27:15,296
I like watching movies.

455
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:16,754
I don't talk when I watch movies.

456
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,386
Brilliant minds think alike.

457
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:20,879
The best entertainment
is chatting with me.

458
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:21,796
So let's chat,

459
00:27:21,886 --> 00:27:22,880
and you may start now.

460
00:27:23,886 --> 00:27:27,762
- Then, why don't we tell jokes?
- Good idea.

461
00:27:28,011 --> 00:27:29,837
Once, I bought some expensive
caterpillar fungus

462
00:27:29,927 --> 00:27:32,754
and I asked my domestic worker
to cook it.

463
00:27:32,844 --> 00:27:34,921
She brought it over to me,

464
00:27:35,011 --> 00:27:37,129
but I'd actually bought it
for the dog.

465
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:40,136
I can't believe that
she had no idea, isn't that funny?

466
00:27:42,178 --> 00:27:43,303
Your turn.

467
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:49,129
I don't have many...

468
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:51,171
That's hilarious!

469
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:52,470
That's a good one.

470
00:27:56,636 --> 00:27:58,553
It's fun to tell jokes.

471
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:04,219
But I'd like to talk to you
about some romantic things,

472
00:28:04,927 --> 00:28:08,636
do you know what GDP stands for?

473
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:12,303
- Gross Domestic Product?
- Good answer.

474
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:14,713
Let me tell you a story.

475
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:16,338
Once there were two economists

476
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,753
named Adam and Smith,

477
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:21,129
they were taking a stroll together
when they spotted a drop of dog poo.

478
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:22,879
Adam says to Smith,

479
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:25,046
"If you eat it,
I'll give you a million dollars."

480
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,254
Smith really eats it,
so Adam gave him a million bucks.

481
00:28:28,344 --> 00:28:31,879
Then, they kept on strolling until
they spotted a drop of cat poo.

482
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:33,879
This time, Smith says to Adam,

483
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:35,046
"If you eat it,"

484
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:36,963
"I'll give you back
your million dollars."

485
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:38,254
So Adam eats it,

486
00:28:38,344 --> 00:28:41,796
and Smith really does return
the million bucks.

487
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,004
Well, that's dumb.

488
00:28:43,094 --> 00:28:45,921
No one made any money,
but they both ate poo.

489
00:28:46,011 --> 00:28:49,546
But that's not how economists think.

490
00:28:49,636 --> 00:28:52,129
It's true that no one ate money
and both of them ate poo,

491
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:55,004
but the GDP went up by 2 million.

492
00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:57,171
Everyone feels richer for it.

493
00:28:57,261 --> 00:28:58,927
I'm such a romantic, aren't I?

494
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:03,927
I'm sleepy,
I'm going to get some sleep.

495
00:29:09,386 --> 00:29:11,428
You really look like my dead mother.

496
00:29:13,178 --> 00:29:15,843
Not when your eyes are opened,
but when they're closed.

497
00:29:18,803 --> 00:29:20,762
She looked just like that
when she died.

498
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,136
She didn't toss around,

499
00:29:26,927 --> 00:29:28,470
and breathed less.

500
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:31,470
Then, her heart stopped, too.

501
00:29:35,011 --> 00:29:36,963
Your husband died
such an unjust death!

502
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:38,171
How can you die so early?

503
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:40,338
Our flat isn't
even paid off yet, son!

504
00:29:40,428 --> 00:29:41,969
Sit down...

505
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:46,754
- He, he's dead now!
- What will we do about the flat?

506
00:29:46,844 --> 00:29:48,470
- Eva.
- Where's Mom?

507
00:29:49,261 --> 00:29:50,255
Come with me.

508
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,713
- Mom.
- You're back already?

509
00:29:52,803 --> 00:29:54,421
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

510
00:29:54,511 --> 00:29:55,463
What did the doctor say?

511
00:29:55,553 --> 00:29:56,796
He says it's a spell of anaemia,

512
00:29:56,886 --> 00:29:58,921
but I think it's better
to get more tests.

513
00:29:59,011 --> 00:30:01,630
- Thank you, Adam.
- You're welcome.

514
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,754
Thank my family's domestic worker
for this.

515
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,129
When my mother was in the hospital,

516
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:08,129
she made soup for her, too.

517
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:09,213
Thanks.

518
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,511
- I'll get you some water.
- Let me.

519
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:17,421
The doctor is coming
on his rounds anytime now,

520
00:30:17,511 --> 00:30:19,595
so you can talk to him directly.

521
00:30:24,053 --> 00:30:25,886
Hey, sit down.

522
00:30:28,762 --> 00:30:31,969
Adam always hangs
around downstairs waiting for you,

523
00:30:32,843 --> 00:30:34,219
but he didn't want you to know.

524
00:30:35,636 --> 00:30:37,428
He brought you to the hospital?

525
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:41,553
- I'm fine.
- You should lie down.

526
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,213
Would you like dessert?

527
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,753
We have two choices,

528
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:50,927
blackcurrants cake and macaron.

529
00:30:51,595 --> 00:30:53,421
Definitely not
the blackcurrents cake,

530
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:55,553
you don't eat processed fruits.

531
00:30:56,386 --> 00:30:57,837
Two macarons, please.

532
00:30:57,927 --> 00:30:59,762
- Sure, two macarons.
- Thanks...

533
00:31:03,386 --> 00:31:05,053
How did you lose your phone?

534
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:08,296
It's unbelievable,

535
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:10,470
good thing you knew to call Cat.

536
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,386
Two macarons, thank you.

537
00:31:14,011 --> 00:31:15,261
- Thanks...
- Enjoy.

538
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:19,505
Have mine too,

539
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:20,837
I know you like it.

540
00:31:25,219 --> 00:31:26,969
So, how have you been?

541
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,162
My father and stepmom moved back
to Vancouver for retirement,

542
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:34,261
and he sold his shares
in the law firm to his partners.

543
00:31:37,803 --> 00:31:39,296
You know me,

544
00:31:39,386 --> 00:31:41,879
I never liked working
in my dad's firm.

545
00:31:41,969 --> 00:31:44,762
Besides, mergers and acquisitions
work isn't for me too.

546
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:48,511
That's good, you can keep
teaching kickboxing then.

547
00:31:49,136 --> 00:31:50,219
I already am.

548
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:54,178
As long as you're happy.

549
00:31:56,386 --> 00:31:58,129
But I'm also trying new things.

550
00:31:58,219 --> 00:31:59,428
Like what?

551
00:32:01,094 --> 00:32:02,338
Sorry...

552
00:32:02,428 --> 00:32:04,879
I'm interrogating you like a mom.

553
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:06,546
Never mind, go ahead.

554
00:32:06,636 --> 00:32:09,076
It's been forever since someone
asked me questions like these.

555
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,338
Sorry, it's time for last order,

556
00:32:11,428 --> 00:32:12,678
would you like anything else?

557
00:32:13,094 --> 00:32:14,088
I'm full.

558
00:32:14,553 --> 00:32:16,219
- The check, please.
- Sure, thank you.

559
00:32:19,678 --> 00:32:20,672
Thanks.

560
00:32:21,844 --> 00:32:22,753
Are you okay?

561
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:25,595
Just some gas,
I'll be fine after I take my pills.

562
00:32:32,303 --> 00:32:34,254
Say, did you receive
my text message?

563
00:32:34,344 --> 00:32:35,762
What message?

564
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:41,505
Never mind.

565
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:48,004
Is there any doubt?

566
00:32:48,094 --> 00:32:51,344
I'm 100 percent sure that he wants
to win you back with that message.

567
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:55,254
He's been on probation for a year,
it's time to absolve him now.

568
00:32:55,344 --> 00:32:59,088
Feelings change, but people don't.

569
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:01,219
What will you do, Eva?

570
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:04,171
Nothing,
I'll just take the world as it is.

571
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:07,753
- I want to see a happy ending!
- No way.

572
00:33:07,843 --> 00:33:10,261
Adam should've known better,
am I right?

573
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:12,171
It's good to stay single,

574
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:14,546
live worry-free
and you can go anywhere you want.

575
00:33:14,636 --> 00:33:16,129
You're just boring,

576
00:33:16,219 --> 00:33:17,539
I'm going to ignore your opinion.

577
00:33:17,636 --> 00:33:20,088
I have the longest CV
when it comes to relationships,

578
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:21,004
just trust me on this.

579
00:33:21,094 --> 00:33:23,470
Oh, shut up already.
You think you're a judge?

580
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:26,254
Court...

581
00:33:26,344 --> 00:33:28,595
- The trial is in session.
- A trial?

582
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:30,672
Are you kidding me?

583
00:33:30,762 --> 00:33:31,636
Silence!

584
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:32,753
Your Honor,

585
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:35,511
I object to our Plaintiff
getting back with the Defendant.

586
00:33:37,428 --> 00:33:38,672
In the words of Albert Einstein,

587
00:33:38,762 --> 00:33:41,046
"A woman who repeats
the same mistake"

588
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:42,338
"will suffer the same fate,"

589
00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:44,713
"no matter
how many times she tries."

590
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:46,386
When did Einstein say that?

591
00:33:46,844 --> 00:33:48,380
Your Honor, I hold evidence

592
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,879
proving that the Plaintiff still
misses the Defendant.

593
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:52,843
Even your phone still misses Adam?

594
00:33:54,344 --> 00:33:56,004
I wanna help my Best-friend-forever
to pick a wedding dress.

595
00:33:56,094 --> 00:33:58,546
Objection, I don't want to wear
another bridesmaid dress!

596
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,380
Besides, I don't get
why people still get married.

597
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,338
Your Honor,

598
00:34:01,428 --> 00:34:05,595
evidence shows that there are plenty
of great guys waiting for her.

599
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:09,505
For example,
my crazy rich boss, NT Tang.

600
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:12,046
Everyone, for the Plaintiff.

601
00:34:12,136 --> 00:34:13,004
Money is not
the most important thing.

602
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:16,129
The most important thing is
that modern women have a choice,

603
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:17,754
it's no crime to be single!

604
00:34:17,844 --> 00:34:19,004
Yet, a lot of women
search day and night,

605
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:20,088
only to still end up with scraps.

606
00:34:20,178 --> 00:34:21,963
Let's hear some objective facts
from the Plaintiff.

607
00:34:22,053 --> 00:34:24,546
We have to consider the
Plaintiff's best interest.

608
00:34:24,636 --> 00:34:26,963
I see her in the office every day,

609
00:34:27,053 --> 00:34:28,004
I'm the only one
who truly understands her.

610
00:34:28,094 --> 00:34:29,380
- No, I understand her the most.
- I understand her so much more.

611
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,553
Silence!

612
00:34:31,511 --> 00:34:34,428
Or I'll disbar all of you.

613
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,636
Eva Lui, what do you
have to say for yourself?

614
00:34:40,803 --> 00:34:45,011
I want to tell the world
at this moment that you, Eva Lui,

615
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:48,178
taught me all about...

616
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:55,843
Love!

617
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,636
I, Eva Lui, want to tell the world

618
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:02,762
that the only person I love
is my mother.

619
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,172
Lin?

620
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:15,464
Is that Lin?

621
00:35:17,011 --> 00:35:18,303
Po-wah!

622
00:35:18,511 --> 00:35:19,505
Are you Po-wah?

623
00:35:20,595 --> 00:35:22,428
I've been looking for you
for 40 years!

624
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:25,219
You haven't changed one bit.

625
00:35:25,595 --> 00:35:29,004
- Your eyes are just getting old.
- No way.

626
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:31,494
I just had the cataract surgery
last year, and I am good now.

627
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:35,595
We've both grown so old.

628
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:38,921
I'm so happy.

629
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,921
If we hadn't come in
for maintenance at the same time,

630
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:42,511
we wouldn't have met again.

631
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:45,261
Just a coincidence, that's all.

632
00:35:46,803 --> 00:35:51,553
To be honest, after losing touch
all those years ago,

633
00:35:52,428 --> 00:35:55,844
I never found another girlfriend
as compatible as you.

634
00:35:58,094 --> 00:36:00,762
- How have you been?
- I've been well.

635
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:03,713
I have a daughter,
she's all grown up now.

636
00:36:03,803 --> 00:36:04,796
She's a lawyer.

637
00:36:04,886 --> 00:36:05,880
Here.

638
00:36:06,386 --> 00:36:07,470
I'll show you.

639
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:09,797
She's awfully pretty.

640
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:10,963
Like you.

641
00:36:12,553 --> 00:36:16,219
This guy is the boyfriend
she's always arguing with.

642
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:23,963
Why did you pick him?

643
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:25,636
My mother made the call.

644
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,178
I went on a lot of arranged dates.

645
00:36:29,178 --> 00:36:30,511
Out of all the guys I met,

646
00:36:31,595 --> 00:36:34,136
he's the one
that looked the most like you.

647
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:43,843
Did he treat you as well as I did?

648
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:46,754
For better or worse,
we had a life together.

649
00:36:46,844 --> 00:36:48,511
It went by in the blink of an eye.

650
00:36:50,762 --> 00:36:51,969
He's passed away now.

651
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:54,762
I don't know
how long I'll last, either.

652
00:36:55,636 --> 00:36:56,505
Don't say that.

653
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:59,754
Hong Kong women have the longest
life expectancy in the world,

654
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:01,303
which even longer than the men.

655
00:37:03,303 --> 00:37:04,844
What are you in the hospital for?

656
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:06,879
I'll give you three choices.

657
00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:08,213
I'll buy you an ice cream
cone if you get it right.

658
00:37:08,303 --> 00:37:09,171
A, the three highs.

659
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:10,129
B, a stroke.

660
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:11,129
C, cancer.

661
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:12,254
Don't joke about that,

662
00:37:12,344 --> 00:37:14,296
I can't handle the shock.

663
00:37:14,386 --> 00:37:16,879
I'm easygoing
about my own mortality now,

664
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,713
I just miss my friends.

665
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,219
I worked as a tour guide
for 40 years.

666
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:23,088
I've been all over the world

667
00:37:23,178 --> 00:37:25,963
and I've seen all kinds of things.

668
00:37:26,053 --> 00:37:27,213
You're lucky,

669
00:37:27,303 --> 00:37:29,463
I just convince myself
I've been to a place

670
00:37:29,553 --> 00:37:31,553
after seeing it on a travel show.

671
00:37:32,511 --> 00:37:33,927
You've led a fortunate life.

672
00:37:36,595 --> 00:37:38,969
The only regret is
I couldn't marry my first love.

673
00:37:39,886 --> 00:37:42,261
Look at how old we are,
no point talking about that.

674
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:47,386
How did you end up in here, then?

675
00:37:48,553 --> 00:37:52,553
I fainted on the street,
the doctor says it's anaemia.

676
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:56,428
The tests are taking forever.

677
00:37:57,927 --> 00:37:59,546
Do you have diabetes?

678
00:37:59,636 --> 00:38:02,380
If you don't,
let's go get an ice cream gone.

679
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,796
The convenient store
in this hospital

680
00:38:03,886 --> 00:38:05,927
has that Apollo brand
that we used to love,

681
00:38:06,178 --> 00:38:07,053
how's that sound?

682
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:09,129
You're so nostalgic.

683
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:11,762
The old is new again, come on.

684
00:38:12,595 --> 00:38:13,505
Where do you live now?

685
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:16,969
- Not far from here.
- Is that so?

686
00:38:20,762 --> 00:38:22,762
- Hey, Adam.
- Sorry.

687
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:24,213
What's up?

688
00:38:24,886 --> 00:38:27,303
Your ex-student is over there.

689
00:38:27,428 --> 00:38:29,129
When I paid the tuition fee,

690
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:30,754
you guys said
that it can be refunded.

691
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:31,879
- No...
- So what should I do?

692
00:38:31,969 --> 00:38:33,546
Should I report you
to the Consumer Council?

693
00:38:33,636 --> 00:38:35,046
Company policies state that

694
00:38:35,136 --> 00:38:37,296
a refund is only possible
under special circumstances.

695
00:38:37,386 --> 00:38:38,879
According to our records,

696
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:40,921
you've never called
to make a leave of absence.

697
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:43,636
It's your trainer
that doesn't want to train me,

698
00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:46,344
I didn't even have a chance
to take a leave of absence.

699
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:48,303
- Let me handle this.
- Sure.

700
00:38:54,762 --> 00:38:56,428
Sorry,
there was a long line at the ATM.

701
00:38:57,511 --> 00:38:58,886
Your refund, please count it.

702
00:39:02,303 --> 00:39:03,553
I threw away the old one.

703
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:08,011
Clearing your debt?

704
00:39:10,011 --> 00:39:11,004
How's your Eva?

705
00:39:11,094 --> 00:39:12,636
We almost got back together,

706
00:39:12,762 --> 00:39:14,088
but your contact lens
case ruined it.

707
00:39:14,178 --> 00:39:16,088
I returned her notebook to you.

708
00:39:16,178 --> 00:39:17,386
And that contact lens case?

709
00:39:18,344 --> 00:39:20,053
Did you leave it behind on purpose?

710
00:39:21,762 --> 00:39:22,756
I don't know.

711
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,963
Even if I did,

712
00:39:25,053 --> 00:39:27,344
you should've known it wasn't Eva's.

713
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:29,421
Blame yourself for being dumb.

714
00:39:29,511 --> 00:39:30,546
Without a backup phone like me,

715
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:32,837
how would you know how much
you missed your primary phone?

716
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:34,636
All your memories, social media,

717
00:39:34,762 --> 00:39:36,129
everything important in your life

718
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:38,046
was in that primary phone,
after all.

719
00:39:38,136 --> 00:39:40,921
You were even crying "Eva..."
when you were drunk.

720
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:44,136
Anyway, be careful
meeting people next time.

721
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:52,219
I really hate you,
but I really like you, too.

722
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,803
Still got my phone number?

723
00:39:55,344 --> 00:39:56,254
I've deleted it already.

724
00:39:56,344 --> 00:39:57,338
I'm heading back now.

725
00:39:57,927 --> 00:39:59,927
It's okay, I still have your number.

726
00:40:09,053 --> 00:40:13,094
"5th, 77 Heartwarmings"

727
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:15,754
I have good news.

728
00:40:15,844 --> 00:40:20,011
I'm going to marry Mandy,
whom I've only known for 3 days.

729
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:23,053
Sorry, I'm still in love with her.

730
00:40:32,803 --> 00:40:35,344
"Message from Anon"

731
00:40:38,094 --> 00:40:39,511
"Anon"

732
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:49,261
"Loading"

733
00:40:49,927 --> 00:40:52,094
"77 Heartwarmings"

734
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,129
Marvel, get some rest.

735
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:05,713
We'll head to the airport
in three hours, okay?

736
00:41:05,803 --> 00:41:07,303
Sure, see you soon.

737
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:25,171
Dear Melody,

738
00:41:25,261 --> 00:41:27,004
if you want a happy ending,

739
00:41:27,094 --> 00:41:29,844
it depends where you want to
stop the story.

740
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:34,254
You can always start a new scene
and give it some happiness.

741
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:37,470
If you believe in it,
your dreams will come true.

742
00:41:38,136 --> 00:41:39,796
Melody is your name,

743
00:41:39,886 --> 00:41:41,927
let's play a joyful tune
in your heart.

744
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:43,213
From Marvel.

745
00:41:47,094 --> 00:41:48,713
"Tom Yum Goong"

746
00:41:48,803 --> 00:41:50,428
"I'll be in Hong Kong tomorrow"

747
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:04,011
"Let her know
what you're doing right now"

748
00:42:14,136 --> 00:42:17,720
"I'm waiting for a job interview,
I'm a little nervous"

749
00:42:36,886 --> 00:42:39,129
"I want to go to your place
to pick up some things,"

750
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:41,219
"is it okay?"

751
00:42:43,553 --> 00:42:46,261
"You can come home anytime."

752
00:42:57,762 --> 00:42:58,713
"NT Tang"

753
00:42:58,803 --> 00:42:59,921
"I want to tell you"

754
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:01,261
"that what I'm doing right now"

755
00:43:09,428 --> 00:43:13,754
Eva, what I'm doing now is called
Shitali Pranayama yoga,

756
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:15,837
it means cooling breath.

757
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,753
The key is in the breathing,

758
00:43:17,843 --> 00:43:19,296
so the nostrils are
really important.

759
00:43:19,386 --> 00:43:20,843
Come on, closer.

760
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:23,088
You must find this interesting, Eva.

761
00:43:23,178 --> 00:43:24,921
I'll show you how to do it.

762
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:26,713
Press on the right nostril

763
00:43:26,803 --> 00:43:28,505
with your left index finger
and breathe.

764
00:43:28,595 --> 00:43:32,636
One, two, three.

765
00:43:32,762 --> 00:43:36,879
Then press on the left nostril
with your right index finger.

766
00:43:36,969 --> 00:43:39,969
Let go of your left hand,
then breathe.

767
00:43:40,595 --> 00:43:43,129
One, two, three.

768
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:44,505
The last step is a little hard,

769
00:43:44,595 --> 00:43:46,837
you have to
take your two index fingers

770
00:43:46,927 --> 00:43:49,463
and press down
on both your nostrils,

771
00:43:49,553 --> 00:43:52,261
then even curl up your tongue.

772
00:43:53,886 --> 00:43:57,219
One, two, three.

773
00:44:10,595 --> 00:44:11,595
Mom.

774
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,053
You're here.

775
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:15,837
What's with all the ice cream?

776
00:44:15,927 --> 00:44:18,505
Sweets make me happy,

777
00:44:18,595 --> 00:44:21,088
and I had a nice dream last night.

778
00:44:21,178 --> 00:44:22,386
What happened?

779
00:44:22,886 --> 00:44:24,261
I dreamt your wedding.

780
00:44:26,261 --> 00:44:29,296
You know, you had a beautiful
wedding dress on.

781
00:44:29,386 --> 00:44:31,886
Just when I was about
to reach out and touch it,

782
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:34,843
that nurse woke me up.

783
00:44:37,428 --> 00:44:38,754
No, I can't do this.

784
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:42,178
Marvel, please don't be upset.

785
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:44,546
You read the script?
It's ridiculous.

786
00:44:44,636 --> 00:44:46,505
The father dies, the mother dies,

787
00:44:46,595 --> 00:44:48,713
the son dies, the daughter dies...

788
00:44:48,803 --> 00:44:50,754
I die, everybody dies.

789
00:44:50,844 --> 00:44:53,129
Exactly, we all die in the end.

790
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:56,219
Ginny, you better
talk to the studio again.

791
00:44:57,261 --> 00:45:00,254
This is no use,
the studio won't change the script

792
00:45:00,344 --> 00:45:02,213
nor will they change
the contract we signed.

793
00:45:02,303 --> 00:45:04,421
It doesn't matter
where we are heading to,

794
00:45:04,511 --> 00:45:06,380
there is only one map
to the journey of life

795
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,136
and it lives within our hearts.

796
00:45:26,011 --> 00:45:27,053
"Stage 2"

797
00:45:27,511 --> 00:45:29,963
"Move of the day"

798
00:45:30,053 --> 00:45:32,386
"Have dinner with her"

799
00:45:56,011 --> 00:45:57,005
Welcome home.

800
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,261
You're into gaming now?

801
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:08,171
And you're reading
psychology books too?

802
00:46:08,261 --> 00:46:09,636
Don't have much else to do.

803
00:46:10,344 --> 00:46:13,053
It's not like you to be this neat.

804
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:16,837
Why do you sit on the floor
instead of the sofa?

805
00:46:16,927 --> 00:46:18,011
It's easier for work.

806
00:46:18,636 --> 00:46:19,630
Like this.

807
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,171
- What's going on? Where?
- A cockroach!

808
00:46:23,261 --> 00:46:24,303
Under the monitor.

809
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,713
The neighbor didn't put the lid on
the trash bin again!

810
00:46:25,803 --> 00:46:26,921
Stay off my keyboard!

811
00:46:27,011 --> 00:46:28,088
Off the keyboard!

812
00:46:28,178 --> 00:46:30,754
- Go away...
- Not my book!

813
00:46:30,844 --> 00:46:33,886
- Don't be scared.
- Help me!

814
00:46:39,843 --> 00:46:40,753
Good thing you were here.

815
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:42,672
I was scared, too, but look at you.

816
00:46:42,762 --> 00:46:45,053
You were freaked out,
so what else was I supposed to do?

817
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,094
Do you think it's really dead?

818
00:46:48,094 --> 00:46:49,094
Wait, what are you doing?

819
00:46:49,344 --> 00:46:51,004
It's a bookmark now!

820
00:46:51,094 --> 00:46:52,796
Can I borrow your bathroom?

821
00:46:52,886 --> 00:46:54,386
It's your home, too.

822
00:46:55,261 --> 00:46:56,720
I'll give it an ocean burial.

823
00:46:58,678 --> 00:46:59,844
Then I'll go steam the fish.

824
00:47:18,094 --> 00:47:20,470
Did you see
how well he cleaned the place?

825
00:47:20,844 --> 00:47:22,546
Of course he did,
because you're not around.

826
00:47:22,636 --> 00:47:26,546
It means everything you did
were in vain.

827
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:29,338
There was a lot happening
in his family back then.

828
00:47:29,428 --> 00:47:31,879
There was his dad's divorce,
then his mom got sick.

829
00:47:31,969 --> 00:47:34,338
He was so upset,
how could I bother him?

830
00:47:34,428 --> 00:47:37,713
And now, he's got nothing better
to do than to play games.

831
00:47:37,803 --> 00:47:39,553
That's called passion.

832
00:47:39,844 --> 00:47:42,213
People need to have hobbies,
you know.

833
00:47:42,303 --> 00:47:44,754
That's not what you used to say.

834
00:47:44,844 --> 00:47:46,171
Don't say I didn't warn you.

835
00:47:46,261 --> 00:47:47,380
When a man wants you back,

836
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,546
it's natural that
he'll show you his best side.

837
00:47:49,636 --> 00:47:52,171
Once you're hooked,
he returns to his old ways.

838
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:55,046
I don't get why
you're always so negative.

839
00:47:55,136 --> 00:47:58,380
You didn't come back for your stuff,

840
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:03,046
but wanted to see if other girls
left anything in the bathroom again.

841
00:48:03,136 --> 00:48:04,463
I don't have time to argue with you,

842
00:48:04,553 --> 00:48:06,927
a steamed fish is best served hot.

843
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:50,178
Hey, what were you doing
on that bridge?

844
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:52,636
What?

845
00:48:53,136 --> 00:48:54,261
Dinner's ready.

846
00:48:56,094 --> 00:48:57,219
Let's give this a try.

847
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:11,303
Say, how did your interview go?

848
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:15,219
They said
that I gave the best answer.

849
00:49:16,094 --> 00:49:17,886
What was the question?

850
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:20,753
Imagine.

851
00:49:20,843 --> 00:49:24,879
There's a blizzard outside
while you're driving home,

852
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:26,296
and there are only
two seats in the car.

853
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:28,004
The blizzard's getting worse,

854
00:49:28,094 --> 00:49:29,837
then you drive past a bus stop.

855
00:49:29,927 --> 00:49:32,296
You know that the bus only comes
once every three hours,

856
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,421
and there are three people waiting.

857
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:37,213
The first person
is your best friend.

858
00:49:37,303 --> 00:49:40,129
The second person
is a sick old lady.

859
00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:42,754
And the third person
is your dream girl.

860
00:49:42,844 --> 00:49:45,213
Remember,
your car only has two seats.

861
00:49:45,303 --> 00:49:47,063
If you were the driver,
how would you choose?

862
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:50,678
Knowing you,
you'd drive your friend.

863
00:49:51,843 --> 00:49:52,837
Nope.

864
00:49:53,094 --> 00:49:54,004
Maybe the old lady?

865
00:49:54,094 --> 00:49:55,843
You did drive my mother
to the hospital.

866
00:49:57,470 --> 00:49:59,588
Not the dream girl, right?

867
00:49:59,678 --> 00:50:01,358
You'd fail the interview
by answering that.

868
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:04,261
Then what did you say?

869
00:50:05,178 --> 00:50:06,004
I...

870
00:50:06,094 --> 00:50:07,344
Excuse me.

871
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,762
- Hello?
- Hey, want your phone back?

872
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,338
Of course, it's very important.

873
00:50:16,428 --> 00:50:18,969
- Do you know any good lawyer?
- Yes.

874
00:50:19,678 --> 00:50:20,636
I need your help,

875
00:50:20,762 --> 00:50:22,803
please come to
Wan Chai police station.

876
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:27,470
Okay, I'm coming.

877
00:50:27,636 --> 00:50:30,136
Sorry, I have to go.

878
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,303
- Is everything okay?
- I am sorry.

879
00:50:34,344 --> 00:50:35,886
What's wrong? Do you need a ride?

880
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:38,969
No, I'll just get a taxi.

881
00:50:40,636 --> 00:50:41,843
Thanks for the dinner.

882
00:50:42,803 --> 00:50:43,797
Bye.

883
00:50:45,094 --> 00:50:46,219
Be careful.

884
00:50:50,762 --> 00:50:52,720
- You can go now.
- Okay.

885
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:55,844
- These are your belongings.
- Yes.

886
00:50:57,344 --> 00:50:58,338
Sign here.

887
00:51:13,843 --> 00:51:15,886
- Where's my...
- Thank you for bailing me out.

888
00:51:18,094 --> 00:51:19,129
Where's my phone?

889
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:20,927
Oh, yes, sure.

890
00:51:24,803 --> 00:51:25,879
I need to work tomorrow.

891
00:51:25,969 --> 00:51:28,720
If I couldn't get out,
I'd be in big trouble.

892
00:51:32,344 --> 00:51:34,754
You're already in a big trouble
in the first place,

893
00:51:34,844 --> 00:51:36,762
that's why you couldn't get out.

894
00:51:38,886 --> 00:51:39,927
Where's the lawyer?

895
00:51:41,011 --> 00:51:42,005
Me.

896
00:51:43,053 --> 00:51:45,844
Eva, please charge me.

897
00:51:46,219 --> 00:51:47,636
May I have your business card?

898
00:51:48,386 --> 00:51:49,380
Sure.

899
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:52,254
So should I bill Space-time Intruder

900
00:51:52,344 --> 00:51:53,844
or Marvel?

901
00:51:54,843 --> 00:51:56,088
You watch my movies?

902
00:51:56,178 --> 00:51:59,636
Come on, your phone advertisements
are everywhere.

903
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:02,178
Will you keep my secret?

904
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:03,630
Which one?

905
00:52:04,094 --> 00:52:07,754
You mean the real identity
of Space-time Intruder?

906
00:52:07,844 --> 00:52:11,046
Or the arrest of
the Thai movie star, Marvel?

907
00:52:11,136 --> 00:52:14,344
Listen, I can't let anyone know
about my secret.

908
00:52:14,553 --> 00:52:16,004
It would be damaging to me,

909
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:18,879
my clients, my agent and my fans.

910
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:23,004
So you're asking me
to shut up about your mistakes?

911
00:52:23,094 --> 00:52:24,463
I'm hiring you as my lawyer,

912
00:52:24,553 --> 00:52:26,463
we can sign
a confidentality agreement about it

913
00:52:26,553 --> 00:52:28,046
and you can charge me
double or triple.

914
00:52:28,136 --> 00:52:29,963
Okay, I'll consider it.

915
00:52:30,053 --> 00:52:31,047
Bye.

916
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:34,136
Hey, one more thing.

917
00:52:36,927 --> 00:52:39,344
I think you should
go back with that Adam guy.

918
00:52:40,094 --> 00:52:43,303
Wait, you checked my messages?

919
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,796
Adam's messages are sincere,

920
00:52:45,886 --> 00:52:47,004
please don't ruin the happy ending.

921
00:52:47,094 --> 00:52:49,129
You have no right
to intrude my privacy,

922
00:52:49,219 --> 00:52:51,754
and please stop telling me
what to do with my life.

923
00:52:51,844 --> 00:52:54,463
You know nothing about me,
nor anything about him.

924
00:52:54,553 --> 00:52:56,088
It's none of your business,

925
00:52:56,178 --> 00:52:58,344
I'm not even a fan of yours!

926
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:04,636
Cool, no one talks to me
like you do.

927
00:53:08,261 --> 00:53:09,754
Adam, a student's waiting for you.

928
00:53:09,844 --> 00:53:10,753
Again?

929
00:53:10,843 --> 00:53:12,463
I already gave her back her money.

930
00:53:12,553 --> 00:53:15,129
It's a new student,
he was here before we opened.

931
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:16,428
Thanks.

932
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,386
His name is Marvel,
he doesn't speak Chinese.

933
00:53:22,595 --> 00:53:23,879
- Hi.
- So you're Adam?

934
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:25,927
Yeah, and you must be Marvel.

935
00:53:26,762 --> 00:53:28,046
How do you know me?

936
00:53:28,136 --> 00:53:30,421
We have a common friend
on social media,

937
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:31,671
so I want to get to know you.

938
00:53:31,762 --> 00:53:33,129
Nice to meet you.

939
00:53:33,219 --> 00:53:35,380
- Where are you from?
- Thailand.

940
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:37,595
- Do you know Muay Thai?
- Yeah, a little bit.

941
00:53:38,178 --> 00:53:40,046
But I practice kickboxing more.

942
00:53:40,136 --> 00:53:41,130
Let's try.

943
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:42,589
Sure.

944
00:53:51,386 --> 00:53:54,046
I know him, he's a movie star!

945
00:53:54,136 --> 00:53:55,927
No wonder he looks so familiar.

946
00:54:02,053 --> 00:54:03,844
He doesn't look like
he's here to learn.

947
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:05,921
He's here to pick a fight.

948
00:54:06,011 --> 00:54:07,171
Show me your kickboxing.

949
00:54:07,261 --> 00:54:08,386
Show me your Muay Thai.

950
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:42,219
You're not looking for a teacher,

951
00:54:43,803 --> 00:54:45,386
you're looking for a contender.

952
00:54:46,386 --> 00:54:48,720
It's not easy
to find a contender like you.

953
00:54:49,011 --> 00:54:50,005
Same here.

954
00:54:51,053 --> 00:54:52,553
- See you next time.
- Sure.

955
00:55:09,636 --> 00:55:12,213
You haven't changed one bit,
who is still eating too slow.

956
00:55:12,303 --> 00:55:13,754
You haven't changed, either.

957
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:17,636
Still eating too fast,
and getting it all over your mouth.

958
00:55:19,844 --> 00:55:22,213
Ice cream melts, doesn't it?

959
00:55:22,303 --> 00:55:23,254
Every ice cream cone

960
00:55:23,344 --> 00:55:25,338
is like a race against time.

961
00:55:25,428 --> 00:55:26,963
And who won?

962
00:55:27,053 --> 00:55:28,047
Well, you see?

963
00:55:28,386 --> 00:55:30,796
In all my years
of traveling around the world

964
00:55:30,886 --> 00:55:31,879
and meeting different people,

965
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:33,380
no one's ever beaten time.

966
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:37,344
That's why you should savor it,
make it worth your while.

967
00:55:42,553 --> 00:55:43,547
Lin.

968
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:48,837
We'd agreed to elope back then,
why didn't you show up?

969
00:55:48,927 --> 00:55:50,178
My family was against it.

970
00:55:51,843 --> 00:55:53,303
We can't be selfish.

971
00:55:57,927 --> 00:56:00,636
Since then, I'd miss you
whenever I eat an ice cream cone

972
00:56:01,762 --> 00:56:02,927
and wherever I go.

973
00:56:05,511 --> 00:56:07,171
There's an ice cream shop in Okinawa

974
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:08,969
that I'm dying to show you.

975
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:10,843
- Take me there when I'm better.
- Sure.

976
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:15,213
Why are you so late?

977
00:56:16,886 --> 00:56:18,421
I was supposed to take my mom home,

978
00:56:18,511 --> 00:56:20,296
but she got a headache.

979
00:56:20,386 --> 00:56:22,754
So I stayed with her
while the doctor checked on her.

980
00:56:22,844 --> 00:56:23,921
It's that bad?

981
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:27,046
I don't even know
if she really has anaemia,

982
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:29,088
she told the doctor
totally different things.

983
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:31,969
Anyway, she needs to do more tests
in the hospital.

984
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:34,088
Like Spider-Man says,

985
00:56:34,178 --> 00:56:36,553
"With great power
comes great responsibility."

986
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:38,296
But I'm the opposite one.

987
00:56:38,386 --> 00:56:41,546
With great responsibilities
come great power.

988
00:56:41,636 --> 00:56:44,303
I'm not Spider-Man,
I'm just a normal human being.

989
00:56:46,762 --> 00:56:49,136
There are three surprises
for you today.

990
00:56:50,636 --> 00:56:51,630
Congratulations.

991
00:56:51,844 --> 00:56:52,796
For what?

992
00:56:52,886 --> 00:56:55,178
I've done some checking for you.

993
00:56:55,844 --> 00:56:58,011
"Move of the day, send her flowers"

994
00:56:58,136 --> 00:57:00,254
This is an app called
"77 Heartwarmings",

995
00:57:00,344 --> 00:57:01,338
which is huge right now.

996
00:57:01,886 --> 00:57:02,880
Let's see who sent them.

997
00:57:04,428 --> 00:57:05,927
NT Tang.

998
00:57:07,303 --> 00:57:08,297
Adam.

999
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,927
Anon? Who's that?

1000
00:57:15,219 --> 00:57:17,421
- Hello?
- Eva, call from the police station.

1001
00:57:17,511 --> 00:57:19,254
- Please put it on hold.
- Sure.

1002
00:57:19,344 --> 00:57:21,254
Get me the template
for the confidentiality agreement.

1003
00:57:21,344 --> 00:57:24,386
- Sure, give me the client's name.
- It's confidential.

1004
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:27,470
You and your secrecy...

1005
00:57:32,803 --> 00:57:33,797
Cut!

1006
00:57:39,219 --> 00:57:41,303
This is
the confidentality agreement.

1007
00:57:41,553 --> 00:57:44,171
Let me explain, first...

1008
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:45,713
You shouldn't sign anything

1009
00:57:45,803 --> 00:57:48,171
before you understand
the terms and conditions.

1010
00:57:48,261 --> 00:57:49,428
I trust my lawyer.

1011
00:57:50,053 --> 00:57:51,470
I appreciate that,

1012
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:54,421
but reality is not like movies.

1013
00:57:54,511 --> 00:57:57,219
You're the only person
who knows both sides of me.

1014
00:57:57,969 --> 00:58:01,011
Anyway, they won't press
any charges for now.

1015
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:02,963
So you're my lucky star.

1016
00:58:03,053 --> 00:58:06,046
But still,
the way you do art is illegal.

1017
00:58:06,136 --> 00:58:08,011
I won't bail you out next time.

1018
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:09,130
"Understand".

1019
00:58:10,178 --> 00:58:11,553
It means "I understand".

1020
00:58:15,428 --> 00:58:16,511
Let me walk you out.

1021
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:19,463
When I'm on set,

1022
00:58:19,553 --> 00:58:21,844
it feels like
I'm traveling through a time tunnel.

1023
00:58:22,053 --> 00:58:23,505
People only live once,

1024
00:58:23,595 --> 00:58:26,136
but you can live as many lives
as you want.

1025
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:28,219
You have different roles, too.

1026
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:29,714
A lawyer,

1027
00:58:30,386 --> 00:58:32,004
a daughter and a nice girlfriend.

1028
00:58:32,094 --> 00:58:33,753
Let me clarify.

1029
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,672
I'm a lawyer, you're right.

1030
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,796
I'm a good daughter, I guess.

1031
00:58:37,886 --> 00:58:39,843
But I don't have a boyfriend.

1032
00:58:40,344 --> 00:58:44,094
I guess you haven't gotten back
together with that Adam guy yet?

1033
00:58:45,511 --> 00:58:48,720
So he's the past,
welcome back to the market.

1034
00:58:50,136 --> 00:58:52,837
Chances of us being together
in this space and time,

1035
00:58:52,927 --> 00:58:54,171
this is destiny.

1036
00:58:54,261 --> 00:58:56,303
You want to
intrude space-time with me?

1037
00:58:57,303 --> 00:59:00,088
Are you asking your lawyer
to break the rules?

1038
00:59:00,178 --> 00:59:01,837
Life is about breaking rules

1039
00:59:01,927 --> 00:59:03,261
and knowing who you really are.

1040
00:59:04,636 --> 00:59:06,046
I'm going back tomorrow,

1041
00:59:06,136 --> 00:59:08,171
and I don't know
when I can see you again.

1042
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:10,219
You can text me anytime.

1043
00:59:11,094 --> 00:59:13,636
This is not a good tool
for communication,

1044
00:59:14,136 --> 00:59:16,136
it's not the way
we should stay connected.

1045
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:18,094
Then what?

1046
00:59:19,136 --> 00:59:20,886
The shadow of your smile,

1047
00:59:24,636 --> 00:59:26,094
the apple of my eye.

1048
00:59:29,136 --> 00:59:30,969
You're the sunshine of my life.

1049
00:59:35,303 --> 00:59:38,386
Perhaps you need to
break from reality.

1050
01:00:16,803 --> 01:00:20,254
Cat, please help me send
Barrister Tong's contract

1051
01:00:20,344 --> 01:00:21,762
to the Guangzhou office today.

1052
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:22,803
Yeah.

1053
01:00:22,927 --> 01:00:23,879
Also, I won't be in
the office today.

1054
01:00:23,969 --> 01:00:25,588
Call me if anything comes up.

1055
01:00:25,678 --> 01:00:27,011
Okay, bye.

1056
01:00:52,636 --> 01:00:53,636
I have to go.

1057
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,714
Bye.

1058
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:59,678
Hey, I'll come back for you.

1059
01:01:02,053 --> 01:01:03,843
It seems like a dream,

1060
01:01:04,219 --> 01:01:06,011
we have to wake up somehow.

1061
01:01:07,053 --> 01:01:08,178
At least not now.

1062
01:01:13,178 --> 01:01:15,011
I don't want to get hurt again.

1063
01:01:15,219 --> 01:01:17,094
You won't, I promise.

1064
01:01:36,595 --> 01:01:37,589
You're here early.

1065
01:01:38,136 --> 01:01:40,344
You're early, too.
Don't you have work?

1066
01:01:44,053 --> 01:01:47,094
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

1067
01:01:48,428 --> 01:01:50,428
Nothing? Tell me.

1068
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:54,837
Mrs Lui.

1069
01:01:56,094 --> 01:01:58,386
We can't hide it from Eva anymore.

1070
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:05,171
- What's wrong, mom?
- I'm fine.

1071
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:07,843
- Tell me.
- It's nothing, really.

1072
01:02:09,261 --> 01:02:10,255
Adam.

1073
01:02:17,094 --> 01:02:21,219
We didn't tell you
because we didn't want you to worry,

1074
01:02:22,053 --> 01:02:23,636
but the doctor have just came by...

1075
01:02:26,261 --> 01:02:27,969
He confirmed that Mrs Lui has...

1076
01:02:29,219 --> 01:02:30,213
Brain cancer.

1077
01:02:38,969 --> 01:02:40,219
Can it be cured?

1078
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:44,046
Whether it can be cured or not
and how, it doesn't matter now.

1079
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,004
Everyone dies eventually, right?

1080
01:02:46,094 --> 01:02:48,136
You can't say that!

1081
01:02:49,053 --> 01:02:52,380
I'm your daughter,
how could you hide it from me?

1082
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:55,046
You should've told me.

1083
01:02:55,136 --> 01:02:57,296
It breaks my heart when you cry,

1084
01:02:57,386 --> 01:02:58,803
so don't cry.

1085
01:03:00,595 --> 01:03:01,589
Alright.

1086
01:03:04,094 --> 01:03:06,511
- It's alright...
- How could you do that?

1087
01:03:06,636 --> 01:03:08,762
I'm fine, it'll be okay.

1088
01:03:24,303 --> 01:03:27,303
Don't be like this, it doesn't help
to be worried like this.

1089
01:03:36,094 --> 01:03:40,178
I just want my mom
to live a happy life,

1090
01:03:42,094 --> 01:03:44,470
but now she's running out of time.

1091
01:03:45,386 --> 01:03:47,672
I don't know what to do,

1092
01:03:47,762 --> 01:03:50,094
my mind's a total blank.

1093
01:03:54,094 --> 01:03:55,803
I'll go through this with you.

1094
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:00,672
Take a leave of absence
from the firm,

1095
01:04:00,762 --> 01:04:02,969
so that you can spend some time
with your mom.

1096
01:04:13,011 --> 01:04:15,678
When my mom had cancer back then,
I met some brilliant doctors.

1097
01:04:16,136 --> 01:04:17,386
I'll contact them for you.

1098
01:04:23,011 --> 01:04:26,094
All these years,
your mom treated me like a son.

1099
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:27,969
I'll do all I can for her.

1100
01:04:36,844 --> 01:04:37,969
Thank you.

1101
01:04:47,843 --> 01:04:49,163
Do you want me to go up with you?

1102
01:04:51,678 --> 01:04:54,004
By the way,
this is some stomach medicine.

1103
01:04:54,094 --> 01:04:56,844
Recommended by my doctor friend,
try it.

1104
01:05:16,011 --> 01:05:16,963
"Incoming call, Eva Lui"

1105
01:05:17,053 --> 01:05:20,053
- Hello?
- Hey, Eva, how's it going?

1106
01:05:21,927 --> 01:05:25,011
- Everything's okay.
- I just hope you're okay.

1107
01:05:30,136 --> 01:05:31,130
Marvel.

1108
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,678
- Let's forget all these.
- Why?

1109
01:05:38,053 --> 01:05:39,178
I'm here for you.

1110
01:05:39,927 --> 01:05:43,094
I'm sorry, bye.

1111
01:05:44,969 --> 01:05:45,963
Eva?

1112
01:05:54,511 --> 01:05:57,672
"Incoming call, Ginny"

1113
01:05:57,762 --> 01:05:59,296
Marvel, good news.

1114
01:05:59,386 --> 01:06:02,553
The studio approved
the happy ending you proposed.

1115
01:06:03,303 --> 01:06:05,171
Oh, I see.

1116
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:06,428
Thanks, Ginny.

1117
01:06:34,886 --> 01:06:36,428
Nurse!

1118
01:06:36,762 --> 01:06:37,756
Where's Lin?

1119
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:39,421
Which Lin, sir?

1120
01:06:39,511 --> 01:06:42,837
The one who was at this bed before,
is she okay?

1121
01:06:42,927 --> 01:06:44,753
- I'm not sure.
- She came in for a dizzy spell.

1122
01:06:44,843 --> 01:06:46,588
Please, tell me where she's gone.

1123
01:06:46,678 --> 01:06:47,837
I'll help you find out.

1124
01:06:47,927 --> 01:06:49,470
I bought her an ice cream cone.

1125
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:50,754
Please.

1126
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:52,046
- I'll check for you.
- Is she okay?

1127
01:06:52,136 --> 01:06:55,011
"Saint Teresa's Hospital"

1128
01:06:56,011 --> 01:06:57,969
I told you to stop crying,

1129
01:06:58,344 --> 01:06:59,546
You're so pretty when you smile.

1130
01:06:59,636 --> 01:07:00,844
So smile for me, will you?

1131
01:07:13,927 --> 01:07:17,380
"Po-wah"

1132
01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:19,553
"27 missed calls from Po-wah"

1133
01:07:24,428 --> 01:07:25,713
Oh, the poor thing.

1134
01:07:25,803 --> 01:07:26,843
It can't get that off.

1135
01:07:27,053 --> 01:07:28,762
And it can't even walk now!

1136
01:07:29,303 --> 01:07:31,511
It's just too stupid
to be cute, right?

1137
01:07:32,553 --> 01:07:34,505
"Po-wah"

1138
01:07:34,595 --> 01:07:36,921
"I'm worried about you,
you won't answer..."

1139
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,261
"Do you want to delete your
conversation with Po-wah?"

1140
01:07:42,386 --> 01:07:43,386
"Delete"

1141
01:07:44,886 --> 01:07:47,296
All my life,

1142
01:07:47,386 --> 01:07:50,421
I've only done
whatever people want me to do.

1143
01:07:50,511 --> 01:07:54,636
Can I finally
call the shots this time?

1144
01:07:58,762 --> 01:08:03,094
I don't want to keep
switching hospitals,

1145
01:08:04,053 --> 01:08:08,261
nor keep switching doctors anymore.

1146
01:08:10,178 --> 01:08:11,261
I'm in pain.

1147
01:08:13,011 --> 01:08:14,303
This is torture.

1148
01:08:37,303 --> 01:08:38,297
Eva.

1149
01:08:42,636 --> 01:08:44,762
- This is for you.
- Really?

1150
01:08:47,303 --> 01:08:48,470
This is beautiful.

1151
01:08:51,094 --> 01:08:52,672
It'll take forever
to fold all of these.

1152
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:53,630
"He broke his leg,
he needs a cast..."

1153
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,630
It's not that many,
just 3,000 of them.

1154
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:59,011
- 3,000?
- We'll fold it together.

1155
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,803
You can even write on them.

1156
01:09:03,844 --> 01:09:05,844
Let me see what you wrote.

1157
01:09:06,219 --> 01:09:11,171
"I felt a shock the first time
we held hands, as the legends say!"

1158
01:09:11,261 --> 01:09:14,505
"On our first trip,
he forgot his passport!"

1159
01:09:14,595 --> 01:09:17,713
"He got his driver's license
for the first time!"

1160
01:09:17,803 --> 01:09:19,428
Say, did you receive
my text message?

1161
01:09:19,762 --> 01:09:20,762
What message?

1162
01:09:26,844 --> 01:09:29,927
I don't know what I can do to
make you forgive me the 78th time,

1163
01:09:31,803 --> 01:09:34,344
but if you do give me
one more chance,

1164
01:09:35,762 --> 01:09:37,219
I won't let you down.

1165
01:09:44,843 --> 01:09:46,203
I have the same dream every night,

1166
01:09:46,886 --> 01:09:50,261
that my daughter
would have a romantic wedding.

1167
01:09:54,803 --> 01:09:57,011
Will you make
that dream come true for me?

1168
01:10:00,678 --> 01:10:02,380
Go ahead and have another dream.

1169
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:03,963
- Come on, hurry up!
- You naughty girl!

1170
01:10:04,053 --> 01:10:05,493
- Alright, go have your dream.
- Hey!

1171
01:10:08,886 --> 01:10:11,672
- Are you okay?
- Can you give me a hand?

1172
01:10:11,762 --> 01:10:12,803
I'm coming in, then.

1173
01:10:26,969 --> 01:10:27,963
It's gorgeous.

1174
01:10:31,886 --> 01:10:32,880
Adam.

1175
01:10:34,178 --> 01:10:37,261
Did you know that one out of
five marriages end in divorce?

1176
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,219
My parents are one of them.

1177
01:10:44,011 --> 01:10:46,004
I don't mean to force you,

1178
01:10:46,094 --> 01:10:47,213
I don't want you to do this
because my mom...

1179
01:10:47,303 --> 01:10:48,969
I want to do this.

1180
01:10:52,219 --> 01:10:54,129
After our breakup,

1181
01:10:54,219 --> 01:10:57,254
I thought that maybe

1182
01:10:57,344 --> 01:11:01,004
I had too many impractical fantasies
and expectations for you.

1183
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:02,296
Maybe I read too many fairy tales

1184
01:11:02,386 --> 01:11:04,470
with princes and princesses,

1185
01:11:06,843 --> 01:11:08,927
maybe I should be more like
the people around me.

1186
01:11:09,803 --> 01:11:13,094
As well as lower my expectations,
so that I wouldn't be disappointed.

1187
01:11:13,678 --> 01:11:14,843
You don't have to do that.

1188
01:11:16,386 --> 01:11:19,762
If you feel uncomfortable
after the wedding,

1189
01:11:21,386 --> 01:11:22,844
you can choose all over again.

1190
01:11:24,803 --> 01:11:27,178
Fulfilling your mom's wish
is the most important thing now.

1191
01:11:36,094 --> 01:11:37,796
Okay, look at this way.

1192
01:11:37,886 --> 01:11:40,511
Look at each other now, good.

1193
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:43,171
Another one.

1194
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:45,886
One, two, three.

1195
01:11:55,886 --> 01:11:57,178
One, two, three.

1196
01:12:00,011 --> 01:12:01,386
Too many red balloons!

1197
01:12:03,136 --> 01:12:04,261
One, two and swing!

1198
01:12:24,843 --> 01:12:26,136
Isn't it adorable?

1199
01:12:26,969 --> 01:12:29,303
- You two look great together!
- Look at this.

1200
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,261
You're really great together!

1201
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:33,553
The perfect match!

1202
01:12:37,803 --> 01:12:39,969
Honey, that's a beautiful dress!

1203
01:12:41,969 --> 01:12:43,428
Doesn't my daughter look pretty?

1204
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:46,421
"Eva and Adam's Wedding"

1205
01:12:46,511 --> 01:12:54,254
"Marriage is between two people,"

1206
01:12:54,344 --> 01:13:01,380
"but a wedding involves
the whole world."

1207
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:09,254
The bridal car's okay,
fast and furious!

1208
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:13,963
"Flower shop is okay."

1209
01:13:14,053 --> 01:13:16,546
"Make-up is okay."

1210
01:13:16,636 --> 01:13:24,753
"The wedding venue is set."

1211
01:13:24,843 --> 01:13:28,136
Please give me a job, period.

1212
01:13:29,178 --> 01:13:31,511
Except for arranging seating.

1213
01:13:32,844 --> 01:13:36,296
"How's this backdrop?"

1214
01:13:36,386 --> 01:13:39,843
"Discount from my friend,"

1215
01:13:40,219 --> 01:13:43,588
"35 percent off."

1216
01:13:43,678 --> 01:13:46,630
I say again, period.

1217
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:50,720
Don't force me to wear that
bridesmaid dress, exclamation mark.

1218
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:58,844
"Love you all."

1219
01:14:07,303 --> 01:14:08,297
Excuse me.

1220
01:14:14,969 --> 01:14:16,927
I'm flying
out on working holiday tomorrow.

1221
01:14:17,178 --> 01:14:19,886
Come out for a drink
with me tonight, send me off.

1222
01:14:21,136 --> 01:14:22,595
I'm getting married in a few days.

1223
01:14:26,927 --> 01:14:27,921
Oh, to Eva?

1224
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,714
Yeah.

1225
01:14:31,428 --> 01:14:32,948
You've got better taste
than her, then.

1226
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:36,464
Anyway,

1227
01:14:38,094 --> 01:14:40,088
thanks for sending the link

1228
01:14:40,178 --> 01:14:41,470
of that "77 Heartwarmings".

1229
01:14:43,094 --> 01:14:45,678
I didn't do it, why would I do that?

1230
01:14:46,927 --> 01:14:47,969
It wasn't you?

1231
01:14:48,844 --> 01:14:50,344
Have a good marriage.

1232
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,762
If you get divorced, call me.

1233
01:15:32,011 --> 01:15:33,011
Here you are.

1234
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:37,844
- Your fan letters.
- Thanks.

1235
01:15:40,011 --> 01:15:41,178
It's so cute.

1236
01:15:41,386 --> 01:15:43,843
- Drink mine.
- Thank you.

1237
01:15:47,094 --> 01:15:48,636
Back here for filming?

1238
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:52,053
I hope it's not for
another Space-time Intrusion.

1239
01:15:52,261 --> 01:15:53,511
I came back for you.

1240
01:15:56,511 --> 01:16:00,386
Marvel, my wedding
is in a couple of days.

1241
01:16:01,011 --> 01:16:02,136
So...

1242
01:16:03,844 --> 01:16:06,386
You decided to give the audience
a happy ending?

1243
01:16:07,011 --> 01:16:08,386
As you said,

1244
01:16:08,678 --> 01:16:10,296
life is about breaking the rules

1245
01:16:10,386 --> 01:16:12,219
to find who you really are.

1246
01:16:14,178 --> 01:16:16,921
Which means life and love
are conflicting.

1247
01:16:17,011 --> 01:16:19,011
Every movie has an ending.

1248
01:16:19,261 --> 01:16:20,837
But why does it end here?

1249
01:16:20,927 --> 01:16:22,470
The audiences.

1250
01:16:25,219 --> 01:16:26,886
The wedding's not only for me.

1251
01:16:28,344 --> 01:16:30,053
Your case is closed.

1252
01:16:33,678 --> 01:16:34,886
If I were you,

1253
01:16:36,303 --> 01:16:37,886
I would change the ending.

1254
01:16:39,969 --> 01:16:41,886
But I'm just a simple girl,

1255
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:46,178
not a Space-time Intruder.

1256
01:17:19,511 --> 01:17:20,511
Thank you.

1257
01:17:22,843 --> 01:17:24,428
Mrs Lui, wait here.

1258
01:17:50,844 --> 01:17:52,178
You look beautiful today.

1259
01:17:53,762 --> 01:17:54,921
What are they doing?

1260
01:17:55,011 --> 01:17:57,636
Adam and I have a surprise for you.

1261
01:18:07,886 --> 01:18:10,843
That's your mother.

1262
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,678
Look at this one,
she is so beautiful!

1263
01:18:31,053 --> 01:18:32,053
This is for you.

1264
01:18:34,011 --> 01:18:35,005
Thank you.

1265
01:18:38,344 --> 01:18:40,428
We've lost a lot of time.

1266
01:18:40,553 --> 01:18:41,380
Therefore, today,

1267
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:43,338
in front of
your daughter and Adam...

1268
01:18:43,428 --> 01:18:44,843
I'd like to ask...

1269
01:18:46,803 --> 01:18:48,136
Will you marry me?

1270
01:18:58,053 --> 01:18:59,303
I do.

1271
01:19:14,136 --> 01:19:16,886
I've picked a dress for you, Mom.

1272
01:19:33,011 --> 01:19:34,005
Look.

1273
01:19:37,344 --> 01:19:42,219
This dress looks like
the wedding dress in my dream.

1274
01:19:44,969 --> 01:19:46,803
You'll look beautiful in it.

1275
01:19:49,803 --> 01:19:50,927
Thank you.

1276
01:19:54,678 --> 01:19:56,421
Thank you all for attending...

1277
01:19:56,511 --> 01:19:58,837
Wait, don't get married!

1278
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:00,254
Stop the execution!

1279
01:20:00,344 --> 01:20:01,338
You again?

1280
01:20:03,344 --> 01:20:04,428
Don't mess things up here.

1281
01:20:04,886 --> 01:20:06,754
- You look familiar.
- Last time...

1282
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:10,386
I'm not getting married,
so just sit down and be the VIP!

1283
01:20:11,927 --> 01:20:13,678
Eva's mother is getting married.

1284
01:20:14,053 --> 01:20:15,933
- Have a seat.
- Congratulations, Mother-in-law.

1285
01:20:17,178 --> 01:20:18,172
What mother-in-law?

1286
01:20:19,011 --> 01:20:19,886
Not true!

1287
01:20:20,094 --> 01:20:21,886
Let's start.

1288
01:20:22,511 --> 01:20:24,546
Thank you for attending

1289
01:20:24,636 --> 01:20:27,511
Mei-lin and Po-wah's wedding today.

1290
01:20:33,969 --> 01:20:36,803
This is Lin,
she doesn't have many hobbies.

1291
01:20:36,927 --> 01:20:40,219
Her only hobby
is taking care of her daughter,

1292
01:20:40,886 --> 01:20:43,803
but she's never asked her daughter
to take care of her.

1293
01:20:44,511 --> 01:20:47,296
Women in her generation
never asked for much.

1294
01:20:47,386 --> 01:20:51,588
As long as their families stay
together and stay happy,

1295
01:20:51,678 --> 01:20:53,386
they'll feel content.

1296
01:20:53,969 --> 01:20:56,713
All these years,
Lin's responsibilities

1297
01:20:56,803 --> 01:20:59,470
outweighed her own happiness.

1298
01:20:59,969 --> 01:21:02,386
Lin didn't ask for this,

1299
01:21:03,261 --> 01:21:06,969
but as your daughter
and your wedding's witness,

1300
01:21:07,511 --> 01:21:09,636
I hope that
for the rest of her days,

1301
01:21:10,844 --> 01:21:14,511
she'll find the happiness
that she deserves.

1302
01:21:19,511 --> 01:21:20,803
Tsang Po-wah.

1303
01:21:22,636 --> 01:21:23,753
Do you agree

1304
01:21:23,843 --> 01:21:27,296
to be Chau Mei-lin's husband
and make her happy?

1305
01:21:27,386 --> 01:21:28,470
I do.

1306
01:21:30,428 --> 01:21:31,553
Chau Mei-lin.

1307
01:21:32,094 --> 01:21:33,470
Do you agree

1308
01:21:34,053 --> 01:21:38,844
to be Tsang Po-wah's wife
and make him happy?

1309
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,720
I do.

1310
01:21:44,636 --> 01:21:46,599
Please exchange wedding rings.

1311
01:21:57,636 --> 01:22:01,094
I hereby pronounce you
husband and wife.

1312
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,713
Enjoy your life,
don't worry about me.

1313
01:22:14,803 --> 01:22:17,136
You have to enjoy your life, too.

1314
01:22:17,762 --> 01:22:18,844
My mom's in your hands now.

1315
01:22:19,344 --> 01:22:20,796
Sure, don't worry.

1316
01:22:20,886 --> 01:22:22,053
Be good to my daughter.

1317
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,678
I will, don't worry!

1318
01:22:23,803 --> 01:22:24,753
- It is none of your business.
- Hey, boss...

1319
01:22:24,843 --> 01:22:26,563
- I'll sponsor your honeymoon!
- What is it?

1320
01:22:35,636 --> 01:22:38,178
I've never seen my mom
had a smile that sweet.

1321
01:22:38,927 --> 01:22:41,004
No matter how old a woman is,

1322
01:22:41,094 --> 01:22:43,338
there's a young girl living inside.

1323
01:22:43,428 --> 01:22:45,511
Stephen Hawking once said that

1324
01:22:45,636 --> 01:22:48,011
even he can't fathom woman.

1325
01:22:49,886 --> 01:22:51,463
Are we that hard to understand?

1326
01:22:51,553 --> 01:22:55,011
You sure are,
but I'll try my best to learn.

1327
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,178
Let me show you something.

1328
01:23:04,803 --> 01:23:06,303
You still have this thing?

1329
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:08,004
What "thing"?

1330
01:23:08,094 --> 01:23:10,636
This jar is called
"The Stars from you".

1331
01:23:11,803 --> 01:23:12,713
Who knows how long ago,

1332
01:23:12,803 --> 01:23:14,588
I put the jar away

1333
01:23:14,678 --> 01:23:16,386
and stopped folding the stars.

1334
01:23:17,386 --> 01:23:20,803
Since then, I stopped
remembering the good things.

1335
01:23:21,428 --> 01:23:24,927
It's true, people seem to
always remember the bad things.

1336
01:23:29,344 --> 01:23:30,927
You should keep it from now on then.

1337
01:23:32,053 --> 01:23:33,753
Take out a star once in a while,

1338
01:23:33,843 --> 01:23:36,303
then open it up
and remind me of the good things.

1339
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:38,963
Sure.

1340
01:23:44,595 --> 01:23:46,843
Did you send this app to remind me?

1341
01:23:50,053 --> 01:23:52,013
Didn't you send this
to remind me to win you back?

1342
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:54,505
"Anon"

1343
01:23:54,595 --> 01:23:55,470
Anon?

1344
01:23:55,595 --> 01:23:56,505
Who is it?

1345
01:23:56,595 --> 01:23:57,421
It's confidential.

1346
01:23:57,511 --> 01:23:59,588
I think you should
get back with that Adam guy.

1347
01:23:59,678 --> 01:24:01,762
You checked my messages?

1348
01:24:06,428 --> 01:24:09,129
"Type a message"

1349
01:24:09,219 --> 01:24:10,844
"77 Heartwarmings"

1350
01:24:12,303 --> 01:24:14,094
"Message from Anon"

1351
01:24:17,344 --> 01:24:21,261
"77 Heartwarmings"

1352
01:24:35,011 --> 01:24:36,963
What is the app telling you to do?

1353
01:24:37,053 --> 01:24:38,296
"Move of the Day"

1354
01:24:38,386 --> 01:24:39,754
"Invite her to do something
she has never done before"

1355
01:24:39,844 --> 01:24:43,094
Invite her to do something
she has never done before.

1356
01:24:44,344 --> 01:24:46,344
What haven't I done before?

1357
01:25:07,428 --> 01:25:09,136
You teach kickboxing here?

1358
01:25:10,803 --> 01:25:12,219
Yeah, come on in.

1359
01:25:46,803 --> 01:25:48,338
I keep forgetting to ask you.

1360
01:25:48,428 --> 01:25:50,837
For that blizzard question
at the interview,

1361
01:25:50,927 --> 01:25:52,178
what was the answer you gave?

1362
01:25:52,843 --> 01:25:54,094
My answer was...

1363
01:25:55,344 --> 01:25:58,595
Giving the car key
to my best friend,

1364
01:25:59,136 --> 01:26:01,004
so that he can drive the old lady
to the hospital.

1365
01:26:01,094 --> 01:26:03,344
Meanwhile,
I can stay at the bus stop

1366
01:26:03,678 --> 01:26:06,011
and wait for the bus
with the dream girl.

1367
01:26:13,053 --> 01:26:16,261
Love is an instinct,
but it takes some learning, too.

1368
01:26:17,303 --> 01:26:18,796
You're into gaming now?

1369
01:26:18,886 --> 01:26:20,762
And you're reading
psychology books too?

1370
01:26:24,843 --> 01:26:26,094
Faster...

1371
01:26:26,261 --> 01:26:27,338
One, two!

1373
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:29,470
"Backers by Adobe"

1374
01:26:35,844 --> 01:26:36,762
Let's start.

1375
01:26:36,886 --> 01:26:37,880
Here.

1376
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:47,464
Come on.

1377
01:26:53,261 --> 01:26:54,428
Just go easy.

1378
01:26:57,886 --> 01:26:58,927
There's something in here.

1379
01:27:14,511 --> 01:27:16,219
Did the app tell you
to do this, too?

1380
01:27:18,303 --> 01:27:19,762
No, I told the app to do this.

1381
01:27:25,344 --> 01:27:26,171
"Move of the day"

1382
01:27:26,261 --> 01:27:30,004
"Eva, will you spend your life
together with me?"

1383
01:27:30,094 --> 01:27:33,261
Adam, we have every confidence
in your creativity and leadership.

1384
01:27:33,803 --> 01:27:36,254
This "77 Heartwarmings" app
that you created

1385
01:27:36,344 --> 01:27:38,094
has been greenlit by our company.

1386
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:40,171
Whoever you want to hire for this,

1387
01:27:40,261 --> 01:27:41,843
we have your back.

1388
01:27:43,553 --> 01:27:46,595
Each of your answers has
its own set of reasoning behind it.

1389
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:47,803
In my case,

1390
01:27:48,053 --> 01:27:51,219
there's someone very special
who changed my life.

1391
01:27:51,678 --> 01:27:52,796
She taught me

1392
01:27:52,886 --> 01:27:55,843
how to be more caring
and understanding.

1393
01:27:56,428 --> 01:27:57,948
She made me
a better version of myself.

5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

1397
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:12,505
The app's published!

1398
01:28:12,595 --> 01:28:13,589
Yes!

1399
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:16,713
- Congratulations, Adam!
- Thank you, guys.

1400
01:28:16,803 --> 01:28:17,796
We've worked so hard on this!

1401
01:28:17,886 --> 01:28:19,380
This app is going to be a hit!

"Heartwarmings Exam Preparation"

1403
01:28:21,969 --> 01:28:23,803
I really want us
to be together again.

1404
01:28:24,178 --> 01:28:25,046
But that's not

1405
01:28:25,136 --> 01:28:26,969
the only reason I developed the app.

1406
01:28:28,011 --> 01:28:29,754
I want those people
who bury their heads in their phones

1407
01:28:29,844 --> 01:28:31,803
to look up
at the people beside them.

1408
01:28:37,969 --> 01:28:39,470
"77 Heartwarmings",

1409
01:28:39,969 --> 01:28:41,844
I developed it
to remind people how to...

1410
01:28:45,303 --> 01:28:46,344
Love.

1411
01:29:18,386 --> 01:29:19,553
Eva Lui.

1412
01:29:20,136 --> 01:29:22,886
This guy may have moved you
77 times,

1413
01:29:23,094 --> 01:29:25,843
but he hurt you
77 times before, too.

1414
01:29:26,178 --> 01:29:28,762
Is this the so-called
happy ending you want?

1415
01:29:35,762 --> 01:29:37,511
Can I have a little more time?

1416
01:29:41,303 --> 01:29:42,428
We've got plenty of time.

1417
01:29:49,094 --> 01:29:51,636
"Will you kiss me?"

1418
01:29:52,886 --> 01:29:55,511
"Will you hug me?"

1419
01:29:56,344 --> 01:30:02,011
"What if I never know the answers?"

1420
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,595
"Will you need me?"

1421
01:30:07,053 --> 01:30:10,053
"Will you love me?"

1422
01:30:11,011 --> 01:30:13,505
"Have we the chance to be together?"

1423
01:30:13,595 --> 01:30:15,636
Eva, look.

1424
01:30:17,636 --> 01:30:19,844
"Cherish my heart"

1425
01:30:21,428 --> 01:30:27,254
"You're the sunshine
of my most gloomy life"

1426
01:30:27,344 --> 01:30:30,344
"The only bright light"

1427
01:30:31,428 --> 01:30:33,553
"Perish my soul"

1428
01:30:35,053 --> 01:30:37,595
"When you're away"

1429
01:30:38,843 --> 01:30:41,470
"When you're gone out,"

1430
01:30:41,844 --> 01:30:43,762
"out of sight"
