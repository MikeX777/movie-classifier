1
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,362
Oh Tanya, thank you.

2
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,241
Have a nice summer, honey.

3
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,408
Bye, darling.

4
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:08,671
<i>_ Hey-</i>

5
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:10,172
This is for you traveler.

6
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:11,340
Oh, thank you.

7
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:12,800
What is it?

8
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,011
Oh, you shouldn't have.

9
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:16,762
- Well I thought this
would be just the thing

10
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,722
to take to the boonies.

11
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,641
You're probably right.

12
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:22,560
- Why are you going
to a hick town

13
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,895
where you don't know
a soul for anyhow?

14
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:25,813
Oh, I don't know.

15
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:27,439
To be alone for a little while.

16
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,649
- Do you really think this
is the right time to go?

17
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:31,402
I mean are you
feeling strong enough?

18
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,695
I feel fine, Lois, really.

19
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:33,737
Fine.

20
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,114
Yeah, but your mom just died

21
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,574
and it's only been a few
months since your divorce.

22
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,367
You know what?

23
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:39,618
You sound a lot like my shrink.

24
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,120
He doesn't give me
any support either.

25
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,748
- Well, George and I
would love to have you

26
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,667
come to the beach.

27
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,043
A lot of great guys out there.

28
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,378
Let's give me a break.

29
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:50,629
That's not what
I need right now.

30
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,174
Well, no harm in trying.

31
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:54,925
Oh, I appreciate the offer

32
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:56,427
but I think I'd really
like to spend the summer

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,721
in the old family house.

34
00:02:59,054 --> 00:02:59,847
- Alright, I don't
want to be a pain.

35
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:01,724
But if you get lonely
or shakey or anything,

36
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,350
you give me a call, okay?

37
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,685
I promise.

38
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:05,895
I'm going to leave
tomorrow afternoon

39
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,646
and as soon as I get the
phone in, I'll call you.

40
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,689
<i>_ okay-</i>

41
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,774
Oh, I'm going to miss you.

42
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:11,650
Me too.

43
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,428
- Why are
you so against this?

44
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,805
I'm taking a vacation
in the country.

45
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:05,848
The air is fresh.

46
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,433
The people are friendly

47
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,645
and no one knows anything
about this last year.

48
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,814
- What will you do
if they find out?

49
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:16,525
- I'll just tell them
the truth, flat out.

50
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,777
Jane Hardy was on the edge.

51
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,237
And she came back.

52
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,576
Now what's so
terrible about that?

53
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,747
All I know is that I
don't like the pain.

54
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,541
And I want to get away from it.

55
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,084
And away from here.

56
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,838
- Well symbols of
the pain will be here

57
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,757
when you get back, won't they?

58
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,717
I don't know that.

59
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,469
I haven't yet given
myself a chance

60
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,180
to get away from
them to find out.

61
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,556
What if it doesn't work out?

62
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,850
I'll try something else.

63
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,348
Hello, Mr. Pritchard?

64
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:54,808
Thank goodness.

65
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,643
This is Jane Hardy.

66
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,896
I wrote you about
my aunt's house?

67
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,230
I know it's late.

68
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,066
But you could please come
down here and give me the keys

69
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,569
so I can get into the house?

70
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,990
Well, I'm a little tired
too, Mr. Pritchard.

71
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,576
I've had an awfully long drive.

72
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,497
I'm at the Ramona Court...

73
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,796
Uh, will it take you very long
to get here, Mr. Pritchard?

74
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,050
No, no, no, no one's
trying to rush you.

75
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,801
Okay, okay.

76
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,929
I'll just be waiting for you.

77
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,264
I'm in a red Chevrolet.

78
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,393
Good...bye.

79
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,572
Jane Hardy?

80
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,823
Yes.

81
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,908
I'm Walter Pritchard.

82
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:35,784
Follow me.

83
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:06,565
- I really appreciate
you getting up

84
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:07,983
and letting me in.

85
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,526
Well, you should.

86
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,571
11 o'clock at night, decent
people ought to be in bed.

87
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:13,447
Come on.

88
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:18,410
Well, what the hell's
the matter now?

89
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:19,911
I don't know.

90
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,121
Just a chill.

91
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,099
There.

92
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,686
Oh what the hell,
I told those...

93
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,692
Ha, just as I promised you.

94
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,694
Exactly the way it was

95
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:57,240
when your aunt died
30 some odd years ago.

96
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,871
Your mother hardly
ever set foot in here.

97
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,083
It really ought to be mine.

98
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,126
What do you mean?

99
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,045
- Well your mother
promised it to me.

100
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,964
Probate, legal fees, and a swift

101
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,511
for generally looking
after the old place

102
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,222
for thirty some odd years.

103
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,515
Well I never heard that.

104
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,433
- Well, you probably
wouldn't admit it if you had.

105
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,143
Here are the keys.

106
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,021
You'll have to drop into
my office in a couple days

107
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,523
and sign some papers.

108
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,068
That is if you
decide to stay here.

109
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,987
Personally, I think
you're crazy for wanting

110
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,031
to live in this old place.

111
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,117
<i>I'll be by.</i>

112
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,120
Yeah, for sure.

113
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,330
Goodnight, Mr. Pritchard.

114
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,250
And thanks a lot.

115
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,169
Huh...

116
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,172
Hey, lady-

117
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:23,423
You want a lift?

118
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,953
Not too bad.

119
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,248
Not too bad at all for the
first time in 10 months.

120
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,504
Oh!

121
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,464
Telephone company, lady.

122
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,884
Good, I'm glad to see you.

123
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,970
- Yeah, Mr. Pritchard,
he called yesterday.

124
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,263
Oh, come on in.

125
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,724
I'd have thought if
he called yesterday,

126
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,144
it would have taken
you months to get here.

127
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,355
Oh you don't happen to have

128
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:24,651
one of those pretty powder
blue princess models, no?

129
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,476
Okay, here you go.

130
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,769
Thank you.

131
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,312
Anything else?

132
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,189
- Yes, could you recommend
someone around here

133
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,275
who can help me
with some handiwork?

134
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:06,401
Fixing some windows,
patching a roof,

135
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,070
some things like that.

136
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,613
Well I don't know.

137
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,533
- Well how about
Bo Rehnquist, dad?

138
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,618
We don't know anybody.

139
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,413
- This Rehnquist
fellow, is he nearby?

140
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,665
- Yeah, about a
mile up the road.

141
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,709
He's got a big red house.

142
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,252
That's $27.54.

143
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,128
Cash.

144
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,548
You're kidding?

145
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,175
Cash.

146
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,511
- I don't have
that much with me.

147
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:34,637
Could you send it out?

148
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,181
I'm right out on County Road.

149
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,348
Where?

150
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,267
The old Martin place.

151
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,810
I'm Jane Hardy.

152
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,771
My aunt Rebecca
used to live there.

153
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,606
We don't deliver that far.

154
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,609
It's just down the road.

155
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,486
Dad, I can do it tomorrow.

156
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,946
I got to down to the
Baker's house anyway.

157
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,617
My son will bring it out.

158
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:56,951
Just this once.

159
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,247
- Is everyone is Blackford
as friendly as you are?

160
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,499
We're busy, Miss Hardy.

161
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:03,625
Sure.

162
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:09,672
Hey, dad.

163
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,174
What was that all about?

164
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,967
It doesn't concern you.

165
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,303
Don't you have work to do?

166
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:16,471
Yeah, sure.

167
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:29,734
<i>Need any he), m' am'?</i>

168
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,319
No, thank you.

169
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,612
I can handle it myself.

170
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,615
- Yeah, I can see
that from here.

171
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:40,995
<i>I'm Jack Demon.</i>

172
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,665
I'm sheriff around here.

173
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:44,666
The old Martin place, right?

174
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,085
Yes, I'm Jane Hardy.

175
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,963
- Well Jane, welcome
to Blackford.

176
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,300
You plan on staying very long?

177
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,554
Well I'm not exactly sure yet.

178
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,556
Maybe for the summer.

179
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,518
- Oh, the rest of
the summer, huh?

180
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:04,602
That's nice.

181
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,440
Hey, I saw you jogging down
County Road this morning.

182
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,442
I'm not one to
forget a pretty face,

183
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,862
if you know what I mean.

184
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,698
- I think I know
exactly what you mean.

185
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:18,408
Good bye, sheriff.

186
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,927
Are you Mr. Rehnquist?

187
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,054
I'm Rehnquist, Bo Rehnquist.

188
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:44,225
- My house needs to have some
general repairs done to it.

189
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,311
And they told me down at
Gordon's hardware store

190
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,564
that you might be
interested in doing it.

191
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:51,649
Sounds okay so far.

192
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,152
You live by yourself in a house?

193
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,487
Yes.

194
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,700
Look, I live out on County Road.

195
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,702
The big old house off the road?

196
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,704
Would you start tomorrow?

197
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,124
- I don't know any big
old houses on County Road.

198
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,500
Yeah, it's the Martin place.

199
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,632
I'll be busy tomorrow.

200
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:17,634
What's wrong?

201
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,427
I... I'll be busy.

202
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,471
- But you did say that
you could do the job.

203
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,766
- Tomorrow, next
week... I'm too busy.

204
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,615
- As you are
washed in the blood

205
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:43,993
of the land, then you will
dwell in the house of the Lord.

206
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:49,457
Just waiting for the chance.

207
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,833
Yes the Lord...

208
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,923
Will carry you all the way
up to those pearly gates.

209
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,259
Nowhere is safe.

210
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,262
Nowhere you can
hide from the Devil.

211
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,976
Hey, you made it, didn't you?

212
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,019
- Yeah, I got the
stuff you ordered.

213
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:13,189
My dad told me to come
out here and collect.

214
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:14,482
In cash.

215
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:15,358
<i>_ okay-</i>

216
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,402
I'm Paul.

217
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:18,861
I'm Jane.

218
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,571
You're a lot friendlier
than your folks.

219
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,323
- Yeah, well they're
kind of weird.

220
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,826
- I think everyone
around here is weird.

221
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,869
- Did you get that
handyman you wanted?

222
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,746
Is the job still open?

223
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:30,957
Yeah, it's wide open.

224
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,875
That Rehnquist guy
didn't want it all.

225
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,294
He didn't want to
come out to the house.

226
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,296
I think he wanted me to
bring the house to him.

227
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,549
- Well, I'd kind of
like to come out here

228
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:40,425
and work.

229
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,803
Would you really?

230
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:45,847
Yeah, I can fix anything.

231
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,433
My dad says I'm a
natural born Mr. Fix-It.

232
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,018
Do you have experience?

233
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,894
- I didn't get these
from playing the piano.

234
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,856
You have callouses.

235
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,441
You're hired, Paul.

236
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,735
Alright, I'm so broke.

237
00:21:59,068 --> 00:21:59,694
I can't tell you.

238
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,321
I'm really broke.

239
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,697
- Well you're not going
to get rich working here.

240
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:03,823
When you can start?

241
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,284
- I've got some stuff
to do this afternoon.

242
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,452
How about tomorrow?

243
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:08,911
Tomorrow's fine.

244
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,415
Start with putting some screens
on the upstairs windows.

245
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:13,958
Check out the roof.

246
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:15,251
And we'll make out
a list of things

247
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:17,754
that we need for
your dad to fill.

248
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,464
What's the matter?

249
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,675
- I don't think my dad is
going to be too thrilled

250
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,469
about me hanging out here.

251
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:25,470
Really?

252
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:26,346
Why?

253
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:28,931
Come on, Paul.

254
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,016
Don't you think I
have a right to know

255
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,351
why everyone around Blackford

256
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,770
treats me like I
have the plague?

257
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:34,645
Well...

258
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,358
You don't have to tell me now.

259
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,776
Not until the roof is finished.

260
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:40,777
You're still hired.

261
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,736
Alright.

262
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,862
0K3)'-

263
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,239
See you tomorrow.

264
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,952
- Paul, aren't you
forgetting something?

265
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,454
What?

266
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,789
The money.

267
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:53,873
The money.

268
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,042
He'd kill me.

269
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,085
I swear to god.

270
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,086
He'd kill me.

271
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,087
Bash my face in.

272
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,505
Rip out my hair.

273
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,416
- Mr. Pritchard, would you
just lay it on the line.

274
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,376
Is the house mine or not?

275
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:39,877
My dear Miss Hardy,

276
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,838
of course you own it.

277
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:45,007
I'm talking here of probate,
finalizing the will,

278
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,342
your taking possession.

279
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,845
All of these things take time.

280
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,889
- Why the hell are
you stalling me?

281
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,976
- Now don't you be
insolent with me.

282
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,769
- The finalized
papers, Mr. Pritchard.

283
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,146
When will they be ready?

284
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,481
- They will be ready
when I get them.

285
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,358
This is not a big city you know.

286
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:04,527
In a few days, I suppose.

287
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,196
Fine.

288
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,033
- Oh, Miss Hardy, have you
met our sheriff, Jack Denton?

289
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:13,619
Yes, we've already met.

290
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:14,620
Well not really.

291
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,289
Just in passing.

292
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:17,915
You know, Miss Hardy,
on the way in I noticed

293
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,418
a fresh dent in
your fender there.

294
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,837
Have you been in an
accident recently?

295
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,088
You know you're
supposed to report

296
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:27,008
that sort of thing
to the police.

297
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,176
I backed into a tree.

298
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,555
Really, Miss Hardy?

299
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,307
Trees jumping from
behind every bush.

300
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,808
You never know what's
going to happen

301
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,768
around here these days.

302
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:40,480
I should have warned you.

303
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:44,692
You must be careful on all
these old back country roads.

304
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,987
- I'll see you in two
days, Mr. Pritchard.

305
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,451
You know, Jack.

306
00:24:53,826 --> 00:25:03,586
I have a feeling that girl is
not very long for this town.

307
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,088
Yeah, Walter.

308
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,383
I know exactly what you mean.

309
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,010
Miss Hardy, please.

310
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:19,221
- Oh, you scared
the hell out of me.

311
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,223
- I should probably take
that as a compliment.

312
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,100
Flaughs)

313
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:24,393
I'm Reverend Winston.

314
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,103
I'm the minister at
the Blackford Church.

315
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:27,772
Forgive me, please.

316
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,899
Come in to the living room.

317
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:31,275
I heard you on the radio
the other day, didn't I?

318
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:32,151
Yes.

319
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,072
You know we tape those shows
right here at the church.

320
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:39,325
Would you like to
come by one Sunday?

321
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,120
- Reverend, I haven't been to
church since I was a child.

322
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:46,248
- Well, church is the
tallest building in town.

323
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,086
So if you ever need
anything, stop on by.

324
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,962
Welcome to Blackford, Jane.

325
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,506
Thank you.

326
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,466
- How do you like
our town so far?

327
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,342
Well,

328
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:00,930
the people are not
exactly friendly.

329
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,808
But then I'm told it's
because of this house.

330
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,310
Why all the standoffishness?

331
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:10,106
Perhaps it's your imagination.

332
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,024
And you're new.

333
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:13,109
An outsider.

334
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:15,778
- Well, they're just going
to have to get used to me,

335
00:28:16,112 --> 00:28:16,862
aren't they?

336
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:30,960
- Maybe the country's not
the right place for you.

337
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:35,381
Got to be going, thanks.

338
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,222
A lovely woman.

339
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,810
You look a lot like her.

340
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:48,894
Thank you.

341
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:51,522
Goodnight, Jane.

342
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,190
Goodnight, reverend.

343
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:54,316
- Hope to see you
in church soon.

344
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,192
Perhaps.

345
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,655
Sunday, this is a wonderful day.

346
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:43,741
Louis and I have finally,

347
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:47,495
after two years, set
our wedding date.

348
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:48,579
October 3rd.

349
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,250
The following day Louis
will preach his first sermon

350
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:56,128
at the new church in Oak Blocks.

351
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:59,006
I'll miss Blackford
and this lovely house.

352
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,510
But Louis is a man any woman
would be proud to have.

353
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,846
And a minister's wife is called
upon to follow her husband.

354
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:05,447
Well, hello there.

355
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:06,448
What's your name?

356
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:07,449
Alice.

357
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,660
But my mommy told me
not to say hello to you.

358
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:11,829
- Now why would
she tell you that?

359
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,290
- Because you live
in the funny house.

360
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,959
I live in a funny house, do I?

361
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:20,462
What's so funny about my house?

362
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:23,340
- It's haunted and
you're a ghost.

363
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,184
Miss?

364
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,185
Are you alright?

365
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,438
Sullivan, Tom Sullivan.

366
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:43,522
- Are you
sure you didn't see

367
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:44,857
that big black car?

368
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,526
- No, but then I had
just turned onto County Road.

369
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,902
Oh, that light.

370
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,616
I'm positive I turned
it off before I left.

371
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,953
Would you mind walking
me to the door?

372
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,038
Certainly.

373
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,383
You really don't have to wait.

374
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:12,468
I want to.

375
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:19,641
- Make yourself comfortable
in the living room.

376
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:23,520
I'll go upstairs and
I'll be down in a minute.

377
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:50,589
It was nothing.

378
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:54,134
I guess the wiring's
just shot in this house.

379
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:55,928
That's a photograph of my aunt.

380
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,806
She was a beautiful woman.

381
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,432
You have her eyes.

382
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,352
Oh, do you think so?

383
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,438
Would you like
something to drink?

384
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,649
I have wine, tea, coffee.

385
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,693
No, thank you.

386
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,237
I've really got to go.

387
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,696
Well thank you for everything.

388
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,031
It's my pleasure.

389
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:18,033
I'll see to it that
your car gets back home.

390
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:19,034
Oh no, please don't bother.

391
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:20,035
I'll call a tow truck.

392
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:21,662
I insist.

393
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:25,958
Besides it'll give me an opportunity
to see you again, Jane.

394
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,836
- Alright, well I'm
certainly glad you showed up

395
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,045
when you did.

396
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,047
Good night.

397
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,615
September 19th.

398
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,618
A stranger came to
the house today.

399
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,495
His name is Robert.

400
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,622
He was very polite and
we sat on the porch

401
00:36:05,956 --> 00:36:07,207
and talked for hours.

402
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,334
He was very handsome
and anyone could see

403
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:11,587
he was well bred.

404
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,839
I'm a little ashamed that
I let him hold my hand.

405
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,466
But there seemed no harm in it.

406
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,821
I'm powerless to stop it.

407
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:40,699
There's something strange
and wonderful about him.

408
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,451
He brought me a gift.

409
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:47,623
A beautiful locket with
an unusual symbol on it.

410
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:55,172
September 21st, can it be true?

411
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,800
After two days, I
write these words

412
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:01,803
with a mixture of fear and joy.

413
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,847
I'm in love with Robert.

414
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,891
I cannot help myself.

415
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:10,854
Today I gave myself
to him completely.

416
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,732
I'm alive at the
sound of his voice,

417
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,692
the touch of his hand.

418
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,945
He is the master of my body.

419
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:24,743
How can I tell Louis?

420
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:28,914
That I can never marry him because I
have met another man.

421
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:55,691
Get away from here.

422
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,151
Get out of here, I have a gun.

423
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:59,254
Tom, I didn't hear you come up.

424
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:02,007
Oh you brought my car.

425
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:03,216
Thank you.

426
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,760
You have company today?

427
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,803
Oh just a local boy.

428
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,097
I hired him to help
me around the house.

429
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:11,224
Would you like to come
in for a few minutes?

430
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:12,434
Thanks just the same.

431
00:39:12,768 --> 00:39:13,518
But not now.

432
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,565
Jane, what's the matter?

433
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:25,489
- Somebody broke into
the house last night.

434
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:26,907
I don't know what it is

435
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,492
but there's something
strange going on

436
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:30,911
andljustcanT
put my finger on it.

437
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,287
- Nothing happened
to you, did it?

438
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,747
No, I'm fine.

439
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:35,374
It's just I'm a little scared.

440
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:36,875
Let's go out tonight, Jane.

441
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:38,502
Maybe you need to relax.

442
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,587
I'd love to get out.

443
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:41,588
Eight o'clock.

444
00:39:41,922 --> 00:39:42,756
Good.

445
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,007
Should I dress?

446
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,802
- Whatever you
wear will be fine.

447
00:39:48,178 --> 00:39:49,679
- Tom, do you want me
to give you a lift?

448
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:50,806
No.

449
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,682
It'll be no trouble at all.

450
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:54,643
I'll see you tonight.

451
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,001
Just a minute.

452
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:25,961
I'm coming.

453
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:33,176
Hello?

454
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:34,135
Hi.

455
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:36,805
Come in.

456
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,265
Oh, look at those.

457
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,977
I picked these at my place.

458
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,396
Tom, they're beautiful.

459
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,773
I'll just put them in this.

460
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:52,112
There we are.

461
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:55,240
That'll be the first thing
I see when I come in.

462
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:57,075
Well how nice.

463
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:57,951
Shall we?

464
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,415
Where are we going?

465
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:05,709
- I have a little
surprise for you.

466
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:06,793
0h?

467
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,007
- Why did you come
to Blackford, Jane?

468
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:16,303
- I wanted to try and find
some place where I could relax.

469
00:43:18,179 --> 00:43:20,056
And when my mother died and
left me my aunt's old house,

470
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,058
I decided to come here.

471
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:28,607
I was married up until
a few months ago.

472
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,152
When my marriage ended,
I nearly cracked up.

473
00:43:32,485 --> 00:43:35,780
It was something I never
believed could happen to me.

474
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,907
I was very sick for a while

475
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,326
but things are better now.

476
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:40,285
What about yourself?

477
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:41,411
Are you married?

478
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:42,287
No.

479
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:50,920
Do you live in Blackford?

480
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:51,796
Yes.

481
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,060
Tom look, over there.

482
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:06,353
What?

483
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:07,354
There's somebody following us.

484
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:08,313
Over there.

485
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:15,236
Did you see that light?

486
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,615
You'd better sit down.

487
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,283
It's probably kids.

488
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:24,120
That's County Road and a
notorious lover's lane.

489
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:25,538
I'm not so sure.

490
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,957
Seems every time we meet,

491
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:32,712
I'm afraid of something or I
think someone's following me.

492
00:44:33,046 --> 00:44:34,964
Is someone after you?

493
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:36,216
I don't know.

494
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:37,550
Maybe I'm imagining things.

495
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:44,849
It's so quiet and peaceful here.

496
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,646
I wish I could just
stay here forever.

497
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:53,858
- The only thing that
lasts forever is true love.

498
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:56,611
Even after death.

499
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,613
That's beautiful, Tom.

500
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:09,124
Shouldn't we be getting
back to the real world soon?

501
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:13,253
I don't want my aunt to
see me coming in late.

502
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,965
I'm only kidding.

503
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:34,441
Thank you, Tom, for
a lovely evening.

504
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,276
Would you like to come
by tomorrow for lunch?

505
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:37,444
I'd love to.

506
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:38,862
Wonderful.

507
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,613
About one o'clock?

508
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:41,489
Yes.

509
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,870
I hope you'll stay here
with us for a while.

510
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:48,872
I just might do that.

511
00:45:56,296 --> 00:45:57,630
See you tomorrow.

512
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:00,925
Goodnight, Tom.

513
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:12,687
I went into Blackford
today and told Louis

514
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:15,732
I could not marry him
because I love someone else.

515
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,358
He cursed me and accused me

516
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,736
of having been secretly in
love with Robert all along.

517
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:21,863
I didn't deny it.

518
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:23,406
I am obsessed.

519
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:27,702
Making love to Robert was at
once joyful and terrifying.

520
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:30,413
I have no control.

521
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,416
If Robert ever left
me, I would die.

522
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:41,341
How simple things were before
Robert came into my life.

523
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:44,594
I love him and fear
him at the same time.

524
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:47,305
I fear his power over me

525
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:49,015
and I know I will
do anything he asks.

526
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,421
I know now what
Robert wants from me.

527
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:22,841
He has admitted that he's
involved in something

528
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,051
I never suspected.

529
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:27,345
It's almost impossible
for me to believe.

530
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:28,513
But it is true.

531
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:31,891
He wants me to join him
in a pact with Satan.

532
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:44,904
What the hell do you want?

533
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,413
What do you want?

534
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,418
Get away from me.

535
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,169
Get away from here.

536
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:50,668
Now Lois, I'm sorry I
told you about this.

537
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:53,212
I don't want you to be upset.

538
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:55,590
It was definitely a dream.

539
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:56,799
Just a dream.

540
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:00,845
Took me hours to
calm myself down

541
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,471
but I'm okay now.

542
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,308
Listen, I met somebody.

543
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,853
Yeah, he's from around here.

544
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:11,981
His name is Tom.

545
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:16,611
Well, he's kind
of old-fashioned.

546
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:17,653
Very pleasant.

547
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,657
It's kind of strange.

548
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:23,743
I'm very drawn to him.

549
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:27,205
It's as though I've
known him all my life.

550
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,084
Well, now don't go overboard.

551
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:36,172
You'll be the first one
to know if that happens.

552
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:39,425
Alright.

553
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:43,930
Well I'm glad I reached you.

554
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:47,391
Alright I Will.

555
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:48,184
I'll talk to you in
the next couple days.

556
00:53:48,517 --> 00:53:49,727
Take care.

557
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:51,312
Alright, bye bye.

558
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:07,703
- You're not getting
any action off her.

559
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:12,833
- Well I think I
got a lot farther

560
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,377
than you guys think.

561
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,378
Uh yeah?

562
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,255
You ain't got nowhere.

563
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,590
She kissed me.

564
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:24,762
Hi.

565
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:26,847
Hi Paul,

566
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,307
how are you today?

567
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:34,647
Oh yeah,

568
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:37,566
I got the stuff you wanted.

569
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:38,651
You know I'll get
the rest of the pipe

570
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:41,028
as soon as my dad
gets it fitted.

571
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:42,321
And then you know,

572
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:43,281
I'll bring it out
this afternoon.

573
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:44,657
Oh listen, about today Paul,

574
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,908
you don't have to
bother coming out.

575
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:47,868
I have a friend coming over

576
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,955
and well, quite frankly, I
had a rough time last night

577
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:52,748
and I'd just as soon catch up

578
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:55,376
on a little sleep
this afternoon.

579
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:56,377
What happened?

580
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:57,378
Someone break into your house?

581
00:54:57,712 --> 00:54:59,046
Oh no, no.

582
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,757
I just haven't been
sleeping too well lately.

583
00:55:02,091 --> 00:55:04,719
Tomorrow will be fine, okay?

584
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,512
Okay yeah, I'll see you then.

585
00:55:06,846 --> 00:55:08,222
See you tomorrow.

586
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:09,265
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

587
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:10,266
Take care.

588
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:11,851
<i>Okay, 'We-</i>

589
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:13,519
Bye_

590
00:55:15,021 --> 00:55:17,273
Ooh, she is something else.

591
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:43,382
- Why Miss Hardy, what
a pleasant surprise.

592
00:55:45,051 --> 00:55:46,010
You're a bit early
for Sunday but...

593
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:47,720
That woman.

594
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:49,013
Miss Percy?

595
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:50,556
Why she's our choir mistress.

596
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:51,974
Do you know her?

597
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:54,727
- I'm positive she was in
a dream I had last night.

598
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:57,021
She was right here
in the church.

599
00:55:57,355 --> 00:56:00,191
- Indeed she was,
until around seven.

600
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,777
But I'm so sure.

601
00:56:04,236 --> 00:56:06,864
- The mind can play
many tricks on us, Jane.

602
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:09,617
I feel something's
troubling you.

603
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:14,789
I'd like to help,
if you'll let me.

604
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:16,374
Thank you, Reverend.

605
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,501
That's very kind of you.

606
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:20,252
But not right now.

607
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:24,799
- By the way, that locket,
where did you get it?

608
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:26,967
Oh it belonged to my aunt.

609
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,804
- I wouldn't show it to too
many people, if I were you.

610
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,680
It's the devil's sign.

611
00:56:33,057 --> 00:56:34,308
You're not in league
with Satan are you?

612
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:36,227
No, no.

613
00:56:37,645 --> 00:56:38,938
Thank you for
telling me, reverend.

614
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:39,980
Thank you.

615
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:40,856
Anytime.

616
00:56:54,662 --> 00:56:58,791
- Well it all started
happening when I began reading

617
00:56:59,125 --> 00:56:59,667
the diary.

618
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:06,006
First the nightmares, if
indeed they were nightmares.

619
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,717
Then the church.

620
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,388
You don't suppose

621
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:15,975
that this locket could have
anything to do with it, do you?

622
00:57:16,308 --> 00:57:18,561
Or do you just think I'm crazy?

623
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,982
- No, I don't
think you're crazy.

624
00:57:23,315 --> 00:57:25,151
This locket is a
beautiful, old heirloom.

625
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:26,569
And that's all.

626
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,616
Most of the people in
Blackford would love

627
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,327
to see you give up and go away.

628
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:40,374
You're not going to let them
chase you out of here, are you?

629
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:45,671
I'm hoping you'll stay
around for a while.

630
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:47,089
Maybe I will.

631
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:03,856
Good evening, Jane.

632
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,692
What are you doing here?

633
00:58:07,026 --> 00:58:08,777
I brought the probate papers.

634
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:10,571
How did you get in?

635
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,073
I rang the bell.

636
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:16,327
Nobody answered
so I used my key.

637
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,037
How dare you?

638
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,165
- You remind me
of your late aunt.

639
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:24,585
How are things going?

640
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:28,130
Made any friends in town lately?

641
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:31,592
- You know damn well how
the people around here

642
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:33,427
feel about me.

643
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:34,720
So I do.

644
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:35,971
- Well then perhaps
you'd tell me why

645
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:39,016
if you know half as
much as you pretend to.

646
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,519
- Oh I know a lot
more than that.

647
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:46,440
I know what your
aunt did here too.

648
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:50,110
You don't seem to be surprised

649
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,029
at what I'm going to say.

650
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:55,616
Go on.

651
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:59,411
She worshiped the devil.

652
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,330
I know that.

653
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:05,084
- She and that
boyfriend of hers Robert

654
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:08,671
were very badly thought
of around Blackford,

655
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:12,132
very badly thought of
to the day she died.

656
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:15,886
Do you know how she died?

657
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,847
- Oh no no, nobody
knows how she died.

658
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:22,226
Everybody knows
about the accident.

659
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,144
I remember hearing about that

660
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:25,563
when I was little.

661
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:31,527
- Then you know
about the hearse.

662
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:33,112
You maybe even...

663
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:37,700
- What the hell are
you talking about?

664
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:39,952
I'm talking about the hearse

665
00:59:40,286 --> 00:59:44,081
that carried your aunts body.

666
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,001
It crashed

667
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,128
on the Blackford bridge.

668
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:52,464
It exploded into flames
and all that was left

669
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:58,220
was a charred mass of metal.

670
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,682
Stranger than that,

671
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:04,685
there was no sign of the driver.

672
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,979
Or the your aunt's coffin.

673
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,942
That Robert fellow,
he just disappeared.

674
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:13,527
Come on, Pritchard.

675
01:00:13,861 --> 01:00:15,112
Well in the paper

676
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:17,406
they called it some
sort of freak accident.

677
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:23,787
But I'm not so sure about that.

678
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:26,582
What aren't you so sure about?

679
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:33,088
- Well some people say that
the devil himself reached up

680
01:00:34,882 --> 01:00:36,634
and grabbed that hearse

681
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:41,639
and dragged it down to
the fiery depths of hell

682
01:00:44,183 --> 01:00:47,770
and it's still roaming
the old county road

683
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,521
in search of victims.

684
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,649
You bastard.

685
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:55,027
It's been you all along.

686
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:57,279
Now I don't know anything
about that accident.

687
01:00:57,613 --> 01:00:59,823
But I do know that you're
the one that's been driving

688
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,158
that hearse.

689
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:03,494
What are you talking about?

690
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:07,164
- Oh you know damn well
what I'm talking about.

691
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,416
And I'm not going to let
you push me around anymore.

692
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:11,794
Please get out of my house.

693
01:01:13,128 --> 01:01:15,172
You ought to see a doctor.

694
01:01:15,506 --> 01:01:17,216
You're beginning
to imagine things.

695
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:18,217
Goodnight, Mr. Pritchard.

696
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,677
Goodnight, Jane.

697
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,723
Pleasant dreams.

698
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:53,771
Well I'm up for the night.

699
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:25,946
Help me quickly.

700
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:27,865
Now hold on a second.

701
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,283
Somebody's trying to kill me.

702
01:04:29,616 --> 01:04:30,284
What's that?

703
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:31,368
Please, he's after me.

704
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:32,744
Help me.

705
01:04:33,078 --> 01:04:35,038
- Hey, we've got
something over here.

706
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:36,331
Well isn't this Jane.

707
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:37,541
Sheriff, quickly,

708
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:39,209
somebody's trying to kill me.

709
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:40,294
Uh yeah?

710
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,045
Oh no, come.

711
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,339
- This is getting to be quite
a popular sport around here.

712
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:47,301
Open season on good
looking city girls.

713
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,011
Jack, you dumb son of a bitch,

714
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,512
I'm telling you the truth.

715
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:52,431
- Hey that's mighty
strong language lady.

716
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:54,683
You're asking for trouble
talking like that.

717
01:04:55,017 --> 01:04:57,102
- Five minutes ago, sheriff,
somebody tried to kill me

718
01:04:57,436 --> 01:04:58,520
in my house.

719
01:04:58,854 --> 01:05:01,106
Now are you going to come and
do something about it or not?

720
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,443
- These city woman are
goddamn crazy, you know that?

721
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:05,944
Oh god.

722
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:44,524
Oh god, it's happening
all over again.

723
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:50,322
Please, dear god, I won't be
able to live through it again.

724
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:56,495
Hello?

725
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:57,871
Hello in there.

726
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:05,712
See there's the drawer.

727
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:07,673
I left it open last
night when I ran out.

728
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:09,591
Come on, you'll see.

729
01:06:15,764 --> 01:06:19,351
I swear, he drove his hand
right through that door.

730
01:06:19,685 --> 01:06:22,354
- All I see here Jane is nothing
so much out of the ordinary

731
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:25,691
and exactly what
I expected to see.

732
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,818
You had a nightmare.

733
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:32,114
Produced by all that talk
of the occult in the diary.

734
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:34,324
I'm not crazy.

735
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:36,410
I'm not.

736
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:40,455
I said nightmare, Jane.

737
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:43,458
Now you're not going to
let some dreams get to you,

738
01:06:43,792 --> 01:06:44,918
are you?

739
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:47,212
You're stronger than that.

740
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:49,423
I guess so.

741
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:51,049
Good.

742
01:06:51,383 --> 01:06:51,925
Good.

743
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:55,262
Jane you have got
to rely on yourself.

744
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,014
No dreams, no devils.

745
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:00,058
Look to yourself, Jane,

746
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:03,270
and then look to God.

747
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:05,480
You may be right.

748
01:07:05,814 --> 01:07:08,316
But what it was
so goddamned real.

749
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:13,697
- Damn real, but still
all in your mind.

750
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,833
Oh why hello, Paul.

751
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:26,960
Haven't seen you in
church lately, have I?

752
01:07:27,294 --> 01:07:29,004
Well I've been sick.

753
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:30,505
Yes, I'm sure.

754
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:32,507
Goodbye, Jane.

755
01:07:32,841 --> 01:07:34,176
Take care of yourself.

756
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:35,844
Remember, be strong.

757
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:38,263
<i>I'll try.</i>

758
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:39,931
Thank you.

759
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,602
- I didn't know he
made house calls.

760
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:46,313
This was a special occasion.

761
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,567
Speaking of appointments,
don't you have one on the roof?

762
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:52,986
Yeah, I brought you this.

763
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:00,911
It's beautiful.

764
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:06,958
There.

765
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:11,463
It's just perfect.

766
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:13,256
I hope you like it.

767
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:17,427
You don't know how much.

768
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,054
Thank you, Paul.

769
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:23,809
Now, come on.

770
01:08:24,142 --> 01:08:27,521
I bet you can't get the
roof done by sundown.

771
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:28,980
I bet you I can.

772
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:44,579
- Hey looks like
lover boy's back.

773
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,623
Let's see how he did.

774
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:52,045
Hi guys.

775
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:53,588
Hey whoa whoa whoa.

776
01:08:53,922 --> 01:08:55,465
So how did it go, hot shot?

777
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:56,675
Did you get any?

778
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,094
- I don't think that any
of your business, guys.

779
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:02,472
- That's not a very
nice way to talk, is it?

780
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:04,766
I did alright, you know.

781
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,227
Well come on.

782
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:08,395
Sort of.

783
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,105
Well what do you mean sort of?

784
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:12,691
I mean you either did
or you didn't, right?

785
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:14,067
You're all talk.

786
01:09:14,401 --> 01:09:16,403
Well we made out.

787
01:09:16,736 --> 01:09:17,404
Bullshit.

788
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:21,408
Did she have her clothes off?

789
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:22,659
Well kinda.

790
01:09:22,993 --> 01:09:24,619
You really go to her, huh?

791
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:26,955
I bet you were hard as a pistol.

792
01:09:27,289 --> 01:09:30,083
Yeah, better believe it, yeah.

793
01:09:30,417 --> 01:09:32,002
Okay, nice chatting with you.

794
01:09:36,423 --> 01:09:37,090
See you.

795
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:56,776
Oh my god.

796
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:07,722
Oh what are you doing down here?

797
01:11:09,266 --> 01:11:11,851
- I saw the lights
go out as I drove up.

798
01:11:12,185 --> 01:11:13,478
I thought you might
be in trouble.

799
01:11:13,812 --> 01:11:14,646
Who me?

800
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:17,732
And then when Reverend
Winston convinced me

801
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:21,695
that it was a nightmare, I
really felt like killing myself.

802
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:25,073
- You're a very
strong woman, Jane.

803
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:27,450
It's good to see you like this.

804
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:30,036
Most women I know would
have been gone by now.

805
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:32,580
- Well, out here I'm
learning, for the first time,

806
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,833
how to take care of myself.

807
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:36,084
It feels good.

808
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:37,752
It feels great.

809
01:11:38,086 --> 01:11:41,464
If I don't get myself
killed in the process.

810
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,342
- You're beautiful
when you laugh.

811
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:48,263
Would you like some coffee?

812
01:11:48,596 --> 01:11:49,973
Yes, sure.

813
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:53,893
Oh don't bother with that.

814
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:55,854
I'll take care of it.

815
01:11:56,187 --> 01:11:57,856
No, it's not problem.

816
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:01,234
- Robert talks of
nothing else now.

817
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:05,113
I can't bear the thought of
our ever being separated.

818
01:12:05,447 --> 01:12:07,073
He believes we can live forever.

819
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:11,119
Even beyond death,
if I agree as he has

820
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:12,996
to do Satan's bidding.

821
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:17,751
I'm being torn apart
by my love for him.

822
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:21,963
And this terrible choice
he has asked me to make.

823
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:23,673
But what can I do?

824
01:12:28,053 --> 01:12:29,429
And that's it.

825
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:32,640
That's the last entry
she made before she died.

826
01:12:32,974 --> 01:12:33,808
Incredible.

827
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,144
To live forever.

828
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:40,899
Do you believe a thing
like that could happen?

829
01:12:41,232 --> 01:12:44,861
- No, but in some
deranged diabolical way,

830
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:47,989
Robert convinced my
aunt that it could.

831
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:54,245
Suppose it could happen, Jane.

832
01:12:58,792 --> 01:13:01,044
Suppose you could live forever.

833
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:03,421
Span the ages.

834
01:13:03,755 --> 01:13:07,050
Wouldn't that be
worth everything?

835
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:08,426
I don't know.

836
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:13,640
You're not serious, are you?

837
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:17,894
- Of course, I believe
in all that stuff.

838
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:24,984
- I was getting carried
away again, wasn't I?

839
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:27,987
I guess it's all the things
that have been happening.

840
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,948
What it amounts to is

841
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:33,660
one woman alone
in a lonely house

842
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,871
with a very vivid imagination,

843
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,958
sometimes too active
an imagination.

844
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:45,755
Tom!

845
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:48,466
There she is.

846
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:50,802
That's the witch.

847
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:52,429
There are your spooks.

848
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:54,222
Witch witch.

849
01:13:54,556 --> 01:13:55,765
Oh, no.

850
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,226
Witch witch.

851
01:14:00,687 --> 01:14:03,898
- Apparently I have
quite a reputation.

852
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,025
Even among the
younger set in town.

853
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:07,819
- You do live in the
local haunted house.

854
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:10,071
And I plan to stay here.

855
01:14:10,405 --> 01:14:12,991
Kids, do you believe it?

856
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:15,577
And here I thought that scarred
face man was coming back

857
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:16,911
to get me.

858
01:14:17,245 --> 01:14:17,954
- I don't think you'll
be seeing him anymore.

859
01:14:18,288 --> 01:14:19,497
Neither do I.

860
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:22,208
Tom, would you like to
come back for dinner again?

861
01:14:22,542 --> 01:14:23,501
When?

862
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:27,005
- Would tomorrow
night be too soon?

863
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:28,047
I'd love to.

864
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,733
Up late last night, huh?

865
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,860
Oh a little yes.

866
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:55,028
Would you like some coffee?

867
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,447
Uh no thanks, I just ate.

868
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:01,075
Have a good time last night?

869
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:02,410
Yeah, pretty good.

870
01:17:02,744 --> 01:17:04,329
Out with that Tom guy.

871
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:05,705
You must like him, huh.

872
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:08,207
Yeah, I like him, huh.

873
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,710
Did he stay here last night?

874
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:17,008
- I don't think that's any
of your business, Paul.

875
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:27,101
So, how are things at the store?

876
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:29,145
Oh same old thing.

877
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:30,271
Kind of boring.

878
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:41,824
I was wondering if you
wanted to, felt like,

879
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:45,453
maybe we could go
see a movie tonight.

880
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:48,039
We'd have to drive
a few hundred miles

881
01:17:48,373 --> 01:17:50,124
but it'd be great.

882
01:17:50,458 --> 01:17:51,125
I'm sorry, Paul.

883
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:52,710
I'm busy tonight.

884
01:17:54,212 --> 01:17:55,254
You're busy tonight?

885
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:56,130
Mmhmm.

886
01:17:57,382 --> 01:17:58,716
You going outwith Tom?

887
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:00,093
As a matter of fact, yes.

888
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:01,052
Geez.

889
01:18:06,265 --> 01:18:06,891
Oh, dammit.

890
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:09,102
I'm sorry.

891
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:10,937
It's okay.

892
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,689
Now listen, Paul,

893
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:15,066
the last thing in the
world that I want to do

894
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,818
is to hurt you.

895
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,152
You know that, don't you?

896
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:19,237
Come on now.

897
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:22,115
Yeah, I understand.

898
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:25,785
I'm a little young.

899
01:18:27,453 --> 01:18:31,249
- But you're not too young
for us to still be friends.

900
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:35,294
Yeah.

901
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:39,590
Sorry about the vase.

902
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:41,551
Don't worry about it.

903
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:45,304
- Well look if that Tom
guy doesn't work out,

904
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:50,143
I'm going to be back
here in a couple years

905
01:18:50,476 --> 01:18:52,270
to give him a run for his money.

906
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:56,107
I like you Jane, a lot.

907
01:18:56,441 --> 01:18:59,861
- Where were you when
I was 16 years old?

908
01:19:00,194 --> 01:19:01,988
Nevermind, don't answer that.

909
01:19:02,321 --> 01:19:03,322
I don't want to know.

910
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:06,284
I better get back to work.

911
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:08,703
I'll see you soon.

912
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:09,579
Bye,PauL

913
01:19:15,752 --> 01:19:17,837
I'll call you right back.

914
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:31,184
- I know you see
me, Mr. Pritchard,

915
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:33,060
so you might just
as well look up.

916
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:34,270
Good afternoon, Miss Hardy,

917
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:35,855
and good bye.

918
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:37,440
I am very busy.

919
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:38,566
I simply haven't got time...

920
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:40,193
I've signed the papers.

921
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:41,569
I'm staying in Blackford.

922
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:44,197
- I trust you'll still need
to put the house on the market

923
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,490
when you leave in the fall.

924
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:48,159
I might not be
leaving in the fall.

925
01:19:48,493 --> 01:19:51,329
- What the hell are
you talking about?

926
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:54,540
- Well I simply haven't
made up my mind yet.

927
01:19:54,874 --> 01:19:57,335
Well I'm damned if you do.

928
01:19:57,668 --> 01:20:00,004
Afew days ago, I heard
you were so damn scared,

929
01:20:00,338 --> 01:20:02,507
I thought I'd never
see you again.

930
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:05,676
Now you're talking
about living here.

931
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:10,181
There are the papers.

932
01:20:10,515 --> 01:20:11,933
When are you going
to get them filed?

933
01:20:12,266 --> 01:20:15,019
This is late Friday afternoon.

934
01:20:15,353 --> 01:20:18,272
I'm not about to be going
over to the county seat.

935
01:20:18,606 --> 01:20:20,733
I'll get around
to them on Monday,

936
01:20:21,067 --> 01:20:22,443
well, maybe Tuesday.

937
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:23,319
Monday.

938
01:20:25,112 --> 01:20:27,824
- Seems to me you're
acting damn cocky.

939
01:20:28,157 --> 01:20:29,367
What the hell's going on here?

940
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,243
Nothing.

941
01:20:31,661 --> 01:20:34,247
- I ran into that young
Gordon boy that you hired,

942
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,581
Paul.

943
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:38,543
Took the liberty of asking
him a few questions.

944
01:20:38,876 --> 01:20:42,380
- My personal life is
none of your business.

945
01:20:42,713 --> 01:20:45,716
- Paul seemed, well,
completely bent out of shape.

946
01:20:46,092 --> 01:20:53,432
Something about
another man named Tom?

947
01:20:54,600 --> 01:21:00,022
- Pritchard, why don't you
just climb into the back

948
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:04,360
of that silly old hearse
of yours and drop dead.

949
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:44,567
Sullivan, S U L L
IVA N, Thomas.

950
01:21:44,901 --> 01:21:46,611
That's right.

951
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:48,696
Are you sure?

952
01:21:51,032 --> 01:21:53,826
Well maybe it's an
unlisted number.

953
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:57,079
No.

954
01:21:58,623 --> 01:22:00,374
Okay, thank you, operator.

955
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:06,464
Tom, I was wondering what...

956
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,424
flaughs)

957
01:22:08,758 --> 01:22:09,467
Lois.

958
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:12,136
Yes, I was expecting
someone else.

959
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:15,139
Well that fellow I
was telling you about.

960
01:22:15,473 --> 01:22:19,352
Busy, going out of my mind.

961
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:31,739
I don't know.

962
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:34,909
It's just something
about this place.

963
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:35,785
Something.

964
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,961
The man with the scar again.

965
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:47,338
I know, everyone says that.

966
01:22:56,514 --> 01:22:58,099
Maybe it was a dream.

967
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:10,528
As a matter of fact, he was
supposed to be here for dinner

968
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:11,654
right now.

969
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,410
Oh Lois, that
would be wonderful.

970
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,537
Any weekend would be fine.

971
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:20,538
As a matter of fact.

972
01:23:23,791 --> 01:23:24,458
Lois?

973
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:25,501
Hello?

974
01:24:00,453 --> 01:24:01,996
Run on, run on you.

975
01:24:03,873 --> 01:24:07,293
House robbing, grave
robbing, city bitch.

976
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:11,672
You want ghosts?

977
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:14,258
I'll give you ghosts.

978
01:24:24,769 --> 01:24:26,604
Tom, Tom, where are you?

979
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:33,360
Hey, give an old man a lift.

980
01:24:33,694 --> 01:24:34,236
Hey!

981
01:24:36,197 --> 01:24:38,574
Lift for an old ghost.

982
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:43,579
Son of a bitch,
I'll get you too.

983
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:53,047
Anybody there?

984
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:55,257
Anybody there?

985
01:25:17,196 --> 01:25:17,738
Jane?

986
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:23,661
Jane?

987
01:25:28,124 --> 01:25:28,791
Jane?

988
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:40,386
Jane?

989
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:08,247
Tom?

990
01:26:11,292 --> 01:26:12,459
Are you in there?

991
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:02,218
Tom?

992
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:47,554
No.

993
01:27:50,724 --> 01:27:51,392
No, no, no.

994
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:01,568
Paul?

995
01:29:53,514 --> 01:29:54,181
Jane.

996
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:37,015
Hello, Jane.

997
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:40,894
Get away from me.

998
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:42,479
Get away.

999
01:30:42,813 --> 01:30:44,273
I've been waiting, Jane.

1000
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:46,984
I've waited a long time.

1001
01:30:47,317 --> 01:30:48,652
There is no Tom.

1002
01:30:48,986 --> 01:30:50,904
Come with me.

1003
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:53,365
There is only Robert.

1004
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:03,125
Paul?

1005
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:05,669
Paul...

1006
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:08,046
Oh god, no.

1007
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,089
Not the child.

1008
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:18,015
No.

1009
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:38,035
Jane.

1010
01:31:40,287 --> 01:31:41,038
I love you.

1011
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:50,005
Don't fight me, Jane.

1012
01:31:50,339 --> 01:31:51,131
No.

1013
01:31:51,465 --> 01:31:52,799
What about the boy?

1014
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:53,926
The old man.

1015
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:55,969
It doesn't matter.

1016
01:31:57,971 --> 01:32:00,182
I can give you eternal life.

1017
01:32:00,516 --> 01:32:02,226
Our love just as we are.

1018
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:05,812
Forever.

1019
01:32:08,232 --> 01:32:09,650
Jane, I love you.

1020
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:14,321
I need you.

1021
01:32:41,181 --> 01:32:43,058
This is madness.

1022
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:43,934
It's not happening.

1023
01:32:44,268 --> 01:32:45,435
It's not possible.

1024
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:46,228
Jane.

1025
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:47,271
It is possible.

1026
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:49,022
Your aunt Rebecca was weak.

1027
01:32:49,356 --> 01:32:50,983
She was afraid.

1028
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:52,192
We can do it.

1029
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:58,740
We can have our love forever.

1030
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:16,675
Satan, get thee behind me.

1031
01:33:18,176 --> 01:33:20,762
And cast thy servants
back into hell.

1032
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:41,158
Jane!

1033
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:44,661
You can't fight him alone.

1034
01:35:57,961 --> 01:35:59,796
You're not going to get me.

1035
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:01,298
You're not going to get me.

1036
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:02,299
You're not, you're not.

1037
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:31,036
Damn you.

1038
01:36:32,913 --> 01:36:33,580
Damn you.
