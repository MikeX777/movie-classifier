00:01:17,834 --> 00:01:21,535
"This film is based on true accounts..."

2
00:01:21,634 --> 00:01:24,401
"...that took place at a school
for the deaf in 2005"

3
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:28,901
<i>It will either rain or snow
at some cities.</i>

4
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:32,767
<i>It will also be foggy in the morning.</i>

5
00:01:32,868 --> 00:01:36,535
<i>There will also be some cities in the
east and west region which will be foggy.</i>

6
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,134
<i>Temperature will be similar to yesterday.</i>

7
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:40,500
<i>Negative two degrees Celsius in Seoul.</i>

00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:42,034
<i>Negative one degrees Celsius in Daejeon.</i>

<i>Negative one degrees Celsius in Gwangju.</i>

00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:45,035
<i>Negative one degrees Celsius in Mujin.</i>

11
00:01:59,334 --> 00:02:01,235
<i>You're still not there?</i>

12
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,934
I can't tell where
I am because of the fog.

13
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,066
<i>That means you're almost there.</i>

14
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,701
<i>Mujin is a foggy town.</i>

15
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:18,334
What's Sol doing?

16
00:02:18,434 --> 00:02:19,534
<i>She's sleeping.</i>

17
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:23,535
<i>She cried all night saying she misses
her dad and just fell asleep.</i>

18
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:24,934
She cried a lot?

19
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:28,634
<i>Kids cry when 
they're away from their parents.</i>

20
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:32,435
<i>Don't worry, son.
Just do your job well there.</i>

21
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:36,801
<i>You went through a lot to get that job,
so stick to it like glue.</i>

22
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:37,769
<i>Got it?</i>

23
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:48,411
Mom, I'll call when I get...

24
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:36,967
"Welcome to Mujin"

25
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:50,467
"Silenced"

26
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,601
How much longer do I need to wait?

27
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:04,801
It's a busy day from the fog.

28
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:06,801
You'll have to wait for quite a bit.

29
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,801
Is there a bus to Ja Ae Academy from here?

30
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:19,634
Ja Ae Academy?

31
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:23,601
The school for the deaf?

32
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,300
There's no direct bus 
to such a secluded place.

33
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:31,301
Cab fare's is about 50,000 won.

34
00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:40,335
Wait. 
You're going to leave just like that?

35
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,700
I'm in a rush, so I'll come back tomorrow.

36
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,201
You should just leave the car here!

37
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,300
Damn it...

38
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,967
Hey, Mister.

39
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,133
Why did you suddenly back out 
without even looking!

40
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:03,868
Check your rear when backing up.

41
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:06,568
-What? I didn't even move.
-Mister!

42
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:09,402
Think you can talk your way out
just because I'm a girl?

43
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:10,968
But you got the wrong girl.

44
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,734
Mr Lee! Spray, please!

45
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,967
She's the one who hit me.

46
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:19,668
Smile.

47
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:21,802
"Mujin Human Rights Center"

48
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,534
Look, Miss.

49
00:05:23,934 --> 00:05:25,934
I haven't even started my engine.

50
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:31,435
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

51
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,467
Mr Lee! Come look.

52
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,977
This man is reeking of <i>soju</i>!

53
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:37,634
What?

54
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:40,668
I don't believe this.

55
00:05:40,901 --> 00:05:41,668
What?

56
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:47,168
Ms. Seo, I guess you drank
all night long again.

57
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:55,901
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:01,235
My insurance will cover the cost.

59
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,668
I guess you can't stand the cold.

60
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:16,968
I came out after drinking with co-workers.

61
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,068
And my glass was broken.

62
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,300
The fool ran away after messing my car but
he chose the wrong person to mess with.

63
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:27,168
Excuse me. Are we almost there?

64
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,034
In my line of work,
people can hold grudges.

65
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,901
It's similar to police inspectors.

66
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:38,035
I deal with pimps and bastards
who hit their wives.

67
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,867
I asked you how much further
do we need to go!

68
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,267
A grown man whining...

69
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:47,535
Why are you going to Ja Ae Academy?

70
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:49,534
I'm going there to teach kids.

71
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,168
Really?

72
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,101
You're a teacher?

73
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,500
Do you know sigh language?

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,501
What does that mean?

75
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,134
I can tell why people
have grudges against you.

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
"Mujin Human Rights Center, Seo Yujin"

77
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,667
Call me with the estimated cost.

78
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,168
Don't try to pull a broken neck on me 
or anything like that.

79
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:29,506
I'm really tight with
the cops in this town.

80
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,867
"Congratulations for being nominated as 
the best academy in Mujin"

81
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:04,735
Hello.

82
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:32,001
Tell the Chief of Administration
to come to the principal's office.

83
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:39,967
You were Professor Kim's student?

84
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,501
Yes. He was my college professor.

85
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:47,334
He drew that himself for me.

86
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,667
I see...

87
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:51,567
If you're his student...

88
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:53,901
I can trust you 100 percent.

89
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,334
He and I were in the same class throughout
the whole three years of high school.

90
00:09:01,701 --> 00:09:06,368
If he didn't suddenly switch to arts...

91
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,600
...we would've gone to college together.

92
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,335
You can just speak casually, sir.

93
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,435
No, I can't do that.

94
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,569
You're our teacher now.

95
00:09:16,701 --> 00:09:18,502
I shouldn't talk down to you.

96
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:22,601
Chief Lee?

97
00:09:23,267 --> 00:09:27,400
Meet our new art teacher from Seoul
who was recommended by Professor Kim.

98
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
I'm Kang Inho. Nice to meet you, sir.

99
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,934
You've never seen twins before?

100
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:40,935
Sorry, sir.

101
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,300
It's okay.

102
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,401
That's how everybody react to us
the first time they saw us.

103
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:48,467
You must be tired from the trip.

104
00:09:48,734 --> 00:09:52,001
Rest up and see you on Monday.

105
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:55,602
Chief Lee will direct
you with the details.

106
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:58,834
But what about the problem we have, 
Brother?

107
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:00,501
Chief Lee.

108
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,068
We're in school right now.

109
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,634
Principal Lee?

110
00:10:09,767 --> 00:10:12,134
How do we solve the problem?

111
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:15,034
I todl you that he came 
on Professor Kim's recommendation.

112
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,834
Are you kidding right now?

113
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,901
Why's a man from Seoul so senseless?

114
00:10:40,868 --> 00:10:42,769
It's usually one big one.

115
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:46,936
But since Professor Kim recommended you,
I'll take just five small ones.

116
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:50,502
You mean money?

117
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:53,901
Thought you could get
a teaching job for free?

118
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,334
My goodness.

119
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:58,635
I want it in cash.

120
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:05,401
<i>School development fund?</i>

121
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,533
Yes. Everyone has to pay.

122
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,734
<i>How much do they want?</i>

123
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:15,402
5,000,000 won.

124
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,901
<i>What? They ask for that much?</i>

125
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,667
They said it's a discount rate for me
since Professor Kim recommended me here.

126
00:11:23,868 --> 00:11:28,235
<i>Dang! How are we going to come up
with that much money?</i>

127
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:22,801
You're doing a really good job.

128
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,500
You have a talent in art.

129
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:56,801
Why are you so late for class?

130
00:12:58,767 --> 00:12:59,701
Hey!

131
00:13:06,434 --> 00:13:08,302
Minsu?

132
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:14,800
His younger brother died
in a train accident a few days ago.

133
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:18,235
He's not himself these days.

134
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,901
His one and only brother just died.
How could he not feel sad?

135
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:26,634
It's not just Minsu who's a bit strange.

136
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,767
There's something strange about the kids.

137
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:30,968
What's strange about them?

138
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,867
I can't really explain it one word.

139
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:40,635
It's your first time
at a school like this, right?

140
00:13:42,367 --> 00:13:45,767
Don't think of the kids here as normal.

141
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,068
A disability in body leads
to an impairment in mentality.

142
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:55,801
I've been with them
for over 10 years here.

143
00:13:57,367 --> 00:14:00,168
But they have yet 
to open their hearts to me.

144
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:13,267
Jeon Minsu?

145
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:20,567
"His father is bedridden 
and his mother ran away."

146
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:24,700
My gosh.

147
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:28,435
Jin Yuri.

148
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:33,434
"Mentally disabled. 
Mental age is 8-years-old."

149
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:38,201
"Has voracious appetite.
Needs special care."

150
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,034
Kim Yeondu.

151
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:57,602
"Father: Dead. Mother: Dead"

152
00:14:57,692 --> 00:14:59,181
She's an orphan?

153
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:11,968
I'm about to leave.

154
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:13,834
<i>Have you had dinner?</i>

155
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,001
I had something simple.

156
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:20,001
How's Sol? Did she eat?

157
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,467
<i>I fed her a few spoonfuls earlier.</i>

158
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,600
Why do you feed her so little?

159
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:29,068
<i>She had a fit because
she wanted pizza instead.</i>

160
00:15:29,801 --> 00:15:32,502
Why didn't you buy it for her then?

161
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:33,968
It doesn't cost much.

162
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,667
<i>I won't starve her.</i>

163
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:37,268
<i>Don't worry about her.</i>

164
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,601
<i>Check your account on the way home.</i>

165
00:15:41,501 --> 00:15:42,701
You got the money?

166
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:46,634
<i>Ask for new bills when you withdraw.</i>

167
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:30,001
Is someone in there?

168
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,600
Did something happen?

169
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,701
What are you doing?

170
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,900
I heard strange noises from inside.

171
00:16:52,968 --> 00:16:55,702
Still, you can't go
into the girls' bathroom.

172
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:58,068
What if a student sees you?

173
00:16:59,968 --> 00:17:02,469
You must not know since you're new.

174
00:17:02,534 --> 00:17:06,068
Kids here make strange noises for fun.

175
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:09,734
Since they can't hear,
they make those sounds on purpose.

176
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:15,401
I'm locking the front doors.
Go home, sir.

177
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:20,968
The audit is enough of a headache.

178
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,934
And the kids act up, too.

179
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:27,535
Sorry for all the trouble, Inspector Jang.

180
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:30,601
It's okay, sir.

181
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,100
Guiding kids to the right path
is a cop's job anyway.

182
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:38,467
But the kids never listen.

183
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:42,435
I told them over and over
not to go out at night.

184
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:47,001
What's the use of telling them
when they can't hear?

185
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:48,968
Oh, that makes sense.

186
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:00,801
Come on in.

187
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:05,334
School development fund is not illegal.

188
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,968
Right, Inspector Jang?

189
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:12,534
If my salary was bigger,
I'd donate to this school, too.

190
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:27,434
So, I heard you're from Seoul.
Are you settling in?

191
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:31,734
There's nothing much
to Mujin but the fog.

192
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:36,235
-It's fine.
-Excuse me.

193
00:18:37,501 --> 00:18:39,068
Let's have drinks sometime.

194
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:43,168
This town is pretty good
for guys to have fun.

195
00:18:43,234 --> 00:18:44,768
The girls are nice too.

196
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:51,634
Minsu.

197
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,467
It's not polite to stare
at your teacher like that.

198
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,934
-Hello.
-Stand straight.

199
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:04,833
Mr. Park?

200
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,134
What did he do 
that you're treating him like that?

201
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:11,500
This kid sneaked out
of the residence last night.

202
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,067
With two girls at that.

203
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:17,101
I was so worried.

204
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,267
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

205
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:26,834
His brother sneaked out and died.

206
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,201
Mr. Park? The principal wants to see you.

207
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,200
Minsu.

208
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:42,501
Don't you know how I feel?

209
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:48,068
Let's open up to each other more, okay?

210
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:33,268
What are you doing there?

211
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:34,635
Go back in!

212
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,433
Go back in, now!

213
00:20:39,534 --> 00:20:40,435
Hey!

214
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:42,635
Hey!

215
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,167
Come down from there!

216
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:57,567
What are you doing?

217
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:00,835
You could fall down!

218
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:02,035
What's wrong?

219
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:12,134
I'm sorry if I scared you.

220
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,100
I was worried about you.

221
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,400
What are you doing?

222
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,901
I'm giving her a lesson.

223
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,834
Who are you to give
her a lesson like that?

224
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:53,101
I'm Yoon Ja Ae, the residence counselor.

225
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:55,334
I'm in charge of after school education.

226
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,667
This doesn't concern you.

227
00:22:57,767 --> 00:23:00,234
You put a child in the laundry machine
and I'm supposed to let that happen?

228
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:01,435
Are you insane?

229
00:23:01,534 --> 00:23:03,868
The new teacher from Seoul...

230
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:06,935
...is a fool who doesn't know
to mind his own crap.

231
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,067
You think I can't do anything?

232
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:13,400
All my friends in Seoul
are prosecutors and lawyers!

233
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:16,435
Try that again and I'll make
sure you end up behind bars!

234
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,234
Yeondu!

235
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:43,402
Hello?

236
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:46,868
Who?

237
00:23:50,334 --> 00:23:52,235
Oh, right.

238
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:54,502
What is it?

239
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,700
I paid for your repairs.

240
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:07,133
There's beatings?

241
00:24:07,868 --> 00:24:09,135
The disabled children?

242
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,333
This isn't discrimination. It's assault.

243
00:24:18,701 --> 00:24:21,135
What were you doing
while she ended up like this?

244
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:27,767
Let's call her parents, first.

245
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,801
She's an orphan.

246
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:45,967
I heard from the Chief of Administatrion.

247
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:53,401
There was a problem with the way 
Ms. Yoon disciplines a child?

248
00:24:55,534 --> 00:24:58,801
Since she was a student from your class...

249
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:01,367
...I understand why you're upset.

250
00:25:03,133 --> 00:25:07,433
I gave Ms. Yoon a firm warning.

251
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,967
I hope you'd understand.

252
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:14,934
Ms. Yoon deeply regrets what happened.

253
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:19,135
She wants to apologize to Yeondu.

254
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:22,901
But Yeondu didn't come back
to the residence last night.

255
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:27,434
We're very worried about her because
she might get involved in an accident.

256
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:33,267
She wasn't well, so
I took her to a hospital.

257
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:36,901
Really? Is it really bad?

258
00:25:37,801 --> 00:25:41,435
No, they said she can leave tomorrow.

259
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:44,068
No need to worry, sir.

260
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,167
We'll bring her back then.

261
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:51,834
-So, which hospital is she at?
-So, which hospital is she at?

262
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:27,934
Yeondu couldn't come because she's sick.

263
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:33,202
Let's try this.

264
00:26:36,334 --> 00:26:42,334
You draw me and I'll draw you.

265
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:46,367
Why? You don't want to?

266
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,001
It's because of my bruises and scars...

267
00:26:53,634 --> 00:26:58,401
Don't worry. I'll make sure 
to draw you prettily.

268
00:27:27,367 --> 00:27:28,434
"Emegency Medical Treatment Centre"

269
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,201
<i>Where are you?</i>

270
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,767
We have to meet.

271
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:37,001
<i>I'm just getting off work.
I'll meet you at the hospital.</i>

272
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:42,168
Not the hospital.

273
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,300
<i>Let's meet outside.</i>

274
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:45,901
Okay, then.

275
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:46,834
Bye.

276
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:02,868
Is something wrong?

277
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:08,501
Yeondu was...

278
00:28:11,868 --> 00:28:13,435
...sexually molested.

279
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:17,400
By the principal.

280
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:24,400
By force...

281
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:30,369
He tried to but in the end, he failed.

282
00:28:32,334 --> 00:28:33,901
It's because she's too young.

283
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:39,268
That's nonsense.

284
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:42,835
Who said that?

285
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:45,801
You must've drunk again.

286
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:48,268
How many bottles this time?

287
00:28:51,026 --> 00:28:54,427
Yeondu wrote this last night.

288
00:29:06,901 --> 00:29:09,802
-"Who forced you to do the act?"
-"It's the principal."

289
00:29:09,934 --> 00:29:12,401
-"He forced you?"
-"I got beaten when I said no."

290
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:24,001
-"He forced you?"
-"I got beaten when I said no."

291
00:29:24,033 --> 00:29:26,300
-"Who else were forced to do it?"
-"Minsu, Yeongsu, Yuri."

292
00:29:29,868 --> 00:29:32,968
There are other kids 
who are going through the same thing, too.

293
00:29:36,634 --> 00:29:38,268
And there are other assailants too.

294
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:42,668
There's a teacher called
Park Bohyun.

295
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:46,702
He even molested boys.

296
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:52,534
<i>Don't you know how I feel?</i>

297
00:29:54,734 --> 00:29:58,501
-"Who else molests the children?"
-"The Principal, Chief Lee, Mr. Park."

298
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:04,201
Then...

299
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,834
You should report it to teh police.

300
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:15,601
The cops sent the kids
who went to report this back to school.

301
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:20,868
That's why they were beaten.

302
00:30:29,167 --> 00:30:32,801
The teacher, Yoon Ja Ae,
who beat Yeondu...

303
00:30:32,901 --> 00:30:36,702
...is actually 
the school founder's adopted daughter.

304
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:41,101
So, she's the principal's younger sister.

305
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:44,469
Kim Yeondu is admitted here, right?

306
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:47,368
Do you know what's even crazier?

307
00:30:49,434 --> 00:30:51,135
Yoon Ja Ae and the principal...

308
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,901
...are lovers.

309
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,268
She warned Yeondu while cutting her hair.

310
00:31:01,334 --> 00:31:03,035
If she flirts with the principal...

311
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:04,734
...she's dead.

312
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,734
Mister!

313
00:31:26,901 --> 00:31:27,869
Wait!

314
00:31:58,934 --> 00:32:01,635
"Mujin Human Rights Center"

315
00:32:05,701 --> 00:32:10,701
Last Thursday,
you were sexually molested...

316
00:32:12,901 --> 00:32:15,068
...by the principal of Ja Ae Academy.

317
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,334
Can you tell us what happened?

318
00:32:34,501 --> 00:32:37,835
After school that day...

319
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,234
...I changed clothes at the residence.

320
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,968
And then I went out to play in the yard.

321
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,234
I was playing with Yuri.

322
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:54,869
She went to the bathroom...

323
00:32:57,534 --> 00:32:58,968
...but didn't come back.

324
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,967
So, I went into the school
to look for Yuri.

325
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,034
<i>The principal...</i>

326
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:15,501
<i>...called me over to his office.</i>

327
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:21,034
<i>He took me...</i>

328
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,801
<i>...to the Principal's office.</i>

329
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:29,802
<i>The TV was turned on.</i>

330
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:34,100
<i>A man and a girl...</i>

331
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:38,501
<i>...were naked on the screen.</i>

332
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,567
The principal came in...

333
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:26,068
...and he...

334
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:29,701
...took off my pants.

335
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
<i>Hey!</i>

336
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:33,834
<i>It's raining cats and dogs outside.</i>

337
00:36:34,033 --> 00:36:37,300
<i>The sound of rain falling
on budding trees...</i>

338
00:36:37,767 --> 00:36:43,735
<i>...seems to whisper that 
the long, cold winter is finally over.</i>

339
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:50,034
<i>Open your windows and
listen to the falling rain.</i>

340
00:37:01,534 --> 00:37:02,668
It's okay.

341
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,467
Yeondu says she saw what happened.

342
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:24,469
<i>If you tell anyone else about this...</i>

343
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:32,134
..."I'll kill you".

344
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:54,267
<i>You don't know because you're new.</i>

345
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:58,202
<i>Kids here make strange noises for fun.</i>

346
00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:08,635
-Dad!
-Yes. Mom!

347
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:11,468
What took you so long to get the door?

348
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:14,701
Does teaching the deaf made you deaf too?

349
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:16,101
Why didn't you call?

350
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:20,101
What? A call? Do I need to make 
a reservation to come to my son's place?

351
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:22,467
What? Is this a hotel or something?

352
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,500
Still, why bring a sick child out here?

353
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,934
What? Did you forget?

354
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:34,067
Today is your late wife's
first year death anniversary.

355
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:45,935
So, how's school?

356
00:39:47,834 --> 00:39:48,901
It's all right.

357
00:39:49,868 --> 00:39:52,602
Why? They don't welcome newcomers?

358
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:56,401
Bear with them.

359
00:39:56,934 --> 00:40:00,501
Country folks can be like that. My gosh.

360
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,367
What's that?

361
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:12,001
I heard the principal loves orchids.

362
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:18,134
Professor Kim says your principal
has a lot of connections.

363
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:22,635
Some teachers got
recommendations from your principal.

364
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:25,867
And landed good jobs up in Seoul.

365
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:26,836
Mom!

366
00:40:28,734 --> 00:40:30,501
Do you know what kind of people they are?

367
00:40:33,801 --> 00:40:36,001
-Those people are...
-Yes, I know.

368
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:40,101
He demands cash for giving you a job!
Do you think a good guy would do that?

369
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,500
Do you know how I got that money?

370
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,435
It was my rental deposit.

371
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:46,934
You moved out?

372
00:40:47,934 --> 00:40:49,468
That's your house deposit?

373
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:52,867
Yes. 
Think I stole that money or something?

374
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,200
You never once brought money home.
How else would I get it?

375
00:40:57,534 --> 00:40:59,502
Still, that was your house!

376
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:01,301
Come on.

377
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,634
Suddenly acting like
the head of this family?

378
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:08,300
When you went
around the country to draw...

379
00:41:08,434 --> 00:41:12,834
...have you forgotten how your wife
and I raised Sol and supported you?

380
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:19,101
Your wife worried about Sol and
you till the day she died.

381
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,300
Dad, are you fighting with grandmother?

382
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:26,834
I don't want to hear
one more word out of you!

383
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,867
Just like the kids you teach,
close your ears and mouth...

384
00:41:30,968 --> 00:41:32,936
...and just do your job.

385
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:39,067
Sol! Are you okay?

386
00:41:39,367 --> 00:41:41,068
Mom! Hurry!

387
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:43,547
Oh my goodness.

388
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,901
My gosh. Here you go. My gosh.

389
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:48,434
-Oh, Sol.
-Sol. Breathe in.

390
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:50,988
One more time. That's good.

391
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:54,734
-Good. My gosh.
-That's right. My gosh.

392
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:12,200
I got a room in our old town.

393
00:42:13,834 --> 00:42:15,735
It's tiny, but good enough...

394
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:19,601
...for just Sol and me.

395
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,233
Inho.

396
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:28,601
Don't think of anything else but Sol.

397
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:30,434
Okay?

398
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,601
We request the principal
of Ja Ae Academy be discharged...

399
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:43,668
...and the sexual offenders be punished.

400
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:46,568
Sorry to interrupt.

401
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:49,333
Did the sexual...

402
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:52,101
...molestation...

403
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:56,701
...occur during class hours
or school period?

404
00:42:57,234 --> 00:43:00,434
If you watch the recorded testimonies...

405
00:43:01,267 --> 00:43:02,434
...after school, the kids...

406
00:43:02,534 --> 00:43:04,168
After school?

407
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:07,601
That's not our jurisdiction.

408
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:08,534
What?

409
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:10,101
Mr. Kim?

410
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,934
Is it within our jurisdiction
if something occurs after schooling hours?

411
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,767
That's under the City Hall's jurisdiction.

412
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,168
But the Principal,
Chief of Administration...

413
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:23,535
...and a teacher sexually
assaulted students at school!

414
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,601
The things is...

415
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,233
...Ja Ae Academy is in our jurisdiction.

416
00:43:27,868 --> 00:43:30,769
But the residence...

417
00:43:30,834 --> 00:43:33,034
...is under social welfare's
jurisdiction at City Hall.

418
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:39,201
Please go to City Hall
and talk to them about it.

419
00:43:39,434 --> 00:43:41,201
I've already been there.

420
00:43:43,234 --> 00:43:46,267
They said it happened
at school and to come here.

421
00:43:46,367 --> 00:43:49,534
What happens after school
is not our jurisdiction.

422
00:43:49,634 --> 00:43:50,502
Look lady!

423
00:43:52,267 --> 00:43:54,467
Children were abused at school!

424
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:55,634
But everybody says 
it's not their jurisidction!

425
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,535
Who could actually do something 
about this then?

426
00:43:58,567 --> 00:44:01,600
The Blue House? The White House?

427
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:05,234
City Hall.

428
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,601
Why aren't you investigating?

429
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:13,402
Children were molested
by the principal of the school!

430
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,968
Shouldn't you investigate?

431
00:44:16,067 --> 00:44:18,100
Of course we should.

432
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,134
Then, why aren't you?

433
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:24,934
Ms. Seo.

434
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:27,768
The principal 
is the elder of Mujin Church.

435
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,268
He's a devout Christian and is 
well-known as a respectable man.

436
00:44:34,133 --> 00:44:35,101
Here.

437
00:44:35,234 --> 00:44:38,202
I have the children's 
recorded testimonies.

438
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:42,901
This is the evidence!
But why can't you bring him in?

439
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,034
Look.

440
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:49,500
How can we handcuff him based
on what some deaf kids say?

441
00:44:49,834 --> 00:44:52,535
He received the governor's award 
a few days ago.

442
00:44:52,634 --> 00:44:55,268
Even with human rights and such
I can't just bring people like him in.

443
00:44:56,334 --> 00:44:58,668
You know that very well.

444
00:44:58,734 --> 00:45:01,101
What rights are you talking about
when he molested kids?!

445
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:07,435
Then, I'll go straight to
the district prosecutor's office.

446
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:09,469
By all means.
I'd be grateful if you do so.

447
00:45:10,033 --> 00:45:12,700
Don't think it's because
we don't want to investigate.

448
00:45:12,982 --> 00:45:16,115
It's because the prosecutors
haven't given us the okay.

449
00:45:16,431 --> 00:45:17,932
Bring us the order 
from court or something...

450
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,267
My goodness.

451
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:22,868
I hope my son becomes
a prosecutor not a cop.

452
00:45:41,868 --> 00:45:42,736
Hello?

453
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:44,968
It's me Younghoon.

454
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:48,401
<i>A TV station from Seoul
called to cover our case.</i>

455
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:49,469
Really?

456
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:51,934
Yes. Hurry back. 
They're on their way right now.

457
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:53,367
Okay. I'll be right there.

458
00:46:04,868 --> 00:46:05,669
Minsu?

459
00:46:05,801 --> 00:46:07,901
Get up. Don't lie down there. Come here.

460
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,767
Get up. Hurry.

461
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,967
Where are Yeondu and Yuri?

462
00:46:13,901 --> 00:46:16,568
You're close friends. Right?

463
00:46:18,534 --> 00:46:20,734
Stop grumbling and speak!

464
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:23,935
I can't understand your grumbling!

465
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,801
Looks like you're getting old, Mr. Park.

466
00:46:29,334 --> 00:46:31,601
Kids aren't scared of you anymore.

467
00:46:41,167 --> 00:46:42,300
Mr. Park?

468
00:46:43,868 --> 00:46:45,669
This is the principal's office.

469
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:48,772
Go some place quiet.

470
00:48:12,033 --> 00:48:15,934
"Mujin Human Rights Center"

471
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:26,535
If I open up...

472
00:48:26,634 --> 00:48:29,634
...can you make them get punished?

473
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,767
Yes, I promise.

474
00:48:42,701 --> 00:48:45,669
Why did your brother go
to the railroad at dawn?

475
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:51,834
Can you tell us what happened
to him before he died?

476
00:49:04,133 --> 00:49:08,266
As Mr. Park Bohyun was getting off work...

477
00:49:09,934 --> 00:49:11,735
...he told us to go to his house.

478
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:14,834
We didn't want to go.

479
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,600
But if we said no...

480
00:49:18,601 --> 00:49:19,634
...he will hit us.

481
00:50:23,634 --> 00:50:25,368
Minsu?

482
00:50:26,634 --> 00:50:28,268
He took off...

483
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:31,901
...my pants.

484
00:50:33,601 --> 00:50:34,668
Then...

485
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:38,701
...in my butt...

486
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,467
<i>Couldn't you resist or run away?</i>

487
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,534
If I tried...

488
00:50:48,334 --> 00:50:49,801
...he'd beat me all night.

489
00:50:51,267 --> 00:50:53,567
<i>Did it happen before, too?</i>

490
00:50:57,734 --> 00:50:59,335
At his house...

491
00:51:01,334 --> 00:51:03,668
...and the showers at the residence.

492
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:08,368
<i>My brother was so weak.</i>

493
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:11,401
...that after that happened...

494
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,467
...he couldn't walk from the pain.

495
00:51:21,968 --> 00:51:23,035
Inspector Jang?

496
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:24,700
What are you doing?

497
00:51:24,801 --> 00:51:29,468
You have the right to an attorney
and the right to remain silent.

498
00:51:29,834 --> 00:51:30,867
-Let's go.
-Hey.

499
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:33,868
You must've seen the TV show
but it's not true!

500
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,901
Think I could do such a thing?

501
00:51:37,434 --> 00:51:39,567
I'm the elder of Mujin Church.

502
00:51:39,801 --> 00:51:41,602
I'm a servant of Christ!

503
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,701
-You know that very well.
-Let me go, fools!

504
00:51:45,834 --> 00:51:47,768
I'm friends with the police chief!

505
00:51:47,868 --> 00:51:49,369
What's your name?

506
00:51:49,701 --> 00:51:53,502
-I'll have you all fired!
-Don't worry! It'll be okay!

507
00:51:53,567 --> 00:51:57,268
Those who framed you
will definitely pay for this!

508
00:51:57,334 --> 00:51:59,401
-What misfortune!
-Inspector Jang!

509
00:52:00,378 --> 00:52:02,345
You! Who do you think you are?

510
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,867
Just get int!

511
00:52:07,667 --> 00:52:08,601
Inspector Jang!

512
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,267
Don't you believe me?

513
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:13,600
How can you do this to us?

514
00:52:13,868 --> 00:52:16,068
After everything we gave you!

515
00:52:23,801 --> 00:52:26,934
Mujin Police Headquarters
flipped upside down.

516
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:30,834
Even prosecutors are
about to lose their jobs.

517
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:36,335
I won't say this twice.

518
00:52:36,467 --> 00:52:38,201
Stop whining and listen up.

519
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:42,901
Use all your connections and get
a lawyer who used to be a judge.

520
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:44,900
A chief prosecuting attorney at least.

521
00:52:45,133 --> 00:52:46,900
Someonf from Mujin would be better.

522
00:52:47,634 --> 00:52:51,701
Say crap like you didn't do it
and this accusation is upsetting.

523
00:52:52,167 --> 00:52:53,968
Before you find a lawyer...

524
00:52:54,133 --> 00:52:58,800
...I suggest you close your ears
and mouths like the kids.

525
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,634
You understand me?

526
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,835
Beloved citizens of Mujin.

527
00:53:09,267 --> 00:53:11,634
Elders, Lee Kangbok, and Kangsuk...

528
00:53:11,934 --> 00:53:15,401
...have worked hard for years....

529
00:53:15,467 --> 00:53:18,901
...for the development of
our church and Mujin.

530
00:53:20,501 --> 00:53:22,868
He served the God above...

531
00:53:22,968 --> 00:53:28,569
...and the poor disabled children below,
he devotes himself to voluntararily jobs.

532
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:34,334
Do not forgive those evil
forces who frame our elders!

533
00:53:34,367 --> 00:53:36,201
-It's a good thing.
-Everybody.

534
00:53:36,534 --> 00:53:38,667
I repeat!

535
00:53:38,868 --> 00:53:40,535
That the kids can't hear this.

536
00:53:42,267 --> 00:53:43,868
They've worked hard for years for...

537
00:53:43,934 --> 00:53:48,468
...for the development
of our church and Mujin.

538
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:51,502
He serves the God above...

539
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:54,534
Younghoon?

540
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,734
Did you find out anything
about their lawyer?

541
00:53:59,968 --> 00:54:03,502
Hwang Woosik is a very
famous attorney from Mujin.

542
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:06,435
He graduated magna cum laude
from Seoul Law School.

543
00:54:07,767 --> 00:54:11,067
He used to be a judge and recently
opened private practice.

544
00:54:11,534 --> 00:54:13,868
This is his first case.

545
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:15,235
Privileges of former post.

546
00:54:15,567 --> 00:54:16,867
What's that?

547
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,834
Retired judges are given a favorable
ruling at their first trial in practice.

548
00:54:38,634 --> 00:54:41,268
How can they be so alike?

549
00:54:41,434 --> 00:54:42,534
Their looks and their acts.

550
00:54:43,334 --> 00:54:46,534
For the last few days...

551
00:54:47,234 --> 00:54:49,068
...I trembled in shame.

552
00:54:49,734 --> 00:54:56,068
I thought about why God
gave me this adversity.

553
00:54:58,033 --> 00:55:02,400
Our father and teacher, Lee Junbum...

554
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:06,101
...had pity on the deaf.

555
00:55:06,567 --> 00:55:10,334
He used his entire fortune
to establish Ja Ae Academy...

556
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:12,301
...for the past 50 years ago.

557
00:55:12,701 --> 00:55:15,168
Since we were young...

558
00:55:15,534 --> 00:55:19,801
...our father taught us to care
for such young sheep.

559
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:23,333
We have never once forgot his teaching.

560
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:25,335
Interpretation, please!

561
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:27,135
Interpretation, please!

562
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:36,368
Order!

563
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:39,468
Order!

564
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:41,100
Your Honor.

565
00:55:41,801 --> 00:55:44,934
Deaf people here cannot hear you.

566
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,167
If you speak without permission,
I'll order you to leave the court.

567
00:55:53,501 --> 00:55:57,268
I'm Seo Yujin from 
Mujin Human Rights Center.

568
00:55:57,701 --> 00:56:01,202
This trial has to do with deaf people.

569
00:56:01,968 --> 00:56:05,535
Please bring in a 
sign language interpreter for them.

570
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,500
Ms. Seo is ordered to leave the court.

571
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:13,134
-Objection!
-What are you doing, guards?

572
00:56:13,234 --> 00:56:14,434
Escort her out of here!

573
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:17,135
I object! Your Honor!

574
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:18,801
Your Honor!

575
00:56:18,934 --> 00:56:20,568
I object, sir!

576
00:56:20,767 --> 00:56:23,735
It's only fair that a sign language
interpreter be here for this trial!

577
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:24,834
Let go!

578
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:26,601
From now on...

579
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:31,434
...anyone who disturbs this court will
be dealt with strictly by law.

580
00:56:32,234 --> 00:56:34,201
Defendant, please continue.

581
00:56:34,467 --> 00:56:36,634
We pray in Jesus' name.

582
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:38,035
-Amen.
-Amen.

583
00:56:54,534 --> 00:56:56,901
What? Sexual molestation?

584
00:56:57,601 --> 00:57:00,402
You filthy fools can
only see dirty things!

585
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:02,501
What are you doing?

586
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:05,634
How dare you little bitch!

587
00:57:05,667 --> 00:57:07,067
Who are you?

588
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:09,367
I'm Principal Lee's wife! So?

589
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:11,001
You devilish bitch.

590
00:57:11,234 --> 00:57:12,168
What are you doing?

591
00:57:12,267 --> 00:57:16,768
You wheedled kids to scam money
off my husband, didn't you?

592
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:17,535
Madam!

593
00:57:17,634 --> 00:57:20,401
-You got the wrong man, bitch!
-Why are you doing this?

594
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:21,500
Stop it! Let go!

595
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:23,768
You devilish bitch!

596
00:57:23,868 --> 00:57:27,369
Be gone Satan! Be gone!

597
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:33,567
She should be begging day and night
for God to forgive her husband.

598
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,767
You're such a kind person.

599
00:57:37,067 --> 00:57:40,200
She spits on you and all you
say is, "What are you doing?"?

600
00:57:41,901 --> 00:57:45,702
Can I stay at your office for a while?

601
00:57:46,033 --> 00:57:48,967
Why? Did you run away from home 
or something?

602
00:57:55,701 --> 00:57:56,868
You got fired?

603
00:57:57,968 --> 00:58:01,402
They can't fire you like that!

604
00:58:01,667 --> 00:58:03,501
Don't worry.

605
00:58:03,601 --> 00:58:06,502
I'll throw them in prison
and get you reinstated.

606
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,434
You must be happy.

607
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:12,234
Life's easy to you.

608
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:15,001
You got me all wrong.

609
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:18,135
My life's no peaches and cream.

610
00:58:18,934 --> 00:58:21,435
I have no time to date anyone
because of all the work I have to do.

611
00:58:21,534 --> 00:58:23,468
My grades are really bad
that I can't get another job.

612
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:26,800
With the tiny money I make...

613
00:58:39,234 --> 00:58:40,202
Inho.

614
00:58:43,067 --> 00:58:44,100
Do you regret it?

615
00:58:46,634 --> 00:58:47,968
Jumping into this case?

616
00:59:01,267 --> 00:59:04,567
How dd you know it's my pay day?

617
00:59:05,534 --> 00:59:07,201
I wired some money.

618
00:59:07,434 --> 00:59:08,734
Go check the bank.

619
00:59:12,901 --> 00:59:15,301
Yeah, everything's fine.

620
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,934
No, don't come over. I'm busy.

621
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,600
I got a lot of school work to do.

622
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,867
I'll visit some time soon.

623
00:59:29,467 --> 00:59:30,435
Bye.

624
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,367
I swear...

625
00:59:43,067 --> 00:59:48,467
...to tell the truth 
and nothing but the truth.

626
00:59:49,167 --> 00:59:53,868
I will be persecuted if I were
to provide false testimony.

627
00:59:54,434 --> 00:59:56,368
Witness, Oh Jungsik.

628
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,001
Counsel? Your witness.

629
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,200
Mr Oh Jungsik?

630
01:00:08,968 --> 01:00:12,135
What is your job title at Ja Ae Academy?

631
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:16,034
I'm the night guard at the school.

632
01:00:16,601 --> 01:00:17,801
How long have you worked there?

633
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:19,600
It's been five years.

634
01:00:20,667 --> 01:00:23,401
For the last five years...

635
01:00:24,901 --> 01:00:29,568
...you've worked under the defendants.
What is your impression of them?

636
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,301
They're both great men.

637
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,268
-They're always so thoughtful to me.
-Your Honor.

638
01:00:36,701 --> 01:00:39,701
Question is irrelevant to the trial.

639
01:00:39,901 --> 01:00:40,735
Sustained.

640
01:00:42,234 --> 01:00:44,102
Ask questions pertaining to the trial.

641
01:00:49,934 --> 01:00:52,601
You patrol the school every night?

642
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:55,368
I'll patrol the school 
once in three hours.

643
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:56,035
I see...

644
01:00:56,434 --> 01:00:57,768
Then, for the last five years...

645
01:00:57,868 --> 01:01:02,369
...have you ever seen the principal
or his brother call in children...

646
01:01:02,501 --> 01:01:06,634
...to their offices or drag them there?

647
01:01:06,801 --> 01:01:09,001
No, I haven't.

648
01:01:12,934 --> 01:01:15,868
Interpreter, please convey clearly.

649
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:17,901
Commotion is not tolerated.

650
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,767
On the night in question when
Yeongdu was sexually molested.

651
01:01:25,467 --> 01:01:28,834
You saw Kang Inho
outside the girl's bathroom?

652
01:01:30,634 --> 01:01:31,335
Yes.

653
01:01:31,434 --> 01:01:32,368
What did he say?

654
01:01:32,801 --> 01:01:36,502
He said he heard screams
from inside the bathroom.

655
01:01:36,701 --> 01:01:37,968
So, what did you do?

656
01:01:38,901 --> 01:01:40,769
He asked me to check.

657
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:45,101
So, I went in and looked.

658
01:01:46,534 --> 01:01:47,934
Was someone in there?

659
01:01:49,901 --> 01:01:52,835
No, no one.

660
01:01:55,167 --> 01:01:57,200
I see. No further questions.

661
01:02:01,234 --> 01:02:03,568
Please cross-examine prosecution.

662
01:02:07,934 --> 01:02:11,967
What did you do before working
at Ja Ae Academy?

663
01:02:12,934 --> 01:02:15,067
I was a janitor 
at Mujin Elementary School.

664
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:17,034
Then why'd you move to a special school?

665
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:20,535
The salary is much lower
than at a public school.

666
01:02:20,868 --> 01:02:21,602
Well...

667
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:23,468
While working at Mujin Elementary...

668
01:02:23,901 --> 01:02:25,769
...you were indicted for stealing....

669
01:02:25,901 --> 01:02:27,869
...and selling school supplies.
Is that right?

670
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:32,767
You were jobless for three years
because of that, weren't you?

671
01:02:32,834 --> 01:02:36,301
Your Honor, Prosecution's questioning
is irrelevant to this case.

672
01:02:36,367 --> 01:02:37,534
Objection!

673
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:42,701
The staff and teachers at the school
all have weak points.

674
01:02:42,934 --> 01:02:47,967
That's why the unfortunate events
were kept silent and hidden.

675
01:02:48,501 --> 01:02:52,668
This could be the main issue
pertaining this case.

676
01:02:52,734 --> 01:02:54,901
Sustained. Continue.

677
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,467
How did you come to work
at Ja Ae Academy?

678
01:02:59,367 --> 01:03:01,168
With your background, it
wouldn't have been easy.

679
01:03:01,601 --> 01:03:03,135
Someone introduced me ther.

680
01:03:03,234 --> 01:03:05,135
Exactly. Someone introduced you.

681
01:03:05,801 --> 01:03:09,335
You even paid them.

682
01:03:09,534 --> 01:03:11,868
If the school should
close due to this case...

683
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,634
...you have nowhere else to go, correct?

684
01:03:18,133 --> 01:03:19,001
No further questions.

685
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:24,600
You examined Jin Yuri when a human
rights center employee brought her?

686
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:25,702
Yes.

687
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:27,868
What was your diagnosis?

688
01:03:28,334 --> 01:03:33,302
Her vulva was inflamed
and her hymen was damaged.

689
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:36,201
Can a girl's hymen only be damaged...

690
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:38,700
...by sexual relations?

691
01:03:38,801 --> 01:03:41,402
No. It can be damaged by riding a bike...

692
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:43,335
As a gynaecologist, I'm sure that
you've seen...

693
01:03:43,434 --> 01:03:46,935
-...many sexually abused patients.
-Yes.

694
01:03:47,234 --> 01:03:49,768
What kind of state are they in?

695
01:03:50,434 --> 01:03:53,302
Usually, there are
severe lacerations to the vulva.

696
01:03:54,234 --> 01:03:58,234
And they are about to lose
their minds from humiliation.

697
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,300
How was Jin Yuri, when you first saw her?

698
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,500
She was calmly eating cookies.

699
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,300
Too calm for a girl who supposedly
got sexually molested.

700
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:12,967
There were no other
bruises or wounds either.

701
01:04:16,467 --> 01:04:21,435
So, she didn't seem like a child
who was sexually abused?

702
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,400
Yes...

703
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:24,635
No further questions.

704
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:30,667
That doctor is the head council
of Mujin High School alumnus.

705
01:04:32,133 --> 01:04:34,533
And she's the president.

706
01:04:37,534 --> 01:04:38,734
Your Honor.

707
01:04:40,767 --> 01:04:41,735
What is this?

708
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:44,401
This is the witness'
first diagnosis of Jin Yuri.

709
01:04:45,601 --> 01:04:48,668
This is your first diagnosis, correct?

710
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,634
Did you write your diagnosis twice?

711
01:04:54,901 --> 01:04:55,835
But...

712
01:04:56,067 --> 01:04:58,200
Answer yes or no.

713
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:01,601
Yes...

714
01:05:02,067 --> 01:05:06,935
The first diagnosis says the lacerations
to the vulva and damaged hymen...

715
01:05:07,133 --> 01:05:11,800
...are not suspected to be
from recent sexual relations.

716
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:19,134
The later diagnosis says it's not from
sexual relations but other causes.

717
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,367
In your second diagnosis...

718
01:05:21,467 --> 01:05:25,335
...you ruled out sexual relations.

719
01:05:26,067 --> 01:05:28,467
-Why did you rewrite your diagnosis?
-I...

720
01:05:29,834 --> 01:05:33,101
I didn't know this case was so serious.

721
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:36,701
Does a doctor's diagnosis
change depending on the case?

722
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:41,868
The first diagnosis said "not from
recent sexual relations," correct?

723
01:05:42,133 --> 01:05:42,734
Yes...

724
01:05:42,968 --> 01:05:46,435
Then you saw signs of
sexual relations from before, correct?

725
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:48,300
Witness.

726
01:05:48,534 --> 01:05:50,534
Why did you change your statement?

727
01:05:51,067 --> 01:05:53,267
Is it really because the case
got too serious?

728
01:05:53,634 --> 01:05:56,602
No. It's just that...

729
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:00,701
...her hymen wasn't damaged recently.

730
01:06:01,634 --> 01:06:05,901
It seemed to be about five years ago...

731
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,667
That makes her only 9 years old.

732
01:06:10,601 --> 01:06:14,001
-It's too young to have sex so...
-Please!

733
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:18,067
Is it possible for such a young girl and
a man to have sexual relations?

734
01:06:18,167 --> 01:06:19,901
Even if it was...

735
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:23,467
...without the girl's voluntary
consent, it's impossible!

736
01:06:28,534 --> 01:06:29,868
Order!

737
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,034
Order!

738
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:48,569
Minsu? It's not good?

739
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,001
Do you want something else?

740
01:06:55,801 --> 01:06:59,435
Yeondu, aren't you hungry?

741
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:38,133
I used to come to the beach
with my parents.

742
01:07:38,234 --> 01:07:44,401
Before I lost my hearing...

743
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:52,734
...I could hear the waves.

744
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:58,202
Now, it's too quiet.

745
01:08:02,267 --> 01:08:08,834
The most beautiful and precious
things in the world...

746
01:08:08,968 --> 01:08:14,168
...cannot be heard or seen.

747
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:21,300
But only felt by the heart.

748
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:30,135
Helen Keller said that.

749
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:33,433
It's my favorite quote.

750
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,500
What did she say?

751
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:05,001
She wishes I was her dad.

752
01:09:12,167 --> 01:09:13,567
And that you're her mom.

753
01:09:14,234 --> 01:09:15,301
Hey!

754
01:09:15,534 --> 01:09:17,601
He's a widower with a kid.

755
01:09:17,868 --> 01:09:20,369
I have never dated anyone yet.

756
01:09:20,634 --> 01:09:22,901
That's absolutely crazy.

757
01:09:23,501 --> 01:09:25,402
Don't even dream about it, okay?

758
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,067
What?

759
01:09:29,901 --> 01:09:31,469
Why aren't you answering?

760
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:33,168
Answer me right now!

761
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,468
Don't overreact.

762
01:09:36,033 --> 01:09:38,033
Tell her there's nothing between us.

763
01:09:38,234 --> 01:09:39,801
Alright, alright.

764
01:09:54,601 --> 01:09:56,502
First, I'll ask the defendants.

765
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:59,834
How do you feel upon seeing this child?

766
01:10:00,701 --> 01:10:02,368
Though it came to this...

767
01:10:02,567 --> 01:10:05,667
...she is still your student.

768
01:10:06,534 --> 01:10:10,934
I was curious to know
who started...

769
01:10:11,701 --> 01:10:13,435
...such ridiculous lies.

770
01:10:15,067 --> 01:10:16,734
Now, that I see her...

771
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:19,266
...I think I can remember her.

772
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:24,067
Are you saying that you don't even...

773
01:10:24,434 --> 01:10:26,434
...remember the girl you molested?

774
01:10:27,434 --> 01:10:30,668
I've seen her a few times.

775
01:10:31,267 --> 01:10:33,834
Principal Lee is right.

776
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:37,368
She even has a mental disability.

777
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:42,368
So, I remember feeling sorry and
patting her head a few times.

778
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:43,967
What about you?

779
01:10:46,033 --> 01:10:49,734
Of course I know her. She was in my class.

780
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:55,135
I loved her and cared for her a lot.

781
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,767
Which one...

782
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:05,168
...took off your clothes
and hurt you, Yuri?

783
01:11:16,267 --> 01:11:18,334
All three of them.

784
01:11:20,434 --> 01:11:21,901
How many times did it happen?

785
01:11:33,033 --> 01:11:34,066
A lot.

786
01:11:34,801 --> 01:11:36,001
Many times...

787
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,300
Can you remember when it started?

788
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,133
Since I was in grade 3.

789
01:11:50,767 --> 01:11:55,800
The chief gave me money
every time he hurt me.

790
01:11:56,434 --> 01:12:00,001
He gives me 1,000 won
to buy cookies.

791
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,001
He pulled off my pants.

792
01:12:04,701 --> 01:12:07,535
I said no because it hurts too much.

793
01:12:08,033 --> 01:12:10,166
I ran away because I was scared.

794
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:14,502
He grabbed me hard...

795
01:12:15,634 --> 01:12:17,268
...and forced me on a table.

796
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:20,468
He tied my hands...

797
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:24,667
...and feet to the table.

798
01:12:31,367 --> 01:12:33,301
That's all a lie!

799
01:12:33,501 --> 01:12:35,369
-She's crazy, Your Honor!
-He's right!

800
01:12:35,467 --> 01:12:37,467
-Don't believe her! 
-Stay quiet and be seated!

801
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,734
It's all a lie!

802
01:12:39,868 --> 01:12:41,736
-Stop lying!
-God knows the truth!

803
01:12:41,834 --> 01:12:43,601
-Order!
-Huh!

804
01:12:44,501 --> 01:12:45,968
Who told you to lie!

805
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,734
-Who put you up to this!
-Order!

806
01:12:50,133 --> 01:12:51,034
A settlement?

807
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:54,067
Why would there be a talk of settlement
when they molested children?

808
01:12:54,734 --> 01:12:59,801
The prosecutor said sexual
molestation to kids under 13...

809
01:13:00,267 --> 01:13:05,434
...can be annulled if they settle
with the victim's parents.

810
01:13:05,968 --> 01:13:09,302
What parent would settle
after what happened to their child?

811
01:13:11,968 --> 01:13:14,569
Yeondu doesn't have parents.

812
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:18,334
But Yuri and Minsu's parents
have mental disabilities.

813
01:13:19,167 --> 01:13:20,834
Damn bastards.

814
01:13:22,234 --> 01:13:25,168
They purposely chose kids who don't
have parents to take care of them.

815
01:13:27,133 --> 01:13:28,333
If Yuri...

816
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:32,367
...and Minsu's parents 
accept the settlement...

817
01:13:34,434 --> 01:13:35,668
The only thing...

818
01:13:36,567 --> 01:13:38,501
...which will be left is the Principal...

819
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:42,235
...sexually molesting Yeondu.

820
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:02,834
"Professor Kim"

821
01:14:17,634 --> 01:14:18,502
Professor!

822
01:14:28,868 --> 01:14:32,602
I'm sorry to ask you to meet so suddenly.

823
01:14:36,334 --> 01:14:39,434
It's fine, sir. I should've called you.

824
01:14:42,033 --> 01:14:45,267
I heard from Attorney Hwang.

825
01:14:46,734 --> 01:14:48,968
I'm the one who introduced
you to that school.

826
01:14:49,968 --> 01:14:52,435
It puts me in a tight spot.

827
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:55,200
I'm sorry, sir.

828
01:14:57,767 --> 01:14:59,900
No, don't be.

829
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:05,801
It's not good for you to be
caught up in this any longer.

830
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,600
It's the money you donated.

831
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,567
I added a little more.

832
01:15:23,434 --> 01:15:25,302
We hope you will help...

833
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,968
...in settling with Yeondu.

834
01:15:31,601 --> 01:15:33,435
Once everything's settled...

835
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:39,901
...we'll support Yeondu
untill she goes to college.

836
01:15:41,934 --> 01:15:44,768
And you should continue to draw.

837
01:15:45,801 --> 01:15:49,468
Your talent would be
a waste if you just stop drawing.

838
01:15:51,667 --> 01:15:55,901
I found a spot for you
at a school in Seoul.

839
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:59,600
You might have a hard time 
for the time being...

840
01:15:59,868 --> 01:16:04,235
...but they promised to hire you 
as full-time after a few semesters.

841
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,701
I'm sorry, Professor.

842
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:15,968
I have something to do,
so I'd better get going, sir.

843
01:16:20,334 --> 01:16:21,501
Mr. Kang?

844
01:16:24,234 --> 01:16:26,234
Think of your little daughter.

845
01:16:28,033 --> 01:16:31,200
I heard she's quite sick.

846
01:17:26,534 --> 01:17:28,934
The case is over.

847
01:17:30,133 --> 01:17:33,200
Yuri's relatives convinced her father
to accept the settlement.

848
01:17:36,033 --> 01:17:37,133
You know this, don't you

849
01:17:37,667 --> 01:17:41,067
<i>He's mentally disabled.</i>

850
01:17:56,133 --> 01:18:02,233
Are you sure you want to testify?

851
01:18:03,934 --> 01:18:05,268
I can do it.

852
01:18:11,234 --> 01:18:12,801
This is school?

853
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,701
You said you were too busy at school.

854
01:18:19,934 --> 01:18:21,368
Is this school work?

855
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:29,468
You think folks stay quiet because they
don't know what's right like you?

856
01:18:31,434 --> 01:18:35,135
If you want to take care
of yourself and family...

857
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:38,601
...you can't always just
do right and speak up.

858
01:18:41,934 --> 01:18:43,168
I have to go in.

859
01:18:48,534 --> 01:18:49,502
You!

860
01:18:51,634 --> 01:18:54,934
Is she more important to you than Sol?

861
01:19:06,634 --> 01:19:08,401
I was there...

862
01:19:09,367 --> 01:19:10,767
...when she was being abused.

863
01:19:13,534 --> 01:19:14,567
But...

864
01:19:17,701 --> 01:19:19,202
...I did nothing.

865
01:19:20,968 --> 01:19:22,735
If I let go of her hand now...

866
01:19:25,033 --> 01:19:28,734
...I don't think I can be
a good father to Sol, either.

867
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:33,401
Kim Yeondu.

868
01:19:34,868 --> 01:19:40,302
You said the principal sexually
molested you, correct?

869
01:19:43,567 --> 01:19:44,834
Yes, that's right.

870
01:19:45,968 --> 01:19:49,702
Did you see the principal often?

871
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,168
No.

872
01:19:53,667 --> 01:19:58,201
Then, how do you know the principal
sexually abused you?

873
01:20:00,601 --> 01:20:03,035
I saw him a few times at school.

874
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:06,134
And he dragged me to
the principal's office that night.

875
01:20:07,067 --> 01:20:10,401
Then out of those two men...

876
01:20:12,501 --> 01:20:14,068
...which one is the principal?

877
01:20:23,133 --> 01:20:24,233
Objection!

878
01:20:24,734 --> 01:20:28,934
Asking the witness to verify the
defendants now is meaningless.

879
01:20:29,067 --> 01:20:30,801
It's a very important question!

880
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,767
Claiming that the principal...

881
01:20:34,934 --> 01:20:37,334
...molested the victim is circumstantial.

882
01:20:37,601 --> 01:20:42,168
The principal's twin brother
could've committed the crime.

883
01:20:43,968 --> 01:20:48,302
That means Principal Lee Kangsuk
is not guilty of the charges.

884
01:20:50,801 --> 01:20:53,201
Sustained. Continue.

885
01:20:56,734 --> 01:20:59,968
Which one sexually molested you?

886
01:21:10,534 --> 01:21:14,368
Your Honor, she'd like to
go up closer to look.

887
01:21:15,167 --> 01:21:16,101
Granted.

888
01:21:52,734 --> 01:21:54,568
Defendant 4022.

889
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,135
He is defendant Lee Kangsuk.

890
01:21:58,734 --> 01:22:01,867
But, how did you know?

891
01:22:02,801 --> 01:22:05,568
How can you tell the difference?

892
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:10,233
They both cannot do sign language.

893
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:16,034
But, when the principal dragged
me to the bathroom or hurt Yuri...

894
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:18,001
...he'd say one thing in sign language.

895
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,601
What's that?

896
01:22:20,801 --> 01:22:23,834
If you tell anyone else, I'll kill you.

897
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:29,901
When I did the sign language,
one understood and grimaced.

898
01:22:32,667 --> 01:22:36,834
So, this man is the principal.

899
01:22:48,968 --> 01:22:49,802
Yeondu.

900
01:22:50,367 --> 01:22:54,068
According to your
testimony of that night...

901
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:59,433
...you realized that Yuri was missing when
coming back from buying cup <i>ramyeon</i>.

902
01:23:01,367 --> 01:23:06,834
Then, you said you saw Yuri get
molested in the principal's office.

903
01:23:07,367 --> 01:23:08,335
Is that correct?

904
01:23:10,601 --> 01:23:12,734
Yes, that's right.

905
01:23:13,667 --> 01:23:16,568
You said you were heading
to the residence...

906
01:23:16,634 --> 01:23:19,934
...when you heard faint music
from the principal's office...

907
01:23:21,267 --> 01:23:22,801
...so you went there, correct?

908
01:23:25,901 --> 01:23:26,735
Yes.

909
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:34,167
Your Honor, that's just it.

910
01:23:34,634 --> 01:23:36,235
Faint sound of music.

911
01:23:37,801 --> 01:23:40,068
Yeondu is deaf.

912
01:23:40,267 --> 01:23:42,434
How can she hear music?

913
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:45,667
She claims she followed the music.

914
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:50,867
Then she found the principal
sexually molesting her friend.

915
01:23:52,567 --> 01:23:56,301
Your Honor, how absurd is that?

916
01:23:56,534 --> 01:23:59,534
-Making up such ridiculous lies to...
-It's not a lie.

917
01:24:02,868 --> 01:24:05,835
I definitely heard
a faint sound of music.

918
01:24:07,133 --> 01:24:08,900
It's a song by Cho Sungmo.

919
01:24:10,734 --> 01:24:11,834
Witness?

920
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:14,367
You said you'd lost hearing.

921
01:24:15,334 --> 01:24:17,634
But you still heard music?

922
01:24:21,234 --> 01:24:22,035
Yes.

923
01:24:23,467 --> 01:24:24,500
Yeondu?

924
01:24:25,501 --> 01:24:30,068
We will test to see if you
can really hear music.

925
01:24:30,634 --> 01:24:33,301
Raise your hand when you hear the music.

926
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,267
Let's begin.

927
01:26:55,234 --> 01:26:57,234
I accept the witness' account.

928
01:26:57,901 --> 01:27:03,802
Prosecutor, submit an expert diagnosis
of Yeondu's auditory state.

929
01:27:04,868 --> 01:27:06,968
The court will be back
in session on Friday.

930
01:27:07,467 --> 01:27:11,268
Notify me of any further witnesses.

931
01:27:53,467 --> 01:27:57,301
How can adults do
that to these poor children?

932
01:27:59,734 --> 01:28:02,068
Come back as soon as this is done.

933
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:39,001
What brings you here?

934
01:28:44,067 --> 01:28:45,634
You must have sensed something.

935
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,734
Yup, this is it.

936
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:53,469
A signed settlement.

937
01:28:54,701 --> 01:28:59,135
Minsu's grandmother saw
the money and signed right away.

938
01:29:02,501 --> 01:29:03,768
This is so funny.

939
01:29:04,834 --> 01:29:07,768
Though she's poor and uneducated...

940
01:29:08,267 --> 01:29:11,201
Her grandsons went through all that...

941
01:29:11,634 --> 01:29:13,934
...and she signs over a few lousy bucks?

942
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:19,534
Well, it's understandable.

943
01:29:20,834 --> 01:29:24,668
Her only son is sick in bed like a corpse.

944
01:29:25,534 --> 01:29:27,801
Her daughter-in-law ran away.

945
01:29:28,868 --> 01:29:30,868
And her grandsons are...

946
01:29:31,868 --> 01:29:34,435
...mute and deaf.

947
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,200
At times like this...

948
01:29:39,701 --> 01:29:42,768
...I think that God is being so unfair.

949
01:30:15,234 --> 01:30:21,668
Can I look at this while I testify?

950
01:30:24,767 --> 01:30:29,501
I want to do a good job
like Yeondu, but I'm not sure.

951
01:30:32,901 --> 01:30:38,769
So, I wrote it all down her about what 
Mr Park did to my brother and me...

952
01:30:38,868 --> 01:30:40,135
Minsu...

953
01:30:42,467 --> 01:30:47,268
About you testifying...

954
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,368
It's been cancelled.

955
01:30:55,133 --> 01:30:57,001
But why?

956
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:07,535
Your grandmother forgave him.

957
01:31:12,834 --> 01:31:17,134
They begged for forgiveness.

958
01:31:20,968 --> 01:31:24,168
Your grandmother is a good person.

959
01:31:42,734 --> 01:31:45,068
He killed my brother!

960
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:50,067
He hit us and pulled our pants down 
whenever he could!

961
01:31:51,167 --> 01:31:52,300
Minsu.

962
01:31:55,834 --> 01:31:58,901
Who forgave him? I didn't forgive him!

963
01:31:59,067 --> 01:32:02,100
He didn't beg forgiveness
to me and my brother!

964
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,801
How can he be forgiven!

965
01:32:06,567 --> 01:32:10,535
You promised they'd get punished!

966
01:32:10,801 --> 01:32:13,468
You promised! You promised!

967
01:32:22,133 --> 01:32:23,266
I'm sorry, Minsu.

968
01:32:29,334 --> 01:32:30,568
I'm so sorry, Minsu.

969
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:04,300
Yeondu?

970
01:33:12,534 --> 01:33:13,268
What is it?

971
01:33:14,467 --> 01:33:17,435
I have something to tell you.

972
01:33:18,934 --> 01:33:20,301
What?

973
01:33:20,734 --> 01:33:25,034
There's something I didn't mention.

974
01:33:27,367 --> 01:33:34,101
When I was dragged to the office...

975
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:38,267
...and saw the scene on the TV...

976
01:33:38,367 --> 01:33:44,400
About the naked man and girl on TV.

977
01:33:44,601 --> 01:33:49,068
I'm not sure...

978
01:33:49,167 --> 01:33:52,734
But I think he's...

979
01:33:56,634 --> 01:33:58,535
You think there really
is something like that?

980
01:33:59,234 --> 01:34:03,367
It might've been there but I don't
think he'd just elave it over there.

981
01:34:04,467 --> 01:34:06,667
The principal was arrested
suddenly that day.

982
01:34:06,868 --> 01:34:08,635
He must've been too shocked
to even do anything.

983
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,100
What if he asked someone
to get rid of it?

984
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,534
Who? His wife?

985
01:34:14,367 --> 01:34:18,434
So, he can tell her, who worships him
like Jesus, that he's a pervert?

986
01:34:18,634 --> 01:34:20,701
Or tell his lover Yoon Ja Ae?

987
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:22,100
True.

988
01:34:22,634 --> 01:34:25,468
She would've tossed him right
into the laundry machine.

989
01:34:46,634 --> 01:34:48,934
Such bullshit.

990
01:35:48,033 --> 01:35:51,600
The date on the tape is the same
as the date Yeondu claims.

991
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,801
You said this before.

992
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,400
Cases involving kids who are 13 years and
above can be solved with a settlement.

993
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,767
But the date is March 14th.
That's before Yuri's 13th birthday.

994
01:36:01,868 --> 01:36:06,168
That's right. Those who sexually abused
children under 13 may be punished...

995
01:36:06,868 --> 01:36:08,836
...regardless of a settlement.

996
01:36:08,934 --> 01:36:12,234
And with definite evidence...

997
01:36:12,868 --> 01:36:16,668
...even their attorney won't
be able to do anything about it.

998
01:36:16,934 --> 01:36:18,701
Not many days are leftuntil the verdict.

999
01:36:18,801 --> 01:36:20,502
Is it possible to have another trial?

1000
01:36:20,567 --> 01:36:25,068
Still, we can't show this
as evidence in open court.

1001
01:36:25,334 --> 01:36:27,334
Then what sould we do?

1002
01:36:27,434 --> 01:36:32,501
Don't worry. I'll take this
evidence to the judge directly.

1003
01:36:57,167 --> 01:37:00,334
"Liberty, equality, justice"

1004
01:37:03,634 --> 01:37:04,968
Defendants.

1005
01:37:05,634 --> 01:37:08,634
As teachers of a school
for deaf children...

1006
01:37:09,067 --> 01:37:14,901
...sexually molesting young
students is a terrible crime.

1007
01:37:15,467 --> 01:37:21,134
You have the social responsibility
to protect the children.

1008
01:37:21,801 --> 01:37:28,101
But you sexually molested and abused them.

1009
01:37:28,267 --> 01:37:30,168
Therefore, 
you should be severely punished.

1010
01:37:32,968 --> 01:37:34,068
However...

1011
01:37:34,634 --> 01:37:38,168
...they have allowed for great
to the development of society...

1012
01:37:38,501 --> 01:37:40,402
...and have no prior criminal record.

1013
01:37:40,968 --> 01:37:45,769
Also, the guardians of Jin Yuri 
and Jeon Minsu...

1014
01:37:45,868 --> 01:37:47,935
...have agreed fro a settlement
with the defendants.

1015
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:52,534
Considering how well
their children were taken care of...

1016
01:37:53,133 --> 01:37:56,467
...they wrote petitions
for lenient sentences.

1017
01:37:56,901 --> 01:37:58,769
Thefore, I give the following sentences.

1018
01:38:00,534 --> 01:38:02,801
Defendant Park Bohyun.

1019
01:38:03,367 --> 01:38:06,201
8 months imprisonment
and 2 year probation.

1020
01:38:09,367 --> 01:38:11,335
Defendant Lee Kangbok.

1021
01:38:11,968 --> 01:38:15,035
6 months imprisonment
and 1 year probation.

1022
01:38:16,267 --> 01:38:18,201
Defendant Lee Kangsuk.

1023
01:38:19,033 --> 01:38:22,400
6 months imprisonment
and 1 year probation.

1024
01:38:22,901 --> 01:38:26,034
Prosecutors should immediately take 
necessary steps...

1025
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:29,934
...for the defendants' release.

1026
01:41:20,167 --> 01:41:21,300
I'm sorry.

1027
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:24,667
For being unable to help till the end.

1028
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:29,967
See the kids before you go.

1029
01:41:39,734 --> 01:41:43,235
I should thank that judge.

1030
01:41:43,334 --> 01:41:47,935
No need. That's not necessary. 
Privilege of former post is a given.

1031
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:53,967
I'll buy him a drink sometime myself.

1032
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:57,834
By the way...

1033
01:41:58,267 --> 01:42:01,501
...how did you win over that prosecutor?

1034
01:42:01,601 --> 01:42:06,901
He's been circling the countryside
with no career advancement.

1035
01:42:07,033 --> 01:42:11,600
Basically, he hit rock bottom 
with nowhere to go.

1036
01:42:14,367 --> 01:42:18,268
He was ecstatic when I said
I'll take him in my law firm.

1037
01:42:25,334 --> 01:42:27,168
What's wrong? Are you hungry?

1038
01:42:48,601 --> 01:42:50,068
<i>Suh Yujin</i>

1039
01:42:50,167 --> 01:42:53,300
Minsu went to Park Bohyun's place
to get revenge.

1040
01:42:53,767 --> 01:42:55,534
<i>I'm going to his house right now.</i>

1041
01:42:55,634 --> 01:42:56,868
Please hurry over.

1042
01:42:58,901 --> 01:43:00,402
Are you listening?

1043
01:43:28,067 --> 01:43:29,367
It's you, Minsu.

1044
01:43:35,067 --> 01:43:36,968
Are you here because you missed me?

1045
01:43:38,767 --> 01:43:41,501
You're soaked from the rain.

1046
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,033
Let's go in and wash up.

1047
01:43:47,567 --> 01:43:48,334
Okay?

1048
01:43:59,667 --> 01:44:01,734
Minsu!

1049
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:03,133
Minsu!

1050
01:44:03,267 --> 01:44:04,868
Is anyone there?

1051
01:44:05,667 --> 01:44:06,734
Minsu!

1052
01:44:07,267 --> 01:44:08,235
Minsu!

1053
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,434
Damn this hurts.

1054
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,734
Shit!

1055
01:44:42,501 --> 01:44:43,668
Minsu!

1056
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,100
Minsu!

1057
01:44:51,434 --> 01:44:52,634
Minsu!

1058
01:45:00,267 --> 01:45:02,567
How can you do this to me?!

1059
01:45:12,968 --> 01:45:13,869
Minsu!

1060
01:46:16,834 --> 01:46:21,268
<i>This is an announcement
from the Mujin Police.</i>

1061
01:46:21,534 --> 01:46:27,968
<i>Your demonstration is in direct
violation of Article 6 Section 1.</i>

1062
01:46:28,801 --> 01:46:32,801
<i>You are illegally blocking the roads...</i>

1063
01:46:33,067 --> 01:46:36,334
<i>...and disrupting peace.</i>

1064
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:39,734
<i>Please disperse at once.</i>

1065
01:46:43,834 --> 01:46:50,134
You are holding an illegal rally.

1066
01:46:50,567 --> 01:46:52,368
Please disperse at once.

1067
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:54,667
I repeat.

1068
01:46:56,033 --> 01:46:57,700
You are occupying...

1069
01:46:57,968 --> 01:47:00,402
...the street illegally.

1070
01:47:01,033 --> 01:47:02,834
If you don't disperse at once...

1071
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:06,467
...you will be charged
with traffic violations...

1072
01:47:10,100 --> 01:47:11,367
Shit.

1073
01:47:13,067 --> 01:47:14,401
They can't hear.

1074
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:49,567
Hurry up and shoot!

1075
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:01,367
This boy...

1076
01:49:03,501 --> 01:49:07,302
...cannot hear or speak.

1077
01:49:09,901 --> 01:49:11,201
This child's name is...

1078
01:49:12,901 --> 01:49:14,268
...Minsu.

1079
01:49:16,901 --> 01:49:18,101
He can neither hear...

1080
01:49:19,033 --> 01:49:20,901
...nor speak.

1081
01:49:22,667 --> 01:49:24,568
This boy's name is...

1082
01:49:25,968 --> 01:49:27,435
...Minsu.

1083
01:49:29,434 --> 01:49:30,634
He can neither hear...

1084
01:49:33,033 --> 01:49:34,500
...nor speak.

1085
01:49:38,834 --> 01:49:39,967
Please.

1086
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:42,733
His name is...

1087
01:49:43,667 --> 01:49:45,101
...Minsu.

1088
01:49:46,767 --> 01:49:50,434
He can neither hear nor speak.

1089
01:49:51,868 --> 01:49:54,202
This boy is...

1090
01:49:55,467 --> 01:49:56,834
...Minsu.

1091
01:50:01,234 --> 01:50:02,367
This boy is...

1092
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:03,901
...Minsu.

1093
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:27,934
<i>How are you doing, Inho?</i>

1094
01:51:29,367 --> 01:51:32,201
<i>Sorry I haven't called in a long time.</i>

1095
01:51:33,501 --> 01:51:35,501
<i>A lot has happened since then.</i>

1096
01:51:36,334 --> 01:51:40,035
<i>Some are good, some are bad.</i>

1097
01:51:41,868 --> 01:51:43,868
<i>I'll start with the bad news first.</i>

1098
01:51:44,567 --> 01:51:46,600
<i>Our appeal was rejected.</i>

1099
01:51:47,734 --> 01:51:50,767
<i>The settlement was the problem.</i>

1100
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,300
<i>The good news is...</i>

1101
01:51:53,734 --> 01:51:56,468
<i>...there are people who
help these kids now.</i>

1102
01:51:57,033 --> 01:52:00,834
<i>The kids who quit Ja Ae Academy
now have a place to stay.</i>

1103
01:52:01,634 --> 01:52:04,301
<i>Some volunteers cook meals for them.</i>

1104
01:52:05,567 --> 01:52:07,801
<i>Yuri is receiving psychological help...</i>

1105
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,868
<i>...and has gotten much healthier.</i>

1106
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:14,500
<i>She's even teaching me
sign language these days.</i>

1107
01:52:15,767 --> 01:52:18,234
<i>Yeondu says she wants
to become an art teacher.</i>

1108
01:52:18,334 --> 01:52:19,901
Merry Christma!

1109
01:52:21,234 --> 01:52:25,334
<i>She wants to help sick children like you.</i>

1110
01:52:27,767 --> 01:52:31,034
<i>I asked Yuri and Yeondu this 
during a meal.</i>

1111
01:52:32,267 --> 01:52:38,068
<i>What changed the most before
and after this whole thing?</i>

1112
01:52:39,567 --> 01:52:41,401
<i>Do you know what they said?</i>

1113
01:52:42,534 --> 01:52:47,834
<i>They realized they're precious
just like everyone else.</i>

1114
01:52:49,701 --> 01:52:54,268
<i>Watching them grow so well,
it makes me think...</i>

1115
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,767
<i>...that we should not fight...</i>

1116
01:52:58,300 --> 01:53:00,400
<i>...to change the world.</i>

1117
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:05,500
<i>But it's to stop it 
from changing who we are.</i>

1118
01:53:08,367 --> 01:53:10,567
<i>The weather got very cold.</i>

1119
01:53:11,534 --> 01:53:13,068
<i>Winter is cold...</i>

1120
01:53:13,567 --> 01:53:18,634
<i>...so that we can feel the precious
warmth of those around us.</i>

1121
01:53:20,067 --> 01:53:21,868
<i>Though we're not with you...</i>

1122
01:53:22,968 --> 01:53:24,836
<i>...I'll pray...</i>

1123
01:53:25,167 --> 01:53:29,300
<i>...that you'll feel the warmth of us 
around you.</i>

1124
01:53:51,077 --> 01:54:08,777
"Please come to Mujin,
the city of the white fog"
