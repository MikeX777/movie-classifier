00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:28,696
This story was inspired
by true events that took place

3
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,742
in the Guajira region (northern Colombia),
between the decades of 1960 and 1980.

4
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:20,330
...the family,
the grandmother, the mother...

5
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:25,253
...the uncle, the nephew, the grandson...

6
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,506
are represented in the hand's fingers,

7
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:32,427
so that the Wayuu won't forget his origin.

8
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,846
If there's family,

9
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:37,890
there's respect.

10
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:39,809
If there's respect,

11
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,561
there's honor.

12
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,229
If there's honor,

13
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:44,772
there's word.

14
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:46,316
If there's word,

15
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,693
there's peace.

16
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,653
Look at me, Zaida.

17
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:58,536
You have fulfilled your year
in confinement with dignity and grace.

18
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,833
When you go out, you'll be a woman.
You must be aware of the signs.

19
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,336
Use them to protect your family.

20
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,464
Come here, Zaida.

21
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,387
The core of the family...

22
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,475
The grandmother...

23
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:23,144
The mother...

24
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,396
The nephew...

25
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,482
The uncle...

26
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:41,411
I am the shepherd,
the shepherd who sings jayeechis.

27
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:45,207
I've sung to bid farewell to the dead
and to remember the wars of the past.

28
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:49,211
To bring the winds
and recount stories of love.

29
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,006
My memory has started to fade and with it,

30
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,884
all the tales and stories that I've sung.

31
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:59,429
Before my footprints are erased,
with my singing I want to remember

32
00:02:59,931 --> 00:03:02,475
the story of love,
desolation, wealth and pain

33
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,853
of that great family
that destroyed itself.

34
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,731
It is first the story of Rapayet,
who came from a lineage of warriors.

35
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,235
He lost everyone when he was a boy
and grew among foreigners

36
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:17,197
in this place where family
means everything.

37
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:47,269
Don't cry. Don't be afraid.

38
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,232
I'll be by your side.

39
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,655
Let's go.

40
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,174
I thought you weren't coming, uncle.

41
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,426
What did you bring?

42
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,928
A tuma necklace.

43
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,608
Come out, daughter.

44
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,814
I present you with my work.

45
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:32,417
Let's have a great feast now that my niece
Zaida has become a woman!

46
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,109
I want to dance the Yonna with you, too.

47
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,808
Who is he?

48
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,434
Rapayet, Peregrino's nephew.

49
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:16,144
Uliana?

50
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,481
Abuchaibe Uliana.

51
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,308
You are my woman.

52
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:13,620
Rapayet, you should've brought a goat.

53
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,955
Necklaces aren't appropriate.

54
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,919
If they accept you,
you'll have to work hard.

55
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:23,630
I got new customers for you.

56
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,424
The dowry is going to be expensive.

57
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:29,176
I'll get it, uncle.

58
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,058
Be honest when you speak to her mother.

59
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:39,812
Don't hide the situation you're in.

60
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,649
She's the one you have to persuade.

61
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:49,614
You have to convince her
that you'll put your family above all.

62
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,659
Even above your businesses
with alijunas, nephew.

63
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:59,499
Your deeds
will have to back up your words.

64
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:34,616
She was barefooted, she had a blanket.

65
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:40,164
Did she see you? Did you see her face?

66
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,920
I can't remember,
but she spoke to me in Spanish.

67
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:52,051
Your grandmother is showing us the way.

68
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,511
It's a dead end, straight into the sea.

69
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,266
It's calm now, but it can be turbulent.

70
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:09,068
Someone needs our help,
but they can also bring us pain.

71
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:17,409
I don't want to dream anymore.

72
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:22,290
Dreams prove the existence of the soul.

73
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,002
Don't be scared.

74
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,759
Death comes and goes.
We have to be alert.

75
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:36,471
You've always known
how to talk to the dream.

76
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,805
You did good in ending the confinement.

77
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:41,893
We must listen
to what your grandmother is telling us.

78
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:44,938
Let's hope death won't show up again.

79
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,584
If you want to have a family,
you'll have to follow our traditions.

80
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:09,504
I know.

81
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,591
Necklaces are very personal items,
they're used as protection,

82
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,550
and are given in a different occasion.

83
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:18,095
You should've brought a goat.

84
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,563
Friends.

85
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,150
Have you eaten and slept well?

86
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:36,488
As always. It's a celebration
worthy of the Pushaina family.

87
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:50,377
Last time I came,
you had half the animals.

88
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:53,380
We've had a lot of rain.

89
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,968
My ranch has been blessed by Juyá.

90
00:11:57,385 --> 00:12:03,099
You've also known
how to handle business with alijunas.

91
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:07,269
Úrsula is known for her trading skills
around the province.

92
00:12:09,856 --> 00:12:14,693
Today, I come as word messenger
to my nephew, Rapayet Abuchaibe Uliana.

93
00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:21,200
He's the son
of my deceased cousin, Chay Uliana.

94
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:24,995
Rapayet wants to marry Zaida.

95
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,499
He's a suitor you should consider.

96
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:32,629
Peregrino, you're one of the most
respected word messengers there are.

97
00:12:32,712 --> 00:12:34,797
We'll listen to you, but my sister Úrsula

98
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,384
is one of the most prestigious
Wayuus in the Wajira.

99
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:42,137
Her daughter deserves
a better family than Rapayet's.

100
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,683
His family had great prestige once.

101
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,687
Most of them died in a dispute,
but that conflict was resolved with honor.

102
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:53,691
Rapayet not only forged
a path for himself without help,

103
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,903
but he established a relationship
with the alijunas,

104
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:58,862
that opened the world to him.

105
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,322
He's a great businessman,

106
00:13:00,365 --> 00:13:02,909
and his respect for traditions
is an example to be followed.

107
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,077
He'll make your family's prestige grow.

108
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,002
Do you speak Spanish, Rapayet?

109
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,630
Yes, but I prefer to speak wayuunaiki.

110
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:31,771
For the dowry, we are requesting
30 goats, 20 cows, five necklaces,

111
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:36,275
two of them made
from mountain tuma stones

112
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:37,860
and two decorative mules.

113
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:41,197
That's the dowry
if you want to marry Zaida.

114
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,919
Do you know why I'm respected?

115
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:01,759
Because you know how to treat alijunas.
And you can talk to the dreams.

116
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,468
No.

117
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,182
Because I'm capable of anything
for my family and my clan.

118
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:17,065
This is our family's talisman.

119
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:20,570
I guard it.

120
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:26,159
From plagues and people trying to fool us.

121
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,661
Even if you get the dowry,
the spirits will warn me about you.

122
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:46,553
BIRDS OF PASSAGE

123
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:04,905
SONG I
WILD GRASS

124
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,480
- Have you been waiting long?
- A while.

125
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:21,315
Are you Peregrino's nephew?

126
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,067
Yes.

127
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,736
Did you bring all the merchandise?

128
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,492
One, two, three...

129
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:47,383
Are you going somewhere?

130
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,390
My ride is here.

131
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:57,434
Give my regards to your uncle.

132
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,645
Gladly.

133
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,808
Count it, Moncho.

134
00:17:44,357 --> 00:17:45,858
We'll lose all our costumers that way.

135
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,652
To women, my friend.

136
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,154
The most beautiful thing.

137
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:53,908
We have an early start, Moncho.

138
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:58,996
We need to go get the coffee, tomorrow.

139
00:18:14,012 --> 00:18:15,013
Hi, César.

140
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:16,472
How's it going, Rafa?

141
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:18,515
All good.

142
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:15,322
Those Americans over there
are from something called the Peace Corps.

143
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:18,034
They say they're rallying
against Communism,

144
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:20,870
but what they're desperately trying
to find is marijuana.

145
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:23,956
Do you have any to sell them?

146
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:26,041
No.

147
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:44,893
Moncho, I have no more money.

148
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,520
Take it easy.

149
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,856
It's on me. We made some money
today.

150
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,571
Hi, César.

151
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,366
Two packs of cigarettes, please.

152
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:05,915
- Twenty pesos.
- Like this?

153
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,834
Have you found what I'm looking
for?

154
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,169
No.

155
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,215
Hey!

156
00:20:23,474 --> 00:20:24,225
César.

157
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,727
When are the gringos leaving?

158
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:27,853
I don't know.

159
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,443
We can get them the marijuana
they're looking for, Moncho.

160
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:34,818
Is that so?

161
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:36,696
Where are you hiding it?

162
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,822
Underneath that little skirt
you wear?

163
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,493
Introduce me, César.

164
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,084
Hi, Peter. I think I found
what you’re looking for.

165
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,591
Bill is going to be happy with
this.

166
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,550
Thank you.

167
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:00,553
- See you soon.
- Ok, Peter.

168
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,391
Remember, say no to Communism.

169
00:21:08,268 --> 00:21:09,895
No Communism, Peter.

170
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:12,774
Long live Capitalism!

171
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:18,862
Are you crazy?

172
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:21,823
Where will we find 50 kilos?

173
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,118
Two hundred pesos a pound.

174
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,411
We couldn't have done the deal
for less.

175
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,288
How are we gonna pay?

176
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:33,795
We're gonna reinvest
the money from the coffee.

177
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,381
Long live Capitalism, my friend.

178
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,102
- Straight ahead?
- Yes.

179
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,420
It's all I have.

180
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:25,554
He wants to be paid more.

181
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,727
Tell him we'll pay him when we
get back.

182
00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:35,314
We'll pay you when we come back.

183
00:22:35,398 --> 00:22:36,815
In his language.

184
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,651
Do you think we speak the same
language?

185
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,537
This is worth more
than your donkey ride.

186
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:14,562
Calm down!

187
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:34,582
Who are you?

188
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:41,214
Gabriel.

189
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:43,173
Take it easy, cousin.

190
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,260
Rapayet.

191
00:23:48,137 --> 00:23:49,013
Rapayet?

192
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:51,349
Cousin Rapayet.

193
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,226
Long time, no see!

194
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,977
Come in.

195
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:44,319
I thought the Sierra was not
a place worthy of a Wayuu.

196
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,489
This is my friend Moisés.

197
00:24:50,073 --> 00:24:51,909
We brought you a goat.

198
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,873
Why are you still speaking indian?
We're not in the desert.

199
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:05,297
Mérida.

200
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,717
Offer them something to drink.

201
00:25:20,438 --> 00:25:22,814
How much for a pound of coffee?

202
00:25:23,274 --> 00:25:24,274
Twelve?

203
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:26,944
I'll give you 50 for the weed.

204
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:29,072
It's a great business, cousin.

205
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,074
It'll be good for both families.

206
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,996
Give me 60.

207
00:25:45,088 --> 00:25:47,173
I don't do business with
alijunas.

208
00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:56,099
You're negotiating with me,
cousin.

209
00:25:56,724 --> 00:25:58,351
Help me get the dowry.

210
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:28,297
But Aníbal, how much ointment
are you going to make?

211
00:26:33,844 --> 00:26:35,596
Your cousins are a riot.

212
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:55,490
Victoria.

213
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:57,200
Rapayet.

214
00:27:06,002 --> 00:27:08,046
My contribution, for the dowry.

215
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:18,555
Thank you, cousin.

216
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:34,822
See you, partner.

217
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:05,852
I didn't think they would get
it.

218
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:08,147
Yes, mister.

219
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:09,815
Here we are.

220
00:28:10,524 --> 00:28:11,734
We bring you joy.

221
00:28:14,445 --> 00:28:15,655
Did you get the money?

222
00:28:16,406 --> 00:28:17,447
Of course.

223
00:28:17,782 --> 00:28:18,908
Do you want to take a look?

224
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:51,690
I'll go get the money.

225
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,114
Look at them, Rafa.

226
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:43,368
This is a fantastic business.

227
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:46,955
Weed is the world's happiness.

228
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,581
Their happiness.

229
00:30:01,052 --> 00:30:02,219
Hey. What's up?

230
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:03,595
My name is Bill.

231
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:07,140
We work in the exports business.

232
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:10,185
I am very interested
in this product of yours.

233
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:12,313
Can we talk about it?
May I sit down?

234
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:13,523
Of course.

235
00:31:17,711 --> 00:31:19,546
What are you doing, Rapayet?

236
00:31:21,674 --> 00:31:23,217
I brought the dowry.

237
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:26,763
Did you bring the necklaces?

238
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:38,815
Where did you get all this?

239
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:42,402
I'm in business with the
gringos.

240
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:48,868
Being among alijunas has made
you forget about our traditions.

241
00:31:50,578 --> 00:31:53,498
You have to send word
before delivering the dowry.

242
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:56,458
Go get Peregrino.

243
00:31:57,293 --> 00:31:59,544
Or you will unleash the
spirits' fury.

244
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:40,127
Wayúu, you are now sharing a hammock.
Your path is joyful and simple.

245
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:46,342
Úrsula has taken you into her family,
you are with the Pushainas now.

246
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:50,804
You'll have to prove yourself.

247
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:58,187
You'll learn it's not hard having a
family or making it grow.

248
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:05,986
You'll learn that what's hard,
is keeping it together.

249
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,517
What's going on?

250
00:34:26,567 --> 00:34:28,444
Does my brother's wife like
vallenato music?

251
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:33,658
What's the name of my godson?

252
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:37,077
Miguel Dionisio Pushaina
Abuchaibe.

253
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,249
Just so you won't say
I don't respect your traditions,

254
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,585
I brought a gift.

255
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:47,297
What is it?

256
00:34:55,596 --> 00:34:57,473
We're too big for goats now,
Rafa.

257
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,060
It's yours, my friend!

258
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:04,813
This car costs more than a
shipping!

259
00:35:05,897 --> 00:35:08,650
That's why we have
to make them bigger now.

260
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:11,529
That's what money is for,

261
00:35:11,612 --> 00:35:12,821
to spend it!

262
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:56,448
SONG II
THE GRAVES

263
00:36:43,288 --> 00:36:44,330
Leonidas.

264
00:36:51,504 --> 00:36:54,966
You can't drink liquor.
You must get ready.

265
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:59,636
Now that your uncle Ministro is dead,
it's your right to be head of the family.

266
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:02,265
Behave.

267
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:18,406
If he's a boy, we could name him
Peregrino, like you.

268
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,534
Us Peregrinos, we are restless.

269
00:37:21,783 --> 00:37:27,539
This family needs a stronger name,
worthy of an heir.

270
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,502
Peregrino is a nice name.

271
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:37,883
But it will be a girl, and she must
have a prosperous and luminous name.

272
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:44,098
There's a plague coming.

273
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,768
You've become
too superstitious, mother.

274
00:37:56,402 --> 00:37:58,905
These alijunas
have no respect for anything.

275
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:17,714
I've been looking everywhere for
you. Where were you?

276
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:22,178
Turn down the music, Moncho.

277
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:23,763
This is not a party.

278
00:38:26,015 --> 00:38:27,016
Really?

279
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:32,187
If this is not a party, I wouldn't
want to miss a real one.

280
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:33,855
Turn it off.

281
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:46,077
Relax, my friend.

282
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:47,453
I talked to Bill.

283
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:51,123
- He told me we need 2200 pounds...
- Why did you talk to him?

284
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,794
We need 2200 pounds for next
week.

285
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,130
With what they've sowed,

286
00:38:58,214 --> 00:38:59,757
we can collect 1300 pounds.

287
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,092
We need more.

288
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:03,344
Aníbal is coming here, Moncho.

289
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:05,846
Let's buy from someone else.

290
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:08,808
Aníbal is family. We've always done
business with him.

291
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:11,101
We'll deliver 1300 pounds.
That's it.

292
00:39:16,149 --> 00:39:18,067
And I'm the middleman, is that
clear?

293
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:11,453
Hello, cousin.

294
00:40:12,455 --> 00:40:14,040
Pure Santa Marta Gold.

295
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,875
From the seeds of the Americans?

296
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,678
What do you say, Moncho?

297
00:41:09,761 --> 00:41:10,846
What's up, Ramírez?

298
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:12,848
Getting fatter.

299
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:14,809
And you, uglier.

300
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,686
And Rafa,

301
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:18,855
charming as usual.

302
00:41:26,194 --> 00:41:27,863
Be serious, Moncho.

303
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:45,149
What's wrong?

304
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,486
Two planes can carry 1300 pounds.

305
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:56,076
Fifty pounds in five.

306
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,711
Why are there three planes?

307
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:13,051
Bill said there was no problem.

308
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:19,850
Are you doing business with other people?

309
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:31,946
It's full of weed!

310
00:43:39,578 --> 00:43:41,371
Tell Bill business is done with us only.

311
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:43,749
I'll hold on to the planes
until he makes up for this.

312
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:44,917
Hell no!

313
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:50,255
What did you do?

314
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:51,673
They betrayed us!

315
00:43:53,051 --> 00:43:54,886
That's what the word is for.

316
00:43:56,638 --> 00:43:59,015
So send a word messenger
to the United States.

317
00:44:00,475 --> 00:44:02,101
If you kill him, I'll kill you.

318
00:44:04,145 --> 00:44:06,813
Don't you wanna keep
the money and the weed?

319
00:44:07,565 --> 00:44:09,400
You have no respect for anything.

320
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:22,746
Tell Bill business is done with us.

321
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:31,421
Us Wayúu can't touch murdered men.

322
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:34,717
You'll have to bury them.

323
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:37,219
What shall we do with the planes?

324
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:20,471
You can't do business with alijunas.

325
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:23,266
And gringos? What are they?

326
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:27,312
Or do you know any Wayúu
that'll buy weed from us?

327
00:45:27,812 --> 00:45:29,313
Moisés is out of control.

328
00:45:32,317 --> 00:45:34,193
He made a mistake.

329
00:45:35,236 --> 00:45:36,821
He's staining our name.

330
00:45:39,906 --> 00:45:41,700
Disobeyed you in front of your men.

331
00:45:44,078 --> 00:45:45,580
It won't happen again.

332
00:45:46,748 --> 00:45:48,791
Ask yourself,
where does your loyalty lie?

333
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:51,669
With the alijunas or your family?

334
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:55,924
My word and honor lie with my people.

335
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:14,859
He's right. Who do you choose?

336
00:46:15,652 --> 00:46:16,945
I already said it.

337
00:46:17,946 --> 00:46:19,322
Say it again.

338
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:22,408
My family.

339
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:26,995
So get rid of Moisés.

340
00:46:30,375 --> 00:46:33,169
How will you carry on
doing business after this?

341
00:46:33,877 --> 00:46:36,922
How will you ease the gringos?

342
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:41,051
You must compensate them.

343
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:43,888
Don't put your family at risk.

344
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:49,643
You've been
with the alijunas for too long.

345
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:53,939
A true Wayúu wouldn't hesitate, Rapayet.

346
00:47:00,862 --> 00:47:03,573
The alijuna spilled blood, Rapayet.

347
00:47:04,033 --> 00:47:06,618
He must pay with blood.

348
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:58,212
Rafa!

349
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:02,257
Come, listen to the song
they wrote for us, my friend.

350
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,375
Rafa!

351
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:37,877
I'm glad you came, my friend.

352
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,551
Is this how you spend the money?

353
00:48:46,761 --> 00:48:47,804
What's wrong?

354
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:50,138
We have the money, the weed...

355
00:48:50,223 --> 00:48:52,558
It's the best deal, Rafa.

356
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:53,892
Come.

357
00:48:54,143 --> 00:48:54,936
Let's party.

358
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,103
Get up!

359
00:49:02,694 --> 00:49:03,736
What's the matter?

360
00:49:05,779 --> 00:49:07,114
Are you not gonna celebrate?

361
00:49:08,116 --> 00:49:09,158
It's over.

362
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:12,035
What?

363
00:49:13,538 --> 00:49:16,040
You spilled blood in Wayúu territory.

364
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:20,044
The foreigners' blood must be compensated.

365
00:49:24,966 --> 00:49:26,384
Shut the fuck up!

366
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:32,015
The Pushaina family

367
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:34,016
advised Rapayet

368
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:35,685
to kill you.

369
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:41,065
But it won't happen,

370
00:49:41,232 --> 00:49:43,359
because Rapayet is fond of you.

371
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:45,819
But you have to leave the business.

372
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:54,203
Everyone leave!

373
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:55,997
Get out!

374
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:58,750
This shit is over!

375
00:50:06,132 --> 00:50:07,675
You can't do this, Rafa.

376
00:50:08,551 --> 00:50:13,640
For every deal, you'll get a commission
to give the police their cut.

377
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:16,600
But if you do any business
behind Rapayet's back,

378
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:19,603
he'll have to follow his clan's advice.

379
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:26,152
You can't do this to me, Rafa.

380
00:50:28,112 --> 00:50:29,822
You would be nothing without me.

381
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:32,992
Aren't we friends?

382
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:35,370
Aren't we brothers, Rafa?

383
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:47,257
Rafa!

384
00:51:10,029 --> 00:51:11,656
Get down, Leonidas.

385
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:17,870
You drive too fast.

386
00:51:18,746 --> 00:51:20,248
We're leaving.

387
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,167
Where are you going?

388
00:51:24,377 --> 00:51:25,712
To make a delivery.

389
00:51:26,879 --> 00:51:27,964
Can I go?

390
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:37,431
Be careful, Rapayet.

391
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:40,435
Look.

392
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:46,231
The iishcoo bird has been coming for days.

393
00:51:47,357 --> 00:51:49,276
He's asking for payback.

394
00:52:17,388 --> 00:52:18,264
Nothing.

395
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:23,352
It's been too long.
Something's not right.

396
00:52:27,982 --> 00:52:28,942
Leonidas.

397
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:30,985
Leonidas!

398
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:35,322
Are we leaving?

399
00:52:35,406 --> 00:52:36,824
No, go back.

400
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:39,076
You never let me do anything!

401
00:52:39,993 --> 00:52:43,246
You're here because they forced me
to bring you along. Do as I say!

402
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:20,492
Don't get out!

403
00:53:45,685 --> 00:53:47,103
Go tell Aníbal.

404
00:53:47,312 --> 00:53:50,230
Tell him to bring the women.
I'll stay here.

405
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:23,408
I go alone.

406
00:56:20,882 --> 00:56:21,925
Get dressed.

407
00:56:23,384 --> 00:56:25,136
You don't have to turn me in, Rafa.

408
00:56:27,513 --> 00:56:29,681
I have your share. I kept it for you.

409
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:32,935
We can keep going, you and I.

410
00:56:33,937 --> 00:56:35,063
Just like before.

411
00:56:38,565 --> 00:56:40,067
So, what are you going to do?

412
00:56:41,361 --> 00:56:42,527
Are you going to kill me?

413
00:56:45,156 --> 00:56:46,699
You can't kill me, my friend.

414
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:55,290
I'll kill you like the Wayúu do,

415
00:56:56,833 --> 00:56:57,877
face to face.

416
00:57:00,545 --> 00:57:02,631
We've always been together, Rafa.

417
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:06,052
You're my brother.

418
00:57:15,103 --> 00:57:16,437
I knew you didn't have it in you.

419
00:58:22,962 --> 00:58:24,964
Don't come inside!

420
00:58:25,797 --> 00:58:27,382
His blood is all over you.

421
00:58:27,634 --> 00:58:30,053
The yoluja is with you!

422
00:58:31,011 --> 00:58:32,554
It's your fault, Mom.

423
00:58:32,721 --> 00:58:36,100
Your daughter has just been born!
Stay away!

424
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,770
You brought the ghost
of a dead man with you.

425
00:58:53,116 --> 00:58:54,618
You can't touch her.

426
00:58:58,748 --> 00:58:59,666
Indira.

427
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,795
How's Zaida?

428
00:59:04,712 --> 00:59:05,880
She's fine.

429
00:59:12,136 --> 00:59:13,221
I want to go in.

430
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:17,725
You have touched him.

431
00:59:17,808 --> 00:59:20,143
If you don't clean yourself,
it will stick to her.

432
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:29,070
I'll go take a bath.

433
00:59:30,071 --> 00:59:30,822
No.

434
00:59:30,904 --> 00:59:33,156
Aníbal must see the blood.

435
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:08,735
Aníbal.

436
01:00:09,192 --> 01:00:11,446
I've come to talk to you.

437
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:15,074
I don't want anything to do with Rapayet.

438
01:00:15,283 --> 01:00:17,326
It's not about Rapayet.

439
01:00:17,743 --> 01:00:20,954
I come on behalf of Úrsula Pushaina.
Will you not receive her word?

440
01:00:25,208 --> 01:00:26,627
Over the last two years,

441
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:29,755
the wealth of both families
has increased like never before.

442
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,966
Prosperity can only bloom
if there's peace.

443
01:00:33,967 --> 01:00:38,388
Moisés killed my brother.
Rapayet didn't stop him on time.

444
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,973
You're right, Aníbal.

445
01:00:40,391 --> 01:00:43,436
But he's done it now.
Peace is guaranteed.

446
01:00:45,062 --> 01:00:47,689
I don't want to do business
with Rapayet anymore.

447
01:00:47,774 --> 01:00:52,194
When you talk to Rapayet,
you talk to the Pushaina clan.

448
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:57,699
What's your answer?

449
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:02,413
I want 100 pesos per pound.

450
01:01:11,214 --> 01:01:14,174
Very well, Aníbal.

451
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:43,996
SONG III
PROSPERITY

452
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:55,545
Son!

453
01:03:56,295 --> 01:03:57,922
You were great.

454
01:03:58,714 --> 01:04:01,133
You rode like a true Wayúu.

455
01:04:01,466 --> 01:04:04,219
I almost finished last.

456
01:04:04,846 --> 01:04:06,097
It doesn't matter.

457
01:04:06,888 --> 01:04:09,433
None of them rode at your age.

458
01:04:10,143 --> 01:04:13,938
I want to learn
how to fly a plane, not ride a horse.

459
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,958
Leonidas, give me the gun.

460
01:04:35,042 --> 01:04:36,294
Don't bother me.

461
01:04:48,806 --> 01:04:50,433
Give me the gun, son.

462
01:04:53,018 --> 01:04:54,312
Give me the gun.

463
01:05:50,368 --> 01:05:54,080
The sacrifice has been made,
but there's sadness.

464
01:05:57,583 --> 01:06:00,086
Gabriel is announcing his second burial.

465
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:06,133
The dead are coming to the house.
Miguel is in danger.

466
01:06:10,138 --> 01:06:12,556
Rapayet and Leonidas were there.

467
01:06:17,437 --> 01:06:18,438
Did you see them?

468
01:06:20,897 --> 01:06:21,774
No.

469
01:06:29,156 --> 01:06:31,158
Request the talisman's protection.

470
01:07:29,926 --> 01:07:32,136
You're not alone, Rapayet.

471
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:37,015
Have you seen a yoluja?

472
01:07:39,726 --> 01:07:40,770
Hi, nephew.

473
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:42,146
Hi, uncle.

474
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:48,652
Aníbal invited us
to his brother's second wake.

475
01:07:54,158 --> 01:07:56,828
Zaida saw Gabriel in a dream.

476
01:07:58,578 --> 01:08:02,499
Maybe he was announcing himself too,
like he did to his family.

477
01:08:03,292 --> 01:08:05,294
We must go, Rapayet.

478
01:08:05,877 --> 01:08:10,966
Aníbal is not just family,
he's our partner.

479
01:08:11,301 --> 01:08:12,552
We shouldn't go.

480
01:08:14,386 --> 01:08:18,849
If we don't, he will take it
as an offense to his family.

481
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:20,559
Do you want that?

482
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:24,980
Zaida also saw Miguel. He was covered.

483
01:08:26,608 --> 01:08:28,693
There's too much death around.

484
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:48,337
Thank you for inviting us, cousin.

485
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:51,256
What is it that you got there?

486
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:56,803
The Pushaina family wants to celebrate
its friendship with your family.

487
01:08:57,095 --> 01:09:02,476
It's a gift for the wake.
Ten cows and 30 goats.

488
01:09:03,019 --> 01:09:04,062
Thank you.

489
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:13,111
Each gun has its own license.

490
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:21,703
A bit too much, don't you think?

491
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:25,416
Thank you for coming, Úrsula.

492
01:09:28,044 --> 01:09:29,086
Join me.

493
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:34,926
Let's get out of here, Rapayet.

494
01:10:27,437 --> 01:10:31,189
Now is the time when the dead come back.

495
01:10:32,024 --> 01:10:35,068
The time to understand what happened.

496
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:40,574
Why they are gone and what is
the message they're bringing us.

497
01:10:41,533 --> 01:10:45,746
The time for us to listen

498
01:10:46,038 --> 01:10:50,585
to what they are teaching us

499
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:57,050
through their senseless death,

500
01:10:58,675 --> 01:11:03,722
caused by blind ambition.

501
01:11:04,139 --> 01:11:08,936
Now that we are exhuming you

502
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:16,277
and taking you
to your final resting place,

503
01:11:17,946 --> 01:11:22,449
let us be still.
Let us listen and understand

504
01:11:22,658 --> 01:11:27,037
why you had to leave like this.

505
01:11:28,915 --> 01:11:33,169
Let us not be blind.

506
01:11:33,836 --> 01:11:38,341
Let us not be deaf.

507
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:44,429
Let no gold shine brighter
than our spirit.

508
01:11:45,555 --> 01:11:49,768
Let no voice or gunshot
be louder than your voice.

509
01:13:17,648 --> 01:13:19,900
What on earth are you doing? Come with me!

510
01:13:27,367 --> 01:13:29,202
Burials are so boring.

511
01:13:31,328 --> 01:13:32,830
Why did you come, then?

512
01:13:37,042 --> 01:13:38,419
Because I was forced.

513
01:14:06,698 --> 01:14:08,408
Look what I can do.

514
01:14:55,371 --> 01:14:56,331
For you,

515
01:14:56,831 --> 01:14:58,625
I'd eat a lemon and its skin.

516
01:15:06,882 --> 01:15:09,551
Come with me to Aruba.
I'll give you anything you want.

517
01:15:10,428 --> 01:15:12,513
Sigifredo, take this drunkard away.

518
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:18,060
Let's dance.

519
01:15:20,145 --> 01:15:21,104
Come dance with me.

520
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:23,857
- Leave!
- Don't touch her!

521
01:15:24,317 --> 01:15:25,902
No one can touch her.

522
01:15:26,068 --> 01:15:27,194
Mister Leonidas.

523
01:15:28,153 --> 01:15:29,656
Let's go, sir. You're drunk.

524
01:15:36,996 --> 01:15:39,290
Bring the money from the truck.

525
01:15:42,669 --> 01:15:45,296
- No, Leonidas.
- Bring the money from the fucking truck!

526
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,728
This man wants to become
some kind of a lawyer.

527
01:16:03,189 --> 01:16:05,066
Look how generous I am.

528
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,903
I'll pay for his degree and his trip,

529
01:16:10,321 --> 01:16:12,364
but only if he eats that dog's shit.

530
01:16:20,665 --> 01:16:21,666
No, sir.

531
01:16:32,385 --> 01:16:33,344
No, sir.

532
01:16:35,179 --> 01:16:37,890
Too proud for a shitty bodyguard.

533
01:16:40,393 --> 01:16:41,394
Put it there.

534
01:16:48,025 --> 01:16:49,359
It's all yours.

535
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:53,156
You can pay for whores
and anything you want.

536
01:17:48,294 --> 01:17:50,337
You're the man, boss.

537
01:18:38,553 --> 01:18:39,470
Hello.

538
01:18:41,305 --> 01:18:42,848
I come on behalf of mister Aníbal.

539
01:18:43,349 --> 01:18:45,310
Word must be brought by a word messenger.

540
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:51,232
I'm the word messenger now.

541
01:18:52,065 --> 01:18:54,359
I won't receive the word from an alijuna.

542
01:18:55,819 --> 01:18:57,029
What does Aníbal want?

543
01:18:58,448 --> 01:19:00,908
This is not the way we do things.

544
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:05,412
Mister Aníbal wants to be compensated.

545
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:06,955
With two trucks,

546
01:19:08,166 --> 01:19:09,208
ten mules,

547
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:11,001
and two rifles.

548
01:19:11,085 --> 01:19:14,130
We won't compensate him
until he sends a word messenger!

549
01:19:16,424 --> 01:19:17,550
What else?

550
01:19:21,511 --> 01:19:23,014
And two weeks of mister Leonidas,

551
01:19:23,473 --> 01:19:24,890
working as a peasant in his fields.

552
01:19:24,974 --> 01:19:26,100
Say that again and I’ll kill you!

553
01:19:26,224 --> 01:19:27,434
Put the gun down!

554
01:19:27,644 --> 01:19:29,145
Let Leonidas kill him!

555
01:19:30,063 --> 01:19:33,232
- Aníbal knows no Wayúu would accept that.
- Shut up!

556
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,524
Shut up!

557
01:19:38,571 --> 01:19:40,156
Leonidas, go.

558
01:19:48,206 --> 01:19:50,833
By sending the alijuna,
Aníbal is humiliating you.

559
01:19:51,333 --> 01:19:54,962
You can't accept anything.

560
01:19:55,755 --> 01:19:57,799
We have offended his family many times.

561
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,473
If you don't agree,
there will be a war, Rapayet.

562
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:07,391
You can't let that happen.

563
01:20:09,059 --> 01:20:10,352
Do you need a minute?

564
01:20:13,314 --> 01:20:15,900
A little work won't harm him.

565
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:25,158
Leonidas will fulfill
his part of the compensation.

566
01:21:17,127 --> 01:21:18,462
What's wrong?

567
01:21:22,175 --> 01:21:23,967
Did you see it again?

568
01:21:31,725 --> 01:21:33,018
It'll go away.

569
01:21:33,226 --> 01:21:34,729
Close your eyes.

570
01:22:05,009 --> 01:22:07,011
Welcome, mister Leonidas.

571
01:22:19,857 --> 01:22:21,400
What do we have here?

572
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:51,680
Here's your compensation.

573
01:22:53,349 --> 01:22:54,851
You offended my daughter.

574
01:22:55,809 --> 01:22:57,477
Apologize and you can go home.

575
01:23:07,697 --> 01:23:09,032
Apologize!

576
01:23:13,161 --> 01:23:14,746
Go to work then.

577
01:23:39,519 --> 01:23:43,148
The satchel is like the Wayúu.

578
01:23:44,067 --> 01:23:47,904
Round like the mother's womb.
This rope, it's umbilical cord.

579
01:23:48,613 --> 01:23:49,614
Indira.

580
01:23:50,073 --> 01:23:51,074
It's late.

581
01:23:51,698 --> 01:23:53,201
We haven't finished.

582
01:23:54,661 --> 01:23:56,287
You can finish tomorrow.

583
01:24:05,212 --> 01:24:06,546
It's important.

584
01:24:08,049 --> 01:24:09,634
You can finish tomorrow.

585
01:24:20,812 --> 01:24:23,022
I'll stay here until you fall asleep.

586
01:24:53,928 --> 01:24:55,596
What were you dreaming?

587
01:24:57,431 --> 01:25:00,309
Nothing. It felt as if I was falling.

588
01:25:02,185 --> 01:25:03,270
What else?

589
01:25:05,857 --> 01:25:07,108
Nothing.

590
01:25:12,654 --> 01:25:14,948
You don't talk to the dream anymore.

591
01:25:26,544 --> 01:25:29,671
I killed you because
you had no respect for the word.

592
01:25:30,924 --> 01:25:33,842
And now,
no one respects anything, my friend.

593
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:36,386
I can't lose my family again.

594
01:25:39,181 --> 01:25:41,099
I can't lose them in another war.

595
01:25:43,353 --> 01:25:45,730
What does the yoluja tell you?

596
01:25:49,149 --> 01:25:51,109
Nothing.

597
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:52,778
He's just there.

598
01:25:55,073 --> 01:25:56,491
Bring Leonidas back.

599
01:25:59,702 --> 01:26:02,372
This won't end here.

600
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,375
Did the dream tell you that?

601
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:11,297
No.

602
01:26:13,299 --> 01:26:14,967
The spirits are offended.

603
01:26:15,592 --> 01:26:19,013
The dream hasn't talked to me
since we went to Aníbal's.

604
01:26:21,474 --> 01:26:24,185
We've lost the soul.

605
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:28,773
Nothing protects us anymore.

606
01:26:30,483 --> 01:26:31,317
Rapayet.

607
01:26:32,527 --> 01:26:33,611
Bring my son back.

608
01:26:33,987 --> 01:26:36,072
You should've never agreed
to send him away.

609
01:29:39,714 --> 01:29:44,928
SONG IV
THE WAR

610
01:30:09,034 --> 01:30:10,077
Now that one.

611
01:30:23,757 --> 01:30:26,510
I'll be safe if I'm surrounded by men.

612
01:30:32,015 --> 01:30:34,184
Those shitty necklaces are useless!

613
01:30:46,531 --> 01:30:49,199
Don't let him out.

614
01:30:49,742 --> 01:30:52,745
If someone comes, tell them
your daughter is in confinement.

615
01:31:26,237 --> 01:31:27,154
Aníbal.

616
01:31:28,197 --> 01:31:33,118
In a dispute, it isn't common for the
offending party to send a word messenger.

617
01:31:33,202 --> 01:31:36,205
But I've come to bring you the word.

618
01:31:36,413 --> 01:31:40,960
Rapayet wants to avoid war at all cost.
He wants to compensate you.

619
01:31:42,754 --> 01:31:47,257
What Leonidas did is unforgivable.

620
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:52,096
He's a bad seed
who doesn't represent his family.

621
01:31:53,473 --> 01:31:55,265
There's nothing to talk about.

622
01:31:55,724 --> 01:31:57,726
He dishonored my daughter.

623
01:31:58,269 --> 01:31:59,437
He's a Pushaina.

624
01:31:59,895 --> 01:32:02,439
There's more at stake.

625
01:32:02,773 --> 01:32:09,112
Your relationship with Rapayet and
his family goes well beyond this dispute.

626
01:32:12,867 --> 01:32:14,869
You shouldn't have come, Peregrino.

627
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:22,209
We're living
violent, uncertain times, Aníbal.

628
01:32:22,626 --> 01:32:28,966
You can't turn down Rapayet's offer
without even listening.

629
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:34,596
What is he offering?

630
01:32:34,889 --> 01:32:36,140
Everything.

631
01:32:36,599 --> 01:32:41,062
His trucks, planes,
landing spots, everything.

632
01:32:41,144 --> 01:32:44,982
Even his American connections.

633
01:32:55,242 --> 01:32:56,285
No.

634
01:33:03,542 --> 01:33:04,544
Aníbal.

635
01:33:05,211 --> 01:33:07,213
You can't kill a word messenger.

636
01:33:07,755 --> 01:33:12,467
If you kill the word, you'll be offending
the most sacred law of the Wayúu.

637
01:33:12,969 --> 01:33:15,721
You will not only go to war
with the Pushaina clan,

638
01:33:15,805 --> 01:33:19,100
but also with the Uliana clan,
your own clan.

639
01:34:31,546 --> 01:34:33,257
Do you still want peace?

640
01:34:48,439 --> 01:34:49,649
Let's go, Rapayet.

641
01:34:59,157 --> 01:35:02,536
You know what happens to a family
in a war.

642
01:35:02,662 --> 01:35:03,579
Let's go.

643
01:35:05,122 --> 01:35:06,373
Where?

644
01:35:09,251 --> 01:35:12,129
Wherever they won't find us.
It doesn't matter.

645
01:35:14,172 --> 01:35:17,719
Moisés will follow me wherever I go.

646
01:35:18,428 --> 01:35:20,179
It doesn't matter, Rapayet.

647
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:27,270
Miguel is in danger.
I saw it in the dream.

648
01:35:57,175 --> 01:35:59,344
Don't come back until you've found them.

649
01:36:17,111 --> 01:36:18,738
Are they Aníbal's people?

650
01:36:20,864 --> 01:36:21,782
No.

651
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:26,411
They're the word messengers
and the clans' elders.

652
01:36:50,687 --> 01:36:55,024
Aníbal Abuchaibe, from the Uliana clan,
committed the unrepairable

653
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:59,069
and murdered a word messenger.

654
01:36:59,862 --> 01:37:04,408
He has become a threat to our clan
and to the region's peace.

655
01:37:05,076 --> 01:37:07,453
It's our duty to keep him
from spreading chaos.

656
01:37:07,537 --> 01:37:10,915
Ever since he started trading weed,

657
01:37:11,081 --> 01:37:14,042
Peregrino fell like the bird Utta,

658
01:37:14,919 --> 01:37:19,090
whose necklaces were so heavy
from being so wealthy.

659
01:37:19,256 --> 01:37:21,842
He stopped being a word messenger
and died as an alijuna.

660
01:37:21,925 --> 01:37:27,014
He was a remarkable Wayúu
and we shouldn't mention his name.

661
01:37:27,264 --> 01:37:32,102
Let's not forget no one
had ever killed a word messenger.

662
01:37:32,394 --> 01:37:37,858
Peregrino allowed Úrsula's family
to desecrate our traditions.

663
01:37:38,775 --> 01:37:42,904
Our word messenger died trying
to prevent this war.

664
01:37:43,698 --> 01:37:48,161
We must stop Aníbal before
his war spreads throughout the Wajira.

665
01:37:49,037 --> 01:37:51,873
We can do it if we unite.

666
01:37:55,835 --> 01:37:57,252
Where is Rapayet?

667
01:37:58,129 --> 01:37:59,296
He ran away.

668
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:06,595
Úrsula and Rapayet
use their sacred cemetery

669
01:38:06,763 --> 01:38:10,975
to hide money and weapons.

670
01:38:11,893 --> 01:38:16,814
Aníbal, Úrsula and Rapayet
have stained our clan's name.

671
01:38:17,023 --> 01:38:19,984
They no longer act as Wayúus.

672
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,237
They act as alijunas.

673
01:38:23,654 --> 01:38:26,073
Us Wayúus are not what they have become.

674
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:29,577
I won't order my family to lend
their lives for a dispute of alijunas.

675
01:38:29,786 --> 01:38:33,581
My family will not be a part
of this vengeance either.

676
01:38:33,747 --> 01:38:37,085
This has always been our territory.

677
01:38:37,376 --> 01:38:41,004
We've always protected it
with honor and bravery

678
01:38:41,214 --> 01:38:43,757
when it has been necessary.

679
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:47,136
Our ancestors defended it from pirates,

680
01:38:47,761 --> 01:38:51,474
from Englishmen, from Spaniards.

681
01:38:51,933 --> 01:38:55,937
And from the governments that tried
to take it away and tell us how to live.

682
01:38:56,019 --> 01:39:00,524
This ain't alijunas' territory,
it's our ancestors'.

683
01:39:01,024 --> 01:39:05,279
We won't allow these new weed sellers
to fill it with violence.

684
01:39:05,947 --> 01:39:08,616
Punishment for Aníbal and his family!

685
01:39:08,824 --> 01:39:10,158
This has to stop.

686
01:39:12,202 --> 01:39:16,248
Violence against the word
is unprecedented.

687
01:39:16,873 --> 01:39:19,251
It has to be punished.

688
01:39:19,544 --> 01:39:23,506
But before we punish Aníbal,
Úrsula's family has to compensate us.

689
01:39:23,797 --> 01:39:27,135
They must give up this cemetery
and exhume their dead.

690
01:39:27,301 --> 01:39:31,471
Úrsula must give back the talisman that
protects her family, and her necklaces.

691
01:39:32,889 --> 01:39:33,974
Give it back.

692
01:39:34,309 --> 01:39:37,145
The Arpushana family agrees
on the punishment,

693
01:39:37,312 --> 01:39:39,897
if Úrsula gives back
the talisman and necklaces.

694
01:39:40,064 --> 01:39:45,069
The Juusayú family will send men
to help with Aníbal's punishment.

695
01:39:46,653 --> 01:39:50,657
The Epieyúu family joins the punishment
for the Pushaina and Abuchaibe families.

696
01:40:20,479 --> 01:40:21,939
Goyo, Goyo, Goyo.

697
01:40:22,898 --> 01:40:23,982
Over.

698
01:40:28,528 --> 01:40:30,447
Clean everything up. We're coming over.

699
01:40:30,614 --> 01:40:32,282
Pick up, pick up. Over.

700
01:40:37,788 --> 01:40:39,581
Pick up, Goyo. We're coming.

701
01:40:39,623 --> 01:40:40,666
Over.

702
01:41:37,348 --> 01:41:38,433
Go inside!

703
01:42:12,966 --> 01:42:15,969
I've come for you and my grandchildren.

704
01:42:21,059 --> 01:42:21,851
No.

705
01:42:25,438 --> 01:42:27,440
You belong with me, daughter.

706
01:42:35,782 --> 01:42:40,119
You can't live as a Wayúu
if you're away from your family.

707
01:42:41,828 --> 01:42:44,165
What's the use
of being a Wayúu if we die.

708
01:43:15,321 --> 01:43:18,573
Come with me and Rapayet won't be hurt.

709
01:43:28,751 --> 01:43:31,296
Don't take them away. Please.
Don't do this.

710
01:44:13,004 --> 01:44:16,549
If you come looking for them,
I'll kill you.

711
01:45:20,363 --> 01:45:21,447
How many did they kill?

712
01:45:25,702 --> 01:45:27,453
You don't want to know.

713
01:45:29,538 --> 01:45:30,998
What about the sown fields?

714
01:45:33,458 --> 01:45:34,460
Mister Aníbal,

715
01:45:34,961 --> 01:45:37,130
it's a miracle
those Indians didn't kill us.

716
01:45:40,757 --> 01:45:42,676
I've had it. I'm going back to Medellín.

717
01:45:43,219 --> 01:45:44,721
There's nothing left to do here.

718
01:45:46,096 --> 01:45:47,889
Bring me men from Medellín.

719
01:45:49,975 --> 01:45:52,019
You can have what's left of the crops.

720
01:45:52,103 --> 01:45:53,855
They burned everything down.

721
01:45:54,147 --> 01:45:55,398
There's nothing left.

722
01:45:56,064 --> 01:45:59,277
I have 2800 pounds left.
Only I know where they are.

723
01:46:01,446 --> 01:46:05,241
You can have the house, the cars,
the hidden money, everything.

724
01:46:27,639 --> 01:46:31,225
Are you willing to give up everything
just to have your revenge?

725
01:46:34,854 --> 01:46:36,356
How soon can you bring them?

726
01:50:09,861 --> 01:50:11,778
There's money in the satchel.

727
01:50:13,031 --> 01:50:16,158
Go find Leonidas.

728
01:50:25,292 --> 01:50:26,501
Go.

729
01:50:30,089 --> 01:50:32,382
Go and never come back!

730
01:50:42,769 --> 01:50:43,686
Go!

731
01:50:46,397 --> 01:50:47,314
Go!

732
01:50:58,533 --> 01:51:03,038
SONG V
LIMBO

733
01:51:19,305 --> 01:51:20,682
Uncle!

734
01:51:25,060 --> 01:51:26,813
Uncle Leonidas!

735
01:51:51,254 --> 01:51:52,212
And so?

736
01:51:54,924 --> 01:51:57,801
We have nothing left
in this world, Aníbal.

737
01:52:00,388 --> 01:52:02,265
But have some respect for the dead.

738
01:52:03,015 --> 01:52:04,474
Give me my grandson back.

739
01:52:07,604 --> 01:52:10,023
I'll give him back on two conditions.

740
01:52:12,108 --> 01:52:13,650
Hand over your businesses,

741
01:52:14,359 --> 01:52:16,528
the weed you have left, your planes,

742
01:52:16,696 --> 01:52:20,533
- your landing strips...
- I came to talk to you, not to him.

743
01:52:22,034 --> 01:52:24,412
He's the one you need to talk to now.

744
01:52:26,913 --> 01:52:29,583
Arrange one more delivery
with your connection.

745
01:52:32,461 --> 01:52:33,962
What's the other thing?

746
01:52:35,672 --> 01:52:37,090
Bring me Rapayet.

747
01:52:37,341 --> 01:52:38,425
And Leonidas.

748
01:52:41,136 --> 01:52:42,679
Leonidas is dead.

749
01:52:43,764 --> 01:52:46,767
- Then tell me where Rapayet is.
- I want Leonidas as well.

750
01:52:46,893 --> 01:52:48,226
Shut the fuck up!

751
01:52:48,644 --> 01:52:49,853
You'll do what I say.

752
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:52,189
Settle for Rapayet.

753
01:52:53,774 --> 01:52:55,400
I'll give you Rapayet.

754
01:52:57,111 --> 01:52:58,237
You can kill me.

755
01:52:59,613 --> 01:53:01,239
Let Indira live.

756
01:53:01,823 --> 01:53:03,992
You're not even worth the bullet, ma'am.

757
01:54:58,273 --> 01:54:59,650
Where is Leonidas?

758
01:55:06,157 --> 01:55:07,784
I won't stop until I kill him.

759
01:55:09,202 --> 01:55:11,371
We're all dead already.

760
01:56:24,234 --> 01:56:25,569
Take them.

761
01:56:58,101 --> 01:57:02,564
And so, when I saw this Wayúu girl
who didn't know how to herd,

762
01:57:02,732 --> 01:57:06,861
who had forgotten her ancestor's knowledge
and was left alone to wander

763
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:10,156
in the desert and in the dark,
is how I learned about this story.

764
01:57:10,238 --> 01:57:14,660
A story about a wild grass that came
as a savior, but destroyed like locusts.

765
01:57:14,827 --> 01:57:17,997
This grass took other shapes
and it was always joined by greed.

766
01:57:18,122 --> 01:57:20,375
And so a great wanulü beast was awakened,

767
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:25,296
and its shadow darkened the whole world.

768
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:29,092
If we had only listened to the dreams,
if we had only heard the dead's voices.

769
01:57:29,259 --> 01:57:34,138
Strong winds are coming now.
They'll erase our footprints on the sand,

770
01:57:34,471 --> 01:57:37,058
that's why I sing on this day.

771
01:57:37,183 --> 01:57:42,063
So Wayúus and alijunas won't forget
what the summer winds erase.

772
01:57:42,188 --> 01:57:45,440
So that the birds can sing this story,
so it can remain forever,

773
01:57:45,608 --> 01:57:48,987
in the place of dreams and memory.

774
