1
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:32,249
Every second, a human soul
enters this world.

2
00:01:32,452 --> 00:01:34,807
A new light is lit.

3
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:39,210
A star that may burn
unusually bright.

4
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:44,008
One that has its own spectre,
never to be beheld.

5
00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:45,804
A new being -

6
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:51,291
- that may sprinkle genius,
perhaps beauty, about it, -

7
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:53,323
- kisses Earth.

8
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:57,684
The never seen
becomes flesh and blood.

9
00:01:57,892 --> 00:02:01,646
So the humans rejoice
for every newly lit soul.

10
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:04,810
They stand about him
with questioning eyes.

11
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:08,448
Do they wonder
what this newcomer will bring ?

12
00:02:08,652 --> 00:02:10,449
No, man is no star -

13
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:13,485
- that you win renown
by discovering.

14
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:16,923
It's often a parasite
that steals into the world -

15
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:19,566
- through nine months
of Purgatory.

16
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:23,526
And it doesn't even have
its papers in order.

17
00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:28,886
Here's the kid's birth certificate
for the teacher.

18
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:32,528
"Born out of wedlock."
Does it have to say that?

19
00:02:32,732 --> 00:02:36,771
Yes, it's the law.
When the kid is illegitimate.

20
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:41,409
- And it'll be there forever?
- Yes.

21
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:44,251
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

22
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:48,442
Congratulations.

23
00:02:50,492 --> 00:02:52,881
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

24
00:02:54,652 --> 00:02:57,689
Illegitimate.

25
00:02:57,892 --> 00:03:01,521
You can't tell by looking at her.

26
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:05,042
I don't care what she is,
she has to eat.

27
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:09,086
- Where do I find the money?
- I have to take up fishing again.

28
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:11,522
Your back can't take that, Søren.

29
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:15,645
Nobody thinks about me.
What's to happen with me?

30
00:03:15,852 --> 00:03:20,562
- The son from the Sandfarm?
- Yes.

31
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:24,082
He's the father?

32
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,965
Then he'll have to wed you.

33
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:32,326
- I'll go and talk to the farmer.
- Søren, you wouldn't dare.

34
00:03:32,532 --> 00:03:36,366
Yes. I will go to
the Sandfarm tomorrow.

35
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:51,928
- Now the girl's got a kid.
- That's how it's supposed to be.

36
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:55,681
She says you're the father.

37
00:03:55,892 --> 00:03:56,927
Can she prove it?

38
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:02,365
She can swear to it.
You'd better marry the girl.

39
00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:05,086
- You laugh!
- Listen now.

40
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:09,922
The two of us should have
a sensible chat about these matters.

41
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:12,965
I don't think my son
will marry her.

42
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:15,322
I'll bloody well make him.

43
00:04:15,532 --> 00:04:19,810
The only thing that can make him
is the law. And it won't.

44
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:25,132
But one might help the girl
find a proper match.

45
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:29,769
Look at this. You can have these.
Once and for all.

46
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:33,931
- I didn't come to get money.
- Be reasonable, Søren Man.

47
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:37,727
- Yes, those are big notes.
- Here.

48
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:41,481
I'll send you a note
and get your signature.

49
00:04:41,692 --> 00:04:43,967
We'd better do this by the book.

50
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:49,200
The kid will bear the girl's name
and can make no demands from us.

51
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:51,767
Let it never be said
that our people -

52
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:54,202
- scale the neighbour's fence -

53
00:04:54,412 --> 00:04:58,485
- without paying for
the damage they do.

54
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:02,729
- Goodbye, Søren.
- Goodbye.

55
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:07,082
Thank you. Goodbye.

56
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,441
I won't stay here
if I don't get a father for her.

57
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:23,804
The women look at me.
Talk about me.

58
00:05:24,012 --> 00:05:27,049
Their eyes have been here
for months.

59
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:32,485
They're still there.
I can feel them.

60
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:36,526
They will probably accept you
on the Sandfarm.

61
00:05:36,732 --> 00:05:40,008
Haven't I always said
you were a rich man's child?

62
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:43,807
Yes, not by birth
but by grace.

63
00:05:44,012 --> 00:05:49,245
Children like that will always
bring their parents happiness.

64
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:16,207
Are you going sailing again?

65
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:21,805
Yes, if they'll let me tag along,
I'm going sailing again.

66
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:28,042
and if she for a tiny child

67
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:32,928
has wept such bitter tears

68
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:38,729
she'll sit upon a big pile

69
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:44,689
of pelts from minks and bears

70
00:07:13,652 --> 00:07:18,123
now granny spins a yarn

71
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:24,043
for bed-ticks
and for cushions blue

72
00:07:24,252 --> 00:07:32,330
so Ditte can sleep properly
alongside her prince so true

73
00:07:40,012 --> 00:07:43,368
- Ditte doesn't like the trees.
- And why not?

74
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:48,327
- The trees are making wind.
- It's the Lord who makes the winds.

75
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:51,968
Then grandfather
won't have to row so hard.

76
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,130
What does the Lord look like?

77
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:57,766
The Lord, you say?

78
00:07:57,972 --> 00:08:02,170
Well, he's got his hands full.

79
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:04,328
Yet it may seem to us -

80
00:08:04,532 --> 00:08:09,162
- that he occasionally takes on
more than he can manage.

81
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:11,328
That's what he looks like.

82
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:16,925
What happened, Søren?

83
00:08:17,132 --> 00:08:20,329
This will be the end of me.

84
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:25,809
Søren, come here.

85
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:29,925
Go to bed, Ditte child.
Granny will come.

86
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:34,849
I can undress by myself.

87
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:49,001
Yes, go to bed.
Granddad told you to.

88
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:53,285
No, you can't do it yourself.
Mother will do it.

89
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:56,882
This will be the end of me.

90
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:07,288
We've gone through
sickness and health, Maren.

91
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:10,052
And now it's all over.

92
00:09:10,252 --> 00:09:14,131
Will you be faithful to me
for the days that you have left?

93
00:09:14,332 --> 00:09:16,084
Yes.

94
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:21,320
There has never been
anyone else in my mind, -

95
00:09:21,532 --> 00:09:25,366
- and there never will be
anyone else.

96
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:30,726
I will swear by our Lord
Jesus Christ.

97
00:09:30,932 --> 00:09:34,766
Have faith in that, Søren.

98
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,368
Granny, aren't you coming?

99
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:50,125
Yes, I'll be right there,
Ditte love.

100
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:12,771
There's old Maren and Ditte,
they're begging.

101
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,408
Why isn't anyone coming?

102
00:10:20,612 --> 00:10:24,924
There is no better way
of keeping people down -

103
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:27,692
- than keeping them waiting.

104
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:30,770
Just waiting.

105
00:10:33,932 --> 00:10:37,242
ls that you? It’s freezing!
Hold on a minute.

106
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:43,482
God grant work and food
to each and every one of you.

107
00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:49,289
For these are hard times,
and nothing comes for free.

108
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:57,561
They didn't have anything
they could spare.

109
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,245
There's wise Maren,
riding the storm.

110
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:26,081
It’s great weather
for a witch to be out in.

111
00:11:28,852 --> 00:11:34,290
You just have to turn your bum to
the storm and let it have its way.

112
00:11:35,332 --> 00:11:38,927
It’s a good thing
that you remembered the rock.

113
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:43,922
Granny's feet feel like ice.

114
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:49,047
It was a shame that we didn't get
any sugar, right, Ditte?

115
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:54,406
People are loath to give away
the things they like best.

116
00:11:54,612 --> 00:12:00,482
Ditte? See if there isn't
a bit of sugar in that bag.

117
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:09,202
- There's nothing, granny.
- Let me have a look.

118
00:12:12,012 --> 00:12:14,242
There's nothing.

119
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:16,920
Then it won't be real coffee.

120
00:12:17,132 --> 00:12:19,771
Right or left?

121
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,691
You little rascal.

122
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:28,046
My dear girl, what have you saved
for your granny this time?

123
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:32,723
Left, of course.
It’s closer to the heart?

124
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:37,403
Exactly.
One, two, three.

125
00:12:37,612 --> 00:12:41,730
The last one for granny's
second cup of coffee.

126
00:12:41,932 --> 00:12:45,208
You see, I was psychic.

127
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:47,004
Here, granny.

128
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:50,921
Thanks. The cold doesn't do
granny's eyes much good.

129
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:53,805
Thank you.

130
00:12:54,012 --> 00:12:58,642
- Did you get anything?
- Yes, I got some.

131
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:12,367
Granny, why don't I have a father
like all the other children?

132
00:13:15,012 --> 00:13:18,891
If you'd had a real father, -

133
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:21,560
- someone worthwhile, -

134
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:26,209
- Sørine would sit as a married woman
on the Sandfarm.

135
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:28,846
And we ...

136
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:33,364
Starve and freeze,
that we wouldn't.

137
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:37,927
Let me help you, granny.

138
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:40,566
I'll show you.

139
00:13:46,012 --> 00:13:50,449
- We're still doing alright.
- Yes, we are.

140
00:14:00,852 --> 00:14:03,924
Sun, show yourself,
cloud, go away, -

141
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:06,088
- and sun ...

142
00:14:17,612 --> 00:14:19,489
Granny, granny!

143
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:26,321
Granny, look what I found!

144
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:31,490
Let no one see that money.
They're the ones granddad got.

145
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:34,047
Save them until you get older.

146
00:14:34,252 --> 00:14:36,846
Tell nobody about them.

147
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:38,963
Then they will take them from us.

148
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:51,485
It’s a fishmonger.
He's coming this way.

149
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:59,765
Am I not bringing you
some lovely weather?

150
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:05,487
Granny's eyes are failing her.

151
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:08,490
But I am your son-in-law.

152
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:11,331
Which girl are you married to?

153
00:15:11,532 --> 00:15:15,207
The one who's the mother of that kid.
What's your name?

154
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:22,523
I am Ditte Love, Ditte Rascal
and Ditte Child of Man.

155
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:27,886
So Sørine has married? 

156
00:15:28,092 --> 00:15:31,243
It isn't quite official yet.

157
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:34,762
We haven't bothered
the priest yet.

158
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:42,490
- And what's your name?
- Lars Peter Hansen.

159
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,842
They call me the scavenger.

160
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:47,646
I hawk herrings, as you see, -

161
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:51,162
- and buy rags and bones
when people have any.

162
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:54,045
- That won't get you much.
- No.

163
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:58,768
People wear out their rags
and walk their bones to stumps.

164
00:15:58,972 --> 00:16:01,167
But one has to sell something.

165
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:04,921
Yes, one has to eat.

166
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:08,440
Thank you.

167
00:16:08,652 --> 00:16:11,610
Don't you need a bit of something?
Come here.

168
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:14,201
Tell the baker
that we have a visitor, -

169
00:16:14,412 --> 00:16:18,690
- and that you need the bread
that we were having next week.

170
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:24,246
Can you keep her in check?

171
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:26,886
I have no one else
to support me, -

172
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:30,562
- but she's just a kid,
and I'm old and bothersome.

173
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:34,651
That's what I’ve
come to talk to you about.

174
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:37,889
You haven't come
to take away the girl?

175
00:16:38,092 --> 00:16:42,449
No. It’s just that since
Sørine and I are getting married, -

176
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:45,246
- I’ve come to bring you
to the church.

177
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:48,683
That is, if you don't want to
move in with us.

178
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:53,443
- Sørine told you to say that?
- No. Well, yes ...

179
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:58,089
I could tell that you made that up
by yourself. I thank you.

180
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:01,602
Now I have a father
like all the other children.

181
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,441
He's at home with granny.
He has his own horse and a cart.

182
00:17:05,652 --> 00:17:10,043
- Oh? And what's his name, then?
- He's called the scavenger.

183
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:16,168
- That means you're of fine blood.
- Yes, he's marrying my mother.

184
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:24,766
So you have
young ones at home?

185
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:29,682
Yes, Sørine is carrying one again.

186
00:17:29,892 --> 00:17:33,851
- Thanks, Ditte.
- You are one skilled girl.

187
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:35,770
You deserve a kiss.

188
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:41,769
Have I hurt you?

189
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:46,841
The child has been looking forward
to getting a father.

190
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:51,603
And now it's come true,
although it's no big thing.

191
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:54,246
The two of us
will make great friends.

192
00:17:54,452 --> 00:17:58,684
At Whitsun I will bring
you and granny to the wedding.

193
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:03,363
When the Whitsun bells are ringing,
I will come to you.

194
00:18:12,612 --> 00:18:17,686
- You look so pretty, Ditte.
- Yes, I'm going to the church today.

195
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:22,090
- You are?
- My mum and dad are getting married.

196
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:24,442
Oh?

197
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:36,164
But it's Whitsun.

198
00:18:36,372 --> 00:18:40,047
Don't you think
father will take us the wedding?

199
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,924
Dad will come. I know.

200
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:46,410
Shouldn't you be getting yourself
ready to come along?

201
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:49,524
I'll make it where I have to go.

202
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:57,244
The wedding is off for now.

203
00:18:57,452 --> 00:19:00,250
Sørine wanted to wait a bit longer.

204
00:19:00,452 --> 00:19:05,765
One has long known about
your business here.

205
00:19:05,972 --> 00:19:08,406
You are expected.

206
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:12,842
Go and pack your clothes, Ditte.

207
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:17,250
It’s not my idea, but a mother
has a right to her child, -

208
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:22,162
- and Sørine finds that she's come
to long a tad for the girl.

209
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:27,366
I know that you've argued against it
as much as you could.

210
00:19:28,412 --> 00:19:33,281
Well, everything will be
as it was meant to be.

211
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:37,041
Can't one of your children
come down here to help you?

212
00:19:37,252 --> 00:19:41,006
A mother can feed eight kids, -

213
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:47,526
- but have you ever heard of
eight kids feeding a mother?

214
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:52,248
So, Ditte, did you
remember everything?

215
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:55,125
Yes, I did.

216
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:59,086
Well, then let's have
a look at the vehicle.

217
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:21,047
We are not going to forget you.

218
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:28,289
You're at the first end of things,
as Søren Man said.

219
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:33,646
You have much ahead of you,
young Ditte.

220
00:20:35,972 --> 00:20:38,645
You can have this.

221
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:45,290
- Goodbye, Maren.
- Goodbye, granny.

222
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:47,642
Goodbye, Ditte love.

223
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:17,685
Ditte?
Ditte?

224
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:21,851
- Ditte?
- Ditte?

225
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:27,206
Ditte? Ditte?
Get up, will you.

226
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,767
I'm up, mother.

227
00:21:30,932 --> 00:21:33,969
Get the young ones up and dressed.

228
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:42,322
Dad will be here soon.

229
00:21:42,532 --> 00:21:45,444
- Are we riding with Big Klavs?
- Yes.

230
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:49,290
I want Big Klavs.

231
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:51,642
Kristian, come here!

232
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,286
Else, don't run outside naked.

233
00:21:54,492 --> 00:21:57,131
Kristian and Else!
Get over here.

234
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:06,968
- Kristian, wait for me.
- You need to wear your shirt.

235
00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:24,841
Povl, let Ditte help.

236
00:22:27,172 --> 00:22:32,246
Quiet, children.
Ditte, get them to calm down.

237
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:35,486
It’s dad!

238
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:42,965
Is the coffee done?

239
00:23:04,972 --> 00:23:10,092
Good morning. I have a special
greeting to you from granny.

240
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:14,410
She thanks you for all the coffee
and sugar that we ...

241
00:23:14,612 --> 00:23:19,732
- Is granny still bedridden?
- She always is, they say.

242
00:23:39,652 --> 00:23:43,167
Blame yourself for that back.
You carry that big kid around.

243
00:23:43,372 --> 00:23:45,602
Granny always said that ...

244
00:23:45,812 --> 00:23:48,770
You talk a lot about your granny.

245
00:23:50,132 --> 00:23:53,727
Any news from dad about my mum?

246
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,641
I guess she can't
keep it up much longer.

247
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:04,842
Don't make a fuss.
Old people can't live forever.

248
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:07,247
When granny dies,
we get a new house.

249
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:10,649
No, because granny says
that that money ...

250
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:15,082
What money?

251
00:24:19,132 --> 00:24:20,121
Stupid girl.

252
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:24,041
I know you mean the money
that was paid for you.

253
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:26,243
What's it to be spent on?

254
00:24:26,452 --> 00:24:29,125
Granny hid it.

255
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,570
Oh?

256
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:36,331
Oh?

257
00:24:38,652 --> 00:24:40,927
And where did she hide it?

258
00:24:41,132 --> 00:24:44,204
In the duvet, of course!

259
00:24:45,252 --> 00:24:48,608
- No.
- What a lovely smell of coffee.

260
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:51,849
- I have food for you.
- I have something for you.

261
00:24:52,052 --> 00:24:53,326
And the kids.

262
00:24:53,532 --> 00:24:56,604
- Come, dad.
- Let's see what you've got.

263
00:24:59,172 --> 00:25:01,003
The porridge, Ditte!

264
00:25:03,852 --> 00:25:05,524
That's fine, little wagtail.

265
00:25:05,732 --> 00:25:09,008
Shouldn't Povl sit
in his seat and eat?

266
00:25:12,452 --> 00:25:14,920
Aren't you going to show us?

267
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:16,963
I almost forgot.

268
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:20,005
I think this is
something for the neck.

269
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:24,683
Shouldn't we rather save the money
instead of buying worthless junk?

270
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:29,727
Take a good look at it.
Here's something for the nestlings.

271
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:34,210
Not until after breakfast.
Didn't you hear, Kristian?

272
00:25:34,412 --> 00:25:36,482
I was just looking.

273
00:25:42,492 --> 00:25:44,642
Can I go now?

274
00:25:45,692 --> 00:25:48,252
- Have you fed the chickens?
- Yes.

275
00:25:48,452 --> 00:25:51,125
- But the cow ...
- I'll do it.

276
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:54,404
Let her go,
or she'll be late for school.

277
00:25:54,612 --> 00:25:58,446
Bring the sack,
so you can pick nettles for the pig.

278
00:26:01,652 --> 00:26:03,722
She could be a bit faster.

279
00:26:03,932 --> 00:26:07,083
She spends her time
telling tales about granny.

280
00:26:07,292 --> 00:26:09,044
She longs for her.

281
00:26:09,252 --> 00:26:11,891
I don't see
why she can't stay here.

282
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:15,050
You want us to sleep
in the stables?

283
00:26:16,092 --> 00:26:19,562
Mum has always been
good at taking care of herself.

284
00:26:19,772 --> 00:26:22,240
Can I give one to Povl now?

285
00:26:24,412 --> 00:26:27,245
Get your beaks up, nestlings.

286
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:35,527
Loves me, loves me not.
Loves me, loves me not.

287
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:37,211
Loves me.

288
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:40,927
- You're late again.
- I am? So are you.

289
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,851
- Aren't you going to school?
- We're ill.

290
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:46,691
Well, I have to hurry up.

291
00:26:46,892 --> 00:26:50,282
Why don't your dad drive you
in your neat cart?

292
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:53,245
Dad is so busy.
Would you like a bonbon?

293
00:26:53,452 --> 00:26:55,488
Yes.

294
00:26:56,932 --> 00:26:59,400
Phew, they taste of herring.

295
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:07,689
Loves me, loves me not.
Loves me, loves me not.

296
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:13,205
Loves me, loves me not.
Loves me, loves me not.

297
00:27:21,012 --> 00:27:24,527
- Ditte, I can whistle.
- You can?

298
00:27:24,732 --> 00:27:26,450
- Wanna hear?
- Yes.

299
00:27:26,652 --> 00:27:28,927
That was neat.

300
00:27:29,132 --> 00:27:33,125
- Now, lie down and go to sleep.
- Yes.

301
00:27:39,612 --> 00:27:42,968
I don't know what you have to do
to get to school in time.

302
00:27:43,172 --> 00:27:46,244
What can I do, Kristian?

303
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:50,489
Just turn the clock forward.

304
00:27:57,252 --> 00:27:59,641
What are you doing?

305
00:28:01,692 --> 00:28:04,206
You want to trick your mother?

306
00:28:04,412 --> 00:28:06,289
Out of my way.

307
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:15,369
So you wanted to
trick your mother, you rascal!

308
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:21,450
Come here! I'm going to
teach you a thing or two!

309
00:28:27,212 --> 00:28:29,168
Let go!

310
00:28:43,372 --> 00:28:45,169
Come here, girl.

311
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:52,531
Come here, you dumb girl.
You rascal.

312
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,768
You can cry outside.

313
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:59,762
That'll teach you not to
play tricks on me again!

314
00:29:01,732 --> 00:29:03,211
Granny ...

315
00:29:16,292 --> 00:29:18,044
Granny?

316
00:30:00,052 --> 00:30:02,566
What is it, Big Klavs?

317
00:30:02,772 --> 00:30:05,047
What is it?

318
00:30:11,932 --> 00:30:13,968
Ditte?

319
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:40,920
It’s late, Lars Peter.

320
00:31:03,852 --> 00:31:05,604
Yes, you watch us.

321
00:31:05,812 --> 00:31:09,725
There is a child here
who accuses you.

322
00:31:18,692 --> 00:31:21,809
What are we to do about this?

323
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:24,480
You don't mind laying it on.

324
00:31:24,692 --> 00:31:29,607
Now, let's see if you are
just as good at making it go away.

325
00:31:29,812 --> 00:31:34,567
Come here.
Kiss Ditte where you hit her.

326
00:31:34,772 --> 00:31:39,288
One kiss for each blow.

327
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,892
Well?

328
00:31:43,092 --> 00:31:46,528
So you think your mouth
is too good for kissing -

329
00:31:46,732 --> 00:31:48,529
- what your hand hit?

330
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:50,484
- No!
- Well?

331
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,444
Mum ...

332
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:19,128
My bloodline is not in high regard,
and we may not deserve it either, -

333
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:22,881
- but they never laid hand
on us children.

334
00:32:23,932 --> 00:32:27,049
These hands have done much work -

335
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:30,164
- but never been turned against
the defenceless.

336
00:32:30,372 --> 00:32:33,887
I'd advice you
to give that some thought.

337
00:32:50,772 --> 00:32:52,922
Say, Lars Peter?

338
00:32:57,732 --> 00:32:59,450
You know what?

339
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:03,850
I think my mother has sewn
the money into the duvet.

340
00:33:05,932 --> 00:33:10,403
- What money?
- The money dad got from the farmer.

341
00:33:10,612 --> 00:33:13,126
They're none of our business.

342
00:33:13,332 --> 00:33:17,211
They were given to the girl
who is now a burden to us.

343
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:21,644
We could build for that money.
A new farmhouse.

344
00:33:23,492 --> 00:33:25,130
Are you asleep?

345
00:33:27,932 --> 00:33:30,048
Say, Lars Peter?

346
00:33:30,252 --> 00:33:34,086
I have a feeling
that my mother will soon die.

347
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,408
Go and talk to her.

348
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:40,844
We probably have to
earn the money that we need.

349
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:43,930
What can we earn?
You toil and moil.

350
00:33:44,132 --> 00:33:48,125
- And we get nowhere.
- Are you sure about this?

351
00:33:48,332 --> 00:33:53,531
Do you know why people
call this the "magpie's nest"?

352
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:58,601
Because nothing go our way.
People consider us as nothing.

353
00:33:58,812 --> 00:34:01,724
But I will show them.

354
00:34:01,932 --> 00:34:06,005
If you won't talk to my mother,
I will go there.

355
00:34:06,212 --> 00:34:09,602
And I won't be coming back
without the duvet.

356
00:34:25,692 --> 00:34:28,411
Maybe Ditte
can tell us about that?

357
00:34:28,612 --> 00:34:30,728
Yes?

358
00:34:30,932 --> 00:34:33,446
You have to pay more attention.

359
00:34:33,652 --> 00:34:35,927
Then Hans can tell us.

360
00:34:36,132 --> 00:34:39,602
Where are you, Ditte?

361
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:43,361
Ditte?
Ditte, love?

362
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:47,410
I want that duvet!
I have a right to have it!

363
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:51,890
I won't let you have it, Sørine.
Now, leave me alone.

364
00:35:53,372 --> 00:35:56,603
- Leave me alone!
- I'm taking it with me!

365
00:35:58,412 --> 00:36:00,528
You have the money in it.

366
00:36:00,732 --> 00:36:04,202
- What money?
- Don't you think I know?

367
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:12,202
Those are my money!
And I want it!

368
00:36:12,412 --> 00:36:14,050
I'll cry out.

369
00:36:14,252 --> 00:36:17,085
Sure, cry out.

370
00:36:19,132 --> 00:36:21,441
No one will hear you.

371
00:36:21,652 --> 00:36:24,325
They must be in there.

372
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:27,365
Be quiet, you thief.

373
00:36:28,412 --> 00:36:29,811
Help!

374
00:36:30,012 --> 00:36:33,721
What are you saying?
What are you saying?!

375
00:36:42,012 --> 00:36:44,048
Granny!

376
00:37:09,532 --> 00:37:12,524
Good evening, Sørine.

377
00:37:13,572 --> 00:37:15,847
Good evening.

378
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:27,451
Granny, can't you hear me?

379
00:37:28,492 --> 00:37:32,963
Granny, it's me. Ditte.

380
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:37,609
What happened? I heard
Maren knock, but I'm bedridden.

381
00:37:37,812 --> 00:37:41,885
Oh, this is a fine mess.

382
00:37:42,092 --> 00:37:44,845
Come, Ditte.

383
00:37:45,052 --> 00:37:49,648
Who has been here?
What happened?

384
00:37:50,692 --> 00:37:53,525
Poor Ditte.

385
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,526
Lars Peter!
Lars Peter!

386
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:09,844
Oh, this is a fine mess.

387
00:38:13,212 --> 00:38:15,851
Now old Maren has died.

388
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:22,002
But it seems to me that it
didn't happen naturally.

389
00:38:22,212 --> 00:38:24,931
Poor Ditte.

390
00:38:25,132 --> 00:38:26,724
She was here.

391
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:31,050
Yes, and Sørine.

392
00:38:42,212 --> 00:38:44,407
Hello?

393
00:38:46,412 --> 00:38:49,722
- Ditte?
- Ditte?

394
00:38:49,932 --> 00:38:53,322
I'll run to the highway again
and look for her.

395
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,363
Bring the lantern.

396
00:38:56,732 --> 00:39:00,088
Here, Else.
Do you want one, too, Povl?

397
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:02,522
Yes, a big one.

398
00:39:02,732 --> 00:39:06,281
Sugared bread?
You're having an early Sunday.

399
00:39:06,492 --> 00:39:09,484
They've been good
while mother was away.

400
00:39:09,692 --> 00:39:12,809
- Goodnight, dad.
- Goodnight, kids.

401
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,888
Where is that girl?

402
00:39:16,092 --> 00:39:18,970
You haven't had a row,
have you?

403
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:21,811
Nothing, Lars Peter.
Nothing.

404
00:39:22,012 --> 00:39:24,685
- We're doing so well now.
- Sure we are.

405
00:39:24,892 --> 00:39:28,043
And I'm happy about that.

406
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:35,281
I think it will be alright
if granny comes to live with us.

407
00:39:35,492 --> 00:39:38,245
She probably ran down to her.

408
00:39:38,452 --> 00:39:41,842
You really light up
when you smile, Sørine.

409
00:39:43,012 --> 00:39:45,003
Did granny feel better?

410
00:39:45,212 --> 00:39:48,488
Yes, much better.

411
00:39:48,692 --> 00:39:54,369
- Did you give her any food?
- Yes, she slept alright when ...

412
00:39:56,412 --> 00:40:00,405
There you are.
We've missed you so much.

413
00:40:00,612 --> 00:40:02,489
Come, Ditte.

414
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:06,526
Dear me, girl.
Mum only wanted to ...

415
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:10,884
You're shaking.
Come, I have some food for you.

416
00:40:11,092 --> 00:40:14,721
Give her a cup of coffee instead.
That's what she gave granny -

417
00:40:14,932 --> 00:40:17,492
- when she was cold.

418
00:40:20,172 --> 00:40:23,801
I ... I feel so queasy.

419
00:40:24,012 --> 00:40:28,483
Ditte?
What's wrong with the girl?

420
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:31,809
It must be something she ate.

421
00:40:34,292 --> 00:40:38,285
If I only knew ...

422
00:40:38,492 --> 00:40:41,848
- If I only knew ...
- Knew what?

423
00:40:42,052 --> 00:40:44,122
Nothing. Nothing.

424
00:40:44,332 --> 00:40:46,926
You're tired after the trip.

425
00:40:47,132 --> 00:40:50,283
Yes, I guess I am.

426
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:56,482
I think I'll clear the table.

427
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:04,405
Ditte?

428
00:41:09,012 --> 00:41:10,650
Ditte?

429
00:41:10,852 --> 00:41:13,525
Ditte, love.

430
00:41:15,012 --> 00:41:18,368
Ditte? Where are you?

431
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:22,209
Ditte?

432
00:41:52,252 --> 00:41:54,812
No! No!

433
00:41:55,292 --> 00:41:57,123
Mum!

434
00:41:57,332 --> 00:42:00,563
- Lars Peter! Lars Peter!
- Come on!

435
00:42:00,772 --> 00:42:02,842
No, I won't! Let go!

436
00:42:03,052 --> 00:42:05,964
- Ditte! Help me!
- Do you belong here?

437
00:42:06,172 --> 00:42:10,484
Go and tell your siblings
not to be afraid.

438
00:42:10,692 --> 00:42:13,331
- Shall we get going?
- Ditte! Ditte!

439
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:17,730
- Ditte! Ditte!
- There!

440
00:42:21,492 --> 00:42:24,404
Lars Peter.

441
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:27,568
Lars Peter.

442
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:34,610
Mum! Mum!

443
00:42:38,132 --> 00:42:41,204
- Mum!
- There's dad!

444
00:42:50,532 --> 00:42:53,171
So, we've had visitors.

445
00:42:55,412 --> 00:42:58,165
What's the matter, children?

446
00:43:00,172 --> 00:43:02,208
The police came for Sørine.

447
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:05,768
For Sørine?

448
00:43:05,972 --> 00:43:08,247
Came for her?

449
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:11,364
It must be some misunderstanding.

450
00:43:11,572 --> 00:43:14,086
That can't be right.

451
00:43:16,572 --> 00:43:19,291
You were there
when it happened.

452
00:43:19,492 --> 00:43:22,325
You've got to know ...

453
00:43:22,532 --> 00:43:26,002
You have to be able to
vouch for your mother.

454
00:43:50,492 --> 00:43:52,847
Shall we go?

455
00:44:32,132 --> 00:44:35,568
Do you need anything
honed, riveted or soldered?

456
00:44:35,772 --> 00:44:38,605
I hone knives, scissors
and what have you.

457
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:41,963
I'll cut your corns
and suck up to your woman.

458
00:44:42,172 --> 00:44:44,925
I'm the knife-grinder!
Where's the mistress?

459
00:44:45,132 --> 00:44:47,282
- That's me.
- What?

460
00:44:47,492 --> 00:44:51,121
- And how may I serve you?
- I have a dull pair of scissors.

461
00:44:58,212 --> 00:45:02,091
- Where do you come from?
- From Spainland.

462
00:45:02,292 --> 00:45:07,002
From Spainland?
That's what dad always answered.

463
00:45:07,212 --> 00:45:10,409
Are you from Odsherred,
if I may ask?

464
00:45:10,612 --> 00:45:14,287
Then maybe you could
tell me about an Arnst Hansen?

465
00:45:14,492 --> 00:45:17,768
- Goes by the name of the scavenger.
- That I can.

466
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:20,247
Because that's my dad.

467
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:24,923
It is? Then I will have to
bid you welcome.

468
00:45:25,132 --> 00:45:28,169
For then you are Johannes,
my brother.

469
00:45:28,372 --> 00:45:33,651
I'm Lars Peter.
So, this is what you look like now.

470
00:45:33,852 --> 00:45:36,969
I haven't seen you
since you ran away from home.

471
00:45:37,172 --> 00:45:38,969
You look like mum.

472
00:45:39,172 --> 00:45:42,881
Ditte, can you go inside
and make us something nice?

473
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:44,923
Come on in.

474
00:45:45,972 --> 00:45:48,486
You're the spitting image of mum.

475
00:45:57,172 --> 00:46:00,448
You're the first guest
in the Magpie's nest since ...

476
00:46:00,652 --> 00:46:03,610
Well, since a long time ago, so ...

477
00:46:09,812 --> 00:46:12,167
- Here, nestlings.
- Have some.

478
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:15,682
- We can take afterwards.
- Ditte? Come over here.

479
00:46:18,332 --> 00:46:23,406
- Does your peat bog yield anything?
- Nothing more than we use ourselves.

480
00:46:23,612 --> 00:46:26,365
We could sell a lot of peats.

481
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:29,769
If only you have something to sell.

482
00:46:35,132 --> 00:46:38,522
Now I know how he does it.
Put your foot there, and I'll pull.

483
00:46:38,732 --> 00:46:40,609
Go ahead.

484
00:46:51,732 --> 00:46:55,566
she bumps into a little prince

485
00:46:55,772 --> 00:46:59,287
in scarlet clad

486
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:15,761
That's it, right?

487
00:47:15,972 --> 00:47:19,248
- Yes!
- One more time!

488
00:47:22,012 --> 00:47:25,527
Give uncle some peace now
and go to bed.

489
00:47:25,732 --> 00:47:28,451
This could become
one fine house -

490
00:47:28,652 --> 00:47:30,722
- once we get to work.

491
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:33,571
And Ditte makes the best food.

492
00:47:33,772 --> 00:47:36,332
- Cheers, fair maiden.
- Cheers.

493
00:47:39,572 --> 00:47:42,370
And for the elderly gentleman.

494
00:47:46,772 --> 00:47:49,161
There you go, uncle.

495
00:47:51,212 --> 00:47:53,203
Cheers, brother.

496
00:47:54,212 --> 00:47:56,965
And thank you
for helping us out.

497
00:47:57,172 --> 00:48:00,801
Sørine will be in jail for
quite some time, -

498
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:05,369
- and I travel the roads so much.
Hawking herring and rags.

499
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,242
I know of another trade.

500
00:48:11,212 --> 00:48:14,966
- Have you got money?
- A little. For mortgage.

501
00:48:15,172 --> 00:48:19,802
Give it to me.
If you have money, then ...

502
00:48:20,012 --> 00:48:23,322
I will make things happen.
Can you scrape guts?

503
00:48:23,532 --> 00:48:26,171
- Uncle wants to slaughter?
- Certainly.

504
00:48:26,372 --> 00:48:29,728
But we were supposed to
get the land into shape.

505
00:48:31,052 --> 00:48:33,805
Have you forgotten your trade?

506
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:35,843
- Trade?
- Yes.

507
00:48:36,052 --> 00:48:39,806
Those thick-headed farmers
don't use their carcasses.

508
00:48:40,012 --> 00:48:42,082
I don't slaughter cadavers.

509
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:45,568
But I do. You just wait, -

510
00:48:45,772 --> 00:48:47,842
- and I'll show you money.

511
00:50:33,012 --> 00:50:37,369
Kristian, go and get dad.
He's in the peat bog. Hurry up!

512
00:50:40,252 --> 00:50:42,527
Damned creature.

513
00:50:55,412 --> 00:50:57,846
Dad? Have a look at Big Klavs.

514
00:50:58,052 --> 00:50:59,963
I'll have a look at him.

515
00:51:00,172 --> 00:51:03,289
He needs some love and affection.

516
00:51:03,492 --> 00:51:05,244
Don't touch him.

517
00:51:23,452 --> 00:51:26,205
- Are you mad?
- Go to hell.

518
00:51:48,292 --> 00:51:49,327
Let go!

519
00:52:17,052 --> 00:52:21,091
I suppose you understand
that you're through here.

520
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:25,490
People who hit animals
have no business here.

521
00:52:25,692 --> 00:52:27,922
We saw something good in you.

522
00:52:28,132 --> 00:52:30,726
We're not overrun by
family and friends, -

523
00:52:30,932 --> 00:52:34,527
- so you could easily have found
your way in through good.

524
00:52:34,732 --> 00:52:36,848
And what did you bring us?

525
00:52:37,052 --> 00:52:41,568
Evil and filth.

526
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:48,730
Where are the money that you were
supposed to buy a peat cutter for?

527
00:53:21,652 --> 00:53:23,961
- What's this?
- A dead rat.

528
00:53:24,172 --> 00:53:27,084
- What are we to do with it?
- Give it to me.

529
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:30,125
Kristian.
I have something for you.

530
00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:35,484
Here's some nice, fresh meat
for sausages.

531
00:53:35,692 --> 00:53:38,160
Isn't it good enough for you?

532
00:53:40,012 --> 00:53:43,607
- So you want to fight, you rascal?
- Don't you touch him!

533
00:53:43,812 --> 00:53:45,564
Beware of the magpie.

534
00:53:45,772 --> 00:53:48,491
Yes, she's learnt from her mother.

535
00:53:57,572 --> 00:54:00,325
You forgot your shoe!

536
00:54:01,132 --> 00:54:04,841
Cowardly kids.
Say hi from me in the magpie's nest.

537
00:54:09,212 --> 00:54:11,442
- 1 .7 5.
- 2.00.

538
00:54:11,652 --> 00:54:14,166
That's nothing for
a watch like that.

539
00:54:14,372 --> 00:54:17,250
Wouldn't that be something
for the wife?

540
00:54:17,452 --> 00:54:19,682
- Let's hear it.
- Three.

541
00:54:19,892 --> 00:54:23,931
Three kroner.
Sold for that princely bid.

542
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:26,965
Three kroner bid by
Jens Peter Jensen.

543
00:54:27,172 --> 00:54:30,721
And here is a fine comb.

544
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:33,930
Ten kroner?

545
00:54:34,132 --> 00:54:37,522
- No, four.
- Four and a quarter.

546
00:54:39,612 --> 00:54:42,684
Is it far to America?
I'd rather live there.

547
00:54:42,892 --> 00:54:45,247
Nobody will know us there.

548
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:47,568
Or know about mum.

549
00:54:47,772 --> 00:54:51,401
Is this also up for sale?

550
00:54:51,612 --> 00:54:54,490
No, it's still too early.

551
00:55:06,532 --> 00:55:10,491
Is nobody going to
make a bid on this?

552
00:55:10,692 --> 00:55:12,922
One kroner.

553
00:55:13,132 --> 00:55:16,647
- You will be paying cash, right?
- Yes.

554
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:24,720
He can get the money from me.

555
00:55:32,572 --> 00:55:34,722
- Ten kroner.
- Four.

556
00:55:34,932 --> 00:55:36,923
Four and a quarter.

557
00:55:48,652 --> 00:55:51,724
It’s made from carcasses.

558
00:56:05,212 --> 00:56:07,043
What's wrong?

559
00:56:07,252 --> 00:56:10,483
They're not eating anything.

560
00:56:10,692 --> 00:56:12,569
They can't be hungry.

561
00:56:12,772 --> 00:56:14,603
They think it isn't edible.

562
00:56:14,812 --> 00:56:17,280
That it's some of what uncle made.

563
00:56:17,492 --> 00:56:21,724
- Dog's meat or something.
- Nonsense.

564
00:56:21,932 --> 00:56:25,720
I'm looking forward to
moving some place with people.

565
00:56:25,932 --> 00:56:29,686
- People?
- Yes, real people.

566
00:56:29,892 --> 00:56:32,326
Like Kristian and Else and ...

567
00:56:32,532 --> 00:56:33,931
And me.

568
00:56:38,452 --> 00:56:41,046
What's this worth?
Ten kroner?

569
00:56:41,252 --> 00:56:45,245
Now we'll rest a bit
and get something in our stomachs.

570
00:56:49,212 --> 00:56:51,203
Let me do it.

571
00:56:57,572 --> 00:56:59,164
Let me just say -

572
00:56:59,372 --> 00:57:02,489
- that if the clerk
and the assistant would care, -

573
00:57:02,692 --> 00:57:05,968
- there's food and beer
in the living room.

574
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:12,042
We can also offer you a schnapps.
Ditte has taken care of that.

575
00:57:12,252 --> 00:57:17,326
To think that he invites
public authorities to his table.

576
00:57:17,532 --> 00:57:20,888
And in the house of
the murderess, no less.

577
00:57:24,252 --> 00:57:27,642
Thank you, but we brought
our own food.

578
00:57:27,852 --> 00:57:32,482
And you and your little girl
have plenty to do already.

579
00:57:47,492 --> 00:57:50,404
Yes.

580
00:57:50,652 --> 00:57:52,404
Thank you.

581
00:57:52,612 --> 00:57:55,251
Other people's food is always tasty.

582
00:57:55,452 --> 00:57:58,967
And some schnapps for the food.
How about you?

583
00:58:17,612 --> 00:58:19,603
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

584
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:26,161
I haven't had open-faced sandwiches
like this before.

585
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:29,921
You have a fine daughter,
Lars Peter Hansen.

586
00:58:32,772 --> 00:58:37,243
- Would you like another one?
- Yes, please.

587
00:58:48,332 --> 00:58:51,244
- Kristian, can you take Povl?
- Yes.

588
00:59:11,492 --> 00:59:13,448
Here, Big Klavs.

589
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:19,130
Pers! Pers!

590
00:59:19,332 --> 00:59:23,120
Yes, we almost forgot him.
Could you get him, Kristian?

591
00:59:23,332 --> 00:59:24,890
Pers! Pers!

592
00:59:25,932 --> 00:59:28,651
- Are you comfortable?
- Yes, Ditte.

593
00:59:32,732 --> 00:59:36,725
One has started over a few times.

594
00:59:36,932 --> 00:59:38,285
But this time ...

595
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:43,008
The kind innkeeper promised to
help you with the house and the boat.

596
00:59:43,212 --> 00:59:45,885
We'll see how kind he is.

597
00:59:46,092 --> 00:59:49,528
- I have him now, dad.
- Come on, Big Klavs.

598
00:59:49,732 --> 00:59:51,927
Let's move out, Pers.

599
01:00:31,052 --> 01:00:34,408
- It’s the innkeeper!
- The cannibal!

600
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:53,486
"And help me
to be dead while I'm alive."

601
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:56,411
"Dead while I'm alive"?

602
01:00:58,052 --> 01:01:03,206
"From sin and shame and vice
that will ....

603
01:01:03,412 --> 01:01:06,245
... that will for death suffice."

604
01:01:09,252 --> 01:01:14,201
One managed to pay fare on
one of the innkeeper's boats.

605
01:01:14,412 --> 01:01:18,883
It cost us everything
that remained from the auction.

606
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:21,765
I can't become confirmed.

607
01:01:21,972 --> 01:01:24,088
What do you mean?

608
01:01:24,292 --> 01:01:27,568
I won't have time to learn it all.
The priest says -

609
01:01:27,772 --> 01:01:31,208
- that he won't dare
place me before the Lord.

610
01:01:31,412 --> 01:01:33,528
Won't dare?

611
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:37,805
You could be the Lord's housekeeper
if you so desired.

612
01:01:39,052 --> 01:01:40,644
I want to be confirmed.

613
01:01:40,852 --> 01:01:44,970
I won't start over again and have
people sneer at me every day.

614
01:01:45,172 --> 01:01:50,883
Maybe the priest can be greased.
But the innkeeper has all our money.

615
01:01:51,092 --> 01:01:53,401
The innkeeper can fix it.

616
01:01:53,612 --> 01:01:57,730
There's nothing in this village
that he can't fix.

617
01:01:57,932 --> 01:02:02,164
Who says you can't
become confirmed, Ditte?

618
01:02:02,372 --> 01:02:04,761
- The priest.
- Oh, him?

619
01:02:06,812 --> 01:02:09,963
I'll take care of him.

620
01:02:12,412 --> 01:02:17,964
And when you're done, I have an
opening for you on the Hillfarm.

621
01:02:18,172 --> 01:02:23,292
- That is, if you want it.
- If you can get me an interview ...

622
01:02:23,492 --> 01:02:25,801
We can't do without her.

623
01:02:26,012 --> 01:02:28,480
You squander your sugar.

624
01:02:28,692 --> 01:02:31,081
Those girls are too expensive -

625
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:33,886
- when they're not earning money.

626
01:02:34,092 --> 01:02:39,166
You poor people ought to economize.
Be content with what you get.

627
01:02:39,372 --> 01:02:44,162
We owe no one thanks
for what little we have.

628
01:02:45,212 --> 01:02:48,090
We would be doomed without Ditte.

629
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:52,251
You don't have to
do without a housewife.

630
01:02:55,052 --> 01:02:58,203
I have a mind to
getting you married again.

631
01:02:58,412 --> 01:03:01,609
My wife is good enough for me.

632
01:03:01,812 --> 01:03:05,202
But she is in prison.

633
01:03:05,412 --> 01:03:09,007
And you have no obligation
to live with a convict.

634
01:03:09,212 --> 01:03:12,648
There will be
no divorces in this home!

635
01:03:12,852 --> 01:03:15,446
Sure, Lars Peter.

636
01:03:15,652 --> 01:03:19,281
That's up to your conscience.

637
01:03:19,492 --> 01:03:25,761
But the word of God says nothing
about sharing your bed or table -

638
01:03:25,972 --> 01:03:28,088
- with a murderess.

639
01:03:28,292 --> 01:03:32,080
I will never abandon Sørine!

640
01:03:32,292 --> 01:03:37,764
- And now you know.
- Well, easy does it.

641
01:03:39,412 --> 01:03:42,927
It’s agreed, then,
that Ditte starts at the Hillfarm -

642
01:03:43,132 --> 01:03:45,771
- once she has been confirmed.

643
01:03:47,252 --> 01:03:51,165
Confirmand, give us a coin.
Confirmand, give us a coin.

644
01:03:51,372 --> 01:03:56,207
Confirmand, give us a coin.
Confirmand, give us a coin.

645
01:03:56,412 --> 01:03:59,722
Four øre.
And I wanted a pocket knife.

646
01:04:01,332 --> 01:04:06,247
- Would you care to write in it?
- Of course. It’s a keepsake.

647
01:04:06,452 --> 01:04:09,728
I’ve never had my picture taken.
Have you?

648
01:04:09,932 --> 01:04:11,968
Yes, plenty of times.

649
01:04:12,172 --> 01:04:13,571
- Here.
- Thanks.

650
01:04:13,772 --> 01:04:14,807
- Bye.
- Bye.

651
01:04:15,012 --> 01:04:18,243
- Congratulations, Ditte.
- Thank you.

652
01:04:19,452 --> 01:04:24,810
Confirmand, give us a coin.
Confirmand, give us a coin.

653
01:04:27,772 --> 01:04:30,047
Each thing has its place.

654
01:04:30,252 --> 01:04:32,720
That makes it much easier for you.

655
01:04:32,932 --> 01:04:35,162
I have to fix this.

656
01:04:38,852 --> 01:04:41,889
- We're going to miss you.
- Yes, you are.

657
01:04:42,092 --> 01:04:44,447
Kristian, now you are the oldest.

658
01:04:44,652 --> 01:04:48,531
Povl and Else only have you
to look up to now.

659
01:04:48,732 --> 01:04:52,441
I'll bloody well take ...
I'll take care of them.

660
01:04:55,292 --> 01:04:57,123
Is it from Sørine?

661
01:04:57,332 --> 01:05:00,324
I can't quite read the last part.

662
01:05:00,532 --> 01:05:05,890
- When is she getting out?
- In about a year from now.

663
01:05:06,092 --> 01:05:10,529
- Do you long for her as well?
- Just read it, Kristian.

664
01:05:10,732 --> 01:05:13,292
Do you think she's changed?

665
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:19,249
In regard to the little ones?
Privation is a good teacher.

666
01:05:21,452 --> 01:05:26,731
You can always return to your home
if they chase you from the farm.

667
01:05:26,932 --> 01:05:32,882
But don't you leave prematurely.
Accept the injustice done to you.

668
01:05:33,092 --> 01:05:35,890
Ought one not
stand up for one's right?

669
01:05:37,772 --> 01:05:40,445
Yes, I suppose one ought to.

670
01:05:40,652 --> 01:05:42,688
But what is right?

671
01:05:42,892 --> 01:05:48,250
The one who has the power
will also be right.

672
01:05:48,452 --> 01:05:51,489
Here are the scissors.

673
01:05:51,692 --> 01:05:54,843
Should I just tell them
that I'm the new girl?

674
01:05:55,052 --> 01:05:57,361
First of all you should say "hello".

675
01:05:57,572 --> 01:06:00,484
Otherwise they'll think
you're rude.

676
01:06:00,692 --> 01:06:03,047
I wonder what the wife will say?

677
01:06:03,252 --> 01:06:07,962
I suppose she'll say:
"Hello and welcome, Ditte."

678
01:06:54,852 --> 01:06:56,649
Hello.

679
01:06:59,252 --> 01:07:00,480
Hello.

680
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:06,565
So you're the scavenger's daughter.

681
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,922
You look a bit stump-tailed.

682
01:07:09,132 --> 01:07:11,566
You won't take up much room.

683
01:07:16,572 --> 01:07:20,645
It’s for the rats.
Flour mixed with plaster.

684
01:07:20,852 --> 01:07:23,412
Bring some of them to the barn.

685
01:07:23,612 --> 01:07:26,445
- Is it very poisonous?
- No.

686
01:07:26,652 --> 01:07:31,601
But as soon as the rats eat
that dry fare, they have to drink.

687
01:07:31,812 --> 01:07:34,884
When plaster gets wet it hardens.

688
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:38,004
It’s like a rock in their stomach.

689
01:07:38,212 --> 01:07:42,171
- That must me a terrible death.
- Why ever?

690
01:07:42,372 --> 01:07:46,729
There are so many ways of dying.
They all lead down the same road.

691
01:07:49,372 --> 01:07:53,524
By the way, when do you expect
your mum to get out?

692
01:07:53,732 --> 01:07:58,123
That ... will probably be a while.

693
01:07:59,172 --> 01:08:02,084
- Do you think she got the money?
- I don't know.

694
01:08:02,292 --> 01:08:05,204
Shouldn't I go place the parcels?

695
01:08:06,612 --> 01:08:08,489
Where were you last night?

696
01:08:08,692 --> 01:08:12,480
You're certainly in heat,
aren't you?

697
01:08:12,692 --> 01:08:14,842
I was with the church brothers.

698
01:08:15,052 --> 01:08:18,806
That's my son.
He'll be managing this farm one day.

699
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,480
However he'll cope with that.

700
01:08:21,692 --> 01:08:24,081
- Mother ...
- Hello.

701
01:08:27,212 --> 01:08:30,204
Now get lost,
and call for the farm hand.

702
01:08:30,412 --> 01:08:33,484
- He's taking a nap in the barn.
- I will.

703
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:35,842
You can't yell him awake.

704
01:08:36,052 --> 01:08:40,409
You have to crawl up into the hay
with him and give him a shake.

705
01:08:40,612 --> 01:08:44,002
Take care that he doesn't
tear off your angel wings.

706
01:08:45,972 --> 01:08:49,601
It suits them well
to have their bud nipped in time.

707
01:08:58,852 --> 01:09:01,730
One virgin helps another.

708
01:09:01,932 --> 01:09:04,048
Those girls.

709
01:09:51,892 --> 01:09:54,281
Ditte?
Ditte?

710
01:09:55,092 --> 01:09:56,844
Ditte?

711
01:10:07,372 --> 01:10:10,648
- Ditte?
- Yes, I'm right here.

712
01:10:12,092 --> 01:10:16,643
- One of the cows was in the field.
- I'm sorry.

713
01:10:16,852 --> 01:10:19,320
- I'll get it right away.
- I fixed it.

714
01:10:19,532 --> 01:10:21,887
Thank you.

715
01:10:26,852 --> 01:10:31,607
- It’s a good thing mum didn't see.
- You're afraid of your mum, right?

716
01:10:34,252 --> 01:10:36,720
Did you like your dad?

717
01:10:37,772 --> 01:10:40,206
Yes.

718
01:10:42,252 --> 01:10:44,561
I liked him.

719
01:10:46,612 --> 01:10:50,685
He was always in bed.
He was consumptive. He spat blood.

720
01:10:50,892 --> 01:10:53,486
But mum sat on his bed
and smoked, -

721
01:10:53,692 --> 01:10:57,321
- so the blood and the coughing
almost choked him.

722
01:11:00,292 --> 01:11:01,964
I don't like my mum either.

723
01:11:02,172 --> 01:11:05,244
But you're commanded
to love your parents.

724
01:11:05,452 --> 01:11:08,842
Not if you can't like them.
You don't like your mother.

725
01:11:09,052 --> 01:11:11,247
How will you do it, then?

726
01:11:11,452 --> 01:11:14,967
I don't know,
but that's what the book says.

727
01:11:21,332 --> 01:11:24,290
Is your mum cruel to
your dad as well?

728
01:11:24,492 --> 01:11:29,282
No one can harm my dad.
He takes everything like the Lord.

729
01:11:29,492 --> 01:11:31,005
In good spirits.

730
01:11:31,212 --> 01:11:33,726
Don't compare a man to the Lord.

731
01:11:33,932 --> 01:11:38,084
I will when it comes to dad.
And my granny.

732
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:40,760
You're no priest either.

733
01:11:40,972 --> 01:11:43,805
Just be happy mum didn't
see that cow in the field.

734
01:11:44,012 --> 01:11:47,641
- Won't you tell your mother?
- No, why would l?

735
01:11:47,852 --> 01:11:49,444
No, indeed.

736
01:11:49,652 --> 01:11:52,041
But you'll inherit the farm.

737
01:11:52,252 --> 01:11:54,686
Sure.

738
01:11:56,692 --> 01:12:00,082
- Would you like to have these?
- Yes.

739
01:12:00,292 --> 01:12:03,841
- They're pigeon's feathers.
- Thank you.

740
01:12:28,732 --> 01:12:31,724
Ditte? Ditte?

741
01:12:32,772 --> 01:12:36,367
Ditte? Ditte?

742
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:42,002
Kristian, dear,
you must have run all day.

743
01:12:42,212 --> 01:12:44,567
- Did you shirk school?
- No.

744
01:12:44,772 --> 01:12:47,570
How are they back home?
Does Povl ask for me?

745
01:12:47,772 --> 01:12:51,367
- What's this?
- It’s my nest.

746
01:12:51,572 --> 01:12:55,611
You should make
a hidden entrance instead.

747
01:12:55,812 --> 01:13:00,522
- How is Else handling it at home?
- Fine. They're dove's feathers.

748
01:13:00,732 --> 01:13:05,169
- Can I have that lapwing's egg?
- Yes. Is Povl eating properly?

749
01:13:05,372 --> 01:13:09,490
Sure. Let's go to the lake.
That's much more exciting.

750
01:13:09,692 --> 01:13:11,648
Those hillocks are islands.

751
01:13:11,852 --> 01:13:16,164
If you had some poles,
we could build a bridge between them.

752
01:13:16,372 --> 01:13:19,409
- This is so much fun.
- It’s more fun at home.

753
01:13:19,612 --> 01:13:21,887
That's because you're a fool.

754
01:13:22,092 --> 01:13:24,811
Does dad get his beer
when he returns from sea?

755
01:13:25,012 --> 01:13:27,048
Sure.

756
01:13:27,252 --> 01:13:30,688
- Did anyone have some little ones?
- Yes, Martha.

757
01:13:30,892 --> 01:13:33,929
That can't be true.
You're lying.

758
01:13:34,132 --> 01:13:37,124
- Then it's Marie.
- Marie isn't married.

759
01:13:37,332 --> 01:13:40,642
She'll probably have a kid anyway.
There's a magpie.

760
01:13:45,172 --> 01:13:47,561
Didn't anything happen
back home?

761
01:13:47,772 --> 01:13:50,570
Yes, we got a new type of boat.

762
01:13:50,772 --> 01:13:53,491
You have a cut on your heel.
We have to dress that.

763
01:13:53,692 --> 01:13:56,206
I'll just tiptoe.

764
01:13:58,932 --> 01:14:01,241
- Dinner time.
- Where do you eat?

765
01:14:01,452 --> 01:14:03,568
- I run back home.
- Can I come?

766
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:07,128
No, then it'll seem as if
you just came here to eat.

767
01:14:07,332 --> 01:14:08,685
But I did.

768
01:14:08,892 --> 01:14:12,123
Stay here.
I'll bring something out for you.

769
01:14:42,972 --> 01:14:46,089
- So, virgin ...
- I'm up.

770
01:14:48,812 --> 01:14:53,124
Just leave the girl alone, now,
you old man.

771
01:14:53,332 --> 01:14:57,041
It’s no good for her to sleep alone.
She might catch a cold.

772
01:14:57,252 --> 01:15:00,767
I suppose you're still
as cold as a fish.

773
01:15:00,972 --> 01:15:02,803
Colder!

774
01:15:19,212 --> 01:15:22,602
My, now the girl
is off to sea again.

775
01:15:22,812 --> 01:15:26,043
Well, let her.
It won't harm anyone.

776
01:15:26,252 --> 01:15:28,129
She's homesick.

777
01:15:35,892 --> 01:15:38,042
Why do you stand here
every morning?

778
01:15:38,252 --> 01:15:40,720
That's dad's boat out there.

779
01:15:40,932 --> 01:15:42,763
You have good eyes.

780
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:47,523
I just pick one out
that I imagine to be his.

781
01:15:47,732 --> 01:15:50,087
We live behind that headland.

782
01:15:54,132 --> 01:15:57,761
Would you like
to come to a meeting tonight?

783
01:15:58,812 --> 01:16:00,803
Your church brothers
look so pious.

784
01:16:01,012 --> 01:16:05,767
As if they swallowed Maundy Thursday
and are going for Good Friday.

785
01:16:05,972 --> 01:16:08,691
They wanted to help you.

786
01:16:08,892 --> 01:16:12,885
- Because of my mother.
- Yes.

787
01:16:13,092 --> 01:16:15,686
What fault of mine is that?

788
01:16:15,892 --> 01:16:18,850
I haven't got time
to be saved today, -

789
01:16:19,052 --> 01:16:22,010
- because it's my day off.

790
01:16:23,172 --> 01:16:27,211
Are you going home to your dad?

791
01:16:27,412 --> 01:16:30,210
Yes, and my siblings.

792
01:16:30,412 --> 01:16:34,485
I still believe that
the boat out there is my dad's.

793
01:16:45,292 --> 01:16:49,444
- Now we're having visitors.
- Don't we get the day off, then?

794
01:16:49,652 --> 01:16:53,088
We must have the day off.

795
01:16:57,492 --> 01:17:01,565
Does anyone want to sell
beef calf, horses or sucklings?

796
01:17:08,452 --> 01:17:11,125
Well, you hack.

797
01:17:11,332 --> 01:17:14,051
You can't get off until tonight.

798
01:17:14,252 --> 01:17:17,324
Your stock looks properly clean.

799
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:20,968
Well fed and well shaped
at both ends.

800
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:24,526
Like the mistress herself.

801
01:17:27,572 --> 01:17:29,642
Except I'm not for sale.

802
01:17:29,852 --> 01:17:33,242
I usually don't leave
without striking a deal.

803
01:17:33,452 --> 01:17:36,967
But today I’ve got my mind set
on something extra.

804
01:17:40,892 --> 01:17:44,567
We can go up and play
a game of cards over it.

805
01:17:44,772 --> 01:17:47,411
And see who wins.

806
01:17:56,012 --> 01:17:58,287
- What is it?
- I know him.

807
01:17:58,492 --> 01:18:01,609
Indeed, so do I.
The worst of the hawkers.

808
01:18:01,812 --> 01:18:03,803
They bring only misery.

809
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,242
The mistress seemed odd.

810
01:18:06,452 --> 01:18:08,522
She's in the dangerous phase.

811
01:18:08,732 --> 01:18:12,088
- Which is that, Sine?
- She longs for young meat.

812
01:18:12,292 --> 01:18:15,728
Karen Hillfarm can become
almost dizzy when she ...

813
01:18:15,932 --> 01:18:18,162
... when she has a visitor.

814
01:18:24,732 --> 01:18:28,884
I sometimes feel sore all over
and becomes dizzy.

815
01:18:29,092 --> 01:18:34,041
Is that when I'm in that ...
dangerous phase?

816
01:18:34,252 --> 01:18:37,050
That's growing pains.
Don't you mind those.

817
01:18:37,252 --> 01:18:40,483
They only mean that you're
becoming a grown woman.

818
01:18:53,212 --> 01:18:56,727
Hurry up, before the mistress
puts us to more work.

819
01:18:56,932 --> 01:19:00,368
I'm so rich. This is
the first money I’ve earned.

820
01:19:00,572 --> 01:19:04,451
Let's just get going. This won't be
a nice place for us tonight.

821
01:19:04,652 --> 01:19:09,646
I'm going to sleep at home.
I can buy everyone something.

822
01:19:09,852 --> 01:19:13,561
Let's just get going.
Let me just fetch my things.

823
01:19:16,372 --> 01:19:20,365
If she thinks of a reason
why you can't go, I'll help you.

824
01:19:20,572 --> 01:19:24,167
- Thanks, Karl.
- Hurry, Ditte. Come on.

825
01:19:24,372 --> 01:19:29,082
You can't leave. Our guests
are thirsty and want more food.

826
01:19:29,292 --> 01:19:32,762
Their vocal chords got
well-oiled at dinner.

827
01:19:32,972 --> 01:19:36,248
You'd better go on up
and get the guest room in order.

828
01:19:36,452 --> 01:19:39,125
Is he sleeping here tonight?

829
01:19:39,332 --> 01:19:43,769
Yes, if the heir doesn't have
anything against it.

830
01:19:45,772 --> 01:19:49,924
- Today was our day off.
- Put my duvet in the gable room.

831
01:19:50,132 --> 01:19:54,011
We're just so excited.
One gets so nervous.

832
01:19:54,212 --> 01:19:58,125
That's what happens
when you don't find a man in time.

833
01:20:00,612 --> 01:20:04,366
Karl, go and break the necks
on some of your pigeons.

834
01:20:04,572 --> 01:20:07,962
Ditte, fill them with beer.
And don't spill.

835
01:20:08,172 --> 01:20:10,970
Can't we please take chickens?

836
01:20:12,012 --> 01:20:14,526
I asked for pigeons.

837
01:20:15,572 --> 01:20:18,928
And take some
with some meat on them.

838
01:20:56,452 --> 01:20:58,966
Can't someone else kill them?

839
01:20:59,172 --> 01:21:01,402
What a sissy son I have.

840
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:03,648
Let me do it.

841
01:21:05,692 --> 01:21:11,085
Come here, come here,
you innocent, immaculate pigeon.

842
01:21:14,532 --> 01:21:17,808
you're so warm and soft

843
01:21:18,012 --> 01:21:21,527
in a moment you are lost

844
01:21:22,412 --> 01:21:26,928
Easy, now. Quiet.

845
01:21:29,572 --> 01:21:34,248
There, now it expired.
Can you take its innocent attire?

846
01:21:34,452 --> 01:21:38,286
You won't ever get to be
a proper man.

847
01:21:40,892 --> 01:21:43,008
Let me do it.

848
01:21:43,212 --> 01:21:48,411
- You're a coward.
- Yes, but I'm so scared of mum.

849
01:22:03,372 --> 01:22:06,205
I wish I could go to
a classy ball someday.

850
01:22:06,412 --> 01:22:09,802
Don't you wish for that.
They're so sinful.

851
01:22:10,012 --> 01:22:12,287
You and your sin, you bore.

852
01:22:12,492 --> 01:22:15,370
- Soon it'll be a sin to eat.
- Listen to them.

853
01:22:15,572 --> 01:22:18,132
They take pride in their disgrace.

854
01:22:18,332 --> 01:22:21,881
They're not touching at all.
They're not even kissing.

855
01:22:22,092 --> 01:22:24,367
You wouldn't know.

856
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:28,645
- You're just a child.
- You always say that.

857
01:22:28,852 --> 01:22:33,403
There are so many things,
and everything is loathsome.

858
01:22:33,612 --> 01:22:35,807
Ditte, bring those glasses.

859
01:23:00,132 --> 01:23:02,123
What's with the swaying?

860
01:23:02,332 --> 01:23:06,291
Sorry, mistress,
I think I got dizzy. I'm sorry.

861
01:23:07,852 --> 01:23:10,969
She couldn't cope with
the smell of liqueur.

862
01:23:13,012 --> 01:23:16,322
Or perhaps it was your cigar.

863
01:24:00,492 --> 01:24:02,926
Do I not bring lovely sunshine?

864
01:24:03,972 --> 01:24:09,171
and Ditte walks upon the road

865
01:24:09,372 --> 01:24:14,924
so red and round and sad

866
01:24:15,132 --> 01:24:21,480
she bumps into a little prince

867
01:24:21,692 --> 01:24:26,447
in scarlet clad

868
01:24:26,652 --> 01:24:27,767
What's your name?

869
01:24:27,972 --> 01:24:34,810
I'm Ditte Love and Ditte Rascal
and Ditte Child of Man.

870
01:24:56,572 --> 01:24:59,644
She isn't very pretty.

871
01:24:59,852 --> 01:25:04,642
No, because she carries the most
pretty on the inside. Her heart.

872
01:25:04,852 --> 01:25:08,128
But it's not in high regard, -

873
01:25:08,332 --> 01:25:11,642
- so it's tucked away safely.

874
01:25:11,852 --> 01:25:14,412
Can I see it?

875
01:25:19,452 --> 01:25:24,765
We'd rather not,
because it may easily get dusty.

876
01:25:27,892 --> 01:25:31,282
But you're welcome to have her.

877
01:25:48,572 --> 01:25:51,484
Is that you, Karl?

878
01:25:51,692 --> 01:25:55,401
Now the hawkers have left.

879
01:25:55,612 --> 01:25:57,443
That scum.

880
01:25:57,652 --> 01:26:02,806
Don't you think about them anymore.
That won't make anything better.

881
01:26:03,012 --> 01:26:07,244
She didn't walk them to the cart.
Maybe she couldn't even walk.

882
01:26:07,452 --> 01:26:10,285
Why not?

883
01:26:10,492 --> 01:26:13,609
She drinks along with them.

884
01:26:13,812 --> 01:26:16,246
- Maybe she even ...
- Easy.

885
01:26:16,452 --> 01:26:20,240
I will give you
the little help I can.

886
01:26:22,652 --> 01:26:26,361
Karl, do you believe
that old maids go to Heaven?

887
01:26:26,572 --> 01:26:29,086
That depends on
how they've lived.

888
01:26:29,292 --> 01:26:31,886
It doesn't.
My granny is in Heaven.

889
01:26:32,092 --> 01:26:35,767
I suppose one has to make room
for the Lord as well.

890
01:26:35,972 --> 01:26:38,964
Yes, for granny's sake, that is.

891
01:26:40,012 --> 01:26:41,968
If only I were like you.

892
01:26:42,172 --> 01:26:44,447
Why are we whispering?

893
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:47,403
Why indeed?

894
01:26:55,572 --> 01:26:58,325
What have you got there?

895
01:26:58,532 --> 01:27:00,409
My shoulder blade.

896
01:27:00,612 --> 01:27:04,366
I got that from carrying
the little ones so much.

897
01:27:05,412 --> 01:27:08,609
Is it a sin
to pray for beauty, Karl?

898
01:27:08,812 --> 01:27:11,042
I wish to be a good girl, -

899
01:27:11,252 --> 01:27:14,642
- but it wouldn't harm
to be a bit pretty as well.
