1
00:00:02,192 --> 00:00:05,714
<i>For my father</i>

2
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:54,183
THE HEART'S CRY

3
00:02:14,928 --> 00:02:19,005
Who could be more free than an eagle?

4
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:21,520
Man is, Grandfather...

5
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:26,264
Man is as free as an eagle,
man can do everything.

6
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,869
Water, please.

7
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:52,032
You smoke too much, Grandfather.

8
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,257
I know.

9
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:57,695
Thank you.

10
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:14,162
- Coming, Moctar?
- No, Mother's waiting for me!

11
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,941
The postman's here!

12
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:45,952
Onadja Madja...

13
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,733
Ouedraogo Tassere...

14
00:03:56,638 --> 00:03:58,476
Saffi Sow...

15
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:21,627
Moctar, come here!

16
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:30,136
Guess what your father has written...

17
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,345
We're going to France.

18
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:48,156
Who will look after you, Grandfather?

19
00:05:51,598 --> 00:05:57,992
Don't worry, the aunts and uncles
in the village will look after me.

20
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:05,232
Go now, your mother's waiting.

21
00:06:13,608 --> 00:06:15,606
You'll miss the bus...

22
00:06:26,896 --> 00:06:30,432
- You'll bring something back?
- I won't forget you, Adissa.

23
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:38,139
- For your husband.
- Thanks, he'll be pleased.

24
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,607
Where's Moctar?

25
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,817
Just like in Dad's postcards...

26
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:36,400
He took me with my mouth open...

27
00:08:37,032 --> 00:08:39,639
Do you think that's funny?

28
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,239
- Anything else?
- A pencil case.

29
00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:53,869
And a bag, too. That one...

30
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:58,981
Ibrahim, aren't these nice?

31
00:09:23,374 --> 00:09:27,416
- It's all ours?
- You haven't seen everything.

32
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,520
My workers...

33
00:09:34,045 --> 00:09:35,716
My office...

34
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:42,895
I'm proud of you, you're a success.

35
00:09:51,947 --> 00:09:57,211
Everyone laughed at us. They said
you'd never send for us.

36
00:09:57,494 --> 00:10:00,410
They even thought you'd married
a white girl.

37
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:07,696
What did they know? I worked hard
night and day for all this.

38
00:10:08,247 --> 00:10:13,888
Yet I had to borrow to set this up.
But now you're here, everything's fine.

39
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:20,419
Really? How many times were you
unfaithful to me?

40
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,458
And how many times
were you unfaithful?

41
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:37,888
Let's go home.

42
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,502
Are there hyenas in France?

43
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:58,039
I saw one at the garage.

44
00:10:58,052 --> 00:11:00,285
In the garage?

45
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,209
The only hyenas in France are in zoos.

46
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:34,941
- Now it's you and me.
- You must catch me first!

47
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:45,785
- Ibrahim, what are you doing?
- No one can see.

48
00:11:59,672 --> 00:12:01,545
25 times 12...

49
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:10,294
5 times 2, 2 times 2, plus...

50
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,296
The new one's clever...

51
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,837
- Mum says Africans use magic charms.
- She talks through her hat.

52
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:25,730
Very good, Moctar. Sit down.

53
00:12:26,532 --> 00:12:30,099
Now, page 25 of the textbook.

54
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:55,830
Ibrahim, you old rogue.

55
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,790
I'm not joking, Mustapha.

56
00:12:59,663 --> 00:13:05,112
If you can get that job for my wife,
it'll help out. Times are hard...

57
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,660
You're telling me. I'll call you
when I have news.

58
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,064
I knew I could count on you.

59
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,339
Good evening, Moctar.

60
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:34,772
Did your father call?

61
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,262
No.

62
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:46,893
- Have you eaten?
- There was pasta in the fridge.

63
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:49,392
- Any dessert?
- No.

64
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:05,284
I'm getting a rise, isn't that good?

65
00:15:08,056 --> 00:15:13,108
You're tired, you work too much.

66
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,663
I'm doing it for you, you know...

67
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:19,599
I know.

68
00:15:20,212 --> 00:15:23,654
Your father wants you to go far...

69
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,761
You'll be a doctor, the first
doctor from our village.

70
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:40,703
<i>Kingsley Ofusu is not European,
he is Ghanaian.</i>

71
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:46,026
<i>You've seen him on television, the
sole survivor from the Mac Ruby.</i>

72
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,582
<i>The cargo boat's Ukrainian crew
discovered eight stowaways...</i>

73
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:15,304
- You can copy from me, if you like.
- No, thank you.

74
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:58,148
- Moctar, what's the matter?
- A hyena!

75
00:20:06,464 --> 00:20:09,887
Where did you see a hyena?
There aren't any.

76
00:20:13,632 --> 00:20:15,811
I tell you there are no hyenas
in France.

77
00:20:16,398 --> 00:20:23,254
Hyenas live in the wild, they need
heat and prey. They live in Africa.

78
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:30,703
You're eleven, you're a man. Even
a lion shouldn't frighten you.

79
00:20:32,072 --> 00:20:35,930
At your age I was cutting wood,
ask your mother.

80
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:40,805
You're different, make the most of it.

81
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:48,753
Father's right, Moctar, this is France,
not Africa. No hyenas here.

82
00:20:56,492 --> 00:20:59,730
Hyena in France...
Where has he got this from?

83
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:02,142
He'll forget it by tomorrow.

84
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,475
Watch out for kids!

85
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:28,706
- He's not hurt!
- You needn't drive like a maniac.

86
00:21:38,493 --> 00:21:46,253
Was Napoleon honest when he promised
freedom to the inhabitants of Haiti?

87
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:53,837
A hyena, right in front of me.
I swear it's true.

88
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,289
But there aren't hyenas in France.

89
00:21:57,502 --> 00:22:02,189
That's what my father said, but what
about my knee? Isn't that proof?

90
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:05,966
You two, tell me what this
vital conversation is about?

91
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:11,982
It wasn't me.

92
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,742
It was me.

93
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:23,279
Mamadou, how are things with you?

94
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:28,440
My family's been here a month now.

95
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:35,216
Not like that. With this...

96
00:22:54,558 --> 00:23:00,535
Don't worry, everything's fine.
Give my love to everyone.

97
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:05,038
Benoit, you must lift it.

98
00:23:06,967 --> 00:23:08,523
Give me the spanner.

99
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:27,012
Monsieur Guerin, it's about Moctar,
it's very serious...

100
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,656
He said that saw a hyena.

101
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:37,930
All right, go back to class.
I'll let you know.

102
00:23:48,376 --> 00:23:53,668
I keep repairing your car, and you
keep telling the same story...

103
00:23:53,984 --> 00:24:00,546
"My wife's ill, my kid's ill, I'm ill".
Do you think I'm the social service?

104
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:04,262
I swear on my mother's head I'll pay.

105
00:24:04,432 --> 00:24:10,185
When you pay, you can take the car.
Benoit, Jean, the car stays here.

106
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:18,897
Monsieur Sow? I'm Paul Guerin, a
psychologist. It's about your son.

107
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:26,847
A strange question, but has he ever
talked about hyenas?

108
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,064
You're bothered about that?
A kid's nightmare?

109
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:34,384
A nightmare that has upset him.

110
00:24:34,876 --> 00:24:37,865
Moctar is convinced that he has
really seen a hyena.

111
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:43,988
He made it up to get attention.

112
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:48,670
That's just the problem: he made it up.

113
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:52,465
But why a hyena?

114
00:24:53,675 --> 00:24:55,877
There are much nicer animals...

115
00:24:56,593 --> 00:25:00,655
At home in Africa they're common,
lots of them.

116
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:07,410
I'm afraid that your son has not
managed to adapt yet.

117
00:25:09,699 --> 00:25:14,666
He will, depend on me, he'll adapt.

118
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:19,722
Why does he tell everyone such things?
We've enough problems as it is.

119
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:28,075
We're foreigners here, lie low. The
slightest thing can cause trouble.

120
00:25:28,843 --> 00:25:30,880
No more hyena stories.

121
00:25:31,687 --> 00:25:32,933
But I did see it.

122
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,887
Put yourself in his place.
It's not easy for him.

123
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:44,048
Do you think it was easy for me?
Five years of sacrifice!

124
00:25:58,655 --> 00:26:00,926
You'll drive your father mad.

125
00:26:02,348 --> 00:26:04,599
Forget the hyena.

126
00:26:10,326 --> 00:26:17,224
There are no hyenas in France.

127
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:26,888
This is France, not Africa.

128
00:27:31,454 --> 00:27:35,118
I don't understand how he thought up
such rubbish.

129
00:27:36,352 --> 00:27:38,319
Forget about it.

130
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:41,280
He may never have seen a hyena
in Africa.

131
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:46,017
Surely, but what I do know is that
your father spoiled him.

132
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:51,581
No one could rise their voice to
Moctar, the old man would flare up.

133
00:27:52,377 --> 00:27:54,653
You know how your father is.

134
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:58,728
He was very hard on me,
never satisfied.

135
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:03,145
"Ibrahim do this. Ibrahim do that".
He drove me crazy.

136
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:09,593
I think we work too much.

137
00:28:10,341 --> 00:28:16,733
It's as though we're still apart,
in two different worlds.

138
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,764
Not now. Aren't things better?

139
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,533
We hardly have a moment to ourselves.

140
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:31,165
I hate to see you like this.

141
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,596
Go back to your pals now.

142
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,521
Moctar, you've gone dotty!

143
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:59,232
Leave him alone!

144
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:01,994
Shut up, traitor!

145
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:44,455
- Down in the dumps?
- Everyone thinks I'm lying.

146
00:30:45,328 --> 00:30:47,640
- What does your father do?
- He has a garage.

147
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:52,137
- Do you like it here?
- I don't know. What do you do?

148
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:58,181
That's much too long a story.
I'll show you a trick. Watch closely.

149
00:31:01,437 --> 00:31:03,443
Are you a magician?

150
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:06,695
I'll do it again. Watch closely.

151
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,110
Deborah, come on!

152
00:31:42,391 --> 00:31:43,224
Your wife?

153
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:49,389
Sort of. It depends...

154
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:33,712
Don't go overboard on some strange kid.

155
00:32:34,447 --> 00:32:37,762
That's life, too, poppet.

156
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:46,942
I've seen Moctar again. It seems
he has hallucinations.

157
00:32:48,322 --> 00:32:54,740
I'm afraid I'm not competent to deal
with that. See a psychiatrist.

158
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:59,468
What do you mean? My son isn't mad.

159
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:05,648
Say something, Ibrahim.

160
00:33:22,376 --> 00:33:26,340
Look at me. Have I really changed?

161
00:33:29,625 --> 00:33:35,140
Moctar is my blood, I love him as you
do, but he is ill, he must be cured.

162
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,685
No one says he's mad.

163
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:47,721
What's happened to us?
I just want to understand.

164
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:49,816
But I'm here...

165
00:33:51,627 --> 00:33:52,960
Don't you trust me?

166
00:33:59,464 --> 00:34:01,936
We'll do what you say.

167
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:06,447
We'll see the psychiatrist.

168
00:35:31,773 --> 00:35:33,944
Don't tell me you saw it again.

169
00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:38,376
Let's go home.

170
00:35:42,596 --> 00:35:47,030
Sometimes you think you recognize
someone, but it's a stranger...

171
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:48,901
...you've never seen before.

172
00:35:49,863 --> 00:35:52,383
Our imagination plays tricks on us.

173
00:35:52,865 --> 00:35:55,216
Maybe it was a big cat...

174
00:35:57,227 --> 00:36:00,654
Maybe... maybe...

175
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:07,141
They're fantastic!

176
00:36:07,463 --> 00:36:13,902
I'd like to please you, but to say I
saw a hyena... I'd be thought mad.

177
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:17,766
Sorry, that's not what I meant to say.

178
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:22,664
- You don't believe me, either.
- Of course I do.

179
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:26,448
Deborah, when she's had a few...

180
00:36:27,257 --> 00:36:31,595
...she sees pink elephants,
herds of pink elephants.

181
00:36:33,087 --> 00:36:35,278
Of course I believe you.

182
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:36,876
You were born in France?

183
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:41,241
Yes, but Mother and I went back to
Africa when I was five...

184
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:45,433
...because Father couldn't afford
to feed us all.

185
00:36:49,914 --> 00:36:52,241
That's where I live...

186
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:11,576
As a kid, I dreamed of working in a
circus; all those lights and costumes...

187
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:14,557
Always on the move, too.

188
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:21,112
My father said it was too dangerous.
Even a cat put the wind up him.

189
00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:23,392
He wasn't very brave.

190
00:37:23,603 --> 00:37:30,045
It was ignorance, rather. The less
you know, the more things scare you.

191
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:40,440
My grandfather says that dogs are the
only animal worthy of a man.

192
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:45,458
- He's a very wise man.
- Everyone in the village says so.

193
00:37:46,253 --> 00:37:50,201
But he's ill. He coughs a lot.

194
00:37:56,875 --> 00:38:01,240
You're a nice lad, but I doubt if
I'll visit your country.

195
00:38:06,503 --> 00:38:07,878
You're into little darkies now?

196
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:11,473
What are you on about, arsehole?

197
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:13,839
He's insulted us!

198
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,916
Well, they weren't mucking about.

199
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:28,872
Since when have you been a softie?
I'll make coffee.

200
00:38:39,408 --> 00:38:42,990
I warned you. That kid is nothing
but trouble.

201
00:38:44,335 --> 00:38:46,294
He needs me.

202
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:50,228
I need you, too.

203
00:38:52,612 --> 00:38:55,063
He's got parents, hasn't he?

204
00:38:55,946 --> 00:38:59,403
Don't think you can wipe out your past
so easily.

205
00:39:03,144 --> 00:39:06,296
- Where are you going?
- No idea...

206
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,831
Hello, Grandfather.

207
00:39:29,626 --> 00:39:31,731
Open it.

208
00:39:34,727 --> 00:39:36,415
I'm sure you'll like it.

209
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:53,015
- Tell him now. You promised.
- You're the man. It's not my job.

210
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,795
Thank you...

211
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:02,760
Why such a face? Everything's fine.

212
00:40:04,094 --> 00:40:06,889
Let's have a man to man talk.

213
00:40:27,145 --> 00:40:30,419
Moctar, that rocking is
getting on my nerves.

214
00:40:35,818 --> 00:40:39,365
I told you, the trip will do you good.

215
00:40:40,215 --> 00:40:42,056
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Moctar.

216
00:40:42,224 --> 00:40:43,750
Sleep well, son.

217
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,553
You can do that later...

218
00:42:20,937 --> 00:42:24,181
There's uncle Mamadou.
How he's aged...

219
00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:49,456
You sing badly...

220
00:42:51,156 --> 00:42:56,790
I'm fed up here, it's deserted.
You'll be rested here, for sure.

221
00:43:02,131 --> 00:43:03,520
Not bad, eh?

222
00:43:06,512 --> 00:43:09,111
I'm going for a pee...

223
00:43:15,703 --> 00:43:20,855
When you last saw Saffi she was
no taller than her son.

224
00:43:21,335 --> 00:43:24,872
How is my old friend Karim these days?

225
00:43:25,259 --> 00:43:29,426
One-eyed Karim? A crocodile ate him.

226
00:43:30,686 --> 00:43:32,284
Karim is dead?

227
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:37,586
Crocodiles are sly. It must have
come up to Karim from behind.

228
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:19,983
I told you never to speak to strangers.
Do you know him?

229
00:45:46,006 --> 00:45:49,656
Look after Moctar and don't be
late back.

230
00:45:50,048 --> 00:45:53,800
- They seem to get on together.
- Adama wants a kid brother.

231
00:45:53,901 --> 00:45:57,317
- So why not give him one?
- Talk to Mamadou about that!

232
00:46:07,202 --> 00:46:08,724
Let me try...

233
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:40,792
What's it like there, in Mali?

234
00:46:40,919 --> 00:46:45,597
You've never been there?
I don't believe it.

235
00:46:49,216 --> 00:46:50,697
Tell me...

236
00:46:50,906 --> 00:46:55,402
It's never cold there, and everyone
knows everyone else.

237
00:46:55,959 --> 00:46:57,256
Here, too...

238
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,857
You can see further...

239
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,127
Have you seen the hyenas?

240
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:07,136
- What?
- A hyena.

241
00:47:07,884 --> 00:47:13,208
There are no hyenas in France. But you
must have seen lots in Africa.

242
00:47:13,506 --> 00:47:15,394
Here, too...

243
00:47:23,246 --> 00:47:27,673
- He's having you on?
- No, he said he saw a hyena.

244
00:47:27,912 --> 00:47:30,939
- A hyena in France?
- That's what he told me.

245
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:41,809
What's this about your son
seeing hyenas everywhere?

246
00:47:49,264 --> 00:47:50,927
Ibrahim doesn't want it talked about.

247
00:47:51,007 --> 00:47:56,139
I can understand him being ashamed
to tell others, but why not tell me?

248
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:01,333
- He didn't want to bother you.
- I'll see about that...

249
00:48:01,334 --> 00:48:04,797
- There's no problem...
- Oh, sure!

250
00:48:17,143 --> 00:48:20,973
I haven't seen you, you're not there...

251
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,137
You don't exist...

252
00:48:30,423 --> 00:48:36,199
Why are you crying?
What's the matter?

253
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:47,350
Stop crying. Tell me...

254
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:51,351
You'll wake the house...

255
00:48:56,612 --> 00:48:59,023
Don't bottle it up...

256
00:49:01,213 --> 00:49:07,189
Did you see the hyena again?

257
00:49:08,054 --> 00:49:10,593
I want to go home.

258
00:49:13,711 --> 00:49:20,072
Let's say the hyena is real and
you really did see it...

259
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:24,030
That's no reason to be so afraid...

260
00:49:24,821 --> 00:49:28,320
Hyenas are timid animals.

261
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:33,296
Grandfather didn't say that...

262
00:49:34,052 --> 00:49:37,380
He told me they could be dangerous...

263
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:42,593
...and death always follows them.

264
00:49:44,312 --> 00:49:47,864
Him and his stories...

265
00:50:40,568 --> 00:50:42,994
Don't forget to write...

266
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:29,530
I'm sure he saw it again...

267
00:51:29,857 --> 00:51:34,327
He said so? How do you know?

268
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:39,869
He's my son, I sense such things.

269
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:48,319
Open your eyes...

270
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,831
Can't you see this isn't the place for us?

271
00:51:51,072 --> 00:51:54,544
You mean I shouldn't have sent for you...

272
00:51:55,136 --> 00:51:57,569
I was wrong to want us to be together?

273
00:51:59,633 --> 00:52:00,844
Did you see a hyena?

274
00:52:01,058 --> 00:52:04,660
So don't you go on about it, too...

275
00:52:05,309 --> 00:52:07,780
Allright, be unsympathetic...

276
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:12,234
Let's stop this arguing.

277
00:52:18,165 --> 00:52:21,123
You know what we'll do about Moctar?

278
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:55,139
Moctar, stay there.

279
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:01,446
Don't talk to him like that...

280
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,103
Remember what the doctor said.

281
00:54:04,147 --> 00:54:05,804
Has it happened before?

282
00:54:06,492 --> 00:54:09,430
You've no idea what the reason could be?

283
00:54:10,343 --> 00:54:14,108
We went to the doctor,
then the chemist's...

284
00:54:14,243 --> 00:54:18,877
What about it? There's no connection.

285
00:54:20,135 --> 00:54:23,640
- No connection? Tell him the truth.
- That's not the point.

286
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:28,837
We really don't know the reason.

287
00:54:29,208 --> 00:54:30,701
Do you want us to find him, or not?

288
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,326
Don't worry, they'll find him.

289
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,621
I won't bother you...

290
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:48,954
Take no notice of me.

291
00:54:49,073 --> 00:54:51,170
But you can't stay here.

292
00:54:51,513 --> 00:54:54,201
Think of your parents, you can't leave them.

293
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,158
What can I do with you?

294
00:55:02,357 --> 00:55:06,279
You can't vanish just like that...

295
00:55:06,314 --> 00:55:07,703
You'll break my heart.

296
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:10,271
Chuck him out, or I'll call the cops!

297
00:55:11,127 --> 00:55:17,191
Had your say?
Back to your faxhole, then...

298
00:55:19,975 --> 00:55:21,735
It's my fault...

299
00:56:04,975 --> 00:56:06,735
Don't worry...

300
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:11,392
What can he do,
he doesn't know anyone here.

301
00:56:12,513 --> 00:56:14,208
He'll come back.

302
00:56:17,713 --> 00:56:19,744
You're so stolid...

303
00:56:19,999 --> 00:56:22,624
Nothing seems to affect you.

304
00:56:24,434 --> 00:56:28,299
But did you ever wonder
if we liked this place...

305
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,324
...the rain, the cold?

306
00:56:31,557 --> 00:56:36,264
You've had time to get used to it,
but Moctar is still a child.

307
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:40,750
He's not the only one to have
left home for France.

308
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,404
All I ask is that he does well at school.

309
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:51,131
Do you want me to give everything up
and go back to Africa?

310
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:55,108
You know that's not the question.

311
00:56:55,822 --> 00:56:58,276
Be more understanding...

312
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:03,409
If he comes back, don't tell him off.

313
00:57:04,896 --> 00:57:07,736
- Promise?
- I promise.

314
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,602
We'll see tomorrow.
Now you have two homes.

315
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,224
Deborah will get over it.

316
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:38,447
And don't worry about your beast.

317
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:43,623
Millions believe in the Virgin Mary.
Those who've seen her have statues.

318
00:57:44,111 --> 00:57:46,727
So you see hyenas, that's all.

319
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,275
- See you tomorrow...
- Bye!

320
00:58:07,414 --> 00:58:09,303
Is it a curfew or something?

321
00:58:09,451 --> 00:58:11,406
Can't we suffer in peace?

322
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:31,121
That will help you sleep.

323
00:59:08,376 --> 00:59:10,543
Shall we go home?

324
00:59:15,431 --> 00:59:18,119
Do you know what Moctar asked me?

325
00:59:20,215 --> 00:59:25,503
- What?
- Whether you were my wife.

326
00:59:28,536 --> 00:59:30,031
What did you tell him?

327
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,856
Yes...

328
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:37,784
Till death us do part.

329
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,646
Liar...

330
00:59:54,274 --> 00:59:56,114
Will you give me a baby?

331
00:59:57,579 --> 01:00:02,316
I promise he'll be
as good as your friend Moctar.

332
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:05,203
As good as Moctar?

333
01:00:05,627 --> 01:00:07,980
Let's set about it, then.

334
01:01:03,527 --> 01:01:06,096
That's good...

335
01:01:09,847 --> 01:01:11,770
No hard feelings?

336
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:15,576
No hard feelings.

337
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:03,087
Come out...

338
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:08,125
All right?

339
01:02:09,296 --> 01:02:13,943
The medicines
make me sleep all the time.

340
01:02:14,223 --> 01:02:16,126
Never mind...

341
01:02:16,283 --> 01:02:18,661
Look who I've brought to see you.

342
01:02:49,468 --> 01:02:52,093
Can you do it again?

343
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:56,560
The show is over.
Now it's time for bed.

344
01:03:02,503 --> 01:03:05,047
A closing number?

345
01:03:20,137 --> 01:03:23,849
- Won't you help me?
- No need to shout.

346
01:03:30,114 --> 01:03:33,026
You must help me to get rid of
that rotten beast.

347
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:05,742
- Why come here?
- I'm sure this is its lair.

348
01:04:08,543 --> 01:04:12,176
You're the expert...

349
01:04:13,671 --> 01:04:16,471
Over there...

350
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,133
Moctar, I've been thinking...

351
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:45,998
Listen...

352
01:04:52,544 --> 01:04:54,765
It's the rain!

353
01:05:02,572 --> 01:05:07,173
I drove my lorry all over Europe.
I even went to Pakistan.

354
01:05:13,229 --> 01:05:16,405
Then eleven years ago,
when you were hardly born...

355
01:05:17,769 --> 01:05:22,545
...a kid ran in front of me
on the road to Marseilles.

356
01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:25,412
He ran after his ball...

357
01:05:25,999 --> 01:05:28,505
A red ball with black stripes.

358
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:33,223
I braked like mad...

359
01:05:37,764 --> 01:05:40,015
I avoided the ball...

360
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:43,718
...but not the boy.

361
01:05:52,909 --> 01:05:55,004
Are you asleep?

362
01:07:36,815 --> 01:07:40,286
Moctar, wake up.

363
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:54,666
- It didn't come.
- You ought to be happy.

364
01:07:54,941 --> 01:07:56,643
Because of the rain...

365
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:00,826
No, it's afraid of us.

366
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:04,373
It knows you're going to stop it.

367
01:08:05,555 --> 01:08:07,827
But I must catch it.

368
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:11,706
We won't let it get away next time...

369
01:08:12,696 --> 01:08:15,556
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

370
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:31,364
I am sorry...

371
01:09:33,176 --> 01:09:34,659
You've done well...

372
01:09:34,878 --> 01:09:36,824
What wouldn't I do for you?

373
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:40,359
Mattress, matches, petrol...

374
01:09:40,817 --> 01:09:43,553
...it's up to you now.

375
01:10:27,038 --> 01:10:29,222
Rotten beast...

376
01:10:29,223 --> 01:10:31,730
You've had it today...

377
01:12:08,523 --> 01:12:11,060
See, I saved its life.

378
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,336
Now do you believe it's real?

379
01:12:14,792 --> 01:12:18,307
I didn't see, I was asleep.

380
01:12:20,895 --> 01:12:24,295
Never mind,
now it will protect you for ever.

381
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:34,213
Grandfather!

382
01:12:34,214 --> 01:12:36,313
He's not here.

383
01:12:36,314 --> 01:12:39,496
Where can you see your grandfather?

384
01:12:39,821 --> 01:12:45,293
Never repeat that to anyone,
or they're bound to put you in hospital.

385
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:49,334
There's no grandfather here.

386
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,939
Monsieur Paulo...

387
01:13:00,304 --> 01:13:05,200
- Have you adjusted that carburettor?
- Yes, it's ready, isn't it, lads?

388
01:13:10,641 --> 01:13:13,659
Let's go for a stroll...

389
01:13:17,503 --> 01:13:22,252
Your father's funny. He yells about
nothing, says nothing about something.

390
01:13:22,386 --> 01:13:24,701
He's always like that.

391
01:13:25,053 --> 01:13:27,293
Guess what he did once...

392
01:14:06,441 --> 01:14:07,979
What's the matter?

393
01:14:08,225 --> 01:14:10,092
I'm sure you can do it.

394
01:14:12,703 --> 01:14:15,264
You're sure?

395
01:14:39,711 --> 01:14:42,306
You were right, I can!

396
01:15:18,608 --> 01:15:22,274
I think I'll go back to driving.
How's that for style?

397
01:16:17,182 --> 01:16:19,179
Your grandfather has died.

398
01:16:19,923 --> 01:16:21,728
It's not true!

399
01:16:32,376 --> 01:16:38,007
He was ill for months and
no one let me know.

400
01:16:40,286 --> 01:16:43,430
It's five years since I saw him.

401
01:16:44,056 --> 01:16:47,946
Just imagine... five years.

402
01:16:50,054 --> 01:16:52,462
I'll never see him again.

403
01:16:54,648 --> 01:16:59,316
Calm down...

404
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,560
I heard about your grandfather.

405
01:17:56,917 --> 01:18:03,679
It reminds me of a story I read once,
when I used to read.

406
01:18:05,553 --> 01:18:09,911
It was a poem about an African writer.

407
01:18:10,795 --> 01:18:13,024
It was about life, death...

408
01:18:13,125 --> 01:18:17,126
No, more about death and life.

409
01:18:18,183 --> 01:18:20,824
Something like...

410
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,323
You know, Moctar...

411
01:18:22,512 --> 01:18:27,190
People who die haven't left us.

412
01:18:29,248 --> 01:18:34,086
They're the embers that re-ignite the fire...

413
01:18:35,413 --> 01:18:38,877
The dead are never dead, Moctar.

414
01:18:40,244 --> 01:18:45,661
<i>They're in the weeping grass,
They're in the running water.</i>

415
01:18:47,141 --> 01:18:54,223
<i>They're in still waters,
In the forests, in the home.</i>

416
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:57,690
<i>The dead never leave us.</i>

417
01:18:58,503 --> 01:19:01,127
You see, Moctar?

418
01:19:02,714 --> 01:19:06,297
The dead are never dead.

419
01:19:12,012 --> 01:19:14,029
Let's be going...

420
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:16,943
Paulo, watch closely...

421
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:31,844
You're the greatest!
