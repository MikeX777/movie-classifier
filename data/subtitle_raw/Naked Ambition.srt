00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,604
Hi, Mr. Andy Wong

2
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,870
Hi, Bill Nixon

3
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,411
Reporter of Asia Media Weekly

4
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,315
I've already ran a background
check on you

5
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,352
We'd like to do an interview
and shoot some photos

6
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:09,952
Sure, no problem

7
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,119
People call you Hong Kong's
King of Porn

8
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:16,819
They say you created a whole
new style of pornography

9
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,664
What's your take on that?

10
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,328
They're being nice, but it's true...

11
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,663
...our magazine has the
highest circulation indeed

12
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,373
This way Sure

13
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,711
Are you embarrassed by
having photo's taken

14
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:41,919
with this many naked women?

15
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:43,914
Not at all

16
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,121
In the last few years, I've had
more than 10,000

17
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,657
women strip in front of my face

18
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,590
according to information

19
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,929
You and your partner John are
both graduated from a university

20
00:03:57,136 --> 00:03:58,763
Why would university graduates
turn to porn publishing?

21
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,969
Can you tell us more
about your background?

22
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,392
How did you meet John?

23
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,086
I was a scriptwriter
in a television station

24
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,764
But my career was going nowhere

25
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,990
Then a publishing company hired me

26
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,168
That was how it all started

27
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,895
I met John at the editorial department

28
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:33,933
We hit it off instantly

29
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,504
and became instant friends

30
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,433
What's up?

31
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,407
Angus, how many are they
firing this week?

32
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,204
I heard over a dozen got the pink
slip downstairs

33
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,578
That's sad

34
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,379
I don't think it'll affect us

35
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,647
We are pillars in this organization

36
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,249
Right, we're pillars

37
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,266
This is so painful to watch

38
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,446
For you

39
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,385
John, I wish they had fired me instead

40
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,056
You know I don't really
need the income

41
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,887
I'm not in it for the money

42
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,221
This one's yours

43
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,254
Please clean up and leave by 5pm

44
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,794
Or we'll call security

45
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,031
Come on, was that attitude necessary

46
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:48,976
What's the big plan?

47
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,208
Get another job, I guess

48
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,453
Maybe we should start something

49
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,823
Like what?

50
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:09,028
We're in publishing,
let's start a magazine

51
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,736
What kind of magazine?

52
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,901
They fired a lot of us today

53
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,947
That's fine, my boss said
I'm up for a raise

54
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,481
I'll provide for you

55
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,282
That makes me feel so useless

56
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,719
Of course not, I think you're talented

57
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,586
You just need the right opportunity

58
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,385
This could be the chance

59
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,325
I discussed with a bunch
of old colleagues

60
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,467
We have an idea for a
Shoppers' guide for youngsters

61
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:43,927
I haven't promised anything

62
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,336
How much money will you need?

63
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,804
Less than a hundred grand each

64
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:54,035
It's not a problem for me,
because I don't have any

65
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,338
I do

66
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,273
You do?

67
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,151
All right!

68
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,489
what do you think?

69
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,088
Top notch!

70
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:06,989
This couch is fantastic

71
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,056
It's virtually perfection

72
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,261
For some reasons, the partners
all landed jobs quickly

73
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,830
John joined a newspaper's
adult entertainment page

74
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,200
Can you just wait a minute

75
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,564
I've submitted your pieces to my boss

76
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,433
He should be out quickly

77
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,966
You like your drink?

78
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,109
Boss OK

79
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,305
John, these two articles are crap

80
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,344
Totally unreadable

81
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,276
It's a simplified menu for hookers

82
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,748
Just names of women and their rates

83
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:38,753
We need more descriptions

84
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,381
You his boss?

85
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,918
Who are you?

86
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:44,585
This is Mr. Lam,
the massage parlor expert

87
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,424
And that is George

88
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,564
He is a pimp

89
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,029
If we can write well, we won't need
to drive hookers around

90
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,236
Idiot!

91
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:54,399
What the fuck you want?
Do you need our tips or what?

92
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,267
I told you we're only providing tips

93
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,136
Fine .. .

94
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,566
I don't care

95
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,178
Spend a few hundred dollars

96
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:03,108
Get someone to rewrite these

97
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,577
I need them to be entertaining

98
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,541
As if

99
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,720
These two are legends
in the industry

100
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,617
Yes OK?

101
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,019
4-Eyes became a TV reporter

102
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,453
Mike worked in real estate

103
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:19,524
Ben joined an accounting firm

104
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:20,896
I didn't find any work

105
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,434
Let's think of a name for the pimp

106
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,834
He's real name is Dragon

107
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,741
Lung's to generic, need to spice it up

108
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:34,708
What are his physical attributes?

109
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:35,812
He's quite stocky

110
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,141
Fat Dragon then, simple enough

111
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,643
Easy to recall, Fat Dragon it is

112
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,189
As for the Massage Parlor guy

113
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,852
His name is Jones, he's
quite skinny in person

114
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,789
Skinny Jones?

115
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,019
How about Boney Jones

116
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,161
Boney Jones it is!

117
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,688
Fat Dragon and Boney Jones,
sounds good

118
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,628
Who's going to be which?

119
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,199
Who'll be Fat Dragon and
who'll play Boney Jones?

120
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,267
Let's do this together

121
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,663
We'll switch daily

122
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,668
I'll take Boney today and
you can be Dragon

123
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:01,999
Then we switch tomorrow

124
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,607
Sure .. .

125
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:16,954
The Guide's called Look Guide?

126
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,191
Sounds like "drop dead"
in Cantonese!

127
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,792
The name was your idea!

128
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,925
I thought you know how
to change luck with names

129
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,758
How could we call
our guide "drop dead"

130
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:27,929
It was all because you called

131
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,963
And said there wasn't anytime left

132
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,033
You could have used "Luck"

133
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,500
Or "Lucky"

134
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,603
Should I have used
the name "Luke" instead

135
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,839
Why not?

136
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,940
But how could you have chosen
the word "Look"

137
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,839
Grammatically doesn't
make any sense!

138
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,471
Good news!

139
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,342
I looked over, but our guide .. .

140
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:46,809
Uh-oh, look guide
(drop dead) indeed

141
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:49,711
Lots of reader letters?

142
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,288
A pile for Fat Dragon, and
another for Boney Jones

143
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:53,822
It's only been one day

144
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,485
This is awesome

145
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,765
I asked the distributor

146
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,970
He says only two kinds of books
make money now

147
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,532
This is one

148
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,028
And this is the other

149
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,171
Let's have your opinions

150
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,207
4-eyes

151
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,175
Personally, I'm a Christian

152
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:19,851
I have a strict stand in these things

153
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,580
I think text books can help students

154
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,121
I agree with 4-eyes

155
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,294
We can study the school curriculum

156
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,223
Make friends with school teachers

157
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,728
I'm sure we can sell these books easily

158
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,761
I just want to know our investment

159
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,662
How many books do we sell
to make our money back

160
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:38,562
Pubic hair!

161
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:39,534
You saw a lot?

162
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,471
How about you, John?

163
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,909
I .. .

164
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,206
I think text book is a good idea

165
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,556
I bought lots of them
when I was in school .. .

166
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,515
Fuck every hole she has

167
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,126
Use your hands when necessary

168
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,358
.. .for exercise

169
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,603
Text book, that's a good idea

170
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,412
It's a brilliant idea

171
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,418
I agree a hundred percent

172
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,964
Let's put this to a vote

173
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,595
Those in favor of text books?

174
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,934
Those in favor of porn magazines?

175
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:57,172
Good morning

176
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,247
Good morning

177
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,015
We're looking for Mr. Dai

178
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,377
Whom shall I say is looking?

179
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,746
You can tell him it's John

180
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:03,578
Wait a minute

181
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:04,518
Thanks

182
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,448
I want another headline

183
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,254
A bunch of useless hacks!

184
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,558
How are you two youngsters?

185
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:17,597
Sit .. .

186
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:19,304
Go on!

187
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:20,400
Coffee?

188
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,832
Two cups of coffee, Darlene!

189
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,106
You're too kind

190
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,535
Scrap that then

191
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,569
How are you guys?

192
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,973
Our industry really needs people
like you two

193
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,840
Full of creative talents

194
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,415
We've met before .. .

195
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,148
John

196
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,015
Of course, John, we've met

197
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,518
Twice, right?

198
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,222
We publish anything

199
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:41,724
Diet Magazines

200
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:43,659
Theology books

201
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,454
Aeronautical Science

202
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,634
Encyclopedia of Herbal Medicine

203
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,436
I wrote this myself,
Japanese for Beginners

204
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,266
I'm Nakamura Naoko

205
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,508
What's your big idea?

206
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,676
Haven't you guys prepared anything

207
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,213
We haven't

208
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,774
We just want to print a porn magazine

209
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,212
We don't print porn here

210
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,314
How dirty can you go?

211
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,189
I am Fat Dragon

212
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,321
and I'm Boney Jones

213
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,550
Or sometimes I am Fat Dragon

214
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,659
And I am Boney Jones

215
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,497
You should've said something earlier

216
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:21,763
Darlene, bring in the red wine!

217
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:22,723
Sit down please

218
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,562
Japan had had Guidebook
to Hookers for quite some

219
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,966
Were you the first to do something
like that in Hong Kong

220
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,774
Yes, purely by coincidence

221
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,978
Fat Dragon and Boney Jones
were such a hit

222
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,841
I knew then that this would become
the trend for porn magazines

223
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,243
Even though nobody else
believed in us

224
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,277
It was more difficult than

225
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,248
we imagined it to be

226
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,285
The other partners weren't helping

227
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,421
John and I did everything by ourselves

228
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,535
Ben, there are two guys looking for you

229
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,235
Hi, Mr. Ben

230
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,405
We're from Wild Side Magazine

231
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,274
He's John, I'm Andy

232
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,919
We'd like to request for an
in depth interview

233
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:16,314
to promote your club

234
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,022
Or you can post an
advertisement with us

235
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,919
No need for any advertising here

236
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,093
We've got lots of reliable
customers already

237
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:23,888
But .. .although this place is a hit .. .

238
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,993
This place could be an even bigger hit

239
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,961
We can write recommendations
for the girls here .. .

240
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,259
I told you it's not necessary

241
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:41,302
Come over here, mister

242
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,412
What environment?

243
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,184
It's fucking quiet these days

244
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,580
No one can get a fucking customer,
damn it

245
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,081
Guys, looking for a good massage?

246
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,620
What's up, bro?

247
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:57,857
Chippy told us to come here

248
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,892
Said we should look for the Ma Brothers

249
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:00,860
Right .. .

250
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,924
Chippy recommended?

251
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:05,393
I'm Big Ma, he's Little Ma

252
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,137
How are you?

253
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,270
Sit please

254
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:09,034
Thanks

255
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:12,936
What's on your mind?

256
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,770
We'd like to launch a magazine

257
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,474
It'll be a one of its kind
guide to the sex trade

258
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:20,082
An extraordinary guide

259
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,844
We'd like to interview you both
and the girls who work for you

260
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,521
Do some marketing for you

261
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,823
This is fucking funny

262
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,358
What kind of an idea is that?

263
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,698
Prostitution marketing?

264
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,525
What are your names?

265
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,367
I'm John, this is Andy

266
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,561
John fucking Andy

267
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,399
No, I'm Andy

268
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,370
Kidding .. .

269
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,875
Have you guys ever
tried hookers before?

270
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:49,877
What?

271
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:50,911
I haven't

272
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,378
Neither have I .. .

273
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:57,216
You haven't even tried it yourselves yet
you want to market our trade?

274
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,118
This is fucking hilarious

275
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,493
Anyway, I've got the time,
so I'll have fun with you guys

276
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,060
Get the girls out here

277
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,360
Hold on

278
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,633
Girls, get the hell out here!

279
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,435
Customers?

280
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,170
Hurry!

281
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,837
Come on, hurry

282
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,607
I'll show you what real prostitutes are

283
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,846
These girls are all prostitutes

284
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,245
Whores for short

285
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:28,317
Choose one

286
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,222
Shit, stop pretending

287
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,516
Do you know what's rule number one?

288
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:36,024
Hookers hate shy guys,
they won't give you head

289
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:36,922
OK, I'll pick for you

290
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:37,823
Gosh, you're too much .. .

291
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,931
Ling, take off your tops

292
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,490
Watch out for a nose bleed

293
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,326
Now that's what I call headlights

294
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:44,365
Good stuff

295
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,036
Fuck, stop pretending

296
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,205
Coco, take it off

297
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,340
Chandeliers Guaranteed nose bleed!

298
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,042
Good stuff, eh?

299
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:54,639
Come over here

300
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,814
I bet you're just pretending

301
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,473
Make some room

302
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,286
Didn't you say you want to
market this stuff

303
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,317
You can feel it up close now

304
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:08,048
Judge for yourselves if they're real

305
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,056
Feel it

306
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,064
Come on

307
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:20,029
This is what I call a real pro

308
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,402
Great

309
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:22,831
Sorry

310
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,441
You touched it, you pay for it

311
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:25,608
What?

312
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,378
Why do you think they call it
the flesh trade

313
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:28,875
You said you wanted
to publish a magazine

314
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,378
I just taught you an important lesson

315
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,218
Pay up

316
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:36,153
You guys keep this in mind

317
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,652
If you want to publish a Guide to Whores

318
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,222
You have to understand
two sorts of people

319
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,222
The hooker's and the customer's

320
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,519
Understand?

321
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,624
Understood, Big Ma

322
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:49,664
Thanks for the lesson

323
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,411
Take care of it

324
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,476
I hear you're the expert
in getting women to undress

325
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,850
Only women I know

326
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,659
What do you guys want, tell her

327
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,033
Come on

328
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,869
Dance, then undress .. .

329
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,304
Do a little dance, then squeeze your tits

330
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,677
Touch your tits, then
squeeze your nipples

331
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,941
Take off cushion

332
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:12,616
No .. .

333
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:16,884
I have a shaver, need to
shave armpit hair?

334
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,617
OK?

335
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,051
Just relax

336
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,958
Yeah!

337
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,826
Come on .. .

338
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:30,557
Quick.. .strip .. .

339
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:33,737
Quick.. . Up .. .

340
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,873
Shoe .. . No Shoe .. .

341
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,838
Up .. . Quick.. .

342
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:44,411
Chair.. .Yeah .. .

343
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,015
Perfect .. .

344
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,716
Stop!

345
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:52,715
Don't go all the way, that's perfect

346
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,887
Really, then I'm not taking it off

347
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,292
What the hell are you doing?

348
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,094
You got us all excited

349
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,427
what are going to do now?

350
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,205
You're a man too, you know
what porn magazines need

351
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,171
Seriously, when we set out
to publish this

352
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,313
it was a monumental decision

353
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,604
to put it bluntly

354
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:19,511
Nothing can stop us now

355
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,378
Don't be in the way, brother!

356
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,750
I know what you mean

357
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:28,119
I'm ok to make some adjustments
with my art

358
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:30,890
I'm also a horny guy myself

359
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,992
But figure out a way to convince her first

360
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:35,798
Artistic maestro

361
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,231
have you ever been beaten up
during a photo shoot?

362
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,436
That's it, perfect!

363
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,236
Now I know pornography equals art

364
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,273
and art equals pornography

365
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,318
Good porn means good art

366
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,815
there it is...I can see clearly now

367
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,418
This is good porn

368
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,620
Perfection! Good porn! Good art!

369
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:06,861
Check this out

370
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,368
Tom's dick so long it bends

371
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,575
Nicole's oral techniques
are heaven sent

372
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,440
They start fighting but
have sex in the end

373
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,808
Finish this pizza and lick it again

374
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,581
Finish this pizza and lick it again

375
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,280
Imagine her mouth must be really oily

376
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,587
Finish this pizza...and just fuck it again?

377
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,626
Fuck it again

378
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,058
Fuck again it is! Fuck it again

379
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,922
We're all here, you're
the only one missing

380
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,097
Hurry up

381
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,993
Is that the one?

382
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:15,722
Can't be

383
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,093
Don't panic, this isn't it

384
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,327
I think it is

385
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:19,868
Go after it!

386
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,896
You're all here?

387
00:22:49,334 --> 00:22:50,358
Why didn't you guys get a cab?

388
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,203
Shut up, let's order first

389
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,268
Let's get Pork Bone Congee

390
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,599
Congee under this weather?

391
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,773
They're famous for it

392
00:22:58,143 --> 00:22:59,337
Fine, 4 bowls of pork bone congee

393
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,474
This is the area's leading
magazine stall

394
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,183
Should give a good indication
of our magazine's sales

395
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:07,475
It's extremely indicative

396
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:08,710
Is this a new magazine?

397
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,079
Just arrived, hot off the Press

398
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:10,947
Can I open it up?

399
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:12,349
Sure, go ahead

400
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:14,981
Look, a customer

401
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,125
It's really good

402
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,134
Buy it! Buy it!

403
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,675
Pretty hot indeed!

404
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:37,641
Buy it...

405
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,481
Fat Dragon and Boney Jones are in it?

406
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,182
I'll take this

407
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,614
Bought!

408
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,093
If Passion Magazine makes money

409
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,163
I shall donate half
of my earnings to charity

410
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,903
I'll give it all to my mom,
she still thinks I'm useless

411
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:02,267
I'll invest in printing
educational textbooks

412
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,601
Do some charity work
to balance off my guilt

413
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,341
I'll buy a bigger flat for Fanny

414
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,072
So we can live comfortably

415
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:16,551
Pamela dreamt of owning
her own fashion label

416
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,847
If I have the money

417
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,923
I'll use it to develop her label

418
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,589
Are we day dreaming or what?

419
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,194
I guess so

420
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,224
Sold out

421
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,160
Sold out?

422
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,124
$5 for newspaper

423
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:06,667
$5

424
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:07,531
I'm paying for this

425
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:10,840
Sorry, bro, this isn't for sale, it's my copy

426
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,239
Not for sale?

427
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:13,944
Sir, you're pretty old already

428
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:15,942
I would hate for you to pop
a vein reading this

429
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:17,910
Old men are still men

430
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:19,515
Frankly speaking

431
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,175
this is the first issue,
I want to keep a copy

432
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,318
It's an instant best seller

433
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:26,217
A mint condition first copy
will go up in value

434
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,115
They can always re-print That's right

435
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,619
You don't get it

436
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,296
When they do, it'll say
re-print on the cover

437
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:33,889
You're right

438
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:35,997
Careful, don't ruin it

439
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:38,901
Congratulations, mister

440
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,628
I won't fight over this with you,
it's all yours

441
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,362
Keep it well, thanks

442
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,132
That's right

443
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:45,639
This issue will be worth a lot of
money in the future

444
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,842
Trust me Yeah?

445
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:48,670
Even the plastic cover!

446
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:49,836
Let's go have some shark's fin soup

447
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:03,217
According to my research,
the first issue of Passion Magazine

448
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:05,827
sold over a hundred thousand copies

449
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,088
Wow!

450
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,163
It broke the record of the sales
of pornographic magazines

451
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,402
Because John and I used our heads

452
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,573
Previous porno magazines didn't
involve the night club scene

453
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:17,934
But we've set a different trend

454
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:21,373
We could make a nightspot
an instant hit

455
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:26,781
Your turn, sir

456
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,247
C'mon boy, your turn

457
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,045
Sorry, you all have to wait for a while

458
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,950
Not for long, I promise...

459
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:32,679
It's a busy day out here

460
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,153
Just hurry up

461
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,690
It's fucking John and Andy

462
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:36,586
We'll drink to that

463
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,589
Cheers Cheers

464
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:45,468
You guys sure have your ways

465
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,535
Now every girl in this joint

466
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:49,501
accounts for maybe 30 customers daily

467
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,867
Can't cope with the demand

468
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,538
Thank you both

469
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,680
If I didn't have the foresight
to see the potential

470
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,247
in you two

471
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:02,179
We're not going to hit the jackpot
like we have now

472
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,117
Our joint is literally filled with
horny sperms

473
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:07,052
Business is literally fucking good

474
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:08,890
Thank you for your compliment

475
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,652
Your precious teachings
worked out well for us

476
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,124
Nobody believed in us back then

477
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:16,698
Without our interview with you,
there would be no magazines

478
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,493
Andy, I know you're good at this

479
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,467
Help me get some new ideas

480
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,266
I want to fire up this joint even more

481
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,603
Let's fucking bring the house down

482
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:28,340
You guys must know how

483
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,445
Come on, stop keeping the ideas
to yourselves

484
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,272
You guys want to
bring down the house?

485
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:33,449
Yeah

486
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,348
You wanna have fun, we'll pay for it

487
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,748
Passion

488
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,823
Boss, this way to room no. 9,
watch your step

489
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,256
Maggie, hurry

490
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,290
Where are you going?

491
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:46,656
I'm exhausted Hurry up!

492
00:27:46,898 --> 00:27:48,092
Take good care of our customer

493
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,201
Come on, what's taking so long?

494
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,137
Jeez, this is so hot...

495
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:01,868
This is even better

496
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,378
Officer Cheung

497
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,083
Outside a sex den in Portland Street

498
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,288
We have about a hundred people
queuing up

499
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,687
Reportedly Passion Magazine
is treating readers

500
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:15,018
to free sex with hookers

501
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,315
Should we do something about this?

502
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,906
You two get on the van

503
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,074
I invited you both

504
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:41,008
Because you've gone to far

505
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,883
You wanna have fun, we'll pay for it

506
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,590
Officer, you have nothing on us

507
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,692
Yes, we consulted our legal adviser...

508
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:55,362
Right, having fun does not
mean prostitution

509
00:28:57,535 --> 00:28:58,797
But...

510
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,599
the newspapers today
reported about this

511
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:05,665
I got you both out to talk
things out on the record

512
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:07,935
So I'll have something
to show my superiors

513
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,341
What do you want then, Officer Cheung

514
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,182
I can't teach you what to say

515
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,811
You just need to tell the truth

516
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,788
You guys started a joke
with your readers

517
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,654
Didn't think they would actually
believe you guys

518
00:29:24,796 --> 00:29:27,731
As to what they did up in the sex den

519
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,025
You'll of course confess that
you don't know anything

520
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,861
Remember me, I'm SP Cheung

521
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,499
I hope you don't fall into my hands
in the future

522
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,842
If not, I won't be just taking you
out for a spin

523
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,671
I'll take you back to the precinct
for a cup of coffee

524
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:44,643
Understood

525
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,187
Where are you guys,
why are you not here yet?

526
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,286
Come on

527
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,559
Sorry...

528
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,734
We're late, sorry

529
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,129
The big boss is waiting

530
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,429
Thanks

531
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:13,844
Sorry

532
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,375
Mr. Tong Fook, really sorry

533
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,080
You said to proceed to Comewell

534
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:18,406
I thought I heard you say
the supermarket next door

535
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:19,878
Waited there for 30 minutes

536
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,676
It's true, we haven't had dinner yet

537
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,486
You two idiots wrote bad things
about our joint

538
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,820
We didn't

539
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,459
Seriously, Mr. Tong

540
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:33,162
We always tell the truth, nothing less

541
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:34,194
Yes

542
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,928
Up yours!

543
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,329
Of course you did!

544
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,601
You don't know who I am, do you?

545
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:48,435
Let me show you something interesting

546
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:53,913
This scar runs from my chest to my ass

547
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,476
Long time ago

548
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:00,353
Someone tried to bad mouth me

549
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,190
I asked them for a meeting

550
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,690
Every person

551
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,557
had two big cleavers

552
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,759
Cleavers!

553
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,669
This scar...

554
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:18,239
was a memento of that day

555
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:20,276
As to those fools

556
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:22,773
They were cut into 4 pieces

557
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,174
Fuck

558
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,581
Your joint sucked for real,
we simply told the truth

559
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,023
What the hell do you mean?

560
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,195
Shit! Do you know how
to run a sex den?

561
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,661
Don't blame others for
your own ignorance

562
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:42,432
If we die today

563
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,725
your business will suck just the same

564
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,196
Tell you what, I don't know much

565
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,062
But I know how to make a joint succeed

566
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,239
That's right

567
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:49,636
Assholes!

568
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:03,947
Look, I'm in this business
to make money

569
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,256
not to make enemies

570
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,621
Why don't we all sit and have dinner?

571
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,193
Let's all get to know
each other better, yes?

572
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,728
OK...

573
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,159
Give them some wine

574
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,071
Since it's our first meeting

575
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,775
I'd like to show you something
you've never seen before

576
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,409
My double blade technique
will blow you away

577
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:29,203
Great...

578
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:34,547
Really good

579
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,150
Brilliant!

580
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,879
Beautiful...

581
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,682
Encore...

582
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,794
Continue please...

583
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,504
Miss, when will Mr. Dai
give me my check?

584
00:32:54,772 --> 00:32:55,602
My employees are waiting
for their salaries

585
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,774
I realy don't know when he will be free

586
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,201
Don't leave me out
in charitable endeavors

587
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,503
Just name the amount

588
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:02,507
Sky is the limit

589
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:03,612
Mr. Dai

590
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,476
Do you know what was
my ambition growing up?

591
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:08,276
To run a charitable institution, seriously

592
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,418
Goodbye! Thank you, Mr. Dai

593
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,609
Walk the guest out

594
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:12,515
Mr. Dai

595
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:13,949
I know...

596
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,453
Shirley, get Raymond in,
we have a publishing meeting

597
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:18,025
Mr. Dai, I...

598
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,354
Can you wait a few more minutes?

599
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,289
I'm really busy, got meetings to attend

600
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,557
If you can't wait, come back another day

601
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,402
I need to go into this meeting Mr. Dai...

602
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:26,434
Shirley!

603
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,905
Unbelievable!

604
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,305
God damn it

605
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:36,503
This is what we're paid for this month

606
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:37,975
Why?

607
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,275
Why do we have to be
like beggars on the street

608
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,544
The magazine was a best seller

609
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,521
Fuck it

610
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:47,486
Why do we have to go through this?

611
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,254
Fuck him, we want our money

612
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,621
How much is his share worth?

613
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,263
Let's buy it off him

614
00:33:59,904 --> 00:34:00,893
Don't we have enough cash?

615
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,507
I agree, but I don't have the money

616
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,004
Neither do I

617
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,372
I got loads, but haven't earned them yet

618
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,012
Not me, I'd rather have
a smaller stake in this

619
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,116
I'll get a loan and use
my flat as collateral

620
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,581
I should also ask my girlfriend
to do the same

621
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:19,984
We should buy the magazine

622
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,351
You're my best buddy

623
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,258
John wants to buy Passion
back from Mr. Dai

624
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:34,466
He asked Fanny to use the house
as collateral

625
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,200
Yeah

626
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,666
That's risky

627
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,442
I tried to talk him out of it

628
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,772
How much was Dai's share in it?

629
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,714
He wouldn't release his rights for
less than HK$1 .5 Million

630
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:53,652
This flat was intended to be my dowry

631
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,558
What do you mean?

632
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:03,060
I'm betting my future on you, get it?

633
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,435
Do you get it?

634
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,398
Understood

635
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,470
Finally, we own this thing

636
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,107
Congratulations

637
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,646
Congrats

638
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,854
We can start kicking ass now
that we fully own it

639
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:30,183
This issue's theme

640
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:33,659
Camouflage girl in the jungle
takes a facial

641
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:34,694
Good!

642
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,857
Remember shoot on the face,
not on her breasts

643
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:37,997
Go ahead and do it

644
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,396
We'll show you the proofs later

645
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,416
I'm coming, please look at the camera

646
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,892
Two men? I don't do threesomes

647
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,759
We're reporters from Passion Magazine

648
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,363
Here to interview Titty Bird

649
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,031
Oh, reporters

650
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,564
Sorry

651
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,307
I'm getting the door, please come in

652
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:23,242
Come in, don't be shy

653
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:24,774
It's fine

654
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,310
Come on in, the place is crowded

655
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:27,978
Sit down please

656
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:33,147
7-up for you guys?

657
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,585
We don't get up 7 times that fast,
Coke please

658
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,221
Sure, Coke then

659
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,795
No coke or 7-up's

660
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:58,442
No soft drinks, but I have popsicle

661
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:01,049
But only one left, can you share?

662
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:05,115
Have some, it tastes good

663
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,621
It's ok, we'll help ourselves

664
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:10,349
I'll put it here, just take it

665
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:16,462
Here are our name cards,
I'm the publisher

666
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,527
I'm the deputy

667
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:24,436
Who's the publisher and
who's the deputy?

668
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:25,573
I'm Andy, the publisher

669
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,038
He's John, my deputy

670
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:32,012
How do you

671
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:34,047
conduct your interviews?

672
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:37,151
Just tell us your main selling point

673
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:39,346
And we'll take some photo's

674
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,490
My selling point?

675
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,593
I've said it all in the voice recorder

676
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:46,490
Can you say the same thing again then?

677
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:47,789
OK, hang on a minute

678
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,795
Here and now?

679
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,239
Yes, tell it to us, hold on

680
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,209
Boss

681
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,436
Call me Titty Bird

682
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:06,476
I have big, bouncy tits

683
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:11,017
40 inches of the real stuff

684
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:13,657
My cleavage is deep

685
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,191
My nipples are small and pinkish

686
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,623
I even "swallow" if you like

687
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,561
Body massage, 360 degree turn

688
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,961
I'll turn so good

689
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,797
like you wouldn't believe it

690
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:32,066
My pussy's tight and juicy

691
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,108
It'll suck you dry

692
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,213
And fuck you crazy

693
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,715
Only HK$300, really cheap

694
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:44,420
I'm waiting...

695
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,354
Does that work?

696
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:48,885
Does that work?

697
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:50,855
If it worked you wouldn't
have needed us

698
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:55,162
First of all, promise us one thing

699
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,797
You shouldn't be dishonest

700
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,226
40 in. bust line? You must be kidding

701
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,132
And all the service you mentioned...

702
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,341
Every other hooker
in the business does it

703
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:08,409
Do you know what's rule no. 1
for this profession

704
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:09,943
not to tell your customers
that you're cheap

705
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,876
If they want to save money
they'll just jack off

706
00:39:12,316 --> 00:39:14,944
Firstly, you need to hike up your price

707
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,486
I have no customers now yet
I should hike up prices?

708
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,089
Trust us, we know these things

709
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,517
You will become Hong Kong's

710
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,789
number one hooker

711
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,932
I've never dreamt of
becoming number one

712
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:33,625
Then put your faith in our two big...pens

713
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:01,593
Who are you looking for?

714
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,527
Titty Bird, as recommended
in Passion Magazine?

715
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:10,098
It's out?

716
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:11,365
See for yourself

717
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,605
You're pretty in person

718
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,474
Everything in it is true

719
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,048
Come in, I'll show you a good time

720
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:21,946
OK

721
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,385
I'm looking for Titty Bird

722
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:30,821
Coming

723
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:33,355
Come on in, Mister

724
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,723
You don't look like the picture at all

725
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:36,091
Stop looking at the picture, come in

726
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,267
I'm looking for Titty Bird

727
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,492
Just come on in first

728
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,368
Well? Should we try once more?

729
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,130
What?

730
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:49,145
If you couldn't make it the first time,
we can do it again

731
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,049
Have you had enough rest?

732
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,875
When you're done we can start over

733
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,519
Is that alright? Come on

734
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,847
I'm complaining to the Passion
Magazine for fraud against readers

735
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,383
The article talked about Titty Bird

736
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,788
But what I found was Shitty Bird

737
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:07,086
Completely different things

738
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,459
I am very disappointed
by this complete disregard .. .

739
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,261
of responsible journalism

740
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:14,569
If this is the case .. .

741
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,272
Then I refuse to support the
Passion Magazine from now on

742
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:21,434
And I will spread the worst word
of mouth about it

743
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,243
Titty Bird

744
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,451
Get here you lazy whore

745
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,953
I'm busy.. .don't come in

746
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:35,681
Just come back another day

747
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,949
Fine, I'll wait right here

748
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,185
Why don't you come in?

749
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,863
You have destroyed our reputation

750
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,260
Look at these complaint letters

751
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,661
They're all about you

752
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:47,530
Just come in first

753
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:49,466
Come in. Something wrong
with your eyes?

754
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,400
Come in and we'll talk

755
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:52,404
Fine, I'll come in

756
00:41:52,743 --> 00:41:54,938
Passion Magazine is in deep trouble
now because of you

757
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,613
Customers?

758
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,981
I'm not a customer

759
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,847
Who are you? Ronaldo?

760
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,256
We're robbers, Mr. Publisher

761
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,925
Thanks to your magazine
that pointed us here

762
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:15,631
Could you maybe sign an autograph?

763
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,458
What are your names?

764
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,430
Don't you dare tell him our real names

765
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,498
Whatever then, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho

766
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,531
Sorry, we need to finish off the robbery

767
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,706
Let's go, little brother

768
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,507
Thanks, Mr. Publisher

769
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:33,682
This way

770
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,411
Are they gone yet?

771
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,211
They're off

772
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:40,583
Untie me

773
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:41,347
How do I do that?

774
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:42,922
They tied us really tight

775
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,261
I'm so thirsty

776
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,360
What do you want to do about that?

777
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:48,687
Don't

778
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:49,996
I'm bursting already

779
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:51,757
It's painful

780
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,629
In a great hurry It's painful

781
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,206
Get something to drink

782
00:42:58,842 --> 00:43:00,969
You want me to drink condoms
and lubricants?

783
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,838
I forgot to buy some drinks

784
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,173
This is fucking unbelievable

785
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,051
Uh-oh, I have to pee

786
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:11,719
Dont do it, its pointed
right at my direction

787
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,056
I'm not thirsty

788
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,986
I can't hold it any longer

789
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,057
Let's untie ourselves first

790
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,351
Help me

791
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:19,754
I have to pee

792
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,160
What are you biting?

793
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,001
Don't lick

794
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,540
If you had served all your clients .. .

795
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:12,578
the way you served me just now

796
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:15,242
Then I wouldn't have had to come

797
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:19,013
Sorry, I got too lazy

798
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:22,157
I thought I could get others to substitute

799
00:44:23,193 --> 00:44:24,990
I won't do it again

800
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,294
It's useless to say these now

801
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:31,298
Why don't you write a formal apology

802
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,834
I'll publish it for you on the next issue

803
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:36,294
OK

804
00:44:39,376 --> 00:44:40,809
How.. .

805
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,410
How much do I owe you?

806
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,513
I'll pay you for it

807
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:50,380
No need, we're friends

808
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:53,722
We haven't even reported this case

809
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,619
Report what?

810
00:44:56,927 --> 00:44:58,724
This is my first time

811
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:01,658
I can't let others know about this

812
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:03,464
You have a point

813
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:07,266
Don't worry, I'll work hard from now on

814
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:08,935
I promise I will

815
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:11,666
I remember you said to me

816
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:17,278
that I can become number one
in this trade

817
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,748
Lazy Whore: My Mistake!

818
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:28,549
Titty Bird Promises never to do it again

819
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:29,884
Mr. Boney Jones, I strongly recommend

820
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,095
this girl, number 77

821
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,160
She's the best

822
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:35,864
Is this number 77 really any good?

823
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,693
Of course .. . if she was any good
we wouldnt need to promote her

824
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,926
Please do what you can to help

825
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:41,364
Turn the skank into the hottest princess

826
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:43,438
You know we don't lie, and
we don't accept bribes

827
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,901
That's fine

828
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:48,673
What's no. 77's specialty?

829
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,647
Blow Jobs

830
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,151
She's blows so well

831
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,445
that if she were a musician

832
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,347
she'd be in Kenny G's league

833
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:15,432
Mr. Jones

834
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:17,633
You've waited long?

835
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:26,712
I've never heard of anyone
named Boney

836
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,414
It's my pseudonym

837
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,248
Let's start the interview, your name?

838
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:33,421
Stop that

839
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,749
Tess Tickles

840
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,324
Tess, where are you form?

841
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,761
Guangdong .. .and Portugal

842
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,430
Yeah you look like you
have mixed blood

843
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:47,302
How old are you, Tess?

844
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:51,905
We'll say 19 .. .everyone says that

845
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,134
18 sounds too young

846
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,639
Vital stats?

847
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:03,083
36 ~ 22 ~ 38?

848
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,918
You think my butt looks big

849
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,214
No .. .

850
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,857
36 ~ 22 ~ 33

851
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:11,186
OK? OK

852
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:14,489
Any specialties?

853
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,630
What are you good at?

854
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,732
I'm good at everything

855
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:21,002
Except massage

856
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:23,302
What specifically are your
specialties then?

857
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,772
I prefer performing them than
talking about them

858
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:28,671
Don't tickle me

859
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:30,436
You've got to feel it
to be able to write it

860
00:47:30,747 --> 00:47:32,237
No need

861
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:35,681
How did you know that

862
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,750
I like doing it on the floor?

863
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,621
Cold .. .freezing

864
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,758
Hot! Too hot!

865
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:04,902
It's cold

866
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,475
Cold .. . hot

867
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:11,103
Hot .. .cold .. . hot .. .cold

868
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,946
Hot!

869
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,216
Tess Tickles' trademark
fire and ice technique

870
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,411
Boney Jones felt like .. . Give it to me

871
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,523
shuttling between the equator
and north pole

872
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,422
understanding the real pleasure
of oral sex

873
00:49:58,628 --> 00:50:00,027
Stop reading it, you fucking shit

874
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,261
This will go to print, everyone
will be able to read it

875
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:03,022
What's the difference if I read it now?

876
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,756
Won't matter once I finish writing it

877
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:18,737
Sorry

878
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:44,205
I have more

879
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:45,565
Do you now?

880
00:50:46,943 --> 00:50:48,535
I have .. .this!

881
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,971
And this, too

882
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,217
Fire and Ice technique!

883
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:56,476
Want to try it?

884
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,846

00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,891
Number 77, where are you going?

888
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,086
There's a long queue waiting for you

889
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,321
It's like a rock concert,
everyone chanting for "77"

890
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,533
Where are you going?

891
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,929
I need to go to the doctors

892
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,501
What for?

893
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:18,104
The doctor says if I keep on blowing

894
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,876
My jaws will lock permanently like this

895
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:23,102
I can't do this anymore

896
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:24,477
Bullshit

897
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:26,204
This shape is perfect for their sizes

898
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:27,178
If you don't do it, who will?

899
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,941
Go on .. .

900
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:30,517
You're the Kenny G of massage parlors

901
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,743
No one does this like you do

902
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:32,920
Come on

903
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:34,180
No, it hurts

904
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:35,119
Mr. Chan!

905
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:51,829
Andy and John, thank you
for coming tonight

906
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,134
It's going to be a blast, trust me

907
00:51:54,311 --> 00:51:57,246
Just call earlier, I'll reserve
the best room for you

908
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,315
We're ok, you don't have
to show us around

909
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:02,917
Stop kidding around John

910
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,745
Why don't I ask Kitty

911
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:06,215
to take our prettiest girls
to have fun with you

912
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,390
We're tired of looking at pretty girls

913
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,423
Get us the ones with special talents

914
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:13,157
Special talents?

915
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,038
What are you looking at? Scared?

916
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:29,607
Can you play drinking games?

917
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,641
Drinking games, can you?

918
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:36,207
I can

919
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:38,178
You start

920
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,384
Zero! Zero!

921
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,155
She claims to be the master
at this game

922
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:50,561
Start over Sure

923
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,698
I'll go first

924
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:52,766
OK

925
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,531
5! 10! Drink up!

926
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:03,708
Again

927
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:05,742
You're pretty good, why don't we .. .

928
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:07,747
go with 6 bottles

929
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,508
Fine, sure

930
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,558
I don't think hospitality is her strong suit

931
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:24,692
You bet

932
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:29,668
Come on

933
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:31,033
You go first

934
00:53:32,242 --> 00:53:32,901
Listen up

935
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:33,908
5!

936
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:34,500
15!

937
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:35,733
10!

938
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:37,143
Zero!

939
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,051
Finish that up

940
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,221
Thanks

941
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,288
Great

942
00:54:02,172 --> 00:54:03,639
I think he's done

943
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,106
No, I'm not

944
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,137
I don't believe I can't beat you

945
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,140
OK

946
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:13,538
Let's

947
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,116
Stop playing stupid drinking
games, let's .. .

948
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,417
play strip games

949
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:18,582
Bluff!

950
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:19,614
Why not

951
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:24,760
Off Please

952
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:26,419
Take it off

953
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:28,698
No

954
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,128
No? You were pretty confident just now

955
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:32,165
Off with it

956
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:33,597
Give me a chance

957
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:35,429
Chance? Let's go then

958
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,573
How can I leave this way?

959
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,166
Just go

960
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,604
Give me something to wear

961
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,675
Fine, take it off yourself

962
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,311
Now

963
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:46,412
Stop teasing

964
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,480
Let's go then

965
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:49,577
What now?

966
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:50,376
For real?

967
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,814
Take it off

968
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,144
Come on

969
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:54,749
Too good to be true

970
00:54:56,059 --> 00:55:00,257
Any girl could get on magazine
covers these days

971
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,793
Should our Passion try something new?

972
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:04,593
Let's get some ideas

973
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:10,865
I have one

974
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:12,939
We can do current affairs

975
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,167
What?!

976
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,273
You know I'm not good at these

977
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,039
Just trying to think of something

978
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,577
Why don't we sensationalize
our cover girls

979
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:27,650
Just get women from all walks of life

980
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:29,051
Then think of big stories
to package them with

981
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:30,123
Pretty good

982
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,351
I like this idea

983
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,597
We can maybe get a whore

984
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:36,559
a hooker

985
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,766
or a masseuse

986
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:41,266
and make her look like a lady, right?

987
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:45,264
Baby, I don't understand
a word you're saying

988
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:48,403
You won't have to

989
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,142
So long as the two of us understood

990
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,371
Who should we use for next issue

991
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:53,242
Who should it be?

992
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:54,812
Tess Tickles

993
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:00,779
Whose testicles?

994
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,053
Who's Tess Tickles?

995
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:04,620
Your Tess Tickles

996
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:06,154
Your testicles?

997
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:09,662
What do you mean my Tess Tickles?

998
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:11,964
Oh no, real estate prices crashing

999
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:13,294
She licked your testicles

1000
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:14,902
so she's your Tess Tickles

1001
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,568
Why did you get your testicles licked?

1002
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,774
When did I ever get you
to lick my testicles?

1003
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,280
You licked his testicles?

1004
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:25,980
I didn't lick his testicles

1005
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,477
He had his testicles licked

1006
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:29,309
That's why it's his Tess Tickles

1007
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:31,317
Why did you have your testicles licked?

1008
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:39,489
Yeah

1009
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:45,997
I need to call

1010
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:54,410
Tess Tickles

1011
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:56,743
It's my first time .. .

1012
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,012
First time?

1013
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,150
As a cover girl, I mean

1014
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:03,179
I bought some Macau egg tarts

1015
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:04,943
Not sure if it suits your taste

1016
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:09,018
I'm referring to myself

1017
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,685
No problem at all

1018
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,257
We have a professional photographer

1019
00:57:13,496 --> 00:57:16,693
Don't worry, my experience
plus this camera

1020
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:19,795
will make you look pretty no matter
how ugly you are

1021
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:20,934
Don't worry

1022
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:22,468
He's an idiot, ignore him

1023
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:27,006
John, tell her the theme we're going for

1024
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,637
The theme we're going for tonight

1025
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,014
is fruits

1026
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:33,772
This banana was made just for you

1027
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,746
It was modeled after
someone's body part

1028
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:37,452
Seriously, someone's
banana is that big

1029
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:39,018
Please take a seat there

1030
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:46,122
Can I take off my clothes now

1031
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,318
Sure

1032
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,495
I'll assume the position first

1033
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,638
OK, ride on the banana

1034
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:02,367
Like riding a pony

1035
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,047
Right leg .. . ride on it

1036
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:07,682
Raise your right leg

1037
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,149
Hold on

1038
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,383
Higher

1039
00:58:17,126 --> 00:58:18,957
Good, hold it right there

1040
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,457
open your mouth

1041
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,425
Iook happy

1042
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:23,188
Iook happy and slide it in your mouth

1043
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:29,535
I bit it off, sorry

1044
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,131
Yours did not come off, we're fine

1045
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:32,205
Keep it up

1046
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:38,504
Try leaning your head this way

1047
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,512
Better

1048
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:46,345
OK, that's enough

1049
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:47,545
OK, stop

1050
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:49,716
Let's try using a finger

1051
00:58:50,393 --> 00:58:53,226
Put a finger into your mouth

1052
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,323
Like this?

1053
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,098
I guess so

1054
00:59:07,644 --> 00:59:08,804
That's good

1055
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:14,015

You look like you've never
disrobed in your life

1062

Wait!

1063
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:35,404
Do it when we're on the bus, not here

1064
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:01,587
I love Hong Kong!

1065

Her pubic hair long enough
to reach the ground

1088
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:39,656
When she lies down

1089
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:44,764
her pubic hair escapes her underwears

1090
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:51,837
you can use hair gel to control them

1091
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:58,275

She lives on #59 Tsuen Wan Avenue

1095
