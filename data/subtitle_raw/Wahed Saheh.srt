1
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,200
<i>Yes, I love myself. It's normal.</i>

2
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,000
<i>He who has not learned to love himself</i>
<i>can never love those around him.</i>

3
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,000
<i>Those around me wouldn't have</i>
<i>found anything to love about me</i>

4
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,000
<i>if I hadn't found something</i>
<i>to love about them.</i>

5
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,440
<i>It's possible that I don't love them</i>
<i>the way they want me to.</i>

6
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,520
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>

7
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,320
<i>I did, truly, love all of them.</i>

8
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,840
<i>And most importantly,</i>
<i>I never lied to them.</i>

9
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,120
<i>And even if I had to lie to one of them,</i>

10
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,120
<i>I never had to lie to myself.</i>

11
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,960
<i>I love women very much.</i>

12
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,120
<i>And honestly, it doesn't bother me</i>
<i>that people say I'm a womanizer.</i>

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,720
You're leaving me to draw?

14
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,640
Leave that and come here.

15
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,240
<i>Why should I be just another person</i>
<i>in a woman's life?</i>

16
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,080
<i>It can't be.</i>
<i>There is no limit to my ambition.</i>

17
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,280
<i>If I can't become</i>
<i>the most important man in her life,</i>

18
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,440
<i>then I have to be up there on the list.</i>

19
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,920
<i>At least.</i>

20
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,320
You're filthy, Badr.

21
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,960
<i>We all experience conflicting desires.</i>

22
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,400
<i>Purity or decadence? Sweet or salty?</i>

23
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,440
<i>Love or hate? Good or evil?</i>

24
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
<i>We all lie,</i>
<i>and we all seek personal advancement.</i>

25
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,080
<i>I, personally, want to take</i>
<i>everything in life.</i>

26
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,240
<i>Aren't the happiest people</i>
<i>those who have everything?</i>

27
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,760
<i>Only an idiot wouldn't want to be happy.</i>

28
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,000
<i>And I'm not an idiot.</i>

29
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,440
<i>And I never felt like I was unfair</i>
<i>to any of the girls who loved me.</i>

30
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,920
<i>I never let any of them believe</i>
<i>that they were enough for me.</i>

31
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,320
<i>Except once.</i>

32
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,040
<i>Only one could make me give up all others.</i>

33
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,880
It's 12:00, and you told me
to wake you at 11:00.

34
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,760
Why didn't you wake me at 11:00, Mom?
I have an important appointment.

35
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,600
Your room smells like alcohol.

36
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,200
What alcohol?
Please make me a cup of coffee.

37
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,160
I'll get you a glass of milk
to line your stomach.

38
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,040
And you have to eat all the sandwiches
I made you.

39
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,960
<i>Abdallah hasn't only been in love once,</i>
<i>like he said.</i>

40
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,000
<i>Boudy is always in love, all the time.</i>

41
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,440
<i>I've been friends with Abdallah</i>
<i>for a hundred years.</i>

42
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,400
<i>Since we were in college.</i>

43
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,200
<i>We never hid anything from each other,</i>

44
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,640
<i>and we never got embarrassed</i>
<i>around each other.</i>

45
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,480
<i>When he fell in love with Amira Elini,</i>
<i>I was the first person he told.</i>

46
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,680
<i>And he was the first to know</i>
<i>that Fady loved me.</i>

47
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,480
<i>He always says that Fady and I</i>
<i>are like stepsiblings.</i>

48
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,560
<i>Boudy never hid anything from me.</i>

49
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,040
<i>If he so much as coughed,</i>
<i>he would call to tell me about it.</i>

50
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,520
<i>Sometimes I feel like</i>
<i>he's not just my friend.</i>

51
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,320
<i>Even my daughter, Rawda,</i>
<i>considers him her personal friend.</i>

52
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,160
I don't know how people go on TV
to talk about their work.

53
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,040
Hey.

54
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,360
-Fady, how are you?
-Hi, Mariam, how are you?

55
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,240
-Good.
-Karim Badr, the show's director.

56
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,760
-Hi, welcome.
-Hi, how are you?

57
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,760
-How are you?
-Good.

58
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,680
We realized that we'd met twice before.

59
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,320
-When?
-At you and Nadine's engagement party

60
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
and on your wedding day.

61
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,080
He was like a celebrity
on those occasions,

62
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,320
as if he were the bride's mother
or something.

63
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,360
By the way, I wouldn't be doing this
if Nadine hadn't forced me.

64
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,760
I don't know how to talk on TV.

65
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,200
Fady and Nadine are like my siblings.

66
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,000
I was the reason they got married.

67
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,440
-See why we got divorced?
-God!

68
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,520
Do you not know why they got divorced?

69
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,520
Farida Redie is almost here.

70
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
Dr. Farida Al Redie?
Eyad El Wardany's wife?

71
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Yes, correct.

72
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,840
Farida Al Redie's appointment's
been canceled.

73
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,760
-Canceled?
-Yeah...

74
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,920
Her appointment was at 1:00,
and it's now 2:15.

75
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,280
But she called ten minutes ago
to say she's on her way.

76
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,440
I respected her time
but she didn't respect mine.

77
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,600
And if you don't respect my time,
you don't respect me.

78
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,880
What do you mean? She's coming
from 5th Settlement in rush hour.

79
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,560
She doesn't live above her office
like you.

80
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,840
Mariam, Karim and their crew
also came a long way to get here.

81
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,080
And they made it on time. Tell you what,

82
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,520
if she doesn't respect me,
then I don't care about her,

83
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,800
her husband, or her business.

84
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,400
Well, we're going to start preparing.

85
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
We still have some time
before we start shooting.

86
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,960
So take your time.

87
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
I'll just need to talk to you
for five minutes before we start.

88
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,800
This is the biggest project
the company is working on right now,

89
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,800
and if Farida Al Redie likes our work,

90
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,800
new doors will open
for us to work with Eyad El Wardany.

91
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,600
What I'm talking about
concerns the administration

92
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,720
and finances of this company.

93
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,240
And that's my department, not yours.

94
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,560
And what's all this stuff
about a TV interview?

95
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,920
-Work is more important!
-Do you realize how often you yell at me?

96
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,560
And you never take into consideration
whether we're alone.

97
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,080
And you didn't think to stop making jokes
while they were here?

98
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,680
Are you not used to my humor?

99
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,560
You know that Mariam's
a relative of Nadine's.

100
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,480
Which means she'll tell her everything.

101
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,920
And so what?

102
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,320
Looks like your divorce
has made you a bit too sensitive.

103
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,240
You'll have to fix that yourself
if you don't want my help.

104
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,920
Farida Al Redie's appointment
is not canceled, Abdallah.

105
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,920
<i>Even if I was ten hours late,</i>

106
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,720
<i>they would wait.</i>

107
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,440
<i>I like to challenge men</i>
<i>like Abdallah Younis.</i>

108
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,120
<i>The game is a lot more fun</i>
<i>with men like him.</i>

109
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,920
<i>Boudy's reputation precedes him.</i>

110
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,080
<i>It's a small world,</i>

111
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,560
<i>and women like to talk.</i>

112
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,080
<i>Some say he's sweet,</i>
<i>and others say he's selfish.</i>

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,280
<i>Some talk about his cooking,</i>

114
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,240
<i>and others talk about</i>
<i>what he's like in bed.</i>

115
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,360
<i>And if Abdallah is a little crazy,</i>

116
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,560
<i>I'm a hundred times crazier.</i>

117
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,960
-Who's your role model?
-No one, to be honest.

118
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,440
Really? No one?

119
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,440
I like the work of some architects
and interior designers.

120
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,920
They impress me,

121
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,880
but I can't say that I consider
any one of them as my role model.

122
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,480
I want to be myself,

123
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,880
to have my own style that no one else has.

124
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,400
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

125
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,400
Mr. Fady or Mr. Abdallah.

126
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,360
Is there a common
style in all the designs?

127
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,600
I don't know, since I'm the designer.

128
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,400
But you can say that
it has to do with my soul.

129
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,560
And the differences are based
on the different tastes of the clients.

130
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,760
-What pleases me most is when
-Come on in.

131
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,360
a client sees the design I made
and thinks it represents who they are.

132
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,080
That must mean that you understand
the personality and taste of the client

133
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,640
-you're designing something for.
-When we get to post-production,

134
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,360
can you make her look better than this?

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,480
She's a lot prettier in person.

136
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,920
Truly, that is the best thing.

137
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,480
We've come to the end of our episode
with our guest Abdallah Younis.

138
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,560
Thank you so much for this.

139
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,440
Please tune in next week
when we'll be meeting another star.

140
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
<i>Of course I liked Abdallah</i>
<i>the moment I saw him.</i>

141
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,760
<i>Any woman would.</i>

142
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,960
<i>Smart dresser, attractive, handsome,</i>

143
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,640
<i>self-confident, successful, and dignified.</i>

144
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,360
<i>I don't know why, but I imagined him</i>
<i>at a wedding in a tuxedo,</i>

145
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,800
<i>with me next to him, of course.</i>

146
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,520
<i>He'd be a stunning groom,</i>

147
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,520
<i>and Nadine told me</i>
<i>his mom wants him to marry.</i>

148
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,520
Welcome, Doctor. Abdallah Younis.

149
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,360
-Did you have something to drink?
-I had three things to drink.

150
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,240
The doctor has been waiting here
for a while.

151
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,800
I saw you arrive,

152
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,240
but I couldn't stop filming.

153
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,120
They arrived on time, you see.

154
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,800
So you wanted to punish me
for arriving late, correct?

155
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,400
Of course not.

156
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,080
Thank you.

157
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,680
Why don't we get straight to the point
and not waste any more time?

158
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,560
Unfortunately, we can't.
I'm already late for another appointment.

159
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,840
Would you like to reschedule?

160
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,160
I'm going to Vienna this evening
for a medical conference.

161
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,320
Would you like to call us when you're back
so we can discuss what to do?

162
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,320
We'll see. Bye. Bye.

163
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,120
-Bye, Doctor.
-I'll show you out.

164
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,160
Remember how Mary Munib was checking out
Lobna Abd El Aziz in the movie?

165
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,200
Mom was about to give a walnut to Mariam
and ask her to break it.

166
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,640
Rawda, tell you what,

167
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,560
can we take a break so I can have
a smoke on the balcony?

168
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,520
So cute.

169
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,920
But really, what do you think about her?

170
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,880
She's nice, and she's a good reporter.

171
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,320
She definitely has
the wrong idea about you.

172
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,400
She thinks you're a gentleman.
Can you believe that?

173
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,600
Smart, gentle and a sensitive artist.

174
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,360
Things that bear little resemblance
to the reality of your dirty life.

175
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,640
She's a good judge of character.

176
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,800
I can see right through you and Mom.
I know you're scheming away.

177
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,520
And Mariam is the new candidate for
the title of Mrs. Abdallah Younis.

178
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,360
She's so out of your league.

179
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,120
She's a relative of mine.

180
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,360
-That's what's worrying me.
-The cigarette.

181
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,960
Hey, how are you?

182
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
How are you, dear?

183
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
-Here's your stuff... Rawda!
-Mariouma!

184
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,680
I've missed you.

185
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,680
She greets you exactly like she greets me.

186
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,920
-How are you, Mr. Architect?
-How are you, Mariam?

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,360
-Want something to drink?
-I have to be on set soon,

188
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,080
but if you make me green tea while I pray

189
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,760
I can honor you with my presence
for ten whole minutes.

190
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,040
Forget about your mom and me.

191
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,160
Look at the innocent little girl.
See how much she loves her?

192
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,440
In that case, I guess I'll propose
as soon as she's out of the bathroom.

193
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,080
Crazy woman.

194
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,720
I wouldn't want someone like
you for her, anyway.

195
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,960
She's perfect.
I'm not going to condemn her to hell.

196
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,000
Can I also make you some green tea?

197
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,360
My coffee is still on the balcony.

198
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
What are you looking at?

199
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,000
She looks good when she prays.

200
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Thank you.

201
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,840
So, you're not going to tell me?

202
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,080
Tell you what?

203
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,200
Why Abdallah Younis and Nadine
are hanging out with us so much?

204
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,120
Because they're coming to the movie?
Rawda really wanted to see it,

205
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,280
and I've been waiting for her.
You know that.

206
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,200
And the circus two days ago?

207
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,680
Again, Rawda. What are you implying?

208
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
I don't know. Maybe Abdallah has a crush.

209
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,120
A crush? On who? That's nonsense.

210
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,680
Or maybe Abdallah and Nadine are dating.

211
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,600
Dating? Could you and I date?

212
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,600
Impossible, of course. That's crazy.

213
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,800
Exactly. Abdallah and Nadine
are like you and me, siblings.

214
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,120
Rawda.

215
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,080
I've missed you. Why were you late?

216
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,480
Amira, it's been so long.

217
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,040
Where did you disappear to?

218
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,560
Life.

219
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,520
We've been around. Why don't we see you?

220
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,160
I'm a teacher now, and I have these kids.

221
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,760
-You got married.
-No.

222
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,720
They're my children from the church.

223
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,400
How are you, Abdallah?

224
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,920
How are you, Amira?

225
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,960
<i>It's like we broke up yesterday.</i>

226
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,960
<i>It didn't feel like five years had passed.</i>

227
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,640
<i>His eyes had the same sparkle</i>
<i>they did back then...</i>

228
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,520
<i>when we were in love.</i>

229
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,560
<i>No, I'm lying.</i>

230
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,480
<i>I still love him.</i>

231
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,360
<i>And I need him more now</i>
<i>than I did back then.</i>

232
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,760
<i>That's why I told Nadine</i>
<i>that I was on vacation with the kids.</i>

233
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
<i>I made sure he heard me</i>
<i>so he'd come after me</i>

234
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,280
<i>and I could see him again.</i>

235
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,240
<i>I'm weak and afraid.</i>

236
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,240
<i>Give me strength, Virgin Mary.</i>

237
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,480
I'll put this in.

238
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,720
Wait.

239
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,400
-Done?
-Okay.

240
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,880
Is this your "good morning"?

241
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,480
Are you kidding?

242
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,880
If you're going to fake ignorance,
I'll take my daughter and go back home.

243
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,280
We won't travel anywhere.

244
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,000
But your daughter wants to go on vacation.

245
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,520
Are you that heartless?

246
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,440
What a kindhearted man you are,

247
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,280
caring about my daughter
and her vacations.

248
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,640
I don't know why you're angry.

249
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,400
Because I don't like being tricked, Boudy!

250
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,920
No one could ever trick you, sweetheart.

251
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,240
You managed to free up your schedule
so suddenly,

252
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,320
and ditch the exhibition you've been
preparing for.

253
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,240
Then you drag your servant
and her daughter along to the beach

254
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,520
because you've decided to shoot
a romantic movie there!

255
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,000
Nadine, I've found Amira
after all these years.

256
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
You know exactly what that means to me.

257
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,440
-Am I late?
-Not at all. Go on, park.

258
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,000
Is this for real?

259
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,520
I figured you were going to be busy
showing Rawda around.

260
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,400
Plus, lots of magazines have asked Mariam
for photos and I promised her a session.

261
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,040
So I'll do an outdoor shoot with her.

262
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,400
Why did you think I brought my equipment?

263
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,080
All right, Nadine. All right.

264
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,560
<i>The first time Abdallah saw Amira Elini</i>
<i>was at the university cafe,</i>

265
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,200
around eleven years ago.

266
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,800
He fell for her instantly.

267
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,480
She fell for him too.

268
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,920
Even though she tried so hard not to.

269
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,680
This will look so good in the photos.

270
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,560
Why didn't she want to love him?

271
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,640
<i>Amira loved her dad</i>
<i>and he was her role model.</i>

272
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,080
<i>Suddenly, Mr. Morsi Elini</i>

273
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,440
fell in love with a Muslim woman
and converted to Islam.

274
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,240
He converted?

275
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,240
<i>He divorced Amira's mother</i>
<i>and married the Muslim woman.</i>

276
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,320
Amira's mother wasted no time.
She took all the children

277
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,120
and went back to Syria.

278
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,360
-And of course, Amira went with her?
-I want to shoot here.

279
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,840
Amira used her adopted church children
as an excuse not to go back to Syria,

280
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,880
but of course that wasn't the real reason.

281
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,760
<i>-It was Abdallah, of course.</i>
<i>-And her father,</i>

282
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,680
<i>although she did accuse him</i>
<i>of destroying the family.</i>

283
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,520
<i>And destroying her as well,</i>
<i>psychologically.</i>

284
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,560
She fell into a deep depression,

285
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,360
<i>until one day, five years ago,</i>

286
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,360
<i>she disappeared.</i>
<i>She changed her number and moved away.</i>

287
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,360
<i>Abdallah looked for her everywhere.</i>

288
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,840
<i>He even went to Syria,</i>
<i>but didn't find her with her family there.</i>

289
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,160
I've never seen Abdallah
so destroyed before.

290
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,880
Where were you? I looked everywhere.

291
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,880
Why would you do that?

292
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,440
I've missed you, Amira.

293
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,840
-Sure.
-I'm being serious.

294
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,720
Do you know how long
I spent looking for you?

295
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,880
I don't know and I don't want to know.

296
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,960
And you can't keep talking to me and
looking at me the way you did back then.

297
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,200
Everything is different now, Abdallah.

298
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,280
But to me, back then and now--

299
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,560
To you, to me, and because of
five years that passed

300
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,480
in which I chose to keep you
out of my life, Abdallah, it can't be.

301
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,880
If that's the case, you wouldn't
have stayed single until now.

302
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,920
Who said I did?

303
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,280
How would you know?

304
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,640
I have a feeling, Amira.

305
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Our feelings for each other
have always been real.

306
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,200
My feelings tell me that what
we had is only a distant memory...

307
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
A memory I forgot,
and don't want to remember.

308
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,520
I want to know why you insisted
that I come on this trip.

309
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,960
What do you mean "why"?

310
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,360
Okay, I'll be frank with you.

311
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,400
Why are you trying to get Abdallah
and me closer to each other?

312
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,560
His mom, who calls me every day,
wants him to get married.

313
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,040
He's her son.

314
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,680
But you know for a fact that he came
here for Amira,

315
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,680
that he loves her
and never stopped loving her.

316
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,040
Because I'm just like his mother, Mariam.

317
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,920
I'm dying to see him settled down.

318
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,200
I'm not going to say that he's
like a brother to me.

319
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,400
No, he's like my son.

320
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,520
As far as Amira is concerned,
he thinks he's still in love with her.

321
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,680
That's because Abdallah is very romantic.

322
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,240
But logically,
they can't be in a relationship.

323
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,360
He loved a hundred women after her.

324
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,720
Then why me?

325
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,480
Oh, really? It's because you like him.

326
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,960
You like him a lot.

327
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,320
Or do you expect me to believe that you
only came here for the photo shoot?

328
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,200
I'm very angry with you.

329
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,200
Do you know how long it's been
since you came up here?

330
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,440
Your office is right downstairs.

331
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,360
How come? Come here.

332
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,880
Come sit next to me.

333
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,320
My mistake for visiting you while your
son is away.

334
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Boy, I'm closer to you
than your late mother.

335
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,320
And you're lucky I made <i>mehalabya</i>.

336
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,720
Thank you.

337
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,200
Looks like Nadine's mother loves you.

338
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,920
But I've stopped loving her daughter.

339
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,720
Tell me. Don't you miss your daughter?

340
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,200
-I do, Bousa.
-Then make amends.

341
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,760
Do you think she believes
that you're abroad?

342
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,520
She's smart.

343
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,520
She knows something is wrong.

344
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,440
You've been divorced for three months,
right?

345
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,080
Four.

346
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,920
And why are you bringing up
this upsetting topic so early?

347
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,640
Rawda keeps asking me
when her dad is coming back from London.

348
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,320
And the bastard doesn't want to talk
to me about it at all.

349
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,600
Neither do I.

350
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,200
Then to hell with you both.

351
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,960
I only care about Rawda.

352
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,640
But you have to find a way to get along
with each other, and quickly.

353
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,440
If you're going to have your own problems
then you must allow other people theirs.

354
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,320
What? A few months to adjust
after a divorce is too long for you,

355
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,720
but you're still crying over something
that happened ten years ago?

356
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,040
Don't be so hot-tempered. I'm sorry.

357
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,880
You're right.

358
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,680
I'm always right.

359
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,840
Tell you what.

360
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,360
Call Amira to find out what she's doing.
Maybe we can all have lunch.

361
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,480
<i>I had to leave before they woke up.</i>

362
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,000
<i>I had to escape.</i>

363
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,400
<i>If I saw him again,</i>
<i>if he talked to me again,</i>

364
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,080
<i>I would have gone weak.</i>

365
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,880
<i>I've never felt what I feel for him</i>
<i>with anyone else.</i>

366
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,000
<i>I tried to trick myself</i>
<i>into believing that</i>

367
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,240
<i>I'd find someone who shares my faith</i>
<i>and marry him.</i>

368
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,720
<i>But that would have been a bigger mistake.</i>

369
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
<i>I can't help it.</i>

370
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,640
<i>I can't forget.</i>

371
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,960
<i>It's not like there's a button</i>
<i>I can press to forget someone</i>

372
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,920
<i>and love someone else.</i>

373
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,600
<i>If only it were so.</i>

374
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,280
I came back after finishing my studies.

375
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,040
Why?

376
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,280
You can't find people like this
anywhere else in the world.

377
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,760
They have a strange passion.

378
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,200
Yes, life in Switzerland
is more comfortable,

379
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,040
but it's boring.

380
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,560
I'm never bored here.

381
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,200
But people here are so intrusive.

382
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,200
Don't you agree?

383
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,240
No. Believe me,

384
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,760
you're the one who forces people
to treat you in a certain way.

385
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,800
-Not them.
-Eyad.

386
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,640
Come dance with me.

387
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,800
Go on.

388
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,320
Like I said, she vanished into thin air.

389
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,800
She's not even answering Nadine's calls.

390
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,880
-I'm going crazy.
-Good evening, Mr. Abdallah.

391
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,600
-Good evening, Hany.
-Good evening, Mr. Fady.

392
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,920
-We'll sit at the bar.
-Do whatever you like, Mr. Abdallah.

393
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,880
She's still wearing the cross
I made for her.

394
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,480
-What can I get you?
-Vodka seven.

395
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,480
-And you, Sir?
-Black on the rocks.

396
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,160
I'll only have one drink and go home.

397
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,040
When did you become such a downer?

398
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,440
How long's it been
since we had a night out?

399
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,480
Farida Al Redie and her husband,
Eyad El Wardany.

400
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,440
What? She's really different at night.

401
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,720
I'm going to go say hi.

402
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,160
You should come with me.

403
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,160
She's an important client,
not one of your sluts.

404
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,720
Let's go. Lead the way, boss.

405
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,800
-Doctor Farida?
-Hi.

406
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,080
-Doctor, how are you?
-How are you?

407
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,600
-Hi, Abdallah.
-Vienna was good to you.

408
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,160
Thank you.
How are you, Abdallah?

409
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,920
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

410
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,200
Eyad.

411
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,680
Eyad El Wardany, my husband.

412
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,120
Of course.
Mr. Eyad needs no introduction.

413
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,480
-Fady, and architect Abdallah Younis.
-You have done great work in Gouna.

414
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,640
Hefny Zahar's house.
Didn't you design that one?

415
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,800
Yes.

416
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,280
That's why I picked him
for the new project.

417
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,360
He's not cheap, though.
He's currently shooting stuff for TV.

418
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,840
-A star.
-I'm nothing compared to you, Doc.

419
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,200
Thank you.

420
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,720
Next time you visit the office,
the star will be available.

421
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,440
I don't like to talk about work
when I'm drunk.

422
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,720
-Call me and we'll set a date.
-A date.

423
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,520
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

424
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,560
<i>When did you draw it?</i>

425
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,880
<i>Seven years ago,</i>

426
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,440
<i>right after you went away.</i>

427
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
Daddy, daddy.

428
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,960
<i>I thought you were out of my life.</i>

429
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,080
Abdallah.

430
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,520
Help.

431
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,640
Why would you make that decision for me?

432
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,960
You idiot!
Your daughter is having dreams about you.

433
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,640
You're going to give her issues.

434
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,160
Nadine calls me on the phone and cries.

435
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,080
She's lost and doesn't know what to do.

436
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,000
Okay, but you should have talked to me
before! I should make my own decisions.

437
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,040
What decisions, you child?

438
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,640
I'm your mother, boy.

439
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,320
What did you tell Rawda?

440
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,360
I said that you're coming today
to see her at my house.

441
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
-And her mother is going to be there?
-Of course.

442
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,920
Because she has to see you together.

443
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,400
Read a little about child psychology.

444
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,040
Because you're responsible for you're
daughter's mental development.

445
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,240
Wow! Look who's talking.

446
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,760
I knew you weren't gonna let it pass.

447
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,360
I'm going to go make <i>koshari</i>
before I lose my temper.

448
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,680
You'll see Rawda, and Bousa is
going to make you <i>koshari</i>.

449
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,800
What else do you need to cheer up?

450
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
The one you need to thank for the <i>koshari</i>

451
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,280
is my sweetheart, Mariam.

452
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,640
I promised to make it for her
a long time ago.

453
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,480
-A long time ago?
-A bit of an exaggeration, Bousa.

454
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,000
-You've known her for a month.
-But she entered my heart right away.

455
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,280
I hope she can enter yours as well, dear.

456
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,920
Did you really invite her over
to watch the show with us?

457
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,440
Yes, isn't it her show?

458
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,760
So she watches all the episodes
at our house?

459
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,400
This is not just any episode, though.

460
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,480
It's yours, my darling.

461
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,880
All right, now go before I start yelling.

462
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,960
You rude boy. So rude.

463
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,640
Don't forget to call her.
Her birthday is tomorrow.

464
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,720
<i>Really? No one?</i>

465
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,040
<i>I like the work of some architects and</i>
<i>interior designers.</i>

466
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,720
<i>They impress me...</i>

467
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,320
<i>I don't know, since I'm the designer.</i>

468
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,640
<i>But you can say that it has to do</i>
<i>with my soul,</i>

469
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,320
<i>and the difference...</i>

470
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,240
Mommy, how is Boudy on TV when he's
picking up Daddy from the airport?

471
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,240
You both look great.

472
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,280
Right, Nadine?

473
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,920
-Yes.
-I'll heat up the <i>koshari</i>.

474
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,920
Call them.

475
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,360
Here you go.

476
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,400
What is this?

477
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,440
The gifts you supposedly got Rawda
in London.

478
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,640
-Thank you, man.
-"Thank you, man." What an idiot.

479
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,120
-Come on, we need to head upstairs.
-Okay.

480
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,880
I'll wash my face and be right back.

481
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,960
Quickly, don't be long.

482
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,600
This one is nice.

483
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,440
This one too.

484
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,040
I'll ask them to use it
because you said so.

485
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,000
This is so you.

486
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,040
Rawda.

487
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Daddy!

488
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,920
I've missed you.

489
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,440
Would you like to sit here
or in the office?

490
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,440
It doesn't matter, Fady.

491
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,560
What can I get you?

492
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,160
Nothing, thank you.

493
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,800
Nescafé?

494
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,040
Yeah, I know.

495
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,160
I don't know where the office boy puts it.

496
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,640
It's okay, I said I didn't want anything.

497
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,560
Here it is. I found it.

498
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,080
I can't do this.

499
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,440
Me neither.

500
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,960
But we have to.

501
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,480
I told Rawda
I won't be spending the night.

502
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,920
I told her I'm building a new house.

503
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,440
A big one with a yard and a pool.

504
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
She'll be happier there.

505
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,200
Is that true?

506
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,000
Yes.

507
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,160
I bought a house and I'm furnishing it.

508
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,800
Congrats, Fady.

509
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,240
Thank you.

510
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,000
I also told her to keep it a secret.

511
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,600
No one else should know.

512
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,240
Until I'm done.

513
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,600
All right.

514
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,960
But this is not the apartment
he'll get married in.

515
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,560
His is the one below this one.

516
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,160
But he'll furnish it

517
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,080
when he finds a bride
and they can do it together.

518
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,080
-Happy birthday, Mariouma.
-What? No way!

519
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,680
Oh, my God!

520
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,360
I want to film it!
Make him say it again.

521
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,560
<i>Happy birthday, Mariouma.</i>

522
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,080
I was so surprised, and I was like a kid.

523
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,880
I kept clapping for him to repeat it.

524
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,200
-That's so cute.
-Abdallah is amazing.

525
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,560
The cake!

526
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,000
<i>Have a happy year</i>

527
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,160
<i>Of course I know that Karim loves me.</i>

528
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,600
<i>It's impossible not to notice it.</i>

529
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,440
<i>I can pretend not to, I can fake it...</i>

530
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,800
<i>but I know.</i>

531
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,560
I didn't want to order the fish
and make him think I was showing off.

532
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,520
He won't think so.

533
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,480
He just doesn't like to eat fish
in fancy restaurants.

534
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,240
And honestly, it's better to eat fish
in normal restaurants.

535
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,560
Don't eat too much salad.
I've picked a great meal for you.

536
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,280
I hope it won't be too expensive.

537
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,480
So what?
We took a lot of money from you.

538
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,880
Right.

539
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,480
Now that you mention it,
we need to discuss that further.

540
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,240
Oh, no. We've already agreed.
That topic is closed.

541
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,840
Look, Doctor, I don't like to beat
around the bush.

542
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,560
If you want the designs
you saw and liked,

543
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,840
then you have to give me whatever I want.

544
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,160
Don't light that; the food is here.
Here it is.

545
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,840
Wait. Let me see who's calling me.

546
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,200
Hello?

547
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Yes, Dad.

548
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,280
I'm good. What's wrong?

549
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,640
Where are you?

550
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,680
<i>Did you know that I picked out your name?</i>

551
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,680
<i>I know, Dad.</i>

552
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,240
<i>Because of Suad Hosni</i>
<i>in the movie </i>Amira Hoby Ana<i>.</i>

553
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,920
<i>That's why I want you to return the favor.</i>

554
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,000
-<i>Return the favor?</i>
<i>-Pick out my new name.</i>

555
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,880
<i>They said I can't be a Muslim</i>
<i>named Morris.</i>

556
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,520
-Which room is Abdallah Elini in?
-First room past these doors.

557
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,960
Amira.

558
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,240
How are you?

559
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,520
I'm good.

560
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,440
Welcome, Amira.

561
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,800
-How is he doing?
-Don't worry,

562
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,680
he's in the ICU. Have a seat.

563
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,640
What happened exactly?

564
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,480
How are you, Amira?

565
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,560
I'm good. What happened, Ahmed?

566
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,280
A stroke.

567
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,160
It was sudden.
We brought him straight here,

568
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,360
and the doctor put him in the ICU.

569
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,440
We're waiting.

570
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,640
Want some tea, Amira?

571
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,640
No, thank you. I can't.

572
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,000
-How is he, Mostafa?
-He's a lot better now.

573
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,400
-Can we go see him, Doctor?
-We have to let him rest a bit more.

574
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,080
Please, Mostafa, let me see him.

575
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,240
As long as it's just you.

576
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,840
I'll come, but I won't go in.

577
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,120
-Me too.
-Let's go.

578
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,560
This isn't enough, Farida.

579
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,080
Five thousand pounds.

580
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,360
We need more.

581
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,680
There's a lot we need to buy
for your sister's place.

582
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,840
Shady, leave the doll and play
with something else.

583
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,360
What else does Batta need to buy?

584
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,520
Do you know how much you've taken
from me using that excuse?

585
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,320
-Everything has gotten so expensive.
-Yes, but I'm not a bank.

586
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,080
Now I get why you check up on me
and say you miss me.

587
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,080
Can't I visit you once, or visit your son
in the house I bought for him,

588
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,680
without you asking for money?
Don't you ever get enough?

589
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,640
And do you have to be rude
every time you give us money?

590
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,000
When did you become so forward?

591
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,520
You've had about 20 thousand pounds
worth of clothes from me.

592
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,160
They were hand-me-downs, not gifts.

593
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,800
You gave them to me after you
wore them out, Farida.

594
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,520
And the clothes you hide under the bed,
who gave you those?

595
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,400
I'm your sister, Farida.
And you're helping me, so what?

596
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,760
We didn't ask for a pound of your flesh.

597
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:39,360
Both you and your husband are very rich.

598
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,880
-So what's wrong with helping us?
-And haven't I been doing that?

599
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,000
Wake up and live like
your parents used to.

600
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,120
Or have you forgotten the dump
you used to live in?

601
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,520
-Are you trying to humiliate us, Farida?
-Let's go, Shady.

602
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Damn you for always criticizing me.
Let's go.

603
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,240
Aren't you going to give me
the rest of the money?

604
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,440
Yes?

605
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,040
I got more than fifteen calls
from this number today.

606
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,440
-Who are you?
-How are you, Amira?

607
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,000
It's Abdallah.

608
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,480
<i>Amira?</i>

609
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,880
How did you get my number?

610
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,800
I stole it from Nadine's phone.

611
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,720
<i>She said you didn't want me to have it.</i>

612
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,720
Which means I didn't want you to call.

613
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,000
Why are you talking to me like this?

614
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,080
Abdallah, please don't call me again,
for any reason.

615
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,480
Can you do that?

616
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,360
<i>Do you really want that?</i>

617
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,040
I just want to make sure you're okay.

618
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,600
I'm going to hang up.
And please, Abdallah,

619
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,400
I don't want you to call me again.

620
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,360
Okay.

621
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,000
I'm sorry.

622
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,240
Come on, Shady.

623
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,920
Change into your pajamas quickly.

624
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,680
Okay? And brush your teeth.

625
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,960
Okay.

626
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,000
-Does my husband have a guest?
-Someone came 25 minutes after you left.

627
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,800
-Are they in the office?
-Yes, I'm very hungry.

628
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,200
-Come with me.
-All right.

629
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,760
Didn't you go to your mom's?

630
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,160
-Hi, Daddy.
-Hi, sweetie.

631
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,880
Hi, Doctor, how are you?

632
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,000
Do you remember him?

633
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,760
He was at the club with us.

634
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,640
Of course I do.
I recognized him right away.

635
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,120
-We were in the room because--
-I don't want to know.

636
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,440
I don't care anymore, and you know that.

637
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,640
But I told you before.
Not in the house my son lives in.

638
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,080
Do you understand?

639
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,120
<i>Abdallah's appearance in my life</i>
<i>changed everything.</i>

640
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,120
<i>I'd become accustomed to the idea</i>
<i>that no man would be good enough.</i>

641
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,040
<i>No one could tell me what to do.</i>

642
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,360
<i>But that doesn't mean I didn't love Eyad.</i>

643
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,760
<i>Eyad was a decent friend during college.</i>

644
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,640
<i>I fell for him right away.</i>

645
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,400
<i>I thought of him as my savior,</i>
<i>and he was very nice to me.</i>

646
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,760
<i>He told me everything from the start.</i>

647
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,520
<i>He came out.</i>

648
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,920
<i>Yet, I insisted we get married</i>
<i>and have a kid.</i>

649
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,000
<i>Isn't marriage a contract</i>
<i>between two people?</i>

650
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,320
<i>I signed that contract with him.</i>

651
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,880
<i>A contract that turned me</i>
<i>into a lady everyone talked about,</i>

652
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,120
<i>in exchange for me completing</i>
<i>his public persona,</i>

653
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,000
<i>so people wouldn't talk.</i>

654
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,440
I'm the most focused woman in the world.

655
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,160
I focus on everything going on around me.

656
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,720
And I calculate every step I take,

657
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,440
and take responsibility.

658
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,400
My brain is working even when I'm asleep.

659
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,760
And when it gets tired and needs a break,

660
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,360
I drink a lot,

661
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,240
in order not to think.

662
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,200
And so I don't need to be calculating
to get whatever I want.

663
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,480
After my fifth drink,
I found myself calling you.

664
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,600
-Why me?
-Why?

665
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,120
Didn't I just say I don't want to think?

666
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:11,200
Don't annoy me by asking questions
that require a lot of thought.

667
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,520
Just so you know,
I knew we were gonna get here.

668
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,680
Stop being so arrogant.

669
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,280
Just so you know,
you don't know anything.

670
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,680
None of you do.

671
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,360
You just pretend to.

672
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,480
But you're actually in the passenger seat.

673
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,200
We're the ones driving.

674
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,080
But we give you a toy steering wheel,
and make you believe it's real.

675
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,560
All you can do, though, is honk.

676
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,080
We're the ones who think.

677
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,360
We're the ones who choose.

678
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,520
That's why we can't complain,

679
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,240
or hurt,

680
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,320
or feel regret,

681
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,240
or say "ouch."

682
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,480
Looks like you're having
a hard time, Doctor.

683
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,440
That's normal for me.

684
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,280
But don't worry,

685
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,040
I'm not going to ruin the night
by talking about the past.

686
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,720
I'll tell you something
completely different.

687
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,480
What can I say?

688
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,280
<i>During one night</i>

689
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,520
-Yes.
-<i>During one night</i>

690
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,000
<i>We tasted the sweetness of love</i>

691
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,560
<i>It all happened during one night</i>

692
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,040
<i>My lover and me</i>

693
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,640
<i>My lover and me</i>

694
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:44,560
<i>Basked in the age of love</i>

695
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,600
<i>It all happened during one night</i>

696
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,120
<i>During one night</i>

697
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,240
<i>A night, a night</i>

698
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,160
<i>We tasted the sweetness of love</i>

699
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:07,760
<i>It all happened during one night</i>

700
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,000
<i>My lover and me</i>

701
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,560
<i>My lover, my lover</i>

702
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,160
<i>Basked in the age of love</i>

703
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,760
<i>It all happened during one night</i>

704
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,680
<i>My lover and me</i>

705
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,960
<i>My lover and me...</i>

706
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,520
Looks like you're having a hard time too.

707
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,840
Is it that obvious?

708
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,600
Didn't we say we weren't talking
about the past?

709
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,480
<i>During one night</i>

710
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,320
<i>One night</i>

711
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:00,000
<i>We tasted the sweetness of love</i>

712
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,040
The house is beautiful.
Congratulations, Fady.

713
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,080
-Thank you, Nadine.
-It's not beautiful at all.

714
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,160
Bad taste and terrible design.

715
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,720
Enough with your dark humor.

716
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,440
I'm not joking. I'm being serious.

717
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,240
And why the secrecy?

718
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,200
I'm only finding out now that you bought
a house, decorated and furnished it?

719
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,240
Do I work as a waiter?

720
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,800
No, but it's my business.

721
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,560
I wanted to decorate it myself.
What's the problem?

722
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:29,400
That's why it's ugly.

723
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,520
I think the house is nice and simple.
It's very you.

724
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,360
Mommy, look.

725
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,200
Rawda's happiness in the pool is enough.

726
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,600
But just so you know, I'll be calling
you every five minutes to check on her.

727
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,520
-It's okay, call every minute if you want.
-Mommy!

728
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,240
See? She doesn't care that I'm
not spending the night with her.

729
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,040
I’m getting a beer. Anyone want one?

730
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,880
I do.

731
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,160
-Me too.
-Okay.

732
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,400
Why can't you be nice?

733
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,120
Can you believe he didn't tell me?

734
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,400
It's normal for him to be confused
and nervous after the divorce.

735
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,840
With you maybe, but why with me?

736
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,520
Rawda hasn't left the country.
She's just spending a day with her dad.

737
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:14,880
Nadine.

738
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,440
I can't sleep
without my daughter in my arms.

739
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,040
Can I sleep in your arms?

740
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,400
Aren't I your eldest son?

741
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,520
Can I ask you for a favor?

742
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,600
What do you want?

743
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,840
The restaurant people want my photo
for the brochure.

744
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,320
And a journalist who wants to interview me
also needs photos.

745
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,160
So it's up to you; either you take my
photos or I look for someone else.

746
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,480
<i>The strangest woman I've ever met.</i>

747
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,520
I've slept with a lot of women,

748
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,880
but what happened between us

749
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,720
has never happened with anyone
I've been with before.

750
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,920
I didn't understand the theory that
some bodies love each other

751
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,920
at first touch until we were together.

752
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,320
Change your pose.

753
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,880
This is what they call a perfect match,
my dear Nadine.

754
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,920
Every detail was just perfect.

755
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,800
Even after the deed was done.

756
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,560
Don't smile so wide.

757
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,160
Usually I want the one I'm with
to just disappear after.

758
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,360
But that didn't happen with her.

759
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,120
On the contrary,

760
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,120
I'd happily be locked up with her
for a week.

761
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,360
By the way, this is a very important
kind of love.

762
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,160
Love?

763
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,520
You're playing fast and loose
with the word love, don't you think?

764
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,320
Then later you pretend to be a broken
man who's only loved Amira Elini?

765
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,040
What about Mariam? Remember her?

766
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,720
Who's young enough to be your daughter
if you had gotten married after puberty.

767
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,560
Didn't you spend a whole day
teaching your parrot

768
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,920
how to sing for her?

769
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,520
Didn't you think a gesture like that
would get her attached to you?

770
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,040
How are you so selfish?

771
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,680
What about me, Abdallah?

772
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,160
Are you pretending to be a good friend

773
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:02,320
by distracting me from the fact that for
the first time, my girl is not with me?

774
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,800
Do you only see yourself?

775
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,560
Only think about yourself?

776
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,560
Standing here talking about yourself,

777
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,520
telling me your story
about your new girlfriend.

778
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,920
If you don't mind,

779
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,520
there are other people in the world.

780
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,760
And when they have problems,
like mine for example,

781
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,720
their problems are more important than you
and your different types of love.

782
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,120
-Nadine, I didn't mean to--
-We're done shooting.

783
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,400
Okay.

784
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,120
Here's Mommy.

785
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,240
She didn't want to spend the night.

786
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,920
I'm sorry, Fady. It's her first time.
Do come in, though.

787
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:55,040
No, I'm going to go. Here's her bag.

788
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,640
Do you know why I didn't have Abdallah
design my house?

789
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,040
So I can have one thing in my life
that doesn't remind me of him.

790
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,400
Goodnight.

791
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,600
<i>Abdallah is not like a brother to me.</i>

792
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,800
<i>He never was.</i>

793
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,200
<i>I've tried to think of him that way</i>
<i>ever since we met,</i>

794
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,880
<i>but I couldn't.</i>

795
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,880
<i>He loved Amira and she loved him.</i>

796
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,400
<i>And Fady loved me.</i>

797
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,120
<i>I thought I could love him back.</i>

798
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,280
<i>He's a thousand times kinder</i>
<i>and nicer than Abdallah.</i>

799
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,240
<i>I tried to hide it from Fady,</i>

800
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,920
<i>but he sensed it, because he's not stupid.</i>

801
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,720
<i>Even though no one loved me</i>
<i>as much as Fady did...</i>

802
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,880
<i>I never wanted to be the reason</i>

803
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,280
<i>that Abdallah and Fady fell out.</i>

804
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,560
Where did you get that Virgin Mary statue?

805
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,760
It was a gift.

806
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,360
A gift.

807
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,360
From a woman, of course.

808
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,960
The one I loved most.

809
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,000
Do you know that I've known we were
going to get here since the day I met you?

810
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,960
I had heard a lot about your cooking.

811
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,720
What did you hear?

812
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,840
I heard it was good, and spicy.

813
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,280
And that when you're in a good mood,

814
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,080
you like to cook for your girlfriends.

815
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,760
What else?

816
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,520
That doesn't matter.

817
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,280
Because what I've seen is much better.

818
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,560
-What kind of pasta?
-Forget the pasta.

819
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,680
Should I prep Madam Abla, Doctor?

820
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,560
-Give me five minutes to have a smoke.
-All right.

821
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,120
This is not good.

822
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,320
I kept thinking about your pasta
while I was in surgery.

823
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,880
Wait till you try the risotto.

824
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,800
I'll start the rice around 2:00 p.m.

825
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,080
Is that a good time for rice?

826
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,600
Yes, today. You have to eat it fresh.

827
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,120
Come in.

828
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,520
-Good morning.
-Good morning... Hey, I have to go.

829
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,120
-Bye.
-How are you?

830
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,800
Hey, Mariam. How are you?

831
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,440
Even though you've been ignoring
me for a while,

832
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,240
not answering my calls or calling me back,

833
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,960
I still thought I'd be the bigger person.

834
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,440
The Farida El Redie project is
keeping me and the company busy.

835
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,520
Not to mention the restaurant opening.

836
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,720
I don't care about any of that.
I'm here to use you.

837
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:47,400
Oh no.

838
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,240
Daddy got the beach house
we reserved in Ain El Sokhna

839
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,560
and he decided
to start working on it right away.

840
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,320
I told him to leave it to me.

841
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,840
I bet him that I could convince you,

842
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,400
even though you're busy with Farida's
project and your exhibition,

843
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,440
to ditch it all
and work on our beach house.

844
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,600
So that's why you're taking my mother out,

845
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,400
and taking her to all the shopping malls!

846
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,920
You spoil her.

847
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,560
No, there is another reason behind that.

848
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,600
What is it?

849
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,160
Bousa and I are friends. What else?

850
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,280
I don't mind helping you win your bet.

851
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,800
-Really?
-On one condition.

852
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,040
-What?
-Help me make up with Nadine.

853
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,160
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

854
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,440
<i>Her name is Aida.</i>

855
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,320
<i>She has a son and a daughter.</i>

856
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,520
<i>You will like them.</i>

857
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,160
<i>You will consider her a mother,</i>
<i>and them, siblings.</i>

858
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,000
<i>Impossible. She wouldn't be my mother</i>
<i>even if she was Mother Teresa,</i>

859
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,760
<i>and they'll never be my siblings,</i>

860
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:46,640
<i>because we don't share the same religion.</i>

861
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,120
<i>Does that mean I'm no longer your father</i>

862
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,360
<i>because we don't share</i>
<i>the same faith anymore?</i>

863
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,080
<i>Sorry if I'm bothering you.</i>

864
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,960
<i>But I wanted to remind you that</i>
<i>I'm always waiting for you.</i>

865
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,200
No perfectionism, please, Nadine.

866
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,600
I want to talk,
and you're the only one who gets me.

867
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,360
I'm a perfectionist, Abdallah?

868
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,800
Do you really think that?

869
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,200
I'm such a devil these days.

870
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,320
Women are all over me right now,

871
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,080
and I feel like I want
to try all of them.

872
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,560
Since you began by admitting
you're a devil,

873
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,000
that you're greedy and horrible,

874
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,680
I think we can come to an agreement.

875
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:33,240
My "perfect match"
has become an addiction.

876
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,680
I can see her every day,

877
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,440
and every time is like the first time.

878
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,440
Yet when I see the sparkle
in Mariam's eyes,

879
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,800
how she treats Rawda,
and her parents, who remind me of mine,

880
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,800
I think that if I ever do get married,

881
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,160
I won't find a better mother
for my children than her.

882
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,440
Not to mention,

883
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,240
Amira is on my mind all the time.

884
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,080
Follow me to the kitchen.

885
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,520
You only consider Amira to be your
biggest regret, Abdallah,

886
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,440
because it ended with her
before you decided to end it.

887
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,720
Maybe you're right.

888
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,360
And maybe you're wrong.

889
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,480
I'm never wrong.

890
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,080
I never feel good
unless I'm talking to you.

891
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,360
When are you planning on growing up,
you man-baby?

892
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,440
When I find someone that gives me
the peace I find with Mariam,

893
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,680
and the happiness I find with
"Mrs. Perfect,"

894
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,200
and someone to love like I love Amira.

895
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,240
Your late father can send her
down from heaven to you.

896
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,680
Oh, and she has to understand me
like you do.

897
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,800
Shouldn't you call Mariam and Rawda
to come back?

898
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,160
Enough time on the swings.

899
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,400
Thank you.

900
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,640
-What do you mean you don't know?
-I'm confused, Karim.

901
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,960
I feel like I want to see him every day,

902
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,680
I don't get bored of him,

903
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,360
my parents liked him a lot,

904
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,040
he's on my mind a lot.

905
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,280
But that doesn't mean I love him,
of course.

906
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,640
But you do, Mariam.

907
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,800
You love him.

908
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,040
-Something wrong with the car, Ma'am?
-No, Hassan.

909
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,280
-You can go to bed.
-There's no one in the house.

910
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,400
-I know. You can go to bed.
-All right.

911
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,040
Quickly, quickly.

912
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,680
-Give me a kiss.
-You're crazy.

913
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,520
I don't understand myself right now.

914
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:45,880
Why?

915
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,160
Why? I emptied the entire house

916
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,840
so that you could come.

917
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,040
I let my son travel with his dad
for the first time without me.

918
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:02,520
Well, you know that I
was smuggled in a car,

919
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,120
like a thief.

920
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,320
Do you know what that means?

921
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,640
I love being crazy with you.

922
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,800
Abdallah.

923
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,400
I'm thinking of a design with this style.

924
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,360
What's this? These are children's rooms.

925
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,960
What can I do? This is how I see you.

926
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,440
I swear to you, I'm not a kid.

927
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:31,160
People my age have kids already.

928
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,000
It has nothing to do with age.

929
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,520
Even if you were 90 years old,

930
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,840
you'd still be a kid.

931
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,960
-It's a good thing.
-Are you flirting with me?

932
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:42,320
Are you shy?

933
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,840
Didn't you say your designs depend
on the soul of the clients?

934
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,440
So focus on my soul.

935
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,800
There's more than childhood.

936
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,800
-Really?
-Yeah.

937
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,840
I want to ask you something but I'm
too embarrassed to ask.

938
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,960
I don't allow journalists
to know about my private life.

939
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,480
And what are you hiding?

940
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,400
Shyness or curiosity?

941
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,200
Ask.

942
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,240
I imagine you think of me

943
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,960
as a nice friend or a young girl,

944
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,720
or whatever.

945
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,000
But the question is,

946
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,880
how do you think I see you?

947
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,480
That's a hard question.

948
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:39,760
Take your time
and think about your answer.

949
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,640
When you find it, call me.

950
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,120
Hello.

951
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,320
What?

952
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,240
<i>If I thought you loved me</i>
<i>just because I was a Christian,</i>

953
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,800
<i>I would have been scared that</i>
<i>you might hate me.</i>

954
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:19,800
"In the name of Allah the Merciful,
O satisfied soul,

955
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,800
return to your Lord well pleased,
well pleasing.

956
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,960
Join My worshipers and enter My Paradise!"

957
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,880
<i>Islam says "Allah does not</i>
<i>look at your appearance,</i>

958
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,640
<i>He looks at your hearts."</i>

959
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,040
<i>Christianity says "God is love."</i>

960
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,680
<i>In every religion, God tells us</i>
<i>to love with our hearts.</i>

961
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,800
Amira.

962
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,200
Your silence worries me.

963
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,480
I don't know how to thank you for all
you've done since my dad passed.

964
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,800
Thank me?

965
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,640
I thought we were beyond that.

966
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,760
Back in college,

967
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,280
I was in love with a girl.

968
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,440
When we used to ditch classes,
she'd always bring me here.

969
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,360
I can't take any pressure, Abdallah.

970
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,480
I'm not okay.

971
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,160
And I don't want to pressure you, love.

972
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,200
Amira, I'm willing to do anything for you.

973
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,000
I just want to see you happy.

974
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,120
What do you think of this wrapping?

975
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,440
Very impressive.

976
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,360
Seems like we'll be getting
some good news soon.

977
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,520
-Nermin, leave us for a bit.
-Excuse me.

978
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,960
Do you know how long
I've been looking for you?

979
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,200
Fady, consider me on vacation.
I haven't had one for a very long time.

980
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,520
What vacation? We have work to do.

981
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:49,800
I'm sorry, Fady. Later, later.

982
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,880
I picked out the ring,

983
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,560
asked Nermin to wrap it,

984
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,720
and I went to her.

985
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,200
As soon as I saw her I got too scared,
for fear that I would upset her again.

986
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,000
Mariam asked me about you
a couple of times.

987
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,120
Why aren't you answering her?

988
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,280
Rawda, let's see who can
finish their chocolate first.

989
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:10,120
Come on. Take it.

990
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:13,560
Did she really imply something
last time she was in your office?

991
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,040
I finished first.

992
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,040
-Rawda, how could you?
-Abdallah.

993
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,880
When the Amira situation goes south,

994
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,520
you get depressed
and I never know what to do.

995
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:26,520
Don't worry, Nadine.

996
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,320
You don't know how different
our relationship is now.

997
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,400
It's like the death of her father
has rekindled what we used to have.

998
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,240
She's not in her right mind.

999
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,520
If you had a brain
you would understand that.

1000
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,200
Stop calling me!

1001
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,960
Just twenty thousand.
The girl needs more stuff.

1002
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,320
I'll pay you back.

1003
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,800
Just like I was saying, Eyad, my son.

1004
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,440
The girl goes to work
then comes back so exhausted

1005
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:56,040
at night from shopping.

1006
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,600
The way you changed the subject when
I came was so cliché.

1007
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,440
Very obvious.

1008
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,400
See? See the way she talks to me,
Mr. Eyad.

1009
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,760
Since she's talking to you like that,
she must've been begging for money.

1010
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,760
She wants ten thousand pounds, right?

1011
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,520
Even though I just gave her twenty.

1012
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:19,360
But she's not going to leave here
until she makes it thirty.

1013
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,880
I heard twenty.

1014
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,480
-Really?
-Look,

1015
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,520
-I will not allow you to talk to me--
-I don't care!

1016
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,200
Stop being so repulsive.

1017
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,880
I don't like you getting angry
over trivial stuff.

1018
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:09,440
This is not the first time.

1019
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:12,280
I threw some money in her face.

1020
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,320
It's over.

1021
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,160
I've missed you.

1022
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,440
Oh! Me too.

1023
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,240
-You look beautiful.
-Look who's talking.

1024
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,120
-How are you, Karim?
-How are you, Nadine?

1025
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,520
I'm good. How's work?

1026
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,040
It's all good. How's your photography?

1027
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:17,760
Good.
I want you to come check out the photos.

1028
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,760
Yeah, I heard you're having an exhibition.
When?

1029
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,280
Very soon, hopefully.

1030
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:25,240
Welcome, welcome.
How are you, Mr. Eyad?

1031
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:27,520
-Welcome, Doctor.
-Thank you, Fady.

1032
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,480
Now I see. All this good work

1033
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,000
is what makes Mr. Architect so cocky.

1034
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:35,680
Why is he acting like
he hasn't noticed I arrived?

1035
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,960
I'm getting something to drink.

1036
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:45,800
-Mariam, how are you?
-I'm good, thank you.

1037
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,760
Can I please introduce you to my daughter?

1038
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,080
-Of course.
-This way.

1039
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,680
-What?
-What?

1040
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,800
It's beautiful and amazing.

1041
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,200
Are you going to be a decent person
and say hi to Mr. Eyad and Doctor Farida?

1042
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,640
You delayed their project
and they're there complimenting your work.

1043
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,400
Come on.

1044
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,560
Come with us, Nadine.

1045
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,440
Come on.

1046
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,320
-Mr. Architect.
-Thank you for coming.

1047
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:26,880
-Thank you.
-Hi, Mr. Architect.

1048
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:27,880
Hi, Doctor.

1049
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,800
Allow me to introduce Nadine.

1050
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,720
Of course, Mr. Eyad El Wardany
and Dr. Farida Al Redie.

1051
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,160
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

1052
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:37,400
Great job, your work is like
the Americans or the French.

1053
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,480
-Thank you.
-And I'm assuming it’s over.

1054
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,120
You're done and free to work for us.

1055
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,400
Or not?

1056
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,320
Excuse me.

1057
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,800
-This way, this way.
-Come on.

1058
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,480
Why did you leave me alone, Karim?
I'm nervous.

1059
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,680
He stood there and didn't even say hi.

1060
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,760
I can't believe you came.

1061
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,480
I couldn't not.

1062
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,080
I'm leaving. Bye, Shaimaa.

1063
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,600
-Bye.
-See you soon.

1064
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,880
Can you stop looking at me like that?

1065
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,240
I get shy.

1066
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:18,880
I can't do that.

1067
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,360
-Congrats, man.
-Thank you, Karim.

1068
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,360
Good evening.

1069
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,360
-Congrats, Abdallah.
-Thank you, Mariam.

1070
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,400
How are you? Excuse me.

1071
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:34,600
Let me show you around.

1072
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:46,000
He was so cold. Isn't it enough that
he disappeared after our last talk?

1073
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:48,000
He knows what I was implying.

1074
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,800
He showed interest more than once.

1075
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,440
But then I showed more interest,
so he's pretending not to notice.

1076
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,280
Why are you upset that he's pretending?
You've been doing it for years.

1077
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:59,760
Or did you think
I believed you just didn't know?

1078
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,480
I'm a bad actor, it's obvious.

1079
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,760
If you're willing to hurt me this badly,

1080
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,520
that means you're evil, Mariam.

1081
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,920
Very evil.

1082
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,680
Is Rawda okay, Nadine?

1083
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,680
For the first time in my life,
I thought about suicide.

1084
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,480
Your daughter is the only thing
that stopped me.

1085
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,960
-What's wrong, Nadine?
-I'm disgusting, Fady.

1086
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,000
For the first time today,
I realized how disgusting I am.

1087
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:56,080
I'm alive just to hurt myself
and those who love me.

1088
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:57,600
You.

1089
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,040
I ruined your life.

1090
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:02,480
I ruined your relationship
with your friend and your daughter.

1091
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:08,080
Even right now,
I'm selfishly hurting you with my words.

1092
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:10,680
Why?

1093
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:13,280
What do I want? What am I expecting?

1094
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,840
Nothing. Nothing is going to happen.

1095
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,800
Please don't be upset with me, Fady.

1096
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,320
You're good. I'm the terrible one.

1097
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,200
-Don't move.
<i>-You're crazy, Abdallah.</i>

1098
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,760
You're the one who made me crazy.

1099
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,200
<i>Plus, I can really picture you.</i>

1100
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,840
Sitting on a couch,

1101
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,200
<i>bending your knees,</i>

1102
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,280
wearing...

1103
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,240
wearing...

1104
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,200
beige and grey.

1105
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,120
Can you see me or what?

1106
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:58,720
I had a feeling.

1107
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:00,520
<i>I said stop moving.</i>

1108
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,160
You can see me!

1109
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,920
Someone's at the door.

1110
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:09,960
<i>-I'll call you back, okay?</i>
-Okay, bye.

1111
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,760
You were working, right?

1112
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,480
-How are you, Mariouma?
-Hi, Abdallah.

1113
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,600
Mariouma is taking me to the movies today.

1114
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,080
Finish talking to him about your villa.

1115
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:26,320
Then pick me up downstairs.

1116
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:27,360
Okay.

1117
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:45,320
I know you called me a lot
and asked Nadine to--

1118
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,000
Is the answer that difficult?

1119
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,280
You didn't find one?

1120
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,680
Or did you forget altogether?

1121
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,320
I'm still waiting for an answer.

1122
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,360
-Mariouma.
-I'm not Mariouma.

1123
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,920
Mariouma is a little kid.

1124
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,280
I'm not a kid.

1125
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,440
You're the most delicate girl
I've ever met.

1126
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,760
And if I want to be a father,
I won't find a better mother than you.

1127
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:15,760
But?

1128
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,520
There is always a "but"
after such a nice sentence.

1129
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,520
But what?

1130
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,280
I'll tell you.

1131
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,480
It's obvious that you
don't see me like I see you.

1132
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,600
I have to leave.

1133
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,040
According to my very generous deadlines,

1134
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,760
I was supposed to see the designs
a month ago.

1135
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,760
I know you're not amateurs,
and I don't need to remind you

1136
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:02,600
that other people's work depends on yours.

1137
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,120
Yes, Doctor, we're not amateurs,

1138
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:07,480
but the designs--

1139
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:10,240
Are you the one who's supposed to be
talking about the designs, Fady?

1140
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,880
Here are the designs.
A gift from me to you.

1141
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:21,800
We'll pay any fine.

1142
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,080
And we won't break any contract
until the doctor makes sure

1143
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:28,320
that we didn't cause her to lose a pound.

1144
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,520
Wait a minute, please.

1145
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,480
If your time allows, I would like to look
at the designs with you, alone.

1146
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,080
I know I lost my temper. I'm sorry.

1147
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,400
I couldn't control it.

1148
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,120
I've never been afraid to lose anyone
but my son.

1149
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,840
But I'm not your son.

1150
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:53,200
Or your husband.

1151
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:54,760
Or even your boyfriend.

1152
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,760
You know what we are
and we can't be anything else.

1153
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:01,280
I respect this relationship
and that it's a secret.

1154
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,960
But whatever we are, you don't have
the right to talk to me like that

1155
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,920
in front of people.
Or even in your imagination.

1156
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,560
I disappeared, Farida,
because I'm in love.

1157
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,200
And when I'm in love, I don't cheat.

1158
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,560
The one at the opening.

1159
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,080
The one with the cross.

1160
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,920
She's who gave you
the Virgin Mary statue, right?

1161
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,480
Abdallah, I love you, and you love me.

1162
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,080
You know that you won't find what we have
with anyone else.

1163
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:31,160
I'm sorry, Farida.

1164
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,120
Hi, Mr. Eyad.

1165
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,800
That's Abdallah Younis,
he was dropping off the designs for...

1166
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,800
Let's get married, Amira.

1167
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,520
-That suddenly?
-It's not sudden.

1168
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:12,680
We've been in love for eleven years.

1169
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,520
Even when we weren't together,

1170
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,440
you couldn't love anyone else
and I couldn't either.

1171
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,520
But the reason we broke up
is still there, Abdallah.

1172
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,480
-It will always be there.
-Don't lie to yourself, Amira.

1173
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,920
There is no reason
that can stop us from loving each other.

1174
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,640
Abdallah.

1175
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:32,080
You promised to be by my side
without any pressure or commitment.

1176
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,360
I'm not pressuring you,

1177
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,200
but I really do need you.

1178
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:37,200
And I can't commit this sin.

1179
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,800
-Sin?
-Yes, sin.

1180
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,080
Unforgivable.

1181
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,160
Amira, if you want to keep your religion,
I don't mind.

1182
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,080
This doesn't exist in my religion.

1183
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,520
And I love my religion and I abide by it.

1184
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:49,720
And I'll always respect it.

1185
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:53,200
Can you promise not to want kids
if we get married?

1186
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,880
Can you? What about that?

1187
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,440
Could you accept it if our kids
adopted my religion?

1188
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,120
-The Sharia doesn't allow it.
-The Sharia is yours, not mine.

1189
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,920
Your religion is not mine.

1190
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,840
I can't have kids

1191
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,680
and repeat the tragedy I had with my dad.

1192
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,280
It's not true that you're
not pressuring me, Abdallah.

1193
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,480
You're pressuring me greatly.

1194
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,640
And I can't take any more pain.

1195
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,800
It's impossible that God would put this
much love inside us just to torment us.

1196
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:24,200
Doesn't your religion
say that God is love?

1197
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,920
I'll die without you.

1198
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,280
Amira, I love you very much.

1199
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,920
And I love you more, Abdallah.

1200
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:38,560
I need you a thousand times more
than you need me.

1201
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:40,640
Then let's get married.

1202
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,880
<i>I'm a very weak soul.</i>

1203
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:09,120
<i>I don't feel alive except with him.</i>

1204
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,480
<i>My eyes love looking at him.</i>

1205
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,880
<i>My hands love touching him.</i>

1206
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,600
<i>I love his smell.</i>

1207
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,000
<i>I couldn't, Abdallah.</i>

1208
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,600
<i>I could never have made you happy,</i>

1209
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:39,600
<i>or been happy with you,</i>

1210
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,560
<i>if I lived with this fear and guilt.</i>

1211
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:47,120
<i>Don't look for me</i>
<i>because you will never find me.</i>

1212
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,960
What does this mean?

1213
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:53,600
Huh?

1214
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:55,080
What does it mean?

1215
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:58,200
She left this
and didn't say where she was going?

1216
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,160
What? She disappeared?

1217
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:03,160
Disappeared again?

1218
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,280
She can't disappear!

1219
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,640
Why did she come back
if she was going to do this?

1220
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,400
Yes, so that I go insane!

1221
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:18,520
It wasn't a dream.

1222
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,040
Didn't you see her with me?

1223
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,280
Didn't you?

1224
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,520
Nadine, you're hiding her inside and
showing her how much I love her, right?

1225
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,200
Right?

1226
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,240
Nadine, I love her so much.

1227
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,720
I don't want anything else in the world.

1228
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,040
I swear, I love her.

1229
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,720
<i>I will not be stubborn</i>
<i>and say that what I did was right,</i>

1230
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,680
<i>because you think it's wrong.</i>

1231
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,400
<i>And because, I swear,</i>

1232
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,800
<i>I don't know what's right</i>
<i>and what's wrong.</i>

1233
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,200
<i>But I can't live unless I'm happy,</i>

1234
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:30,200
<i>and I would never have been happy</i>
<i>if I didn't do what I did.</i>

1235
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,600
<i>I love you, Amira.</i>

1236
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,400
Do you want me to die?

1237
01:19:01,040 --> 01:19:03,080
Please don't say that, Bousa.

1238
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,760
If I keep seeing you like this,

1239
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,360
I will die from sadness.

1240
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:09,880
I'm very tired, Mother.

1241
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,040
I'm tired and I don't want to do anything.

1242
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:16,640
I wish I could hide
inside your belly again.

1243
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,800
In my belly?

1244
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:20,760
You're a grown man.

1245
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,560
A man. A good man.

1246
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,160
You always get what you want.

1247
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,320
But if you haven't been able
to get her after all these years,

1248
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:33,600
then she was never yours.

1249
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,560
And she never will be.

1250
01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:45,000
You have the warmest hug, Bousa.

1251
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:51,680
The hug of a devoted woman has comfort,

1252
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,160
company,

1253
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:54,760
memories...

1254
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,120
good days...

1255
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:02,840
and a lot of bad days.

1256
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,880
But the good days make you forget the bad.

1257
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:14,240
Abdallah, find someone to hug you,

1258
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,920
and then stay there to keep warm.

1259
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:27,080
-Looks great, Mariouma, congrats.
-Thank you.

1260
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,680
-The house is amazing.
-You like it?

1261
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:29,640
A lot.

1262
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:30,920
Thank you.

1263
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,360
I guessed you'd have finished your drink.

1264
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,800
You always come at the right time.

1265
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,280
That's not true.

1266
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,840
Your design is great.

1267
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:45,200
Thank you.

1268
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,880
-Why are you standing alone?
-We can sit down.

1269
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,240
You must be embarrassed
from all the compliments you get.

1270
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,640
-Can I tell you something?
-Of course.

1271
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,560
I'm sorry about what I said last time.

1272
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,720
I don't know how I said that.

1273
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:08,560
I shouldn't have said that.

1274
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:14,320
I shouldn't have blamed you
for something I'm feeling.

1275
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,720
You had nothing to do with it.

1276
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,240
But...

1277
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,360
I couldn't help it.
I couldn't control myself.

1278
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:27,320
Can I ask your father
for your hand right now?

1279
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,480
-Shady.
-Daddy!

1280
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:35,200
How are you, sweetie?

1281
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,240
Make sure we're free that day.

1282
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:41,360
Because we're going to the wedding.

1283
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,080
Come on.

1284
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:05,240
I can't come to the wedding, Abdallah.

1285
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,040
Rawda has a fever and is vomiting.
I have to take her to the doctor.

1286
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,880
No, Abdallah,
I can't have my mom take her.

1287
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,920
Or Fady.
And don't mention this to him.

1288
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
He's been by your side all day.

1289
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:21,520
Don't ask too much of him.

1290
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:28,480
I know I have to be with you
on a day like this.

1291
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:31,000
There's nothing I can do.

1292
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:34,840
Don't worry. Nadim, the photographer
I sent you, is better than me.

1293
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:36,360
That's not what I care about.

1294
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,040
I don't need you to take pictures.

1295
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,920
You can't not come.

1296
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,080
Have your mom stay with...

1297
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,640
Hello? Hello?

1298
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,080
We got cut off.

1299
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:01,800
Why are you so calm?

1300
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,080
Do you know what this means to me?

1301
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:11,560
She can take her to any hospital,
not necessarily to her doctor at night.

1302
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:16,000
And why is it a big deal? She gets fevers
then gets better all the time.

1303
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:17,120
It's not a disaster.

1304
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,600
Why are you so calm?

1305
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,720
Aren't you even worried
about your daughter?

1306
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,320
I'm not, because I know she's okay.

1307
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,520
She's not sick.

1308
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:29,600
What does that mean?

1309
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:38,960
Figure it out.

1310
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,120
What would make Nadine,
your best friend,

1311
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:46,440
the one who gets you the most,
and who you get the most,

1312
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:48,680
not want to attend your wedding?

1313
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,440
Not want to see you as a groom?

1314
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:59,240
Did you really never get why Nadine
and I got divorced?

1315
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:33,440
We're going to have to break up
the company.

1316
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:38,600
Congrats, Boudy.

1317
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,200
Go on, sweetie. Downstairs.

1318
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,560
Where are you going?

1319
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,200
My son and I are leaving.
We're going back to Zamalek.

1320
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,160
Oh, so you're making
a well thought-out decision.

1321
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,440
And it's final. I can't keep doing this.

1322
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,760
What made you finally make that decision?

1323
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,760
Can't you think of anything?

1324
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:22,760
Did you really want us
to go to the wedding?

1325
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:25,080
Was the groom your first or what?

1326
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:27,800
I loved him.

1327
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:30,160
Looks like he didn't reciprocate.

1328
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:32,600
Looks like he just wanted
to sleep with you.

1329
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,080
Divorce me.

1330
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,280
You're divorced, Farida.

1331
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,760
But why Zamalek? Go back to Kitkat.

1332
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,000
<i>I will never go back to Kitkat.</i>

1333
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,000
<i>And I will always be</i>
<i>Doctor Farida Al Redie.</i>

1334
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:53,160
<i>It's my right.</i>

1335
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:54,280
<i>I paid for it.</i>

1336
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:56,320
<i>I upheld my end of the deal.</i>

1337
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,240
<i>But all contracts have to end.</i>

1338
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,000
<i>Mine just ended,</i>
<i>and I'm not renewing it.</i>

1339
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:09,440
-Use this one.
-Yes, this one.

1340
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:11,680
-No, put it on this side.
-Can you leave me alone?

1341
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,520
-Fantastic.
-Can you leave me alone?

1342
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:16,800
-What's wrong?
-All right, excuse us.

1343
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,480
Go in the next room.

1344
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,600
We're sorry.

1345
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,320
You too, Mommy.

1346
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:24,400
I'm sorry.

1347
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,080
Calm down, dear.

1348
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:41,600
Why am I scared?

1349
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:43,760
<i>Isn't this it?</i>

1350
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,960
<i>You were dying to marry Abdallah.</i>

1351
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,880
<i>You're finally doing it.</i>
<i>So why are you so scared?</i>

1352
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:56,120
<i>I didn't even have time to find out</i>
<i>if Abdallah even loves me.</i>

1353
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,320
<i>Who would I be happy with?</i>

1354
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:02,760
<i>The one I think I love,</i>

1355
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,640
<i>or the one I'm sure loves me?</i>

1356
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:09,240
<i>God!</i>

1357
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:49,840
<i>I can't not be with him</i>
<i>on a day like this.</i>

1358
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,600
<i>I'm his best friend.</i>

1359
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:56,600
<i>A sister from another mother,</i>
<i>like he says.</i>

1360
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,040
<i>Plus, I'm the reason behind this marriage.</i>

1361
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,800
<i>I can't not be with him.</i>

1362
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,160
Damn it. We can't be late.

1363
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,640
Mommy, it's Boudy.

1364
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:21,000
I ran away.

1365
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:26,320
You're crazy, right?

1366
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,880
Have you just noticed?

1367
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,520
Your mother might die.

1368
01:29:33,400 --> 01:29:35,480
She would have
if I was the one who got hurt.

1369
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:37,280
And Mariam?

1370
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:40,880
She'll be a lot happier without me.

1371
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,440
I'm lost.

1372
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:54,320
Well, you've always been lost.

1373
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,240
Get in.

1374
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:57,680
I'll park first.

1375
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:01,560
-We were going to the wedding.
-Why are you still awake?

1376
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:03,320
Kids your age go to bed early.

1377
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:52,160
