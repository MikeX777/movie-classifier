1
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,240
When I first came to Sing Sing
and I went to B Block...

2
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,800
it's just like this feeling
that came over me.

3
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,360
It was dark. It was dirty.
It was gloomy.

4
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,440
And I remember that night
silently crying in my cell.

5
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,600
I was like, "Oh, man.
What did I do to myself?"

6
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,920
"What am I going to do with my life?
I got 20 years."

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,960
"What am I going to do?"

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,160
I remember my son coming up one time.

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
And he said he wanted to talk to me.

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,680
He didn't want me to get upset.
He just wanted to tell me...

11
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,960
that he doesn't like it
when people talk bad about his dad.

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,480
It makes him feel sad.

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,680
But he told me not to worry,
because it was just words.

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,080
And he was, like, eight or nine
at the time.

15
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,360
But he was telling me,
you know, it's just words.

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,720
And I knew then
that I had to do some...

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,400
I had to give them something
to hold onto, to stand on.

18
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,440
My mom...

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,960
She received
a lot of undue criticism...

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,880
because of the choices that I made.

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,080
Never once had she ever told me
to break the law.

22
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,200
Never once did she ever tell me...

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,000
to put my ambitions or my desires
above anyone else.

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,520
But when I came to prison...

25
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,960
even my own family was like,
the whole world was like...

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
"She did something wrong."

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,240
And I had to find a way to fix that.
I had to find a way...

28
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,560
to show her that she didn't do
anything wrong...

29
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,040
that she raised a good son.

30
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,840
He just made some very bad decisions.

31
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,440
I was in the bed one night.

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,920
And a poem came to mind,
Langston Hughes' poem, Harlem...

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,320
a dream deferred.

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,120
And I feel that
it described my whole life.

35
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,000
I know what happens
to a dream that's deferred.

36
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,640
It is not dead. It's not over.
It doesn't cease to exist.

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,080
It's just deferred,
waiting for its point in time.

38
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,560
I remember my mom always
talking about me going to college.

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,440
I remember my cousins
always calling me a professor...

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,080
because I wore glasses
when I was younger.

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,800
So I decided to give it a try.
I mean, all through my life...

42
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,360
I tried everything else
that was negative.

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,120
So I thought I'd give it a try.

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,720
And here, they can take away
our property, our personal property.

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,560
They can take away your radio.

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,400
They can even confine you
to your cell.

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,000
But nobody can take away your degree.
That's yours forever.

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,160
That's something that you did.
You accomplished that.

49
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,160
And it's something that, you know,
your parents, your children...

50
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,520
can always look at on the wall
and say, "That's my dad."

51
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,440
Are you in that class?
All right, go in and sit down.

52
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,600
Hudson Link is a school
within a school.

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,600
It's a part of Mercy College.

54
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,240
And the students get a diploma
from Mercy College...

55
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,280
that is exactly the same.

56
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,240
Their diploma
just says Mercy College.

57
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,280
We teach the very same things that
we teach in the normal campuses...

58
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,320
at Dobbs Ferry or Manhattan
or White Plains or the Bronx.

59
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,440
{\an5}It's just that it's at Sing Sing
instead of at the main campus.

60
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,480
{\an5}But it's the very same classes,
the same teachers...

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,400
{\an5}the same syllabus,
better students.

62
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,200
That's the biggest difference,
better students.

63
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,920
You walk into the classroom.
They're all in place.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
They've done the reading.
They're prepared.

65
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,800
And they're excited and interested.

66
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,200
And they really want to discuss
what they've read.

67
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,240
As a teacher, it's great.

68
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,000
So tonight, we're doing
Raisin in the Sun.

69
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,200
And I know all of you read it.

70
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,280
So you know, my day classes,
I assign them one act at a time.

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,000
And maybe they get through
half of one act at a time.

72
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,160
A Raisin in the Sun is about a family
living on the south side of Chicago.

73
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,360
There's a matriarch, Mama Lena.

74
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,040
And she has a son, Walter Lee,
and his wife, Ruth.

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Walter Lee's a chauffeur.
Ruth is a domestic servant.

76
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,000
Mama's always been
a domestic servant.

77
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,200
And as the play begins, they're about
to come into 10,000 dollars.

78
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,040
So let's start
by just talking about...

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,040
a little bit of background
on this play.

80
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,240
- Who's it by? What's it about?
- Lorraine Hansberry.

81
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,400
Okay, Lorraine Hansberry.

82
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,320
And where did she get the title
of the play, A Raisin in the Sun?

83
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,040
From Langston Hughes.

84
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,040
Yeah, how does that poem go?
Does anybody know?

85
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,240
"What happens to a dream deferred?"

86
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,720
"Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?"

87
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,600
"Or fester like a sore
and then run?"

88
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,920
Langston Hughes has a poem
that means a lot to these students.

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,160
It's called Harlem
or A Dream Deferred...

90
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,560
because their dreams are deferred
for a long time.

91
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,360
And it goes, "What happens
to a dream deferred?"

92
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,080
"Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?"

93
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,760
"Or fester like a sore
and then run?"

94
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,040
"Does it stink like rotten meat...

95
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,640
or crust and sugar
over like a syrupy sweet?"

96
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,880
"Does it sag like a heavy load,
or does it explode?"

97
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,560
So she could've taken
any of those images, right?

98
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,440
Why didn't she call it fester like
a sore or stink like rotten meat?

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,720
She called it A Raisin in the Sun.
Why, Raymond?

100
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,600
Because in the play, the dreams
that the main characters set out...

101
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,240
to achieve didn't get achieved.

102
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,160
And it kind of got dried up.

103
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,360
It dries up, but it's not rotten.
You still could eat it.

104
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,040
How long can you keep that raisin?
How long will it be good?

105
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,640
- Indefinitely.
- Forever.

106
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,880
Forever, indefinitely, forever.
And that's why she chose that.

107
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
Because the dreams
of the African Americans...

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,200
that she talks about in this play
have been deferred for a long time.

109
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,560
But they're not destroyed.

110
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,280
A lot of the tension in the play
stems from...

111
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,920
what are they going to do
with the money?

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,360
Mama has had this 40-year dream
of getting out of that apartment...

113
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
and moving into a house.

114
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,560
And Walter is desperate
to start a business.

115
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,640
Mama, look. Old Willy Harris
put everything on paper.

116
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,200
The lawyers just looked at it,
and everything is fine.

117
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,120
Son, I think you ought to talk
to your wife.

118
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,240
- I'll go out, leave you all alone.
- I'll talk to her later, Mama.

119
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
- Look, listen... Please.
- Son!

120
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,560
Will somebody listen to me today?

121
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,800
I don't allow no yelling in this
house, Walter Lee and you know it.

122
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,720
And there isn't going be
no investing in no liquor store.

123
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,400
That's his hope for his dream.

124
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,880
He's always scheming
on trying to make extra money...

125
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,440
trying to be this entrepreneur...

126
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,040
and break the mold of the
African American during that time...

127
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,240
during World War II.
And he's preying on his mother.

128
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,440
He's even going to use Ruth
to try to push up on Mama...

129
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,240
to get this money,
so he can open up this liquor store.

130
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,840
Why do you have to talk so much
about money?

131
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,000
Because it's life, Mama.

132
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,320
So now money is life?

133
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,400
Once upon a time, freedom was life.

134
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,000
Now it's money.

135
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,800
- No, it was always money.
- No.

136
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,920
- No, we just didn't know about it.
- Something's changed.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,560
You're something new, boy.

138
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,280
What does she say when Walter says,
"It was always about money?"

139
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,960
- It used to be about freedom.
- It was about freedom...

140
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,000
Yeah, who said that? Who said that?
Okay, Chi, go with that.

141
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,840
She said it used to be about freedom.

142
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,080
Because at that time,
when she was coming up...

143
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,600
money wasn't an issue.

144
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,680
It was like, to be able
to pick up a book and read...

145
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,200
things of that nature,
was farfetched for them.

146
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,280
And now that they conquered that,
she's looking at her kid, at Walter.

147
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,720
Like, "You're all about money.
That's not even important."

148
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,680
He feels, betrayed by his family,
his friends, by everybody.

149
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,320
They won't give him a chance
to live out his dream.

150
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,440
Mama, look at me.

151
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,240
I'm looking at you, son.
You're a good-looking boy.

152
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,200
You've got a job, a nice wife,
and a fine son...

153
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,160
A job?
Mama, a job?

154
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,640
I open and close doors all day long.

155
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,440
I drive a man around
in his limousine.

156
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,680
I say, "Yes, sir. No, sir.
Very good, sir."

157
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
"Shall we take the drive, sir?"

158
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,960
Mama, that isn't no kind of job.
That isn't nothing at all.

159
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,800
Sometimes it's like I see the future
stretched out in front of me...

160
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,040
just plain as day,
the future, Mama...

161
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,280
hanging over there
at the edge of my day...

162
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,000
just waiting for me, a big, looming,
blank space full of nothing.

163
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
He wants to be a better man.

164
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,800
He wants to be a person
who can provide for his family.

165
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,520
And these men get it,
because they want to be a man...

166
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,400
that their children
can look up to...

167
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,800
a man who can eventually provide
for their families.

168
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,440
These guys that make it
through this program...

169
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,880
have had to really work hard
to accomplish what they're going for.

170
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,120
They're working on old manual
typewriters with no memory.

171
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,160
They have no research capacity.

172
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,000
{\an5}They're living in the largest
cell block in the country.

173
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,160
{\an5}So even late at night,
the toilets are going.

174
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,240
{\an5}The radios are going.
It's never, ever quiet.

175
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,720
So when you're studying
and trying to read or do a paper...

176
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,920
and you're wadding up toilet paper
to put in your ears...

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,480
just so you can get some quiet,
it's not conducive for learning.

178
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
It's different
than my usual teaching.

179
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,840
Teaching out in the regular world...

180
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,000
people are going there
to get a degree.

181
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,200
They're hoping that
it's going to get them a good job...

182
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,360
and that's about it.

183
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,240
{\an5}They don't have too much stake,
generally, in any particular course.

184
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,440
They're just trying
to get good grades.

185
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,080
With the men at Sing Sing, it's
a whole different thing for them.

186
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,200
Many of them,
the stakes are very high.

187
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,240
They know that, for them...

188
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,840
it could be an opportunity
at a life outside of prison.

189
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,600
Getting back to the allegory
of the cave...

190
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:47,360
{\an5}the mind corresponds to what
Plato called The World of Ideas.

191
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,360
"There have been people who have said
they're getting this education."

192
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,560
"They're paying very little."

193
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,880
And in the old program...

194
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,960
when the state and the federal
government were paying...

195
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,680
it was even worse.
Because people would say...

196
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,320
"I can't afford to send my kids
to college that way."

197
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
"These prisoners are getting it
for free."

198
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,280
I think my response
has always been...

199
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,520
"These men and women
will come back to the community."

200
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,800
"How do you want them to come back?"

201
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,400
This isn't just a gift for them.
It's a gift for society.

202
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,680
It's a way that we make society
a better place.

203
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,760
My name is Joel Jimenez.

204
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,920
And I'm from Manhattan,
Lower East Side section of Manhattan.

205
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,360
It was 1992.
Several guys approached my brother.

206
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,640
One of them reached into his pocket.

207
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,560
And he looked back at the other guy
and told him, "Should I do it?"

208
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,600
So I panicked.

209
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,160
And as that unfolded,
I shot and killed him...

210
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,880
which what I thought was protecting
my brother at the time.

211
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
But the sad reality,
when the facts came out...

212
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,240
he didn't have nothing on him.

213
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,800
And it was a terrible moment...

214
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,200
that I get to live with
for the rest of my life.

215
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,600
We have two lives
that were destroyed...

216
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,080
his life as well as my life.

217
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,440
Everyone called him El Pollito.

218
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,360
They don't even know
what El Pollito means...

219
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,480
for those English-speaking people.

220
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,800
Pollito is baby chick.

221
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,760
Joel has a real flair for being able
to think outside the box.

222
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,280
You know, some of the questions
he asks in class...

223
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,840
are things that a lot of other people
don't think about.

224
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,080
Life in prison has been sort of
an emotional rollercoaster.

225
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,120
You have your good days
and your bad days.

226
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,000
When they're going for you,
things look great.

227
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,960
And then when things look down,
because you've been here so long...

228
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,880
it becomes very difficult
to be here...

229
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,720
each time seeing the life
you missed out on.

230
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,640
You know, his daughter
grew up without him.

231
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,960
And you know, and now
she's a teenager. And...

232
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,800
She was two years old
when I came to prison.

233
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,720
She was seven years old
when her mother passed away.

234
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,400
So my child had a rough childhood.

235
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,880
And it's something
I wish I could be there to help her.

236
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,600
And I missed out on that.

237
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,840
My relationship with my dad,
when I was younger...

238
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,360
it wasn't that good.

239
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,080
It's sad. I don't think a child
should have to go through that.

240
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,840
Now that I'm getting older,
it's like I'm realizing...

241
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,320
that you know, I have to develop
a better relationship with him...

242
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,400
not necessarily that I have to,
but that I should.

243
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,080
I guess it was just a matter of age
and, like, growing up and maturing.

244
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,320
Like, you know, you can't always
have a hatred towards somebody.

245
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,640
Because I guess I want as mad that
he wasn't there when I was younger.

246
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,840
But...

247
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,440
I missed out of so far,
18 years of her life.

248
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,240
And that means
her kindergarten graduation.

249
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,400
That means
her elementary school graduation...

250
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,040
her high school graduation.

251
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,360
Those are the things
that I missed out on.

252
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,760
He is doing something for himself...

253
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,520
preparing himself for the day
of his release, you know?

254
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,560
I mean, the whole family's just happy
that, you know...

255
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,680
there's something positive
coming out of this.

256
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,560
We're proud that...

257
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,800
We're proud...

258
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,760
We're proud
that he's made it this far.

259
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,480
I love you, Joel. And we are proud
of all you have accomplished.

260
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,840
I ended up in this fight.
And I decided to shoot this guy.

261
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,000
But at the time,
I felt I was protecting myself.

262
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,480
At the time, I was not
protecting myself physically...

263
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,960
but more of my dignity, my manhood.

264
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,480
I'm blending
some oil pastels together...

265
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,240
and trying to get dirty with it.

266
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,080
If I can't get dirty with it,
it's not any fun.

267
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,240
But it's therapeutic,
whenever I get drawing.

268
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,320
I lose track of time when I do so.

269
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,600
Obviously, we've got a lot of time
to use while in here.

270
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,280
I try to make the best out of it.

271
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,000
I kind of made fun of him
and call him Denis the Menace.

272
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,680
He used to love pranks.

273
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,520
{\an5}So he would do the whole, you know,
putting Saran Wrap around the toilet.

274
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,640
He sits and listens for a while,
gets the lay of the land before...

275
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,360
He's not somebody
who jumps in with both feet.

276
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,760
But when he says something,
it's something really of value.

277
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,160
It triggers conversation.
It triggers argument.

278
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,880
He was kind of a womanizer.
And that got him in a lot of trouble.

279
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,920
He brought with him a portfolio
that night of his paintings...

280
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,600
to show me, his sketches
and so forth, and all very different.

281
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,440
All very talented.

282
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,480
I got inspired
after reading Rene Descartes.

283
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,240
It's named...

284
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,680
which is, "I think, therefore I am."

285
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,480
But I added "free" in Latin,
just to complete that message...

286
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,520
of what I was trying to say.

287
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,200
Here is Denis. And he's in chains.

288
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,080
There another message saying that...

289
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,600
even though his body might be
imprisoned, his mind is free.

290
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,080
I look forward to the time
he gets out.

291
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,760
I think he'll become
a well-known artist.

292
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,800
My parents are hardworking people.

293
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,480
They've always been behind me.
They've always been supportive.

294
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,480
What exactly do you want to hear
about me?

295
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,080
Like, "My name
is Natalie Jimenez."

296
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,480
"I'm the wife of Joel Jimenez."
And maybe what you...

297
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,120
Yeah, because I don't like
talking about myself.

298
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,440
My life is really such a secret
and such a personal.

299
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,000
I mean, I'm my own personal person
because of the circumstances...

300
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:41,200
that when people ask me about myself,
it's usually, like...

301
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,440
I guess fantasy that I'm telling
about myself, like, what...

302
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,920
- What do you...
- I tell people...

303
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,880
that he works in Westchester.

304
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,560
Because I figure, he lives there.
And I know he somewhat works there.

305
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,920
We've been together 15 years.
I met her in prison.

306
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,080
She was a volunteer
in the Elmira Correctional Facility.

307
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,200
My mother worked
in the same facility.

308
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,520
And she told me
that she had a project for me to do.

309
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,880
And she was going to have
one of the guys help me.

310
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,600
And I said,
"You mean like an inmate?"

311
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,000
And she said yes.
And I begged her.

312
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,720
I begged her, "Please, I don't want
to be in a filing room...

313
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,240
with an inmate. Please."

314
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,000
"Oh, no. He's a nice guy."

315
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,240
And I was like,
"No, I don't want to be..."

316
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,800
Because earlier that day,
I had heard about...

317
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
an inmate who swallowed a light bulb.

318
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,240
My thought was that
they were all crazy...

319
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,240
and they all swallow light bulbs
and do crazy things.

320
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,520
So but then I met him,
and he was fun and funny...

321
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,560
and nice and regular.

322
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,400
Dating in prison, it's not easy.

323
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,320
Because you only get to spend
intimate time...

324
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,400
maybe on the conjugal visits,
I don't know if you're aware of them.

325
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,000
Every 90 to 100 days
in this facility.

326
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,440
And it goes for three days.

327
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,080
A lot of people think
we're locked in...

328
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,640
like, a closet-sized room
for an hour.

329
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,280
And that's our conjugal visit.

330
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,400
And that's Hollywood for you,
I guess.

331
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,120
It's like a trailer, if you've
ever been in a trailer home.

332
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,160
They're also known as trailer visits,
which sounds kinda trashy.

333
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,200
But I have to bring everything.
I have to bring food, clothing.

334
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,880
It's kind of like we're going
on a trip, I guess, camping.

335
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:24,040
No glass containers, no pepper,
no loosely wrapped items.

336
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,800
Soap, toothpaste, deodorant
cannot have any alcohol.

337
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,440
I guess they think we might get drunk
on soap or... yeah, it was just...

338
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,080
We were just young and in love,
like no care in the world.

339
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,880
We do, like, a date night.

340
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,280
So like, I'll bring a dress,
and he'll bring a shirt and tie.

341
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,640
And this is us
on one of our date nights.

342
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,000
We look beautiful.

343
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,800
And we have a special dinner
and music and dancing and...

344
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,400
I had to get married in here.

345
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,160
You know, this is something that
I believed my wife deserved more.

346
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,040
This is the day we got married,
May 23, 2001.

347
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,600
This is Sean power lifting.

348
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,040
I have better...
I know I have better ones.

349
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,400
Look at this.

350
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,080
I think his heaviest weight
was 600 or 650 pounds.

351
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,680
And... but look how big he is there.

352
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,040
Look at his arms and his neck
and how thick he was.

353
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,720
Bodybuilding in a Speedo.
Oh, my God.

354
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,240
I think he told me he placed third
in the state for the competition.

355
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,800
Sean with his diploma
when he graduated.

356
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,600
That was his graduation
from Hudson Link.

357
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,200
Oh, my God.
He was a baby.

358
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,360
I'll never forget because
it was right before thanksgiving.

359
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,800
So we went out the Monday night
before thanksgiving.

360
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,000
And that was our first date.

361
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,520
We went, we walked, we had dinner.

362
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,600
We had a great conversation,
a really nice time.

363
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,160
At that point, I didn't know anything
about his past.

364
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,440
And he said,
"I have something to tell you."

365
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,000
And it's funny,
because my first thought was...

366
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,800
"Oh, my God, he's married."
Typical New York girl, right?

367
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,360
I don't know anything
about his background.

368
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,320
And somebody says that,
and I thought...

369
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,320
"Oh, I just went on a date
with a guy who's married."

370
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,040
And he said, "No, that's not it."

371
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,280
"But I was in jail.
And I want to tell you what it was."

372
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,120
"Because I really enjoyed today,
and I'd like to ask you out again."

373
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,160
"But you need to know the facts."

374
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,720
When I was 16 years old,
I got into trouble.

375
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
{\an5}I shot and killed
my friend's father...

376
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,560
{\an5}and ended up sentenced
to eight to 24 years in prison.

377
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,200
By the time I came home,
when I was 33 years old...

378
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,800
I had spent more time in prison
than out of prison.

379
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,320
In prison, there are a lot of things
you can be involved with...

380
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,800
but not a lot of things
you can accomplish.

381
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,480
So I would enroll and just go
to school as much as possible...

382
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,000
just always looking to better myself.

383
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,600
It's been the most unbelievable
experience.

384
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,640
The college program that we know
statistically changes lives...

385
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,480
has a great success rate,
is saving the state tons of money...

386
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,040
99 percent of them are coming home
at some point.

387
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,840
Do you want them the same way
they went in or worse?

388
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,000
Or do you want them changed...

389
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,680
and thinking about
what they've done and educated...

390
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,840
and looking to make a difference
in their lives?

391
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,960
I think that that's a nobrainer.

392
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,360
I've seen school
as a second chance...

393
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,040
at doing things right.

394
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,840
{\an5}To see these professors coming in
and going in this hot room...

395
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:54,080
{\an5}with 30-something strangers
to impart knowledge and information.

396
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,600
That would be life changing,
that's you know what?

397
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,400
This is where I'm supposed to be.

398
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,240
This is big for me. It's big.

399
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,080
Because I never thought
I would be doing good in school.

400
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,560
Like, I'm like an A student.

401
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,000
I've got maybe, I think,
one B, two B-pluses.

402
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,320
And the rest are
either As or A-minuses.

403
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,440
So it's an accomplishment.

404
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,920
It feels good to come here at night
and not just be in the yard.

405
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,400
Every time I go
into that cell, I realize...

406
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,720
a number of men have been
in this cell right here.

407
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,640
Some have failed.
Some have been broken.

408
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,440
But I always say,
"I won't count myself among those."

409
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,640
"I won't count myself
in their lot right there."

410
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,040
You can, like,
be part of the gang fights.

411
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,600
{\an5}You can be part of the cuttings,
the stabbings, the drugs...

412
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,640
and whatever else goes on.

413
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,840
You can be part of that.
This is at your disposal.

414
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,680
Or you can turn it into a university.

415
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,480
People that lack education
have to act out.

416
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,280
{\an5}You know, if I can't talk to you,
it's like if I'm talking to a girl.

417
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,720
If I can't talk to her,
I might touch her, you know?

418
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,480
So you know, it gives you the ability
to solve problems.

419
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,240
It gives you the ability to reason.

420
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,760
You become more analytical.
You think about things.

421
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,200
You think further down.

422
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,400
The game changes
from checkers to chess.

423
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,880
People talk about education.
What does education do for you?

424
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,000
And how has it transformed you?

425
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,240
{\an5}I went down to what they call
the Masjid down in the chapel...

426
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,440
{\an5}in the Muslim section.

427
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,520
{\an5}There was a guy down there
who murdered my brother in 1977.

428
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,640
Stanley...

429
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,400
{\an5}So I said to myself, "God, not now.
Not now. No. Why?"

430
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,680
I said,
"If I ever run into this dude...

431
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,880
I'm going to take his head off."

432
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,800
I said, "I'm going to take
his head off, man."

433
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,880
And I said to myself, "No."
Because I said, "I've changed."

434
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,440
I said, "I'm not the same person."

435
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,080
I said, "Man, hey, man. I went
and got all these certificates."

436
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,920
"I did this. I did that.
I'm not the same person."

437
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,920
That's when I went inside myself
for three days...

438
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,840
and I thought things out.

439
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,680
We came down, and he was over there.
There he is.

440
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,160
I looked him right in the eye.

441
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,600
I said, "Man,
why did you murder my brother?"

442
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,280
He said, "Man, I was 15 years old.
It was something that just happened."

443
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,400
I looked at him.
I'm trying to find a way to do so.

444
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,600
Nothing.

445
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,280
I said, "You know what, man?"

446
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,960
I reached out, shook his hand.
And I said, "Man, I forgive you."

447
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,560
And I hugged him.

448
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,160
And I said, "You don't get to worry
about nothing, man."

449
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,040
"There's nobody going to jump you.
Nobody going to stab you."

450
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,080
"Nobody going to do nothing to you.
You got my word on that."

451
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,240
And I walked away.

452
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,960
If I'd have fell into that trap...

453
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,560
if I'd have fall
into that influence...

454
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,280
if I wouldn't have said that I,
"I really want to change."

455
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,720
If it wasn't for the education...

456
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,120
if it wasn't for being around
brothers like these, you know...

457
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,400
I'd have never got out.

458
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,320
And the worst thing about it,
this case would've been overturned...

459
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,720
I still wouldn't have got out,
because I'd have took his head off.

460
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,120
So let's start tonight
with sharing your own poetry.

461
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,640
I asked you to bring in
your favorite poem.

462
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,280
All right, this is a poem I wrote
maybe 10, 12 years ago.

463
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,040
It's called "I am black history."
It goes like this.

464
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,040
"I planted seeds that gave birth
to civilizations."

465
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,720
"I'm the beginning and end."

466
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,440
"I've sat on thrones, recorded
my history through hieroglyphics...

467
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,040
scratched on stones."

468
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,080
"I fathered medicines, science,
philosophy, and astrology...

469
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
built pyramids with hand tools...

470
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,960
established the first universities
and schools."

471
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,360
"For millennia, I've ruled,
even taught my conquerors...

472
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,200
architected more than my share
of the world's wonders."

473
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,640
"I've been brutally slain,
even shackled and chained."

474
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,680
"I've dove into my liquid grave,
off the decks of ships for slaves."

475
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,760
"Millions of my bones lie
on the ocean's floor in rebellion."

476
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,680
"My blood has fertilized
the soils of the Americas."

477
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,000
"I've been lashed, castrated,
and burned to ash...

478
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,760
hung from tight ropes,
died for the right to vote."

479
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,520
"I've cried freedom at rallies."

480
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,240
"I've had a dream,
screamed black power...

481
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,440
bullet or the ballot."

482
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,640
"I've been desegregated
and more separated from my enemy."

483
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,600
"I've fought wars
to protect the system...

484
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,440
that's systematically killing me."

485
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,400
"I've lost my mind, killed and died
at the hands of my own kind."

486
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,840
"I've shot dope
and been a crack fiend...

487
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,440
abused and disrespected
my black queen."

488
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,640
"I've been down and up
the mountaintop...

489
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,120
been falsely accused, been guilty
incarcerated and locked down a lot."

490
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,880
"I've worked my way from the fields
to the boardrooms."

491
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,120
"I've loved and nurtured the growth
of my black woman and child."

492
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,760
"Envision me, the black man."

493
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,760
"And of my history, I am proud.
I am black history."

494
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,960
"I am an eagle in a cage...

495
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,680
unable to spread my wings and fly...

496
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,000
unable to do the things
that make me I."

497
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,480
"I am an eagle in a cage...

498
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,280
able to see the skies...

499
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,040
able to watch the sunset
and sunrise."

500
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,280
"Physically, I am well.
But inside, I cry."

501
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,680
"Inside, I die...

502
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:06,960
tortured, forced to watch
sparrows and butterflies."

503
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,800
"And I die and die."

504
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,160
"No, but this is not my demise."

505
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,160
"In fact, this is when I will rise."

506
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,120
"This is when I will let my spirit
soar high...

507
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,440
past mountains
and see through clouds in the sky."

508
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:29,640
"I remain I, regardless of how long
I am tired, how much I am tried."

509
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,520
"I will not fold. I will not hide.
I will not bide."

510
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,880
"And I damn sure will not die.
I will survive."

511
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,640
"I will be the eagle in the sky."

512
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,240
"No, this is not my demise."

513
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
It's really redemption.

514
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,080
I mean, I've never seen redemption.

515
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,720
I went to Sunday school
and church and all that.

516
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,040
But I've never really saw, felt,
heard, smelled redemption.

517
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,000
This is it.

518
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,080
While in prison,
I began to hate myself.

519
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,000
I began to hate myself
because of the pain...

520
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,120
that I caused the victim's mother.

521
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,080
{\an5}I hated myself because of the grief
and long suffering...

522
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,320
{\an5}that my family endured because
of my ignorance and stupidity.

523
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,880
This hate turned to anger.

524
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,080
I was angry at myself
for not listening to my parents...

525
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,560
when I knew I should.

526
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,360
I was angry because
I brought shame to them...

527
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,480
to my community, and to myself.

528
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,440
I was angry because
I could not go back...

529
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,760
and change the circumstances
of my life.

530
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,680
Thus, these feelings of self-hatred
soon developed...

531
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,120
into a sense of helplessness.

532
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,560
I began to sink into a vast ocean
of despair.

533
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,640
And while I drowned
in this ocean of despair...

534
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:13,320
this ocean of self-hatred,
this ocean of anger, I saw an anchor.

535
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,200
Connected to this anchor was a chain
in the form of links.

536
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,880
It was Hudson Link.

537
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,920
That anchor, Hudson Link,
lifted me up to majestic heights.

538
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
That anchor, Hudson Link, lifted me
up into a lifeboat of education...

539
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,120
and revived me and gave me
a second chance at life.

540
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,760
Hudson Link had mercy on me.

541
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,320
Hudson Link gave me mercy,
Mercy College.

542
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,880
And all of you all supporters
of Hudson Link, Mercy College...

543
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,720
I'm forever grateful.

544
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,800
And I promise to make the best
of this new life.

545
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

546
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Thanks. Well, there's not much that
can top the spirit of those words.

547
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,320
But I think the one thing
that can top it...

548
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,440
is the conferring of degrees.

549
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:21,640
So we will look
to that spirit right now.

550
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,720
So let's begin.

551
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,760
Darrell Bolden.

552
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,960
Todd Mantz.

553
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,480
Denis Martinez.

554
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,320
Christopher Payton.

555
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,960
Joel Jimenez.

556
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,960
By the power of the authority
vested in me...

557
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,320
by the State of New York...

558
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,760
and the Mercy College Board
of Trustees...

559
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,200
I confer upon you
your respective degrees...

560
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,360
with all the rights and privileges
that pertaining.

561
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,640
Now you graduated.
You can take your tassel over.

562
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,120
And congratulations.
We're very proud of you.

563
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,520
I don't think anybody could sit here
and not be overcome.

564
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,840
Because this is very spiritual.

565
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,600
It's sort of like giving birth,
I decided.

566
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,640
If I was trying to tell somebody
about it...

567
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,640
lots of pain,
lots of work, lots of waiting...

568
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,960
lots of striving
and pushing one way or the other.

569
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,200
But you have a new life at the end.

570
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,880
That's the way I see it.

571
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Now it's 9:00, and the graduation
is officially over.

572
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,920
We would like to ask all guests...

573
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,400
to please make their way
towards the exits. Thank you.

574
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,280
May I have your attention?

575
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,360
I need all inmates to report
to their room.

576
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,720
All visitors,
please come up to the front desk...

577
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,600
where the exit is at.

578
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,120
Excuse me.
May I have everyone's attention?

579
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,280
I need all inmates to report
to their room.

580
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,720
Bye. Be good, all right?
I love you. Bye.

581
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,640
I see it as truly redemption.

582
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,520
They're no longer the men
who ended up in prison.

583
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,240
They're new people transformed
by education.
