1
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:27,200
Once, an evil magician
Troll

2
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:35,396
devised a mirror in which
all good and kind vanished

3
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:43,497
while all the foul and disgusting was,
on the contrary, reflected
and seemed even worse than it was

4
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:51,830
Troll's students dragged this
mirror all over the Earth

5
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,017
and caused much evil

6
00:01:56,017 --> 00:02:00,689
and then they desired to
get to the heavens themselves

7
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:06,409
but the mirror fell from their hands

8
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:11,388
crashed and broke into
tiny pieces

9
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:19,701
millions of its splinters scattered
all over the world

10
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:25,321
a person, in whose eye such a
splinter got inside,

11
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:30,511
would start seeing only
defects in everything

12
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:36,151
and his life would
become unbearable

13
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,226
a sad tale

14
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:53,502
TEARS WERE FALLING

15
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,426
Oh, excuse me, Gennady, my
husband came in.  Just a second.

16
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:31,697
Pasha, the table is set and
the soup is on the window sill

17
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,788
Sorry, Genady Akeevich,
I'll start over

18
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:40,840
"Our fate can turn on us at times
So let us say in farewell hour..

19
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,198
...We'll say to Kovalev in chorus
That times without you will be tough."

20
00:08:44,198 --> 00:08:47,580
"That times without you will be tough"
we say that one all together

21
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:53,624
Then I'll print it tomorrow
and hand it out to each department

22
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,378
Of course I'll do it
in time.  Of course

23
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,510
Alright.  I will read on

24
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:09,319
"You've never been too strict with us
Perhaps at times just too much so...

25
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:12,965
...When dedicating these lines to you
We love you so!  We love you so!"

26
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:16,322
"We love you"--chorally again.
In fact, all the last lines are done chorally

27
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:23,035
"May your good life flow on as ever
As ever sparkling with its youth...

28
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:28,745
...We give our love in being hopeful
That you'll forgive us everything."

29
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:35,102
"You are a foe to those who flatter
But we're not scared you'll take offense...

30
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:40,320
...What?  What did you say?
The word "foe"...

31
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:43,349
"Foe" sounds good, but...

32
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:47,524
...Her pregnancy is not visible
to strangers just yet...

33
00:09:47,524 --> 00:09:52,614
but society should not scorn her...

34
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:09,695
I agree with the complexity
that a boy, a twin is growing up...

35
00:10:09,695 --> 00:10:14,394
How can one separate them, knowing
that twins are biologically so intertwined...

36
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:16,599
Daddy-o, whatcha doing?
Not enough chairs in the house?

37
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,382
...whatever has happened in another family...

38
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:26,473
There's a child degenerating in there,
and none of you could care less

39
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:28,140
Not good.

40
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,260
...one can say that the whole
procedure of this surgery...

41
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,261
Sorry, Gennady, what
was that?

42
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:08,932
Dad, maybe I can open
the can of sprats for you?

43
00:11:08,932 --> 00:11:10,297
Will you have some?

44
00:11:28,117 --> 00:11:33,383
Lucy, can you please
stop calling me "dad"

45
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:36,230
--Why is that?
--I'm just asking

46
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:39,131
OK

47
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:43,922
Still, why?  I've called you that
from the very beginning...

48
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:48,243
I don't want to get into it.

49
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,336
Then what should I call
you from now on?

50
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,379
Comrade Vasin, is it?

51
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,930
My name is Pavel Ivanovich

52
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:06,121
Oh, no, that's for close relations.
I, being a stranger here, will
call you Comrade Vasin

53
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:11,092
Officially!  Hello,
Comrade Vasin

54
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:12,727
How was your sleep, Comrade Vasin

55
00:12:12,727 --> 00:12:15,501
--Eat your salad, Comrade Vasin
--Get out of here!

56
00:12:19,008 --> 00:12:21,892
What?

57
00:12:21,892 --> 00:12:25,126
Out!

58
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:39,217
...And here Teterin is now present...

59
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,409
no Gennady, it
must be there!

60
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:45,288
"And here Teterin is now present
He will replace you in your job

61
00:12:45,288 --> 00:12:50,042
...But he'll be the first to feel the loss of
How you are leaving us at last"

62
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,115
"An irreplaceable loss"?

63
00:12:53,115 --> 00:12:54,896
--May I please?
--But that doesn't rhyme

64
00:12:54,896 --> 00:12:57,098
Hello, this is her
husband

65
00:12:57,098 --> 00:12:59,870
I have my own version,
please listen to it

66
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,525
"And now Teterin's been promoted
And everyone feels truly blessed...

67
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:08,377
...And now let's everyone together
Bow down so low and kiss his ass."

68
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:14,265
I think the rhyme is good,
and Comrade Teterin will like it, too.

69
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:17,008
What have you done?
That was Teterin on the phone.

70
00:13:17,008 --> 00:13:18,995
Even better

71
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:31,673
Pavel, what are these silly jokes?
Do you understand how you
made me look?

72
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:34,056
I will dial it again,
you go and apologize

73
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:38,603
Do you hear me, Pasha?
Pasha, what's happened?

74
00:13:38,603 --> 00:13:41,664
Do you have troubles at work?

75
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:46,951
My little hampster,
please answer when asked

76
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:52,599
Oh come on, I ironed this
dress, and now I have to do
it all over again

77
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:55,653
--I find your flattery distasteful
--What flattery?

78
00:13:55,653 --> 00:14:00,372
A person is retiring with a
farewell party.  Some warm words for him...

79
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:03,944
--Who is retiring, Teterin?
--Kovalev is.  Kovalev.

80
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,605
--And Teterin is taking his place
--Precisely

81
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:08,081
What, precisely?! What?!

82
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,942
--Lucy is in tears
--What happened?

83
00:14:10,942 --> 00:14:14,463
--What else has he done?
--I do not tolerate calculating people

84
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:18,730
--Dad, you choose your words
more carefully
--Go, dad has some troubles

85
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,821
Dad, who's calculating?  Lucy? How?

86
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:26,424
That she married a student
without a stipend?  It's laughable

87
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:28,824
--Laugh then!
--Gera, don't pay attention to dad...

88
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:31,081
She wasn't marrying you

89
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:32,934
--Who then?
--Me

90
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:36,277
--This is news
--She thought this student's
dad took bribes

91
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:41,314
--...she'd have a summer house and a car
--pure nonsense!

92
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,229
And who asked me
to set up a new apartment?

93
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:48,810
I asked!  What's wrong with it.
Every woman wants to have
her own home to manage

94
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,787
Do you have your own premises?
Go and manage them, then.

95
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:55,851
--Have you seen those
premises, Comrade Vasin?
--I've seen all kinds of things.

96
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:59,287
--Comrade Vasin, read me a fairy tale
--You have a daddy, he can read to you

97
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:01,872
Gera's busy with his
diploma work

98
00:15:01,872 --> 00:15:05,417
Tell your mommy, if she doesn't
like it here, the door is wide open.

99
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,079
--Excellent!
--I am not keeping anyone

100
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,696
Dad, Lucy is actually no
stranger here. I forbid you to speak
to her in that tone.

101
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:17,329
Young man, you have no
right to prohibit me in anything

102
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:22,938
--You are an absolute zero
--Pavel, stop, it's unbearable!

103
00:15:30,714 --> 00:15:33,734
I'm in everyone's way

104
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:42,950
Pavel, where are you going?

105
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:52,846
Can you explain this?

106
00:15:52,846 --> 00:15:54,546
What, have you lost it?!

107
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:59,670
I tell this overgrown boy for 3 years now
that the tile is falling out, he won't life a finger!

108
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:05,167
Pavel, I feel so sorry for you

109
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:10,252
Pity yourself for how they'll
cripple you!  Poor girl.

110
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:16,498
--Here, take it as a keepsake from grandpa!
--Pasha, calm down!

111
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:19,018
--Egoists
--Pasha, where to?

112
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:39,261
Comrade!  Why do you
look at me that way?

113
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:41,766
--Me?
--Yeah, you

114
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:43,770
I wasn't looking at you

115
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:50,078
No.  You clearly were.

116
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:07,638
Familiarize yourself.
A monthly pass!

117
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:24,796
Hey, pal!  May I join you?

118
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:32,971
She kicked me out

119
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,748
Now she'll start begging me back

120
00:17:39,748 --> 00:17:45,029
"Come in" she'll say.  I'll say
"No" out of principle

121
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:50,013
I have no home, no corner
of my own.  That's how it is, pal

122
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:59,750
--And where's yours?
--Who?

123
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,601
--Fedor!
--And I keep silent

124
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:06,572
--Fedor
--Whaaaaat!

125
00:18:06,572 --> 00:18:08,031
Nothing

126
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:18,293
See that?  I trained her

127
00:18:18,293 --> 00:18:23,701
And you don't just go back either.
Train her good.

128
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:50,082
What do you need?

129
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:55,334
--There are no vacancies.
--There are.

130
00:18:55,334 --> 00:19:00,058
--I need a room.  What must I do?
--Give me your passport

131
00:19:01,453 --> 00:19:07,557
--And put a $10 note in the passport?
--$ No need for the $10
in your passport, citizen.

132
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:14,270
Then is it $15?  Maybe $20?

133
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,381
Will you leave on your own,
or should I call the police?

134
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,507
--Your room key, please
--I'm going to the buffet

135
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:31,720
The buffet is for the
hotel residents only

136
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:42,156
Why do you all sit on your butts?
Get up and open the door for me,
as you're supposed to

137
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:57,206
--Merci!

138
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:08,559
Bobylev, this is Vasin.

139
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,283
--Do you live alone?
--Yes, Pavel Ivanovich

140
00:20:12,283 --> 00:20:18,121
--May I sleep over at your place?
--With whom?

141
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:22,300
Hmm...yeah.
Good lad!

142
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:45,817
"People are lost
only once...

143
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:50,828
"...and having lost their trace,
it cannot be found"

144
00:21:50,828 --> 00:22:00,676
"A person pays a visit to you,
Stays awhile and leaves into the night"

145
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:07,316
"Leaves..."

146
00:22:09,373 --> 00:22:11,449
"Leaves..."

147
00:22:14,228 --> 00:22:24,621
"And if he leaves by day,
he still leaves you

148
00:22:25,202 --> 00:22:35,176
"Let's bring him back this instance
As he is crossing the square"

149
00:22:38,128 --> 00:22:40,742
"Leaves..."

150
00:22:42,718 --> 00:22:45,352
"Leaves..."

151
00:22:50,014 --> 00:23:00,623
"Immediately, bring him back!
We'll chat and lay food on the table"

152
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:11,028
We'll bring him home, we'll settle it,
And throw a fiest in his honor"

153
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:26,495
--I came home
--Very good

154
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:33,690
--Did you get wet?
--None of us are infallible

155
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:41,413
Pasha, they left.  They
flagged down a car and left.

156
00:23:57,095 --> 00:24:00,040
36-63-13

157
00:24:13,106 --> 00:24:13,832
--Yes?

158
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:18,023
--Please call Lyudmila to the phone
--Could you call even later at night?

159
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:20,052
--Do excuse me
--Just a moment

160
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:25,042
--Hello
--Gera?
--Yes

161
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:28,729
--I was calling Lucy
--She's asleep, dad

162
00:24:28,729 --> 00:24:31,932
Please call her

163
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,478
Let them stay overnight there.
Don't drag the child back and forth.
She's traumatized as it is.

164
00:24:42,478 --> 00:24:45,195
Good evening, comrade Vasin.
To what do we owe the honor?

165
00:24:45,195 --> 00:24:50,520
Lucy, you guys come back
home in the morning...

166
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,263
--Yeah?
--Well, that is...

167
00:24:53,263 --> 00:24:57,075
--...if you can review your moral code?
--Really?

168
00:24:57,075 --> 00:25:01,807
Dear Comrade Vasin, we won't come
until YOU review your moral code

169
00:25:01,807 --> 00:25:04,113
--our moral code is doing just fine.
--just fine?!

170
00:25:04,113 --> 00:25:08,765
Did you take my casette player
with you by accident?

171
00:25:08,765 --> 00:25:11,340
--Or did you simply steal it?
--Oh, that's what it's about!

172
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:16,668
Grandpa, you accidentally forgot that
you gifted this junk to your grandaughter
for her birthday

173
00:25:16,668 --> 00:25:19,748
So if you're missing your music,
please buy yourself a new one

174
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:22,694
And do check that all your
forks are still in place!

175
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:39,425
Why do you need that
casette player?

176
00:25:41,646 --> 00:25:43,954
--What for?
--Yeah, what for?

177
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:51,559
--In order to record how you snore
--Who? Me?!

178
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:55,646
Enough.  I endured it for 30
years.  Now, enough.

179
00:25:55,646 --> 00:26:00,029
--I snore?!
--Enough, Ira dear.

180
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:08,394
--If I were you, I wouldn't touch this topic.
--The lowliest dog has a right to mercy.
Tell me why you all hate me.

181
00:26:08,394 --> 00:26:09,997
--For what?
--Who ?

182
00:26:11,885 --> 00:26:14,098
Who hates you?  What
are you talking about?

183
00:26:14,098 --> 00:26:19,667
I've always given you my money
to the last penny.  I never
cheated on you.

184
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:23,407
I devoted my whole
life to you people

185
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,499
--Pavel, what are you...?
--Don't!

186
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:28,330
Just don't say that
I am old and bald

187
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,994
--When did I ever say that?
--...that you are ashamed to
be seen with me.  I am only human.

188
00:26:32,733 --> 00:26:35,006
I have nerves like
everyone else

189
00:26:35,006 --> 00:26:40,702
--Pasha, the thought has nevereven crossed my mind...
--Excuse me, I must wake up early tomorrow

190
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:44,316
Good night

191
00:27:10,153 --> 00:27:15,633
Pasha, you and I
never used to fight

192
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:20,786
Just tell me,
what has happened?

193
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:26,728
Have you fallen ill,
my little hampster?

194
00:27:31,017 --> 00:27:36,956
--What's with you?
--What for?

195
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,529
--What, my little one?
--What do you paint your
lips for in your old age?

196
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:47,534
Whom are you
trying to tempt?

197
00:27:48,415 --> 00:27:51,050
Swamp-Queen!

198
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:56,101
Alright, you chased out the kids
Now chasing me out too

199
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:58,837
Good boy!

200
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:42,235
Ira

201
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:13,030
I am at Dina's

202
00:30:14,065 --> 00:30:16,487
Dina, good morning, this is Vasin

203
00:30:16,487 --> 00:30:19,591
Lightened up a bit?
Pavlik, listen to me carefully

204
00:30:19,591 --> 00:30:24,300
First, you need to seek treatment.
Take a vacation, drink some herbs, and so on

205
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,261
Second, Irina doesn't see that
you're having a nervous breakdown
And you must keep that in mind

206
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:32,023
--Third...
--Dina, tell her that I regret
last night

207
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:34,730
There you go!  Only you
will say it to her yourself

208
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:45,967
I'm listening.  Go ahead, Pavel

209
00:30:47,791 --> 00:30:51,727
--Desert
--What?

210
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:59,159
--Nothing
--Pasha, do you recall
the first word little Masha said?

211
00:31:02,186 --> 00:31:04,284
Remember?

212
00:31:04,284 --> 00:31:07,316
"Give"

213
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:11,701
No, hampster, her first word
was "grandpa"

214
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:18,616
"Gradpapa."  And that's when you spent
your paycheck on the casette player
and said we would record her

215
00:31:18,616 --> 00:31:22,045
Remember now?
Pavel, you hear me?

216
00:31:22,045 --> 00:31:25,274
No, I am not listening
to you.  So long.

217
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:44,200
Hi, Pavel Ivanovich!
Again you made a draft.

218
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:48,954
You have a cold.
Acting like a child.

219
00:32:05,594 --> 00:32:11,146
--I'm listening
--Tell me, people are saying you're planning
to take all dogs outside city limits

220
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:13,970
--Does that apply to medal-winning dogs?
--What dogs, what for?

221
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,808
For them to do
their doggy business...

222
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:19,635
--Citizen, lady where are you calling?
--I'm calling you, "vice-"

223
00:32:19,635 --> 00:32:22,071
My dog has 2 medals and one diploma

224
00:32:23,156 --> 00:32:26,989
Listen, there's a special organization
for dogs.  Let them take them out.

225
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:33,127
--Zenaida Petrovna, did Vasin come in yet?
--Not yet, Valentin Maksimovich

226
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:36,147
When he gets in,
send him to me right away

227
00:32:36,147 --> 00:32:39,925
--Valentin Maksimovich, please pick up
--Say that I'm at the pharmacy

228
00:32:39,925 --> 00:32:43,350
It's Mamaev

229
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:47,863
--Hello, Igor Igorevich
--Sorokin, what's with
your garages

230
00:32:48,126 --> 00:32:50,806
People go to work, and
meanwhile their garages
get knocked down

231
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:55,561
--Everyone had been warned
--When?!  A year ago?!

232
00:32:55,596 --> 00:32:57,122
Should have demolished
them then

233
00:32:57,122 --> 00:33:01,455
--It was Vasin's idea...
--And now it was more appropriate
to give the owners some time

234
00:33:01,455 --> 00:33:05,361
Understood, Igor Igor'evich

235
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:09,499
--Zinaida Petrovna
--Yes

236
00:33:09,499 --> 00:33:14,126
--Immediately halt the
demolition of garages
--Is that an order?

237
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:15,888
Consider it an order

238
00:33:15,888 --> 00:33:21,144
Pavel Ivanovich had asked
that such an order must be in writing

239
00:33:21,144 --> 00:33:26,046
What for?  Starting a paper trail?
There's a paper shortage in our
country as it is.

240
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:31,750
To have an official document
for why those wrecks
are still standing

241
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,323
Alright, I'll get you
a written document

242
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:37,717
--Hello
--One minute

243
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:39,715
--Hello
--Is this the communal department?

244
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:42,326
--Yes
--I'm calling about the garage

245
00:33:42,326 --> 00:33:46,639
Comrades, your children will
play on green grass in that spot

246
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:49,684
--One minute please
--This garage hardly bothers anyone

247
00:33:49,684 --> 00:33:52,684
I'm not authorized to change
the management's decision

248
00:33:53,017 --> 00:33:54,513
So sorry

249
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:06,848
What's this I hear about our Vasin
going rabid mad?

250
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:08,767
I told you he was
kicked out of the house

251
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:13,779
Last night called me all enraged,
asking who I lived with, and could
he spend the night over

252
00:34:13,779 --> 00:34:17,539
Please stop your gossip,
nobody wants to know that

253
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:19,771
Don't shout at me

254
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:23,377
I told you that this is all
under Sorokin's authority

255
00:34:23,377 --> 00:34:25,345
Yes.  Hello?

256
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:31,509
Pavel Ivanovich, is it true what they say
that now all dogs will be walked behind the far lake?

257
00:34:31,872 --> 00:34:35,086
--They will
--How will they get there?

258
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:38,961
--Individually, or on an express bus?
--They'll get their on their own

259
00:34:40,574 --> 00:34:44,970
--Go straight here
--I'll take Lomonosov str.  It's quicker

260
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:48,434
--Keep going
--Come now, Pavel Ivanovich,
don't I know this city?

261
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:54,149
Spending government money
driving around in zig-zags

262
00:34:54,149 --> 00:34:56,865
So you caught me now?

263
00:34:56,865 --> 00:35:00,252
Yes, we caught you

264
00:35:08,196 --> 00:35:13,237
--Wait here.
--It was supposed to be 20 minutes
and it's been almost 2 hours now

265
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,729
You may go. I no
longer need you.

266
00:35:19,395 --> 00:35:23,080
--Aren't you ashamed?  No?
--Pavel Ivanovich...!

267
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,005
I called but couldn't reach you,
try to understand me

268
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:28,095
Knock it down!

269
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:52,087
--Young people why are you
stealing the materials?
--No, the guard let us take it

270
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,317
--Hello
--Howdy

271
00:36:07,317 --> 00:36:12,077
OK, guys, stand up, get
closer, let's take the photo

272
00:36:12,077 --> 00:36:13,920
--Hello
--Hello, Comrade Vasin

273
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,049
Sasha, look who's here

274
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:20,315
Comrade, please move
over to the left

275
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:22,075
Cut in a little more

276
00:36:22,075 --> 00:36:24,717
--Ready?
--One second.  Sasha!

277
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:27,586
Comrades, I want to know
what is happening here?

278
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:28,957
A wedding

279
00:36:28,957 --> 00:36:33,762
In that case, I wish to
congratulate the young couple

280
00:36:33,762 --> 00:36:36,681
--that's first of all.  And second...
--The young couple is us

281
00:36:36,681 --> 00:36:42,688
Then I congratulate you, but
I request that you clear the premises.

282
00:36:42,688 --> 00:36:44,493
But we had permission

283
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:49,451
Nobody could permit to have a
drinking binge in an unfinished building.
You are all adults here, you should...

284
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:52,686
I knew this would happen.
Shouldn't have lied to people!

285
00:36:52,686 --> 00:36:56,960
Attention, I am
taking it now!

286
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,561
Smile!

287
00:36:58,561 --> 00:37:01,631
Only hurry up.

288
00:37:16,803 --> 00:37:19,469
Pavel, I came for you

289
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:25,738
--Hello, Pavel
--Hello, Dina

290
00:37:25,738 --> 00:37:28,310
--Hello, Pavel
--Hello, Dina

291
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:33,496
Pavel, there's a therapist, Sklyansky,
a brilliant professor

292
00:37:33,496 --> 00:37:38,405
People wait for 2 years to see him,
but he agreed to see you now

293
00:37:38,405 --> 00:37:40,758
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

294
00:37:41,971 --> 00:37:48,234
Pavel, I know all your principles,
but could you get him into a co-op garage?

295
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:50,895
He's a worthy person, and
it's nothing so bad really...

296
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:52,373
--With pleasure
--Really?

297
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:55,116
Yes.  This instance.

298
00:37:55,116 --> 00:37:58,090
With great pleasure.

299
00:37:59,087 --> 00:38:03,156
Pavel...well... get in, let's go

300
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:05,594
--I cannot
--Why not?

301
00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:09,879
Dina, I already cured myself

302
00:38:13,786 --> 00:38:17,168
I used cowberry leaf!

303
00:38:19,749 --> 00:38:24,374
Galkina, write this down: fire the
guard from construction site 3
for negligence

304
00:38:24,374 --> 00:38:27,426
--Where should I write it down?
--You'll find where

305
00:38:27,426 --> 00:38:29,456
Sorokin's been looking for you

306
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:31,691
--Pavel Ivanovich, may I take an hour off?
--You may not

307
00:38:31,691 --> 00:38:34,863
I wish to knock down
my garage with my own hands

308
00:38:34,863 --> 00:38:38,295
--ask Sorokin
--we know better than that

309
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:40,582
What is this?

310
00:38:40,582 --> 00:38:43,697
--A sauna
--Precisely.  A fire hazard.

311
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,966
--And these are?
--Tennis courts

312
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:48,609
--How many of you work in that factory?
--11...
--Thousand?

313
00:38:49,514 --> 00:38:53,283
--Speaking
--Pavel, I'm calling
regarding the garages

314
00:38:53,283 --> 00:38:58,229
I just want to know whose
order it was, Vladimir Nikolaevich's?

315
00:38:58,497 --> 00:39:01,010
Mine.
So that 2 people can
swing their raquets.

316
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:06,429
But it was your idea to delay
the demolishion of these garages

317
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:09,395
Timing creates the
necessary adjustments

318
00:39:09,395 --> 00:39:11,894
Could you please sign this.
It's my reprimand for
professional misconduct

319
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:13,988
--Did you call Mamaev?
No

320
00:39:14,023 --> 00:39:18,148
--When he calls, will you let me know?
--Where?  In the clinic?

321
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:22,015
--Go make copies of this
--Cut it out.  You created this mess,
and you fix it

322
00:39:22,877 --> 00:39:27,556
--I said it's a severe reprimand
--I was hoping it might be a basic one

323
00:39:29,127 --> 00:39:34,745
--Young lady, you forgot to tear off the label
--I cannot, I haven't bought the pants yet

324
00:39:34,745 --> 00:39:38,723
--Pavel Ivanovich, what do you think...
--Call Galkina here immediately!

325
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:43,214
--Will you sign it or stare at her pants?
--I will not sign

326
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,649
I already told you that
I will not sign

327
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:51,020
--But why, Pavel? We had an agreement...
--That doggy playground!

328
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,241
--The district will put it on this spot
--What playground?

329
00:39:55,241 --> 00:40:01,198
--What do you have in mind?
--A place to walk the dogs.
Cuz they've crapped all over town

330
00:40:01,198 --> 00:40:05,826
And some people are
following the dogs' example

331
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,664
--Is this some kind of a joke?
--This is no place for jokes

332
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:12,207
--Pavel Ivanovich, did you call me?
--Comrades, that's all I have.

333
00:40:12,207 --> 00:40:18,777
--Alright, we'll talk elsewhere
--We'll tell Efimov about your ideas.
He'll give you dogs to remember!

334
00:40:18,777 --> 00:40:22,579
--Don't intimidate us.  Efimov
is also quite manageable
--We'll see about that

335
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:27,777
No, comrade general, no
exceptions for any Gaeva, sorry!

336
00:40:27,777 --> 00:40:30,807
Gaeva has a permanent garage
that is not subject to demolishion

337
00:40:30,842 --> 00:40:34,781
--Galkina, write this down:
Solov'ev gets no bonus
--For what?

338
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:40,257
--For wasting time dressing up at work
--Please don't.  She's a dedicated worker

339
00:40:40,257 --> 00:40:42,317
She works saturdays and sundays

340
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:44,703
--May I?
--See Sorokin about garages

341
00:40:44,703 --> 00:40:48,592
--No, she's here to get
a piece of my apartment

342
00:40:48,592 --> 00:40:49,858
--Yep
--Did I guess it right?

343
00:40:49,858 --> 00:40:51,809
You're mistaken,
Comrade Vasin

344
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:56,307
I am returning all the
stuff we stole from you

345
00:41:00,113 --> 00:41:03,059
There!

346
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:08,263
There!

347
00:41:08,263 --> 00:41:11,094
And there!  I lost
the other one.

348
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,424
I'll reimburse you
at first opportunity

349
00:41:14,581 --> 00:41:17,082
--Check it, it works
--Lucy

350
00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:25,199
Yeah, I'm a fool and a simple nurse
and no match for your son.
But we'll manage to live without your charity

351
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:27,291
Lucy, wait!

352
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:32,186
I'm just saying, if you are standing
on principle, then you should return everything

353
00:41:32,186 --> 00:41:37,296
The bag?  We bought it with our
own money.  The bag is ours!

354
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:49,280
"It is a good omen,
ice is melting in the heart..."

355
00:41:53,185 --> 00:41:58,234
--Vasin speaking
--Comrade Vasin, this is Kuziatin. There's a
person threatening me with a rifle here

356
00:41:58,234 --> 00:42:00,794
--Where?
--Here, building # 7

357
00:42:00,794 --> 00:42:03,821
I'll be right there

358
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:10,373
These are my mother's earrings.
My most precious possession.

359
00:42:10,373 --> 00:42:14,937
She lost the second one on purpose,
so as to hit where it hurts most

360
00:42:14,937 --> 00:42:20,050
Don't worry, Pavel Ivanovich,
everything will get resolved

361
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,600
--You're gathering evidence on me?
--What evidence?

362
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:30,494
Don't.  Don't, Galkina. I can
see right through all of you

363
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:34,869
--Raya
--Yes, Pavel Ivanovich

364
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:39,054
--May I get Kostya for 15 minutes?
--No, his carburator is not working
--Got it

365
00:42:40,915 --> 00:42:43,197
Zinaida, why are you
wasting time in here?

366
00:42:43,197 --> 00:42:45,638
Go, start digging!

367
00:42:45,638 --> 00:42:50,207
--Dig where, Pavel Ivanovich?
--Dig dirt on me.  Maybe you'll find some.

368
00:43:32,349 --> 00:43:34,758
So here we are

369
00:43:34,758 --> 00:43:41,570
Nikolai Vanechkin is out with a
rifle to protect his property

370
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:47,894
What a pretty picture!
Have a look at him.  Have a look!

371
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:51,816
Not property, dear Pavel,
but justice

372
00:43:51,816 --> 00:43:59,377
Fedor is a war veteran-invalid,
has a Medal of Glory, and he is entitled.

373
00:44:02,991 --> 00:44:06,323
--Medal of Glory, you say?
--Yep

374
00:44:06,323 --> 00:44:10,246
--Did you know that this medalist
of yours stole my soap?
--How come?

375
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:15,399
In 1943, took a whole
brand new piece of it

376
00:44:15,399 --> 00:44:17,265
Happens a lot

377
00:44:17,265 --> 00:44:22,731
But the main thing here is that
Nikolai Vanechkin, my best friend's father
is out in the street...!

378
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:25,261
Beat it, or there's no
telling what I might do

379
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:28,601
Pavel Ivanovich, leave or
he'll kill you for sure

380
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:30,267
Hands up!

381
00:44:31,028 --> 00:44:32,695
Get down!

382
00:44:32,695 --> 00:44:36,918
Shoot me.  Go ahead.

383
00:44:36,918 --> 00:44:42,168
Shoot, uncle Nikolai.
Maybe I'll even thank you.

384
00:44:45,877 --> 00:44:47,911
It's not loaded

385
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:51,047
A piece of soap

386
00:44:52,516 --> 00:44:55,510
Comrade Vanechkin
take your weapon

387
00:44:56,712 --> 00:45:00,477
Take a hike, scumbag!

388
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:07,045
Kuziakin, where are you?

389
00:45:07,045 --> 00:45:09,809
--Did he leave?
--He did

390
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:14,608
--I'm here
--Turn the weapon over to the police
Take a bulldozer and demolish everything.

391
00:45:14,608 --> 00:45:17,676
--Everything!
--What bulldozer do you mean?

392
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:22,188
--It's been called off
--Who called off?

393
00:45:22,188 --> 00:45:27,143
--Sorokin called me.
--Why didn't you say anything, moron?

394
00:45:27,143 --> 00:45:32,832
But our main thing was to
liquidate this military cell
in a touristy spot

395
00:45:32,832 --> 00:45:38,253
--So you haven't knocked down a single garage?
--Sure did.  Gaeva's.

396
00:45:38,253 --> 00:45:43,423
--Did it early in the morning
--Gaeva's was permanent and
not subject to demolition

397
00:45:43,423 --> 00:45:49,838
You're mistaken, Pavel Ivanovich.
It was subject to it

398
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:53,507
I started off with hers.

399
00:46:08,132 --> 00:46:09,161
You need to see me?

400
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:21,436
--He's not in, Pavel Ivanovich
--I know, I know, he's at the clinic

401
00:46:27,026 --> 00:46:28,881
When he shows up,
connect us

402
00:46:32,811 --> 00:46:37,273
Why are you following me?
I thought I explained it all
in detail

403
00:46:37,273 --> 00:46:39,384
What else?

404
00:46:46,266 --> 00:46:50,213
Natalya, where's Galkina.
Don't you hear me?

405
00:46:50,213 --> 00:46:54,517
--I'm talking to you
--I'm on my break

406
00:46:54,517 --> 00:46:58,455
--Everyone has a right to take a rest
--We know all about that right

407
00:46:58,455 --> 00:47:02,904
--Run out and find her
--Let those with bonus pay
run around

408
00:47:02,904 --> 00:47:05,718
--In that case, you're fired
--Oh, I'm so scared

409
00:47:11,256 --> 00:47:15,147
Comrade, are you Vasin?

410
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,424
Vasin speaking.  Hello.  Hello?

411
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:29,146
Comrade, so then you are Vasin?

412
00:47:33,203 --> 00:47:34,961
I am Vasin

413
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:45,150
--Hello
--Semenov?
--Yeah

414
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:47,727
--Is your bulldozer gone?
--It's leaving
--Hold it back

415
00:47:47,727 --> 00:47:51,464
Hold it there at any price.
It's not over.  The night is young.

416
00:47:51,464 --> 00:47:54,173
I am from the local newspaper

417
00:47:54,173 --> 00:47:57,221
--From where?
--the newspaper

418
00:47:57,221 --> 00:48:02,561
We're preparing a feature about
how living arrangements affect
family relationships

419
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:06,426
--I think you could help us
out with this question
--I'm on my break

420
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,278
Till 2pm
Hello?

421
00:48:08,278 --> 00:48:11,945
--5 minutes
--Be so kind as to
wait outside

422
00:48:11,945 --> 00:48:14,144
--Darvatov?
--Speaking, Pavel Ivanovich

423
00:48:14,144 --> 00:48:17,889
Listen, don't halt the
demolition.  Understood?
Do not halt it!

424
00:48:17,889 --> 00:48:20,796
I cannot, Pavel Ivanovich.
Let Sorokin call me himself.

425
00:48:20,796 --> 00:48:24,238
--Your Sorokin will call you
--When?
--I said he'll call you

426
00:48:26,008 --> 00:48:29,607
--Raya, did Sorokin show up?
--No, Pavel Ivanovich

427
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:36,249
--Have a nice stay
--The law lets you work
here 2 more weeks

428
00:48:36,249 --> 00:48:38,732
Nope.  Find yourself
some other fool.

429
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:08,873
"Drops are falling on the rooftops
Pouring rain is falling..."

430
00:49:08,873 --> 00:49:17,428
"...as if somewhere a distant drummer
beats his little drum."

431
00:49:17,428 --> 00:49:21,042
--Now you go ahead
--Me?
--Yeah

432
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:27,613
"Drops are falling on the rooftops
Pouring rain is falling..."

433
00:49:27,613 --> 00:49:28,553
Good job, Masha dear

434
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:36,121
"...as if somewhere beats his little drum
a distant drummer."

435
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:38,634
Other way around. Drummer first.
But it sounds good anyway.

436
00:49:38,634 --> 00:49:41,307
Now let's sing together

437
00:49:41,307 --> 00:49:44,250
Grandma, leave
cuz we're shy

438
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:50,498
--1,2,3... Daddy, close the door
--What, did you buy the whole store?

439
00:49:51,776 --> 00:49:54,198
Yeah

440
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:59,786
I got nothing today.
Go to the cafeteria

441
00:50:01,316 --> 00:50:05,446
Today I have. See?
Ellie baked them

442
00:50:05,446 --> 00:50:09,592
Pastries with jam
Blintzes with cabbage

443
00:50:10,931 --> 00:50:16,263
So, Pavel Ivanovich,
shall we take a ride?

444
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:21,172
I dug up some worms.
Made kasha for the road.

445
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:27,570
Stanislav, let's take
you as an example

446
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:34,998
While you bring this
woman along with you

447
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:38,698
So, am I to keep silent
about that?

448
00:50:41,958 --> 00:50:49,543
Of all people, you should know better
that she is practically my wife

449
00:50:49,543 --> 00:50:54,101
--So let's not touch this topic
--No, let's!

450
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:58,158
Since you started this
conversation, then let's!

451
00:50:58,158 --> 00:51:02,691
It's not clear to Masha "practically"
whose wife she is, yours or
that soccer players.

452
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:04,790
Vasin speaking.  Hello

453
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,957
--Press the button!  Hello!
--What soccer player?

454
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,620
I don't know. There's lots of them.
Raya, did Sorokin show up?

455
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,764
No, Pavel Ivanovich

456
00:51:17,426 --> 00:51:22,251
How do you know about a soccer player?
Is it rumors, or are there facts?

457
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:25,346
Ask your second real wife,
she's telling everyone

458
00:51:25,346 --> 00:51:27,398
--May I speak to Kuziakin please
--Nonsense!

459
00:51:27,398 --> 00:51:29,720
She knows nothing at all

460
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:35,299
...about Ellie's existence.  She
never even heard of her name.

461
00:51:35,699 --> 00:51:38,328
Dammit.  Nobody's
working today.

462
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:43,528
--Doesn't know?  --Nope
--Never heard?  --Nope

463
00:51:46,218 --> 00:51:49,024
Sofia, good afternoon.
Vasin is troubling you.

464
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:50,945
--Cut that out
--Hang on

465
00:51:50,945 --> 00:51:55,547
Sofia, do you know about the love
affair between your husband and
your neighbor Elvira?

466
00:51:55,547 --> 00:51:57,895
Who doesn't know
about it?

467
00:51:57,895 --> 00:52:00,669
--Then tell him that
--Hey!
--He's in my office.

468
00:52:00,669 --> 00:52:01,827
--[Reporter] Now can we talk?!

469
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:07,315
--I of course understand that you're kidding...
--I'M ON BREAK!
--But this is a bad, cruel joke, and doesn't become you.

470
00:52:07,315 --> 00:52:10,903
--It's 2 PM!
--1:57

471
00:52:10,903 --> 00:52:15,849
Sofia, try to see that you're
creating an odd situation
for everyone

472
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:21,144
Why do I have to raise my
grand-daughter in a lie?

473
00:52:21,144 --> 00:52:23,242
She hung up

474
00:52:24,268 --> 00:52:26,592
Now you know that
she knows.  So what?

475
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:29,119
--Vasin speaking
--Hello!

476
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,122
--Hello, do you hear me...?
--She knows.  And so what?

477
00:52:32,122 --> 00:52:35,861
--I hear you
--The phone here is not working

478
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:41,580
--Comrade...sorry, don't know your name...
--Pavel Ivanovich

479
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:45,447
--Turn off the pot
--Sasha Ermakov is
renting a room from me

480
00:52:45,482 --> 00:52:48,996
--Bon Appetite!
--...the one whose wedding
you visited

481
00:52:48,996 --> 00:52:52,882
--Hello?  Hello?
--I am listening

482
00:52:52,882 --> 00:52:57,078
When you left, there
was a break-up

483
00:52:57,078 --> 00:52:59,635
--They quarreled badly
--How can I help?

484
00:52:59,635 --> 00:53:04,063
You must let them hold
their wedding there

485
00:53:05,293 --> 00:53:10,978
moreover, your colleage had given
them permission...forget her name

486
00:53:10,978 --> 00:53:13,410
That's a lie

487
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:18,876
Comrade, understand, this is
a question of a person's life.

488
00:53:18,876 --> 00:53:21,964
I'm speaking to you, but I
had to hide the rope from him

489
00:53:21,964 --> 00:53:24,595
--He's in such a state that...
--Where do you live?

490
00:53:24,595 --> 00:53:26,765
Anyusin Lane, #5

491
00:53:26,765 --> 00:53:29,442
Citizen, that's not in
our district

492
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:31,219
Sorry.

493
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:36,216
On Wednesday, I came straight to you
in the presence of Manohin and Kakaev

494
00:53:36,216 --> 00:53:39,256
--What for?
--And I said...

495
00:53:39,256 --> 00:53:42,556
...that Ermakov, the tram depot
carpenter,

496
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:48,388
...is requesting to hold a wedding
in the one-room apartment
that was allocated to him

497
00:53:48,388 --> 00:53:51,682
--Why?
--Because he had already
sent out the invitations

498
00:53:51,682 --> 00:53:56,502
--You told me to
let him go ahead
--So...

499
00:53:56,502 --> 00:54:00,354
I said that this doesn't fall
under our authority

500
00:54:00,354 --> 00:54:06,365
You said that it's not the
guy's fault that the fire inspector
hasn't approved the building for move-in

501
00:54:06,365 --> 00:54:09,761
--So...
--And that I was being
a bookish bureaucrat

502
00:54:09,761 --> 00:54:12,571
You wanna hang a
suicide on me

503
00:54:17,257 --> 00:54:21,976
Let me ask Tolya to
drive you home

504
00:54:21,976 --> 00:54:26,179
--you have a cold, and the city is...
--Galkina, this is so primitive!

505
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,281
Take me home and
put you in my place?

506
00:54:29,217 --> 00:54:34,345
Only you sign me off too soon.
The night is young.  I'll knock down
those guarages and stop that wedding!

507
00:54:34,345 --> 00:54:38,042
And your extortionist won't
get the apartment either

508
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:41,601
--He will get it
--He won't. I'll speak out against.

509
00:54:45,371 --> 00:54:47,538
I will speak for it,
and everyone will support me.

510
00:54:47,538 --> 00:54:51,850
Then there will be no room
for both of us under this roof

511
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:54,400
In that case, it will be
me who will stay

512
00:54:56,085 --> 00:55:01,056
At last!  I tore off
your mask.

513
00:55:01,056 --> 00:55:03,991
Pavel Ivanovich,
Sorokin just came

514
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:04,925
Coming!

515
00:55:04,925 --> 00:55:08,384
Galkina, I thougt you were my friend.
I even wanted to marry you.

516
00:55:08,384 --> 00:55:11,677
--When?
--This morning.

517
00:55:11,677 --> 00:55:16,343
--What about your wife and kids?
--That does not concern you.

518
00:55:16,343 --> 00:55:19,969
I never cheated on my wife,
and I never intend to!

519
00:55:28,122 --> 00:55:32,803
Holding on to your power chair?!
Trying to please everyone?!
You double-checker!

520
00:55:32,803 --> 00:55:37,375
Raya, instantly connect Sorokin
with the 5th SMU, and say they
must return the machines NOW!

521
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,826
Watch how you poke those fingers.
This is still my office!

522
00:55:39,826 --> 00:55:42,456
--FOR NOW!
--And no need to yell at me

523
00:55:42,456 --> 00:55:45,422
I can also shout so the
windows will shatter

524
00:55:45,422 --> 00:55:48,688
--You're with them, dammit!
--Why are you intimidating me?

525
00:55:48,688 --> 00:55:51,888
Why do you all try to intimidate me?
Look at you, commandeering around here

526
00:55:51,888 --> 00:55:56,356
His wife busted him, so
we all have to tip-toe around
your hysterical persona

527
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:59,713
--That's personal!
--Do excuse me...

528
00:55:59,713 --> 00:56:06,069
My mother-in-law tore out a lump
of hair from my head on Wednesday?
You know about that?  Does anyone?  NO!

529
00:56:06,069 --> 00:56:10,013
Did it show in my work?  No!
Because I keep myself in check

530
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:18,641
--I don't mix personal with professional
--Valentin Maximovich, 7th SMU is on the line

531
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:21,251
Raya, I am not here.

532
00:56:22,885 --> 00:56:26,279
Here, have some.  From Finland.
You can bring me some in the evening.

533
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:28,825
Why are you staring?  Take.
I know where to get more.

534
00:56:28,825 --> 00:56:36,047
And one more thing.  Use words.
They mostly care about words
"Little chicken, little birdie..."

535
00:56:37,339 --> 00:56:39,692
Raya dear, 2 teas please

536
00:56:39,692 --> 00:56:44,937
--Buying me off?
--Please, like I'd bother with that

537
00:56:46,677 --> 00:56:49,208
Pavel Ivanovich!

538
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:52,186
It was Vladimir Nikolaevich's order

539
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:57,008
I just came from
his office. Wish I never did.

540
00:56:57,008 --> 00:56:59,130
Know what he said to me?

541
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:04,395
--That it doesn't fit the place
--Fine.  Let's see if he's in the right place!

542
00:57:04,395 --> 00:57:07,303
Don't get into it!

543
00:57:07,303 --> 00:57:11,799
--Raya, please connect me with
the birdie
--Sorry, with whom?

544
00:57:11,799 --> 00:57:15,431
Forgive me, my head is all confused.
With my wife.

545
00:57:16,152 --> 00:57:18,488
--Bobylev!
--Pavel Ivanovich, it's my
lunch hour now...

546
00:57:18,488 --> 00:57:22,041
--Drive me to the city council
--Of course.  With pleasure.

547
00:57:22,041 --> 00:57:25,817
I thought I'd run out and
find a bumper during lunch

548
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,629
It's in my garage.  I came there,
but I forgot my key

549
00:57:28,629 --> 00:57:31,121
--It was in my coat
--Hey there, Pavel!

550
00:57:31,121 --> 00:57:34,248
--I need to see you
--Hi.  Bad timing, come by later

551
00:57:34,248 --> 00:57:37,523
Listen, what did you say
to my dad?  That I stole some
bar of soap from you...?

552
00:57:37,523 --> 00:57:40,854
Forgot?  I'll remind you.
May 1943, Boys Village
in Amur Region

553
00:57:40,854 --> 00:57:44,391
My soap vanished in the morning.
In the evening you brought
a bottle of booze.

554
00:57:44,391 --> 00:57:47,634
--What "Boys"?
--Where we were demoted together

555
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:49,474
That girl Manja gave it to me.
Remember, the one with the braid?

556
00:57:49,474 --> 00:57:52,008
--Why did she give you the booze?
--What? For soap?
--What else?!

557
00:57:52,008 --> 00:57:54,131
And you kept it
for 40 years?

558
00:57:54,131 --> 00:57:57,751
Bobylev, have some tact.
No, just remembered it this morning.

559
00:57:57,751 --> 00:58:01,027
Saw your daddy-o and remembered.
Like father like son.

560
00:58:01,027 --> 00:58:03,103
Degenerates

561
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:05,973
Wait, little hampster

562
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:12,627
Here you go.
Go buy yourself some soap.

563
00:58:14,363 --> 00:58:16,407
Wash the dirt off.

564
00:58:22,322 --> 00:58:27,342
Bobylev.  See that?
Childhood friend.  Let's go.

565
00:58:30,932 --> 00:58:33,233
And this one... get acquainted...

566
00:58:33,233 --> 00:58:37,181
--Pavel, I was just...
--This is Dina, a friend of the family

567
00:58:38,796 --> 00:58:40,873
--Hello
--Come this way please
--Pavlik!

568
00:58:40,873 --> 00:58:44,460
This is Elena Kirilovna.
You probably don't know her.

569
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:47,281
Stay in there, snowqueen.
Take rest, snake.

570
00:58:47,281 --> 00:58:51,133
These 2 dames try to get rid of me
by sending me to shrinks

571
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:53,488
--Looky here!
--Pavel, what shrinks

572
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:57,085
This turkey, professor Sklyansky...

573
00:58:57,085 --> 00:59:01,491
...him you know.  He lectures
alcoholics on television.

574
00:59:01,491 --> 00:59:04,589
--Let's go.
--An totally normal jerk!

575
00:59:04,589 --> 00:59:06,771
Pavel!

576
00:59:08,192 --> 00:59:10,760
--Oh Lord!
--Bye

577
00:59:11,902 --> 00:59:13,614
Poor man!

578
00:59:25,582 --> 00:59:28,061
Heart problems,
Pavel Ivanovich?

579
00:59:28,061 --> 00:59:31,893
--Do you have a pen?
--Left it at work

580
00:59:32,908 --> 00:59:36,309
And garage keys, too.
Can we stop over and get those keys?

581
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:39,045
--My new bumper is there...
Bobylev...

582
00:59:39,045 --> 00:59:42,733
If we open up your brain,
what will we find there?

583
00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:46,674
--Brains.
--A bumper!

584
00:59:50,024 --> 00:59:54,705
--One ball-point pen, please
--Can you read, sir?

585
00:59:54,705 --> 00:59:57,926
It says we're on break
from 14:00 to 15:00

586
00:59:58,794 --> 01:00:00,215
It's 15:00 now

587
01:00:00,215 --> 01:00:04,266
Can you hear the music?
When it's over,
that's when it's 15:00

588
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:11,282
Lady, there's 3.5 billion of us
on this tiny planet

589
01:00:11,282 --> 01:00:12,929
We can reach out and touch
each other with our hand.

590
01:00:12,929 --> 01:00:15,827
But we live as if the
entire universe separates us!

591
01:00:15,827 --> 01:00:19,478
I am speaking to you from Venus
and you cannot hear me on Mars

592
01:00:19,478 --> 01:00:22,380
And I shout over to you,
lady, darling, sweetheart...

593
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:27,633
please sell me that ball-point
pen for 37 cents!

594
01:00:27,633 --> 01:00:31,887
I really need it.  My
life depends on it.

595
01:00:31,887 --> 01:00:36,079
And what?  How can one
live this way?  What for?

596
01:00:41,427 --> 01:00:43,207
Get in line, sir.

597
01:00:44,014 --> 01:00:45,778
--What do you want, boy?
--An eraser.

598
01:00:45,778 --> 01:00:47,655
5 cents

599
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,057
--You?
--The complaint book

600
01:00:58,277 --> 01:01:00,051
And a pen.

601
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:03,376
You may be from Venus.
But I am not from Mars.

602
01:01:03,376 --> 01:01:07,457
Think I'll give you a pen so you
can write that I never gave you one?

603
01:01:07,457 --> 01:01:09,535
I request your attention!

604
01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:14,740
I was not given a pen,
so I will express it orally

605
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:23,223
Vladimir Nikolaevich, if you do not
instantly cancel your order
to halt garage demolition...

606
01:01:23,223 --> 01:01:27,218
...then I am instantly
going into retirement.

607
01:01:27,218 --> 01:01:29,530
I am counting to three

608
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:32,648
One!  Two!...

609
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:38,232
Pavel Ivanovich, this doesn't
seem to be the time or the place
to discuss this issue.

610
01:01:38,232 --> 01:01:41,426
No, it is!
I am counting.

611
01:01:42,725 --> 01:01:45,659
Two
Two and a half

612
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:49,658
Three!
Three and a half...

613
01:01:50,948 --> 01:01:57,890
Pavel Ivanovich, nobody can
take away your right to your
lawful rest...

614
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,934
Pavel Ivanovich...

615
01:02:08,408 --> 01:02:10,972
Pavel Ivanovich

616
01:02:21,073 --> 01:02:24,956
Our car is over there...

617
01:02:27,312 --> 01:02:31,376
--Where to now?  Back to work?

618
01:02:36,671 --> 01:02:41,532
--Home?
--I have no home, Bobylev

619
01:02:41,532 --> 01:02:48,376
How about my place?
There's no one there.
We can watch hockey.

620
01:02:49,745 --> 01:02:53,136
Doesn't matter

621
01:02:53,136 --> 01:02:57,786
--I am leaving you all
--Where to?

622
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:02,752
Where to?

623
01:03:02,752 --> 01:03:05,824
To take Sorokin's place?

624
01:03:07,593 --> 01:03:10,707
Just my own

625
01:03:12,354 --> 01:03:16,567
Where once was a feast
There now stands a coffin...

626
01:03:17,926 --> 01:03:19,755
What?

627
01:03:22,076 --> 01:03:27,269
--An aimless coffin
--Sorry, which coffin?

628
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:31,775
No.  Hold it, Bobylev!

629
01:03:32,866 --> 01:03:35,070
Anyutin Lane!

630
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:40,489
I can't pay them all back.
But I will return one small debt.

631
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:42,658
Stop.

632
01:03:43,544 --> 01:03:45,463
Make a left

633
01:03:45,463 --> 01:03:49,815
--There's a ditch there.
Take pity on the vehicle.
--I said, go left!

634
01:03:53,013 --> 01:03:54,860
Faster, faster.

635
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:58,301
Why are you crawling?

636
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:05,700
--Now what?
--A puddle.  Need to check its depth.

637
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,330
Give me the steering wheel!

638
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:11,279
Step on it.  We'll cross it
by accelerating

639
01:04:11,279 --> 01:04:15,611
I tell you like an ex-tank driver,
step on it hard.

640
01:04:36,811 --> 01:04:41,208
There we are.  I didn't get
a chance to buy insurance on it.

641
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:44,605
Oh, Bobylev.

642
01:04:44,605 --> 01:04:47,672
Can't even entrust you with
a simple task.

643
01:04:47,672 --> 01:04:51,638
And to think we're leaving
the nation in your generation's hands...

644
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,483
Open the door for me.
Why do you sit there like an ass?

645
01:04:56,483 --> 01:05:00,391
Give it a rest, Pavel Ivanovich.
I am not your lackey.

646
01:05:00,391 --> 01:05:05,197
--I'm an engineer.
--Engineer?!  Where did you get
the money to buy this car?

647
01:05:05,197 --> 01:05:07,574
My dad gave me
the money.

648
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:12,596
--And who's your dad?
--A lieutenant colonel

649
01:05:15,478 --> 01:05:16,982
Which division?

650
01:05:16,982 --> 01:05:20,618
Oh, whatever.
Do what you people want.

651
01:05:20,618 --> 01:05:23,289
I no longer give a damn.

652
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:25,600
About everything.

653
01:05:43,448 --> 01:05:48,909
Anyutin Lane.

654
01:05:48,909 --> 01:05:51,670
Taken

655
01:06:20,753 --> 01:06:22,197
Stop

656
01:06:33,276 --> 01:06:35,332
--Where is "she"?
--She?

657
01:06:35,332 --> 01:06:41,444
--I don't know when they woke up
--The rope you hid from him, where is it?

658
01:06:41,444 --> 01:06:45,749
--Oh...it's here in the kitchen
--Give it to me.

659
01:06:51,738 --> 01:06:54,683
--Here
--Thanks

660
01:06:54,683 --> 01:06:57,000
You're welcome.

661
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:03,321
I am so glad you arrived.
You spoke so strangely on the phone.

662
01:07:03,321 --> 01:07:08,499
--I must inform you in advance...
--No need.

663
01:07:10,225 --> 01:07:14,784
See, Sasha speaks of you in not
so flattering terms.  But please
pay no mind to it.

664
01:07:14,784 --> 01:07:17,406
Please give me the knife.

665
01:07:17,406 --> 01:07:20,446
--Here you go...
--Thanks.  Hold here.

666
01:07:22,963 --> 01:07:25,050
--Well hold it!
--I am...

667
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:27,896
--Where is he?
--In his room.

668
01:07:29,917 --> 01:07:32,524
--No, no, this room is mine
--Where do I go?

669
01:07:32,524 --> 01:07:34,642
Right this way, please

670
01:07:34,642 --> 01:07:36,545
--Thanks
--Sure

671
01:07:39,124 --> 01:07:44,002
Sasha, see, Pavel
Ivanovich arrived in person.

672
01:07:44,002 --> 01:07:47,641
That hook

673
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:51,404
--A hook...
--What was here?
--A chandelier

674
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:55,718
--What kind?
--Crystal, with attachments

675
01:07:55,718 --> 01:07:59,082
--It was sold during the war.
--Please hand me a pen and paper

676
01:07:59,082 --> 01:08:03,093
--Got any other kind of paper?
--No.  Only the graph paper.

677
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:08,084
--Aleksandr Ivanovich Ermakov
--Move away please

678
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,714
Alright

679
01:08:09,714 --> 01:08:19,299
See, Sasha.  He'll sign the permission,
I'll go get Nastya, and all will be well.

680
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:23,007
You already brought one here.
That's quite enough.

681
01:08:23,007 --> 01:08:25,558
Shame on you.
What are you doing?

682
01:08:25,558 --> 01:08:30,355
By the way, I'll tell you as a woman...

683
01:08:30,355 --> 01:08:34,469
Citizen, the note is
in my pocket.  Don't forget.

684
01:08:35,471 --> 01:08:40,773
--Be so kind as to give me a chair
--Pavel Ivanovich, why do you bother?
--I kindly ask you.

685
01:08:40,773 --> 01:08:45,280
--We can do it ourselves...
--Thank you
--You're welcome

686
01:08:47,885 --> 01:08:50,170
And hand me the rope, please.

687
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:53,190
--Thanks
--Sure

688
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:55,854
--Take this
--Thanks

689
01:08:58,354 --> 01:09:00,975
Be careful.  You're too heavy
for this shaky table.

690
01:09:00,975 --> 01:09:03,309
--Move away please
--Where to?
--There

691
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:07,311
You wanted to hang yourself and
be a burden on my conscience

692
01:09:07,311 --> 01:09:11,521
It won't work, Ermakov.  Now,
I'll be like a rock on your conscience

693
01:09:11,521 --> 01:09:15,292
Pavel Ivanovich,
what's that for?

694
01:09:15,292 --> 01:09:18,243
--Can you keep quiet?
--I can.

695
01:09:19,433 --> 01:09:22,296
Thank you.

696
01:09:26,256 --> 01:09:30,632
--Pavel Ivanovich...
--Why?!!!!

697
01:09:34,097 --> 01:09:38,941
Why lie?  Why this low lie
that there used to be a chandelier?

698
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:41,329
But there was.

699
01:09:43,121 --> 01:09:44,600
Magician!

700
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:48,147
My respected ones!

701
01:09:48,147 --> 01:09:56,267
I tell you as a construction expert that
hooks to crystal chandeliers are
designed to hold 200 kilos

702
01:09:56,267 --> 01:09:59,049
of vertical force

703
01:10:00,726 --> 01:10:03,565
--Where do you work?
--In a kindergarden

704
01:10:04,292 --> 01:10:06,442
--Last name?
--Belozerskaya

705
01:10:06,514 --> 01:10:09,819
--Which kindergarden?
--Chukovsky Kindergarden

706
01:10:13,007 --> 01:10:16,354
Alright.  We'll keep it in mind.

707
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:23,575
I keep requesting a full overhaul
repair of this place.
And here's the result.

708
01:10:27,018 --> 01:10:31,118
Deceivers!

709
01:10:37,787 --> 01:10:41,185
In my death I request to blame
the blackmailer Ermakov, A.I.
--Vasin.

710
01:10:41,185 --> 01:10:47,489
...and comrade Belozerskaya

711
01:11:18,071 --> 01:11:20,832
Quiet, Reddy boy!

712
01:11:23,651 --> 01:11:25,914
Reddy, quit barking

713
01:11:27,457 --> 01:11:29,959
Silly boy

714
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:38,036
Pavel Ivanovich!

715
01:11:49,441 --> 01:11:57,103
Solov'eva, humanity will flicker
into infinity of space and time

716
01:11:57,103 --> 01:11:59,989
Like a singular wicked instance

717
01:11:59,989 --> 01:12:04,008
It will devour itself
like a scorpio

718
01:12:04,008 --> 01:12:08,124
Once, the depth of this water
was this high

719
01:12:08,124 --> 01:12:11,422
We used to dive from
the shore, head down

720
01:12:11,422 --> 01:12:15,365
Nobody will even believe it now.

721
01:12:17,857 --> 01:12:22,855
Dear Pavel Ivanovich, what
are you doing to yourself?
Let's go to my place.

722
01:12:22,855 --> 01:12:28,372
I live here.  There's my house.
I will feed you tea with jam.

723
01:12:28,372 --> 01:12:30,779
You like apple jam?

724
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:34,049
--I do
--Very good.

725
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:36,543
--Solov'eva,
--Yes?
--The lake must be cleaned

726
01:12:36,543 --> 01:12:40,462
--Seaweed is such a gem
--...yes...
--And it's wasting away

727
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:44,946
--Solov'eva, you know what...
--What?

728
01:12:44,946 --> 01:12:48,204
--Don't go to work today
--OK, Pavel Ivanovich

729
01:12:48,204 --> 01:12:53,821
Now go change, warm up.
You can make it up some other time.

730
01:12:53,821 --> 01:12:58,000
--I give my permission
--Sure.  I don't keep a grudge.

731
01:13:02,356 --> 01:13:05,776
Do you know Aleksandr Ermakov?

732
01:13:05,811 --> 01:13:09,049
Who? Sasha?  I do, why?

733
01:13:10,165 --> 01:13:13,900
--As soon as you change, run over to his place.
--Watch your step, Pavel Ivanovich

734
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:18,971
Tell him Vasin gives
permission for the wedding

735
01:13:18,971 --> 01:13:21,735
--Just as planned before
--Sure

736
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:27,915
Tell them I'll come later on
Sunday to repair their table

737
01:13:27,915 --> 01:13:33,121
I'll tell.  What's your size,
I'll give you my daddy's pants

738
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:36,082
--if they fit
--Thanks, but I can't now.

739
01:13:36,082 --> 01:13:42,970
--I have much to do, Natasha dear.
You run ahead and tell him...
--He's not home anyway

740
01:13:42,970 --> 01:13:49,025
--They're at the wedding hall
--Solov'eva, you'll catch a cold.
Go change immediately

741
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:51,469
--Run ahead
--I am

742
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:31,582
OBLProject.  Hello.

743
01:14:34,322 --> 01:14:39,690
Dina.  It's me, Pavel.

744
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:46,141
--I'm listening.
--Dina, please call
Ira to the phone

745
01:14:46,141 --> 01:14:50,168
--She's not in.  She left.
--Where?

746
01:14:50,168 --> 01:14:55,303
I don't know.  Pavel,
I hate you.

747
01:14:55,303 --> 01:14:58,040
I   h a t e   y o u

748
01:15:26,654 --> 01:15:30,948
--Vasina speaking
--Masha dear

749
01:15:30,948 --> 01:15:35,326
Hi.  This is grandpa.

750
01:15:35,326 --> 01:15:38,078
--Hi Pavel.
--How's life?

751
01:15:38,078 --> 01:15:42,806
Life's fine.  Pavel, you didn't
lose my toys, did you?

752
01:15:44,115 --> 01:15:49,774
No, little one.  Masha dear,
is grandma at your place?

753
01:15:49,774 --> 01:15:54,537
No, she's not.  Did aunty
Ellie buy the Hercules kasha?

754
01:15:54,537 --> 01:16:00,333
She did.  Masha dear,
please get daddy on the phone

755
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:04,463
No, Gera went to
drop off your junk

756
01:16:04,463 --> 01:16:07,791
--Mama's home.  Want her?
--No

757
01:16:07,791 --> 01:16:14,083
--Don't disturb her
--She's free.  She's crying.
Want her?

758
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:22,555
Please tell her to forget
all the stuff I said to her

759
01:16:22,555 --> 01:16:29,766
Tell her grandpa was under
lots of nervous stress

760
01:16:29,766 --> 01:16:35,777
Did you get that?  Nervous...
Solov'eva!
Sorry, Mashen'ka...

761
01:16:36,194 --> 01:16:39,262
Solov'eva, I can see you.

762
01:16:40,711 --> 01:16:45,724
--What, Pavel Ivanovich?
--I entrusted a man's life to you,
and you're roaming around here.

763
01:16:45,724 --> 01:16:52,609
--If you don't want to, I'll go myself.
--OK, I'm off.  Don't worry.

764
01:16:56,553 --> 01:17:01,568
Vasin speaking.  Oh, sorry Masha dear.
Where were we?

765
01:17:01,568 --> 01:17:08,540
Stress.  Only don't let them lead
you by the nose, grandpa.
You don't have any stress.

766
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:12,372
You have a magic piece
of glass in your eye

767
01:17:12,372 --> 01:17:17,413
And you must shed some tears
very urgently for it to fall out.

768
01:17:17,413 --> 01:17:22,009
Or else your heart
will turn to ice

769
01:17:23,461 --> 01:17:25,867
Cry this instance,
you hear me!

770
01:17:25,867 --> 01:17:31,332
I already cried,
Masha dear

771
01:17:31,332 --> 01:17:35,610
You did?  Then, grandpa,
you must now sing a song

772
01:17:35,610 --> 01:17:38,236
So that all the imps get scared

773
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:43,243
and threw back their hooves
all the way to Tar-tar-are, right
into forest-demon's forehead

774
01:17:43,243 --> 01:17:48,006
Russian style.
Grandpa, Tar-tar-are--where is that?

775
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:53,127
That's in the fairy tale,
Masha dear

776
01:17:57,899 --> 01:18:01,735
Comrade, pardon me,
is this horse yours?

777
01:18:01,735 --> 01:18:05,426
--The horse?  No, not mine.
--Masha dear, I'll call you back

778
01:18:07,501 --> 01:18:12,328
Comrade, then it would appear
that that's your piano?

779
01:18:12,328 --> 01:18:16,629
--It would
--Then I must apologize to you

780
01:18:16,629 --> 01:18:19,955
I was the one who
brought the cart here

781
01:18:23,727 --> 01:18:27,304
It just happened.  I was in
a rush.  Guilty as charged.

782
01:18:27,304 --> 01:18:29,680
--At your mercy
--And what?

783
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:34,905
--I wanted to ask: does the owner
know that we dragged the horse here?
--He doesn't

784
01:18:34,905 --> 01:18:39,433
--Then it must be returned
--What for?

785
01:18:39,433 --> 01:18:47,139
--So he doesn't think to worry...
--He's not thinking.  He got wasted for my $5,
and now crashed sleeping by a boat around here

786
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:51,178
--So what do you want?
--Me?  Nothing
--Nothing?!

787
01:18:51,178 --> 01:18:53,851
Then go your own way

788
01:18:53,851 --> 01:18:56,448
Look at them!
Good Samaritans!

789
01:18:56,448 --> 01:18:59,070
Some get drunk,
others chase me out

790
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:07,219
Comrade, you're wrong.

791
01:19:08,322 --> 01:19:11,169
I repeat: I stole the horse.

792
01:19:11,169 --> 01:19:14,894
While the horse driver whom we are
now badmouthing is totally innocent.

793
01:19:14,894 --> 01:19:19,392
One must not think badly of people,
not having any convincing proof for it.

794
01:19:19,392 --> 01:19:24,256
Believe me, it's horrible for everyone,
and first of all, for oneself.

795
01:19:24,256 --> 01:19:28,523
--Prove it.  Prove it!
--What must I prove?

796
01:19:28,523 --> 01:19:32,110
That you steal horses.
Where are your witnesses?

797
01:19:33,017 --> 01:19:35,336
I have none.
Just this horse.

798
01:19:35,336 --> 01:19:37,245
That's just it

799
01:19:37,245 --> 01:19:39,618
But you have the same witness

800
01:19:39,618 --> 01:19:43,659
--What?
--Let's ask the horse about
your false logic

801
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:46,683
--Is that your piano?
--Yeah
--Yeah

802
01:19:46,683 --> 01:19:52,796
No, comrade, I can actually
prove that this instrument is mine

803
01:20:15,991 --> 01:20:17,061
How was that?

804
01:20:20,014 --> 01:20:22,852
That's no proof.
Anyone can do that.

805
01:20:22,852 --> 01:20:27,701
Oh, anyone?!  Then I will
ask you specifically.

806
01:20:27,701 --> 01:20:29,708
I am waiting

807

What will you play for us?

01:21:02,615 --> 01:21:06,080
Buddy
Hey, buddy!

809
01:21:07,227 --> 01:21:11,564
--Don't make noise.  There's people around.
--Oh, there he is!

810
01:21:11,564 --> 01:21:13,701
And what did I tell you?

811
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:20,496
--Friend, I feel sorry for you
--Now do you see?

812
01:21:20,496 --> 01:21:24,263
Please don't

"Drops are falling on the rooftops
Pouring rain is falling..."

814
01:21:51,387 --> 01:22:01,865

beats his little drum."

815
01:22:07,275 --> 01:22:19,569
"Rain and sunshine signify a breaking point of fate...

816
01:22:19,569 --> 01:22:31,910
"...Skipping barefoot through ringing puddles
I rush to your arms"

817
01:22:31,945 --> 01:22:33,763
Thanks, Natasha dear
