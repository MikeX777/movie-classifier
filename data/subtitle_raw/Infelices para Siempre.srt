1
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:12,930
Mhm! Mhm!

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:17,102
Mmm.

3
00:00:18,937 --> 00:00:20,563
Mm?

4
00:00:20,688 --> 00:00:21,982
Mm.

5
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:52,220
HAPPILY EVER AFTER

6
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:56,598
UNHAPPILY EVER AFTER

7
00:00:56,767 --> 00:01:03,355
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO...

8
00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:18,830
Hi.

9
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,248
What are you doing?

10
00:01:20,332 --> 00:01:21,540
I'm waiting for you.

11
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,125
-Are you OK?
-Yes.

12
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:26,003
I just came to gather strength.

13
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:28,590
I still want to go a few
more times.

14
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:30,342
-Really?
-Yes.

15
00:01:36,097 --> 00:01:37,932
Mmm. No.

16
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,058
-Why not?
-People can see us.

17
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:43,270
-So? They'll cheer us on!
-No.

18
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,612
I don't want to go...

19
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:51,905
-ever!
-Me neither.

20
00:01:51,988 --> 00:01:54,198
I don't want to work
with the accountant!

21
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,700
Quit, baby.

22
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:56,910
No, I mean it.

23
00:01:56,993 --> 00:01:58,202
Are you going to support me?

24
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,078
-What's wrong with that?
-Nothing.

25
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:01,455
I'd love it.

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,173
-I have a surprise for you.
-What is it?

27
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,125
Promise me something...

28
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,003
That no matter what...

29
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,423
we will always make the next day
better that the last.

30
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:04,768
Love each other so much
that you are a bit of sun

31
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:06,687
and a bit of night.

32
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,318
Be together
through the gray mornings.

33
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:19,325
Laugh and watch
how love defeats time.

34
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,327
You are married now.

35
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,633
Let's go!

36
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,605
I love you, María José!

37
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,400
María José!

38
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,697
María José!
Where are my pants?

39
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,575
You've been wearing
the same pants for a week!

40
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:01,993
Your pants already
stand by themselves.

41
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:04,620
-They're my favorite...
-But they have a hole

42
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,997
in the crotch!

43
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,498
Baby, who would look
at my crotch?

44
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,208
You're right about that...

45
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,003
there's nothing to see.

46
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,218
-Lower your pants, you look old.
-And you look like my mom.

47
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,430
I'm taking your car.

48
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,807
-Why? What about yours?
-It's in the shop.

49
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,102
Why did you take it there?
I said I'd fix it.

50
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,435
-Three weeks ago!
-Yes, baby,

51
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,063
but I'm closing stuff at work
and I have a lot to do!

52
00:04:31,147 --> 00:04:32,982
I have to help the accountant!

53
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,067
But you help her
more than you help me.

54
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:36,693
Baby, come on!

55
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,367
Centennials...

56
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,077
Are you ready?
Let's go to school.

57
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,287
Stop it.

58
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,748
Kids, go to the car
while I say goodbye to dad.

59
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,458
Yes, let's go.

60
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:52,877
Here.

61
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,212
Go to the car
while I say bye to mom.

62
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,965
-I heard you.
-OK, last one...

63
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,717
-Well done, baby!
-Stop!

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,927
Go ahead, princess.

65
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,553
Don't talk like that
in front of the children.

66
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:04,638
I'm sorry, baby.

67
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:07,267
-I'm very stressed out.
-Why?

68
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,475
María José...

69
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,812
Maybe América
won't make it to the league.

70
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:11,937
Alfredo...

71
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:14,190
América always makes it
to the league.

72
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,942
You're right.

73
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,695
OK,
you'll need to take the bus.

74
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,862
The bus?

75
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,572
María José, me taking the bus?

76
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:23,950
-What's wrong with it?
-How...?

77
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:25,785
-García!
-Accountant!

78
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:27,995
I'm behind on
the sheet balances...

79
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,788
-I know!
-Yes, of course.

80
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,457
-I need my coffee.
-Of course, ma'am.

81
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,542
No!

82
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,127
-Latte, lactose...
-Of course.

83
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,297
-...two sugars.
-Latte, light, sugar.

84
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:39,298
Desy, sit on the front.

85
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,383
María José!

86
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,303
María José, please...

87
00:05:47,223 --> 00:05:48,390
Take me to work.

88
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,268
I'd love to,
but we're running late.

89
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,603
See you later.

90
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,522
Say bye to daddy, kids.

91
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,065
Bye, daddy!

92
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,233
Ouch!

93
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:05,408
We're here live
on El Heraldo Televisión,

94
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:07,202
Alejandro Cacho,
Paulina Greenham.

95
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:09,578
Yesterday was an amazing show...

96
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:11,163
-Here.
-He's talking to you.

97
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,248
Thank you.

98
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:16,293
Last night, women
received awards from the...

99
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,005
Did you like your surprise?

100
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,757
Yes, baby!

101
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,967
Thank you for the food...

102
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,385
Well, your anniversary
is an important date.

103
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,678
Yes, baby.

104
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,140
How could we forget
such an important date?

105
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,142
Alfredo, it's in two days.

106
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,478
But we're celebrating today.

107
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,313
And you're one to talk.

108
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,442
You almost killed me and you
didn't even say you're sorry.

109
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,235
It was both our fault.

110
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,153
Both our fault? Sure!

111
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,782
I'm sorry for putting
my foot under your tire!

112
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,408
It's fine, I forgive you.

113
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,368
-Quit the attitude.
-María José, don't start.

114
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,122
-I'm not liking you...
-...since the day started...

115
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:53,663
-Enough!
-Shut up!

116
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,752
This is your 20th anniversary

117
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,630
and I think
you need to celebrate.

118
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:02,005
Yes, baby but...

119
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:04,675
we don't have money
to celebrate right now.

120
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:11,015
-Oh!
-What is it?

121
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,893
Wow! Baby...

122
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,102
Wow.

123
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:18,397
Look at this,
"Happy Anniversary..."

124
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,315
"A trip to the beach".

125
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,568
It's just what I need.

126
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,653
But you're going too...

127
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,867
It's the hotel
of our honeymoon.

128
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,910
We saved our allowances,

129
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,580
the money grandma gave me
for my 15th birthday,

130
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,040
everything Jorge won
with his bets,

131
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,127
and Nina's savings.

132
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,628
That's how we paid for it.

133
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,007
-No way.
-It can't be.

134
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,092
At least we're on
the same page about this.

135
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,177
It's right.

136
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,970
So, what do we tell them?

137
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,555
We have to tell them.

138
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,055
Centennials...

139
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,727
It's cool
that we're all friends.

140
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:57,353
Mhm.

141
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:01,190
Guys, what you did for us
was really beautiful,

142
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,692
-thank you so much, but...
-But daddy has to work.

143
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,572
Yes, the month is ending
and I have a lot of work.

144
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,908
This is not a question.
You have to go on this trip.

145
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:13,827
But you can't stay alone,
who'll take care of you?

146
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:16,497
-Grandma!
-My girl!

147
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,123
So precious!

148
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,587
How are you? I'm sorry,
I know you're celebrating

149
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:27,842
and I didn't want to intrude
but... the kids invited me.

150
00:08:29,218 --> 00:08:31,678
Baby,
I didn't say hi, I'm sorry!

151
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,555
Since you're going
to the beach,

152
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,182
I bought you some sunblock.

153
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,937
Because you always
burn your ears, Alfredo.

154
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,688
And if I don't take care
of you...

155
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,315
who will?

156
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,025
Right?

157
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:48,112
Pull your pants up, Alfredo,

158
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,405
you look like a plumber!

159
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:52,533
There.

160
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,288
Thank you.

161
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,540
I don't know
whether to feel angry

162
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,042
or proud of you.

163
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,378
-They are just like their dad.
-Or like their mom.

164
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:07,088
We're like the both of you.

165
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,383
Go with God,

166
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:11,385
have a safe trip
and a good return.

167
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,637
Thank you!
In the name of the Father

168
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,638
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

169
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,140
Take care, son.

170
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,267
-Yes.
-Take care.

171
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:24,190
-Just relax.
-And try not to kill each other.

172
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,025
Wait!

173
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,905
Don't come back until you love
each other again.

174
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,545
Ladies and gentlemen,

175
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:49,923
Saguaro Airlines welcomes you
to Puerto Peñasco, Sonora.

176
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,932
A lot of people
get sick on planes.

177
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,893
Sure, but because
they get dizzy not drunk.

178
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,495
Yes...

179
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:22,957
What are your names again?

180
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:25,500
María José Márquez
and Alfredo García.

181
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,338
García, Márquez...

182
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,298
Like the writer.

183
00:10:32,967 --> 00:10:34,635
Sorry, yes.

184
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,512
THIS RESERVATION
HAS BEEN CANCELLED

185
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:38,055
SEARCH FOR RESERVATION

186
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,975
THIS RESERVATION
HAS BEEN CANCELLED

187
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,730
-You're not on the system.
-No, that can't be!

188
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:48,482
There must be something wrong,
call your manager, please.

189
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,027
-I am the manager.
-Fuck!

190
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,280
I used to manage Hibris,

191
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,823
Mexico's biggest
international company.

192
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,618
And I went from manager to VP

193
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,955
because I could find solutions.

194
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,753
-Yes...
-Shut up!

195
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,300
I have a solution.

196
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,722
The honeymoon suite.

197
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,017
Welcome.

198
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:28,272
-Your bag, please, sir.
-Yes, thanks.

199
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,482
No, thank you.

200
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,402
We're planning on
remodeling the suite

201
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:37,322
but some other things
have come up and...

202
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,533
we haven't done it.

203
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:46,790
Tomorrow we'll take out
the boxes, brooms,

204
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,085
and the dust, I apologize.

205
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,585
-Hey.
-Yes?

206
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:52,087
What's the Wi-Fi password?

207
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,505
No Wi-Fi up here.

208
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,090
With caps on?

209
00:11:56,175 --> 00:12:00,387
No, I meant
that there's no Wi-Fi up here.

210
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:01,930
Oh, OK.

211
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:04,558
OK but...

212
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,645
apart from these little details,

213
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,647
everything works great.

214
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,067
Look,
the hot tub is still there.

215
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:17,655
Too bad it's broken.

216
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:21,117
Oh, and the AC...

217
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:24,912
is also broken.

218
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:28,207
Yes...

219
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,963
Apart from that...

220
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,382
everything works great.

221
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,970
Sometimes we have
power outages.

222
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,933
Tomorrow we'll fix
all these little details.

223
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,935
See you, thank you.

224
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:01,032
Look!

225
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:23,928
-Hello?
-Happy anniversary!

226
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,722
Good morning.

227
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,182
How was the trip?

228
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,268
Everything was fine,
thank you.

229
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,938
Majo, how's my son's foot?

230
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,025
Fine, ma'am, everything's fine.

231
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:39,445
Well, I'm just here cleaning up
your house

232
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:40,988
because it was really dirty.

233
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:42,990
I'll let you talk to your son.

234
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,788
-Hi, mommy.
-Alfredito.

235
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:54,543
Don't forget to put on
your sunblock, please.

236
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,212
You're in
the middle of nowhere,

237
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:58,255
there are no hospitals,
no doctors,

238
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,258
-and you even get fevers.
-Yes, mommy.

239
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:04,428
So cool, the weather is amazing.

240
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,352
Shit!

241
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:22,487
♪ Here's your baby ♪
♪ Your bitch from the future ♪

242
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:24,782
♪ Hard, hard ♪
♪ Bitch from the future ♪

243
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,283
♪ Here's your baby ♪
♪ Your bitch from the future ♪

244
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,162
♪ Hard, hard ♪
♪ Bitch from the future ♪

245
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,372
♪ Here's your baby ♪

246
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,458
I'm sorry, ma'am, I apologize.

247
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:37,043
I forgot to explain
the thing with the water...

248
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:39,838
No, it's not a thing.
There is no water.

249
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:40,923
No, there is...

250
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:43,050
From four to five
in the morning

251
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:46,095
and sometimes at six p.m.
But only for 15 minutes.

252
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:47,763
It's a phenomenon.

253
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:49,138
Well, you're scamming my kids.

254
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,517
Because they spent
all their savings on this.

255
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,395
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

256
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,357
I swear that tomorrow
everything will work perfectly.

257
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,985
Despite being
the honeymoon suite,

258
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,028
in 20 years
everything falls apart.

259
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,532
OK, I want less apologies
and more action.

260
00:15:19,587 --> 00:15:22,088
To the left, to the right.

261
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:27,343
You're fine, tomorrow
you'll be good as new.

262
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,640
Let me see what I have here.

263
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:40,357
Never mix bacanora
with eggnog and chiltepín.

264
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,317
It's to die for.

265
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,905
I'll give you
a cocktail of Meloxicam,

266
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,450
Celecoxib,

267
00:15:49,617 --> 00:15:51,243
Parisiprodol,

268
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,413
and a bit of Tramadol,
that will make you feel...

269
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,965
No, you know what?
I'm feeling better already.

270
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,258
Drop your pants!

271
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:10,970
-No, Doctor...
-Drop your pants!

272
00:16:11,597 --> 00:16:13,640
It's fine.

273
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:21,857
Bend over, it's fine.
Relax!

274
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,400
Here we go.

275
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,068
Here we go.

276
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,403
I'll count to three.

277
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:29,490
One...

278
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,007
Good morning.

279
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,097
Nice day, huh?

280
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,773
Yes...

281
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,983
A lot of sun.

282
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,287
BEACH TOURNAMENT

283
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,385
García...

284
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,053
Hi, accountant, how are you?

285
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,638
I'm waiting for the...

286
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:36,807
Right, sorry.

287
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,933
-The balance!
-Right!

288
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,185
I'm sorry,
I forgot to send it.

289
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,230
There are so many things here.
Could I send it later?

290
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:45,357
-I'm...
-Later?

291
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,068
If you need it now,
I'll send it. Of course.

292
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,987
-Send it right away!
-My pleasure.

293
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,907
-It's been days...
-See you,

294
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,742
say hi to everyone
in the office for me.

295
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:56,660
-Sure, bye!
-Have a...

296
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,502
Yes!

297
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:06,587
-Shit!
-Auch!

298
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,423
I'm sorry!

299
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,883
Sir, are you hurt?

300
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,427
No, I'm fine, don't worry.
Thanks.

301
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:17,807
I work here, do you want me
to take you to the doctor?

302
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:19,808
No, really I'm fine.

303
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,228
It didn't hurt at all.

304
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:24,813
OK then.

305
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,357
Thanks.

306
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,575
What happened?

307
00:18:37,952 --> 00:18:39,745
A risky move playing volleyball.

308
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,163
Oh!

309
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,873
You have to come closer,

310
00:18:42,998 --> 00:18:45,375
I'm stealing
the other room's Wi-Fi.

311
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,962
-Hi, dad!
-Hi, baby!

312
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,087
What happened, dad?

313
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,590
-Did my mom hit you?
-No, baby!

314
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,217
He got hurt playing volleyball.

315
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,552
Volleyball?

316
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,095
But you get tired playing chess.

317
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,307
Alfredito, look at your ears!

318
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,227
-They're sunburnt!
-Yes, mommy.

319
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,603
Why aren't you fighting?

320
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:06,605
Is grandma wearing my silk robe?

321
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,857
Yes, she's very happy.

322
00:19:07,982 --> 00:19:10,400
How's the trip,
are you having fun?

323
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,735
Is the hotel the same
as your remembered it?

324
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:14,613
Exactly the same, baby!

325
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,740
Excuse me, it's hot.

326
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,033
Yes.

327
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,328
-Oh!
-What was that?

328
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:26,208
Shit!

329
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,838
Don't move him.

330
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,515
Mom, what happened to him?

331
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:44,017
-We can't stay here!
-I want my money back!

332
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,227
Calm down, please.

333
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,980
We don't want to ruin
your holidays,

334
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:53,943
just for tonight,
in memory of Mister Tolstoi...

335
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:58,407
vodka on the house!

336
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:01,577
Fine...

337
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:07,123
How can you drink
in a moment like this?

338
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,167
What's the problem?

339
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:13,838
I mean, may he rest in peace,
but this is free alcohol.

340
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,965
I talked to him.

341
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:18,177
No wonder he killed himself.

342
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,765
-Hi, how are you?
-Hi!

343
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:26,393
How's your face after
the ball hit?

344
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,937
That was your risky move?

345
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,647
Stopping the ball with your face

346
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,190
-is a risky move.
-Of course.

347
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,400
Did you go to the doctor?
It was hard...

348
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,362
No, I'm fine, thank you.

349
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:38,863
That was brave,
because it was really hard.

350
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:43,243
-Thank you.
-Happy anniversary to you!

351
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,205
Happy anniversary to you!

352
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:51,293
We all wish you...

353
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:56,130
Happy anniversary to you!

354
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:58,633
It's a gift from your kids,

355
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,593
and they sent a note.

356
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,515
"So you remember this day...

357
00:21:06,767 --> 00:21:08,268
forever".

358
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:14,232
-Sir.
-Sorry. Yes.

359
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,610
-Let's go.
-Yes.

360
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,865
I'm sorry...
I... Yes...

361
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,618
How long have you two
been together?

362
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:26,912
Too much.

363
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,247
OK...

364
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:30,623
we'll let you celebrate.

365
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,750
Congratulations!

366
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,712
There isn't much to celebrate.

367
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,922
Baby!

368
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,507
Baby, wait!

369
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,010
It was a joke, of course
there's plenty to celebrate.

370
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:45,347
-Like that old woman's ass?
-Old? She's so young.

371
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,017
Really, Alfredo?

372
00:21:48,475 --> 00:21:50,602
On our anniversary?

373
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,650
You're right.

374
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,653
Maybe there's nothing
to celebrate.

375
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,768
We were going to make every day
better than the last.

376
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,147
We made good things...

377
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:39,192
I think we're
just fooling ourselves.

378
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:43,238
And there's only one solution
for this.

379
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,575
Divorce.

380
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,827
Really?

381
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,707
Is that what you want?

382
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,083
It's not that I want it!

383
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:57,877
We're hurting the kids.

384
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,590
Look at everything they did
so that we would stop fighting.

385
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:04,760
I'm sorry.

386
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:20,067
What do we do now?

387
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,735
Can you sleep on the couch?

388
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,615
Yes.

389
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:46,175
I'm married to
the hottest woman in Mexico!

390
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,847
And I to the nicest man
in the world!

391
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,767
At least someone
is having a good time.

392
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,773
Happy anniversary.

393
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,400
Same.

394
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,702
Happy anniversary!

395
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:38,728
What are you doing here?

396
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,855
Didn't you sleep on the couch?

397
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,275
When did I switch places?

398
00:24:48,197 --> 00:24:51,448
-Hello?
-Happy anniversary!

399
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,452
-Good morning.
-How was the trip?

400
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,788
Majo, how's my son's foot?

401
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,877
Well, I'm just here
cleaning up your house

402
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,420
because it was really dirty.

403
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:05,963
I think your mom
has Alzheimer's.

404
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,887
-Hi, mommy.
-Alfredito.

405
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,388
My love.

406
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:17,933
Don't forget to put on
your sunblock, please.

407
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:23,690
Shit...!

408
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,782
♪ Here's your baby ♪
♪ Your bitch from the future ♪

409
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,118
♪ Hard, hard ♪
♪ Bitch from the future ♪

410
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,870
♪ Here's your baby ♪
♪ Your bitch from the future ♪

411
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,082
♪ Hard, hard ♪
♪ Bitch from the future ♪

412
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,292
-There's no water!
-No, there is.

413
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,335
-From four to five...
-And six to seven,

414
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,045
and the plumber,
you already said that.

415
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:49,215
And I told you
that you're scamming my kids,

416
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,550
because they spent
all their savings on this.

417
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:53,845
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

418
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,138
Despite being
the honeymoon suite,

419
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,223
in 20 years
everything falls apart.

420
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:06,190
You're fine, tomorrow
you'll be good as new.

421
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:07,400
Ouch!

422
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,818
But you said
the same yesterday.

423
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,403
I don't remember it.

424
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:13,907
Let me see what I have.

425
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:21,957
Never mix bacanora
with eggnog and chiltepín.

426
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,667
It's to die for.

427
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:29,588
I'll make you
a cocktail of Meloxicam,

428
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:31,675
Celecoxib,

429
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,385
Parisiprodol,

430
00:26:33,552 --> 00:26:36,387
and a bit of Tramadol
that will make you feel...

431
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:41,810
Wait...

432
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,732
Drop your pants, man!

433
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,443
Drop your pants!

434
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:54,947
Bend over!

435
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,075
One...

436
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,622
One daiquiri, please.

437
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,677
García, I can't believe it!

438
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,970
Good morning.
I sent you the sheet...

439
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,347
You haven't sent anything,

440
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,975
-you're so irresponsible!
-You don't have it yet?

441
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,185
That's weird,
I sent it yesterday.

442
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:35,363
-Come here!
-Lady, what happened?

443
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:36,990
-Sure.
-Don't let me down!

444
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,992
Say hi to everyone...

445
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:42,370
I can't leave the front desk.

446
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,872
I can't be under the sun,
my skin is very sensitive.

447
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,587
-Shit!
-Again, shit!

448
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:51,922
Who's that?

449
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:53,382
Mister Tolstoi.

450
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:55,217
Didn't he killed himself?

451
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:56,467
Lady, don't say that.

452
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:00,930
I work here.

453
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:02,598
Do you want me to take you
to the doctor?

454
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:09,855
The Russian is alive!

455
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,108
What? Didn't he kill himself
yesterday?

456
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:15,487
It's like I lived
all of this yesterday.

457
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,038
Hi, dad! What happened, dad?

458
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,332
Did my mom hit you?

459
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:30,752
Alfredito, look at your ears!

460
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:32,503
They're sunburnt!

461
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:35,132
Mom, why is my dad so pale?

462
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,217
-Kids, what day is today?
-What do you mean?

463
00:28:38,427 --> 00:28:40,470
It's your anniversary.

464
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,388
Oh!

465
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,733
Happy anniversary to you!

466
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:56,903
Happy anniversary to you!

467
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,197
You must've done something.

468
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,615
I did something?

469
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,408
Why do you always blame me?

470
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,618
Sorry, I'm used to it.

471
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:06,037
"Used to it."

472
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:08,038
Mmm...

473
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,250
-I know what to do.
-What?

474
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,837
We'll go to sleep,

475
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,298
and tomorrow
when we wake up,

476
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,928
-everything will be fine.
-Brilliant idea!

477
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,453
-Hello?
-Happy anniversary!

478
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,000
Uf!

479
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,642
Ladies and gentlemen

480
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,810
Again, it's not up to us.

481
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,772
Saguaro Airlines doesn't fly
every single day.

482
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,483
But if you want, I can book you
a flight tomorrow

483
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:20,945
to Mexico City
at 10 in the morning.

484
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:22,780
It has to be today.

485
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,532
I'm sorry, sir.

486
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,492
You don't know who I am!

487
00:30:26,617 --> 00:30:28,662
Less apologies and more action!

488
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:33,498
This is insulting
to our rights as passengers.

489
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,460
I swear I'm not with this lady.

490
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,880
How are going to get
out of here?

491
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:41,048
-Let's relax.
-Relax?

492
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:42,758
Do you think someone will drop

493
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,760
from the sky
and come down to save us?

494
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,145
Tsst, tsst.

495
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,647
You need to get out of here?

496
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,200
So we're going to stop...

497
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,368
But chill.

498
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,668
It's 10,000 dollars.

499
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,588
We have...

500
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,178
-How much do you have?
-Yes, um...

501
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:35,562
-3000?
-Yes, and on the card

502
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:37,022
I have $17,600.

503
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:38,732
Withdraw in batches of 3000,

504
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:41,233
or the ATM
might swallow your card.

505
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:45,613
And... my ring.

506
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,865
I won't need it anymore.

507
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,828
It's pink coral
and it's hand made.

508
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,375
I don't think it'll be enough.

509
00:31:57,917 --> 00:31:58,918
Please!

510
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:02,213
We just want to see
our kids again.

511
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:08,593
Fine...

512
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,347
come on!

513
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:13,265
Just because
I have a heart of gold.

514
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,433
Mm.

515
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,698
This is safe, right?

516
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:31,075
Of course! The safest.

517
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:37,665
Excuse me,
I think we should get off...

518
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,125
Alfredo, don't be afraid!

519
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,293
The pilot said it's safe!

520
00:32:41,502 --> 00:32:44,172
And I believe him
but look at that...

521
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,885
What's wrong?
Why are you nervous?

522
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,637
-Is it the money?
-Yeah!

523
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,180
-It's my cousin's.
-Oh!

524
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:56,475
What does he do?

525
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,935
He's a farmer.

526
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:00,522
A farmer of what?

527
00:33:02,565 --> 00:33:05,693
Stop, you're surrounded!

528
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,240
-Damn!
-"No name"

529
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,242
-and "Silver doll".
-I told you!

530
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,332
Shoot!

531
00:33:19,457 --> 00:33:23,543
You don't have
permission to take off.

532
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:26,213
-Mom! I told you!
-Don't be a scaredy-cat!

533
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:34,222
Speed up!
Don't let them catch us.

534
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:35,973
You really are weird!

535
00:33:52,282 --> 00:33:56,118
Did we lose them?
We did!

536
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:00,873
We're going down.

537
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:03,167
Plane going down!

538
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,503
We hit it, plane going down!

539
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:07,963
No!

540
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:23,312
-Hello?
-Happy...!

541
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,565
-Your mom.
-Did you hang up on her?

542
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,317
She won't remember it anyway.

543
00:34:27,858 --> 00:34:31,570
Alfredo, we need to find
a solution for this.

544
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:34,073
We did the same yesterday
and see what happened.

545
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,078
I think we're cursed.

546
00:34:43,082 --> 00:34:44,542
Yes...

547
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,502
there it is.

548
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,337
What did you see?

549
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,090
A tiny winged being.

550
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:53,675
Who winked?

551
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:56,720
A being with wings.

552
00:34:57,222 --> 00:34:58,222
Fine.

553
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,307
We're cursed?

554
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,103
It's a spell that you
brought upon yourselves.

555
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:05,855
Can you help us?

556
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,982
You didn't listen to me
the last time,

557
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:10,358
how dare you come here
and ask for help?

558
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:15,072
Not even the toad
can help you.

559
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:18,450
Or maybe it will...

560
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:19,993
if you find it.

561
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,747
Help each other out.

562
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:27,793
It's not something
you're looking for.

563
00:35:28,418 --> 00:35:31,297
It's something you find.

564
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,732
What did she mean?

565
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,025
Alfredo,
I don't think she knows.

566
00:35:53,152 --> 00:35:55,530
I think we need
to go find the toad.

567
00:35:55,613 --> 00:35:58,282
Do whatever you
want, I'm going with my kids.

568
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,618
When you can't find
a solution, find an exit.

569
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:07,542
-Oh!
-Ouch! Ouch!

570
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:27,018
How long does the bus take?

571
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:29,980
Emm, not much,
about two days.

572
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,148
One day by car.

573
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:34,818
But the roads are dangerous.

574
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,907
It's rabbits mating season
and they're everywhere.

575
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,032
Huh.

576
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,955
Are you stealing my meds?

577
00:36:46,455 --> 00:36:48,248
-No.
-OK.

578
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:54,505
Do you have a car?

579
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:57,383
-Yes, but it's the hotel's.
-Give me the keys.

580
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:58,758
-Excuse me?
-Give me the keys!

581
00:36:58,927 --> 00:37:00,845
-Miss, I can't...
-Give it!

582
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,680
-I can't!
-Give them to me!

583
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:04,057
Please?

584
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,643
It's a black...

585
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:09,853
Jeep.

586
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:18,947
"The alvarius toad has been
considered a magical being

587
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,450
with great powers
for many centuries".

588
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,730
No, move away!

589
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:54,940
No, please, no!

590
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,360
No, move away!

591
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:02,448
No! No!

592
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:08,578
No!

593
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:10,873
Let me go! Let me go!

594
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,355
No, no, no...

595
00:38:36,232 --> 00:38:37,900
No!

596
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,825
Hi, dad!
What happened, dad?

597
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,535
Did my mom hit you?

598
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:32,997
Fine...

599
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:37,668
Just because I have
a heart of gold.

600
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:39,295
Hey...

601
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:43,590
Have you considered
another means of transport?

602
00:39:44,092 --> 00:39:47,010
Because the airplane
is too flashy.

603
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,655
-Is the engine broken?
-What happened?

604
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,823
The engine is broken?

605
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:10,117
How are going to get back?

606
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,868
For real?

607
00:40:37,645 --> 00:40:40,063
Hey, where are you going?

608
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:22,857
Hi, dad!

609
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:25,817
What happened, dad?
Did my mom hit you?

610
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,237
I fell asleep under the sun.

611
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:30,238
And what happened to you, mom?

612
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:34,493
Baby, if I tell you,
you won't believe it.

613
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,330
Alfredito, look at your ears!

614
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,540
They're sunburnt!

615
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,293
Yes, mommy.

616
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,837
Is the hotel
the same as your remembered it?

617
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:48,340
-Let me see!
-Hey!

618
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:52,678
This girl can't stay still.

619
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:55,097
Nina, do that again.

620
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,267
Ouch!

621
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:01,228
Do you remember what you said
when we were getting on the cab?

622
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:03,105
-No.
-That we shouldn't get back

623
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,815
until we loved each other again.

624
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:07,652
That's it.

625
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:10,195
-That's it!
-Yes!

626
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,197
That's it.

627
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,990
What was that?

628
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:18,828
HOME

629
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:23,542
Good morning, beautiful baby.

630
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,003
How's the love of my life?

631
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:29,548
I'm great, my love!

632
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:36,805
-Hello?
-Happy anniversary!

633
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,182
Thank you!

634
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:42,812
-How was the trip?
-It was wonderful!

635
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,940
You know how much
I enjoy being with your son

636
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,360
and how much I love him.

637
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:51,403
Majo, are you feeling well?

638
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:53,238
Don't over do it.

639
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,532
Are you sure of this, my love?

640
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,660
Baby, of course!
I always do it.

641
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:01,038
And I can go through anything
with you by my side.

642
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:03,957
That's so cute!

643
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:07,168
Really cute! One...

644
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,712
Fuc...!

645
00:43:12,967 --> 00:43:16,387
See? We all have
a reason to live for.

646
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:18,930
You just have to find yours.

647
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:22,225
Love will save the world.

648
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,730
Damn Russian,
you're really buffed.

649
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:32,068
Can you put sunblock on me,
my dear?

650
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,903
Of course, darling!

651
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:40,202
-García!
-Hi, ma'am, good morning.

652
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:41,453
You're so irresponsible!

653
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:42,830
You said you'd send me...

654
00:43:42,913 --> 00:43:46,917
I'm with my wife and my only job
is to make her happy.

655
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,710
-Bye.
-García!

656
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,255
That was so sweet of you!

657
00:43:51,713 --> 00:43:53,757
It's sweet you find it sweet!

658
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,093
Sorry,
that almost hit you, right?

659
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,847
Hey, be careful,
you almost hit my wife.

660
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:02,390
Sorry.

661
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:04,602
I'm sorry!

662
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,020
Look, Nina...

663
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,773
See how mommy and daddy
love each other!

664
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,150
Look.

665
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:13,777
-Ew, yuck!
-You're weird!

666
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,362
We're in love.

667
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,700
-What was that?
-What was that?

668
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,077
-It was Cupid, honey.
-Yeah.

669
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,705
Happy anniversary!

670
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,332
How long have you been together?

671
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:27,708
Twenty years.

672
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:29,877
But they'll never be enough.

673
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:31,670
Never enough!

674
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,945
Hey...

675
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:59,072
-What if we try?
-No.

676
00:44:59,532 --> 00:45:00,573
Sure?

677
00:45:01,117 --> 00:45:02,952
-Maybe it works.
-What...?

678
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,040
Baby, this has been one
of the happiest days

679
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:09,165
of my life but...

680
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,920
I'm so tired,
you understand, right?

681
00:45:13,587 --> 00:45:14,713
Of course, my dear.

682
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:16,882
I'll always understand you.

683
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:21,845
Well...

684
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,638
Good night, my love.

685
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:29,895
-I love you so much, my dear!
-I love you too.

686
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,832
HOME

687
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:11,603
-Hello?
-Happy...

688
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:13,313
anniversary!

689
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:18,443
-See? I told you.
-What?

690
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:22,322
What do you mean what?
We had to...

691
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:25,617
Do you think that'll help?

692
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:36,628
In memory of Mister Tolstoi...

693
00:46:36,837 --> 00:46:38,172
vodka on the house!

694
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:40,132
-Oh!
-Oh!

695
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,143
Cheers!

696
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:55,772
More!

697
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,998
No, I'll be on top.

698
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:17,835
Oh! Oh, God! OK.

699
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,342
-No, wait.
-Now what?

700
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:24,718
-Wait.
-What is it?

701
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,262
-Wait just a little.
-What happened?

702
00:47:27,637 --> 00:47:28,722
Alfredo junior is distracted.

703
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,682
You know what? No.
Not this.

704
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,600
I'm done!

705
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:35,270
We'll take this seriously.

706
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,105
Yes.

707
00:47:38,857 --> 00:47:40,900
-Oh!
-Baby, you're bleeding!

708
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,903
-I don't care, kiss me!
-OK.

709
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:47,032
Alfredo, I'm getting wet.

710
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:52,495
-Good. It was about time.
-No! It's water!

711
00:47:55,457 --> 00:47:57,125
Make it stop!

712
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,252
Oh!

713
00:47:58,335 --> 00:47:59,587
María José?

714
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:00,795
Why!

715
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,465
-Cover it!
-I hate it!

716
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:09,012
Come on, it's not a big deal.

717
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:11,180
It is a big deal.

718
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:13,892
For a man this is
a very tough thing.

719
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,727
Not tough enough.

720
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:18,272
Sorry.

721
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,990
Happy anniversary to you!

722
00:48:34,705 --> 00:48:36,998
Hard, hard
Bitch from the future

723
00:48:37,082 --> 00:48:38,208
Here's your baby

724
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:39,960
Drop your pants!

725
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,545
Please try to not die today.

726
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:45,382
You have no shame.

727
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:48,802
I gave you the best speech
and you still killed yourself.

728
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,142
-Hello?
-Happy anniversary!

729
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,398
I give up.

730
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:05,193
What do we do?

731
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,572
Why don't we just relax,

732
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:13,535
take a few days,
take it easy and let it flow?

733
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:15,537
I don't understand.
What do you mean?

734
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:17,705
I've been working nonstop
for 20 years,

735
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:19,248
we're on the beach,

736
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,418
we don't have to go back home,

737
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:23,628
it's any working man's fantasy!

738
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:26,840
Plus when I relax,
I have the best ideas.

739
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,508
A 40% tip.

740
00:49:29,677 --> 00:49:30,968
Thanks you crazy bastard!

741
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:34,138
Whatever you need
whenever you're here.

742
00:49:40,062 --> 00:49:41,480
García! You haven't sent...

743
00:49:41,563 --> 00:49:43,773
I can't hear you!
There's... And...

744
00:49:43,857 --> 00:49:45,900
Can you hear me?

745
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,038
Sorry, it almost hit you.

746
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,333
Don't worry about it.
I have good reflexes.

747
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:04,712
Hey!

748
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:06,838
Thank you!

749
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:08,173
Oh!

750
00:50:08,382 --> 00:50:12,218
I'm sorry, Russian, you must've
died a lot of times.

751
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:16,723
I can imagine.

752
00:50:25,982 --> 00:50:27,233
Thank you.

753
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:33,907
You're not ugly, Russian.

754
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:38,578
Screw it!

755
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,247
I'll give you something
to live for.

756
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:54,010
What's your name?

757
00:50:55,553 --> 00:50:59,473
Yes, I'm María José Márquez,
you're Tolstoi what?

758
00:51:08,108 --> 00:51:10,777
Oh my God!
This one...

759
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:14,697
This is the first time I...

760
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,163
No, wait!

761
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,417
Wait, it's just that
I haven't done this in a while,

762
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,043
not even with my husband!

763
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:30,047
So, I need like...

764
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:31,673
to prepare a little bit more,

765
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:37,637
because if you and I
knew each other a bit more

766
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:41,475
I'd be more relaxed,
because I'm really tense!

767
00:51:41,558 --> 00:51:43,310
And I don't...

768
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:46,855
Wait!

769
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:49,523
Damn Russian!

770
00:52:13,423 --> 00:52:15,300
This is Jorgito,

771
00:52:15,592 --> 00:52:16,927
as handsome as his dad.

772
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,055
I just need to know
who his dad is.

773
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,890
This is Desy, my teenager.

774
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:24,935
Here she was in a good mood,

775
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:27,312
although her face says
otherwise.

776
00:52:29,022 --> 00:52:31,273
And my princess Nina.

777
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,152
The apple of my eye.

778
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:37,655
The most beautiful thing
in my life.

779
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,953
Do you always talk this nice
about the people you love?

780
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:46,540
Yes.

781
00:53:04,307 --> 00:53:05,683
No, sorry...

782
00:53:06,142 --> 00:53:07,143
-I can't.
-Sorry.

783
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,353
Will your mom
support her too?

784
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:12,107
Baby...

785
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,700
-Listen, please.
-No! Don't even think about it!

786
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:23,535
I don't care
if you sleep with her.

787
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:27,288
I almost did it with the Russian
before he killed himself again.

788
00:53:27,372 --> 00:53:28,373
What?

789
00:53:28,457 --> 00:53:30,792
You forgot about the call
with the kids.

790
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:34,045
If you want to get out of here,
don't do it for me,

791
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:36,213
at least do it for them.

792
00:54:51,832 --> 00:54:54,958
Alfredo, I'm sorry
for blaming you for everything.

793
00:54:59,172 --> 00:55:03,968
We are both responsible.

794
00:55:05,428 --> 00:55:10,267
It hasn't been easy to leave
my job to take care of the kids.

795
00:55:11,685 --> 00:55:13,603
I liked my job.

796
00:55:13,937 --> 00:55:15,730
I didn't ask you
to leave your job.

797
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:18,232
You didn't ask me
to keep it either.

798
00:55:19,442 --> 00:55:21,527
Actually, you're lucky.

799
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:25,198
I'd love to stay all day
at home with the kids.

800
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:37,460
I don't like what we are now.

801
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,170
Me neither.

802
00:55:41,715 --> 00:55:43,298
What do we do?

803
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,893
Keep trying.

804
00:56:23,715 --> 00:56:26,550
-Hello?
-Happy anniversary!

805
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:28,678
Ma'am, don't wear my clothes.

806
00:56:44,193 --> 00:56:47,530
I study Russian.

807
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:03,087
Nice and up.

808
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:08,258
Yei!

809
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,013
Drop your pants, man!

810
00:57:20,772 --> 00:57:21,940
Ready?

811
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:23,315
Ready!

812
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:26,068
Hi, dad!

813
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:29,280
Happy anniversary to you!

814
00:57:30,157 --> 00:57:32,658
One, two, three.

815
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,548
To know the world...

816
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:49,675
To know the world...

817
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,885
Come on!

818
00:57:51,052 --> 00:57:54,013
To know the world
and everything in it.

819
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:56,265
To know the world
and everything in it.

820
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,810
To know the world
and everything in it.

821
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,605
To know the world
and everything in it.

822
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,565
Are you OK?

823
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:09,278
Are you talking to me?

824
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,280
Yes, are you OK?

825
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,158
Yes, everything's fine. Thanks.

826
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,995
A few things here and there,
nothing major.

827
00:58:17,162 --> 00:58:19,997
Everything's fine,
thanks for asking.

828
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,457
Yes, all good.

829
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:26,753
This way, please.

830
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:27,922
Don't worry.

831
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,840
That rat is dead. Relax.

832
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,800
This way, please.

833
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:36,513
This is the problem.

834
00:58:38,098 --> 00:58:41,810
They were supposed to send
some Japanese electricians.

835
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:47,525
But they haven't arrived,
I'm not sure why.

836
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,568
Damn, it looks hard.

837
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,612
What? Don't say that.

838
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:53,405
I told your wife I'd fix it.

839
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,285
And with all due respect,
I'm scared of her.

840
00:58:57,618 --> 00:58:58,787
I don't blame you.

841
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,163
But deep down
she's a good person.

842
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,875
You know what?
I can help you.

843
00:59:03,958 --> 00:59:05,460
Do you know about this?

844
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:08,922
I took a class once
in high school.

845
00:59:09,047 --> 00:59:10,757
I built a little machine.

846
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,883
So I think I can do it.

847
00:59:15,762 --> 00:59:16,803
Yes.

848
00:59:17,013 --> 00:59:18,180
Yes...

849
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:19,765
Yes.

850
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:33,780
Where is the library?

851
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:37,950
Thank you!

852
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,703
-Wanna play?
-I don't know how to play.

853
00:59:40,787 --> 00:59:42,330
You don't have to, just come!

854
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:43,707
Come on!

855
01:00:04,185 --> 01:00:06,020
The soup is cold.

01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:25,288
-I didn't know you were a man.
-Good morning.

861
01:00:26,332 --> 01:00:27,417
Drink this.

862
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,672
-Have we met?
-You could say so.

863
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:34,382
-Damn...
-That's what happens

864
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:36,467
when you mix
bacanora, eggnog and chiltepín.

865
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,302
It's to die for.

866
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,347
Doctor Orozco...

867
01:00:41,597 --> 01:00:45,893
have you thought about
learning how to give shots?

868
01:00:49,105 --> 01:00:50,773
Now that you say so...

869
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:54,152
I've always wanted to have
a wave runner,

870
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,862
to get girls.

871
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,698
And then?

872
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:10,042
That's it!

873
01:01:11,252 --> 01:01:13,087
We're not going to win.

874
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:15,130
What do you mean?
Let's go! Come here!

875
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,050
When I was manager in...

876
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,633
It doesn't matter.

877
01:01:18,802 --> 01:01:22,055
Listen up. We are going to make
a plan to beat them.

878
01:01:22,138 --> 01:01:24,265
The best ones
in the best positions.

879
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:26,142
Everyone else,
stay out of the way.

880
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:28,102
Elizabeth, go to the back left.

881
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,978
Be careful with
the one in the green bikini,

882
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:32,690
because you know how she likes
to score next to the net.

883
01:01:32,773 --> 01:01:35,067
If we do this together,
we'll win!

884
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,818
Less apologies and more action!

885
01:01:36,902 --> 01:01:38,320
Come on!

886
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:41,907
"The Japanese are the best".

887
01:01:42,242 --> 01:01:44,118
This is easier than I thought.

888
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:52,960
This is very interesting.

Centennial, come here.

892
01:02:02,095 --> 01:02:04,138
Have you ever listened to
the Rolling Stones?

893
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:05,640
The Beatles?

894
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:07,308
Or Juan Gabriel?

895
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:10,728
This is good music.

896
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:13,438
Mom, stranger danger!

897
01:02:14,815 --> 01:02:15,858
Ouch!

898
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,203
Come on.

899
01:02:30,498 --> 01:02:32,082
Yes!

900
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:51,727
Huh. Done.

901
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:54,355
The problem
with the light is solved.

902
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,440
How did you do it?

903
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,860
Less apologies and more action.

904
01:03:03,823 --> 01:03:05,700
-García!
-Good morning.

905
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:08,660
-Why haven't you sent...?
-Right, your balance.

906
01:03:08,995 --> 01:03:11,038
You know what?
I won't send it.

907
01:03:11,122 --> 01:03:12,957
-What?
-Wanna know why?

908
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:14,458
Because I don't want to.

909
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:15,710
García, you're so rude!

910
01:03:15,793 --> 01:03:18,587
-Ma'am, don't get upset.
-A terrible employee...

911
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:19,755
It's bad for your health.

912
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:23,717
And the next time you want
coffee, go get it yourself.

913
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,637
-García!
-Walking helps varicose veins.

914
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,015
-You're insulting me!
-See you, good day.

915
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,268
What did you just do?

916
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:34,270
I think I quit.

917
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:37,690
-No!
-Calm down.

918
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,568
I didn't like my job anyway.

919
01:03:40,777 --> 01:03:41,818
Oh!

920
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,655
And I think you
don't like yours either.

921
01:03:44,822 --> 01:03:46,323
Yes and no.

922
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,995
I studied Tourism in Mexico City

923
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,165
because I wanted to get
to know the world.

924
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:58,793
But I've been stuck in
this hotel for 10 years now.

925
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:06,052
I don't have the attitude
nor the money to do it.

926
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:08,137
Yes...

927
01:04:08,888 --> 01:04:10,598
-You know what?
-What?

928
01:04:10,723 --> 01:04:13,350
If you really want it,
you can do it.

929
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,187
You think?

930
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,282
Let's go check
the water problem.

931
01:04:27,698 --> 01:04:29,575
Yes, sorry.

932
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:53,933
And that trophy?

933
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:57,270
We won
the volleyball tournament.

934
01:04:57,687 --> 01:04:59,605
The hot tub is working!

935
01:05:00,732 --> 01:05:02,107
And the AC.

936
01:05:02,317 --> 01:05:03,692
And we have hot water.

937
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,653
And you bought new jeans.

938
01:05:07,655 --> 01:05:10,198
Who are you and what
did you do with my husband?

939
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:11,283
Come here.

940
01:05:21,627 --> 01:05:23,128
How much was this?

941
01:05:24,338 --> 01:05:25,338
Very expensive.

942
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,173
-Alfredo...
-What?

943
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:29,718
We don't have to pay
anything else.

944
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:32,053
Cheers, baby.

945
01:05:32,555 --> 01:05:34,390
I remembered something.

946
01:05:35,725 --> 01:05:37,142
I like managing people.

947
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:39,603
The truth is you've always
been good at it.

948
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:43,857
The only thing I can't do
is saving the Russian.

949
01:05:47,487 --> 01:05:49,988
I have a plan,
although I'm not sure.

950
01:05:55,577 --> 01:05:56,912
You speak Russian?

951
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,667
I want to tell you

952
01:06:01,375 --> 01:06:05,838
that the world is a bear.

953
01:06:06,505 --> 01:06:07,798
The soup is cold.

954
01:06:09,342 --> 01:06:12,678
There are
many reasons for living.

955
01:06:14,597 --> 01:06:16,348
What did you say?

956
01:06:17,767 --> 01:06:19,143
Something huge.

957
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,232
I was in love...

958
01:06:27,985 --> 01:06:29,862
and she broke my heart

959
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:32,907
and now I can't keep living
anymore.

960
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:34,825
What did he say?

961
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:37,787
-Something about the heart.
-Is he sick?

962
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:43,125
I'd never seen such beauty.

963
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:46,795
Marry?

964
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:48,797
Marry...

965
01:06:49,132 --> 01:06:50,257
I think he likes you.

966
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:53,260
I told you we kissed,
but it was nothing.

967
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:56,763
Damn Russian,
you're in love with your ex

968
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:58,307
but you kissed my wife.

969
01:06:58,473 --> 01:07:00,392
You're one to talk!

970
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:01,935
You kissed Carmen.

971
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:05,063
I'm sorry but I didn't kiss her,
she kissed me.

972
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:06,773
But you didn't move away,
you could have.

973
01:07:06,857 --> 01:07:10,402
-María José, when you arrived...
-She was there...

974
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:12,738
You didn't see that she...

975
01:07:12,822 --> 01:07:14,198
The Russian!

976
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:22,873
I got you!

977
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:26,127
I got you! I got you!

978
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,753
It's slipping.

979
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:30,213
Damn Russian,
you're too heavy!

980
01:07:30,297 --> 01:07:32,425
-Don't let go!
-No!

981
01:07:36,137 --> 01:07:37,930
No!

982
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:43,352
Too bad,
we'll try again tomorrow.

983
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:48,607
-What?
-What happened?

984
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,692
Did he die?

985
01:07:49,775 --> 01:07:50,818
-Yes.
-What about me?

986
01:07:51,027 --> 01:07:53,112
You too,
but you're alive now.

987
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:54,238
Ah...!

988
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:58,992
Answer.

989
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:00,618
Hello?

990
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,332
Yes, mommy,
I'm wearing sunblock.

991
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:07,460
No, mommy,
I don't miss you because

992
01:08:07,543 --> 01:08:09,795
I feel like we've talked
for the past 100 days.

993
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,383
What are you doing today?

994
01:08:15,927 --> 01:08:17,678
I'm fixing the light,

995
01:08:17,803 --> 01:08:19,430
the water,

996
01:08:19,555 --> 01:08:21,265
and the hot tub.

997
01:08:21,932 --> 01:08:25,477
It'll take me like half an hour.
And you?

998
01:08:27,688 --> 01:08:29,440
There's one thing I want to do.

999
01:08:30,107 --> 01:08:31,150
A silly thing.

1000
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:39,908
Look, we know it's not easy.

1001
01:08:40,408 --> 01:08:43,745
And that you do it
to help out your families.

1002
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,542
Because you just said
that your heart is good,

1003
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,627
but have you ever considered

1004
01:08:51,003 --> 01:08:54,340
that there are better ways
to do it?

1005
01:08:55,925 --> 01:08:57,092
He's right.

1006
01:08:57,968 --> 01:08:59,135
-He's right.
-He is?

1007
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:00,345
Let's give them the money.

1008
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:03,598
Why don't we just give them
the money?

1009
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:04,808
And you...

1010
01:09:05,935 --> 01:09:08,020
Less apologies and more action.

1011
01:09:09,772 --> 01:09:10,772
MANAGEMENT

1012
01:09:10,857 --> 01:09:13,775
IGNACIO, TO KNOW THE WORLD
AND EVERYTHING IN IT

1013
01:09:23,077 --> 01:09:24,118
Carmen!

1014
01:09:24,453 --> 01:09:27,413
I know you've
always wanted this,

1015
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,500
how would you like to be
the new manager?

1016
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,960
Are you kidding?

1017
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:34,170
No, I'm serious! Really!

1018
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:08,747
And that was the exact moment
when I couldn't help but wonder,

1019
01:10:10,498 --> 01:10:13,043
do women really want

1020
01:10:14,753 --> 01:10:16,505
some prince charming?

1021
01:10:17,923 --> 01:10:19,383
What for?

1022
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,970
Or do we actually want someone

1023
01:10:25,932 --> 01:10:27,642
who makes us feel...

1024
01:10:29,727 --> 01:10:31,187
enormous!

1025
01:10:56,753 --> 01:11:00,757
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT
SEE YOU AT 7 P.M.

1026
01:12:27,887 --> 01:12:29,638
-Hi.
-Hi.

1027
01:12:29,847 --> 01:12:31,932
For my favorite guests.

1028
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,643
Who are these from?

1029
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:37,855
Cheers!

1030
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,192
-Have fun.
-Thanks.

1031
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:42,943
Cheers.

1032
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:44,445
I love you.

1033
01:12:46,197 --> 01:12:47,405
Hi.

1034
01:12:49,492 --> 01:12:50,492
How are you?

1035
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,508
Bravo!

1036
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:29,823
Let's go dance.

1037
01:13:33,202 --> 01:13:35,912
They really are a cute couple,
right, Bicho?

1038
01:13:36,037 --> 01:13:37,580
Yes, you look so in love.

1039
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:38,665
Thank you so much.

1040
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,917
How long
have you been together?

1041
01:13:41,293 --> 01:13:42,585
Twenty years.

1042
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:44,295
Plus two dating.

1043
01:13:44,797 --> 01:13:47,090
Twenty years, Bicho,
we can make it.

1044
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:48,883
Of course we can, my Bicha.

1045
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:50,385
How do you do...?

1046
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,722
We keep surprising each other.

1047
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,683
Bicho, surprise me!

1048
01:13:57,767 --> 01:13:59,853
I'll surprise you
my whole life, Bicha.

1049
01:14:11,157 --> 01:14:13,283
Hey, girl, that's a good song.

1050
01:14:44,438 --> 01:14:45,690
You know what, Alfredo?

1051
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,735
I think
we're fooling ourselves.

1052
01:14:49,862 --> 01:14:50,945
What do you mean?

1053
01:14:53,948 --> 01:14:56,785
I want you to make love
to me right now.

1054
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:00,955
Here?

1055
01:15:02,875 --> 01:15:04,668
People can see us.

1056
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:08,297
OK.

1057
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:10,632
They'll cheer us on.

1058
01:16:14,863 --> 01:16:17,157
I'm a little sore, that's weird.

1059
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:19,910
My foot no longer hurts.

1060
01:16:24,707 --> 01:16:25,915
I'm sore.

1061
01:16:28,127 --> 01:16:29,628
And my foot is OK?

1062
01:16:37,177 --> 01:16:38,387
I'm sore.

1063
01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:40,722
My foot no longer hurts.

1064
01:16:45,102 --> 01:16:46,102
Hello?

1065
01:16:46,185 --> 01:16:47,228
Hi!

1066
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:48,855
Hi...

1067
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:51,107
Nina, baby,
where's your grandma?

1068
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:52,192
She's asleep.

1069
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:54,568
I touched her last night
with my magic wand

1070
01:16:54,737 --> 01:16:57,363
and she watched
The Fire Lieutenant.

1071
01:17:01,702 --> 01:17:03,912
I'm sore.

1072
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,788
My foot no longer hurts.

1073
01:19:29,808 --> 01:19:31,602
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY

1074
01:19:44,155 --> 01:19:46,032
Dad, the accountant called.

1075
01:19:46,198 --> 01:19:48,410
Go get your
final paycheck on Monday.

1076
01:19:48,535 --> 01:19:51,120
Damn, dad...
I think you got fired.

1077
01:19:51,747 --> 01:19:52,997
I can work.

1078
01:19:53,582 --> 01:19:55,750
And I can stay here
and take care of the children.

1079
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:59,212
And I can go home
because it's getting late.

1080
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:01,590
-Good night.
-Bye, mom.

1081
01:20:05,385 --> 01:20:06,427
Thanks!

1082
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,265
Who
will help me with my things?

1083
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:12,350
I will!

1084
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,685
My bag, my suitcase.

1085
01:20:14,937 --> 01:20:15,937
Hey...

1086
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,983
I want a brother.

1087
01:21:40,272 --> 01:21:46,027
UNHAPPILY EVER AFTER
