1
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:25,401
Fate shuffles the cards.

2
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:41,000
But you play the game.

3
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:50,718
Chamber Chapters presents

4
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,674
My Name...doesn't really matter right now.

5
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,969
But believe me,
you will hear it soon enough!

6
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:45,309
What matters, is why I'm here.
Well, for one thing, to find out exactly that.

7
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:49,814
And for another, to play a game.
Poker!

8
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:55,611
This game has it all.
I love that moment when the cards are being dealt.

9
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,698
From this moment, everything is up to you.

10
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,909
In the wink of an eye, you can win it all.

11
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:05,788
Out of nowhere and just as soon,
you can lose it all!

12
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:11,294
The most important thing,
are the people who are playing with you.

13
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:47,663
The key to a successful game is
sizing up your opponents

14
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:50,666
and being able to predict their next moves.

15
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:55,963
What's their strategy?
How well can they hide their emotions?

16
00:04:56,172 --> 00:05:01,469
And, above all,
to what extent will their cards influence their game?

17
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,184
At the beginning of each game,
that's left to speculation.

18
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:12,897
That guy with the apple, for example,
seems to me to be the typical Bad-Ass!

19
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:18,903
That kind of man, who has a big mouth
and slapping your face if he doesn't like you!

20
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,073
But I don't think he's for real.

21
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,576
When it comes to the crunch,
he will piss off!

22
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:29,830
As they say,
barking dogs never bite!

23
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,668
Now the baldy, on the other hand,
is harder to pin down.

24
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:40,841
More of an introverted type. His posture is like
a Scaredy Cat, almost fearful!

25
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,179
Still, there's something about him
that I can't quite put my finger on.

26
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:49,433
And then, there's her.
The beautiful stranger!

27
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:53,562
I have to admit it,
I have an issue with women playing poker.

28
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:57,358
Don't get me wrong.
I'm no sexist or anything!

29
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:02,530
I'm just trying to be cautious!

30
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:07,034
Because her character is hard to weigh up.

31
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:12,790
I mean, she doesn't exactly strike me
as the innocent type,

32
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:17,878
but what does that tell me?
Just that I need to be careful!

33
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,524
The moment is here!

34
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:44,155
All players have been dealt their hands.
Now they can make their bets!

35
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:14,477
The cards have been dealt, the bets have been made.
Now the game can begin!

36
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:19,774
The Salesman

37
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:25,654
The Cop

38
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:31,827
The Unknown

39
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:38,167
The Accomplice

40
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,318
What's up with that fucking bag?
Holidays?

41
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,820
Yeah.
Gonna hide for a few days.

42
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:36,076
Good idea. After all we
did during the last months!

43
00:09:39,163 --> 00:09:46,378
Shit! Reminds me of my ex-girlfriend. She always
said we should spend our vacation together.

44
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,422
So?

45
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:53,469
We never did.
In the end, she was a pain in the ass!

46
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:57,097
Would have been the worst
fucking holiday of my life!

47
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:07,835
Here is the deal:
Me and Mr. Unknown will meet alone.

48
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:13,382
Mr. Unknown doesn't know you're here.
So you wait here.

49
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:18,637
If I'm not back in 15 minutes,
come on in...

50
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,307
...and save my ass!

51
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,143
Alright!

52
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,722
My name is Ben Borgmann.

53
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:08,228
I was... let's say a problem solver,
if you know what I'm talking about!

54
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:13,067
People called me when they
did not want to get their hands dirty.

55
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:20,157
But life goes on...and when you do something
for too long you start asking yourself- why?

56
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:25,037
I had no answer to it and that is
why I decided to back out.

57
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:30,626
As you can imagine I need money...
a lot of money to do that!

58
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:42,429
If my plan works out, my partner will return
in a few minutes with a suitcase full of cash.

59
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:48,644
This will be my ticket for a new life.
He is the only one who stands in my way.

60
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:53,190
On our way back home, I'll give him
a fucking bullet to the head...

61
00:12:53,524 --> 00:13:00,406
...drive to the airport, get on the plane and
be gone before anyone notices what happened!

62
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:18,794
Hm, I must say,
the location looks great!

63
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,587
I'm glad you like it.

64
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:23,257
I will choose better clothes
for the next time!

65
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,134
What would it bring?

66
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,470
Well,
clothes make the man!

67
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,764
I'd say that does
not always fit!

68
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,894
You remind me of my ex.
She used to talk shit like that!

69
00:15:36,687 --> 00:15:38,564
I guess that's why
she left you!

70
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:42,693
You have a pretty big mouth!
But I got it!

71
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:46,029
You are just trying to impress me,
but I tell ya...

72
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:50,450
Do me a favor!
Let's just do our business...

73
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,954
And then,
let's see what happens!

74
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:58,166
Was just testing you!
So let's see what you got for me.

75
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,093
Shit, are you crazy!?

76
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:51,428
Is anybody else here?

77
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:53,847
Take that gun down, bitch!

78
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,433
Just answer my question!

79
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,478
It's just you and me!
Take down the gun!

80
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,854
Raise your hands!

81
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,481
Ok there are up...see?

82
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:06,443
Now turn around and put your gun
on the table!

83
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,403
I don't have a fucking gun!

84
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:12,199
Ok, calm down...
calm down!

85
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,121
I drop my gun!

86
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,962
Ok...get over here now
and sit down!

87
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:32,344
So what? Is this supposed to be some
kind of a fucking interrogation or what...?

88
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,340
Throw the gun away!
Raise your hands!

89
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:55,218
Throw the gun away!
You hear me?

90
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:56,386
Who are you?

91
00:18:56,595 --> 00:19:03,059
I'm a cop! So it's better when you...
just do what I say!

92
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,062
Put the gun on the floor!

93
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:12,611
Ok, I got it. If you're a cop
you're about to make a mistake...

94
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:16,198
Shut the fuck up
and put down the fucking gun!

95
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,127
Stay there and don't move!

96
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,011
Stay calm!

97
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:30,981
Turn around, put down the suitcases and gun,
then go back into the hall!

98
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,233
Got that?

99
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,856
Ok, stop!

100
00:21:16,026 --> 00:21:18,486
Cross your arms behind your back.

101
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,989
I don't know who you are, but...

102
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:25,076
It don't matter who I am!
And I don't care who you are!

103
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:31,249
Here are two dead bodies and it wouldn't make
much sense to ask you that happened!

104
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,084
So just shut up!

105
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:35,921
In that suitcase...

106
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:42,135
I know what's in there.
The suitcase isn't the problem.

107
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,137
You are the problem!

108
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,641
Don't make it worse!

109
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:58,485
Walk slowly down the hall, arms behind your back,
and don't turn around.

110
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,528
Got that?

111
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:06,076
Ok. Go!

112
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:12,684
In the first round, it has much to do with the cards in your hand,
whether you win or lose.

113
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,062
Cause you don't know the tactics
of your opponents.

114
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,240
I had a good hand,
and my tactics worked.

115
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:17,123
I kept a low profile. I was patient,
observed and slammed at the right moment.

116
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:22,587
I benefited from the fact that the two guys
took each other out of the game.

117
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:27,008
The guy with the apple has more or less
stayed true to my first impression.

118
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:32,347
A Bad Ass with macho affectations
who's talking shit even if no one listens.

119
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,934
One thing I was wrong about, though.

120
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:42,941
When I already thought he was out of the game
and completely out of the blue,

121
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:47,862
he was back with a vengeance
and came out on top for a while.

122
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:51,866
A property that makes him dangerous.

123
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:56,287
Because I think he will go very far
to get what he wants!

124
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:03,753
The baldie, on the other hand,
has revealed himself to me in the first round already.

125
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:10,218
A strictly systematic player,
always sticking to his plan.

126
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:17,892
But that's not how this game works.
You can't play by the book. Just as life doesn't follow rules.

127
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:23,731
Only one move can destroy everything!
And then?

128
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:31,114
You have to improvise, adapt to the situation.
Stay in control and try to outplay your opponents.

129
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:33,825
He didn't do any of this!

130
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,497
In the end, I only played against her,
the beautiful stranger.

131
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:46,713
I had the chance to finish the game,
but for some reason I let her go on.

132
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:53,511
I can't tell you why.
But I know that I have to find out exactly that.

133
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,848
What would she have done in my place?

134
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:02,479
Would she have given me a chance —
or taken me out, stone cold?

135
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:06,649
That is one of the key questions in this whole game.

136
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:12,322
Before we go on,
a quick recap on what's happened so far.

137
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:16,451
The stranger is in the warehouse,
waiting for the salesman.

138
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,412
The salesman shows up,
together with his accomplice.

139
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:24,626
He enters, the accomplice waits outside and
goes into action whenever there are problems.

140
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,879
But what about the cop?

141
00:26:56,366 --> 00:27:02,413
The cards have been shuffled and dealt.
Another chance, another bet.

142
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:32,110
The bets have been made.
I've been dealt a new hand.

143
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:34,445
Let a new round begin!

144
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:42,036
The stranger

145
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:47,750
The salesman

146
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:53,381
The accomplice

147
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:59,512
The cop

148
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:32,420
The cop

149
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:05,203
My name is Ben Borgmann.
I'm a cop.

150
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:09,165
It's important to be concerned about the details,

151
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:12,126
no matter how small or unimpressive
they appear to be.

152
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:15,713
You have to try to be a step ahead!

153
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:19,258
A few days ago I discovered such a detail.

154
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:24,472
The hint wasn't sufficient for my boss
to induce an observation.

155
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:30,728
But a smart cop has to trust in his intuition
and go his own way.

156
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,940
And that's exactly what
I'm doing right now!

157
00:33:41,354 --> 00:33:44,857
Shit! You're late!

158
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:51,113
Look at this apple.
I started eating when I came in!

159
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:55,034
Can we begin?

160
00:33:55,242 --> 00:34:00,831
I don't like people who are late.
Reminds me of my ex, you know?

161
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:04,418
No matter what time we had agreed,
she always came too late.

162
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:08,965
Once I told her specially the wrong time...
but she came too late again!

163
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:14,261
Would you please stop talking,
I don't care!

164
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:21,185
The deal was to meet you here at 9:30pm.
It's 9:31pm and 15 seconds right now.

165
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:30,236
I walked through the door at 9:30pm.
That means I was absolutely right on time!

166
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:39,870
So...here are the goodies. Check it.
I will check the money. Undisturbed!

167
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,832
Did you understand that?

168
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:48,379
Calm down man! I don't like it
when someone talk to me like that!

169
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:52,883
That's not my style.
So fuck you and take care!

170
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:55,970
Did you understand that!?

171
00:34:57,263 --> 00:35:05,021
I just want to check the money...
so what's your problem?

172
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,315
I just wanted to test you.

173
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:13,821
Count your money boy!

174
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,969
Who the fuck are you?

175
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:22,848
Just shut up and raise your hands!
I'm a cop.

176
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:27,561
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and so on...

177
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,355
You're making a big mistake...

178
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,065
Raise your hands!

179
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:32,566
I'm not the person you think...

180
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:36,987
Shut the fuck up!
Don't say a word and just shut up!

181
00:36:37,196 --> 00:36:38,781
Listen to the baldy!

182
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,809
Who is Mira?

183
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:34,021
Mira?...my girlfriend.

184
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:39,235
She's not a part of this!

185
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,740
Yeah, sure!

186
00:38:46,116 --> 00:38:49,995
Talk to her and tell her
that everything is working out.

187
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,797
She wants to talk to you!

188
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:08,347
Don't move,
don't turn around or...

189
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,813
A Browning is aimed right
at your handsome head.

190
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,775
I guess I have your full attention!

191
00:39:19,984 --> 00:39:25,406
Listen to me closely, do exactly
as I tell you and everything will be ok!

192
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:29,743
Take the magazine from your gun
and put it down. Slowly!

193
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:49,847
Nice. And now take your phone
and throw it far away.

194
00:39:57,771 --> 00:40:00,274
Just one more little thing and we're done!

195
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:02,151
I think I know what's next!

196
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:09,074
I'm pleased by men who pay attention!
Lay down on the ground and cross hands behind your back.

197
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:52,803
Fuck...Shit!

198
00:41:56,765 --> 00:42:01,645
It's me! I need support! Urgently!

199
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:07,568
We can work that out later.
Now move your damn ass right here!

200
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,097
Hey cop!

201
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:42,311
Looks like we have a new player on board!

202
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:45,981
We should work together to get out of here!

203
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:50,694
We are playing in the same team!
Got that?

204
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,663
Fuck...damned!

205
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:38,283
I am here! Stop and show yourself!

206
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:46,667
Put the gun down!

207
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:50,629
Put the gun down!

208
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:56,385
Erik, come here!
Believe me, he won't kill you.

209
00:43:56,385 --> 00:44:00,973
Erik, don't listen to her. I will shoot.
Stay where you are!

210
00:44:01,515 --> 00:44:05,644
He bluffs...come here now!

211
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,772
Ok. I'm coming.

212
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,107
Eric, stay where you are!

213
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:11,275
Come here now!

214
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:16,321
Don't shoot!

215
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:26,623
Stop!

216
00:44:26,623 --> 00:44:27,582
What?

217
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:29,126
Stop and turn around!

218
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:30,752
What's that all about, Mira?

219
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,504
Turn around!

220
00:44:52,274 --> 00:44:54,985
Give me the suitcase with the money
or I will kill him!

221
00:44:55,193 --> 00:45:00,532
You fuckin' bitch!
You will pay for this! You will...

222
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:03,619
I'm waiting!

223
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:10,709
You really think I'd mind if you shoot him?

224
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:14,046
Are you kidding me?
You're a cop!

225
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:18,800
Exactly! And I don't think you want to
have one more dead guy on your list!

226
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:25,974
And it looks like you're on your own.
No partner, no support?

227
00:45:26,183 --> 00:45:28,226
Don't make it even worse!

228
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:37,194
Don't worry. I won't!

229
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:54,563
What do you do?
The bitch will escape!

230
00:46:55,564 --> 00:46:58,650
Don't worry,
she's not going to get far!

231
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:01,153
Get up!

232
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:26,094
I started with good cards in my hand,
but I can't say it was a good round.

233
00:47:26,762 --> 00:47:32,142
It was pretty chaotic and difficult to keep control.

234
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:36,188
I wouldn't exactly call myself
the winner of that round,

235
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:41,651
but all that counts is the hand
you have at the end!

236
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:32,536
I changed my tactics.

237
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:37,374
Instead of playing safe, I used the first
chance I got, to attack my opponents.

238
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:41,920
When everything went haywire,
I adapted to the situation,

239
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:45,382
kept cool and improvised.

240
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:53,682
The baldy followed his method.

241
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:57,727
He was insecure, helpless
and without control.

242
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:03,191
If something happening, that's not planned,
he is losing the overview of the game...

243
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,613
...and tries to adapt to his opponents.
But like I said, it doesn't work like that.

244
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:13,326
I wonder if he even knows
how the game works.

245
00:49:13,869 --> 00:49:17,372
But the question is — does it matter?

246
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:33,305
The Bad Ass followed his method too.

247
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:36,933
But I'm beginning to think
that that's exactly his style!

248
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:44,357
He just tries to confuse his opponents,
to get control!

249
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:50,614
But in the middle of the game,
he was trying to warn to me.

250
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:55,702
I think he knows more than he admits.

251
00:49:56,786 --> 00:50:02,083
I have to ask myself,
what if I would listen to him?

252
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:18,224
Last but not least, it was all about her again.

253
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:24,773
This time she had a very strong hand,
enough potential to show her aggressive and radical side.

254
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:30,695
I had another chance to finish the game,
but I let her go on again.

255
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,491
And, again, I ask myself why?

256
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:40,956
I feel attracted to her
and want to help her.

257
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:45,293
Maybe that's the answer and reason,
why I'm here!

258
00:51:52,902 --> 00:52:02,454
The Unknown

259
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,206
My name is Ben Borgmann.

260
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:32,418
I work as an undercover agent,
for seven months.

261
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:37,507
It took me long to enter one
of the most important syndicates.

262
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:41,594
And even longer to get a chance.

263
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:46,474
The possibility has come.
That's my chance!

264
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:49,310
The goal of my work!

265
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:54,440
If I get this deal done,
I'm in the top league.

266
00:53:55,984 --> 00:53:59,863
In my position discretion is the most important thing.

267
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:03,324
Only my boss knows who and where I am.

268
00:54:03,575 --> 00:54:07,662
I will do my very best to keep it that way!

269
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:38,234
Do you have what I want?

270
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:42,155
I have what we had agreed!

271
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:45,700
We agreed to come alone!

272
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:51,414
I stick to agreements.
So take a look around.

273
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:55,084
I like what I see!

274
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:12,226
You seem self confident!

275
00:55:12,769 --> 00:55:15,480
I just want to know who I am dealing with.

276
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:19,150
Then, let's go back to business!

277
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:21,736
You can start!

278
00:56:08,658 --> 00:56:10,994
Don't move and
raise your hands!

279
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:15,415
Stop moving!

280
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,001
Keep calm!
Who are you?

281
00:56:18,209 --> 00:56:23,715
I'm a cop! You have the right to shut up...
blablabla...you're arrested!

282
00:56:24,007 --> 00:56:28,845
You, throw your guns away...now!

283
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:33,766
Ok, you're a cop.
Believe me, you're making a big mistake!

284
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:37,562
Stay there and shut the fuck up!

285
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:41,232
I'm not the one you think I am!

286
00:56:48,614 --> 00:56:53,161
Take my phone from my left pocket, slowly!

287
00:56:53,369 --> 00:56:56,956
If you call the police,
everything was for nothing!

288
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:59,167
Take the damn phone!

289
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:01,127
You got to listen to me!

290
00:57:01,336 --> 00:57:03,379
I don't give a fuck.
Take the phone!

291
00:57:03,588 --> 00:57:09,886
I am a cop...just like you!
My cover will blown if you call the police!

292
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:13,139
Redial...now!

293
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:15,558
It's true, we're on the same side!

294
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:17,852
Stop talking shit and
shut the fuck up!

295
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:22,899
Take my phone, call my boss,
he will confirm, I'm a cop...

296
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:19,348
What's that supposed to be?
It's not my fault, that you killed the guy.

297
00:59:19,557 --> 00:59:25,021
I don't give a shit who or what you are.

298
00:59:25,271 --> 00:59:27,398
I just want to finish my job!

299
00:59:28,107 --> 00:59:32,069
The guy stood in our way.

300
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:34,906
You did the right thing!

301
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:40,620
Yes...you're right.

302
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:44,957
And it's still possible to turn the page!

303
00:59:45,166 --> 00:59:51,297
We can leave this place as winners!
With our suitcases.

304
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:53,799
As if nothing had happened!

305
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,553
We just have to take care of the dead guy!

306
00:59:58,012 --> 01:00:02,975
Exactly... you will help me to get him outside.
Alright?

307
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:03,893
Alright!

308
01:00:03,893 --> 01:00:04,685
Ok!

309
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:13,778
Take his leg.

310
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,795
Put the gun down!

311
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:35,925
What the hell is going on here?
What happened?

312
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,556
We can still make it!
We just have to work together.

313
01:00:41,556 --> 01:00:43,599
Shut up and put the gun down!

314
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,477
What can we accomplish?

315
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:53,859
We can win. I deliver the goods,
you get the money. Just as planned.

316
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:59,740
Nothing works as planned!
Shut up and put the gun down now!

317
01:00:59,949 --> 01:01:00,866
It's ok!

318
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:03,327
We just have to do it together.

319
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:06,831
We can't!

320
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:08,040
What?

321
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,460
Everyone here stands alone!

322
01:01:11,919 --> 01:01:17,508
Every one of us plays by his own rules.
You did, he did, I will too.

323
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:21,387
But we're both responsible for this!

324
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:24,056
No!

325
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:25,891
You are responsible for this!

326
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:46,746
What the fuck is going on?

327
01:01:46,954 --> 01:01:49,665
Who is that guy?
And who is the dead guy?

328
01:01:49,665 --> 01:01:51,959
Calm down, I'll explain later.

329
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:54,795
Is this the suitcase with the money?

330
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:07,767
If you'd be in my position,
would you collaborate?

331
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:11,979
Would you help me? Or set me free?

332
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,600
The Answer would have been yes!

333
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:55,898
Yes, I would have helped her.
Yes, I would have let her get away.

334
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:59,985
But she will never get to know the answer!

335
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:10,621
Because no matter which cards I would have had,
I would always have underestimated him!

336
01:03:24,093 --> 01:03:28,722
He won the game!
The game where only one player can win.

337
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:31,934
But this time it isn't a game!

338
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:34,687
No round been followed by a next one!

339
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:38,566
No new cards been shuffled and dealt!

340
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:42,403
Because this time, it's reality!

341
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:37,750
My name is Ben Borgman.

342
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:44,256
But I am not an accomplice, waiting in front of the warehouse,
ready to snatch the money to start a new life.

343
01:04:45,132 --> 01:04:49,637
And I am also not a cop, who's doing a one man show
to arrest everyone who is involved.

344
01:04:50,471 --> 01:04:57,811
And I can't even tell you, that those are the real reasons
why everybody is here or why they act the way they do.

345
01:04:58,229 --> 01:05:01,649
It's just that this way, it makes scenes to me!

346
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:21,085
I am an undercover agent.

347
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:25,589
Unfortunately that part of the story
is sadly true!

348
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:29,176
Because I lost the game!

349
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:32,346
I missed my own rules.

350
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:38,894
I didn't keep the control and
misjudged my opponents.

351
01:05:40,104 --> 01:05:42,982
In the end,
it's all about that!

352
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:50,739
In the reality, you can only play once!
Only with your own cards!

353
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:04,878
Actually there's another round to play.
the salesman!

354
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:10,301
But I think, my time is running out.

355
01:06:10,885 --> 01:06:12,678
So I ask you.

356
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:17,683
How would you play this game?

357
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:21,854
Would you wait and see?
Or just playing...
