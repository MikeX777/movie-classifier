1
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:25,761
Big Al has a huge cock.

2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,316
I'm serious. I'm not fucking with you.

3
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:32,197
Thing... thing is humongous.
Okay, it's like-

4
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,049
Looks like it's got little arms
and legs and shit. Looks alive

5
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,668
Like I could put it over my shoulder
and burp it, know what I'm saying?

6
00:00:38,669 --> 00:00:41,304
It's like a plumbing tool or something.
The first time I saw it...

7
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:42,406
I was like: "Put that thing away.

8
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:44,568
You ain't coming near
me with that monster."

9
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:46,984
But you know Big Al, you know...

10
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,820
He just kept coming at me.

11
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:52,665
Y'know he, he looks at me and he says:

12
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:56,752
Hey, you think you can handle that?

13
00:00:56,753 --> 00:00:59,057
Huh? Think you can? Huh?

14
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:01,532
I mean...

15
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:05,048
It was like...

16
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:08,485
I mean look, I'm competitive, right?

17
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:11,514
I was, I was in competitive
gymnastics in high school.

18
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:15,448
So, y'know, I took another look at it.

19
00:01:15,787 --> 00:01:21,121
And I was like: well, I could
have a hell of a time trying.

20
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,042
You know?

21
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:26,011
I mean, we had great sex.

22
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:29,048
Y'know, I'm talking about
'tie me up to the bedpost...

23
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:31,789
with your dirty sweatsocks'
sex, you know what I'm saying?

24
00:01:31,932 --> 00:01:34,907
You know. Big Al

25
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:37,819
's king of the neighborhood.

26
00:01:38,742 --> 00:01:42,662
Look, you can say what you want about
him, Big Al is a great fuck.

27
00:03:16,245 --> 00:03:17,874
Al, what's up?

28
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,843
Sing it.

29
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:22,142
Hey listen, I got some...

30
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:25,785
new toasters and some track
suits back at the house.

31
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:27,514
Sign me up.

32
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:30,072
- Where the fuck is Reilly?
- Haven't seen him.

33
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:37,764
Whoa, careful there, baby.

34
00:03:45,112 --> 00:03:46,748
Hey, baby.

35
00:03:50,254 --> 00:03:53,185
- Hey, Sarge.
- Where is he?

36
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:56,714
Over there.

37
00:03:58,974 --> 00:04:00,644
That mope?

38
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:05,642
- I thought I told you no mopes.
- You said you wanted customers.
I got you customers, all right?

39
00:04:05,643 --> 00:04:08,443
Don't worry about it. He's clean.
Snssn checked him out.

40
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,537
Go make us some money.

41
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:17,954
Wait here, okay?

42
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:29,534
How you doing?

43
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:31,977
Alright.

44
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:34,042
Hey, where you from?

45
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:36,161
- Long Island.
- Really?

46
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:38,222
What can I do for you?

47
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:40,538
I want a gun.

48
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,642
What are you, a fucking asshole?

49
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:47,638
You wanna say that a little fucking louder? You wanna
broadcast it around the island with the fucking news?

50
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:49,683
- Sorry.
- Huh?

51
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:53,145
Where on the Island?

52
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:55,360
Ice Peak.

53
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:58,902
- Islanders or Rangers?
- What?

54
00:04:58,903 --> 00:05:02,803
The Islanders or the fucking Rangers.
What are you, a fucking moron?

55
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,783
Rangers.

56
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:08,393
- Rangers?
- Yes.

57
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,315
Is this a fucking interview??

58
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,958
I just want my 45.

59
00:05:18,205 --> 00:05:19,405
Stop!

60
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:21,628
Liar!

61
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:25,449
- Enough!
- Fuck you!

62
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,574
- What is it?
- He's clean.

63
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:29,162
You got no guns.

64
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,222
- You came in too early.
- Too fucking early?

65
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:32,685
That's right.

66
00:05:32,686 --> 00:05:35,967
- You fucking knew what you were supposed to do.
- I did what I was supposed to do.

67
00:05:37,593 --> 00:05:40,279
Hey, you got this? Huh?

68
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,150
Now get your fuckin hands off
my fuckin dick and get out of here

69
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:45,830
Before I fuckin file a harassment suit, you

70
00:05:45,832 --> 00:05:49,055
Fucking fag
bisexual fucking Village People.

71
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:50,762
Get the fuck outta here.
Get outta my bar.

00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:53,690
- Motherfucker!

00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:55,602
We'll fucking get you!

00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:08,092
You're hot, Baby.

78
00:06:08,093 --> 00:06:10,059
- Yeah?
- Sexy.

79
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,957
Let's Get Away resolve an issue.

80
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:18,551
Big Al

81
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:20,291
He was always trouble.

82
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,912
Ever since he was born.

83
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:24,683
Motherfucker! Fucking how?

84
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,916
- What did I do?
- I thought you said you and__ had him checked out!

85
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:31,468
- We did have him checked out.
- What, together, you in on the set up or something?

86
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:36,077
C-section, y'know. 48 hours of labor.

87
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:40,171
Fucking kid!
He was never no good!

88
00:06:40,172 --> 00:06:41,961
I shoulda never had him.

89
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:44,640
You can't fuckin run an
organization like this, ok?

90
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:46,387
It's sloppy.
It's for amateurs.

91
00:06:46,388 --> 00:06:48,808
You gotta... you gotta
plan these things right.

92
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,175
What organization are
you talking about, Al?

93
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:53,902
He never comes home for the holidays.
I mean, it's Thanksgiving, y'know,

94
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:56,534
But you're not gonna find him here. No.

95
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:01,199
No sense of family.
No sense of loyalty.

96
00:07:02,437 --> 00:07:06,521
I, I don't know what... I don't know
what went wrong with him. I...

97
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:11,884
I didn't smoke during my pregnancy.
I didn't drink, y'know. Not a drop.

98
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:14,394
Beer and wine, but that's okay.

99
00:07:14,395 --> 00:07:16,999
I'm sick and tired of it, God!

100
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:19,788
Hey! What are you doing?

101
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,636
I'm fucking taking a piss.
Get the fuck off!

102
00:07:21,637 --> 00:07:25,749
You fuck off. You promised me
you'd get me out of this neighborhood!

103
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,625
Alright?

104
00:07:26,626 --> 00:07:30,662
Seaside Heights, or Rockway, or Ocean City or
something. Look at you pissing on the fucking wall!

105
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:32,370
Fuck off!

106
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:34,217
I want to see the real world.

107
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:35,982
- The real world.
- I'm tired of this shit!

108
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:40,042
What fucking real world?
You got the whole fucking world right here!

109
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:45,830
Aaah Jesus fucking cunt!

110
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:52,717
Okay, you assholes!
Get in here, dinner's ready!

111
00:08:02,546 --> 00:08:05,775
Excuse me, but I just hate
Thanksgiving.

112
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:11,953
No, I didn't raise a murderer.
No, the streets did.

113
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,055
Stop it! Stop!

114
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:39,108
My fucking TV! Hey!

115
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:41,597
- Motherfucker, come here
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

116
00:08:41,598 --> 00:08:43,465
No! Our TV!

117
00:08:47,869 --> 00:08:50,033
Al, Our new TV!

118
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,230
Motherfucker!

119
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,263
You knocked the guy out.

120
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:57,946
I don't care about him. Look what
he did to the fucking TV!

121
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,333
Did you have to do that, sir?

122
00:09:00,334 --> 00:09:01,862
- I'm Sorry.
- Fuck!

123
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:04,230
Call the cops, c'mon!

124
00:09:06,528 --> 00:09:10,517
You Americans are so violent.
I was just trying to rob you.

125
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,875
I don't fucking believe you!

126
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:16,798
537 West 39th Street. We have an
emergency. There's a thief in the house.

127
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,742
Will ya get off the fucking carpet!

128
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:22,829
It's a Persian original. It's expensive!

129
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,104
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

130
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:27,143
I will not come back again. Sorry.

131
00:09:27,144 --> 00:09:30,463
Get off my fucking carpet!

132
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:33,820
I'm sorry, please don't kill me.
I'm sorry, please.

133
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,528
Please, I'm so sorry.

134
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,704
No wonder you couldn't
fit through the fucking window.

135
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:40,279
Look at the size of your ass!

136
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,301
Look at that thing, it looks like
a fucking parking lot.

137
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:46,923
You need to start jogging, you
fucking piece of shit!

138
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:48,590
Please!

139
00:09:48,591 --> 00:09:49,835
I hope you got
you're green card.

140
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:51,030
Please let me go.

141
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:53,234
Punjabi or what the
fuck ever you are.

142
00:09:53,235 --> 00:09:54,544
I'm so sorry!

143
00:09:54,545 --> 00:09:57,000
You make me sick, you understand?
You make me fucking sick!

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,503
- I am sorry I broke your TV.
- You fucks, you come over here,

145
00:10:00,504 --> 00:10:06,011
take our jobs and then...
You're fucking parasites. You disgust me.

146
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:07,614
What the fuck is going on
with this country?

147
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:12,713
What the fuck is happening
to this fucking country!?

148
00:10:12,714 --> 00:10:15,402
You know what's wrong with
this fucking country?

149
00:10:15,403 --> 00:10:17,553
No, we're...
We're being robbed.

150
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:20,663
I'm sorry, please
just let me go!

151
00:10:20,762 --> 00:10:23,354
I have a family and the bus.

152
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:25,546
A bus? You got a fucking
bus downstairs?

153
00:10:25,547 --> 00:10:28,756
I'll take the fucking bus. You want
the fucking TV, I'll take your fucking bus!

154
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:31,592
Ok? Number 6, number 9...

155
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:33,592
Don't y... don't fucking be clever with me.

156
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:35,817
I was lying.

157
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:38,337
That's fucking mine.
It's my shit.

158
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,912
- Fucking don't touch it!
- I don't really have a bus,

159
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:43,147
But please, let me go!

160
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:48,026
Al, I'll take two of the toasters.

161
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:50,635
And the blue navy suit.

162
00:10:50,636 --> 00:10:53,290
42 regular cause my nephew's
coming into town.

163
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,240
- And three cartons of menthol.
- Alright.

164
00:10:56,418 --> 00:10:59,102
- Al
- Yes.

165
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:01,653
It's not my fault. I came
to the wrong address.

166
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:05,068
- What happened here?
- I caught the fuck trying to rob me.

167
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:11,572
Lady, please. This crazy he's going
to kill me and his girlfriend is...

168
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:14,188
What are you doing?
Stop it! I'm in pain!

169
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:16,520
- Marge, you like these for the nephew?
- Yeah, those are nice.

170
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:19,255
- These are on the house, okay?
- Oh, yeah, nice.

171
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:21,854
So, uh...

172
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:24,651
- Cash or credit card?
- Cash.

173
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:28,065
Unless you have some of
those nice "hot" cards.

174
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:32,568
I might. I might. But you got
something for me, huh?

175
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:35,800
Fuck all of you!

176
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:40,728
Big Al, y'know, his troubles started
when my husband and I broke up.

177
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:43,902
He was Scottish
A big fucking boozer!

178
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,187
And he took Al
to Scotland, you know?

179
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:49,842
And when he came back, he
was tougher and meaner.

180
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,822
And he never lost
that accent either.

181
00:11:57,913 --> 00:11:59,935
Move to the right.

182
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:04,941
No, that's left.

183
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:12,786
What the fuck's going on?

184
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:15,041
He's, uh, he's in the toilet.
Arrest him.

185
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:17,101
- Who is?
- The thief!

186
00:12:17,102 --> 00:12:19,053
- Hey, What the fuck are you doing?
- Hey!

187
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:22,697
What the fuck?

188
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:25,543
- What is this, a fucking joke?
- Are you a joke?

189
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:28,183
- Should I call the cops again?
- It's no fucking joke, ok?

190
00:12:28,184 --> 00:12:30,080
I found you a real
fucking criminal.

191
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:32,614
I'm sick and tired of
doing your fucking job, okay?

192
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:35,502
He's in the fucking
toilet. Open the door!

193
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:38,400
Police! Thank god you're here!
Oh please, help me!

194
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:41,382
This guy, he's got drugs
all over the house!

195
00:12:41,383 --> 00:12:44,000
Fuckin' joke.

196
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:47,911
Hey, joker! You piece of shit.
They don't have a warrant!

197
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:51,623
Why don't you read the Constitution
of the United States of America

198
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:55,016
And you guys, hey.

199
00:12:55,017 --> 00:12:57,825
Come on, get this fucking guy
outta my house

200
00:12:57,826 --> 00:13:00,703
before I tell your supervisor
you're harassing me.

201
00:13:00,704 --> 00:13:03,584
Man, fuck Big Al! Big Al, everybody's
I ain't scared of Big Al, man, fuck,

202
00:13:03,585 --> 00:13:05,868
Bring his ass over here,
I ain't scared of that motherfucker

203
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,880
I'll fuck his ass up
right here, right now, man

204
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:09,458
Man, fuck his ass. I never liked him.

205
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,395
And you know what? He never liked
my Puerto Rican ass anyway.

206
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:13,824
You know what, let's keep it that way!
Did I do this to him?

207
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:17,708
Hell no, man. That nigga's small time,
yo, I'm big time!

208
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,393
Fuck that motherfucker!

209
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:23,127
Fuck that motherfucker!

210
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:26,309
Alright, what about me, huh?
What about my needs?

211
00:13:26,344 --> 00:13:28,151
- What?
- Yeah, my needs.

212
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:30,108
Eat me.

213
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:32,491
- I eat you good.
- Oh, you call that eating?

214
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:34,751
Yeah, you know what I call that?
I call that tasting.

215
00:13:34,752 --> 00:13:37,533
I call that fucking munching. Alright?

216
00:13:37,535 --> 00:13:41,313
I been eaten by mosquitoes better than that.
I've been bitten by bedbugs with more bite.

217
00:13:41,314 --> 00:13:44,603
Alright, how come you're
selling a gun behind my back, hmm?

218
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:47,955
- What are you talking about?
- Oh yeah, okay.

219
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:51,290
So you don't think that I know about
that fucking tattooed fuck?

220
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:52,198
Clancy told me.

221
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:54,920
How come you're doing fucking
deals behind my back?

222
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:57,486
What? He needed a fucking gun.
What was I supposed to do?

223
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:59,270
Blow the deal or something?
I got you your money.

224
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,302
- How much?
- Same as always.

225
00:14:02,294 --> 00:14:05,754
There's four $100 bills in
your underwear drawer, okay?

226
00:14:05,755 --> 00:14:06,821
Next to the downs.

227
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:10,086
- You're not trying to sell me out here?
- Alright, just take a look, for God's sakes.

228
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:13,542
You're not fucking that Clancy
motherfucker, y'know

229
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:16,384
- You don't think I see the way you look at him?
- Gimme a break. I sleep with one fucking guy, alright?

230
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:17,564
Stop talking shit.

231
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:20,867
First of all, I hear on the fucking
street you're selling guns behind my back

232
00:14:20,868 --> 00:14:23,408
So then I come home,
and you don't fucking tell me

233
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,512
- And then I want you to suck my cock,
- Shut the fuck up!

234
00:14:25,513 --> 00:14:28,413
- And you won't even fucking do
- Shut the fuck up!

235
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:31,837
Who fucking told you?

236
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:33,664
Hellen.

237
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:35,201
Son of a bitch!

238
00:14:36,386 --> 00:14:38,273
Motherfucker.

239
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:40,706
Goddamn men, y'know

240
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:42,186
Big Al thinks the worst thing

241
00:14:42,188 --> 00:14:43,936
you can do is
sleep with another guy, right?

242
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:46,264
Let another guy fuck you

243
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:49,516
Oh yeah? But it's okay for him
to fuck other girls, right?

244
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:51,180
He did it all the time.

245
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:54,476
It's a double standard, right?

246
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:57,055
But only on his side.

247
00:14:57,056 --> 00:14:59,078
Yeah, well that don't fly with me, y'know?

248
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:00,907
I... y'know what? I just don't get it.

249
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:03,733
I don't get why, why guys think
they're the ones that are getting over.

250
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:07,208
Y'know, why they think they're the ones
doing the fucking. Alright?

251
00:15:08,177 --> 00:15:09,883
'Cause, y'know, when I sleep with a guy.

252
00:15:09,884 --> 00:15:12,886
I make sure he knows
who's fucking whom.

253
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:16,556
And I stick my finger up his
ass just so he knows it.

254
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:20,762
You didn't sell Clancy the .45
with the two tone stainless, did you?

255
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:22,858
- Huh? What?
- The .45.

256
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:26,910
No. I'm not an idiot. I
know that's your gun.

257
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,698
It's the only one I have
that's legally registered, okay?

258
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:35,123
Suck their fingers.

259
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:37,878
- I'm getting horny.
- I know.

260
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:44,259
Right? Don't fuckingtouch the .45, okay?

261
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:49,099
Want to know Al? Al is really
good at getting things.

262
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,766
Cars, jewelry, clothes.

263
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:56,437
Women. But he doesn't know
how to take care of them.

264
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,548
I was his property.

265
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:03,619
And call me crazy, I just wanted something
a little bit more than that, okay?

266
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,233
So we broke up,
and now no one'll date me

267
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:07,539
all the guys are scared.

268
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:10,333
I gotta date guys from
Jersey. It's horrible.

269
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,601
What?

270
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:21,751
- It's Vic.
- Aw fuck, it's the dyke from

271
00:16:21,753 --> 00:16:24,247
Shut up, she's my friend. Be nice.
One second!

272
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:26,529
Can't fucking stand her.
She always ruins everything.

273
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,368
Shut up!

274
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,768
- She's bisexual, ok?
- So what? She's still a fucking dyke.

275
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:38,236
You have to remind me about
your fling with her?

276
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:41,320
It was one drunken night.
Don't be such a fucking woman.

277
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,593
One sec, sweetie.

278
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:47,184
- Hi.
- Hello, lover.

279
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:49,916
- How are you, beautiful.
- I am great.

280
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:53,284
Please, no lesbo action
in front of me, okay?

281
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:55,373
- Unless it's a threesome, c'mon.
- Don't mind him.

282
00:16:55,374 --> 00:16:57,945
That's alright.
I'm used to his slime.

283
00:16:57,946 --> 00:16:59,559
Hey, how you doing?

284
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,205
You look so great.

285
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:04,497
Oh my god, your hair looks amazing?

286
00:17:04,498 --> 00:17:06,425
You like that?
Don't you think her hair looks great?

287
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:09,067
Looks like she did it with
a wrench of something.

288
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:11,562
- Just shut up.
- Nice to see you too, buddy.

289
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:14,244
- Sit down. You want something to drink?
- Sure.

290
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:19,927
She lives with me now,
lesbo, okay?

291
00:17:21,504 --> 00:17:25,093
Okay. Yeah, it would seem so,
seeing as I knocked on your front door

292
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:27,145
and she answered it

293
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,537
Al, you confused yet?

294
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:31,329
- What?
- Drunk yet?

295
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,641
- Come on babe, you can do it.
- It's that obvious, is it?

296
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:36,573
- You fucking drunk.
- Come here, baby.

297
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,374
Fuck! Son of a whore!

298
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,169
Al, stop it!

299
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,174
- Jesus Christ!
- You sir are a moron.

300
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:51,962
You are the walking talking reason that
we should all be lesbians.

301
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:54,275
Yes, I think I just became one.

302
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:56,321
- So, your hair looks amazing.
- Thank you.

303
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:57,371
Really looking good.

304
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:59,799
- Plus y'know I've been uh, I been hitting the gym a lot.
- Oh yeah?

305
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,061
I've already added like 2 inches
to my arms, an inch to my chest

306
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:03,662
Nice.

307
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:05,794
Trying to get those big shoulders
so I can beat up Al.

308
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,929
I wanted Al dead
from the moment I met him.

309
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,643
It was his maleness that I detested.

310
00:18:10,644 --> 00:18:12,161
His essence.

311
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:15,132
It wasn't his fault.
He couldn't get away with it, y'know.

312
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:18,259
It was him. He was the product
of his horrible childhood.

313
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,684
But...

314
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:21,860
Give a kiss.

315
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:29,709
Yeah, see what you're missing?

316
00:18:30,831 --> 00:18:32,827
See you later.

317
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:37,165
No tongue fucking action
while I'm away, girls.

318
00:18:38,206 --> 00:18:41,818
I just came in her five minutes ago.

319
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:43,445
Thanks for the head's up.

320
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:45,811
Get outta here.

321
00:18:52,651 --> 00:18:54,472
Is it good?

322
00:19:04,933 --> 00:19:07,324
- Who's it for?
- Jose Vargas.

323
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:09,001
What?

324
00:19:10,489 --> 00:19:14,254
The one thing we gotta stick to is
I didn't sell it to Jose. Okay?

325
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:17,223
Al would kill me if he knew
I sold to a Puerto Rican.

326
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,674
As long as he doesn't think...

327
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:20,925
I sold to a Puerto Rican,
we're fine, we're fine.

328
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:24,553
He's just the muscle.
I'm the broad with all the plans, right?

329
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:26,768
I'm the businesswoman, I got
the big plans.

330
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,277
- You got big plans?
- Yeah.

331
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:32,324
- You know.
- I hope I'm in them.

332
00:19:36,393 --> 00:19:38,476
You know you are.

333
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:46,152
Kat, if he hurts you again,
I'll fucking kill him.

334
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:48,041
That's a promise.

335
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:53,353
My daughter Kat.

336
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:57,444
She was always attracted to danger.
Yeah, even as a little girl.

337
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:00,651
She was always doing something that
she wasn't supposed to do, I mean

338
00:20:00,652 --> 00:20:03,133
You tell her not to do something,
she would do it anyways.

339
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:05,631
"Don't drink", she'd drink.
"Don't do drugs", she did drugs.

340
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:09,004
"Watch out for boys"
Forget about it.

341
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:12,224
I mean she was just always defiant.

342
00:20:12,225 --> 00:20:14,260
She just always wanted too much, y'know

343
00:20:14,261 --> 00:20:16,780
She could never just be normal.
She always had to be special.

344
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:18,710
And look where it got her.

345
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:21,541
Well I am not surprised.

346
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:25,541
She was always beautiful and
most proud of her hair

347
00:20:25,543 --> 00:20:26,855
And she got that from me

348
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:31,388
Reilly, Reilly, Reilly, Reilly, you get
more ass than a fucking toilet seat.

349
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:33,624
I'm talking about
some quality ass.

350
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:34,577
Quality, shit.

351
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:36,569
What matters is what's
between her legs.

352
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,752
- But you got Kat.
- Yeah, well.

353
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:42,176
You can't have everything, right?

354
00:20:42,856 --> 00:20:45,690
What do you think of me
going back with Dell again?

355
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:48,977
Aw fuck, Reilly, will you please
fucking get over her, she's a fucking ho.

356
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:53,381
Fucking been fucked in the ass so many fucking
times her ass looks like a science experiment.

357
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:56,131
What can I tell you? She turns me on.

358
00:20:56,132 --> 00:20:59,092
Everything turns you on. You're
the horniest guy I know, Reilly.

359
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:01,251
You would do anything
for a piece of fucking pussy.

360
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:04,358
I decided to turn over a new leaf.

361
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:07,494
- What?
- I'm going back to church, becoming Catholic again

362
00:21:07,495 --> 00:21:09,959
- Renouncing it all.
- Reilly.

363
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,608
I'm so fucking tired of hearing this song and
dance. I've heard it all before, alright?

364
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:16,679
That's it for me, man.
I want a normal life.

365
00:21:16,681 --> 00:21:19,239
A normal life, and a normal job.

366
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:22,576
- What are we doing here? What are we doing?
- Don't fucking worry about it.

367
00:21:22,577 --> 00:21:23,406
Nothing illegal, alright?

368
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,206
I told you, I started this morning,
I'm turning over a new leaf.

369
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:30,043
Leaf. Reilly, you need to
turn over a new fucking tree.

370
00:21:30,377 --> 00:21:31,821
You know...

371
00:21:31,955 --> 00:21:33,954
There's always a place for you

372
00:21:33,955 --> 00:21:35,961
in my organization.

373
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,656
Why don't you come and be
my right hand man again?

374
00:21:38,657 --> 00:21:42,174
You not hearing me, man?
What the fuck are you talking about?

375
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:43,682
I was never your right hand man.

376
00:21:43,683 --> 00:21:47,851
I was my own man with my own
operations. Did my own fucking jobs.

377
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:49,864
Jesus Christ, I never worked for you, Al!

378
00:21:49,865 --> 00:21:52,846
You fucking need me, Reilly.
Ya need me.

379
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:54,885
Bullshit, Al.

380
00:21:54,985 --> 00:21:57,076
The only fucking thing I need from you

381
00:21:57,076 --> 00:21:59,415
is a woman like Kat.
That's what I need.

382
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,710
What the fuck is it with
this Kat obsession?

383
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:04,139
It is not obsession.

384
00:22:04,638 --> 00:22:07,290
She's a great girl.
That's all.

385
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:09,579
Hey, pull it over here.

386
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:18,827
- What's going on, Al?
- I'm gonna steal that car.

387
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:22,318
That's the fucking car
we took last week.

388
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,146
Yeah, that's right. But now I
gotta fucking take it back.

389
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:26,400
The guy we stole it from

390
00:22:26,401 --> 00:22:28,193
wants it back. He's got a
big fucking reward.

391
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:31,311
I thought I'd be a nice guy and
I'd take it back to him, okay?

392
00:22:31,312 --> 00:22:32,765
What about the guy we sold it to?

393
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:35,682
Fuck him. He's a fucking
nother normal guy at work

394
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:38,686
Just like you want to be.
A normal guy.

395
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:42,074
You know what happens? Normal guys
get fucked. Big Al doesn't.

396
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:46,569
You're about to make a month's
salary in 10 seconds.

397
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,911
Are ya in or are ya out, Mr. Normal?

398
00:22:51,716 --> 00:22:55,257
It's the last time, Al.
This is it.

399
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:58,112
Last motherfucking time.

400
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:18,975
Al shoulda got outta this neighborhood.

401
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,699
Kat wanted that.

402
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,188
And as things turned out...

403
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:27,360
Al should have listened to her.

404
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:35,564
Did I wanna kill Al?

405
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:38,721
Yeah. Many times.

406
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:43,212
Did he have something
I woulda killed for?

407
00:23:43,957 --> 00:23:45,104
Yeah.

408
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:47,721
Hello, ladies.

409
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:51,533
- You got the money?
- It's right here.

410
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:53,149
Let's have it!

411
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,368
- Why don't you get it from me.
- Asshole.

412
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:59,516
Chill, chill, I'm just joking.
Just joking, come here, baby, just joking

413
00:23:59,673 --> 00:24:01,773
You know I wouldn't
play you like that, right?

414
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:03,991
Yeah.

415
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:07,197
- You know I like doing business with you, know that, right?
- Oh yeah?

416
00:24:07,198 --> 00:24:11,137
Well same as always ____, alright
Now get your paws offs me.

417
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:16,437
I'd like to do a lot
more with you, baby

418
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:18,199
Who wouldn't?

419
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,074
You need a man
like me, baby, you know?

420
00:24:21,109 --> 00:24:24,389
- I could show you a couple things, you know what I'm saying?
- Oh yeah?

421
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,070
My boyfriend, Big Al,
he wouldn't like that very much. Okay?

422
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:29,657
I'll get rid of your boyfriend Big Al.

423
00:24:29,658 --> 00:24:32,204
Not interested, Sanchez.
Keep walking, thanks.

424
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:34,570
Could you? Could you get rid of him?

425
00:24:34,804 --> 00:24:38,278
Nothin, like nothin.
Why you with him anyway?

426
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:41,070
He's small time.
A beautiful lady like yourself.

427
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:42,965
You need to be with a man
who's going places in life.

428
00:24:42,966 --> 00:24:44,968
You see me right here?
I'm going places.

429
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:45,858
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

430
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,329
Like Ryker's.
That's where you're going.

431
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,674
See you later, Chico.

432
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:54,808
I'll never want to fuck
you or your attitude.

433
00:24:54,809 --> 00:24:58,744
Shit, you can fuck my attitude, but
I'm a hell of a lot more fun, baby.

434
00:24:58,745 --> 00:25:00,911
See ya around.

435
00:25:00,912 --> 00:25:03,019
_ita, mmmm.

436
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:07,055
I can never, never thank
you enough, detective.

437
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:11,229
It's amazing, there isn't even
a scratch on it. Thank you so much.

438
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,343
Sure.

439
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,589
And if there's anything
I can do for you.

440
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,834
Nah, I'll have the station
contact you in the morning, okay?

441
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:19,215
- Ok
- Ok, thank you. Anything.

442
00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:22,044
Thanks.

443
00:25:24,687 --> 00:25:27,245
Thank you. So much.

444
00:25:27,772 --> 00:25:30,273
To me, sex with men is like snow.

445
00:25:30,274 --> 00:25:33,647
You never know how many inches you're
gonna get or how long it's gonna last.

446
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:37,829
Y'know, the differences between men and
women are just too great for me to even

447
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:39,679
begin to comprehend.
Y'know, like...

448
00:25:39,978 --> 00:25:42,128
Like, okay, a woman...

449
00:25:42,343 --> 00:25:46,283
all she wants to hear from a man are
three words, right?: "I love you."

450
00:25:46,285 --> 00:25:49,594
A man, all he wants to hear are
three words too, but they're different.

451
00:25:50,145 --> 00:25:53,392
"It's so big!"

452
00:25:53,491 --> 00:25:54,595
Right?

453
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:57,281
Wha...? Assholes!

454
00:25:57,446 --> 00:26:00,973
To me, Big Al is the perfect
reason to legalize abortion.

455
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:04,058
You talk about sex more than
any girl I know.

456
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:06,898
You're like the
horniest girl I know.

457
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:10,369
- It's being around you that makes me horny.
- Oh, fuck off.

458
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:13,265
When you gonna dump Al?

459
00:26:14,749 --> 00:26:18,259
Serious? Come on, Vic.

460
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:20,768
Knock it off!

461
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:26,033
We're having fun, right?
I mean come on, it's bad timing.

462
00:26:26,232 --> 00:26:28,490
I'll wait for you.

463
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,402
I mean what do you two
have in common, anyway?

464
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,016
Guns. We both love guns.

465
00:26:38,532 --> 00:26:40,844
And we're both in love with him.

466
00:26:41,544 --> 00:26:43,394
That's what we have in common.

467
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:45,491
You're in love with him?

468
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:48,770
Yeah, Vic, I am.

469
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:52,228
- I'm sorry, but...
- No, hey, know what?

470
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:55,907
Possession is not love.

471
00:26:56,105 --> 00:26:59,622
Alcoholics can't have lovers,
they hold hostages.

472
00:26:59,623 --> 00:27:02,978
And he is no good for you.

473
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:06,323
I am.

474
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,005
I'll even treat you like
shit if you want me to.

475
00:27:12,277 --> 00:27:14,743
Thank you. Let's go.

476
00:27:23,993 --> 00:27:26,554
- Huh.
- You're late, you fucking ___

477
00:27:27,377 --> 00:27:29,698
So somebody's gotta make a
fucking living around here.

478
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:33,316
Look at Reilly.

479
00:27:35,313 --> 00:27:36,861
Dumb.

480
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,349
Dumb and _____

481
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,299
No, bumt like takes 2 hours
to watch 60 minutes kinda dumb.

482
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,324
- Think I'm gonna head home with Vic tonight.
- Good luck.

483
00:27:46,325 --> 00:27:49,533
She's a fucking beast.
You know she prefers pussy, right?

484
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,662
It's a challenge.

485
00:27:51,862 --> 00:27:54,474
Yeah, well I wouldn't fuck her.

486
00:27:55,248 --> 00:27:57,991
She can't be that bad
if Kat puts up with her.

487
00:27:57,992 --> 00:27:59,835
What's that supposed to mean?

488
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:05,918
- Hi, girls. -Hey.
- Hi.

489
00:28:09,143 --> 00:28:11,935
- What are you laughing about?
- Hey, I wanna talk to you in the back.

490
00:28:11,935 --> 00:28:14,702
- Reilly, how are you?
- Good.

491
00:28:16,387 --> 00:28:18,833
- Hey. Hey. Hey!
- What?

492
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:21,524
Fuck's sake. Do you see
what I gotta deal with?

493
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:22,563
Come on.

494
00:28:22,564 --> 00:28:25,410
I'm coming. Easy.

495
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:30,514
Hey Vic, could I buy you a beer?

496
00:28:30,515 --> 00:28:32,352
I don't drink.

497
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,120
I'm Irish, been Irish my whole life.

498
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:38,245
Really? What a coincidence.

499
00:28:38,246 --> 00:28:39,969
Look, Reilly, I'm not, uh...

500
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,407
I wasn't born in Ireland,
but my family was.

501
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:47,118
They got the greatest brogue, my parents.
You gotta hear 'em some time.

502
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,693
And my mom, she makes
the best Irish oatmeal in town

503
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:51,536
Really? She make those
cute little sweaters too?

504
00:28:51,537 --> 00:28:53,127
- Yeah, she does, actually.
- Oh my god

505
00:28:53,128 --> 00:28:57,046
She does. She must have a set
of those sweaters that go back...

506
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:00,065
to the early 1800s, I think.

507
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,046
She knows all those Irish songs.
Danny Boy and shit.

508
00:29:04,047 --> 00:29:05,593
And my father...

509
00:29:05,692 --> 00:29:08,623
he knew guy who invented
Irish Spring soap.

510
00:29:08,624 --> 00:29:10,437
How about that?

511
00:29:10,438 --> 00:29:13,099
Everyone in this whole fucking
neighborhood was Irish...

512
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,833
Alright, I get it! You're Irish.

513
00:29:14,834 --> 00:29:17,991
- Just relax, eat a fucking potato.
- What?

514
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:22,142
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just, I'm uh

515
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:24,637
not feeling like myself tonight.
I'm a little agitated.

516
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:26,684
No worries.

517
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:28,692
What nationality are you?

518
00:29:28,693 --> 00:29:30,715
I'm Jewish.

519
00:29:31,697 --> 00:29:34,550
Oh yeah, Jewish? Where's that from?

520
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:36,811
The Bible.

521
00:29:36,812 --> 00:29:39,372
That must go really far back and stuff.

522
00:29:39,373 --> 00:29:41,805
Yeah, it does.

523
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:46,106
- Where do most Jews come from?
- Long Island.

524
00:29:46,139 --> 00:29:48,383
Now would you leave?

525
00:29:54,468 --> 00:29:57,125
I heard you slept
with some women.

526
00:29:57,932 --> 00:30:00,092
So? what about it?

527
00:30:00,515 --> 00:30:02,020
Nothing.

528
00:30:02,021 --> 00:30:03,909
So have I.

529
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:05,652
Really?

530
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:09,452
Good for you, Reilly. Your mom
must be really proud of you.

531
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:11,759
Now would you do me a favor
please and just fuck off?

532
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,447
Wait, am I bothering you or something?

533
00:30:13,448 --> 00:30:16,889
No, I'm always this hostile
when I don't like someone.

534
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:20,918
I really like horror films.
I tell you that?

535
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,200
Yeah, I like 'em a lot.

536
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:26,254
I might go see one on Friday night,
you wanna come with me?

537
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:28,760
Jesus, Reilly!
You are a fucking horror film.

538
00:30:28,761 --> 00:30:32,769
Buddy, take the hint, alright? Move on to your
next victim. I'm not interested, alright?

539
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:36,309
- Why not?
- Because all you wanna do is dip the stick.

540
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,919
- That's not true.
- That's not true?

541
00:30:38,953 --> 00:30:40,663
Nah.

542
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:45,033
Jesus. You're so tough, you know that?

543
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:50,646
Alright. Gimme one good reason
why you won't let me poke you.

544
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:52,251
One good reason?

545
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:54,296
Well don't take this personally,
but I don't like you.

546
00:30:54,297 --> 00:30:56,310
That's not a reason.

547
00:30:56,311 --> 00:30:58,047
That's an excuse.

548
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,401
- Why me?
- That's what that is.

549
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:03,566
You don't want me anyway.

550
00:31:03,568 --> 00:31:05,234
You want Kat.

551
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:07,476
But you can't get her.

552
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:12,357
- Yeah, there's only one problem there.
- What?

553
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,841
- Al
- Al

554
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:21,178
Why don't you knock Al off?

555
00:31:23,597 --> 00:31:25,593
Do us all a favor.
Get rid of him.

556
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:27,967
Maybe then she could be yours.

557
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:32,461
Al's my friend. I don't do friends.
I don't do things like that.

558
00:31:32,462 --> 00:31:34,788
It's a mere detail.

559
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:37,520
Come on, Reilly, be bold.

560
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:40,126
Try something new.
Do a friend.

561
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,188
I mean he doesn't like you, anyway.
He talks shit

562
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:44,340
about you behind your back all the time.

563
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:46,236
Oh yeah?

564
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,915
Like what?

565
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,598
Say.

566
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:54,172
- You're not afraid of him, are you?
- Hell no.

567
00:31:54,255 --> 00:31:56,203
So get rid of him then.

568
00:31:56,204 --> 00:31:58,012
He thinks you're a punk.

569
00:31:58,013 --> 00:32:01,275
Fuck, I'm not doing
things like that anymore.

570
00:32:01,574 --> 00:32:06,201
I'm making some changes and I'm
really following my religion now.

571
00:32:06,202 --> 00:32:08,956
Following your religion?
How sweet.

572
00:32:08,957 --> 00:32:11,647
I think it's a little late
for that, don't you?

573
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:18,306
All of this very stimulating conversation is
making me have to go to the bathroom and throw up.

574
00:32:18,307 --> 00:32:19,813
Wait.

575
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:22,127
Come on, can I have you, huh?

576
00:32:23,612 --> 00:32:25,251
Come on.

577
00:32:26,251 --> 00:32:28,038
I want you.

578
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:30,309
Alright.

579
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:34,235
Alright, Reilly. There is one way
that I will sleep with you.

580
00:32:35,185 --> 00:32:37,265
Get rid of Al.

581
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:42,001
- You're pretty demanding.
- You should see me in bed.

582
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,086
- You're a good guy.
- Thanks.

583
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:51,326
You should think about it.

584
00:32:52,301 --> 00:32:53,998
I will.

585
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:57,308
I'm worth the trouble.

586
00:33:00,156 --> 00:33:02,575
I bet you are.

587
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,392
He's now a fucking good
Catholic boy.

588
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,142
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

589
00:33:12,143 --> 00:33:15,500
Fucking don't _____, turn
the other fucking cheek.

590
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:17,529
Fuck you.

591
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,557
Hey, Reilly, how's it going?

592
00:33:24,473 --> 00:33:27,764
- You're beautiful.
- Are you fucking drunk?

593
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:30,179
I want to kiss you right now.

594
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,465
You're fucking drunk.

595
00:33:32,466 --> 00:33:34,414
I've always wanted
you to be my girl.

596
00:33:34,415 --> 00:33:36,450
Hey Reilly! Come on.

597
00:33:36,451 --> 00:33:38,741
I'll be over there
in a minute! I'm coming!

598
00:33:38,742 --> 00:33:42,940
- Papa's calling you, Reilly.
- You come with me and I'll get you outta this fucking neighborhood.

599
00:33:42,941 --> 00:33:45,684
You know he won't.

600
00:33:54,622 --> 00:33:58,361
- Quite a catch, eh, that Reilly.
- He's pretty hot. Pretty sexy.

601
00:33:58,362 --> 00:34:01,264
Sexy?
I thought you were in love.

602
00:34:01,265 --> 00:34:04,809
Just because I ordered dinner doesn't
mean I can't see what's on the menu, huh?

603
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:08,384
Well, I don't know if your waiter told you,
but I'm one of the specials this evening.

604
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:12,548
Shit! Look who just walked in.

605
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:16,703
- Fuck! Assholes.
- I told them never to come here.

606
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,292
What's up, my _ita?
Got a light for my cigarette?

607
00:34:23,293 --> 00:34:26,271
You fucking crazy coming round here?
What the fuck are you doing here?

608
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,267
Give the lighter.

609
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:33,127
- Why you so nervous? Calmate
- Just take the fucking light.

610
00:34:33,128 --> 00:34:35,170
Al.

611
00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:42,327
Jesus Christ.

612
00:34:42,328 --> 00:34:46,592
- See you around.
- Get off my shit, yo.

613
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,905
That spic is disrespecting you.

614
00:34:50,906 --> 00:34:53,745
Put him in his place.

615
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:56,088
You wanna mess with a fucking white girl?

616
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:59,351
- Do not move.
- You wanna mess with a fucking white girl?

617
00:35:02,009 --> 00:35:05,449
- What?
- Please just sit down.

618
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:10,829
- What did I do?
- Do not be stupid, you fucking whore.

619
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,409
- No. I don't know what I did.
- You know what you did.

620
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:19,450
- I don't.
- I saw you talking to that fucking Puerto Rican guy.

621
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,730
Ah, so that's what this is about,
the Puerto Rican guy. No.

622
00:35:22,731 --> 00:35:26,439
He came to me and asked me for a
cigarette, alright? I told him to fuck off.

623
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,776
- You touched his arm.
- No I didn't touch his arm. What are you talking about?

624
00:35:29,777 --> 00:35:33,345
- Don't fucking lie to me.
- Look, I didn't mean to touch his arm, okay?

625
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:38,114
- Hey, baby...
- You're drunk.

626
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:40,731
Come here.

627
00:35:40,732 --> 00:35:43,993
Come here, your big monkey.

628
00:35:45,532 --> 00:35:49,131
- Fuck you.
- You were talking to him, and...

629
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:52,451
- Shut up.
- Fucking I know you lit his cigarette and...

630
00:35:52,452 --> 00:35:56,051
- you touched his arm...
- Al, what's that supposed to...

631
00:35:56,052 --> 00:35:58,052
Then he tried to get a
piece of fucking tit, right?

632
00:35:58,053 --> 00:36:01,315
Huh? Huh, baby?

633
00:36:04,773 --> 00:36:10,073
- Then I saw him looking at your...
- Listen, will you stop it already?

634
00:36:10,074 --> 00:36:11,204
Beautiful legs.

635
00:36:13,773 --> 00:36:17,015
You look like a whore
tonight in that dress.

636
00:36:17,016 --> 00:36:18,959
You like looking like a whore.

637
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,413
- You bought me this dress.
- You like dressing like a whore.

638
00:36:21,414 --> 00:36:24,653
You said I looked country in it.
"Faith Hill", you said.

639
00:36:24,654 --> 00:36:27,293
You wanna suck my cock, right?

640
00:36:27,294 --> 00:36:31,957
Yeah? You wanna suck
his cock too, right?

641
00:36:32,855 --> 00:36:35,614
- Shut the fuck up.
- No, you shut the fuck up.

642
00:36:35,615 --> 00:36:37,934
You wanna fucking suck some Puerto
Rican cock. Fucking

643
00:36:37,935 --> 00:36:39,576
- answer me.
- Get off me!

644
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:41,658
You fucking white trash, you

645
00:36:41,735 --> 00:36:46,855
Hanging out with Vic lesbo all night,
the three of youse, you sick fucking ho.

646
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:51,214
I saw the way you were fucking looking
at each other! You fucking disgust me!

647
00:36:51,215 --> 00:36:56,071
Fucking answer me one fucking question,
okay? What did he say to you?

648
00:36:56,136 --> 00:37:00,036
- Nothing! He asked for a light!
- Fuck you, fucking liar!

649
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:05,998
Sorry, sorry baby, sorry, sorry.
Okay, come here honey.

650
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:12,936
It's okay, it's okay.
I just gotta tell you

651
00:37:12,937 --> 00:37:16,816
You embarrassed me
in front of my fucking friends, baby.

652
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:20,536
You fucking, how the fuck
am I supposed to keep their respect?

653
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:25,017
"There goes your woman talking to a Puerto
Rican spic", that's what fucking Reilly said!

654
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:28,918
"She wants some fucking spic cock!"
Is that what you want, you fucking cunt?

655
00:37:28,978 --> 00:37:33,977
You expect me to eat some
dirty spic-fucked pussy?

656
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:39,202
You want me to fuck a spic-fucked cunt?
You fucking bitch!

657
00:37:40,939 --> 00:37:43,857
You fucking slut! Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck

658
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:47,538
Motherfucker! I told you motherfucker,
I have fucking had it with

659
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:50,863
- Fuck you, sit down, you fucking fucker
- Stop!

660
00:37:50,898 --> 00:37:54,607
You spic-cocksucking whore
Stay down!

661
00:37:54,642 --> 00:37:57,939
- Don't fucking move!
- No! Please, please, please.

662
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:02,716
- Stop, please!
- Come here. Cut your face.

663
00:38:02,979 --> 00:38:06,619
- Fuck that face.
- Stop it!

664
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,322
- Do not fucking move.

665
00:38:08,323 --> 00:38:13,545
I'll make you so fucking ugly, nobody'll
fucking look at you except for me.

666
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:18,563
Please, Al, please, Al

667
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:27,464
Baby, baby. Baby.

668
00:38:29,461 --> 00:38:34,647
- He touched your fucking hair.
- He said he liked my hair.

669
00:38:34,661 --> 00:38:38,074
- He said he liked my hair.
- See? But you lied to me.

670
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:41,661
You lie, you see?
You're hiding shit from me.

671
00:38:41,662 --> 00:38:43,409
- You understand?
- No, please.

672
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:45,712
Why didn't you tell me that before?

673
00:38:45,747 --> 00:38:50,365
- I don't know. I don't know
- Come here, baby. Come here. Okay, okay.

674
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:54,182
- I don't ever wanna see you
- Please!

675
00:38:54,183 --> 00:38:56,507
- Listen to me, baby.
- Please, Al!

676
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,747
Baby, baby, baby, baby. I don't ever
wanna see you dressed like this again.

677
00:39:01,623 --> 00:39:07,982
You look like a whore in that dress.
Take it off. Take it off. Take it off.

678
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:10,462
- Please.
- Come on.

679
00:39:10,463 --> 00:39:12,317
Give it here.

680
00:39:18,344 --> 00:39:21,743
Take this fucking shit off, alright?

681
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:24,743
C'mon, let's go to the other room.

682
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:27,752
Go to the fucking room.
Let's see what else you got in there.

683
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:31,984
Show your other fucking clothes. Get out
the fucking clothes from the closet, baby.

684
00:39:31,985 --> 00:39:34,584
- Show 'em to me. Give 'em to me.
- These clothes?

685
00:39:34,585 --> 00:39:39,203
Those are fucking whore's clothes, baby!
Fucking whore's clothes!

686
00:39:39,238 --> 00:39:43,384
- Look at this, look at this shit.
- Oh Al, stop it, please.

687
00:39:43,385 --> 00:39:47,843
- It's fucking whore's clothes, baby!
- Do not do it, Al

688
00:39:48,905 --> 00:39:54,825
Please, Al, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I won't talk to anybody anymore. Please.

689
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:57,245
Oh fuck!

690
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:01,802
Alright, come here.
Crawl to the fucking mirror.

691
00:40:01,803 --> 00:40:05,801
Come on, take a look at
yourself in the mirror.

692
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:08,905
You see that? You see that, baby?

693
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,906
You tell me.

694
00:40:10,907 --> 00:40:14,647
- You tell me.
- Stop it, Al!

695
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:17,706
Tell me you're a whore. Tell me you're
a whore Tell me you're a whore!

696
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:22,987
Tell me. Tell me
you fucking love me.

697
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:26,187
- Tell me you fucking love me.
- I love you.

698
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:28,667
Tell me you really wanna
suck my cock, baby.

699
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:31,307
I want to suck your cock!

700
00:40:31,308 --> 00:40:36,084
Baby, baby.

701
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:42,912
- I'll gonna cut your fucking hair.
- No! Fuck you! No! Get off me!

702
00:40:44,042 --> 00:40:47,681
It's the only way
you're gonna learn.

703
00:40:47,716 --> 00:40:51,748
It's the only way you're
gonna fucking learn, baby.

704
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:56,388
It's the only way you're
gonna fucking learn, baby.

705
00:40:56,389 --> 00:40:58,314
Come here!

706
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:08,469
I want to spend the rest of my
life with you, your fucking cunt!

707
00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:20,527
Al! Al!

708
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:29,951
I'm gonna get you a new mirror baby, tomorrow.
I'll get you a new mirror tomorrow.

709
00:41:29,952 --> 00:41:32,910
There's no excuse to go around
treating people the way that he did.

710
00:41:32,911 --> 00:41:36,828
There are some people out there who've
had childhoods far worse than Al's...

711
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:39,071
go on to do great things.

712
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,671
Become model citizens, y'know? Like...

713
00:41:42,672 --> 00:41:47,471
There's a secretary that I used to know.
She had a very terrible childhood, like...

714
00:41:47,472 --> 00:41:53,170
Too bad to get into. Like raped,
incest, ate with her hands, everything.

715
00:41:54,353 --> 00:41:59,152
But, a nice smile on her face
and everything, like... delightful,

716
00:41:59,154 --> 00:42:03,019
funny. Not like this animal, Al.

717
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:05,912
Death penalty.

718
00:42:05,946 --> 00:42:10,313
Shoot him. It should be
quick and brutal.

719
00:42:10,314 --> 00:42:15,833
It's okay. Okay. Okay?

720
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:18,153
- You got... you gotta go, Vic.
- What?

721
00:42:18,154 --> 00:42:21,753
You gotta go, cuz if...

722
00:42:21,754 --> 00:42:25,216
I don't want trouble.
Please just, you gotta go. Please.

723
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:29,297
I am not going anywhere, alright?
You are coming home with me.

724
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:31,063
- No.
- What are you... what are you doing?

725
00:42:31,064 --> 00:42:35,001
I can't, cuz he'll just come
after me, Vic. You know him, please.

726
00:42:35,035 --> 00:42:38,127
I don't want any
more trouble, please.

727
00:42:38,128 --> 00:42:41,053
I'm just scared.

728
00:42:41,652 --> 00:42:43,265
It'll all calm down.

729
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,219
It'll be fine.
It'll be fine.

730
00:42:45,254 --> 00:42:50,007
How the fuck can you
stay with him after this?

731
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:51,195
I love him.

732
00:42:51,196 --> 00:42:54,144
I fucking love him.

733
00:42:54,145 --> 00:42:56,475
That's fucked. Love isn't
supposed to hurt, Kat.

734
00:42:56,476 --> 00:43:01,610
- But I love him, Vic.
- Was this about the guns?

735
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:05,341
No, it wasn't about the guns.
He was just jealous.

736
00:43:06,797 --> 00:43:08,876
- What the fuck?
- It's Reilly.

737
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,836
Don't let him in, please.

738
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:19,840
Hey. Fuck, Jesus Christ, you alright?

739
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:23,957
Holy fuck. Alright, let's
sit down. Let's just sit down.

740
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:25,957
It's Al. It's Al.

741
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,957
Fucking lowlife motherfucker!
Hitting a woman.

742
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:29,957
- Reilly
- How could he do something like that?

743
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:32,758
Don't act so surprised.
This isn't the first time.

744
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:34,918
It's gonna be okay, baby.

745
00:43:34,918 --> 00:43:37,517
What do you mean, okay? You're the one
who went and cut off Jose.

746
00:43:37,518 --> 00:43:39,518
- You're fucking one of them.
- No I didn't.

747
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,518
I didn't, I didn't do anything, okay?

748
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,836
I don't work for Al, Kat. I don't.

749
00:43:43,837 --> 00:43:46,518
Clancy did that with
some other guys, I promise you.

750
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:50,091
- Reilly, Reilly, Reilly.
- Don't worry, Everything's gonna be alright

751
00:43:50,092 --> 00:43:52,318
I'll do anything you want, okay?
It's your call.

752
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,749
You're full of shit, Reilly.
You guys are all full of shit.

753
00:43:54,749 --> 00:43:56,655
Alright, I'm gonna get your stuff.

754
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:59,039
And we're gonna get you outta here, cuz you
can't stay here anymore, okay. I'll take you...

755
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,599
- Come home with me. Okay? That'll be better.
- I don't wanna go with anybody, shit!

756
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,321
Stay here, and I'll wait with you, and I'll beat the fucking
shit out of him when he comes home, right in front of you.

757
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:12,099
- Stay right there, stay right there.
- Honey, it's okay, I'm sorry.

758
00:44:12,135 --> 00:44:15,654
- You shouldn't have done this, Al!
- Get the fuck outta my fucking house!

759
00:44:15,655 --> 00:44:17,320
- Fuck you!
- Don't fucking touch her!

760
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,680
No, you don't touch her! You don't
deserve her, you motherfucker!

761
00:44:19,681 --> 00:44:21,680
- So try it!
- Reilly!

762
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:25,240
- Stop it!
- Stop, Reilly get off him!

763
00:44:28,482 --> 00:44:30,480
- Watch out!
- Reilly, get off of him!

764
00:44:30,481 --> 00:44:33,744
- He has a fucking gun! Somebody call the police!
- You're hurting him, Reilly!

765
00:44:34,082 --> 00:44:38,801
You're hurting him,
Reilly, stop it!

766
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:43,089
Al! Al! Al, are you okay?
You're hurting him, c'mon

767
00:44:54,763 --> 00:44:58,195
They were noisy. Very noisy.

768
00:44:58,197 --> 00:45:01,456
That's all I have to say. I don't wanna
get into any trouble.

769
00:45:01,456 --> 00:45:05,339
What went on behind those closed doors
is none of my business.

770
00:45:09,644 --> 00:45:14,643
- Get them to let me see Al, okay?
- I'm here to help you, and not Al

771
00:45:14,644 --> 00:45:18,323
You think I believe that?
You think I'm fucking stupid?

772
00:45:18,324 --> 00:45:22,220
You don't think I know that you want me to
help the cops put Al away for a long time

773
00:45:22,254 --> 00:45:24,531
And I'm not gonna fucking have
anything to do with it. You got that?

774
00:45:24,566 --> 00:45:28,567
Look, I, I don't know what Al's done
in the past, and honestly I don't care.

775
00:45:28,602 --> 00:45:32,474
I'm here because I was assigned
to your case, to help you.

776
00:45:32,509 --> 00:45:35,685
This is my job, alright?
I talk to battered women.

777
00:45:35,686 --> 00:45:40,604
Battered women? What the fuck does that
mean, battered women? What is that?

778
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:46,245
What, a fucking shake and bake or something? Fucking battered
fucking chicken. What the fuck are you talking about?

779
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:50,749
Come on, Kat.
Look at you. He clearly hurt you.

780
00:45:50,886 --> 00:45:55,555
What? He threw me a beating, so what?

781
00:45:55,556 --> 00:45:58,606
I mean, I get a beating once,
once in a blue moon.

782
00:45:58,607 --> 00:46:01,406
This wasn't just a beating.

783
00:46:01,407 --> 00:46:04,669
YOu gonna wait til the next time,
until he actually kills you?

784
00:46:11,808 --> 00:46:15,468
- He didn't mean it, okay?
- Listen to me.

785
00:46:15,847 --> 00:46:19,087
You can protect yourself, alright?
Talk to me.

786
00:46:19,088 --> 00:46:21,582
Nothing you say
is gonna leave this room.

787
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:25,807
Yeah, right. The fucking
walls have ears.

788
00:46:25,808 --> 00:46:29,888
I am not asking you to
rat out your boyfriend.

789
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:32,738
Alright? All I'm asking you

790
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:37,865
is how a man who loves a woman
would do this to her?

791
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:42,251
And why a woman
like you would stay?

792
00:46:44,209 --> 00:46:46,735
You don't have to say anything
if you don't want to.

793
00:46:46,736 --> 00:46:50,334
We can, uh, we can just
sit here for awhile.

794
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:54,905
He cut my hair.

795
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:05,689
Oh Jesus, look, it was a fucking accident,
alright? I didn't try to kill her.

796
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,546
It would've been murder
if the bullet had hit her.

797
00:47:07,547 --> 00:47:11,706
Yeah, but it didn't. It grazed her, okay?
On accident. I wouldn't kill Kat!

798
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:14,450
She gives the best
fucking head in New York.

799
00:47:14,451 --> 00:47:18,366
- I can see you think quite highly of her.
- Okay, look...

800
00:47:18,691 --> 00:47:24,251
If somebody was trying to come after your
man, right? You wouldn't want to hurt her?

801
00:47:24,252 --> 00:47:26,771
No one is worth killing for.

802
00:47:26,772 --> 00:47:30,091
I guess you haven't
had a taste of Kat.

803
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:34,748
So, um... married?

804
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,232
Divorced.

805
00:47:37,852 --> 00:47:39,717
Lonely, huh?

806
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:42,908
Not at all. My work
keeps me very busy.

807
00:47:50,213 --> 00:47:52,493
You want to fuck me, don't you?

808
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:56,093
This may be hard for you to believe,
but I can resist your charms.

809
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:00,673
Okay. You would be the first.

810
00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:03,961
What about your girlfriend
who's about to put you away?

811
00:48:03,996 --> 00:48:05,653
What would she say if you
heard you talking like this?

812
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:08,177
Please don't be so dramatic, okay?
I'm not going anywhere except for home.

813
00:48:08,178 --> 00:48:11,726
Home sweet home. Betcha.

814
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:16,586
Kat's not pressing charges.
She can't live without me, you see?

815
00:48:16,695 --> 00:48:18,664
She fucking loves me.

816
00:48:20,775 --> 00:48:25,934
- So what do you think of me, huh?
- I think you're homicidal and psychopathic.

817
00:48:25,935 --> 00:48:29,094
And that if left on the streets,
you'll probably kill someone.

818
00:48:29,095 --> 00:48:34,553
- Maybe yourself.
- Don't you fucking say that, I'll fucking kill you!

819
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:39,015
What is it? What the fuck is wrong
with you, moron? You're a tough guy?

820
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:42,234
Tougher than me?
You think you're cute, Clancy,

821
00:48:42,269 --> 00:48:43,735
But I know you.

822
00:48:43,736 --> 00:48:46,418
All I said in the bar was she was
talking to the fucking Puerto Rican.

823
00:48:46,452 --> 00:48:49,003
Fuck off, bitch!
I know you're an asshole, alright?

824
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:51,824
Coward scumbag motherfucker
whose feet smell

825
00:48:51,858 --> 00:48:54,702
And Kat caught a beating
because of what you fucking said!

826
00:48:54,737 --> 00:48:57,836
Bullshit. She deserves it.
You can't trust her.

827
00:48:57,871 --> 00:48:59,856
You wanna watch what you say, Clancy.

828
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:02,457
I'm telling you, mind your fucking
business or you're gonna get hurt.

829
00:49:02,457 --> 00:49:04,939
- Are you threatening me?
- Hey, Fuck you!

830
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,971
You don't have anything
to worry about from me!

831
00:49:06,972 --> 00:49:11,737
You got Kat, you got Reilly, you got the fucking
spics! You think Jose's gonna drop you cutting him?

832
00:49:11,738 --> 00:49:17,257
I'm telling you... watch your back. You got a big
fucking mouth and it's gonna get you killed!

833
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:18,794
You're not scaring me, you know.

834
00:49:18,898 --> 00:49:23,377
I'm not? Well then, you're just fucking
retarded! See you in the morgue, genius.

835
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:26,017
Look, I don't plan to l
ive here all my life, alright?

836
00:49:26,018 --> 00:49:27,985
I got dreams of getting out.

837
00:49:29,194 --> 00:49:32,720
Y'know, Al and I have big plans to maybe
move to the beach or something.

838
00:49:32,899 --> 00:49:36,258
Y'know not, not this year,
but hopefully next year.

839
00:49:36,259 --> 00:49:39,618
- You like the beach?
- Yeah, I like the beach.

840
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:44,698
I love the beach, okay? I love it. Al says he's
gonna get us a place there. He promises me.

841
00:49:44,699 --> 00:49:47,206
Kat, you don't need
Al to get that far.

842
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:50,002
You'll be surprised at how much
you can do all on your own.

843
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,379
- Alright, we better stop here.
- Why?

844
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,339
Because, okay? I don't want trouble.
Alright?

845
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:00,080
I got neighbors, and they're
gonna talk and stuff, okay?

846
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:06,282
Give me a call, okay?
Come on.

847
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:10,034
You are trouble.

848
00:51:01,064 --> 00:51:02,496
Fucking shells!

849
00:51:04,824 --> 00:51:08,649
What the fuck was
I fucking thinking?

850
00:51:11,024 --> 00:51:14,184
Fucking shells!

851
00:51:14,184 --> 00:51:19,704
Somebody should have killed Al a long time
ago. I wanted to a lot of times, but...

852
00:51:19,705 --> 00:51:25,384
I couldn't. Y'know, I knew him a
long time and shit. It just...

853
00:51:25,385 --> 00:51:28,445
Wouldn't have been a
good thing to do, y'know?

854
00:51:28,446 --> 00:51:32,353
It's a neighborhood thing.
We got rules.

855
00:51:32,545 --> 00:51:37,265
Sure, we had fights. Yeah.

856
00:51:37,266 --> 00:51:41,405
We saw things differently
many a times. Most times.

857
00:51:41,426 --> 00:51:45,366
But it wouldn't have been cool.

858
00:51:46,226 --> 00:51:49,025
- Hey, trouble.
- Hi.

859
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:53,370
- It's on the house.
- I, no, I can't accept stolen goods.

860
00:51:54,227 --> 00:51:57,426
You kidding me? I didn't steal it.
Al stole it.

861
00:51:57,428 --> 00:52:01,435
Just take it, alright? I mean c'mon,
don't make me feel like shit, please?

862
00:52:01,436 --> 00:52:03,080
Alright, alright.

863
00:52:03,828 --> 00:52:05,992
You want to come in?

864
00:52:06,508 --> 00:52:09,850
- Yeah.
- Come in.

865
00:52:10,788 --> 00:52:14,507
- I'll make you some toast.
- Ok

866
00:52:14,508 --> 00:52:19,747
Now, listen to me. Al's going to be a free man
in 24 hours, so you have to make a decision.

867
00:52:19,748 --> 00:52:22,393
Press charges or get
a court order.

868
00:52:22,394 --> 00:52:25,068
I mean, how do you know
so much about Al?

869
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:29,492
Because I was married
with a man just like him.

870
00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:33,693
- Wow.
- I wanna show you something.

871
00:52:35,918 --> 00:52:37,618
Jesus Christ.

872
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:44,405
- How long ago was that?
- It was, uh, 6 years.

873
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:49,278
After I left him I went
back to school, y'know, I

874
00:52:50,066 --> 00:52:52,497
got my degree.

875
00:52:53,431 --> 00:52:57,033
- You're crazy.
- My whole life changed for the better.

876
00:52:57,034 --> 00:53:01,976
It did, and leaving him was
the best thing I ever did.

877
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,710
- I'm scared.
- You can do that. You can do that too.

878
00:53:05,711 --> 00:53:09,975
You weren't scared, though? You weren't scared
he was gonna come back and come after you?

879
00:53:12,311 --> 00:53:17,815
Y'know, I... couldn't afford
to be scared anymore.

880
00:53:23,952 --> 00:53:26,551
- Hey, Sarge.
- Hey, Reilly.

881
00:53:30,133 --> 00:53:31,738
- Hey.
- You hear anything yet?

882
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:35,993
- No, and you?
- No.

883
00:53:38,112 --> 00:53:40,362
- Beer.
- Yeah.

884
00:53:43,467 --> 00:53:44,646
There you go.

885
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,649
I wanna kill him.

886
00:53:57,394 --> 00:53:59,694
I'll kill the motherfucker.

887
00:54:03,314 --> 00:54:06,816
Reilly, that's probably the
smartest thing you've ever said.

888
00:54:10,835 --> 00:54:15,095
This is it. I mean,
it's where I live.

889
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:18,173
We need to find you
a place to live.

890
00:54:18,174 --> 00:54:21,389
I could stay at my friend
Vic's house, but uh...

891
00:54:22,196 --> 00:54:24,354
I don't think that's
a very good idea.

892
00:54:24,355 --> 00:54:29,834
- Why not?
- Because I'll start off on her couch...

893
00:54:29,835 --> 00:54:33,212
and end up on her bed.
You know what I'm saying?

894
00:54:35,676 --> 00:54:37,715
What?

895
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:41,439
Does that freak you out,
that I slept with a girl?

896
00:54:42,517 --> 00:54:44,956
No, no...

897
00:54:44,957 --> 00:54:48,076
No. Why? No. No.

898
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:50,116
Live and let live, I always say.

899
00:54:50,117 --> 00:54:54,781
Yeah, live and let live. That's
what I always say too, y'know.

900
00:54:57,397 --> 00:55:00,439
Live and let live.

901
00:55:01,638 --> 00:55:06,300
You're so uptight.
You gotta loosen up.

902
00:55:07,278 --> 00:55:13,055
Anyway, besides. It's not far enough.
It's down the block. I mean...

903
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:18,259
I'm probably gonna, y'know, end up finding
a hotel downtown or something, y'know

904
00:55:18,558 --> 00:55:22,517
- You could stay with me.
- I couldn't ask you to do that.

905
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:27,135
No, ah, no, it's no trouble, at all.
I have the room.

906
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,238
- I'll think about it. Thanks.
- Listen to me.

907
00:55:31,239 --> 00:55:35,398
You are a woman and you have power
and you need to use it.

908
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:39,641
Lips, tits, hips.

909
00:55:39,642 --> 00:55:42,439
All woman.

910
00:55:42,475 --> 00:55:43,791
Y'know, you gotta
think about it that way.

911
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:47,680
Use your power as a woman
to change your life.

912
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:51,217
- Have you slept with a woman?
- No, no, uh...

913
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:58,501
- Are you coming on to me?
- Maybe. Do you want me to?

914
00:55:58,561 --> 00:56:00,028
I mean, come on.

915
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:07,120
That's what this is
all about, right? "Help"

916
00:56:07,121 --> 00:56:10,680
No. No, that is not
why we are helping you.

917
00:56:10,681 --> 00:56:14,281
And contrary to what you might believe,
not everybody wants something from you.

918
00:56:14,282 --> 00:56:15,812
I'm here doing my job.

919
00:56:15,813 --> 00:56:18,401
I'm not here to take advantage of you.

920
00:56:18,857 --> 00:56:20,953
I promise you that.

921
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,463
I promise.

922
00:56:23,498 --> 00:56:27,254
Well, thank you. But I don't
believe a word you're telling me, okay?

923
00:56:27,722 --> 00:56:30,472
Nobody does something for nothing.

924
00:56:32,843 --> 00:56:35,131
When I was 9 years old...

925
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:41,729
He told me he wished
I'd never been born.

926
00:56:43,843 --> 00:56:47,380
He said he'd
never fucking wanted kids.

927
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,881
But he was always so fucking horny

928
00:56:49,882 --> 00:56:52,499
He just had this
incredible sex drive.

929
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,188
So he couldn't
keep his hands off my mother.

930
00:56:55,815 --> 00:56:57,330
I told him...

931
00:56:57,404 --> 00:57:02,226
That's no excuse. If you don't want kids,
don't fucking have 'em.

932
00:57:02,325 --> 00:57:06,065
I mean, there's too fucking many
unwanted kids out there, right?

933
00:57:06,605 --> 00:57:09,040
Just turn the bitch over
and fuck her in the ass.

934
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:13,127
That's my solution to
birth control, overpopulation...

935
00:57:13,499 --> 00:57:15,886
Turn the fucking bitch right over
and fuck her in the ass.

936
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,445
- Hey, how you doing?
- Al

937
00:57:32,446 --> 00:57:35,445
I'm gonna yell for Vic and Liz,
they're downstairs.

938
00:57:35,446 --> 00:57:38,046
- They're gonna call the cops.
- No you won't.

939
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,414
Al, you're not supposed to be here, okay?

940
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:41,886
Don't make this harder for me
than it already is.

941
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:45,606
I don't want that fucking bitch
coming around here investigating us.

942
00:57:45,607 --> 00:57:48,806
- No!
- I'm fucking warning you. Okay?

943
00:57:48,807 --> 00:57:54,122
- I don't want her coming around here. I'm fucking warning you.
- Ow! ow, ow, ow

944
00:57:54,127 --> 00:57:56,313
Come on.

945
00:57:59,248 --> 00:58:01,846
Well, she has never had
any luck with men, but...

946
00:58:01,847 --> 00:58:04,567
I mean, she just doesn't know
how to keep a man. Never has.

947
00:58:04,568 --> 00:58:09,520
Like me, my fourth husband and I,
we have been happily married for two years.

948
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:10,843
It just works.

949
00:58:10,844 --> 00:58:14,308
Gertie. Will you shut your
fat mouth and cook me something?

950
00:58:14,309 --> 00:58:17,250
Shut your fat yap, you fat fuck!

951
00:58:17,251 --> 00:58:20,504
We're gonna eat when I'm
goddamned good and ready, okay?

952
00:58:24,049 --> 00:58:26,928
Look, I do not know where she got
her problem with men from, okay?

953
00:58:26,929 --> 00:58:30,192
Maybe it was from her father.
I mean, he is crazy.

954
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:34,742
Shit, Clancy says he saw you talking with
the Puerto Rican motherfucker again.

955
00:58:34,743 --> 00:58:37,494
- I didn't talk to him, alright?
- Did you wanna suck his cock?

956
00:58:37,495 --> 00:58:39,979
- No, I didn't suck his fucking cock!
- Admit it!

957
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:43,189
Then why not fucking answer me when I fucking ask you a
question? Why'd it take you so long to think about it?

958
00:58:43,191 --> 00:58:48,876
- You have to fucking think about it?
- No, I didn't have to fucking think about it! Jesus fucking Christ, you're making me goddamn fucking nervous, alright?

959
00:58:48,971 --> 00:58:49,252
Alright.

960
00:58:49,253 --> 00:58:51,489
I feel like I'm on fucking "Jeopardy"!

961
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:53,569
Fuck!

962
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:57,170
Are you gonna leave at the first sign
of a domestic disturbance?

963
00:58:57,171 --> 00:59:03,062
- Oh Al, oh Al. No, no Al.
- What?

964
00:59:03,098 --> 00:59:07,731
Insanity is not a fucking
domestic disturbance, Al!

965
00:59:07,732 --> 00:59:12,491
It's a disease. It's a rot.
And you're nuts.

966
00:59:12,492 --> 00:59:15,595
- Ok - Let me go, please,
just just let me go, please.

967
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:18,371
Okay, I promise I'm not
gonna hit you anymore, okay?

968
00:59:18,372 --> 00:59:20,411
You said that the last time.

969
00:59:20,412 --> 00:59:22,412
- This time I mean it, alright?
- No. No, I

970
00:59:22,413 --> 00:59:24,411
- I need some time, Al.
- This time I mean it.

971
00:59:24,412 --> 00:59:26,412
I need some time
to think about things, okay?

972
00:59:26,413 --> 00:59:28,411
- Don't leave me.
- To see if I can fucking forgive you

973
00:59:28,413 --> 00:59:30,812
- For fuck's sake!
- Alright, cut the fucking shit!

974
00:59:30,813 --> 00:59:33,452
Cut the fucking shit!
You're not going anywhere, okay?

975
00:59:33,453 --> 00:59:35,025
Don't touch me.

976
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:38,119
- Don't touch me.
- Don't you fucking tell me what I can do to you.

977
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:40,933
I own you. You don't have a fucking
inch of me that's yours, okay?

978
00:59:40,934 --> 00:59:44,555
- I fucking own you. Okay?
- Al...

979
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:48,693
I'm filing a court order of
protection against you, Al.

980
00:59:48,694 --> 00:59:52,093
- It's within my rights. I have...
- You got fucking dick!

981
00:59:52,094 --> 00:59:55,785
You don't have any power! I got the
fucking power! You're a fucking woman.

982
00:59:55,786 --> 00:59:59,413
I'll cut your fucking face up into a million
pieces if you put the fucking court order...

983
00:59:59,414 --> 01:00:01,781
You won't be able to get
within 50 feet of me, Al.

984
01:00:01,782 --> 01:00:03,454
I won't have to.
I'll have somebody else do it.

985
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:06,574
I'll be sitting right here
watching TV, okay?

986
01:00:06,575 --> 01:00:08,459
When you're getting
your face all torn off,

987
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:11,014
I'll have three fucking witnesses.
Police. My fucking friends.

988
01:00:11,015 --> 01:00:13,452
When you're getting
your face all cut up.

989
01:00:13,453 --> 01:00:17,295
Well, I'll be right here. You
won't have any fucking proof, okay?

990
01:00:17,296 --> 01:00:18,760
So...

991
01:00:19,571 --> 01:00:22,177
You'll be so fucking ugly when
you come crawling back to me

992
01:00:22,178 --> 01:00:23,595
I won't even want you anymore.

993
01:00:23,597 --> 01:00:26,655
- Hey Kat, what's going on?
- Sit down. Sit the fuck down.

994
01:00:34,177 --> 01:00:38,172
- Kat? Are you okay?
- What the fuck is he doing here?

995
01:00:38,173 --> 01:00:40,936
Tell her to put the bag down, Kat.
Tell her.

996
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:43,623
- Vic.
- She's staying with me.

997
01:00:43,624 --> 01:00:46,019
Listen, Kat. Remember
what we talked about.

998
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,337
I can call the police right now
if you want me to.

999
01:00:48,338 --> 01:00:51,576
- Tell her you're staying. Tell her you're staying.
- It'll be okay.

1000
01:00:51,577 --> 01:00:56,559
- Tell 'em to get the fuck out of the house, go
on - Guys just please can you fucking please go

1001
01:00:56,618 --> 01:01:00,228
Cuz I'm, we're gonna work
we're gonna work this out.

1002
01:01:00,229 --> 01:01:03,516
I don't want any fucking trouble,
ok, please?

1003
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:06,560
- Kat.
- Okay?

1004
01:01:07,618 --> 01:01:10,817
You listen to me, Albert.

1005
01:01:10,818 --> 01:01:13,858
YOu hurt her, I'm not your
scared little girlfriend.

1006
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:17,418
- I'll fucking end you.
- Yeah, I ain't fucking scared, okay?

1007
01:01:17,419 --> 01:01:20,191
- You should be.
- Fucking nigger.

1008
01:01:20,192 --> 01:01:23,001
Get the fuck out of my house so I
can fuck my little piece of pussy.

1009
01:01:23,037 --> 01:01:25,018
Call her any name you want to.

1010
01:01:25,019 --> 01:01:29,902
You hit her again, it's gonna
be you and me. You understand me?

1011
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:37,085
- Kat?
- Please, guys, just please go. Please go.

1012
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:41,230
It's gonna be okay.
It's a private matter between us.

1013
01:01:41,231 --> 01:01:43,041
Fuck you!

1014
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,676
Don't fucking make me get up.

1015
01:01:57,701 --> 01:02:01,780
I got married when I was 18, to a guy
who I thought was Prince Charming.

1016
01:02:01,782 --> 01:02:06,160
- But it was a frog, right?
- Right.

1017
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:11,862
He had me fooled for awhile though, God.
I was crazy about the guy.

1018
01:02:11,862 --> 01:02:14,893
You were young.
Maybe you were just crazy.

1019
01:02:14,894 --> 01:02:16,601
Or drunk.

1020
01:02:17,103 --> 01:02:18,318
Probably both.

1021
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:22,119
It was great, it was great
at the beginning, y'know? Great.

1022
01:02:22,703 --> 01:02:28,361
But then, well, he started drinking
and acting just like Al.

1023
01:02:29,743 --> 01:02:35,362
I was 6 months pregnant.
With a girl. Tess.

1024
01:02:36,263 --> 01:02:40,463
He had come home late one night. I don't know,
he was drunk and we started fighting about

1025
01:02:40,464 --> 01:02:44,648
his drinking, or everything,
or nothing.

1026
01:02:46,184 --> 01:02:49,904
And he started hitting me,
and he just would not stop.

1027
01:02:49,905 --> 01:02:52,926
Somehow, I got away and I,
I ran into the hallway screaming

1028
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:55,664
and neighbors called the police.

1029
01:02:55,665 --> 01:02:59,046
Again. and...

1030
01:02:59,047 --> 01:03:03,052
I got to the top of the stairs
and he caught up with me...

1031
01:03:03,705 --> 01:03:06,831
He hit me so hard...

1032
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:11,782
I fell down the stairs and, uh...

1033
01:03:14,425 --> 01:03:16,231
I lost the baby.

1034
01:03:20,506 --> 01:03:24,246
- I'm Sorry.
- Ok

1035
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:30,106
Y'know, I didn't even go home
for my clothes or any of my stuff.

1036
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:35,326
Wouldn't let him come see me
at the hospital. I was so mad.

1037
01:03:42,267 --> 01:03:47,362
Men are dogs. One day we're gonna wake up,
they are gonna start barking.

1038
01:03:47,428 --> 01:03:49,441
Right.

1039
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:57,210
Anyway, I really, I really would like to
help Kat, so, um, if you think of something

1040
01:03:58,909 --> 01:04:02,508
- Anything.
- Yeah...?

1041
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:06,204
- Let me know, alright?
- I will.

1042
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:11,330
You're fucking me. You're fucking only me.
You hear me?

1043
01:04:12,069 --> 01:04:16,731
You fucking, fucking whore! Fucking whore!

1044
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:23,189
- Why don't you say my fucking name?
- Al

1045
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:26,991
- Say it!
- Al!

1046
01:04:46,111 --> 01:04:48,430
What are you suggesting?

1047
01:04:48,432 --> 01:04:50,941
If Kat is not strong
enough to leave Al,

1048
01:04:50,942 --> 01:04:53,958
maybe Al needs to leave Kat.

1049
01:04:53,959 --> 01:04:58,971
- Yeah, he's, uh, he's never gonna do that.
- Maybe not voluntarily.

1050
01:04:59,111 --> 01:05:01,208
What are you saying?

1051
01:05:03,352 --> 01:05:08,173
You look like you play by the rules and
My suggestion is a little bit risky.

1052
01:05:09,872 --> 01:05:14,568
- Well, without risk, there's no reward.
- You're filthy. I love it.

1053
01:05:15,193 --> 01:05:17,294
C'mon, go ahead.

1054
01:05:18,233 --> 01:05:22,312
I'm talking a friend of mine into knocking
Al off and he'll do it for a price.

1055
01:05:22,313 --> 01:05:27,673
Okay, um... wait a minute, wait a minute.
This um... this conversation never happened.

1056
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:30,125
What? He's not that expensive.
We can chip in.

1057
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:33,673
Chip in?
This isn't a fucking dinner.

1058
01:05:33,674 --> 01:05:36,865
You're talking about a murder.
Are you insane?

1059
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:40,976
That is the only way we can get her away
from him so that she can be with me.

1060
01:05:43,994 --> 01:05:46,914
Ah. You're in love with her?

1061
01:05:46,915 --> 01:05:50,634
I'd do anything for her.
I'm crazy about her.

1062
01:05:50,635 --> 01:05:52,764
Or maybe you're just crazy.

1063
01:05:52,765 --> 01:05:55,634
Do you realize you're
talking about a murder?

1064
01:05:55,635 --> 01:05:57,535
You said "no risk, no reward"

1065
01:05:57,536 --> 01:05:58,987
I read that in a fucking book

1066
01:05:58,988 --> 01:06:02,700
or something, okay? I wasn't talking
about killing someone. God!

1067
01:06:03,115 --> 01:06:06,737
YOu met me 2 hours ago and you want
me to be an accomplice to murder.

1068
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,355
Not anymore.

1069
01:06:08,356 --> 01:06:12,217
You, you people in this neighborhood, you
think you're above the law, but you're not.

1070
01:06:14,996 --> 01:06:17,481
This isn't the wild west.

1071
01:06:17,956 --> 01:06:19,965
That's what you think.

1072
01:06:21,257 --> 01:06:22,706
Fuck you!

1073
01:06:22,742 --> 01:06:25,316
Let me see Al!

1074
01:06:25,317 --> 01:06:28,385
I don't think you understand
something, alright?

1075
01:06:28,785 --> 01:06:33,342
I'm not rolling over on him.
You got that?

1076
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:44,140
- Like that?
- It's alright.

1077
01:06:45,597 --> 01:06:51,102
So I thought you were gonna take care of this little
problem of ours. What happen, it backfire on you?

1078
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:53,637
I thought you were
gonna take care of it.

1079
01:06:55,718 --> 01:06:57,608
I'm working on it.

1080
01:07:00,145 --> 01:07:01,726
I like you.

1081
01:07:03,919 --> 01:07:08,156
I like you, too.
For a guy.

1082
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:15,399
Y'know, Big Al was the leading cause of
death in the neighborhood for awhile.

1083
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,319
So you're saying a lot of
people would want him dead?

1084
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:22,982
I'm saying this is a very dangerous
neighboorhood we live in.

1085
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:28,738
- One has to be careful.
- That's exactly what I was thinking.

1086
01:07:30,241 --> 01:07:34,360
Just don't let me hear that you been
talking to Reilly, okay? Or Vic.

1087
01:07:34,361 --> 01:07:36,950
I was gonna say that I love you.

1088
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:38,708
Don't worry, I won't talk to them.

1089
01:07:38,743 --> 01:07:40,360
- Alright, or there'll be trouble, okay?
- Ok

1090
01:07:40,361 --> 01:07:42,421
Gimme a kiss.

1091
01:07:43,961 --> 01:07:46,021
Right.

1092
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,108
We've got 2 hours.

1093
01:08:06,202 --> 01:08:10,081
- We've got 2 hours.
- Oh yeah? Well that's all I need.

1094
01:08:10,082 --> 01:08:14,616
God, I wish I'd have saved
all my first times for you.

1095
01:08:14,617 --> 01:08:18,145
- Really?
- I wish I was a virgin for you, Reilly.

1096
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:19,799
Fuck.

1097
01:08:21,203 --> 01:08:23,037
What?

1098
01:08:23,238 --> 01:08:26,717
I'd do anything
to get away from him.

1099
01:08:26,764 --> 01:08:29,369
I'd do anything
to get rid of him.

1100
01:08:29,370 --> 01:08:32,244
- Anything?
- Yeah, you know that, right?

1101
01:08:32,245 --> 01:08:35,083
I promise you, you come with me,
I'll take care of you, baby, forever.

1102
01:08:35,084 --> 01:08:37,402
You promise me?

1103
01:08:40,524 --> 01:08:45,044
I wish I'd have saved all
my first times for you, Vic.

1104
01:08:45,045 --> 01:08:49,342
God, I wish I was a virgin
for you, Vic. Fuck! why

1105
01:08:49,605 --> 01:08:54,724
I can't take it, Vic. Every time he fucking
touches me, all I can think about is you, Vic.

1106
01:08:54,725 --> 01:08:58,466
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it anymore.

1107
01:08:58,886 --> 01:09:03,309
Kat knew exactly what she was doing.
She was a smart one.

1108
01:09:04,165 --> 01:09:06,325
She liked the numbers.

1109
01:09:06,326 --> 01:09:09,613
Y'know, gambling, taking the risks,
playing the odds.

1110
01:09:11,926 --> 01:09:14,066
If she wanted something for Christmas.

1111
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:17,165
She would tell 4 different people
to get her the exact same thing

1112
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:20,429
cuz she figured one of them
would come through for her.

1113
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,651
And she was right.

1114
01:09:36,608 --> 01:09:38,339
You're the best sex I ever had.

1115
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,085
- Will you get me I want?
- Yes.

1116
01:09:41,086 --> 01:09:45,961
She played everybody.
Like a fucking fiddle.

1117
01:10:02,049 --> 01:10:04,048
Aren't you glad that
everything's back to normal?

1118
01:10:04,049 --> 01:10:06,048
- Yes.
- Y'know?

1119
01:10:06,049 --> 01:10:07,542
Yeah.

1120
01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:15,789
You're always right, Al.
You're always right.

1121
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:19,110
- What's that?
- Huh?

1122
01:10:20,695 --> 01:10:22,341
What?

1123
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:29,663
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1124
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:36,010
Listen, I want to take you to that, uh...
I don't wanna come back here after dinner,

1125
01:10:36,011 --> 01:10:39,050
I wanna take you to some fancy
place, y'know? Take you out.

1126
01:10:39,051 --> 01:10:43,770
No. What do you mean? Wait, but you
were gonna stay here and cook dinner and

1127
01:10:43,771 --> 01:10:45,771
- Nonononono I wanna take you to that fancy
- baked beans...

1128
01:10:45,772 --> 01:10:47,770
French restaurant, y'know the one
with the snails and shit.

1129
01:10:47,771 --> 01:10:50,367
-Hey, Al...

1130
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,411
- Hey, Al
- Where's my coat?

1131
01:10:52,412 --> 01:10:54,270
You know...

1132
01:10:54,648 --> 01:11:00,237
I got this new uh, got this new uh
prison fantasy I've been working on

1133
01:11:00,492 --> 01:11:04,371
And I really, uh, wanted to
try it out on you.

1134
01:11:04,372 --> 01:11:07,972
- Would you like that?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1135
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:11,168
Not as much as I would.

1136
01:11:11,693 --> 01:11:13,932
- Okay, I'd like that.
- Yeah?

1137
01:11:14,884 --> 01:11:15,933
Ok

1138
01:11:15,934 --> 01:11:17,486
Where's my coat?

1139
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:22,052
- Well don't wear the, uh...
- The Big Al coat, where is it?

1140
01:11:22,053 --> 01:11:25,013
Don't wear the Big Al coat, I got you
a new coat. Where is your new coat?

1141
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:26,618
I want the Big Al coat.

1142
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:29,806
Why? I got you... there it is,
I got you a beautiful new coat.

1143
01:11:29,807 --> 01:11:32,735
Come on, baby. For me?

1144
01:11:35,134 --> 01:11:37,253
Ok

1145
01:11:37,254 --> 01:11:40,223
Al's problem is
he never thought big.

1146
01:11:40,224 --> 01:11:41,894
He was strictly small time.

1147
01:11:41,895 --> 01:11:44,494
But he met his match
when he met Kat.

1148
01:11:44,495 --> 01:11:49,536
Oh, I tellya.
That's a smart cookie. Tough!

1149
01:11:49,575 --> 01:11:52,648
There was a period in her life
when every guy she went out with...

1150
01:11:52,648 --> 01:11:55,886
changed his name to plaintiff
in the first 3 weeks.

1151
01:11:55,887 --> 01:11:57,952
Am I right?

1152
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:20,319
I really want to change this time,
Father.

1153
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:24,867
I'm so sick and tired
of being mean to my girl.

1154
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:28,299
I just, I wanna be,
I wanna be a good man, y'know?

1155
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:30,785
But I'm telling you.

1156
01:13:30,786 --> 01:13:35,991
I just have this problem keeping it in
my pants even when I'm in church praying

1157
01:13:35,992 --> 01:13:39,380
every time I see a pretty girl
walk up the aisle I just wanna

1158
01:13:39,381 --> 01:13:43,885
- crawl up underneath her skirt, and...
- What do you do?

1159
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:49,821
- Well, I go back to praying, y'know?
- It's good that you're trying.

1160
01:13:49,822 --> 01:13:53,221
- How do you think I feel?
- What are you saying?

1161
01:13:53,222 --> 01:13:57,755
I have a line of women who stand
in front of me, and get on their knees.

1162
01:13:57,791 --> 01:14:01,101
And open their mouth,
and stick out their tongue

1163
01:14:01,102 --> 01:14:04,797
and look up at me and go "Ah".

1164
01:14:06,062 --> 01:14:09,462
- What do you do?
- I go back to praying.

1165
01:14:09,463 --> 01:14:13,062
That's fucked up. How can you say
this? How can you think like this?

1166
01:14:13,063 --> 01:14:18,222
These poor girls are
coming to you for hope and you

1167
01:14:18,223 --> 01:14:23,210
want them to suck your cock.
You fucking disgust me.

1168
01:14:23,211 --> 01:14:27,468
I'm just a man, Al
with a collar and a cock.

1169
01:14:28,865 --> 01:14:33,719
- Oh, you're gonna burn in hell.
- I'm no better than you, no worse.

1170
01:14:36,025 --> 01:14:40,243
You're weak. I fucking hate weakness!

1171
01:14:47,185 --> 01:14:51,049
You disappoint me, man!

1172
01:14:55,025 --> 01:14:59,505
Stay away from the kids, okay?

1173
01:15:00,586 --> 01:15:02,625
- That's him!
- Hands up, pal.

1174
01:15:02,626 --> 01:15:04,625
Right there! Get him!

1175
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:06,625
Get your fucking hands up!

1176
01:15:06,626 --> 01:15:08,814
- Fuck you!
- What the fuck are you doing, Al!

1177
01:15:08,815 --> 01:15:10,274
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1178
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:13,145
- Stay there, man!
- What the fuck you doing out here now?

1179
01:15:13,146 --> 01:15:17,111
You're under arrest for
the murder of Clancy O'Hara.

1180
01:15:19,787 --> 01:15:21,889
Don't you move!

1181
01:15:23,255 --> 01:15:25,870
- You're not going nowhere.
- Fuck you!

1182
01:15:25,872 --> 01:15:28,665
I didn't fucking do it!
It's a fucking mistake!

1183
01:15:28,666 --> 01:15:31,085
Get the fuck off me!

1184
01:15:31,087 --> 01:15:34,995
- Fuck off.
- Get in there!

1185
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:39,694
You're not fucking going nowhere!

1186
01:15:39,729 --> 01:15:41,270
Fuck you!

1187
01:15:42,861 --> 01:15:44,533
Get in the fucking car!

1188
01:15:46,599 --> 01:15:49,468
- C'mon, watch your fucking head
- Fuck you!

1189
01:15:49,469 --> 01:15:54,873
Al, he should've done something with his
life. I mean, he was always in trouble.

1190
01:15:54,908 --> 01:15:57,184
So I figured:
"If you're always gonna be in trouble,

1191
01:15:57,184 --> 01:15:59,499
then you do something to
make your mom proud of ya!"

1192
01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:04,349
You rob a bank, you rob a gas station,
y'know, something to write home about.

1193
01:16:04,349 --> 01:16:06,349
You want people to respect ya?

1194
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:08,733
Then you gotta do something
to make 'em respect ya.

1195
01:16:08,734 --> 01:16:11,949
Who cares if
they fucking like ya?

1196
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:15,986
Now, if they fear ya,
then that's something.

1197
01:16:15,987 --> 01:16:19,179
Make the headlines. Am I right?

1198
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:27,209
I can't believe we
finally got rid of him.

1199
01:16:28,991 --> 01:16:32,172
No one can
connect you to this, right?

1200
01:16:33,991 --> 01:16:36,688
You're dangerous, huh?

1201
01:16:36,951 --> 01:16:41,894
You know I like that.
Never know what you're gonna do.

1202
01:16:44,152 --> 01:16:47,630
There's nothing sexier
than being afraid.

1203
01:16:50,292 --> 01:16:52,280
God.

1204
01:16:53,169 --> 01:16:57,052
If I knew I was gonna meet you, I
would've saved all my first times for you.

1205
01:16:57,952 --> 01:17:00,843
You're the best sex I ever had.

1206
01:17:06,953 --> 01:17:10,009
Let me find a way to pay you back.

1207
01:17:17,514 --> 01:17:22,070
Kat... she's a doll.

1208
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:24,053
A real cunt.

1209
01:17:24,088 --> 01:17:26,542
And I mean that in the
nicest possible way.

1210
01:17:26,578 --> 01:17:31,074
- You hear anything on the street?
- No, nobody heard a thing.

1211
01:17:31,075 --> 01:17:35,313
I want you to talk to Clancy's mother,
okay? Find out who was after him.

1212
01:17:35,314 --> 01:17:38,034
Reilly doesn't know anything? Hm?

1213
01:17:38,035 --> 01:17:43,614
Why don't you tell him to get his ass in gear.
I need to get the fuck out of here right now.

1214
01:17:44,155 --> 01:17:46,755
What are you so worried about?
They don't have any evidence.

1215
01:17:46,756 --> 01:17:50,155
Kat, they got my fingerprints
all over the fucking gun, alright?

1216
01:17:50,156 --> 01:17:54,475
- How?
- I don't know.

1217
01:17:54,476 --> 01:17:57,195
My lawyer says
the good thing is that...

1218
01:17:57,196 --> 01:17:59,795
I got proof that I wasn't anywhere
near Clancy's house that night, right?

1219
01:17:59,796 --> 01:18:02,075
I got you.

1220
01:18:02,076 --> 01:18:05,082
But I just don't get it,
cuz the guy who lives downstairs

1221
01:18:05,083 --> 01:18:07,459
He says he sees me running
out the fucking building

1222
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:09,602
at 10:45 right after
he hears the gunshot.

1223
01:18:09,603 --> 01:18:12,945
He said he knows it's me because
he sees the Big Al jacket, right?

1224
01:18:12,946 --> 01:18:15,201
But I lost that fucking
jacket, what? Weeks ago.

1225
01:18:15,202 --> 01:18:16,556
Anyone could be fucking
wearing that thing.

1226
01:18:16,557 --> 01:18:18,091
I don't fucking get it.
YOu follow me?

1227
01:18:18,092 --> 01:18:20,136
Was Clancy killed with
the gun I sold?

1228
01:18:20,137 --> 01:18:21,825
No.

1229
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:27,036
He was killed with the fucking
.45 that's registered in my name.

1230
01:18:27,037 --> 01:18:32,398
- I don't understand.
- Somebody's fucking with me. Okay?

1231
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:35,307
- Who?
- I don't know.

1232
01:18:35,342 --> 01:18:39,298
Somebody who knows us.

1233
01:18:39,358 --> 01:18:43,318
- Are you accusing me?
- No... I don't know

1234
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:46,457
I mean I don't know
what the fuck I'm saying.

1235
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:48,453
The good thing is I got
you as my proof, okay?

1236
01:18:48,454 --> 01:18:50,878
- You're my alibi.
- What proof, Al?

1237
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:53,438
- Where were you that night?
- What do you mean?

1238
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,737
- Where were you that night?
- Well, I was with you.

1239
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:01,998
We were at home, sitting there,
playing cards, watching TV, remember?

1240
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,679
YOu didn't want to go out that night.
We came back after the movie.

1241
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:08,264
I made baked beans with
toast and a tuna melt for me.

1242
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:11,382
What?

1243
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:14,207
I don't remember.

1244
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:20,245
Alright, don't fucking, just don't fucking play
games with me, Kat. You're my fucking alibi here.

1245
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,439
I'm getting all
mixed up with the dates.

1246
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:29,243
- I was with you.
- No. I was with a friend.

1247
01:19:29,522 --> 01:19:35,503
And he would swear on a stack of
Bibles. He's a very religious man.

1248
01:19:35,641 --> 01:19:40,064
- You wouldn't do this to me, Kat.
- Betcha?

1249
01:19:40,162 --> 01:19:45,381
- Betcha?
- It's not too fucking late for us.

1250
01:19:45,762 --> 01:19:51,719
- Please. Just... please.
- Don't beg.

1251
01:19:51,753 --> 01:19:55,844
You... you...

1252
01:19:55,845 --> 01:19:57,757
pussy.

1253
01:19:57,792 --> 01:20:01,446
I'll fucking kill you.
I'll fucking kill you you fucking cunt!

1254
01:20:01,447 --> 01:20:07,033
- Sit the fuck down like the dog you are, sit down.
- You'll be fucking sorry.

1255
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:11,963
You listen to me,
because I'm in control now.

1256
01:20:11,964 --> 01:20:14,680
And the way I look at it is:

1257
01:20:15,181 --> 01:20:20,593
hips, lips, tits.

1258
01:20:20,628 --> 01:20:23,331
A whole woman.

1259
01:20:24,245 --> 01:20:29,669
What are you talking about? What the fuck?
Who the fuck have you been talking to?

1260
01:20:29,684 --> 01:20:32,131
- I want you to listen to me, Al.
- I'll kill you.

1261
01:20:32,132 --> 01:20:35,027
- Listen to me, good.
- I'll kill you, baby.

1262
01:20:35,565 --> 01:20:39,633
You're making me very angry
and you don't want that.

1263
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:45,221
Because I have the power.

1264
01:20:45,255 --> 01:20:50,482
And you will rot
in this motherfucker

1265
01:20:50,483 --> 01:20:52,565
If I want you to.

1266
01:20:52,566 --> 01:20:55,405
Do you understand me, Al?
Do you?

1267
01:20:55,406 --> 01:20:59,285
You set me up, right?
You set me up.

1268
01:20:59,286 --> 01:21:02,566
- Don't be so dramatic.
- You and Vic, right? Okay,

1269
01:21:02,567 --> 01:21:06,898
you and Vic, fuck. Right?

1270
01:21:06,899 --> 01:21:10,633
Wrong. Wrong.

1271
01:21:11,207 --> 01:21:15,592
Not you and Reilly.
You didn't...

1272
01:21:15,592 --> 01:21:18,613
Tell me you didn't fuck him, okay?

1273
01:21:18,647 --> 01:21:23,807
Just tell me you didn't... tell me he didn't
fucking ask you to suck his fucking cock!

1274
01:21:23,808 --> 01:21:26,232
He didn't have to, Al.

1275
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:30,584
I volunteered.

1276
01:21:32,449 --> 01:21:35,447
- Oh, Kat. You wouldn't do this to me.
- Al...

1277
01:21:35,448 --> 01:21:38,926
Thanks for the haircut.

1278
01:21:39,688 --> 01:21:42,092
It's a whole new me.

1279
01:21:42,127 --> 01:21:44,408
- So how'd you do it?
- What?

1280
01:21:44,409 --> 01:21:47,928
- Set up Al?
- I didn't.

1281
01:21:47,929 --> 01:21:51,649
Come on. I know
you were in on it with Kat.

1282
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:53,459
I wasn't.

1283
01:21:55,810 --> 01:22:01,409
- Have you, uh, slept with her recently?
- No, have you?

1284
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:05,150
- Nah.
- Bitch.

1285
01:22:05,410 --> 01:22:10,630
- But you still want her bad, though, don't you?
- To tell the truth...

1286
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:12,295
She's too much trouble.

1287
01:22:12,296 --> 01:22:15,526
After all this,
I could never trust her.

1288
01:22:16,131 --> 01:22:18,375
I'd be looking behind
my back the whole time.

1289
01:22:19,644 --> 01:22:21,702
She scares me.

1290
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,388
I think I should be with
somebody more like you.

1291
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:28,365
Really?

1292
01:22:28,401 --> 01:22:30,012
Yeah.

1293
01:22:31,092 --> 01:22:35,171
I don't think I've ever talked to a woman as much
as I have with you and it not end up in bed.

1294
01:22:35,172 --> 01:22:36,744
You know?

1295
01:22:36,745 --> 01:22:40,274
If you're lucky, Reilly, you might
have a lot of first times with me.

1296
01:22:41,212 --> 01:22:45,172
- This isn't a game, is it?
- I don't play games.

1297
01:22:45,173 --> 01:22:50,108
- Play pool.
- This could be a whole new approach.

1298
01:22:51,213 --> 01:22:56,705
Becoming friends first
and then, y'know, fucking.

1299
01:23:00,134 --> 01:23:03,532
- Hey, you got some nice legs, Vic?
- Yeah, you like those?

1300
01:23:03,533 --> 01:23:05,977
Yeah. I do.

1301
01:23:06,578 --> 01:23:08,442
I really do.

1302
01:23:08,494 --> 01:23:12,253
You play your cards right, they can be
wrapped around your back in 10 minutes.

1303
01:23:12,254 --> 01:23:15,916
- What would I have to do?
- Don't say a word.

1304
01:23:15,950 --> 01:23:17,843
I'm mute.

1305
01:23:30,935 --> 01:23:34,555
- What was that about?
- What?

1306
01:23:35,575 --> 01:23:40,230
Oh. Look, you didn't cure me.
I'm not sick.

1307
01:23:41,655 --> 01:23:45,815
I'll always swing both ways,
and I got a soft spot for redheads.

1308
01:23:45,816 --> 01:23:47,989
So do I.

1309
01:23:58,816 --> 01:24:03,798
- How was that?
- It was alright.

1310
01:24:04,777 --> 01:24:08,376
- Let's get outta here.
- Ok

1311
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:30,776
So, you wanna get your stuff?

1312
01:24:30,812 --> 01:24:34,882
- And take it over to my place?
- No.

1313
01:24:35,979 --> 01:24:39,738
No? Uh, what do you mean?

1314
01:24:39,739 --> 01:24:41,911
No.

1315
01:24:43,499 --> 01:24:48,257
I thought that with Al out of the
way, that we would be together.

1316
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:49,720
Did I say that?

1317
01:24:50,424 --> 01:24:53,455
You didn't have to say that.
Your body said that.

1318
01:24:56,459 --> 01:25:00,089
Okay. I get it. I get it.

1319
01:25:00,090 --> 01:25:03,861
You got what you wanted and
now you're gonna play me.

1320
01:25:03,897 --> 01:25:08,335
- So, who is it? Is it Vic? Is it Reilly?
- No, it's not like that, okay?

1321
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:13,246
It's none of them.
I need to be alone. You understand?

1322
01:25:14,661 --> 01:25:19,517
So, after all of...
everything I did for you

1323
01:25:21,421 --> 01:25:25,181
- All I get is a kiss?
- What, what happened to you?

1324
01:25:25,182 --> 01:25:29,100
What about all that shit?
Hips, tits, lips, all woman? Power?

1325
01:25:29,101 --> 01:25:31,369
- Use it?
- You stop it!

1326
01:25:31,405 --> 01:25:35,875
You do not throw my fucking
words back in my face! You used me!

1327
01:25:35,982 --> 01:25:38,421
I didn't take anything
from you, okay?

1328
01:25:38,422 --> 01:25:41,102
You told me I could trust you,
that you didn't need anything from me

1329
01:25:41,103 --> 01:25:43,742
And in the end, you treated me
just like everybody else, alright?

1330
01:25:43,743 --> 01:25:47,501
YOu got what you needed.
You took from me.

1331
01:25:47,502 --> 01:25:50,565
So don't play the victim.

1332
01:25:54,023 --> 01:25:56,084
Fuck you!

1333
01:25:56,700 --> 01:25:58,478
Fuck you!

1334
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:02,203
YOu don't have to fucking throw
people away like this! You don't do this!

1335
01:26:18,504 --> 01:26:21,281
Hey, what's up with the ketchup?

1336
01:26:29,185 --> 01:26:33,184
Big Al was a great fuck.
I mean, it was great

1337
01:26:33,185 --> 01:26:36,024
Until it wasn't.
Don't get me wrong,

1338
01:26:36,026 --> 01:26:39,845
when we first started going out,
it was exciting, y'know, dangerous

1339
01:26:39,846 --> 01:26:44,822
He was funny, sexy, wild,
made me feel safe. Protected.

1340
01:26:45,146 --> 01:26:48,186
But he couldn't
protect me from himself.

1341
01:26:48,187 --> 01:26:53,350
Big Al could've gotten me almost anything in
the world, but "almost" isn't good enough.

1342
01:26:53,707 --> 01:26:59,171
Y'know, life is like sex. If you want
done right, you gotta do it yourself.

1343
01:27:01,027 --> 01:27:02,519
Going out with Big Al ..

1344
01:27:03,221 --> 01:27:07,145
Made me realize that the
best feeling in the world...

1345
01:27:07,587 --> 01:27:11,088
is taking care of number one.

1346
01:27:11,228 --> 01:27:13,850
And that's me.
