1
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:12,712
- Yo, man!

2
00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:13,710
- Beaker!

3
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,793
- Elliot, you owe me one.

4
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:18,520
- Hey what's up?

5
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,077
- Brad, how you doing?

6
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:48,540
Hey.

7
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:50,267
- Hey.

8
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:56,713
- So how've you been?

9
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:01,688
- I'm good. How you been?

10
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,229
- Good; I got a job.

11
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:04,233
- A real one?

12
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:05,066
- Yeah.

13
00:02:05,066 --> 00:02:05,899
- Yeah?

14
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:10,972
- Yeah, just a gig at a print
shop; a friend hooked me up.

15
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:14,529
- How's that going?

16
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:17,204
- I hate it.

17
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,037
- Figures.

18
00:02:26,173 --> 00:02:30,099
I'm just gonna sit here
as long as you talk to me.

19
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:33,347
- Can we just not make this weird?

20
00:02:33,347 --> 00:02:35,599
- I'm not making it weird.

21
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,402
- Just wanna stick... to
small conversation, okay?

22
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:41,397
Just small talk.

23
00:02:41,397 --> 00:02:43,937
- Well I fucking hate small talk.

24
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:45,086
- Guess what, I fucking hate not knowing

25
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:46,473
what to say to you, so.

26
00:02:46,473 --> 00:02:49,274
- No one's forcing you
to say anything, so.

27
00:02:49,274 --> 00:02:53,846
- You just want me to sit
here, not talk to you?

28
00:02:53,846 --> 00:02:57,679
- It's an option; we all
have options in life.

29
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:03,996
- I was gonna talk to you earlier.

30
00:03:05,096 --> 00:03:06,869
Me being me, I didn't know what to say.

31
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,344
I didn't even know you
were gonna be here tonight.

32
00:03:13,344 --> 00:03:14,177
- Liar.

33
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:22,769
- Boggles

34
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:25,142
- What?

35
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:25,975
- Boggles.

36
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,341
Nothing.

37
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:35,170
I mean, what if the world
doesn't end tonight, you know?

38
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,587
I don't know, I hope it does.

39
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:41,404
Be a real big inconvenience
just to have to wake up

40
00:03:41,404 --> 00:03:43,321
and face reality again.

41
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,959
To regret all the shit you said.

42
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:51,090
- There's nothing wrong with regret.

43
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,531
Yeah there is: it's a waste of time.

44
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,404
- People should be able to regret

45
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:56,737
whatever the fuck they want.

46
00:04:03,126 --> 00:04:06,126
- You know we can't just start over.

47
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,723
- Yeah.

48
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:17,771
- Wouldn't want to even if we could.

49
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:23,014
What happened, happened.

50
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:25,304
- Yeah.

51
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:32,008
- What now?

52
00:04:34,472 --> 00:04:35,889
- Fuck if I know.

53
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:40,971
- You okay with that?

54
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:43,264
- Yeah.

55
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:48,941
- Okay.

56
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,193
- Okay.

57
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:41,161
- Babe, why are you calling?

58
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,492
You know I'm at work.

59
00:05:43,492 --> 00:05:44,409
- I forgot.

60
00:05:46,357 --> 00:05:48,751
- I was just, uh, finishing this up.

61
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:49,915
- Are you on the phone?

62
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:50,748
- No.

63
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:54,997
- It looks like
you're on the phone.

64
00:05:54,997 --> 00:05:56,414
- Eddie, go away.

65
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,094
- I just don't want Hannover
finding out, you know?

66
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:02,427
- I won't tell if you don't.

67
00:06:06,671 --> 00:06:07,994
- Who are you talking to?

68
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,850
- It's just Eddie.

69
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,517
- Who?

70
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:15,496
- No one. You should
finish cleaning your room.

71
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:18,764
- I don't know, I kinda like it.

72
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:19,954
- You going to Amsterdam?

73
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:22,526
- If I get any calls, then yeah.

74
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:24,659
Right now I'm just...

75
00:06:24,659 --> 00:06:27,146
Doing some organizing.

76
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:28,310
- Well I still
have a couple more hours

77
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,302
before my leaves,
so can I just call you later?

78
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:33,135
- Okee-doke, love you.

79
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:35,850
- Love you more.

80
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:36,683
Bye.

81
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:44,514
- We have breaking news for you now.

82
00:06:44,514 --> 00:06:47,739
The body of an unidentified
young male was found last night

83
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:49,422
near Belmont and Halsted.

84
00:06:49,422 --> 00:06:51,222
This is believed to be another victim

85
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:52,659
of the Boystown Butcher.

86
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:55,881
A neighbor, walking their dog,
found the man unresponsive

87
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,782
and face down in an alley.

88
00:06:57,782 --> 00:07:00,307
He had been stabbed in the
upper and lower abdomen.

89
00:07:00,307 --> 00:07:03,807
- Can you believe another
kid died last night?

90
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:05,656
- No, it's fucked up.

91
00:07:05,656 --> 00:07:07,687
- It is the
fifth unsolved murder

92
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:08,520
in the Boystown neighborhood.

93
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,353
- That's like, what,
the fourth since June?

94
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:11,646
- Autopsy results are pending,

95
00:07:11,646 --> 00:07:12,479
- Hey turn that shit off; it's depressing.

96
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,442
- but police
think the stab pattern

97
00:07:13,442 --> 00:07:15,221
is identical to the
string of other murders.

98
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:16,054
- Later.

99
00:07:16,054 --> 00:07:18,804
- Paul, you are beautiful!

100
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:25,459
- Found you some goodies,
from the Oasis Grocery Store.

101
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,405
You're welcome.

102
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:30,900
- Did you steal these?

103
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,452
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,642
- Why do you do that?

105
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:35,559
You're gonna get fired.

106
00:07:39,494 --> 00:07:40,744
- Where's Brad?

107
00:07:41,848 --> 00:07:43,931
- Um, Alison's, probably.

108
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:46,956
- Sorry about this, but it's something

109
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:49,873
we're both gonna have to deal with.

110
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:56,054
- I got a call, I'm going to Pilsen.

111
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:01,465
What?

112
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:05,499
- Nothing, I just hate that
you go out there alone.

113
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:07,618
- Why don't you come with me?

114
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:09,685
- Why don't you not be a drug dealer?

115
00:08:09,685 --> 00:08:13,852
- What so I can work 40 hours
a week and barely make rent?

116
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:21,138
- Didn't another guy get
killed over there last night?

117
00:08:21,138 --> 00:08:24,221
- It's Chicago; people die every day.

118
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:33,415
- I wanna come with you tonight.

119
00:08:34,477 --> 00:08:36,164
- I'll be fine.

120
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:37,997
- Okay, I believe you.

121
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:42,309
I just wanna get out and stretch my legs.

122
00:08:43,425 --> 00:08:45,588
- Okay, but they're gonna think it's weird

123
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:48,888
if you don't smoke; it's offensive.

124
00:08:48,888 --> 00:08:50,501
- Okay, well if it's your
image you're worried about,

125
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:54,440
I'll try my best to make you look good.

126
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,574
- I just don't want you
freaking out like last time.

127
00:08:57,574 --> 00:08:58,996
- That was a one-time thing.

128
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,622
- Yeah, one time?

129
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:01,855
- Yeah, one time.

130
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:03,089
- Yeah, we had to call the cops,

131
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:04,903
and they found you in an attic, naked,

132
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:06,505
hugging a Christmas tree.

133
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,698
- It was hot in that attic.

134
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:09,584
- Yeah, I know it was hot in that attic.

135
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:14,402
- Okay, I'll be good.

136
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:15,235
- Promise?

137
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:16,068
- Mm-hmm.

138
00:09:16,068 --> 00:09:16,901
- Pinky swear?

139
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:18,901
- Pinky swears, kiss it.

140
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:33,325
- Hey, I got 20; is that all right?

141
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:35,825
- Yeah, let's see what we got.

142
00:09:37,592 --> 00:09:38,425
There you go.

143
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:39,258
- Thank you very much.

144
00:09:39,258 --> 00:09:40,341
- No problem.

145
00:09:51,977 --> 00:09:53,863
- You're fine, you're fine.

146
00:09:53,863 --> 00:09:55,300
We're all good, we're good in here.

147
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,867
Everything's fine, we're
having a good time.

148
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:58,784
Having a really good...

149
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:04,971
Good, huh?

150
00:10:43,194 --> 00:10:45,577
- Tasty; what do you call this?

151
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:46,744
- Solar Flare.

152
00:10:48,044 --> 00:10:49,225
That's what I'm told.

153
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:50,763
- Catchy.

154
00:10:50,763 --> 00:10:52,870
I used to buy from this
one guy down the street.

155
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,703
He sold Hemp Hash, aka Very Berry.

156
00:10:57,464 --> 00:10:59,789
- So you're telling me he's
a pothead with an alias.

157
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:01,272
- Yeah, you know, just in
case you didn't like one name,

158
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:02,680
you could call it the other.

159
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,059
- Sounds like a douche bag to me.

160
00:11:06,224 --> 00:11:08,241
- Where'd your friend go?

161
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:10,522
- Uh, my boyfriend?

162
00:11:10,522 --> 00:11:11,522
- He's cute.

163
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:16,068
- Thanks; I think he's in the bathroom.

164
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:19,508
- Everything's two-dimensional.

165
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:24,912
- So where're you from?

166
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:26,192
- Around.

167
00:11:26,192 --> 00:11:27,192
- Around...?

168
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,737
- I don't give out my address to customers

169
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:32,551
or strangers, sorry.

170
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:35,991
- I'm not a stranger, I haven't
bought anything yet, so.

171
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:37,645
- Not yet.

172
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:39,312
- So can I call you?

173
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:43,813
- I'm pretty busy.

174
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:46,559
- Are you turning me down?

175
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:51,420
- All right, put your number in my phone.

176
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,890
I'll text you later so
that way you get mine.

177
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,390
- Okay, oh, Kevin.

178
00:11:57,321 --> 00:11:58,699
- Kurt.

179
00:11:58,699 --> 00:11:59,949
- There you go.

180
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:08,967
- Be right back.

181
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:10,217
- I'll be here.

182
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,232
- Paul?

183
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:18,228
Paul, I know you're in there.

184
00:12:31,992 --> 00:12:32,825
Paul.

185
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:35,222
- Hi.

186
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,522
I wasn't sure you were gonna make it here.

187
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:42,368
I thought, "he's gonna get lost."

188
00:12:42,368 --> 00:12:43,701
But you're here!

189
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,088
I'm good!

190
00:12:46,088 --> 00:12:48,050
- You're freaking out.

191
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:50,204
- I hate this.

192
00:12:53,536 --> 00:12:56,279
I don't know why I do this.

193
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,067
- It's all in your head,
babe, don't worry about it.

194
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:02,072
- I feel like an idiot.

195
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,739
- I think it's cute.

196
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:09,680
- I want a drink.

197
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,206
- Yeah?

198
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:13,386
You want a drink?

199
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:16,787
All right, we'll get some
booze on the way home.

200
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:17,620
Can you get up?

201
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,453
Ready to go?

202
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:19,286
- Mmm.

203
00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:20,119
- Yeah?

204
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,751
I have to call 911 again?

205
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:25,944
Good, come on, let's head out of here.

206
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:27,917
- I can't go out there like this.

207
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:28,750
- It's fine.

208
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,740
- They're gonna see me.

209
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,323
- I'm done, it's fine, come on.

210
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:36,627
We can sneak out the back way, okay?

211
00:13:36,627 --> 00:13:39,044
- I'm high as a motherfucker.

212
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:55,551
Thanks for taking care of me, baby.

213
00:13:57,121 --> 00:13:59,121
- You're welcome, kiddo.

214
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:37,832
- Mm!

215
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:39,315
Asshole.

216
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:40,348
- Wake up!

217
00:14:40,348 --> 00:14:41,799
- Mm-mm.

218
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,166
- Let's go to the beach.

219
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:43,999
- Mm-mm.

220
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:48,138
- Come on.

221
00:14:50,331 --> 00:14:52,099
- Mm, I'm still high.

222
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:52,932
- Let's go.

223
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:53,765
- Mm-mm.

224
00:14:57,871 --> 00:14:58,704
- Hey!

225
00:14:58,704 --> 00:14:59,537
- No.

226
00:14:59,537 --> 00:15:00,370
- Hey!

227
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:02,350
Fucker!

228
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,175
- Little bitch.

229
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:07,461
- All right, come on, let's go.

230
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:16,357
- Little soda?

231
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:19,811
All right, you're good, you're good.

232
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:20,894
Can you stop?

233
00:15:22,552 --> 00:15:25,769
Don't do it, don't, don't do it, stop.

234
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:35,591
- Who're you looking at?

235
00:15:36,596 --> 00:15:37,429
- No one.

236
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:41,210
- Ah, you're looking at someone.

237
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:44,867
- Over there, yellow shorts.

238
00:15:49,094 --> 00:15:49,927
- Black?

239
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:52,379
- Yeah.

240
00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:55,015
What, don't you ever
wonder what it'd be like

241
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:56,908
to do a black guy?

242
00:15:56,908 --> 00:16:00,658
- Uh, nope, not really,
I'm in love with you.

243
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:04,909
- You're telling me that you
don't look at other people?

244
00:16:04,909 --> 00:16:05,768
- What is this?

245
00:16:05,768 --> 00:16:07,425
- It's a question.

246
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,776
- Yeah I look at other guys.

247
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:11,868
- Okay, is there anyone on
this beach you find attractive?

248
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:14,237
Besides me, of course.

249
00:16:14,237 --> 00:16:16,068
- Is this a test?

250
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:18,883
- No, Paul, I just
wanna know what you're into.

251
00:16:18,883 --> 00:16:20,133
- I'm into you.

252
00:16:21,234 --> 00:16:23,005
- Okay, so then pretend I'm not

253
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:25,289
the greatest boyfriend on the planet.

254
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:26,122
- Done.

255
00:16:27,538 --> 00:16:31,288
- Tell me who you'd
settle for on this beach.

256
00:16:37,903 --> 00:16:38,736
Come on.

257
00:16:38,736 --> 00:16:40,819
- That guy, green shorts.

258
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,598
- Ugh, the guido?

259
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:44,747
- He is not a guido.

260
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:46,140
- Paul, he's a guido.

261
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,904
- Okay, if you're just gonna
make fun of me, then he's ugly.

262
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:50,281
- Is that what you want?

263
00:16:50,281 --> 00:16:52,588
- You're being stupid right now.

264
00:16:52,588 --> 00:16:54,576
- I don't see how I can compete with that.

265
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:57,537
- You don't have to
compete with anyone; I'm yours.

266
00:16:57,537 --> 00:16:59,484
- I mean he's got those
arms, and that tan.

267
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:01,618
- Oh shit, yeah, you're right.

268
00:17:01,618 --> 00:17:04,633
- Me, I'm just extremely
intelligent, savvy, and personable.

269
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:09,219
- Yeah, modestly drunk,
yep, you got 'em all, babe.

270
00:17:09,219 --> 00:17:10,052
- Yeah.

271
00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:16,016
- We should go somewhere.

272
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,670
- Where do you wanna go?

273
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:22,428
- Like Paris.

274
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:26,667
- I was thinking more along the lines of

275
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:29,282
that ice cream hut over there, but okay.

276
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:30,559
- I'm serious.

277
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,476
- So was I.

278
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:35,441
- Just you and me in a foreign country,

279
00:17:35,441 --> 00:17:37,374
I don't know, doing whatever.

280
00:17:37,374 --> 00:17:39,525
- We can do whatever here.

281
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,192
- It's not the same.

282
00:17:43,536 --> 00:17:45,004
Well don't you ever get
tired of the same old thing

283
00:17:45,004 --> 00:17:46,978
over and over?

284
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:48,159
- No?

285
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:50,145
- Okay, well I do.

286
00:17:50,145 --> 00:17:50,978
What do we do?

287
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:53,196
All we ever do is we go to work,

288
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:55,613
we drink, we smoke, we sleep.

289
00:17:57,865 --> 00:17:58,698
- So what?

290
00:17:58,698 --> 00:18:01,692
I like my job, I like drinking.

291
00:18:01,692 --> 00:18:03,102
- So you're happy?

292
00:18:03,102 --> 00:18:05,685
- I'd say so, yeah, aren't you?

293
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,434
- Yeah, I don't know, I
just think it'd be fun

294
00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:13,601
to do something different, that's all.

295
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:19,820
- I'm toasty.

296
00:18:22,156 --> 00:18:26,323
- My mom says toasty; you're
turning into my mother.

297
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:30,570
- Come on, let's go swimming.

298
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:33,525
- Okay, help me up.

299
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:34,358
- Let's go!

300
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:36,025
- My handsome steed.

301
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,112
- Hey.

302
00:18:53,154 --> 00:18:53,987
- Hey.

303
00:18:55,317 --> 00:18:56,846
- You look tired.

304
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:58,929
- Got a little something.

305
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,463
- Are you drunk?

306
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:04,212
- No, why?

307
00:19:10,086 --> 00:19:12,003
- You smell like booze.

308
00:19:14,392 --> 00:19:16,100
- I don't smell anything.

309
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,517
- I can smell it.

310
00:19:18,744 --> 00:19:19,911
- Okay, Eddie.

311
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,095
- You're supposed to use
the cone when you do that.

312
00:19:24,095 --> 00:19:26,012
Someone could get hurt.

313
00:19:31,739 --> 00:19:32,855
- Thank you so much for taking me, dude,

314
00:19:32,855 --> 00:19:35,257
this place is so good.

315
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,174
- Love you.

316
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,122
- Try some of this.

317
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:40,955
- Mm-mm.

318
00:19:40,955 --> 00:19:41,788
- Come on, try.

319
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:43,656
- No, no, no.

320
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:44,489
Why do you always do that?

321
00:19:44,489 --> 00:19:46,692
Why do you always try
to feed me your food?

322
00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:49,188
If I wanted shrimp, I
would've order shrimp.

323
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,599
I don't like it.

324
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,297
- Okay, why not?

325
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:53,809
- Because I don't.

326
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:55,176
Why don't you like smoking weed?

327
00:19:55,176 --> 00:19:57,009
- Because it's stupid.

328
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:00,853
- Okay, how about this:
you take a bong hit,

329
00:20:00,853 --> 00:20:03,020
and I'll try some of that.

330
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,679
- That's not a fair trade-off.

331
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,004
- Well I think it is,
so agree to disagree.

332
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:11,603
- You're so touchy, Touchy.

333
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:12,436
- You started it.

334
00:20:12,436 --> 00:20:13,853
- Did not.

335
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:17,382
- I guess we both did, then.

336
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,215
- Yeah, but then there was that time

337
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:20,113
when I didn't do anything, and
then you started everything,

338
00:20:20,113 --> 00:20:21,869
and then you attacked me in
the middle of the restaurant,

339
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:24,123
and then it was all your fault.

340
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:27,749
- Oh obviously it was
all my fault, as usual.

341
00:20:27,749 --> 00:20:28,736
- Well it was that time.

342
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:32,001
- It was, it was
definitely my fault, I'm sorry.

343
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:33,975
- Well I'm sorry, too, for
being the only guy in here

344
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:35,052
who wanted to share
all this food with you.

345
00:20:35,052 --> 00:20:35,885
- Shh!

346
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:37,333
- And now you just don't
wanna take part in it,

347
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,750
well that's fine.

348
00:20:41,443 --> 00:20:44,418
- What are we even arguing about?

349
00:20:44,418 --> 00:20:45,501
- We weren't.

350
00:20:51,894 --> 00:20:53,767
Remember our first kiss?

351
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:56,683
- Mm-hmm, I had pulled
you away from that party

352
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:58,433
to watch the sunrise.

353
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:06,024
- I never saw the sunrise
before that, you know.

354
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:12,737
Let's pretend it's the first time.

355
00:21:12,737 --> 00:21:13,570
- Okay.

356
00:21:17,123 --> 00:21:17,956
- Slower.

357
00:21:49,573 --> 00:21:51,938
- Hey, how much you make last night?

358
00:21:51,938 --> 00:21:52,771
- 500.

359
00:21:52,771 --> 00:21:56,215
- Jesus, why am I still in school?

360
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,689
- Because it's what normal people do?

361
00:21:58,689 --> 00:22:01,526
- If normal is being 100 grand
in debt, then fuck normal.

362
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:04,152
- At least that 100 grand
gets us a piece of paper

363
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:06,985
that says we're good at something.

364
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,774
- You check the mail yet?

365
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:13,246
- No, I'm afraid there might be bills.

366
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:14,400
- If you need me to cover you this month,

367
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,906
you know I can do it.

368
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:20,105
- It's fine, I'm just
waiting for a check to clear.

369
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:29,632
- Hello.

370
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:31,802
- Kurt?

371
00:22:31,802 --> 00:22:32,911
- Hey, Kevin.

372
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:36,006
- How's your day been?

373
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:38,028
- Busy, man, busy.

374
00:22:38,028 --> 00:22:39,591
- Oh, busy's good.

375
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,042
You got time to make another delivery?

376
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:45,242
- Ooh, I don't know; I'm pretty winded.

377
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:47,279
- Awe, I'll
make it worth your time.

378
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,807
I'll pay you 20 over your asking price.

379
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:51,317
- I'm not a whore.

380
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:55,278
- Apparently not a
good business man, either.

381
00:22:55,278 --> 00:22:58,267
- All right, all right,
let's not get personal.

382
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:01,120
- Never; just business.

383
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,757
- Um, how about I head
over in about an hour?

384
00:23:04,757 --> 00:23:07,139
I'm gonna make a sandwich first.

385
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:08,748
- All right,
I'll text you my address.

386
00:23:08,748 --> 00:23:11,042
- Sounds good, I'll see you then.

387
00:23:11,042 --> 00:23:12,393
- Bye, Kurt.

388
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:13,476
- Bye, Kevin.

389
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:19,714
Shit.

390
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,875
- Just take a seat anywhere.

391
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:34,061
Neighbors.

392
00:23:34,061 --> 00:23:34,894
- Nice.

393
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:42,713
I really like your place, it's nice.

394
00:23:42,713 --> 00:23:45,822
- It's okay, my parents pay for it, so.

395
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:47,286
- Must be nice.

396
00:23:47,286 --> 00:23:49,580
- Not really; they've
got my balls on a leash.

397
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:56,243
So you make house calls?

398
00:23:56,243 --> 00:24:00,484
- Yeah, I - sorry - I
know it's not the usual,

399
00:24:00,484 --> 00:24:03,337
but I promised my roommate
I wouldn't be selling drugs

400
00:24:03,337 --> 00:24:06,680
inside the apartment, so here I am.

401
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,797
- You should be careful;

402
00:24:07,797 --> 00:24:11,004
it's only a matter of time
before you get caught or worse.

403
00:24:11,004 --> 00:24:13,171
- Hey, I'm pretty careful.

404
00:24:14,935 --> 00:24:17,435
Oh, um, how much did you want?

405
00:24:18,565 --> 00:24:20,565
- What's your best deal?

406
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:24,239
- I can do an eighth for 50?

407
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:26,171
- Sounds good; same stuff as before?

408
00:24:26,171 --> 00:24:28,464
- Yep, Solar Flare.

409
00:24:28,464 --> 00:24:29,297
- Shweet.

410
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:36,064
For your efforts.

411
00:24:36,064 --> 00:24:39,007
- No, don't worry about it.

412
00:24:39,007 --> 00:24:42,674
- Consider it incentive
for future business.

413
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:44,844
Wanna burn?

414
00:24:55,541 --> 00:24:57,443
- I should go.

415
00:24:57,443 --> 00:24:59,556
- You should stay, just one hit?

416
00:24:59,556 --> 00:25:03,389
- I gotta go, I promised I'd be somewhere.

417
00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:06,526
But I'll take a
rain-check, how about that?

418
00:25:06,526 --> 00:25:08,679
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

419
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:09,512
- All right.

420
00:25:09,512 --> 00:25:12,095
- All right, I'll show you out.

421
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:21,824
So that was fun.

422
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:22,657
- Yeah.

423
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:24,549
- We should hang out again soon.

424
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:25,545
- I don't know, I'm pretty--

425
00:25:25,545 --> 00:25:26,895
- Busy.

426
00:25:26,895 --> 00:25:27,728
- Yeah, and--

427
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:29,811
- You've got a boyfriend.

428
00:25:36,163 --> 00:25:36,996
- Um.

429
00:25:36,996 --> 00:25:39,163
- I'm sorry, that was bad.

430
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:42,379
- Why did you do that?

431
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:45,732
- I don't know, I thought you...

432
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:47,565
- That never happened.

433
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:16,866
Did you cum?

434
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,145
Like a 16 year old.

435
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:25,729
- You're like a 60 year old man.

436
00:26:27,446 --> 00:26:28,863
Wanna keep going?

437
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:31,909
- No.

438
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,213
- You hungry?

439
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:04,635
Let's order some food,
stay in, and watch tv.

440
00:27:04,635 --> 00:27:05,802
- Sounds good.

441
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:13,324
Stop.

442
00:27:13,324 --> 00:27:14,157
- What?

443
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:14,990
- Stop it!

444
00:27:16,196 --> 00:27:17,029
Stop!

445
00:27:18,445 --> 00:27:19,278
Stop!

446
00:27:21,635 --> 00:27:23,424
Stop it, stop.

447
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:24,257
- What?

448
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:47,102
Fuck off, Eddie.

449
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:05,736
- Shit. Just a second.

450
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,007
Just a second!

451
00:28:09,826 --> 00:28:11,159
Hey what the f--

452
00:28:14,135 --> 00:28:16,451
Suddenly need to go, or...?

453
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:17,451
- Guess not.

454
00:28:18,843 --> 00:28:22,261
- Yeah I was just uh... Want some?

455
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:24,110
- Are you sure?

456
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,027
- Yeah, it's just weed.

457
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:36,531
- How are things?

458
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:37,698
- Pretty good.

459
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:40,448
- Is your boyfriend here?

460
00:28:40,448 --> 00:28:43,281
- Not yet; he's on his way though.

461
00:28:44,855 --> 00:28:47,828
- Oh, I did this all
the time freshman year.

462
00:28:47,828 --> 00:28:48,756
It gets you higher.

463
00:28:48,756 --> 00:28:49,589
- Does it?

464
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:50,422
- It does.

465
00:28:52,468 --> 00:28:55,385
- All right, spark up, let's do it.

466
00:29:10,926 --> 00:29:11,759
There you are.

467
00:29:30,323 --> 00:29:31,323
- Hey, guys.

468
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:33,637
Is she okay.

469
00:29:36,297 --> 00:29:37,821
- She's a trooper.

470
00:29:37,821 --> 00:29:38,654
Looking for Kurt?

471
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:41,398
- Yeah, I tried to call him,
but he didn't answer his phone.

472
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,065
- Yeah I haven't seen
him since he got here.

473
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:49,461
- All right.

474
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,953
- Oh man.

475
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,699
Oh shit.

476
00:30:07,699 --> 00:30:08,699
- Who is it?

477
00:30:14,534 --> 00:30:16,201
- Paul, you made it.

478
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:19,295
- Yeah, I tried calling you.

479
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:21,045
- Oh, we were just...

480
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:25,358
Sorry, it was on silent, you know.

481
00:30:26,373 --> 00:30:27,206
- Yeah.

482
00:30:29,098 --> 00:30:31,294
- Um, this is Kevin.

483
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:32,999
- Nice to meet you.

484
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,516
We were just trying some of his new shit.

485
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,609
- Yeah it's nice to meet you, too.

486
00:30:39,474 --> 00:30:41,724
All right, okay, all right.

487
00:30:56,544 --> 00:30:57,600
- Hey.

488
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,433
- Hey.

489
00:30:59,502 --> 00:31:01,305
- How was work?

490
00:31:01,305 --> 00:31:02,638
- Same as usual.

491
00:31:03,524 --> 00:31:04,691
- That's good.

492
00:31:07,236 --> 00:31:10,069
Look, nothing happened back there.

493
00:31:11,025 --> 00:31:12,707
- I believe you.

494
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:13,540
- Do you?

495
00:31:14,465 --> 00:31:16,480
- Why wouldn't I?

496
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,284
- I don't know, Paul,
you seem pretty upset.

497
00:31:20,284 --> 00:31:21,451
- Should I be?

498
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:24,049
- No, nothing happened.

499
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,466
- I can see that.

500
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:37,799
Who is he?

501
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:41,383
- He's just some kid I sell weed to.

502
00:31:41,383 --> 00:31:43,760
- I've seen him before.

503
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,677
- Probably.

504
00:31:47,266 --> 00:31:49,562
- You guys looked like you
were having a lot of fun.

505
00:31:49,562 --> 00:31:51,360
- Yeah he's a fun guy.

506
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,777
Am I not allowed to have fun?

507
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:59,870
- Just be smart, okay?

508
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,326
- Okay.

509
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:02,881
- I trust you, I just
don't trust other people;

510
00:32:02,881 --> 00:32:04,647
I know how they are.

511
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:05,647
- I do, too.

512
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,668
- I just need to hear it,
just tell me it's not gonna

513
00:32:14,668 --> 00:32:16,751
be an issue, I'm sorry, I know
this is like me freaking out,

514
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:17,584
just tell me it's not gonna be an issue,

515
00:32:17,584 --> 00:32:19,286
and I'll believe it.

516
00:32:19,286 --> 00:32:22,453
- It's not going to be an issue, okay?

517
00:32:28,553 --> 00:32:29,386
Okay?

518
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,390
- I'm just tired, all right?

519
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,556
I'm sorry, I'm just really tired.

520
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:34,484
- Come on, do you wanna go home?

521
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:36,363
- No, I don't.

522
00:32:36,363 --> 00:32:39,532
Know what, I just wanna drink.

523
00:32:39,532 --> 00:32:40,365
- You want a drink?

524
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:42,105
- I wanna drink; I want a lot to drink.

525
00:32:42,105 --> 00:32:44,855
- Well there's booze back inside.

526
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:49,131
Come on.

527
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:52,279
Come on, come on, let's go.

528
00:33:22,493 --> 00:33:23,586
- Hey, dude, where you at?

529
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,828
- Are you into me?

530
00:33:25,828 --> 00:33:27,782
- What?!

531
00:33:27,782 --> 00:33:29,729
- Are you into me?

532
00:33:29,729 --> 00:33:31,229
- No, why?

533
00:33:34,294 --> 00:33:37,751
- Then why did you kiss
me the other night?

534
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:40,251
- Because I wanted to?

535
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:45,169
- What does that mean?

536
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:48,086
- I like you, I don't know.

537
00:33:50,753 --> 00:33:53,734
Man, why don't you come back to the party?

538
00:33:53,734 --> 00:33:55,054
- I can't.

539
00:33:55,054 --> 00:33:56,767
- What?

540
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:57,944
- No, I can't.

541
00:33:57,944 --> 00:34:01,460
- You can do whatever you want.

542
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,407
I'll see you soon, then?

543
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:05,157
- Later, not tonight.

544
00:34:06,689 --> 00:34:08,356
- Hey, Kurt?

545
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:10,232
- What?

546
00:34:11,566 --> 00:34:12,899
- Relax.

547
00:34:14,364 --> 00:34:16,114
- Goodbye, Kevin.

548
00:34:27,871 --> 00:34:28,704
Shit.

549
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:33,690
- You gotta bubble up.

550
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,523
- I bubbled!

551
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:40,692
- You can't bubble up on
Bubble Up, how bout that?

552
00:34:40,692 --> 00:34:44,692
- Well how the fuck was
I supposed to know that?

553
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:47,654
- Here we go.

554
00:34:52,748 --> 00:34:54,248
- This game sucks.

555
00:34:58,547 --> 00:35:00,146
I hate it.

556
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:01,646
- Well don't quit.

557
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,835
I thought you said you were
gonna go a day without smoking.

558
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:16,002
- Yeah, well you're pissing
me off, so leave me alone.

559
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,451
- I wanna smoke.

560
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,603
- Seriously?

561
00:35:23,603 --> 00:35:25,436
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

562
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:27,637
- Are you sure?

563
00:35:27,637 --> 00:35:30,304
- Mm-hmm, yeah, dude, I want to.

564
00:35:31,531 --> 00:35:32,364
- Okay.

565
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:33,364
- Thank you.

566
00:35:57,347 --> 00:35:59,097
- What are you doing?

567
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:14,023
Shit, I don't know, I think I'm too high.

568
00:36:15,127 --> 00:36:17,127
- You're never too high.

569
00:36:18,582 --> 00:36:19,415
- Sorry.

570
00:36:23,329 --> 00:36:24,242
- Is it me?

571
00:36:24,242 --> 00:36:28,409
- No, it's not you, I think
I'm just too fucking high.

572
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,827
Look, let's just be chill.

573
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:36,644
- All right.

574
00:36:44,232 --> 00:36:45,315
- Babe. Paul.

575
00:36:46,685 --> 00:36:47,518
- What?

576
00:36:50,194 --> 00:36:54,361
- Can't we just lay down
here and not do anything?

577
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,230
- Yeah, but where's the fun in that?

578
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,897
- I'm being serious.

579
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:04,245
- Okay.

580
00:37:04,245 --> 00:37:08,328
- Look, I'm just, I'm not
in the mood, I'm sorry.

581
00:37:11,451 --> 00:37:12,284
- Okay.

582
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:38,775
I can feel your heartbeat through my back.

583
00:38:10,729 --> 00:38:12,200
- Can I help you? Excuse me?

584
00:38:28,727 --> 00:38:30,869
- With the investigation
of a Boystown murder

585
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:34,628
still underway, authorities
continue to pursue all leads.

586
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:37,569
The entire city's force is on watch

587
00:38:37,569 --> 00:38:39,933
and enforcing strict curfew.

588
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:42,363
They're asking anyone who
sees anything suspicious

589
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:44,438
to report it, and reminding people

590
00:38:44,438 --> 00:38:46,855
not to travel alone at night.

591
00:40:01,387 --> 00:40:04,887
- We're gonna get another noise complaint.

592
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:07,667
What are you doing?

593
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:15,108
- I tried to cook spaghetti,
but I burned the meat.

594
00:40:15,108 --> 00:40:17,691
- It's the thought that counts.

595
00:40:18,571 --> 00:40:19,404
You okay?

596
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:23,034
- No.

597
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:31,548
- What happened.

598
00:40:32,909 --> 00:40:36,002
- Paul wants to go to Paris.

599
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:38,335
But when I think about it...

600
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:42,792
When I think about the future, I see...

601
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:46,907
I don't know what I see.

602
00:40:49,337 --> 00:40:52,981
Last night, I dreamt that
I shot him in the head,

603
00:40:52,981 --> 00:40:56,148
then watched him die right in my arms.

604
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:02,852
When I woke up, I felt
horrible, completely horrible.

605
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:05,455
But I can't remember if it
was because I'd shot him,

606
00:41:05,455 --> 00:41:08,038
or if I really wanted him dead.

607
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:11,393
What does that mean.

608
00:41:13,492 --> 00:41:16,825
- I don't know man, it was just a dream.

609
00:41:25,815 --> 00:41:27,098
- You know I don't want to hurt him, Brad.

610
00:41:27,098 --> 00:41:29,015
I couldn't, I wouldn't.

611
00:41:30,048 --> 00:41:32,215
- I don't think you would.

612
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:35,557
- I'm selfish.

613
00:41:35,557 --> 00:41:36,390
- How?

614
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,170
- It just doesn't make any sense.

615
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,983
He's beautiful, he's kind, he's caring.

616
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:48,476
And I'd throw it all away right now,

617
00:41:48,476 --> 00:41:51,226
and if it was that easy, I would.

618
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:58,109
I just wish I could go back
to the beginning, you know?

619
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:01,609
Back to when things were new and exciting.

620
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:03,711
Back to when I'd get butterflies

621
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:06,933
from a fucking text message, you know?

622
00:42:06,933 --> 00:42:09,433
Just waiting for the response.

623
00:42:13,635 --> 00:42:17,135
Everything about them gives you a hard-on.

624
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:25,019
You always wanna know
exactly what they're doing.

625
00:42:26,313 --> 00:42:28,380
Nothing else matters.

626
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,213
- Yeah.

627
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,391
- It's that spark.

628
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:37,534
It's that spark that fades.

629
00:42:39,065 --> 00:42:42,031
You get to know someone, you
let them under your skin,

630
00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:45,114
and you feel like you're suffocating.

631
00:42:46,091 --> 00:42:47,924
- Listen, Kurt.

632
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:52,170
Are you happy?

633
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:55,780
Does he make you happy?

634
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,206
- What if there's
someone else out there?

635
00:42:57,206 --> 00:43:00,805
Someone who could make me happier?

636
00:43:00,805 --> 00:43:03,975
- There's always someone else.

637
00:43:03,975 --> 00:43:05,967
There's always someone else who's smarter

638
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:09,134
and cuter, funnier, that's life, Kurt.

639
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:15,438
- I don't know if I
could be happy knowing that.

640
00:43:48,864 --> 00:43:51,818
- You got a text when
you were in the bathroom.

641
00:43:51,818 --> 00:43:52,651
- Oh.

642
00:43:54,988 --> 00:43:56,708
- It's from Kevin.

643
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:58,285
- You looked?

644
00:43:58,285 --> 00:44:00,877
- It was right on your screen, Kurt.

645
00:44:00,877 --> 00:44:02,627
- It can wait.

646
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,403
- Seemed pretty urgent.

647
00:44:06,403 --> 00:44:08,826
- It's just weed, babe, it can wait.

648
00:44:08,826 --> 00:44:10,601
- That's not what the
conversation looked like.

649
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:11,634
- What?

650
00:44:11,634 --> 00:44:13,249
- You guys chill a lot?

651
00:44:13,249 --> 00:44:14,713
Plan on chilling some more?

652
00:44:14,713 --> 00:44:16,654
- What are you talking about?

653
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,175
- Don't sit there
and act like I'm an idiot.

654
00:44:18,175 --> 00:44:19,541
- What the hell are you talking about?

655
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:20,393
- Your text, Kurt.

656
00:44:20,393 --> 00:44:22,220
- Oh, so you're going through my texts?

657
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,680
- No, I-- It was open and I saw something

658
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,653
and I think you need to explain.

659
00:44:25,653 --> 00:44:28,061
- There's nothing to explain.

660
00:44:28,996 --> 00:44:30,143
You don't do that; you don't go through

661
00:44:30,143 --> 00:44:32,014
people's shit like that.

662
00:44:32,014 --> 00:44:34,490
He buys weed from me, sometimes
we hang out afterward,

663
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:35,682
it's not a big deal.

664
00:44:35,682 --> 00:44:36,610
- Then why are you getting so upset?

665
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:38,482
- Because you're making me
upset by blowing this up.

666
00:44:38,482 --> 00:44:41,424
- I'm calm, you're freaking out.

667
00:44:41,424 --> 00:44:42,707
- Can't believe you're
doing this right now.

668
00:44:42,707 --> 00:44:44,367
- Me doing this- what is this?

669
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:45,200
- This is bullshit.

670
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,033
- Yeah, I think so, too.

671
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:48,261
- You wanna go through my
texts, go ahead, do it.

672
00:44:48,261 --> 00:44:49,559
Do it, I'll stand right
here and watch you.

673
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:51,211
- I saw enough.

674
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:52,211
- Okay then.

675
00:44:56,214 --> 00:44:57,047
- I just want you to be honest with me.

676
00:44:57,047 --> 00:44:59,587
- Then don't go through
my phone behind my back,

677
00:44:59,587 --> 00:45:02,153
and make me out to be the bad guy.

678
00:45:02,153 --> 00:45:03,806
You know this whole fucking
thing is completely out

679
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:06,556
of context, and you had no right.

680
00:45:15,902 --> 00:45:17,351
- Where are you going?

681
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:18,184
- Home.

682
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:20,415
- Why?

683
00:45:20,415 --> 00:45:21,871
- Because I don't feel like
fighting with you all night.

684
00:45:21,871 --> 00:45:23,131
- We're not fighting, I'm
trying to get you to tell me

685
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:24,203
what the fuck is going on.

686
00:45:24,203 --> 00:45:27,036
- Look, nothing is going on, okay?

687
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:33,478
- So what, you're really just
gonna walk away from this?

688
00:45:33,478 --> 00:45:34,311
Babe, wait!

689
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:35,144
- What?!

690
00:45:53,988 --> 00:45:54,821
- Kurt?

691
00:46:00,514 --> 00:46:01,347
Kurt.

692
00:46:04,802 --> 00:46:07,635
What the hell happened back there?

693
00:46:08,862 --> 00:46:11,195
- I don't know, you tell me.

694
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:19,496
- Just tell me the truth;
you can tell me anything.

695
00:46:22,108 --> 00:46:25,275
- I don't think I can do this anymore.

696
00:46:28,475 --> 00:46:29,808
- Okay, so stop.

697
00:46:32,844 --> 00:46:34,149
- That's not what I mean.

698
00:46:34,149 --> 00:46:35,482
I mean this, us.

699
00:46:40,817 --> 00:46:42,400
- Wait, Kurt, what?

700
00:46:46,699 --> 00:46:49,949
- I mean I don't think this is working.

701
00:46:52,522 --> 00:46:56,189
- Kurt, this is about
a text message, right?

702
00:47:01,014 --> 00:47:03,431
- I think we should break up.

703
00:47:07,043 --> 00:47:07,876
- Why?

704
00:47:09,466 --> 00:47:10,299
I mean, it's a little dramatic.

705
00:47:10,299 --> 00:47:14,299
What, we were fine, we
were arguing, it happens.

706
00:47:15,472 --> 00:47:19,729
Kurt, I'm not connecting
the dots here, what...?

707
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:22,944
- Just, I need to be alone, all right?

708
00:47:22,944 --> 00:47:23,925
- You need space?

709
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:24,758
- Yeah.

710
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:25,591
- Kurt, I can give you space, I can--

711
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:28,008
- No, that's not what I mean.

712
00:47:40,783 --> 00:47:41,616
I'm sorry.

713
00:47:46,518 --> 00:47:48,457
- What did I do?

714
00:47:48,457 --> 00:47:50,540
- You didn't do anything.

715
00:48:01,807 --> 00:48:02,836
- It's that kid.

716
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:03,761
- It's not.

717
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:05,014
- I saw you two,
all right, I'm not stupid.

718
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:05,847
- You're wrong.

719
00:48:05,847 --> 00:48:07,513
- Was he your safety net? Your rebound?

720
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:08,346
- No, hey!

721
00:48:08,346 --> 00:48:11,263
- Fuck you, you're a piece of shit.

722
00:48:18,423 --> 00:48:21,006
- It's not like that, it's not.

723
00:48:22,113 --> 00:48:24,946
It's me, it's us, it's everything.

724
00:48:28,513 --> 00:48:31,508
It just doesn't feel right anymore.

725
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:32,925
It's not perfect.

726
00:48:34,867 --> 00:48:37,236
- You want perfect?

727
00:48:37,236 --> 00:48:39,319
Kurt, I fucking love you.

728
00:48:41,341 --> 00:48:42,924
What more is there?

729
00:48:46,073 --> 00:48:48,490
- I don't know, I don't know.

730
00:48:50,374 --> 00:48:52,541
- Look at me, you love me.

731
00:48:54,623 --> 00:48:55,883
Kurt, look at me.

732
00:48:55,883 --> 00:48:57,362
Look at me, Kurt.

733
00:48:57,362 --> 00:49:01,671
I'm yours, all right, I
don't want anyone else.

734
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:05,694
You mean to tell me I
don't make you happy?

735
00:49:05,694 --> 00:49:07,861
Tell me you don't love me.

736
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,494
- I don't love you.

737
00:49:27,683 --> 00:49:29,516
- I don't believe you.

738
00:49:31,366 --> 00:49:32,366
- I'm sorry.

739
00:49:36,299 --> 00:49:39,216
- Come on, Kurt, this is a mistake.

740
00:49:41,032 --> 00:49:42,199
- Sorry, Paul.

741
00:49:51,092 --> 00:49:51,925
- So, what, that's it?

742
00:49:51,925 --> 00:49:53,592
This is how it ends?

743
00:49:55,302 --> 00:49:56,219
- Guess so.

744
00:50:05,316 --> 00:50:08,066
- This is what'll make you happy?

745
00:50:17,534 --> 00:50:18,367
Okay.

746
00:51:09,205 --> 00:51:10,038
- Fuck!

747
00:53:48,797 --> 00:53:50,669
- What are you doing?

748
00:53:50,669 --> 00:53:51,752
- I gotta go.

749
00:53:53,921 --> 00:53:55,671
- Your breath stinks.

750
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,423
- You're an hour late.

751
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:57,803
Did you realize that you were that late?

752
00:54:59,827 --> 00:55:01,136
- Yeah, I looked at the wrong schedule.

753
00:55:01,136 --> 00:55:03,553
- Oh, that happens sometimes.

754
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:07,471
Uh, Paul?

755
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,683
What is uh...

756
00:55:12,752 --> 00:55:13,585
- What?

757
00:55:40,064 --> 00:55:42,764
- I don't mean to be, um, intrusive or--

758
00:55:42,764 --> 00:55:44,764
- But you can't help it.

759
00:55:46,845 --> 00:55:50,762
- I noticed that your,
um, relationship status,

760
00:55:51,779 --> 00:55:53,862
um, changed this morning.

761
00:55:58,324 --> 00:56:00,230
- Yeah; I didn't realize we were friends.

762
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,897
- Oh, you added me a while back.

763
00:56:06,793 --> 00:56:10,710
So anyway, um, it's my
birthday today, and, um,

764
00:56:11,846 --> 00:56:15,473
I don't know, I'm having a
little get together tonight,

765
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:17,723
and it could be cool stuff.

766
00:56:19,935 --> 00:56:23,268
So, I don't know, if you wanted to come,

767
00:56:24,332 --> 00:56:26,665
you're more than welcome to.

768
00:56:29,295 --> 00:56:32,073
Or whatever, you know. It's whatever.

769
00:56:32,073 --> 00:56:33,367
I don't know, it...

770
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:35,776
If you don't wanna go, it's totally cool.

771
00:56:35,776 --> 00:56:39,443
No sweat off my back
or anything, your back.

772
00:56:43,222 --> 00:56:44,555
Um. It's just...

773
00:56:46,828 --> 00:56:48,357
I don't have that many friends...

774
00:56:48,357 --> 00:56:49,357
- I'll come.

775
00:56:51,811 --> 00:56:53,728
- Oh, okay, well, um...

776
00:56:57,769 --> 00:56:58,602
Cool.

777
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,566
- So how much do you guys want?

778
00:57:12,566 --> 00:57:13,991
- Can I get a half-eighth?

779
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:15,500
- Me, too.

780
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,800
- I don't do half-eighths,
they're annoying.

781
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:21,180
I can do an eighth for $60?

782
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:24,707
You and Little Chickpea
over here can split it.

783
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:26,349
- Sure.

784
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:27,349
- All right.

785
00:57:31,054 --> 00:57:31,887
Thank you.

786
00:57:35,265 --> 00:57:36,775
- Hey, where you going?

787
00:57:36,775 --> 00:57:37,996
- Gotta head back north.

788
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,246
- But what about Excalibur?

789
00:57:41,468 --> 00:57:43,084
- What about Excalibur?

790
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:44,564
- You should hit one.

791
00:57:44,564 --> 00:57:45,564
- Yeah, man.

792
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,864
All right, you ready for this, man?

793
00:57:49,864 --> 00:57:51,054
- Uh, yeah.

794
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:53,045
- Okay, here we go.

795
00:57:53,045 --> 00:57:53,991
- Suck it.

796
00:57:53,991 --> 00:57:55,074
- Go, go, go.

797
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:58,598
- Come on.

798
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,311
- All right, clear it.

799
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:18,793
- You guys are assholes.

800
00:58:20,754 --> 00:58:23,261
- Paul, do you have any Queens?

801
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:24,875
- Go ballistic.

802
00:58:24,875 --> 00:58:26,792
- Ballistic I shall go.

803
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:30,956
It's to you.

804
00:58:30,956 --> 00:58:31,873
- Oh, um...

805
00:58:33,496 --> 00:58:35,596
Hey, Eddie, do you have any

806
00:58:37,262 --> 00:58:38,786
- Weak, dude. Weak.

807
00:58:38,786 --> 00:58:40,296
- I know, I thought it
was gonna be a bigger one.

808
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:41,883
- It wasn't.

809
00:58:41,883 --> 00:58:42,716
- Hey, Eddie, do you have any

810
00:58:44,382 --> 00:58:45,215
That one was kinda silent.

811
00:58:45,215 --> 00:58:47,206
- Redeeming quality.

812
00:58:47,206 --> 00:58:48,805
- It's better to let it
out and bear the shame,

813
00:58:48,805 --> 00:58:50,752
than it is to hold it
in and bear the pain.

814
00:58:50,752 --> 00:58:51,585
- Yeah, said it again.

815
00:58:51,585 --> 00:58:53,309
- Ben Franklin said that.

816
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:54,284
- Might've been Gandhi.

817
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:56,069
- Eddie, you remember that time

818
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:58,902
that fat hooker tried to rape you?

819
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:02,774
You were telling us that
story the other day.

820
00:59:02,774 --> 00:59:04,693
- No, she did, no, Crystal.

821
00:59:04,693 --> 00:59:06,129
- Crystal was her name!

822
00:59:06,129 --> 00:59:08,800
- She pushed you up against
that car and just like,

823
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:11,310
tried to you know, into ya.

824
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:12,369
- Tried to stick you in her.

825
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:14,279
- Yeah up in it.

826
00:59:14,279 --> 00:59:17,808
Hey, Eddie, where'd you
get that alligator head?

827
00:59:17,808 --> 00:59:20,058
- I dunno, Louisiana maybe?

828
00:59:21,669 --> 00:59:24,310
- You don't know where
you got an alligator head?

829
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,287
- That must've been a seven footer.

830
00:59:26,287 --> 00:59:27,828
- I don't know.

831
00:59:27,828 --> 00:59:31,995
- Adolescent; killed it at
its adolescent age, monster.

832
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,343
- Do you have any sevens?

833
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:42,891
- Ay-yo, now we're talking,
check this out, right?

834
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:43,994
Yes, yes, yes.

835
00:59:43,994 --> 00:59:46,173
Do it, do it, toot the horn.

836
00:59:47,073 --> 00:59:49,891
All aboard drunk train, here we go.

837
00:59:49,891 --> 00:59:52,228
Put it, all right, dude,
who're you trying to impress?

838
00:59:52,228 --> 00:59:53,650
Bunch of dudes here, so.

839
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:55,499
Good?

840
00:59:57,017 --> 00:59:57,850
- Yes!

841
00:59:58,683 --> 00:59:59,560
- Thanks, Justin, you drank

842
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,781
half my fucking birthday present.

843
01:00:02,781 --> 01:00:05,858
- Bro, relax, I drank like a third of it.

844
01:00:05,858 --> 01:00:07,525
You got plenty more.

845
01:00:10,313 --> 01:00:13,248
- This one time, I shit
my pants at a restaurant.

846
01:00:20,736 --> 01:00:23,682
- I'm sorry about my friends.

847
01:00:23,682 --> 01:00:24,515
- No, why?

848
01:00:25,685 --> 01:00:27,197
- They're assholes.

849
01:00:27,197 --> 01:00:29,621
- I think they're nice.

850
01:00:29,621 --> 01:00:30,454
- You like them?

851
01:00:30,454 --> 01:00:32,207
- Yeah, they're fun.

852
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:34,540
- Yeah, they're pretty cool.

853
01:00:40,537 --> 01:00:41,370
- Happy birthday.

854
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:42,203
- Oh, yeah.

855
01:00:42,203 --> 01:00:43,036
- Right.

856
01:00:43,036 --> 01:00:43,869
- Cheers.

857
01:00:43,869 --> 01:00:45,202
- Cheers.

858
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:57,459
- If you were gay, I mean, if I were gay,

859
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,797
do you ever look at me?

860
01:01:04,395 --> 01:01:05,228
Sexually?

861
01:01:06,676 --> 01:01:07,509
Ever?

862
01:01:10,942 --> 01:01:11,775
- Eddie, I think we should--

863
01:01:11,775 --> 01:01:15,147
- Oh, right, right, just, it's
stupid, yeah, we don't have

864
01:01:15,147 --> 01:01:16,730
to talk about that.

865
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,713
Cuz I wouldn't mind.

866
01:01:21,713 --> 01:01:25,213
I mean, I'm not gay or anything, I just...

867
01:01:27,242 --> 01:01:31,409
Just open to new stuff, and
trying new things, I don't know.

868
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,676
- Eddie, I think we should--

869
01:01:37,676 --> 01:01:39,676
- You guys were perfect.

870
01:01:40,872 --> 01:01:43,789
I mean, that's what it looked like.

871
01:01:44,689 --> 01:01:48,356
You guys had the best
pictures and statuses.

872
01:01:53,997 --> 01:01:56,989
I was always jealous of that.

873
01:01:56,989 --> 01:01:57,906
Of you two.

874
01:01:59,154 --> 01:01:59,987
With him.

875
01:02:05,368 --> 01:02:06,329
- Eddie...

876
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:10,671
- You don't have to say
anything, if you don't want to.

877
01:02:10,671 --> 01:02:14,588
I mean, sometimes words
ruin the best emotions.

878
01:02:17,843 --> 01:02:22,475
- Eddie, I think we should
go back to the party.

879
01:02:22,475 --> 01:02:23,726
- Yeah?

880
01:02:23,726 --> 01:02:24,559
- Yeah.

881
01:02:26,123 --> 01:02:27,297
- Okay.

882
01:02:27,297 --> 01:02:28,130
- All right.

883
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:29,213
- Yeah, okay.

884
01:04:52,965 --> 01:04:55,014
- Hello?

885
01:04:55,014 --> 01:04:57,597
- Look, it's me, don't hang up.

886
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,025
- What do you want, Kurt?

887
01:05:01,025 --> 01:05:04,025
- Listen, I just, I just got mugged.

888
01:05:06,598 --> 01:05:08,431
- Are you okay?

889
01:05:09,503 --> 01:05:12,086
- I'm just, I'm a little dazed.

890
01:05:13,146 --> 01:05:14,479
Just some blood.

891
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,111
I'm okay though.

892
01:05:20,294 --> 01:05:24,461
Look, my phone got stolen,
my money, my train pass.

893
01:05:27,503 --> 01:05:29,265
I woulda called Brad, but I didn't,

894
01:05:29,265 --> 01:05:30,614
I don't even know his fucking number,

895
01:05:30,614 --> 01:05:33,114
I don't even know your number.

896
01:05:34,785 --> 01:05:37,035
Your place was the closest,

897
01:05:37,918 --> 01:05:41,335
I didn't know what else to do, I'm sorry.

898
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:01,334
You know I really
appreciate you doing this.

899
01:06:01,334 --> 01:06:05,198
- I'm not gonna leave you in
the street like this alone.

900
01:06:05,198 --> 01:06:07,424
Even if you do deserve it.

901
01:06:07,424 --> 01:06:10,413
You know you're lucky; it
could've been a serial killer.

902
01:06:10,413 --> 01:06:13,246
- Wish it was, now I'm just broke.

903
01:06:15,074 --> 01:06:16,839
- Okay, you should probably
get stitches, honestly.

904
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:18,089
- I'll be fine.

905
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:23,621
- Well, I'd hate to say I told you so.

906
01:06:23,621 --> 01:06:24,454
- Got it.

907
01:06:34,218 --> 01:06:36,500
- Well, okay, look, I've gotta go to bed,

908
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,794
I've gotta work in the morning, so...

909
01:06:39,794 --> 01:06:41,410
I mean, you can stay over if you want.

910
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:43,419
- Is that okay?

911
01:06:43,419 --> 01:06:45,586
- Gonna have to be, right?

912
01:06:47,395 --> 01:06:48,895
- Thanks, anyways.

913
01:06:59,902 --> 01:07:01,485
- You can use this.

914
01:07:15,059 --> 01:07:18,476
Also, I'm pretty sure this is yours, too.

915
01:07:39,253 --> 01:07:40,170
Good night.

916
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,457
- I'm fine.

917
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:46,146
- You know, it's a good
thing Paul texted me,

918
01:08:46,146 --> 01:08:48,032
I thought you were fucking dead.

919
01:08:48,032 --> 01:08:50,572
- Well I appreciate the
concern, but I'm fine,

920
01:08:50,572 --> 01:08:52,261
I just lost my fucking
phone, and my money--

921
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:56,082
- Yeah, well, I mean are you
and Paul working it out or?

922
01:08:56,082 --> 01:08:56,915
- Brad.

923
01:08:56,915 --> 01:08:58,276
- What?

924
01:08:58,276 --> 01:08:59,109
Okay.

925
01:09:01,547 --> 01:09:04,989
You can talk to me if you want, you know.

926
01:09:04,989 --> 01:09:07,072
- I said I'm fine.

927
01:09:33,079 --> 01:09:33,912
Okay.

928
01:09:43,365 --> 01:09:44,499
- This is Chip.

929
01:09:44,499 --> 01:09:45,332
- Hey.

930
01:09:45,332 --> 01:09:46,165
- How's it going?

931
01:09:46,165 --> 01:09:46,998
- Jerry.

932
01:09:46,998 --> 01:09:48,000
- Kurt.

933
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,657
- Christine.

934
01:09:49,657 --> 01:09:50,490
- Nice to meet you.

935
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:51,323
- Santos.

936
01:09:51,323 --> 01:09:52,213
- Kurt.

937
01:09:52,213 --> 01:09:53,984
- And Peter.

938
01:09:53,984 --> 01:09:55,626
- Nice to meet you.

939
01:09:55,626 --> 01:09:58,532
- This guy has the best weed.

940
01:09:58,532 --> 01:10:00,041
- Can I get you a beer, man?

941
01:10:00,041 --> 01:10:02,208
- Yeah, sure, let's do it.

942
01:10:44,356 --> 01:10:46,606
Oh yeah, I'm getting there.

943
01:11:05,339 --> 01:11:06,172
All right.

944
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:14,520
Oh my God.

945
01:11:32,544 --> 01:11:34,256
- Your boyfriend.

946
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:36,256
- He's not my boyfriend.

947
01:11:39,135 --> 01:11:40,096
I should say hi.

948
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:40,929
- Why?

949
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:43,845
- I'm gonna go say hi.

950
01:11:53,305 --> 01:11:54,138
Hey.

951
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:56,530
- Hey, Kurt.

952
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:59,159
- What are you doing here?

953
01:11:59,159 --> 01:12:00,755
- Not allowed to be at the same party?

954
01:12:00,755 --> 01:12:02,338
- Yeah, no, I mean.

955
01:12:05,037 --> 01:12:07,787
Thank you so much for last night.

956
01:12:09,204 --> 01:12:10,037
Thank you.

957
01:12:11,099 --> 01:12:14,220
- You're welcome; just
happy you're all right.

958
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:16,970
- Oh, no, no, dude, I got mugged.

959
01:12:20,866 --> 01:12:23,162
- You here long?

960
01:12:23,162 --> 01:12:25,162
- No, no, yeah, no, I'm.

961
01:12:33,553 --> 01:12:36,053
Well, I just wanted to say hi.

962
01:12:38,232 --> 01:12:39,065
- Hi.

963
01:12:43,619 --> 01:12:44,452
- Okay.

964
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:29,640
- Doing all right?

965
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:34,069
Doesn't look like it.

966
01:13:36,499 --> 01:13:38,040
Can I sit down?

967
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:38,873
Yeah?

968
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:40,040
- Yeah.

969
01:13:46,704 --> 01:13:49,287
- I was looking for you inside.

970
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:53,816
- Just came out here
to get some fresh air.

971
01:13:55,257 --> 01:13:58,537
Who are those people you were with?

972
01:13:58,537 --> 01:13:59,704
- Just people.

973
01:14:00,746 --> 01:14:01,579
- Friends?

974
01:14:03,112 --> 01:14:03,945
- Yeah.

975
01:14:05,582 --> 01:14:07,749
- I want us to be friends.

976
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:11,440
- Friends like you're friends with Kevin?

977
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,841
That kind of friends?

978
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:15,424
- That's different.

979
01:14:17,225 --> 01:14:18,392
- No it's not.

980
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,094
Do you like him?

981
01:14:28,134 --> 01:14:28,967
- What?

982
01:14:31,365 --> 01:14:34,198
- Seemed like you were having fun.

983
01:14:36,134 --> 01:14:38,051
- It's nothing serious.

984
01:14:39,888 --> 01:14:43,388
- Just someone to fool around with, right?

985
01:14:44,932 --> 01:14:48,515
- You think you know
me so well, don't you?

986
01:14:51,127 --> 01:14:51,960
- I don't.

987
01:15:06,445 --> 01:15:07,778
It looks better.

988
01:15:09,663 --> 01:15:11,847
- Yeah it doesn't hurt anymore.

989
01:15:11,847 --> 01:15:14,680
- That's good, that's really good.

990
01:15:18,822 --> 01:15:20,405
What are you doing?

991
01:15:23,778 --> 01:15:26,056
You can't do that.

992
01:15:26,056 --> 01:15:27,384
- Why not?

993
01:15:27,384 --> 01:15:29,717
- Because you don't mean it.

994
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:44,777
Tell me you love me.

995
01:15:50,038 --> 01:15:50,871
Tell me.

996
01:16:00,196 --> 01:16:02,029
That's what I thought.

997
01:16:03,133 --> 01:16:03,966
- Wait!

998
01:16:03,966 --> 01:16:07,049
- This whole thing's just gonna sink.

999
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:10,790
I don't wanna see you anymore.

1000
01:17:46,848 --> 01:17:48,098
- Hey, it's me.

1001
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:56,092
I don't know why I'm calling.

1002
01:17:56,092 --> 01:17:58,345
I feel like I just need to clear the air,

1003
01:17:58,345 --> 01:17:59,928
and we should talk.

1004
01:18:02,449 --> 01:18:04,914
You're probably at work.

1005
01:18:04,914 --> 01:18:09,146
Try to give me a call
when you get out, okay?

1006
01:18:09,146 --> 01:18:10,146
Thanks, bye.

1007
01:18:47,229 --> 01:18:48,289
Did you get my voice mail?

1008
01:18:48,289 --> 01:18:49,916
- No.

1009
01:18:49,916 --> 01:18:52,204
- Look, I know you probably
don't wanna do this right now,

1010
01:18:52,204 --> 01:18:53,037
- You're right.

1011
01:18:53,037 --> 01:18:54,447
- But I think we should
talk while we're both sober.

1012
01:18:54,447 --> 01:18:56,530
- I was sober last night.

1013
01:18:58,641 --> 01:19:00,058
- I just need you to hear me out.

1014
01:19:00,058 --> 01:19:01,456
- Look, I've heard enough, all right?

1015
01:19:01,456 --> 01:19:03,639
You can't just show up here
and corner me like this;

1016
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:05,432
it's not fair.

1017
01:19:05,432 --> 01:19:07,463
I didn't call you back for a reason.

1018
01:19:07,463 --> 01:19:08,957
- I just need to explain myself.

1019
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:10,290
- No, you don't.

1020
01:19:11,325 --> 01:19:14,101
- Look, I don't want it to end like this.

1021
01:19:14,101 --> 01:19:15,851
- Kurt, you did this.

1022
01:19:16,783 --> 01:19:19,062
All right, this is you.

1023
01:19:19,062 --> 01:19:19,979
We're done.

1024
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:30,513
- I know I fucked you over, but
I don't want you to hate me.

1025
01:19:32,387 --> 01:19:34,129
- You looked me in the eyes,

1026
01:19:34,129 --> 01:19:37,595
and you told me you didn't love me.

1027
01:19:37,595 --> 01:19:39,345
Do you remember that?

1028
01:19:42,943 --> 01:19:47,110
- I'm just trying to make things
easier, I just wanna talk.

1029
01:19:49,846 --> 01:19:50,679
- Why do you do this?

1030
01:19:50,679 --> 01:19:52,609
Why do you, can't you just leave me alone?

1031
01:19:52,609 --> 01:19:53,444
- I don't know, is that what you want?

1032
01:19:53,444 --> 01:19:54,849
- Yes, that's exactly what I want.

1033
01:19:54,849 --> 01:19:56,846
I want you just to stop, all right?

1034
01:19:56,846 --> 01:19:58,090
I wanna move on.

1035
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:59,750
Fuck, you moved on.

1036
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:02,258
I wanna do that, I wanna move on.

1037
01:20:02,258 --> 01:20:03,957
- It's just, you kept
going through my head,

1038
01:20:03,957 --> 01:20:05,341
and I wanna talk and you're ignoring me--

1039
01:20:05,341 --> 01:20:07,341
- Shut up, just shut up!

1040
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:11,816
You just talk and you talk, and you just,

1041
01:20:11,816 --> 01:20:13,068
you have no idea what you're saying;

1042
01:20:13,068 --> 01:20:15,235
you sound like an asshole.

1043
01:20:16,381 --> 01:20:19,356
Now listen though, I'm not
your boyfriend anymore.

1044
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:22,759
All right, I'm not your fucktoy.

1045
01:20:22,759 --> 01:20:24,842
I'm not even your friend.

1046
01:20:25,829 --> 01:20:26,662
- Why not?

1047
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:34,140
- They say what doesn't
kill us makes us stronger.

1048
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:38,223
Well I'm pretty sure some
things just cripple us.

1049
01:20:39,693 --> 01:20:43,360
- Look, I just can't
cut you out of my life.

1050
01:20:44,405 --> 01:20:45,238
Okay?

1051
01:20:46,403 --> 01:20:47,903
- You already did.

1052
01:20:56,114 --> 01:20:59,364
I could've been with you forever, Kurt.

1053
01:21:51,019 --> 01:21:52,269
- Jesus Christ.

1054
01:21:53,387 --> 01:21:55,052
- You can't help, it's over.

1055
01:21:55,052 --> 01:21:58,347
- Look, everything's gonna be okay, okay?

1056
01:21:58,347 --> 01:22:01,157
Just, you're gonna be fine.

1057
01:22:05,831 --> 01:22:09,011
- Yeah, hello, this is an emergency.

1058
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:12,266
Yeah, yeah, someone's been stabbed.

1059
01:22:12,266 --> 01:22:14,091
Yeah, he's awake.

1060
01:22:14,091 --> 01:22:16,174
Yeah, yeah, he's talking.

1061
01:22:18,012 --> 01:22:20,993
I'm at the corner of
Wellington and Sacramento,

1062
01:22:20,993 --> 01:22:23,160
Wellington and Sacramento.

1063
01:22:24,382 --> 01:22:27,132
Yeah, please hurry, please hurry.

1064
01:22:28,163 --> 01:22:32,330
Shit, all right, they're on
their way, just hang on, okay?

1065
01:22:35,404 --> 01:22:36,487
- I know you.

1066
01:22:37,396 --> 01:22:39,252
- I don't think so, buddy.

1067
01:22:39,252 --> 01:22:40,085
- Did you--

1068
01:22:40,085 --> 01:22:42,512
- Don't talk, okay, they're coming.

1069
01:22:42,512 --> 01:22:44,241
- I'm gonna be famous.

1070
01:22:44,241 --> 01:22:46,158
- You're gonna be fine.

1071
01:22:48,941 --> 01:22:50,696
- I'm gonna be on tv.

1072
01:22:50,696 --> 01:22:51,914
- I can hear them, man, you hear that?

1073
01:22:51,914 --> 01:22:52,747
You hear that?

1074
01:22:52,747 --> 01:22:56,356
They're coming, all right, they're coming.

1075
01:22:56,356 --> 01:23:00,716
No no no no, don't go to
sleep, don't go to sleep!

1076
01:23:00,716 --> 01:23:03,299
No, come on, man, stay with me.

1077
01:23:04,394 --> 01:23:05,477
- I know you.

1078
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:13,004
He loves you.

1079
01:23:13,995 --> 01:23:14,828
- The fuck?

1080
01:24:57,390 --> 01:24:59,293
- Remember our first kiss?

1081
01:24:59,293 --> 01:25:02,317
- Mm-hmm. I had pulled
you away from that party

1082
01:25:02,317 --> 01:25:04,067
to watch the sunrise.

1083
01:25:07,514 --> 01:25:11,264
- I never saw
the sunrise before that.
