1
00:00:00,377 --> 00:00:02,945
When you're really into someone

2
00:00:02,946 --> 00:00:07,623
one kiss is too much
and 20.000 are not enough...

3
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:57,346
Meet me at the office.
The boss.

4
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:02,019
Do you know who's that?
Cachito Vigil.

5
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:05,279
Coach of our Olympic champion
women's hockey team.

6
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,216
A motivator, a pep talker.

7
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:09,992
I never believed much in pep talks,
I always thought...

8
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:13,827
the "all together for a common cause"
was kind of a dated slogan...

9
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,967
Until yesterday I kept believing
it was everyman for himself.

10
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:22,072
But, then a motherfucker
like this one comes

11
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,179
and tells you about the piano.

12
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:28,007
There're those who play the piano,
those who move the piano...

13
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,876
Did you know, Juan,
that life is like a choir

14
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:34,858
and everyone is an important piece?

15
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,989
This guy motivated me,
took me to the next level.

16
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:43,531
To put it in three words,
I saw the light.

17
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:51,404
Suddenly, he makes two drawings.
Don't look.

18
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,845
So then...
You can look now.

19
00:01:56,234 --> 00:01:59,581
He shows them to us and says:
"What's the difference?"

20
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:03,345
He asks!
"What's the difference?"

21
00:02:05,112 --> 00:02:07,456
- The smile!
- Or his sadness. Right?

22
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:10,962
Have you seen your coworkers?
Have you seen them, Juan?

23
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:16,593
- All sad, Juan. You too.
- Well yes, I'm getting a divorce.

24
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:21,106
That'd also explain your sloppy look
and lack of punctuality.

25
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:23,442
Don't let yourself go, Juan. Please.

26
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:25,699
- How long have you worked here?
- Three years.

27
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,680
I've been here 24 years, Juan.

28
00:02:29,737 --> 00:02:31,717
Come in! Come in!

29
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:36,922
- Who left these on my desk?
- Guess who!

30
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,460
I did! Come here.

31
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:42,426
- What's the difference?
- One is...

32
00:02:42,686 --> 00:02:45,257
Don't rush it. Take your time.

33
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:47,431
Don't say a word, Juan.
Let's see.

34
00:02:47,923 --> 00:02:51,303
- His sadness!
- Ex-cel-lent!

35
00:02:52,562 --> 00:02:55,772
Everyone's sad around here all the time!

36
00:02:55,866 --> 00:02:58,107
- It's a downer!
- Totally!

37
00:02:58,336 --> 00:03:00,816
In his case, he's getting a divorce.
but it's true for the rest!

38
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,555
This guy Cachito is a motherfucker!
He told us about relaxing workplaces.

39
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,455
Like Google, where they have
table tennis and playstations.

40
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:13,458
Luciana, Juan,
I want you two working together.

41
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,126
I want ideas to make this office
a better place.

42
00:03:17,924 --> 00:03:21,700
- So Juan? It's on?
- Yeah. Sure.

43
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:25,839
- It's on, Juan, or not?
- Yes. it's on.

44
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:28,073
- I'm on your side.
- And I'm on yours!

45
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:42,987
<i>"This time around
You're going to lose it all."</i>

46
00:05:43,813 --> 00:05:50,595
<i>"I'll try to convince you
there's nothing else to wait for."</i>

47
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:59,471
<i>"This time around
I'd rather do it simpler."</i>

48
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:06,475
<i>"May the stars stop
sending signals of love."</i>

49
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:17,290
<i>"Pm going to choose just one
And this is my way of tailing you."</i>

50
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:25,532
<i>"Or would you rather I slowly
gave you these 20,000 kisses."</i>

51
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:51,425
<i>'This time around...
You thought about finding a husband."</i>

52
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:58,433
<i>"The updated version of a good scholar
is no good any more."</i>

53
00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:07,714
<i>"And I this time
thinking about taking you far away."</i>

54
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:15,754
<i>"Up to the mountain
where even time can't find us."</i>

55
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:25,061
<i>"Pm going to choose just one
And this is my way of tailing you."</i>

56
00:07:26,123 --> 00:07:33,099
<i>"Or would you rather I slowly
gave you these 20,000 kisses."</i>

57
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,631
Here is some stuff I found...

58
00:08:00,494 --> 00:08:02,974
Anything else you need, just...

59
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:04,999
Just...

60
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:09,144
- Just ring and I'll get it.
- Cool.

61
00:08:11,472 --> 00:08:15,750
I still don't get how...
you're not devastated.

62
00:08:16,512 --> 00:08:17,819
I don't know...

63
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:22,828
- How're you doing?
- I'm about to score with a chick.

64
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:23,896
But...

65
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,569
There's an issue...

66
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:33,104
She saw my posh side...
Shaved and wearing a suit.

67
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:36,799
- Tell me.
- I'd shave to testify...

68
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,304
...at the police station in a murder case.

69
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,441
- A murder case?
- The quick-mart around the corner.

70
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,385
There was a gunfight.
The cashier shot someone.

71
00:08:46,644 --> 00:08:50,387
But this chick
is in another league, Juan.

72
00:08:50,816 --> 00:08:53,450
- Dinner dates?
- Three.

73
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,620
- Laughs?
- Many.

74
00:08:55,621 --> 00:08:57,156
- How many "I'm kidding"?
- None.

75
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:01,737
- Kisses?
- We start each day with a cheeky...

76
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:04,706
We end each date with
passionate kissing at her doorstep.

77
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,540
- Intercourse?
- Probably tomorrow.

78
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:12,016
It's weird anyway...

79
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:16,087
Every time we went out
I picked the place...

80
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:21,546
I had to educate myself.
I got recommendations, "Pierino",

81
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:23,528
"Setebaco", "Bodega 52"...

82
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:28,028
All very... classy places.

83
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:31,103
All 5 stars stuff...
I'm out of my element here. Still...

84
00:09:32,092 --> 00:09:35,040
<i>- it's weird...
- I'll be weird when it gets weird.</i>

85
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,978
- How do you know you'll score tomorrow?
- Because she's coming to dine here.

86
00:09:40,436 --> 00:09:43,245
What 5 stars delivery
do you have available?

87
00:09:43,405 --> 00:09:46,478
No delivery.
I'm cooking.

88
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:49,010
Breaded meat and mashed potatoes.
Her favorite.

89
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:52,614
- You're cooking?
- Figueroa brings out the chef in me.

90
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:54,595
It's an easy dish.

91
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:01,599
- Turn the lights off.
- Sure.

92
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,789
<i>"Happy birthday Claudita...
Happy birthday to you-"</i>

93
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,696
C'mon on, turn it off...
Enough!

94
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:33,367
I divorced today...

95
00:11:42,734 --> 00:11:43,906
Morning...

96
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:08,195
<i>"They say inside of you
There are hurricanes without sea."</i>

97
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:15,372
<i>"Which is so deep
That is has no end."</i>

98
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:22,751
<i>"That there's a big ship
And that I'm inside."</i>

99
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:29,656
<i>"Fighting the tides
Singing this song..."</i>

100
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:32,091
- How long was it?
- Three years with her.

101
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:34,266
I've been waiting for this moment
for two and a half.

102
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:36,924
- Cheers!
- Let's make a toast!

103
00:12:36,925 --> 00:12:38,905
Look me at the eyes!

104
00:12:39,695 --> 00:12:41,641
- He's separated.
- He's separated.

105
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:44,607
- He's separated.
- He's separated.

106
00:12:48,938 --> 00:12:53,478
My humble homage to an artist
who left a lifelong mark on me...

107
00:12:54,811 --> 00:13:00,125
With ideals, with strength,
with courage, with braveness...

108
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:05,263
A guy who fell and stood up,
fell and stood up...

109
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:08,235
fell... and you stood up.

110
00:13:11,228 --> 00:13:15,566
The past returning, the future
putting the present at risk...

111
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:20,243
Pure and sincere love.
To overcome our own limitations.

112
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:27,251
Think about it, Juan.
Your fears during those three movies.

113
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:32,124
Once you told me:
"Answers are everywhere".

114
00:13:33,386 --> 00:13:37,199
That's why, on each of these walls,

115
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,634
I pay homage to the films
that marked my life.

116
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:44,069
Hey, this is really nice.

117
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:47,141
Are we going out to get pussy
or stay here all night?

118
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,312
- Are you busy?
- Yes.

119
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:55,308
Okay, let me read you some of the ideas
I came up with.

120
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:59,417
Juan...
It's so cool that you're a skater!

121
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:02,018
- Do you ride?
- Yes.

122
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,730
I'm Regular.

123
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:08,200
- I'm a goofy, very nice to meet you.
- I'm Regular.

124
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:13,365
Let's ride together one of these days...

125
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:16,572
Cut the bullshit and do some work.

126
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:21,712
"Invisible friend", "The crossing light",
"The love trampoline",

127
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:24,976
"The invisible window," "Where's the
mattress", "Rings, necklaces and pearls",

128
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:29,054
"3 papers-2 pencils and an rubber",
"Tag", it could be silent or musical tag,

129
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,252
or the inverted tag, "Hop on",
"The potato"...

130
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:36,252
Well! So many ideas...

131
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:38,529
- Let me make a note here...
- Please do, Juan.

132
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:42,761
I want to set the record straight...
I don't want to award myself any merit.

133
00:14:43,028 --> 00:14:45,907
This is all Luciana.
All of them are your ideas.

134
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:47,443
Okay...

135
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:50,775
He's stuck at the idea of the divorce
and feels he hasn't contributed...

136
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:54,542
I see your point, Juan. Back at '89,
when I got my first divorce...

137
00:14:56,342 --> 00:15:02,418
So, let's do something...
Pick three ideas and work on them.

138
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:07,127
Please.
I need one idea. One more.

139
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,792
One idea.
It's really important for me.

140
00:15:10,024 --> 00:15:12,004
For everyone.

141
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:18,040
Last night I cried
while watching "Big Fish".

142
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:20,703
- Have you seen it?
- Yes.

143
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,486
Then that's all I have to say.

144
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:42,102
- Move your leg!
- Give me water.

145
00:15:46,063 --> 00:15:48,043
In a second.

146
00:15:57,808 --> 00:15:59,789
Here.

147
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:06,524
Who were you dating?
What was this guy's name?

148
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:09,933
Tomás, the musician.

149
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:14,993
- Was he a hit?
- You wouldn't have asked if he did.

150
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:27,535
- You were the one who liked this show... Curb?
- Yeah, I'm watching several.

151
00:16:28,007 --> 00:16:31,421
- Tell me a bit more.
- About what?

152
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:34,251
About what you've been doing...
What have you been reading...

153
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:36,815
Whatever...
What shows you're watching...

154
00:16:36,816 --> 00:16:39,262
I don't know, boss.

155
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:43,892
I never finished liberal arts...
I work sometimes...

156
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:47,272
I'm thankful for my folks being loaded,

157
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:49,866
although the price to pay
is my mom's constant nagging.

158
00:16:50,131 --> 00:16:54,843
"When will I see a grandson?"
The boyfriend, the dog, the house...

159
00:16:55,204 --> 00:16:57,184
So I picture my whole life as a comedy.

160
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,483
Ultra nagging parents,
an ex-boyfriend who ruined my life...

161
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,060
Some friends, cool people...

162
00:17:07,216 --> 00:17:10,018
Like I meet you
waiting for the elevator,

163
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:14,764
Scene cut, and here we are...
Talking...

164
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:25,535
What's wrong with you?

165
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:29,075
Nothing, boss.
Just a pause for the laugh track.

166
00:17:33,544 --> 00:17:35,958
So what's the benefit
of coming up with all that?

167
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:38,028
Your problem is you over-think it.

168
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:43,693
It's called "The Andrea Portela Show".
You're either into it or you're not.

169
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:45,769
Laughs!

170
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,333
In one episode, I arrive,
by mistake, at an event.

171
00:17:50,596 --> 00:17:53,703
It's the annual gala of People's
magazine's 50 most famous.

172
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:56,708
I'm an outsider,
but I start staring at them all,

173
00:17:56,936 --> 00:17:59,076
I start blurting my thoughts out
without filter.

174
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:03,747
That one is a homo, she is a dyke...
That one has no talent.

175
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,716
She's got implants and they don't
look good. I play the rebel...

176
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:08,723
The cool cat.
Do you know how it ends?

177
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,794
Everyone posing.
Me seated next to a nobody...

178
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:15,300
Clapping, but with a smile.

179
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:19,405
You're mental, Portela.

180
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:29,303
Immunity was over.

181
00:18:29,304 --> 00:18:33,617
- Yes, yes.
- And the music is back.

182
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:35,755
It's a girl's game anyway...

183
00:18:36,044 --> 00:18:38,924
"Wonder boy" and "Pac-land
are girl's games.

184
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:40,855
- "Boobble, Boobble."
- Yes.

185
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:42,996
- "Boobble, Boobble" is girl-boy.
- It's not!

186
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:44,995
- It's a gill's game.
- It's a girl-girl.

187
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:49,833
Those are all girly. "World Cup",
"Punch Out", those are manly.

188
00:18:51,161 --> 00:18:53,504
Punch Out and it's joysticks...

189
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,772
I liked the black guy on stage 2
who had a resemblance to Apollo Creed.

190
00:18:59,036 --> 00:19:01,608
- "Piston Hurricane"!
- That was his name?

191
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,516
Glass Joe, Piston Hurricane, Bad Bull.

192
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:07,020
- Very good!
- Bad Bull...

193
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,660
So you and Portela...

194
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,897
Fragala, right?

195
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:19,793
Portela!
I can't remember which one she was.

196
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,535
Power rack who thought
she was funny. Right?

197
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:25,141
The one who "some" thought
she was funny.

198
00:19:25,232 --> 00:19:27,211
But she was not funny at all, man!

199
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:32,350
She had something...
What about you, guys?

200
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:36,119
I was doing really good
with this chick...

201
00:19:36,444 --> 00:19:42,190
No sex yet... But well headed...
I was working my way past second base.

202
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:45,891
About three days ago,
we went to the movies,

203
00:19:46,121 --> 00:19:49,967
on the way back we bumped
into a nerdy guy who works with her.

204
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:53,773
She introduced me as... "A friend".

205
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:59,246
Take a step back!

206
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:01,641
Friend zoned!
That's the end of it, boss.

207
00:20:01,971 --> 00:20:04,740
"A friend" never has sex.
"First name" might...

208
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:07,778
Yeah! "First name" gets you there...

209
00:20:07,911 --> 00:20:10,414
- "Family name" is a sure score.
- Yes!

210
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:13,549
- "Family name" is kind of pervy...
- Come here, "López"...

211
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,085
Yeah, there is something like...

212
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:18,465
- "Cute" is a death warrant.
- "Cute" never scores.

213
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:21,431
- Nickname! "Nickname" gets lucky.
- It depends on the nickname!

214
00:20:22,593 --> 00:20:26,464
- "How are you doing, sir?"
- That's the same as "López".

215
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:28,466
We're back on the pervy path...

216
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:31,642
"Boss" is a winner.
"Boss" always gets the job done.

217
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:34,271
Yeah! That's master level!

218
00:20:34,272 --> 00:20:36,581
So then let's stop using "boss"
among ourselves, dude.

219
00:20:43,716 --> 00:20:46,855
- What's so funny, dude?
- What?

220
00:20:47,854 --> 00:20:50,423
We're in the middle
of a tragedy here, man.

221
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:53,927
- What? Me? A tragedy?
- But it is a tragedy!

222
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,534
But it's funny, dude!
It's funny seeing myself here.

223
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,971
Two days ago
I couldn't picture myself anywhere.

224
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:03,845
Do you know where I was two days ago?

225
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:07,382
Owner's association meeting
at my building. The death star.

226
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,452
Do you remember
the garbage compactor scene?

227
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:14,285
That was me! Trying to fix my suit,
in a shitty state of mind...

228
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:18,887
The pits!
Now this is another galaxy!

229
00:21:19,054 --> 00:21:21,221
This is Dagoba.
Yoda is here...

230
00:21:21,222 --> 00:21:23,203
The bugs, my friends...

231
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,769
I'm taking out the ship
with my mind now.

232
00:21:25,995 --> 00:21:27,872
- Get it?
- Cool!

233
00:21:28,164 --> 00:21:30,733
You know what man?
Any chick I have to date,

234
00:21:30,734 --> 00:21:33,441
...has to understand this.

235
00:21:33,803 --> 00:21:36,045
- You farted, dude!
- No way!

236
00:21:36,306 --> 00:21:38,183
- You farted, man!
- Get out of here!

237
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,143
- Portela?
- Goldstein.

238
00:21:41,144 --> 00:21:43,479
- You farted in the square!
- Stop!

239
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,518
- Who is it?
- Goldstein!

240
00:21:45,616 --> 00:21:49,189
Tell that motherfucker to text me back!

241
00:21:50,388 --> 00:21:52,664
- Hey, Goldstein!
- Juan.

242
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:55,837
I crashed and burned
with Figueroa, Juan.

243
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:58,442
Then it was not going so well...

244
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:01,574
I thought it was...
I did everything right.

245
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:04,675
All I didn't do before.
Combed my hear, trimmed my beard...

246
00:22:07,606 --> 00:22:11,418
The minute she stepped inside
I had to start working her.

247
00:22:12,878 --> 00:22:16,918
- Really!
- I saw a shadow park on her face.

248
00:22:17,116 --> 00:22:19,756
The shadow of doubt, boss.

249
00:22:20,286 --> 00:22:25,930
She must have thought I had a crib,
one of those with a cool kitchen.

250
00:22:27,228 --> 00:22:30,471
Since I have no idea what happened
I left something prepared.

251
00:22:30,998 --> 00:22:32,979
Okay. I'm on my way.

252
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:52,258
I didn't touch a thing.
The untainted crime scene.

253
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,030
It looks like Martin Luther King's
untouched breakfast.

254
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:59,934
Okay... Let's see what we can read here.

255
00:23:00,931 --> 00:23:04,901
- Tell me a bit more.
- I don't know what to tell you.

256
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:08,581
I was doing three things at once.
Cooking, entertaining...

257
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:11,009
...and working her.

258
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:13,054
- What did she bring?
- Nothing.

259
00:23:19,117 --> 00:23:20,824
- She used this one.
- Nice.

260
00:23:21,286 --> 00:23:25,827
She'd told me she liked singing, so
I downloaded some Rafaela Carrá songs.

261
00:23:29,595 --> 00:23:32,234
- Did she sing?
- Yes. "Pedro Pe".

262
00:23:32,797 --> 00:23:34,745
"The best of all Santa Fe".

263
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,609
- How much did you drink?
- Just that. Not much.

264
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:43,685
- Did she eat?
- Only a bite.

265
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:46,715
The worst breaded meat ever...

266
00:23:48,982 --> 00:23:54,092
- How did she leave?
- Walking. I walked her.

267
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:57,798
- Why did you walk her?
- She lives seven blocks away.

268
00:23:58,025 --> 00:24:00,869
Too close to take a taxi,
too far to let her go by herself.

269
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:04,939
The odd thing is,
when I was coming back home...

270
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:09,172
I zigzagged across an entire block.
Along Corrientes, from Pringles to Yatay.

271
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:12,715
- You zigzagged?
- Not an ounce of booze in my system...

272
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:15,289
You weren't drunk.

273
00:24:15,677 --> 00:24:19,386
She gave me...
a kiss, and told me...

274
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:21,753
"Take Corrientes, it's safer".

275
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:25,127
- How was that kiss?
- A quick one, no tongue.

276
00:24:25,556 --> 00:24:27,536
This quick?

277
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,074
No, it was rather like this.

278
00:24:35,165 --> 00:24:38,544
She told me:
"Take Corrientes, it's safer."

279
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:40,810
And she gave me a last kiss.

280
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,712
- She gave you Freddo's kiss.
- Exactly!

281
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:45,854
The death kiss.

282
00:24:45,976 --> 00:24:49,083
- How many glasses did she drink?
- Just that one.

283
00:24:50,081 --> 00:24:52,425
- How many previous dates?
- Three.

284
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,730
- You always treated before?
- Yes.

285
00:24:58,658 --> 00:25:03,461
Okay...

286
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:05,443
So you were...

287
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,838
Two dates away from her
peeing with the door open.

288
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,211
You said she brought nothing
and you always treated.

289
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,285
From that we can figure out
she thinks of the man as a provider.

290
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:20,058
You felt she had you
doing the hard work...

291
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:23,227
And then she filled your house
with signals. For example:

292
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:26,492
The glass. Her glass!

293
00:25:27,422 --> 00:25:31,893
She probably took just one or two sips.
But left it very near the edge.

294
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:37,974
This shows... Insecurity...
Or a tragedy about to happen.

295
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,815
The napkin! Folded as if she hadn't
ever used it. As if she hadn't been here.

296
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:48,155
What about her singing?

297
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:51,619
- She wouldn't have sung if uncomfortable.
- Vanity.

298
00:25:51,781 --> 00:25:55,388
Vanity!
That woman has no feelings.

299
00:25:55,452 --> 00:25:58,433
She had you working,
but it was she who quit.

300
00:25:59,523 --> 00:26:02,526
That woman wants to be maintained.

301
00:26:03,694 --> 00:26:07,797
Probably to fulfill any of her whims,
being such an unfulfilled woman. Like gym.

302
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:11,802
That woman doesn't fuck!
She makes love.

303
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:14,943
That woman doesn't surrender her secret
because she simply doesn't have one.

304
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,647
And the same way she involuntary
left all these signals...

305
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,345
she also left another one...
One that defines her even more.

306
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,984
She also left another one...
One that defines her even more.

307
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:31,101
Today you're disconcerted.

308
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,869
Something clicked inside of me.
I still can't understand what.

309
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,634
Figueroa is just like this mark.

310
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:44,415
This mark that is no longer here...

311
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:47,848
and her, who surrendered
a long time ago.

312
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:51,690
We missed you, Juan.

313
00:27:09,732 --> 00:27:12,909
<i>"Everything you find."</i>

314
00:27:13,736 --> 00:27:16,774
<i>"Makes you surprise."</i>

315
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:20,586
<i>"The world is so wonderful</i>

316
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:24,420
<i>"Your eyes let you see it."</i>

317
00:27:24,948 --> 00:27:28,328
<i>"And what's left of me?"</i>

318
00:27:28,718 --> 00:27:32,131
<i>"If I doubt even with my heart."</i>

319
00:27:32,422 --> 00:27:35,199
<i>"I must shout."</i>

320
00:27:36,294 --> 00:27:38,068
<i>"That Pm a wizard."</i>

321
00:27:38,296 --> 00:27:41,903
<i>"The 'mambo' genius.
who no one can beat at dancing."</i>

322
00:27:55,447 --> 00:27:58,394
The apartment is nice.
Kind of small, but nice.

323
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,230
It has a small balcony...
It's okay!

324
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,970
What do you want me to tell you, mom?
Let's dine and I'll explain...

325
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:10,441
We'll be more relaxed.

326
00:28:11,865 --> 00:28:14,869
No mom! I'm fine.
Can you understand that?

327
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,783
I don't need a setup. I'm fine.
Do you want me to be okay?

328
00:28:19,941 --> 00:28:22,784
<i>"I wish I knew."</i>

329
00:28:23,712 --> 00:28:26,955
<i>"What you say about me."</i>

330
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:30,589
<i>"When I'm not at your side."</i>

331
00:28:31,153 --> 00:28:34,827
<i>"That makes you love me even more."</i>

332
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:38,701
<i>"And what's left of me."</i>

333
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:42,697
<i>"If I doubt even with my heart."</i>

334
00:28:42,698 --> 00:28:44,678
<i>"I must yell."</i>

335
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:48,241
<i>"That Pm a wizard."</i>

336
00:28:48,372 --> 00:28:52,320
<i>'The "mambo" genius,
who no one can beat at dancing."</i>

337
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:32,855
We've to come up
with something more solid, dude...

338
00:29:33,653 --> 00:29:39,598
The silent tag!
Yes! Running around the office...

339
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:43,301
Is an icebreaker,
we'll get more relaxed.

340
00:29:43,763 --> 00:29:47,110
The office looks
like a school playground.

341
00:29:47,234 --> 00:29:49,646
I don't really see it.

342
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,579
- No.
- It's done!

343
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:55,677
<i>- I'll bring bags of ice.
- Bags of ice? What for?</i>

344
00:29:56,043 --> 00:30:00,390
What do you mean "what for", Juan?
For the presentation! What else?

345
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:02,563
To break the ice.

346
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:05,592
Totally! I forgot to mention
the "Musical Tutti Frutti"!

347
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:09,531
- Did I mention it?
- Listen. I have to go in here.

348
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:12,671
You know what?
I think Big Fish is the clue...

349
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:16,365
- You should think on that.
- You're kind of sleek guy...

350
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,448
But does he mean the movie?
Actual fishing?

351
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:23,049
Listen, I don't want to be rude.

352
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:26,645
I just don't think it's worth
the extra hours after work.

353
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:29,287
This isn't school homework.

354
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,951
- Okay. Are you upset for your divorce?
- It's not the divorce.

355
00:30:33,218 --> 00:30:35,129
- You're not?
- No.

356
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:52,740
- What are you looking for?
- A colander...

357
00:30:54,775 --> 00:30:56,814
This is nice.

358
00:30:58,077 --> 00:30:59,785
- "Kneel".
- What?

359
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:01,247
"Kneel", Juan!

360
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:04,195
- Don't you know the game?
- No, I don't.

361
00:31:04,251 --> 00:31:08,097
It's the same as the chairs game.
Only without chairs.

362
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:11,997
And without music.
Someone says: "kneel".

363
00:31:12,493 --> 00:31:15,134
Everyone has to kneel
no matter what they're doing.

364
00:31:15,363 --> 00:31:19,778
We can switch leaders every hour
and play it in the office.

365
00:31:20,134 --> 00:31:22,672
It's nice... the colander...

366
00:31:23,072 --> 00:31:25,848
Right? I like it...

367
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:33,354
- I'm your father... I'm your father...
- Give it back! I'm buying it.

368
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:35,854
Hold it.

369
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:39,100
- Hey!
- It works perfectly. Excuse me!

370
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,262
Hi. We're taking this one.
Can you gift wrap it?

371
00:31:44,461 --> 00:31:47,602
- Your turn.
- Close City reactor control.

372
00:31:47,964 --> 00:31:50,535
-250.
- Here's the cash.

373
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:54,980
- Come to daddy.
- He's about to brake his record. Will he?

374
00:31:55,138 --> 00:31:57,119
Oh, no!

375
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,351
Can you turn
that fucking cell phone, Juan?

376
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:06,761
- I told you. She is a sex addict.
- Is Goldstein coming?

377
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:09,464
Goldstein is driven
by his new obsession...

378
00:32:09,688 --> 00:32:11,998
Corrientes Street,
between Pringles and Yatay.

379
00:32:12,124 --> 00:32:15,004
- Oh, what the fuck...
- Some bullshit about a romantic zigzag.

380
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:18,740
Hello!
I haven't make up my mind yet.

381
00:32:18,998 --> 00:32:22,571
It's a weekend.
Can we talk on Monday?

382
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:27,179
A brainstorming breakfast?
Aren't you taking this too seriously?

383
00:32:27,841 --> 00:32:32,449
No, you do it and then let me know.
Okay.

384
00:32:33,147 --> 00:32:35,719
- Talk!
- And speak the truth.

385
00:32:35,982 --> 00:32:40,194
- It's a work related call.
- Hold it there! Boss!

386
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:44,559
Where is Portela?
Argentine? Spain? Thailand?

387
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:48,034
Is she alive? Giving input?
Paying taxes? Doing Pilates?

388
00:32:48,263 --> 00:32:51,241
She is only a fuck buddy. Although
she said she wanted to go out to dinner.

389
00:32:51,432 --> 00:32:54,471
She actually pronounced the words?

390
00:32:54,603 --> 00:32:56,240
- She mentioned it.
- Not the same thing.

391
00:32:56,472 --> 00:32:58,576
She'd be the ideal woman if it weren't
that she is not the ideal woman.

392
00:32:58,806 --> 00:33:01,288
Only that's the one
who thinks she is funny.

393
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:03,148
You're not bringing her
here again, Juan.

394
00:33:03,412 --> 00:33:06,490
She's the one who says:
"I stop talking and here comes laughter".

395
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:11,190
She lives in French and Berutti, boss.
Luciana Portela...

396
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:14,135
She is not Luciana!
Which one is Luciana?

397
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:17,099
Luciana is the one who works with me.
Mommy's girl from the south.

398
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:19,575
Tag girl!

399
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:25,209
- It's a record! It's a record!
- Did you make love to her?

400
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,708
"Made love"? When did you start
talking like that, dude?

401
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,513
Did you make love to her?

402
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:34,052
Turn that fucking cell
off once and for all!

403
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,923
No! You listen to me!

404
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:42,231
Write down my email.
Email me.

405
00:33:42,955 --> 00:33:46,460
Juanmarvel@gmail.
Okay.

406
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:57,313
Twins that don't look alike?
Isn't it scientifically impossible?

407
00:33:57,705 --> 00:34:01,345
Not sure. That's the way
they introduced themselves.

408
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:05,622
The title rings a bell anyway...

409
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:08,655
- What was her name?
- Melina.

410
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:12,459
Melina?
And her sister?

411
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,127
I don't know. I barely remember Melina.
I was only 14.

412
00:34:18,693 --> 00:34:21,004
- I don't know...
- Melina...

413
00:34:21,663 --> 00:34:23,643
Melina...

414
00:34:23,798 --> 00:34:28,849
Melina had sort of a crush on me.
But nothing ever happened.

415
00:34:30,205 --> 00:34:32,186
Soledad.

416
00:34:32,742 --> 00:34:34,551
Soledad.
Sole?

417
00:34:35,044 --> 00:34:36,991
- Sole?
- Yes. I couldn't tell...

418
00:34:37,147 --> 00:34:42,255
Oh no, dude! No!
We'd already made plans...

419
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:46,497
- I can't believe it, man!
- It's done.

420
00:34:46,923 --> 00:34:49,631
Okay. It's all good.

421
00:34:49,861 --> 00:34:53,206
Easy. Relax.
You're looking good.

422
00:34:54,232 --> 00:34:56,610
I'd rather look good than feel good.

423
00:34:59,036 --> 00:35:01,009
Hello!

424
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:05,585
What Melina? What Soledad?
Oh yeah! Come in.

425
00:35:22,396 --> 00:35:25,069
- Welcome!
- Hi!

426
00:35:25,598 --> 00:35:28,205
Come in. Goldstein,
a good friend. Meli...

427
00:35:28,436 --> 00:35:30,575
- Sole.
- Sole, Goldstein.

428
00:35:30,805 --> 00:35:32,644
- How are you doing?
- Good!

429
00:35:32,907 --> 00:35:35,410
- Have a sit and a drink...
- I can't remember when you called...

430
00:35:52,427 --> 00:35:54,408
This is not working...

431
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:02,913
- I have a game for you.
- Oh! The player!

432
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,978
- Do you remember? These two are crazy.
- Totally! I remember now.

433
00:36:07,211 --> 00:36:11,216
- I didn't remember...
- Let me guess...

434
00:36:11,615 --> 00:36:15,324
- You're coming up with it just now.
- I'm still thinking the last details.

435
00:36:15,787 --> 00:36:19,758
Look at him!
He's on a journey right now...

436
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:23,399
Juan is on a journey
to his most glorious past.

437
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:28,645
When he was 14.
The "game master" we used to call him.

438
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:34,111
I can see you coming up with a new game.
You motherfucker.

439
00:36:34,506 --> 00:36:37,787
You're there...
You were so cute, Juan.

440
00:36:39,678 --> 00:36:44,890
The creator of "The shower test"...
now presents...

441
00:36:45,651 --> 00:36:50,123
So a couple of days ago,
my friend Goldstein was heartbroken.

442
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:52,337
C'mon, dude!

443
00:36:53,193 --> 00:36:56,970
And since this is a reunion for me also,
I worry...

444
00:36:57,364 --> 00:37:01,279
and try to think what's best
to help him.

445
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,141
So I guess maybe it's going out
and meeting new people...

446
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,615
- That might be...
- No new people.

447
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:14,327
So, to the question
of what might salvage this night

448
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:19,060
- A double answer appeared.
- The double answer.

449
00:37:19,955 --> 00:37:21,935
So what's the double answer?

450
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:25,366
Whatever works for Goldstein
has to work for us four.

451
00:37:25,462 --> 00:37:27,442
And for the night.

452
00:37:27,563 --> 00:37:31,808
What would work for Goldstein,
for us and for the night also?

453
00:37:32,068 --> 00:37:34,549
Such a long question
doesn't deserve a short answer...

454
00:37:35,605 --> 00:37:39,816
This is how the story goes.
Each one of you has to pick a name.

455
00:37:40,045 --> 00:37:41,855
Men have to pick
between Héctor and Osvaldo.

456
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,618
Women, between Liliana and Graciela.

457
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:48,155
These four names
live in a parallel world.

458
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:51,195
And are waiting for four bodies
to come alive.

459
00:37:51,423 --> 00:37:55,701
In this parallel world,
there's a safe mode to play this game.

460
00:37:56,629 --> 00:37:59,231
- Please allow me.
- Explain.

461
00:37:59,598 --> 00:38:04,672
In this parallel world, Liliana
and Graciela go to different rooms.

462
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:07,616
In this parallel world
there's a kitchen,

463
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,378
where Héctor and Osvaldo
wait for 5 minutes.

464
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:14,891
Who would have said! Your parallel world
is very much like this apartment.

465
00:38:15,082 --> 00:38:17,288
From then on, we have 15 minutes.

466
00:38:17,484 --> 00:38:20,931
- Turning the light on is forbidden.
- Totally forbidden.

467
00:38:21,155 --> 00:38:23,930
That's the only forbidden thing
in the parallel world.

468
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:27,396
After the first 15 minutes,
Goldstein shouts...

469
00:38:27,629 --> 00:38:31,508
- Fifteen!
- That's when the men switch rooms.

470
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:35,212
After a new 15 minutes,
Goldstein shouts...

471
00:38:35,502 --> 00:38:39,918
- Fifteen.
- It's then that we gather here and debate.

472
00:38:40,508 --> 00:38:44,218
Those 15 minutes in the dark
mean absolute freedom.

473
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,457
- Anything can happen.
- Have you played it before?

474
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:51,164
- Of course not. He just came up with it.
- Maybe we did.

475
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,764
The thing is, whatever happens
in the parallel world...

476
00:38:55,025 --> 00:38:57,005
Stays in the parallel world.

477
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:01,007
Is this your way of proposing an orgy?
You call me after God knows how long,

478
00:39:01,165 --> 00:39:03,201
just to get into a foursome
with my sister and I?

479
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,447
- Are you for real?
- You're missing the point...

480
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,549
Listen, I loved getting your call...
I really did.

481
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:13,583
I missed you all this time.
And all you wanted was...

482
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:17,822
The truth is I look at you,
and don't know who I am.

483
00:39:18,183 --> 00:39:21,288
- I mean, don't know who you are.
- Let it go, sis...

484
00:39:21,652 --> 00:39:24,361
- Thank you for this awful night...
- Melina?

485
00:39:24,523 --> 00:39:28,061
Here.
A bit of magic.

486
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:42,720
- Here.
- "Kneel", Juan.

487
00:39:43,476 --> 00:39:45,684
It's the best choice.
Give it some thought.

488
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:48,959
- It could be a lot of fun.
- A whole day with that?

489
00:39:49,549 --> 00:39:52,360
- I think it's too much.
- But that's the thing, Juan!

490
00:39:52,587 --> 00:39:55,192
If we only play it for a while,
it's a downer.

491
00:39:55,422 --> 00:39:57,869
But if we play it for...
say ten hours!

492
00:39:58,093 --> 00:40:02,040
Or eleven, or twelve
and 35 minutes and a half.

493
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:05,277
We're going to have a blast.

494
00:40:06,034 --> 00:40:08,845
I still don't get it.

495
00:40:09,504 --> 00:40:11,484
Check that.

496
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:19,351
- Poor guy!
- Terrible! That guy's sweater is terrible.

497
00:40:19,782 --> 00:40:23,025
If I ever see you in a sweater like that
I'd fucking kill you.

498
00:40:24,186 --> 00:40:27,134
- Did you bring salt?
- No.

499
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,235
That's good!

500
00:40:30,427 --> 00:40:36,105
I dated for two years
with a guy that loved salt.

501
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,743
- He loved salt?
- He didn't just loved it.

502
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:41,612
He was a salt fanatic.

503
00:40:41,738 --> 00:40:44,049
On our second date,
he took me to dine...

504
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:47,381
When I came back from the WC
the guy'd opened seven salt envelopes.

505
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:51,254
He had a pile of salt on the table
and was licking it with his fingertip.

506
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:57,893
When I marry, one of my dreams
is to re-enact the way I met my boyfriend.

507
00:40:58,357 --> 00:41:00,064
Really?
How's that?

508
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:04,101
Like I tell it.
We both play our roles.

509
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:08,637
- You have to know the fairies...
- The fairies?

510
00:41:08,768 --> 00:41:11,214
Yes, Juan! The Banfield fairies.
My friends.

511
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:14,952
They're really cool. Although...

512
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:18,719
They always get it wrong with boys.
Always.

513
00:41:19,713 --> 00:41:21,694
Do you know who I have a crush on?

514
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,926
<i>Arum?
w'.</i>

515
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:27,988
Iv"?
- Yes! "V"! I have a crush on

516
00:41:27,989 --> 00:41:31,527
I love "V".
I'm mad in love with "V"!

517
00:41:31,992 --> 00:41:36,807
Even though I've never seen his face.
It's better this way? Right?

518
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:39,337
Just think about it.
I can...

519
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:43,174
Just get whoever I like and put him
inside of V. Put his mask on.

520
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:46,644
There you have. The two men
I like most together in one.

521
00:41:47,111 --> 00:41:49,522
- It's the perfect man.
- Oh! Are you talking about V?

522
00:41:49,978 --> 00:41:52,187
V of Vendetta?
The Comic by Alan Moore?

523
00:41:53,884 --> 00:41:55,863
No... Yes!

524
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:58,266
I don't know who's it is.

525
00:41:58,355 --> 00:42:01,859
- What are you doing today?
- I don't know yet.

526
00:42:02,961 --> 00:42:05,736
Okay...
Do you dare come to Banfield?

527
00:42:06,197 --> 00:42:10,612
Right now driving for an hour already.
We're going fucking somewhere with Juan.

528
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:14,041
This is bullshit!
Where are we going?

529
00:42:14,173 --> 00:42:16,449
- To Banfield.
- Motherfucking Banfield!

530
00:42:16,674 --> 00:42:19,554
- When are we getting there?
- I don't know...

531
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:21,621
- Who're we meeting?
- Luciana...

532
00:42:21,847 --> 00:42:23,884
Cut the crap, man!
I think Luciana's.

533
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:30,560
Someone from work.
Juan's fucking secretary.

534
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:33,928
Yes...
So?

535
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:38,473
- Apparently she's got friends.
- She's got friends.

536
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:42,472
- Hold on. Who are them?
- She calls them "the fairies".

537
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:46,149
She...
Hold on. Let me call you back.

538
00:42:47,407 --> 00:42:51,356
- Cut the crap, Juan. What "fairies"?
- "The Banfield Fairies".

539
00:42:52,146 --> 00:42:53,922
- What "fairies", Juan?
- That's what she calls them!

540
00:42:54,149 --> 00:42:57,152
- But how many are them?
- I don't know. Many.

541
00:42:57,385 --> 00:43:00,265
- Call them then, I'm fucking lost.
- Okay...

542
00:43:00,489 --> 00:43:03,697
- Chill out, man!
- But I've been driving for an hour!

543
00:43:03,826 --> 00:43:05,807
My head is going to blow up!

544
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:08,673
I can't believe
the things I do for you, Juan.

545
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:11,070
- I'm calling now.
- Is it ringing?

546
00:43:11,301 --> 00:43:14,748
Yeah, it's ringing.
Hey, Luciana!

547
00:43:15,938 --> 00:43:18,283
- Give it to me!
- Hold on!

548
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,118
- We're lost.
- I'm not lost.

549
00:43:25,448 --> 00:43:27,828
We just went by "Veneciana".

550
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:33,928
- Make a left here!
- Where?

551
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,105
Make a left now!

552
00:43:36,928 --> 00:43:40,068
- See ya!
- Can't you see my signal?

553
00:43:40,398 --> 00:43:42,969
- This one here.
- This one, Juan?

554
00:43:43,201 --> 00:43:45,408
- Yes! This one!
- Okay.

555
00:43:47,306 --> 00:43:49,216
- Lock your door.
- Okay...

556
00:43:53,613 --> 00:43:55,820
- Lock your door!
- Yeah!

557
00:44:00,353 --> 00:44:02,960
What are you doing, Nico?
Nico!

558
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:06,063
- What are you doing?
- You let me do it my way!

559
00:44:06,292 --> 00:44:08,273
Johnny!

560
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,234
- How are you?
- Good!

561
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:13,240
- Your friend?
- Hey there!

562
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:15,936
- "Movie Buff", Luciana.
- Hi Luciana.

563
00:44:16,104 --> 00:44:18,710
- Fine and you?
- Fine. What a nice house!

564
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,285
Super nice!

565
00:44:25,481 --> 00:44:26,653
Mom!

566
00:44:27,283 --> 00:44:30,162
This is Juan,
and his friend, Movie Buff.

567
00:44:30,385 --> 00:44:32,887
- Good evening.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

568
00:44:32,888 --> 00:44:34,868
Good evening.
Nice to meet you.

569
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:38,802
Allow me to tell you.
I can smell the peace inside this house.

570
00:44:38,894 --> 00:44:40,874
And I can see it too.

571
00:44:41,463 --> 00:44:46,413
As I witness, how you two share your mate.
Our Argentine heritage.

572
00:44:46,569 --> 00:44:49,551
I took the liberty
of bringing this box full of candy...

573
00:44:49,773 --> 00:44:53,654
Since I'm on the candy
distribution business.

574
00:44:53,978 --> 00:44:57,686
- You shouldn't have bothered.
- Please. Help yourselves.

575
00:45:07,426 --> 00:45:09,405
There they are...

576
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:17,148
Do it again. Do it again!

577
00:45:19,071 --> 00:45:21,051
Kneel!

578
00:45:22,909 --> 00:45:24,889
Kneel, you moron!

579
00:45:25,845 --> 00:45:28,292
So, this are Juan and Movie Buff.

580
00:45:28,481 --> 00:45:31,985
- Hello.
- She is Maru, the brown fairy.

581
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:35,267
Euge, the green fairy.

582
00:45:35,756 --> 00:45:37,736
Romi, the pink fairy.

583
00:45:39,461 --> 00:45:41,440
And Ari.

584
00:45:43,298 --> 00:45:45,599
It's called "The Human Misery".

585
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,604
I want to make a short film
based on a game I was told about.

586
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:53,582
- We can all play a role!
- I want to be in it!

587
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,723
It's like role playing.
One plays the policeman...

588
00:46:02,652 --> 00:46:05,689
Another is the killer,
the rest are victims.

589
00:46:06,422 --> 00:46:10,599
The policeman needs to catch the killer,
before he kills his victims.

590
00:46:10,894 --> 00:46:13,966
You play seated
and looking into each other's eyes.

591
00:46:14,297 --> 00:46:17,176
You uncover the killer
by making questions.

592
00:46:17,634 --> 00:46:19,672
The game is basically that.

593
00:46:20,138 --> 00:46:22,641
I don't know why, but I have the feeling
it could be a good short movie.

594
00:46:22,907 --> 00:46:25,945
- Yeah! Definitely!
- Let's all be a part of it.

595
00:46:26,244 --> 00:46:28,450
I think mystery is a good-

596
00:46:30,213 --> 00:46:34,960
I've never played it.
So I thought we could play it now.

597
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,100
- Yeah!
- Yes!

598
00:46:38,057 --> 00:46:40,037
- Now! Now!
- Wait a second!

599
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:44,138
Are you telling me you want to make
a short film based on a game?

600
00:46:44,364 --> 00:46:48,369
A game you never played?
Why don't you explain it to me?

601
00:46:50,236 --> 00:46:52,215
It's like role game.

602
00:46:53,138 --> 00:46:56,450
One plays the policeman.
Another plays the killer.

603
00:46:56,876 --> 00:47:00,051
The rest are victims.
The policeman...

604
00:47:02,515 --> 00:47:06,123
- The policeman?
- The policeman...

605
00:47:06,487 --> 00:47:09,934
has to uncover the killer
before he kills his victims.

606
00:47:10,224 --> 00:47:12,865
You play seated
and staring into each other's eyes.

607
00:47:13,561 --> 00:47:16,702
You uncover the killer
by asking questions.

608
00:47:17,432 --> 00:47:19,412
That's basically it.

609
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:24,213
I don't know why, but I have the feeling
it could be a good short movie.

610
00:47:24,573 --> 00:47:27,953
- Totally.
- Yes. I'm totally sold.

611
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:32,885
Since I never played it,
I thought we could play it now.

612
00:47:33,984 --> 00:47:36,793
It's excellent!
This is excellent.

613
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:45,005
- You need a bit of acting.
- Yes! We can all act!

614
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,403
If acting is required...
Movie Buff here...

615
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,842
Is an excellent retired actor...

616
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:54,082
- You're famous!
- Your face looked familiar...

617
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:56,012
Yeah! I thought I knew you
from somewhere.

618
00:47:56,173 --> 00:48:00,919
Movie Buff had a one-man show
about Jim Morrison's last 48 hours.

619
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:02,353
"Who?
"Who?

620
00:48:02,481 --> 00:48:04,859
- Morrison's.
- Such a great actor.

621
00:48:05,083 --> 00:48:08,327
To get in the mood, he used
to stand on his hands for half an hour.

622
00:48:09,722 --> 00:48:11,167
- Really!
- C'mon!

623
00:48:11,924 --> 00:48:14,337
It's true! I did.

624
00:48:15,294 --> 00:48:19,334
- The play ended with Morrison dying-
- Who is Morrison?

625
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:23,811
- I didn't dare ask!
- Oh, sory!

626
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:27,213
- C'mon, Juan.
- Sorry...

627
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,545
I can't believe
you don't know who Morrison is.

628
00:48:32,013 --> 00:48:34,959
The Doors? The band?
The Doors' front man?

629
00:48:35,383 --> 00:48:37,795
He's knows too much about music!

630
00:48:38,786 --> 00:48:41,823
Why don't you do
a part of the show for us?

631
00:48:42,357 --> 00:48:44,337
- No, no!
- C'mon!

632
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:48,135
You dare do it in front
of three thousand and not six?

633
00:48:49,765 --> 00:48:52,245
- C'mon!
- Okay.

634
00:48:52,334 --> 00:48:57,249
Morrisey! Morrisey!
Morrisey! Morrisey!

635
00:48:57,473 --> 00:49:02,547
Nico, the Film Buff presents...
Morrison! His last hours.

636
00:49:11,322 --> 00:49:14,599
At this moment my mind roams
the territory of the unknown.

637
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,601
Nevertheless they seem close.

638
00:49:20,764 --> 00:49:24,611
The pigs.
The blood suckers.

639
00:49:25,236 --> 00:49:28,048
The hookers, the thieves,
the blow, the shit.

640
00:49:33,044 --> 00:49:35,524
An unstoppable feeling...

641
00:49:36,215 --> 00:49:39,163
A light at the end of the road
guides me.

642
00:49:39,986 --> 00:49:44,230
I realize that light is actually...
the end.

643
00:49:46,959 --> 00:49:50,099
And the end is...
perhaps...

644
00:49:50,664 --> 00:49:55,079
my only friend.
The end.

645
00:50:02,944 --> 00:50:04,923
Excellent!

646
00:50:07,214 --> 00:50:09,821
I have to say you were right, Juan.

647
00:50:10,019 --> 00:50:11,793
- About?
- Tonight.

648
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:14,262
A while ago
tonight was a night to forget,

649
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:17,169
almost like that night
when we didn't have any water.

650
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:19,171
Suddenly this night is unforgettable.

651
00:50:19,362 --> 00:50:22,501
The best night
in probably the last six months.

652
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:24,904
One of the top three for this year...
And Morrison...

653
00:50:25,135 --> 00:50:27,911
Let's talk about Morrison
and about what happened to me.

654
00:50:28,137 --> 00:50:31,416
The way I connected with the material,
the things I felt...

655
00:50:31,508 --> 00:50:33,419
How everything flowed...

656
00:50:33,543 --> 00:50:38,550
The way it makes me think...
About my friends, about what I do...

657
00:50:38,715 --> 00:50:42,129
About...
Money and all material things...

658
00:50:42,219 --> 00:50:45,928
The things that happen to me.
How I can't usually be the contrary...

659
00:50:46,557 --> 00:50:48,594
To be in touch
with so many more things...

660
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:51,229
Luciana's family!
Let's talk about her family.

661
00:50:52,163 --> 00:50:55,304
Extraordinary!
I mean: Extra-ordinary!

662
00:50:55,867 --> 00:50:59,338
Meaning... more than ordinary!
And the fairies!

663
00:50:59,571 --> 00:51:03,417
Let's talk about the fairies...
I know they're young...

664
00:51:03,842 --> 00:51:08,348
That they have small titties...
That they're missing pubes...

665
00:51:09,082 --> 00:51:11,756
But there's a reality
we need to discuss.

666
00:51:12,352 --> 00:51:17,165
These girls want to fuck...
And I want to fuck.

667
00:51:19,258 --> 00:51:23,106
If they want it and I want it,
we sit down, discuss it and do it. Period.

668
00:51:23,297 --> 00:51:27,746
There's no sense in arguing...
HOW TO GIVE 20,000 KISSES

669
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,537
We only need to choose one.
We'll get along...

670
00:51:30,538 --> 00:51:33,314
Juan.
Juan!

671
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:35,416
- Juan!
- Eow!

672
00:51:36,378 --> 00:51:38,357
Beware of this girl.

673
00:51:41,684 --> 00:51:43,424
I can't really get used
to the idea anyway.

674
00:51:45,988 --> 00:51:48,331
Do you really think An'
will really make that short movie?

675
00:51:48,656 --> 00:51:51,160
Of course!
Nowadays anyone can shoot.

676
00:51:51,527 --> 00:51:55,873
Just get a decent image, build a couple
of plot-lines, add some narrative...

677
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,179
It still works, doesn't it!

678
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:03,380
- It still works. Morrison.
- Yeah! They were all hooked.

679
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,850
It's amazing!
I keep doing it as time goes by...

680
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:11,589
The audience is moved, I touch them.
The girls were all focused, watching...

681
00:52:12,149 --> 00:52:15,791
The girls were all focused, watching...

682
00:52:16,721 --> 00:52:20,965
I still need to fine tune
the summersault at the beginning maybe...

683
00:52:25,497 --> 00:52:30,105
I drew a conclusion tonight, Juan.
Can I tell you something?

684
00:52:31,804 --> 00:52:37,686
- You and Luciana are imminent.
- You think so?

685
00:52:57,131 --> 00:53:00,978
- What's up?
- Fine.

686
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:08,843
- Was nice another day, isn't?
- Yes, was awesome!

687
00:53:10,045 --> 00:53:12,025
Yes, What's about "the fairies"?

688
00:53:12,515 --> 00:53:15,427
They're awesome.
You all seem like one.

689
00:53:16,084 --> 00:53:20,932
Totally!
It's like the best qualities of each...

690
00:53:21,357 --> 00:53:25,772
fuse into only one
and it seems the four of us make one.

691
00:53:26,395 --> 00:53:27,932
Like Voltron.

692
00:53:28,432 --> 00:53:31,276
Exactly! Like Voltron.
But you're the head.

693
00:53:31,434 --> 00:53:33,415
I am?

694
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:35,741
- What about Ari?
- He's cool.

695
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:41,690
Cool? Ari is awesome!
It's like he's almost our best friend.

696
00:53:42,113 --> 00:53:48,553
Besides... Can I tell you something?
I think he likes Euge.

697
00:53:50,822 --> 00:53:53,825
He's a guy anyway.
He likes whoever likes him back.

698
00:53:53,826 --> 00:53:56,467
He's changing all the time.
He is a good guy anyway.

699
00:53:56,662 --> 00:54:01,941
He's a really nice guy.
I hope he makes the short movie.

700
00:54:02,669 --> 00:54:06,047
It'd be fun.
Besides I...

701
00:54:07,774 --> 00:54:10,618
Sort of I like acting.
Not professionally though.

702
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:15,319
- Did you know I wrote a story?
- Did you have a black book also?

703
00:54:16,016 --> 00:54:22,059
No, I had a book were I used to write...
Stories, poems. They all sucked.

704
00:54:22,822 --> 00:54:24,803
Eventually I stopped.

705
00:54:26,327 --> 00:54:29,069
I also have a notebook
where I write poetry.

706
00:54:29,397 --> 00:54:30,775
Really?

707
00:54:30,966 --> 00:54:34,242
- I want to read it.
- No! No way.

708
00:54:37,506 --> 00:54:39,281
What's your story about?

709
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:43,179
It might be usable
to do a short movie...

710
00:54:43,378 --> 00:54:46,986
- A very amateur one...
- Totally!

711
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:52,828
- Lucy... In the sky with diamonds...
- How are you doing, mister?

712
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:59,200
- How are you guys doing?
- Just chatting with Johnny.

713
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:03,375
- Do you have plans for tonight?
- Not much.

714
00:55:04,736 --> 00:55:07,978
But it doesn't mean
I'll agree to anything, anyway.

715
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:09,676
- Tell her.
- Let's hear it.

716
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:12,548
If you're in the mood,
we'll be at home.

717
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:18,293
Drinks... Music...
And if you're into it... Brownies!

718
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:26,934
We're going to sing a couple of songs...

719
00:55:27,594 --> 00:55:30,403
Laguerra here,
is a killer guitar player.

720
00:55:30,763 --> 00:55:35,144
I like it. Count on me.
Wanna come?

721
00:55:37,169 --> 00:55:42,552
- Bring a couple of friends.
- Relax... Relax, okay?

722
00:55:42,909 --> 00:55:45,389
I'll see what I can get.

723
00:55:50,518 --> 00:55:52,828
They're so cute, right?

724
00:56:22,786 --> 00:56:27,429
Now I want to love you...
till the end...

725
00:56:28,626 --> 00:56:30,971
- Julieta!
- Julieta!

726
00:56:31,662 --> 00:56:32,868
- So?
- Thinner...

727
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,767
Very good!
The Office band is very good!

728
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,413
Hang in there... I have an idea.
Follow my lead.

729
00:56:40,138 --> 00:56:44,143
So girls, do you know the game called
"The merry-go-round of love"?

730
00:56:45,177 --> 00:56:46,053
No.

731
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:50,159
It's simple.
Each guy gets into one of the rooms.

732
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:53,158
Every girl then randomly
gets inside a room.

733
00:56:53,419 --> 00:56:56,423
There we stay
until the girl gets tired, since...

734
00:56:56,689 --> 00:56:58,669
only the girls can get tired.

735
00:56:58,757 --> 00:57:03,707
They decide whether they stay or go,
us boys are slaves to your wishes.

736
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:08,936
When any girl is tired, she gets out of the room,
and gets inside the next room.

737
00:57:09,035 --> 00:57:13,416
The girl in that room has to inevitably get out,
and head to another room.

738
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:17,546
And that's the way
the merry-go-round of love starts turning.

739
00:57:18,046 --> 00:57:20,026
And what do you do in the room?

740
00:57:20,848 --> 00:57:23,523
Whatever both of them want.
Talking.

741
00:57:23,952 --> 00:57:25,932
Kissing, or nothing at all.

742
00:57:29,357 --> 00:57:32,861
Way to go Juan.
I had you for an ass, but...

743
00:57:33,796 --> 00:57:35,730
- How many rooms are there?
- Three.

744
00:57:35,731 --> 00:57:37,334
- Three plus a bathroom?
- Yes.

745
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:00,466
Come in!

746
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:18,712
- Thank God!
- Really?

747
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,723
I was cool
with the fairies coming anyway.

748
00:58:23,949 --> 00:58:26,089
- Really?
- Yes.

749
00:58:26,685 --> 00:58:30,328
- How's that?
- Maybe...

750
00:58:30,891 --> 00:58:34,702
Maybe what?
Maybe Laguerra was in the race...

751
00:58:35,229 --> 00:58:37,209
Well, I don't know!

752
00:58:37,464 --> 00:58:40,536
Not sure what I'd do
if Laguerra was in the race...

753
00:58:42,169 --> 00:58:44,149
Who would've thought...

754
00:58:55,584 --> 00:58:57,962
Remember about the short movie
I told you today?

755
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:05,800
- The short movie...
- Yes. What about it?

756
00:59:06,562 --> 00:59:09,042
<i>- I'll do it.
- Really?</i>

757
00:59:09,365 --> 00:59:12,074
- Yes. It's cool.
- Totally!

758
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:15,612
So... Would you like to be a part of it?

759
00:59:16,373 --> 00:59:17,977
- Me?
- You.

760
00:59:18,175 --> 00:59:19,950
- You mean me?
- You.

761
00:59:20,844 --> 00:59:22,187
No!

762
00:59:22,412 --> 00:59:24,756
- Really? How?
- Yes.

763
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:27,630
Well... You'd be the star!

764
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:35,034
Totally! Oh! I'm so happy!
I love it!

765
00:59:40,098 --> 00:59:42,533
Thanks!
It's what I've always wanted!

766
00:59:42,534 --> 00:59:45,242
I've always wanted
to act in a short movie.

767
01:00:04,124 --> 01:00:06,104
I need to...
Wow!

768
01:00:14,669 --> 01:00:16,649
Come in.

769
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:41,199
I have to apologize.

770
01:00:41,564 --> 01:00:45,103
- I hope you don't blacklist me.
- Never, boss.

771
01:00:46,135 --> 01:00:50,414
I want you to know this in-service I took
was the worst thing I've done ever.

772
01:00:52,443 --> 01:00:55,687
It took me into
an over awareness state...

773
01:00:57,247 --> 01:01:01,958
I feel bad all the time.
I see everyone sad, bored...

774
01:01:02,087 --> 01:01:06,798
Tense...
But actually... It's really me.

775
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:11,570
It's me who...
This guy Cachito...

776
01:01:12,098 --> 01:01:16,309
has you believing
everything is possible...

777
01:01:18,572 --> 01:01:20,642
- When it really isn't.
- Don't feel that way, boss!

778
01:01:20,773 --> 01:01:26,588
I feel anyway I fucking want to, Juan.
I'm sorry if I'm being blunt, Juan.

779
01:01:27,448 --> 01:01:29,017
Here...

780
01:01:29,117 --> 01:01:30,993
See these?
Remember these?

781
01:01:34,888 --> 01:01:38,530
It's over!
Enough with the games.

782
01:01:38,926 --> 01:01:40,906
Enough with originality.

783
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:46,170
When I was a kid...
I liked locking myself up in my room.

784
01:01:47,735 --> 01:01:51,741
I grabbed the bottle of cologne...
I always liked to sing...

785
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:57,015
So we're going to start
the "Karaoke Casual Fridays".

786
01:01:57,113 --> 01:02:00,059
And we're all going to sing.
We're all going to sing!

787
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:03,029
- So, Juan? Are you in the mood?
- Yes, I'm in the mood.

788
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,465
Juan is in the mood!

789
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:20,409
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know. I like it.

790
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:24,479
It's my favorite place in the office.

791
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:28,816
Hey...

792
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:33,827
I thought he'd like the "Kneel" game.

793
01:02:35,053 --> 01:02:39,297
I thought we were
right on track but no...

794
01:02:40,592 --> 01:02:44,700
- Will you let me come up with a rematch?
- Maybe we can go out this weekend?

795
01:02:46,165 --> 01:02:48,577
- Would go come to Banfield?
- Yes.

796
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:51,650
Why not?

797
01:02:53,407 --> 01:02:56,547
I can't make it this weekend anyway.

798
01:02:56,944 --> 01:03:00,915
I have a ton of things to do.
My mind is going to blow up.

799
01:03:04,586 --> 01:03:07,226
- So, I'll go.
- Hold on.

800
01:03:08,322 --> 01:03:10,804
I want to give you something.

801
01:03:15,096 --> 01:03:16,598
It's the story.

802
01:03:16,831 --> 01:03:21,473
For the short movie.
I want your opinion.

803
01:03:22,171 --> 01:03:25,243
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

804
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:33,527
Hello everyone.
What a night!

805
01:03:33,683 --> 01:03:38,290
Good! That's what I want to hear!
It's not working.

806
01:03:39,422 --> 01:03:42,301
The phrase
any girl doesn't want to hear.

807
01:03:43,293 --> 01:03:45,967
Right? I bet it's not
the first time, darling.

808
01:03:46,464 --> 01:03:49,809
You there, looking away.
"It's the first time this happens to me".

809
01:03:50,902 --> 01:03:55,438
Don't pay attention to what
the MC said about me, I'm no diva.

810
01:03:55,439 --> 01:03:59,650
Clearly I wouldn't be here light now
if I were a diva...

811
01:03:59,945 --> 01:04:03,348
My name wouldn't be
Andrea Portela either...

812
01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:07,057
I'd have a star name,
something similar to Gwyneth...

813
01:04:07,487 --> 01:04:11,434
Or a very fancy family name.

814
01:04:12,291 --> 01:04:15,637
So, today I left home as usual,

815
01:04:15,862 --> 01:04:19,435
and almost got run down
by a kid in his skate.

816
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,244
Death by a skater running you down...

817
01:04:23,637 --> 01:04:27,016
Is one of the saddest things
that can happen to you, isn't it?

818
01:04:27,441 --> 01:04:32,152
Obviously upset, I yelled at him:
"You motherfucking brat!"

819
01:04:32,279 --> 01:04:35,158
The kid stops,
turns around and looks at me.

820
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:40,030
A guy in his forties!
The jackass grabs his skate,

821
01:04:40,188 --> 01:04:43,795
puts it under his arm,
he thinks he looks really cool,

822
01:04:43,926 --> 01:04:49,569
approaches me and asks me on a date.
I look at him and ask him:

823
01:04:49,865 --> 01:04:52,538
"So you'll take me to dinner
on your skate!"

824
01:04:52,901 --> 01:04:56,543
I know the kind!
These are kids inside a grownup's body.

825
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:02,488
If they see you with some other guy
they throw a fit and question you.

826
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:08,186
But not with me, darling.
If you want the trendy skater shoes,

827
01:05:08,752 --> 01:05:11,199
if you want your trunks
and your cap and skate,

828
01:05:11,355 --> 01:05:15,327
you don't want me naked, darling!
You want a teenager.

829
01:05:15,759 --> 01:05:20,175
A teenager that by the time she grows up,
is going to kick your ass so hard,

830
01:05:20,398 --> 01:05:24,278
that you're going to need your skate
as a walker, darling!

831
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:28,250
Your ass will be so sore
that you won't be able to sit, you moron!

832
01:05:29,275 --> 01:05:34,749
Go to kid-land, go to teenage-land...
Go to get-lucky-land!

833
01:05:35,114 --> 01:05:40,258
Thank you! Good evening!
Go fuck yourself, motherfuckers!

834
01:05:40,887 --> 01:05:42,866
Thank you for coming!

835
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,339
Evening! Thank you for coming...

836
01:05:48,928 --> 01:05:52,000
How many couples...
You didn't have any better things to do?

837
01:05:53,034 --> 01:05:55,845
And you're here all alone...
So, I was saying...

838
01:06:06,415 --> 01:06:10,794
For some time now, I've been...
in a weird mood.

839
01:06:14,489 --> 01:06:17,698
I don't know...
I'm kind of dizzy...

840
01:06:19,262 --> 01:06:22,709
Luciana,
the girl who works with me...

841
01:06:27,203 --> 01:06:29,877
Is totally different from me.

842
01:06:31,742 --> 01:06:33,722
Nevertheless...

843
01:06:35,478 --> 01:06:39,450
There's something about her...
That...

844
01:06:42,921 --> 01:06:46,800
I can't read her.
I'm baffled.

845
01:06:48,293 --> 01:06:52,571
I just can't...
She's totally different.

846
01:06:56,568 --> 01:07:01,382
I think I...
I'm really into her.

847
01:07:25,665 --> 01:07:27,008
Is it good?

848
01:07:34,475 --> 01:07:36,455
<i>You're crazy!</i>

849
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:40,995
I'm crazy about you.

850
01:07:42,217 --> 01:07:43,491
<i>How?</i>

851
01:07:44,621 --> 01:07:48,591
I came to tell you this.
It was an impulse.

852
01:07:49,158 --> 01:07:51,537
I made all the trip to tell you...

853
01:07:53,295 --> 01:07:57,870
I don't think...
I'm crazy about you.

854
01:07:59,302 --> 01:08:01,681
In the most complete sense of the word.

855
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:07,990
I came to tell you that.

856
01:08:09,713 --> 01:08:15,392
I came to tell you that...
That any difference we may have...

857
01:08:17,722 --> 01:08:20,134
...are the things that attract me to you.

858
01:08:22,794 --> 01:08:27,244
I don't know...
You're... You're a riddle.

859
01:08:28,668 --> 01:08:30,649
A riddle?

860
01:08:34,474 --> 01:08:38,924
- Yes, look, before...
- Before your divorce?

861
01:08:39,378 --> 01:08:41,358
Before my divorce.

862
01:08:42,316 --> 01:08:44,296
I was living with a missus.

863
01:08:45,752 --> 01:08:50,132
My life was monotonous, plain, linear.

864
01:08:53,428 --> 01:08:55,839
Doing the dishes
was just doing the dishes...

865
01:08:56,030 --> 01:09:00,240
Sleeping was just sleeping.
Eating out was just eating out.

866
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:03,212
Do you get it?
Nothing was an adventure...

867
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:07,580
I started to get desperate.

868
01:09:08,109 --> 01:09:11,887
I started to say to myself:
"This isn't what you want".

869
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:16,495
"You're not doing yourself any good."
And...

870
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:21,031
One thinks he knows what he wants.

871
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,463
Until you come along.

872
01:09:30,601 --> 01:09:33,047
Now I know even less than before.

873
01:09:35,006 --> 01:09:36,985
But there's one thing I know.

874
01:09:40,478 --> 01:09:41,855
You.

875
01:09:50,222 --> 01:09:52,463
What you're telling me is so nice!

876
01:09:52,658 --> 01:09:55,298
No one ever talked to me
like that before.

877
01:10:00,766 --> 01:10:03,247
I don't know what else to say to you.

878
01:10:05,305 --> 01:10:07,684
You don't have to tell me anything...

879
01:10:08,342 --> 01:10:11,755
I felt the need.
I came here to tell you...

880
01:10:13,314 --> 01:10:15,294
That's it.

881
01:10:21,855 --> 01:10:23,831
Did you read the story?

882
01:10:35,503 --> 01:10:37,484
I fell for a dumb-ass!

883
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:40,685
- Why? What happened?
- I don't know.

884
01:10:40,942 --> 01:10:43,822
I don't know what happened,
but it's happening right now.

885
01:10:44,547 --> 01:10:47,392
The Movie Buff warned me
and I didn't pay attention...

886
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,394
She is out of her mind!

887
01:10:49,852 --> 01:10:55,132
I can't believe I have a crush on a girl
who doesn't know who Morrison is!

888
01:10:55,492 --> 01:11:00,738
That unfinished kiss was a mind twister.
It infected my brain.

889
01:11:01,466 --> 01:11:05,039
She is the opposite of Portela,
of the missus...

890
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:08,379
- Melina...
- No, it's not Melina.

891
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,520
- So there was an unfinished kiss?
- Yes.

892
01:11:13,112 --> 01:11:15,614
What kind of kiss?
Like this?

893
01:11:18,717 --> 01:11:20,923
No. Like this.

894
01:11:30,296 --> 01:11:32,434
Wanna go for a walk?
So...

895
01:11:32,767 --> 01:11:35,975
I took Corrientes on my way back...
Zigzagging...

896
01:11:37,804 --> 01:11:40,648
True. You told me. Here.

897
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:44,922
I was clean at that time.

898
01:11:46,814 --> 01:11:49,317
Specifically that night.
I hadn't used any.

899
01:11:50,752 --> 01:11:52,732
A sip of wine only.

900
01:11:52,887 --> 01:11:55,425
But I was zigzagging...
Really bad!

901
01:11:55,824 --> 01:11:57,804
Really bad!

902
01:12:00,762 --> 01:12:03,299
Right about here... I felt...

903
01:12:06,501 --> 01:12:09,813
I mean, I know this street by heart.

904
01:12:11,107 --> 01:12:14,088
I've walked it...
A thousand...

905
01:12:16,379 --> 01:12:20,829
A thousand times that night!
As if...

906
01:12:21,719 --> 01:12:27,567
The answer was somewhere...
Along this path. Understand me?

907
01:12:28,392 --> 01:12:30,373
It's simple.

908
01:12:30,795 --> 01:12:36,269
The only night I zigzagged...
was when I suited up.

909
01:12:36,968 --> 01:12:39,471
- That's it.
- I wasn't myself.

910
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:44,983
Figueroa was an iceberg anyway,
but I have no argument because,

911
01:12:45,644 --> 01:12:48,989
I didn't give her the chance
to meet the real Goldstein.

912
01:12:51,217 --> 01:12:53,698
- The one who she loved.
- Was not me.

913
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:55,799
You remember.

914
01:12:56,989 --> 01:12:58,093
Obviously.

915
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:00,869
It doesn't matter
if you fell for a dumb-ass.

916
01:13:01,528 --> 01:13:03,507
It doesn't matter

917
01:13:03,697 --> 01:13:06,644
if the girl you like
doesn't know who Morrison is.

918
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:08,711
That's not what matters.

919
01:13:09,002 --> 01:13:12,006
Because in the end, the fact that she
doesn't know is what you might love.

920
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:14,942
But, never suit up.

921
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:19,653
Relationships are just what they are.

922
01:13:20,381 --> 01:13:24,728
We can't ask them
to be any more or any less.

923
01:13:25,287 --> 01:13:28,201
Or to be something they're not.

924
01:13:29,258 --> 01:13:32,706
Because that leads to frustration.

925
01:13:32,861 --> 01:13:35,808
We fear the ephemeral.

926
01:13:36,632 --> 01:13:37,804
Do you understand?

927
01:13:38,066 --> 01:13:41,879
And that's what makes us
search in every girl...

928
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:44,486
...for the love of our life.

929
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:49,049
How long have
we've been zigzagging, Goldstein?

930
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:53,754
Sometimes I feel the city is...
Like my house backyard.

931
01:13:53,951 --> 01:13:55,932
Have I ever told you that?

932
01:13:58,122 --> 01:14:01,035
- Not once.
- Toss it!

933
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,166
- You say they're coming for us?
- Toss it away!

934
01:14:06,097 --> 01:14:08,077
Toss it away, man!

935
01:14:15,974 --> 01:14:20,253
C'mon!
Run: man! Run!

936
01:14:23,216 --> 01:14:25,197
Thanks, Lore...

937
01:14:26,653 --> 01:14:28,632
Ernesto!

938
01:14:31,491 --> 01:14:35,565
Figueroa!
Juan, a friend.

939
01:14:36,830 --> 01:14:40,368
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Lorena, a friend.

940
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:43,583
Nice to meet you.

941
01:14:44,873 --> 01:14:46,079
Bye!
Let's go.

942
01:14:47,475 --> 01:14:50,753
<i>"A friend told me
I'd find her some day."</i>

943
01:14:52,146 --> 01:14:56,994
<i>"in a fashion shop
At the soda fountain."</i>

944
01:14:58,120 --> 01:15:02,330
<i>"Dressed in wool gloves
and high heels."</i>

945
01:15:02,825 --> 01:15:07,672
<i>"With a giant beside
Holding a miracle in her hand."</i>

946
01:15:09,299 --> 01:15:13,475
<i>"He said some day
I was going to learn."</i>

947
01:15:13,937 --> 01:15:18,511
<i>"That I can't touch
what I can't hug."</i>

948
01:15:26,150 --> 01:15:30,292
<i>"it doesn't matter. I walked.
I thought. I decided to imagine."</i>

949
01:15:30,855 --> 01:15:35,771
<i>"A silent mermaid
A mountain of enchantment."</i>

950
01:15:37,195 --> 01:15:41,701
<i>"A cramp in my leg
makes me doubt."</i>

951
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:47,072
<i>"That my mermaid lives in the water
That mountains are not real."</i>

952
01:15:48,074 --> 01:15:52,545
<i>"The cramp goes away,
I stretch and start to think."</i>

953
01:15:53,079 --> 01:15:58,529
<i>'That I can't hug
what I can't touch."</i>

954
01:16:04,491 --> 01:16:08,837
<i>"A dog barks at his owner
and bites his overcoat."</i>

955
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:14,411
<i>"And I get really sad
Even it's not my dog."</i>

956
01:16:15,503 --> 01:16:19,918
<i>"This dog is like my dreams
and I'm the owner."</i>

957
01:16:20,241 --> 01:16:25,351
<i>"Like a dog with no owner
Like the owner of the dream."</i>

958
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:30,692
<i>"I fall asleep thinking of mermaids
and start dreaming."</i>

959
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:36,037
<i>"That it's not convenient to dream
about what I can't touch."</i>

960
01:16:48,472 --> 01:16:51,784
Lu! Make it a little bigger, happier.

961
01:16:52,644 --> 01:16:54,712
- Perfect! Camera?
- Rolling!

962
01:16:54,713 --> 01:16:56,113
- Sound!
- Rolling!

963
01:16:56,114 --> 01:16:58,788
- Mark it!
- Scene 14, take 5!

964
01:17:01,587 --> 01:17:02,998
Action!

965
01:17:18,838 --> 01:17:20,817
Cut! It's a wrap!

966
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:25,116
<i>"In the middle of horrible worlds
I meet her."</i>

967
01:17:25,478 --> 01:17:30,428
<i>"Dancing a furious Mambo
A rhythm arrow."</i>

968
01:17:31,618 --> 01:17:35,761
<i>"She pulls my bow tie,
I put on shoes and a tuxedo."</i>

969
01:17:36,190 --> 01:17:41,265
<i>"I turn into Sinatra...
Into Captain Scarlet."</i>

970
01:17:42,297 --> 01:17:46,575
<i>"I hug her hard
and in silence start to explain."</i>

971
01:17:46,835 --> 01:17:51,808
<i>"That it's not convenient to dream
With what I can't hug."</i>

972
01:18:20,505 --> 01:18:22,484
This is what happened.

973
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,545
We finished the shoot
and went to a cosplay party.

974
01:18:49,870 --> 01:18:55,582
It seemed like the perfect night...
Laughter, beer, dancing, joy...

975
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:58,415
It was great.

976
01:19:15,732 --> 01:19:17,335
Luciana...

977
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:21,080
...was beautiful.

978
01:19:42,193 --> 01:19:44,606
I felt that was the night.

979
01:19:48,066 --> 01:19:51,707
Nico felt it too.
Is it me or this is the night, Nico?

980
01:19:51,903 --> 01:19:55,214
Haven't I told you a thousand times
that you and Luciana are imminent?

981
01:19:55,408 --> 01:19:57,250
Yes, man! Just corner her!

982
01:19:57,510 --> 01:20:02,255
Tell her: "You're under arrest!"
You're the Lone Ranger, steal her heart!

983
01:20:02,348 --> 01:20:04,794
Give her all your love.
Look her in the eyes.

984
01:20:04,951 --> 01:20:07,090
You'll have her falling for you
in a second.

985
01:20:07,286 --> 01:20:09,664
Do you get me?
Give me a hug.

986
01:20:10,357 --> 01:20:12,336
But pay attention to her.

987
01:20:12,659 --> 01:20:15,970
Look at her. Smile at her.
To infinity... and beyond!

988
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:18,611
At one point...

989
01:20:18,832 --> 01:20:23,144
I was dancing...
and I started to feel alone.

990
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,619
There was no one around me.

991
01:20:30,378 --> 01:20:31,823
And...

992
01:20:34,249 --> 01:20:36,230
Suddenly I see Nico arrive...

993
01:20:42,258 --> 01:20:45,795
His face pale.
And I ask him.

994
01:20:48,932 --> 01:20:50,912
How long was the kiss?

995
01:20:54,804 --> 01:20:58,377
<i>"The world ends."</i>

996
01:20:58,876 --> 01:21:03,824
<i>"And I wonder."
"If you..."</i>

997
01:21:11,355 --> 01:21:14,700
<i>"Are aware."</i>

998
01:21:15,225 --> 01:21:20,836
<i>"That I need,
to come back."</i>

999
01:21:27,907 --> 01:21:34,915
<i>"There's no time anymore."
"To argue."</i>

1000
01:21:37,116 --> 01:21:42,998
<i>"No, there's no more time."
"Not even to lie."</i>

1001
01:21:43,656 --> 01:21:45,637
<i>"No more..."</i>

1002
01:21:52,466 --> 01:21:56,176
<i>"If I'm from heaven."</i>

1003
01:21:56,471 --> 01:22:02,217
<i>"And you're from the sea
We'll sure..."</i>

1004
01:22:02,878 --> 01:22:06,415
<i>"We'll explode..."</i>

1005
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:15,891
<i>"We'll be the cause
Of a new Big Bang..."</i>

1006
01:22:16,759 --> 01:22:18,740
<i>"You and I."</i>

1007
01:22:38,648 --> 01:22:42,597
Eight hundred bucks, man!
What the fuck!

1008
01:22:44,255 --> 01:22:48,897
Stop the car, Nico.
C'mon. Stop it.

1009
01:22:49,328 --> 01:22:51,308
Stop the car.

1010
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:54,802
- I want to walk.
- Hey, Juan! Where're you going?

1011
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:33,819
- So...
- Hey!

1012
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:36,823
I know that guy.

1013
01:24:01,973 --> 01:24:03,849
<i>- Hello.
- I know why you're there.</i>

1014
01:24:04,875 --> 01:24:08,085
- You're about to take a decision.
- I don't know.

1015
01:24:09,781 --> 01:24:14,527
Could it be that the night
you proposed... the orgy...

1016
01:24:15,553 --> 01:24:17,157
That was just a game!

1017
01:24:17,288 --> 01:24:20,168
That night,
you didn't get to learn...

1018
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:24,673
You were in front
of a professional baseball player.

1019
01:24:26,899 --> 01:24:29,004
What does that have to do
with anything?

1020
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:31,950
Hold this for a second.

1021
01:24:43,183 --> 01:24:45,254
So you have a bit of magic too.

1022
01:25:37,975 --> 01:25:40,820
NO ONE FORGETS YOU
JUST LIKE THAT

1023
01:25:40,946 --> 01:25:42,016
