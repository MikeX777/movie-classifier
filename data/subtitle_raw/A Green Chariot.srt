00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:57,155
Whats the occasion? -No occasion.

nziun hd nnN pint ‘zdi
Still, you’re here on a Saturday.

62
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:02,561
late at night. Is something wrong?

63
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:08,066
Nothing s wrong, really, it's
just that... Aunt Ina...

64
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,770
sent me a package with some
of Mom s things.

65
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,905
And?
-And in it was...

66
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,941
What was in it?

67
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,817
Oh... Gold.

68
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:27,719
Christians wear crosses

69
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:28,920
Of course Christians.

70
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,156
who else. Moslems?

71
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:32,924
Don't you see. Dad? -What?

72
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,693
I mean... was Mom...

73
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,728
...Christian? Not a chance!

74
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,399
Your mother was a Jew. A Jew

75
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,104
So that's why you came?

76
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,543
How about a simple visit.

77
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,178
doesn't your world value that?

78
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,080
No... It s not just that.

79
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:56,381
Then what else?

80
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,218
I'm getting married. -What s that?

81
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,524
Getting married. -Great. Sasha

82
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,325
Is she Jewish?

83
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,162
She’s from our youth movement.

84
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,763
...I'm just kidding.

85
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,199
Let s see what we have here...

86
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,435
We should celebrate, no?

87
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,237
Don’t worry, it's my friend s car.

88
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,606
It's Kosher.

89
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,782
Cheers. -Cheers.

90
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,925
Yair, it s Dafna.
I'm worried sick about you.

91
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,963
You disappeared, you didn't make it
to my parents, to the activity.

92
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:50,902
I've been trying to reach you all
night... Call me back.

93
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,804
Then whose necklace is it?

94
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,244
Dad. I have to know.

95
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,079
What does it matter?

96
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,515
Did it belong to Mom? -No.

97
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,854
Dad. tell the truth. -What truth?

98
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,689
About the necklace, about Mom.

99
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,290
What do you want to hear?

100
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,225
The real truth.

101
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,227
or your religion's truth?

102
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,095
What does that mean? -Your mothe

103
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,531
was a Jew. A true Jew. you see?

104
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,132
She wore a Star of David, even

105
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,601
at times when it was dangerous.

106
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,237
She insisted you be circumcised.

107
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,771
when that too was dangerous.

108
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,740
Your mother was a true Jew.

109
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:29,374
I don’t understand what you're

110
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:30,842
saying, is the necklace hers?

111
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:33,011
No. -Thank God. Then whose is it?

112
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,081
Her mother s, your grandmother.

113
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,388
Then she wasn't Jewish. If Grandma
wasn't Jewish, neither was she.

114
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,857
Don't you understand?
-I understand.

115
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,893
I understand that you want to let

116
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,096
your religious teachers decide

117
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,297
who your mother was.

118
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:53,665
You should be ashamed of yourself!

119
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,905
Sasha! Yair

120
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,874
Blessed are You. Lord.
King of the world.

121
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:38,143
who gives the rooster wisdom
to know day from night.

122
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,378
Blessed are You. Lord.
King of the^world. who...

123
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,052
didn’t make me a Gentile.

124
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,089
Blessed are You. Lord. King of the
world, who didn't make me a slave.

125
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,458
Blessed are You. Lord. King of the
world, who didn’t make me a woman.

126
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,593
Blessed ar(e You. Lord. King of the
world, who-opens blind eyes.

127
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,963
Blessed ar,e You. Lord. King of the
world, whoclothes the naked.

128
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,331
Blessed* are You...

129
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,662
Where have you been?
-I'm sorry.

130
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,035
I was just... -Do you have any
idea how worried I was about you?

131
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,304
I m really... -You don’t show a
sign of life all day. nothing.

132
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,905
I'm sorry. -'Sorry!

133
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,942
My family waited more than an hour
for you to show up for the meal.

134
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,378
I don't know how many
messages I left for you.

135
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,347
And then you just show up in the
morning saying you're sorry.

136
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,683
You see. I went to see my dad.
-Since when is your dad

137
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,286
in the picture? Couldn't you call',
couldn't you answer your phone-?

138
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:59,157
You re 100 percent right, it's
just that... suddenly...

139
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:05,930
i realized i hadn't told him about 
 us. I felt bad, i had to tel him.

140
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,366
I was so worried about you.
-I'm really sorry.

141
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,437
but still, it s my dad.
He deserves to know about us.

142
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,643
Was he happy to hear it?
-Very. We even drank a toast.

143
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,516
Very nice. Without me.

144
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,519
It's not fair.
I should have been there.

145
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,022
He said that too. He won't approve
until he meets you.

146
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,294
So nothing happened.
-What could have happened?

147
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,296
I don't know,
something doesn't seem right.

148
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,032
The whole story about your dad
has nothing to do-with yesterday.

149
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,034
after all. you didn't drive
to Tel Aviv on the Sabbath.

150
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:51,476
Is it about me? -No...
it has nothing to do with you.

151
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,012
You have nothing to worr.y about.
-But I am worried.

152
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,880
I want to help.
-No. Dafna.

153
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,651
It's something I have to do
on my own.

154
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,857
It will be fine.
It's no big deal.

155
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,860
That's the thing, it is a big
deal. -But I didn't know anything.

156
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,462
I have to resolve this
immediately, today.

157
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,697
Get together whoever you need.
I m here. Let’s do it.

158
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:15,567
Kid. I understand your problem,
but it's not that simple.

159
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,736
First of all. there's a test.
-What 'test? I study at Yeshiva.

160
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:22,774
I go through three pages of Talmud
a day. -Good. It’ll be easy then.

161
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:24,676
I ll take you in to see
Rabbi Struman.

162
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,244
he will set a date
for your test.

163
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,413
and if. God willing,
you pass the test...

164
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:33,651
Hold on. were you circumcised?
-Of course.

165
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,955
A rabbi came especially from
Moscow. -Excellent.

166
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:40,225
So you only have to dip in the
Mikveh. That’s the procedure.

167
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,996
By the way. at which Yeshiva do
you study? - Ohr Yitzhak."

168
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,197
' Ohr Yitzhak,' I know it.

169
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,966
Hold on. it's in Jerusalem, what
are you doing here in Tel Aviv?

170
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,402
What does it matter? I m Jewish.
I keep the commandments...

171
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,974
You keep the commandments...
suggest you re-open the Talmud.

172
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,709

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,683
What? -Come on. I thought
you were a Yeshiva student.

177
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,654
Does Maimonides ring a bell?

00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:13,458
...is punished by death.'
-Excellent. Punished by death.

You are forbidden to keep
the Sabbath for now.

180
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,098
You don’t, have to go overboard.
As-Sabbath comes in.

Why would a Gentile keep Sabbath,

193
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:09,647
Why. is keeping the Sabbath
a hobby?

Sasha, understand, in-the end.

240
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,302
what's important is what-s inside.

241
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,438
You don’t have to be-a-gehius

242
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,941
to see who you really are.

243
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,442

suffering over nothing.

247
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:17,381
For you it s nothing, for me it-s

248
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,617
everything. -Okay, it-s important

249
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,654
to you. -Yes. -Really important-?

250
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,290
Yes. -Then stop pitying yourself*

251
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:28,426
Do what they ask.

252
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,561
They want to test you? Pass it.

lik.o miz,L z,adnuc r,l z,r?ia

254
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,566
It won't cost you anything.

255
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,840
Yair, explain what the Mishna
is. please.

256
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,078
You must have heard of the
Mishna. -I’ve heard of it.

257
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,846
Y:ou must have heard of the
Mishna. -I've heard of it.

258
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,617
d^be glad if you went right
to your-'Jhardest questions.

259
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:53,317
I d be glad if you went right
to your hardest questions.

260
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,819
No need, just answer.
We asked you about the Mishna.

261
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,920
. No heed, jusj answer.
We-asked you about the Mishna.

262
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,456
Is that a 11 ? - T h e n w h a t s the
difference between Biblical-

263
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,392
and Rabbinic >? -Is that it0
—•Pell us^what Mukfze is.

264
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:02,259
and Rabbinic ? -Is that it?
-Tell usVvhat Muktze is.

265
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:04,362
And don't Jorget the Mishna.

266
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,132
The early commentators have three
ways of understanding Muktze.

267
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,400
Maimonides holds that
it is from the Torah.

268
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,101
Maimonides* holds that
it is from the Torah.

269
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,737
Later commentators show he bases
this on the^concept of rebirth.

270
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:15,940
Some early commentators disagree
and say that it s Rabbinic.

271
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,776
and the evidence is in the
Mis'hnaic- tractate -Beitza. ’

272
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,712
Oh. I forgot, you also asked me
what "the JMish na is.

273
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,981
Well. 4he M1 s h n a was written by...
-Okay, we don't need-the details.

274
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:24,949
Well, the Mishna was written by...
-Okay, we don’t need the details.

275
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,584
we just want to see if you know.
-Of course I know.

276
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,551
we just want t'ox see/if you know.
-0f course I know.

277
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:31,122
Yair, you seem very angry.
No one is forcing you to convert.

278
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,257
Are you sure you want to?
-Do I want to...

279
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,092
Are--you .sure you want to9
-Do iVvant t6\.—

He didn't tell me he played.
-He didn't?

00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:53,637
That s how he is. Discreet.

301
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:59,543
You have to.twist his arm.
-Especially lately.

302

It doesn t matter.
That-s what I'm here for.

00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:59,583
That was years ago,N when my mother was still alive

337
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:04,054
Sb what do y.ou have’left.,ijust
theuMikveh-(rituab bath')-?

338
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:08,359
lbs not so simple. -Why. you just
have to dip. In andudut.

339
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:16,633
And what Kapperisi a_ft'er I dip?
Suddenly I m a' Jew-?-Like magic?

340
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,004
being> under water
tor a few seconds-?

341
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,375
That s how it-is. according to. .
-And1 everything I felt, studied...

342
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:33,083
and'prayed’. 'Was; it< all a lie?
Don’t think abdut-it-so much.

343
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,324
Do. y,6u want me to come with yjau
to the Mikveh-?

344
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,896
It's nothing complicated.
You say

345
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,932
"I take upon myself the yoke
of Torah and the commandments.'

346
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,301
you dip. and then you make
the blessing over the Mikveh.

347
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:57,007
You should be happy. You’re
getting a new soul, a Jewish soul.

348
00:27:57,776 --> 00:28:00,044
What about the old one?
-Excuse me?

349
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:04,415
My old soul, the gentile soul, the
one being replaced by a Jewish

350
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,819
one. What happens to it? Does it
come with me? Does it stay here?

351
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,457
Don t you care that a soul is
lost? -Yair... -You take a guy

352
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,326
who gave everything
to become Jewish.

353
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,962
then you suddenly come and
tell him. you’re not Jewish.

354
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,498
Excuse me. mister, that's not the
point. -That's the whole point.

355
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,669
Yair, it's a lot more complex.
It doesn't work like that.

356
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:28,439
You add a dimension to your soul.
-Leave him alone, he's crazy.

357
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,940
That s right. I'm crazy!

358
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,376
Crazy for getting up every
morning to pray and lay Tefillin.

359
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,212
Crazy for never touching my
girlfriend, who I left

360
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:38,916
to study Torah day and night
at Yeshiva. But I'm not Jewish.

361
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,421
I love my soul.

362
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,504
So when does he plan to
try again? -I don’t know.

363
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,139
So when does he plan to
try again? -I don't know.

364
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:04,141
He won t talk about it.

365
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,145
sure he ll* be all right.

366
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:08,745
I'm shure he'll be all right

367
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:09,913
Give him time.

368
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,849
I d rather we d'idn t brjng up
the-subject at all.

369

Hey. look who I brought.

398
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,110
Hi!

399
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:41,918
Our little monster came back.

400
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:44,621
Make your move already.

401
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:06,610
Come on. kid. tell us.

402
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:07,978
How is it with your religious

403
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,613
pals? is life easier now?

404
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,615
No. Not at all. -Ask him

405
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,049
if his religion allows him

406
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,484
to hang out with his friends.

407
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,052
Leave him alone.

408
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,021
Is he allowed to speak Russian

409
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:22,926
Back off. We love you.

410
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:25,829
Pay no attention. It s from love.

411
00:34:27,498 --> 00:34:29,599
Tell him religion has nothing

412
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,568
to do with it. It s just me.

413
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,303
Did you hear that?

414
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:41,111
Stas, pass the silotka.

415
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:47,851
Bon appetit.

416
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:00,897
I missed that taste.

417
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,984
Tolstoy - War and Peace

418
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:27,824
Count Andre was happy, so he

419
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,626
didn’t see Pierre s suffering.

420
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:33,363
Yes. yes. yesterday I suffered.

421
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:35,532
but I don-t regret it.'

422
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,667
(From War and Peace )

423
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:00,423
Hi. Gidi.
-Hi. Dafna. what s up?

424
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,295
There's a problem.
Let me guess: Yair?

425
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,299
He’s not coming.
-I see.

426
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,837
Well. I could use a sunny day.
-Thanks.

427
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:24,548
Sasha, play something. -No. no.

428
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:25,882
Play. play.

429
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,851
I haven’t played in ages.

430
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:29,486
The piano is like a bicycle.

431
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:31,988
you never really forget. Come on.

432
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,492
Sashka.

433
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,963
You're such a...

434
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,367
Remind us of the smell of snow.

435
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:02,852
Hush, the mice are sleeping.

436
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,854
the hedgehogs fell asleep.

437
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:11,695
bear cubs, bear cubs and children.

438
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:20,770
they all sleep until sunrise.

439
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:28,678
All but a green chariot.

440
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:36,920
All but a green chariot.

441
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,725
Rushing, rushing in the heavens.

442
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:45,528
in the silvery expanse.

443
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:50,800
Six horses galloping.

444
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:54,804
in red and green caps

445
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,141
floating over the land.

446
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:00,377
on the windowsill.

447
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,978
a black crow.

448
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:06,816
You can't catch the chariot.

449
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:13,123
for Spring travels within...

450
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,992
I forgot how beautifully you play.

451
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,430
Thanks for taking me there.

452
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:22,532
You re welcome.

453
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,318
Have you ever been with a girl?

454
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,055
No.

455
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:09,345
Are you okay? -I’m a Gentile.

456
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,583
Gentiles are allowed.

457
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:19,389
I wasn't asking about that.

458
00:39:25,496 --> 00:39:27,030
What's wrong

459
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,799
I don't want you to hate me

460
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:35,238
if we sleep together

461
00:39:35,372 --> 00:39:36,606
you'll never forgive me.

462
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:47,217
Sasha, sometimes you have to

463
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:48,985
go away in order to return.

464
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:57,460
Return? To what? -To yourself.

465
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,810
Thanks. Yulia.

466
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,090
Hello. Dalna?

467
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,894
I hoped it would be you.
-Yes. it's me. it's met

468
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,968
The old me or the new me?

469
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,238
Both.

470
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:20,009
I'm comming to you

471
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,460
Hello. Dad?
I'm fine. -

472
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:40,730
Stop worrying about me
all the time-.

473
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,202
But... I have a strange
favor to ask.

474
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,639
We are all just...

475
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:22,872
That s how you say I love you'
in Russian.

476
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:29,212
I love you. -I love you.

477
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:32,982
There should have been a hug here.

478
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:38,054
It will be all right soon

479
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,458
Sooner than you think.

480
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,533
What are they doing here?

481
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,339
what is this?

482
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,376
A house full of girls, everything
we have is pink. -What?

483
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,079
They came especially for you.

484
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,115
Go and dip.

485
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:10,520
Come back to us new.
New and old.

486
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:16,559
Go. Sasha. Go. our Yair.- -
