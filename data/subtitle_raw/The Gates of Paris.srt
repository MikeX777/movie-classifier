00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,640
THE GATES OF PARIS

2
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,190
<i>When there is no wine
in my cask,</i>

3
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,592
<i>when there is no wine
in my cask,</i>

4
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,275
<i>I'm not afraid to
drink water, no.</i>

5
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,836
<i>There are the little flowers.
There are the little flowers.</i>

6
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,470
<i>There are friends.</i>

7
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,397
<i>Goodbye, my heart,
Goodbye, my heart,</i>

8
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,836
<i>I am famous in my neighborhood</i>

9
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,994
<i>I am famous in my neighborhood

10
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,551
<i>I am famous in my neighborhood,
for my defamed heart.</i>

11
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,392
<i>There are the little flowers.
There are the little flowers.</i>

12
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,155
<i>There are friends.</i>

13
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,440
<i>Goodbye, my heart,
Goodbye, my heart,</i>

14
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,471
<i>I come to City Hall,</i>

15
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,430
<i>I come to City Hall,</i>

16
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,873
<i>whenever I marry.</i>

17
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,357
<i>There are the little flowers.
There are the little flowers.</i>

18
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,229
<i>There are friends.</i>

19
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,793
<i>Goodbye, my heart,
Goodbye, my heart,</i>

20
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,317
- It's beautiful.
- But sad.

21
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,634
- That's life!
- Don't start. Go to bed!

22
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,214
- If you talk to me like a dog...
- What?

23
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,833
I won't come back!

24
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,496
- You already said that.
- When?

25
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,352
- Yesterday.
- You'll see.

26
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,832
- When will I see?
- Tomorrow!

27
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,877
OK, then. Until tomorrow.

28
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,236
Take that, for tonight.

29
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,550
Learn to drink for free.

30
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,268
- Did you hear him?
- They're pigs!

31
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,238
They're pigs, alright.

32
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,752
Except you...and I.

33
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,039
And me, absolutely not.

34
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,715
- The bread is dry.
- Soak it.

35
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,236
- There's not much.
- We'll split it.

36
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,238
When I'm rich, you will
never eat dry bread.

37
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,193
You'll have whatever you want.

38
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,315
Whatever you want! What is
the best thing you've eaten?

39
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,956
Foie gras.

40
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,157
- Foie gras?
- Do you know what it is?

41
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,436
I don't remember.

42
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,236
If you had tried it,
you'd agree.

43
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,599
Artist, you're a good friend.

44
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,757
Listen, when I'm rich...

45
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,879
- You'll serve foie gras.
- All you want.

46
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,391
I'm no good!

47
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,280
Worthless! They all say it.

48
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,431
And they're right.

49
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,960
- Take my glass.
- Never!

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,831
I won't!

51
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,519
I don't want any more.

52
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,397
- You hardly drank any.
- You're thirstier than I am.

53
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,317
- We'll share it?
- It's all yours.

54
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,392
Really?

55
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,374
- I'm a pig.
- Like everyone.

56
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,519
More than anyone!
I don't know why I'm on this earth!

57
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,238
Doesn't matter.

58
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,995
- I want to hang myself.
- You've already said that.

59
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,310
- When?
- Yesterday.

60
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,036
- Goodbye, Artist.
- Goodbye, Juju.

61
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,996
- Tomorrow I hang myself.
- Yeah. See you tomorrow.

62
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,951
Mama!

63
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,756
Mama?

64
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,312
"Mama, Mama!"
She just left.

65
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,429
- She didn't wait for me?
- If she waits for you, she doesn't work.

66
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,239
Mom! Juju wants to go with you!

67
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,473
I don't need that useless bum.

68
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,838
Did you hear that?

69
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,276
Poor mama! Working at your age!

70
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,915
It's incredible!

71
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,000
What's incredible is having
a brother like you!

72
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,549
And a sister that finished
all the coffee.

73
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,915
If you want some, go to the bar!

74
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,914
You see? You're forcing me to go.

75
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,398
Okay, I'm going.

76
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,195
Hey, Juju!

77
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,016
- Hey, Juju.
- Hi, Maria.

78
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,679
- Everything ok?
- No.

79
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,834
- Why?
- It's habit.

80
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,519
- You could help.
- Yes. I never think.

81
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,851
But you think about yourself.

82
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,398
That's not funny. Do you know of
anyone that thinks of other people?

83
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,351
- Not many.
- I know one.

84
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,274
- Who?
- Someone who's not selfish: the Artist.

85
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,877
Yesterday I had nothing to drink
and he gave me his glass.

86
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,798
I'll give him a reward.

87
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,873
He's a friend, the Artist.

88
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,354
- What's happening?
- Police!

89
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,275
- It's dangerous. Get inside!
- This isn't my shop!

90
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:51,759
It doesn't matter.

91
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,678
- Where are you going?
- My house.

92
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,717
- Where?
- There.

93
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,750
Do you like foie gras?
Today it's free.

94
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,951
I'll return the bag.

95
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,238
Don't eat it all, I'll be back.

96
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,229
And they say I don't think
of others!

97
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,878
- Where are you going?
- To return the bag to Maria!

98
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,909
She's the girl from the bar. Alphonse!
I have your daughter's bag!

99
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,355
Stop clowning around and
get on with it.

100
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,089
- What about Maria?
- Look at the police! What are they after?

101
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,879
- Someone's committed a robbery.
- They say it's dangerous.

102
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,079
Perhaps he's hiding in here?
Here, the potatoes!

103
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,956
They're checking all the houses!

104
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,539
- What houses?
- All of them.

105
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,036
- They have no right.
- They don't care.

106
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,830
- They're searching houses!
- Who?

107
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,912
- The police! Looking for someone...
- So what?

108
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,569
- They'll come!
- So what?

109
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,791
Don't you understand?
I didn't pay for the tins!

110
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,550
They're moving closer.
Soon they'll be here.

111
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,514
- Let's hide the cans.
- And if they find them?

112
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,478
- I'll say they're mine.
- And if they ask where you got them?

113
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,589
- Maybe you're right...
- We must throw them away.

114
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,156
- What if they find them?
- They won't find them here.

115
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,436
- What about prints?
- What prints?

116
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,156
- Fingers!
- My God!

117
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,479
One...

118
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,719
Two...

119
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,713
Three...

120
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,479
And ten!

121
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,676
- And we are calm.
- They can come now.

122
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,394
- How about this?
- Do you think that...?

123
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,155
- If the shopkeeper said anything...
- Look out, they're coming.

124
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,355
- What do we do?
- Don't worry.

125
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,315
- They're here.
- Act naturally.

126
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,710
- As if we weren't waiting for them.
- Sit!

127
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,394
Look like you're busy.

128
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,471
<i>Through his mouth,
the most gluttonous in the world,</i>

129
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,316
<i>he slid almonds.
Being a thief, what a great profession!</i>

130
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,469
<i>Answers a squirrel
from a hole</i>

131
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,076
<i>Answers a squirrel
from his hole</i>

132
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,869
<i>saying "I'm greedy
and I have a fine nose,</i>

133
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,076
<i>just like an almond..."</i>

134
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,191
- What's down here?
- Nothing.

135
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,511
- What's it for?
- It's the cellar.

136
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,116
<i>He sees the nicest almond
tree in the neighborhood,</i>

137
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,590
<i>He sees the nicest almond
tree in the neighborhood,</i>

138
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,435
<i>And his greedy mouth
defies the world!</i>

139
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,310
<i>He slid almonds.
Being a thief, what a great profession!</i>

140
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,795
You think that's funny?

141
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,791
Look in the corner!

142
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,957
He can't be here.

143
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,198
Okay. Come up.

144
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,875
It won't be so funny when
we find them!

145
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,280
- Let's go get the foie gras.
- Are you sure?

146
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,716
They won't be back, they already looked
everywhere. They'll find it out there.

147
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,233
Come on!

148
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,355
- If they found them...
- They would have eaten them.

149
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,795
I knew something bad would happen.

150
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,830
- Nine...
- And ten.

151
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,275
- I got them all.
- Come on.

152
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,828
We have not done badly,
Artist.

153
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,479
You're right.

154
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,599
We'll eat until we burst!

155
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,916
Say anything and I'll kill you.
Shut the door! You hear me?

156
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,774
- Don't move!
- Put down the gun.

157
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,910
- Shut up or I'll shoot!
- You're the one making all the noise.

158
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,833
- Enough. Is there another way out?
- No.

159
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,831
If they come back...

160
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,992
- We haven't done anything to you.
- I don't care!

161
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,830
Will you permit me?
If they return, there's a cellar.

162
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,352
And when I'm inside
you'll call them!

163
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,033
No, no!

164
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,756
Around here, guys!

165
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,708
- Is this a basement?
- Yes. Very small.

166
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,359
Open it!

167
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,797
- The dog has brought us here!
- We've already checked it!

168
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,235
- But the dog...
- What does the dog know?

169
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,436
- There's a basement...
- I've looked. Come on!

170
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,915
- Now that was close.
- It wouldn't have hurt to say something...

171
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,072
- But we didn't.
- No, we fell into it.

172
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,754
- Ms. Cabatier, your son!
- My son is a bum!

173
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,749
Juju, are you working today?

174
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,469
- I can't. I'm busy.
- I thought so.

175
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,798
Hi, Mom.

176
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,472
- Hi, Mom.
- Don't touch anything!

177
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,269
Are the clothes for sale or not?
I come as a customer.

178
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,351
Customers like you...

179
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,792
- You'll give me a good price?
- I know your price.

180
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,191
- It's for a friend...
- I know your friends.

181
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,430
This one you don't.

182
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,193
- Do not touch anything!
- I'm not a thief. I'll pay you.

183
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,753
With what?

184
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,719
Now here's a surprise:
With money!

185
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,313
- How much longer?
- Wait until dark.

186
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,597
- Sure you're not just talking?
- I haven't had a drink today.

187
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,997
When I think about being
stuck with rednecks like you...

188
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,918
- You can't always choose.
- If I'm wrong, too bad for me.

189
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,032
- I'm shattered.
- How long have they been after you?

190
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,078
Since yesterday morning. Enough!

191
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,834
Go ask the police.

192
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,072
- I could have done that before.
- Why haven't you?

193
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,710
- Because you're in my house.
- So what?

194
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,512
It's a rule of the house
not to turn anyone in.

195
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,079
- Juju, come have something!
- I have no time!

196
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,310
- I'm buying!
- Another day!

197
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,472
Juju, come join us!

198
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,471
Leave me alone!

199
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,954
Crazy, you left
the curtain open!

200
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,792
Change of clothes.

201
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,520
With this he'll be able to escape.

202
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,540
- That's all I want!
- Why are they after him?

203
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,118
We'll see in the newspapers.

204
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,033
- Did he say anything?
- Not much. He's sleeping.

205
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,792
I'm going to wake him.

206
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,148
What's his name?

207
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,390
I don't know. He doesn't talk much.

208
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,279
My friend! Here are your clothes!

209
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,036
- What?
- You can go now, there's no one around.

210
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,710
You can disguise yourself.

211
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,793
I was dreaming! Let me
sleep for an hour!

212
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,797
Only an hour!

213
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,589
Come on, let him sleep.

214
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,916
- They're my friends.
- Get rid of them!

215
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,071
They'll call the police.

216
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,438
Quiet! I'm coming!

217
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,670
Say goodbye for me.

218
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,553
Get out of here!

219
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,875
There's playing for you!

220
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,229
- They were using a machine gun!
- We were just talking about that.

221
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,356
Can we continue?

222
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,435
<i>Pierre Barbier
was known to police.

223
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,832
<i>Until now, he was not considered
a very dangerous individual.

224
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,989
<i>Barbier, attractive and elegant,
related to

225
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,789
<i>certain environments of
Montmartre and Marseille...

226
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,909
<i>He has now become
public enemy number one.

227
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,948
<i>The police prepared
a trap in a hotel

228
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,351
<i>where Barbier intended to meet

229
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,910
<i>with one of his victims.

230
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,790
<i>But Barbier escaped 
and proceeded to steal a car.

231
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,715
<i>At the wheel of the car
he crossed through the village.

232
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,031
<i>None were able to prevent 
his escape.

233
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,718
<i>The police gave the alarm
and went in search of Barbier.

234
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,396
<i>They continued to track the car,
which they located in a traffic jam.

235
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,993
<i>Then, Barbier took his
machine gun and fired.

236
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,038
<i>Two officers were shot,
dying in the line of duty.

237
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,839
<i>In the confusion of the shooting,

238
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,072
<i>three pedestrians were left injured

239
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,958
<i>and the killer disappeared.

240
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,112
<i>He then drove all night,
trying to get to Paris.

241
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,353
<i>At dawn he had an accident

242
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,034
<i>near the Porte des Lilas.

243
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,354
<i>Witnesses saw a wounded man 
get out of the car.</i>

244
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,433
<i>The area was surrounded</i>

245
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,717
<i>and police checked all houses
of the vicinity in vain.</i>

246
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,591
<i>Despite the tracking dogs, 
the bandit remains at large.</i>

247
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,233
<i>30 years old, blue eyes, mustache.
</i>

248
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,118
<i>He wears a checkered suit.</i>

249
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,430
He won't get far.
And when they catch him...

250
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,070
Three people, two agents...

251
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,869
- Without a doubt!
- This newspaper's a joke.

252
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,271
If he had come here,
he wouldn't have escaped.

253
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,149
- I think he's gone.
- With so many police around?

254
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,914
- And those clothes?
- It would attract attention.

255
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,710
- Maybe he waited for night...
- And where do you suppose he waited?

256
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,958
Just saying. I don't know anything.

257
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,669
Except how to steal my newspaper!

258
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,356
- I'll return it tomorrow!
- Go away, thief!

259
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,115
Little Barbier!

260
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,474
What are you doing here?

261
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,074
- Playing Barbier. You know him?
- No.

262
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,789
The one that was here yesterday.
How long has he been gone?

263
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,758
He's still here.

264
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,038
- No way.
- He's sick...and uncomfortable.

265
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,599
- I'm not surprised.
- He's angry.

266
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,349
When he's angry, he's dangerous...

267
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,956
Look who's in here. Barbier!

268
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,635
- Do you see the risk we run?
- Collusion, cover-up...

269
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,678
He has to leave here healthy!

270
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,190
Any problems?

271
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,113
Did you hear me?

272
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,798
You should take the air outside...
it's not good being locked up!

273
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,157
Set aside the gun!
It's me, Juju!

274
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,199
- Don't you feel well?
- Let me die.

275
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,954
- What?
- He wants to die.

276
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,674
If he dies, what will we do?

277
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,868
It's true...if you die,
we'll be in a mess.

278
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,958
You can't do that.
We have to treat you.

279
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,236
But what's wrong, exactly?

280
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,357
- I feel bad.
- I know. But what's wrong?

281
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,910
- I can't see well.
- You're in a basement!

282
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:46,470
I'm suffocating...my heart beats
fast and then stops.

283
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,269
And I hear noises, as if
I'm being pursued by an army.

284
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,790
Barbier! It's Barbier!

285
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,873
- Am I going crazy?
- Don't mind them. They're children!

286
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,352
- How do they know I'm here?
- They don't. They're just playing.

287
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,796
- Why are they calling my name?
- They're playing at being Barbier!

288
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,317
What? Go kill them!
Shoot! They're police!

289
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,110
Enough, or I'll throw you out!

290
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,635
- Do you understand?
- He's Barbier!

291
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,951
- No! I'm him!
- No, not you! Me!

292
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,997
- I don't want to be a cop!
- Am I not, Barbier?

293
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,355
- No!
- Well, take that!

294
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,440
Just take what I told you to.
And stay in bed.

295
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,912
If there's no improvement, 
tell your doctor.

296
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,599
The doctor, the doctor...
I won't be talking to anyone but you.

297
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,672
Look, it's like
I'm suffocating...

298
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,912
My heart beats fast
and then stops.

299
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,153
- No, it does not stop.
- Yes, I told you it does...

300
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,156
Maybe it's nerves, but
suffocating is another matter.

301
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,472
- What happened? Are you sick?
- No, but he must stay in bed.

302
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,758
- It's not that serious.
- This morning you weren't sick.

303
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,833
- I just caught it.
- Look at me. Don't pout.

304
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,991
It's nothing.

305
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,434
Come on, one, two, three!

306
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,911
How will I get it back up here?

307
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,358
We'll see. Look, on the
mattress you'll feel better.

308
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,355
We are not savages.
With a good bed you'll improve.

309
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,512
What's wrong?

310
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,513
Come on upstairs.

311
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,993
- It's the cat.
- It was looking at me!

312
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,871
- Are you afraid of the cat?
- It's bad luck.

313
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:01,114
- For the rats, not for you.
- It's a cop! Throw it out!

314
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,989
Don't get angry! I'll get rid of him.
You won't see him again.

315
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,030
- What?
- He doesn't like cats.

316
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,352
- It happens.
- He has a fever. Put yourself in his place.

317
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,118
Keep playing. He says that music
helps him sleep.

318
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,669
It's as if you're rocking him.

319
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,469
Shaven face is best.
Tomorrow you'll run like a rabbit!

320
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,468
- To your health!
- It's no time to drink.

321
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,796
Come now, don't get angry.

322
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,111
- You keep a lookout. I'll follow you.
- I'll keep my eyes open.

323
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,793
Do you remember everything?

324
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,475
I phone her and say "Libel".

325
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,713
- I'm the only one who calls her that.
- If she pretends not to understand?

326
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,238
- There's danger. If you answer...
- All clear. "Libel"...

327
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,954
Don't look so nervous, you'll
attract attention!

328
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,554
- Don't be afraid.
- Come on.

329
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,279
- Act naturally.
- As if we're just walking.

330
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,995
She looked at us strangely.

331
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,915
So what? Do we call or not?

332
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,949
Go ask your friend!

333
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,751
Tomorrow he'll be gone.
He'll be with her again...

334
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,514
with his love.

335
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,077
Hello...Libel...

336
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,309
I am a friend of
Libel, the flame...

337
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,471
Can we talk?

338
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,398
Yes. On the fifth floor?

339
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,472
Yes, right now.

340
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,917
- Do we have to go?
- She said right now.

341
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,510
This is love.

342
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,309
Wait. They might have followed us.

343
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,675
Let's not lose any more time.

344
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,830
Where are you going?

345
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,436
- Up to the fifth.
- To see whom?

346
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,553
- A lady.
- What's her name?

347
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,830
- I don't know...
- You don't know?

348
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,798
- I must have the wrong house.
- I'm not surprised.

349
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,679
Here we are not beggars!

350
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,355
And if you insist, I'll call
the policeman at the corner!

351
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,760
I come on behalf of Pierrot.

352
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,956
Are you sure that you haven't been followed?

353
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,473
All clear.

354
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,350
Here's his things.
They're all ready to go.

355
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,035
But you don't know.
I have a surprise for you.

356
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,589
Tomorrow he'll be here...

357
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,593
You'll have him all to yourself.

358
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,550
Are you crazy? Here?
With the noise he's made?

359
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,872
Take this, and don't stay out here.

360
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,031
What do I say to Pierrot?

361
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,431
I'm going on a trip...
but I'll be thinking of him.

362
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,036
With things as they are,
Artist, we're lucky.

363
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,273
- If the cop had seen us...
- We're still in luck. Look.

364
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,637
No worries. We have a vehicle.

365
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,237
Nobody.
And here it's shorter.

366
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,871
We're a bit stupid.
We could go to jail.

367
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,792
- We must do it.
- For Barbier!

368
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,997
We're doing him a favor.
You go first.

369
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,274
Who are we going to this much
trouble for? A murderer!

370
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,000
- You sound like the police.
- I'm not in favor of the police.

371
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,035
Nor the murderer's.

372
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,475
- Whose then?
- Mine.

373
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,756
- You alone?
- Me alone.

374
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:50,550
You're so selfish. Don't you
think of others? What about me?

375
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,792
You? You're not my friend.

376
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,794
- No? Since when?
- Since he arrived.

377
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,675
- You admire him.
- I admire, I admire...

378
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,010
I wouldn't want anything
bad to happen to him.

379
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,713
Come on.

380
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,429
Nothing bad? What about the others?
Hasn't he done bad to them?

381
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,238
He didn't know them!

382
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,470
And people like him remain
in this world.

383
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,949
I don't want to discuss this.

384
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,156
Don't argue and come on.

385
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,395
- Easy!
- Easy! Don't make me laugh!

386
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,197
- Hold on!
- I'm doing what I can.

387
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,148
- And now what?
- What about me? Just think of yourself!

388
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,393
- Artist! Where are you?
- I'm here!

389
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,356
Have you broken anything?

390
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,472
Pass the bags!

391
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:05,269
Just think of the luggage!
What about me?

392
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,238
- I won't argue with you.
- Take them yourself.

393
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,079
I don't know whose luggage
this is!

394
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,438
The cops!

395
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,559
Damn! Damn!
You can't trust women!

396
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,235
- You're right. You can't.
- I can't go to a hotel!

397
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,278
- You wouldn't last long.
- Where does she expect me to go?

398
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,077
- I think she doesn't care.
- You think so?

399
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,276
It's not going to work like that.
I'm going home to sort this out!

400
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,352
Tomorrow...we'll go tomorrow.

401
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,598
- Well, I'll go!
- Calm down.

402
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,751
You'll get sick again.

403
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,634
- What happened?
- It's nothing.

404
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,519
Think I can't hear?

405
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,797
- Are the fireworks in your house?
- No, I haven't heard anything!

406
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,636
Everyone is against me.

407
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,358
I'm all alone.

408
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,839
I'd be better off if they shot
me and finished me off.

409
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,230
Don't say that, you're not alone.

410
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,315
We're here. We won't let that happen.
eh, Artist?

411
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,120
I can't compromise you both.

412
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,919
You're not jeopardizing the Artist!

413
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,191
We can't abandon a friend.

414
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,229
Now I know, you are a
friend. Right, Artist?

415
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,631
Sure. A real friend.

416
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,990
I don't know where they came from.
I didn't notice.

417
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,390
- Three shots.
- Maybe.

418
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,632
- You don't know anything?
- I know as much as you.

419
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,468
- Did you hear the shots?
- I heard nothing.

420
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,598
- They came from where the artist lives.
- I was at the Artist's place.

421
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,034
- When?
- When they were fired.

422
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,191
But you didn't hear them...

423
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,791
They say that Barbier
has crossed into Spain.

424
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,919
The newspapers lie.
Who are you talking about?

425
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,718
Of Barbier!

426
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,038
- Who's he?
- Juju, we've talked about him!

427
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,033
- People talk too much.
- Where are you going?

428
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,952
To work.

429
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,799
- Increible. You come to buy?
- I'm a customer.

430
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,030
- What were you looking for?
- Too expensive.

431
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,758
I didn't say anything.

432
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,314
Have you got anything not so loud?
It's for a sick person.

433
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,639
- Hey, it's too hot!
- I don't want you to catch cold.

434
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,392
Throw me some ice!

435
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,152
Coming up!

436
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,875
I have your stuff.
Whisky...

437
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,952
- What brand?
- I can't read this.

438
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,829
- Let's see.
- I hope it's what you wanted.

439
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,156
- Yes, next.
- English cigarettes...

440
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,639
With cork filter?

441
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,836
- Yes, cork.
- Next.

442
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,991
And last.

443
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,077
This is all I have left.

444
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,391
- It won't get you very far.
- But I have to go.

445
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,870
- How will you make it?
- Relax, pour the water.

446
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,871
Yes, Colonel.

447
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,917
- I've never had one of these.
- Choose one.

448
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,389
- I don't want to leave you without...
- Choose one.

449
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,870
Thank you, Pierrot.
I can call you Pierrot, right?

450
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,191
- Sure, I'll call you Juju.
- This?

451
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,956
A girl gave it to me.

452
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:51,478
- Libel?
- Not her. Another one.

453
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,349
I call them all that.

454
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,469
- The tobacco smells very strange...
- It's English.

455
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,831
And the cork filters?

456
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,279
- So they don't stick to the lips.
- You think of everything.

457
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,030
Are you always dressed like that?

458
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,033
I can't afford
clothes like yours.

459
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,668
Let's eat! Come on up!

460
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,029
This I can't give you.
Nobody would believe it's yours.

461
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,878
Doesn't it bother you?

462
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,115
This is it's home.

463
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,397
Don't get angry, soon
it'll recover it's place.

464
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,757
- Think you'll be going soon?
- If you help me.

465
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,435
- That's all I want.
- Look how brave, the Artist.

466
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,200
He'd do anything to get rid of me.

467
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,029
- What do you want?
- A passport...

468
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,192
...for going overseas.
Will it take long to get one?

469
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,351
- It depends.
- More or less?

470
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,875
- Ten to fifteen days.
- Ten to fifteen days!

471
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,072
Hey, your hat!

472
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,636
What do I need?

473
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,789
You must bring me the
necessary documents.

474
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,911
Identity card...

475
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,798
Military papers...

476
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,037
and two photos.

477
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,155
When you have the passport,
I'll stick my photo onto it.

478
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,117
I'm good with false documents.

479
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,510
And with a passport, 
you can go anywhere.

480
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,993
- I'll go to South America.
- Won't you get bored?

481
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,357
Less than here. For now,
for me, France is a basement!

482
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,753
I don't want to spend my life in a
basement! I like the sun!

483
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,238
Juju! Come see this.

484
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,553
- Who is it?
- A girl.

485
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,871
- What's she doing here?
- Don't move, I'll see.

486
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,873
- I know her. It's Maria.
- What Maria?

487
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,634
- The girl at the bar.
- Why's she here?

488
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,190
She's a friend. Likes
the Artist's music.

489
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,952
Careful, she's coming back.

490
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,113
- I don't want her near the house.
- I'll get rid of her.

491
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,316
- Be careful what you say!
- What do you take me for?

492
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,712
Don't trust her. Women
can find out everything.

493
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,750
- Hey, Maria!
- How are you, Juju?

494
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,677
- What are you doing here?
- I hoped that I could come in.

495
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,788
- I must have been sleeping.
- You weren't sleeping, you were talking.

496
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,238
- I wasn't talking!
- Well then, who was?

497
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,156
- The Artist.
- He's at home?

498
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,632
- If you heard talking, he must be.
- Is he coming to the dance tonight?

499
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,356
- I don't know.
- Ask him.

500
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,990
Artist, will you be going
to the dance tonight?

501
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:53,235
- He says yes.
- If you say yes, then yes.

502
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,038
Goodbye, Maria.

503
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,838
Goodbye, Juju.

504
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,671
- Goodbye, Maria.
- Say hello to the Artist for me.

505
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,677
Artist, Maria says hello.

506
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,229
Good morning, Artist.

507
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,039
Hey, Artist! Say hello to Juju!

508
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,195
- Is everything OK?
- I'm fine.

509
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,353
You've only drunk half.
Last time, you emptied it all at once.

510
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,473
- When?
- Before, the last time you drank.

511
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,876
You got me worried.

512
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,117
- Juju, are you feeling better?
- What's wrong with you? I'm not sick.

513
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,478
This afternoon you made a bad face,
and it doesn't seem any better.

514
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:12,279
But you're looking beautiful.
For whom?

515
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:14,078
For you!

516
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,754
When I am rich, we'll go to the Midi.

517
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,480
Okay. What a handkerchief!

518
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,110
- It's silk.
- But you're not wearing it right.

519
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,750
Is it a gift? From a girl?

520
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,799
- Who would want to give me anything?
- Your cigarette smells very strange.

521
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,435
- It's English with cork filter.
- Why cork?

522
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,560
To avoid soiling the lips.

523
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,555
Juju, you're very nice!
You make me laugh. Goodbye.

524
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,315
- Don't stay out too late.
- Watch the lips, Juju.

525
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,993
Is she laughing at me?

526
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,789
Maria, did you laugh at me?

527
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,474
Maria...I wanted to tell you something.

528
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,399
Tell me.

529
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,028
Before, what you heard,

530
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,909
it wasn't the Artist, you know?

531
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,035
It was me. I was speaking.

532
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,193
- Why tell me?
- Well, you might have thought

533
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,349
- I was talking to someone...
- You're within your rights.

534
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,876
Yes, but there was nobody else.

535
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,993
- Then, you were talking to yourself.
- Just to myself.

536
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,191
- Are you coming to the dance, Juju?
- I only dance on July 14th.

537
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,589
- Will you come to the dance?
- If you want...

538
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,912
I'm not like you, Juju.
I don't like talking to myself.

539
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,950
- All right, Juju!
- You are the king!

540
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,475
- How well you dance!
- Shut your mouth!

541
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,837
- Don't talk like that when you dance!
- But they're laughing at me.

542
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,392
Let them say whatever they want!
You are the cutest! You are the king!

543
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:35,114
You also laugh at me.
You can't trust women.

544
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,957
What are you saying?

545
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,355
- They are all whores.
- Enough is enough! Goodbye!

546
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,397
He's king!

547
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,792
- He's the strongest!
- If you're not dancing, then sit down!

548
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,952
Where are you going?

549
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,151
What are you doing there?
You'll catch cold.

550
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,151
My head is spinning.

551
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,632
- What, all of a sudden?
- All of a sudden. Sit.

552
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:33,072
A beautiful night,
don't you think?

553
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,070
Maria,

554
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,395
if I told you something you can't 
tell anyone...a secret...

555
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:49,194
- Can you keep it a secret?
- Yes!

556
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:55,952
- Me too.
- Then keep it!

557
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,591
- I have nothing more to say.
- Then shut up.

558
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,791
- What's that?
- He forgot to turn off the radio.

559
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,873
Does the Artist have a radio?
Since when?

560
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,279
- Since I bought it.
- What if we turned it off?

561
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,277
- I don't know how.
- I do.

562
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,040
We always lock the door.

563
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,599
And when you want to enter
and it's locked, what do you do?

564
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,757
You use the key.

565
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,149
- How did you know?
- I have good eyesight.

566
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,950
- You must learn to close your eyes.
- And my ears.

567
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,598
Give it to me.

568
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,159
Are you serious about going 
to Midi when you're rich?

569
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,671
You never know...

570
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,038
- Am I invited?
- Still a long way off.

571
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,510
Here, finish it.

572
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,673
You seem to know what I'm thinking.

573
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,713
Maria...

574
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,430
...whatever it is you know,
could you not tell anyone?

575
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,516
You haven't said anything.
I have nothing to repeat.

576
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:50,388
If I tell you something, can you
swear not to tell?

577
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,757
I have no secrets from you.

578
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,637
Good night, Juju.

579
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,838
Wait.

580
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,677
- You'll never tell?
- No, Juju.

581
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,149
- Not anyone?
- I've sworn.

582
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,437
If something happened,
you know what's waiting for him?

583
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:26,037
- I know.
- I couldn't live with myself. I would die.

584
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,955
You are very good, Juju.

585
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,150
Your hair smells good.
If I ever get rich...

586
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,311
Take me to the Midi.

587
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,037
Enough, go inside.

588
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:46,228
- Goodbye. You can sleep peacefully.
- I'm not so sure.

589
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,554
- Not so loud!
- What?

590
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,793
The radio, not so loud!
You're getting reckless.

591
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,988
- We can't hear anyone.
- But I can hear the music through the walls.

592
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,515
You're right. Let's be wise.

593
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,430
- There are some guys out there!
- What guys?

594
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,113
Look!

595
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,473
- My God!
- Do you know them?

596
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,790
- No.
- They look like cops.

597
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,034
- Relax, nothing will happen.
- Have you spoken to anyone?

598
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,874
Pierrot, if they came for you,
I'd shoot them.

599
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,600
And the Artist? Where's he?
What's he doing?

600
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,271
Artist, they're asking for you.

601
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,670
- Who?
- Two gentlemen.

602
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,435
- What gentlemen?
- Having trouble with the cops?

603
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,955
They're headed over to your house.

604
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,879
Where are you going? Don't interfere.

605
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,114
- Who's he?
- A friend.

606
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,437
- Does he live here?
- No.

607
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,875
- Do you live alone?
- I'm not married.

608
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,634
- What are you doing here?
- He came to see me.

609
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,031
As did we...we're here to see you.

610
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,953
- You know what about?
- No idea.

611
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,112
- How about you?
- I don't know anything.

612
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,118
Do you have a clear conscience?
Do you know what we want here?

613
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,957
I don't know.

614
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:01,159
Make a little effort...
Last week...

615
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,436
You don't have anything for us?
No? Maybe we can help you.

616
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:11,636
- Does this say anything to you? What is it?
- A can.

617
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,234
- Okay. Full or empty?
- Empty.

618
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,709
Outside we found six more.

619
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,997
Eleven of them disappeared from the shop.
Where are the others?

620
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,756
If this is what you came for,
you might have said so.

621
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:33,313
There was no need for all this.
I can show you the others.

622
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:41,871
- And on top of that, they laugh!
- There are five cans. You're welcome!

623
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,755
I took them myself.
You have some complaint?

624
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:51,153
The shopkeeper isn't bothered.
Don't you think, Artist?

625
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,230
Artist, what's wrong?
He's stunned.

626
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:57,197
Not the time to sit down.
We're going to the police station!

627
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,239
Sure! Come to the station!

628
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:04,119
These gentlemen don't have
time to waste.

629
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,315
- The cops have wrecked everything!
- Did they check the basement?

630
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,993
Is there a basement?

631
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,396
There's a mattress. Do you think
the Artist sleeps here?

632
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:02,919
- What are you doing here? Out!
- Nothing bad, we're singing!

633
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,836
Do I have to fetch your father?
Get out!

634
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,079
Don't move.

635
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,279
Don't play with that.
It's not for women.

636
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,879
Careful, it might go off.
Put it down.

637
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,794
- Isn't your name Maria?
- How do you know?

638
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,270
I know. And you know my name?

639
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,432
- No.
- I don't like liars.

640
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,239
- What's my name?
- I don't know.

641
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,714
- Look into my eyes.
- You're hurting me!

642
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,030
Say my name!
Come on, be brave!

643
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,670
- Pierre Ba...
- Enough.

644
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,640
I see that I'm famous in 
this neighborhood.

645
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:12,994
- Did the artist tell you?
- No.

646
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,833
- Who?
- The artist didn't say anything.

647
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,119
I get it...you can't trust anyone.

648
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,751
- I won't say anything.
- If I make you silent I can be sure.

649
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,718
Just have to push...
you wouldn't make noise...

650
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:31,197
But you're lucky.

651
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,509
You're lucky to be so beautiful.

652
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,675
The newspapers would laugh if
they knew I couldn't kill you!

653
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:44,356
Go tell the police!
Get out!

654
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,873
Hey!

655
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,353
Are you daydreaming?

656
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,073
They're coming!

657
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,549
- Are they?
- They let them go?

658
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,389
Artist, what did you do?

659
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,870
- He hasn't done anything.
- Tell us about it!

660
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:40,792
I have no time.

661
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,748
- Juju! Come on!
- What happened?

662
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:46,672
Later.

663
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,069
- He's gone.
- No way.

664
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:57,949
- I tell you, he's gone.
- Have you looked well?

665
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,519
Pierrot!

666
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,678
He's gone!

667
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,793
- We'll celebrate.
- You'll have to drink alone.

668
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,316
The police are sometimes right.

669
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,273
When?

670
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,597
Without the cops he would have 
stayed here the rest of his life.

671
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,558
- You have no feelings.
- Here.

672
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:31,828
- I have no desire to have fun.
- Have one for consolation.

673
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,953
If it's for consolation...

674
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,076
- For Pierrot!
- We did what we could.

675
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:43,356
Where could he be?

676
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,198
You're here!

677
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,273
I can come in?
You expect more visitors?

678
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,874
Don't complain.
It could have been worse.

679
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,079
Worse? I spent the afternoon
thinking that the police would return.

680
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:06,071
They won't come again.

681
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:10,751
Thief! Stealing cans of food...

682
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,669
This is a den of thieves!

683
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,757
Now what happens?

684
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,196
If they decide to charge me,
I'll be passing some time in the shade.

685
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,112
You'll have earned it!

686
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:28,677
That little friend of yours,
who likes the music...

687
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:32,674
- Her name is Maria.
- She comes around a lot.

688
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:36,833
- Maria came by?
- Just after they detained you.

689
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,675
- She lives nearby.
- Maybe too close.

690
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,913
- Sure she doesn't know anything?
- You can't be sure of anything.

691
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,878
- Perhaps someone told her.
- Who could have told?

692
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:52,636
- Who? I'm asking!
- Women find out everything.

693
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,713
They do? Are you sure you
didn't tell her a little?

694
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,037
Maria won't say a word!
She promised.

695
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,274
I'm about to throw your friend out 
into the street!

696
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,838
- Listen, Barbier...
- Got something to say?

697
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,070
- This is my house!
- All right!

698
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:31,031
What are you waiting for?
Go back to the police station!

699
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,352
Tell them where I am.
You'll be given a reward.

700
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,796
Answer me! Do something!

701
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:44,189
Why not break my face?
You have the right!

702
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:50,915
I was wrong.
I deserve to be beaten.

703
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,397
Don't stay out here.
You'll catch cold.

704
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,437
Hit me!

705
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,916
Go to sleep.

706
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,035
Tell me you're not
angry with me.

707
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,550
Let's forget it.

708
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,154
Beware of women,
some of them are whores.

709
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,038
Maria isn't...

710
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,992
The Artist has closed the door.

711
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,754
- He doesn't want to see you again.
- I know.

712
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:24,519
Artist! It's Juju! Open up!

713
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,557
- Go home!
- Pierrot is out here!

714
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,119
- Let him stay there!
- Where could he go?

715
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:32,637
- I don't care!
- I'll shout until you open the door!

716
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,199
- Artist!
- Don't interfere.

717
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:39,354
- Listen, Juju...
- Shut up! We've made peace.

718
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,758
Don't say anything.

719
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,514
Come on, come on! 
What are you waiting for?

720
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:20,476
Maria doesn't seem to mind the cold.
She's acting as if it's Spring.

721
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:24,679
It's better here than out in
the street, don't you think, Artist?

722
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,631
Better than at home.

723
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,759
- What about coal?
- The coalman left nothing.

724
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,435
But I've managed. 
The Artist isn't worrying.

725
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,556
I've been lucky.

726
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,076
To think that within a month
I'll be in the heat.

727
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,879
It will still be Winter.

728
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:02,077
Not for me. In Brazil, it's Summer.

729
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,550
First you have to get there.
You can't get there by car.

730
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,109
- Then I'll fly.
- With what money?

731
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:11,909
Money is everywhere.
Just need to find it.

732
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,913
But you never learn.

733
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:26,792
When I am rich in Brazil, I'll
think of you and send you money.

734
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,589
- What a bundle.
- And you'll drink with me in mind.

735
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:33,638
- No, I won't drink.
- What will you do?

736
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,236
I'll go to the Midi.
To see the blue sky.

737
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,637
Don't you think it's
making too much smoke?

738
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:42,870
No wonder, look at the chimney.

739
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,270
I already fixed it.

740
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,156
- You mean you'll go to Midi?
- Yes, with a girlfriend.

741
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,400
- It's hot!
- Use the handkerchief.

742
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:58,914
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No, I was joking.

743
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,911
This smoke stings my eyes.

744
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:05,039
Hey...what is Maria like?

745
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,158
Maria? She's a good girl.

746
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,751
I've been burned!

747
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,590
How much work you've done.

748
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,918
At least I'm good for something.

749
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,635
I haven't met many
people like you, Juju.

750
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,998
- Everyone says I'm useless.
- Don't listen to them.

751
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:29,358
- I'll never forget you.
- Me neither, Pierrot.

752
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,990
- I thought it would hold.
- You thought...

753
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,390
- I'm no expert!
- I can see that!

754
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,391
- You did a hell of a job.
- Open the window!

755
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:41,755
- It'll let the air out.
- We have to put out the fire.

756
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,388
- It's still smoking.
- Let me do it...

757
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,711
- You're going to burn the place down!
- What happened?

758
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,309
I tripped over the trunk!

759
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,518
No one is as useless as you!

760
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:05,796
You do it, if you dare!

761
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,877
Whenever you do something
it turns into a catastrophe!

762
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,951
Because of you I burned myself!

763
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,429
Whoever says you're useless is right!

764
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,477
And you...

765
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,196
- Where are you going?
- To take the air!

766
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,628
Are you crazy?

767
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,948
- Look at the smoke!
- Fire at the Artist's place!

768
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,874
- No, no fire!
- Fire department!

769
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,428
You're not wrong. It's me.
I'm risking my neck to see you.

770
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:49,273
- Don't stay here.
- Are you scared?

771
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,591
Give me a rum.

772
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,713
- Do they give away glasses?
- Hush, Alphonse!

773
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,838
- What does he want?
- A rum.

774
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,434
- I'll serve.
- Let me do it.

775
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,314
Enough, father and daughter!

776
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:17,069
<i>The day came that wine
ran along the Seine</i>

777
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:23,990
<i>The day came that wine
ran along the Seine</i>

778
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:31,111
<i>And thousands of people
went to drown their sorrows.</i>

779
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:38,675
<i>And thousands of people
went to drown their sorrows.</i>

780
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,715
- Come, Artist!
- What are you waiting for?

781
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,355
- Seems to be the day for it!
- Come on, continue!

782
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:09,438
<i>Goodbye, Seine.</i>

783
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,151
<i>There are the little flowers.
There are the little flowers.</i>

784
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:18,279
<i>There are friends.</i>

785
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:23,912
<i>Goodbye, my heart.
Goodbye, my heart.</i>

786
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,916
<i>When there is no wine
in my cask</i>

787
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:40,671
<i>I'm not afraid to drink
water, no.</i>

788
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:43,670
PIERRE BARBIER
UNTRACEABLE.

789
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:09,034
- Where are you going, Maria?
- To get some air.

790
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,509
Some air...it's raining!

791
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,989
I'll go to the movies.
It doesn't rain in the cinema.

792
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,550
Today the movies,
yesterday a friend's house...

793
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:21,599
Before yesterday to a dance.
Nearly every night.

794
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:24,558
- And then you come back very late.
- So what?

795
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,314
Well, this can not continue.

796
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:29,153
You're right.

797
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,958
- What's he getting at?
- Yes, what are you getting at?

798
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,237
I don't like to stay here
each night with the drunks.

799
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:40,712
- It's up to you.
- Don't mess about. Stop it!

800
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:44,789
You hear that? It's up to you.

801
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:49,790
- You talk. I can't?
- When I speak I know what I mean.

802
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,508
You're old enough to do what you want.

803
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:56,319
Did you hear? I can go out alone.

804
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,790
And her father has
nothing to say about it?

805
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:03,272
- A father is a father.
- You hear? A father is a father!

806
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:07,831
You can go, Maria.
I give you permission.

807
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,912
Don't be angry,
I'll bring her back.

808
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,356
If she's not back in an hour,
tell her to sleep somewhere else.

809
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,829
Easy. She'll find plenty of places.

810
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:23,309
- It is raining.
- We'll run. It's not very far.

811
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,277
- What?
- The cinema.

812
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,749
- The cinema?
- I'll come with you.

813
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:32,876
- No need to come.
- It's no trouble.

814
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,191
I'm not going to the movies.

815
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,877
- Cover up, you're getting drenched.
- No, thanks.

816
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,676
We don't have to go to the movies.
We can go anywhere.

817
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,673
We can't stand here talking.

818
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,596
- Juju...
- What?

819
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,751
Be nice.

820
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:55,198
That's what I want.

821
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,909
- Would you do me a favor?
- Sure!

822
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,439
- Then please go!
- Why?

823
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,832
I need to go to this place alone.

824
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,193
- Really?
- Don't you understand?

825
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:19,796
You don't see anything. Not even
that I'm wearing the same scarf as yours.

826
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:27,517
True, I hadn't noticed.

827
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,590
Hasn't he told you, your friend?

828
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,512
How would you know?

829
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:37,754
You told me where he was.
He says you saved his life.

830
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,111
I appreciate it very much.

831
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,551
Goodnight, Juju.

832
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,631
Won't you say goodnight?

833
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,035
Goodnight, Maria.

834
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,919
We're still friends, right?

835
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,399
Yes.

836
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,558
Then give me a kiss.

837
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,994
Don't say anything.

838
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,557
You know I would never say anything.

839
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:51,676
- Is Juju here?
- Yes.

840
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,798
- And I don't think he can move.
- I have to see him.

841
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,475
First you need to sober him up.

842
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,870
You'll be lucky if you can wake him.

843
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:03,395
He didn't drink that much.

844
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:08,031
- I couldn't keep up.
- He's recovered by now.

845
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,233
Your friend's in a lot of pain.

846
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:25,030
- What are you doing here?
- I have the passport.

847
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:28,918
- The passport?
- The one he asked for.

848
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,389
- So what?
- He can go now.

849
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:35,997
- Who?
- Our Friend! He'll leave!

850
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,669
- He'll go?
- Yes.

851
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,709
So I'm no longer needed.

852
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:45,074
No one needs me.

853
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:55,319
That's it! With this paper
you can go around the world.

854
01:20:55,480 --> 01:21:00,349
On the condition you have a
photo. And we have it!

855
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,880
- Juju, are you deaf?
- No.

856
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:06,429
- Are you worried about something?
- Yes.

857
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:09,313
Why am I leaving?

858
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,994
Couldn't last forever, right?

859
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:14,350
No, not forever.

860
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:18,439
The Artist isn't sad. He gave
me his name so I could leave.

861
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:23,591
He looks good in photos.
Hop! I have changed!

862
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:27,031
Barbier takes his place.
A good job, right?

863
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,634
Hardly noticeable.

864
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:35,032
Arrived at the border. Police.
"Passport?" Please.

865
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:38,516
I'll look. "Occupation?"

866
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,150
Musician. Is everything in order?
"Yes, sir."

867
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,675
- Say "Bon voyage."
- Bon voyage.

868
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:48,196
Thank you, Mr. Inspector.
Goodbye Police! Goodbye France!

869
01:21:48,360 --> 01:21:50,794
Away I go! Life is beautiful!
I win!

870
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:01,032
Have you broken something?
What happened?

871
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:05,869
The cat. It's bad luck.

872
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:06,790
No!

873
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,270
When I said that life
is beautiful! It's a bad omen.

874
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:12,556
- Nonsense.
- Oh yes!

875
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,234
- I'll wring it's neck!
- Are you crazy?

876
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,836
I should have done it before!

877
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:26,589
Hello, Artist. 
We've come to see you.

878
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,873
We can come in and talk?

879
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,879
- Tell me.
- Come, Paulo.

880
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:38,318
- No, you.
- Who lives in your house?

881
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,759
Nobody.

882
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,310
- Who was here last night?
- Juju.

883
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:49,314
No, Juju was in the bar.

884
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:55,396
Juju got drunk.
Do you mind letting me in?

885
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:00,475
- What are you getting at?
- Let me in.

886
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,793
Come in.

887
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:07,274
You realize this is my home.

888
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:10,478
I don't like people coming
in to inspect it.

889
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:16,555
I don't like my daughter
coming here to meet someone.

890
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,117
- I don't understand.
- Tell me what you know, Paulo.

891
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:22,714
- I know nothing.
- What did you see?

892
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:29,436
From my house I saw Maria
come out through this door.

893
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,716
And the door closed
behind her.

894
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:40,559
Someone closed the door
when she left, do you understand?

895
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,518
- Who?
- That's what I want to know.

896
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,871
- I can't explain it.
- I'll give you some advice:

897
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:51,472
If someone you don't know
closed that door,

898
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:55,598
tell the police.
I'll take care of it if you like.

899
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:59,958
If you don't know who's meeting
my daughter, I'll find out.

900
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:04,949
- Don't meddle in someone else's business.
- You're right.

901
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,473
Yes, I heard.

902
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:26,673
All clear.
Okay, pass me the suitcase.

903
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,590
Do I bring these or not?
No, it would be foolish.

904
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:36,833
Shirts with my initials...
You can sell it all later.

905
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,070
Aren't you taking anything?

906
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,958
I'll take this.
Just in case we run into trouble.

907
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,271
Alphonse won't do anything.

908
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:49,238
- You never know.
- Maybe you shouldn't go.

909
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,870
Here I'd just sleep more.

910
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:57,160
Come, you go first.

911
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,028
You can go.

912
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:11,077
- Perhaps we'll meet again.
- Where will you sleep?

913
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,718
- On the train. Tomorrow I'll be gone.
- What about money?

914
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:17,750
I'll find it. Goodbye, Juju.

915
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:22,309
You're like a brother.
You've done a lot for me.

916
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,679
What I could. Nothing more.

917
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,637
- You could...
- What?

918
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,279
Maria.

919
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,393
Maria?

920
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,677
Take this, give it to her.

921
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,795
Just a couple of lines.
To say goodbye.

922
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:41,752
I'll give it to her.

923
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,637
Do it now.

924
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:50,113
It's the last thing I ask.

925
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:24,470
I have to go to him.
Say you're taking me dancing.

926
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,677
What singing!
It hurts my ears!

927
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,594
- Go on, don't listen to him.
- Go on without me.

928
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,918
- Maria, are you coming?
- Where are you going?

929
01:26:37,080 --> 01:26:40,789
- To dance. I'll take you dancing.
- I'll get a shawl.

930
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,793
No way.
You're not going anywhere.

931
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,679
- I'm going with Juju!
- I don't care!

932
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:49,832
- Be reasonable.
- I'll do as I like!

933
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,992
Continue!

934
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:38,871
I'll be waiting for him just
like at the dancehall. Take this.

935
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,555
Tell him to find me.

936
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:45,349
- As we agreed.
- As you agreed.

937
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:47,431
In Marseille.

938
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,116
In Marseille. Why?

939
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,511
I don't have time to explain.
Quick, someone could come.

940
01:27:55,720 --> 01:27:58,154
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm going. 

941
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:01,790
Tell him I only
think of him.

942
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:05,273
You only think of him...

943
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,550
- What are you doing here?
- Maria...

944
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:27,359
- Is she coming?
- She can't come.

945
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:32,392
- What did she say?
- She's only thinking of you.

946
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:35,518
- What's this?
- She sent it.

947
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,756
You should have given it first.

948
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:42,438
It's all I need.

949
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:46,992
Money is no problem. I only need 
to know how to speak to the girls...

950
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,391
Maria didn't say anything?

951
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,074
You'll find her in Marseille.

952
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:57,153
In Marseille. Okay.
Goodbye, my friend.

953
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,119
You're taking Maria?

954
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,034
Poor fool! What kind of life
would she have with Barbier?

955
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:14,797
Easy, when she gets to Marseille,
I'll be long gone.

956
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:18,555
- Then...
- I don't want to drag her along.

957
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,472
- Then...
- What?

958
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,798
And apologize again
to her father.

959
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:28,988
- What then?
- I thought you were a hustler, like me!

960
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:32,435
In life, everyone should
look out for themselves.

961
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:36,275
- Don't you ever think of others?
- I have no time.

962
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:43,233
- No way.
- What?

963
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:47,951
- You can't do this!
- We'll talk another day.

964
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:57,518
- Anything else?
- You can not do this to Maria!

965
01:29:57,680 --> 01:30:00,558
She's a girl like all the others!

966
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:03,280
- No.
- They are all whores!

967
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,317
Maria isn't.

968
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:10,349
Are you in love with her?
My poor friend!

969
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:13,637
In this life?
You have no chance.

970
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:16,310
You're not good with women.

971
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,833
Go drink to my health.
It's easier.

972
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:24,315
Pierrot! Give me that money!

973
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,595
Alphonse's money?
Worried about Alphonse?

974
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:33,390
- When Maria finds out...
- When she finds out what?

975
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:36,790
That you never loved her...

976
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,952
You've done this for money.

977
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:43,750
She'll learn to not
be such an idiot.

978
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,559
Pierrot, you can't.

979
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:52,795
Juju, if you don't let me go...

980
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,349
- You can't leave.
- I won't tell you again!

981
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:00,389
- You can't go!
- Leave, Juju! Or it'll be bad for you.

982
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,478
Makes you think, doesn't it?

983
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:08,315
Yes, makes me wonder.

984
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:20,398
- What is it? Are you hot?
- I thought I heard firecrackers.

985
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,192
The dogs are barking.

986
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:07,911
Don't whistle.
Not now.

987
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:11,755
- Why?
- You have no feelings.

988
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:19,238
What will you do with the money?

989
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,909
Return it to Maria.

990
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:25,754
So nobody knows anything.

991
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,480
What will you tell her?

992
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,710
I will tell her...

993
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:36,553
I will say...Pierrot
no longer needed it.

994
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,996
- What about you?
- I don't want any.
995 01:32: 49,680 --> 01:32: 53,753 
- But you haven't had any. 
- You need it more than I do.
