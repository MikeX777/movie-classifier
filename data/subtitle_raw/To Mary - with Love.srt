2
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:04,771
- Yes, sir?
- I want to send some flowers.

3
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:06,272
Yes, Mr. Wallace.

4
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:08,573
Two dozen roses, big ones.

5
00:02:09,274 --> 00:02:10,774
I'll get a card ready.

6
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,300
This is my first trip to New York.
Would you drive me down to Grant's Tomb?

7
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:01,606
More sightseeing tonight,
but I want to see Grant's Tomb.

8
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:06,707
# Eastside, Westside #

9
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:10,907
Mr. O'Shaughnessy!
Paging Mr. O'Shaughnessy!

10
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:13,508
Paging Mr. O'Shaughnessy!

11
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:17,109
# London Bridge is falling down #

12
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,510
# Boys and girls together #

13
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:25,011
# Me and Mamie O'Rourke #

14
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:28,512
# Tripped the light fantastic #

15
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:37,213
Oh, why don't you just hurry?

16
00:03:37,214 --> 00:03:41,814
Boy, Fenwick goes 100% for Jimmy!
That's Albany shifting. Congratulations!

17
00:03:41,815 --> 00:03:44,715
- What's them for?
- Champagne, sir.

18
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:47,916
Yeah, well us Democrats drink
whiskey.

19
00:03:49,017 --> 00:03:50,717
I noticed that.

20
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:15,218
Oh, I'm sorry. We've been troubled
by wandering ward heelers. Thanks.

21
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:18,919
Whoopee! Queens goes for
Jimmy Jones! Boy, it's a landslide!

22
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,520
Wasn't it practically the keenest
wedding you've ever been to?

23
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,821
- Yes or no?
- Yes, definitely.

24
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:37,922
Oh, darling, don't let it ever be
any more wonderful than it is now,

25
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:40,123
because if it is, I couldn't bear it.

26
00:04:46,324 --> 00:04:48,824
Oh, wait, we're embarrassing
our best man.

27
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:50,300
Where is everybody, tell us best man.

28
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:52,126
Come on, wizard, do your miracle.

29
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:03,727
- Pre-war.
- Ah, good old pre-war!

30
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:09,428
Listen, my children, you shall hear
the midnight pop of Pol Roger 1914.

31
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,400
Hot diggety! Champagne!

32
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:13,900
Come on. My mother told
me about it!

33
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:18,000
- No, no, you wouldn't like it.
- Oh, Mr. Hallam, please!

34
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,602
No drink at all!

35
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,603
We should set pearls before swine.

36
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:25,504
To the happy pair!

37
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:27,405
Or maybe somebody else
should have said that.

38
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:29,006
Mud in your eye!

39
00:05:29,007 --> 00:05:32,007
How I love those simple,
gracious old-fashioned toasts.

40
00:05:33,008 --> 00:05:36,608
It's a little early to be making plans yet,
but do you know what, Bill?

41
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,109
We're going to name
the first one after you.

42
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,310
Because I love you
and Jock loves you.

43
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:44,081
- In fact, we think you're the berries.
- Yes, we do.

44
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:46,982
Well, that's fine, because I think
you're the berries too.

45
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:49,383
Both of you.
Always have and always will.

46
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:51,984
Why don't you get married, Bill?
Did you ever think about it?

47
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:57,085
Not me. I know when I'm lucky.

48
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,186
Goodbye, Mary.

49
00:06:02,687 --> 00:06:04,007
Why, you dumb bunny.

50
00:06:04,008 --> 00:06:06,900
Aren't you going to take advantage
of your chance to kiss the bride?

51
00:06:13,601 --> 00:06:15,301
Hm, that tastes familiar.

52
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:19,202
Once when I ws eleven and the other
time when I was thirteen, remember?

53
00:06:23,003 --> 00:06:24,903
You'll, um... miss your boat.

54
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:27,404
Oh, you're telling me
Come on, darling!

55
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:31,505
Hey, O'Hara! We've got the Bronx
in the palm of our hands.

56
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:36,306
Out of 18 districts we got...
Where's O'Hara?

57
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:39,407
You promised me a glimpse of Al Smith
and what do I get?

58
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:41,708
- O'Hara!
- Should we tell him?

59
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,909
Yes, but break it to him gently.

60
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,510
Bad news, pal. O'Hara is...
O'Hara is...

61
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:54,501
He ain't hurt, is he?

62
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:56,600
Hurt? If it were only that.

63
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:59,301
O'Hara's gone over the Great Divide, pal.
He choked on a ???

64
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:03,502
He was the best man a man ever had.

65
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:06,003
He owed me 47 bucks.

66
00:07:06,004 --> 00:07:09,700
Hi-ho lackaday, we all must
go some time.

67
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:11,501
Here today, gone tomo...

68
00:07:11,502 --> 00:07:15,000
Pardon me, but that wouldn't
be champagne, would it?

69
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,200
- I'm a stranger here myself.
- Yes, yes, have some.

70
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:19,601
A drink for the bride.

71
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:23,702
Personally, I've never been a bride,
but they tell me it's quite an experience.

72
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:26,103
And now to the groom, poor chap.

73
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:29,500
Oh, no, the other one. Don't get me
confused at this point, please.

74
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:31,199
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

75
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,800
I mean, I really am sorry.

76
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:42,701
Well, darling, I think we've got to hurry
if we want to catch that boat.

77
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:44,672
Well, goodbye, Bill.
Goodbye, Miss...

78
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,200
Brant. Kitty Brant.

79
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:48,501
Plaza 3405.

80
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:52,282
He may be out of circulation,
but I'm not.

81
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:54,283
Lady, the name is Hallam.

82
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:57,984
He's heart-whole and fancy-free
and he can also do card tricks.

83
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:00,105
Well, come on, all ashore that's
going ashore. Goodbye, Bill.

84
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:01,999
- Goodbye, Miss Brant.
- Bye!

85
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,500
O'Hara!

86
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:12,101
Wise guy!

87
00:08:12,102 --> 00:08:15,202
Oh, Jimmy, me lad, they told me...

88
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:17,903
- Bye!
- Goodbye, Bill.

89
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:22,504
Very nice your friend,
what does he do?

90
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:24,055
He's an architect.

91
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:26,256
I'm nice too once you get
to know me.

92
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:28,907
- Have another drink?
- Why not?

93
00:08:37,008 --> 00:08:40,308
So, you're heart-whole
and fancy-free, are you?

94
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:45,009
How long have you been
in love with her?

95
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,510
- Who?
- Don't quibble.

96
00:08:48,511 --> 00:08:53,111
You don't seem to get it. She just
got married to a Mr. John Wallace.

97
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:56,602
- You know, the handsome one.
- Sure, I know. What of it?

98
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,903
It just so happens that he is
my best friend.

99
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:03,304
Oh, I understand. Just pals, eh?

100
00:09:03,305 --> 00:09:06,105
Well, isn't that simply dandy?

101
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:08,206
Darby and Joan and another guy.

102
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:11,207
Damon and Pythias and a girlfriend.

103
00:09:13,508 --> 00:09:17,808
Is it your impression that
the best things in life are three?

104
00:09:17,809 --> 00:09:18,809
No.

105
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,310
That's good, because it isn't
mine either.

106
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:24,811
How would you like to get
quietly cockeyed?

107
00:09:25,312 --> 00:09:27,212
I'd love it.

108
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:45,513
- Monsieur, absolument pas.
- Non, mercredi!

109
00:09:45,514 --> 00:09:48,614
Mais non, Monsieur, je vous assure.
Enfin, Madame en refuse.

110
00:09:48,615 --> 00:09:51,800
Elle commande des fleurs lundi,
mardi, mercredi, jeudi...

111
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:54,706
Mais elle refuse tous, voyons!

112
00:09:55,107 --> 00:09:57,107
- Oui?
- Wallace.

113
00:09:57,108 --> 00:09:59,108
- Wallasse?
- Wallace.

114
00:09:59,109 --> 00:10:02,709
Mr. Hampton's car calling
for Mr. and Mrs. Wallace.

115
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,700
- Walasse?
- Wallace.

116
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:06,101
Wallace?

117
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:10,602
Ah, voilà, Mr. Wallace.

118
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:11,603
Wallace.

119
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:12,774
Mr. Wallace.

120
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:15,175
Est-ce que je peux compter
sur des violettes por demain?

121
00:10:15,376 --> 00:10:18,176
Mais non, je veux pas que vous
manquez cette...

122
00:10:21,577 --> 00:10:24,200
Jock! Answer the phone!

123
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:26,301
Or the door or something.

124
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:27,902
All right, come in.

125
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:32,703
You ought to say "Entrez", darling.

126
00:10:32,704 --> 00:10:34,500
Remember, when in Rome.

127
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,101
Tell him we'll be down in a minute.

128
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:40,600
- The Hamptons' car awaits, madame.
- Oh, dear, already?

129
00:10:40,602 --> 00:10:42,600
See if the studs are in my shirt,
darling, will you?

130
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:47,603
Remember those carefree days
of my girlhood?

131
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:49,604
When I had only myself to dress?

132
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:53,005
Uh-huh. Now you have me,
you lucky little woman.

133
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:55,906
- Oh, look!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

134
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:57,407
I'll find it.

135
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:00,408
You never have yet.

136
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:05,409
Oh, your strawberry mark.
I love it.

137
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,110
I almost had it taken off once.
I'm glad I didn't now.

138
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:10,901
If you ever do, I'll sue you.

139
00:11:16,702 --> 00:11:20,402
- Jock, darling, we've got to rush.
- Oh, all right.

140
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:25,303
- I always did hate operas anyway.
- Oh, a little culture won't hurt you.

141
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:28,404
Who used to do this before
we were married?

142
00:11:28,405 --> 00:11:31,305
Oh, I don't know, lots of people.
Lady upstairs, lady downstairs,

143
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:32,900
lady across the hall.

144
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,701
Kindly souls all of them.

145
00:11:34,702 --> 00:11:37,602
Always willing to lend a helping hand
to a poor bachelor.

146
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:39,203
I can imagine.

147
00:11:41,204 --> 00:11:44,004
- What shall it be tonight, the red?
- No, the white.

148
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:46,005
That's what you always say.

149
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:49,306
- Don't you ever get tired of white?
- Not on you.

150
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,407
All right, you win.

151
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:55,908
What would you have done
if I had worn the red?

152
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:58,209
I don't know. Created a scene.

153
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:01,400
- Beat you, maybe.
- Really? Marvelous.

154
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:04,601
Well, anyway, I'd have thrown
something at you.

155
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:07,999
Here.

156
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,500
Sooner or later you'll have to learn
to do this yourself.

157
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,001
Stand still.

158
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:19,802
- You talk too much.
- Darling, stand still!

159
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:23,303
There.

160
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,404
Looks pretty good if I do
say so myself.

161
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:29,405
Oh, Jock, we've got to hurry.

162
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:32,206
I'm ready. You're the one
who's holding things up.

163
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:33,657
Oh, that's gratitude.

164
00:12:33,658 --> 00:12:38,958
I work my fingers to the bone for you,
I slave and slave over a hot stove.

165
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,500
Oh, Jock, you look beautiful.

166
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:44,001
No, you're beautiful, I'm merely...
merely handsome.

167
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:46,302
Of all the conceit.
But you're beautiful too.

168
00:12:46,303 --> 00:12:48,403
Well, if you insist.

169
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:49,904
Hook me up.

170
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:55,805
Now, who did this before I did,
may I ask?

171
00:12:57,006 --> 00:13:00,406
Oh, the gentleman upstairs,
the gentleman downstairs,

172
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:02,607
- the gentleman across the hall.
- Liar.

173
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:05,908
Neither one of us ever lived before
we were married and you know it.

174
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:10,209
We simply ate... and slept...

175
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,310
and talked...

176
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:15,611
and walked.

177
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:20,212
It's true, isn't it?

178
00:13:20,513 --> 00:13:23,813
- Think of the years we've wasted.
- Oh, my darling.

179
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:30,114
Jock... they're waiting.

180
00:13:30,115 --> 00:13:32,015
Let them wait.

181
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:02,516
This ain't half as good as the reception
they gave Bertrand Adderley.

182
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:08,817
If anyone asks your name,
remember it's full of consonants.

183
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:14,999
There they are, see?

184
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,700
Mary! John!

185
00:14:20,001 --> 00:14:21,601
Oh, there he is!
Hey, Bill!

186
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:23,402
Look, Bill!
Look.

187
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:26,403
- Who's that with him?
- Bentley's sweetheart, remember?

188
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:29,904
- Bill!
- Bill! Bill, darling!

189
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:37,400
I adore your strange taste of
your beautiful women. Bill, how are you?

190
00:14:37,401 --> 00:14:39,000
- Hello, Bill.
- How was Paris, did you have a rough trip?

191
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:40,780
- You remember Kitty Brant, don't you?
- Of course we do.

192
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:42,900
- Bill, did you get our letters?
- Oh, did he?

193
00:14:42,922 --> 00:14:46,642
He read them aloud to me and told me
your life from the time you wore knee pants.

194
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:49,843
After that we went to London...
Oh, wait a minute.

195
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:52,644
Jock, don't forget the... you know.

196
00:14:52,645 --> 00:14:54,445
Oh, yes, I know, I know.

197
00:14:55,246 --> 00:14:56,946
- Look.
- Here, let me...

198
00:14:56,947 --> 00:14:58,547
Shh!

199
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:05,748
Well, Kitty, hello!

200
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:08,349
Well, of all people. How are Mama
and Papa and all the kiddies?

201
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,150
- And Aunt Elsie
- Aunt Elsie's fine and...

202
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:14,151
And how are you?

203
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:17,452
Thanks.

204
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:19,253
Thanks a lot.

205
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:21,004
Thank you.

206
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:26,205
I'm bearing precious cargo.

207
00:15:26,206 --> 00:15:28,406
Bump me and I gurgle.

208
00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:32,007
Wallace! Mr. Wallace!

209
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,108
Is this yours?

210
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:38,209
Don't move, Bill, we don't want
to lose you.

211
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,770
Oh, look, Peggy Joyce just came in.

212
00:15:52,771 --> 00:15:55,971
Boy, we're in the money.
At last we meet nice people.

213
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:59,272
I catch pneumonia just to see
Peggy Joyce.

214
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:01,773
Oh, now, honey, we ought to have
a little fun, don't we?

215
00:16:04,374 --> 00:16:07,574
You know, um... I'd like to buy
this piece of land.

216
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:11,175
Any piece of land you wouldn't like to buy?
That's all I've heard from you lately.

217
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:12,176
And me too.

218
00:16:12,177 --> 00:16:15,800
Girls, never marry an architect
with delusions of grandeur.

219
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:17,901
Take it from one who's been
through the mill.

220
00:16:19,802 --> 00:16:21,802
Jock, I'm interested.

221
00:16:26,203 --> 00:16:27,603
All right!

222
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:30,504
Look. I'll let you in on a secret.

223
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:33,400
- I'm going to make a million dollars.
- Jock Hallan, that's marvelous!

224
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,006
- When?
- And how, if you don't mind?

225
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:37,307
Well, not designing buildings
for somebody else, that's certain.

226
00:16:37,308 --> 00:16:39,508
What's become of those fancy
ideas you used to have?

227
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:42,409
You know, introducing a Renaissance
of American architecture.

228
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,400
Fancy ideals is right.
Architects never made any money.

229
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,001
If they did, it took them
a lifetime to do it.

230
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:49,902
- But promoters, ah!
- You mean you're going to be a promoter?

231
00:16:49,903 --> 00:16:52,200
Yep, it's simple.
You pyramid.

232
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:54,800
- You mean "you' pyramid.
- All right, I pyramid.

233
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:56,500
Look, I buy a property, see?

234
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:58,881
In six months it's worth twice
its original cost.

235
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:01,700
Then I sell it. and then I reinvest
the profits in another.

236
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,701
What if that happens?
Then where are you?

237
00:17:03,702 --> 00:17:06,602
Probably flat on your face,
but you had a lot of fun.

238
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:08,700
Oh, no, it can't happen.
It can't possibly happen.

239
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:11,201
We're on the verge of an era
of expansion here.

240
00:17:11,202 --> 00:17:12,672
See what a gay world our life is?

241
00:17:12,673 --> 00:17:16,173
We have subdivisions for breakfast,
residential projects for lunch...

242
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:39,174
Ladies and gentlemen!

243
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:44,175
Ladies and gentlemen.

244
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:48,706
And now, for the championship
of the world,

245
00:17:48,707 --> 00:17:53,700
in this corner, at 185 and a half,

246
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:58,801
??? Gene Tunney.

247
00:18:02,508 --> 00:18:07,008
In this corner, at 190,

248
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:13,509
well-known "Malassa Mauler"
and present champion, Jack Dempsey!

249
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:22,310
Oh, look at those prefectly darling
blue trunk pants he's wearing.

250
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:28,611
I'm a sucker for the refined type.
I'll take Tunney, thanks.

251
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:30,412
Don't worry, so will Dempsey.

252
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:11,613
Mr. Mr. Alfred Brendan.
Brendan!

253
00:19:14,814 --> 00:19:17,014
You're cold, darling.
Here, relax.

254
00:19:17,715 --> 00:19:19,515
What's the matter, aren't you tired?

255
00:19:20,216 --> 00:19:24,916
Did anyone ever tell you that all work
and no play makes Jock a dull boy?

256
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,000
Yeah, but a rich one too.

257
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:28,101
Oh, say, you know
what I heard yesterday?

258
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:29,600
You know the Waldorf Astoria?

259
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:32,700
I ought to, because I remember
we were married in it, weren't we?

260
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:35,000
- At least I was.
- This is strictly confidential.

261
00:19:35,001 --> 00:19:37,200
- They're going to tear it down.
- Oh, Jock, they couldn't do that.

262
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,301
- They are, yeah.
- The Waldorf's history.

263
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:41,102
Like Concord or Lexington.

264
00:19:41,123 --> 00:19:43,200
I know, but they're going to build
the world's tallest building...

265
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,800
...right on the same sight. Harper says
the combine's forming down.

266
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:48,601
I might be able to get a little piece of it,
wouldn't that be wonderful?

267
00:19:49,402 --> 00:19:52,500
Jock, I'm scared.

268
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:54,201
Of what? My judgment?

269
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:56,302
Is this a wife's touchy phase?

270
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:59,783
Darling, you stick with me and you'll
wear bigger diamonds than this one.

271
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:02,384
I don't want bigger diamonds.

272
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:04,285
- I want...
- What?

273
00:20:04,486 --> 00:20:06,686
Some fun out of life.

274
00:20:07,587 --> 00:20:11,187
Like... like those people over there.

275
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:23,088
Yes, I know.

276
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,589
You want us to be like that.

277
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:28,890
I want to...

278
00:20:30,391 --> 00:20:31,791
Listen, darling, we're married now.

279
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:34,092
We ought to take on things
that marriage means.

280
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:38,293
- Two's flying, but three...
- Oh, that again.

281
00:20:38,294 --> 00:20:41,094
Jock, I've told you over and over.

282
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:44,095
I'm willing to take on all the things
that marriage means.

283
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:47,396
But there's no reason why we should
tie ourselves down so soon.

284
00:20:50,797 --> 00:20:52,097
Oh, darling.

285
00:20:52,098 --> 00:20:54,298
Let's not be serious.

286
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:56,599
From now on till after we
go to Maine, I...

287
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,400
Now what's the matter?

288
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:04,201
I can't be running off on vacations, dear.

289
00:21:04,202 --> 00:21:06,502
Don't you realize I'm trying
to build a future for us?

290
00:21:06,503 --> 00:21:08,403
It takes work, and it takes time.

291
00:21:08,404 --> 00:21:12,104
I'm no playboy, I'm a businessman.
We'll have to postpone Maine.

292
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,605
Postpone it? You can't postpone
somebody else's house party.

293
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:18,106
The Crandall's are counting on us.
And I'm going.

294
00:21:18,107 --> 00:21:19,707
Alone if necessary.

295
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,408
Say, listen. What are you, a prom girl
or a married woman?

296
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:25,809
You can't go on wearing
orange blossoms, you know?

297
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:28,210
Honeymoons don't last forever

298
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:32,911
- Later on perhaps, dear, we can go...
- Later. Always later.

299
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:36,312
We're going to have a wonderful time
when we're ninety, aren't we?

300
00:21:36,313 --> 00:21:38,313
- Any old rag?
- Any old bone?

301
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:40,914
Well, if you're so set on Maine,
why don't you...

302
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:43,215
...ask Bill to go with you, he's got
a vacation coming up.

303
00:21:43,216 --> 00:21:45,316
All right, I will then.

304
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:48,317
I'm sure I wouldn't want to go
with you in your mood anyway.

305
00:21:48,318 --> 00:21:50,118
Kitty, would you let me sit in there?

306
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:53,119
You bet.

307
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,020
Oh, be sure to give that back.

308
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,821
The Elks awarded it to me as the girl
who goes for them.

309
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:03,340
What's all this about?
You'll ask me where?

310
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:06,241
To a house party up in Maine next week,
do you want to go?

311
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,942
Oh, why, sure. What about Jock?

312
00:22:09,993 --> 00:22:12,343
Other plans as usual.

313
00:22:15,744 --> 00:22:18,844
Well, stone face, how about
a little conversation?

314
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:22,045
I just had one, thanks.

315
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:46,300
Oh, dear, I wish I had stopped
and freshened myself up first.

316
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:48,847
If he loves you,
he'll take you in clean or dirty.

317
00:22:52,548 --> 00:22:53,448
Shh!

318
00:22:53,449 --> 00:22:55,700
Is that you idea of a surprise entrance?

319
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,701
Where's your sense of drama?

320
00:22:59,502 --> 00:23:01,302
Oh, dear, I'm all aquiver.

321
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:05,203
Isn't that ridiculous?

322
00:23:05,204 --> 00:23:09,004
Some women leave their husbands for months
and after a mere ten days, I'm in a twitch.

323
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:13,805
Poor Mary, maudlin Mary.

324
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:17,306
The human-clinging vine,
No self-reliance, no stamina.

325
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:36,707
All right, then I will call you.

326
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,108
I said I would, didn't I?

327
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:45,509
Surprise! Surprise.!

328
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,210
Well, I'll be.

329
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:50,511
I'll... I'll call you back.

330
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,452
Tell them you have to go into
a heavy conference at this time.

331
00:23:52,453 --> 00:23:53,453
I can't talk now.

332
00:23:53,954 --> 00:23:56,654
The one and only Mrs. Wallace!

333
00:24:00,655 --> 00:24:03,855
Oh, I was a nasty, disagreeable,
self-centered little idiot.

334
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:06,356
To run off and leave you like that.

335
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:10,157
But I was punished all right. I had
a rotten time every minute I was gone.

336
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,958
Who were you talking to?

337
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:15,659
- Why, er...
- What a man! What a man!

338
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,160
Did you miss me?
Did you pine and sigh?

339
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:21,461
You don't look as if you did.
You look disgustingly healthy.

340
00:24:21,462 --> 00:24:23,862
Well, I was too busy to do much pining.
But I thought of you a lot.

341
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,263
Oh, you!

342
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,564
I did, yes, I did.
Really I did.

343
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:29,365
I'm glad you're back, terribly glad.

344
00:24:29,366 --> 00:24:32,066
See? Evasions, subterfuges.

345
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:34,367
Look at him blush.

346
00:24:34,368 --> 00:24:36,808
- Why, honey, you are blushing.
- Oh, nonsense.

347
00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:41,209
Fix us a highball or something.
We're parched.

348
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,999
I discovered a new bootlegger
while you were gone.

349
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,100
Remarkable fellow, he reads palms.
Vegetarian too.

350
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:50,801
Everybody sent loads of love to you.

351
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:53,502
Liz Chalmers. You remember her,
don't you?

352
00:24:53,503 --> 00:24:55,999
That lovely little cross-eyed number.

353
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,400
Well, my dear, she's at last succeeded
in getting herself engaged.

354
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:05,301
And they're going to stage the most
enormous and expensive...

355
00:25:07,002 --> 00:25:08,999
Expensive what?

356
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,800
So far he hasn't even raised
an eyebrow.

357
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,401
No wonder you didn't
pine and sigh.

358
00:25:31,202 --> 00:25:33,302
You didn't have to.

359
00:25:33,303 --> 00:25:36,803
That compact doesn't mean anything,
Mary, I swear it doesn't.

360
00:25:36,804 --> 00:25:40,104
Doesn't it?
Oh, Jock...

361
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:43,005
Jock!

362
00:25:43,406 --> 00:25:44,706
Mary!

363
00:25:44,707 --> 00:25:46,107
Oh, Marry, look. Here...

364
00:25:46,108 --> 00:25:48,808
Mary! Mary!

365
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:52,109
Locking the door when we have to talk.
Now you're being silly.

366
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,610
Bill.

367
00:25:54,911 --> 00:25:56,800
Bill, what'll I do?

368
00:25:56,801 --> 00:25:58,701
She's got to listen to me,
she's got to!

369
00:26:01,002 --> 00:26:04,302
Better think fast, Captain Flag.

370
00:26:20,303 --> 00:26:21,503
Mary!

371
00:26:21,504 --> 00:26:23,004
Mary!

372
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:25,005
Let me in!

373
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:33,606
Mary! Mary!

374
00:27:00,107 --> 00:27:02,207
- You can't go.
- Can't I?

375
00:27:17,208 --> 00:27:19,108
You haven't even let me try to explain.

376
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:22,769
You don't have to explain.
These things happen every day, don't they?

377
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,770
You read about them in books, you...
you see them on the stage.

378
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:30,231
But they happen to me only once, Jock.

379
00:27:30,242 --> 00:27:31,600
- Let me go.
- No.

380
00:27:31,601 --> 00:27:34,000
Let me go!
- Look, Mary, she came up one evening.

381
00:27:34,001 --> 00:27:36,901
Just one evening because she knew a politician
who could help me on the Waldorf deal.

382
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:39,002
The three of us sat around
and had a couple of drinks, we talked.

383
00:27:39,003 --> 00:27:41,803
- That's all.
- Don't lie, Jock, don't lie!

384
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,904
I'm not lying! Don't you think
I'd have hidden the compact...

385
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:45,605
...if I had anything to be ashamed of?

386
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:48,800
Oh, darling, I'll get down
on my knees to you.

387
00:27:48,801 --> 00:27:50,501
I'll do anything, anything!

388
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,400
Up in Maine I didn't sleep
thinking of you.

389
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:56,003
I used to lie and look at
the clock go round.

390
00:27:56,004 --> 00:27:58,204
I'd wonder what you were doing.

391
00:27:58,205 --> 00:28:00,505
I'd try to guess.

392
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,704
I'd think, now he's reading.

393
00:28:04,505 --> 00:28:07,205
Now he's turning out the lights.

394
00:28:07,206 --> 00:28:10,206
Now he's lying there in the dark
just as I am here.

395
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:13,907
But, Mary, you've got to trust me.
You've got to believe me and believe in me.

396
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:20,208
You brought her here. In this apartment
that we planned and furnished together.

397
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:23,400
She sat on that couch.

398
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:27,601
- She...
- No, it wasn't that way!

399
00:28:27,602 --> 00:28:29,602
- Let me go, Jock.
- You're here in my arms.

400
00:28:29,603 --> 00:28:32,803
That's the only truth there is.
Can't you believe what you feel?

401
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:34,004
- No...
- Mary!

402
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:45,505
Hold me close.

403
00:28:45,906 --> 00:28:48,406
Never let me go.

404
00:28:51,107 --> 00:28:53,107
25th floor.
All out, please.

405
00:28:53,608 --> 00:28:55,208
Going up.

406
00:28:58,209 --> 00:29:02,409
Well, fine business organization this.
Where is everybody?

407
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:06,210
They say your husband works here.
A likely story, a likely story.

408
00:29:08,411 --> 00:29:09,711
Oh!

409
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:30,112
- Are we late?
- No, no. Come in, come in.

410
00:29:30,113 --> 00:29:32,213
Lindberg's still way down by
the Battery.

411
00:29:33,514 --> 00:29:36,004
Hello, darling. How are you feeling?

412
00:29:37,605 --> 00:29:40,505
I feel fine, foolish.
Why shouldn't I?

413
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:43,406
And I knew you when?

414
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:46,800
Bill! Look!

415
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:48,900
Yes, sir, there, ladies and gentlemen,
you have something.

416
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:53,500
- Or you will have once it's built.
- Oh, Jock, it's gorgeous. It's magnificent.

417
00:29:53,532 --> 00:29:55,252
Couldn't have done a better
design myself.

418
00:29:55,253 --> 00:29:57,300
I should hope not.
Looks pretty expensive, Jock.

419
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,654
Sure you're not getting in
over your head?

420
00:29:58,655 --> 00:30:01,500
No, not me. Oh, I mortgaged my shirt
and a few other things, but...

421
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:03,401
I'm all set now.

422
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:05,902
Look, here's the... this is the main
clubhouse here.

423
00:30:05,903 --> 00:30:08,103
Here's the pool with fresh water.

424
00:30:08,104 --> 00:30:10,600
- No perfume?
- Oh, here's the ballroom.

425
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:14,401
With a sliding roof so that people
can dance under the stars.

426
00:30:14,402 --> 00:30:16,302
On the edge of precipices.

427
00:30:16,303 --> 00:30:19,353
Honest, Jock, this thing's got
elephantiasis, and so have you.

428
00:30:19,354 --> 00:30:20,804
Look at this outfit.

429
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:22,705
You know, nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

430
00:30:22,706 --> 00:30:24,506
Let's have a drink while we're waiting.

431
00:30:25,307 --> 00:30:27,800
- No, thank you.
- What, on the wagon? Since when?

432
00:30:27,801 --> 00:30:32,001
Oh, yes. she doesn't drink anymore,
she won't smoke, and...

433
00:30:32,002 --> 00:30:36,102
Well, on the whole she's not much fun.

434
00:30:37,803 --> 00:30:40,803
- Shall we tell him?
- I think he's old enough, don't you?

435
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:43,654
I think yes.
If he doesn't hear it from loved ones,

436
00:30:43,665 --> 00:30:46,105
he'll hear it from nasty little
boys in the street.

437
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:49,006
We're going to have a baby.

438
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:52,807
I think we caught him off his guard
that time, didn't we?

439
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:57,408
Ever hear of anything so absurd in your life,
Jock and me being a papa and mama?

440
00:30:57,409 --> 00:31:01,309
Why, that's fine.
Just what you needed.

441
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:03,500
That's what we thought.

442
00:31:03,901 --> 00:31:07,001
Remember what we said about naming
the first one after you?

443
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:08,202
Well, it still goes.

444
00:31:08,203 --> 00:31:10,203
If it's a girl, I guess we'll have
to give you a rain check.

445
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:13,904
Don't worry, it'll be a boy. That's what
you want, and what you want you always get.

446
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,305
I know, if it's a girl, the drinks
are on you, if it's a boy, on John.

447
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:19,999
And if it's twins, on you, my friend.

448
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,100
They're on me what ever
it turns out to be.

449
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:24,101
I'll break a bottle of champagne
over it's head.

450
00:31:37,002 --> 00:31:38,902
You're pretty happy these days,
aren't you?

451
00:31:40,103 --> 00:31:41,403
Happy.

452
00:31:44,504 --> 00:31:49,004
- I've got him back, Bill.
- You never lost him, Mary.

453
00:31:50,105 --> 00:31:52,305
I almost did.

454
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:54,900
Now I know why.

455
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:58,201
I'd never waked up to being married.

456
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,800
Really married.

457
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:04,101
But I'm married now.

458
00:32:05,002 --> 00:32:06,202
And I love it.

459
00:32:06,903 --> 00:32:09,999
I don't know why everybody
in the world doesn't get married.

460
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,800
Including you.

461
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:19,501
- How about it, Bill?
- How about it what?

462
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:21,502
When are you going to settle down
and be respectable?

463
00:32:21,503 --> 00:32:23,603
Oh, some time. What's the rush?
I'm young yet.

464
00:32:23,604 --> 00:32:27,604
You're thirty-six. They tell me
a person crystalizes around that age.

465
00:32:27,605 --> 00:32:29,305
You know, gets habits.

466
00:32:29,306 --> 00:32:33,506
Dirty ashtrays, and laundry hampers
bother you.

467
00:32:33,507 --> 00:32:36,207
You don't like to hear people
whistle or...

468
00:32:36,228 --> 00:32:38,408
...to have to wait to get into
the bathroom.

469
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:45,009
We wonder about you a lot, Bill.

470
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:48,110
And wish you could discover
some nice, companiable girl...

471
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:50,311
...with charm and intelligence.

472
00:32:50,312 --> 00:32:52,312
And good ankles.

473
00:32:52,313 --> 00:32:53,903
That's the trouble with you
married couples.

474
00:32:53,904 --> 00:32:56,504
It's like somebody with
a contagious disease.

475
00:32:56,505 --> 00:32:59,105
You've got it, you see no reason
why anybody else shouldn't have it.

476
00:32:59,106 --> 00:33:01,206
Why don't they leave people alone?
Why do they have to go on...

477
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:04,307
Bill, you don't have to bite
my head off.

478
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:07,408
You can go to dickens, my fine
man about town.

479
00:33:10,409 --> 00:33:13,409
- I'm sorry.
- I hate you, Bill Hallam.

480
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,310
No, I don't.
I love you.

481
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:19,511
- But you're an awful fool, really.
- Maybe.

482
00:33:23,412 --> 00:33:25,999
- Here! Here, help yourself.
- What for?

483
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:28,213
Parade! Parade! Help me throw
these out the window.

484
00:33:29,014 --> 00:33:32,014
- Seems sort of senseless. However...
- Here, Bill.

485
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,215
Like that?

486
00:33:40,316 --> 00:33:43,800
Oh, no, no, no!
Like this, silly.

487
00:33:43,801 --> 00:33:47,201
- Why didn't you say so in the first place?
- Here.

488
00:34:23,402 --> 00:34:26,802
Poor Bill. Missing the finish.

489
00:34:27,503 --> 00:34:29,963
Wouldn't you know we have
to go out of town at this point?

490
00:34:29,999 --> 00:34:32,204
I told him I'd phone him
long-distance, dear.

491
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,505
I'm scared.

492
00:34:40,206 --> 00:34:42,606
Why, thousands of women are
going through the same thing...

493
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:44,807
...this very minute all over
the world.

494
00:34:44,808 --> 00:34:48,208
Chinese women, Arabians, Eskimos.

495
00:34:48,209 --> 00:34:50,309
I'll bet they aren't scared.

496
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,510
I'll bet they are.

497
00:34:53,711 --> 00:34:55,500
- Jock.
- Hm?

498
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:57,001
Promise me something?

499
00:34:57,002 --> 00:34:59,102
Anything, darling, anything at all.

500
00:35:00,003 --> 00:35:04,003
Promise me you'll tell me,
not a doctor or a nurse, if...

501
00:35:04,704 --> 00:35:07,404
...if it's a boy or a girl?

502
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:11,005
If it's ugly or misshapen.

503
00:35:11,406 --> 00:35:15,206
Or if it's... if it's perfectly beautiful.

504
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:17,407
As it's going to be, darling.

505
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,408
I want you to tell me.

506
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,809
Because...

507
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,910
Because I love you.

508
00:35:29,411 --> 00:35:31,711
What do you think he met,
Mr. Wallace?

509
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,812
- Who meant?
- President Coolidge.

510
00:35:33,813 --> 00:35:36,999
"I do not choose to run."

511
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,900
Don't you suppose he means
that if he does run?

512
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:41,701
Who can say?

513
00:35:52,102 --> 00:35:55,200
Ask Dr. Durand and Dr. Barton
to come up, please, right away.

514
00:35:56,201 --> 00:35:58,301
Oh, nurse. Nurse!

515
00:36:00,602 --> 00:36:03,602
Dr. Durand and Dr. Barton wanted
in Delivery Room A.

516
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,903
- Mary. Mary!
- Not now.

517
00:36:38,904 --> 00:36:40,004
Later.

518
00:36:55,575 --> 00:36:59,800
- Doctor, is she...
- Your wife's going to be all right.

519
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:01,901
They'll let you know
when you can see her.

520
00:37:16,002 --> 00:37:17,702
Just a moment, please.

521
00:37:23,103 --> 00:37:25,403
Mr. Wallace, there's a call for you.

522
00:37:32,304 --> 00:37:33,904
All right.

523
00:37:33,905 --> 00:37:35,705
You can take it in here.

524
00:37:47,906 --> 00:37:49,606
- Hello?
- Hello!

525
00:37:49,607 --> 00:37:51,807
Jock. Jock?

526
00:37:51,808 --> 00:37:53,508
How are things going?

527
00:37:53,509 --> 00:37:56,309
I said how are things going?
How's Mary?

528
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,010
What? I can't hear you.

529
00:38:01,511 --> 00:38:03,011
Oh.

530
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:05,562
Oh...

531
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:09,563
Jock. Jock!

532
00:38:11,064 --> 00:38:12,164
Jock!

533
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:21,165
You can see her now.

534
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:21,766
Hello.

535
00:39:23,067 --> 00:39:24,667
Hello, darling.

536
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:30,768
Mary.

537
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:46,869
Well?

538
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,070
Oh.

539
00:39:56,271 --> 00:39:58,271
I see.

540
00:40:00,472 --> 00:40:02,472
It's a girl.

541
00:40:06,473 --> 00:40:08,073
No.

542
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,374
No, it was a boy.

543
00:40:17,075 --> 00:40:19,775
A boy.

544
00:40:21,576 --> 00:40:23,376
I'm so glad.

545
00:40:34,007 --> 00:40:36,177
Was?

546
00:40:40,278 --> 00:40:42,300
You promised you'd tell me.

547
00:40:45,601 --> 00:40:47,401
It died.

548
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,902
Oh, darling.

549
00:40:58,203 --> 00:40:59,803
Darling.

550
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:16,804
I never even saw him.

551
00:41:22,405 --> 00:41:26,305
I never even knew what color
eyes he had.

552
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:28,500
Stop it!

553
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:30,601
Stop it, I...

554
00:41:35,402 --> 00:41:37,402
Oh, Mary.

555
00:41:37,403 --> 00:41:38,403
Mary.

556
00:41:58,304 --> 00:42:01,304
You still don't look so hot.
You ought to go away for a bit.

557
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:03,905
After all, six weeks in a hospital
must seem like a century.

558
00:42:03,906 --> 00:42:07,806
I am. I'm going to Bermuda
if they ever let me out of here.

559
00:42:07,807 --> 00:42:10,557
That'll be nice.
You and Jock both need it.

560
00:42:10,558 --> 00:42:12,258
Jock's not going.

561
00:42:13,459 --> 00:42:14,759
That's right.

562
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,360
Not going.

563
00:42:16,361 --> 00:42:19,861
- What, at a time like this he ought...
- You'd think so, wouldn't you?

564
00:42:19,862 --> 00:42:23,452
But you'd also think he'd find time
to visit me here now and then.

565
00:42:23,453 --> 00:42:25,153
And he doesn't.

566
00:42:25,754 --> 00:42:29,054
But he's coming up this afternoon.
The first time this week.

567
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:33,155
I suppose work's his way
of forgetting.

568
00:42:36,456 --> 00:42:39,700
He seems to feel that money's
the only thing...

569
00:42:39,701 --> 00:42:42,201
...you can be sure you've got
when you've got it.

570
00:42:43,502 --> 00:42:45,502
I can't say I blame him much.

571
00:42:46,803 --> 00:42:49,003
In fact, now that he's in the market,

572
00:42:49,004 --> 00:42:52,404
it looks as if we're going to be known
as those wealthy Wallaces.

573
00:42:53,205 --> 00:42:55,405
I sure thought you were pretty
well fixed already.

574
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,506
Oh, it's chicken feed, child's play.

575
00:42:58,507 --> 00:43:01,307
Jock's founding a financial dynasty.

576
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:05,108
Except that those dynasties
have to have...

577
00:43:19,009 --> 00:43:21,509
It wasn't my fault, was it?

578
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,910
No.

579
00:43:29,511 --> 00:43:31,211
You know in the movies,

580
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:36,212
How it's always the little lisping kiddy that
cements the papa and mama for keeps?

581
00:43:37,613 --> 00:43:40,913
Well, it's going to be an interesting
experiment with Jock and me.

582
00:43:40,914 --> 00:43:43,914
Because seems there won't be any kiddy.

583
00:43:44,515 --> 00:43:46,415
Not now and...

584
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:49,206
...maybe not later on.

585
00:43:54,707 --> 00:43:58,607
Everybody says that the movies
should be more like life.

586
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:03,208
I think...

587
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:05,609
life should be more like...

588
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:07,910
...the movies.

589
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:13,200
I guess that finishes everything,
doesn't it?

590
00:44:13,201 --> 00:44:15,001
Yes, except for your personal mail.

591
00:44:15,002 --> 00:44:16,702
Best wait till we get to New York.

592
00:44:17,503 --> 00:44:19,303
Probably old bills anyway...

593
00:44:43,304 --> 00:44:45,004
A hundred and two.
You think that's the top?

594
00:44:45,005 --> 00:44:46,805
With that stock we'll make a new hundred.

595
00:44:46,806 --> 00:44:48,406
This is barbaric.

596
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,107
Is, um... is this the quiet lunch?

597
00:45:14,108 --> 00:45:15,208
Isn't it a madhouse?

598
00:45:15,209 --> 00:45:17,509
What can I do? They just dropped in
and took the place over.

599
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:21,410
- How do you like the apartment?
- It's, um... very attractive.

600
00:45:21,611 --> 00:45:23,411
Do you really thnk so?

601
00:45:24,312 --> 00:45:26,712
I hate it. Going to have it done over.

602
00:45:26,713 --> 00:45:29,653
All metal this time.
Ought to be very uncomfortable.

603
00:45:29,654 --> 00:45:31,554
Then why have it done that way?

604
00:45:31,555 --> 00:45:33,605
Oh, I don't know. Novelty.

605
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:36,306
Somehow I can't see you in a chromium
setting, or Jock a either.

606
00:45:36,307 --> 00:45:39,600
Jock? It won't make any difference to him.
He's hardly ever here anyway.

607
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:41,901
As a matter of fact he hasn't
been home for three days.

608
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:44,502
Yes, I saw him at his office yesterday
just after my train got in.

609
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:47,403
You mean you actually managed
to penetrate into his presence?

610
00:45:47,404 --> 00:45:49,504
Congratulations. How is he?

611
00:45:49,505 --> 00:45:52,705
Has he grown a beard or anything?
Has he taken on weight?

612
00:45:52,706 --> 00:45:54,500
- What is this?
- What?

613
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,771
You and John.

614
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:58,672
Oh, darling, you've been away.
You're out of touch with things.

615
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:01,123
- Yeas, but are you...
- Are we getting along?

616
00:46:01,124 --> 00:46:04,124
Sure, we're happy as larks.
We can sing before breakfast.

617
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:07,025
Not to each other.

618
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:09,726
I hate to seem narrow dear,

619
00:46:09,797 --> 00:46:12,357
but don't you think your playmates
are getting a trifle rough?

620
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:16,628
Oh, Irene, this is Bill Hallan.
Bill, this is Irene Potter.

621
00:46:16,629 --> 00:46:17,629
How do you do?

622
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:21,130
Look, he's sober and he's civil.
What a curio.

623
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:23,231
You sure you've come
to the right place?

624
00:46:23,232 --> 00:46:24,232
Well, I don't know.

625
00:46:24,233 --> 00:46:26,033
Of course he has, and don't try
and fight him out of it either.

626
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:29,694
I wish you'd come earlier. Tony Goretta,
you know, the gangster was here.

627
00:46:29,695 --> 00:46:31,495
He had to rush off to a party, though.

628
00:46:31,496 --> 00:46:34,006
He's in such demand. You have
to book him weeks in advance.

629
00:46:34,007 --> 00:46:35,900
Um, what's the number here?

630
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:37,600
You'd think he'd know by now.

631
00:46:37,601 --> 00:46:41,100
In the past hour he's putting calls
to London, Paris and Madrid.

632
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:43,441
- Want a drink, Bill?
- I don't believe so, thanks.

633
00:46:43,442 --> 00:46:44,442
You'll have one, Irene.

634
00:46:44,443 --> 00:46:46,443
Oh, not me, I'll have to be getting
back to the store.

635
00:46:46,444 --> 00:46:48,944
After all, I'm a decent,
God-fearing businesswoman...

636
00:46:48,945 --> 00:46:51,745
- ...and there are only a few of us left.
- Telephone for you, Miss Potter.

637
00:46:52,246 --> 00:46:54,046
What'll they think of next.

638
00:46:59,047 --> 00:47:01,447
This is the voice of experience speaking.

639
00:47:01,448 --> 00:47:04,148
Irene had a candy shop over
on Madison Avenue.

640
00:47:04,149 --> 00:47:06,149
In fact, I'm sort of a silent partner.

641
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,250
I give her a dollar and she
gives me back two.

642
00:47:08,251 --> 00:47:09,951
It's unbelievable.

643
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:22,752
Wang Tee, did you say?

644
00:47:22,753 --> 00:47:25,700
How marvelous!
With or without a chaperone?

645
00:47:25,701 --> 00:47:29,301
Oh, with, of course, my dear.
Trust her. Her own crowd's going.

646
00:47:29,302 --> 00:47:31,502
But after all, it is Freddy's bill,
you know.

647
00:47:31,503 --> 00:47:33,603
Oh, so it's Benny Huston now, is it?

648
00:47:33,604 --> 00:47:35,474
What became of Walt Holden, by the way?

649
00:47:35,475 --> 00:47:39,405
Oh, he went to the discard ages ago.
At least six weeks.

650
00:47:39,476 --> 00:47:41,776
A platonic friendship's cheaper.

651
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:46,277
A platonic...

652
00:47:47,378 --> 00:47:48,778
Platonic!

653
00:47:55,478 --> 00:47:58,278
- Where is Mrs. Wallace?
- Who is she?

654
00:47:58,279 --> 00:47:59,579
Oh, never mind.

655
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,680
Oh, Max, you must contain yourself.

656
00:48:07,681 --> 00:48:09,281
Hello, darling, having a good time?

657
00:48:09,282 --> 00:48:11,002
- Have you met Mr...
- I want to talk to you.

658
00:48:11,603 --> 00:48:12,803
Bill!

659
00:48:12,804 --> 00:48:15,204
Now look here, old man, you can't...

660
00:48:18,505 --> 00:48:20,205
Bill! Bill!

661
00:48:20,206 --> 00:48:22,106
My wrist!

662
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,300
- Get out!
- Stay where you are, Jean!

663
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,801
I said get out!

664
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:33,302
Now!

665
00:48:33,303 --> 00:48:36,500
Now indeed. Is there any reason
for this melodrama? Really, Bill!

666
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:38,341
Mary, what's happened to you?

667
00:48:38,342 --> 00:48:40,942
I haven't the slightest idea
what you're talking about.

668
00:48:41,243 --> 00:48:43,500
Let me go, Bill. I have my friends.

669
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:46,101
Your friends. Do you realize what
those people out there are saying about you?

670
00:48:46,102 --> 00:48:48,202
They're my guests, Bill. I don't care
to hear anything about...

671
00:48:48,203 --> 00:48:49,603
You'll hear what I tell you!

672
00:48:49,604 --> 00:48:51,604
If you haven't sense enough
to care for your own reputation.

673
00:48:51,605 --> 00:48:54,505
Reputation? Oh, darling.

674
00:48:55,706 --> 00:48:59,006
Nobody has a reputation these days,
it isn't done.

675
00:48:59,007 --> 00:49:01,107
Well, you won't have one if you
go to Wang Tee, that's certain.

676
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:03,608
And I'm going to tell Jock you can't go
and why you can't go.

677
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:06,509
My dear, Jock isn't even aware
that I'm planning on going.

678
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:09,310
- He isn't aware?
- How could he be?

679
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:11,911
I told you he hasn't been home
for three days.

680
00:49:12,812 --> 00:49:14,612
Well, he'll be aware now.

681
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:17,800
All right, call him,
hear what he says.

682
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:19,801
Digby 44999.

683
00:49:20,202 --> 00:49:22,802
Jock doesn't care what I do,
don't you understand?

684
00:49:22,803 --> 00:49:24,903
He has more important things
to worry about.

685
00:49:24,904 --> 00:49:27,404
His precious Casino Club, the market.

686
00:49:27,405 --> 00:49:29,205
Those are the things nearest
his heart.

687
00:49:29,206 --> 00:49:31,806
Digby 44999.

688
00:49:31,807 --> 00:49:33,507
There must be someone there,
operator.

689
00:49:33,508 --> 00:49:35,408
Oh, you're a fool, Bill.

690
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:37,409
You're such a fool!

691
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:38,999
Wait, Jock, what's the matter?

692
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,100
There he is now. Must have dropped in
to get a toothbrush or something.

693
00:49:44,001 --> 00:49:47,001
Jock, dear, I know it'll really
bore you, but...

694
00:49:47,002 --> 00:49:48,302
Bill thinks you'd like to know...

695
00:49:51,603 --> 00:49:53,103
Jock.

696
00:49:56,504 --> 00:49:58,404
Jock, what's wrong?

697
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:00,905
Wrong?

698
00:50:01,906 --> 00:50:03,306
I don't know.

699
00:50:03,807 --> 00:50:05,307
It couldn't have happened.

700
00:50:06,408 --> 00:50:08,798
It couldn't. Not overnight, anyway.

701
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:10,299
What couldn't?

702
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,999
Wiped out.

703
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,600
Could you get me...
Could you get me a drink, Mary?

704
00:50:18,901 --> 00:50:20,501
I think I need...

705
00:51:46,302 --> 00:51:48,302
The Empress Eugénie, eh?

706
00:51:49,403 --> 00:51:53,503
She must have had a lot of self-confidence
if she went around wearing these things.

707
00:51:56,304 --> 00:52:00,404
I don't know. Somehow it looks
different on me.

708
00:52:00,405 --> 00:52:03,005
You'll grow into it

709
00:52:03,006 --> 00:52:05,406
I wish the hobble skirt had come
back in again.

710
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:08,907
Anyway, it was something a girl
could get her teeth into.

711
00:52:09,808 --> 00:52:11,208
Bill!

712
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:13,009
You sure you can't stay for dinner?

713
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,710
Sorry, Mary, I'd like to,
but I have to get back to town.

714
00:52:16,311 --> 00:52:17,661
Listen, Mary.

715
00:52:17,982 --> 00:52:19,802
I'm asking you for the last time.

716
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:23,003
Why don't you come out and work
at the store? Why let Jock keep you from it?

717
00:52:23,004 --> 00:52:26,304
- Where's your self-respect?
- I can't do it, Irene.

718
00:52:26,305 --> 00:52:29,005
My self-respect isn't as important
right now as his is.

719
00:52:29,006 --> 00:52:32,206
If he had any self-respect, do you think
he'd keep on drinking the way he does?

720
00:52:33,307 --> 00:52:35,107
I don't see how you stand it.

721
00:52:35,108 --> 00:52:36,308
I couldn't.

722
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:39,309
And I certainly couldn't stand
living on borrowed money.

723
00:52:39,310 --> 00:52:41,510
- Borrowed money?
- You heard me.

724
00:52:45,211 --> 00:52:47,600
All right, all right, I got caught,
what of it?

725
00:52:47,601 --> 00:52:51,301
- Business is still fundamentally sound.
- And you're fundamentally stupid.

726
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:54,302
I won't allow my wife to work.

727
00:52:54,303 --> 00:52:56,703
A woman's place is in the home.

728
00:52:56,704 --> 00:53:00,004
That sort of thing went out with buttoned
shoes and hand-painted china.

729
00:53:00,005 --> 00:53:03,305
Oh, never mind, never mind, Irene,
I know your views, you know mine.

730
00:53:03,306 --> 00:53:06,806
Well, someone in this house ought to have
a job and since Mary wants to work...

731
00:53:06,807 --> 00:53:08,557
Well, she's not going to
and that's that.

732
00:53:08,558 --> 00:53:12,158
I don't know, Jock, a salary's a salary
especially in these times.

733
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,459
Oh, these times. There's nothing
the matter with these times.

734
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,260
Prosperity's just around the corner.

735
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,361
Same corner you said it was
around last year?

736
00:53:20,362 --> 00:53:23,062
The poor thing must be crawling
on its hands and knees.

737
00:53:24,963 --> 00:53:28,663
Which end of the asparagus do you cut off,
the top or the bottom?

738
00:53:29,564 --> 00:53:32,964
Neither. You take out the middle
and knit the ends together.

739
00:53:35,165 --> 00:53:38,565
I had a feeling I'd be cooking
this dinner sooner or later.

740
00:53:38,566 --> 00:53:40,866
I guess I'm not cut out for the home.

741
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:45,367
In heaven's name! What's the matter
with this country?

742
00:53:45,368 --> 00:53:47,268
Nothing's happening.
Everything's dead.

743
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:51,469
I'm equipped to do things.
I know I can do them, but...

744
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,900
I can't even get a chance.

745
00:53:56,001 --> 00:53:57,201
Read that.

746
00:53:57,202 --> 00:54:00,202
That's the profession I was
trained for. Architecture.

747
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:02,303
I'm trying to get back in the firm now.
Anything, I don't care.

748
00:54:02,304 --> 00:54:04,700
Even a draftsman's job.
What do they tell me?

749
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:07,459
"We regret exceedingly, that under
the present conditions...

750
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,260
...there is no opening available."

751
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,400
We regret exceedingly.

752
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:18,101
I spend four years in college learning
the things the firm expects of me.

753
00:54:18,102 --> 00:54:20,802
I work for them six solid years and...

754
00:54:20,803 --> 00:54:23,703
Now they regret exceedingly.

755
00:54:24,304 --> 00:54:26,904
You know I'll carry you as long
as you want, Jock, but...

756
00:54:26,999 --> 00:54:29,505
Now, this is for your own good.

757
00:54:30,106 --> 00:54:33,206
Why don't you take any sort of job?
There must be something you can do.

758
00:54:33,207 --> 00:54:36,107
Sure. Clerking for twenty a week.

759
00:55:00,308 --> 00:55:03,308
Well, um... I guess I'll be going along.

760
00:55:04,209 --> 00:55:05,709
Goodbye, Irene.

761
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,410
Well, if you had any manners,
you'd stay and face the music.

762
00:55:12,211 --> 00:55:14,201
- Bye, Bill.
- Sorry I have to rush off.

763
00:55:17,002 --> 00:55:19,202
So that's how we've been living.

764
00:55:19,203 --> 00:55:21,903
He, um... gave me some money once.

765
00:55:23,304 --> 00:55:25,204
You liar.

766
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,505
You sweet liar.

767
00:55:27,506 --> 00:55:30,806
No, no, really.
He gave it to me to keep for him.

768
00:55:30,807 --> 00:55:34,707
You'd better stop.
You'd better stop or I'll start crying.

769
00:55:35,908 --> 00:55:37,808
I wouldn't want to do that.

770
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:40,309
Is he like this often?

771
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:46,510
Bill, what am I going to do?

772
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:51,511
What do wives do, put something
in the coffee or what?

773
00:55:52,212 --> 00:55:53,612
Let me talk to him.

774
00:55:53,613 --> 00:55:56,213
Talk doesn't do any good,
I've tried that.

775
00:55:56,214 --> 00:56:00,704
It might. At least what I have
to say to him might.

776
00:56:08,005 --> 00:56:09,805
- Irene.
- Yes?

777
00:56:09,806 --> 00:56:12,206
I've decided to take that job
at the candy shop.

778
00:56:12,207 --> 00:56:15,200
Oh, honey, that's simply grand.
We'll make a fortune.

779
00:56:15,201 --> 00:56:18,101
You know how I feel about you working.
Why do you have to bring it up now?

780
00:56:18,102 --> 00:56:20,602
- Why do you have...
- This is why.

781
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:41,503
Oh. I thought you'd gone.

782
00:56:44,704 --> 00:56:46,604
What's the matter with you?

783
00:56:46,605 --> 00:56:50,905
- What do you mean?
- You're a fine-looking specimen.

784
00:56:52,406 --> 00:56:54,306
Is that why you came back,
to give me a sermon?

785
00:56:54,307 --> 00:56:57,307
- I'll give you more than that.
- Oh, yeah?

786
00:56:58,608 --> 00:56:59,999
Look at yourself!

787
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,600
Pretty, isn't it?

788
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:04,101
I don't blame you for not
wanting to see it.

789
00:57:04,102 --> 00:57:06,602
You might consider the people
around you, though. They have to see it.

790
00:57:06,603 --> 00:57:09,703
Oh... try it.

791
00:57:09,704 --> 00:57:13,204
How long are you going to keep this up?
Who do you think you are?

792
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:15,405
Leave me alone, Bill, I don't want
to hear any more out of you.

793
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:17,106
You're going to, though.

794
00:57:17,107 --> 00:57:19,207
You're licked and you've quit.

795
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:23,800
- You've got a streak of yellow so wide...
- I think you'd better shut up.

796
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:26,401
I've kept you going for months.

797
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:29,202
And now that Mary's got a job,
I suppose you'll live off her.

798
00:57:29,203 --> 00:57:32,503
Did anyone ever tell you what they call
a man who lets his wife support him?

799
00:57:33,304 --> 00:57:35,604
I said I think you'd better shut up.

800
00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:37,805
It's a short word and an ugly one.

801
00:57:37,806 --> 00:57:39,506
But here's where you get it.

802
00:57:43,707 --> 00:57:45,507
I'm sorry, Bill.

803
00:57:48,708 --> 00:57:50,908
That's all right, Jock.

804
00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:05,909
I'm sorry, madam, but all sales are final.

805
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,110
Young man, don't stand there
and talk back to me!

806
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:10,311
Where's the manager?
Manager!

807
00:58:10,312 --> 00:58:13,212
Mr. Wallace. Your wife is on the phone.

808
00:58:13,213 --> 00:58:14,813
Tell her I'll call her back.
I can't take it now.

809
00:58:14,814 --> 00:58:17,814
Oh, sure you can. I'll handle
the animals for you.

810
00:58:17,815 --> 00:58:19,115
All right, thank you.

811
00:58:19,116 --> 00:58:23,400
- Did you wish something, madam?
- It's alright, I'm fine.

812
00:58:23,401 --> 00:58:26,401
- Hello.
- I'm sorry to bother you, dear.

813
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:30,602
But, could you please get a star
for the top of the tree?

814
00:58:30,603 --> 00:58:34,103
You know, one of those big, gilt,
shiny things?

815
00:58:34,999 --> 00:58:37,604
Say, look. Did the cook get there?

816
00:58:38,005 --> 00:58:39,905
Yes, she's here.

817
00:58:40,206 --> 00:58:44,206
Ooh. It doesn't sound so hot,
but she's here.

818
00:58:45,407 --> 00:58:47,007
When do you think you'll get away?

819
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:52,208
All right, darling. We'll expect you
when you get here.

820
00:58:53,309 --> 00:58:54,509
Goodbye, dear.

821
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:02,010
Silent night, Silent night...

822
00:59:02,011 --> 00:59:06,711
La-la-la-la-la-la-la.

823
00:59:11,712 --> 00:59:13,412
I was afraid of that.

824
00:59:14,313 --> 00:59:16,313
Merry Christmas from
Bloomfield's Incorporated.

825
00:59:16,454 --> 00:59:18,814
Merry Christmas from
Bloomfield's Incorporated.

826
00:59:18,995 --> 00:59:21,500
Merry Christmas from
Bloomfield's Incorporated.

827
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:23,201
Same to Bloomfield's, I'm sure.

828
01:00:15,006 --> 01:00:17,116
- Yes?
- I hate to bother you, Mr. Wakefield.

829
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:19,100
I know it's Christmas and you're
in a hurry to get home, but...

830
01:00:19,101 --> 01:00:20,561
I'd like to speak to you
for a moment, please.

831
01:00:20,562 --> 01:00:22,162
- What is it?
- I'm a salesman in the basement.

832
01:00:22,163 --> 01:00:24,563
At the sweater counter.
I just got my paycheck and...

833
01:00:24,564 --> 01:00:25,964
They gave me this.

834
01:00:25,965 --> 01:00:28,365
I'm very sorry. There's nothing
1I can do about it.

835
01:00:28,366 --> 01:00:29,996
I just wanted to explain that if you...

836
01:00:29,997 --> 01:00:31,577
If you send your application in
after the holidays,

837
01:00:31,578 --> 01:00:34,008
- I'll be glad to keep you in mind.
- You must listen to me, Mr. Wakefield.

838
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:36,109
I've been here for ten weeks
and I've worked hard.

839
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,310
- I'm sure.
- May I wasn't so good when I first started,

840
01:00:38,311 --> 01:00:39,999
but I'm all right now
and I'm getting better.

841
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,250
I don't think you realize that
there's nothing I can do about it.

842
01:00:42,251 --> 01:00:44,781
- You see, with me it isn't...
- Sales are low after Christmas.

843
01:00:44,782 --> 01:00:47,892
- We've got to cut down somewhere.
- It isn't the money, Mr. Wakefield.

844
01:00:47,893 --> 01:00:50,093
- It's... it's the job.
- I understand, yes.

845
01:00:50,094 --> 01:00:52,654
When I came here ten weeks ago
I hadn't worked for so long that...

846
01:00:52,655 --> 01:00:54,999
...I'd lost the respect of everybody.

847
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Even...

848
01:00:56,001 --> 01:01:00,601
You can't let me go now, you can't.
If you do, it means that I've failed again.

849
01:01:00,602 --> 01:01:03,702
I can't go home like this.
Please, I'll do anything.

850
01:01:03,703 --> 01:01:05,903
I'll work for what ever you say,
or what ever you'll want to give me.

851
01:01:05,904 --> 01:01:07,804
But I've got to have the job.

852
01:01:07,805 --> 01:01:09,700
I'd be glad to help if I could.

853
01:01:09,701 --> 01:01:13,001
But after all you must realize there are
hundreds of people in the same position.

854
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:16,402
If I made an exception in one case, I'd
have to make it all the way down the line.

855
01:01:16,403 --> 01:01:18,803
It's too bad, but that's how it is.

856
01:01:18,804 --> 01:01:21,104
Here. Merry Christmas.

857
01:01:35,605 --> 01:01:37,805
Anything wrong, Mr. Wallace?

858
01:01:37,956 --> 01:01:40,106
I say, is there anything wrong?

859
01:01:40,107 --> 01:01:44,407
- Anything I can do?
- Oh, no... No, no. No, thanks.

860
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:47,708
Well, Merry Christmas...

861
01:01:47,709 --> 01:01:51,309
- ...from Bloomfield's Incorporated.
- Thanks. Same to you.

862
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:52,510
It... it isn't very warm, is it?

863
01:02:52,511 --> 01:02:55,011
Why, mine's swell.

864
01:02:55,012 --> 01:02:58,312
Mine's hardly that, but it certainly
fills the void.

865
01:03:12,313 --> 01:03:13,913
Yes, sir, Mr. Wallace.

866
01:03:13,914 --> 01:03:16,314
If you ask me, them were
the days, too.

867
01:03:16,315 --> 01:03:18,515
Like a gentleman's club
this place was then.

868
01:03:18,516 --> 01:03:20,916
Nice and quiet, and genteel.

869
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:25,117
Now look. We have to serve all the riffraff
that comes in off the street.

870
01:03:25,918 --> 01:03:30,008
Repeal. Well, so they can have the repeal
if that's the way it works.

871
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:34,519
Turning a nice, refined place like this
into a... a regular saloon.

872
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:47,220
Merry Christmas, Kitty!

873
01:03:47,221 --> 01:03:48,999
To you maybe.

874
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,300
Well, stranger.

875
01:04:05,001 --> 01:04:08,401
Well, for the love of...
Say...

876
01:04:08,402 --> 01:04:10,802
Go on, pull up a chair, sit down.
How've you been, Kitty?

877
01:04:10,803 --> 01:04:12,803
- Fine, and you?
- Oh, never better.

878
01:04:12,804 --> 01:04:15,004
Say, Charlie...
You with anybody?

879
01:04:15,005 --> 01:04:18,005
No, I had a date, but, um...

880
01:04:18,006 --> 01:04:20,500
That's swell. Charlie,
scotch and soda for the lady.

881
01:04:20,501 --> 01:04:21,601
Make it two.

882
01:04:21,602 --> 01:04:24,452
- You out on parole or something?
- Parole? What...

883
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,603
Now, now, come, come,
Christmas Eve, darling.

884
01:04:26,604 --> 01:04:29,800
You know, up at home
and cackling in the kitchen?

885
01:04:29,801 --> 01:04:31,601
Shouldn't you be playing Santa Claus?

886
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:33,202
Seems to me I remember
hearing a rumor...

887
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:36,103
...about the patter of tiny feet
heading your way.

888
01:04:39,904 --> 01:04:41,504
Uh...

889
01:04:42,405 --> 01:04:44,105
They detoured.

890
01:04:46,506 --> 01:04:49,106
Well, happy days.

891
01:04:49,107 --> 01:04:52,007
Peace on earth, goodwill and...
so forth.

892
01:04:55,608 --> 01:04:57,708
A Merry Christmas.

893
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:01,509
A Merry, Merry Christmas.

894
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:06,000
Bill, have you no home?

895
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:07,701
I'm staying till he comes.

896
01:05:09,602 --> 01:05:10,802
All right.

897
01:05:11,603 --> 01:05:14,503
But I warn you, he's not a pretty sight
when he gets like this.

898
01:05:14,504 --> 01:05:17,104
I'm going to bed.

899
01:05:17,605 --> 01:05:21,705
Oh, um... Would you like to try
the davenport? I'll fix it for you.

900
01:06:55,606 --> 01:06:57,606
May I have one too?

901
01:07:07,007 --> 01:07:10,607
Seems to be my night for insomnia
among other things.

902
01:07:24,508 --> 01:07:26,108
Isn't it funny?

903
01:07:27,109 --> 01:07:30,009
All evening I've been hoping
he'd come home...

904
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:32,110
Now I dread it.

905
01:07:32,111 --> 01:07:33,311
Dread it?

906
01:07:34,412 --> 01:07:37,712
Because I've been through it
so many times before.

907
01:07:41,113 --> 01:07:46,613
Bill, what happens when people reach
the point where they can't go on?

908
01:07:46,614 --> 01:07:49,404
They just do go on, somehow,
if they can.

909
01:07:49,405 --> 01:07:51,005
I can't.

910
01:07:52,206 --> 01:07:54,006
Not any more.

911
01:07:54,007 --> 01:07:56,007
Oh, Bill, I'm frightened.

912
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:01,108
We're like two swimmers trying
to reach the shore, he and I.

913
01:08:01,109 --> 01:08:05,109
We're both worn out, but he's limp
and doesn't struggle any more.

914
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:07,110
And I try to hold him up,

915
01:08:07,111 --> 01:08:11,511
and instead of coming nearer,
the shore gets farther and farther away.

916
01:08:11,512 --> 01:08:13,712
He's going down, Bill.

917
01:08:13,713 --> 01:08:15,713
He's gone down.

918
01:08:15,714 --> 01:08:17,999
And I don't know what to do.

919
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,200
Oh, my dear.
Do you think I haven't seen it?

920
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:23,701
Do you think I haven't wanted
to do something about it?

921
01:08:23,702 --> 01:08:25,352
To help you.

922
01:08:25,353 --> 01:08:27,999
You should have someone to care
for you, and cherish you.

923
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:30,163
I've wanted to do that. Always.

924
01:08:30,164 --> 01:08:31,864
Even before you were married.

925
01:08:31,865 --> 01:08:34,565
I've always wanted to tell you
what you mean to me.

926
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:36,806
The clothes you wear,
the way you wear them.

927
01:08:36,807 --> 01:08:40,607
The way you walk, and talk,
and stand, and sit.

928
01:08:40,608 --> 01:08:43,308
The funny way you drum
on my shoulder when we dance.

929
01:08:43,309 --> 01:08:45,309
The way you used to laugh.

930
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:46,800
Because you don't laugh any more.

931
01:08:46,801 --> 01:08:49,001
I've watched your eyes
when you were hurt...

932
01:08:49,002 --> 01:08:52,402
...and listened to your voice saying the
things you wanted to believe yet couldn't.

933
01:08:52,403 --> 01:08:56,500
I can't... I can't watch or listen
any longer.

934
01:08:56,501 --> 01:09:00,201
Oh, Mary. I love you so.

935
01:09:06,602 --> 01:09:08,402
You knew it, didn't you?

936
01:09:09,903 --> 01:09:13,203
I... I suppose I've always known.

937
01:09:14,904 --> 01:09:16,104
But...

938
01:09:17,105 --> 01:09:22,105
Bill, I'm fonder of you than
anyone else on earth.

939
01:09:23,206 --> 01:09:26,606
I don't know whether it's liking or love.

940
01:09:26,607 --> 01:09:30,407
Or if it's love, what kind of love it is.

941
01:09:31,408 --> 01:09:34,508
Anyway, it's a lot. But...

942
01:09:34,509 --> 01:09:37,509
It isn't the same thing that
I feel for Jock.

943
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:40,710
That you feel now,
or that you used to feel?

944
01:09:40,711 --> 01:09:43,011
That I've always felt.

945
01:09:44,012 --> 01:09:46,112
That I'll have to get over.

946
01:09:46,113 --> 01:09:48,513
Because it's doing him no good.

947
01:09:48,514 --> 01:09:52,614
- And it's making me...
- I've waited a long time.

948
01:09:52,615 --> 01:09:54,415
I can go on waiting.

949
01:09:54,416 --> 01:09:56,316
Until you're ready.

950
01:10:09,917 --> 01:10:11,417
Will you go?

951
01:10:21,018 --> 01:10:24,218
Hey, Buddy. Is there a guy named
John Wallace lives here?

952
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:26,119
- Yes.
- Well, there's been a accident and...

953
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,700
- What?
- A accident.

954
01:10:27,701 --> 01:10:29,901
My cab crashed into
the one he was in.

955
01:10:29,902 --> 01:10:32,602
I took him to the hospital
and I thought maybe you'd want to go.

956
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:33,900
How badly is he hurt?

957
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:35,901
- He isn't dead?
- No.

958
01:10:35,902 --> 01:10:38,702
Wasn't when I left him anyways.
But he's pretty bad.

959
01:10:40,203 --> 01:10:41,703
Wait a minute.

960
01:10:44,504 --> 01:10:46,404
Mary.

961
01:10:47,405 --> 01:10:49,505
Take me to him, Bill.

962
01:10:57,106 --> 01:10:59,406
I'm afraid you can stay only a minute.

963
01:11:25,107 --> 01:11:26,407
Mary.

964
01:11:29,008 --> 01:11:32,108
You must get well, darling.

965
01:11:34,609 --> 01:11:36,709
You're going to get well.

966
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:54,300
Oh, Bill.

967
01:11:55,901 --> 01:11:57,801
He's got to live.

968
01:11:57,802 --> 01:12:00,802
He'll live. He's got everything
to live for.

969
01:12:05,803 --> 01:12:08,203
Would you like to see
the young lady now?

970
01:12:12,404 --> 01:12:14,604
She got off easier than the gentleman.

971
01:12:19,005 --> 01:12:20,805
Maybe you'd better not go in now.

972
01:12:20,806 --> 01:12:23,306
But I thought you'd like to know
she's resting comfortably.

973
01:13:05,907 --> 01:13:07,597
We'll have a party at opening night...

974
01:13:07,598 --> 01:13:09,700
...for all the people that stuck by me
when I needed them.

975
01:13:09,701 --> 01:13:12,101
Bill, and Irene...

976
01:13:14,402 --> 01:13:16,402
You've been so swell, darling.

977
01:13:16,403 --> 01:13:19,103
That's all I've thought about
all the months that I've been lying here.

978
01:13:19,904 --> 01:13:22,704
How I'll ever be able
to make up to you...

979
01:13:22,705 --> 01:13:25,605
I know what you had to go through
and what you're still having to go through.

980
01:13:26,706 --> 01:13:28,306
What's the matter, honey?

981
01:13:28,307 --> 01:13:29,507
Nothing.

982
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:34,308
Um...

983
01:13:35,209 --> 01:13:36,409
Jock.

984
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:40,210
You haven't anything you want
to tell me, have you?

985
01:13:40,711 --> 01:13:42,811
Tell you? About what?

986
01:13:44,212 --> 01:13:46,812
Oh... about...

987
01:13:46,999 --> 01:13:49,013
About us.

988
01:13:49,014 --> 01:13:50,314
You and me.

989
01:13:51,415 --> 01:13:55,715
Oh, nothing, except that I'm ashamed
of what I've been and...

990
01:13:56,116 --> 01:13:57,516
But we're set now, and...

991
01:13:57,517 --> 01:14:00,117
...together we can lick the whole world
permanently this time.

992
01:14:01,318 --> 01:14:02,718
Is that all?

993
01:14:03,419 --> 01:14:05,019
And that I love you.

994
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:11,300
You're tired, aren't you, dear?

995
01:14:15,101 --> 01:14:17,501
Just wait till I get the casino open.

996
01:14:17,502 --> 01:14:20,202
I can take care of myself after that.

997
01:14:22,103 --> 01:14:23,503
Yes.

998
01:14:23,504 --> 01:14:26,704
After that you can take care of yourself.

999
01:14:30,505 --> 01:14:32,105
This is what I was going to say.

1000
01:14:32,106 --> 01:14:34,906
Reopening the club has been
merely part of my job.

1001
01:14:34,907 --> 01:14:37,507
I've been laying plans for its expansion.

1002
01:14:37,508 --> 01:14:40,508
Now, as some of you may know,
I started this project.

1003
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:44,500
And subject of course to our
distinguished board of governors,

1004
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:48,101
I should like to see it continue on the same
scale in which it was begun.

1005
01:14:48,102 --> 01:14:50,302
In fact, I see an even bigger casino.

1006
01:14:50,303 --> 01:14:53,903
I see a larger, more magnificent
venture.

1007
01:14:53,904 --> 01:14:57,404
We need more space, more gardens,
more grounds.

1008
01:14:57,405 --> 01:14:59,105
You should be feeling pretty
happy tonight.

1009
01:14:59,406 --> 01:15:02,706
- I suppose I should, shouldn't I?
- Well, aren't you?

1010
01:15:02,807 --> 01:15:06,007
Has Jock told you about
the new job that's been offered him?

1011
01:15:06,008 --> 01:15:07,308
Job, what job?

1012
01:15:07,809 --> 01:15:09,999
With the firm of architects
he used to be with.

1013
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,500
When did this come up?

1014
01:15:11,501 --> 01:15:13,401
A couple of days ago.

1015
01:15:13,402 --> 01:15:17,402
They've got a contract for the construction
of a model community in the Tennessee Valley.

1016
01:15:17,403 --> 01:15:19,603
It's a part of the new housing program.

1017
01:15:19,604 --> 01:15:21,704
They want him to go down
and take it over.

1018
01:15:21,705 --> 01:15:23,705
You know, gauge the needs
of the people,

1019
01:15:23,706 --> 01:15:26,406
and then design a whole little town...

1020
01:15:26,407 --> 01:15:29,300
...to fit their requirements and
geographical background.

1021
01:15:29,301 --> 01:15:31,001
Tennessee Valley, hm?

1022
01:15:31,002 --> 01:15:33,302
Sort of primitive down there, isn't it?

1023
01:15:34,703 --> 01:15:36,803
Yes, I suppose it is.

1024
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:41,804
I don't know, though. Going a little
primitive might not be a bad idea.

1025
01:15:41,905 --> 01:15:44,900
It's something rather vitalizing.

1026
01:15:45,801 --> 01:15:49,001
Yes, even inspiring about
a project of that kind.

1027
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:51,902
I know. Big and clean,
the washing-an-elephant idea.

1028
01:15:52,303 --> 01:15:54,703
It is easy to laugh at, isn't it?

1029
01:15:55,604 --> 01:15:57,204
But somehow...

1030
01:16:06,605 --> 01:16:08,900
You'd think they're ushering in
the millenium tonight,

1031
01:16:08,901 --> 01:16:11,601
instead of just trying to pull
a bad investment out of the red.

1032
01:16:11,602 --> 01:16:15,002
About the only thing they overlooked
is to let loose a flock of doves.

1033
01:16:15,703 --> 01:16:19,603
Ah, here he is now.
Personal magnetism himself.

1034
01:16:20,004 --> 01:16:22,980
Well, what comes next, chorus girls
on white horses or what?

1035
01:16:22,981 --> 01:16:23,981
Aren't you ever satisfied?

1036
01:16:23,982 --> 01:16:26,182
Here, I think you two deserve
this more than I do.

1037
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:28,223
Better see if it's paid for first.

1038
01:16:28,244 --> 01:16:31,084
- How did you think it went off, darling?
- Oh, splendidly.

1039
01:16:31,085 --> 01:16:34,485
- I hear you've been offered a new job.
- Yeah, some job that is.

1040
01:16:34,486 --> 01:16:36,986
- Why, are you turning it down?
- What do you think?

1041
01:16:36,987 --> 01:16:38,800
Oh, darling, you know
what the board just told me?

1042
01:16:38,801 --> 01:16:41,101
They say that if everything
goes along satisfactorily,

1043
01:16:41,102 --> 01:16:43,302
there's no reason I shouldn't
be getting a cut on the profits.

1044
01:16:43,303 --> 01:16:45,003
In addition to my salary.

1045
01:16:45,004 --> 01:16:47,404
Oh, that's fine, Jock.

1046
01:16:47,405 --> 01:16:50,205
It's simply one more step on
the road back, that's what it is.

1047
01:16:50,206 --> 01:16:53,006
From managership, to partnership,
to majority control.

1048
01:16:53,007 --> 01:16:56,207
# It's most true dear #
# What the projections tell thee #

1049
01:16:56,208 --> 01:16:58,888
# The daring young man #
# On the flying trapeze #

1050
01:16:58,889 --> 01:17:00,789
That's all right, you just wait and see.

1051
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:02,900
It's back to a penthouse for us,
darling, before you know it.

1052
01:17:02,901 --> 01:17:05,800
Won't that seem good?
Remember that mink you had to sell?

1053
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:08,000
We'll replace it with sables this time.
How'll that be?

1054
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,500
Oh, Josh! Hello, Bill!

1055
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,790
An admirer of yours wants to meet you.
Mr. Craig, Mr. Wallace.

1056
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:14,900
- How do you do?
- I liked your speech, Mr. Wallace.

1057
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:16,201
- It was very convincing.
- Oh, thank you.

1058
01:17:16,202 --> 01:17:17,802
Wonderful place you have here.

1059
01:17:17,803 --> 01:17:20,403
See you later, dear.

1060
01:17:24,004 --> 01:17:28,004
Bill, are you going to be
terribly busy tomorrow?

1061
01:17:28,005 --> 01:17:30,905
Never too busy to see a charming,
young, etc...

1062
01:17:31,806 --> 01:17:33,806
I'd like to have a talk with you.

1063
01:17:33,807 --> 01:17:35,807
What about lunch, say the Plaza.

1064
01:17:35,808 --> 01:17:39,808
No, this isn't social.
It's business.

1065
01:17:42,209 --> 01:17:44,109
I'll come to your office.

1066
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:01,110
Well, what's on your mind?
Things going all right at the store?

1067
01:18:01,111 --> 01:18:02,200
Booming.

1068
01:18:02,201 --> 01:18:06,001
A chain store's going to buy us out and
they want me to stay on and act as manager.

1069
01:18:06,002 --> 01:18:08,402
At a good salary.
A really good salary.

1070
01:18:08,403 --> 01:18:10,303
Well, you've worked hard
enough for it, Mary.

1071
01:18:10,304 --> 01:18:11,904
Want me to draw up a contract?

1072
01:18:13,005 --> 01:18:14,405
Is that it?

1073
01:18:15,106 --> 01:18:18,406
No... that's not it.

1074
01:18:23,207 --> 01:18:27,807
Bill, you were in on the beginning,
so you might as well be in on the finish.

1075
01:18:30,808 --> 01:18:32,508
I've left Jock.

1076
01:18:32,509 --> 01:18:34,009
This morning.

1077
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:36,510
He doesn't know it yet, and won't
till he finds my note.

1078
01:18:37,611 --> 01:18:39,511
I want a divorce.

1079
01:18:40,112 --> 01:18:42,112
And I want you to get it for me.

1080
01:18:42,913 --> 01:18:46,613
Is... is it another man?

1081
01:18:47,914 --> 01:18:50,514
No. And there won't be.

1082
01:18:51,715 --> 01:18:54,105
There couldn't be any othr man
except you, Bill.

1083
01:18:55,206 --> 01:18:57,506
And it wouldn't be fair to you this way.

1084
01:19:00,007 --> 01:19:01,407
No.

1085
01:19:02,608 --> 01:19:07,208
From now on I'm the cat
that walks by itself.

1086
01:19:08,809 --> 01:19:11,009
Mary, why are you leaving him now?

1087
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:13,010
Now that he's won his battle.

1088
01:19:13,011 --> 01:19:15,311
Or rather now that you've
won it fo him.

1089
01:19:17,412 --> 01:19:19,812
I stayed with him
when I could be of help to him.

1090
01:19:20,813 --> 01:19:23,613
I was the biblical wife.

1091
01:19:23,614 --> 01:19:27,900
But now... now we're all right again.

1092
01:19:27,901 --> 01:19:30,101
Both of us are all right.

1093
01:19:30,102 --> 01:19:33,402
He has his job and I have mine.

1094
01:19:33,403 --> 01:19:35,903
But that shouldn't make any difference.

1095
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:38,104
Oh, but it does.
Don't you see?

1096
01:19:38,105 --> 01:19:41,205
We don't need each other any more,
that's all.

1097
01:19:43,106 --> 01:19:46,006
We've nothing in common.

1098
01:19:49,607 --> 01:19:51,507
Nothing in common.

1099
01:19:53,008 --> 01:19:56,208
Nothing in common now
or in the future.

1100
01:19:59,409 --> 01:20:03,809
Will you make me out a bill of complaint,
or a brief, or what ever it's called?

1101
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:07,910
Say it's incompatibility,
say it's mutual fatigue.

1102
01:20:10,411 --> 01:20:12,111
Sai it's...

1103
01:20:14,112 --> 01:20:17,012
Say it's just ten years.

1104
01:20:21,003 --> 01:20:22,813
Mr. Wallace to see you.

1105
01:20:23,614 --> 01:20:25,814
Oh, I can't talk to him now.

1106
01:20:27,015 --> 01:20:28,415
In a minute.

1107
01:20:29,996 --> 01:20:31,316
Here.

1108
01:20:36,717 --> 01:20:38,817
Bill, please don't let him
know I'm here.

1109
01:20:38,818 --> 01:20:41,518
I... I just couldn't face him now.

1110
01:20:41,519 --> 01:20:42,819
What ever you want.

1111
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,120
- Yes, sir?
- Have Mr. Wallace come in now, please.

1112
01:21:05,421 --> 01:21:06,821
She's gone, Bill.

1113
01:21:06,822 --> 01:21:09,022
Mary's gone, she's left me.

1114
01:21:09,023 --> 01:21:12,523
I know. She, um... she was here.

1115
01:21:12,524 --> 01:21:14,024
Where is she?

1116
01:21:15,325 --> 01:21:17,605
She can't leave me now, she can't.

1117
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,596
Take it easy, Jock, don't...

1118
01:21:19,597 --> 01:21:21,697
Oh, it's easy to talk.

1119
01:21:21,698 --> 01:21:24,198
You've never loved. You don't know
what she can mean to a man, she's...

1120
01:21:28,899 --> 01:21:30,399
Help me, Bill.

1121
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,100
Help me.

1122
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:36,301
You might be able to tell her.
She might listen to you.

1123
01:21:36,302 --> 01:21:39,202
Tell her that she's all I've got,
all I want.

1124
01:21:39,203 --> 01:21:42,603
She's engaged me as her counsel.

1125
01:21:42,604 --> 01:21:44,104
As...

1126
01:21:45,905 --> 01:21:47,305
Oh.

1127
01:21:47,606 --> 01:21:49,306
I see.

1128
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:53,507
I'd hoped you might be able
to do something.

1129
01:21:55,608 --> 01:21:58,008
It's not only that I love her.

1130
01:21:59,009 --> 01:22:00,999
We have so much in common.

1131
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,000
What?

1132
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:06,701
I say we have so much in common,
it doesn't seem right...

1133
01:22:06,902 --> 01:22:08,702
It doesn't seem...

1134
01:22:19,403 --> 01:22:21,103
Mary.

1135
01:22:21,104 --> 01:22:22,904
Has he gone?

1136
01:22:25,505 --> 01:22:27,505
Bill, you promised me.

1137
01:22:27,506 --> 01:22:29,606
I know I did, but...

1138
01:22:39,707 --> 01:22:41,707
It's no use, Jock.

1139
01:22:43,608 --> 01:22:48,200
Well, there are certain legal formalities
that you'll have to submit to some time,

1140
01:22:48,219 --> 01:22:49,859
...so you might as well do it now.

1141
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:52,360
Sit down, please, both of you.

1142
01:22:52,561 --> 01:22:54,461
Mary, please.

1143
01:23:01,962 --> 01:23:03,862
Now let me make a few notes.

1144
01:23:03,863 --> 01:23:06,763
The plaintiff was married
to the defendant...

1145
01:23:06,764 --> 01:23:10,864
...ten years ago, on November 5th, 1925.

1146
01:23:11,965 --> 01:23:16,365
Ten years ago today in a rice-strewn
room in the old Waldorf...

1147
01:23:16,366 --> 01:23:18,466
...on the same plot of ground.

1148
01:23:18,467 --> 01:23:20,867
You were wearing a brown velvet dress.

1149
01:23:20,868 --> 01:23:23,768
You stood on tiptoe and said...

1150
01:23:23,769 --> 01:23:28,469
"Jock, tell me it will never be
any more wonderful than it is now."

1151
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:31,170
Because if it is, I simply
couldn't bear it.

1152
01:23:31,371 --> 01:23:34,271
There wasn't a cloud in your sky
back then.

1153
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:38,372
You had everything.
What happened between then and now?

1154
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:44,273
The plaintiff and the defendant returned
from a honeymoon abroad and settled down.

1155
01:23:45,974 --> 01:23:47,994
Remember that night on the train...

1156
01:23:47,995 --> 01:23:50,895
...when we were coming back from
the Dempsey-Tunney fight?

1157
01:23:50,896 --> 01:23:55,896
Remember your being angry because
Jock insisted on working...

1158
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:57,897
...and you wanted to play?

1159
01:23:57,898 --> 01:24:01,298
You wanted to have some
fun out of life...

1160
01:24:01,299 --> 01:24:03,399
...while you were still young
enough to enjoy it?

1161
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,100
That was your first quarrel,
I imagine.

1162
01:24:08,401 --> 01:24:10,301
Afterwards you were sorry.

1163
01:24:11,302 --> 01:24:13,202
But afterwards was too late.

1164
01:24:13,203 --> 01:24:16,203
Because by then something
had happened.

1165
01:24:17,004 --> 01:24:19,304
Something that was to hit
back at you later...

1166
01:24:19,305 --> 01:24:22,305
...when you stood in a doorway
with a compact in your hand.

1167
01:24:22,306 --> 01:24:26,406
And you said, "Oh, Jock, Jock!"

1168
01:24:26,407 --> 01:24:29,107
And the last thing I saw as I left...

1169
01:24:29,108 --> 01:24:32,008
...was him standing in front
of a door you'd locked.

1170
01:24:34,009 --> 01:24:35,809
But you came through that.

1171
01:24:36,410 --> 01:24:39,810
You even felt so secure
in each other that you decided...

1172
01:24:42,811 --> 01:24:44,811
The couple had no child.

1173
01:24:48,212 --> 01:24:50,700
What was it that separated you
after that,

1174
01:24:50,701 --> 01:24:52,501
when you should have been
closer than ever?

1175
01:24:53,202 --> 01:24:54,802
Shock?

1176
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:57,003
Yes, at first.

1177
01:24:57,004 --> 01:24:59,704
So you turned to making money
as a release and an escape.

1178
01:24:59,705 --> 01:25:02,405
And she turned to anything
she could find.

1179
01:25:02,406 --> 01:25:04,906
New clothes, new people.

1180
01:25:04,907 --> 01:25:07,807
Any opiate that would make her
forget the things she was feeling.

1181
01:25:07,808 --> 01:25:10,508
Mary needed you then, Jock.

1182
01:25:10,909 --> 01:25:12,309
Badly.

1183
01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:14,610
But you were to preoccupied
with success,

1184
01:25:14,611 --> 01:25:16,951
with the get-rich-quick schemes.

1185
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:19,612
Well, you got your success,
didn't you?

1186
01:25:19,613 --> 01:25:22,113
And your money.
And how long did it last?

1187
01:25:22,114 --> 01:25:24,914
As long as any bubble lasts.

1188
01:25:24,915 --> 01:25:27,115
And when it collapsed,
you collapsed with it.

1189
01:25:28,216 --> 01:25:32,316
You'd lost your perspective. Not only
about her, but about everything.

1190
01:25:32,997 --> 01:25:35,617
You couldn't even appreciate
what made her stick to you...

1191
01:25:35,618 --> 01:25:37,918
...when the false bottom
of your success fell out.

1192
01:25:38,219 --> 01:25:44,119
Through hard times, hard work, all the
things your egotism had brought it to.

1193
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,920
That Christmas Eve when we were
waiting for you to come home,

1194
01:25:51,421 --> 01:25:53,721
I did something I wanted to do
all my life.

1195
01:25:54,622 --> 01:25:56,622
I told Mary I loved her.

1196
01:25:57,523 --> 01:26:01,123
I held her in my arms and asked her
to come away with me.

1197
01:26:02,424 --> 01:26:04,824
Well, she didn't come away.

1198
01:26:06,025 --> 01:26:10,125
Instead she went to you
because you needed her once more.

1199
01:26:12,126 --> 01:26:15,706
When she came out of your room at the
hospital that night, she was crying...

1200
01:26:16,607 --> 01:26:19,907
...and said, "Oh, Bill, he's got to live."

1201
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:22,508
Yes, she said that.

1202
01:26:22,909 --> 01:26:26,809
And a moment later the nurse asked her
if she'd like to see the young lady.

1203
01:26:26,910 --> 01:26:30,210
She had every reason to leave
you then but she didn't.

1204
01:26:30,911 --> 01:26:32,700
She decided to stay with you
till the point...

1205
01:26:32,701 --> 01:26:35,701
where you could face the world
successfully as you did...

1206
01:26:35,702 --> 01:26:37,402
...last night at the casino.

1207
01:26:38,103 --> 01:26:39,703
And now...

1208
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,804
Now she feels her job's ended.

1209
01:26:44,305 --> 01:26:48,305
You went through all those
things together, the two of you.

1210
01:26:48,506 --> 01:26:50,906
And now you've come to me and said,

1211
01:26:50,907 --> 01:26:52,907
"We've nothing in common."

1212
01:26:54,308 --> 01:26:56,208
Nothing in common.

1213
01:26:57,009 --> 01:26:59,509
And you say "we've so much in common".

1214
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:02,410
And you're right because
you're speaking of the past.

1215
01:27:02,411 --> 01:27:05,511
And she's right because she's speaking
of the future.

1216
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:07,802
And she's afraid of it, Jock.

1217
01:27:08,103 --> 01:27:11,003
She's afraid of anyone who's been
through what you've been through...

1218
01:27:11,004 --> 01:27:13,004
...and hasn't been changed by it.

1219
01:27:13,005 --> 01:27:16,800
Last night she saw you beginning
the whole thing over again.

1220
01:27:16,906 --> 01:27:18,906
The casino thing, the money thing,

1221
01:27:18,907 --> 01:27:21,500
the success mania, penthouses
and sables.

1222
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:23,601
Those things are fine, she knows that.

1223
01:27:23,602 --> 01:27:26,802
But she's had them once
and they weren't enough.

1224
01:27:28,803 --> 01:27:31,103
And that's all you're offering her.

1225
01:27:31,704 --> 01:27:34,404
You had a chance to offer
her something else.

1226
01:27:34,405 --> 01:27:37,805
A new kind of existence,
it might be better, it might be worse.

1227
01:27:37,806 --> 01:27:39,406
Anyway it would be new.

1228
01:27:39,407 --> 01:27:41,307
And you laughed at it.

1229
01:27:43,408 --> 01:27:45,908
Look back over your life together, Jock.

1230
01:27:45,909 --> 01:27:48,609
Can you blame her for wanting
something different?

1231
01:28:41,510 --> 01:28:43,810
I'm afraid it's up to you now, Mary.

1232
01:28:44,711 --> 01:28:48,201
Shall I go ahead and draw up your briefs
so that I can get your divorce?

1233
01:28:48,202 --> 01:28:49,999
Or...

1234
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:58,400
You know the sort of brief
I'd rather draw up for you.

1235
01:28:59,501 --> 01:29:01,901
It would be a brief made up
of the day-to-day things...

1236
01:29:01,902 --> 01:29:04,302
...that you and Jock have
done together.

1237
01:29:04,303 --> 01:29:06,600
The words you've spoken.

1238
01:29:06,601 --> 01:29:08,101
The rooms you've lived in.

1239
01:29:08,102 --> 01:29:10,152
The streets you've walked.

1240
01:29:11,153 --> 01:29:13,653
A brief of the songs you've sung...

1241
01:29:13,654 --> 01:29:15,554
...and the tears you've shed.

1242
01:29:15,555 --> 01:29:18,455
And even the things your hands
have touched.

1243
01:29:19,856 --> 01:29:22,056
You and Jock together.

1244
01:29:22,057 --> 01:29:23,757
And I too.

1245
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:27,358
Though that doesn't matter anymore.

1246
01:29:28,459 --> 01:29:30,359
And never can matter.

1247
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,460
Well, I... I always wanted to winter
in the south.

1248
01:30:10,461 --> 01:30:13,761
I know, dear, but Tennessee's
not like Palm Beach.

1249
01:30:13,762 --> 01:30:15,662
It'd be calico for you.

1250
01:30:15,663 --> 01:30:19,263
And chin whiskers for you.
And aren't you going to look terrible?

1251
01:30:27,764 --> 01:30:29,964
That's a pretty picture, isn't it?

1252
01:30:31,565 --> 01:30:35,765
Yes... that's a portrait of marriage.

1253
01:31:01,266 --> 01:31:07,266
