1
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,222
What about
the sleeping pills?

2
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,657
I'm gonna be at the beach for a while,
and I wanted a supply...

3
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,692
I'm sorry. I can't give you
a refill on seconal.

4
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:40,228
I would if I could.

5
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,795
Oh, I almost forgot this.

6
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,897
Excuse me.
Is Gregg in?

7
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,602
Gregg. Gregg Crawford.
He works for you. Is he in?

8
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:50,571
I was supposed to meet him last
night and he didn't show up.

9
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,540
I was wonderin' where he is.
I'm sorry. I was here first.

10
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:53,841
Did he show up for work today,
or what?

11
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:54,975
I'm really sorry,
Mrs. Rawlings.

12
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,612
Uh... You check with your
doctor and have him call me.

13
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,481
And have a good weekend.

14
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,182
Yes, thank you.

15
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,320
I don't suppose it'll
come as a surprise

16
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:08,389
if I tell you we caught him with
his hands in the cookie jar.

17
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:14,328
Oh, well, I... Gee, I'm...
I'm dumbfounded.

18
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:15,963
Mmm-hmm. I'm sure.

19
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:18,866
Anyhow, it's outta my hands. Wait a minute.
What... What is that supposed to mean?

20
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,701
I mean, it's in the hands
of the law.

21
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,004
How could you do that?

22
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,574
People are beginning
to stare. Please.

23
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,344
Well, that's what happens
when you have guilt.

24
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:33,247
It feels like people
are starin' at you.

25
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,748
You know what?
They are staring at you.

26
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,781
Hello, Mrs. Rawlings.

27
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,317
I have your order
ready for you here.

28
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,752
Oh, good, thank you.
How are you today?

29
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,888
All right.
And yourself? Fine.

30
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,824
That's that wine chiller
that you ordered.

31
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,659
I think you're
gonna like it.

32
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:19,793
Has this been
in here all day?

33
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:20,994
It's been there
for over two hours.

34
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,763
Think about taking
one of our classes?

35
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,131
Well,
I took the Cuisinart.

36
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,466
I'll bet you don't have
the new ripple cut blades.

37
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:28,936
I have so many blades now,
I don't know what to do with them.

38
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:30,671
Hello.

39
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:36,910
I... I saw you at Schwab's, and it just
dawned on me who you are. Do you remember me?

40
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,449
I'm sure you do.

41
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,551
I'm sure I don't.

42
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,085
I did valet parking for you

43
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,688
for that big party at the beach
you had a few months back.

44
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,025
Excuse me.
Uh, thank you.

45
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,994
I'll see you again. Bye.
I hope so.

46
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,663
Can I get you something,
young man?

47
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,334
No, I don't...
I don't see anything I need.

48
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,571
Mrs. Rawlings?

49
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,706
Can I explain somethin'
to you?

50
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:09,577
Look, the only reason I'm bein'
friendly to you is 'cause...

51
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,114
I felt like bein' friendly after I
remembered what you did for me, that's all.

52
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:18,386
I thought about it a lot. I mean,
you were so mellow that night. Really.

53
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,321
You weren't standoffish
like you are now.

54
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,256
I know what
you're thinkin'.

55
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,760
You're thinkin' I got some chutzpah bein'
so nosy, right?

56
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,462
Well, all I wanna do is...

57
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:32,366
Is thank you for comin'
to my rescue that night, that's all.

58
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,868
What is it I did that
meant so much to you?

59
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,540
The dent.
It's still there.

60
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,074
That's... That's somethin'
you hardly ever see,

61
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,943
a dent in a
Mercedes-Benz, huh?

62
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,712
Not in Beverly Hills anyway.

63
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:47,114
There must be a law
or somethin'.

64
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,517
Now, do you remember me?
Dent? Me?

65
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,154
Your husband, he...
He accused me of makin' that dent.

66
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,924
Then he accused me
of being stoned, too.

67
00:05:56,957 --> 00:05:59,760
Which, I'll be honest,
I... I was, but...

68
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,995
So anyway, he...
He got me so paranoid, I thought, Jesus,

69
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,697
maybe I did make
the damn dent

70
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,198
and didn't feel it
or somethin'.

71
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:09,803
I mean, these cars are like bein'
in a goddamn cotton wad or somethin'.

72
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:13,541
So anyway, I... I just wanna thank
you for comin' to bat for me.

73
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:15,876
I guess you felt
protective, huh?

74
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,711
But I did make the dent.

75
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:18,912
I... I know you
made the dent.

76
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:21,048
It's just that...
You could've laid the blame on me.

77
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,784
I was stoned enough.
A lot of people would've.

78
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,586
That never occurred to me.

79
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:28,756
I know. That's what
knocked me out about you.

80
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,429
Uh, look, I think you've blown
this out of proportion a bit.

81
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:37,631
I wasn't worried about you.
I was just telling the truth.

82
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:39,500
I know you were
tellin' the truth,

83
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,435
but you were still
worried about me. Face it.

84
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:44,137
No. That's something
you've made up in your mind.

85
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:51,111
You know,
I wish I'd never brought up the subject.

86
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,447
I could've gone on thinking
you did somethin' nice for me.

87
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:57,585
Look, uh...
Uh, what is your name?

88
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:00,120
Think of Sunset.
Strip.

89
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,990
Oh, I'm sorry.
You've caught me on a bad day.

90
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:06,660
Well, that's okay. I... I'll remember you
the way I... I remembered you that night.

91
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:09,129
I think about it a lot,
you know.

92
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,931
'Cause I dig
thinkin' about it.

93
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:13,233
But, um...

94
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,235
It's unlikely I'll stop
thinkin' about it

95
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,504
just 'cause of
what happened today.

96
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,207
Look, what do you
want from me?

97
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,511
Well, I could use a lift
to San Vicente.

98
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,980
I'm sorry.
I'm going to the beach.

99
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,082
Oh. Maybe I'll see you
out there then.

100
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,718
My friends own a place
in the water like you.

101
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,828
Well, don't get arrested
for that dent, huh?

102
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,530
Take care.

103
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,066
So long.

104
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,579
Mrs. Rawlings! Hi.

105
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,513
I got somethin' for you.

106
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:37,918
Well, hi, there.

107
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:41,054
Um...
Think he remembers me?

108
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:42,823
I doubt it.

109
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,091
I'm sure he does. Oh!

110
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:49,296
Thank you.

111
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,198
Beautiful day
today, huh?

112
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:57,671
I'm glad
I bumped into you.

113
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,011
Do you mind?
I was really enjoying being alone.

114
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,149
Well, look. I... I just want to...
I'd like to give you a gift,

115
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,618
and then I'll split,
all right?

116
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,785
I think you'll like it.

117
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:14,087
You came all the way out here
just to give me a gift?

118
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,356
Well, I... I came out here
to see some people I knew,

119
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,058
to help move
my friend Gregg.

120
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,893
Then I thought
if I saw you accidentally

121
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,929
or bumped into you,
I'd give you some reds.

122
00:09:21,962 --> 00:09:23,296
So...
There you go.

123
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,770
I'm really
not interested.

124
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,642
They're 100%
pharmaceutical.

125
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:37,210
I mean, you don't
have to worry about that.

126
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,647
Here.

127
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,151
You wanna hear
somethin' crazy?

128
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:47,688
I hated to think
of you tossin' and turnin'.

129
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:55,863
Now, look, I'm only
giving you four,

130
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,365
because I don't like
to encourage pill-popping.

131
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,033
So here.

132
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,970
I guess I feel protective
of you or somethin'.

133
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:08,642
Whatever happened to valet parking?
Excuse me.

134
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,045
Wait a minute,
Miss Ultra-Frost.

135
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,648
You're the one who
wants the pills, not me.

136
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,120
How come
your hair's not wet?

137
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,655
Don't you like to swim?

138
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,229
That's a beautiful dress.
Are those mirrors?

139
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,397
Hell, those are mirrors.

140
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,132
Let go.

141
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,372
You know,
if you went swimming once in a while,

142
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,341
you probably wouldn't
even need these pills.

143
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,976
Wait a minute!
I got a question for you.

144
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,377
Can you hear me?
I'll come up!

145
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,779
I can hear you.
What?

146
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,180
I can hear you!
What is it?

147
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:50,350
Shouldn't we
keep in touch?

148
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,820
I mean, if I was around,
you probably wouldn't have to suffer

149
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:55,055
the humiliation of gettin'
these things legal.

150
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,990
I was so embarrassed
for you at Schwab's.

151
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,326
I mean, who needs it?
I mean, really?

152
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,829
I don't need that many pills,
so you don't have to worry.

153
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:03,663
Yeah, but you need your beauty sleep,
don't ya?

154
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,172
Okay, thanks.
Can I tell you somethin'?

155
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,275
Okay, one thing.
What is it?

156
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,010
All right.
Remember back there when I said

157
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,947
that I'd hate to think
of you tossin' and turnin'?

158
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,382
Well, I lied.
I love to think of you tossin' and turnin'.

159
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,384
Matter of fact...
Matter of fact, sometimes I...

160
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,920
I can't stop myself
thinking of it.

161
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,889
It's like a confession, all right?
I just thought I'd make it.

162
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:35,262
Hey, don't take it the wrong way!
Don't worry. I won't.

163
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,942
Yes. What is it now?

164
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,180
Your dog.

165
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,448
Did you mean to leave
him out? 'Cause he's out.

166
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,417
Thank you.

167
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,362
Mr. Rawlings?

168
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,264
I'll talk to you
in a minute, Bill.

169
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,368
Hello.

170
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,507
You were sleeping?

171
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,176
Oh, it's...
What time is it?

172
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,045
Oh, it's early.
I'm sorry.

173
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,616
I was gonna call you,
to tell you I was out here.

174
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,584
Naomi told me.

175
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:15,388
Trish, I thought we were
going to see each other.

176
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:18,491
There's so much
we have to decide on.

177
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:24,431
You seem so... Withdrawn.
Like you're not there.

178
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,267
I'm not.

179
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,337
Look. I... I know
you're angry and hurt.

180
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,372
Don't leave this
all up to me, please.

181
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:33,907
You left
the marriage up to me.

182
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,408
I'm leaving
the divorce up to you.

183
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,177
I hope you have better luck.

184
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:42,649
I'm sorry you found out about my
affair with Stacie the way you did.

185
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:45,385
Look, I should've
told you myself.

186
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:47,387
I... I kept meaning to.

187
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,026
Who's gonna tell Tim?

188
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,229
It would be easier on him
if it came from you.

189
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:58,665
But, uh, don't call him.

190
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:01,634
Wait till he comes home
next month.

191
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:06,073
Oh. Any way you tell him,
it's gonna hurt him, no matter what.

192
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:08,041
Trish?

193
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,444
Trish?

194
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:15,348
I wish he would write.
Uh, make sure that Maria forwards my mail.

195
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,650
I may stay for a while.

196
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:21,388
Trish. We've got to
talk about things.

197
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,391
Uh...

198
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,393
What about the pool filter?

199
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,133
What... What about it?

200
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,268
What do you
want me to do?

201
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,605
You decide.

202
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,210
All right.
I'll call you tomorrow.

203
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,613
Uh...

204
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:50,117
No, please don't.
I'm enjoying the quiet.

205
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,086
Okay? Bye.

206
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,317
It's okay.

207
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,153
Come here.

208
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,288
It's okay.

209
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:22,575
We can expect light variable winds
this morning under low clouds.

210
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:26,146
Winds turning
southwesterly to 17...

211
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,847
Surfing conditions should be
moderate today...

212
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,416
Scamp. Come here.
Come on.

213
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:32,319
...from Hollywood Beach all the
way to Malibu Beach. Come here.

214
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:35,155
Wave maximums are three feet
on a 12-second interval.

215
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,524
Good boy.
Good boy!

216
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,292
Air temperature is 82 degrees,
and sea temperature is...

217
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:42,362
Morning!

218
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,764
Hope you had
a good night's sleep.

219
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,199
Just fine, thank you.

220
00:17:48,301 --> 00:17:49,769
Can I borrow
a towel from you?

221
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,771
You don't have a towel?

222
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,773
Forget it. I'll just let
the sun dry me out.

223
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,343
It's better for you anyway.

224
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,480
Here, use this.

225
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,683
Thank you.
* She wants to know the reason

226
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:06,786
* Got to know the reason why
this man has got to go

227
00:18:09,189 --> 00:18:10,590
I would've brought
my own towel, but, uh...

228
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:14,727
I was gonna get it from my friend's house,
but guess what happened.

229
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:15,728
Don't you wanna know
what happened?

230
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:21,234
Okay, what?
They weren't there.

231
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:24,504
Last night, I had to sleep on the
beach with no blanket or nothin'.

232
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:26,139
Some friends, huh?

233
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,881
Are you finished
with that chicken?

234
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,450
Yes.

235
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:40,153
Are you gonna give it to Scamp
or throw it away, or what?

236
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,491
Would you like some?

237
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:46,226
Oh, yes.
Thank you.

238
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,832
Hi, Scamp.

239
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,268
Is that wine?

240
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,541
Thank you.
Here, Scamp.

241
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:02,809
No, don't feed him.

242
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,813
No? Okay.
Sorry, Scamp.

243
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:07,880
* She wants to know

244
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:13,186
* Wants to know the reason

245
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,489
* Got to know the reason why

246
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:19,726
* This man has got to go

247
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,795
* This man is always leavin'

248
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:26,466
* How he hates
to say goodbye *

249
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,469
See, the thing is,
most of my friends are undependable.

250
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,505
Except for Gregg,
and Gregg is in jail now.

251
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,674
But I told you that.

252
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,943
I gotta get him out.

253
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,884
Do you, uh,
like to cook?

254
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:47,887
I like to read.

255
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,891
The only reason I said
it is this chicken...

256
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:54,694
It's so well prepared.
What...

257
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:58,765
What do you do?
Do you... Do you deep-fry it, or, um...

258
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,400
Do you broil it?

259
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:09,276
Do you wanna be alone? If you wanna be alone,
I... I can take a hint.

260
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,577
Yes.

261
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,719
Geez, what a world.

262
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,521
Because my friends
are undependable,

263
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,723
I gotta put up with
this humiliation and hurt.

264
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:27,427
Look, take the chicken
and the wine, would you?

265
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,665
Look, I'm not that hungry,
even though I hate waste.

266
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:35,268
The only reason I came by was to tell you,
since you're into pills,

267
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:36,869
I can get you any kind
of mood changers you want.

268
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,005
I am not into pills.

269
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,274
Well, maybe you should be.

270
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:44,611
I mean, you need somethin' to mellow you out.
I mean, really.

271
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,546
You... You're so uptight.

272
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:52,452
Thanks for the chicken.

273
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:53,886
Have a nice day.

274
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,492
Did I leave my t-shirt here?

275
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:36,363
It's right over there.

276
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,731
Hi.

277
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:45,938
Excuse me.
Hey, can I talk to you?

278
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,940
No. Really,
it's an intrusion.

279
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,876
I know.
I know I've been an intrusion.

280
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:53,112
And I... And I... I do apologize.
It's just that...

281
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,014
You know, my friends
weren't here...

282
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:57,116
...and you can't imagine
what it's been like.

283
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,352
I mean, really.

284
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,089
Nice radio.

285
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:08,060
Well, look, if your friends aren't here,
why don't you just go home?

286
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:13,366
My car broke down.
That's how come.

287
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:18,905
My car's about as dependable
as my friends are.

288
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,342
I think you should
put on a sweater.

289
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:30,116
Well, I'd like to, but... But my backpack
got swiped. Do you believe that?

290
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:33,653
I'd like to get my hands on the
creep-geek who stole it too. Shit.

291
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,121
Excuse my language.

292
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,625
It was just a backpack.

293
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:40,059
Just a backpack?

294
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,931
Look, what if someone
were to go into your home

295
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,466
and clean you out,
lock, stock and barrel?

296
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,034
How would you feel
about that?

297
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,836
Or perhaps it's different
in this case

298
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,406
because you... You...
You probably got, uh, two homes, right?

299
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,776
I got one backpack.
I had one backpack.

300
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,911
Hey, but you know what?

301
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:02,782
Maybe whoever stole it needed it more
than I did. That's a possibility.

302
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:06,886
Did you ever think of that?

303
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:32,111
Strip. Strip!
Wait a minute.

304
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,016
I want you to drink this.

305
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,655
You might be
catching cold.

306
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,161
And here.
Put this on.

307
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:53,700
Tonight, why don't you sleep
in your car? You'll be warmer.

308
00:23:53,733 --> 00:23:55,702
You can have
this blanket.

309
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,208
Hmm.

310
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:08,180
I wonder if
you have a fever.

311
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,627
Maybe I should sleep
inside tonight.

312
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,631
You know,
where it'd be warmer.

313
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:29,468
No.

314
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,811
I should've known.

315
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,217
Just when I think
I should trust you.

316
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:47,153
Well, you know why
you don't trust me?

317
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:51,290
'Cause you're naturally
suspicious, that's why.

318
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:54,126
I never met a rich person
who wasn't.

319
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,997
I mean, like before. I wasn't gonna
take your radio or do anything to you.

320
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,766
I mean, really.

321
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:06,539
I got my doubts
about you too, lady.

322
00:25:06,573 --> 00:25:08,708
I tell you that.
I certainly do.

323
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:28,621
Hi.

324
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:37,730
Are you a member
of the Automobile Club?

325
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,934
Do I look like I'm a member
of the Automobile Club?

326
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:51,978
It's not even my car.
It's Gregg's.

327
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:53,880
I was gonna sell it
to help raise bail,

328
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:56,683
but now... Geez.
Who'd want it?

329
00:26:56,716 --> 00:27:00,753
Look, I can call AAA,
and they can pick the car up and fix it.

330
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,822
I'm sorry about
yesterday.

331
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,925
You're right. I am suspicious.
Of everything.

332
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,393
You sure are.

333
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,333
Look, will you stop following me?
No.

334
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:20,873
Well, what do you want?

335
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:24,877
I want you to come and have lunch
with me while they fix your car.

336
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,913
No.
Come on.

337
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:34,921
Get in.

338
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:44,864
You talked me into it.

339
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,069
How old are you?

340
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,948
What are you
having for lunch?

341
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,149
Salade Nicoise.

342
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,852
What's that?

343
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:07,686
Do you like it?

344
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:09,688
Mmm.

345
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:14,994
Is that tuna?

346
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,729
Yes, it's tuna.

347
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,734
Mmm, thank you.

348
00:28:33,846 --> 00:28:36,482
You know your friend...
What's his name?

349
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:38,851
Gregg. You must be
worried about him.

350
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:43,422
Yeah. Yes, I am.
Did you... Here.

351
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:47,726
Here's a picture of him.

352
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:52,364
Mmm. He looks
like he's nice.

353
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,434
Oh, yeah. He's the
smartest man I know.

354
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,809
Before, you said
you had to sell his car.

355
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:06,178
You see,
the judge set the bail at 5,000 bucks.

356
00:29:06,212 --> 00:29:08,114
It should only be 1,000.

357
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,416
Which means that they're probably
holding him for questioning.

358
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:13,519
'Cause they figure, you know, he...
He knows something... Which he does.

359
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,454
So what are you going to do?

360
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,157
Well, I need to get a lawyer to
get a writ of habeas corpus.

361
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:22,361
The only problem is that
the only lawyer I know, I...

362
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,964
I think he's in trouble
with the law himself, so...

363
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,900
Is that who
you keep calling?

364
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,809
What about your friends
out here? Can't they help?

365
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:39,245
They're layin' low.
Some friends.

366
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,453
This is lovely.
I mean...

367
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,556
This is really great.

368
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,425
Thank you.

369
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:56,528
Thank you.

370
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:08,908
You're not Gregg's
partner, are you?

371
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:10,843
No. I know what
you're thinkin'. No. It...

372
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,011
Look, we're just
best friends.

373
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:15,047
And Gregg is into the heavy-duty stuff,
I am not.

374
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:17,316
The only reason
I scored those reds was...

375
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,551
I was hopin' I could open up a
line of communication with you,

376
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:22,121
which I...
I think I did.

377
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:37,203
I think we should go check
on your car, don't you?

378
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:40,572
I understand.

379
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,945
Could I make another phone call?
Sure. Go ahead.

380
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:49,548
I'm... I'm sorry.

381
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:57,323
Hey, look at Scamp.

382
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,325
Looks like he went
swimmin' in a mud puddle.

383
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:03,395
Oh, no, not again!

384
00:31:03,429 --> 00:31:06,198
Oh, you little stinker.
Where have you been?

385
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:08,367
Where have you been?

386
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:20,412
Just look at you,
you little monkey.

387
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:22,381
Where is it that you go?

388
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,520
Can we get in the car now?
Is anything wrong?

389
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:31,590
Well, they, uh... They just bailed Gregg out,
so I... I don't know.

390
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,993
Well, that's good,
isn't it?

391
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:38,164
No, something's funny.
Something's funny. I gotta get back.

392
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,366
Stay. Wait a minute.
I'll be right there.

393
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,540
I wonder why this Santini guy
would wanna bail him out.

394
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,409
I'm sure it's cool though.

395
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:52,311
He just recently got in
tight with these guys,

396
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,480
and they... They seemed pretty
impressed with him, you know?

397
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,115
What guys?

398
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,484
Not organized criminals?

399
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:01,253
Well, I guess they're pretty
well organized, all right.

400
00:32:01,287 --> 00:32:02,621
Oh, Strip.

401
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,191
These honchos are
hard to impress, too.

402
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:08,260
I mean, it's probably easier gettin'
into your group than it is theirs.

403
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:09,561
Are you gonna be safe?

404
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,632
Are you worried?
Don't be.

405
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,168
'Cause, like,
me and Gregg, we...

406
00:32:16,202 --> 00:32:19,671
We've been... We've been on our own since,
like, 14 years old, and...

407
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:21,740
You know, I figure
the worst is over.

408
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:28,114
I been meanin'
to ask you somethin'.

409
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,715
How is your husband?

410
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:35,521
* The rain must fall

411
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:38,424
* But we can change There's
the station up there.

412
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,626
* Our understanding

413
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:44,363
You know, I always feel like I'm oversteppin'
my bounds with you or somethin'.

414
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:47,333
* So take a moment

415
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:20,699
Okay, Miss Fabulous,
thank you.

416
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:24,536
Thanks for the car and for,
um, the Salade Nicoise.

417
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:30,376
Hope I'll see you again.

418
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:31,677
And don't worry, okay?

419
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:04,042
Here you are.

420
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,050
Thank you.

421
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:27,666
Hello.

422
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,701
Trish.
Hey, are you all right?

423
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:34,240
Uh, Naomi. Uh...
Yes, I'm just fine.

424
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:37,176
Look, can I call you back?
I'm right in the middle of feeding the dog.

425
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:40,146
No, my sweet.
This is urgent.

426
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:43,682
I was lunching at Scandia,
and guess who I saw?

427
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:47,153
Stacie!
So?

428
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:49,421
So, guess who she
was having lunch with?

429
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:51,790
Oh, Naomi. Stu.
So what?

430
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,327
Oh, Trisha, would I call you and
torture you with a thing like that?

431
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:58,297
No, she was lunching
with Dan Santini!

432
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:00,232
What is that
supposed to mean?

433
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:01,667
Well, it means...

434
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,736
Well, one thing, it means
she wasn't lunching with Stu.

435
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,605
And for another,
you know Dan's reputation,

436
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:09,541
and you know he's just broken up
with his mistress, you knew that!

437
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,510
No, I...
I didn't know that.

438
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:14,313
Well...
Of course you didn't.

439
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:17,283
You don't know anything that's
going on in this town, do you?

440
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:20,752
Where would you be
without me? Hey, Trish.

441
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:23,189
...since
atmospheric conditions...

442
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:26,158
I thought you'd be
glad to hear all this.

443
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:28,527
Why do you seem so cut off?

444
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,530
Naomi, let me
call you back. I'm really...

445
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:33,865
I'm busy right now and, uh...

446
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:36,368
I... I can't talk.

447
00:35:36,402 --> 00:35:38,670
But I'm okay. I don't want
you to worry. I'm fine.

448
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:39,705
All right?
I'll call you later?

449
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:43,141
Bye.
Bye-bye.

450
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:22,948
Hey, Strip! I just heard
about Gregg. Man, I'm sorry.

451
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,035
Hey, Miss Mercedes!

452
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,371
How about havin'
some of this wine, huh?

453
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:26,312
You don't have to worry about a cork with
this wine, just your... Just your liver.

454
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:33,285
I found this dog out on the beach.
He was lookin' for a home.

455
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,957
Oh, what did I do
to upset you now?

456
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,660
I don't like your
coming here drunk.

457
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:45,331
Oh, just 'cause I'm drinkin',
that means I'm drunk, huh? Jesus.

458
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:47,599
You left your address book here.
I tried to call you.

459
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,837
I know. That's why
I'm here. Uh...

460
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,573
I was worried about where
it was and everythin'.

461
00:37:57,776 --> 00:38:01,580
May I use your ocean to

462
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,281
sober me up?

463
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,420
I don't care
what you do.

464
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:10,956
Well, you should.
Just don't come here drunk anymore.

465
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,860
Let me have him.
Let me have him.

466
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:18,564
I mean it.
You really have some nerve.

467
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,821
I'll leave your
things right up here for you.

468
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:47,759
Good morning.
I brought your breakfast.

469
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:49,428
Are you the new butler?

470
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,530
Don't you
remember last night?

471
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,399
Well... Well,
what happened to Godfrey?

472
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:55,133
I'm Godfrey.

473
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,970
You look so different.
What happened to those nice whiskers?

474
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,972
Turn around.
Let me look at you.

475
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:05,944
Thank you.
Will there be anything else?

476
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:07,312
Yes,
sit down and talk to me.

477
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,014
I like to talk in the morning
when your head is clear.

478
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:12,083
Especially if you've been
somewhere the night before.

479
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:16,021
No, because if you're uncomfortable,
I get uncomfortable

480
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,389
and forget
what I have to say.

481
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:20,592
If you insist.

482
00:39:20,626 --> 00:39:21,993
But it doesn't seem
very good form for a butler.

483
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:29,435
My book?
My address book?

484
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:32,671
I told you, I don't want you here when you're
drinking. My address book. You said...

485
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:36,408
I'm not drinking anymore.
I... I just wanted to...

486
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:37,943
I... I'm fine.

487
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,511
Can I have the...
The address book?

488
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:41,447
Okay, I have to get it.

489
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,482
You wait here, all right?

490
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:59,397
I'm... I'm sorry.

491
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:07,973
Strip?

492
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,815
What's wrong?

493
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,954
Come in. It's cold.
What's wrong?

494
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,728
They...

495
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,531
Gregg is dead.

496
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,868
They killed him.
Made it look like he OD'd.

497
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:40,572
Bailed him out and made
it look like he OD'd.

498
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,708
Oh, so...
I'm sorry.

499
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:51,983
Look at your hair. It's still wet.
Come on. Sit by the fire.

500
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:57,789
Sit down over here.

501
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:07,198
I'm sorry.

502
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,200
What a world, huh?

503
00:41:11,269 --> 00:41:13,972
Yes, what a world. Come on.
Look, your shirt's all wet.

504
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,941
Come on, let's take it...

505
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,253
Here, let me have it.

506
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,890
Come on. This one too.

507
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,096
Here.
Give me your shoes.

508
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:41,733
You see... They say
he got nervous.

509
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:44,536
He was gonna spill what he
knew about the operation.

510
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,538
He wouldn't have done it though.
I know that.

511
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,277
Are you cold?
Are you hungry?

512
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,781
I'm gonna get you a robe.

513
00:41:55,814 --> 00:41:58,149
Why don't you take off
those wet clothes?

514
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:13,098
Here. Put this on.

515
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,569
Take off those
wet trunks.

516
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:29,014
You know? I told him he was in
too tight with the high-ups,

517
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,216
but he wouldn't believe me.

518
00:42:31,249 --> 00:42:32,684
He thought I was jealous.
Right?

519
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,988
Come on. Lie down.

520
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:56,307
Are you leaving me?

521
00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:02,280
No. No, I'm just gonna
turn out the light.

522
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,153
Where are you?

523
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:10,656
I'm here. Okay.

524
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:15,093
Go to sleep, okay?

525
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:24,970
Go on. Go to sleep.

526
00:43:25,871 --> 00:43:27,839
Don't leave me.
I won't.

527
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:31,109
Go to sleep.

528
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,850
Come on.
Please, don't leave me.

529
00:43:38,884 --> 00:43:41,019
Please?
I won't.

530
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:45,323
Go to sleep.
I'll hold you.

531
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:08,413
My arm.

532
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,839
Hmm.

533
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46,077
Mmm.

534
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:38,196
Hi. Who is that?

535
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:58,416
Hi. Scamp brought
him home.

536
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:00,952
And where did
you come from?

537
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:02,453
He must belong to someone.

538
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,189
Not necessarily.

539
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:05,891
What shall we call him?

540
00:47:05,924 --> 00:47:08,293
I've been callin' him...
I've been tryin' out some names.

541
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:11,162
He likes "Corky."
Corky! See?

542
00:47:11,196 --> 00:47:12,864
Oh, he does.
He likes it.

543
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:15,300
That's what we'll call him.
Corky. Okay.

544
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:18,203
Let me see his foot.

545
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:19,604
Do you think this
is too tight?

546
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:21,973
It'll be fine.
It'll loosen up.

547
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,275
Will he be all right, you think?
Mmm-hmm.

548
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,346
Will you be all right?

549
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,122
What would you like
for lunch?

550
00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:39,057
Anything but
Salade Nicoise.

551
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:49,234
Bring him with us.

552
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,512
What are you doing?

553
00:48:34,545 --> 00:48:37,148
Are you writing Gregg's family?
No.

554
00:48:38,984 --> 00:48:41,019
I was... I was just...

555
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:44,422
I was gonna send this message
to whoever finds the bottle.

556
00:48:44,455 --> 00:48:46,457
I do it all the time.

557
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:49,260
Do you think that's weird?
No.

558
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:51,162
What does it say?

559
00:48:51,196 --> 00:48:52,930
No, I...
I can't tell you that.

560
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:59,004
You know, I'm probably known all over
the world and don't even know it.

561
00:49:22,227 --> 00:49:23,661
Mmm.

562
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:30,735
I wanna talk some more
about you.

563
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:33,104
What do you wanna know?
Everything.

564
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:38,243
Like what?
Mmm.

565
00:49:38,276 --> 00:49:41,646
Oh, like...
Well, who you are.

566
00:49:43,614 --> 00:49:45,616
How you met Gregg.

567
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:48,019
Hitchhikin'.

568
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:52,290
You were both runaways?

569
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,494
I don't like that word,
"runaway."

570
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:59,664
Makes it sound like someone's chasin' you.
Nobody was chasin' me.

571
00:50:02,067 --> 00:50:05,036
My folks, they could've found me,
if they cared.

572
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:06,804
I left plenty of clues.

573
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,674
I wasn't even runnin' that hard,
so I mean, you know...

574
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,344
Why did you leave?

575
00:50:15,213 --> 00:50:17,148
I don't wanna talk about it.

576
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,755
Mmm. You should be happy that
I want to know all about you.

577
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,692
And I do. Mmm.

578
00:50:34,199 --> 00:50:37,202
When did you leave?
I mean, how long ago was it?

579
00:50:39,304 --> 00:50:40,738
When?

580
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:48,346
September the 4th,
my 14th birthday.

581
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:51,349
Why?

582
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:55,220
Because they forgot
my 14th birthday, for one.

583
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:59,690
There were no birthday card,
candles, cake.

584
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:02,493
No "happy birthday."
Nothin', so...

585
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,629
But it wasn't just that
that ticked me off.

586
00:51:04,662 --> 00:51:07,865
I... I was ticked off before,
when they forgot my 13th birthday.

587
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,735
But, um...
I was gonna leave that year,

588
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:13,138
but I figured
I was too young.

589
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:14,939
So I made a promise
to myself.

590
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:19,877
I said, "Now, if they forget next year,
that's it. Finito. You're... You're gone."

591
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,512
So.

592
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:23,381
They forgot?
Yeah.

593
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:24,715
And you left?

594
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,451
Mmm.
Mmm.

595
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,290
Well, it was just what broke the
camel's back, I guess, you know?

596
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:36,294
I... It's not in my nature

597
00:51:36,327 --> 00:51:38,396
to stay where I'm not
wanted, so I don't...

598
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:42,800
Oh.

599
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:46,137
I know
how you must've felt.

600
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:49,840
But don't be bitter. Okay?

601
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:52,877
Just facing facts.

602
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,280
And all these questions

603
00:51:55,313 --> 00:51:56,947
that you're
askin' about me,

604
00:51:56,981 --> 00:52:00,685
I have a feeling that they're just your
way of not facing facts about yourself.

605
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:03,388
I mean, I'd... I'd like to ask
some questions about your life.

606
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:04,755
How about it?

607
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,924
Well, don't.
Why not?

608
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,594
Because I don't
have the answers.

609
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,899
Sometimes I...

610
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:16,834
I feel like
it's all been a waste.

611
00:52:19,237 --> 00:52:21,539
Now, don't you
go feelin' bitter.

612
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:26,911
Okay.

613
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:09,654
That's some stereo
you got.

614
00:53:31,008 --> 00:53:32,277
Come on.

615
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:58,903
I have something
I wanna tell you.

616
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:00,971
Mmm, Strip.

617
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:04,575
Trish, I wanna
tell you something.

618
00:54:04,609 --> 00:54:06,811
Let's smoke some pot.

619
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:08,446
No.

620
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:10,281
I don't want you doing drugs.
You hear?

621
00:54:11,316 --> 00:54:12,450
Why not?

622
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:14,719
That scene is nowhere.
I don't want you doing that.

623
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,454
Not even Sominex.

624
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:22,960
Okay. All right.
I won't.

625
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:30,301
What is it?

626
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,805
I love you.

627
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:36,374
I just thought
you should know.

628
00:54:40,878 --> 00:54:43,548
Do you love me?

629
00:54:43,581 --> 00:54:45,450
I know you do.

630
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,853
Just say it.

631
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:52,490
Strip.

632
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:54,425
You don't love me?

633
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,963
Oh, Strip...

634
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,068
Am I not good enough
for you? Is that it?

635
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:08,373
Oh, no, Strip, no.
That's just not true.

636
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:12,076
I was good enough for you
this morning, wasn't I?

637
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:13,844
You loved me this morning,
didn't you?

638
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:15,480
Yes.
I love you in bed.

639
00:55:15,513 --> 00:55:18,983
You just don't love me
out of bed.

640
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:21,452
Strip, wait.

641
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:26,724
Oh, this is... This is ridiculous.
Don't do this.

642
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:31,128
Oh, Strip, listen.

643
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,031
What... You're fooling around
with something I feel here.

644
00:55:37,568 --> 00:55:39,737
Look, when you're ready
to admit that you love me,

645
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:41,338
you can have me,
but not until.

646
00:56:22,747 --> 00:56:24,649
Strip.

647
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:32,156
What?

648
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:42,700
Look, if you're not ready to commit
to a meaningful relationship with me,

649
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:45,770
one that could be very beautiful,
could be very uplifting,

650
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:48,138
it's over.

651
00:56:48,172 --> 00:56:52,009
Because I've had it
with cheap sex. I have.

652
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:55,212
It leaves me
feelin' cheap.

653
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,848
Not that I don't feel lucky
that someone of your type

654
00:56:57,882 --> 00:57:00,551
wants to be... Make it with someone like me.
I do.

655
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:03,521
I've been lucky most of my life.
And, uh...

656
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:05,556
You know,
I'll be honest with you.

657
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:08,526
Maybe I've never lucked out
to this extent before.

658
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,528
But I'd be willing
to blow it,

659
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:14,565
because I think there's an
important principle at stake here.

660
00:57:17,702 --> 00:57:20,204
I don't...
I don't know exactly what, what it is.

661
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:23,541
I can't put my finger on it,
but, but I know it.

662
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:29,747
Can I, uh, tell you
something?

663
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:40,124
I've never had
cheap sex before.

664
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:42,693
I was sort of
looking forward to it.

665
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:50,701
And you thought that I would
be the perfect one to, uh...

666
00:57:50,735 --> 00:57:53,003
To do this with.

667
00:57:53,037 --> 00:57:54,672
Geez.

668
00:57:56,741 --> 00:57:58,676
Strip, no, I didn't.

669
00:58:00,778 --> 00:58:02,980
Oh, no, no, no.

670
00:58:07,585 --> 00:58:09,186
Listen.

671
00:58:12,222 --> 00:58:15,159
I don't even know what the word
"love" means anymore.

672
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:20,130
I don't even know
what cheap sex is.

673
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:53,964
Oh, I do love you.

674
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:57,568
Oh, I do love you.

675
00:58:58,736 --> 00:59:00,571
I do.

676
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:05,242
I was sure you did.
Mmm.

677
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:10,648
Thank you for the shirt.
I really like it.

678
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:12,950
I'm glad.
I love the way you look in it.

679
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:15,720
Thanks.

680
00:59:15,753 --> 00:59:19,023
What are you
thinking?

681
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,759
I'm thinking...
What?

682
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,295
That I wish we were
home together in bed.

683
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:27,164
That's exactly
what I'm thinking.

684
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:29,600
Were you?
Mmm-hmm.

685
00:59:31,636 --> 00:59:34,338
I'm also thinking
how special you are.

686
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,709
Remarkable, really.

687
00:59:38,743 --> 00:59:40,310
You are.
You don't know it, but you are.

688
00:59:46,651 --> 00:59:49,186
What else?

689
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:54,825
I'm wondering what you're
gonna do with your life.

690
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:57,728
It's exciting. It is.

691
00:59:57,762 --> 01:00:00,631
Well, I don't know.
I mean...

692
01:00:00,665 --> 01:00:02,900
I guess I've been wondering
the same thing, but...

693
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:07,271
Oh, Strip.

694
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:11,909
I wanna ask you something.

695
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:15,946
Okay, remember when I walked
into the cook store

696
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:20,384
and I asked you did you remember me,
and you said, "No"?

697
01:00:20,417 --> 01:00:22,386
Didn't you remember me?

698
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:30,728
Yes, I remembered you.

699
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:33,964
Oh, I thought so.
Good.

700
01:00:35,766 --> 01:00:37,301
You just didn't want to admit it,
probably, right?

701
01:00:43,373 --> 01:00:45,309
I just didn't
want to admit it.

702
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:49,179
I was thinking
of your old man.

703
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:51,849
What'd he do? Discover the formula
for frozen yogurt or something?

704
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:54,919
What?

705
01:00:54,952 --> 01:00:56,320
He's in real estate.

706
01:00:56,353 --> 01:00:57,788
Oh.

707
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,427
Well, you'll always have a roof
over your head, huh? I suppose so.

708
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,467
See, I know
I got the ability.

709
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,370
If I just put my mind to somethin',
I can do anything.

710
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:20,244
Well, you got any ideas?
I mean, maybe you could help me.

711
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:25,382
You can do anything you want.
You don't need me.

712
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,417
Don't even think that.

713
01:01:28,753 --> 01:01:30,187
Okay?

714
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:34,759
I love you.

715
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:01,886
Are you getting tired of
me saying "I love you"?

716
01:02:01,919 --> 01:02:04,889
'Cause if you are,
I don't have to say it so much.

717
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:07,257
No, I want you to say it.
You do?

718
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:09,026
Please say it.

719
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,829
Say it.

720
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,266
Mmm.

721
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:34,751
Give me some more kisses
on my neck.

722
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:41,058
Mmm.

723
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:46,831
Ow!
Oh, I'm sorry.

724
01:02:46,864 --> 01:02:49,366
Oh, I'm sor...
Did I hurt you?

725
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:51,568
It's okay. It's just my eye.
But don't...

726
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,770
Would you mind
taking it off though?

727
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:59,043
I don't like you wearing it anyway.
Makes me think of him.

728
01:02:59,844 --> 01:03:01,545
Can you help me?

729
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:08,953
This must've cost
a pretty penny, huh?

730
01:03:08,986 --> 01:03:11,555
You'd think they'd think of
a better way of takin' it off.

731
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:19,964
All of these...
These little trinkets mean somethin' special?

732
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:23,067
They did at one time.

733
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:30,240
I'm not talking about
the bracelet anymore.

734
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:32,109
Mmm.

735
01:03:33,377 --> 01:03:35,412
What's the matter?

736
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,214
Nothing.

737
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:45,222
It's just...

738
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:47,357
Are you jealous?

739
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:52,429
You got so many nice things,
you know.

740
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:56,266
Are you jealous
you don't have 'em?

741
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:58,068
No, I'm jealous
I can't give 'em to you.

742
01:04:02,272 --> 01:04:05,409
Maybe I'm jealous the other way too.
I don't know. Could be.

743
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:11,315
Don't be jealous.

744
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,583
Don't be jealous.
Mmm?

745
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,898
Do you know
how happy you make me?

746
01:04:29,166 --> 01:04:30,534
Do you know that?

747
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:33,203
Do you know how happy
you make me?

748
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:11,275
Do you think
I'd make a good disc jockey?

749
01:05:11,308 --> 01:05:16,080
I'm not sure there
could be such a thing.

750
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:18,448
There are no small craft
advisories...

751
01:05:18,482 --> 01:05:22,519
One time I thought I'd like to paint
billboards, like on Sunset Boulevard.

752
01:05:22,552 --> 01:05:25,122
They got billboards with
the rock stars and stuff.

753
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:28,658
Uh-oh.
Come here. Come here.

754
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:36,600
Thought I'd make a good vet.
But I can't stand needles.

755
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:39,536
Well,
that makes it tough.

756
01:05:39,569 --> 01:05:42,139
Mmm.

757
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:44,108
At least you wanted
to be something.

758
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:47,577
I've never even thought
of what I wanted to be.

759
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:48,345
Tell you one thing
though.

760
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:51,515
I am so tired
of just gettin' by.

761
01:05:54,084 --> 01:05:56,653
That's what we all do
in one way or another.

762
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:01,025
We all do.

763
01:06:01,058 --> 01:06:05,629
Well, I would like to get by like you're
gettin' by any day, I'll tell you that.

764
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:08,132
* Sometimes when we touch

765
01:06:08,165 --> 01:06:10,600
So your husband's
into real estate, huh?

766
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:14,038
So am I. Sand castles.
You interested?

767
01:06:14,071 --> 01:06:17,174
* And I have to
close my eyes Yes.

768
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:19,543
* And hide

769
01:06:21,378 --> 01:06:24,714
Now, in a minute a wave is gonna come
up and do away with this castle.

770
01:06:24,748 --> 01:06:27,284
I know. That's why
I'm decorating it.

771
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:30,254
Typical.

772
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:31,755
* I wanna hold you I want
to get a picture of it.

773
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:33,757
* Till the fear in me
subsides *

774
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:36,993
Come on. Get over there.
Oh, this is so beautiful.

775
01:06:38,762 --> 01:06:41,998
This really looks pretty.
Come on, smile.

776
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:50,340
Get the dogs.
I wanna get a picture of all of you together.

777
01:06:50,374 --> 01:06:51,675
Scamp! Corky!
Come here!

778
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:52,909
Corky,
get over here.

779
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:55,745
Come here. Come on. Get over here.
Come here. Oh, yeah.

780
01:06:58,282 --> 01:06:59,649
Come on, Scamp.
Smile.

781
01:07:02,086 --> 01:07:04,254
Okay, let me
have the camera.

782
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:08,125
All right, you take a picture now.
Oh, no, I don't want to.

783
01:07:08,158 --> 01:07:11,195
Oh, come on, Trish! No.
Come on. No, I don't want to.

784
01:07:11,228 --> 01:07:13,763
Come on.
I want you to go shopping for me. Trish!

785
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:16,233
I got ya.

786
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:20,270
Come on.

787
01:07:20,304 --> 01:07:23,107
Hey, this one's gonna be
a good one for me. Look.

788
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,708
Let me see.
Here, spray your feet.

789
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:26,610
Oh, this is.
This is real good.

790
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:29,813
Ooh, I love this.
You've got a great eye.

791
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:32,716
Maybe I should be a photographer.
Maybe. Come on.

792
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:35,085
Listen, I've got the list
all made, so hurry.

793
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:38,722
Come on.
Come on, you guys.

794
01:07:41,291 --> 01:07:46,496
* I wanna hold you till
the fear in me subsides *

795
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,266
No, I... Marie, I don't
want you driving out here.

796
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:50,767
It's silly to come
to the beach.

797
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:54,238
I'm keeping the house clean.
I promise.

798
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:56,706
No, you'd be proud of me.

799
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,443
Listen. How are things there?

800
01:07:59,476 --> 01:08:01,478
Oh, did you forward
my mail?

801
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:04,314
Good. Anything from Tim?

802
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:08,185
Nothing?
Trisha?

803
01:08:08,218 --> 01:08:10,320
Listen. Somebody just came in.
Trisha?

804
01:08:10,354 --> 01:08:11,821
No, no. No, no.
I have to go.

805
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:13,823
Trisha?
Okay. Adios.

806
01:08:16,493 --> 01:08:18,828
Oh!

807
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:21,131
I am glad to see that
you are alive and well.

808
01:08:21,165 --> 01:08:22,899
I've been calling
and calling.

809
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:25,502
I know, Naomi.
I haven't been answering.

810
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:27,371
Well, I know.

811
01:08:27,404 --> 01:08:29,873
Hey, I just got worried.

812
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:33,410
Stu too.

813
01:08:33,443 --> 01:08:35,645
He wanted to come out too,
but he didn't want to upset you.

814
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:38,682
I wish both of you would stop worrying,
really.

815
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:41,185
And you shouldn't have taken the
trouble to drive all the way out here.

816
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:43,853
Oh, I had to come out anyway
to check on my house.

817
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:46,623
I, uh, should have
come out sooner.

818
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:50,160
Or I should have had you check on
that extra room we're building on.

819
01:08:50,194 --> 01:08:54,331
Oh, I wish we had used
redwood instead of cedar.

820
01:08:54,364 --> 01:08:57,701
Cedar looks like
a huge, empty closet.

821
01:09:02,539 --> 01:09:05,509
Uh, Naomi, why don't
we go downstairs?

822
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:08,845
I would love it if you
would fix me a drink.

823
01:09:10,347 --> 01:09:11,781
Come on.

824
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:14,618
Is that a new dress?
Of course.

825
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,821
It looks great. When do you think they're
gonna have your house done, anyway?

826
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:20,790
By the time they finish my house,
it will have slipped into the ocean.

827
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:23,693
Yes, this one too,
I think.

828
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:26,830
What do you want?
Vodka or gin?

829
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:28,565
Both.

830
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:31,835
Oh, Naomi, you always give me a laugh.
That's good.

831
01:09:31,868 --> 01:09:36,840
Before I forget, Peg made me promise to beg
you to come to her new gallery opening.

832
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:39,409
She's been trying
to reach you, too.

833
01:09:39,443 --> 01:09:42,212
We both agree it would be good
for you to show your face,

834
01:09:42,246 --> 01:09:44,914
and give everyone a chance to see
that you're not falling apart.

835
01:09:48,452 --> 01:09:52,289
You're not, are you?
Falling apart?

836
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:54,424
No, I'm not.

837
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,560
Good.

838
01:09:56,593 --> 01:09:59,829
Well, what'll I tell Peg?

839
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:02,232
Oh, gosh,
I don't... Um...

840
01:10:02,266 --> 01:10:04,768
Let me see how I feel,
but I don't think so.

841
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:07,737
Well, I can't say I blame you.
I'm not looking forward to it myself.

842
01:10:07,771 --> 01:10:11,741
Guess what her theme is.
I'll tell you. You'll never guess.

843
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:15,879
She's got this photographer who
does huge blowups of feet...

844
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:19,483
In all sizes,
shapes and forms.

845
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:23,019
Can you imagine?

846
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:26,022
She's calling the exhibit
"foot-ography."

847
01:10:28,292 --> 01:10:29,526
Do you think
that's a good idea?

848
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,695
Oh, gosh,
I don't know.

849
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:35,365
I don't think it's a good idea.
I never like Peg's ideas.

850
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:38,001
Well,
at least she does something with her ideas.

851
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:41,471
That's more
than I can say.

852
01:10:41,505 --> 01:10:44,808
You should see Peg lately.
She is crazier than a loon.

853
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:48,044
I don't know if I could face the
gallery opening, but I do miss Peg.

854
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,747
Aren't you having
one of these?

855
01:10:51,781 --> 01:10:53,983
We all have ideas.

856
01:10:54,017 --> 01:10:58,388
Sometimes the real talent is knowing
when not to do anything with them.

857
01:11:01,858 --> 01:11:04,861
You know how she got the idea?
I can't imagine.

858
01:11:04,894 --> 01:11:07,063
Her new gallery is
right next to a shoe store,

859
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,666
and, zap, the foot-ography
concept pops into her mind.

860
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:20,410
I admire Peg though.
She's so self-sufficient.

861
01:11:20,444 --> 01:11:24,013
I can never get you to say
anything bad about anybody, can I?

862
01:11:24,047 --> 01:11:25,682
It is very comforting
to know

863
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:29,753
that when I have a bad idea
you will stand up for me, too.

864
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,356
You have many times,
haven't you?

865
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:34,958
Okay, kid. I will put it
on the calendar.

866
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:36,793
September 2nd.
Gallery opening.

867
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:40,564
Hi.

868
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:43,032
Oh, thanks so much.
Listen, I'll take those.

869
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:45,335
Let me have them.

870
01:11:47,103 --> 01:11:48,972
Oh, wait.
I have something for you.

871
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:00,350
Thank you.

872
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:07,023
No, thank you.

873
01:12:32,982 --> 01:12:35,552
Oh, God. Oh, Naomi.

874
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,056
I've done something
terrible.

875
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,926
Yes, I figured you had.

876
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,861
Oh, God.

877
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:48,064
Trisha, what on Earth
have you been up to?

878
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:50,767
How could I do
something like that?

879
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,511
I've gotta go after him.
Will you come with me?

880
01:13:01,545 --> 01:13:03,413
Please. Come on.
Go with me.

881
01:13:03,447 --> 01:13:06,149
I'm right behind you, girl.
Oh, how could I do that?

882
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:09,052
Come on. Oh, Naomi.
Oh, I shouldn't have.

883
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:10,687
Come on.

884
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,195
Here it is.

885
01:14:07,611 --> 01:14:10,947
Excuse me.
I'm looking for this Strip person.

886
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:14,718
* It was dark at midnight
I think he's back up here.

887
01:14:14,751 --> 01:14:18,522
* There was hardly any moon

888
01:14:18,555 --> 01:14:21,825
* And no one really saw much

889
01:14:21,858 --> 01:14:24,060
Um, excuse me.
* And no one was really sure

890
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:26,763
The gentleman
over here said...

891
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:30,199
* Something didn't seem right I don't know.
I haven't seen him in a while.

892
01:14:30,233 --> 01:14:34,270
* Something seemed kinda queer

893
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:37,907
* A roar turned into whispers

894
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:40,510
* Everyone stood there

895
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:45,281
* As the sound split the night

896
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,083
* They ran
hiding from the light

897
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:48,852
* Like strangers in the night

898
01:14:54,624 --> 01:14:58,828
* Well, I didn't
see no shotgun

899
01:14:58,862 --> 01:15:01,497
* And I didn't see no knife I
think it's this way. Come on.

900
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:39,202
Excuse me.
Do you know this person...

901
01:15:57,621 --> 01:15:59,589
Excuse me. Do you know
this fellow on the right?

902
01:16:42,298 --> 01:16:44,968
I know what you're thinking.
I doubt it.

903
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:51,040
I was thinking how boring shopping at
Bonwit's is gonna seem from now on.

904
01:16:54,844 --> 01:16:57,280
You gonna be all right?
Yes. Sure.

905
01:16:57,313 --> 01:17:00,817
Do you need some company at the house
tonight? I'd rather be alone. Thanks.

906
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:04,287
Besides, my wisecracks wear a bit
thin after a while, don't they?

907
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,989
No.
I know.

908
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:08,892
Well, why don't you say it?

909
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:10,894
I might just as well
have told you.

910
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:12,929
You would've read it in the
papers tomorrow anyway.

911
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:15,164
Didn't save myself much,
did I?

912
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:24,373
You don't owe me
an explanation.

913
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:26,943
I didn't want it this way.

914
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:29,178
I'll bet you didn't.

915
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:34,150
Johnny, don't you realize
you're in danger here?

916
01:17:34,183 --> 01:17:37,020
That isn't
what worries me.

917
01:17:37,053 --> 01:17:39,188
I came here
to do something.

918
01:17:40,423 --> 01:17:42,658
But you fixed that too.

919
01:17:45,061 --> 01:17:47,096
Johnny!

920
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:59,275
Who is it?

921
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:01,410
Your delivery boy.

922
01:18:04,047 --> 01:18:06,049
Strip.

923
01:18:06,082 --> 01:18:07,951
I'm sorry.

924
01:18:09,819 --> 01:18:13,422
I've looked everywhere for you.
I'm so sorry.

925
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:14,891
Listen, I...
Please come in.

926
01:18:14,924 --> 01:18:19,328
Look, I just came by to get my address book,
and then I'm splittin'.

927
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:21,430
Corky! Corky.

928
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:29,806
Please forgive me. Hey, look, look,
I just want my book. That's all.

929
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:36,012
It's upstairs
in my bedroom.

930
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:38,714
Oh, upstairs
in your bedroom, huh?

931
01:18:46,155 --> 01:18:47,924
I'm s... I'm sorry.

932
01:19:14,818 --> 01:19:17,020
Strip, come here.

933
01:19:22,125 --> 01:19:25,995
Please come here.
Let's make up.

934
01:19:26,029 --> 01:19:28,531
I don't like you being so ashamed
of me in front of your friends.

935
01:19:30,366 --> 01:19:32,902
Oh, God,
I'm not ashamed of you.

936
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:39,275
I'm just bothered by how
much older I am than you.

937
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:42,478
I couldn't deal with it
all of a sudden.

938
01:19:48,551 --> 01:19:51,120
I want to deal with it.
I don't care what people think.

939
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:00,529
Please.

940
01:20:03,032 --> 01:20:05,201
Please, let's make up.

941
01:20:14,210 --> 01:20:15,912
You are crazy about me,
aren't ya?

942
01:20:17,981 --> 01:20:19,315
What if I were to
break your heart?

943
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:22,051
How would you feel
about that? Huh?

944
01:20:22,085 --> 01:20:25,088
You already have.
Good.

945
01:20:25,121 --> 01:20:27,456
Makes us even then,
huh?

946
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,429
I was so worried.

947
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:36,332
Where did you go?

948
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:40,136
There are a lot of places I
could go without coming here.

949
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:45,208
Only,
who'd wanna be there?

950
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:53,349
Oh, I missed you.
I missed you.

951
01:20:53,382 --> 01:20:56,052
Don't ever go away
like that.

952
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:57,520
Mmm.

953
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:02,291
I've been thinking I want you
to go somewhere with me.

954
01:21:02,325 --> 01:21:04,127
Where?
A party.

955
01:21:05,394 --> 01:21:07,430
If it's one of them tux gigs,
count me out.

956
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,499
Mmm, I don't care
how you go.

957
01:21:10,533 --> 01:21:13,469
You can go naked
for all I care.

958
01:21:13,502 --> 01:21:15,972
If we're gonna shock them,
we might as well go all the way.

959
01:21:16,272 --> 01:21:17,907
Mmm.

960
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:25,248
Mmm.
Say it.

961
01:21:25,281 --> 01:21:26,549
Go on. Say it.

962
01:21:28,317 --> 01:21:31,620
I love you. I love you.

963
01:21:33,122 --> 01:21:35,391
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

964
01:21:40,663 --> 01:21:43,466
I know what good art is. Listen to Peg, okay?
Have I ever steered you wrong?

965
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:45,101
Are you okay?
Yeah.

966
01:21:45,134 --> 01:21:49,305
Life is a risk, you know, so if you're
gonna risk it, just jump right into it.

967
01:21:51,474 --> 01:21:54,177
What do you think?
Do you like it? I'm not sure.

968
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:57,146
Oh, God!

969
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,415
Uh, Dr. Scholl, yes.
Art? No.

970
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:02,118
Hi! I'm so glad
you could come, dear.

971
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:04,287
I hope that you
like everything.

972
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,622
I have never seen anything like this.
Interesting.

973
01:22:08,391 --> 01:22:11,127
Let's go over here.
Did you say Trish was here?

974
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:13,963
I didn't see her.
Where is she?

975
01:22:15,298 --> 01:22:17,700
Can I get you anything?

976
01:22:23,539 --> 01:22:26,675
I don't like to see you
drink so much at your age.

977
01:22:29,012 --> 01:22:30,413
I'm not so young
as I used to be,

978
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:32,481
and this party's gonna
turn me gray overnight.

979
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:35,018
Hi, kids!
Oh, Naomi, hi.

980
01:22:35,051 --> 01:22:36,252
Hi.
Hi.

981
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:38,154
Hello.

982
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,323
Oh, how radiant
you look.

983
01:22:40,356 --> 01:22:43,692
I can't say I blame you
for wanting to find him.

984
01:22:43,726 --> 01:22:46,129
We should've looked harder,
you know.

985
01:22:48,031 --> 01:22:49,432
Uh, are you having
a good time?

986
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:51,067
Of course you're not
having a good time.

987
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,536
Whoever does
at these things?

988
01:22:53,569 --> 01:22:56,739
Excuse me. Would you mind if I
borrowed Trisha for just one second?

989
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:58,141
Thank you.
I'll be right back.

990
01:22:58,174 --> 01:23:01,644
Trish, if I were you,
I would take him around and show him off.

991
01:23:01,677 --> 01:23:04,213
I would just love
to see Stu's face.

992
01:23:04,247 --> 01:23:07,616
Please.
He'll be back in your arms where he belongs.

993
01:23:07,650 --> 01:23:09,352
I know what
I'm talking about.

994
01:23:09,385 --> 01:23:13,056
Oh, Naomi, I'm no good at playing those
games. Then let me play them for you.

995
01:23:13,089 --> 01:23:14,657
I am a master.

996
01:23:14,690 --> 01:23:17,093
Is Stacie here?
Yes, she's over there.

997
01:23:17,126 --> 01:23:19,695
Did they come together? No, no, look.
She's with Dan Santini.

998
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:23,132
Trish!
Trish, how are you?

999
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:26,435
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.
Peg.

1000
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:29,438
Naomi, thank you for coming. Oh, Peg,
you've done it again. What more can I say?

1001
01:23:29,472 --> 01:23:33,008
You have to see this one!
This one's really super!

1002
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:39,615
Look around.
You're bound to find something.

1003
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,317
I'm sorry.

1004
01:23:42,785 --> 01:23:46,455
Do you still love me?
Oh, yes.

1005
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:50,426
Do you feel people staring at us?
Yes, I do.

1006
01:23:50,459 --> 01:23:52,395
It doesn't bother you?

1007
01:23:52,428 --> 01:23:55,631
It doesn't seem to.
I thought it might, but it doesn't.

1008
01:23:55,664 --> 01:23:59,068
Well, if they're staring at us,
it means they're talking too, doesn't it?

1009
01:23:59,102 --> 01:24:01,070
Well, let them.
Mmm.

1010
01:24:05,108 --> 01:24:07,176
Are you sure you're not just
using me to make him jealous?

1011
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:10,146
Are you?

1012
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:17,753
Well, maybe. I... Maybe.
I don't think so.

1013
01:24:17,786 --> 01:24:19,054
You don't think so?

1014
01:24:19,088 --> 01:24:23,759
Well, I mean, it... It's not my intention.
Not consciously.

1015
01:24:23,792 --> 01:24:27,296
I'm... No, I know...

1016
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:30,166
Wait, uh...
Oh, Strip.

1017
01:25:02,198 --> 01:25:05,401
I hope you realize you've succeeded
in making fools of both of us,

1018
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,535
if that was your plan.

1019
01:25:06,569 --> 01:25:07,536
You know it wasn't.

1020
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:10,573
But I agree.
We are behaving like fools.

1021
01:25:19,182 --> 01:25:22,651
Believe me, Trish, you have my sympathy.
You know that.

1022
01:25:22,685 --> 01:25:26,622
Come on. You think
I'm a frustrated

1023
01:25:26,655 --> 01:25:29,825
middle-aged woman with a
crush on a street kid.

1024
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:32,728
Who may be in the business
of preying on rich women.

1025
01:25:32,761 --> 01:25:34,897
Yes, I think that's
a distinct possibility.

1026
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:36,265
That's why I'm being
so sympathetic.

1027
01:25:36,299 --> 01:25:39,702
Well, you couldn't possibly think
that if you knew him the way I do.

1028
01:25:39,735 --> 01:25:44,240
I don't pretend to know him, but I know you,
and you're not your old self.

1029
01:25:44,273 --> 01:25:47,176
Thank God.
I was bored with that person.

1030
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:49,745
All right,
let me try another tactic.

1031
01:25:49,778 --> 01:25:53,216
None of your friends will ever trust
you again with their teenage sons.

1032
01:25:53,249 --> 01:25:56,151
Oh, God,
you're probably right.

1033
01:25:56,752 --> 01:25:59,588
Or I could
put it another way.

1034
01:25:59,622 --> 01:26:03,426
It won't last.

1035
01:26:03,459 --> 01:26:06,495
That's something no one
ever said about Stu and me.

1036
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:10,098
Tim will be returning.

1037
01:26:10,132 --> 01:26:13,336
How on Earth are you going to explain Strip?
Have you thought of that?

1038
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:14,937
Yes, all the time.

1039
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,539
I don't know.
I'm not...

1040
01:26:16,572 --> 01:26:18,774
I'm not saying it
could last with Strip.

1041
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:21,210
I never thought
it would.

1042
01:26:21,244 --> 01:26:24,280
I wasn't ready for it to end just yet,
that's all.

1043
01:26:24,313 --> 01:26:27,283
You've had your
desirability reaffirmed.

1044
01:26:27,316 --> 01:26:28,717
Isn't that enough?

1045
01:26:28,751 --> 01:26:30,253
There was
more than that.

1046
01:26:30,286 --> 01:26:32,255
He has nothing, nobody.

1047
01:26:32,288 --> 01:26:34,490
I couldn't
turn him away.

1048
01:26:34,523 --> 01:26:38,327
He just lost his best friend.
He seemed so needful.

1049
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:40,329
I don't know.
Something about him just touched me.

1050
01:26:41,597 --> 01:26:44,433
But it's over now?

1051
01:26:44,467 --> 01:26:47,236
If he comes back,
you will tell him that?

1052
01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:49,772
I think
he already knows that.

1053
01:27:12,027 --> 01:27:13,429
You left
your door open.

1054
01:27:13,462 --> 01:27:16,365
I know I did.

1055
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:18,801
How come you ran away
from the party like that?

1056
01:27:18,834 --> 01:27:20,469
What was wrong?
Don't.

1057
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:23,872
Was it seeing Stu
that upset you so much?

1058
01:27:24,473 --> 01:27:25,874
Maybe.

1059
01:27:25,908 --> 01:27:27,576
It could be
some other things too.

1060
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:38,421
Like I was worried that I wasn't
good enough for your crowd,

1061
01:27:38,454 --> 01:27:40,323
that they'd look down
their nose at me.

1062
01:27:40,356 --> 01:27:43,426
Which I was right,
they did.

1063
01:27:43,459 --> 01:27:45,861
And then I saw Dan Santini,
and I couldn't take it.

1064
01:27:45,894 --> 01:27:48,464
What does Dan Santini
have to do with anything?

1065
01:27:48,497 --> 01:27:51,300
Oh, come on, Trish.
He's a big honcho with the mob.

1066
01:27:51,334 --> 01:27:53,336
Gregg used to call him
Mr. Main Event.

1067
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:54,703
And I'll tell you something

1068
01:27:54,737 --> 01:27:56,839
I know it was him who done Gregg in.
I could feel it in my gut.

1069
01:28:00,476 --> 01:28:02,978
Did I... Did I leave a picture
of me and Gregg here?

1070
01:28:03,011 --> 01:28:06,081
I was thinking maybe I'd give it
to his folks. I don't know though.

1071
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,784
Maybe it'd make 'em feel bad.
What do you think?

1072
01:28:08,817 --> 01:28:11,354
Oh, I think it...

1073
01:28:11,387 --> 01:28:14,056
I think they might feel bad for the moment,
but...

1074
01:28:14,089 --> 01:28:16,759
Later I think
they'd be glad to have it.

1075
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:22,565
Don't you think
you oughta go see them?

1076
01:28:22,598 --> 01:28:26,301
I mean, there must be something we can do.
I don't know.

1077
01:28:29,405 --> 01:28:31,540
How's his leg?

1078
01:28:31,574 --> 01:28:33,075
He's fine.
Just leave this off.

1079
01:28:35,378 --> 01:28:38,080
We're talking about
everything except us. Why?

1080
01:28:41,817 --> 01:28:43,852
Look, I don't want
to hurt you,

1081
01:28:43,886 --> 01:28:45,954
but there is no "us"
anymore.

1082
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:47,790
I've been tryin' to think
of a way to tell you,

1083
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:51,494
but there's really no better way
than just to tell you flat out.

1084
01:28:51,527 --> 01:28:53,429
I'm splittin'.

1085
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:56,999
I mean, let's face facts.

1086
01:28:57,032 --> 01:28:59,702
It wouldn't have
worked out. Right?

1087
01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:02,004
I mean, no way.

1088
01:29:02,037 --> 01:29:04,473
You were out of my reach
right from the start.

1089
01:29:04,507 --> 01:29:06,542
I mean,
who was I kiddin'? Huh?

1090
01:29:06,575 --> 01:29:08,577
I mean,
let's face facts.

1091
01:29:13,582 --> 01:29:16,652
And pretty soon,
you'll be old enough to be my grandmother.

1092
01:29:25,594 --> 01:29:27,129
I mean, nothin' ever
works out anyway, right?

1093
01:29:28,163 --> 01:29:31,066
So what's the point
anyway, huh?

1094
01:29:33,068 --> 01:29:34,970
That's why I'm leavin'.

1095
01:29:36,972 --> 01:29:39,174
Where will you go?

1096
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:42,711
I don't know. I was...
I was considerin' Vegas.

1097
01:29:42,745 --> 01:29:44,647
Yeah,
there's a lot of bread to be made in Vegas.

1098
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:48,584
And I'm not just talking tips.
I'm talking big bucks.

1099
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:51,587
That's if you get hooked up
with the right operation.

1100
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:54,523
There's no telling.
A person could get rich real quick there.

1101
01:29:54,557 --> 01:29:57,693
I always wanted to
get rich real quick.

1102
01:29:57,726 --> 01:30:00,763
Oh, then I met this lady
at a disco.

1103
01:30:00,796 --> 01:30:04,533
This real rich lady, and she asked me
if I'd go to Saint-Tropez with her.

1104
01:30:04,567 --> 01:30:07,102
Is that how you pronounce it?
Saint-Tropez?

1105
01:30:09,738 --> 01:30:11,440
Where is that?

1106
01:30:13,175 --> 01:30:15,544
Yeah, she didn't
know either.

1107
01:30:21,817 --> 01:30:23,051
What did you tell her?

1108
01:30:24,787 --> 01:30:26,489
Well, I told her...

1109
01:30:26,522 --> 01:30:30,559
I'd have to know where it was before I could
just pick up and leave town like that.

1110
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:34,429
Then I got offered
a movie... A porno.

1111
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,737
But I'll probably stick with Vegas, you know.
It's a better bet.

1112
01:30:49,845 --> 01:30:51,179
Why are you lookin'
at me like that?

1113
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:59,154
These things you're saying... You must be in
pain yourself to want to hurt me so much.

1114
01:31:07,195 --> 01:31:09,665
Hey, wait a minute.
Don't answer that.

1115
01:31:21,577 --> 01:31:23,512
Hello?

1116
01:31:23,546 --> 01:31:26,114
Trish?
What is it, Stu?

1117
01:31:26,148 --> 01:31:29,852
Look, I know you're upset about
what happened. I'm sorry.

1118
01:31:29,885 --> 01:31:31,119
I'm upset, too.

1119
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:33,055
I was thinking...

1120
01:31:33,088 --> 01:31:35,558
What about
my driving out tonight?

1121
01:31:35,591 --> 01:31:38,226
I felt strange seeing you
at the gallery. I felt bad.

1122
01:31:39,294 --> 01:31:41,163
Yeah, so did I.

1123
01:31:41,196 --> 01:31:43,999
Can I come out?
No, not tonight. No.

1124
01:31:44,032 --> 01:31:45,200
Is he there?

1125
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:47,936
That's it, isn't it?

1126
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:49,572
What's got into you?

1127
01:31:49,605 --> 01:31:52,775
I couldn't believe my eyes.
I mean, everyone's talking.

1128
01:31:52,808 --> 01:31:54,009
How old is he anyway?

1129
01:31:55,678 --> 01:31:57,512
About Stacie's age, I'd say.

1130
01:31:59,648 --> 01:32:01,550
Okay.

1131
01:32:01,584 --> 01:32:04,620
So we've both gone off the deep end.
But it's worse for you.

1132
01:32:06,321 --> 01:32:07,522
For me, a woman.
That's what you mean.

1133
01:32:07,556 --> 01:32:10,192
Look, I can't talk to you tonight.
Let's talk tomorrow.

1134
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:14,096
Okay. Okay.

1135
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:40,088
Strip?

1136
01:32:42,024 --> 01:32:43,759
Strip!

1137
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:52,935
Strip!

1138
01:32:56,839 --> 01:32:57,906
Strip...

1139
01:33:27,002 --> 01:33:29,972
Shh.

1140
01:35:38,166 --> 01:35:40,035
Traffic is very light
this Labor Day.

1141
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:43,806
Looks like those who are going out of
town for the holiday have already gone.

1142
01:35:43,839 --> 01:35:47,442
Flying back to the valley from Malibu, we
can see the Ventura Freeway ahead of us now.

1143
01:35:47,475 --> 01:35:51,513
It's light and moving well. No problems that
we know of throughout the freeway system.

1144
01:35:51,546 --> 01:35:54,416
This is Pamela McGinnis,
Skywatch clear.

1145
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:48,871
Come on.

1146
01:38:59,301 --> 01:39:00,702
Strip?

1147
01:39:16,218 --> 01:39:18,420
I see you, uh...

1148
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:22,157
You still don't belong
to the auto club.

1149
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:24,626
How come you tracked me down here?
Didn't you think I'd be in Vegas?

1150
01:39:24,659 --> 01:39:26,728
No.
No?

1151
01:39:26,761 --> 01:39:28,696
I knew you'd be here.

1152
01:39:30,298 --> 01:39:32,734
I knew you'd want to
see Gregg's parents.

1153
01:39:34,202 --> 01:39:36,304
You left clues.

1154
01:39:37,439 --> 01:39:38,640
Here.

1155
01:39:42,177 --> 01:39:46,281
And, um, here.

1156
01:39:48,816 --> 01:39:50,418
Go on. Open it.

1157
01:39:50,452 --> 01:39:52,187
Go on.

1158
01:40:25,287 --> 01:40:27,355
Happy birthday.

1159
01:40:33,561 --> 01:40:35,463
You remembered.

1160
01:41:00,822 --> 01:41:03,458
* Though our love

1161
01:41:03,491 --> 01:41:07,462
* Is like a winding road

1162
01:41:07,495 --> 01:41:10,064
* Of uncertainty

1163
01:41:14,636 --> 01:41:18,640
* I long to trust your smile

1164
01:41:18,673 --> 01:41:22,344
* And all the ways you feel

1165
01:41:22,377 --> 01:41:26,881
* Touching me

1166
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:30,318
* Moment

1167
01:41:30,352 --> 01:41:33,888
* By moment

1168
01:41:33,921 --> 01:41:37,292
* Our lifetime

1169
01:41:37,325 --> 01:41:41,329
* Goes on

1170
01:41:41,363 --> 01:41:44,466
* Till one day

1171
01:41:44,499 --> 01:41:48,370
* Our somedays

1172
01:41:48,403 --> 01:41:51,773
* Are gone

1173
01:41:56,511 --> 01:41:58,713
* Look at us

1174
01:41:58,746 --> 01:42:02,650
* Two drifters with a dream

1175
01:42:02,684 --> 01:42:07,155
* Scared to see it through

1176
01:42:09,391 --> 01:42:13,528
* But we're so happy now

1177
01:42:13,561 --> 01:42:17,232
* It might be beautiful

1178
01:42:17,265 --> 01:42:21,536
* If we do

1179
01:42:21,569 --> 01:42:24,506
* Moment

1180
01:42:24,539 --> 01:42:27,642
* By moment

1181
01:42:28,743 --> 01:42:31,579
* The choices

1182
01:42:31,613 --> 01:42:34,416
* We make

1183
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:38,853
* Depend on

1184
01:42:38,886 --> 01:42:42,324
* The chances

1185
01:42:42,357 --> 01:42:45,493
* We take

1186
