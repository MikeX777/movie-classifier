1
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,846
AFGHANISTAN, 1981

2
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:16,182
THE SECOND YEAR
OF THE RUSSIAN INVASION

3
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:08,386
Spread out.

4
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:10,221
Spread out.

5
00:06:10,925 --> 00:06:12,119
Move it.

6
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:16,362
Get your weapon on, Golikov.

7
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:38,712
Over here.

8
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:47,991
Kaminski.

9
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:01,734
T5447, what's your status?

10
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,601
Just mopping up, sir. Almost done.

11
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:07,510
Rejoin the column. All units rejoin.

12
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:09,077
I got 'em.

13
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,314
-Did you get the sheep over there?
-Let's say there's a couple left.

14
00:07:13,988 --> 00:07:15,421
T5447, Roger, six.

15
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:19,056
Behind this one building....

16
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:22,018
Sir. Gotta shoot it?

17
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:24,254
Give me the flamethrower.

18
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,532
-What you got?
-There you go, sir.

19
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:32,663
-Over this way.
-On my way.

20
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:35,037
-Golikov, come on.
-I'm coming.

21
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:36,701
Bring that cyanide canister.

22
00:07:36,878 --> 00:07:39,938
Where's the extra satchels?
Bring 'em over here.

23
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:41,848
Molotov.

24
00:07:44,052 --> 00:07:46,850
Look out at your sides.
There's another at your six.

25
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:48,755
Oh, my God.

26
00:07:51,893 --> 00:07:53,417
I'm burning!

27
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,660
Right there.

28
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:05,067
Oh, God.

29
00:08:05,473 --> 00:08:06,240
I can't put it out.

30
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,264
I can't put it out.

31
00:08:25,126 --> 00:08:27,287
-You owe me one.
-Get him over here.

32
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:29,726
Come on, get his arm. Come on.

33
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:32,032
Move it!

34
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:35,994
You son of a bitch!

35
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:38,133
You're dead!

36
00:08:49,183 --> 00:08:51,481
Put him under the track.

37
00:08:59,327 --> 00:09:01,158
Put your feet under there.

38
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:03,430
Do you want me to kick him?

39
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:06,428
You think you can kill my friends
and get away with it?

40
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,658
Koverchenko, mount and crank it up.

41
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:11,296
We're gonna squash you like a grape.

42
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:13,901
Ask him where the other rebels are.

43
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:19,207
Where are the rebels?

44
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,539
Mujahedeen are all around you!

45
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:25,810
Ten Russian dogs will die for every Afghan!

46
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,446
What did he say?

47
00:09:27,922 --> 00:09:29,787
He does not know, sir.

48
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,692
Tell them to stop.

49
00:09:36,197 --> 00:09:37,164
No further!

50
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,389
Let him go!

51
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:42,930
Sherina! I order you away from here!

52
00:09:48,776 --> 00:09:51,540
This commander prefers bullets
to words. Go!

53
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:54,406
Traitor!

54
00:09:54,982 --> 00:09:58,918
Tell your shit eater of a
commander to let him go!

55
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:04,518
These women,
they humbly beg you for the prisoner, sir.

56
00:10:07,595 --> 00:10:10,894
You tell them to watch
what happens to him.

57
00:10:13,935 --> 00:10:15,129
Do it.

58
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,109
He is to be my husband!

59
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,272
No Russian will escape Afghanistan!

60
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,512
Forward.

61
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:48,396
Forward!

62
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,339
Allah is the only God...!

63
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:31,002
-Direction, sir?
-Right fork.

64
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:33,008
-What?
-Right fork.

65
00:11:35,116 --> 00:11:36,344
Sir, are you sure?

66
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:39,247
Driver, I said, "Right fork. " Do you copy?

67
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,882
Yes, sir.

68
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:44,647
T5447, do you copy?

69
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:46,856
What's your position?

70
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:50,162
-Why can't they hear us?
-Do you copy?

71
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:52,093
T5447, do you copy?

72
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:55,134
T5447....

73
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:00,263
The tank is lost.

74
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:01,363
No...

75
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:03,276
We need help.

76
00:12:46,153 --> 00:12:47,450
Hasaad!

77
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:30,728
Taj...

78
00:13:32,133 --> 00:13:33,031
Uncle...

79
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:34,568
Come on.

80
00:13:39,273 --> 00:13:40,706
Uncle...why?

81
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:43,173
Retaliation.

82
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:15,631
Be his mother.

83
00:14:21,682 --> 00:14:22,910
Sherina.

84
00:14:40,034 --> 00:14:41,001
Moustafa!

85
00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:53,240
Salaam, Taj Mohamed.

86
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:05,957
Cousin, truce.

87
00:15:06,393 --> 00:15:07,519
Greetings, uncle.

88
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:08,787
Salaam, Moustafa.

89
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:21,602
I always said, have faith in
Allah and keep a hidden pistol.

90
00:15:22,743 --> 00:15:24,973
Every part of me screams
to see your blood.

91
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,906
Nothing has changed between us, then.

92
00:15:29,283 --> 00:15:32,878
Taj, your father would never
dishonor a truce.

93
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:34,783
What do you want here?

94
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,259
One of the tanks that killed your people
is lost in the valley of the Jackal.

95
00:15:42,496 --> 00:15:44,657
I know that valley.

96
00:15:45,332 --> 00:15:48,859
It only has one way in and out.

97
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,965
I come to call upon your
honor to avenge Afghanistan.

98
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,733
When Moustafa talks of honor...

99
00:15:57,211 --> 00:15:59,805
...the end of the world is at hand.

100
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:04,507
Cousin, uncle, we are tired
of this ancient vendetta.

101
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:07,683
Let us take revenge together...
We divide the booty.

102
00:16:10,558 --> 00:16:14,858
I will not fight with a scavenger...

103
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:18,594
...who picks gold from the
teeth of dead Russians.

104
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:22,493
Then run to Pakistan.

105
00:16:23,337 --> 00:16:25,237
I would speak with the Khan.

106
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:28,869
My father was killed.

107
00:16:30,211 --> 00:16:32,702
My brother Shahzaman is now Khan.

108
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:36,945
Your brother was martyred
by a Russian tank.

109
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,089
You are now Khan, Taj Mohamed.

110
00:16:55,936 --> 00:16:57,062
Shahzaman.

111
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,071
My Khan, we would fight with
you to avenge Shahzaman.

112
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:12,816
With this we can destroy the tank!

113
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:14,611
I know how to work it!

114
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,957
What do you say, Taj?

115
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:25,890
Your brother did not go to
Pakistan...He went to Paradise.

116
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:37,271
Allah...

117
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:42,204
Give me a man to tear apart.

118
00:17:43,017 --> 00:17:45,508
From this time forth...

119
00:17:46,053 --> 00:17:48,988
...I am a stone in your sling!

120
00:17:49,957 --> 00:17:51,447
Revenge!

121
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,463
Sir, I can't seem to raise them.

122
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:47,208
Scared as shit!

123
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:48,509
Come on!

124
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:50,946
Got any of that splash on you?

125
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,114
Sir.

126
00:18:57,191 --> 00:18:58,556
Where the hell are we?

127
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,217
I don't know, sir.

128
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:03,490
How do we get to Kandahar Road?

129
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:05,224
I'm not sure, sir.

130
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,362
The Molotov took our radio out.

131
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:10,264
We get reception but no transmission, sir.

132
00:19:19,313 --> 00:19:21,213
Those hills must be here.

133
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:25,743
Kandahar Road is on the other side
of those hills?

134
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:29,619
I'm not sure. The grid coordinates
are 31 degrees latitude--

135
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,215
Samad, you're relieved of your post.

136
00:19:32,426 --> 00:19:33,950
Give the log to Koverchenko.

137
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:37,019
-For what reason?
-lncompetence. Record it.

138
00:19:37,264 --> 00:19:38,856
-What is my function?
-None.

139
00:19:39,099 --> 00:19:41,727
Give yourself a battlefield commendation.

140
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:44,999
-For what, sir?
-For trying to save those tankers.

141
00:19:47,074 --> 00:19:48,541
To your post!

142
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,881
Just say, "Yes, sir,"
and keep out of his way.

143
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:57,108
Okay.

144
00:19:57,651 --> 00:20:00,415
Why did that rebel we ran over
laugh at me?

145
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:02,853
He wasn't laughing at you, he was happy.

146
00:20:02,956 --> 00:20:06,255
Such men believe if they die in a Holy War,
they will go to Paradise.

147
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,260
Do you believe that?

148
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,722
After university,
I'm not sure what I believe.

149
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:33,385
I need a woman!

150
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:36,420
Maybe you'll find another sheep.

151
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,855
Maybe I will.

152
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:39,916
Kaminski, turn that music off.

153
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:41,893
Golikov put it on, sir.

154
00:20:42,896 --> 00:20:44,625
Kaminski, you shit!

155
00:20:49,803 --> 00:20:52,966
Come here for a second.
I've got something to show you.

156
00:21:07,488 --> 00:21:08,887
Crank it up!

157
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:11,987
Gunner.

158
00:21:14,228 --> 00:21:16,196
Troops on the ridge!

159
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,824
Turret power.

160
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,638
Range.

161
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:29,671
Three-zero-zero.

162
00:21:32,412 --> 00:21:33,640
At my command.

163
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:35,371
What's around?

164
00:21:35,749 --> 00:21:37,478
Get it out of here.

165
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,614
Ready to roll.

166
00:21:41,688 --> 00:21:43,349
Driver. Forward. Go!

167
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:49,090
Frag!

168
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:50,988
Heads up, Samad.

169
00:21:51,398 --> 00:21:52,330
Traversing.

170
00:21:59,072 --> 00:21:59,766
Up.

171
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,069
Fire.

172
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:03,569
On the way.

173
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,028
Let's go!

174
00:22:29,836 --> 00:22:30,962
Moustafa.

175
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:36,576
You said you could kill the tank
in one shot!

176
00:22:37,044 --> 00:22:38,568
Maybe it is not the will of Allah.

177
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:42,674
Or maybe you are a bad shot!

178
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:44,648
I am Khan!

179
00:22:45,052 --> 00:22:47,486
I demand to be the one
to explode the tank!

180
00:22:48,488 --> 00:22:50,513
Give me the RPG!

181
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:53,819
Your nephew is a hothead, uncle.

182
00:22:55,829 --> 00:22:57,091
Moustafa.

183
00:23:02,536 --> 00:23:04,561
We all stay together!

184
00:23:04,805 --> 00:23:05,794
Taj.

185
00:23:06,373 --> 00:23:08,773
Who calls himself Khan is not a Khan.

186
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:10,703
Patience, Taj.

187
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:12,401
This is your trial.

188
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,348
Uncle?

189
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:21,313
It's nothing. A scratch.

190
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:25,058
Come...

191
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,523
Allah gives us tracks to follow.

192
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,660
Khanzaman! Afzal! Come on!

193
00:25:08,795 --> 00:25:11,286
Only one drank the water,
goddamnit. Samad!

194
00:25:11,364 --> 00:25:13,559
I told you to throw the canister far away.

195
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:14,998
They found it.

196
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:17,896
At my command, gunner. Frag.

197
00:25:18,939 --> 00:25:19,928
Move.

198
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:21,601
Move it.

199
00:25:24,578 --> 00:25:25,704
Frag is up.

200
00:25:26,113 --> 00:25:27,774
-Fire.
-On the way.

201
00:25:30,417 --> 00:25:31,509
Misfire.

202
00:25:32,085 --> 00:25:33,313
Go to manual.

203
00:25:36,323 --> 00:25:37,415
Misfire.

204
00:25:37,524 --> 00:25:39,116
Out of the tank!

205
00:26:00,914 --> 00:26:02,677
-What happened?
-Misfire.

206
00:26:02,749 --> 00:26:04,717
I know it's gonna blow.

207
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:07,245
The shell looked okay to me.

208
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:10,753
-Samad.
-Yes, sir?

209
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:12,824
Did you touch that shell?

210
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,122
Yes, sir.

211
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:18,830
I just handed it....
I handed it to Golikov, sir.

212
00:26:19,065 --> 00:26:20,259
That's all.

213
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:23,598
Misfires happen, sir.
One in every 100 rounds.

214
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:25,332
Cook-off.

215
00:26:29,242 --> 00:26:32,075
It's the loader's responsibility to unload.

216
00:26:32,846 --> 00:26:34,074
Golikov.

217
00:26:37,684 --> 00:26:40,517
Sir, I've never handled a cook-off before.

218
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,051
I will do it, sir.

219
00:26:47,661 --> 00:26:50,425
He doesn't know what he's doing.
Let me go in there.

220
00:26:55,969 --> 00:26:57,095
All right.

221
00:26:57,337 --> 00:26:58,599
-Kaminski.
-Sir?

222
00:26:58,872 --> 00:27:00,601
Pinpoint the Mujas.

223
00:27:01,107 --> 00:27:03,701
-Don't take your eyes off them.
-Yes, sir.

224
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:05,709
Koverchenko. Golikov.

225
00:27:25,232 --> 00:27:26,790
Come on.

226
00:27:56,029 --> 00:27:58,259
Sir, maybe I ought to do this.

227
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:00,332
What if something happens?

228
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:05,001
Then Kaminski will have his first command.

229
00:28:11,077 --> 00:28:13,511
Just tell me one thing, Koverchenko.

230
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:17,072
Why do you stick up for the Afghan?

231
00:28:18,084 --> 00:28:20,279
Because he's doing his best, sir.

232
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:23,121
That's what worries me.

233
00:28:26,826 --> 00:28:29,522
You've got what it takes. I've seen it.

234
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,764
Keep your head on straight.

235
00:28:37,704 --> 00:28:39,729
Why don't we turn and fight the rebels?

236
00:28:39,806 --> 00:28:43,970
'Cause they could put a fucking hole
right through us with that RPG.

237
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:03,852
Come on, go.

238
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:08,395
Come on.

239
00:29:09,302 --> 00:29:11,998
-What the hell happened?
-They're gone, sir.

240
00:29:12,072 --> 00:29:14,597
Lucky bastards don't know
Samad saved their lives.

241
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:16,471
I didn't do anything.

242
00:29:19,913 --> 00:29:21,847
Booby trap that round.

243
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:23,807
Come on.

244
00:29:23,883 --> 00:29:25,646
Driver, crank it up.

245
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:32,452
Careful.

246
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:40,928
Get us out of here.

247
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:42,633
Moving tank.

248
00:30:34,621 --> 00:30:38,455
We bleed because we are weak
for Russian junk.

249
00:30:43,496 --> 00:30:46,158
Your mujahed has no chance to live.

250
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:50,864
Our uncle is wounded too.
Let him stay here with Noor.

251
00:30:51,838 --> 00:30:55,399
My wound will heal
when I see the tank explode.

252
00:30:56,876 --> 00:30:59,310
We leave him food and water.

253
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:33,803
God is great.

254
00:32:20,627 --> 00:32:21,924
Another grave.

255
00:32:24,531 --> 00:32:28,592
The wind covers the tank tracks...
we want to return to the village.

256
00:32:28,668 --> 00:32:32,968
You have no village -- only "Badal"!

257
00:33:12,645 --> 00:33:14,169
A Holy Man.

258
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:27,516
David! You have come!

259
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:33,731
Prophet Mohamed bid me build
a fire to light your way.

260
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,631
God willing, with only a stone
you will slay The Beast, David!

261
00:33:39,439 --> 00:33:40,428
What Beast?

262
00:33:41,407 --> 00:33:42,533
Goliath!

263
00:33:45,578 --> 00:33:47,136
Look Taj... tank tracks!

264
00:34:10,336 --> 00:34:11,997
Build a fire, sir?

265
00:34:15,008 --> 00:34:17,738
I'm sure you lost those Muja-fucks, sir.

266
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:20,375
Tend to the track, Kaminski.

267
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,672
You got it, sir.

268
00:34:28,988 --> 00:34:30,216
Oh, God.

269
00:34:31,991 --> 00:34:33,856
Let me hit that thing.

270
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:38,322
It is called Pakhtunali.
It's the code of honor.

271
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:42,695
Three obligations.

272
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:46,032
First, "Milmastia," hospitality.

273
00:34:48,274 --> 00:34:51,437
Second, "Badal," revenge.

274
00:34:53,946 --> 00:34:56,278
Third, "Nanawatai."

275
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:00,886
The obligation to give sanctuary
to all those who ask.

276
00:35:02,188 --> 00:35:04,156
-To all?
-All.

277
00:35:04,657 --> 00:35:06,818
-Even the enemy?
-All.

278
00:35:09,028 --> 00:35:11,189
What if I kill your brother...

279
00:35:11,764 --> 00:35:14,631
...and you come for Badal, revenge?

280
00:35:15,268 --> 00:35:17,236
And I ask for Nanawatai?

281
00:35:18,137 --> 00:35:21,971
Then I would be obligated to feed,
clothe and protect you.

282
00:35:22,608 --> 00:35:24,701
That's incredibly civilized.

283
00:35:25,978 --> 00:35:27,673
What is it, Nanawatai?

284
00:35:31,984 --> 00:35:33,008
Bread?

285
00:35:41,361 --> 00:35:45,024
Smells like he's been chewing
on fucking buffalo shit.

286
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,764
When we get back,
you gotta transfer out of this tank.

287
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,535
I'll win his respect in time.

288
00:35:55,608 --> 00:35:57,303
Listen to me.

289
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:00,679
When he gets on your back
there's no way to shake him.

290
00:36:00,847 --> 00:36:02,576
My dear Konstantin.

291
00:36:02,749 --> 00:36:06,116
I regard this abuse
as the price I must pay to learn.

292
00:36:07,086 --> 00:36:11,614
I love Afghanistan,
but we are a flea in the tail of a bear.

293
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:14,954
We must join the 20th century.

294
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:19,057
And when Afghans accept that,
I will be there.

295
00:36:19,632 --> 00:36:22,100
Knowing technology and Russian.

296
00:36:22,535 --> 00:36:25,003
-So, you're a patriot?
-Yes.

297
00:36:25,571 --> 00:36:26,765
So was that rebel.

298
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:29,875
He wanted to keep things
the way they've always been.

299
00:36:29,942 --> 00:36:32,172
I wish I believed in something that much.

300
00:36:32,311 --> 00:36:33,676
I envy him.

301
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:36,540
Then why did you crush him?

302
00:36:37,316 --> 00:36:39,079
Because I had no choice.

303
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:41,854
-You always have a choice.
-Give it.

304
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:44,116
You never told me
she sent nudes of herself.

305
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:45,919
Give it to me.

306
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:48,952
She's got that nympho look.

307
00:36:51,898 --> 00:36:53,866
I got the half I want.

308
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,073
You son of a bitch.

309
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:03,971
Get the fuck off me.

310
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:09,544
-What the hell is going on?
-Nothing, sir.

311
00:37:15,288 --> 00:37:17,017
Thanks, Konstantin.

312
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,267
What is this?

313
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,337
Brake fluid!

314
00:37:35,408 --> 00:37:37,433
No wonder they don't work.

315
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:40,472
It keeps me steady on the gun, sir.

316
00:37:40,546 --> 00:37:43,208
I filter it through bread,
and get out all the shit.

317
00:37:43,282 --> 00:37:46,251
Then I put in raisins and sugar,
I put it out in the sun.

318
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:48,844
It ferments in a few days.
Gets a pretty good kick.

319
00:37:53,759 --> 00:37:55,317
Write him up, sir?

320
00:37:55,428 --> 00:37:56,918
Get over here.

321
00:38:01,734 --> 00:38:03,326
For one mistake?

322
00:38:03,603 --> 00:38:05,833
He's the best gunner in the division.

323
00:38:06,038 --> 00:38:07,266
Omit it.

324
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:09,939
It's already done, sir. In ink.

325
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,276
You'd better watch your ass from now on.

326
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:58,712
Sometimes Afghan snipers
pick off tank drivers.

327
00:38:59,992 --> 00:39:02,358
Sometimes tank drivers pick 'em off first.

328
00:39:05,665 --> 00:39:06,654
Grenade!

329
00:39:08,568 --> 00:39:09,933
Get down!

330
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,068
Shit.

331
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:25,480
Don't blow it up!

332
00:39:25,985 --> 00:39:28,317
Kill the Russians underneath, not the tank!

333
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:32,855
Grenade!

334
00:39:37,797 --> 00:39:38,855
Open the hatch.

335
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:41,329
We're getting slaughtered down here.

336
00:39:41,601 --> 00:39:43,034
Open the hatch.

337
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:45,203
I'm bleeding.

338
00:39:51,877 --> 00:39:52,866
Inside.

339
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:54,103
Get inside.

340
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,510
Get in the tank. Hurry up!

341
00:40:00,353 --> 00:40:03,083
Koverchenko, get us the hell outta here.

342
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:04,918
Hurry up!

343
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,428
We've got a fire on top.

344
00:40:10,096 --> 00:40:12,030
-I'm dying!
-I can't see.

345
00:40:12,098 --> 00:40:13,087
I'm dying!

346
00:40:13,265 --> 00:40:14,596
Hard right!

347
00:40:18,204 --> 00:40:20,069
Gunner, traverse right, 180.

348
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:24,509
I'm dying!

349
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,470
Traversing.

350
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:30,849
I can't see through the fire, sir!

351
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:44,188
Gunner, identify.

352
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,689
Bead on the fire of our campsite!

353
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:48,697
I can't get elevation.

354
00:41:59,605 --> 00:42:02,438
We can detect anything
in 100 meter radius.

355
00:42:04,543 --> 00:42:07,944
They must have camels.
That's got to be how they're keeping up.

356
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,375
I can't believe how bad
they want this tank.

357
00:42:10,449 --> 00:42:12,781
-They just keep coming.
-Shut up.

358
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:17,980
How much longer do we stay here?

359
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:21,959
Till first light when we can see
where we're going.

360
00:42:22,128 --> 00:42:23,390
Crack the hatch, sir?

361
00:42:23,462 --> 00:42:24,326
No.

362
00:42:25,164 --> 00:42:26,461
Sir, I have to piss.

363
00:42:26,766 --> 00:42:27,733
Hold it.

364
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:30,968
Do we have any water, Samad?

365
00:42:31,771 --> 00:42:35,104
All the canteens were left behind.
All the rations, too.

366
00:42:35,508 --> 00:42:36,839
Great.

367
00:42:37,076 --> 00:42:39,135
Your pals will feast tonight.

368
00:42:39,612 --> 00:42:42,604
We don't need food and water.
We're safe in here.

369
00:42:46,752 --> 00:42:49,346
My tanks have been hit by everything.

370
00:42:50,689 --> 00:42:53,157
In Mongolia once....

371
00:42:54,193 --> 00:42:57,094
RPG. Direct hit.

372
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,833
Commander, gunner and turret went flying.

373
00:43:12,344 --> 00:43:15,336
I drove the rest of the tank
back to our lines.

374
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:20,647
These tanks today are better.

375
00:43:21,887 --> 00:43:23,479
Much better.

376
00:43:36,101 --> 00:43:38,296
I don't think I can hold it much longer.

377
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:39,469
Sir!

378
00:43:41,807 --> 00:43:43,536
-How many?
-20, 25.

379
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:45,167
They're all around us.

380
00:43:45,244 --> 00:43:46,575
Battle stations!

381
00:43:46,645 --> 00:43:49,546
Wait. I don't think they see us,
the way they're moving.

382
00:43:49,615 --> 00:43:51,480
They're in effective RPG range.

383
00:43:52,117 --> 00:43:53,641
Gunner, troops, frag.

384
00:43:53,886 --> 00:43:55,183
Frag is up, sir.

385
00:43:55,254 --> 00:43:56,050
Identify.

386
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:58,487
I can't identify, it's too dark.

387
00:44:02,194 --> 00:44:03,024
Go to lR.

388
00:44:03,095 --> 00:44:04,187
IR is busted.

389
00:44:04,263 --> 00:44:06,163
They're all around us, sir.

390
00:44:07,299 --> 00:44:09,233
Stand by to traverse left, 360.

391
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:11,799
All weapons fire at my command.

392
00:44:12,905 --> 00:44:14,736
Traverse. Fire!

393
00:44:22,781 --> 00:44:23,440
Up.

394
00:44:29,655 --> 00:44:31,213
Cease fire!

395
00:44:39,131 --> 00:44:40,189
All dead, sir.

396
00:44:49,108 --> 00:44:49,904
Samad.

397
00:44:51,176 --> 00:44:52,507
Go verify.

398
00:44:57,616 --> 00:44:59,049
-Move it.
-Yes, sir.

399
00:45:28,147 --> 00:45:29,944
Kaminski, stand down.

400
00:45:35,988 --> 00:45:37,922
Koverchenko, get on the co-ax.

401
00:45:46,065 --> 00:45:47,555
Set Samad in your sights.

402
00:45:47,967 --> 00:45:48,934
What?

403
00:45:49,435 --> 00:45:51,027
Take him now, he's a traitor.

404
00:45:55,107 --> 00:45:56,404
Are you insane?

405
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:00,873
Your insubordination has gotten you
demoted from lntelligence...

406
00:46:00,946 --> 00:46:04,814
...to Rescue Operations, to this tank.
Your next stop is prison.

407
00:46:05,517 --> 00:46:09,146
With a record like that,
I wouldn't disobey another order.

408
00:46:11,323 --> 00:46:12,517
Take Samad, now.

409
00:46:19,865 --> 00:46:21,389
No.

410
00:46:31,343 --> 00:46:32,833
How many dead?

411
00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:34,671
It's deer, sir.

412
00:46:37,416 --> 00:46:39,043
It's a herd of deer.

413
00:46:56,435 --> 00:46:59,495
The Russian kills just to kill.

414
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:16,219
We're leaking oil, sir.

415
00:47:16,588 --> 00:47:19,955
-Raise the snorkel and seal the cannon.
-Are we going under water?

416
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:23,492
There are rebels behind us
and they're following our tracks.

417
00:48:20,853 --> 00:48:22,753
Samad, stop it.

418
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:27,950
I'm in my prayers, sir.

419
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:29,256
Get up.

420
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:36,256
Sir.

421
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:41,227
If I'm able to reconcile
dialectical materialism and Allah...

422
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,674
...isn't that my business?

423
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:47,571
Why do you not trust me, sir?

424
00:48:48,413 --> 00:48:50,881
You know I'm a member of the Party.

425
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,948
My son is in the cultural exchange
in Moscow.

426
00:48:54,052 --> 00:48:56,350
Do you think I would compromise my son?

427
00:48:56,722 --> 00:48:58,019
I said, "Get up."

428
00:49:03,095 --> 00:49:05,063
See how deep the river is.

429
00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:07,795
How, sir?

430
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:10,866
Walk in it.

431
00:49:21,046 --> 00:49:22,809
You don't need that.

432
00:49:39,598 --> 00:49:41,429
Like ice, sir.

433
00:49:42,134 --> 00:49:44,227
I didn't ask for the temperature.

434
00:49:46,638 --> 00:49:48,731
Is the bottom mud or stone?

435
00:49:51,176 --> 00:49:52,336
Stone.

436
00:49:57,316 --> 00:49:58,340
No!

437
00:50:06,725 --> 00:50:07,783
Why?

438
00:50:08,327 --> 00:50:10,192
-I said, "Why?"
-Shut up!

439
00:50:15,968 --> 00:50:17,435
What are you doing?

440
00:50:17,669 --> 00:50:18,727
Recording, sir.

441
00:50:18,804 --> 00:50:22,706
Write yourself up. This time your
insubordination's got you a court-martial.

442
00:50:22,774 --> 00:50:25,368
So will killing your own men, sir!

443
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,432
If you were commander,
you would've done the same thing.

444
00:50:50,636 --> 00:50:54,766
Samad was waiting for his chance
to deliver this tank to the enemy.

445
00:50:57,976 --> 00:51:00,001
But I was too smart for him.

446
00:51:01,013 --> 00:51:03,208
And I didn't study philosophy.

447
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:07,182
I read your dossier, Mr. Intellectual.

448
00:51:07,919 --> 00:51:10,547
What would you say
your record says about you?

449
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:13,517
That I think for myself.

450
00:51:16,995 --> 00:51:18,895
You think for yourself.

451
00:51:20,132 --> 00:51:24,694
When I was eight years old defending
Stalingrad, I didn't think for myself.

452
00:51:25,103 --> 00:51:27,901
When the Motherland asked for our lives,
we gave.

453
00:51:28,073 --> 00:51:30,906
My father didn't think of himself, he gave.

454
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:33,134
My mother didn't think of herself,
she gave.

455
00:51:33,211 --> 00:51:36,112
My brother didn't think of himself, he gave.

456
00:51:38,116 --> 00:51:42,450
My comrades tied a rope around my waist
and lowered me on top of Nazi tanks.

457
00:51:42,654 --> 00:51:45,646
I stuffed Molotovs under turret and cannon.

458
00:51:46,758 --> 00:51:49,750
And they pulled me up again.
Eight years old.

459
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:54,623
They called me Tank Boy.

460
00:51:57,369 --> 00:51:59,462
I took a lot of Nazi tanks.

461
00:52:02,274 --> 00:52:03,104
A lot.

462
00:52:06,812 --> 00:52:09,906
Over the years,
I've learned to smell a traitor.

463
00:52:52,657 --> 00:52:55,091
-How bad is it?
-You mean the tank?

464
00:52:57,229 --> 00:52:59,857
Konstantin, do you think he's snapped?

465
00:53:01,533 --> 00:53:03,763
-What are you doing?
-What?

466
00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:06,599
You wanna be next?
Don't be seen talking to this asshole.

467
00:53:07,139 --> 00:53:08,470
How much further can we go?

468
00:53:08,907 --> 00:53:10,431
Not far enough.

469
00:53:10,609 --> 00:53:12,702
We should just ditch this bitch...

470
00:53:12,944 --> 00:53:16,209
...dismantle the dosh gun,
fucking walk to Kandahar Road.

471
00:53:16,581 --> 00:53:18,811
What are you whispering about?

472
00:53:23,388 --> 00:53:25,652
Kaminski had an interesting idea, sir.

473
00:53:27,325 --> 00:53:29,555
Ditching the tank and walking back.

474
00:53:31,563 --> 00:53:33,190
He's a fucking liar, sir!

475
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:39,664
As a man who thinks for himself,
Koverchenko, what do you think?

476
00:53:42,841 --> 00:53:45,674
Well, sir, the road wheel's cracked.

477
00:53:46,077 --> 00:53:49,137
Kaminski drank our brakes.
We're low on petrol.

478
00:53:49,247 --> 00:53:51,772
The battery's low, we're losing oil.

479
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,884
If the engine heats up, it'll seize.

480
00:53:53,952 --> 00:53:57,149
Terrain, obviously against us.
We have no rations.

481
00:53:57,222 --> 00:54:01,181
The Mujas don't seem to need rations,
petrol or anything we know of and...

482
00:54:01,326 --> 00:54:02,816
...they have an RPG.

483
00:54:04,663 --> 00:54:06,858
Their aim is getting better, sir.

484
00:54:09,701 --> 00:54:11,498
You admire them, don't you?

485
00:54:13,004 --> 00:54:14,972
They've got us on the run, don't they?

486
00:54:15,574 --> 00:54:17,974
What do you suggest? Surrender?

487
00:54:23,615 --> 00:54:27,073
Clearly, that's a direct violation
of Soviet military law.

488
00:54:27,919 --> 00:54:30,353
But you're all for it, aren't you?

489
00:54:30,622 --> 00:54:32,613
That's mutiny, Koverchenko.

490
00:54:36,795 --> 00:54:37,989
Try it.

491
00:54:39,064 --> 00:54:41,658
Kaminski, get his weapon. Cover him.

492
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:43,229
Yes, sir.

493
00:54:43,802 --> 00:54:45,702
Golikov, get some rope.

494
00:54:52,377 --> 00:54:53,435
Now!

495
00:54:56,414 --> 00:54:57,616
Tie him to that rock.

496
00:54:57,616 --> 00:54:58,207
Tie him to that rock.

497
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:01,715
I'll haunt you, Kaminski.
I'll be your worst nightmare.

498
00:55:01,786 --> 00:55:03,014
Shut up.

499
00:55:03,922 --> 00:55:05,321
You hear me?

500
00:55:06,992 --> 00:55:09,552
-Be an idiot.
-I don't believe this.

501
00:55:10,762 --> 00:55:12,389
Hold still, asshole.

502
00:55:12,497 --> 00:55:14,590
-What are we doing?
-You shut up!

503
00:55:16,535 --> 00:55:18,594
He fucking stepped in this one himself.

504
00:55:18,703 --> 00:55:20,170
You're a fucking lackey!

505
00:55:21,339 --> 00:55:22,203
Fuck.

506
00:55:23,108 --> 00:55:25,235
-Get the log book.
-Yes, sir.

507
00:55:26,711 --> 00:55:29,874
He doesn't have it, sir.
He must've left it in the tank.

508
00:55:29,948 --> 00:55:31,347
Booby trap him.

509
00:55:33,552 --> 00:55:36,112
Twisted, insane. Don't be an idiot.

510
00:55:36,187 --> 00:55:37,620
Don't move.

511
00:55:43,628 --> 00:55:45,528
If you need anything...

512
00:55:45,664 --> 00:55:47,063
...just nod.

513
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,475
Konstantin, I'm sorry.

514
00:56:01,713 --> 00:56:03,578
Anton, you're next.

515
00:56:04,449 --> 00:56:08,044
Go to the tank, blow his brains out,
come back and untie me.

516
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,317
-You're next.
-I can't.

517
00:56:10,455 --> 00:56:11,979
You hear me?

518
00:56:12,223 --> 00:56:15,124
Anton, don't leave me here. Don't leave.

519
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,093
-I can't.
-Untie me.

520
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:20,989
You're a good soldier.

521
00:56:21,066 --> 00:56:24,524
You can be counted on
when they ask you to shoot your mother.

522
00:56:24,669 --> 00:56:26,796
Golikov! Goddamnit.

523
00:56:31,843 --> 00:56:33,868
Don't leave me here, you coward.

524
00:56:35,447 --> 00:56:37,108
Golikov, you fuck.

525
00:57:09,748 --> 00:57:11,909
I think you did the right thing, sir.

526
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:14,243
I appreciate that, Kaminski.

527
00:57:14,886 --> 00:57:18,151
I think I speak for all of us when I say that.

528
00:57:20,392 --> 00:57:24,590
What he wrote in here could
close doors for the rest of your lives.

529
00:57:25,897 --> 00:57:28,627
I don't know why you
didn't just kill him, sir.

530
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:31,458
I was trying to buy us some time.

531
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:38,602
The tank's roomier now.

532
00:57:54,926 --> 00:57:55,893
Sherina!

533
00:57:56,895 --> 00:57:58,886
What are you doing here?

534
00:58:03,301 --> 00:58:07,260
Akbar, we would fight the tank with you.

535
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:09,897
You have no weapons.

536
00:58:21,319 --> 00:58:24,117
Get back to the village, woman!... Go!

537
00:59:49,007 --> 00:59:49,701
Uncle...

538
00:59:52,076 --> 00:59:53,907
...am I fit to be Khan?

539
00:59:56,548 --> 01:00:00,609
To ask that question makes you Khan.

540
01:00:10,228 --> 01:00:13,789
When The Beast is dead, we will return.

541
01:00:15,867 --> 01:00:17,630
I will be waiting.

542
01:01:15,693 --> 01:01:16,921
There it is.

543
01:01:17,161 --> 01:01:18,651
Kandahar Road.

544
01:01:29,274 --> 01:01:31,071
Kaminski, we're home.

545
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:40,881
Sir, we're almost out of petrol.

546
01:01:41,386 --> 01:01:43,115
Make it to the road.

547
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:46,354
Stop tank.

548
01:01:46,991 --> 01:01:48,618
-What?
-Stop tank.

549
01:01:49,193 --> 01:01:50,524
Stop tank.

550
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:01,970
I'm sure I can make it, it's only....

551
01:03:48,413 --> 01:03:49,573
Please.

552
01:03:52,984 --> 01:03:54,042
Untie my hands.

553
01:03:54,118 --> 01:03:57,884
Afghan women, turn your grief to stone!

554
01:04:01,492 --> 01:04:02,584
Stop.

555
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:10,894
Jesus!

556
01:04:11,202 --> 01:04:12,669
Please, stop!

557
01:04:14,272 --> 01:04:15,398
Nanawatai!

558
01:04:31,422 --> 01:04:33,049
Sherina, how did you find us?

559
01:04:33,391 --> 01:04:34,653
It was Allah's will...

560
01:04:34,725 --> 01:04:36,522
We found him tied to the rock.

561
01:04:38,329 --> 01:04:40,320
You take the honor, Taj.

562
01:04:40,665 --> 01:04:41,529
Nanawatai.

563
01:04:46,104 --> 01:04:47,036
Nanawatai.

564
01:04:47,205 --> 01:04:48,570
He asks for mercy.

565
01:04:49,307 --> 01:04:52,470
I teach you another word -- Badal!
Blood for blood!

566
01:04:53,244 --> 01:04:54,734
Silence, woman!

567
01:04:57,215 --> 01:04:58,341
You speak Afghan?

568
01:04:58,549 --> 01:04:59,413
Nanawatai.

569
01:05:01,252 --> 01:05:02,583
What is your name?

570
01:05:03,654 --> 01:05:04,586
Nanawatai.

571
01:05:04,889 --> 01:05:06,447
A crow can speak a word,

572
01:05:06,824 --> 01:05:09,952
...but a crow is not a man,
and neither is a Russian.

573
01:05:11,195 --> 01:05:12,492
Kill him!

574
01:05:13,531 --> 01:05:17,592
If we dishonor our code and slay him
we are no better than the infidels.

575
01:05:28,112 --> 01:05:30,910
...but why was he abandoned by the tank?

576
01:05:37,622 --> 01:05:38,850
Don't.

577
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:40,018
No.

578
01:06:19,864 --> 01:06:21,798
Nanawatai is for Afghans.

579
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:25,427
If he is an enemy of our enemy,
then he is a friend.

580
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:27,704
Let us look to our guest.

581
01:07:01,405 --> 01:07:02,167
Eat.

582
01:07:02,406 --> 01:07:03,566
Choke.

583
01:07:50,488 --> 01:07:52,649
You broke it when you dropped it.

584
01:07:53,457 --> 01:07:56,949
So? David took Goliath with just a stone.

585
01:08:20,685 --> 01:08:22,209
An RPG.

586
01:08:29,427 --> 01:08:30,792
It's kaput.

587
01:08:41,806 --> 01:08:42,864
Fix.

588
01:08:45,443 --> 01:08:46,740
I fix.

589
01:09:08,165 --> 01:09:09,325
Kaput.

590
01:09:13,971 --> 01:09:15,199
Enfield.

591
01:09:17,808 --> 01:09:20,299
I need Enfield to fix the RPG.

592
01:09:28,853 --> 01:09:30,047
Thanks.

593
01:09:58,549 --> 01:10:01,712
Now he has ruined two of our weapons!

594
01:10:48,132 --> 01:10:50,726
This one is truly sent from Allah!

595
01:11:03,347 --> 01:11:04,371
Exactly.

596
01:11:18,929 --> 01:11:20,419
That's a tank.

597
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,957
Tank.

598
01:11:22,967 --> 01:11:24,059
Tank.

599
01:11:24,869 --> 01:11:25,893
RPG.

600
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,270
Tank.

601
01:11:34,211 --> 01:11:35,803
RPG, kaboom tank.

602
01:11:41,952 --> 01:11:42,976
RPG...

603
01:11:43,888 --> 01:11:45,048
...kaboom...

604
01:11:45,422 --> 01:11:46,446
...tank.

605
01:11:48,792 --> 01:11:50,259
He's Russian!

606
01:11:50,995 --> 01:11:52,622
He knows how to use that...

607
01:11:53,397 --> 01:11:55,957
...and they tried to kill him.

608
01:12:01,038 --> 01:12:03,734
Kaboom tank.

609
01:12:39,443 --> 01:12:41,035
Yeah, I'll kaboom tank.

610
01:13:44,375 --> 01:13:45,364
Come on, man.

611
01:13:45,709 --> 01:13:48,234
Come on, get your shit. Let's go.

612
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,323
Hey, you guys.

613
01:14:06,764 --> 01:14:08,527
Where'd you guys come from?

614
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,090
This is beautiful.

615
01:14:11,502 --> 01:14:13,333
We are so glad to see you guys.

616
01:14:13,437 --> 01:14:14,802
My God.

617
01:14:23,447 --> 01:14:25,813
Looks like it's your lucky day.

618
01:14:25,983 --> 01:14:29,384
If we hadn't been looking for water,
we'd have never found you.

619
01:14:29,453 --> 01:14:33,219
Go ahead and climb aboard.
I'll call in for a strike on the tank.

620
01:14:34,958 --> 01:14:37,153
Nobody wastes my tank.

621
01:14:48,505 --> 01:14:49,802
Get back in the tank.

622
01:14:51,575 --> 01:14:52,405
What for?

623
01:14:53,177 --> 01:14:54,644
Because I said so.

624
01:14:56,914 --> 01:14:58,279
We're going home, sir.

625
01:14:59,883 --> 01:15:01,646
In the tank.

626
01:15:02,986 --> 01:15:06,547
Why can't we go home
in the fucking helicopter?

627
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:09,352
Because you're tankers.

628
01:15:10,594 --> 01:15:12,994
You're also in a cul-de-sac.

629
01:15:17,601 --> 01:15:19,831
There's only one way out of this valley.

630
01:15:20,003 --> 01:15:22,164
Back through that pass.

631
01:15:52,402 --> 01:15:54,370
We'll get back the same way we got in.

632
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:55,660
Shit.

633
01:16:00,043 --> 01:16:02,511
-Got any extra water?
-No.

634
01:16:02,713 --> 01:16:05,807
You two, load the extra fuel onto the tank.

635
01:16:05,883 --> 01:16:08,977
Radio for some more fuel
to meet us at the pass.

636
01:16:10,954 --> 01:16:12,649
Jesus, what an asshole.

637
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:50,350
What are we doing?

638
01:16:51,495 --> 01:16:53,520
Why don't we make a run for it?

639
01:16:53,864 --> 01:16:55,729
Are you fucking crazy?

640
01:16:56,099 --> 01:16:58,465
He'd shoot us right out of the sky.

641
01:17:59,129 --> 01:18:01,324
The tank is leaving!

642
01:18:02,566 --> 01:18:04,796
The pass... The pass!

643
01:18:05,102 --> 01:18:07,935
It's turning back for the pass!

644
01:18:10,007 --> 01:18:10,769
What?

645
01:18:11,475 --> 01:18:12,407
Tank.

646
01:18:12,609 --> 01:18:13,633
I know.

647
01:18:13,911 --> 01:18:15,469
-What?
-Tank.

648
01:18:29,826 --> 01:18:31,418
It's a dead end.

649
01:18:47,511 --> 01:18:48,603
The pass.

650
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:50,476
He's going to the pass.

651
01:18:50,547 --> 01:18:52,242
But why's he going to the pass?

652
01:18:52,549 --> 01:18:56,007
Why didn't he get in the helicopter?
The bastard won't leave his tank.

653
01:18:56,153 --> 01:18:58,747
Fucking bastard won't leave his tank.

654
01:19:03,627 --> 01:19:05,094
He's gone....

655
01:19:14,137 --> 01:19:15,468
Mountains.

656
01:19:19,810 --> 01:19:23,302
He's gotta go around to get to the pass.

657
01:19:30,821 --> 01:19:33,051
Short cut. You know a short cut?

658
01:19:33,123 --> 01:19:34,215
Tank.

659
01:19:35,759 --> 01:19:37,226
I understand.

660
01:19:41,665 --> 01:19:42,859
Konstantin.

661
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,865
Konstantin.

662
01:19:51,341 --> 01:19:53,741
Khan. Konstantin. Khan.

663
01:20:51,701 --> 01:20:53,532
Sir, the engine's hot.

664
01:20:54,538 --> 01:20:56,904
Maintain 20 kilometers an hour.

665
01:20:57,474 --> 01:20:59,942
Sir, the radiator needs water.

666
01:21:00,944 --> 01:21:02,377
Keep going.

667
01:21:02,612 --> 01:21:05,376
Goddamnit, sir,
the engine's gonna seize up!

668
01:21:06,349 --> 01:21:07,714
Keep going.

669
01:21:08,085 --> 01:21:10,053
The waterhole's not far.

670
01:22:09,146 --> 01:22:11,444
Do you think they radioed back?

671
01:22:12,682 --> 01:22:14,411
Of course they did.

672
01:22:18,155 --> 01:22:20,282
I hate this fucking country.

673
01:22:23,093 --> 01:22:24,754
Fill the radiator.

674
01:23:52,349 --> 01:23:53,145
Kaminski!

675
01:23:54,918 --> 01:23:56,146
Golikov.

676
01:23:58,455 --> 01:24:00,753
Battle stations.

677
01:24:02,025 --> 01:24:03,390
Mujahedeen.

678
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,694
1,000 meters.

679
01:24:09,499 --> 01:24:10,898
Crank it up.

680
01:24:16,139 --> 01:24:17,606
Traversing left.

681
01:24:17,874 --> 01:24:19,774
Come on, man. Come on.

682
01:24:21,811 --> 01:24:23,244
Give me power to the tank.

683
01:24:24,514 --> 01:24:25,208
Shit.

684
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:27,541
I can't, she won't start.

685
01:24:29,219 --> 01:24:31,016
Go to master battery.

686
01:24:32,789 --> 01:24:35,087
Shit! The battery's dead, sir.

687
01:24:56,112 --> 01:24:57,272
Get us outta here.

688
01:24:57,647 --> 01:24:58,978
I'm trying.

689
01:24:59,349 --> 01:25:00,907
It's overheated.

690
01:25:01,117 --> 01:25:03,017
Manual traverse left.

691
01:25:12,262 --> 01:25:13,456
Gunner.

692
01:25:13,663 --> 01:25:14,755
Frag.

693
01:25:16,466 --> 01:25:18,161
We're out of frags.

694
01:25:18,234 --> 01:25:19,531
Anything.

695
01:25:23,606 --> 01:25:25,096
I gotta heat up.

696
01:25:35,018 --> 01:25:36,576
Goddamnit. Come on!

697
01:26:03,313 --> 01:26:04,610
On the way.

698
01:26:08,284 --> 01:26:10,013
Spread out!

699
01:26:10,954 --> 01:26:11,750
Up.

700
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,455
On the way.

701
01:26:18,595 --> 01:26:20,392
They're in RPG range, sir.

702
01:26:30,173 --> 01:26:31,834
Come on!

703
01:26:35,145 --> 01:26:36,203
I got it.

704
01:27:06,009 --> 01:27:07,101
Khan.

705
01:27:08,111 --> 01:27:10,443
Tank. Kaput. Now.

706
01:27:11,448 --> 01:27:12,506
Now!

707
01:27:13,349 --> 01:27:15,510
Moustafa! Come on!

708
01:27:16,586 --> 01:27:18,281
I have what I want.

709
01:27:19,022 --> 01:27:20,080
The Beast escapes!

710
01:27:20,723 --> 01:27:23,021
Allah has tossed a peach in our laps --
Enjoy it.

711
01:27:23,393 --> 01:27:24,883
Cousin, you are a pig!

712
01:27:35,438 --> 01:27:37,429
Hasan, you are clever.

713
01:27:37,807 --> 01:27:40,002
Can you learn a helicopter?

714
01:29:09,232 --> 01:29:10,494
This way.

715
01:29:35,325 --> 01:29:36,417
Shit.

716
01:30:09,125 --> 01:30:11,855
They can't get us. We're too high.

717
01:30:11,995 --> 01:30:13,690
Come on, you son of a bitch.

718
01:30:21,671 --> 01:30:23,639
Can't get elevation, he knows it.

719
01:30:24,240 --> 01:30:24,934
Who?

720
01:30:25,041 --> 01:30:26,975
-You're mine.
-Badal.

721
01:30:27,644 --> 01:30:30,135
-Keep 'em coming.
-Last round, sir.

722
01:30:40,223 --> 01:30:41,019
Reload.

723
01:30:41,557 --> 01:30:42,649
We're out.

724
01:30:53,069 --> 01:30:54,434
She's burning up.

725
01:30:54,837 --> 01:30:56,566
Make it to the pass.

726
01:31:43,586 --> 01:31:44,314
Sir!

727
01:31:45,154 --> 01:31:46,348
Rocket.

728
01:31:46,989 --> 01:31:48,650
I need the rocket.

729
01:31:58,935 --> 01:32:00,425
Khan! Rocket.

730
01:32:01,037 --> 01:32:02,197
Throw.

731
01:32:02,839 --> 01:32:04,033
Throw!

732
01:32:52,822 --> 01:32:54,790
The pass is directly ahead.

733
01:32:54,857 --> 01:32:56,256
One hundred meters.

734
01:33:10,439 --> 01:33:11,906
Faster, Kaminski.

735
01:33:11,974 --> 01:33:13,236
Yes, sir.

736
01:33:51,647 --> 01:33:53,547
It only hit the muzzle.

737
01:33:55,251 --> 01:33:57,845
We made it, sir. We made it.

738
01:34:17,874 --> 01:34:21,833
Allah! Why have you forsaken us?

739
01:35:17,466 --> 01:35:21,163
Goliath was covered with armor,
but just a rock brought him down!

740
01:35:24,807 --> 01:35:25,967
Badal.

741
01:36:00,376 --> 01:36:02,105
We're off the tracks, sir.

742
01:36:02,545 --> 01:36:03,944
Oh, God.

743
01:36:25,234 --> 01:36:26,963
Make a run for it, sir?

744
01:36:27,203 --> 01:36:28,192
No.

745
01:36:28,838 --> 01:36:31,466
The gunships are coming,
we're safe in here.

746
01:36:39,482 --> 01:36:40,744
Close it!

747
01:36:46,022 --> 01:36:47,319
Tank Boy.

748
01:36:48,724 --> 01:36:50,749
I said, Tank Boy!

749
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:53,619
I've got something for you, Tank Boy.

750
01:36:53,696 --> 01:36:55,095
Koverchenko.

751
01:36:58,367 --> 01:37:00,301
Kinda hot in there, Tank Boy?

752
01:37:00,803 --> 01:37:03,567
Sir, they got us.

753
01:37:03,639 --> 01:37:04,901
Shit.

754
01:37:05,174 --> 01:37:06,573
We gotta go up.

755
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:08,609
We're gonna die in here.

756
01:37:08,711 --> 01:37:10,338
Tank Boy.

757
01:37:13,115 --> 01:37:14,980
I want you, Tank Boy.

758
01:37:27,763 --> 01:37:29,958
You know our standing orders.

759
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:31,960
What?

760
01:37:33,002 --> 01:37:36,699
"Out of commission, become a pillbox.
Out of ammo, become a bunker.

761
01:37:36,806 --> 01:37:39,274
"Out of time, become heroes."

762
01:37:45,681 --> 01:37:47,740
You must be out of your fucking mind.

763
01:37:48,584 --> 01:37:50,211
Now. Together.

764
01:37:59,495 --> 01:38:00,894
Get the pin.

765
01:38:05,668 --> 01:38:07,568
We're gonna die in here.

766
01:38:07,803 --> 01:38:09,031
Golikov.

767
01:38:09,338 --> 01:38:10,862
You son of a bitch.

768
01:38:11,307 --> 01:38:12,274
Don't shoot.

769
01:38:14,143 --> 01:38:15,303
Don't shoot.

770
01:38:43,672 --> 01:38:45,469
Take the knife.

771
01:38:52,047 --> 01:38:53,878
Allah is too generous!

772
01:38:54,717 --> 01:38:56,776
Konstantin, I didn't want to leave you.

773
01:38:58,087 --> 01:38:59,782
Just take Daskal and let us go.

774
01:39:00,823 --> 01:39:02,723
Please don't let him kill me.

775
01:39:03,225 --> 01:39:04,419
Get up.

776
01:39:05,427 --> 01:39:07,554
Such unmanliness makes revenge unclean.

777
01:39:12,134 --> 01:39:13,795
Nanawatai.

778
01:39:18,541 --> 01:39:20,941
He will always be Russian.

779
01:39:21,377 --> 01:39:23,709
Move aside and I will kill them all!

780
01:39:29,652 --> 01:39:31,017
Tank kaput.

781
01:39:31,654 --> 01:39:33,019
Tank kaput.

782
01:39:34,023 --> 01:39:35,354
Nanawatai.

783
01:39:45,201 --> 01:39:47,726
Are you an angel or a devil?

784
01:40:15,364 --> 01:40:17,059
Take the boots.

785
01:40:17,433 --> 01:40:19,162
Take the helmet.

786
01:40:20,069 --> 01:40:21,730
Take the boots.

787
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:26,906
Sorry, sir.

788
01:40:27,977 --> 01:40:29,672
Not much of a war.

789
01:40:30,846 --> 01:40:32,336
No Stalingrad.

790
01:40:35,150 --> 01:40:37,948
How is it that we're the Nazis this time?

791
01:40:40,089 --> 01:40:41,488
How is that?

792
01:40:43,759 --> 01:40:45,954
I tried to be a good soldier.

793
01:40:47,630 --> 01:40:50,997
But you can't be a good soldier
in a rotten war, sir.

794
01:40:53,369 --> 01:40:55,860
I want you to live to see them win.

795
01:40:57,306 --> 01:40:58,330
Go.

796
01:40:59,742 --> 01:41:01,232
I said, "Go!"

797
01:42:36,472 --> 01:42:37,530
Afghanistan.

798
01:43:08,003 --> 01:43:09,903
I don't understand you.

799
01:43:18,614 --> 01:43:19,979
Konstantin.

800
01:43:34,129 --> 01:43:35,994
Forgive me, my Khan...

801
01:43:39,968 --> 01:43:41,595
Two escaped.
