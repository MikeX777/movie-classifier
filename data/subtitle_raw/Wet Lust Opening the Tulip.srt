I might fall in love with you.

131
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:27,153

135
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,552
Well. I can't say this or that
about other people's business...

136
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,885
I might have to use magnets
one day too.

137
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,661
Did you know?

138
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,267
Yes, I am no novice to
the pachinko business.

139
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,473
I hope you don't turn into
a dubious person like me.

140
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,016
Why didn't you tell them?

141
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:30,055
Because you don't want to hurt
our relationship?

142
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:36,021
Do you really think our relationship
means that much to me?

143
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,525
We are just two lowlives.

144
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:55,076
If you get busted, you will
be beaten almost to death.

145
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,846
I didn't tell anyone because
I understood your situation.

146
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,821
But he was desperate at that time.

147
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:08,857
What are you going to do to him?

148
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:14,359
My plan is just to be nice to him.

149
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,127

- Idiot!

153
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,394
At least, I enjoy doing it!

154
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,997
Your face makes me sick.

155
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:01,233
Please hide it.
Girls don't like that kind of face.

156
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,843
They would run away.

157
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,605
Idiot! It's not that I like
your face either!

158
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,681

You are crazy!

168
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,568
I can't believe you own
such valuable things!

169
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,443

These are the old man's!

170

171
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,511

172

00:14:48,488 --> 00:14:53,050
Unlike you, I stay at one girl's
place, and then at another's!

175
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,654
You are saying this because
you don't know girls!

176
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:01,792
You are 25 years old!
Such a good age to date girls!

177
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,892
ls there something wrong with you?

178
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,870
Are you done talking?

179
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:10,007
- Follow me!
- What are you going to do?

180
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,819
What is this?

181
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,054
Didn't you tell me that you'd
bring them in the summer?

182
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:31,494
I'll store them now in advance.

183
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:35,124
I will bring you a kotatsu
and a heater next year!

184
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,670
You store them at my place,
and you go out earning money?

185
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,501
Take good care of them!

186
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:44,475
I got it. You don't have
to say it again and again!

187
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:45,908
What are you talking about?

188
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:49,607
I have the right to refuse
customers I don't like!

189
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:55,210
There are a lot of girls waiting
for me to stay at their place!

190
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,153
Okay! I got it.

191
00:15:57,257 --> 00:16:01,956
- How about him?
- He is a virgin! Pathetic!

192
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:07,592
Idiot! You can't be a virgin at 25!

193
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,359
How come you know my age?

194
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:14,565
- Whatever! You pathetic idiot!
- Leave me alone!

195
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:20,670
Listen! You have to hit
on girls ﬁrst!

196
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:24,409
And think about consequences later!

197
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,816
Okay? Don't forget it!

198
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:36,859
<i>First block, second block, third block,
fourth block and ﬁfth block...</i>

199
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:40,627
Mean old man!

200
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,201
Why did he talk to me like that?

201
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:50,072
He's a faggot! He must
have fallen in love with you!

202
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,804
Leave me alone! You're mean!

203
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,813
Even the old man pitied you.

204
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,317
It would have been even
weirder if he had pitied me.

205
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:02,717
Hey! You have to follow me!

206
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:03,983
What for?

207
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,458
I appreciate the money
you gave me earlier.

208
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,925
Get in!

209
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:18,029
You just have to listen
to what I say!

210
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:22,074
-What?
- I am going to help you.

211
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,302
Idiot! What are you going to do?

212
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:27,675
- You want to have sex, don't you?
- Of course I want to!

213
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:33,275
But I am not like you!
Do you know how to talk to girls?

214
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,514
Actually, I don't. You just know
when you do it.

215
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,555
Leave me alone!

216
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:47,659
<i>First block, second block, third block,
fourth block and ﬁfth block to make a bridge...</i>

217
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,559
Hello. Thank you for having me.

218
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,364
Hello.

219
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,845
I am a tailor.

220
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,680
I make formal dresses.

221
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,016
You must have seen the suit
he is wearing.

222
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:13,927
I make all of them.

223
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,955
They are well-made, aren't day?

224
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,302
Hurry!

225
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,606
<i>Yes. ..</i>

226
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,348
Thank you for having me!

227
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,560
It hurts!

228
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,631
I am saying it hurts!

229
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:52,959
Sorry!

230
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,124
Thank you for having me!

231
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,065
Sorry!

232
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:01,701
Sorry...

233
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:15,143
Sorry... Sorry...

234
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,764
Calm down!

235
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,703
The only reason I do this
is because Hiroshi asked me to!

236
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,866
I know! Sorry...

237
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:52,718
I don't know what to do!
I don't know what to do! Please, tell me!

238
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:56,193
You don't know how to have
sex at all, do you?

239
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,428
Sorry! I give UP!

240
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:03,332
I can't put up with a guy
who behaves like a drugged dog!

241
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,665
I can't take it anymore!

242
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:09,208
What an uncouth guy!

243
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,770
I got it.

244
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,108
It's over.

245
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,545
But do me a favor!

246
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,715
What?

247
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:24,381
Could you tell him that I did
have sex with you?

248
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,057
Please!

249
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,032
ﬁne!

250
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,161
Thank you very much!

251
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:50,048
What did you do? How pathetic!

252
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:53,949
Idiot! Fool! Trash!

253
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,418
I know!

254
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,170
We‘ve been waiting for you!
Please, come in

255
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:25,076
I am Michiko, a female professional
pachinko player.

256
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,016
I am Hiroshi's friend.

257
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,751
I am sorry for telling you what
I want over the phone earlier.

258
00:21:31,858 --> 00:21:34,725
Are you ready to provide
what I asked for?

259
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,989
Yes, they are ready.

260
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:39,728
Please start.

261
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,496
Okay, let's start the process.

262
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:47,663
Are you okay with starting
the game immediately?

263
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,366
I accept the offer.

264
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,271
3-ball game...

265
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,874
Are you okay with it?
Please check.

266
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:02,650
They look okay.

267
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,150
Please start.

268
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,817
Game start!

269
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,864
Jackpot!

270
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,006
I lost!

271
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,407
I've heard a lot about you
from him.

272
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:03,176
Apparently, you can't focus on your work
because you want to have sex.

273
00:23:03,316 --> 00:23:08,345
Once you become a good gamer,
girls will follow you by themselves!

274
00:23:16,162 --> 00:23:19,621
More girls! More skills!

275
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:45,852
- I pity him.
- But he must have good skills.

276
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:48,689
He will become big!
He is not like you!

277
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,786
How dare you say such things!

278
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,536
- Maybe this is not enough.
- Harder!

279
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:08,407
- Don't you feel it?
- Fuck me harder!

280
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,251
That's right.
Maybe that's the spot!

281
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,913
-This?
-That's not it!

282
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:18,990
Idiot!

283
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,287
-That's it!
-This?

284
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:23,020
Yes! Yes!

285
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,723
-No!
- Which is it?

286
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,162
Idiot!

287
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,927
You got it wrong!

288
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,998
That's it! Maybe that...

289
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,141
That's not it... That's not it...

290
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,976
That's it! That's...

291
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,552
That's not it! That's not it!

292
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:52,124
I failed.

293
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,249
You were very close though!

294
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,094
What?

295
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:14,068
What?

296
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,378
I used to be the girl boss
of a gang in my hometown...

297
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,044
but I want to become a proper
woman from now on.

298
00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:00,619
- Thank you for visiting our business.
- You look very excited.

299
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,287
The staff at Heiwa is excited about
improving our business...

300
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:09,459
with the help of the best expert
in Japan.

301
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:20,007
Please follow me.

302
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:37,622
Mister! Nice to have you here today!

303
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,994
With your help, I've earned a lot.

304
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:44,433
- Really?
- You may go now.

305
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,164
- I will call you if I need you.
-Yes.

306
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:54,270
Hey, we can't relax here.
Why don't you go to the 2nd ﬂoor?

307
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,616
Let's go then.

308
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,795
Please go downstairs.

309
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:19,337
<i>I see...</i>

310
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,771
I followed you because you
told me so earlier.

311
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,776
And it's noisy downstairs.

312
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:29,576
Also, please don't use that
formal tone.

313
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:05,379
Hey! Spank me!

314
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:07,748
Slap me! Slap me!

315
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:11,414
Spank me! Slap me!

316
00:28:11,557 --> 00:28:15,050
Spank me! Spank me!

317
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:19,121
How's that?

318
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:25,437
Slap me! Harder!

319
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:32,901
Spank me!

320
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,679
Spank me!

321
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:43,415
No! Hit me harder!

322
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,256
Slap me!

323
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:59,471
- Like that?
-Spank me!

324
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:10,942
No! That's not it! That's it!

325
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,951
That's it! Harder!

326
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:17,920
Harder! That's it!

327
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,822
That's it! Harder!

328
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:23,424
Like that?

329
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:28,395
Spank me!

330
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,492
That's it! Harder!

331
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:36,165
That's it! Harder!
That's it! Spank me!

332
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:43,042
Harder!
Spank me! Spank me!

333
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,384
Spank me!

334
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,477
Harder!

335
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:58,461
That's it! That's it!

336
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,532
Spank me!

337
00:30:05,337 --> 00:30:06,736
Cigarette!

338
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,469
Lighter!

339
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:21,509
Although you can easily open the girls' legs,
you can't make the pachinko tulips bloom.

340
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:23,552
I am sorry.

341
00:30:24,456 --> 00:30:28,188
My own teacher rejected his pupils
immediately if he thought...

342
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:32,696
they'd never be able to make
the tulips bloom.

343
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:45,866
sir!

344
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:49,740
Long time no see...

345
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,848
That's what I want to say.

346
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:57,252
Do you know how hard
I tried to find you?

347
00:30:57,389 --> 00:31:00,256
What have you been doing
all these years?

348
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:05,428
Since you kicked me out
to make me independent...

349
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:10,832
I have been trying hard
to improve my skills.

350
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:14,573
Anyway, We can't talk here.

351
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:18,038
Let's go somewhere more comfortable.

352
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:20,942
Please, after you.

353
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,738
<i>No.</i>

354
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:26,217
I can't go now.

355
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,291
Please.

356
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,866
sir!

357
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:47,400
sir!

358
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:03,580
<i>Ramen</i>

359
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:11,152
My teacher used to tell me that
the left hand that inserts the balls...

360
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:16,599
and the right hand that snaps,
should work in sync at all times.

361
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:23,334
The harmony between the left hand and the
right hand brings us more balls in the end.

362
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:31,711
I think he couldn't accept people who
play pachinko without using their left hand.

363
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:36,819
As he got older, he must have felt that there
was not much time remaining for him.

364
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,249
He must have despaired when he found that
he couldn't use the old method anymore.

365
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,454
It's a depressing story.

366
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,125
It sure is.

367
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:49,934
Men's life is just too short.

368
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:53,027
Sex is not so different.

369
00:32:54,606 --> 00:33:00,568
The amount a man can release
during his entire life is limited.

370
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,479
After releasing the full amount,
red balls come out in the end.

371
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:12,151
That's the end of it.

372
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:21,163
Moreover, "The End" is written
on the red balls.

373
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:28,066
That's the very last ball he can
use for his last game.

374
00:33:30,976 --> 00:33:33,570
Follow me.

375
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,472
Yes.

376
00:33:39,218 --> 00:33:40,947
Wait a sec.

377
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:44,387
Are you coming home tonight?

378
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:01,805
Isn't this where your girlfriend works?

379
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:05,537
She works here! What am I supposed
to do when I see her face?

380
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:09,341
<i>Horny Gentlemen's Magic Hall</i>

381
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:14,214
I know it is difﬁcult for you,
but I have my reasons.

382
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:18,153
In that case,
please tell me the reason.

383
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,089
I will tell you after the show.

384
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:23,662
Would you follow my instructions?

385
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:24,626
Yes.

386
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,062
So no more complaints. Got it?

387
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,600
Say it!

388
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,894

390
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,265

- Does she know that we are here?
- Of course.

401

No way!

406
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:12,500

00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,874
- Did you?
- I did.

408
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:26,273
Did you?

409
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:28,477
I did.

410
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,239
Did you?

411
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,501
Now you saw it.

00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:51,736

413
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,444
What did you just say?

414
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,207
Sleep with her.

415
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,307
Why?

416
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,385
I already have my red balls.
I can't do it.

417
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,935
Thank you for having me.

418
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:29,204
Nice to see you.

420
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,459
I am going to start.

421
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:04,173
Too much pachinko play made me
incapable of having sex with girls.

422
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,319
The open tulips might have
sucked my energy.

423
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:35,240
Good!

424
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:38,842

I really want to become
a proper woman.

437
00:39:57,629 --> 00:40:00,724
And think about consequences later!

438
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:04,700

To make girls like me by all means!

439

I didn't know what to do
when I woke up.

451
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:04,351

I wanted to talk with you too.
Do you want something?

Give him some money, okay?

463
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,827
Get it from your father.

You are the least attractive one

In other words, you are nothing
but a "rice-cooking girl" to him!

- Yes, that's what you are!

That's enough. Don't you think?

513
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:39,788
That means I am just
a rice-cooking girl, right?

514
00:46:39,931 --> 00:46:42,400
No! You are not!

515
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:46,834

I would die.

I am going to die!
I am going to die!

529
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,053
- I am going to die!
- Idiot! Wait!

530
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,623
Just let her die!

531
00:47:39,724 --> 00:47:43,058
If you have time for this stupidity,
why don't you go...

532
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,492
to the pachinko parlor and
practice some more?

533
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:49,032
Let's go to the pachinko parlor!

534
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,932
Do you really want to be killed
by me?

535
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:55,097
- I am going to die!
- Idiot! Wait!

536
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,799
- I am going to die!
- I am going to die with you!

537
00:47:57,909 --> 00:48:02,142
Honey! Idiot! Fool!

538
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,045
Honey! Help me!

539
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:09,313
Honey! Help me! Honey!

540
00:48:17,295 --> 00:48:20,526
Makiko... I know you will come.

541
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,896
I know you will deﬁnitely come.

542
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,102
Makiko! I am waiting for you...

543
00:48:35,313 --> 00:48:37,077
Honey...

544
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:45,181
<i>If love is this painful,
l don't want to love anyone.</i>

545
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:10,974
<i>I can't forget...</i>

546
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,454
Honey! You are a good guy...

547
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:31,692
Honey...

548
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:35,068
Now I know you love me!

549
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,436
It's so hard!

550
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:40,977
Yes, I love you.

551
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,610
It's so hard!

552
00:49:56,661 --> 00:50:00,894
You really love me!

553
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,331
You followed me into the water
because you love me!

554
00:50:08,106 --> 00:50:09,870
That's right.

555
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:17,711
But having sex in a situation like this
is nothing but a hellish experience!

556
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:19,340
I am okay.

557
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:24,483
I am in a paradise!
I am in a paradise!

558
00:50:27,992 --> 00:50:30,188
She hasn't come, despite the fact that
I've been waiting for her this long!

559
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:33,855
No matter what I do,
I am just not popular with girls!

560
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:37,097
This is hell!

561
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:41,434
A living hell!

562
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:43,970
Shit!

563
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:48,570
This is hell!

564
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:51,774
Girls! Girls! Girls!

565
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,811
Akira!

566
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:30,520
- Akira!
-What’s up, mom?

567
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:34,023
People are looking at us!
Stop it!

568
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:39,953
- Akira! He is dead...
-No way!

569
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:44,001
He looked very healthy the other day.
A car accident?

570
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:47,196
-No! That's not it...
-Suicide?

571
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:49,907
That's not in.

572
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:58,007
I am talking about your real father.

573
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:04,950
There is nothing I can do
about him though...

574
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,119
Such an idiot!

575
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:15,659
Idiot! What's up?

576
00:52:16,667 --> 00:52:19,398
What?! What's up?

577
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:23,939
My father passed away!

578
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:29,741
This shop...
He was the owner of this shop!

579
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:39,918
This is very overwhelming!
Please come with me.

580
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,053
Come in please.

581
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:02,378
Please go ahead.

582
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,861
Please go ahead.

583
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:26,567
What is this? I have no tears at all.
Say something.

584
00:53:34,412 --> 00:53:35,880
Please.

585
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:50,019
- He is the lawyer.
-Yes.

586
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:54,458
Please read this.

587
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:58,197
- What is this?
-This is his will.

588
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:03,701
- Am I supposed to read it all?
- Yes.

589
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,947
Please explain it to me.
What am I supposed to do?

590
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:20,218
To make it short, he bequeathed
everything he had to you.

591
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:23,453
But this will be valid only
if you get married.

592
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:24,722
- Marry?
- Yes.

593
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:30,632
He lived alone since he separated
from your mother.

594
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:36,333
He had been very lonely,
and he knew about you.

595
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:39,967
He felt bad about you being a virgin.

596
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:44,844
- A virgin?
- He didn't want you to live like that.

597
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:51,116
So he wanted you to use
the money to get married.

598
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:56,591
You have to get married by the deadline
if you are still single.

599
00:54:56,727 --> 00:55:02,427
In other words, the deadline is Tuesday,
November 11 at 9 AM.

600
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:10,566
If you get married by this date,
you will inherit 88,700,000 yen in total.

601
00:55:12,343 --> 00:55:14,573
- I see.
- Here it is.

602
00:55:14,712 --> 00:55:16,305
Thank you.

603
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:19,544
88,700,000. ..

604
00:55:20,217 --> 00:55:24,586
- What date is it today?
- It's November 10.

605
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:28,249
- It's tomorrow!
- By 9 AM?

606
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:31,659
9 AM, the time when the city
ofﬁce opens.

607
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,762
It's 88,700,000 yen!

608
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:43,904
I wish he had told me that he was
my father when he was alive.

609
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:47,011
Why didn't he tell me?

610
00:55:47,144 --> 00:55:51,103
But he left you 88,700,000 yen
anyway.

611
00:55:51,248 --> 00:55:53,478
What are you going to do?

612
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:55,881
You have to get married.

613
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:59,047
Can you do it by tomorrow morning?

614
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,387
I can make it!

615
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:07,594
There must be at least one girl
I can marry!

616
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:10,359
Well... You have 88,700,000 anyway.

617
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:13,960
There must be a girl or two
who would marry you.

618
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:17,939
All girls are the same.

619
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:20,670
I don't need relationships!
I can live alone!

620
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:26,578
I want you to marry him.

621
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:29,517
Hello? Isn't it a sweet deal?

622
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:31,748
It's Akira. Akira.

623
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,224
If he marries a girl, he gets the money.

624
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:38,489
88,700,000.

625
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:42,624
A total of 88,700,000.

626
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:47,131
I see. Please consider it.

627
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:49,036
Thank you.

628
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:06,553
Sorry.

629
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:13,822
It turns out I had a father after all,
but he passed away.

630
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:16,663
Come here.

631
00:57:20,503 --> 00:57:23,529
I've heard you are going
to inherit a fortune.

632
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:27,740
I am happy for you.
I am really happy.

633
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:31,542
But I don't know if I can
get the money.

634
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:37,546
This might sound stupid, but I have to
get married in order to inherit the money.

635
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:40,654
- Come here.
- Yes.

636
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:48,799
What's the problem?
Just do it.

637
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:51,459
Do you know a good woman?

638
00:57:53,671 --> 00:57:56,299
Yes, I do.

639
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,138
Please introduce her to me.

640
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:02,143
I have to get married
by 9 AM tomorrow.

641
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:08,914
Well... I can marry you.

642
00:58:09,053 --> 00:58:11,886
But marrying you is not an option.

643
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,457
Please forgive me.

644
00:58:13,557 --> 00:58:16,788
That's not the right thing to do.
Sorry, please forgive me.

645
00:58:16,894 --> 00:58:19,556
-What's the big deal?
- It's not right. It's not right.

646
00:58:19,697 --> 00:58:22,189
- Please forgive me.
- Why!

647
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:26,736
- It's not right! Please forgive me.
-Why!

648
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:30,296
It's not right! Sorry. Sorry.

649
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:33,570
Please forgive me. Sorry.
Please forgive me.

650
00:58:33,711 --> 00:58:35,475
It's not right.

651
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:43,580
Hello! Hello?

652
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,712
<i>First block, second block,
third block...</i>

653
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:47,316
<i>First block, second
block. third block... Well...</i>

654
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:47,517
Well...

655
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:51,492
Maybe it's time for me to clear
all of the girls on my list.

656
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:53,154
I have to give all of them to Akira.

657
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:54,255
<i>When I view the orher side of the bridge, 17- or
18-year-old girls...</i> I <i>have to give all of them to Akira.</i>

658
00:58:54,264 --> 00:59:02,264
<i>When I view the orherside of the bridge,
17- or 18-year-old girls...</i>

659
00:59:07,645 --> 00:59:15,645
<i>When you measure the weights of loyalty
and humanity, loyalty is heavier in men's world.</i>

660
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,492
<i>When you measure the weights of loyalry and
humanity, loyalry is heavier in men's world.</i> Go away!

661
00:59:30,501 --> 00:59:31,593
Go away!

662
00:59:33,184 --> 00:59:36,484
Go away!

663
00:59:39,443 --> 00:59:43,880
Akira! I've heard the news
from my friend.

664
00:59:44,014 --> 00:59:45,243
Idiot! Stop it!

665
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:48,977
What are you doing? Leave me alone!
Marry me!

666
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:51,487
- Stop saying stupid shit!
- What's the matter?

667
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,956
I can serve you right. Akira...

668
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:58,120
I will never give Sayuri to you!

669
00:59:59,697 --> 01:00:02,166
Answer me! Answer me right now!

670
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,632
You have to hurry!

671
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:08,566
Go away now!

672
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:11,505
Why does it have to go like this?

673
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:13,576
Sorry! I am really sorry!

674
01:00:13,711 --> 01:00:20,879
No matter how hard you try,
I can't marry you.

675
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:23,112
I am really sorry!

676
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:28,191
I am going to give him everything!

677
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:32,023
Girls are not much different from
pieces of underwear to me anyway!

678
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:35,058
I can't take it anymore!

679
01:00:37,601 --> 01:00:39,262
Akira!

680
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,997
I can't take it anymore!

681
01:00:42,906 --> 01:00:45,204
Wait! Akira!

682
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,508
What?

683
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:51,945
Would you marry me?
I can become a good wife for you!

684
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:54,211
But you are his girlfriend!

685
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:56,878
I don’t care about that pathetic guy!

686
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,853
Okay! Okay!

687
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,949
Just let me consider it!
Just let me consider it!

688
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:11,927
They all say they'll consider the offer,
but they don’t respect it in the end.

689
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:17,465
Who do they really think I am?

690
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:20,472
How miserable.

691
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:27,815
Sorry.

692
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:34,388
<i>It's an airy, white body...</i>

693
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:37,927
It's about time to do it right
and with guts.

694
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:42,191
God is not always generous.

695
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:46,365
- How about me?
- I can't marry you!

696
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:49,268
I know you are frigid!

697
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,944
Okay! It's ﬁnished!

698
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,979
Makiko...

699
01:01:58,115 --> 01:02:04,248
<i>First block, second block, third block,

It's not a bad deal.

I don't want to!

788
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:51,565
I have no one else to turn to.

789
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:19,889
Why did you make me play
a losing game?

790

I didn't, it's your skill.

829
01:13:10,153 --> 01:13:13,748
