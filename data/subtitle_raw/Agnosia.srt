1
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,589
PYRENEES, 1892

2
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,590
This way, gentlemen.

3
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,114
Gentlemen,

4
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,276
l won't keep you waiting any longer.

5
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,550
As you know, Holbein lndustries

6
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,556
have manufactured

7
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,637
the best weapons for many years now.

8
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,637
But to truly revolutionize

9
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,829
our industry...

10
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,951
Gentlemen, l give you...

11
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,798
Artur Prats.

12
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,312
l'm a man of few words.

13
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,432
So l'll keep this short.

14
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,680
Above all,
l'd like you to see for yourselves

15
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,916
what we've got here
to show you today.

16
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,319
Please, come and look

17
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,033
through the telescopes.

18
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,075
Tell me,

19
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,838
how many balloons can you see?

20
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,916
l see two.

21
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,236
These are the best telescopes
on the market.

22
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,839
We already know these models.

23
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,790
l know.

24
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,429
Are you all right?

25
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,119
Are you hurt?

26
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,480
l'm sorry, Daddy.
Forgive me.

27
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,908
l'm not your dad.

28
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,397
Joana, l'm here now.

29
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,959
Don't worry, sweetheart.

30
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,110
Oh, God.

31
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,868
Are you okay?

32
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,918
Daddy?

33
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,552
Look at me,
look at me, darling!

34
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,189
Joana, look at me.

35
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,193
Extra, extra!
Another anarchist bomb attack!

36
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,312
Seven murdered and fifteen injured
in Almirall street!

37
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,479
Stay still!

38
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,878
No, not his face!

39
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,356
Just calm down.
What happened?

40
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,719
l was fired.

41
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,636
Why?

42
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,478
lt's complicated.

43
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,159
Then start at the beginning.

44
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,229
1 1 DAYS EARLlER

45
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,910
The day begins
at half past five in the morning.

46
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,075
At five on Tuesdays,

47
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,635
and at four o'clock
if you have to go to market.

48
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,239
You'll have to make sure

49
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,069
all the doors and windows
are shut tight before night falls.

50
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,230
From that moment on, no one
is allowed on Madam's floor.

51
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,999
Any problem with that?

52
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,189
None at all.

53
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,517
Close up everything before dark
and ask before going upstairs.

54
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,835
Piece of cake.

55
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,269
Hold on.

56
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,113
Let me do it.

57
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,153
This is where Ma'am sits.

58
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,955
What's that for?

59
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,269
To tell them apart.
lt seems she can distinguish colours.

60
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,313
That's why we all wear rosettes.
You see?

61
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,675
Marga, that's not exactly true.

62
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,589
We get branded here like cattle
because of that freak of nature.

63
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,153
Mariano, cut that out!

64
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,638
Take that back this instant.

65
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,475
Mariano...

66
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,275
lt's Mr. Lardin.

67
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,038
He was meant to be back tomorrow.

68
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,719
He's decided to come back early.

69
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,148
Get to your positions.

70
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,396
Set another place, Margarita.
Carles is hungry!

71
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,395
Thank you.

72
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,714
Who is this Carles?

73
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,878
Carles Lardin, Madam's fiance.

74
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,514
l'm going back to Madrid
before the end of the month.

75
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,392
lf you agree,
we can close the deal.

76
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,431
-Fine.
-lt's the answerto our prayers.

77
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,438
That's great. But let's
leave business until tomorrow.

78
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,395
Your return couldn't be more timely.

79
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,788
How come?

80
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,351
l'd ratherthe Doctortold us.

81
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,872
Meissner has returned?

82
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,318
Not exactly.

83
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,829
What? ls he still here?

84
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,429
l won't be for much longer,
l assure you.

85
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,516
Excuse me, Doctor,
l didn't mean to...

86
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,994
Don't worry, Carles.

87
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,358
What he means is that...

88
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,554
Well, you explain it.

89
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,670
My pleasure.

90
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,630
l'm very pleased
to be here this evening

91
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,072
to announce that, after having
studied Joana's case exhaustively,

92
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,314
l can finally give you a diagnosis.

93
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,476
Really?
Are you completely sure?

94
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,829
Please.

95
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,273
The hypnosis sessions with Joana
couldn't have been more revealing.

96
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,869
Hypnosis?

97
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,554
Allow me to explain.

98
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,038
We knew Joana had problems
recognising sounds,

99
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,516
objects and also people,
but we didn't understand why.

100
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,039
Well, now l am quite sure.

101
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,398
lmagine that this jug contains

102
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,672
all the stimuli reality offers us.

103
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,269
lmages, sounds, smells, etc.

104
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,755
Now when you look at this glass,

105
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,119
think of it as a brain,

106
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,709
young, healthy and pure.

107
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,278
From the day we're born

108
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,432
to the day we die,

109
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,192
this is all we actually perceive
of reality.

110
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,469
Thanks to this filter,

111
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,750
we can separate out
that extra information

112
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,714
which would otherwise
submerge our minds in chaos.

113
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,438
Unfortunately,
this is not the case for Joana.

114
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,793
The encephalitis
she had as a child

115
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,116
destroyed that filter.

116
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,996
Since then, an excess of information
has been reaching Joana's brain.

117
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,758
Her brain can't process it

118
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,029
or remember...

119
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,236
l am sorry.

120
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,634
Don't worry.

121
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,798
What are you driving at
with all of this?

122
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,436
The sound proofing
of her bedroom is almost ready,

123
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,554
but l fear it isn't enough.

124
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,519
We need to seal
the room completely.

125
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,715
No inside or outside light.

126
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,950
What?
You want to put her in a cage?

127
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,394
No. ''Cocoon''

128
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,792
would be a more fitting description.

129
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,880
We'll finish this conversation later.

130
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,230
Joana.

131
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,670
l don't feel very comfortable
in this dress.

132
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,029
But you look beautiful.

133
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,117
lt's one of her mother's dresses.

134
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,470
Look.

135
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,153
Look who's here.

136
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,953
Come on, Joana.
Who is it?

137
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,274
lt's Carles.

138
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,754
Carles...

139
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,831
-Come on, say something to her.
-Daddy.

140
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,473
Doesn't she look pretty?

141
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,035
Radiant.

142
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,232
You'll see what a knock-out
she looks in a wedding dress.

143
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,671
lt's impossible to get near her.

144
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,752
That doctor is always there.

145
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,550
You won't find anything
in that house.

146
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,713
Are you sure?

147
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,270
Fine. ln that case...

148
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,270
Let's go.

149
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,274
Right.
We'll be in touch with you

150
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,596
just as soon as we have
a signed statement.

151
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,597
That wretch will nevertalk.

152
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,752
He doesn't know who's paying him.

153
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,349
Sir?

154
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,479
What do you mean by that?

155
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,717
lt's not the first time somebody's
been snooping about yourfactory,

156
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,753
but this time they tried to force
the lock on your office door.

157
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,758
Let's not kid ourselves, this has
nothing to do with anarchists.

158
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,279
l agree with you there.

159
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,755
lf you had any idea
who was behind this,

160
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,757
you'd let me know, wouldn't you?

161
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,632
Now, if you'll excuse me...

162
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,150
ls there anything l should know?

163
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,912
lndustrial espionage?

164
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,272
l'm only asking
if apart from manufacturing weapons,

165
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,869
you've also started
your own line in lenses?

166
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,235
You know l've always been
a very open-minded business woman.

167
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,035
l thought your determination
would have waned after so many years.

168
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,397
Your military friends are very keen

169
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,795
for you to make them
a telescopic rifle,

170
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,950
but one thing is selling something
you still haven't manufactured

171
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,872
and quite another

172
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,514
is speculating
with ''borrowed'' technology.

173
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,757
l hope you haven't come here
just to insult me.

174
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,355
Just accept it!

175
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,869
l never manufactured
the catadioptric lens.

176
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,992
You can look under
every last stone on earth,

177
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,792
but you won't find a thing.

178
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,277
l burnt it all.

179
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,679
So, as far as Joana Lenses
is concerned,

180
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,189
you can say goodbye
to yourtelescopic rifle.

181
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,039
That's a pity.

182
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,554
We were hoping to invest
in Joana Lenses.

183
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,630
l appreciate your generosity,

184
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,752
but we don't need your money.

185
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,996
Doesn't your pet
have anything to say?

186
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,554
-Goodbye, Lucille.
-l'm not finished.

187
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,116
We've known
each otherfor years,

188
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,551
l was hoping you'd invite me to
your beautiful daughter's big day.

189
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,515
By the way,

190
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,272
how is she?

191
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,916
My God, Lucille.
Don't you have any limits?

192
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,115
All right.
Now l'm going to ask you a question.

193
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,750
And l want you to tell me the truth.

194
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,116
During yourwork at the mansion
as a servant,

195
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,552
did you ever come into direct
contact with Artur Prats' daughter?

196
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,990
Carles?

197
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,269
ls that you?

198
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,109
No, Ma'am.

199
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,395
lt's me,

200
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,995
Vicent.
One of the servants. See?

201
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,835
Oh, hello.

202
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,593
l was on my way to my room
but l strayed off the path

203
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,712
and now l need somebody
to get me back to my route.

204
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,679
l see. Where do you need to...?

205
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,195
lf you can just wait a minute.

206
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,311
Whenever you're ready, Ma'am.

207
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,911
Can l ask you a question?

208
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,159
Go ahead.

209
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,675
Why did you stray from your route?

210
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,512
So l could see the stars.

211
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,152
They've started
covering up my bedroom windows,

212
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,192
and from time to time
l need to look outside this ''castle''.

213
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,233
The night sky is one of the few things
l can see just like everybody else.

214
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,076
Come here, take a look.

215
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,998
l'm sure if l pointed out
all l can see up there,

216
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,872
you'd be more lost than me.

217
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,673
For sure.

218
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,799
Truth be told,
l'm also a bit lost down here.

219
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,792
That sounded sad.

220
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,789
l never know for sure when somebody
is cheerful or angry or sad.

221
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,073
But l do have one trick.

222
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,354
Their breathing.

223
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,555
Breathing?

224
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,269
The way people breathe never lies.

225
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,358
Can you help me get back?

226
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,437
-Where to?
-To the handrail.

227
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,069
Of course.

228
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,631
Mind the step, Ma'am.

229
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,914
Thank you, Vicent.

230
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,394
Good night.

231
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,238
Good night, Ma'am.

232
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,958
And don't be sad.

233
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,912
One... two...

234
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,149
and three.

235
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,793
Still dressed?

236
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,560
Yes, l know,
l was miles away. Sorry.

237
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,476
-l'll walk you there.
-No.

238
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,910
l can make it to the bath on my own.
Watch.

239
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,797
l'm sorry, Ma'am.
The Doctor didn't...

240
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,116
But it's right here by my side.

241
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,189
Really?

242
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,112
Yes. Watch.

243
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,790
See?

244
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,629
Careful.

245
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,239
-Mariano, in the cornerwith it.
-Quickly.

246
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,311
-Vicent!
-Coming.

247
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,552
Can you help me with this?

248
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,751
ls the watertoo cold, Ma'am?

249
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,598
No, it's hot.

250
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,793
Could you bring me
some lukewarm water?

251
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,997
l'd have to go downstairs forthat,

252
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,078
and you know l can't leave you
in the bath on your own.

253
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,750
What's going to happen?
l'm not going anywhere.

254
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,189
Daddy!

255
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,110
Vincent!

256
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,754
Joana!

257
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,116
lt's all right,
it's me, your dad.

258
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,272
Call Doctor Meissner!

259
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,829
Now!

260
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,393
Stand up.

261
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,879
What do you want?

262
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,553
What do you want from me?

263
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,275
Carles.

264
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,709
Good luck.

265
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,273
Good night, gentlemen.

266
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,915
Have you got a moment?
Can we talk?

267
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,109
We do need to talk.
Have a seat.

268
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,313
Be honest.

269
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,191
Do you still think that Dr Meissner
won't be able to cure Joana?

270
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,276
l don't want to appear impertinent,

271
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,479
but l need to talk to you
about our current situation,

272
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,079
the company's situation.

273
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,717
Since l came back,
we haven't even...

274
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,434
We don't need a group of investors.

275
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,712
There's something
l can't get out my head.

276
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,348
You told Lucille Prevert

277
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,110
that you'd destroyed
the formula of the lens.

278
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,234
Was that true?

279
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,477
l mean, if we could still

280
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,232
make that lens,
we'd soon get through bad patch

281
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,431
without having to resort
to investors.

282
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,868
Orto Holbein, naturally.

283
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,359
Anything but Holbein,
you know that.

284
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,748
But we can choose our customers.
Just like we always have done.

285
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,517
Really?

286
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,033
Tell me how.

287
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,070
By tossing a coin
to decide if they're any good?

288
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,438
You don't realise.

289
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,318
What's the matter?

290
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,039
What are you afraid of?

291
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,037
Stop worrying about the business,

292
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,629
concern yourself more
with your own affairs.

293
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,832
What are you trying to say?

294
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,314
Your daughter is all l care about.

295
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,557
l'd do absolutely anything for her,

296
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,193
absolutely anything.

297
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,357
She will get better, Carles.

298
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,719
She will be cured.

299
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,550
And she'll be a marvellous mother

300
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,996
and a marvellous wife.

301
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,798
See?
There's nothing there.

302
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,159
How did you do that?

303
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,670
lt's magic.

304
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,468
Magic, he says. The only
magic things here are my balls.

305
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,158
That's real magic.
He took the flowerfrom the vase.

306
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,828
You're a fool,
you look like a fool.

307
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,837
All right, let's see
if you get this one.

308
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,515
Artur,

309
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,197
you're absolutely right,
the figures just don't add up.

310
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,436
We have to tighten our belts.

311
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,838
Eitherthat... or bankruptcy.

312
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,438
Vicent does him better.

313
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,633
Oh, yes, go on, do it for us.

314
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,311
Artur, if you like l could go

315
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,592
to Madrid at the end of the month
to close the deal.

316
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,870
lt would be the answer
to our prayers.

317
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,754
Carles...

318
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,029
Carles...

319
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,593
lt's so nice to feel dizzy, Carles.

320
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,916
l look at you
but l don't see you!

321
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,473
Why don't you give me a kiss?

322
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,035
Touch me, l can't see you!

323
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,069
Vicent!

324
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,388
Get out.

325
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,389
Let's go.

326
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,190
Let's go.

327
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,753
Get out of here!

328
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,516
lt should never have happened.

329
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,429
Not like that.

330
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,030
l read your report again last night

331
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,993
for a second time.

332
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,673
A quite extravagant option,
if you don't mind me saying so.

333
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,270
The hypnosis sessions
haven't produced anything.

334
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,314
Whateverthe secret
Prats entrusted to his daughter,

335
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,353
we're not going to find it
in her subconscious.

336
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,914
l'm afraid this is
the only alternative.

337
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,632
You've got three days
to carry out a new mission.

338
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,274
Nobody's going to hurt her, are they?

339
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,876
Half yourfee
is just in front of you.

340
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,155
''Darling daughter,

341
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,677
if you hearthese words,
it's because l'm no longer here.

342
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,191
Now, as l write these words,
it's hard to believe,

343
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,793
but l think that
after all these years together

344
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,472
l've come to the conclusion
that to really love somebody

345
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,238
you have to accept
that one day

346
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,908
we won't be here
to give the best of ourselves.

347
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,959
That is when we must
make way for someone else.

348
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,195
l've organised it

349
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,312
so you'll hear my last words
from the lips of Carles,

350
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,151
who was like a son to me.

351
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,109
He'll look after you and the factory
just as l always have.

352
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,792
l love you very much, my dear.

353
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,314
Very much indeed.

354
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,157
No fatherwants his children
to get sick.

355
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,110
But your illness
has made you special,

356
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,995
just as special
as your motherwas.

357
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,914
l've suffered a lot for you,
you know that,

358
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,919
but l want you to know,

359
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,795
l'd never have swapped
the daughter you've been

360
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,230
forthe daughter
you might have been.

361
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,030
You've caused me
more pain than anything,

362
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,834
but you've also given me
more happiness

363
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,032
than l everthought
l could aspire to in this life.

364
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,832
Your loving father.''

365
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,597
Leave me, please.

366
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,751
You must cure her.
Understand?

367
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,469
Now more than ever.
You have to do it.

368
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,633
l promised Mr. Prats l wouldn't rest
until l found a cure for his daughter.

369
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,831
And l will keep that promise.

370
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,315
The ''Cocoon'', remember?

371
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,393
We have to isolate her
from all stimuli.

372
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,589
Sounds, images,

373
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,836
tactile sensations, temperature,

374
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,191
absolutely everything,
for a period of three days.

375
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,755
That includes me, the servants

376
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,154
and even you.

377
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,710
Any interaction with other people

378
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,512
could ruin everything.

379
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,512
You mean lock her up
forthree days.

380
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,872
l know it's tough but we can
put a stop to these nervous fits.

381
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,119
To block out this confusing
universe she is immersed in,

382
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,880
she has to be totally isolated.

383
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,311
Begin the preparations immediately.

384
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,676
But whatever happens, we're getting
married on the 6th of January.

385
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,836
Without any possible delay.

386
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,359
Without delay.

387
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,759
Aren't you going to eat?

388
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,470
Yes.

389
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,275
Excuse me,
l was a little distracted.

390
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,032
l've tried on the tunic.

391
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,830
The doctor says l can't take it off.

392
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,589
l told him that in three days
l'll at least have to do number ones.

393
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,639
He just started laughing.

394
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,519
And so did l.

395
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,912
-Are you leaving now?
-Yes.

396
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,674
l have to go.

397
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,074
l'd love to stay here with you,
but it's late.

398
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,309
Carles, is it always
going to be like this?

399
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,516
Of course not.
Why do you say that?

400
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,873
lt's all right. You go.

401
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,000
The doctor is convinced
you will recover.

402
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,630
You'll see, when we are married.

403
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,037
You're so naughty!

404
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,430
Got any spare change, sir?

405
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,157
Do you want to take part
orto watch?

406
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,554
Take part orwatch?

407
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,035
Watch.

408
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,629
Don't turn around.

409
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,155
Don't turn around.

410
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,117
l'm not even going to open it.

411
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,148
Leave it inside
without making a noise.

412
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,593
-Are you feeling okay?
-Yes, sir.

413
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,831
Quick! Call Margarita.

414
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,556
Joana?

415
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,151
Joana?

416
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,589
Who's that?

417
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,519
Doctor? ls that you?

418
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,553
No, Joana, it's me.
Carles.

419
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,715
What?

420
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,633
Put the light on.

421
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,550
You see?

422
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:03,556
Carles,

423
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,317
is something wrong?

424
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,913
No, nothing.

425
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,998
Don't fret.
l just had to see you.

426
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,315
Right now? Are you crazy?

427
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,998
Let me explain.
Please...

428
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,759
l had to talk to you
before the wedding

429
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,032
and l thought that here
without anybody about...

430
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,633
l've been doing some thinking...

431
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,871
About us... and the factory.

432
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,753
What are you trying to do?
Ruin the treatment?

433
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,154
l know you don't believe
in Doctor Meissner,

434
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,796
but don't spoil everything, please,
even if it's just for daddy.

435
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,669
Please, leave.

436
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,913
l asked you to leave.

437
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,152
Why did you leave the room?

438
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,833
What went wrong?

439
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,559
l don't know.

440
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,357
l don't know, l thought maybe
she had cottoned on.

441
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:31,313
What are you talking about?
Do you think she recognised you?

442
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,317
No, it's not that.

443
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:39,359
lt's as if she could sense
l wasn't telling the truth.

444
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,230
-Are you getting cold feet?
-No.

445
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,308
Then go back inside
and follow our instructions.

446
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,232
ls everything in order, Doctor?

447
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,271
Yes.

448
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,752
The boy is going back in.

449
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,630
Carles, if you don't leave,
l'm going to scream.

450
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,558
-Just for a minute.
-Carles, no.

451
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,239
-You're very sad.
-What do you expect?

452
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,799
Joana...

453
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,833
ln all these years,
l've never had the courage

454
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,313
to tell you...

455
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,872
what l really feel for you.

456
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,312
Are you trying to say
you don't want to marry me?

457
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,873
Marry you?

458
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,753
There's nothing in this world
l'd rather do more.

459
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,918
So you've already got
what you wanted, haven't you?

460
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:49,916
Yes.

461
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,508
l have your hand,

462
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,917
because yourfather gave it to me.

463
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,474
But l'd like to have
asked you for it myself.

464
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,551
Aren't you going to say anything?

465
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,438
What am l meant to say?

466
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,949
Nothing.

467
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,435
l just wanted you to know.

468
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,034
l won't bother you any more.

469
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,949
Where are you going?

470
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,912
l have to go to the factory.

471
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,156
We've got so much work
still to do.

472
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,113
Besides, l don't want
to interfere with the treatment.

473
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,837
-One more thing.
-Yes?

474
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,714
l need...

475
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,797
l need yourfinger measurements.

476
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,280
lf we wait any longer
to orderthe rings,

477
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,959
they won't be ready in time.

478
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,350
Would you mind
if l came back tomorrow?

479
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,908
No. Of course not.
Tomorrow.

480
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:05,638
l'll be here.

481
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,515
Go and find the accounts ledgers
saved from the fire

482
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,631
and send them on to me at home.

483
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,829
Very well.

484
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,475
The news got to Madrid
quick enough.

485
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,878
-Should l go in?
-Not yet, no.

486
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:53,956
One thing

487
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,390
is improvising
to get out of a sticky situation,

488
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,591
quite another
is disobeying instructions.

489
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,189
When you go back in,
take up the protocol again

490
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,719
from the part
about the wedding rings.

491
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,191
The wedding rings, yes.

492
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,028
Carles?

493
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,673
What are you doing?

494
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,389
lt's a surprise.

495
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,955
-A surprise?
-Yes. Close your eyes.

496
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,636
But...

497
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,799
-Close your eyes.
-Okay, okay.

498
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,272
l'm watching you.

499
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,515
Now?

500
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,758
No, just a minute.

501
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,194
Whenever you're ready.

502
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,030
lt's my engagement present.

503
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,593
But if you don't like it,
l can get you a jewel.

504
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,837
lt's the most beautiful present
l've ever been given.

505
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,036
They seem real.

506
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,433
How did you do it?

507
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,513
No, don't tell me.
l'd rather not know.

508
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:29,989
Joana...

509
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,709
What?

510
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,113
Forgive me.

511
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,194
What for?

512
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,435
For having been so distant
all these years.

513
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:26,589
Are you all right?
ls something wrong?

514
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,268
My recollection of you
was so different.

515
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,919
Joana, we're not exactly
children any more.

516
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,668
The wedding ring.
l had to take your measurements.

517
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,391
Yes, that's right.

518
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,869
What's the matter?

519
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,632
Nothing. l thought you were
about to ''ask for my hand''.

520
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,070
Well,

521
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,035
in a way,
that's what l am doing.

522
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,838
Don't you see, Carles?

523
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,315
We're doing everything
the wrong way round!

524
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,595
You're right.

525
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,997
And it's all my fault.

526
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,039
Don't say that.

527
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,278
You and your dad always did that.

528
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,031
Exactly, it was something
between him and l.

529
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,674
Forgive me.
l didn't mean to upset you.

530
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,996
l'm sorry.
l miss him so much.

531
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,472
So do l, Joana.

532
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,629
So do l.

533
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,039
Anything else, sir?

534
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,276
No, thank you, you can go.

535
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:11,795
Teresa?

536
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,988
-Sir.
-Margarita. Excuse me.

537
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,673
Where is Doctor Meissner?

538
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,598
Actually, l don't know.

539
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,398
He should be in his bedroom.

540
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,509
Doctor.

541
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,632
Sir.
Can l help you with anything?

542
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,714
What would happen
if she had a problem in there?

543
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,995
One of her attacks?

544
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,636
lf what's worrying you
is the storm, l can assure you

545
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,595
her isolation is absolute.

546
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,030
Absolutely everything
has been taken care of.

547
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,190
lt's okay. Leave us.

548
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,030
Carry on eating.

549
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,589
l'm not hungry.

550
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,676
lt's obvious

551
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,275
that you don't lack
confidence in yourself.

552
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,515
Listen,

553
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,673
in less than twelve hours,

554
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,350
we have to return that girl
to the world she was living in.

555
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,593
lf you carry on playing

556
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,155
this passionate version
of Carles Lardin,

557
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,273
the original by her side
might suddenly look like

558
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,550
a cheap fake in comparison.

559
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:13,072
And neither you
nor l want that to happen.

560
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,358
For Joana's sake.

561
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,512
What do you want me to do now?

562
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:32,392
Enough beating about the bush.

563
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,555
When you go back in,
ask her directly about the formula.

564
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,113
And this time,
keep your enthusiasm under control.

565
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,028
What the hell?

566
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,315
What is it?

567
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,148
-lt's the thunder. She can hear it!
-Hear it?

568
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,635
Listen to me!
l don't care if she can hear it.

569
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,149
What concerns me
is that we can't hear her.

570
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,032
Everything's been taken care of.

571
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,868
We paid you to make
the cocoon soundproof, you idiot!

572
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,389
ln the original cocoon...
not this one.

573
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,592
There's a panic button.

574
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,711
A panic button?

575
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,595
Don't worry.
The button is irrelevant

576
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,392
because Joana won't be needing it.

577
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,110
Believe me,

578
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,956
that bell isn't going to ring.

579
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,828
Carles!

580
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:48,439
l understand you want to see her,
you miss her.

581
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,110
All of us worry about Joana.

582
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:53,394
Me as much as anyone.

583
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,678
Please forgive me,

584
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,034
l'm...

585
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:01,476
l'm...

586
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,596
Joana!

587
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:21,717
Joana, Joana.

588
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,800
lt's me. Carles. l'm here.

589
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,597
Everything the wrong way round.

590
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,190
Don't pull that face, Doctor.

591
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,151
Does it really surprise you?

592
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,035
This is our last day.
We've got to do something.

593
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,629
Of course
we're going to do something.

594
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,152
You can't harm her.
We made a deal.

595
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:38,515
lndeed we did,

596
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,439
and then you came up with

597
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,710
this ridiculous circus performance.

598
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,517
What happened?

599
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,197
How long have l been asleep?

600
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,835
l don't know.

601
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,871
You were so tired,
l didn't want to wake you.

602
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,429
What's that?

603
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,037
Daddy's photograph album.

604
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,114
Look, that's you
at Christmas mass.

605
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,673
And how do you know that's me?

606
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,519
l know this book off by heart,

607
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,030
and you're always the one
who's next to Dad.

608
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,953
Well, almost always.

609
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,594
This will be the first year
without him.

610
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,872
But now that Dad isn't here,

611
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,039
l suppose you'll be
the crown prince, won't you?

612
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,876
No, l'm just a faithful squire,

613
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,835
who will always protect you.

614
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:52,999
My faithful squire.

615
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,439
l like that.

616
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:18,555
l don't want you to worry,

617
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,190
but l need to tell you something.
lt's very important.

618
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,909
Joana?

619
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,473
Get the kid out of there.

620
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,069
He's had too many chances already.

621
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,430
What? No! Just a minute.

622
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,119
l said get him out of there now.

623
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,355
Carles?

624
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,878
l can't see you, Carles.

625
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:15,309
Carles?

626
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,630
Joana,

627
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,552
Joana, l'm not...

628
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,996
You're scaring me.
What's the matter?

629
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,276
What's wrong?

630
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,595
Listen to me.

631
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,399
There's no time.

632
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,230
l haven't found the courage
to tell you before now.

633
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:45,956
-l'm not...
-What?

634
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:48,279
We can't escape this.

635
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,519
-What are you talking about?
-The thing is...

636
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,309
l'm not...

637
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,599
lt's the business.

638
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,556
We're in a critical situation.

639
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,395
Because of the fire?

640
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:10,199
lt's not just that.

641
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:13,269
We've been operating at a loss
for months.

642
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,910
lf it continues, we'll have to close
Joana Lenses within the year.

643
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,275
But that can't be right.
Daddy never...

644
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,397
Your dad neverwanted
you to worry.

645
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,150
Listen, Joana,

646
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,150
l've been thinking about it

647
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,277
and l can only see one solution.

648
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,315
Manufacturing the catadioptric lens.

649
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:43,513
-He didn't want to.
-l wish there were anotherway,

650
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,157
but it's our only salvation.

651
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,996
lf we don't, we'll go bust.

652
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,992
Please, give me the formula.

653
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,114
What formula?

654
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,117
My dad never gave me any formula.

655
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,468
And all this...

656
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,355
was because
you wanted that formula?

657
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,752
How can you say that?

658
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:31,839
Don't you trust me?

659
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:52,915
Come here.

660
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,995
Come.

661
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,994
Sit down.

662
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,272
Close your eyes.

663
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:19,876
One.

664
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,229
Four.

665
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,435
Two.

666
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,635
Eight.

667
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,149
Seven.

668
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,115
Seven.

669
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,595
Nine.

670
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:54,709
Fantastic!

671
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:59,348
When l was a little girl and l went
to the factory with my father,

672
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,757
we used to pretend
l was helping him in the lab.

673
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:07,993
He always wrote those numbers
on the palm of my hand.

674
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,351
Always the same ones,
always in the same order.

675
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,275
l don't know.

676
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,629
Do you think
those numbers might be...?

677
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:25,309
l think so.

678
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,354
Joana,

679
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,836
l'm sorry it all had to be this way.

680
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,669
No, Carles. l know you're
only doing this to protect me.

681
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,033
l trust you.

682
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,070
Yes.

683
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,757
l have to get back to work.

684
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:16,869
l thought you'd gone
to the jeweller already.

685
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,509
Yes, l did.

686
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:23,432
lt's just l didn't want
to give it back.

687
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,236
l thought you'd want to keep it
until l give you the real one.

688
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:49,839
See you outside.

689
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,552
ln a short while,
my faithful squire.

690
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,555
The payment for your services
is in your room.

691
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,988
Don't be long.

692
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,075
Doctor?

693
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,238
What will happen to her now?

694
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,918
Don't worry.
She's sleeping peacefully,

695
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,279
and she's going to be fine,

696
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:29,357
as fine as she can be.

697
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:33,072
You can't cure her, can you?

698
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,275
All that stuff about the treatment
was lies.

699
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,635
Listen carefully, forthe last time.

700
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:27,197
Son of a bitch!

701
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:03,438
Look! Overthere!

702
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,594
What's all this?

703
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,279
Sir, l...

704
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,550
The police were here, sir.

705
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,432
The police?
What did they want?

706
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,473
-An escaped anarchist!
-They thought he was here.

707
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,558
They took us into the kitchen
while they searched the mansion!

708
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:57,431
That's enough.

709
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:05,470
Mr. Lardin!

710
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,036
There's a fellow here at the station
with a very strange story.

711
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,117
Yes, l know, an anarchist.

712
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,993
What?
No, he's not an anarchist,

713
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:15,918
not as far as l know.

714
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,038
l know this might sound strange,
but he's made a statement

715
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,629
saying he was forced to take part

716
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,354
in a plot to kidnap Joana Prats.

717
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,949
What are you talking about?

718
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,276
That's absurd!

719
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,438
Yes, but you understand
it's our duty to check out his story.

720
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:32,470
Hold on.

721
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:35,114
You came to my house
looking for an anarchist?

722
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,789
No, no.
What are you talking about?

723
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,476
We haven't been near your house.

724
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,791
But, Sir, it's still not time!

725
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,433
Go and find Dr. Meissner!

726
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:13,676
Joana?

727
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:28,675
Thank God.

728
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:33,913
-Are you alright?
-Of course l am!

729
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:37,549
l was so looking forward
to seeing you.

730
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:41,590
So, three days here on you own.

731
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,360
Yes, ''on my own''.

732
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,070
Doctor Meissner isn't here yet.
We'll have to wait a while.

733
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,955
Do you know what we could do?

734
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:03,029
No.

735
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,956
l see you're feeling better.

736
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,077
Do you notice anything different?

737
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,873
Everything is different.

738
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:24,314
You know what?

739
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,672
l think l've even got over
my fear of thunder storms.

740
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,758
Wait a moment.
You heard the thunder?

741
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,998
A little. lt was very distant.

742
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:44,637
Maybe l heard it because
l'm getting better.

743
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,109
Maybe.

744
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:49,516
Excuse me, sir.

745
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,836
Good morning.
l hate to interrupt...

746
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,674
lt's okay, darling.
Go about your business.

747
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,070
l'll see you later.

748
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,197
Marga, can you bring
some more butter, please?

749
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:06,794
Yes, Ma'am.

750
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,393
The entrance was here.

751
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:54,959
And her bed was there.

752
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:03,189
And they controlled it all
from up there.

753
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,515
They?

754
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:11,878
That's enough.

755
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,673
Let's get out of here.

756
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:26,675
Come in.

757
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,676
Sir, l don't mean to disturb you...

758
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,470
-What time is it?
-lt's seven o'clock.

759
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:37,513
Madam has already had dinner.
Would you like to have some?

760
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,392
No. Maybe later.

761
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,116
Has Doctor Meissner called?

762
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:48,071
-Shall l call the police?
-No, not forthe time being.

763
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,673
Thank you.

764
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,793
l think Marga almost saw me.

765
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,758
Joana!
What are you doing?

766
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:14,271
-l couldn't stand it anymore.
-What is it?

767
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,799
l had to see you.

768
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,956
Joana, the servants!

769
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,919
We'll be very quiet.

770
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,639
Be careful.

771
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,235
Careful.
Just take it slowly.

772
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,158
Joana, please, the books.

773
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,318
l was so scared
that it was alljust a dream,

774
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,718
these last three days.

775
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:37,194
l thought l wouldn't be able
to stand being locked up,

776
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,755
but when l saw you
come in the door,

777
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,435
l was simply dying for you
to walk in.

778
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,634
-You really mean that?
-Yes.

779
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:59,915
Carles...
Oh, Carles...

780
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:37,269
What is it, Joana?

781
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:38,755
Who are you?

782
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:42,072
Joana, it's me, darling.

783
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,759
lt's me.

784
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:47,357
Last night,
you seemed like someone else.

785
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,154
Last night?

786
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:09,949
Well?

787
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,119
l know it isn't pleasant.

788
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,151
lt's a load of rubbish.

789
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,116
However, this man seems to have
a lot of information on you.

790
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,475
From having worked in my house.

791
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,594
Well, that's what he claims.

792
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,956
You don't give this any credibility?

793
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,639
Absolutely none whatsoever.

794
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,635
ln any case, it's easy to check
whether he everworked in my house.

795
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,949
ls Joana all right?

796
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,670
How could you do
something like that?

797
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,757
They didn't give me much choice.

798
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:40,195
They knew everything about you.
Everything except that damn formula.

799
01:24:40,680 --> 01:24:42,398
That formula doesn't exist.

800
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,478
Joana gave it to me.

801
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,553
They wanted to torture her.

802
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,593
l did it to save her.

803
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:52,394
Save her? You?

804
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:56,630
-She doesn't even know you exist.
-Ask her about that.

805
01:24:57,640 --> 01:25:00,154
-What are you saying?
-You don't deserve her.

806
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,197
You don't respect her as a woman.

807
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,038
You can't give her
what she wants.

808
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:08,596
One day, she'll work out that
you're not the man she was with.

809
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,435
And by then l won't be in here.

810
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:15,557
There's no proof against me.

811
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,950
lf you want to accuse me
of something,

812
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,429
you'll have to let Joana explain

813
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,108
what happened between us
to the whole world.

814
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,591
lf you go anywhere near her again,

815
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,712
l swearto God l'll kill you!

816
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,672
l'll kill you.

817
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,833
Everything alright?

818
01:26:32,680 --> 01:26:33,999
Out, out.

819
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,636
How could you?

820
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:19,115
How could
something like this happen?

821
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,436
lt makes my head spin.

822
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:30,635
Did you know that good-for-nothing
worked in this house?

823
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,833
Vicent!
The servant we dismissed!

824
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:44,030
l see you remember
the bastard well enough.

825
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:47,517
Carles, l swearto God
that l thought it was you!

826
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:49,509
l swear.

827
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,155
Well, l'm afraid
that's not the way it was.

828
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,675
Carles, wait.

829
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:13,112
l wanted it to be you
with all my heart.

830
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:45,119
Mister Lardin.

831
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,236
Bitch.

832
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:52,149
l'm with guests.

833
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:54,794
lf you have something
you'd like to say to me...

834
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:05,909
You...

835
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:09,993
and Meissner and that servant...

836
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:13,997
have taken everything from me.

837
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,031
l have nothing left.

838
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:23,351
Mister Lardin,

839
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:29,317
get married, sell the business,

840
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,918
and stop worrying,

841
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:35,674
l never leave loose ends.

842
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:33,838
Happy Christmas, sir.

843
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:52,074
Mister Lardin, Mister Lardin...

844
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,149
Happy Christmas.

845
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:58,920
We are very sad about
the loss of Mr. Prats.

846
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:06,115
Joana.

847
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,155
Joana!

848
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:37,917
lt's you!

849
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,913
Stop or l'll shoot!

850
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:11,515
Joana!

851
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,350
No!

852
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,631
Joana, Joana...

853
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:35,514
Are you okay?

854
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,188
lt's me.

855
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:41,273
ls it you?

856
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:46,555
Oh, my God.

857
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:49,274
Fetch a doctor!
Somebody find a doctor!

858
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:53,435
What is it?
What do you want?

859
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:58,952
Leave me.

860
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:52,039
Joana.

861
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,109
Joana?

862
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:00,628
Joana.

863
01:38:03,800 --> 01:38:04,994
l'm here.

864
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:09,392
-Carles?
-No.

865
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:12,920
No, Joana, it's me.

866
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:45,278
My faithful squire.
