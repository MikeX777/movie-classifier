1
00:00:00,287 --> 00:00:03,287
 - Good morning.
 What's the mother's name?

2
00:00:17,687 --> 00:00:20,687
 - Good morning.
 What's the mother's name?

3
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:23,927
 Erna Sveinsdottir.
 - Hold on.

4
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:49,367
 PARENTS

5
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:02,446
 Are you having it like that?
 - Isn't it cute?

6
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:05,447
 No,
 let's skip the candy.

7
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:09,087
 It's nice as it is.
 The guests will arrive soon.

8
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:19,927
 Mom, are you trying to kill me?
 This is really uncomfortable.

9
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:24,567
 Baldur!
 What are you saying child?

10
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:30,007
 It's just for today.
 Sit down and take a load off.

11
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:36,127
 Grandma's going to
 get you something special.

12
00:01:54,487 --> 00:01:57,487
 Listen Baldur,
 I was thinking- 

13
00:01:59,247 --> 00:02:01,966
 This is from grandma.

14
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:04,967
 Wait, wait...

15
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:08,566
 There you go.

16
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:11,567
 Happy birthday to you.
 Happy birthday to you.

17
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,767
 Happy birthday dear Baldur.
 Happy birthday to you.

18
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:28,566
 Listen Baldur,
 I...

19
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:31,567
 I ordered mine from abroad,
 but it hasn't arrived yet.

20
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:34,806
 Is that okay?
 - Sure.

21
00:02:34,807 --> 00:02:37,807
 Great...

22
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:04,927
 I'll help you blow out
 the candles later.

23
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:08,407
 That's a lot of candles, huh?
 - There are eleven candles!

24
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:12,527
 - Don't touch
 the icing Baldur!

25
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:16,047
 Wait, not just yet.
 I forgot the camera.

26
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:19,926
 Katrin dear,
 come take a picture.

27
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:22,927
 - You should take the picture,
 "The Family Photographer".

28
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:26,967
 There you go dear.
 Just push the 'on' button.

29
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:31,567
 Push until the focus is clear,
 then you push...

30
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:35,367
 Push again, but you have to
 wait for the focus.

31
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,687
 How's is it going abroad?
 - Just great.

32
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:55,047
 It demands
 a lot of my time.

33
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:58,167
 Thank you.

34
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,007
 It's great to see you guys.
 - You too. You look great.

35
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:06,807
 Thanks.

36
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:09,886
 - How's Sweden these days?

37
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:12,887
 - Same as always.
 I've been there so long.

38
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:17,966
 Katrin...

39
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:20,566
 Yes, right.
 What?

40
00:04:20,567 --> 00:04:23,366
 For me?

41
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:26,367
 Hi?
 - Katrin, Katrin..!

42
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:37,047
 Johan?
 - You fucking cunt!

43
00:04:37,287 --> 00:04:40,287
 I... I can explain- 
 - I stand here waiting for you.

44
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,326
 Yes, sorry. I can explain.
 It's my son's birthday.

45
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,406
 - What the hell
 is wrong with you!

46
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:49,046
 I have to be here- 
 - You fucking cunt!

47
00:04:49,047 --> 00:04:52,047
 I'm sorry, so sorry.
 - Fuck.

48
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:55,127
 - I trusted you to return,
 but you have betrayed me!

49
00:04:56,607 --> 00:04:58,446
 No, I haven't- 
 - You have betrayed me!

50
00:04:58,447 --> 00:05:01,447
 - You have betrayed me!
 Understand?!

51
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:04,926
 - I go to the airport
 and you don't show up!

52
00:05:04,927 --> 00:05:07,927
 I'm sorry, I meant to call.
 - You whore!

53
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:10,046
 I...

54
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:12,006
 There you are!

55
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:14,526
 You have to say goodbye.
 - I'm coming.

56
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:16,406
 The guests are leaving.

57
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:18,646
 Simmi and Pala are waiting
 to say goodbye to you.

58
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:21,647
 Come on then.
 - Yes.

59
00:05:21,687 --> 00:05:23,126
 - Hear what I'm saying!

60
00:05:23,127 --> 00:05:25,086
 Johan,
 can I call you back- 

61
00:05:25,087 --> 00:05:27,726
 - You take the next plane
 to Stockholm, understand?

62
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:30,366
 I can't do that.
 - You will come tomorrow.

63
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:32,566
 - Understand! Tomorrow!
 - I can't come tomorrow.

64
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:34,606
 - This is the last time
 I'll wait for you.

65
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:37,607
 - Do you understand?
 - The last time!

66
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:42,247
 - Am I making myself clear?
 - Yes... Yes, I understand.

67
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,527
 - Say: I'll come tomorrow Johan.Say it!

68
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:48,927
 - Say it!
 - Johan... I'll come tomorrow.

69
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:06,047
 - Breathe in...
 And now we're flying.

70
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:09,647
 - We're flying as a group.

71
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:13,487
 - The young in the middle
 and the strong keep point.

72
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:14,287
 - Elvar, I need to use
 the bathroom.

73
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:18,487
 It's me.
 - Oskar? I really need to go.

74
00:07:19,927 --> 00:07:22,927
 Use the one downstairs.
 - Mom is in the shower.

75
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:27,327
 This one's occupied.
 Just, go outside or something.

76
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:30,687
 - What's wrong with you?

77
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:39,967
 Oskar, can you pick me up
 after gymnastics?

78
00:07:41,807 --> 00:07:44,807
 When are you done?
 - About five o'clock.

79
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:48,767
 Sure, I'll be there.

80
00:07:49,847 --> 00:07:52,847
 Mom, can I get
 a new swimsuit?

81
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:56,047
 Swimsuit? Isn't the one
 you have good enough?

82
00:07:56,807 --> 00:07:59,807
 No, it's ugly.
 - Don't be silly. It looks great.

83
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:03,846
 Mom?!
 - Not now.

84
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:06,847
 You can, when we go
 to Italy next summer.

85
00:08:08,527 --> 00:08:11,527
 This one will do for now.
 End of discussion.

86
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:14,567
 Can you do a somersault?
 Learnt that in gymnastics?

87
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:18,087
 Yeah.
 - Really?

88
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:21,487
 You should have
 seen her the other day.

89
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,127
 I couldn't make it.
 - That's okay.

90
00:09:13,447 --> 00:09:16,447
 They're happy with
 the current terms.

91
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:19,166
 Yes.

92
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,566
 I told them
 it was binding, so...

93
00:09:21,567 --> 00:09:24,567
 We need to get it
 in writing.

94
00:09:25,687 --> 00:09:28,687
 No later than
 tomorrow.

95
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,087
 Hey. Twelve grand
 on one hand.

96
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:35,527
 On just one hand.
 - Yes... Exactly.

97
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:49,926
 Well...

98
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:52,927
 Are you going to
 show dad your drawing?

99
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,167
 Want to put your jacket on?
 - I'm so tired.

100
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,926
 I think your dad
 is on his way.

101
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:06,206
 - It's on the top shelf.

102
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,207
 Do you see it?
 Bottom of the heap.

103
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:16,526
 Nine- thirty...

104
00:10:16,527 --> 00:10:19,446
 You have to be there.
 Gauti doesn't know anything.

105
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:22,447
 I won't worry about it then.
 Bye.

106
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:27,727
 Do we need to go to grandma?
 - Yeah, come on.

107
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,126
 You're a bit late.
 - Yes, couldn't make it sooner.

108
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:34,127
 This happens a bit too often.
 - What?

109
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:35,846
 That you arrive late.

110
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:38,847
 Yeah,
 I was busy at work.

111
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:43,367
 I should be busy too.
 - Yes, but you work here, right?

112
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:47,246
 Yes, but we're closed now.
 I'm here on my spare time.

113
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,406
 Okay.

114
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:51,407
 It can't go on like this.

115
00:10:52,847 --> 00:10:55,847
 It's not an option for parents
 to be repeatedly late.

116
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,127
 Not an option?
 Okay.

117
00:11:00,287 --> 00:11:03,287
 - Fine by me.

118
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,207
 Hello!
 Welcome.

119
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,967
 I'll just pick her up
 Monday morning.

120
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,886
 First thing.
 - Einar?

121
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:24,086
 What's going on
 with you?

122
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:25,966
 I'm not- 
 - Halla called me.

123
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:28,086
 And what?
 - What are you thinking?

124
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,526
 This isn't your problem.
 She needs a little space,

125
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:33,486
 A little time to
 get her head straight.

126
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:35,966
 Everything will be okay.
 Don't get involved!

127
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:38,967
 It's none of your business.
 Seriously.

128
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,726
 Can you take care of
 the girl over the weekend?

129
00:11:41,727 --> 00:11:43,606
 Of course I can honey,
 you know that.

130
00:11:43,607 --> 00:11:45,126
 That's what I need,
 Okay?

131
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:47,966
 People are waiting for me
 at work. See you later.

132
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,967
 All right dear.
 - Bye.

133
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:15,487
 Oskar Sveinn?
 Do you have the...

134
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:18,927
 Yeah...
 Thanks.

135
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:24,047
 - Sorry!
 Dear Lord, that was clumsy.

136
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:27,366
 No, it was my fault.
 - I'm sorry.

137
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,246
 Do you have something
 to clean this up with?

138
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:32,247
 Of course.
 Excuse me.

139
00:12:34,247 --> 00:12:36,246
 I'm so terribly clumsy.
 - I'll do it.

140
00:12:36,247 --> 00:12:37,966
 This is so embarrassing.
 It's my entire fault.

141
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:40,446
 It wasn't your fault.

142
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:42,926
 I'll bring
 a new one tomorrow.

143
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:45,927
 That'll be no trouble.

144
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:50,927
 Can I borrow that?
 - Yeah.

145
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:53,446
 Listen...

146
00:12:53,447 --> 00:12:56,447
 If you want to
 get it over with today...

147
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:01,167
 Then...
 I'll take that.

148
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:04,607
 You can have privacy,
 in the bathroom there.

149
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,407
 - That is, if you want
 to finish this today?

150
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:12,127
 Yes, I'll do it now.
 Do you have a new container?

151
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:15,327
 Certainly.

152
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:31,886
 Good morning.

153
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:34,887
 Morning, how do you do?
 You're the new one?

154
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:39,087
 Yes. Katrin Rose.
 - I'm Oskar Sveinn.

155
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:42,247
 I'm the other dentist.
 - Right...

156
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:45,407
 Orn told me you might
 start today, I just forgot.

157
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:51,487
 How's it going?
 Getting into swing of things?

158
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:54,887
 Yeah, it's going great.
 - Good.

159
00:13:57,047 --> 00:14:00,047
 Listen, I feel like
 I know you from somewhere?

160
00:14:00,847 --> 00:14:03,847
 Do you recognize me?

161
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:10,007
 Are you a former patient?
 - No...

162
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,567
 Are you from Hunavatn County?
 - No no.

163
00:14:15,207 --> 00:14:18,046
 Okay, sorry about that.
 - Hi!

164
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:21,047
 - Hi! You are early.
 Is is Arnor?

165
00:14:22,287 --> 00:14:24,526
 - Yes.
 - Hi.

166
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:26,926
 - My, how you've grown!

167
00:14:26,927 --> 00:14:29,927
 - Take a seat for a minute.
 I need to prepare.

168
00:14:31,007 --> 00:14:34,007
 Won't take a second.
 - No problem.

169
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:51,567
 Do they call you dad yet?
 - They don't have to.

170
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:55,807
 Sure.
 I was just curious.

171
00:14:56,207 --> 00:14:59,207
 They're so grown now.

172
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:04,247
 They meet their dad regularly,
 don't they?

173
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:08,447
 Of course.
 - From time to time.

174
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:12,407
 - No plans on having
 one of your own?

175
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:17,487
 Well,
 who knows.

176
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,847
 - Johan.
 - Hi, hi.

177
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:01,486
 Did I wake you?

178
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,487
 Sorry, I didn't mean to.
 - Who is this?

179
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:06,766
 Sorry... What?
 - Who is this?

180
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:09,286
 This is Katrin.

181
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:12,287
 - What do you want?

182
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:17,847
 I...
 I need to tell you something.

183
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:24,447
 I have decided...

184
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:28,927
 I've decided
 to stay in Iceland.

185
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:36,087
 I think it's best that I
 take care of my son and...

186
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:41,726
 Johan?

187
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,727
 - Think I'm just
 waiting for you?

188
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:48,207
 - I don't need you.

189
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:49,686
 No?

190
00:17:49,687 --> 00:17:52,687
 - Stay in Iceland.
 I can get any woman I want.

191
00:17:54,927 --> 00:17:57,927
 - Do you think you mean
 so much to me?

192
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:02,687
 No, I'm not saying that.
 I just thought- 

193
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:06,486
 - Right.

194
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:09,487
 - Just do
 what you will.

195
00:18:42,447 --> 00:18:45,447
 Trunk's out!
 Everyone's there, the principal,

196
00:18:46,087 --> 00:18:49,087
 his wife next to him.
 Guy was expelled on the spot!

197
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:52,887
 We had a guy that was always
 hanging around our team.

198
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,967
 We duped him into
 being a sort of a "helper".

199
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,766
 We made him do
 "The Elephant"- 

200
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:03,006
 A Sidekick.
 - Yeah, a Sidekick.

201
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:06,007
 And as he was
 pulling his thing out

202
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:10,007
 someone had a camera
 and took a picture of- 

203
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:13,127
 Isn't that you wife?

204
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,486
 Yeah...

205
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,487
 The guy was sort of...
 His name was Orvar- 

206
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,807
 Aren't you going to talk to her?
 - Yeah... In a moment.

207
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:30,287
 Can you order me a coffee?

208
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:34,167
 Sure. A double Espresso?
 - Yes.

209
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:38,047
 The grammar's hard so...
 - I think you're doing great.

210
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:42,287
 Thank you.

211
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:46,407
 Hi.
 - Hi.

212
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:51,967
 How's everything?
 - Good, I'm in a meeting Einar.

213
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:56,166
 A meeting? For what?
 - Work.

214
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,846
 Hi.
 - I'm John.

215
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:00,646
 I'm Einar,
 her husband.

216
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:03,647
 Don't you need papers
 if you are having a meeting?

217
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:06,687
 Einar, this is a meeting.
 - Why here?

218
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:08,966
 Why not here?

219
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:11,166
 - I'm always here for lunch.

220
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,966
 Oh come on, Einar I- 

221
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:15,967
 Don't tell me you did
 come here on purpose?

222
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,966
 What's wrong with you?
 - Just admit it!

223
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,406
 You knew I'd be here
 having lunch.

224
00:20:22,407 --> 00:20:24,206
 Einar, no!
 Don't act this way.

225
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:27,207
 What do you do?
 - I direct...commercials.

226
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:31,767
 You're not Icelandic?
 - No, I'm from Ireland.

227
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:35,566
 Ireland? OK.

228
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,567
 Don't let me interrupt,
 just continue.

229
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:42,727
 I'm just checking up on you- 
 - I can see that you are- 

230
00:20:43,247 --> 00:20:46,247
 You knew I'd come over, right?
 - Of course not, I- 

231
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:49,206
 You knew
 I'd be here!

232
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:51,966
 Don't pretend
 you didn't know.

233
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:54,086
 Einar, would you stop this- 
 - What's this bullshit?!

234
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:57,087
 This isn't a meeting.
 Where did you find this guy?

235
00:20:58,167 --> 00:20:59,686
 Coffee?

236
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:02,687
 Why don't you get Irish coffee?
 Aren't you Irish?

237
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:05,767
 Einar, don't!
 - You knew I'd be here!

238
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:08,927
 That's why you are here!
 Why are you provoking me?

239
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:12,447
 - Why don't we talk,
 instead of this provocation?!

240
00:21:15,087 --> 00:21:18,087
 You knew I'd be here!

241
00:21:18,287 --> 00:21:19,886
 You could have called!

242
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:22,686
 I wait by the phone
 weeks on end.

243
00:21:22,687 --> 00:21:24,646
 Why can't you just call?!

244
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:26,766
 Would you please stop!
 - Why are you doing this?!

245
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:28,446
 - Not so loudly!

246
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:31,447
 Don't dare provoke me!
 Do you hear?

247
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:34,847
 One phone call!

248
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:17,646
 Kids!
 - Yes?

249
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:20,647
 Don't play on the street.
 - You can pass by us.

250
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:24,086
 You should be
 at the playground.

251
00:22:24,087 --> 00:22:26,406
 It's so boring there.

252
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:29,407
 You shouldn't play here.
 - Just drive past us.

253
00:22:39,327 --> 00:22:41,606
 Hello?
 - Hi there.

254
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:44,607
 The designer stopped by
 to check out the bathroom.

255
00:22:46,647 --> 00:22:49,647
 He said the tiles would
 be in on Monday.

256
00:22:50,167 --> 00:22:52,846
 Then we can get
 the ball rolling.

257
00:22:52,847 --> 00:22:55,446
 - Great.

258
00:22:55,447 --> 00:22:58,366
 I decided on
 the lighter color.

259
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:01,006
 I trust you implicitly.

260
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:03,006
 What's the occasion?

261
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,007
 I thought we'd have some
 Champagne. It's five o'clock.

262
00:23:06,487 --> 00:23:09,286
 What..?

263
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:12,287
 I just got some test results.
 - Is everything okay?

264
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:15,966
 - Everything is terrific.

265
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:18,967
 I've got...
 great sperm.

266
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:23,486
 Great.
 Congratulations.

267
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:26,487
 I have incredible virile
 and vivacious semen.

268
00:23:26,887 --> 00:23:29,606
 Great.
 - In no way sluggish.

269
00:23:29,607 --> 00:23:32,607
 And because of that
 I wanted to celebrate.

270
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,686
 I'm not drinking now.
 - Why not?

271
00:23:36,687 --> 00:23:39,687
 I have to pick up Elvar.
 And I have work tonight.

272
00:23:39,727 --> 00:23:42,727
 Oh?

273
00:23:48,047 --> 00:23:49,686
 That's too bad.

274
00:23:49,687 --> 00:23:52,687
 We're just too tense, Oskar.
 And I'm too old.

275
00:23:53,367 --> 00:23:55,926
 I'm not tense.

276
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:58,927
 And you're
 not too old.

277
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:07,367
 Are we trying to
 have a baby together, or?

278
00:24:07,807 --> 00:24:10,006
 Yes, we are.

279
00:24:10,007 --> 00:24:13,007
 Wouldn't it be clever
 if you'd have some tests done?

280
00:24:13,927 --> 00:24:16,806
 I already have Oskar.
 I'm fine!

281
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:19,807
 We're just getting too old.
 - No we're not. We're young.

282
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:23,767
 Okay, I'll go and have
 another checkup, okay?

283
00:24:26,767 --> 00:24:29,767
 I'm going to pick Elvar up.

284
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:42,247
 That's a foul, referee!
 Are you asleep?

285
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:46,047
 - Put on your glasses!

286
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:08,247
 You were great, the best!
 I'll wait by the car, dear.

287
00:25:19,127 --> 00:25:22,127
 I think it'd be best if
 Baldur came to live with me.

288
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,486
 It's time to
 take that step, mom.

289
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:28,086
 You and Baldur?
 - Yes.

290
00:25:28,087 --> 00:25:30,726
 Don't you think
 he's suffered enough?

291
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:32,726
 Are you going to
 uproot him now,

292
00:25:32,727 --> 00:25:35,727
 when there's finally
 some balance in his life?

293
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:51,727
 "Come home,
 I miss you."

294
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:03,487
 It's been four years
 since your last checkup?

295
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:06,166
 Yeah...
 Maybe not four exactly- 

296
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:08,966
 Aren't you notified
 every six months?

297
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,967
 Yeah,
 but they call...

298
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:15,407
 Why don't you show up
 when you get a call?

299
00:26:24,527 --> 00:26:27,527
 This look awful,
 holes everywhere.

300
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:34,007
 - You should floss.
 - Yes...

301
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:36,286
 You have to floss.

302
00:26:36,287 --> 00:26:38,846
 - I'm off then.

303
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,806
 All right. Bye.

304
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:44,807
 I've tried flossing, but...

305
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:47,806
 Listen...

306
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:50,807
 It hurts when I floss.
 And it bleeds.

307
00:26:54,007 --> 00:26:57,007
 Should it bleed?

308
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:05,447
 - Baldur?

309
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:08,687
 Listen...

310
00:27:11,247 --> 00:27:12,926
 I was thinking...

311
00:27:12,927 --> 00:27:15,927
 If we'd move
 into a new place together?

312
00:27:16,447 --> 00:27:18,406
 Just me and you?

313
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:20,246
 Then you could...

314
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:23,247
 You'd get
 your own room...

315
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:26,246
 And a new bed,
 maybe?

316
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:29,247
 No... Grandma
 would be all alone.

317
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:33,407
 I don't want that.

318
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:42,246
 Can't we just
 skip bowling?

319
00:27:42,247 --> 00:27:45,126
 I want to go play soccer
 with my friends.

320
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:48,127
 I asked, what you wanted to do,
 and you said bowling?

321
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:54,807
 I'm trying here.

322
00:27:57,007 --> 00:28:00,007
 Can't you just go
 back to Sweden?

323
00:28:04,087 --> 00:28:06,166
 No...

324
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:08,646
 Why are you
 making this so difficult?

325
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:11,046
 Don't you like
 having me around?

326
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:14,047
 You know I'm your mom.
 I want to be your mom.

327
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:20,326
 Why are you
 acting this way?

328
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:23,327
 - Wait,
 don't go...

329
00:28:31,487 --> 00:28:33,086
 - You're not right
 in the head!

330
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:36,087
 - You fuck up every time
 they visit you.

331
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:41,886
 - Yes, damn it!

332
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,887
 - You're just lucky I could
 pick them up at the airport.

333
00:28:44,927 --> 00:28:47,927
 - And what about that woman,
 was she with you?

334
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:54,967
 - She's pregnant?

335
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:59,287
 - Oh, really,
 you always wanted more?

336
00:29:01,127 --> 00:29:04,127
 - Fucking bullshit,
 you're lying through your teeth.

337
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:07,606
 - It was you
 and your family...

338
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:10,607
 that convinced me
 to get my tubes tied!

339
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:13,727
 - And I was stupid enough
 to listen to you fucking idiots!

340
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,046
 Is there a problem?

341
00:29:30,047 --> 00:29:33,047
 No, just the same old story.
 Addi and the kids...

342
00:29:34,767 --> 00:29:37,767
 He sent them home by plane...

343
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:39,406
 All alone.

344
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:42,407
 They're completely devastated,
 and I'm really upset.

345
00:29:49,447 --> 00:29:52,447
 I think I'm going
 to go for a swim.

346
00:29:58,127 --> 00:30:01,127
 - Get the hell out Oskar!

347
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:52,647
 - Hi.
 Hi.

348
00:31:57,487 --> 00:32:00,487
 Where's Baldur?

349
00:32:01,207 --> 00:32:03,446
 He's not here yet?

350
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:06,447
 I thought he was
 with you?

351
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:10,727
 He was acting
 a bit childish...

352
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:13,767
 He should be home
 soon enough.

353
00:32:14,647 --> 00:32:17,446
 What do you mean, childish?
 Where is he?

354
00:32:17,447 --> 00:32:20,447
 We went to the docks
 and he became a bit upset.

355
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,046
 The docks?
 - Yes.

356
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:27,047
 You left him at the docks?
 - No, I didn't. He ran away.

357
00:32:30,007 --> 00:32:33,007
 Dear Lord...
 At the docks?!

358
00:32:33,127 --> 00:32:35,846
 He could fall
 into the ocean.

359
00:32:35,847 --> 00:32:38,847
 He's not used to
 being at the docks.

360
00:32:38,887 --> 00:32:40,966
 You're a completely
 unfit mother!

361
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:43,967
 I'm an unfit mother?!
 - Yes, you- 

362
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,087
 Are you completely senseless?
 Try to be a little helpful!

363
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:52,327
 I didn't leave my son.
 Do you think I'm insane?

364
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:55,366
 What's wrong with you?
 - What's wrong with me?

365
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:57,206
 Yes, you leave your son
 at the docks and...

366
00:32:57,207 --> 00:33:00,207
 I didn't leave him there!
 Didn't you hear me?

367
00:33:00,407 --> 00:33:03,407
 Yes, he ran away
 and then you come here- 

368
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:05,206
 Yes!

369
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:07,206
 That means he's alone,
 wandering- 

370
00:33:07,207 --> 00:33:09,646
 I'm an unfit mother?
 What about you?

371
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:12,166
 Do you think you're
 The Perfect Mom?

372
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:15,086
 I'm considered a...
 Maybe not perfect.

373
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:16,846
 No one is perfect.

374
00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:19,006
 But I've been considered
 a competent mom.

375
00:33:19,007 --> 00:33:21,806
 That's what you think?
 God, how happy am I?

376
00:33:21,807 --> 00:33:24,366
 See how bloody well
 you did with me?!

377
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:26,686
 It's not my fault that
 you're not happy now.

378
00:33:26,687 --> 00:33:29,686
 You were happy as a child,
 got everything you asked for.

379
00:33:29,687 --> 00:33:32,687
 Baldur!
 - Baldur, my dear Baldur!

380
00:33:33,407 --> 00:33:35,926
 How did you get here?
 Did you take the bus?

381
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:38,927
 You hitched a ride?
 He hitched a ride!

382
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:42,727
 I heard.

383
00:33:47,087 --> 00:33:49,846
 - You should never hitch a ride.
 It's very dangerous!

384
00:33:49,847 --> 00:33:52,847
 - Aren't you cold?
 Who gave you a lift?

385
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:56,567
 - Some old lady.
 - Some old lady? Thank God.

386
00:35:17,687 --> 00:35:20,687
 It was just
 one weekend!

387
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:23,846
 And you go
 and throw a party?

388
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:26,847
 Not a real party?
 What was then?

389
00:35:28,207 --> 00:35:31,207
 Oh yes, yes it was.
 You were dead drunk!

390
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:35,007
 Elvar didn't sleep all night,
 he was so scared.

391
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:38,887
 Yes...yes...yes.

392
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:41,766
 No...No!

393
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:44,767
 Your son had
 a bad asthma fit.

394
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:39,686
 Hi.
 - Hi.

395
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:42,687
 Thanks for coming.
 - No problem.

396
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:46,607
 Are you okay?

397
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,807
 I've tried listening
 many times.

398
00:36:53,287 --> 00:36:54,926
 She's the one
 who doesn't listen.

399
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:57,927
 Wait a minute.
 You know...

400
00:37:00,127 --> 00:37:03,127
 There's your side of things.
 And then there's hers.

401
00:37:06,127 --> 00:37:09,127
 Which is just as important
 as yours.

402
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:13,207
 You have to tell your side.
 And she has to tell hers.

403
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:20,087
 And you
 have to listen.

404
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:23,247
 You can also,
 you know...

405
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:27,327
 Use your daughter
 as leverage.

406
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:31,286
 Especially now when
 she's accusing you...

407
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:34,287
 Of not being there
 for the family.

408
00:37:34,767 --> 00:37:37,767
 You can try, while
 she's thinking things over,

409
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:42,566
 to get close
 with your daughter.

410
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:45,567
 Then she'll see
 your nice side.

411
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:49,687
 If you connect better
 with your daughter... like...

412
00:37:50,887 --> 00:37:53,446
 You can take her to...

413
00:37:53,447 --> 00:37:56,447
 I don't know...
 Maybe buy her...

414
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:59,886
 A puppy or something...

415
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:02,887
 To make a point of...

416
00:38:06,527 --> 00:38:08,926
 And that would mean,
 you know...

417
00:38:08,927 --> 00:38:11,927
 Each time
 she sees that puppy...

418
00:38:14,607 --> 00:38:17,006
 She'll think of you.

419
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:20,007
 And she'd see
 your new side.

420
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:23,487
 Yeah.
 - Get it?

421
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,406
 Howdy.

422
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:41,407
 Where's your car?
 - The car?

423
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:44,767
 I don't own one now.
 This is the real stuff.

424
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:48,046
 You bought this?
 - Yup, isn't it great?

425
00:38:48,047 --> 00:38:49,846
 You're not driving
 the kids on that?

426
00:38:49,847 --> 00:38:52,847
 On this? No.
 - Phew, for a moment there- 

427
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:55,966
 No, no, that's too dangerous.
 It's just for me.

428
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,686
 A buddy of mine
 is on his way.

429
00:38:57,687 --> 00:39:00,126
 He'll take the bike
 and I get his car.

430
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:02,086
 Shouldn't I just
 give them a lift?

431
00:39:02,087 --> 00:39:05,087
 No, he's already
 on his way.

432
00:39:05,687 --> 00:39:08,687
 He's probably lost
 or something

433
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:12,167
 Do you have
 some cash on you?

434
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:14,806
 I'm a bit short
 at the moment.

435
00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:16,806
 Just to get me
 over the weekend?

436
00:39:16,807 --> 00:39:19,086
 Just 'til I get paid?

437
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:21,326
 It's always the same
 with you, Addi?

438
00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:23,566
 I have my ups
 and downs.

439
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:25,726
 I wanted to do
 something with the kids.

440
00:40:29,807 --> 00:40:32,807
 - according to Matti Vanhanen,
 the Finnish Prime Minister.

441
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:36,527
 - Finland will lead the ESB
 from the 1st of July...

442
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:41,327
 Finland..?
 Finland!

443
00:40:57,687 --> 00:41:00,687
 See what daddy brought you!
 Don't I get a kiss?

444
00:41:05,847 --> 00:41:08,847
 Look at him,
 isn't he cute?

445
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:14,966
 Hi.
 - How are you?

446
00:41:14,967 --> 00:41:17,286
 Did you just bring a cat?
 - Yes.

447
00:41:17,287 --> 00:41:19,486
 Have you completely lost it?
 - What do you mean?

448
00:41:19,487 --> 00:41:21,086
 What are you thinking?

449
00:41:21,087 --> 00:41:23,846
 She's wanted a pet
 for such a long time.

450
00:41:23,847 --> 00:41:26,847
 No, she hasn't.
 - Yes, she has.

451
00:41:27,607 --> 00:41:30,046
 Yeah, he's cute!

452
00:41:30,047 --> 00:41:33,047
 Einar, what's wrong with you?
 - What, come on.

453
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:37,407
 Miniature hamster?
 - Yes.

454
00:41:46,887 --> 00:41:49,166
 You're putting me on!
 - No, I'm not!

455
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:52,167
 You're not allergic to cats.
 - Yes, I am!

456
00:41:52,447 --> 00:41:55,447
 Since when?

457
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:03,447
 What's wrong with you
 Einar?

458
00:42:03,807 --> 00:42:06,807
 Don't be this way.
 Can't she play with it today?

459
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:10,327
 I can pick it up
 later tonight.

460
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:24,367
 Allergic?

461
00:42:37,127 --> 00:42:40,127
 - Katrin?

462
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:44,047
 I've got an awkward thing
 I need to get over with.

463
00:42:46,047 --> 00:42:49,047
 I suddenly recalled where
 we've met before, and...

464
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,727
 I'm really sorry,
 I didn't remember.

465
00:42:53,647 --> 00:42:56,206
 It's no problem.

466
00:42:56,207 --> 00:42:59,207
 Yes, it is.

467
00:43:01,327 --> 00:43:04,286
 To explain
 why I couldn't remember...

468
00:43:04,287 --> 00:43:06,766
 Well...
 I was so drunk.

469
00:43:06,767 --> 00:43:09,767
 Also, it's such
 a long time ago.

470
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:13,646
 About eleven years,
 Right?

471
00:43:13,647 --> 00:43:16,166
 I'm not sure.

472
00:43:16,167 --> 00:43:19,167
 - Right.

473
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,807
 Well, those parties
 can get crazy.

474
00:43:27,407 --> 00:43:30,407
 It's why memories
 get a bit messed up.

475
00:43:32,687 --> 00:43:35,687
 And Finland of course.
 Finland...

476
00:43:38,007 --> 00:43:41,007
 Well anyway.
 I apologize.

477
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:45,287
 Bjarni is here.

478
00:43:45,407 --> 00:43:48,006
 I'm going to
 grab an apple.

479
00:43:48,007 --> 00:43:51,007
 You get him ready.
 I'll just be a minute.

480
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:57,486
 Bjarni?

481
00:43:57,487 --> 00:44:00,487
 Come on in.

482
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,926
 Just take a seat.

483
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:06,927
 Can I put my jacket here?
 - Yes.

484
00:44:16,647 --> 00:44:19,647
 Do you think he'll fix all
 the holes now, or just one?

485
00:44:22,167 --> 00:44:25,167
 I have this presentation
 later at work, you see.

486
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:30,767
 It would be bad if
 my whole mouth was numb.

487
00:44:31,647 --> 00:44:34,647
 If the tongue was...
 It's an important presentation.

488
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:38,766
 So it'd be best if
 he'd do just one now.

489
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:41,767
 I could come back
 for the rest.

490
00:44:43,327 --> 00:44:46,327
 I won't feel a thing will I?
 - No.

491
00:44:47,247 --> 00:44:49,766
 There'll be no pain?
 ...What's that?

492
00:44:49,767 --> 00:44:52,767
 It's just a cover to go
 over the tooth. Open up.

493
00:44:57,967 --> 00:45:00,967
 Keep still...
 There.

494
00:45:21,607 --> 00:45:24,607
 - What are you doing?!

495
00:45:27,527 --> 00:45:29,726
 There is blood everywhere?!

496
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,566
 What happened?
 - Did you cut my tongue?

497
00:45:32,567 --> 00:45:34,006
 My god!

498
00:45:34,007 --> 00:45:37,007
 This is like a slaughterhouse!
 Are you spastic or something?

499
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:39,446
 Let me take a look.
 - What is this place?!

500
00:45:39,447 --> 00:45:42,447
 She cut off my tongue!
 - No, of course not.

501
00:46:19,327 --> 00:46:22,327
 What happened?
 - I'm so sorry.

502
00:46:22,807 --> 00:46:24,646
 Can I go?

503
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:27,286
 Can I go?
 - Did I upset you?

504
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:29,366
 May I leave?
 - Of course.

505
00:46:29,367 --> 00:46:32,367
 Are you okay?
 - I'm so sorry.

506
00:47:01,847 --> 00:47:04,486
 Hello.

507
00:47:04,487 --> 00:47:07,487
 Katrin!
 - Hi.

508
00:47:11,087 --> 00:47:14,087
 I had to come...
 - Yes.

509
00:47:14,647 --> 00:47:17,647
 I've longed to see you.
 - Yes, me too.

510
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:22,006
 You look really good.
 Why haven't you...

511
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:25,007
 Why haven't you told
 your mother about us?

512
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:28,126
 I'll just leave
 you two alone.

513
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:31,127
 Thanks mom.

514
00:47:33,287 --> 00:47:36,287
 Johan,
 you can't be here.

515
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:40,087
 You can't come here!
 - But I was so worried.

516
00:47:40,687 --> 00:47:43,687
 Yes, but you have to leave.
 - What's this?

517
00:47:44,647 --> 00:47:47,647
 Johan,
 you have to leave.

518
00:47:48,287 --> 00:47:51,287
 Please do that, for me.
 I have to speak to my mom.

519
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:53,006
 I was so worried...
 Are you angry with me?

520
00:47:53,007 --> 00:47:54,846
 No, I'm not angry.
 I promise...

521
00:47:54,847 --> 00:47:56,966
 Have I done wrong?
 - No...No.

522
00:47:56,967 --> 00:47:59,286
 Sure?
 - Yes, but you have to leave.

523
00:47:59,287 --> 00:48:01,166
 I brought you something.
 - What?

524
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:03,566
 No, Johan...

525
00:48:03,567 --> 00:48:06,567
 We can catch up later...
 Johan?

526
00:48:06,807 --> 00:48:09,807
 Can we meet later tonight?
 - See here, see.

527
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:16,726
 Try it on.
 - I don't want to!

528
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,727
 Try it.
 - But...

529
00:48:20,527 --> 00:48:23,527
 Do you like it?
 - Yes.

530
00:48:23,607 --> 00:48:26,607
 Listen...
 Can we talk later?

531
00:48:27,967 --> 00:48:30,967
 Shall I go?
 - Please.

532
00:48:34,407 --> 00:48:36,526
 We'll talk tonight.

533
00:48:36,527 --> 00:48:39,527
 I can't right now.

534
00:48:41,567 --> 00:48:44,567
 Tonight.

535
00:48:45,287 --> 00:48:48,287
 I understand.
 - Thank you.

536
00:48:49,287 --> 00:48:52,287
 I'm very grateful.

537
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:31,367
 Hello?

538
00:49:33,767 --> 00:49:35,606
 What's wrong?

539
00:49:35,607 --> 00:49:37,406
 You're late.

540
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:39,966
 Late?

541
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:42,967
 You promised to
 pick me up from school.

542
00:49:44,127 --> 00:49:47,127
 Dad?

543
00:49:48,207 --> 00:49:50,646
 Don't you know me?

544
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:53,647
 It's me, Oskar.
 Your son.

545
00:49:56,687 --> 00:49:59,687
 Yes...

546
00:50:04,247 --> 00:50:06,846
 Dad?
 - Yes?

547
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:09,847
 Should we go for a walk?
 Get some fresh air.

548
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:15,487
 Where are your shoes?
 - Somewhere around.

549
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:24,607
 I...

550
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:27,847
 I just don't know
 what to do...

551
00:50:28,607 --> 00:50:31,607
 Dad?

552
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:35,767
 It was never this way
 with you and mom, was it?

553
00:50:38,927 --> 00:50:41,927
 There are so
 many things...

554
00:50:44,087 --> 00:50:47,087
 Our heavenly father's
 gentle hand.

555
00:50:48,527 --> 00:50:51,527
 Shall lead us through
 this troubled land.

556
00:50:52,687 --> 00:50:55,686
 He comforts those
 whose hearts are sad.

557
00:50:55,687 --> 00:50:58,687
 Tormented souls.
 Good or bad.

558
00:50:59,727 --> 00:51:02,727
 O father though
 you do as you please

559
00:51:02,967 --> 00:51:05,967
 We pray you will
 our troubles ease

560
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:10,367
 and give our souls...

561
00:51:10,407 --> 00:51:13,407
 your heavenly peace.

562
00:51:32,207 --> 00:51:35,207
 Baldur!

563
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:41,766
 Hi!

564
00:51:41,767 --> 00:51:43,686
 Where's grandma?

565
00:51:43,687 --> 00:51:46,126
 Grandma is a bit busy
 so I'm here to pick you up.

566
00:51:46,127 --> 00:51:47,526
 Jump in.

567
00:51:47,527 --> 00:51:50,527
 Fun in school today?

568
00:51:53,927 --> 00:51:56,926
 What did you do?

569
00:51:56,927 --> 00:51:59,927
 This and that...

570
00:52:00,887 --> 00:52:03,646
 Why do you have
 suitcases?

571
00:52:03,647 --> 00:52:06,647
 Are you leaving?

572
00:52:08,247 --> 00:52:11,247
 Well. I...

573
00:52:11,447 --> 00:52:14,447
 I've got a
 surprise for you.

574
00:52:17,447 --> 00:52:19,246
 Do you like
 amusement parks?

575
00:52:19,247 --> 00:52:22,247
 Yes?

576
00:52:22,447 --> 00:52:25,447
 But have you been to
 the one in Copenhagen?

577
00:52:26,927 --> 00:52:29,927
 No.

578
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:32,606
 I was thinking...

579
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,886
 of inviting you.
 Today...

580
00:52:34,887 --> 00:52:37,887
 to Copenhagen!

581
00:52:40,607 --> 00:52:43,446
 Just the two of us.
 We'll have a great time

582
00:52:43,447 --> 00:52:46,246
 There are a lot of
 cool rides.

583
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:48,846
 Like the one, that- 
 - Can you stop the car?

584
00:52:48,847 --> 00:52:51,847
 Seriously, there's one
 that goes straight down- 

585
00:52:52,327 --> 00:52:54,686
 Stop the car!

586
00:52:54,687 --> 00:52:57,687
 Stop the car!
 - Let's talk about this.

587
00:52:58,247 --> 00:53:01,247
 Baldur?!

588
00:53:04,767 --> 00:53:07,606
 Baldur,
 come back!

589
00:53:07,607 --> 00:53:10,286
 Sorry!
 We don't have to...

590
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:13,287
 We don't have to go!
 Come back.

591
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:16,567
 Please!
 I'll drive you home.

592
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:46,046
 What was that procedure
 your ex made you have?

593
00:53:46,047 --> 00:53:47,326
 What do you mean?

594
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:50,327
 When you were arguing
 on the phone.

595
00:53:50,607 --> 00:53:52,326
 You said...

596
00:53:52,327 --> 00:53:55,327
 You had "your tubes tied"?
 Is it true?

597
00:53:56,087 --> 00:53:58,326
 Oskar,
 I...

598
00:53:58,327 --> 00:54:00,006
 You have to
 understand...

599
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:02,126
 I was young,
 I didn't know...

600
00:54:02,127 --> 00:54:04,606
 Why the hell
 didn't you tell me?!

601
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:06,086
 I was afraid.

602
00:54:06,087 --> 00:54:08,646
 Afraid of what? Me?
 - Oskar, listen to me!

603
00:54:08,647 --> 00:54:11,366
 Sure, I'm listening.

604
00:54:11,367 --> 00:54:13,286
 I was fearful
 that...

605
00:54:13,287 --> 00:54:14,926
 Look- 
 - Oskar, listen to me!

606
00:54:14,927 --> 00:54:17,927
 I was afraid...
 You'd leave me if you knew.

607
00:54:19,887 --> 00:54:22,887
 This is a huge breach of trust.
 Do you understand?

608
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:25,366
 You let me think
 all this time...

609
00:54:25,367 --> 00:54:28,166
 that we can have
 a child together.

610
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:31,167
 I don't like this
 at all!

611
00:54:32,807 --> 00:54:35,807
 Maybe they can
 fix it?

612
00:54:36,127 --> 00:54:39,127
 Yes!
 I'm certain of it.

613
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:42,006
 Oskar...

614
00:54:42,007 --> 00:54:44,646
 Doctors today
 can do miracles.

615
00:54:44,647 --> 00:54:46,566
 - Listen to me!

616
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:49,567
 Doctors can...
 - I can't ever have children!

617
00:54:49,727 --> 00:54:52,727
 They took away
 my ovaries.

618
00:54:54,007 --> 00:54:57,007
 - Now you know.

619
00:54:59,527 --> 00:55:02,527
 - I'm sorry.

620
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,766
 Listen honey...

621
00:55:05,767 --> 00:55:08,767
 We'll go out to dinner.
 Everything will be fine.

622
00:55:09,127 --> 00:55:11,446
 Let's just relax...

623
00:55:11,447 --> 00:55:14,447
 Forget about- 
 - What's wrong with you?

624
00:55:15,447 --> 00:55:17,686
 - Aren't you even angry?

625
00:55:17,687 --> 00:55:20,126
 I've lied to you for years
 and you're not even angry?

626
00:55:20,127 --> 00:55:21,966
 I never know where
 I've got you!

627
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:24,086
 I'm furious!
 I want to smash everything.

628
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:26,406
 I'm incredibly angry...
 and disappointed!

629
00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:28,486
 But I'm going to
 control myself.

630
00:55:28,487 --> 00:55:31,126
 I want to enjoy life,
 with you...

631
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:33,486
 We'll go out,
 together

632
00:55:33,487 --> 00:55:36,487
 and everything
 will be fine!

633
00:55:37,527 --> 00:55:40,527
 I'll see you later
 honey.

634
00:55:40,887 --> 00:55:43,887
 Bye.

635
00:55:56,847 --> 00:55:59,847
 Hi.
 How are you?

636
00:56:01,487 --> 00:56:04,487
 Oh, I'm fine.

637
00:56:08,767 --> 00:56:11,767
 Papers..?
 What papers?

638
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:21,446
 Without...
 You know...

639
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:24,447
 Without talking to me first?

640
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:29,446
 I just thought...

641
00:56:29,447 --> 00:56:31,926
 I didn't realise
 we were at that stage...

642
00:56:31,927 --> 00:56:34,927
 Signing some papers?

643
00:56:35,007 --> 00:56:37,646
 Well, you could've
 called me.

644
00:56:37,647 --> 00:56:40,647
 The phone is always on.

645
00:56:41,807 --> 00:56:43,966
 Well, I&

646
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:46,967
 I'm not coming home
 to sign any divorce papers.

647
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:51,086
 That's for damn sure!

648
00:56:51,087 --> 00:56:54,087
 I just don't
 agree with you...

649
00:56:54,687 --> 00:56:57,687
 If you want to meet with me,
 you can come over.

650
00:56:58,927 --> 00:57:01,246
 I'm staying at...

651
00:57:01,247 --> 00:57:03,846
 Hotel Iceland.

652
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:06,006
 Yes, I am!

653
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:09,007
 Yes, hang on...
 Out, get out.

654
00:57:17,527 --> 00:57:19,206
 What?

655
00:57:19,207 --> 00:57:21,486
 No,
 just someone asking...

656
00:57:21,487 --> 00:57:24,487
 I'm busy at the office
 as usual.

657
00:57:25,087 --> 00:57:28,087
 Like I said...

658
00:57:28,207 --> 00:57:31,207
 If you want to meet
 you can come over.

659
00:57:32,247 --> 00:57:35,247
 I'm still at work,

660
00:57:36,927 --> 00:57:39,927
 I have to finish up here.
 I'll be at the hotel around ten.

661
00:57:41,927 --> 00:57:44,927
 Room number 203.

662
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:40,567
 Can I offer you something?
 - No, I'm good.

663
00:59:40,727 --> 00:59:43,727
 What's this
 Cocos Parfait?

664
00:59:43,927 --> 00:59:46,927
 - Cocos Parfait?
 It's a fromage.

665
00:59:47,007 --> 00:59:50,007
 - With dried fruits,
 strawberries and blueberries.

666
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:54,687
 And this, number 25?
 - Vanilla and Chocolate souffle?

667
00:59:55,567 --> 00:59:58,567
 - It's a warm
 chocolate mousse.

668
00:59:58,727 --> 01:00:01,406
 It's French.

669
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,926
 What do you recommend?
 - Cocos Parfait.

670
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:06,166
 Is that good?
 - Yes, very good.

671
01:00:06,167 --> 01:00:08,406
 I'll have one of those.
 What about you Oskar?

672
01:00:08,407 --> 01:00:10,206
 What are you having?

673
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:13,207
 What are you- 
 - Nothing, nothing for me.

674
01:00:14,327 --> 01:00:17,327
 Yes, coffee and Cognac!
 - Any special brand?

675
01:00:18,207 --> 01:00:21,207
 Just, surprise me.
 That would be great.

676
01:00:27,807 --> 01:00:30,807
 Cheers.
 - Cheers.

677
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:34,007
 I was thinking.

678
01:00:37,127 --> 01:00:39,166
 You know...

679
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:42,167
 What we've been
 talking about.

680
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:45,807
 Know what?
 These days, women can...

681
01:00:45,847 --> 01:00:48,847
 ...get help.
 You know.

682
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:53,847
 Science has progressed
 so much that...

683
01:00:54,927 --> 01:00:57,366
 We could get
 a donor egg.

684
01:00:57,367 --> 01:01:00,166
 If we would get one...

685
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:03,167
 I could fertilize it...
 with my stuff.

686
01:01:04,207 --> 01:01:07,207
 Then you would carry it...

687
01:01:07,687 --> 01:01:10,446
 In your womb
 for nine months.

688
01:01:10,447 --> 01:01:12,286
 And it would be ours.

689
01:01:12,287 --> 01:01:15,287
 Where would you get one?
 At the supermarket?

690
01:01:15,607 --> 01:01:18,607
 No, not at the supermarket.
 I don't know...

691
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,967
 Sonja, for example,
 your daughter.

692
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:25,847
 - She could donate
 an egg.

693
01:01:32,247 --> 01:01:34,726
 Genetically speaking...

694
01:01:34,727 --> 01:01:37,727
 She's your flesh and blood.

695
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:41,646
 You can't be serious?!

696
01:01:41,647 --> 01:01:44,647
 She's sexually mature, right?
 Isn't she?

697
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:48,087
 She must be, you know,
 girls mature much sooner.

698
01:01:50,487 --> 01:01:52,326
 - So then...

699
01:01:52,327 --> 01:01:55,327
 I'd be the baby's
 mother and grandmother?

700
01:01:59,607 --> 01:02:02,486
 Yeah...
 - Realise what you are saying?

701
01:02:02,487 --> 01:02:05,487
 Yes, sorry.
 Forget I said it.

702
01:02:05,647 --> 01:02:08,647
 Sorry, I just...

703
01:02:09,087 --> 01:02:12,087
 It was just the first thing
 that came to mind.

704
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:16,686
 I'm sorry.

705
01:02:16,687 --> 01:02:19,246
 But...

706
01:02:19,247 --> 01:02:22,247
 One of your friends.
 They could give you one?

707
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:26,367
 This is crazy talk.
 You're obsessed!

708
01:02:28,207 --> 01:02:31,166
 Alright, okay...

709
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:34,167
 You just don't want
 to have my baby, that's it- 

710
01:02:56,927 --> 01:02:59,927
 Thanks...
 Thanks for coming.

711
01:03:01,327 --> 01:03:03,686
 I couldn't talk at home.

712
01:03:03,687 --> 01:03:06,687
 You have to understand,
 the situation is complicated.

713
01:03:07,167 --> 01:03:10,167
 My mother, she's so damn- 
 No, I don't want...

714
01:03:14,487 --> 01:03:16,366
 Thanks.
 - You don't want one?

715
01:03:16,367 --> 01:03:19,367
 No, thanks.

716
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:23,367
 It's like I said- 

717
01:03:25,767 --> 01:03:28,686
 I've been
 thinking things over.

718
01:03:28,687 --> 01:03:31,687
 And I understand
 how you feel.

719
01:03:32,567 --> 01:03:34,766
 I can change.

720
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:37,767
 I know I've made promises
 but this time it's for real.

721
01:03:38,287 --> 01:03:41,086
 I'll change, I swear I will.
 - Yes, but it doesn't- 

722
01:03:41,087 --> 01:03:44,087
 I promise. Things will get
 so much better.

723
01:03:45,807 --> 01:03:48,807
 No, it's- 
 - Much better.

724
01:03:49,527 --> 01:03:52,527
 Wait...

725
01:03:55,567 --> 01:03:58,567
 I love you.

726
01:03:59,527 --> 01:04:02,527
 I love you.

727
01:04:20,367 --> 01:04:22,766
 Hi.
 - Hi.

728
01:04:22,767 --> 01:04:25,767
 Come on in.

729
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:30,367
 Come in.

730
01:04:30,807 --> 01:04:33,807
 I found a bottle
 of red wine.

731
01:04:33,967 --> 01:04:36,967
 Do you want a glass?
 - No thanks, I'm driving.

732
01:04:47,447 --> 01:04:50,447
 Well, what's up?

733
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:57,127
 Have you been here
 for two months Einar?

734
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:01,607
 That sounds about right,
 two months.

735
01:05:04,527 --> 01:05:07,527
 It's a pretty long time.

736
01:05:07,807 --> 01:05:10,046
 - It's no home.

737
01:05:10,047 --> 01:05:13,047
 You've got to get
 some help, Einar.

738
01:05:14,207 --> 01:05:17,206
 Staying here
 like some fool.

739
01:05:17,207 --> 01:05:20,207
 We're all worried
 about you.

740
01:05:20,367 --> 01:05:23,367
 Maybe I'm worried
 about you.

741
01:05:27,487 --> 01:05:30,487
 Maybe you need
 to get some help?

742
01:05:34,007 --> 01:05:37,007
 No, please...

743
01:05:37,087 --> 01:05:40,087
 I admit
 I have my faults.

744
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:45,167
 But so do you.
 .

745
01:05:45,807 --> 01:05:47,926
 I am...

746
01:05:47,927 --> 01:05:50,927
 These are the papers.
 Einar, you need to sign them.

747
01:05:55,167 --> 01:05:58,167
 I'm thinking...

748
01:05:58,927 --> 01:06:01,927
 it would be best
 if I'd decide this.

749
01:06:02,607 --> 01:06:05,607
 I... I don't think this is
 something you really want

750
01:06:07,407 --> 01:06:10,407
 and that you're doing it
 out of pure stubbornness.

751
01:06:11,607 --> 01:06:14,607
 Einar, you don't function
 in a normal household.

752
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:18,247
 That's just bullshit
 and you know it.

753
01:06:21,087 --> 01:06:24,087
 Don't drag up this crap.
 Not here, not to me.

754
01:06:26,967 --> 01:06:29,967
 Are you sure you don't want
 a glass of wine? We can talk- 

755
01:06:31,767 --> 01:06:34,767
 - No thanks.

756
01:06:35,967 --> 01:06:38,967
 It would be good if you
 would give me a moment.

757
01:06:40,607 --> 01:06:43,607
 Just have a seat,
 and a glass of wine.

758
01:06:43,727 --> 01:06:46,727
 I will set you straight
 within thirty minutes.

759
01:06:49,647 --> 01:06:52,647
 Well, the papers
 are on the table...

760
01:06:53,727 --> 01:06:56,446
 I'll have someone
 fetch them for me.

761
01:06:56,447 --> 01:06:59,326
 Don't be this way.
 Halla, please stop!

762
01:06:59,327 --> 01:07:02,326
 Please don't do this!

763
01:07:02,327 --> 01:07:04,446
 Don't leave me.

764
01:07:04,447 --> 01:07:07,447
 I'm hopeless
 without you.

765
01:07:35,487 --> 01:07:38,487
 I understand you want a child.
 All women do.

766
01:07:38,927 --> 01:07:40,726
 It's the mothers's instinct.

767
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:43,727
 I don't want
 you to be sad.

768
01:07:44,367 --> 01:07:47,367
 I really don't.
 You're strong and look nice.

769
01:07:48,967 --> 01:07:51,967
 It's like you said, you can
 get any woman you want.

770
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,447
 You have money
 and a fantastic apartment- 

771
01:07:55,687 --> 01:07:58,687
 Blow me.

772
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:02,286
 Can I get you anything?
 - Sorry?

773
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:04,086
 Can I bring you
 something?

774
01:08:04,087 --> 01:08:06,006
 Sparkling water.

775
01:08:06,007 --> 01:08:09,007
 Blow me!

776
01:08:17,847 --> 01:08:20,847
 Or, should I
 ask you mother to do it?

777
01:09:53,047 --> 01:09:56,047
 Piece of shit!

778
01:10:09,687 --> 01:10:12,687
 So, Mr.Shit...

779
01:10:32,167 --> 01:10:34,326
 Champagne?

780
01:10:34,327 --> 01:10:37,046
 I think it's time
 you went to bed.

781
01:10:37,047 --> 01:10:40,047
 Why?
 Let's talk a bit.

782
01:10:44,287 --> 01:10:47,287
 I'm off to bed.
 - Erna!

783
01:10:57,967 --> 01:11:00,967
 Erna?
 Talk to me.

784
01:11:02,327 --> 01:11:05,327
 We have to
 communicate more.

785
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:08,286
 I need to
 tell you things...

786
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:11,287
 From back in the days...

787
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:14,767
 You're absolutely right!

788
01:11:26,487 --> 01:11:29,487
 - This is excellent
 Champagne!

789
01:11:35,487 --> 01:11:38,487
 - I'll drink by myself,
 then.

790
01:11:45,887 --> 01:11:48,887
 Here you go.
 Enjoy.

791
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:40,807
 Hello?
 - Hello.

792
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:44,567
 Do you have an appointment?
 - No, just looking for my mom.

793
01:14:47,327 --> 01:14:49,886
 What's her name?

794
01:14:49,887 --> 01:14:52,246
 Katrin Rose.

795
01:14:52,247 --> 01:14:55,006
 She's your mom?
 - Yes.

796
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:57,406
 I haven't seen her
 all day.

797
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:00,407
 Oh...

798
01:15:04,127 --> 01:15:06,406
 Hey champ?

799
01:15:06,407 --> 01:15:09,407
 What's your name?
 - Baldur.

800
01:15:10,967 --> 01:15:13,967
 When did you last see her?
 - Last night.

801
01:15:14,647 --> 01:15:17,647
 Last night?
 Were you up late?

802
01:15:18,207 --> 01:15:21,207
 No, I just woke up
 when she was leaving.

803
01:15:24,007 --> 01:15:27,007
 You don't know
 where she was going?

804
01:15:31,287 --> 01:15:34,166
 Maybe she went
 on a short trip?

805
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:37,167
 Well...
 She had a suitcase.

806
01:15:40,607 --> 01:15:43,607
 Do you have an uncle or
 an aunt in the countryside?

807
01:15:43,847 --> 01:15:46,086
 Yes.

808
01:15:46,087 --> 01:15:49,087
 Maybe she's visiting family?
 Could that be the case?

809
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:53,087
 Then she would have
 told me.

810
01:15:53,367 --> 01:15:56,367
 Yes. It's weird.

811
01:15:56,807 --> 01:15:59,807
 Are you feeling sad?
 - No. What's that?

812
01:16:00,487 --> 01:16:03,487
 It's a kind of a...

813
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:07,127
 ...Television.

814
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:10,367
 Shall I show you?
 Have a seat.

815
01:16:15,327 --> 01:16:18,327
 Do you go to a dentist?
 - Yes.

816
01:16:19,527 --> 01:16:22,527
 Have you seen one of these?
 - Yes.

817
01:16:23,527 --> 01:16:26,406
 Know what it is?
 - No.

818
01:16:26,407 --> 01:16:29,407
 It's a...
 Camera.

819
01:16:29,767 --> 01:16:32,767
 It takes x- rays.
 And afterwards...

820
01:16:33,447 --> 01:16:36,447
 I see the pictures
 up there.

821
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,527
 Then I can show the patients
 how their teeth look.

822
01:16:43,927 --> 01:16:46,927
 I could also
 show them movies.

823
01:16:47,607 --> 01:16:50,246
 If I had any.

824
01:16:50,247 --> 01:16:53,247
 But I don't.

825
01:16:55,967 --> 01:16:58,967
 What school do you go to?
 - Fellaschool.

826
01:17:00,047 --> 01:17:03,047
 And which school
 did you go to in Sweden?

827
01:17:04,087 --> 01:17:07,087
 I didn't go to school
 in Sweden.

828
01:17:08,047 --> 01:17:11,047
 Oh..?
 Were you just slacking?

829
01:17:12,207 --> 01:17:15,207
 No?

830
01:17:15,447 --> 01:17:18,447
 Oh, you mean,
 when mom went to Sweden?

831
01:17:20,647 --> 01:17:23,647
 I didn't go with her.
 I stayed with grandma.

832
01:17:25,167 --> 01:17:27,766
 Is that so?

833
01:17:27,767 --> 01:17:30,767
 But what about your dad?
 - I don't know.

834
01:17:33,527 --> 01:17:36,527
 I kind of don't know
 anything about him.

835
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,687
 So it goes sometimes.
