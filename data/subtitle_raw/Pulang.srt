1
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:50,042
<i>I promise to take care of your heart...</i>

2
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,833
<i>until the end of my life.</i>

3
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:56,625
<i>I want to see you adorned.</i>

4
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,875
<i>Let me go, Thom.</i>

5
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,833
<i>You and Omar are my life.</i>

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,958
<i>I will return.</i>

7
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:14,875
Ahmad!

8
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:21,292
Take it easy, Grandma.
I'm here. Easy, easy.

9
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,375
Grandma, we should go to the hospital.

10
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,667
No.

11
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,792
If I go,

12
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:56,167
I will never come back to this house.

13
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:55,833
There isn't much time.

14
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,958
I won't be here much longer.

15
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,292
Please don't say that.

16
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:05,125
I want to know, Ahmad.

17
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:09,167
Before I die,

18
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:11,917
I want to know

19
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,333
what really happened.

20
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:21,833
Listen to the story I kept
all these years,

21
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,250
from beginning to end.

22
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,292
<i>I never believed in love at first sight...</i>

23
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:10,458
<i>but it happens</i>

24
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,625
<i>when you least expect it.</i>

25
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,250
Have a look, then choose.

26
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,542
All fresh from the sea.

27
00:04:31,375 --> 00:04:32,792
All the fishes are fresh.

28
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,958
Come. Take a look at the fresh fish.

29
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,958
There's mackerel, sardines, threadfish...

30
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:38,792
-Come and take a look.
-Miss.

31
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,792
-Have a look first.
-These are fresh fishes.

32
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,125
Thom, if you want the good ones,

33
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,750
go there.

34
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,250
Come. There are lots of fresh fishes.

35
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:53,667
Somehow they always end up at Othman's.

36
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,000
You're right.

37
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:58,250
Salmah.

38
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,667
Mackerel, Man. Like always.
Give me the big ones.

39
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:07,542
-The usual right, Salmah?
-Yes, like always.

40
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,750
This is my friend, Thom.
Che Puteh's grandniece.

41
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,625
Che Puteh is unwell.
She's here to look after her.

42
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:18,458
-Salmah.
-What do you want, Karim?

43
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,750
Thank you, Man.

44
00:05:22,167 --> 00:05:23,000
What?

45
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,208
I'll have the same.

46
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:32,083
All items are RM1.

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,833
That's too much.

48
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:49,917
It's okay. Take it.

49
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:54,750
For Che Puteh.

50
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:02,292
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

51
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,375
Che Thom.

52
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,333
Are you done?

53
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:11,833
We'll take our leave now.

54
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,292
-Che Thom.
-Che Thom.

55
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,458
Your basket looks awfully heavy.

56
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,875
Fresh fish, come and choose!

57
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:44,208
Brother, that looks heavy. Be careful.
Those hips might just give out.

58
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:47,875
Salmah.

59
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,625
Taib, I'm going to get more fish.

60
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:54,917
Man.

61
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:57,375
Don't stare too long at that house.

62
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,292
What if the walls break?

63
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:33,292
To Che Thom who...

64
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,250
Dear...

65
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,083
For...

66
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,458
Othman.

67
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, God.

68
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,375
Thank you.

69
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,000
You haven't been here in a while.

70
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,167
Che Puteh hasn't been well.

71
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:52,708
I can't leave her for long.

72
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,208
Salmah is with her now.

73
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,208
Have you ever been out to the sea?

74
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,875
I'm actually afraid of the deep sea.

75
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm scared of drowning.

76
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,250
But the sea is calmer than the shore.

77
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,792
How is that possible?

78
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,917
Close your eyes.

79
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:20,125
Close them.

80
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:36,917
Imagine you're alone
in the middle of the ocean.

81
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:44,958
Look at the sky.

82
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:51,667
<i>Blue.</i>

83
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:55,875
<i>Bathed in sunlight.</i>

84
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,542
<i>As far as the eye can see.</i>

85
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,583
<i>Picture the ocean.</i>

86
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:04,792
<i>As green...</i>

87
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,667
<i>as it is deep...</i>

88
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,750
<i>with no end in sight.</i>

89
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:12,875
<i>All is quiet.</i>

90
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,625
<i>There is no other sound</i>

91
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:18,333
<i>except for your heartbeat.</i>

92
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,000
That's calm to me, Che Thom.

93
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,417
But the sea is never calm. Right, Othman?

94
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,833
Otherwise...

95
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:43,417
that boat wouldn't be like that.

96
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,542
Washed up...

97
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,042
and abandoned.

98
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:51,292
At least the boat had been to sea.

99
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:54,083
What good is a boat
if it's just anchored by the shore?

100
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:58,292
Che Puteh.

101
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,500
Oh, my God.

102
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,250
Grandma!

103
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,417
-Che Puteh. Thom.
-Grandma!

104
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:09,625
-Che Puteh. Oh, my God. I warned her.
-Grandma.

105
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,042
Grandma.

106
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,208
How did you fall? Grandma. Grandma Puteh.

107
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:16,333
<i>Grandma's death</i>

108
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:22,500
<i>left me lost and alone.</i>

109
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,750
<i>I lost a shoulder to cry on</i>
<i>and someone to love.</i>

110
00:10:32,292 --> 00:10:33,125
<i>Che Thom.</i>

111
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:36,208
How much longer will you be here?

112
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:41,708
Che Thom, don't go.

113
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:49,333
Che Thom, you don't have to leave.
Just stay here.

114
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,208
If I...

115
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:57,417
Che Thom, how long...

116
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:01,542
-When do you have to go?
-What is it, Othman?

117
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,042
When is Che Puteh leaving?

118
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,792
How much longer will you be here?

119
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:10,958
A day or two.

120
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,542
There's no reason for me to stay on.

121
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,333
I have no one to stay for.

122
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,500
Before you go...

123
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:36,917
I know that

124
00:11:37,292 --> 00:11:40,417
I have no riches

125
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:41,833
nor a family.

126
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:43,708
I am too ordinary.

127
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,708
And yet I am unashamed to dream of...

128
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,958
having you as my wife.

129
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:54,292
I will work hard.

130
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,125
I will try.

131
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,792
As long as there's strength in my body,
I'll work hard to give you--

132
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,292
You do have no shame, Othman.

133
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,125
Why would you think
I'd place riches before heart?

134
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:12,250
We are just the same.

135
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:16,000
I, too, have nothing, Othman...

136
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,292
except for a heart.

137
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,542
A heart that loves.

138
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,833
I promise...

139
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,500
I promise to take care of your heart...

140
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,625
until the end of my life.

141
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,667
<i>We married soon after.</i>

142
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:03,083
<i>I have never been as happy, Ahmad.</i>

143
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,250
<i>But two years later,</i>

144
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:09,250
<i>Japan invaded Malaya.</i>

145
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:07,458
Hurry up, keep walking!

146
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:11,542
<i>Japan soon occupied the whole country.</i>

147
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:18,375
<i>Day after day,</i>
<i>our lives became even more difficult.</i>

148
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,458
Move! Hurry up and go!

149
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:27,833
Move!

150
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,667
Move now!

151
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,542
Freedom from the British!

152
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:32,917
Hurry up.

153
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,292
<i>Friends turned to enemies.</i>

154
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,000
<i>Traitors were everywhere.</i>

155
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:45,958
Calm down, everyone. They are here
to free us from British occupation.

156
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:49,083
All the men have to help the Japanese.

157
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,750
Malays, Indians, here.

158
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:53,792
Chinese, over there. Hurry up!

159
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,375
Asia for Asians!

160
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:01,250
Japan is our ally,
and they want to help us.

161
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:05,292
Move.

162
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,500
I have to go, Thom.

163
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,542
Man. Don't go, Man. Don't go.

164
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,750
Don't worry.

165
00:15:14,417 --> 00:15:15,583
I'll find a way home.

166
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,875
No need to be afraid.

167
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,458
Just follow him.

168
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:35,917
<i>That was the first time Othman left me.</i>

169
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,583
Move! Hurry up and go!

170
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:52,125
<i>The Chinese-Japanese war that started</i>
<i>in mainland China spilled over here.</i>

171
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,625
<i>The Japanese continued their revenge</i>
<i>on the Chinese in Malaya.</i>

172
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:55,792
Thank you.

173
00:15:55,917 --> 00:15:57,667
We stop here. Exchange the control.

174
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,375
We'll move after an hour.

175
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:04,000
Everyone, listen up.
An hour from now, we move on from here.

176
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:08,292
We are going behind that mountain
to build an airport.

177
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,750
Hurry up and cook.

178
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,833
Hey.

179
00:16:11,167 --> 00:16:13,042
Say "Peace be upon you, Omar." Quick.

180
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:19,083
Peace be upon you, Omar.

181
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,667
-Peace be upon you, Omar.
-Peace be upon you, too.

182
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,958
Didn't expect to see you here.
What are the odds?

183
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:31,708
Damn Japanese.

184
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,583
<i>The Chinese were hunted</i>
<i>and murdered viciously.</i>

185
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:46,333
You've been made.

186
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,167
That man is Chinese.

187
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:49,583
Better make a run for it now.

188
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,500
Why are you telling me this?

189
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,875
It's okay. Relax.

190
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:56,167
Go deal with it and do it now.

191
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:57,792
Relax.

192
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,208
Get him! Capture him!

193
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:40,625
Find them!

194
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:05,042
I know where you are hiding.

195
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,542
There is no place to hide here.

196
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:11,125
Search there!

197
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:15,083
You will not escape.

198
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:17,917
Come out!

199
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,333
Hurry, find them.

200
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,958
They could be hiding amongst the bodies.

201
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,458
Do you understand my instructions?

202
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:34,375
This place is terrible
and smells very bad.

203
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,792
Come out!

204
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,208
Make sure the dead are really dead.

205
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,083
Hold it!

206
00:18:58,875 --> 00:18:59,708
Enough.

207
00:19:00,167 --> 00:19:02,583
They are not here. Let's go.

208
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,333
We are wasting time.

209
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,833
It's getting dark.
We'll look for them again tomorrow.

210
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,833
Let's go!

211
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,333
Hey.

212
00:19:38,917 --> 00:19:39,833
Is this big enough?

213
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:49,167
Let's stay here.
The Japanese are everywhere.

214
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,250
Does it hurt?

215
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:02,125
Let me see.

216
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:07,417
How is it?

217
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,208
We can stitch this up when we get home.

218
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:15,500
You?

219
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:16,667
Yours.

220
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,208
Oh, this? It's nothing.

221
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,417
Just like what the cowboys say
in the movies.

222
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,375
Lum Kah Weng.

223
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:33,125
Come again?

224
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,375
My name.

225
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,708
I don't look like an Omar, right?

226
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,167
The Japanese can't tell the difference.

227
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,750
What do they know?

228
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,833
Long live the Emperor!

229
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,333
That's all they know.

230
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,292
Othman.

231
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,292
Othman, I'm going to take care of you.

232
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,583
Don't worry.

233
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:05,292
I will bring you back safely to Serkam.

234
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,042
If it weren't for you,
we wouldn't be in trouble.

235
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,625
You're right.

236
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,125
In the name of God,
most gracious, most merciful.

237
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,750
Thank God everything went well, Thom.

238
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,083
Do you have a name yet?

239
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,583
We'll wait for his father to come home.

240
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:55,250
There is somebody there. Hurry.

241
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,208
Hurry.

242
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:18,250
<i>The Japanese were still around.</i>

243
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:23,333
<i>Those who managed to escape</i>
<i>hid in other villages</i>

244
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:26,000
<i>for months.</i>

245
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,042
Othman?

246
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:28,792
Man.

247
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:30,375
Man.

248
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,458
Man.

249
00:23:32,917 --> 00:23:33,750
Man.

250
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,500
God is great.

251
00:23:40,792 --> 00:23:42,167
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

252
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,458
-I'll go now.
-Thank you.

253
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:46,250
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you, too.

254
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:48,708
Man.

255
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:54,083
Peace be upon you.

256
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,625
Have you named him?

257
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:03,958
I was waiting for you.

258
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:13,417
Omar.

259
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:26,917
<i>The first time he left me,</i>

260
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:28,917
<i>he came back.</i>

261
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:31,708
He almost lost his life,

262
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,583
but he came home.

263
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:36,625
Peace be upon you.

264
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:38,875
Grandma.

265
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,750
Mom is here.

266
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:45,625
Mom.

267
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,208
Mother, what's wrong?

268
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:01,042
After the war,

269
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:06,208
we thought
our suffering would finally end.

270
00:25:06,583 --> 00:25:08,833
<i>But life was still very hard.</i>

271
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,833
<i>So much had been destroyed.</i>

272
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:13,625
<i>Othman says</i>

273
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:16,042
<i>nothing good ever comes easy.</i>

274
00:25:16,125 --> 00:25:18,875
<i>You have to chase after it.</i>

275
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:24,167
<i>That's why he goes out</i>
<i>further than anyone else.</i>

276
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:27,708
<i>He works harder than everyone else.</i>

277
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,375
-Taib!
-Thom.

278
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:31,458
Have you seen Man?

279
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,333
He was in the sea just now.

280
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,667
I asked him to come back, but he wouldn't.

281
00:25:37,083 --> 00:25:38,333
He's alone out there.

282
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:40,042
Take me out there.

283
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:42,167
We can't go now.

284
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:44,917
-I'll go after the rain stops.
-I'm coming with you.

285
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,083
-You can't.
-I'm coming with you!

286
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,292
Okay.

287
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:52,375
But not now.
I'll look for him when it clears up.

288
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:32,000
You're up early today.

289
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:36,375
Thom?

290
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,083
Didn't you go home?

291
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,792
Let's go. The weather's clear.

292
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:48,208
Don't worry, Thom.

293
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:50,500
We'll find him.

294
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:52,583
God willing, he'll be safe.

295
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:05,292
-Man! Taib, that's Othman. Man!
-Man!

296
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,583
Taib, hurry.

297
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:09,458
Man!

298
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:13,792
Careful with your hands, Thom.

299
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:18,750
Don't you do this again, Man.
Don't you ever leave me again.

300
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:21,917
Man, you sure are stubborn.

301
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:38,375
<i>That was the second time</i>
<i>Othman left me and returned to me.</i>

302
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:43,167
<i>I thought twice was enough.</i>

303
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:50,625
<i>After this,</i>
<i>our family would live in peace.</i>

304
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:08,042
<i>The wind blows</i>

305
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:12,458
<i>The branch falls on the rock...</i>

306
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,083
You're heavy, Omar.

307
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,042
One.

308
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,000
Two.

309
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:28,917
<i>Birds chirping in fright</i>

310
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:30,208
Peace be upon you.

311
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:36,083
<i>Dark cloudy sky...</i>

312
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:43,042
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you, too.

313
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,750
You're back. What took you so long?

314
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:49,667
-It's been a while.
-You're looking good now.

315
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,583
You're all grown up now.

316
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,375
They've had it good after the war.

317
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,167
Lots of ships...

318
00:29:04,958 --> 00:29:05,958
lots of work.

319
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:08,917
I'll head back now, Man.

320
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,750
-Peace be upon you.
-Who's that, Dad?

321
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:20,208
Sailors, Omar.

322
00:29:22,083 --> 00:29:23,333
What are sailors?

323
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:26,083
They work on big ships...

324
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,292
and go around the world.

325
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:30,708
The whole world?

326
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,333
That's fun.

327
00:29:35,458 --> 00:29:36,667
Thank God.

328
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,667
I'm starving.

329
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:44,333
-Thom, I'm going to see Karim.
-Can I come with you?

330
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:54,208
-Finally, I'm home.
-Did you run into any storm?

331
00:29:55,667 --> 00:29:56,792
Peace be upon you.

332
00:29:58,667 --> 00:29:59,917
Peace be upon you, too.

333
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,083
-How are you, Karim?
-What's this?

334
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,083
Kid, look here.

335
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,417
-Omar, look straight ahead.
-One, two, three.

336
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:13,292
<i>Omar didn't know what was about to happen.</i>

337
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,000
<i>But I knew.</i>

338
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,375
<i>He was leaving us both again.</i>

339
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:24,333
<i>Our memories together</i>

340
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:30,667
<i>Oh, how I missed you</i>

341
00:31:37,542 --> 00:31:40,417
<i>O, moon!</i>

342
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:45,042
<i>Where are the stars?</i>

343
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:52,250
<i>On top of...</i>

344
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,083
<i>The ficus tree</i>

345
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:01,417
<i>Come, sir</i>

346
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:06,292
<i>Come, love</i>

347
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,000
<i>Let's go</i>

348
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:17,625
<i>For a stroll</i>

349
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,375
<i>Many stars</i>

350
00:32:23,458 --> 00:32:28,000
<i>Befriending the moon</i>

351
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,250
Come.

352
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:36,917
Where to?

353
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:39,750
For a stroll.

354
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:47,083
It's a clear night.

355
00:32:48,542 --> 00:32:50,208
Many stars befriending the moon.

356
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:52,458
Come.

357
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:28,417
-Don't cry.
-Don't go, Man.

358
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:34,167
I don't want us to be poor
for the rest of our lives.

359
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:35,375
But we...

360
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:37,875
We'll make it work here.

361
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,667
I can sew a lot more. You can--

362
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,583
What else can I do, Thom?

363
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:46,458
I am of the sea, Thom.

364
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:51,833
The sea is all I know.

365
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,583
I want to see you adorned.

366
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,292
If not in diamonds...

367
00:34:11,667 --> 00:34:14,208
then in gold, even just a tiny piece.

368
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:18,167
I once promised you...

369
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,875
if you accept me as your husband...

370
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:29,042
I will strive for riches for you.

371
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:31,375
But I don't want that, Man.

372
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:34,167
We have enough.

373
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,917
Let me go, Thom.

374
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,958
You won't forget me?

375
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,375
-Never.
-Promise.

376
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,792
Promise me you'll come back to me, Man.

377
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,167
Thom, you and Omar are my life.

378
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:05,167
I will come home.

379
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:12,625
<i>Like a ship with no direction</i>

380
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:16,500
<i>Love, to be loved</i>

381
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,833
Thank you.

382
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:39,750
It's all done, Taib.

383
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:40,917
Wait!

384
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,292
Wait!

385
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:49,458
I almost missed it.

386
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:50,875
Peace be upon you, Omar.

387
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,458
-Man.
-Lum.

388
00:35:57,292 --> 00:35:58,375
Never mind.

389
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:00,000
Look at you.

390
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:05,000
I'm more used to your
"I want to go home" face.

391
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,625
Thom.

392
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,083
You're Che Thom?

393
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,458
No wonder you forced me
to bring you back to Serkam.

394
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,542
Thom, this is Lum.

395
00:36:21,792 --> 00:36:24,417
Omar. This is Omar, my son.

396
00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,125
-Omar?
-Omar.

397
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:34,417
He's handsome like me.

398
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:36,917
Hey.

399
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:40,875
-Are you working on the ships, too?
-Yes. I'll be on the Swyre.

400
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:43,250
Me too.

401
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:45,833
Swyre?

402
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,667
Good, I have a friend.

403
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:52,708
Che Thom, don't worry.
I will take good care of your husband.

404
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:54,458
If he misbehaves, I'll...

405
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,417
Hey.

406
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,667
Omar, study hard.

407
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:21,000
Take care of the chickens.

408
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,333
Take care of my boat.

409
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:24,708
I want to see them all cared for
when I come back.

410
00:37:25,083 --> 00:37:26,083
Yes, Father.

411
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:28,583
Take care of your mom.

412
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,417
Write to me, Man.

413
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:45,042
Thom, you know
I'm not good at writing letters.

414
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:46,625
Try.

415
00:38:09,583 --> 00:38:10,458
Move over.

416
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:35,792
<i>And that was the last time I saw him.</i>

417
00:38:37,042 --> 00:38:39,667
I want to know
why he never came home, Ahmad.

418
00:38:40,292 --> 00:38:43,333
Is he still alive or is he dead?

419
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,917
And if he has passed, how did he die?

420
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,875
Where is his grave?

421
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:53,625
I want you to find
where your grandfather is today.

422
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,750
I need to know...

423
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,375
before I die.

424
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:06,625
It's been many years, Grandma.

425
00:39:07,583 --> 00:39:08,958
How do I look for him?

426
00:39:10,333 --> 00:39:11,875
Where do I even start?

427
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,542
Try and ask your father.

428
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:17,208
Mother, Omar--

429
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:19,125
Jaybah, I know.

430
00:39:20,375 --> 00:39:21,250
Grandma.

431
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:22,875
Even if I start looking,

432
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:25,917
-I don't think I can get any answers.
-Try, Ahmad.

433
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,875
-Peace be upon you, Dad.
-Peace be upon you, too.

434
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:57,167
You just arrived, Ahmad?

435
00:39:57,417 --> 00:39:59,625
-Yes, Dad.
-Have you eaten?

436
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:00,708
Yes, I have.

437
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,083
Dad.

438
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,292
Can I ask you something?

439
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,833
I want to ask about Grandad.

440
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:32,500
<i>The wind blows</i>

441
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:37,500
<i>The branch falls on the rock</i>

442
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:38,417
<i>Dad.</i>

443
00:40:39,917 --> 00:40:40,833
Dad?

444
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:43,333
You just arrived, Ahmad.

445
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:44,917
Have you eaten?

446
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:50,292
Yes.

447
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:15,750
Those are mine.

448
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,917
Can I have a look?

449
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:49,417
This was when your mom and I
went on our very first date.

450
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,542
What about this one?

451
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:04,500
This was when I was doing my masters
in London.

452
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:07,292
I received a scholarship that time.

453
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,458
This one? What map is this?

454
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:16,708
My father's map.

455
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,083
TO OMAR

456
00:42:35,833 --> 00:42:37,542
Dad. This...

457
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,208
You just arrived, Ahmad?

458
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,708
Have you eaten?

459
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:09,667
THOM & OMAR, LAMA ROAD,
SERKAM VILLAGE, MALACCA, MALAYSIA

460
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:53,125
Unload quickly! Don't be lazy!

461
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:57,208
<i>After leaving Serkam,</i>
<i>Father boarded a ship from Singapore.</i>

462
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:02,125
<i>He was the only Malay</i>
<i>amongst other seasoned sailors.</i>

463
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:04,292
<i>The work was hard.</i>

464
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:09,542
<i>But he never felt it. All that mattered</i>
<i>was a better life for his family.</i>

465
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,792
Don't be lazy! Hurry up!

466
00:44:11,875 --> 00:44:12,708
Move faster!

467
00:44:40,208 --> 00:44:42,708
Working again? What is he doing?

468
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,042
-Strong wind, heavy rain.
-Again?

469
00:45:04,250 --> 00:45:06,208
Eat pork. You'll be fine.

470
00:45:07,542 --> 00:45:08,708
Are you an idiot?

471
00:45:08,833 --> 00:45:10,333
He's Muslim. He doesn't eat pork.

472
00:45:10,917 --> 00:45:12,958
Actually, I don't know what they eat.

473
00:45:13,458 --> 00:45:15,542
Maybe he eats the wind.
That's why he's always outside.

474
00:45:16,792 --> 00:45:17,708
Right.

475
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:20,333
He doesn't eat much,
but he's still stronger than you both.

476
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:21,958
What did you say?

477
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,250
Well?

478
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:26,750
Don't you understand?

479
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:29,625
Lum.

480
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:31,625
Hey.

481
00:45:31,833 --> 00:45:33,042
Go do your work.

482
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:43,667
Let's go.

483
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,333
What's the point of fighting them?

484
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,667
They piss me off.

485
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,875
If I don't care, why should you?

486
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:01,667
You picked up Chinese real fast.

487
00:46:03,208 --> 00:46:04,083
It's all right.

488
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:08,000
Give me your "best in the world"
cabbage soup.

489
00:46:11,958 --> 00:46:13,208
It's so delicious

490
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,292
it makes ducks mate out of season.

491
00:46:15,958 --> 00:46:16,875
Give me a taste.

492
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:18,958
I want to know if that's true.

493
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:28,458
<i>This brother of mine</i>

494
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:33,167
<i>Sails around the world</i>

495
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:37,167
<i>He is missing his wife</i>

496
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:39,833
<i>And he is miserable</i>

497
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:46,083
-Mail!
-Thank you.

498
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:50,583
Mail!

499
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:55,000
Mail!

500
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:01,375
-Have you done all the work I gave you?
-Yes, teacher.

501
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:02,667
Good.

502
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:05,125
Go to your mother.

503
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,542
Mother, did the postman come?

504
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:13,333
Are you hungry?

505
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,667
Tomorrow, maybe.

506
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:25,500
Maybe tomorrow Dad's letter will arrive.

507
00:47:27,083 --> 00:47:30,583
I'll come home early from school.
I want to wait for the postman.

508
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:48,625
Mom, you have to try

509
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:51,625
so when Dad's letter comes,
you can read it.

510
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,333
Peace be upon you.

511
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:55,958
-Peace be upon you, too.
-Omar.

512
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,208
Your book, Omar.

513
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,250
You left it at school.

514
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,000
Thank you, teacher.

515
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:08,250
-I'll make a move then.
-Thank you.

516
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,500
If Omar

517
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:14,083
or whoever needs me to teach...

518
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:17,708
I mean, it's good to learn.
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

519
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:19,875
Mail!

520
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:25,583
Postman, wait!

521
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:28,208
Mail! Wait!

522
00:48:32,583 --> 00:48:33,417
Anything else?

523
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:34,958
No.

524
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,708
Mom, look at this.

525
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:43,917
"With love and affection
from Othman Haji Alias."

526
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:47,625
Didn't I tell you it would arrive today?
Didn't I?

527
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:03,833
What are you doing?

528
00:49:03,917 --> 00:49:05,917
This is not the first time
you're stealing food!

529
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:08,708
You call this stealing?

530
00:49:09,542 --> 00:49:12,208
I took so little. It wasn't so much.

531
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:16,708
If I don't take it, it will rot,
and you throw it out anyway.

532
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:18,500
Nobody gets special privileges here.

533
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:19,958
Including you!

534
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,000
-Chef.
-Don't get involved.

535
00:49:23,625 --> 00:49:24,458
Just hold on.

536
00:49:25,292 --> 00:49:26,250
It's not his fault.

537
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:27,792
It's my fault.

538
00:49:28,708 --> 00:49:30,208
This is both your faults.

539
00:49:32,583 --> 00:49:33,875
Look what you've done.

540
00:49:34,625 --> 00:49:36,000
But it isn't your fault.

541
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,417
I can't eat the things he cooks.

542
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,208
Let me tell the captain.

543
00:49:42,292 --> 00:49:43,250
Man.

544
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:45,667
Man. Why are you being so stupid?

545
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,042
Then you'll also be fired.

546
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:48,625
I don't care, Lum.

547
00:49:48,708 --> 00:49:49,792
If you go, I go.

548
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,750
-It's not even your fault.
-Man, don't.

549
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,458
-You want to be a snitch?
-What the hell is your problem?

550
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,958
Hold him!

551
00:50:57,792 --> 00:51:00,833
Hey. Now that I won't be around,
take good care of yourself.

552
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:10,167
When will I see you again, Lum?

553
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:13,917
That, we don't know.

554
00:51:14,333 --> 00:51:16,042
But you and me, we are fated.

555
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:17,833
Just wait and see.

556
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:23,125
Japan.

557
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:21,792
I want to go home, Thom.

558
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:36,708
Lower the cargo.

559
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,708
Okay. Go there. Move a bit.

560
00:53:41,917 --> 00:53:43,167
Move a bit. Okay.

561
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:46,000
Put it down. Move a bit.

562
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,333
Okay.

563
00:53:50,167 --> 00:53:51,042
Done.

564
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,333
Hey.

565
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:24,250
Are you okay? Quick, help him.

566
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,333
It's too dangerous.

567
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:35,167
He's on fire. Hurry!

568
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,542
He's on fire! Save him, quick!

569
00:54:49,542 --> 00:54:52,000
-Hurry!
-Come here!

570
00:54:53,417 --> 00:54:55,875
-Hurry!
-Fight the fire!

571
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:07,667
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

572
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,333
Thank you.

573
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:11,333
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

574
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:14,833
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

575
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,500
<i>I'm hanging on to</i>

576
00:55:27,125 --> 00:55:31,917
<i>What's left of love</i>

577
00:55:32,542 --> 00:55:36,667
<i>That's still left</i>

578
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:41,625
<i>In your heart</i>

579
00:55:42,667 --> 00:55:44,667
<i>Even though</i>

580
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:50,792
<i>You're a world away</i>

581
00:55:51,333 --> 00:55:57,625
<i>If there's love for me</i>

582
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:02,583
<i>Get home to me</i>

583
00:56:13,625 --> 00:56:14,458
Mom!

584
00:56:16,917 --> 00:56:18,042
Mom, don't!

585
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:19,708
Even if he doesn't want to write letters,

586
00:56:19,792 --> 00:56:22,375
why doesn't he write anything
on those postcards?

587
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:23,792
Mom.

588
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,750
-Does he remember us, Omar?
-Of course he does.

589
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:30,375
He's never asked how we are,
if we are having difficulties or not.

590
00:56:30,458 --> 00:56:33,250
-He's never told us how he is!
-It's hard on a ship.

591
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:34,917
There's so much work. There's no time.

592
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:36,750
Please don't be angry.

593
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:38,208
I'm not angry!

594
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:42,792
He will write, eventually.

595
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:44,708
I know he will.

596
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:01,875
Peace be upon you.

597
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:05,792
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you, too.

598
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:10,083
This is the money I borrowed from Othman
some time ago.

599
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:12,667
Use it.

600
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:15,292
I'll take my leave.

601
00:57:15,542 --> 00:57:16,792
Thank you.

602
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:23,958
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

603
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,375
Mom?

604
00:57:26,542 --> 00:57:27,667
-Can you manage?
-Mom?

605
00:57:29,458 --> 00:57:30,958
Why is that man getting on Dad's boat?

606
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:32,917
I sold the boat.

607
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,500
Mom, Dad wouldn't let anyone else...

608
00:57:34,792 --> 00:57:35,875
Mom.

609
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:37,667
I sold the boat. It's sold!

610
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:41,125
But it's Dad's boat. He'll be upset.

611
00:57:45,583 --> 00:57:46,417
Omar.

612
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:52,292
I'm going to look for your father.

613
00:57:54,542 --> 00:57:55,750
I'll find him.

614
00:57:56,667 --> 00:57:58,083
Bring him home.

615
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:02,833
But if he comes back...

616
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:05,125
and his boat is gone, what then?

617
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:09,750
What if we keep the boat
and he never comes home?

618
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,667
He's not here.

619
00:58:13,542 --> 00:58:16,042
It's better to have Dad than his boat.

620
00:58:17,333 --> 00:58:18,667
Right, Omar?

621
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:21,208
Omar.

622
00:58:25,667 --> 00:58:26,917
Where will you look for him?

623
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:31,833
His last postcard was from Hong Kong.

624
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:33,792
And if he's not there?

625
00:58:35,083 --> 00:58:36,417
I have to try.

626
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:53,708
What is it, teacher?

627
00:58:56,833 --> 00:59:00,667
The money from the boat isn't enough
to take you to Hong Kong.

628
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,292
Please take this money.

629
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:12,708
I insist.

630
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:16,167
No, teacher.

631
00:59:17,542 --> 00:59:19,708
I'm afraid I will not be able
to pay you back.

632
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:21,750
I'm sincere.

633
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,333
You can pay me little by little,
whenever you can.

634
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:32,833
I just want to help Omar.

635
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:39,708
Teacher.

636
00:59:43,292 --> 00:59:44,292
God willing...

637
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,500
you will be abundantly rewarded.

638
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:50,750
God willing.

639
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:53,000
Keep praying for me, Che Thom.

640
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:29,417
Follow me. Don't worry.

641
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:30,875
Don't let her get away.

642
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:33,375
-Help!
-Get out of my way!

643
01:01:34,042 --> 01:01:35,792
-This way!
-Help!

644
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:37,875
Get in! Be quiet!

645
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:39,292
-Get in.
-Thom?

646
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:42,792
-Thom!
-Who's that annoying guy?

647
01:01:44,417 --> 01:01:45,417
Who are you?

648
01:01:45,958 --> 01:01:46,958
I am...

649
01:01:47,583 --> 01:01:49,167
It's me.

650
01:01:50,167 --> 01:01:52,292
You look like a nobody.

651
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:56,250
-Get him out!
-No, listen here. Listen to me.

652
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:59,583
You just plucked her off the street.
Do you know who she is?

653
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:01,333
I don't care who she is.

654
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:04,042
All I know is she is going to make me
a lot of money.

655
01:02:05,417 --> 01:02:09,208
Okay, sure, no worries.

656
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:10,333
No worries.

657
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:14,292
-Get her in.
-Lum!

658
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:16,667
Lum!

659
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,792
Okay, then why don't I tell Boss Kuan?

660
01:02:20,167 --> 01:02:22,292
You're using his people for your business.

661
01:02:22,625 --> 01:02:24,042
Let's see what Boss Kuan has to say.

662
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:24,958
Wait!

663
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:28,083
What did you say?

664
01:02:29,083 --> 01:02:30,042
Boss Kuan?

665
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:31,542
She is Kuan's property?

666
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,000
Why don't we go see Boss Kuan?

667
01:02:38,167 --> 01:02:40,125
Ah Ngau, let her go.

668
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:46,458
Come on!

669
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:48,333
Come!

670
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,750
These newcomers.

671
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:00,875
She needs to learn the rules.

672
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:03,000
Take it yourself!

673
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:05,542
-Thank you, Lum.
-Keep walking.

674
01:03:06,333 --> 01:03:08,583
What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Where's Man?

675
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:10,125
I came here to look for him.

676
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:12,958
What are you looking at? Get back to work!

677
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:15,042
You're stubborn like Othman.

678
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:20,708
Coming here alone.

679
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,708
It's dangerous.

680
01:03:23,792 --> 01:03:25,292
I had to come look for Othman.

681
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:28,083
Do you know where he is?

682
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:32,625
I wasn't with him for long on the ship.

683
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:35,333
Then I didn't see him again.

684
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:39,917
I thought it'd be easy to look for him.

685
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:42,208
I thought that when I arrived...

686
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:45,167
there would be people who know him...

687
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:47,542
know where he is.

688
01:03:48,667 --> 01:03:49,792
Like in the village.

689
01:03:51,083 --> 01:03:52,542
Things are different here.

690
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,958
Okay, I have many friends at the port.

691
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,375
Some have worked on the Swyre.

692
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:09,917
I'll go ask around.

693
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:12,542
For now, you stay here.

694
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:14,958
I'll stay with a friend.

695
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:17,917
I've troubled you, Lum.

696
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:19,958
Othman's like a brother to me.

697
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:22,792
So, we're family.

698
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,250
Does he have a mistress?

699
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:41,708
It's best if we close the windows.

700
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,125
-Did you meet Man?
-He got a promotion and a raise.

701
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:57,583
But I didn't see him after that.

702
01:05:05,583 --> 01:05:08,042
Othman has boarded the P&O ship.

703
01:05:09,708 --> 01:05:11,083
The ship is in Russia now.

704
01:05:11,625 --> 01:05:13,625
But they're not sure
when the ship will return.

705
01:05:14,542 --> 01:05:15,583
That is Yusop.

706
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:19,292
He once met Othman here.

707
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:25,625
And he said Man got a promotion
and a raise on the P&O ship.

708
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:33,750
He got a promotion and a raise...

709
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:40,000
but he can't come home.

710
01:05:52,958 --> 01:05:54,333
Lum, can you do me a favor?

711
01:05:57,417 --> 01:05:59,417
Can you pass this letter to Othman?

712
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,667
I know it's not easy.

713
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:11,208
But I don't know who else to ask, Lum.

714
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,250
I'll try.

715
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:23,208
I don't care how long it'll take.

716
01:06:27,542 --> 01:06:30,417
As long as it reaches him in person.

717
01:06:33,542 --> 01:06:35,000
I'll make sure he gets this letter.

718
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,500
Thank you, Lum.

719
01:06:50,708 --> 01:06:51,625
Xiao Bo.

720
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,917
This letter must be handed to Othman
on the P&O ship.

721
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,375
It must reach him.

722
01:06:58,458 --> 01:06:59,375
Qing.

723
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,292
Help me pass this letter to Othman.

724
01:07:34,042 --> 01:07:37,417
<i>There's an empty space</i>

725
01:07:37,875 --> 01:07:39,750
<i>Inhibited</i>

726
01:07:39,833 --> 01:07:41,333
-Mail!
-Hey.

727
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:43,958
Mail!

728
01:07:44,417 --> 01:07:45,708
Help me carry this.

729
01:07:46,667 --> 01:07:47,500
Mail!

730
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:51,083
<i>In this lonely heart of mine</i>

731
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:58,208
<i>There's no cure</i>

732
01:07:58,292 --> 01:08:02,417
<i>For this broken heart</i>

733
01:08:02,917 --> 01:08:09,917
<i>All I need is you back with me again</i>

734
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:15,917
<i>I'm hanging on</i>

735
01:08:16,458 --> 01:08:20,583
<i>To what's left of love</i>

736
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:25,083
<i>That's still left</i>

737
01:08:25,542 --> 01:08:30,375
<i>In your heart</i>

738
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:37,667
<i>Even though you're a world away...</i>

739
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:44,500
He is not coming back, Omar.

740
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:47,500
You have to accept that.

741
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:50,875
I've accepted it.

742
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:56,583
I know he'll come home.

743
01:09:01,167 --> 01:09:02,125
If he doesn't...

744
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:04,583
I'll go and find him.

745
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:16,625
Any news from Othman?

746
01:09:22,417 --> 01:09:23,875
Not even a postcard.

747
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:27,083
His letters...

748
01:09:29,542 --> 01:09:30,625
nothing at all.

749
01:09:33,792 --> 01:09:35,875
Lum hasn't sent any news either.

750
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:39,625
These sailors are all the same.

751
01:09:43,875 --> 01:09:45,333
But I'm a landlubber, Thom.

752
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:23,500
<i>The wind blows</i>

753
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:30,083
<i>The branch falls on the rock</i>

754
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:45,583
<i>He pulls the thread, and then he asks...</i>

755
01:12:46,167 --> 01:12:47,958
"Is that a mermaid?"

756
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:49,708
"No, it's a stingray!"

757
01:12:52,292 --> 01:12:54,750
Then he asks me, "Is it a male or female?"

758
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:57,792
"The stingray is pregnant!"

759
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:01,167
Pregnant, he says.

760
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:13,250
Peace be upon you, Omar.

761
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:25,042
Man.

762
01:13:26,375 --> 01:13:27,250
Lum.

763
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:30,125
-Man!
-Lum.

764
01:13:34,292 --> 01:13:35,417
Can't wait.

765
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:39,958
In the name of God,
most gracious, most merciful.

766
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:50,208
-It tastes the same, Lum.
-How did it taste?

767
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:52,792
Horrible.

768
01:14:02,417 --> 01:14:03,750
Did you go back to Malaya, Man?

769
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,500
Did you see Thom?

770
01:14:08,542 --> 01:14:11,292
After you sailed for three years,
she came to look for you in Hong Kong.

771
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:15,917
At that time,
you had just sailed to Russia.

772
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:18,333
Good thing she bumped into me.

773
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:28,458
Did she really come looking for me, Lum?

774
01:14:30,458 --> 01:14:31,625
It was dangerous for her...

775
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,208
but she's brave...

776
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,417
like you.

777
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:40,833
She said she had to look for you.

778
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:45,333
Because there was no word from you
and you didn't come home.

779
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:47,542
You didn't go home at all?

780
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:51,042
Go home.

781
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:53,708
Why are you growing old here all alone?

782
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,375
Wouldn't it be better at home?

783
01:14:59,708 --> 01:15:01,958
If I had a wife and kid,
I'd be home by now.

784
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,542
Coffee or tea, Lum?

785
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:08,542
Coffee, of course.

786
01:15:08,917 --> 01:15:10,167
Don't you know me?

787
01:15:20,542 --> 01:15:21,458
Here, take this.

788
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:24,292
-No need.
-There are better ones where I'm going.

789
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:25,292
Take it.

790
01:15:31,458 --> 01:15:32,292
Lum.

791
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:37,125
I want to thank you for always helping me.

792
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,000
-If you--
-What?

793
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:41,125
Why are you talking like this?

794
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,958
We have more of life to live.

795
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,333
I'll send you a postcard.

796
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:58,500
Hey. Hurry up.

797
01:15:58,958 --> 01:16:01,333
If I miss the ship,
I won't make it to America.

798
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,375
Take good care of yourself.

799
01:17:06,667 --> 01:17:08,417
I'm looking for Othman Haji Alias.

800
01:17:16,542 --> 01:17:17,875
Othman Haji Alias?

801
01:17:19,208 --> 01:17:21,042
Over there.

802
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:54,667
Move.

803
01:17:57,542 --> 01:17:58,375
Dad.

804
01:18:06,667 --> 01:18:07,667
Omar?

805
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:28,583
Omar, my son.

806
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:36,125
Omar, my son.

807
01:18:40,792 --> 01:18:42,583
Omar, my son.

808
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,583
How did you find me, Omar?

809
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:56,750
Uncle Lum sent a letter...

810
01:18:57,958 --> 01:18:58,917
with your address.

811
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:05,625
Sit down.

812
01:19:06,958 --> 01:19:07,917
Have a drink first.

813
01:19:24,167 --> 01:19:25,917
I don't have much, Omar.

814
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:35,208
Sailed for years...

815
01:19:38,833 --> 01:19:40,125
but nothing to show for.

816
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:44,250
Dad, our house in the village
is still there.

817
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:48,125
Your boat, though, Mom sold it.

818
01:19:48,208 --> 01:19:49,833
That's fine.

819
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,125
That's your mom's property, not mine.

820
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:58,708
Don't you want to go home?

821
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,875
There's no place
for me there anymore, Omar.

822
01:20:12,375 --> 01:20:13,708
Don't you want to see Mom?

823
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:27,292
Don't you feel sorry for Mom?

824
01:20:31,667 --> 01:20:32,750
Why don't you come home?

825
01:20:49,917 --> 01:20:51,875
The chicken coop
at the back of the house...

826
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:54,583
it's bigger now.

827
01:20:55,667 --> 01:20:58,083
Do you remember when the chicken escaped?

828
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:01,375
We chased it around the house.

829
01:21:02,458 --> 01:21:04,292
We chased it until it came into our house.

830
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:08,667
You still remember that, Omar?

831
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:12,042
I do, Dad.

832
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:15,750
A few days after that...

833
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:20,500
you went to Singapore.

834
01:21:30,042 --> 01:21:31,667
And then you never returned.

835
01:21:38,417 --> 01:21:42,375
Do you know Mom's still waiting for you
after all these years?

836
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:51,042
Do you know why I never went back?

837
01:21:57,083 --> 01:21:58,292
I wanted to go home...

838
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:03,333
<i>but I am not the master of my fate.</i>

839
01:23:14,042 --> 01:23:14,875
My money.

840
01:27:01,167 --> 01:27:02,000
How is he?

841
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:09,792
Man?

842
01:27:10,708 --> 01:27:12,208
Oh, my God, Othman!

843
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:23,125
Where is this ship going, Karim?

844
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:24,917
To Manila.

845
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:27,167
Then Goa,

846
01:27:27,708 --> 01:27:30,042
Cape Town, and straight back to London.

847
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:36,750
Will it pass by Singapore?

848
01:27:38,583 --> 01:27:39,750
You're thinking of going home?

849
01:27:43,875 --> 01:27:46,125
But how can I go home like this?

850
01:27:49,167 --> 01:27:50,667
With just clothes on my back.

851
01:27:56,917 --> 01:27:58,458
I'd be embarrassed to face everyone.

852
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,833
Especially Thom.

853
01:28:04,208 --> 01:28:06,000
What are you talking about?

854
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:11,083
Your ship sank. How is that your fault?

855
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,000
And I happen to know your wife.

856
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:18,458
Do you really think she cares
if you return with money?

857
01:28:19,292 --> 01:28:20,792
As long as you're safe.

858
01:28:23,167 --> 01:28:25,208
All she wants to know
is that you're safe, Man.

859
01:29:15,292 --> 01:29:16,958
<i>After listening to Dad's story...</i>

860
01:29:19,708 --> 01:29:21,667
<i>I understood him better.</i>

861
01:29:24,875 --> 01:29:27,958
<i>Though I know</i>
<i>he was still keeping something inside.</i>

862
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:32,542
<i>Regardless...</i>

863
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,042
<i>I still want him to go home to Mom.</i>

864
01:30:17,083 --> 01:30:17,917
Dad?

865
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:19,792
Yes, Omar.

866
01:30:20,625 --> 01:30:22,208
I'd better head back to London.

867
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:25,917
I'll come back, okay?

868
01:30:29,875 --> 01:30:30,708
Okay.

869
01:30:34,125 --> 01:30:35,750
I won't be staying in London long.

870
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:41,292
After I complete my studies...

871
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:44,083
if you want to go home...

872
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:46,708
we can go back together.

873
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:49,542
Sure.

874
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:52,458
I'll be back.

875
01:30:56,625 --> 01:30:57,458
Yes.

876
01:30:58,708 --> 01:30:59,792
Christmas break.

877
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:03,333
Yes.

878
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:06,250
We'll eat together, okay?

879
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:10,542
Yes.

880
01:31:12,708 --> 01:31:13,792
I'll call you.

881
01:31:17,708 --> 01:31:19,000
In the evening.

882
01:31:20,125 --> 01:31:21,375
I work during the day.

883
01:31:42,542 --> 01:31:45,333
Does your mom know I'm here?

884
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:47,958
No.

885
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,083
Okay.

886
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,833
I'll take my leave now.

887
01:31:55,125 --> 01:31:55,958
Okay.

888
01:31:58,792 --> 01:32:01,708
-Peace be upon you.
-Peace be upon you, too.

889
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:12,542
Yeah.

890
01:32:49,708 --> 01:32:51,792
Peace be upon you, Mom. How's Grandma?

891
01:32:55,583 --> 01:32:57,125
I've just arrived.

892
01:32:57,667 --> 01:32:59,625
I'll call later if there's anything.

893
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:01,875
Okay, peace be upon you.

894
01:33:17,208 --> 01:33:18,208
Omar.

895
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:23,542
I've missed you.

896
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:29,875
I've missed you, too, Mom.

897
01:33:31,917 --> 01:33:33,875
Dad told me to look after the boat...

898
01:33:35,167 --> 01:33:36,458
but you sold it.

899
01:33:39,208 --> 01:33:41,042
Because you needed to go to Hong Kong.

900
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:46,583
You'll be back soon.

901
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:01,958
Mom?

902
01:34:03,083 --> 01:34:05,667
Mom? Mom? Mom.

903
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:08,000
Wait for Ahmad, okay? I'll call him.

904
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:09,250
You can speak to...

905
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:11,125
Omar is here, Mom. He's right here.

906
01:34:13,875 --> 01:34:15,500
Who is it you're looking for?

907
01:34:16,042 --> 01:34:17,750
Which friend of mine?

908
01:34:19,208 --> 01:34:22,208
I was wondering if you knew my granddad?

909
01:34:23,208 --> 01:34:24,708
Othman Haji Alias?

910
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,792
He was from Serkam. He stayed at...

911
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:34,750
Othman Serkam? Sure.

912
01:34:35,417 --> 01:34:40,208
Of course I know him. We were best mates.

913
01:34:40,375 --> 01:34:43,375
We used to be at the club all the time...

914
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:45,875
those days.

915
01:34:46,417 --> 01:34:47,875
Do you know where he is now?

916
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:55,208
Othman's dead.

917
01:34:56,208 --> 01:34:59,500
We belong to God,
and to him we shall return.

918
01:35:07,167 --> 01:35:08,542
Was it a long time ago, Uncle?

919
01:35:10,042 --> 01:35:11,083
A long time ago.

920
01:35:14,583 --> 01:35:16,625
I don't remember what year it was.

921
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:22,000
At that time, his son was here.

922
01:35:23,708 --> 01:35:29,292
<i>All of us buried Othman together.</i>

923
01:35:45,458 --> 01:35:47,667
That hat belonged to his best friend.
His name was Lum.

924
01:35:49,833 --> 01:35:53,208
Othman always got a good laugh
from telling stories about Lum.

925
01:36:54,667 --> 01:36:56,167
Do you know where he was buried?

926
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:05,792
Granddad, are you all right?

927
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,042
Would you like some water?

928
01:37:17,792 --> 01:37:18,833
Alia.

929
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:24,500
How did you know about Granddad?

930
01:37:40,625 --> 01:37:41,958
-Peace be upon you, Mom.
<i>-Ahmad.</i>

931
01:37:42,042 --> 01:37:43,083
How's Grandma?

932
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:46,042
We're running out of time. She's dying.

933
01:37:52,708 --> 01:37:53,958
Grandma's dying.

934
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,542
Now...

935
01:37:58,458 --> 01:38:00,708
Grandma said if he's dead,
look for his grave.

936
01:38:13,333 --> 01:38:14,667
They might keep records.

937
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:20,375
There was this one professor

938
01:38:20,458 --> 01:38:24,875
who did research on Malay sailors
in Liverpool a while ago.

939
01:38:30,625 --> 01:38:31,667
Professor Bunnell.

940
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:43,125
Everton!

941
01:38:43,542 --> 01:38:48,417
Tim says that Muslims are buried
at Everton Cemetery.

942
01:39:22,292 --> 01:39:24,833
Tim says the Muslim cemetery
is at Everton.

943
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:29,417
But before 1970,
it was at Anfield Cemetery.

944
01:39:38,167 --> 01:39:39,500
How are we going to find him?

945
01:39:41,042 --> 01:39:42,833
Tim told us to go
to the registry office first.

946
01:40:15,625 --> 01:40:17,292
Why didn't your grandpa go home?

947
01:40:17,625 --> 01:40:20,125
He must've saved enough money
after the shipwreck.

948
01:40:20,375 --> 01:40:22,708
If not a lot, at least enough to go home.

949
01:40:22,792 --> 01:40:24,458
Why did he settle down in Liverpool

950
01:40:24,542 --> 01:40:25,917
-and not--
-Alia, can you listen?

951
01:40:52,333 --> 01:40:54,250
"Othman Haji Alias."

952
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:23,875
"Khan."

953
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:27,167
"Shihaniz."

954
01:41:27,542 --> 01:41:29,458
-"Harith Sulaiman."
-"Shirajudin."

955
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:31,917
"Othman...

956
01:41:33,208 --> 01:41:34,292
Bin Haji Alias."

957
01:41:58,958 --> 01:41:59,875
Grandma.

958
01:42:01,375 --> 01:42:02,792
I found it, Grandma.

959
01:42:19,083 --> 01:42:21,167
I seek refuge in God
from the accursed Satan.

960
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:23,667
In the name of God,
most gracious, most merciful.

961
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:29,750
Oh, God, forgive him.
Bestow mercy upon him. Pardon him.

962
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:28,208
Grandma.

963
01:43:29,583 --> 01:43:30,542
It's me.

964
01:43:32,208 --> 01:43:33,542
I'm back.

965
01:43:34,083 --> 01:43:35,667
I found him, Grandma.

966
01:43:39,375 --> 01:43:40,750
He's passed away.

967
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:50,292
We belong to God.

968
01:43:58,125 --> 01:43:59,333
This is his grave.

969
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:01,625
In Liverpool.

970
01:44:03,583 --> 01:44:05,000
Othman Bin Haji Alias.

971
01:44:05,958 --> 01:44:08,833
He died in December 1966, Grandma.

972
01:44:13,875 --> 01:44:15,958
He died before me.

973
01:44:17,458 --> 01:44:19,833
How did he die, Ahmad?

974
01:44:20,417 --> 01:44:21,750
Was he loved?

975
01:44:22,458 --> 01:44:24,542
Did he have family there?

976
01:44:27,333 --> 01:44:28,167
No, Grandma.

977
01:44:29,167 --> 01:44:30,208
But...

978
01:44:31,208 --> 01:44:32,875
Dad was there when he died.

979
01:44:35,667 --> 01:44:37,333
Dad buried him.

980
01:44:37,792 --> 01:44:43,417
All this time,
Omar knew his father had died.

981
01:44:43,917 --> 01:44:45,167
I don't know.

982
01:44:45,667 --> 01:44:47,250
I don't know, Mom.

983
01:44:51,333 --> 01:44:53,292
Did Dad ever give a letter to you?

984
01:44:54,792 --> 01:44:55,792
From Grandpa?

985
01:45:04,792 --> 01:45:06,417
Mom, please read Dad's letter.

986
01:45:08,833 --> 01:45:10,708
It's too late, Omar.

987
01:45:13,167 --> 01:45:15,417
This letter is meaningless.

988
01:45:19,875 --> 01:45:20,750
Mom.

989
01:45:22,167 --> 01:45:23,542
Don't you want to know about him?

990
01:45:25,750 --> 01:45:27,667
Did he ever ask about us, Omar?

991
01:45:29,292 --> 01:45:30,167
Ever?

992
01:45:31,875 --> 01:45:33,833
Eighteen years, Omar.

993
01:45:35,542 --> 01:45:38,750
It has always just been you and me.

994
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:41,042
He's not here.

995
01:45:41,542 --> 01:45:44,208
Now, he sends a letter. For what?

996
01:45:44,708 --> 01:45:46,042
To come back to us?

997
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:49,375
To come back to us?

998
01:45:49,833 --> 01:45:50,750
Mom!

999
01:45:54,167 --> 01:45:55,000
Mom?

1000
01:45:55,833 --> 01:45:56,958
Mom, what are you doing?

1001
01:45:57,042 --> 01:45:58,500
-Calm down, Mom.
-Move, Omar!

1002
01:45:58,583 --> 01:45:59,500
Mom.

1003
01:46:03,958 --> 01:46:06,125
Mom. Calm down, Mom.

1004
01:46:07,708 --> 01:46:08,708
Move aside, Omar!

1005
01:46:09,458 --> 01:46:10,833
Don't disobey me!

1006
01:46:11,208 --> 01:46:12,125
This is all your fault!

1007
01:46:13,917 --> 01:46:15,042
Because of you...

1008
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:17,958
I waited for him.

1009
01:46:20,125 --> 01:46:21,917
Don't you ever mention his name again.

1010
01:46:41,208 --> 01:46:42,083
Dad.

1011
01:46:44,333 --> 01:46:45,875
Where is Grandpa's letter, Dad?

1012
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,917
Push!

1013
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,542
-Push more!
-Pull!

1014
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:36,750
<i>I'm sorry, Mom.</i>

1015
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,542
I don't listen to you.

1016
01:47:40,792 --> 01:47:43,000
I didn't throw away Dad's letter.

1017
01:47:47,083 --> 01:47:48,500
I kept it all this time.

1018
01:48:20,958 --> 01:48:21,917
Mom.

1019
01:48:25,667 --> 01:48:27,208
You want me to read it, Grandma?

1020
01:48:36,958 --> 01:48:37,792
-"Thom..."
<i>-Thom...</i>

1021
01:48:39,625 --> 01:48:42,333
<i>when this letter reaches you...</i>

1022
01:48:45,208 --> 01:48:47,292
<i>I am no longer in this world.</i>

1023
01:48:54,708 --> 01:48:59,542
<i>But... I never forgot my promise.</i>

1024
01:49:09,333 --> 01:49:10,375
Man!

1025
01:49:11,792 --> 01:49:12,792
What are you doing, Man?

1026
01:49:13,625 --> 01:49:14,750
Othman!

1027
01:49:16,333 --> 01:49:17,292
Hey!

1028
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:18,333
Stop!

1029
01:49:18,667 --> 01:49:20,625
Stop! Wait!

1030
01:49:21,292 --> 01:49:22,208
Othman!

1031
01:49:22,667 --> 01:49:23,708
Stop!

1032
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,792
Wait! Come!

1033
01:50:08,792 --> 01:50:09,875
Let it go, Taib.

1034
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:12,042
Don't sulk.

1035
01:50:13,125 --> 01:50:14,292
It's a good thing.

1036
01:50:14,375 --> 01:50:16,167
I just feel sorry for Othman.

1037
01:50:16,833 --> 01:50:17,750
What if he comes back?

1038
01:50:18,125 --> 01:50:19,000
What about Thom?

1039
01:50:19,792 --> 01:50:20,625
And Omar?

1040
01:50:21,042 --> 01:50:21,875
You don't feel sorry?

1041
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:24,000
Teacher Hassan is a nice man.

1042
01:50:24,208 --> 01:50:25,042
He is well-to-do.

1043
01:50:25,417 --> 01:50:27,208
Thom's and Omar's future
will be taken care of.

1044
01:50:27,958 --> 01:50:28,917
God willing, Taib.

1045
01:50:38,333 --> 01:50:39,292
Thom.

1046
01:51:03,458 --> 01:51:04,917
<i>I want to see you adorned...</i>

1047
01:51:06,833 --> 01:51:10,708
<i>if not in diamonds, then in gold...</i>

1048
01:51:11,292 --> 01:51:12,875
<i>even just a tiny piece.</i>

1049
01:51:44,625 --> 01:51:46,000
<i>But you never remarried.</i>

1050
01:51:46,375 --> 01:51:49,000
<i>I wanted to move on with my life...</i>

1051
01:51:50,833 --> 01:51:55,167
<i>but my heart was set.</i>

1052
01:51:59,458 --> 01:52:03,167
<i>It only wanted him.</i>

1053
01:52:05,042 --> 01:52:06,042
I'm sorry. I can't.

1054
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:17,833
He probably came home to Serkam
that night.

1055
01:52:22,167 --> 01:52:25,208
He came home, Ahmad.

1056
01:52:32,583 --> 01:52:36,375
Dad came home, Omar.

1057
01:52:39,417 --> 01:52:40,958
<i>Forgive me, Thom.</i>

1058
01:52:41,958 --> 01:52:44,875
<i>For thinking that you could be happier...</i>

1059
01:52:46,542 --> 01:52:48,333
<i>with someone wealthy...</i>

1060
01:52:50,583 --> 01:52:52,250
<i>rather than someone you loved.</i>

1061
01:52:55,208 --> 01:52:59,625
<i>Forgive me for not trusting your words.</i>

1062
01:53:01,125 --> 01:53:05,792
<i>Forgive me for keeping us apart</i>
<i>all these years.</i>

1063
01:53:07,583 --> 01:53:09,292
<i>I used to think...</i>

1064
01:53:10,042 --> 01:53:13,333
<i>a ship that doesn't sail is useless.</i>

1065
01:53:15,125 --> 01:53:16,583
<i>But now I know, Thom...</i>

1066
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:22,875
<i>a ship permanently at sea,</i>
<i>without a harbor to come home to,</i>

1067
01:53:23,667 --> 01:53:26,042
<i>that is truly a wasted life.</i>

1068
01:53:27,792 --> 01:53:30,083
<i>I have never forgotten you, Thom.</i>

1069
01:53:31,042 --> 01:53:32,958
<i>I still love you...</i>

1070
01:53:34,583 --> 01:53:35,833
<i>to this very day.</i>

1071
01:53:43,917 --> 01:53:46,292
We belong to God,
and to him we shall return.

1072
01:53:46,375 --> 01:53:48,708
We belong to God,
and to him we shall return.

1073
01:54:00,333 --> 01:54:03,833
<i>If we don't get to meet again</i>
<i>in this life...</i>

1074
01:54:06,083 --> 01:54:08,500
<i>may he reunite us...</i>

1075
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:12,125
<i>in the hereafter.</i>

1076
01:54:13,833 --> 01:54:17,500
<i>There is an empty space</i>

1077
01:54:17,625 --> 01:54:20,083
<i>Inhibited</i>

1078
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:30,292
<i>In this lonely heart of mine</i>

1079
01:54:33,625 --> 01:54:37,708
<i>There's no cure</i>

1080
01:54:37,792 --> 01:54:42,167
<i>For this broken heart</i>

1081
01:54:42,708 --> 01:54:45,792
<i>All I need is you</i>

1082
01:54:45,875 --> 01:54:49,667
<i>Back with me again</i>
