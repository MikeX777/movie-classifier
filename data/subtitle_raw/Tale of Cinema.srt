00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:46,039
Thank you. Thank you. 
Screenplay & Direction 
HONG Sangsoo

3
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,512
It's a wise choice.

4
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,204
And It's cheaper here.

5
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:59,580
It's good to get back to the guitar. 
You played bass, didn't you?

6
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:02,586
It's beautiful.

7
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,893
Your exams are over. 
Let's go walking in the mountains.

8
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:12,191
Walking? 
I don't know.

9
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,392
Keep me posted.

10
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,604
That's typical!

11
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,308
Just say you don't want to come.

12
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,205
Instead of dodging the issue.

13
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:27,808
It's not that.

14
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,278
Let's go then. 
Is walking fun?

15
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,685
Forget it. We'll see.

16
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,084
It's not like before.

17
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:43,594
You see too many unemployed people, 
It's not nice.

18
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,288
Which way are you going?

19
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,200
That way.

20
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,301
OK.

21
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,307
- It's too much. 
- Take it.

22
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,476
You're having a tough year.

23
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,282
See you at mom's on Sunday.

24
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,287
Thanks, big brother.

25
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,394
Take care.

26
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,499
I made a detour 
to avoid going with my brother..

27
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,714
He had given me 200,000 wons.

28
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,781
For once, I was planning

29
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,477
to spend it all.

30
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,810
Do you work here?

31
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:10,177
Yes, It's my uncle's shop.

32
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:13,075
How long has it been?

33
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,788
It's been two years, hasn't it?

34
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:23,187
I'm so happy to see you!

35
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,898
You don't go to school anymore?

36
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:34,296
No. 
I'll study again later.

37
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,908
You haven't changed. 
Still good-looking.

38
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,277
I have to go back in.

39
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,285
Go on then.

40
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:56,089
What about you? 
What are you doing?

41
00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:00,188
What if I invited you 
to a smart restaurant?

42
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,596
To celebrate our reunion.

43
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:07,297
You're serious? I finish at seven. 
Does that suit you?

44
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,501
You'll come back? 
You can?

45
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:19,878
Sure. 
You work that late?

46
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,881
I'm paid to.

47
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,806
I wasn't sure I wanted to wait.

48
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,809
I decided to take a walk, 
I'd see later..

49
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:24,774
We haven't eaten for two days.

50
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,477
Will you give me rice for my son?

51
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,088
You again!

52
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,192
When you beg, be polite 
and don't stir up trouble!

53
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,295
Take this.

54
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,795
Thank you. Thank you.

55
00:06:42,935 --> 00:06:46,962
Chansong, It's rice. Eat it.

56
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:55,005
I want some sugared water. 
Keep the rice for yourself.

57
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:58,879
I'm not hungry. Eat.

58
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,492
Chansong! 
What's the matter?

59
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,494
- Mom! 
- Why?

60
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,895
Mom! I want sugared water.

61
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,295
Here.

62
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,305
What's wrong, my baby?

63
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,103
My son Is sick. 
My son Is sick.

64
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,507
It's typhus!

65
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:31,083
Chansong, say: mom.

66
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,583
Say: mom!

67
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:42,384
Mom!

68
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:06,179
Yongsil had waited for me.

69
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,583
We decided to go to a bar 
instead of going to eat.

70
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,394
I felt like smoking. 
I bought some cigarettes.

71
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:34,812
Personally...I didn't think 
I'd see you again, Sangwon.

72
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:37,677
Me neither..

73
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,783
It's so strange and unexpected.

74
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:48,883
Are you mad at me? 
Are you mad at me, Sangwon?

75
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,895
Answer. Tell me the truth.

76
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:00,199
Give that back, It's my glass. 
Drink from your own.

77
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,601
Stop it.

78
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,579
We had realized one day 
we were drawn to each other..

79
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,883
But things weren't possible 
between us.

80
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:24,194
She was going out 
with one of my friends,

81
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,390
so I gave her up.

82
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,107
We'll end up doing something stupid.

83
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:43,682
Do you want me... 
to be your mistress?

84
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,782
Very funny!

85
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,188
Don't laugh, please.

86
00:09:55,027 --> 00:10:01,990
Sangwon! 
Do you want me to be your mistress?

87
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:28,088
Later, if we live apart 
if, when I think of the past

88
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:40,503
I can still tell myself that it was love 
That will be enough for me

89
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,101
Now I know 
a love that is too deep

90
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:52,980
Comes to an unhappy end

91
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:58,989
I shall pray, my love 
for my next love

92
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:05,155
To be different from ours 
And so know no suffering

93
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,406
We had obtained permission 
to stay out all night.

94
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:23,982
I was embarassed to hear Yongsil 
lie so well on the phone.

95
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,381
Personally, I probably overdid it.

96
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,988
Where shall we go? 
Do you want to go home?

97
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,890
I don't feel like it.

98
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,600
But you can if you want.

99
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,806
We decided not to go home.

100
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:56,611
Do you feel ill? 
Are you okay? Do you feel ill?

101
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,081
I think I'm going to die.

102
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,887
Are you okay? 
Do you want me to hold you?

103
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,088
Yes, please.

104
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:31,582
Let go of me, I'll do it...
I'll do it.

105
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,986
Sangwon...

106
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,894
Me too...

107
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,084
You're hurting me.

108
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,388
Sorry...

109
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,882
You've had enough, I'm sorry.

110
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:41,976
Why insist when it doesn't work?

111
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,797
I feel good.

112
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,992
Stay like that.

113
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,599
You're tired.

114
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,401
Why did you leave high school?

115
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,202
My teacher was a pervert.

116
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,880
Always feeling me up...

117
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:22,793
I see. 
How long have you been working?

118
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:26,193
I couldn't go on doing nothing.

119
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:31,193
But I'll resume my studies.

120
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:36,297
I'll get my credits transferred. 
I'll learn Japanese.

121
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,902
I'd like to live in Japan.

122
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,084
Come here.

123
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,203
Wiped out by exhaustion,

124
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,702
I had a strange dream.

125
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:23,279
While looking for the toilets, 
I reached a landing.

126
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,803
Do you want an apple?

127
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,683
When I woke, I tried again.

128
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:03,488
- You're hurting me. 
- Sorry.

129
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,710
You're fed up?

130
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:26,682
No. 
But why do you insist?

131
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:35,890
I'd like to die. 
End with a flourish.

132
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,289
Dying would be good.

133
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,601
Why do you want to die?

134
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,610
I don't know... No reason. 
I really want to die.

135
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,179
Me too, I want to die.

136
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,887
Are you serious?

137
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:11,993
Me too, I want to die. 
Let's die together.

138
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:21,502
Let's die clean, 
let's not make love.

139
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,400
All right...

140
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,486
Enjoy it.

141
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:46,297
It's delicious.

142
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,491
it is.

143
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,893
Do you want...?

144
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,995
What for?

145
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,999
if you want to write something.

146
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,076
What are you going to write?

147
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,889
I'll say it all before I die.

148
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:51,189
I'll dry my hair.

149
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:19,680
They counted two nights 
instead of a day and a half.

150
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,283
We went to several pharmacies

151
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,081
to buy 80 sleeping pills.

152
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,088
You want a coffee?

153
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,491
No, I'm just putting the coins in.

154
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:03,099
it will make someone happy.

155
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:35,991
What a nice smell of coffee!

156
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,375
I wanted to be honest with Youngsil.

157
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,901
Wait!

158
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,593
I wanted to throw myself 
on the tracks.

159
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:41,777
On our way back up, 
I told her: let's die together..

160
00:24:16,721 --> 00:24:19,383
You cry, then you laugh, stupid!

161
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,003
I've never been up there.

162
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,911
Some other time.

163
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,893
- Marlboro reds. 
- I don't have foreign brands.

164
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:13,609
- No Marlboro reds? 
- No.

165
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,482
Some "88s" then,

166
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,385
- soju and some dried squid. 
- All right.

167
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,797
What are you doing?

168
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,381
I wanted Marlboro reds.

169
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,079
Too bad.

170
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:10,796
They're divided up.

171
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,299
That's a lot of pills.

172
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:18,608
Youngsil, let's not make love.

173
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,413
We won't go to bed.

174
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,071
You're right.

175
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,979
I'll go and wash.

176
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:28,483
Okay.

177
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,599
We wanted to be clean to die.

178
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:54,703
While waiting, 
I almost took all the pills.

179
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:03,585
- Take your shower. 
- Yes.

180
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:31,181
I was afraid she would take 
all the pills in my absence.

181
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:41,885
What?

182
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,393
- Nothing. 
- You want something?

183
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,394
Dry your hair.

184
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,504
Oh, It's snowing...

185
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,309
It's snowing!

186
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,104
it is?

187
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,077
What a coincidence!

188
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:07,685
Is it pretty?

189
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,886
It's pretty. 
Very pretty.

190
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:15,793
I'll look later.

191
00:28:45,523 --> 00:28:48,492
She was really 
going to die with me.

192
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:04,792
Hello.

193
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,397
Sangwon has had an accident.

194
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,591
We're in Namsan.

195
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:13,101
Hello? I can't hear you. 
What did you say?

196
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:18,904
Sangwon has had an accident? 
What kind of accident?

197
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:25,881
An accident. 
He's lying here...

198
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:29,783
Come quickly.

199
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:34,881
Where is he? 
Where are you?

200
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:37,085
in Namsan.

201
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,597
She had woken, 
she had gone home.

202
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:59,280
She used my cell phone 
to alert my family.

203
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:42,491
Sangwon! 
Sangwon, wake up!

204
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,695
Wake up!

205
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:54,203
What happened?

206
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,408
Sangwon!

207
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:37,673
Sleep.

208
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:41,585
You need it. Are you in pain?

209
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,688
A little. It's okay.

210
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:52,393
Sir... 
Or should I call you father?

211
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,493
What?

212
00:33:56,134 --> 00:34:01,401
What are you talking about?

213
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:06,304
I'm going for a cigarette. 
I'll come back.

214
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,377
Excuse me.

215
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,299
Have I been asleep long?

216
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:40,002
Two hours or so.

217
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,009
Don't talk.

218
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:49,885
I would have liked 
to impress the nurse.

219
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,683
Since I was going to live,

220
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:56,191
I'd have liked to find 
a girl like her.

221
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:01,596
Can we remove the IV?

222
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:05,395
Sorry? No. 
Wait a little.

223
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,401
You're too impatient.

224
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:20,081
I was worried about 
the reception I was going to get.

225
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,776
We'll take a cab.

226
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:31,589
I looked around for Youngsil.

227
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,375
I felt 
as if I was starting a new life.

228
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,885
A gift that had been given to me.

229
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:11,295
Who did you want to die with?

230
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:12,697
A girl, huh?

231
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,303
You need a girl for that too?

232
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,306
It's not that.

233
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:37,390
- Give it to me. 
- It's okay.

234
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,996
if you want. Be careful.

235
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,796
So you wanted to kill yourself!

236
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,996
Think you're capable of it?

237
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,300
What kind of stupid act Is this?

238
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:55,208
Drop dead! Why have you 
come back? You're just a clown!

239
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,577
I apologize, mom.

240
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,782
But let me give you my reasons.

241
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:05,980
Your reasons?

242
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:10,184
You have reasons? 
Explain!

243
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,497
I...

244
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:20,900
I've always found it hard 
communicating with you.

245
00:37:21,038 --> 00:37:22,403
You know that.

246
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,308
For nineteen years now,

247
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:31,279
I've felt you don't understand me.

248
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,384
What a pretty speech! Shut up!

249
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,681
I'm hard to communicate with?

250
00:37:37,822 --> 00:37:41,189
I've always given you 
what you wanted.

251
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,589
And now It's all my fault?

252
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:48,188
He's not entirely wrong. 
You can be difficult.

253
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:50,300
What the hell do you know?

254
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:55,596
You blame your mother 
and you call yourself a man?

255
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,503
I killed myself raising you

256
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,509
and you insult me, you little shit!

257
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:04,672
You say It's because of me 
that you want to die?

258
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:08,478
So die! Why have you come back?

259
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,086
Mom!

260
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:13,486
Can't you let me speak?

261
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:21,789
I Understand. 
I fucking understand!

262
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:27,800
I'm going to kill myself for real.

263
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,699
I may as well kill myself!

264
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,106
Goddam maniac!

265
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,213
Be polite with mom.

266
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,474
Stay out of this.

267
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,982
Sit down.

268
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,896
Nobody cared.

269
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:49,782
Mom! Mom!

270
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:16,980
I got the letter this morning too.

271
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,979
Is it that serious?

272
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:26,181
He won't last much longer. 
There's no hope.

273
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:31,386
His old classmates are meeting tonight 
to do a collection.

274
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:36,193
It's to help hisfamily.

275
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,894
Besides, it's a long time 
since we last saw you.

276
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:42,301
Come tonight.

277
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:48,504
Actually, I wanted to see his retrospective. 
I'm at the cinema.

278
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:52,377
Really? 
I'm thinking of going too.

279
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,677
They're showing all hisfilms?

280
00:40:54,819 --> 00:41:00,883
Three shorts and a feature. 
it ends tomorrow.

281
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:06,588
I won't be able to go. 
We'll expect you tonight.

282
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:15,399
I have a lot to do, 
but I'll come if I can.

283
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:21,307
Thanks for calling me. 
Are you well?

284
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,777
Me? I'm fine.

285
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:30,483
Right, I'll be going now.

286
00:42:56,273 --> 00:43:01,745
The hospital and operation costs 
have reached one hundred million wons...

287
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,379
Such details are obscene!

288
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,706
What are you doing here?

289
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:38,178
And you? It's been ages.

290
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,985
You came to see the film, 
so did I.

291
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:49,083
You're looking better, healthier.

292
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,588
Marlboro reds?

293
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,992
Like in the film?

294
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:01,502
From time to time.

295
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:06,008
Let me have one. 
I've always been tempted.

296
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:14,277
Did you see the film?

297
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:19,583
I'd seen it before. 
This was the second time.

298
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,190
His films are good.

299
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,592
It's charming...

300
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,990
Are you coming tonight?

301
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:34,196
I'm not sure. 
What should I do?

302
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:42,406
I'm having lunch 
with my wife and children.

303
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:43,979
Want to come?

304
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:50,075
- To have lunch? 
- Join us, have you eaten?

305
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,088
It's just that... 
I have so many people to see.

306
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,091
Let's go.

307
00:45:01,832 --> 00:45:03,595
How many children?

308
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:06,396
- Two. 
- That's good.

309
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,371
You can eat a whole portion?

310
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:23,179
- Sure! You bet we can! 
- Yes, we can.

311
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,187
Two portions of shrimp then.

312
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,087
Two shrimps, 
one sweet-and-sour pork,

313
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,195
three noodles.

314
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:36,197
- What an appetite... 
- They love shrimps.

315
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,893
You don't want any noodles?

316
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:41,903
No. We'll see later.

317
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:50,575
- Don't smoke. 
- I'm not smoking.

318
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:58,486
You came to see his film.

319
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:01,182
You were close to him, 
weren't you?

320
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:07,886
At university, yes. 
But I'd stopped seeing him.

321
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,397
You have things in common.

322
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:11,694
Such as?

323
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:18,001
You act cool, 
you love women.

324
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:21,908
Your film would have been 
in the same vein, right? Come on...

325
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:29,281
in any case, I've never eaten a beef rib

326
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,979
as good as the one at your place.

327
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,987
A beef rib?

328
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:38,788
- Yes...That was years ago! 
- You remember that?

329
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:41,591
It's kind of you to remember.

330
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:47,898
it was really good.

331
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:51,405
The meat melted in your mouth.

332
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:59,075
Do you remember how many times 
you complimented your wife?

333
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:00,979
Complimented my wife?

334
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,382
You did that?

335
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,387
Six times. 
I remember counting.

336
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:08,684
You complimented her six times.

337
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:12,286
You remember such odd things!

338
00:47:14,631 --> 00:47:18,897
I'd never heard anyone 
make compliments about food.

339
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:46,687
Mom, I think I have a fever. 
I feel cold.

340
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,492
Really? Let me see.

341
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,498
You're hot.

342
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:55,594
Perhaps It's indigestion. 
Do you feel cold?

343
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:56,899
What's wrong?

344
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,908
She says she feels cold. 
Let's go home.

345
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,971
Come here.

346
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,174
There's no need.

347
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:11,378
She's cold. 
Feel better?

348
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:12,180
Yes.

349
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:22,597
Thank you. Where are you going? 
I'm going home before the meeting.

350
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,395
Want a ride?

351
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:28,402
I haven't made my mind up yet.

352
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:31,803
Get in. I'll drop you off somewhere.

353
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:36,402
- It's at six? 
- Yes. Come. They'll all be there.

354
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,873
I like the color of your car..

355
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:41,675
Get in, It's cold.

356
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,389
Thanks.

357
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:33,703
- How do you feel? 
- it hurts.

358
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:36,897
We'll soon be home.

359
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,882
Can I smoke?

360
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:57,187
Wait a bit. 
Because of the children.

361
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,795
All right.

362
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,802
Can you drop me here?

363
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:22,977
- Here? Why? 
- No reason. I have to...

364
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,283
- Let me out here. 
- All right.

365
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:41,800
Thank you.

366
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:50,177
I'd let you keep it,

367
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,281
but my mother bought it for me.

368
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:53,383
Sorry.

369
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,576
Bye.

370
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,880
it was good to see you.

371
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:01,388
Okay. Close the door. 
Hurry!

372
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,692
I'll close the door.

373
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,081
It's visible all over the city.

374
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:58,881
You're beautiful! Hurry, hurry. 
Just a second, please.

375
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:02,576
- What's your name? 
- Kanghi.

376
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,186
- Kanghi? 
- Yes.

377
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:09,588
You're really beautiful!

378
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:12,092
- Really! 
- Thank you.

379
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:18,691
We're big fans! Goodbye.

380
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:37,670
Goodbye.

381
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,076
Hello.

382
00:53:41,618 --> 00:53:43,085
Hello.

383
00:53:46,022 --> 00:53:48,081
Are you on a pilgrimage?

384
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:53,686
I'm sorry? What do you mean? 
Do we know each other?

385
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:58,494
Who doesn't know Choe Youngsil? 
I admire you.

386
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:04,606
I'm not a star. 
Thank you anyway.

387
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:10,675
We just saw the same film. 
Are you returning to the locations?

388
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,681
You're so classy!

389
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,479
What makes you say that?

390
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,884
I went to the same film school 
as the director.

391
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,889
He spoke about you. 
I know things about you.

392
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,893
I could even have gone on the set.

393
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:29,590
- Are you going to Namsan next? 
- To Namsan?

394
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:34,103
No.

395
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:38,503
Talking of Namsan, Is that where

396
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,202
his classmates are meeting?

397
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:47,579
Will you be there? 
Why?

398
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:52,984
I've been asked 
to contribute to the collection.

399
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:57,492
I'd like to go, 
but I may not be able to.

400
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:00,391
I Understand.

401
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,192
What about you?

402
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:09,602
I ought to go, but... 
not everyone there likes me.

403
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:15,109
I see. 
Are you a director too?

404
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,872
Yes, how did you know?

405
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:20,781
You were at the same school.

406
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:26,082
Be in my film when I shoot it.

407
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:27,883
I'm serious.

408
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:33,291
if you were to accept, 
that would be a big help.

409
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:38,399
Why not? 
Send me the screenplay.

410
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,901
All right.

411
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:43,904
Can I have your address?

412
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,710
I'm not sure. 
I don't know you.

413
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:56,775
if I see you this evening, perhaps... 
I prefer that.

414
00:55:57,721 --> 00:56:02,784
if you want. 
Let's shake hands.

415
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:07,492
All right. 
Like in the film?

416
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:56,607
We shall not leave in the loved one's 
heart nothing but light memories

417
00:56:56,713 --> 00:57:02,379
Now I know 
A love that is too deep

418
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:11,518
Comes to an unhappy end 
I shall pray, my love

419
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:34,575
- Here you are! 
- It's been ages.

420
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:37,277
Hello.

421
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:41,183
- Sit down here. 
- Thanks.

422
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:44,889
It's really been ages!

423
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,393
You're late!

424
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:50,090
I walked 
from the top of the hill.

425
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:52,497
Really? Why?

426
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:58,301
No reason. 
I've lost my wallet. I'm broke.

427
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,500
What about your credit card?

428
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,804
I'm beyond my credit limit.

429
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:05,774
You'll never change.

430
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:11,180
Sorry about earlier. You understand, 
It's a gift from my mother.

431
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,586
I didn't know if we'd meet again.

432
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:17,591
That's all right. Forget it.

433
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,787
Vice-chairman, 
how much must we donate?

434
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:24,388
I've lost my wallet, 
I'm a bit short.

435
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:29,198
Give what you can. 
Go ahead. Whatever you can spare.

436
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:34,402
- Here. It's not much. 
- Thank you.

437
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:37,479
Do you still drink as much?

438
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:43,484
No, I don't drink anymore. 
I have to think of my health.

439
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:47,488
I'm getting older. 
I met some people up there,

440
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:50,184
but I didn't drink.

441
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:56,890
You're right, you're no spring chicken. 
But you're looking better..

442
00:58:57,834 --> 00:59:00,394
I don't like drinking anymore.

443
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,904
Have a glass anyway.

444
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,405
Thank you.

445
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,180
Don't get drunk, please.

446
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:28,395
What's your problem? 
What's the matter?

447
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:32,490
- It's been ages, hasn't it? 
- Stop it!

448
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:36,594
Muscular. Do you work out? 
You're muscular.

449
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:43,372
Tongsu! if you plan to get drunk, 
say so. Understand?

450
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:48,677
I Understand.

451
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:52,276
- I think I've walked too much. 
- Have some meat.

452
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,585
Thank you.

453
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:57,989
it looks good.

454
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,599
Enjoy it.

455
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:51,469
Miss Choe Youngsil! Good evening. 
You're so beautiful!

456
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,479
Good evening.

457
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:58,485
How do you do?

458
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:17,998
- What do you want me to sing? 
- "If I loved again.", please

459
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:38,091
My name Is Choe Yongsil. 
I'm an actress.

460
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:49,094
Your older colleague Yi Hyongsu... 
Some here are the same age...

461
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:54,505
He allowed me 
to make my film debut.

462
01:01:54,644 --> 01:02:00,981
I haven't seen him for a long time.

463
01:02:01,117 --> 01:02:05,383
It's his fault as much as mine.

464
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:08,581
But, at this moment in time,

465
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:12,991
I feel as if It's my fault.

466
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:19,591
Mr. Yi, I'm really, 
really sorry.

467
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:31,677
We shall make no promises 
Even if we part

468
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:41,587
We'll be able to move away from each other. 
Without too much pain

469
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:53,693
We shall not leave  In the loved one's heart 
Nothing but light memories easy to cast aside

470
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:59,706
Now I know 
A love that is too deep

471
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:09,183
Comes to an unhappy end 
I shall pray, my love

472
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:18,226
For my next love to be different 
from ours and so know no suffering

473
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:28,698
We're all fans of yours.

474
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:31,204
Thank you for coming.

475
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,398
Thank you.

476
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:35,102
Would you do a commercial for me?

477
01:03:35,244 --> 01:03:36,871
I'd be delighted.

478
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,573
- Wonderful! It's been a pleasure. 
- For me too.

479
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:42,081
Don't look down on serials.

480
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:46,587
I don't look down on anything.

481
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:48,087
Go back inside.

482
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:50,385
- Take care. 
- Goodbye.

483
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:02,596
Where are you going?

484
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:09,501
You scared me. 
Where have you been?

485
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:16,377
No reason to be scared. 
I was the one who chose the song.

486
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,578
I know.

487
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,490
Where are you going?

488
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:23,990
Me?

489
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:33,000
I'm going to Kyonghi University Hospital. 
To see Yi.

490
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:35,103
I see.

491
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,703
Can you visit this late?

492
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:40,706
I don't know.

493
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:44,870
I'll see. 
They're saying It's serious.

494
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:48,677
I must go too. 
Shall I come with you?

495
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,078
I'm going alone.

496
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:56,783
- Stay with your friends. 
- That's not important.

497
01:05:04,634 --> 01:05:10,004
What's the matter? 
You're a strange guy.

498
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:18,173
Is it tough being an actress? 
Can I tell you about my ideal?

499
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:27,188
No. The taxi Is here. 
Go back in.

500
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:52,881
I didn't know you had a limp.

501
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:55,882
What? You didn't?

502
01:05:56,819 --> 01:06:02,086
Don't talk rubbish! 
Has she left?

503
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:05,489
She's really pretty.

504
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:10,395
- She's a good actress. Too bad. 
- What?

505
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:18,001
Nobody offers her anything 
since her accident.

506
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:21,101
What accident?

507
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:25,179
She had a friend. An artist.

508
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:30,183
When she tried to leave him, 
he attacked her.

509
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,581
Is that true?

510
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:35,589
She's covered with scars.

511
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:39,889
She's had several operations 
in the USA.

512
01:06:40,029 --> 01:06:43,192
But she still has some,

513
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:47,792
especially in intimate places.

514
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,495
Really?

515
01:06:49,638 --> 01:06:52,300
What places?

516
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:55,205
How should I know?

517
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:59,474
in certain places... 
intimate places.

518
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,276
Give me a cigarette.

519
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:16,392
You never noticed I limped?

520
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:48,288
I find you everywhere I go!

521
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:55,593
Yes. I'm broke. 
I've lost my wallet.

522
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,007
That's a nuisance.

523
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:02,406
I have some cigarettes left 
and enough for the subway.

524
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:07,280
Do you want me 
to lend you some money?

525
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:11,182
That would be kind.

526
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:20,093
No, forget it.

527
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:25,997
Actually, my heart has a problem.

528
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,797
Buy me a drink instead.

529
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,806
Your heart has a problem?

530
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:40,075
Yes. Yongsil... 
you look like an angel...

531
01:08:49,525 --> 01:08:51,789
You're laughing?

532
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:55,693
You're saying that 
because of that angel statue.

533
01:08:55,831 --> 01:09:00,894
No, 
you're my feminine ideal.

534
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:11,369
You're repeating yourself. 
it made me cry.

535
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:16,985
You can tell, can't you?

536
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,988
Yes, I can. 
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.

537
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:25,885
Come with me, then.

538
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:31,998
it seems 
that Yi's condition Is serious.

539
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:33,499
What can we do?

540
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:37,706
Did the doctor tell you?

541
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:43,472
Yes, the one treating him. 
It's what he implies.

542
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:46,877
Today's dawn could be his last.

543
01:09:48,417 --> 01:09:50,783
I feel so sorry for him.

544
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,087
Today's dawn?

545
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:59,088
Come over here 
to smoke a cigarette.

546
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:03,891
Well, all right.

547
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:28,188
Why did you keep your name 
in the film?

548
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:29,985
Was it Yi's idea?

549
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:38,198
For a short film, it didn't matter.

550
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:41,098
Really?

551
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:45,196
Yi himself performed in the film.

552
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:51,075
While we were shooting it, 
everyone had a good time.

553
01:10:51,213 --> 01:10:53,773
Were you dating each other?

554
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,076
No...

555
01:10:59,722 --> 01:11:02,486
He's the one who gave me my start.

556
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:04,991
I'm grateful to him for that.

557
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:10,895
Thanks to that, I've appeared 
in some quality productions.

558
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:12,193
Yeah

559
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:23,577
I was shooting my second film,

560
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:32,177
when he called me. And... 
he said... I had made a lot of money.

561
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:37,190
That I had succeeded thanks to him. 
He was asking me for money.

562
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:41,089
It's tough being an actress!

563
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:50,895
He was preying on your pity. 
How much did he want?

564
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:57,673
He talked about a loan 
but wanted me to give it to him.

565
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:01,180
20 million wons.

566
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:09,983
That's what he wanted. 
I hesitated for a few days.

567
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:17,589
He called me back, we saw each other.
He apologized, in tears.

568
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:24,696
He was really crying. 
He said he had been drinking.

569
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:31,973
All the same, 
I never felt like seeing him again.

570
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,572
I see.

571
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:40,584
I have to tell you...

572
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:44,887
That film tells my story.

573
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:49,691
I had told it to him 
as a secret.

574
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:56,203
I can't forgive him 
for having made it public.

575
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:05,077
I was shocked. it was your story? 
What part? All of it?

576
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:12,586
All of it. Going to a hotel to die.

577
01:13:12,721 --> 01:13:15,588
Sharing out the pills one by one. 
I told him everything.

578
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:20,388
Even the snow before the suicide, 
the Marlboro reds

579
01:13:20,529 --> 01:13:22,292
that I couldn't find. All that.

580
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:30,394
I like the bit with the Marlboros. 
You told him all that!

581
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:34,202
Not exactly,

582
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:39,371
but, back then, 
he saw me smoking them all the time.

583
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,578
Really?

584
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:51,882
When you're part of a filmmaker's entourage, 
you tend to think like that.

585
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:57,795
As soon as you spot a coincidence, 
you think It's because of you.

586
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:01,596
We all think 
the world revolves around us.

587
01:14:04,139 --> 01:14:08,508
But does all that really matter now?

588
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:09,975
Does it matter?

589
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:23,291
Tongsu.

590
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:26,883
I was just telling you all that.

591
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:39,903
What are we going to do?

592
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:43,876
We've had too much to drink.

593
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:51,176
Do you really bear a grudge 
against Yi?

594
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:57,281
He was a big influence on me.

595
01:14:57,426 --> 01:15:01,590
He did everything 
I'd have liked to do.

596
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:06,497
I was jealous. 
He was excessively proud,

597
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:12,005
although he had no reason to be. 
I'm as good as him.

598
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,405
He acted like my mentor 
and wanted me

599
01:15:15,544 --> 01:15:21,483
to recognize him as such. 
No way! I didn't like that.

600
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:28,483
Don't get angry. 
Don't hate him.

601
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,889
He's dying.

602
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:35,394
So are we.

603
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:40,400
You're exaggerating. 
I don't like that.

604
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:43,695
All right.

605
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:54,075
I'm too fond of drinking. 
Life Is too tough. It's too...

606
01:16:12,534 --> 01:16:14,092
Sorry.

607
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,605
I love you.

608
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,677
Do you mean it?

609
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:31,878
You're talking rubbish.

610
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:43,994
- You're forgetting your change. 
- Yes.

611
01:16:44,132 --> 01:16:45,690
Goodbye.

612
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:48,803
Thank you.

613
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:55,103
- That was delicious. Thank you. 
- You're welcome...

614
01:16:57,412 --> 01:17:00,779
Wrap up warmly.

615
01:17:04,519 --> 01:17:06,282
I'm drunk.

616
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:24,003
Be careful. 
Are you okay?

617
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:29,711
I don't feel good.

618
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:33,581
I'm sorry, It's my fault.

619
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:38,579
How dare you touch me?

620
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,688
it will be all right...

621
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:52,695
You're hurting me.

622
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:57,100
There's nothing special 
about an actress, you know.

623
01:17:57,239 --> 01:18:00,902
She's a woman like any other.

624
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:07,073
I know. 
I love you.

625
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:09,240
- Is that true? 
- That's good.

626
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:22,397
I love you so much.

627
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,091
Is that true? You like it?

628
01:18:26,134 --> 01:18:27,999
Yes.

629
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:34,404
I'd like to come. 
I'd really like to come.

630
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,408
I love you.

631
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:40,975
Make me come.

632
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:46,785
- No... stop it. 
- I'm sorry?

633
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,186
Stop it.

634
01:18:51,927 --> 01:18:52,985
I love you.

635
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:58,191
Stop it. 
Stop it.

636
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:06,601
Stop it.

637
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:30,994
What? 
Why are you looking at me?

638
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:35,593
No reason. 
You don't have any scars.

639
01:19:36,138 --> 01:19:39,301
Scars?

640
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,909
I was told you had scars.

641
01:19:42,043 --> 01:19:45,069
Who told you that? 
I have scars?

642
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:53,587
I can't tell you. 
Wait.

643
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:57,089
Wait.

644
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:06,491
Something wrong?

645
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:12,005
Why are you leaving?
What have I done?

646
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:16,668
Nothing. You haven't done anything. 
Why?

647
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,677
No reason.

648
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,981
What if we died?

649
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:32,492
if you want, before dying, 
we could live another six months!

650
01:20:32,627 --> 01:20:35,687
We'd love each other intensely.

651
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:40,094
Enough.

652
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,402
Are you going to stay? 
I'm leaving.

653
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:49,510
Don't go.

654
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:52,670
I'd like to rest a little longer.

655
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:56,375
I have to leave. 
I need to go somewhere.

656
01:20:56,518 --> 01:21:00,579
But will you come back?

657
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:04,681
Come back. Please.

658
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:08,792
I'll see. 
Go on, sleep.

659
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:11,990
Excuse me, but...

660
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:16,399
Leave me something 
that I can keep.

661
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,806
Something...?

662
01:21:34,623 --> 01:21:37,990
I don't think 
you really understood the film.

663
01:22:55,036 --> 01:22:56,594
Did you sleep well?

664
01:22:57,138 --> 01:23:02,804
I didn't sleep. 
I'm coming to see the patient.

665
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:07,174
It's true... 
You didn't know I was here.

666
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,977
Did you spend the night here?

667
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:18,187
Yes. His condition has improved. 
The crisis Is over.

668
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:22,387
Really? 
That's good.

669
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:25,893
But it could start again.

670
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:34,397
I have to go. 
Go on!

671
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:38,571
- Wait! 
- What?

672
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:42,581
You must be tired, 
but give me a second.

673
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:48,579
I'm worn out. 
I haven't slept.

674
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:55,688
You had a good time, 
so that's enough now!

675
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:14,775
Go home. Rest.

676
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:51,676
It'll be all right. 
What can I do?

677
01:24:56,024 --> 01:25:00,893
Tell me, how are you?

678
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:16,209
How... 
What are you doing here?

679
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:24,880
It's tough. it hurts too much. 
I think I'm going to die.

680
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:34,990
It'll be all right. 
What can I do?

681
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:41,797
I don't want to die. 
I really don't

682
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:50,569
it hurts. I don't want to die. 
I really don't

683
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:58,175
Don't say that! Don't say that! 
You're not going to die, trust me.

684
01:26:03,625 --> 01:26:10,087
I'm sorry, 
It's my fault.

685
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:14,700
Don't die!

686
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:25,577
Tongsu, I don't want to die. 
I want to live.

687
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:33,576
I want to live. 
I don't want to die.

688
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:36,485
Don't.

689
01:26:36,624 --> 01:26:40,583
You're not going to die, trust me.

690
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:07,586
I need to think now. 
Thinking is necessary.

691
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:12,689
With thought, 
I can sort everything out.

692
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:18,993
And even stop smoking. 
I have to think.

693
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:22,398
To get out of all this.

694
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:25,097
To live a long time.
