In time of economic crisis.

57
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:38,901
A time that asks the women of America

58
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:42,484
to play a role in every
sphere of the nation's life.

59
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:45,204
This we have prepared ourselves to do.

60
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:48,084
In the arts, in the sciences,

61
00:03:48,117 --> 00:03:51,061
in industry, and in the making of our laws.

62
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,300
In politics,

63
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,628
we believe that all shades of
opinion are entitled to a hearing.

64
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,508
And we believe,

65
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,940
as we take up our separate roles,

66
00:04:01,973 --> 00:04:06,069
that it is only in achieving the
highest personal fulfillment,

67
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:08,245
the goal of our education,

68
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:12,469
that each will make the greatest
contribution to our emergent America.

Hail, '33, your class correspondent,

77
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:56,085
Helena Davison signing in.

78
00:04:56,116 --> 00:04:58,357
Send all tidbits, gossip welcome.

79
00:04:58,388 --> 00:05:01,268
Hot off the griddle. Kay Strong,
the first to be married to Harald,

80
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,277
with an "A," Peterson, a
budding genius of the theater.

81
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:06,676
The day, June 10th, the place, St.
Mark's Church,

82
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:07,924
St. Mark's Place, New York.

83
00:05:07,956 --> 00:05:09,204
Really, Helena.

84
00:05:09,236 --> 00:05:13,044
Invitations orally by the
bride, no parents present.

85
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:14,804
Most unconventional.

86
00:05:14,837 --> 00:05:16,916
Harald Peterson.

87
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:18,612
Who'd a thunk it?

88
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:22,260
A church wedding, hah?

89
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:24,276
Kay, the scoffer and atheist.

90
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:27,060
She would.

91
00:05:27,092 --> 00:05:28,724
She'll introduce him as a Yale man.

92
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:30,580
He only did a little graduate work in drama.

93
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:33,620
Typical of Kay, used to drive us wild.

94
00:05:33,652 --> 00:05:35,700
But Kay's a darling.

95
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:38,004
Mother, Kay has been living
with Harald for a year.

96
00:05:38,036 --> 00:05:40,244
Weekends in New York, even flaunting it.

97
00:05:40,276 --> 00:05:42,420
Libby, we've got to get organized.

98
00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:44,084
<i>Wedding presents first.</i>

99
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:45,684
<i>Individual or one from all of us?</i>

100
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:47,764
No, one from all of us.
So much cheaper that way.

101
00:05:47,796 --> 00:05:50,036
What about a reception?
Has Kay decided anything?

102
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:52,404
She's been angling like mad
for Pokey's townhouse.

103
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:55,059
Very posh, she'll love that.

104
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:57,844
Or next best, Long Island, the Prisses.

105
00:05:57,876 --> 00:06:00,404
Much as I'd love to do it for Kay, Priss,

106
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:04,051
your own wedding so soon now is all
a poor widow woman can manage.

107
00:06:04,756 --> 00:06:06,835
Mother!

108
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:09,300
What's the problem? Have them come up here.
How many? Twenty?

109
00:06:09,332 --> 00:06:11,508
I've cooked for 50 in my time.

110
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,036
With a staff of ten, Henry.

111
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:15,988
That's sweet of you, Father, but

112
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,580
it's too far, Harald has to be
back at the theater that evening.

113
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:20,756
No honeymoon?

114
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:22,996
Who thinks of honeymoons these days, Mother?

115
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:25,396
Especially if you've already had it.

116
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,659
Since there's only two days left and
Kay hasn't decided anything yet.

117
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:30,579
And we know that she can't
afford it, then Mother and I...

118
00:06:30,612 --> 00:06:31,860
Hold it, dear, she has.

119
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,196
She just called, a wedding breakfast.

120
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,508
She and Harald are throwing it.

121
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:37,268
<i>It's so much nicer that way.</i>

122
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:39,348
Really, Dottie, so much nicer.

123
00:06:54,068 --> 00:06:55,699
Who are they?

124
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:57,107
The groom's team.

125
00:07:04,755 --> 00:07:06,548
Who's the good-looker?

126
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:07,796
Harald's painter friend.

127
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,043
The neighbor?

128
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:11,540
And Kay's, dear, on weekends.

129
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,796
Where is the breakfast?

130
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:17,267
Brevoort.

131
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:19,795
Charming old hotel.

132
00:07:19,828 --> 00:07:21,427
So much more appropriate,
don't you think, Libby?

133
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:22,643
What?

134
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:24,307
Kay giving the breakfast.

135
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:27,156
City Hall would have been more
appropriate too, I think.

136
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:30,323
Instead of trying to carry off a
wedding in Peter Stuyvesant's church.

137
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:32,499
Harald not to the manor born, exactly.

138
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:43,827
Doesn't she know a black hat
is bad luck for weddings?

139
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:51,603
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God...

140
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:54,675
My God! Harald in brown suede shoes.

141
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,859
Shut up.

142
00:07:56,755 --> 00:07:58,547
Into this holy estate,

143
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,075
these two persons present
come now to be joined.

144
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:04,243
If any man can show just cause

145
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,995
why they may not be
lawfully joined together,

146
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:11,603
let him now speak or else
hereafter forever hold his peace.

147
00:08:11,635 --> 00:08:16,019
Katherine Leslie, wilt thou have
this man for thy wedded husband,

148
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:18,515
to live together after God's ordinance

149
00:08:18,547 --> 00:08:20,435
in the holy estate of matrimony,

150
00:08:20,467 --> 00:08:22,355
so long as you both shall live?

151
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:24,019
I will.

152
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:25,426
Hey, Kay, we're going with you.

153
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,027
Goodbye, everybody!

154
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:38,643
I still think that we should have
done something about the reception.

155
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:40,434
No, I don't agree.

156
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:43,699
There's certainly no need to
encourage Kay's pretensions.

157
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,107
How hard you can be, Lakey.

158
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:48,114
Yet Kay adores you.

159
00:08:50,099 --> 00:08:53,299
And you used to like her best
in your heart of hearts.

160
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:57,491
You might spare me a cliche
like "heart of hearts," Dottie.

161
00:08:58,451 --> 00:09:00,179
Let me off here, please.

162
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,786
Lakey, aren't you coming?

163
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,835
Go ahead.

164
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:12,114
A toast to the bride and groom.

165
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:14,067
- Down the hatch.
- Down the hatch.

166
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:20,498
Where's Lakey?

167
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:23,827
She was feeling awful.

168
00:09:23,859 --> 00:09:26,674
Terrible cramps. She had to
go to the hotel and lie down.

169
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:28,498
Is that true, Libby? True?

170
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:31,314
Why, Kay.

171
00:09:31,347 --> 00:09:34,067
There's a little drugstore on
the corner of 59th Street.

172
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:36,178
All the prescription whiskey you want.

173
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,866
Say, this Italian showed
me how to make anisette.

174
00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:40,947
You take water, straight alcohol

175
00:09:40,978 --> 00:09:43,923
and oil of anise. That gives it
the milky color like in Pernod.

176
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:45,106
Boy!

177
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:47,858
Kay, where did you get this man?

178
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,386
I know Harald way back when,

179
00:09:50,418 --> 00:09:52,178
high school in Boise.

180
00:09:53,298 --> 00:09:55,794
Isn't Kay a honey?

181
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:58,162
How come her parents didn't show?

182
00:09:58,194 --> 00:10:01,234
Well, I believe they sent a check
rather than make the trip, you know.

183
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,835
You're a friend of Harald's, aren't you?

184
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:05,234
Yes...

185
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:07,635
Since the fall of the
dollar, we occupied some

186
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,947
furnished rooms together.

187
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:13,266
Or perhaps you knew that.

188
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:17,074
An inelegant arrangement. The john, as
you girls call it, is down the hall.

189
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:20,467
And in the closet is an electric grill.

190
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:25,426
And hence you must excuse me if I
smell like a ham and egg sandwich.

191
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,795
And all of a sudden
she flies out of the cab.

192
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:30,834
Well, heaven knows why she
sounded terribly off Kay.

193
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:32,754
Well, Lakey is her own law.

194
00:10:35,026 --> 00:10:38,034
I must get the recipe for this.

195
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:40,658
Pity a brilliant fellow like
Harald is stage managing

196
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,642
instead of writing his plays.

197
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:45,714
But in a depression, anybody
is lucky to have a job.

198
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:48,274
I'm with Russeks myself.

199
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:50,066
Stylist.

200
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:54,418
You girls won't have to
scramble to jobs, I imagine.

201
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,626
Still, we'll all be pitching in. Yes.

202
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:58,898
You for instance? Teaching nursery school.

203
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,114
Nice.

204
00:11:00,146 --> 00:11:03,921
This stuff is very treacherous. Yeah.

205
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,393
Makes you quarrelsome, they say.

206
00:11:05,426 --> 00:11:07,154
I doubt that.

207
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:09,142
Applejack's the purest thing
you can drink, you know.

208
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,418
It's a natural product.

209
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:13,138
Chemistry major.

210
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,730
You paint, I believe.

211
00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:18,577
I try. And you?

212
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:22,161
I'll be in Settlement House work in Boston.

213
00:11:22,194 --> 00:11:23,506
Dottie, can I get you anything?

214
00:11:23,537 --> 00:11:25,138
No. All right.

215
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,050
Kay is a very vital person, don't you think?

216
00:11:34,034 --> 00:11:38,226
Not my type however. I don't like
girls with a low center of gravity.

217
00:11:39,986 --> 00:11:42,706
I prefer the boyish figure myself.

218
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:45,009
A narrow waist and tapering legs.

219
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:49,778
Thin women are more sensuous.

220
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,497
Scientific fact, the nerve ends
are closer to the surface.

221
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:56,273
Lakey! Lakey, I'm so glad you're here.
You all right?

222
00:11:56,306 --> 00:11:57,681
Just fine. Why? Why?

223
00:11:57,714 --> 00:11:59,186
You were at death's door in the taxi.

224
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:00,785
Well, I was never better.

225
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:03,313
So, she is Lakey.

226
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:06,705
Well, there's the little charmer herself.
Come on, you're three drinks behind.

227
00:12:06,737 --> 00:12:08,401
Kay...

228
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:10,514
Not the Settlement House type.

229
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:13,073
Dear no.

230
00:12:13,617 --> 00:12:14,706
Art history.

231
00:12:16,818 --> 00:12:19,185
She sails tomorrow for France, to study.

232
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:20,306
Food, everybody.

233
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:46,833
Baked Alaska!

234
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:48,914
Girls, look at it.

235
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:51,794
Childhood dreams come true, Kay.

236
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:55,153
It's every children's party in
the whole blessed United States.

237
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:58,321
It's Mount Whitney. It's Fujiyama.

238
00:12:58,353 --> 00:13:00,241
Libby writes, I imagine.

239
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:02,481
She's practically set with the publisher.

240
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:07,953
Hold it, hold it. To Harald's first play.

241
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,953
Consider it as good as written.

242
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:13,553
To Kay.

243
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,217
Directing Harald's first play.

244
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:18,833
There'll be a slight delay, girls.

245
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,496
I'm starting at Macy's in the fall.

246
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,241
Merchandising techniques.

247
00:13:24,273 --> 00:13:26,000
Harald and I both decided that I...

248
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:27,921
No, no, no, no, the little
woman decided first.

249
00:13:27,953 --> 00:13:29,297
She wants to get Harald on his way.

250
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:30,641
Great idea.

251
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:33,905
They freeze the ice cream hard as a rock

252
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:35,760
and then whoosh into the oven.

253
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:37,841
Between you and me, it's not
like mama used to make.

254
00:13:39,537 --> 00:13:43,217
Well, working conditions in some of our
hotels are way sub-standard, you know.

255
00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:44,305
Come again, dear.

256
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:46,705
Economics major, Emma, it runs in her blood.

257
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:49,521
Grandpa was reform mayor of New York.

258
00:13:49,552 --> 00:13:53,457
What in God's name does one
do with economics, honey?

259
00:13:53,488 --> 00:13:55,472
Consumer Division.

260
00:13:55,505 --> 00:13:57,232
Hang on, Roosevelt, here comes Priss.

261
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:02,417
To Priss, our only little Phi Beta Kappa.

262
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:04,017
That's how I got through.

263
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:07,280
To Priss's marriage. She's next.

264
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:13,073
The lucky fellow. A left-winger, no doubt.

265
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:15,536
Wrong, Emma. A Rhode Island Crockett.

266
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:18,545
Why not a left-winger if it comes to that?

267
00:14:18,577 --> 00:14:21,232
Nobody here is afraid of
being a little radical.

268
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:23,793
I mean who wants to marry a broker or
banker... Marry a broker or banker

269
00:14:23,824 --> 00:14:25,936
or coldfish corporation lawyer, right?

270
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:28,912
Helping Roosevelt too, honey.

271
00:14:29,776 --> 00:14:31,152
A Prothero?

272
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:33,520
Poke's gonna be a vet. She
has her own stable you know.

273
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,921
Commuting to Cornell's is
gonna be a frightful bore.

274
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:37,296
My daddy gave her a plane for that.

275
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:39,824
A little ol' two-seater.

276
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:44,432
To the class of '33.

277
00:14:50,736 --> 00:14:53,264
Although as a privileged
class, the upper middle,

278
00:14:53,296 --> 00:14:55,440
it's finished politically
and economically. What?

279
00:14:56,689 --> 00:14:59,536
Well, one day, one day
after a brief struggle,

280
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:01,360
capital will blend with government.

281
00:15:01,393 --> 00:15:03,024
Individual ownership will be obsolete.

282
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:04,944
Not so obsolete, Karl Marx.

283
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,096
All shades of opinion

284
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:13,232
are entitled to a hearing. Right?

285
00:15:16,944 --> 00:15:18,832
Hey, Harald, don't you have to go to work?

286
00:15:18,864 --> 00:15:21,392
No, no matinee today, Dave.
We have all afternoon.

287
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:23,376
You two are supposed to go away.

288
00:15:23,408 --> 00:15:24,400
Yeah. Where should we go?

289
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:26,096
Yeah, where should we go, Poke?

290
00:15:26,128 --> 00:15:28,112
Coney Island.

291
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:30,032
Coney Island?

292
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:31,152
Coney Island!

293
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:33,200
Coney Island!

294
00:15:34,928 --> 00:15:37,712
♪ We love you all the T-I-M-E, time

295
00:15:37,744 --> 00:15:40,624
♪ You are the B-E-S-T, best,
of all the R-E-S-T, rest ♪

296
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:51,088
Lakey, you stopped to buy rice.

297
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:53,743
Come on.

298
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:56,176
Goodbye.

299
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:02,832
Who'd a thunk it?

300
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:03,984
Thunk what?

301
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:07,056
Well, I mean, we never
thought she'd get him.

302
00:16:07,087 --> 00:16:09,040
For heaven's sakes.

303
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:10,640
Forget it.

304
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:12,943
Come, Poke, Harald's
terribly in love with her.

305
00:16:12,976 --> 00:16:15,760
In his histrionic way. But
you know, girls, it is true.

306
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:19,344
When she hinted about marriage, we all
thought it as pretty much of a myth.

307
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:21,743
And suddenly a wedding. In a God awful rush.

308
00:16:23,696 --> 00:16:26,224
There could be one reason, of course.

309
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:28,559
Well, maybe she is.

310
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:31,279
That's ridiculous. Kay
knew all about what to do.

311
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:32,399
To hear her tell it.

312
00:16:32,432 --> 00:16:34,096
All right, girls.

313
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,472
Let's get our minds off our plumbing.

314
00:16:35,504 --> 00:16:36,591
Plumbing?

315
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,023
Helena.

316
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,471
You staying to see Lakey off, Polly?

317
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,072
I'm in town for good.

318
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,992
I start at the hospital, Monday.

319
00:16:47,024 --> 00:16:49,264
That's wonderful. Monday, no vacation?

320
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:53,583
It may surprise you, Poke, but not everybody
is lolling at Newport this summer.

321
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:55,503
Lolling?

322
00:16:55,535 --> 00:16:57,040
Flying lessons all summer.

323
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:58,479
How tragic.

324
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,232
You found a place yet, Polly?

325
00:17:01,263 --> 00:17:02,992
A nice room and bath in the Village.

326
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,551
Village. That's so Bohemian, dear.

327
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:07,183
That's so cheap, dear.

328
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:08,623
Right.

329
00:17:08,656 --> 00:17:10,863
Hey, how about a farewell
party for Lakey tonight.

330
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:12,144
I'll treat.

331
00:17:12,175 --> 00:17:13,872
Swell!

332
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:15,984
Where did she and Dottie go, I wonder.

333
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:19,855
Off in a cab with Mr. Brown, last I saw.

334
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,831
Our art historian is not impressed.

335
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,295
Hello.

336
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:34,736
<i>Kay, how was it?</i>

337
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:37,743
Coney Island? Or when we got back?

338
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,144
<i>Is everybody there?</i>

339
00:17:40,175 --> 00:17:41,456
Poke and Priss had to go home.

340
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:44,143
And as for Polly, Phil came
into town unexpectedly.

341
00:17:44,175 --> 00:17:46,991
Phil? I thought that was
supposed to be finished.

342
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:48,591
<i>How about Lakey and Dottie?</i>

343
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:50,255
They haven't come back yet. <i>From where?</i>

344
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,935
From wherever they went from the Brevoort.

345
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:55,631
Well, let's just say, Mr. Brown,

346
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:58,671
that I have a blind spot where
modern painting is concerned.

347
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,623
We used to play a game at school.

348
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:03,119
When in history would you
like most to have lived?

349
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,911
In the Renaissance was
always Lakey's choice.

350
00:18:04,943 --> 00:18:06,095
Yes?

351
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,855
And what did you choose?

352
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:10,767
I never could decide.

353
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:13,839
And our friend, Kay?

354
00:18:13,871 --> 00:18:16,303
The year 2000 A.D., of course.

355
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:19,791
Looking ahead. Another way to say ambitious.

356
00:18:19,823 --> 00:18:23,119
There was another game that
Kay insisted on playing.

357
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:25,263
The truth game.

358
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:28,559
Everyone was to make a list of their
friends in order of preference and then

359
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,799
compare the lists.

360
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,039
What Kay never stopped to think about,

361
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,911
was that somebody always had to
be at the bottom of every list.

362
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:41,263
When that somebody cried,
Kay was honestly surprised.

363
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:43,310
She must have landed at the
bottom more often than not.

364
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:46,031
No, that's where you're wrong, Mr. Brown.

365
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:48,974
The others were too tactful
ever to put her there.

366
00:18:49,007 --> 00:18:52,558
Because the truth is, she was
a bit of an outsider, really.

367
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,734
And no one ever wanted her to feel that.

368
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,071
We have to go, really, I have to pack.

369
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:01,550
Girls, to all of you.

370
00:19:03,311 --> 00:19:05,231
All ashore that's going ashore.

371
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:09,071
All ashore that's going ashore.

372
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:16,591
Phil, let's go on a boat someday.

373
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:17,807
We'll see what we can do.

374
00:19:20,015 --> 00:19:22,191
Polly with Phil, would you believe it?

375
00:19:22,222 --> 00:19:23,374
Hey, what's the matter?

376
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:26,254
Hey, Harald. Hey, Dick!

377
00:19:26,287 --> 00:19:27,759
How are you? Bit late, old boy.

378
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,735
Too bad, I had some names for her.
Painters she wanted to meet in Paris.

379
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:33,007
You could send them to her. Bye, bye.

380
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:37,550
Be sure to send shoes.

381
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,486
They... Yes, they are size 38.

382
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,494
I could be consoled.

383
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:53,134
Let's you and I have dinner
tonight, for old time's sake.

384
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:56,366
Same place. By 8:00.

385
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:02,029
Helena, you've just got
to stay till tomorrow.

386
00:20:02,927 --> 00:20:04,751
Look, Harald got passes for tonight.

387
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:06,702
They're papering the house
till the show catches on.

388
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:08,814
Heaven help the Petersons if
it doesn't last the summer.

389
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:10,670
Look, when does nursery school open?
Next week.

390
00:20:10,702 --> 00:20:12,079
Then what's the rush?

391
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,582
Wednesday...

392
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:17,294
Yes, that'll be fine. Thank
you very much. Goodbye.

393
00:20:17,326 --> 00:20:19,054
It's set. Mr. Wharton himself.

394
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:21,518
That's wonderful. I'm mad to get started.

395
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:22,830
Now, look for one thing.

396
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:25,038
Harald says whatever job they
think of starting you at

397
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,662
make sure you tell them you need the work.

398
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:30,030
This New Weston address isn't
exactly a help you know.

399
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:32,462
Well, it just so happens I am
on the trail of something,

400
00:20:32,494 --> 00:20:33,710
a snazzy little place.

401
00:20:33,742 --> 00:20:35,758
With a snazzy little address I bet.

402
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,070
You all right, Dottie?

403
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:38,670
Missing Lakey, no doubt.

404
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:40,782
That was a laugh, Brown coming to the boat.

405
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:44,270
Fascinating man. That
restless chiseled face.

406
00:20:44,302 --> 00:20:46,510
Under that virile mask, as Harald calls it,

407
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,622
Dick's a warped personality, really.

408
00:20:48,654 --> 00:20:50,798
I've gotta dash. I'm due at typing.

409
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,653
Typing? That's right.

410
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:55,310
Harald says it's important
in a technological society

411
00:20:55,342 --> 00:20:57,262
to have a tool the other
trainees haven't got.

412
00:20:57,294 --> 00:20:59,277
Dottie, you'll be with us later?

413
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,974
I may not, Kay.

414
00:21:01,006 --> 00:21:02,509
May not?

415
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:05,774
I was thinking of going home today.

416
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,294
I was always being shipped off to
Arizona for a nasty little cough.

417
00:21:09,325 --> 00:21:10,745
It kept me out of school quite a lot.

418
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:14,478
That's why I'm the oldest
of us, actually. I'm 23.

419
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,461
I'm the old maid of the group.

420
00:21:18,829 --> 00:21:20,141
Are you sure?

421
00:21:21,774 --> 00:21:23,470
No, thank you, really.

422
00:21:27,629 --> 00:21:29,389
I'm afraid I'm boring you.

423
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:33,229
Not at all, I am very grateful

424
00:21:33,262 --> 00:21:35,790
for female companionship tonight.

425
00:21:36,813 --> 00:21:37,902
Even me?

426
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,550
If it can't be Lakey, that is.

427
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,942
She is very striking.

428
00:21:44,974 --> 00:21:47,214
Despite what she said it was Lakey
who brought Kay into the group.

429
00:21:47,246 --> 00:21:50,509
And now a tinge of sex envy.

430
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:54,542
In all of you perhaps. All of you vicariously
thrilled by Kay's little weekends.

431
00:21:54,574 --> 00:21:57,645
But secretly violated
in your nice little souls.

432
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,006
I wouldn't say that.

433
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,909
Well, certainly speaking for myself.

434
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:08,590
In fact, Mother and I,

435
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:13,709
she's awfully youthful and
modern in her point of view.

436
00:22:16,941 --> 00:22:18,125
We agree...

437
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,734
that...

438
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:25,581
if you're in love or engaged,

439
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:32,909
perhaps you ought to...

440
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:39,213
Well... That is...

441
00:22:40,622 --> 00:22:43,053
Like Harald and Kay, for example,

442
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:45,261
to make sure of a happy adjustment.

443
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:47,885
I see.

444
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:50,381
Well, I am religious.

445
00:22:50,413 --> 00:22:52,301
But more pantheistic than anything else.

446
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:55,661
I love the church for its ritual,

447
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:58,189
but I believe that God is everywhere.

448
00:22:58,221 --> 00:23:00,045
Even in my poor little room?

449
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:05,549
Pardon?

450
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:07,981
Do you want to come home with me tonight?

451
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:16,044
The smell of cooking fat is permanent.

452
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,941
Tenanted once by a friend of yours.

453
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,701
You don't see them anymore.

454
00:23:55,245 --> 00:23:56,461
Skylights.

455
00:23:58,381 --> 00:24:00,845
And a north window. It's
perfect for your work.

456
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:07,436
Modern design, the skyscraper concept.

457
00:24:07,469 --> 00:24:10,029
It has destroyed so many wonderful things.

458
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,212
Shall we discuss modern architecture?

459
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,980
It's like talking about current events.

460
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:21,453
Or anything at the dentist.

461
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:23,085
To delay the drill.

462
00:24:31,788 --> 00:24:34,189
That turned out rather funny, didn't it?

463
00:25:33,452 --> 00:25:35,404
Hello, Boston.

464
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,948
Congratulations.

465
00:25:56,428 --> 00:25:57,644
Dick.

466
00:26:02,283 --> 00:26:05,068
You know the books
Krafft-Ebing and the others.

467
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,620
They're not very explicit, really.

468
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,779
Kay was.

469
00:26:19,084 --> 00:26:21,100
Though she wasn't very happy at first.

470
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,059
I think... I think it's like dancing.

471
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:37,868
It's a matter of following.

472
00:26:41,387 --> 00:26:43,244
Kay was a terrible dancer.

473
00:26:45,868 --> 00:26:47,307
Do you think that could be it?

474
00:26:49,004 --> 00:26:50,572
Could very well be.

475
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,308
Dick.

476
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:57,836
Am I?

477
00:26:57,867 --> 00:27:00,876
There's nothing to be
concerned about, Boston.

478
00:27:00,907 --> 00:27:02,155
But for general reference,

479
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:03,852
it's the second door on your right.

480
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:09,739
Who'd a thunk it?

481
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:23,787
Could you send someone
up for the bags, please?

482
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:26,378
No. Miss Renfrew will be staying.

483
00:28:26,411 --> 00:28:28,075
I'd like to leave a message for her.

484
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:32,234
Could you tell her that her mother
called twice. Tell her it's urgent.

485
00:28:32,267 --> 00:28:33,450
Thank you.

486
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:48,747
You sure you don't want the news section?

487
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:00,138
Rather rude.

488
00:29:04,299 --> 00:29:05,482
Evidently.

489
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:11,435
I mustn't keep you from your work.

490
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:12,491
Boston.

491
00:29:14,698 --> 00:29:17,258
My poor little room is always yours.

492
00:29:20,906 --> 00:29:24,330
But, the right lady doctor
could make us a lot happier.

493
00:29:26,027 --> 00:29:27,978
You might ask your friend Kay.

494
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,714
I liked you last night, Boston.

495
00:29:32,746 --> 00:29:35,787
But don't harbor the idea that
I'm going to like it more.

496
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:37,707
All right.

497
00:29:37,738 --> 00:29:39,242
I want a man's life.

498
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:41,962
A bar.

499
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,307
Men's talk that's never driving
to get anywhere but just circles.

500
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:51,147
Give me a call after
you've been to the doctor.

501
00:29:51,178 --> 00:29:52,586
All right.

502
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:53,738
Boston.

503
00:29:55,978 --> 00:29:58,346
Aren't you going to take the phone number?

504
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:05,066
2-3-6-8.

505
00:30:07,178 --> 00:30:10,026
It's the landlady's phone.
I'll get the message.

506
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,018
Okay.

507
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:14,826
Boston. Goodbye.

508
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:17,738
And remember.

509
00:30:22,442 --> 00:30:24,938
- Hello, Dottie.
<i>- Hello, Mother.</i>

510
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:28,234
I'm awfully sorry. Helena left a
message saying that you called.

511
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:30,858
I would have called you but I was at Kay's.

512
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,506
Last night we just talked
and talked and talked.

513
00:30:34,538 --> 00:30:36,458
I was just wondering when
you might be coming back.

514
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,698
Well, I'd like to stay this trip.

515
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:40,714
And New York is so exciting and I...

516
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:42,570
I've been exploring.

517
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:46,090
The...

518
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:51,306
Brooklyn Bridge and Murray Hill and,

519
00:30:51,337 --> 00:30:53,290
<i>I'd like to see Kay and Polly,</i>

520
00:30:53,322 --> 00:30:55,018
<i>for another thing. You don't mind, Mother?</i>

521
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,418
No. Of course not, darling.

522
00:30:57,449 --> 00:30:58,570
Have a good time.

523
00:30:58,602 --> 00:31:00,138
Yes, I'll try.

524
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,249
I'll call you again tomorrow, all right?

525
00:31:02,282 --> 00:31:03,850
Goodbye, dear. <i>Goodbye.</i>

526
00:31:08,682 --> 00:31:11,849
Dottie! I thought you were in Boston.

527
00:31:13,546 --> 00:31:14,826
Well, I guess not.

528
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:16,553
Or did you just come back?

529
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:18,250
No.

530
00:31:18,282 --> 00:31:20,170
I had so many things to do the last minute.

531
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,881
Come in, Dottie. I'll be right with you.

532
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:32,873
Kay. For you.

533
00:31:32,906 --> 00:31:35,657
How nice, Dottie. Thank you.

534
00:31:36,842 --> 00:31:38,729
Boy, can this place use them!

535
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:41,546
We just have to get out of this
horrible sublet. Please sit down.

536
00:31:41,577 --> 00:31:42,825
You just missed Harald
by five minutes. Kay...

537
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:44,522
Kay. Please.

538
00:31:48,937 --> 00:31:50,569
I have come to tell you something.

539
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:56,138
Well, I...

540
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,809
I've taken Dick Brown

541
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:12,361
as my lover.

542
00:32:13,226 --> 00:32:14,825
You haven't!

543
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:17,226
Yes, I have. Last night.

544
00:32:24,425 --> 00:32:26,218
Dottie. It's not true.

545
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:32,393
"And please leave this room as
you would expect to find it."

546
00:32:32,425 --> 00:32:34,345
"Thank you for your cooperation."

547
00:32:41,865 --> 00:32:45,289
Dottie, you knew about Dick Brown.

548
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:47,529
What Harald said about him.

549
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:49,289
And you knew it was Lakey he was after!

550
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:52,329
I faced that.

551
00:32:52,361 --> 00:32:53,737
You faced that?

552
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:58,057
Dottie, you let him use you.

553
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:00,681
Well, perhaps I used him.

554
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:04,265
It is about time, don't you think?

555
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:07,977
The point is, I have
come to ask your advice.

556
00:33:08,009 --> 00:33:09,385
It's a bit late for that, isn't it?

557
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,673
No, I meant about these.

558
00:33:13,705 --> 00:33:15,336
There are so many possibilities.

559
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:16,809
And Dick was sure that you'd know.

560
00:33:18,601 --> 00:33:20,169
Dottie, where did you get those?

561
00:33:20,201 --> 00:33:22,345
From the Margaret Sanger Clinic, for one.

562
00:33:24,584 --> 00:33:27,816
They gave me the name of a lady doctor.

563
00:33:27,849 --> 00:33:31,337
Her clinic was raided for just this
sort of thing about a year ago.

564
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:33,609
Imagine. I have an appointment tomorrow.

565
00:33:35,977 --> 00:33:37,289
Sit down, Kay.

566
00:33:42,697 --> 00:33:44,585
I don't know anything about those.

567
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:46,505
You don't?

568
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:47,624
Well...

569
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,473
You must come with me.

570
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:53,496
I should have gone last year but I wouldn't
have the nerve until I was married.

571
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,968
Dottie, what name did you give?

572
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,656
What?

573
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:02,280
I mean, in whose name did
you make the appointment?

574
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:04,169
Well, you didn't...

575
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,369
You couldn't.

576
00:34:09,064 --> 00:34:10,537
Dorothy Renfrew, please.

577
00:34:16,457 --> 00:34:17,609
Hello, Dorothy.

578
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,177
How do you do, Doctor?

579
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:23,464
A few questions, Dorothy. Simple, natural
ones that needn't embarrass you.

580
00:34:23,496 --> 00:34:25,513
All right, Dorothy.

581
00:34:25,545 --> 00:34:26,728
Have you ever had... Once.

582
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,352
And may I ask was everything...

583
00:34:29,385 --> 00:34:30,984
Perfect.

584
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:34,632
End of questions. Everything's quite simple.

585
00:34:34,664 --> 00:34:37,000
Go into the bathroom
and take off your things.

586
00:34:37,768 --> 00:34:39,145
Thank you very much.

587
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,513
Dottie, you aren't leaving?

588
00:34:49,544 --> 00:34:51,144
I really must, dear. Ta-ta.

589
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:53,801
Mrs. Peterson, please.

590
00:34:55,688 --> 00:34:57,256
<i>He's not in.</i>

591
00:34:58,984 --> 00:35:02,888
Well, would you tell him that Miss Renfrew
called, please. That's Miss Renfrew.

592
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,088
And I'll call back. And,

593
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,704
if he should come in,
would you tell him, that

594
00:35:09,736 --> 00:35:12,072
I'm, I'm in Washington Square

595
00:35:12,104 --> 00:35:13,992
in the park, on a bench.

596
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:15,528
Would you tell him that, please?

597
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,776
<i>I'll tell him.</i> Thank you.

598
00:35:32,616 --> 00:35:36,424
And went out again? Well, when was that?

599
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:37,576
<i>About ten minutes ago.</i>

600
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,536
You did tell him? <i>Yeah.</i>

601
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:44,296
<i>Renfrew, Washington Square.</i>

602
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,695
Mr. Leroy, how nice.

603
00:36:18,728 --> 00:36:21,544
Miss MacAusland. Well, sit down.

604
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:23,495
Sorry, Mr. Wharton is unavailable.

605
00:36:23,528 --> 00:36:25,256
Well, another time, I hope.

606
00:36:25,288 --> 00:36:28,744
Yes, well, meanwhile,
he's asked me, one of his

607
00:36:28,776 --> 00:36:32,295
not un-respected editors
to see what I can do.

608
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:35,496
Let's see, copy editing, proof reading,

609
00:36:36,616 --> 00:36:39,623
editor of the literary magazine,

610
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,831
short story courses, very impressive.

611
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:43,463
Where to try you out is the problem.

612
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:49,352
Well, I did spy an empty cubbyhole in the
editorial department on my way through.

613
00:36:49,383 --> 00:36:52,424
You did? Well, actually,

614
00:36:52,455 --> 00:36:53,831
as means of getting acquainted,

615
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:56,328
I had in mind giving you
some manuscripts to read.

616
00:36:56,776 --> 00:36:58,407
Now,

617
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,672
we pay five dollars a piece
for reading the manuscript,

618
00:37:01,703 --> 00:37:03,879
and writing a summary and an opinion.

619
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:09,768
I wonder, you need the
work, Miss MacAusland?

620
00:37:09,799 --> 00:37:11,336
Yes, I do.

621
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:13,767
Well, you should be able to
do three or four a week.

622
00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:15,176
You see, you needn't read them all through.

623
00:37:15,207 --> 00:37:17,352
Most publishers' readers just smell them.

624
00:37:17,383 --> 00:37:20,551
My dear Mr. Leroy. I don't mind.

625
00:37:20,584 --> 00:37:23,655
And I'd like to scotch the legend that
manuscripts aren't read by publishers.

626
00:37:23,687 --> 00:37:26,023
You'll be able to swear on
the book that these were.

627
00:37:26,055 --> 00:37:30,247
And you can't object if I do
it on my own time. Can you?

628
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,095
I knew there'd be plants. The
green thumb of the Andrews.

629
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:35,015
Why, it's cute, Polly.

630
00:37:35,047 --> 00:37:37,256
The kitchen's a dream.

631
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:38,887
I'm making us some tea.

632
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:40,999
I can't, Polly. I haven't got time.

633
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:44,903
Some cake?

634
00:37:44,935 --> 00:37:46,951
Please. It's a recipe of Father's.

635
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:48,671
All right. I've got time for that.
All right.

636
00:37:50,183 --> 00:37:51,911
Polly, what have you done with your hair?

637
00:37:51,943 --> 00:37:54,183
It's neater for the hospital this way.

638
00:37:54,215 --> 00:37:56,423
Makes you look much older.

639
00:37:57,319 --> 00:37:58,759
Well...

640
00:38:00,647 --> 00:38:02,919
Wasn't it awfully sudden
Dottie going off to Arizona?

641
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:06,471
Libby told you.

642
00:38:06,503 --> 00:38:08,486
Well, I told her, of course.

643
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,503
What Libby doesn't know,

644
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:13,383
it wasn't exactly for her health this time.

645
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:15,367
You remember Brown?

646
00:38:15,399 --> 00:38:17,767
Well, poor Dottie, of all people.

647
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:19,623
It was something pretty
shattering, I gathered.

648
00:38:19,654 --> 00:38:21,127
No.

649
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:24,999
Excuse me.

650
00:38:29,158 --> 00:38:32,390
Hello, Mr. Schneider. Won't you come in?

651
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:33,735
No, thank you.

652
00:38:34,535 --> 00:38:36,103
A little present.

653
00:38:36,134 --> 00:38:38,471
Marzipan. How nice!

654
00:38:38,502 --> 00:38:40,615
Kay, this is Mr. Schneider.

655
00:38:40,647 --> 00:38:41,894
Hello.

656
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:43,431
Delighted.

657
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:46,055
Are you sure you won't join us?

658
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:47,815
This evening. This evening, maybe.

659
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:49,830
Yeah? All right. Thank you.

660
00:38:49,863 --> 00:38:51,846
Thank you so much. You're welcome.

661
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:56,294
It's in the shape of fruit.

662
00:38:56,327 --> 00:38:58,247
Look, strawberry.

663
00:38:58,279 --> 00:38:59,686
Who was that?

664
00:38:59,718 --> 00:39:01,127
It's my neighbor.

665
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:03,174
He's a lovely man. I help
him with his English.

666
00:39:03,206 --> 00:39:05,415
In return, he's helping me find a husband.

667
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,382
Why not tell him about Phil?
That should end that.

668
00:39:11,302 --> 00:39:14,950
Polly. You can't let this
engagement go on forever.

669
00:39:14,982 --> 00:39:16,743
You, you can't make up your mind.
That's the trouble.

670
00:39:16,775 --> 00:39:18,407
Because you know it isn't right.

671
00:39:19,878 --> 00:39:21,383
Your father, wonderful as he is,

672
00:39:21,414 --> 00:39:23,686
in and out of clinics with melancholia.

673
00:39:23,718 --> 00:39:25,254
He's enough liability in a marriage

674
00:39:25,286 --> 00:39:28,390
without adding insanity
in Phil's background too.

675
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:30,310
All right, if you love Phil, live with him.

676
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:32,391
Marry someone else when you
want to have children.

677
00:39:32,422 --> 00:39:34,727
I couldn't do that.

678
00:39:34,758 --> 00:39:36,774
Well, then, for heaven's
sakes, break it off!

679
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:42,503
Polly, you all right?

680
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:51,399
I have to go. I'll, call you tomorrow, okay.

681
00:39:57,958 --> 00:40:00,774
Miles of cubbyholes, an absolute factory.

682
00:40:00,806 --> 00:40:02,406
Hi, ready? One second, Libby.

683
00:40:02,438 --> 00:40:04,870
Our leader, big as life.

684
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,374
What did Sloan say to all this?

685
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:07,846
Running battle.

686
00:40:07,878 --> 00:40:10,086
At home, I'm surrounded by Republicans.

687
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:11,590
Come on, Priss. Leave
those dreary statistics.

688
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:12,966
I've only got time for a sandwich actually.

689
00:40:12,998 --> 00:40:14,150
Suits me.

690
00:40:14,182 --> 00:40:16,710
Masses of new work I'm dying to light into.

691
00:40:16,742 --> 00:40:18,950
Well, what do you think of it? Black calf.

692
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:21,446
Mark Cross. Snazzy? Very.

693
00:40:21,478 --> 00:40:23,270
How's it going? I'm a house on fire.

694
00:40:23,302 --> 00:40:25,350
Mr. Leroy is quite impressed.

695
00:40:25,382 --> 00:40:26,534
And I'm impressed with Mr. Leroy.

696
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:27,986
If he's not single, I'll kill myself.

697
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,269
You've heard about Polly, I suppose.
Heard what?

698
00:40:31,302 --> 00:40:32,710
Kay let her have it about Phil.

699
00:40:32,742 --> 00:40:34,534
Amazing how Kay can take a love affair

700
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,966
and return it shrunk and
labeled like the laundry.

701
00:40:36,998 --> 00:40:39,526
I got a card from Dottie.
Desert sunset. Did you?

702
00:40:39,557 --> 00:40:41,446
Yes. She sounds fine. Let's go.

703
00:40:41,477 --> 00:40:43,206
What do you hear from Pokey?

704
00:40:43,238 --> 00:40:45,286
Flying. I wonder who's picking up after her,

705
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:46,566
if you're not around.

706
00:40:46,598 --> 00:40:49,830
I've noticed, Mother, since school ended,

707
00:40:49,862 --> 00:40:52,262
Helena looks definitely peaked.

708
00:40:52,293 --> 00:40:53,894
Not from hard work, Daddy.

709
00:40:53,926 --> 00:40:56,454
She needs a change.

710
00:40:56,485 --> 00:40:59,174
We might have all gone to
England, if I didn't need to

711
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,702
keep an eye on the steel market.

712
00:41:01,734 --> 00:41:03,974
But, Helena should go,

713
00:41:04,006 --> 00:41:06,597
perhaps join up with Lakey for the summer.

714
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:09,573
You're not serious, Daddy.

715
00:41:11,237 --> 00:41:13,221
You know I'm all signed up
for the nursery school.

716
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:15,174
That can wait.

717
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:18,502
All dang-fool nonsense, anyway.

718
00:41:18,534 --> 00:41:21,062
With all your education, why you want to

719
00:41:21,093 --> 00:41:24,229
play piano and teach finger painting to a

720
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:25,893
bunch of Yid's kids.

721
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:27,494
From what I've heard... Now, Daddy.

722
00:41:28,517 --> 00:41:30,597
Helena agrees, I'm sure.

723
00:41:34,406 --> 00:41:35,526
It's here.

724
00:41:36,965 --> 00:41:38,054
Polly.

725
00:41:40,518 --> 00:41:42,565
You have a nice summer, you hear?

726
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:45,445
Okay. Goodbye, Helena.

727
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:49,861
Write to me. I will.

728
00:41:49,893 --> 00:41:50,853
Good luck on the job.

729
00:41:50,886 --> 00:41:52,645
Thank you.

730
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,213
Goodbye, Helena.

731
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:57,062
Listen now, you keep the class notes for me.
You know everything.

732
00:41:57,093 --> 00:41:58,341
I will.

733
00:42:00,773 --> 00:42:01,989
Priss.

734
00:42:04,197 --> 00:42:05,381
Have a wonderful time.

735
00:42:05,413 --> 00:42:07,110
Happy wedding to you and
Sloan if I'm not back.

736
00:42:07,141 --> 00:42:08,805
Happy everything. Thank you.

737
00:42:15,173 --> 00:42:18,693
Off to Europe meekly with
her tail between her legs.

738
00:42:18,725 --> 00:42:22,181
The steel tycoon doesn't fancy
nursery school for his only child.

739
00:42:22,213 --> 00:42:23,590
The trip is a bribe.

740
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:25,413
Driver, let me out near Macy's, please.

741
00:42:25,445 --> 00:42:27,782
I got a call. They may start
me earlier than I thought.

742
00:42:27,813 --> 00:42:29,573
Well, Libby, you pay the fare.

743
00:42:29,605 --> 00:42:31,622
You're the only one with money in the crowd.

744
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:38,789
Your best quality in beige, please.

745
00:42:38,821 --> 00:42:40,165
Size seven and a quarter.

746
00:42:40,197 --> 00:42:42,309
Libby, you snoop.

747
00:42:42,341 --> 00:42:43,525
It took me hours to find you.

748
00:42:43,557 --> 00:42:45,029
I thought it was glassware.

749
00:42:45,061 --> 00:42:47,781
We're shifted around, Libby, to
learn every aspect of selling.

750
00:42:47,813 --> 00:42:49,349
How exciting!

751
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:50,789
Come on, please, Libby, go away,

752
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:52,229
they watch trainees like hawks.

753
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:55,749
Size seven and a quarter in beige. Please.

754
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,188
Now, cut it out!

755
00:42:57,221 --> 00:42:59,909
Seriously, I haven't got a thing
to wear to Priss's wedding.

756
00:42:59,941 --> 00:43:01,541
Who has?

757
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:06,565
Let's not be all day, miss.

758
00:43:06,597 --> 00:43:09,541
Shut up, madam.

759
00:43:09,573 --> 00:43:12,389
<i>♪ Joyously open your hearts</i>

760
00:43:12,421 --> 00:43:15,365
<i>♪ We greet this day</i>

761
00:43:15,397 --> 00:43:18,469
<i>♪ Joyously open your hearts</i>

762
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:20,484
<i>♪ We greet this day</i>

763
00:43:27,013 --> 00:43:29,349
What a splash!

764
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,612
Lovely house. I wouldn't
mind something like this.

765
00:43:32,645 --> 00:43:34,501
Polly, I saw a marvelous apartment.

766
00:43:34,532 --> 00:43:37,637
Of course, it's not cheap exactly, I'll
have to break it to Harald gently.

767
00:43:39,173 --> 00:43:41,604
Polly, what's the matter?

768
00:43:41,637 --> 00:43:44,517
Nothing. I'm just very happy for Priss.

769
00:43:45,637 --> 00:43:47,749
Look, I know it's none of my business...

770
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,605
It's all over with Phil, Kay.

771
00:43:49,636 --> 00:43:50,885
I wrote him.

772
00:43:52,005 --> 00:43:54,404
Very upper crusty in there.

773
00:43:54,436 --> 00:43:56,133
Doctor Sloan Crockett's nobody's fool.

774
00:43:56,164 --> 00:43:58,501
What social connections for a practice.

775
00:43:58,532 --> 00:44:00,389
You might like Priss a little, Libby.

776
00:44:00,421 --> 00:44:02,053
Naturally. I didn't mean to imply that...

777
00:44:03,076 --> 00:44:05,220
Hi! What a shindig.

778
00:44:05,252 --> 00:44:07,013
How's Cornell, Pokey?

779
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:09,285
Cute boys. The vet course, silly.

780
00:44:09,317 --> 00:44:10,404
Without Priss to pull you through, That!

781
00:44:10,437 --> 00:44:11,972
Poke, what are you gonna do? Flunk.

782
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:15,108
Girls! Girls, listen to this.

783
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:18,948
This is from Vienna.

784
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:21,892
"Best wishes, dear Priss, with all our love."

785
00:44:21,924 --> 00:44:23,333
"Lakey and Helena."

786
00:44:23,364 --> 00:44:24,612
Isn't that nice?

787
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:27,140
But there's another one.
There's another one.

788
00:44:27,173 --> 00:44:29,380
"Dearest thoughts on this day."

789
00:44:29,412 --> 00:44:31,940
"My prayers for your happiness.
Love, Dottie."

790
00:44:31,973 --> 00:44:33,700
Dottie, prayers. She means it.

791
00:44:33,733 --> 00:44:35,140
Where's my girl?

792
00:44:36,356 --> 00:44:38,244
Little Priss.

793
00:44:39,332 --> 00:44:40,580
Who'd a thunk it?

794
00:44:40,613 --> 00:44:44,644
Imagine little Priss, tonight.

795
00:44:50,756 --> 00:44:52,837
There's so little of you, Priss.

796
00:44:55,365 --> 00:44:57,572
Too little for both Roosevelt and me.

797
00:45:06,084 --> 00:45:07,332
Now, look, all the walls should be white

798
00:45:07,364 --> 00:45:09,124
with really bright colors against them.

799
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:10,948
And we'll have a folding
table in the dinette

800
00:45:10,981 --> 00:45:12,164
and separated from the kitchen

801
00:45:12,196 --> 00:45:14,628
with one of those slatted folding doors.

802
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,932
Look, the latest model stove and icebox.

803
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:26,724
Say something.

804
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,060
How much?

805
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:33,284
$102 and 50 cents a month.

806
00:45:33,315 --> 00:45:36,132
Including gas and electricity.

807
00:45:36,164 --> 00:45:38,372
Harald, look, between us,
we make $400 a month.

808
00:45:38,404 --> 00:45:40,932
This is one-fourth of our income for rent.

809
00:45:40,964 --> 00:45:42,084
With my discount at the store,

810
00:45:42,116 --> 00:45:43,908
we can furnish it for nothing a month.

811
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,460
And we've got years to pay, Harald,
we're not even gonna miss it.

812
00:45:49,891 --> 00:45:52,452
Harald!

813
00:45:52,484 --> 00:45:54,052
Wait till you see the bedroom.

814
00:45:54,083 --> 00:45:55,748
We got the hugest walk-in closet

815
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:58,083
with room to make the darlingest
little dressing room.

816
00:45:58,116 --> 00:45:59,491
Look.

817
00:45:59,524 --> 00:46:01,763
Hold your hat, Libby.
We signed the lease today.

818
00:46:01,796 --> 00:46:02,979
Swell!

819
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:04,164
We could be in, in November

820
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:05,444
but that depends on upholstery.

821
00:46:05,476 --> 00:46:06,500
But the furniture's all picked.

822
00:46:06,532 --> 00:46:07,972
It's blond Swedish.

823
00:46:08,004 --> 00:46:09,988
And a terrific material for the couch,

824
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,323
<i>a sort of a strawberry
red, you've got to see.</i>

825
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:13,443
I can't wait.

826
00:46:13,476 --> 00:46:14,692
Libby, there's no drapery problem,

827
00:46:14,724 --> 00:46:16,004
we've got Venetian blinds.

828
00:46:16,036 --> 00:46:17,302
It's a tremendous saving, really.

829
00:46:17,891 --> 00:46:19,076
Phone, Mrs. Peterson.

830
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:25,380
Yes?

831
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:27,460
Take your time about dinner tonight, love.

832
00:46:27,491 --> 00:46:29,059
<i>Harald, what do you mean?</i>

833
00:46:29,092 --> 00:46:30,467
Harald's joined the unemployed.

834
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,779
The show's closing.

835
00:46:31,812 --> 00:46:33,443
No, Harald was fired.

836
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:35,011
Fired?

837
00:46:35,044 --> 00:46:36,899
Yeah, so don't rush, love.

838
00:46:41,123 --> 00:46:43,971
Kay, the contracts.
Upholstery and furniture.

839
00:46:44,003 --> 00:46:46,883
If you sign now, we'll be able
to start work immediately.

840
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,059
I'm just going to look them
over again, Helen, thank you.

841
00:47:02,532 --> 00:47:04,035
Good evening, my dear.

842
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,619
I'm aware of the bitter
irony behind all this.

843
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:14,979
It seems you've picked a lemon.

844
00:47:15,011 --> 00:47:16,740
What happened, Harald?

845
00:47:19,523 --> 00:47:20,707
Before a drink?

846
00:47:20,739 --> 00:47:21,731
Please!

847
00:47:22,755 --> 00:47:25,411
I was axed by a flibberty gibbet.

848
00:47:27,491 --> 00:47:29,699
The director.

849
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:31,342
Or has it escaped your attention? But why?

850
00:47:33,571 --> 00:47:35,171
I...

851
00:47:35,203 --> 00:47:38,083
I changed his scenes, he alleges.

852
00:47:38,115 --> 00:47:39,971
His lousy direction is more apt. Did you?

853
00:47:43,043 --> 00:47:44,899
Yes.

854
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:47,619
But I mean, when actors start to slip,
somebody's got to pull them up,

855
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:49,891
and the genius was never wrong, so...

856
00:47:53,379 --> 00:47:56,611
So, I changed, meaning
"improved," his direction.

857
00:47:57,699 --> 00:47:59,811
Also he smelled liquor on my breath.

858
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:00,899
Harald.

859
00:48:00,931 --> 00:48:02,019
"Harald" what?

860
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:07,651
A silver fizz?

861
00:48:07,683 --> 00:48:09,371
I don't think I'll have anything, thank you.

862
00:48:12,995 --> 00:48:16,387
You know, you really are the most

863
00:48:16,418 --> 00:48:18,946
tactless blundering fool that ever lived.

864
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,419
What have I said?

865
00:48:20,451 --> 00:48:22,147
"I don't think I'll have
anything, thank you."

866
00:48:22,178 --> 00:48:23,842
Implying in your usual clumsy manner that if

867
00:48:23,875 --> 00:48:25,666
I had not been drinking none of
this would have ever happened.

868
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:27,523
I swear, Harald, but there
was that second and third...

869
00:48:27,555 --> 00:48:29,762
And what an egotist... Darling.

870
00:48:29,795 --> 00:48:33,987
Observe how you shift the center
of the drama to yourself.

871
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:36,803
You see, it was I who was fired.
Honestly, you had nothing to do with it.

872
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:40,003
Harald, all right, please, I
have to look at this recipe.

873
00:48:40,995 --> 00:48:42,690
Well, it won't help.

874
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:47,171
Cooking is a lively art.

875
00:48:47,203 --> 00:48:49,699
You make it rather academic and lifeless.

876
00:48:52,034 --> 00:48:54,243
Well, at least it's not out of a can.

877
00:48:54,914 --> 00:48:57,090
I am sick of cans.

878
00:48:57,123 --> 00:49:00,003
I won't live that way, week in and week out.

879
00:49:00,034 --> 00:49:02,210
Like an animal, just to keep alive.

880
00:49:02,242 --> 00:49:04,482
Fine.

881
00:49:04,514 --> 00:49:07,779
But that's pretty skimpy for four.
You'd better open a can of beans.

882
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:08,962
My God, the Blakes!

883
00:49:10,178 --> 00:49:13,378
Harald, please, call them.

884
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,722
Call her off, say I'm sick.

885
00:49:14,755 --> 00:49:16,898
Why? I'd love to see old Put and Norine.

886
00:49:16,931 --> 00:49:19,490
No budget advice tonight from good old Put.

887
00:49:19,522 --> 00:49:21,827
A miser with a private income.

888
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:24,290
Or the butter versus margarine
debate with Norine.

889
00:49:24,322 --> 00:49:26,658
The same left-wing snob she was at school.

890
00:49:26,691 --> 00:49:29,090
And how she uses the top of the
bottle instead of real cream.

891
00:49:29,122 --> 00:49:30,498
At $40 a month, if possible

892
00:49:30,531 --> 00:49:32,578
and paying rent instead
of 102, that's a real...

893
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:34,690
Forty, yes for a basement. Well,
I won't live in a basement.

894
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:35,746
It's unhealthy.

895
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,810
Anyway, Harald, what's the
point, we've got to go ahead.

896
00:49:39,842 --> 00:49:41,122
The furniture, the materials.

897
00:49:41,154 --> 00:49:42,499
Well, cancel them.

898
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,154
I signed the contracts.

899
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:46,690
When?

900
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:48,962
Two days ago.

901
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:52,802
It's all started, everything's cut.

902
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:56,099
Harald, what about my job? I
have to pay for it anyway.

903
00:50:00,994 --> 00:50:02,211
Harald,

904
00:50:03,682 --> 00:50:05,570
what's all the panic about?

905
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:08,962
You'll be at work in no time.

906
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:12,322
Look, this is a Godsend.

907
00:50:12,354 --> 00:50:15,298
Well, you shouldn't even take another job.

908
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:18,050
Why not go back to work on the play?

909
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:20,162
You've got one act of it already.

910
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:23,778
And, with my salary and

911
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:26,082
the wedding money Dad sent,
we're all right for months.

912
00:50:30,754 --> 00:50:33,346
Hi, Norine. How are you?

913
00:50:35,938 --> 00:50:37,922
Harald's got the sack.

914
00:50:37,954 --> 00:50:40,386
Harald, wait till they've
got their things off.

915
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:42,337
Now, start from the beginning
and don't leave anything out.

916
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:44,162
And, tell it just the way you told me.

917
00:50:44,194 --> 00:50:46,114
It's beans, Norine, beans.

918
00:50:49,538 --> 00:50:51,010
Isn't Lakey ever coming home?

919
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:52,545
Listen, tell me.

920
00:50:52,578 --> 00:50:55,586
Well. I'm still at the grind,
doing brilliantly, of course.

921
00:50:55,618 --> 00:50:58,082
How's Kay? That's a story.

922
00:50:58,114 --> 00:50:59,202
Well, she sends her love, by the way,

923
00:50:59,234 --> 00:51:00,386
she'll come to the hotel, right after work.

924
00:51:00,418 --> 00:51:02,018
I'm afraid not, Libby, I
have to go straight home

925
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:03,361
to Cleveland, Mother's in bed with the flu.

926
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,090
Helena.

927
00:51:05,121 --> 00:51:06,882
What did you mean, a story about Kay?

928
00:51:06,914 --> 00:51:09,346
Well, Harald was fired.

929
00:51:09,377 --> 00:51:11,489
Hasn't worked in months,
now he's writing a play.

930
00:51:11,522 --> 00:51:13,698
I mean, how they're managing
is a complete mystery.

931
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:14,977
Kay had to have her modern apartment.

932
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:17,505
She looks a wreck. Dottie's still out West.

933
00:51:17,538 --> 00:51:20,002
Something's cooking out there, I know it.

934
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:21,441
Poke flunked the first quarter at Cornell.

935
00:51:21,474 --> 00:51:24,641
Of course, but very gay, it's
perfectly normal, she says.

936
00:51:24,673 --> 00:51:26,209
How's Polly? Polly's fine.

937
00:51:26,241 --> 00:51:27,682
The Phil thing's definitely off.

938
00:51:27,713 --> 00:51:29,346
And nobody else? Yeah.

939
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:30,566
You know, the trouble with Polly,

940
00:51:30,593 --> 00:51:32,482
she's marvelous company
when you're alone with her,

941
00:51:32,513 --> 00:51:34,402
but, she just doesn't shine at gatherings.

942
00:51:35,553 --> 00:51:37,121
Priss is pregnant. No!

943
00:51:37,153 --> 00:51:38,785
Sloan sure had to work fast.

944
00:51:38,818 --> 00:51:40,801
One way to get her out of Roosevelt's hands.

945
00:52:14,082 --> 00:52:15,585
To Harald's play,

946
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:18,305
and you better do right by it, Mr. Bergler.

947
00:52:18,337 --> 00:52:21,569
The option money saved them. Kay was
about to have her phone yanked.

948
00:52:21,601 --> 00:52:24,545
Read the Communist Manifesto for its style.

949
00:52:24,577 --> 00:52:27,361
It's just an inner spring
box with a mattress on top.

950
00:52:27,393 --> 00:52:30,689
Really, look, Harald put pegs on the
bottom to keep it off the floor.

951
00:52:30,721 --> 00:52:33,761
Pokey's flying outfit. Her
plane must be double-parked.

952
00:52:33,793 --> 00:52:34,977
Who's the Navy man?

953
00:52:35,009 --> 00:52:36,321
A bar friend of Harald's.

954
00:52:37,569 --> 00:52:39,713
Say, is that actor's hair natural?

955
00:52:40,801 --> 00:52:42,817
I told Harald when he read it to me.

956
00:52:42,849 --> 00:52:45,185
The line of the play is sheer toboggan.

957
00:52:45,217 --> 00:52:46,721
Four mink coats in the bedroom. Four!

958
00:52:46,753 --> 00:52:48,865
One hell of a party. A hell of a party.

959
00:52:48,897 --> 00:52:51,361
He's on the bottle worse than ever.

960
00:52:51,393 --> 00:52:53,409
Listen, what can Dottie be thinking of?

961
00:52:53,441 --> 00:52:55,041
A widower and 39.

962
00:52:56,097 --> 00:52:58,241
I was just thinking,

963
00:52:58,273 --> 00:53:00,545
everyone's here except Lakey.

964
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:01,889
How marvelous.

965
00:53:03,552 --> 00:53:05,281
Come on, let's join the party.

966
00:53:05,313 --> 00:53:09,057
Why do rich people give
money to labor? Guilt.

967
00:53:09,089 --> 00:53:11,937
Crops out in the second
generation in such families.

968
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:13,345
How do we get out of here?

969
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:15,361
Behave yourself, Poke.

970
00:53:20,736 --> 00:53:23,457
Now, who could that be? As if I didn't know.

971
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:26,977
Hey, Sam to the rescue. Hi.

972
00:53:28,129 --> 00:53:29,825
Put it on the bill, Sam.

973
00:53:29,857 --> 00:53:32,577
Shot in the arm for a
slightly lagging party.

974
00:53:32,608 --> 00:53:34,849
Harald, how can you say that?

975
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,417
Mr. Bergler, have you got
everything you need?

976
00:53:36,448 --> 00:53:40,385
Living in Arizona, won't you miss
the concerts and theater, Dottie?

977
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,464
No, there are

978
00:53:42,497 --> 00:53:45,184
many things out there, many
interesting people, artists.

979
00:53:45,217 --> 00:53:46,721
- All right.
- Your ideal contributor.

980
00:53:46,752 --> 00:53:48,865
Heir to a fortune.

981
00:53:48,897 --> 00:53:52,129
Well, take you, daughter of steel tycoon.

982
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,721
Your family, Kay tells,
lives on the income of...

983
00:53:54,752 --> 00:53:56,481
Now, here is a girl who might have had

984
00:53:56,512 --> 00:53:57,920
a real career in the theater.

985
00:53:57,953 --> 00:53:59,617
Well, too many talents is her trouble.

986
00:53:59,648 --> 00:54:02,049
You know, she writes, sings,
paints, dances, plays,

987
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,488
I don't know how many instruments?

988
00:54:03,521 --> 00:54:04,929
Forgot bird calls.

989
00:54:07,232 --> 00:54:09,344
Rooster bird.

990
00:54:09,377 --> 00:54:12,480
Sorry, Kay, but we're overdue
at a family gathering.

991
00:54:12,513 --> 00:54:14,720
No, no, please, Harald
fixed up all the chili.

992
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,001
I'll push off too, Kay.

993
00:54:16,032 --> 00:54:17,057
Wait a minute.

994
00:54:17,088 --> 00:54:18,208
The chili?

995
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,520
Well, that'll keep for months.

996
00:54:19,552 --> 00:54:20,768
I have to go too, Kay.

997
00:54:20,801 --> 00:54:22,688
Shall we get our coats, dear.

998
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:26,305
It's not that so much, Harald was
going to read one act of his play.

999
00:54:26,336 --> 00:54:28,416
That'll keep for years.

1000
00:54:28,448 --> 00:54:30,336
This is terrible.

1001
00:54:30,368 --> 00:54:32,929
Picture of a party laying an egg.

1002
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,616
Goodnight, Harald, thank you
so much for having us over.

1003
00:54:35,649 --> 00:54:36,704
We had a lovely time.

1004
00:54:36,736 --> 00:54:37,888
Should have been a course,

1005
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,064
on how to project at
public gatherings, girls.

1006
00:54:40,097 --> 00:54:41,888
See you tomorrow, Harald. See
you another time very soon.

1007
00:54:41,921 --> 00:54:43,200
Paul.

1008
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:47,904
A lovely party, Kay.

1009
00:54:47,937 --> 00:54:49,184
I do wish you wouldn't leave so soon?

1010
00:54:49,216 --> 00:54:51,040
The party's just beginning.
Sorry, dear, but I must go.

1011
00:54:51,072 --> 00:54:52,640
I'll see you on Monday, thank you.
Yes, goodnight.

1012
00:54:52,672 --> 00:54:53,632
Goodnight.

1013
00:54:54,688 --> 00:54:56,000
Two mink coats down

1014
00:54:56,032 --> 00:54:57,760
and two to go. Harald!

1015
00:54:57,792 --> 00:55:00,896
All right, all right, I'll
heat up the mess. All right!

1016
00:55:02,337 --> 00:55:05,376
Please, sit down, everybody.

1017
00:55:05,408 --> 00:55:07,680
I just won't hear of anyone else going.

1018
00:55:07,712 --> 00:55:10,400
If you want drinks, just help yourselves.

1019
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,928
Helena, I'm so glad you came.

1020
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,544
You can't be serious about courses
in etching and acrobatic dancing.

1021
00:55:16,576 --> 00:55:18,944
You know, you've got to make
an effort to get a job.

1022
00:55:18,976 --> 00:55:20,544
Harald, should I make the coffee?

1023
00:55:20,576 --> 00:55:22,304
No, entertain your guests.

1024
00:55:22,336 --> 00:55:23,616
Let me do it. I'll do it,

1025
00:55:23,648 --> 00:55:24,896
I know where everything is.

1026
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:30,240
She'll make the coffee too weak,
then she'll use paper napkins.

1027
00:55:30,272 --> 00:55:31,616
Forget it, Kay.

1028
00:55:31,648 --> 00:55:33,728
Loved your rooster. Give
me a light, would you?

1029
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:39,679
I'll get the kitchen light.

1030
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:42,176
No, Kay, Kay. I'll get them, I'll get them.

1031
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,359
Did you find them? Gangway.

1032
00:55:47,392 --> 00:55:49,024
Harald, give her the kitchen matches?

1033
00:55:49,056 --> 00:55:51,455
You can't leave now.

1034
00:55:51,488 --> 00:55:55,424
Now, please, please, everybody, we've
got to make Harald read his play.

1035
00:55:55,456 --> 00:55:57,344
I insist on it, Dave.

1036
00:55:57,376 --> 00:55:59,456
You too, Bill. I must.

1037
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,768
Paper napkins.

1038
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:05,888
Chili.

1039
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,840
Dottie, Priss, come on, help me.

1040
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:10,176
Ask him, Bill.

1041
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:12,544
How about it, Harald?

1042
00:56:12,575 --> 00:56:15,040
A bit of that great play, sheepskin,

1043
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:16,544
for a clamoring public.

1044
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,936
Or, maybe, a better title would be,

1045
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,008
"The Fall of a Just Man."

1046
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,440
Call it what you like. Is it a play?

1047
00:56:25,471 --> 00:56:27,008
Bill!

1048
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:31,040
Is it a second-rate actor's idea of a play?

1049
00:56:31,071 --> 00:56:32,320
Is that it?

1050
00:56:32,352 --> 00:56:34,944
Give an actor a man, not a phony symbol.

1051
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,760
What are you talking about, Bill?

1052
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:39,967
If you want to write about your father,

1053
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,784
why not the poor Norwegian immigrant
who taught manual training

1054
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,479
at Boise High School,

1055
00:56:44,511 --> 00:56:48,640
who got kicked around by a lousy Vice
Principal because he was what he was.

1056
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,975
What's this college president?

1057
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:54,719
Politicians put the skids under
him and he shoots to the bottom.

1058
00:56:54,752 --> 00:56:56,799
Why glorify your old man?

1059
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,559
Or is the point to glorify yourself.

1060
00:56:58,592 --> 00:56:59,871
That's absurd, Bill.

1061
00:57:02,015 --> 00:57:03,519
No, I don't think so.

1062
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,351
That was very interesting, Bill.

1063
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:12,447
That was very interesting.

1064
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:17,440
Is it a play?

1065
00:57:20,191 --> 00:57:22,431
Is it a play? That's the question.

1066
00:57:25,407 --> 00:57:27,040
No, it's not a play.

1067
00:57:27,071 --> 00:57:28,608
Just a little work, but it's not a play

1068
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:30,847
till I say down the incinerator with it.

1069
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,223
Now, Harald, cut it out.

1070
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,879
No, no, no.

1071
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,439
I was. I was kidding.

1072
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,679
Come on.

1073
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,239
Harald!

1074
00:57:55,775 --> 00:57:58,687
His producer has a copy and
his agent has about 20.

1075
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,431
Anyone for chili?

1076
00:58:08,895 --> 00:58:10,687
You needn't have bothered to phone, Norine.

1077
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:12,767
No?

1078
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,943
It's not likely I'd tell Kay.

1079
00:58:14,975 --> 00:58:17,087
I wouldn't want to wreck her marriage.

1080
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,527
Neither would I.

1081
00:58:19,294 --> 00:58:20,479
Then don't.

1082
00:58:21,566 --> 00:58:23,998
Well, it's not quite that simple.

1083
00:58:24,031 --> 00:58:27,903
You see, Harald and I have been
lovers for quite some time.

1084
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:32,095
It may surprise you to know that I'm
not the first, since he was married.

1085
00:58:32,126 --> 00:58:34,814
But when this began, we both agreed we
wouldn't let it affect our marriages...

1086
00:58:34,847 --> 00:58:36,799
Easier said than done, isn't it?

1087
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:39,198
Well, no, not for me, exactly.

1088
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:43,967
You see, my husband isn't
quite the man he looks.

1089
00:58:43,998 --> 00:58:46,143
A lot my mother ever told me.

1090
00:58:46,174 --> 00:58:48,575
She hates sex like most of her generation.

1091
00:58:48,606 --> 00:58:51,263
I was completely innocent
when we were married.

1092
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:54,302
So, there we were in this crummy hotel room,

1093
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,446
necking away until we both
got pretty excited...

1094
00:58:56,478 --> 00:58:58,046
Why Harald?

1095
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,135
Envy.

1096
00:59:00,511 --> 00:59:01,919
The tower group.

1097
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:04,287
Kay, in particular.

1098
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:08,479
You never liked me at school, Helena.

1099
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:10,846
None of your crowd did.

1100
00:59:10,878 --> 00:59:12,702
We eyed each other across the barricade,

1101
00:59:12,735 --> 00:59:15,934
you were the aesthetes,
and we were the politicals.

1102
00:59:15,967 --> 00:59:19,359
The whole class voted for
Roosevelt in the college poll.

1103
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,406
Except Pokey, who forgot to vote.

1104
00:59:21,438 --> 00:59:23,518
Anyway, how I used to envy you.

1105
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:27,295
The ivory tower, we called it.

1106
00:59:27,326 --> 00:59:30,078
Poise, social savvy.

1107
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:32,799
Social savvy? In Kay's
background, for instance?

1108
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,798
It was something else about Kay.

1109
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,934
Being "Tower," she could stay
at Harald's place on weekends,

1110
00:59:39,966 --> 00:59:42,078
without becoming <i>declasse.</i>

1111
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:44,702
She could get away with it.

1112
00:59:44,734 --> 00:59:47,358
But, anyone in my crowd try it...

1113
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:51,039
Look, Norine, I may not
be political, as you say.

1114
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:53,758
Whatever I believed, I try
first, to be an honest person.

1115
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:56,734
Well, go on, Helena, tell me some more.

1116
00:59:56,766 --> 00:59:58,302
I'd stop seeing Harald.

1117
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:01,182
In your case, I'd

1118
01:00:01,214 --> 01:00:03,422
get a divorce or an annulment.

1119
01:00:03,454 --> 01:00:05,918
If you want to stay with
your husband, then I...

1120
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:09,246
I think you should decide to do without sex.

1121
01:00:09,278 --> 01:00:11,486
You say it very casually, Helena.

1122
01:00:12,126 --> 01:00:14,366
Do without sex.

1123
01:00:14,398 --> 01:00:17,246
Lots of women do and thrive on it.

1124
01:00:17,278 --> 01:00:20,286
Our teachers at college, for instance,
they weren't dried up or sour.

1125
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:21,726
Or you, Helena.

1126
01:00:23,294 --> 01:00:26,398
Do you know what your friend
Kay used to say about you?

1127
01:00:27,614 --> 01:00:29,054
That you are a neuter.

1128
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:31,934
Like a mule.

1129
01:00:36,446 --> 01:00:37,854
I've heard that.

1130
01:00:38,589 --> 01:00:39,710
Thanks.

1131
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:42,270
Helena.

1132
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:45,565
You won't repeat what I've told you?

1133
01:00:45,598 --> 01:00:47,485
No. But you will.

1134
01:00:52,958 --> 01:00:54,846
Clean bill of health, Mother.

1135
01:00:58,045 --> 01:01:00,286
Did Dr. Perry say anything
about birth control?

1136
01:01:00,317 --> 01:01:02,974
I'm afraid I stopped him, Mother.

1137
01:01:03,005 --> 01:01:05,086
Dr. Perry can be pretty brusque.

1138
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:09,854
Would you rather see a
woman doctor in New York?

1139
01:01:09,886 --> 01:01:12,894
It isn't legal in Massachusetts.

1140
01:01:12,926 --> 01:01:14,942
I'll go along if you need moral
support or you could ask

1141
01:01:14,973 --> 01:01:17,245
one of the married girls, Priss or Kay?

1142
01:01:24,669 --> 01:01:26,205
I love him, Mother.

1143
01:01:30,589 --> 01:01:32,798
I don't mean Brook.

1144
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:36,157
Then, what happened?

1145
01:01:39,774 --> 01:01:40,733
I...

1146
01:01:43,614 --> 01:01:47,677
I sat for five hours on a bench
in the park waiting for him.

1147
01:01:50,493 --> 01:01:52,733
With that thing in my lap. And...

1148
01:01:56,509 --> 01:01:58,333
And then, I...

1149
01:01:58,366 --> 01:02:02,429
I realized that he didn't
care for me at all.

1150
01:02:05,469 --> 01:02:08,253
So, I left the whole
caboodle under the bench.

1151
01:02:10,749 --> 01:02:13,629
Imagine the junkman's surprise.

1152
01:02:15,038 --> 01:02:18,045
Dottie, perhaps we should
postpone the wedding.

1153
01:02:18,077 --> 01:02:19,517
Why, no.

1154
01:02:19,549 --> 01:02:21,661
But it's cruel, isn't it?

1155
01:02:21,693 --> 01:02:24,797
To marry Brook, an older man.

1156
01:02:24,829 --> 01:02:26,402
What's more, if you only half love him...

1157
01:02:26,429 --> 01:02:28,157
Mother, please.

1158
01:02:28,189 --> 01:02:32,413
In my day, if a woman loved a
man, she would live with him

1159
01:02:32,445 --> 01:02:33,917
and try and reform him. Well...

1160
01:02:35,005 --> 01:02:37,213
You sit on a park bench with a

1161
01:02:39,037 --> 01:02:40,445
whatnot in your lap.

1162
01:02:40,477 --> 01:02:42,717
Sacrifice is dated, Mother.

1163
01:02:42,749 --> 01:02:45,885
You don't reform a man.
He just drags you down.

1164
01:02:45,917 --> 01:02:48,733
I was only going by what you said, Dottie.

1165
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,229
That you loved him. I don't believe you do.

1166
01:02:52,957 --> 01:02:54,973
I think you only like to say so.

1167
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:03,933
Everything arranged for Boston,
and suddenly it's Arizona.

1168
01:03:03,965 --> 01:03:06,237
Now girls, there's more
here than meets the eye.

1169
01:03:06,269 --> 01:03:08,797
What have you heard? Not a thing.

1170
01:03:08,829 --> 01:03:10,685
What about the play case,
is the date set yet?

1171
01:03:10,717 --> 01:03:14,045
Any minute. There are casting
talks, script changes.

1172
01:03:14,077 --> 01:03:15,517
Now, Harald gets home at all hours.

1173
01:03:15,549 --> 01:03:17,852
No real trouble, I hope.

1174
01:03:17,885 --> 01:03:19,516
No. Just theater trouble.

1175
01:03:19,549 --> 01:03:22,813
How about you, Libby, getting
anywhere with your attractive boss?

1176
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:26,173
Gus Leroy? Well, I'm biding my time there.

1177
01:03:26,205 --> 01:03:28,541
He still pictures me living in a garret.

1178
01:03:28,573 --> 01:03:32,381
Confidentially, a Yale music
grad just walked into my life.

1179
01:03:32,412 --> 01:03:35,292
A Jazz fiend. And I think
I'm losing my head.

1180
01:03:35,325 --> 01:03:37,437
He's a beauteous young man.

1181
01:03:37,469 --> 01:03:39,805
Frankly, it's all I can do
to keep my hands off him.

1182
01:04:05,629 --> 01:04:09,565
All is not lost, Priss. As Helena
says, "On to bigger things."

1183
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:13,884
Yes. Much bigger, Polly.

1184
01:04:15,356 --> 01:04:17,661
I'm pregnant again.

1185
01:04:17,692 --> 01:04:20,381
Poor Priss. I do hope
she hangs on to this one.

1186
01:04:20,412 --> 01:04:23,292
Sloan's so busy with his practice,
I wonder where he finds the time.

1187
01:04:23,325 --> 01:04:26,364
Hey, Libby, listen, I'm a grass widow
these days. How about a movie tonight?

1188
01:04:26,397 --> 01:04:29,852
Impossible, Kay. I'll be hours getting
a picnic basket ready for the morning.

1189
01:04:29,885 --> 01:04:31,132
<i>A what?</i>

1190
01:04:31,164 --> 01:04:34,204
A romantic Sunday outing,
dear, in Pelham Bay Park.

1191
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:35,676
The Jazz fiend.

1192
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:38,173
Jazz? My God, haven't
we talked since that...

1193
01:04:38,204 --> 01:04:39,580
No, this one's the darlingest boy.

1194
01:04:39,612 --> 01:04:41,052
I met him at the Berkshire skiing trip.

1195
01:04:41,084 --> 01:04:43,324
English prof at a snazzy private school.

1196
01:04:43,356 --> 01:04:46,365
We have poetry in common,
no less. Soul mates.

1197
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:49,148
Yeah, but don't misunderstand,
he's all man, my dear.

1198
01:05:12,764 --> 01:05:16,220
Guess who Pokey's Princeton flame is?
A poet.

1199
01:05:16,252 --> 01:05:18,140
A distant cousin, I hear.

1200
01:05:18,172 --> 01:05:22,620
Well, the poor branch I suppose, struggling
along on a million-dollar trust fund.

1201
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:25,820
I got a card from Lakey, taking
a doctorate at the Sorbonne.

1202
01:05:25,852 --> 01:05:27,164
The girl's never coming home.

1203
01:05:27,195 --> 01:05:28,476
<i>Dr. Lee.</i>

1204
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,692
Good day, Miss Andrews.

1205
01:05:29,724 --> 01:05:31,452
Hello, Doctor.

1206
01:05:32,636 --> 01:05:34,844
Very nice. I think.

1207
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:35,900
No.

1208
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,180
Nothing cooking?

1209
01:05:37,212 --> 01:05:38,363
No.

1210
01:05:38,396 --> 01:05:41,532
Polly, what's gonna become of you?

1211
01:05:41,564 --> 01:05:43,484
Not even an innocent date now and then?

1212
01:05:43,515 --> 01:05:46,012
Innocent necking party you mean, Libby?

1213
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:50,620
Well, anything. You use men to meet
other men. Polly, I have to hurry.

1214
01:05:50,652 --> 01:05:53,916
Very important appointment with Leroy
at 2:00. And I'm miles from the office.

1215
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:56,603
That was a blow.

1216
01:05:56,636 --> 01:05:59,932
Gus Leroy married. A
two-year-old boy, no less.

1217
01:05:59,964 --> 01:06:04,060
Wife's a Party member I hear.
And he's plenty pink.

1218
01:06:04,091 --> 01:06:06,300
New masses on his desk, and with
the Spain ruckus in the air,

1219
01:06:06,332 --> 01:06:08,379
more proletary literature.

1220
01:06:08,412 --> 01:06:13,212
But like or lump it, some of our best
authors are Communists this year.

1221
01:06:13,244 --> 01:06:15,451
The first night I'm free,
we'll see a movie, Polly.

1222
01:06:15,484 --> 01:06:18,043
You know my nights are a terrible problem.

1223
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:21,659
You have real writing talent.
And plenty of drive.

1224
01:06:21,692 --> 01:06:26,971
But you just don't have the knack for
picking out a publishable manuscript.

1225
01:06:27,004 --> 01:06:30,299
Have you ever thought of a
job with a literary agency?

1226
01:06:30,332 --> 01:06:33,435
I mean, you tell me that you
like to work with writers.

1227
01:06:33,468 --> 01:06:35,132
Well, that's what the agents do.

1228
01:06:35,163 --> 01:06:40,411
It just comes down to this, we have no
work you're uniquely qualified to do.

1229
01:06:40,444 --> 01:06:44,315
You're one of the thousands of English
majors to come pouring out of the colleges

1230
01:06:44,347 --> 01:06:47,131
every June stage-struck
to go into publishing.

1231
01:06:48,411 --> 01:06:50,044
You're more persevering, of course,

1232
01:06:50,075 --> 01:06:52,699
and you do have some eerie
relation to literature,

1233
01:06:52,732 --> 01:06:54,875
but, I wish you luck...

1234
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:02,299
Miss MacAusland. For heaven's
sakes, Miss MacAusland.

1235
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:04,700
Hey. Listen, are you... What?

1236
01:07:04,731 --> 01:07:07,611
Hey! Miss Brooks, some water. What...

1237
01:07:07,643 --> 01:07:10,939
What is it? What happened? How are you?

1238
01:07:10,972 --> 01:07:13,371
Now listen, I bet you didn't
have any lunch, did you?

1239
01:07:13,403 --> 01:07:17,019
Look, I want you to... I want you to
get something to eat, you understand?

1240
01:07:17,051 --> 01:07:20,059
And you take a taxi home. And
listen, Miss MacAusland,

1241
01:07:20,091 --> 01:07:23,675
don't you worry about that job, I
think I know just the spot for you.

1242
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:25,372
Working close to Mr. Jones himself,

1243
01:07:25,403 --> 01:07:27,963
with the snazzy salary of 25 a week.

1244
01:07:27,995 --> 01:07:31,195
Reading the stuff of established authors
no less. And lunching with him, Kay.

1245
01:07:31,227 --> 01:07:33,019
Well, the Algonquin, on expense account.

1246
01:07:34,587 --> 01:07:37,275
<i>It'll be Faulkner any day.
I'm at powwows with editors,</i>

1247
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:39,515
with Gus Leroy, who knows.

1248
01:07:39,547 --> 01:07:41,275
He and I are the best
of friends, by the way,

1249
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:42,765
even though I did walk out on the job.

1250
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:51,675
Well, we can't have this again, Priss.

1251
01:07:51,707 --> 01:07:54,426
Worst possible advertisement
for a pediatrician.

1252
01:08:25,146 --> 01:08:27,131
What kept you so late, Harald?

1253
01:08:32,795 --> 01:08:33,883
Kept me?

1254
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:38,427
I was collecting notes for the...

1255
01:08:39,675 --> 01:08:41,882
For the alumni rag.

1256
01:08:41,915 --> 01:08:43,706
I gotta do it for Helena.

1257
01:08:46,842 --> 01:08:49,851
The play is off. Bergler's
dropped the option.

1258
01:08:54,747 --> 01:08:55,803
Boy.

1259
01:08:58,362 --> 01:09:00,282
You said he liked the last rewrite.

1260
01:09:00,314 --> 01:09:03,066
Yeah. So he said.

1261
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:06,875
Then why?

1262
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:10,811
Well, what's the difference?
What's the use of postmortem?

1263
01:09:12,794 --> 01:09:15,034
Harald, if something goes
wrong even at the store,

1264
01:09:15,066 --> 01:09:17,242
we sit down and try to
trace the cause of this.

1265
01:09:17,275 --> 01:09:20,667
For God's sakes, keep your petty
<i>bourgeois</i> standards out of my affairs.

1266
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:26,331
What are you doing?

1267
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:30,011
Well, Bergler's a decent man, he's got a

1268
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:34,938
show on the road. He said, I can join,

1269
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:37,274
as second or third assistant.
Something or the other, I don't know.

1270
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:38,842
You're not serious?

1271
01:09:41,562 --> 01:09:44,762
Well, what do you suggest? I retire
on your promotion at Macy's?

1272
01:09:46,714 --> 01:09:47,994
For how long?

1273
01:09:49,306 --> 01:09:51,035
Four months, six months.

1274
01:09:52,442 --> 01:09:54,010
The longer, the better.

1275
01:09:56,762 --> 01:09:58,362
Come on.

1276
01:09:59,386 --> 01:10:01,434
Don't worry.

1277
01:10:01,466 --> 01:10:06,234
I'll send home money every week to pay
for this blonde Swedish showroom.

1278
01:10:10,202 --> 01:10:13,434
<i>♪ Come, come, ye daughters of the arts</i>

1279
01:10:13,466 --> 01:10:16,634
<i>♪ Come, come this day</i>

1280
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:19,738

01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:22,874

<i>♪ To celebrate, to celebrate ♪</i>

1286
01:10:43,514 --> 01:10:46,042
Polly, leave those. Ida will
do all that in the morning.

1287
01:10:46,074 --> 01:10:48,122
You go right back inside.

1288
01:10:48,154 --> 01:10:51,002
Mrs. Peterson will get those, Ida.
You fill the punch bowl please.

1289
01:10:51,034 --> 01:10:52,889
Polly, please go back in.

1290
01:10:52,922 --> 01:10:54,553
I've about had it, Libby.

1291
01:10:54,586 --> 01:10:57,178
With all those brilliant people
in there, don't tell me?

1292
01:10:57,210 --> 01:11:00,250
I did see you talking to Gus Leroy.
I never thought he'd come.

1293
01:11:00,282 --> 01:11:02,041
Or rather he was talking to you.

1294
01:11:02,074 --> 01:11:03,770
What did he say? Anything about me?

1295
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,690
No. Just seemed to want to talk.

1296
01:11:05,721 --> 01:11:07,578
He's lonely, poor man.

1297
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:09,402
Separated from that monster
of a wife, you know.

1298
01:11:09,434 --> 01:11:11,993
There you are, Elizabeth. Nils!

1299
01:11:12,026 --> 01:11:16,058
Back to the guests please. Out
of the kitchen, <i>Herr</i> Baron.

1300
01:11:16,089 --> 01:11:18,042
Now, that's a dear boy.

1301
01:11:20,602 --> 01:11:24,090
What a man! That figure,
those heavenly manners.

1302
01:11:24,121 --> 01:11:25,785
Are you sure you're not exposed, dear?

1303
01:11:26,553 --> 01:11:28,250
The dress shrunk, I think.

1304
01:11:28,282 --> 01:11:30,618
Or you developed.

1305
01:11:30,649 --> 01:11:33,242
Kate, dear, get the <i>hors d'oeuvres</i>
out of the oven like an angel.

1306
01:11:33,273 --> 01:11:37,434
Now, go on, Polly. There's a lovely
man from the Metropolitan Museum.

1307
01:11:37,465 --> 01:11:39,129
Authority on Tintoretto.

1308
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:42,681
Lakey knows him. Perfect opening.
Now, do as I tell you.

1309
01:11:44,441 --> 01:11:47,994
That Polly. She always leaves early unless
you give her something useful to do.

1310
01:11:48,025 --> 01:11:50,201
Like talking to the worst bore in the room.

1311
01:11:50,233 --> 01:11:53,433
She'll be in any minute saying "I'm
afraid I must make my excuses, Libby."

1312
01:11:53,465 --> 01:11:54,777
What do you think of the gathering?

1313
01:11:54,809 --> 01:11:57,817
A bit of publishing, a bit of
theater, a bit of Wall Street,

1314
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:00,793
and my Norwegian Baron. Isn't he divine?

1315
01:12:00,825 --> 01:12:05,209
Kay, when I look at that man, I feel my
knees knocking. You saved my life today.

1316
01:12:05,241 --> 01:12:06,490
I thought Priss was coming.

1317
01:12:06,521 --> 01:12:10,617
I didn't want to say in front
of Polly, she'll worry.

1318
01:12:10,649 --> 01:12:13,817
But Priss took to her bed yesterday.

1319
01:12:13,849 --> 01:12:17,817
That way again. That Sloan is
ruthless, he'll kill the poor girl.

1320
01:12:17,849 --> 01:12:21,881
Well, let's pray. Helena is taking a
studio in New York, she wrote Priss.

1321
01:12:21,913 --> 01:12:23,833
Anything to postpone a job.

1322
01:12:23,865 --> 01:12:26,393
Speaking of jobs, what news from Harald?

1323
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,217
They're in Detroit this week.

1324
01:12:28,249 --> 01:12:30,233
Being near the theater again
has been a shot in the arm.

1325
01:12:30,265 --> 01:12:31,897
In fact, he has a new idea for a play.

1326
01:12:31,929 --> 01:12:33,689
How marvelous.

1327
01:12:34,905 --> 01:12:37,529
I'm afraid I must make my excuses, Libby.

1328
01:12:37,561 --> 01:12:39,961
Polly, not really.

1329
01:12:39,993 --> 01:12:43,097
Could I have a little of the
punch for Mr. Schneider?

1330
01:12:43,129 --> 01:12:44,569
Mr. Schneider?

1331
01:12:44,601 --> 01:12:45,753
An empty cream bottle will do.

1332
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:50,521
You're mad. On that jiggly
bus, it'll spill all over.

1333
01:12:50,553 --> 01:12:53,273
I'm taking her home in a
taxi, Miss MacAusland.

1334
01:12:55,129 --> 01:12:57,049
And so, help me.

1335
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,897
When she fainted, Miss Andrews, I
thought the girl was starving.

1336
01:12:59,929 --> 01:13:03,961
It seems the MacAuslands are among
the powers that be in Pittsfield.

1337
01:13:03,993 --> 01:13:05,913
They own one of the principal mills.

1338
01:13:05,945 --> 01:13:07,609
My family live very near.

1339
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,233
They mill owners, too?

1340
01:13:10,264 --> 01:13:12,409
No, my father was an architect.

1341
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:16,121
But he never built anything
except for relations.

1342
01:13:16,153 --> 01:13:18,361
He lived on his investments till the crash.

1343
01:13:18,393 --> 01:13:19,641
And now?

1344
01:13:19,672 --> 01:13:21,913
We have a farm that we work.

1345
01:13:21,944 --> 01:13:23,833
They work.

1346
01:13:23,864 --> 01:13:27,289
And you, a lab technician, that
what you always wanted to do?

1347
01:13:27,321 --> 01:13:29,528
No, I set out to be a doctor.

1348
01:13:29,561 --> 01:13:31,001
That crash again.

1349
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:33,112
I did my last year on a scholarship.

1350
01:13:33,145 --> 01:13:35,032
Too late now?

1351
01:13:35,065 --> 01:13:37,560
Not if I had Libby's drive,
I suppose, or Kay's.

1352
01:13:37,593 --> 01:13:39,576
You think you haven't?

1353
01:13:39,609 --> 01:13:42,200
It's worse. I never particularly cared

1354
01:13:42,233 --> 01:13:44,089
for people with drive in college.

1355
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,160
Or those most likely to succeed.

1356
01:13:47,193 --> 01:13:48,761
The truth is, the only way

1357
01:13:48,793 --> 01:13:52,345
I could like assured, aggressive
girls is to feel sorry for them.

1358
01:13:56,185 --> 01:13:59,161
A wild success it was, my dear.

1359
01:13:59,192 --> 01:14:01,720
It's so late. You must
be starving, poor man.

1360
01:14:01,752 --> 01:14:04,248
I'll get my wrap, Nils. Not yet, Elizabeth.

1361
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,168
Come. Sit down.

1362
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,904
You must be tired.

1363
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,169
Let us relax a moment.

1364
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,112
Nils.

1365
01:14:21,145 --> 01:14:24,056
Why do you let them call you
that horrible nickname?

1366
01:14:24,088 --> 01:14:25,849
You don't like Libby?

1367
01:14:26,744 --> 01:14:28,248
I like Elizabeth.

1368
01:14:29,304 --> 01:14:30,968
I like her very much.

1369
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,360
Too much.

1370
01:14:39,993 --> 01:14:42,521
Shall we go, Nils?

1371
01:14:42,552 --> 01:14:44,728
Lovely rippling muscles.

1372
01:14:46,969 --> 01:14:49,752
You're a strong girl, aren't you?

1373
01:14:49,784 --> 01:14:51,896
Well, I was varsity basketball center.

1374
01:14:51,928 --> 01:14:52,952
Yes?

1375
01:14:58,392 --> 01:15:00,600
Nils, you irresistible man.

1376
01:15:00,632 --> 01:15:02,648
But really, Nils, we really must go.

1377
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,632
One more kiss, Elizabeth.

1378
01:15:10,712 --> 01:15:12,120
No, Nils.

1379
01:15:12,152 --> 01:15:14,072
Ice maiden, kiss me.

1380
01:15:15,032 --> 01:15:16,952
Not that way. A kiss.

1381
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:23,032
No, Nils, please. No!

1382
01:15:23,064 --> 01:15:25,176
No!

1383
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:27,768
Nils, that's enough!

1384
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:29,848
Bad girl!

1385
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:38,072
Your lady teacher taught you that, yes?

1386
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:54,583
Are you a virgin?

1387
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,119
Yes.

1388
01:15:57,911 --> 01:15:59,800
What a bore.

1389
01:15:59,831 --> 01:16:01,720
What a bore you are, Elizabeth.

1390
01:16:01,751 --> 01:16:03,704
Libby, I should say.

1391
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,847
It would not even be amusing.

1392
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:15,128
Thank you, Mrs. Green.

1393
01:16:15,159 --> 01:16:16,919
Hello? What happened?

1394
01:16:16,952 --> 01:16:18,935
<i>What do you mean what happened?</i>

1395
01:16:18,968 --> 01:16:20,888
Well, he just dropped you off, that's all?

1396
01:16:21,463 --> 01:16:23,320
Yes, that's all.

1397
01:16:23,352 --> 01:16:24,920
But he did take your telephone number?

1398
01:16:24,951 --> 01:16:26,871
Yes, he did do that.

1399
01:16:26,904 --> 01:16:27,960
<i>I wouldn't count on it, Polly.</i>

1400
01:16:27,991 --> 01:16:30,519
You're the type older
people find attractive.

1401
01:16:30,551 --> 01:16:33,047
Older people and girls.

1402
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:35,927
<i>I'm afraid I rather neglected
Gus, did he mention that?</i>

1403
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:38,008
I had eyes only for Nils.

1404
01:16:38,039 --> 01:16:39,415
You know, the Baron.

1405
01:16:39,447 --> 01:16:41,560
And let me tell you what
happened with him last night.

1406
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:43,480
I left my iron on, Libby.

1407
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:44,759
But, Polly, wait a minute.

1408
01:16:44,792 --> 01:16:46,008
I've got to run. Bye.

1409
01:16:50,744 --> 01:16:52,023
I'll get it.

1410
01:16:53,367 --> 01:16:55,511
- Hello?
<i>- Miss Andrews?</i>

1411
01:16:55,543 --> 01:16:57,111
Yes, it is. <i>Gus Leroy.</i>

1412
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,927
Hello, Mr. Leroy.

1413
01:16:59,959 --> 01:17:02,807
Among other things, I've commissioned
an anthology of war poems

1414
01:17:02,839 --> 01:17:06,999
and I'm hoping for a fine novel to come
out of the Abraham Lincoln battalion.

1415
01:17:07,031 --> 01:17:10,167
Say, stop me if you don't care
that much about Loyalist Spain.

1416
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:11,511
I do.

1417
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:14,711
I'm a born champion of causes.

1418
01:17:14,743 --> 01:17:17,591
Well, my sympathies run a
little stronger than that

1419
01:17:17,623 --> 01:17:19,799
as Libby might have told you.

1420
01:17:19,831 --> 01:17:21,367
She did suggest it.

1421
01:17:23,031 --> 01:17:25,751
Also, no doubt, that my
wife and I have separated?

1422
01:17:28,759 --> 01:17:31,319
Well, Sundays are nice.

1423
01:17:32,887 --> 01:17:35,607
Little Gus and I get to the Bronx
Zoo, or the Statue of Liberty,

1424
01:17:35,639 --> 01:17:37,751
or feed the pigeons in the park.

1425
01:17:38,647 --> 01:17:40,759
As a Communist, by the way,

1426
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:42,294
I'm nothing the Party can boast of,

1427
01:17:42,327 --> 01:17:45,111
I'm not a Party member actually.

1428
01:17:45,143 --> 01:17:47,255
I don't march in the May Day parade.

1429
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:50,230
And the only part of the <i>Daily
Worker</i> I read are the sports pages.

1430
01:17:51,383 --> 01:17:53,110
Come in, Mr. Schneider.

1431
01:17:58,167 --> 01:18:00,790
Excuse me.

1432
01:18:00,823 --> 01:18:03,127
Mr. Schneider, this is Mr. Leroy.

1433
01:18:03,159 --> 01:18:04,374
How do you do?

1434
01:18:04,407 --> 01:18:06,487
Would you join us?

1435
01:18:06,519 --> 01:18:08,343
No. Some other time.

1436
01:18:09,782 --> 01:18:12,791
Very pleased, Mr. Leroy.
Very pleased indeed.

1437
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:15,255
Goodnight.

1438
01:18:15,287 --> 01:18:16,631
Goodnight.

1439
01:18:18,838 --> 01:18:21,110
It's just as well.

1440
01:18:21,143 --> 01:18:22,999
In no time at all, you'd have
been at each other's throats

1441
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:25,239
about the Moscow Trials.

1442
01:18:25,271 --> 01:18:26,358
Anti-Communist?

1443
01:18:26,391 --> 01:18:27,895
Anti-Stalinist.

1444
01:18:27,926 --> 01:18:29,590
A Trotskyite.

1445
01:18:29,623 --> 01:18:30,775
Rabid.

1446
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:32,247
Can I get you anything?

1447
01:18:32,278 --> 01:18:33,590
You know,

1448
01:18:33,623 --> 01:18:37,559
for some reason he was
unusually pleased to see me.

1449
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:41,239
Well, he's waited an awfully long
time to find a man in my room.

1450
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:42,838
Libby, I've shopped the whole store

1451
01:18:42,871 --> 01:18:44,246
and the bottle sterilizer is it.

1452
01:18:44,279 --> 01:18:45,335
Now, Dottie will love it.

1453
01:18:45,366 --> 01:18:46,678
It's only 27.50.

1454
01:18:46,711 --> 01:18:47,894
Well, you get a discount, don't you?

1455
01:18:47,927 --> 01:18:49,879
Libby, that's with the discount.

1456
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:51,799
We're splitting it five
ways, for heaven's sake.

1457
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,719
You, myself, Priss, Polly, and...

1458
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:54,999
Well, Helena phoned, she's in.

1459
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:57,238
Polly. The last time I talked
to her she had a date.

1460
01:18:58,327 --> 01:18:59,287
What's so funny?

1461
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:00,822
Polly with a date.

1462
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:14,870
It's bliss with you, Gus.

1463
01:19:14,903 --> 01:19:17,206
How would you know without
a point of comparison?

1464
01:19:23,062 --> 01:19:24,278
What is it?

1465
01:19:27,862 --> 01:19:31,894
Does it make sense, Polly, my
wanting to join up and go to Spain,

1466
01:19:31,927 --> 01:19:34,326
us notwithstanding?

1467
01:19:34,359 --> 01:19:36,086
You mean you have joined already?

1468
01:19:36,118 --> 01:19:38,678
No. Some problems.

1469
01:19:39,318 --> 01:19:40,534
Little Gus?

1470
01:19:40,566 --> 01:19:41,687
For one.

1471
01:19:41,718 --> 01:19:42,902
What else?

1472
01:19:45,238 --> 01:19:49,078
Polly, there's a thing
I have to confess to you.

1473
01:19:51,382 --> 01:19:53,590
I'm being psychoanalyzed.

1474
01:19:55,766 --> 01:19:57,655
Well, why?

1475
01:19:57,686 --> 01:20:00,406
It was Esther's idea, not mine.

1476
01:20:01,366 --> 01:20:04,214
You see I walked out because

1477
01:20:04,246 --> 01:20:08,214
I found out that she'd been running
around with someone, a Party organizer.

1478
01:20:08,246 --> 01:20:10,774
She wanted both of us
to be free in sexual matters.

1479
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:13,398
Well, I couldn't take that.

1480
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:16,438
And then one day she came to the
office in a calm frame of mind

1481
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:19,574
and suggested that we both go to analysts.

1482
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:22,294
If we both decided to be
divorced when we finished,

1483
01:20:22,326 --> 01:20:26,326
well, then we would have
gained certain insights.

1484
01:20:26,966 --> 01:20:29,078
Esther's favorite word.

1485
01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:33,014
Gus, if someone has
come into your life since

1486
01:20:33,046 --> 01:20:36,758
and then you've no doubt
about wanting a divorce,

1487
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:39,126
then what's the point of going on?

1488
01:20:39,158 --> 01:20:40,854
Your promise?

1489
01:20:40,886 --> 01:20:41,942
Mainly.

1490
01:20:43,126 --> 01:20:45,750
And this doctor...

1491
01:20:45,782 --> 01:20:47,894
Bijur. With a "J."

1492
01:20:52,918 --> 01:20:54,230
Does he know about us?

1493
01:20:54,262 --> 01:20:55,222
Yeah.

1494
01:20:56,277 --> 01:20:58,741
He was a little upset, to put it mildly.

1495
01:20:59,157 --> 01:21:00,469
Why?

1496
01:21:00,502 --> 01:21:02,870
A principle of analysis.

1497
01:21:02,901 --> 01:21:06,485
Rule 1, a patient is not supposed
to change his life situation

1498
01:21:06,518 --> 01:21:08,790
while undergoing analysis.

1499
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:12,630
And that's the real problem about Spain?

1500
01:21:12,662 --> 01:21:15,029
Well, that's what I'm trying
to work out in treatment.

1501
01:21:15,061 --> 01:21:16,629
Treatment?

1502
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:20,310
Do you mean he's found
something wrong with you?

1503
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:22,357
Listen, there's another rule.

1504
01:21:22,389 --> 01:21:27,349
A patient does not discuss his
illness with friends and family.

1505
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:30,325
Gus,

1506
01:21:30,358 --> 01:21:33,334
you're the most normal man that ever lived.

1507
01:21:33,365 --> 01:21:36,917
Twins? That big fat sow.

1508
01:21:36,949 --> 01:21:39,958
For some reason, Kay, twins
are positively indecent.

1509
01:21:39,989 --> 01:21:42,005
Not to mention having to buy two gifts.

1510
01:21:42,038 --> 01:21:44,566
Libby, please. I can't make a
career out of this gift buying.

1511
01:21:44,597 --> 01:21:46,230
Now, let's settle for the pair of robes.

1512
01:21:46,261 --> 01:21:48,277
It's $32 with the discount.

1513
01:21:48,309 --> 01:21:50,357
Now, you're not going to quibble
about a measly one-fifth of that.

1514
01:21:50,389 --> 01:21:53,845
No, but, my God, there's no end in sight.

1515
01:21:53,877 --> 01:21:56,149
Priss in her seventh month
positively inspired

1516
01:21:56,182 --> 01:21:57,813
and Dottie pregnant again.

1517
01:21:57,846 --> 01:22:01,205
Look, it's the robes, Libby.
I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.

1518
01:22:10,486 --> 01:22:13,718
Imagine him walking in like that.
Well, scared her to death.

1519
01:22:13,749 --> 01:22:15,765
<i>He looks awfully dragged, Kay says.</i>

1520
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:19,317
Well, if he was half as active on
the road as he was around town...

1521
01:22:19,349 --> 01:22:22,997
Kay says he must sit down to his next play.

1522
01:22:23,029 --> 01:22:24,886
Here we go again.

1523
01:22:24,917 --> 01:22:27,285
And what'll they do for Bridge,
with the Blakes breaking up?

1524
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:29,653
Norine's in Reno, I hear.

1525
01:22:29,685 --> 01:22:31,509
How are you, Priss?
Are you going to make it?

1526
01:22:31,541 --> 01:22:32,885
I'm trying.

1527
01:22:32,917 --> 01:22:35,573
<i>Good girl. When's Helena coming?</i>

1528
01:22:35,605 --> 01:22:37,685
Well, in time for the baby, she says.

1529
01:22:37,717 --> 01:22:40,405
How nice. What's up with Polly?

1530
01:22:40,437 --> 01:22:41,653
<i>Up?</i>

1531
01:22:41,685 --> 01:22:43,765
Now, come on, Priss, she's
got somebody on the string.

1532
01:22:43,797 --> 01:22:45,493
<i>The sly little thing.</i>

1533
01:22:45,525 --> 01:22:49,717
Well, it's got to be somebody at the
hospital, some pimply pathologist.

1534
01:22:49,748 --> 01:22:51,829
Well, I reached a decision finally, Polly.

1535
01:22:51,861 --> 01:22:53,493
Took long enough.

1536
01:22:53,525 --> 01:22:55,605
Spain is out. I'm not going.

1537
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,684
I'm glad in a way.

1538
01:22:57,717 --> 01:23:00,373
Why not? Or is that against the rules?

1539
01:23:00,405 --> 01:23:03,573
Well, Esther says that my
enlisting is irresponsible.

1540
01:23:03,605 --> 01:23:05,333
I don't want to finish my analysis,

1541
01:23:05,364 --> 01:23:09,173
and instead I'm running away from
my problems and responsibilities.

1542
01:23:09,204 --> 01:23:11,828
Her support and the child's for one thing.

1543
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:15,189
Well, Dr. Bijur agrees more or less.
I could be running away.

1544
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:17,877
He agrees? You mean, he
and Esther discussed it?

1545
01:23:17,909 --> 01:23:19,605
Good heavens, Polly,

1546
01:23:19,637 --> 01:23:22,996
are you suggesting Bijur and Esther
are in cahoots or something?

1547
01:23:23,029 --> 01:23:26,677
Forgive me, Gus. It's just my ignorance.

1548
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:29,653
But he did say you ought not to go.

1549
01:23:29,685 --> 01:23:31,829
Well, to that effect.

1550
01:23:31,861 --> 01:23:34,389
I thought analysts weren't
supposed to give advice.

1551
01:23:34,420 --> 01:23:36,948
That's true. The analyst
is completely neutral.

1552
01:23:36,981 --> 01:23:39,124
He listens and asks questions.

1553
01:23:39,157 --> 01:23:41,269
He did more in this case it seems.

1554
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:42,485
Well, that's the theory.

1555
01:23:42,516 --> 01:23:45,557
But sometimes being human,
he steps in as a human being.

1556
01:23:45,588 --> 01:23:47,125
I should think he'd step in as a doctor.

1557
01:23:47,156 --> 01:23:49,205
No, no, he doesn't step in at all.

1558
01:23:49,236 --> 01:23:52,693
You see, the patient is
always trying to involve him.

1559
01:23:52,724 --> 01:23:54,836
Patients are cunning.

1560
01:23:54,869 --> 01:23:57,749
Maybe my wanting to enlist was
a trap to get him interested

1561
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:59,253
in my personal decision.

1562
01:23:59,284 --> 01:24:00,948
A play for attention.

1563
01:24:00,981 --> 01:24:03,380
Maybe I was just playing soldier.

1564
01:24:03,988 --> 01:24:05,685
Were you?

1565
01:24:05,716 --> 01:24:08,276
I believed you. Weren't you sincere?

1566
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:09,652
But how do I know?

1567
01:24:09,684 --> 01:24:11,156
Good Lord, Gus.

1568
01:24:11,189 --> 01:24:13,557
You act as if you're not
you but some opaque object

1569
01:24:13,588 --> 01:24:15,604
whose motives you can only guess at.

1570
01:24:15,637 --> 01:24:18,996
What I can't decide is, is it something
basic in you that's indecisive

1571
01:24:19,028 --> 01:24:22,132
or is it the effect of the treatment?

1572
01:24:22,164 --> 01:24:26,676
Well, if you could decide, dear,
that might solve everything.

1573
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:30,068
I'm sorry, Gus. I'm breaking all the rules.

1574
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:33,877
Well, even that might help.

1575
01:24:33,908 --> 01:24:36,149
The treatment's bogged down, Polly.

1576
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:37,428
I'm blocked.

1577
01:24:37,461 --> 01:24:40,308
Blocked? What does that mean exactly?

1578
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:42,804
I don't dream.

1579
01:24:42,836 --> 01:24:45,268
It's funny. I've stopped
dreaming completely.

1580
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:46,612
Is that so serious?

1581
01:24:46,644 --> 01:24:47,892
It's a hell of a note.

1582
01:24:47,925 --> 01:24:50,324
If I don't dream, I've got
nothing to say to Bijur.

1583
01:24:50,356 --> 01:24:51,924
Nothing at all? Not a damn word.

1584
01:24:51,956 --> 01:24:53,876
Every day it's the same thing.

1585
01:24:53,908 --> 01:24:55,668
I go in, "Good afternoon, Doctor."

1586
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,204
I lie down on the couch.

1587
01:24:57,236 --> 01:24:59,764
"Any dreams?" says Bijur,
picking up his notebook.

1588
01:24:59,796 --> 01:25:02,004
"No," I says. He lays down his notebook.

1589
01:25:02,036 --> 01:25:03,188
Silence.

1590
01:25:03,220 --> 01:25:05,684
At the end of 50 minutes,
he tells me the hour is over,

1591
01:25:05,716 --> 01:25:08,340
I hand him my five bucks, "So long, Doctor."

1592
01:25:09,556 --> 01:25:12,884
If you only knew what I've been imagining.

1593
01:25:12,916 --> 01:25:14,964
What about? My analysis?

1594
01:25:14,996 --> 01:25:17,140
I was afraid you talked about me.

1595
01:25:18,484 --> 01:25:20,404
Why should I talk about you?

1596
01:25:21,108 --> 01:25:24,948
Well, I mean sex.

1597
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:26,932
You goop.

1598
01:25:26,964 --> 01:25:28,851
Patient doesn't talk about real sex,

1599
01:25:28,884 --> 01:25:31,668
he talks about sexual
fantasy, if he has any.

1600
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:32,851
At $5 an hour?

1601
01:25:32,884 --> 01:25:34,388
And Esther's five.

1602
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:36,787
Before long the savings will be shot.

1603
01:25:37,908 --> 01:25:40,372
Then that'll be the end of that.

1604
01:25:40,404 --> 01:25:42,132
Unless analysts extend credit.

1605
01:25:42,164 --> 01:25:44,276
Analysts.

1606
01:25:44,308 --> 01:25:46,004
They're worse than the telephone company

1607
01:25:46,035 --> 01:25:48,467
and Consolidated Edison put together.

1608
01:25:50,035 --> 01:25:53,684
Gus, let's go to the movies tonight.

1609
01:25:54,260 --> 01:25:55,828
Find one with sex.

1610
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:59,348
Real sex, no fantasy.

1611
01:25:59,379 --> 01:26:01,076
The nativity has been accomplished

1612
01:26:01,108 --> 01:26:03,284
and the feast of St. Stephen.

1613
01:26:03,315 --> 01:26:06,324
Stephen Crockett, that's
a lovely name, Priss.

1614
01:26:06,355 --> 01:26:07,732
Right out of Dickens.

1615
01:26:07,763 --> 01:26:08,916
And breastfed.

1616
01:26:08,948 --> 01:26:11,444
I never expected a breastfed grandson.

1617
01:26:11,476 --> 01:26:15,028
You never expected a grandson.

1618
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:17,556
Little Mrs. Crockett,
the chest is wonderful.

1619
01:26:17,588 --> 01:26:20,595
She's so flat down there, she's
never had to wear a brassiere.

1620
01:26:20,628 --> 01:26:23,027
It's not the size that counts, girls.

1621
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:25,907
Mother, show them the
christening robe Lakey sent.

1622
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:29,076
Beautiful. Fit for a dauphin.

1623
01:26:29,107 --> 01:26:32,404
Dottie sent a pram, and Pokey, baby scales.

1624
01:26:32,435 --> 01:26:35,475
Pokey? Why, I hear the twins are
as plump and as rosy as she is.

1625
01:26:35,507 --> 01:26:38,003
And bottle-fed, Sloan.
What do you make of that?

1626
01:26:38,035 --> 01:26:39,923
By nursing.

1627
01:26:39,955 --> 01:26:43,316
Priss can give Stephen her immunities
for at least the first year

1628
01:26:43,347 --> 01:26:46,452
against measles, chicken
pox, whooping cough.

1629
01:26:46,483 --> 01:26:49,875
Do you realize that all the babies on
this floor are on bottles except Stephen,

1630
01:26:49,907 --> 01:26:52,883
and I can tell you the
nurses prefer it that way.

1631
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,515
Let's get this eggnog down, dear.

1632
01:26:54,547 --> 01:26:56,052
Sloan, I've drunk quarts of it.

1633
01:26:56,083 --> 01:26:58,836
Come now, we're not still
bedpan shy, are we?

1634
01:27:00,404 --> 01:27:03,475
That's him. I'd know that voice anywhere.

1635
01:27:03,507 --> 01:27:04,755
That's your boy, Priss.

1636
01:27:04,787 --> 01:27:06,868
He yells louder than the
rest of them together.

1637
01:27:06,899 --> 01:27:09,843
And at night Priss says,
steady like a buzz saw.

1638
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:11,603
Develops his lungs, like a bellows.

1639
01:27:13,588 --> 01:27:15,475
Excuse us, please. Feeding time.

1640
01:27:15,508 --> 01:27:17,907
Everybody out, including me.

1641
01:27:17,939 --> 01:27:20,947
I'll go on home now, dear. See
you first thing in the morning.

1642
01:27:20,979 --> 01:27:22,195
Goodbye, Priss.

1643
01:27:22,227 --> 01:27:23,763
All right, girls.

1644
01:27:25,459 --> 01:27:27,635
Goodbye. Thank you.

1645
01:27:27,667 --> 01:27:29,619
Thank you, Kay. Call me.

1646
01:27:32,499 --> 01:27:34,675
I'll wait for you down in the lounge.

1647
01:27:44,563 --> 01:27:46,130
Which one is it tonight, dear?

1648
01:27:46,163 --> 01:27:47,795
The right.

1649
01:27:58,579 --> 01:28:00,371
Does it hurt?

1650
01:28:00,403 --> 01:28:02,450
Just a bit. At first.

1651
01:28:02,483 --> 01:28:04,147
You sensitive there?

1652
01:28:04,179 --> 01:28:06,323
Yes, I could never bear to be...

1653
01:28:11,315 --> 01:28:13,587
Relax, dear. Baby knows when you're tense.

1654
01:28:15,954 --> 01:28:18,259
Catherine, he keeps pushing it away.

1655
01:28:21,139 --> 01:28:22,931
Did you hear him last night?

1656
01:28:22,963 --> 01:28:25,171
Exactly two hours without stopping.

1657
01:28:25,202 --> 01:28:26,803
And eleven minutes.

1658
01:28:28,467 --> 01:28:30,962
It's a vicious circle, isn't it?

1659
01:28:30,995 --> 01:28:33,682
He wears himself out because he's famished,

1660
01:28:33,715 --> 01:28:36,243
and then he is too exhausted to nurse.

1661
01:28:36,275 --> 01:28:38,067
There, he seems fine now.

1662
01:28:38,963 --> 01:28:40,914
Three minutes, 12 more to go.

1663
01:28:43,378 --> 01:28:46,899
Look on the bright side. They used
to say it developed the bust.

1664
01:29:01,459 --> 01:29:02,963
I dozed off.

1665
01:29:02,994 --> 01:29:06,290
He was asleep when I woke up, I
don't know when he stopped nursing.

1666
01:29:06,322 --> 01:29:07,827
I'm sure he hasn't finished.

1667
01:29:07,858 --> 01:29:09,426
He's had something.

1668
01:29:09,458 --> 01:29:10,963
Weigh him, Catherine.

1669
01:29:10,994 --> 01:29:14,195
He's such a little thing
and he terrifies me.

1670
01:29:14,226 --> 01:29:15,634
My own flesh and blood.

1671
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:17,267
Well, how did we do?

1672
01:29:17,298 --> 01:29:18,643
Fine, Doctor.

1673
01:29:18,674 --> 01:29:19,890
We dozed off for a few seconds,

1674
01:29:19,922 --> 01:29:21,554
but Stephen got his two ounces, I think.

1675
01:29:21,586 --> 01:29:24,403
Good. Good.

1676
01:29:24,434 --> 01:29:27,346
Great supervisor, if she
weren't in the bottle rot.

1677
01:29:29,555 --> 01:29:31,571
Did she tell you how long
he cried last night?

1678
01:29:31,602 --> 01:29:34,451
She didn't have to, Sloan.

1679
01:29:34,482 --> 01:29:37,394
Well, what I care about is the weight curve.

1680
01:29:37,426 --> 01:29:40,115
And that is satisfactory.

1681
01:29:40,146 --> 01:29:43,186
If he didn't get enough
there'll be vocalizing tonight.

1682
01:29:43,218 --> 01:29:46,354
If it bothers you so much, have them
get you some plugs for your ears.

1683
01:29:46,386 --> 01:29:48,914
Turning a deaf ear to a hungry baby?

1684
01:29:50,034 --> 01:29:52,594
That's like people who
don't see bread lines.

1685
01:29:52,626 --> 01:29:55,826
Great heavens, the liberal!

1686
01:29:56,978 --> 01:29:58,514
Now, do as I tell you, Priss.

1687
01:29:58,546 --> 01:30:00,434
Get some plugs for your ears.

1688
01:30:02,002 --> 01:30:04,146
Be a nice, sensible girl.

1689
01:30:06,674 --> 01:30:08,402
I have to run. I've a call to make.

1690
01:30:08,434 --> 01:30:09,458
Okay.

1691
01:30:26,961 --> 01:30:29,042
God, please.

1692
01:30:50,034 --> 01:30:52,370
I was just going to ring.

1693
01:30:52,402 --> 01:30:55,026
He's breaking all records tonight.

1694
01:30:55,057 --> 01:30:56,434
There we go.

1695
01:30:59,442 --> 01:31:02,385
Mrs. Crockett, I just talked to Dr. Turner.

1696
01:31:02,418 --> 01:31:04,690
I recommended a supplementary
bottle for Stephen and he agreed.

1697
01:31:04,722 --> 01:31:06,673
Bottle? No!

1698
01:31:06,706 --> 01:31:08,913
Your milk is adequate from a
nutritional point of view,

1699
01:31:08,945 --> 01:31:10,450
but it doesn't give him enough volume.

1700
01:31:10,482 --> 01:31:12,914
Did you talk to... Dr. Crockett?

1701
01:31:12,945 --> 01:31:14,513
No.

1702
01:31:14,546 --> 01:31:15,954
Till Stephen leaves this hospital,

1703
01:31:15,985 --> 01:31:17,714
your obstetrician is in charge.

1704
01:31:17,745 --> 01:31:20,402
But the weight curve. He said that it was...

1705
01:31:23,953 --> 01:31:25,265
He's got it.

1706
01:31:30,706 --> 01:31:33,586
I know how you feel, my dear.

1707
01:31:33,617 --> 01:31:36,370
Most mothers cry when I have to tell them.

1708
01:31:36,401 --> 01:31:39,281
They want to keep on trying.

1709
01:31:39,313 --> 01:31:42,609
Oddly enough, there are
fewer of them these days.

1710
01:31:42,642 --> 01:31:46,930
The poor patients feel that the
bottle is socially superior.

1711
01:31:46,961 --> 01:31:50,193
And the rich ones,
even if they have the milk,

1712
01:31:50,225 --> 01:31:52,082
they feel nursing is peasant.

1713
01:31:57,265 --> 01:31:58,673
Let's get some sleep.

1714
01:32:00,561 --> 01:32:01,553
Silence.

1715
01:32:03,025 --> 01:32:04,305
Beautiful, isn't it?

1716
01:32:09,137 --> 01:32:10,193
Miss Swenson.

1717
01:32:10,226 --> 01:32:11,281
Yes?

1718
01:32:12,177 --> 01:32:13,937
Are you a Democrat?

1719
01:32:16,497 --> 01:32:17,937
Yes, dear. I am.

1720
01:32:19,377 --> 01:32:20,593
Goodnight.

1721
01:32:32,497 --> 01:32:33,745
Good morning, Sloan.

1722
01:32:33,777 --> 01:32:35,345
Good morning, dear.

1723
01:32:37,713 --> 01:32:42,481
Well, I see by the chart that you were
high-pressured into accepting the bottle.

1724
01:32:42,513 --> 01:32:45,841
Sloan, does it really make
that much difference?

1725
01:32:45,873 --> 01:32:50,833
I think we have both been a
little silly about this nursing.

1726
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:54,673
We just wanted to give Stephen the
best possible start, that's all.

1727
01:32:57,072 --> 01:33:00,593
No one has the guts to go through
with an experiment these days.

1728
01:33:01,681 --> 01:33:04,144
A baby yells, they hand him a bottle.

1729
01:33:06,097 --> 01:33:07,888
That's like your friend Roosevelt

1730
01:33:07,921 --> 01:33:09,329
and his softheaded social workers

1731
01:33:09,361 --> 01:33:11,472
listening to the whimpers
of the down and out.

1732
01:33:11,505 --> 01:33:14,352
The economy would have recovered by itself.

1733
01:33:14,385 --> 01:33:18,385
As it is now, it's just sick,
pumped full of formula.

1734
01:33:18,417 --> 01:33:20,049
I think that's rather funny.

1735
01:33:20,081 --> 01:33:22,609
I don't admit the comparison.

1736
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,785
Good old Priss, never give an inch.

1737
01:33:26,321 --> 01:33:29,681
Sloan, what do you mean by experiment?

1738
01:33:29,712 --> 01:33:32,144
Simply to prove that any woman can nurse.

1739
01:33:32,177 --> 01:33:33,808
That's not fair.

1740
01:33:33,841 --> 01:33:37,009
Stephen has been crying for 10 hours a day.

1741
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:39,728
The nurses pick him up when he cries.

1742
01:33:39,761 --> 01:33:42,800
So naturally, he's already
learned to cry to get attention.

1743
01:33:42,833 --> 01:33:45,840
Now when you get him home, you're not
to pick him up except to change him.

1744
01:33:45,873 --> 01:33:50,417
And once you've established that he's not
cold or wet, back he goes into the basket.

1745
01:33:52,881 --> 01:33:54,672
What about the bottle?

1746
01:33:54,705 --> 01:33:57,233
Well, one for the time being.

1747
01:33:57,937 --> 01:33:59,472
But when we get him home,

1748
01:33:59,505 --> 01:34:02,160
there's a little idea I want to try.

1749
01:34:02,193 --> 01:34:04,592
The breast every three hours
instead of every four.

1750
01:34:04,624 --> 01:34:06,320
But, Sloan... I know.

1751
01:34:06,352 --> 01:34:09,200
Would you have enough milk?
That's just the point.

1752
01:34:09,232 --> 01:34:12,849
Your milk would be more stimulated
by more frequent nursing.

1753
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,792
Anyway, that's what I want to try.

1754
01:34:15,825 --> 01:34:18,353
I've got to run, my whole schedule is off.

1755
01:34:18,384 --> 01:34:20,144
I'll look in on you later.

1756
01:34:20,177 --> 01:34:21,616
Have a good day.

1757
01:34:31,536 --> 01:34:32,784
Yes?

1758
01:34:32,816 --> 01:34:35,984
Julie Bentkamp just called, a
big shot on <i>Woman's World.</i>

1759
01:34:36,016 --> 01:34:38,673
She's mad to have an article
on how it feels to be nursing.

1760
01:34:38,704 --> 01:34:40,593
<i>You can write it under a
pseudonym, if you like.</i>

1761
01:34:40,624 --> 01:34:43,152
The thing is you must be sure
to put in your bust dimensions.

1762
01:34:43,184 --> 01:34:44,400
Well, not in so many words, of course,

1763
01:34:44,433 --> 01:34:46,928
but you must get over that
you're not a perfect 36.

1764
01:34:46,961 --> 01:34:48,848
Otherwise, the reader would miss the point.

1765
01:34:48,881 --> 01:34:51,600
<i>And things like you were
Phi Beta Kappa at college,</i>

1766
01:34:51,632 --> 01:34:52,752
<i>and worked for the government.</i>

1767
01:34:52,784 --> 01:34:54,160
I won't do it, Libby.

1768
01:34:54,192 --> 01:34:55,984
Don't be silly.

1769
01:34:56,016 --> 01:34:58,586
Your style would be too dry, of
course, but I'll rewrite it for you.

1770
01:34:59,632 --> 01:35:02,224
Yes? Come in, Polly.

1771
01:35:02,256 --> 01:35:04,528
<i>Is that Polly? Say hello.</i>

1772
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:05,872
<i>Now, I'll write all the descriptive parts</i>

1773
01:35:05,904 --> 01:35:08,304
and emotions if you just
honestly tell me what it's like.

1774
01:35:08,335 --> 01:35:10,864
No, Libby. Not under any circumstances.

1775
01:35:12,016 --> 01:35:13,200
Why not?

1776
01:35:13,232 --> 01:35:16,720
It's in poor taste, that's why not.

1777
01:35:16,752 --> 01:35:18,800
Why, I don't see that at all.

1778
01:35:18,832 --> 01:35:21,360
Is it in poor taste to talk about it?

1779
01:35:21,392 --> 01:35:23,664
Why, it's the most natural
thing in the world.

1780
01:35:23,695 --> 01:35:26,800
In Italy, the women do it in public,
and nobody thinks a thing about it.

1781
01:35:26,831 --> 01:35:29,072
I'm not going to do it in public.

1782
01:35:29,103 --> 01:35:30,480
If it's so natural,

1783
01:35:30,512 --> 01:35:33,551
then why are you so excited
about putting it in a magazine?

1784
01:35:33,584 --> 01:35:36,496
It's because you think
it's unnatural, that's why.

1785
01:35:38,224 --> 01:35:39,632
Priss, don't.

1786
01:35:40,464 --> 01:35:42,287
That's just Libby,

1787
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,104
with a big red scar in
her face called a mouth,

1788
01:35:45,136 --> 01:35:46,735
as Lakey used to say.

1789
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:49,840
It's not that.

1790
01:35:52,272 --> 01:35:54,992
Who'd a thunk it, Polly,

1791
01:35:55,023 --> 01:35:58,736
that one day I'd just be an experiment.

1792
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:06,416
And that my son would be
raised by a Republican.

1793
01:36:17,392 --> 01:36:21,263
And now, to unveil the mystery,

1794
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:27,119
a distinguished early work entitled,

1795
01:36:29,999 --> 01:36:33,775
<i>Time Is Fleeting, Never to Return.</i>

1796
01:36:42,479 --> 01:36:46,960
Naked, Polly, at our age, in
front of all those gawking men!

1797
01:36:46,991 --> 01:36:49,359
I mean, how undergraduate can you get?

1798
01:36:49,391 --> 01:36:53,103
But that's little Helena for
you, the sexless wonder.

1799
01:36:53,135 --> 01:36:55,407
You sneaked away early, didn't you, dear?

1800
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:57,487
<i>The big Saturday night date.
What gives with that?</i>

1801
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,343
Let's not pry, dear.

1802
01:36:59,375 --> 01:37:00,943
Come on over and gab. And a movie later.

1803
01:37:00,975 --> 01:37:02,831
I can't. I'm going to bed early.

1804
01:37:02,863 --> 01:37:04,879
Tired? Or just boasting?

1805
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:08,623
<i>Polly? Polly.</i>

1806
01:37:08,655 --> 01:37:10,095
Goodbye, Libby.

1807
01:37:12,143 --> 01:37:13,711
It's Sunday. You lost?

1808
01:37:14,319 --> 01:37:15,599
Got off early.

1809
01:37:15,631 --> 01:37:16,751
Come in.

1810
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:22,383
Take your coat off.

1811
01:37:22,991 --> 01:37:24,143
Sit down.

1812
01:37:25,263 --> 01:37:26,863
Where'd you go today?

1813
01:37:27,471 --> 01:37:28,879
Aquarium.

1814
01:37:28,911 --> 01:37:30,383
Did he like it?

1815
01:37:30,415 --> 01:37:32,431
He was fascinated.

1816
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:35,247
And you, the washing ritual?

1817
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:37,103
With the usual fantasies.

1818
01:37:38,383 --> 01:37:41,071
I mentally slew Esther,

1819
01:37:41,103 --> 01:37:43,631
you and I lived happily ever after.

1820
01:37:43,663 --> 01:37:45,903
Then, the usual pangs of conscience.

1821
01:37:47,535 --> 01:37:50,383
When I got back, Esther
and I had a long talk.

1822
01:37:51,503 --> 01:37:53,102
About my analysis.

1823
01:37:54,191 --> 01:37:55,630
Hers is going great.

1824
01:37:55,663 --> 01:37:57,839
She dreamt she went
to her analyst's funeral,

1825
01:37:57,871 --> 01:37:59,566
she's having her last hour next week.

1826
01:37:59,599 --> 01:38:01,519
Well, that's progress.

1827
01:38:01,551 --> 01:38:05,391
My own news wasn't so good. I had
to tell her I was still blocked.

1828
01:38:05,423 --> 01:38:07,919
Tell me, Gus, what are
you being treated for?

1829
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:09,743
What's its name?

1830
01:38:09,774 --> 01:38:13,103
Compulsion neurosis? Anxiety neurosis?

1831
01:38:13,135 --> 01:38:15,790
My father's disease is called melancholia.

1832
01:38:15,823 --> 01:38:17,358
Get the hospital out of your mind, Polly.

1833
01:38:17,391 --> 01:38:19,438
I went, I told you,

1834
01:38:19,471 --> 01:38:23,343
because Esther wanted a free
relationship and I couldn't take it.

1835
01:38:23,374 --> 01:38:25,007
That's natural, surely.

1836
01:38:25,038 --> 01:38:26,831
In our culture, yes.

1837
01:38:27,759 --> 01:38:29,838
Don't you see?

1838
01:38:29,871 --> 01:38:33,519
I do have a conflict between
everything in our culture

1839
01:38:33,551 --> 01:38:35,598
and what I profess to believe politically.

1840
01:38:35,631 --> 01:38:37,999
Hasn't almost everyone?

1841
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:41,614
I mean, of our generation,
maybe not exactly Communism.

1842
01:38:51,343 --> 01:38:52,974
What did Esther say?

1843
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:59,375
She thinks I'd unblock if I
stopped seeing you for a time.

1844
01:39:02,574 --> 01:39:03,662
She's...

1845
01:39:07,694 --> 01:39:12,430
She says the part of me that's
weak clings to you for support.

1846
01:39:12,463 --> 01:39:16,782
The fact that you work in a hospital
makes me see you as a nurse.

1847
01:39:18,158 --> 01:39:20,655
If I got well, I'd have to leave my nurse.

1848
01:39:22,094 --> 01:39:24,558
What do you think of that?

1849
01:39:24,590 --> 01:39:29,070
Well, I think Esther ought not to
practice medicine without a license.

1850
01:39:30,255 --> 01:39:32,206
You're going to do what
Esther says, aren't you?

1851
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:34,222
That's why you came here today.

1852
01:39:34,254 --> 01:39:38,510
Hell, Polly, I don't suggest that
I'd believe what Esther says,

1853
01:39:40,078 --> 01:39:43,918
but if we did stop seeing
each other for a little while

1854
01:39:43,951 --> 01:39:46,926
and I unblock, that might prove something.

1855
01:39:46,958 --> 01:39:50,702
If I didn't unblock that would
prove that she was wrong.

1856
01:39:50,734 --> 01:39:52,494
She knows you very well.

1857
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:57,870
You sound catty like other women.

1858
01:39:57,902 --> 01:39:59,310
I'm like other women.

1859
01:39:59,342 --> 01:40:00,750
No, you're not.

1860
01:40:03,534 --> 01:40:05,838
You're like a girl in a fairy story.

1861
01:40:07,022 --> 01:40:08,494
Unreal, you mean?

1862
01:40:09,773 --> 01:40:12,014
That's why you're going to let me go?

1863
01:40:13,261 --> 01:40:15,150
I'm not going to let you go.

1864
01:40:17,101 --> 01:40:19,470
It's just that...

1865
01:40:19,502 --> 01:40:21,710
Well, you know the agreement.

1866
01:40:21,742 --> 01:40:24,622
If I don't finish my analysis, no divorce.

1867
01:40:25,838 --> 01:40:28,430
You understand, don't you?

1868
01:40:28,462 --> 01:40:31,310
And I understand that you're
going back to Esther.

1869
01:40:31,342 --> 01:40:33,614
You don't think you are, but you are.

1870
01:40:34,637 --> 01:40:36,238
Why do you say that?

1871
01:40:36,909 --> 01:40:40,045
Little Gus, the Party,

1872
01:40:40,078 --> 01:40:42,638
psychoanalysis. Polly...

1873
01:40:42,669 --> 01:40:44,622
It's all built into you.

1874
01:40:46,509 --> 01:40:49,037
It's been awfully tough.

1875
01:40:49,070 --> 01:40:51,821
You don't know, these Sundays... Mine, too.

1876
01:40:51,854 --> 01:40:56,078
Conscience pangs, I've never approved
of divorce where there were children.

1877
01:41:00,461 --> 01:41:03,949
I'll call you toward the end of the week.

1878
01:41:04,942 --> 01:41:08,110
See if you're all right, okay?

1879
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:15,469
If you need anything, you just call.

1880
01:41:17,933 --> 01:41:20,846
Is there something I should
have done differently?

1881
01:41:20,877 --> 01:41:22,861
Tell me the truth, Polly.

1882
01:41:24,142 --> 01:41:26,701
A silly thing.

1883
01:41:26,733 --> 01:41:30,317
That you left your overcoat on
like it was a business call.

1884
01:41:33,293 --> 01:41:35,021
I said it was silly.

1885
01:41:45,837 --> 01:41:48,461
Please, Mr. Schneider, please...

1886
01:41:48,494 --> 01:41:50,509
Please excuse me tonight.

1887
01:41:50,541 --> 01:41:52,973
Schneider? Who the hell is he?

1888
01:42:00,813 --> 01:42:02,285
Remember me? Henry Andrews?

1889
01:42:02,317 --> 01:42:04,589
Father!

1890
01:42:06,477 --> 01:42:08,717
Be careful of these fresh farm eggs.

1891
01:42:10,349 --> 01:42:11,981
I'm so happy to see you.

1892
01:42:12,013 --> 01:42:15,821
Well, that's perfect.

1893
01:42:15,853 --> 01:42:17,837
'Cause I thought I'll come
and live with you, that is,

1894
01:42:17,869 --> 01:42:20,301
if you're not otherwise encumbered.

1895
01:42:20,333 --> 01:42:22,061
Quite nice, quite nice.

1896
01:42:22,093 --> 01:42:24,461
And a place to let upstairs, I see.

1897
01:42:24,493 --> 01:42:26,765
It couldn't be better.

1898
01:42:26,797 --> 01:42:30,829
Father, what's the meaning of...

1899
01:42:30,861 --> 01:42:34,029
Your mother and I have
decided to get a divorce.

1900
01:42:34,061 --> 01:42:35,213
A divorce?

1901
01:42:38,669 --> 01:42:41,421
By the way, my mental health is excellent.

1902
01:42:48,621 --> 01:42:52,077
Well, Polly, it all started when they
changed the name of his illness.

1903
01:42:52,109 --> 01:42:54,029
They don't call it melancholia anymore,

1904
01:42:54,061 --> 01:42:56,749
they call it manic something
or other, I don't know.

1905
01:42:56,781 --> 01:42:58,925
Anyway, when he found out about it,

1906
01:42:58,957 --> 01:43:01,069
he just cheered up tremendously.

1907
01:43:01,101 --> 01:43:03,629
He started all kinds of new projects,

1908
01:43:03,661 --> 01:43:07,309
beginning with this notion that, you
know, we ought to have a divorce.

1909
01:43:07,341 --> 01:43:08,909
Can't you just live apart?

1910
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:11,309
Your father says that living
apart without divorce

1911
01:43:11,341 --> 01:43:14,700
is like living together without marriage.
It just isn't respectable.

1912
01:43:14,733 --> 01:43:16,045
Is he giving you any trouble?

1913
01:43:16,076 --> 01:43:18,157
No. No, everything is fine.

1914
01:43:18,188 --> 01:43:20,077
He has room upstairs. I'm glad to have him.

1915
01:43:20,108 --> 01:43:23,981
Well, now, if there're any problems,
Polly, I want you to call me.

1916
01:43:24,012 --> 01:43:25,516
I'll stay in touch, Mother.

1917
01:43:25,549 --> 01:43:28,173
You do, darling. And give
my regards to your father.

1918
01:43:29,389 --> 01:43:30,349
Bye.

1919
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:35,149
<i>Dr. Townsend. Dr. Townsend.</i>

1920
01:43:38,508 --> 01:43:39,628
Come in.

1921
01:43:42,733 --> 01:43:44,237
Hello.

1922
01:43:44,268 --> 01:43:46,669
Excuse me, Doctor.

1923
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:49,228
I was wondering, if you have a free moment,

1924
01:43:50,413 --> 01:43:53,037
could I ask your advice
on a personal matter?

1925
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:57,292
Well, I was just thinking
of taking a coffee break.

1926
01:43:58,572 --> 01:44:00,461
I'll buy you some, if you're free.

1927
01:44:00,492 --> 01:44:03,501
You see, at Riggs, he was just depressed.

1928
01:44:03,532 --> 01:44:06,156
He used to cry a lot, but very quietly.

1929
01:44:06,188 --> 01:44:08,428
And now this manic thing.

1930
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:09,676
Now this sudden divorce idea

1931
01:44:09,709 --> 01:44:12,204
does suggest a manic
elation, but in a mild form.

1932
01:44:12,237 --> 01:44:14,765
Depression might follow,
but not necessarily severe.

1933
01:44:14,796 --> 01:44:15,884
How old is he?

1934
01:44:15,916 --> 01:44:17,389
About 60.

1935
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:20,844
At that age, some depressive
patients spontaneously recover.

1936
01:44:20,877 --> 01:44:23,244
Aside from this divorce,
any other recent symptoms?

1937
01:44:23,276 --> 01:44:24,877
Very free with money for instance?

1938
01:44:24,908 --> 01:44:25,964
No.

1939
01:44:25,996 --> 01:44:27,564
Sudden interest in politics?

1940
01:44:27,596 --> 01:44:30,508
I mean, with a sense of mission,
some pet formula to save the world.

1941
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:31,820
No. Nothing like that.

1942
01:44:31,852 --> 01:44:35,116
My father was never interested in politics.

1943
01:44:35,148 --> 01:44:36,364
Would you like me to see him?

1944
01:44:36,397 --> 01:44:38,540
I'd be very grateful if you would.

1945
01:44:38,572 --> 01:44:42,157
Perhaps for drinks some
afternoon, if you're off duty.

1946
01:44:42,188 --> 01:44:44,908
Or dinner. My father loves to cook.

1947
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:46,476
But not until he's settled.

1948
01:44:46,508 --> 01:44:48,204
Whenever you say.

1949
01:44:48,236 --> 01:44:50,284
Thank you very much.

1950
01:44:50,316 --> 01:44:52,236
If you'll excuse me,

1951
01:44:52,268 --> 01:44:55,340
I have a metabolism test
I have to make before lunch.

1952
01:44:55,372 --> 01:44:58,668
Thank you very much for the coffee.

1953
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:02,284
Divorcing at their age. Helena,
that's a dreadful shock to Polly.

1954
01:45:02,316 --> 01:45:04,940
<i>And on top of it, her father moving in.</i>

1955
01:45:04,972 --> 01:45:06,444
<i>If there is someone in Polly's life</i>

1956
01:45:06,476 --> 01:45:09,964
what chance is she going to have with
him now saddled with a mental case.

1957
01:45:09,996 --> 01:45:13,676
Simple meal. Duck a I'orange. Not bad
Roquefort. Soupe a la Grand Marnier.

1958
01:45:13,708 --> 01:45:15,468
Limited kitchen facilities, you see.

1959
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,804
Would you oblige me by opening
the champagne, Doctor?

1960
01:45:17,835 --> 01:45:19,948
I picked up that wine cooler
for a song the other day.

1961
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:22,508
A little tucked away place. Couldn't
resist a serving platter, either.

1962
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:26,284
You'll find silver is half
the enjoyment of good food.

1963
01:45:26,316 --> 01:45:28,908
Divorce is a splendid institution.

1964
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:30,923
Everyone should get a divorce.

1965
01:45:30,956 --> 01:45:32,428
You haven't got yours yet, Father.

1966
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:33,708
Can't fail, my dear,

1967
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:36,364
after all, I gave your mother
the best grounds there are.

1968
01:45:36,396 --> 01:45:38,028
Insanity.

1969
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:40,140
Are you a psychiatrist
by any chance, Doctor?

1970
01:45:40,171 --> 01:45:42,636
No. General medicine.

1971
01:45:42,668 --> 01:45:46,379
Well, I'm not one of your
bourgeois neurotics, you know.

1972
01:45:46,412 --> 01:45:48,588
No, indeed, I go the whole hog.

1973
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:49,963
Quite mad.

1974
01:45:49,996 --> 01:45:52,747
We, madmen, are the aristocrats
of mental illness.

1975
01:45:54,571 --> 01:45:56,939
Would you pour the wine, Doctor?

1976
01:45:56,972 --> 01:45:59,756
What I'd give for a kitchen large enough

1977
01:45:59,788 --> 01:46:02,059
for a man to turn around.

1978
01:46:03,371 --> 01:46:05,227
Have you ever been up on
the third floor, Polly?

1979
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:06,347
No.

1980
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:07,596
Well, knock out a few walls,

1981
01:46:07,628 --> 01:46:10,635
we'd have a splendid place to live up there.

1982
01:46:10,668 --> 01:46:13,003
With Mrs. Green's consent, that is.

1983
01:46:13,036 --> 01:46:15,820
She has no objections at all.

1984
01:46:15,851 --> 01:46:18,219
If it's done at our own expense.

1985
01:46:19,339 --> 01:46:22,219
Once done, we'd pay less rent.

1986
01:46:22,251 --> 01:46:24,235
Big savings over the years.

1987
01:46:24,268 --> 01:46:26,155
It's a rule of capitalism,

1988
01:46:26,188 --> 01:46:27,659
spend money to save money.

1989
01:46:27,692 --> 01:46:31,115
That's what Mr. Schneider was
explaining to me just the other day.

1990
01:46:31,147 --> 01:46:32,844
Quite an interesting chap, Schneider.

1991
01:46:32,875 --> 01:46:35,211
What do you know about Trotsky, Doctor?

1992
01:46:36,299 --> 01:46:38,027
Early Bolshevik, I believe.

1993
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,747
The great revolutionary of our time.

1994
01:46:40,780 --> 01:46:42,123
If he was in the Russian saddle,

1995
01:46:42,156 --> 01:46:45,036
there'd be no Hitler-Stalin
pact laying open all of Europe

1996
01:46:45,067 --> 01:46:47,179
to Hitler's bloody, fascist armies.

1997
01:46:49,451 --> 01:46:52,587
Permanent revolution is the
only road to socialism.

1998
01:46:52,619 --> 01:46:55,787
This top-floor conversion would
be pretty expensive, wouldn't it?

1999
01:46:55,819 --> 01:46:58,859
Not at all, I'm an architect by profession.

2000
01:46:58,891 --> 01:47:01,004
You needn't worry about
your privacy, my dear.

2001
01:47:01,035 --> 01:47:02,992
You can entertain up there
just as much as you like.

2002
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:06,635
In fact, I shall insist upon
it for my own selfish reasons.

2003
01:47:07,755 --> 01:47:10,027
It's time you had a husband, my dear.

2004
01:47:10,059 --> 01:47:12,971
I need a son-in-law to take
care of me in my old age.

2005
01:47:14,411 --> 01:47:16,619
And you can keep a spare room for me.

2006
01:47:17,867 --> 01:47:20,459
And you can take me as a tax deduction.

2007
01:47:21,387 --> 01:47:23,339
Fall to, Doctor.

2008
01:47:23,371 --> 01:47:25,579
It's hard for him to grasp
what being poor means.

2009
01:47:25,611 --> 01:47:28,107
Polly, stop fooling yourself.
He's way up on the manic curve.

2010
01:47:28,139 --> 01:47:30,635
The next stage could be
an outbreak of violence.

2011
01:47:30,667 --> 01:47:32,459
There never was any question of violence.

2012
01:47:32,491 --> 01:47:34,219
Otherwise, they wouldn't
have let him out of Riggs.

2013
01:47:34,250 --> 01:47:36,075
Nonsense. He was let out of Riggs, no doubt,

2014
01:47:36,107 --> 01:47:39,019
because you didn't have enough
money to keep him there.

2015
01:47:39,050 --> 01:47:41,259
I don't mean physical violence, necessarily,

2016
01:47:41,291 --> 01:47:42,699
there are other kinds.

2017
01:47:42,731 --> 01:47:44,106
These manic sprees, for instance,

2018
01:47:44,139 --> 01:47:47,338
can ruin your life if you don't
control them, starting right now.

2019
01:47:47,371 --> 01:47:48,779
If you give him a household allowance,

2020
01:47:48,811 --> 01:47:50,507
see that he keeps within it.

2021
01:47:50,539 --> 01:47:53,163
Warn trades people against
giving him credit.

2022
01:47:53,195 --> 01:47:55,403
And as far as things like this
top floor job are concerned,

2023
01:47:55,435 --> 01:47:57,675
you simply got to put your foot down.

2024
01:47:58,539 --> 01:47:59,498
Naturally.

2025
01:48:04,107 --> 01:48:07,179
Okay. Take your jacket off,
you're just in time.

2026
01:48:10,378 --> 01:48:12,427
You could have knocked Kay
down with a feather.

2027
01:48:12,458 --> 01:48:14,474
A veritable penthouse, my dear.

2028
01:48:15,338 --> 01:48:17,483
What'll Polly do for money?

2029
01:48:17,514 --> 01:48:20,075
He hasn't a <i>sou</i> and on
her pathetic salary...

2030
01:48:20,107 --> 01:48:21,898
Libby, listen.

2031
01:48:21,931 --> 01:48:24,395
Attention, Department of Census,

2032
01:48:24,426 --> 01:48:26,667
born to Dottie Renfrew,
Latham, a boy, her second.

2033
01:48:26,698 --> 01:48:28,426
Give me something cute to tack on.

2034
01:48:29,738 --> 01:48:32,075
I'm appalled by all this vulgar breeding.

2035
01:48:32,106 --> 01:48:33,803
And Pokey about to pop again?

2036
01:48:34,954 --> 01:48:37,547
Well, it's ideal for that lazy sow.

2037
01:48:37,578 --> 01:48:39,754
All she has to do is lie down.

2038
01:48:39,786 --> 01:48:41,354
Pokey.

2039
01:48:41,387 --> 01:48:42,955
Well, just a sec...

2040
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:45,227
No! When?

2041
01:48:46,347 --> 01:48:48,042
Twin girls again. Last night.

2042
01:48:48,074 --> 01:48:50,475
That's wonderful, Pokey!

2043
01:48:50,506 --> 01:48:52,938
Whatever they cost, Libby, silver
baby spoons to all of them,

2044
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:55,339
I can't be bothered.
Don't you read the papers?

2045
01:48:55,370 --> 01:48:57,578
German army attacks Poland.

2046
01:48:57,611 --> 01:48:59,242
England and France will be in it.

2047
01:48:59,275 --> 01:49:01,962
Frightful. <i>Why doesn't Lakey come home?</i>

2048
01:49:01,994 --> 01:49:04,394
She's gonna be trapped over there.
Haven't her parents any sense?

2049
01:49:04,427 --> 01:49:06,794
So it's silver spoons?

2050
01:49:06,826 --> 01:49:09,643
<i>And, Libby, I am not asking Polly
to contribute. She can't afford it.</i>

2051
01:49:09,674 --> 01:49:11,786
Well, that's it, Libby. Goodbye.

2052
01:49:16,490 --> 01:49:18,027
Hello. Where've you been?

2053
01:49:19,466 --> 01:49:22,762
Very busy for one thing.
Everything is just fine, you know.

2054
01:49:22,794 --> 01:49:25,002
My father's still puttering
around in the top floor.

2055
01:49:25,034 --> 01:49:27,082
It's wonderful therapy for him.

2056
01:49:27,114 --> 01:49:28,939
He asked for you, by the way.

2057
01:49:28,970 --> 01:49:32,458
He might be having another simple
dinner almost any day now.

2058
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:48,010
How's that?

2059
01:49:49,514 --> 01:49:50,698
Awfully big, isn't it?

2060
01:49:50,730 --> 01:49:52,362
The only way a roast cooks properly.

2061
01:49:52,394 --> 01:49:55,946
It will be delicious cold. Enough for days.

2062
01:49:55,978 --> 01:49:58,122
I wonder you had the money
so near the end of the week.

2063
01:49:58,154 --> 01:49:59,466
I didn't.

2064
01:49:59,498 --> 01:50:02,826
But with my honest face, no
trouble, got a little credit.

2065
01:50:02,858 --> 01:50:04,650
I had a brainstorm today.

2066
01:50:11,337 --> 01:50:13,098
What would you say to a
little greenhouse up here?

2067
01:50:13,130 --> 01:50:14,602
Simplest thing in the world.

2068
01:50:14,634 --> 01:50:16,618
Just knock a door through here and
move right out on to the road.

2069
01:50:16,650 --> 01:50:18,602
Costs nothing to build.
A few pennies for glass.

2070
01:50:18,634 --> 01:50:20,937
Don't you think we ought
to get settled first?

2071
01:50:20,970 --> 01:50:23,306
Quite agree.

2072
01:50:23,338 --> 01:50:26,026
There's no harm in drawing up
a few plans, is there?

2073
01:50:30,506 --> 01:50:31,849
Helena called.

2074
01:50:32,906 --> 01:50:34,794
Great excitement.

2075
01:50:34,826 --> 01:50:36,746
It seems Lakey's coming home.

2076
01:50:36,778 --> 01:50:39,754
Really? She's sailing in a few weeks.

2077
01:50:39,785 --> 01:50:43,114
I have to talk to her, Father,
I'll just be a minute.

2078
01:50:43,146 --> 01:50:45,066
And Dottie's in Bermuda.

2079
01:50:45,097 --> 01:50:47,850
And she's coming up. And
all sorts of excitement.

2080
01:50:50,378 --> 01:50:51,946
There she is.

2081
01:50:51,978 --> 01:50:54,857
- Lakey!
- Lakey!

2082
01:50:55,849 --> 01:50:57,417
Lakey!

2083
01:51:02,473 --> 01:51:04,234
So good to see you.

2084
01:51:12,298 --> 01:51:14,313
How did you remember!

2085
01:51:18,793 --> 01:51:20,617
This is Mommy's friend from Europe.

2086
01:51:24,746 --> 01:51:28,713
Girls, the Baroness d'Etienne.
Maria, my South Tower family.

2087
01:51:30,409 --> 01:51:31,977
How do you do? Hello.

2088
01:51:33,034 --> 01:51:34,890
How do you do? How do you do?

2089
01:51:36,553 --> 01:51:38,601
Lakey, I've reserved a
room at the Plaza for you.

2090
01:51:38,634 --> 01:51:39,946
In case you haven't reserved one.

2091
01:51:39,977 --> 01:51:41,993
Yeah, and two cars, mine and Dottie's.

2092
01:51:42,026 --> 01:51:44,906
That's very sweet, but Maria's
taken care of all that.

2093
01:51:44,937 --> 01:51:47,434
The car is arranged. Thank you.

2094
01:51:47,465 --> 01:51:49,833
We are driving to Connecticut immediately.

2095
01:51:49,865 --> 01:51:53,033
I have taken a house there.
Something very quiet.

2096
01:51:53,065 --> 01:51:54,825
Come, darling. The luggage.

2097
01:51:56,585 --> 01:52:00,361
Twenty-two pieces of luggage,
time for a nice long visit.

2098
01:52:00,393 --> 01:52:02,025
Can I have her, please?

2099
01:52:03,433 --> 01:52:05,193
Don't cry. This is Mommy's friend.

2100
01:52:06,665 --> 01:52:09,577
Well, more beautiful if anything.

2101
01:52:09,609 --> 01:52:11,657
Otherwise, the same old Lakey.

2102
01:52:11,689 --> 01:52:13,641
She's much more assured in a way.

2103
01:52:13,673 --> 01:52:17,001
Why not? Six years of palazzi
and important people.

2104
01:52:17,033 --> 01:52:19,561
Baronesses, no less.

2105
01:52:19,593 --> 01:52:22,633
That dame must tote
a pair of brass knuckles.

2106
01:52:26,057 --> 01:52:27,977
Priss.

2107
01:52:28,009 --> 01:52:31,081
How is Stephen? I was hoping that
you would bring him to the ship.

2108
01:52:31,113 --> 01:52:35,081
Well, I couldn't risk it, frankly.

2109
01:52:35,113 --> 01:52:37,417
We're having a toilet training problem.

2110
01:52:38,025 --> 01:52:39,337
Which number?

2111
01:52:39,369 --> 01:52:40,937
What?

2112
01:52:42,664 --> 01:52:45,544
Well, a pediatrician around the
house doesn't help, I imagine.

2113
01:52:46,697 --> 01:52:48,969
One as opinionated as Sloan, anyway.

2114
01:52:50,153 --> 01:52:52,105
How long are you staying, Dottie?

2115
01:52:52,137 --> 01:52:54,280
I'm going right back to Bermuda.

2116
01:52:54,313 --> 01:52:57,160
Brook is there. But we're coming
east this summer with the children.

2117
01:52:57,193 --> 01:53:00,456
Isn't it odd? Lakey's
parents not meeting her.

2118
01:53:00,489 --> 01:53:02,953
And no mention of Chicago.

2119
01:53:02,985 --> 01:53:04,617
Just straight off to Connecticut.

2120
01:53:04,648 --> 01:53:08,041
Well, they've been abroad
to see her several times.

2121
01:53:08,073 --> 01:53:10,089
And got a whiff of the Baroness.

2122
01:53:13,417 --> 01:53:17,736
Has it ever occurred to you, girls, that
we used to parade around like that?

2123
01:53:17,769 --> 01:53:19,593
That's disgusting, Libby.

2124
01:53:21,224 --> 01:53:23,944
What's disgusting about the truth?

2125
01:53:23,977 --> 01:53:25,864
I tell you what's disgusting.

2126
01:53:25,897 --> 01:53:29,096
She and the Baroness couldn't
care less about the war.

2127
01:53:29,129 --> 01:53:33,896
Anti-fascist, of course, but only because
it'd disturb their little nest in Venice.

2128
01:53:35,016 --> 01:53:37,417
You're no better, all of you.

2129
01:53:37,448 --> 01:53:39,976
Chit-chatting. Approving
lend-lease to England,

2130
01:53:40,008 --> 01:53:42,440
and just dusting your hands off.

2131
01:53:42,473 --> 01:53:44,233
As if you have no moral stake in this war.

2132
01:53:44,264 --> 01:53:46,505
As if it wasn't coming right at you.

2133
01:53:51,944 --> 01:53:53,897
Well, I spoke my piece, anyway.

2134
01:53:55,432 --> 01:53:57,352
I've gotta get back.
Is anyone coming my way?

2135
01:53:57,385 --> 01:53:59,913
Sorry, I'm going across town.

2136
01:53:59,944 --> 01:54:01,673
I'm taking the subway.

2137
01:54:01,704 --> 01:54:03,400
So long, Poke.

2138
01:54:03,432 --> 01:54:04,616
Listen, I'll take you up on that weekend

2139
01:54:04,649 --> 01:54:07,400
just as soon as Harald
ties up this new play.

2140
01:54:07,433 --> 01:54:09,416
Dottie, I feel dreadful about tonight.

2141
01:54:09,448 --> 01:54:11,433
Really, I'm so sorry you can't stay over,

2142
01:54:11,464 --> 01:54:13,961
but Harald and I have
had this date for weeks.

2143
01:54:13,992 --> 01:54:16,200
Well, that's all right, Kay.
Perhaps during the summer.

2144
01:54:16,233 --> 01:54:17,545
Yes. Goodbye.

2145
01:54:22,184 --> 01:54:23,176
What's hit her?

2146
01:54:23,208 --> 01:54:25,160
An early nervous breakdown.

2147
01:54:25,192 --> 01:54:27,112
Nothing serious.

2148
01:54:27,145 --> 01:54:29,576
She's a bit feverish on the war, isn't she?

2149
01:54:29,608 --> 01:54:30,824
Overworked, I think.

2150
01:54:30,856 --> 01:54:35,304
Yes, trying to keep up with that
master of unproduced plays.

2151
01:54:35,336 --> 01:54:37,832
And either she doesn't know
he's playing around,

2152
01:54:37,864 --> 01:54:41,064
or doesn't want to know.
She's so dominated by him.

2153
01:54:41,096 --> 01:54:44,040
And that big date, by the way,

2154
01:54:44,072 --> 01:54:46,280
is a poker game.

2155
01:54:46,312 --> 01:54:48,840
That's the set they're
traveling in these days.

2156
01:54:48,872 --> 01:54:50,184
Coming, Polly?

2157
01:54:51,528 --> 01:54:53,000
Bye, I'll see you all at dinner.

2158
01:54:53,032 --> 01:54:54,504
Bye.

2159
01:54:54,536 --> 01:54:56,872
Come along, darling, I'll
drop you "somewhere quiet"

2160
01:54:56,904 --> 01:54:58,472
like the subway.

2161
01:55:09,287 --> 01:55:11,176
Well, Libby stayed the same.

2162
01:55:11,207 --> 01:55:13,032
Maybe a little bitchier.

2163
01:55:19,048 --> 01:55:21,576
Is Polly's life as tragic as Libby says?

2164
01:55:30,407 --> 01:55:31,688
Miss Andrews?

2165
01:55:33,447 --> 01:55:36,488
When you're through here,
can I see you in my office?

2166
01:55:41,608 --> 01:55:42,984
What do you think you're doing?

2167
01:55:43,016 --> 01:55:45,704
Giving blood. Doesn't everybody?

2168
01:55:45,736 --> 01:55:47,176
You'll pardon my research into the matter.

2169
01:55:47,208 --> 01:55:48,584
You didn't give. You asked to be paid,

2170
01:55:48,616 --> 01:55:50,760
and this is the fourth time in four weeks.

2171
01:55:50,792 --> 01:55:52,391
It's Christmas.

2172
01:55:52,424 --> 01:55:54,536
You see, I wanted some extra money.

2173
01:55:56,935 --> 01:55:58,888
What's he building now, Polly?

2174
01:56:01,256 --> 01:56:02,951
A little greenhouse.

2175
01:56:04,167 --> 01:56:06,024
Don't you think you ought to commit him?

2176
01:56:06,056 --> 01:56:07,432
No, I don't.

2177
01:56:08,552 --> 01:56:10,183
Polly, you're playing a dangerous game.

2178
01:56:10,216 --> 01:56:12,263
My father is not dangerous.
You leave him alone.

2179
01:56:12,295 --> 01:56:14,664
You said yourself he may
spontaneously recover.

2180
01:56:14,696 --> 01:56:16,680
I also said he might get worse.

2181
01:56:16,711 --> 01:56:20,455
What do you call this, giving
your lifeblood for him?

2182
01:56:20,487 --> 01:56:22,823
You're a little melodramatic, aren't you?

2183
01:56:22,855 --> 01:56:25,160
You're obsessed, Polly.

2184
01:56:25,191 --> 01:56:27,655
All right, I'm obsessed. I have a...

2185
01:56:28,552 --> 01:56:30,663
Father complex.

2186
01:56:30,695 --> 01:56:32,871
You have nothing of the kind,
and I'm not a Freudian.

2187
01:56:32,904 --> 01:56:36,744
You feel protective toward him.
He's your child in a sense.

2188
01:56:36,775 --> 01:56:40,711
And that comes, perhaps, of your not
having any children of your own.

2189
01:56:40,743 --> 01:56:41,863
I'm sorry.

2190
01:56:43,304 --> 01:56:45,480
Nothing turns out right. I just...

2191
01:56:45,511 --> 01:56:49,351
I just don't face facts in the beginning.
That's my problem.

2192
01:56:49,383 --> 01:56:51,303
That's what happened...

2193
01:56:54,024 --> 01:56:55,623
I had a love affair.

2194
01:56:57,575 --> 01:56:59,143
And I knew.

2195
01:56:59,176 --> 01:57:02,343
I knew in the beginning he'd never marry me.

2196
01:57:02,375 --> 01:57:05,415
When my father came, I thought
I had a purpose in life.

2197
01:57:17,351 --> 01:57:18,759
For heaven's sake.

2198
01:57:18,791 --> 01:57:20,455
This love affair. He still on your mind?

2199
01:57:20,487 --> 01:57:21,447
No.

2200
01:57:22,983 --> 01:57:25,735
The way it ended, I realized
he was just ordinary.

2201
01:57:27,815 --> 01:57:30,535
Well, suppose somebody comes along
who isn't, and you both wanna marry.

2202
01:57:30,567 --> 01:57:32,071
What will you do with your father then?

2203
01:57:32,103 --> 01:57:34,119
I can't marry.

2204
01:57:34,151 --> 01:57:36,103
There has been a lot of
inbreeding in the family.

2205
01:57:36,135 --> 01:57:39,015
The blood of the Andrews is running thin.

2206
01:57:39,046 --> 01:57:41,222
Blood of the Andrews?

2207
01:57:41,255 --> 01:57:42,855
Thick enough to sell.

2208
01:57:45,095 --> 01:57:47,623
I have confidence in it. Will you marry me?

2209
01:57:49,031 --> 01:57:50,663
Very funny.

2210
01:57:50,695 --> 01:57:54,375
Would you like a day to think it over,
or shall we go straight to a hotel?

2211
01:57:56,007 --> 01:57:57,831
Let's have dinner first.

2212
01:57:59,431 --> 01:58:02,215
Call your father and tell him
you'll be home very late.

2213
01:58:02,246 --> 01:58:03,558
In case you think I'm a fast worker,

2214
01:58:03,591 --> 01:58:04,903
I have never told a woman I loved her

2215
01:58:04,935 --> 01:58:07,238
or signed love to a letter
except to my folks.

2216
01:58:07,271 --> 01:58:08,870
And I'm over 30 years old.

2217
01:58:08,903 --> 01:58:11,879
Naturally, now that something has
hit me, I can't waste any time.

2218
01:58:11,911 --> 01:58:13,895
Just when were you hit, exactly.

2219
01:58:13,927 --> 01:58:16,519
About two hours ago.

2220
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:20,934
And five or six years. I picked you out
when you first came to the hospital.

2221
01:58:20,967 --> 01:58:22,375
Well, I'm very sorry, James,

2222
01:58:22,406 --> 01:58:24,934
but if I were to marry, I would
never marry a psychiatrist.

2223
01:58:24,967 --> 01:58:28,295
Good, I'm getting out. I'm leaving
the hospital the first of June.

2224
01:58:28,326 --> 01:58:30,534
What are you going to do? Research.

2225
01:58:30,567 --> 01:58:32,454
There are discovers to be made
in treating mental illness,

2226
01:58:32,487 --> 01:58:34,151
but they won't come from
putting people on couches.

2227
01:58:34,182 --> 01:58:36,423
They'll come from the laboratory.
Brain chemistry.

2228
01:58:36,454 --> 01:58:38,343
I have a job lined up with a research team.

2229
01:58:38,374 --> 01:58:41,062
You can work with us as a technician.

2230
01:58:41,094 --> 01:58:44,294
Well, there's no future in metabolism tests.
How about it?

2231
01:58:45,254 --> 01:58:46,887
You're fast tonight.

2232
01:58:51,943 --> 01:58:54,023
What attracted you about mental illness?

2233
01:58:54,054 --> 01:58:55,879
The waste of human resources.

2234
01:58:55,910 --> 01:58:57,863
And I have a bit of a do-gooder in me

2235
01:58:57,894 --> 01:58:59,302
I think that I come by naturally.

2236
01:58:59,334 --> 01:59:01,895
My father is a minister. Presbyterian.

2237
01:59:03,590 --> 01:59:06,630
He can marry us, if you like.
It won't cost a cent.

2238
01:59:06,662 --> 01:59:08,230
After we commit my father?

2239
01:59:08,263 --> 01:59:10,022
No.

2240
01:59:10,054 --> 01:59:13,414
No, he can live with us and keep house.

2241
01:59:13,446 --> 01:59:16,262
I'll use him as a guinea pig
to test out new discoveries.

2242
01:59:16,294 --> 01:59:17,830
He'll be my dowry.

2243
01:59:17,862 --> 01:59:21,190
The fact is, most of our patients
would be better off at home.

2244
01:59:21,222 --> 01:59:23,142
Then why did you say we should commit him?

2245
01:59:23,175 --> 01:59:25,318
To see what you'd say.
It's a doctor's habit.

2246
01:59:25,351 --> 01:59:28,070
I knew you'd say no. You couldn't
possibly distrust your father.

2247
01:59:28,102 --> 01:59:31,142
You're not a distrustful girl.

2248
01:59:31,174 --> 01:59:33,991
You're not even worried about that hotel.

2249
01:59:34,022 --> 01:59:37,831
'Cause you know very well we're gonna
take a nice, long walk instead.

2250
01:59:41,094 --> 01:59:43,302
It was your eyes I noticed first.

2251
01:59:43,334 --> 01:59:46,342
And to think that your father, a
tax deduction, comes with them.

2252
01:59:46,374 --> 01:59:48,550
I'm the luckiest man in the world.

2253
01:59:56,742 --> 01:59:58,278
Hello.

2254
01:59:58,310 --> 02:00:01,830
Polly, I've been calling you for hours.
We had a party.

2255
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:05,510
Harald took someone home hours ago.

2256
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:11,910
Polly, I have to talk to you about
Lakey asking us all up again.

2257
02:00:11,941 --> 02:00:14,758
Frankly, after the last
visit, I loathe the idea.

2258
02:00:14,790 --> 02:00:16,774
That Baroness gives me the willies.

2259
02:00:16,806 --> 02:00:19,590
<i>I just can't get used
to Lakey being that way.</i>

2260
02:00:19,621 --> 02:00:22,597
Well, she got me into the group, remember?

2261
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:26,150
"I had possibility," she said. My God.

2262
02:00:26,182 --> 02:00:29,798
<i>I really called to talk to you about...</i>

2263
02:00:29,829 --> 02:00:32,261
They're organizing civil defense
groups for plane-spotting,

2264
02:00:32,294 --> 02:00:34,054
and I'm joining up.

2265
02:00:34,086 --> 02:00:36,197
<i>Look, long-range bombers are a fact.</i>

2266
02:00:36,230 --> 02:00:39,589
You really ought to join, Polly.

2267
02:00:39,622 --> 02:00:41,770
It's terribly important. You
better think about it, okay?

2268
02:00:43,046 --> 02:00:45,093
I will, Kay.

2269
02:00:45,126 --> 02:00:47,365
Now, let's get some sleep, all right?

2270
02:00:48,006 --> 02:00:49,541
Goodnight, Polly.

2271
02:01:16,806 --> 02:01:17,765
Hi.

2272
02:01:23,493 --> 02:01:24,773
Why aren't you asleep?

2273
02:01:24,805 --> 02:01:26,277
How could I sleep?

2274
02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:29,734
It's 10 minutes to Norine's.
You've been gone two hours.

2275
02:01:33,189 --> 02:01:37,029
If it's any of your business, I
stopped by Eddie's for a drink.

2276
02:01:37,062 --> 02:01:39,813
That's not true, Harald.
I just called Eddie's.

2277
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:43,141
Yeah, I know.

2278
02:01:43,173 --> 02:01:46,341
I said to say I wasn't there.
Teach you not to snoop.

2279
02:01:51,909 --> 02:01:54,469
Don't lie to me. You've been with Norine.

2280
02:01:59,013 --> 02:02:03,589
I am sick and tired of your
prying, dirty, little mind.

2281
02:02:05,349 --> 02:02:08,133
You sunk so low, you can
suspect your best friend?

2282
02:02:08,165 --> 02:02:11,077
Well, fine. Fine.

2283
02:02:11,109 --> 02:02:12,613
Where are you going?

2284
02:02:12,645 --> 02:02:15,621
I'm going to Norine's.
Have a few hours of peace.

2285
02:02:15,653 --> 02:02:17,989
Harald, please, please don't.

2286
02:02:18,021 --> 02:02:20,741
She'll talk. It's more
disloyal than adultery.

2287
02:02:24,389 --> 02:02:26,181
Yeah, about that.

2288
02:02:30,245 --> 02:02:32,196
No.

2289
02:02:32,229 --> 02:02:35,717
Well, there you are. Look there.

2290
02:02:35,749 --> 02:02:37,509
Look there.

2291
02:02:37,541 --> 02:02:39,589
Harald! No, Harald!

2292
02:02:40,645 --> 02:02:43,364
You bastard!

2293
02:02:59,109 --> 02:03:00,133
All right.

2294
02:03:00,165 --> 02:03:01,893
No! No!

2295
02:03:01,925 --> 02:03:03,076
Okay.

2296
02:03:03,109 --> 02:03:05,157
No! Please, help!

2297
02:03:12,228 --> 02:03:14,309
Well, there you are!

2298
02:03:15,108 --> 02:03:17,445
Harald, please!

2299
02:03:18,948 --> 02:03:20,837
Harald!

2300
02:03:20,868 --> 02:03:23,205
Harald, let me out!

2301
02:03:24,964 --> 02:03:26,724
Harald, please! Harald!

2302
02:03:28,965 --> 02:03:31,141
Refractory. She may not cooperate.

2303
02:03:31,172 --> 02:03:32,613
I know. It's all right.

2304
02:03:32,644 --> 02:03:34,789
Polly, I didn't want you to know.

2305
02:03:37,188 --> 02:03:38,916
What is this place?

2306
02:03:38,948 --> 02:03:40,133
Don't you know?

2307
02:03:40,164 --> 02:03:41,732
Yeah, a mental ward.

2308
02:03:41,765 --> 02:03:43,748
It's the admissions wing, Kay.

2309
02:03:43,781 --> 02:03:46,532
That's what I said.

2310
02:03:46,565 --> 02:03:50,949
The nurses kept saying, "No dear. No,
just a place for nervous people to rest."

2311
02:03:50,980 --> 02:03:53,189
They took away the belt of my robe.

2312
02:03:55,140 --> 02:03:58,341
They wanted to take my wedding
ring, but I wouldn't let them.

2313
02:03:58,372 --> 02:04:02,468
The whole night they kept peering
at me through that peephole.

2314
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:04,676
Judases, they call them.

2315
02:04:04,709 --> 02:04:07,972
Yeah, Harald brought me here and
said it was just a regular hospital.

2316
02:04:08,004 --> 02:04:10,821
Harald brought you here?

2317
02:04:10,852 --> 02:04:13,508
What do they want my wedding ring for?
What do they think I'd do with it?

2318
02:04:13,540 --> 02:04:15,013
Swallow it, Kay.

2319
02:04:16,132 --> 02:04:17,380
It's just routine.

2320
02:04:17,412 --> 02:04:18,501
God.

2321
02:04:18,532 --> 02:04:20,804
Until a psychiatrist sees a patient.

2322
02:04:21,924 --> 02:04:24,932
I saw one last night.

2323
02:04:24,964 --> 02:04:27,588
All he was interested in was my black eye.

2324
02:04:32,132 --> 02:04:33,509
Is it awful?

2325
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:39,108
Of course, Harald signed me in
while I waited in the lobby.

2326
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:41,316
I thought it was odd
that he'd leave without...

2327
02:04:41,348 --> 02:04:43,684
Kay, before that, what happened?

2328
02:04:49,220 --> 02:04:51,204
It was after I talked to you.

2329
02:04:52,324 --> 02:04:54,020
Harald came back.

2330
02:04:56,484 --> 02:04:59,683
We had a terrible fight,
and he locked me in a closet.

2331
02:05:01,988 --> 02:05:03,812
When he let me out, Norine was there.

2332
02:05:03,844 --> 02:05:06,020
He got scared and phoned her.

2333
02:05:07,780 --> 02:05:09,316
After I calmed down,

2334
02:05:09,348 --> 02:05:14,116
Norine suggested that maybe I should
go to the hospital for a rest.

2335
02:05:14,148 --> 02:05:17,508
Did you tell the psychiatrist
all that, how you got your eye?

2336
02:05:17,540 --> 02:05:19,908
Why should he know about Harald and me?

2337
02:05:19,940 --> 02:05:23,396
Don't you see, he could have
assumed it was self-inflicted?

2338
02:05:23,428 --> 02:05:25,155
Look, when you see him this morning, you...

2339
02:05:25,188 --> 02:05:28,100
Look, I don't wanna see a psychiatrist.
I wanna get out of here!

2340
02:05:28,131 --> 02:05:31,108
Kay, that may not be so easy without Harald.

2341
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:32,996
He did commit me, then.

2342
02:05:33,028 --> 02:05:35,555
No. No. But he did give them reasons
to hold you for observation.

2343
02:05:35,588 --> 02:05:38,435
What reasons? He wouldn't dare do that.

2344
02:05:38,468 --> 02:05:41,635
No, there's a mistake, Polly.
Now, you've gotta get him here.

2345
02:05:41,668 --> 02:05:43,012
They won't let me use a phone!

2346
02:05:43,043 --> 02:05:44,932
All right! All right, Kay.

2347
02:05:50,948 --> 02:05:51,908
Hold still.

2348
02:05:53,507 --> 02:05:56,387
Still, Harald never signs anything without

2349
02:05:57,283 --> 02:05:59,236
knowing exactly what it is.

2350
02:05:59,267 --> 02:06:01,572
He prides himself on that. Well, he...

2351
02:06:01,604 --> 02:06:04,452
You just get him here, Polly.

2352
02:06:04,484 --> 02:06:07,459
Kay, it's 6:30. I can't
do anything for hours.

2353
02:06:07,491 --> 02:06:08,900
I promise I'll get him here.

2354
02:06:08,932 --> 02:06:12,995
Now, lie down. I have to
do a metabolism test.

2355
02:06:13,028 --> 02:06:14,756
I haven't had any breakfast.

2356
02:06:14,787 --> 02:06:16,516
It's done before breakfast.

2357
02:06:16,547 --> 02:06:18,371
Now, do as I say. Lie down.

2358
02:06:23,203 --> 02:06:24,643
He'll be here.

2359
02:06:25,764 --> 02:06:27,619
I know what it is.

2360
02:06:29,060 --> 02:06:30,980
It's one of Harald's sardonic jokes.

2361
02:06:47,652 --> 02:06:49,220
You've been hours.

2362
02:06:50,627 --> 02:06:52,195
Where's Harald?

2363
02:06:52,227 --> 02:06:53,859
He's not home, Kay.

2364
02:06:53,891 --> 02:06:54,980
Not home?

2365
02:06:55,011 --> 02:06:56,259
I sent a telegram.

2366
02:06:56,292 --> 02:06:57,891
Well, where is he?

2367
02:06:59,331 --> 02:07:01,348
What does he want? I won't be questioned.

2368
02:07:01,379 --> 02:07:04,355
This is Dr. Ridgeley, Kay.
He's a friend of mine.

2369
02:07:04,387 --> 02:07:08,387
Kay, I've seen the form your husband signed.
It's quite a story.

2370
02:07:08,419 --> 02:07:10,915
You took a knife to him without provocation

2371
02:07:10,947 --> 02:07:14,947
and gave yourself that black eye
while you were locked in the closet.

2372
02:07:16,003 --> 02:07:17,187
God!

2373
02:07:18,307 --> 02:07:21,315
So, we're gonna need his cooperation.

2374
02:07:21,347 --> 02:07:23,299
Well, what if he's run away?

2375
02:07:25,059 --> 02:07:26,947
Look, I'm gonna try to pass you out.

2376
02:07:26,979 --> 02:07:28,163
When most of them are at lunch... Jim.

2377
02:07:28,195 --> 02:07:30,115
You simply walk with me
down the hall to the elevator.

2378
02:07:30,147 --> 02:07:31,907
If we run into a nurse,
I'll have to turn you over.

2379
02:07:31,939 --> 02:07:33,091
If we don't... You could be disqualified.

2380
02:07:33,123 --> 02:07:35,619
I'll simply say I forgot to lock her in.

2381
02:07:40,707 --> 02:07:43,138
No. No, I'm not gonna run away.

2382
02:07:44,291 --> 02:07:47,330
I wanna leave here with flying colors.

2383
02:07:47,363 --> 02:07:49,858
I want Harald to face up.

2384
02:07:49,891 --> 02:07:52,099
I want the hospital to
acknowledge their mistake.

2385
02:07:52,130 --> 02:07:54,147
You don't know hospitals.

2386
02:07:55,107 --> 02:07:57,219
Pal, I won't do it.

2387
02:07:57,251 --> 02:07:59,939
All right. Then you're gonna
have to sit here quietly

2388
02:07:59,970 --> 02:08:02,627
while I send out a police
call for the wandering boy.

2389
02:08:02,659 --> 02:08:06,211
That's the first way to deal with him,
because I think he's a skulking coward.

2390
02:08:06,243 --> 02:08:07,906
Come on, Polly.

2391
02:08:07,939 --> 02:08:10,178
You order a nice lunch for yourself.

2392
02:08:13,443 --> 02:08:16,931
Too confused to be sure of anything.
What gall!

2393
02:08:17,987 --> 02:08:20,034
Yeah, too ashamed to face me.

2394
02:08:20,067 --> 02:08:21,954
Kay, it was at the police station.

2395
02:08:21,987 --> 02:08:23,331
Harald made his statement there.

2396
02:08:23,362 --> 02:08:24,770
He'll be home.

2397
02:08:24,803 --> 02:08:27,362
Very abject with flowers from Goldfarb's.

2398
02:08:28,770 --> 02:08:31,810
But it won't work this time. Not this time.

2399
02:08:49,571 --> 02:08:52,130
I always knew he'd disappear one day.

2400
02:08:55,202 --> 02:08:57,282
Not even take his typewriter.

2401
02:08:59,202 --> 02:09:01,666
Just submerged like a submarine.

2402
02:09:01,699 --> 02:09:04,098
Kay, why don't you stay with me tonight?

2403
02:09:05,539 --> 02:09:07,170
No.

2404
02:09:07,203 --> 02:09:09,987
I've got to get this place cleaned up.

2405
02:09:10,691 --> 02:09:12,450
It can look so pretty.

2406
02:09:15,491 --> 02:09:17,538
You were wonderful, both of you.

2407
02:09:18,562 --> 02:09:20,226
I hope Norine phoned the store.

2408
02:09:20,258 --> 02:09:22,498
She promised to, to say I was ill.

2409
02:09:22,530 --> 02:09:25,666
Please, don't wait.

2410
02:09:25,699 --> 02:09:28,579
Kay, why not take a few weeks off?
Clear out of the city?

2411
02:09:28,610 --> 02:09:30,626
Why not go home for a visit?

2412
02:09:32,930 --> 02:09:36,194
I couldn't do that.

2413
02:09:36,226 --> 02:09:39,778
If Dad were to find out, that would kill him.
He worships Harald.

2414
02:09:42,722 --> 02:09:45,730
Harald is a genius. If you knew the theater!

2415
02:09:45,762 --> 02:09:49,090
Okay, there's one point at which
I do question your sanity.

2416
02:09:50,530 --> 02:09:52,514
Harald.

2417
02:09:52,546 --> 02:09:55,010
Isn't your marriage a sort of fish story?

2418
02:09:56,321 --> 02:09:58,018
How did you guess?

2419
02:10:02,850 --> 02:10:06,146
Well, I couldn't admit it was a failure.

2420
02:10:06,177 --> 02:10:08,738
You know, I'm sort of a legend in Salt Lake.

2421
02:10:09,538 --> 02:10:11,810
The girl who went East,

2422
02:10:11,842 --> 02:10:14,658
exclusive girls' college, and made good.

2423
02:10:14,690 --> 02:10:16,706
Married a man in the theater.

2424
02:10:16,737 --> 02:10:18,978
It's all so glamorous to them.

2425
02:10:21,218 --> 02:10:23,586
So what?

2426
02:10:23,618 --> 02:10:26,626
Failure at marriage, I still
have my own life to live!

2427
02:10:26,658 --> 02:10:29,090
That's more than you can
say about the others.

2428
02:10:29,121 --> 02:10:31,041
Yeah, what's happened to them?

2429
02:10:32,418 --> 02:10:33,890
I hate this place.

2430
02:10:34,658 --> 02:10:36,418
I'm getting out of here.

2431
02:10:37,505 --> 02:10:38,977
Wait for me, Polly.

2432
02:10:43,586 --> 02:10:45,185
I know where I want to be.

2433
02:10:48,129 --> 02:10:49,697
I know where I want to be.

2434
02:10:51,490 --> 02:10:53,473
I know where I want to be. Kay...

2435
02:10:53,506 --> 02:10:55,586
I know where I want to be.

2436
02:10:58,050 --> 02:11:00,097
I know where I want to be.

2437
02:11:02,306 --> 02:11:04,258
And where do you think she went, Priss?

2438
02:11:04,289 --> 02:11:07,009
<i>Back to the scene of college
days, when she belonged.</i>

2439
02:11:07,042 --> 02:11:09,793
The New Weston hotel, dear.

2440
02:11:09,826 --> 02:11:12,737
Present address of Kay Strong, class of '33.

2441
02:11:12,769 --> 02:11:14,753
<i>Got wise to the genius at last,</i>

2442
02:11:14,786 --> 02:11:17,025
who's disappeared, so Norine says.

2443
02:11:17,058 --> 02:11:21,025
As for Kay, she was never happier
in her life, to hear her tell it.

2444
02:11:21,057 --> 02:11:22,945
<i>Very devil-may-care, don't you know?</i>

2445
02:11:22,977 --> 02:11:24,097
I'll call you back, Libby.

2446
02:11:24,641 --> 02:11:27,841
Stephen.

2447
02:11:31,329 --> 02:11:32,801
Well, here's to us.

2448
02:11:35,777 --> 02:11:38,945
A little different from the
last time we were together.

2449
02:11:44,290 --> 02:11:45,665
Seems ages ago.

2450
02:11:47,522 --> 02:11:49,121
I love the view here.

2451
02:11:50,529 --> 02:11:52,321
Perfect for plane-spotting.

2452
02:11:56,449 --> 02:11:59,841
They're having the warmest spring
for years in Europe, you know.

2453
02:12:02,881 --> 02:12:06,369
Perfect for Hitler's tanks, so he could
move earlier than anyone thinks.

2454
02:12:08,929 --> 02:12:10,369
Sit down, please.

2455
02:12:11,969 --> 02:12:14,753
Jim, I'm so pleased you could stop by.

2456
02:12:14,785 --> 02:12:16,705
Well, any friend of Polly's, et cetera.

2457
02:12:16,737 --> 02:12:18,465
That's good, Kay,

2458
02:12:18,497 --> 02:12:21,185
because Jim and I have
decided to become engaged.

2459
02:12:30,369 --> 02:12:33,089
That's... That's wonderful, Polly.

2460
02:12:33,121 --> 02:12:35,425
Polly, you little sneak!

2461
02:12:35,457 --> 02:12:36,896
But you weren't fooling Mother Libby.

2462
02:12:36,929 --> 02:12:39,265
I always said it was
somebody in the hospital.

2463
02:12:39,297 --> 02:12:41,185
<i>And Papa goes back to the farm?</i>

2464
02:12:41,217 --> 02:12:43,329
No. He's going to live with us.

2465
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:46,689
You mustn't, Polly.
Sloan is terribly opposed.

2466
02:12:46,721 --> 02:12:48,737
If you have children, he says...

2467
02:12:49,921 --> 02:12:52,097
Well, what if your father were to...

2468
02:12:52,129 --> 02:12:54,145
Go mad again?

2469
02:12:54,176 --> 02:12:55,777
He did when I was a child, Priss.

2470
02:12:55,809 --> 02:12:58,976
It's a dreadful mistake, Helena.
We've got to talk to Polly.

2471
02:12:59,009 --> 02:13:02,433
<i>It's hard enough to make a go of a
marriage without family living with you.</i>

2472
02:13:02,464 --> 02:13:04,996
Wild horses couldn't have persuaded
Harald to share me with anyone.

2473
02:13:05,025 --> 02:13:06,593
And as for your father living with you,

2474
02:13:06,625 --> 02:13:08,065
if you'd like a minority opinion,

2475
02:13:08,097 --> 02:13:10,656
I think it's marvelous.

2476
02:13:10,689 --> 02:13:13,536
I was thinking, Jim, if I
can manage to stay insane,

2477
02:13:13,569 --> 02:13:15,777
you'll have in me your
own personal guinea pig.

2478
02:13:15,808 --> 02:13:17,409
Or has that occurred to you?

2479
02:13:20,225 --> 02:13:21,281
Excuse me.

2480
02:13:26,049 --> 02:13:28,448
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

2481
02:13:30,304 --> 02:13:32,609
Hello? Hello, Polly.

2482
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:33,632
<i>Dottie!</i>

2483
02:13:33,665 --> 02:13:36,353
Congratulations! It's wonderful news.

2484
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:38,432
Brook and I will be in
New York in two weeks,

2485
02:13:38,465 --> 02:13:40,608
and our party will be the first one.

2486
02:13:40,641 --> 02:13:42,721
Well, folks, gather 'round.

2487
02:13:43,488 --> 02:13:45,793
Folks, a word of welcome.

2488
02:13:45,824 --> 02:13:48,129
Seems Dottie held out on me.

2489
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:51,553
Looks like when I married her, I married
seven other girls at the same time.

2490
02:13:54,081 --> 02:13:55,809
Not bad picking, son?

2491
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:01,057
Seriously, this is a happy occasion,

2492
02:14:01,088 --> 02:14:03,072
with something special to celebrate.

2493
02:14:03,104 --> 02:14:06,912
I'm referring, of course, to the
engagement of Polly and Jim.

2494
02:14:06,944 --> 02:14:09,345
All the happiness in the world to them.

2495
02:14:09,376 --> 02:14:12,704
Thank you very much, but there's
been a slight mistake here.

2496
02:14:12,737 --> 02:14:15,648
Polly and I are no longer engaged.

2497
02:14:15,680 --> 02:14:17,537
We were married this morning at City Hall.

2498
02:14:21,377 --> 02:14:23,649
To Dr. and Mrs. James Ridgeley!

2499
02:14:24,928 --> 02:14:27,680
And the third member of the
household, Mr. Andrews!

2500
02:14:28,544 --> 02:14:30,688
Speech, Father. Thank you.

2501
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:33,888
Well, all I want to say is that contrary
to what some of you may be thinking,

2502
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:35,456
I am not going along on the honeymoon.

2503
02:14:36,896 --> 02:14:40,032
Get a radio in here, right away.
One moment, folks, hold it.

2504
02:14:40,064 --> 02:14:41,856
It just came over the radio.

2505
02:14:41,888 --> 02:14:44,512
Hitler's moved into Holland and Belgium,

2506
02:14:44,544 --> 02:14:46,496
and they're bombing France.

2507
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:47,904
Where would you like the radio?
Put it right over there.

2508
02:14:47,936 --> 02:14:50,048
France? And next, England. Now, now, dear.

2509
02:14:50,080 --> 02:14:53,024
England will never
capitulate, believe you me.

2510
02:14:53,056 --> 02:14:54,688
Where's Kay? This will drive her mad.

2511
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,096
She must be on her way.

2512
02:14:56,128 --> 02:14:58,496
Dottie... Dottie, do you have
a phone I could use, please?

2513
02:14:59,744 --> 02:15:01,408
Yes. Right in this room.

2514
02:15:06,144 --> 02:15:09,824
May I have the... Hello, may I
have the New Weston hotel, please?

2515
02:15:09,856 --> 02:15:12,832
<i>The Netherlands resisted and announced
she was at war with Germany.</i>

2516
02:15:12,864 --> 02:15:15,808
Mrs. Peterson, please, room 2005.

2517
02:15:15,840 --> 02:15:17,952
<i>Germany aircraft when
they appeared simultaneously</i>

2518
02:15:17,984 --> 02:15:20,064
<i>over a score of Netherlands cities.</i>

2519
02:15:20,095 --> 02:15:22,271
<i>Kay, it's Polly. Why aren't you here?</i>

2520
02:15:22,304 --> 02:15:23,935
Wait a minute, I can't hear.

2521
02:15:25,759 --> 02:15:27,264
Polly, you heard?

2522
02:15:27,296 --> 02:15:28,608
<i>Yes, we just heard.</i>

2523
02:15:28,639 --> 02:15:31,296
There's a broadcast from London
in half an hour. Churchill.

2524
02:15:31,328 --> 02:15:34,655
I know. I know, yes. Can you
come here and listen to it?

2525
02:15:34,688 --> 02:15:37,183
Look, it's a matter of days
before we're all in it.

2526
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:39,744
Hitler's not going to wait for us
to arm and declare war on them.

2527
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:42,208
And the Luftwaffe, in one
night, can wipe out New York.

2528
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:45,055
Kay, just get a taxi and come over here.

2529
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:49,024
A plane!

2530
02:15:49,055 --> 02:15:50,656
<i>Wait a minute, Polly.</i> A plane?

2531
02:15:56,735 --> 02:15:57,695
Kay...

2532
02:15:59,296 --> 02:16:00,415
<i>Kay, listen to me.</i>

2533
02:16:02,464 --> 02:16:04,319
<i>German troops landed by parachute...</i>

2534
02:16:08,447 --> 02:16:10,527
Kay's here.

2535
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:13,311
Well, I had no idea. I went to the
mortuary first and they told me.

2536
02:16:14,879 --> 02:16:16,607
Who's up there?

2537
02:16:16,639 --> 02:16:20,191
Polly, Mother and Mrs.
Davison are dressing her.

2538
02:16:20,223 --> 02:16:22,336
Dressing her? Well, why not the undertaker?

2539
02:16:22,367 --> 02:16:23,967
We couldn't leave her with that clammy man

2540
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:27,232
to make her look natural,
with his rouge pots.

2541
02:16:27,263 --> 02:16:31,103
If the ledge and awning
hadn't broken her fall,

2542
02:16:31,135 --> 02:16:33,248
it would have been a basket case.

2543
02:16:33,279 --> 02:16:35,504
We were waiting for you, Libby.
There are things to decide.

2544
02:16:36,224 --> 02:16:38,463
Well, sorry. It's cremation, of course.

2545
02:16:39,039 --> 02:16:39,998
No.

2546
02:16:40,959 --> 02:16:42,463
Burial.

2547
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:43,487
But I thought her father said...

2548
02:16:43,519 --> 02:16:45,247
Helena spoke to him again.

2549
02:16:45,279 --> 02:16:47,904
Kay was always for burial and
a church service. Remember?

2550
02:16:49,887 --> 02:16:52,448
And Libby for cremation.

2551
02:16:52,479 --> 02:16:54,559
Her ashes scattered over New York City.

2552
02:16:55,647 --> 02:16:57,856
Mother settled one thing, Libby.

2553
02:16:57,887 --> 02:17:00,415
It's St. Mark's Chapel
this afternoon at 3:00.

2554
02:17:00,927 --> 02:17:02,047
St. Mark's?

2555
02:17:03,359 --> 02:17:05,951
Where she was married.
She would have liked that.

2556
02:17:05,983 --> 02:17:07,327
This afternoon?

2557
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:09,343
Kay is not embalmed, Libby.

2558
02:17:10,847 --> 02:17:12,671
Well, how can her parents be here?

2559
02:17:12,703 --> 02:17:14,815
They're not coming.

2560
02:17:14,847 --> 02:17:17,503
Dr. Strong was quite bitter,
I'm sorry to say.

2561
02:17:17,535 --> 02:17:19,935
He said Kay belonged
to us more than to them.

2562
02:17:21,215 --> 02:17:23,615
Lakey, may I have the dress, please?

2563
02:17:23,647 --> 02:17:25,055
Bendel.

2564
02:17:25,087 --> 02:17:26,623
It has to be perfect for Kay.

2565
02:17:26,655 --> 02:17:30,175
Don't worry, Libby. We're not chipping in.
Lakey bought it.

2566
02:17:38,942 --> 02:17:43,327
Girls, the casket.

2567
02:17:43,359 --> 02:17:47,455
I... I have to call them. It could be
something simple I saw, but if you don't

2568
02:17:49,727 --> 02:17:54,335
buy something expensive, they look at
you as if you were terribly cheap.

2569
02:17:54,367 --> 02:17:55,935
A simple one, by all means.

2570
02:17:58,494 --> 02:17:59,935
In better taste, certainly.

2571
02:18:02,142 --> 02:18:04,223
Libby's right, as it happens.

2572
02:18:10,399 --> 02:18:11,646
That's that.

2573
02:18:14,014 --> 02:18:16,030
Well, what do we do about a plot?

2574
02:18:16,063 --> 02:18:17,694
Pokey has donated one.

2575
02:18:19,103 --> 02:18:20,959
It's the family plot. It's okay, Libby.

2576
02:18:21,823 --> 02:18:22,814
Fine.

2577
02:18:25,982 --> 02:18:27,679
I hope there'll be no problem.

2578
02:18:30,719 --> 02:18:33,535
I mean, it's church ground, isn't it?

2579
02:18:33,566 --> 02:18:35,646
And with the question of
suicide or not... Libby!

2580
02:18:35,678 --> 02:18:37,470
Well, it is a fact.

2581
02:18:37,502 --> 02:18:39,807
No matter what you tell people,
you can't convince them that...

2582
02:18:39,838 --> 02:18:41,471
I was at the telephone.

2583
02:18:41,502 --> 02:18:45,054
Well, we know that, dear, we know that.

2584
02:18:45,086 --> 02:18:48,382
But even the police, when they found
out she had been in a mental ward...

2585
02:18:51,262 --> 02:18:53,599
It's something I didn't know, by the way.

2586
02:18:54,526 --> 02:18:56,031
Did any of you?

2587
02:18:56,062 --> 02:18:58,366
Anyway, Libby, there's no problem.

2588
02:18:58,398 --> 02:19:00,350
Why, I couldn't be happier, I'm sure.

2589
02:19:00,383 --> 02:19:01,343
Girls.

2590
02:19:03,103 --> 02:19:05,054
People will start coming by 10:00.

2591
02:19:05,086 --> 02:19:06,430
The casket opened or closed?

2592
02:19:06,462 --> 02:19:07,486
Closed.

2593
02:19:10,687 --> 02:19:12,286
And the refreshments?

2594
02:19:13,726 --> 02:19:15,262
Sherry and biscuits?

2595
02:19:17,118 --> 02:19:18,686
Just some sandwiches.

2596
02:19:18,718 --> 02:19:19,774
Open or closed?

2597
02:19:25,343 --> 02:19:27,966
As many as are led by the spirit of God,

2598
02:19:27,998 --> 02:19:29,982
they are the sons of God.

2599
02:19:30,014 --> 02:19:33,822
For ye have not received the
spirit of bondage again to fear,

2600
02:19:33,854 --> 02:19:36,222
but ye have received the spirit of adoption,

2601
02:19:36,254 --> 02:19:39,166
whereby we cry, "Abba! Father!"

2602
02:19:39,198 --> 02:19:41,982
The spirit himself beareth
witness with our spirit

2603
02:19:42,014 --> 02:19:44,286
that we are the children of God,

2604
02:19:44,318 --> 02:19:46,590
and if children, then heirs.

2605
02:19:46,622 --> 02:19:50,014
Heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ.

2606
02:19:50,046 --> 02:19:52,094
If so be that we suffer with him,

2607
02:19:52,126 --> 02:19:55,262
that we may be also glorified together.

2608
02:19:55,294 --> 02:19:58,174
For I reckon that the sufferings
of this present time...

2609
02:19:58,206 --> 02:19:59,805
I love you, Kay... are
not worthy to be compared

2610
02:19:59,838 --> 02:20:00,638
with the glory which shall be revealed...

2611
02:20:01,373 --> 02:20:04,605
Priss! Priss!

2612
02:20:04,638 --> 02:20:07,133
You and Sloan and your mother and Dr.
Garland in the first car.

2613
02:20:07,166 --> 02:20:08,734
Dottie, you and...

2614
02:20:08,766 --> 02:20:10,654
Brook. Brook. Sorry.

2615
02:20:10,686 --> 02:20:15,134
You go along with Pokey and her
husband in the second car.

2616
02:20:15,165 --> 02:20:18,590
Polly, you and Jim and your father, you
go along with Lakey in the third car.

2617
02:20:18,622 --> 02:20:20,990
Helena, I have my own car, thank you.

2618
02:20:21,022 --> 02:20:23,870
Libby... Helena, dear, I can't go.

2619
02:20:23,902 --> 02:20:26,654
I have a terribly important appointment.

2620
02:20:26,685 --> 02:20:30,142
Well, the fact really is that
I just can't take any more.

2621
02:20:30,173 --> 02:20:31,806
It's too shattering.

2622
02:20:35,997 --> 02:20:37,214
Mother.

2623
02:20:47,261 --> 02:20:49,246
Are you going to the cemetery?

2624
02:20:50,174 --> 02:20:51,293
Yes.

2625
02:20:51,326 --> 02:20:53,246
You mind if I come along?

2626
02:20:54,173 --> 02:20:55,518
Get in.

2627
02:21:22,046 --> 02:21:24,157
Who arranged that comedy?

2628
02:21:25,694 --> 02:21:27,229
The funeral?

2629
02:21:27,262 --> 02:21:30,365
Well, what would you have done?

2630
02:21:30,397 --> 02:21:33,629
You can't put a body down the incinerator.

2631
02:21:33,661 --> 02:21:36,829
It's not like a manuscript.

2632
02:21:36,862 --> 02:21:38,397
I heard about that.

2633
02:21:45,405 --> 02:21:47,422
She killed herself, of course.

2634
02:21:48,157 --> 02:21:49,565
Why?

2635
02:21:51,133 --> 02:21:53,021
Sheer competitiveness.

2636
02:21:53,053 --> 02:21:56,317
I used to talk about suicide

2637
02:21:57,693 --> 02:22:01,469
and she decided she could
show me how to do it.

2638
02:22:01,501 --> 02:22:04,285
She could do it better, on the first try.

2639
02:22:07,165 --> 02:22:10,237
Do you think you'll ever
succeed, even in that?

2640
02:22:17,341 --> 02:22:19,773
I never picked you for a Sapphic.

2641
02:22:20,925 --> 02:22:23,645
Or to put it crudely, a lesbo.

2642
02:22:23,677 --> 02:22:26,205
Were you always that way?

2643
02:22:26,877 --> 02:22:28,061
Always.

2644
02:22:33,917 --> 02:22:36,765
You had a regular seraglio up in that tower.

2645
02:22:38,204 --> 02:22:40,445
Were you in love with Kay?

2646
02:22:42,205 --> 02:22:44,253
She was lovely when
I first asked her to join us.

2647
02:22:46,525 --> 02:22:48,060
She was like a wild flower.

2648
02:22:50,205 --> 02:22:53,245
She had a fine, strong back. Tapering waist.

2649
02:22:54,845 --> 02:22:56,348
You're not answering my question.

2650
02:22:56,381 --> 02:22:58,045
You're impertinent.

2651
02:23:01,213 --> 02:23:03,645
Just how close were you and Kay?

2652
02:23:07,964 --> 02:23:09,917
Well, you ought to have asked Kay that.

2653
02:23:11,164 --> 02:23:13,245
You're rotten.

2654
02:23:14,365 --> 02:23:16,860
That's a filthy lesbian trick.

2655
02:23:17,693 --> 02:23:19,836
Spreading slime on that dead girl.

2656
02:23:22,076 --> 02:23:24,508
Let me out of this thing.

2657
02:23:24,540 --> 02:23:26,524
You're not going to the cemetery?

2658
02:23:27,293 --> 02:23:29,117
You bury her.

2659
02:23:30,077 --> 02:23:32,093
You and the group.

2660
02:23:52,156 --> 02:23:55,388
<i>As we the class of '33 go forth,</i>

2661
02:23:55,420 --> 02:23:59,932

02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:14,012

2666
02:24:14,045 --> 02:24:17,948

02:24:17,980 --> 02:24:20,188
