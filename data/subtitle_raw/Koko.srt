1
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,290
- This morning, in judge
Miriam Howard's court house,

2
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,090
very bizarre civil right case will unfold.

3
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,925
A very successful and
educated financial investors,

4
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:40,950
otherwise seemingly normal man,

5
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,713
wants to challenge county's
rules, on marrying his pet dog.

6
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,500
As you can see the protests,
this civil right case

7
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,840
has become a controversial stoop.

8
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,960
Whatever happens, we will see one thing

9
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,780
we would never thought
we would be able to see.

10
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,900
Both straight and gay
marriage activists have United

11
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,683
against

12
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:05,490
- Randy please marry me
instead of Koko, please.

13
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,320
- A young women is even
out here proposing.

14
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,840
We will see what judge Howard thinks

15
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,810
about this strange case.

16
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,110
-  All rise.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,533
Court is now in session.

18
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,440
The honorable Miriam Howard presiding.

19
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,900
- Thank you officer Rice.

20
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,815
Good morning everyone.

21
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:24,982
-  Good morning.

22
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,270
- Today we will hear
arguments in a civil rights

23
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,020
violation case filed by
plaintiff Randy Bobbs,

24
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,320
against the County regarding its arcane

25
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,546
and narrowly minded restrictions

26
00:02:45,546 --> 00:02:48,453
on the definition of marriage.

27
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,290
Mr. Bobbs wants to marry his dog.

28
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,803
Now this one is gonna
take some explaining.

29
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,527
Are you the counsel for Mr. Bobbs,

30
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,453
attorney Michael Curtison?

31
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,120
- Yes, your honor.

32
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,540
Good morning

33
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,210
- Mr. Curtison, I'm surely hoping that,

34
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,913
this isn't some kind of publicity stunt.

35
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,833
Have you seen the mob out there?

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,810
Don't make a mockery of my courtroom.

37
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,600
- No, not at all your honor.

38
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,000
This is my client's life at stake here.

39
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,140
I'll explain how my
client, Mr. Randy Bobbs

40
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,860
has lost so much in his
life, and should be allowed

41
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,930
to marry his true love Koko.

42
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,270
In fact your honor,
before filing this case,

43
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,563
Randy tried to get married at
a church, but he was denied.

44
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,600
- Marriage is the ultimate commitment

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,833
between two living souls.

46
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:48,333
Do you know what it means to get married?

47
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:52,385
Do you know what it means
to get married in a church?

48
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:56,463
It's so much more than two
people falling in love.

49
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,460
It's a decision made
before God and the church.

50
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,320
The two are brought together
for God's Providence

51
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,743
and for God's purpose.

52
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,200
Randy, so good to see you.

53
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,882
- You too.
- I'm glad you came in.

54
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:16,068
And you brought your dog,
what a beautiful animal.

55
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:17,987
Oh my God, I love animals.

56
00:04:17,987 --> 00:04:19,530
How long have you had her?

57
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,790
- We've been together for
a little over six months

58
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,523
but I knew she was the
one, the moment I met her.

59
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,782
- I'm a little confused.

60
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:29,370
Weren't we supposed to meet your fiance?

61
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,580
- She's here, I want to marry Koko.

62
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,890
- Excuse me.

63
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,890
- It's like what you said on the sermon.

64
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,100
The love I have with
her, I wanna celebrate

65
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,420
the highest honor by marriage.

66
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,977
She's loyal to me and she's
faithful to me as I am to her.

67
00:04:49,977 --> 00:04:53,640
That's why I want to marry Koko.

68
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,840
- You didn't hear a word of my sermon.

69
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,710
You didn't understand a word of my sermon.

70
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,057
- No, sir, I did, I completely did.

71
00:05:01,057 --> 00:05:03,750
And I wanna honor the
relationship I have with Koko

72
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,453
through marriage.

73
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:07,800
- You don't marry a dog, it's an animal.

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,810
Human beings don't marry animals.

75
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,130
Where are you getting this?

76
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,560
- She's more than just an animal though.

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,820
She's she's my soulmate.

78
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,373
- No soulmate, that's an animal.

79
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:21,160
You gotta get outta
here, you have to leave.

80
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,020
You're wasting my time.

81
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,110
I don't have time for this.

82
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,943
- But sir...

83
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:25,923
- Look, please, please.

84
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:31,087
- Come on, Koko.

85
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,500
- And Mr. Curtison, just,

86
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,770
how did you come about
representing Mr. Bobbs

87
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,700
in this nobel course?

88
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,810
- Mr. Bobbs and I were college roommates,

89
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,240
during our undergrad years,
we've remained close ever since.

90
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,533
Seen each other through
life's ups and downs.

91
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,780
Randy Bobbs is a normal guy,

92
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,200
but it's important to know
what he has gone through.

93
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,560
I met Randy on the first day of college.

94
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,780
He was moving his boxes,

95
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,870
my parents were moving my boxes,

96
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,563
we were roommates.

97
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,253
- Oh, hi.

98
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,810
- I'm your new roommate.

99
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,882
Oh, hi, I'm Randy Bobbs.

100
00:06:15,882 --> 00:06:18,343
- Michael Dwayne Curtison,
but I go by Mike.

101
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,160
- I was just gonna take this downstairs,

102
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,770
do you need it for yourself or?

103
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,993
- Oh, no thanks.

104
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,570
I wanted to do it myself but,

105
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,820
my dad insist on hiring movers.

106
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,653
- Okay, well.

107
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,203
What side did you want?

108
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:35,510
Cause I I'm good with either.

109
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,343
- Wait.

110
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,680
We can flip a coin.

111
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,150
Heads I win, tails you lose.

112
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,983
Cool?

113
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:44,090
- Wait, what?

114
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,210
-  Just testing to see
if you're paying attention.

115
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,880
- Okay. I'll call it in then.

116
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,713
Tails.

117
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,040
- Your choice.

118
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,120
- So do you always use a
coin to make decisions or?

119
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,170
- It's my lucky coin.

120
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,271
- Okay. And I'll take this side.

121
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:03,104
- Done.

122
00:07:03,104 --> 00:07:05,840
Wanna go grab a pizza?

123
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,143
- Yeah, yeah, let's go for some food.

124
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,263
Oh Mike, this is Ralph.

125
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,040
This is my roommate, Mike.

126
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,980
- Hi Mr. Ralph, I gotta use the restroom.

127
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,820
So I'll meet you down in 15?

128
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,233
- Sure, see you there.

129
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,066
All right.

130
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,853
- If your parents were here
to see you off to college.

131
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,010
Wow, they would be so proud
of the man you've become.

132
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,190
- I'm here because of you, Ralph.

133
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,403
And now is probably the
time to say, thank you.

134
00:07:44,627 --> 00:07:49,270
- Well, that's everything,
have a good semester.

135
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,870
Don't forget, you have a very
busy week in front of you.

136
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,750
- Yeah, I'm excited about
starting work on campus,

137
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,530
you know, between the
job and the scholarship,

138
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,128
I won't have to use any of
the funds my parents left me.

139
00:08:03,128 --> 00:08:07,510
- Sounds like you've became
a bonafide financial advisor.

140
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,510
Okay. Don't let me keep you.

141
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,080
Touch base anytime, anything, you know.

142
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,053
- Thank you.

143
00:08:27,143 --> 00:08:30,607
- Been a pleasure, have fun tonight.

144
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:35,607
- I will.

145
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:56,136
♪ I have started to regret ♪

146
00:08:56,136 --> 00:09:00,499
♪ Every dollar that I have spent ♪

147
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,220
- I like this place, it looks nice.

148
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,053
- The lighting.

149
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:05,730
- I think this is our waitress.

150
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,180
- Hey there, Mike, Randy.

151
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,480
I'm Shauna.

152
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,193
- Wow, you daunt moment there.

153
00:09:12,193 --> 00:09:14,282
- You know that actually happens a lot.

154
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:15,932
What can I get you guys to drink?

155
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,840
- Two light beers, please?

156
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,780
- What?
You're ordering beer?

157
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,330
- Just testing you.

158
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,610
Two coke Shauna.

159
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,230
- Coke it is.

160
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,130
The student's special today is a large

161
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,743
two tropical pizza for 5.99.

162
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,890
- How about pepperoni and mushroom?

163
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:34,306
- Wait, that was gonna be my suggestion.

164
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:37,900
Maybe they pair us up
based on common interests.

165
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,871
I don't remember pizza question though.

166
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:42,877
- I will be back with
your coke guys, okay?

167
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,310
- So Mike, let's start with the basics.

168
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,210
What's your major?

169
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,310
- I was a math nerd in high school

170
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,210
but I did kick ass on the debate team.

171
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,970
My father is a lawyer and
his father was a lawyer

172
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,460
and so forth.

173
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,257
I'm free law, it's in my genetics,

174
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:02,863
then it's off to law school.

175
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,890
I might go on with my dad's firm but,

176
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,683
he does a lot of business
law and corporate stuff.

177
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,280
Not like the stuff you see on TV.

178
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,195
I wanna get out there and
fight for the little guy.

179
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:16,790
You know what I mean?

180
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,840
So what's your story?

181
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,590
- I'm a business finance major.

182
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,760
- You don't talk much, do you Bobbs?

183
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,810
- I say what I need.

184
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,240
I'm sorry, it's just been
really hard for me to open up,

185
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,940
ever since my parents passed away.

186
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,360
- Wow, when did that happen?

187
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,123
- I was eight years old.

188
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,980
My whole family, my
parents, my sister, my dog,

189
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,590
they all died in a
pretty bad car accident.

190
00:10:50,773 --> 00:10:53,209
- I'm sorry if I brought stuff
up that you don't wanna talk

191
00:10:53,209 --> 00:10:55,573
about, we can switch gears if you want to.

192
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,480
- It was a long time ago.

193
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:07,333
- Hey, you guys okay?

194
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:11,643
- Life. Life is hard Shauna.

195
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:14,643
- Yeah. Tropical pizza is coming up.

196
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,470
- Like, I'm not trying to be nosy but,

197
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,230
I thought Ralph was your dad.

198
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,400
Like, who raised you?

199
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,590
Did you grow up in foster homes?

200
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:28,133
- I had to, until Ralph got full custody.

201
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,340
He's a friend of my dad's from the army

202
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,970
and from high school.

203
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,040
- The custody is being
placed to this guardian,

204
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Mr. Ralph Williamson, unto
this minor until his legal age.

205
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:46,903
- Thank you, your honor.

206
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,290
I'm prepared to raise Randy
and provide from a nurturing

207
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,100
and caring environment
for him to grow up in.

208
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,600
His father and I were in the army.

209
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,423
He has no living relatives he can go to.

210
00:12:02,873 --> 00:12:07,140
- Yes Randy, you do want to say something.

211
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,170
- Thank you for letting
me stay with Mr. Ralph.

212
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,123
I don't wanna go back
to foster home anymore.

213
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:15,820
I'll be good, I promise.

214
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,063
- Oh yes, Randy I know you're a good boy.

215
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:24,379
- Mr. Ralph, are you my dad now?

216
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:27,750
- No, but I will be the next best thing.

217
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,790
- He's the next best thing I have,

218
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,700
to still having my real dad.

219
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,550
- That's awesome.

220
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,580
My dad's so busy being a lawyer that,

221
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,830
I just grew up on my own.

222
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,363
- It's cool.

223
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,270
- All right, bon appétit, boys.

224
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,675
There you go.

225
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:48,853
- That's good Shauna.

226
00:12:52,935 --> 00:12:55,440
I caught you looking at Shauna's boobs.

227
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,924
- And then she says, "bon appétit."

228
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:00,464
- And then we both thought
about, bonny Shauna.

229
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,390
Hey, that brings me to my next question.

230
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:05,223
- What?

231
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:06,080
- Gay or straight?

232
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,061
- I didn't really date in high school,

233
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:11,911
but I know I'm not attracted to guys.

234
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,970
I just never been with the girl alone.

235
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,879
- Wait, so you're saying...

236
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,070
- Yeah, yeah, I'm a virgin.

237
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,563
I just didn't see having
sex as a priority.

238
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,130
I had to do well in school

239
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,557
so I can get into a good
university and do my family proud.

240
00:13:33,557 --> 00:13:38,030
There was never time for dates
or to ask girls out or...

241
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,350
Sorry man, I didn't mean
to spill so much on you.

242
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,283
- Well, you don't talk much,
you sure had a lot to say.

243
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,716
I guess he was,

244
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,640
- You are too funny.

245
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,790
- Just testing you man.

246
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,303
To us Bobbs and a hell
of the next four years.

247
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,830
Your honor, Randy was never
good at meeting girls,

248
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,170
but he fell in love with Jessica.

249
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,723
- Hey Jessica, come here.

250
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:19,200
You two don't bite,

251
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,723
So the usual pizza today, huh?

252
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,970
- The name in bold, don't fix it.

253
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,593
Actually, something different sounds nice.

254
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:31,636
- You can try Hawaiian
style, that's my favorite.

255
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:33,420
- Oh yeah, that sounds good.

256
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,760
- All right Randy, shaking it off.

257
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,221
So a Hawaiian with pineapple and ham

258
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:42,721
and two coke, coming right up.

259
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:48,113
- Wait a minute, classy stare, flush face.

260
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,766
- You're turned on by the
new chick, aren't you?

261
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:53,413
- Come on, not funny.

262
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,320
- Do you know her?

263
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,930
Well, does she know you exist,

264
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,183
or is this some distinct
stalker type thing?

265
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,183
- She knows.

266
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,280
- So go talk to her.

267
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,193
- Come on, because, I just
don't wanna break my hopes.

268
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:14,730
- Here you go, you're welcome.

269
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,830
- Hey, where is that new shadow?

270
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,070
- Oh, her training is over,
she's in the back somewhere.

271
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,339
I'll be back with pizza, okay?

272
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:23,330
- I got to go take a leak.

273
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,823
If she comes over here, pull
some balls, talk to her.

274
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,490
Jessica Evans, meet Randy Bobbs.

275
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,370
Randy Bobbs, Jessica.

276
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,380
There you go, hardest part is done.

277
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,300
You two continue, I got to go study

278
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,070
- Here, sit down.

279
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,310
- So last I was here
it was Randy and Mike.

280
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,968
Now we have Randy and Jessica.

281
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:13,071
Man, the world is moving
too fast

282
00:17:13,071 --> 00:17:15,360
- Yeah, it's spinning pretty fast.

283
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,347
Jessica, did you want a coke?

284
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,540
- Yeah sure, that'd be great.

285
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,043
- Yeah here, just take mine.

286
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:24,242
- Aww, sweet.

287
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,383
- Randy, tell me a little bit about you.

288
00:17:32,731 --> 00:17:34,803
- No, I thought you would go first.

289
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,642
I always wondered what
it would be like to hear

290
00:17:36,642 --> 00:17:37,900
the sound of your voice.

291
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,950
- Do you like what you're hearing so far?

292
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,713
- Yes actually, very much.

293
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,400
Your face suit your voice.

294
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:49,883
I don't really know what I mean by that.

295
00:17:49,883 --> 00:17:54,020
See, this is why I want you
to go first and me to listen.

296
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,660
- Okay, okay.

297
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,830
Well, I'm originally from Kansas.

298
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,970
I lived there till I was 13,

299
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,973
and then my dad moved to Indiana.

- I'm so excited to be here,

312
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,575
and thanks for choosing a
dog friendly restaurant.

313
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:28,860
You know I don't go
anywhere without my dog.

314
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,128
- You're crazy.

315
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:31,578
- Oh, you know I love my dog.

316
00:19:32,903 --> 00:19:34,453
- Randy, let's cut the cake.

317
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,560
- First I just wanna say,

318
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,100
how great this birthday is everyone.

319
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,800
And thank you for sharing with me.

320
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,740
These last three years, I can't imagine

321
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,670
what it would be like, without you all.

322
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,660
- Okay, okay, let's dig in.

323
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,493
-  Yeah.

324
00:20:17,864 --> 00:20:19,679
- Great birthday, bro.

325
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,691
We had a great time.

326
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:25,090
- We got to bounce man.

327
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,793
- Yeah, yeah.

328
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:28,970
- Thanks still young Bobbs

329
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,713
- And you need to get rest.

330
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:33,034
It was great seeing you.

331
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:34,130
- You too.
Thanks for come down here.

332
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,410
- No problem.

333
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,110
- So your birthday's not over yet.

334
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,113
- Thanks mike.

335
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,180
- Let's go.
- Bye guys.

336
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,700
- I really hope you enjoyed your birthday

337
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,687
and this is the card I got for you.

338
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:06,420
And we can do whatever
you're comfortable with.

339
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,220
Order room service or...

340
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:29,217
- I'll see y'all later, right?

341
00:21:34,541 --> 00:21:39,541
- So Bobbs, do you feel like a man now?

342
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,090
- If you're somehow
asking about what happened

343
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:45,370
after the party, you
can wonder all you want.

344
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,823
I know, you know what
Jessica wrote in that card.

345
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,293
And besides a real gentleman,
doesn't kiss and tell.

346
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,623
- Wow. Kill joy.

347
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:03,581
- I'm gonna ask Jessica to marry me.

348
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:05,255
- Don't get carried away here, man.

349
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:06,983
- What are you trying to say, man?

350
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:10,630
- I just don't want you to
make a long-term decision

351
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,760
experience in the first act of love.

352
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,333
- I didn't just do it.

353
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,520
In my heart I felt a closeness, a trust.

354
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,420
- That's just the blood rushing
from one head to the next.

355
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,430
- Look man, we're friends and all,

356
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,710
but I don't think I like
what you're trying to say

357
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,563
about Jessica.

358
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,770
- Hold on dude, I'm not saying anything

359
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,520
you shouldn't be thinking yourself.

360
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,030
I know she's your first and all,

361
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,830
she might not be your one and only.

362
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,860
Just make it a long engagement.

363
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,230
- okay. So can you tell
me what we're doing here?

364
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,710
I probably know what you're gonna say.

365
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,543
- You will see.

366
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:27,852
-  Enjoy.

367
00:23:27,852 --> 00:23:28,852
- Thank you.

368
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:31,560
Cheers.

369
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,307
- Randy, are you about to
do anything big and dumb?

370
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:41,853
- Just wait, it's about to start.

371
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,342
Jessica Evans, will you do me
the honor of becoming my wife

372
00:24:02,342 --> 00:24:04,718
for the rest of my life?

373
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:06,135
- Yes, yes Randy.

374
00:24:08,638 --> 00:24:12,856
♪ You know we love each other very much ♪

375
00:24:12,856 --> 00:24:16,340
♪ Sometimes love just gets in the way ♪

376
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,423
- Okay, we have part of the story.

377
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,753
You two graduated together.

378
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,444
Randy got engaged with Jessica.

379
00:24:27,444 --> 00:24:29,420
When are you gonna get more specific

380
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:34,010
and get to the point, at any
time soon now Mr. Curtison,

381
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:35,870
speed this up.

382
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,410
- Yes, your honor.

383
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,313
If you allow me.

384
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,860
So after graduating, Randy
moved up the corporate ladder.

385
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,520
He and Jessica moved into a nice home

386
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,803
in a nice neighborhood.

387
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,850
They were doing very well together.

388
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,070
- I'm so proud of you, Randy.

389
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,143
We could have gone out
to celebrate, you know.

390
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,440
- It's perfect, my lady.

391
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,150
Celebrating another promotion

392
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:08,150
and another raise is best
here, just the two of us.

393
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,083
- Randy, we've been saving
and now you're making more,

394
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,913
does this mean we can finally get married?

395
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,310
- Jessa, I thought we decided to wait

396
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,610
until we can afford the
huge wedding you want.

397
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,773
And after you finish college.

398
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:36,560
- I know, but I can finish
college after we get married

399
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,053
and we can do that now.

400
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,800
It doesn't even have to be a big wedding.

401
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,090
And with this raise we can
go honeymoon in Europe.

402
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,440
- Europe?

403
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,160
- Randy yes, please.

404
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,350
Let's set a date this summer.

405
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,850
You know we can afford it now.

406
00:26:01,613 --> 00:26:04,280
- Well, for you honey, anything.

407
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,710
- Hey Randy, do you know why the boss

408
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,303
is holding a big meeting?

409
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,893
- Not exactly.

410
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:39,100
- Because I'm very scared
and, am I going to get fired?

411
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,540
- No, no, don't worry.

412
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,163
Let's just see what he says.

413
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,643
- Okay. Oh good, because I
really do not want to get fired.

414
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:54,093
Are you coming with me?

415
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:57,343
- You go ahead, I'll be right there.

416
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,430
- Hello executives.

417
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,433
You all know about recent losses.

418
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:29,573
Well, I'm here to share with
you that it's gotten worse.

419
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,853
We have to take drastic cuts now.

420
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:45,487
- Bobbs, you have that
file I asked you about?

421
00:27:45,487 --> 00:27:46,320
Please.

422
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:50,358
Thank you, Bobs.

423
00:27:55,445 --> 00:27:59,140
And let me say on behalf of
the executives assembled today

424
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,653
that you have been an amazing
asset of this company.

425
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,353
We have to cut some positions,

426
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,440
and I trust that you and
everyone else in this room

427
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,683
will be here with us till the end.

428
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:26,483
This plan you've worked
on Bobbs it's a good one.

429
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,210
We'll have to liquidate
assets, employee assets,

430
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:35,780
and severely cut benefit
packages and salary packages.

431
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,130
Even our own.

432
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:40,453
I'm sorry, it's the only way.

433
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:47,350
This company, has weathered worst storms

434
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,983
than this over the years.

435
00:28:50,406 --> 00:28:53,640
I thank you for your
dedication to the company

436
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,313
and your continued dedication.

437
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,260
Thank you all.

438
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,360
That'll be it for now.

439
00:29:10,862 --> 00:29:13,279
- Bye Bobbs, I'm leaving now.

440
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,847
- See you Christina.

441
00:29:17,442 --> 00:29:20,503
- Bobbs, did you get your email?

442
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:26,040
They're cutting my pay
in half, Margaret's too.

443
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,400
- Yes, this sucks.

444
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,500
- They have to, Kelly.

445
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,500
We all have to tighten
our belts around here

446
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,700
otherwise the company will go bankrupt.

447
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,953
- I'm not doing it.

448
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,360
- Like the big guy said,
we can weather this storm.

449
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,725
- Or not.

450
00:29:42,725 --> 00:29:44,717
What about you Bobbs?

451
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:47,030
Are you gonna stick around?

452
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:51,218
I already have a pretty good
standing offer, I can accept.

453
00:29:51,218 --> 00:29:53,094
- I'm going to do redo my resume,

454
00:29:53,094 --> 00:29:55,720
I'm going to look for
better opportunities.

455
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,223
- Hey, hey, this company
has been great to us.

456
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,413
And loyalty works both ways, right?

457
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,586
It may mean some mean
months but the numbers say,

458
00:30:07,586 --> 00:30:09,153
the boss is right.

459
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,410
We all stand to come back
stronger than before.

460
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:17,310
- Jeez Bobbs, I wish I
shared your optimism.

461
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,900
- Don't worry if we just have faith

462
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,400
and let the market do its thing, maybe--

463
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:28,163
- Yeah. Are you gonna explain
it that way to Jessica?

464
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:32,883
- Let's go.

465
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:35,317
-  This is ridiculous.

466
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:10,217
- So it's about work, it's bad.

467
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,923
The company took a huge hit
in the market this week.

468
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,190
All of our money is gone.

469
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,483
- Whose money?

470
00:31:26,381 --> 00:31:29,553
- The firms, our investors, ours.

471
00:31:33,947 --> 00:31:34,780
- My God.

472
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,183
How much?

473
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,363
- How much have we personally lost?

474
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,663
Honey, everything.

475
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,390
And I have to handle a 30% pay cut.

476
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,633
- You mean we have to
handle a 30% pay cut.

477
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,503
- Yes, we have to.

478
00:32:03,061 --> 00:32:05,728
- Can you try to find a new job?

479
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,810
- No, the company will bounce
back better than ever Jess.

480
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,853
I'm sure of it.

481
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,423
We just have to have confidence.

482
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,650
- How long?

483
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,373
A year, more?

484
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,620
- Well realistically, it
could take three to five years

485
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,706
for us to rebuild.

486
00:32:28,706 --> 00:32:31,913
- Randy, I had it all planned out.

487
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,563
We're gonna get married,
honeymoon in Europe.

488
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,540
I was finally gonna be
able to go back to college

489
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,420
and get my degree.

490
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,100
I could finally start my online business.

491
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,253
And now you're telling me
three to five more years.

492
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,300
- Look, I can talk to my boss
tomorrow and I'll get a better

493
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,570
idea of what we're really
dealing with time-wise.

494
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:01,465
But until then, we just
have to have confidence

495
00:33:01,465 --> 00:33:05,120
and then we can have the
wedding of your dreams,

496
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,993
of our dreams.

497
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,080
And you can go back to school.

498
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,633
- Hey Bobbs.

499
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,343
- Hey Kelly, what's going on?

500
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,157
- A few of us are going out
to have a drink after work,

501
00:33:21,157 --> 00:33:22,163
you wanna come?

502
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,923
- Thanks, but I have to pass.

503
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,850
- Jessica didn't he take
the new so well, huh?

504
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,070
- We've had better nights.

505
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:41,860
- I'll talk to you later.
- All right.

506
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:47,873
Hey Mike, I'm glad you called.

507
00:33:47,873 --> 00:33:49,523
I can use a friendly voice today.

508
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,193
- I figured.

509
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,370
I read this morning's news and your firm

510
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,200
is teetering on the brink,

511
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,460
but how are you in a potential Mrs coping?

512
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:03,533
- Well, I could see right now, short term,

513
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,080
things are gonna be tight.

514
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,860
We're gonna have to downsize
to a smaller apartment,

515
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,613
Return one of the lease cars,

516
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,390
no honeymoon in Europe.

517
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,653
She really wanted that.

518
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,930
I'm not even sure when we can afford

519
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,130
any type of wedding now.

520
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,273
- Wow.

521
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,600
Hey Bobbs, I'm sorry about
how, the way things turned out.

522
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,590
- Thanks, Mike.

523
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,087
I'm really looking forward
to seeing you tonight.

524
00:34:35,087 --> 00:34:38,400
All be there in about six, 6:30.

525
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,930
- Sure, I usually get home around six,

526
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,630
and Jessica usually has dinner ready,

527
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:48,630
So I'll have her emotionally
preps for you, hopefully.

528
00:34:48,873 --> 00:34:53,873
And again Mike, no joking
about money or my job.

529
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,983
She grew up without much.

530
00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:00,130
It nearly broke her parents
to get her as far in college

531
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,263
as they could until you
know, their money ran out.

532
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,910
- Okay, okay Bobbs listen,

533
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:10,710
take a chill pill and relax.

534
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,573
Okay. And how about you just
buy Jessica some flowers.

535
00:35:16,813 --> 00:35:18,723
- That's actually a really good idea.

536
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,893
- Randy, Jessica.

537
00:35:24,826 --> 00:35:29,277
You guys, your know
your door's open, right?

538
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,150
Where is Jessica.

539
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,983
- She's gone.

540
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,700
- When is she coming back?

541
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,483
- Never Mike, she left me.

542
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,360
She wrote a letter.

543
00:35:50,327 --> 00:35:52,823
"I'm afraid to restart from scratch,

544
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,443
ruined wedding and honeymoon plans.

545
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:04,830
Afraid of being poor,
lost confidence," in me?

546
00:36:08,288 --> 00:36:09,988
You wanna know what I think, Mike,

547
00:36:12,616 --> 00:36:13,993
She didn't love me,

548
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,043
she loved my money.

549
00:36:20,793 --> 00:36:21,913
Just money.

550
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:27,253
Why didn't I see that?

551
00:36:31,054 --> 00:36:32,093
I'm so stupid.

552
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,993
- Christ, Randy.

553
00:36:47,736 --> 00:36:49,819
I don't know what to say.

554
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:53,940
Don't blame yourself.

555
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,570
There isn't a guy alive who
hasn't been blinded by sex,

556
00:36:58,570 --> 00:36:59,493
even I have.

557
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,737
And you cope well, how is that?

558
00:37:07,241 --> 00:37:12,023
-  cause I'm an
excellent bullshiter.

559
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,400
Dude, I'm scared shitless
of getting hurt or rejected.

560
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,190
That's why I play the fence.

561
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:24,190
I keep my shields up, but you
Bobbs, you're the cool one.

562
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,820
With all the hurt and
pain you've been through,

563
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,977
you were not afraid.

564
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,813
You have no clue how much
respek I have for you bro.

565
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:45,813
- I guess I will have to
put my shields up too.

566
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,723
Thanks man.

567
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,820
You're a good friend.

568
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,300
Actually, you're my best friend, ever.

569
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:18,360
- I can't take credit, one's
best friend is oneself.

570
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,430
Shit, that's cool, why is my phone?

571
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,180
Let me record that before I forget.

572
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,523
One's best friend is oneself.

573
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,923
No, one's best friend is oneself.

574
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,303
One's best friend--

575
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:36,590
- Okay, okay, if all done waxing Socratic,

576
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,773
I would really like to get out of here.

577
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,803
I can still feel her, everywhere.

578
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,073
Let's just go anywhere but here.

579
00:39:32,835 --> 00:39:36,600
-  Hi honey, I'm
calling to say I love you.

580
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,109
Hi honey, I'm calling to say I love you.

581
00:39:42,281 --> 00:39:43,698
- Randy Bobbs.

582
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:46,060
-  Hey Randy, it's me.

583
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,470
- Oh, hi Ralph.

584
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,653
What a nice surprise.

585
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,733
I was gonna call you a little later.

586
00:39:55,554 --> 00:39:58,583
- Tony called me last
night, I'm beyond words.

587
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:01,563
I have an idea of what you're feeling now,

588
00:40:01,563 --> 00:40:03,323
because my wife left me,

589
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,170
but we both know from experience that,

590
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:11,393
you have to just allow time to pass.

591
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,793
- It's funny Ralph,

592
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,283
how Jessica leaving me
when I lost all my money,

593
00:40:20,523 --> 00:40:23,103
it's kind of like when
you got divorced, right?

594
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,563
When your wife left you
after you got injured.

595
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,460
- Well, it's the same in that
neither of us did anything

596
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,890
to mistreat or abuse
or even were unfaithful

597
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:37,656
to the women we loved.

598
00:40:37,656 --> 00:40:41,230
What we have to do is
let it go through this,

599
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,332
you've lost a relationships today

600
00:40:44,332 --> 00:40:49,332
and you should be angry about
it, sad and finally accept it.

601
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,800
- I will need to move
to a smaller apartment,

602
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,963
probably some crappy hole with a wall.

603
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:02,590
Jessica cleaned out the
bank account when she left.

604
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:07,473
So between that and pay cut,
I'll have to live off hotdogs.

605
00:41:09,472 --> 00:41:11,540
- Those are just details Randy,

606
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,060
you've got be better off
when you went through this.

607
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,000
You know I'm here for you.

608
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,070
So if you wanna come home for the weekend,

609
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,816
maybe it's a good idea
to get away for a while.

610
00:41:21,816 --> 00:41:23,580
- I think I'd like that, Ralph.

611
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,413
Thanks.

612
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,283
I feel dead here.

613
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:36,126
I'll call when I'm on my way and Ralph,

614
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,353
-  Yes Randy.

615
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,313
have a big pan of lasagna
ready when I get there.

616
00:41:42,313 --> 00:41:46,330
You bet Randy, safe journey.

617
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,833
Hey and Randy, when you
get here be ready to eat.

618
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:53,090
- Take care Ralph.

619
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,763
Hey Mike, what's up?

620
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,660
- Well actually, a couple of things.

621
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,110
I'm headed to the airport
right now, I'm flying your way.

622
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,303
Be there by 11, can you pick me up?

623
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,790
- Yeah, sure.

624
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:52,064
But, why not rental on waiting?

625
00:42:52,064 --> 00:42:53,509
- Well, because this is a quick spur

626
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:54,600
of the moment kind of thing.

627
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,763
And I wanted to talk to you in person.

628
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:02,930
- Ooh, such intrigue, it
has to be about a girl.

629
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,540
It has to be.

630
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,223
Dude, I'm gonna be a dad.

631
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,863
- Oh, Oh wow, Mike.

632
00:43:13,779 --> 00:43:14,943
Wow.

633
00:43:16,075 --> 00:43:18,870
Just testing you man.

634
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,670
All right, I'll send you over
all my flight information.

635
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,270
- Sure, I'll--

636
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,190
- All right, bye.

637
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:39,040
You wanna sit here?

638
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,873
-  Sure.

639
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,850
- Hey guys. Welcome.

640
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,370
My name is Terry, I'm
gonna be your waitress.

641
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:59,423
These are your menus, do
you want something to drink?

642
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,970
- A couple of soft drinks.

643
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,183
- Yes, I'll be back.

644
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,433
- So What's the big news?

645
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:16,193
- Well, I met someone another
lawyer at a conference.

646
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,280
We're into the same music,
politics, food, movies.

647
00:44:26,438 --> 00:44:27,843
- Here you go, boys.

648
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:31,790
Just to let you know, we're known

649
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:33,270
for the Chilly cheeseburger.

650
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,263
It comes with fries and coleslaw.

651
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:37,880
-  It sounds good to me, Terry.

652
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,716
- Yes?
-  What about you Mike?

653
00:44:39,716 --> 00:44:40,549
-  I'll take one.

654
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:43,063
- That was easy then,
I'll get us started, okay?

655
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,453
- Cheers.

656
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:54,753
To us ever evolving men
and to your new gal.

657
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,183
Y'all live happily ever after.

658
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:01,943
- You're here.

659
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:10,093
- Hey, if you like her so much,

660
00:45:10,093 --> 00:45:12,113
why don't you go talk to her?

661
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:14,252
- What?

662
00:45:15,785 --> 00:45:18,085
- You're obviously
drooling over the brunette.

663
00:45:21,425 --> 00:45:22,650
Hey Terry.

664
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:23,593
- Yes.

665
00:45:23,593 --> 00:45:25,452
- You see that group of ladies over there?

666
00:45:25,452 --> 00:45:26,550
-  Yes.

667
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:29,236
How about you put their
tab on Randy's tab.

668
00:45:29,236 --> 00:45:30,943
I will be glad to.

669
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,330
Which one caught your eye?

670
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:36,280
The Burnett on the right?

671
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,113
- You're sharp, Terry.

672
00:45:38,117 --> 00:45:39,253
- I'll be back, okay?

673
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,690
Hi ladies, I just wanna let you know

674
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:50,930
that those guys over there,
they paid for your dinner.

675
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:54,319
- So are you gonna go talk to them?

676
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:55,900
- Okay, okay.

677
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,750
I know how this works.

678
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,673
I say no but, my best friend
makes it happen anyways.

679
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,390
- Come on, show me how it's done.

680
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,809
- Oh my God, he is coming, he is coming.

681
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:17,990
Shush, don't speak.

682
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:19,069
- Hi ladies.

683
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:19,902
-  Hi.

684
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:20,735
- My name is Randy.

685
00:46:20,735 --> 00:46:21,568
-  Hi Randy

686
00:46:21,568 --> 00:46:22,401
-  Hi Randy.

687
00:46:22,401 --> 00:46:25,000
- We're all veterinarian
techs at the animal shelter.

688
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,510
Tonight we are celebrating.

689
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,600
- That's right.

690
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,300
My incredible staff here and myself,

691
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,040
got all of our dogs back to good health.

692
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,860
No more kennel cough.

693
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,800
That really is something.

694
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,803
I can't imagine what it is
like to see sick animals.

695
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,163
- The worst are the mistreated ones.

696
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:48,560
- It's sad, isn't it?

697
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,010
How someone can take the
devotion of the sweet nature

698
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:56,240
creature and just intentionally
hurt it, I can't imagine.

699
00:46:58,363 --> 00:47:02,320
- Randy, why don't you come
visit us at the animal shelter?

700
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,460
You can see me in the other
angels of mercy in action.

701
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,590
Unless you're busy or you know.

702
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,593
- Well, if you're not busy.

703
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,463
- Well, she wouldn't be, I will see to it.

704
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:17,472
Come by tomorrow around noon, right Randy?

705
00:47:17,472 --> 00:47:18,753
- Yeah, yeah.

706
00:47:21,493 --> 00:47:25,283
Here is my card, just text me the address.

707
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,253
- Yeah, I'll text you.

708
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:30,962
- Great.

709
00:47:30,962 --> 00:47:32,039
It was nice to meet you ladies.

710
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:33,329
-  Nice to meet you Randy.

711
00:47:33,329 --> 00:47:35,250
And thank you for dinner.

712
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,083
- Anytime.

713
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:37,646
- Thank you so much.

714
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,229
-  Bye, have a goodnight.

715
00:47:46,773 --> 00:47:49,080
- So mission accomplished?

716
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,420
- Yes, sir.

717
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,050
I have lunch with her tomorrow.

718
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:52,941
Her supervisor set it up.

719
00:47:52,941 --> 00:47:55,703
They all work at the animal shelter.

720
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,800
- Hi Randy.

721
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,370
That's a very nicely wrapped gift.

722
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,760
I'll go let Trish know that you're here.

723
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:06,700
- Trish?

724
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,563
- Oh, I mean Patricia, she
likes to be called Trish.

725
00:48:09,563 --> 00:48:12,880
I'll let her know that her
steamy man is here for his tour.

726
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,932
- Thank you Manila.

727
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,023
-  Anytime.

728
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,250
- Hi Randy, sorry I'm running late.

729
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,560
- It's okay, I got you this.

730
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,830
- Oh, that was so nice,

731
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:26,780
but you didn't have to do that.

732
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:29,930
- I figured someone around
here could use a special treat.

733
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,242
- That was unexpected of you, Randy.

734
00:48:33,242 --> 00:48:36,424
- I'm sure you have a few
clients that could use a treat.

735
00:48:36,424 --> 00:48:37,537
- Why don't you come on back

736
00:48:37,537 --> 00:48:39,370
and I'll give you the grand tour.

737
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:41,737
- Okay Trish, let's go.

738
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,574
- Sorry, it's so loud in there.

739
00:49:19,574 --> 00:49:22,447
- It's okay, they're just
talking to each other.

740
00:49:22,447 --> 00:49:23,280
- Come on.

741
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,680
This is the office.

742
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:29,930
- It's nice.

743
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,350
- So Peggy said once the tour is over,

744
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,000
if you want, we can go to lunch.

745
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,490
- That sounds nice, I would like that.

746
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:39,743
I mean, if you want to.

747
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:42,223
I guess I didn't properly ask you, did I?

748
00:49:48,203 --> 00:49:50,693
-  Allan, this is Randy.

749
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,290
We're just about to go out to lunch.

750
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,123
What's wrong?

751
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:58,270
- I have tried everything,
nothing seems to make her happy

752
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,870
and she's not eating neither.

753
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:02,590
-  Is it okay to pet him?

754
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,840
- Yeah, of course.

755
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,200
She clearly likes you.

756
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,000
I mean, I couldn't get that
much of a reaction from her.

757
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,623
Peggy, come look at her now.

758
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:17,843
- Wow, that's amazing, Allan.

759
00:50:20,574 --> 00:50:21,975
- What's her name?

760
00:50:21,975 --> 00:50:23,220
- The tag says Koko.

761
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,305
- We just found her sitting
on the back porch steps

762
00:50:25,305 --> 00:50:27,024
a few weeks ago when we opened.

763
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:30,676
- She's a sweet angel and mystery

764
00:50:30,676 --> 00:50:33,550
- Really unresponsive when she came but,

765
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:35,522
we ran all sorts of
tests, nothing was wrong.

766
00:50:35,522 --> 00:50:37,203
We couldn't figure it out.

767
00:50:38,282 --> 00:50:42,186
- Nothing is wrong, you're all right Koko.

768
00:50:42,186 --> 00:50:44,253
- She's a special one.

769
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,160
I think she is here with a purpose.

770
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:50,560
- She's here for me.

771
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,740
I mean, I'm here for her.

772
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:57,213
I mean, I don't know what I mean.

773
00:50:58,544 --> 00:51:01,101
What's the process for me to adopt her?

774
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:06,101
- Well you know, the two
week waiting period is over.

775
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,701
So technically you can adopt her.

776
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:13,073
You can come back this afternoon.

777
00:51:14,831 --> 00:51:15,980
- Come on Koko.

778
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,113
- It's okay, Koko.

779
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,970
You be a good girl, okay?

780
00:51:26,970 --> 00:51:29,370
I'll be right back, I'll be
here to get you, all right.

781
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:30,895
I promise.

782
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:43,492
- So shall we?

783
00:51:43,492 --> 00:51:47,040
- Oh yeah, lunch, right?

784
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,087
Yeah. Let's let's make it quick

785
00:51:48,087 --> 00:51:50,450
so I can get back here to Koko.

786
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:53,510
- Okay. There's a quick soup and sandwich

787
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,216
shop around the corner.

788
00:51:55,216 --> 00:51:57,583

Hey Bob, how are you liking new office

814
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,840
with the big wide open window?

815
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,349
- It's great, thank you.

816
00:53:58,349 --> 00:53:59,182
Though I never really,

817
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:01,390
never really had time
to look out the window.

818
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:03,003
- We all owe all this to you.

819
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,590
- It's not just me,

820
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,500
everyone here has worked
so hard to pull us back

821
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,790
from destruction.

822
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:11,080
- Destruction?

823
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,500
We're doing better than
we've ever done before.

824
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,760
Now we're gonna work on
you, enjoying your life.

825
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,440
You got to get a nicer looking car.

826
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,370
You'd have to get a nicer apartment.

827
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,740
You have to find a girlfriend.

828
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:27,610
- Well actually, I have met someone.

829
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:29,690
- Congratulations. Excellent.

830
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:32,040
And this is for you for your promotion.

831
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,683
- Wow. Thank you.

832
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,270
Brand new laptop Koko.

833
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,513
And this is my third promotion.

834
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,620
Are you proud of me?

835
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:47,283
I know you like your new fancy house.

836
00:54:49,684 --> 00:54:51,103
I love you Koko.

837
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:56,453
I can't explain it, but it
doesn't feel like you're a dog.

838
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:04,153
I sense you, you feel me,
the real me, inside and out.

839
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:06,923
You love me unconditionally.

840
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,180
Ever since I've met you
everything has better.

841
00:55:14,655 --> 00:55:17,313
Losing my parents, losing Jessica,

842
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:20,937
I can finally put all that behind me.

843
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:26,210
You understand, don't you girl?

844
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,140
How can I ever show you
how much you mean to me?

845
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,470
Some day, if I don't
get up to take you out

846
00:55:38,374 --> 00:55:40,343
I may not have gotten up at all.

847
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:44,548
I want to pay you the
highest honor possible,

848
00:55:44,548 --> 00:55:46,433
but how?

849
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:49,240
I don't know yet.

850
00:55:55,315 --> 00:55:58,553
I will, and when I do
you just watch me girl,

851
00:55:59,554 --> 00:56:02,710
it will be a form of tribute
no one will ever forget.

852
00:56:20,367 --> 00:56:21,563
- Hi Randy.

853
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:25,543
Can I come in?

854
00:56:47,014 --> 00:56:49,014
I see you got companion.

855
00:56:52,435 --> 00:56:55,743
And this place is amazing.

856
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:02,360
- Jessica, what did
you want to talk about?

857
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:07,700
- I've just been trying to figure out

858
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,063
a way to apologize for just leaving.

859
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,293
I was terrified of being poor.

860
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:20,840
Not finishing college was hard enough

861
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,173
to cope with as it was.

862
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:26,773
And then when things went South
for you money wise at work,

863
00:57:30,564 --> 00:57:32,660
I just freaked out.

864
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,333
I went home for awhile, but,

865
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:39,477
I couldn't stop thinking about you,

866
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:43,443
about us.

867
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,134
I saw you in the park today,

868
00:57:55,293 --> 00:57:58,323
And it just made me realize
how much I missed you.

869
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:02,820
- I'm stunned, Jessica.

870
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:08,710
I don't even know what to say.

871
00:58:12,336 --> 00:58:14,423
There's someone else in my life now.

872
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,653
Someone who loves me and only me,

873
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:25,206
Who's loyal and wants to be with me,

874
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:27,893
for richer or for poorer, whatever.

875
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,843
I can never trust you again.

876
00:58:36,615 --> 00:58:37,448
I'm sorry.

877
00:58:42,499 --> 00:58:44,853
- Well, I had to try.

878
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:49,550
Are you sure you found the real thing?

879
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:50,383
- I'm sure.

880
00:58:51,867 --> 00:58:56,233
When I'm with her, I feel complete.

881
00:58:57,725 --> 00:59:00,423
I don't know, I just can't explain it.

882
00:59:01,864 --> 00:59:04,277
- You don't have to try, I get it.

883
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:29,610
- You know, I would
rather be having a donut

884
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:30,820
than this orange.

885
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:32,997
My husband never lets
me have a donut at home.

886
00:59:32,997 --> 00:59:35,780
- That's because he wants you
to keep your gorgeous figure.

887
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,800
- Seriously?

888
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,250
- Yeah. And if I had your figure,
I'd be dating every night.

889
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,570
- Really?

890
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:44,320
Okay girls, time to get back to work

891
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,260
and back to washing the doggies.

892
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:49,010
- No, I'm so tired.

893
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,763
- I know. I know.

894
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,360
Okay Trish, spell it.

895
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:03,950
You and Randy have been dating
for over six months now.

896
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:06,470
So where are things at?

897
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,870
You never even talk about it?

898
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:10,160
- I don't know.

899
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,020
It's a bit weird sometimes.

900
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,840
- Weird, why?

901
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:15,348
- He's obsessed with Koko.

902
01:00:15,348 --> 01:00:18,050
It's like everything we
do we have to make sure

903
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,713
it's okay for Koko to come too.

904
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,720
I finally got him to
agree to let my sister

905
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:23,740
watch Koko for the night,

906
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:25,570
but only so that we could go to dinner

907
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:27,470
with his college roommate.

908
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:29,050
- It'll be fine.

909
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:34,050
I think Randy is just having
a little case of puppy love.

910
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:39,370
Just give him some time and space.

911
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,069
He'll come around, I know.

912
01:00:41,069 --> 01:00:42,885
- He's the perfect guy, otherwise.

913
01:00:42,885 --> 01:00:45,000
-  He is.

914
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,740
- At least tonight he'll be
focused on me and not Koko.

915
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:48,573
- Amen.

916
01:00:49,758 --> 01:00:52,783
- When my friend came back,

917
01:00:57,114 --> 01:00:58,697
Bobbs looks at him and he says,

918
01:00:58,697 --> 01:01:01,044
you're wasting your parent's money.

919
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,920
That guy was so mad.

920
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:08,063
- Well, he had about eight beer
bongs and can barely stand.

921
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,793
Truth hurts.

922
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,173
Where is he today?

923
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:14,773
- His parent's basement.

924
01:01:23,463 --> 01:01:25,660
Excuse me, I'm gonna
call and make sure Koko

925
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,110
is okay with your sister.

926
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,940
- Bobbs I don't get to see you much,

927
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:32,600
besides you've got a perfectly
good date sitting here.

928
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,433
Relax.

929
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:37,230
- You're right, I'm sorry guys.

930
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:40,530
It's just, this is the
first time we've been apart

931
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,263
since we met and I'm nervous.

932
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:46,253
- Bobbs, I understand.

933
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,550
I see all over your social media posts.

934
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:53,700
I know what Koko looks
like more than Trish here.

935
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,439
If you love her so much,
why don't you marry Koko?

936
01:01:57,405 --> 01:01:59,723
- Mike please don't give him any ideas.

937
01:02:01,337 --> 01:02:02,423
- I'll be right back.

938
01:02:07,313 --> 01:02:11,704
- Does he really take that
dog everywhere, even to work?

939
01:02:11,704 --> 01:02:15,927
- Yeah, it's that far.

940
01:02:15,927 --> 01:02:19,601
- I don't know if I
should tell you this but,

941
01:02:19,601 --> 01:02:24,080
he lost his entire family
as a kid, even the dog.

942
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:28,363
- He didn't mention a dog when he told me.

943
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,483
-  He has a lot of trust issues.

944
01:02:33,773 --> 01:02:36,313
- We've been dating for six months now.

945
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,600
I kind of think he's the one.

946
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,254
- Really?

947
01:02:41,254 --> 01:02:45,604
- Yeah.

948
01:02:47,477 --> 01:02:50,280
- Everything is okay with Koko.

949
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,350
- And everything's fine here.

950
01:02:53,350 --> 01:02:55,306
Well, we'll have to do this again sometime

951
01:02:55,306 --> 01:02:57,530
when I get back in town.

952
01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:00,383
And hopefully you two
will have news for me.

953
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:02,973
- Maybe I will.

954
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:10,310
- Okay Mr. Curtison, now we have some idea

955
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:13,680
of his mindset and background.

956
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,670
But what was it that
solidified your client's desire

957
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,810
to marry his pet dog?

958
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:22,193
I was just about to finish.

959
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,963
I know you've been very
patient with me thus far.

960
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,633
- Let's hear it.

961
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,830
- That all people should
be treated equally

962
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:50,583
regardless of who they
are or who they love.

963
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:58,090
It's a victory for the allies
and friends and supporters

964
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:02,800
who spent years even
decades working and praying

965
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,160
for change to come.

966
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,280
This morning the Supreme Court recognized

967
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:10,060
that the constitution
guarantees marriage equality

968
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:15,060
and slowly made an entire country realize

969
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:19,010
that love is love.

970
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,760
- Many couples taking
advantage of the rights

971
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,700
they've been granted to
choose their own partner

972
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:28,130
are foregoing the
traditional church ceremony

973
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:31,130
opting instead for a simple civil service.

974
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:33,027
As many faiths have enough--

975
01:04:34,793 --> 01:04:36,043
- Did you hear that girl?

976
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:42,323
With these new laws, we
can marry who we want.

977
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:47,973
- If you love us so much,
why don't you marry Koko?

978
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,260
- Marriage is an ultimate commitment

979
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:54,140
between two living souls.

980
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:57,083
- I didn't even think about it.

981
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:59,183
I didn't even think about a legal wedding.

982
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:09,173
In order to honor you
in the highest regard,

983
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:14,153
Koko, Will you marry me?

984
01:05:14,153 --> 01:05:15,283
Will you marry me?

985
01:05:19,178 --> 01:05:20,043
And it's settled.

986
01:05:21,383 --> 01:05:24,202
We'll head down to the courthouse tomorrow

987
01:05:24,202 --> 01:05:26,093
and get our license.

988
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:32,563
Oh man, I got to call Mike.

989
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:34,727
I got to call Patricia.

990
01:05:34,727 --> 01:05:36,493
They can meet us down there.

991
01:05:54,803 --> 01:05:56,560
Hey Mike, I need you to try to break away

992
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,060
from your conference tomorrow.

993
01:05:59,046 --> 01:06:00,620
I'm gonna be at the courthouse tomorrow

994
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,023
and I need your help.

995
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,297
I have something really
important I need to take care of,

996
01:06:05,297 --> 01:06:06,393
and I need you there.

997
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:08,603
Meet me at ten.

998
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,513
- Hey Randy, what's up?

999
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:29,923
- First, I wanna say I had a
great time the other night.

1000
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,490
You're great company.

1001
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:34,720
Sorry I was so distracted.

1002
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:37,280
- Oh no, it's okay.

1003
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,533
I mean, if I can't understand
puppy love who can, right?

1004
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:42,723
You at work?

1005
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:47,920
- No actually, I took some time off to,

1006
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,290
to think about some things.

1007
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:51,436
- Like what?

1008
01:06:51,436 --> 01:06:54,300
- I'm going down to
the courthouse tomorrow

1009
01:06:54,300 --> 01:06:56,720
and I really want you to be there.

1010
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,774
I have something really special planned

1011
01:06:58,774 --> 01:07:00,953
and I need you to be there.

1012
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:03,983
Can you come?

1013
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:08,173
Yeah sure, if it's that important.

1014
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:11,860
I can get off work, what time?

1015
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:12,693
- At 10.

1016
01:07:13,674 --> 01:07:16,550
- You wanna give me a hint
about what's happening

1017
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:17,663
at the courthouse.

1018
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,563
- No, I'd rather it be a surprise.

1019
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:23,800
You'll understand when you get there,

1020
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,250
and Mike should be there too.

1021
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:29,273
- Okay, I'll be there.

1022
01:07:30,488 --> 01:07:31,570
- Okay, great.

1023
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:32,403
You're the best.

1024
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:36,073
- Okay, bye.

1025
01:07:40,371 --> 01:07:42,407
Oh my God,

1026
01:07:42,407 --> 01:07:45,480
Oh my God, he's gonna propose.

1027
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,170
Oh, I need to do my nails.

1028
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,790
I need to get a new dress.

1029
01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:50,973
Oh my God, he is gonna propose.

1030
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:05,160
Do you think it's too fast?

1031
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:07,200
I mean, I know Randy and
I just started dating

1032
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,700
six months ago, but I'm really excited.

1033
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,110
- You're fine.

1034
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:12,943
- There he is.

1035
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:18,320
- Hey Randy, you can't bring your--

1036
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:20,570
- Yes, can I help you?

1037
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:24,160
Excuse me, sir, I'm sorry,

1038
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,540
but unless that's a
registered service animal

1039
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,510
there are no pets
allowed in this building.

1040
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:30,687
Your dog needs to wait outside.

1041
01:08:30,687 --> 01:08:33,290
- We're here today because,

1042
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:35,647
we're applying for a marriage license.

1043
01:08:35,647 --> 01:08:38,260
And I'm applying with the love of my life.

1044
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:40,820
- Well, that's a very sweet way to propose

1045
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:43,283
but your dog still needs to wait outside.

1046
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:47,260
I don't think you understand.

1047
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,023
I'm here for our license.

1048
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:52,950
- Sir, in order to obtain a dog license

1049
01:08:52,950 --> 01:08:55,862
you don't need to bring
your dog into the building.

1050
01:08:55,862 --> 01:08:58,440
- No, we're not here for a dog license,

1051
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,550
I'm here for a wedding license,

1052
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:04,033
for myself and my bride to be, Koko.

1053
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,250
I don't know what kind of sick joke

1054
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,200
you're trying to pull here, but--

1055
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,213
- It's not a joke.

1056
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:13,060
She's the soul I feel most
connected to in this world.

1057
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:17,130
- Security, I need your help here.

1058
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:22,650
- Okay, what's going on?

1059
01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:27,470
- This nut over here is trying
to obtain a marriage license

1060
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:30,810
for him and his four legged bride.

1061
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:32,689
Would you handle this please?

1062
01:09:32,689 --> 01:09:36,433
- Yes. Sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave now.

1063
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:39,903
Now.

1064
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:43,853
- Excuse me.

1065
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,840
I'm so sorry.

1066
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,673
Randy.

1067
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,173
Randy.

1068
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:53,543
Randy,

1069
01:09:55,577 --> 01:09:58,147
have you lost your beloved mind?

1070
01:09:58,147 --> 01:10:00,509
You can't marry a dog, man.

1071
01:10:00,509 --> 01:10:01,859
Have you flipped out on me?

1072
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:04,123
- Where did Trish go?

1073
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:07,260
- Probably to a bar to get a drink

1074
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:09,460
because of that public humiliation.

1075
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,850
- Public humiliation?

1076
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:12,650
I was the one they were laughing at.

1077
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:17,620
- Jeez man, are you that
blinded by that dog?

1078
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:20,869
Trish thought you were here
to get a license to marry her,

1079
01:10:20,869 --> 01:10:22,313
not Koko.

1080
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,850
You said it be a special day for her.

1081
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,646
- Because she was the one
who brought us together.

1082
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:31,760
I thought she of all
people would understand

1083
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,700
why I was doing what I was
doing and be happy for us.

1084
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,303
I'm sure when I explain it
to her, she'll understand.

1085
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,170
- She'll know more than me.

1086
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:45,150
I feel this connection with Koko,

1087
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:48,370
stronger than anything
else alive in this world.

1088
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:53,100
And I want to honor that bond
in the highest regard possible

1089
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:54,493
and take her as my bride.

1090
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,890
- Randy, I understand everything
you went through as a kid

1091
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:01,340
and everything which you've
lost, including Jessica.

1092
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:05,250
- Jessica opened up my eyes and my heart.

1093
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:07,900
Without her, I would never
have found my way to Koko.

1094
01:11:09,335 --> 01:11:11,685
And besides, aren't you
the civil rights champ?

1095
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,590
Don't I have a right to marry who I want?

1096
01:11:16,885 --> 01:11:20,183
- It's kinda been a debate
about who you came marry,

1097
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:25,020
but a dog, I don't know.

1098
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:25,960
I have to do some research.

1099
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,460
- Help, help me Mike.

1100
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:30,060
Please, help me.

1101
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,460
Help me get married to Koko.

1102
01:11:32,892 --> 01:11:35,590
A marriage license may
just be a piece of paper

1103
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,770
but it would mean everything to me,

1104
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:40,423
if I could show that
we're bonded together.

1105
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:44,833
- You know I'm fresh out
of law school, right?

1106
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:48,940
You really think I can work miracles?

1107
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:51,293
- Yes, I always thought that of you.

1108
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,930
- Okay Randy, call it.

1109
01:11:57,930 --> 01:11:59,580
- You still have that lucky coin?

1110
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,283
Heads.

1111
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:05,463
- Heads it is.

1112
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:12,863
It's like she understands.

1113
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:18,183
- She knows Mike, somehow she knows.

1114
01:12:20,723 --> 01:12:23,640
- Okay Randy, I'll follow the case.

1115
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:46,610
- Mr. Randy Bobbs?

1116
01:12:46,610 --> 01:12:47,443
- Yes.

1117
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:54,740
- Mr. Bobbs, we are from
Animal Protection Services

1118
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,110
I'm Sam Advow and she's...

1119
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:00,913
- Zia, Zia Fret animal control officer.

1120
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:03,960
- How can I help you guys?

1121
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,870
- Listen, we're here
because we got a report

1122
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:09,503
of potential abuse on a dog named Koko.

1123
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:13,713
- Abuse, what kind of abuse?

1124
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:17,710
Who would make such a claim?

1125
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:20,640
I take care of Koko with the
utmost respect she deserves.

1126
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,653
I would never harm or endanger her.

1127
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,313
This is insane.

1128
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:31,260
Mr. Bobbs, I have court orders
to get custody of your dog

1129
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:34,380
until it has been determined

1130
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:37,913
whether she has been
abused or not in any way.

1131
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:39,948
Here.

1132
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,200
- Oh God, you think I...

1133
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:55,223
- Well, you did try to marry her.

1134
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:01,023
Are you two doing anything?

1135
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:02,703
- You're sick.

1136
01:14:04,642 --> 01:14:08,040
- Mr. Bobbs, whether she
has been abused or not,

1137
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,653
it has to be determined.

1138
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,230
According to this court order,

1139
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:15,443
please surrender your dog to Ms. Zia.

1140
01:14:20,348 --> 01:14:21,483
- Where did she go?

1141
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:27,083
- Let me get her, she's probably scared.

1142
01:14:29,613 --> 01:14:32,830
Koko,

1143
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:34,063
Koko,

1144
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:46,398
Look, I don't know what this is about but,

1145
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:48,698
I think I have a good
idea of who's behind it.

1146
01:14:50,540 --> 01:14:52,820
So just go with these people

1147
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:54,520
and they'll take good care of you.

1148
01:14:56,289 --> 01:14:57,571
- Hey, come with me.

1149
01:14:57,571 --> 01:14:59,497
- You guys will take care of her, right?

1150
01:14:59,497 --> 01:15:02,664
- Yeah, we will take good care of her.

1151
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:31,370
- Hey, I know what happened to Koko.

1152
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:32,513
- I bet you do.

1153
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,140
How could you file a report against me?

1154
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:39,150
I know you're upset about
the courthouse fiasco

1155
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:43,823
but why don't you tell them
I would do something to Koko.

1156
01:15:43,823 --> 01:15:45,960
Don't you know how much I love her?

1157
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:48,390
- Randy, I'm not the
one that turned you in.

1158
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,150
We got a court order that says an official

1159
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,583
filed report of potential abuse, not me.

1160
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:55,913
- The court, so it's part of my lawsuit.

1161
01:15:58,865 --> 01:16:02,140
Oh my God, Tricia, I didn't wanna believe

1162
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:03,690
you would do something so cold.

1163
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:06,950
- I was really hurt at the courthouse.

1164
01:16:07,791 --> 01:16:10,460
I thought you were gonna propose.

1165
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:12,440
And I probably would have said no,

1166
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,940
because we haven't known
each other that long but,

1167
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:17,710
I thought about it.

1168
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:23,750
Randy you're sweet and caring
and a little naive at times.

1169
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:29,840
But this is something you
really want, I understand.

1170
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,673
I get it.

1171
01:16:33,682 --> 01:16:36,270
- They're not telling me anything, Trish.

1172
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:37,553
I don't even know where she is.

1173
01:16:37,553 --> 01:16:39,310
She could be hurting somewhere.

1174
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:42,110
- That's why I messaged
you, she's with us.

1175
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:43,630
- Oh, thank God.

1176
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:45,660
At your animal shelter?

1177
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:46,493
- Yeah.

1178
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:50,370
Between you and me, the
vet checks did not find

1179
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:51,690
any signs of abuse.

1180
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:53,790
We're just holding her until your hearing.

1181
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,370
- So Koko is okay?

1182
01:16:57,370 --> 01:17:00,500
- No, she's not eating, she's not active.

1183
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,340
She's really sad without you.

1184
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:04,853
But I'm doing my best to keep her company.

1185
01:17:07,584 --> 01:17:09,139
- Okay, good.

1186
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:14,613
It's Mike.

1187
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:17,273
Hi, hi Mike.

1188
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:19,940
Thank you for getting back to me.

1189
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:23,230
Yeah.

1190
01:17:23,230 --> 01:17:24,480
Yeah, they just took her.

1191
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:29,173
They had a court order, so
I had to let them, right?

1192
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:33,497
But thankfully, Trish
is looking after her.

1193
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:37,950
Mike, can you file a
motion to get Koko back?

1194
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:41,903
Something, I need to hang over
here, I'm literally dying.

1195
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:46,910
Okay, okay.

1196
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:47,743
All right, bye bye.

1197
01:17:47,743 --> 01:17:48,763
Mike, thank you.

1198
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:55,823
Patricia, I'm sorry.

1199
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,980
- Mike is gonna do something.

1200
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,480
They can't get away with this.

1201
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:04,633
- Thank you Tricia, you're a great friend.

1202
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:09,233
- Yeah, friends.

1203
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:21,360
- Okay Mr. Curtison, you did
a fine job telling a story,

1204
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:24,840
but I'd need some solid precedent,

1205
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,890
some other cases where this has happened

1206
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:30,363
to at least consider your case.

1207
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:34,010
- Your honor, I will present evidence,

1208
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:35,780
showing people all over the world,

1209
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:37,375
being allowed to marry animal.

1210
01:18:41,740 --> 01:18:45,770
- Okay everyone, if we can't
act like grownups about this,

1211
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:47,053
everyone's out of here.

1212
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:50,170
That's your first warning.

1213
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:53,020
Okay Mr. Curtison, it's on you.

1214
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,863
- So judge Howard, are you married?

1215
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:06,923
- That's your second time, three
strikes and everyone's out.

1216
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,023
Do you get it people?

1217
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,307
And you Mr. Curtison,

1218
01:19:14,347 --> 01:19:17,790
you can't ask me a question like that.

1219
01:19:17,790 --> 01:19:20,401
The tone in which you asked it,

1220
01:19:20,401 --> 01:19:24,840
didn't get lost on the
gallery, nor myself.

1221
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:27,840
Another little crowd-pleaser like that,

1222
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,210
I'll hold you for contempt.

1223
01:19:30,210 --> 01:19:32,350
- I beg your pardon for
the bit of grand standing,

1224
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:33,950
your honor.

1225
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:36,223
But I just wanted you to be open-minded.

1226
01:19:40,411 --> 01:19:43,743
- I'm not an unsympathetic
person, Mr. Curtison,

1227
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:49,360
I will listen and weigh
out all the evidence

1228
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,343
for your case that you bring before me.

1229
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:55,340
And for the record, I've been married

1230
01:19:55,340 --> 01:19:59,763
to the man of my dreams for over 36 years.

1231
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:02,233
You may continue.

1232
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:04,870
- Thank you, your honor.

1233
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:08,040
My point was only to illustrate that Koko

1234
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,240
bonded immediately with Mr. Bobbs

1235
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,640
the first time they were introduced.

1236
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:16,500
Just like all pure and natural love does.

1237
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,913
- Oh please, isn't that enough?

1238
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:24,783
- Mr. Stills, you are way out of line.

1239
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,160
- These two are clearly
just attention seekers

1240
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,820
for who knows what reason.

1241
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:32,670
They can't actually
expect you to entertain

1242
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:34,563
these senseless ideas.

1243
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:36,913
- Thank you.

1244
01:20:38,020 --> 01:20:40,920
Thank you for looking
out for me Mr, Stills,

1245
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:43,961
but I'm a big girl and I'll decide

1246
01:20:43,961 --> 01:20:47,943
what I can entertain and what I can't.

1247
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,263
Are we clear?

1248
01:20:51,106 --> 01:20:53,123
- Yes, your honor. Yes.

1249
01:20:56,370 --> 01:20:58,303
- You'll get your turn soon enough.

1250
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,820
You were saying Mr. Curtison?

1251
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:04,020
- Thank you, your honor.

1252
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:09,370
I was saying, none of
us can clearly define

1253
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:12,360
what it means to love or be in love.

1254
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,710
We feel something, a
physiological reaction

1255
01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:17,933
to another that we just can't explain.

1256
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:23,693
It's not perverse or a natural,

1257
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:27,233
on the contrary, it's totally organic.

1258
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:32,260
We will show you there
is no reason why Mr. Bobs

1259
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,260
shouldn't be granted a marriage license.

1260
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,310
And we will cite real instances.

1261
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:40,410
Thank you, your honor.

1262
01:21:43,134 --> 01:21:45,733
- You know, we'll see
about these other cases.

1263
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:48,780
Okay. All right.

1264
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:53,290
Now the question to the
County is, Mr. Stills is,

1265
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:57,940
should we go against our
established procedures?

1266
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:00,210
Like my grandpa used to say,

1267
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:03,253
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

1268
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:06,400
Okay Mr. Stills.

1269
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:07,340
- Thank you, your honor.

1270
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,373
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

1271
01:22:11,330 --> 01:22:14,760
This statute has been on
the books for over 100 years

1272
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:17,643
and it needs to remain in
effect without exception.

1273
01:22:18,930 --> 01:22:22,110
Think of the chaos this would cause

1274
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:24,750
when processing standpoint alone.

1275
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:27,540
Forms would have to be changed
from male, female and other,

1276
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:29,593
to species specific.

1277
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,620
And why stop at animals?

1278
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:34,550
This could lead the
request to marry everything

1279
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:37,753
from pickup trucks to robots.

1280
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:42,223
Today's circus simply can't be allowed.

1281
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,010
Thank you, your honor.

1282
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:47,270
- Ball is in your court.

1283
01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:50,063
You may present your evidence.

1284
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,400
- Your honor, I have
copies for your review.

1285
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,293
May I approach?

1286
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:05,800
- Well thank you for saving
me the research Mr. Curtison.

1287
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:08,620
I would also like to ask your kindness.

1288
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:12,610
I have a few witnesses, they
will testify to strengthen bond

1289
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:13,913
between Randy and Koko.

1290
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:20,300
- Okay, you have my permission
to present your witnesses,

1291
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:24,158
provided I don't have any
objection from the County.

1292
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:26,270
-  Fine, your honor.

1293
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:27,730
- Good.

1294
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:30,370
We're gonna take a 15 minute recess

1295
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:35,370
and officer Rice, make sure
that the animal control officer

1296
01:23:35,690 --> 01:23:36,669
and the psychiatrist are here.

1297
01:23:36,669 --> 01:23:40,491
-  Yes your
honor, I will bring them in.

1298
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:44,147
- Court is adjourned.

1299
01:23:50,368 --> 01:23:52,570
- Dr. Kingston, a man
by the name Randy Bobbs

1300
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:53,403
wants to marry his dog.

1301
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:56,430
Does that mean he is
suffering from schizophrenia?

1302
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:59,810
- Listen, as Mr. Bobbs
psychiatrist, I'm here to testify

1303
01:23:59,810 --> 01:24:01,057
not give any views.

1304
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:07,120
- Hi Randy, hi Mike.

1305
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,230
- Trish, did you bring Koko?

1306
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:11,520
- She's outside with animal control.

1307
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:12,980
- She's here, can I see her?

1308
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:16,410
- No, you still got a hearing to finish.

1309
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:17,640
- Court is now back in session.

1310
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:19,883
- I wish you guys all the best.

1311
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:31,643
- Officer rice, I want the
County witnesses first.

1312
01:24:42,224 --> 01:24:43,583
- Good morning, your honor.

1313
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:46,763
Mr. Bobbs is not crazy.

1314
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:52,773
He's a highly intelligent,
highly successful young man.

1315
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:58,283
He just wants to marry
who he wants to marry.

1316
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:03,093
- There was a complain
came from, county clerk.

1317
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:10,450
But all we found, a guy who
loves and cares his dog.

1318
01:25:12,314 --> 01:25:14,623
We don't see any abuse.

1319
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:19,440
So Animal Control is willing
to release Koko to Randy.

1320
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:20,990
I've seen my friend Randy,

1321
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:23,040
deal with a lot of heartache in his life,

1322
01:25:24,730 --> 01:25:25,823
but now he's happy.

1323
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,700
He's never been as happy
as he is with Koko.

1324
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:33,283
- It's not just about Randy,

1325
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:39,650
Koko needs him too, she's
not doing good without him.

1326
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:46,883
She barely eats.

1327
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:52,980
You know, I have never
seen such love between

1328
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,163
two individuals.

1329
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,683
- Since Randy has found Koko,

1330
01:26:00,524 --> 01:26:03,200
he has been more motivated than ever.

1331
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:07,393
Since Koko was taken away, Bobbs
has been miserable at work.

1332
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:12,140
He misses her terribly.

1333
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:13,333
- I raised Randy,

1334
01:26:14,260 --> 01:26:17,073
but he taught me a very
important lesson in life.

1335
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:22,060
I was injured during the Gulf War

1336
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:23,513
and I can't have sex anymore.

1337
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:26,560
I used to believe that,

1338
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,590
I couldn't have a relationship without sex

1339
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:33,313
but when I saw the love
between Randy and Koko,

1340
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:37,430
it gave me a realization
there's so much more

1341
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:39,253
to a relationship than sex.

1342
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:45,933
I started dating and I think
I found the right woman.

1343
01:26:47,781 --> 01:26:51,970
It would be very fitting
for Randy to be allowed

1344
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:53,733
to be with the woman he wants.

1345
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,753
Thank you, your honor.

1346
01:27:02,007 --> 01:27:04,303
-  Randy Bobbs to the stand.

1347
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:18,623
You may be seated.

1348
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:29,663
- This is your chance to
tell your side in your words.

1349
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,583
- First, thank you your honor,
for hearing my case today.

1350
01:27:37,570 --> 01:27:41,053
I'll do my best to explain why
I want to take this action.

1351
01:27:42,220 --> 01:27:45,920
- I must say Mr. Bobbs,
you have demonstrated

1352
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,533
amazing resiliency in your life.

1353
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,710
You have suffered great losses

1354
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:55,833
and it truly saddens me.

1355
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,583
- Thank you, your honor.

1356
01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:03,930
It was those losses that kept me in fear

1357
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:06,223
of of love and relationships.

1358
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,583
I've always found it hard
to open up with people.

1359
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,530
I tried with my first fiance

1360
01:28:16,530 --> 01:28:20,653
but she left me and I
was devastated again.

1361
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:27,840
But then I met Koko and
my whole life has changed.

1362
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,693
I'm a better person because of Koko.

1363
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:38,203
I've never felt this bond
with anyone else before.

1364
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:42,813
She's there for me, and I'm there for her.

1365
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,880
That's what it means to be in love.

1366
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:47,707
The more time we spend together,

1367
01:28:47,707 --> 01:28:51,090
the more whole I feel as a person.

1368
01:28:51,090 --> 01:28:55,830
I want to have a lawful
official way to pay tribute

1369
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,123
to the soul I feel most connected to.

1370
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:01,730
That's why I decided to marry Koko.

1371
01:29:04,580 --> 01:29:09,580
But when the County took
her away, I'm sorry.

1372
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,200
I apologize, your honor.

1373
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:20,200
I just want the world
to acknowledge how pure,

1374
01:29:20,540 --> 01:29:25,133
how right the bond between us is.

1375
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:29,700
So what if she's a different species?

1376
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:33,713
The bond we have, the love is real.

1377
01:29:34,930 --> 01:29:37,770
Marriage is the only way to to acknowledge

1378
01:29:37,770 --> 01:29:39,293
and celebrate that love.

1379
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,573
I'm not asking for much, am I your honor?

1380
01:29:45,690 --> 01:29:49,170
- You're asking for an
awful lot, Mr. Bobbs.

1381
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:51,970
It's gonna be tough for me to say yes,

1382
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:55,630
because even if your attorney has provided

1383
01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:59,770
and presented anecdotal evidence
of cases all over the world

1384
01:30:02,890 --> 01:30:06,020
I have to follow the law
of this jurisdiction.

1385
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:09,150
And I'm sorry, but I
don't believe that the law

1386
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:10,463
is going to allow that.

1387
01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:13,453
- Your honor, if I may interject.

1388
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:19,073
Yes Mr. Curtison, this is your witness.

1389
01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:22,660
- Your honor, we're all
here today because my client

1390
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:26,280
is forbidden by law to
marry his dog, correct?

1391
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:30,632
- You are interrupting
me to state the obvious?

1392
01:30:30,632 --> 01:30:33,973
I hope this is in some kind
of attempt to skirt the law.

1393
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,060
- Funny you should say that,

1394
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:41,573
we're not here to skirt
the law, nor is the County.

1395
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:44,690
If your honor will allow me,

1396
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:46,290
I like to read the law out loud.

1397
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:49,563
- Perhaps you better, Mr. Curtison.

1398
01:30:50,930 --> 01:30:53,060
- Your honor, the statute clearly states,

1399
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:55,700
the marriage is between two people.

1400
01:30:55,700 --> 01:31:00,700
- Technically Mr. Stills
is incorrect, and I quote,

1401
01:31:01,967 --> 01:31:05,180
"A marriage license shall be
issued to two consenting adults

1402
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:06,980
who can appear before the clerk."

1403
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:10,423
The law only requires
two consenting adults.

1404
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:16,560
- Okay fine, I'll grant that
Koko is an adult in dog years

1405
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:21,740
but she can't consent, she's a dog.

1406
01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:24,683
- Your honor, let's just ask Koko.

1407
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:27,190
- What?

1408
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:29,437
Here now, in my courtroom?

1409
01:31:30,369 --> 01:31:32,990
- Your honor, I have
proof of scientific study

1410
01:31:32,990 --> 01:31:35,700
showing that everything that
we say a dog can understand.

1411
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:36,823
May I approach?

1412
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:48,643
- Okay, Mr. Bobbs is done.

1413
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:53,513
I'll allow this but, Mr. Curtison,

1414
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:57,720
is this it for your case?

1415
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,270
What?

1416
01:31:59,270 --> 01:32:01,510
Really, is this it?

1417
01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:02,513
- Yes, your honor.

1418
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:08,213
- All right Mr. Bobbs, you're dismissed.

1419
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:41,733
- Your honor, this is Koko.

1420
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:45,890
- She's gorgeous.

1421
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:50,890
Officer Rice, please have
the witness take the stand.

1422
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:55,210
- Your honor, a dog in the witness stand?

1423
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:58,013
- We need to hear from Koko, Mr. Stills.

1424
01:33:03,810 --> 01:33:07,050
Let's see if that study is correct.

1425
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:12,050
Koko, do you want to get married to Randy?

1426
01:33:16,010 --> 01:33:18,103
- Your honor, you can't be serious.

1427
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:23,450
What, it is just tone of voice not words.

1428
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:27,113
Koko, do you wanna get buried?

1429
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:40,447
- Well, that's certainly a
different reaction, Mr. Stills.

1430
01:33:40,447 --> 01:33:42,573
I don't think she likes you.

1431
01:33:45,060 --> 01:33:47,540
- Well, I still can't
believe that this hound

1432
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:51,190
can really understand
what's going on here today.

1433
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:57,970
- No, I think Koko has proven her point.

1434
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,620
Thank you Koko, you are dismissed.

1435
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:03,023
And thank you officer.

1436
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:19,373
Well, I think we've all
learned something here today.

1437
01:34:20,240 --> 01:34:23,530
There are all forms of love in this world

1438
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:26,820
and no one person can define it,

1439
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:29,313
except to know when you're in it.

1440
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:34,420
And we've learned that
a statute on the books

1441
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:39,240
needs forever updating
since we are the judicial

1442
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:44,040
and not the legislative branch
of this fine local government

1443
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:48,550
we can't alter or bend the
rules specially when stated

1444
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:51,000
as clearly as they are.

1445
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,883
it's up to the lawmakers now,

1446
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,650
to put their finger in
this dyke before it leaks

1447
01:34:57,650 --> 01:35:01,893
any more on the floor of
someone else's courtroom.

1448
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:08,483
I may live to regret this,
but that's my ruling.

1449
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:15,260
This court orders that Mr.
Bobbs to obtain the license,

1450
01:35:17,550 --> 01:35:20,863
the marriage license that
he is seeking be allowed.

1451
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:25,017
Court is adjourned.

1452
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:34,360
- So there we have it,
the actual news exclusive.

1453
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:38,280
Judge Howard just ruled,
Randy Bobbs and his dog Koko

1454
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:39,323
can get married.

1455
01:35:40,777 --> 01:35:43,300
- Koko, Koko, girl

1456
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:48,537
- Congratulations you two.

1457
01:35:48,537 --> 01:35:49,663
She is all yours.

1458
01:35:52,672 --> 01:35:53,843
- Let's go, let's go.

1459
01:36:06,046 --> 01:36:07,644
- Good job, kid.

1460
01:36:07,644 --> 01:36:08,477
- Thank you.

1461
01:36:08,477 --> 01:36:09,310
