Our Land

2
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,480
<i>This is Telangana.</i>

3
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,960
<i>The feudal system of the Hyderabad
State has occupied half of Telangana.</i>

4
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,000
<i>The Nizam,
a puppet of British Imperialism...</i>

5
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,840
<i>...rules this land.</i>

6
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,280
<i>This is Siripuram, a village
in the district of Nalgonda.</i>

7
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,920
<i>Hundreds of landless peasants live here.</i>

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,640
<i>Ramayya is the son of one
such poor farmer.</i>

9
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,480
<i>This story begins with Ramayya...</i>

10
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,720
<i>and follows him,
taking new turns.</i>

11
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,560
Irayya, give me a beedi.

12
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,880
Dawdling like bridegrooms,
are you! Get going. Get up!

13
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Sailu, get some water for
The Master.

14
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,040
- Hey you, Iriga!
- Yes, sir.

15
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,360
Hmm, go!

16
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,800
Your son has grown.

17
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,720
Starting tomorrow, send him to
mind the Dora's cattle.

18
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,160
All right.

19
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,840
Father...

20
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,640
- Father...?
- What is it?

21
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,440
I won't go to mind cattle.

22
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,200
What'll you eat if you don't work?
Are you a Dora's son?

23
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,280
Look my son, you're the child
of a hired hand.

24
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,400
A hired hand's son will
only ever be a hired hand.

25
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,880
It's our fate.

26
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,280
You must go to work,
even if you're dying.

27
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,920

Hey, Rangadu!

00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,200
Where are you all off to?

51
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,600
Gopayya died.

52
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,880
- How?
- I don't know.

53
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,600
Wait, I'm coming!

54
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,840
Oh my God! Oh, God...

55
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,600
What have you done to me?

56
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,640
How did Gopayya die?

57
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,840
The cart got stuck and
he fell into a ditch.

58
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,440
The cart ran over him,
and he died.

59
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,760
A man our own age died
before our very eyes...

60
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,520
<i>Here is Jagannath Reddy,
Zamindar of all this land.</i>

61
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,320
<i>He is the overlord of
50,000 acres.</i>

62
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,480
<i>Earlier, all the Zamindars
of Telangana...</i>

63
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,240
<i>were only tax collectors.</i>

64
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,160
<i>The Nizam later granted
them titles and jagirs.</i>

65
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,800
<i>They have seized thousands
of acres since then.</i>

66
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,760
<i>And all the farmers who
tilled the land...</i>

67
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,280
<i>...were forcibly turned into tenants.</i>

68
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,600
<i>These Zamindars took law
and justice into their own hands.</i>

69
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,240
<i>They became the pillars of
Hyderabad's feudal system.</i>

70
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,760
<i>They determine the fate of
the thousands who live here.</i>

71
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Well, how are the
collections, Lakshman Rao?

72
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,360
Almost over. Only two or three
still have to pay up.

73
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,440
Why haven't they paid?

74
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,920
How will they pay if you sit
twiddling your thumbs!

75
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,720
But I've told them...

76
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,160
So, you told them, did you?

77
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,440
You must hound and harass
them into paying taxes!

78
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,080
He is here, Dora (chieftain)

79
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,560
You think bowing and
scraping will do?

80
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,480
Who'll pay the tax,
you bastard!

81
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,000
Will your wife's pimp pay?

82
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,200
How will I pay, Dora?
When I harvest the crop...

83
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,240
Don't give me excuses,
you dirty son of a whore!

84
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,960
Think you can cheat
the Nizam Government?

85
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,880
I beg you, Dora...

86
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,000
I'll sell what I can and
pay the tax.

87
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,400
I'll break every bone in
your body if you don't pay!

88
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,640
What is she waiting for?

89
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,320
Hey you! Why are you dumb-struck?

90
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,480
Speak up!

91
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,520
What can I say...?

92
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,080
He died, leaving me high and dry.

93
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,440
Help my child and me!
I'll serve you dead or alive.

94
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,880
Each one to his own fate.
We can't change it.

95
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,600
Look, let the girl serve
the Mem Sahib in the Gadi.

96
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,480
And you can get by on daily
wage somewhere.

97
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,320
I told you to bring me
those papers.

98
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,000
Are the pots good?

99
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,240
How many?

100
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,520
You've brought less!

101
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,280
No need for all that.

102
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,840
Hey Iriga! Come here.

103
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,640
Get going! Go on!

104
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,680
What are you standing for?
Get going!

105
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,880
Today is the fair!

106
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,920
You talk big, you little bastard!

107
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,840
A coolie whore-son wants
to enjoy the fair?

108
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,880
You dare to hit me?

109
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,760
Go! I won't follow.

110
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,120
Think new clothes make you a Dora,
you thieving bastard?

111
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,640
You dare attack him?

112
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,080
Come on, get going!

113
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Go!

114
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,840
Please, sir. He's only a
boy. Don't take him amiss.

115
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,160
What else can he do but
serve the Dora!

116
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,200
He has to live by the Dora's
grace. Please don't be angry!

117
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,320
Come on, you!

118
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,720
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, sir.

119
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,920
How many did you bring?

120
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,520
I brought 38, Dora.

121
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,960
Don't stare at him!
Look down!

122
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,680
Go on, quick now!

123
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,280
Why are you staring?
Get moving!

124
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,440
Admiring yourself like a
bridegroom, are you?

125
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,560
Get going, you whore-son!

126
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,360
<i>Oh village lad,
Oh able little cow-herd</i>

127
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,960
<i>How long ago was it
since you tasted milk?</i>

128
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,120
<i>Oh you fresh faced lad!</i>

129
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,080
I wanted to ask...
How long will you put off marriage?

130
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,840
I won't marry, Father.

131
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,200
No, son. A home needs a
woman even to light a lamp!

132
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,240
Say what you will.
I won't marry now.

133
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,440
Father...

134
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,920
At least drink this rice gruel.

135
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,560
Look, son...

136
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,640
Sit here by me.

137
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,360
I'm old...

138
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
I'm waiting for the graveyard.

139
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,480
Not this now!

140
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,320
Let me say it...

141
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,840
Why don't you sleep quietly,
as I said?

142
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,040
Why don't you listen to me?

143
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,000
Drink some gruel first.

144
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,400
In my grandfather's time,
we had some land.

145
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,720
Only two acres of it remained
in my father's day.

146
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,360
I couldn't even hold on to that!

147
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,040
Nor have I been able
to get you married.

148
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,960
Anyway, you know all this...

149
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,320
Not a morsel in our belly
until we work.

150
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,480
Our lives will pass on
serving the Doras.

151
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,480
Hey Rama!

152
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,320
You're supposed to be working,
but you keep looking elsewhere!

153
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,240
I know what's up!
Don't to try to fool me.

154
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,760
Hey Malli! Where are you
off to? Come here!

155
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,200
I'll feed my baby
and come back, sir.

156
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,000
How often do you go,
you thieving bitch?

157
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,480
I really must feed my baby.
Please, I'll be right back.

158
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,200
You're saying you really have milk?
Let me see!

159
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,840
Okay. Go, you bitch.

160
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,000
Come back before this spit
dries up!

161
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,920
Oh! It's Ramulu.

162
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:03,240
Hey, Ramulu!
How are you?

163
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,400
I'm doing fine.

164
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,800
What dowry did you get?

165
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,080
Ah, what can poor folk give?

166
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,920
They just gave the girl.
It's up to me to look after her.

167
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,920
It's a pretty girl you
married, Ramulu Bhaiyya.

168
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,040
Pretty, isn't she?

169
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,040
Well, Ramulu! That sure is one
pretty wife you have! Eh?

170
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,200
Wonderful! That's some fine stuff,
Pratap Reddy Sahib.

171
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,520
It's all by your grace, sir.

172
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,000
Mastan, get another glass
for the Sahib!

173
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,040
You know about this Sangam?

174
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,120
There's a lot of talk about
it nowadays, I hear.

175
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,560
Sangam! Here, in our area?

176
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,040
Who will dare do it here?

177
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,240
Talk of Sangam? We'll
beat up the bastards!

178
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,360
Tehsildar Sahib, who can
even talk of Sangam here?

179
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,160
- May I recite a verse?
- Please, do!

180
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,360
<i>You are a flower,
yet why do you bring me flowers?</i>

181
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,440
<i>You are a flower,
yet why do you bring me flowers?</i>

182
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,360
<i>Overcome with love, I said:
you are the flower.</i>

183
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,640
<i>Lovers don't die,
but are buried alive.</i>

184
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,040
<i>Dig up the grave,
you will find...</i>

185
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,880
<i>They are waiting for
their beloved yet!</i>

186
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,000
Mastan, is everything
ready?

187
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,480
Almost done, Dora.

188
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,720
Ranga!

189
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,920
Any new bird in the village?

190
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,720
- Why don't you speak up?
- Yes, there is a new girl.

191
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,800
- Then bring her!
- As you wish, Dora.

192
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,680
Bring her into the room.

193
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,840
Ramulu! Ramulu?

194
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,080
- Coming...

195
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,200
Dora asked me to fetch your wife.

196
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,400
Oh brother, I beg of you...
I'll be your slave!

197
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,640
I'll be reborn as your son after I die!
Just don't take her.

198
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,760
Come on, get going.
- Please...

199
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,640
Come on! I said get going!

200
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Leave me! Let me go!

201
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,680
Did you bring her?
- Yes, Dora.

202
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,320
Stop crying, Ramulu...

203
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,120
Crying won't help.

204
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,960
These things happen so often.

205
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,600
How will our lives go on if
we brood over these things?

206
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,160
Go...go and sleep now.

207
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,320
Ramulu's wife just stepped
into her in-laws and...

208
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,240
...the vulture swopped in!

209
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,880
And folks here don't bother!
- Why are you concerned?

210
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,960
This Nagayya has no sense!
He brags to the Sangam.

211
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,600
And now, not a word!

212
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,720
If it had happened to me...

213
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,640
Damn son of a donkey!

214
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
Chandri!

215
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,920
You won't ever leave me, will you?

216
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,200
Sometimes, I'm afraid.

217
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,360
How close we are now!

218
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,560
Hey, Rami Reddy! Come here!

219
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,520
How often must I tell you
to get off this field?

220
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,320
I must come all this way
to remind you, huh?

221
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,880
You've got a swollen head, it seems!

222
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,920
Why the sarcasm, sir?
You asked me to come here.

223
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:14,040
Where will I go now if you
send me away?

224
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,520
I don't know about all that.
Don't try to wheedle me!

225
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,280
I have court orders,
I'll have you know!

226
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,560
Will you vacate?
Or shall I throw you out?

227
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,720
You want us to starve and
die because you have papers!

228
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,880
You may behead us but
we won't budge!

229
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,120
You talk big, don't you?
Maqbool, beat up Malliga.

230
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,440
We harm no one.
Let us live.

231
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,400
What're you waiting for?
Throw him out!

232
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,080
You may bring the Devil,
but we won't budge.

233
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,200
I'll see that you pay for this!

234
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,080
Get lost!

235
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,640
Whatever you may say,
what we did wasn't right.

236
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,440
He'll take revenge!

237
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:41,280
So what then, we keep quiet?
- How will we withstand his fury?

238
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,360
He has strong backing!
- But we can't keep quiet!

239
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,480
What else can we do but bear it?

240
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,160
I don't like what Bapi Reddy did.

241
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,000
What happened is done.
Let's decide what to do next.

242
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,560
Who will keep quiet if
your land is taken?

243
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,400
Do they give charity when we starve?

244
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,680
You folks will not listen to me...

245
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,880
Wait! Listen to what
I have to say.

246
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,280
What's the point of arguing?

247
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,080
It's better to tell
the Sangam folk.

248
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,720
They're educated folk.
They'll go to court for us.

249
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,640
What do you say?

250
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,480
What else? Who will say
no to a good thing?

251
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,920
You're quiet, Hanuma.
You have said nothing.

252
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,600
What will I say?
Who will listen to me?

253
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,840
All must speak!
Tell us what you think.

254
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,520
What he says is good and right.

255
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,640
Let's tell the Sangam folk.
Let's do as they say.

256
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,400
What about you, Veerayya?

257
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,920
Let's do it. We won't
loose anything.

258
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,360
And you, Ranganna?

259
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,520
I think it's a good idea!

260
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,560
You're quiet,
Rami Reddy Uncle.

261
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,320
What's there for me to say?
Why should I stop you? Do it.

262
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,800
Whatever you do, do it soon.

263
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,800
The bastards have grown arrogant!

264
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,120
They dare attack him!

265
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,800
Mastan, what were you doing
when all this happened?

266
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,800
I told them we had court
orders but they would not listen.

267
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,720
You were all idle?

268
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,960
You were away. Nor was
the young Dora here.

269
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,680
So what could we do?

270
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,960
So, Mastan! You stand
twiddling your thumbs!

271
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,840
Don't let me hear of such
things ever again!

272
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,720
Go! And see to
the guys who did it.

273
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,760
Stop, stop!

274
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,640
All of you, hear me!

275
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,720
Look at those three.

276
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,720
That guy Bapi Reddy ran
away with his father.

277
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,360
Or his fate would have been the same.

278
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,640
Go on, beat them.

279
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,600
Thieving whore-sons!
Dirty rogues...

280
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,000
Come, Ramayya. Sit down.

281
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,240
Things all right with you?
- Yes.

282
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,920
What're you putting in,
by the way?

283
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:26,040
Betel leaves and cloves.
Gives gruel a good flavour.

284
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,960
Why not ghee instead of all this?

285
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,240
How can we afford real ghee nowadays?

286
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,320
I heard
something happened in the village.

287
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,920
Nothing new.

288
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,120
They paraded Rami Reddy's
sons on donkeys.

289
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,680
I expected something
like this to happen.

290
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,000
No sign of Chandri?

291
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,120
She's at the Gadi.
Pratap Reddy has come.

292
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,720
Wait. She'll be back.

293
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,280
Hey, Baginayak, come over...
- Coming.

294
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,440
When did you come?

295
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,800
Want some water?
I'll fetch it.

296
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,400
Where did you go?
- To the Dora's Gadi.

297
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,560
Why?
- Pratap Reddy sent word.

298
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,640
So, you go when he calls?
- Can you dare disobey the Dora?

299
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,360
What happened there?

300
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,960
Speak up!

301
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,280
What else?
What always happens.

302
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,240
But believe me...I didn't
let him touch my breasts.

303
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,440
So?

304
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,120
They'll have milk later...
I told him not to touch them.

305
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,440
May you rot in hell!

306
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,880
Ramayya...try to understand!

307
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,280
You seem new around here.

308
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,600
Will you fill up?
The water's over.

309
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,240
What caste are you?
- Telugu.

310
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,240
Where are you from, son?

311
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,720
Siripuram. I told you.

312
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,800
I forgot. Why did you come
to this far off Suryapet?

313
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,880
What else but for livelihood?
I couldn't live there.

314
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,640
Rama, someone's at the door.
Go see who it is.

315
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,400
You fool. Is the Seth in?

316
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,520
Yes, sir.

317
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,560
Sir, Amir Sahib has come.

318
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,400
How come you graced my poor
home so early in the day?

319
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,000
No special reason.

320
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,320
I felt like seeing you.
So here I am.

321
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,720
Rama, get some snacks for Amir Sahib.

322
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,360
I told you! Find all details
before buying that land.

323
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,760
Why are you bothered?
I'll talk to Amir Sahib.

324
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,120
Give him something and
everything will be fine.

325
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,040
I don't know. He seems very greedy.
Seems to be expecting a lot.

326
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,400
We're getting such good land
so cheap. And you grumble!

327
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,400
Don't worry. We'll contact
the police when taking claim.

328
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,600
One word from him
and it's all done.

329
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,520
Rama is a good boy.
He is good at house work.

330
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,040
Don't send him on errands.
Let him be at home.

331
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,760
All right. How can
I say no to you?

332
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,360
Give me another pan.

333
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,960
No, brother no!
- Go on, smoke.

334
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,480
Please brother, no.

335
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:16,000
I must go. My Seth is
going to town.

336
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,320
Madam, you called me?

337
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,800
Ramayya, let down
the mosquito net.

338
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:58,320
Did you eat?
- No. I'll eat now, Madam.

339
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,120
I left you some sweets.
Eat it.

340
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,920
All right.

341
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,360
By the way, are you married?
- No, Madam.

342
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,400
Any kept woman back home?
- No, Madam.

343
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,760
Well, wait...

344
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,640
Come, sit here.

345
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:25,680
Here, some closer...

346
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,600
Madam, what's this?

347
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,720
Don't tell anyone.
It's all right, come here.

348
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,600
What a chance! And you
lost it!

349
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,760
You let go a willing bird!

350
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,280
You're a useless guy!
Drink.

351
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,720
No.
- Have a drink, you fool.

352
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,600
Give me some money.

353
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,960
Why did you leave her?
- My god, she's the Seth's wife!

354
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,520
So what? She is a woman, too.

355
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
She'd have given you money
if only you'd obeyed her.

356
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,600
You ruined it all.

357
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,840
Just look at me!

358
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,880
Three burglaries!
I went to jail ten times!

359
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,560
I was working for a Seth, too.

360
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,800
He had a daughter.

361
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,720
She was 14, a real juicy girl.

362
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,640
One day, with her...

363
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,920
You thieving whore-son!
Up to your dirty tricks, are you?

364
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,960
Brought a beggar home and
what does he do? Steal!

365
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,480
Where have you hidden it?
Tell me!

366
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,320
I didn't steal. I don't know!

367
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,600
Then who stole it?
Did it walk away?

368
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:38,840
Look at that ugly
thieving mug!

369
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,640
I know who you are going
round with!

370
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:46,480
Answer me straight. Or I'll
have the police beat you up!

371
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,400
Madam, I found the plate...

372
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:53,960
...in the puja room.

373
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:55,480
Were you blind all this time?

374
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:59,160
My god, you think this
dirty son of a bitch is any better?

375
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,680
Sir...

376
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:06,920
What's the matter?

377
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I won't stay here anymore.
I'll go.

378
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,160
Why? Is your belly
getting too full?

379
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,480
I beg you, Sir.
I won't stay here.

380
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,320
Give me my wage.

381
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,400
It's a topsy-turvy world,
my friend.

382
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,200
I told you then but you
didn't listen.

383
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,280
You did nothing, gained
nothing. Only got a bad name.

384
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,440
I don't want to live in
Suryapet anymore.

385
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,600
Where will you go?
Back home?

386
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:03,200
My village!
What's left there for me?

387
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,280
Go there and you'll be
Dora's bounded labourer.

388
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,400
Wonder how my father is.

389
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,360
Chandri...I thought
she was mine.

390
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,920
The Dora called her...
and she went to him.

391
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,400
Why should I live there?

392
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,960
I have nothing there...

393
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:31,040
Absolutely nothing...

394
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,720
Where will you go then?

395
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,600
Anywhere...
What's it to you?

396
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:45,840
Come with me...
I'll show you what fun is.

397
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,040
Where's Lachi?
- How should I know?

398
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,320
Where's Lachi?
- Ask over there!

399
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,640
He has come for Lachi, I hear...

400
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,280
From where?
- Seems like a smart guy!

401
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,840
Lachi? Lachi!

402
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,840
You have to wait a little.

403
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,880
Take care of him...

404
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,480
What are you staring for?

405
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:25,480
Come, sit close to me.

406
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,480
Can I touch you?

407
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:47,760
Your friend has paid me.
So do what you want! Come...

408
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,200
Ugh! Drunken bastard!

409
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,280
Hey, stop!

410
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,760
Not that way! This way.

411
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,120
No, not that way...this way.

412
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:30,200
What is this? You're making
me go around the world.

413
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,800
Haven't I paid you?

414
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,960
Go on, go!

415
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,200
Where have we come to?

416
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:58,880
To the same place you got in!

417
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,840
There's the liquor shop!

418
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,320
Good, I'll get off.

419
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,120
Some fare you are...

420
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,720
Take it.

421
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,440
Let's go to the cinema.

422
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,320
We'll go straight to
the theatre.

423
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:21,880
Stop...I'll get down and walk.

424
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,640
No, sir. I'll take you.

425
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,440
No matter. You stop.

426
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:34,920
Let's go.

427
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,320
How long have you had
this cough?

428
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,560
About a month.

429
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,560
Haven't you seen a doctor?

430
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:58,600
What's your name?
- Ramayya

431
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,040
Where do you stay?

432
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,800
You know the chabutra over
there? Next to that...

433
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,680
By the way, Ramayya...
Have you joined the Union?

434
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,600
What Union?
- The Rikshaw Union

435
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:19,080
Why do I need Unions and stuff?
- Why?

436
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,280
We're just day labourers.
Why do we need it?

437
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,120
It's very wrong to think
this way.

438
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:29,080
Why are there Unions?
to help and look after you!

439
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:32,400
It'll help if you're in
trouble tomorrow.

440
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,480
A Union will safeguard your rights.

441
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,720
Get in, sir.

442
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,560
Breathe in.
Take a deep breath.

443
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:04,760
What's wrong with my friend?

444
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,000
Hakim Sahib says your pain will
increase if you operate a rickshaw.

445
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,760
No rickshaw pulling, he says.
- How will I live, then?

446
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,400
Stop for a few days, bhai.
You'll get better.

447
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:05,120
Radayya, Maqbool Sahib
will speak. You must come.

448
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,000
Ramayya...

449
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:16,280
Come to the gate-meeting
this afternoon. Don't miss it.

450
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,560
What good am I there?

451
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,840
Don't say that. Come and hear
what he has to say.

452
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:28,960
They're depriving us of all
our rights. Sucking us dry!

453
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:34,360
When we ask for a raise, they
say yes but never raise wages.

454
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,800
The wage they provide doesn't
even meet our basic needs.

455
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:41,120
We must be united if our lot
is to be improved!

456
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,040
Nothing is impossible
to achieve if we are united!

457
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,240
Long Live Revolution!
Long Live the Workers' Union!

458
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:55,000
Workers of the world, unite!

459
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:09,800
I feel we must talk to the
owners before the strike.

460
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,480
Carry on with that,
I told you.

461
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:21,360
Peaceful means may not work...
- Let us come to a decision.

462
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,560
Don't you recognize me, sir?

463
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:35,680
You look familiar.

464
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,560
You got into my rickshaw,
and then walked when I started to cough.

465
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,800
It was I, sir.

466
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:45,600
Are you OK now?
- Yes.

467
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,040
When did you join here?
- A month ago.

468
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,920
Have you joined the Union?

469
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:53,520
No, but I'll join right away.

470
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,600
You must. The Union is
for you all.

471
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:02,360
Yes, kill me and my kids!
Then you'll be happy!

472
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:07,160
When my kids and I die,
you can get happily drunk!

473
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:10,280
No one can stop you then,
go on! Kill us!

474
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,080
You're getting too big
for your own good!

475
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,320
Naturally! With you feeding
me so well!

476
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,360
You keep talking and I'll kick you!

477
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:20,390
One more word and I'll kill you!

478
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,840
I earn the money,
and it's mine to spend.

479
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,840
Who are you tell me how to spend it?

480
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,950
You talk like your father's
the one feeding you.

481
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,520
You didn't say it was
your father's money.

482
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,800
You've no shame while
raising kids!

483
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,920
You whore! I'll break your
bones if you say anything!

484
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,720
Yes, kill and eat me!
You hungry bastard.

485
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:39,760
I'll teach you!

486
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,080
You feel nice when you
fight this way?

487
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,360
Did I say anything to her?

488
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,000
You make my name mud!

489
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,200
Look at him! If he drinks
away his wages...

490
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:56,440
What will my kids
and I live on?

491
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:03,120
Who cares about me? All anyone
cares about are themselves.

492
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:07,640
My body, my heart is on fire
when I work near the boiler.

493
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,080
Do you care?
Sure, you do.

494
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,360
She only knows how to nag.

495
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,280
The factory owners make
a lot of profit.

496
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,880
Let's see how they do it.

497
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:52,280
Let's take our factory
as an example.

498
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,160
To manufacture goods,
the factory needs...

499
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:58,240
...machines, fuel, raw material
and labour.

500
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:03,760
Machines, fuel and
raw material depreciate.

501
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,440
Let's take the above cost
to be Rs.3000.

502
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,600
Now, another value is
added to the cost.

503
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:13,240
That's labour.
It's value is Rs.1000.

504
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,440
So, the total cost is Rs.4000.

505
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,760
As far as raw material, fuel
and machines are concerned...

506
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,960
...the owner pays the correct price.

507
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:28,800
Do they pay labour its
right value? No!

508
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,800
They give workers
only 500 rupees.

509
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,120
What's the total?

510
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:38,360
Depreciation, fuel plus
raw stock is Rs.3000.

511
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,440
Add 500 for the labour.

512
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,080
It all adds up to 3500,
right?

513
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:46,000
Where has the other 500 gone?

514
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,520
That's called surplus value.

515
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,200
The surplus value goes right
into the owner's pocket.

516
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,080
If a worker works half a day
for his own livelihood...

517
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,840
...he works the rest of the
day for the owner's profit.

518
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,400
Yes, this is exploitation
from within.

519
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,680
How do we stop it?

520
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:14,920
Good question. The state of
the villages is atrocious.

521
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,760
You've seen the cities, too.
It must change radically.

522
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,960
How can that happen?
- Why not?

523
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,440
For instance, take the
People of Russia.

524
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,720
They fought and liberated
themselves from landlords...

525
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,000
...and capitalists.

526
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,280
Similarly, other people are
fighting this exploitation.

527
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,240
I'll go, sir.

528
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:42,040
Come in.
Have some tea before you go.

529
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,240
Want some water?
- No, sir.

530
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,080
Sit down, Ramayya.

531
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,560
Surayya, let's have some tea.

532
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,120
What's this?
- I must send it to my father.

533
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,920
Oh, to your village.
- Yes, sir.

534
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,640
Your father's name?
- Irayya.

535
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:22,040
Name of the village?
- Siripuram, Nalgonda Zilla.

536
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,120
What shall I write to
your father?

537
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,960
Well, that I'm okay here.

538
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:56,080
Why don't you learn to read?
- Me?

539
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,640
Yes, I mean you Ramayya.

540
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:13,320
Look, the world of tomorrow
is yours. Of workers.

541
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:17,280
What you're learning now
is through experience.

542
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,520
If you're educated...

543
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:22,560
You'll learn about society
and the world.

544
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,280
Your skill will improve,
and shine.

545
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,720
Concede our just demands!
- What can I do?

546
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,800
We'll stop working if our
demands aren't met!

547
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,160
Come what may, we must win
our rights.

548
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,520
Give me a beedi.

549
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:03,840
Ramayya...

550
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,840
Let's go and talk.

551
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:15,960
How are you in here?

552
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:19,200
What happened to you?

553
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:21,800
Oh, that.
It's a long story.

554
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:26,440
Forget my affair.
Why are you here?

555
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,960
We had a strike at our factory
and I was arrested.

556
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,120
I want some water.

557
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,800
Mallayya, get some water.

558
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:41,880
How's my father?
- He's fine.

559
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,920
We didn't know where you were
until you sent money.

560
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,680
Your father misses you.

561
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:02,440
Is Chandri there?

562
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,560
She married and went away.

563
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,520
I couldn't think properly then.

564
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
I came apart because
I was angry at Chandri.

565
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:14,760
Now I know how wrong I was.

566
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,360
What's the point
of repenting now?

567
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,640
I heard there was a big
struggle in our village.

568
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,240
Tell me about it.

569
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:46,960
Our village is really not
the same anymore.

570
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,080
The entire village is as one.

571
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:53,320
It's joined the Sangam
and stands united.

572
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,840
Those who had terrorized us
can't sleep now!

573
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,520
For fear of the Sangam.

574
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,120
Really? Are you telling me
the truth?

575
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,600
Would I ever lie to you?

576
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:07,880
All are one, whether dobi,
barber, potter, or cobbler.

577
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:11,360
No bonded labour or tax!
Do what you will, we said.

578
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:18,560
We were all one.
The Doras were raging with fury.

579
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,480
They got us beaten by goondas.

580
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,360
Did we take it lying down?
We gave it back to them!

581
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,360
One day...

582
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:32,440
We must all stand united
and face any hardship.

583
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,400
But we'll not tolerate
their tyranny.

584
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,920
We must all be together.

585
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,840
Sathi Reddy is like a father
to us all.

586
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,000
The Police Patel came
at that moment.

587
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:47,360
A meeting, is it?

588
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,640
Sathi Reddy, come here!

589
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:52,880
What's the matter?

590
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,160
Come, I must talk to you.

591
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:11,360
How often must I tell you to
stop this Sangam nonsense?

592
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:13,680
Came all this way to tell me this?

593
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:18,600
Dora asked me to tell you
to come back to work.

594
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,920
Tell your Dora we won't
dance to his tune now.

595
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:25,520
Come! All of you!

596
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,560
As he ran, Mastan turned
and fired.

597
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:31,160
Our Rangadu died.

598
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:38,800
Almost a hundred were
badly injured.

599
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,520
They called the police and
got four of us arrested.

600
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:00,440
And then, they took us away.
Beat us up like hell.

601
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:04,280
They branded me
with an iron rod.

602
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,680
While branding me,
they said:

603
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:10,440
"We're laying the road to
Moscow on your head."

604
01:27:10,840 --> 01:27:12,480
You're going the right way,
they said.

605
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,680
What's this Moscow?

606
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,680
Moscow is a city in Russia.

607
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,480
The poor there fought and won.

608
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:28,080
I'm just an ignorant
shepherd.

609
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,000
I don't have an inch of land.

610
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,520
But when I see him,
I just fell this.

611
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:35,840
Every man must have
some land.

612
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,160
We're all attached to this
land till we die.

613
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,120
What's that ruckus?
Shut up!

614
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,680
Nagayya, I'm thinking of
going to our village.

615
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,440
Yes, you must.
Go and met the Sangam folk.

616
01:27:58,040 --> 01:27:59,600
When will you come?

617
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,040
I don't know

618
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:05,680
But tell them all:
I will be back.

619
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:24,240
What're they saying, Sir?
- Lies. All lies.

620
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,630
They say the Sangam members
are all goondas.

621
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:43,680
That they loot and
burn villages.

622
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,360
They are spouting lies
by the mouthful.

623
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:49,440
Sir, I want to know:
do you think people believe this?

624
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:52,320
Yes. There are a few
who believe it.

625
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,800
Anyway, you decided
as I had hoped you would.

626
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:01,320
I'm very happy you are
returning home this way.

627
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:30,720
You'll have to go home
via Alipuram.

628
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:36,840
You remember Yella Reddy,
don't you?

629
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:42,680
Yes, didn't he come to our
meeting in Murshidabad?

630
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:47,000
That's right. You remember well.
Give him this letter.

631
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,400
His house is by the fort.

632
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:53,480
Remember all that I told
you and keep it in view.

633
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:57,640
Understand the conditions
of the village well.

634
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:01,640
We'll surely win.
The final victory is ours.

635
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:04,040
Red Salute!

636
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,040
Halt!

637
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:24,160
Come up this way.

638
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,360
I've come from Hyderabad.

639
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:49,040
I have a letter for Yella Reddy
from Maqbool Sahib.

640
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:59,960
But when I went there...

641
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,520
Yes, I know son.
I'm Yella Reddy's mother.

642
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,560
But...how did it all happen?

643
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:11,640
Last night, Razakars and the
police attacked the village.

644
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:15,440
We didn't know what to do
and ran helter skelter.

645
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,600
Whoever they caught,
they killed.

646
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:22,320
They molested the women.

647
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,960
Others they tossed
into the garbage.

648
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:29,480
They may come again at any time.

649
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,640
Can you spare some water?

650
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:13,360
Did you see Yella Reddy?

651
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,240
Were his eyes open?

652
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:28,800
We had beaten back two
earlier raids.

653
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,600
But couldn't withstand
yesterday's attack.

654
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,880
We don't know what to do now.

655
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,760
We must get more guns...
Form more groups.

656
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,680
Distribute Zamindars' lands
amongst the people.

657
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:43,360
Our people in the cities
suffer the same.

658
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:47,720
That's what Maqbool Sahib
wrote to Yella Reddy, too.

659
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,120
We'll not stop the fight now.

660
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,960
<i>In Telangana,
by the end of 1946...</i>

661
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:55,040
<i>the Nizam government
carried out mass arrests.</i>

662
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:58,560
<i>And let loose police terrorism.</i>

663
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,920
<i>Under the pretext of
"Law & Order,"...</i>

664
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,600
.<i>..Razakars raided villages.</i>

665
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:08,800
<i>Their means of terror were
burning, looting, killing...</i>

666
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:11,880
<i>...raping women, and extortion.</i>

667
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:31,440
<i>Telangana oppressors redefined terror
and blood baths in history.</i>

668
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:50,720
<i>The raids continued
day and night.</i>

669
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:53,200
<i>People were victims of torture.</i>

670
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,960
<i>Some who were captured were
tortured into betraying the Sangam.</i>

671
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:01,440
<i>People were imprisoned,
spies were let loose.</i>

672
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:12,160
<i>Dark clouds of fear and
terror enveloped Telangana.</i>

673
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,960
Father...

674
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,360
How are you?

675
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:15,600
I'm here, Father. All our
troubles are over now.

676
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:30,800
Where's the gun?
Hand it over.

677
01:40:45,200 --> 01:40:47,240
<i>Telangana is awake.</i>

678
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:49,560
<i>Resistance started
everywhere.</i>

679
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:53,040
<i>Andhra Mahasabha and</i>
<i>the Communist Party...</i>

680
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:56,120
<i>...formed groups to resist</i>
<i>the terror.</i>

681
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,960
<i>The people of Telangana
took up arms to liberate...</i>

682
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:03,040
<i>...themselves from an evil
feudal rule.</i>

683
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:06,280
<i>Guerilla groups were formed
in villages.</i>

684
01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:10,360
<i>People began to collect arms
and make country guns.</i>

685
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:14,240
<i>The armed resistance of</i>
<i>the people...</i>

686
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,680
<i>...shook the foundations
of feudalism.</i>

687
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Will you eat?
- No.

688
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,600
Why don't you eat a little?

689
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,560
I'm not hungry now.

690
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:29,920
You're here and back in
the jungle within an hour.

691
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,920
You don't tell me where
you are or what you do.

692
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,360
You know everything, Father.

693
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,280
The villages are up in arms.

694
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:42,000
All the Doras have fled
to the city.

695
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:45,000
Our Dora has gone
to the city.

696
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:49,040
He may be gone, but his son
Pratap Reddy is here.

697
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:53,800
The whole village is united.
Let's see how long he stays.

698
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:01,960
I don't know. I'm afraid
for you sometimes.

699
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:04,520
You are my only son.

700
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:08,840
It's not as if I had four
and could afford to lose one.

701
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,200
What better life is there
than working for the people?

702
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:16,040
You know what our life has
been like here!

703
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,760
Time is on our side now.

704
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:21,440
All of Telangana is aflame!

705
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:23,440
Don't ask me to give up
my work.

706
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:26,920
What you're doing is good.
I didn't say it wasn't.

707
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:31,920
But you roam all over. I'm
afraid of what may happen.

708
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:35,200
Why fear? What's meant to happen,
will happen.

709
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:45,520
Dora, the Sangam folk are
making bombs and guns.

710
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:47,440
We can't fight them during the day.

711
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,040
What do you mean?
- What I say is true.

712
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:53,120
They are very strong.
- So, then we are weak like women?

713
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:56,320
You cowardly bastard!

714
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:09,240
Sir, we don't have to be afraid.

715
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:11,600
Who is afraid?

716
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:22,520
I beg your pardon, sir.
It's better to heed Durgayya.

717
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:27,440
Yes, Dora. You have fed us
and we're afraid for you.

718
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,280
All the Doras have gone away.

719
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:32,360
It'd be better if you too
went to the city, Dora.

720
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:38,800
We will come with you, too.

721
01:45:39,080 --> 01:45:42,080
Who are you to tell me?
What's life without guts?

722
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:48,320
I'll send for more police
and Razakars.

723
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:56,280
Let's see who dares come here!

724
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,840
I had my say.
It is as you wish.

725
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:02,440
There is no wishing. I'll not
leave the Gadi, never.

726
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,560
Well, Mastan?

727
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,040
If the Master permits...

728
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:45,880
You head over there.
I'll approach from here.

729
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,800
You know what to do.

730
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:51,240
Throw the bomb from
that corner.

731
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:56,120
We must get down after
they go to that side.

732
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:03,200
All the others will rush in
when the bomb goes off.

733
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:56,160
Mallayya, bring the papers.
Throw them into the fire.

734
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,400
Wait!

735
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:10,040
These papers held us in
bondage all these years.

736
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:12,520
The Doras could play their
ruthless game.

737
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,440
They sucked us dry.

738
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:17,680
Their game is up.
Our hardships are over.

739
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:20,840
Go, set fire to that heap.

740
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:47,720
Victory to the Sangam!

741
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:57,800
We still have the problem of
land in spite of all this.

742
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,840
All this land was ours once.

743
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:03,920
Then the Doras exploited it.
Now, we have our land back.

744
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:08,080
Uncle Sathi Reddy will preside
over the land distribution.

745
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:11,360
Why me? there are other
elders in the village.

746
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:15,360
It's not a matter of big or
small, but for the benefit of all.

747
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:18,160
Yes, what we want
is distribution.

748
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,080
<i>In the Telangana struggle...</i>

749
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:24,320
<i>...30 lakhs of people in 3000</i>
<i>villages were liberated.</i>

750
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:26,720
<i>They established
a people's rule.</i>

751
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,720
<i>People's committees brought
about massive land reforms.</i>

752
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,800
<i>Nearly 10 lakh acres
were redistributed.</i>

753
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:38,000
<i>Bonded labour was abolished,
along with exploitation.</i>

754
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:41,680
Look, my Ramayya is
giving land to everyone!

755
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:46,000
Whenever I ask, all he says
is wait. And wait!

756
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:48,840
Others matter to him
more than I do!

757
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,480
What is this, Irayya?
You're being childish.

758
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:55,280
We are giving to everyone,
one by one.

759
01:51:55,400 --> 01:51:59,040
You're so impatient! You want
to harvest before sowing!

760
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:02,320
That's not it...
- Don't drone on in my ear.

761
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:06,680
You called me. I suppose
everyone's got land now?

762
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:09,920
Well, what of these people?

763
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:13,640
Let's see. How about land
beyond the village for them?

764
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:15,520
Listen, all of you.

765
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:18,600
You will all get land,
as Ramayya has said.

766
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:20,560
Don't worry.

767
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:23,680
All of you will get
land sooner or later.

768
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:29,200
And Ramayya, we must also
distribute...

769
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:32,280
...the cattle and ploughs
we found in the Gadi.

770
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:35,480
Yes, Uncle. I hadn't
forgotten that.

771
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:39,800
Ramayya, why don't you give
me some land now, at least?

772
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:41,880
I'm tired of asking.

773
01:52:41,960 --> 01:52:45,280
Wait, Father. You are
driving me crazy.

774
01:52:45,680 --> 01:52:48,240
See how he brushes me off!

775
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:51,480
Listen, Irayya.

776
01:52:51,560 --> 01:52:54,440
You take the two acres next
to the Dhobi ghat.

777
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:58,680
I'll tell Hanuma. You go and
tend your land.

778
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:00,640
May you live to be one hundred!

779
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,360
God bless you! Your words
are sweet music.

780
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:10,560
I'll go see my land.

781
01:53:23,480 --> 01:53:28,120
I wonder how my folks are.
There's been no word from them.

782
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:30,120
I keep thinking about them.

783
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:34,960
My brother hasn't come by
even once.

784
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:44,400
Don't you worry.
They'll all be well.

785
01:53:45,600 --> 01:53:48,080
I met a farmer from there
the other day.

786
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:50,760
All the Doras have gone
to the city.

787
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,160
That so?
- Yes.

788
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:01,840
You know, over there they're
fighting hard and well.

789
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:06,240
We're teaching our members
rifle shooting there.

790
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:08,040
Why don't you learn?

791
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:16,880
Why don't I learn, if only
some would teach me!

792
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:24,280
One...Two...Three...

793
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:39,760
<i>August 15th, 1947</i>

794
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,520
<i>India gains Independence.</i>

795
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:45,760
<i>Power was transferred from
the British Viceroy...</i>

796
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:50,120
<i>...to the Indian National
Congress led by Pandit Nehru.</i>

797
01:55:02,520 --> 01:55:05,000
<i>The entire country
celebrated Independence Day.</i>

798
01:55:05,080 --> 01:55:07,680
<i>People danced with joy.</i>

799
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:11,520
<i>But conditions in the State
of Hyderabad were different.</i>

800
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,960
<i>The Nizam refused to join
the Indian Union.</i>

801
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:18,600
<i>He declared that Hyderabad
would be free.</i>

802
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,920
<i>Demanding that Hyderabad
accede to the Indian Union...</i>

803
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,920
<i>The Indian National Congress,
the Communist Party...</i>

804
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,880
<i>...and other National Parties
held demonstrations.</i>

805
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:34,120
<i>The disturbed situation
and public pressure...</i>

806
01:55:34,200 --> 01:55:38,040
<i>...forced the Nizam Government
to free political prisoners.</i>

807
01:55:54,520 --> 01:55:56,800
The white man's rule is over.

808
01:55:57,080 --> 01:55:59,520
It's our own rule now.
We're free.

809
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:02,880
They've released prisoners from
jail. We were freed, too.

810
01:56:03,280 --> 01:56:05,160
Sattayya here has been released.

811
01:56:05,240 --> 01:56:07,040
Yes, I too am coming
from prison.

812
01:56:07,600 --> 01:56:09,720
Why not come to our village?
- Shall I?

813
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:11,560
Sing for us.

814
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:44,000
<i>Cart yoked to cart, we will
build a caravan of 16 carts.</i>

815
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:48,000
<i>And which cart will get you,
Oh Nizam of ruthless rule?</i>

816
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:51,760
<i>You've worsted the Nazis,
Oh Nizam of ruthless rule.</i>

817
01:57:11,640 --> 01:57:19,240
<i>The police and the army,
you think they are mighty.</i>

818
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:26,880
<i>You turned them loose,
to loot our villages.</i>

819
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:29,960
<i>Oh Nizam of ruthless rule</i>

820
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:54,000
<i>All the landlords and
all the feudal lords, too</i>

821
01:57:54,080 --> 01:58:01,840
<i>They cower and seek your
shelter, oh brave protector.</i>

822
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:28,800
<i>Men and women both,
and all the children, too...</i>

823
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:36,080
<i>We collected cart loads of
stones and pelted your army.</i>

824
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:43,520
<i>And into their eyes,
we threw chilli water</i>

825
01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:51,000
<i>Your mighty army turned tail
and ran, oh ruthless Nizam</i>

826
01:59:10,360 --> 01:59:17,680
<i>Sprawling Suryapeta is ours
as is Nalgonda in the Center</i>

827
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:25,160
<i>You're in far off Hyderabad
and Golconda towers above</i>

828
01:59:25,240 --> 01:59:29,240
<i>Under the ramparts
of Golconda fort...</i>

829
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:40,000
<i>We build you a grave!
O Nizam of ruthless rule</i>

830
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:43,600
<i>The Nizam's official called
the landlords and...</i>

831
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:46,600
<i>...title holders who had left
the villages...</i>

832
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:49,240
<i>...to an emergency meeting.</i>

833
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:51,360
<i>Speaking to them, he said:</i>

834
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:53,800
<i>"We are all in an extremely
difficult situation."</i>

835
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:56,600
<i>"On the one hand, there is
the Indian Union..."</i>

836
02:00:56,680 --> 02:01:00,160
<i>"...and anti-social forces
on the other. You know it all."</i>

837
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:04,600
<i>"You must all go back and
protect peace and order."</i>

838
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:08,080
<i>"Foreign powers have
promised us weapons."</i>

839
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:11,440
<i>"Similarly, the Government will
also provide full support."</i>

840
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:15,120
Generation after generation...

841
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:18,160
...under the kindness of our
gracious Nizam Sarkar...

842
02:01:18,240 --> 02:01:21,240
...we have been the owners of our lands.

843
02:01:22,120 --> 02:01:26,240
Our beloved and noble state
is threatened by danger now.

844
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:30,440
We'll not resist any
sacrifice asked of us.

845
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:34,080
Yes. This is what I expected
of all of you.

846
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:37,640
Return to your lands and
help us quell this rebellion.

847
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:56,480
<i>Hark, oh victorious son of
India, victory is ours!</i>

848
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:04,400
<i>In the North is a hamlet.
Rampuram is its name, oh son</i>

849
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:13,880
<i>In that hamlet are
only hovels and huts</i>

850
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:23,200
<i>It's the home of workers
who labour day and night</i>

851
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:17,760
<i>The sweat of share-croppers
water the crops, oh son</i>

852
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:25,720
<i>Whatever the crop,
unjust levies are their lot.</i>

853
02:03:25,800 --> 02:03:34,440
<i>Thanedar and Tehsildar,
all must be given their cut.</i>

854
02:03:36,160 --> 02:03:39,600
Get up! Run! The police
and Razakars are coming!

855
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:45,080
From where?
Which side?

856
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:52,080
We must stop the police and
Razakars! You, go over there!

857
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:29,520
<i>September 13th, 1948</i>

858
02:10:30,240 --> 02:10:33,720
<i>The Union Government took Police
Action against Hyderabad</i>

859
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:39,600
<i>Within five days,
on September 19th, 1948...</i>

860
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:43,000
<i>The Nizam surrendered
to the Indian Government.</i>

861
02:10:44,040 --> 02:10:47,800
<i>The Indian Army entered
Hyderabad and Secunderabad</i>

862
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:52,080
<i>It was commanded by
General J.N. Chowdhry</i>

863
02:10:52,240 --> 02:10:54,320
<i>The people hailed the army.</i>

864
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:58,040
<i>The State of Hyderabad
was declared...</i>

865
02:10:58,120 --> 02:11:00,440
<i>...part of the Union of India.</i>

866
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:03,520
You were saying something.
Tell us more.

867
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:06,120
The Congress held a meeting
in Pirlapelli.

868
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:09,560
All went well. I'll tell you
what happened there.

869
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:15,640
The Nizam is gone. No more
trouble from Razakars or cops.

870
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,560
Our land is now part of
the Indian Union.

871
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:20,320
We, too, must join the Union.

872
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:23,400
We must return the lands
to the Zamindars.

873
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:27,240
The people and Zamindars
must live like brothers.

874
02:11:27,320 --> 02:11:31,000
We must stop the struggle
and maintain peace.

875
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:33,600
This is what was said
in Pirlapalli.

876
02:11:34,840 --> 02:11:36,440
We must think about it.

877
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:40,240
What's there to think about? Think!
Might as well garland the Doras!

878
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:42,800
Carry them in a parade!

879
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:47,880
Wait, Nagayya. Why get so impatient?

880
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:50,040
Elders say impatience gets
you nowhere.

881
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:54,600
Ugh, Elders! We'll not give up
land nor let the Dora return.

882
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:57,680
Listen well to what I say.

883
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:01,800
Even if God comes down,
I'll not give up my land!

884
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:05,800
We're not waiting with
folded hands to welcome them.

885
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:09,800
This concerns us all.
We must all stand united.

886
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:12,200
What do you think?

887
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:21,960
It's like we climbed up a
ladder only to be pushed off.

888
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:24,880
It's back to misery again.

889
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,920
A three-day wonder,
as I expected!

890
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:30,360
We fought hard to reclaim our
land. And now, you talk this way?

891
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:31,920
Some integrity!

892
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,640
Stop being impatient.
Let others speak.

893
02:12:34,760 --> 02:12:38,120
Yes, how can all of us
get so carried away?

894
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:41,000
We must weigh
the pros and cons.

895
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:43,440
You speak, Sathi Reddy.

896
02:12:44,320 --> 02:12:46,520
We're all pulling in
different directions.

897
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:50,960
We can't be hasty. No point
in being wise after the fact.

898
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:53,280
The Nizam is gone anyway.

899
02:12:53,680 --> 02:12:56,680
How many have we lost
in this struggle?

900
02:12:57,240 --> 02:13:00,080
Our life is so hard
and brutish.

901
02:13:00,200 --> 02:13:03,280
I think it's better to stop
the struggle.

902
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:06,440
Why get into this at all, then?
You should have kept mum.

903
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:11,000
Is this some practice fight?
Stop, he says!

904
02:13:11,320 --> 02:13:13,400
We shall never give up our land.

905
02:13:13,480 --> 02:13:15,880
Think! How can we
retain it?

906
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:17,920
You know, Uncle.

907
02:13:18,400 --> 02:13:21,320
That villain won't let us
live if he comes back here.

908
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:24,400
We'll die twice!
Then let's die now.

909
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:28,280
That's true enough.

910
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:32,800
Our life will go back to
misery if we let the Dora return.

911
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:34,360
He's right.

912
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:37,120
That's true.

913
02:13:45,240 --> 02:13:48,360
No giving up our land!
- Or letting the Dora back in!

914
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:50,720
What's destined will happen!
- Wait!

915
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:55,920
What will be, will be.
Your thoughts, Elder?

916
02:14:12,320 --> 02:14:15,320
So be it.
We can't stop fate.

917
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:44,920
<i>Though the guns boom...</i>

918
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:49,400
<i>And bombs rain down...</i>

919
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:54,920
<i>Don't lower the flag
we hold aloft</i>

920
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:03,520
<i>Hail, our flag of victory!</i>

921
02:18:11,520 --> 02:18:14,480
<i>Dedicated to all who died
in the Telangana struggle.</i>
