1
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,415
Oh, my God!

2
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,670
Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you give me your location?

3
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,547
Clearly, people here want some answers.

4
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:46,842
- Breaking news...
- We have confirmed...

5
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:49,425
- And the robbery happened around...
- At this time, information...

6
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,636
...don't go near this area.

7
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,971
...into the buildings here behind us...

8
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:58,392
The question on everyone's mind is how did
this situation get out of control here?

9
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,524
...so the pictures you're seeing,
this is a major incident.

10
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,026
...police have a suspect in custody.

11
00:01:04,106 --> 00:01:06,234
What drives a person to commit a crime?

12
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,656
To destroy? To weaken someone's resolve?

13
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,115
Vengeance? Spite?

14
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,450
Religion?

15
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:16,661
Money?

16
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,121
Communities, cities, entire countries

17
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,294
are put beneath microscopes
and analyzed for their flaws,

18
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,589
their weaknesses, so that one individual

19
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,592
can find the smallest chink
in the system's armor

20
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,175
and benefit from it.

21
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,267
Clearly, this has been done
by an explosives expert.

22
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,561
- Police say...
- My name is Lucas Nolan.

23
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,394
I'm an interrogation specialist.

24
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,605
I elicit useful information
from a suspect,

25
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:50,614
build a rapport, and utilize
any techniques necessary to gather data.

26
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,822
At least, that's what the book says.

27
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,372
I'm good at it.

28
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,035
No, I'm great at it...

29
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,541
Peeling away every layer
of a person's mind

30
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,919
and uncovering a clue
at the root of a problem.

31
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,084
And if you know what you're looking for...

32
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:11,428
you can prevent it
all from ever happening.

33
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:19,061
Shots fired! Shots fired!
Code 236, we're under fire!

34
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,529
Shots fired! Shots fired!

35
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,198
Officer pinned down, taking heavy fire!
Need backup!

36
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,868
All units, all units, please respond.
Officers need assistance.

37
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:41,328
Shots fired. Go to this location:
2543 North 6th Avenue.

38
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,039
All units, officers need assistance.
Shots fired.

39
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,928
Where the hell is that backup?

40
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:55,267
Who the hell are you?

41
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,181
Nolan, FBI. What do we got?

42
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,935
Suspect robbed the Bank of America.
Tracked his car here.

43
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:22,036
Four seconds a clip.
Probably an M4 automatic.

44
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,958
Five seconds to reload.

45
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,387
Hope he's consistent.

46
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,222
Hey, where are you going?

47
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,560
One, two, three, four...

48
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,500
- What the hell is he doing?
- I have no idea.

49
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:14,012
One, two, three, four.

50
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,143
Four seconds. You're out.

51
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:22,320
Shit.

52
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,072
How'd you know he was out?

53
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,873
Lucky guess.

54
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,081
Can I help you?

55
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,883
Are you in charge of bomb threats?

56
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,590
- Excuse me?
- You know,

57
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,468
this bomb is going to go off
at this place, at this time.

58
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,767
You should be really scared type of thing.

59
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:11,185
When exactly is this bomb gonna go off?

60
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,438
Now.

61
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,948
Show me your hands.
Show me your hands now!

62
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,202
Son of a bitch.

63
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:32,126
On the ground. On your knees now!

64
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,472
All right, go through.

65
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:53,268
- Next. ID?
- Good to go.

66
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,602
- How bad is it?
- No casualties, but bad enough.

67
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,562
Sixty square blocks with no electricity.

68
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,067
It'll take at least 12 hours
to get it back online.

69
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,149
Good news, we still got power.

70
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,486
That's not good news.
We could have the day off.

71
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,036
Yeah, I heard that.

72
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,368
Next. All right, go through.

73
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,168
Next.

74
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:35,769
We should get this started.

75
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,945
A man who gives himself up like that
knows he's about to be interrogated.

76
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:44,942
- Who's our guy?
- He's a memory savant.

77
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,652
He remembers anything and everything.

78
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,324
And he plays back highlights
in his mind better than ESPN.

79
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,532
He's a walking, talking encyclopedia.

80
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,037
Never pretends he has
more knowledge than the suspect

81
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,744
to gain the upper hand because he does.

82
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:58,171
How is that possible?

83
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:02,712
- What'd I miss?
- Nice of you to join us.

84
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,631
Luke, you know Special Agent Sara Ward.

85
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,554
Anti-terror, right?

86
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,763
So what do we got on this guy?

87
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,139
Not much.

88
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,392
- Prints?
- Nope.

89
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,144
- He filed them off.
- Or burned them.

90
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,647
We're running his face through
the Bureau databases right now,

91
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,900
- but so far...
- I get it.

92
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,328
We got one wallet, empty.
Some kind of paint smudge on it

93
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,911
and a key with the letters
"MS" scratched onto it.

94
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,295
- How much time I got?
- You don't.

95
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,551
You think there's another bomb out there?

96
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,353
You two better be right about him.

97
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,505
I'm Lucas Nolan.

98
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,556
What's your name?

99
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,469
You tell me.

100
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,231
You read people for a living, don't you?

101
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,732
Dave. No, or is it Bob?

102
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,777
Or maybe a good old Tommy.

103
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,485
- You don't look like a Tommy.
- Mm.

104
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,616
I read books. Far less annoying.

105
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,619
Then let's talk about books.

106
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,327
"If a tree falls in a park
and there is no one to hear,

107
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,375
it is silent, invisible, nameless.

108
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,045
If we were to vanish,
there would be no tree at all.

109
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,969
All meaning would vanish along with us."

110
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,426
Let's talk about books now.

111
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,135
What's he doing?

112
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,686
Searching his memory house.

113
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,437
Am I the only one in here who doesn't know
what the fuck a memory house is?

114
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,270
It's a memorization technique.

115
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,025
You see, our visual memory
is the strongest,

116
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,445
so Lucas has created a home in his mind
to remember anything and everything.

117
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,402
That sounds like bullshit to me.

118
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,156
"If a tree falls in the park...

119
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,623
If we were to vanish,
there would be no tree at all.

120
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,126
All meaning would vanish..."

121
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,171
William Fossett.

122
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:54,300
Natural States,
originally published in 1754.

123
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,719
However, he stole his line
of thinking from Berkeley,

124
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,676
who asked the same question
44 years earlier

125
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,388
with his Treatise on the Principles
of Human Knowledge.

126
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,645
Section 45, if you wanna have a look.

127
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,564
He's a game-changer.

128
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,781
So you are familiar with the work.

129
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,615
It is a simple question, really.

130
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,823
Either you believe physical phenomena

131
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:23,877
can exist outside the realm
of human perception or you don't.

132
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,633
Come on. You must have an opinion.

133
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,258
I'll answer one of your questions,
you answer one of mine.

134
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,302
Sure.

135
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,386
- Where were you born?
- That's his question?

136
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:43,057
Iraq.

137
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,266
Match up immigration records,
photos, whatever you got.

138
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,441
Got it.

139
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,442
Iran, Syria, Egypt, Gaza.

140
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,274
He's playing us.

141
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,734
Does it matter?

142
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,321
Would you even be able
to tell the difference?

143
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,701
- Hmm?
- Okay.

144
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:05,622
- So you came here when you were...
- Ah, ah, ah.

145
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,374
You're going to have to
earn your next question.

146
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,876
I don't have time for games.

147
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,550
No, you don't,
but you're going to play anyway.

148
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:18,176
- What do you want?
- I want to be heard.

149
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:21,930
But for that to happen,
I need someone to listen.

150
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,728
And if I don't?

151
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:29,479
You'll find out in 27 minutes.

152
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,811
Becky?

153
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,063
Done.

154
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,110
America doesn't negotiate with terrorists.

155
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,945
It does today. And there are rules.

156
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,200
Do we understand each other?

157
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,952
I understand.

158
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,000
Good.

159
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,624
The rules are simple.

160
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:55,336
They are based on truth
in a world where everybody lies.

161
00:13:55,418 --> 00:14:00,093
With the biggest liars winning elections
and the greediest companies thriving,

162
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:06,055
I am going to tell you the truth
about who I am and what I want.

163
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:10,859
Then I'm going to ask you a question
based on that truth.

164
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,398
You get it right, you win a prize.

165
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,280
You get it wrong, people die right now.

166
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,032
I want electronic countermeasures
on this building.

167
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,614
No wireless signals in or out.

168
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,074
Got it.

169
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:33,040
This whole nightmare of a country
is built on lies.

170
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:37,463
Everywhere you look, women with fake tits.

171
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,592
You turn on the television,
all you see are reality shows,

172
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:46,845
homes none of us own, a leader who says
he's going to take care of people.

173
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,892
Online, you have a thousand friends,
and not one in real life.

174
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,849
All lies.

175
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,357
And do you know which ones are the worst?

176
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,274
The ones you come to believe.

177
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,701
And what is the biggest lie of all?

178
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,535
...the biggest lie of all.

179
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,713
The American Dream.

180
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,798
Well done.

181
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,092
For that, you get a prize.

182
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:28,554
- One question, one answer.
- Where's the next bomb gonna go off?

183
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,855
Corner of Nicollet and 5th.

184
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,435
Get PD to evac the buildings for one
square block and set up a hard perimeter.

185
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,607
I want SWAT and EOD
on Nicollet and 5th now.

186
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,400
What's there, Becky?

187
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,859
Offices, storefronts, a tower, apartments.

188
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,655
- Too much.
- What are you doing?

189
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,612
You can't just walk away from him.

190
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,660
- We're both coming with you.
- Absolutely not.

191
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,662
- Why did he come in here?
- What?

192
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:55,083
- Why did he give himself up?
- Because he's a psychopath.

193
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,459
Yes. No. Maybe.

194
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,166
But what he is doesn't matter.

195
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,627
Why did he come in here?
Why did he give himself up?

196
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,008
Why did he just tell us where the bomb is?

197
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,015
He doesn't think we'll find it in time.

198
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,222
And what, you think he's just
gonna show you where it is?

199
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:12,225
Yes, but not from in here.
I need him on-site.

200
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,807
He'll unconsciously give up more there

201
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,853
- than he ever would here.
- Oh, for Christ's sake.

202
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,773
What if he is just lying
to get out of here?

203
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,356
You're right. He is by definition,

204
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,736
but that doesn't mean a bomb
isn't about to go off.

205
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,781
If we wanna stop him, we have to
let him think he's in control.

206
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,364
And what if he is the one in control?

207
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,750
He's not.

208
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,873
Just let me do my thing.

209
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,174
He's coming with.

210
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,517
If this goes south, it's on you.

211
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,707
Hey, in here!

212
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,874
Exciting, isn't it?

213
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,630
Oh, come on.

214
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,424
You could be stuck at your desk
talking about the lousy weather

215
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,843
or how the T-wolves are losing again

216
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,642
or what poisonous fast food
you're going to pick up for lunch.

217
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,687
Stuck in the same bullshit conversations

218
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:27,319
with the same bullshit people
as every other day of your life.

219
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,702
Nothing like a ticking bomb
to get the blood pumping.

220
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,285
- Ever heard of a treadmill?
- Do I look like a hamster?

221
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,996
Do you really want to waste
your precious energy

222
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,377
spinning a wheel that goes nowhere?

223
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,764
The bigger the crime,
the bigger the challenge.

224
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,517
And everybody wants to beat the best.

225
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:04,397
The faster your precious promotion,
your hollow pay-raise comes.

226
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,479
What do you think?

227
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,151
I think you talk too much.

228
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,656
Hey, it's just my two cents.

229
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:23,040
I wish you'd chose a different path 'cause
there was a fork in your road somewhere.

230
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,668
You think you're walking
the righteous path, the right path,

231
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:28,126
but you're not. Your map's all wrong.

232
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,505
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,

233
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,589
but this path is just gonna
see you at the bottom of a grave.

234
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,178
And how can you be so sure?

235
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,260
Because I've seen others
walk it before you.

236
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,683
Just my two cents.

237
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,197
Road clear. Area has been evacuated.

238
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,154
- Explosives team is on the way.
- On the way?

239
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,801
Get the barrier!

240
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,601
Move! Let's go, let's go!

241
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:07,892
Four minutes.

242
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,314
How do you wanna play it?

243
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,318
Let's see your work
up close and personal, shall we?

244
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,364
What are you doing?

245
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,074
My job. What are you doing?

246
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,620
You better not screw this up.

247
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,873
I wasn't planning on it, but thank you.

248
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,249
- What now?
- We walk.

249
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,504
Then you take this.
Keep the receiver open.

250
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,382
I wanna hear everything.

251
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,974
You ever consider maybe
I'm not afraid to die?

252
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,269
You think I'm just
going to tell you where it is?

253
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,350
You already have.

254
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,811
Here I am, an open book,

255
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:56,524
all the information right there in front
of you, and still you need my help.

256
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,821
You don't want this bomb
to go off any more than I do.

257
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,030
- And why would that be?
- 'Cause you're not done yet.

258
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,159
No.

259
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,660
Who are these innocents to you?

260
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,082
Do they really mean anything to you?

261
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,792
But, more importantly,
do you mean anything to them?

262
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,046
Do you think any one of them
would stop on the street

263
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,049
and give you a quarter
if you were starving?

264
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:23,639
No. You're not doing this for them.

265
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,515
A town like these people,
you are far too intelligent

266
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,559
to lie to yourself
about what you really are.

267
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,142
You know the truth about yourself.

268
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,022
What's that?

269
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,275
You're having fun.

270
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,283
Lucas.

271
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:50,162
I am going to tell you the
truth about who I am and what I want.

272
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:56,593
This whole goddamn nightmare of
a country is built on lies.

273
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,673
Women with fake tits.

274
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,054
All you see are reality shows,

275
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:08,599
a leader who says he's going
to take care of people.

276
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,977
Online, you have a thousand friends,
and not one in real life.

277
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,480
All lies.

278
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,689
What is the biggest lie of all?

279
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,444
Everybody knows a house
is nothing without a neighborhood.

280
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,072
Talk to us about
your mortgage options today.

281
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:26,156
Live your dream. The American Dream.

282
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,036
What is the biggest lie of all?

283
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,993
The American Dream.

284
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,957
Mortgage office.

285
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,044
Mortgage office, let's go!

286
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,098
- Guess you're a hero now, Lucas.
- Am I?

287
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,225
You are if you believe in causality.

288
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:19,229
Cause and effect, you fire a gun,
the bullet hits something or someone.

289
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,562
You cross the wrong man,
he wants to kill you.

290
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,693
You disarm a bomb, you become a hero.

291
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,781
The thing about causality
is that it cuts both ways.

292
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:37,246
Given a different effect, the same cause
can make a hero into a fool.

293
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,010
Hey, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing? Hey, hey!

294
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,435
Get down!

295
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,070
Where did he go?

296
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,314
Can you see him? Can you see him?

297
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,616
Don't let him get away!

298
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,712
Okay, okay!

299
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,715
I'm out.

300
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,684
Drop it.

301
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:09,733
On your knees. Now!

302
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,531
Okay.

303
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,808
Nobody move!

304
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:28,483
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Hands up now! Hands up!

305
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,835
We're training your mind, Lucas,
so you can do anything.

306
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,087
Washington, Jefferson,
Buchanan, and Coolidge.

307
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,044
Good.

308
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,552
And now tell me, when you go
inside your memory house,

309
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,760
is there anything more beautiful?

310
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:06,642
Yes. A real house.

311
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,894
Money isn't everything, Lucas.

312
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:11,396
- God will provide...
- Well, can He buy us a house

313
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,398
or a car or clothes?

314
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,821
Because you can't.

315
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,421
Dad, what did you do?

316
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,840
Dad, it was my fault. I'm sorry.

317
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:34,644
Why didn't you shoot him, Lucas?

318
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,234
Because he has more bombs out there.

319
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,116
- All right, Becky, what did he do?
- Not sure.

320
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:50,746
- Whatever this is, it's encrypted.
- Well, if you had to guess.

321
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,914
Well, this office is a data hub,

322
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,042
so that means the servers
connect to bank alarm systems,

323
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:56,460
to hospitals, to the airport.

324
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,588
Might be information or a virus.

325
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,840
I won't know until
I crack the code and pull it apart.

326
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,134
Well, if it was a virus,
wouldn't the firewall stop it?

327
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,178
He was already in the system.

328
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:10,599
So you're telling us that
whatever he did can't be stopped?

329
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,558
Yeah, short of unplugging everything
and causing a complete shutdown

330
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,690
in our financial, health, security,
and transportation system? No.

331
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,191
Get back to the office.
Do whatever you have to do.

332
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,447
- Just crack it.
- On it.

333
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,290
He's done.

334
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,411
He's just starting.

335
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,334
He's lived his entire life
for this moment. You understand that?

336
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:42,170
What I understand is that we've done
exactly what he wanted us to do.

337
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:44,800
I'm taking over this interrogation.

338
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,176
Then you might as well
tell everybody to go home

339
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:48,929
and start praying right now
because you're not gonna stop him.

340
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,348
And you are?

341
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:56,144
He has been toying with you since the minute
you walked into that interrogation room.

342
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,689
Two hours, and we know
exactly nothing about him.

343
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:03,399
Not his name, where he lives,
what he wants, what his next target is.

344
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,612
You're missing the point.

345
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,906
It's not who his name is or what he wants

346
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,991
or even what he's gonna blow up next
because that is going to happen.

347
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,956
Get him the hell out of here.

348
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,135
Go home, Luke.

349
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:31,560
Have a drink. We'll take it from here.

350
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,556
Luke.

351
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,407
Lucas.

352
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:03,753
What the hell are you doing?

353
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,797
- I know where he lives.
- You got an address?

354
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,879
No, but I'll get you
within a quarter mile.

355
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:14,182
- I'll bet my career on it.
- You just did. Well, let's go!

356
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:06,107
No one in there is going to talk to you
with me looking like this.

357
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,859
Come on, this is undignified.

358
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,031
Yeah.

359
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,785
Well, here's your dignity.

360
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,996
Hey, friend, spare a dollar?

361
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,414
Hey!

362
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,122
- Bullshit.
- Hey, man.

363
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,173
Special Agent Bennett.

364
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,713
So?

365
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:14,009
So... ass-face,

366
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:17,053
I want you to tell me
if you have seen this man before.

367
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,931
No.

368
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,516
You sure about that?

369
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,647
Someone not quite
so rosy white walks in here,

370
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,065
I'm pretty sure you'd remember that.

371
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,734
I'm sure.

372
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:34,904
If that face showed up in here,
I'd remember.

373
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,700
So whatever you assholes
came in here for, it ain't here,

374
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,495
so why don't you do a little 180
and get the hell out of my bar?

375
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:45,829
Unlike you, most people know
where they're not wanted.

376
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,289
Mm.

377
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,335
So what do you make of that?

378
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,637
Looks like he was exactly
where he was wanted.

379
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:05,182
Whoo!

380
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,193
So you believe all this garbage?

381
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,526
What, that whites are superior?

382
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,077
Mm-hmm. Better.

383
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,242
You know, I read a lot.

384
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,870
Even disgusting crap like Mein Kampf.

385
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,577
You know what I know for sure?

386
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,459
Is that behind hate is fear.

387
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,500
You're just a coward.

388
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:37,261
Yeah, behind all this bravado,
you're just a scared little cunt.

389
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,679
- Hey, don't move!
- Stay back!

390
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,557
- Don't move!
- Sit down. Now.

391
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,851
- Don't move.
- I know you've seen him.

392
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,434
Fuck you!

393
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,020
- Hey!
- Don't move.

394
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,355
Sit down.

395
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:59,614
What about you? Have you seen him?

396
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,696
'Cause I've got all day
to bounce your head off this bar.

397
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,534
Yeah, I've seen him a few times.

398
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,038
Where does he live?

399
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:10,458
- I know the dude. I don't fuck him.
- Why was he here?

400
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:13,007
I'm guessing it wasn't for
the hospitality and hors d'oeuvres.

401
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,257
- Freeze!
- Don't move.

402
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:23,893
The feds, man! Heads up!

403
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,339
Detonators.

404
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,351
Thanks, man.

405
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,943
Well, that was stupid.

406
00:40:39,094 --> 00:40:40,396
Probably.

407
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,443
No, definitely.

408
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,653
You should've waited for backup.
You're too smart to let it get personal.

409
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:49,285
You get stupid again and you're out.

410
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,076
The detonators are military grade.

411
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,537
- Digital timers.
- Explosives?

412
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,292
- Nothing.
- What do you mean nothing?

413
00:40:57,372 --> 00:41:00,587
This place is clean.
No explosives anywhere inside.

414
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,463
You gotta give me
something better than that.

415
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:06,009
Well, one of the detonator units
was missing from the box.

416
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,387
- That's the best I got.
- Shit.

417
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,763
I'm gonna go see if they know anything.

418
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:11,969
Mm-hmm.

419
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,639
They won't know anything more.

420
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:18,226
He kept his bomb components separate
so only one can be compromised at a time.

421
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,563
But he lives close.
I bet we'll find our explosives there.

422
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,694
- How can you be sure?
- He has no ID, no driver's license.

423
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:28,364
He doesn't come up on any CCTV matches,
so he doesn't take the bus or train.

424
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,117
Too much surveillance.

425
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,335
You keeping it together, Luke?

426
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,462
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

427
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,466
'Cause you don't look fine.

428
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,180
Come on, this is undignified.

429
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,307
I've seen him a few times.

430
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:55,639
Where does he live?

431
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:58,019
Do you think any one of them
would stop on the street

432
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,976
and give you a quarter
if you were starving?

433
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,777
Unbelievable.

434
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,493
No, I've never seen him before.

435
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,041
What's he doing?

436
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,670
Proving that no good deed goes unpunished.

437
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,504
Oh, thanks.

438
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:29,842
Yeah, he lives right around the corner...

439
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,595
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go.

440
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,347
Prepare to move.
Follow where they're going.

441
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:36,600
You're the boss. Let's go.

442
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,569
Talk to me.

443
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,989
Had one wallet, empty.

444
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,783
...a key with the letters
"MS" scratched on it.

445
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:56,491
...a key with the letters
"MS" scratched on it.

446
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,326
"MS" was scratched into the key, right?

447
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,546
Melissa Smith, apartment 34.

448
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,423
Wait.

449
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,842
He's smarter than this. He wanted us here.

450
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:15,143
It's either part of the game
he has us playing or it's a trap.

451
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,139
I want EOD at Jackson and Grant now.

452
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,734
Yep, I got it.

453
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,652
All right, just got a hit
on Melissa Smith.

454
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,196
She's 35, clerical worker,
unmarried, no children.

455
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:34,741
Facebook page says she
likes cats and Internet dating.

456
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,949
No Social Security, no driver's license.

457
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,619
It's an alias. She doesn't exist.

458
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,039
Perfect alias. Wouldn't raise any flags.

459
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,497
Okay, guys, this is taking too long.

460
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,456
Almost there.

461
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,542
We're all good. No booby traps.

462
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,719
- We still need a warrant.
- Yeah, you get on that, Sara.

463
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,167
What are they?

464
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:12,753
Power grid. Water mains.
Gas lines. Internet.

465
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,714
He's got a blueprint
to the entire city's infrastructure.

466
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,676
Bring him up.

467
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,230
- This is a crime scene.
- The real crime hasn't happened yet.

468
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,316
Do it.

469
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,566
Bring him up.

470
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,088
What are you?

471
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,214
Let's find out.

472
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,606
Well, make yourselves at home.

473
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:17,442
Uh, be careful with that, please.

474
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:22,366
- Well?
- You're jerking me around.

475
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:24,368
You're only starting to figure that out?

476
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,325
But you led us here on purpose.

477
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:30,124
Who says I led you anywhere?
You're calling the shots.

478
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,081
What I do know is that
you want me to keep playing.

479
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,629
You've already lost.

480
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:38,589
Well, then you won't mind if I walk.
It's hard playing against yourself.

481
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,926
Okay.

482
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:50,142
I want you to keep playing.

483
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,603
Then you're gonna have to make this
much more interesting.

484
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:05,785
- What do you want?
- I want to change the world.

485
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:08,334
Is that why you paint?
To change your world?

486
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,998
The world's an ugly place.

487
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,001
You wanna make it beautiful, so you paint?

488
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:23,383
You need a blank canvas, am I right?

489
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:35,314
Everything around us is fake, Lucas.
Why shouldn't I burn it down?

490
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,738
You must've had a fucked-up childhood.

491
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:43,111
To end up like this, living like this,
I mean, you got some serious issues.

492
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,827
But we both know where they came from.

493
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,626
Really? And where is that, Lucas?

494
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,507
Women.

495
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,090
Did some woman break your heart?

496
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:07,388
Was it Mommy?

497
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:11,008
She didn't love you enough?

498
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:14,021
Whatever it is,
it's clear that you hate women.

499
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:18,776
You think you know me.
You don't know shit.

500
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:22,528
Just got a hit on Melissa Smith.

501
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,322
It's an alias. She doesn't exist.

502
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,115
She likes cats and Internet dating.

503
00:48:26,195 --> 00:48:28,284
...Internet dating.

504
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:30,742
Internet dating...

505
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,915
Wait, is that his laptop?

506
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,259
Not surprising. He used private browsing.

507
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,028
Nice hack. I see Becky's been
rubbing off on you a bit.

508
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,197
We need to get her on the phone right now.

509
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,788
- What's up?
- Beck, MNluvconnect.

510
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,956
Run any woman he might've met
in the last six months

511
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,165
against construction companies,
uh, demolition firms,

512
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:22,422
commercial contractors, anyone you can
cross-reference with explosives.

513
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:26,510
A password would be great.

514
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:33,057
Seems to me like you have
two options, Lucas.

515
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:36,016
You can get a warrant, or you can ask me.

516
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:40,189
Not enough time for one,
too much pride for the other.

517
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:43,648
Pity. You were doing so well.

518
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:54,033
If we wanna stop him, we have
to let him think he's in control.

519
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,086
Shit.

520
00:49:57,453 --> 00:49:59,125
Oh, now you've gone and done it.

521
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,419
- The fuck did you do, hmm?
- Nothing.

522
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:05,254
It was him. I'm sitting right here.
Fifty seconds and she blows, Lucas.

523
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,633
- Stop it.
- Shoot me.

524
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,802
- Throw it out the window.
- He can't do that.

525
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,384
He knows the answer he needs is inside.

526
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:15,433
He throws it out,
he has nothing, and I win.

527
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,607
Tick-took, tick-tock, brother.

528
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,186
Here I am, an open book

529
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,022
with all the information
right there in front of you.

530
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,858
"If a tree falls in the park
and there's no one to hear,

531
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:31,242
it is silent, invisible, and nameless."

532
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:42,256
- Philosophy.
- Do it.

533
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,901
This is seriously messed up.

534
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,945
And we are... in.

535
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:25,708
Got ya.

536
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:34,428
Yep. Thanks.

537
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,972
- Joan Marian.
- And I care why?

538
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:41,060
'Cause she's co-owner of Marian
Demolition, and their demo is explosives.

539
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,729
Her name came up
on our boy's little sex site.

540
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,148
- Where?
- Richmond.

541
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,354
Let's go.

542
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,113
Let's move!

543
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:04,272
Hey, you can't go in there!

544
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,269
Joan Marian? Special Agent Eric Bennett.

545
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:10,107
What is this about?

546
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,189
Oh, I think you have
a good idea what it's about.

547
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:19,614
Oh, God.

548
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:24,626
Is there anything
you wanna tell us, Mrs. Marian?

549
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:33,547
Um... I'm unhappy in my marriage.

550
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:36,050
I went on a dating website
and he pinged me,

551
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,882
and so we went out on a date...

552
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:41,060
I could give a shit about any of this.
Did he give you a name?

553
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,063
Vasti. Vasti Radan.

554
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,936
I'm on it.

555
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,768
Oh, God.

556
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:55,277
If I had known it was him,
I swear I would have turned him in.

557
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,109
How much did he take?

558
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,615
- A lot.
- Oh, Christ...

559
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:04,120
Show us, please.

560
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,925
It's like these drums here.

561
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:16,427
Take him outside.

562
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:24,598
Okay, so he stole two barrels off you.

563
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,392
A little over a week ago.

564
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:28,811
What kind? What's its application?

565
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,437
- It's the powder form.
- Go ahead.

566
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,064
It's highly conductive.

567
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:34,772
Add formaldehyde and you can
mold it into shaped charges

568
00:54:34,855 --> 00:54:36,983
or apply it to pretty much anything.

569
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,113
Like what?

570
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:42,241
Plaster, concrete, paper, paint even.

571
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:46,787
We use it mainly to pour into drilled,
reinforced concrete supports,

572
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:49,832
then let it dry for three days and then...

573
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:52,756
- ...we detonate.
- Oh, Christ.

574
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:55,459
Guys.

575
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,546
Don't move.

576
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,265
Vasti Radan. Very little on him.

577
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:09,224
We did get a hit on his father,
a Magid Radan.

578
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,146
Tax records show that he worked for
a private security agency

579
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,103
called Simons Security.

580
00:55:14,186 --> 00:55:17,401
It's basic rent-a-cop
that contracts out to federal agencies.

581
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,109
He was good for three years,
then he was found drunk on the job.

582
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:23,532
Company fired him,
he lost everything and more.

583
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:25,576
He was sued for unpaid debts.

584
00:55:25,656 --> 00:55:28,159
His home was foreclosed on.
He fell off the map.

585
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:31,621
Two years later, he was found
dead in an alley in Chinatown.

586
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:34,501
- So this is personal.
- Good.

587
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:38,380
- How the hell is any of this good?
- That means his targets aren't random.

588
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:43,051
There's a... a method behind them,
a logic pattern.

589
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:45,554
But what pattern? That's the question.

590
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,386
I'm not sure yet.

591
00:55:49,263 --> 00:55:51,436
All right, what do you wanna do?

592
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,605
Ask him.

593
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,241
Book her.

594
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:21,295
Do you miss your dad?

595
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:25,552
Hmm. She told you my name.

596
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:29,473
Yep. You wanted her to.

597
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:33,808
- And why would I do that?
- So I can figure out why you did it.

598
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:41,733
What you want is locked up in here.

599
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,068
I don't think you have the time...

600
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:50,033
or the talents to unlock this vault.

601
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,039
Seems a waste of water
to wash a car in the rain.

602
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:59,378
Power grid, water mains, gas lines.

603
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:02,007
He's got a blueprint to
the entire city's infrastructure.

604
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:10,597
- Hey, Why'd you turn the water off?
- Water mains.

605
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,556
Explosion reported. 935 5th Avenue.

606
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,440
- He just hit the...
- The water department.

607
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,522
And two substations.
They're shutting down the pumps.

608
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:25,610
- All of them. And without water...
- The fire department can't fight fires.

609
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,739
Eric, he is finished.

610
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,197
Get him in the car. We're taking him
back to the federal building.

611
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,701
What's it going to be, Lucas?

612
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,286
- More talking?
- No.

613
00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:36,957
I've done enough of that. It's your turn.

614
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,876
Tell me everything I know.

615
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,833
You know my father was a drunk.

616
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,755
He was fired from his job
and lost everything.

617
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,133
And you know or should know or will know

618
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:48,966
that my mother died six months after that.

619
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:53,515
I lived on the streets and was forced
to fend for myself, educate myself.

620
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:57,975
Everything I am today is because
of a system of people like you.

621
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:02,482
You know that I have over a thousand pounds
of high explosives somewhere in the city

622
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,526
and that I am not afraid to detonate them.

623
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:08,071
But what you don't know
is where or really why.

624
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,324
Now, you can take me
to Gitmo and torture me,

625
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,492
but we both know that won't work.

626
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:13,824
And you can even offer me money,

627
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,877
but you know I would only laugh
in your smug face.

628
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:22,961
Hey, hey, hey, come on!
Get him off! Get off!

629
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,088
- Come on!
- Lucas! Lucas!

630
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,590
Get him in the car.

631
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,343
You take yourself so seriously.

632
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:33,929
Go home. That's an order. Go.

633
00:58:44,688 --> 00:58:46,610
Got a wallet with some kind of
paint smudge on it.

634
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,613
It's a powder form. Highly conductive.

635
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:52,407
Add formaldehyde and you can
mold it into shaped charges

636
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,826
or apply it to pretty much anything.

637
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,328
Like what?

638
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:58,376
...paint even.

639
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,584
Paint.

640
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:04,086
Some kind of paint smudge on it.

641
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,228
I gotta go.

642
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:22,771
Hey, hey!

643
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,774
It's okay, let him go.

644
00:59:30,859 --> 00:59:32,361
What are you doing here, Lucas?

645
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:33,821
- Evidence.
- What?

646
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,781
Vasti Radan's wallet. I need it.

647
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,959
Lucas, you can't take that.

648
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:42,458
I need an explosives test kit.

649
00:59:54,883 --> 00:59:56,226
There you are.

650
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,349
- What are you doing?
- Just give me a minute.

651
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,841
The paint. He mixed explosives with paint.

652
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,297
- A building?
- Maybe.

653
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:32,340
There's over 200,000 in the city alone.

654
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,259
It'll take months to check
every single one of them.

655
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,716
We need to find out where he worked.

656
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:36,887
It would have something
to do with painting.

657
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:40,182
Commercial painting, uh,
I need you to find out where.

658
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:42,100
There's no job records,
there's no EDD filings,

659
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,932
there's no tax records for a Vasti Radan.

660
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,729
- He used an alias.
- What alias?

661
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:48,106
I need a name.

662
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:50,314
Let's talk about books, then.

663
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:54,071
"If a tree falls in the park
and there is no one to hear..."

664
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,494
William Fossett.

665
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:01,745
A William Fossett
was terminated from his position

666
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:04,453
at a commercial painting company
after starting three days ago.

667
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:10,212
His employer, Bleaker Paint Works,

668
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:14,132
filed a charge for a trespass
and illegal entry into their warehouse.

669
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,510
Seems like he stole some supplies.

670
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,057
When the PD checked the address,
it didn't exist.

671
01:01:22,137 --> 01:01:24,390
I need his most job recent site, Beck.

672
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:34,441
They were contracted to paint
the inside of the Federal Reserve Bank.

673
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:38,449
- You did it, Lucas.
- I didn't.

674
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:40,614
- Get Eric.
- Yeah.

675
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,043
No answer. Shit.

676
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:56,550
I was starting to think
you weren't going to make it.

677
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,650
How are you holding up, buddy?

678
01:02:12,062 --> 01:02:13,439
Wanna tell me
what the hell you're doing, Lucas?

679
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:15,694
- Solving a case.
- No, you're the case now.

680
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,401
Bring him back, turn yourself in.

681
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:19,111
- Can't do that, Eric.
- We talked to Becky.

682
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,697
We know about the Federal Reserve.
EOD teams are en route now.

683
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,032
They won't find it.

684
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,703
- What are you talking about?
- The paint.

685
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,785
It takes three days to dry.
He quit three days ago.

686
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,541
He's gonna detonate it and he doesn't
think we can stop him in time.

687
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:32,044
Hold on, hold on!

688
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,469
Shit.

689
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,846
Okay, so what do you wanna do?

690
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,554
I'm gonna give him a choice:
life or death.

691
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,851
You wanna take him inside?

692
01:02:47,931 --> 01:02:49,853
About America. How unfair it is.

693
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,646
So he wants to burn
the Federal Reserve to the ground.

694
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:53,523
But I don't think he's willing
to die to make his point.

695
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,823
- And if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

696
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,745
Go, go, go, go, go!

697
01:03:10,704 --> 01:03:12,297
Stop backseat driving!

698
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,588
Maybe he's onto something.
He hasn't steered us wrong yet.

699
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:18,715
Yeah, well, he hasn't steered us
right yet either.

700
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,298
Priority command,
Special Agent Lucas Nolan.

701
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:23,970
He's heading to the Federal Reserve
with a suspected terrorist.

702
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,643
I want them stopped.

703
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:58,801
Freeze!

704
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,509
Put your hands up! Knees!

705
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,057
Now!

706
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:13,478
Put it down! Drop it!

707
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,980
- Drop it!
- You drop it!

708
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,482
Freeze! I'm FBI.

709
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:21,692
- You put it down!
- I said drop it! Now! Now!

710
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:29,328
Kick it over.

711
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:26,765
Get up.

712
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,932
That was fun.

713
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:46,360
Just act normal or I'll shoot you.

714
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:50,658
Lucas Nolan, FBI.
I need to speak to someone in charge.

715
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:53,491
Edward Watson, building facility manager.

716
01:05:53,575 --> 01:05:56,039
Everyone's cleared out
of the building now.

717
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,917
Okay, good. Was the bank painted recently?

718
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:00,585
Uh, yes.

719
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:02,542
How much of the bank
was painted, Mr. Watson?

720
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:05,754
Well, everything.
Over 200,000 square feet.

721
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:09,091
- How much time do we have?
- Not enough.

722
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:13,556
What you want is locked up in here.

723
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:18,983
I don't think you have the time
or the talents to unlock this vault.

724
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,023
Did they paint the vault?

725
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:23,730
- Uh, yes.
- Take us there, please.

726
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,281
Uh, this way.

727
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:29,364
- Do you still have power?
- Uh, some.

728
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:32,033
Backup generator's enough
to run basic systems.

729
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,160
- Surveillance cameras?
- Uh, no.

730
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,414
Not until power's restored,
but that won't happen till 6:00 PM.

731
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,042
Check down there.

732
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,590
Down here.

733
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:47,587
Tell me about the vault.

734
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,845
Thirty feet of reinforced steel,
set 60 feet below street level.

735
01:06:51,925 --> 01:06:54,848
It's designed to be almost
impregnable from outside attack.

736
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,680
So how much is in there?

737
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:01,104
Twenty billion in coin and currency
come through here every year.

738
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:05,314
Right now at the end of the month,
close to three billion.

739
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,444
Exterior doors are
electronically controlled.

740
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,947
No getting in or out
unless the guard inside knows you.

741
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,241
Watson, Edward.

742
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:14,698
This way.

743
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,452
Open it, please.

744
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:39,097
Please. The currency
is surrounded by an electrical field.

745
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,434
If you touch even a single bill,
full lockdown will occur.

746
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:49,779
No detonator.

747
01:07:51,442 --> 01:07:52,906
God damn it, Lucas.

748
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:54,908
Take your weapon out,
put it on the ground.

749
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:57,702
- Now!
- The paint is the explosive.

750
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:00,121
We gotta stop this.
It's gonna blow somehow.

751
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:02,624
The detonator, it's in here.

752
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,206
Check it out.

753
01:08:08,251 --> 01:08:10,298
Explosive is confirmed.

754
01:08:10,378 --> 01:08:11,925
I'm not picking up a detonator.

755
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,426
I'm not finding any detonators either.

756
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:15,178
Okay, what else is in here besides money?

757
01:08:15,258 --> 01:08:20,058
Plates and electronic currency
wiring stations in there.

758
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:23,057
- What for?
- We can wire money anywhere in the world.

759
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:24,562
All you need is an account number.

760
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:27,020
Can you feel it, Lucas?

761
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:32,109
The energy is positively electric.
We're so close, I can taste it.

762
01:08:32,191 --> 01:08:35,070
Can you? No?

763
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:39,202
Maybe you should try harder.
How am I going to do it?

764
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:42,661
How am I going to detonate
all this explosive?

765
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:47,919
I've given you the answer,
all the tells, everything you need.

766
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:52,254
Now, impress me.
How am I going to get away with it?

767
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:54,135
Or am I?

768
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,675
You still have surveillance cameras?

769
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,097
No, not until power is restored.

770
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:01,516
We heard that's gonna happen at 6:00 PM.

771
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:03,269
6:00 PM.

772
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:10,860
Eric, does your cell phone work?

773
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,072
No.

774
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,575
Mr. Watson, do you have
a phone line to the outside?

775
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,248
Uh, there.

776
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:34,129
- Hey.
- Do you have Joan Marian?

777
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,134
- She's in interview three.
- I need to talk to her.

778
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,387
- Now?
- Yes, now. Right now.

779
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:47,941
It's Lucas Nolan.

780
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,065
- Yes?
- Mrs. Marian,

781
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,942
you said the explosives
were highly conductive.

782
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,275
- Conductive of what?
- Electricity.

783
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:57,947
That's how we detonate it.
We use electrical current.

784
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,575
There's electrical current everywhere.
Why is it stable?

785
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:02,032
It's because of the differentials.

786
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,584
It responds to rapid
fluctuations in current.

787
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,879
The building's the detonator.

788
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:14,297
It's gonna blow
when the power comes back on.

789
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:18,301
We need to get out of here. Eric, now!

790
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,803
Okay, I was wrong about him.
I didn't understand.

791
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,260
I thought he cared about living.
He doesn't.

792
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,846
In order for his plan to work,
he needs to die.

793
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,100
Oh, Christ.

794
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:28,103
Okay, this vault is gonna blow at 6:00.

795
01:10:29,842 --> 01:10:31,564
No, no, no.

796
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:35,443
Shh. Well done. I must say I am impressed.

797
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:37,320
- Let her go.
- Then they'll shoot me.

798
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,653
- Fine, then take me.
- Why?

799
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,910
Because I'm willing to pay the price.
These people aren't. She's not.

800
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:46,584
Okay. Walk towards me.

801
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:53,375
Slowly. Slowly.

802
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:55,677
- Take the shot if you get it.
- Copy that.

803
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:04,595
Now the lesson is over. Now go.

804
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,392
- We're not fucking moving anywhere.
- You need to get out of here now!

805
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:09,725
- Not without you.
- Eric, go!

806
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,274
Emergency. Vault shutdown.

807
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:19,696
- Move! Out! Out now!
- I'm sorry.

808
01:11:19,776 --> 01:11:21,403
- I am so sorry.
- Go, go.

809
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:24,742
Eric, now!

810
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,699
- I'm not gonna fucking leave you here!
- Eric, go!

811
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,161
- Go! It's closing! Go!
- God damn it.

812
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:32,789
God damn it!

813
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,093
- Hey.
- Becky, what did you hear?

814
01:11:42,173 --> 01:11:44,637
The explosive is triggered
by electrical current fluctuations.

815
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,264
Okay, get with
the power company right now.

816
01:11:46,344 --> 01:11:48,472
Tell them not to turn the power back on.

817
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:51,519
That wasn't 2,000 pounds of anything.

818
01:11:51,599 --> 01:11:53,771
- Maybe he's alive.
- Open the door.

819
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,690
- I can't.
- Open the goddamn door!

820
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:58,359
I can't! Nobody can.
Not until an hour after lockdown.

821
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,362
Oh, Jesus!

822
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:02,819
I need welders down here now.

823
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:06,451
- Becky?
- I can't do anything. I'm on hold.

824
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:08,408
God damn it!

825
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,420
Please tell me he's gonna be all right.

826
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,377
Everything's gonna be fine.

827
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,439
What the hell?

828
01:13:29,447 --> 01:13:30,993
My computer just shut down.

829
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,870
Same here. It's erasing the files.

830
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:34,918
Damn it.

831
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:39,919
What's happening, guys?

832
01:13:39,999 --> 01:13:42,752
The virus, it's wiping the servers,
the backups, everything.

833
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,712
Shit.

834
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:50,221
Four bombs and only two casualties.

835
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:51,803
- It appears...
- Special Agent Lucas Nolan

836
01:13:51,886 --> 01:13:54,976
is credited with saving the lives
of numerous federal agents and local...

837
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:58,104
Estimates put the paper losses
in the range of $3 billion,

838
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,687
- however, as the money never...
- FBI's Minneapolis office

839
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,316
experienced a cyber attack.

840
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:04,360
Their secured servers
systematically erased all data,

841
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:07,910
including records involving
suspected bomber Vasti Radan.

842
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:28,467
I'm honored to give the eulogy

843
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:31,300
for Lucas Nolan today.

844
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,307
A colleague...

845
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:36,973
and a close friend.

846
01:14:37,056 --> 01:14:43,357
A man who came from literally nothing
to becoming the best behavioral analyst

847
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,815
I have ever worked with.

848
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:50,197
A childhood of poverty,
a life on the streets,

849
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:54,452
and... and the ability to find courage

850
01:14:54,532 --> 01:14:56,370
in the face of what happened to his father

851
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:59,795
was a testament to Lucas's
strong-willed mind.

852
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:05,210
A mind that... that baffled us all.

853
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:08,758
As we remember Lucas today,

854
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:13,218
let's hold him in our hearts

855
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:16,179
and remember him,
not just the colleague...

856
01:15:18,014 --> 01:15:21,769
and not just a hero, because he was.

857
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:25,275
Let's remember a friend.

858
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,076
God bless Lucas and Godspeed.

859
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:36,540
Yep, that's quite the send-off.

860
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:43,668
Come on!

861
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,377
Get him!

862
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:50,508
Get off him now.

863
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:52,807
- I'm Lucas.
- I'm Vasti.

864
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:08,531
You gonna put down my gun now?

865
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,900
Can I?

866
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,735
How do I know you're still with the plan?

867
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:15,616
It wasn't the easiest plan to follow,
but I stayed on point.

868
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,118
Really?

869
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:19,161
That was some convincing shit, brother.

870
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,706
Oh, you think so?
I thought maybe I went over the top.

871
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:23,624
Are you kidding me? You had me
thinking you were one of them.

872
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:25,543
Well, what about that accent?
Where'd you pick that up?

873
01:16:25,623 --> 01:16:26,875
I had five years to work on it.

874
01:16:26,957 --> 01:16:28,004
And Why'd you come on
so hard in the fight?

875
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:31,007
- Dude, you shot at me.
- I shot near you.

876
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:33,385
- Okay, whatever.
- We gotta get going. You ready?

877
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,179
Yeah.

878
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:41,726
Here we go.

879
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:43,149
Giddyup.

880
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:11,506
That's a lot of zeros.

881
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:19,636
- We good?
- Oh, we are so good.

882
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:21,929
Let's go.

883
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:30,317
- I hate tight spaces.
- You got this.

884
01:17:35,776 --> 01:17:39,366
Okay, this is the only
part of the plan I was not crazy about.

885
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:41,035
- You okay?
- Yeah, I got this.

886
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:42,536
How much time before
the water comes back on?

887
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:44,618
We got six minutes,
so we gotta book it. Let's go.

888
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:46,796
- All right, ladies first.
- Yeah, suck it up, buttercup.

889
01:17:50,291 --> 01:17:51,962
You okay back there?

890
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:55,592
Yeah, aside from the 2,000 pounds
of high explosives on my ass.

891
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:08,021
That means the water's coming.
We gotta haul ass!

892
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:15,199
Water's coming!

893
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:20,120
Go, go, go, go, go!

894
01:18:44,762 --> 01:18:46,309
All right, man, we should get going.

895
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:50,980
- One last stop.
- Yep.

896
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:21,925
Knight to queen four. Checkmate.

897
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:36,817
I heard you were dead.

898
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:40,151
Yeah. I heard that, too.

899
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,579
Come on.

900
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:51,412
Planes waiting.
Fake passports cost me a fortune.

901
01:19:51,495 --> 01:19:54,248
Uh, is there any rush?

902
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:01,050
Not anymore.

903
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:09,181
The terrorist responsible
and a hero perished in the attack.

904
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:14,104
But today, we look forward knowing
that as a people we are unbowed.

905
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:19,065
In other news, an anonymous donor has
pledged $100 million for the establishment

906
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:20,945
of scholarships and other services

907
01:20:21,025 --> 01:20:23,744
for homeless children in and around
the Minneapolis area.

908
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,621
So what drives a person to commit a crime?

909
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:35,209
I guess I'm that individual who found
the smallest chink in the system's armor

910
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:37,712
and benefited from it.
