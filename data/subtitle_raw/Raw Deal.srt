1
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,890
- Green light.
- Let's go.

2
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,225
How many times was John Wayne nominated
for an Academy Award?

3
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,300
Probably not enough.

4
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,930
Marcellino's still asleep.

5
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,475
- I'm gonna go relieve Ed.
- How the hell can one son of a bitch
sleep so much?

6
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,055
- Fear.
- As long as he wakes up to testify.

7
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:51,265
Oh, no.

8
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:02,600
We've been looking for you.

9
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,390
- So you want to be a witness?
- No, no, no, no!

10
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,725
Witness this.

11
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,390
His birthday
was in two weeks.

12
00:04:20,474 --> 00:04:23,807
Harry, they wanna
take him out.

13
00:04:23,932 --> 00:04:25,890
Harry?

14
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:37,057
Twenty-seven years of this shit,
and I never got a scratch. Jesus Christ.

15
00:04:40,182 --> 00:04:42,057
I want a list of everybody
in Witness Protection...

16
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,057
who knew we
were holding Marcellino...

17
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:46,390
and anybody else
who could've known...

18
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:48,765
from the district attorney
to the commissioner.

19
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:52,057
They're dead, Mike.

20
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,099
Whoever set this up...

21
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,099
whatever it takes...

22
00:04:58,307 --> 00:05:00,849
they're dead.

23
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:03,349
Okay, Cullen. You're outta here.

24
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:29,224
<i>Now you're off and runnir
Runnirlike you're scared </i>

25
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:33,224
<i>Runnirunder radar
Runnirlike a deer </i>

26
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:36,974
<i>Somethirin the bushes

27
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:40,057
<i>Starirat your feelirs
Feelirlike you do </i>

28
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,724
<i>One-way rider
wanderirdown the road </i>

29
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:51,932
<i>Baby, I'm right beside you
everywhere you go </i>

30
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:58,390
<i>Once upon a daydream
Circumstances do </i>

31
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:01,557
<i>Everything to hold on
Everything for you </i>

32
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:05,265
<i>First we found a loser
Next we found a fool </i>

33
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,057
<i>Now we follow footsteps
taken up on you </i>

34
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:13,390
<i>One-way driver
One way down the road </i>

35
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:18,682
<i>- Baby, I'm right beside you
- [Worker] Hey, you goddamn son of a...</i>

36
00:06:18,765 --> 00:06:20,765
<i>Everywhere you go </i>

37
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:46,224
- Whoa!
- Damn!

38
00:08:07,932 --> 00:08:10,224
Aah!

39
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:14,224
<i>[Man Chuckles] Yes, sir. Well, a number
of the residents have complained...</i>

40
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:18,724
<i>though, about the trash around the Dumpster,
so I think you should do something about it.</i>

41
00:08:18,807 --> 00:08:23,390
Yes, sir. Heh! All right.
Have a good day then.

42
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:32,724
- You caught the bastard.
- In the act.

43
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,474
Bullshit. I was on my way
to a costume party.

44
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,557
He stopped somebody over at Route 74
for driving too fast.

45
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:42,390
- He was going to let them off for 50 bucks.
- They stopped me for directions.

46
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:44,474
Book him.

47
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:48,890
Impersonating an officer,
resisting arrest...

48
00:08:49,015 --> 00:08:53,474
fraud, reckless driving
and lying to the sheriff.

49
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:56,224
- I'll be at home if you need me.
- Okay, Sheriff.

50
00:09:00,849 --> 00:09:04,349
Come on, Deputy Dawg.

51
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:28,474
<i>- [Sheriff] Amy.! Amy.!</i>

52
00:09:35,015 --> 00:09:37,224
Amy?

53
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:39,265
Amy?

54
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:45,890
- Are we having a party?
- Of course...

55
00:09:46,015 --> 00:09:50,140
and I'm glad you're home early
to join in the celebration.

56
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:53,057
Is it just gonna be us,
or are we gonna have company?

57
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:56,640
Be serious. Of course it's just us.

58
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,307
So, what are we celebrating?

59
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,182
Commemorating...

60
00:10:03,265 --> 00:10:06,724
our fifth year.

61
00:10:06,849 --> 00:10:11,307
Five years in exile.
Five years in a town without...

62
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:14,724
having found anybody who could talk
about anything except...

63
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:17,057
crops and the weather.

64
00:10:17,182 --> 00:10:20,015
- It's not gonna be forever.
- The hell it's not.

65
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:24,890
Christ, Amy, this is old news.
Let it go.

66
00:10:24,974 --> 00:10:28,140
- I did the best I could.
- The hell you did.

67
00:10:28,265 --> 00:10:30,849
You could still be with the bureau.
You could've fought it.

68
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:34,390
We could still be living in New York.
You did not have to quit!

69
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:37,099
They gave me a chance to resign.
If it would've gone to trial...

70
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:39,890
I would've lost
and they would've kicked me out.

71
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:43,265
I wouldn't have even had
the chance to get this job!

72
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:57,224
What are we having
for dinner?

73
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:59,307
Just this.

74
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,057
This is gonna make us fat.

75
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,224
You think because we're in shape
we're not already fat?

76
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:12,349
<i>We're like all the cows
they raise around here.</i>

77
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:16,390
Stuck.
Victims of circumstance.

78
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:21,349
And you know what a cow's
biggest contribution to this world is?

79
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:36,057
You should not drink
and bake.

80
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,974
Hello, Mark.

81
00:12:34,099 --> 00:12:37,640
- Yeah?
- It's Shannon, Mark. Harry Shannon.

82
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:42,724
It's been a long time, Harry.
What's going on?

83
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:46,224
I want to talk to you, Mark.
I got trouble.

84
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,890
- Talk.
- No. Not on the telephone.

85
00:12:50,015 --> 00:12:52,765
It's all I've got time for.

86
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,724
Things aren't so good,
huh, kid?

87
00:12:55,807 --> 00:12:58,015
Seen better days.

88
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:01,765
If you wanna see 'em again,
meet me.

89
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:40,099
The bureau always arranges
such intriguing meeting places.

90
00:13:41,474 --> 00:13:44,390
This has nothing to do with the bureau.

91
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:49,140
Mr. Patrovita,
you deny any sources of illicit income...

92
00:13:49,265 --> 00:13:51,557
any connection at all
with organized crime...

93
00:13:51,682 --> 00:13:56,974
yet your reported income
for this past year was $73,000...

94
00:13:57,099 --> 00:14:01,015
<i>with which you somehow
managed to maintain...</i>

95
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:04,099
a seven-bedroom mansion
here in Chicago...

96
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:06,515
<i>a hunting lodge in Wisconsin...</i>

97
00:14:06,599 --> 00:14:08,807
<i>a winter resort in California...</i>

98
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,849
four Cadillacs that we know of...

99
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:15,057
and a lifestyle that makes
Ted Turner look like a derelict.

100
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,765
Now, can you explain
how you manage this?

101
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,849
I think it'd be of particular interest
to those of us...

102
00:14:20,974 --> 00:14:23,349
<i>- on fixed incomes.
- [Mark] Hold it. That's Baxter.</i>

103
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:26,057
- I know, I know.
- What the hell has he got to do with it?

104
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,807
- He's special federal prosecutor.
- That son of a bitch cost me a career.

105
00:14:29,932 --> 00:14:33,182
You brought in a suspect with
half the bones in his body broken.

106
00:14:33,265 --> 00:14:36,349
- Any prosecutor would've gone after you.
- Oh, you remember the case.

107
00:14:36,432 --> 00:14:39,057
The guy kidnapped
an 11 -year-old girl.

108
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,724
He molested, murdered
and mutilated her.

109
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:46,724
Well, the public wasrt too keen
on heavy-handed cops at that time.

110
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:49,724
Baxter was out
to nail me to the wall.

111
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:52,724
- I went to see him,
tried to tell him what happened...
- What did he say?

112
00:14:52,849 --> 00:14:56,849
Resign or be prosecuted.
Any way you want it.

113
00:14:56,974 --> 00:14:59,224
Yeah, well,
the good news is that...

114
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:03,390
he's giving Patrovita a lot more shit
than he ever gave you.

115
00:15:03,474 --> 00:15:06,057
<i>- I got a lotta debts.</i>

116
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,307
[Baxter] Uh-huh. To whom?

117
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:14,682
- Friends.
- Like Paulo Rocca and Bill Rusman?

118
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:22,224
I plead the Fifth Amendment.

119
00:15:22,307 --> 00:15:24,432
<i>- That's Lu Patrovita.</i>

120
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:28,057
He runs the strongest
of the Chicago families.

121
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,349
<i>- [Baxter] Mr. Rocca,
your stated source of income...</i>

122
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:41,015
is a travel agency, yet you,
like Mr. Patrovita...

123
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:45,557
seem to, uh, have a lifestyle
that far exceeds your income.

124
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,390
Would you mind shedding some light
for us on what seems to be...

125
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:50,890
some extraordinary
money management here?

126
00:15:50,974 --> 00:15:54,724
I'll take the Fifth on this,
on whatever you're gonna ask me next...

127
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:56,849
<i>and everything after that.</i>

128
00:15:56,974 --> 00:16:01,057
Honest men don't have to tolerate
this kind of harassment in this country.

129
00:16:01,182 --> 00:16:05,182
Thank you, Mr. Rocca,
for reminding us of our inalienable rights.

130
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,182
<i>Rocca is the undertaker.</i>

131
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:11,224
<i>Anybody bothers Patrovita,
this one buries 'em in the gravel pit.</i>

132
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:16,890
<i>So we did Who's Who In Chicago. You're the one
in the bureau. What do you want from me?</i>

133
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:24,682
Do, uh...
Do you remember my son?

134
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:30,140
Blair. Yeah. We went to
some ball games with him.

135
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:33,557
- Yeah, that's right.
- He joined the bureau, didn't he?

136
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:37,932
Yep.

137
00:16:38,057 --> 00:16:40,015
<i>How is he?</i>

138
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:46,640
Dead.

139
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:55,099
I want Patrovita.

140
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,432
- He killed Blair?
- Blair was covering a government aide...

141
00:17:00,557 --> 00:17:03,640
a witness who could've
put the bastard away forever.

142
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:06,682
No.

143
00:17:06,765 --> 00:17:08,890
No, he had
somebody do it.

144
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:14,724
There's nothing that a small-town sheriff
can do that you can't.

145
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:18,515
Oh, no, no. The bureau
has nothing to do with this.

146
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,432
No, I'm financing
this myself.

147
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:25,099
I have $45,000
in savings.

148
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:32,474
I want you to get inside the Patrovita
organization and tear it up.

149
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,224
Who do you think I look like?
Dirty Harry?

150
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:40,390
- I think you look like an unappy man.
- You have a cure?

151
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:42,682
Possible reinstatement.

152
00:17:42,765 --> 00:17:44,890
Get back into the bureau.

153
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:47,390
<i>- Hmm?
- How?</i>

154
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:51,765
The bureau's been trying to get somebody
inside of Patrovita's family for over a year...

155
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,057
but there's
a big leak somewhere.

156
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:57,307
All our guys
keep getting nailed.

157
00:17:57,432 --> 00:18:03,224
That's why no one but me
will know about you. Nobody.

158
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:09,140
Now, you do a good job, you pull this off,
and you've got a great shot.

159
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:11,640
<i>Now, what do you say?</i>

160
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:15,265
Do you think I'd
still pass the physical?

161
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:06,015
This is Kaminski, investigating a break-in
at the Petrolcam storage yard.

162
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:08,515
Roger, Sheriff. We copy.

163
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:30,557
I'm sorry you had to kill yourself off, kid...

164
00:20:30,682 --> 00:20:33,557
but it's safer
for everybody that way.

165
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,140
<i>The top slot
is Luigi Patrovita.</i>

166
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:40,765
<i>He's been up there for over 20 years.
He's smart.</i>

167
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,224
<i>Buried a marching band
getting where he is.</i>

168
00:20:45,474 --> 00:20:47,932
<i>His right arm is
a guy named Rocca.</i>

169
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:51,307
<i>He'd kill for table scraps.</i>

170
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:53,515
<i>Him you watch close.</i>

171
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:57,765
The false I.D. Corresponds
to a guy...

172
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:01,057
in the N.C.I. Computer
with a bad rap sheet.

173
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,724
The phone number
is a safe house...

174
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:07,057
where an answering machine
is set up to catch your bulletins.

175
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:11,724
There's $25,000 for initial expenses;
more if you need it.

176
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:15,890
The squat-face guy is a new kid on the block.
His name is "Hammer" Lamanski.

177
00:21:16,015 --> 00:21:20,474
He's been biting off
little pieces of Patrovita's pie.

178
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:23,849
<i>Doing damage to him
is probably your quickest way...</i>

179
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:26,599
<i>to catch the big mars eye.</i>

180
00:21:26,724 --> 00:21:29,932
<i>Remember, there's a leak.</i>

181
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:33,557
<i>He's the one
who got Blair killed.</i>

182
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:35,682
<i>He's the one I want.</i>

183
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:38,307
<i>Well, see ya in Chicago.</i>

184
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:45,224
Big player, number eight!

185
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:47,849
<i>Place your bets. Place your bets.
Place your bets.</i>

186
00:21:49,765 --> 00:21:52,515
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

187
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:59,182
All bets down.
All bets down.

188
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,724
Throw the dice!

189
00:22:05,432 --> 00:22:09,974
Seven! You lose.
Come and get another number.

190
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:12,224
Come and get
another number.

191
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:15,057
I don't think the table is straight.
I want to see Mr. Lamanski.

192
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,849
He's not around, pal. And all losers
don't think a table is straight.

193
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:21,307
I'm still right.

194
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:28,640
<i>[Overlapping] Oh, shit.! Yeah? So what?
Looks like the table's fixed.</i>

195
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:33,224
<i>This table's fixed.! You scumbag.! Hey, look
at that.! That's bullshit.! That's my money.!</i>

196
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:39,890
- Magic or magnet?
- Rudy! Rudy!

197
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:42,890
Hey, you! Get outta here!

198
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:45,182
Scram!
Who the fuck are you?

199
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:15,015
Hey! Wait up!

200
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:45,474
Guys, make sure to clean up the mess
before you knock off, okay?

201
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,307
I'm gonna kill
that bastard.

202
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:39,224
Excuse me. Could you move
to the side a little bit?

203
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:42,390
- Your lights.
- Thank you.

204
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:52,849
Oh, shit!

205
00:25:28,515 --> 00:25:31,015
It's costing us a lot of money
to get together like this...

206
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:35,682
because now my time
is won'th as much as yours.

207
00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:37,682
- Worth more.
- Hmm?

208
00:25:37,765 --> 00:25:41,182
- You got less of it.
- I gave you the courtesy of this talk...

209
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:43,890
because you worked
for me a long time.

210
00:25:44,015 --> 00:25:47,724
Like I said,
close down everything and get out...

211
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:50,140
or one morning you
are gonna wake up dead.

212
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:54,432
Luigi, I got employees, obligations...
There's plenty for both of us.

213
00:25:54,557 --> 00:25:58,849
There's no "both of us."
There's just me.

214
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:03,224
- You got two days.
- And then what? Back to work for you?

215
00:26:03,349 --> 00:26:07,724
You don't work around here
anymore for me...

216
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:10,057
or anybody.

217
00:26:13,265 --> 00:26:15,557
<i>Auggie, let's move one out.</i>

218
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:25,224
[Man] You got it.

219
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,724
Get down! Move it!

220
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:57,015
Fucking Lamanski! Who the hell
does that son of a bitch think he is?

221
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:59,182
<i>- He thinks he can take me outjust like that?
- Come on.!</i>

222
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:01,599
That bastard's crazy!

223
00:27:01,724 --> 00:27:04,890
He's a fucking amateur!
He learned nothing from me!

224
00:27:04,974 --> 00:27:07,557
- I'm still okay, right?
- Yeah.

225
00:27:07,682 --> 00:27:10,557
<i>Just a waste
of fucking bullets.</i>

226
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,057
Tony was a good kid.

227
00:27:13,182 --> 00:27:15,724
Make sure you get
a good replacement for him.

228
00:27:15,849 --> 00:27:18,307
You son of a bitch!

229
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,682
- Hey, you got the wrong car, pal.
- Shut up.

230
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:48,224
Hey, you know
who it belongs to?

231
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:52,557
Yeah, a guy who is probably gonna be dead
before it's out of warranty.

232
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:07,224
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you. Drive.

233
00:28:11,432 --> 00:28:14,724
<i>- What do you want?
- Take off all your jewelry.</i>

234
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:19,140
- Do you know who bought all this stuff?
- Martin Lamanski.

235
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:23,265
He has good taste in jewelry,
but you've a rotten taste in men.

236
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,349
Come on.

237
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,515
Gonna mess up your hair.

238
00:28:33,724 --> 00:28:36,057
Attagirl. Keep going.

239
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:02,640
Fuckir shit!
You took my lunch, you son of a bitch!

240
00:29:11,682 --> 00:29:13,640
Good evening, sir.

241
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:23,349
<i>- Down.</i>

242
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:27,682
- There is no down.
- Hey, I'm not a cop.

243
00:29:27,765 --> 00:29:29,765
I'm a player.

244
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:40,349
- A martini on me.
- Get you a drink?

245
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:42,557
- Oh, bartender.
- Yes, sir, a Manattan.

246
00:29:42,682 --> 00:29:44,640
Yeah, another one.

247
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:48,640
What do you need?

248
00:29:48,765 --> 00:29:51,682
Couple of minutes
with Mr. Rocca.

249
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:56,932
- Not possible.
- Tell him I'm the pain in Lamanski's ass.

250
00:29:57,057 --> 00:30:00,474
Wait here.

251
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:05,140
- You're working for Morgan and Company, right?
- Richard's supposed to meet us.

252
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:10,557
Ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets.

253
00:30:11,682 --> 00:30:13,640
Cards?

254
00:30:18,932 --> 00:30:22,515
- Losing improves your character.
- Winning improves your wardrobe.

255
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:25,515
<i>Again, place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

256
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,182
<i>- Cards?

257
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,557
<i>- Go on in.

258
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:08,349
What's your name?

259
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:10,849
Joseph P. Brenner...
Joey.

260
00:31:12,057 --> 00:31:15,307
And you're the pain
in Lamanski's ass, huh?

261
00:31:15,432 --> 00:31:19,307
Wasted one of his joints
and took down a couple of his bag men.

262
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:23,224
And this stuff
comes from his girlfriend.

263
00:31:25,099 --> 00:31:27,349
What'd you bother
with that for?

264
00:31:27,432 --> 00:31:30,849
Intimidation.
Let him know that nothing is safe.

265
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:34,057
What are you
trying to prove?

266
00:31:34,182 --> 00:31:37,890
Joey, this is Max Keller.

267
00:31:38,015 --> 00:31:41,640
Max takes care of things...
all kinds of things.

268
00:31:41,724 --> 00:31:45,890
- Trying to prove that maybe you can use me.
- For what?

269
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:49,890
To take care of things...
all kinds of things.

270
00:31:51,932 --> 00:31:54,140
That job's filled.

271
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:56,807
I'm sure a smart man like Mr. Rocca
is always looking to upgrade.

272
00:31:56,932 --> 00:32:00,057
<i>- I'm the best there is.
- Max...</i>

273
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,974
if you're the best there is,
the wheel would've never been invented.

274
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:11,015
- How'd you know I was looking for somebody?
- I didn't.

275
00:32:11,099 --> 00:32:13,307
I thought
I might get lucky.

276
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,390
Where're you from?

277
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,640
The last few years?
Miami.

278
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:24,724
- Your references?
- I'm in the computer.

279
00:32:24,849 --> 00:32:28,307
I'm sure you can find a couple of cops
that can punch it up for you.

280
00:32:28,432 --> 00:32:32,557
What makes you think I'd be happy
to see Lamanski's ass kicked?

281
00:32:32,682 --> 00:32:38,057
You see, in Miami, we can tell everything
by the flow of the blow.

282
00:32:38,182 --> 00:32:42,557
This Lamanski has been making
bigger buys every week.

283
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,140
Now, I know he has been
biting into someone's action.

284
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:52,724
Go see the cashier.

285
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:56,390
She'll give you a thousand dollars
in chips. Enjoy yourself.

286
00:32:56,515 --> 00:33:00,015
In case you forget,
I'll be checking back with you.

287
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:16,724
I don't believe
a fucking word he said.

288
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:22,515
Girl Scouts build character...

289
00:33:23,807 --> 00:33:26,599
and it's a lot cheaper.

290
00:33:26,724 --> 00:33:29,640
You pester me,
I'll have you tossed out.

291
00:33:29,724 --> 00:33:32,224
You have that kind
of clout around here?

292
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:35,390
- They know me.
- I envy them.

293
00:33:35,515 --> 00:33:40,099
<i>- Place your bets.
- I'm sure nobody will mind
if you go home before you're broke.</i>

294
00:33:40,224 --> 00:33:44,932
Don't trouble yourself over my money.
I always get more.

295
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:49,599
Getting it somewhere else
might change your luck.

296
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:24,682
Where the hell
do you think he's goir?

297
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:27,682
<i>Takira leak?</i>

298
00:34:32,557 --> 00:34:34,890
He's in here? Perfect!

299
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:40,515
If any more guys duck down that alley,
we're gonna start sellir tickets.

300
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:46,432
- Where'd he go?
- This way.

301
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,057
Come on, come on!
Come on!

302
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,974
Forget it!

303
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,974
- Hurry up!
- Wait up!

304
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:47,599
- Any trouble?
- Oh, nothing special.

305
00:35:47,724 --> 00:35:52,099
- All these alleys probably have rats.
- You got some I.D.?

306
00:35:52,224 --> 00:35:54,099
Sure.

307
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:58,807
Saw those three guys
leave the hotel after ya.

308
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,515
Anything particular
or, uh, just a mugging?

309
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:04,890
They had trouble telling me
what they wanted.

310
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,140
Yeah, I'll bet.

311
00:36:08,265 --> 00:36:11,682
Joseph P. Brenner.
What's the "P" stand for?

312
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:13,724
Pussy.

313
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,807
See ya around.

314
00:36:20,474 --> 00:36:23,390
<i>Harry, everything is
moving along fine.</i>

315
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:25,432
The apartment is okay.

316
00:36:26,474 --> 00:36:29,432
I'm renting a car tomorrow.

317
00:36:29,557 --> 00:36:32,724
Something happened last night
that got me thinking.

318
00:36:32,849 --> 00:36:35,682
I might get into a spot
where a cop is shooting at me.

319
00:36:35,765 --> 00:36:38,015
Any idea how
I ought to handle it?

320
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:41,182
Three back-busters jumped me.

321
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:45,140
I have a feeling that Max Keller
had something to do with it.

322
00:36:45,265 --> 00:36:50,974
Rocca is probably checking on me
as I talk. I'll stay in touch.

323
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:13,724
Hi.

324
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:17,724
When was the last time
you had a good piss?

325
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:38,724
Hey, let me in. I gotta take a leak.

326
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,432
<i>- [Woman] Freeze.!
- Don't move!</i>

327
00:37:43,765 --> 00:37:46,557
- Hold it right there!
- In the back room! Cover me!

328
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:52,015
- We got 'em now!
- Let's get out of here!

329
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:54,849
<i>- Freeze!

330
00:37:54,932 --> 00:37:57,140
- Hey, what the...
- Hold it!

331
00:38:00,432 --> 00:38:02,307
<i>- [Man] Throw it.!</i>

332
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:07,307
- You got a paper?
- I got a warrant. You got your rights.

333
00:38:07,432 --> 00:38:10,557
Patrovita's got
a big fuckir headache.

334
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,015
Call the president.
I think we just fixed the deficit.

335
00:38:22,807 --> 00:38:26,057
That's $100 million
on the street.

336
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,474
We can make it up
in a couple of weeks.

337
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,474
Just what
Lamanski needed.

338
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:42,932
If he's got a lot of shit on hand,
he's gonna step in at bargain prices...

339
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:45,849
and grab a great big chunk
of the business!

340
00:38:45,932 --> 00:38:48,765
Well, why don't we
just take him out?

341
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,849
Because he's
looking for it!

342
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:55,140
You won't get near him now,
unless you want to start a war.

343
00:38:56,182 --> 00:38:58,557
Nobody needs that.

344
00:39:00,307 --> 00:39:02,224
Later.

345
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:07,349
<i>- How many got busted?
- Eight.</i>

346
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:10,182
Nobody pulled a trigger.
They'll all make bail.

347
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:17,182
Have you found
a replacement for Tony?

348
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:19,224
I'm looking somebody over.

349
00:39:23,682 --> 00:39:26,974
- I want it back.
- What?

350
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:29,932
The money. The smack.
It's mine. I want it back.

351
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:32,932
Oh, come on! What are we gonna do,
knock over city hall?

352
00:39:33,057 --> 00:39:35,390
We don't even know
where they got it stashed.

353
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:38,724
But we know somebody
who can tell us.

354
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:43,057
That shit is mine.
I paid for it, and I want it back.

355
00:39:46,557 --> 00:39:48,724
And I'm gonna get it back.

356
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:55,390
How the hell is it
you never did any time?

357
00:39:55,515 --> 00:39:58,724
I'm smart,
unlike someone we know.

358
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:02,682
Max thinks you stink
from trouble.

359
00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:06,474
<i>- He doesn't want you around.
- I'm sure he makes a lot of mistakes.</i>

360
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:09,890
Never the same one twice.

361
00:40:10,015 --> 00:40:12,515
You're on.

362
00:40:14,349 --> 00:40:16,557
But consider yourself temporary.

363
00:40:24,057 --> 00:40:27,724
<i>And if Max is right,
very temporary.</i>

364
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,224
We start tomorrow.

365
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:39,390
It's nice to be
one of the family.

366
00:40:44,015 --> 00:40:46,557
- Get my car, please.
- Yes, sir.

367
00:40:49,182 --> 00:40:52,057
Sam, could you
get me a cab, please?

368
00:40:53,932 --> 00:40:55,890
<i>Taxi.!</i>

369
00:40:56,974 --> 00:40:59,099
How'd you do
the other night?

370
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:02,390
- Your money didn't change a thing.
- And tonight?

371
00:41:02,515 --> 00:41:04,807
I got out with cab fare.

372
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,182
Maybe you should try
a different kind of recreation.

373
00:41:10,515 --> 00:41:12,890
Losing at tennis
wouldn't make me feel any better.

374
00:41:13,015 --> 00:41:15,015
The exercise might.

375
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:28,724
- We don't need you.
- Thanks, pal.

376
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:30,765
Okay. Thank you.

377
00:41:31,932 --> 00:41:34,765
You're a real
take-charge guy.

378
00:41:37,724 --> 00:41:41,307
Hold your glass very still.

379
00:41:42,765 --> 00:41:44,849
Oh!

380
00:41:44,932 --> 00:41:47,515
Huh!

381
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,265
Oh. I don't know why they advertise
all those sleeping pills on television.

382
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,265
I mean, chemicals are
no good for you.

383
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:03,224
A couple of bottles of champagne
wipes you right out.

384
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:05,474
Exactly.

385
00:42:08,057 --> 00:42:12,640
What are you sayir?
Are you sayir you're ready for bed?

386
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:19,349
- I think so.
- That sounds like a hell of an idea to me.

387
00:42:21,807 --> 00:42:24,890
Gonna help you get up.
Ooh!

388
00:42:25,015 --> 00:42:27,349
Uuh! God!

389
00:42:27,432 --> 00:42:29,557
- Here.
- There you go.

390
00:42:29,682 --> 00:42:31,640
There you go.

391
00:42:32,765 --> 00:42:34,724
Come on. Hurry.

392
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:38,265
Oh, God!

393
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:42,974
- You know what I like about bedrooms?
- No. What?

394
00:42:43,057 --> 00:42:46,724
You almost always
find a bed in there.

395
00:42:49,307 --> 00:42:51,640
You know what?

396
00:42:51,765 --> 00:42:55,057
I've noticed
the same thing.

397
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:17,224
Oh, my God.

398
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:27,057
Great.

399
00:43:33,474 --> 00:43:35,432
Uuh!

400
00:43:40,015 --> 00:43:44,432
<i>- [Woman] I've got what there is.</i>

401
00:43:44,557 --> 00:43:49,390
<i>Joseph P. Brenner.
Social Security number, 567-3...</i>

402
00:43:50,724 --> 00:43:55,974
<i>567-34-5787</i>

403
00:43:57,474 --> 00:43:59,807
Dade County licence number...

404
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:04,849
48736892-R.

405
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,890
Passport number...

406
00:44:08,974 --> 00:44:14,224
H-1032642.

407
00:44:14,307 --> 00:44:17,390
Okay? He's asleep.

408
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:24,390
<i>He's passed out.</i>

409
00:44:24,515 --> 00:44:27,515
<i>This takes care of a thousand dollars
of my I.O.U., right?</i>

410
00:44:28,557 --> 00:44:30,515
<i>Okay.</i>

411
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,724
If there's something to say,
I'll call.

412
00:44:51,015 --> 00:44:53,890
<i>[Patrovita] We wanted to check
your water heater today, Sarah...</i>

413
00:44:54,015 --> 00:44:59,015
but the, uh, keys werert where they were
supposed to be, so we couldn't do anything.

414
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:04,015
If you tell us where the keys have been moved,
we'll come back and take care of it.

415
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,640
Look, come back to me
as quick as you can.

416
00:45:09,724 --> 00:45:13,890
Yeah, you don't want
to freeze to death in that water.

417
00:45:14,015 --> 00:45:16,724
- Fucking little worm.
- What's his problem?

418
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:19,682
We give him a million dollars
to tell us where to hit Marcellino.

419
00:45:19,765 --> 00:45:22,474
Now the son of a bitch
is pulling back.

420
00:45:22,557 --> 00:45:24,974
Well, maybe he doesn't know
where the shit is stored.

421
00:45:25,057 --> 00:45:30,890
How many places do you think the cops
can store that much cash and smack, huh?

422
00:45:31,015 --> 00:45:33,224
<i>Lfhe doesn't know it,
he'll find out.</i>

423
00:45:33,307 --> 00:45:36,724
Or maybe he just doesn't like
what you're planning.

424
00:45:36,807 --> 00:45:40,224
I'm supposed to give a shit
what he thinks?

425
00:45:40,307 --> 00:45:44,182
No, he'll come across.
What the hell's his choice?

426
00:45:44,265 --> 00:45:47,390
<i>- He's in up to his ass.
- There's no way I can talk you out of this?</i>

427
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:52,224
If you could, I shouldn't be where I am.

428
00:45:52,307 --> 00:45:55,557
When we start thinking
there's something we can't do...

429
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,724
something that's too big or too messy,
then we oughta get out.

430
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:03,349
This is like wrestling.
It's fixed.

431
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:07,015
And the cops are always gonna lose,
and they know it.

432
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,182
<i>I wanna hear you say
you're sorry </i>

433
00:46:23,265 --> 00:46:27,557
<i>- Nobody takes advantage of me </i>

434
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,599
<i>Uuh

435
00:46:29,724 --> 00:46:32,057
Over here, honey.

436
00:46:32,182 --> 00:46:34,474
Jeanine! Over here!

437
00:46:41,224 --> 00:46:43,224
<i>Iflooks could kill </i>

<i>Baby, don't you

441
00:46:53,515 --> 00:46:56,515
- Where's Metzger?
- I haven't seen him.

442
00:46:56,599 --> 00:46:59,224
- How's business?
- We're dying.

443
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:02,057

<i>You don't wanna see my anger </i>

446
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,557
<i>So don't you make
another mistake </i>

447
00:47:10,682 --> 00:47:12,640
That's him!

448
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:19,057
<i>- That's a harmless, empty threat </i>

449
00:47:20,724 --> 00:47:24,224
Hey! Watch it!

450
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:26,224
- Stop it!
- Asshole!

451
00:47:26,349 --> 00:47:29,432
<i>- Iflooks could kill

452
00:47:29,557 --> 00:47:31,890

00:47:36,224 --> 00:47:40,224
<i>- Oh, God!

455
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:42,724
Uh! No, no! No, please!

456
00:47:42,807 --> 00:47:44,765
<i>- Come here.!</i>

457
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:46,849
- Help me!
- Come here!

458
00:47:49,557 --> 00:47:51,932
I hear you're paying off everybody
but the fucking government.

459
00:47:52,057 --> 00:47:55,599
- Lamanski says pay him.
He'll come back with a torch.
- So you decided to pay us both.

460
00:47:55,724 --> 00:47:58,349
- Is that it?
I didn't know you had so much loose cash.
- Just stay out of it.

461
00:47:58,432 --> 00:48:02,390
- No. I'm gonna close down.
- Oh, yeah? You try it, all right?

462
00:48:02,474 --> 00:48:05,640
<i>- You piece of shit!</i>

463
00:48:07,765 --> 00:48:10,140
- Uh!
- Ah! Do something, huh?

464
00:48:16,557 --> 00:48:20,640
<i>- [Man] Oh, my God.!
- This is what you're gonna look like dead.</i>

465
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:22,849
<i>- Don't pay Lamanski anymore.

466
00:48:22,932 --> 00:48:25,724
If I torch this shit-house,
you'll be inside it.

467
00:48:27,432 --> 00:48:29,682
Get in my way again,
and I'll kill ya.

468
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:32,349
I hope you're not
your mother's only child.

469
00:48:32,432 --> 00:48:36,724
Ohh! Oh, Mr. Metzger,
are you all right?

470
00:48:36,807 --> 00:48:39,890
<i>Iflooks could </i>

471
00:48:40,015 --> 00:48:41,974
<i>Kill </i>

472
00:48:43,974 --> 00:48:48,515
- I didn't think you were this twisted.
- Twisted? This is kid stuff.

473
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:51,224
We got a call. Somebody thought
there was some trouble here.

474
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:53,890
Oh, the boys were having
some trouble with their makeup.

475
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:58,890
Joey P. Brenner. You turn up
in the most damnedest places.

476
00:48:58,974 --> 00:49:01,390
Trying to learn
my way around.

477
00:49:01,474 --> 00:49:05,349
Well, you got a good guide if you wanna
know your way around a sewer.

478
00:49:05,432 --> 00:49:07,974
<i>Iflooks could kill </i>

479
00:49:08,057 --> 00:49:12,599
- Where do you know that cop from?
- Oh, he broke up a fight I had in an alley...

480
00:49:12,724 --> 00:49:16,182
the night you sent your three assholes
to take me apart.

481
00:49:21,474 --> 00:49:23,599
<i>We don't know what his name is yet...</i>

482
00:49:23,724 --> 00:49:25,849
<i>but he's definitely
working for Patrovita.</i>

483
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:30,349
- I don't want his name. I want his ass.
- I'll see to it he disappears.

484
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,057
First you bust him up real good,
public and messy.

485
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:38,057
Everybody should know what you get
when you kick in my door.

486
00:49:43,182 --> 00:49:45,307
Shit, I hate this game.

487
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:48,890
This looks like
it's going to be fun.

488
00:49:49,015 --> 00:49:52,390
- That'd be different.
- Why? He's not a good host?

489
00:49:52,474 --> 00:49:55,390
Some of his friends
can be a pain in the neck.

490
00:49:55,474 --> 00:49:57,724
Hey, you're with
the main man.

491
00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:00,599
If you have any trouble, you let me know.

492
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:15,557
- Wear that one.
- Beautiful, beautiful. Give it some sparkle.

493
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,849
- Such a pretty dress.
- Oh, like this? [Giggling]

494
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:21,890
Joey.

495
00:50:22,015 --> 00:50:24,265
I was hoping
you could make it.

496
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:26,265
Monique.

497
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:28,724
- Quite a party.
- Party?

498
00:50:28,807 --> 00:50:31,599
This is just a simple gathering
of the immediate family.

499
00:50:31,724 --> 00:50:34,890
Luigi's parties
have to be held outdoors.

500
00:50:35,015 --> 00:50:37,057
He wants to meet you.

501
00:50:37,182 --> 00:50:39,140
Be right back.

502
00:50:44,515 --> 00:50:47,974
Hey, you guys having fun? I'm having a lot of fun.

503
00:50:48,057 --> 00:50:51,057
Let's capture the moment here,
huh? Come on.

504
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:55,682
Max, maybe you're
having too much fun.

505
00:50:55,765 --> 00:50:57,724
Eat something.

506
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:05,057
- I'll get you a nice eight by ten.
- Keep it. I'm not sentimental.

507
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,057
I didn't think so.

508
00:51:09,557 --> 00:51:11,557
Come in.

509
00:51:20,265 --> 00:51:24,724
- Joey Brenner, Luigi Patrovita.
- My pleasure.

510
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,640
You like getting close
to our friend?

511
00:51:30,724 --> 00:51:33,307
You want the job
done right, don't you?

512
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,599
- What have you found out?
- Nothing.

513
00:51:40,682 --> 00:51:42,807
I want you.

514
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,890
We tried that,
remember?

515
00:51:45,015 --> 00:51:48,474
You come home with me,
and you owe nobody nothing.

516
00:51:48,557 --> 00:51:51,057
I'll owe you,
won't I?

517
00:51:51,182 --> 00:51:55,390
Mr. Rocca thinks you would make
a won'thwhile addition...

518
00:51:55,515 --> 00:51:59,724
- to our various endeavors.
- I like to think so.

519
00:51:59,849 --> 00:52:03,057
<i>- Oh, you're a thinker.
- Sometimes.</i>

520
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,307
Not enough to get me
into any trouble.

521
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:10,057
From what we know,
you don't stay anyplace too long.

522
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,807
If you're not part of an organization
that can protect you...

523
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:18,890
- moving around is the next best thing.
- He's looking for a home.

524
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:24,307
You kill anybody, Joey?

525
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:26,390
Yeah.

526
00:52:29,474 --> 00:52:32,182
More than one?

527
00:52:32,265 --> 00:52:36,224
Three. You want names
and addresses?

528
00:52:45,724 --> 00:52:49,265
<i>- Smart, I like.</i>

529
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,849
Smart-ass, I don't.

530
00:52:55,015 --> 00:52:59,307
All right. Forget it. Go back to the party.
I want to talk to Mr. Rocca.

531
00:53:01,974 --> 00:53:03,932
Nice meeting you.

532
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,765
I don't know.

533
00:53:18,557 --> 00:53:21,515
You don't let him in
too far too fast.

534
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:24,515
Give him a little time
to impress us.

535
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:29,515
If he doesn't, we'll use him for
something dirty and dump him in the pit.

536
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,474
Cute, huh?

537
00:53:32,557 --> 00:53:34,557
What a doll.

538
00:53:45,474 --> 00:53:48,932
Yes, I think it would accessorize
the outfit beautifully.

539
00:53:50,682 --> 00:53:53,724
What do you think?
Does it make you drool?

540
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:57,807
I would have picked exactly
the same one. That is my taste.

541
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:00,807
Yeah? Do you like
this one better?

542
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:05,265
- What do you think?
Which one do you like better?
- Try it on.

543
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,724
- You don't mind sitting here?
- No. I like it.

544
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:10,974
- Okay. All right. I'll see you later.
- Bye.

545
00:54:11,057 --> 00:54:13,557
All right.

546
00:54:18,682 --> 00:54:22,724
- Well, this goes with the color. It's beautiful.
- Something in red?

547
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:25,640
<i>Well, I think it's something...

548
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,599
<i>It's just... red.</i>

549
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:34,224
Why don't you just pick one?
I'll never make up my mind.

550
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:37,849
- Why don't you take them both?
- I can't afford them both.

551
00:54:39,932 --> 00:54:41,890
I can.

552
00:54:42,015 --> 00:54:45,307
Oh. You do that
too easy.

553
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:48,182
You always buying things
for the ladies?

554
00:54:48,265 --> 00:54:52,807
- No. Not in a long time.
- Kiss her good-bye, shithead.

555
00:54:55,557 --> 00:54:58,057
It's a stickup.

556
00:54:58,182 --> 00:55:00,224
- Call security.
- Oh, really?

557
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:02,099
Just dial, dipshit!

558
00:55:32,057 --> 00:55:34,557
We're being robbed
and beaten!

559
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,057
Oh!

560
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,557
Out of my way, bitch!

561
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,432
I'm very hard to fit.

562
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:07,515
- This way!
- No, this way!

563
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,557
We're finished
shopping!

564
00:56:22,557 --> 00:56:25,515
Yeah? Well, come up with something!

565
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,682
If it was possible, Luigi,
and I'm not so sure it is...

566
00:56:29,807 --> 00:56:32,390
it's gonna take a lot of work
to pull this thing off.

567
00:56:32,515 --> 00:56:36,515
- A lot of planning.
- Look. We get a floor plan.

568
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,890
We buy ourselves
an inside man and we go.

569
00:56:39,974 --> 00:56:42,515
Our boy not only told me
where it is...

570
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,682
he told me they're moving it to a federal
depository for safekeeping next Tuesday.

571
00:56:47,765 --> 00:56:51,682
- Oh, Jesus. This is crazy!
- Look, last week in New York...

572
00:56:51,765 --> 00:56:54,849
$10 million won'th of cocaine
walked out of a police station.

573
00:56:54,932 --> 00:56:59,182
- Nobody knows where the hell it is!
It can be done.
- That was inside work.

574
00:56:59,265 --> 00:57:03,557
I'm talking
a major fucking job here!

575
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:07,390
It'll make Brinks
look like rolling a drunk.

576
00:57:07,515 --> 00:57:11,224
There's 50 cops in that building any hour of
the day. How you gonna get 'em outta there?

577
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:13,724
Give 'em tickets
to the ball game?

578
00:57:16,807 --> 00:57:18,724
A bomb.

579
00:57:24,057 --> 00:57:26,640
Just blow the place up, huh?

580
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:31,807
The genius.

581
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,974
What are you
talking about?

582
00:57:35,057 --> 00:57:39,390
Bomb threat. Whenever they get one,
they have to evacuate the whole building.

583
00:57:39,515 --> 00:57:43,224
<i>Yeah, sure.
If they believe it.</i>

584
00:57:43,307 --> 00:57:47,057
They get that shit all the time.
How you gonna guarantee they'd bite?

585
00:57:47,182 --> 00:57:49,140
Make them nervous.

586
00:57:49,224 --> 00:57:53,974
Make them believe someone is trying
to blow up every police station in the city.

587
00:58:11,724 --> 00:58:14,849
- Hey! Where you going?
- Filling the vending machine.

588
00:58:14,932 --> 00:58:17,807
- Where's Bobby?
- Ha! That's what the boss would like to know.

589
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:20,390
Hey, you guys bigger on
potato or corn chips?

590
00:58:20,474 --> 00:58:23,265
The guys in the 6th don't touch the corn.

591
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:27,390
- 9th District, Sergeant Mora.
- Myself, I don't care, you know.

592
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,890
<i>- [Mora] Okay, lady. Where are you?

593
00:58:31,974 --> 00:58:34,474
<i>Anybody hurt?</i>

594
00:58:34,557 --> 00:58:37,557
<i>All right. Someone will be out
over there in a little while.</i>

595
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:25,724
Well, it doesn't look like
they intended too much damage.

596
00:59:25,849 --> 00:59:28,807
There's always the chance
the guy was a bad bomb maker.

597
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:33,765
- What're you doir here, Harry?
- Oh, just hopir that some...

598
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,807
half-assed, pro-life,
whale-lovir terrorist didn't do it...

599
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:40,807
so the bureau doesn't have to get involved,
and we can leave it in your good hands.

600
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:44,015
- Hmm.
- It's crude. It's very crude.

601
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:46,099
How are ya, Harry?

602
00:59:48,057 --> 00:59:51,932
Hello, Marvin. Yeah, I'm gettir better.
How about yourself?

603
00:59:52,057 --> 00:59:56,224
- Well, complaining doesn't make
any difference, huh?
- [Man] Come get a shot of this.

604
00:59:56,307 --> 00:59:58,515
So, what do you figure
this was?

605
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:02,015
Well, he thinks somebody was mad
at the vending machine.

606
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,807
Uh, look, you two kibbutz
somewhere else.

607
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:07,599
- You're impeding criminal science.
- Yes, yes, right.

608
01:00:07,724 --> 01:00:10,432
So, how goes
your Patrovita case?

609
01:00:10,557 --> 01:00:12,432
I find new angles
every day.

610
01:00:12,557 --> 01:00:15,849
Believe me, he'll run out of options
before we run out of patience.

611
01:00:15,932 --> 01:00:18,599
- I already have.
- Nobody can blame you.

612
01:00:18,724 --> 01:00:20,599
Somebody said
they took you off this case.

613
01:00:20,724 --> 01:00:25,057
Well, they don't control
all the hours of my day.

614
01:00:25,182 --> 01:00:29,724
Don't mess around, Harry. We might have
something workir that you don't know about.

615
01:00:29,849 --> 01:00:34,474
My guess is that whatever
you've got workir... won't work.

616
01:00:34,557 --> 01:00:36,474
We're doir all we can.

617
01:00:36,557 --> 01:00:38,849
Great. So am I.

618
01:00:38,932 --> 01:00:44,349
I know with you it's personal, but we're
both after the same thing... justice.

619
01:00:45,265 --> 01:00:47,182
Right, Harry?
Justice.

620
01:00:47,265 --> 01:00:50,057
Fuck justice!

621
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:55,140
<i>- Allow me.</i>

622
01:00:55,224 --> 01:00:57,557
There you go.

623
01:00:57,682 --> 01:00:59,557
<i>I don't really
want to lose you </i>

624
01:00:59,682 --> 01:01:01,890
<i>But I don't want to go </i>

625
01:01:03,724 --> 01:01:07,140
What's new on
the domestic front?

626
01:01:07,224 --> 01:01:10,349
I don't have the report
typed out yet.

627
01:01:10,432 --> 01:01:14,140
<i>I can tell the way they act
and their attitude </i>

628
01:01:14,224 --> 01:01:18,099
Remember that horse we used to look at?
I bought it.

629
01:01:18,224 --> 01:01:20,515
What's on your mind, Max?

630
01:01:20,599 --> 01:01:22,515
You.

631
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:25,099
What can he do for you
I can't?

632
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:27,807
This was your idea,
not mine.

633
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:30,640
Well, I didn't expect it
to go this far.

634
01:01:30,724 --> 01:01:32,765
How far has it gone?

635
01:01:34,224 --> 01:01:36,849
Does he climb into your pants
five times a day?

636
01:01:36,932 --> 01:01:38,849
Is that what you wanna hear?

637
01:01:38,932 --> 01:01:42,099
Not really.
I'd like to know it was me.

638
01:01:42,224 --> 01:01:47,515
The only way you'll ever end up lying next
to me is if we're run down by the same car.

639
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:51,849
I like it when
you hurt me, baby.

640
01:01:51,932 --> 01:01:54,807
Myself...

641
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:57,515
I'd rather give
than receive.

642
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:00,057
Wrong.

643
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:03,432
<i>Ever think about
ever settling down </i>

644
01:02:03,557 --> 01:02:06,015
Max...

645
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:10,432
I don't think we're going to be
the kind of pals I hoped we'd be.

646
01:02:12,724 --> 01:02:14,599
<i>If a tear rolls from my eyes </i>

647
01:02:14,724 --> 01:02:16,724
<i>I feel the hurt inside </i>

648
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:19,265
<i>As I reach out to you </i>

649
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,849
I'm impressed.

650
01:02:21,974 --> 01:02:24,015
I'm hungry.

651
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:26,390
<i>I can't get out
You see, I'm tied </i>

652
01:02:26,474 --> 01:02:31,599
<i>- The more we know each other,
the less you wanna see me.</i>

653
01:02:31,724 --> 01:02:35,349
Is this an approach you developed yourself,
or something you read in a book?

654
01:02:35,432 --> 01:02:38,015
These guys from the dress shop
are going to be back...

655
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:40,599
and I don't want you around
when they do.

656
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:49,849
I like you.

657
01:02:52,057 --> 01:02:54,557
Maybe more than you like me.
I don't know.

658
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:00,182
Unless you're gonna tell me you're married
or something, I'm not staying away.

659
01:03:08,974 --> 01:03:10,890
You're married?

660
01:03:10,974 --> 01:03:13,724
For a long time.

661
01:03:23,057 --> 01:03:24,974
Where is she?

662
01:03:25,057 --> 01:03:27,307
Far away from here.

663
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,724
Well...

664
01:03:34,724 --> 01:03:36,640
that's a relief.

665
01:03:36,724 --> 01:03:38,640
I thought I lost it.

666
01:03:38,724 --> 01:03:41,724
All this great equipment,
and you're sitting on your hands.

667
01:03:41,849 --> 01:03:45,307
I was telling myself, "He's a slow starter,
but it gets hot when he gets going."

668
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:48,474
You're important to me.
You are a friend.

669
01:03:48,557 --> 01:03:50,724
<i>- You're more than a friend.
- "Friend."</i>

670
01:03:50,849 --> 01:03:54,515
<i>- You're more than that.
- We're friends.</i>

671
01:03:56,057 --> 01:03:58,557
When I wanna make friends,
I'll go to summer camp.

672
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:12,932
You wanna hear
something funny?

673
01:04:13,974 --> 01:04:16,349
I was sort of flattered.

674
01:04:16,432 --> 01:04:19,307
I thought you were going slow because
you thought this was real important...

675
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:21,390
and you didn't
wanna blow it.

676
01:04:30,265 --> 01:04:34,640
It's gonna take me a long time to figure out
which of us is the biggest asshole.

677
01:04:44,932 --> 01:04:48,682
<i>God.! They don't make 'em like that anymore.</i>

678
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:52,182
<i>Whoo.!</i>

679
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:02,390
The whole thing
could blow up.

680
01:05:02,515 --> 01:05:05,432
- Patrovita's gonna get Lamanski.
- Mmm.

681
01:05:05,557 --> 01:05:09,265
As long as they keep cutting down
the right people, I don't give a shit.

682
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:13,140
Patrovita wants the money and the dope
the cops got when they raided him.

683
01:05:13,224 --> 01:05:15,140
And he's gonna try
and get it.

684
01:05:15,224 --> 01:05:17,224
You're kidding.

685
01:05:21,099 --> 01:05:23,057
You know what happens
if we stop this?

686
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:27,265
Yeah. Since I'm the new boy,
they must figure that I'm the leak.

687
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:30,932
Let 'em have it.
This is not the reason we're in this.

688
01:05:31,057 --> 01:05:35,057
- What about Lamanski?
- Considering how we're involved in this...

689
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:37,057
I can't be of much
help to you, Mark.

690
01:05:37,182 --> 01:05:40,390
You're gonna have to
watch out for yourself.

691
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:43,765
You want out?

692
01:05:50,349 --> 01:05:52,349
I started to call Amy
last night.

693
01:05:52,474 --> 01:05:54,974
- I wanted her to know that I'm still alive.
- Dangerous.

694
01:05:55,057 --> 01:05:57,765
Yeah. But I've
put her through a lot.

695
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:01,807
But if we stop now,
the whole thing is for nothing.

696
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:04,265
And knowing Amy...

697
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:07,140
she probably
will kill me herself.

698
01:06:12,307 --> 01:06:14,265
Are you gonna stick?

699
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:20,349
This Joey has
a pretty good life.

700
01:06:20,474 --> 01:06:25,057
Expensive clothes,
a nice car...

701
01:06:25,182 --> 01:06:28,182
lots of money
and free time.

702
01:06:30,182 --> 01:06:32,474
I never had it so good.

703
01:06:34,515 --> 01:06:36,640
Just don't let it go
to your head, all right?

704
01:06:41,807 --> 01:06:43,724
That's kind of sudden.

705
01:06:43,807 --> 01:06:45,724
You don't work good
on short notice?

706
01:06:45,807 --> 01:06:48,265
Nothing works
if it isn't thought out.

707
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:50,515
They hit the 3rd District
in an hour.

708
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:53,224
We'll waste Lamanski
as a diversion.

709
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:55,307
It's my idea.

710
01:06:56,557 --> 01:06:59,182
What do you think?

711
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:01,349
I'll let you know
when it's over.

712
01:07:20,682 --> 01:07:22,640
We're ready.

713
01:07:34,765 --> 01:07:36,682
3rd District,
Sergeant Washington.

714
01:07:36,765 --> 01:07:42,057
You've got a bomb
inside the building.

715
01:07:42,182 --> 01:07:46,182
It goes off in 22 minutes.

716
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:50,390
All right.
Everything's jammed.

717
01:07:59,224 --> 01:08:01,349
We have a bomb.

718
01:08:01,474 --> 01:08:03,515
Call Bomb Disposal.

719
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:06,515
Clear the building.

720
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:10,390
<i> [People Singing
In Hebrew]</i>

721
01:08:14,432 --> 01:08:16,390
Bomb Disposal.

722
01:08:18,682 --> 01:08:23,265
Evacuate and barricade a perimeter
of 300 feet from the building.

723
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,307
We're on the way.

724
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:27,307
We're go.

725
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,432
So are we.

726
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:34,765
<i>- [Man] Clear those people.! Come on.!</i>

727
01:08:43,057 --> 01:08:45,015
<i>- [Man] Come on. Let's keep moving.

728
01:08:45,099 --> 01:08:47,515
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's go!

729
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:52,557
Let's go! Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

730
01:08:54,682 --> 01:08:58,807
Watch out! Watch where you're going!

731
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:03,015
- Come on! Come on!
- Let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

732
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:07,307
It's right down here.

733
01:09:09,557 --> 01:09:12,224
Torch!

734
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,390
<i>Come on.!</i>

735
01:09:24,724 --> 01:09:26,724
You see him?
Lamanski.

736
01:09:28,474 --> 01:09:31,224
<i>Take him when he's clear.</i>

737
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:37,390
<i>Shit.! No way.</i>

738
01:09:37,515 --> 01:09:39,390
Where the fuck did all
those people come from?

739
01:09:39,515 --> 01:09:41,390
Maybe they play bingo.

740
01:09:41,474 --> 01:09:45,224
Do you own a calendar, Max?
I bet it's a Jewish holiday.

741
01:09:45,307 --> 01:09:48,557
<i>Yeah, well, for his sake,
it better be the Day of Atonement.</i>

742
01:09:48,682 --> 01:09:50,724
We'll follow him
and take him when we can.

743
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:19,474
<i>All right. That's it.
He's ready. Outta here.</i>

744
01:10:19,557 --> 01:10:21,557
We're set.

745
01:10:26,599 --> 01:10:29,557
Oh, shit.

746
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,724
That's good.

747
01:10:33,807 --> 01:10:35,890
Guys, we're on the clock.

748
01:10:37,974 --> 01:10:41,307
- Come on.
- Here, fill this one.

749
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:01,349
<i>[Max] When we get to the expressway,
I'm gonna run him off the road.</i>

750
01:11:01,432 --> 01:11:03,682
Their car is much
heavier than ours.

751
01:11:03,765 --> 01:11:06,057
Wort matter
if you hit the driver.

752
01:12:38,974 --> 01:12:41,390
Run 'em into the wall.

753
01:13:44,265 --> 01:13:46,849
Let's get outta here!

754
01:13:54,307 --> 01:13:57,224
<i>- Wave your hands.!

755
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:08,140
- Let's go, let's go.
- This is it. Let's make it look good.

756
01:14:08,557 --> 01:14:10,724
Open the doors!

757
01:14:10,807 --> 01:14:12,724
- Clear!
- What happened in there?

758
01:14:12,807 --> 01:14:15,015
Stay clear!

759
01:14:36,974 --> 01:14:39,140
I don't know who in the hell
this guy is.

760
01:14:39,224 --> 01:14:42,849
- I've never seen him before.
- No mistake?

761
01:14:42,932 --> 01:14:48,015
Come on. Three years ago,
I busted Joey Brenner twice in two weeks.

762
01:14:49,057 --> 01:14:51,015
And that ain't him.

763
01:14:53,557 --> 01:14:55,557
You know where he is?

764
01:14:56,557 --> 01:14:58,640
Caribbean, I heard.

765
01:15:05,265 --> 01:15:07,640
When do you go back
to Miami?

766
01:15:07,724 --> 01:15:09,932
In an hour.

767
01:15:12,682 --> 01:15:16,390
I've got a charity softball game with
Dade County Sheriffs in the morning.

768
01:15:16,515 --> 01:15:19,390
Cops against cops.

769
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,932
You leave me no one
to root for.

770
01:15:24,974 --> 01:15:26,974
So what the fuck are you
doing for the money?

771
01:15:27,057 --> 01:15:30,765
- Sticking my ass out.
- Not far enough!

772
01:15:32,057 --> 01:15:35,349
Somebody got somebody inside.

773
01:15:35,432 --> 01:15:37,807
He's walking
all over the place.

774
01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:40,682
He's even been to my house.

775
01:15:40,765 --> 01:15:43,349
He could be banging my wife,
for Christ's sake!

776
01:15:43,432 --> 01:15:46,932
He didn't get by me.
I don't know how the hell he got there.

777
01:15:47,057 --> 01:15:49,474
What the hell's the difference?
We got him, right?

778
01:15:49,557 --> 01:15:52,390
Don't give me that "we" shit!
Max turned him up on his own.

779
01:15:52,515 --> 01:15:55,640
What do you want?
I can't tell you things I don't know about.

780
01:15:55,724 --> 01:15:58,474
Well, what do
you know about?

781
01:16:00,224 --> 01:16:02,349
You're telling me
about this bureau creep...

782
01:16:02,432 --> 01:16:05,182
who's trying to take me apart
in his spare time...

783
01:16:05,265 --> 01:16:09,140
because his kid got smacked
when we took Marcellino.

784
01:16:09,224 --> 01:16:11,890
So what's the good news?

785
01:16:12,015 --> 01:16:15,640
I had a friend at the bureau
check Harry Shannors case files.

786
01:16:15,724 --> 01:16:19,682
Whatever he's doing is unofficial.
There aren't any records.

787
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:26,349
If he were killed, there could be
no direct connection to you.

788
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:33,057
Oh. That's the good news, huh?

789
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:35,974
So who's gonna do it?
You?

790
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:40,890
Brenner.

791
01:16:44,432 --> 01:16:47,807
Yeah.

792
01:16:50,224 --> 01:16:52,099
I think I'd better
get going.

793
01:16:52,224 --> 01:16:54,807
Yeah? Where?
Canada? Mexico?

794
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:57,682
You're not getting out of my sight
until this is over and done.

795
01:16:57,765 --> 01:17:02,015
If you did some serious damage
to my organization...

796
01:17:02,099 --> 01:17:04,890
I wanna know where
I can lay my hands on you.

797
01:17:26,474 --> 01:17:28,390
I'll be right back.

798
01:17:28,474 --> 01:17:31,890
- Hey! We can't be late!
- Just a minute!

799
01:17:34,307 --> 01:17:36,224
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

800
01:17:36,307 --> 01:17:38,599
Sorry for the other night.

801
01:17:38,724 --> 01:17:42,682
<i>- Where would I learn how to deal with a friend?
- It's okay.</i>

802
01:17:42,807 --> 01:17:45,307
<i>Let's go.!</i>

803
01:17:45,390 --> 01:17:47,557
I was thinking
maybe we could talk.

804
01:17:47,682 --> 01:17:50,099
I have
something to do.

805
01:17:50,224 --> 01:17:53,057
<i>- Maybe later?
- Sure.</i>

806
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:55,390
<i>- Take my car and go home.</i>

807
01:17:55,474 --> 01:17:59,432
I'll call you as soon
as I get back. Okay?

808
01:18:10,724 --> 01:18:12,724
Watch yourself.

809
01:18:13,807 --> 01:18:16,724
Don't worry.

810
01:19:21,307 --> 01:19:24,932
<i>- You gonna tell me who it is?
- A cop.</i>

811
01:19:25,057 --> 01:19:27,224
Just a fucking cop.

812
01:19:28,557 --> 01:19:30,599
Go straight at him.

813
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:32,849
I'll take the far side.

814
01:19:53,432 --> 01:19:57,015
<i>Wherefore my heart is glad
and my spirit rejoices...</i>

815
01:19:57,140 --> 01:20:00,849
<i>my flesh also shall
rest in hope.</i>

816
01:20:00,974 --> 01:20:03,390
<i>Thou shalt show me
the path oflife.</i>

817
01:20:03,515 --> 01:20:06,307
<i>In thy presence
is the fullness ofjoy, ;</i>

818
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:10,974
<i>and at thy right hand
there is pleasure for evermore.</i>

819
01:20:11,057 --> 01:20:13,890
<i>In sure and certain hope
of the resurrection and eternal life...</i>

820
01:20:14,015 --> 01:20:16,682
through our Lord
Jesus Christ...

821
01:20:16,765 --> 01:20:21,015
<i>we commend to Almighty God
our brother, William Dunne...</i>

822
01:20:21,099 --> 01:20:23,390
<i>and we commit his body
to the ground, ;</i>

823
01:20:23,515 --> 01:20:28,390
earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

824
01:20:28,474 --> 01:20:30,724
<i>The Lord bless him,
keep him.</i>

825
01:20:30,807 --> 01:20:33,349
The Lord make his face
to shine upon him...

826
01:20:33,432 --> 01:20:35,890
<i>and be gracious upon him.</i>

827
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:39,974
- Harry!
- Waste him!

828
01:21:03,599 --> 01:21:06,057
Harry, I didn't know it was you.

829
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:08,557
That's all right.

830
01:21:08,682 --> 01:21:12,140
- Go on and get out of here.
- I'm gonna get the ambulance for you.

831
01:21:12,224 --> 01:21:14,557
It'll come.
Now you go on, beat it.

832
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,932
If the cops take you
and I don't make it...

833
01:21:17,057 --> 01:21:19,140
you'll be years
explaining this.

834
01:21:19,224 --> 01:21:21,140
Harry, don't die.

835
01:21:21,224 --> 01:21:23,557
<i>- It's not over.
- Then go on.</i>

836
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:25,724
Go on, get out of here.
Beat it.

837
01:21:25,849 --> 01:21:28,724
- I'll see you soon, okay? I'll see you.
- Go on!

838
01:21:57,349 --> 01:22:00,224
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Saving your ass.

839
01:22:24,182 --> 01:22:27,182
Okay. Pack whatever
you can't live without.

840
01:22:27,307 --> 01:22:29,640
Go to the Rock Falls Airport
and charter a plane.

841
01:22:29,724 --> 01:22:31,974
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

842
01:22:32,057 --> 01:22:35,265
To do what an old friend
asked me to do...

843
01:22:35,390 --> 01:22:37,349
knock 'em dead.

844
01:22:48,015 --> 01:22:50,474
<i>Did I mention the pit?</i>

845
01:22:50,557 --> 01:22:54,140
<i>Yeah, that's the gravel pit.
It's owned by Patrovita.</i>

846
01:22:54,224 --> 01:22:56,515
<i>You get an invitation,
don't go.</i>

847
01:22:56,599 --> 01:23:00,099
<i>Bustirrocks is only some
of what goes on out there.</i>

848
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,682
We got company.

849
01:25:51,807 --> 01:25:54,265
Which way?
I don't see nothir.

850
01:25:56,432 --> 01:25:59,057
<i>I can't get no </i>

851
01:25:59,182 --> 01:26:02,390
<i>Satisfaction </i>

852
01:26:03,515 --> 01:26:06,682
I can't get no

853
01:26:06,765 --> 01:26:09,182
Satisfaction

854
01:26:09,265 --> 01:26:12,390
'Cause I try, and I try

855
01:26:12,515 --> 01:26:16,890
And I try, and I try

856
01:26:17,015 --> 01:26:19,307
I can't get no

857
01:26:19,390 --> 01:26:22,849
I can't get no

858
01:26:22,974 --> 01:26:25,640
<i>When I'm drivirin my car </i>

859
01:26:25,724 --> 01:26:29,849
And a man
comes on the radio

860
01:26:29,974 --> 01:26:33,890
<i>He's telling me
more and more </i>

861
01:26:33,974 --> 01:26:37,890
<i>- About some useless information
- Billy, outside! Let's go!</i>

862
01:26:37,974 --> 01:26:40,890
<i>Supposed to fire
my imagination </i>

863
01:26:41,015 --> 01:26:44,015
<i>I can't get no </i>

864
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:47,015
No, no, no

865
01:26:47,099 --> 01:26:49,515
<i>Hey, hey, hey </i>

866
01:26:49,599 --> 01:26:52,057
<i>That's what I say </i>

867
01:26:55,932 --> 01:26:59,224
I can't get no

868
01:26:59,307 --> 01:27:02,474
Satisfaction

869
01:27:02,557 --> 01:27:06,140
<i>I can't get no </i>

870
01:27:06,224 --> 01:27:08,599
Satisfaction

871
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:12,057
'Cause I try, and I try

872
01:27:12,182 --> 01:27:15,849
And I try, and I try

873
01:27:15,932 --> 01:27:18,682
I can't get no

874
01:27:18,765 --> 01:27:20,724
I can't get no

875
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:25,682
When I'm watchir my TV

876
01:27:25,765 --> 01:27:29,640
And a man
comes on and tells me

877
01:27:29,724 --> 01:27:32,849
<i>How white my shirts
can be </i>

878
01:27:32,974 --> 01:27:35,140
But he can't be a man

879
01:27:35,224 --> 01:27:38,474
'Cause he doesn't smoke
the same...

880
01:29:49,474 --> 01:29:51,890
What exactly happened here
is unclear.

881
01:29:51,932 --> 01:29:55,932
Police speculate, based on the amount
of heroin and money found on the scene...

882
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:58,390
this may be the result
of a brewing mob war.

883
01:29:58,515 --> 01:30:00,474
Mob war my ass!

884
01:30:01,515 --> 01:30:03,890
Brenner!

885
01:30:03,974 --> 01:30:07,057
We don't know where
the son of a bitch is.

886
01:30:07,182 --> 01:30:09,057
Let's hope
he's not alive.

887
01:30:09,182 --> 01:30:12,557
From the looks of that mess,
I'd say he was dead.

888
01:30:12,682 --> 01:30:14,557
I think he's right.

889
01:30:14,682 --> 01:30:16,765
Don't think, pray!

890
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:19,390
If he's still alive,
you're not!

891
01:30:20,432 --> 01:30:24,015
Oh, shit!

892
01:30:27,432 --> 01:30:31,640
- Let's get him before he gets us! The elevators!
- Give me an extra clip.

893
01:30:31,724 --> 01:30:34,474
You! Stick around.

894
01:30:50,557 --> 01:30:52,515
Hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold it!

895
01:30:54,765 --> 01:30:56,849
Eh?

896
01:31:12,265 --> 01:31:14,015
<i>What?</i>

897
01:31:14,099 --> 01:31:16,890
<i>- Move!</i>

898
01:31:21,057 --> 01:31:23,182
Get down!

899
01:32:10,349 --> 01:32:12,682
Shit!

900
01:32:17,307 --> 01:32:18,849
He got me!

901
01:32:35,390 --> 01:32:37,682
Oh, shit!

902
01:32:44,807 --> 01:32:46,765
<i>- Come on.!

903
01:32:48,474 --> 01:32:50,599
<i>Come on.!

904
01:33:10,224 --> 01:33:12,182
Fuck!

905
01:33:26,765 --> 01:33:28,390
Damn it!

906
01:33:35,265 --> 01:33:37,557
Oh, damn it!

907
01:33:42,849 --> 01:33:45,349
- Come on!
- Get the son of a bitch!

908
01:33:50,932 --> 01:33:53,807
<i>Come on, man.!
Just you and me.!</i>

909
01:33:53,890 --> 01:33:56,890
<i>Come on.!
Show yourself!</i>

910
01:34:10,682 --> 01:34:12,557
- Now what?
- Call the cops.

911
01:34:12,682 --> 01:34:14,849
<i>- What?
- Call the fucking cops!</i>

912
01:34:21,974 --> 01:34:25,390
For God's sakes, let it...

913
01:35:13,349 --> 01:35:15,224
Kaminski?

914
01:35:15,349 --> 01:35:19,224
This must be what they mean
by "poetic justice."

915
01:35:21,599 --> 01:35:24,474
This is... isn't what you think.
I'm with the government.

916
01:35:24,557 --> 01:35:27,432
I set every one
of these guys up, and...

917
01:35:27,557 --> 01:35:31,349
So, back with the bureau, huh?
I didn't know that.

918
01:35:31,432 --> 01:35:33,557
It's, uh...

919
01:35:33,682 --> 01:35:36,890
You know, that whole thing
was such a mistake. You and l...

920
01:35:37,015 --> 01:35:40,390
Because of you,
a lot of people are dead.

921
01:35:40,515 --> 01:35:42,682
And now it's your turn.

922
01:35:42,765 --> 01:35:46,307
No. No.

923
01:35:52,307 --> 01:35:56,015
Resign or be prosecuted.

924
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:58,140
Any way you want it.

925
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:25,140
Excuse me.
We're coming through.

926
01:36:25,182 --> 01:36:28,140
<i>- Pardon me.

927
01:36:29,432 --> 01:36:32,015
<i>- Shit!</i>

928
01:36:33,390 --> 01:36:35,307
<i>All right.
Careful. Careful. Watch it.</i>

929
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:38,390
- Okay, Lenny.
- They said you got room for one more, right?

930
01:36:38,515 --> 01:36:41,765
<i>- Watch your back.
- What do you think Baxter was doing here?</i>

931
01:36:41,890 --> 01:36:44,890
Until I know different,
I gotta assume our leak's just been plugged.

932
01:36:45,015 --> 01:36:47,807
- Pardon the pun.
- What the hell you think happened here?

933
01:36:50,515 --> 01:36:52,390
I think somebody
got very pissed off.

934
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,724
- Who?
- I got a good idea.

935
01:36:55,849 --> 01:36:58,932
Baker, just got a location on the car.

936
01:36:59,057 --> 01:37:04,349
- Give it to me.
- A 1979 Oldsmobile
registered to Luigi Patrovita...

937
01:37:04,432 --> 01:37:06,349
moving south on Route 84.

938
01:37:06,432 --> 01:37:08,349
- Should they intercept?
- No. Negative.

939
01:37:08,432 --> 01:37:11,515
- Tell them to track him.
Keep me up on where he is.
- Ten-four.

940
01:37:13,724 --> 01:37:16,057
Where are you going?

941
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:18,682
I'm gonna see
how smart I am.

942
01:37:44,932 --> 01:37:47,099
Get on the plane.

943
01:37:47,224 --> 01:37:49,182
You okay?

944
01:37:57,224 --> 01:38:00,349
- You're not going, are you?
- No.

945
01:38:00,432 --> 01:38:02,349
Then I'm not either.

946
01:38:02,432 --> 01:38:04,765
You're out of excuses,
sweetheart.

947
01:38:04,890 --> 01:38:07,224
There's a quarter million dollars
in that bag.

948
01:38:07,349 --> 01:38:10,224
Win or lose,
it's your choice.

949
01:38:10,307 --> 01:38:12,474
Now get out of here.

950
01:38:16,057 --> 01:38:18,057
You'll be okay,
won't you?

951
01:38:29,224 --> 01:38:31,890
Get going.

952
01:39:28,724 --> 01:39:30,682
I'm glad you didn't
make me chase you.

953
01:39:30,765 --> 01:39:33,515
Too damn tired.

954
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:37,682
That doesn't surprise me. A hundred years
of police work in a single afternoon.

955
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:41,474
<i>Always figured
you were one of us.</i>

956
01:39:45,224 --> 01:39:47,682
How many days in a row...

957
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:52,349
do I have to haul
your butt down here?

958
01:39:52,432 --> 01:39:54,349
Hmm?

959
01:39:54,432 --> 01:39:57,099
Just to watch you
do nothing.

960
01:39:57,224 --> 01:39:59,349
I have no interest...

961
01:39:59,474 --> 01:40:03,057
in becoming
an accomplished cripple.

962
01:40:03,182 --> 01:40:07,140
Now you push me back to my room
or out into traffic. I don't give a shit.

963
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:10,349
Things not so good, Harry?

964
01:40:15,057 --> 01:40:17,974
- I've seen better days.
- Wanna see 'em again?

965
01:40:18,057 --> 01:40:20,515
Wort happen from down here.

966
01:40:23,557 --> 01:40:27,140
So, you used to being back
with the bureau?

967
01:40:27,224 --> 01:40:29,349
Sure.

968
01:40:29,432 --> 01:40:31,349
And back with my wife.

969
01:40:31,432 --> 01:40:33,390
Thank you very much.

970
01:40:36,807 --> 01:40:38,974
Come on, Mark!
Stop fooling around!

971
01:40:39,057 --> 01:40:41,057
Give me...
Give me my chair.

972
01:40:43,724 --> 01:40:45,640
I need your help, Harry.

973
01:40:45,724 --> 01:40:47,849
For what?
Where's my chair?

974
01:40:47,932 --> 01:40:50,974
My reunion with Amy
was a big success.

975
01:40:53,015 --> 01:40:55,015
We just found out
that she's pregnant.

976
01:40:55,099 --> 01:40:57,015
That's great.
That's great.

977
01:40:57,099 --> 01:40:58,932
Give me my chair.

978
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:01,800
I don't know anything
about being a father, Harry.

979
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:04,390
I want your help.
I want you to be the godfather.

980
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:07,015
All right. I'll help.
Now give me the goddamn chair!

981
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:09,970
- Then walk.
- I can't walk!

982
01:41:10,060 --> 01:41:13,180
Then meet me halfway.
Come on.

983
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,970
I don't have to walk
to be a godfather!

984
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:19,390
You don't have to walk,
but you have to try like hell.

985
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:27,890
- I can't!
- Did you ever quit in front of Blair?
