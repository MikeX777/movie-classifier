1
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:33,868
Hey! Wait!

2
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,369
Wait for me!

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:49,049
Who are these guys?

4
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:33,193
Come on, come on, come on!

5
00:01:58,218 --> 00:01:59,687
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

6
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:00,622
Don't overdo it.

7
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,725
Handbill says alive.

8
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:20,975
Morning, Zeke.

9
00:02:21,009 --> 00:02:25,580
That's Mr. Tyler to any
bastard who pistol whips me.

10
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:28,049
Somebody
woke up feeling prickly.

11
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,718
Oh, I was just dreaming
about a beautiful girl

12
00:02:30,752 --> 00:02:32,587
I know down at Saltillo.

13
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,423
Imagine my disappointment
to wake up and see you.

14
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:40,628
Anyone ever tell you you got
a face like a burned boot?

15
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:44,431
Now that other horse is gone,

16
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,101
there's no sign of
the third rider.

17
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,571
Well, I don't
suppose you unfortunate boys

18
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:53,007
have any clue who it is
you're robbing, do you?

19
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,209
We ain't bandits.

20
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:59,781
Clear as day, but I
don't see no badges.

21
00:02:59,814 --> 00:03:01,015
'Cause we ain't lawmen.

22
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:03,851
Bounty hunters then.

23
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:05,586
And from the looks of it,

24
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,320
some of the worst
I've ever seen.

25
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,890
That's mighty bold
coming from a man

26
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:11,425
on the ground
looking up, friend.

27
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,795
He prefers Mr. Tyler.

28
00:03:13,828 --> 00:03:16,329
Oh, I'll be sure to
have them carve that

29
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,800
in the tree they're probably
gonna hang you from.

30
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,802
Neither one of you know, huh?

31
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:22,302
I am astonished.

32
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,973
Some bounty hunters,
you two can't tell

33
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,341
the difference between
a skunk and a house cat.

34
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,610
Dutch, I got the feeling

35
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:31,145
he thinks we're
missing something.

36
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:32,714
Yeah, I'm picking up on that.

37
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:36,150
Hey, why don't you quit beating
the devil around the stump

38
00:03:36,184 --> 00:03:38,285
and just fill us in
on your little secret?

39
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:40,320
Information isn't free.

40
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,288
Neither are you.

41
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,391
So we understand each other.

42
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,226
We do.

43
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,795
And you're a man of your word?

44
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:48,763
I am.

45
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:49,964
You won't go back on it, now?

46
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:50,531
Never do.

47
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:52,767
Alright, here it is.

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,769
I see the both of you
just standing there

49
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:58,940
grinning at me when not
30 paces to your backside,

50
00:03:58,973 --> 00:04:00,141
there's the real prize.

51
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,021
Well?

52
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:19,527
Well what?

53
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,529
You shot a hole clean
through his face.

54
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,699
I can't make him out at all.

55
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,534
You couldn't have aimed lower?

56
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,035
Oh, well excuse me.

57
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:30,037
It didn't seem
important at the time

58
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:31,572
when he was trying to kill me.

59
00:04:34,075 --> 00:04:34,909
Who is that?

60
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,880
Gentlemen, allow
me to introduce you

61
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:43,851
to the dearly departed
Benicio Morales.

62
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:47,387
That's Moonshine Morales?

63
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,924
Lizard's Tooth himself.

64
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,491
What'd he say?

65
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:54,061
He says that's Benicio Morales.

66
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:55,530
This is Benny the Stallion?

67
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,398
How do we know you're not lying?

68
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,168
You know the stories?

69
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:02,402
Anyone wearing a six
gun knows about Morales.

70
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,404
Then you probably heard the one

71
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,240
about the Quechan natives

72
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:08,943
who inked a little scorpion
just above his heart?

73
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,378
Providing you didn't
blow a hole in it.

74
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:15,216
Hey, take a look at his chest.

75
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,157
He got a scorpion alright.

76
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,394
If this here's Morales,
who's that other guy?

77
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:28,229
Useless.

78
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,299
Well, I be damned.

79
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,434
I outgunned the Rio
Rattlesnake himself.

80
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,837
Did you hear that, Waco?

81
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,274
We were all riding
pretty quick there.

82
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:42,643
You coulda hit him by accident.

83
00:05:42,677 --> 00:05:43,911
Oh, you horse's ass.

84
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:45,378
That was marksmanship
and you know it.

85
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:47,982
And they'll sings of your glory

86
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,751
all throughout the heartland.

87
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:55,756
Now, if you two
would just untie me,

88
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,626
I'll take one of them
horses and skedaddle.

89
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,095
Now, why on God's green
earth would we do that?

90
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,798
Because you said you would.

91
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:06,801
Waco, did you ever hear
me make a deal like that?

92
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:07,835
Nope.

93
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:09,637
But you said you was
a man of your word.

94
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,806
I am, but it's not my fault

95
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,808
if you infer
something incorrectly.

96
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:17,178
You've got
to be kidding me.

97
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,946
That body over there
has gotta be worth

98
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,815
five times what I
am alive or dead

99
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,449
in any county west
of the Mississippi.

100
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,117
That's true.

101
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,684
It is.

102
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,987
And you are in hostile
border country.

103
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,654
We are.

104
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,322
-Yes we are.
-So?

105
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:32,126
Any bounty hunter with a lick
of sense north of his ears

106
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,996
knows that the move here
is to take that body

107
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,598
and hightail it to the
nearest town sheriff.

108
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:39,499
I'm only gonna slow you down.

109
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:42,003
Your chances of being
robbed and killed out here

110
00:06:42,036 --> 00:06:44,471
and me escaping is
not worth the price

111
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,841
on my meager little handbill.

112
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:47,842
Yeah.

113
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,810
You know, that, that
does sound smart.

114
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:52,546
So you'll let me go?

115
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:54,649
Nope.

116
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:55,549
Not a chance.

117
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,392
Ha. I figured it out.

118
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,862
Oh, we're in for it now.

119
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,897
Well, I recognize the name

120
00:07:09,931 --> 00:07:12,499
but my head's a bit
scrambled from earlier.

121
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,435
You's the Waco Kid, ain't you?

122
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:20,508
Bare knuckle boxing champion?

123
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,543
Yeah, I am.

124
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,846
You are famous!

125
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:27,848
Oh!

126
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:29,850
My daddy took me to one
of your title fights

127
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,519
when I was just a boy.

128
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:33,087
Oh yeah? Which one?

129
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,357
The one you lost.

130
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,394
He don't have to talk when
we turn him in, does he?

131
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:44,065
Well isn't this just
a day for celebrities?

132
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:48,102
We got a dead one and another
whose career's just as dead.

133
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,372
Say, what exploits
was you known for

134
00:07:51,405 --> 00:07:53,574
when you were younger, Dutch?

135
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,877
Kind that daddies don't
bring their boys to see.

136
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,917
You know, he's right though.

137
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,386
We can't camp out
here in the wide open.

138
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,588
Not with a body this valuable.

139
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,757
What was that town we
passed a while back?

140
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,994
Oro, Oro Lindo, Beautiful Gold.

141
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,263
We keep riding, we can
be there by nightfall.

142
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:17,932
What do you think?

143
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,667
Boom town with a name like that?

144
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:21,969
Sounds like a blast.

145
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,786
Somebody forgot to put
the boom in boom town.

146
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,287
More like doom town.

147
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:43,791
Looks like the sheriff's
office up ahead.

148
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,205
Evening gentlemen.

149
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,174
What can I do for you?

150
00:09:02,877 --> 00:09:03,944
You the sheriff?

151
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:12,086
Afraid not. Deputy Elijah Stone.

152
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,355
Well, Deputy Stone,
would you be so kind

153
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,857
as to round up the sheriff?

154
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,527
We've got some turkeys to trade.

155
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,998
Zeke Tyler. You back so soon?

156
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:27,835
Well, what can I say?

157
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:30,505
It's hard to keep an
angel outta paradise.

158
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:32,706
How's your sister, Eli?

159
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:36,911
She can still drink your
sorry carcass under the table.

160
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,181
Well you tell her I'm sorry.

161
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:43,217
The doctor promised it would
clear up in a few weeks.

162
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,786
Well, I can see you
two are acquainted.

163
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,121
Yeah, old Zeke here,

164
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:50,424
he's been staying in town
the last season or so.

165
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,694
Well it looks like
he ventured out

166
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:56,964
and got himself into
some trouble again.

167
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,165
He's been a wanted man

168
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:00,401
a whole lot longer
than a season.

169
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:04,038
Mister, we don't have
bounty hunters around here.

170
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,408
Some folks just like
to be left alone.

171
00:10:08,543 --> 00:10:09,910
Yeah, well you do tonight.

172
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:15,883
Charges are listed.

173
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:23,090
Whoa, hold on, one of
these is handwritten.

174
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:24,593
We couldn't find a law office

175
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,360
between hell and this town,

176
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:30,197
but I think you'll
recognize the name.

177
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,275
Trying to tell me
that that stiff there

178
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:45,179
is really Benicio Morales?

179
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:48,449
Pale Rider himself.
Tattoo and all.

180
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:55,456
Old Bullwhip Ben. I'm impressed.

181
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:02,730
Still in all, you're all gonna
have to wait 'til tomorrow.

182
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:07,602
Sheriff don't pay out except
from sun up to sun down.

183
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,805
Don't suppose he'd
make an exception here?

184
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,842
This one's been baking
in the sun all day

185
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:19,413
and this one's been running
our patience down so far,

186
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,115
he's in debt for it.

187
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:24,285
Well, you're just gonna have to

188
00:11:24,318 --> 00:11:27,154
endure their company
until tomorrow.

189
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:32,860
But you don't have to worry
about losing your catch.

190
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:36,631
This here's a nice,
safe, sleepy little town.

191
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:43,270
If it's so safe, what was that?

192
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:46,040
Bullfrogs.

193
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,742
Uh-huh?

194
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,512
Now I don't suppose
you could recommend

195
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:52,780
a place for us to
sleep for the evening

196
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:56,350
that ain't got no bullfrogs?

197
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,085
Everything this
side of the border's

198
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,521
closed up for the night.

199
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:05,125
But, on the south side of
town, cantina's still open.

200
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:09,029
You boys should
head on down there,

201
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:13,535
soak up some of the local
flavor until morning.

202
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:32,453
Go, got it, got it, yeah!

203
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:46,668
Two whiskeys, please.

204
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:56,443
Gracias.

205
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,346
Hey, you wouldn't have a place

206
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,148
we could stay for the
evening, would you?

207
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:02,684
I have a room upstairs.

208
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:04,218
That'll do great. Gracias.

209
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,442
Hello, darling.

210
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:32,846
What's a tiger lily like you

211
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,783
doing in a cow trough like this?

212
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,789
Oh, don't mind the ropes.

213
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:44,124
I was just practicing
my career as a escapist.

214
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,860
Wouldn't mind tying you up.

215
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,596
They say I'm a real artist.

216
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,267
Sorry ma'am.

217
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,769
If his brains were dynamite,

218
00:13:54,803 --> 00:13:56,805
he wouldn't have enough
to blow his nose.

219
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:00,407
Certainly seems
explosive either way.

220
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:05,814
Oh, now who's
feeling prickly, huh?

221
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:08,482
Can a condemned man have
a few simple pleasures?

222
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:09,917
Which whiskey's mine?

223
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,485
The one you pay for.

224
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,253
You're making a
bounty off of me.

225
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,756
And until we do,

226
00:14:14,789 --> 00:14:19,794
I'm afraid we can't
afford any more drinks.

227
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:24,131
Dos whiskeys, senorita!

228
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:27,101
"Dos whiskeys, senorita!"

229
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,239
Boom, one, two, three.

230
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,440
He says, meet me
outside the mine,

231
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:35,677
I said, you keep
running your mouth.

232
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,344
He didn't think
I would go there.

233
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,282
He had it
coming, he had it coming.

234
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,494
Hola, amigos.

235
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:59,801
Say, I don't suppose any
of you boys is boxers, huh?

236
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:04,304
Boxeo? El luchador?

237
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:07,040
Si, we can box.

238
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,644
Are you asking us to fight you?

239
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,379
I don't think you
would win, my friend.

240
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:15,182
No, I was just having a
little private conversation

241
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:17,652
with my famous friends
over there, Waco,

242
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:20,722
that's the Waco Kid by the way,
for those who are wondering,

243
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,189
and he was just telling me

244
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,358
how fond he was
of Mexican women,

245
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:27,394
so if any of you
have mothers or wives

246
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,296
or sisters or daughters there,

247
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:30,732
you better watch out, this...

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,368
Dios mio, hey, it is him.

249
00:15:35,837 --> 00:15:38,740
Please, Mr. Waco, I love to box,

250
00:15:38,773 --> 00:15:40,040
could you show us
some of your moves?

251
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:42,911
I'm sorry, kid, my
brawling days are over.

252
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,212
Please, just, just
one quick round?

253
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:49,383
Like a warmup? For me,
it would be my honor.

254
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,719
It's not gonna
happen, kid, sorry.

255
00:15:51,753 --> 00:15:54,154
We're exhausted, we're
heading up to our room.

256
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:56,156
Let's go, Waco.

257
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,391
His honor.

258
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:09,436
Nothing serious.

259
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:17,579
Just a little warmup.

260
00:16:17,612 --> 00:16:19,581
Exactly, yes, just a warmup.

261
00:16:19,614 --> 00:16:20,915
A warmup with a champ!

262
00:16:22,216 --> 00:16:22,884
A little slap box.

263
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,587
Yeah, okay, sure, sure.

264
00:16:27,956 --> 00:16:28,823
Don't overdo it.

265
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,393
Alright, let's
see what you got, kid.

266
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,900
Oh, what in the hell is this?

267
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:40,267
What?

268
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,937
Now. Don't you go nowhere.

269
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:44,271
I wouldn't dream of it.

270
00:16:52,647 --> 00:16:54,916
Evening, ma'am, pardon
the interruption.

271
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:56,049
I think it might be best

272
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,752
if we move you to another table.

273
00:16:57,785 --> 00:17:00,788
Oh. Is there going
to be an exhibition?

274
00:17:00,822 --> 00:17:02,624
I guess you could call it that,

275
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:05,292
but sometimes these
things get a little rowdy.

276
00:17:05,325 --> 00:17:06,661
Understood.

277
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:08,428
So, what is that you're reading?

278
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:10,297
"Dracula". Bram Stoker.

279
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,799
Ah.

280
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,133
Yeah, I just finished
that one myself

281
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:14,301
about a month and a half ago.

282
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:15,503
Really? How'd you like it?

283
00:17:15,537 --> 00:17:17,304
I quite enjoyed it.

284
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:18,640
I guess my favorite part was-

285
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:21,341
Oh no, please! I
only just started.

286
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,209
I understand.

287
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,846
My name's Dutch Langford.

288
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,146
Rosemary O'Rourke.

289
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,281
Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

290
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,616
Likewise.

291
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,084
What brings you to Oro
Lindo, Mr. Langford?

292
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,486
My partner and I are
traveling through,

293
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,321
we're doing a little
bounty hunting.

294
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,790
Ah, exciting.

295
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:38,927
Are you on the hunt?

296
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,862
Not at the moment, no.

297
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,430
In fact, we got us a nice little

298
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:45,232
high dollar bounty
earlier today.

299
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,602
I see.

300
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:50,505
And that high dollar bounty

301
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:51,471
wouldn't be the man making it

302
00:17:51,506 --> 00:17:53,273
for the door right
now, would it?

303
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:56,544
Oh no, he's dead. He's
tied up on the horses.

304
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:58,145
No, that other idiot is Zeke...

305
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:03,116
Hey. Waco, get him!

306
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:03,851
Huh?

307
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:10,357
Okay.

308
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,626
Excuse me, ma'am.

309
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:12,894
Get back here!

310
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:18,066
Whoa, hey!

311
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:18,933
Come on!

312
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:29,811
You got this, you got this!

313
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:31,211
Are you done now?

314
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:33,014
-Get your hands!
-Calm down.

315
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,182
No, I'm not gonna calm down,
now get me out of this chair!

316
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,551
Get me out of this chair.

317
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:40,521
-You got this, you got this!
-Come on!

318
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:07,782
-Get me out of this chair,
-Calm down!

319
00:19:07,815 --> 00:19:08,750
Get me out of this chair!

320
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:10,250
Dutch, outside.

321
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,422
Oh, sh-

322
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,491
Shut up! Waco!

323
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,696
Hold on!

324
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:29,336
Get back here! Where
are you going with that?

325
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,012
My dead body.

326
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,581
Let go of it.

327
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:45,153
Waco, can you help me over here?

328
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:35,536
Get out!

329
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:39,707
Get outta here!

330
00:21:17,745 --> 00:21:19,714
Sheriff's ready to
see you boys now.

331
00:21:24,585 --> 00:21:26,353
Body inside yours too?

332
00:21:27,722 --> 00:21:29,223
Nope.

333
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:30,091
He's useless.

334
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,130
I don't think he likes you.

335
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:46,541
Think they'll refund our room?

336
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:48,810
Not a chance.

337
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:52,713
Now, you ready?

338
00:21:52,747 --> 00:21:53,581
-Yep.
-Oh.

339
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:56,884
Be careful!

340
00:21:58,152 --> 00:21:59,787
Really? Waco?

341
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:15,435
So, who's the body
stinking up my porch?

342
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,104
Benicio Morales.

343
00:22:17,138 --> 00:22:18,706
The Slim Reaper?

344
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:20,708
The Sideways Scorpion.

345
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:24,111
He preferred The Tabasco Knife.

346
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:26,413
And I'm the man that killed him.

347
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:27,548
Sure did.

348
00:22:27,582 --> 00:22:29,083
Well unfortunately boys,

349
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:32,920
I can't pay out a bounty
that size in one day.

350
00:22:32,954 --> 00:22:34,222
You boys are gonna have
to wait around a while

351
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:36,324
until I can scrounge
up enough cash.

352
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,928
I thought this was a gold town.

353
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:43,631
So, how long do you
expect that to be?

354
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:45,633
We weren't planning
on staying long.

355
00:22:48,002 --> 00:22:51,672
That will be when
Thaddeus Vincent

356
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:54,609
decides to make
his next deposit.

357
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,779
Hello, gentlemen.

358
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:03,117
Sheriff Pearlwood, I
do hate to intrude,

359
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,452
but I'm afraid I must insist.

360
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,420
I have had quite a time

361
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:08,856
trying to get an
audience with you

362
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:11,692
and the matter that I
need to discuss is urgent.

363
00:23:11,726 --> 00:23:12,994
Well, be that as it may,

364
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:14,762
you're gonna have
to wait your turn.

365
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:17,598
See, I'm having a conversation
with these fine gentlemen.

366
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:19,767
-Sheriff, I understand-
-Now, please,

367
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,136
no need to send her
away on our account.

368
00:23:23,337 --> 00:23:24,739
Our business here is done.

369
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,944
Anyway, hey Deputy,
why don't you,

370
00:23:29,977 --> 00:23:32,179
why don't you show us
over to the undertaker?

371
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:38,686
I'd love to
show you to the undertaker.

372
00:23:45,393 --> 00:23:46,227
Ma'am.

373
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:48,062
Good luck.

374
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,096
Thank you.

375
00:23:53,401 --> 00:23:56,003
It appears you have an
opening in your schedule.

376
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:58,039
So there is.

377
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,544
As I mentioned in my letters,

378
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:05,346
my name is Rosemary O'Rourke.

379
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:06,547
Mhmm.

380
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:09,083
I work in close connection
with an orphanage in Boston

381
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,252
that has sent hundreds
of children out West

382
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:13,486
on the Orphan Trains, and
my job is to follow up

383
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:14,655
on the children's wellbeing,

384
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:17,058
make sure they're in
loving, good homes

385
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:18,392
with thoughtful families-

386
00:24:18,426 --> 00:24:21,062
Yeah, I've read your letters.

387
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:21,963
Superb.

388
00:24:22,363 --> 00:24:25,232
Then you know that there are
several Orphan Train children

389
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,767
that I have not
been able to locate

390
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:28,569
despite my considerable effort.

391
00:24:28,602 --> 00:24:29,537
It's a large county.

392
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,571
I've traversed much of it.

393
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:31,339
With a lot of farms.

394
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:32,673
I've been to all of them.

395
00:24:32,707 --> 00:24:35,042
Those children did
not leave Oro Lindo.

396
00:24:35,076 --> 00:24:36,077
This is a border town,

397
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,411
people go missing all the time.

398
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:40,281
Yes, but these are
children, Sheriff.

399
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:44,752
Children have gone
missing. And that matters.

400
00:24:46,087 --> 00:24:49,824
Dismissal of the subject is
most out of the question.

401
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:55,863
Now, it would be very helpful

402
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:58,966
if you could provide
me some sort of list

403
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,102
of local citizens or shop owners

404
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:03,304
that may have taken someone in.

405
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:06,273
I assume your benefactor,
Mr. Thaddeus Vincent

406
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:07,775
will be on that list as well.

407
00:25:08,676 --> 00:25:11,145
Sure, Miss.

408
00:25:12,646 --> 00:25:13,981
We can get you a list.

409
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:19,420
But it'll take us a day or so.

410
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:25,092
In a day or so.

411
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:29,363
Much obliged.

412
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:31,499
Thank you, gentlemen.

413
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,461
You've done it this time.

414
00:26:00,494 --> 00:26:02,496
Well, you know, I'm
impressed as hell

415
00:26:02,531 --> 00:26:05,800
that Thaddeus can shave an
ape and teach it to talk.

416
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,135
What other tricks do
you know, monkey boy?

417
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:10,037
Can't wait to squash you.

418
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:12,006
You better buy me flowers first.

419
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:15,109
Besides, you know
you can't touch me

420
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:18,979
unless the master lets
you off the leash.

421
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:22,316
Move.

422
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,229
All the families in this town,

423
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,231
we understand the
way things work.

424
00:26:38,199 --> 00:26:41,536
We are not blind whose name
is written on the wood beams

425
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,938
every time a new
building goes up.

426
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,207
I wouldn't have a home

427
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,342
if not for the loans
that you provided.

428
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:52,680
And I am more than happy
to pay for them back.

429
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:54,181
My brother Caleb as well.

430
00:26:56,016 --> 00:26:58,587
He works in your
mines every day.

431
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:01,922
He doesn't complain, he
doesn't make trouble.

432
00:27:03,357 --> 00:27:06,393
But I do see his
pain every morning

433
00:27:06,427 --> 00:27:10,364
and I watch him drag
himself home every night.

434
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:17,606
I have no illusions for
charity in this world.

435
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:22,076
My brother doesn't
know I'm here.

436
00:27:23,978 --> 00:27:26,113
But I come to say that
we are good people

437
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:29,783
who want to see a
real step forward

438
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:31,318
for all our hard work.

439
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:34,288
Not a step back.

440
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:38,159
A small leniency on
the interest, even.

441
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,796
As a self-made man, I'm
sure you understand that.

442
00:27:44,265 --> 00:27:46,767
My, my, my.

443
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,938
Miss Salazar, that is a
display of passion and rhetoric

444
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:54,141
I've not seen from a
politician in years.

445
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:57,278
And believe me, they
come by the wagon load

446
00:27:57,311 --> 00:27:59,581
to this humble little
country house of mine.

447
00:28:00,748 --> 00:28:02,316
That was quite the performance.

448
00:28:03,484 --> 00:28:07,154
Mr. Vincent, I did not
came here to perform.

449
00:28:07,188 --> 00:28:08,489
Only speak the truth.

450
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:11,158
Yes, of course.

451
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:15,729
Everyone endeavors
to speak the truth.

452
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:19,133
But the truth is
like anything else

453
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:20,602
between heaven and hell.

454
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:25,306
It is entirely
subject to the whims

455
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:27,441
of those who are in
possession of it.

456
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:32,780
Truth, Miss Salazar,
is like a tool

457
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:35,349
to get what one wants.

458
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:40,955
To fire at someone.

459
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:44,191
Mr. Vincent, there's
nothing I'm asking for here

460
00:28:44,225 --> 00:28:45,759
that will deprive you.

461
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:48,195
Ah, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

462
00:28:49,163 --> 00:28:50,030
There it is.

463
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:55,503
You've now gone from
the realm of your truth

464
00:28:57,505 --> 00:29:00,808
into the realm of my truth.

465
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,346
Your truth, Miss Salazar,
is based upon what you see,

466
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:07,047
what your people see.

467
00:29:08,882 --> 00:29:10,652
And that is not what I see.

468
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:17,559
You see a cow and
know it to be a meal.

469
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:21,663
I see a cow and know
it to precede a herd.

470
00:29:23,698 --> 00:29:27,034
You see a hut and
know it to be a home,

471
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:31,238
I see a hut and know it to
precede a thousand just like it.

472
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,708
Your people saw a
hole in the ground

473
00:29:33,742 --> 00:29:35,142
and said, nay, thou
shalt not go there

474
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:37,344
because there be demons.

475
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:38,513
But not I.

476
00:29:40,682 --> 00:29:44,785
Because I knew what God
left in there for me.

477
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:46,420
Gold.

478
00:29:48,922 --> 00:29:53,127
We are not alike and
I do not understand.

479
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:57,599
So, the subject of
your half-brother.

480
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,602
Your half-brother is a
drinker and a rabble rouser,

481
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:03,237
you know, maybe perhaps
if he were to spend

482
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,572
a little less of
his leisure time

483
00:30:04,606 --> 00:30:06,373
working on his right hook,

484
00:30:06,407 --> 00:30:08,610
he would be less desperate.

485
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:12,446
But.

486
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:22,757
I can see that he is a
special prize to you.

487
00:30:27,562 --> 00:30:31,231
I could treat him as one
of my special prizes.

488
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:36,136
Say my prize horse.

489
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:42,910
Do you know what I do
to them, Miss Salazar,

490
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:46,013
when they no longer
perform for me?

491
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:52,787
I put a bullet in their head.

492
00:30:57,324 --> 00:30:59,026
I put them out of their misery.

493
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:07,334
And I replace them with
something that benefits me.

494
00:31:13,474 --> 00:31:14,475
Am I clear?

495
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:20,648
There'll be no change

496
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:22,650
to your payment
schedule, Miss Salazar.

497
00:31:23,984 --> 00:31:27,722
I do not care one continental
for your disposition.

498
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,891
You and your people
will pay accordingly.

499
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:36,029
Be blessed on the way out.

500
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:49,544
Hoo! That is one
feisty chili pepper.

501
00:31:50,512 --> 00:31:53,380
Ah, ah, ah, do not sit
in the furniture, Zeke.

502
00:31:57,985 --> 00:31:59,687
How did everything go?

503
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:04,692
Oh, it, you know, it
went great.

504
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:05,593
Well, that's great.

505
00:32:07,094 --> 00:32:08,530
Send in Benicio.

506
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:09,531
Yeah, about that.

507
00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:13,735
Benicio is, he's, he's, he's-

508
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:14,903
Is he indisposed?

509
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:17,204
He's presupposed, that's
the word I was looking for.

510
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:20,140
And well, see,
complications arose

511
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:23,010
and things being
what they are, he's-

512
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:24,512
Dead as a door nail,

513
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:26,180
collecting flies
in a wooden shed

514
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:28,917
behind the undertaker's
shop, you desert canary.

515
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:29,751
You nailed it.

516
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:34,689
Is that what you call real
great, you incompetent fool?

517
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:40,895
I paid a small fortune
for that killer.

518
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:43,932
I'm forced to endure
37 asinine nicknames

519
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:45,667
anytime somebody
whispers about him and-

520
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,734
Well, there's more than that.

521
00:32:46,768 --> 00:32:49,737
And lo and behold,
lo and behold,

522
00:32:49,771 --> 00:32:52,707
not even a legend
can survive riding

523
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,441
with the likes of you, Zeke!

524
00:32:54,475 --> 00:32:56,076
Please.

525
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:59,279
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

526
00:32:59,313 --> 00:32:59,881
Not the face!

527
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:01,381
How many teeth, boss?

528
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:02,917
No, no, no, wait a
minute. Wait a minute.

529
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:04,184
Well, now, wait, wait!

530
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:08,021
We was bush whacked
by bounty hunters.

531
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:10,290
They popped off a
lucky shot on Morales.

532
00:33:10,324 --> 00:33:11,659
But I wasn't lying before.

533
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,728
Well, that was afterwards.

534
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:15,730
See, we did the job
we were sent to do.

535
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:18,031
We got the deed.

536
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:19,934
The farmer's not gonna
be a problem anymore,

537
00:33:19,968 --> 00:33:20,902
I promise you that.

538
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:23,403
The farmer's dead?

539
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:24,906
That's right.

540
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:27,441
I did it myself.
Popped him right there.

541
00:33:28,743 --> 00:33:32,914
I dropped his ass
down a well! Oh.

542
00:33:32,947 --> 00:33:34,314
The land is yours to dig, boss,

543
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:35,984
but I would not drink the water.

544
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:39,888
That was my favorite
uncle growing up.

545
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:41,756
My condolences.

546
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,791
But you didn't tell
us that part before.

547
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:48,596
He should've sold me
that land years ago.

548
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,899
Family is only a title of import

549
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:52,667
as long as you give
it leave to be.

550
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:54,969
Zeke, you remember that.

551
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:56,771
I always said that.
I've always said that.

552
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:57,839
Where's the deed?

553
00:34:00,374 --> 00:34:02,342
Well...

554
00:34:03,678 --> 00:34:05,145
It's a cute story.

555
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,214
You're gonna laugh.

556
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,852
It's in my saddlebags

557
00:34:10,885 --> 00:34:14,622
and the bounty
hunters have those.

558
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,356
But if you send the
bearded lady and me,

559
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:18,826
we'll take care of
it, lickety split.

560
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,995
No, not right now.

561
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:23,598
But I want you to
keep an eye on 'em.

562
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:25,934
We'll do it when
the time is right.

563
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:29,269
Send in the other boys when
you're on your way out.

564
00:34:29,303 --> 00:34:31,906
And Zeke? Do better.

565
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:36,143
I'm trying my damnedest, sir.

566
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:38,646
Can I have my gun
back, please?

567
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,281
Well, that's just being
rude and spiteful.

568
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:43,216
I'm gonna have to pick those up.

569
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,285
Ammunition is
expensive these days

570
00:34:45,319 --> 00:34:46,386
and you're just being careless,

571
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,322
what if the boss steps on 'em?

572
00:34:48,355 --> 00:34:49,189
That's, alright.

573
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,193
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

574
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:54,662
What you reading there, boss?

575
00:34:56,196 --> 00:35:00,200
Love letters from a
concerned citizen.

576
00:35:00,233 --> 00:35:01,468
Oh, there's
this girl in Abilene,

577
00:35:01,501 --> 00:35:02,570
she used to write to me twice-

578
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:11,012
Nope. Never heard of them.

579
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:13,047
Oh. I see.

580
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:18,753
The cobbler and the blacksmith
both told me you adopted.

581
00:35:19,687 --> 00:35:23,091
I truly hoped that I'd
find these children here.

582
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:25,727
Well sure, I adopted.

583
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,829
Had great success
with the Orphan Train.

584
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:29,262
Two little boys
and a little girl,

585
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:31,264
raised right here in this shop.

586
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:33,901
Poor things, barely knew
their folks back East

587
00:35:33,935 --> 00:35:35,235
before the cough took 'em.

588
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:36,370
I wasn't ready to
be no daddy, though,

589
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:37,170
I'll tell you that.

590
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:39,239
They called me
Gabe, same as any.

591
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:40,273
I raised them right, though.

592
00:35:40,307 --> 00:35:42,610
They're good kids, all of them.

593
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:44,879
That's wonderful to hear.

594
00:35:46,114 --> 00:35:47,582
Are they around?

595
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:49,449
They haven't been
around for years.

596
00:35:51,653 --> 00:35:55,255
Around here, we tend to
bring them up pretty quick

597
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:56,758
and they let out the second

598
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,593
they feel like
they're old enough to.

599
00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:00,260
Like I said, I'm no daddy.

600
00:36:00,293 --> 00:36:02,597
I couldn't have kept the shop
afloat without 'em, though.

601
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,100
'Cause Lord knows Mr. Vincent's

602
00:36:06,134 --> 00:36:08,136
got us all up to our
damn ears in debt.

603
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:11,639
The girl.

604
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:14,909
Her name wasn't Violet was it?

605
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,277
No, no, her name was Sarah.

606
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:21,115
I see.

607
00:36:22,617 --> 00:36:24,786
Well, I'd still love to record

608
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:27,088
all their names and
ages if you don't mind.

609
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,993
You mentioned Mr.
Thaddeus Vincent.

610
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,263
I've heard his name mentioned
multiple times, today alone.

611
00:36:37,165 --> 00:36:39,167
And I have found it quite common

612
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,503
for a person of means to
adopt quite frequently.

613
00:36:43,504 --> 00:36:45,006
Have you ever seen Mr. Vincent

614
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,575
or one of his representatives
at the train station

615
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:48,810
when the orphans arrive?

616
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:50,812
Oh yeah, they're out
there every time.

617
00:36:58,986 --> 00:37:01,354
You know what, ma'am?
I must be mistaken.

618
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:06,594
I am old, my memory
does slip often.

619
00:37:06,627 --> 00:37:08,663
I just don't think I
can help you today.

620
00:37:42,697 --> 00:37:43,965
-Come on, let's go.
-Alright,

621
00:37:43,998 --> 00:37:44,532
let's get outta here.

622
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:48,903
She's over there!

623
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,071
Hey, I'm trying!

624
00:37:50,104 --> 00:37:51,906
Get my hat, put it on my head.

625
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:54,208
It's heavy, it's heavy!

626
00:37:54,242 --> 00:37:56,244
I know it's heavy,
you're heavy too.

627
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:57,545
I will cut you in half!

628
00:37:57,578 --> 00:37:59,479
Get off me, get off me!

629
00:37:59,514 --> 00:38:00,548
Get outta here.

630
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:02,850
He does that to me too.

631
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:08,388
Oh! Oh!

632
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:10,625
Oh my Lord, I am so sorry.

633
00:38:11,225 --> 00:38:12,560
Are you okay?

634
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:15,428
Be as sorry as you like, Miss.

635
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:18,566
You'll never be as
sorry as a mining man.

636
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,333
-Here, let me help you.
-I don't believe I ever saw

637
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:23,538
a nugget like you
in this town before.

638
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:28,075
What's a town like you
doing in a woman like this?

639
00:38:29,043 --> 00:38:30,845
Really, sir, the
day is far too young

640
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:34,682
to be in such a state, do
not lean upon this man.

641
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:35,716
What state?

642
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,286
This is the state
of Thaddeus Vincent.

643
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,055
Where men are things
to be leaned upon,

644
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:42,957
he knows it as well as I do.

645
00:38:44,192 --> 00:38:49,764
And you, you can lean on me
anytime you like.

646
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:52,633
I'm real hands, handy.

647
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:53,768
How about you hold onto these?

648
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:56,737
Oh! Ah!

649
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:02,977
Why don't you put that
toothpick away, son,

650
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,145
before somebody gets hurt?

651
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:07,281
You wanna remove your hand?

652
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,117
Don't overdo it.

653
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:10,551
What?

654
00:39:33,274 --> 00:39:34,008
Thanks.

655
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:39,013
Lookie what I found.

656
00:39:40,314 --> 00:39:41,381
Get her, Concho.

657
00:39:57,365 --> 00:39:59,166
Not to me! Whoa!

658
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,205
Oh, oh God!

659
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:56,557
Come on.

660
00:40:58,092 --> 00:40:59,492
Night night.

661
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:08,069
-Hey.
-Whoa.

662
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:09,136
Hold it right there, son.

663
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:11,305
You don't want this.

664
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:13,641
Yeah, that was a
fine scrap and all.

665
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:16,911
But you skin leather,

666
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:18,946
becomes something
totally different.

667
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,848
It's not a fight
you wake up from.

668
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:22,416
You ain't that fast, old man!

669
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:27,655
Well.

670
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:30,858
That was quite the fandango.

671
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:32,860
Well, good afternoon,
Miss O'Rourke.

672
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:33,961
Dutch, Waco.

673
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:35,963
-Ma'am.
-Lovely to see you both.

674
00:41:35,997 --> 00:41:37,965
How are you enjoying your stay?

675
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:39,867
Fair enough, I reckon.

676
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,536
Although I am beginning
to notice a pattern.

677
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,206
Yeah, every time she's
around, I get hit in the face.

678
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,974
That wasn't what I
was referring to.

679
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,644
Well, seems you gave quite
a bit more than you got.

680
00:41:50,678 --> 00:41:51,812
First rule of a fight.

681
00:41:51,846 --> 00:41:52,680
Indeed.

682
00:41:53,647 --> 00:41:55,850
I have worked up an appetite.

683
00:41:56,817 --> 00:41:59,920
What do you boys say to
joining me for a bite?

684
00:41:59,954 --> 00:42:01,822
Southways a bit.

685
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:04,125
I don't care too much
for the hospitality

686
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:05,826
on this side of town.

687
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,794
Oh, here, let me.

688
00:42:10,031 --> 00:42:13,634
I feel the manners improving
around us already. Ma'am?

689
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,302
You should start a charm school.

690
00:42:17,772 --> 00:42:19,340
So, how do you do
that? You just?

691
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:22,243
-You just, yeah.
-It's cool.

692
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,536
Roy.

693
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:49,504
These men,

694
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:56,110
these boys got themselves
something to report.

695
00:42:56,143 --> 00:42:57,845
It's a street fight, Eli.

696
00:42:57,878 --> 00:42:59,713
That ain't what they say.

697
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:03,150
So you want me to take testimony

698
00:43:03,184 --> 00:43:07,154
of a man who loses a fight
yet claims otherwise?

699
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:10,291
I do that, I'm gonna
have to take testimony

700
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:12,561
of every pair of
hands in this town.

701
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:16,931
We have ourselves a duty to act.

702
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:19,568
Don't you?

703
00:43:22,436 --> 00:43:26,474
Pearl. I am so glad you're here.

704
00:43:26,508 --> 00:43:28,709
I would like to report a crime.

705
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:30,244
Pearlwood.

706
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:31,712
Right.

707
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:33,747
More importantly, there's
been a vicious attack

708
00:43:33,781 --> 00:43:35,182
on men in my employ.

709
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:38,786
Initiated with their
backs turned, no less.

710
00:43:40,054 --> 00:43:41,222
The cowardice of some men,

711
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:43,424
it never ceases to sadden me.

712
00:43:44,425 --> 00:43:47,862
I trust, Pearl, Sheriff, that
you will treat this crime

713
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:50,397
with the severity and
sentencing that it deserves.

714
00:43:56,704 --> 00:43:57,938
I would like to introduce you

715
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:00,575
to my daughter,
adopted daughter.

716
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:03,277
Lizzie, come child.

717
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:06,714
It's okay, take my hand. Good.

718
00:44:11,152 --> 00:44:14,889
We need to uphold the
laws in this town,

719
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:19,628
if for no other reason,
do it for the children.

720
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:30,771
I'm glad to see that you're
taking justice so seriously.

721
00:44:32,439 --> 00:44:35,009
I've taken the liberty
of forming you a posse.

722
00:44:36,177 --> 00:44:37,344
Starting with myself.

723
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:40,181
You're welcome.

724
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:03,771
I'll order us something.
You boys grab us a table.

725
00:45:06,641 --> 00:45:08,809
Well boys, deal me in.

726
00:45:08,842 --> 00:45:11,445
Better yet, pass me
the California Bible

727
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:13,347
and let me have a shuffle.

728
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,382
Have you ever heard
of Three-card Monte?

729
00:45:16,651 --> 00:45:19,053
Another time, Waco.
We got grub coming.

730
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:36,036
Well, they had stew,
stew, and stew.

731
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,037
I didn't know what you prefer

732
00:45:37,071 --> 00:45:38,939
so I went with the stew.

733
00:45:38,973 --> 00:45:40,341
Hope that's alright.

734
00:45:40,374 --> 00:45:44,478
I guess it'll just have
to stew.

735
00:45:47,881 --> 00:45:50,050
So, Miss O'Rourke-

736
00:45:50,084 --> 00:45:52,554
Oh. Rosemary is just fine.

737
00:45:52,587 --> 00:45:56,156
Rosemary, you know what
Waco and I are doing here

738
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,459
but we never had the
chance to ask you.

739
00:45:58,492 --> 00:45:59,493
Care to share?

740
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:02,229
Not to pile on, but I'm
quite curious myself.

741
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,735
Well, have you ever heard
of the Orphan Trains?

742
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:08,235
-Mhmm.
-Sure have.

743
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:10,371
I've heard 'em
called Mercy Trains.

744
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:12,840
Always wondered if
that was strictly true.

745
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:15,075
Well, it mostly is.

746
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:18,412
However, I have recently
found the records lacking

747
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:20,247
as to the wellbeing
of those children

748
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:22,584
once they're adopted
off the trains.

749
00:46:22,617 --> 00:46:27,087
So I have taken it upon
myself to follow up,

750
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:28,956
make sure they're
properly cared for.

751
00:46:33,294 --> 00:46:34,261
My sister and I,

752
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:38,032
we were sent out West
in an Orphan Train.

753
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:42,369
So I know firsthand just how
rough of a life that can be.

754
00:46:45,105 --> 00:46:47,341
And therefore I am doing my best

755
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:50,010
to prevent other children

756
00:46:50,044 --> 00:46:52,112
from having rough lives as well.

757
00:46:53,715 --> 00:46:55,550
Yeah, well, as
heavy as that seems

758
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:57,951
that's a mighty
fine cross to bear.

759
00:46:57,985 --> 00:47:00,220
So, what about your sister?

760
00:47:00,254 --> 00:47:01,455
Does she work with you?

761
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:09,496
I am sure she would.

762
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:15,469
So, are there children
from the Orphan Train

763
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:16,870
here in Oro Lindo?

764
00:47:16,904 --> 00:47:20,642
And have you found
them? Are they okay?

765
00:47:20,675 --> 00:47:21,942
As it turns out,

766
00:47:21,975 --> 00:47:24,078
there is suspiciously
little information

767
00:47:24,111 --> 00:47:26,614
I can find regarding
their whereabouts.

768
00:47:26,648 --> 00:47:27,915
The sheriff and the deputy

769
00:47:27,948 --> 00:47:31,385
are about as useful as
a couple of songbirds

770
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:32,554
in an orchestra.

771
00:47:32,587 --> 00:47:34,121
Yeah, we've got a
similar opinion.

772
00:47:34,154 --> 00:47:35,122
Hmm.

773
00:47:35,155 --> 00:47:38,092
My only lead is the
troubling encounter

774
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,761
I had with the shopkeeper.

775
00:47:39,794 --> 00:47:41,228
He was very forthcoming,

776
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:42,996
right up until
Thaddeus Vincent's men

777
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,164
made their appearance.

778
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:45,734
So this Vincent character,

779
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:46,801
you think he has something to do

780
00:47:46,835 --> 00:47:48,570
with these children missing?

781
00:47:48,603 --> 00:47:51,905
His name keeps popping up
in all the worst places.

782
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:54,441
I am not sure,
but I have decided

783
00:47:54,475 --> 00:47:56,544
I am not leaving
until I find them.

784
00:47:58,212 --> 00:47:59,647
I apologize for intruding.

785
00:48:00,548 --> 00:48:02,116
But I know where
the children are.

786
00:48:02,149 --> 00:48:03,350
What? You do?

787
00:48:03,384 --> 00:48:04,318
Who are you?

788
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,487
Oh, I'm sorry, that
was a little rude.

789
00:48:06,521 --> 00:48:09,356
What I mean is,
what is your name?

790
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,358
My name is Lita Salazar.

791
00:48:11,392 --> 00:48:13,628
I live in town with
my brother Caleb.

792
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:16,463
He works in Mr.
Vincent's gold mines.

793
00:48:16,497 --> 00:48:18,165
So there is gold in this town.

794
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:20,635
Hardly.

795
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,105
The town itself never sees it.

796
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:27,141
The gold is mined by its people,

797
00:48:27,174 --> 00:48:29,977
but it stays hoarded
with Senor Vincent.

798
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,747
That and half of the towns debt.

799
00:48:33,748 --> 00:48:34,716
And the children?

800
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:37,652
The mines.

801
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,422
That's where the children are.

802
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:46,326
What? That can't be.

803
00:48:47,595 --> 00:48:48,429
It's true.

804
00:48:50,197 --> 00:48:52,132
Most people in town don't know.

805
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:54,769
Mr. Vincent tries
to keep it a secret.

806
00:48:55,936 --> 00:48:57,371
But my brother
Caleb has seen it.

807
00:48:58,673 --> 00:49:00,240
Caleb!

808
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:20,060
Oh, Senor Waco! So
good to see you.

809
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:21,696
My spine is crooked.

810
00:49:21,729 --> 00:49:23,263
Yeah, I think I
left a tooth or two

811
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:24,766
on the floorboards over here.

812
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:27,769
Very fun, ah, we should
go another round.

813
00:49:27,802 --> 00:49:30,337
Easy. Only the
first round's free.

814
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,573
Ay.

815
00:49:31,606 --> 00:49:34,007
Caleb, it's
time to be serious.

816
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,643
We're talking about Mr. Vincent.

817
00:49:48,823 --> 00:49:50,224
What do they wanna know?

818
00:49:50,257 --> 00:49:53,327
Is it true that he has
children working in the mines?

819
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:01,435
It is.

820
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:06,440
I've seen them with my own eyes.

821
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:08,977
Only certain workers, those
of us who go in the deepest,

822
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:09,978
have seen them.

823
00:50:11,445 --> 00:50:13,046
Mr. Vincent uses the children

824
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,314
to get into the crevices

825
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:16,551
and other places that myself

826
00:50:16,584 --> 00:50:18,686
and the other adults
can't fit into.

827
00:50:21,321 --> 00:50:24,157
We try to make it as easy
as we can for them in there.

828
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:25,894
Sometimes we even
squeeze ourselves down

829
00:50:25,927 --> 00:50:27,896
to keep them from
doing anything.

830
00:50:27,929 --> 00:50:30,197
But it's dangerous and
we're watched closely.

831
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:34,468
Sometimes his men come
down with us and, well,

832
00:50:38,606 --> 00:50:39,707
when that happens,

833
00:50:41,108 --> 00:50:43,511
sometimes the children
don't always come back out.

834
00:50:45,513 --> 00:50:48,616
And you've never done
anything to stop him?

835
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,018
It's not that easy.

836
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,519
It must be!

837
00:50:51,553 --> 00:50:52,787
I'm sure you've
heard the expression

838
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,421
don't bite the hand
that feeds you.

839
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:57,692
Well, I doubt that
applies to evil hands.

840
00:50:57,725 --> 00:50:59,293
Something must be done.

841
00:50:59,326 --> 00:51:01,930
No offense, senorita,
but that's easy to say

842
00:51:01,963 --> 00:51:03,665
as someone who
does not live here.

843
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:10,370
My brother is right, his
name is in everything.

844
00:51:11,673 --> 00:51:15,475
He owns the land. He
owns our livelihoods.

845
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:17,745
He owns the law.

846
00:51:19,212 --> 00:51:22,416
Anyone who stands up to
Vincent ends up dead.

847
00:51:23,751 --> 00:51:25,053
But you are right too.

848
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:30,725
I am tired of just surviving.

849
00:51:30,758 --> 00:51:33,761
If I am going to live, it
has to be for something.

850
00:51:35,029 --> 00:51:37,497
We have to stop Vincent.

851
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:39,266
Win or lose, we have to try.

852
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:43,671
I've known bad men all my life.

853
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:47,441
I've rode with them and
I've chased them down.

854
00:51:48,576 --> 00:51:50,210
But one thing I
know for certain,

855
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,715
a bad man that's got away
with something for so long

856
00:51:53,748 --> 00:51:54,616
ain't gonna stop.

857
00:51:58,218 --> 00:51:59,787
It's gonna come down to a fight

858
00:52:01,288 --> 00:52:04,058
and when it does,
you got Waco and me.

859
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:07,095
Damn right.

860
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:08,997
Ain't nothing worth
getting up for

861
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,632
like putting bruises on a bully.

862
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:12,634
I'm in.

863
00:52:14,569 --> 00:52:15,970
A lot of people are scared.

864
00:52:17,572 --> 00:52:19,373
But if anyone can
lift this town up,

865
00:52:20,608 --> 00:52:24,244
it's Lita and I'm with her.

866
00:52:26,648 --> 00:52:28,116
Well.

867
00:52:28,148 --> 00:52:30,118
Then we have our team.

868
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:33,286
And we start by
rescuing those children.

869
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:43,564
That's him. Mr. Vincent.

870
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:46,400
Looks like a snake on stilts.

871
00:52:47,735 --> 00:52:48,670
That's Lizzie.

872
00:52:49,671 --> 00:52:51,606
She's one of the
missing children.

873
00:52:52,507 --> 00:52:54,575
Ooh, that vulture!

874
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:12,292
Better.

875
00:53:21,602 --> 00:53:22,870
Miss O'Rourke, I presume.

876
00:53:25,673 --> 00:53:28,408
Thaddeus Vincent.
Charmed to meet you.

877
00:53:28,442 --> 00:53:29,443
Mr. Vincent.

878
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:32,980
Normally I'd say pleased to
make your acquaintance but-

879
00:53:33,014 --> 00:53:34,849
Yes, of course you are.

880
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:36,651
My acquaintance
pleases everyone.

881
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:40,788
Dutch, are you pleased?

882
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:42,990
Nope.

883
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:45,693
I can assure you, gentlemen,

884
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:50,631
that you will not be a jesting
mood when we are through.

885
00:53:51,498 --> 00:53:55,469
I shall address you last.

886
00:53:55,502 --> 00:53:59,207
But first, I came
all the way down here

887
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,908
to allay the lady's fears.

888
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:04,612
I would like to present
to you my daughter,

889
00:54:04,645 --> 00:54:08,049
whom I love as if she
were my own blood.

890
00:54:08,082 --> 00:54:10,718
Lizzie, come say hi
to Miss O'Rourke.

891
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:13,386
Shake her hand like a lady.

892
00:54:15,089 --> 00:54:15,923
Hello.

893
00:54:27,602 --> 00:54:28,435
Hi, Lizzie.

894
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:31,506
It is very nice to meet you.

895
00:54:34,842 --> 00:54:37,410
Are you quite happy in
your home with Mr. Vincent?

896
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:38,278
Her father.

897
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:42,315
And yes she is.

898
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:45,153
She has everything that
she could want or need.

899
00:54:45,186 --> 00:54:48,523
I was speaking to her.

900
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,764
Lizzie, when you arrived
at that train station,

901
00:54:57,698 --> 00:54:59,534
you were with other
children, right?

902
00:54:59,567 --> 00:55:01,903
-Yes, but-
-Oh, my dear Miss O'Rourke,

903
00:55:01,936 --> 00:55:04,572
I'm sure you do
not mean to offend,

904
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:08,609
but you are dealing with
things you do not understand.

905
00:55:08,643 --> 00:55:10,912
It is quite callous of you
to bring up the children

906
00:55:10,945 --> 00:55:12,445
in front of my sweet daughter.

907
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:16,250
I try to shield her from having
to think about such things.

908
00:55:17,151 --> 00:55:21,522
However, since the
subject has been broached,

909
00:55:21,556 --> 00:55:24,759
I can see that you will not be
satisfied until it is aired.

910
00:55:24,792 --> 00:55:27,795
The children, they were naughty.

911
00:55:29,597 --> 00:55:31,933
Thieves. Runaways.

912
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,802
Isn't that right, Lizzie?

913
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:40,308
Go ahead and tell them.

914
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:43,410
Tell them about how
they woke you up

915
00:55:43,443 --> 00:55:44,812
in the middle of the night.

916
00:55:46,446 --> 00:55:49,016
About how they were going
to steal from your father,

917
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:52,286
catch a train to Wichita.

918
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:55,723
About how they wanted
you to go with them,

919
00:55:55,756 --> 00:56:00,995
but you would never dream
of doing such a thing.

920
00:56:02,129 --> 00:56:06,868
It's a shame to see them fall
into infantile selfishness.

921
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:13,307
But, kids these days.
What are you gonna do?

922
00:56:14,976 --> 00:56:16,878
It's so hard to find a good one.

923
00:56:20,715 --> 00:56:24,051
Now that you know the
truth, Miss O'Rourke,

924
00:56:25,385 --> 00:56:28,155
I trust that we will never
have to speak of this again.

925
00:56:28,189 --> 00:56:31,659
You can see how it
hurts my daughter so,

926
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,962
and that breaks my heart.

927
00:56:37,665 --> 00:56:40,334
She's been through
so much already.

928
00:56:40,368 --> 00:56:41,335
Wouldn't you agree?

929
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:48,376
Good.

930
00:56:52,346 --> 00:56:55,549
I am so disappointed in you two.

931
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:58,319
I thought you were more
than these criminals.

932
00:56:58,352 --> 00:56:59,854
But I can see that I was wrong

933
00:56:59,887 --> 00:57:02,823
and that is something
I do not say often.

934
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:07,427
So, I'm going to
purchase this rat hole.

935
00:57:08,596 --> 00:57:10,898
It'll cost me what
I have in my pocket.

936
00:57:10,932 --> 00:57:12,833
Maybe a little less, look at me.

937
00:57:13,935 --> 00:57:16,270
Look at me.

938
00:57:18,773 --> 00:57:21,642
I will have you dismantle this
place with your bare hands

939
00:57:21,676 --> 00:57:24,545
until there's nothing
left but rock and rubble.

940
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:26,213
And when your friends
and family see it,

941
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:28,249
they will know that
you destroyed

942
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:30,751
a part of their community

943
00:57:30,785 --> 00:57:32,620
because of your selfishness.

944
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,227
Old chums.

945
00:57:44,398 --> 00:57:48,602
Last and most certainly least,

946
00:57:48,636 --> 00:57:51,072
you ride into my town
like barbarians of old

947
00:57:51,105 --> 00:57:53,107
to harry a civilized world.

948
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:56,844
Barbarians. I like that.

949
00:57:56,877 --> 00:57:58,112
It is befitting.

950
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:00,147
What was that?

951
00:58:02,149 --> 00:58:05,820
Live by the sword, die by the
sword? I believe that's it.

952
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,725
It's time to put your
metal where your mouth is.

953
00:58:13,327 --> 00:58:16,764
Step outside. Settle this.

954
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:19,633
Like men.

955
00:58:28,843 --> 00:58:29,677
Shall we?

956
00:58:39,653 --> 00:58:41,088
Don't come out, they'll shoot!

957
00:58:42,957 --> 00:58:43,691
Come on.

958
00:58:46,093 --> 00:58:48,329
Sheriff, ready to do your job.

959
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:57,638
We have to go after them.

960
00:58:57,671 --> 00:58:58,606
We will.

961
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:02,209
We need to take that
kid's warning serious.

962
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:04,612
Waco, you wanna go take a look

963
00:59:04,645 --> 00:59:07,516
and see how many partygoers
we need to plan for?

964
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:11,485
He is an absolute monster.

965
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,987
And he means every word.

966
00:59:14,021 --> 00:59:15,423
If we get out of this,

967
00:59:15,456 --> 00:59:17,191
we need to get you
out of this town.

968
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:18,492
I am not leaving.

969
00:59:22,863 --> 00:59:24,131
Don't look good.

970
00:59:24,165 --> 00:59:26,333
He's out there with the
sheriff, that snake deputy,

971
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:28,002
and a whole mess of men.

972
00:59:28,035 --> 00:59:30,905
They're armed to the teeth
and they're ready to shoot.

973
00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:33,808
Maybe they would listen to me,

974
00:59:33,841 --> 00:59:36,545
maybe I could reason with them.

975
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:37,878
You got a way with words

976
00:59:37,912 --> 00:59:39,947
but he wouldn't listen
even if your tongue

977
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,882
was made of pure silver.

978
00:59:41,916 --> 00:59:42,850
He's right.

979
00:59:43,918 --> 00:59:46,420
Vincent only speaks
one language.

980
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:48,255
Gold.

981
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,925
We could go out fighting.

982
00:59:51,992 --> 00:59:54,061
We have the advantage
being in here.

983
00:59:54,095 --> 00:59:56,565
We can start shooting
and see what happens.

984
00:59:56,597 --> 00:59:57,532
Slow down, Poncho.

985
00:59:57,566 --> 00:59:59,066
Absolutely not.

986
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,136
That would risk Lizzie being
caught in the crossfire.

987
01:00:02,169 --> 01:00:03,538
Come on out, boys!

988
01:00:12,581 --> 01:00:15,850
If gold is all he understands,

989
01:00:15,883 --> 01:00:17,451
I say we go speak his language.

990
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:20,421
Okay.

991
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:21,922
I think I like where
you're going with this.

992
01:00:21,956 --> 01:00:23,891
-You with me?
-'Til the end.

993
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:25,527
What are you doing?

994
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:28,896
If we walk out
there wearing irons,

995
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:31,165
we'd be dead on the doorstep.

996
01:00:31,198 --> 01:00:33,434
This is the only way
we're gonna get close.

997
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:34,468
To the what?

998
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:36,904
Bargain.

999
01:00:38,272 --> 01:00:39,073
You ready?

1000
01:00:39,106 --> 01:00:40,307
Let's do it.

1001
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:48,215
Wait, if I'm dying, I'm
going out an honest man.

1002
01:00:51,586 --> 01:00:54,188
Oh, shit,
Waco.

1003
01:00:54,221 --> 01:00:56,957
Alright, let's not go
out there too pretty.

1004
01:00:56,991 --> 01:00:59,827
Rub some dirt on your face
and let me do the talking.

1005
01:01:05,567 --> 01:01:07,001
Alright, we're coming out.

1006
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:09,638
We ain't wearing guns.

1007
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:10,505
Alright.

1008
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,949
We just wanna talk.

1009
01:01:21,982 --> 01:01:23,652
Well, come talk.

1010
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:26,353
Now, Sheriff, you used
to be a gunfighter.

1011
01:01:28,022 --> 01:01:29,123
Used to be.

1012
01:01:29,156 --> 01:01:30,724
You still fast?

1013
01:01:30,758 --> 01:01:31,992
One way to find out.

1014
01:01:34,195 --> 01:01:35,763
Alright, listen, we're
gonna come closer.

1015
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:38,832
What I got to say
is for your ears

1016
01:01:38,866 --> 01:01:40,801
and for Mr. Vincent.

1017
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:42,604
Come slow.

1018
01:01:42,637 --> 01:01:43,871
But we're in your care.

1019
01:01:45,306 --> 01:01:49,210
On your honor, as a lawman,

1020
01:01:49,243 --> 01:01:52,179
and a fellow gunfighter.

1021
01:01:53,314 --> 01:01:53,981
Shoot 'em.

1022
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:55,182
They're unarmed.

1023
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:56,150
Sheriff.

1024
01:01:56,183 --> 01:01:59,554
They're unarmed, Mr. Vincent.

1025
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:02,890
Alright, that's
far enough, boys.

1026
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:07,294
Keep them hands up.
Speak your piece.

1027
01:02:07,328 --> 01:02:10,097
I don't think we have
to argue our innocence.

1028
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:11,432
Any doubts on that front,

1029
01:02:11,465 --> 01:02:13,968
our boots would be
kissing the sky already.

1030
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:16,370
So for now, we'd just
like to make a deal

1031
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:17,972
with Mr. Vincent.

1032
01:02:18,005 --> 01:02:19,674
And why would I
wanna waste my breath

1033
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:21,942
with you gone goslings?

1034
01:02:21,976 --> 01:02:23,410
You know who my partner is?

1035
01:02:25,012 --> 01:02:25,813
I do not.

1036
01:02:25,846 --> 01:02:26,681
I do.

1037
01:02:27,582 --> 01:02:28,550
I'll bet you do.

1038
01:02:29,883 --> 01:02:32,253
It's the Waco Kid.
Bare knuckle boxer.

1039
01:02:33,354 --> 01:02:34,989
Old champion.

1040
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:36,390
I'm not that old.

1041
01:02:36,423 --> 01:02:39,059
Too old. One foot in the grave.

1042
01:02:39,093 --> 01:02:40,060
I only need one foot

1043
01:02:40,094 --> 01:02:42,263
to dance around you in
the ring, big fella.

1044
01:02:43,264 --> 01:02:45,899
Looked up to you 'til you lost.

1045
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:48,570
Got no respect for losers.

1046
01:02:49,571 --> 01:02:51,640
You gonna write a
man off for one loss

1047
01:02:51,673 --> 01:02:53,874
after a career of wins?

1048
01:02:53,907 --> 01:02:56,043
You're dumber than you look.

1049
01:02:56,076 --> 01:02:58,078
And you look like you
got a knife so dull

1050
01:02:58,112 --> 01:02:59,813
you couldn't slice
through hot butter.

1051
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:01,282
Ah, ah.

1052
01:03:07,388 --> 01:03:11,693
Alright, somebody
want to please explain

1053
01:03:11,726 --> 01:03:14,729
the value of an old,
broken down boxer

1054
01:03:14,763 --> 01:03:17,164
to Thaddeus Vincent, hmm?

1055
01:03:17,197 --> 01:03:18,165
You may not have heard of him

1056
01:03:18,198 --> 01:03:19,933
from behind your ivory walls,

1057
01:03:21,135 --> 01:03:23,070
but I'd bet high
that all these men

1058
01:03:24,204 --> 01:03:25,406
and all the men in your
surrounding counties

1059
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,007
know who he is.

1060
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:28,075
Sheriff?

1061
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:29,476
Yeah, I knew him on sight.

1062
01:03:31,145 --> 01:03:32,813
I saw him fight a while back.

1063
01:03:33,947 --> 01:03:35,482
Yeah, he's got
something special.

1064
01:03:37,251 --> 01:03:39,721
Well, shit. I might blush.

1065
01:03:41,255 --> 01:03:45,159
So you announce a prize fight,

1066
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:47,762
come back of the Waco kid.

1067
01:03:49,463 --> 01:03:51,700
I promise you,
you'll see more money

1068
01:03:51,733 --> 01:03:54,636
and more people flowing
through this town in one day

1069
01:03:54,669 --> 01:03:55,737
than you've seen in years.

1070
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:56,604
Hmm.

1071
01:03:59,741 --> 01:04:00,608
And the opponent?

1072
01:04:01,643 --> 01:04:03,143
The big guy seems up for it.

1073
01:04:04,912 --> 01:04:06,548
He is big.

1074
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:08,415
Long way to the ground.

1075
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:11,418
He'll kill you.

1076
01:04:11,452 --> 01:04:12,654
I've heard that a lot.

1077
01:04:13,822 --> 01:04:17,826
So if I agree, what's
your end of the bargain?

1078
01:04:17,891 --> 01:04:20,528
Now, first off, we walk away

1079
01:04:21,763 --> 01:04:24,532
and you leave all these
folks in this cantina alone.

1080
01:04:25,767 --> 01:04:27,334
Me and Waco started this fight.

1081
01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:30,003
We'll finish it.

1082
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:33,608
And?

1083
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:36,877
And if Waco wins, you pay
us the Morales bounty.

1084
01:04:38,513 --> 01:04:41,616
No matter what happens, you
keep all the fight money,

1085
01:04:41,649 --> 01:04:43,350
you never see us again.

1086
01:04:43,384 --> 01:04:45,219
What's to keep you
from rigging it?

1087
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:49,022
Ah, Waco's too bullheaded
to throw a fight.

1088
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:52,226
By the look in his eyes,

1089
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:55,295
he knows he'll never
get this chance again.

1090
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:57,431
I don't know how to take that.

1091
01:04:57,464 --> 01:04:58,465
It's okay.

1092
01:05:00,067 --> 01:05:02,903
What of Miss O'Rourke and
her concerns for my...

1093
01:05:06,907 --> 01:05:07,742
My family?

1094
01:05:10,578 --> 01:05:12,179
It's not our problem.

1095
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:15,916
We just came here
to make a buck.

1096
01:05:17,184 --> 01:05:19,219
You want this town?
It's all yours.

1097
01:05:19,253 --> 01:05:20,722
We just want what we're owed.

1098
01:05:31,198 --> 01:05:36,203
Alright. What's your
answer, Mr. Vincent?

1099
01:05:39,239 --> 01:05:40,909
Well, I do love money.

1100
01:05:40,941 --> 01:05:42,009
Yes you do.

1101
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:45,680
Let's have ourselves a prize
fight, what do you guys say?

1102
01:05:45,713 --> 01:05:46,548
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1103
01:05:51,853 --> 01:05:55,389
It would be a very bad idea
to double cross me, boys.

1104
01:05:55,422 --> 01:05:56,724
We'll keep that in mind.

1105
01:05:57,926 --> 01:05:58,760
Hm.

1106
01:06:02,864 --> 01:06:04,264
Kill him in the ring.

1107
01:06:04,298 --> 01:06:05,432
My pleasure.

1108
01:06:05,466 --> 01:06:06,366
That's my boy.

1109
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:58,211
Well hello there, mastermind,
how's the plan going?

1110
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:01,983
Good. I suppose.

1111
01:08:02,016 --> 01:08:03,918
That is to say we have one.

1112
01:08:06,253 --> 01:08:07,087
But...

1113
01:08:08,756 --> 01:08:09,591
I don't know.

1114
01:08:11,491 --> 01:08:14,028
I'm sure you and Dutch
have had many an adventure

1115
01:08:14,062 --> 01:08:19,734
where death was on the
line, but this is my first,

1116
01:08:20,233 --> 01:08:22,269
and I have to admit,
I'm quite nervous.

1117
01:08:23,236 --> 01:08:24,772
Nervous is a good thing.

1118
01:08:26,373 --> 01:08:27,240
It means you're smart enough

1119
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:28,676
to worry about staying alive.

1120
01:08:29,611 --> 01:08:30,845
Are you nervous?

1121
01:08:30,878 --> 01:08:34,181
Every time. You
just get used to it.

1122
01:08:36,951 --> 01:08:41,022
If I'm being honest, I'm
most worried about you.

1123
01:08:43,423 --> 01:08:44,692
Me? Why me?

1124
01:08:46,561 --> 01:08:50,598
Well, to hear Dutch
and Lita talk in there,

1125
01:08:50,632 --> 01:08:53,200
there's no gate you
wouldn't storm, but,

1126
01:08:56,738 --> 01:08:58,806
you'll be all alone
to fight that monster.

1127
01:09:00,742 --> 01:09:02,142
I got Caleb in my corner.

1128
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:05,647
You know what I mean.

1129
01:09:08,549 --> 01:09:11,919
To be honest, I'm
never alone in there.

1130
01:09:13,487 --> 01:09:16,124
Maybe my first fight as a kid,

1131
01:09:16,156 --> 01:09:20,327
but after I lost to that
guy, he was with me up here.

1132
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:24,632
And then the next fighter
joined, then the next.

1133
01:09:25,667 --> 01:09:29,937
Win or lose, they all tell
me how to beat the next guy.

1134
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:35,009
I imagine it gets
pretty crowded in there.

1135
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:37,779
You can't never have
enough good ideas

1136
01:09:37,812 --> 01:09:38,980
going around in your head

1137
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:40,682
when those fists
start to flying.

1138
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,387
Ma'am, is this
fella bothering you?

1139
01:09:47,421 --> 01:09:49,957
Oh, no more than usual.

1140
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:53,393
Did I miss anything?

1141
01:09:53,427 --> 01:09:57,899
Ah, not really, they're
just discussing the details.

1142
01:09:57,932 --> 01:10:00,868
Ah, I'd better go play referee.

1143
01:10:01,703 --> 01:10:02,804
-Gentlemen.
-Ma'am.

1144
01:10:07,975 --> 01:10:09,010
Is it a good plan?

1145
01:10:12,847 --> 01:10:16,017
I would say it's south of good,

1146
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:17,284
but it's north of dying.

1147
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,287
Better than most, I guess.

1148
01:10:21,656 --> 01:10:22,990
But I like our chances.

1149
01:10:24,959 --> 01:10:25,993
Ever the gambler.

1150
01:10:27,628 --> 01:10:29,831
I just trusted my gut.

1151
01:10:29,864 --> 01:10:31,165
That's what led me to you.

1152
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:34,468
No, actually a
bulletin for a hot meal

1153
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:35,837
is what led you to me.

1154
01:10:38,172 --> 01:10:41,509
I was hungry, but
I trusted my gut.

1155
01:10:44,344 --> 01:10:47,148
You know, if it goes to hell
for either of us tomorrow,

1156
01:10:48,482 --> 01:10:52,720
I'd be proud to say I bit the
ground doing the right thing.

1157
01:10:56,423 --> 01:10:59,894
Well, here's to trusting our gut

1158
01:10:59,927 --> 01:11:01,261
and staying above snakes.

1159
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:05,833
Amen. Alright, pick a card.

1160
01:11:10,505 --> 01:11:13,574
Come on down! Come on down.

1161
01:11:13,608 --> 01:11:17,477
The prize fight of the
year is happening today!

1162
01:11:17,512 --> 01:11:21,516
The one champion of this
territory, the Waco Kid

1163
01:11:21,549 --> 01:11:25,653
is gonna make his triumphant
return to the ring!

1164
01:11:25,686 --> 01:11:27,088
And his opponent, woo!

1165
01:11:27,121 --> 01:11:30,925
That's the unbeatable,
unstoppable,

1166
01:11:32,126 --> 01:11:35,229
and yet undefeated
king of the ring,

1167
01:11:35,263 --> 01:11:38,465
our very own Killer
Connor Murphy!

1168
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:43,871
Get back here, you scram!

1169
01:11:43,905 --> 01:11:46,107
Gah! Third time today!

1170
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:58,418
Well, he definitely got
the crowds out for you.

1171
01:11:58,451 --> 01:12:00,087
Man's good at two things,

1172
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:02,824
making money and being
oilier than snake shit.

1173
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:07,595
Well, you got any last
nuggets of wisdom for me?

1174
01:12:08,461 --> 01:12:10,330
Wait, I know, I know.

1175
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:12,733
Don't overdo it.

1176
01:12:12,767 --> 01:12:13,668
Are you kidding me?

1177
01:12:14,735 --> 01:12:16,938
You seen that Clydesdale
you're fighting?

1178
01:12:16,971 --> 01:12:17,839
Yeah.

1179
01:12:17,872 --> 01:12:19,740
You overdo the hell out of it.

1180
01:12:25,112 --> 01:12:28,249
Yes, you're right,
good afternoon

1181
01:12:28,282 --> 01:12:30,151
and it's going to
be a good afternoon.

1182
01:12:30,184 --> 01:12:32,987
It's good to see
you on this fine day

1183
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:36,157
filled with first-rate
entertainment

1184
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:38,391
provided, I should acknowledge,

1185
01:12:38,425 --> 01:12:41,829
through the generosity
of Mr. Thaddeus Vincent.

1186
01:12:44,198 --> 01:12:47,001
Now, I know that we've got
a big prize fight coming up

1187
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:48,936
and so do you, but
that's coming up

1188
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:52,773
in just a little while
because the first bout

1189
01:12:52,807 --> 01:12:56,911
on today's match
will be this one,

1190
01:12:56,944 --> 01:13:02,382
featuring a young man whose
fists are as smooth as honey.

1191
01:13:02,984 --> 01:13:04,685
I'm talking about Sweetie Pete.

1192
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,022
Yeah!

1193
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:09,056
Yeah!

1194
01:13:10,324 --> 01:13:13,261
And in this corner,
his opponent.

1195
01:13:20,301 --> 01:13:23,204
Your man's in the prelims too?

1196
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:25,640
Well maybe ol' Sweetie
Pete will knock him out,

1197
01:13:25,673 --> 01:13:27,975
I'll win, won't even
have to throw a punch.

1198
01:13:28,009 --> 01:13:30,611
At least you can see
what you're up against.

1199
01:13:30,645 --> 01:13:33,047
Alright, fellas. Shake hands.

1200
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:37,752
And give me a head start.

1201
01:13:39,854 --> 01:13:41,222
Alright, fellas.

1202
01:13:42,857 --> 01:13:44,225
And, fight!

1203
01:13:59,173 --> 01:14:02,610
And the winner!

1204
01:14:27,068 --> 01:14:28,569
Looks like you have to
fight your own battles.

1205
01:14:28,602 --> 01:14:30,171
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

1206
01:14:30,204 --> 01:14:31,372
Me either.

1207
01:14:33,774 --> 01:14:35,843
Sorry I'm late, what did I miss?

1208
01:14:35,876 --> 01:14:38,112
Just a little glimpse
into my future.

1209
01:14:38,145 --> 01:14:39,046
What?

1210
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:40,614
Nothing.

1211
01:14:40,648 --> 01:14:42,016
Listen, I need you to make sure

1212
01:14:42,049 --> 01:14:43,651
you take care of this man, okay?

1213
01:14:44,919 --> 01:14:45,720
Alright.

1214
01:14:45,753 --> 01:14:46,620
Wait, wait, wait.

1215
01:14:47,588 --> 01:14:48,456
Hold this.

1216
01:14:48,488 --> 01:14:49,623
-Alright.
-And remember-

1217
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:50,558
I know.

1218
01:14:50,591 --> 01:14:52,460
I got it from
a girl in Texas.

1219
01:14:52,526 --> 01:14:54,061
-Yeah. Let's go.
-I got you.

1220
01:15:07,641 --> 01:15:10,811
-Here we go!
-Let's fight, alright!

1221
01:15:10,845 --> 01:15:11,679
Alright.

1222
01:15:13,014 --> 01:15:14,482
Hope you got right
with God, old man,

1223
01:15:14,515 --> 01:15:15,583
you ain't leaving this ring.

1224
01:15:15,616 --> 01:15:17,618
All I've heard is bark from you.

1225
01:15:17,651 --> 01:15:18,986
Let's see if you can bite.

1226
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,354
Why don't you save
it for the fight?

1227
01:15:20,388 --> 01:15:21,288
Ladies and gentlemen,

1228
01:15:21,322 --> 01:15:22,656
this is the moment
you've been waiting for

1229
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:25,326
for hardly any time at all.

1230
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:29,897
You've got yourself a couple
of real contenders here.

1231
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,633
Allow me to introduce
our challenger,

1232
01:15:32,666 --> 01:15:35,069
the Bare Knuckle Beast himself.

1233
01:15:35,102 --> 01:15:38,406
The man with fists like
a pair of six guns,

1234
01:15:38,439 --> 01:15:40,474
here to make a
wallop of a comeback.

1235
01:15:40,509 --> 01:15:43,844
We have the legend of
the frontier himself.

1236
01:15:43,878 --> 01:15:45,514
The Waco Kid.

1237
01:15:48,616 --> 01:15:50,151
I think your town likes me.

1238
01:15:52,353 --> 01:15:55,022
Okay, come on in, shake hands.

1239
01:15:56,157 --> 01:15:58,527
Now, show God you've
got some talent

1240
01:15:58,559 --> 01:16:00,361
before you go to meet him.

1241
01:16:00,394 --> 01:16:03,964
Alright, that's it,
and gimme a head start.

1242
01:16:13,974 --> 01:16:15,376
Fight!

1243
01:16:22,049 --> 01:16:24,585
Yeah! I'm faster than I look!

1244
01:16:46,006 --> 01:16:48,676
Psst, Dutch, over here.

1245
01:16:54,615 --> 01:16:56,150
There you are.

1246
01:16:56,183 --> 01:16:57,384
How's Waco?

1247
01:16:57,418 --> 01:16:59,687
He's fine. Fight just
started when I left.

1248
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:01,489
Don't you worry about him.

1249
01:17:01,523 --> 01:17:03,657
He can take care of himself.

1250
01:17:03,691 --> 01:17:05,594
How far is the mine from here?

1251
01:17:05,626 --> 01:17:07,027
Not far. Look.

1252
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:18,372
Boy, it sure would be
nice if those two fellas

1253
01:17:18,405 --> 01:17:20,341
were the only ones
I had to deal with.

1254
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:22,710
Safe to assume they're not.

1255
01:17:22,743 --> 01:17:24,745
Dutch, you think
you can handle them?

1256
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:29,049
Did Caleb say whether
or not these boys

1257
01:17:29,083 --> 01:17:31,018
know anything
about the children?

1258
01:17:31,051 --> 01:17:35,422
They know. There will likely
be more of them than usual.

1259
01:17:35,456 --> 01:17:38,692
Yeah, well, that ain't
gonna be a problem.

1260
01:17:38,726 --> 01:17:39,927
Good.

1261
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:41,462
We'll make our way
to the holding cell

1262
01:17:41,495 --> 01:17:43,364
and meet you back here
with the children.

1263
01:17:43,397 --> 01:17:44,732
Alright. Now listen.

1264
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,134
You two wait for my signal.

1265
01:17:47,168 --> 01:17:49,803
When you hear it,
you move, got it?

1266
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:50,671
Be careful.

1267
01:17:56,611 --> 01:17:58,345
The mine's closed, old man.

1268
01:18:00,848 --> 01:18:02,283
You boys might wanna get heeled.

1269
01:18:17,097 --> 01:18:17,932
Hey, hey!

1270
01:18:17,965 --> 01:18:19,601
Watch the corner!

1271
01:18:30,177 --> 01:18:31,613
Hey, hey, hey!

1272
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:41,488
The holdings should be over...

1273
01:18:54,235 --> 01:18:56,203
How is he still asleep?

1274
01:18:59,306 --> 01:19:01,308
You see the keys?

1275
01:19:01,342 --> 01:19:03,244
Ooh, how to get them?

1276
01:19:04,845 --> 01:19:06,715
Let's find a stick.

1277
01:19:06,747 --> 01:19:07,748
Good idea!

1278
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:19,561
Keep your eyes out!

1279
01:19:22,096 --> 01:19:23,163
He's over here!

1280
01:19:41,415 --> 01:19:42,751
Where'd he go?

1281
01:20:02,771 --> 01:20:04,271
Oh!

1282
01:20:04,305 --> 01:20:08,976
I must say, I have gotten
quite handy with these.

1283
01:20:11,078 --> 01:20:13,748
That's not quite what
I meant by stick.

1284
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:16,383
Oh.

1285
01:20:39,273 --> 01:20:41,609
You seen that Dutch fella
around here anywhere?

1286
01:20:42,843 --> 01:20:45,814
I'm just watching the
fight, same as you.

1287
01:20:48,315 --> 01:20:52,821
Let me guess, you have
absolutely no idea

1288
01:20:52,853 --> 01:20:54,455
where he coulda gotten off to.

1289
01:20:56,023 --> 01:20:56,825
Nope.

1290
01:21:01,763 --> 01:21:03,430
You have no spine.

1291
01:21:53,013 --> 01:21:55,149
Miss Rosemary, you came!

1292
01:21:58,553 --> 01:22:00,020
Of course I did.

1293
01:22:43,798 --> 01:22:45,567
Get to your corner.

1294
01:22:51,238 --> 01:22:52,473
Get off of him!

1295
01:22:55,476 --> 01:22:57,478
Come on, get off of him!

1296
01:23:07,387 --> 01:23:08,388
Now, let us hurry.

1297
01:23:09,824 --> 01:23:11,492
We haven't much time to spare.

1298
01:23:26,841 --> 01:23:30,812
Everyone, my name is
Rosemary and this is Lita.

1299
01:23:30,845 --> 01:23:34,616
You'll need to do everything
exactly as we say, alright?

1300
01:23:34,649 --> 01:23:36,049
Keep your heads down.

1301
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:38,418
We'll be moving very quickly
and we're not stopping

1302
01:23:38,452 --> 01:23:40,087
until we reach
the train station.

1303
01:23:41,488 --> 01:23:45,459
Let's go, be quick
and quiet as you can.

1304
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:21,829
Alright,
get outta here. Get!

1305
01:24:23,898 --> 01:24:25,132
-Get up, Waco!
-Is he okay?

1306
01:24:25,165 --> 01:24:26,366
-Is he alright?
-He's fine!

1307
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:31,839
I think you almost had him.

1308
01:24:31,873 --> 01:24:34,008
I feel like I'm hitting
the broad side of a steer.

1309
01:24:34,042 --> 01:24:34,842
His ribs?

1310
01:24:34,876 --> 01:24:36,310
No, his jaw.

1311
01:24:36,343 --> 01:24:38,145
He's not slowing down either.

1312
01:24:38,178 --> 01:24:42,050
But I, I don't think I can
last too many more rounds.

1313
01:24:42,082 --> 01:24:43,585
Have you seen anything fishy?

1314
01:24:45,252 --> 01:24:47,655
I saw the the deputy head off.

1315
01:24:47,689 --> 01:24:49,557
You think he's
headed to the mines?

1316
01:24:49,591 --> 01:24:52,727
I dunno, but Dutch can
take care of himself.

1317
01:25:04,005 --> 01:25:06,641
Hey! Whoa!

1318
01:25:06,674 --> 01:25:09,711
Depu, oh!

1319
01:25:09,744 --> 01:25:12,013
-Back off me!
-Sorry, you were crowding me.

1320
01:25:12,046 --> 01:25:15,182
Deputy said you'd
be here.

1321
01:25:17,117 --> 01:25:17,952
What?

1322
01:25:24,792 --> 01:25:25,627
Kids okay?

1323
01:25:28,295 --> 01:25:30,230
Good. Good job, ladies.

1324
01:25:30,263 --> 01:25:31,633
Was that the last of them?

1325
01:25:32,634 --> 01:25:33,568
Yeah, I reckon so.

1326
01:25:33,601 --> 01:25:36,104
Should be smooth sailing
from here on out.

1327
01:25:36,136 --> 01:25:36,971
Follow me.

1328
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,244
Yoohoo!

1329
01:25:45,079 --> 01:25:47,048
Hello, boys and girls.

1330
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:49,383
You ready to meet your parents?

1331
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:54,421
Your uncle Zeke's been dying
to shoot this thing.

1332
01:25:57,157 --> 01:25:58,893
You're supposed to duck.

1333
01:25:58,926 --> 01:26:00,128
Run!

1334
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,863
Here she comes, Dutch!

1335
01:26:10,905 --> 01:26:13,407
What in the hell was that?

1336
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:16,077
Somebody trusted that
idiot with a Gatling gun.

1337
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:17,712
How are we supposed
to get out of this?

1338
01:26:17,745 --> 01:26:20,815
You can hide behind that rock
all you want, you coward!

1339
01:26:20,848 --> 01:26:24,752
I got enough ammo and grit to
blast a hole clean through ya.

1340
01:26:26,654 --> 01:26:28,422
There are two ways back to town.

1341
01:26:28,455 --> 01:26:30,758
I want you to take
the kids the long way.

1342
01:26:30,792 --> 01:26:32,560
I'll keep his head down.

1343
01:26:32,593 --> 01:26:33,427
Pardon me.

1344
01:26:49,977 --> 01:26:51,979
We can't just leave you here!

1345
01:26:52,013 --> 01:26:53,581
You have to.

1346
01:26:53,614 --> 01:26:54,949
You said it yourself,

1347
01:26:54,982 --> 01:26:56,984
these kids are the
most important thing.

1348
01:26:58,786 --> 01:27:02,389
Now, I want you to wait
for my signal and just run.

1349
01:27:03,958 --> 01:27:06,961
Alright, children. Get ready.

1350
01:27:11,632 --> 01:27:14,802
Ready?

1351
01:27:14,836 --> 01:27:15,770
Go!

1352
01:27:15,803 --> 01:27:20,808
Go, go!

1353
01:27:28,015 --> 01:27:29,851
Ha.

1354
01:27:29,884 --> 01:27:34,822
I got the boy, I see ya.

1355
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:49,003
You died out there in
that desert, Dutch!

1356
01:27:49,036 --> 01:27:53,340
You died the minute you crossed
the infamous Zeke Tyler!

1357
01:27:55,009 --> 01:27:57,011
Where are you? I got ya.

1358
01:28:57,805 --> 01:29:02,610
Get up, Waco! No!

1359
01:30:45,947 --> 01:30:47,748
Son of a bitch.

1360
01:30:58,793 --> 01:31:00,094
Winner!

1361
01:31:03,798 --> 01:31:04,765
The winner!

1362
01:31:07,768 --> 01:31:08,769
Shoot him.

1363
01:31:21,315 --> 01:31:22,616
Yeah! Waco.

1364
01:31:50,177 --> 01:31:52,313
No, no! Get to the kids!

1365
01:32:15,503 --> 01:32:16,437
Waco!

1366
01:32:18,172 --> 01:32:20,141
I'm afraid I'm all you get.

1367
01:32:21,675 --> 01:32:24,678
Your friend's as good
as worm food already.

1368
01:32:28,115 --> 01:32:32,386
I'd be more than happy to
arrange a reunion if you'd like.

1369
01:32:35,656 --> 01:32:36,724
Damn shame.

1370
01:32:38,359 --> 01:32:40,561
Old Cowsbane Morales,

1371
01:32:41,896 --> 01:32:46,901
taken out by a no-good bounty
hunter the likes of you.

1372
01:32:49,403 --> 01:32:53,274
That boy rode with
me for a long time

1373
01:32:53,307 --> 01:32:55,342
before I picked up this badge.

1374
01:32:58,646 --> 01:33:00,347
Taught the boy
everything he knew.

1375
01:33:04,185 --> 01:33:07,988
Always figured I'd have to test
myself against him one day.

1376
01:33:11,592 --> 01:33:13,427
But I reckon you'll have to do.

1377
01:33:16,363 --> 01:33:17,164
You ready?

1378
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,401
You gonna let me
check this pistol?

1379
01:33:20,434 --> 01:33:21,735
Make sure I got bullets?

1380
01:33:24,605 --> 01:33:27,675
Well, now that's another
real goddamn shame, ain't it?

1381
01:33:31,779 --> 01:33:33,881
We go when this hits the ground.

1382
01:33:43,023 --> 01:33:44,225
Don't overdo it.

1383
01:33:44,258 --> 01:33:44,992
Huh?

1384
01:34:00,207 --> 01:34:03,477
Now I see why Waco
likes to do that.

1385
01:34:05,045 --> 01:34:05,846
What'd I miss?

1386
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:07,047
Your cue.

1387
01:34:07,081 --> 01:34:09,216
I'm sorry. People kept
trying to kill me.

1388
01:34:10,251 --> 01:34:12,119
What about the
children? Are they safe?

1389
01:34:12,153 --> 01:34:12,953
They are.

1390
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:17,324
Well hell, we about
actually saved the day.

1391
01:34:19,393 --> 01:34:20,294
Dutch?

1392
01:34:20,327 --> 01:34:21,162
I'm empty.

1393
01:34:22,296 --> 01:34:23,264
How hard?

1394
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:27,935
How hard is it for
you nimpent, jasper,

1395
01:34:27,968 --> 01:34:31,472
vagrant sons of
bitches to understand?

1396
01:34:31,505 --> 01:34:32,439
What's that mean?

1397
01:34:32,473 --> 01:34:33,707
I have no idea.

1398
01:34:33,741 --> 01:34:35,577
Well, it's, I'll explain later.

1399
01:34:36,645 --> 01:34:38,513
I am civilization!

1400
01:34:41,849 --> 01:34:44,151
I have put too many of
you into the ground!

1401
01:34:45,654 --> 01:34:46,687
What's three more?

1402
01:35:10,144 --> 01:35:11,045
Nice shot, kid.

1403
01:35:39,473 --> 01:35:42,042
Think this is enough to
cover Morales' bounty?

1404
01:35:45,012 --> 01:35:46,681
That's more than enough.

1405
01:35:46,715 --> 01:35:47,881
I'd say that'll do.

1406
01:35:48,882 --> 01:35:50,117
But are you sure the
folks around here

1407
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:53,053
ain't gonna need this to help
y'all get back on your feet?

1408
01:35:55,089 --> 01:35:59,561
No, senores, you freed
this town from debt.

1409
01:35:59,594 --> 01:36:02,796
We get to keep all that we
have and all that we earn

1410
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:04,599
and we'll never
forget you for that.

1411
01:36:08,202 --> 01:36:10,337
It was an honor working
with both of you.

1412
01:36:10,371 --> 01:36:11,740
You too, Caleb.

1413
01:36:11,772 --> 01:36:14,542
-Ah!
-Oh, you.

1414
01:36:16,443 --> 01:36:17,612
Hasta luego.

1415
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:23,951
How're we supposed
to carry this?

1416
01:36:24,952 --> 01:36:26,453
Maybe they'll let us
keep the wheelbarrow.

1417
01:36:28,389 --> 01:36:30,592
How're we gonna pull a
wheelbarrow with our horses?

1418
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:32,793
Seems as you boys can
afford a wagon now.

1419
01:36:39,734 --> 01:36:41,302
Dutch, Waco.

1420
01:36:43,638 --> 01:36:48,409
I just came to say goodbye
and to thank you both.

1421
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:51,478
We did a good
thing in this town.

1422
01:36:53,047 --> 01:36:56,450
Because of you both, we've
saved children's lives.

1423
01:36:56,483 --> 01:36:57,686
Oh, stop it.

1424
01:36:57,719 --> 01:36:59,887
People are gonna think
we're going soft.

1425
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:00,789
Or tenderized.

1426
01:37:06,994 --> 01:37:09,396
Look, we just did
what was right.

1427
01:37:09,430 --> 01:37:11,800
You know, if enough
of that goes around,

1428
01:37:11,832 --> 01:37:13,500
might be a good
country after all.

1429
01:37:14,935 --> 01:37:16,671
So, what's next for you?

1430
01:37:17,838 --> 01:37:22,142
Well, I must say I have
been a bit inspired.

1431
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,745
Not that I didn't
expect adventure,

1432
01:37:23,778 --> 01:37:28,315
but this little journey
has excited me to my cause.

1433
01:37:28,349 --> 01:37:29,917
There are still plenty
of children to find

1434
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:31,151
in plenty of towns,

1435
01:37:31,185 --> 01:37:34,689
so I am catching a train
to Oklahoma tomorrow.

1436
01:37:35,657 --> 01:37:39,728
And who knows, maybe our
paths will cross again.

1437
01:37:39,761 --> 01:37:40,829
Well, I hope so.

1438
01:37:40,861 --> 01:37:43,130
Me too, Miss Rosemary.

1439
01:37:49,804 --> 01:37:53,140
Dutch, I feel like we
did a whole lot of good.

1440
01:37:54,341 --> 01:37:59,012
Almost like, almost like
we're lawmen ourselves.

1441
01:37:59,046 --> 01:38:00,314
Yeah, maybe.

1442
01:38:00,347 --> 01:38:02,015
And who knows, maybe
this place will become

1443
01:38:02,049 --> 01:38:04,485
the safe, sleepy little town

1444
01:38:04,519 --> 01:38:06,353
the deputy said it was gonna be.

1445
01:38:06,387 --> 01:38:11,392
Yep. I imagine the next
sheriff won't have any trouble.

1446
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,495
Alright, enough chit-chat.

1447
01:38:14,529 --> 01:38:17,097
Let's find some bags
to put in this...

1448
01:38:17,131 --> 01:38:18,867
-What happened to our gold?
-What?

1449
01:38:20,869 --> 01:38:22,202
Son of a!

1450
01:38:58,172 --> 01:38:59,607
Langford take three.

1451
01:39:00,441 --> 01:39:02,911
Ow!

1452
01:39:02,943 --> 01:39:04,779
Don't come
out, they'll shoot!

1453
01:39:07,948 --> 01:39:09,216
Reset, Caleb
had a problem there.

1454
01:39:09,249 --> 01:39:11,920
Alright, so Caleb's
mess up was way worse.

1455
01:39:11,952 --> 01:39:13,655
Yeah, it was.

1456
01:39:13,688 --> 01:39:16,825
I blew it, man, I'm so sorry.

1457
01:39:16,858 --> 01:39:18,492
Cut.

1458
01:39:18,526 --> 01:39:21,328
I was just dreaming
about this girl

1459
01:39:21,361 --> 01:39:22,664
I know down in Saltillo.

1460
01:39:22,697 --> 01:39:25,199
She can do things
with her one good arm

1461
01:39:25,232 --> 01:39:29,269
that'd make you forget
about that harelip.

1462
01:39:29,303 --> 01:39:31,940
This is the wordiest bit.

1463
01:39:31,972 --> 01:39:33,373
Still rolling.

1464
01:39:33,407 --> 01:39:35,543
Five, acting
chops, take one.

1465
01:39:37,579 --> 01:39:38,780
-Actors' chops!
-Alright.

1466
01:39:38,813 --> 01:39:40,715
10, Hubert, take one.

1467
01:39:40,748 --> 01:39:43,818
Hubert. Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

1468
01:39:46,487 --> 01:39:49,423
Let's wait for that.

1469
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:55,964
Yes. Incomposed,
that's right, and.

1470
01:39:56,029 --> 01:39:58,098
I told you once,
you son of a bitch,

1471
01:39:58,131 --> 01:39:59,667
I'm the best there's ever been.

1472
01:40:01,502 --> 01:40:04,739
We need to uphold the
laws in this town.

1473
01:40:06,674 --> 01:40:07,976
If for no other reason,

1474
01:40:09,409 --> 01:40:11,144
do it for the beeping that
you hear in the background.

1475
01:40:11,178 --> 01:40:12,312
I would agree.

1476
01:40:12,346 --> 01:40:13,982
Can I have my gun back, please?

1477
01:40:17,351 --> 01:40:18,953
That's just reckless.

1478
01:40:18,987 --> 01:40:20,254
What if he wakes up at midnight,

1479
01:40:20,287 --> 01:40:21,488
he wants a glass of warm milk,

1480
01:40:21,523 --> 01:40:22,824
he comes in here,
steps on a bullet,

1481
01:40:22,857 --> 01:40:24,491
he's gonna blame me,
but it's your fault.

1482
01:40:24,526 --> 01:40:25,827
Just remember that.

1483
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:28,095
Symbolized
by bloods and so on

1484
01:40:28,128 --> 01:40:30,932
is to destroy the Christ idea.

1485
01:40:30,965 --> 01:40:31,633
Heather, stop reading,

1486
01:40:31,966 --> 01:40:32,967
you're gonna summon
a demon or something.

1487
01:40:33,001 --> 01:40:34,167
Alright, here we go.

1488
01:40:38,806 --> 01:40:40,575
Love letters from a
concerned citizen.

1489
01:40:40,608 --> 01:40:41,809
Oh, there's this
girl in Abilene,

1490
01:40:41,843 --> 01:40:43,545
she used to write
me twice a week!

1491
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:46,681
Cut.

1492
01:40:46,714 --> 01:40:48,315
But I know
where the children are.

1493
01:40:48,348 --> 01:40:50,284
What?

1494
01:40:51,619 --> 01:40:53,186
-Let's reset.
-You do,

1495
01:40:53,220 --> 01:40:54,454
I always forget the.

1496
01:40:55,455 --> 01:40:56,323
Let's hold for a second,

1497
01:40:56,356 --> 01:40:57,592
we'll wait for the
worst of that plane.

1498
01:40:57,625 --> 01:40:59,027
You mother.

1499
01:40:59,059 --> 01:41:00,028
Wah.

1500
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:01,495
That was good, we
got both of those lines.

1501
01:41:01,529 --> 01:41:03,031
They're provided for...

1502
01:41:06,166 --> 01:41:07,569
Sorry.

1503
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:11,104
You went a lot
longer the last time.

1504
01:41:11,138 --> 01:41:12,740
Let's reset from the top.

1505
01:41:13,741 --> 01:41:14,976
Actually, no.

1506
01:41:19,212 --> 01:41:21,181
Bulletin.

1507
01:41:21,214 --> 01:41:23,150
No, actually a
bulletin for a hot meal

1508
01:41:23,183 --> 01:41:24,117
is what led you to me.

1509
01:41:24,151 --> 01:41:25,587
And hold for a second.

1510
01:41:26,988 --> 01:41:29,657
My gut, I'm telling
you, David, I'm on point.

1511
01:41:29,691 --> 01:41:31,391
We go when this hits the ground.

1512
01:41:38,231 --> 01:41:39,466
You dropped the coin.

1513
01:41:39,499 --> 01:41:41,703
Scene 28, evil, take three.

1514
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:43,705
Calling me evil?

1515
01:41:44,772 --> 01:41:46,874
-Camera set.
-That's just rude.

1516
01:41:46,908 --> 01:41:48,241
Hello.

1517
01:41:48,275 --> 01:41:49,510
Hello, Katie.

1518
01:41:49,544 --> 01:41:51,679
Katie.

1519
01:41:51,713 --> 01:41:55,717
Resetting, resetting.

1520
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:59,020
The cowardice of some
men, it saddens me.

1521
01:41:59,053 --> 01:42:00,755
I completely did that backwards.

1522
01:42:00,788 --> 01:42:02,422
The gold.

1523
01:42:02,456 --> 01:42:03,658
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

1524
01:42:03,691 --> 01:42:05,258
You wanna take it from the top?

1525
01:42:05,292 --> 01:42:06,694
I said it backwards!

1526
01:42:06,728 --> 01:42:09,764
And that entertainment
is provided

1527
01:42:09,797 --> 01:42:11,933
by a very special host,

1528
01:42:11,966 --> 01:42:16,771
and I'm talking about our
friend Francois Parsouneman.

1529
01:42:19,874 --> 01:42:20,875
-No.
-Let's hold rotate.

1530
01:42:20,908 --> 01:42:22,309
It's Thaddeus Vincent.

1531
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:27,048
I couldn't
remember his name.

1532
01:42:29,917 --> 01:42:31,184
Now listen here, you mother-

1533
01:42:31,218 --> 01:42:33,453
Hello, boys and girls!

1534
01:42:33,487 --> 01:42:35,757
You ready to meet your parents?

1535
01:42:35,790 --> 01:42:39,994
Your Uncle Zeke's been
dying, nope, nope, nope.

1536
01:42:41,062 --> 01:42:42,396
Your Uncle Zeke's...

1537
01:42:43,665 --> 01:42:44,666
Let's reset.

1538
01:42:46,801 --> 01:42:48,468
-Argh!
-That's okay.

1539
01:42:48,502 --> 01:42:49,971
-Speed.
-Speed.

1540
01:42:50,004 --> 01:42:52,807
35, direction after slate
was called, take three.

1541
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:53,841
-Oh!
-What?

1542
01:42:55,242 --> 01:42:56,644
No live fire?

1543
01:42:56,678 --> 01:42:59,013
No live fire, I'm just
shouting bang like an asshole.
