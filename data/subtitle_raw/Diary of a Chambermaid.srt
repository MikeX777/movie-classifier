1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
25.000

2
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,033
Excuse me.

3
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,997
- Are you from the Lanlaire's?
- You the new chambermaid?

4
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,082
Let me see you references

5
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,273
Let me see your hands?

6
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,823
You're the scullery maid?

7
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,580
There's a train leaving for Paris
in twenty minutes, take it.

8
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,668
- But, I don't have money
- That's your business

9
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:33,129
Besides, a girl with your looks,
well, it'll be too much

10
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:39,552
I'm sorry sir, but it's not my fault
I'll work for less, I'll do anything.

11
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,599
- What else can I do?
- Come on, you!

12
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,728
Just a moment
Are you Mr. Lanlaire?

13
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,855
I run the Lanlaire's establishment.

14
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,982
I know what you are
you are the valet.

15
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,237
I am the valet, among other things.

16
00:03:57,404 --> 00:04:00,407
You are the valet, and that's all
And don't put on airs with me.

17
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,119
And you can just go tell
whoever it is you work for...

18
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,622
that because you didn't like her,
the chambermaid's is quitting too.

19
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,417
That's all, you may go

20
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,298
- You shouldn't have done it for me
- I didn't

21
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,386
My, but you are brave
I wish I was brave like that

22
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,931
I wish I were too. I've never
talked like that in my life.

23
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,809
And stop crying, stupid
we can cry all the way back to Paris

24
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,102
Wait a minute!

25
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,939
I changed my mind
Get in both of you

26
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,817
Both?

27
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,071
Oh! Get my things.

28
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,247
- He must be a very important man
- He's a valet

29
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,083
- No, no, no...
- No, no, no...

30
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,925
- What's your name?
- Louise

31
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,595
- And what's yours?
- Joseph

32
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,723
My name's Celestine,
in case anybody's interested.

33
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,099
I see

34
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,022
- Are you sure he's only a valet?
- He's an undertaker

35
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,484
What I know about
valets would fill my diary.

36
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,700
Here's your room.

37
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,287
- For both of us?
- Yes

38
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:16,084
- There's only one bed
- I'll sleep on the floor

39
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,087
Stop shrugging!
Bring another bed.

40
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,682
I don't ever want to see
you shrug your shoulders again.

41
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,936
- You never do it!
- It's what I've done all my life.

42
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,566
Do this, do that,
bring me this, bring me that...

43
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,526
you eat too much sugar,
are you clean?

44
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:43,570
- I'm sick of it!
- Yes!

45
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,324
You don't know it, but
you've changed my whole life.

46
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:53,079
When I saw you at the station
I understood what was wrong with me.

47
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,998
All of a sudden I understood.

48
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,004
Life is life. From now on
I'm going to fight hard...

49
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,381
and I don't care who
gets hurt just so it's not me.

50
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,136
I'm not going to be a
chambermaid any longer. No, I'm not.

51
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:12,223
I'm going to be a mistress
and have a house of my own.

52
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:13,933
Oh! Excuse me!

53
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,775
And I'm going to grab the first man
I meet and get where I'm going.

54
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:26,154
I don't care if he's handsome
or ugly, or young, or old...

55
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,366
just so he's got money,
that's the main thing, money.

56
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,533
Yes

57
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:38,166
They've always hurt me,
so from now on, I'm going to use them.

58
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,337
No more love for Celestine

59
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,924
I'm going to write that down
so I'll never, never forget it.

60
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,440
I hope you like to work.

61
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,317
Hard work keeps you out of mischief.

62
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,111
What kind of mischief
could you get into?

63
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,906
Having 6 or 7 gentlemen friends
after me at the same time...

64
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,284
fighting over me. That's enough
mischief for anybody, isn't it?

65
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,995
Clean the sink,
that'll keep you busy for a while

66
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,580
Eggs!

67
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,714
- New?
- Yes

68
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,718
Are you from the village?
Do you have a good time here?

69
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,472
You'll be seeing us the
first afternoon we have off.

70
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,225
- What's your name?
- His name's Pierre

71
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,227
Run along now, we're busy.

72
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,774
- He's nice
- Where's the other one?

73
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,403
- Celestine? She's coming
- She get into mischief, too?

74
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,490
She's my closest friend
We get into mischief together.

75
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,412
Oh! Mr. Lanlaire!
Did you have a good hunt sir?

76
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,750
I don't like the kill
I never carry cartridges.

77
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,878
Up, up, there's a good dog.

78
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,631
I hunt to walk,
to get away from this house.

79
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,675
I had them hidden for you, Sir.

80
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,135
Ouch! Hot!

81
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,599
Is it good?

82
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,021
Went down the wrong way. Thank you.

83
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:28,818
Would you like a nice bottle
of cold cider to wash it down?

84
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,915
I'm Celestine, the new maid
I'm starving, would you give some?

85
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,420
What do you do around here?
I know, you're the gardener.

86
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,381
My, they're hot

87
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,885
- What's this place like to work in?
- If I knew another one, I'd go to it.

88
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,888
- They let you wear a beard?
- That's about all.

89
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,475
That Joseph's kind of bossy, isn't he?
He's not going to boss me around.

90
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:05,480
I've found out
it pays to be very tough

91
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:09,150
That maybe all right for you
but it doesn't seem to do for me.

92
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,611
Stick with me
and you'll be on the right track...

93
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,405
We'll put the masters in their places

94
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,285
Sit down! Huh?

95
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:27,127
- Charles, what are you doing here?
- Sorry, my dear...

96
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:34,759
This is the last time I'll warn
you not feed him between meals

97
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,887
- You're the new scullery maid?
- Yes, Madame.

98
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,889
- Your name?
- Louise, Madame

99
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,349
That's very proper

100
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:48,106
- And you're the chambermaid
- Yes, Madame

101
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,983
- Your name, please
- Celestine

102
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,029
- That's too complicated
I'll call you Marie

103
00:10:55,405 --> 00:11:00,785
- I prefer to be called by my name
- Interesting. Turn around, please.

104
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,247
- Turn around?
- That's what I said.

105
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,754
Yes, I like your figure.
We'll modify your clothes.

106
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,883
Joseph, they'll help with the dinner
and retire immediately afterward.

107
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,594
They will arise at five o'clock
and being their duties.

108
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,013
Now come to my room,
I want to talk to you.

109
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:31,066
Stupid! Oh! I'm sorry.

110
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:10,582
- Who lives in these rooms here?
- That's of no interest to you.

111
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:14,002
I'll find out. You're not the only
source of information in this house.

112
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,503
I'm the most reliable

113
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:19,591
- Is it haunted or something?
No, but it will be.

114
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,927
If you want to see something
worthwhile, come with me.

115
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,597
- Now?
- Now.

116
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,739
Aside from Madame, I'm the only one
who has a key to this vault.

117
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:51,122
Upstairs, it's haunted?

118
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,999
What's this?
The torture chamber?

119
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:59,047
Oh! My goodness!
It must be worth than a million.

120
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,675
It's worth more than chateau
and the grounds put together.

121
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,928
They are antiques,
symbols aristocracy.

122
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,806
- Do they use these every day?
- Only once a year.

123
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,850
- On midnight of July 14th.
- To celebrate our freedom.

124
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:14,688
In this family, July 14th
means the day of France doom.

125
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,733
- Don't they like the Republic?
No, neither do I.

126
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,694
Republic was created for weaklings.

127
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,530
I see, I see.

128
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,828
Look at this one,
It's got rubies and diamonds in it.

129
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,748
It's a snuffbox.
Very valuable.

130
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,002
- Do you think they'd miss it?
- Go back to work!

131
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:17,709
Hello! I'm sorry about yesterday,
I should have known you're the master.

132
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,754
Forgive me, please, and
thank you so much for being nice.

133
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,883
Don't go! You know
you're a very pretty girl.

134
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:29,763
- I hope you'll like it there
- With you're help, I'll try, sir.

135
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,266
- Course it isn't like Paris, is it?
- It's quite different.

136
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,519
I'll bet you had a gay
time in Paris, didn't you?

137
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,646
Mr. Lanlaire, really?

138
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:43,985
I'd like to bring a little of Paris
here. I'd like a gay time, myself.

139
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:48,031
Perhaps we could go to
Paris sometime, couldn't we?

140
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,991
You're just like
all the other gentlemen...

141
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,410
and I so thought
that you would be different.

142
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:57,957
Celestine, don't be angry
Will you do me the favor...

143
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:04,297
to buy yourself a little gift,
a token of my esteem?

144
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,717
Will you accept this franc?

145
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,888
You're sweet, sir
I can't take your money.

146
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,683
I'd rather have some
sort of remembrance...

147
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,769
something that belongs to you,
like an old snuffbox, maybe.

148
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:21,815
- An snuffbox, like the?
- Yes, something yours.

149
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,025
- The one with rubies and diamonds?
- Yes!

150
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,236
- For heaven's sake!
- Mojuet!

151
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,825
Breaking my glass again?

152
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:36,579
One, two, three!
Mojuet. I'll kill you!

153
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,293
I'll kill you Mojuet!

154
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,297
Come out!

155
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:52,762
Come out, you coward!
I tell you, come out!

156
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,652
Here, you mosquito!
Where are you?

157
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,242
I'll get my gun.

158
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,792
Excuse me.

159
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,129
Captain Mojuet.
I'm your neighbor.

160
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:29,924
I'm an old soldier. As ready
to serve a woman as my country.

161
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:33,011
Captain, if it isn't asking too much,
why are you breaking the glasses?

162
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:36,973
Tactics, my dear, to get Lanlaire
away, so I could talk to you.

163
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,268
- Couldn't you talk, if he where here?
- No, we're enemies

164
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,979
The Lanlaires are reactionaries
and I'm a liberal

165
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,857
They critized me publicly for
eating at the same table with Rose.

166
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:49,486
She's my servant. There's nothing
wrong with eating with Rose.

167
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,780
- I should say no!
- Yes, I told them.

168
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,908
Excuse me. This one.

169
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,952
- For heaven's sake!
- Delicious!

170
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,455
- Why do you eat them?
- I eat everything.

171
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,374
I've eaten every kind
of flower in the garden

172
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,919
Some of them are delicious

173
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:10,048
Some of them, don't amount to much
These are very bad.

174
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,551
Very interesting, but here
comes Mr. Lanlaire with a shotgun.

175
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,763
I'm no a coward
my dossier proves that.

176
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,890
I'm famous over the entire district.

177
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,684
I'm afraid of nothing and anybody.

178
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,020
- Mojuet I'll kill you!
- I eat anything, dead or alive.

179
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,106
- I don't care if I'm hungry
When people find something...

180
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:30,985
the first thing they do is to bring
it to me and I eat it.

181
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,156
Get off my roses!

182
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,451
No, no!

183
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:44,207
You go away!
You go out of the way!

184
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:48,461
Let me be alone!

185
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:54,718
You great big bully!

186
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,596
- Let my baby alone
- Madame! He attacked my garden!

187
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,579
Ordinarily we never enter
these rooms. However since they...

188
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:27,792
maybe occupied shortly,
we're going to clean them today.

189
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,003
Joseph, open the door, please.

190
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:43,433
Louise, shine those shoes.
Celestine, take those clothes...

191
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,019
and brush them carefully. I do hope
the moths haven't got into it.

192
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,939
Joseph come with me. I'll pick out
the curtains you are to hang.

193
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,139
I was thinking of you
last night and today.

194
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:25,392
I've been thinking of you too, sir.

195
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,020
- You know, that snuffbox...
- You must forget I mentioned it.

196
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:33,525
Not at all. It takes time,
that's all. Are you getting...

197
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:38,571
accustomed to the house?
- I'm getting to like it very much.

198
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,490
Good, you must excuse me.

199
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:47,205
Who do all those things belong to?
What's the mystery?

200
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,958
You'll find out in time,
don't be curious.

201
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,794
I don't know why
I expected you tell me anything.

202
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:58,008
I'll tell you, the Master has nothing
except his birth certificate.

203
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:02,387
- Not even a snuffbox.
- You know a lot about me, don't you?

204
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:07,600
- Yes, you'll learn I'm your friend.
- I doubt that.

205
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:18,570
- I was saying when we were interrupted.
- I'm sorry, I have to do my work.

206
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,531
I'm making plans
about that snuffbox.

207
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,743
I think Madame works you too hard.

208
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,455
Perhaps you will insist
that Madame give me more time...

209
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,497
so that you and I
can go to Paris together.

210
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,875
- Have I done something wrong?
- Oh! Not at all.

211
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,251
Hello, in there?

212
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,088
Lanlaire, come out!
Come out!

213
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:40,050
Wherever you are,
Come out and fight.

214
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:43,678
You let him talk like that?
Don't you accept his challenge?

215
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:47,390
Accept his challenge?
Certainly, I will!

216
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,643
- Mojuet wait for me!
- That's what fools do!

217
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,608
Well, that settles that!

218
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:59,027
- Why?
- He hasn't got a cent

219
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,904
Now, what are you going to do?

220
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,165
After all
the Captain's not so bad.

221
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,669
- Celestine! Come over to my house!

222
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,630
Come away from that old man!

223
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:27,138
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

224
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,974
- Yes Captain.
- You take too long.

225
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,311
You never learn to fix that.

226
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:35,271
I don't want to learn,
It's bad for you.

227
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:37,273
Just been quiet!
Hurry up!

228
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,486
- Captain!
- Celestine!

229
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,947
- Hi Captain!
- Celestine!

230
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,742
You asked me
to come to visit you.

231
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:51,371
My, what a distinguished
looking estate you have.

232
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:52,914
Distinguished?
You think so?

233
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,542
Definitely. But then, you're
a distinguished type yourself...

234
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:59,421
- See the roses
- I thought you have eaten them.

235
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:00,588
No, wait.

236
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,299
I switched to water lilies.

237
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,886
Such fascinating thing you eat.
That's right.

238
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,974
Do you know that rarely do you
meet a man of the world as you...

239
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:12,892
in this dull countryside.

240
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,228
No, I'm just and
old village bumpkin.

241
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:18,023
- Don't you believe him.
- No false modesty.

242
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,859
- He's my baby boy, Celestine.
- Quiet! Quiet!

243
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,444
- Would you have a drink?
- No, thank you.

244
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,070
- I would
- Not too much, Captain.

245
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:27,073
- You run along and start dinner
- Very well, I will.

246
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:30,035
I get on my baby's
nerves lately it's my asthma...

247
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:32,954
But he couldn't get along without
his mommy, could you, Captain?

248
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:37,334
- You run along I said
- But don't you get in a mischief.

249
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,172
No mischief,
No mischief!

250
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:44,632
Listen to her, like a locomotive
What are we talking about?

251
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,843
- Your diet
- That's right!

252
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,803
Sit down, let me explain.

253
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:52,140
Everybody in the world, except me
gets into a root about food.

254
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,059
They have no pioneer instincts.

255
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:57,937
The first man who ate an oyster,
people call him crazy or sinful.

256
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,273
- That's right!
- Right! The same with me.

257
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,526
I've discovered new food
that nobody ever heard of before.

258
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:07,155
I'm going to eat absolutely anything.
Keeps me young and vigorous.

259
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:11,159
If you were in Paris,
they write a book about you.

260
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,952
No, I was in Paris
Nobody wrote a book about me.

261
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,455
You just didn't know
the right authors.

262
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:18,792
Tell me more,
You eat stones too?

263
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,712
No, stones have no taste.
You don't get the idea.

264
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,341
Let me show you what I do
with stones. Now, see that?

265
00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:28,510
Now listen.

266
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:31,096
See, what I do with the stones?

267
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,014
You're the cleverest
man I ever saw.

268
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,683
Have a good time anyway!

269
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:39,896
I'll show you something else.

270
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:43,817
This is Davey.

271
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:47,821
General Davey, he's the best
friend I have in the world.

272
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:51,116
- Darling, he looks like you!
- Thank you

273
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,494
- Does he eat everything too?
- Not as many things as I do.

274
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,539
Nice little play bear Lanlaire's
haven't got anything as nice as you.

275
00:24:57,789 --> 00:24:59,749
All they have is dogs,
anybody could have dogs,

276
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,668
but a tame squirrel,
what do you think of that?

277
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,378
I think you're amazing.

278
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:07,298
Look miss, is too sad see you
work for those crazy people.

279
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:10,260
They're maniacs, all of them,
have you seen the son yet?

280
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,554
- No, tell me about him
- He's a monster...

281
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:16,057
a monster with
two heads and a tail.

282
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,309
I'll get to the point,
like an old soldier.

283
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:20,603
Come over with me
in a nice sane household.

284
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,857
You can have everything you want
and no work, Rose will do it all.

285
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:27,068
- Would you give me Davey?
- I'll give him to you

286
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:28,695
And what else?
Girls like lots of presents.

287
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:30,572
You come with me,
I'll give you everything

288
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,034
- What do you call everything?
- My house, my gardens, everything.

289
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,619
- People would talk
- You let them. We'll get married

290
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:38,705
That's an idea, but I'll bet
you're married already

291
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:41,916
No, you'd be the first one
Let me tell you something else...

292
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,377
In my room I have
hidden away 25.000 francs

293
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:47,547
- 25.000 francs!
- And nobody about it but you!

294
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,382
- How's that for a present?
- You'd give it to me?

295
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,885
- Yes I would
- Stop it!

296
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:55,597
Stop it!
You're crushing him!

297
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:59,434
Davey.

298
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:12,864
You did that! I saw you!
Now go back where you belong!

299
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:16,785
- My Baby
- No!

300
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:34,761
What are you doing here?

301
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,021
I bet you like
to see things killed.

302
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:46,981
Not without a purpose.

303
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,903
An orderly woman shouldn't
become involved with the Captain.

304
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,741
- What can he offer you?
- 25.000 francs!

305
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,412
- 25.000 francs
- That's what ha can offer me!

306
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:03,665
All my life I've waited on
people and now...

307
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:06,167
- And now?
- I'm going to get what I can.

308
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:10,380
That's up to you. But there are
safe offers and unsafe ones.

309
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13,258
The death of that squirrel
should be warning to you.

310
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:17,637
Anyway I'm not even interested.

311
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,557
- Someday you will be
- Stop spying on me, you valet!

312
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,870
Telegram for the Lanlaires.

313
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:45,081
- Is it from the son?
- Never mind, see?

314
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:49,461
- Good news or bad.
- Depends on how you look at it.

315
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:50,628
It's from the son, all right.

316
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:54,841
- Then it's bad news.
- I hope so. Stingy old skinflints.

317
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,896
The goose is delicious,
Mariane. Congratulations!

318
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:12,567
You have Joseph to thank for that,
It's the way he kills them.

319
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,945
He sticks a long
pin through their heads...

320
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:18,365
and that way
they die very, very slowly...

321
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:22,535
and the blood stay inside
It's what makes the gravy so rich.

322
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,500
Oh, my pudding!

323
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:33,254
A wire for Monseiur
or Madame Lanlaire.

324
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:34,422
I'll take it.

325
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:39,344
We didn't see you girls in our village
in the last couple of weeks.

326
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:40,720
Don't you like us any more?

327
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:07,247
- Telegram, Madame.
- George!

328
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:10,333
Funny isn't it
we were talking about him.

329
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,548
Oh! My prayers have been answered!

330
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:19,718
Celestine, come with me!

331
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:23,471
- Stop! Stop!
- Put it down!

332
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,890
- Put it down!
- Let me take it

333
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:29,436
Joseph, take the tray
Mariane, Louise!

334
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:31,354
Charles!
Do something, help them!

335
00:29:31,604 --> 00:29:33,732
Get the roses
Put on a decent suit!

336
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:37,068
- My other suit has a hole in it
- Joseph will have to weave it.

337
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:40,613
Your figure is excellent
but I'm not satisfied...

338
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:44,409
with your clothes
we'll do something about it.

339
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,579
- Do something about it?
- Yes, undress please.

340
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:50,457
- Undress?
- I said undress.

341
00:29:51,207 --> 00:29:53,084
I sent all the
way to Paris for this.

342
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:58,089
Hurry up. It shouldn't take you
long to get out of that thing.

343
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,760
- It will fit. Very proper.
- Madame...

344
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:05,847
I'll explain. I told you I was
expecting a very particular guest.

345
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:09,059
Monsieur Lanlaire and myself
are not as young as we were.

346
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:11,311
Our friends don't wish
to visit us as they used to.

347
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:14,773
No, Celestine.
The other way. Yes, that's it.

348
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:17,942
Perhaps a pair of
fresh faces, yours and Louise.

349
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,944
Louise isn't much help,

350
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:22,739
heaven knows, will make it
a little more gay.

351
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,950
Let me see. Very proper
We can take it up here.

352
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:27,786
We'll try
these other dresses later.

353
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:30,080
- Madame, I...
- I almost forgot! You haven't any...

354
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,791
proper perfume, have you?
- No, well, I...

355
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:35,502
Cheap perfume is unforgivable.
Now let me see...

356
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:37,295
Here was what I was looking for.

357
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:40,465
I want you to keep
yourself scented at all times.

358
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:44,052
- But a chambermaid...
- I don't like your hair.

359
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:46,763
- I wear it plain for work
- That's not proper. Sit down.

360
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,308
I want you to copy these exactly

361
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:56,314
And by the time our guest arrives
I want your hair like this.

362
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:03,279
My fine boy, you're home.

363
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:06,908
Everything we have
is for you George.

364
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,415
Father! Hello.

365
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:21,131
I'll see that he never
leaves me again, never!

366
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:35,395
Celestine, go in!

367
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,367
Good afternoon, sir.

368
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:54,080
Sir? Good evening.

369
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:59,836
Madame would like you to enjoy
a bottle of Boef Piquot'65, Sir.

370
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:01,713
- Boef Piquot?
- Yes, Sir

371
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,465
- I've had it.
- Yes...

372
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:09,387
- It's still in the bottle, Sir.
- Go ahead and serve it.

373
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:11,389
Yes Sir.

374
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,228
Come here against the light.

375
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:24,277
Your hair is very nice
Where did you come from?

376
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:26,404
I come from Brittany, Sir.

377
00:32:26,571 --> 00:32:28,948
I was born on Odeire,
where it's windy and foggy...

378
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:31,409
and rough but I love it.
Why, ever since I was...

379
00:32:31,576 --> 00:32:33,828
- Little girl, I've always...
- Never mind.

380
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:38,625
- I've had that story.
- You've had it? Pardon.

381
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,252
- Then you don't want the champagne
- Yes I do.

382
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,256
How long have you been around here?

383
00:32:45,632 --> 00:32:47,509
A little over two weeks, Sir.

384
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,387
I'm sorry, Sir!

385
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:54,140
- Don't worry about the champagne
- Yes, Sir.

386
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:05,193
- You have a cold, Sir
- For about six years.

387
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:08,238
- I'm sorry Sir.
- That's all.

388
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:15,453
- Wait, what's your name.
- My name's Celestine.

389
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,623
- Not actually Celestine, is it?
- Yes it is.

390
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,420
- Pretty fancy uniform you're wearing.
- Thank you. It came from Paris.

391
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,672
- Did you bring it from Paris?
- Me, Sir?

392
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:27,966
- Or did my mother?
- Your mother?

393
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:32,178
- Is she your mother?
- She is.

394
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:38,226
And I'm the scapegoat
of the Lanlaire family.

395
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:39,561
Haven't you heard about me?

396
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:43,481
Captain Mojuet said
that you had two heads and...

397
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:46,026
For heaven sake...

398
00:33:47,193 --> 00:33:49,404
So the Captain gave me
a black mark, did he?

399
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:53,324
The Captain's talks means
nothing, I've had it.

400
00:33:53,491 --> 00:33:55,368
Listen to him and
you'll wind up eating beetles.

401
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,996
- Anything more, Sir?
- More than beetles?

402
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,749
I mean anything
more for you, Sir?

403
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,834
I like what, for instance?

404
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,587
I could read to you.
I could read aloud very well.

405
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:07,589
That would be nice, here.

406
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:12,427
Wait a minute, did they tell
you to entertain me too?

407
00:34:12,927 --> 00:34:15,764
- Why?
- Never mind, I've had it.

408
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:17,807
Very well, Sir.

409
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:59,808
- Marianne, do you think I'll do?
- You'll do.

410
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,894
I'm so excited.

411
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:08,149
Celestine, come here.
I want to talk to you.

412
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:13,154
- Where are you going?
- To the village, it's my day off.

413
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:14,364
Why do you ask?

414
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:16,408
No a good plan
to be seen with Mr. George.

415
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,577
I thought I was
brought here to entertain him.

416
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:23,873
Yes but not in public. Neither
Madame nor I would approve of that.

417
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:26,376
Is that all you wanted to tell me?

418
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:29,295
No, but I have patient
I can wait.

419
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,820
- Hello, Celestine.
- Hello.

420
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,657
- Taking a walk?
- It's my day off.

421
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,285
That's fine.
There's someone following you.

422
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:02,996
- Pierre!
- Where's Lousie?

423
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:06,416
- She's working today.
- I was to wait and the tree and...

424
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:07,375
What's he talking about?

425
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:09,919
He wants to sit with
her under the wishing tree.

426
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:12,088
- Wishing tree?
- The story goes that a...

427
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,674
prince sat there with
a shepherdess and she...

428
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:17,594
made a wish and
he up and married her.

429
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:18,845
Just like that?

430
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:22,974
So when young people want
to get married they sit...

431
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:26,269
there and wish
- Does it work?

432
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:28,855
Well, it did with me, blast it.

433
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:32,692
- Good day Sir.

434
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:34,611
- Hello, Celestine
- Hello, Mr. George.

435
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:38,406
I want you to meet my friends,
the postman and Pierre.

436
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:40,450
- Pleased to know you.
- Say something.

437
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:42,243
- I...
- Tell me.

438
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,456
He says he used to see
you go by in a carriage.

439
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,083
I used to see him
playing in the fields.

440
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:52,295
I remember the day you were born,
Your father let me peek in at you.

441
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:54,673
I'm glad we've met formally at last.

442
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,883
- Well, goodbye, Celestine
- Goodbye.

443
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,469
- Goodbye, and come back often, Sir
- I will.

444
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,054
- Goodbye Celestine.
- Celestine

445
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:02,764
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

446
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:05,141
- Goodbye
- Goodbye

447
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:09,270
I hope you didn't mind
meeting my friend's, Sir

448
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:12,023
I wanted to meet them before
I never knew how to go about it,

449
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,608
Thanks to you, it was quite simple.

450
00:37:13,775 --> 00:37:15,694
You've been away
so much and of course...

451
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:19,155
- Do you mean how I was brought up?
- I didn't mean that.

452
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,491
It's so good to see you
walking in the sunshine.

453
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:24,035
You seem to be
getting better everyday.

454
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:27,580
I have you to thank for that, too
I'll be going along.

455
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,041
Mr. George...

456
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:35,547
- You know why I came to the village?
- Yes, it's your day off.

457
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,632
I overheard you
saying you were coming here.

458
00:37:37,841 --> 00:37:40,385
- You eavesdrop. Do you?
- Always

459
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:43,555
That's practical.
You had something to ask me?

460
00:37:44,014 --> 00:37:47,100
I wondered if I could walking
with you this afternoon as usual

461
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:49,728
as a matter of fact,
I was just going some place to read.

462
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:52,564
Let me read to you,
please. Just one sentence

463
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:54,274
- One sentence?
- Please

464
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:55,900
Go ahead

465
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:01,698
I could a tale unfold
who's lightest word...

466
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,576
would barrow up thy soul...

467
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,494
freeze they young blood
make thy two eyes...

468
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:10,582
I like stars start
from their spheres

469
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:12,542
- I'll bet you thought I could read
- I did

470
00:38:13,209 --> 00:38:16,713
Why do you read such frightening things?

471
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,091
- Makes me feel better by comparison
- This is not good for you.

472
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:24,179
I know a more
soothing kind of poetry

473
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:27,682
- I composed it myself
- Go ahead

474
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:33,146
Little flower, how I pine
For the secret of your beauty

475
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,399
to keep my hands
as soft as thin,

476
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:39,152
And still to do my duty.

477
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:47,202
- Is it so bad?
- Let's sit under the tree.

478
00:38:51,456 --> 00:38:54,834
- That tree?
- Exactly.

479
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:09,933
Now, tell me what
it means, your poem.

480
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:15,063
It means it's hard to keep
your hands as soft as flower...

481
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,899
when you work hard
- Give me your hand.

482
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,782
- Are you making a wish?
- You know about it?

483
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:28,284
I heard tell, that's
why I brought you here.

484
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:30,912
Are you making a wish?

485
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:34,290
Celestine will be happy
with someone, someday.

486
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:39,087
- I'm wishing that you will too.
- No, with me it doesn't matter.

487
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:40,672
Let's walk back to the Chateau.

488
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:43,818
- What's that?
- Somebody is killing somebody.

489
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:46,696
This is a funny house, isn't it?

490
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:49,115
That's just what
I was writing in my diary.

491
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:51,034
No for children.

492
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,621
Do you write everything in there?

493
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:56,373
Even the unhappy things?

494
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:58,958
I used to because that's all
there ever was to write about.

495
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,251
What do you write now?

496
00:41:01,044 --> 00:41:04,673
Lm writing about Mr. Lanlaire
and the Captain next door.

497
00:41:05,632 --> 00:41:09,511
What about Joseph?
He's got a lot of money hidden away

498
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:14,974
- He's an undertaker
- Yes, who's he mad at?

499
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:22,190
I don't know.
This is a place for murder

500
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:26,528
- Celestine, don't talk like that
- Maybe it'll be me, Louise

501
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:29,948
- No
- Maybe it'll be you

502
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:32,075
No, no, no.

503
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,537
There's someone
behind the door, open it.

504
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:37,831
- No, you open it.
- I'll open it.

505
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:44,838
It's late.

506
00:41:45,672 --> 00:41:48,425
You can not staying up.

507
00:41:48,675 --> 00:41:52,554
- It wastes the candles.
- I'll burn all the candles I want.

508
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:54,431
And you stop sneaking
around our door.

509
00:41:55,015 --> 00:41:59,019
Don't be afraid of me,
You and I are alike.

510
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:03,231
Maybe not in looks, but
down underneath, we are the same.

511
00:42:17,203 --> 00:42:19,539
I'd like to make a speech
Will you listen to it?

512
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:23,418
- Of course, Sir.
- I'm going away.

513
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:27,047
- I didn't want to hear that speech.
- I didn't want to make it.

514
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:29,841
- But I can stay here any longer.
- Wasn't the service satisfactory?

515
00:42:30,383 --> 00:42:32,719
- Did we neglect you?
- No, on the contrary.

516
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,929
I appreciate what
you've done, more than you know.

517
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:38,058
Then why do you go?
I've never been so happy before.

518
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:41,770
I don't know, but since I'm going away
will you do me a big favor?

519
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:44,731
- Sir, of course
- Will you call me George?

520
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:47,817
What will Madame Lanlaire
say if she hears it?

521
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,070
I'd like to hear her.

522
00:42:57,827 --> 00:43:00,997
Please, go away. I can't bear
people when I feel like this.

523
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:11,007
I'm not being bold.
I'm Celestine...

524
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:14,427
and I'm here to serve you.
It's my job, so let me do it.

525
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:23,895
- Your fingers are so cold
- Are they, George?

526
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:28,900
I'll tell you something
I thought of just this moment.

527
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:30,193
Tell me.

528
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,904
I Thought,
if I'd met you earlier...

529
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:36,574
I could have waited on you
and care for you and served you...

530
00:43:36,741 --> 00:43:42,205
and things would be different.
- Is the saddest thing I ever heard.

531
00:43:42,414 --> 00:43:46,376
Thank you for telling me
I'd like to tell you something...

532
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:47,627
as a sort of farewell.

533
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:52,215
I've come home
beaten and disillusioned and ill.

534
00:43:52,924 --> 00:43:54,801
I've come to a house
I've never enjoyed...

535
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:57,012
to look upon fields
I've never enjoyed...

536
00:43:57,178 --> 00:43:58,221
to breathe air that stifles me...

537
00:43:58,388 --> 00:44:00,598
It's been less of a homecoming,
more of a defeat.

538
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:05,020
- Why do you tell me this?
- Because your name is Celestine...

539
00:44:05,687 --> 00:44:09,190
and your hair is gold
Because I'm leaving.

540
00:44:09,774 --> 00:44:13,111
Because your bitter
I think that's the same reason.

541
00:44:13,278 --> 00:44:15,864
I can't understand why
You have money, you went to school...

542
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:19,743
you studied law.
Couldn't that have been excited?

543
00:44:19,909 --> 00:44:22,954
I required both
energy and ambition.

544
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:25,206
I never found the urge
to live or die on a big scale.

545
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:28,168
I remember the
first time I saw your hair.

546
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:31,004
I thought it was the
brightest gold I'd ever seen.

547
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:33,882
Madame makes me do it
a fancy way. I don't like it.

548
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:36,092
- How do you like it?
- Just hanging loose on my shoulders.

549
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:39,471
Now lets let it
fall loose for a moment.

550
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,375
I hadn't mean to.
I only meant good bye.

551
00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:20,178
- How does it feel to be in love?
- It changes all the time.

552
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:23,973
Now it hurts terribly
because I don't understand...

553
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:27,811
He almost kissed me and then
ran and locked himself in his room.

554
00:45:27,977 --> 00:45:30,397
I think he's mean to go away.

555
00:45:30,563 --> 00:45:32,148
He's not mean.

556
00:45:32,315 --> 00:45:34,109
He knows what best.
Better than anybody.

557
00:45:35,735 --> 00:45:37,779
I just wish
I could see him once again.

558
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:40,865
A greenhouse is
no place to say goodbye.

559
00:45:41,032 --> 00:45:43,159
I told you
he knows what's best.

560
00:45:44,285 --> 00:45:46,371
- I knew it.
- Who is it?

561
00:45:46,538 --> 00:45:48,081
- It is I.
- Madame.

562
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,502
Celestine, I saw your light.
I know that you were awake.

563
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:54,170
- Yes Madame
- I'm very upset.

564
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:57,590
I've heard my son
pacing up and down in his room.

565
00:45:58,133 --> 00:45:59,926
I' know he's unhappy and ill.

566
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:04,514
- I want you to help me.
- Of course Madame.

567
00:46:05,056 --> 00:46:09,185
Would you get him
a cup of hot broth?

568
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:12,772
- I'll put my uniform.
- Put on my wrapper on.

569
00:46:14,816 --> 00:46:19,070
He wants to leave us.
When he's so ill. I won't have it.

570
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,663
- Who is it?
- It's me, Sir, Celestine.

571
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:30,415
What do you want?

572
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:40,633
- I've brought you some hot broth, Sir.
- I don't want it.

573
00:46:43,845 --> 00:46:46,514
Wait, put it down.

574
00:46:54,689 --> 00:46:57,609
- Celestine.
- Yes, George?

575
00:47:01,738 --> 00:47:04,699
Why do you come here?
What's the idea behind it?

576
00:47:04,866 --> 00:47:06,659
I was told that you couldn't
sleep Sir, so we decided...

577
00:47:06,826 --> 00:47:09,621
- Who told you?
- Madame told me.

578
00:47:09,788 --> 00:47:13,208
I knew it! Come closer.

579
00:47:14,292 --> 00:47:15,460
Yes, George.

580
00:47:16,586 --> 00:47:18,463
I say good bye to you today,
do you remember that?

581
00:47:19,255 --> 00:47:20,715
Didn't I make myself clear?

582
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:22,801
You mean you never wanted
to see me again?

583
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:25,553
I meant a lot of things
which I'll explain.

584
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:32,644
Come in here.
I want to talk to you

585
00:47:33,186 --> 00:47:34,604
- George!
- Mother,

586
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:37,065
inside of here are a lot
of secret fears, moods,

587
00:47:37,232 --> 00:47:39,109
not one particle of hope.
I'm finished.

588
00:47:39,275 --> 00:47:40,944
Now what?
What do you want of me?

589
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:43,530
- I'm trying to get you to stay.
- I know that.

590
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:46,658
- I'll take care of you.
- You leave me alone.

591
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:48,993
I'll watch over you
as I've always done...

592
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,578
since you were a fragile little boy.

593
00:47:50,745 --> 00:47:53,289
Haven't I always protected you?

594
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:55,834
You wanted to posses me as
you posses father and Joseph

595
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:58,169
- George
- Yes, and everyone else around here.

596
00:47:58,336 --> 00:48:00,088
You're tired, and upset.

597
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,590
Whatever I am
will you leave me alone?

598
00:48:02,757 --> 00:48:04,592
- But George...
- Now that you've won,

599
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:07,095
will you get out, and take
your fellow conspirator with you?

600
00:48:07,637 --> 00:48:11,224
- You don't mean that.
- Take her out of here!

601
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:15,353
I've seen all I want of love!
Now, go away!

602
00:48:18,023 --> 00:48:21,568
Then you'll stay?
You've change your mind?

603
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:25,655
My mind has
nothing to do with it.

604
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,285
I've tried to go but
I can't as much as I want to go.

605
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:34,039
I haven't strength to crawl
from here to the village.

606
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:39,711
I'm ill.
Does that satisfy you?

607
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:41,504
Of course,
you haven't the strength.

608
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:43,631
Please, get out!

609
00:48:48,178 --> 00:48:50,055
Get out!

610
00:49:01,524 --> 00:49:04,069
My boy is not himself tonight,

611
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:06,404
But he'll soon be
having you wait on him again.

612
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:08,239
No, he won't.

613
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:10,909
What do you think I am,
an animal or something?

614
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:14,913
That you can send me one
minute and throw me out next?

615
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,873
- Really?
- I hate him...

616
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,876
For pretending to be nice
to me when all the time...

617
00:49:20,043 --> 00:49:22,087
he was just like
you are mean and cruel

618
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:26,675
Look at you!
I found out you're both the same!

619
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:29,928
And I hate you too
I don't want to dress like you,

620
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:31,513
or look like you,
or be like you!

621
00:49:31,721 --> 00:49:34,057
I can't stand it here any more.
I'm through!

622
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:36,559
I'm through!

623
00:49:54,077 --> 00:49:57,789
- Here you are, Celestine.
- I'm not taking them.

624
00:49:57,956 --> 00:49:59,624
But Madame gave them to you.

625
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:03,712
You can take them all. I don't want
anything that reminds me this place.

626
00:50:03,878 --> 00:50:10,010
- Celestine they're beautiful
- Louise, stop crying. Here

627
00:50:10,593 --> 00:50:12,095
And close up my bag.

628
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:17,308
This place frightens me.
I want to get out as fast as I can.

629
00:50:19,436 --> 00:50:25,442
- Louise, help me with this book.
- I'll help you with the book.

630
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:45,045
Joseph, hitch up the carriage
and take me to the station.

631
00:50:45,378 --> 00:50:48,256
- Have you been dismissed?
- No, I haven't.

632
00:50:48,423 --> 00:50:50,216
- Where do you want to go?
- I'm going back to Paris.

633
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:51,968
There's no train
until tomorrow morning.

634
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:55,847
- I'm going to wait in the station.
- Why are you leaving?

635
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:58,975
- Because I hate everybody here.
- Everybody?

636
00:50:59,142 --> 00:51:02,979
Yes, I hate them,
Get me out of here, please.

637
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:04,564
Please, get me out.

638
00:51:11,488 --> 00:51:15,450
I'm a patient man,
and I've waited to talk to you.

639
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:16,951
Just a minute.

640
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:20,872
I've found
a little cafe in Cherbourg.

641
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:22,707
A year ago I made the
down payment, and every month...

642
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:26,002
I've paid more money on it,
Very soon I will own it.

643
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:27,170
How interesting.

644
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:29,130
You listened to George,
now listen to me.

645
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:33,051
Sit down here.

646
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:38,807
You know Cherbourg?
It's an interesting town,

647
00:51:38,973 --> 00:51:40,934
It's full of
soldiers and sailors.

648
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:43,269
They like a good time, drink...

649
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:47,565
Iook at a beautiful woman.
I could make a fortune.

650
00:51:47,732 --> 00:51:49,651
I need someone
like you to run it for me.

651
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:51,528
Aside from everything else
it's insulting.

652
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:54,114
Insulting?
I don't know what you mean.

653
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,449
You sit behind the bar and
count the money you laugh and...

654
00:51:56,616 --> 00:51:58,326
talk with the soldiers.
They won't dare to insult you

655
00:51:58,493 --> 00:52:01,621
because everybody
will know that you are my wife

656
00:52:02,288 --> 00:52:05,208
Yes Celestine,
I'm going to marry you.

657
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:11,464
I want you, I need you,
more than you can understand.

658
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:13,758
You're in my brain and my blood.

659
00:52:13,925 --> 00:52:16,636
I've seen your eyes.
They frighten me.

660
00:52:16,803 --> 00:52:19,931
- You like Mr. George better?
- Don't speak about him, ever.

661
00:52:20,098 --> 00:52:23,059
All right. But you an I,
Celestine, we are the same.

662
00:52:23,226 --> 00:52:25,395
I don't want to be
a servant any more than you do.

663
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:27,605
You're a valet
and you always will.

664
00:52:27,772 --> 00:52:31,484
No, I won't!
I tell you we are alike.

665
00:52:31,776 --> 00:52:33,528
Maybe the worst of me is like you.

666
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:38,241
I've tried to be good always.
Ever since I was a little girl.

667
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,910
But every time
I'd see a new man's face...

668
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:44,748
and I'd look into his eyes
to see what was behind them...

669
00:52:45,665 --> 00:52:47,625
and I never knew
until it was too late.

670
00:52:47,792 --> 00:52:50,462
Until I'd been hurt.

671
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,465
I'm not trying to hurt you
I want to free you...

672
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:57,010
Don't you see?
Think of the cafe,

673
00:52:57,177 --> 00:53:00,305
You're own mistress
You'll rule it like a queen.

674
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:04,601
Madame is ringing
you'd better answer.

675
00:53:04,768 --> 00:53:07,437
I won't be humiliated again.

676
00:53:07,604 --> 00:53:10,899
A few more days and
we'll be free of this people.

677
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:12,650
Think of your revenge.

678
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:15,695
You'll ride back here not as
a servant, but as a mistress,

679
00:53:15,904 --> 00:53:19,157
In a carriage with
two horses, with four horses.

680
00:53:19,324 --> 00:53:21,242
Will Madame humiliate you then?

681
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:24,954
She will bow to you and
bite her lip's with envy.

682
00:53:25,413 --> 00:53:29,209
- It will never happen.
- Yes, it will. I have a plan.

683
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:32,420
- Plans can get you into trouble.
- No this one.

684
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:35,340
I've put too much
time and effort into it.

685
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:39,552
For ten years I have had
the unpleasant job of working...

686
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:41,471
my way into Madame's good graces.
Ten years of devotion until...

687
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:46,851
I had her confidence
and the proper set of keys.

688
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:51,690
- Why did you this?
- For one purpose: Freedom.

689
00:53:51,898 --> 00:53:54,526
The 14th of July. After
the midnight banquet is over...

690
00:53:54,693 --> 00:53:57,654
the way is clear
- You mean the silver?

691
00:53:57,987 --> 00:54:01,116
- What I mean is my affair
- I can't stay in this house.

692
00:54:01,282 --> 00:54:03,284
- I'll meet you in Paris or Cherbourg.
- I can't let you go now.

693
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:05,704
- Joseph.
- Don't struggle. I want you.

694
00:54:06,287 --> 00:54:07,580
- Joseph.
- We are alone now.

695
00:54:07,747 --> 00:54:09,040
All right. I'll stay.

696
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:14,629
I'll give you one more day,
If you're not ready. I'll go alone.

697
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:16,798
I've been fooled for the last time.

698
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:34,858
- So much more, Joseph?
- We are about finished.

699
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:39,612
If I had my way, we'd use
this stuff all the time, or sell it.

700
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:42,782
Would you, Charles?
You've bent that cruet.

701
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:46,661
- When are you leaving?
- Tomorrow Madame.

702
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:49,622
- Alone?
- I think so.

703
00:54:50,206 --> 00:54:52,083
Isn't the silver
beautiful, Joseph?

704
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,378
- I've always thought so.
- Yes I know.

705
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:05,263
This you hear Madame?
They're beginning the celebration.

706
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:07,557
They play the same
old tunes every year.

707
00:55:07,724 --> 00:55:10,393
We're about finished
Could we go to the village?

708
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:13,104
Nobody leaves this house
on the 14th of July.

709
00:55:13,271 --> 00:55:15,857
- We don't approve it
- What do you mean by we?

710
00:55:16,024 --> 00:55:19,069
I've decided that everybody
shall go for one hour.

711
00:55:19,235 --> 00:55:20,820
- You mean all of us?
- No, not you.

712
00:55:20,987 --> 00:55:24,324
- Pick some roses.
- This is boring.

713
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:31,331
And now, Joseph,
give me the keys to the vault.

714
00:55:31,873 --> 00:55:33,667
- The keys?
- Yes.

715
00:55:34,376 --> 00:55:35,418
Celestine.

716
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:42,550
After ten years,
I demand an explanation.

717
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:47,806
It has come over me that perhaps
I've done you an injustice...

718
00:55:47,972 --> 00:55:49,641
by placing temptation in your way.

719
00:55:50,433 --> 00:55:53,228
I shudder to think how easy
it could have been for you...

720
00:55:53,395 --> 00:55:55,647
to enter the vault anytime
you wished, knowing the theft...

721
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:57,941
would not be discovered
until the following year.

722
00:55:58,692 --> 00:56:01,403
Yes, I've really
done you a great injustice.

723
00:56:02,028 --> 00:56:04,531
Having been your confidential steward...

724
00:56:04,698 --> 00:56:07,951
for so long,
this hurts me very deeply.

725
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:12,622
I understand, Joseph.
Now give me the keys.

726
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:19,212
You want all the
keys to all the rooms?

727
00:56:20,672 --> 00:56:22,632
Now carry that silver
to the dining room.

728
00:56:34,602 --> 00:56:36,271
You'll always be a valet Joseph.

729
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:57,625
What's the matter?
Did she take the keys?

730
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:01,880
- I doesn't matter
- One more day, and I leave alone.

731
00:57:02,714 --> 00:57:05,675
- Things will work out.
You'll come with me.

732
00:57:05,884 --> 00:57:09,095
All right!
But get the money first.

733
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:13,516
Celestine, come on!
We've only got an hour!

734
00:57:13,683 --> 00:57:16,728
- Are you coming with us?
- No, run along.

735
00:57:16,895 --> 00:57:19,564
But is no fun alone,
Who'll buy me things?

736
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:23,943
Hurray for the Republic!

737
00:57:32,243 --> 00:57:33,953
Why not take Captain Mojuet?

738
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,916
- Mojuet? Are you serious?
- He'll buy you things and...

739
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:42,504
- I will keep him amused for while.
- All right, I will.

740
00:57:43,505 --> 00:57:47,133
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

741
00:57:51,471 --> 00:57:52,472
Celestine!

742
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:58,687
- You off to the celebration?
- Would you like to be our escort?

743
00:57:58,853 --> 00:58:01,189
- Naturally.

744
00:58:03,441 --> 00:58:05,568
- Where are you going?
- I'm all dress up.

745
00:58:05,735 --> 00:58:07,696
Wait for me Captain!

746
00:58:07,862 --> 00:58:10,281
All right. Go on to the village,
I'll meet you in the square.

747
00:58:13,868 --> 00:58:18,707
- Where are you going my little plum?
- To the celebration with you.

748
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:21,292
In that case,
let's go this way. Go this way.

749
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:31,511
- Here give me the keys.
- Did you forget something?

750
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:34,806
Yes, I did,
I forgot my money.

751
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:37,017
I'll get it and
show you good time.

752
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,601
Come with me!

753
00:58:39,394 --> 00:58:43,606
I'm going to play a little game.
No, no, no!

754
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:48,361
I capture the enemy.

755
00:58:48,528 --> 00:58:51,823
- You can come out on Saturday.
- You Rascal, is that Celestine?

756
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:54,576
Yes, you couldn't get better
if you were the enemy himself.

757
00:59:50,882 --> 00:59:52,926
Celestine!

758
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:57,555
Here you are.

759
01:00:00,392 --> 01:00:02,143
Captain, you didn't pay for that.

760
01:00:02,435 --> 01:00:04,854
How's it go Captain?
Have you tried anything new lately?

761
01:00:06,189 --> 01:00:08,233
Where are you?
Celestine?

762
01:00:17,033 --> 01:00:18,159
Celestine!

763
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:29,629
- Celestine! Here you are!
- Captain, Captain

764
01:00:31,339 --> 01:00:34,718
Fellows, get me a drink
get me a drink.

765
01:00:35,635 --> 01:00:36,636
A drink!

766
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,395
There's the Captain.

767
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:54,446
- Here you are!
- Celestine, I've been looking for you.

768
01:00:54,612 --> 01:00:56,656
Me too. Come on
and buy me something.

769
01:00:58,158 --> 01:01:00,952
Hit the bulls eye, Captain.

770
01:01:01,202 --> 01:01:03,288
- Are you a good shot?
- I learned in the army, and you?

771
01:01:03,496 --> 01:01:06,499
- Wait and see.
- Mine's broke!

772
01:01:06,624 --> 01:01:07,625
- Try the other one.
- Come on every body.

773
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:11,296
Have a free shot,
the Captain will pay for it!

774
01:01:11,463 --> 01:01:14,716
- Certainly will.
- Try the other gun, Captain.

775
01:01:14,883 --> 01:01:18,345
Help yourself!
The generous man in the country!

776
01:01:18,511 --> 01:01:22,223
- Well, pretty good sport!
- I've finished!

777
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:24,851
Captain has paid for everything.

778
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:28,104
- See how popular you are?
- I hope my money holds out.

779
01:01:28,271 --> 01:01:32,067
Celestine, ask him to take you
to the other booth. It's more fun.

780
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:34,652
- Well, let's go?
- Can you get a drink there?

781
01:01:37,781 --> 01:01:40,367
Captain, try your strength.

782
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:47,499
Hold it. Now?

783
01:01:58,718 --> 01:02:01,304
This is the place, Celestine.
Isn't it fun?

784
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,599
Look at the bride, the groom,
the mother-in-law...

785
01:02:06,893 --> 01:02:09,979
Captain, thanks a million times.

786
01:02:10,146 --> 01:02:12,065
Haven't got much left.
Here you are.

787
01:02:12,232 --> 01:02:15,110
- Let's throw some more.
- Yes we will. Go ahead.

788
01:02:18,029 --> 01:02:20,824
Good! No watch this!

789
01:02:22,992 --> 01:02:24,744
Yeah!

790
01:02:26,329 --> 01:02:30,250
- That means you're gonna get married.
- You the bride, I hit the groom.

791
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:33,586
- I guess I can't get out of it
- Right! And talk it over.

792
01:02:35,714 --> 01:02:38,508
No, give me a full bottle.

793
01:02:38,758 --> 01:02:41,970
I haven't any more money.
Yes, I have. That's all.

794
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:45,306
Celestine! This way.

795
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:48,143
Let's sit there.

796
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:49,310
- No.
- Why not?

797
01:02:49,477 --> 01:02:51,563
- That's the wishing tree.
- Yes I know.

798
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:54,399
I wish...

799
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:58,987
Celestine and me would go
to Paris together and get married...

800
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:01,489
In the Cathedral.

801
01:03:01,656 --> 01:03:04,701
Don't say that! Only weak
people sit around under trees...

802
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:06,828
and wish for things.
It's better to do it yourself.

803
01:03:08,872 --> 01:03:11,875
You're right, no wishes.
There's a train in a few hours...

804
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:13,418
that'll take us.
How's for an idea?

805
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:15,628
- We'll go to Paris?
- Yes! You wait here.

806
01:03:15,795 --> 01:03:17,964
I'll run home and get some money.
I'm a man of action.

807
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:02,425
I've got the best girl in the world.

808
01:04:06,429 --> 01:04:10,767
I'm going to
Paris with Celestine.

809
01:04:18,441 --> 01:04:22,404
I'm going to Paris...
Not a bad idea.

810
01:04:24,447 --> 01:04:27,492
I'm gonna go to Paris...

811
01:04:37,752 --> 01:04:41,673
Captain, let me out!
Please let me out!

812
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,675
You old bat!
Be quiet!

813
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:46,845
Get my money,
Get my money.

814
01:04:47,012 --> 01:04:50,682
You won't go with Celestine!
You know what she'll do?

815
01:04:50,849 --> 01:04:53,727
- She'll take your money
- Celestine!

816
01:04:53,893 --> 01:04:56,354
She'll run away and leave you.

817
01:04:59,649 --> 01:05:02,235
Don't take your
money and go with her!

818
01:05:49,366 --> 01:05:53,119
It is an honor to dedicate
the next song to you...

819
01:05:53,536 --> 01:05:57,207
- 'La Belle Parisienne'
- That's very sweet.

820
01:05:59,209 --> 01:06:01,628
Everybody
'La Belle Parisienne'

821
01:06:07,717 --> 01:06:10,428
- Celestine!
- Celestine!

822
01:06:15,725 --> 01:06:18,478
- ¡Vive Celestine!

823
01:06:30,865 --> 01:06:34,869
Captain! You've got
to come and let me out!

824
01:06:35,036 --> 01:06:38,915
Please!
Please! Let me out!

825
01:06:46,923 --> 01:06:51,594
Baby! I'm sorry.
I won't scold you anymore.

826
01:06:51,761 --> 01:06:55,765
Baby, be a good baby.
Yes, mommy loves you.

827
01:06:55,932 --> 01:07:02,313
I'll do anything just let me out!

828
01:07:11,489 --> 01:07:15,160
Vive la Republique!

829
01:07:23,251 --> 01:07:26,921
Hurray!
Vive la Republique! Hurray!

830
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:36,431
I wonder what
happened to the captain?

831
01:07:36,848 --> 01:07:40,602
That's right! We'd better go
we'll be late at Chateau.

832
01:07:40,769 --> 01:07:43,897
- Don't go!
- I'm afraid we'll have to.

833
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:46,316
I'm going to do something
I've never done before.

834
01:07:46,483 --> 01:07:48,735
The Lanlaires don't like us.

835
01:07:48,902 --> 01:07:51,446
We don't like him,
But tonight...

836
01:07:51,613 --> 01:07:53,573
we're going to march
and play under their window.

837
01:07:54,366 --> 01:07:57,577
In honor of you Celestine
but don't forget to listen.

838
01:07:57,744 --> 01:07:59,371
Don't forget to come!

839
01:07:59,829 --> 01:08:04,250
- Goodbye, everybody!
- Wait for me.

840
01:08:47,377 --> 01:08:52,382
Captain Mojuet was darling.
He bought us everything.

841
01:08:52,549 --> 01:08:56,386
- It's late
- Have you been digging for treasure?

842
01:08:56,594 --> 01:08:59,305
- Funny, isn't he?
- Like an undertaker

843
01:08:59,806 --> 01:09:03,393
Let's go to the Lanlaire's
and play for Celestine.

844
01:09:04,477 --> 01:09:07,939
Everybody, One!

845
01:09:18,616 --> 01:09:21,327
There's another woman murdered in Paris.

846
01:09:22,078 --> 01:09:24,122
Another woman cut to pieces.

847
01:09:24,706 --> 01:09:26,207
- Charles...
- Yes, dear?

848
01:09:29,336 --> 01:09:32,797
- Here you are, Marianne.
- Our dinner it's ruined.

849
01:09:32,964 --> 01:09:36,009
- Here's the salad.
- Everybody into the dining room.

850
01:09:36,343 --> 01:09:40,805
- What do we do there?
- We drink a toast. We do it every year.

851
01:09:44,851 --> 01:09:48,063
You gave me one more
day to leave for Cherbourg.

852
01:09:48,229 --> 01:09:50,273
- I'm ready to go
- You've got the silver?

853
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:51,983
- I've got the money.
- How?

854
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:53,360
That needn't concern you.

855
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:58,073
My Captain!
Where's my Captain?

856
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,034
- Where is he?
- You're hurting me.

857
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:03,244
He broke open his locker,
he took his money...

858
01:10:03,411 --> 01:10:05,330
and ran away
- What you're talking about?

859
01:10:05,497 --> 01:10:08,041
- Be quiet! You're hysterical!
- You know!

860
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:10,835
She led and tricked him!
He did it for you!

861
01:10:11,002 --> 01:10:14,422
- He's drunk in the village
- You hid him somewhere.

862
01:10:14,589 --> 01:10:15,757
She stole my baby!

863
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:20,887
- Get off the property!
- My baby, Captain.

864
01:10:21,054 --> 01:10:25,767
Where are you baby?

865
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:32,440
Where is he?

866
01:10:35,568 --> 01:10:36,569
Joseph.

867
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:41,074
Joseph, wait.

868
01:10:41,574 --> 01:10:43,827
You were in Mojuet's garden.
You killed him!

869
01:10:43,993 --> 01:10:46,871
We killed him!
You were in hurry for the cafe.

870
01:10:47,038 --> 01:10:49,082
- We are in this together.
- No, I...

871
01:10:49,374 --> 01:10:50,375
Be quiet!

872
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:54,254
Come on!

873
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,428
Open the door.

874
01:11:04,931 --> 01:11:05,932
Get in.

875
01:11:15,316 --> 01:11:17,360
Joseph, serve the wine, please.

876
01:11:28,997 --> 01:11:31,332
The music sounds louder than usual.

877
01:11:50,894 --> 01:11:54,522
George, there's a question
I've been wanting to answer.

878
01:11:54,773 --> 01:11:57,067
- Yes?
- How are we going to end...

879
01:11:57,233 --> 01:12:00,236
the Republic just by closing
the shutter once a year...

880
01:12:00,403 --> 01:12:01,988
and celebrating
with this confounded silver?

881
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,824
This isn't a celebration
It's a funeral for ourselves...

882
01:12:04,991 --> 01:12:08,578
and every one like us
- Well, that's the question.

883
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:11,664
Here's death to the Republic!

884
01:12:16,336 --> 01:12:17,462
To you, George!

885
01:12:17,629 --> 01:12:21,174
If you should ever leave me
again I couldn't go on living.

886
01:12:23,218 --> 01:12:25,970
- Death to the Republic!
- Madame,

887
01:12:26,805 --> 01:12:29,766
I'm taking this occasion
to make an announcement...

888
01:12:30,183 --> 01:12:32,977
I've served you faithfully...

889
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:36,731
for 10 years, 3 months
and 3 days to be exact.

890
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:39,943
But like so many
other people of my class...

891
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:43,196
I had the ambition that
one day I'd be my own master...

892
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:45,073
That day has come.

893
01:12:45,615 --> 01:12:49,411
I have saved and
invested my money carefully...

894
01:12:49,577 --> 01:12:51,913
until I was able
to buy a little business.

895
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,251
- I thought you'd be glad to hear it
- You mean you are leaving?

896
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:57,419
Yes, sir.

897
01:12:57,711 --> 01:12:59,754
That's too bad!

898
01:13:00,630 --> 01:13:02,882
- How soon will you go?
- Right away.

899
01:13:03,049 --> 01:13:04,259
We're leaving tonight.

900
01:13:04,426 --> 01:13:08,013
Perhaps I should also announce
that I'm going to get married.

901
01:13:09,723 --> 01:13:11,599
I found myself a wife.

902
01:13:11,766 --> 01:13:14,102
- Celestine?
- Yes, Celestine.

903
01:13:14,269 --> 01:13:16,062
- You're a liar.
- George...

904
01:13:16,229 --> 01:13:18,940
Get out of this room...

905
01:13:19,107 --> 01:13:20,400
for a moment I took you seriously.

906
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:22,068
- He's not lying.
- I don't believe you.

907
01:13:22,235 --> 01:13:24,988
- I give you a chance to get out.
- Don't say anymore.

908
01:13:25,155 --> 01:13:29,075
I'm sorry you don't believe me.
She loves me and we are going away.

909
01:13:29,242 --> 01:13:31,870
- Take me away now.
- I congratulate you.

910
01:13:32,037 --> 01:13:34,456
Let's all drink a toast
to Celestine's future.

911
01:13:34,622 --> 01:13:36,332
But first
let me see you kiss him.

912
01:13:36,624 --> 01:13:38,752
We are not used to
kissing in public.

913
01:13:38,918 --> 01:13:41,880
Not in public?
Are you ashamed?

914
01:13:42,047 --> 01:13:45,342
You should be proud
Take him in your arms...

915
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:47,719
hold him, kiss him
embrace him!

916
01:13:50,096 --> 01:13:51,931
Celestine!

917
01:13:54,809 --> 01:13:58,480
- George, where are you going?
- Flying to the moon.

918
01:13:58,646 --> 01:14:01,399
She cares nothing for you.
It was my orders,

919
01:14:01,566 --> 01:14:03,485
she is a servant
she belongs with a servant.

920
01:14:03,651 --> 01:14:06,446
- Let her go with Joseph.
- That's what I want to listen.

921
01:14:06,654 --> 01:14:09,532
You're a liar, thieves.
That's as it should be...

922
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:12,035
but she's a servant.
She has no feelings, morals, rights...

923
01:14:12,243 --> 01:14:15,163
- You're my son!
- That's what I'm trying to forget.

924
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:20,251
Celestine!

925
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:25,131
Hurray for my son!

926
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:43,316
- What did you say?
- I said, Hurray for my son.

927
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:49,155
Let the music come in!

928
01:14:49,322 --> 01:14:51,991
Let's he free!
Open the shutters!

929
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:56,579
Hurray for my son!
Hurray the revolution!

930
01:14:56,746 --> 01:14:59,207
You miserable fool!
Sit down!

931
01:15:02,669 --> 01:15:04,295
Joseph, close those shutters!

932
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:19,853
Before you go I want you
to do something for me.

933
01:15:22,230 --> 01:15:25,400
- What is it Madame?
- George is bewitched by her.

934
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,861
When I brought her here.
I didn't bargain for this.

935
01:15:28,028 --> 01:15:31,364
Infatuation is complete.
He'll go away, and never return.

936
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:35,118
- You can take her with you.
- It will take a certain price.

937
01:15:35,285 --> 01:15:37,120
- A price for me?
- Yes.

938
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:39,289
- What is it?
- The silverware.

939
01:15:39,789 --> 01:15:43,585
- You're as insane as the rest.
- Very well Madame, goodnight!

940
01:15:43,752 --> 01:15:46,421
You know what
the silver means to me.

941
01:15:48,298 --> 01:15:50,759
- That's why I want it.
- To hurt me.

942
01:15:50,925 --> 01:15:54,679
I must have it as
you had it for my peace of mind.

943
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,474
It represents
to me as it has to you.

944
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:01,394
My new position in life.
My security.

945
01:16:03,563 --> 01:16:05,065
I'll give you one piece.

946
01:16:11,488 --> 01:16:14,407
- I'll give you this.
- I want all of them.

947
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:17,786
No, I'll divide it with you.

948
01:16:18,370 --> 01:16:19,662
- I'll give you half.
- All of it.

949
01:16:19,829 --> 01:16:23,291
You'll leave me my
candelabra, and this, and this.

950
01:16:23,458 --> 01:16:25,835
All of it
and you'd better decide quick.

951
01:16:26,002 --> 01:16:32,884
- All of it!
- All right! Take it all!

952
01:16:39,182 --> 01:16:43,603
- Why do you come here?
- I must.

953
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:46,648
I love you Celestine.

954
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:48,942
But you told me to get out, that
you never wanted to see me again.

955
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:51,319
I was wrong.
Will you forgive me?

956
01:16:51,486 --> 01:16:54,072
It's too late.
I have to make you understand.

957
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,032
- You mean about Joseph?
- Please believe me George.

958
01:16:56,199 --> 01:16:58,576
- You mean about Joseph?
- Yes because of Joseph!

959
01:17:00,245 --> 01:17:04,082
- You don't love him.
- I love you George...

960
01:17:04,666 --> 01:17:07,419
But I can't be with you.

961
01:17:07,585 --> 01:17:09,379
I know why.
Because I'm ill?

962
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:11,881
- Don't say that, it's cruel.
- I knew from the beginning,

963
01:17:12,048 --> 01:17:13,883
That's why I tried to leave you.
I understood you were afraid.

964
01:17:14,092 --> 01:17:16,720
- Afraid?
- Afraid of my lips.

965
01:17:16,886 --> 01:17:20,974
- It's not true,
Come here!

966
01:17:29,149 --> 01:17:30,483
You see it's not true?

967
01:17:31,818 --> 01:17:35,488
I wish there were
no other place but right there...

968
01:17:36,322 --> 01:17:41,161
- No other time, but now.
- My dearest

969
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:51,087
- Why are you crying?
- Because I love you.

970
01:18:38,718 --> 01:18:39,719
Go away!

971
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:45,392
- Don't touch him!
- I wouldn't harm Mr. George.

972
01:18:45,558 --> 01:18:47,352
Not if you come with me.

973
01:18:51,564 --> 01:18:55,068
Murderer!

974
01:18:55,235 --> 01:18:58,321
Murderer!

975
01:19:01,908 --> 01:19:03,326
Murderer!

976
01:19:18,049 --> 01:19:21,219
Murderer! Murderer!

977
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:25,515
Stop it Joseph!
Murderer.

978
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:39,821
Joseph!

979
01:19:45,493 --> 01:19:50,123
- If you touch him. I'll kill you
- Did I start? Come on!

980
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:54,878
George, keep away!!

981
01:20:10,769 --> 01:20:13,772
Keep away!

982
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:22,113
Are you coming with me now?
Or do I have to kill him too?

983
01:21:07,909 --> 01:21:12,455
Your luggage is in the carriage,
Everything is prepared.

984
01:21:19,879 --> 01:21:22,757
The silver it's ours.
All of it.

985
01:21:22,924 --> 01:21:26,636
You'll eat from it
like a queen, and here.

986
01:22:10,555 --> 01:22:14,142
Look, everybody
Celestine is back!

987
01:22:16,853 --> 01:22:19,272
Get out my way
I'm in a hurry

988
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:28,365
I tell you
I want to get through

989
01:22:28,531 --> 01:22:31,284
Did you hear our music?
We played it for you.

990
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:33,411
Don't run away
that's you're hurry?

991
01:22:33,578 --> 01:22:36,915
If you don't let me through
I'll use the win.

992
01:22:37,332 --> 01:22:40,293
Make way, I tell you!

993
01:22:42,796 --> 01:22:44,714
Lets see what's inside there!

994
01:22:49,886 --> 01:22:52,555
What do you mean Joseph?
Help me down, somebody!

995
01:22:53,014 --> 01:22:55,475
- I'll kill the next person...
- What do you mean?

996
01:22:56,393 --> 01:22:58,269
I'll kill the next person
who touches these trunks

997
01:22:58,436 --> 01:23:00,939
That's an awful
word to use Joseph.

998
01:23:01,106 --> 01:23:03,191
Did you hear what he said?
My husband to be?

999
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:06,319
This is my wedding present and
I'm going to share it with you.

1000
01:23:06,528 --> 01:23:09,447
- Here take it! Take it!

1001
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:15,662
Here take it, take it!

1002
01:23:23,169 --> 01:23:27,132
Stay away!

1003
01:23:33,263 --> 01:23:34,973
Strange thing about me Joseph.

1004
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,558
The more I'm beaten,
the stronger I get.

1005
01:23:36,725 --> 01:23:38,810
You'd think
I'd be finished, wouldn't you?

1006
01:23:58,913 --> 01:24:00,540
Move back!

1007
01:24:14,429 --> 01:24:18,558
Stop it!
Stop it!

1008
01:25:55,405 --> 01:25:59,451
I want you to write
something on the last page...

1009
01:26:03,913 --> 01:26:05,874
Forsaking all others...

1010
01:26:08,335 --> 01:26:11,254
through sickness, and health...

1011
01:26:21,973 --> 01:26:23,767
for better or for worse...

1012
01:26:26,895 --> 01:26:29,147
till death do us part.

1013
