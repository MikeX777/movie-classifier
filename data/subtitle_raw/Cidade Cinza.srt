00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:19,892
"GREY CITY"

2
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:29,902
SÃO PAULO, DECEMBER 2008

3
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:36,273
This city was not
made for the people.

4
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:40,610
It's made for cars, for the
robots, you know?

5
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:44,480
Who have a routine of going and
coming back from work,

6
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:48,455
doing everyday
the very same thing.

7
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,894
And once a year they decide
to do something different.

8
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:58,360
Once a year or maybe twice...
But why is that?

9
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:04,439
São Paulo has no beach, man!

10
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:07,408
If you're stressed, you go
to the sea, you surf a little,

11
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,879
you feel great.

12
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,904
But São Paulo is a concrete
jungle buildings, buildings

13
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:16,418
and more buildings... The more you
build, the less you have trees

14
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,384
and parks... And more
and more buildings...

15
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:21,920
As if you're building a wall
around you, you know?

16
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:24,728
So you have to escape, any how you
have to runaway from all these.

17
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,596
Or be apart of it.

18
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:28,860
That's the history
of graffiti, you know?

19
00:02:28,965 --> 00:02:32,366
Of "picho"... you belong to it!

20
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:36,771
And the youth is talking.

21
00:02:36,873 --> 00:02:40,570
It's not only graffiti,
it's "picho" as well.

22
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,879
A lot of people manifesting,
talking...

23
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,014
The guy is there cause he needs
to express himself.

24
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:47,574
Some stuff, you know?

25
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:52,745
But I think graffiti and "picho"
are the only movements nowadays,

26
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:56,626
in which the young
people talk, for real.

27
00:02:56,626 --> 00:03:00,653
Cause nowadays they are very
settled, very quiet, you know?

28
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:09,904
- These people are talking.
- They are occupying buildings.

29
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:11,873
They are occupying the city.

30
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,875
In away or another, they are
expressing themselves,

31
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,843
questioning something...

32
00:03:15,912 --> 00:03:21,009
The guy is beating the system
and doing what he wants.

33
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:23,909
The city suffocates you
and you need to talk,

34
00:03:23,987 --> 00:03:26,790
you need to put your
name on it. And you do it.

35
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,887
The guy has the energy to go there
and do it. And fuck it, I did it.

36
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:42,932
I think, since the very first guy
who took a spray and scribbled,

37
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:45,602
I don't know,
anything, on street.

38
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:49,333
He was already
questioning this, right?

39
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,967
How the city could be used...

40
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:59,003
Not only to... not only
to display a product,

41
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:01,718
to sell a car or
something like that...

42
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,989
But also to make art, right?

43
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:10,483
It's not an art that only
one person owns.

44
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:37,483
In São Paulo is
pretty easy to paint.

45
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,849
You just don't paint if
you don't want to.

46
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,891
Like, people have other
things to worry about,

47
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:43,082
look at the traffic jam!

48
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:45,094
Everybody is trying to get
somewhere, do you really think

49
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,963
they're going to worry that
someone is painting the wall?

50
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:48,931
They want to arrive at their
house, or to their job...

51
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,454
This is Babylon,
man, this is chaos.

52
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,422
A chaotic city deserves
chaos, you know?

53
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:38,544
I don't wanna drive
by with my car here

54
00:06:38,614 --> 00:06:39,774
and see that wall
painted grey.

55
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:44,115
I don't wanna see grey, I want to
see color, so I'm gonna change it.

56
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:46,155
I'll put some color over there
and put my name on it.

57
00:06:46,222 --> 00:06:47,985
I wanna see my name on the city.

58
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,697
São Paulo being the way it is...

59
00:07:04,907 --> 00:07:08,536
Giving us the freedom
to paint during the day.

60
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:11,014
With or without permission.

61
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,778
Allowed us to do our
job, to create it.

62
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:19,177
Everything we learned was here,
in São Paulo, in the streets.

63
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:21,955
And it's the same for many
other graffiti artists.

64
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,219
And this work was valued
abroad, you know?

65
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,229
The work we took abroad
was created here.

66
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:43,879
QOSGEMEQOS - PORTUGAL

67
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:51,749
OSGEMEQOS - USA

68
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:57,824
NUNCA - ITALY

69
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:05,892
NUNCA - CANADA

70
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,900
NINA - INDIA

71
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,801
I think being on the
streets gives you the power

72
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:13,635
to talk to all the people.

73
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,648
Regardless of social class or
cultural life a person has or not.

74
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:22,585
And you can talk either positive
or negative things.

75
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,954
It's a very strong weapon,
because it works with image.

76
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:29,681
And image is a direct language,
you don't need to stop

77
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,123
to read it or listen to it.

78
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:36,131
You see it and it's in your
mind already, unconsciously.

79
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:38,257
Like a subliminal message.

80
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:41,660
I think image on street
is powerful!

81
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:09,732
If we think the city
as a support.

82
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:13,002
And graffiti as one
manifestation of it.

83
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:15,971
Graffiti is one of the most
interesting things São Paulo

84
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:18,674
produces and considering
a chaotic city like São Paulo,

85
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:22,838
graffiti helps composing
the chaos itself.

86
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:24,774
When [ first left Brazil,

87
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:28,940
I thought this chaos was a
negative thing, but on coming back

88
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,754
I realized chaos is the best
thing we have.

89
00:09:31,754 --> 00:09:34,917
Because that's what makes
us more creative.

90
00:09:35,057 --> 00:09:36,888
That our "Brazilian way"

91
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:40,129
has not only a vicious side of
improvising all the time.

92
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:44,361
But that there's a side of
creativity and generosity,

93
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:48,130
and I think and
graffiti is part of it.

94
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:50,290
What got my attention regarding
painting on the streets

95
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,096
back in those days...

96
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:04,369
someone I've never met could
see my work, you know?

97
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:07,877
From the moment I draw
something on the streets,

98
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:13,320
it's not mine anymore,
it becomes a public good.

99
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:32,908
It feels that the wall
is a dirty support,

100
00:11:32,908 --> 00:11:36,412
but you don't touch the
wall, the paint does.

101
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:39,347
Crazy enough, you don't
make contact to the wall,

102
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:44,178
the paint does it;
it's quite magic!

103
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,082
Comes from your mind,
passes through the veins

104
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:49,989
and through your instrument,
this is an instrument.

105
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:54,954
The ink then leaves
the spray towards the wall;

106
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:57,124
we don't touch the wall.

107
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,500
It's magic, you don't
touch the dirt;

108
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:03,532
you transform it on
something nice.

109
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:14,946
It's a subliminal magic, you don't
realize it's happening, but it is.

110
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:18,011
Spray does it.

111
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,918
It's different from picking up
a brush and painting the wall.

112
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:24,424
Spray is sort of magic,
what it offers you, what it can do.

113
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:25,992
If you hold a spray can,

114
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:27,893
you'll feel like writing
your name or doing anything.

115
00:12:28,064 --> 00:12:30,965
To anyone you give a spray can,
they will press "tsss tsss"

116
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:35,402
and look for a place to write,
you know? It's automatic.

117
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:38,441
Well, there is the magic.

118
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:45,142
And when this is part of you,
there's nothing you can do,

119
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:48,478
but do it. Just move
on and let it out.

120
00:13:01,163 --> 00:13:07,124
I believe this is the most direct
way of treating each person

121
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:09,294
who passes by as human being.

122
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:14,571
Cause we don't see
each car as a gear.

123
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:19,982
Each car that passes
by has a story,

124
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:25,215
the guy who argued with his
wife, a girl who fell in love.

125
00:13:27,189 --> 00:13:32,593
Everyone has a story,
everyone is a human being.

126
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:36,454
I think graffiti as a way of
talking to people.

127
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:40,001
And then there's a break through.

128
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,559
One day the guy sees
the wall all grey

129
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,634
and in the following
day it's colorful!

130
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:47,234
That's what's nice about it.

131
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:56,184
We're driving by when
we saw they had erased it.

132
00:13:56,352 --> 00:14:00,448
I think they finished erasing
right before we saw it.

133
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:03,123
It's shocking because you
get used to it, right?

134
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:07,092
So we thought, "Ok,
is it war you want?

135
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,231
Is that how it's gonna
be from now on?"

136
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:20,567
When you see they've
erased a graffiti you did down

137
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:23,604
there and another on the other
side of the city or avenue, ok...

138
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,675
But when they erase
a work like this,

139
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:28,141
this big! You feel you're
being persecuted.

140
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:31,911
You understand
this is serious stuff.

141
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,600
Where you see grey paint,
that's us.

142
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:59,113
He said: Just erase it!
I think this one is awful'

143
00:15:01,517 --> 00:15:03,678
We erased it.

144
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,480
- Do you know the schedule already?
- Fuck no!

145
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,626
Look, I'll erase all this,
you see?

146
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,033
A nice graffiti like
that one I'll leave be.

147
00:15:22,204 --> 00:15:24,468
The guys are improving
their jobs...

148
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,665
Not blurring anymore.

149
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,276
They're using more art, right?
After our combat,

150
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,579
they're using more art.

151
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:42,525
We're going to work
here all day and night

152
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,356
to be able to finish it
by tomorrow.

153
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,394
To deliver our work to the
population no later than tomorrow.

154
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,414
You pass by a place
for seven years

155
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:08,076
and see the same painting.

156
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:12,782
And suddenly one day you
see that one side of it is grey.

157
00:16:13,188 --> 00:16:20,151
It's like they'd taken off
apart your life.

158
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:24,366
The guys spent more than
a month to do the panel,

159
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:27,199
they spent more than six
months looking

160
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:30,406
for sponsorship to make it happen.

161
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,341
And due to an internal
bureaucracy,

162
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,640
a legal act, somebody
erased it, you know?

163
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:39,042
Man, we already lack
culture to keep erasing

164
00:16:39,181 --> 00:16:41,115
the culture in the streets.

165
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:45,253
I'm not talking about erasing
a letter, my name,

166
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:47,152
or somebody else's name.

167
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:49,689
We're talking about erasing
work of artists, you know?

168
00:16:53,729 --> 00:16:56,231
Every district has
a truck like this.

169
00:16:56,231 --> 00:16:58,495
Butanta have it,
Pinheiros have it...

170
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:01,228
If they painted like this one,
which looks nice,

171
00:17:01,303 --> 00:17:03,601
and not those black stuff.

172
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:07,374
This is very ugly,
don't you think? Look at it!

173
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:10,512
It's awful!

174
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:14,380
Awful. All smudged.
All messed up.

175
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,111
But there might have
some art in there;

176
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:19,448
maybe for an art curator,
this is beauty!

177
00:17:22,257 --> 00:17:24,657
"MUNICIPALITY ACTS WITH RIGOR
DUETO THE CLEAN CITY ACT

178
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,229
AGAINST VISUAL POLLUTION"

179
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:35,429
Look, I think it's a good thing!

180
00:17:35,504 --> 00:17:38,907
It was unbearable to see bigger
and bigger billboards in the city

181
00:17:38,907 --> 00:17:46,143
and live with all the excess of
logos and publicity.

182
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:50,113
I particularly like
the advertising displays,

183
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:54,880
because they give some information
about the moment they were

184
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:58,591
conceived, you know?
Even though it's advertising.

185
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:04,427
But now they have to
think how they're going to allow

186
00:18:04,566 --> 00:18:08,696
certain manifestations
to happen, such as graffiti;

187
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:13,637
because São Paulo is internationally
known by its graffiti.

188
00:18:14,243 --> 00:18:19,408
A lot of kids lost their graffiti
there, you know? With this act.

189
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:23,752
Look how nice, you see?
That's a beautiful work.

190
00:18:23,752 --> 00:18:25,310
I won't touch it.

191
00:18:25,387 --> 00:18:26,718
It's a work of culture, right?

192
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:27,914
Yeah.

193
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,426
How often do you do this job?

194
00:18:30,426 --> 00:18:32,656
Everyday, Monday to Friday.

195
00:18:32,828 --> 00:18:35,319
Everyday there's
something to be done.

196
00:18:41,303 --> 00:18:43,669
Do you think this is art?
That ain't art.

197
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:48,641
He didn't have the
right to cover in grey

198
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:52,235
only because there's an act...

199
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:55,306
Man, go ask the people what
they want first!

200
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:57,642
That was a mistake, for sure!

201
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,779
A work for which the artists
dedicated months to prepare...

202
00:19:01,857 --> 00:19:08,763
and it was great to the city!
I think 80% maybe 90%

203
00:19:08,864 --> 00:19:11,628
of the population
approved that graffiti.

204
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,463
The vast majority would definitely
approve to keep it there.

205
00:19:15,604 --> 00:19:17,970
What kind of criteria
they're using in order

206
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,968
to erase a work of
700 square meters?

207
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:26,248
It's pretty. Some are pretty
and we don't erase it.

208
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:31,481
We just erase the ugly ones.
The ugly ones we erase, right?

209
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:35,383
They hire an outsourced
company to cover the paintings,

210
00:19:35,557 --> 00:19:37,582
which evaluates and says
"erase here, erase there",

211
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:41,662
but the guys themselves don't
know what they re doing.

212
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:43,698
If the criteria are complex,

213
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:47,327
I think it's possible to
rethink these criteria.

214
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,631
Whoever is doing this job will
have a subjective standard.

215
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,367
If you chose to erase one
painting and leave another,

216
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:56,342
you're using a subjective
standard.

217
00:19:56,512 --> 00:20:00,482
Even if it were the league
of graffiti super heroes,

218
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:03,280
it would be a subjective
choice.

219
00:20:03,852 --> 00:20:09,958
Man's best friend, while it
doesn't know money, if it does...

220
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,394
Have you ever made any story
about dog pounds, man?

221
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:14,392
Nope.

222
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:21,069
If you go to "Zoonose" you will
see how the dog catchers work...

223
00:20:21,069 --> 00:20:23,799
That is cruel! Yeah,
I worked there for 8 years.

224
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:25,941
Which one are you going
to cover?

225
00:20:25,941 --> 00:20:28,910
We're going to cover this one
and leave this other as it is;

226
00:20:29,011 --> 00:20:33,004
this is no work of art...
it's useless.

227
00:20:33,882 --> 00:20:36,373
That one is out. Only
the one in the middle stays.

228
00:20:36,552 --> 00:20:39,043
Only this one stays.
This one I can't leave.

229
00:20:39,922 --> 00:20:44,018
We're keeping only this one.

230
00:20:44,092 --> 00:20:49,530
You think this is graffiti?
Do you find it pretty?

231
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:52,531
What do you think about
this? Tell me the truth,

232
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:53,969
do you think this is nice?

233
00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:56,802
If you don't offer
people what to see,

234
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,842
do not prevent them of what
they can see, you know?

235
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,444
They paint more often
during the weekends.

236
00:21:02,444 --> 00:21:05,902
Next week... Monday is a bank
holiday, so Tuesday... on Wednesday,

237
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:08,984
you'll go out there and
it's all painted back.

238
00:21:08,984 --> 00:21:09,973
And we cover again.

239
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:13,752
They should take this money
they re spending in grey paint

240
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,347
and use it to clean the rivers
or the culvert.

241
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,694
LUIS - We're going to defeat them
by fatigue, right?

242
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,559
They do graffiti and I'll go
there and cover it again.

243
00:21:20,729 --> 00:21:22,798
They won't endure.

244
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:24,766
At one time they'll give up...

245
00:21:24,766 --> 00:21:26,028
They'll have to spend
money on it.

246
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,871
Cause they have to buy
spray cans and stuff, right?

247
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,965
They'll paint and
we'll cover it...

248
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:32,840
That's it.

249
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:38,537
I was pissed off because
they had erased the wall

250
00:21:38,614 --> 00:21:40,377
and in the following day
a reporter called me up.

251
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:41,549
We don't know what happened,

252
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:42,615
but the graffiti is gone...

253
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,878
The Mayor will have
to apologize publicly.

254
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:48,548
So, after a week
or two in which the media

255
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:51,726
couldn't stop talking about it,
the City Hall called us.

256
00:21:51,827 --> 00:21:53,562
Maybe after a month.

257
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,759
Mayor Kassab himself called us,
and then the Secretary of Culture...

258
00:21:57,032 --> 00:22:00,468
The City Hall called the
artists and will let the wall

259
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:03,537
to be covered in graffiti again.

260
00:22:04,606 --> 00:22:10,442
"FOLHA DE S.PAULO"
CITY HALL ERASES ARTISTS
WALL BY MISTAKE®

261
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:15,615
I don't believe there's such
thing as a 700 m2 mistake!

262
00:22:15,784 --> 00:22:18,878
That doesn't exist.

263
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:21,820
I kept thinking about it,
you know?

264
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,127
I even thought for a moment:

265
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:30,861
"Damn, maybe they just missed
it and erased the wall, right?"

266
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:35,461
But damn, that's a huge mistake.
Beyond huge,

267
00:22:35,637 --> 00:22:39,698
just impossible to happen.

268
00:22:40,075 --> 00:22:42,543
We realized the
importance of that work

269
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:46,738
to the city. A lot of people
called us non conformist

270
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:50,018
about the deletion...
Everybody was talking about it...

271
00:22:50,018 --> 00:22:54,512
Now that the work is back,
you see people's reaction

272
00:22:54,823 --> 00:22:56,992
when they pass by. "Great
that you're doing it again!"

273
00:22:56,992 --> 00:22:59,460
"Congrats" or "Thanks" and
you see how important that is.

274
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:01,094
It means it already
belongs to the city.

275
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:02,928
One drawing completes
the other;

276
00:23:03,098 --> 00:23:07,535
the wall hasn't been finished,
but the drawings will unite...

277
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:10,572
see, the water in the background
goes till the end

278
00:23:10,572 --> 00:23:14,201
and suddenly a mountain appears...
everything is a single thing.

279
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:16,168
There are yet things to be drawn,
I'll draw something over

280
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:19,969
Nunca's and Osgemeos
will do the same...

281
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,015
CITY HALL AUTHORIZED THE
PAINTING OF THE NEW WALL,

282
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:25,882
BUT DECLINED TO AFFORD IT.

283
00:23:27,055 --> 00:23:30,149
THE COMMERCIAL
ASSOCIATION OF SÃO PAULO

284
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,858
SPONSORED THE WORK.

285
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:39,990
THE GRAFFITI ARTISTS HAD
15 DAYS TO COMPLETE THE JOB.

286
00:24:17,572 --> 00:24:19,540
Have you got any black?

287
00:24:19,641 --> 00:24:22,872
- Yeap, but I'll use it.
- You'll use it?

288
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:47,166
I think it's great they
get the opportunity

289
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:50,672
to show their work in a
bigger scale, you know?

290
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:54,301
For the first time they're
doing a work this big.

291
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:56,700
It's good for their work,
you know?

292
00:24:56,812 --> 00:25:00,771
To break down some barriers that
might yet exist; such as how to fit

293
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:04,749
their drawing in a particular
theme that we'd like;

294
00:25:04,853 --> 00:25:07,219
how to fit in with Nunca's
or Nina's ideas, you know?

295
00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:11,120
You see, nowadays they're
the guys who do more graffiti

296
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:16,855
in São Paulo.
They're every where.

297
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:21,200
We invited them to
be part of this work,

298
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:23,099
because they have
a very good style.

299
00:25:23,238 --> 00:25:28,175
It's a new generation and they
worry about defending a style,

300
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:30,803
you know? They have they're
own style.

301
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:34,713
They are the new generation
and they're absorbing what's

302
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,579
been happening nowadays. ..

303
00:25:37,385 --> 00:25:41,219
It's nice to be together,
develop the work together,

304
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:47,028
get to know how each one of us
develop the whole thing, you know?

305
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:50,327
Where all these references
come from. It's nice.

306
00:25:58,006 --> 00:25:59,598
Now, this will take long...

307
00:25:59,774 --> 00:26:00,741
"Treas" (trees).

308
00:26:00,909 --> 00:26:03,901
"Treas" (trees).

309
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:18,727
Graffiti has its own culture,
of joining people,

310
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:20,662
the gang painting
together, you know?

311
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,994
We've known each
other for many years,

312
00:26:23,131 --> 00:26:27,329
we like each other and we
always want to paint together.

313
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:34,340
If you are an artist that
comes from this environment,

314
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:38,276
you're different from an artist
that learned about art

315
00:26:38,446 --> 00:26:45,113
in the university and
knows all about art history.

316
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:50,291
Graffiti has its own university,
that has no tuition

317
00:26:50,425 --> 00:26:55,226
and anyone can do.

318
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:58,695
Being on the streets all the time,

319
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:05,671
let you more prepared
and less spoilt.

320
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:13,910
Today is gone, the rain will
stop at 8 o'clock at night.

321
00:27:20,822 --> 00:27:23,382
Annoying not to have beige
to finish it all there.

322
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:24,924
Do that small part over
there, man!

323
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,722
Then you come back here.

324
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:34,300
Fuck, man! Hard life, man!

325
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,779
And you know what? There's
no power here, bro.

326
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:45,404
The battery?

327
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,077
Yeah, the battery is dead.

328
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,080
No, man! They should have
switched off down there.

329
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,310
Figo! (FINOK)

330
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:52,988
Bro, the battery is gone.

331
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:54,819
No, it doesn't, is switched off.

332
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,016
Pull the yellow button.
The red one...

333
00:27:57,125 --> 00:28:00,528
Yeah, this one, now turn it on.
The machine is off.

334
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:01,825
The battery is dead!

335
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:04,261
No, it's not! The machine is
off, that's all.

336
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:06,766
Turn the machine on...

337
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:07,892
It's off, I told you.

338
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:14,898
That's it, the battery is dead.

339
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:20,073
Wow, wow! How stupid
can you be?! You Jerk!

340
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:21,978
You eat shit!
I can't believe it.

341
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,981
Just lower us down, sorry.

342
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:24,949
Really?

343
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,782
Take all the paint from here.

344
00:28:28,857 --> 00:28:30,085
Watch your head!

345
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:36,830
Tell the guys to take the
cars away.

346
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:45,266
Hey Claudio (ISE)! Move your car!
Hey Gustavo! Gustavo,

347
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:48,870
take the car away.

348
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,418
This is mine.

349
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,079
Fuck it.

350
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:03,818
The man who is jealous of
Osgemeos has just arrived.

351
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,086
I don't need this,
cause Osgemeos is weak.

352
00:29:07,262 --> 00:29:09,093
He copies all Osgemeos' ideas.

353
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:14,429
Osgemeos is weak;
Osgemeos envy Nunca!

354
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:17,835
Be careful there, man!

355
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:23,466
Osgemeos made a letter to Nunca...
down there.

356
00:29:24,879 --> 00:29:27,973
Made to Nunca because
Osgemeos copies Nunca.

357
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:30,945
Go finish it for once!

358
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,389
I've got to know
that a guy named Pepeu,

359
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:38,155
sings a rap much better than
I do... talking about combat,

360
00:29:38,326 --> 00:29:42,558
let's battle, I'm just waiting
for you to come up.

361
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,350
Bro, I think that was
the first rap song

362
00:30:06,421 --> 00:30:08,184
I've ever heard in my life.

363
00:30:14,496 --> 00:30:18,166
I'm Otavio, from Osgemeos,
we started attending

364
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:25,572
"São Bento" around 85, 86,
we're just kids...

365
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:30,170
And I believe it represented
to us what we are today.

366
00:30:31,546 --> 00:30:34,447
The hip hop movement
unites four cultures,

367
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:40,577
in music: rap; in dance,
breakdance; in pickups: DJ.

368
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:43,419
And, the writers: graffiti.

369
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:46,891
Indeed, every thing
that we've learned

370
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:52,431
so far about hip hop,
we learned there.

371
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:55,059
There was a guy
from the north who had an info

372
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:58,230
that a guy from the South didn't
have, but who would bring

373
00:30:58,306 --> 00:31:00,001
another info;
so everyone exchanged infos.

374
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:06,080
Thaide, DJ Hum, all this
generation... even Racionais,

375
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,412
KLJ... KLJ used
to breakdance.

376
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:14,180
All that generation came from
there, where everything started.

377
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:21,485
We also breakdanced a bit, but
then we decided to go for graffiti.

378
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,561
I was the one
who used to take

379
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,465
them to breakdance at
"São Bento".

380
00:31:27,602 --> 00:31:32,005
But I never joined them while
they're painting trains.

381
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:36,976
Train wagons, or unauthorized
walls. I never did it...

382
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:39,477
And I used to tell them:
"Take care,

383
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:42,708
cause if the police catches
you, this is your problem."

384
00:31:43,117 --> 00:31:45,051
Oh, yes, I warned them.

385
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:48,715
In 86, 87 we would paint exactly

386
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,617
what the Americans painted...

387
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,395
The ideal style and
competing for the best style

388
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,432
is the key to all
forms of rocking.

389
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:03,030
For the rap MC it's
rocking the mic.

390
00:32:03,238 --> 00:32:06,674
For the b-boys it's rocking
your body and breakdancing.

391
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:11,108
Or for writers, rocking the city
with your name on the train.

392
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:14,044
What we wanted to do?
Leave from it.

393
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:16,251
We have to respect it,
right?

394
00:32:16,251 --> 00:32:18,276
Where we were born, how we
were born, the old school,

395
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,718
but we have to keep
moving forward.

396
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:29,731
Everything that was to be
made related to graffiti,

397
00:32:29,731 --> 00:32:35,033
related to the NY style,
the European style,

398
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:37,229
was already done.

399
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:45,002
And in Brazil, it seems we have
another life experience, right?

400
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:49,482
To have national and
cultural references.

401
00:32:51,586 --> 00:32:53,417
I actually think that
graffiti for us wasn't

402
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:57,185
from the São Bento times.
We learnt to draw there,

403
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,460
get in touch with the
culture and all...

404
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,693
We began to really paint graffiti
in the late 80's, early 90's.

405
00:33:05,733 --> 00:33:09,430
When we started to go
out to the streets,

406
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:14,269
when we wanted to occupy
the streets...

407
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:17,309
Quit drawing in t-shirts
and paper stuff

408
00:33:17,512 --> 00:33:19,503
and face the street
as a support.

409
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,205
To really discover São Paulo
through graffiti.

410
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:26,251
Then we really got to know São
Paulo, how's to walk in São Paulo,

411
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,254
how's to paint in São Paulo, how's
to hustle the police in São Paulo.

412
00:33:29,357 --> 00:33:30,722
Graffiti artists are
arrested in São Paulo

413
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:32,193
and will be sued.

414
00:33:32,193 --> 00:33:34,058
GRAFFITI ARTISTS WANT TO RECOVER
THE RAP PREHENDED GEAR.

415
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:36,229
CITY HALL IS REPRESSING
GRAFFITI ARTISTS AGAIN.

416
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:39,164
It was at that time
we met Binho and Speto,

417
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,359
who already did
graffiti back then.

418
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:43,738
It was a crew who did,
unwillingly,

419
00:33:43,738 --> 00:33:45,831
actually ignoring its
results...

420
00:33:46,207 --> 00:33:47,697
Vitche.

421
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,612
You know, we were doing
it for the love!

422
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,603
Speto is a guy that
always helped us,

423
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,817
meaning we always exchanged
lots of references.

424
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:59,617
He was one of the guys who
developed his style prematurely.

425
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,687
In 84/85, he already
had his style.

426
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:05,487
Damn! How this guy has got style?
It helped us develop ours.

427
00:34:06,894 --> 00:34:11,194
In 99, when we began to travel,
we already had our style,

428
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:15,370
and that's what we took abroad,
what we built here...

429
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,635
And that's where people got to
know us. "Wow, that's nice!"

430
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:24,545
came to us and asked:
"Man, that's not graffiti...

431
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:25,842
What is it that you're doing?"

432
00:34:25,913 --> 00:34:29,349
And we said "We come from a
place that has always been very

433
00:34:31,386 --> 00:34:32,876
We knew really few about it.

434
00:34:33,187 --> 00:34:36,384
The first time we saw
an American Fat Cap.

435
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:41,324
I think it was when Barry
came here and brought it.

436
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:45,362
Man, when we saw it, we said
"Damn! That's how you do it!"

437
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:47,261
Like, there's a cap that makes
a thick line and you make

438
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:48,868
a hair stroke, you know?

439
00:34:49,203 --> 00:34:52,172
I remember that Osgemeos
used to sell some caps that were...

440
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:53,465
They were so bad...

441
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:56,339
Deodorant cap,
or something like that...

442
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,206
That made a thick line,
you know?

443
00:34:58,312 --> 00:35:00,644
The guys invented
the Brazilian Fat Cap.

444
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:02,750
That's it, I bought
it once from them,

445
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:06,445
didn't like it and threw
it away, you know?

446
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:08,483
Due to the high
cost of spray paint,

447
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:11,259
we had to develop some
other way to paint,

448
00:35:11,259 --> 00:35:14,495
using latex first, as background,
then outline with spray,

449
00:35:14,495 --> 00:35:15,484
to make it cheaper.

450
00:35:15,563 --> 00:35:18,396
I remember the guys saying: "Man,
you use latex to paint graffiti?

451
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:19,498
What do you mean?"

452
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:21,467
I remember we going there
in the first years...

453
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:25,206
we entered in a hip hop shop,
a graffiti shop,

454
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,875
and there was a huge wall
filled with spray cans.

455
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,173
All colors, all brands,
all caps...

456
00:35:30,578 --> 00:35:33,479
Wow! Amazing, right?
They asked me what I wanted,

457
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:36,947
and I said: "One color and
a can of latex, and that's it!"

458
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:41,478
So it made Brazil, São Paulo,
which is the cradle of graffiti,

459
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,820
to have it's own identity,
and this identity made all

460
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:48,455
the difference abroad.

461
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,272
BRAZILIANS MODIFY TATE MODERN

462
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:21,329
I believe that all these
artists have a certain intimacy

463
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:25,288
with this wild environment
of the street, you know?

464
00:36:25,466 --> 00:36:29,871
For me, do this work at Tate is
like they had invited a cannibal

465
00:36:29,871 --> 00:36:34,968
to have a cup of tea, you know?

466
00:36:39,013 --> 00:36:42,005
I think it's what
each one think it is.

467
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:45,753
We did what we had in our minds,
which was our project.

468
00:36:45,753 --> 00:36:51,726
A naked masked character,
holding a lot of cameras...

469
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:54,786
Each one interprets the
way they feel like it.

470
00:36:54,996 --> 00:36:58,295
You know, it was really
a mind opening experience

471
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:01,765
to me to come to São Paulo and just
see what there are in the streets.

472
00:37:01,903 --> 00:37:04,705
I loved, I mean, what I was doing
when I was there in São Paulo,

473
00:37:04,705 --> 00:37:06,798
everyday, every
morning I'd wake up...

474
00:37:06,874 --> 00:37:10,444
I had lots of meetings
I was very busy,

475
00:37:10,444 --> 00:37:12,344
but every morning I'd
wake up seven o'clock,

476
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:15,416
and I'd just go for
really long walks.

477
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:20,581
Walk around the city, walk around
this... underneath the car motorways,

478
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:23,814
take a lot of photographs...
It was like heaven, it was amazing.

479
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:26,994
It was really to show me that
this art can be so important

480
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:29,564
and really inspiring.

481
00:37:29,564 --> 00:37:31,555
And I just thought "We have
to bring this to London".

482
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,331
And, you know, luckily I had
the opportunity to do that.

483
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:43,635
It's not graffiti anymore,
but at the same time,

484
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:47,872
the essence is from graffiti,
so it's hard to say

485
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:51,352
"you aren't graffiti
artists anymore." What is it?

486
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,622
Is this art? You can consider
it as contemporary art,

487
00:37:54,622 --> 00:37:59,821
but do you take
graffiti out o fit?

488
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:05,056
So I see this way, there's all
this graffiti essence,

489
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:07,896
but they are somewhere
else, beyond...

490
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:13,074
But it's hard to dissociate,
it's practically impossible,

491
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:16,043
this is graffiti, this
is in the streets, man.

492
00:39:26,747 --> 00:39:29,773
Very well, you're not...

493
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:38,481
Look out! Mobile Court of...

494
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,116
-Justice.
- Justice.

495
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:44,592
You're caught painting;
they put you in there,

496
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:47,964
judge you and take
you straight to jail.

497
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:49,592
Yeah, the thing is...

498
00:39:49,704 --> 00:39:51,103
- All very fast.
- Mobility.

499
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,167
Because the law in Brazil
works out fine.

500
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,003
U-hu!

501
00:39:56,243 --> 00:39:58,643
- Take out the car.
-What for?

502
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:00,808
Sol can put the cart
there, bro.

503
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,583
Weren't you
painting here?

504
00:40:02,583 --> 00:40:04,141
- No,
- cause the battery is dead.

505
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:08,114
This cart is a piece of shit.

506
00:40:24,605 --> 00:40:28,769
I started painting because
I liked to paint and

507
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:31,512
I keep up
because I like it.

508
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:38,247
I never thought of it "wow, this
will be my profession", you know?

509
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:43,524
But it was something I believed
that could make me happy,

510
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,082
while I was doing it.

511
00:40:46,727 --> 00:40:51,232
Like my mom, she always told me:
"l want you to be a doctor,

512
00:40:51,232 --> 00:40:59,867
a lawyer" to develop a
standardized work.

513
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:04,712
With time I made her
understand this,

514
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:09,843
and I think now she understands
a bit more like it.

515
00:41:10,017 --> 00:41:15,978
You can have an almost
self-sufficient work

516
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:21,662
without needing to work at a
company or firm and be a corporate

517
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:25,758
guy, you know?

518
00:41:25,933 --> 00:41:31,599
To feel complete, to be happy.

519
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:36,677
And today I live almost
exclusively from it,

520
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:40,204
from selling the
paintings I do.

521
00:41:40,347 --> 00:41:45,250
But when I cease to feel happy
with it, I'll do something else.

522
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:51,918
Or keep doing it and go
sell pizza, whatever.

523
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:55,958
That's not what
I wanna do, though.

524
00:42:01,969 --> 00:42:03,334
- You finished?
-No...

525
00:42:03,671 --> 00:42:05,969
I need the cart so I can
paint the character up there.

526
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,041
Will you do another one?

527
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:13,772
There's no red, right?
The big one.

528
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,246
What for?

529
00:42:16,383 --> 00:42:19,253
Don't you need it to cut
it there, on the hand?

530
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:21,847
I'll see if I find it.
Hold on.

531
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:28,719
Do you need more?

532
00:42:28,863 --> 00:42:30,262
Do you need more color?

533
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,890
Just that?

534
00:42:33,033 --> 00:42:35,297
Bro, the small cans they're
using to out line

535
00:42:35,669 --> 00:42:37,296
only come with this cap.

536
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:42,735
He doesn't think. He takes
one can, then goes up in the cart,

537
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,937
and then it runs out. Then
he comes down to get one more.

538
00:42:45,112 --> 00:42:47,706
Why doesn't he take all at once?

539
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:51,050
You're getting bold, huh?

540
00:42:51,185 --> 00:42:53,653
Till recently you wouldn't
climb up a stool to get cookies

541
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:57,213
in the closet. Now you're
hanging from the crane.

542
00:42:58,092 --> 00:43:00,194
You need to use a
ladder there, right?

543
00:43:00,194 --> 00:43:01,855
There's noway to get
down from here,

544
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:03,189
not even if I was Kiko's size.

545
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:07,923
Motherfucker! I'll fall
because of you!

546
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:15,042
Should I erase it, Figo? Just
leave the yellow rays, right?

547
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:19,979
To shorten it, right?
Ready! Here you are.

548
00:43:20,114 --> 00:43:21,916
It's fucking great. All your
drawings look like letters.

549
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,941
Look at this bird's beak, bro.

550
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:28,787
Coyo! Let's go
do one over there?

551
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,216
What was that? Do one
there? I'm going too.

552
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:35,353
You're painting, man.
You can't.

553
00:43:37,464 --> 00:43:41,127
- Where's 2&?
-Who? Zefix?

554
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:45,265
Wow! Go figure.

555
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,237
We've fucking painted there
already... lots of times.

556
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,375
Down there?

557
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,206
Ah, there... damn, it's true!
Shall we go there?

558
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:57,810
- Let's? Everybody doing a throw.
- A throw! Hey nigga!

559
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,780
I'll be right back.

560
00:44:02,957 --> 00:44:03,821
Aren't you going?

561
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:05,015
No, I'll keep looking
the stuff that...

562
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:07,354
So lend me the...
that cap, then.

563
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:10,127
The American fat cap?
Here you are.

564
00:44:10,297 --> 00:44:12,765
- No, no, no, the...
-Claudio has it.

565
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,768
- Do you have it?
-No.

566
00:44:14,768 --> 00:44:18,795
Fuck off! C'mon now. Oh, you'll
give me the bad one, bro?

567
00:44:18,973 --> 00:44:19,962
This one is good!

568
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:21,699
Then you use it...
let me use the other one.

569
00:44:21,842 --> 00:44:22,934
Ok.

570
00:44:24,878 --> 00:44:25,845
Where is it? Down here?

571
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,345
Just around the corner.
It's a cool spot.

572
00:44:27,848 --> 00:44:28,849
But will it stay?

573
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:31,875
Ah, we've painted that wall
about 600 times.

574
00:44:32,019 --> 00:44:34,078
- One more...
- One more, one less...

575
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:43,192
What's your limit?
Here? Up to where?

576
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:50,799
Wow, motherfucker! Doing it
in fluorescent green.

577
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,269
Look at the color he's painting.

578
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,878
When you do a
throw up like this,

579
00:44:57,878 --> 00:45:01,370
it's like when you press
the fuck off key, you know?

580
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:07,448
When you're with your friends,
one support search other,

581
00:45:07,821 --> 00:45:08,480
you know?

582
00:45:08,856 --> 00:45:12,019
Like "Yeah, right! People
don't like it, but fuck off!

583
00:45:12,226 --> 00:45:16,060
I'm here with my friends and
we like to do it and that's it!"

584
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,192
And we do it.

585
00:45:18,265 --> 00:45:20,790
When you go out just to do it,
your vibe is different, you know?

586
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:23,425
You don't mind the consequences,
you just wanna do it.

587
00:45:23,937 --> 00:45:25,996
Like beginning, middle
and end, you know?

588
00:45:26,073 --> 00:45:27,768
You just wanna finish
what you started.

589
00:45:28,108 --> 00:45:31,202
Throw up for those who
don't like it, it's ugly.

590
00:45:31,378 --> 00:45:33,209
It's my favorite.

591
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:36,916
The moment you're there, painting,

592
00:45:37,084 --> 00:45:39,951
you're there, painting.
You're thinking about nothing.

593
00:45:40,387 --> 00:45:41,945
It's really thinking
about nothing, you know?

594
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:44,556
It's your therapy moment.

595
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,860
But that's very personal.
That's how it works for us.

596
00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:51,497
I may be going down a hill,
whatever.

597
00:45:51,865 --> 00:45:54,101
The paint goes out the can
and reaches the wall,

598
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:56,296
that's it. It's automatic,
you know?

599
00:45:57,938 --> 00:46:00,236
Here, I've got black.

600
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:03,910
The best thing bout graffiti
is that it drives

601
00:46:04,078 --> 00:46:06,569
you from hate to
love very quickly.

602
00:46:06,914 --> 00:46:08,949
You start painting smoothly,
you know?

603
00:46:08,949 --> 00:46:11,349
Suddenly you feel hate and start
panting fast, and then you feel ok,

604
00:46:11,485 --> 00:46:14,045
cause it just relaxed you,
and you paints lowly.

605
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:16,357
There's nothing like
graffiti for those who like

606
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:19,986
graffiti, only sex. It's the only
thing that resembles it, you know?

607
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:23,864
Imagine you having a
10-minute orgasm.

608
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,389
It's the same. It's
the same feeling.

609
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:32,096
You're painting a 700m2 wall,
but from 3 to 3 hours

610
00:46:32,172 --> 00:46:36,609
I see you guys crazy to paint
something under the bridge.

611
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,846
Explain to me. Doesn't
this satisfy you?

612
00:46:41,915 --> 00:46:45,009
I don't know, maybe not,
right? I don't think so.

613
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:49,451
There's always this will to
reach a different place,

614
00:46:49,623 --> 00:46:53,252
anew place, you know?
To really tag it, you know?

615
00:46:54,194 --> 00:46:56,128
And these are completely
different things.

616
00:46:56,296 --> 00:47:01,893
This is a sponsored wall,
everyone is earning some money,

617
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:06,372
and you have time to think.

618
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,100
You scribble, come back,
look at it, approach,

619
00:47:09,276 --> 00:47:11,267
and scribble again, you know?

620
00:47:11,512 --> 00:47:13,605
I think that if you grab some cans
and go out to the streets

621
00:47:14,014 --> 00:47:18,218
to "pichar" or do whatever.

622
00:47:18,218 --> 00:47:24,316
It's another dynamic,
it's other... it's something else.

623
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:26,990
The difference is the following.

624
00:47:27,161 --> 00:47:32,933
These is permitted, those are not.
But what's the limit, you know?

625
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:36,425
For us it is!
We're part of the city.

626
00:47:39,173 --> 00:47:41,107
And this is graffiti, right?

627
00:47:41,175 --> 00:47:43,643
The fact that you write down your
name, "it's my name over there!"

628
00:47:44,044 --> 00:47:45,238
Messes a lot with people's ego.

629
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:46,471
"You went there and wrote
Osgemeos, so what?"

630
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,612
We sure did! That's our name.

631
00:47:47,714 --> 00:47:51,343
You'll pass by and will read
"Gemeos". One more, you know?

632
00:47:53,086 --> 00:47:55,350
You wrote your name or drew

633
00:47:55,422 --> 00:47:59,059
something that people
recognize as your work.

634
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:02,153
What's the difference? Both
interfere in a place you don't own.

635
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:04,197
And if you don't own it,
it's self-promotion.

636
00:48:04,331 --> 00:48:07,232
Both are self-promotion, the
only difference is the technique.

637
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:11,371
I think that every
time a guy goes out

638
00:48:11,371 --> 00:48:19,369
to paint someone's wall he
says "never" to a private place.

639
00:48:20,047 --> 00:48:22,675
He starts breaking a rule.

640
00:48:24,351 --> 00:48:28,048
I don't think São Paulo
deserves graffiti's best.

641
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:30,588
You'll have to do it
and fuck off.

642
00:48:30,757 --> 00:48:35,160
I think every
big city is like this.

643
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,661
The stuff these guys do,
a wall like this,

644
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:43,637
São Paulo do not deserve it.

645
00:48:43,637 --> 00:48:46,401
It's too pretty to
São Paulo, you know?

646
00:48:46,573 --> 00:48:49,009
The city don't give
you back such quality.

647
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,546
The guys offer a fucking great
job, and the city wastes it,

648
00:48:52,546 --> 00:48:55,037
you know? People erase it.

649
00:48:55,249 --> 00:48:59,583
Then they only order to remake it
because the news brought it up,

650
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,550
you know?

651
00:49:00,754 --> 00:49:02,312
Nobody cares spontaneously.

652
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:05,222
People only care if there's some
trouble behind it, you know?

653
00:49:25,746 --> 00:49:27,179
This one I need a permission,
cause it belongs

654
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:28,407
to the construction site,
you know what I mean?

655
00:49:28,482 --> 00:49:29,506
We can't erase that one,
right, man?

656
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,413
- No, this one is gone.
-This one?

657
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:32,576
- Yeah.
- Not that one, right?

658
00:49:32,686 --> 00:49:33,710
Just the one on the top.

659
00:49:33,787 --> 00:49:35,355
Only the "Gemeos"
over there, written "Gemeos".

660
00:49:35,355 --> 00:49:36,356
Not the character.

661
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:38,225
The character is creative.

662
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,523
It's pretty! Nice, man!

663
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:42,288
I won't touch the
character, you see?

664
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:44,760
Only that one
on the top and this one here.

665
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:56,539
These guys want to leave
their names, right?

666
00:49:56,643 --> 00:49:58,474
But I'll erase the name.

667
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:01,511
It's not necessary to put
the name. Is it? It isn't.

668
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:04,050
There it is, it's pretty already.
Leave your brand.

669
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,344
If I was a "graffiti" writer
and only wrote my only name,

670
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,754
I'd take a ride with this
character.

671
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,086
I"d start putting my name from
here to there, see?

672
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:11,552
Like if I had done it.

673
00:50:11,725 --> 00:50:12,487
Meaning that you did the
character.

674
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,423
Of course!

675
00:50:13,694 --> 00:50:16,219
In my personal opinion
it's a culture.

676
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:19,788
If I was a pichador, I would
also do a character, like,

677
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:23,604
since there's a female,
I'd do a male.

678
00:50:23,604 --> 00:50:26,835
Asking for the spray can.
A mind, right?

679
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,669
I think their names
should be used only

680
00:50:31,878 --> 00:50:33,413
as a signature down there,
like they were...

681
00:50:33,413 --> 00:50:38,544
They'd even get more famous due to
their names, their phone number...

682
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,688
If some store, or firm, whatever,
needed their paintings

683
00:50:41,688 --> 00:50:48,821
to do an image for an ad,
they'd profit with it.

684
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:52,165
Not putting their names in
pichagao.

685
00:50:52,165 --> 00:50:54,793
Cause the guy should me, but you
saw, I already covered the feet.

686
00:50:54,868 --> 00:50:58,565
I paint it all!
I erase everything,

687
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:00,129
so I don't waste my time.

688
00:51:01,541 --> 00:51:03,771
Have you ever
touched a spray can?

689
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,775
Yeah, I painted
when I was younger.

690
00:51:05,846 --> 00:51:09,577
I've painted a lot. I climbed
up buildings to paint.

691
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,885
How many times the police
caught me with a spray can

692
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:14,187
and painted my hair,
all my body...

693
00:51:14,187 --> 00:51:15,848
they made fun of
us and everything.

694
00:51:15,922 --> 00:51:19,619
All police units that catch a
pichador do it. Paint them all.

695
00:51:20,293 --> 00:51:23,319
I've already heard of this
Osgemeos guys, they're from Lapa.

696
00:51:23,397 --> 00:51:26,233
But I have no contact with them.
Cause in the past,

697
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:30,203
Osgemeos was the name of a crew,
not because the guys are twins,

698
00:51:30,203 --> 00:51:32,339
it was the name of a team.
From then on,

699
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,172
the guys grew older, so other
people came on their place.

700
00:51:35,542 --> 00:51:38,773
Check this out. I erase it.

701
00:51:38,912 --> 00:51:42,683
My aim today is to erase it all.

702
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:45,550
Back in those days I was a brat
and didn't care bout anything.

703
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:48,587
I got high and had fun.

704
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,792
You'll have to apply
two layers.

705
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:54,352
Two to three layers to
cover this stuff.

706
00:51:56,329 --> 00:51:58,593
Damn, I don't know
if they're being so smart

707
00:51:58,665 --> 00:52:00,690
or so naive, for real.

708
00:52:00,834 --> 00:52:04,971
Damn, how are you gonna stop I
don't know how many million kids

709
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:08,771
from painting somewhere.

710
00:52:08,942 --> 00:52:14,281
If you gather all graffiti artists
and picho writers from São Paulo,

711
00:52:14,281 --> 00:52:17,307
I wouldn't say millions,
but a few thousand.

712
00:55:15,161 --> 00:55:16,753
They worked at a bank,
and they told me:

713
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:22,826
"Mom, were quitting work, because
we'll live out of drawing."

714
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:26,006
I almost freaked out, because
I always supported them,

715
00:55:26,006 --> 00:55:27,735
I thought everything
they did was fine.

716
00:55:32,812 --> 00:55:35,747
It's a symbiosis, right,
man? Their work is so crazy...

717
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:39,986
Gustavo started to draw,
then stopped and left.

718
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:42,819
Otéavio came and resumed drawing.

719
00:55:43,189 --> 00:55:51,153
Like he was Gustavo there...
no, no Gustavo... Gustavo!

720
00:55:59,506 --> 00:56:03,442
They never communicated orally.

721
00:56:03,677 --> 00:56:06,578
They always communicated
by telepathy.

722
00:56:06,646 --> 00:56:09,740
No need to speak, they
understood each other.

723
00:56:11,918 --> 00:56:15,479
It's very... Wow,
check out that nice car!

724
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:17,616
Awesome, huh?

725
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:21,792
They're 2, but they've got
an entity,

726
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,897
but of course, the entity
Osgemeos,

727
00:56:23,897 --> 00:56:26,991
it seems you're talking to one
person that discusses

728
00:56:27,167 --> 00:56:31,871
their own ideas, cause
they discuss between them,

729
00:56:31,871 --> 00:56:35,705
but actually they re discussing
Osgemeos' ideas.

730
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:37,068
Damn, where did you
take that from?

731
00:56:37,243 --> 00:56:39,211
People who never heard of
Brazil, really, you know?

732
00:56:39,579 --> 00:56:41,604
Is there graffiti in Brazil?

733
00:56:41,748 --> 00:56:44,114
São Paulo? Where's São Paulo?
In Argentina? You know?

734
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:47,083
- We heard those questions.
-That's crazy.

735
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,511
Buenos Aires...

736
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:50,016
Yeah, it's so ridiculous.

737
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:53,522
But it was nice, because we gave
the opportunity to people know

738
00:56:53,593 --> 00:56:56,585
what happened, you know?
Down there.

739
00:57:02,969 --> 00:57:05,938
People thought they
were delinquents.

740
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:09,164
Cause graffiti was always
considered something de classed,

741
00:57:09,609 --> 00:57:13,045
you know? From delinquent people...

742
00:57:13,113 --> 00:57:17,117
So they were never considered
artists, and it took very long,

743
00:57:17,117 --> 00:57:20,575
only when they started
to travel abroad.

744
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:32,055
It comes from (Secretary)
Andrea Matarazzo.

745
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:35,690
From the Mayor, Clean City Act,
put an end to "picho"

746
00:57:35,902 --> 00:57:37,062
and "graffiti" in São Paulo.

747
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:40,628
They want it to be done right, you
know? But it's a complicated issue.

748
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:43,777
It's a brown wrapper,
but we need to keep going.

749
00:57:43,777 --> 00:57:45,904
They paint, we cover,
they paint we cover.

750
00:57:46,913 --> 00:57:48,608
"LOOK! THEY ARE BACK AGAIN!"

751
00:57:48,815 --> 00:57:51,841
"YOUR MONEY SPENT IN GREY PAINT!"

752
00:57:52,152 --> 00:57:55,610
"THE POLITICIANS ARE FOOLING YOW!

753
00:57:55,822 --> 00:58:00,020
You agree 100% with
your boss' criteria?

754
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:04,053
Look, I think City
Hall's work is nice, ok?

755
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,791
I think it's a well-done job.

756
00:58:05,965 --> 00:58:08,525
I agree 100% with
the City Hall in this work.

757
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:14,105
I'd agree 89,99%.

758
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:23,715
Here you still see
things like this wall,

759
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:26,842
erased for no reason.

760
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,956
People in Germany were horrified
when they heard something

761
00:58:29,956 --> 00:58:33,153
this size was erased.

762
00:58:34,027 --> 00:58:38,623
So here it is still difficult
to consider this as art.

763
00:58:38,698 --> 00:58:43,870
Because they come to see it,
but keep chasing for drug addicts,

764
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:47,806
or if the boys don't get inspired
by snorting something.

765
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:53,046
People ask: "But don't
you... nothing?" None.

766
00:58:53,046 --> 00:58:55,810
They don't drink, don't
smoke, nothing.

767
00:58:56,316 --> 00:58:59,046
They always say:
"My drug is to paint."

768
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,351
That's it. To snort
paint non-stop.

769
00:59:07,093 --> 00:59:10,797
The issue of
international recognition

770
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:13,027
as a necessity to validate
things in Brazil

771
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:14,997
happens in everything, right?

772
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:20,368
It's not a phenomenon
confined to contemporary art.

773
00:59:20,673 --> 00:59:24,277
It took us almost 20
years since we began to like

774
00:59:24,277 --> 00:59:26,279
graffiti until we could get
to travel and meet

775
00:59:26,279 --> 00:59:29,146
other graffiti artists
and other cultures.

776
00:59:29,282 --> 00:59:31,842
And in this period
we've stayed there,

777
00:59:31,918 --> 00:59:33,886
sometimes with very
few information,

778
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,357
we ended up creating
another language of painting,

779
00:59:37,357 --> 00:59:39,348
and we brought it
with us when came here.

780
00:59:39,425 --> 00:59:44,364
I think it happens in all
other cultural fields,

781
00:59:44,364 --> 00:59:51,304
due to a colonial mentality
of consuming imported things.

782
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:55,297
Then the culture from abroad
ends up bringing

783
00:59:55,375 --> 00:59:59,175
back Brazilian culture.

784
00:59:59,445 --> 01:00:03,683
I think it's alack of
self confidence, you know?

785
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:11,647
To say "Damn, this is good!" We
don't need a stamp from outside.

786
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,962
You see, I just paint
authorized by dweller.

787
01:00:25,305 --> 01:00:27,136
Check that out. You think that
stuff is pretty?

788
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,435
That's just awful.

789
01:00:28,775 --> 01:00:31,811
Let's stop by this wall and
ask if the guy authorizes.

790
01:00:31,811 --> 01:00:33,403
If he does, I'll
cover it. Hold on.

791
01:00:33,813 --> 01:00:35,747
I need permission
to paint that wall,

792
01:00:35,815 --> 01:00:37,680
and need to talk to the person
in charge.

793
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:40,086
We're from the City Hall,
no cost. City Hall.

794
01:00:40,086 --> 01:00:41,451
It's that color over there,
the grey color.

795
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,150
It'll look much prettier.

796
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:46,156
I see. But I can't authorize,

797
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:48,327
because it doesn't
belong to us.

798
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,952
Where is the entrance?

799
01:00:53,766 --> 01:00:54,734
Good morning.

800
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,065
Good morning.
It's the City Hall.

801
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,737
I"d like to speak to the
person in charge.

802
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:01,696
The wall around the block
is yours, right?

803
01:01:03,209 --> 01:01:05,234
Can I paint it? Thanks!

804
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,845
I pass by everyday,
and I find it pretty,

805
01:01:10,984 --> 01:01:12,385
but then it was being erased.

806
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:14,046
I find it a great pity.

807
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,449
But I believe that's
the more discussion.

808
01:01:16,823 --> 01:01:20,193
To wonder what is art
and what isn't.

809
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:22,286
This is an important
issue now a days.

810
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:26,091
Ok.

811
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:30,032
People look this way,
it's a matter of taste, right?

812
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:32,799
A matter of taste.

813
01:01:33,139 --> 01:01:36,370
You heard what she said, right?
She thinks this is not good.

814
01:01:36,542 --> 01:01:38,237
She doesn't like it.

815
01:01:38,411 --> 01:01:40,242
Each one has an opinion, right?
She doesn't like it either,

816
01:01:40,413 --> 01:01:43,507
just like us. She thinks it's ugly
graffiti. What she said?

817
01:01:43,883 --> 01:01:44,440
What?

818
01:01:44,550 --> 01:01:46,450
She said it's ugly
graffiti, right?

819
01:01:46,552 --> 01:01:47,985
- That's right.
- Was that or not?

820
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,146
No. She said she
liked the painting, right?

821
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:57,458
But it's a matter of...
It was authorized.

822
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,095
What's going on now is
the following:

823
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,325
There will be an official
graffiti,

824
01:02:02,568 --> 01:02:04,798
which is where the City Hall
allow site,

825
01:02:04,871 --> 01:02:07,974
and there'll still be
the unofficial, the always...

826
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:10,576
These guys started like this,
actually. Doing it.

827
01:02:10,576 --> 01:02:12,942
Because graffiti wasn't
allowed!

828
01:02:13,112 --> 01:02:18,484
Thus, you can't intervene
anywhere in the city.

829
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:23,512
City Hall is now permitting
interventions and is studying

830
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:27,293
to allow it in certain places.
All right. Is that official?

831
01:02:27,293 --> 01:02:31,389
Yes. We'll have the official
graffiti artists, but look,

832
01:02:31,464 --> 01:02:33,932
street art was born as
a transgression.

833
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:38,471
So those who really want to do
graffiti and "picho"

834
01:02:38,471 --> 01:02:41,304
will just keep doing it.

835
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:53,219
We were up there and
Gustavo asked me:

836
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:55,881
"Do donkeys have hair?"

837
01:02:56,055 --> 01:02:57,420
What did he mean?

838
01:02:57,623 --> 01:03:00,251
He's drawing
a donkey over there.

839
01:03:00,393 --> 01:03:04,124
He asked while he was doing it.

840
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,296
That's crazy.
What did you tell him?

841
01:03:08,434 --> 01:03:11,892
I said: "A jackass does!"

842
01:03:12,505 --> 01:03:15,065
I think he asked to the
right person.

843
01:03:23,449 --> 01:03:27,545
Yeah, when I started at the City
Hall, I had hair.

844
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,851
But now... I'd like
you to film my pay slip.

845
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,620
It would be nice to take a
picture in front of the politician

846
01:04:06,058 --> 01:04:08,959
over there, the... A lot of
people passed by and asked:

847
01:04:09,128 --> 01:04:13,292
"ls it Kassab over there?"
"ls it the Mayor?"

848
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:16,163
And I'm like: "No, it ain't."

849
01:04:17,703 --> 01:04:22,140
But he's got bright eyes, huh?
Just like the Mayor (Kassab).

850
01:04:22,241 --> 01:04:26,507
It's coincidence.
It" wasn't intentional.

851
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:34,053
They're worried with
something they shouldn't, right?

852
01:04:34,053 --> 01:04:36,681
It's not a problem to the city,
but a solution.

853
01:04:37,056 --> 01:04:38,990
It's sad because it's not just
with this work.

854
01:04:39,058 --> 01:04:40,491
There are thousands
of other works,

855
01:04:40,593 --> 01:04:42,993
from other artists, right?

856
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:46,629
They suffer from it as well.
Not just us, not just our crew,

857
01:04:46,732 --> 01:04:49,064
but also everyone in São Paulo.

858
01:04:49,202 --> 01:04:52,569
The guy leaves the periphery to
paint in the city, or whatever,

859
01:04:52,705 --> 01:04:56,209
he comes from the countryside
and he suffers from it.

860
01:04:56,209 --> 01:05:00,669
He saves some money, buys his
cans, do a nice piece of work

861
01:05:00,746 --> 01:05:03,716
somewhere and suddenly he has no
time to take a picture of it.

862
01:05:03,716 --> 01:05:06,184
It's like pruning the guy's dream.

863
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:10,215
That's why we need to
struggle to keep it.

864
01:05:10,356 --> 01:05:14,554
We can't lose it. It's
São Paulo's main feature.

865
01:05:14,627 --> 01:05:19,131
The graffiti on the streets.
People like graffiti.

866
01:05:19,131 --> 01:05:24,728
If we stop painting every where
and just paint where it's allowed,

867
01:05:25,071 --> 01:05:26,470
that's it, we'll
lose it, you know?

868
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:30,370
We must fight to paint everywhere,
to avoid losing something

869
01:05:30,443 --> 01:05:33,571
so São Paulo like.
Paint everywhere.

870
01:06:03,342 --> 01:06:08,370
WALL INAUGURATION DAY
1212112008

871
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:23,018
This is the deal: The Mayor has to
come inaugurate the wall, right?

872
01:06:23,195 --> 01:06:28,758
We're in his city, right? Somehow
he take care of all this.

873
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:32,633
Before he became Mayor,
the wall was already here.

874
01:06:32,705 --> 01:06:36,402
And that was authorized and
sponsored as well.

875
01:06:39,445 --> 01:06:43,482
But that's it. He does
his part we do ours.

876
01:06:43,482 --> 01:06:46,747
Not just here, but all
around the city.

877
01:07:14,213 --> 01:07:17,740
We hope it stays now, right?

878
01:07:17,817 --> 01:07:23,778
That this put an end.
We believe it will end.

879
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:26,852
That's what we felt, you know?

880
01:07:27,226 --> 01:07:28,784
This experience with the City
Hall, you know?

881
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:33,599
I think if they had criteria to
take the billboards from a 1920

882
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:38,764
building's, I think this deserves
to be considered as well.

883
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:42,835
I mean, this is even more explicit.

884
01:07:43,209 --> 01:07:45,473
Yeah, if a castle in
Scotland recognizes our work,

885
01:07:45,544 --> 01:07:48,308
why won't they do it here, right?

886
01:07:48,514 --> 01:07:51,317
So I think this was an alert,
a start, you know?

887
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:54,650
"Wait a minute, let me pay
attention to this." You know?

888
01:08:01,827 --> 01:08:03,590
How'd that happen?

889
01:08:03,796 --> 01:08:05,627
I was playing football.

890
01:08:08,601 --> 01:08:10,432
That's nice, cool.
It is very beautiful.

891
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,836
The City Hall authorized it,

892
01:08:13,939 --> 01:08:18,399
and this wall will be declared
as a historical landmark.

893
01:08:18,477 --> 01:08:21,207
So he told me while he was
putting the plaster:

894
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:26,352
"Now that I painted the wall, I'll
be famous, my name will be known,

895
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:31,346
because I painted with the top
of the graffiti artists.

896
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:35,889
I think the Mayor will come
over to see what we've painted.

897
01:08:36,262 --> 01:08:40,528
Actually he'll apologize
publicly, right?

898
01:08:40,833 --> 01:08:44,792
He'll apologize in front
of everybody.

899
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,729
Nice, huh? Noble act.

900
01:08:49,508 --> 01:08:51,533
-It's the least.
-The least.

901
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,878
- The Mayor is coming!
- It seems he actually arrived!

902
01:08:56,248 --> 01:08:58,546
He arrived, so we'll see him
and I talk to you later.

903
01:09:10,863 --> 01:09:12,592
- Looks pretty, huh?
- Looks pretty.

904
01:09:12,765 --> 01:09:15,825
Looks really pretty,
right? It's beautiful!

905
01:09:16,502 --> 01:09:19,471
This is the group of artists...

906
01:09:19,705 --> 01:09:23,334
- Hey!
- Good morning! Thank you.

907
01:09:23,476 --> 01:09:26,309
- How is it going?
- Hello.

908
01:09:26,445 --> 01:09:29,278
How're you doing?

909
01:09:29,515 --> 01:09:31,415
Delivered back to town,
right?

910
01:09:31,817 --> 01:09:33,717
That's right.
With the Mayor,

911
01:09:33,886 --> 01:09:35,444
the city will be clean
and pretty.

912
01:09:35,521 --> 01:09:37,352
Clean and beautiful.

913
01:09:37,456 --> 01:09:40,687
- We appreciate.
- And with more graffiti!

914
01:09:40,793 --> 01:09:43,529
That's it. More graffiti.
Everywhere there's...

915
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:46,623
It was nice to bring it back.

916
01:09:50,636 --> 01:09:52,297
The city is to be congratulated
it has changed.

917
01:09:52,505 --> 01:09:54,735
It's getting better and better.
Really,

918
01:09:54,874 --> 01:09:58,776
it's a God's blessing.
You are a blessing.

919
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:00,606
It's amazing to see the reaction
of the people when they pass by.

920
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,270
Is it?

921
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:08,648
Please guys look at me
down here.

922
01:10:08,821 --> 01:10:13,485
Just for the records,
this is a symbolic act,

923
01:10:13,559 --> 01:10:16,926
because we wanted to do it here
so it's with the presence of the

924
01:10:16,996 --> 01:10:20,955
media, the Commercial Association,
the Mayor, Dom Fernando...

925
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,791
We didn't call the population
to avoid disturbance,

926
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:25,459
it is even dangerous, and
there could be an accident.

927
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:28,936
The media will reverberate
so the society can acknowledge

928
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,708
this inauguration, from
the symbolic point of view.

929
01:10:32,912 --> 01:10:38,009
So we want to ask for a blessing
to those who worked here...

930
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:44,050
we know that the art always
involves harmony,

931
01:10:44,423 --> 01:10:47,827
integrity and unity.

932
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:52,662
Hence, if we take something
or put something,

933
01:10:52,731 --> 01:10:56,189
it's not possible,
because it's a work of art.

934
01:10:57,369 --> 01:11:03,475
A work of art, in an important
place... a work that is...

935
01:11:03,475 --> 01:11:09,014
was erased by mistake
several months ago.

936
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:11,847
But the Commercial Association
understood the relevance

937
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:15,783
of this artist's work for
São Paulo, and gave an important

938
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:18,724
step toward such recognition, and
this present to São Paulo.

939
01:11:18,724 --> 01:11:22,387
It's a big city, a city that
need to live with culture,

940
01:11:22,561 --> 01:11:24,129
with art, generate jobs.

941
01:11:24,129 --> 01:11:27,826
There's no more risk of
erasing it again, right, Mayor?

942
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:29,490
I hope not.

943
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:34,635
It's obvious that after
all the media coverage over it,

944
01:11:34,707 --> 01:11:37,835
the Mayor went there and
recognized the mistake and:

945
01:11:37,977 --> 01:11:41,936
"C'mon, let's undo the mistake."

946
01:11:42,147 --> 01:11:44,115
But what about the other paintings
from the other guys, man?

947
01:11:44,516 --> 01:11:45,949
What about all the history
that was erased?

948
01:11:46,151 --> 01:11:49,450
The graffiti artists themselves
are here, right? Behind you,

949
01:11:49,622 --> 01:11:53,023
they know that this action
isn't normal in São Paulo.

950
01:11:53,125 --> 01:11:55,753
On the contrary. The graffiti
works have been very well

951
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:57,556
respected and admired in
the city of São Paulo,

952
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,528
and mainly because of our
management.

953
01:12:00,633 --> 01:12:01,827
And we intend to keep it this way.

954
01:12:03,435 --> 01:12:06,893
Mr. Mayor, you mentioned
that erasing the wall

955
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:10,975
was a mistake. Isn't a 700m2
mistake as this wall deletion

956
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:13,636
quite curious?

957
01:12:13,812 --> 01:12:16,679
The investigation procedures
are being coordinated

958
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:19,115
by the Districts Office,

959
01:12:19,184 --> 01:12:22,517
that will have all the available
information for you.

960
01:12:25,858 --> 01:12:28,122
- They have no schedule!
- They travel the whole year!

961
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:32,658
They scheduled to this week
because they had no other time.

962
01:12:32,798 --> 01:12:36,427
Japan, Scotland...

963
01:12:36,902 --> 01:12:39,029
At Milu Vilela's house
there's a wall painted by them.

964
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:40,435
Yeah.

965
01:12:40,706 --> 01:12:41,934
We did it, right?

966
01:12:42,007 --> 01:12:45,568
I think those works with
colorful letters are also graffiti.

967
01:12:45,711 --> 01:12:49,841
It can't be erased, so, I think we
need to... because our work,

968
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:54,219
like this one, it is respected
now, but what about the others

969
01:12:54,219 --> 01:12:57,916
that are... Thousands of
other artists in town, right?

970
01:12:58,857 --> 01:13:01,189
I didn't know!
That I didn't know!

971
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:07,192
You didn't know, right?
Matarazzo! We are leaving.

972
01:13:17,176 --> 01:13:21,246
I wore the best clothes
and sent the kids

973
01:13:21,246 --> 01:13:25,740
Everyone showered up and
combed, just to please

974
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,914
Mr. Mayor, the authority
and the priest to bless

975
01:13:30,122 --> 01:13:35,958
Today we'll eat grey paint
brought by the VW, van

976
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:41,194
Just take this Picture,
Instagram it to denounce

977
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:45,804
I'll put a tag in your forehead,
and a hashtag along with it

978
01:13:45,804 --> 01:13:50,104
A bomb and a throw up from
the other side of the bridge

979
01:13:50,275 --> 01:13:55,838
Fight against this grey paint
brought by the VW, van

980
01:14:10,262 --> 01:14:14,700
Neither minister, nor president
with the scene will agree

981
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,932
Enough to be embarrassed
for the others

982
01:14:19,004 --> 01:14:23,242
I wore the best clothes
and sent the kids

983
01:14:23,242 --> 01:14:28,680
Don'tlet me eat grey paint
brought by the VW, van

984
01:14:38,824 --> 01:14:41,691
AFTER 150 HOURS OF SPRAY, THE
COLORS ARE BACK ON THE WALL.

985
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,594
When one of the twins questioned
about the whole

986
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:49,861
He got bounced, but the
can will retaliate

987
01:14:50,002 --> 01:14:53,563
Today we won't eat grey paint
brought by the VW, van

988
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:56,073
DESPITE THE REPERCUSSION KASSAB'S
MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

989
01:14:56,241 --> 01:14:58,641
PAINTING GRAY GRAFFITIS THROUGH
OUT THE CITY.

990
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:00,870
UNTIL THE RELEASE OF THIS
FILM, THE NEW MAYOR,

991
01:15:01,013 --> 01:15:02,981
FERNANDO HADDAD, KEPT
THE SAME POLICY.

992
01:15:03,682 --> 01:15:06,207
GILBERTO KASSAB - LEFT THE
CITY HALL WITH LOW APPROVAL RATES.

993
01:15:06,285 --> 01:15:08,253
FOUNDED ANEW PARTY THAT HAS
BECOME ONE OF THE MAIN

994
01:15:08,654 --> 01:15:11,987
POLITICAL FORCES IN BRAZIL.

995
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:15,994
NINA - CAME TO BE REPRESENTED
BY AN IMPORTANT ART GALLERY

996
01:15:15,994 --> 01:15:18,189
AND PUBLISHED A BOOK WITH
AN OVERVIEW OF HER WORK.
