1
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,381
It's over.

2
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,371
I will always speak to you...

3
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,866
...and I don't mind if
you don't say anything.

4
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,630
Just because you went away, it doesn't
mean you're not here anymore.

5
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,686
Perhaps all I ever needed
was this gift.

6
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,550
The one you gave to me at the end.

7
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,340
WOMB

8
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,036
- Shall I read to you?
- No, thanks.

9
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,676
Good night, Grandpa.

10
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,661
Hi! I'm Tommy.
And you?

11
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,837
Rebecca.

12
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,827
Have you moved here?

13
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,956
No, my grandpa lives here,
I'm staying with him.

14
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,060
Rebecca, your grandfather's on the phone.

15
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,840
She's fallen asleep.
Shall I wake her up?

16
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,335
No. Not at all.
That's fine.

17
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,403
She's welcome to stay tonight.

18
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,438
Good night!

19
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,501
Tell me where we're going.

20
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,301
Up till now, he's only seen
blades of grass before.

21
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,231
It must seem like a
different planet to him.

22
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,996
Tomorrow we'll take him on the beach
and show him the sea.

23
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,076
I won't be here tomorrow.
I'm going away.

24
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,181
Are you going home?

25
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,861
- No.
- Where then?

26
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,591
- To Tokyo.
- Japan?

27
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,193
- What for?.

28
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,898
Mom's got a job there.

29
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,790
- We'll be living on the 72nd floor.
- 72nd?

30
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,666
That's high.

31
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,901
I have to go.

32
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,589
- Hi?
- Rebecca?

33
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:35,685
Where are you?

34
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,632
On the beach, I came out to look to the storm.

35
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,509
- When are you going tomorrow?
- I'm leaving at six, on the ferry.

36
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,360
I'll see you off, I've got a good idea.

37
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,346
- Rebecca?
- Yes, I'm here.

38
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,270
Tommy, hello?
Tommy?

39
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,716
It's time, Rebecca.

40
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,590
- Excuse me.
- What can I do for you?

41
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,181
- I've come to see Tommy.
- Oh, he hasn't lived here for a long time.

42
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,901
You look very familiar.
Have I metyou somewhere before?

43
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,587
I'm Rebecca.

44
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,520
Rebecca... The little girI,
thatwent to Japan?

45
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,814
For a while, Tommy nagged us
about going to Tokyo.

46
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,866
But then he forgot about it, luckily.

47
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,971
Where does he live now?

48
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,240
Do you know the little harbor
down by the embankment?

49
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,067
You'll find him there.

50
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,891
Hello?

51
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,960
Who are you?
What are you doing?

52
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,046
- I'm looking for Thomas.
- I'm Thomas.

53
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,227
Who are you?

54
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,661
Hi, Tom.

55
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,131
Hi.

56
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,827
Who is she?

57
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,707
How was Japan?

58
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,716
- Fine.
- 72 th floor.

59
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,887
So, let's try like normaI people.
I'm Rose, this is Tommy. And your name?

60
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,981
- Are you going back?
- No, I finished my degree.

61
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,846
- What did you study?
- Maths.

62
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,006
And now?
What do you do now?

63
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,500
I design software for sonar devices.

64
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,560
Sonar devices that detects tiny cracks
in underground storage tanks.

65
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,214
Like the kind used in petroI stations,
you know they sometimes crack.

66
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,146
CooI.

67
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,741
So Bingo letyou come in just like that?

68
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,570
I've never seen him do that,
he hates strangers usually.

69
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,368
Once he bit a girI's thigh,
though she menstruated.

70
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,410
- Maybe he liked your scent.
- Maybe.

71
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,550
Maybe you twojust start
sniffing each other?.

72
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,020
How many years is it?

73
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,015
- Twelve.
- Twelve.

74
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,351
Maybe I should go.

75
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,301
Does Rose know thatyou're here?

76
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,581
I don't know.

77
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,624
She is your girlfriend, isn't she?

78
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,701
Girlfriend?

79
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,440
I met her yesterday for
the first time in my life.

80
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,071
How long is it since your
grandfather passed away?

81
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,501
Long time ago.

82
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,151
It's odd.

83
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,719
Seemed bigger in my mind.

84
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,533
Do you remember that night, when
you had an idea...

85
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,510
...and you didn't turn up?

86
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,106
Whatwas your idea, do you remember?.

87
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,861
I thoughtyou'd never ask.

88
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,446
I wanted to give him to you that morning.

89
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,310
Tokyo would have been
a great adventure for him.

90
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,973
I fed him, for about a year actually,
after you left.

91
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,940
He managed to eat and shit
at the same time.

92
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,620
Which is impressive.

93
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,307
He looked too good.

94
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,151
And one day, he didn't
appear anymore.

95
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,460
He was dead.

96
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,262
Why didn'tyou come?

97
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,491
I overslept.

98
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,067
But now I'm awake.

99
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,467
You're cold.

100
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,426
Weird.

101
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,037
I know.

102
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,016
Yeah.

103
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,646
- What are you doing this weekend?
- Same as you.

104
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,491
I can't do it.

105
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,547
- I have to go away.
- I'll come with you.

106
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,756
I have to go alone.
It'll only be two days.

107
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,131
Where were yo go, I go.

108
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,986
This is somewhere you can't go.

109
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,036
Then you shouldn't go either.

110
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,765
They simply drained the marsh...

111
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,861
...and caught it thousands of tons of
reinforced concrete over there.

112
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:00,765
They built in six months, which is a record.

113
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,362
On paper, it's a wellness center.
They've called it Sparkling Park.

114
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,316
Profitwill mainly come from
cyber-prostitution, you know...

115
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,973
...cyber-bitches, the plastic surgery,
cloning of domestic animals.

116
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,203
They opened lastweek.

117
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,324
This will be their firstweekend,
or rather our weekend...

118
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:22,310
...because our group will
be there too.

119
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,293
Group?

120
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,798
Pollungroup. A militant environmentaI
activist group.

121
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,104
Itwill be a planned action,
with 23 participants.

122
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,645
We go inside, we cause
mass hysteria Rebecca...

123
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,437
...I'm telling you, mass hysteria,
thus diverting the security guards.

124
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:44,194
Now, meanwhile outside, the other guys
were blocked the enterance and...

125
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:47,243
...exit to the carpark with a quick
setting cement pooI.

126
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,257
You know quick-cement?
No? Fine, don'tworry about it.

127
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,303
- Anyway, then the media will turn up...
- How do you do that, mass hysteria?

128
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,301
Ready?

129
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,660
You see those rucksacks? We're going to release
the cockroaches from those in the shops.

130
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,381
Around the pools and the restaurants, just
depending on the where the largest crowd are, really.

131
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,981
"Sparkling Park"

132
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,380
I've got six ruckssacks.

133
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,286
- Where are you going? - Away.
- What's all of this you're carrying?

134
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,606
Backpacks.

135
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,581
- Do you want to come in for a coffee?
- No, no, not now.

136
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,729
Well, do I even get a kiss?

137
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,799
- What?
- I love your plan. Did you think it up all by yourself?

138
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,950
A- ha, yeah, of course.

139
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,097
What?

140
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,700
I am but a simple cockroach breeder Rebecca.

141
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,706
I hope that makes me good enough for you.

142
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,726
I've always dreamt of meeting
a cockroach breeder.

143
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,091
I need to pee.

144
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,031
- How badly?
- Badly.

145
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,513
"I will wait for you,
for as long as it takes. "

146
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,176
- I can not eat Rebecca, I'm sorry.
- - At least sit down.

147
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,589
At least sit down.

148
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,307
I can't sit, either.

149
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,266
Would you tell us please
why you invited us here?

150
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,131
Of course.

151
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,262
He could be here with us again.

152
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,907
Again? Who, Thomas?

153
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,747
Who would give birth to him?

154
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,332
Ralph.

155
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,170
We are atheists...

156
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,054
...and we brought up Thomas
as an atheist.

157
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,106
But that does not mean we could rummage
in our deceased's grave and clone them.

158
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,706
We are not farm animals.

159
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,586
We acceptwhat life gives us...

160
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,214
...and also what it takes away.

161
00:38:24,249 --> 00:38:25,593
But...

162
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,255
Butwhat?

163
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,671
But life has also given us
this opportunity.

164
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,980
This gift.

165
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,706
Don'tyou see?

166
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,743
If I were you Rebecca,
I would repaint this room white.

167
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,069
Ralph?

168
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,267
Thank you.

169
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,267
Would you like us to move away?

170
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,390
No, stay.

171
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,053
He loved the sea,
he'll love it again.

172
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,850
As for us, there is no way we can stay here.

173
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,958
We're moving next week.

174
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,446
Okay.

175
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,331
Thank you, Ralph.

176
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,439
Rebecca...

177
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,403
...have a good think about it.

178
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,111
You can still change your mind.

179
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,971
Thank you.

180
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,612
- Hi.
- Hello.

181
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,871
- How old is your baby?
- Three months.

182
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,541
Do you want some pie?
Baked it myself.

183
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:26,781
Thanks, but not now.
I have to go to home.

184
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,476
- Okay.
- Bye. - Bye.

185
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,266
It's alright, baby.

186
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,307
Eat, sweetheart.

187
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,467
It'sjust us two.

188
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,251
Tommy?

189
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,434
Come out for a bit, I want to tell you something.

190
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,766
- What?
- Come out darling.

191
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:47,070
I know. I know I'll be going to
primary schooI and I go on Monday.

192
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:52,650
Yes, on Monday, you'll go to
primary schooI. But now come out.

193
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,946
I can see you okay from in here.

194
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,071
I have to speak to you
aboutyour daddy.

195
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,000
Your daddy died in a car
accident before you were born.

196
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,491
- Really?
- Yes.

197
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,245
- I thought he went back to his home planet.
- His home planet?

198
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,246
- Yes.
- Your father was from this planet.

199
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,610
That's a shame.

200
00:46:36,645 --> 00:46:38,260
Listen Thomas.

201
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:44,460
Your father was reaI,
he was a student in biology.

202
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,627
And he was hit by a car.

203
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,461
Do you understand?

204
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,086
A man of words and not of deeds
is like a garden full of weeds.

205
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:44,852
And when the weeds begin to grow,
It's like a garden full of snow.

206
00:47:44,887 --> 00:47:49,663
And when the snow begins to fall,
it's like a bird upon the wall.

207
00:47:49,698 --> 00:47:54,489
And when the bird away does fly,
it's like an eagle in the sky.

208
00:47:54,524 --> 00:47:59,125
And when the sky begins to roar,
it's like a lion at the door.

209
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:04,131
And when the door begins to crack,
it's like a stick across your back.

210
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:08,965
And when your back begins to smart,
it's like a penknife in your heart.

211
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:16,247
And when your heart begins to bleed,
you're dead, and dead, and dead indeed...

212
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,220
I keep dying.

213
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,861
Try again.

214
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,267
Mom?

215
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,791
Eric's staying over tonight.

216
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,651
Hi.

217
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,900
Can I getyou anything?

218
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,106
Hi, Mom.
Look at that little rabbit.

219
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,351
It's lovely.
What's your name?

220
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,891
I Dima, and that breast.

221
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,440
- - Snow Lump orjust Lump?
- - Just Lump.

222
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,960
Well, we're off.
Bye, Tommy, see you.

223
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,060
Wouldn'tyou like to come and
play at our house Dima?

224
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,147
No, thank you.

225
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,042
- I can smell it. What aboutyou?
- I could.

226
00:51:03,077 --> 00:51:03,925
What did you smell?

227
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,576
- The copy smell.
- What?

228
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,811
Copy smell. Copies have a
weird smell.

229
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,792
- Where did you hear that?
- Oh mom, everyone knows that.

230
00:51:14,827 --> 00:51:19,065
They smell like window cleaner.
It comes from their skin.

231
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,131
So?

232
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,270
Eric says thatyou invited
little Dima into your home.

233
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,932
Yes.
Why?

234
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:00,841
Look Rebecca, we don't have any
problem with human repliaction...

235
00:52:00,876 --> 00:52:04,042
...we think that some clones
are decent people

236
00:52:04,077 --> 00:52:06,394
they have their own lives and rights...

237
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,781
The thing is, it's too complicated
for our kids.

238
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,941
Now we hear about these things in the news
all the time, but quite frankly...

239
00:52:16,976 --> 00:52:20,924
we do notwant our children coming up
against these things first hand.

240
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:24,340
Neither do you, I suppose.

241
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,342
Dima is the victim of
artificiaI incest.

242
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,726
Her mother gave birth to her own mother.

243
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,306
Did you know that?

244
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,835
So, if you'd known, you obviously wouldn't
have invited her into your home, would you?

245
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,866
No, of course not.

246
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,341
I'm gonna go now.

247
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,666
Come on Eric.

248
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,486
Come and give me a hand Tommy.

249
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,181
It's your party after all.

250
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,427
Hi.

251
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,094
Molly, it's Rebecca. I justwanted to
make sure you got the invitation?

252
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:14,301
But he...

253
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,341
I see.

254
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,485
Happy birthday, Tommy.

255
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,544
- But the others aren't...
- There'll just be the two of us, my love.

256
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,341
Two?
Butwhy?

257
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,051
- The others aren't coming.
- Why aren't they coming?

258
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,947
Because of the copy?

259
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,404
Butwe didn't invite the copy,
we didn't invite her on purpose.

260
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,133
Why aren't they coming mom?
Please?

261
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,916
- Mom!
- Because the mothers...

262
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:47,267
Their mothers were not allowed.

263
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:49,883
Why not?

264
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:53,920
- Because they are stupid.
- Stupid?

265
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,146
Where we going, Mom?

266
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,654
This is exactly how I imagined it.

267
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,466
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

268
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,716
CooI, it's like the end of the world.

269
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,347
Mom?

270
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,311
Come quickly.

271
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,701
I thought they were extinct long ago.

272
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,621
Can I take one home?

273
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:50,275
Home?
That's where we are, Tommy.

274
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,313
Tommy?
I'm back.

275
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,671
You can look.

276
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:15,945
- CooI!
- What are you gonna call him?

277
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,826
I don't know.

278
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,494
Bingo?

279
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:29,396
Bingo?
No.

280
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,318
Booboo.

281
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,765
- Really?
- Yeah.

282
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,791
Thanks, Mom.

283
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,746
Hi, I'm Mark.

284
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,947
We are neighbors.

285
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,795
- Can I see in your binoculars?
- Sure.

286
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:36,341
Come on.

287
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,266
And you there when Father died?

288
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,907
Yes.

289
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,326
- How did it happen?
- What made you think of it now?

290
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,651
I do not know.

291
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:03,346
You know, itwas an accident.

292
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,107
What sort of accident?

293
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:16,998
We were on the road, we stopped,
he got out of the car...

294
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:21,564
- ... and another car hit him.
- What sort of car?.

295
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:27,900
Van, Tommy, coming very fast.

296
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,796
- What sort of van?
- I do not know.

297
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,676
Why did you stop?

298
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:50,840
- Why did you stop?
- I had to pee.

299
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,350
Now I can do whatever I wantwith you.

300
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:57,226
Go ahead.

301
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,252
Tommy?

302
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,907
Tommy?

303
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:11,171
Good night, Mom.

304
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,311
Good night, Tommy!

305
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:46,620
Everything will be alright my love.

306
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,741
Good morning!

307
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,419
Mom...
Good morning!

308
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:53,365
Weird. I was in university...

309
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,925
...I was a rusty tin...

310
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,545
...or not even a tin,
but some kind of container.

311
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:10,387
I moved to creak, as the old job.

312
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:19,354
When I lent down, this rusty sort of
liquid flow through my mouth.

313
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:24,187
Itwas cooI.

314
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,420
Good morning!

315
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,040
Mom, this is Monica.
Monica, mom.

316
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,906
- Hi.
- Hi.

317
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,300
What did you dream about?

318
01:10:51,200 --> 01:10:54,101
Nothing.

319
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,300
Enjoy.

320
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,563
Did we wake you when
we came in last night?

321
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,146
- I wasn't asleep.
- But itwas dawn.

322
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,116
Did you ever sleep, Mom?

323
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,541
Sometimes.

324
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:38,516
Monica went out for couple of things,
she'll be back soon.

325
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:43,486
She'll be living here for a while, I mean
of course only if you don't mind.

326
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,235
Mom?

327
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,926
She is a nice girI.

328
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,065
Pleased to have her here.

329
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:15,406
...after thought?
I love thinking about this.

330
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:20,207
Imagine great snow storms over the oceans,
in the mountains, deep in the clouds...

331
01:12:20,242 --> 01:12:21,925
for millions of years on this planet,

332
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:24,258
...billions of tiny snow crystals have
been whirling about...

333
01:12:24,293 --> 01:12:28,370
...and no two of the are same.
Just like us in fact.

334
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,405
- As people?
- Yeah, as two.

335
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,568
I was thinking of all living things,
notjust our faces and our fingerprints.

336
01:12:34,603 --> 01:12:38,393
villus in our lungs, our irises,
the structure of our brains...

337
01:12:38,428 --> 01:12:40,140
...and nails, you know,
everything about us.

338
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:43,845
I mean, think about, how long are birds here?
They came not long after dinosours.

339
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:47,418
Basicly, way before us. Can you imagine,
how many billions of feathers they produce...

340
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:50,956
From ostrich to terns, to hummingbirds,
from penguins

341
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,887
Everywhere in the world.
It must be an orbitaI thing.

342
01:12:53,922 --> 01:12:56,495
A billion times of billion times of billion,
you know...

343
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,828
There are no two alike.
This is a duck's feather.

344
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:05,194
It's almost incomprehensible, billions
of amazingly complex patterns...

345
01:13:05,229 --> 01:13:07,953
...permanently whirling around us
and never repeat themselves.

346
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,245
What's the matter?.

347
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,795
I don't know Tommy...
This is so...

348
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,205
...so immature.

349
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,267
- Really?
- Yes, really.

350
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,243
So?

351
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,833
- So what?
- Do you like kids?

352
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,114
Come in.

353
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,673
Hi Mom.

354
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:19,822
Smells great, doesn't it?

355
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,470
Monica baked it, I was the kitchen boy.

356
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,173
- He is a very good kitchen boy.
- Thank you very much.

357
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,107
Thanks.

358
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,560
- I'm not hungry now, I'll have it later.
- Okay.

359
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,342
Mom.

360
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:57,066
Good night!

361
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,701
I don't think she's been up for the day.

362
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:11,108
- I think you should talk to her.
- And what shall I say it?

363
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,411
Mom?

364
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:07,386
It's you.

365
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,856
Wait.

366
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:49,981
- Hang on.
- Why?

367
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,421
I have to take a shower.

368
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,711
Let's take one together.

369
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,220
Tommy, don't.

370
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:39,546
No, no!
No.

371
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,965
Stop it.

372
01:20:56,120 --> 01:21:00,068
- Wait.
- What? What's wrong?

373
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,186
I think she woke up.

374
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:13,066
Aren'tyou going to say anything?

375
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,827
Hello.

376
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:05,180
Can I help you?

377
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:28,476
Go inside now Tommy.

378
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:38,380
Who are you?

379
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,166
Who is that, Mom?

380
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:36,051
Mom.

381
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:41,786
Who was thatwoman, Mom?

382
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,666
Tommy?

383
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:04,611
Tommy?

384
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,140
I know her.

385
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,901
Tommy?

386
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,515
Let me in, please.

387
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:47,796
You've been in there for hours.

388
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:53,036
Please, open the door.

389
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:03,101
I'm leaving.

390
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:09,252
Mom?

391
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,867
Mom?

392
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,986
I have to tell you something.

393
01:30:56,040 --> 01:31:01,057
I was nine,
I was on the beach...

394
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:06,226
Itwas so cold.

395
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:11,380
- Then I met this boy?
- What, what, what boy?

396
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:15,656
What beach? Who cares?
Who is this woman, Mother?.

397
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:42,316
No! No!
No!

398
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,091
I'm scared.

399
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:22,425
I do not know who you are.

400
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:29,250
Or who I am either.

401
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:38,316
Who are you, Mom?

402
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:43,507
Who are you?

403
01:35:47,720 --> 01:35:50,746
Why did you do it?

404
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:55,436
Why did you do this thing?

405
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:02,531
- Look atyourself, Tommy, you're here.
- So? So? So?

406
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:06,997
What am I supposed to do now?
What am I supposed to do with this fucking life?

407
01:36:07,032 --> 01:36:09,508
Don'tyou see I have no idea who I am!

408
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:12,752
Can'tyou understand?

409
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:18,455
- What more could you want?
- More than what?

410
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:24,275
You're here, Tommy.

411
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,626
You're alive

412
01:36:29,280 --> 01:36:32,306
Take your hands off me.

413
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:37,330
Take your hands off me.

414
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,341
Who are you?

415
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:02,940
Who are you?

416
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,576
Who are you?

417
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:12,061
Who are you?

418
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,763
Thank you...

419
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:45,319
...Rebecca.
