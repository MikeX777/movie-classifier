1
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,229
Did you hear a scream?

2
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,358
Like a wild bird, maybe an eagle.

3
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,312
Major...

4
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,391
...I hate this jeep.

5
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,633
<i>I bak ed an eagle once.</i>

6
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,070
<i>Made out of bread.</i>

7
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,115
<i>Finocchi's Bak ery in Los Angeles.</i>

8
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,360
<i>This nut from the Wildlife Federation
ordered it.</i>

9
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,313
We came to the wrong war.

10
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,229
<i>If we harness that mother,
he'll pull us to Maldorais.</i>

11
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,236
Easily. Maldorais is just there,
beyond the hill.

12
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,757
<i>I see Sainte-Croix on the map.
I don't see Maldorais.</i>

13
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,071
Because Maldorais is not a village.

14
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,798
It is a castle.

15
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,158
<i>- A castle?
- Oh, we're gonna barrack in a castle.</i>

16
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,671
It is my castle.

17
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,476
<i>We're going to barrack
in your castle.</i>

18
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,999
The Germans did the same.

19
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,194
<i>We're Americans.</i>

20
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,715
<i>I am Henri Tixier,
Comte de Maldorais.</i>

21
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,078
- Captain Beckman.
- Lionel Beckman, the art historian.

22
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,593
Castles interest him.

23
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,232
And this is Major...

24
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,077
<i>Falconer. Let's go.</i>

25
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,869
Keen horse you got there,
Mr. Tixier.

26
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,559
Thank you.

27
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,512
The Germans had no Negro.

28
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,430
These kind gentlemen rescued me
from a slaver off of Santo Domingo.

29
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,318
Went down with all hands.

30
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,233
They thought they could
learn Swahili from me.

31
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,479
Private Benjamin wants to be a writer,
so he talks like a writer.

32
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,474
He thinks the war was invented
so he could write a book about it.

33
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,149
Yes, it is Maldorais.

34
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,357
<i>Hey, how long was
the Hundred Years' War?</i>

35
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,717
Exactly 215 years.

36
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,996
There are rooms off the great hall.

37
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,071
The enlisted men can
live in the keep.

38
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,516
- The keep?
- Castle keep, the tower.

39
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,671
All right, gentlemen.

40
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,432
Has anyone got the exact time?

41
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,469
<i>There you are, Benjamin,
a title for your book: Castle Keep.</i>

42
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,991
Not bad.

43
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,595
Castle Keep.

44
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,878
<i>By PFC Alistair P. Benjamin.</i>

45
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,314
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

46
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,916
<i>...eight walking wounded misfits
of the American Army...</i>

47
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,719
<i>...entered a castle in Belgium.</i>

48
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,954
<i>But this cannot be a Gothic tale,
because it was the Second World War.</i>

49
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,149
<i>Doesn't it give everything
another dimension?</i>

50
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,992
No.

51
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,190
Maybe the duke
could put in an elevator.

52
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,191
Yeah.

53
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,829
And a flush toilet.

54
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,038
Think my living here
will lower the real-estate value?

55
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,190
<i>You trained for the ministry,
didn't you, lieutenant?</i>

56
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,034
<i>Then why aren't you a chaplain?</i>

57
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,795
<i>And then the snow came.</i>

58
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,633
<i>It was a good time to write.</i>

59
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,760
<i>All of us had been killed twice.</i>

60
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,388
<i>Some of us three times.</i>

61
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,949
<i>Maybe that's why
we were at the castle.</i>

62
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,835
<i>We had been sent to the castle
as a replacement company.</i>

63
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,309
<i>Or maybe we had
just been put there...</i>

64
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,630
<i>...away from everything...</i>

65
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,759
<i>...to nurse our wounds
and sit out the war.</i>

66
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,752
<i>That was three weeks ago
when the castle was occupied.</i>

67
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,390
<i>No one knows when the major
occupied the countess.</i>

68
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,393
<i>But no one was surprised.</i>

69
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,428
<i>- Yes, Captain Beckman?
- I'm sorry, sir, I didn't know.</i>

70
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,076
<i>You'll learn, Beckman.</i>

71
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,114
<i>It's 6:00, sir. I'm sorry.</i>

72
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,478
<i>You can't do anything about that,
Beckman.</i>

73
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,315
- The men in the chapel?
- Not yet, sir.

74
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,272
Three minutes.

75
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,599
Bitch.

76
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,752
<i>Sergeant Rossi, he's on the way down.</i>

77
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,870
Do you have a pack
of cigarettes for me?

78
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,670
I have a chocolate bar.

79
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,238
Do you want it?

80
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,279
The major wants everybody
to get his ass in the chapel!

81
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,954
<i>It isn't necessary that we
admire each other.</i>

82
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,275
This is where one U.S. Division
is holding a 23-mile front.

83
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,033
<i>If the Germans decide not to lose
the war so fast, they'll counterattack.</i>

84
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,909
<i>They'll hit that green division
and those people will not stop them.</i>

85
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,832
<i>The Germans' first objective...</i>

86
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,237
...will be to secure the hub of the
road net in the Ardennes.

87
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,789
This town, Bastogne.

88
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,078
The easiest way to Bastogne
is through Verviers.

89
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,151
<i>But they're not coming that way.</i>

90
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,039
Last night there were star shells over
Sainte-Croix. You may have noticed.

91
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,919
They lit the crossroads.
It interests them.

92
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,436
I just want to explain those star shells
to you.

93
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,356
<i>It means this is the way they're
coming. Right here. This castle.</i>

94
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,358
- Any questions?
- I thought the war was over.

95
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,154
<i>- That's not a question.
- Sir...</i>

96
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,711
...I think you ought to let the
Indian express himself.

97
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,190
- Make him feel part of the group.
- Express yourself.

98
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,079
<i>The Germans couldn't move
that many men...</i>

99
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,276
...without our intelligence
knowing it.

100
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,711
<i>- Right. Now you're part of the group.
- I have a question.</i>

101
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,035
<i>If they counterattack, wouldn't we be
more valuable at the Meuse River?</i>

102
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,750
Saving the castle, the paintings,
the sculpture...

103
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,990
...has nothing
to do with your strategy.

104
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,994
Frankly, yes, it does.

105
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,632
<i>Well, that's a business about
which I understand nothing.</i>

106
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,278
We were put here
to service replacements.

107
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,556
But there are no replacements.

108
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,756
<i>So we'll dig in, like real soldiers.</i>

109
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,191
I want the terraces
and gardens mined.

110
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,550
Major Falconer.

111
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,634
Maldorais must not become
a battleground.

112
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,872
Not a battleground, duke,
an island of resistance.

113
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,476
<i>I'll make a diagram of the mining
tonight. Also a patrol roster.</i>

114
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,428
Any weapons left behind by the
Germans I want put in firing condition.

115
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,070
Meantime, keep the men occupied.
Find something. Anything.

116
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,477
Put on a play.

117
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,271
I got a good play.

118
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,079
<i>This army stops at a castle.
They're embattled.</i>

119
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,510
They can surrender
and save the castle...

120
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,910
<i>...or they can hold.
- It won't work, sir.</i>

121
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,559
It should be about screwing.

122
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,872
Screwing was invented by the Swedes
during World War I.

123
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,193
- I got a play.
- Tell it.

124
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,278
A small man comes on stage
with a great erection.

125
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,317
Then what?

126
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,636
<i>That's all I got.
Just the first act.</i>

127
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,878
<i>That won't carry the play by itself.</i>

128
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,117
Well, suppose it goes down
and down in each succeeding act.

129
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,152
- To infinity.
- Nope.

130
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,154
Any actor who could play the part
would get better offers.

131
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,590
Track of the animal.

132
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,193
A boar?

133
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,476
No, a German.

134
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,114
Why not an American?

135
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,279
<i>Those are hobnailed boots.
We don't wear them.</i>

136
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,872
<i>- Should we not return for help?
- No, it's a patrol.</i>

137
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,750
They probably broke
through our lines.

138
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,630
<i>- Is there a place we can fort up?
- The summerhouse.</i>

139
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,951
<i>- Does it have a clear field of fire?
- Yes.</i>

140
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,998
<i>Then we'll decoy them
to the summerhouse.</i>

141
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,118
What have you got there?

142
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,271
- Han vase.
- What?

143
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,919
Second dynasty.

144
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,638
<i>They're high, about 2 o'clock.</i>

145
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,631
<i>- How's the vase?
- Intact, commandant.</i>

146
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,714
<i>They'll rush us when they
get into position.</i>

147
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,871
<i>That's harassing fire
to keep us down.</i>

148
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,869
<i>- I've been in a war, commandant.
- Then get rid of that junk.</i>

149
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,391
<i>It's cocked and ready to fire.</i>

150
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,993
<i>Wait till you've got a clear target.
I've got them all spotted.</i>

151
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,552
They had no leader.

152
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,351
One man is missing.

153
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,080
<i>I don't think so.
There were only four tracks.</i>

154
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,755
<i>They wouldn't send a patrol
this deep without an officer.</i>

155
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,672
Their officer left them earlier.

156
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,111
Perhaps he went to the castle.

157
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,717
- To what purpose?
- Maybe a mission of his own.

158
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,919
What is it, Captain Beckman?

159
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,154
<i>Jealousy, I'm afraid.</i>

160
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,470
In a chapel?

161
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,070
<i>I've always wanted to live with...</i>

162
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,515
In a place like this.

163
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,478
<i>Now that I'm here, I feel as if...</i>

164
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,109
No, I am an intruder.

165
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,554
We are...

166
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,952
...unwelcome.

167
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,314
Captain Beckman, you are the one
who belongs at Maldorais.

168
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,353
<i>I've got the German spotted.</i>

169
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,830
<i>- Where?
- Under the topiary tree near the moat.</i>

170
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,797
<i>Just left your
wing of the castle.</i>

171
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,871
<i>He's waiting to see
if it's all clear.</i>

172
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,396
<i>He has a rifle, but he doesn't know
where the shooting came from.</i>

173
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,915
<i>I'd estimate his range at 200 yards.</i>

174
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,878
<i>- My wing of the castle?
- Yes.</i>

175
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,556
<i>- Is everything correct?
- Everything is correct, duk e.</i>

176
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,398
<i>You shot well, commandant.</i>

177
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,511
He has been a visitor,
when the Germans occupied the castle.

178
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,313
He treated the castle with respect.

179
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,792
Your niece seems upset.

180
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,991
<i>My niece is my wife, commandant.</i>

181
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,034
<i>I think you'd better see
to your wife, duke.</i>

182
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,398
<i>God is neutral, along with the pope.</i>

183
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,635
<i>But as a traditionalist,
he must respect the hierarchy.</i>

184
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,392
<i>The Maldorais.</i>

185
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,438
<i>The Maldorais line must continue.</i>

186
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,831
<i>And God must know
where the Americans fit.</i>

187
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,915
<i>Americans are brave and that is why
they seem lik e children.</i>

188
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,957
<i>They are young, wild animals.</i>

189
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,070
<i>So, what can you expect?</i>

190
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,232
<i>I can expect a child.</i>

191
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,676
After the war,
the flowers will be dead.

192
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,197
And the husbands will take over.

193
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,758
Excuse me, sir.

194
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,480
<i>I'd like your permission
to hang this Delacroix...</i>

195
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,757
...and some other paintings
in the parlour for my lecture.

196
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,319
Your lecture?

197
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,711
<i>I'm organizing an entertainment
program for the men.</i>

198
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,639
If it is a matter
of their requirements...

199
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,119
Requirements?

200
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,671
That can be taken care of in the village
at La Reine Rouge.

201
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,958
- The Red Queen?
- The whorehouse.

202
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,036
- A cigar, captain?
- No.

203
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,079
<i>- Hobbema.
- Yes, a very early one, isn't it?</i>

204
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,755
You live with such things, count.

205
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,356
<i>Works I've read about, second-hand
descriptions that don't do them justice.</i>

206
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,909
<i>I've begun an inventory. Unbelievable.</i>

207
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,071
A Botticelli, two Corots.

208
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,874
- Fragonard...
- We are in danger.

209
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,391
Do you intend to do anything
about it, captain?

210
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,110
<i>Wait! That's the count's car!</i>

211
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,232
<i>- Enlisted men can't steal his car.
- Right.</i>

212
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,960
- Where you going at this hour?
- Drilling, sir.

213
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,999
- Drilling?
- Drilling the girls at the Red Queen.

214
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,308
<i>So now we were
on the way to Sainte- Croix.</i>

215
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,115
<i>The cowboy,
the 24-karat Indian, the cook...</i>

216
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,550
<i>... the bak er and myself.</i>

217
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,917
<i>The rage of Paris, France,
and all women everywhere.</i>

218
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,436
<i>Bring out early in your book
that you're very young and Negro...</i>

219
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,318
...unscrewed and unpublished.

220
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,359
I hate this car.

221
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,712
<i>Who's home to welcome the heroes?</i>

222
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,274
Hey, Rossi.

223
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,639
<i>Where there's a bakery,
there's a baker's wife.</i>

224
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,160
The place is closed.

225
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,519
- Where do you come from?
- We come from the castle.

226
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,394
To where are you going?

227
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,792
<i>To the ends of the Earth.
And I think we're there.</i>

228
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,434
<i>Parlez English?</i>

229
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,591
Enough.

230
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,635
<i>I'm a baker.</i>

231
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,754
<i>I'm a baker's wife.</i>

232
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,391
Beautiful.

233
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,596
Beautiful.

234
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,231
<i>Where's the baker?</i>

235
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,512
Gone.

236
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,359
<i>That's what a man needs.</i>

237
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:42,434
<i>A baker's wife, kid, family, home.</i>

238
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,510
Come to bed.

239
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,953
<i>I've been making an inventory too,
Captain Beckman.</i>

240
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,350
You should be interested
in that inventory.

241
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,750
<i>If those Americans
don't hold that ridge...</i>

242
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,595
<i>...your inventory will be shot to hell.
- We don't have to defend here.</i>

243
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,910
- We can drop back to...
- I do, Beckman.

244
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,796
<i>Major, I don't think you know
what this castle means.</i>

245
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,878
It stands on the most important
crossroads in the Ardennes.

246
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,190
<i>- Isn't that...?
- On the road to Bastogne.</i>

247
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,478
<i>- I think we should pull back.
- Don't think, Beckman.</i>

248
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,076
<i>If something isn't saved,
then what's it all for?</i>

249
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,959
<i>You can't save anything
by giving it to the Germans.</i>

250
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,078
If you give them anything,
you have to give everything.

251
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,276
Is that what you wanna do,
Beckman?

252
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,115
You know all about this...

253
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,551
...castle.

254
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,070
<i>But you don't know how to hold it.</i>

255
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,315
You want it in ruins. Everything.

256
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,719
Do I, Beckman?

257
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,397
My purpose is madness.

258
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,836
<i>It's the only way you can tell
what really happened in war.</i>

259
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,750
By lying, you can open the door
a little crack on the truth.

260
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,911
Right, baby.

261
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,197
I love the Red Queen.
Red Queen is lovely.

262
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,510
Everybody loves the Red Queen.

263
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,795
<i>Hey, where's Elk?</i>

264
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,119
<i>You're standing on him.</i>

265
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,508
This whole thing has an ineffable,
dreamlike quality.

266
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,319
<i>Like I've been here before.</i>

267
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,631
This place, this queen, girls...

268
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,674
- Major Falconer is a warmonger.
- Yeah.

269
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,513
<i>- Besides that, he's immoral.
- What?</i>

270
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,230
<i>Three of them. It just ain't right.
Three of them.</i>

271
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,198
- Who?
- Major Falconer and the duchess.

272
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,916
<i>- Well, that's only two.
- No, the duke is there.</i>

273
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,799
<i>Probably tucks them in.
It just ain't right.</i>

274
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,918
<i>I see. Two people is okay,
three people, then it's dirty?</i>

275
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,157
<i>For chrissake, Alistair,
can't you see it ain't natural?</i>

276
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,632
<i>Besides that, she's his nephew...
Niece. Anyhow, it just ain't right.</i>

277
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:22,358
A cowboy like you. American cowboy.

278
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,839
<i>So that's what goes on in that big,
wide, wide, outdoor brain.</i>

279
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,713
The movies never told us
this about cowboys.

280
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,429
<i>- You wanna fight?
- Not now, I'm thinking.</i>

281
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,598
<i>- I could whip your ass.
- Yeah, that doesn't concern me.</i>

282
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,354
<i>Right now I'm working on your
moral indignation.</i>

283
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,633
- What the hell is that?
- Your evangelists.

284
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,913
- My evangelists?
- The evangelists of the American Army.

285
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,791
<i>Hey, you're waking everybody up!
Go back to your outfit!</i>

286
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,795
<i>- Excuse me?
- You're waking everybody up.</i>

287
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,315
Go back to your outfit.

288
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,635
<i>We have no outfit.
We've withdrawn.</i>

289
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,915
<i>- We don't believe in fighting.
- Well, who believes in fighting?</i>

290
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,714
We believe in God.

291
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,749
<i>That frightens you, doesn't it?</i>

292
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,679
All you believe in
is fornication and killing.

293
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,315
<i>- What?
- We're conscientious objectors.</i>

294
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,758
You mean you conscientiously
object to fornicating?

295
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,868
<i>Hey, didn't you tell them?</i>

296
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,640
<i>They're supposed
to excuse you from combat.</i>

297
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,274
They said that our sect
was too small!

298
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,598
- Your what was too small?
- Sect! S-E-C-T!

299
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,392
Let the people of the city sleep.

300
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,319
<i>The hell's the matter with you,
lieutenant?</i>

301
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,234
Can I tell you something?

302
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,550
<i>I wish I had the courage
to go to the Red Queen's.</i>

303
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,758
It would be a way of breaking away
from my father.

304
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,197
How does one get the courage,
Captain Beckman?

305
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,436
You have to be an enlisted man.

306
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,519
Cinderella left the ball in such
a hurry, she forgot her glass eye...

307
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,593
<i>Slipper. Now, that's how the prince
traced her. She had the smallest eye...</i>

308
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,591
- Foot in the world.
- Wait a minute.

309
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,797
<i>You say at midnight,
if we don't get back to the castle...</i>

310
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,873
<i>...we're gonna turn into soldiers?
- No, we'll turn into soldiers anyway.</i>

311
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,235
<i>It'd be nice to be in the castle
when it happens.</i>

312
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,472
- Where do you come from?
- My bakery.

313
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,679
- To where are you going?
- To that table where my buddies are.

314
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,192
Everybody should eat more bread.
It feeds the heart.

315
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,033
<i>And remember, the heart's the second
most important organ in the body.</i>

316
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,589
<i>It disturbs you,
my wife and the major.</i>

317
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,312
You find me degenerate.

318
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,711
Or worse, French.

319
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,714
No, I am only impotent.

320
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,950
And I want a son.

321
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,157
What could be more bourgeois,
Puritan, even American, than that?

322
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,034
<i>- You're how old? Twenty, 21?
- Twenty-three.</i>

323
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,313
There ought to be an age limit
on the killing.

324
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,879
<i>That doesn't interfere with you,
does it?</i>

325
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,194
The German officer under
the topiary tree threw his life away.

326
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,120
He made it difficult not to kill him.

327
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,516
He was billeted here?

328
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,958
Yes.

329
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,551
In this room?

330
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,117
Well, how do you feel?

331
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,716
<i>I don't understand.</i>

332
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,437
<i>You don't show much, do you?</i>

333
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,472
What do you want me to do?

334
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,999
<i>I guess there isn't much you can do.</i>

335
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,078
<i>You're not 20 or 23.</i>

336
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,674
<i>You're 1000 years old and you're
trying to keep a castle, aren't you?</i>

337
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,394
The war came close today.

338
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,194
I would like to end it.
For a little while, if I can.

339
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,270
<i>You want to end it, don't you?</i>

340
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,996
For a little while.

341
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,952
For a night.

342
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,079
<i>Just before the end of the world,
Captain Beckman gave us soldiers...</i>

343
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,118
<i>... a lecture on the history of art.</i>

344
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,350
<i>Here was a captain
in the American Army...</i>

345
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,715
<i>... talking about strength and the force...</i>

346
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,356
Private Benjamin, if you feel
more qualified to give this lecture.

347
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,876
<i>Thank you, sir. No, sir.
I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir.</i>

348
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,315
Thank you, Private Benjamin.

349
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,956
We have the privilege of living
in this monumental tribute...

350
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,156
<i>...to man's concept of beauty.</i>

351
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,758
<i>I want you to note the connubial chase
in Rubens' finest, most supple style.</i>

352
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,990
<i>That must've been his horny period.</i>

353
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,190
Sergeant Rossi.

354
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,668
Gentlemen, I suspect
10 years from now, or 20...

355
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:38,071
...at some American Legion
convention...

356
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,197
...one of your nightmares will be
that day in the Ardennes...

357
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,510
<i>...when you weren't blown up
by a bomb...</i>

358
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,717
...you were bored to death by
Captain Beckman.

359
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,553
Now, the purpose of my talk...

360
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,836
...is to shock you.
- Sir?

361
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,197
<i>Isn't the purpose to be sure the troops
don't get an hour off?</i>

362
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,597
The function of all art
is to disturb and awake.

363
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,594
- Now, if I may make a small analogy...
- You do that, sir.

364
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,551
Corporal Clearboy. Was your estimate
General Patton planned in advance...

365
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,757
<i>...his breakthrough out of Normandy?
- I don't know, sir.</i>

366
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,997
I wanted to hear you say that.
He was with General Patton.

367
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,912
He and I were never close, sir.

368
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,639
It makes my point.

369
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,110
<i>There's the same kind of spontaneity
in war as in art.</i>

370
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,556
War is an art of becoming,
a culmination.

371
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,671
An orgasm?

372
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,398
Yes, art is like a sexual experience.

373
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,030
And the sexual experience, like art,
cannot be culminated alone.

374
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,912
You certain about that, sir?

375
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,113
You gentlemen recall the training film
Lieutenant Amberjack showed you?

376
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:50,595
<i>- The one on sex, sir?
- I'd like to link that to the art of war...</i>

377
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,398
<i>...which the film didn't cover.</i>

378
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,552
<i>When you have a sex film,
you can't cover everything.</i>

379
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,593
No, but I mean seriously, gentlemen,
sex without love...

380
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,036
...like art without feeling,
is nothing more than masturbation.

381
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,879
<i>- Shall we write that down?
- I'm just throwing things out.</i>

382
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,719
Could we pursue
that sexual thought further?

383
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,992
- No. No, no, no, no. My point is that...
- Sex is an art.

384
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,912
- No, no.
- Masturbation...

385
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,599
- No, no, De Vaca.
- Sir...

386
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,759
...what would you say if your best girl
were sleeping with a 4F?

387
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,430
<i>I don't have to answer that.</i>

388
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,919
I want to get back to the war.

389
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,712
<i>But I'll leave you with a thought
that might do some good.</i>

390
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,510
<i>I'll say to you bums that if you ever
lecture an hour to a bunch of idiots...</i>

391
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,069
...then resign your commission.

392
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,354
<i>- I'd like to be alone, Alistair.
- You're a fun guy.</i>

393
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,195
<i>- Your talk on art turned me on.
- I don't particularly wanna be fun.</i>

394
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,432
- You mind if I sit down, sir?
- No, you can stand.

395
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,315
You took your lecture too hard.

396
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,391
Is war a subjective thing, sir?

397
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,471
<i>That's a good point.</i>

398
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,518
You know...

399
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,354
- You comfortable?
- Do you mean that facetiously?

400
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,638
No, I mean, you being a private
and me being a captain and everything.

401
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,392
- And everything?
- Yes.

402
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,916
<i>The enemy and the American Army
is out there and we're talking...</i>

403
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,550
Never underestimate the intelligence
of the American soldier, sir.

404
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,198
<i>- You get that in a training manual?
- You shouldn't be bitter, sir.</i>

405
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,796
<i>If a soldier didn't value art,
he wouldn't be much of a soldier.</i>

406
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,748
<i>Napoleon before Venice said, " If my
cannon destroy but one statue...</i>

407
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,751
<i>...I would rather not take Venice."</i>

408
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,950
Did Napoleon say that?

409
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,034
<i>- Doesn't sound like Napoleon.
- Oh, well, no.</i>

410
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,557
- But I thought it would cheer you up.
- I appreciate that.

411
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,913
But Napoleon was a louse.

412
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,910
<i>- I think soldiering is a bore, don't you?
- Yes, sir.</i>

413
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,836
But I see you have the Purple Heart
and Silver Star.

414
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:17,517
<i>I got excited. For a whole year I was
out of my mind, but I've recovered now.</i>

415
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,989
<i>But you'd fight for this castle.</i>

416
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,718
Yes.

417
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,792
<i>I don't know who.</i>

418
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,679
<i>I don't know which side
would want to destroy it.</i>

419
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,589
One thing more, sir.

420
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,035
<i>Sorry I couldn't help
during the lecture.</i>

421
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,316
<i>That's beyond and above
the call of duty.</i>

422
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,074
- Still...
- When you write your book...

423
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,878
...you can rescue me.

424
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,395
<i>No, don't bother.</i>

425
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,477
Just write well about this castle
and how we kept it.

426
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,199
<i>It's really not a bad title,
Castle Keep.</i>

427
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,032
Thank you, sir.

428
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,799
<i>Castle Keep.</i>

429
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,154
We will try, sir.

430
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,270
Will that be all, captain?

431
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,876
That is all.

432
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,398
<i>No one knew exactly when...</i>

433
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,996
<i>... Corporal Clearboy fell in love
with the Volkswagen.</i>

434
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,991
<i>But there he was one morning...</i>

435
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,278
<i>... petting it, shining it up
lik e a silver whore.</i>

436
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,318
<i>I understand you've been sleeping
with the Volkswagen.</i>

437
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,597
Yes, sir. Is there a regulation
against it, sir?

438
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,398
Yes.

439
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,716
<i>- Sodomy?
- That's animals.</i>

440
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,710
<i>There's a regulation against using
enemy equipment. Creates confusion.</i>

441
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,196
<i>Sir. She's a beautiful car, sir.</i>

442
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,160
You must love the Volkswagen
very much, Clearboy.

443
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,989
Thirty-six horses.

444
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,229
No water, sir. Hides her engine
in her rear, air-cooled. No water, sir.

445
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,230
Is the world suffering
a water shortage?

446
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,870
Not now, sir, but suppose this war
just goes on and on and on...

447
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,951
...destroys everything in the world.

448
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,588
Since the Volkswagen
gets along without water...

449
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,149
<i>...she'll survive
when other creatures die off.</i>

450
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,199
Someday the world will be populated
with nothing but Volkswagens.

451
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,432
<i>You've figured that out, Clearboy?</i>

452
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,473
Very well, Corporal Clearboy,
keep it.

453
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,670
Clearboy has a thing
about the Volkswagen.

454
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,559
<i>- Why doesn't he see a doctor?
- Think that's abnormal?</i>

455
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,472
<i>I think it's frustrating as hell.</i>

456
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,672
- Amberjack. I want patrols stepped up.
- Yes, sir.

457
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,958
Be on the lookout for infiltrators
slipping into town in advance of attack.

458
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,111
The place for infiltrators
is the Red...

459
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,111
<i>Exactly. That's where I'd go.</i>

460
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,073
<i>Sir, you want me to go
to the Red Queen's?</i>

461
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,989
No, come back here and play the flute
while Beckman saves statues.

462
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,077
<i>That's the way to fight a war.</i>

463
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,075
Seen any infiltrators lately,
honey, baby, pussy-lamb?

464
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,110
<i>I gotta draw a lieutenant
to lead a patrol who's a flutist.</i>

465
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,077
Flautist.

466
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,959
<i>I gotta draw a lieutenant
who plays the "flaute."</i>

467
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,833
Hey. Knock it off, you men.

468
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,839
<i>I'm a German.</i>

469
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,952
All right.

470
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,759
You knock it off too.

471
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,832
- May I a criticism make?
- No.

472
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,754
<i>The " Brahms' Lullaby" goes:</i>

473
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,319
Not:

474
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,034
I studied music in London.

475
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,193
- What are you doing here?
- Surrounding the castle.

476
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,432
- What century is it?
- 20th, for chrissake.

477
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,150
He means the castle.

478
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,912
Tenth.

479
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,276
Beckman says the north wing is 15th.

480
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,314
Lionel Beckman, the art historian?

481
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,431
- Yeah.
- Have you read his book...

482
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,556
<i>... Twelfth-Century Iv ory Miniatures?</i>

483
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,075
<i>- It's wonderful.
- No, I haven't.</i>

484
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,679
Right, tell him nothing.

485
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,237
If you will throw me your flute,
I will fix it for you.

486
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,670
I studied under Mayerhorn.

487
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,396
<i>He's a good man.</i>

488
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,518
<i>He's liable to toss back a grenade.</i>

489
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,513
Never trust a Kraut.

490
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,550
<i>I'm not trusting a Kraut.</i>

491
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,279
<i>I'm trusting a colleague.</i>

492
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,393
Suppose a high-ranking officer came
and asked what you did with the flute.

493
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,278
What would you tell him?

494
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,118
The stops were not smooth.
Now listen:

495
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,790
What did you do that for?

496
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,637
<i>That's what we do for a living,
lieutenant.</i>

497
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,079
- What were these old tunnels built for?
- Escape.

498
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,512
One branch there comes out
behind Maldorais.

499
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,912
In the swamp. This one goes under
the moat to the northeast.

500
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,713
Toward the German lines.

501
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,633
<i>You're a collector, Beckman.</i>

502
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,030
I try to be selective, sir.

503
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,040
Suppose you were
without an education.

504
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,953
<i>I'd probably collect...</i>

505
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:01,510
...old string, newspapers.

506
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,154
Fallen women.

507
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,198
<i>Don't judge her, Beckman.
She's not a work of art.</i>

508
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,791
Hey.

509
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,509
- You guys hear something?
- Probably a goldfish spawning.

510
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,712
I hate myself for doing this.

511
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,429
<i>I'll come back after the war
and salvage it.</i>

512
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,955
- What do we do?
- Keep our heads.

513
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:57,509
<i>Volkswagen can't swim.
It's just showing off.</i>

514
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,632
<i>It's still showing off.</i>

515
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,674
<i>Look, if we put a bullet
right below the water line, it'll sink.</i>

516
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,235
Put one below the water line.

517
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,397
<i>- Jesus Christ, reverend, it's still alive.
- Give me that.</i>

518
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,230
<i>It won't do any good. We're dealing
with something supernatural.</i>

519
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,233
Hey. My Volkswagen.

520
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,676
<i>They're drowning her.</i>

521
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,432
<i>Through there. It's faster.</i>

522
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,519
Damn!

523
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,955
<i>I didn't know there's a stair here.</i>

524
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,112
Probably a goldfish spawning.

525
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,280
What are you gentlemen
doing down there?

526
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,309
Simplistic, lieutenant.
Play it simplistic.

527
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,436
<i>- What's that?
- Tell him we're not here.</i>

528
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,232
<i>Who's that with you, Amberjack?</i>

529
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,638
Private first class
Alistair P. Benjamin, sir.

530
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,633
- What does the P stand for?
- Pearsall, sir.

531
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,393
Have you been drinking?

532
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,838
We stopped at the Red Queen
to look for infiltrators.

533
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,151
I want you to go home,
sleep it off.

534
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,033
Will you see that Benjamin...

535
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,270
...gets to bed, Amberjack?
- Yes, sir.

536
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:06,756
Will you see the lieutenant home...

537
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,150
...Private Alistair P. Benjamin?
- Yes, sir.

538
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,713
- Sir, I have a report to make.
- Keep it simplistic.

539
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,472
Yes?

540
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,309
<i>There are three Puerto Ricans
at the Queen's.</i>

541
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,517
- New girls?
- No, sir. All soldiers.

542
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,399
<i>That's a very succinct report,
Lieutenant Amberjack.</i>

543
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,791
<i>- Good night.
- I haven't finished my report yet, sir.</i>

544
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,233
Very well, lieutenant,
finish your report.

545
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,558
The Germans have broken through
in the Ardennes.

546
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,797
Good night, gentlemen.

547
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,039
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, sir.

548
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,676
The castle is strong.
It has never failed.

549
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,319
No.

550
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,109
<i>No, and you've never failed the castle,
not in 1000 years.</i>

551
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,392
- But the end of a castle must come.
- Civilization?

552
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,753
Falconer will try to stop the army
of the Nazis right here...

553
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,434
...if it costs a castle.

554
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,158
<i>What's one castle?</i>

555
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,557
Major Falconer is mad.

556
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,714
<i>He looks like a buffalo, doesn't he?</i>

557
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:35,589
<i>Well, they've been close
to extinct for a long time.</i>

558
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,793
He could be extinct.

559
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,873
He fights that way,
out of a kind of desperate doom.

560
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,151
And I wonder who is mad.

561
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,595
Major Falconer has the war
on his side.

562
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,432
And we have history.

563
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,556
We have the truth, captain.

564
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,358
The beauty.

565
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,432
How many guns does truth have?

566
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,115
How many troops, mortars, grenades,
antitank weapons?

567
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,555
When does beauty fight?

568
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,712
And who the hell wants history
on his side?

569
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,555
We could sit here sipping wine through
the whole war and win it with words.

570
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,875
If the situation called for bravery,
I would be brave.

571
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,958
I am the bravest man I ever knew.

572
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,559
And yet...

573
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,508
<i>...l've never committed
what you would call a brave act.</i>

574
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,478
And what wars have you won?

575
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,234
Therese is pregnant.

576
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,760
We are going to have a child.

577
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:43,268
My home is a ranch on the slopes
of the Jemez Mountains.

578
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:46,348
Where you can see everything.

579
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,228
Almost 100 miles.

580
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,910
<i>It's a country of red and white mesas,
sharp arroyos...</i>

581
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,038
...and mountain meadows
that roll all the way home.

582
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,038
<i>It's a country of mud houses
and hogans and tents of the Apaches.</i>

583
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,588
And a sky that goes straight up blue
for a million miles.

584
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,788
<i>It's a country where you see
and feel so far...</i>

585
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,793
<i>...you think you've seen
and felt everything.</i>

586
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,469
Then they start a war and you
come to another planet to end it.

587
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,272
And you see all these castles.

588
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,995
<i>- What's that?
- What?</i>

589
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:34,878
A plane?

590
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,712
Listen.

591
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,071
<i>Don't do it.</i>

592
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,316
<i>Don't do it?</i>

593
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,912
<i>Don't defend the castle.</i>

594
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,395
You mean you want to save it too.

595
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,512
I want to save you.

596
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,313
You wanna save me
and you wanna save the castle.

597
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,874
I want to save you.

598
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,992
Thank you.

599
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,911
Thank you very much.

600
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,753
- Beckman.
- Yes, sir?

601
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,833
Go up on the roof. Man the.50 calibre
machine gun, shoot that bastard down.

602
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,515
<i>- Anything more, sir?
- Yes, I'll be up when I'm dressed.</i>

603
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,913
- Beckman.
- Yes, sir.

604
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,150
Do I have to take you by the hand?

605
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,072
<i>- No, but I was thinking...
- Don't think.</i>

606
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,514
Yes, sir.

607
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,796
Get your ass up on the roof.

608
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,995
<i>You're low, Beckman. Bring her up.</i>

609
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,200
<i>You're not leading, Beckman.
Lead 10 yards.</i>

610
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,430
Ignore it, Beckman. Get the engine.

611
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,357
Perfect, Beckman. Perfect.
