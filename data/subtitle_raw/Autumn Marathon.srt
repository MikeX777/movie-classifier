4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,840
"No one to fear the thunder,

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,200
"No one to hear the waves
lap at the shore?" Question mark.

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,200
"No one to scan the sky?"

7
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,760

Why did you stop?

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,760
I wish we had a child.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,920
Why?

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,080
He would be as talented as you are.

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,920
I don't have any talent,
I just translate talented writers.

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,760
He would love you so much!
We'd wait for you together.

29
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,680
- You ready?
- I'll just tell my wife.

30
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,200
Nina! We're off and running.

31
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh great! And I could've slept
another hour!

32
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,200
Hello?

33
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,000
Can't you talk?
Give a meow, at least.

34
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,000
Next time answer it yourself.

35
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,200
- Have you ever tasted these, Bill?
- Don't think I have.

36
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,000
- What do you call them?
- "Khvorost".

37
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,200
It's delicious.

38
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,360
- Nina's a very good cook.
- Don't overdo it, darling.

39
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,520
Sorry, I couldn't understand.

40
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,680
- She was talking to me.
- I was talking to him.

41
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,840
Bill, if one doesn't say anything,
why should that call be for me?

42
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,920
Pardon?

43
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,600
Maybe we'd better
not involve Bill in this?

44
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,600
I don't understand.

45
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,920
- She was talking to me.
- I was talking to him.

46
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
Hello?

47
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,000
Bouzykine, your Alla has just
waked me up

48
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,840
and asked me to tell you
to call her up immediately.

49
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,360
You forgot your manuscript
at her place.

50
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,400
I can't do it right now.
I'm loaded up with work.

51
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,760
I get it. Nina is with you.

52
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,200
All right. I'll call her back
myself.

53
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,520
- I don't think you should do it.
- Yes, I should. Bye.

54
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,280
That was Viriguine, my editor.
Rushing me up, as usual.

55
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,760
- Is it like this in Denmark too?
- Oh yes.

56
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,920
Don't you think his voice
was rather feminine?

57
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,600
- Whose voice?
- Your Veriguine's.

58
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,440
He was calling through
his secretary.

59
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,600
Do you like it? Nina made it
herself.

60
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,240
Delicious.
It is jam, yes?

61
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,400
No, it's called "preserves".
Excuse me.

62
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,760
Andrei, she seems a little angry.

63
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,920
I better go or I better stay?

64
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,960
- Which would make it easier?
- No, it's nothing.

65
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,200
She's just not feeling well.

66
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,600
- Goodbye, Bill.
- Goodbye.

67
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,760
Andrei will now entertain you
alone.

68
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,920
Nina, you want me to go shopping?
I'll have time after my seminar.

69
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,200
Go buy flowers for that secretary.

70
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,840
She's gone off to work.

71
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,000
Andrei, perhaps you have work too?

72
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,200
Perhaps I'm taking your time?

73
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,200
No, not at all.

74
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,000
Bill, I've read it.

75
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,360
Everything is fine, but there are
a few inaccuracies.

76
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,200
Right here, as far as I remember,
Dostoyevsky writes:

77
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:17,760
"You should take your medicine
and learn to like it".

78
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,200
You say "take your pill".
He means: Take what you've got

79
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,440
coming and like it. It's slang.

80
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,200
Excuse me.

81
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,480
Hello?

82
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,520
Bouzykine, she's crazy,
our typist.

83
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,200
I called her to explain
what the situation was.

84
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,680
She told me to shut up

85
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,000
and that you should get lost
and never come again.

86
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,360
Maybe I'd better go there?

87
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,840
Don't you dare! Who asked you
to meddle in the first place?

88
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,000
All right. Bye.

89
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,880
Now I understand.
It's a colloquial expression.

90
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,200
Yeah, a colloquial expression.

91
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm sorry, Bill,
now I have to go to the Institute.

92
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,920
Can I ask you just one more
simple question?

93
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,440
- Sure.
- Just a second, I've got to look.

94
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,360
- Morning.
- Good morning.

95
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,080
- What's up?
- Shershavnikov is coming.

96
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,280
- Why are you hiding from him?
- Don't want to greet the bastard.

97
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,280
Why not?

98
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,200
- D'you know what he did yesterday?
- No.

99
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,000
He got Kluchansky fired,
Semyonov promoted,

100
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,600
and now Efimov is going
to be Vice-president.

101
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,200
Good morning, Vladimir.

102
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,600
- Have you seen Novikov?
- No, I haven't.

103
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,200
Hi! How are you today?

104
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,200
- Tell him I was looking for him.
- Right.

105
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:21,360
May I speak to Alla, please?

106
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,920
She's not here, they sent her home.
She had chest pains.

107
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,840
Yes!

108
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,840
- What's the matter? Are you sick?
- It's nothing. A few little pains.

109
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,000
- You should call a doctor.
- He's already been here.

110
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,840
- What did he say?
- He said I should rest a day or two.

111
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,320
- Well then, rest.
- I'm resting.

112
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,640
What's Varvara been telling you?

113
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
- Nothing new.
- What'd she say exactly?

114
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,680
She said that you and Nina were
a very devoted couple,

115
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:58,200
that you'd lived together like two
lovebirds for an eternity,

116
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,360
that you'd feel awful
if you did anything to hurt her.

117
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,520
I know all of that, but to hear it
from somebody else...

118
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,600
- You should've hung up on her.
- That's what I did. It was so awful.

119
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,080
- Is she having an affair?
- Who? Varvara?

120
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,640
Your Nina, of course.

121
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,440
No, I don't think so.

122
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,280
Why then she would sow that
button with the wrong color thread?

123
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,440
- What button?
- This one, on your belly.

124
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,000
- Yeah, really.
- See? Take off your coat.

125
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,760
Time to go home.

126
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,440
No. I've got to go see my publisher,
that's all.

127
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,840
Excellent, Andrei.
Excellent, as always.

128
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,600
- Thanks, I'm glad.
- And I'm not!

129
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,280
- Why not?
- I'm turning it down.

130
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,680
Turning it down? Why?

131
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,840
That Simon just published
an article with racist overtones.

132
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,200
The progressives are putting up
a hell of stink about it.

133
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,520
It's hardly the moment to puff him
up by printing his work.

134
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,480
In what shape is "Fragmented Moon"?

135
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,200
- In fragments.
- What do you mean, in fragments?

136
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,360
It's on my calendar: The tenth,
Bouzykine, "Fragmented Moon".

137
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,000
And today's the ninth.
It's due tomorrow.

138
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,200
I can't possibly make it.

139
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,200
All right.
The thirteenth is your deadline.

140
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,520
I'll do what I can.

141
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,200
I'll have to work day and night.

142
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:48,520
Do it. It would be better for you
than chasing women, at your age.

143
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,200
What d'you mean, women?

144
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,440
Leningrad is a small town.

145
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,000
Nina, I'll be home a little late
today. We've got another meeting.

146
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,200
It's very impolite, you know. He's
been waiting for you for 2 hours.

147
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,360
You promised to take him
to Dostoyevsky's house.

148
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,520
Oh damn! I'm on my way.

149
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,680
- Where are you now?
- I told you, at a meeting.

150
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,200
I thought your meetings were
on Thursday.

151
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,440
I'll explain when I get home.
They're knocking on the phone booth.

152
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,760
- Phone booth? At your meeting?
- I really have to go.

153
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,200
Young man!
You forgot your flowers.

154
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,840
Thanks a lot!

155
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,600
Flowers and medicine, and this...

156
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,200
I've got to go now. Hansen's
waiting for me.

157
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,600
How about your button?

158
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,000
- He's been waiting for 2 hours...
- Just a sec. You can eat meanwhile.

159
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,520
- Why'd you do that?
- I knew you'd be hungry.

160
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,440
Andrei, who does your daughter
look like?

161
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,600
Is she more like you or her?

162
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,000
Not like either of us. Dropped out
of college. Hardly comes to see us.

163
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,440
And her husband is a funny guy.

164
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,600
I've tried to talk to him,
but it's hopeless.

165
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,000
You see?
And if we had a...

166
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,760
He would respect you...

167
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,280
All right, I'll be quiet. Eat.

168
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
- Yes?
- May I come in?

169
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,160
Of course, Uncle Kolia.

170
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,600
- Well, how is our cardiac case?
- Much better, thank you.

171
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,200
- Hello, Andrei, how are you?
- Hello, Nikolay Afanasievich.

172
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,840
Look at that poor girl. It's just
nerves, that's what it is.

173
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,200
Andrei is in a rush. A professor
from Denmark is waiting for him.

174
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,920
- Go ahead and eat.
- Thank you.

175
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,920
Andrei's helping him
translate Dostoyevsky.

176
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:51,280
- You know Danish too?
- Not much. My language is English.

177
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,360
Don't you think that Andrei looks
like a rabbit when he eats?

178
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,600
What a thing to say.
He eats like a normal person.

179
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,280
Alla, I have something to say
to you...

180
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,000
Sooner or later, this ordeal
of yours will come to an end.

181
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,200
You will be able to formalize
your relationship...

182
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,840
Uncle Kolia, why bring that up?

183
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,000
Andrei, am I saying something
wrong?

184
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,680
No, not at all.

185
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,680
I want you to know

186
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,840
that her father was my closest
friend.

187
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:53,760
Now that he's gone, I consider
Alla like my own daughter.

188
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,200
Otherwise, I'd never dream of
interfering. It's your business.

189
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,360
Uncle Kolia, I beg you not to...

190
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,000
Wait a minute. Let me finish.

191
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,520
When you finally make up your
minds, I'll move out to the country

192
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,680
and you can have my room.

193
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,200
Thus, this whole apartment
will be yours.

194
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,520
What an idiotic idea!

195
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,680
I've said my piece.

196
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,840
I'm sorry, I won't disturb you
any longer.

197
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,000
Goodbye.

198
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,920
Andrei, I'm terribly
sorry about all that.

199
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,000
I just couldn't tell him
that you're...

200
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,200
I understand.

201
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,760
- May I go now?
- Yes.

202
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,600
I'm off.

203
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,200
Take off your jacket.

204
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,600
- Why?
- 'Cause I want you to.

205
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,760
Turn around!

206
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,200
And no peeking.

207
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,200
Your arms...

208
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,360
- Now look! Do you like it?
- It's beautiful!

209
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,200
Thanks.

210
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,600
- You shouldn't have done it.
- I want you to look fashionable.

211
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,520
That's all! Go now.

212
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:56,200
Would you mind if I left it here?
I mean...

213
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,680
What shall I say when I get home?

214
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,600
You mad?

215
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,000
No, I understand. You have no rights
there, but you can do anything here!

216
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,680
- Go!
- I'm not leaving!

217
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,360
Go home. You'll be late.

218
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,000
- Can't I visit a sick friend?
- I don't know about your rights!

219
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,600
- I'll call up and say I'll be late.
- Remember to talk quietly.

220
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,080
Uncle Kolia doesn't know
how thoroughly married you are.

221
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,680
Looking for a bathroom?

222
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,640
Go right ahead, feel at home.

223
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,840
Thank you.

224
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,360
If you want to wash up,
I've put a fresh towel in there.

225
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,520
Thank you.

226
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,840
Andrei?

227
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,000
It's Yevdokimov's jacket.
Too small for him, so I took it.

228
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,200
I thought Victor might like it.

229
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,200
- Where've you been?
- Who, me?

230
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,200
At Yevdokimov's.

231
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,640
It was his birthday.

232
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,760
I tried to call you...

233
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,200
But I couldn't get a connection,

234
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,000
and then I couldn't catch a taxi.

235
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,520
And the drawbridge was up.
Why do they do that every night?

236
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,520
Go to bed. I put the sheets
on the sofa for you.

237
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,360
I'll put the jacket inside
the piano.

238
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,760
Lena and Victor will come and
start to play, and Io, no sound.

239
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What's the matter? They'll look
into the piano, and surprise!

240
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,760
Nobody needs me... nobody.

241
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,760
- What?
- Nobody.

242
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,200
I was with a friend to celebrate
his birthday. Is it a crime?

243
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,000
Save your breath. I called.

244
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,360
- You called?
- Yes, I called Yevdokimov.

245
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,200
It feels so awful when nobody
needs you.

246
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,720
It's not true. I need you. Lena
does. Your work needs you.

247
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,200
No, not even Lena needs me
any more.

248
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,000
I bought some curtains for them,
and they said it's not their style.

249
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:46,080
- I'm just a burden to everyone.
- I wasn't at Yevdokimov's...

250
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,600
Where were you?

251
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,760
It's hard for me to tell you this.

252
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,200
Just say it. You're a man.

253
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,600
It may be hard at first, but then
it will be easier for everyone.

254
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,240
I was in the drying-out clinic.

255
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,200
They give you these things
over there?

256
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,200
It's Yevdokimov's jacket.
He bought it abroad.

257
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,760
- May I?
- Sure.

258
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,440
And that's the end of that!

259
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,080
Dad! What are you doing here?

260
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,280
Is that how you dress in this
weather? You'll catch a cold.

261
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,200
Your mother put her heart into
choosing these curtains, and you...

262
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,200
Why should I have to live with
something I don't like?

263
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,520
You should think
of other people's feelings.

264
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,520
You must not only receive,
but give as well.

265
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,600
I'll be only glad to. Here!

266
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,920
Put up those curtains
and go back to school.

267
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:47,520
Your mother's in an awful state
because of you.

268
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,680
Oh, so it's because of me?

269
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,840
- Who else?
- You.

270
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,240
Yermakova, telephone.

271
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,600
- Alla?
- Yes, darling.

272
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,200
I won't be able to come over
today.

273
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,000
Why not?

274
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,200
Well, there are some problems...

275
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,000
Come over after your problems.

276
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,000
No, it'll be too late.

277
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,520
Oh, someone wants to use
the phone. I'll call you, alright?

278
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,920
Andrei! One, two, inhale!
One, two, exhale!

279
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,520
- Hello, Nina!
- Hello, Bill!

280
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,840
The place is a little mess.

281
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,200
I decided we needed new
wallpaper.

282
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,200
It was too gloomy in here.

283
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,200
A good idea.

284
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,200
I think it'll look beautiful.

285
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,920
"Why look at me with such
sadness and reproach, my boy?

286
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,920
Did it not take courage to act in
such a cowardly manner, my lad?"

287
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,360
Said he to Smith and then he ran
and ran away.

288
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,000
Well, Lifanov,
I'm sorry but

289
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,840
in my opinion, this is word for
word, not a real translation.

290
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,760
I'm looking for new ways of
phrasing.

291
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
This isn't new phrasing,
it's plain sloppiness.

292
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,000
For instance, you've got "ran"
and then "ran away".

293
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,200
Couldn't you come up with
a better word?

294
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,520
Please, try to think of different
ways to express "run away".

295
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,200
- Beat it.
- Make tracks.

296
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,600
- Cut and run!
- Disappear.

297
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,200
Not bad.
Disappear how?

298
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,720
You tell us, Lifanov.

299
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,200
- Fast.
- Fast.

300
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,000
- Another way?
- Well... very fast.

301
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,200
Kovalev?

302
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,200
At full speed.
In full sail. Flat out.

303
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,760
- Selyanina?
- Headlong!

304
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,440
- Ilyinskaya?
- Without looking back!

305
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,640
- You have one, Natasha?
- Head over heels!

306
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,840
Alla...

307
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,200
- Hi!
- Hi!

308
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,200
Andrei, you walked out on me,
didn't you?

309
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,840
Everything's been piling up at once.
The book, my teaching, Hansen...

310
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,600
You might've phoned me, at least.

311
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,200
I've been sitting by the phone
all week waiting for your call.

312
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,440
- Andrei, can I give you a lift?
- No, thank you.

313
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

314
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,200
- One of your students?
- No, not his.

315
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,760
Well. Take care.

316
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,760
Goodbye!

317
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,520
Alla!

318
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,000
- Andrei, please!
- Let's talk.

319
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,600
You're the man who, out of pity, cuts
his dog's tail off a bit at a time.

320
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,160
It hurts like hell. Stop doing it.

321
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,840
Alla, you've got it all wrong.

322
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,560
Stop for a second.

323
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,840
- Let me explain.
- I don't want to hear it.

324
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,000
Give my regards to Nina!

325
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,200
You blind or what, man?
Don't you see the car coming?

326
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,200
I'm sorry. I wasn't looking.

327
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,000
And if I had killed you?
You want me to end up in prison?

328
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,840
It was my fault. I'm sorry.

329
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,600
What did he do to you?

330
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,200
- I'm the one who ran into him.
- Shake your head.

331
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,360
- Do you feel dizzy?
- I've been thinking...

332
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,280
- Hey, you! Come see this.
- What do you want? See what?

333
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,440
- Don't meddle in.
- Why not?

334
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,000
- I'm messing up your life...
- Wait a minute, Andrei.

335
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,200
You see that dent?
What are we going to do about it?

336
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,680
- How could he hit his head in there?
- He charged like a bull moose!

337
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,200
Get out of here before
I called the police.

338
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,520
You ran over an innocent citizen,
and you've got the nerve to...

339
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,000
Keep your nose out of it, or you'll
get something to remember me by...

340
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,200
Hey, what are you doing?

341
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,000
Okay, you punched me first.
That's good.

342
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,600
- Please, don't fight...
- Keep out of this, girl.

343
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,520
- I'll take care of him myself...
- Andrei, stop it!

344
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,600
What are you doing? Help me,
somebody!

345
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,840
First he ran over a man
and now he wants to kill him.

346
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,920
- Please help, somebody!
- Hey! I got him!

347
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,200
He's not the one, idiot.
Hey, you could break his arm!

348
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,400
That's right! I saw it!

349
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,600
- Let him go!
- Idiot.

350
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,680
Are you crazy or what?

351
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,840
This one? Call the police.

352
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,600
Bouzykine, don't ask me
how I knew you were there.

353
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,760
I guess you two lovebirds
made up again, eh?

354
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You'll split a gut when you hear
this. They refused my book again.

355
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,440
They said it had no style.

356
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,200
I can't think. I'm a big blank.
Please, come and help me.

357
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,200
- Sorry, I can't come right now.
- Come later.

358
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,560
- I can't come later, either.
- Then it means I'm sunk.

359
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,520
She hung up on me.

360
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,200
- What did this Thumbelina want?
- She wanted me to help her.

361
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,200
- And what did you say?
- I said I couldn't.

362
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,200
Bully for you! You can't go on
slaving for her all your life.

363
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,360
She's not really as bad as that.
Just a bit crazy.

364
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,640
She was fired from her teaching job.

365
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,760
Crazy like you?

366
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,240
- Well?
- Very nice!

367
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,760
What's nice?

368
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,600
This...

369
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,840
You're so observant!
I made myself a new skirt!

370
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:54,360
- She sews! She cooks!
- Yes!

371
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,640
- She types!
- Yes!

372
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,200
- She washes clothes! She saves!
- Yes!

373
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,360
And she breaks your heart.

374
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,840
And she loves you. Where else
could you find another like her?

375
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,920
That's it. My time is up.

376
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,600
I was supposed to go to the housing
bureau. They want me to speak there.

377
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,000
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

378
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,200
The hell with them. I'm not going.

379
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,200
Will you do me a favor? Don't get
scared. It's not about the baby.

380
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,840
Would you make me a present
of that stupid watch?

381
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,760
Sure.

382
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,600
No one will hear that ghastly
buzzing sound again.

383
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,160
- Zhenya, why don't you say hello?
- I didn't see you.

384
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,520
You looked me right in the eye.

385
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,000
Andrei, I want you to meet
Zhenya Ptashuk.

386
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,600
- Ptashuk.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Bouzykine.

387
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,000
And this is Andrei Bouzykine.
I recited his sonnets at the dacha.

388
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,360
- It was a translation.
- Who cares, they were your words.

389
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,000
We've just been at a cafe.

390
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,520
- Oh, really?
- Uhu!

391
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:32,000
- Well, I've got to go.
- We should go too. Goodbye.

392
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:44,760
Why do you never wear the jacket
I gave you?

393
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,760
If I wear it every day, I'll get it
soiled.

394
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,080
Go ahead, get it soiled.
It will remind you of me.

395
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,360
- Put it on tomorrow!
- All right.

396
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,680
Do you know why he pretended
not to see me?

397
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,680
I think he is in love with me.

398
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,360
He called twice and invited me
to go to the theatre with him.

399
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,520
- Did you?
- I turned him down.

400
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,920
- Why?
- Unfortunately, I'm a one-man woman.

401
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,080
What does she live on? It beats me.

402
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,680
- Who?
- Varya.

403
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,440
- Who is Varya?
- Varvara, you know.

404
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,200
This year they accepted only one of
her stories, after a great effort.

405
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,680
Your effort.

406
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,360
She could work as an Intourist
guide.

407
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,000
Instead of torturing yourself,
you'd better go and help her.

408
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,920
- And leave you here all alone?
- I'm not a child.

409
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,080
Come on, go!

410
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:16,600
All right, let's do it this way.
You go and see the movie.

411
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:19,760
I'm running to Varvara's,
help her with two or three phrases,

412
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,360
and after the show I'll meet you
downstairs by the billboard.

413
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,520
Is it really all that bad?

414
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,200
- Why bad?
- You've crossed out everything.

415
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,000
Well, just some minor things.

416
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,840
"The goat gave an inhuman squeal".
That's a little too much, isn't it?

417
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,600
So what kind of squeal?

418
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,520
Just simply: "The goat squealed".

419
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,200
Tell me, Bouzykine...

420
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:27,000
- Am I that hopeless?
- No, not at all.

421
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,200
Who does better translations?
Me or Shitova?

422
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,760
- You, of course.
- Then how come I never...

423
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,600
- Hello?
- Hello, Varvara?

424
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,440
Hold on a second, will you?

425
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,520
Hi!

426
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,680
No, he's gone. He went home.

427
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,200
Not at all, dear.

428
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,120
- Want a drink?
- No, thanks.

429
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,120
And I like it when I'm working.

430
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,040
A stimulant.

431
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,800
Are you out of your mind?
You've started all over again.

432
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,240
- It's all junk.
- For me, it will do.

433
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,640
It's way past midnight,
and we've got a load of work.

434
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,400
- What d'you mean, past midnight?
- Well, it's twenty to midnight.

435
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,240
Oh no! This is terrible!
Alla's waiting, I was to meet her.

436
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,960
Forget it! She called,
and I told her you'd gone home.

437
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,760
- Why?
- Because.

438
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,040
How I pity that little idiot.

439
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:14,960
You'll fool her till she's 40 and
then dump her, as my Boris did.

440
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,040
Hello! Alla darling, it's me!

441
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,480
When you called me up earlier,
she said I was not here.

442
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,800
Only I was here and I'm still here,
and since you have my watch...

443
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,720
She hung up on me.

444
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:45,240
Nina, it's me.
Look, I was working with Varvara,

445
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,480
and just as I ran up to
the drawbridge they raised it...

446
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,720
- You ready?
- Ready!

447
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,880
Andrei, step up!

448
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,880
Go to hell.

449
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,240
- Andrei?
- Yes?

450
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,040
A little question.
How to translate this?

451
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,240
Here, Chapter 12.

452
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,640
Excuse me, Bill.

453
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,240
It's Thursday.

454
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,040
Hello, Vassily, how are you?

455
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,640
- You decided to redecorate?
- A little mess.

456
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:15,560
This is Mr. Hansen,
professor from Denmark.

457
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:19,720
- I'm Kharitonov.
- Bill.

458
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,640
- Does he understand Russian?
- He does.

459
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,800
I understand, but not all the time.

460
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,640
- So you've come to the Soviet Union?
- Yes, I've come.

461
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,880
- You staying long?
- Yes, long, but leaving soon.

462
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,480
I'm like you today,
a man of leisure.

463
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,520
I work Saturdays,
so I've got Thursdays off.

464
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:58,240
You see, Vassily, we're working.

465
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:06,880
Well...
We ought to celebrate our meeting.

466
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,400
We'll pass, we really are busy.

467
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,040
This won't keep you from working.

468
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:18,040
Russian vodka! They like it.

469
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:22,640
You better get these papers off
the table. We might spot them.

470
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:25,640
Let's take it and put it down.

471
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,960
Vassily, that jacket,
where'd you get it?

472
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,400
I found it in the courtyard.

473
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,960
In that Denmark of yours, do they
throw away imported jackets?

474
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:48,040
No. It's pure cotton.
It's expensive.

475
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,400
And here, the sleeve got a little
ripped of, and out it goes.

476
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,560
Would you sell it to me?
It's too small for you.

477
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,720
I'm sorry, pal, I can't.

478
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,000
I'd give it to you for nothing, but
my wife'd think I sold it for vodka.

479
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,560
Vassily, really, maybe some other
time, eh?

480
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,960
- Don't kid me...
- We're busy...

481
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,560
It won't take much time. Well?

482
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,720
Come on, sit down.

483
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,560
Professor, you sit down, too.

484
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,320
Sit down, Bill.

485
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,040
- To the professor!
- Your health!

486
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,240
Thank you.

487
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,640
- Why isn't he drinking?
- Alcohol in the morning's not good.

488
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,720
That teeny-weeny glass?
It's just a formality.

489
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,480
Drink it up, Bill.
He'll force you to anyway.

490
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,040
Your health.

491
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,640
No, that won't do.

492
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,040
- The toasted one must drink it up.
- I don't understand.

493
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,560
I drank to you, didn't I?
That means you're the toasted one.

494
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,560
I drank all, now you must drink all.

495
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,240
That's how we do it here in Russia.

496
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,240
No more, thank you. I'm through.

497
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,240
Vassily, leave him alone.
Enough is enough.

498
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,320
I drank it. But you want all peoples
of the world to drink with you.

499
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,640
Professor, I'm insulted.

500
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,560
That's better.

501
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:09,480
No more for me.
I have work to do.

502
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,040
I can't put it back in the bottle.
What would he think of us?

503
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,320
All right, but it's the last one.

504
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,240
- Best of health.
- Best of health.

505
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,960
Your health!

506
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,240
The toasting one drinks bottoms up.

507
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,640
I'm going back to work.

508
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:46,120
That's not the proper way to do it!
You've got to stay with us.

509
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,720
Aren't we having a good time?

510
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,120
You know, I picked a big basket
of mushrooms this morning.

511
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:19,240
And where were you, lazybones?
You should go mushroom-picking.

512
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,400
Then you'd pour yourself a vodka
and have it with a mushroom.

513
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,040
And Andrei never sends his wife
out for mushrooms, either.

514
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,720
He's not educating his wife
the right way, you know.

515
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,040
Don't you forget that...

516
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:53,040
In your foreign countries, are
there mushroom forests there, too?

517
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,880
There are no mushroom forests
in foreign countries.

518
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,040
There are mushroom forests
everywhere.

519
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,720
Alright. I'm not going to rush you.
We'll replace it with something.

520
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:17,040
But what are we going to do with
Scofield? We'll get the same hassle.

521
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,240
No, you can't take that away!

522
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,800
Scofield is mine to do.
I'm begging you...

523
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,600
All right, we'll see.

524
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,240
No, that's not how it goes.

525
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:40,800
White geese are sailing to dear
Marusia...

526
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,040
Bouzykine! I had it retyped.
Now it's okay.

527
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,120
Listen!

528
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,240
"The Sad Story of a Bastard.

529
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:02,560
"The empty lot was magnet to the
neighborhood's trash, dirty and evil.

530
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,720
Old whiskey bottles,
rusty tin cans,

531
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,240
coils of wire were scattered
here and there.

532
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,640
Between two grimy poles,
the women had strung up ropes

533
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,720
which blossomed with the morning's
wash.

534
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:23,640
An old man in white garb..."

535
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:29,400
Enough talking! Go get rubber boots.
I'm lending Bill a pair of mine.

536
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:32,560
- Boots? What for?
- To go to the mushroom forest.

537
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,920
The man's never seen one. He'll
have stories to tell back home.

538
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,280
You go, if you like, but not me.

539
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,400
Just there and back.
And that's the end of it.

540
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,560
And that's the end of it.

541
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,040
- Do you like our countryside?
- Yes, very much.

542
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:06,640
Would you like to spend a couple
of days in the country?

543
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,240
I would like it very much, yes!

544
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,120
- I can arrange it.
- Thank you.

545
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,960
My cousin works in a sanatorium.
He's the head doctor.

546
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,240
It's a TB sanatorium,
but you don't have to worry.

547
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,040
My cousin's there every day, and
he's not coughing. Just say when.

548
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,480
Thank you, but I'm very busy now.

549
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,640
Maybe I had better wait
for my next visit.

550
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,040
Whatever you say. Let me know
then through my friend here.

551
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:57,640
Hey, Andrei, if you want to, I can
fix it up for you to stay there, too.

552
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,800
- No, thanks.
- You look like you need it.

553
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,960
This forest is not what it used
to be.

554
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:16,520
The jerks come here in their cars.
They've cleaned out all mushrooms.

555
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:21,560
Professor, do you own a car?

556
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,640
I own a car. Yes.

557
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:29,560
I told you, Andrei, you should buy
a car. We could've ridden here now.

558
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,880
I couldn't afford the gas.

559
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,880
There's no more forest. Let's go
back.

560
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,640
I'll bet we find mushrooms
over there.

561
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:56,480
- We can't stop now.
- No, pals, I'm going back.

562
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,040
- Professor, you want to go back?
- No, I'm fine.

563
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:07,040
I don't either. It's two against one.
We are not letting you leave.

564
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,480
What d'you mean, "not letting"?

565
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:17,400
You want to pick mushrooms,
very well. But I don't want to!

566
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:21,320
Nobody says you have to.
Just walk with us.

567
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,720
I said I don't want to pick
mushrooms.

568
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,880
And you pay no attention to me!
As if I'm not here.

569
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:33,720
We came together,
and we'll go home together.

570
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:37,240
Let's go, Bill.

571
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,880
Hold it!

572
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,040
Vassily, you're a free man.
You do as you want.

573
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,880
And Bill is also free.

574
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,040
Well, so am I free too, you hear?
And nobody's stepping on me anymore.

575
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:57,800
From now on, that's how it's
going to be. Enjoy yourselves!

576
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,720
He spoke too fast. I didn't
understand.

577
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,800
The key from my apartment!

578
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,240
Here.

579
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:20,120
Thank you very much.

580
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:30,240
Why? Because
I told him the truth.

581
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,240
- What for?
- I'm tired of lying.

582
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,240
I really was at Varvara's last
night.

583
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:47,240
You should lie to just one of us.

584
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,400
You lie here, there and everywhere.
You make more trouble for yourself.

585
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,480
Can't you stop typing when
someone's talking to you?

586
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,720
Excuse me, but I have work to do.
Now and then I even get paid for it.

587
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,880
Alla, I can get angry too, you
know... and then what?

588
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:12,560
Then you'll go back to your Nina,
and live happily ever after.

589
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,120
And I shall get married, too.

590
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,240
- Who to?
- To Ptashuk, for example.

591
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,880
Well...

592
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,880
If it would make you happy,
then I'd be glad.

593
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,320
Oh, you'd be glad?
Then I'll do it to please you.

594
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,560
Oh, Andrei, would you please
get out of here now?

595
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,880
Leave me alone, please.

596
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,120
Or I'll throw myself out of
the window.

597
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,040
All right.

598
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:18,840
But let's not be foolish
about this.

599
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,960
I had a tough day and
I don't know what I'm saying.

600
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:26,040
Tomorrow at 7 I'll be here.

601
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:30,880
I'll think about it,
and we'll make our final decision.

602
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,880
...White geese were sailing to
dear Marusia.

603
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:07,640
Come on, go flying, stop
muddying the water...

604
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,880
Whoa, boy.

605
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,880
Relax. I'll be right back.

606
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,040
Don't go away!

607
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,640
Ah, here's the head
of the household.

608
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,960
- Dad, where have you been?
- Good evening, Andrei Pavlovich.

609
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:36,400
Hello. I was playing chess
with a friend.

610
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,040
Hello, Victor.

611
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,400
Otto knew that he had only
forty minutes left...

612
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,040
- Is he going to just sit all 40 min.?
- No, Hans will come along.

613
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,400
They're going away.

614
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,800
Where?

615
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,560
To the Island of Zhokhov.
Station number eight.

616
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,960
- Where's this Island of Zhokhov?
- Near the North Pole.

617
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:29,240
- They're kidding, aren't they?
- No.

618
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:34,120
Their hydrologist got sick,
so they offered me his job.

619
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,400
We fly up there tomorrow.

620
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:41,040
You'll let them go, like that?

621
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,400
No, I won't allow you to go.

622
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:49,040
We got the plane tickets already,
and the contract's been signed.

623
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:52,880
It's only for two years. We'll be
back before you finish redecorating.

624
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:58,040
Lena, here comes Hans.
Now they'll crack the safe.

625
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,720
Forget your Hans for a minute.

626
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:11,920
Now, I want to make a tape of
you two. Dad, sit next to mom.

627
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,040
Even closer...

628
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,560
Now sing.

629
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:27,040
- Do you want us to do a dance too?
- It's something to remember you by.

630
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:30,560
We're taping everyone,
for us to play on the island.

631
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,560
You can begin.

632
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:48,480
Why do you bend so sadly...

633
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,880
No, stop, stop!

634
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,800
You're not at a funeral.
Sing something merry.

635
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,040
I don't know...

636
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:12,480
We're setting on a voyage
To faraway snow lands,

637
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:21,080
With us we take our knowledge
And good and jolly friends.

638
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:26,160
Dadada, tatata,
It is fun to have you...

639
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,400
- Alla, did I wake you?
- No.

640
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:53,240
Look, something came up...

641
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,880
Lena and Victor are going away
tomorrow morning, for two years.

642
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:04,240
So, I won't be able to come over.
Did you hear me?

643
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,480
And naturally, you've just
learned about it.

644
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:13,640
Rotten timing. I'll call you
when I get back from the airport.

645
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,240
You'll never call me here again!

646
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,560
Andrei!

647
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,880
What?

648
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:42,880
I forgot to pack the blender.
It's in the kitchen.

649
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:46,800
What can they do with a blender
over there?

650
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,880
They'll make fruit juice. Vitamins!

651
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,240
All right!

652
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,040
May I come in?

653
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:21,240
- I was asked to see you.
- Come in.

654
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:25,960
It'll only take a second.
I'm supposed to give you this.

655
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,640
And one more thing...

656
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,480
- Excuse me.
- Why, certainly.

657
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,800
Mr. Bouzykine, this is the secretary
of the housing committee.

658
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,800
Your lecture is at 7 o'clock
tonight.

659
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:52,040
- What lecture?
- A citizen's viewpoint, as promised.

660
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,640
Yes, I'll be there.

661
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,800
See you tonight.

662
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:12,400
I'm sorry, I'm really busy now.

663
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:18,040
Alla wanted me to tell you...

664
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:24,880
that you're no longer welcome
at her house. A stupid mission.

665
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,720
I'm sorry.

666
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:32,960
How do you do. May I?

667
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:38,120
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

668
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,040
- Who was that?
- Ptashuk.

669
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:47,560
- The police?
- No.

670
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,560
- Is she home?
- No, she's gone.

671
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:58,040
Andrei, bad news!
Bill was picked up for being drunk.

672
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,640
Picked up?

673
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:06,040
Yesterday we had a night cap, but
ran out of vodka. We bought some,

674
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:09,640
and ran out again. We went for more
and ran into the police.

675
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:13,800
I told them: "He's a professor from
Denmark." They just sneered.

676
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,480
He was wearing my old workpants.
I gave them to him.

677
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,680
Where is he now?

678
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,720
He's in that drying-out place,
around the corner. Disintoxication.

679
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,320
You better hurry, Andrei!
They close the doors at nine.

680
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:37,040
I really can't. Nina went to ask
for a leave of absence.

681
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,360
And I have to...

682
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,640
- Andrei!
- I have to pack everything...

683
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:43,800
- Andrei!
- I'll go there after the airport.

684
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,240
If they have him registered
at 9 o'clock,

685
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:50,880
they'll keep him there for 15 days
and send a notice to my workplace.

686
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:55,400
Who treated him to vodka?
Kharitonov. And you, too.

687
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,640
All right. I'll go.

688
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:03,640
If they ask you about me,
you tell them... well, you know...

689
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,480
I'd better be going now...
I'm due at my work...

690
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,360
You'd better put on a tie, or they'll
think you're one of those, too.

691
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,560
- Last name?
- Hansen.

692
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,240
- First name?
- Bill. Two "L's".

693
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,800
- Date of birth?
- I don't know.

694
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,880
- Don't know when you were born?
- No, when he was born.

695
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,800
- I'm asking about you.
- Why me?

696
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:41,880
He's got no documents on him.
Somebody has to pay the fine.

697
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:48,040
Bouzykine, Andrei,
born in 1933.

698
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,640
Officer, can we make it fast?
My daughter's taking a plane soon.

699
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,400
Your name?

700
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,280
He didn't slept in last night.

701
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,040
- He's right here.
- That's right. Me.

702
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,040
Would you please make it fast?
I've got a taxi waiting.

703
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,880
It's hard to recognize him.

704
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:14,800
- I learned many new words there...
- I'm sure you did...

705
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,400
- I made a list.
- Yes, yes, of course.

706
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,480
After you.

707
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:27,800
- Andrei, I was a loosh?
- A lush.

708
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,240
- And you a chaser?
- That's what I'm.

709
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:41,880
Look, Bill, take a bath and go
to bed. I have to run now.

710
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,040
Andrei!

711
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,800
Aren't we having a good time?

712
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:06,400
Excuse me, has the flight for
Anderma taken off yet?

713
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:08,240
No, but all the passengers have
boarded.

714
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:11,400
- Where do I go?
- Gate one, you better hurry!

715
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:35,120
Here we are, alone again.

716
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,640
- Not "we". Me.
- Me too.

717
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,640
Stop pretending, Andrei.

718
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:51,240
You probably think that
I'm so Ionely and unhappy now

719
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:55,400
and that you must make an effort
to be home more often to help.

720
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,560
Well, just forget that.

721
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,800
I closed my eyes to your playing
around, not to hurt Lena.

722
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,640
Now you're completely free
to do anything you want.

723
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:10,040
Frankly, it might make it easier
if you would move out.

724
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,240
You know, lately, I'm frightened
of you.

725
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,040
Each time I think:
"Will he tell me another lie?"

726
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,240
It's enough to drive me out of
my mind.

727
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:26,040
With you gone,
maybe I could be free, too.

728
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:39,240
About my playing...
you're right... But it's finished.

729
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,240
Nina, I'm sorry.

730
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,240
Forgive me, please...

731
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:09,400
Today you could've been on time
for a change. She waited for you!

732
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:14,960
They held me up in that damn
drying-out clinic.

733
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:28,240
- Will you stop for a second?
- Don't stop.

734
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,640
- I didn't say I was in the clinic.
- What are you saying?

735
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,960
- Hansen was.
- Ah, Hansen!

736
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,920
Will you please let me out
of this bus?

737
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:46,640
- Nina!
- Don't you touch me!

738
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,800
I really was in the drying-out
clinic. I swear on Lena's head!

739
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:53,960
You dare to swear on Lena's head
when she's up in the air?

740
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,640
Take me to the city, please.

741
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:39,240
- Why are you limping, Bouzykine?
- Ah, it's nothing.

742
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:48,560
I realize it's ridiculous,
but you know

743
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,040
what Veriguine told me?

744
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,960
That my translations are better
than yours. Isn't it a riot?

745
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,120
Congratulations.

746
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:02,880
You know why I came to see you?
You planned to do Scofield's book?

747
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:07,040
Yes...

748
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:13,560
He's given it to me. I want to know
what do you think about it.

749
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:19,480
I think it's great.

750
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,720
I knew it. Shame on you.

751
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:30,640
It's my one big chance.
Bigger than I ever had.

752
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:37,280
And you want me to turn it down?

753
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,040
What do you want from me?
You have it, do it!

754
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:45,960
I just don't want you to think
I cheated you out of it.

755
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,640
You didn't cheat, okay?

756
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,800
Bouzykine, you've already
started on it, right?

757
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:56,960
Maybe you've got some notes?

758
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,880
How about letting me take a look
at them?

759
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:04,240
How about me scrubbing your
floors? I'll do it, just whistle!

760
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,560
- Good morning, Andrei.
- Morning.

761
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:16,480
- We'll meet at the club.
- Certainly.

762
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,240
- And, please, no complications.
- I know.

763
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,480
Hello, Bouzykine.

764
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,040
I won't shake hands with you.

765
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,560
- Good morning.
- How are you?

766
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,240
- Are you crazy? Why not?
- Because I won't.

767
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,640
It's not your style, Bouzykine.

768
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:47,960
I'm warning you, don't put
yourself in an awkward situation.

769
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:51,280
- Nice seeing you!
- Goodbye!

770
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:54,320
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't get it.

771
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:10,960
Would you help me with my final
paper? Or I'll lose my scholarship.

772
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:14,120
I'll do make-up work later on.

773
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,720
The code of our profession,
my dear Lifanov, is this:

774
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:21,720
We aim, in this turbulent world,

775
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:25,480
to make culture and language of
different peoples more available.

776
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:34,720
And you, with your double talk,
will just slow down the process.

777
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:40,040
The same goes for all of you.

778
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,040
In future, I do no more favors
for anyone.

779
01:19:54,720 --> 01:20:01,640
Andrei, maybe you'll change your
mind? Twenty years of marriage.

780
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:07,040
No, it's decided.

781
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:11,320
- Can I help you pack?
- I'll just grab a couple of shirts.

782
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,960
I'm sparing you the big parting
scene. Goodbye.

783
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:40,800
Yevdokimov!

784
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,640
What is it?

785
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,400
You're lucky. I'm staying here.
Nina left herself.

786
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:53,800
- What?
- She's gone! Thanks anyway.

787
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,720
Damn!

788
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:37,960
- What's going on?
- I'm relaxing.

789
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,480
With the door wide open?

790
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:55,240
Andrei, what's the place where I
slept called? Intoxication clinic?

791
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:58,240
- Disintoxication clinic.
- Disintoxication clinic?

792
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,400
- That's it. You got it.
- Thank you.

793
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,400
Any time.

794
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,320
What do you want?

795
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:12,320
- Did you go?
- I did.

796
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:18,400
- They let Hansen go?
- They did.

797
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:23,320
- Did they ask about me?
- You bet they did!

798
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,640
What did they say?

799
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,320
They said that you mix vodka
with port wine.

800
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:48,640
- So what? It's my insides.
- Well, they just said that.

801
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:55,880
Anyway, it was only half a bottle.

802
01:22:56,120 --> 01:23:01,240
Grandma says you're to come
down right this minute!

803
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:14,440
I was telling him, but he insisted
on having a cocktail. Damn hippie!

804
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,880
Yes?

805
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,560
Hello? It's me.

806
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,680
Did you call me?

807
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,480
Yes!

808
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,800
Did you come to a decision?

809
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,640
Yes.

810
01:24:59,320 --> 01:25:01,480
Well?

811
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,240
Yes.

812
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,880
You know, our phone wasn't
working.

813
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:22,400
But they fixed it and put it
in my room. Listen to this!

814
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,040
Andrei...

815
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:58,240
Is it true that your affair is
finished?

816
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,240
Yes...

817
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:19,800
- Hey! Where'd you disappear to?
- I'm with you.

818
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,800
When shall I see you?

819
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:33,040
I'll make a note of it.
Meeting at seven tomorrow.

820
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:11,480
- Andrei, you ready?
- Ready!

821
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:22,240
One-two, one-two...

822
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:42,480
