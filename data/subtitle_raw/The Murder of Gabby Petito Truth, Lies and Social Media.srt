1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,039
- So me and Brian
just got up and got ready,

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,919
made the bed in the tent...

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,559
and set up.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,920
I think our plan for today

5
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,160
is to just hang out here

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,519
in the tent.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,359
<i>- Man, that smile.</i>

8
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,840
That smile didn't change.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,280
Those eyes didn't change.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,240
I...those eyes...

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,759
they would get her
out of so much trouble.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,439
Didn't matter how old she got,

13
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,320
she would always be
my baby girl.

14
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,520
No matter what she, you know,
how much trouble she was in,

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,880
it didn't matter.

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,799
She was still my baby girl,
you know?

17
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,719
These are
all I have left now.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,119
<i>- People would meet her</i>

19
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:04,040
<i>and just fall in love</i>
<i>with her.</i>

20
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,760
<i>She just had this presence.</i>

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,359
<i>I don't know what it was.</i>
<i>It was just magical.</i>

22
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,159
<i>There's so many good memories</i>
<i>over the years,</i>

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,319
<i>but the one thing</i>
<i>that I hold dear to me</i>

24
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,680
is the hug that we had

25
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:23,000
before she left
for the trip in the driveway.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,239
<i>* *</i>

27
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,920
It's just...
It's still unbelievable.

28
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:37,680
I don't understand it.
It doesn't make sense.

29
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:39,560
<i>Sense...</i>

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,879
<i>- In June of 2021,</i>
<i>Gabby and her fiancé</i>

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,719
<i>embarked on</i>
<i>a cross-country trip.</i>

32
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,239
They were traveling in Gabby's
2012 white Ford van...

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,760
<i>* *</i>

34
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,000
<i>And documented their journey</i>
<i>on YouTube and social media.</i>

35
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,319
- Doing some morning yoga.

36
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,200
- We've been lucky so far
at all the places we've stayed.

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,719
- Oh, my God!

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,039
<i>- She maintained</i>
<i>regular contact</i>

39
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,520
<i>with her family members.</i>

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
<i>However, that communication</i>
<i>abruptly stopped</i>

41
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,439
around the end of August.

42
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,719
<i>- If you've been active on</i>
<i>TikTok or watching the news,</i>

43
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,639
you've probably
heard of Gabby Petito.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,280
<i>- Everybody's on this case.</i>
<i>Everybody's talking about it</i>

45
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,120
because
we have to find this girl.

46
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,759
<i>- The twists and turns</i>

47
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,479
throughout this case
have been bizarre.

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,280
<i>- We have this moment</i>
<i>where we see behind the scenes</i>

49
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,240
<i>of their perfect</i>
<i>Instagram van life.</i>

50
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,560
<i>- People became obsessed</i>
<i>with this case.</i>

51
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,960
<i>They wanted to find her</i>

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,719
<i>and they wanted to</i>
<i>solve this case</i>

53
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,360
<i>really more than anything.</i>

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,039
<i>- The media and the internet</i>
<i>just went crazy.</i>

55
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,599
- I am going to walk down here
a little bit

56
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,800
because I see something.

57
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,319
- Oh, my God,
there's that van.

58
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,840
<i>- Right here</i>
<i>is where they think</i>

59
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,639
that it's a shadow
of someone digging.

60
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,199
- Human remains
were discovered,

61
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,240
consistent with the description
of Gabby Petito.

62
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,000
<i>- It was like every</i>
<i>parent's nightmare just, like,</i>

63
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,360
in a flash of a second.

64
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,319
- Brian is currently
on the run and hiding.

65
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,680
<i>- He could be in</i>
<i>the Appalachian Trails.</i>

66
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,960
<i>He could be in Mexico,</i>
<i>Canada.</i>

67
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,120
- Earlier today,
investigators found

68
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,919
what appears to be
human remains.

69
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,120
<i>- The remains matched</i>
<i>the dental records</i>

70
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,080
<i>of Brian Laundrie.</i>

71
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,319
<i>- It's just been confirmed</i>
<i>the cause of death</i>

72
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,840
<i>is a gunshot wound</i>
<i>to the head,</i>

73
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:36,560
<i>and the manner of death</i>
<i>is suicide.</i>

74
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,120
<i>- There are so many questions</i>

75
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,120
<i>that we just don't have</i>
<i>answers to.</i>

76
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,919
<i>- Who is Gabby Petito?</i>
<i>- Who is Gabby Petito?</i>

77
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,919
<i>- She wasn't just a YouTuber.</i>

78
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,960
<i>She was an amazing individual,</i>
<i>and she was our daughter.</i>

79
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,919
- Gabby,
Gabrielle Venora Petito,

80
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,360
<i>was born in March 1999.</i>

81
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,520
<i>I was 20 years old,</i>
<i>so...it was scary for me.</i>

82
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,319
She was a big baby.

83
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,960
She came out crying
and ready to start life.

84
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,360
<i>It was her for the first</i>
<i>few years, just no siblings.</i>

85
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,160
So it was nice just to have
that mother-daughter bond.

86
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,519
<i>She was just</i>
<i>such a loving kid.</i>

87
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,079
<i>I mean, she would sleep</i>
<i>in the bed with me sometimes.</i>

88
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,399
She loved to snuggle,
and I don't know.

89
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:36,480
I loved all those years.

90
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,319
- I was 20 years old
when Gabby was born, you know?

91
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,319
A new baby is terrifying,
terrifying,

92
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,040
and when she was born,
I mean, she...

93
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,480
I can hold in her my hands,
you know, like, tiny.

94
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:51,920
<i>And you're responsible</i>
<i>for this perfect innocent,</i>

95
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,519
<i>you know, baby.</i>

96
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,079
It's just an instant bond
that it'll just never go away.

97
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,120
<i>She was just awesome</i>
<i>to be around, you know?</i>

98
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,839
<i>Her smile, her eyes,</i>
<i>all that stuff,</i>

99
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,920
and I just remember melting,
you know,

100
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:08,519
and she have me wrapped around
her finger quick.

101
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,759
<i>You know,</i>
<i>that didn't take long.</i>

102
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,920
That's my perfect little girl.

103
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:24,480
- Gabby was two,

104
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,120
just about turning three,

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,920
<i>when I met her</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

106
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,600
<i>She had these little,</i>
<i>like, pigtails</i>

107
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,120
<i>and you know, her blonde hair,</i>
<i>these bright blue eyes,</i>

108
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,720
<i>and she was just</i>
<i>this happy kid.</i>

109
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,040
She was pretty amazing.

110
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,240
And I saw the way
Nichole was with Gabby

111
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,040
and how amazing
of a mother she was.

112
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,199
I'm like these...
they're beautiful.

113
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,519
They're awesome.

114
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,600
<i>- Jim is just as much</i>
<i>as a dad that I am.</i>

115
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,319
Tara is the only person that
Gabby has ever seen me with,

116
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,240
that she would even remember,
you know,

117
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,759
<i>and she is just as much</i>
<i>as a mom as Nicki.</i>

118
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,680
<i>So she always had</i>
<i>four parents.</i>

119
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,680
- And I never looked at Gabby
as my stepdaughter.

120
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,920
She was my daughter.

121
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,759
<i>I started dating her father</i>
<i>when she was a year old,</i>

122
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,959
and I fell in love
with her instantly.

123
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:16,720
<i>I loved just being with her.</i>

124
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:20,319
<i>I loved spending</i>
<i>time with her.</i>

125
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,319
We used to sit there.
I used to tell her.

126
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,360
I'm like, "Gabby, I got
a secret. I got a secret.

127
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,439
I got a secret to tell you,"
and she would come running up

128
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,959
and whisper in my ear,
"I love you."

129
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,199
<i>- Blue Point is a small town.</i>
<i>It's a small school.</i>

130
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,839
<i>She had a lot of good friends.</i>

131
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,399
She was a baton twirler.

132
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,519
She did that a little bit
in her late elementary years.

133
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,240
<i>Middle school,</i>
<i>she ran some track.</i>

134
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,680
<i>You know,</i>
<i>she always tried new things.</i>

135
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,399
<i>Just a spitfire,</i>
<i>she had goals,</i>

136
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,800
and she did what
she could to get there.

137
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,120
<i>As she got older,</i>
<i>she just loved</i>

138
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,519
to take lots of pictures,
lots of videos.

139
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
<i>- When we were always</i>
<i>together,</i>

140
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,040
<i>all she wanted to do</i>
<i>was take selfies.</i>

141
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,800
She was always taking
pictures of things

142
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,040
and put her twist
of her artwork into it.

143
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,279
- She'd start uploading
pictures and videos,

144
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,680
<i>and she was putting</i>
<i>her life out there,</i>

145
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,160
<i>and she would post</i>
<i>a new picture or a new story</i>

146
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,399
<i>on Instagram</i>
<i>every couple of days.</i>

147
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,920
<i>- She wanted to put her stuff</i>

148
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,240
out there online
for people to see.

149
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,759
<i>- Gabby and Brian</i>
<i>met in high school.</i>

150
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,720
<i>- They had the same group</i>
<i>of friends in school,</i>

151
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,120
common interests, you know?

152
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,519
They liked to
do things together.

153
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,439
They're both artistic.
- Very artistic, yeah.

154
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,519
They started dating
after the first road trip,

155
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,800
the one when they took
the car to California.

156
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,519
They were kind of friends
when they left.

157
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,920
<i>* *</i>

158
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,000
Came back dating, yes.

159
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,240
<i>She was so happy.</i>

160
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,759
Gabby and Brian were dating,
and he would come to my home.

161
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,799
Brian would be there, and
he was very polite, very kind.

162
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,159
- Get your guard up as a dad,
you know,

163
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,759
especially when
it's one of your girls,

164
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,919
<i>but when he would come over,</i>
<i>he was respectful,</i>

165
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,559
very quiet, very polite,

166
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,039
and, you know, he would
actually take the time,

167
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,720
and he would, like, color
with our younger daughters

168
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,159
and stuff and talk with them.

169
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:03,360
- I didn't see anything in him
that would worry me at all.

170
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:04,480
- No.

171
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,879
<i>- When her and Brian</i>
<i>started dating,</i>

172
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,320
<i>and he was like,</i>
<i>"I'm moving to Florida,"</i>

173
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,679
and she was like,
"Can I come with you?"

174
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,080
So she had no problem
doing that.

175
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,039
She had no fear
to move to another state.

176
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,519
<i>I said, "You know,</i>

177
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:28,240
<i>"you're always welcome</i>
<i>to come back home.</i>

178
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,559
<i>If you don't like it,</i>
<i>this is your home."</i>

179
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,200
- Gabby was living with Brian

180
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,399
and his parents
in North Port, Florida.

181
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,720
- Gabby did have a close
relationship

182
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,480
with Roberta
and Chris Laundrie.

183
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,519
<i>They treated her</i>
<i>like their own daughter.</i>

184
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,360
<i>* *</i>

185
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,399
<i>- They were engaged.</i>

186
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,840
So it was exciting,
but I was like,

187
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,879
"Well, just make
sure this is...

188
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,639
"You know, you're young,
and make sure

189
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,279
it's what you want."

190
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,000
But I couldn't tell her,

191
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:17,399
you know,
you can't get married now

192
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,080
<i>because I got married</i>
<i>very young.</i>

193
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,799
- You know, as a dad,
you're like, okay, you know,

194
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,000
that's great, you know, you can
settle down a little bit.

195
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,200
<i>* *</i>

196
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,120
You're happy for her,
you know, that she's found

197
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:33,159
who she wanted to be with.

198
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,039
- We're not going
to talk about it.

199
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,440
- We're not going to
talk about it.

200
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,200
- I thought she should
finish school, get a job,

201
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,720
do all that stuff,
you know, the traditional way,

202
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,039
but she had a different plan

203
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,960
and a different vision
in her head,

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,759
and she knew what she wanted,
and she did it.

205
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,919
- And she was like, "I...

206
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,000
We got to get a van
and do this."

207
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:14,360
<i>- They were fixing up a van,</i>

208
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
<i>and they're gonna do this</i>
<i>whole van traveling thing.</i>

209
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,200
We didn't really...
kind of heard of it,

210
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,879
but we didn't know
what it was about.

211
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,320
She couldn't wait to show us.

212
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,320
And then
when she opened the doors,

213
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,320
<i>and we looked inside</i>
<i>and we saw it,</i>

214
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,960
<i>we couldn't believe it.</i>
<i>- I was like-my mouth dropped.</i>

215
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,440
- I was like,
"This is unbelievable."

216
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,080
- "You did this?"

217
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,960
<i>- Every little nook and cranny</i>
<i>of that</i>

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,120
<i>was planned out for storage,</i>

219
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,000
<i>the bed that folded up</i>
<i>into a couch,</i>

220
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,559
<i>these fold-out tables</i>
<i>that they could eat on.</i>

221
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,519
Every little piece of it was...
- Just so creative.

222
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,480
... Was so detail-oriented.

223
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,919
<i>- Everything has to</i>
<i>have a place,</i>

224
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,799
and not to the point
where it's OCD,

225
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,919
but just liked it
neat and clean.

226
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,360
That was her van.
She loved it so much.

227
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,320
- I love the van.

228
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,519
<i>* *</i>

229
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,080
<i>- I was like,</i>

230
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,320
"People don't get to live
their dreams all the time,

231
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,519
"and you're doing it.

232
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,159
"Like, this was your goal,
your dream,

233
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,720
and you saved your money

234
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,000
It's proud...
I was proud of her.

235
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,960
<i>I really was.</i>

236
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,159
<i>I have so many good memories</i>
<i>over the years,</i>

237
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,039
but the one thing
that I hold dear to me

238
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,120
is the hug that we had

239
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,159
before she left
for the trip in the driveway.

240
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,879
It was just a long, long hug.

241
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:36,600
I don't know.
I can't describe it.

242
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,519
It was just...

243
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,440
I know I was
saying goodbye for a long trip,

244
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,639
but it just felt different.
I don't know.

245
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,399
Now that I look back,
it felt so different,

246
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,360
and I squeezed her so tight,
and I said, "I love you.

247
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,120
"Please be careful.
This is going to be great.

248
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:52,159
You're going to have
so much fun."

249
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,000
And she...

250
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,600
you know,
she squeezed me back,

251
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,879
and it was just really...

252
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,519
It was great,
and I'll cherish it.

254
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:20,360

<i>started this journey together.</i>

256
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,960
When you see that
on social media, you think,

"I want to be like them."

258
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,600

<i>felt close with Gabby,</i>

259
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:36,759
getting to know her through
her Instagram or YouTube.

260
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:39,559
That's how I related to her.

261
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,080
I saw myself in Gabby.

262
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:46,399
<i>She wanted to experience</i>
<i>the world, kind.</i>

263
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,879
<i>I mean, she seemed like</i>
<i>she was always smiling</i>

264
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,960
and happy, full of life.

265
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,879
- Gabby Petito
never goes outside.

266
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,200
- As soon as you look
at Gabby Petito's Instagram,

267
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,600
it's hard to not
fall in love with this girl,

268
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,399
<i>and people started</i>
<i>watching her</i>

269
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,840
<i>and becoming a part</i>
<i>of her life.</i>

270
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,480
- Hello, hello,
and good morning.

271
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,200
It is really nice
and sunny today.

272
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,120
It's only 10:00 in the morning,

273
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:26,879
but it rained
all afternoon yesterday.

274
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,519
<i>- Gabby set up a YouTube</i>
<i>channel called Nomadic Statik.</i>

275
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,840
She wanted to document her life
on social media and eventually,

276
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:40,440
as influencers do,
make money doing it.

277
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:45,320
Gabby was
such a positive force,

278
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,440
and she did a really great job
enframing everything

279
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,519
<i>she was putting out</i>
<i>on social media</i>

280
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,519
as a positive experience.

281
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,120
- Oh, my God!

282
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,000
The tent
is just coming in on me.

283
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,960
The wind is so bad!

284
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,639
I've just been sitting here
like this for a while.

285
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,240
- We looked forward to seeing
new posts of where they'd been,

286
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:19,840
and, you know, Gabby had no
fear when it came to doing,

287
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:23,240
<i>you know, surfing the sand</i>
<i>dunes and climbing the rocks.</i>

288
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,720
<i>She just went for it.</i>

289
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,000
- Me and Brian just got up
and got ready,

290
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,879
made the bed in the tent,
and set up.

291
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,399
I think our plan for today

292
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,120
is to just hang out here
in the tent.

293
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,960
Brian's stretching,
doing some morning yoga.

294
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,120
- Brian seemed to be
a very quiet, calm person.

295
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,200
- He kind of seemed like a guy

296
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,039
who focused on being
one with the Earth.

297
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,000
- He definitely had
an affinity for art.

298
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:13,320
He did his own illustrations.

299
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,600
<i>- He liked to draw,</i>
<i>and he created some</i>

300
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,639
<i>almost comic book-like</i>
<i>sketches.</i>

301
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,399
Some of them were pretty dark.

302
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,320
<i>There was definitely an edge</i>
<i>to Brian's posts,</i>

303
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,600
<i>whereas Gabby was showing</i>
<i>these beautiful locations,</i>

304
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,200
<i>and it seemed like</i>

305
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,360
he was using it as a platform
to say something else.

in a free disperse camp spot,

and we've been lucky so far
at all the places we've stayed.

315
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,960
But I'd say this is
one of the best so far.

316
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000

<i>almost daily,</i>

00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:13,759
showing how she was living
out of this van,

318
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,039
how she was making
her own food.

319
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,319
- Now I'm going
to make some yogurt.

320
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:23,519
All the chocolate melted.
- That is so melted.

321
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:26,000
I know.
It's a river of chocolate.

322
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,960
Be cautious.

323
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,279
- You can't keep chocolate
in Utah,

324
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:34,240
not in July.

325
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,519
Or in a clear
plastic container...

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,599
enjoying these adventures
and also this beautiful life.

338
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:24,799
- But there was definitely
more to this relationship

339
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,119
than was being shown
on social media.

340
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,799
<i>* *</i>

341
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,960
<i>- Before they embarked</i>
<i>on their cross-country trip,</i>

342
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,839
<i>I've heard</i>
<i>from Gabby's friends</i>

343
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,400
<i>that Brian was a little</i>
<i>jealous and overprotective.</i>

344
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,039
I heard a specific incident
where he didn't want Gabby

345
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:54,440
hanging out
with one of her girlfriends

346
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,000
just because he didn't like her
or thought that,

347
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,160
you know, she might be
a bad influence on Gabby.

348
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,640
<i>It seemed Brian wanted Gabby</i>
<i>all to himself.</i>

349
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,480
<i>He didn't want her</i>
<i>socializing or going out.</i>

350
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,119
Hearing that from Gabby's
friend, it seemed a little odd.

351
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,400
<i>Gabby, didn't have that many</i>
<i>friends here in North Port.</i>

352
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,039
<i>She had just moved here,</i>
<i>and so for him to be,</i>

353
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,599
<i>you know,</i>
<i>that controlling at that time,</i>

354
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,839
it just seems,
you know, very manipulative.

355
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,920
<i>It seemed like one</i>
<i>of those red flags.</i>

356
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:45,599
<i>* *</i>

357
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,079
- In Utah, Gabby wrote
a postcard to Brian's nephew.

358
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,599
<i>- Looking at this postcard,</i>
<i>it's clear that Gabby</i>

359
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,359
<i>felt so connected</i>
<i>to the Laundries.</i>

360
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,119
She felt that they were
one of her own,

361
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,240
and she was one of their own.

362
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,440
- We would be in touch with her
every day, for the most part,

363
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,200
but, you know, if we were busy,
or she was busy,

364
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,240
it would be,
you know, every couple of days.

365
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,559
<i>- I had spoken to her</i>
<i>on the 24th of August.</i>

366
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,240
<i>She was in Utah.</i>

367
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,160
We were working on the website
for the Nomadic Statik stuff.

368
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,599
She was having trouble
with the email.

369
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,359
<i>So we worked on it together,</i>

370
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,079
and we got it to work
and said, "I love you,"

371
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,440
and she said,
"I love you," back,

372
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,400
and "I'll talk to you
in a couple days."

373
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,400
<i>* *</i>

374
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,599
<i>- The last text message</i>
<i>I received from her phone</i>

375
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
was on the 30th of August.

376
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,000
And it said,
"Can you call Stan?"

377
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,400
which is her grandfather,

378
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,480
who she referred
to as Grandpa normally.

379
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,119
- It was very odd to see.

380
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,559
So I said, "Okay,
there's no service happening.

381
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll leave her be."

382
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,480
And then, you know,
I told her grandfather,

383
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,799
<i>"Just let her be</i>
<i>for a few days.</i>

384
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:27,079
<i>She's in a place</i>
<i>with no service."</i>

385
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,240
And that was the last text
I received.

386
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,039
<i>- We realized</i>
<i>that's not right,</i>

387
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:39,359
and that she wasn't planning
to head to Yosemite.

388
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,960
They were planning on going
to Yellowstone in Wyoming.

389
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,599
<i>One's slightly north</i>
<i>of where they were.</i>

390
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,039
<i>The other one's</i>
<i>hundreds miles west,</i>

391
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:50,920
and it didn't make sense.

392
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,599
<i>- And then we started</i>
<i>to worry.</i>

393
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,480
<i>And then when her mom called</i>
<i>me up and said, "Hey, listen,</i>

394
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,880
I haven't heard from her,
you know, in a few days"...

395
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:05,640
And that's when we started
making phone calls.

396
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,400
- Kept texting,
I would text every day,

397
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,319
thinking I got to get
a response at some point,

398
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,319
and that's when
I started getting worried.

399
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,240
<i>- It wasn't uncommon,</i>
<i>different parts of the trip,</i>

400
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,359
<i>depending on where they were,</i>

401
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,200
<i>where they would kind of be</i>
<i>out of range of cell services.</i>

402
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,319
So sometimes the social media
posts weren't every day,

403
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,960
<i>but they were</i>
<i>every couple days, and...</i>

404
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,519
<i>it just stopped.</i>

405
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,119
There was nothing.

406
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,680
- The thoughts that were going
through my head were,

407
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,599
"Something really bad
has happened to her,"

408
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,839
<i>whether it was an injury,</i>
<i>lost or something,</i>

409
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,960
and I needed to get
in touch with her.

410
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,759
I'm thinking maybe
they went a hike,

411
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,839
and they're hurt somewhere.

412
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,279
The worst things
are coming into my mind.

413
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,559
<i>I did text Brian's mother.</i>

414
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:06,240
<i>I said, "Have you heard</i>
<i>from the kids?"</i>

415
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:08,000
<i>I didn't say,</i>
<i>"Have you heard from Gabby?"</i>

416
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,599
<i>I was concerned</i>
<i>for both of them.</i>

417
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,000
Got no response.

418
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,720
I texted his phone,
got no response.

419
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:16,799
And, I mean, I was just like,
"What is going on?

420
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:19,200
Why would anybody
respond to me?

421
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,200
I'm asking if you've heard
from the kids,

422
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,839
and I'm getting nothing.

423
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,519
- It was like every
parent's nightmare just, like,

424
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,599
in a flash of a second,
we just went into,

425
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,880
like, autopilot
as parents, like, she's gone.

426
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,160
She's missing.

427
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:41,920
<i>* *</i>

428
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,200
<i>- Out of nowhere,</i>
<i>Brian suddenly showed back up</i>

429
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,240
in Florida in Gabby's white van
without Gabby.

430
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,200
- Brian did not inform
Gabby's parents

431
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,759
that he had
gone back to Florida.

432
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,799
<i>If they had a fight,</i>
<i>if she had met somebody else</i>

433
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:12,640
and had gone her own way,

434
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,119
why wouldn't he just call
and tell her parents about it?

435
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,559
- We started making
phone calls...

436
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:19,559
- That was...

437
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,440
<i>- To his parents,</i>

438
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,599
and no one called back,
not a text, not a voicemail,

439
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
not a missed call.
- Something wasn't right.

440
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,599
- Like, we weren't
getting anything back.

441
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,960
<i>- Finally,</i>
<i>on Saturday the 11th,</i>

442
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,079
I walked into a precinct
and say,

443
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,000
"My daughter is missing."

444
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,079
I knew the night
the detective came to my door

445
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:04,400
to tell me the van
was in Florida. I knew.

446
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:15,240
<i>* *</i>

447
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,920
- You okay?

448
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:23,400
- I knew she was gone
that night.

449
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,480
<i>* *</i>

450
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,319
When I knew
the van was in Florida,

451
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:40,880
I knew that my daughter
was gone.

452
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,799
I didn't know how,
but I just knew.

453
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:46,200
I didn't tell anyone else that

454
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,319
because I had to do
what I had to do.

455
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:50,160
I had to report her missing,

456
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,960
and, I mean, I had to get her
missing pictures out there,

457
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,119
and I just...
We had to find her.

458
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:12,519
<i>- Gabby's parents filed</i>
<i>a missing persons report</i>

459
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,200
on Friday, September 11th.

460
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,359
Brian had actually driven
the van home to Florida

461
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,039
on September 1st,

462
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,160
ten days before she was
actually reported missing.

463
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,680
<i>Had Gabby's parents known</i>

464
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,640
that Brian had come back
on September 1st without her,

465
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,400
they obviously would have
called the police much earlier.

466
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,039
<i>- Can you tell us a little bit</i>
<i>about your daughter?</i>

467
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,799
- Do it.

468
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,519
- Gabby's
22 years old.

469
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:49,799
She's an absolutely beautiful,
beautiful soul inside and out.

470
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:55,839
She's incredibly artistic,
creative, loving, caring.

471
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,559
- We love her very much,
and we miss her,

472
00:26:57,599 --> 00:26:59,279
and we want her to come home.

473
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,960
- Is there anything
you would like to say

474
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,079
directly to her?

475
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,599
- Gabby, we just want you
to come home.

476
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,640
Call us, let us know
you're okay. We just...

477
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,319
Come home, please.

478
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,079
- We miss you.

479
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:22,200
<i>It's just scary and surreal.</i>

480
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,759
You go with the motions.
You don't sleep. You don't eat.

481
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,480
You just...like a zombie.

482
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,839
- We just couldn't sleep.

483
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,480
We were up just searching
anything we could

484
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:37,279
and getting online,
trying to get the word out.

485
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:39,440
Friends and family calling.

486
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,599
Everybody offering to help,
you know, and at the time

487
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,519
we didn't even know
where to start.

488
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,480
- Brian was seen mowing his
lawn, running some errands,

489
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,000
acting very bizarrely

490
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:00,400
for somebody
whose fiancée went missing.

491
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,640
<i>- His family took him</i>
<i>on a camping trip.</i>

492
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,799
Who does that? You come home
without your fiancée.

493
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,079
You're in her vehicle,
and you go on a camping trip.

494
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,599
- Developing this morning,

495
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,400
an Instagram adventurer

496
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,240
mysteriously disappeared

497
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,119
during a cross-country road
trip with her boyfriend.

498
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,240
The boyfriend's back,
the van's recovered,

499
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,519
but there's
no Gabby Petito yet.

500
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,559
- I was hoping it was a hoax.

501
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:29,240
Like, I was.
I was, like, "So what?

502
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,559
"I'll take the brunt of it.
I'll hide you away.

503
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:34,640
"I'll shelter you somewhere,
let the media attack me.

504
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,240
"I've got big shoulders.
I'm fine, you know,

505
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,839
and I'll take care of you,
you know, whatever."

506
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,319
But...

507
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,200
- I tried to have as much hope
as possible,

508
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,039
but you still have
that gut feeling.

509
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:51,440
<i>- Night I reported her missing</i>
<i>I went onto Facebook</i>

510
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,079
and created the Find Gabby page
and just kind of shared it

511
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:58,200
<i>with everybody</i>
<i>that I'm friends with.</i>

512
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,200
<i>I said, "Please share this,</i>
<i>my daughter's missing."</i>

513
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,160
And I don't know,
by the next day,

514
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,079
it had had, like, hundreds
of thousands of shares.

515
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,799
- After that came out,
social media went crazy.

516
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:13,599
<i>- Gabby Petito.</i>
<i>- Gabby Petito.</i>

517
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,839
- We're talking about
the Gabby Petito case.

518
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,960
<i>- Gabby Petito went on</i>
<i>several...</i>

519
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,599
<i>- Brian Laundrie...</i>

520
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,480
- Everyone wants to know,
what happened to Gabby?

521
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,039
- It started going around
on TikTok and online.

522
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:25,920
"Hey, she's missing,"
got shared and shared.

523
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,400
- If you've been active
on TikTok or watching the news,

524
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,119
you've probably
heard of Gabby Petito.

525
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
- Gabby Petito's disappearance,
I want it

526
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,000
to go as far as it can go.

527
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:39,799
- It became a big story,
a big, big story.

528
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,480
- Things are changing
by the hour.

529
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,400
- And I believe if my child
was missing,

530
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,000
would I want everybody
in the country

531
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:48,559
to be talking
about my child missing? Yes.

532
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,799
- Everybody is on this case.
Everybody is talking about it

533
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:52,799
because
we have to find this girl.

534
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,400
<i>* *</i>

535
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,880
- I was covering
the story at first,

536
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,599
and Gabby was missing

537
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,640
<i>when the police from Moab,</i>
<i>Utah released a 911 call.</i>

538
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,680
- Grant County
Sheriff's Office.

539
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,200
<i>- Hi, I'd like to report</i>
<i>a domestic dispute.</i>

540
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,440
- Where's it at?
<i>- They just drove off.</i>

541
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,160
<i>They're going down</i>
<i>Main Street...</i>

542
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,720
- And what were they doing?
<i>-...but, um,</i>

543
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,200
<i>we drove by, and the gentleman</i>
<i>was slapping the girl.</i>

544
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,960
- He was slapping her?
<i>- Yes, and then we stopped.</i>

545
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,519
<i>They ran up</i>
<i>and down the sidewalk.</i>

546
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,880
<i>He proceeded to hit her,</i>
<i>hopped in the car,</i>

547
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,319
<i>and they drove off.</i>

548
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,640
- You could hear the caller
actually say that they saw

549
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,799
Brian slap Gabby and then chase
her down the sidewalk.

550
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,119
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>You said it's a white van?</i>

551
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,920
<i>- White Ford Transit.</i>

552
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,599
<i>- White Ford Transit.</i>

553
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,480
<i>So you're right there</i>
<i>by the post office?</i>

554
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,279
<i>- Right across the street,</i>
<i>yep.</i>

555
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:16,680
<i>- Okay, and when they turned</i>
<i>on to Main Street,</i>

556
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,480
<i>they went right or left?</i>

557
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:21,680
<i>- Right.</i>
<i>- Right? So they went north.</i>

558
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,279
<i>- That caller was concerned</i>
<i>enough to call 911</i>

559
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,200
and to get police out there

560
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,319
because he thought
the worst would happen.

561
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:37,359
And then the bombshell.
This video became public.

562
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,160
<i>- On September 15th, the Moab</i>
<i>Police Department in Utah,</i>

563
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,960
they released
this bodycam video.

564
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,759
- I haven't been able
to bring myself

565
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,279
to watch it, the whole thing.

566
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:55,119
- He hasn't yet.
- I can't. It's too upsetting.

567
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:03,319
- I'm sorry.

568
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,000
<i>- Earlier that day,</i>
<i>she posted to Instagram.</i>

569
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,799
<i>I would say they looked like</i>
<i>a couple very much in love,</i>

570
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:30,920
but then again it's all about
what you see on social media.

571
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,759
<i>It became very clear</i>
<i>that Gabby's Instagram photos</i>

572
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,119
<i>of the two of them just loving</i>
<i>their adventures together,</i>

573
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,240
smiling,
holding onto each other,

574
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,279
that this was hiding
a more complex

575
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:44,640
or even tumultuous
relationship.

576
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,440
<i>- It was a completely</i>
<i>different side to Gabby.</i>

577
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,519
All we've seen of Gabby
up until that point

578
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,079
were the YouTube videos

579
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,079
<i>where she was extremely</i>
<i>happy, very cheerful.</i>

580
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,440
<i>* *</i>

581
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,200
- I wanted to jump through
the screen and just hug her

582
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,559
and bring her home, but...

583
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,239
- Oh, okay, that's cool.

584
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,719
<i>* *</i>

585
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,800
<i>- So in a domestic dispute,</i>
<i>you want to get their stories,</i>

586
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,440
get their stories separate

587
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,639
so that one cannot
influence the other,

588
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,400
so that's the reason
for the separation like that.

589
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,079
- Brian appeared to be
very calm, cool and collected.

590
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,440
- The fight itself according
to Brian was because

591
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,360
he had gotten
the back of the van dirty,

592
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
and that's something that was
really important to Gabby

593
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,039
was to keep their very small,
very tight living space clean.

594
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:59,599
- Gabby didn't have the OCD
where everything had to have

595
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,679
its, you know, exact way.

596
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:05,039
You know, she wanted, you know,
she wanted things clean.

597
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,159
- She wanted...
It was her artistic vision.

598
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,400
She wanted to see things
in her artistic vision.

599
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,239
- You know, when people
talk about, yes,

600
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,079
if she had a vision
in her head for her art

601
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,079
or the way she wanted
to have something look,

602
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,679
that's one thing,
but she wanted things clean.

603
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:20,519
<i>- In the Instagram and YouTube</i>
<i>posts that Gabby</i>

604
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:23,639
<i>was putting out,</i>
<i>the van was in perfect shape.</i>

605
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:26,239
<i>It was very carefully</i>
<i>maintained.</i>

606
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,840
<i>And then during</i>
<i>that bodycam footage,</i>

607
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,719
<i>we get this glimpse inside</i>
<i>the back of the van,</i>

608
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,840
<i>and it's really</i>
<i>in a state of chaos,</i>

609
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,840
and I think that was
sort of a peek behind the veil

610
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,519
of the sort of Insta-perfect
life that they were portraying.

611
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,400
- But the interesting
piece of this is

612
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,039
that she actually
took responsibility

613
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,000
<i>saying no, she had</i>
<i>struck Brian first,</i>

614
00:38:14,039 --> 00:38:17,360
<i>that then he responded</i>
<i>by hitting her,</i>

615
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,760
and then she downplays that.

616
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,519
"Oh, it was really just
grabbing my face."

617
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,559
<i>- I feel like that's almost</i>
<i>what threw things off</i>

618
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:58,280
a little bit
is all of a sudden,

619
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,880
we're watching this,
and she's the one saying,

620
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,280
no, I started it.

621
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,880
<i>No, I'm the one</i>
<i>who hit him first</i>

622
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,480
<i>when the original 911 call</i>

623
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:10,320
was because Brian had
allegedly struck her.

624
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,679
- They decided, having spoken
to both of them

625
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,639
for about an hour,
that the best thing to do

626
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,400
<i>was just to separate them</i>
<i>for the night,</i>

627
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,360
<i>and so they put Brian</i>
<i>up in a hotel,</i>

628
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,599
<i>and Gabby was able to stay</i>
<i>with the van for the evening.</i>

629
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,239
- It was so, so eerie, yeah,
for him to say that.

630
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,360
It really chills your bones.

631
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,320
<i>- It makes me sad,</i>
<i>and I wanted to hug her.</i>

632
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,159
I think once the Moab video
came out,

633
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:11,159
you got to see
a real human behind...

634
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,480
everybody looks great
on YouTube and Instagram,

635
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,880
but people got to see,

636
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,880
"Oh, my gosh, she's
a real person with feelings,"

637
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,159
and...

638
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:22,400
<i>I think that touched</i>
<i>everyone</i>

639
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,840
<i>when they got to see</i>
<i>that she was hurting.</i>

640
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,320
Just it's amazing how so many
people could relate to her.

641
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:42,159
<i>- It was an absolutely</i>
<i>viral video,</i>

642
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,800
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>this is also really</i>

643
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,360
where the Internet detectives
in all of this came in

644
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,679
and started
to dissect this video.

645
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:54,840
- The Internet went crazy.

646
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,400
- This is a part of this story

647
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,199
that is so weird to me, okay,
that we have this moment

648
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:02,880
where we see behind
the scenes of their perfect

649
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,079
<i>Instagram van life.</i>

650
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:08,280
- She was just showing
so many signs of a woman

651
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,199
that has been
severely gaslit emotionally.

652
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,480
<i>- First of all, there's a lot</i>

653
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,119
of conjecture
around a cell phone.

654
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,079
- He clearly has a phone.
He's seen using it outside

655
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:24,599
<i>in front of the officers</i>
<i>in this exchange</i>

656
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,199
<i>while Gabby is using her phone</i>
<i>in the squad car.</i>

657
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:31,800
- It is literally 4 a.m.
Where I'm at,

658
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,360
but I cannot sleep because
of this Gabby Petito situation.

659
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,159
<i>- That Brian tells police that</i>
<i>he doesn't really have a phone</i>

660
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,599
and then he says he doesn't
have a phone which is,

661
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:42,840
like, either you do
or you don't, bro.

662
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,079
It's one or the other.

663
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:45,480
- There's just so
many questions

664
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:48,519
and people really
want answers, including me.

665
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,719
- With social media,

666
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,559
we found there's a lot
of crazy bad stuff out there,

667
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:58,079
but there's also a lot of good
stuff that can come out of it.

668
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:00,159
I always say it's like
a blessing and a curse,

669
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:02,480
but in this instance,
it was a blessing for us.

670
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:07,000
You know, a lot more great
stuff came out of it than bad.

671
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:08,960
- They're incredible,
the sleuths.

672
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,320
- Yeah, Internet sleuths.

673
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,920
- The Internet sleuths,
they do a great job.

674
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,320
They really do.

675
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,360
- I think the hashtag FindGabby
hit, like,

676
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,840
over a billion people,
you know.

677
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,079
We saw it as an opportunity
to help, you know,

678
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:24,320
get the word out there,
and it did.

679
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,960
- When we were looking
for Gabby,

680
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,280
what I would do,
I would scour Twitter,

681
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,840
Instagram and Facebook
and Reddit and YouTube

682
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,480
to find clues or tips for
the FBI and screenshot them,

683
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,960
and I probably slept
about an hour a night at best.

684
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,519
I didn't stop.

685
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,800
<i>- In addition to watching</i>
<i>the news unfold</i>

686
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,199
about what was going on
with the search for Gabby,

687
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:05,000
they were also analyzing
the posts on her social media.

688
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:06,199
<i>- The thing that stood out</i>

689
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,079
the most
was Gabby's final post.

690
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:13,679
<i>- Gabby is holding</i>
<i>a knit pumpkin in her hand,</i>

691
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:16,880
and the caption reads,
"Happy Halloween,"

692
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,320
but it's August 25th.
So it's interesting, right?

693
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:24,320
<i>- And so that was</i>
<i>really alarming to people.</i>

694
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,800
They really didn't think
she posted the image.

695
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,159
They really didn't think

696
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:31,280
that it was a recent photo
of her either.

697
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,360
<i>And then alongside that,</i>
<i>the caption had, like,</i>

698
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,159
<i>happy Halloween,</i>
<i>made absolutely no sense.</i>

699
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:37,880
And so it left people

700
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,280
scratching their heads
and confused.

701
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,639
- She didn't put any hashtags.

702
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:46,079
She normally likes
to hashtag her journey,

703
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:47,599
<i>and it was very short,</i>

704
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:04,239
<i>* *</i>

705
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,119
- On September 16th, the North
Port Police Department

706
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:09,239
held a press conference.

707
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:10,840
- Two people went on a trip.

708
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,000
One person returned,
and that person that returned

709
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:16,159
isn't providing us
any information.

710
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:19,559
<i>- So we think Brian</i>
<i>is holed up in his house</i>

711
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,239
<i>with his parents,</i>
<i>not coming out,</i>

712
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,480
<i>and on the advice</i>
<i>of their lawyer,</i>

713
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:25,760
<i>they were not speaking</i>
<i>with police as well.</i>

714
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,360
<i>As a person of interest,</i>

715
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,360
Brian still was not obligated
to talk to police.

716
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,960
<i>- A person of interest,</i>
<i>what it means is that a person</i>

717
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,719
<i>that is potentially a subject</i>
<i>in an investigation</i>

718
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,199
but that you don't have
enough information

719
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:42,159
to make that person
into a chargeable person.

720
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:43,559
So a person of interest

721
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,400
is a person that
will likely become a suspect

722
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,440
but is not currently a suspect.

723
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,800
<i>- He is the only person</i>
<i>who was on this trip with her.</i>

724
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,760
He is the only person
who is not talking right now

725
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,320
about where she might be.

726
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,719
He's not helping
with the investigation.

727
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,159
That is so suspicious.

728
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:03,320
- We are pleading with people
out there

729
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,440
to give us information,
point us in the direction

730
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,199
that we need to be
and help us find Gabby.

731
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,920
- A reporter explicitly asked,

732
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,639
"Hey, do you have know
where Brian is?"

733
00:46:16,679 --> 00:46:18,480
And the chief said,
"Yeah, we do."

734
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:20,760
- Do you know where
Brian Laundrie is right now?

735
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
- Yes.

736
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:26,159
- They said they were
respecting his rights.

737
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:28,320
They were respecting
his space as well.

738
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:33,199
- The Fifth Amendment gives
them the right not to talk

739
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:35,199
and not
to incriminate themselves,

740
00:46:35,239 --> 00:46:38,119
so under no circumstances

741
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:40,679
are they going
to be forced to talk.

742
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,360
- My focus isn't to bring Brian
in right now.

743
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,800
It's to find Gabby.

744
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,760
Brian is exercising
his constitutional rights,

745
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,800
and I have to respect that.

746
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,360
<i>- That time when we were</i>
<i>looking for Gabby was...</i>

747
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,639
it's a blur.
- Horrific.

748
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:01,079
- It's really like...
- It's horrific.

749
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,400
The whole time, we were trying
to stay as positive as possible

750
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,159
that we would find her.

751
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,800
- All right. What I need
from everybody here is help

752
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,960
because the goal
is still not met,

753
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,480
and that goal is
to bring Gabby home safe.

754
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:22,280
All right. And I'm asking
for help from everyone here.

755
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,360
I'm asking for help,
everyone at home.

756
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,599
I'm asking for help
from the parents of Brian,

757
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:31,880
and I'm asking for help of
the family members

758
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,119
and friends
of the Laundrie family as well.

759
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:39,440
You know, there is a tip line
that you can call anonymously.

760
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,360
Whatever you can do to make
sure my daughter comes home,

761
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,760
I'm asking for that help.

762
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,599
- Still in the back
of your head, you know,

763
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:51,400
that we wouldn't get
a positive outcome,

764
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,760
but we tried to still have...

765
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,039
I think that's what
we were working on.

766
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:59,159
I think that's what was
keeping us going was our hope

767
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:01,159
that we would find her.

768
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:04,519
- Anything else,
it comes second to this.

769
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:07,039
Thank you.

770
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:08,159
- We'll answer any
follow-up questions.

771
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,119
Thank you.

772
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,119
- At that point,
it was a search mission,

773
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:21,159
and it was also so fascinating

774
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,360
because I don't think
the Internet thought

775
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,480
they were trying
to help figure out a mystery.

776
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:30,360
<i>- I mean, this story has...</i>

777
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,599
<i>it's gone viral in every</i>
<i>aspect</i>

778
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:35,719
<i>from the investigation</i>
<i>side of things</i>

779
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,719
<i>to people like myself</i>
<i>that have been helping out.</i>

780
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,559
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>I'm pretty proficient</i>

781
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,679
<i>in audio-video software,</i>
<i>specifically video software,</i>

782
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:47,280
<i>so I would spend</i>
<i>the better part of the night</i>

783
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,119
<i>and the evening</i>
<i>looking for clues.</i>

784
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,480
<i>But there's a community</i>
<i>of people</i>

785
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:55,360
<i>that have all done</i>
<i>the same thing.</i>

786
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,039
It's overencompassing,
the amount of people

787
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,760
involved in this case.
It's mind-blowing.

788
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,559
- And I've seen a lot of videos
being like, "Oh,

789
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:06,119
why are people talking about
Gabby Petito case so much?"

790
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:07,480
I think a lot of it has to do

791
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:11,119
with maybe he did
just leave her somewhere.

792
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:14,119
Maybe he did just leave her
and went home.

793
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,199
Like, there is a chance
she could still be alive,

794
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:19,639
and I think people are trying
to find her safe.

795
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:22,039
- I thought maybe
I could help find her.

796
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,920
I'm really good
at the Internet.

797
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,920
I set out my mission to see
if I could find anything.

798
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,840
I looked at hundreds
and hundreds of photos,

799
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,639
zoomed in seeing if it caught
her van in the background...

800
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:40,360
<i>- The whole Internet</i>
<i>was obsessed with the case.</i>

801
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,239
<i>- Even restaurants,</i>
<i>tagged images, stores.</i>

802
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,880
<i>- A group of people and I were</i>
<i>looking through Google Images</i>

803
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,599
<i>that were posted within</i>
<i>a certain date period</i>

804
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:50,480
<i>in Jackson Hole,</i>

805
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:53,239
<i>which is where Gabby and Brian</i>
<i>were spotted at a restaurant.</i>

806
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,559
- Anything I could find,
I was looking.

807
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:00,440
Wow, on this Gabby Petito
case, so hear me out, wait.

808
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,119
I think I found something new.

809
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:05,159
I kept thinking, you know,
they were hiking.

810
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:07,760
<i>They could be on trails.</i>
<i>What are the trails?</i>

811
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,840
<i>I found a trail app,</i>
<i>AllTrails.</i>

812
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,679
Well, I found Gabby Petito's
and all the trails she saved.

813
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,360
I was like, this is crazy.
She could be in this area,

814
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,559
hoping people locally
would go look

815
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,519
or, you know, volunteers,

816
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:24,519
and then I passed it
onto the FBI as well.

817
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,559
Here we go, Grand Teton Park,
Grand Teton Park,

818
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,760
Colter Bay, Colter Bay.
Now here we go.

819
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,239
- No matter where you go,
there's always people.

820
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,280
There's always
pictures being taken.

821
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,880
They were truly never alone.

822
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,840
- Now starts north
of Colter Bay,

823
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,320
it goes way up
into the middle of nowhere.

824
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,719
<i>I was hoping</i>
<i>he left her somewhere,</i>

825
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,440
and people could find her.

826
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,679
Maybe she was lost.
That's what I was hoping for.

827
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,079
<i>- On the morning</i>
<i>of September 17th,</i>

828
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:59,599
<i>I went to North Port outside</i>
<i>the Brian Laundrie house,</i>

829
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,639
and it was just chaotic.

830
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:07,159
- Arrest Brian! Arrest Brian!
Arrest Brian!

831
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:09,400
Bring Gabby home!

832
00:51:10,599 --> 00:51:13,880
Where's Gabby, Laundries?
Where's Gabby?

833
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,840
Where's Gabby!

834
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,800
<i>- We had residents.</i>

835
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,119
We had people really from all
over the state of Florida

836
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:23,760
in front of the Laundrie home
just yelling,

837
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,199
<i>"Hey, Brian, speak to police.</i>
<i>Tell us what's going on."</i>

838
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:29,960
Everyone believed that he was
inside of that house

839
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,559
alongside with his parents.

840
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,360
<i>- I was there for the better</i>
<i>part of the day</i>

841
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,800
until the police
started showing up.

842
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,280
<i>Us reporters, you know,</i>

843
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,960
<i>there's a gang of us</i>
<i>outside the house.</i>

844
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,559
We're standing around.

845
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,559
- Where is Gabby?
<i>- We were all so confused.</i>

846
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,880
We didn't know
what was going on.

847
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,320
We thought that the police

848
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,760
were going to bring
Brian out in handcuffs.

849
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,760
- Where's Gabby?
Where's Gabby!

850
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,639
<i>- And, you know,</i>
<i>people were yelling,</i>

851
00:51:56,679 --> 00:51:58,400
<i>and they had signs,</i>

852
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,159
<i>and it was just a circus</i>
<i>outside of the Laundrie house.</i>

853
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:06,599
It was like a scene
out of a movie.

854
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:08,159
There was so much noise.

855
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:10,760
- Where's Gabby?
Where's Gabby!

856
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,719
<i>- I see a couple</i>
<i>of police officers leave,</i>

857
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,679
<i>and we then find out</i>
<i>that his parents</i>

858
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,400
<i>were there</i>
<i>talking to the officers</i>

859
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,760
because they were filing
a missing person report,

860
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,199
so Brian was not in the house
like we had thought.

861
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:30,159
He was gone.

862
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:33,840
- I thought I couldn't be
more surprised after that.

863
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:38,760
Then the revelation that he had
been missing four days before

864
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,960
and that they had waited
four days

865
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,079
to call the police
and tell them.

866
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,360
- You think, oh,
it can't get more weird.

867
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:02,800
- Brian is now missing.
The internet went crazy.

868
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,440
- The motherlover is missing.

869
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,840
- How did Brian leave
his parents' house

870
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,239
without nobody seeing him?

871
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,960
- When I found out
about this information,

872
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,840
I was just kind of like, what
the hell is this all about?

873
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,639
- I find it so crazy
that all of a sudden,

874
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:18,400
they're saying
that Brian Laundrie

875
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,280
is a missing person as well.
He's not a suspect.

876
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,719
- How does he get away? How?

877
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,239
You have him home at his house
with his parents.

878
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,559
He's there, you know,
and he gets away?

879
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,440
He could have gotten away
any other time,

880
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,159
but he's right there.
It was crazy.

881
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:43,000
<i>- When Chris</i>
<i>and Roberta Laundrie</i>

882
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,360
did eventually tell authorities
that their son was missing,

883
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,960
they said he'd gone
to the Carlton Reserve.

884
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,199
- The 24,000-acre preserve
is about the size of Manhattan

885
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:57,599
<i>to put it in perspective,</i>

886
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:00,599
<i>and so you have</i>
<i>a starting point for Brian</i>

887
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:02,039
<i>to look for him.</i>

888
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,599
<i>It is the difficulty</i>
<i>of this area being flooded</i>

889
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:08,480
that makes this
into a very difficult case.

890
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:11,719
There are wild boar.
There are alligators.

891
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,440
There are snakes.

892
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,000
There are all kinds of dangers
there that made it difficult

893
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:19,760
for law enforcement to operate
in that environment.

894
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,239
- So we later learned
that Roberta Laundrie

895
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,559
drove Brian's Mustang
back to the family home,

896
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,880
<i>and it was at that point that</i>
<i>one of the surveillance team</i>

897
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,840
<i>from North Port Police</i>
<i>saw Mrs. Laundrie,</i>

898
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,679
thought it was Brian Laundrie
returning to the family home,

899
00:54:37,719 --> 00:54:39,760
<i>and so they were under</i>
<i>the mistaken belief</i>

900
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,039
<i>that Brian was at home.</i>

901
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:46,079
- But, you know, people want
to know, where is Brian,

902
00:54:46,119 --> 00:54:49,480
and can we get him
to tell us what happened?

903
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:55,840
- From a social media
standpoint, it amped up.

904
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,199
They really, really wanted
to find Brian.

905
00:54:58,239 --> 00:54:59,760
- It seems like the more
and more social media

906
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,159
dives into this case,

907
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:03,199
the odd eerie facts
continue to come out.

908
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:04,440
- Everybody wanted answers.

909
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,800
Everybody is thirsty
for answers.

910
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,800
- I'ma keep y'all updated

911
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,199
on everything going on.

912
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:11,079
This case has my full
attention, you guys.

913
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:12,800
<i>* *</i>

914
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,519
<i>- They're using their</i>
<i>spare time and their passion</i>

915
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:19,320
for this to,
you know, try to help.

916
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,920
- I thought, well, you
know what?

917
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,639
Maybe this is going to work.

918
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:25,199
Maybe, you know, someone is
going to come up with a clue.

919
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,719
I was not prepared

920
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,280
for the type of clue
that happened along the way.

921
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,639
- Y'all, look at this.
It's the freaking Tetons.

922
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:48,639
It's been on our bucket list
forever. I know it's been on...

923
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,480
<i>- The Bethunes are a family</i>
<i>from the Tampa area.</i>

924
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:53,199
- Pretty cool.
- Yeah, I mean,

925
00:55:53,239 --> 00:55:55,840
without the smoke, it would be,
like, even more spectacular,

926
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,079
but...

927
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,920
<i>- They're also a van life</i>
<i>family.</i>

928
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,880
They have a couple of kids,
a couple of dogs,

929
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,199
a little bit of bigger van
obviously to hold this family,

930
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,639
<i>but they were on</i>
<i>a similar trek.</i>

931
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:14,199
- Let's keep driving to our
spot, Captain, Captain Kyle.

932
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:17,679
- The Bethune family had been
traveling through

933
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:21,199
the Grand Teton National Park
in Wyoming on 27 August.

934
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:25,760
- They were also in the Grand
Tetons at the exact same time,

935
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,719
and they had a dashcam,
and then all of a sudden,

936
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,800
<i>it struck the owner</i>
<i>of that YouTube channel,</i>

937
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,440
and she was like,
hey, I think I saw that van.

938
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:38,039
So she went back, took
a closer look and there it was.

939
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:44,199
<i>- On August 27, 2021,</i>
<i>we got camera footage</i>

940
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:53,840
<i>going through the Grand Tetons</i>
<i>Park around 6 to 6:30 p.m.</i>

941
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,679
- When the YouTube video
came out with Gabby's van,

942
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,639
I was like, oh, my gosh.

943
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,039
<i>- As we're coming up on it,</i>

944
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,039
<i>we're approaching it up here</i>
<i>on the left-hand side.</i>

945
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,760
<i>This is most definitely Gabby</i>
<i>Petito's Ford Transit van.</i>

946
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,519
<i>Here it is on the left.</i>

947
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,599
<i>- But the fact that they drove</i>
<i>through at that time,</i>

948
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:20,440
<i>at that day,</i>
<i>at that precise moment</i>

949
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,440
and just happened
to hit record, it's like, wow.

950
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,840
<i>- Immediately, everyone</i>
<i>across the internet, YouTube,</i>

951
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,280
Instagram, Twitter, even TikTok
were deciphering this video.

952
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,880
<i>I was as well looking at it.</i>

953
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,000
What could you see?
What could you not see?

954
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:42,639
- If you look in the far left,

955
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:44,599
there's a little bit
of a shadow,

956
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:46,320
so somebody think
someone is digging there?

957
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:48,320
- So I zoomed in on the screen
recording

958
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,719
where people are thinking

959
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,519
that we see somebody
digging on the video.

960
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,440
- Here, let me just highlight
this right here, okay,

961
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,559
is where they think that it's
a shadow of someone digging.

962
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,000
<i>- There was a lot of things</i>
<i>going around,</i>

963
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:08,320
all kinds of weird conspiracy
theories, so I took that film.

964
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,239
I got the 4K version,

965
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,079
and I went through it
with my software

966
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:14,840
to start debunking
these theories.

967
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:22,159
<i>Putting the film</i>
<i>inside of the software</i>

968
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:23,639
<i>helped me slow things down,</i>

969
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:26,840
really clearly show
that what people were saying

970
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,440
was happening
wasn't actually happening.

971
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,679
When I zoomed in to see that,
I saw something new.

972
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,199
I was able to go through
and blow it up

973
00:58:43,239 --> 00:58:45,119
and work my magic
to stabilize it

974
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:47,440
and essentially enhance
the footage.

975
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,880
<i>When I zoomed in...</i>
<i>I saw the door close.</i>

976
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,519
It completely blew my mind
and sent a chill up my spine.

977
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:06,440
When I saw that,
I instantly knew

978
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,760
that there was life
in that van.

979
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,239
- I watched that video
of the van

980
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,880
and seeing the door closing,
like, probably 100 times.

981
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,880
I was like, I really believed

982
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,159
that was Gabby
closing the door on the van,

983
00:59:26,199 --> 00:59:29,320
so I just kept watching it.
I don't know.

984
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:33,239
- The law enforcement agencies
were already

985
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,079
in that area searching,

986
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,199
but it just basically
helped them

987
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:40,559
pinpoint the site
where the van was.

988
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,480
<i>- And that was a giant break,</i>

989
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:48,239
and I know that the FBI were
tipped off to that location,

990
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,039
and that's why they started
their grid search.

991
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,559
That was massive.

992
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,280
- I think everybody was still
at that point in time

993
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,880
holding onto a little bit
of hope

994
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:01,360
that maybe it was an accident,
or something happened.

995
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,519
She disappeared.
She's hiding.

996
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:07,480
<i>- I was in Wyoming when</i>
<i>they were looking for Gabby.</i>

997
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:09,000
<i>It struck me pretty quickly</i>

998
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,639
<i>that it was unlikely</i>
<i>that she was just lost.</i>

999
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:15,639
It could be 80 degrees
in the middle of the afternoon,

1000
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:19,320
but at night it got as cold
as 27 degrees, you know.

1001
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,599
It was a very big
temperature swing,

1002
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:25,079
and I just can't imagine
anyone being able to survive

1003
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:27,920
that without the proper
camping gear,

1004
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,639
you know, without shelter.

1005
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:45,519
- So a body has been found
in the area

1006
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:48,559
that they were searching
for Gabby Petito.

1007
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:57,480
Now I can't say this is Gabby
or not, but if it is,

1008
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:00,079
it makes me really sad
because I was hoping.

1009
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:06,199
I was really hoping by chance
they could find her alive.

1010
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,480
<i>- Earlier today, human remains</i>
<i>were discovered</i>

1011
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:13,280
consistent
with the description

1012
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,719
of Gabrielle "Gabby" Petito.

1013
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,360
<i>Full forensic identification</i>
<i>has not been completed</i>

1014
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,880
to confirm 100 percent
that we found Gabby,

1015
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,079
but her family has been
notified of this discovery.

1016
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,760
- So when Gabby was found,
you know,

1017
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,880
there still was some testing
that needed to be done,

1018
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:36,519
but based on the stuff
that she was wearing,

1019
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,639
we were confident
in what was being said to us

1020
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:41,159
and what was being
relayed to us.

1021
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:43,119
- You still don't want
to believe it.

1022
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:45,480
You still don't
want to hear it.

1023
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:49,199
Your body goes in complete
and utter shock

1024
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:51,639
that you're hearing
this information,

1025
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:56,320
and it's like
your whole world is destroyed.

1026
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:00,920
- The hope goes away.
- The hope.

1027
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:05,800
- First and foremost,
on behalf of the FBI personnel

1028
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:09,199
and our partners,
I would like to extend sincere

1029
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:13,480
and heartfelt condolences
to Gabby's family.

1030
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,559
- Even though I knew I was
going to get the call,

1031
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:19,199
I just didn't want the call.

1032
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,639
- Once they discovered
Gabby's body in Wyoming,

1033
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:50,440
the focus of the story then
immediately turned to Brian.

1034
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,440
Where is Brian Laundrie,

1035
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,960
and is he going
to get arrested?

1036
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,079
<i>- We still at that point</i>
<i>didn't know how Gabby died.</i>

1037
01:03:05,679 --> 01:03:08,320
Did she accidentally fall
and hit her head, you know?

1038
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:13,679
Did something happen?
It became a intense inquiry.

1039
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:17,280
<i>Where is Brian, and what does</i>
<i>he have to tell us?</i>

1040
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,599
- The anger just from
the public,

1041
01:03:19,639 --> 01:03:23,480
it was all pointed
towards Brian's parents.

1042
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,039
- There were journalists camped
outside the front of the house

1043
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:28,480
trying to get answers,

1044
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:31,320
<i>being stonewalled</i>
<i>by the Laundrie parents.</i>

1045
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,280
<i>- The FBI is on a manhunt</i>
<i>for Brian Laundrie.</i>

1046
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,480
<i>To search the terrain</i>
<i>in someplace</i>

1047
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:50,360
like the Carlton Reserve
is so difficult.

1048
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,440
The number one thing
you need is manpower.

1049
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,960
<i>You need the proper vehicles,</i>

1050
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,679
<i>and drones are crucial</i>
<i>in this case</i>

1051
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:02,519
because they have special
devices that can be used

1052
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,679
to track things
like heat, heat of a human.

1053
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:09,840
<i>- There were multiple</i>
<i>K-9 units from surrounding</i>

1054
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,800
<i>police departments</i>
<i>that all came into North Port</i>

1055
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,679
<i>in order to conduct</i>
<i>this search.</i>

1056
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:20,079
ATVs, swamp buggies, more
vehicles than I could name

1057
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:21,480
were coming in
and out of the park,

1058
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:23,039
and you could tell it
was one of those efforts

1059
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:25,199
where they were going to search
every single corner

1060
01:04:25,239 --> 01:04:26,800
<i>of it no matter what.</i>

1061
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,440
They were also focused on those
walking trails very close

1062
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,119
to the entrance of the park
that Brian was known to go.

1063
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:36,639
- Brian was very upset
when he left,

1064
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:40,679
and Chris conveyed to me
several times that,

1065
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:42,199
<i>you know, he wished</i>
<i>he didn't let him go,</i>

1066
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,679
<i>but he couldn't stop him.</i>

1067
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:47,239
Brian is a grown man,
young man, 22 years old.

1068
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,800
He wanted to walk out the door.

1069
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,920
He was entitled
to walk out the door.

1070
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:05,559
<i>- On Sunday, Gabby's body</i>
<i>was discovered in Wyoming.</i>

1071
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,840
By Monday morning, the FBI
was at the Laundrie home.

1072
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,960
<i>Tuesday is when we learned</i>
<i>it was indeed Gabby's body</i>

1073
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,880
<i>and that she died</i>
<i>by homicide.</i>

1074
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,800
<i>It was shocking, you know?</i>

1075
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:20,320
It was like a crescendo
of incidents.

1076
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,360
- Yeah, it was just...
It's still unbelievable.

1077
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,679
I don't understand it.

1078
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:43,119
- Yeah. It's...
- It doesn't make sense.

1079
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:47,639
- No. I have no words for it.

1080
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,000
- I know that I speak
for myself and the entire world

1081
01:05:54,039 --> 01:05:55,960
that's watching
when I say this that I wish

1082
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,800
we would have had
a better outcome.

1083
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:02,519
- We all pretty much knew this
is what they were going to say.

1084
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:07,000
Now they need to find Brian.

1085
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,639
And I hate to say this,
but I hope he's alive and well,

1086
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:14,280
<i>so he can suffer in jail</i>
<i>for the rest of his life.</i>

1087
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:23,679
<i>* *</i>

1088
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,920
- We have some huge breaking
news

1089
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,480
in the Gabby Petito case.

1090
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:35,920
<i>The FBI issued</i>
<i>a federal arrest warrant</i>

1091
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,840
<i>for Brian Laundrie.</i>

1092
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,679
- But it's not for homicide.
It's for bank fraud.

1093
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:44,880
<i>- Ten minutes to air,</i>
<i>we're all out there.</i>

1094
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:47,480
We're reading the bulletin
from the FBI

1095
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:51,880
and realizing it's for
transaction of roughly $1,000

1096
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:57,280
<i>that Brian used on</i>
<i>someone else's bank card.</i>

1097
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,559
<i>- We found out that from</i>
<i>Steven Bertolino,</i>

1098
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:02,360
the Laundrie lawyer,
that it was Gabby's

1099
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,719
bank account
that Brian had used.

1100
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:10,719
<i>- This is not the charge</i>
<i>that you're chasing Brian for.</i>

1101
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:15,559
<i>You want to get Brian for the</i>
<i>murder of his fiancée, Gabby.</i>

1102
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:20,920
But in the meantime, this is a
legal device that could be used

1103
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,440
to be able to secure future
arrest warrants

1104
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,519
or secure future
search warrants.

1105
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:31,320
- He's wanted on a federal
arrest warrant,

1106
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:33,519
and they'd be able
to detain him.

1107
01:07:33,559 --> 01:07:35,280
<i>So this was really meant,</i>
<i>I think,</i>

1108
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,239
<i>to help rev up the search.</i>

1109
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:42,000
- After that federal warrant
was issued for Brian's arrest,

1110
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:45,119
social media
went into overdrive.

1111
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,199
<i>- Looking for Brian,</i>

1112
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:49,320
<i>poring through</i>
<i>his Pinterest accounts,</i>

1113
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,440
<i>his Spotify playlists,</i>

1114
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:53,480
anything
really to search for signs

1115
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:55,239
about where he might be.

1116
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:04,559
<i>- When an Instagram Live</i>
<i>was made for 3 seconds,</i>

1117
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:07,480
<i>and all you saw was someone</i>
<i>in a boat and a body of water,</i>

1118
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:10,400
they all speculated
that that was Brian.

1119
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,320
He's on the run,
and he's taunting people.

1120
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,920
<i>- He appeared on Instagram</i>
<i>Live accidentally</i>

1121
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,520
<i>for two to three seconds,</i>

1122
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,479
<i>and viewers saw water,</i>
<i>as if he were on a boat.</i>

1123
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:24,800
- The Internet erupted.
Social media went crazy.

1124
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:29,079
- Two seconds in a boat
surrounded by water.

1125
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:31,640
- If you go live, doesn't it
show you where you are?

1126
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:36,680
So...My gut tells me tonight
this guy is going to be found.

1127
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,119
- There was someone sitting
there,

1128
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:41,000
clearly a foot
with a camo Croc shoe,

1129
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:43,520
<i>and people were saying,</i>
<i>"Oh, well, is this a sign</i>

1130
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,560
that Brian Laundrie
is still alive?"

1131
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,920
This is fake. I know it's fake,
and I'm going to find it.

1132
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,319
I have to find the original.

1133
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:57,479
- You guys want to know
where that screen recording

1134
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,560
of Brian Laundrie
on the boat actually came from?

1135
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,479
I'll tell you.
It didn't come from Brian.

1136
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,880
I found the original video

1137
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:07,640
was from a TikToker
from Florida from 2020.

1138
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:11,000
<i>Someone...he had taken just</i>
<i>a little snippet of the video</i>

1139
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:15,800
<i>and used that to claim it was</i>
<i>Brian Laundrie on a boat.</i>

1140
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,760
Brian Laundrie did not
accidentally go live.

1141
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,119
There's multiple buttons
you have to press to do that.

1142
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:23,680
- It's quite possible that they
are just posting these videos

1143
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,920
to get more viewers.

1144
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,159
<i>- I've learned two things</i>
<i>from this.</i>

1145
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:32,880
<i>Social media can help, but it</i>
<i>can also hurt with rumors</i>

1146
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,600
<i>and false accusations</i>
<i>and things like that.</i>

1147
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,960
<i>They're not sorry</i>
<i>for what they do.</i>

1148
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,439
People believe it.

1149
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:41,399
They fall for it because
everyone wants, you know,

1150
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,079
something crazier out of this.

1151
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:45,680
It has to get crazier.
People like that.

1152
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,680
<i>- On September 26th,</i>
<i>before Gabby's remains</i>

1153
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,640
<i>were even able to be</i>
<i>brought back to New York,</i>

1154
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:13,760
<i>her family held</i>
<i>a memorial service for her,</i>

1155
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,359
<i>and it was</i>
<i>a very touching ceremony.</i>

1156
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:20,399
They put it out on a live link
so people could watch.

1157
01:10:20,439 --> 01:10:25,560
- Gabby is the most
amazing person I've ever met.

1158
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,279
So if you're going
to leave here today,

1159
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:30,560
I'm asking that
you guys be inspired

1160
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,279
by the way she treated people,
all people.

1161
01:10:33,319 --> 01:10:35,239
- You had people turning up
to the memorial

1162
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:36,520
who didn't know Gabby

1163
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:38,800
but just felt
a connection to her.

1164
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:41,279
<i>You had people tuning in</i>
<i>online</i>

1165
01:10:41,319 --> 01:10:43,039
<i>who really needed to grieve,</i>

1166
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:46,720
<i>who really felt connected to</i>
<i>her and to this tragic case.</i>

1167
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:50,079
<i>- And it was a beautiful day.</i>
<i>It was...</i>

1168
01:10:50,119 --> 01:10:51,600
The funeral home
did a great job,

1169
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:54,600
and all of the people
that came out supported us.

1170
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,119
It was amazing.

1171
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:59,239
It was a really, really
beautiful tribute to her life.

1172
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:04,800
- This trip you guys
want to take, take it now.

1173
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,920
<i>Do it now</i>
<i>while you got the time.</i>

1174
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,600
<i>If there is a relationship</i>
<i>that you're in that</i>

1175
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:14,760
<i>might not be the best thing</i>
<i>for you, leave it now.</i>

1176
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:21,359
- Get out, get out
before it's too late.

1177
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:23,399
I mean, you can't help
but wonder if he was

1178
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:26,800
directly referring to,
you know, Gabby's situation.

1179
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:30,880
- He did tell me to shut up.
- After Gabby's memorial,

1180
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,000
there was an intense feeling
of frustration

1181
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,079
<i>among the public about,</i>
<i>where is Brian Laundrie?</i>

1182
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:39,880
You know, we'd seen
the body cam footage from Moab.

1183
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,600
- He, like, grabbed my face
and was, like, like this.

1184
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,439
- There was just
an intense desire

1185
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:04,239
<i>* *</i>

1186
01:12:04,279 --> 01:12:07,239
<i>- They said Gabby died</i>
<i>by homicide fairly quickly</i>

1187
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:11,600
after her body was discovered,
but we never knew how she died.

1188
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,399
We had to wait three weeks
for that information.

1189
01:12:14,439 --> 01:12:16,199
- The Teton County
Coroner Office

1190
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:17,880
is filing the following verdict

1191
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,920
in the death
of Gabrielle Venora Petito.

1192
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:25,000
We hereby find the cause
and manner of death to be,

1193
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:26,560
the cause...

1194
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:31,000
death by strangulation,
and manner is homicide.

1195
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:33,920
<i>Her body was outside</i>
<i>in the wilderness</i>

1196
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,840
<i>for three to four weeks.</i>

1197
01:12:37,039 --> 01:12:39,279
- He wouldn't say much
during that announcement,

1198
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:41,159
citing state laws.

1199
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:43,600
He wouldn't answer
big questions like,

1200
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:45,960
<i>what state was her body in?</i>

1201
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,720
<i>- But at the end he slips.</i>

1202
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:53,119
Somebody asks him, "You've done
missing person cases before.

1203
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:54,520
"Have you ever dealt with
a case

1204
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,119
that has received
this much media attention?"

1205
01:12:56,159 --> 01:13:01,399
- Unfortunately, this is only
one of many deaths

1206
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:05,239
around the country of people

1207
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,159
who are involved
in domestic violence.

1208
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:10,359
- He characterizes this
as a domestic violence case.

1209
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,520
He doesn't say who did it,

1210
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,359
but, you know,
the internet went crazy.

1211
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:19,960
<i>- Just a warning,</i>
<i>this information</i>

1212
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,840
<i>could definitely</i>
<i>be triggering to some.</i>

1213
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:25,520
- The coroner most of the time
won't give their own thoughts

1214
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:28,800
and interpretations
of the results of their work,

1215
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:31,359
but this coroner did.

1216
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:38,159
- Now we know
some big pieces finally.

1217
01:13:38,199 --> 01:13:40,720
- There were criminal charges
against Brian Laundrie.

1218
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,760
He used Gabby Petito's
credit card,

1219
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,359
<i>but he was not</i>
<i>a criminal suspect</i>

1220
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:50,279
<i>in the case of her death</i>
<i>at that point.</i>

1221
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:52,079
- Right after this
news conference ended,

1222
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:56,119
we were emailed a copy
of the determination of death,

1223
01:13:56,159 --> 01:14:02,960
<i>and it was actually manual</i>
<i>strangulation/throttling.</i>

1224
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,399
It's a very violent
and personal death.

1225
01:14:06,439 --> 01:14:07,760
To hear that she had died

1226
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:11,520
in this horrible
and very personal way,

1227
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:16,119
I think really hurt
a lot of people.

1228
01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:19,960
<i>- The mood really just</i>
<i>changed to, who did it,</i>

1229
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,199
<i>and why is there no suspect?</i>

1230
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:24,920
Why is there no arrest warrant?

1231
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:27,920
Why are there no charges?
Really everyone was thinking,

1232
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,800
"Only Brian can provide
the answers."

1233
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:33,640
<i>- Haywood County 911.</i>

1234
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,640
<i>What's the location</i>
<i>of your emergency?</i>

1235
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,600
<i>- People were saying that</i>
<i>they saw Brian everywhere,</i>

1236
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,319
<i>and we constantly hear</i>
<i>that he's in this state</i>

1237
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:43,720
and then that state.
It becomes chaotic.

1238
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:45,439
- People thinking he could be
in the Appalachian Trails.

1239
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:49,239
<i>He could be in Mexico.</i>
<i>He could be in Canada.</i>

1240
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:50,760
<i>- He was acting funny,</i>

1241
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,880
<i>and I'm 99.99%</i>
<i>sure that was him.</i>

1242
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:58,159
- Everyone thought that

1243
01:14:58,199 --> 01:14:59,960
they were seeing
Brian Laundrie somewhere.

1244
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,359
<i>- There was a sighting of him</i>

1245
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:03,680
in a Walmart in Tillmans
Corner in Alabama.

1246
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:06,640
- There's a lot of people
that look like Brian Laundrie.

1247
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:08,439
- I don't personally think
that Brian is

1248
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:11,279
in the Carlton Reserve,
where they've been searching.

1249
01:15:11,319 --> 01:15:13,399
I think that
that was a diversion.

1250
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:19,399
<i>- But there was some</i>
<i>information they had</i>

1251
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:22,039
<i>that kept sending them back</i>
<i>to the reserve.</i>

1252
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:24,840
Every day the search
would go on for hours,

1253
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,680
and we'd be out there waiting,
and they would find nothing,

1254
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,359
like, literally
not one piece of evidence.

1255
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:33,760
<i>And so a lot of us</i>
<i>were questioning,</i>

1256
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,399
<i>why do they keep going back</i>
<i>to this reserve?</i>

1257
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:45,199
- We just have to believe that
they know what they're doing.

1258
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:48,119
<i>- So the manhunt continues.</i>

1259
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:53,800
Let's just all hope that
this guy is brought in alive.

1260
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:03,560
<i>- On October 19th,</i>
<i>part of the reserve</i>

1261
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,039
<i>was open to the public</i>

1262
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:07,399
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>since this all began.</i>

1263
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:09,960
That marked an end
to a chapter in the story.

1264
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,560
They had been searching this
place for more than a month.

1265
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,520
They haven't been able
to find anything.

1266
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,319
<i>They're going to open it</i>
<i>to the public now.</i>

1267
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:20,439
<i>What I wasn't prepared for was</i>
<i>the day after it was opened,</i>

1268
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:22,000
<i>that Chris</i>
<i>and Roberta Laundrie,</i>

1269
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:25,199
while searching with the FBI,
found some of Brian's

1270
01:16:25,239 --> 01:16:28,840
belongings,
his backpack and a notebook.

1271
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,039
- And it was quite soon
after that

1272
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:33,479
<i>that the human</i>
<i>remains were located.</i>

1273
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:43,600
<i>* *</i>

1274
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:47,520
- According to the
Laundrie attorney,

1275
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,640
Brian's parent alerted
the FBI last night

1276
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:51,159
they wanted to search the park,

1277
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:53,359
met them here this morning
and then went to a trail,

1278
01:16:53,399 --> 01:16:55,000
where they found
Brian's belongings.

1279
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:58,600
<i>- Almost within half an hour</i>
<i>to an hour,</i>

1280
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,920
they had located
Brian's backpack.

1281
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,640
<i>- And late this afternoon,</i>

1282
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,560
<i>North Port police clarified</i>
<i>exactly what they found.</i>

1283
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,560
They described it
as skeletal remains.

1284
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,479
<i>- Earlier today, investigators</i>
<i>found what appears to be</i>

1285
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:13,119
<i>human remains</i>
<i>along with personal items,</i>

1286
01:17:13,159 --> 01:17:17,880
<i>such as a backpack and notebook</i>
<i>belonging to Brian Laundrie.</i>

1287
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:19,680
I know you have
a lot of questions,

1288
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,479
but we don't have
all the answers yet.

1289
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:26,479
- Is it him? Is it not him?
Too many speculations.

1290
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,840
- It is crazy.
If this is, in fact, him,

1291
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,720
I mean, there's so many people
confirming it.

1292
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,359
Why would his parents
go there if it wasn't,

1293
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:34,880
all this kind of stuff, right?

1294
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,359
<i>- The remains that they</i>
<i>retrieved from the reserve</i>

1295
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:40,680
matched the dental records
of Brian Laundrie,

1296
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:42,319
and that's how
they were able to confirm.

1297
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:45,279
<i>- I see Twitter going,</i>
<i>like, crazy.</i>

1298
01:17:45,319 --> 01:17:46,840
And it's been confirmed.
The human remains

1299
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,359
that they found are
indeed Brian Laundrie.

1300
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:53,439
- Brian Laundrie is no more,

1301
01:17:53,479 --> 01:17:56,600
and for a lot of people,
this is a relief.

1302
01:18:02,039 --> 01:18:04,960
<i>- That was probably one of</i>
<i>the oddest days</i>

1303
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,920
<i>in my career thus far.</i>

1304
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,560
<i>The Laundries show up,</i>

1305
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,199
<i>crack of dawn</i>
<i>to the very same park</i>

1306
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:15,359
<i>that his Mustang was parked</i>
<i>at now over four weeks ago,</i>

1307
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:18,720
going back in once again
to look for their son,

1308
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:22,680
and this just happens to be
the time that they find an item

1309
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:24,520
belonging to him in a place

1310
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,279
that had already been
searched many, many times.

1311
01:18:27,319 --> 01:18:30,560
<i>- You telling me that all of</i>
<i>these trained professionals</i>

1312
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,239
<i>could not find</i>
<i>any of this stuff,</i>

1313
01:18:32,279 --> 01:18:35,560
but the father just so happened
went to the exact place

1314
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,720
where Brian Laundrie was
and found his bag?

1315
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:42,199
<i>- Everyone is like, "How</i>
<i>the heck could the parents</i>

1316

find these things

1317
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,520
when the FBI and police
have been searching?"

1318
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,079
<i>- Back in September,</i>

1319
01:18:48,119 --> 01:18:51,840
<i>the reserve was 75 percent</i>
<i>covered in water.</i>

1320
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,920

01:19:00,439 --> 01:19:03,560
<i>- They said he had gone</i>
<i>to hike trails there.</i>

1324
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,760
These were trails
that he was familiar with.

1325
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,760
<i>- That's why they were able</i>
<i>to find his belongings</i>

1326
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:12,359
and then his partial
human remains.

1327
01:19:12,399 --> 01:19:14,439
<i>- The items that</i>
<i>were located today</i>

1328
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:16,640
<i>perhaps couldn't be seen.</i>

1329
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:19,439
We're not just saying it.
I'm not just saying it.

1330
01:19:19,479 --> 01:19:22,600
The FBI is saying it.
Everyone is saying it,

1331
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,479
<i>and yet these platforms</i>
<i>are still running amok</i>

1332
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,760
<i>with these ludicrous</i>
<i>and, I have to say,</i>

1333
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,840
you know,
nonsensical theories

1334
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,520
of the parents
planting things there.

1335
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,880
I mean, enough is enough.

1336
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,680
<i>The Laundries have been</i>
<i>cooperating with</i>

1337
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:41,520
<i>law enforcement both locally</i>

1338
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:45,119
<i>and federally since day one</i>
<i>with respect to Brian.</i>

1339
01:19:45,159 --> 01:19:47,479
- So the notebook
may be the key.

1340
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,920
It could tell us what went
through Brian Laundrie's mind,

1341
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,600
what his actions were,
why he did what he did.

1342
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,039
It could provide a confession.

1343
01:19:57,079 --> 01:20:01,439
That confession
will lock him in to the crime,

1344
01:20:01,479 --> 01:20:04,840
but we may never know
exactly what was in there.

1345
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,640
<i>- I really don't know</i>
<i>what justice for Gabby</i>

1346
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:12,960
<i>looks like at this point.</i>

1347
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,079
The one person who probably
knows what happened

1348
01:20:16,119 --> 01:20:18,159
and why she died is dead.

1349
01:20:18,199 --> 01:20:22,159
- This is tragic, but I will
tell you this tragedy

1350
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:25,439
brings us all together,
and the end result is one team,

1351
01:20:25,479 --> 01:20:28,680
one family working
to bring closure.

1352
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:31,039
Again, our thoughts and prayers
are with the family members,

1353
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:33,319
and it's a tragedy.
Thank you.

1354
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:36,319
<i>- You cannot try</i>
<i>a dead person.</i>

1355
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:40,399
<i>So there is no case that is</i>
<i>going to be brought forward</i>

1356
01:20:40,439 --> 01:20:42,680
<i>against Brian Laundrie</i>
<i>in this matter.</i>

1357
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:45,319
If there's no criminal
investigation,

1358
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:48,319
there's no criminal prosecution
in this case

1359
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:49,960
that is going to be
brought forward.

1360
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,600
<i>For the most part, this case</i>
<i>is, in reality, ended.</i>

1361
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,640
- Okay, so it's just
been confirmed

1362
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,560
that the cause of death is
a gunshot wound to the head,

1363
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,560
and the manner of death
is suicide.

1364
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,479
This is in relation
to Brian Laundrie.

1365
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,520
- This case was one of
those things that just...

1366
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,119
it was crazy
from the beginning,

1367
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,680
from the get-go.

1368
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,119
But there it is. But there's
more questions, right?

1369
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:29,960
Where's the gun?
Where is the gun?

1370
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,760
<i>I mean, they told us</i>
<i>everything else they found.</i>

1371
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:32,960
<i>Why didn't they say,</i>
<i>"We found a gun, as well"?</i>

1372
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,760
<i>Why didn't they say that?</i>

1373
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,159
<i>Why are they not able to get</i>
<i>anything from the notebook?</i>

1374
01:21:36,199 --> 01:21:37,720
Like, where's that update?

1375
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,960
Is the end of the case
for Gabby?

1376
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:45,159
- We may never know why,
now that they're both dead.

1377
01:21:45,199 --> 01:21:47,760
We may never know
why this happened

1378
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,359
<i>and why it had</i>
<i>to end this tragically.</i>

1379
01:21:50,399 --> 01:21:57,600
<i>* *</i>

1380
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,439
<i>- Gabby's story got</i>
<i>a lot of attention,</i>

1381
01:22:07,479 --> 01:22:09,920
and everyone deserves
a lot of attention,

1382
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:11,760
especially if they go missing.

1383
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:29,039
- I want Gabby's legacy
to prevent this

1384
01:22:29,079 --> 01:22:30,760
from happening to someone else.

1385
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:36,760
Even if it's just one,
that's something. That's a lot.

1386
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:40,520
<i>- We received a tremendous</i>
<i>outpouring of support</i>

1387
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,560
from our community,
from our friends,

1388
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,880
our family, from people
all across the world,

1389
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,399
and we were very lucky
to have that,

1390
01:22:48,439 --> 01:22:51,000
and we want to be
able to use the platform

1391
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:56,560
that we made for Gabby
as that voice for other people.

1392
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:01,119
- It's amazing how many people
have reached out to us,

1393
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:05,680
either saying their story
or how Gabby inspired them

1394
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:09,920
<i>to leave</i>
<i>an abusive relationship.</i>

1395
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:14,119
It makes you feel, like, that
her light did reach the world.

1396
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:19,399
Her light, her bright beautiful
light touched a lot of people.

1397
01:23:20,439 --> 01:23:25,680
<i>- You see how much the planet</i>
<i>has come together for Gabby.</i>

1398
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:30,479
So we should do that
for others, too,

1399
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:34,960
because everybody deserves
to feel safe at home.

1400
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,199
Everybody deserves to be found
that is missing, everyone.

1401
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:44,439
<i>- It makes me proud of her</i>

1402
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:47,640
that she put
herself out there,

1403
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,399
and everybody fell
in love with her,

1404
01:23:49,439 --> 01:23:51,760
and I am just
really proud of her.

1405
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:56,479
<i>Her and her legacy are gonna</i>
<i>do so much to help everyone.</i>

1406
01:23:57,239 --> 01:23:58,600
- I miss seeing her.

1407
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:02,560
I miss hugging her.
I miss calling her.

1408
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:05,279
I miss hearing her say,
"I love you, too."

1409
01:24:05,319 --> 01:24:08,680
- Gabby Petito
never goes outside.

1410
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,800
- I find myself watching
that video that she had online

1411
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,159
just
so I can hear her voice again.

1412
01:24:18,199 --> 01:24:21,800
- The tent is just
coming in on me.

1413
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,399
The wind is so bad!

1414
01:24:26,079 --> 01:24:28,600
- Just so I can hear her.

1415
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,319
- I've just been sitting here
like this for a while.
