NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,297
Hey, big guy!

3
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,757
Oh, you're such a cute boy!

4
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,840
Hi!

5
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,638
<i>Ivana, my darling.
What on earth happened?</i>

6
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,309
<i>I've been calling you all day.
I even sent you a WhatsApp text message.</i>

7
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,020
<i>It's easier to get hold of the Pope!</i>

8
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,689
<i>Don't forget the dress fitting
for your brother's wedding.</i>

9
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,067
<i>You better be there, missy!
Mwah, mwah, mwah.</i>

10
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,902
<i>Momma loves you. Bye!</i>

11
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,614
<i>Ivana,
have you lost your cell again?</i>

12
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,116
<i>Jeez, you're always so damn clumsy.</i>

13
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,868
<i>Well, not my problem anymore.</i>

14
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,161
Yeah, that's for sure.

15
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,289
<i>Look, today is my day to be with Dino.</i>

16
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,832
<i>I'll pick him up later.</i>

17
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:26,169
My God. I wish you could've had
a better man for a father.

18
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,629
My bad.

19
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,547
My bad.

20
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,716
<i>Hello, Home.</i>

21
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,719
<i>Am I calling "Home"?</i>

22
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,807
<i>You don't know me,
I just found your cell phone.</i>

23
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,894
<i>So I'm calling the "Home" number
on your contact list.</i>

24
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,106
<i>I assume that's where the owner lives.</i>

25
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,108
<i>Well, I can get it back to you.</i>

26
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,943
<i>So, Home...</i>

27
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,821
<i>...when you get home, call me.
I mean, call yourself.</i>

28
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,281
<i>So just call your number and I'll pick up.</i>

29
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,618
- Hello, Home?
<i>- That's me, Home.</i>

30
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,498
Thank goodness you came across my phone.
My entire life's in there.

31
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,125
- I know.
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

32
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,793
<i>You've been through my photos?</i>

33
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,711
Oh, my God. I gotta get a password.

34
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,505
No, I didn't. No need to worry.

35
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,383
<i>I was at the coffee shop.
I saw you leaving it behind.</i>

36
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,554
I tried to run and give it to you,
but some horse beast dragged you away.

37
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,431
- Ah. Who? Dino?
- That's what you call that monster?

38
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,352
Come on.
Don't say that. He's a cutie.

39
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,854
A little bulky, that's all.

40
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,064
<i>I love my baby boy very much, you know?</i>

41
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,691
I also have a baby of my own.

42
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,359
Oh, yeah? What kind?

43
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,360
Human one!

44
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,238
A 19-year-old mutt named Manu.

45
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,739
<i>So you...</i>

46
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,534
<i>What's your name?
I shouldn't keep calling you "Home."</i>

47
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,869
No, Ivana.

48
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:41,952
I'm Ricardo,

49
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,288
<i>but people call me Lion.</i>

50
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,998
You gotta be kidding me!

51
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:49,294
No, it's fine.
I guess you can call me whatever you like.

52
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,005
Peacock, killer whale, or even piglet...

53
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,049
No, that's not it.
My bathtub started overflowing.

54
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,426
Right...

55
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,523
- Lion?
<i>- Lion?</i>

56
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,275
<i>You used to call me Tiger.</i>

57
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,195
What is it, Danilo?
Hurry up, I'm waiting on a call.

58
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,278
<i>From?</i>

59
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,114
None of your business.

60
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,366
<i>Why didn't you pick up your phone?</i>

61
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,287
- I lost it.
<i>- Again? That's the third time this year.</i>

62
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,165
Danilo, listen to me. We are divorced now.

63
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,000
We're divorced now.

64
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,085
My phone is my business, not yours.

65
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,047
<i>Okay. I'm on my way to pick up Dino.</i>

66
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,673
- Not tonight.
<i>- I'm on my way.</i>

67
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,967
<i>And I'm gonna need some dog food.</i>

68
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,719
You're such a cheapskate!

69
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,680
My dog is not going over there
so you can forget to feed him.

70
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,432
<i>I'll sue you so I can see my dog.</i>

71
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,935
Go ahead and sue me already. He's my baby.

72
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,354
That bastard.

73
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,690
No one's gonna take you away
from Mommy. No one.

74
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,990
- Lion?
- <i>Hey! Hi!</i>

75
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,242
You fixed your problem?

76
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,534
Which one?

77
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,119
<i>Well, your bathtub.</i>

78
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,288
Oh, yeah that. That's been fixed.

79
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,539
There's others, huh?

80
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,166
Well, I don't even know you.

81
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,627
Well, if that's an invitation,
then I'm in.

82
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,130
Maybe we can have lunch tomorrow?
Or a coffee?

83
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,966
Listen, I'd really love to, but...

84
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,468
I have to give back your phone. Remember?

85
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,551
Okay.

86
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:22,804
Okay. We'll get coffee.

87
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,264
Marvelous.

88
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,933
Tomorrow morning at 10:00
at the same coffee shop.

89
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,645
It's a deal. Oh, by the way,
how am I supposed to know if it's you?

90
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,355
I've seen you, remember?

91
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,107
<i>See you tomorrow, Home!</i>

00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:45,910

An espresso.

99
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,316
- Short or tall?
- Short.

100
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,399
I like it short.

<i>Brazil awaits

00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,285
<i>scheduled to take place this morning.</i>

104
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,337
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

105
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:45,761
Oh...

106
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,643
God, no!

107
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,863
SAVE THE PLANET

108
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,365
Oh, ridiculous...

109
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,703
Home?

110
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,541
I'm right down here...

111
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,043
Am I too late?

112
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:30,848
I'm really glad we met up again, you know?

113
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,393
Met up again?

114
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,644
Oh, yeah, right!

115
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,312
We did meet. You had seen me.

116
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,272
Another short?

117
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,735
Short? No, I'll have a tall one this time.

118
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:43,819
Short for you?

119
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,114
Uh, just a water for me, thank you.

120
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,493
You have something to say
but can't find the words, right?

121
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,996
Sagittarius.
I could see you were wondering!

122
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,501
First things first, right?

123
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,461
So, here's your phone.

124
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,921
Oh, thank you.

125
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,005
My ID.

126
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,510
- ID, but why?
- To show you that I'm a grown man.

127
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:12,890
Thank you.

128
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:15,892
Indeed.

129
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,019
So, what do you do?

130
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,440
- I'm an attorney.
- Oh, are you now?

131
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,526
Yeah, I specialize in divorce litigation.

132
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,697
Broken hearts are my specialty,
so if you need me, you have my number.

133
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,574
- No, I'm not married.
- Good.

134
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,534
Seriously, good for you.

135
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,828
Marriages are awful.
I don't recommend them.

136
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,914
A piece of advice from an attorney.
Never get married, never!

137
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:37,998
I'm a widower.

138
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,542
Oh...

139
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,045
- Sorry.
- Oh, no. Not at all.

140
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,924
But if I do get married again
and it fails, I'll know who to call, huh?

141
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,761
What do you do?

142
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,347
I also work with broken hearts.

143
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,057
Actually, I work as a surgeon.

144
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,434
Well, in fact...

145
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,936
Let me see something. Hang on.

146
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,604
Your hand.

147
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,649
Hm...

148
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,027
Uh-huh...

149
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,528
What? Am I okay?

150
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,281
You're good, relax.

151
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,366
"Relax."

152
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,828
I'm having a hard time
with Danilo hanging around...

153
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,663
Danilo? Who's Danilo?

154
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,832
Danilo is my ex.

155
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,835
My ex, as well as my future ex-associate.

156
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,421
But he is one of these people
who is always so...

157
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,632
Difficult. Difficult!

158
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,676
So that's why you're so stressed out?

159
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,554
Yeah, that too.

160
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,805
But it's not just that.

161
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,308
I'm getting divorced, so I'm moving out.

162
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,311
And my new apartment is littered
with all these boxes.

163
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,647
I'm looking for another office.

164
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,275
I'm so overwhelmed, I just feel like
throwing everything to the wind.

165
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,194
- You know?
- Well, you know...

166
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,863
I might just be able to help you.

167
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,447
Just one second.

168
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,161
My dear Doctor Jairo!

169
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,039
Do you think
you could squeeze me in? Let's say,

170
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,375
in about an hour? Oh, yeah?

171
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,501
For two people.

172
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,047
Perfect, perfect. That's great. Great!

173
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,423
Okay, okay. Bye.

174
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:11,883
Shall we?

175
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:13,426
Where are we going?

176
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,221
Are you afraid of heights?

177
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,433
Oh, my God!

178
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,978
What do you think?

179
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,021
You told me this was some kind of therapy.

180
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,107
Yes, Jairo is my therapist.

181
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,609
You said you felt like
throwing it all to the wind.

182
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,819
I wasn't being literal!

183
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,363
- It's beautiful!
- You're crazy!

184
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,740
I'm not crazy, I'm unforgettable.

185
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,159
Oh, my God! I gotta get down.

186
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,744
I wanna get down. Go back!

187
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,289
We'll be down in just a bit,
down that way.

188
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,959
No, if I jump, I'll die.
I have a dog to take care of.

189
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,794
And my brother's wedding to go to.

190
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,922
If I die before his wedding,
my mom's gonna kill me!

191
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,007
Three!

192
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,677
- No! Don't let me go!
- Two!

193
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,597
Ivana, from this point on,
you're stuck with me.

194
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
One!

195
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,394
Woo-hoo!

196
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,689
Look at that!

197
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,316
Whoa!

198
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,860
- Isn't this just beautiful?
- No, no, no!

199
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:11,943
No!

200
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,655
I haven't even opened my eyes though!

201
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,157
Don't do that. Open them up!

202
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,492
You're missing the best part of it!

203
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,248
Beautiful, right?

204
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:27,043
Everything looks
so small from up here, right?

205
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,295
It's beautiful!

206
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,219
But I did it! I really did it!

207
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,972
I can't believe
that I actually did it!

208
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,184
It's wonderful! Wonderful!

209
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,353
I told you it was.
Are you feeling relieved?

210
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,897
- Of what?
- Of your problems.

211
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,542
I wasn't even thinking about all that.

212
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,818
Just a second. Hi.

213
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,404
Yes, this is Dr. Leão speaking.

214
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,158
Uh, yes, of course. I'm on my way.

215
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,702
So prep everything
and I'll be right there, okay?

216
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,704
Yeah, okay, that's fine. See you.

217
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,831
Um, Ivana, I'm so sorry,

218
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,793
but there's an emergency.
I gotta run and take care of it.

219
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,836
But I can give you a ride if you like.

220
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,921
Of course.

221
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,173
- Yeah. That'd be nice.
- Okay, good. Let's go then.

222
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,592
Well, I knew you'd love it.

223
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,514
<i>This is Sacred Heart Hospital
where the Pope is hospitalized.</i>

224
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,267
<i>No information about his situation
has been disclosed this far.</i>

225
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,521
<i>Devotees are gathering
in front of the hospital,</i>

226
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:30,356
<i>waiting for official information.</i>

227
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,446
Calm down,
everything will be fine.

228
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,784
I had the most amazing day with you.

229
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,036
And, well, I gotta run now.

230
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,164
Could we do this again?
If you want, of course.

231
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,666
Course, yeah, I'd love that.

232
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,834
I'd really love that.

233
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,418
Gotta go.

234
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,255
Wait, hang on!

235
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,756
I don't have your number.

236
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,676
I actually added my number
to your phone's contact list.

237
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,386
- Ricardo Leão.
- Ah!

238
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,221
Bye, Home.

239
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,224
So, I'm assuming

240
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,101
you've got him prepped and ready.

241
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,645
Ma'am, journalists aren't allowed
to be in here.

242
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,188
No, I'm not a reporter.

243
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,899
Who's that in there? Someone famous?

244
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,110
- It's the Pope!
- The Pope?

245
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,821
- He's not feeling well.
- The poor Pope.

246
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,699
No need to worry, he's in very good hands.

247
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,993
- Oh.
- Dr. Leão is the best.

248
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,579
- He even saved my mother-in-law.
- Oh, yeah?

249
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:28,831
Not that I wanted him to do that.

250
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,129
Are you wearing heels, Cláudia?
That's a little unfair!

251
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,090
Now, let's work a miracle, shall we?

252
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,135
They aren't looking
all that enthusiastic over there.

253
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:44,013
Now pay close attention.
A once-in-a-lifetime situation.

254
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,096
Ah...

255
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,359
Hi!

256
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,110
Am I late?

257
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,365
Ah.

258
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,034
- Well...
- W-wait...

259
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:05,951
Just a sec.

260
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,706
Do you need help?

261
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,792
No, thank you, I don't need any help.

262
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,176
<i>Habemus papam.</i>

263
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,428
Hurray!

264
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,390
Oh, hey, do you need help?

265
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,272
Dad?

266
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,650
I'm home, sweetie.

267
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,860
What's up, Dad? Look what I made.

268
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,489
Jeez, honey.
Ham, cheese and salami.

269
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,449
- Wow. Lord have mercy!
- Mm-hm.

270
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,285
May none of my patients
ever find out about this.

271
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,787
Mm! So, how was your day?

272
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,622
Mm. It was chill.

273
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,708
I met a girl, went skydiving.

274
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,127
- Operated on the Pope.
- You're kidding!

275
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,712
You met a girl?

276
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,048
Didn't you hear me say
the Pope surgery thing?

277
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,758
Who cares about the Pope?

278
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,219
Tell me about her. Is she pretty?
Can I see a photo?

279
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,971
Oh, no!

280
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,390
Give it back! Hey! Ho!
Give it back, child!

281
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,684
- Stop it!
- What's the matter?

282
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,018
Did you send her nudes?

283
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,603
Of course not. Are you crazy?

284
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,814
Wow, she's so pretty!

285
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,150
And tall. Good for you, Lion.

286
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,194
- I know, right?
- Mm-hm.

287
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,572
- So, are you asking her on a date?
- Mm.

288
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,658
Very good question. How should I do it?

289
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:31,912
Do I send her one email today
and a confirmation tomorrow?

290
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,081
Or should I send both emails tomorrow?

291
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,584
Dad, relax,
you don't have to be so anxious.

292
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,836
- Girls don't like to rush into things.
- Oh.

293
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,506
You shouldn't take too long either.
The key is to find the midway.

294
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,717
Go smoothly
and a little mystery wouldn't hurt.

295
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Ah...

296
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,429
Hey, where did you learn all of this?

297
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,180
- Google.
- Mm-hm, Google.

298
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,056
Huh.

299
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,936
<i>The Pope is still hospitalized</i>

300
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,022
<i>after undergoing an emergency surgery.</i>

301
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,190
<i>From São Paulo, Maurício Pessoa.</i>

302
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:04,236
<i>The world's attention was
on the Pope's health this afternoon.</i>

303
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,281
<i>He was hospitalized
as soon as he landed in Brazil.</i>

304
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,200
<i>Dr. Ricardo Leão was in charge,</i>

305
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,995
<i>a world-renowned cardio-thoracic surgeon.</i>

306
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,332
<i>We're here now with Dr. Ricardo Leão,</i>

307
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,044
<i>the Brazilian cardiologist
who performed surgery on the Pope.</i>

308
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,881
Tell us, Doc,
what was the Pope's situation?

309
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,216
Um...

310
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,845
His heart is simply too big.

311
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,600
<i>The Vatican's statement said
the Pope will leave hospital soon.</i>

312
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:39,229
<i>His recovery is stable
thanks to this big, little doctor.</i>

313
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,113
I bought the minibar long before
I made the mistake of marrying you.

314
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,865
- The minibar belongs to me.
- Prove it.

315
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,617
- Do you have proof?
- You want proof?

316
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,243
No. It's my word against yours.

317
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,496
I took the liberty of making an inventory

318
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,498
of all the items here, in the office.

319
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,166
Under whose orders?

320
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:02,878
No one's, but I thought it'd be good
since we're practically in a courtroom.

321
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,881
All right, well done. Now we can
do this the right way. Let's go.

322
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,051
Well, according to the records,
the transaction was made

323
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,304
long before your wedding,
and it was purchased by Ivana.

324
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,431
Therefore, the minibar belongs to her.

325
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,433
Ivana wins it and the case is closed.

326
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,103
Yeah, well, okay.
What about this painting?

327
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,938
Where's the dossier for that?

328
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:26,068
This painting was a gift
from your mom. You can have it.

329
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,277
Huh...

330
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,279
Okay, good.

331
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,698
Um, this chair?

332
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,825
Not the chair. It belonged to Grandpa.

333
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,159
- No.
- Do not go there.

334
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,370
No, honey, your grandpa truly loved me.

335
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,455
Well, according to the records,

336
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,959
Ivana's grandpa didn't actually love you.
He was merely being polite.

337
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,794
And so, that's her chair.

338
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:47,423
Fine.
You can have the chair, the minibar...

339
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,217
What about me? Do I get this stapler here?

340
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,760
It is yours actually.

341
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,429
Oh...

342
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,139
- I'm also taking Corina.
- No.

343
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,516
Corina is mine.

344
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,351
Corina, I want you to work with me.

345
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,562
Um, and what is your proposal?

346
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,440
You can start at ten in the morning.

347
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,899
I'll give you Fridays off.

348
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,986
- One-and-a-half-hour lunch break.
- 35 days paid vacation.

349
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,821
A 10% increase to your salary.

350
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,698
I'll double your salary.

351
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,451
- You prick.
- There.

352
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,411
Corina is mine, that's been settled.

353
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,538
In fact, go get me a coffee. Hurry up.

354
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,416
I think you'll be needing
to look for another assistant,

355
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,585
because I'm staying with Ivana.

356
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,272
Are you crazy?

357
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:30,257
No, it's just that Ivana is
a whole lot nicer than you.

358
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,261
You're surprised, huh?
You didn't know?

359
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,805
Okay.

360
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,725
What about the office?
Because I'm not gonna be leaving.

361
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,560
But I will. I'm leaving.

362
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,897
This office is too small for me anyway.

363
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,649
I'm gonna find a bigger one,
a better one, okay, hun?

364
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,903
- I want that in writing.
- Write the damn thing and I'll sign it.

365
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,405
This is all a terrible choice.

366
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,533
The really terrible choice was
marrying you, Danilo.

367
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,870
I woke up smiling this morning just
envisioning my bright and happy future

368
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,247
far away from you, sweetheart.

369
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,710
What is she... Happy about what?

370
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,421
What, she's...

371
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,673
...getting a divorce. Why is she happy?

372
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,551
I think you answered
that yourself.

373
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,761
ATTORNEYS AT LAW

374
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:18,514
Angela, Ivana Tavares here.

375
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,308
Listen, I need to move out
of my office right away.

376
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:24,269
If you find something in the area,
will you tell me?

377
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,397
Oh! But it has to be bigger, okay?

378
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,816
So call me. See you.

379
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,781
<i>Hey, Home, how are you?</i>

380
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:37,866
<i>So, shall we jump?</i>

381
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,665
So I'll see you in an hour.

382
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,794
Too bad.

383
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:51,213
Well, maybe it'll let up soon.

384
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,882
Ah, sure, it's not so bad.
It's just some drizzle.

385
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,471
- Afraid of thunder?
- No, no.

386
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,516
Too bad, I really wanted
to go diving with you again.

387
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,642
Yeah...

388
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,604
But maybe we can go to plan B.

389
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:09,897
And what's that?

390
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,441
Afraid of the dark?

391
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,746
Mm...

392
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,541
- Do you like it?
- Mm.

393
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,334
It's so...

394
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,588
It's so incredible, Leão.

395
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,922
You want more?

396
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,383
More?

397
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,385
I don't know if I can take it though.

398
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,304
Of course you can.

399
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,513
Mm...

400
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,526
Oh, my God!

401
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,447
It's so cool!

402
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,114
Hm.

403
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,909
But where are we?

404
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,036
This is a little slice of paradise

405
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,872
stuffed with caramel
and doused in chocolate.

406
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,417
Hang on,
I think you have a little dab here.

407
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,085
- Where is it?
- Right, here.

408
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,196
<i>Okay, Dad, then what?</i>

409
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,573
Smashed her?

410
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,201
My God, honey, come on.
There's no smashing.

411
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,703
Since it's a lady, um,

412
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,497
I'd say we got intimate.

413
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,459
- What?
- No, nothing.

414
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,044
Tell me what happened then.

415
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,672
It so happened that we shared a kiss.

416
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,632
So, how did you feel?

417
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,717
I felt this thing like...

418
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,345
- Like a shiver?
- Yeah, yeah.

419
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,721
After that, my head...

420
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,682
Was spinning?

421
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,684
Exactly, spinning.

422
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,644
Huh. So?

423
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,770
So then...

424
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,232
Suddenly, it was as if
the world just stopped.

425
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,360
And it was just us two.

426
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,320
No one else.

427
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,115
Stop saying "Eee," Manu.

428
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,825
I'm terribly sorry, Dr. Leão.

429
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,911
I think your case might be
extremely serious.

430
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,870
Hm? Why?

431
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,123
Dad, you're falling in love.

432
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,125
I'm not in love!

433
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,751
That's not what it is.

434
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,336
I'm not falling in love with her.

435
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,462
Am I?

436
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,880
- Mm-hm.
- Nah.

437
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,675
I think I am.

438
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,345
Oh, Manu, no, I'm not. No!

439
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,141
I don't know how to do this.
The last person I fell for was your mom.

440
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:53,186
- I don't know how to handle it.
- Dad, but it's just like riding a bike.

441
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,898
I can't ride a bike.
My legs can't reach the pedals.

442
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,359
Dad, come on, don't be silly,
you know what I mean.

443
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,277
I do.

444
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,487
Why don't you just open your heart to her?

445
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,116
What if she rejects the donor?

446
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:09,036
No woman would reject
that heart of yours, Dad.

447
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:10,829
Oh, sweetie.

448
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,373
Well, the diagnosis is clear.

449
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,916
- I'm going to bed.
- Okay.

450
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:18,962
Look, you're gonna be
a great physician, you know.

451
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,888
I think I've fallen in love.

452
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,603
Odete, I don't know
what to do with Ivana. I really don't.

453
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,021
I told her not to divorce.

454
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,191
I said, "Ivana, changing husbands
is just changing problems."

455
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,942
Did she hear? No, of course not.

456
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,487
Because she never does.
Isn't that right, Adolfo?

457
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,655
- Actually...
- She's going to the ceremony alone!

458
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:47,741
- Can you believe it?
- I'm here.

459
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:48,950
Hi, Mom.

460
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,452
- Hi, Odete. How are you?
- Hi.

461
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,370
Hi, Dad.

462
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,830
- Is this the dress here? I'll try it on.
- Yes.

463
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,501
Look at her, all sad and lonely.

464
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,711
This whole situation is too hard for her.

465
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,879
Don't you think so, Adolfo?

466
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:02,422
- Ow!
- I'm sorry.

467
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,548
"Ow."

468
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,384
Ivana, are you okay?

469
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,511
I'm excellent!

470
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,428
And?

471
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,306
What do you think? Do I look good? Mm?

472
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,102
I love it, Odete. It's beautiful.

473
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,478
Yes...

474
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,689
Well, it's fitted well,
but it's a little too plain.

475
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,776
Yeah, it's plain,
but it's still not done yet, right?

476
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,446
Maybe take out the sleeves.
Show a little more of your arms.

477
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,949
Yeah, take the sleeves out. That's fine.

478
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,951
MORNING, HOME!
I'LL COME BY AT 8 P.M.

479
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,746
Maybe some embroidery
in the neckline to make it stand out.

480
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,999
Embroidery? Sure, Mom. I love embroidery.

481
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,043
Let's put some embroidery right here.

482
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,630
And make the hemline shorter
because you're always stumbling around...

483
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,299
Yeah. Maybe hem it
to show my heels a little.

484
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,968
It's in style. Yeah, do that.

485
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:51,763
Maybe throw a few sparkles in there
to make you glitter a little, yeah?

486
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,598
Oh, sparkles?

487
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,768
Yeah, great idea. You're gonna make me
outshine the newlyweds.

488
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,729
Ivana, what the hell is wrong with you?

489
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,274
What's wrong? What did I do?

490
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,443
Are you actually agreeing with me?

491
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,320
Yeah, I believe that I am.

492
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,407
Why would you do that?
That's completely out of character.

493
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,242
Yeah, because I think you're right.

494
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,619
I'm right? Since when?
You never think I'm right!

495
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,621
Ivana, what's going on with you?

496
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,039
Are you taking drugs now?

497
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,709
Have you been drinking? Let me smell you.

498
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,128
Cut it out! Hey, Dad,
can you please say something?

499
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,046
- I think...
- Did you join a cult?

500
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,341
Were you abducted by cult weirdos?
God, bring my daughter back!

501
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,509
Stop it, Mom!

502
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,095
See, it's like impossible
to please you, huh?

503
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,681
That's precisely
what you're doing right now.

504
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,224
So, why are you screaming?

505
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,601
I don't know!

506
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,770
Habit.

507
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,107
My goodness. Well, I gotta go.

508
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,610
You can do whatever she wants to do.
I trust you.

509
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,695
But don't pinch the waistline too much.

510
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,280
Bye!

511
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,741
I'll buy you
a pair of shoes for next time.

512
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,368
Don't forget about bunch... the bush...

513
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,621
- Brunch.
- I can buy the shoes for this.

514
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,623
And it's "brunch." Mwah!

515
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,293
Mom!

516
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:08,298
- She is not herself.
- Well, that's not the case...

517
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,381
Pfft!

518
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,392
Are you riding a horse?

519
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,609
Wrong movie, Dad.

520
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,737
Are you kidding me?

521
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,615
Oh, dear God!

522
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,161
Nice one.

523
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,413
- Huh? Like it?
- Nailed it, Dad.

524
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,457
Don't you think I look a little taller?

525
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,251
- Huge.
- No, I'm being serious.

526
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,334
Honey, I think...

527
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,088
that these shoes are
giving me one more inch in height.

528
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,171
Look here.

529
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,508
Don't I look a little taller?

530
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,426
Dad, you're still cute anyway.

531
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,929
Don't wanna be cute. I'm a... Lion.

532
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,390
Hey, about that,
I need to tell you something.

533
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,433
Did you get your exam scores yet?

534
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,726
No, not yet.

535
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,771
Okay, but listen, it doesn't matter
what college you go to.

536
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:08,066
The college doesn't make the doctor.
It's the other way around.

537
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,152
- Dad, that's not it.
- I'm nervous, sweetie. I'm just nervous.

538
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,614
Oh, I brought you
a few flavored condoms, okay?

539
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,324
This one is extra thin.

540
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,119
This one here is citrus flavored.

541
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,371
We have a <i>catuaba </i>one too. Super cool.

542
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,832
This one is barbecue.

543
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,293
- Very good.
- I'm never eating barbecue again.

544
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,211
This is the lightsaber one.

545
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,797
I dated this geek once,
and he was really into it.

546
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,133
Ah! I want... La, la, la...

547
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,137
That is TMI.
Daddy doesn't want to hear that.

548
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,806
- Thank you.
- I don't want to share my inheritance.

549
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,517
You done? All right, I gotta get going.

550
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,436
I'd like a baby brother though.

551
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,687
What? No way.

552
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,607
This girl...

553
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,318
I definitely look taller. I really do.

554
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,822
I'll go with lightsaber and barbecue.

555
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,168
- Hey!
- You're late, but what's new?

556
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,003
Such a pain. God...

557
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,671
- Here. Take this first.
- Okay.

558
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,757
Hey, he loves his new bone here.

559
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,091
Frederico is here.

560
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,385
This here is his favorite, but remember,

561
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,721
it's just two drops in the mornings, okay?

562
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,514
Gotta go. Bye, my baby.

563
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:25,310
- Aren't you inviting me inside?
- Never.

564
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,103
Bye, baby, you're gonna be fine.

565
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:30,565
It's only gonna be for a couple of days.
My beautiful baby.

566
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:35,070
He's acting a little weird, isn't he?
Have you been badmouthing me?

567
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,781
That is parental alienation, you know.

568
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,283
Don't be ridiculous. Okay, now go!

569
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,911
Fine. You look nice.

570
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:43,828
You going out?

571
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,414
None of your goddamn business.
Get out of here!

572
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,416
- Get out of here. Go!
- Come on, kiddo.

573
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,710
Where are you going? Take the staircase.

574
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,587
You know Dino gets claustrophobic.

575
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,839
Honey, that's eight flights of stairs.

576
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,257
I couldn't care less.

577
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,801
Go take the stairs!

578
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,636
- Come on, buddy.
- For Christ's sake.

579
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,887
I'm so sick of you.

580
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,097
Slowly.

581
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,807
Dino, don't run! Wait!

582
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,351
Wait for Daddy! No! Oh, Dino!

583
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,405
Good evening, Mr. Lourival.

584
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,614
Hm...

585
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,949
- Hi.
- Hi.

586
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,491
You look beautiful.

587
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,412
Well?

588
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,955
Shh! Get back, get back.

589
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,878
What the hell was that?

590
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:49,893
Leão?

591
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:54,899
Password.

592
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,067
Password?

593
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,288
Okay.

594
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,416
All right.
Not even my phone has a password.

595
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,567
Wow!

596
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:46,534
Oh, my goodness. This is incredible!

597
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,828
- Do you come here often?
- Not really.

598
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,247
Mr. Leão! What an honor.

599
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,792
I just have one of those faces.

600
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,170
- Aren't you playing tonight?
- No.

601
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,338
You can play?

602
00:29:58,421 --> 00:30:01,049
Not so much. It's really just for fun.

603
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,760
I'm not playing tonight,
I'm accompanying this lady here tonight.

604
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,762
It'd be highly rude of me
to leave her alone.

605
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,845
No, don't be silly.

606
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,640
No, I'd love to see you play.

607
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,892
Do it. Just one, just one for me.

608
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,853
- I'll play a special one for you.
- Yeah.

609
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,063

Just a sec, cutie.

00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,749
I don't know.
Let me tell you something, shorty.

00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,168

like you bravely suggested,

00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,615
And the joke about the Pope,
a parrot and an airplane?

699
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,117
I won't make you hear it now.

700
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,373
You're clueless, right?
That's how I feel during mass.

701
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,543
Just kidding. What I really wanted to say
is that I'm quite certain

702
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,129
that the Pope's heart is Brazilian.

703
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,756
SACRED HEART HOSPITAL

704
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,393
I actually have a gift here for you.

705
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,436
- Oh, dear. Please.
- Wonderful.

706
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,901
Wow, that's quite a gift.

707
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,487
Let me see. Huh!

708
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,698
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh!

709
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:14,328
Oh, your Highness, let me just tell you
something in confidence here.

710
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,455
Pelé was better than Maradona, right?

711
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,791
No. Oh, no.

712
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,585
Hm, I'm a fan of Pelé

713
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,296
since I was a kid, but don't tell anyone.

714
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,924
Shh, let's call it
doctor-patient confidentiality.

715
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,568
But I already knew it.

716
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,970
- Oops, I think my phone is ringing.
- Of course.

717
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,596
Um, it's important, I have to...

718
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,557
Hello, Home?

719
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,976
Am I interrupting something important?
Are you busy?

720
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,769
No, I'm not doing anything important.

721
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,396
<i>- You slept well?</i>
- Very well.

722
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,774
<i>Listen, would you like
to come have lunch at my place?</i>

723
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,067
How about tomorrow?

724
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,068
<i>It's a deal.</i>

725
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,528
- I'll cook.
<i>- Great!</i>

726
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,611
See you then.

727
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,781
Kiss, kiss. Bye.

728
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:55,661
Well, I gotta run, Mr. Pope.
There are big things happening,

729
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,037
so try to remember,

730
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:01,375
no Feast of St. John, no Easter Vigil,
none of that kind of thing.

731
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,627
And take care of that heart, okay?

732
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,671
One more thing I wanted to ask you.

733
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,840
I'm not sure it's appropriate... One sec.

734
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,216
It's something personal.

735
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,886
<i>Mi hija...</i> No. <i>Mi hija...</i>

736
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,096
<i>- La niña...
- La niña.</i>

737
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,514
<i>- Tu niña.</i>
- But...

738
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,141
Not Nina, her name is Manu.

739
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:19,310
- Huh.
- She just took her exams.

740
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,729
- She wants to be a doctor.
- Entrance exams?

741
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,772
Yes, her exams for med school.

742
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,400
Since you happen to have
an open line with the Almighty,

743
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,445
maybe you could talk to him
'cause she really deserves it.

744
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:31,322
Leave it to me.

745
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,866
I'll take care of it.

746
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,122
Good morning!

747
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,583
- Good morning, Corina.
- Hello!

748
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,794
Oh, look, Miss Snow White is finally here!

749
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,631
For you, Snow White.

750
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,050
What is it?

751
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,135
Isn't she the one that likes the dwarfs?

752
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,597
Which one are you dating? Sneezy?

753
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,140
Or maybe Grumpy.

754
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,309
I know, it's Dopey. Right?

755
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,686
What are you saying, Danilo?

756
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,064
I saw you two last night leaving.

757
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:08,734
I barely saw him.
I didn't have a magnifying glass.

758
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,069
That's my business.

759
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,864
Tell me.
Why are you doing this, Ivana?

760
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,700
Are you trying to humiliate me,
is that it?

761
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:20,079
What are people gonna say
when they see you with this gnome, huh?

762
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,666
Are you gonna go around
calling this midget your lover?

763
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:27,169
Will you introduce him to your family?
Or to all your friends?

764
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,587
And your mom!

765
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:32,841
What's she gonna think when she sees you
with this little ankle biter?

766
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:33,759
Huh?

767
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,219
Aren't you a little embarrassed?

768
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,428
Listen to me, Danilo...

769
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,764
No, I won't.
I'm running late for a meeting.

770
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:40,307
And here you go.

771
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,768
Say hello to your Lilliputian friend.

772
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,318
I'll tell you
where you can shove this apple.

773
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,950
Why didn't you tell me
you had a new fling? Oh, wow!

774
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:01,704
It all happened so suddenly,
I just didn't have the time.

775
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:05,165
But Danilo is overreacting, right?
About the... the...

776
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,544
No, well, he is short though.

777
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:12,172
He... he's short. He's small in height,

778
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,591
but he's a big person.

779
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,467
Of course, my dear.

780
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,386
When I'm with him,

781
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,180
I don't even think
about his height, you know?

782
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,266
Of course, yeah, sure.

783
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,393
And you two have...

784
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,397
- Well, yeah.
- Was it good?

785
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,149
It was so wow!

786
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,818
That's good!

787
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,946
So, it's true that... Excuse my curiosity...

788
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,575
- Is it?
- It is for sure.

789
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,579
Wow, what a lucky girl you are!

790
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,040
I really admire you, you know.

791
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,168
You just ended
the most catastrophic marriage

792
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,795
and quickly began
a crazy, whirlwind love affair.

793
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,964
That's such a rare thing. I mean...

794
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,924
Don't mind what Danilo says.

795
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:59,011
So what if the guy is
super ultra teeny tiny?

796
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,472
So what if everybody's gonna stare at you?

797
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:04,016
So what if everyone's gonna mock you?

798
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,060
So what if your mom's gonna freak out?

799
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,104
What really matters is
you like each other, right?

800
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,255

DANILO CELL

813
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:14,313
<i>Ivana, answer me.
I need to talk to you.</i>

814
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,440
<i>I want to change our arrangement.</i>

815
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:19,401
<i>No one showed up
to share the office, so keep it.</i>

816
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:23,363
<i>I'm actually struggling financially
and I can't afford it.</i>

817
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,239
Danilo...

818
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:33,957
Danilo. Listen to me carefully.
I'm not gonna fall for this again.

819
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,169
I told you already that I don't want it.

820
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,712
Maybe it'll work for a while,

821
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,089
but I've much bigger plans for myself.

822
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,258
You know that it's just too small for me.

823
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,135
Goodbye, dear.

824
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,890
Shit!

825
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,141
Oh, God!

826
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,644
Damn it! Damn it!

827
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,156
<i>He goes for the long pass.</i>

828
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,784
<i>The linesman flags the offside.</i>

829
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,036
Hey. Psst!

830
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,247
Sir?

831
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:15,957
Hey.

832
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,167
Down here, sir.

833
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,546
Sir, please!

834
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,173
Pizza delivery.

835
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,508
God, seriously?

836
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,426
- Pizza delivery.
- Where?

837
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,510
Pizza.

838
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,866
Sorry, man. Need a hand, shorty?

839
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,450
I don't need a hand, fatty.

840
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:51,952
My bad, bro.

841
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:53,953
Excuse me.

842
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,529
Hi, Leão!

843
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,196
Come in.

844
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,074
Home?

845
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:34,578
I'm home, Home.

846
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,788
Just a minute!

847
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,290
I'm still getting dressed.

848
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,296
Sh...

849
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,551
Calm down, dinosaur.

850
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,767
No, no, no!

851
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,021
Have you met Dino?

852
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,108
Leão, is everything okay?

853
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,821
Oh, that's a new hairstyle!

854
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:14,451
Yeah, I figured the Italian look
would match the menu for today.

855
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,869
Right, Dino?

856
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,996
Make yourself at home.

857
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,123
- Do you mind starting without me?
- No.

858
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,750
I'm feeling right at home.

859
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,252
Be right back. I'll be done in a minute.

860
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,926
Well, that's high up even for her.

861
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:35,596
Hm...

862
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:47,401
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I think I'm up to the task.

863
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,011
Leão, you okay? Want some help?

864
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,096
No, everything's going fine in here.

865
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,266
Okay. I'm almost ready. Be right there.

866
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:02,349
Okay.

867
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,900
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I take long?

868
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,277
- You're right on time.
- It smells great!

869
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:13,945
May I serve you?

870
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,029
Sure thing.

871
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,535
<i>- Voilà.</i>
- Leão!

872
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,329
God, this is just marvelous!

873
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,539
Eat it first, praise me after.

874
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:25,623
Yeah, got it.

875
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,959
Mm!

876
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,043
Oh, God.

877
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,131
Mm!

878
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,217
Hi, Mom!

879
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,468
No.

880
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:41,515
No, I haven't seen any messages.
My phone was drying in some rice.

881
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,726
I dropped it in Dino's water bowl.

882
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,728
Nothing much. Go ahead.

883
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,439
No, don't come over now.

884
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,650
What do you need to come for?

885
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,820
I have a... a guest over here.

886
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,404
Yeah.

887
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,408
No, you don't know him.
You haven't met him.

888
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,369
Yeah.

889
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,497
I know the party is on Saturday.

890
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,165
Don't worry, I'm gonna go alone.

891
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,458
Okay.

892
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,381
Okay, Mom, can we talk about this later?
I'm busy. I'll call you back.

893
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,509
Mom, love you. Love you, bye. Goodbye!

894
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,592
God.

895
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,596
She's so anxious
about this party on Saturday.

896
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,931
On Saturday?

897
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,227
- So, you aren't having wine?
- No, I'm a lightweight.

898
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:29,436
Mm!

899
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,316
It's my brother's party.
Didn't I mention it?

900
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,568
No, you didn't.

901
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,237
Well, my brother's getting married.

902
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,907
My mom is throwing this little party
to introduce the two families.

903
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:44,452
It's not a... It's a small reception.
An intimate thing.

904
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,496
An intimate thing? Oh, wow.

905
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,208
Would you...

906
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,005
Would you like to go with me?

907
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,382
I don't know. Do you want me to?

908
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,759
Yeah, if that's what you want.

909
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,637
You really don't need
to invite me just to be polite.

910
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,973
No, I'd never do something like that.

911
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,224
Then I'll go.

912
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,602
Only if you want to, yeah?

913
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:09,895
Yeah, sure, I'll go.

914
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,272
So, if you don't wanna go, it's okay.

915
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,859
But if you do wanna go,
I'd like for you to go.

916
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:16,776
I'll go.

917
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,777
Mm!

918
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,904
Mm, okay.

919
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,991
Tell me something.

920
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,826
I'll go...

921
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,996
as what? What would you call me?

922
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,749
It's intimate, right? So, I'll go as what?

923
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,751
No, it's...

924
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:34,920
It's not a... You know, nothing fancy.

925
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:38,381
It's like a pool party, brunch, barbecue.
It's my brother's thing.

926
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,799
Like a cookout, you know?

927
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,552
You can just dress casually.

928
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,609
Hello. Is this the address
for Vladimir's party?

929
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,277
Honey, you're terribly late!

930
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,007
Wow, cool, Mom. This is all so beautiful!

931
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,509
Don't you know your brother?

932
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,427
Yeah, he loves this!

933
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,346
It's just so beautiful.

934
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,014
Ivana, what about that guest of yours?

935
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,892
I guess he's running late then.

936
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,698
My God!

937
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,867
It's a dwarf!

938
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,663
Oh, I adore dwarfs!

939
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,416
He's just such a cutie!

940
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:03,091
Where did they find this cute
little dancing dwarf guy?

941
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,926
Hello, midget!

942
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,533
He's so cute!

943
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,787
I think I got lost. Am I on time?

944
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,173
Hi, hello, everyone.

945
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,841
- How are you?
- Hi.

946
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,513
Ivana, is this man your guest?

947
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:52,140
Where did you two meet?

948
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,518
He is. He's the one
who found my phone, Mom.

949
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,729
- Ah!
- I found her cell phone.

950
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,649
He is...

951
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,360
He is Ricardo.

952
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:04,527
Ricardo Leão.

953
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,322
This is my dad, Adolfo. This is my mom.

954
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:09,532
I'm Márcia, the groom's mother.

955
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:12,577
Hi, I'm Vladimir. I'm Ivana's brother.

956
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:15,372
And this is Jeff, my soon-to-be husband.

957
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,582
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

958
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,543
These are his parents, Jacob and Sharon.

959
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,754
They're doctors in Alabama.

960
00:56:22,837 --> 00:56:24,714
- Nice to meet you too.
- Hi.

961
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,383
I think I know you.

962
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,552
I think we know him, don't we, Jacob?

963
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,179
Of course, my baby.

964
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:36,142
You are the cardiologist.
We know all about your work.

965
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,977
- Oh!
- Cardio...

966
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,813
What are they talking about guys?

967
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:42,232
Leão is a cardiologist, Mom.

968
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,984
He's one of the best in the country.

969
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,028
One of the best in Brazil.

970
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,407
No, he's one of the best in the world.

971
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,201
What did she say?

972
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,620
She said that he's
one of the best in the world.

973
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,789
I'm not so sure about
the best in the world,

974
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,958
but I'm definitely the smallest one.

975
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,091
Got a good laugh, huh?

976
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,432
Is he your boyfriend, Ivana?

977
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,060
What did he say?

978
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,146
What did he say, Ivana?

979
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,982
No, we're just friends.

980
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,695
Just friends?
A friend! A friend! Just a friend.

981
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,530
Of course, friend.

982
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,199
A friend of hers.

983
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,327
Hey, Ivana,
why don't you get a drink for Leão?

984
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:39,330
- Is he allowed to drink?
- Yes, I can.

985
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,416
But not today, because I'm driving.

986
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:44,294
- You know how to drive?
- No, just my plastic trike.

987
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,547
Oh, that's why you were late, huh?

988
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:50,633
- It's pretty good exercise.
- I'll go get you a drink.

989
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,266
Which one is without alcohol?

990
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:02,020
Oh, I'm just so taken with you,
Little Lion.

991
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,314
Yeah, likewise, Little Tiger.

992
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:12,947
Oh, I'm just so happy
that Ivana has found a new little buddy.

993
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:18,870
You could help me out. I'm convincing her
to get back with Danilo.

994
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:20,955
They love each other so much.

995
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,167
Can you believe they got married
after dating for only a month?

996
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,793
Just like me and Adolfo.

997
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,003
They're soul mates.

998
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:30,507
She doesn't even notice it,
but she's always talking about that guy,

999
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,218
which must mean
she is still in love with him, right?

1000
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,471
- Right, sure, sure. Yes.
- Hey!

1001
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,097
- Leão?
- Hey.

1002
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,350
What do they call you in English?

1003
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:42,602
"Anal."

1004
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,605
Your drink.

1005
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,274
Thank you.

1006
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,743
Dad, I have to talk to you.

1007
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,329
The article is great,
but they missed my height again.

1008
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:02,455
- Oh.
- What's up?

1009
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,457
- I did it. Uh-huh!
- You did it?

1010
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,127
And this is how you tell me, honey?
Get over here!

1011
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,630
Hey! I'm so happy!

1012
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,674
- I was so sure you'd get it.
- Yeah, but...

1013
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:13,967
I'm so proud of you.

1014
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,760
I always knew you'd get it.

1015
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:18,763
But now I'm so proud.
You did it, like a boss.

1016
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:21,057
- I'm so happy for you!
- So, about that, I...

1017
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,351
I don't want to steer you
in any direction,

1018
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:25,395
but you'd make a great cardiologist.

1019
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,021
Just saying, huh?

1020
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,607
- Uh, yeah, so I have...
- Just a sec.

1021
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,691
Hello?

1022
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,235
- Dad?
- Pope? Pope?

1023
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:34,904
I'm talking to the Pope.
I think I should thank him.

1024
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,364
Pope! <i>Soy yo</i>.

1025
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,243
Leão, the one who did the operation.

1026
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:44,539
Listen, Pope, is everything all right?
Are they treating you well?

1027
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:48,835
I'm just calling to say thank you
because my daughter passed her exam.

1028
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,045
Oh! <i>Je suis trés feliz.</i>

1029
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,549
God, Mom,
why did you pick this route?

1030
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,510
We're gonna end up being late.
I'm telling you.

1031
00:59:58,094 --> 01:00:00,054
Here you go. Follow the GPS.

1032
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,390
<i>In a quarter mile, keep left.</i>

1033
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,017
What is that voicethere?

1034
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,643
<i>At the roundabout, turn right.</i>

1035
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,313
Well, the GPS is suggesting
the very worst route.

1036
01:00:08,396 --> 01:00:12,400
This wedding dessert had better be
the most delicious dessert in the world.

1037
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,776
For Christ's sake.

1038
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,737
Ah, you know, speaking of which,

1039
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,781
have you decided
who's going with you to the ceremony?

1040
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,367
I haven't decided yet. I'm still thinking.

1041
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,161
Are you seeing someone

1042
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,663
and didn't bother to tell me about it
by any chance?

1043
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,416
I wanna know who it is. Do I know him?

1044
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,460
Well, yes.

1045
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,545
Mm, well, who is he?

1046
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,671
It's Ricardo.

1047
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,302
Ricardo? Who's this Ricardo?

1048
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:44,015
It's Ricardo Leão,
you met him at the brunch.

1049
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:46,309
Well, I met a lot of people at the party.

1050
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:47,518
Leão the cardiologist.

1051
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,604
Oh, the cardio...

1052
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,730
Huh?

1053
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,983
Oh, no!

1054
01:00:54,067 --> 01:00:55,067
Mom!

1055
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,694
- For God's sake!
- For my sake!

1056
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:57,904
What are you thinking?

1057
01:00:57,987 --> 01:00:59,947
Are you trying to kill me
with disappointment?

1058
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,391
You're the one who's gonna kill us
by driving like a psycho!

1059
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:03,493
Oh, Ivana.

1060
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:07,205
There are a lot of normal guys out there.
Do you really have to date a...

1061
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,288
a <i>him</i>?

1062
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,207
Normal?

1063
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,084
Normal?

1064
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,296
Stop being so goddamn prejudiced.

1065
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:17,590
Me? How am I prejudiced?

1066
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,259
You're being prejudiced!

1067
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:22,261
I'm an extremely open-minded woman.

1068
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,345
I'm modern.

1069
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,556
Your brother is gay and I accept it.

1070
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,684
His boyfriend is a foreigner
and I accept it.

1071
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,268
Your dad is a vegan and I accept it.

1072
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,188
Tell me then, how am I "prejudiced"?

1073
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,234
Do you even hear yourself when you talk?

1074
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,444
What are you...

1075
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,278
That's it.

1076
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,823
I've had enough of this.

1077
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,866
- Ivana.
- Screw the stupid dessert!

1078
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:46,828
Ivana, come back here!
I'm talking to you for God's sake!

1079
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:48,955
- Ivana!
<i>- Careful. Inappropriate move.</i>

1080
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,749
You forgot your phone. Come back here!

1081
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,669
- Morning, Corina.
- Good morning.

1082
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,378
Is Danilo here?

1083
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,131
Ivana?

1084
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,924
Is... is that Ivana, Corina?

1085
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:01,758
Hey, Iva...

1086
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:05,847
Or is that Madonna
here to adopt another child?

1087
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,143
Yeah, I'm Madonna. I'm Madonna.

1088
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:13,229
Cut it out. Listen,
I'm not in the mood for your nonsense.

1089
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:15,189
Sure, I'll tone it down.

1090
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,900
<i>♪ Oh, the very first time ♪</i>

1091
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:21,112
So then, Madonna,
are you keeping the office then?

1092
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,322
Are you deaf or what?

1093
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,700
Didn't you hear me saying that
I don't want the office?

1094
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,452
It's too damn little.

1095
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,746
It reminds me of you, it's suffocating.

1096
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,081
Oh, so big men tend to suffocate you, huh?

1097
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,003
I'm done. I'm done.
I'd rather just work from home, Corina.

1098
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,086
Just so you know,

1099
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,923
Leão is a much bigger man
than you'll ever be.

1100
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:42,842
In every way.

1101
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,430
In every...

1102
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:48,890
What do you mean bigger?

1103
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:49,973
Hey, listen to me.

1104
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,184
Pew!

1105
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:56,314
What... What are you trying to say?

1106
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:59,150
- A small pond can hold enormous fish.
- Go to hell!

1107
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,902
I... I don't remember exactly...

1108
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:03,780
Talk to the hand 'cause I'm not listening!

1109
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:12,079
Excuse me...

1110
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,919
Hello. Is this the law office
of Miss Ivana?

1111
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,128
Hi!

1112
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,214
You must be the famous Leão.

1113
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,840
I was dying to meet you.

1114
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:25,051
I imagined you'd be a lot shorter.

1115
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:29,096
Maybe it's your glasses.

1116
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:31,641
How sweet.

1117
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,272
- Hey. And Miss Ivana?
- Hi.

1118
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,316
Uh, she just walked out.

1119
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,735
I'll call her
and let her know you're here.

1120
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:43,820
One moment, please.

1121
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:49,574
Oh!

1122
01:03:50,117 --> 01:03:52,787
- No need for that.
- Excuse me.

1123
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,496
Fine.

1124
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:05,007
Make yourself at home.

1125
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:10,346
<i>The person
you have reached is unavailable.</i>

1126
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:12,265
I'm getting her voicemail.

1127
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,934
- She's not great with phones, huh?
- Shocker.

1128
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:20,189
Did you have a date or were you here for...

1129
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:24,026
No. My daughter got
the results of her exams

1130
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,237
and I'd like to invite Ivana
to our celebration.

1131
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,240
Ivana has lost it!

1132
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:30,950
She's completely crazy!

1133
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:34,161
I'm certain that mini-man has
burrowed his way into her head.

1134
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,621
What the hell?

1135
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,499
She must be so dumb
to fall for just anybody.

1136
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:42,211
She must be so incredibly desperate
to stoop that low.

1137
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:48,009
If I ever run into that tiny nightmare,
I swear to God, I'll...

1138
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,093
Do what?

1139
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,176
Oh!

1140
01:04:50,219 --> 01:04:53,764
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you had half of a guest here.

1141
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:56,392
Danilo, this is Leão.
Your wife's boyfriend.

1142
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,978
Leão this is Danilo.
Your girlfriend's husband.

1143
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,187
Uh, I mean...

1144
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,191
Let me see if I can catch her.
Excuse me for a sec.

1145
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,571
- You were saying what?
- Well...

1146
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:13,200
I was just saying that Ivana is
far out of your league, little guy.

1147
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:14,285
Look at you.

1148
01:05:14,368 --> 01:05:16,996
If you can even reach
a mirror, that is...

1149
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,838
Whoa!

1150
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,784
Dear God! What on earth is going on?

1151
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,535
Shame on you, Leão!

1152
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,722
why don't you pick a fight
with someone your own size!

1153
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,289
I'm not done yet, you bastard.

1154
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,458
Ivana has been lying to you.

1155
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:04,502
And they say lies have short legs.

1156
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:06,253
Listen to this.

1157
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:10,549
<i>Danilo. Listen to me carefully.
I'm not gonna fall for this again.</i>

1158
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,761
<i>I told you already that I don't want it.</i>

1159
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:15,304
<i>Maybe it'll work for a while,</i>

1160
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,682
<i>but I've much bigger plans for myself.</i>

1161
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:20,434
<i>- It's just too small for me.</i>
- You're done, Playmobil.

1162
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:24,230
Poor thing, it must be
hard enough to be born like that.

1163
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:32,571
Whoa!

1164
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:34,907
Hey, shorty, it's you again.

1165
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,575
My bad. Need a hand?

1166
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:39,453
I don't need a hand, you fatty!

1167
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:42,081
A man of your size
should be more careful, okay?

1168
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:43,749
Sorry, dude, didn't see you.

1169
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,836
That's the thing.
People never see me. No one ever sees me.

1170
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:48,754
I'm just fine on my own.

1171
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,464
Fine on my own as always.

1172
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,972
Cláudia, you know Dad,
he doesn't listen to me.

1173
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:00,349
Oh, my darling, he's gonna listen to you.

1174
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,476
- You're so happy now.
- Yeah, that's true.

1175
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,981
Oh, well, look who's here. Your dad.

1176
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:13,779
Leão, what happened?

1177
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,616
No, this is nothing. It's not important.

1178
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,995
My future physician is the most important,
and we must celebrate.

1179
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:24,123
So, Dad, listen.
I need to talk to you about something.

1180
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:25,206
Sure, sweetie.

1181
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:29,295
It's just I'm not going to the college
you expected me too.

1182
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,630
You scared me. Who cares?

1183
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:33,466
You ought to know by now.

1184
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,594
- The calling matters more than the school.
- Veterinary school.

1185
01:07:36,677 --> 01:07:38,054
Veterinary... What?

1186
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,513
A veterinarian.

1187
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,807
That's always been my dream job.

1188
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,810
- I really love animals.
- You'll treat animals?

1189
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:45,978
Animals are like people.

1190
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,230
Just give us a second here.

1191
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,276
Why did you lie to me?

1192
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,570
I didn't lie, Dad, I just didn't tell you.

1193
01:07:54,653 --> 01:07:58,032
You know how I hate being lied to, Manu.
I detest it!

1194
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:00,993
First, it's Ivana who betrays me,
now you, of all people?

1195
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,357
You aren't listening to me, Dad.

1196
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,914
And you listen to animals, right?
That's why you'll treat them?

1197
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:06,916
Because you know how to listen?

1198
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:07,999
Hello!

1199
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:11,087
Here's some chocolates
for the future cardiologist.

1200
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:13,296
Come with me.

1201
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:19,970
It has a cherry filling.

1202
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,056
What's wrong?

1203
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,519
Corina told me
that you came by the office.

1204
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:30,731
Well, uh, this isn't working out, okay?

1205
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,359
What? What's that?

1206
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:36,611
Us.

1207
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:39,490
We'd better stop things here.

1208
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,369
What do you mean, Leão?

1209
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,621
I don't understand what you're saying.

1210
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:52,503
I wouldn't want to get in the way
of your bigger plans.

1211
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:56,465
Are you...

1212
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:00,094
Are you breaking up with me, Leão?

1213
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:05,432
I don't want to be with someone
who's ashamed of me, Ivana.

1214
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,103
No, that's not true.

1215
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:11,438
Listen, I...

1216
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:14,608
This is complicated for me, you know.

1217
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,359
I...

1218
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:20,281
I don't always know how to behave.
I'm still learning.

1219
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:21,991
I'm not perfect, I...

1220
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:25,661
You might think I am, but I'm just not.

1221
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:27,580
- I also have my flaws.
- You...

1222
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:32,042
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'd like for you to leave.

1223
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:36,463
You want me to leave?

1224
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,342
It's my daughter's party.

1225
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:42,970
So could you please go?

1243
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:27,092
THE FAMILY OF THE GROOM
INVITES MR. LEÃO

1244
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:29,553
TO THE WEDDING CEREMONY
OF VLAD AND JEFF

1245
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:38,103
<i>♪ Happiness can only be found ♪</i>

1246
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:44,401
<i>♪ When you surrender your heart ♪</i>

1247
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,617
Dad, look what I found in the fireplace.

1248
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:54,161
You should've left it alone.

1249
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,455
I can't believe you're not going.

1250
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,791
Didn't you hear what Ivana said?

1251
01:12:58,874 --> 01:13:00,959
Did you? You usually hear what you want.

1252
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:03,962
Why don't you give her a chance?
Stop being so proud.

1253
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:06,673
- I'm not proud.
- Yeah, right.

1254
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:09,593
I'm very proud of my lack of pride, okay?

1255
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:12,012
Who are you to talk to me like that?

1256
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:13,847
You've been lying to me forever.

1257
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:15,808
You wouldn't have listened anyway.

1258
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:19,895
I was always being honest with myself.
You're the one who's lying.

1259
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:21,939
Listen...

1260
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:25,359
You always told me
your height wasn't a problem for you.

1261
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:26,610
I always believed you.

1262
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:29,863
But you were lying to me.
Just look at you now.

1263
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:32,574
Of course it's a problem.

1264
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:37,329
Do you think it was easy
to see everyone around me growing up

1265
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:39,288
and not me?

1266
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:45,796
I always had to work at least
ten times harder than everyone else.

1267
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:50,634
And what was it for? Nothing.

1268
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:54,596
I'm always gonna be the dwarf.

1269
01:13:57,558 --> 01:14:00,894
Then stop being vain pretending like
it isn't a problem for you.

1270
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,188
Do you think it's easy for Ivana?

1271
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:07,025
If you want her to accept you,
accept yourself first.

1272
01:14:08,026 --> 01:14:09,153
Look, Dad,

1273
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:12,156
even if you were one or two feet taller,

1274
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:14,741
it wouldn't change anything
about who you are.

1275
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:22,291
Manu, wait.

1276
01:14:27,921 --> 01:14:29,882
You're going to be a great veterinarian.

1277
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:42,019
You already know
how to take care of lions!

1278
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,145
Mm-hm.

1279
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,570
Groom's guests, this way.
You two, over here.

1280
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,322
The other groom, that way.

1281
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:55,491
You can be here now.

1282
01:14:57,451 --> 01:14:59,203
My God, my God!

1283
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:01,204
Damn!

1284
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,166
Guys, where's the justice?

1285
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:11,215
Oh!

1286
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,967
Oh, goddammit.

1287
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:21,349
Uh...

1288
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,268
- Danilo.
- Hi.

1289
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,730
Who invited you, Danilo?

1290
01:15:26,813 --> 01:15:29,691
Uh, your mom practically told me to come.

1291
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:32,027
Wow, you, uh...

1292
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:33,612
You're beautiful.

1293
01:15:35,739 --> 01:15:40,244
You know, Ivana, us getting a divorce was
a terrible decision. You know that?

1294
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,914
The clients love you, Corina loves you.

1295
01:15:43,997 --> 01:15:45,832
Dino loves you, I...

1296
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,252
I'm bankrupt now. I...

1297
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:52,548
Wouldn't it be better financially
if we stuck together?

1298
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:55,801
So, just think that over.

1299
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:59,346
I'll get you some white wine. I got you!

1300
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,185
I hate white wine.

1301
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:07,479
He's the groom's guest, right?

1302
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,236
Come here, doggy.

1303
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,489
I don't get paid enough for this.

1304
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:19,283
Keep going, hun. I know you can do it.

1305
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:21,033
Mom!

1306
01:16:21,451 --> 01:16:23,870
Justice of the Peace,
take this dog and go to your mark.

1307
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:26,248
It's about to start.
I hate dogs, I hate weddings.

1308
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:28,375
What the hell am I even doing here?

1309
01:16:28,959 --> 01:16:29,793
Hi, guys.

1310
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:32,254
Mom, why on earth did you invite Danilo?

1311
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:35,340
Well, when I heard those things
you said about Leão,

1312
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,508
I simply thought...

1313
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:37,759
What did I say about Leão?

1314
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,304
I heard everything after that fistfight.

1315
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,848
- You heard...
- Fistfight? What fight?

1316
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,517
The fight at the office.
You didn't tell her about it, Danilo?

1317
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,394
I told your dad, and I told Jeff,

1318
01:16:47,477 --> 01:16:49,396
and I told Vlad, I told Sharon,

1319
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:51,940
and I also told Jacob, I told everyone.

1320
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,609
Wh... What fight? What happened?

1321
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:55,611
Well, it wasn't really a fight.

1322
01:16:55,694 --> 01:16:57,195
No, yeah, he really kicked your ass.

1323
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:59,698
It was kind of biblical,
David versus Goliath.

1324
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:02,492
And the little guy only stopped
when Danilo

1325
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:05,537
finally told him you'd been lying to him.

1326
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,499
Me? You... What the hell did you tell Leão?

1327
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:13,045
It was that voice message
where you said you didn't want him,

1328
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,756
you had bigger plans,
and he was too little for you.

1329
01:17:15,839 --> 01:17:17,674
What an ugly thing to say, Ivana.

1330
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:21,386
My God, I was just talking...
I was talking about the office.

1331
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,014
It wasn't about Leão. You did... You are...

1332
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,059
How can you be such a moron?

1333
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:30,979
You're not just a moron,
you're also a bad person.

1334
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:33,148
Ivana, this is my wedding. What the hell?

1335
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:35,108
Can you please control your behavior?

1336
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:38,070
Hang on, you know how she likes to go low.

1337
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:42,115
What is going on here?

1338
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:44,826
Get out of here. Get him out of here!

1339
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,371
Washing dirty laundry, you know?

1340
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:50,582
Was that really necessary?
Such a pretty nose.

1341
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:53,418
And you need to stop
butting into my personal life.

1342
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,629
- This is your fault! All of this.
- Mine?

1343
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:57,631
I just want
what's best for you, that's all.

1344
01:17:57,714 --> 01:18:00,550
Aren't you able to see that?
Do you see that, Adolfo?

1345
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:02,844
- Well...
- Just listen to your father. Yeah.

1346
01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:04,680
See, Jeff, you'd better get used to it.

1347
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:07,307
You'll soon find out that, Ivana,
she's always arguing with me.

1348
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:08,684
What a family!

1349
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:10,912
Did you hear that?
You need to think about your family.

1350
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:12,938
- Jesus!
- And about Jesus also!

1351
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:15,190
I want what's best for you
because Danilo...

1352
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:16,566
Enough, Márcia!

1353
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,571
Stop it! You're wrong.
You're completely wrong!

1354
01:18:22,322 --> 01:18:25,242
You're absolutely wrong.
You've been talking nonstop for 40 years.

1355
01:18:25,325 --> 01:18:26,952
It's as though you swallowed a radio.

1356
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:29,913
She can choose whomever
she wants to be with.

1357
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:32,624
She doesn't even like Danilo.
Don't you realize that?

1358
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,918
She's in love with the cute little guy.

1359
01:18:36,002 --> 01:18:40,757
My dear, no one else should try
to tell you what true love is.

1360
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:43,802
If you must listen to anyone, or anything,

1361
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,137
listen to your heart.

1362
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,640
Oh, my God!

1363
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,392
- Dad?
- Oh, my God!

1364
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:51,768
Call a doctor!

1365
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:54,187
- Call Dr. Leão!
- Dad, talk to me!

1366
01:18:54,271 --> 01:18:56,857
Another wedding death,
seriously? For real?

1367
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:00,986
- My God.
- I want Dr. Leão!

1368
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:05,574
I'm talking to you! Wake up, girl.
I want Dr. Leão!

1369
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:08,118
Excuse me, Dr. Leão isn't here yet.

1370
01:19:21,214 --> 01:19:24,843
Hi. Excuse me, man.
Is the wedding over?

1371
01:19:25,343 --> 01:19:27,304
The wedding didn't even start.

1372
01:19:27,387 --> 01:19:28,889
The groom's dad fell ill.

1373
01:19:28,972 --> 01:19:31,516
They all went to the hospital.

1374
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,810
To the hospital? But... But which hospital?

1375
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:37,189
The hospital. I don't know,
they went after the Lion King.

1376
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:40,192
- Dr. Lion.
- Yes.

1377
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:41,359
Dr. Leão, that's me.

1378
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:42,903
God!

1379
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:49,742
Ivana?

1380
01:19:50,076 --> 01:19:51,995
She's out, can I help?

1381
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:57,459
Hey, that phone is Ivana's.

1382
01:19:57,542 --> 01:19:59,002
- Give it. Give it, please.
- Sure.

1383
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:01,378
Big guy.

1384
01:20:20,732 --> 01:20:23,568
Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Wow!

1385
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:25,320
Ow!

1386
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:38,083
A fucking garden gnome...

1387
01:20:38,166 --> 01:20:40,710
Delivery for Vladimir and Jeff.
Is this the place?

1388
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:44,005
That's all I need right now.
Are you following me, fatty?

1389
01:20:44,089 --> 01:20:45,632
No, man, I've got things to do.

1390
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:47,634
Hey, so is everything okay, shorty?

1391
01:20:47,717 --> 01:20:48,635
I'm doing just great!

1392
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:51,346
Got a flat tire,
and I have to go to the hospital,

1393
01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:52,764
everything's just dandy!

1394
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:56,685
Could you help me?

1395
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:58,770
Say what?

1396
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:01,565
- Do you think you could help me out?
- Speak louder.

1397
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:03,816
Help me.

1398
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:07,946
I need a hand. Could you please help me?

1399
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:10,615
Oh, you need help!

1400
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:12,284
I thought you'd never ask me.

1401
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,160
Hop on, shorty. I'll take you right there.

1402
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:15,829
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

1403
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:17,830
Hey. Psst!

1404
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:21,793
Now we're a little more familiar,
please stop calling me "shorty."

1405
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:22,711
It's not cool.

1406
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:25,130
Yeah, well, you call me "fatty."
And you're really short.

1407
01:21:25,213 --> 01:21:26,590
We are what we are, bro.

1408
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:29,175
We are what we are.

1409
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:32,804
- Oh, sweetie!
- It's gonna be okay. Easy, slow.

1410
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:33,722
Just breathe.

1411
01:21:33,805 --> 01:21:37,058
- Breathe, darling, don't speak.
- Let him speak. How do you feel, Dad?

1412
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,562
- Don't speak!
- Poor guy.

1413
01:21:40,645 --> 01:21:43,273
- Hey! Get your hands off him!
- God, stop it, Mom!

1414
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:44,733
I need his blood pressure.

1415
01:21:44,816 --> 01:21:47,068
I want Dr. Leão! Get your grubby hands...

1416
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:50,280
- I told you. Dr. Leão isn't here.
- The lion escaped.

1417
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:52,991
Your husband needs care immediately!

1418
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:59,247
Hi, Leão, thank God you're here.

1419
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:00,498
Come, come.

1420
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:04,753
Oh, Leão,
I think he's having a heart attack.

1421
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:06,755
Calm down. I'm gonna check.

1422
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:09,466
Adolfo, how do you feel?

1423
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:10,884
Uh, Doctor, I...

1424
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:14,220
No talking.
This all happened because you spoke.

1425
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:16,973
I'm feeling better.
There's no need to stop the wedding.

1426
01:22:17,057 --> 01:22:19,684
You heard the man.
I do charge by the hour.

1427
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,561
Dr. Leão,

1428
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:25,982
while I know black makes me look slimmer,
I'm just not ready to become a widow.

1429
01:22:26,691 --> 01:22:29,694
Shh, shh. I must ask you to keep quiet.

1430
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:33,073
Stay quiet for just a bit,
so I can check him out, okay?

1431
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:35,116
I have to pay attention.

1432
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,534
- Okay.
- Shh.

1433
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:53,134
Uh...

1434
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,095
Unfortunately,

1435
01:22:55,595 --> 01:22:59,182
Mr. Adolfo is suffering
from an extreme case

1436
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:02,185
of CO2 accumulation

1437
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:06,439
between his diaphragm
and his abdominal region.

1438
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:07,649
Oh...

1439
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:09,316
What is that?

1440
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:11,568
- Gas.
- Oh!

1441
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:14,739
It's just gas.

1442
01:23:17,617 --> 01:23:18,910
It's gas.

1443
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,912
- You're so silly.
- It's gas.

1444
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:24,332
- Why did you say "unfortunately"?
- Just give it a second...

1445
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,584
There.

1446
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:29,921
I did warn you about that fried codfish.

1447
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,047
- Dad!
- Oh, Dad!

1448
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:35,051
Ivana, I really need to talk to you.

1449
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,512
Yeah, me too.
I really want to talk to you.

1450
01:23:37,595 --> 01:23:38,722
I found your phone.

1451
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:42,392
So the wedding is happening?

1452
01:23:42,475 --> 01:23:44,185
No wedding, no payment.

1453
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:45,729
No wedding, no payment, right?

1454
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:48,148
I know I ended things abruptly and I...

1455
01:23:48,231 --> 01:23:49,566
Her, she's an attorney.

1456
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:50,649
You.

1457
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:53,111
- Aren't you an attorney? Come with me.
- Me?

1458
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:55,280
- No, I...
- Come and help me right now.

1459
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:59,117
This wedding is happening.
I'll call the Pope if I have to.

1460
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:19,596
All right.

1461
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:26,269
Oh, my God.

1462
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:28,521
How am I gonna do this?

1463
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:31,191
This is crazy!

1464
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,526
Okay.

1465
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:36,279
I'm so very happy for you. Really!

1466
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,657
I pronounce you

1467
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:42,077
husband and husband.

1468
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,996
You may now kiss one another.

1469
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:46,998
Say a little more!

1470
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,500
Play the role.

1471
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:50,668
More?

1472
01:24:50,752 --> 01:24:51,961
Um...

1473
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:53,296
What else should I say?

1474
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:54,881
Talk about love, darling.

1475
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:57,008
No, I don't know how to...

1476
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:59,094
Yes. Yes, you do.

1477
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:04,933
Love...

1478
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:06,184
Love...

1479
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:07,977
...is...

1480
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:09,145
...is...

1481
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:17,153
I'm just incredibly
proud of you, my baby brother.

1482
01:25:18,571 --> 01:25:19,739
So proud of you.

1483
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:25,829
You have always taken responsibility
for your choices, and I...

1484
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,957
I wanted to be like that.

1485
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:31,793
I wish I could be just like you.

1486
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,800
But that's very hard to do.

1487
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,930
It's hard to stop caring
about the opinions of other people.

1488
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:48,268
- In that sense, I'm very stupid.
- Stupid.

1489
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:50,520
She's very stupid.

1490
01:25:50,603 --> 01:25:52,897
Stupid. Yeah.

1491
01:25:53,481 --> 01:25:54,524
Very stupid.

1492
01:25:56,693 --> 01:26:00,613
If I could go back in time,
I would tell someone my feelings.

1493
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,950
But I think it's too late
to tell them now.

1494
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,160
Anyway, now...

1495
01:26:06,202 --> 01:26:07,202
Say it to him!

1496
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:09,038
Say it to him!

1497
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,082
- Tell him?
- Yeah.

1498
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:12,708
Leão?

1499
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:17,713
Leão.

1500
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,595
I never said you were too small for me.

1501
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:25,972
I was just talking about the office.

1502
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:29,058
He is a lion, not an office.

1503
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:34,147
You're, without a doubt,
the greatest man I've ever known.

1504
01:26:34,772 --> 01:26:36,316
You're so special to me.

1505
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:39,694
And I feel good when I'm with you.

1506
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:43,489
<i>Whenever I'm with you,
I can't think about anything else.</i>

1507
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:46,868
<i>It's like my head is spinning.</i>

1508
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:49,412
<i>My whole body starts shivering.</i>

1509
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:52,957
<i>It's like the world had stopped around us,</i>

1510
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,919
<i>like there's only us two.</i>

1511
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:57,420
Yeah.

1512
01:26:57,503 --> 01:26:59,839
Ivana loves lions.

1513
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:03,092
But we're in the middle
of a ceremony right now, so...

1514
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,888
- What should I say now?
- If anyone opposes...

1515
01:27:06,971 --> 01:27:08,598
- Yes.
- Ha-ha!

1516
01:27:08,681 --> 01:27:14,270
If there's anyone in attendance
who opposes this beautiful wedding,

1517
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:17,106
please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

1518
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,024
Me.

1519
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:19,400
What?

1520
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:23,196
No, no, I don't oppose anyone.

1521
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:26,950
I don't oppose anything.
You all look great in here...

1522
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:29,452
This whole ceremony is so beautiful.

1523
01:27:29,535 --> 01:27:32,121
I don't think this hospital
has ever looked this pretty.

1524
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,334
I... I'll speak very briefly.

1525
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:37,919
Very briefly.

1526
01:27:39,545 --> 01:27:41,172
Thank you...

1527
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:43,216
Well...

1528
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:46,802
Uh...

1529
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,305
Can you help me?

1530
01:27:58,106 --> 01:27:59,106
Uh...

1531
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:04,070
I've always had to work extra hard
to get what I wanted in life.

1532
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:08,032
Maybe that's the reason
I'm a bit proud, you know?

1533
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:12,787
I never could allow other people
to say or do things on my behalf.

1534
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,708
I really believed that I was capable

1535
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:19,085
of doing it all myself.

1536
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:23,339
I also thought I knew everything
there was to know about hearts,

1537
01:28:23,423 --> 01:28:25,300
but then when you appeared,

1538
01:28:26,092 --> 01:28:27,092
in my life,

1539
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,345
you taught me how my own heart works.

1540
01:28:30,346 --> 01:28:32,181
So then, if you'll accept me,

1541
01:28:32,765 --> 01:28:34,892
if you'll dive into
this adventure with me,

1542
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:38,396
I can promise you that this time,

1543
01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:40,106
I won't let you go.

1544
01:28:40,189 --> 01:28:41,774
Aw!

1545
01:28:41,858 --> 01:28:43,318
What did he say?

1546
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:48,031
Oh, he's just being sentimental.
Wasn't it beautiful?

1547
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:54,078
He's a very small guy,
but those were very big words.
