1
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,013
- This is how a Styrolian does it.

2
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,183
- Those like myself have no families.

3
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,680
- I just can't believe
you'd hurt someone you love.

4
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:51,775
- Hold it right there!

5
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,023
- Just find him.

6
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,093
Kill him.

7
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,473
- You do anything to my
sister and you're a dead man!

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,150
- In history we learned about
the last of the 20th century.

9
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,500
- Repeat readout on holding speed.

10
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,147
- 28 KKM.

11
00:01:45,014 --> 00:01:45,847
- Check.

12
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,470
I'm initiating orders to
advance to warp speed two

13
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,573
in order to monitor turning capabilities.

14
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,610
- Perfect fly
by 8-98, at full warp two

15
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,500
acknowledge and prepare for
additional flight instructions.

16
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,650
- Affirmative, command.

17
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,550
Advance to warp speed two.

18
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:14,703
This ship is the most
responsive ship I've ever flown.

19
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,903
- Awesome.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,230
- Tell me something, Stanyo,
does it ever bother you

21
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,373
that they only used tubers to test fly?

22
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,373
- Tubers are expendable, you know that.

23
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,490
- At least they give us a
little adventure in our lives.

24
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,360
- Well, Kalif, I still don't like

25
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,013
being considered expendable.

26
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,220
- Activate warp speed.

27
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,570
- Approaching warp speed.

28
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,250
- Ignition in five seconds.

29
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,250
- Four, three, two, one, mark.

30
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,880
- Mark, begin sequence one
at 4,000 units per second.

31
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,310
- 4,000.

32
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,803
Four-five.

33
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:00,340
5,000.

34
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,410
Five-five.

35
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,243
- Energise.

36
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,550
Begin sequence number two at 8000 units.

37
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,320
- Affirmative, approaching 8000 units.

38
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,153
- Energise.

39
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,150
- Warp two in effect and holding.

40
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,530
- Command, this is Styro 8-9-8,

41
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,220
ready to receive additional instructions.

42
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,150
- 8-9-8, this is Flight Command.

43
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,450
During the next few manoeuvres,

44
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,150
activate relay computer system
for effectiveness readout.

45
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,080
- Affirmative, Command.

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,715
Stanyo, activate relay computer.

47
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,160
Maintain full

48
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,490
warp two speed.

49
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,964
- Full warp two.

50
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,610
- Bank left.

51
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,853
- That was too close.

52
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,023
- On my order,
bank right 45 degrees.

53
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,730
- Standing by, Command.

54
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,573
- Bank right 45 degrees.

55
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,543
Excellent, now I want you to
try a bank 90 degrees right.

56
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,600
- Command, we seem to be having a problem

57
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,260
with this 90-degree manoeuvre.

58
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,450
- We observed, 8-98.

59
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,223
All right, ease off, ease off.

60
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,290
Directly upon descent,
report to Operations

61
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,270
for debriefing and your new
assignments, Command out.

62
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,580
- New assignment.

63
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:30,326
How about that?

64
00:04:31,743 --> 00:04:33,593
I think we have graduated.

65
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,570
Command thinks we must be ready

66
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,950
for our first real assignment.

67
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,957
- Yes, well, we'll know soon enough.

68
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,370
I think I can have it arranged

69
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,310
for you to be assigned
to the Delta Territory.

70
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,246
- Guarding the old people's asteroids?

71
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,163
No, thanks.

72
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:52,023
How about Mars or Earth?

73
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:53,894
- Earth.

74
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,020
Hm, they have beautiful
fighter ships there.

75
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,047
- Outmanoeuvring an Earth ship.

76
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:04,753
That's my kind of duty.

77
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,150
- Then the ship refused to
respond to the 90-degree turn.

78
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,860
- Your
report appears complete.

79
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,120
The computers will analyse your input.

80
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,060
Your new orders are effective immediately

81
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,200
and are as follows,

82
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,000
Stanyo 12, you will report immediately

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,870
to flight command QD for
transport to Mega Vector.

84
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,730
Report to Master Commander Villhelm.

85
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,770
You are now dismissed.

86
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:44,603
- Yes, sir.

87
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,470
- Kalif Seven,
you are hereby assigned

88
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,610
to fly Earth reconnaissance
with Space Major Gropper.

89
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,720
You will command the mission.

90
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,150
No weapons are assigned.

91
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,890
Repeat, no weapons are assigned.

92
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,020
We're interested in obtaining
close-range photographs.

93
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,810
Security informs us that
a new Earth weaponry base

94
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,290
has been established in
the southwest quadrant

95
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,520
of the continental United States.

96
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,690
This mission is vitally
important to Styrolia,

97
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,450
and it will be security classified.

98
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,880
Repeat, security classified.

99
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,060
You will discuss it with no one.

100
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,653
That is all, Kalif
Seven, you are dismissed.

101
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,540
- Did you draw Mega Vector, too?

102
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,763
- No.
- Well?

103
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,930
- My mission is a classified one, Stanyo.

104
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,780
I'm afraid I can't say anything more.

105
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,903
- Classified usually
means an Earth flight.

106
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,673
- I can't.

107
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,310
- I sure wish we were
gonna be flying together.

108
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,790
- So do I, Stanyo.

109
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,280
- So now we fly with the real men.

110
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,880
- Well at least we'll be flying.

111
00:06:59,177 --> 00:07:00,010
Good luck.

112
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,495
- I wish you the same, Kalif.

113
00:07:58,442 --> 00:08:02,109
- Sector three, non-life
bearing craft only.

114
00:08:05,783 --> 00:08:07,842
And sector five clear.

115
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,183
Sector nine clear.

116
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:25,200
- Star 80 to command, Arina,

117
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,963
my search screens show no
sign of enemy activity.

118
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,420
- Patrol craft
seven to Control Centre,

119
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,167
reporting space zone J-19 clear.

120
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:43,430
Repeat, space zone J-1-9 clear.

121
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,760
This is patrol seven, end report.

122
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,593
- Affirmative, patrol

123
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:47,426
craft seven.

124
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:50,940
Space centre confirms a
negative activity in J-19.

125
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,620
Proceed to space zone K-12, repeat,

126
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,460
confirmation of zero activity.

127
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,023
Proceed to next designated
patrol area, Control out.

128
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,300
Patrol craft three, Control Centre ready

129
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,030
to receive transmission, go ahead.

130
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,580
- God I hate working these night shifts.

131
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,539
I get so damn bored.

132
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:11,170
- Yeah, I wouldn't mind
seeing a little action myself.

133
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,760
- Yeah, speaking of which,
uh, what are you doing

134
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,220
after you get off tonight, Jet?

135
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,500
- Going to bed.

136
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,034
- Uh, you care for a little company?

137
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:23,300
- Not a chance, one
date with you is enough.

138
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,480
- Hey, I thought we
were pretty compatible.

139
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,020
- Well I'm sure, you figure
you're com and I'm patable.

140
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,414
No thanks.

141
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:33,623
- Strike three.

142
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,270
- Oh yeah?

143
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,770
Well what are you doing
after the shift, hotshot?

144
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,020
- The usual.

145
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,740
- Oh not the laser artillery range again.

146
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,790
Man, you got no class.

147
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,100
- I have to be ready
for anything, you know?

148
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,393
- Yeah, but every night?

149
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,810
- Alert status must be maintained.

150
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,400
There's no room in our forces
for lackadaisical attitudes.

151
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,730
- My draught board didn't seem to mind.

152
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,563
No seriously, look it,

153
00:09:57,563 --> 00:09:59,690
why don't we grab a
couple of alco six packs.

154
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,390
We'll jump in my semigrav
and go into the city.

155
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,420
She's got 18 dirathium power
boosters, she really moves.

156
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,250
- Maybe another time.

157
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,130
- No really, we'll go in
and we'll have a little bite

158
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,380
to eat at the Orbit Room
and then we'll hit a few

159
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,850
pleasure centres on the way back out.

160
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,590
- Sorry, not my cup of tea.

161
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,360
- What's with you, Rodman?

162
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,110
Don't you know how to have any fun?

163
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,540
- There's a war going on.

164
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,810
Some of us take our responsibilities

165
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,100
more seriously than others.

166
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,560
- And what the hell is
that supposed to mean?

167
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,040
- You guys cut it out.

168
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,041
Now we've got eight
hours to go on this shift

169
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,540
and I'm not gonna spend the time

170
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,913
listening to another of
your stupid arguments.

171
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,407
- I'd hardly call being
supportive of Earth's position

172
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:37,760
in the Styrolian war stupid.

173
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,100
- Oh, here we go again.

174
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,010
Another tirade on why we should stand up

175
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,604
and cheer for the biggest
military blunder of them all.

176
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:47,370
- Blunder, we didn't
start the war, they did.

177
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,730
- Oh yeah, well I don't
see the military geniuses

178
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,080
who head operations in
any big hurry to end it.

179
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,580
Hell, it's been over 20 years.

180
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,563
- The enemy's still out there.

181
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,590
- You gotta be kidding, Blake.

182
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,460
There hasn't been a penetration
of Earth's atmosphere

183
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,310
in over five years, what's the point?

184
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:06,050
- The point is they could launch

185
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,773
a major attack again at any time.

186
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:10,400
- The only thing I've seen on the screen

187
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,587
in the last six months
is our own patrol craft.

188
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:14,270
Now don't you understand?

189
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,500
Styrolia is as sick of fighting as we are,

190
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,510
or at least some of us.

191
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:21,660
- Well I'm not lettin'
them catch me off guard.

192
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,540
I'll be ready for the
fight whenever they are.

193
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,820
- You career soldiers are a real

194
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,570
pain in the--

195
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,093
- What is it?

196
00:11:34,223 --> 00:11:36,273
- Space sentry two's picked something up.

197
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:40,587
Yeah, you can see it now.

198
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,236
- Read outs indicate
the craft is Styrolian.

199
00:11:47,236 --> 00:11:48,843
- No it's too hard to tell yet.

200
00:11:48,843 --> 00:11:51,913
- Send space sentry two in
for a confirmation check.

201
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,630
- Breen, I'm going to run a weapons test.

202
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,650
- Negative.
- Using that space sentry

203
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,483
as a target.

204
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:11,840
- Negative, our
instructions state negative.

205
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,270
You may be in charge of the assignment

206
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,710
but I'm in charge of the Zorian.

207
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,430
No weapons fired until I give the command.

208
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,260
- Gropper, let
the tuber have his way.

209
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,120
Our turn will come, old timer.

210
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,710
- Breen.
- Hey if there's gonna be

211
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,890
action we'll be in better shape
if we change our position.

212
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,850
Remember, that sentry has alerted

213
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,110
every Earth patrol in the area.

214
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,920
I don't like the idea they
know right where we are.

215
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,790
- So we're in an agreement,
evasive flight plan's mandatory.

216
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,480
- Flight plane adjustment .08.

217
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,313
- Mark.

218
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:42,500
- Mark, sequence attitude even.

219
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,643
- Even, and ignite.

220
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:57,773
- Tag one to control,

221
00:12:57,773 --> 00:13:02,120
intruder ID two Styrolian
one-man fighter patrol craft.

222
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,690
- Confirmation complete.

223
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,180
The two space crafts are one man

224
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,113
Styrolian reconnaissance fighters.

225
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,813
- What are they up to, anyway?

226
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:11,183
- I don't know, they're on the move now.

227
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,550
Send two patrol crafters on Q-73.

228
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,840
Tell 'em it's an interceptor alert.

229
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,680
- And you'll wanna get ahold
of Command Central too,

230
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,513
they'll wanna know about this.

231
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:20,530
- All right, hey looks like

232
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,570
the night might liven up after all.

233
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,287
- Yeah man, you were right, I'm sorry.

234
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:27,250
- Don't worry about it, now just get 'em.

235
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,550
- Control Centre calling
patrol craft 19 and 26.

236
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,950
Interceptor alert, emergency.

237
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,478
Proceed to zone Q-73 immediately, repeat,

238
00:13:36,478 --> 00:13:37,537
proceed to zone Q-73 immediately.

239
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:48,160
- I remember, tuber,

240
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,560
I remember when an entire
armada of fighters and space

241
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,793
cruisers were attacking the Earth colony.

242
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,463
I was commanding a laser
garrison on one of the cruisers.

243
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,203
They threw every ship they had at us.

244
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,800
Nova destroyers, proton bomb launchers,

245
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,090
but they couldn't stop us.

246
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,423
And I personally had six kills.

247
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,583
Let me tell you something
tuber, once on a special patrol,

248
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,000
four kills with my bare hands.

249
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,243
Ah, what a sensation.

250
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,250
Warm human blood flowing,
firing a furnace of emotion.

251
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:35,330
Oh, tuber, and when you agitate them...

252
00:14:36,361 --> 00:14:37,987
It's a strange planet, Earth.

253
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,053
Feelings never experienced
elsewhere in the galaxy.

254
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,070
And no better feeling than to watch

255
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,483
an Earth ship being blasted apart.

256
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,853
But now, where are we now?

257
00:15:05,047 --> 00:15:07,713
The major attacks, they've ceased.

258
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,640
- For good reason.

259
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,650
Our economy was in a state of
collapse after years of war.

260
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,720
- We were annihilating them.

261
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,250
We Styrolians would be rulers

262
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,913
of this entire quadrant of the galaxy.

263
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,763
Now we do nothing.

264
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,993
There's no honour left for
those of us who led the fight.

265
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,650
- There is honour in
having served the fleet

266
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,550
and having obeyed orders, that is all.

267
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,120
The fight, as you call it, exists

268
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,605
not for our own purposes but for Styrolia.

269
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:45,080
- For me,

270
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,810
for veterans like me
the fight will continue

271
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,590
and nothing will stop it, nothing.

272
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,510
- I would hardly refer to
this reconnaissance mission

273
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,990
as continuing the fight.

274
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,900
- True, tuber, but
fleet command allowed me

275
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,320
to make one slight modification
to our flight itinerary.

276
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,426
- Modification?

277
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,327
What modification?

278
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:13,218
- This, tuber.

279
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,430
- Our mission makes no
mention of any extra armament.

280
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,140
- You don't worry about
the mission, tuber.

281
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,563
You just fly this ship!

282
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,230
- Enemy patrol ships
approaching, two in number.

283
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,563
Sector eight!

284
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,040
Activate molecular shields.

285
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,611
- Star 80 to Zurand, ready!

286
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:40,956
All systems on manual.

287
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:44,931
Computer advises attack
approach Z-8-4 optimal.

288
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:45,945
- Affirmative.

289
00:16:45,945 --> 00:16:48,900
Z-8-4 implementation in effect.

290
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,640
Fire boosters on computer count.

291
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,423
Four, three, two, one, ignite!

292
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:57,700
Reverse thrusters,

293
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,920
they'll have us in range any second,

294
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,577
flight plan adjustment mandatory.

295
00:17:01,577 --> 00:17:05,253
React, react!

296
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:06,590
Crazy tuber!

297
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,550
Our shields won't protect
us from a head-on blast!

298
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,536
Those Earth ships carry
neutron laser rays.

299
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,521
- Just stay alert to my
command to fire those lasers!

300
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,166
- Now it's my turn.

301
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,740
- I said wait for my command!

302
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,604
- No!

303
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:33,640
No, they're malfunctioning.

304
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,150
- Overheating due to firing frequency.

305
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,170
- It's not my fault.

306
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,490
- I'm not saying it's your fault.

307
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,230
- It has to be a design flaw.

308
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,210
- Take control of the main guns

309
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,390
and keep them on automatic range.

310
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,730
If they fail, the only thing to blame

311
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,630
will be the ship's computer.

312
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,210
- All right, what's Breen doing?

313
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,360
- He's holding his own.

314
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,870
- We lost contact with 'em.

315
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,880
Where'd they go?

316
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,520
- I can't see them.
- Well, find them!

317
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,770
- The scope'll find them.

318
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:06,804
There, sector two.

319
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:09,996
Just give me a minute, we'll
be right back on top of 'em!

320
00:18:09,996 --> 00:18:13,079
- Gropper, I'm
right onto 'em, here we go!

321
00:18:20,671 --> 00:18:21,783
I got him Gropper, I got him!

322
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,280
- Good, good Breen.

323
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,810
How does it feel?

324
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,643
- Ah, like the old days.

325
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:30,679
Did you see the way that
Earth ship blew when I hit it?

326
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,620
Oh man.

327
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,620
- Oh my god.

328
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,740
- Just a second sir, what's wrong.

329
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,070
- The Styrolians, they just
hit one of our interceptors,

330
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,140
it just vanished from the screen.

331
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,520
- Get a confirmation on that.
- I'm trying.

332
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,750
- Yes?

333
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,930
That's right you heard correctly.

334
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:47,610
Enemy action, looks like we
may have suffered a casualty.

335
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,963
Yes sir, thank you sir.

336
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:53,820
- It's like I said,
there's not a trace left.

337
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,470
- Any luck?
- Patrol craft 19 and 26,

338
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,720
acknowledge!

339
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,780
Control Centre calling
patrol craft 19 and 26!

340
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,060
- This is PC-26 reporting,

341
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,330
we've made contact, repeat,
contact established.

342
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,270
Response is hostile, PC-19 eliminated.

343
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,910
How 'bout some help up here?

344
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:13,150
- Patrol Craft 26, this is control.

345
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,120
We're doing what we can.

346
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,979
Prepare for sentry
self-destruct in your zone.

347
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:18,011
- Affirmative and out.

348
00:19:18,011 --> 00:19:21,377
Breen, 42 degrees, Breen!

349
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:22,406
Breen!

350
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,453
- He slammed into a space sentry.

351
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,553
How, how could he have miscalculated?

352
00:19:51,194 --> 00:19:56,070
- He did, he miscalculated.

353
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,870
- Maintain position, patrol
craft 3, maintain position.

354
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,100
Potential enemy activity anticipated

355
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,213
in all Earth space zones, Control out.

356
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,604
- Which of you is Rodman?

357
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:10,510
- I'm Lieutenant Rodman, sir,

358
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,830
Operations Coordinator for this sector.

359
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:13,663
- Any further report, Lieutenant?

360
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:15,580
- We've just scored an enemy kill.

361
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,760
There remains one more intruder but our

362
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,200
interceptor seems to have the upper hand.

363
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,360
- Is there any indication
of Styrolian activity

364
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,850
in any other space zone?

365
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,080
- Negative sir, Ensign
Hamlin is nevertheless

366
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,360
following Fleet command directives

367
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,250
and having all patrol
craft maintain position

368
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,020
in the event of further hostile activity.

369
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,853
- Excellent.

370
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,350
I want a complete status check on this

371
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,887
entire operation in 10 minutes.

372
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,660
- The Earth patrol,
they're right on top of us!

373
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,493
- Affirmative.

374
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:50,222
They're moving in behind us.

375
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:51,710
What're we gonna do?

376
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,120
What?

377
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,992
- Outmanoeuvre them.

378
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,953
Tuber I,

379
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,110
I'm not sure just how much more pounding

380
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,757
the molecular shields can take.

381
00:21:05,757 --> 00:21:08,170
- The ship is beginning to lose control.

382
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,080
We've got only one alternative.

383
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,490
- Descend to surface.
- Affirmative!

384
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,340
I can put this down with your knowledge

385
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,730
of Earth's terrain, we have
a possibility of survival.

386
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,780
- What's your conclusion?

387
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,710
- Well it's hard to say.

388
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,130
This computer analysis
indicates the remaining

389
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,710
Styrolian fighter has extra armaments,

390
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,080
but there's no indication
that it's been used

391
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,750
for more than just a few seconds.

392
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,570
- PC-26 reported they observed a variation

393
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,470
from the standard Styrolian artillery.

394
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,400
- Well if the extra guns do exist,

395
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,620
there has to be more than one person

396
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,582
aboard that ship to operate it.

397
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:56,823
- No, not necessarily.

398
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,040
- It looks like the flight was headed

399
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,440
towards the Earth's surface.

400
00:22:04,246 --> 00:22:06,013
I'll be damned.

401
00:22:08,366 --> 00:22:10,540
The Styrolian is boxing himself in.

402
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,733
- Patrol craft 26 reporting in sir.

403
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,590
- PC-26 calling Control Centre.

404
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,660
- Go ahead PC-26, this is
General Elsiner, we're with you.

405
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,660
- We've got 'em
on the run, General.

406
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,580
Once they're within
surface support's range,

407
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,890
they won't get away.

408
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,773
- Good job Captain, Control out.

409
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,160
Alert surface support.

410
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,520
I want three proton
launchers airborne now.

411
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,353
- Yes, sir.

412
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,813
This is Control, give me ground support.

413
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,250
- Okay, okay, okay, that's enough.

414
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,810
Ooh!
- Oh did I tell you we

415
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,770
had a good day at school!

416
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,000
In history we learned about
the last of the 20th century.

417
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,440
You know, the things Grandpa talks about!

418
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,010
- Goodnight, Cindy.

419
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,170
- Did you know Marissa got
one of those auto-canaries?

420
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,370
It sings, but I love Cleo, you know.

421
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,270
- Goodnight, Cindy.

422
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,523
- I love you, you're a great sister.

423
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,020
- I love you too, honey.

424
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,393
Now go to sleep.

425
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,153
Cindy sure is growing up.

426
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,580
You know, Grandpa even
after all these years

427
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,873
I still find myself missing mom and dad.

428
00:23:37,237 --> 00:23:41,700
I don't know, maybe it's because
this place never changes.

429
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,503
Same furniture, same everything.

430
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,500
The world keeps changing,
but the farm remains

431
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,800
exactly as if mom and dad were still here.

432
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,109
- It was this way when I grew up here.

433
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:56,790
When my daddy grew up, all the way back

434
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,893
to my great grandfather, Luke Carter.

435
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,763
It's his family's home place,

436
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,130
always has been, always will be.

437
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:11,130
- Grandpa, I've been
thinking, ever since they died

438
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,830
and we had to raise Jimmy and Cindy and

439
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,993
somebody had to do the housework and,

440
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,470
and look out after everyone and, well--

441
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,700
- Say what you're thinking girl.

442
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,713
- Oh, how do I say it?

443
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:32,530
I'd like to find someone.

444
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,650
I'd like a home of my own.

445
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,780
- Hm, been wondering when
you'd be bringing this up.

446
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,370
- It's just that night after
night I sit here after the kids

447
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,326
have gone to bed and I
just have these feelings.

448
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:46,550
- We feel what we feel.

449
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,100
- But Grandpa, a time
comes when people have to

450
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,223
let go of certain, of
certain ways of living!

451
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:56,270
Don't you see, the hate
you hold inside you

452
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,763
is going to destroy you!

453
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,980
Do you want the kids to
grow up unhappy like you?

454
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:06,230
You can't keep protecting
them from this world!

455
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,170
- This modern world of
yours killed my son!

456
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:13,131
Your daddy, killed your
mama, that's not something

457
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:14,798
I want for you kids.

458
00:25:16,137 --> 00:25:18,860
- You know, I've discovered something.

459
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,300
I can hold on to the love of mom and dad

460
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,773
without hating this world.

461
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,150
- Maybe you can, but not me.

462
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,520
- No, it's the same for everybody!

463
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,630
Sure there are some that
refuse to let go of their hate,

464
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,022
but that hate eventually consumes them

465
00:25:34,022 --> 00:25:35,733
in the same way it's consuming you!

466
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,630
- Now you listen to me!

467
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:39,170
I've been on this earth a good deal longer

468
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,982
than you have young woman!

469
00:25:40,982 --> 00:25:42,270
There was a time before when this world

470
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,400
was a good place to live for everyone!

471
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,360
But the politicians, the corporations

472
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,230
decided that what was out there

473
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,200
was more important than
what we had down here.

474
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,220
The results, aside from
a few farms like our own,

475
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,010
which I've done my damnedest to maintain

476
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,550
the way a farm should be, the
world is one long endless war,

477
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,733
grabbing up all the resources,
to keep up with your world!

478
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,340
People don't know the smell
of green grass in the spring.

479
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,863
The feel of cool dirt between their toes.

480
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:19,570
All they want is the newest,
shiniest, and fastest,

481
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,270
whatever it takes to satisfy them.

482
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,920
- That's not the important part.

483
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,813
- Oh it isn't?

484
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,030
What do you think it is that makes

485
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,540
everything work in today's society?

486
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,610
Runs those air surface
cars, runs all the gadgets

487
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,450
in every city around this world?

488
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,590
Dirathium, that's what.

489
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,620
- What's the got to do with it?

490
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,618
- I'll tell you what it has to do with it.

491
00:26:39,618 --> 00:26:41,360
It's Dirathium crystals
that Earth has been

492
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,610
fighting about with those
damn Styrolian monsters

493
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,443
all these years!

494
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,150
You say it has no part in our lives.

495
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,080
I remember the day those Styrolians

496
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,010
came flying across our land,

497
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,760
burning nearly all of it out
with those Dirathium rays.

498
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,530
I remember seeing your mama and daddy

499
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,493
out the fields when it happened.

500
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,280
I told myself I'd never
forget, as long as I live,

501
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,230
I'd look on this world is a lost cause.

502
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,930
As for those Styrolians,
well I could kill...

503
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:17,283
No, enough of that, time for bed.

504
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,773
Four a.m. still comes early.

505
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,160
- Goodnight, Grandpa.

506
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,890
- All the animals are
locked up and watered.

507
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,280
I left Matt and Blaze in
the lower pasture, okay?

508
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,540
- Fine.
- Grandpa gone to bed?

509
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,900
- A few minutes ago.
- Heard you and him arguing,

510
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,173
I'd never heard so many
words out of his mouth.

511
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,620
Is it okay if me and Vicious go out

512
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,581
to the pond for a few minutes?

513
00:27:40,581 --> 00:27:42,640
- Well it is kind of late.
- Oh please,

514
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,740
you just gotta let me!

515
00:27:45,461 --> 00:27:48,073
- Well, what on earth is that?

516
00:27:48,073 --> 00:27:50,390
- It's an atom polarizer, I made the money

517
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,270
selling frog legs to send away for it.

518
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,200
- Does grandpa know about this?

519
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,530
- Are you kidding, he'd skin me alive!

520
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,950
Put these wires in the water
like this and push here,

521
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,000
and zap, any frog within
five metres gets fried!

522
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,330
- Jimmy, how could you do such a thing?

523
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,080
- Oh please, you just gotta let me.

524
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:13,000
- Well, it's been a while
since we had frog legs.

525
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,670
- Great, come on Vicious
we've got things to do!

526
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,603
Come on Vicious!

527
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,213
- Don't forget to lock up!
- Don't worry.

528
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,810
- It's no use, we'll
just have to cope with

529
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,600
the ship's environmental system as it is.

530
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,377
- A few more revolutions and maybe,

531
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,713
maybe, damn!

532
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,070
You'd think this ship was Earth-made!

533
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,880
- Even if we could make the system work,

534
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,340
the hull of these reconnaissance vessels

535
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,150
were never designed
for this kind of speed.

536
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,360
- And especially in Earth's atmosphere,

537
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,040
but we have no choice.

538
00:29:08,837 --> 00:29:11,120
- Put enough distance between
us and the Earth patrol.

539
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,953
We're out of their laser range.

540
00:29:11,953 --> 00:29:15,363
Let's hope we don't burn up.

541
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,740
- Tuber, the hull's gonna separate!

542
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,800
We have to adjust our
flight plan immediately.

543
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,170
- Agreement,
I'll let the ship fall

544
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,427
into Earth's gravitational pull.

545
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:33,853
- Earth patrols.

546
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,800
- We've lost scanner contact,

547
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,400
they're too close to the ground.

548
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,560
- Any sighting yet, Commander?

549
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,710
- Not yet sir,
it's pretty black out here.

550
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,250
We're making a surface sweep based on

551
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,770
last coordinates of ,

552
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,770
they'll turn up sooner or
later, Surface Support out.

553
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,000
- See if you can raise the patrol craft.

554
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,870
- Patrol craft 26, this
is Control, come in 26.

555
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,830
- This is PC-26, Control.

556
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,520
- Can you give us your position?

557
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,510
- Not a chance,

558
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,100
lost track of my flight plane
when they moved down here.

559
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,420
Can't talk any longer, they
just pulled up behind me.

560
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,802
26 out.

561
00:30:10,865 --> 00:30:13,310
- You're staying in pursuit?

562
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,363
- I have no choice.

563
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,100
Any attempt to reverse
direction and climb back

564
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,023
would be useless.

565
00:30:19,171 --> 00:30:24,004
- Well they're going to pay,
tuber, they are going to pay.

566
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,027
Pull up tuber, pull up!

567
00:30:39,077 --> 00:30:41,193
- Guidance system is knocked out,

568
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,620
we're forced to stay on manual!

569
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,860
All we can do his run.

570
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,550
- Won't be running too far if you keep

571
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,103
flying at this low altitude.

572
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,100
- I've a slight lead on them.

573
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,243
One last alternative.

574
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,680
- Tell me what you want.

575
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,840
- Supercharge laser batteries!

576
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,727
- No!
- Do it!

577
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,280
- Batteries charging.
- Good.

578
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,937
- Know what you're gonna have to do?

579
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:15,200
You're gonna have to completely
reverse flight direction,

580
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,210
if this blast is gonna work.

581
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,645
- Agreement, but I think
I've found just the place...

582
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,500
On command shut down all the
interior and exterior lights.

583
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:31,963
Computer ready.

584
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:36,037
- Start firing status.
- On computer ready.

585
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,157
Now!

586
00:32:06,064 --> 00:32:09,650
- Hear that Vicious, it
sounded like thunder,

587
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,610
but it couldn't have been
thunder, it's a clear night.

588
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,340
Hey there's a big one, okay...

589
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,133
- I got him!

590
00:32:19,017 --> 00:32:22,730
- panels won't respond,
activate emergency power!

591
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:24,088
- Activated.

592
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,233
- That wasn't thunder,

593
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:40,560
I could have sworn I--

594
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,380
Hey, did you see that?

595
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,130
Come on vicious, let's take a look!

596
00:32:49,972 --> 00:32:50,805
- Gropper!

597
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:55,410
Gropper, Gropper, we
have to get out of here!

598
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,243
Gropper!

599
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:28,255
- What happened?

600
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:29,277
Kalif, what,

601
00:33:29,277 --> 00:33:30,670
what happened?
- The ship's destroyed.

602
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,230
- Destroyed, the ship, is destroyed?

603
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:36,213
Is it irreparable?
- See for yourself.

604
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:48,690
- Stuck here on this forsaken
planet Earth, without a ship!

605
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,920
Captive!

606
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,597
- We'll figure something out.

607
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:57,633
Now don't move, I'll take care of it.

608
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,090
You'll be all right, by
now the Earth Control

609
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:12,455
must have alerted their ground forces.

610
00:34:12,455 --> 00:34:14,655
- Or else they could
have spotted the crash.

611
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:17,170
- We're too exposed here.

612
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,259
We should move to a safer place.

613
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:43,020
- Sensor relays have
indicated radioactivity fallout

614
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,670
in the coastal mountain vicinity.

615
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,750
- What about visual contact?
- PL-59, which was in the

616
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,520
area reported sighting a faint

617
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,150
flash on the horizon, nothing more.

618
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:56,280
- All right, continue
a surface sweep until

619
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,570
ground search is in the area.

620
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,800
- Yes sir, PL-58 out.

621
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,843
- God dammit!

622
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,790
How the hell'd they get by us?

623
00:35:04,744 --> 00:35:05,687
How'd we lose 'em?

624
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,580
Try reaching the patrol craft again.

625
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,790
- General, you don't understand,

626
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,470
it's not as if he's simply not answering.

627
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,050
When I make the call my indicator level

628
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,500
shows zero response activity.

629
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,417
Now that would only happen if the--

630
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:17,423
- If the ship had blown up, I know that!

631
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:22,810
I know that, just try again anyway.

632
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:23,752
- Yes sir!

633
00:35:23,752 --> 00:35:25,750
That analysis just confirmed

634
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,550
the nature to fall out,
it correlates exactly

635
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,650
with the dirathium fuel
amounts onboard PC-26.

636
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,384
That flash must have
been the ship exploding.

637
00:35:32,384 --> 00:35:33,734
All right.

638
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,670
- Captain Warner is on
his way over here now sir,

639
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,900
he's the best search
squadron leader we've got.

640
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,580
He'll find that Styrolian
whether he's dead or alive.

641
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,062
- Come on Vicious, come on.

642
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,713
What is it Vicious,

643
00:35:46,713 --> 00:35:47,863
what is it, boy?

644
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,503
No, don't shoot, no!

645
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,133
Vicious, Vicious, what
happened, what did you do?

646
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,703
Why?
- No!

647
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,270
The earthling may be useful to us.

648
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,800
- Tuber, he can identify us.

649
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,500
He must be terminated.

650
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,300
- He can lead us to that
structure in the distance.

651
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,500
It must be his living
cubical, at least there

652
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,140
we can think of what we're gonna do next.

653
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,040
Besides, we need nutritional supplies.

654
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,490
- Will you convince the
earthling to cooperate

655
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,399
or he'll be terminated?

656
00:36:36,399 --> 00:36:38,550
- You're Styrolians!

657
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,423
- If you plan on staying
alive, you'll drop that light.

658
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,323
My comrade has very little tolerance.

659
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,903
I mean now!

660
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,250
- Should you further annoy or irritate me

661
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:55,631
there will be instant termination.

662
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:56,692
- Do you understand?

663
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:59,586
- Yes, sir.
- Now lead us out of here.

664
00:36:59,586 --> 00:37:01,044
- Yes sir.

665
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:15,702
- Shh!

666
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:34,998
Wow.

667
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,143
Do not be afraid and do
exactly as I tell you.

668
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,923
Get yourself and the young
one into the other room.

669
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,803
Sit!

670
00:38:27,233 --> 00:38:30,001
Gropper!

671
00:38:30,001 --> 00:38:31,056
Gropper!
- Hold it!

672
00:38:31,056 --> 00:38:32,153
- Grandpa!

673
00:38:32,153 --> 00:38:32,986
Grandpa!

674
00:38:35,412 --> 00:38:36,245
Grandpa!

675
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:48,711
- How is it?

676
00:38:50,151 --> 00:38:51,901
- I'm all all right.

677
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,713
Don't hurt them Gropper, we need them.

678
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,883
- You, woman!

679
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:06,500
That cord, bring it, and tie the old one.

680
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:20,060
- Help, Styrolians, please help us,

681
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,626
please anybody help us, oh.

682
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:50,399
No more communication.

683
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,823
You, put the old one in the chair.

684
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,809
- Don't kill him!
- Put the noose

685
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,142
around his neck.

686
00:40:40,278 --> 00:40:41,560
- Don't hurt him!
- Put it, put it

687
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,370
around his neck.

688
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,793
- Please don't hurt him!
- You need motivation.

689
00:40:52,776 --> 00:40:54,560
Now, tighten it.

690
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,110
- Please don't hurt him,
I'll do anything you want.

691
00:40:59,845 --> 00:41:01,178
- Yes, you will.

692
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:04,778
You, back!

693
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,790
- Don't hurt her!

694
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:08,623
- Stay back!

695
00:41:14,797 --> 00:41:15,714
Tighten it.

696
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:21,427
Oh that's not tight enough.

697
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:23,880
Really tighten it up,

698
00:41:24,723 --> 00:41:29,723
tighten it!

699
00:41:30,027 --> 00:41:33,163
You're no match for me old one!

700
00:41:33,163 --> 00:41:34,787
Right old one!

701
00:41:34,787 --> 00:41:36,653
- Stop hurting my grandpa!

702
00:41:37,652 --> 00:41:39,073
Stop hurting my grandpa!

703
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,843
- Please don't kill her!

704
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,412
Please don't hurt us!

705
00:41:50,423 --> 00:41:53,423
- If I kill, oh I'd kill all of you,

706
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:59,705
no witnesses...
- Gropper!

707
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,233
- How's the arm?

708
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,560
- It's all right.

709
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,893
- You and you, find him a place to rest.

710
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,410
- Untie the boy outside and bring him in.

711
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,011
- When I secure the old man.

712
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:22,284
Well help him, help him girl!

713
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:25,137
You in the back help him, help him!

714
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,180
- Captain Martin Warner reporting sir.

715
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,810
- At ease captain, step
over here will 'ya?

716
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,980
Marty, this is the last area that we had

717
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,660
verified contact with our patrol craft.

718
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:46,040
Commander Copis is keeping a
surface watch but so far he

719
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,240
hasn't turned up anything.

720
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,770
- Have there been any
more computer readings

721
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,500
from the general vicinity?

722
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,130
- There was a slight
detection of seismic movement

723
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,720
shortly after our ship blew up.

724
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,063
- Then possibly, just possibly

725
00:42:56,063 --> 00:42:57,563
the Styrolian crash-landed.

726
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,740
- Possibly, but to create even the

727
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,810
slight ground disturbance that was

728
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,300
picked up would have required
one hell of an impact.

729
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,650
Chances are better that it was caused by

730
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:08,800
delayed aftershock after PC-26 exploded.

731
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800
- Have you been able to pinpoint the area

732
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,957
where this seismic activity took place?

733
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:13,973
- Let me check.

734
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,270
Are you done yet with the cross-indexing

735
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,500
Lieutenant Woodbury?

736
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:18,630
- Just finished.

737
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:20,830
The seismic indicators
show that the source of the

738
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,400
ground disturbance is within a hundred

739
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,853
square mile area, about here.

740
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,190
- Then that's where we should begin.

741
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,660
Any further orders general?

742
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,557
- Just find him.

743
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:34,010
Kill him.

744
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,959
I want this operation wrapped up.

745
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:46,903
- Well.

746
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,920
How is he?

747
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,950
- Your friend needs help.

748
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,090
What have you done with Jimmy?

749
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:59,930
- Jimmy, what is Jimmy?

750
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,440
- My brother the boy.

751
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,970
- Boy?

752
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:07,710
Oh the young thing, he's safe
enough don't worry about him.

753
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,765
You help me with my tuber.

754
00:44:09,765 --> 00:44:14,765
Here, uh...

755
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,637
Let's see this...

756
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,780
What's wrong?

757
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,963
- There's something
burning inside my shoulder!

758
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,430
- Well a high compression microwave

759
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:33,190
shouldn't have any side effects.

760
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:38,190
Tell me, what the weapon, the
old man used, what was it?

761
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:41,143
- A shotgun.
- A shot gun.

762
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:43,683
And what does it do, what does it do?

763
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,120
What is the explosion, what
does it consist of, what?

764
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,350
- Small metal pellets.

765
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,500
- Small metal...
- Do not use the sprayer

766
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,080
it must raise the
temperature of the pellets!

767
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:57,150
- Small metal pellets.

768
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,453
Tuber, I cannot heal your shoulder.

769
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,000
Keep away!
- The wound should be cleaned.

770
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,920
- It hurts, let her clean it!

771
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,423
- You don't understand tuber!
- Let her help!

772
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,160
- Help.
- I need some water

773
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,240
and some antiseptic pads.

774
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,590
- Get it, get it!

775
00:46:37,856 --> 00:46:39,450
- The pellets should be removed.

776
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,273
I-I've never done this before!

777
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:47,913
Oh, I'll clean the wound,
keep it from getting infected.

778
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,713
This will sting--
- Wait!

779
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,493
I want to know, what is that?

780
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,063
- Whiskey.

781
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,003
- This, whiskey?

782
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:07,780
- Whiskey, take it--

783
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,613
- No!

784
00:47:09,603 --> 00:47:12,837
No, you we're going to poison him.

785
00:47:12,837 --> 00:47:13,867
- Why no--
- Yes you were

786
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:15,170
going to poison him!
- It won't hurt him,

787
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:18,370
it'll help him!
- Cleaning and bandaging

788
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:19,203
is enough!

789
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:24,263
Get on with it, on with it!

790
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:28,350
I'm going outside to get the boy,

791
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,050
if anything happens to him while I'm gone,

792
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:33,350
the boy will be terminated.

793
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,277
Do you understand?

794
00:47:35,277 --> 00:47:37,477
- I understand.
- Somehow I knew you would.

795
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,010
Small pellets which become embedded

796
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:00,860
in its targets, ridiculous.

797
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,453
Now what could I try it on?

798
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,660
Hey where are you going?

799
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,170
- Just want to make sure Cleo is okay.

800
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:13,803
- Cleo, what's a Cleo?

801
00:48:13,803 --> 00:48:15,553
- It's my pet canary.

802
00:48:17,338 --> 00:48:19,563
- Don't you think Cleo would like to,

803
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,100
fly about the room?

804
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,313
Enjoy some freedom?

805
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,805
- Well I guess so but Janet told me not to

806
00:48:26,805 --> 00:48:28,750
let her out of her cage.

807
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:33,680
- And you wouldn't dare disobey
Janet, would she old one?

808
00:48:35,154 --> 00:48:38,388
Do you know what I would
do if someone disobeyed me?

809
00:48:38,388 --> 00:48:39,221
Hmm?

810
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:43,540
- Don't let them hurt Cleo, Grandpa!

811
00:48:52,448 --> 00:48:53,484
- No!

812
00:48:53,484 --> 00:48:54,734
He killed Cleo!

813
00:48:55,747 --> 00:48:59,000
Janet why?
- What's going on Gropper?

814
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,663
- Gathering intelligence tuber.

815
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,140
Studying the effect of this
rather primitive weapon,

816
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,280
demonstrating a point,
that their weapons are

817
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:11,023
inefficient, undependable.

818
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,070
Your shoulder's bleeding.

819
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:19,893
- Get the boy.

820
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:22,550
- You're undependable.

821
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,470
I want that shoulder repaired!

822
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,470
And that's an order!

823
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,723
Old one, we haven't
finished yet, you and I.

824
00:49:35,259 --> 00:49:40,259
No, we haven't finished yet.

825
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,750
- Janet?

826
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:50,583
- Yes dear?

827
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,993
- I miss Cleo.

828
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,423
- I do too honey.

829
00:49:57,150 --> 00:49:58,493
Try to get some rest.

830
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:11,993
- Is the young one yours?

831
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:13,953
- My sister.

832
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,493
- Sister?

833
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:21,830
- Your shoulder needs attention.

834
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,490
- Your sister,

835
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,500
tell me what you feel
about her, I want to know.

836
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,940
- Well naturally I love her very much,

837
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,313
something you wouldn't understand.

838
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,690
- These are feelings
I've never seen before.

839
00:50:42,987 --> 00:50:44,730
- It hurts doesn't it?

840
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:48,142
- Yes, but I trust you.

841
00:50:53,792 --> 00:50:56,875
- I couldn't let you bleed to death.

842
00:50:57,723 --> 00:50:59,973
- You have much compassion.

843
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,450
I am sorry if any harm has come

844
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,007
to either you or your family.

845
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:05,403
- That's hard to believe!

846
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,890
You broke into my home,
you pointed a gun at us.

847
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,620
If you feel so badly about
it, why did you do it?

848
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,870
- We're trying to survive
in a strange world.

849
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,680
If Gropper has done anything to harm you

850
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,177
or your family, it is unfortunate.

851
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:24,664
But in view of what has happened to me,

852
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:27,664
there was little that could be done.

853
00:51:28,912 --> 00:51:29,829
I am sorry.

854
00:51:32,778 --> 00:51:34,111
- I'm sorry too.

855
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,100
- In our world when one
does harm to another

856
00:51:43,272 --> 00:51:44,730
it is automatically expected that they

857
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,180
will be terminated.

858
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:50,210
No matter who they may be.

859
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,653
- Do you mean that

860
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:54,940
if your mother and father

861
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,017
did something wrong
you'd bring harm to them?

862
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:03,639
- I cannot answer that question.

863
00:52:03,639 --> 00:52:04,472
- Why not?

864
00:52:06,903 --> 00:52:09,069
- I never had a mother or a father.

865
00:52:09,069 --> 00:52:12,320
What?

866
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,520
- I was artificially
created in a test tube.

867
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:17,240
I was raised in a nurturing centre.

868
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,510
I never had a mother or a father.

869
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:22,090
I have no concept of parents,

870
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:24,773
or parents and children, or sisters.

871
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:28,877
Therefore I cannot answer that question.

872
00:52:28,877 --> 00:52:31,593
- So that's why you were
asking me about my sister.

873
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,513
- That is why.

874
00:52:38,517 --> 00:52:40,310
- I just can't believe
you would bring harm

875
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:42,129
to someone you love.

876
00:52:42,129 --> 00:52:43,883
- Those like me have no families.

877
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:47,410
We are not permitted to
inter-relate on any level

878
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:48,793
of Styrolian society.

879
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,340
We are raised in a computerised technology

880
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:54,700
until mature, then we
become soldiers living

881
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,200
a life of obedience.

882
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,167
I am a tuber, that is all.

883
00:53:00,919 --> 00:53:03,178
- Do you have a name?

884
00:53:03,178 --> 00:53:05,595
- Yes, I have a name.

885
00:53:06,799 --> 00:53:07,882
- What is it?

886
00:53:08,888 --> 00:53:09,721
- Kalif.

887
00:53:10,991 --> 00:53:11,824
- Kalif.

888
00:53:15,009 --> 00:53:17,176
Kalif, I am also a tuber.

889
00:53:24,049 --> 00:53:26,632
- Then how can you, be sisters?

890
00:53:29,399 --> 00:53:31,183
- Often in our world when a man and woman

891
00:53:31,183 --> 00:53:33,935
want a child but can't have one,

892
00:53:33,935 --> 00:53:36,685
because of some physical problem,

893
00:53:37,527 --> 00:53:40,527
a child is created from a test tube.

894
00:53:41,498 --> 00:53:44,967
That child is raised as
though it were their own.

895
00:53:44,967 --> 00:53:46,450
- Why do they love it?

896
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,660
- Because of love!

897
00:53:53,938 --> 00:53:54,771
- Love...

898
00:53:59,061 --> 00:54:01,471
What is this concept, love?

899
00:54:06,637 --> 00:54:07,620
- Get up!
- Go to hell!

900
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,453
- Hey!

901
00:54:10,337 --> 00:54:12,657
How long, how high can I pull him

902
00:54:12,657 --> 00:54:15,050
before his arms break, huh?

903
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:15,914
- Stop it!

904
00:54:18,645 --> 00:54:20,812
Now, come here, come here!

905
00:54:25,457 --> 00:54:29,000
Now Grandpa, why aren't you laughing?

906
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,378
That's what she called
you isn't it, Grandpa?

907
00:54:31,378 --> 00:54:33,469
Why aren't you laughing?

908
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:36,136
I want you to laugh, or he dies!

909
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,150
- Gropper let him go!

910
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,870
I said don't hurt them, we may need them!

911
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:44,020
Come in here, we need
to discuss our plans.

912
00:54:48,307 --> 00:54:49,224
- You stay.

913
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,020
- I still say our best alternative is

914
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,460
to move on at first light.

915
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,293
- No.

916
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,873
We'd be too exposed, it's safer here.

917
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,700
- We're too close to
where the ship exploded.

918
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,910
The Earth Patrol is bound
to check this house.

919
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:14,120
- It would be to our benefit.

920
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,073
- How can that be?

921
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:20,160
- They check this
place, we terminate them,

922
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,840
we take their vehicles.

923
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,160
- We have no idea as to how many

924
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,400
troops they'll send.

925
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,150
- It can't be more than four or five.

926
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,943
It's too large an area to search.

927
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,500
- It is worth considering.

928
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,640
- You okay Grandpa?
- Hmm.

929
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,680
Just watch out for yourself son,

930
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,550
I'm real proud at how you handled things.

931
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,520
- They killed Vicious,
the mean guy did it!

932
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,830
- Vicious is dead?

933
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:50,020
- Yeah.
- No talking!

934
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:53,510
- Stick it!
- In view of your condition,

935
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:55,630
to move is impossible.

936
00:55:55,630 --> 00:56:00,630
If you die tuber, die like a soldier.

937
00:56:02,743 --> 00:56:05,502
No conversation, no talking!

938
00:56:05,502 --> 00:56:08,085
I'll explain, don't even think.

939
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:11,063
- See the gun, there?

940
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:14,513
- It's unnecessary!

941
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:17,330
These people may be different from us,

942
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,630
but they don't deserve
this kind of treatment!

943
00:56:21,398 --> 00:56:22,870
- We'll probably
die anyway, tuber,

944
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:26,043
so why not enjoy ourselves?

945
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:30,649
- I can't get it without him seeing me.

946
00:56:30,649 --> 00:56:32,843
- I'll try kicking
it under the couch.

947
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,840
- You seem to be forgetting
fundamental orders.

948
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,280
A basic tenet for each fleet
commander in flight training

949
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,380
is never to harm one's
adversary unnecessarily,

950
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,528
especially when they're civilians!

951
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:46,810
Now I don't need to explain to you

952
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:48,520
why that rule exists, do I?

953
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,920
- I know why tuber, unnecessary harm

954
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,210
to one's enemy, provides
a motivation to retaliate

955
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,983
which may not have existed
before, something like that.

956
00:57:00,886 --> 00:57:01,719
Hmm?

957
00:57:02,807 --> 00:57:05,450
Though I see little to fear in retaliation

958
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:08,173
from these creatures.

959
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:12,537
- I suggest we reconsider this
after we've had some rest.

960
00:57:12,537 --> 00:57:15,777
- Tuber I have nothing
further to discuss with you.

961
00:57:15,777 --> 00:57:16,610
Nothing.

962
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:20,433
I need you, if only to
get off this planet,

963
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,320
so let's take a look at that shoulder.

964
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:31,593
Not bad, I'll look at it later.

965
00:57:35,107 --> 00:57:36,550
- I think he's coming.

966
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:38,300
- Get it later.

967
00:57:40,104 --> 00:57:42,450
- Remember I don't want them harmed!

968
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:45,560
- Oh yes sir, mighty humanitarian!

969
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,903
No more violence!

970
00:57:57,539 --> 00:58:02,539
What are you doing, hmm?

971
00:58:03,064 --> 00:58:05,671
I thought I told you not to move!

972
00:58:05,671 --> 00:58:07,921
- Stop it he can't breathe!

973
00:58:11,482 --> 00:58:13,201
- I'll stop it,

974
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:14,868
only because of you.

975
00:58:17,872 --> 00:58:20,913
, live a little longer.

976
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:22,953
Now we sleep.

977
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:27,730
You, will leave the room
and take care of my tuber.

978
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,533
And shut that young thing up!

979
00:58:30,847 --> 00:58:33,554
You stay here, you boy on the couch!

980
00:58:33,554 --> 00:58:35,594
Move!

981
00:58:35,594 --> 00:58:38,511
- Janet, Janet, I'm scared!

982
00:58:40,052 --> 00:58:43,943
Shut up, shut her up!

983
00:58:43,943 --> 00:58:45,193
She bothers me.

984
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:41,790
- Oh I've got to check Grandpa and Jimmy.

985
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:44,620
- I checked, they're okay.

986
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:56,440
- I have to feed the animals.

987
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,300
Would you...

988
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:04,023
I mean, do you feel well
enough to go along with me?

989
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:17,060
- It's sore but, Gropper would
never let you go by yourself.

990
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:20,433
- Crazy.

991
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,873
You're both so different.

992
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:28,783
- Yes.

993
01:00:31,706 --> 01:00:33,670
- Cindy you like to come too?

994
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:34,503
- I'm scared.

995
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:36,420
- Go back to sleep.

996
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,260
But if you do get up, stay in the room,

997
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,820
and don't make any noise.

998
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:41,653
- Okay.

999
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:45,320
- Turn your head I want
to change my clothes.

1000
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:04,540
- Hey, where are you going?

1001
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:05,650
- The horses have to be watered and

1002
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:07,213
the animals have to be fed.

1003
01:01:07,213 --> 01:01:09,130
- Why?
- I'm going with her Gropper.

1004
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:10,120
Besides I need some fresh air,

1005
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,413
and we may need their animals.

1006
01:01:11,413 --> 01:01:12,663
- Go.

1007
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:27,437
- It feels so good to be
outside, away from him.

1008
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:32,437
- It's so very different here.

1009
01:01:48,862 --> 01:01:50,260
Why is part of that mountain so green

1010
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,230
and the other part so barren?

1011
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:55,803
- Years ago when the war with
your people was much larger,

1012
01:01:55,803 --> 01:01:58,403
a tremendous air battle
took place over those hills.

1013
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:01,380
The hills were seared with laser bombs,

1014
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,260
from you attacking Styrolians.

1015
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,860
- A few were responsible
for the hurt of so many,

1016
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,680
our people as well as yours.

1017
01:02:14,436 --> 01:02:15,830
The ones who want it the least are

1018
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:17,880
usually the people who are hurt the most.

1019
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,070
- I'm happy that you and
your family were not harmed

1020
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,665
by the fighting that took place here.

1021
01:02:23,665 --> 01:02:25,415
- My mother and father were killed.

1022
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:34,520
- I've been very confused about

1023
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,420
the meaning of parents,
but in the short time

1024
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,600
I've been here I've come to learn

1025
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,800
that there exists a strong bond

1026
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,450
between members of a family unit.

1027
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:47,660
And although I don't completely understand

1028
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:48,810
the significance of it,

1029
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,946
I do sense the depth of it.

1030
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:07,050
- We're just as
responsible for the death

1031
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:08,693
and destruction during this war.

1032
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:13,160
No conflict lasts so many
years unless both sides

1033
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,683
are unwilling to compromise.

1034
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,680
But enough about war, tell me,

1035
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,530
what was it like to live on Styrolia?

1036
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,863
- As children, a teacher,

1037
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:35,413
companion, sometimes
dictator, sometimes friend,

1038
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,553
is a computer.

1039
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:42,703
But mostly the computer is
our standard of how to live.

1040
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,540
The only people we ever meet

1041
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,593
are the young ones we grow up with.

1042
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:55,379
But then we're taught not
to become attached to them.

1043
01:04:21,033 --> 01:04:23,010
- Here we grow as individuals,

1044
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:24,260
learning from each other.

1045
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,610
And as we grow closer together,

1046
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:30,243
we become more aware of
each other's feelings.

1047
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,360
- I think I'm beginning to understand.

1048
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,183
But what of this concept, love?

1049
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:46,260
- Since life began on this
planet people have tried

1050
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:50,003
to explain love, with not much success.

1051
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:56,113
- What's that?
- Oats.

1052
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:59,823
- Oats?
- It's what the horses eat.

1053
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,300
- Why don't you use androids or robots

1054
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,209
to do these mundane kind of jobs?

1055
01:05:05,209 --> 01:05:07,770
- The whole point
of living this lifestyle

1056
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:09,370
is to stay in touch with nature!

1057
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:13,590
Come on, let's go feed the chickens.

1058
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,593
Okay, you can have more.

1059
01:05:44,050 --> 01:05:45,250
- What a curious animal.

1060
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,380
It's fascinating how
they all stay together

1061
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:49,630
in one group like that.

1062
01:05:51,384 --> 01:05:54,670
- You know, a couple of
nights ago a mother hen died.

1063
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:58,710
Her brood was adopted by another hen,

1064
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,320
and she instinctively began caring

1065
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,520
for the motherless
chicks just like her own.

1066
01:06:05,006 --> 01:06:05,839
Kalif,

1067
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,433
it's the same with people.

1068
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,270
You see once there's a sense
of caring between two people,

1069
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:16,270
love begins to grow.

1070
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:19,380
That's what you saw with Cindy and myself.

1071
01:06:21,224 --> 01:06:23,674
And that feeling exists
between parent and child.

1072
01:06:25,512 --> 01:06:27,329
Whether the child is created naturally,

1073
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:29,246
or through a test tube.

1074
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:35,574
That feeling is love.

1075
01:07:04,534 --> 01:07:07,034
You don't have to say a thing.

1076
01:07:17,163 --> 01:07:20,403
- What are you looking at old one?

1077
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,236
Show me!

1078
01:07:24,384 --> 01:07:26,967
Oh.

1079
01:07:28,235 --> 01:07:29,068
That's it.

1080
01:07:34,614 --> 01:07:35,447
Well.

1081
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:48,776
That's it.

1082
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:53,243
That damn tuber.

1083
01:07:54,094 --> 01:07:58,807
You know something old one, I
didn't think he had it in him.

1084
01:08:02,974 --> 01:08:05,307
But wait till my turn comes!

1085
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,400
- Search Quadrant
four calling Control,

1086
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,062
Search Quadrant four calling!

1087
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,650
- This is Control, Squadron four.

1088
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:33,640
- Enemy vessel located
at 3,000 feet elevation,

1089
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:36,750
in mountain region 18.
- Any sign of the pilot?

1090
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,011
- Negative.

1091
01:08:38,011 --> 01:08:41,240
The escape hatch was open
and the vehicle empty.

1092
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,020
Judging from the
condition of the wreckage,

1093
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:44,290
he must have been injured.

1094
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:45,900
He couldn't have gotten too far.

1095
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,294
- Consolidate forces
and saturate the area!

1096
01:08:48,294 --> 01:08:50,590
- Well regrouping's
already taking place.

1097
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:52,570
Odds are he's moved to lower ground,

1098
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:54,890
so we'll be concentrating
personnel to the north.

1099
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:57,130
- Fine, just keep us posted.
- Yes sir.

1100
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:58,403
Squadron four out.

1101
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:03,317
- Get our boys over at Security Analysis.

1102
01:09:03,317 --> 01:09:06,033
I want a search team on
that site in an hour.

1103
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:16,800
- Well I presumed you
took care of the animals.

1104
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,430
- For now yes.

1105
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:20,480
- Well that's good.

1106
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,163
Now it's my turn.

1107
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,843
You stand watch.

1108
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:32,850
Grandpa, I'm going to
check the animals now.

1109
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:34,353
- No Groppa.

1110
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:36,613
- Yes.

1111
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,063
- I said no.

1112
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:44,319
- Well all right tuber,
if that's what you want.

1113
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,560
Don't worry about him.

1114
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,760
I mean, anything you experienced
with a tuber like that,

1115
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:58,810
is nothing compared to what
you're gonna experience with me.

1116
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:01,880
Come here...
- No, oh please don't!

1117
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,114
- That's what I like, someone with spirit!

1118
01:10:04,114 --> 01:10:06,280
Spirit, right Grandpa?

1119
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,610
I tell you what Grandpa, I'll tell you

1120
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:10,378
all about it when I'm finished!

1121
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:19,961
- You do anything to my
sister and you're a dead man!

1122
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,833
Cindy, Cindy come quick!

1123
01:10:23,166 --> 01:10:24,905
- Where's Janet?

1124
01:10:24,905 --> 01:10:26,150
What happened to Kalif?

1125
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:28,280
- Never mind, just get
me a knife, scissors,

1126
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,673
anything, just get me out of these ropes!

1127
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:41,440
Hurry just cut it, hurry!

1128
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,273
- Dammit cry!

1129
01:10:43,503 --> 01:10:45,454
This is how a Styrolian does it!

1130
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:48,737
- Good Jim!

1131
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,810
Jim, my ropes, cut me out of 'em!

1132
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:55,480
- No time, I gotta help Janet!

1133
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:58,372
Get him out of his ropes!
- Cindy come on, that's it!

1134
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:16,858
- That was fun...
- No, no, no...

1135
01:11:21,188 --> 01:11:25,680
- Yeah, Styrolian style,
that's what I like!

1136
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:28,394
Come on, you're missing the best part!

1137
01:11:28,394 --> 01:11:29,227
- Stop!

1138
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:40,307
Keep away from my sister.

1139
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:46,593
Stop now or I'll shoot.

1140
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,863
Stop or I'll shoot!

1141
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,773
- I'd kill you right here,

1142
01:12:32,773 --> 01:12:34,270
but I think grandpa might

1143
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:35,123
enjoy watching.

1144
01:12:36,822 --> 01:12:40,220
Hey grandpa, you want
to witness an execution?

1145
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:42,863
- You'll pay, you'll pay!

1146
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,392
Now it's my turn!

1147
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,560
- Since I didn't want to shoot Janet,

1148
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:05,200
I waited until he was away from her.

1149
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,230
I distracted him all right!

1150
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:09,059
I almost had him right then and there!

1151
01:13:09,059 --> 01:13:11,810
But like I told you the gun didn't work.

1152
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:13,380
Finally he had me pinned
down and was ready

1153
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:15,850
to kill me and--
- Janet, come look!

1154
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,810
- Just tell me what you see honey.

1155
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,180
- There's two guys
sneaking outside the house,

1156
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:22,113
I could see them from the bedroom too.

1157
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:25,850
- She's right, as far as I can see

1158
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,320
it's an Earth Tactical Search Unit.

1159
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,750
I bet you they found the ship.

1160
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:30,790
- Jim, take Kalif into
Grandpa's bedroom and get

1161
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:32,810
him into a pair of
dungarees and a work shirt.

1162
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:33,643
- Okay, come on.

1163
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:38,040
- Go ahead, it's gonna be all right.

1164
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:40,370
Grandfather, I know we
haven't always agreed with

1165
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:43,740
each other, but, but please, please

1166
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,473
don't, don't turn Kalif in, please?

1167
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:51,560
- I'm Captain Warner, I'm
looking for a Styrolian.

1168
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:54,240
We found the remains of
his ship up on the hill.

1169
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,280
We assumed he escaped.

1170
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,770
Do any of you have any
information about him?

1171
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:02,770
- Yep in fact, Kal over there
had his head busted in by him,

1172
01:14:03,202 --> 01:14:06,120
, but we took
care of that old boy.

1173
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:08,090
You'll find what's left of him outside

1174
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:09,530
in back of the wood bin.

1175
01:14:09,530 --> 01:14:11,140
- Captain we found him behind the house

1176
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,090
shot full of holes.

1177
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:14,853
- We want to thank you.
- Oh that's all right just

1178
01:14:14,853 --> 01:14:19,170
haul his carcass away from
here, that'll be thanks enough.

1179
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:21,020
Now if you don't mind,

1180
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:23,930
we've had enough excitement
here for one day.

1181
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,950
- We'll contact you later if we need to.

1182
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,087
- Oh thank you grandpa, thank you.

1183
01:14:29,087 --> 01:14:31,270
- Now don't ask me why
I didn't turn him in.

1184
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:32,753
It's very simple.

1185
01:14:33,965 --> 01:14:36,870
The love I saw in your
eyes, reminded me of

1186
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:39,020
the look your mama used
to give your daddy.

1187
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:45,586
Besides, I could use an
extra hand here on the farm.

1188
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:50,823
- Yes, I understand Major, thank you.

1189
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:53,834
Well,

1190
01:14:53,834 --> 01:14:56,230
looks like you were right Lieutenant.

1191
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:57,800
- It was only logical.

1192
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,300
- When I heard about the--
- Captain Warner

1193
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:00,133
is calling in!

1194
01:15:00,133 --> 01:15:02,777
The Styrolian pilot, they found him.

1195
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,709
- This is Elsiner!

1196
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:06,040
I hear you got good news Marty!

1197
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,160
- That's right general,

1198
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,060
we found the alien, he was already dead.

1199
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:13,090
It seems this backwoods farm
family had terminated him.

1200
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:14,333
- What about the other one?

1201
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:15,840
- Another one, I, I don't know

1202
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,050
what you mean sir.

1203
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:18,910
- Security Analysis just
called in the report from

1204
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:22,500
the crash site, there were
two enemy personnel on board

1205
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,238
at the time of the crash.

1206
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:25,850
- Well if there
is another one out here,

1207
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:27,763
I'll get him sir.

1208
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:30,370
- I'm sure you will.

1209
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:32,493
Control out.

1210
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:31,653
- Earth, so much
different than I expected.

1211
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:35,289
So informal, simple.

1212
01:16:35,289 --> 01:16:37,960
- Well, don't judge all of Earth by what

1213
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,373
you see here at our ranch.

1214
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:43,210
By most standards ours is judged as

1215
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:44,803
an old-fashioned lifestyle.

1216
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:48,203
- I'm not complaining, I like it.

1217
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:52,060
And the people who live it.

1218
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,510
- Well if you went to
one of the big cities

1219
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:58,280
you might change your mind,
the people there all act as if

1220
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,530
they're out of some kind
of an assembly line.

1221
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:02,800
- Assembly line?

1222
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,963
- Yeah, you know, stamped
from the same cookie cutter.

1223
01:17:08,064 --> 01:17:09,528
- Cookie cutter?

1224
01:17:09,528 --> 01:17:11,611
- Uh, from the same mould.

1225
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:19,200
- Oh you mean like on Styrolia,
where people are born,

1226
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:23,080
raised and educated on an assembly line.

1227
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:27,170
- Well, I prefer you to most
Earth people I've known.

1228
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:31,690
- And I prefer you.

1229
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,153
- Well, let's drink to our preferences.

1230
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:12,403
- The old man's not
here, nor is anyone else.

1231
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:14,990
- Do we wait for them or search the area?

1232
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:16,500
- I say we search.

1233
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,240
Captain Warner's report indicated
four persons living here.

1234
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,410
An old man, a young adult
female and two children.

1235
01:18:22,410 --> 01:18:23,704
The neighbours to the east indicate

1236
01:18:23,704 --> 01:18:26,400
that there's an adult male here.

1237
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,480
They say he's been here
about a month and a half,

1238
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,140
described as about five foot, 11,

1239
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,810
maybe thirty years of
age, so what do you think?

1240
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:37,270
- Captain Warner also reported
seeing a male farmhand here.

1241
01:18:37,270 --> 01:18:39,623
- Did he check his papers?
- No I don't think so.

1242
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:43,053
- It must be our Styrolian, it all fits.

1243
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,720
They found one dead
but intelligence report

1244
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,720
indicates that there was two
of 'em, so there's one missing.

1245
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:52,500
- And suddenly a new
man appears on this ranch.

1246
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,930
- Right.

1247
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:56,530
Okay if he's not in the house,
he's certainly in the area.

1248
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:57,730
You check out the house again,

1249
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:59,480
- Okay.
- I'm gonna radio Command.

1250
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:06,860
This is search team Omega calling Command.

1251
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:11,040
Request search team Alpha,
group at vector 79A.

1252
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,710
- Lieutenant, look at this.

1253
01:19:18,380 --> 01:19:20,018
- Let's go.

1254
01:19:34,343 --> 01:19:36,380
- Take it easy Grandpa!
- What is it Grandfather?

1255
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:39,163
What's wrong?
- Federation Patrol security!

1256
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:41,880
- Where?
- At the house.

1257
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,580
I just saw them, heard them.

1258
01:19:44,644 --> 01:19:46,880
They're looking for you
Kal, they know you're here.

1259
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,550
- Oh my god!
- What do we do now?

1260
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:50,860
- I've got to get you away from her son,

1261
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:52,290
the sooner the better.

1262
01:19:52,290 --> 01:19:54,060
They're searching the area.

1263
01:19:54,060 --> 01:19:56,480
I heard them call up
another team to help them.

1264
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:59,230
I don't know where they are
now or where they're going.

1265
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:01,520
You can't go back to
the house because they

1266
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,660
probably have a guard there.

1267
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,960
I think you'll have to
head into the countryside.

1268
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,090
- What about provisions, weapons?

1269
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:09,990
- We'll make do with what we have.

1270
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:12,550
I'm praying we don't have to use weapons.

1271
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:14,440
- We can't send Kalif off by himself,

1272
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,723
he doesn't know the area!

1273
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,023
- Listen to me girl,

1274
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:22,460
we have no other choice
now, he can't stay here.

1275
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:24,413
He could be arrested and maybe killed.

1276
01:20:27,149 --> 01:20:29,549
How 'bout you Kal, what
do you think, any ideas?

1277
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:33,650
- Are there any civilian air
shuttle bases in this area?

1278
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:35,858
- About five miles east of here.

1279
01:20:35,858 --> 01:20:39,690
- If I can get to a ship,
any ship that can fly,

1280
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:40,943
I might stand a chance.

1281
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,003
Will you lead me?
- Let's go!

1282
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:01,733
- What do you think?

1283
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:06,023
- I think they've been
here just a short time ago.

1284
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:15,043
This way.

1285
01:21:38,674 --> 01:21:41,070
- He's out there alone?
- No I don't think so.

1286
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:42,180
Looks to me like the old man was

1287
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:44,780
covering for Styrolians, deliberately,

1288
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:48,050
whether he did it on his own
or was forced to, I don't know.

1289
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:50,090
We're just wasting time,
he's probably not alone.

1290
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:52,160
Alpha Team, you take the low ground,

1291
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:54,480
form a 40 degree sweep
northeast of the ranch.

1292
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:57,150
Gilbert and I will take
the Southwest sector.

1293
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:59,640
Get these things, set up a laser fence,

1294
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:01,610
form a circle around the quadrant.

1295
01:22:01,610 --> 01:22:02,443
Hit it.

1296
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:28,680
- Come on, hurry!

1297
01:22:45,686 --> 01:22:46,519
Ha!
- No!

1298
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:48,610
Fire only when you know you can hit him!

1299
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:50,166
I don't want the family hit!

1300
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:50,999
- Yes sir.

1301
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:54,300
- Circle around to the
right and sweep the area,

1302
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,802
report in every five minutes.

1303
01:22:55,802 --> 01:22:56,635
- Okay.

1304
01:23:57,743 --> 01:23:59,503
Back, back, back!

1305
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,172
We gotta keep moving, we're
like sitting ducks out here!

1306
01:24:07,597 --> 01:24:09,570
I know what you're trying to do!

1307
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:10,850
But hunting tricks don't change

1308
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:12,267
through the years.

1309
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:15,680
Come on we'll go back to
the other way, follow me!

1310
01:24:19,244 --> 01:24:22,282
Oh!

1311
01:24:22,282 --> 01:24:23,115
It's all right, keep going!

1312
01:24:23,115 --> 01:24:24,070
- Okay!
- I'm all right!

1313
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:02,160
- Hold it, wait!

1314
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:04,430
It's a laser fence!

1315
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:05,263
We're boxed in!

1316
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,254
Wait right here, just relax,

1317
01:25:09,254 --> 01:25:11,023
I'll see if I can find a way through it!

1318
01:25:38,828 --> 01:25:41,828
- Hey you're running over my friend.

1319
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:45,453
Stand up!

1320
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:48,213
I said stand up!

1321
01:25:54,599 --> 01:25:58,610
Put your hands behind you, turn around!

1322
01:25:58,610 --> 01:25:59,893
Turn around!

1323
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:04,763
That's it, back up!

1324
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:10,074
- Okay sonny, nice and easy,
let go of the laser gun!

1325
01:26:10,074 --> 01:26:10,907
That's it!

1326
01:26:12,133 --> 01:26:14,593
Here Kal, take the gun!

1327
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:23,153
All right, down on your
knees, nice and slow.

1328
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:25,893
That's it, give me the rope.

1329
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,421
You got it on him?

1330
01:26:29,421 --> 01:26:33,671
Okay that's it behind your
back, that's a good boy.

1331
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:36,150
- I'm not gonna kill you.

1332
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:39,340
Your comrades will find you soon,

1333
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,793
and when they do I want you
to give them this message.

1334
01:26:44,197 --> 01:26:45,773
Do not hurt this Earth family!

1335
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:50,010
what they did for me they did
out of love and gratitude.

1336
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:57,710
If they broke any of your laws,
it was my doing, not theirs.

1337
01:27:09,799 --> 01:27:11,710
- And you won't be needing this anymore.

1338
01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:12,610
Come on, let's go.

1339
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,320
How's the leg?

1340
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,180
- I've been hurt worse.

1341
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:39,360
- Well it's gonna slow you down.

1342
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:42,790
Look, I'm gonna use myself as a decoy,

1343
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,650
that'll give you the
extra time you'll need.

1344
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:47,500
- I can't let you do
that, you may get shot.

1345
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:49,940
- Don't worry about me
Kal, I can take care

1346
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:51,313
of myself in these parts.

1347
01:27:55,246 --> 01:27:56,730
I wish I had all the time to tell you

1348
01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,697
how much you've come to mean to me son.

1349
01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:03,663
- And you to me.

1350
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:07,791
Janet.

1351
01:28:22,623 --> 01:28:24,360
- I'm going with Kalif!

1352
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:25,193
- No.

1353
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:28,757
Stay with your family.

1354
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:31,103
The children need you.

1355
01:28:31,103 --> 01:28:32,420
- But I--
- He's right Janet.

1356
01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:34,483
And it's too dangerous out there for you.

1357
01:29:13,594 --> 01:29:17,751
Now look, you go on back to the ranch now.

1358
01:29:17,751 --> 01:29:20,723
Come on, he'll be back, I know it.

1359
01:29:21,660 --> 01:29:24,556
As soon as there's peace
again he'll be back.

1360
01:29:24,556 --> 01:29:26,473
Come on, now go on now.

1361
01:29:28,389 --> 01:29:29,222
Hurry.
