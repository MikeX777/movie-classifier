1
00:00:20,764 --> 00:00:23,812
I'm working on an idea.

2
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,455
It's kind of a collage
where I play different roles.

3
00:00:30,494 --> 00:00:34,506
A bit like "Orlando".
Did you see the film with Tilda Swinton?

4
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:38,296
It's about breaking
loose from the roles we

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,071
enter and allow
ourselves to get trapped in.

6
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,030
Especially as a woman.

7
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:49,905
It's a ritual. You enter the roles,
cleanse yourself of them,

8
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:53,802
and transcend to a higher level
with more freedom,

9
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:58,679
where you're not as trapped
by these stereotypes.

10
00:00:58,718 --> 00:01:02,385
I'm working on a musical.

11
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:05,188
- Do you remember?
- Mm.

12
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,199
Yeah, you mentioned that.
Is it being made now?

13
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:12,868
- No, we're still in the idea phase.
- Right.

14
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:20,394
The idea is making a musical
about miners on Svalbard.

15
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:26,442
- A musical about miners on Svalbard?
- Yes. It sounds so cool.

16
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:30,167
Yes, really cool.
I've never heard of anything like it.

17
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:35,198
Anyhow,
I also want the extras to be filming.

18
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:43,396
The movie will be based on them
and the miners, played by actors.

19
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:45,450
Sort of.

20
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:50,558
You have one film set
with extras filming actors playing miners?

21
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:54,954
Right, but also the miners.

22
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:58,948
- Kind of meta?
- Yes, to put it mildly.

23
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:04,727
But eventually, the miners

24
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:09,354
start talking to the extras,

25
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:13,194
to find out which world
they're actually living in.

26
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,305
At which point they go on strike.

27
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:22,026
Because they want to talk
to the actual director, played by me.

28
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:24,004
Well, of course!

29
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:29,572
When I walk in,
they're surprised

30
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,545
by me having Down's syndrome,
and in a political sense...

31
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:40,420
- That's the idea, anyway.
- In which way is this political?

32
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:46,103
Because someone like me, with Down's
syndrome, can make a movie this good.

33
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:49,866
Cool.

34
00:02:49,905 --> 00:02:57,316
Eventually, there's a jacuzzi scene
where I walk in, arm in arm with these...

35
00:02:57,354 --> 00:03:00,407
You end up arm in arm
with the actors, in the jacuzzi?

36
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:06,954
We eventually finish the movie,
but then the actors want to...

37
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:10,871
They make intrigue
because they're falling for me.

38
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:16,689
- They all fall for you?
- Yes, which leads to a lot of intrigue.

39
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:22,487
Just make sure it doesn't end up
more self-centered than political.

40
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:27,383
- Yes, I want it mostly political.
- I agree.

41
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,990
Excuse me.

42
00:03:33,028 --> 00:03:35,121
I'm looking after a cat.

43
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,018
And I've become a little allergic.

44
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:48,522
Like when those Syrian refugees
came to Norway.

45
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,343
For two weeks,
it's all the rage on Facebook.

46
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:57,201
People wear yellow vests and celebrities
cook for them. Two weeks later, it's over.

47
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,716
- Right. Are we ready?
- Yes.

48
00:03:59,754 --> 00:04:01,866
Torvald! Torvald!

49
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:04,785
- Let's get moving.
- Lots of people?

50
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:09,662
Not bad. Could be more, though.
Fine-looking audience.

51
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,486
- All Norwegian?
- No, no.

52
00:04:11,524 --> 00:04:15,210
- This will be nice, don't you think?
- I hope so.

53
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:21,854
There we are. You're almost up.

54
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:27,940
- I have to get it done...
- There we are.

55
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:33,758
Welcome back to day two of the
Norwegian American Culture Festival.

56
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:39,268
I'm proud to introduce
"Three Colors of Ibsen".

57
00:04:39,306 --> 00:04:41,663
We would like to thank
the Embassy of Norway,

58
00:04:41,687 --> 00:04:44,068
Visit Norway and
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

59
00:04:49,847 --> 00:04:52,535
Peer, you are lying!

60
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:56,490
No, I am not.

61
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:23,255
Political change through hair, fluids,
skin, weight, smell, orifices

62
00:05:23,294 --> 00:05:28,209
and nooks,
not to mention oral communication.

63
00:05:28,247 --> 00:05:30,359
Our lips flutter.

64
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:37,674
A clear conceptual mentality flows
through humanity like a wildfire.

65
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,594
And there truly is a fire.

66
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:44,548
And something in the air suggests change,
awakening, or Armageddon.

67
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:54,033
There is something deceased about it.

68
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,822
Reminds me of ball flowers
the day after.

69
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:00,906
- Hi. Lars.
- Gritt.

70
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:04,535
Are you also in the program?

71
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:08,721
I went to school
with some of the people on stage now.

72
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,406
- I see. You're an actor?
- Not in that sense.

73
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:16,247
I see.

74
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:21,066
- What do you do?
- You don't know who I am?

75
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:24,917
Just kidding. I'm a rapper.

76
00:06:24,941 --> 00:06:28,650
- I make music.
- Right.

77
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,473
Sometimes I just read my lyrics aloud.

78
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:36,369
I've been living abroad for a while.
I guess that's why...

79
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:39,518
That's fine. Do you live here?

80
00:06:40,055 --> 00:06:42,302
No. I live in Oslo now.

81
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:48,926
So I'm just here as
the undercover support person for her.

82
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:51,556
You should not laugh at that.

83
00:06:51,594 --> 00:06:55,550
I mean, of course, when Torvald is
no longer as devoted to me as he is now.

84
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:58,545
When my dancing no longer brings him joy.

85
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:02,212
There are new diversity criteria
for cultural exchange.

86
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,167
So she was brought along
as an alibi of sorts for the theatre.

87
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:11,159
What does
an "undercover support person" do?

88
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:15,748
She, or Marte, that's her name, has
published a number of books, two books,

89
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:18,590
with the same publisher
as Karl Ove Knausgård.

90
00:07:18,628 --> 00:07:23,466
She's very capable, so she doesn't accept
that she needs a support person.

91
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:27,172
The theatre thinks so,
but they can't formally require it of her.

92
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,033
We need to clear this space
for the next guest.

93
00:07:30,071 --> 00:07:32,260
- Sorry...
- Anders, can I get you a coffee?

94
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:35,966
- That'd be great. Hi, Anders.
- Lars. A pleasure.

95
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,039
I watched your YouTube series...

96
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:40,919
- That went great!
- Hi, Anders!

97
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:44,433
- So good to see you.
- You too. Well done!

98
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:46,718
- Hi there!
- Fancy meeting you here!

99
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:51,268
Can I get you anything?

100
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:53,956
- You made a movie?
- An adaptation of Spring.

101
00:07:53,994 --> 00:07:56,894
- Have you met Marte?
- Hi! Anders T. Andersen. A pleasure.

102
00:07:56,932 --> 00:08:00,042
- Marte was just on stage.
- Hi there!

103
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:03,940
- Mattis Hermann Nyquist!
- How are you?

104
00:08:03,978 --> 00:08:08,586
- Petronella! I'll say.
- Straight from LA?

105
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:15,383
We've actually been in LA...
We take an associative approach, so we...

106
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:18,069
Crazy to give himself
the leading part.

107
00:08:18,093 --> 00:08:20,951
Is that a personality
trait that's not quite...

108
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,828
I did so many test shoots in those days.
I remember our talks, you said:

109
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:32,414
"Stop caring about what you believe
the casting agent wants. Do your thing!"

110
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:34,526
I said that?

111
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:37,559
He's gotten old.
Still handsome, though.

112
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:41,438
- Pity he's not staying in our hotel.
- Do you know where he's staying?

113
00:08:41,975 --> 00:08:47,966
I actually prefer Jo Nesbø.
He's so rough and rugged.

114
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:51,652
- And his books are so cool.
- Right.

115
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,511
Karl-Ove is more a man of today,
in my opinion.

116
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,311
Lars Vaular has written a commission work:
"The Lord's Henchmen".

117
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,054
Look into your innermost self.
Don't search. Just find.

118
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:11,025
Let the right come in.
Whatever it is, it will turn out to be.

119
00:09:11,063 --> 00:09:13,770
We are difficult to love.

120
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:17,918
- No more spray.
- Just a little. Get your crew cut going.

121
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:22,718
- Aren't you going out?
- I'm cool enough as I am.

122
00:09:23,236 --> 00:09:29,150
I guess you'll be hanging out with Mattis
and those guys again tonight?

123
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:33,930
I thought I'd give you some time off,
and have a look around

124
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:36,646
while you're hanging
out with the actors.

125
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,634
Sounds good. We'll text later.

126
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:42,436
So what you're saying,
is that having money is good. Why film?

127
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:45,476
I read an early essay
by Knausgård where he

128
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,388
claims that literature
is the only medium

129
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:54,244
with the potential of accurately
describing the processes of the soul.

130
00:09:54,282 --> 00:09:56,318
And I wanted to challenge that.

131
00:09:56,836 --> 00:10:03,575
We have to also be mindful
of not becoming too navlebeskuende.

132
00:10:03,614 --> 00:10:07,799
Of becoming too egocentric
about ourselves as creators.

133
00:10:35,255 --> 00:10:38,442
- Did you ever had your cards read before?
- No.

134
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:41,246
Don't be scared.

135
00:10:49,828 --> 00:10:53,630
This looks bad, and...

136
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:57,662
It is, and it isn't.
Essentially the Tower...

137
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,308
With the way I like to interpret
this card, is that it means that

138
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:07,089
you have needed to make a big decision
in your life that you're ignoring.

139
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:11,946
Which means, you know... If the Tower's
on fire, people have to jump out.

140
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:14,770
You don't have a choice
any more. You have

141
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:17,668
to move forward
whether you like it or not.

142
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:22,372
This is clearly how you feel about it,
which is very trapped.

143
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,254
You're not able to see the way out.

144
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:27,917
You need to pay
attention to what you really

145
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:31,185
want, who you are,
to get through this.

146
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:36,849
Because this is gonna happen whether you
like it or not. It's already happening.

147
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:41,591
Pull three pieces out of here.

148
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:50,500
It's a crow's foot. It's about omens,
about paying attention to messages.

149
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:56,894
Your foremothers are trying to give you
messages, and you're not paying attention.

150
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:02,001
Stand over here with
your arms stretched out.

151
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,008
This is sage. It's used
to remove negativity

152
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:07,492
out of the space
and off the person.

153
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,698
For those of you who haven't done it,
maybe watch the pairs that have.

154
00:12:35,236 --> 00:12:41,226
If you guys line up this way...
And be careful for... Just watch for now.

155
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:51,844
- Can you face this way, Fabian?
- Yeah.

156
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:57,642
Now you are the shooter, J.P.
Bang!

157
00:12:59,505 --> 00:13:01,463
Follow him all the way down.

158
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:10,833
Come here!

159
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:15,038
Will you help me stop this?

160
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:17,649
Sure.

161
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:20,663
And switch.

162
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:29,438
Holy hand.

163
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,990
Holy heart.

164
00:13:33,028 --> 00:13:35,754
Holy face.

165
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,126
- Okay, good! Thank you!
- Hi.

166
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:59,850
- Thank you for happening to be here.
- Thank you.

167
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:05,406
As you can see, we hope that somebody
helps us stop this violent cycle.

168
00:14:05,431 --> 00:14:07,480
- It's the whole point of the piece.
- Yeah. Right.

169
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:10,487
That gives a lot of meaning.

170
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:17,226
It's very serendipitous that you're here. We
need to rehearse with actual participants.

171
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:18,414
Yeah, that's cool.

172
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:21,278
Our company is called
"The Living Theatre".

173
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:25,118
- Really?
- Yeah. We're a very old theatre company.

174
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:31,473
- Like the old Living Theatre? That's you?
- That's us. It's still living!

175
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:35,639
This piece here
is called "Apokatastasis".

176
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:38,446
We're rehearsing to
go to this festival this summer

177
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,073
called "Burning Man"
out in the desert.

178
00:14:41,111 --> 00:14:45,066
Okay! Burning Man? Cool.

179
00:14:45,105 --> 00:14:49,041
I was 21 and looking
at the section "gigs".

180
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,675
I've been to the
gigs section as well.

181
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:54,647
They're mostly porn,
adult film, auditions.

182
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:59,524
I was scrolling through, and saw something
that said "The Living Theatre".

183
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:05,111
Really shitty porn production company
name, so it must be a real theatre.

184
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,364
It brought me to this
essay that Judith had

185
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:11,774
written with red letters
on black background:

186
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:19,454
"There are structures in our mind
that create the systems in society."

187
00:15:19,492 --> 00:15:22,545
"And it's our job as artists
to break the structures of the mind

188
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:26,462
- to break the systems in society."
- Wow. That's so profound.

189
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,380
THE WHITE INFLAMMATION

190
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,767
What are you up to now, Gry-Jeanette?
Or Gritt?

191
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:07,511
Now I'm working on a ritual.

192
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,562
The aim is to give
the paradigm shift we're facing a boost.

193
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:16,266
To bury the patriarchy and capitalism.
And it will culminate in

194
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:21,815
a human chain around the Oslofjord,
everybody dressed in white, holding hands.

195
00:16:21,854 --> 00:16:25,866
I want to visualize
the inflammation in our society.

196
00:16:25,905 --> 00:16:29,726
The Arts Council is processing
my application right now, so...

197
00:16:29,764 --> 00:16:31,761
That's nice.

198
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:10,007
As I was going down impassive Rivers,

199
00:17:10,046 --> 00:17:14,078
I no longer felt myself guided by haulers:

200
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:17,802
Yelping redskins had taken them as targets

201
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:22,410
And had nailed them naked
to colored stakes

202
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:26,366
The bearer of Flemish wheat
or English cottons,

203
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:30,033
I was indifferent to all crews

204
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:34,775
When with my haulers
this uproar stopped

205
00:17:34,814 --> 00:17:38,596
The Rivers let me go where I wanted

206
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:45,450
To Rimbaud, art was but a means. He wanted
to access something far more violent:

207
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:47,678
The poem that is life itself.

208
00:17:48,196 --> 00:17:50,914
Most are content
with being artists and

209
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:54,090
cultural workers - life
in that comfort zone.

210
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:59,889
But I think Rimbaud wanted out, and into
something far more dangerous: life itself.

211
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:09,316
There you are!
Hi there, Peaches!

212
00:18:17,956 --> 00:18:21,143
- Hi there!
- She's been staying at a hotel.

213
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:24,042
- This looks so cool.
- Yeah, it's really nice.

214
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:28,574
Many have heard about it, but it's
too small for most. The body is so short.

215
00:18:33,316 --> 00:18:36,561
Want to go out on the balcony?

216
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:50,423
Unknown material released
when a majority of imaginations meet

217
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:53,150
and conjure up something more.

218
00:19:53,188 --> 00:19:57,278
A third voice or body.

219
00:19:57,815 --> 00:20:01,339
I wonder if one,
as an individual, only has

220
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:04,670
access to the unknown
through intuition.

221
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,434
Which, as we know,
is rarely used these days.

222
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:11,447
Simply because no one knows
how to deal with an almost liquid notion.

223
00:20:11,486 --> 00:20:15,422
Those cherries...
Were they discontinued?

224
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,340
I think so, if we don't have them.

225
00:20:27,998 --> 00:20:32,798
- I think I'm in a fiction in my life.
- You're in a fiction?

226
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,599
I think I'm in a fiction.
Alone in my fear.

227
00:20:36,638 --> 00:20:40,382
I hurt alone. Not good.

228
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,321
- Want it?
- No, go ahead.

229
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:45,124
But you see, I can't really...

230
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,634
GRANT LIST Ministry of Culture

231
00:21:15,912 --> 00:21:20,463
- The Arts Council, hello.
- Hello. My name is Gritt Dahl.

232
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:23,277
I sent in an application
for the performance

233
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:25,416
project "The White
Inflammation".

234
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:28,508
Could you give me the
grounds for rejection?

235
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:32,962
- Would you like to submit a complaint?
- No. Just the grounds.

236
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,551
That can be done,
but you will have to file

237
00:21:35,575 --> 00:21:37,916
an application. Please
state your name.

238
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:41,564
Gry-Jeanette Dahl.- Dahl...

239
00:21:42,773 --> 00:21:45,519
- Oh, but there was no rejection.
- What?

240
00:21:45,557 --> 00:21:49,378
- The application was not accepted.
- What?

241
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:55,215
Let's see. Looking at your CV now.
Formal education is not a requirement,

242
00:21:55,253 --> 00:21:59,055
but must be compensated for
by adequate production experience.

243
00:21:59,093 --> 00:22:01,839
But...

244
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:06,562
Sorry, I have to...

245
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:29,621
I'm not looking to get huge muscles.

246
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,653
Just strength, in general.

247
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:36,591
You're in safe hands.

248
00:22:41,352 --> 00:22:43,311
Strength...

249
00:22:44,252 --> 00:22:48,725
Kick upwards. One, two...

250
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,525
This is easy enough.

251
00:22:53,564 --> 00:22:55,868
Push them together.

252
00:22:58,364 --> 00:23:01,320
- How many kilos?
- Just four.

253
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,237
Mental health is a big part of it.

254
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:10,882
I see that in all the people
I have trained for years.

255
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,740
- That you grow stronger mentally?
- Let me show you.

256
00:23:15,778 --> 00:23:17,660
It's that part.

257
00:23:19,503 --> 00:23:21,788
What do you do?

258
00:23:22,306 --> 00:23:27,202
I'm an artist.
I work on developing rituals.

259
00:23:29,295 --> 00:23:32,148
Right now I have a
pretty big project. It'll

260
00:23:32,172 --> 00:23:34,920
be a collective ritual
for the whole city.

261
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:39,816
If that's what you enjoy doing,
then that's great.

262
00:23:39,855 --> 00:23:41,871
Is it going ok?

263
00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:46,748
My support network is somewhat lacking.

264
00:23:47,285 --> 00:23:54,293
You have to file applications
to the Arts Council.

265
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:58,824
The thing is,
they didn't accept my application.

266
00:23:58,863 --> 00:24:02,664
They told me
I did not qualify as an applicant.

267
00:24:02,703 --> 00:24:07,676
- So you were rejected?
- In a way, yes.

268
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:11,439
But, dear... There are...

269
00:24:11,477 --> 00:24:15,413
There are much worse fates.

270
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:19,004
So you got one rejection.
So what?

271
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,810
We live in the best country in the world.

272
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:23,016
Yes.

273
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:27,797
I'm not the one saying that.
The UN says that. Don't give up!

274
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:33,461
They're so rigid.
It's all about pigeonholing people.

275
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,514
- The Ministry of Culture...
- Such a shitty department.

276
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:38,511
You need to go knocking on their door.

277
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:44,252
Maybe it was a bit too ambitious.
It was a massive project.

278
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,842
With a large budget.
Maybe they...

279
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:52,565
That chapter ends now.
Let's work out and strengthen you,

280
00:24:52,604 --> 00:24:56,655
- both physically and mentally.
- All right.

281
00:24:56,693 --> 00:25:00,591
Listen, life is fleeting.

282
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:05,218
It will come to an end.
Why spend time being disappointed?

283
00:25:05,256 --> 00:25:09,308
Right, and what he sings about
is exactly what happened to you.

284
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,508
Hi. I've come to see Lars Øyno,
at the Theatre of Cruelty.

285
00:25:55,176 --> 00:25:57,231
Hi! I was recently in New York.

286
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:00,898
I saw The Living Theatre.
Brad says hi.

287
00:26:00,936 --> 00:26:06,620
- Brad Burgess. Do you have a moment?
- Sure.

288
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:08,655
Thank you so much.

289
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:14,588
I saw Amazonas here a few days ago,
and I must say, that was very inspiring.

290
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,159
I especially liked
the plastic bag being folded.

291
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:21,999
- Right. The lady in the opening scene.
- Yeah.

292
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:30,562
The way that sequence lingered. The
estrangement of something so trivial...

293
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,540
It's from Poland.

294
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,319
The piece is about Poland
after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

295
00:26:38,357 --> 00:26:41,218
Before 1990, before the fall,

296
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:48,168
elderly women often sold plastic bags
from the West on the black markets.

297
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:52,028
They sat there folding them
to make them look nice enough to sell.

298
00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:54,773
We throw plastic bags away.
They're worthless to us.

299
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:58,575
But she gives it focus, and cares about
that which we throw away.

300
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:01,271
Suddenly a plastic
bag turns into something

301
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:03,490
very... People
get to see what is.

302
00:27:03,528 --> 00:27:05,986
- Or see what isn't.
- Yeah?

303
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,981
It's alchemy.

304
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:13,858
That's some of the reason
why I'm here now.

305
00:27:13,896 --> 00:27:16,642
I'm a performance artist myself,

306
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,712
but I never went to the arts academy,
like most do.

307
00:27:20,751 --> 00:27:27,279
I went from Romerike drama school to LA,
and stayed there for a while.

308
00:27:27,317 --> 00:27:31,272
Then I made some contacts in Berlin,
and went a bit back and forth.

309
00:27:31,311 --> 00:27:37,685
But for the most part I've worked with
an independent theater group in Aalborg.

310
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:41,621
- They worked more devised. You know.
- Right.

311
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,828
And what I'm doing now, in few words,

312
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:52,200
is a project that is more like a ritual.
Which in a way...

313
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:57,308
I use this expression that I've coined
"The White Inflammation".

314
00:27:57,826 --> 00:28:01,032
Which I believe
covers Scandinavia like a veil.

315
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:05,640
Like a numbness. A drug, almost.

316
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,536
An apathy, an inability to act,
a comfort that...

317
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:14,549
In Artaud's book
"The Theatre and its Double", he tells us

318
00:28:14,588 --> 00:28:19,330
that to Asians, the color white
is synonymous with decomposition.

319
00:28:19,368 --> 00:28:21,192
- Right!
- Plague.

320
00:28:21,231 --> 00:28:24,015
Plague.
Well, that makes perfect sense.

321
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:31,695
The paradigm shift we're currently facing,
the inevitable change, can be...

322
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:37,263
We may experience an instinctive fear
and aversion, but what if we rather...

323
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:40,014
I attempt to create
a ritual through which

324
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:42,965
we instead embrace it,
and enter it together.

325
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:46,037
And that's what brought me here.

326
00:28:46,076 --> 00:28:52,661
Maybe that's something
you could be interested in producing?

327
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:59,535
Sorry, but I don't produce for others.
I have more than enough with my own.

328
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:03,548
I totally get that,
but most of the work is done.

329
00:29:04,085 --> 00:29:08,271
It's purely a formality,
with regards to the Arts Council.

330
00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:15,068
I will do all the work,
but they're a bit rigid with formalities.

331
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:25,205
For that matter,
it could also be worthwhile to me

332
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:30,216
to get insight into your processes,
and how you...

333
00:29:30,255 --> 00:29:37,148
So if you need help with anything here,
I could always...

334
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:58,018
Guys, this is Gritt. She's a performance
artist with ties to The Living.

335
00:29:58,056 --> 00:30:00,764
She'll be helping us
throughout the play period.

336
00:30:00,802 --> 00:30:02,799
THE CRUELTY

337
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:15,221
- We've got it now.
- Wine? That's rare!

338
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,925
- Was it that good?
- Not that it was that good...

339
00:30:19,964 --> 00:30:22,997
- Oh. Thank you!
- To you too.

340
00:30:23,036 --> 00:30:24,936
How nice of you.

341
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:27,778
We don't need to be so quiet
by the plastic bag.

342
00:30:27,816 --> 00:30:32,482
It's almost like the actor
is overcome with the silence.

343
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,708
Like they feel the need
to work quietly with the bag.

344
00:30:36,226 --> 00:30:41,256
That's not necessary. You can counteract
the silence by folding the bag vigorously.

345
00:30:41,295 --> 00:30:44,309
You can mix it up.
Meticulous at first, but then...

346
00:30:44,348 --> 00:30:48,840
This is anonymous.
No actors are on display.

347
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:53,813
We need to check
if there even are any actors down here.

348
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,365
And that is interesting.
Such plays are rare indeed,

349
00:30:57,404 --> 00:31:03,164
where you must actively look
to see if this is an actual act.

350
00:31:03,202 --> 00:31:07,925
Normally, the actors would display
themselves. But that's not the case here.

351
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:12,168
People wonder
why they keep doing this.

352
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:16,584
The sheer infantility
will wear the audience out.

353
00:31:16,623 --> 00:31:20,655
It seems so fucking awful
that it becomes kind of a...

354
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:24,514
But when it goes over the edge,
it may get interesting.

355
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:27,509
Because you don't see adults
do those things.

356
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:57,020
Oh God.

357
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:00,744
Hi there.

358
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,736
Oh!

359
00:32:13,378 --> 00:32:16,066
- Hi.
- Hi.

360
00:32:17,084 --> 00:32:22,248
- You've been traveling all night?
- 21 hours in total.

361
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:28,776
Everything went well.
I put him out here.

362
00:32:31,772 --> 00:32:37,493
- Hi there, Peaches!
- Look who's home!

363
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:43,906
- You're allergic to Peaches!
- No, no. It's just...

364
00:32:43,944 --> 00:32:47,823
- Yes. You're a bit red.
- I have a cold coming on.

365
00:32:47,861 --> 00:32:51,010
If everything goes according to plan,

366
00:32:51,068 --> 00:32:54,543
there will be a Waldorf school
in Senegal by next year.

367
00:32:54,581 --> 00:32:58,383
- Then it'll be there.
- Right. That's fantastic.

368
00:32:58,421 --> 00:33:03,221
Yes! That thing with you and the
Theatre of Cruelty is fantastic too.

369
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,140
Yes? It's just one
of many things right now.

370
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:09,116
But I do think Lars is great.

371
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:14,837
We share so many... Well, what he's doing
is much more uncompromising.

372
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:21,557
- But I am familiar with...
- Oh right, I have something in my bag.

373
00:33:21,596 --> 00:33:23,708
- Oh! What?
- Here you go!

374
00:33:24,226 --> 00:33:30,082
An eight-year-old boy made it.
Listen, there's this grainy sound.

375
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,348
- Yeah, I hear it.
- So that it won't sound too pretty.

376
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:38,626
So it's kind of like
a stone in your shoe...

377
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:43,791
I guess I should get going.

378
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:46,728
I'll pack this down.

379
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:58,114
- Thank you so much!
- No, thank you. This is win-win.

380
00:33:58,152 --> 00:34:05,621
- And you'll be going back...
- You know... Week 50 or so.

381
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,554
If you need some time to yourself,
the cabin is just standing there.

382
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:13,589
Right!

383
00:34:13,628 --> 00:34:15,548
Let me just...

384
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:17,525
Goodbye, then.

385
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:21,999
So long,
and good luck on your final exam!

386
00:34:48,783 --> 00:34:52,661
- Hi! Nice to see you.
- Yes.

387
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,754
- Very nice.
- You're coming from...

388
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:59,420
- Both guitar and ...?
- Ukulele and acoustic guitar.

389
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:04,104
Lots of luggage?
Want a hand with that?

390
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:08,060
No, that's all right.
Just a few costumes, and...

391
00:35:08,098 --> 00:35:11,074
- Want to see what my place is like?
- Yes.

392
00:35:24,399 --> 00:35:27,356
Who are you considering for your cast?

393
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:33,922
I've been considering Mikkel Gaup.
He's one of my favorites.

394
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,722
Henrik Mestad. Thorbjørn Harr.
Kristofer Hivju.

395
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,580
Wouldn't it be nice to have someone
with more feminine sides?

396
00:35:43,618 --> 00:35:45,557
Maybe Lars Vaular, or...

397
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:49,512
- They're supposed to be miners.
- What about Trine Wiggen?

398
00:35:49,551 --> 00:35:54,351
Trine Wiggen is part
of another project of mine.

399
00:35:54,408 --> 00:35:57,903
I'm so sick
of how society just sees...

400
00:35:59,151 --> 00:36:04,796
my syndrome, and not what I'm capable of.
I'd like to see a therapist.

401
00:36:04,834 --> 00:36:07,637
I've never gone to a therapist before.

402
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:14,338
So why not see a therapist on stage,
to mirror society?

403
00:36:14,376 --> 00:36:20,175
That's what I was thinking, anyway.
Vent out all my frustration.

404
00:36:20,213 --> 00:36:24,764
Then it will look like
you see a therapist to...

405
00:36:24,802 --> 00:36:27,951
They want to label me, in a way.

406
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:31,676
Just like they do with cows.

407
00:36:31,714 --> 00:36:34,556
They get ear tags,
I got mine when I was born.

408
00:36:34,594 --> 00:36:37,436
I couldn't agree more.

409
00:36:37,474 --> 00:36:43,292
But why should the responsibility,
or the blame, be placed on the individual?

410
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,920
- Society is scared.
- Right!

411
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:51,874
That's what my "White Inflammation"
is all about too.

412
00:36:56,597 --> 00:36:57,768
Hello?

413
00:36:59,324 --> 00:37:01,244
Hi.

414
00:37:02,434 --> 00:37:05,045
Cool! I'm so on board.

415
00:37:07,004 --> 00:37:10,978
Yes, we will. Bye.

416
00:37:11,784 --> 00:37:14,108
I thought it was the fire alarm.

417
00:37:14,626 --> 00:37:19,522
I want to become less scared of the fire
alarm. So I'm practicing with my phone.

418
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,498
Smart! Who was that?

419
00:37:22,536 --> 00:37:27,279
That was Anders T. Andersen.
He wants to help me with my miner play.

420
00:37:27,317 --> 00:37:31,234
But...
Where do you know him from?

421
00:37:31,272 --> 00:37:34,152
I met him in NYC,
when we were there together.

422
00:37:34,191 --> 00:37:37,743
He knows what I'm capable of,
to put it that way.

423
00:37:37,781 --> 00:37:41,813
- Which is not the case with everybody.
- Do you trust him enough to...

424
00:37:41,852 --> 00:37:46,325
Yes, I do.

425
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:51,413
It's just so important to pick someone
with the right outlook on humanity.

426
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:56,060
- To have good values when you...
- I get that.

427
00:37:56,098 --> 00:38:01,052
- What about royalties?
- What does that mean?

428
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:05,621
You know... Rights.

429
00:38:20,328 --> 00:38:22,959
Not the best view on women...

430
00:38:22,997 --> 00:38:27,068
What do you mean by that?

431
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:34,364
- No female drivers, for instance.
- It's just a movie.

432
00:38:34,402 --> 00:38:38,338
Fine, it's entertainment,
but this is just so...

433
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:46,268
far out! You're usually
so politically aware, Marte.

434
00:38:46,786 --> 00:38:49,973
I'm just trying to enjoy this movie.

435
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:51,836
Oh well...

436
00:38:52,949 --> 00:38:54,908
Sorry.

437
00:39:02,453 --> 00:39:07,004
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Good.

438
00:39:14,031 --> 00:39:15,797
I'll go brush my teeth.

439
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,708
A will to replace or redefine the role

440
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:29,122
of body and art
in social, cultural and political life.

441
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,191
And a will to imagine and manage change
as a profound potential,

442
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:37,685
based on a corporeal perspective.

443
00:39:38,031 --> 00:39:44,444
We need singular voices who remind us
of the strangeness of being alive.

444
00:39:45,538 --> 00:39:48,629
Profound, beautiful and hideous

445
00:39:48,668 --> 00:39:53,986
and food and the earth we keep beneath us,
or rise above.

446
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:58,056
Because there are questions
we are born to struggle with.

447
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:04,642
Questions involving "why" and "for what".

448
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:07,868
Back by the watering hole stands a body,

449
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:12,418
observing something else,
as the aftermath of a past fire.

450
00:40:12,456 --> 00:40:16,488
It wonders how to unite all of this.

451
00:40:34,709 --> 00:40:39,548
- Would you like some help with that?
- Do you need a ticket?

452
00:40:40,085 --> 00:40:43,176
- To get in? Yes.
- Okay.

453
00:41:59,036 --> 00:42:01,032
Oh, sorry!

454
00:42:02,012 --> 00:42:03,874
Did it go well?

455
00:42:28,988 --> 00:42:32,520
Gritt?
Let's have a coffee up here.

456
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:36,591
Okay.

457
00:42:38,511 --> 00:42:41,084
Are you living in the theatre, Gritt?

458
00:42:41,122 --> 00:42:44,117
What? If I'm living here?

459
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:49,858
I lived at my aunt's place
while she was in Senegal.

460
00:42:49,896 --> 00:42:55,522
She came back early,
and I didn't have the time to...

461
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:59,439
I couldn't find another place,
or didn't have the time...

462
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:02,319
She's going back, so then...

463
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:06,332
I do have other options.
This was just the most convenient.

464
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:10,805
That's all right, Gritt.
But you need to tell me.

465
00:43:10,844 --> 00:43:14,684
Of course. I'm sorry.

466
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,988
I have a proposition.

467
00:43:17,506 --> 00:43:24,514
You stay here, and I will get you some
work, to help you get back on your feet.

468
00:43:27,221 --> 00:43:30,965
My next project is about the abject.

469
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,072
That which is cast aside. I'm in touch
with a refugee center for research.

470
00:43:36,111 --> 00:43:40,968
If you could help them film their
everyday life, that would be a great help.

471
00:43:51,471 --> 00:43:54,063
Like art?

472
00:43:54,101 --> 00:43:57,960
I want to collect
a group of people from here.

473
00:43:57,999 --> 00:43:59,996
- Like us, for example?
- For example.

474
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:02,664
And...

475
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:08,616
Hi, Ragnhild!
Ragnhild is an artist and volunteer.

476
00:44:08,655 --> 00:44:10,613
- Gritt Dahl. Hi.
- Hi.

477
00:44:10,652 --> 00:44:17,045
I'm coming from the Theatre of Cruelty.
We have a project about the castaways.

478
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:21,077
What kind of contribution
did you have in mind for this place?

479
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:25,820
Well, this is more like research
for a play.

480
00:44:25,858 --> 00:44:32,444
My plan was to gather a group,
and let them

481
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:35,612
- film their everyday life.
- Wow! Did you hear?

482
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:39,356
- Many here dream of becoming actors.
- Right?

483
00:44:40,373 --> 00:44:45,999
Our main goal is
getting a visual insight.

484
00:44:46,037 --> 00:44:49,858
Hollywood next!

485
00:44:52,968 --> 00:44:57,365
- Such a nice project!
- It's very nice.

486
00:44:58,556 --> 00:45:01,493
You're not sure?
Who lives in here?

487
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:05,026
Nobody? Oh, that's a window?

488
00:45:05,064 --> 00:45:07,964
Now you can get into the house.
That's good.

489
00:45:08,002 --> 00:45:11,938
- Look at that! You're at it too!
- Yeah...

490
00:45:14,972 --> 00:45:17,775
Jéro Yun and I
had never heard of each other

491
00:45:17,813 --> 00:45:21,346
before being brought together
by Copenhagen LAB.

492
00:45:21,384 --> 00:45:25,282
There we were curated together
based on our resumes.

493
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:31,388
We agreed that we didn't want to meet
halfway between fiction and documentary.

494
00:45:31,925 --> 00:45:34,248
He would film his breakfast,
and I would film mine.

495
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:37,653
We didn't have much
in the way of thematics

496
00:45:37,677 --> 00:45:40,700
before we started. It
came from the material.

497
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:18,255
MY DEAR PEACHES
PASSED AWAY LAST NIGHT.

498
00:46:18,293 --> 00:46:19,293
Peaches...

499
00:46:26,818 --> 00:46:31,464
WHO SHOULD I USE TO SELL MY FLAT?
AFRICALOVE, HERE I COME!

500
00:46:31,503 --> 00:46:35,592
Auntie Rakel... What's going on?

501
00:46:36,476 --> 00:46:37,532
Oh no...

502
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:47,036
The burden of living through history.

503
00:46:48,015 --> 00:46:53,564
Maybe through eternity,
and the love for the Earth itself.

504
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:58,344
It can be hard to cling on to
what we perceive as real.

505
00:46:58,383 --> 00:47:02,300
Tables and chairs
with friends or acquaintances.

506
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:05,064
It's hard to not just float away,

507
00:47:05,103 --> 00:47:09,192
instead of staying on in this world
among concepts and melancholy

508
00:47:09,231 --> 00:47:12,188
without falling into nihilism or apathy.

509
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:14,818
Right, let's...

510
00:47:14,856 --> 00:47:17,775
Are the others coming?

511
00:47:22,498 --> 00:47:26,074
Nour is at the
Directorate of Immigration.

512
00:47:26,098 --> 00:47:27,298
Okay?

513
00:47:27,336 --> 00:47:32,021
And he doesn't know about Serwan.

514
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,957
A couple of the others
are getting sent back to Germany.

515
00:47:39,778 --> 00:47:44,808
- He said that I'm filming a lot.
- Yes. That's great.

516
00:47:45,788 --> 00:47:48,264
"How to connect to ..."

517
00:47:50,511 --> 00:47:53,314
- It's working.
- Yeah.

518
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:04,565
- Wood... No.
- Flower?

519
00:48:04,604 --> 00:48:07,541
Wood flower?

520
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:08,789
No, wood anemone!

521
00:48:08,828 --> 00:48:11,708
Then I don't know where resources
and perfect life would be.

522
00:48:12,245 --> 00:48:14,660
Is it acknowledgment
in terms of "I get paid

523
00:48:14,684 --> 00:48:17,122
for what I can",
or is it getting respected?

524
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:21,903
Maybe perfect life is the complete harmony
of everything. It's in the center.

525
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:26,626
Something like self-development
is about my thoughts and me personally.

526
00:48:26,664 --> 00:48:29,602
Same thing about my passion
and my life experience.

527
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,791
Maybe life experience
is somewhere in between.

528
00:48:51,644 --> 00:48:54,716
- Where are you headed?
- Where's my bike?

529
00:49:10,037 --> 00:49:13,877
- He said: "That's our life."
- Yes.

530
00:49:13,935 --> 00:49:15,874
How did you say it?

531
00:49:33,308 --> 00:49:37,403
These moments fall
upon us where through

532
00:49:37,427 --> 00:49:41,948
unusual happenings
we suddenly share vision.

533
00:49:43,695 --> 00:49:47,708
Something clicks into place.
It's an almost physical sensation.

534
00:49:48,226 --> 00:49:49,570
It's not just a metaphor.

535
00:49:49,608 --> 00:49:54,984
It's an actual sensation, like falling
down the stairs or dropping a mug,

536
00:49:55,023 --> 00:49:57,000
that we somehow refuse to...

537
00:49:57,039 --> 00:49:59,842
Hey! Excuse me!

538
00:49:59,919 --> 00:50:02,799
Food waste goes in the other trash can.

539
00:50:02,856 --> 00:50:06,716
- Oh, it's not... Never mind.
- This?

540
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:10,652
Normally, we put it in the other can.
But I can't see it right now.

541
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:15,125
- Oh, okay.
- I guess you can just throw it in there.

542
00:50:15,164 --> 00:50:18,159
Yeah, I guess so.

543
00:50:21,135 --> 00:50:24,725
It's a mix of the given
things in nature...

544
00:50:24,749 --> 00:50:25,954
The rain.

545
00:50:25,992 --> 00:50:28,584
The rain, the wind...

546
00:50:28,623 --> 00:50:30,600
Nature, and that which...

547
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:34,077
A third voice or entity,

548
00:50:34,104 --> 00:50:38,580
where two playful, frolicsome humans
through deep listening

549
00:50:38,605 --> 00:50:42,135
manage to share enough of themselves
to build something new.

550
00:50:42,778 --> 00:50:48,719
You raise a building.
The material is complex, yet open enough

551
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:51,175
for an almost
new place to be localized.

552
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,533
THE ABJECT
That which is cast aside

553
00:50:53,698 --> 00:50:57,423
Give them to Gritt,
so that she can give it to Thomas.

554
00:50:57,461 --> 00:51:02,204
So that Thomas has them
by the make-up table.

555
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:07,349
You need to be there two hours
before departure. What do you think?

556
00:51:07,388 --> 00:51:11,208
- No more than 20.
- No more than 22?

557
00:51:11,746 --> 00:51:16,796
- No, 16-18. Won't you bring the posters?
- We'll leave them here.

558
00:51:16,834 --> 00:51:19,752
- Do you have more in Tokyo?
- We'll get them made.

559
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:23,535
- You'll be staying here, then?
- Yes.

560
00:51:23,592 --> 00:51:28,066
This is a good room to stay in.

561
00:52:13,436 --> 00:52:19,119
I feel like this room has the right
atmosphere for our stories to be shared.

562
00:52:21,231 --> 00:52:24,706
Lars Øyno, of course,
has his project.

563
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:28,796
But this is something else.

564
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,634
We will make this play rather fast.

565
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:39,298
And the result
does not have to resemble

566
00:52:39,336 --> 00:52:44,098
any classical play
you could watch at our national theatre.

567
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:59,266
This will be authentic,
documentary...

568
00:52:59,304 --> 00:53:00,304
This will be you.

569
00:53:02,184 --> 00:53:08,117
Which is Lars' focus too,
with his theme The Abject,

570
00:53:09,116 --> 00:53:11,784
which in turn was the basis for this.

571
00:53:11,823 --> 00:53:18,543
What I thought we'd focus on,
is that feeling

572
00:53:18,581 --> 00:53:23,631
of what it does to a person
to be in this kind of situation

573
00:53:23,669 --> 00:53:27,548
To be in a country
where you don't truly belong.

574
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:35,765
I'm from a village in the north of Syria.

575
00:53:37,032 --> 00:53:39,893
My family they love football.

576
00:53:39,932 --> 00:53:43,522
In my village we had one football.

577
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,343
My football.

578
00:53:47,381 --> 00:53:53,084
Why could you not just keep on
playing football and living your life?

579
00:53:53,122 --> 00:53:55,292
I was shot.

580
00:54:05,506 --> 00:54:09,423
- Isis.
- Did they gun down the entire village?

581
00:54:09,461 --> 00:54:11,592
Yes.

582
00:54:12,456 --> 00:54:15,317
They stole my dream...

583
00:54:16,162 --> 00:54:18,274
My girlfriend...

584
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:28,796
I didn't want to join the army.

585
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:31,522
I had almost...

586
00:54:32,751 --> 00:54:35,612
I was so scared when I crossed the border.

587
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:40,143
The Turkish soldiers would start firing
if we didn't stop.

588
00:54:40,181 --> 00:54:44,866
They would fire at will, anywhere.

589
00:54:46,018 --> 00:54:50,722
I had to run to the other side.

590
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:55,810
All of you have voices that fit well.

591
00:54:55,848 --> 00:55:03,528
With theatre, it's important that your
voice reach all the way to the back rows.

592
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:20,828
He had just finished
his teacher training.

593
00:55:21,346 --> 00:55:25,282
He was about to start teaching,
but what happened?

594
00:55:29,084 --> 00:55:34,018
He had to move to Turkey
since he didn't want to join the army.

595
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,949
And now we're here.

596
00:55:42,812 --> 00:55:45,346
All right.

597
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:53,180
I worked with this phrase
called "The White Inflammation".

598
00:55:53,218 --> 00:55:57,039
That focuses on kind of a poison

599
00:55:57,077 --> 00:56:01,896
that lays all over Scandinavia,
maybe all over the West.

600
00:56:01,935 --> 00:56:06,831
Those "tunnels" - job, family...

601
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:14,204
I feel we have to...
And there is...

602
00:56:14,242 --> 00:56:17,295
That's where we come in
with our play.

603
00:56:40,124 --> 00:56:43,388
- Please take off your shoes.
- Oh. Sorry.

604
00:56:43,925 --> 00:56:46,959
- That's fine.
- Are you actors now?

605
00:56:46,997 --> 00:56:48,783
Nearly.

606
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,660
I'm going to give you
words to work on.

607
00:56:53,698 --> 00:56:56,559
As a base for your physical work.

608
00:56:57,653 --> 00:57:02,396
Asal, I thought of the word
"overwhelmed".

609
00:57:02,434 --> 00:57:07,349
And the sentence I want to give you, is:
"I'm overwhelmed by what I have to carry."

610
00:57:07,388 --> 00:57:11,996
- When it just becomes too much.
- So I carry many things?

611
00:57:12,034 --> 00:57:15,836
You can also look upon it as a picture.

612
00:57:15,874 --> 00:57:18,869
Like:
"You've got a lot to carry, as a person."

613
00:57:19,426 --> 00:57:25,263
You've got a lot of loss and sorrow
and responsibility on your shoulders.

614
00:57:26,184 --> 00:57:29,045
I'm so overwhelmed that I fall.

615
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,269
And...

616
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:37,820
I'm dead.

617
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:43,848
I'm a whale that's being hunted.

618
00:57:45,615 --> 00:57:50,338
- Do you know what a whale is?
- It's a big, big, giant fish.

619
00:57:50,376 --> 00:57:54,984
- It's not actually a fish, it's...
- It's a big fish!

620
00:57:55,023 --> 00:57:59,016
Okay? I'm a whale being hunted.

621
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:03,068
It would be a good idea
to write down a project description.

622
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,756
- What it's about.
- Sure.

623
00:58:05,794 --> 00:58:11,439
And describe what they will get out of it,
regarding what they're a part of here.

624
00:58:11,477 --> 00:58:16,508
It will of course be rewarding for them,
but also so important to the audience.

625
00:58:17,045 --> 00:58:19,138
To hear their stories. Right.

626
00:58:19,176 --> 00:58:22,916
The center is also
concerned with in what

627
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,972
way taking part in this
benefits these guys.

628
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:30,677
I think it would be a good idea
to include that.

629
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:33,634
In addition
to the importance of the story told.

630
00:58:36,418 --> 00:58:38,261
- Cool shirt!
- Thank you.

631
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:41,391
I didn't know about the connection

632
00:58:41,429 --> 00:58:47,170
between "fitness" and "witch"
until this summer.

633
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:48,263
Right, I see.

634
00:58:48,288 --> 00:58:52,872
- How could I not see that for so long?
- A flame has been kindled.

635
00:58:52,911 --> 00:58:54,677
Yes. The flame burns.

636
00:58:54,716 --> 00:58:57,768
We went to this refugee center...

637
00:58:58,306 --> 00:59:03,356
I'm just checking that you do things
the way I taught them to you.

638
00:59:03,413 --> 00:59:08,962
Or I'd be a lousy teacher.
Or you a lousy student. One of the two.

639
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,991
Just keep it up
while I work a little with Sigrid.

640
00:59:15,029 --> 00:59:18,716
- Around three, was it?
- Shoukat?

641
00:59:18,754 --> 00:59:23,343
And then it just keeps snowballing.
We've maxed out on the refugee grants.

642
00:59:23,381 --> 00:59:29,352
The activity grants, that is.
And I have access to a theatre.

643
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:35,842
Go to the next exercise. Do the next set,
then we'll talk some more.

644
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:40,815
- We can't just chat.
- Chatting is strictly forbidden here.

645
00:59:42,696 --> 00:59:45,672
I can start challenging myself now.

646
00:59:45,711 --> 00:59:51,260
Or try other exercises,
so I don't stay on the same level forever.

647
00:59:52,431 --> 00:59:55,042
- Here you are.
- Thank you so much.

648
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:58,863
- See you the day after tomorrow.
- Yes.

649
01:00:16,354 --> 01:00:20,194
- Yeah?
- Could this be something?

650
01:00:20,232 --> 01:00:23,976
I don't know what, exactly,
but this does feel like...

651
01:00:24,015 --> 01:00:27,068
- This stuff is perfect.
- Both symbolic and practical.

652
01:00:27,605 --> 01:00:31,656
- For the faceless ones.
- Right, the faceless ones.

653
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:34,594
- It certainly removes the...
- Identity.

654
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:37,455
This feels so grounded.

655
01:00:37,493 --> 01:00:43,176
There's so much noise in the art world.

656
01:00:43,215 --> 01:00:48,149
"Who got grants,
which awards have you won", and so on.

657
01:00:48,188 --> 01:00:53,717
It becomes so elitist,
and overshadows what we have to offer.

658
01:00:55,503 --> 01:00:59,669
It's pretty ridiculous
how so many things fall from above.

659
01:01:00,226 --> 01:01:07,176
I have a project I've been using
to liberate amateurish ecstasy.

660
01:01:07,215 --> 01:01:09,154
- "Amateurish ecstasy"?
- Yeah.

661
01:01:09,192 --> 01:01:15,836
I use it when I enter a new room,
to take in the room.

662
01:01:15,874 --> 01:01:21,365
The point is to become more present
and more sensitive.

663
01:01:22,306 --> 01:01:25,512
I have a YouTube video here.

664
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:30,370
This is an autistic doppelganger.

665
01:01:31,964 --> 01:01:37,954
She communicates with objects in nature
through movement, touch and sounds.

666
01:01:37,992 --> 01:01:42,888
This is her language.
This is how she communicates.

667
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:24,149
The observation goes like this:
As a consequence of a willingness,

668
01:02:24,188 --> 01:02:28,988
or that fires and flames simply
dig into the dance,

669
01:02:29,525 --> 01:02:34,460
or the body, as a representation
of structures we see, yet don't see...

670
01:02:34,498 --> 01:02:37,628
The body cannot help
but feel a little cheated.

671
01:02:38,146 --> 01:02:41,199
Cheated by an overhanging dominance
of the intellect.

672
01:02:45,096 --> 01:02:48,072
You're not alone

673
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:20,655
Asal?

674
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:25,263
- What is this?
- The shower.

675
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,490
I'm not sure if that comes across.

676
01:03:27,528 --> 01:03:33,999
It was not quite what I had in mind,
but like you said, we could also...

677
01:03:34,037 --> 01:03:38,933
We could simply have a sequence
where, for instance, Serwan...

678
01:03:38,972 --> 01:03:46,364
goes about his life, or maybe that just
goes on in the background while we...

679
01:03:46,402 --> 01:03:49,903
You live your life here.
You take a shower,

680
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:53,372
go to the bathroom,
get dressed, sleep...

681
01:03:55,138 --> 01:03:58,268
- Let's see. Is this...
- For the show?

682
01:03:59,112 --> 01:04:03,874
That's great! All right, cool!

683
01:04:03,912 --> 01:04:07,868
Great. Keep on doing that.
How are things going here?

684
01:04:08,405 --> 01:04:14,357
Great! I can do something really
cool here. Let me find the clip.

685
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:19,292
- He looks so small.
- See how well it goes with the sound?

686
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:28,700
May I take your picture?
Smile, because this is hilarious.

687
01:04:28,738 --> 01:04:30,850
Asal?

688
01:04:30,888 --> 01:04:36,591
- Yeah?
- We can't use that one.

689
01:04:36,629 --> 01:04:40,143
- Ragnhild wanted it.
- That won't do. We can't...

690
01:04:40,181 --> 01:04:44,252
I could've been clearer about it,
but we can't use anything we find here.

691
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:47,996
We were only using the backside.

692
01:04:48,034 --> 01:04:52,776
That won't work.
It belongs to Lars, the owner.

693
01:04:52,815 --> 01:04:55,599
- All right.
- It belongs to The Cruelty.

694
01:04:55,637 --> 01:05:00,380
Do not touch anything
that we didn't bring with us here.

695
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:05,122
That will belong to the Theatre of
Cruelty, and we must respect that.

696
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:08,156
All right? Good.
Otherwise - great!

697
01:05:08,194 --> 01:05:11,132
Let's try that.
But then you must tighten it up.

698
01:05:13,685 --> 01:05:16,815
Oh, look at you!

699
01:06:06,773 --> 01:06:13,282
It's no big deal. In a way it's a good
thing. There's a truth in that expression.

700
01:06:14,357 --> 01:06:17,045
- And that one!
- All right.

701
01:06:17,429 --> 01:06:21,192
- There.
- All right.

702
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:26,722
- You use that as dipping sauce?
- On the salad. With tomato and cucumber.

703
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,661
All right.

704
01:06:30,504 --> 01:06:32,770
I think this will do.

705
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:41,314
Hi, Lars! Hi!

706
01:06:43,906 --> 01:06:46,037
Yes! Yes, it was just...

707
01:06:46,076 --> 01:06:48,975
It started at the refugee center.

708
01:06:49,013 --> 01:06:54,908
I met some truly extraordinary people.
They had such powerful stories.

709
01:06:55,445 --> 01:07:01,436
Then it snowballed a bit.
They thought it was really cool idea.

710
01:07:01,474 --> 01:07:07,157
The refugee center workers thought it was
a great activity for the asylum seekers.

711
01:07:07,196 --> 01:07:09,288
I was never actually...

712
01:07:09,826 --> 01:07:12,168
No! No, no, no.

713
01:07:12,706 --> 01:07:18,677
Yes, all right. That was a mistake,
and that should never have happened.

714
01:07:18,716 --> 01:07:23,612
I can guarantee you that won't
ever happen again. It was that one time.

715
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:29,026
I've been crystal clear that anything
belonging to the theatre is off limits.

716
01:07:29,064 --> 01:07:30,965
No one has... No.

717
01:07:32,213 --> 01:07:34,959
No! It's not like we've...

718
01:07:34,997 --> 01:07:39,874
No, you have to... If you'd met
these people, you'd understand me.

719
01:07:39,912 --> 01:07:44,655
Their stories are incredible.

720
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,669
It's so important to share them!

721
01:07:48,226 --> 01:07:51,452
But... Lars, listen to me!

722
01:07:51,490 --> 01:07:56,866
You'd love these people, and if you'd
heard their stories, you'd agree...

723
01:07:56,904 --> 01:07:59,189
Of course I should've called you!

724
01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:03,701
I tried calling you, okay?
Your phone was switched off!

725
01:08:05,621 --> 01:08:09,461
Sorry. Yes. Of course.

726
01:08:10,306 --> 01:08:15,298
With regards to Artaud
and The Cruelty...

727
01:08:15,336 --> 01:08:22,152
It reactualizes all of The Theatre
of Cruelty, or Artaud's ideas...

728
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:27,068
Don't you see what I mean? This is all
in line with your goals for the theatre!

729
01:08:27,605 --> 01:08:31,676
No... No! Please!

730
01:08:54,543 --> 01:08:56,828
- Okay... Hi.
- Hi.

731
01:08:57,346 --> 01:09:01,301
- Need a hand?
- No, we're good.

732
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:05,429
I have an important message.

733
01:09:05,468 --> 01:09:09,058
I just spoke to Lars.

734
01:09:09,096 --> 01:09:13,109
Apparently, the municipality council
signed an agreement with Urbanium

735
01:09:13,148 --> 01:09:18,524
about Vega Scene taking over Cruelty.
Lars was never in the loop.

736
01:09:18,562 --> 01:09:22,325
- What?
- Yes. It's horrible.

737
01:09:22,364 --> 01:09:28,066
Right, so...
This is what everybody has been dreading.

738
01:09:28,104 --> 01:09:31,311
- What about...
- Not Hausmania.

739
01:09:31,349 --> 01:09:34,997
- They're taking over the premises?
- According to Lars,

740
01:09:35,036 --> 01:09:40,642
they have to leave
due to some sort of realignments.

741
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:46,460
- When?
- Now. We have to be out by tomorrow.

742
01:09:46,498 --> 01:09:52,392
- What? That won't work, Gritt.
- It's insane! How can they do that?

743
01:09:52,431 --> 01:09:56,252
But relax. I will find a way.

744
01:09:57,231 --> 01:10:00,168
We have to put this on hold.

745
01:10:01,973 --> 01:10:05,698
Not even on hold.
We will find a way.

746
01:10:05,736 --> 01:10:11,612
We will make it happen,
but it won't be quite like we imagined.

747
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:17,256
For now, let's eat.

748
01:10:17,295 --> 01:10:23,804
Then we will have to pack up,
but I will fix this.

749
01:10:23,842 --> 01:10:27,740
You have the funds,
so we only need to find another place.

750
01:10:27,778 --> 01:10:35,381
Lovely. Fantastic.
Did you send out invitations, Ragnhild?

751
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,621
Back at the watering hole stands
a body observing something else,

752
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:57,500
as the aftermath of a past fire.

753
01:10:57,538 --> 01:10:59,477
It wonders how to unite all this.

754
01:10:59,516 --> 01:11:03,125
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

755
01:11:03,164 --> 01:11:09,135
This body is a witch, since there's no
escaping the fact that we're all witches.

756
01:11:29,141 --> 01:11:31,004
KAIROS

757
01:11:31,042 --> 01:11:34,152
And I, witch, dig my heels in

758
01:11:34,191 --> 01:11:40,930
against that current
which very much shuns motion as a craft,

759
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:43,637
as a profound and
time-consuming practice,

760
01:11:43,661 --> 01:11:46,479
a practice unhampered
by production targets.

761
01:11:46,517 --> 01:11:50,588
All my criminal sides
light the way

762
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:57,269
For the woods and fields
shall rejoice

763
01:11:58,901 --> 01:12:05,525
Where wild dogs

764
01:12:05,564 --> 01:12:11,381
and desert beasts convene

765
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:16,469
Where the arrow worm builds its nest
lays it eggs

766
01:12:16,508 --> 01:12:21,941
dancing where the owl hatches its plans,
blinks

767
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:26,703
Lilith, Lilith

768
01:12:26,741 --> 01:12:34,556
Who darkens my plan with playful words?
Who sees me when I turn away?

769
01:12:34,613 --> 01:12:39,125
Purple plums! and cold diamonds

770
01:12:39,164 --> 01:12:42,120
Pearls? and spasms in my image!

771
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:47,151
The demon lady
hums and spills in a cyclical blood game

772
01:12:57,519 --> 01:12:59,708
- Lilith?
- Never heard of Lilith?

773
01:13:08,156 --> 01:13:09,250
Three, two, one.

774
01:13:09,922 --> 01:13:11,861
Hey.

775
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:15,663
I'm your power animal.

776
01:13:15,701 --> 01:13:20,559
The candy crocodile that comes
with the cover version of Sweet Harmony.

777
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:24,418
I lie there like a vast landscape,
lighting up the night.

778
01:13:24,456 --> 01:13:27,548
Am I your savior
from all minor evils?

779
01:13:28,066 --> 01:13:31,004
I let you float in
rivers of mother's milk.

780
01:13:31,042 --> 01:13:33,922
I remove you
from the slight Norwegian distaste.

781
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,092
You blink to clear your eyes.

782
01:13:36,130 --> 01:13:40,546
You mumble to yourself eventually,
in a trance.

783
01:13:40,584 --> 01:13:43,580
You can't be alone in this.
You need witnesses!

784
01:13:43,618 --> 01:13:47,573
"Father", you say.
"I think I had an epiphany!"

785
01:13:47,612 --> 01:13:52,124
Let's start over.
None of this ever happened.

786
01:13:52,162 --> 01:13:57,039
Your great-grandfather is proud of you.
Your mother loves you.

787
01:13:57,077 --> 01:13:59,823
You're listening to
"A Twin Seeks Its Pod".

788
01:13:59,861 --> 01:14:06,466
- I am Gritt... Dahl.
- Who's never heard of Lilith!

789
01:14:06,504 --> 01:14:11,458
In Genesis, God created male and female,
as male and female he created them.

790
01:14:11,496 --> 01:14:14,185
In Jewish mythology,
Lilith was the first

791
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:17,180
woman,
made equal from the same clay as Adam.

792
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:19,891
She fled,
gave up her safety for the free

793
01:14:19,915 --> 01:14:22,805
and wild,
and then this story about the rib.

794
01:14:22,844 --> 01:14:24,840
She's demonized in Judaism.

795
01:14:24,879 --> 01:14:28,834
According to Jewish writings,
when men have nightly emissions,

796
01:14:28,872 --> 01:14:32,444
it's Lilith riding them
before stealing their sperm.

797
01:14:32,482 --> 01:14:38,588
Me being here now is such serendipity.
I work with performance and rituals...

798
01:14:39,106 --> 01:14:43,138
- Serendipity?
- Destined to happen.

799
01:14:43,176 --> 01:14:45,980
Destined coincidences.

800
01:14:46,018 --> 01:14:51,586
Like Kairos,
"the right moment for something".

801
01:14:51,624 --> 01:14:54,459
Chronos is ordinary time,
while Kairos...

802
01:14:54,483 --> 01:14:55,522
Kairos, right.

803
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:59,516
It's all about recognizing
the meeting of crossroads.

804
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:02,376
This is a crossroads, then.

805
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:07,368
I was just thinking,
because I had this dream first.

806
01:15:07,906 --> 01:15:10,268
- I then started unravelling it.
- What dream?

807
01:15:10,805 --> 01:15:14,012
The one about the White Inflammation.
You can look at it like...

808
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:16,651
Like after the Black
Death. You'd think

809
01:15:16,675 --> 01:15:19,695
they'd want to save the world,
or themselves.

810
01:15:19,733 --> 01:15:23,669
But they saw it as Judgement Day.

811
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:27,509
"Quit whatever you're doing,
go to town, drink and fornicate."

812
01:15:27,548 --> 01:15:31,906
becoming a priest was easy-peasy,
since they were dropping like flies.

813
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:36,725
Now it feels like I'm getting closer
to the knot in the ball of yarn.

814
01:15:39,586 --> 01:15:46,325
- Right now? You feel that?
- Yes, that's what I meant by serendipity.

815
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:50,933
Those who have lived here longest,
get the top floor.

816
01:16:50,972 --> 01:16:57,538
I'm in a bit of a flux right now.
I have it... outdoors.

817
01:18:44,271 --> 01:18:50,031
Simultaneously I seek a peaceful
and argumentative co-existence for myself,

818
01:18:50,069 --> 01:18:56,808
in-between theory and practice.
The arguing regarding which theory

819
01:18:57,346 --> 01:19:01,628
and how to formulate it
to encompass witches, trolls

820
01:19:02,146 --> 01:19:08,194
and bodies with dreams
of profound, tangible changes.

821
01:19:14,895 --> 01:19:19,714
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm sorry for...

822
01:19:19,752 --> 01:19:24,284
back when we created societies
and developed civilization,

823
01:19:24,322 --> 01:19:30,255
this was due to us developing reasoning
and language to be able to communicate.

824
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:34,863
Hi.

825
01:19:40,584 --> 01:19:43,733
You disappeared at some point?

826
01:19:43,772 --> 01:19:48,399
- Yes. Any water here?
- Water? Of course.

827
01:19:48,437 --> 01:19:50,588
My nerves are so frayed right now.

828
01:20:15,183 --> 01:20:17,372
HI, WHEN DO WE MEET?

829
01:20:28,623 --> 01:20:31,810
- Hello!
- Hi.

830
01:20:31,848 --> 01:20:35,458
- Nice to see you! How are you?
- Good.

831
01:20:35,496 --> 01:20:41,045
- Do you live around here?
- No, I was at a party up there.

832
01:20:41,084 --> 01:20:47,976
In the women's collective?
I'd love to go there some time.

833
01:20:48,015 --> 01:20:51,816
I played Peer Gynt
for the umpteenth time last night.

834
01:20:51,855 --> 01:20:54,888
I think it was women only there.

835
01:20:55,426 --> 01:20:58,748
What are you up to these days?

836
01:20:59,285 --> 01:21:02,204
- What's it called again? Research.
- Research? Cool.

837
01:21:02,242 --> 01:21:06,082
Something new I'm working on.

838
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:10,940
- The White Infla... The castaways and...
- The white ...?

839
01:21:10,978 --> 01:21:14,108
The White Inflammation,
but also about Scandinavia.

840
01:21:22,383 --> 01:21:27,432
- How does one get admitted here?
- May I have your social security number?

841
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:36,744
You want to do something...
Make a contribution!

842
01:21:36,783 --> 01:21:43,752
Instead I'm just drifting around,
spoiling everything I touch!

843
01:21:45,346 --> 01:21:48,629
It wasn't supposed to be like that,
it just...

844
01:21:52,488 --> 01:21:55,388
I should just stop,
and do something else!

845
01:21:55,925 --> 01:21:59,804
But what would that be?
I don't have any education...

846
01:22:00,860 --> 01:22:04,949
So you have quite a lot going on, then.

847
01:22:04,988 --> 01:22:08,828
Your living situation is complicated.
What about your surroundings?

848
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:13,416
Do you have someone to talk to
about the difficult things?

849
01:22:13,455 --> 01:22:17,986
- My mom is in Gran Canaria.
- What was that?

850
01:22:18,024 --> 01:22:22,095
- My mom is in Gran Canaria.
- She is?

851
01:22:22,152 --> 01:22:24,783
Does she live there?

852
01:22:24,821 --> 01:22:26,972
Yes.

853
01:22:27,663 --> 01:22:33,538
- What about your father?
- He... We're not in touch.

854
01:22:34,402 --> 01:22:39,490
But have you ever experienced hearing
voices those around you can't hear?

855
01:22:39,528 --> 01:22:42,389
Or seen things
those around you can't see?

856
01:22:42,428 --> 01:22:45,173
Both yes and no.

857
01:22:46,152 --> 01:22:49,839
Yes, because in a way
it feels like I do that all the time.

858
01:22:49,877 --> 01:22:54,677
So maybe I hear things differently,
or respond differently to them?

859
01:22:54,716 --> 01:22:58,383
Otherwise,
people wouldn't behave like they do.

860
01:22:58,421 --> 01:23:01,493
Have you thought about
taking your own life?

861
01:23:01,532 --> 01:23:06,255
Yes, sure.
But it's always been that way,

862
01:23:06,312 --> 01:23:10,076
so that's nothing new.
That's just...

863
01:23:10,133 --> 01:23:12,944
that it would be a
relief to let go. But I'm

864
01:23:12,968 --> 01:23:15,740
sure it's like that for everyone,
at times.

865
01:23:15,778 --> 01:23:17,871
What stops you?

866
01:23:19,829 --> 01:23:23,343
From taking my own life?

867
01:23:26,242 --> 01:23:29,026
What do you live for?

868
01:23:36,053 --> 01:23:39,912
I think we're done here,
unless you have more to add?

869
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:41,909
- From the list?
- No.

870
01:23:41,948 --> 01:23:46,364
Our impression of your situation,

871
01:23:46,402 --> 01:23:50,588
is that you are clearly
going through a crisis.

872
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:54,428
An admission...

873
01:23:54,965 --> 01:23:59,804
would probably not
be our best choice today.

874
01:23:59,842 --> 01:24:01,781
What do you mean by that?

875
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:07,484
I think you can solve your issues...

876
01:24:09,442 --> 01:24:12,264
out there, in your life.

877
01:24:12,303 --> 01:24:17,333
You are familiar with the system,
with regards to what help you can get?

878
01:24:17,372 --> 01:24:21,135
You have a number of
available social assistance options.

879
01:24:21,173 --> 01:24:25,052
It's important to stress
that you're not alone in this.

880
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:32,405
Putting a kindergarten between two blocks
is an idiotic move by the politicians.

881
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:42,456
EXCITING THEATRE WORKSHOP AT THE THEATRE
OF CRUELTY WITH REFSTAD REFUGEE CENTER

882
01:24:46,844 --> 01:24:48,860
REMOVE TAG

883
01:24:52,642 --> 01:24:55,192
Did you use The Cruelty
without permission?

884
01:24:55,216 --> 01:24:57,672
A very upset Lars
just called the center.

885
01:24:57,711 --> 01:25:01,570
Hope there's a reasonable explanation,
regarding the grants and all.

886
01:25:17,832 --> 01:25:20,111
HI, GRY-JEANETTE!
SO YOU'RE IN THE COUNTRY?

887
01:25:20,135 --> 01:25:22,039
WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE YOU DURING HÆLMIS.

888
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:27,375
THE HARVEST FESTIVAL

889
01:26:42,428 --> 01:26:45,308
- Dear God, it's been so long!
- 20 years!

890
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:49,973
- I wasn't sure if you'd come.
- I did write that I would.

891
01:26:50,012 --> 01:26:52,930
- Oh, right.
- It was just a bit hard to...

892
01:26:52,968 --> 01:26:55,426
Right. That circular feeling.

893
01:26:55,676 --> 01:26:59,362
- Peek-a-boo! It's Gry-Jeanette!
- Gritt!

894
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:03,183
Let's get you some lasagne!
Something to drink?

895
01:27:03,221 --> 01:27:05,333
Would you like beer or wine?

896
01:27:05,372 --> 01:27:08,213
You may not like it.

897
01:27:08,252 --> 01:27:12,764
- I brew my own beer.
- I'll say! Wow.

898
01:27:12,802 --> 01:27:16,796
I'm sorry that we started without you.
The kids get so hungry.

899
01:27:16,834 --> 01:27:19,088
Sorry for being so late.

900
01:27:19,112 --> 01:27:23,304
Not your fault. We're
used to cold dinners.

901
01:27:23,343 --> 01:27:29,237
Did you ride a bike here?
Did you take the old Moss Road?

902
01:27:29,276 --> 01:27:33,845
I would, but today I came by train.
Or replacement bus.

903
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:43,714
Quite a mall they've built here.

904
01:27:43,752 --> 01:27:50,165
It was like an octopus
spreading its tentacles.

905
01:27:50,204 --> 01:27:54,351
It's very handy to have one of those here.

906
01:27:57,826 --> 01:28:03,644
And very handy that we can drive right in.
We're often in a bit of a hurry.

907
01:28:03,682 --> 01:28:05,640
Yeah, often in a hurry.

908
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:08,712
Gritt is an actor!

909
01:28:08,751 --> 01:28:11,708
Are you a celebrity?

910
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:16,085
Do you go to lots of auditions and such?

911
01:28:16,124 --> 01:28:21,058
Nope. Only in the very beginning,
before I found my niche.

912
01:28:21,096 --> 01:28:24,168
So you gave up on the big dream?

913
01:28:24,706 --> 01:28:28,028
You're no longer aspiring
to become a famous actress?

914
01:28:28,546 --> 01:28:30,562
What makes you say that?

915
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:36,476
Reality catches up with most people,
and you have to adjust.

916
01:28:36,514 --> 01:28:40,085
I do performance.
Two completely different worlds.

917
01:28:40,124 --> 01:28:41,468
Performance? Okay.

918
01:28:42,005 --> 01:28:46,882
- It's about staging an event...
- There, there.

919
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:51,855
- Can you make a living doing that?
- Gritt has done many exciting things.

920
01:28:51,893 --> 01:28:56,655
- Worked abroad, and...
- But it does require...

921
01:28:56,693 --> 01:29:00,303
a more moderate lifestyle.

922
01:29:00,341 --> 01:29:06,332
Financially.
Less materially orientated.

923
01:29:06,370 --> 01:29:08,885
You have to sort of...

924
01:29:08,924 --> 01:29:12,879
- Do you have children?
- No.

925
01:29:12,917 --> 01:29:15,663
No children of my own.

926
01:29:15,701 --> 01:29:23,439
I simply wouldn't dare.
Considering what we're entering into.

927
01:29:23,477 --> 01:29:26,680
The upheaval. The
impending catastrophe...

928
01:29:26,704 --> 01:29:28,066
What catastrophe?

929
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:34,114
The climate catastrophe. The
ecological catastrophe. The apocalypse.

930
01:29:34,152 --> 01:29:36,975
We're not quite there yet.

931
01:29:37,013 --> 01:29:41,832
- I do get what you mean.
- We need to think outside the box more.

932
01:29:41,871 --> 01:29:46,536
Yeah, bringing children into the world
is stupid when everything's going to hell.

933
01:29:46,575 --> 01:29:53,045
- Sorry about putting you here, kids.
- There's a lot of research on this.

934
01:29:53,084 --> 01:29:57,058
Please take Torje.

935
01:29:58,133 --> 01:30:02,108
- So that we get some...
- Let's get you changed.

936
01:30:03,816 --> 01:30:06,773
Sorry about that, Gry-Jeanette.

937
01:30:06,812 --> 01:30:08,751
Gritt.

938
01:30:08,789 --> 01:30:13,301
Why do you speak that dialect
if you're from around here?

939
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:19,119
Good question. I used to live in a place
called The Valley of Saron.

940
01:30:19,157 --> 01:30:22,805
- Heard of The Valley of Saron?
- No.

941
01:30:22,844 --> 01:30:27,740
It's a valley where everybody's Christian,
and they all believe in God and Jesus.

942
01:30:27,778 --> 01:30:31,733
My six half-sisters and me
started a group called "Seven Sisters",

943
01:30:31,772 --> 01:30:37,320
We sang in the Sunday church service.
Our father was the pastor.

944
01:30:37,359 --> 01:30:41,333
That was pretty intense.

945
01:30:41,372 --> 01:30:45,308
When I was 12,
my mom divorced my dad.

946
01:30:45,826 --> 01:30:49,090
We moved here. Our apartment building
was called "Gøsjeblokka".

947
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:09,077
is intelligent and creative,
and grants high status.

948
01:31:09,116 --> 01:31:16,757
It's about five guys courting this one
lady, and then she picks one of them.

949
01:31:19,426 --> 01:31:22,690
Don't discuss all the exciting stuff
without me!

950
01:31:22,728 --> 01:31:26,184
and just as I finished,

951
01:31:26,223 --> 01:31:30,255
I realized I had squeezed out
a little Hitler on Mathias.

952
01:31:30,293 --> 01:31:31,388
That guy.

953
01:31:31,944 --> 01:31:34,133
It wasn't easy to make them laugh.

954
01:31:34,172 --> 01:31:38,933
- What about him?
- I knew him a little.

955
01:31:38,972 --> 01:31:41,794
Oh! Of course you know
some of those people.

956
01:31:41,832 --> 01:31:44,789
I have his sperm in my freezer.

957
01:31:46,498 --> 01:31:49,205
I have his sperm in my freezer.

958
01:31:49,244 --> 01:31:53,218
Usually...
You should listen to this too, Vilja.

959
01:31:54,140 --> 01:31:58,882
You know Eve and Adam?
There was a woman before Eve,

960
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:01,685
and her name was Lilith.

961
01:32:01,724 --> 01:32:05,948
In Jewish Mythology,
it's said that Lilith...

962
01:32:06,485 --> 01:32:10,383
steals the sperm
from the nightly emissions of men.

963
01:32:10,421 --> 01:32:15,298
Wait, stealing?
Which also resonates well with Artaud...

964
01:32:22,805 --> 01:32:24,764
Are you okay?

965
01:32:24,802 --> 01:32:26,972
Yes.

966
01:32:27,586 --> 01:32:33,365
- How's your love life? Anything going on?
- I gave that up.

967
01:32:33,404 --> 01:32:36,456
You can't give that up!
You didn't, did you?

968
01:32:36,514 --> 01:32:40,277
Being in a couple, a relationship,
isn't for everyone.

969
01:32:40,316 --> 01:32:47,112
You're complicating matters for yourself
now. You've always made things hard,

970
01:32:47,151 --> 01:32:53,525
but giving up love may be
what makes it hardest to be you right now.

971
01:32:53,564 --> 01:32:56,463
I can tell that you're not doing so well.

972
01:32:56,501 --> 01:33:00,226
I know that you're a good person,
and easy to love.

973
01:33:00,264 --> 01:33:06,140
But when you don't let anyone in,
that makes it hard to fall for you.

974
01:33:06,178 --> 01:33:09,805
Why do you always
have to do that? Choosing

975
01:33:09,829 --> 01:33:13,148
the difficult paths
instead of just...

976
01:33:13,666 --> 01:33:18,677
giving yourself some slack.
All this overthinking of yours...

977
01:35:47,669 --> 01:35:51,260
THE HERMIT

978
01:36:22,959 --> 01:36:26,108
Whistles

979
01:36:26,664 --> 01:36:32,520
Does the dream have a father?

980
01:36:32,559 --> 01:36:39,317
Adam said she was too wild

981
01:36:42,255 --> 01:36:47,919
All my criminal sides
light the way

982
01:36:47,957 --> 01:36:52,757
for the woods and fields
shall rejoice

983
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:16,239
And when life
flings the unexpected at us...

984
01:44:16,277 --> 01:44:22,172
To belong in this extremely individualized
society ours is turning into...

985
01:44:22,229 --> 01:44:26,012
Our own vanity,
and what we'd like to leave behind,

986
01:44:26,069 --> 01:44:29,775
is connected to the
fact that life changes.

987
01:44:29,813 --> 01:44:36,245
There is light and darkness,
pain and joy. Tenderness...

988
01:44:55,599 --> 01:44:59,535
Next: The hunger issues of the world
are increasing.

989
01:44:59,573 --> 01:45:06,044
The goal of abolishing extreme poverty
before 2030, has become more difficult.

990
01:45:08,981 --> 01:45:12,104
The search for the
last missing person

991
01:45:12,128 --> 01:45:15,759
after the Troms avalanche
will resume today.

992
01:45:15,797 --> 01:45:21,615
Four skiers where taken by an avalanche
at Blueberry Hill this January.

993
01:45:21,653 --> 01:45:24,970
Three were found,
but despite four weeks of

994
01:45:24,994 --> 01:45:28,412
tireless searching,
the last victim was not.

995
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:30,965
Now, summer is here, and...

996
01:45:56,117 --> 01:45:58,172
Cheers.

997
01:47:07,042 --> 01:47:12,783
This is an elixir.
A potion I've been experimenting with.

998
01:47:12,821 --> 01:47:18,696
- Exciting. Green and pretty.
- Yeah, the color is all right.

999
01:47:18,735 --> 01:47:21,634
It almost looks a bit poisonous!
Exciting.

1000
01:47:21,672 --> 01:47:24,303
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1001
01:47:24,341 --> 01:47:29,064
And thank you so much
for all your... aid.

1002
01:47:29,103 --> 01:47:31,042
You're welcome.

1003
01:48:15,144 --> 01:48:18,082
Hello. Guten Tag.

1004
01:48:18,120 --> 01:48:20,962
Bonjour. Hola.

1005
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:24,149
Salaam aleikum. Konnichi wa.

1006
01:48:24,188 --> 01:48:26,856
Tjänare. Hei.

1007
01:49:03,548 --> 01:49:09,192
When we have eradicated all biological
life as we know it, including ourselves,

1008
01:49:09,231 --> 01:49:13,973
something else will take over
and lust for life.

1009
01:49:19,733 --> 01:49:24,648
I like to think
that life itself is a thinking being.

1010
01:49:26,568 --> 01:49:32,962
A being spawning concepts
as a mechanism for survival.

1011
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,013
To ensure the continuation of life.

1012
01:49:39,068 --> 01:49:44,405
And that
life itself has a remembrance of the past,

1013
01:49:44,444 --> 01:49:49,589
and that chaos takes on a shape
by recalling the past embodied in us.

1014
01:49:51,183 --> 01:49:55,119
In our cells. In our habits.
