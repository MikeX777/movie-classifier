1
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,939
Mom...

2
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:04,310
l wanted to be with you longer.

3
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:09,419
l wanted to talk about
all kind of things with you. 

4
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:14,379
We never talked about Dad...

5
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,069
Miss Katsumi.

6
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,229
Here.

7
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,830
Ms. Fuyuka figured
she may never see you again... 

8
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:43,349
...so she wanted me to give this
to you directly, together with a message. 

9
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,310
lt's up to you
how you wish to use it. 

10
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,250
She says the path you ought to take...

11
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,610
...is written in this book.

12
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,520
''To my daughter Katsumi''...

13
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:06,139
Gigelf Liqueur.

14
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,889
Dad?

15
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,599
The wind. Spirits of the atmosphere.

16
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,939
Speak your master's name.

17
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,789
Why this?

18
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,900
l don't want any of Dad's magic...

19
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,650
No way. Not this.

20
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,460
NO!

21
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,659
Mom...

22
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,080
Attention to all passengers boarding
flight 205 for Los City via Hawaii. 

23
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,900
We are now commencing
pre-boarding procedures. 

24
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,680
Make your way to counters 633 and 634.

25
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,990
Here you go.

26
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,860
l'm sorry, Miss, but you cannot depart
the country with this ID. 

27
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,550
Huh? What do you mean?

28
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,079
l've been here for less than ten days.

29
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,800
Besides, why can't l leave here
to return to my own country? 

30
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:40,209
Miss, you became a citizen of
this country yesterday, didn't you? 

31
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,170
Your residence is registered as Tokyo,
so please return after acquiring a visa. 

32
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:49,860
No way. Who would do that?

33
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,850
l should've figured it was you guys.

34
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:19,730
Um, did Kiddy do something
by any chance? 

35
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:22,810
That's right! This is the work
of that muscle woman. 

36
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,939
She's the one who changed my ID
without my knowledge! 

37
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:28,259
l have no idea what you're talking about.

38
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,110
We've been told by our chief
to continue guarding you. 

39
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,399
We don't know anything beyond that.

40
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,660
ls that so? So that's how it is.

41
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,389
Then take me to your chief!

42
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,500
Well, l would be happy to take you there...

43
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:46,899
...but this is a two-seater.

44
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,779
l'm sorry but if you wanna see her,
go there on your own. 

45
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,079
The Chief is in Department 65.

46
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,560
All right, then! Forget it!

47
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,569
Um, Miss Katsumi!

48
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,060
l'm sorry.

49
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:07,430
Kiddy, you didn't have to be so cold.

50
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,089
She just lost her mother.

51
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:14,589
Nami. Hurry up and get on!
We're gonna lose sight of her. 

52
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,579
Could it be that you dislike Katsumi?

53
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,480
There are no likes or dislikes on the job.

54
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,610
l like Katsumi.

55
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,800
She actually seems a lot like you.

56
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,279
Hey Aida, who was that?

57
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,269
Apparently she's here to see
the chief of AMP. 

58
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,290
Really. So she's not a friend of yours?

59
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,389
No, she's not.

60
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:04,430
l would love to be friends
with such a beautiful woman. 

61
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,980
You've got bad taste.

62
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,339
What in the world
do you think you're doing?! 

63
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:21,310
Changing the address on my ID
without permission?! 

64
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,300
l thought l was done with you guys!

65
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,709
Let me return to Hawaii!

66
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,980
Then everything will be over, right?!

67
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:32,410
Regrettably, things haven't even started yet.

68
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,829
Also, you have become
a member of AMP starting today. 

69
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,129
What?

70
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:38,879
Chief!

71
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:40,870
We've made living arrangements
for you here. 

72
00:07:41,189 --> 00:07:42,920
You'll have everything you need.

73
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,620
Why...why me?!

74
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,629
Over the past few months...

75
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,819
...the number of Lucifer Hawk victims
have been on the rise. 

76
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,029
The helpless humans...people of this city
who are powerless against them... 

77
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,379
...are killed with no means
to fight back. 

78
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,439
That's got nothing to do with me!

79
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:02,490
Whatever happens to
complete strangers... 

80
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:04,920
...or whether the city is
infested with monsters. 

81
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,360
These things have nothing
to do with me! 

82
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,949
l couldn't help, anyway!

83
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,220
l'm sure you've realized by now
that you have the power. 

84
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,769
Tremendous power
inherited from your parents. 

85
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:17,060
No way!

86
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:20,279
Are you...
are you telling me to use magic?! 

87
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,660
The same magic that killed
my mom...and my dad? 

88
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,379
You're telling me to use that magic?

89
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:29,189
Absolutely not!

90
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,339
Katsumi, Ms. Fuyuka was...

91
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,960
Stop it!

92
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,340
l've had enough! This talk of
magic and monsters...l want no more of it! 

93
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,840
Katsumi, um...

94
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,570
Chief!

95
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,059
l don't know what kinda power she has,
but she doesn't even wanna... 

96
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,440
Kiddy!

97
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,379
She is...Katsumi is crucial
to AMP's operations. 

98
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,129
That's right.

99
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,730
Not only AMP.
Her existence is necessary to humanity. 

100
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:59,889
And the same can be said
for our enemies. 

101
00:09:10,409 --> 00:09:11,899
Hey, it moved!

102
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:17,100
lt finally moved. That was a long wait.

103
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,850
But it'll still  be a little longer.

104
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,200
Hey Mom, please.
l'll keep my promise. 

105
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,779
No. l just bought you one the other day.

106
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,460
But it's not the same
as the other one. So please. 

107
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:40,850
Please!

108
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:42,840
Maybe next time.

109
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:44,629
No, right now!

110
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,399
Please. l'll help you
around the house. Please. 

111
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,200
See, the lady's laughing at you for
being naughty. So wait until the next time. 

112
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,009
Okay...

113
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,220
Huh? It's raining.

114
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,659
Welcome.

115
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,759
Excuse me.
l'll have a coffee please. 

116
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,210
Sure.

117
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,059
Are those tropical fish real?

118
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:36,080
This shop isn't making that much money.

119
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,000
Ah, hey! Wait!

120
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,879
Wait a minute!

121
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:28,580
Oh, l'm sorry...

122
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,549
l'm sorry. l'm sorry!

123
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,409
That person...

124
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:37,620
Ow! Let go of me, you idiot!

125
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,769
You could learn to shut up!

126
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,629
Katsumi!

127
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,470
Um, it would be wise
to stay out of the rain. 

128
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,500
lt will make you sick.

129
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,759
You run into problems like this
because you're absentminded. 

130
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,820
Would you stop giving us extra work?

131
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:59,159
Why?
Kiddy! 

132
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,509
You're the ones following me
without my asking! 

133
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,490
Come on! Would you try and
understand the position you're in, already?! 

134
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:09,269
Again? And those people too.

135
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:13,620
Like l said, don't meddle in my affairs!
Leave me alone! 

136
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,250
How long will you keep
talking like a brat? 

137
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:18,919
Then fine, l'm a brat.

138
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:20,399
You... !

139
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:21,769
The wind?

140
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,700
She's back.

141
00:12:25,909 --> 00:12:27,279
Where is she?

142
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:29,320
Hey, what's wrong?

143
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:34,019
l feel it. Gigelf's power.

144
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,120
No way...

145
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:38,899
Hey, come on, what's the matter?!

146
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,169
Kiddy...

147
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:44,759
ls it here?

148
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:46,759
Yes.

149
00:12:46,929 --> 00:12:49,539
lt's very slight, but there is a disruption
in the spiritual pressure. 

150
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,950
What?

151
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,480
Are you okay?!

152
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,190
What in the world just happened here?

153
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,110
This is terrible!

154
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,460
Contact the Chief.

155
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,210
Right.

156
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:18,019
Are you all right?
Hang in there! 

157
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,970
An ambulance
will be here right away. 

158
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,580
The wind...suddenly.

159
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,360
Yes, l'll report when l find out more.

160
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,000
My daughter...where's my daughter?!

161
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,379
No! No way!

162
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,450
l can't take this anymore!

163
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,509
NO!

164
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:52,049
Katsumi!

165
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:54,659
Katsumi! 

166
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:06,980
Seems like the wind is stirring.

167
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:11,940
They likely awakened
after sensing the power. 

168
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:16,090
All that power is going to
belong to us, right? 

169
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,220
Yeah. But there appears to be
too many obstacles getting in the way. 

170
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:22,519
We must do a little cleaning up.

171
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,559
You're right.

172
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:35,399
That's the general outline of this incident.

173
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,330
lt doesn't seem to be caused by
any type of explosive. 

174
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,610
And you, Nami?

175
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:43,029
Yes. l did sense something.

176
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:44,559
But it's inconclusive?

177
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:45,889
Yes.

178
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,600
And what about Katsumi?

179
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,629
Well, she suddenly...

180
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:51,539
You lost sight of her?

181
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:53,899
Yes, l'm sorry.

182
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:55,129
l understand.

183
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,159
We'll trace her signal from our end.

184
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,820
You can call it a day
once you're done. 

185
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:02,299
Yes. Roger that.

186
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:05,970
All we know is that it was windy.

187
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:10,409
We know that there were irregular winds
for 3.8 seconds in that area... 

188
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,960
...coming from Tokyo Bay.

189
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:16,820
However the energy level of the wind itself
was rather small. 

190
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,070
lsn't that a restricted section?

191
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,080
Yes. Restricted area D-13.

192
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,360
But there's practically nothing here
other than the former Tokyo Bay Bridge. 

193
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,100
Hmm...

194
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,370
Wait. Could it be the bridge...?

195
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,720
l'm sick of this city.

196
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,129
l wanna go somewhere.

197
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,059
Mom.

198
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,980
What should l do?
And where can l go? 

199
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,240
Huh? What's going on?

200
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,779
l can't move.

201
00:16:05,289 --> 00:16:08,159
This rain. She warned me that
it would make me sick. 

202
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:10,879
lt's cold.
This suit was expensive, too. 

203
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:16,110
l'm gonna die here. l can...

204
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,070
...l can be with Mom.

205
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,730
Darling.

206
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:12,569
Huh? Where am l?

207
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:14,329
What happened?

208
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,059
Oh, you're awake.

209
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:22,920
You should stay there.
You need to get some more rest. 

210
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,039
l'm making some coffee.

211
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,599
Who is this girl?

212
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,099
Come to think of it, l collapsed after
getting soaked in the rain. 

213
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,410
l'm still alive.

214
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,619
Are you okay?

215
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,940
Do you have a headache
or anything? 

216
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:45,069
Ah, l think l'm all right.

217
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,529
l'm glad.

218
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,420
You did get soaked pretty bad,
so you might not feel well for a while. 

219
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,400
But give yourself a good night's rest and
you'll feel fine in the morning. 

220
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:55,410
Oh, sorry!

221
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,220
l'll bring your coffee right away.

222
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,950
Feel free to wear that gown over there.
It's mine so it may be a bit small for you. 

223
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,240
How do you take your coffee?

224
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,269
How was it?
Did you like the coffee? 

225
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,829
Yeah, very much.

226
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:18,400
Really? l'm glad.

227
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,559
lt's my special blend.

228
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:24,309
Hmm...this is good enough
to serve at a coffee shop. 

229
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:28,519
By the way, l came across these delicious
cookies the other day, so l bought some. 

230
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:31,910
But eating at this time of night
might add to the waistline. 

231
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,930
l haven't asked you your name yet.

232
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,019
Oh, right.

233
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,339
l'm Yuki. Yuki Saiko.

234
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,339
l'm Katsumi Liqueur.

235
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,789
Thank you for saving me.

236
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,599
lf you hadn't passed me by chance,
l might've been dead by now. 

237
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:55,670
Did you perhaps think
you didn't mind dying at the time? 

238
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:01,970
Uh...l'm not really sure.

239
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,250
l was feeling kinda lightheaded.

240
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:08,490
l know l was thinking how l hated this city
and wanted to go somewhere fast. 

241
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:11,390
But there was no place l could go.

242
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:14,390
Please don't say such sad things.

243
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,470
l like this city.
And l like you too, Katsumi. 

244
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:20,980
Um, wait.

245
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,890
l'm not at all saying that
l dislike you personally, Yuki. 

246
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:30,250
Besides, l only met you today...
or more like moments ago. 

247
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:32,579
There's no like or dislike
toward you yet. 

248
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,710
And as far as the city's concerned...

249
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,470
l can sorta tell.
It's fate. Probably. 

250
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:41,779
lt's the same with our encounter.

251
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,160
We'll be working
at the same place, and... 

252
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:47,500
Don't tell me you're into
fortunetelling or prophecies! 

253
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,200
Huh? Um. It's my hunch.
Like an inspiration, maybe. 

254
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,400
l can't stand that sorta stuff!

255
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,630
Stuff like fortunetelling, prophecies,
the future, fate, and magic! 

256
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,250
Huh?

257
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,640
l'm sorry. l just remembered
something unpleasant, so... 

258
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,329
No, l'm sorry too.

259
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:15,539
Why don't we call it a night?
Huh? Oh, l guess. 

260
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,390
l'm really sorry. Don't worry about it, Yuki.
l didn't mean you... 

261
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,809
lt's all right. l understand.

262
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,059
What's important right now is that
you get some rest so you feel better. 

263
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:00,089
Everything is normal in the Kerberos
district of the restricted section D-13. 

264
00:21:00,589 --> 00:21:02,900
And nothing particularly abnormal
by the Bay Bridge. 

265
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:05,220
Lebia, don't you feel it?

266
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:07,779
Then this is...

267
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,690
Right. The fierceness of these waves.

268
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,750
And their numbers...Lebia!

269
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:32,279
We were being careless.

270
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:34,259
Lebia, are you all right?

271
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,230
l knew you would come,
Rally Cheyenne. 

272
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:42,779
l know about you.

273
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,289
Today, l'm just here
to give you a warning. 

274
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,859
Do not get in our way,
for your own good. 

275
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,460
That's not a warning.
It seems like you're begging. 

276
00:21:55,539 --> 00:22:00,490
l waited a long time for
Gigelf's blood and power. 

277
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:02,869
Then why don't you hurry and do it?

278
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:09,650
We are not so foolish as to
attack someone guarded by that power. 

279
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,759
First, we will have
Gigelf's daughter learn the truth... 

280
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:16,400
...and then wait for our chance.

281
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:17,609
Chief!

282
00:22:18,329 --> 00:22:20,000
Please stand back!

283
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,029
Lebia! Watch out!

284
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:29,460
Lebia!

285
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,140
A second-rate monster like you
should think twice before pissing me off! 

286
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:12,869
Dad...

287
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:17,839
The great sorcerer Gigelf who had
perfected the powers of magic. 

288
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:33,380
What did you do in this city, Dad?

289
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,730
That dream...where was that place?

290
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,940
Mom was calling out to Dad.

291
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,460
Was that my memory?

292
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,259
Mom...
Dad... 

293
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:05,380
That red blood...
l like it very much. 

294
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:09,480
There was a time
when l cursed this blood. 

295
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:11,819
Humans are so self-centered.

296
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,549
They're the ones
who guided us to this world. 

297
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,990
And the humans broke the agreement.

298
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,000
You're referring to only
a few humans. 

299
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,319
l will never let you try to kill
all the people in this city. 

300
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,750
What?

301
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,839
Another enemy?

302
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,799
They got away.

303
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:53,279
How am l gonna explain that
to everyone? 

304
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,309
Lebia.

305
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,319
Are you all right?

306
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,660
Chief, where is the Lucifer Hawk?

307
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,740
Sorry. They got away.

308
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,079
Chief, you're hurt!

309
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:14,980
l'm okay. Your injuries are worse.

310
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:17,250
No, l'm fine.

311
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:19,539
Are you sure?

312
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:23,250
lf this next enemy awakens,
it could be a big problem. 

313
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:36,210
Thank you.

314
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,630
Your coffee was delicious.

315
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,839
Katsumi!

316
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:50,509
Where are you going,
so early in the morning? 

317
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,250
Well...um...

318
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,049
Oh, of course!

319
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,470
Breakfast, right? Give me a moment.
l'll go with you. 

320
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,460
You have quite the appetite
for someone your size. 

321
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,250
You think so?

322
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,079
But breakfast is the most important
meal of the day, right? 

323
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:25,970
Besides, l'm still growing.

324
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,410
Why would you wanna get any bigger
than you are now? 

325
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,069
Katsumi. That pendant...

326
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,349
Huh? Oh.
It's my dad's keepsake. 

327
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:37,599
Although l don't remember his face.

328
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,529
You don't?

329
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:41,670
l'm not surprised that's
a keepsake. 

330
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,039
You held it tightly and wouldn't let it go
even when you were unconscious. 

331
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:47,430
l was holding this?

332
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,150
You're fortunate, Katsumi...

333
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,049
...to have a keepsake
and memories of your parents. 

334
00:26:54,269 --> 00:26:56,019
But l have bad memories too.

335
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,220
But it's better than nothing.

336
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,640
l have nothing.

337
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,470
Yuki. We'll part ways here.

338
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,619
What do you mean?

339
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,059
lf you stay too close to me,
you'll find yourself in all kinds of trouble. 

340
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:18,400
Besides, l need to get back
to my hometown. 

341
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,589
You're lying!
Katsumi, the truth is... 

342
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,430
The truth is...
l...  

343
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:27,529
l don't think
l'll ever learn to like this city. 

344
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,990
l have no friends
or acquaintances here. 

345
00:27:30,339 --> 00:27:31,240
You're wrong!

346
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,099
There are people here
who are important to you! 

347
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,730
Thank you. Bye.

348
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,400
Katsumi, wait!

349
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,000
One person has come out.

350
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:56,019
What? It's too early.
It must be someone else. 

351
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,869
We'll know right away.

352
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,690
lt's confirmed. That's Katsumi.

353
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,500
There she goes bustling about
this early in the morning. 

354
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:08,890
l can't even eat my breakfast in peace!

355
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:11,049
Hey Kiddy!

356
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,009
You mustn't throw away
your trash here! 

357
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,539
Nami!

358
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:18,250
How dare you!
Stop it! 

359
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:28,059
U-Um...

360
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:30,470
Leave me alone. Please.

361
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:33,279
Just stay away from me.

362
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,029
But, your...

363
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,869
l'm not the kinda person you think l am.

364
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:41,950
lf you continue sticking to me,
you'll get hurt. 

365
00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:44,390
Why is that? Why?

366
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,000
Why are you throwing
everything away, Katsumi? 

367
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,200
Why do you insist on dying?

368
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,269
l know what you're thinking.

369
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,230
But l don't like it.
It's not right. 

370
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,359
You deny your existence
and live in your memories. 

371
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,380
Katsumi, you are very important to me!

372
00:30:05,099 --> 00:30:06,619
l like you very much!

373
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,289
Chief!

374
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:45,299
You should be taking the day off.

375
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:47,690
You may not realize it,
but l'm quite busy. 

376
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,769
How's your shoulder?
Does it hurt? 

377
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:54,619
l've wrapped the wound
so it's a bit stiff, but it doesn't hurt. 

378
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,049
Good.

379
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,920
What about Katsumi?

380
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,460
Right, Kiddy and Nami have been on her
since this morning. 

381
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:05,220
Who's this girl?

382
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,740
Right, her name is Yuki Saiko.

383
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,740
She's been with Katsumi
since last night. 

384
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,119
Gather whatever data is
available on her, just in case. 

385
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:16,200
Sure. Please give me a minute.

386
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,730
What's the matter?

387
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,130
lt seems there are people
who don't want us finding out about her. 

388
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:29,779
l'll disable the block.

389
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:33,019
What is it?

390
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:35,430
There's significant protection
on the data. 

391
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:37,599
lt's likely a very large organization.

392
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,819
The government?
Probably. 

393
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:47,549
lPER Project.
Do you know of it? 

394
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,579
Yeah. l've heard rumors about it.

395
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,430
Mind wave enhancement
through genetic manipulation. 

396
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:56,710
lf l remember correctly, that project
was abolished a number of years ago. 

397
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,269
l'll check into it myself.

398
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,019
Don't tell anyone about this.

399
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:03,890
Yes, l understand.

400
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:21,440
Here you are, Katsumi.

401
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:22,519
Thank you.

402
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,109
ls this place really okay?

403
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,339
Yes. At first sight, it's the same
as the restricted areas... 

404
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:31,329
...but it is on the outside.

405
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:33,829
Being as it is,
people don't come here. 

406
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:39,180
After all, if you step into a restricted area,
the police would come flying to catch you. 

407
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,910
We wouldn't be able to talk like this.

408
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:47,190
l'm an orphan.

409
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,089
So l have no idea
what my parents look like. 

410
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,799
l don't have the experience of having them
play with me, or scold me. 

411
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,089
But one thing l do remember well
is that large bridge. 

412
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:10,019
l think l lived in
this neighborhood when l was small. 

413
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:13,539
Every single day l would look
at that bridge. 

414
00:33:15,019 --> 00:33:17,890
l told myself that
good things would happen if l crossed it. 

415
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:20,319
There would be many fun things.

416
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,390
There would be
wonderful encounters. 

417
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,890
And l'd find many nice friends.

418
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,900
l know your secret, Katsumi.

419
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,319
What?

420
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,079
You grind your teeth a lot
while you're asleep. 

421
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:44,890
That's the first time you laughed!

422
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,410
The Katsumi l know
the one l saw in the future! re... 

423
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,849
...always had a wonderful smile.

424
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:53,190
That story again?

425
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:55,910
lf you don't stop it,
l may end up hating you. 

426
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:57,660
Huh? Come on!

427
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:01,829
Don't worry, l'm kidding.
Really? What a relief. 

428
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:07,339
What's the matter, Katsumi?

429
00:34:08,269 --> 00:34:12,079
l know this bridge.
l always saw it too. 

430
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,400
Katsumi.

431
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:25,409
Katsumi!

432
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:40,199
A little further down.

433
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,570
Looks like she's finally arrived.

434
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,610
lt appears so.

435
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:02,710
lt's checkmate at last.

436
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,440
This is the place. l'm certain.

437
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:26,750
What's the matter, Katsumi?

438
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:32,519
l was looking at the bridge from here,
together with Mom. 

439
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,489
Katsumi, this house...

440
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:44,530
This place...

441
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,750
(PICTURE)

442
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,909
lt says Hazuki.

443
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:52,260
Hazuki...

444
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,599
Fukuya Hazuki.
That's Mom's maiden name. 

445
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,409
Before she got together with Dad.

446
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,449
Her name before she married.

447
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,409
Then is this Mom's home?

448
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:14,940
No way. What is this?

449
00:36:17,469 --> 00:36:18,320
Katsumi!

450
00:36:18,699 --> 00:36:20,429
Don't go inside!

451
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:23,739
Huh? Why not?
What do you mean? 

452
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:27,059
Um, anyway, you must not go in.

453
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,699
What?! Is this some vision of yours again?

454
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,460
My mom used to live here!

455
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:36,289
And l've lived here too!

456
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,130
What could possibly be inside?

457
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:41,469
l don't know what we'll find in here...

458
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,449
...but there may be memories of
my mom and my dad in here... 

459
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,900
...that far outweigh any dangers!

460
00:36:48,469 --> 00:36:49,929
But...um...

461
00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:52,929
l'm sorry, Yuki. l'll be fine.

462
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:54,539
l'll be right back.

463
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:55,619
Katsumi!

464
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,280
This room...

465
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,559
Mom's photo.

466
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:57,579
lt's addressed to Mom! From Dad?!

467
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,969
l doubt l'll ever be able
to return to you two again. 

468
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:07,530
Should my body be ripped apart
by the claws of a Lucifer Hawk... 

469
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,780
...l would have
been rightfully punished. 

470
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,099
Should my body disintegrate...

471
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,849
...It would still not compensate
for the crimes l have committed. 

472
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:17,440
Fuyuka.

473
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:19,880
When Katsumi' awakens to her powers...

474
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,130
...hand her my pendant.

475
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:26,599
l've even burdened
Katsumi' with the destiny to be the key. 

476
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,539
My destiny?

477
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,650
Yes.

478
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,949
Gigelf entrusted you with the last of
his magic when you were a baby. 

479
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,739
Who are you?

480
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,340
A monster?

481
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,889
What would you do if l were?

482
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,510
You guys planted this letter!

483
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:52,789
How could we touch anything within
Gigelf's barrier protecting this house? 

484
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,340
Acknowledge the truth,
Katsumi Liqueur. 

485
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,070
You, as well as us
are Gigelf's victims. 

486
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:04,960
Would you please make use
of your powers for our good? 

487
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:14,199
Fine! Do as you wish!

488
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:20,719
Kill me if you'd like.

489
00:39:21,989 --> 00:39:24,570
l have nothing in this city.

490
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,619
No place to go, and no one to see.

491
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,510
You're a pathetic fool...

492
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:36,110
...willingly throwing away the protection
given to you from your parents. 

493
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,769
Humans are strange.

494
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:42,719
They continue protecting
their loved ones, even after death. 

495
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,929
They can now come to greet you
with nothing to fear. 

496
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,849
l will not kill you.

497
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:56,920
You will become one with us
and live in darkness through eternity. 

498
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,050
Katsumi went in there
and hasn't come out! 

499
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,880
Huh? Um, we're...

500
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,909
l know!
You are Katsumi's friends, right?! 

501
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:21,860
Yes.

502
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,739
l'll go ahead!

503
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:53,800
Kiddy!

504
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,070
Looks like we were a little too late.

505
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:02,170
No way!
Where's Katsumi?! 

506
00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:04,949
How should l know?
That selfish girl. 

507
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,000
l'll go check the other rooms
just in case. 

508
00:41:07,289 --> 00:41:09,219
Nami. Report to the Chief.

509
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,170
Katsumi...

510
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,969
l see. l understand.

511
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,500
l'm sorry that we weren't...

512
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,010
No, l know what they're after.

513
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,340
Go to the Bay City district
of area D-13 at once. 

514
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,849
Roger.

515
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:29,030
Chief.

516
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,679
l'll go there too.

517
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,480
How's your shoulder doing?

518
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:36,409
Well, my right shoulder's still
bothering me a bit, but... 

519
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,730
Very well.

520
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,659
l'll have Dewey go there.

521
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,110
l'll have you provide support from here.

522
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,610
Huh?

523
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:45,849
And l want you to use that system.

524
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:49,210
l understand.

525
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,309
l'll need 20 minutes to set and locate
the target, and to charge the machine. 

526
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,989
Thanks. l'm counting on you.

527
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,239
Don't mention it.
It's for a colleague...for a friend. 

528
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,840
Katsumi. Judge for yourself.

529
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:08,389
The meaning of battle...
and magic. 

530
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:46,800
Where am l?

531
00:42:56,369 --> 00:42:57,679
What is this?

532
00:42:58,599 --> 00:42:59,969
Are you awake?

533
00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:02,989
Why, that's right.

534
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:08,539
You do not know what happened here.

535
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:17,039
Watch closely...

536
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:20,820
...and regret living on forever.

537
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,070
Those are our friends who got stuck
within the warp of time-space... 

538
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:34,440
...when the gate to
Nemesis suddenly closed. 

539
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:37,849
Can't you hear them?

540
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:41,070
The voices of those who have awakened
after sensing your power. 

541
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,150
But they can't move.

542
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:50,239
They've been teasing the humans
by sending curses on the wind. 

543
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:54,420
But you know, if we have
your blood and power... 

544
00:43:54,989 --> 00:43:57,480
...our friends will be resurrected.

545
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:00,420
That listless expression
is good. 

546
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:04,840
That listlessness is something that
will be necessary for you from now on. 

547
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:09,539
lf you're gonna bear a grudge
against anyone... 

548
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:12,719
...bear one against your father
who gave you all of that. Do that, and... 

549
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:24,969
This gun is different from anything
in the past. 

550
00:44:25,389 --> 00:44:26,730
lt's the Graviton!

551
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:30,210
You keep getting in our way.

552
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,070
They're here to save me?

553
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,690
Katsumi!

554
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:39,920
Get away from there, quick!
You'll get caught in the blast! 

555
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,170
Katsumi!

556
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:55,800
NOOO! 

557
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,289
Katsumi, over here!

558
00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:06,699
Yuki!

559
00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:11,590
Are you all right? l'll bring it closer!

560
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:12,789
Dewey!

561
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:14,579
Yes, just a moment.

562
00:45:17,409 --> 00:45:18,340
Get in!

563
00:45:21,909 --> 00:45:22,929
Dewey, okay!

564
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,320
Fasten your seat belts.

565
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,929
Well done. Let's go, Nami.

566
00:45:32,159 --> 00:45:33,530
Lebia, you're good to go.

567
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:34,980
Okay, Kiddy.

568
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,170
Louie, have you located the target?

569
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,230
Already completed.

570
00:45:40,829 --> 00:45:43,110
We will begin our countdown.

571
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:44,590
Go ahead.

572
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,800
Ten seconds to go.
All clear. 

573
00:46:01,489 --> 00:46:03,800
Trigger timing to Miss Lebia.

574
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:05,239
Thank you.

575
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:06,630
Marker on!

576
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,610
The bridge is gone.

577
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,280
Yuki, why do something
so dangerous just to save me...? 

578
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:48,610
Because you're an important
friend of mine, Katsumi. It's only natural. 

579
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,650
Yuki...

580
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:05,750
Are you two all right?

581
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:09,409
No way!
They're still alive? 

582
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,510
How dare you do that to our friends.

583
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,309
Come to think of it
there's another. 

584
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,030
Yuki, run away, quick!

585
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:21,829
Katsumi.

586
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:24,239
Here...

587
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:31,260
Thank you, Yuki.

588
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,260
lt's an important item to you.

589
00:47:40,349 --> 00:47:42,519
Damn you...

590
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:57,099
Very well then.

591
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,280
lf you're eager to give up your life,
l'll take it for you. 

592
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,039
Damn it.

593
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:27,690
Kiddy!

594
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:29,480
Kiddy!

595
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:33,099
Nami, take those two and escape.

596
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,989
Hurry up. Nami, take them.

597
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,730
Right!

598
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:51,179
You're not getting away!
None of you! 

599
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:54,650
That person's body...

600
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,369
Now, hurry!

601
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:09,090
Kiddy!

602
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:13,860
Kiddy!

603
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,610
l will not forgive you,
after what you did to Kiddy! 

604
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:28,230
NO! 

605
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,719
Are you in pain, Katsumi?

606
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:37,409
But you must realize,
we've had to endure a lot more pain. 

607
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,420
Stop it!

608
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,500
l will not kill you, because
you are the all-important living key. 

609
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:49,559
First...

610
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,400
No way. The sacred water...

611
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,969
You shall see the end of those
who turned our friends into ashes. 

612
00:49:58,889 --> 00:50:00,590
Stop it! Stop it! 

613
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:08,900
Now, come to our world.

614
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:14,050
Why? Why is everyone helping me
at such a great cost? 

615
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,119
Wait! Don't take Katsumi!

616
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:24,659
Katsumi is an important friend of mine!

617
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,789
l...no, we all like Katsumi!

618
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,000
We need Katsumi!

619
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,469
So...so, don't take her!

620
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,670
Don't take Katsumi... 

621
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:41,380
Well, let's go.

622
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:49,090
Unfortunately, l've always
had a problem with giving up. 

623
00:50:49,570 --> 00:50:51,590
l'm not letting you take the princess.

624
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:55,019
Damn humans!

625
00:50:55,409 --> 00:50:57,840
You still insist on getting in our way?!

626
00:50:58,619 --> 00:50:59,489
That's right.

627
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:02,369
Katsumi's annoying,
but l kinda like her. 

628
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:11,340
This time l'll finish you off for sure.

629
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:12,769
Stop it!

630
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:20,150
Don't hurt my friends anymore!

631
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,329
You needn't be afraid of your powers.

632
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:26,460
All things in this world have
a spirit living within them. 

633
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,849
No way!

634
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:32,420
l hoped that you could live your life...

635
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:35,820
...peacefully and happily,
as an ordinary woman. But... 

636
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,679
Go, Katsumi'.
Go and fight with your fate. 

637
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:43,730
Dad...Mom...

638
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:46,349
Use your heart to communicate
with the spirits... 

639
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,719
...and give instructions on exerting power.

640
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,500
That's what magic is.

641
00:51:51,699 --> 00:51:55,179
You must become strong. Become strong
enough to protect the ones you love. 

642
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:58,780
Your father and l will be watching...forever...

643
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:04,309
There are people who say
that they like even a person like me. 

644
00:52:04,949 --> 00:52:06,650
People who need me.

645
00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:09,869
l wanna be able to love those people!

646
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:12,710
l wanna protect them,
using everything that l have! 

647
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,030
With the use of magic!

648
00:52:15,889 --> 00:52:18,519
So you're saying you won't come
to Nemesis with me? 

649
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:20,670
l won't go!

650
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,739
l will never again run away
from this real world! 

651
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,329
No matter what may happen!

652
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,780
l see. That's a shame!

653
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,860
The five stars of protection surround me
with their flame! 

654
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:35,389
The six stars of protection shimmer
in a pillar of light! 

655
00:52:35,949 --> 00:52:37,239
Mom, Dad...

656
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,670
Right now, l am about to willingly
use magic for the first time. 

657
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:44,030
The power to this barrier... ! Impossible!

658
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,110
The stream of my power...

659
00:52:47,429 --> 00:52:49,710
l can hear the voice of the spirits...

660
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:51,219
This is...

661
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:52,980
This is magic!

662
00:52:53,929 --> 00:52:56,389
This can't be happening.
This...power... 

663
00:52:57,269 --> 00:53:01,690
Ater marcto ve gepura ve dedura orum!

664
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:03,070
Amen!

665
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:12,320
Purify all evil within this light!

666
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:23,139
You will regret this, Katsumi.

667
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:28,679
l did it, Mom.

668
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,730
l defeated the Lucifer Hawk.

669
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:36,920
l protected my friends...

670
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,750
...with magic.

671
00:54:01,969 --> 00:54:04,110
Mom, l'll be on my way.

672
00:54:07,469 --> 00:54:09,079
Net open to normal police!

673
00:54:09,369 --> 00:54:12,909
As of nineteen hours and thirteen minutes
this is now a category three case... 

674
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,349
...classified as a Third Attraction.

675
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:17,440
Present situation, rank C.

676
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:19,579
This case is now under
AMP's command. 

677
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:24,460
To my front...Raphael.

678
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,340
To my rear...Gabriel.

679
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,059
To my right hand, Michael.

680
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:30,059
And to my left hand, Uriel.

681
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,579
Ater marcto ve gepura ve
dedura orum! Amen! 

682
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:38,300
Did she get it?

683
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,780
l almost had it.
Kiddy, the Graviton! 

684
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:55,739
Katsumi.
You still have a ways to go. 

685
00:54:58,059 --> 00:54:59,900
l'm just getting started.
Just watch me. 

686
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,980
A heartbreaking night is coming

687
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:17,170
To a place that overlooks the city

688
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:24,000
Unable to trust each other
after two thousand years 

689
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:31,309
Why do people still welcome tomorrow?

690
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:37,260
The swirling winds are murmuring

691
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:45,500
lt sounds like a nostalgic voice

692
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:52,070
Sleep now,
you will surely meet them in the morning 

693
00:55:53,480 --> 00:56:00,219
lf you are willing to love someone

694
00:56:01,989 --> 00:56:07,760
Battles are always for oneself, ah

695
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:14,079
They are not for hurting others

696
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:21,880
Even though l was so depressed, ah

697
00:56:23,269 --> 00:56:28,219
l was able to refrain from running away

698
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,940
Because l came to know you

699
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,610
(PICTURE)

700
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:48,480
(PICTURE)

701
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:18,530
Battles are always for oneself, ah

702
00:57:19,929 --> 00:57:25,230
They are not for hurting others

703
00:57:26,909 --> 00:57:32,710
Wiping a tear somewhere on Earth, ah

704
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:39,269
Hoping this will somehow reach a friend

705
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,539
