1
00:00:21,978 --> 00:00:24,067
It's over.

2
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:26,591
We did it, he's dead.

3
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:34,034
You
thought it was over.

4
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:39,126
You were wrong.

5
00:00:40,562 --> 00:00:43,217
Hackley, he moves like a shadow.

6
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:52,400
Never runs, never makes a sound.

7
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:59,798
Don't be scared, don't
be frightened,

8
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:01,844
be completely terrified.

9
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:12,115
Hackley's reign of terror
will never end.

10
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,771
♪ But those who do, it's time
to make your voice heard ♪

11
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,512
There's
just no stopping Hackley.

12
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:24,649
From the director of The
Rancid Terror and Yell II,

13
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:26,869
Blood Lines.

14
00:01:30,002 --> 00:01:31,482
Coming Fall, 1985.

15
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:35,878
Hackley is back.

16
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:53,461
Oh shit!

17
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,029
Help!

18
00:01:57,073 --> 00:01:58,335
- Help, help me!
- Run, run!

19
00:01:58,379 --> 00:01:59,815
Please, let me go!

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,735
Run!

21
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:21,663
- Is he still back there?

22
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:26,146
Yep.

23
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,452
- I wanna get a selfie.

24
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,759
- Are you serious?
- Yeah,

25
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:32,804
it's kinda fun.

26
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,154
And, oh, there he is,

27
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:35,067
- Stop.
- He's kinda

28
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:37,157
- Switch, come on.
- Fine.

29
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:42,118
Can we please stop?
- Look, just don't take

30
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,990
your eyes off of him and
we'll be fine.

31
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:47,471
How long have
we been at this now?

32
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:49,952
13 fucking hours.

33
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,828
I've never been so glad
to kill somebody

34
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:59,048
in my entire fucking life.

35
00:03:02,965 --> 00:03:06,186
I'm definitely bringing this
shit up with my manager.

36
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,871
My therapist thinks
I've got too much

37
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:09,221
pent-up anger and frustration.

38
00:05:09,265 --> 00:05:10,484
Well, I mean, what do you
want me to do about it?

39
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,007
That's what I'm seeing you for.

40
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,097
And he's like, I don't know,
you could write a journal.

41
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,014
This is the 21st century,
nobody does that anymore.

42
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:22,104
What everybody does
is they blog.

43
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:22,974
Here I am.

44
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,847
I hate my job.

45
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:30,504
Now, don't get me wrong, I
love what I do.

46
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:33,637
I hate my bosses, my
cubicle, and what's worse,

47
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:36,031
the mountains of red
tape I gotta go through.

48
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:39,295
We are just bogged down
with status report

49
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,775
after status report.

50
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,385
And then in-between the
status reports,

51
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:43,865
we gotta have a status meeting.

52
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:45,040
You would think that once

53
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,998
you've reached my level
of seniority,

54
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,261
that the only things
I'd have to worry about

55
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:52,221
are attack dogs,
FBI's most wanted,

56
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:56,530
guys like Donald Pleasance,
but no.

57
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:01,186
I have to write status reports.

58
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:19,944
Status meeting!

59
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:29,911
Hello all, we've got a
lot to go over, ya hosers,

60
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:31,173
so settle down.

61
00:06:32,957 --> 00:06:35,612
My manager.

62
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:36,961
You know, his status meetings

63
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:40,138
are apparently always
so important,

64
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:43,359
yet not important enough for
him to get there on time.

65
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,708
Did everyone
have a chance to look over

66
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:47,537
the new rules that we
passed out last week?

67
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:51,367
There is some important
stuff in here.

68
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,065
Alright, well, since
this is a status meeting,

69
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:56,372
let's go around the room and
get everybody's statuses.

70
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,982
Rancid?

71
00:06:58,026 --> 00:06:59,157
Oh yeah, I
forgot to tell you.

72
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:00,855
He's, ah, he's dead.

73
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,206
He's gonna be a little late.

74
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:06,904
Guys, if
you're gonna be late,

75
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:09,124
I'm gonna need you to
send me an email.

76
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,605
Well, that's a
little hard when you're dead

77
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:14,477
and in a box six feet
under the ground.

78
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:17,175
You don't get real
good reception.

79
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:21,136
Hyde,
how's the thing

80
00:07:21,179 --> 00:07:22,572
you're working on going?

81
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:24,835
Yeah, well,
hey, before you get started,

82
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,489
I got a couple things I wanted

83
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:30,319
to talk you about like this
whole no running thing.

84
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:32,408
No, no, no, no,
no, this is a status meeting.

85
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,758
We do not talk about rule
changes at a status meeting.

86
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:35,846
But they're stupid,

87
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,848
we, we need to
address these rules.

88
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:40,982
It's a
status meeting.

89
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:44,028
Now, what's your status?

90
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:53,298
I spent half a
day following these girls,

91
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:54,691
and I can't actually kill 'em

92
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:57,520
'cause one of them was
turned around looking at me,

93
00:07:57,564 --> 00:08:00,610
which is another one of
your stupid rules.

94
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:05,528
So I had a little trouble killing them in a timely fashion.

95
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,444
Obviously,
I'm not very happy

96
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,837
with your performance.

97
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,621
We are going to have to put you

98
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:14,711
on a performance
improvement plan.

99
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:16,539
What?

100
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:19,150
No, no, no, no, I've been
here 30 years, alright?

101
00:08:19,194 --> 00:08:21,283
I'm in a company commercial.

102
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:22,937
A PIP, me?

103
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,720
You're not
getting fired.

104
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:24,895
We're not mad at you.

105
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,158
We just wanna help get ya
back on track.

106
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:29,117
Have you even been
in the field for 20 years?

107
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,553
I mean, no, you don't even know

108
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,381
what it's like out there, man.

109
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:35,079
These rules, they don't
work anymore.

110
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:39,562
Nobody can kill effectively
with this kind of limitation.

111
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:42,260
Rival,
what's your status?

112
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:44,828
I killed 17
people this week.

113
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:49,529
Six stoners, three sluts,
about a dozen total assholes.

114
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:52,401
Also, I took out Kris Kringle,

115
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:54,490
that drunken,
mean-spirited mall Santa.

116
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,839
Used to work for
Killers Unlimited.

117
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:57,580
You got a
Clash of the Titans kill?

118
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:58,755
Yeah, I gutted
him real good.

119
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,235
You know, my bare
hands just reached

120
00:09:00,278 --> 00:09:01,845
in there and pulled his
intestines out,

121
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:04,456
and wrapped 'em around the
Christmas tree like tinsel.

122
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,936
Alright.

123
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,677
That mall will never
be the same.

124
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:08,809
Great work,

125
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:11,376
and did you happen to
have to break

126
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,597
any company policies to
get that done?

127
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:15,859
No, I did not.

128
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:17,469
Hmm.

129
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:19,167
- Lucky.
- Well, Asparagus?

130
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:25,173
- Ah, I, this week, um, got
new hangers for my closet.

131
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,614
Well,
great work.

132
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,442
Okay, we've all gone

133
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:34,748
over our statuses, right?

134
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,140
We've taken care of
that order of business.

135
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:38,665
So do you think maybe now
we can discuss

136
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,623
and brainstorm some of
these company policies?

137
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,494
This is a
status meeting!

138
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:43,844
But we've got
the conference meeting

139
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:45,062
for another...

140
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:47,587
Fine.

141
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,023
Great, so
being the last

142
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:50,459
status meeting of the month,

143
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:53,244
it's time for

144
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:55,986
Employee of the Month!

145
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,728
And I think it comes
to no surprise

146
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:01,557
that RKS's Employee
of the Month,

147
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:04,516
Rival!

148
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,780
Congratulations.
- Yay, Rival!

149
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:09,478
Yeah!

150
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:11,872
Woo!

151
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,049
So, thank
you all for attending.

152
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:17,399
Hackley, please come see
me when you have a moment,

153
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:21,011
so we can talk about your
performance improvement plan.

154
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,143
Okay?

155
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:24,232
Great work guys.

156
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:06,753
- Ah, morning buddy.

157
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:10,104
Hey, Rancid,
what you got there,

158
00:11:10,147 --> 00:11:12,410
a little resurrection
goo or whatever?

159
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,412
- You know it.

160
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:16,458
I don't why you
use those wipes still, man.

161
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:17,546
They changed the formula.

162
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:19,287
It's like totally
biodegradable now.

163
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,244
In fact, it tastes like
- Really?

164
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,376
- pineapple.
- Really?

165
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,030
Yeah, I
just lick it off.

166
00:11:23,073 --> 00:11:23,944
- Hmm, really?
- Make a pina coloda

167
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:24,858
out of it.

168
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,950
What?
- That taste like semen.

169
00:11:29,993 --> 00:11:32,430
Pretty good, huh?

170
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,129
Dumb ass.

171
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:35,999
- Asshole.

172
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:41,222
So, how was the, ah, the
meeting this morning, huh?

173
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:42,614
Yeah, just be
glad you weren't there.

174
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:43,703
That was the most boring--

175
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,008
- That's what I figured.
- Yeah.

176
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:47,794
- You know, I, ah, I got
myself killed last night

177
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:49,926
on purpose so I
wouldn't have to go.

178
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:51,232
Good thinking.

179
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,276
- Mm-hmm.
- I should have thought

180
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,279
of that myself.
- My office!

181
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:56,846
Five minutes, Hackley.

182
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:00,284
- Good morning, chief.
- Put your mask on.

183
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:07,683
Hold on, there we go.

184
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,685
One sec, alright.

185
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,295
I'm stuck, it's--
- Come on.

186
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,689
Let's show a little
professionalism.

187
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,299
Alright.

188
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,608
Professionalism.

189
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:21,828
What's his problem?

190
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:23,786
Yeah, I kinda
got put on plan.

191
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,700
Don't laugh.

192
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:29,270
What did I just say?

193
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:31,315
So what's El
Jefe going to make you do

194
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,535
for your performance
improvement plan?

195
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:35,493
That I,
I don't know.

196
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:37,191
My boss, El Matodor.

197
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,021
From Canada.

198
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:42,936
Makes sense, doesn't it?

199
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:46,809
You know, they say that
those who can't,

200
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:47,767
they teach.

201
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:52,554
Well, those who can't and
are also morons,

202
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:56,688
ah, they get stuck in
middle management.

203
00:12:56,732 --> 00:12:58,821
His whole life, he
wanted to integrate

204
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:00,257
his national heritage

205
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:02,999
into his whole serial
killer shtick.

206
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,696
And right when he's
about to unleash

207
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,569
his new Canadian
inspired costume,

208
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:10,659
this other guy comes
out with one

209
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:12,835
that's almost exactly the same.

210
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,490
He's got no time, he's running
around at the last minute,

211
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:17,579
and he goes with the
Mexican theme.

212
00:13:17,622 --> 00:13:21,017
And after 30 years, he
has never let it go.

213
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:23,715
What's the big
deal with the hockey mask,

214
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,804
anyway?

215
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:27,502
I mean, that hoser,
mongoloid retard

216
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:29,547
isn't even from some place cold.

217
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,723
He's from Mississippi.

218
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,725
He's never even been to
a hockey game.

219
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,684
I'm from Saskatchewan.

220
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:37,817
I've been wearing a hockey
mask ever since I was born.

221
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,688
It just really gets my goat,
you know?

222
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:42,647
- Yeah, goats.
- So, you're on plan.

223
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,955
And we're gonna lay out
clear expectations

224
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,000
and give you a task

225
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:48,088
to get you off of plan.
- What?

226
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:49,263
This is stupid, man.

227
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:50,960
This is asinine.
- Don't get an attitude

228
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,135
with me, eh, you're only

229
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,790
in this situation because
of your actions.

230
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,792
And this task will help
you get on track

231
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,012
so that everybody's happy.

232
00:13:59,055 --> 00:14:00,752
Alright,
look, can just give me my,

233
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,232
I don't know, Lassie Tasks,

234
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:04,974
so I can get back to play,
I mean to work.

235
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:05,845
Don't
think I don't know what

236
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,063
you mean by that, eh.

237
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:09,022
You're gonna take these
tasks seriously.

238
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:11,676
Lassie Tasks.

239
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,157
We call them that
because management

240
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:17,378
tries to talk 'em up and
make 'em look all heroic,

241
00:14:17,421 --> 00:14:19,423
but everybody knows he
just a bitch.

242
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,121
And all of that stuff
that involves,

243
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:23,297
you know, all of that
workhorse stuff.

244
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,865
Basically anything that has
nothing to do with killing,

245
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,736
that's not for us,
that's for the new guys.

246
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:29,694
Hyde is
going to kill

247
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,696
a whole bunch of kids
at a fat camp.

248
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,264
We nee you to Molly Maid
it and then you,

249
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:35,744
no, no, no, no, not that one.

250
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:38,094
- Being a Molly Maid.

251
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:40,967
- Hackley was here and
he killed all my friends.

252
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,185
- Hack--
- There were bodies

253
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:43,491
everywhere.

254
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:47,016
- Listen, Hackley's been
dead for weeks, okay.

255
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,409
I think we're gonna have
to take you into custody.

256
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,802
- Can't you smell the Lysol?

257
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:52,500
- Yeah, we're gonna go.

258
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:58,375
Rival
needs someone

259
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,595
to cue up his theme music.

260
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,947
Ah, Schindler's List?

261
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:08,646
And then
there's Schindler's Listing.

262
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,171
It's where you put 'em
on a live list

263
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:13,434
and there's a die list.

264
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:16,045
That task is actually not
that, it's not that bad.

265
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,961
Unless you're Schindler's
Listing a Jewish guy.

266
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:21,224
In which case you start
thinking about Nazis,

267
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:24,314
and you know, you kind
of feel like a dick.

268
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,577
Especially when you put
'em on the die list.

269
00:15:26,621 --> 00:15:31,234
A blonde, a cut blonde girl.

270
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:33,715
Danielle Peckham,
sheriff's daughter.

271
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:34,846
Check it out.

272
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:42,332
If our cast can't
find a reason to kill you,

273
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:43,855
you become a free agent.

274
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:46,641
Who would you like to see
pick up your contract?

275
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:49,774
- You know, I'd be honored by
any of those big companies.

276
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:51,037
Would love to see Grizzle.

277
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,430
I've been a big fan of his
work for years.

278
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,998
LK Limited had the kill
rates to me before RKS,

279
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,739
and they always kept
stuff interesting,

280
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:59,654
so it'd be an honor for
any one of those.

281
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:01,047
Yeah, okay,
look, I know the drill,

282
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,136
but, um, I don't like the
way we're doing things.

283
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,356
I have to spend all this
time casing the joint.

284
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,662
We could just kill her.

285
00:16:07,705 --> 00:16:09,272
Can you imagine how
ballsy that would look?

286
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:10,317
We're not even worrying about

287
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,057
whether or not she's
a good girl,

288
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,362
we just kill her.

289
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,102
She's a good girl, you
know what I'm saying?

290
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:14,582
Think about the headline

291
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:19,369
Man, it would be like, look,
anyone could be a victim.

292
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:20,196
No.

293
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,328
Hackley, that's dumb.

294
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:23,199
We, we can't go off
company handbook.

295
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:24,940
We have these things
for a reason.

296
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,333
No, we don't.

297
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,465
Dude, the only reason
that we have that handbook

298
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:30,163
is because a bunch of
suits sit around

299
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,425
in some office somewhere,

300
00:16:31,468 --> 00:16:33,644
we don't even know where
it is, and they like

301
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:34,515
just sit to justify
- no, look, this.

302
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:35,298
their existence.

303
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:36,473
They just make a bunch of

304
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:37,779
corporate pol--
- Whoa there, slow down.

305
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:39,563
This policy is very
important to me,

306
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,435
so I want you to follow it.

307
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:43,698
This happens to be
integral and very important

308
00:16:43,741 --> 00:16:45,700
to the credibility of
our organization.

309
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:47,049
Important?

310
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,486
You made that policy,
didn't you?

311
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,879
That's yours.

312
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:53,142
It don't
matter none who wrote it.

313
00:16:53,186 --> 00:16:55,927
Also, we've got an intern
starting next week.

314
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,451
I want you to take him
under your wing,

315
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:59,888
and when you're done
with your Lassie,

316
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,195
special tasks, show
him the ropes.

317
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,197
Oh, no.

318
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,158
So, I've got
your girl's address right here.

319
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:10,420
Take it.

320
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,337
Let me know if you have it.

321
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:15,251
- Okay.
- You're gonna need this

322
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,383
address to find her.

323
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:18,080
- So please--
- Photographic memory.

324
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:19,429
Remember?

325
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:22,650
Call me if
you have any questions.

326
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:26,045
Adios.

327
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,483
- Hey, you busy?
- No.

328
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:33,052
So, what's your Lassie Task?

329
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:36,794
I'm, I'm
Schindler's Listing this chick.

330
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:37,795
- Oh.
- Yeah, you wanna

331
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,362
get some coffee and come along?

332
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:40,407
Yeah.

333
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,062
Oh, shit.

334
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,237
Don't look.

335
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,629
Shit.

336
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:49,111
- Hey, friends.

337
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:52,680
Hey, Asparagus.

338
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:56,727
You ever have that one
guy at your job, you know,

339
00:17:57,772 --> 00:18:00,166
you're not really
sure what he does

340
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:02,646
or how he even stays employed?

341
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,561
Well, ours is Asparagus.

342
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:08,739
I don't he's killed a
single person.

343
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:12,134
I think he's kinda like this
special outreach or something,

344
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:13,614
but they're not telling us.

345
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:17,226
- Ah, can I, can I,
ah, ask you a question?

346
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,795
Sure.

347
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:25,669
- Thanks.

348
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:35,940
Your car or mine?

349
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:40,031
Ah, it's your
assignment, you drive.

350
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,946
Then, I take the bag of weed,

351
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,426
and I shove it in his mouth

352
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,906
and I ligth the whole
damn thing on fire.

353
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:46,690
Poof!

354
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:48,039
Nice, I
haven't done anything fun

355
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,389
like that in years, man.

356
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:52,087
Not since they put those
proposed guideline,

357
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,437
13 rules into effect
or whatever.

358
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,961
More of that bullshit
I'm talking about, man.

359
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:00,313
What do you want?

360
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,793
Um, low fat latte.

361
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:06,623
Could I get
a low fat latte

362
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:11,193
and whatever, that thing
right there on the menu.

363
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:13,848
Yeah, that thing.

364
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:24,728
You know they're gonna make you

365
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:27,209
fill out 1048 form
for that PG13,

366
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:28,819
Mary Jane kill, right?

367
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:31,431
- No.
- Why not? Why not?

368
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:32,823
I mean, they make me
fill it out.

369
00:19:32,867 --> 00:19:34,042
How come I have to do
this paperwork

370
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:35,522
and you get off for free?

371
00:19:35,565 --> 00:19:40,222
'Cause me and El
Bosso are cool like that.

372
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,093
Thank you.

373
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:45,749
Whoa, ah?

374
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,406
Ah, dude, can
you get some extra napkins?

375
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,103
This guy in the back's
getting crap all over me.

376
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:54,932
Yeah, yeah, can
we get some extra napkins?

377
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:58,719
Thank you much.

378
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:03,506
Thank you.

379
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:06,553
Thank you.

380
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:10,078
♪ One, two, three, four

381
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:33,057
So, how do
you avoid doing

382
00:20:33,101 --> 00:20:35,321
all of that paperwork, man?

383
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,237
I get in good
with the boss.

384
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,979
It's like, you know, playing
fantasy football late together,

385
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:43,981
we go shoot pool from
time to time.

386
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,244
I gave him one of
those cheerleaders

387
00:20:45,287 --> 00:20:48,551
from the old football
massacre last year.

388
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:49,900
- Oh, yeah?
- He's not gonna fire me.

389
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:51,989
It's like, we don't pay wages

390
00:20:52,033 --> 00:20:53,339
like any of the other
companies in town.

391
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:54,601
You know?
- Mm-hmm.

392
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:55,906
So I take
care of the big stuff,

393
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,648
and he doesn't sweat
the small stuff.

394
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:00,302
Why doesn't he
do that shit with me, man?

395
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,609
I mean, I've been at this
company longer than anybody.

396
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:04,001
I got 15 company records.

397
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:05,481
Because you're
a dick to him.

398
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,744
15, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I'm a dick, okay.

399
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:09,137
Technically you're right.

400
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,748
But yeah, okay, I'm not
gonna stop being a dick

401
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:14,838
just to get out of paperwork.

402
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:16,231
So who killed you last night?

403
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,016
Oh, this
really hot chick.

404
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,583
A chick so hot you'd be like,

405
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:22,629
oh, there's no way she could
keep guys out of her pants.

406
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:24,500
But she does.
- Man.

407
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:25,632
And I get taken out.

408
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:26,720
- That sucks.
- Better than

409
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:27,895
fucking last month.

410
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:29,157
This real like nerdy kid

411
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,985
with all these nerdy
stereotypes, you know,

412
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:33,466
like glasses and shit.

413
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,858
- Fair fight.
- Suck my dick.

414
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,207
I couldn't have taken
that kid that one time

415
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:37,600
since they cut off both
of my arms, you know?

416
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:38,688
- Mm-hmm.
- But I just have

417
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:39,950
to sit there and take it.

418
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:41,474
Yeah, I
know what you mean, man.

419
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:43,998
My worst one is this little
eight year old kid, right.

420
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,391
He's coming down the stairs

421
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:47,306
and I'm gonna get ready
to just let him kill me

422
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,568
because of the rules,

423
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:50,309
but I notice he has shaved
all of his hair

424
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,440
on his whole body.

425
00:21:51,484 --> 00:21:52,398
- Whole body?
- Yeah, well,

426
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:53,703
on his head at least.

427
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,139
Maybe he didn't have
hair anywhere else yet.

428
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:56,315
- Sure.
- But not just that,

429
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,578
he was wearing these like tiny,
little

430
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:02,190
daisy duke looking shorts
on his little chicken legs.

431
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:03,626
He's, he's got the moxie, right?

432
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,411
Like he's trying to
act all tough.

433
00:22:05,454 --> 00:22:06,934
Where I'm almost pissed
myself laughing

434
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:08,892
was he tried to like
run me through

435
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:10,938
with his little, his
little grubby hands

436
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:13,332
on that little cutlass he
had from a toy set, man.

437
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,463
It wasn't even funny.

438
00:22:14,507 --> 00:22:15,551
I think it was Pirates
of the Caribbean

439
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:16,813
or something like that.

440
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:18,380
I never got
that company policy.

441
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:20,687
Oh, yeah,
that's, that's retarded.

442
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,818
Where is this chick,
anyways?

443
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:23,516
Oh, you know,

444
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,866
I'm sorry, I didn't call
her and let her know

445
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:27,998
that we were gonna be
sitting here stalking her

446
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:29,609
and casing her, you know,
just in case

447
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:34,222
we wanna cut her head off.

448
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,052
Well, ah, actually, on
that note man,

449
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:39,967
be a little serious,
I've been thinking about

450
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,751
getting a new job.

451
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:44,537
I'm just tired of all
the bullshit around here.

452
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,234
You know there's
bullshit everywhere, right?

453
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:47,409
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
but at least

454
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:49,629
it would be new bullshit, right?

455
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:51,500
And so then you're in that,
you know,

456
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:53,067
you don't even know
it's bullshit

457
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,374
for a good several months,

458
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,331
and so you're kinda sitting

459
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,854
in that blissful ignorance

460
00:22:57,898 --> 00:23:01,249
where you don't even
realize how much like sucks.

461
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,729
So what
brought this on?

462
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:06,689
Ah, you, nothing,
nothing, nothing at all.

463
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,299
Want some coffee?

464
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:10,389
Rival got employee
of the month again today.

465
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,564
How come
they haven't

466
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,740
given that to me once?

467
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:17,004
I mean, I've got 15
company records.

468
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:18,962
Same reason,
you're a dick.

469
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:20,921
But I
owned the 80's.

470
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:22,575
And I owned the 90's, alright?

471
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:25,360
And he just sits there with his,
you now,

472
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,146
stupid mask on, polishing
his stupid trophies

473
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,845
with a stupid name
that doesn't even

474
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:33,368
go with serial killer.

475
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,978
I mean, Rival? Are you serious?

476
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:38,460
What was he, was he like
the guy in Karate Kid 2?

477
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:40,897
I think
someone needs tacos.

478
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:44,684

that he can take a seven
foot nine basketball player

and kill him with a pump

00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:13,103

a basketball.

495
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:15,149
It's obviously bullshit.

496
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,936
Oh, oh, that might be her.

497
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:26,508
What, what
she's, ah, what she's doing?

498
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:29,380
It looks
like laundry.

499
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:31,687
Oh, shit.
- What?

500
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,083
What dude?
- Really?

501
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:37,606
Oh, man.
- What's she doing?

502
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,607
- Oh, yeah.
- She's not

503
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:40,522
in the shower, is she?
- Mm-hmm.

504
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,524
She's in the
fucking shower?

505
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:45,179
Oh, goddammit, I can't.
- No, no, no, no.

506
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:46,310
I can't
just sit in this

507
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:47,486
car while there's a hot
- You can't.

508
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,009
- girl in the shower.
- Look, we cannot

509
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:50,010
just go kill her.

510
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:52,099
First, we have to case the joint

511
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:53,796
as if we were going to kill her.

512
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,624
There is a
hot girl in the shower.

513
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:57,147
I can't not kill her.

514
00:24:57,191 --> 00:24:58,627
I, I hear you.

515
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:00,803
I understand, I mean, look,
I'm wearing a mask too.

516
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:03,545
I wanna go over there
and cut her head off.

517
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:04,764
It's a, it's a hot naked girl.

518
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,156
I'm with you, man.
- In the shower.

519
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,377
Yeah, but
it's the bullshit.

520
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,511
It's the bullshit I was
talking about.

521
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,861
Although, you wanna go kill

522
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:18,038
some awkward World of
Warcraft players?

523
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,169
We can kill them.

524
00:25:19,213 --> 00:25:20,780
Some people ask me,

525
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:23,739
where'd you get your costume?

526
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:26,220
You know, it was one of
those throwaway things

527
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:27,830
that was just laying
in my closet.

528
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:29,266
I think my grandma gave me,

529
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,833
I never really wore it.

530
00:25:30,877 --> 00:25:32,879
So I decided to do
this focus group

531
00:25:32,922 --> 00:25:34,707
and they came up with the apron.

532
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,535
I just kinda splashed
blood on it,

533
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:39,233
and, I don't know, it
just kinda looked

534
00:25:39,276 --> 00:25:42,497
like I made brisket
out of the Brady Bunch.

535
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,544
We don't use real blood anymore.

536
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,849
You probably didn't know this

537
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:48,982
but blood, when it dries,

538
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:52,159
it turns brown.

539
00:25:52,202 --> 00:25:53,247
With that blood, it
would look like

540
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,988
somebody just went and smeared

541
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:57,251
a whole bunch of doo-doo on me.

542
00:25:57,294 --> 00:26:00,167
And not only does it
look like poop.

543
00:26:09,829 --> 00:26:11,221
Yeah.

544
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:12,440
- I love this.

545
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:16,183
- Oh, yeah.

546
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:20,709
You okay?

547
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:22,711
- Ah, what's that smell?

548
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:26,672
Don't worry about it.

549
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:27,847
- It's really bad.

550
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,065
- Is it me?

551
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:30,371
I, I showered today.

552
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:34,680
- No, it's, I don't even
know where it's coming from.

553
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:36,638
Here, just take
your mind off it.

554
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:39,598
- No, I can't.

555
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:42,122
I, I can't lose
- What?

556
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,732
- my virginity this way.

557
00:26:43,776 --> 00:26:44,646
I can't.
- What?

558
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,996
- Scott, I, put me down now.

559
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:50,391
- Joanie, Joanie?
- Gross.

560
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:55,352
- I don't smell anything.

561
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:00,967
That kinda
bullshit can seriously cut

562
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,404
into a man's productivity.

563
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:06,755
- Hello?

564
00:27:09,802 --> 00:27:13,022
Asparagus, how many times
have we gone over this?

565
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,546
Your life insurance policy

566
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,767
does not cover you
every time you die.

567
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:19,507
Is that clear?

568
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,772
I cannot seem
to get anyone scared of me.

569
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:26,122
Yeah, everyone's scared
once you hack

570
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,647
their legs off with
garden shears,

571
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,345
but with you, you just
walk into a room

572
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:33,652
and everyone runs screaming.

573
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,610
- Yeah, uh-huh.
- Me?

574
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,613
I walk in, everyone just stares.

575
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,181
What is it that you're
doing that I'm not doing?

576
00:27:41,224 --> 00:27:42,704
Is there any like a thing?

577
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:44,663
You got that ax thing.

578
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,534
Yeah, yeah,
you know,

579
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:50,756
um, you know these things,
they just take time.

580
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,975
I mean, look at me, I
didn't become

581
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:56,326
a legendary killer overnight,
right?

582
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,024
Maybe you just need a
few big kills

583
00:27:58,067 --> 00:28:02,376
and, you know, you'll be just
as scary as the rest of us.

584
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:03,377
You know?
- So you're saying

585
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,595
I do need an ax?

586
00:28:04,639 --> 00:28:05,945
Or is it this outfit?

587
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:08,295
I need a new outfit?
- No, no, no, no.

588
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:12,299
Please do not change
anything about this outfit.

589
00:28:12,342 --> 00:28:13,822
This is, this is not
the problem.

590
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:14,693
Trust me.

591
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,044
It's just gonna take
time to find your thing.

592
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:21,090
Yeah, maybe
you're right.

593
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:26,008
Oh, hey there.

594
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:27,140
Hey, Hackley.

595
00:28:47,682 --> 00:28:49,989
Hmm, Hackley, hey, hey.
- Oh.

596
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:52,774
Your new
intern is here.

597
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:54,167
Hey, boss.

598
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:54,994
Ah, come on down

599
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:56,256
Ah, we're right here.

600
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:57,910
Ah, here, have a seat.

601
00:28:57,953 --> 00:28:59,041
Ah, right there.

602
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,303
Okay.

603
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:03,654
Now, Hackley, um, this
is Mitre-Saw,

604
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:05,004
Mitre-Saw, this is Hackley.

605
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:09,356
Ah, you two get acquainted
and you kids have fun.

606
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:10,400
Okay?

607
00:29:10,444 --> 00:29:11,271
Okay.

608
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,187
Woo.

609
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:19,105
- Hey.
- Hello.

610
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:20,846
Look, the first
thing we're gonna need to do

611
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,021
is, yeah, let's get you a mask.

612
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:23,152
- No mask.

613
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:24,545
What do you mean,
no mask?

614
00:29:24,588 --> 00:29:27,940
- I want my victims to look
upon me and see frailty.

615
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,290
A life past its prime.

616
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:34,381
One to make them realize how
much they're wasting theirs.

617
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:38,602
Okay, look, I
see what you're trying to do.

618
00:29:38,646 --> 00:29:41,518
It's cute but we all wear masks.

619
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:43,303
That's just, you know, basics.

620
00:29:43,346 --> 00:29:45,827
You see that guy back there?

621
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:52,921
That's the kind of guy
who doesn't wear a mask.

622
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:00,320
Yeah.

623
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:05,368
Look, um, I gotta go
do this thing,

624
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:06,456
so I'm gonna be a while,

625
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,328
but I tell you what,
later you and I,

626
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,983
we're gonna go out and I'm
gonna show you the ropes.

627
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,071
- Ow.

628
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:13,159
What do you mean,
ow?

629
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:14,595
- I'm ill.

630
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:17,424
My disease has spread
throughout leaving me weak.

631
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:20,253
Ew, what
kind of disease?

632
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:21,471
- Cancer.
- Oh.

633
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,431
- And diptheria.
- Oh.

634
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:27,129
- And consumption.
- Wow.

635
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:32,918
- And lupus sometimes when,
whenever it gets cold.

636
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,223
Alright, I
tell you what,

637
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,747
you go ahead and get some sleep.

638
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,315
Conserve your strength,
if you die,

639
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,490
go ahead and give me a call.

640
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:43,102
Otherwise I will see you later.

641
00:30:44,103 --> 00:30:44,930
And, yeah.

642
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:55,157
I've been getting really,
really angry lately.

643
00:30:58,073 --> 00:30:59,509
My therapist says I
have what's called

644
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:01,816
an impulse control problem.

645
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:09,824
Hey, that was tea.

646
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:38,853
I have to remind my therapist,

647
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,682
of course I have an
impulse control problem,

648
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:42,988
I'm a serial killer.

649
00:31:44,206 --> 00:31:45,512
And
that's why we've started

650
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:47,818
asking survivors to fill
out this survey,

651
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:49,298
so that we can become
better killers.

652
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:03,312
So how exactly

653
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,880
can you be an effective killer

654
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,926
when you're all weak
and cancery?

655
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:09,231
- Staring death in the face

656
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:13,453
has left me callous to
laws and life itself.

657
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:15,281
Combined with my
superior intellect,

658
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:17,587
I shall prove to be a
menacing presence.

659
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:20,677
Look, I don't
mean to be, you know,

660
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:23,289
insensitive to your whole
condition and everything,

661
00:32:23,332 --> 00:32:25,769
but I'm a little concerned
about your ability

662
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:27,119
to perform at this point.

663
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:28,859
Can you even lift a chainsaw?

664
00:32:28,903 --> 00:32:31,601
- I think not in terms
of such simple devices

665
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:33,255
to inflict my damage.

666
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,605
My instruments shall
display a complexity

667
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:38,304
to mirror my own
inner-complexity.

668
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:42,134
So, a
double chainsaw?

669
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,708
That's our mark.

670
00:32:51,752 --> 00:32:53,449
Alright, we're almost up here.

671
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:56,061
Here, take a look for yourself.

672
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,324
Or not.

673
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,152
Look, you just sit there,
alright,

674
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:02,415
and I'm gonna show you
how a pro does it.

675
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,634
A seasoned veteran in the house.

676
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,754
Did you see that?

677
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:40,366
I picked her up and then
I bludgeoned her

678
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:42,455
to death with here
own egg beater.

679
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:43,934
- It was flawed.

680
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:45,675
She had not time to think.

681
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:46,850
To grow.

682
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:47,938
For redemption.

683
00:33:47,982 --> 00:33:49,940
Yeah, of course not,
man.

684
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,072
We, we kill them.

685
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:51,942
That's all we do.

686
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:54,206
We're not therapists, okay?

687
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:58,036
Are you even listening to me?

688
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,820
- The world doesn't exist solely

689
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:02,083
in shades of black and white,

690
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:03,867
good and evil, as you see it.

691
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:06,174
People live in varying
shades of gray.

692
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:08,089
No, no, you
don't understand.

693
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:13,007
Look, we separate people
into good guys and bad guys.

694
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,097
Right? And then we kill
the bad guys.

695
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:17,881
- Go here.

696
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:21,624
Okay.

697
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:25,193
Ah, well, we're done
here so might as well.

Where are we?

708
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,608
Okay.

709
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:49,826
Which one? Oh.

710
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:52,090
Oh.

711
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:55,745
What is that contraption
you got him in?

712
00:34:55,789 --> 00:34:58,661
- It is a device of my
own creation.

713
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:01,055
That man, on the surface,

714
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,491
is one of your good men.

715
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:05,103
He's a teacher but in the
remaining hours of his day,

716
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,888
he escapes into a
digital online world.

717
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:12,719
Now, he must play a game to
spare the rest of his life.

718
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:14,068
How did you
even get him in that?

719
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,591
That thing looks so heavy.

720
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:16,723
- I didn't do it by myself.

721
00:35:16,766 --> 00:35:19,247
I had friends to help.

722
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,161
You can't do that.

723
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:21,554
That's cheating.

724
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:26,820
I wanna look away but I can't.

725
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:32,086
Hey, hey, I think it's, ah,
I think it's broken, man.

726
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,348
It's not doing anything.

727
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:35,872
- That device will rip him
limb from limb,

728
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:40,268
separate his sternum, and
rip his ribcage apart.

729
00:35:40,312 --> 00:35:44,054
It will expose his whole
insides for the world to see.

730
00:35:44,098 --> 00:35:45,186
That's
not even scary,

731
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,753
that's just gross.

732
00:35:46,796 --> 00:35:48,668
- He was given an option.

733
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:51,497
He can either accept his
fate or he can choose.

734
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,109
He may dip his hands
in acid exposing a key.

735
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:59,200
Both a literal key and a metaphorical key to his salvation.

736
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,420
It has been surgically
implanted into his hands

737
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:03,204
and in order to save his life,

738
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,901
he must sacrifice his hands

739
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:07,252
and that other digital
life that he leads.

740
00:36:07,295 --> 00:36:09,602
Okay,
how long does he have?

741
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:10,994
- Seven and a half hours.

742
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:13,388
Seven and
a half hours?

743
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:16,913
We've gotta sit her and
wait seven and a half hours

744
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:18,654
before he actually croaks?

745
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:20,178
- But should he escape
with his life,

746
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,440
he will no longer
take for granted

747
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:23,529
that gift that he
has been given.

748
00:36:23,572 --> 00:36:26,053
He will be reborn a more
noble individual.

749
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:29,056
No, he will
be reborn as a cripple,

750
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,363
and that pretty much means
he can't be an asshole

751
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:34,453
because you can't call
a cripple an asshole.

752
00:36:34,496 --> 00:36:36,106
I'm gonna have to go get
him out of there

753
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,499
or we're gonna get fired.

754
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:38,631
Or something.

755
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:15,494
Man, that could have been bad,
alright?

756
00:37:15,537 --> 00:37:17,583
I just saved both of our asses.

757
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,541
- You have cheated him
out of his lesson.

758
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:20,542
And you
almost cheated me

759
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:21,717
out of a paycheck, man.

760
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:22,588
Come on.

761
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:29,508
Although, it would be pretty
fun to just up and kill him.

762
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:32,598
- Maybe it was not he
who was shackled.

763
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,992
I know they're
looking to fire me.

764
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:38,081
I think they're just
building up a case.

765
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,735
Gathering information.

766
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:42,477
That's why I got
this little gem.

767
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:43,957
With this, I'm gonna record

768
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,005
all of the horrible workplace
regulations, violations,

769
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:53,009
and make it impossible for
me to do an effective job.

770
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:55,447
Or at the very least, I,
you know,

771
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:59,494
get a lot of Youtube hits
from recording Plague.

772
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:28,523
Oh, stupid.

773
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,309
Stupid.

774
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:41,101
God.

775
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:44,060
Hackley, you idiot.

776
00:38:44,104 --> 00:38:44,931
Goddamn

777
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,257
You wave.

778
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:10,522
So, you
waved at her?

779
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:11,914
It wasn't
my best moment.

780
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:15,831
It looks
like there's a few things

781
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,398
that you and I need to discuss.

782
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:18,791
I still
think that we need

783
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:20,836
to have a conversation
about those rules.

784
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,230
I really think we need to
scale 'em back,

785
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:26,320
so that we can do our
jobs and just let loose.

786
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,235
I may have
just the thing for ya.

787
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:30,846
Come by my office after this.

788
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,067
So, how is our hombre
Mitre-Saw doing?

789
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,810
Are you learning the ropes okay?

790
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:40,116
- The past three years,
I've begun the process

791
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,162
of unshackling those minds bound

792
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:45,295
by their own sins
and injustices.

793
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:46,427
It is useless to teach them

794
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:48,603
this lesson without
pain and time.

795
00:39:48,647 --> 00:39:50,779
I've begun work on a
man named Tobin.

796
00:39:50,823 --> 00:39:52,390
He has lived his life
as a recluse.

797
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:00,049
It was in Tobin's 14th year

798
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:02,312
that he first
disobeyed his father.

799
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:05,315
This falling out set the
tone of the relationship,

800
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,882
and a pattern of
disrespect was born.

801
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:14,847
Now he sits confined by
his own preconceptions.

802
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,065
If he can break

803
00:40:16,109 --> 00:40:18,459
those ties in the next 14 hours,

804
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:21,331
he will live and be
better for it.

805
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:24,073
Okay, okay,

806
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:25,510
Ah, is that all?

807
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:33,561
So, everyone ready to get
out there and get to work?

808
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:35,128
Woo-hoo.

809
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:35,998
Thank you.

810
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:47,445
Ah, have I
ever been in love?

811
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:48,707
Yeah, of course.

812
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,186
I'm a guy.

813
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,100
I like girls.

814
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:55,496
You know, I don't have
the greatest dating life,

815
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:56,715
but I do go out.

816
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:01,763
I even tried the whole
online dating thing.

817
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:05,332
I don't know, no matter how
good things seemed to go,

818
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,639
work always seems to
get in the way.

819
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:10,859
It's hard to hold down
a relationship

820
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:12,600
when you're
contractually obligated

821
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:14,472
to kill all non-virgins.

822
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:23,045
Even if I find a girl
who can't die,

823
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:24,482
things still seem to go wrong.

824
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:36,581
I'm cursed.

825
00:41:52,901 --> 00:41:56,339
He left his
computer unlocked.

826
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,744
Watch this.

827
00:42:21,103 --> 00:42:23,541
Hey, Mom, what's up?

828
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:27,022
No, it's not true, slow down.

829
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:28,676
I haven't done that in years.

830
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,113
Would you just calm down.

831
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:32,506
Calm down, I'm gonna
call you back.

832
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,378
No, look, I'm gonna
call you back.

833
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,691
Okay, who the hell
wrote an email to my mom

834
00:42:43,735 --> 00:42:45,432
saying that I was coming
out of the closet?

835
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:51,743
Oh, oh, shit man,
hey, hey.

836
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:53,396
This is a five dollar
shirt, so just calm down.

837
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,702
This is a five dollar shirt!

838
00:42:56,486 --> 00:42:58,314
Hey, there,
Hackley,

839
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:00,490
how ya doing, big guy?
- Ah, shit.

840
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:01,622
Hey,
when you have a moment,

841
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,102
could you come up to my office.

842
00:43:03,145 --> 00:43:04,625
I've got some, ah,

843
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:05,800
some changes I'd like

844
00:43:05,844 --> 00:43:07,236
to discuss with you.

845
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,542
- Changes?
- Oh, yeah.

846
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,066
See ya in a moment?

847
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:12,328
Keep up the good work.

848
00:43:16,158 --> 00:43:17,159
Have a seat.

849
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:25,907
Um, what's
up with this chair, dude?

850
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:27,474
- I changed it.
- Right.

851
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:32,174
Anyway, hey boss, I'm actually
glad you called me in here.

852
00:43:32,218 --> 00:43:33,480
So, I got this bullet list

853
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:34,873
'cause I've been trying
to be more organized

854
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:36,004
like we talked about.

855
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,703
Hold on a second.

856
00:43:42,794 --> 00:43:44,665
- Right.
- Upper management

857
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:47,189
is very disappointed
with your recent snafus.

858
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:48,408
Those aren't
my fault, man.

859
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:49,583
We talked about that.
- I'm not, I'm not

860
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,716
here to point fingers,

861
00:43:51,759 --> 00:43:53,065
but they were your fault.

862
00:43:53,108 --> 00:43:54,980
So what, are you, ah,

863
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:56,329
are you handing me my pink slip?

864
00:43:56,372 --> 00:43:59,288
No, no, no, no,
no,

865
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:01,290
they're very aware
about how important

866
00:44:01,334 --> 00:44:03,118
Hackley is to this organization.

867
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:04,424
That's right.

868
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:06,513
15 company records,
don't forget that part.

869
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:07,949
Even though I don't
have all those trophies.

870
00:44:07,993 --> 00:44:09,516
- Sure, sure.
- So, if, if, if,

871
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:12,171
if you're not firing me,

872
00:44:12,214 --> 00:44:13,215
what am I doing here?

873
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:15,043
I put
in a request

874
00:44:15,087 --> 00:44:16,654
and it's been improved,

875
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:19,613
to bring in a consultant.
- A what?

876
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,570
A consultant.

877
00:44:20,614 --> 00:44:22,964
Let me introduce you.
- Great.

878
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:26,968
Adrian,
send him in.

879
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:31,843
Hackley, this is Michael Harbor.

880
00:44:31,886 --> 00:44:33,235
A reboot consultant.

881
00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:35,107
Reboot?

882
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,370
Companies that
have a stale product line,

883
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:40,068
bring him in to update
their products.

884
00:44:40,112 --> 00:44:41,069
To reboot it.

885
00:44:41,113 --> 00:44:43,115
- Hey, great to be here.

886
00:44:43,158 --> 00:44:44,507
Big fan.

887
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:46,509
Listen, I know what you
guys are thinking,

888
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:47,946
people are always leery
when somebody

889
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:51,732
wants to come in and reboot
an established commodity,

890
00:44:51,776 --> 00:44:54,517
believe me, I understand
those concerns,

891
00:44:54,561 --> 00:44:57,477
but I wanna take those
concerns and blow them up.

892
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,087
Poof!

893
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:01,437
We did amazing things for that
retarded kid down in Texas.

894
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:03,178
Yeah, what
about Fred and Jason?

895
00:45:03,222 --> 00:45:05,050
From what I understand,
they basically lost

896
00:45:05,093 --> 00:45:06,616
all of their
merchandising rights

897
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,967
after you got done with 'em.

898
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:11,012
So how
do we do it?

899
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:12,361
Do we have to--

900
00:45:12,405 --> 00:45:14,450
- No, no, no, we don't
have to kill off Hackley.

901
00:45:14,494 --> 00:45:17,758
We totally wanna keep the
iconic parts about him

902
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:20,543
like the mask and ax and stuff.

903
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:21,980
The parts we can market.

904
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:24,330
We just need to change
everything else

905
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:26,593
and act like it's the
same Hackley.

906
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:28,377
So, how
do we do that?

907
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:29,988
- Come on in, big guy.

908
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:33,339
What the
hell is this?

909
00:45:33,382 --> 00:45:34,557
- Meet LeMarc.

910
00:45:35,471 --> 00:45:36,472
Hackley 2.0.

911
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,215
Same iconic mask and ax.

912
00:45:40,259 --> 00:45:41,608
And then we change it up.

913
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:42,914
Take away the apron.

914
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:45,264
Cut the shirt in half,
show off the abs.

915
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,832
Hackley was always a
bit squishy.

916
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:49,094
No offense.

917
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:50,573
We tighten that up.

918
00:45:50,617 --> 00:45:54,490
Show off the guns while the
kids will be intimidated.

919
00:45:54,534 --> 00:45:57,015
And then we take his backstory.

920
00:45:57,058 --> 00:45:58,103
Whatever that was, I mean,

921
00:45:58,146 --> 00:46:00,192
nobody really cared
about it anyway.

922
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:01,889
We blow it up, poof!

923
00:46:03,456 --> 00:46:04,544
Make it today.

924
00:46:04,587 --> 00:46:07,068
LeMarc was a model gone crazy.

925
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:11,464
He started killing kids
who dressed poorly.

926
00:46:11,507 --> 00:46:12,508
It all ties together.

927
00:46:12,552 --> 00:46:14,554
Clever.

928
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:15,903
- Now that LeMarc's a model,

929
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:17,949
you don't need to hide his face.

930
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:18,819
Show 'em.

931
00:46:21,213 --> 00:46:25,739
Scary by day, by night, you
wanna go dancing with him.

932
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:29,961
Girls won't know whether
to pee their pants

933
00:46:30,004 --> 00:46:31,049
or take 'em off.

934
00:47:14,092 --> 00:47:15,354
Hey.

935
00:47:18,487 --> 00:47:20,925
Oh, that's hilarious.

936
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:22,622
You got turned into
a doll again.

937
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:25,843
Puppet, be
a a little PC

938
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:29,455
You know, even though
it kinda sucks.

939
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:30,630
My scrawny legs.

940
00:47:30,673 --> 00:47:32,893
Do you have any idea
how hard it is

941
00:47:32,937 --> 00:47:34,808
to get to work when
you're a puppet?

942
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:35,809
And I have to take the bus.

943
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:36,766
Everybody looks at me.

944
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:38,768
Kids, kids pet me.

945
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:40,422
But I do get the junior fares,

946
00:47:40,466 --> 00:47:42,511
so, I mean, that's okay to save
like a little bit of money.

947
00:47:42,555 --> 00:47:44,078
Still, not by this look.

948
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:48,735
What are you, what are you
working so hard on over there?

949
00:47:48,778 --> 00:47:51,651
Well, I'm,
ah, I'm trying to crack

950
00:47:51,694 --> 00:47:54,915
this chick that I've been
casing but she's clean.

951
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:58,919
I mean, I can't find a
damn thing on her.

952
00:48:26,425 --> 00:48:29,167
Somebody
needs a margarita break.

953
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,733
Nah, I can't, man.

954
00:48:30,777 --> 00:48:33,693
I gotta do my community
service at the high school.

955
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:35,913
Community outreach,
yeah.

956
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:38,959
They, they won't, they won't
let me do that anymore.

957
00:48:39,003 --> 00:48:40,134
Listen up.

958
00:48:40,178 --> 00:48:41,831
That attitude's gonna be
the end of you.

959
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:45,574
Goddammit.

960
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:49,970
Wrong kid.

961
00:48:50,014 --> 00:48:51,145
We're in here.

962
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:55,497
Are you aware
that your cheerleaders

963
00:48:55,541 --> 00:48:56,759
are dressed like sluts?

964
00:48:56,803 --> 00:48:58,413
- Not my problem.

965
00:48:58,457 --> 00:48:59,937
Hackley, this is AJ.

966
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,547
- Hackley?
- Hey, how ya doin'?

967
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,724
- Anyway, he's been having
some behavioral issues.

968
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,987
See if you can work some
of your magic there.

969
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:09,642
Yeah, I'll do that.

970
00:49:16,605 --> 00:49:18,607
Didn't I kill you already?

971
00:49:18,651 --> 00:49:20,261
- This like Scared Straight?

972
00:49:20,305 --> 00:49:22,350
Yeah,
something like that.

973
00:49:22,394 --> 00:49:24,352
They call me in and I
talk to good kids,

974
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:25,875
maybe made a couple mistakes,

975
00:49:25,919 --> 00:49:27,051
done a bad thing or two,

976
00:49:27,094 --> 00:49:28,617
and maybe I get to you before

977
00:49:28,661 --> 00:49:31,316
you get on my list of bad kids.

978
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,840
At which point I have
to cut your head off.

979
00:49:33,883 --> 00:49:35,450
But I'm sure that won't be you.

980
00:49:35,494 --> 00:49:37,626
Anyway, ah, what can
I do for you?

981
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,106
- I'm having trouble at school.

982
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,542
It's crazy and hectic.

983
00:49:40,586 --> 00:49:41,848
- Yeah.
- I just had

984
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:44,024
to blow off some steam.
- I heard you, man.

985
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:45,069
I can feel you on that one.

986
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:46,157
My life's hectic as hell.

987
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,071
Especially work.

988
00:49:47,114 --> 00:49:48,986
Man, I just feel so unfulfilled.

989
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:51,640
It's like I'm being
held down under the man.

990
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:53,947
Under this corporate
bureaucracy.

991
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,210
Do you know the freedom,
the beauty,

992
00:49:56,254 --> 00:50:00,040
when you pick up your ax and
you make that perfect swing

993
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:02,303
and, you know, it
connects just right,

994
00:50:02,347 --> 00:50:04,871
slices right through and
the head goes flying,

995
00:50:04,914 --> 00:50:08,266
making that sound?

996
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:11,051
Yeah, you, I, yeah,
probably not.

997
00:50:11,095 --> 00:50:13,662
Anyway, I had like four
of those at my last job,

998
00:50:13,706 --> 00:50:15,621
man, and I didn't even
feel a thing.

999
00:50:15,664 --> 00:50:18,232
And then there's this girl who,

1000
00:50:19,755 --> 00:50:21,148
I think maybe she
might be the one.

1001
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:24,760
Maybe she can help me fill
this void inside of me.

1002
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:27,763
- You can't base your
happiness off someone else.

1003
00:50:27,807 --> 00:50:31,637
They won't be here for
you when you need 'em.

1004
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,681
Yeah, and anyway,

1005
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:35,119
yeah, she's, ah,
she's really cool.

1006
00:50:35,162 --> 00:50:37,208
I might have to kill her,
but if I don't

1007
00:50:37,251 --> 00:50:40,733
then maybe she and I can get
together and I don't know,

1008
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:44,650
meet for sushi or coffee or,
I don't know.

1009
00:50:44,693 --> 00:50:46,478
Whatever you kids are
doing these days.

1010
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:48,958
But anyway, yeah, this
is not about me, AJ.

1011
00:50:49,002 --> 00:50:51,309
I'm sorry, this about you.

1012
00:50:51,352 --> 00:50:53,050
So help me help you.

1013
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,878
What's going on upstairs?

1014
00:50:55,922 --> 00:50:57,924
- I got detention for
having sex in school.

1015
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:01,232
Did you say sex?

1016
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:27,606
No.

1017
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:28,476
No.

1018
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:31,044
No.

1019
00:51:32,219 --> 00:51:33,090
No.

1020
00:51:36,397 --> 00:51:38,138
Like I was
telling you earlier,

1021
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:39,705
we got our rules.

1022
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:41,402
Company policies.

1023
00:51:41,446 --> 00:51:43,317
And they suck.

1024
00:51:43,361 --> 00:51:45,450
We spend a lot of time
putting people,

1025
00:51:45,493 --> 00:51:47,321
good guys and bad guys,

1026
00:51:48,366 --> 00:51:49,889
and we kill these
guys over here.

1027
00:51:49,932 --> 00:51:51,891
- Yes, an archaic
system built upon

1028
00:51:51,934 --> 00:51:53,371
a system of--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, look.

1029
00:51:53,414 --> 00:51:56,330
Nobody wants to hear you
drone on and on anymore, man,

1030
00:51:56,374 --> 00:51:57,853
but with that said, I do
like where you're going

1031
00:51:57,897 --> 00:51:59,377
with that 50 Shades
of Grey stuff.

1032
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,553
You know what I mean?
- No, that's not what I'm--

1033
00:52:01,596 --> 00:52:05,165
- That's 50 Shades of Grey,
the porn.

1034
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:06,949
You know what I mean.

1035
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:09,822
What are you writing?

1036
00:52:09,865 --> 00:52:11,824
- Your lesson shall be
about your hypocrisy

1037
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,521
about me droning on.

1038
00:52:15,044 --> 00:52:17,177
Anyway, look,
just once,

1039
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:20,659
I wanna be able to walk into
any one of these houses,

1040
00:52:20,702 --> 00:52:23,401
just lop off the first
chick's head that I see,

1041
00:52:23,444 --> 00:52:26,360
and not even think once
about whatever darkness

1042
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:28,057
lurks in her heart, all of that

1043
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:29,929
So I was thinking
maybe you and I

1044
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:31,974
can get together, make a
proof of concept

1045
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:33,889
about this all of this
gray area stuff.

1046
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:36,022
- You have to be reborn
with new eyes.

1047
00:52:36,065 --> 00:52:38,851
I have died
and been reborn

1048
00:52:38,894 --> 00:52:40,505
three times this week.

1049
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:41,462
- You need a lesson.

1050
00:52:41,506 --> 00:52:42,637
Find your own truth.

1051
00:52:42,681 --> 00:52:44,770
Re-emerge after sacrifice
with new vision.

1052
00:52:44,813 --> 00:52:45,988
Those are the rules.

1053
00:52:46,032 --> 00:52:47,729
Your rule
book is the worst.

1054
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:50,210
It's like a mix of
Alice in Wonderland

1055
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:53,561
and some kind of Taiwanese

longer than necessary, okay?

anymore of it.

concentrated stupidity.

Yeah.

1172
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:54,993

goes to Asparagus.

didn't believe.
- Okay, okay.

1179
00:58:19,844 --> 00:58:23,325

regurgitated one for you

1183
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,511
Oh, do something with that.

1184
00:58:37,035 --> 00:58:38,602
- Who wants to go to Bennigan's?

1185
00:58:43,128 --> 00:58:45,565
It's been a
good four months

1186
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:47,132
since I've come across a person

1187
00:58:47,175 --> 00:58:50,527
that has even a modicum
of common sense.

1188
00:58:52,659 --> 00:58:54,792
And maybe it's just me.

1189
00:58:54,835 --> 00:58:56,141
Maybe it's me.

1190
00:58:56,184 --> 00:58:58,143
Maybe everyone else is with it,

1191
00:58:58,186 --> 00:59:01,015
and I'm the one who's
cracking up.

1192
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,977
But it feels like
I've lost a grasp

1193
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,153
on anything and everything

1194
00:59:09,067 --> 00:59:11,373
that held any interest for me.

1195
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:12,984
Oh, shit, it's her.

1196
00:59:15,464 --> 00:59:16,378
Maybe she's it.

1197
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:20,992
I haven't been able to
get her out of my mind.

1198
00:59:21,035 --> 00:59:23,603
She's going to a
comic book store.

1199
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:25,474
I don't know how anyone
could ever think

1200
00:59:25,518 --> 00:59:27,389
a pretty, smart girl like that

1201
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:30,697
could ever be a potential
victim of ours.

1202
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:32,525
Maybe the feelings
I've had for her,

1203
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:35,267
the inability to get her
out of my mind

1204
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:38,052
is not a desire to
kill but love.

1205
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:44,537
What's she doing?

1206
00:59:46,234 --> 00:59:47,322
What is that?

1207
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:49,934
Ah, here she comes.

1208
00:59:52,806 --> 00:59:53,633

1211
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,558
She's a perv, I get to kill her.

1212
01:00:10,563 --> 01:00:12,043

The machine stole my soul!

1217
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:31,149
- I did it.
- Did what?

1218
01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:34,282
I figured her out,
man.

1219
01:00:34,326 --> 01:00:35,936
I figured out the girl.

1220
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:39,070
She's a perv and I'm
talking big perv.

1221

know what I'm saying?

1222
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:42,682
She's ripe for the kill.

1223
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,205
Well,
what'd she do?

1224
01:00:44,249 --> 01:00:49,167
Well,
have a look for yourself.

1225
01:00:52,257 --> 01:00:53,519

1226

01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,180
You know, for company,

1229
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:03,572
ah, company reference.
- Mm-hmm.

1230
01:01:03,616 --> 01:01:05,923
Yeah, company reference, right,
okay.

1231
01:01:05,966 --> 01:01:07,707
Oh, Hackley,
this is a landmark kill

1232
01:01:07,751 --> 01:01:08,839
for our company.

1233
01:01:08,882 --> 01:01:10,101
Ah, I'll write you the
press release.

1234
01:01:10,144 --> 01:01:11,450
I agree,
and that's why

1235
01:01:11,493 --> 01:01:14,888
I'm gonna do one of my
special, trademark kills.

1236
01:01:14,932 --> 01:01:17,325
Get this, I'm gonna wait until
she gets out of the shower,

1237
01:01:17,369 --> 01:01:19,371
right, and then--
- Whoa.

1238
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,901
You don't get to make the kill.

1239
01:01:27,945 --> 01:01:29,468
- Why not?
- This kill

1240
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:31,209
is very important to
our organization

1241
01:01:31,252 --> 01:01:32,863
and upper management
- Oh, come on.

1242
01:01:32,906 --> 01:01:35,692
is disappointed
with all your recent results.

1243
01:01:35,735 --> 01:01:38,259
Look, I've
done all of the leg work.

1244
01:01:38,303 --> 01:01:39,565
Why did you have me out there,

1245
01:01:39,608 --> 01:01:42,133
sitting outside, casing
the joint for hours?

1246
01:01:42,176 --> 01:01:43,525
I spent so much time on this.

1247
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:45,223
I put my heart and soul into it.

1248
01:01:45,266 --> 01:01:47,442
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, god.

1249
01:01:47,486 --> 01:01:50,271
So who, who are you gonna send?

1250
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:51,142
No, you.

1251
01:01:54,623 --> 01:01:55,842
You are a jerk.

1252
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,889
A rude, rude, jerk.

1253
01:01:58,932 --> 01:02:00,107
Not my fault
you ain't cutting it

1254
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:01,500
around here anymore.

1255
01:02:01,543 --> 01:02:04,285
Now what kind
of a sad, sorry, pathetic

1256
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:06,157
little man has to
run to his boss

1257
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,724
to lobby to take someone's kill?

1258
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:10,117
I just did that
to piss you off.

1259
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:11,553
- What?
- What?

1260
01:02:11,597 --> 01:02:13,904
I couldn't even care less.
- Hey,

1261
01:02:13,947 --> 01:02:16,297
leftovers in the break room.

1262
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,566
I'm just
telling you, man,

1263
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:27,178
you better watch your back

1264
01:02:27,221 --> 01:02:28,788
'cause you so much as slip,

1265
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:30,355
and I'll be there.

1266
01:02:30,398 --> 01:02:32,009
Not with this
company you won't.

1267
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:33,445
Now what's
that suppose to mean?

1268
01:02:33,488 --> 01:02:35,839
Man, you
are on program.

1269
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:37,797
You have not hit your quota.

1270
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:39,494
I heard El Canadian the
other day say

1271
01:02:39,538 --> 01:02:40,800
that if you don't hit
your quota this week,

1272
01:02:40,844 --> 01:02:42,976
you're outta here.

1273
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:44,761
That's exactly it, that's.

1274
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:46,501
Show me a little, a
little more sad though.

1275
01:02:46,545 --> 01:02:47,981
Like, like cry for the camera.

1276
01:02:48,025 --> 01:02:49,809
Like really, really--

1277
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:51,071
- Is that mine?
- And you know, so.

1278
01:02:51,115 --> 01:02:52,420
Yeah, this is totally yours,

1279
01:02:52,464 --> 01:02:53,726
I snagged it while you
were stuffing your face

1280
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,119
in the break room.
- Give me that.

1281
01:02:55,162 --> 01:02:56,598
No, man this is gold.

1282
01:02:56,642 --> 01:02:58,818
This is exactly what I was,
exactly.

1283
01:02:58,862 --> 01:02:59,906
No, hey.

1284
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:00,907
Hey, give me, no,
no.

1285
01:03:00,951 --> 01:03:02,343
Give me my blog.
- Grizzle, Grizzle.

1286
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:04,345
- Give me my blog.
- Back, right back.

1287
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:05,564
Right back.

1288
01:03:05,607 --> 01:03:07,784
Right back, over here.

1289
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:10,351
Come on, hey, what, what
are you doing?

1290
01:03:10,395 --> 01:03:13,572
Really?

1291
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:14,834
Goddamn horse.

1292
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,751
You know what?
I want you to have that.

1293
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,101
Think about it tomorrow
when I'm taking your girl.

1294
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:23,582
I'm done, I got stuff to do.

1295
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:27,368
Some of us around here
are closers, you know?

1296
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:44,037
- Rough day?
- Yeah, man.

1297
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:45,865
Rival, he's being a douche.

1298
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:47,127
Gah.

1299
01:03:47,998 --> 01:03:49,521
No, I'm sick of this.

1300
01:03:49,564 --> 01:03:50,870
- He hurt my feelings, man.
- No, this little pity party

1301
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:51,784
stuff, man?

1302
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,829
No, he, he, took,

1303
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:54,395
he says he's gonna
take Danielle.

1304
01:03:54,439 --> 01:03:55,875
The girl I worked so
hard to kill.

1305
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:57,921
She's mine.
- So, so he said he's going

1306
01:03:57,964 --> 01:04:01,359
to kill her tomorrow night,
right?

1307
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:02,795
- Yeah, I guess.
- And you need

1308
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,537
one more to kill to keep
your job, right?

1309
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:06,930
- Mm.
- Yeah, so you kill

1310
01:04:06,973 --> 01:04:07,974
her tonight.

1311
01:04:09,802 --> 01:04:11,195
- I can't man.
- Ah.

1312
01:04:11,238 --> 01:04:13,850
- Boss gave it to Rival.
- I thought

1313
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:15,895
that you was the
legendary Hackley,

1314
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:20,595
who holds the company record
of 174 kills since 1980?

1315
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:21,901
Well, it's a 196,

1316
01:04:21,945 --> 01:04:23,033
but some of 'em were Mom's.

1317
01:04:23,076 --> 01:04:24,643
- Okay, and, and, what happened

1318
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:26,079
when that, when that
telekinetic tried

1319
01:04:26,123 --> 01:04:27,254
to do battle with you, huh?

1320
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:28,299
I pulled
out her eye.

1321
01:04:28,342 --> 01:04:29,648
It turns out that
that's the source

1322
01:04:29,691 --> 01:04:31,650
of her telekinetic power.
- Mm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1323
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:34,696
And when, and when, and when
they shot you into orbit,

1324
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,090
what happens at the entire
fucking space station, huh, guy?

1325
01:04:37,134 --> 01:04:38,875
On that one,
I, I rerouted the power

1326
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:40,267
from life support

1327
01:04:40,311 --> 01:04:41,616
into the engine.
- Alright.

1328
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,140
Now that doesn't
sound like someone

1329
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:44,619
who would let some sorry
little suck ass

1330
01:04:44,663 --> 01:04:46,099
do his last kill, does it?

1331
01:04:46,143 --> 01:04:47,535
- I overloaded the
dilithium chamber,

1332
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:48,841
no, you're right.
- No!

1333
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:52,062
Now honestly, between
you and me, guy, let me,

1334
01:04:52,105 --> 01:04:53,715
you've been a real
fucking pussy, okay?

1335
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,065
- Hey.
- But you have.

1336
01:04:55,108 --> 01:04:56,457
And you know why?

1337
01:04:56,501 --> 01:04:58,068
Do you know why?

1338
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:02,028
Because you haven't had your
signature kill in a long time.

1339
01:05:02,072 --> 01:05:03,638
Now you get your ass out there.

1340
01:05:03,682 --> 01:05:05,902
And you show this whole
fucking company

1341
01:05:05,945 --> 01:05:07,642
what a real badass can do, huh?

1342
01:05:07,686 --> 01:05:08,774
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1343
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:09,862
- Yeah.
- That's right.

1344
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,081
Alright.
- Yeah, you're right.

1345
01:05:11,124 --> 01:05:12,517
I know, okay.

1346
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,475
- Hit me again.
- Yes.

1347
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:16,521
- Boom, yeah.
- Alright.

1348
01:05:16,564 --> 01:05:18,436
- Thanks man, I appreciate it.
- Okay.

1349
01:05:18,479 --> 01:05:20,394
- Exactly.
- That's right.

1350
01:05:20,438 --> 01:05:22,440
- Only, hmm, check this out.
- Okay.

1351
01:05:22,483 --> 01:05:23,484
- Yeah.
- Is this the video?

1352
01:05:23,528 --> 01:05:24,921
- That's the one.
- Is it cued up?

1353
01:05:24,964 --> 01:05:26,313
- Mm-hmm, it's good to go.
- Alright, man awesome.

1354
01:05:26,357 --> 01:05:27,706
Hey, yeah!
- Don't do anything

1355
01:05:27,749 --> 01:05:30,317
- Alright, now.
- I wouldn't do.

1356
01:07:08,894 --> 01:07:09,721
Hey?

1357
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:11,853
hey?

1358
01:07:40,621 --> 01:07:41,753
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

1359
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:42,580
You busy?
- No, no,

1360
01:07:42,623 --> 01:07:44,756
I, I can, I can talk.

1361
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:47,150
So, ah, so how did it
go with the,

1362
01:07:47,193 --> 01:07:48,412
the sheriff's daughter

1363
01:07:48,455 --> 01:07:50,327
- Not good.
- Oh, no.

1364
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,155
Don't, don't tell me
she had a gun.

1365
01:07:52,198 --> 01:07:53,547
You got shot again, didn't you?

1366
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:56,333
- No, she died.
- Ah, well that's,

1367
01:07:57,421 --> 01:07:58,465
that's kind of the point,

1368
01:07:58,509 --> 01:08:01,207
and breaking into a house and,
ah,

1369
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:02,991
and hitting her in the
head with an ax.

1370
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:04,384
Now isn't it?

1371
01:08:04,428 --> 01:08:06,647
I didn't even
do anything and she died.

1372
01:08:06,691 --> 01:08:09,476
- Come again?
- She got in the shower,

1373
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,523
I snuck in, caught a
little side boob action,

1374
01:08:12,566 --> 01:08:14,699
you know what I'm saying?
- Oh, nice.

1375
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:17,571
Anyway, I did my
thing, snuck up behind her,

1376
01:08:17,615 --> 01:08:19,921
I had the ax up and ready,

1377
01:08:19,965 --> 01:08:23,447
she screams and then she
just falls over.

1378
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:24,709
And she'd dead.

1379
01:08:24,752 --> 01:08:25,884
I literally scared

1380
01:08:25,927 --> 01:08:27,146
her to death.

1381
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:28,800
- Wow.
- I know.

1382
01:08:28,843 --> 01:08:32,064
So what, was it like
a heart attack or something?

1383
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:35,198
How exactly am
I supposed to diagnose that?

1384
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:37,939
I need some ideas on
how to fix this.

1385
01:08:39,202 --> 01:08:40,942
What are you doing?

1386
01:08:40,986 --> 01:08:42,857
Okay, so,

1387
01:08:42,901 --> 01:08:44,598
so I'm putting the
wife's head in the dryer

1388
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:46,165
so that the husband will
find it, right?

1389
01:08:46,209 --> 01:08:46,905
But it's not thumping.

1390
01:08:46,948 --> 01:08:47,775
It's too squishy.

1391
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:49,125
He's never going to hear it.

1392
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:50,430
You didn't
wash it first, did you?

1393
01:08:50,474 --> 01:08:51,779
It was too bloody.

1394
01:08:51,823 --> 01:08:53,955
There was no way he was
going to recognize it.

1395
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:56,001
What about one of these
dryer sheets?

1396
01:08:56,044 --> 01:08:57,481
Ah, no,
that won't help.

1397
01:08:57,524 --> 01:08:58,917
Well what
should I do?

1398
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,572
Can we concentrate
on my real problem?

1399
01:09:01,615 --> 01:09:03,487
I have no clue what to do.

1400
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:07,055
I have to get this kill
or it's my ass for sure.

1401
01:09:07,099 --> 01:09:08,535
Hey, well maybe,
you know it's,

1402
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:09,841
it's kind of cool.

1403
01:09:09,884 --> 01:09:13,366
It's like, you know you,
you scared her to death.

1404
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:14,976
Like that would look
really good on a resume.

1405
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,239
See, I
thought of that,

1406
01:09:16,282 --> 01:09:18,371
but how do I
substantiate anything?

1407
01:09:18,415 --> 01:09:20,373
I mean, I have to say that
I scared her to death,

1408
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:22,810
and then it would come out
she was like a diabetic

1409
01:09:22,854 --> 01:09:24,638
and didn't take her insulin.

1410
01:09:24,682 --> 01:09:26,597
And how would that look really?

1411
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,641
You can just
still hit her in the head

1412
01:09:27,685 --> 01:09:28,599
with the ax, you know?

1413
01:09:28,642 --> 01:09:29,382
Oh, come on,
you know

1414
01:09:29,426 --> 01:09:30,383
it doesn't work like that.

1415
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:31,819
Everybody would find out.

1416
01:09:31,863 --> 01:09:33,865
Can you imagine the
newspaper headline?

1417
01:09:33,908 --> 01:09:37,216
Hackley too scared to
kill living people.

1418
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,217
Pussy.

1419
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:39,653
Okay, how 'bout this?

1420
01:09:39,697 --> 01:09:41,612
Why don't you then, um,
I don't know,

1421
01:09:41,655 --> 01:09:43,483
let's like, let's prop
her against the wall

1422
01:09:43,527 --> 01:09:45,224
and then you take a swing,
you know?

1423
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:47,444
Yeah, okay, alright,
okay.

1424
01:09:47,487 --> 01:09:51,578
Good idea, hold on, I'm
gonna put the phone down.

1425
01:10:43,064 --> 01:10:44,283
I feel silly.

1426
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:45,893
Oh really,
well I'm the one

1427
01:10:45,937 --> 01:10:47,243
feeding a disembodied
head cookies

1428
01:10:47,286 --> 01:10:48,461
so that it'll thump better.

1429
01:10:48,505 --> 01:10:50,202
This just
pisses me off.

1430
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,422
One kill shy of quota.

1431
01:10:52,465 --> 01:10:56,077
I'm gonna lose my job
because of one stupid kill.

1432
01:10:56,121 --> 01:10:58,210
Someone as hot as her,
there's no way

1433
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,734
I would not get employee of
the month for a proper kill.

1434
01:11:00,778 --> 01:11:03,302
Really, that hot, huh?

1435
01:11:03,346 --> 01:11:04,129
You
remember that waitress

1436
01:11:04,172 --> 01:11:05,304
you did a few weeks ago?

1437
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:08,699
Oh, best tits ever.

1438
01:11:08,742 --> 01:11:11,919
Those were
some headlines.

1439
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:13,747
The things I did to her.

1440
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:17,098
Yeah, imagine
her but better.

1441
01:11:17,142 --> 01:11:18,535
Don't tease
me with her titties.

1442
01:11:18,578 --> 01:11:20,363
If you can come
help me figure this out,

1443
01:11:20,406 --> 01:11:22,669
you can see for yourself.

1444
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:25,759
Sure, I'll be
there in five.

1445
01:11:40,426 --> 01:11:41,297
Hackley?

1446
01:12:04,798 --> 01:12:06,800
Asshole.

1447
01:12:42,706 --> 01:12:45,099
Hey, boss.
- Hey, there, Hackley.

1448
01:12:57,242 --> 01:12:58,156
That's good.

1449
01:12:59,549 --> 01:13:03,117
Hackley, this is Black
Death from human resources.

1450
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:04,989
He's here to document everything

1451
01:13:05,032 --> 01:13:07,165
that I'm about to say to ya.

1452
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:11,691
I'm afraid that due to your
recent performance issues,

1453
01:13:13,998 --> 01:13:15,347
we're gonna have to let ya go.

1454
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:16,957
No, no.

1455
01:13:17,871 --> 01:13:20,047
No, look, I made quota,

1456
01:13:20,091 --> 01:13:22,833
and I killed Danielle, right?

1457
01:13:22,876 --> 01:13:26,445
And then Rancid and
that counts for double,

1458
01:13:26,489 --> 01:13:27,751
so that's three.

1459
01:13:27,794 --> 01:13:29,492
The Rancid
kill doesn't count.

1460
01:13:29,535 --> 01:13:30,406
What are you
talking about?

1461
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:31,842
It's, it's in the manual.

1462
01:13:31,885 --> 01:13:35,715
It clearly states if you
kill any other major killer,

1463
01:13:35,759 --> 01:13:37,064
it counts double.

1464
01:13:37,108 --> 01:13:39,806
Unless the
other killer is from RKS

1465
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:41,460
or any of the subsidiaries.

1466
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:44,115
It's a new change to the
Clash of the Titans rule.

1467
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:45,943
I told you there was some
important stuff in here

1468
01:13:45,986 --> 01:13:47,118
that I needed you to look at.

1469
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:48,380
And the Danielle kill?

1470
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,947
That doesn't count either.

1471
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:51,775
She doesn't have a
scratch on her.

1472
01:13:51,818 --> 01:13:53,211
The autopsy hasn't
come back yet,

1473
01:13:53,254 --> 01:13:55,953
but our company's not
getting credit for the kill.

1474
01:13:55,996 --> 01:13:57,607
It's a real shame, Hackley.

1475
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:59,739
A real shame?

1476
01:13:59,783 --> 01:14:00,871
A real shame?

1477
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:03,700
You're a real shame.

1478
01:14:03,743 --> 01:14:05,136
- What?
- I'm sick of you.

1479
01:14:05,179 --> 01:14:07,355
Why? What?
That's not very nice

1480
01:14:07,399 --> 01:14:08,574
of you to say.

1481
01:14:08,618 --> 01:14:10,707
Hey, Hackley, I need your
attention here.

1482
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:12,143
Hey, Hackley.

1483
01:14:12,186 --> 01:14:14,014
This needs to be done right.

1484
01:14:14,058 --> 01:14:15,625
The policy's very
strict about it.

1485
01:14:15,668 --> 01:14:17,278
I need to keep this legal.

1486
01:14:17,322 --> 01:14:18,236
Look at me.

1487
01:14:20,151 --> 01:14:21,631
Why don't
you make a policy

1488
01:14:21,674 --> 01:14:23,502
that lets me kill
this ass clown?

1489
01:14:23,546 --> 01:14:24,242
I called the media.

1490
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:25,461
They can't wait to see

1491
01:14:25,504 --> 01:14:28,028

1492
01:14:28,072 --> 01:14:28,507
Yeah, you know what?

Fuck you.

1494
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:31,728

this is very inappropriate.

It's played so heavily

I lost my resurrection

I'll tell

01:20:38,224 --> 01:20:39,747

01:20:47,233 --> 01:20:48,408

Hey, no, look, stop.

1558
01:22:49,312 --> 01:22:52,880
So, what can WD
Venture Capitalists do for you?

1559
01:22:52,924 --> 01:22:54,056
Well, I'm
actually looking

1560
01:22:54,099 --> 01:22:56,493
to get out of the serial
killing business.

1561
01:22:56,536 --> 01:22:58,016
- That's a shame.

1562
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,626
I've
actually got an idea

1563
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:04,327
that I think will create steady
revenue within six months.

1564
01:23:05,284 --> 01:23:08,070
I call it Other People's Pizza.

1565
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:10,724
Oh, Other People's Pizza.

1566
01:23:10,768 --> 01:23:13,118
Let's say that you're a
pepperoni person.

1567
01:23:13,162 --> 01:23:14,598
Your wife's a vegetarian.

1568
01:23:14,641 --> 01:23:16,034
You could like go halfsies,

1569
01:23:16,078 --> 01:23:17,949
but she might get some
pepperoni on her side,

1570
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,473
or even worse, you might get
some spinach on your side

1571
01:23:20,517 --> 01:23:23,650
Nobody, nobody but a
vegetarian would do that.

1572
01:23:23,694 --> 01:23:25,870

you out a box

with four mini pizzas.

1574
01:23:27,785 --> 01:23:30,353
One could be pepperoni,
one could be,

1575
01:23:30,396 --> 01:23:31,745
you know, the vegetarian,

1576
01:23:31,789 --> 01:23:33,965
one could be, ah,
barbecue chicken.

This is impressive.

1583
01:23:45,411 --> 01:23:48,632

missing something.

1584
01:23:48,675 --> 01:23:50,634
