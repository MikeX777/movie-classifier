12
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:58,949
Daddy's taking so long.
He must be having trouble.

13
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:03,694
Hey, Akiko. Maybe you should go
and help him out.

14
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,031
It'll be alright. These kind of things take time.

15
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:09,263
No matter how much you beg...
It doesn't matter.

16
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:10,663
Lfit's impossible...
then it's impossible.

17
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,064
I understand your situation...
but please...

18
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,731
As I already explained...
the entire place is closed up.

19
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:20,436
Mamiya Mansion is off-limits...
It's prohibited...

20
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:25,775
Whether you're from a TV station
or not... there's no exception.

21
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:31,156
Listen... In that mansion there
are drawings by Ichirou Mamiya

22
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,190
The last fresco by Ichirou
Mamiya is in that house.

23
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:40,397
It's the obligation of the media
to expose this legacy... -

24
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,593
You are too much! Why don't
you listen to me?

25
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,733
You think the word "TV"
impresses people like us?

26
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,468
What's going on here?

27
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:55,375
This guy wants to see
Mamiya Mansion.

28
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:58,583
The Mamiya Mansion?
Out of the question

29
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:00,953
That mansion has been closed for
30 years

30
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,982
What's their reason
for the visit?

31
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:10,389
They are a TV crew... he claims
there's a Mamiya fresco inside.

32
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:12,060
TV network?

33
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,126
Yes. He's doing research on
Ichirou Mamiya's life

34
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,399
It's part of a documentary
on the community.

35
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:25,700
- Are you from a TV network?
- Yes

36
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:30,510
And you're doing a program on
the area? A food and fauna show

37
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:33,646
A "taste of the community" kind of program?

38
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,985
- Yes, of course
- Excellent...

39
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:38,053
Instead of going to Mamiya...

40
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,449
Why don't you go to the
City Hall and see our huge tree

41
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:45,320
It's the biggest tree in Japan
...called 1000 Year Pine.

42
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:46,827
Well, maybe.

43
00:04:47,267 --> 00:04:51,829
Daddy needs to be more
forceful... he's no good at this

44
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:54,472
He always ends up
with people saying "no"

45
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:57,970
I wonder how he ever got to
be a producer.

46
00:04:58,078 --> 00:05:01,536
Don't talk about your father
like that.

47
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:03,547
But it's the truth

48
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:07,219
Since my mother died...
he's been getting worse

49
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:10,085
Sometimes I feel like a
babysitter.

50
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:13,319
That's good... I'd like
you to be my babysitter.

51
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:15,725
I won't be your babysitter,
Mr. Taguchi.

52
00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:19,262
That's no good.
She's so cold to me.

53
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:59,065
You understand... you must take
all the responsibilty for this.

54
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:00,965
What could happen?

55
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:04,842
You know... the stories about
Mamiya Mansion.

56
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:09,481
- The curse?
- Yes

57
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,277
If so... it's a good opportunity
to see ifit's true or not.

58
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:14,581
What do you mean?

59
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:24,629
If they come back safely...

60
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:27,831
We have a new venue for
tourism

61
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:33,070
If something bad happens to them
...by supernatural causes...

62
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:36,409
Think of the publicity
for our community.

63
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:40,510
Here is the key to
Mamiya's Mansion.

64
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:18,541
You're no good at this. We'll be here
til dusk. Let me try it.

65
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:19,882
Don't break anything.

66
00:07:51,284 --> 00:07:51,909
Watch out!

67
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,814
It's fine, fine!

68
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:50,272
Asuka... open it.

69
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,082
Go inside.

70
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,367
Won't it open?

71
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,071
Shall we go in through a window?

72
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:26,506
Won't it open up?

73
00:09:53,606 --> 00:09:56,439
- That's strange.
- Maybe it's the wrong key.

74
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,507
I don't think so.

75
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:01,339
Daddy... you have to push
harder.

76
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:03,543
My contact lens has shifted.

77
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:10,513
What?

78
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:50,191
I've just entered the
Mamiya Mansion

79
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:53,092
There's dust everywhere

80
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,824
I smell the mildew in the air

81
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:00,631
I'm worried about whether the
fresco has been preserved well...

82
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,964
That's a weird sound.

83
00:11:12,385 --> 00:11:16,981
Thirty years ago, the genius
artist, Ichirou Mamiya, died here

84
00:11:18,524 --> 00:11:21,755
Since then, the Mamiya family
had no one take over the house

85
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,425
For 30 years, no one has entered
this mansion...

86
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:28,923
What is that sound?

87
00:11:39,545 --> 00:11:40,534
That was close...

88
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:45,745
Everyone... This house is ready to
collapse. Be careful, ok

89
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:54,087
Daddy look you're covered
in dust.

90
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:56,923
- Oh? Still?
- I'll brush it off.

91
00:12:01,834 --> 00:12:03,267
There seems to be a room
over there.

92
00:12:45,912 --> 00:12:46,776
It's here... -

93
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:06,461
- The phones aren't working.
- Oh really.

94
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:15,164
My guess is... there's an
electric generator in the house.

95
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:20,176
An electric generator...

96
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:49,034
So now... we'll start operations

97
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:51,494
First, we're going to remove
all the dust

98
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:52,965
Then we'll see about the
condition of the fresco

99
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,165
Artistic renovation
is my specialty

100
00:14:56,409 --> 00:14:57,899
I'll do everything within
my power.

101
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:44,388
Emi... I made coffee.
Would you like some?

102
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:52,123
Father... Miss Akiko is working
very hard, take some to her.

103
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:54,163
That's right.

104
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:56,929
Why are you always like that?

105
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:59,938
If you hesitate she'll be taken by
someone else.

106
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:02,664
Lfit's her...
I wouldn't mind

107
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:05,234
It's time for you to
settle down

108
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:09,107
You're not going to be young
forever.

109
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:19,990
Why are you laughing?
I won't stay with you forever

110
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:22,686
You have to do something
with her during this trip

111
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:25,530
That's why I came along
with you.

112
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:28,523
What? You're so much like
your mom.

113
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:29,762
What did you say?

114
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:32,564
You sound so much like your mom.

115
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,736
Too bad... That's it! I'm going to
explore the house.

116
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:40,711
So you don't want coffee?

117
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:41,640
Not now.

118
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,844
Where's Emi?

119
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:02,383
She's around...
She'll be back soon

120
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,698
Since she was a little kid...
she likes to play by herself

121
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:11,029
She's always going to be a kid.

122
00:18:11,404 --> 00:18:15,033
You'd like for her to be
a kid forever.

123
00:18:15,474 --> 00:18:19,001
No... I hope she marries someday

124
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:22,846
So I can get back to living
a single life

125
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:25,348
There are so many things
I want to do.

126
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:27,912
See that... what a find
this is. Delicate and vivid.

127
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:39,020
Emi... where have you been?

128
00:19:39,658 --> 00:19:41,819
Don't you have some homework
to do?

129
00:19:42,428 --> 00:19:45,625
Nonsense... I'm on summer break

130
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:50,194
You were the one who convinced me to
come along..."A chance to see the world."

131
00:19:55,574 --> 00:20:00,034
Hey... Can you come down here?
There's something weird.

132
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:06,249
Here... another picture
has appeared

133
00:20:08,254 --> 00:20:09,084
And here too

134
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:11,353
Over there as well.

135
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:17,325
So this dining room is
surrounded with murals.

136
00:20:20,566 --> 00:20:22,431
What is this?

137
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:25,860
It seems to be a door
or something.

138
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:28,639
Here... this one seems to
be covered in flames.

139
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:31,602
Dark.

140
00:20:32,945 --> 00:20:33,877
Black.

141
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:36,442
Maybe trees.

142
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:39,941
That's human.
Look... that's hair.

143
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:44,285
If so... then where's the face?

144
00:20:44,557 --> 00:20:46,354
Maybe that's not a hole...
maybe it's an eye.

145
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:52,330
What? An eye?
It's spooky

146
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:55,624
Look at this!

147
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:57,601
It's a casket.

148
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,238
Too small to be a casket.

149
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:01,936
Maybe a casket for a baby.

150
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,308
What's wrong?

151
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:07,808
A baby! Baby!

152
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:10,677
The baby is burning.

153
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,088
What do you think about
this part?

154
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:31,733
These are the parts which
appeared later...

155
00:21:32,671 --> 00:21:36,266
They seem to be drawn without
an outline draft.

156
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:40,907
That's why they seem to be out
of proportion.

157
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,113
It's not logical... a fresco
artist wouldn't change concept

158
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:48,345
...in the middle of
a production.

159
00:21:50,823 --> 00:21:52,381
Yes... something seems to
be wrong

160
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:54,087
What happened to him?

161
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:57,020
Something must have happened
during the work...

162
00:21:57,463 --> 00:22:07,202
Some kind of traumatic shock...
it influenced his creativity.

163
00:22:12,711 --> 00:22:15,407
That is a believable story...
for someone like Ichirou Mamiya

164
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:19,446
But what could have happened?

165
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:27,251
Let's see if we can find some
evidence in the house.

166
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:28,291
Stop at once!

167
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:29,485
Why?

168
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:33,764
I am a reporter. And this
is my program

169
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,793
I am the one who does the
investigation...

170
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:38,492
You are here to shoot the footage.
This is my production.

171
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:46,067
Listen, Asuka... a documentary
is produced by everyone involved

172
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:51,242
This program belongs to all
of us: Taguchi shoots it...

173
00:22:52,117 --> 00:23:00,491
I co-ordinate the activity...
this isn't just your program.

174
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,060
Wait a minute.
Take it easy, Akiko.

175
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:04,686
Why should I wait?

176
00:23:05,297 --> 00:23:08,960
We need to make this clear
right now.

177
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:14,270
I'm sorry. I understand.
Go right ahead

178
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:18,007
I'm going to explore.

179
00:23:24,516 --> 00:23:29,476
What? What is this?
It's dangerous.

180
00:23:31,356 --> 00:23:34,917
I found this in the shed.
Isn't this amazing?

181
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:37,557
Why are you acting like this?

182
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:41,257
I told you not to mess around
with things before I checked.

183
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:45,568
Hey... Put that away.

184
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:53,071
Look out!

185
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:01,746
Taguchi... it's true.
Asuka is right

186
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:04,217
Don't mess things up in
the house.

187
00:24:29,114 --> 00:24:31,605
That's nice.
That colour looks good on you

188
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:33,683
Are you ready for bed?

189
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:35,953
Yes... It was my mother's

190
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:39,456
When I was a little kid...
she always wore this

191
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,756
So when you wear it...
you remember her?

192
00:24:45,564 --> 00:24:49,091
Not really. Her memory gets
dimmer and dimmer

193
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:54,262
When I try to remember her
I only see light...

194
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:56,500
It no longer forms her outline.

195
00:24:59,244 --> 00:25:01,303
What does your father say
about that?

196
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:05,777
He says that's the cruelty of
time in life and...

197
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:09,379
...tenderness of the same time.

198
00:25:10,055 --> 00:25:12,080
Those are smart words
from your father.

199
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:14,416
Akiko...

200
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,958
What?

201
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:19,522
Do you ever think about
marrying?

202
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:24,358
What?
Maybe some day I will.

203
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,035
Why don't you hurry up and
do it.

204
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,403
Emi... to get married... I'd need
to find someone to marry.

205
00:25:36,348 --> 00:25:42,309
Akiko... how about children?
Don't you want children?

206
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:51,763
Akiko...

207
00:25:53,365 --> 00:25:53,831
What?

208
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,870
Can I give this to you?
It would fit you.

209
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:03,840
You can't do that

210
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:09,470
It should be worn by Emi

211
00:26:12,818 --> 00:26:14,479
That's what your mom wants.

212
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:26,894
Hey... pick up your clothes.
You're making a mess.

213
00:26:27,065 --> 00:26:28,032
Okay

214
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:36,073
Akiko is tough... she won't
take care of you like I do

215
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:38,707
You must learn to be
independent

216
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,911
And look...
dirty socks. Take care of them.

217
00:26:45,717 --> 00:26:48,515
Alright. Alright.
You're such a bitchy woman

218
00:26:49,054 --> 00:26:52,046
I'd like to see the face of the
poor guy who will marry you.

219
00:26:55,093 --> 00:26:56,583
- I'm going to turn off the light.
- Just a minute

220
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,121
- Come on! Come on!
- Hold on

221
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:03,765
- I'm turning it off.
- Wait a minute!

222
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:06,727
Wait! Wait!

223
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:09,232
- Ready!
- Ok!

224
00:27:10,842 --> 00:27:13,140
- Good night
- Good night!

225
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:12,366
Asuka...

226
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,570
You are beautiful.

227
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:19,835
Give me back my baby.

228
00:28:25,117 --> 00:28:27,551
Give me back my baby.

229
00:28:39,197 --> 00:28:41,392
Give me back my baby.

230
00:28:46,671 --> 00:28:50,300
Calm down ok.
Baby?

231
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:55,641
I haven't done anything to you.

232
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,258
Daddy?

233
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:26,932
Daddy?

234
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:30,832
Did you hear... - ?

235
00:31:07,812 --> 00:31:08,779
Excuse me...

236
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:44,148
"Ken'ichi Yamamura"

237
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:08,995
What's wrong?

238
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:11,708
I can't breathe...
Help me

239
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:14,902
Pull the lever.

240
00:32:19,618 --> 00:32:22,587
No. The lever... up.

241
00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:02,851
What is that?

242
00:33:03,428 --> 00:33:05,396
It's just an amulet

243
00:33:05,697 --> 00:33:08,222
Not the kind you can buy
anywhere.

244
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,928
It's the real deal.

245
00:33:12,737 --> 00:33:13,931
I don't need it.

246
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,644
No Mr. Yamamura...
you can't do that.

247
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:24,504
You know my name?
That's an honour.

248
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,712
But I can't charge the person
who saved my life.

249
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,390
Thank you very much.

250
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:43,933
What are you doing with
so much gas?

251
00:33:44,202 --> 00:33:45,464
I'm using it for our
generator.

252
00:33:46,438 --> 00:33:48,338
We're shooting a TV program
at Mamiya Mansion.

253
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:51,870
Mamiya Mansion?
Wait. Hold on a minute.

254
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,658
Asuka... get ready.

255
00:34:16,534 --> 00:34:20,061
Taguchi... just follow her
with the camera.

256
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,467
Alright.

257
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,606
Wait. Wait. Let's use the
wheelchair for the camera.

258
00:34:27,011 --> 00:34:27,773
Alright.

259
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,947
- Emi
- Yes?

260
00:34:30,181 --> 00:34:31,944
Can you get the wheelchair
from outside?

261
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:32,906
Yes.

262
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:47,263
Eh... What's this thing?

263
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:56,100
What's wrong Emi?

264
00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:00,375
Let me do it.

265
00:35:12,957 --> 00:35:16,586
Don't touch it.
Don't!

266
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:28,998
How come she dug up
such a thing?

267
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:33,072
- Oh God... It certainly was a disgusting thing.
- I'm sorry.

268
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:39,250
I don't remember doing anything...
It's very odd

269
00:35:40,618 --> 00:35:46,284
I'm sorry I troubled you.
I truly am. I'm leaving now.

270
00:35:51,896 --> 00:35:53,090
Asuka!

271
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,459
Wait!

272
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:20,553
I'm going to take her to
the hospital.

273
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:22,754
Emi... please take care of things here.

274
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:25,494
Alright. But come back soon.

275
00:36:26,431 --> 00:36:29,264
Pack the luggage... we may
have to leave immediately.

276
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:30,458
Pack your daddy's too.

277
00:36:30,969 --> 00:36:31,958
Yes

278
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:34,335
How's that? Electric system failure

279
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,030
What?

280
00:36:36,307 --> 00:36:44,373
Big trouble. Enormous problems.
Maybe we've got another filter.

281
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,282
It just came off... -

282
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,681
It came offin my hand.
How's Asuka?

283
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,522
She's not injured seriously...

284
00:36:56,694 --> 00:36:59,561
But she hurt her head and we
should take some precautions.

285
00:36:59,931 --> 00:37:01,193
But the car is... -

286
00:37:01,332 --> 00:37:03,357
I'll go to the gas station and
make a phone call.

287
00:37:03,868 --> 00:37:05,199
It's about a 30 minute walk.

288
00:37:05,703 --> 00:37:07,637
Let me go for you

289
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:09,467
Not necessary...
You stay here

290
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:10,866
Just in case something
serious happens.

291
00:37:11,142 --> 00:37:13,702
What do you mean by serious?
What could happen?

292
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:21,313
Kazuo... don't you think
something weird is going on?

293
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:22,609
Like what?

294
00:37:23,688 --> 00:37:29,149
I can't explain it. But yet...
something odd is going on

295
00:37:30,562 --> 00:37:32,621
You know... like that baby
buried over there.

296
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:36,064
It's not strange to bury a body
near a country home.

297
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:38,635
Then what about Asuka going
crazy like she did?

298
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,395
Asuka?

299
00:37:41,706 --> 00:37:44,197
- She's basically a crazy woman.
- Listen...

300
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:46,400
I'm trying to be serious about this

301
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,812
You see...
I can feel something

302
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,449
There is something weird here

303
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:06,162
If we stay any longer...
something serious will happen.

304
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:12,469
What? Do you really believe
in things like the curse?

305
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:18,272
I'm just worried about the
way things are going for you.

306
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:22,034
Why are you laughing at that?

307
00:38:22,213 --> 00:38:25,546
Because it's funny.

308
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:26,911
It's not funny to care
about somebody.

309
00:38:28,553 --> 00:38:30,748
I never expected a woman like
you to believe in a silly curse

310
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:35,524
I wonder if you believe in astrology and the occult.
Nostradamus, witchcraft, spirits and the rest.

311
00:38:37,428 --> 00:38:39,055
It's actually a very charming
side of you.

312
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:44,425
None of this is funny

313
00:38:45,103 --> 00:38:50,405
When somebody talks to you
seriously, why don't you listen?

314
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:52,771
I'm saying
I admire you.

315
00:38:52,877 --> 00:38:56,335
Well it doesn't work... you
don't understand my feelings.

316
00:38:56,714 --> 00:39:00,081
- I understand everything... -
- You do NOT understand feelings

317
00:39:00,718 --> 00:39:05,246
Neither mine nor Emi's. You don't know
anything about our feelings.

318
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:07,690
Your feelings?

319
00:39:11,496 --> 00:39:12,827
Sorry...

320
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:17,567
I'm just a little upset.

321
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:14,419
Asuka?

322
00:40:24,001 --> 00:40:24,626
Asuka?

323
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:03,666
Daddy... I'm scared!

324
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:05,463
- The shadows!
- What happened?

325
00:42:06,437 --> 00:42:09,702
- What's wrong?
- The shadows are alive.

326
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:10,740
Emi!

327
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:54,716
Oh! You scared me!

328
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:03,617
What are you doing here?

329
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:09,962
Asuka...

330
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:14,169
Asuka

331
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,670
What's wrong?

332
00:43:19,644 --> 00:43:20,736
Don't you feel good?

333
00:43:23,147 --> 00:43:25,012
Pull yourself together.

334
00:43:27,585 --> 00:43:33,546
Hey Asuka... We'll fix the car
and go back to Tokyo.

335
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:42,259
Asuka...

336
00:43:46,637 --> 00:43:47,433
What is it?

337
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:51,274
- Everybody dies.
- Eh?

338
00:43:53,678 --> 00:43:54,508
Everybody dies!

339
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:15,283
Taguchi!

340
00:46:18,756 --> 00:46:20,656
Taguchi... where are you?

341
00:46:55,392 --> 00:46:56,586
Help me.

342
00:49:17,735 --> 00:49:20,203
It's taking too long...
what's he doing?

343
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:22,402
I'm going to check on him.

344
00:49:22,606 --> 00:49:25,040
Wait... don't leave us alone

345
00:49:26,076 --> 00:49:27,441
We're scared...
Don't leave us here.

346
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:32,245
Well... let's go together.

347
00:49:44,695 --> 00:49:45,354
What now?

348
00:49:53,203 --> 00:49:55,296
Who did such a thing?
Did you?

349
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,530
- Who are you?
- Come here

350
00:50:05,182 --> 00:50:07,309
Look... do you know what
this is?

351
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:09,074
It protects from the curse.

352
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:10,984
The curse?

353
00:50:11,755 --> 00:50:12,744
You destroyed it.

354
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:14,214
Not me...

355
00:50:14,825 --> 00:50:16,884
- I didn't touch it.
- Listen, Mr. Yamamura...

356
00:50:17,428 --> 00:50:19,055
We know nothing about that.

357
00:50:20,931 --> 00:50:22,091
Aki... do you know this man?

358
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:25,093
Yes, it's Mr Yamamura
from the gas station.

359
00:50:25,936 --> 00:50:28,996
- Are you her husband?
- No

360
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:31,333
Understand this...
you must leave.

361
00:50:32,776 --> 00:50:34,971
You have no right to treat me
like this.

362
00:50:35,145 --> 00:50:35,736
Hey

363
00:50:43,187 --> 00:50:44,711
What are you doing here?

364
00:50:45,022 --> 00:50:47,616
It's none of your business.
You must get out of here

365
00:50:48,158 --> 00:50:49,887
We want to go...
but we can't.

366
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:51,359
What do you mean?

367
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:53,956
There are two people still
in the house

368
00:50:54,665 --> 00:50:57,327
Lets go, Aki... we have to
find Taguchi and Asuka.

369
00:51:00,504 --> 00:51:04,167
Listen... you better not go
inside the house.

370
00:51:12,883 --> 00:51:15,647
- Hey Taguchi
- Taguchi

371
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:17,650
Asuka.

372
00:51:24,061 --> 00:51:24,755
Taguchi.

373
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:34,428
Kazuo... we better ask
Mr Yamamura to come with us.

374
00:51:35,172 --> 00:51:37,003
Forget about him...
he's a violent man.

375
00:51:37,674 --> 00:51:40,040
Daddy... I want to leave here.

376
00:51:40,544 --> 00:51:41,977
Stop... what are you guys
afraid of?

377
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:44,711
Taguchi?

378
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:48,445
Taguchi!

379
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:02,996
Taguchi?

380
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:08,963
Taguchi.

381
00:52:58,722 --> 00:52:59,654
Asuka?

382
00:53:52,175 --> 00:53:53,904
Are you alright?

383
00:54:25,442 --> 00:54:28,070
Mr Yamamura, what's going on?

384
00:54:28,545 --> 00:54:29,637
What's happening here?

385
00:54:30,647 --> 00:54:32,911
- Mr Yamamura
- Mr Yamamura!

386
00:55:01,345 --> 00:55:02,312
Mom?

387
00:55:07,417 --> 00:55:08,577
Is that you, mom?

388
00:55:18,695 --> 00:55:19,218
Emi

389
00:55:21,365 --> 00:55:22,024
Emi!

390
00:55:24,968 --> 00:55:25,764
Emi...

391
00:55:34,678 --> 00:55:36,475
- Emi
- Emi!

392
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:42,078
- Emi
- Emi!

393
00:55:43,687 --> 00:55:44,415
Emi

394
00:55:53,697 --> 00:55:56,359
Daddy...
come on.

395
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:05,333
Mom... he's coming

396
00:56:07,978 --> 00:56:09,912
Now we can live together again.

397
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:23,325
Daddy... what are you doing?
Come on in.

398
00:56:23,927 --> 00:56:24,621
Emi...

399
00:56:30,901 --> 00:56:32,129
Who are you?

400
00:56:39,409 --> 00:56:41,206
She isn't your daughter.

401
00:56:42,212 --> 00:56:43,338
What do you mean?

402
00:56:45,115 --> 00:56:45,604
Emi!

403
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:14,907
Mr Yamamura!

404
00:57:16,446 --> 00:57:17,174
Emi!

405
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:33,055
Idiot! Do you want to die?
Don't be such an idiot!

406
00:57:34,131 --> 00:57:34,859
Let go!

407
00:57:51,515 --> 00:57:52,539
Kazuo!..

408
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:56,148
Kazuo... pull yourself together!

409
00:58:11,635 --> 00:58:12,363
Kazuo...

410
00:58:16,006 --> 00:58:18,941
What happened?
What's going on?

411
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:24,807
30 years ago

412
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:29,442
The Mamiya family had a
long awaited baby

413
00:58:30,921 --> 00:58:32,718
Ichirou Mamiya
was overjoyed

414
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:37,017
He planned to draw his baby's
growth on these walls

415
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:42,654
However, his happiness didn't
last very long

416
00:58:44,501 --> 00:58:51,339
One day, Lady Mamiya went to the
cellar to turn on the furnace.

417
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:56,202
What's wrong with that?

418
00:58:59,316 --> 00:59:02,251
The baby... who just started
walking...

419
00:59:03,053 --> 00:59:05,647
...was playing inside the
furnace

420
00:59:08,892 --> 00:59:11,952
When she took her child out...
it was too late

421
00:59:12,696 --> 00:59:16,393
The mother also had terrible
burns... she lost an eye

422
00:59:18,535 --> 00:59:24,098
After this incident, surrounding
this mansion, babies disappeared

423
00:59:25,976 --> 00:59:28,240
Lady Mamiya was responsible...

424
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:34,814
She kidnapped babies and threw
them in the furnace.

425
00:59:35,485 --> 00:59:37,214
Why do such a terrible thing?

426
00:59:37,654 --> 00:59:39,645
She wanted to give playmates
to her dead baby

427
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:55,134
The villagers who discovered
the facts... invaded the mansion

428
00:59:57,774 --> 00:59:59,765
Lady Mamiya was cornered by the villagers...

429
01:00:00,477 --> 01:00:02,968
...and she threw herself
into the furnace.

430
01:00:06,616 --> 01:00:11,644
Lady Mamiya died and Ichirou died
a little while later

431
01:00:12,856 --> 01:00:16,087
But he kept drawing until
his death

432
01:00:18,595 --> 01:00:20,893
This is the story of the
Mamiya Mansion.

433
01:00:27,203 --> 01:00:29,603
We need to look for Emi.

434
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:32,235
Where is she?

435
01:00:33,009 --> 01:00:35,000
What's going on in this mansion
right now?

436
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:40,340
You woke Lady Mamiya whose soul
calmed the shadows

437
01:00:41,584 --> 01:00:43,245
Do you understand what you did?

438
01:00:44,955 --> 01:00:49,415
In this mansion... all the
shadows and darkness are alive.

439
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:53,324
Hurry, we must help Emi.

440
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:56,021
But... what can we do?

441
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:59,393
We must gather all the light...
including flashlights.

442
01:01:01,338 --> 01:01:04,501
Kazuo... We don't know anything
about this sort of problem

443
01:01:05,008 --> 01:01:07,101
Mr Yamamura... what should we do?

444
01:01:08,078 --> 01:01:11,673
Emi is captured by the shadows
...we must destroy them

445
01:01:12,015 --> 01:01:14,313
...with our lighting.
We'll find Emi.

446
01:01:14,451 --> 01:01:16,316
Everybody has tried that

447
01:01:18,188 --> 01:01:21,419
You don't understand... that
only aggravates them more.

448
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:25,616
You think so? Well, your
amulet didn't work either.

449
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:29,498
When you use light... then you
make new shadows, too

450
01:01:30,266 --> 01:01:33,724
You'll make shadows everywhere.
You have to think...

451
01:01:34,104 --> 01:01:36,732
Even inside your fist...
there is darkness.

452
01:01:38,508 --> 01:01:39,475
Kazuo.

453
01:01:42,846 --> 01:01:44,473
The necessary thing is
concentration

454
01:01:44,981 --> 01:01:46,141
The power of the mind

455
01:01:50,487 --> 01:01:53,422
It's troublesome to keep your
mind strong

456
01:01:55,525 --> 01:01:58,153
Even a big man with a weak brain
is useless.

457
01:02:06,569 --> 01:02:07,365
Want a drink?

458
01:02:09,606 --> 01:02:10,038
No.

459
01:02:17,213 --> 01:02:20,671
Akiko, do you have a child?

460
01:02:23,086 --> 01:02:23,916
No

461
01:02:24,788 --> 01:02:25,755
Not at all?

462
01:02:27,123 --> 01:02:27,817
Never

463
01:02:31,494 --> 01:02:33,394
You have no chance then.

464
01:02:34,431 --> 01:02:35,955
Why has she no chance?

465
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:40,762
It's not easy for a woman to
beat a mother.

466
01:02:41,071 --> 01:02:45,007
Especially the soul of a mother
who lost a child...

467
01:02:46,042 --> 01:02:49,273
And the soul of a child who lost a mother...
They attract each other.

468
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:53,380
It won't be easy to get Emi
back.

469
01:02:54,818 --> 01:02:56,718
You think her father can't do
anything?

470
01:02:59,222 --> 01:03:01,087
Try to squeeze this.

471
01:03:06,963 --> 01:03:08,590
There is no time for jokes

472
01:03:09,032 --> 01:03:12,490
- Emi might die any minute.
- I know where your daughter is

473
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:22,701
It's not a perfect method...
to enhance the concentration

474
01:03:25,815 --> 01:03:27,942
But it works... lfl can
squeeze this one... -

475
01:03:41,764 --> 01:03:44,028
Let's go, Aki... this is a
waste of time...

476
01:03:44,767 --> 01:03:46,200
I can't deal with this crap.

477
01:03:46,769 --> 01:03:47,633
Emi is in danger.

478
01:06:07,977 --> 01:06:08,841
Amazing!

479
01:06:30,466 --> 01:06:31,660
Let's go.

480
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:33,764
Can I take the light?

481
01:06:34,237 --> 01:06:35,727
If you'll feel better...
then do it.

482
01:06:57,427 --> 01:06:58,325
Here...

483
01:07:32,995 --> 01:07:34,587
Is Emi inside?

484
01:07:35,465 --> 01:07:39,834
Probably in the furnace...
she's trapped by Mamiya's soul

485
01:07:40,503 --> 01:07:43,802
Don't worry. I'm going to
help save her...

486
01:08:44,267 --> 01:08:45,131
- Mr Yamamura!
- Mr Yamamura!

487
01:08:45,368 --> 01:08:46,892
The furnace is at the end
of the hall.

488
01:08:47,003 --> 01:08:48,868
Aki! Get the light!
The light!

489
01:09:00,416 --> 01:09:02,782
- Try to keep the light on.
- I'm doing what I can

490
01:09:03,252 --> 01:09:04,844
But the wind is so strong...

491
01:09:16,065 --> 01:09:17,259
What are you crying about?

492
01:09:19,702 --> 01:09:21,761
You have a happy past...

493
01:09:24,173 --> 01:09:26,368
Memories of a happy life.

494
01:09:27,143 --> 01:09:32,137
Please... give me back my daughter.
Emi's just a child

495
01:09:32,915 --> 01:09:36,612
Emi still needs me.
You understand...

496
01:09:38,054 --> 01:09:42,184
Understand... you died a long
time ago... long ago.

497
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:50,191
Aki, Are you alright?
It's alright, it's alright

498
01:09:51,267 --> 01:09:53,667
Leave the girl and go back
to your own world.

499
01:10:02,945 --> 01:10:04,708
Hold on Emi... I'm coming for you.

500
01:10:08,885 --> 01:10:10,250
Mr Yamamura!

501
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:05,735
Emi!

502
01:11:15,384 --> 01:11:18,285
Run! The shadows
are coming

503
01:11:18,854 --> 01:11:20,082
But, Mr Yamamura...

504
01:11:21,557 --> 01:11:24,993
Don't worry about me.
Get out quickly.

505
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:30,324
Emi!

506
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:51,251
Mr Yamamura!

507
01:12:04,867 --> 01:12:05,993
Mr Yamamura!

508
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:24,978
Mr Yamamura!

509
01:12:58,587 --> 01:12:59,519
Let's go!

510
01:13:22,611 --> 01:13:25,512
- Emi, pull yourself together!
Emi!

511
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:31,950
We can get out.

512
01:13:33,255 --> 01:13:34,119
We're saved.

513
01:13:47,536 --> 01:13:48,434
It's no use!

514
01:14:05,287 --> 01:14:10,054
The shadow is coming...
stay in the light. Don't move.

515
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:36,045
It's no use. It's getting darker.

516
01:15:02,411 --> 01:15:03,810
Quick! Break it...

517
01:15:08,717 --> 01:15:09,581
Kazuo!

518
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:18,223
I did it!

519
01:15:25,668 --> 01:15:26,566
Aki...

520
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,172
Aki, are you alright?

521
01:15:40,783 --> 01:15:41,647
Damn it!

522
01:15:43,452 --> 01:15:46,080
Aki, I'm going back...

523
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:48,056
- But!
- It's ok

524
01:15:48,624 --> 01:15:52,116
lfEmi comes
out, please take her and run

525
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:56,127
Please... even ifl don't
come back.

526
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,029
I must go.
I have no choice.

527
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:19,385
I'll be back.

528
01:16:24,026 --> 01:16:25,015
Aki...

529
01:16:28,297 --> 01:16:30,197
I wish I had met you before.

530
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:48,674
Damn it!

531
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:53,544
Emi!

532
01:18:05,461 --> 01:18:06,359
Power of mind

533
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:13,865
Power of mind

534
01:18:25,547 --> 01:18:31,747
Please give me the power of mind

535
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:37,687
Power of mind.

536
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:27,651
Are you Lady Mamiya?

537
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,463
Your baby is right here

538
01:21:35,204 --> 01:21:39,470
Don't hide in the darkness...
show yourself.

539
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:56,717
Right, I'll come to see you then.

540
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:01,012
Not yet!

541
01:24:01,883 --> 01:24:03,441
I can't... I can't let you have
this yet...

542
01:24:05,187 --> 01:24:06,814
Give me back Emi first.

543
01:26:46,915 --> 01:26:47,813
Emi!

544
01:26:57,893 --> 01:26:59,190
Emi!

545
01:27:08,103 --> 01:27:13,006
This is an hallucination.
It must be

546
01:27:15,277 --> 01:27:18,144
That's it.
I'm being tested.

547
01:27:22,617 --> 01:27:23,982
The power of mind...

548
01:27:27,455 --> 01:27:34,793
Give the power of mind...
to me... Please.

549
01:27:58,119 --> 01:27:59,086
Emi!

550
01:28:01,056 --> 01:28:02,387
Give me Emi!

551
01:28:04,726 --> 01:28:06,353
You're a mother, right?

552
01:28:08,763 --> 01:28:11,960
Why don't you understand the
mind of a mother who lost a child?

553
01:28:15,337 --> 01:28:16,099
Emi!

554
01:28:53,975 --> 01:28:54,634
Emi!

555
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:56,406
Emi!

556
01:29:16,798 --> 01:29:19,392
Emi! Wake up!

557
01:29:19,734 --> 01:29:22,498
Emi!

558
01:30:24,766 --> 01:30:28,725
This isn't your child.
Why don't you understand?

559
01:31:01,536 --> 01:31:02,503
Emi

560
01:33:13,568 --> 01:33:16,366
Emi! Run!
Quickly!

561
01:33:45,533 --> 01:33:46,522
Akiko!

562
01:34:33,748 --> 01:34:34,715
Emi!

563
01:34:51,432 --> 01:34:52,091
Go back.

564
01:38:19,473 --> 01:38:20,701
Akiko...

565
01:38:24,478 --> 01:38:25,001
What?

566
01:38:26,514 --> 01:38:27,481
Where is daddy?

567
01:38:39,827 --> 01:38:41,158
I'll tell you later.
