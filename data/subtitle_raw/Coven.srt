1
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,083
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,041
Atrocious.

3
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:17,958
How many more deaths
would be necessary, Sir?

4
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,958
What can we do
if their determination is so strong?

5
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:30,625
Lucifer seals their lips so tightly

6
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,416
that we could pull them slowly to pieces

7
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,416
and still they wouldn't reveal
the secrets of the Sabbath to us.

8
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,083
What if the Sabbath doesn't exist?

9
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,666
What if it's just a dream?

10
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:48,416
If it's just a dream,

11
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:53,625
how is it that so many women
dream the same?

12
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,458
Counting the three from last night,

13
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:45,000
we've reached a total
of 77 executions, Sir.

14
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,041
We just need to deal
with the sailing towns now.

15
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:52,791
Sailors.

16
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,708
We haven't seen a man for miles,

17
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:58,875
just women.

18
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,583
Welcome, Your Honor.

19
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,458
I'm Father Cristóbal de Azpilikueta,
at your service.

20
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,375
The Lord of Urtubi entrusted me…

21
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,291
Your Honor, I'm Father Cristóbal
de Azpilikueta, at your--

22
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,208
Surgeon.

23
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,750
Excuse me.

24
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,833
Your Honor, I'm Father Cristóbal
de Azpilikueta, at your service.

25
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:15,083
The Lord of Urtubi entrusted me
to be at your service…

26
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,250
Father.

27
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,166
His Honor is tired.

28
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,333
I hope his chambers are ready.

29
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:25,208
Go.

30
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:32,250
- My Lord Judge…
- Where would I put so many people?

31
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,875
The soldiers can sleep in the stable.

32
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,333
But they also eat!

33
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,208
Who would pay for such expenses?

34
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,000
His Majesty.

35
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,125
<i>Seagulls are coming</i>

36
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,000
<i>Leaving for Newfoundland</i>

37
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:52,083
<i>Great dangers at sea</i>

38
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:55,208
<i>Greater dangers in the heart</i>

39
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,708
<i>Great dangers at sea await</i>

40
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,791
Take the one on the right now.

41
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,458
Has your father
taken you to Newfoundland?

42
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:13,416
He can't.

43
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,666
Isn't he in charge?

44
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,291
Don't you know women cannot sail?

45
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:20,958
Yes, they can!
You know nothing!

46
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,000
Have you ever sailed?

47
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,250
I haven't, but María has.

48
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:26,791
Have you sailed?

49
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,333
No, I haven't.

50
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,750
Not my sister. The other María.

51
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,708
María, the blond one?
She's a friend of mine. I'll ask her.

52
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,750
María "The Seagull."

53
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:41,041
She was called that because
she was always running along the shore.

54
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,875
She would run and shout.

55
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,291
How did she do it, Olaia?

56
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,958
I want to go to Newfoundland!

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,166
Ana, how can you tell
so many silly stories in one day?

58
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,541
-Give me the roll of hemp, please.
-He took her to the forest glade.

59
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,666
-Where we lit the fire?
-There!

60
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,541
Your father said,
"Climb the highest branch."

61
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,666
"Climb, little seagull, climb higher."

62
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,458
"Higher."

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,375
"Even higher."

64
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,458
Ana, María, go inside.

65
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:25,375
We're looking for Ana Ibarguren,

66
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,291
María Ibarguren,
Maider Aguirre and Olaia Isasi.

67
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:31,708
Why?

68
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,541
What's wrong, grandmother?

69
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,375
What's your name?

70
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:40,708
Don't move!

71
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,416
Go and get her!

72
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,958
Run!

73
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,625
Get them, soldiers! Catch them!

74
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:48,541
Don't move.

75
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,541
Come on, go after her!

76
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:54,125
They're running away! Over there!

77
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,250
Her eyes!

78
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,958
-We didn't do anything wrong.
-Lower your eyes!

79
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,375
Up against the wall!

80
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,333
Don't move.

81
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,666
I'll do it myself.

82
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:52,083
-That's it, look. That's it.
-Don't look at me.

83
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,375
It's all right. That's it.

84
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,666
Where's Katalin?

85
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:33,416
This is a mistake.
They have the wrong people.

86
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,250
No, they don't.
We're here because of you.

87
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:37,166
What?

88
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,416
You and your damn goat!

89
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,333
-Goat?
-Then why else?

90
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:42,708
It can't be because of the goat.

91
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,541
Then why else?

92
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:23,875
Up against the wall!

93
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:28,041
Lower your eyes!
All of you, against the wall!

94
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,750
Up against the wall!

95
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,916
Maider Aguirre.

96
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:34,916
She's this one.

97
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,666
Lower your eyes!

98
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:54,833
Katalin, where were you?

99
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,000
-I don't know.
-Why don't you know?

100
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:00,916
Tell me what they did to you.

101
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,583
Asked questions.

102
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,583
About what?

103
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,208
About you.

104
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,375
About Ana and me?

105
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:09,375
About all of you.

106
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:12,708
What did you say?

107
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,666
-The truth.
-What truth?

108
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,291
They want to know when
we went to the forest glade.

109
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,125
What we did there. Where we went.

110
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:24,500
What else?

111
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,208
They want to know how to get there.

112
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:30,541
I had to point out the way
to them many times.

113
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,416
and show them on a map.

114
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,833
Everybody in town
knows the way to the glade.

115
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,625
They don't need to lock us up for that.

116
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:41,083
Apparently, somebody saw us go there.

117
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:42,500
Who?

118
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:45,291
I don't know.

119
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,125
And what's their problem?

120
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,416
I don't know.

121
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,375
Katalin.

122
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,375
Then they asked me questions…

123
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,166
-Kind of…
-Kind of what?

124
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,250
I don't know.

125
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:03,666
Think.

126
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,583
They want to know how
we got home at night.

127
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:08,041
What else?

128
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,625
I don't know.

129
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,541
I don't know…
What the devil did they ask?

130
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,541
I told you.

131
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,166
When they realize
we haven't done anything wrong,

132
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,791
they'll let us go.

133
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,333
What have you done, Ana?

134
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,500
They'll let us go.

135
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:21,666
Why me?

136
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,875
Calm down. They'll let us go.

137
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,875
Katalin, who interrogated you?

138
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't know.

139
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,958
You keep on repeating "I don’t know"…

140
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,833
They were right there,
and you can't describe them?

141
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,833
No.

142
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,166
I couldn't see them.

143
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,666
Were they hiding?

144
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,083
No.

145
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,583
But if I looked at them,
they'd hit me here.

146
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,583
Up against wall! All of you!

147
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,625
Sir, you're mistaken.

148
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:57,625
I haven't done anything.

149
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,208
My name is Olaia Isasi. I'm a weaver.

150
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,958
Olaia Isasi.

151
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,666
No.

152
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,458
If this has to do with the goat,
we returned it.

153
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:06,708
-We just wanted milk.
-Wait.

154
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,125
We haven't done anything.

155
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,750
Stop it, Maider!

156
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,916
Calm down!

157
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,583
Calm down!

158
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,875
Calm down, Maider!

159
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,208
Maider!

160
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,333
Do you want me to calm down?

161
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,833
Do you want me to calm down?

162
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:31,000
-That bitch has informed on us!
-What do you mean?

163
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,666
Maider, please.

164
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,583
You heard.

165
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,250
So, what's she doing here?

166
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,083
She's confessed…

167
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:41,125
to a crime.

168
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,041
What crime?

169
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,041
They wouldn't say.

170
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,041
Did you believe them?

171
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,541
Have you thought
why, all of a sudden, this nice girl

172
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,250
wants to become friends
with a group of simple weavers?

173
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,291
What would she gain?
To be locked up with us?

174
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:03,125
Let's suppose that Katalin
has done something bad,

175
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:04,750
something terrible.

176
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,916
Before she gets caught,
she becomes friends with us.

177
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:12,083
And then she says that we did it
or that we forced her.

178
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,875
Why did you come back so soon?

179
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,250
What did you tell them?

180
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,000
Are you accusing me, Ana?

181
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,791
Since we were small.
How many times have I defended you?

182
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,625
She is not accusing you, Maider.

183
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,333
Look at this poor girl.

184
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,250
Do you think she's capable
of doing horrible things?

185
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,208
With that angel face.

186
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:45,041
Don't listen to Maider.
She's accused us all.

187
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,166
What?

188
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,375
Ana Ibarguren.

189
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,708
What did Maider say?

190
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:51,791
Olaia! What did Maider say?

191
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,416
That we are…

192
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,333
witches.

193
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:57,833
What?

194
00:14:58,541 --> 00:14:59,375
Witches!

195
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,208
Witches?

196
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,208
Father Cristóbal.

197
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:15,458
You've known us since we were children.
You know we aren't witches.

198
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,250
Talk to me in Christian.

199
00:16:18,916 --> 00:16:20,166
Father Cristóbal, please.

200
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,416
You know very well that we aren't witches.

201
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,208
-I'm not a witch.
-Lower your eyes!

202
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,375
I'm not a witch.

203
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,958
If you aren't one,
how did you know I'd ask that?

204
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,916
You asked the others.

205
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,375
What made you think that,
if they are, you are one, too?

206
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:15,208
I haven't said I am.

207
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,625
Why didn’t you say so?

208
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,458
Is it a secret?

209
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,916
Because I am not.

210
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:34,625
What is… a witch?

211
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,666
Don't you know?

212
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:42,500
I'm asking you.

213
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,833
How could you know you aren't one
if you don't know what one is?

214
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,000
A witch is a person
that hurts other people.

215
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,750
And haven't you ever hurt other people?

216
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,875
Not in that way.

217
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,083
In what way do you hurt other people?

218
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,083
I've never bewitched anyone.

219
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,625
I asked, in what way?

220
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,750
Why do you say I'm a witch?

221
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,791
Did I say you were?

222
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,583
Who said she was?

223
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:28,375
Did I?

224
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,750
No, Your Honor.

225
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:36,666
You said it yourself.

226
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,583
One of your friends,
Olaia Isasi, has already confessed.

227
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:46,750
Do you want to read it?

228
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:48,333
Second paragraph.

229
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,208
No? Well, I'll read it for you.

230
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,541
"Ana bewitched us.

231
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,291
She forced us to summon
Beelzebub, Satan, Astaroth,

232
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,958
Abaddon, Belial…"

233
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:06,791
Wicked grin.

234
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:08,458
Noted, Your Honor.

235
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,375
It's funny that you try
to make us all believe the same story.

236
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,250
Obscene position of the legs.

237
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,708
Noted, Your Honor.

238
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,500
It may just be the opposite.

239
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,583
You may be the victim
who was bewitched by them, right?

240
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,250
Nobody has bewitched anybody.

241
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,375
Never?

242
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,208
-No.
-What did you do then?

243
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,916
Nothing at all.

244
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,916
Do you spend day and night
doing nothing?

245
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:34,958
-I do other things.
-What kind of things?

246
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,583
-We enjoy walking.
-Do you?

247
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,083
-Like everybody else.
-What else?

248
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:42,875
We also enjoy the forest and the cliffs.

249
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,041
Sometimes, the night falls
and we walk back in the moonlight.

250
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,541
It's easy if you know the way.

251
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,625
Do you dance?

252
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,750
-Sometimes.
-With whom?

253
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,500
-Just by ourselves.
-Are there any men?

254
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:55,125
They're all out at sea.

255
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,083
Who do you dance for then?
For Him?

256
00:19:58,875 --> 00:19:59,708
For whom?

257
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,083
Very well.
Let's go back to the beginning.

258
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:16,666
You told me the facts,
but you didn't tell me the truth.

259
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,875
-I did.
-No.

260
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,500
I have inferred it from your silence.

261
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,166
What does "inferred" mean?

262
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:29,291
The Judge knows your thoughts
better than yourself.

263
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:34,083
Now you'll give me the details
of the Sabbath rite.

264
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,791
-I don't know what the Sabbath is.
-Of course you do.

265
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,708
You've just confessed it.

266
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,541
Do you mean the Jewish rite?

267
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,416
The Witches' Sabbath.

268
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,250
-Who do you summon?
-What?

269
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,750
Who do you summon?

270
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,833
Do you sing praises to God?

271
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,875
Yes.

272
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:59,250
Is it God you want to warm
with the fire of your kisses?

273
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,250
We don't want any other warmth
than the warmth of your kisses.

274
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,958
It's just an old song.

275
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,125
-What's wrong with it?
-Sing it.

276
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,166
Sing the summons.

277
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,958
-Do you want me to sing it here?
-Please.

278
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:40,125
<i>Listen to the echoes of seagulls</i>

279
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:43,583
-Excuse me.
-<i>When leaving for Newfoundland</i>

280
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,875
Can you explain to me
what exactly is the Witches' Sabbath?

281
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:48,666
No.

282
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,625
Because nobody has seen it.

283
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,458
Think you're clever, don't you?

284
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,708
Sing the summoning, the real one.

285
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,166
Did he ask you about the Sabbath, too?

286
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:13,375
No. When I spat at Father Cristóbal,
they brought me back here.

287
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,583
He yelled at me, "Sabbath, Sabbath!"

288
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,208
That's what he said.

289
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:19,125
What?

290
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:21,291
He asked me to remember the Sabbath.

291
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,458
How could you remember something
that you don't know?

292
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,750
The memory lies.

293
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,791
The mind lies.

294
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:36,833
He said one of you has bewitched my mind

295
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,583
so that I wouldn't remember
you took me to the Sabbath.

296
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:42,916
That you offered me to Lucifer.

297
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,750
Who is Lucifer?

298
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:46,750
The devil.

299
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:51,750
That you made me experience
wonderful things in the Sabbath.

300
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:53,916
Is that true?

301
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:25,250
Ana.

302
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:26,250
María.

303
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:28,208
Ana.

304
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:29,708
Ana.

305
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,666
Ana.

306
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,708
María.

307
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:33,666
Ana.

308
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,333
Ana.

309
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,250
Ana, listen to me. Come.

310
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:43,416
Ana, hurry up. Come.

311
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,791
Oneka, be quiet!

312
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:46,458
What are you doing?

313
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:47,916
You have to escape.

314
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,500
Go. They'll hear you.

315
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,250
-You must escape now.
-We know, but how?

316
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:55,083
I don't know, but we must find a way.

317
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,166
You must leave.

318
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:57,958
Your grandmother…

319
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,583
What were you going to tell us?

320
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,250
Oneka.

321
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:43,625
Oneka.

322
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,291
Your grandmother hid me in her house.

323
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:57,708
She came to try and get you out
but she was beaten away

324
00:24:58,583 --> 00:24:59,416
Is she hurt?

325
00:25:00,208 --> 00:25:02,125
No, it isn't serious.

326
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,375
Is that all you wanted to say?

327
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:08,541
Your grandmother told me that…

328
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,750
a friend of hers, in the market, told her…

329
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:16,166
women are being arrested.

330
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:18,625
They take them to the top of a hill,

331
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:22,875
they tie them up to a stake

332
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,541
and they burn them…

333
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,125
alive.

334
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:09,916
Take care, my dear.

335
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:11,708
Be good.

336
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:44,166
We just need to wait
until the next full moon.

337
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:50,041
Always, since I can remember,

338
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,458
sailors come back
soon after the full moon.

339
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,541
The tide is perfect. They never miss it.

340
00:26:57,541 --> 00:27:01,208
Last year, my father
came back two weeks later.

341
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:05,291
If María says so, then it must be true.

342
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,708
Katalin thinks more days went by

343
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,000
because she always misses her father.

344
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:14,458
What do you mean?

345
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,500
That my mind deceives me?

346
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:22,458
That's why I don't remember the Sabbath.

347
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:32,458
This food…

348
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,916
tastes like shit.

349
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:37,958
It's disgusting.

350
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:41,250
Lara is listening.

351
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,833
Good. That'll motivate her.

352
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:48,375
We've been like this for four months,

353
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:51,000
and it seems like years.

354
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:54,500
Will this come to an end some day?

355
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:57,083
You know what, Father?
We're sick and tired.

356
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:59,875
In some villages, we had to requisition

357
00:27:59,958 --> 00:28:03,750
barns and mills
because the prisons were too crowded.

358
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,708
Moral corruption is so widespread

359
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:11,208
that we even had to execute
three parish priests.

360
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,125
They celebrated the Christian Mass by day

361
00:28:16,208 --> 00:28:17,750
and the Black Mass by night.

362
00:28:19,583 --> 00:28:21,958
I cannot understand
why in the Basque Country

363
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:24,416
there's more sorcery
than any other part of the world.

364
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:26,916
People here are as fickle as the sea.

365
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:31,000
The sea, that road without roads
where men get lost.

366
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,875
My father used to be a sailor.

367
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:35,375
-Of…
-The sea took him.

368
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:37,791
That's why, at home,
we eat more meat than fish.

369
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:38,958
Of course.

370
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:40,875
But he used to beat me.

371
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:44,416
Punishment is good for curbing vices.

372
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,833
-The sea, that road without roads where…
-What vices?

373
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,625
Vices of the flesh.

374
00:28:50,583 --> 00:28:52,041
Yours, mine.

375
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:58,166
-Just a few… and out of necessity.
-Women spend half of the year alone.

376
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,875
They are vulnerable to any influence.

377
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:01,833
We're on the borders

378
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:04,208
of three kingdoms,
the mountains and the sea.

379
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:08,500
We were invaded by the Muslims,
by the Jews.

380
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,916
All those false religions

381
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,500
take advantage of poverty and ignorance

382
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,166
to corrupt the people.

383
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,916
And there's something even worse.

384
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,500
The pagan demons,

385
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:22,458
which have been expelled from the Indies
by the missionaries,

386
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:26,875
hide inside the whalers
in order to invade Christian lands,

387
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:28,000
they come through the port.

388
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,000
That's why I devote so much effort

389
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,291
to bless every ship that sails in or out.

390
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:33,791
Father.

391
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:34,708
Yes.

392
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,958
Ask them to bring bread
to see if this improves.

393
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,083
Some bread, please.

394
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,291
Give them bread.

395
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:47,416
How long do you need
to find material evidence?

396
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,750
About six or seven.

397
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,000
Days?

398
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,166
No, infidels.

399
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,625
And they are very hairy.

400
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:55,875
Give me two days.

401
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:56,958
Two days.

402
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,708
The sentence must be drafted.

403
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:02,125
As you say.

404
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:04,000
Two days to find evidence.

405
00:30:04,833 --> 00:30:08,291
The next day, I’ll pronounce the verdict.
The day after, the execution.

406
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,375
Make sure the carriage
is ready that afternoon.

407
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:15,375
Basque flies.

408
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:22,750
I do not want
to question your methods, Your Honor,

409
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:25,583
but you haven't even asked them
about their curses.

410
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:28,375
I didn't see them with my own eyes,

411
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:30,833
but the poor people from the village
have reported them.

412
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,041
Sheep suddenly stop producing milk,

413
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,500
Lord of Urtubi's bad harvest,

414
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,208
abortions.

415
00:30:39,291 --> 00:30:45,791
His Majesty has not sent us here
to resolve neighborhood problems, Father.

416
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:48,875
We're fighting against a Satanic sect.

417
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:53,708
Do you know the story of Frau Troffea?

418
00:30:56,166 --> 00:31:00,875
In the year of our Lord 1518,
in the city of Strasbourg,

419
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,125
Frau Troffea began to dance.

420
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,208
God cursed that city

421
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:12,458
as it gave in to the heresy of Luther.

422
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:18,458
People barely survived
overwhelmed by poverty.

423
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:27,083
On that morning, Frau Troffea
went to the riverbank with her son

424
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:29,250
and drowned him with her own hands

425
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:31,500
to prevent him from dying slowly,

426
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,916
malnourished, suffering from gangrene.

427
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:40,125
In the afternoon, she started dancing.
She danced and danced.

428
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,916
Day and night…

429
00:31:46,083 --> 00:31:46,916
until she was dead.

430
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:53,083
People,
eager for horrifying entertainment,

431
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,625
gathered around her.

432
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,041
But the people didn't know

433
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,875
that, sometimes,
the spectators become the players,

434
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:02,375
protagonists of horror.

435
00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:09,166
Soon, 153 persons were dancing
day and night in that square.

436
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,500
The soldiers could not stop them

437
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,458
because they were dancing too.

438
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:14,416
The town authorities
could not issue decrees

439
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,041
because they were dancing too.

440
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:20,166
Exorcists could not celebrate their rites

441
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:23,333
because they were dancing like whores.

442
00:32:27,041 --> 00:32:31,875
And that dancing epidemic
in Strasbourg caused 359 deaths.

443
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:38,250
There's nothing more dangerous
than a woman dancing.

444
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,416
But the most macabre dances,
the obscenest of them,

445
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,625
are those that take place in the forests

446
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,041
because they're secret,

447
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,500
because only Lucifer
and His servants know them,

448
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:53,041
because only they
have celebrated the Sabbath rites.

449
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,791
If we don't stop them soon,

450
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,916
those wicked witches
will reverse the order of the universe.

451
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:44,541
Higher.

452
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,541
Higher.

453
00:33:52,833 --> 00:33:54,375
Higher, higher.

454
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,333
Higher.

455
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:06,708
Father…

456
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,541
take care.

457
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,083
Be good.

458
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,458
Lower your eyes!

459
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:31,458
Lower your eyes!

460
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:35,708
Lower your eyes!

461
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:37,666
Lower your eyes!

462
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,125
Lower your eyes!

463
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:44,833
Witch!

464
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,375
Lower your eyes!

465
00:35:14,791 --> 00:35:16,916
Yes, the Sabbath!

466
00:35:24,083 --> 00:35:25,375
I'm a witch!

467
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:27,666
I'm a witch!

468
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,166
I'm a witch!

469
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:37,750
Olaia is right.

470
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,083
We must distract him.

471
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,333
Talk nonsense?

472
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:47,291
Make fun of him?

473
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,791
We must talk about the Sabbath.

474
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,250
Didn't you understand?

475
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,958
They'll burn us whether
we confess the Sabbath or not.

476
00:35:55,916 --> 00:35:57,625
He's convinced we've celebrated it.

477
00:35:57,708 --> 00:35:59,333
How can you be so sure?

478
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,958
Because he said so. And I had to sign it.

479
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:09,250
If they already think we're guilty,
why haven’t they killed us yet?

480
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,000
He wants to know more.
We must tell him what he wants.

481
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,333
It's the only way to buy some time.

482
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,291
What if we don't have time
to buy any?

483
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:21,166
-Yes, we do.
-There's one week left before a full moon.

484
00:36:22,208 --> 00:36:23,375
One week…

485
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:25,708
Distract him for one week just by talking?

486
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:26,708
It's impossible.

487
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:28,333
It isn't impossible. I assure you.

488
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,250
What do you know about the Sabbath?

489
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:34,583
We know there's dancing,
there's singing…

490
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:36,041
Children are sacrificed.

491
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,166
Did they tell you that?

492
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,166
The devil is invoked. Lucifer!

493
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:46,125
I know only one person in the world

494
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,125
who can talk constantly for days.

495
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:50,416
Really?

496
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,333
How many stories should we tell?

497
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,125
There are six of us.

498
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:58,791
If each of us can speak for one day,
we'll be safe.

499
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,708
I couldn't do it.
Not even for one hour.

500
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:02,041
We can do it!

501
00:37:02,125 --> 00:37:04,125
Let's make a story up
for each of us!

502
00:37:04,625 --> 00:37:07,250
For example,
you could have drowned

503
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:09,000
every sailor you didn't like.

504
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:13,083
Of course!
So I'm the only witch here then!

505
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:15,166
No. We will all do the same.

506
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,250
María will say
she has fireflies in her belly.

507
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:19,458
And she has fucked Lucifer!

508
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:24,625
Really?

509
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:27,875
Have you noticed how they look at us?

510
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,833
Ana.

511
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:38,083
I can’t remember anything.
What shall I say?

512
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,916
You'll tell the story
of María "The Seagull."

513
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:53,291
Every time she complained

514
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:56,666
because she couldn't follow
the sailors to Newfoundland,

515
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,250
your father would tell her,

516
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:05,666
"You're still too young
to grow wings,

517
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,833
but next year, they'll grow.
Now leave me alone."

518
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:15,875
She used to ask her friends
to look at her back

519
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,083
to find out
if wings were beginning to grow.

520
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:24,125
Until one day when I said

521
00:38:25,083 --> 00:38:26,083
"come here, little girl."

522
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,500
I took her to the forest glade.

523
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:31,291
But this is a secret.

524
00:38:32,375 --> 00:38:33,833
A secret between us.

525
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:38,708
I made her climb
the highest tree in the world.

526
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,750
To the highest branch.

527
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:42,875
I told her,

528
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:44,458
"let go of one hand."

529
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:46,875
And María let go of one hand.

530
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:51,083
Then I told her, "let go of one foot."

531
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:55,083
Then, "let go of the other hand."

532
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,625
And María

533
00:38:57,208 --> 00:38:58,500
let go of the other hand…

534
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:01,791
and…

535
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:02,875
Did she fall?

536
00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:05,166
-Did she die?
-No.

537
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:10,541
She flew away.

538
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:12,500
Did she go to the Sabbath?

539
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,875
Listen.

540
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:59,125
She'll drive him crazy.

541
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:25,125
Maider!

542
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:04,083
Is she breathing?

543
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,083
Olaia?

544
00:41:06,166 --> 00:41:07,791
Spider’s web! Hurry up!

545
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:09,458
Hurry up!

546
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:10,541
What did you say, Olaia?

547
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:11,791
Huh? What? 

548
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,125
What did they ask?

549
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:24,833
-Didn't they ask anything?
-Ana, please!

550
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:25,958
It's for our own good.

551
00:41:46,166 --> 00:41:47,166
Calm yourself.

552
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:28,041
María Ibarguren.

553
00:42:35,916 --> 00:42:36,875
I am the witch.

554
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:40,208
Me too.

555
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,083
Show me the mark of Lucifer.

556
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:08,541
Come on, girl.

557
00:43:10,625 --> 00:43:12,375
You can prevent unnecessary suffering.

558
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,208
He didn't mark me.

559
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:22,458
It's a painless mark.

560
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:26,041
If you scream when they prick you,
they'll continue until…

561
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,416
Why should I trust you?

562
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,916
-Do you have any choice?
-Father, if you use that devilish language

563
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,791
you'll pass to the side of the accused.

564
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,958
What a strange language.

565
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,833
They're rustic languages

566
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:40,916
used to talk with the beasts.

567
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,416
Dialects.

568
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,875
Dialects are languages to hide things.

569
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,833
I'll write it down, Your Honor.

570
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:49,666
Here.

571
00:43:51,166 --> 00:43:52,000
Where?

572
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:53,708
Here.

573
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:55,291
He marked me here.

574
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:08,250
False hope.

575
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:11,541
I'm sorry. I've made a mistake. I'm sorry.

576
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,416
It's always the same, Father.

577
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,583
The evil one likes to hide his mark.

578
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:18,708
If it's not under the hair,

579
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:21,250
he hides it in the shameful parts.

580
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:23,875
Even inside the nose or here,
for example.

581
00:44:33,083 --> 00:44:34,125
In the arm.

582
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,166
Where?

583
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,083
Here?

584
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:59,750
<i>Listen to the echo of the seagulls</i>

585
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:05,041
<i>When leaving for Newfoundland</i>

586
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,083
It isn't there. She's suffering.

587
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:12,375
She isn't suffering.

588
00:45:12,458 --> 00:45:13,625
She's twisting with pleasure.

589
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:17,250
<i>Great danger on the sea</i>

590
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:21,625
<i>Greater danger in our hearts</i>

591
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:27,208
<i>Just like the tree</i>
<i>The roots in the ground</i>

592
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,375
<i>And the branches towards the sea</i>

593
00:45:31,958 --> 00:45:35,291
<i>This is my spirit</i>

594
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:39,250
<i>If you leave me here</i>

595
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:43,750
<i>This is my spirit</i>

596
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:48,458
<i>If you leave me here</i>

597
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:53,375
<i>In the deep well of my soul</i>

598
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:57,500
<i>You sail, my love</i>

599
00:45:57,583 --> 00:46:00,083
<i>Visit me each night…</i>

600
00:46:00,166 --> 00:46:01,000
Listen.

601
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,458
She's summoning her master.

602
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:09,875
<i>Visit me every night</i>

603
00:46:09,958 --> 00:46:14,541
<i>I'll open the door for you</i>

604
00:46:15,625 --> 00:46:19,666
<i>From Newfoundland to this port</i>

605
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:23,541
<i>From the forest to the cliffs</i>

606
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,833
<i>We don't want any other warmth</i>

607
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:31,916
<i>Than the warmth of your kisses</i>

608
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,666
<i>We don't want any other warmth</i>

609
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:40,750
Stand up.

610
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,041
Swear to renounce your master.

611
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:52,416
Yes, sir.

612
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:56,041
From now on, you'll tell the truth.

613
00:46:56,583 --> 00:46:57,416
Sit down.

614
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:11,291
I'm the witch. I'm the only witch.

615
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:13,750
I bewitched them all by myself.

616
00:47:14,833 --> 00:47:16,750
They don't even know
what has happened to them.

617
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:18,125
How's that possible?

618
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:20,208
Don't you believe me?

619
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:22,958
To believe you,
I need to know what happened.

620
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,958
-With all the details.
-Lower your eyes!

621
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:28,291
Look at me.

622
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:39,875
<i>It was the darkest of nights.</i>

623
00:47:45,958 --> 00:47:48,083
<i>I was having a bath</i>
<i>in a copper bathtub.</i>

624
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:52,791
<i>A horrible old lady</i>
<i>emerged from the flames.</i>

625
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:55,041
I hadn't seen her before.

626
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,166
Did she apply an ointment?

627
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,083
Yes.

628
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:00,625
Then…

629
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,916
I felt something in my body.

630
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:08,833
A force.

631
00:48:13,166 --> 00:48:14,791
It was the call of the Sabbath.

632
00:48:18,833 --> 00:48:20,750
As my sister
didn't want to come with me,

633
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,250
I turned her into…

634
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,458
It's cold.

635
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:26,291
<i>a lamb.</i>

636
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:31,250
A devil's lamb?

637
00:48:34,041 --> 00:48:36,500
Your sister, a lamb. That's strange.

638
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:39,500
Certainly,
she wanted to satisfy the evil one

639
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:42,208
by incarnating
the very symbol of innocence.

640
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:43,791
Go on.

641
00:48:46,083 --> 00:48:48,333
<i>I turned Maider into a donkey.</i>

642
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:49,291
Katalin!

643
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:54,083
<i>Dressed in a priest’s cassock.</i>

644
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,583
-Blasphemy!
-Father.

645
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,916
<i>I had to turn Oneka into a goat</i>

646
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,666
<i>dressed as Lord of Urtubi.</i>

647
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,166
Girls, please.
I want to go to the feast, too!

648
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,291
And I turned Katalin into a pig.

649
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:14,833
Were you the only one in human form?

650
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,791
-Were you naked?
-No.

651
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,833
I was wearing a dress,
a beautiful yellow dress.

652
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:29,041
Because only I am
the chosen one of Lucifer.

653
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:30,500
And where is that dress?

654
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:36,458
After the Sabbath, I gave it to Izaro.

655
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:37,833
Bring it to me.

656
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:42,958
<i>None of them wanted to come.</i>

657
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:44,541
Olaia.

658
00:49:44,625 --> 00:49:45,916
Olaia.

659
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,375
-Hello.
-Hello.

660
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:51,166
<i>I went after them,</i>
<i>one by one, and bewitched them.</i>

661
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,500
What's up, Olaia?

662
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:54,333
<i>I bewitched them by playing a flute.</i>

663
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:57,041
Tell me to stop.

664
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,458
It's your turn.

665
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:04,666
<i>In the forest, near the cliff,</i>
<i>I made a great feast.</i>

666
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,666
I conjured up hams as big as tree trunks,

667
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:12,875
dozens of cheeses,

668
00:50:13,541 --> 00:50:15,083
jars and jars of cider,

669
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:19,250
and wine, lots of wine.

670
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:21,791
Do you want mushrooms?

671
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:23,250
-They're all for you.
-No.

672
00:50:23,708 --> 00:50:25,750
One, two and three!

673
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:28,416
Do you like it?

674
00:50:32,291 --> 00:50:34,458
And we swallowed up black hosts

675
00:50:34,541 --> 00:50:38,000
made with the blank mushroom
that grows under oaks.

676
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:41,416
Did you celebrate a Black Mass?

677
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,875
They didn't. I did it.

678
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:45,541
But you just told me
that they were there too.

679
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:50,083
Because I made them believe
that it was a real mass

680
00:50:50,791 --> 00:50:54,125
and that they received
real hosts from the priest,

681
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:56,208
but it was all just an illusion.

682
00:50:56,708 --> 00:50:59,125
How did you create that illusion?

683
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:02,541
<i>With smoke.</i>

684
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:06,000
<i>And in that smoke…</i>

685
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:09,958
demons came forth.

686
00:51:11,666 --> 00:51:14,166
I just need to close my eyes
to see my sweetheart.

687
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,625
I always look at him with my eyes closed

688
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:18,500
because he's very ugly.

689
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:21,166
But I don't mind his face

690
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:25,166
because he has a big…

691
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,750
What else? Green and with spines?

692
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:36,791
We swallowed them, spat them up
and swallowed them again.

693
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:39,250
Did you swallow the demons
through your mouths?

694
00:51:43,458 --> 00:51:44,875
Through our asses.

695
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:52,916
<i>I conjured up a drum,</i>
<i>a huge drum, a violin,</i>

696
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,833
<i>the skull of a male goat</i>
<i>and rattles for all of us.</i>

697
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:58,375
<i>From Newfoundland to this port</i>

698
00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:01,625
<i>From the forest to the cliffs</i>

699
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:05,125
<i>We don't want any</i> <i>other warmth</i>

700
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:08,541
<i>Than the warmth of your kisses</i>

701
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:12,083
<i>We don't want any other warmth</i>

702
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:16,083
<i>Than the warmth…</i>

703
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:23,875
Do you want me to sing the summons?

704
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:31,041
<i>We don't want any other warmth</i>

705
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:37,833
<i>We don't want any other warmth</i>

706
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,375
Write that melody down.

707
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:29,833
Your Honor.

708
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:31,833
What?

709
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:35,125
It's a chromatic scale.

710
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:37,958
Chromatic scale?

711
00:53:38,041 --> 00:53:40,000
It can go on endlessly.

712
00:53:42,416 --> 00:53:43,250
And Lucifer?

713
00:53:45,166 --> 00:53:47,000
Describe his physical appearance.

714
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:52,625
He dresses in black.

715
00:53:54,833 --> 00:53:57,458
Beard, light eyes.

716
00:53:59,291 --> 00:54:00,125
Beautiful.

717
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:04,458
Does he have a tail?

718
00:54:06,291 --> 00:54:07,166
Yes.

719
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:09,458
At the front or back?

720
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:11,458
At the front.

721
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,833
What was it like?

722
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:21,416
Describe it.

723
00:54:21,916 --> 00:54:23,583
Green and full of thorns.

724
00:54:23,666 --> 00:54:26,083
It gives pleasure from the front
and pain from behind.

725
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:31,875
Did he try to introduce it into you?

726
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:37,083
Lucifer pulled my girdle off and…

727
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:40,625
And?

728
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:42,500
And…

729
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:47,333
I cannot describe it.

730
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:52,875
Say it in your own language.
I mean it. I can't. It's…

731
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:56,208
It's too much. I can't.

732
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:04,833
I'm… I'm exhausted.
I can't think.

733
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:09,333
Can we continue tomorrow?

734
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:14,291
Do you know the Transverberation
and Ecstasy of Saint Teresa?

735
00:55:14,375 --> 00:55:16,083
Of course, Your Honor.

736
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:23,541
It's said that
she saw an angel in bodily form.

737
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,916
And it had a long spear of gold

738
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:30,916
and, at the point, a little fire.

739
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:35,541
"And it penetrated me through my heart
deep inside my body."

740
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:39,666
"And, when he took it out,
he took part of myself with him."

741
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:42,000
"It was so soft

742
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,500
that I felt scorched by the love of God,

743
00:55:49,166 --> 00:55:51,208
in a great love of God."

744
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:53,166
"And the pain was so extreme…

745
00:55:55,291 --> 00:56:00,333
it was such an extreme pain
that I moaned."

746
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,916
"It wasn't a physical pain."

747
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:10,250
"It was spiritual, although
the body also played a little."

748
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,166
-Of course.
-Yes.

749
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:18,208
Yes. It was just like that,
but it was… it was…

750
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:23,541
It was intense. It was much more intense.

751
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,916
It was like…

752
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:29,083
It was like this…

753
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:14,833
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry, Your Honor.

754
00:57:14,916 --> 00:57:18,041
This whore was trying to
bewitch you with her eyes.

755
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:19,541
Take that off. Go away!

756
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:27,958
Go on.

757
00:57:28,875 --> 00:57:29,708
And…

758
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,916
we flew.

759
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:40,083
We flew… like seagulls.

760
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:50,416
Are you all right, Your Honor?

761
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,333
Yes, of course.

762
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:58,125
Shall I make her sign her confession?

763
00:57:59,458 --> 00:58:01,041
The night has fallen.

764
00:58:17,875 --> 00:58:18,708
Proceed.

765
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:21,458
I haven't finished.

766
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:29,375
You must sign, girl.

767
00:58:30,666 --> 00:58:32,000
Sign it, Ana.

768
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:38,333
-Won't they release the others?
-You've done the right thing.

769
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:40,916
Now, sign it.

770
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:46,291
Is that it? Is it over?

771
00:58:49,708 --> 00:58:50,708
Are you going to kill me?

772
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:54,583
Sign it.

773
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:50,458
What happened, Ana?

774
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:51,416
Nothing.

775
00:59:54,708 --> 00:59:55,541
It's all right.

776
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:03,541
He believes anything I say.

777
01:00:18,958 --> 01:00:21,125
Do you think that witches always lie?

778
01:00:21,875 --> 01:00:24,250
They lie like they breathe.
Don't you know that?

779
01:00:25,125 --> 01:00:27,541
That young woman
has confessed to being a witch.

780
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:31,125
If, as you say, witches always lie,

781
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:33,458
then she isn't a witch.

782
01:00:34,125 --> 01:00:36,750
Salazar, don't you get tired
of inventing syllogisms?

783
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,333
What I mean…

784
01:00:45,458 --> 01:00:49,375
is that we have listened
to unique and wonderful confessions,

785
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:53,833
but they're just words, a witch's words.

786
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:58,708
If we don't witness
the Sabbath ourselves,

787
01:00:59,208 --> 01:01:02,833
we'll never know
if it's a reality or a dream.

788
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:16,291
Tell me what's going on.

789
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:17,958
Are they getting ready to burn me?

790
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,166
Nobody tells me anything.

791
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:26,125
What are they going to do?

792
01:01:28,666 --> 01:01:30,541
Nobody will hurt you.

793
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:31,583
How do you know?

794
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:34,166
Because you have power.

795
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:42,541
What does he want to draw?

796
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:47,000
What you have, but I have lost.

797
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:49,291
What have you lost?
Not even your virginity!

798
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,833
What have I lost?

799
01:01:56,041 --> 01:01:57,958
I used to be like you.

800
01:01:58,583 --> 01:01:59,458
Young,

801
01:01:59,708 --> 01:02:00,625
defiant,

802
01:02:02,083 --> 01:02:02,958
and wild.

803
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:06,125
But I paid a high price.

804
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:13,500
Then, I learned.

805
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:19,791
This cap covers our hair perfectly well

806
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:21,708
as they ordered.

807
01:02:22,291 --> 01:02:23,208
But…

808
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:26,875
they all know it looks like a big cock.

809
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:31,125
But nobody dares to say so.

810
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:33,583
Men are afraid

811
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,208
of fearless women.

812
01:02:36,291 --> 01:02:38,958
Why don't you help me
instead of telling me stories?

813
01:02:40,708 --> 01:02:42,833
That's what I'm doing, girl.

814
01:02:43,708 --> 01:02:48,666
But what's the use of talking
if you don't have ears.

815
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,916
Go back to your duties, mistress.

816
01:02:57,125 --> 01:03:00,916
Are you going to show
these drawings to His Majesty?

817
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:05,416
I'll have someone make an engraving
of the stages of the Sabbath.

818
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:07,833
People need to see to believe.

819
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,541
This first engraving represents

820
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:15,125
the witch applying the ointment
to the initiated young girl.

821
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:20,041
It perfectly shows Lucifer's main weapon.

822
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:21,375
What do you think that is?

823
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,541
-Lies.
-No.

824
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:33,875
Beauty.

825
01:03:36,208 --> 01:03:39,416
If the devil
wanted to sow evil ways in you,

826
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:40,500
how would he do so?

827
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:44,250
Would he ask this lady?

828
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:47,208
No.

829
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:51,833
Lucifer has other means.

830
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:56,458
Lucifer doesn't choose
his servants randomly.

831
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:00,500
He knows perfectly well
that only charming and delicate women

832
01:04:01,208 --> 01:04:03,000
who have just left childhood behind

833
01:04:03,541 --> 01:04:07,000
can enchant us
until we become voracious animals,

834
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:09,375
dogs devoted to pleasure.

835
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:10,333
Dress her.

836
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,833
I want to see when she bewitches.

837
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:15,708
I want to see
when you bewitch your friends.

838
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:20,583
Why celebrate a false Sabbath
if we can celebrate the real one?

839
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:23,125
Would you celebrate the Sabbath for us?

840
01:04:28,666 --> 01:04:32,083
Of course, My Lord.

841
01:04:33,208 --> 01:04:34,291
Your Honor…

842
01:04:42,166 --> 01:04:45,041
But I can only do it
when I feel Lucifer's call,

843
01:04:46,875 --> 01:04:48,541
on nights when the moon is full.

844
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:51,500
Your Honor…

845
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,333
Your Honor…

846
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:21,791
Magic!

847
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:50,166
Look what I've got.

848
01:05:53,041 --> 01:05:53,958
Listen carefully.

849
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:57,000
That fool wants to see how I bewitch you.

850
01:05:57,083 --> 01:06:00,375
He'll come on the night of the full moon,
and we'll drive him crazy.

851
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:02,458
What are we going to do?

852
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:04,500
Lucifer!

853
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:06,583
Lucifer!

854
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:09,166
Lucifer!

855
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:11,708
Lucifer!

856
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:15,750
Lucifer!

857
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:16,958
Lucifer!

858
01:08:45,791 --> 01:08:47,000
Lucifer!

859
01:09:14,916 --> 01:09:15,750
Very well.

860
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:18,708
Drum, violin, wine,

861
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:20,625
ham.

862
01:09:21,541 --> 01:09:22,833
-Have you told him?
-No.

863
01:09:24,916 --> 01:09:26,208
When are you going to?

864
01:09:26,291 --> 01:09:27,541
I can't tell him that.

865
01:09:28,250 --> 01:09:29,541
You cannot hide it.

866
01:09:31,666 --> 01:09:33,125
Is this skull okay?

867
01:09:33,208 --> 01:09:34,166
It's a cow's skill.

868
01:09:34,666 --> 01:09:36,250
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

869
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:39,750
We couldn't find
the skull of a male goat anywhere.

870
01:09:39,833 --> 01:09:41,166
Not good enough. Keep looking.

871
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:43,375
The donkey is outside.

872
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:45,500
We're looking for the cassock
to dress it.

873
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:47,541
Black mushrooms…

874
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:50,583
Your Honor,

875
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:54,625
two of the guards
have run away from the village.

876
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:57,583
Last night?

877
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:01,125
I saw them. Why did they run away?

878
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:03,875
The mothers and grandmothers
of the prisoners

879
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:06,500
have spread the rumor
of a forthcoming bloody revenge.

880
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:08,708
-Revenge by whom?
-The sailors.

881
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:13,208
Three years ago, in a less complicated
conflict than this one,

882
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:16,958
several of Lord of Urtubi's guards
were stabbed.

883
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:19,375
Are you saying they fear
some miserable fishermen?

884
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:21,916
It is my duty to warn you.

885
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:26,166
If you keep postponing the verdict,
you'll be exposed to real danger.

886
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:30,541
Sailors usually come back
soon after the next full moon.

887
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:31,916
The next full moon.

888
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,291
Yes, because of the tide.

889
01:10:38,958 --> 01:10:40,375
That witch is buying time.

890
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:46,916
Announce the execution.

891
01:10:47,958 --> 01:10:49,041
Yes, Your Honor.

892
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:57,666
On this glorious day,

893
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:01,833
Thursday 6th November,
in the Year of Grace 1609,

894
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,791
an exemplary trial is drawn to a close.

895
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:07,583
It will leave a mark
in the history of the Devil's works

896
01:11:08,083 --> 01:11:13,833
Thanks to the unprecedented testimonies
of Ana Ibarguren, repentant witch,

897
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:17,041
we were able to reconstruct
for the first time

898
01:11:17,125 --> 01:11:21,625
the complete and detailed chronology
of the most atrocious of crimes,

899
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:26,125
an offense of divine lese-majesty,
the Witches' Sabbath.

900
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:30,875
The execution ceremony
will take place tomorrow at dawn.

901
01:11:31,666 --> 01:11:35,125
The accused, Ana Ibarguren,
María Ibarguren,

902
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:40,125
Oneka Albisu, Olaia Isasi,
Maider Aguirre and Katalina de Ugalde,

903
01:11:40,833 --> 01:11:43,750
who were found guilty
of participating in the Sabbath,

904
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,458
shall be burnt at the stake.

905
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:47,916
Their ashes
shall be thrown to the wind,

906
01:11:48,041 --> 01:11:51,083
and their property
shall be confiscated by the Crown.

907
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,916
Ana, I saw him.

908
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:10,666
-Who?
-Lucifer.

909
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:13,083
-When?
-Last night.

910
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:15,500
-Where?
-Here.

911
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:18,583
He came to illuminate your dreams.

912
01:12:21,125 --> 01:12:23,166
He looked just like you described him.

913
01:12:29,041 --> 01:12:30,416
Beard and light eyes?

914
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,833
Yes.

915
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:36,875
I have him bewitched!

916
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:42,250
He won't let them kill us.

917
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:45,291
He'll wait until full moon.
He'll come for us.

918
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:47,041
I swear!

919
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:49,500
He's stronger than us.
He's made fun of you.

920
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:51,041
No. I'm serious.

921
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:53,666
He cannot live
without witnessing the Sabbath.

922
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,916
He needs to see me dancing for him.

923
01:12:56,541 --> 01:12:58,041
I've seen it in his eyes, María.

924
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:03,625
Ana is right.

925
01:13:04,208 --> 01:13:06,041
Lucifer will come for us.

926
01:13:23,958 --> 01:13:24,791
Up against the wall!

927
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:26,416
What are you doing?

928
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:27,875
Up against the wall!

929
01:13:28,666 --> 01:13:30,041
Call the Judge right now!

930
01:15:19,458 --> 01:15:20,916
They're like beasts.

931
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:21,875
Your Honor.

932
01:15:24,375 --> 01:15:27,291
Don't you think this is ridiculous?

933
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:30,500
Perhaps.

934
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:03,041
He wants us to show him the Sabbath.

935
01:17:42,916 --> 01:17:44,125
Lucifer!

936
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:28,916
Oh! I've been turned into a pig.

937
01:19:10,458 --> 01:19:12,291
And? What do you say now?

938
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:17,708
If the Sabbath is a dream.
Then we are all dreaming the same.

939
01:19:17,791 --> 01:19:19,708
<i>We don't want any other warmth</i>

940
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:23,666

Lucifer!

980
01:23:04,916 --> 01:23:06,041
Your Honor.

981
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:23,916
Take the prisoners away!

982
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,500
You have no authority to impose orders.

983
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:31,208
-In the name of God.
-In the name of Your Majesty.

984
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:33,500
I demand obedience.

985
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:00,166
Let go of me. Let go.

986
01:24:04,041 --> 01:24:05,625
Go away. What are you doing?

987
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,750
Let go of me.

988
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:07,458
Look at them in their eyes!

We'll fly. Right, Ana?

995
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:26,958
Yes.

996
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:33,583
They fly.
