Each night on the island called Manhattan,

16
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:16,875
many a lost soul decides to give
up the unequal struggle.

17
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:20,079
Is it one of these carefree dancers? No.

18
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:26,485
Is it this seductive hat check chick? No.

19
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:32,324
Then it must be, well,
naturally, it's this schmo.

20
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,626
Oh, good evening, Mr. Donovan.

21
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,327
You're entitled to your opinion.

22
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:37,296
How's Broadway's leading talent agent?

23
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:41,383
Great. Would you please give
Connie this suicide note?

24
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:42,734
With pleasure.

25
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:44,503
It's been nice knowing you, Chuck.

26
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:47,723
I bid goodbye to all this.

27
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:51,076
Here. Where I'm going I won't be needing it.

28
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:54,279
Frankly, I won't find
much use for it, either.

29
00:01:57,218 --> 00:02:00,319
The only agent who can get
you the Randolph girl,

30
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,554
is Charles Patrick Donovan.

31
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:04,189
Never heard of any of them.

32
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:05,508
Oh, that's not important.

33
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,193
Two years ago, no one ever heard of me.

34
00:02:08,262 --> 00:02:10,329
Today, I'm the vitamin king of America.

35
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,997
And who put you on the throne?

36
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:14,166
I did, because I handled your advertising.

37
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:17,268
But if you're going to deal with
some fly-by-night character...

38
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:20,539
Do you think that your friend
could get us the Randolph girl?

39
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,941
Charles Patrick can do anything.

40
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,776
Only nobody ever asks him to.

41
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,411
All right, my dear. Go ahead.

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen.

43
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,616
Well, thank you.

44
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,490
Have you seen Chuck?

45
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,359
I've seen him. He left you a note.

46
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:43,962
Oh, no. I'm afraid to open it. You read it.

47
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,966
Dear Connie, it's no use, I'm a failure.

48
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,236
By the time you read this, my
crushed body will be lying on

49
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:55,507
the subway tracks in time square station.
Farewell, Chuck.

50
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:57,743
Ps. On the downtown side.

51
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:01,346
Oh, Hazel, I've just got to
save him, I've just got to.

52
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,148
I hope I get there in time.

53
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:05,984
Try being late once and see what happens.

54
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:24,297
Are you getting on?

55
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,298
No, thanks. I'm not going anywhere.

56
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:51,724
Connie.

57
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,026
Chuck.

58
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:56,261
Oh, Chuck, you're all right.

59
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,531
For a minute I thought I'd never
see you again. Oh, Chuck...

60
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,799
You're not dead.

61
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,868
I'll say not.

62
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,103
I thought you were going to end it all.

63
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,639
I was waiting for an express. An express.

64
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,675
You didn't think I'd go under a local

65
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:11,610
and die a slow death.

66
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,045
Oh, Chuck.

67
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:20,252
Ok, ok. Break it up. What do you
want for a dime, Mildred Pierce?

68
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:22,521
Oh, Chuck, I've got the most wonderful news.

69
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,923
You never have to commit suicide again.
I don't?

70
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,059
You know how I keep my ears open...

71
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,528
Trying to drum up business for you.

72
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,239
So what?

73
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,508
The Randolph girl. I've seen her before.

74
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,511
That's how I learned about women.

75
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,681
Oh, Chucky, that girl is going
to help us get married.

76
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,750
What do you mean, help us?

77
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,269
You've heard of Evans
ever good, the vitamin king.

78
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,339
He wants Bob Randolph and his
model for a television show.

79
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,257
That's quite a package.

80
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:01,326
I can see you're working already.

81
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:04,096
If you sign him, you get 10% of 100 grand.

82
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:08,467
10 gs. You're the most
wonderful girl in the world.

83
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:32,257
3-2-8. 3-2-8, 13. That's my lucky number.

84
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:42,167
If it's about that television
show, the answer is no.

85
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,637
You were expecting me?

86
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:49,775
Not particularly. We've thrown
out 25 agents in the last week.

87
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:51,093
Better catch him at home.

88
00:06:51,094 --> 00:06:52,627
If you'll give his address...

89
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,113
Sure. 328 queens road.

90
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:58,250
328 queens road. Thank you very much.

91
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,832
Pardon me. This is 328 queens road.

92
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,134
That's right. He lives upstairs.

93
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,240
You must think I'm pretty dumb.

94
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,042
Yeah.

95
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,411
Give you one more chance.

96
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,548
If you can tell me where
I can find his model...

97
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,817
If you find out, let me know.

98
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:33,235
I'm sort of curious myself.

99
00:07:33,236 --> 00:07:34,486
You've never seen her?

100
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:35,420
Nobody is ever seen her.

101
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,856
He sneaks her in and out of the place

102
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:39,624
like it was a fraternity house.

103
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:40,693
Why all the mystery?

104
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,093
You'll have to ask my boss.

105
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,129
He's always kept her under wraps.

106
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:52,170
She could use them.

107
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,034
Well, I guess that's enough for today.

108
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,986
Bobby, are we having dinner tonight?

109
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,671
What did you say?

110
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,190
Are we having dinner tonight?

111
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:29,541
What day is this?

112
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,611
Don't you ever look at your own calendars?
It's Tuesday.

113
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,180
Tuesday. Ok, Penelope.

114
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,349
The name is Lorraine, remember?

115
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:45,190
You will let me know what time
you want lunch brought in.

116
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,092
Miss Brooks, do you have a match?

117
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,760
Oh, Mr. Randolph? Yeah?

118
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:51,062
My name is Charles Patrick Donovan.

119
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,464
An agent.

120
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,833
Thanks. Don't you guys ever give up?

121
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,169
The Randolph girl is not available
for public appearances

122
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,620
and that includes television.

123
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,640
Yeah, but this is for only
39 weeks, a half-hour a week.

124
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,175
You get $100,000, almost 100 bucks a minute.

125
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,811
I'm sorry. I don't need the money.
Yeah, but I do.

126
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,582
Good morning, good morning. Ah, Mr. Randolph.

127
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,418
Get in line, bud. I was here first.

128
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:17,155
Mr. Randolph. I represent the
majestic collection agency.

129
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,991
There's come to our attention
a little matter of $1,800

130
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,095
that you owe the united jewelry company
for the purchase of 12 gold bracelets.

131
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,214
Didn't you ever pay them? Why, no, you...

132
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,166
Miss Brooks, that was careless of you.

133
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,318
There'll be a check in the mail tomorrow.

134
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:32,504
Your good man wishes to be paid right now.

135
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,407
Otherwise, I'll have
to repossess the bracelets.

136
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,258
I'm afraid it's rather late for that.

137
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,025
Write him a check for $1,800.

138
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,611
But you haven't got $1,800.

139
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,447
I will have by the first of the month.
Post-date it.

140
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:44,482
If you'll excuse me. Wait a minute.

141
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,252
I thought you didn't need the money. Did I?

142
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,471
Outside the fact that you don't need money,

143
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:52,707
name one good reason why
I can't sign you to this deal.

144
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,665
Well, that's as good a reason as any.

145
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:04,836
Here's your check, my good man.

146
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,071
Thank you.

147
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:09,908
You trying to collect from him too?

148
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,677
Yeah. Just cheated me out of 10 grand.

149
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:17,816
Can I give you a lift?

150
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,785
I'm going to throw myself
off the Brooklyn bridge.

151
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,121
Oh, sorry. I'm going to the Bronx.

152
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,263
Pardon me. But aren't you the Randolph girl?

153
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:34,499
Why yes. But it's supposed to be a secret.

154
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,968
My name is Donovan. I'm
an artist representative.

155
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,537
I think you and I could do business together.

156
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,456
Oh, I'd love to. But I don't
know anything about business.

157
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:45,025
You're just being modest.
I'll get in touch with you

158
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,911
as soon as I, I. What's your name?

159
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,881
Circle 4-1000.

160
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,416
4-1000.

161
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,411
You forget something?

162
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,729
I forgot to say goodbye.

163
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,648
Just a minute. You can't disturb him.

164
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,015
Miss Brooks, you know...

165
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,235
Suppose I said I know who your model was.

166
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,670
I'd say you were bluffing.

167
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:15,173
You know a girl by the name of circle 4-1000?

168
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:16,408
Come in.

169
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23,581
Do me a favor, tear up that number. Sure.

170
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:28,119
But I still got a memory.

171
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,289
It won't do you any good.

172
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,825
She's under an exclusive contract.

173
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,026
She can't make a deal without my permission.

174
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,912
There are many people in this country

175
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:39,314
that are curious about the Randolph girl.

176
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,782
I know some newspaper boys...

177
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,601
Wait, you can't tell the newspapers.

178
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,937
The other 11 will find out.

179
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:47,372
The other 11?

180
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,207
I might as well level with you.

181
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:51,276
There is no Randolph girl.

182
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:53,144
No Randolph girl. But you told me...

183
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,913
There are 12 of them.

184
00:11:54,981 --> 00:11:56,147
Eh?

185
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,866
The Randolph girl is a composite.

186
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:01,469
I use a different model for
each part of her anatomy.

187
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,521
That girl doesn't exist.

188
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:09,594
The hair is Margot's, the eyes are Diane's.

189
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:12,797
The nose is Wendy's, the mouth is Karen's.

190
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:16,301
The chin is sunny's, the neck is Arlene's.

191
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:19,938
The arms are Penelope's,
the torso is Vickie's.

192
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:24,876
The knees are Sandra's, the legs are
Lorraine's, the ankles are Daphne's.

193
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:27,495
Put them all together, they
spell the Randolph girl.

194
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:30,115
That's only 11. What do
you get from the twelfth?

195
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,616
Sympathy.

196
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:34,686
It's amazing how a dozen dames
can keep a secret that long.

197
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,355
Oh, each one of them thinks
she's the whole girl.

198
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,224
You must've your hands full.

199
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:43,094
I not only have to put them together,
I have to keep them apart.

200
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:46,765
Oh, now I get the 12 bracelets.

201
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:50,301
For awhile there, I thought you
had a girlfriend with a long arm.

202
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,905
Say, you'd better go. Daphne is here.

203
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,141
Which one is she? Ankles.

204
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,911
Sometime you ought to tell me what
you do with your spare parts.

205
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:12,190
Little does she know she's
got nothing but ankles.

206
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,346
Hello.

207
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:39,250
Hello, Connie. I didn't get it.

208
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,069
The Randolph deal. It fell through.

209
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,355
Why don't you meet me
somewhere for breakfast?

210
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:46,257
I can't, Chuck. I just got to bed.

211
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:50,562
Ok. If you're not interested in my career,

212
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,464
you know what I'm going to do?

213
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:57,402
I'm going to kill myself.
That's what I'm going to do.

214
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:02,340
Do you hear me? I said
I'm going to kill myself.

215
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,410
Hey, bud. Send her a message
from the spirit world

216
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,679
and give somebody else a chance.

217
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:31,002
Want to know something, Mac?

218
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,604
I'm going to drown myself.

219
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,541
In alcohol.

220
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:36,708
Oh, no, you don't.

221
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:41,579
If I want to drink myself
to death, what do you care?

222
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:45,049
I don't. But you're not going to
drink yourself to death on credit.

223
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:48,486
I see. Now you're turning against
me just like everyone else.

224
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:52,624
Look, Mr. Donovan. I've seen many guys try
to poison themselves with this stuff.

225
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,525
It's a sloppy way of doing it.

226
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:58,363
Not only does it take years, but
it's a very expensive proposition.

227
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,164
You may be right.

228
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,900
Got a pencil and paper?

229
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:02,968
Yeah.

230
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:14,612
Must be other ways of drowning yourself.

231
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:43,441
♪ All the boys are in a whirl every time
they see the girl from Jones beach ♪

232
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,846
♪ She's the kind of a girl who
would fit into anybody's scheme ♪

233
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:54,018
♪ She's out of reach,
the girl from Jones beach ♪

234
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:25,103
Oh, pardon me.

235
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:37,649
Hello?

236
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,950
I found the Randolph girl.

237
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,785
That's interesting. Who is she?

238
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,388
I don't know. She got away and
left her impression in the sand.

239
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:49,794
Listen to this, Height, 5-foot, 6 1/2 inches.
Waist, 24 inches.

240
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,462
Where did you get that figure?

241
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:54,799
I measured how deep the sand was.

242
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:58,336
She's in the locker room now
getting dressed, I think.

243
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,739
I'm watching for her now.

244
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,209
Look, I'll have to hang up. There's
some dame blocking my view.

245
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,715
All yours, ma'am.

246
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,292
Better call the police, we may
have to drag the whole area.

247
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,930
Connie.

248
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,649
I'm so glad you're here,
something awful has happened.

249
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,452
We just found an abandoned rowboat
and I'm afraid that Chuck.

250
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,142
Don't do that. You make me nervous.

251
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:40,945
Now I'll make you nervous.
It's ok, fellas, he's safe.

252
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,847
I'm sorry I troubled you.

253
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,016
No trouble at all.

254
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:48,286
Next time you write such a silly
note, I'll pretend I can't read.

255
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:52,657
I almost did it but this girl
on the beach changed my mind.

256
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,958
What girl?

257
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,794
I'll tell you later.
I have to find her first.

258
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,301
Oh, oh, I'm terribly sorry.

259
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,835
Excuse me.

260
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,871
I don't want her to slip by me.

261
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,539
What does she look like?

262
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:13,010
Well, she's got Lorraine's legs,
Daphne's ankles, Wendy's nose,

263
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,148
Karen's mouth, Sandra's knees, Vickie's...

264
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,585
Has she got anything of mine?

265
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,954
If she has, it didn't show in the sand.

266
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,122
Charles Patrick Donovan.

267
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,632
Ah, we're just wasting our time.

268
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,434
She hasn't shown up in a week.

269
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,102
Then she's just about due.

270
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,844
Hey, quick. Is that the girl?

271
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,651
That's her. How does she look?

272
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,354
Like 12 girls rolled into one.

273
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,888
Hey. I got a bite.

274
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,590
We can't stop for that now.

275
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:03,361
Boy. Look at him fight.

276
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:06,330
He must think today is Friday.

277
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:07,399
Yay-hoo.

278
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:21,279
Pardon me, madam.

279
00:21:41,267 --> 00:21:43,267
Hey, she's disappearing again.

280
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:02,420
Oh, why couldn't one of us be a girl.

281
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,488
You'd look cute.

282
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,497
Sometimes a girl looks
different with clothes on.

283
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:16,535
Hey.

284
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:23,608
No. The facial structure is
similar but not the figure.

285
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:25,776
It's funny, the last time at the entrance,

286
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,345
that same girl came out.

287
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,747
Just a coincidence. But
I'll still follow her.

288
00:22:29,816 --> 00:22:31,248
If you don't hear from me

289
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,050
it's just another coincidence.

290
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:50,768
Quick, follow that car.

291
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,464
Pardon me, could you tell me...

292
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:21,832
Name is Ruth Wilson.

293
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,702
- What does she do...?
- She's a schoolteacher.

294
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,537
How you know what I was going...

295
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,339
Apartment 2-a.

296
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,247
Hi, mother. Woody.

297
00:23:36,315 --> 00:23:38,048
Hello, dear.

298
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:40,317
I wish you'd go to the beach on weekends.

299
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,236
Instead of going an hour before work.

300
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:43,703
It's too crowded on weekends.

301
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,724
She's afraid somebody will
see her in a bathing suit.

302
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,125
Woody.

303
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:49,927
He's right. When I was your age...

304
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:53,798
For the millionth time, I don't want
a man to marry me for my looks.

305
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:58,302
If I hadn't cashed in on my
looks, you wouldn't be here now.

306
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:01,572
Beauty doesn't last.
Intellectual companionship.

307
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:04,408
That's the only thing matters
between a man and a woman.

308
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:07,511
And you spent 500 bucks getting
her teeth straightened.

309
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,248
A girl as pretty as you can't
make herself unattractive to men

310
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,083
no matter how hard she tries.

311
00:24:13,152 --> 00:24:15,402
I haven't had
trouble with men so far, mother?

312
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,589
No. But you haven't had any fun neither.

313
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,894
I'm going to be late for school.

314
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,397
You know what Ruth needs?

315
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:30,034
Yes. But I don't intend
to discuss it with you.

316
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,439
Here's your lunch.

317
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,177
Try not to be too tough
on your sister in class.

318
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:44,582
All right, as long as she doesn't
take advantage of our relationship.

319
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:51,589
- Good morning, I represent the...
- Yes, go on.

320
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,991
Where's your old lady?

321
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,159
I'm Mrs. Wilson.

322
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:57,394
How do you do, Mrs. Wilson.

323
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,430
I represent a national survey.

324
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:01,732
And we're making a little research...

325
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:05,202
This is the first time I'm being
interviewed on one of these polls.

326
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,538
Well, there's always got to be a first time.

327
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:09,807
Well, our question of this week is,

328
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:15,446
do you think that modern girls are less
inhibited than girls of 25 years ago?

329
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,481
On the whole I'd say that girls today

330
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,884
have fewer inhibitions
than their mothers had.

331
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,452
Fewer. But not in this family.

332
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,554
You're supposed to be off to school.

333
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:26,357
All right.

334
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,259
She's the only mother in the family.

335
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:29,927
You know how they get spoiled.

336
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:37,568
Cute kid.

337
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:38,669
Your daughter?

338
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:43,007
Yes. Don't you think she's attractive?

339
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,442
Very. Takes after you.

340
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:49,680
In some ways. But she's much more
conservative than I was at her age.

341
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:50,881
How do you mean?

342
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,683
I used to be in the follies.

343
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:57,922
Oh. Those were the days when
showgirls had something to show.

344
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,557
Very pretty. Thank you.

345
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,125
Is your daughter going to
follow in your footsteps?

346
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:05,713
No. Ruth doesn't want to make a
career of her physical attractions.

347
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,066
She wants to be admired for
her intellectual qualities.

348
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:11,101
She's a schoolteacher.

349
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,336
That explains it.

350
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,405
Explains what?

351
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:16,540
All about, what I mean, what does she teach?

352
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:19,209
Sixth grade grammar at
the Meadowbrook public school.

353
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,778
Sixth grade, eh.

354
00:26:20,846 --> 00:26:25,716
Oh, she teaches in night school also
under the adult education program.

355
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:27,384
A class for new citizens.

356
00:26:28,988 --> 00:26:31,989
Night school.

357
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:34,558
Night school. Night school.

358
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:36,277
Night school. You're off the boat

359
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:39,964
wanting to become a citizen so
you join her class.

360
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:41,832
I already am a citizen.

361
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,267
So you'll vote twice.

362
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:45,502
There must be some easier way to meet her.

363
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:48,038
Why not bump into her
accidentally on the street?

364
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,857
And she'll accidentally call a cop.

365
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,359
Look, I told you what kind of a girl this is.

366
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,378
I've already got 12 girls on my hands

367
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:57,681
each one thinking I ought to
take her out 3 nights a week.

368
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,417
You think they'll believe
I'm going to night school?

369
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:04,088
You want to get rid of them? You
want the hundred grand, don't you?

370
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,306
I couldn't attend that class under my name.

371
00:27:06,307 --> 00:27:08,208
You got a phone book filled with them.

372
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,893
Make sure it's with an accent.

373
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,364
No, that's a crazy idea. All
great ideas sound crazy.

374
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:18,569
They said Marconi was crazy, they said Edison
was crazy, they said Fulton was crazy,

375
00:27:18,638 --> 00:27:21,805
and they'll say that Charles
Patrick Donovan was crazy.

376
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:26,143
I knew if you kept going
you'd come up with something.

377
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:31,281
Venerik.

378
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,385
Good evening. My name is Robert venerik.

379
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,153
Good evening. Good evening.

380
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:40,057
Oh, excuse please. Are you the teacher
for the class from new citizens?

381
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:43,193
No, I'm not. I'm miss shoemaker,
chairman of the school board.

382
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:44,962
Miss Wilson teaches that class.

383
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:48,899
Oh, well, where could I find
the so attractive miss Wilson?

384
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,934
Ah, you'll find her in there.

385
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,437
Thank you.

386
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:56,473
Attractive miss Wilson.

387
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,463
Good evening, class.

388
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:26,871
Abernelli.

389
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,238
Oui. I'm here.

390
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,374
Al Schuller. Is present.

391
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:32,176
Garoux. Si.

392
00:28:32,244 --> 00:28:34,778
Venerik.

393
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:36,146
Venerik.

394
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:39,984
Venerik.

395
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,452
Oh, present.

396
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,024
You're new here, Mr. Venerik, aren't you?

397
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,394
New like anything.

398
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,429
Well, I'd like to welcome you to class.

399
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:53,748
I hope you're happy here.

400
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:57,317
Happy, oh. Like a bird I am happy.

401
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,203
That's very nice.

402
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:02,806
But I can't quite seem to place
your accent, Mr. Venerik.

403
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:05,442
Where are you from?

404
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:07,411
Please, that question I'm not hearing.

405
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:12,599
I asked, what is your nationality?
Where are you from?

406
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,618
Well...

407
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:18,723
Pilsen.

408
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:21,425
Oh, Czechoslovakia.

409
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:25,729
You know, class, the Czechs are made up
of several interesting racial strains.

410
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:29,867
Which are you, Mr. Venerik, Croat or Slovak?

411
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,268
Well, a little of both.

412
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:33,904
Der mama was a Slovak, der papa was a Croat.

413
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:37,941
You may sit down now.

414
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,243
Callaghan. Here.

415
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:41,745
Dimenti. Presente, signora.

416
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:50,821
Please forgive me, Mr. Venerik, but
I'm still just a little puzzled.

417
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,640
You say you're from central Europe?

418
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:55,209
Well, maybe a little to the right.

419
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,928
Yet you look almost Irish to me.

420
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:03,233
Yes. Der mama and der papa on the
way over here stopped by Ireland.

421
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:06,603
Oh, they did. Yes. Begorra.

422
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,839
How long have you been here, Mr. Venerik?

423
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,440
Fresh off boat.

424
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:15,012
It's remarkable how quickly
you? Oh, the cut of your clothes.

425
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,015
Me win suit on radio program.

426
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:20,117
Oh, I see.

427
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:22,953
Tell me, have you found
a job yet, Mr. Venerik?

428
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,489
Oh, no job. A position.

429
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:28,325
So soon? That's wonderful. What do you do?

430
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:29,760
Paint on girls.

431
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:30,727
For a living?

432
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:34,331
Sure. Paint on girls for advertisement.

433
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,366
You need the picture? Draw the pitch.

434
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:40,537
Your accent seems to slide all over Europe.

435
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:45,142
Well, an artist. I'm impressed.

436
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:46,944
- Angstrom.
- Here.

437
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,279
Ashman.

438
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:58,856
Excuse me, miss Wilson. Too late.
Tie up. Subway.

439
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,524
That's quite all right.

440
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:02,526
Oh, by the way, Mr. Stravitch.

441
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:05,529
A fellow countryman of yours
has just enrolled in class.

442
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:07,598
Mr. Stravitch, Mr. Venerik.

443
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:09,366
Mr. Venerik, Mr. Stravitch.

444
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,215
No, my friend, my fellow countryman.

445
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:28,919
We in America now. We speak only American.

446
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,461
- Faciatte.
- Presente.

447
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,296
Vedda. Ja.

448
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:50,540
So you really pulled off
the Randolph deal, eh?

449
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,176
You're smarter than you look, Mr. Donovan.

450
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,945
Well, I hope so. But what I'm...

451
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:57,414
I knew you had it in you, old man.

452
00:31:57,483 --> 00:32:02,152
Shoulder to the wheel. Fight,
fight, fight, for the home team.

453
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,755
Look, it's nothing any
red-blooded American boy

454
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,623
couldn't do with a strong telescope.

455
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:08,390
The whole thing is in your lap now.

456
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:11,028
If you want your dues to the Yale club,

457
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,546
you'd better get a good show.

458
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:15,048
- Yeah, but I, I...
- Yes?

459
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:19,236
Notify all departments to get busy
on the Randolph girl program.

460
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:20,905
We're a well-oiled machine here.

461
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,456
Every little cog doing its job.

462
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:24,741
Look, let's not get our cogs in an uproar.

463
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,245
There's one more detail to be
ironed out. This girl...

464
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,446
Well, now, contract details never bother me.

465
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,548
They never bother you.

466
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,982
Now, start on the publicity.

467
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,550
But we can't do that,
Mr. Randolph won't like it.

468
00:32:34,554 --> 00:32:36,104
Why not? He accepted the offer.

469
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:38,855
Yes. Well, he's got to get
his model's permission first.

470
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,924
And she's got to get her mother's
permission and her mother...

471
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:43,327
Look, it's a large family.

472
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:46,830
Oh, just details. Full steam ahead.

473
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:49,334
Townsend, blemish and Moore
will carry the ball from here.

474
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,969
We ought to have a meeting
with blemish and Moore.

475
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:54,737
They're dead. Ulcers, you know.
Tell them to move over.

476
00:32:54,738 --> 00:32:57,624
Get me Fletcher on the daily express.
What are you doing?

477
00:32:57,643 --> 00:32:59,576
I'm not announcing it officially yet.

478
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,112
Just want to plant in in one of the columns.

479
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,881
Hello, Gil. I've got an exclusive for you.

480
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,551
Charles Patrick Donovan
is going to commit suicide.

481
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,869
Charles Patrick Donovan is going to commit...

482
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,504
No, listen, Gil, that was a mistake.

483
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:27,538
Hello?

484
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:28,573
Hello, Bob?

485
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:29,906
Yeah.

486
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:42,219
I'm sorry, honey, that's
all the information I have.

487
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:43,520
Hello. I mean, goodbye.

488
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,489
You saw the item in Fletcher's column?

489
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:46,958
See it? I've been hearing it.

490
00:33:46,976 --> 00:33:49,326
The girls? Yeah. Now each one of them

491
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:50,828
thinks they'll be a television star.

492
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,629
How you doing with miss Jones beach?

493
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,816
How am I doing what? You've been
going to school long enough.

494
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:58,135
It's time you got started on your homework.

495
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,770
I can't fight both wars.

496
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:02,406
You'll have to take care of
that other front for me.

497
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:05,208
You mean you're dumping
those 12 dames into my lap?

498
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:08,311
That's right. You'll have
to stall them off some way.

499
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,381
That's like playing with dynamite.

500
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,949
When do I start?

501
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:15,085
Right away. Here's my address book.

502
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:22,993
Hair, eyes, nose, mouth,
legs, ankles, knees, torso.

503
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:25,062
Which one do you get sympathy from?

504
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,764
You can find that out for yourself. Great.

505
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,801
This may be a new kind of smorgasbord.

506
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,175
The contract hasn't been signed yet, but...

507
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:43,246
Just as soon as it is, you
can be sure that I'll...

508
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:46,650
Did anyone ever tell you
that you have lovely hair?

509
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,352
Bob thinks it's my best feature.

510
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:54,157
But what I'd like to know is,
what's wrong with the rest of me?

511
00:34:57,062 --> 00:35:00,997
I hope to have that answer
for you within 48 hours.

512
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:03,733
Takes quite a while
to set up a television show,

513
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:08,171
so you have to expect certain
routine delays. And...

514
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,542
That's the most beautiful arm I've ever seen.

515
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:17,247
I have another one just like it.

516
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:23,253
The details haven't been worked out yet,
so you'll just have to sit tight until...

517
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:26,723
Have you ever been to Egypt
and seen the pyramids?

518
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,793
No. Why do you bring that up?

519
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:33,130
Of course, we have no assurance
that the sponsor won't back out.

520
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:37,000
But I'm pretty confident that...

521
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:39,970
I suppose everybody admires your legs.

522
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,471
Just men.

523
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,241
Oh. Well, I'd better be going.

524
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,842
Oh, that's too bad.

525
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:48,078
Yeah. Well, I'll get in touch with you.

526
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:49,147
That'll be nice.

527
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:52,482
I sure had a good time talking to you.

528
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:57,287
Well, if this is your idea of a good
time, don't bother coming back.

529
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:22,612
1863. That was the date of the
emancipation proclamation,

530
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,814
the freeing of the slaves.

531
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:29,319
Can anyone tell me who was the author
of the emancipation proclamation?

532
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:30,388
Mr. Schwarzholz.

533
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:31,555
Abraham Linco-Lin.

534
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,657
That is correct, Mr. Schwarzholz.

535
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:36,159
Only it's pronounced Lincoln, no Linco-Lin.

536
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:41,198
What a language. Lincoln
with an I, knife with a K,

537
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,733
psychology with a P.

538
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:46,269
Mr. Venerik. Miss what?

539
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:51,208
I do wish you'd pay more
attention, Mr. Venerik.

540
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:54,077
Excuse please, miss Wilson,
I was night dreaming.

541
00:36:54,146 --> 00:36:55,996
Did you study the lesson for tonight?

542
00:36:55,997 --> 00:36:58,831
Oh, forward and backwards
and backwards and forwards.

543
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:02,485
Perhaps you could tell me about the
opposing sides in the civil war?

544
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:03,987
It's the Yankees.

545
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:06,223
I appreciate your eagerness, Mr. Callaghan.

546
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:10,227
But I'm asking Mr. Venerik the question.

547
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:13,563
The Yankees and who, Mr. Venerik?

548
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:15,498
And the Dodgers.

549
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,167
Mr. Venerik.

550
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:18,602
Is no?

551
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,303
Decidedly not.

552
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:23,740
Just goes to show. Can't believe
what you read in the newspaper.

553
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:25,909
The rest of the class knows perfectly well

554
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:30,213
that it was the Yankees from the north
and the confederates from the south.

555
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:33,316
Now, I'm going to give you two
minutes during which time

556
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:36,035
you'll please write on your
papers all of the generals

557
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:41,424
of the civil war that you can
think of, both north and south.

558
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:44,361
Ready, begin.

559
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,250
All right, that's all for tonight.

560
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,519
Mr. Schwarzholz, collect the papers, please.

561
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,520
Ja, miss Wilson.

562
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:29,439
The two minutes are up, Mr. Venerik.

563
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:34,811
I think you're taking an unfair advantage.

564
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:40,483
I'll take that paper now, if you don't mind.

565
00:38:46,425 --> 00:38:49,125
Mr. Venerik, I'm not a civil war general.

566
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:52,629
I asked to list the civil war generals.
Why didn't you?

567
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:58,835
Excuse please. But they are
so dead and you are so alive.

568
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,870
I don't know what to do with you.

569
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:03,306
You're not a child. I can't ask you to stay.

570
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:06,776
Oh, yes, you can. Try it.
Well, I'm going home.

571
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:10,880
By Wednesday night, I expect to
know the names of a dozen generals.

572
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,351
Like Grant, Lee, stonewall
Jackson, McClellan, Meade,

573
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,785
Longstreet, Forrest,
Sherman, Sheridan, Pickett.

574
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,721
Why, Mr. Venerik, you do know them.

575
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,323
The name is Robert venerik.

576
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:21,424
Call me Bob.

577
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:23,327
And the president from the confederacy was

578
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:25,496
Jefferson Davis; The vice
president, Judah Benjamin.

579
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:28,164
In Lincoln's cabinet was
Stanton, Seward, chase...

580
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:31,201
Why, Mr. Venerik, you know
all about the civil war.

581
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:36,306
Miss Wilson, 6 times already
I see gone with the wind.

582
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:39,275
Well, I'm going now. They're
expecting me home. Good night.

583
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:43,730
And the presidents from America in the order
were George Washington, John Adams...

584
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:47,299
And then in the year 1803, we bought
from France the Louisiana purchase.

585
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:50,253
Very smart deal. Good buy. And then...

586
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:53,172
Really, you amaze me. You know
all about American history.

587
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:55,742
Don't get me started on
poetry and things like that.

588
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:57,611
Me and Shakespeare are like brothers.

589
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,579
I'm really very impressed, Mr. Venerik.

590
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:00,864
Bob.

591
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:04,534
Bob. I'm very impressed, Bob.

592
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:07,103
I was just thinking.

593
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:09,739
Maybe I could call you and we could go out

594
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:12,509
and have a bite and talk intellectually.

595
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,477
Why, I'd love to.

596
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,312
Thank you, teacher.

597
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:19,516
Well, good night.

598
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,918
Good night.

599
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:23,437
Parting is such sweet sorrow,

600
00:40:23,438 --> 00:40:26,005
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.

601
00:40:26,057 --> 00:40:30,960
Wonderful. How did you
know I love quotations so?

602
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,630
Sleep dwell upon mine eyes,

603
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:35,365
peace in my breast.

604
00:40:35,434 --> 00:40:37,801
Would I were asleep in peace

605
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,302
so sweet to rest.

606
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:42,906
Excellent. Then I call you on the telephone.

607
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:47,710
What a language. Telephone with a p-h.

608
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,479
Good night. Good night.

609
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:56,453
And now we come to the grand
prize question of the evening.

610
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:59,489
How many ms are there
in the word Mississippi?

611
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:04,594
I repeat, How many ms are there
in the word Mississippi?

612
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:08,298
The first contestant to answer
correctly will receive a mink coat,

613
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:12,035
a washing machine, a trip
to Hawaii, a deep freeze...

614
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,453
Hello, everybody. I'm home.

615
00:41:13,454 --> 00:41:15,220
Hello, dear.

616
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,007
Helicopter, a cigarette
lighter, a convertible coupe,

617
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:20,910
a wrist watch, a 5-room house,
an electric blanket...

618
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:26,082
Woody, turn that down. Hello.

619
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,384
Is Bob venerik on this end.

620
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:30,386
I promised to call you, remember?

621
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,222
Yes, but I hardly thought so soon.

622
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,025
Oh, well, it's 6 hours later in pilsen.

623
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:38,361
What are you doing tonight, teacher?

624
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,598
Well, I have no particular plans.

625
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:45,301
Good, because I have. How would
you like to go to Jones's beach?

626
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:48,838
Why, I didn't know anything
went on there at night.

627
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:54,777
Well, there's a moon, there's
an ocean, there's me and you.

628
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:55,896
Something will go on.

629
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,247
Well.

630
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:00,016
Ok, I'll pick you up in two minutes exactly.

631
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:03,487
Who was that?

632
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:06,923
Oh, just a young refugee I met at school.

633
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:08,925
He's coming to take me out.

634
00:42:08,994 --> 00:42:10,344
Aren't you going to change?

635
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:11,778
What for? What for?

636
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:14,731
You want to look nice for
your date, don't you?

637
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:19,135
How proud we are. How fond to show our
clothes and call them rich and new,

638
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:22,839
when the poor sheep and silkworms
wore that very clothing long before.

639
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:26,643
Isaac watts, 1750.

640
00:42:26,711 --> 00:42:28,378
I know a quotation too.

641
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:31,447
You can't catch flies with vinegar.

642
00:42:31,516 --> 00:42:34,016
You make it sound like
I've designs on Mr. Venerik.

643
00:42:34,017 --> 00:42:37,687
Why shouldn't you? Unless there's
something wrong with him.

644
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:39,222
Mr. Venerik is very nice.

645
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,541
But his interest in me
is purely intellectual.

646
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:45,828
That's because you haven't given him
anything else to be interested in.

647
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,398
Maybe I will change.

648
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:50,767
Don't give him any
mother-talk while I'm gone.

649
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:52,001
Why? What do you mean?

650
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,503
You know, how popular I am

651
00:42:53,572 --> 00:42:56,372
and how all the boys
are crazy to take me out.

652
00:42:56,441 --> 00:42:58,841
How it's the first time
in months I've been home.

653
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:03,279
You needn't worry.
I always try to be truthful.

654
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:05,615
I'm sorry, our time is up.

655
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:08,434
None of our contestants answered
the question correctly.

656
00:43:09,487 --> 00:43:12,587
But listen in again next week,
when the prizes will be doubled.

657
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:16,793
Two mink coats, two washing
machines, two trips to Hawaii.

658
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:22,265
Good evening. You must be Mrs. Wilson, eh?

659
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:24,133
And you must be Mr. Venerik.

660
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:26,002
Come in, won't you please?

661
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:33,977
This is my son, Woody.

662
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:36,212
Hello, Woody. Hi.

663
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,450
Won't you sit down?

664
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:41,518
Thank you.

665
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:04,641
Woody, don't you know it isn't polite
to read when there's company present?

666
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:10,797
Ruth said you're her pupil.

667
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,616
Yes. She is teaching me to become a citizen.

668
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:14,685
Oh.

669
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,353
She's got plenty to learn herself.

670
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:20,056
You don't look like the guy who'll teach her.

671
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,458
- Woody.
- Funny boy.

672
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:29,967
Hello.

673
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,036
Woodrow.

674
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:36,906
Well, hello, teacher.

675
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:39,325
I'm so glad you're taking
Ruth out, Mr. Venerik.

676
00:44:39,326 --> 00:44:43,379
This is the first night in months she
hasn't sat home with a good book.

677
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:45,214
It's been a pleasure, Mrs. Wilson.

678
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:47,033
Thank you, Mr. Venerik. Good night.

679
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:48,317
Have a good time.

680
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:52,922
I'm betting 9 to 5 against it.

681
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:55,091
Good night, darling boy.

682
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:57,994
What's the idea?

683
00:44:58,063 --> 00:45:01,264
Oh, excuse please. Just a
pilsen gesture from affection.

684
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:03,132
You're a darling boy.

685
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,638
Darling boy.

686
00:45:11,242 --> 00:45:16,345
You know? Ruth may have a
better time than I thought.

♪ All the boys are in a whirl every time
they see the girl from Jones beach ♪

688
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:27,156
♪ She's the kind of a girl who

689
00:45:30,795 --> 00:45:32,829
Well, we have eaten and we have danced.

690
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,531
Teacher, what for you like to do now?

691
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,366
What for you like to do now?

692
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:38,968
Isn't that Greek phrasing?

693
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:40,536
Well, I have an aunt.

694
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:42,972
My father's sister. She
run away with a Greek.

695
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,942
You would like to walk or sits?

696
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:48,578
Let's sits and listen to the ocean.

697
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:55,752
Well, I'm listening.

698
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:59,589
Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll,

699
00:45:59,657 --> 00:46:03,392
10,000 fleets sweep over thee in vain.

700
00:46:03,461 --> 00:46:05,828
Man marks the earth with ruin.

701
00:46:05,897 --> 00:46:10,066
His control stops with the shore.

702
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,135
Lord Byron wrote that in 1818.

703
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:17,039
1818. Well, he should know
better by this time.

704
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:20,877
In pilsen, that's how a gentleman pays
his respects to a beautiful lady.

705
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,246
How sweet.

706
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:25,448
In Budapest like this.

707
00:46:25,517 --> 00:46:28,451
And further west in Vienna.

708
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,587
And then stop before you get to Paris.

709
00:46:31,656 --> 00:46:32,822
Ok. So I listen.

710
00:46:36,528 --> 00:46:38,694
That couldn't be the waves.

711
00:46:38,763 --> 00:46:42,365
I love to eavesdrop.

712
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:45,434
Now, Charlie, now, Charlie, stop.

713
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,437
To me stop is a traffic signal, that's all.

714
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:53,676
Honestly, Charlie. I'm afraid I'm
going to have to slap your face.

715
00:46:53,745 --> 00:46:55,378
Go right ahead, Sylvia.

716
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:58,214
To me a slap in the face
is an after-shave lotion.

717
00:46:58,283 --> 00:47:00,349
It gives me a tingle.

718
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:03,468
Honestly, Charlie. I don't know
what I'm going to do with you.

719
00:47:03,521 --> 00:47:07,557
After all, you know, this is actually
only our first real date together.

720
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:12,228
What would you think of a girl who let
a fella kiss her on a first date?

721
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:14,463
Listen, when I'm kissing, I'm not thinking.

722
00:47:14,532 --> 00:47:20,469
Last one in the pool is a
lettuce and tomato sandwich.

723
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:22,471
My, but he's the self-confident type.

724
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:26,976
Brrr. Just to think of them swimming in
this night air gives me the shivers.

725
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:31,048
- Sylvia, I mean, teacher...
- Yes?

726
00:47:33,785 --> 00:47:37,954
What is your opinion
from love at first sight?

727
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,156
Let me think.

728
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:42,091
Who was it who said...

729
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,963
Oh, yes, Christopher Marlowe
in hero and Leander.

730
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,532
Whoever loved that loved not at first sight?

731
00:47:49,601 --> 00:47:51,367
Smart boy that Christopher...

732
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:56,572
But on the other hand, John Clarke
in 1639 wrote, and I quote...

733
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:59,809
Love not at the first look. Unquote.

734
00:47:59,878 --> 00:48:03,679
That John Clarke. Who asked him?

735
00:48:03,748 --> 00:48:04,780
Teacher.

736
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:07,383
Yes?

737
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:08,985
Me you like?

738
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,319
Do you like me?

739
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:11,821
I don't understand.

740
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,757
Your speech seems to
wander all over the world.

741
00:48:14,826 --> 00:48:18,094
But your attack is very American.

742
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:22,598
Well, when in Rome, do like
they do at Jones's beach.

743
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:26,286
It's a beautiful evening.

744
00:48:26,287 --> 00:48:28,321
Is that your opinion or Shakespeare's?

745
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,072
Mine, all mine.

746
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:34,110
Speaking from Shakespeare, you're not
the only one that knows quotations.

747
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:36,412
Remember this...

748
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:39,782
No sooner met but they looked,

749
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:43,386
no sooner looked but they loved.

750
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:45,621
But that isn't all of it.

751
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:48,491
No sooner loved but they sighed.

752
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,962
No sooner sighed, but they
asked one another the reason.

753
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:57,800
No sooner knew the reason
but they sought the remedy.

754
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,302
Shakespeare, as you like it.

755
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:01,003
I don't like it.

756
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:02,271
Teacher.

757
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,206
Call me Ruth.

758
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,408
Ruth.

759
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:08,277
Could I say something serious?

760
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:10,746
Yes, Bob. Please do.

761
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:13,950
- Ruth...
- We'll go right home and tell mama.

762
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:15,818
And then we'll go to the printers

763
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:17,937
and we'll have the engagement printed up.

764
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:21,740
And after that we'll go look for
a cute little apartment.

765
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:25,127
Oh, Charlie, I'm so happy. Aren't you?

766
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:32,234
What could have been in that water?

767
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,236
You were about to say?

768
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:38,007
I was about to say it's time we
were thinking of getting home.

769
00:49:38,076 --> 00:49:39,175
Oh.

770
00:49:39,243 --> 00:49:43,646
Please, stop, Sylvia. Please. Sylvia.

771
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,601
Hi, beautiful. Where's your boss?

772
00:49:48,602 --> 00:49:50,102
He's not come down yet.

773
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:54,290
I'll tell him you're here? No,
thanks, I'll wait. I need the rest.

774
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:56,058
I've been on a merry-go-round.

775
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:59,462
I've been going steady with 12 dames at once.

776
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,366
Oh. 13 including Connie.

777
00:50:03,434 --> 00:50:07,269
Say, how come a girl like you isn't married?
Or even engaged?

778
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,138
Well, it's like this.

779
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:11,257
I'm too intelligent for the men I attract

780
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:13,676
and not beautiful enough
for men who attract me.

781
00:50:13,745 --> 00:50:15,795
We know a girl with the opposite problem.

782
00:50:15,796 --> 00:50:17,846
She's gorgeous but she'd rather be smart.

783
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:18,949
Oh, that's no problem.

784
00:50:18,984 --> 00:50:20,583
Good morning, morning.

785
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:22,218
Good morning. Had a good night?

786
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:24,487
I did. What's your problem?

787
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:27,105
Big vitamin man wants
you at a party Saturday night.

788
00:50:27,106 --> 00:50:30,559
Why not? To present the
schoolteacher as the Randolph girl.

789
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:33,062
I'll need more time for that.

790
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:35,431
You mean she hasn't fallen for you yet?

791
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:39,101
If she were the kind who wanted
to be kissed, I could handle her.

792
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:42,805
But what do you do with a girl who
wants to be admired intellectually?

793
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:44,507
Never ran across that kind.

794
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:46,342
Knock on wood.

795
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:47,576
Come in.

796
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,144
Quiet. Quiet.

797
00:51:22,213 --> 00:51:25,063
Now girls, there's no reason
why you can't all be friends.

798
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:26,982
We are now. But what happened?

799
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:29,485
Oh, there's something I forgot to tell you.

800
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:31,353
I lost your address book.

801
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:33,422
You and your gold bracelets.

802
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:34,590
Let's go. Go where?

803
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:36,158
We're walking out on you.

804
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:39,462
You can't do that. Without me
you're just disconnected parts.

805
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,030
I put you together.

806
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,999
There are other guys who'd
like to have the same job.

807
00:51:44,068 --> 00:51:46,368
If you dare use my feet without permission,

808
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,204
I'll sue you from the ankles up.

809
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,272
And my knees too.

810
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:50,773
And don't dare paint my...

811
00:51:50,842 --> 00:51:53,342
Vickie, please. There's a gentleman present.

812
00:51:53,411 --> 00:51:55,144
All right, girls. Let's go.

813
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,683
And don't forget your gold bracelets.

814
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:31,046
Dance, teacher? But this is a samba.

815
00:52:31,115 --> 00:52:33,649
Ah, 1-2-kick, 1-2-kick, it's nothing to it.

816
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,143
Where did you learn how to samba?

817
00:52:44,144 --> 00:52:46,478
Czechoslovakia, naturally.

818
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,531
But that's a dance south of the equator.

819
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:50,900
Well, look.

820
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:53,235
Hey, watch where you're going, bub.

821
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:54,870
I'm sorry.

822
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:58,574
Ok, I'm sorry I'm losing by me the temper.

823
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:00,809
That was strange. What?

824
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:02,811
You spoke without an accent.

825
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,381
Yes, is strange. When I'm losing my temper,

826
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:09,118
I'm losing mine accent.
How could that be? Could a...

827
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:14,957
The music has stopped playing.

828
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:16,792
Well, the music is in my heart.

829
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:18,527
Good evening, boss.

830
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:19,962
Good evening.

831
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:21,397
Good evening?

832
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:24,767
Why, Mr. Randolph, I'm afraid
you've had one too many.

833
00:53:24,835 --> 00:53:25,835
Mr. Randolph?

834
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:28,804
Yes. Well, no. But...

835
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:32,341
It's been nice knowing you.

836
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,410
Teacher, Ruth.

837
00:53:34,478 --> 00:53:35,728
You can drop that accent.

838
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,746
I'm an idiot not to have caught on.

839
00:53:37,815 --> 00:53:39,815
All right, Ruth. Is that better?

840
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:43,586
I don't know why you went through this
ridiculous masquerade, Mr. Randolph.

841
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,454
It is Randolph, isn't it?

842
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:46,689
Yes. Robert Randolph.

843
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:51,060
When I think, Robert Randolph, the artist?

844
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:51,961
Yes.

845
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:53,195
The glamor girl artist?

846
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:55,397
Yes.

847
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:58,067
Really, Mr. Randolph. I don't understand.

848
00:53:58,135 --> 00:54:01,904
Well, if you'll sit down,
I'll explain it to you.

849
00:54:05,676 --> 00:54:08,944
No. Across the table.

850
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:12,014
Yes, teacher. Ruth...

851
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,682
Miss Wilson, if you don't mind.

852
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:16,518
Miss Wilson, I mean, miss Wilson.

853
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,854
It's tough leading a double language.

854
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:21,290
Miss Wilson, this is the approximate truth.

855
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,809
I was visiting your
school to give an art lecture.

856
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:29,231
And I saw you, a schoolteacher, someone who
could give me intellectual companionship.

857
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,532
The idea intrigued me.

858
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,434
Really? How interesting.

859
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:36,839
One glance told me that, you weren't
the kind of girl I could walk up to,

860
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:39,041
and say, my name is Robert Randolph,

861
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,010
what are you doing for dinner tonight?

862
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:43,928
So I investigated, found out
about your class and enrolled.

863
00:54:43,931 --> 00:54:47,316
That's all there is to it.

864
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:50,386
You mean you saw me once and
went through all this trouble?

865
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:53,822
Trouble? I would've gone
through fire and water.

866
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,557
Night school was a cinch.

867
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:59,128
But why? Even my mother doesn't
think I'm a raving beauty.

868
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:00,646
Beauty? A drug on the market.

869
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:04,400
I could look at you and tell
at once you had a beautiful...

870
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,567
Yes?

871
00:55:05,636 --> 00:55:09,004
- Mind.
- A beautiful mind.

872
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:12,808
Oh. But how can you tell?

873
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:18,814
Oh, why, it's simple.
I'm looking at you now and...

874
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:20,616
Do you know what I see?

875
00:55:20,685 --> 00:55:23,719
My beautiful mind?

876
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:27,156
Yes. I could look at it all day long.

877
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:32,928
♪ Because I only have eyes for you... ♪

878
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,497
You're a very unusual man.

879
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:39,535
Why? Because I prefer a well-rounded
thought to a well-turned calf?

880
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:42,304
Oh, that's very admirable.

881
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:48,310
Don't you think that there are times
for thoughts and times for calves?

882
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:50,379
Oh, I have friends who feel that way,

883
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:53,015
but I find the entire
idea revolting, don't you?

884
00:55:53,084 --> 00:55:54,950
Well...

885
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:58,420
You haven't told me whether you
forgive me for posing as Mr. Venerik.

886
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:04,259
Yes, I do. Bob, I'd like to go home now.
I have a terrible headache.

887
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:07,663
Oh, I can understand that,
with all the thinking you do.

888
00:56:07,732 --> 00:56:11,600
Thank you very much Mr. Venerik...
Randolph, I mean, Bob.

889
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:13,202
Your check?

890
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:17,106
No, me no Czech. Me 100% American.

891
00:56:17,174 --> 00:56:18,174
Oh.

892
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:24,913
It's dark in here. You'd better be careful.

893
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,558
Well, good night, Bob, and thank you.

894
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:39,928
Good night and thank you for
a very stimulating evening.

895
00:56:39,997 --> 00:56:42,364
Yes. It's done wonders for my I.Q.

896
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:45,901
If I knew you better, I'd kiss you.

897
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:52,474
Well, if you'd kiss me, you
might get to know me better.

898
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:04,186
It is good to rub and Polish your
mind against the mind of others.

899
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,555
Michel de Montaigne, 1580.

900
00:57:06,624 --> 00:57:09,091
One pulse of passion,
youth's first fiery glow,

901
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,593
are worth the brooded proverbs of a sage.

902
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:13,595
Oscar Wilde, 1885.

903
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:24,973
Robert Randolph, 1949.

904
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:35,617
Is that you, Ruth?

905
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:37,319
Yes, mother.

906
00:57:37,388 --> 00:57:39,455
Did you have a nice time?

907
00:57:39,523 --> 00:57:41,123
Very nice.

908
00:57:41,192 --> 00:57:42,858
Is anything wrong, honey?

909
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:44,560
Oh, mother.

910
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:46,462
Oh, what is it, baby?

911
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,130
What happened?

912
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:51,500
Nothing. Mr. Randolph loves me.

913
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:56,071
Well, for goodness sake, is
that anything to cry about?

914
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:02,277
No. But Mr. Randolph loves me for my brain.

915
00:58:22,633 --> 00:58:24,500
7, 8. That's only 8.

916
00:58:24,568 --> 00:58:26,134
What happened to the other 4?

917
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:28,403
I didn't have any more room, so I thought...

918
00:58:28,439 --> 00:58:32,074
Oh, I get it. It's all right, it's all right.

919
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:34,276
Mr. Donovan? Eh?

920
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:35,978
You're wanted on the telephone.

921
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:39,047
Oh, that must be Bob. Excuse me, honey.

922
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:42,451
Well, hello. Well, hi.

923
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,686
I wanted to ask you, how charming you look.

924
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:48,757
Thank you. I had something on my mind.
My mind.

925
00:58:48,826 --> 00:58:49,993
Where's the Randolph girl?

926
00:58:49,994 --> 00:58:51,894
Oh, now don't you worry, Mr. Evergood.

927
00:58:51,913 --> 00:58:54,313
I promised you Charles
Patrick would've her here.

928
00:58:54,349 --> 00:58:56,999
And he won't go back on my word.

929
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,437
Hello, Bob. Where are you?

930
00:59:02,506 --> 00:59:05,006
That doesn't matter. We're
not coming to the party.

931
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,543
Well, how soon aren't you coming?

932
00:59:07,611 --> 00:59:08,777
What did you say?

933
00:59:08,846 --> 00:59:11,780
I'm calling the whole deal off.
I'm in love with her.

934
00:59:11,849 --> 00:59:15,050
What's that got to do with it?
You asked her to model?

935
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,085
No, I didn't want to break the spell.

936
00:59:17,154 --> 00:59:18,788
I'll discuss it after we're married.

937
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:20,055
But-but this can't wait.

938
00:59:20,124 --> 00:59:22,124
Now look, you've got to choose right now

939
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:24,993
between losing $100,000 or getting married.

940
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:29,531
Should've given him another choice.

941
00:59:31,802 --> 00:59:34,002
Well, what's the matter. Aren't they coming?

942
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:36,521
He decided to marry her first, the coward.

943
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,742
What are you going to do? I'm
seriously contemplating suicide.

944
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:42,744
I mean outside of that.

945
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:46,715
You don't think I have the nerve
to go through with it, do you?

946
00:59:48,052 --> 00:59:51,486
If I had a gun, I'd play Russian roulette...

947
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:53,355
If I was a Russian.

948
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:56,091
Why go to all that trouble? Here.

949
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,261
One of these sleeping pills puts me to sleep.

950
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:02,965
You think I'm bluffing.

951
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:04,466
That's right.

952
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:07,102
What would you give if I took all of them?

953
01:00:07,171 --> 01:00:10,339
What do you usually get?

954
01:00:10,407 --> 01:00:14,076
Here, go ahead. Mix me a glass of hemlock.

955
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:21,183
Not so much.

956
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:23,652
I don't want to go too fast.

957
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:28,523
Well, I might as well be dead

958
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:31,593
after what's going to happen
to my reputation tonight.

959
01:00:39,637 --> 01:00:41,370
Here.

960
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:44,806
People who talk about it, never do it.

961
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:48,143
Go ahead. Make jokes.

962
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:51,546
But after I'm gone, you'll be sorry.

963
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:52,948
That's life.

964
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:05,394
Well, this is it.

965
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:07,596
Well, what you waiting for?

966
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,266
I wish I had a chaser.

967
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:12,968
I knew you'd back out.

968
01:01:13,037 --> 01:01:15,103
You knew I would back out?

969
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:19,908
Think I'm afraid? I, I told
you that at any time, I...

970
01:01:19,977 --> 01:01:21,977
I, I, that's...

971
01:01:31,655 --> 01:01:35,691
I did it.

972
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:36,558
I did it.

973
01:01:36,627 --> 01:01:38,760
It was the only way out, Chuck.

974
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:40,429
But, but I...

975
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:46,201
I'm getting weak.

976
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:52,607
Move closer to me, Connie.

977
01:01:52,676 --> 01:01:55,277
We could have been happy together.

978
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:58,814
But I guess it just wasn't in the cards.

979
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,182
I guess not.

980
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:04,419
Promise me you won't cry for me, Connie.

981
01:02:04,488 --> 01:02:05,587
I promise.

982
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:10,358
I'm slipping fast.

983
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:13,161
Goodbye, Connie. Bye.

984
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,464
Light.

985
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:16,732
Give me more light.

986
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,800
That does it.

987
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:20,836
- I...
- Come off it now, you're not dying.

988
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,538
Who knows better whether
I'm dying, you or me?

989
01:02:23,607 --> 01:02:27,275
I do. All you swallowed
was a glass of champagne.

990
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:30,045
What?

991
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:31,564
I switched the drinks on you.

992
01:02:31,565 --> 01:02:34,700
Of all the dirty tricks I ever...

993
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:37,319
And I was thinking all the...

994
01:02:40,124 --> 01:02:42,691
What?

995
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:47,129
If you, if you gave me the wrong drink,

996
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:50,332
then somebody else has the right one.

997
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,336
I never thought of that.

998
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:04,212
It's poisoned.

999
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:09,284
Lovely party. What did you say?

1000
01:03:09,353 --> 01:03:10,353
Lovely party.

1001
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:11,520
Oh, yes. Sure is.

1002
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:16,291
I think that, pardon me, I...

1003
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:20,729
Here we go again. This time, a toast.

1004
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,605
There's another one.

1005
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,424
Honey, I'm sure we got them all this time.

1006
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:51,026
What's going on here?

1007
01:03:51,094 --> 01:03:52,761
Quick, get him a drink.

1008
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:58,267
Thank you.

1009
01:03:58,302 --> 01:03:59,901
The Randolph girl.

1010
01:04:15,586 --> 01:04:17,552
Care to join me in a drink?

1011
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:18,920
Chuck.

1012
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:25,393
Morning.

1013
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:29,497
A fine stunt you pulled last night.

1014
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:31,333
I'm sorry. You know how it is.

1015
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:32,451
Love before business.

1016
01:04:32,469 --> 01:04:34,035
No, how is it?

1017
01:04:34,104 --> 01:04:36,104
All I know is my career's ruined.

1018
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:37,272
Why, what happened?

1019
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:39,291
Those 12 spare parts of yours turned up

1020
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,727
at that party last night and announced
they were the Randolph girl.

1021
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:46,248
Imagine what a spot that put me
on with evergood and Townsend.

1022
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:47,316
What did you do?

1023
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,751
What could I do? I killed myself.

1024
01:04:56,827 --> 01:04:57,859
Hello?

1025
01:04:57,928 --> 01:04:59,527
Hello. Bob?

1026
01:04:59,596 --> 01:05:02,197
Hey, I was just thinking of you.

1027
01:05:02,266 --> 01:05:03,266
Were you?

1028
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,600
I want to tell you something.

1029
01:05:05,669 --> 01:05:07,769
I have something to tell too.

1030
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:09,905
Can you meet me at Jones beach?

1031
01:05:09,973 --> 01:05:11,306
Of course.

1032
01:05:11,375 --> 01:05:14,676
See you there at the east
bathhouse in an hour.

1033
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:17,712
Right.

1034
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:20,781
In case you missed anything,
I'm invited to a surprise party.

1035
01:05:20,782 --> 01:05:23,618
What will you say when you see
her in a bathing suit?

1036
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:25,520
I'll tell her I love her.

1037
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,422
Even if she is beautiful.

1038
01:05:27,491 --> 01:05:28,791
Oh. I'll be running along.

1039
01:05:28,792 --> 01:05:30,809
Mind if I use your telephone first?

1040
01:05:30,827 --> 01:05:34,596
Go ahead. This time you can
have it all to yourself.

1041
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,106
Hello.

1042
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:45,373
Connie. Did I wake you?

1043
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:46,975
No, I'm still asleep.

1044
01:05:47,044 --> 01:05:48,944
I'm glad you're so sharp this morning.

1045
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,079
There's something I want you to do.

1046
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:53,448
For instance, what?

1047
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:56,017
- Eh.
- Eh.

1048
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:57,719
♪ All the boys are in a whirl ♪

1049
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,388
♪ Every time they see the girl ♪

1050
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:02,207
♪ From Jones beach ♪

1051
01:06:02,225 --> 01:06:03,692
♪ She's the kind of a girl ♪

1052
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,129
♪ Who would fit into anybody's scheme ♪

1053
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:11,466
Suppose you do get her picture
in all the papers, so what?

1054
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:14,469
That will prove to Mr. Townsend
that there is one,

1055
01:06:14,538 --> 01:06:16,571
and only one, Randolph girl.

1056
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:23,478
Hey, here she comes now.

1057
01:06:24,348 --> 01:06:26,781
Bob.

1058
01:06:28,986 --> 01:06:31,753
I've been thinking about
what you said last night.

1059
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:33,388
And before we go any further,

1060
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:35,307
there is something you ought to know.

1061
01:06:35,308 --> 01:06:36,974
Yes?

1062
01:06:37,027 --> 01:06:38,660
Hold that.

1063
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,701
Ruth. Ruth.

1064
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:47,820
Did you arrange this?

1065
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:49,604
I thought it'd be a good idea...

1066
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:51,406
Well, it wasn't.

1067
01:06:53,977 --> 01:06:56,911
2 cents I throw myself in the ocean.

1068
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,116
Come on, spendthrift.

1069
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:10,658
It's outrageous. In my 25
years on the school board,

1070
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:13,328
this is the first time one of our teachers

1071
01:07:13,397 --> 01:07:14,829
has achieved such notoriety.

1072
01:07:14,898 --> 01:07:16,398
Miss shoemaker, let me explain

1073
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:17,498
how it happened.

1074
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,434
It's too late now. The damage is done.

1075
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:22,303
What damage? Many people have
their pictures in the paper.

1076
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,773
Yes, but I'm afraid,
not in a costume like that.

1077
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:28,443
Miss Wilson, we shall have
to ask for your resignation.

1078
01:07:28,512 --> 01:07:29,512
On what grounds?

1079
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:31,246
Our lawyer can best answer that.

1080
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:33,882
Conduct unbecoming a
member of your profession.

1081
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,051
Oh, this is a lot of nonsense.

1082
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:37,185
I will not resign.

1083
01:07:37,254 --> 01:07:39,788
In that case, we shall have to dismiss you.

1084
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:41,956
Go ahead. Fire me.

1085
01:07:42,025 --> 01:07:44,275
You might as well get used to this publicity.

1086
01:07:44,276 --> 01:07:47,911
Because there will be a lot more of it.

1087
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:10,151
This is the modest apartment
house in long island

1088
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,820
where miss Ruth Wilson,

1089
01:08:11,888 --> 01:08:15,123
the stormy petrel of the
teaching profession, resides.

1090
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:17,692
Tomorrow morning in judge Bullfinch's court,

1091
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:20,962
miss Wilson tests her
civil right to teach school,

1092
01:08:21,031 --> 01:08:23,481
even though she looks beautiful
in a bathing suit.

1093
01:08:23,482 --> 01:08:26,601
Miss Wilson, will you make a statement?

1094
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:30,772
I hope to win the right to
continue teaching. Thank you.

1095
01:08:30,841 --> 01:08:32,440
Lots of luck, Ruth.

1096
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:36,444
I know you have the good wishes
of every pupil in America.

1097
01:08:36,513 --> 01:08:39,914
Young man, do you have anything
to say on behalf of your sister?

1098
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:43,651
Well, I always thought my sister
was pretty much a square.

1099
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,320
But after those pictures of her,

1100
01:08:45,321 --> 01:08:47,321
I can see square is the wrong word.

1101
01:08:50,727 --> 01:08:52,560
You see what you've done?

1102
01:08:52,629 --> 01:08:54,629
It's a million bucks worth of publicity.

1103
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,947
Yeah, bad publicity.

1104
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:57,999
She'll lose her case and lose her job.

1105
01:08:58,068 --> 01:09:01,136
In a matter of time she'll lose me.

1106
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:04,873
Hey, unless she wins her case.

1107
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:07,308
Come on. A light went on in my head.

1108
01:09:07,377 --> 01:09:08,643
Turn off the light.

1109
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:12,080
We haven't seen bugs bunny yet. Come on.

1110
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:13,949
The question before this court today

1111
01:09:13,984 --> 01:09:16,234
is the fitness of my client,
miss Ruth Wilson,

1112
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:19,053
to teach school in this community.

1113
01:09:19,122 --> 01:09:21,422
The school board has dismissed
her from her job

1114
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:24,893
due to a number of newspaper
photographs taken at Jones beach.

1115
01:09:24,961 --> 01:09:27,829
We claim there is nothing
immodest about these pictures.

1116
01:09:27,898 --> 01:09:29,664
And to prove our contention,

1117
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:31,933
I should like to introduce into the evidence

1118
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:34,786
the bathing suit that miss
Wilson was wearing at the time.

1119
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:37,138
This is exhibit a.

1120
01:09:37,207 --> 01:09:40,275
Our objection isn't to the suit,
but to miss Wilson in it.

1121
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:44,012
Your honor, the cut and style of this
model certainly have some bearing.

1122
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:47,916
Legally an unfilled bathing suit
is like an empty bottle.

1123
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:51,019
There is no telling what was in it.

1124
01:09:51,087 --> 01:09:52,253
Ruled out.

1125
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:53,721
Call the next witness.

1126
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:57,358
Mr. Robert Randolph.

1127
01:09:57,427 --> 01:09:58,960
Why is he a witness?

1128
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:02,330
He insists on testifying for you.

1129
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:04,265
Then I'm sure to lose.

1130
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:07,434
Mr. Randolph, you are an expert
on feminine beauty, aren't you?

1131
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:10,371
No more so than any other man,
except, I get paid for it.

1132
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,390
What's your opinion of the bathing suit

1133
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:15,176
that miss Wilson was wearing
when she was photographed?

1134
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:16,945
Terrific.

1135
01:10:17,013 --> 01:10:19,263
Any reason why a schoolteacher shouldn't wear

1136
01:10:19,264 --> 01:10:20,465
the same kind of suit?

1137
01:10:20,483 --> 01:10:22,233
I don't believe that schoolteachers

1138
01:10:22,252 --> 01:10:23,852
are different from other people.

1139
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:25,870
Although some of them think they are.

1140
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:27,489
Can you see why the school board

1141
01:10:27,524 --> 01:10:30,124
should object to my client
wearing such a costume?

1142
01:10:30,193 --> 01:10:32,961
No. Except that there have always been people

1143
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:34,529
who've resisted the advance...

1144
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:35,864
Well, rather I should say

1145
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:38,099
the retreat of the bathing suit.

1146
01:10:38,168 --> 01:10:40,968
With your permission, I'd like
to demonstrate that point.

1147
01:10:40,969 --> 01:10:44,922
How? By showing movies of bathing
suits throughout the years.

1148
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:47,675
This is a courtroom, not a theater.

1149
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:50,245
Yes, but your honor, only by showing

1150
01:10:50,313 --> 01:10:53,014
these beautiful girls in their
beautiful bathing suits

1151
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:55,116
can I demonstrate this point.

1152
01:10:55,185 --> 01:10:56,185
Permission granted.

1153
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:58,686
All right, Chuck.

1154
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:00,888
Could you close those blinds, please?

1155
01:11:06,663 --> 01:11:07,913
What's he doing that for?

1156
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:09,814
Hasn't he done enough damage already?

1157
01:11:09,815 --> 01:11:11,549
My dear, this may help our case.

1158
01:11:11,568 --> 01:11:12,867
I don't want his help.

1159
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:15,970
Help refused is hindrance sought and found.

1160
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:17,905
Robert Browning, 1884.

1161
01:11:20,877 --> 01:11:23,111
You're looking at the French riviera.

1162
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:24,612
Last year.

1163
01:11:24,681 --> 01:11:28,416
This year's styles were frankly
too hot to put on celluloid.

1164
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:32,754
In the future, Mr. Donovan,

1165
01:11:32,822 --> 01:11:36,224
a whistle of that nature will cost you $5.00.

1166
01:11:38,328 --> 01:11:40,161
Oh.

1167
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:42,497
Perhaps we ought to make it $10?

1168
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:43,731
It may be worth 5.

1169
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,867
Your honor, is there any law

1170
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:47,835
against a slight smacking of the lips?

1171
01:11:47,904 --> 01:11:52,106
I think not. And please don't distract
my attention from the screen.

1172
01:11:52,175 --> 01:11:54,876
I don't want to miss any of the exhibits.

1173
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:57,945
Your honor, I protest. He's
trying to influence the court.

1174
01:11:58,014 --> 01:12:01,316
Objection overruled. Sit down.

1175
01:12:01,384 --> 01:12:02,950
You're blocking the screen.

1176
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:04,519
Was your father an iceberg?

1177
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:09,190
I ask to compare these
suits with that of miss Wilson.

1178
01:12:09,259 --> 01:12:11,093
Yet undoubtedly, there were
French schoolteachers

1179
01:12:11,094 --> 01:12:12,894
included in the group on the screen.

1180
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:15,296
Here we are now in Atlantic city.

1181
01:12:15,365 --> 01:12:17,131
1935.

1182
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,234
Now these suits seem
harmless enough, don't they?

1183
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:20,985
Compared with present French style.

1184
01:12:20,986 --> 01:12:24,021
Yet they were banned in rye,
New York and Dover, New Jersey.

1185
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:26,074
It is now 1910.

1186
01:12:26,142 --> 01:12:30,812
The one-piece bathing suit
started a minor revolution.

1187
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,113
Women were shocked.

1188
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:34,349
Men took a long view of the situation.

1189
01:12:36,653 --> 01:12:40,054
And now we come to the
early days of the new century.

1190
01:12:40,123 --> 01:12:41,723
Take a look at those costumes.

1191
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:44,092
Anything there to object to?

1192
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:47,995
Yet even this period had its bluenoses.

1193
01:12:48,064 --> 01:12:50,164
See those policemen coming on the scene?

1194
01:12:50,233 --> 01:12:54,035
Well, they are coming to arrest
these overdressed young women...

1195
01:12:54,104 --> 01:12:55,269
For indecent exposure.

1196
01:13:01,111 --> 01:13:02,677
Why, that's Emma.

1197
01:13:02,746 --> 01:13:04,078
Emma shoemaker.

1198
01:13:04,147 --> 01:13:05,913
It isn't, it is not.

1199
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:08,649
Yes, it is. Emma shoemaker.

1200
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:13,588
Silence. Silence in the courtroom.

1201
01:13:13,656 --> 01:13:15,223
Turn that contraption off.

1202
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:21,162
Now, who was responsible for that outburst?

1203
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:24,432
Better fess up now,
or the penalty will be double.

1204
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:26,968
Who shouted in the courtroom?

1205
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:28,903
Your honor, it was you.

1206
01:13:28,972 --> 01:13:32,740
What on earth are you talking? Oh...

1207
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:34,675
Come to think of it, it was me.

1208
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,345
And that was Emma shoemaker up on the screen

1209
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:39,164
hitting that policeman on the head.

1210
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:42,834
It, it wasn't, it couldn't
have been. I'm not that old.

1211
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:44,352
Yes, you are, Emmy.

1212
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:47,789
That's the most dishonorable
thing I ever heard.

1213
01:13:47,857 --> 01:13:52,960
Emmy, are you forgetting that I
was your lawyer on that case?

1214
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:57,298
No. I'm not forgetting.

1215
01:13:57,367 --> 01:13:59,417
I'm not forgetting that my father thought

1216
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:02,286
you were a terrible lawyer,
and wouldn't let me marry you.

1217
01:14:02,287 --> 01:14:03,738
You know it was my mother

1218
01:14:03,807 --> 01:14:05,406
who wouldn't let me marry you.

1219
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:08,709
A girl who wore such a
shocking costume on the beach.

1220
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:14,015
Emmy, what are you doing for dinner tonight?

1221
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:15,817
I'd love to, Johnny.

1222
01:14:18,488 --> 01:14:20,188
Silence.

1223
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:22,590
Silence in the courtroom.

1224
01:14:22,659 --> 01:14:23,891
Proceed with the case.

1225
01:14:23,894 --> 01:14:25,994
Now that you've seen the kind of beachwear

1226
01:14:25,995 --> 01:14:27,345
people opposed in the past,

1227
01:14:27,346 --> 01:14:28,746
I should like to reintroduce

1228
01:14:28,765 --> 01:14:30,515
the bathing suit worn by my client.

1229
01:14:30,516 --> 01:14:33,317
I have already ruled on that.
I know, your honor.

1230
01:14:33,336 --> 01:14:36,437
But this time, I think we can
overcome your objection.

1231
01:14:42,445 --> 01:14:44,078
Exhibit a.

1232
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:57,658
Mark that exhibit double a.

1233
01:14:57,727 --> 01:14:59,494
You got two tens for a twenty?

1234
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:05,566
Unless we have order,
I'll clear the courtroom.

1235
01:15:05,635 --> 01:15:09,303
You don't want to be in the
lobby at a time like this.

1236
01:15:09,372 --> 01:15:10,738
Your honor,

1237
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:13,307
is there anything improper
about this bathing suit?

1238
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:17,895
Oh, no, no. It's very proper. And fitting.

1239
01:15:17,914 --> 01:15:20,047
Your honor, I realize that a bathing suit

1240
01:15:20,116 --> 01:15:22,083
belongs on a beach, not in a courtroom.

1241
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:24,252
But I was merely trying to prove

1242
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,954
that a schoolteacher
belongs in a bathing suit

1243
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,757
just as much as any other girl.

1244
01:15:29,826 --> 01:15:32,393
It took me a long time to discover it.

1245
01:15:32,462 --> 01:15:34,228
I don't think a man enjoys putting

1246
01:15:34,297 --> 01:15:37,999
his arm around a woman's mind.

1247
01:15:38,067 --> 01:15:39,867
We're entitled to our private lives.

1248
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:43,287
And instead of just teaching history,

1249
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:46,274
we should be allowed to make
a little of our own.

1250
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:57,051
Miss Wilson, all I can say is

1251
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,288
I wish I'd had a teacher like you.

1252
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:03,457
After a careful examination of the evidence,

1253
01:16:03,526 --> 01:16:05,693
the judgment of this court is

1254
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:09,263
that miss Wilson should be reinstated.

1255
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:12,500
And I hereby order the board
to comply with this decision.

1256
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:17,738
Class dismissed.

1257
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:19,974
I mean adjourned.

1258
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:24,178
Hey, let's close that television deal now?

1259
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:26,047
How can you think about money?

1260
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:27,214
It's very easy.

1261
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:31,886
Chuck, do me a favor.

1262
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:33,788
Ask the judge if he'll stick around.

1263
01:16:33,856 --> 01:16:35,122
You going to marry Ruth?

1264
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:37,658
If I can get close to her.

1265
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,124
Chuck, where are you going?

1266
01:17:10,193 --> 01:17:12,243
I'm going to arrange a marriage ceremony.

1267
01:17:12,244 --> 01:17:14,779
Oh, you never even asked me.

1268
01:17:14,797 --> 01:17:17,264
Oh, we could make it a double wedding.

1269
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:18,683
Maybe we'll get a discount.

1270
01:17:18,684 --> 01:17:20,785
Why don't we all go on a honeymoon?

1271
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,336
Hey, that's an idea.

1272
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:25,406
You and Ruth in one room,
and Bob and I the other.

1273
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:27,942
Chuck, who are you kidding?
