1
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:42,112
Came to our planet
thousands of years ago.

2
00:01:42,114 --> 00:01:44,214
What people don't realize
is that they irrevocably

3
00:01:44,216 --> 00:01:46,049
altered our reality.

4
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:47,818
What was will never be,

5
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,953
and what will be isn't.

6
00:01:50,889 --> 00:01:52,889
I'm not sure I
follow you there.

7
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:53,907
Oops.

8
00:01:53,908 --> 00:01:54,924
They
shifted the very fabric

9
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:55,927
of space and time.

10
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:58,295
Ew.

11
00:01:58,297 --> 00:02:00,030
Time-traveling aliens.

12
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:01,098
Are
they aliens, Bob?

13
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,933
Or are they us.

14
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:04,134
All right, goodbye.

15
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,604
You
call it masculinity,

16
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:09,839
but what it really is, let's
be honest, it's chauvinism.

17
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:11,108
Here we go.

18
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,009
Men
are taught to conquer.

19
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:15,512
You find it all across
history and theology.

20
00:02:15,514 --> 00:02:17,197
Hades abducts Persephone

21
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:18,881
and takes her to the
underworld to be his bride.

22
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:21,752
Her father even
allows it to happen,

23
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,220
and speaking of father,

24
00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:24,921
Helen of Joyce was
afraid her beauty

25
00:02:24,923 --> 00:02:26,456
would start a war
amongst her suitors,

26
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,258
only to have her abducted, raped

27
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,227
and to start a war anyway.

28
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:31,828
After that we have the Romans,

29
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,096
- no improvement there.
- Next.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,932
It's not
just about the orgasm for her.

31
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:37,934
Now we're talkin'.

32
00:02:39,687 --> 00:02:41,437
It's
intimacy she's missing.

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,340
She wants to be close to you,

34
00:02:43,342 --> 00:02:46,209
not just sexually
but emotionally.

35
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:48,311
That's the connection
you need to build.

36
00:02:48,313 --> 00:02:49,813
So you
mean like talk to her about

37
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:51,982
feelings and stuff
while we're doing it?

38
00:02:55,287 --> 00:02:58,054
Harris, come in.

39
00:02:58,056 --> 00:02:59,823
You've reached the
empty shell of the man

40
00:02:59,825 --> 00:03:00,991
who used to be Harris.

41
00:03:00,993 --> 00:03:02,959
How may I be of service
to you, my liege?

42
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:05,362
What's
your ETA on that pick up?

43
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:10,233
Fuck you.

44
00:03:10,235 --> 00:03:12,836
What was that?

45
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:15,138
I'm here, I think.

46
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,541
Passenger give any better
description than county line 10

47
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:18,942
north of 83?

48
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:20,110
Like what?

49
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:21,945
I don't know,
mile marker, a sign,

50
00:03:21,947 --> 00:03:24,981
maybe a cactus shaped
like a giant dildo.

51
00:03:24,983 --> 00:03:26,817
They're
all shaped like dildos.

52
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,352
Well, that's true.

53
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:29,886
Just drive
around until you either find her

54
00:03:29,888 --> 00:03:33,256
or the hill mutants descend
upon the cab and devour you.

55
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:35,992
Make sure they don't
scratch the interior.

56
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:36,994
Roger that.

57
00:03:42,868 --> 00:03:43,500
What do you know?

58
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:44,935
Not a prank after all.

59
00:03:58,584 --> 00:03:59,883
Call for a cab, Miss?

60
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:02,586
I sure did.

61
00:04:02,588 --> 00:04:04,338
Please tell me you
have heat in there.

62
00:04:04,339 --> 00:04:06,089
As long as you don't
mind the smell of burning.

63
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:07,190
I'll take burning over freezing.

64
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:09,125
Don't say I didn't warn you.

65
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:17,434
So where we headed?

66
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,037
Corner of Elm and
River Drive, please.

67
00:04:21,974 --> 00:04:24,074
One middle of nowhere
comin' right up.

68
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:55,105
You're right, that
smells like burning.

69
00:04:55,107 --> 00:04:56,139
You warm enough yet back there?

70
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:56,973
I am.

71
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:58,074
All right.

72
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:04,080
So what's your name?

73
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:05,282
Harris.

74
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:06,516
Can I call you Harry?

75
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:08,151
Please never do that.

76
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:10,754
Okay.

77
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:12,488
Harris, how long have
you been driving?

78
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:13,924
16 years.

79
00:05:13,926 --> 00:05:16,026
Although some nights
it feels like forever.

80
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:17,460
You must like the road.

81
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:19,062
I don't hate it.

82
00:05:19,064 --> 00:05:20,563
Does it ever get boring?

83
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:22,032
Occasionally.

84
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:23,533
What do you do to pass the time?

85
00:05:23,535 --> 00:05:26,436
You know, when not engaged
in riveting conversation

86
00:05:26,438 --> 00:05:27,637
with one of your fares.

87
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,172
Games mostly.

88
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:31,508
What kind of games?

89
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,077
Like, like I got
this one where I see

90
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,719
how many green lights
I can catch in a row

91
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:38,899
before hittin' red.

92
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,220
I never said there
were fun games.

93
00:05:41,153 --> 00:05:42,018
12.

94
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,953
Huh?

95
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:44,287
12 green lights in a row.

96
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:46,056
That's my record.

97
00:05:46,058 --> 00:05:47,558
Your game's not original.

98
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:49,059
It's respectable,
not brag worthy.

99
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:51,027
You've done more than
12 green lights in a row?

100
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:52,495
How many?

101
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:54,130
See, if I told you you'll
feel bad about yourself.

102
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:55,165
How many?

103
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:56,032
23.

104
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:58,201
wow, I concede defeat.

105
00:05:58,203 --> 00:05:59,269
As you should.

106
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,373
My name is Penny, by the way.

107
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:04,541
Like the coin?

108
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,476
Yeah, just like the coin.

109
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:19,089
So what do you
do, Penny like the coin?

110
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:20,023
I'm sort of in between jobs.

111
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:21,291
Right now I teach part-time.

112
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:23,159
Wait, wait, wait, don't tell me.

113
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:24,661
Literature?

114
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:26,629
Art, history of DC Comics

115
00:06:26,631 --> 00:06:28,665
with a focus on
the Jack Kirby years?

116
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:32,068
Is that a real thing?

117
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,270
It was a blow off
course seniors could take

118
00:06:34,272 --> 00:06:35,472
in my high school.

119
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:39,242
Hey, I thought Kirby
worked for Marvel.

120
00:06:40,712 --> 00:06:42,045
He was at Marvel first

121
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:44,114
but went over to DC
in the early '70s.

122
00:06:44,116 --> 00:06:45,015
Very good though.

123
00:06:45,017 --> 00:06:46,383
Well, thank you.

124
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:50,520
You obviously took
that blow off class,

125
00:06:50,522 --> 00:06:52,155
and you paid attention.

126
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:55,058
So what do you teach,
Penny like the coin?

127
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,692
I teach dancing.

128
00:06:55,694 --> 00:06:58,261
Ah, so close.

129
00:06:59,498 --> 00:07:00,730
What kind of dance?

130
00:07:00,732 --> 00:07:02,766
The kind where you
take your clothes off.

131
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,604
It's funny, that's usually
a conversation starter.

132
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:09,706
I guess I never realized
there was much of a demand

133
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:11,141
for teaching people
how to strip.

134
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:12,709
I sort of figured, you know,

135
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,276
you just take it
off and shake it.

136
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,112
Next time you're
in front of a mirror,

137
00:07:16,114 --> 00:07:17,614
why don't you try that,

138
00:07:17,616 --> 00:07:20,450
and then ask yourself how much
would you pay to watch you.

139
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:23,653
I would probably pay
me to keep my clothes on.

140
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:26,322
Maybe one day you should
come by for a lesson.

141
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:27,390
I'm serious.

142
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:28,425
It's a confidence builder.

143
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:29,692
So is gettin' drunk.

144
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:31,728
Yeah, but who do you
do your drinking with?

145
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,396
Just me.

146
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:34,597
And you're right,
it's the company

147
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:35,598
that makes the difference.

148
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,133
I would say so.

149
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,603
So, Penny like the coin,

150
00:07:42,707 --> 00:07:44,174
you got a dance partner?

151
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:48,278
Hey Harris.

152
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:51,781
Go for Harris.

153
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:53,348
Been some bad
weather reports in your area.

154
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:55,585
Yeah I see it looks
like a thunderstorm.

155
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:57,720
Come
back to the city limits

156
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:59,255
after your drop off.

157
00:07:59,257 --> 00:08:00,423
Roger that.

158
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:04,694
Is that your boss?

159
00:08:04,696 --> 00:08:06,196
Yeah.

160
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:07,297
Dispatcher.

161
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:08,698
He sounds pleasant.

162
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:13,970
He is not.

163
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:15,270
We're just a few minutes out.

164
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:21,311
Whoa.

165
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:23,379
Y'all right back there?

166
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:41,564
Goddamn piece of shit.

167
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,241
Harris to dispatch.

168
00:08:51,243 --> 00:08:52,275
Yeah, go.

169
00:08:52,277 --> 00:08:53,376
Ah.

170
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:55,411
What is it?

171
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:58,181
I'm not sure.

172
00:08:58,183 --> 00:08:59,916
My
coffee's burning.

173
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:02,185
My passenger.

174
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:03,786
I'm enjoying
this game as much as you are.

175
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:05,255
She disappeared.

176
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:06,289
She ditched?

177
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:07,423
No, she...

178
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:08,591
She what?

179
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:10,627
She sure as hell didn't
beam out of there.

180
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:11,528
She kinda did.

181
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,363
You
been hittin' the sauce?

182
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:14,864
What do you think?

183
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:16,332
Well, if
you haven't been drinking,

184
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:18,668
then I guess she got
abducted by aliens.

185
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,236
Appreciate that.

186
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:21,404
You
sure she didn't ditch?

187
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:22,672
I'm quite sure.

188
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:24,240
I don't
know what to tell ya.

189
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:26,176
There's no protocol for this.

190
00:09:26,178 --> 00:09:28,244
Reset the meter
and come back in.

191
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:29,312
Call this one a wash.

192
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:32,348
Wait, that's it.

193
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,317
What else is there?

194
00:09:39,624 --> 00:09:41,224
I'm headed back.

195
00:09:41,226 --> 00:09:42,692
That's a roger.

196
00:09:56,775 --> 00:09:57,974
What
they don't realize

197
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:00,376
is that they irrevocably
altered our reality.

198
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:02,212
What was will never be,

199
00:10:02,214 --> 00:10:03,880
and what will be isn't.

200
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:06,783
I'm not
sure I follow you there.

201
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,318
They
shifted the very fabric

202
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,286
of space and time.

203
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:12,422
Time-traveling aliens?

204
00:10:12,424 --> 00:10:13,823
Are
they aliens, Bob?

205
00:10:13,825 --> 00:10:15,491
Or are they us?

206
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:17,827
Garbage.

207
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:18,661
men have
the right to be pissed off.

208
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:20,363
You call it masculinity,

209
00:10:20,365 --> 00:10:23,366
but what it really is, let's
be honest, is chauvinism.

210
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:25,468
Men are taught to conquer.

211
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,304
We find it all across
history and theology.

212
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:30,607
Hades abducts Persephone and
takes her to the underworld

213
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:31,574
to be his bride.

214
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:33,309
I really hope that's soda.

215
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:35,311
Her father
even allows it to happen.

216
00:10:35,313 --> 00:10:36,579
And speaking of father,

217
00:10:36,581 --> 00:10:38,281
Helen of Joyce was
afraid her beauty

218
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:39,782
would start a war amoungst her suitors,

219
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,784
only to have her
abducted, raped,

220
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:43,553
and to start a war anyway.

221
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:44,387
After that we have...

222
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:45,488
All right, bye.

223
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:49,292
It's not
just about the orgasm for her.

224
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:50,793
Yeah.

225
00:10:50,795 --> 00:10:51,928
You're
focusing on the wrong thing.

226
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,497
It's the intimacy she's missing.

227
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:56,432
- She wants to be close to you.
- Of course.

228
00:10:56,434 --> 00:10:59,435
Not just
sexually, but emotionally.

229
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:01,638
That's the connection
you need to build.

230
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,872
So you
mean like talk to her

231
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:05,742
about feelings and stuff
while we're doing it?

232
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,046
Harris, come in.

233
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:11,347
You've reached the
empty shell of the man

234
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:12,515
who used to be Harris.

235
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:14,751
How may I be of service
to you, my liege?

236
00:11:14,753 --> 00:11:16,519
Do you
even know what a liege is?

237
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:18,888
Yeah, it's like a lord.

238
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,024
What's
your ETA on that pick up?

239
00:11:22,327 --> 00:11:23,459
Ooh.

240
00:11:23,461 --> 00:11:24,661
Fuck me.

241
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,763
Kiss me first.

242
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:28,364
I'm here, I think.

243
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:29,799
Passenger give any
better description

244
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,335
than county line
10, north of 83?

245
00:11:32,337 --> 00:11:33,603
Like what?

246
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:34,971
I don't know, a
mile marker, a sign,

247
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:37,507
maybe a cactus shaped
like a giant dildo?

248
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:40,743
Actually, scratch that they're
all shaped like dildos.

249
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:41,711
Just drive around

250
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:43,513
like the idiot that you are,

251
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:45,548
'til you either find her
or the ground underneath

252
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,084
breaks open and swallows
you into its gaping maw.

253
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:50,386
And don't let it
scratch the paint job.

254
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:51,621
Roger that.

255
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,729
Huh.

256
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:00,731
Not a prank.

257
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:17,380
You call for a cab, Miss?

258
00:12:17,382 --> 00:12:18,898
Yes, I did.

259
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,415
Please tell me you
have heat in there.

260
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:21,884
As long as you don't
mind the smell of burning.

261
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:23,853
I'll take it over freezing.

262
00:12:23,855 --> 00:12:26,489
Don't say I didn't warn you.

263
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:32,762
So where are we headed?

264
00:12:33,932 --> 00:12:36,699
Corner of Elm and
River Drive, please.

265
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:37,900
So middle of nowhere.

266
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:41,571
Yeah.

267
00:12:59,724 --> 00:13:03,126
You're right, that
smell's like burning.

268
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:11,501
So your name's Harris?

269
00:13:11,503 --> 00:13:12,503
Yes, ma'am.

270
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:15,104
Can I call you Harry?

271
00:13:15,106 --> 00:13:16,706
Not if you want an answer.

272
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:19,575
All right, Harris.

273
00:13:20,545 --> 00:13:22,145
Do you like driving a cab?

274
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:23,146
I don't hate it.

275
00:13:23,148 --> 00:13:24,881
Doesn't it get repetitive?

276
00:13:24,883 --> 00:13:27,183
Not when I'm engaged
in riveting conversation

277
00:13:27,185 --> 00:13:28,584
with one of my fares.

278
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:33,423
Riveting, that's
a lot of pressure.

279
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:35,658
Ah, you seem up for the task.

280
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,427
Okay.

281
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:39,629
What should this riveting
conversation consist of?

282
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:41,831
Whatever you like,
miss, it's your ride.

283
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:44,600
I'd like to know
something about you.

284
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:45,568
I drive a cab.

285
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,803
See, I already knew that.

286
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:50,072
Come on, tell me
something unique.

287
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:51,641
Unique.

288
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:52,842
Everybody's got something
unique about them.

289
00:13:52,844 --> 00:13:55,645
Well, in high
school I took a class

290
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:57,580
on the history of DC comics

291
00:13:57,582 --> 00:13:59,115
with the focus on
the Jack Kirby years.

292
00:13:59,117 --> 00:14:00,117
It's unique.

293
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:03,953
Yeah, well, that is unique.

294
00:14:04,823 --> 00:14:06,522
Although it's also trivial.

295
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:08,541
What, how so?

296
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:10,559
Well, you completed the
assignment by telling me something

297
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:14,564
about yourself that's
specific and unusual,

298
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:18,034
and therefore you satisfy the
definition of the word unique,

299
00:14:18,036 --> 00:14:19,702
but in doing so you
didn't actually tell me

300
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:21,170
anything about you.

301
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:22,605
Except that I like Jack Kirby.

302
00:14:22,607 --> 00:14:25,808
Yeah, but, so do
you like Jack Kirby

303
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,243
because you're a comic book fan,

304
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:28,945
or do you actually
like Jack Kirby

305
00:14:28,947 --> 00:14:32,148
because you yourself are
a disenfranchised crank.

306
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,150
Oh, whoa whoa whoa, feisty.

307
00:14:34,152 --> 00:14:36,486
That would have
been something unique.

308
00:14:36,488 --> 00:14:38,554
How do you know
so much about Kirby?

309
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:39,789
Well, maybe I
took that class too.

310
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:40,791
Oh.

311
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:43,559
Well, all right then.

312
00:14:43,561 --> 00:14:44,560
Well, what about you?

313
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:45,761
It's your turn.

314
00:14:45,763 --> 00:14:46,829
What about me?

315
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:48,030
What do you wanna know?

316
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:49,665
Well, let's start
with what is your name.

317
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:04,780
Shit.

318
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:07,783
Penny, are you all right?

319
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:14,957
I didn't tell you my name.

320
00:15:17,562 --> 00:15:19,862
I didn't tell you
my name this time.

321
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:22,131
We must've hit an
animal or something.

322
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,666
You remembered me.

323
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:25,701
Just now you remembered me.

324
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:26,703
Harris!

325
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:32,742
Do you remember me?

326
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:36,679
Harris,
what's going on?

327
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:37,681
Why are you stalled?

328
00:15:40,685 --> 00:15:42,051
We hit something.

329
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:44,053
It must've run off.

330
00:15:44,055 --> 00:15:45,821
Did
it damage the cab?

331
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:48,891
Harris.

332
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:50,993
Harris, remember me this time.

333
00:15:56,634 --> 00:15:58,568
What the
hell's going on over there?

334
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,570
Fuck it.

335
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:02,305
Harris?

336
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:03,639
I...

337
00:16:03,641 --> 00:16:04,774
I don't know.

338
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,642
I lost my fare.

339
00:16:06,644 --> 00:16:07,677
What?

340
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,844
Did she ditch?

341
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,714
Goddamn it, my
seat belt's stuck!

342
00:16:11,716 --> 00:16:12,915
Whoa, all right.

343
00:16:12,917 --> 00:16:14,350
Keep your shirt on.

344
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:17,320
Just call this one a wash, okay.

345
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:19,922
Looks like you got some bad
weather rolling in over there.

346
00:16:19,924 --> 00:16:23,025
Bring the cab back
into the city limits.

347
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:24,093
That's a roger.

348
00:16:25,363 --> 00:16:26,729
You
all right there?

349
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:28,264
Not really.

350
00:16:29,734 --> 00:16:31,667
Don't
forget to reset your meter.

351
00:17:26,758 --> 00:17:28,741
Through
government grants

352
00:17:28,742 --> 00:17:30,725
we came to the
conclusion that these

353
00:17:30,728 --> 00:17:33,029
so-called extraterrestrials
came to our planet

354
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:35,097
thousands of years ago.

355
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:36,298
What people don't
realize is they

356
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,701
irrevocably altered our reality.

357
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:40,736
What was will never be,

358
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:42,405
and what will be isn't.

359
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:45,307
I'm not
sure I follow you there.

360
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:46,842
They
shifted the very fabric

361
00:17:46,844 --> 00:17:48,944
of space and time.

362
00:17:48,946 --> 00:17:51,180
Time traveling aliens.

363
00:17:51,182 --> 00:17:52,782
Are
they aliens, Bob?

364
00:17:52,784 --> 00:17:53,883
Or are they us?

365
00:17:56,788 --> 00:17:57,420
Harris, come in.

366
00:17:57,422 --> 00:17:58,754
Go for Harris.

367
00:17:58,756 --> 00:17:59,722
That was fast.

368
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:01,390
What's your ETA on that pick up?

369
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:02,825
ETA.

370
00:18:02,827 --> 00:18:03,459
Yeah, ETA.

371
00:18:03,461 --> 00:18:04,960
What are you high?

372
00:18:04,962 --> 00:18:06,228
Weather reports in
your area aren't pretty

373
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,932
and they're getting
uglier by the minute.

374
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:11,835
Hello.

375
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:13,820
I'm here.

376
00:18:13,821 --> 00:18:14,904
Yeah, I see the
weather up ahead.

377
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:16,739
I'm almost to the pickup.

378
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:17,740
Keep me posted.

379
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:19,108
Will do, roger that.

380
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:26,850
Huh.

381
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,899
Please tell me you
have heat in there.

382
00:18:45,236 --> 00:18:47,303
As long as you don't
mind the smell of burning.

383
00:18:47,305 --> 00:18:48,938
I'll take that over freezing.

384
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,950
Where we headed?

385
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,051
Corner of...

386
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:03,213
BOTH: Elm and River Drive.

387
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:05,855
Middle of nowhere.

388
00:19:29,347 --> 00:19:30,913
You're right, that
smells like burning.

389
00:19:30,915 --> 00:19:32,047
Smells like burning.

390
00:19:39,924 --> 00:19:40,956
Do you remember me?

391
00:19:48,065 --> 00:19:51,033
I'm sorry, but
have we met before?

392
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:53,135
I don't think so.

393
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:54,870
It's just I'm
pretty good with faces

394
00:19:54,872 --> 00:19:56,372
and you seem so familiar.

395
00:19:56,374 --> 00:19:57,473
I do?

396
00:19:57,475 --> 00:19:58,475
Very much.

397
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:09,919
You know, I've had the
worst deja vu all night.

398
00:20:09,921 --> 00:20:11,520
Like I can predict what
the radio is gonna say.

399
00:20:11,522 --> 00:20:12,922
You have ever have
one of those nights?

400
00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:13,556
Not really.

401
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:14,824
Not really, okay.

402
00:20:18,496 --> 00:20:19,428
Harris, your name's Harris.

403
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:20,361
Please don't call me Harry.

404
00:20:20,364 --> 00:20:21,864
You were gonna ask
me that, weren't you?

405
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:24,433
See, I knew that,
how did I know that?

406
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:25,901
Were you gonna ask me that?

407
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:26,535
No.

408
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:27,537
No, okay.

409
00:20:28,973 --> 00:20:31,006
What's your name?

410
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:32,008
Penny.

411
00:20:32,877 --> 00:20:33,943
Like the coin.

412
00:20:34,846 --> 00:20:36,045
What?

413
00:20:36,047 --> 00:20:37,446
Like the coin.

414
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:39,114
That's what we always
say, like the coin,

415
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:42,218
and then you ask me
if I like driving.

416
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,855
And then we talk about Jack
Kirby and traffic lights

417
00:20:45,857 --> 00:20:49,358
and high school and stripping.

418
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,026
Ha!

419
00:20:51,028 --> 00:20:52,962
I do know you.

420
00:20:52,964 --> 00:20:54,296
We been here before,
the two of us,

421
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:56,232
me driving you just like this.

422
00:20:57,335 --> 00:21:00,002
And then we always
hit bad weather,

423
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:01,971
and that's when you
disappear from the cab.

424
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:06,076
Am I crazy?

425
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:08,177
Do you think you're crazy?

426
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,380
I sure as hell sound crazy.

427
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:13,115
How are you doing this?

428
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:15,084
How is this happening
all of a sudden?

429
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,319
You've never remembered
anything about...

430
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:18,654
So I'm right?

431
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:19,622
We been here before.

432
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:21,423
I am right, I am right!

433
00:21:21,425 --> 00:21:22,992
Hoo, hoo!

434
00:21:23,995 --> 00:21:25,695
What is this?

435
00:21:25,696 --> 00:21:27,396
Did I volunteer for some
science experiment or something?

436
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:29,665
Am I sitting in a lab somewhere

437
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,933
pumped full of cocaine and
daffodil juice or something.

438
00:21:32,637 --> 00:21:33,469
Well, that I can't tell you.

439
00:21:33,471 --> 00:21:35,337
So you don't know why?

440
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:37,039
How much do you remember?

441
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,409
I remember driving this
route with you before.

442
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:42,011
I can't...

443
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:47,316
It's like trying to
remember a dream.

444
00:21:49,086 --> 00:21:50,986
How are you so calm about this?

445
00:21:50,988 --> 00:21:53,088
I've had a lot of
time to get used to it.

446
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,007
Time?

447
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:56,925
Time, how many times have
we taken this drive before?

448
00:21:56,928 --> 00:21:58,160
Five?

449
00:21:58,162 --> 00:21:59,161
10?

450
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:00,963
A hundred.

451
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:02,498
Maybe more.

452
00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:04,339
It was so many drives
together that we started.

453
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:06,335
And you never remember,

454
00:22:07,171 --> 00:22:08,704
and I never forget.

455
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:10,439
So I've driven you down
this same stretch of road

456
00:22:10,441 --> 00:22:14,109
over and over again
for a hundred times?

457
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:18,547
Hoo hoo hoo hoo
hoo hoo, the fuck.

458
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:20,983
Are you happy about this?

459
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:23,219
Yeah.

460
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,454
I've given up hope you'll
ever remember anything.

461
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:27,022
Who are you?

462
00:22:27,024 --> 00:22:28,123
I'm just your fare.

463
00:22:29,093 --> 00:22:30,326
I just got in your cab one day.

464
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:32,494
This is my fare, okay.

465
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:35,064
Well, that clears everything up.

466
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,233
Harris, come in.

467
00:22:38,235 --> 00:22:39,535
Go for Harris.

468
00:22:39,537 --> 00:22:41,470
Weather's
gettin' worse out there.

469
00:22:41,472 --> 00:22:43,172
I see it.

470
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:44,306
Drop off your fare,

471
00:22:44,308 --> 00:22:46,508
come back into the city limits.

472
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,743
Roger that.

473
00:22:50,614 --> 00:22:52,581
No, no no no no no no.

474
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:53,583
No.

475
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:55,618
Penny.

476
00:22:57,288 --> 00:22:58,288
No!

477
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:06,296
Damn it!

478
00:23:10,634 --> 00:23:11,634
Ah!

479
00:23:20,745 --> 00:23:22,444
Hoo!

480
00:23:22,446 --> 00:23:23,245
Extraterrestrials
came to our planet

481
00:23:23,247 --> 00:23:24,380
thousands of years ago.

482
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:26,648
What people don't realize

483
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,283
is that they irrevocably
altered our reality.

484
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:30,052
What was will never be.

485
00:23:30,054 --> 00:23:31,153
Unbelievable.

486
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:35,942
Unbelievable.

487
00:23:35,943 --> 00:23:38,263
Shifted the
very fabric of space and time.

488
00:23:39,196 --> 00:23:40,716
Time
traveling aliens.

489
00:23:41,132 --> 00:23:43,365
Are they aliens, Bob?

490
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:45,501
Or are they us?

491
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:47,169
Dispatch to Harris.

492
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:50,472
Yeah, ETA on the
pick up, almost there,

493
00:23:50,474 --> 00:23:51,473
will keep you posted.

494
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:52,475
Over and out.

495
00:23:56,647 --> 00:23:58,113
Mmm.

496
00:23:58,115 --> 00:23:59,115
Fuck.

497
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:20,202
Get in, the heat
smells like burning.

498
00:24:21,705 --> 00:24:24,540
You know what, hey, why don't
you sit up front this time?

499
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:25,641
Is that allowed?

500
00:24:25,643 --> 00:24:27,193
Who's gonna tell on us?

501
00:24:27,194 --> 00:24:28,744
We're apparently stuck in a
time loop for all eternity.

502
00:24:28,746 --> 00:24:30,079
Let's change it up.

503
00:24:38,222 --> 00:24:39,321
Well.

504
00:24:40,257 --> 00:24:41,090
Hi.

505
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:42,424
wow.

506
00:24:42,426 --> 00:24:44,293
This is really real.

507
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:45,327
I'm afraid so.

508
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:48,163
Shall we drive?

509
00:24:48,165 --> 00:24:49,398
We have to go in a
different direction.

510
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,699
Don't ask to go
to Elm and River,

511
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:51,567
pick somewhere else.

512
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:52,835
Anywhere.

513
00:24:52,837 --> 00:24:54,770
I already tried that.

514
00:24:54,772 --> 00:24:58,273
Drives 12 through 22,

515
00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:00,843
then again on 49, got
desperate that time.

516
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:02,744
Well, what happened?

517
00:25:02,746 --> 00:25:04,313
Every road is blocked.

518
00:25:04,315 --> 00:25:05,581
Or forced back that direction.

519
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:06,748
It's the only way we can go.

520
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,183
Have we ever gotten
out and walked?

521
00:25:08,185 --> 00:25:09,818
We get caught in
the electric storm

522
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,620
and have to duck
back in the cab.

523
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:13,455
There has to be
something we haven't tried.

524
00:25:13,457 --> 00:25:15,190
Tell you what.

525
00:25:15,192 --> 00:25:17,426
If you come up with something,
you make sure to let me know.

526
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:18,660
I've tried everything
I could think of.

527
00:25:18,662 --> 00:25:22,331
Why don't we just keep
driving to Elm and River

528
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,466
and see where it takes us.

529
00:25:24,468 --> 00:25:26,335
All right.

530
00:25:26,337 --> 00:25:27,703
We got to figure this shit out.

531
00:25:37,581 --> 00:25:39,548
One thing I don't understand.

532
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,250
Just one?

533
00:25:41,252 --> 00:25:42,317
Why can't I remember?

534
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:45,287
I think a better question is

535
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:46,855
why did you start remembering.

536
00:25:48,259 --> 00:25:50,192
There was an accident
and the partition broke.

537
00:25:50,194 --> 00:25:52,194
Oh yeah, I believe I
put my face through it.

538
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:53,362
I touched your hand.

539
00:25:55,199 --> 00:25:56,199
Was that it?

540
00:25:57,368 --> 00:26:00,202
Well, whatever it
was, I'm grateful.

541
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:03,272
I know you're anxious to
get to the bottom of this,

542
00:26:03,274 --> 00:26:05,541
but I am just happy
to have the company.

543
00:26:05,543 --> 00:26:08,243
wow, that burning smell
is way stronger up here.

544
00:26:08,245 --> 00:26:09,711
Shoulda warned ya.

545
00:26:09,713 --> 00:26:10,946
I am so sorry.

546
00:26:10,948 --> 00:26:12,581
I put you through
that so many times.

547
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:13,682
It's okay.

548
00:26:13,684 --> 00:26:14,950
I don't remember.

549
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,220
You were saying something about

550
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:19,588
how grateful you were for me.

551
00:26:20,758 --> 00:26:21,758
I was saying.

552
00:26:23,794 --> 00:26:25,260
I am.

553
00:26:26,864 --> 00:26:28,831
I'm grateful.

554
00:26:28,832 --> 00:26:30,799
Until now I've been very alone.

555
00:26:33,704 --> 00:26:35,304
You're not alone anymore.

556
00:26:37,241 --> 00:26:39,741
So, how do we beat this?

557
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:42,945
I don't know if we can.

558
00:26:42,947 --> 00:26:45,414
You remember every drive, right?

559
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:47,382
What's something we
never tried before?

560
00:26:47,384 --> 00:26:48,617
Harris, we're in a cab.

561
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:50,519
There's a finite amount
of things we can do.

562
00:26:50,521 --> 00:26:52,287
Well, have we ever tried
lighting the cab on fire

563
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:53,989
and running it off the
road at 100 miles per hour?

564
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:54,957
That'd be drive 64.

565
00:26:54,959 --> 00:26:55,791
Really?

566
00:26:55,793 --> 00:26:56,959
No.

567
00:26:56,961 --> 00:26:58,660
Just nothing to light it with.

568
00:26:58,662 --> 00:26:59,861
Well, if this is new for you,

569
00:26:59,863 --> 00:27:01,863
and right now you've
got the stamina for it,

570
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:05,667
but for me it's been
a very long road.

571
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:08,437
Honestly, I'm just
really happy to be able

572
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,538
to have a conversation with you

573
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,240
where we can finally move on

574
00:27:11,242 --> 00:27:13,008
from tell me something
about yourself.

575
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,409
I took a class on Jack Kirby.

576
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:15,877
Now tell me something
about yourself.

577
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:17,512
I told you about
my Jack Kirby class?

578
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:18,480
Yeah, you mentioned it.

579
00:27:18,482 --> 00:27:20,015
I am so sorry.

580
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:21,017
Don't be.

581
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:23,485
I actually know a lot about you.

582
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:25,520
Let's see.

583
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:27,956
I know where you were born.

584
00:27:27,958 --> 00:27:30,425
I know the make and model of
every car you've ever driven.

585
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:33,362
I know your high school
mascot, go bulldogs.

586
00:27:33,364 --> 00:27:38,033
I know your favorite album,
first celebrity crush.

587
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:41,003
Oh, I even know your
favorite breakfast cereal.

588
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,905
It's Cocoa Puffs.

589
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:48,444
I'm...

590
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:49,725
I'm sorry, but I don't know you.

591
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:52,881
I'm partial to Fruit Loops.

592
00:27:52,883 --> 00:27:53,882
Eh.

593
00:27:56,387 --> 00:27:59,488
Look, I can't imagine
what this is like for you,

594
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,691
but if it helps, I
consider us friends.

595
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:05,595
Friends?

596
00:28:08,866 --> 00:28:09,866
Okay.

597
00:28:11,068 --> 00:28:13,335
I guess I got some
catchin' up to do.

598
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:16,538
Yeah, you do.

599
00:28:20,044 --> 00:28:21,376
Do you think has
something to do with it,

600
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:22,378
this loop we're in?

601
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:25,047
I don't know.

602
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:32,654
I wonder what would happen
if I didn't reset the meter.

603
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:33,656
What do you mean?

604
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:37,392
Nothin', never mind.

605
00:28:37,394 --> 00:28:39,394
We'll think of
something, I'm sure.

606
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:41,751
Dispatch to Harris.

607
00:28:42,333 --> 00:28:44,399
Not sure why I'm bothering.

608
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:45,934
Go for Harris.

609
00:28:45,936 --> 00:28:47,369
Some
bad weather reports.

610
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:50,005
In my area, yeah,
I see the storm.

611
00:28:50,007 --> 00:28:51,807
Bring the cab back
in after my drop off?

612
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:53,108
That's a roger.

613
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,077
Will do, my liege.

614
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,079
Harris out.

615
00:28:58,115 --> 00:29:00,849
So, before you disappear.

616
00:29:01,885 --> 00:29:02,885
Or not.

617
00:29:10,394 --> 00:29:12,361
What happens to you
when you disappear?

618
00:29:12,363 --> 00:29:13,595
Does it hurt?

619
00:29:13,597 --> 00:29:14,597
No.

620
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,466
It's kind of like
falling asleep,

621
00:29:18,469 --> 00:29:20,753
and then the next time I wake up

622
00:29:20,754 --> 00:29:23,038
I'm out on the road in
the cold waiting for you.

623
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:25,607
What about you?

624
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:28,043
As soon as I reset this meter
it's literally like I blink

625
00:29:28,045 --> 00:29:29,678
and I'm back on the road
at the very beginning

626
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,581
listening to the worst crap
imaginable on the radio.

627
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,083
There we go.

628
00:29:34,084 --> 00:29:35,584
The
grandmother is an alien.

629
00:29:35,586 --> 00:29:37,853
We are the aliens.

630
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:39,521
I'm an alien.

631
00:29:39,523 --> 00:29:41,390
Do you remember the first time?

632
00:29:41,392 --> 00:29:43,409
Yeah.

633
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,427
Did something happen to
us that caused all this?

634
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:46,428
Nothing happened.

635
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,431
We drove into some bad weather.

636
00:29:51,802 --> 00:29:52,802
That was it.

637
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,448
Have you ever tried
holding onto anything?

638
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,649
Like what?

639
00:30:07,651 --> 00:30:09,050
Like your hand?

640
00:30:09,052 --> 00:30:11,052
You trying to get me
to hold your hand?

641
00:30:12,055 --> 00:30:13,922
I never said
anything about a hand.

642
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,527
See now you're not even
gonna get your hand held.

643
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:20,495
For research purposes only.

644
00:30:22,466 --> 00:30:23,466
Oh.

645
00:30:27,704 --> 00:30:28,704
wow.

646
00:30:29,673 --> 00:30:31,640
You have very big hands.

647
00:30:31,642 --> 00:30:32,841
Mmm!

648
00:30:34,478 --> 00:30:35,478
All right.

649
00:31:52,723 --> 00:31:53,723
Hello.

650
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,193
Is someone out there?

651
00:32:02,165 --> 00:32:03,698
Is anyone out there?

652
00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:10,572
I'm out here.

653
00:32:10,574 --> 00:32:12,207
What the hell's wrong with you?

654
00:32:14,044 --> 00:32:15,143
Sorry.

655
00:32:15,145 --> 00:32:17,579
Jerk off.

656
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:38,601
Miss me?

657
00:32:58,755 --> 00:33:00,755
Hey, are you
actually a stripper.

658
00:33:00,757 --> 00:33:03,858
Oh God, that you remembered?

659
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,362
No, I made that up.

660
00:33:07,364 --> 00:33:08,997
By then I was just
making stuff up

661
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,899
to get a rise out of you.

662
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:14,703
I was also an FBI agent
once and I worked for NASA.

663
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:16,221
How did I react to that?

664
00:33:16,222 --> 00:33:17,738
Not nearly as
fascinated as you were

665
00:33:17,741 --> 00:33:19,274
about the stripper one.

666
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:20,808
Well, what do you actually do?

667
00:33:20,811 --> 00:33:23,678
Believe it or not,
I'm in horticulture.

668
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,613
Huh.

669
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:25,814
It's plants and flowers.

670
00:33:25,816 --> 00:33:27,048
I run a plant nursery.

671
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:31,086
Ah, horticulture huh.

672
00:33:31,088 --> 00:33:32,287
Yeah.

673
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:34,055
See, when you tell
people I'm in plants,

674
00:33:34,057 --> 00:33:35,924
that's usually a
conversation ender.

675
00:33:36,827 --> 00:33:38,860
I like fertilization.

676
00:33:40,397 --> 00:33:41,997
Is that a plant joke?

677
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:43,398
I like plants.

678
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,834
You've never had anything
to say about plants.

679
00:33:45,836 --> 00:33:46,901
Trust me.

680
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:50,338
Okay, let's play
marry fuck kill.

681
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:52,374
Marry, fuck, kill.

682
00:33:52,376 --> 00:33:53,808
'Kay.

683
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:58,279
Selena Gomez, Ariana
Grande, Miley Cyrus.

684
00:33:58,715 --> 00:34:00,081
Go.

685
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,282
Hey.

686
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:03,218
How come you don't like
to be called Harry?

687
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,686
I like to think I'm
harry enough as it is.

688
00:34:04,688 --> 00:34:07,222
I don't need it pointed
out to me constantly.

689
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:08,757
Do I have to?

690
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:10,191
Yeah, that's the game.

691
00:34:10,193 --> 00:34:11,326
What about you?

692
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,661
Penny short for
anything like Penelope?

693
00:34:12,663 --> 00:34:13,828
No.

694
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,829
It's just Penny.

695
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:16,731
You know, like the coin.

696
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:17,365
Like the coin.

697
00:34:17,367 --> 00:34:18,299
Yeah, like the coin.

698
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:19,801
'Cause she did Wrecking Ball,

699
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:22,737
and I would marry Selena Gomez

700
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,105
'cause she's such a good girl.

701
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:26,107
Is she?

702
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:27,109
Okay.

703
00:34:28,412 --> 00:34:29,844
You're trapped on
a desert island.

704
00:34:29,846 --> 00:34:32,280
Or how about just
in a car forever.

705
00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:34,282
Or that.

706
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:36,283
And let's say you can be trapped
with anybody dead or alive,

707
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:37,686
who would you wanna
be trapped with?

708
00:34:37,688 --> 00:34:39,721
Tread lightly, my
feelings are fragile.

709
00:34:39,723 --> 00:34:40,989
Marry, fuck, kill.

710
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:42,891
Okay.

711
00:34:42,893 --> 00:34:44,893
Penn Jillette,
Teller, Criss Angel.

712
00:34:46,296 --> 00:34:47,296
Pet what?

713
00:34:48,265 --> 00:34:49,265
Let's see.

714
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:53,101
MacGyver probably.

715
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:55,103
I mean, I figure he'd,
you know, build something

716
00:34:55,105 --> 00:34:57,105
to get me off the island.

717
00:34:57,107 --> 00:34:58,073
MacGyver.

718
00:34:58,075 --> 00:34:59,007
Yeah.

719
00:34:59,009 --> 00:35:00,909
Penn Jillette and Teller.

720
00:35:00,911 --> 00:35:03,712
I don't know the
difference between the two.

721
00:35:03,714 --> 00:35:04,746
This is a hard choice.

722
00:35:04,748 --> 00:35:06,314
This is the game though.

723
00:35:06,316 --> 00:35:08,116
Brad Pitt.

724
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:09,951
Ah, True Romance.

725
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:11,853
It's like the first
thing he was ever in,

726
00:35:11,855 --> 00:35:12,821
he had a tiny part.

727
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:13,455
Anyway, True Romance.

728
00:35:13,457 --> 00:35:14,889
Christian Slater.

729
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:16,358
Isn't it like he always has like

730
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:17,826
a paperclip and a jar of
peanut butter or something.

731
00:35:17,828 --> 00:35:18,927
He builds a bomb out of it.

732
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:20,161
Fair enough, it was your choice.

733
00:35:20,163 --> 00:35:21,796
You wanted to get
off the island.

734
00:35:21,798 --> 00:35:23,231
I was thinking
about maybe basking

735
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:25,066
in the glow of the island.

736
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:26,267
Well, no.

737
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:27,869
Just making the
best of my situation.

738
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:29,354
- But that's cool, that's cool.
- Well, in that case.

739
00:35:29,355 --> 00:35:30,838
In that case if we
were to make the best

740
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:32,591
of our situation,

741
00:35:32,592 --> 00:35:34,552
I would much rather be in
a cab than on an island,

742
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:38,179
and there's no one I'd rather
be trapped with than you.

743
00:35:38,181 --> 00:35:39,013
Thank you.

744
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:39,848
Mm-hmm.

745
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,915
Yeah, what about you?

746
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,028
MacGyver?

747
00:35:42,029 --> 00:35:43,140
You
know what you are?

748
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,252
You are one of those bullshit

749
00:35:44,254 --> 00:35:45,920
sensationalist
pseudo scientists.

750
00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:47,856
I didn't think he would
say bullshit on the radio.

751
00:35:47,858 --> 00:35:49,290
Without having to take

752
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:50,759
any responsibility for anyone.

753
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:54,429
I think Bella's
marriage material,

754
00:35:54,431 --> 00:35:55,897
but Jasmine's sexy.

755
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:57,899
Jasmine's very sexy.

756
00:35:57,901 --> 00:36:01,803
Can I have like a
Stepford wife of sorts,

757
00:36:01,805 --> 00:36:03,071
like a robot?

758
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:04,939
Why would your mind go there?

759
00:36:04,941 --> 00:36:06,474
You just hate people, don't you?

760
00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:07,809
Yeah, yeah.

761
00:36:09,846 --> 00:36:10,812
Yeah.

762
00:36:10,814 --> 00:36:11,446
All right.

763
00:36:11,448 --> 00:36:12,514
Well, he's already died.

764
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:14,316
I don't even  the other.

765
00:36:14,317 --> 00:36:16,117
Convincing
some old lady in Iowa

766
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:18,953
that time traveling
aliens are the reason

767
00:36:18,955 --> 00:36:20,021
her grandkids don't visit.

768
00:36:20,023 --> 00:36:21,256
Shame on you.

769
00:36:21,258 --> 00:36:22,056
But
Bob, if you listen

770
00:36:22,058 --> 00:36:23,291
to what I'm saying...

771
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:24,526
What
exactly are you saying?

772
00:36:24,528 --> 00:36:26,361
Actually, I think
I finally figured out

773
00:36:26,363 --> 00:36:28,230
what they're saying.

774
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:30,098
So, these time traveling
us aliens from the future

775
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:34,169
travel back in time and
created us in their/our image.

776
00:36:34,171 --> 00:36:36,437
But in doing so
altered our appearance

777
00:36:36,439 --> 00:36:38,039
so that we look more like them.

778
00:36:39,009 --> 00:36:40,008
Which is us.

779
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:45,313
Yeah, but how did we turn
into them in the first place?

780
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:48,283
For them to go back
in time and create us.

781
00:36:48,285 --> 00:36:49,918
See, that would
have to happen first

782
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,853
for us to look like them,

783
00:36:51,855 --> 00:36:53,855
if they're us.

784
00:36:54,991 --> 00:36:55,991
Which is us.

785
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,060
Wait.

786
00:36:59,496 --> 00:37:01,863
Damn it, I had this.

787
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:03,097
No, you didn't.

788
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:04,566
Get
out of my office.

789
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:05,500
Could I
just take the water with me.

790
00:37:05,502 --> 00:37:07,936
But why not me on the island?

791
00:37:07,938 --> 00:37:09,404
Like you, is it...

792
00:37:09,406 --> 00:37:10,839
'Cause can you build a raft

793
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:12,240
out of coconuts
and dental floss?

794
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:13,875
Why do you wanna
get off the island?

795
00:37:13,877 --> 00:37:15,577
Why can't we enjoy the island?

796
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:17,912
Why can't we be islanders.

797
00:37:17,914 --> 00:37:19,147
It's our island.

798
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:19,981
No, that's cool.

799
00:37:19,983 --> 00:37:21,015
It's cool, it's cool.

800
00:37:21,017 --> 00:37:21,950
I'll just drop you...

801
00:37:21,952 --> 00:37:23,602
Oh, this looks like a good spot,

802
00:37:23,603 --> 00:37:25,323
it's the middle of
nowhere, perfect for you.

803
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:29,257
Got
through government grants.

804
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:32,126
We came to the conclusion that

805
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:34,629
these so-called
extraterrestrials

806
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:37,131
came to our home thousands
of years ago.

807
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,533
What people don't realize

808
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:41,002
is that they irrevocably
altered our reality.

809
00:37:49,446 --> 00:37:50,912
What happens to you?

810
00:37:50,914 --> 00:37:52,013
No!

811
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,083
Penny!

812
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:56,918
I'm doing it.

813
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,152
We'll think of somethin'.

814
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:00,289
Miss me?

815
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:10,099
It gets easier.

816
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,636
Come on, talk to me.

817
00:38:15,472 --> 00:38:16,472
It's nothin'.

818
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:21,075
What's at Elm and
River Drive anyway?

819
00:38:21,077 --> 00:38:24,112
Honestly, I don't even remember.

820
00:38:25,115 --> 00:38:26,347
Hey, why a cab?

821
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:28,016
You never told me.

822
00:38:28,018 --> 00:38:29,468
Why do you drive a cab?

823
00:38:29,469 --> 00:38:30,919
Why does it matter
why I drive a cab?

824
00:38:30,921 --> 00:38:33,321
Or where I went to high
school or my favorite Beatle.

825
00:38:33,323 --> 00:38:35,056
None of it matters,
nothing matters here.

826
00:38:35,058 --> 00:38:36,058
We're just...

827
00:38:40,196 --> 00:38:41,196
Sorry.

828
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:47,135
My Pops drove one.

829
00:38:47,137 --> 00:38:49,437
32 years, right up until
he croaked at the wheel.

830
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,372
Did he like it?

831
00:38:51,374 --> 00:38:53,308
No, absolutely hated it,

832
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,443
complained about a
sore ass all the time.

833
00:38:56,546 --> 00:38:58,012
But that was the
thing about him,

834
00:38:58,014 --> 00:39:00,214
he just never had it in
him to be anything else.

835
00:39:00,984 --> 00:39:02,016
Had it in him?

836
00:39:02,018 --> 00:39:02,984
How?

837
00:39:02,986 --> 00:39:04,986
He was a simple guy.

838
00:39:04,988 --> 00:39:08,089
Got up, did his job, came home.

839
00:39:08,091 --> 00:39:09,590
Before he knew it he was old,

840
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:11,492
his life hadn't
amounted to anything.

841
00:39:11,494 --> 00:39:14,095
You say that like
you despise him for it.

842
00:39:14,097 --> 00:39:15,296
No, I just...

843
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:19,634
I didn't wanna be
the same as him.

844
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:26,407
Joke's on me I guess.

845
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,377
Think you're up for
rubbin' my ass a bit.

846
00:39:32,148 --> 00:39:33,715
I'm just tired of drivin'.

847
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:39,253
You feel trapped.

848
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:45,093
I know all about what
it's like to feel trapped.

849
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:52,200
I'm married back in the world.

850
00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:56,037
But it's...

851
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:58,172
It's not what a
marriage should be.

852
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:00,074
It's not even close.

853
00:40:01,644 --> 00:40:06,714
My husband, he's brilliant,
but he's cold and he's cruel.

854
00:40:09,252 --> 00:40:11,686
And his work always comes
first, which is fine,

855
00:40:11,688 --> 00:40:13,654
what he does is important,

856
00:40:13,656 --> 00:40:18,026
and, honestly, I'm
relieved not to have to

857
00:40:18,028 --> 00:40:20,095
spend any time with him

858
00:40:20,096 --> 00:40:22,163
outside of social
functions and appearances.

859
00:40:24,034 --> 00:40:28,202
But living like that,
it makes you alone.

860
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:30,238
Even when you're around people.

861
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,239
See, you don't know
what that's like,

862
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:32,206
you don't know what it's like

863
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:33,508
to live life out in the cold.

864
00:40:35,145 --> 00:40:37,111
Then why not divorce him?

865
00:40:37,113 --> 00:40:39,580
Because our families
are influential

866
00:40:39,582 --> 00:40:42,417
and our marriage is an
alliance between them.

867
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:44,652
It's not something I can
just file some papers

868
00:40:44,654 --> 00:40:46,354
and walk away from.

869
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:50,158
So you see, you don't
have to be in a time loop

870
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,459
to be trapped.

871
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:55,096
I'm sorry.

872
00:40:55,098 --> 00:40:56,197
I'm not.

873
00:40:58,068 --> 00:40:59,167
Not here.

874
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:00,201
Here I'm not alone.

875
00:41:02,405 --> 00:41:04,605
You can judge me if you want.

876
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:06,641
As a matter of fact,
you probably should.

877
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:09,844
But part of me, big part of me

878
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:13,247
is genuinely happy
to be here with you.

879
00:41:18,154 --> 00:41:19,520
So what about you?

880
00:41:19,522 --> 00:41:21,355
Is there anybody special?

881
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:23,758
Well, in high school
my girlfriend dumped me

882
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,094
in front of the band and the
dick playing the trombone

883
00:41:26,096 --> 00:41:27,195
went wah-wah.

884
00:41:27,197 --> 00:41:30,698
Everybody laughed at
me and I wanted to die.

885
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,301
That was my last
serious relationship.

886
00:41:33,303 --> 00:41:35,269
That can't possibly be it.

887
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:36,304
No.

888
00:41:36,306 --> 00:41:37,705
That's not it at all.

889
00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:44,312
Hey, I get it, it's okay.

890
00:41:44,314 --> 00:41:46,314
We don't have to
talk about that.

891
00:41:46,316 --> 00:41:49,784
There's plenty of other
subjects to discuss.

892
00:41:49,786 --> 00:41:51,385
Hey, did you see
that game last night?

893
00:41:51,387 --> 00:41:53,321
All right, smart ass.

894
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:56,257
There was someone.

895
00:41:57,227 --> 00:41:58,593
How'd you guys meet?

896
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:01,362
She got into my cab one day.

897
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:02,497
Was she riveting?

898
00:42:03,366 --> 00:42:05,133
Very.

899
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:09,170
Yeah, but was she asked you
to turn the heat on riveting?

900
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:10,805
No, not that riveting.

901
00:42:10,807 --> 00:42:12,273
Plus we met in the summer time,

902
00:42:12,275 --> 00:42:15,209
so ironically the first
thing she asked me for

903
00:42:15,211 --> 00:42:17,278
was to turn on the
air conditioning.

904
00:42:20,216 --> 00:42:22,250
We didn't end well.

905
00:42:22,252 --> 00:42:23,317
I thought we were...

906
00:42:24,521 --> 00:42:27,188
I was deluding myself.

907
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,322
How so?

908
00:42:28,324 --> 00:42:29,857
She ran off on me one day.

909
00:42:29,859 --> 00:42:31,659
Did she tell you why?

910
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,460
Probably didn't wanna be
with a lowly cab driver.

911
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:35,363
I'm sure
it's not like that.

912
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:37,331
Well, whatever it was,

913
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:39,534
I guess whatever we
had wasn't enough.

914
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,636
Did you ever see her again?

915
00:42:41,638 --> 00:42:42,638
No.

916
00:42:43,806 --> 00:42:45,206
Well, suppose you
ran into her again.

917
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,274
What would you say?

918
00:42:46,276 --> 00:42:47,308
Come on.

919
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,342
What would you say?

920
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:56,884
I'm sorry I didn't
know how to fix it.

921
00:42:59,222 --> 00:43:00,788
What makes you
think it's your fault?

922
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,356
Had to be someone's fault.

923
00:43:04,227 --> 00:43:05,293
No, it doesn't.

924
00:43:05,295 --> 00:43:10,264
And for what it's worth,
I think it's quite noble

925
00:43:10,266 --> 00:43:13,401
to transport people
to their destinations.

926
00:43:13,403 --> 00:43:15,836
There's nothing lowly
about being a cab driver.

927
00:43:16,973 --> 00:43:18,673
We all have to get
where we're going.

928
00:43:18,675 --> 00:43:20,641
You say that except I
can't for the life of me

929
00:43:20,643 --> 00:43:23,277
get you to Elm and
goddamn River Drive.

930
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:24,645
Some cabby I am.

931
00:44:10,526 --> 00:44:12,360
I'll find you, Penny.

932
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:16,791
What am I doing?

933
00:45:16,793 --> 00:45:18,959
What the hell am I doing?

934
00:45:38,448 --> 00:45:39,547
Come on.

935
00:45:41,984 --> 00:45:43,384
Come on!

936
00:45:46,689 --> 00:45:47,689
Come on!

937
00:45:53,496 --> 00:45:54,895
Harris.

938
00:46:06,509 --> 00:46:07,875
Harris, come back.

939
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,123
Harris to Dispatch.

940
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:33,567
Harris to Dispatch,
please come in.

941
00:46:58,127 --> 00:46:59,860
Turn back.

942
00:47:01,464 --> 00:47:02,496
What?

943
00:47:02,498 --> 00:47:04,031
Turn back.

944
00:47:08,704 --> 00:47:09,704
Turn back!

945
00:47:11,441 --> 00:47:12,441
Turn back!

946
00:47:51,681 --> 00:47:53,647
Hey, are you okay?

947
00:47:56,619 --> 00:47:57,852
Just glad to see you.

948
00:47:59,889 --> 00:48:01,655
Something happened.

949
00:48:01,657 --> 00:48:02,857
What happened?

950
00:48:02,859 --> 00:48:03,859
Nothin'.

951
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:12,933
You're okay.

952
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:15,736
Why wouldn't I be?

953
00:48:18,107 --> 00:48:19,107
I can't lose you.

954
00:48:20,910 --> 00:48:21,842
What do you mean?

955
00:48:21,844 --> 00:48:23,978
We're stuck together, remember?

956
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:31,519
You're not gonna lose me.

957
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:02,816
My seat belt's stuck.

958
00:49:07,757 --> 00:49:10,324
wow, that's really impressive.

959
00:49:12,695 --> 00:49:14,228
That was impressive.

960
00:50:03,713 --> 00:50:06,046
So what
happened after we left

961
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:07,214
each other last time?

962
00:50:07,216 --> 00:50:09,249
Doesn't
matter, you were right.

963
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:11,251
Well, I'm used to that.

964
00:50:11,253 --> 00:50:14,021
But pray tell in what
context are you referring?

965
00:50:14,023 --> 00:50:16,390
At first all I
wanted was to get out of this.

966
00:50:16,392 --> 00:50:17,291
Go on.

967
00:50:17,293 --> 00:50:22,763
What if we were meant to
be here with each other?

968
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:24,865
What if this is a gift?

969
00:50:27,837 --> 00:50:29,003
Let's just stay here.

970
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,772
What do you think?

971
00:50:31,774 --> 00:50:34,942
No more loneliness,
no more empty lives,

972
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:37,144
just you and me.

973
00:50:38,347 --> 00:50:39,813
Are you sure?

974
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:41,048
You can live with that?

975
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,783
I think so.

976
00:50:42,785 --> 00:50:44,818
And that'll be enough?

977
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:27,127
Where did you get that scar?

978
00:51:29,999 --> 00:51:30,999
What scar?

979
00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:33,367
The one on your head,

980
00:51:33,369 --> 00:51:35,469
right where it went
through the partition.

981
00:51:41,177 --> 00:51:43,243
If time was resetting,
how did that heal?

982
00:51:46,949 --> 00:51:48,015
You're not resetting.

983
00:51:49,752 --> 00:51:51,251
That must mean neither am I.

984
00:51:51,253 --> 00:51:52,786
What's going on?

985
00:51:52,788 --> 00:51:53,787
That scar looks old.

986
00:51:53,789 --> 00:51:54,421
Where did that time go?

987
00:51:54,423 --> 00:51:55,289
Where was I?

988
00:51:55,291 --> 00:51:56,223
Harris.

989
00:51:56,225 --> 00:51:57,324
No, tell me the truth, Penny!

990
00:51:57,326 --> 00:51:58,358
What is going on?

991
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,293
What don't I know?

992
00:51:59,295 --> 00:52:00,461
Don't ask those questions.

993
00:52:00,463 --> 00:52:02,796
Don't pull on the thread.

994
00:52:02,798 --> 00:52:04,348
What don't I know?

995
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:05,899
Just stay here with me,
just be happy with me.

996
00:52:05,901 --> 00:52:06,934
Just be...

997
00:52:06,936 --> 00:52:08,169
Be here with me.

998
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,490
Are you the one keeping me here?

999
00:52:11,807 --> 00:52:12,906
No.

1000
00:52:17,747 --> 00:52:18,378
It was...

1001
00:52:19,215 --> 00:52:20,047
What?

1002
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:20,881
Who?

1003
00:52:20,883 --> 00:52:21,915
Who is keeping me here?

1004
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,056
Harris.

1005
00:52:29,058 --> 00:52:30,058
Harris!

1006
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:31,859
Don't drink the water.

1007
00:52:56,819 --> 00:52:58,352
Harris, come in.

1008
00:52:59,989 --> 00:53:01,489
Yeah, I'm here.

1009
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:02,990
What's your
ETA on that pick up?

1010
00:53:02,992 --> 00:53:04,358
Any minute, I'll
keep you posted.

1011
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,360
Harris out.

1012
00:53:57,546 --> 00:53:58,879
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1013
00:53:58,881 --> 00:54:01,081
no, no, no, no, no, no.

1014
00:54:19,401 --> 00:54:21,001
Elm and River.

1015
00:54:30,546 --> 00:54:32,512
Elm and River Drive.

1016
00:55:15,524 --> 00:55:17,958
Come back to me.

1017
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:24,131
I'll find you, Penny.

1018
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:26,033
Where is Penny?

1019
00:55:26,035 --> 00:55:27,267
Who's Penny?

1020
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,539
Who is Penny.

1021
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:35,976
There was someone.

1022
00:55:39,315 --> 00:55:40,698
How did you guys meet?

1023
00:55:40,699 --> 00:55:42,082
She got
into my cab one day.

1024
00:55:42,084 --> 00:55:43,650
Was she riveting?

1025
00:55:43,652 --> 00:55:44,652
Very.

1026
00:55:47,156 --> 00:55:48,588
We didn't end well.

1027
00:55:57,499 --> 00:55:58,732
Hi.

1028
00:55:58,734 --> 00:55:59,666
Hi.

1029
00:55:59,668 --> 00:56:01,969
You call for a cab, Miss?

1030
00:56:01,971 --> 00:56:03,370
Yeah, I did.

1031
00:56:03,372 --> 00:56:05,405
Do you have air
conditioning in there?

1032
00:56:05,407 --> 00:56:06,573
I do.

1033
00:56:06,575 --> 00:56:08,408
We're fancy, it
works and everything.

1034
00:56:09,278 --> 00:56:10,744
That's awesome, thank you.

1035
00:57:49,378 --> 00:57:54,381
You know, legend has it that
the star Altair is a man,

1036
00:57:55,184 --> 00:57:56,583
and the star Vega is a woman,

1037
00:57:56,585 --> 00:57:59,453
and they loved each
other very much.

1038
00:57:59,455 --> 00:58:02,222
But they weren't
allowed to be together.

1039
00:58:02,224 --> 00:58:04,591
So the milky way was
created as a barrier

1040
00:58:04,593 --> 00:58:05,759
to keep them apart.

1041
00:58:07,296 --> 00:58:10,397
However, every year their
star paths would cross

1042
00:58:10,399 --> 00:58:13,266
and they would get to
spend one moment together

1043
00:58:13,268 --> 00:58:15,235
as they passed each other by.

1044
00:58:15,237 --> 00:58:16,303
Isn't that romantic?

1045
00:58:20,242 --> 00:58:23,510
Are you gagging back
there, how sappy this is?

1046
00:58:23,512 --> 00:58:25,779
No, I'm not gagging, I'm bummed.

1047
00:58:25,781 --> 00:58:26,847
That's really sad.

1048
00:58:29,218 --> 00:58:31,218
Love stories usually are.

1049
01:01:10,345 --> 01:01:11,444
For the ride.

1050
01:01:38,073 --> 01:01:40,674
Harris, come in.

1051
01:01:43,879 --> 01:01:44,879
Harris.

1052
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:53,520
Yeah.

1053
01:01:53,522 --> 01:01:55,422
Did
you make the drop off?

1054
01:01:59,328 --> 01:02:01,094
What's happening to me?

1055
01:02:01,096 --> 01:02:02,529
Nothin'.

1056
01:02:02,531 --> 01:02:03,531
You're doing your job.

1057
01:02:04,366 --> 01:02:06,366
What is my job?

1058
01:02:06,368 --> 01:02:07,801
You work for me.

1059
01:02:10,539 --> 01:02:11,671
What is my job?

1060
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:16,910
Harris,
you are the ferryman.

1061
01:02:26,088 --> 01:02:27,088
Harris?

1062
01:02:30,359 --> 01:02:31,359
No.

1063
01:02:32,828 --> 01:02:33,828
No.

1064
01:02:35,097 --> 01:02:36,629
I have a life.

1065
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:38,465
I'm a cab driver,
I remember that,

1066
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:39,532
I remember...

1067
01:02:45,374 --> 01:02:46,540
Penny.

1068
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:47,707
Well,
you had a life,

1069
01:02:47,709 --> 01:02:50,543
and I'm sure it was a
moderately decent one,

1070
01:02:50,545 --> 01:02:51,978
but it's long over.

1071
01:03:54,843 --> 01:03:55,843
Who are you?

1072
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:57,744
Really?

1073
01:03:57,746 --> 01:03:59,112
It's not obvious?

1074
01:03:59,114 --> 01:04:01,181
We're gonna actually do this.

1075
01:04:02,517 --> 01:04:06,152
Well, throughout the ages
I've been called many things.

1076
01:04:06,154 --> 01:04:07,720
None of them positive.

1077
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:09,556
I don't know why
people hate me so much,

1078
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:11,591
I'm sort of a necessary evil.

1079
01:04:11,593 --> 01:04:13,226
I mean, without
me there would be

1080
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:17,030
no turning of the
tides, no progress.

1081
01:04:17,032 --> 01:04:20,600
Life as they all know
it would cease to exist.

1082
01:04:25,173 --> 01:04:27,540
So you...

1083
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:29,908
I am
the receiver of many.

1084
01:04:31,546 --> 01:04:33,213
Death.

1085
01:04:33,215 --> 01:04:34,614
Personified.

1086
01:04:50,499 --> 01:04:51,499
Penny.

1087
01:04:52,868 --> 01:04:53,700
What about Penny?

1088
01:04:53,702 --> 01:04:54,702
Where is she?

1089
01:04:55,537 --> 01:04:57,036
Penny.

1090
01:04:57,038 --> 01:04:58,605
It's cute, right?

1091
01:04:58,607 --> 01:05:00,673
It's a cute name.

1092
01:05:00,675 --> 01:05:03,576
Your Penny, as she likes
to be called these days,

1093
01:05:03,578 --> 01:05:05,678
is home right now.

1094
01:05:06,681 --> 01:05:08,148
Home.

1095
01:05:08,149 --> 01:05:09,616
You know,
it's not your fault,

1096
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:11,084
what happened with you two.

1097
01:05:11,086 --> 01:05:12,952
I don't actually blame you.

1098
01:05:12,954 --> 01:05:13,954
Persephone.

1099
01:05:14,923 --> 01:05:16,589
Penny and I have
been havin' problems

1100
01:05:16,591 --> 01:05:19,859
for, let's see, ever.

1101
01:05:19,861 --> 01:05:21,594
I tried to make her
happy, I really did,

1102
01:05:21,596 --> 01:05:23,663
but these arranged relationships

1103
01:05:23,665 --> 01:05:26,633
they just never
work out, do they?

1104
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:27,734
So she's...

1105
01:05:27,736 --> 01:05:29,302
Harris.

1106
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:31,638
She's my wife.

1107
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:36,709
My husband, he's
brilliant, but he's cold.

1108
01:05:38,113 --> 01:05:39,145
Time, how many times have
we taken this drive before?

1109
01:05:39,147 --> 01:05:40,213
Five, 10?

1110
01:05:40,215 --> 01:05:41,714
And he's cruel.

1111
01:05:41,716 --> 01:05:43,116
I don't wanna be
the same as him.

1112
01:05:43,118 --> 01:05:44,717
How much do you remember?

1113
01:05:45,787 --> 01:05:47,120
Don't drink the water!

1114
01:05:47,122 --> 01:05:49,088
Harris, remember me this time.

1115
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,191
She hates me.

1116
01:05:52,193 --> 01:05:53,960
I mean hates me,

1117
01:05:55,297 --> 01:05:58,665
and every year she takes
these trips away from here,

1118
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:00,066
away from me.

1119
01:06:00,068 --> 01:06:01,634
Up above.

1120
01:06:01,636 --> 01:06:03,036
She just can't wait, you know.

1121
01:06:03,038 --> 01:06:06,072
She just can't wait to get away.

1122
01:06:06,074 --> 01:06:08,708
And on one of those little trips

1123
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:10,810
she met you.

1124
01:06:12,614 --> 01:06:14,914
Really did a number
on you, didn't she?

1125
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:16,149
She...

1126
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:18,435
I'd like
to point out right now

1127
01:06:18,436 --> 01:06:20,720
that I'm not the bad guy
here, that I'm the victim.

1128
01:06:20,722 --> 01:06:23,289
You guys were the ones
who ran around on me.

1129
01:06:23,291 --> 01:06:27,727
I was forgiving, I was
lenient, I was merciful.

1130
01:06:27,729 --> 01:06:30,296
Yeah, so I sentenced
you to an eternity

1131
01:06:30,298 --> 01:06:32,765
of being my ferryman,

1132
01:06:32,767 --> 01:06:35,335
but I took away your memory
of that little trump,

1133
01:06:35,337 --> 01:06:36,836
and do I get to forget?

1134
01:06:36,838 --> 01:06:38,338
No.

1135
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:41,941
I have to live with what
you guys did, so to speak.

1136
01:06:41,943 --> 01:06:45,178
Oh, and by the way, she's
still messing with you.

1137
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:47,780
She just had to tell
you about the water.

1138
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:50,650
You wanna know something?

1139
01:06:50,652 --> 01:06:52,919
She's the one who put it there.

1140
01:06:54,656 --> 01:06:58,791
So every year she takes
a trip away from here,

1141
01:06:59,761 --> 01:07:01,794
and every year...

1142
01:07:01,796 --> 01:07:04,697
You drive her back.

1143
01:07:04,699 --> 01:07:06,699
There are many ways
for her to leave here,

1144
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:10,637
but there is only
ever one way back.

1145
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:12,740
The ferryman.

1146
01:07:15,343 --> 01:07:16,275
You
know, just because

1147
01:07:16,277 --> 01:07:17,810
you're aware of yourself now

1148
01:07:17,812 --> 01:07:20,813
doesn't mean you
get to stop working.

1149
01:07:20,815 --> 01:07:21,781
Moonlight's burning, Harris.

1150
01:07:21,783 --> 01:07:24,117
Fares are piling up.

1151
01:07:24,119 --> 01:07:25,818
We have a job to do,

1152
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:29,222
and we pride ourselves
on our service.

1153
01:07:29,224 --> 01:07:31,124
So reset your meter.

1154
01:07:31,126 --> 01:07:32,358
Dispatch out.

1155
01:09:52,934 --> 01:09:54,100
You're such a jerk!

1156
01:09:54,102 --> 01:09:55,468
- It wasn't even me.
- I hate you!

1157
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:56,936
It wasn't me.

1158
01:09:56,938 --> 01:09:58,421
- Yeah, it wasn't you.
- I wasn't even there.

1159
01:09:58,422 --> 01:09:59,905
It wasn't you, like,
when your Mom came home.

1160
01:09:59,908 --> 01:10:02,208
And just about then I
started to expand my thinking.

1161
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:05,378
Trying new places, high
end groceries for example.

1162
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:09,949
What?

1163
01:10:09,951 --> 01:10:10,951
Ah.

1164
01:10:12,453 --> 01:10:15,555
Know where we can stop
for a cheeseburger?

1165
01:10:15,557 --> 01:10:18,124
I mean you can really clean
up outside a place like that.

1166
01:10:18,126 --> 01:10:19,592
Look what you did to my shoe!

1167
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:21,127
- You broke my shoe.
- You did that yourself.

1168
01:10:21,129 --> 01:10:23,462
These are the most
expensive shoes I have.

1169
01:10:25,867 --> 01:10:28,901
I, I don't, I don't...

1170
01:10:28,903 --> 01:10:30,570
Hey.

1171
01:10:30,572 --> 01:10:31,604
Cheeseburger.

1172
01:10:34,008 --> 01:10:35,241
Spring break gone bad?

1173
01:10:36,311 --> 01:10:37,610
Dude.

1174
01:10:37,612 --> 01:10:40,012
Say no more, young
squire, say no more.

1175
01:10:40,014 --> 01:10:42,281
I, I, I, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1176
01:10:42,283 --> 01:10:46,919
Stay in the cab, you don't
wanna jump out, die twice.

1177
01:10:46,921 --> 01:10:49,021
Actually, tell me what happened.

1178
01:10:49,023 --> 01:10:51,624
So I got locked in the
bathroom for 45 minutes.

1179
01:10:51,626 --> 01:10:53,593
People think the
secret to panhandling

1180
01:10:53,595 --> 01:10:55,027
is having the right sign.

1181
01:10:55,029 --> 01:10:57,230
That's not the secret at all.

1182
01:10:57,232 --> 01:10:58,631
- You tried to get me...
- Oh my God.

1183
01:10:58,633 --> 01:11:00,066
- You're so annoying.
- This guy's gonna give you...

1184
01:11:00,068 --> 01:11:01,367
A lot of
money, but he's not.

1185
01:11:06,474 --> 01:11:07,473
Elm and River.

1186
01:11:10,144 --> 01:11:11,244
Elm and River.

1187
01:11:11,246 --> 01:11:12,478
Elm and...

1188
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,880
Elm and River.

1189
01:11:13,882 --> 01:11:15,414
We actually don't
eat down here at all.

1190
01:11:17,285 --> 01:11:18,918
I feel like I should warn you.

1191
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:22,922
So the secret is not
to wear shoes, man.

1192
01:11:22,924 --> 01:11:23,556
Oh.

1193
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:37,170
Oh.

1194
01:11:43,978 --> 01:11:45,945
Went out with a bang, huh?

1195
01:11:49,584 --> 01:11:52,285
This isn't one of those
like gas, grass, or ass

1196
01:11:52,287 --> 01:11:53,519
kind of cabs, is it?

1197
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:54,453
I...

1198
01:11:54,455 --> 01:11:55,735
Seemed to have left my wallet.

1199
01:11:59,627 --> 01:12:00,693
You know, we got radio.

1200
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:02,995
I mean it's like XM.

1201
01:12:02,997 --> 01:12:05,498
Are you a vaper or a bonger?

1202
01:12:06,601 --> 01:12:08,134
I'm a chonger.

1203
01:12:08,136 --> 01:12:10,202
That's a cheeseburger bonger.

1204
01:12:10,204 --> 01:12:11,037
Yeah, I'm here.

1205
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:12,071
wow.

1206
01:12:12,073 --> 01:12:12,705
Yeah.

1207
01:12:12,707 --> 01:12:14,140
Well welcome.

1208
01:12:14,142 --> 01:12:16,175
You know, if I could, if
could, if I could just

1209
01:12:16,177 --> 01:12:18,077
for a minute.

1210
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:21,447
It's some compelling stuff,
like time traveling aliens

1211
01:12:21,449 --> 01:12:25,184
and I've listened to it
like a hundred times.

1212
01:12:29,257 --> 01:12:31,057
Elm and river!

1213
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:31,991
Yeah!

1214
01:12:34,128 --> 01:12:35,361
Got my money on her.

1215
01:12:35,363 --> 01:12:38,698
♪ Hello my ragtime gal ♪

1216
01:12:41,569 --> 01:12:43,669
Where the hell is this?

1217
01:13:30,318 --> 01:13:32,451
Please tell me you
have heat in there.

1218
01:13:32,453 --> 01:13:33,786
It smells like burning.

1219
01:13:35,289 --> 01:13:36,289
Always does.

1220
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:50,269
I'm sorry.

1221
01:13:50,271 --> 01:13:51,804
Was this presumptuous of me?

1222
01:13:51,806 --> 01:13:52,806
Not at all.

1223
01:13:55,376 --> 01:13:57,243
It's been a long year.

1224
01:14:23,171 --> 01:14:24,637
Why does that happen every
time you get in my cab?

1225
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:27,173
What's that about?

1226
01:14:27,175 --> 01:14:30,142
That's just my husband
getting ready for a fight,

1227
01:14:30,745 --> 01:14:31,745
which I will win.

1228
01:14:32,647 --> 01:14:33,647
Ah.

1229
01:14:37,251 --> 01:14:38,284
I looked for you,

1230
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,153
then next year when I went back

1231
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,457
I found your cab.

1232
01:14:44,459 --> 01:14:45,791
Did you now?

1233
01:14:45,793 --> 01:14:46,859
I had it restored.

1234
01:14:46,861 --> 01:14:50,096
I even drove it around
a couple of times.

1235
01:14:50,098 --> 01:14:52,198
Oh, and
how'd she treat ya?

1236
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,266
She didn't like me as
much as she liked you.

1237
01:14:54,268 --> 01:14:55,868
Well, who does?

1238
01:15:00,374 --> 01:15:01,440
I'm sorry, Harris.

1239
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:03,709
I'm sorry for everything.

1240
01:15:05,446 --> 01:15:06,062
Wait.

1241
01:15:06,063 --> 01:15:06,679
It's been a year again here,

1242
01:15:06,681 --> 01:15:08,314
you really wanna
spend it this way?

1243
01:15:09,317 --> 01:15:10,549
You're right.

1244
01:15:10,551 --> 01:15:12,318
How do you wanna spend it?

1245
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,354
Well, my seat
belt's stuck again.

1246
01:15:20,561 --> 01:15:22,194
You can drink the water.

1247
01:15:23,297 --> 01:15:25,598
It's there so you
don't have to remember.

1248
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,667
I know, but I'm always
afraid I'll forget ya again.

1249
01:15:30,138 --> 01:15:33,439
Besides, I started
to see the nobility

1250
01:15:33,441 --> 01:15:35,508
in getting people to
their destination.

1251
01:15:40,314 --> 01:15:41,413
Selfish.

1252
01:15:41,415 --> 01:15:44,783
I was selfish, but you
started to remember me.

1253
01:15:44,785 --> 01:15:46,819
Stop, it's okay.

1254
01:15:46,821 --> 01:15:48,187
I'm sorry.

1255
01:15:48,189 --> 01:15:50,156
I'm eternally grateful
for what you did.

1256
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:50,756
Eternal.

1257
01:15:50,758 --> 01:15:51,590
Mm-hmm.

1258
01:15:51,592 --> 01:15:52,925
That's purgatory humor.

1259
01:15:54,228 --> 01:15:58,898
Look, I once told you
that remembering you

1260
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,633
was like waking up from a dream.

1261
01:16:02,236 --> 01:16:04,203
I've had a long time since
then to make sense of it,

1262
01:16:04,205 --> 01:16:05,905
to think about why it even
happened in the first place,

1263
01:16:05,907 --> 01:16:09,775
and one thing I know for
sure is before that night

1264
01:16:09,777 --> 01:16:12,745
I felt like I'd
forgotten my way home

1265
01:16:12,747 --> 01:16:15,915
even though it was
right in front of me.

1266
01:16:18,286 --> 01:16:21,320
But when I remembered
you and us that was home.

1267
01:16:28,262 --> 01:16:30,563
I remembered you because
you're the one thing in my life

1268
01:16:30,565 --> 01:16:31,630
worth holdin' onto.

1269
01:16:32,567 --> 01:16:34,967
It's 20 minutes a year.

1270
01:16:34,969 --> 01:16:36,335
Is it really worth
that much to you?

1271
01:16:36,337 --> 01:16:38,871
It's worth its
price in gold, baby.

1272
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:43,576
That's ferryman humor there.

1273
01:16:43,578 --> 01:16:45,311
I got that.

1274
01:16:45,313 --> 01:16:46,946
Many people go
their entire lives

1275
01:16:46,948 --> 01:16:48,614
without finding any meaning.

1276
01:16:48,615 --> 01:16:50,281
Believe me, I've driven my
share of them in the past year.

1277
01:16:50,284 --> 01:16:52,851
I consider myself lucky
to get 20 minutes.

1278
01:16:54,755 --> 01:16:56,388
So come on.

1279
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:58,390
This is our 20 minutes.

1280
01:16:58,392 --> 01:16:59,992
Let's talk about
something more interesting

1281
01:16:59,994 --> 01:17:01,644
than eternal suffering.

1282
01:17:01,645 --> 01:17:03,295
I get enough of
that in my day job.

1283
01:17:04,432 --> 01:17:05,464
Okay.

1284
01:17:05,466 --> 01:17:06,799
Yeah?

1285
01:17:06,801 --> 01:17:07,633
Yeah.

1286
01:17:07,635 --> 01:17:08,867
Yeah.

1287
01:17:08,869 --> 01:17:10,736
Okay, marry fuck kill.

1288
01:17:11,973 --> 01:17:13,339
You go first.

1289
01:18:15,803 --> 01:18:18,304
You would not believe
the amount of ways

1290
01:18:18,306 --> 01:18:19,605
that people die naked.

1291
01:18:26,414 --> 01:18:29,481
Well, Miss, I believe
this is your stop.

1292
01:18:31,952 --> 01:18:33,919
Please reconsider.

1293
01:18:33,921 --> 01:18:36,088
Penny, it's my choice.

1294
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:37,356
This is what I want.

1295
01:18:41,729 --> 01:18:43,495
As long as I can
remember you I got hope.

1296
01:18:45,366 --> 01:18:47,533
Then I'll always
be waiting for you.

1297
01:18:48,669 --> 01:18:51,904
And I'll always be
here to drive you.
