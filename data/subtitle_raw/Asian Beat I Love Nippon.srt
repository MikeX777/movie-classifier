1
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,020
I love Japanese.
They're all kind.

2
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,800
I love Japanese girls. Guys, too.
I love long-hair girls.

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,370
And I love petite ones, too.

4
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:32,280
I hate work, but I love money,
pleasure and disco.

5
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,020
I hate Japanese men,
because they're lewd.

6
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,130
The most interesting
places in Japan...

7
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,660
are Disneyland and Bay Bridge.

8
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:51,970
I love Japan, but Japanese
have cold heart.

9
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,080
Japanese are actually kind.

10
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,710
I bought a prostitute
in Japan one time.

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,280
I was supposed to pay 20.000 yen.

12
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:09,800
But she came to hotel, and looked at
me. Then, I must pay 25.000 yen.

13
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:17,910
Because I'm Asian, or maybe
because my skin is more dark.

14
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,480
I very angry after that time.

15
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,750
But important thing is...

16
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,170
I paid the moneys
she demanded me.

17
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:37,550
Some customers say we
Filipinos are mean and stupid.

18
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,370
Is sad. I think such customers
are base beings.

19
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,770
Because I'm not American, a girl
broke off a relationship with me.

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,600
We were pen-pals.

21
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,000
I requested a meeting and we met.

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,860
Won't see me again
because I'm Bangladeshi.

23
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,680
Even so, I love Japan.

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,670
Because it's so convenient
and great to live in.

25
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,460
But the people are...

26
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,860
<i>Tokio... Tokio...</i>

27
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,440
<i>I am... here.</i>

28
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,400
I want that.

29
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,350
Yes, ma'am.
You're a wise shopper.

30
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,750
- 1.000 yen.
- All right.

31
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,000
Here you have.

32
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,060
Tokio!

33
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,620
Did you quit the pachinko
parlor?

34
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,640
I did. Too noisy.

35
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,420
- Buy some.
- I don't want them.

36
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,420
Taiwanese bananas
are good.

37
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,510
- Give me one.
- Just one?

38
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,110
One bunch!
They're delicious!

39
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,640
Okay, you win.
Give me two.

40
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,330
Yes, sir.
700 yen.

41
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,660
Thank you!

42
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,620
How are you doing?

43
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,150
I'll give you one.
Don't go stealing.

44
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,330
Boss!

45
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,280
Wow...
Boss, what is this?

46
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,620
Shit.
How can we eat all this?

47
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,910
Tokio, I told them to send women.
Why do I get bananas?

48
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,880
Maybe they didn't
understand your English.

49
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,220
That bastard Tony!
Those primitive Filipinos are hopeless

50
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,460
Come on, eat some!

51
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,440
I bought these.

52
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,370
We aren't getting anywhere.

53
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,620
I can't eat anymore.

54
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,370
This is terrific.

55
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,420
Can't stand the banana smell!
Open the window.

56
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,080
What window?

57
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,280
Toa Detective Agency and
Far East Model Club.

58
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,240
Oh, that?
Yes, yes!

59
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,150
Can't you make the
conditions better?

60
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,910
There're illegal workers everywhere.
On the record, they're trainees.

61
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,530
That'll be fine. We'll deliver
5 Bangladeshi next week.

62
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:51,680
About their meals, no pork, okay?

63
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,970
Yes, it's a religious thing.

64
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:01,680
Huh? Well, tell them it's beef.
They won't know the difference.

65
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,710
Yes, yes, see you then.

66
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,200
5 Bangladeshi for a cast
factory in Kawaguchi.

67
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,080
Yes, sir.

68
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,750
We're only contributing to
Japan's internationalization...

69
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,820
But they try to bind
us with stupid laws.

70
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:27,460
We're doing a favor,
but they say it's illegal.

71
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,570
I hate this damn
oppressive country.

72
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,860
It's suffocating. Don't take me wrong.
I hate Asia, too.

73
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,530
They're all cheapskates.

74
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,600
Hey, what're you doing?

75
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,860
Bananas have the same
substance as LSD.

76
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,080
Working?

77
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,060
Not yet?

78
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,820
Yeah... it is.
A bit.

79
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:25,200
Is it working for you?

80
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,820
A bit.

81
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,150
What're all these bananas?

82
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,930
Honey!

83
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,970
I'm so glad to see you.

84
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,770
You told me to come.

85
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,170
What're all these bananas?

86
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,260
Did you keep my promise?

87
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,770
Yes, I dyed the hair down there.

88
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,480
It's sore.

89
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,240
Honey, I'll be right with you.

90
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,400
What're all these bananas?

91
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,930
Let's go, let's go!
Come with me.

92
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:25,820
Tokio, you poor thing.
I hear you can't get it up recently.

93
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,370
What?

94
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,420
Cecile at Bacchus told me.

95
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,020
That bitch!

96
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,460
What a pity.
You're still young.

97
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,600
I've got some pills that really work.

98
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,910
You'll have a hard-on all the time.

99
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,150
No thanks!

100
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:51,310
Unlike you, I function no matter
what color the chick's hair is.

101
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,840
Is that so?
Well, see you.

102
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,620
Trash the bananas.

103
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,260
What? All of them?

104
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,770
It's the wrong day for the garbage.

105
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,310
Can't you read?
You're trouble.

106
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,480
Loud-mouth bitch.
Fuck you.

107
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,040
What did you say?
I'll call the police.

108
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,020
Why the police?!

109
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,880
You're uptight.
What else do you have here?

110
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,370
Just bananas!

111
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,680
I wonder. I'll have the
police take a look.

112
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,970
Go ahead!

113
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,680
May I have some bananas?

114
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,060
Can I have some?

115
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,910
Sure, take all you like.

116
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,910
Thank you very much!

117
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,550
They're not good to eat.

118
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,000
- I make wine.
- Wine?

119
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,510
Yes, banana wine.

120
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:06,730
- Shall I carry some?
- Don't worry. My friends come later.

121
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,630
I take all.

122
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,130
<i>I'm Tokio.
What's your name?</i>

123
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,220
Banana.

124
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,110
This is the report for last week.

125
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:38,060
Tokyo East: 5 Pakistanis, 3 Filipinos
and 5 Red Chinese.

126
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:44,350
Tokyo South: 5 Filipinos, 2 Malays
and 3 Thais.

127
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:51,460
Tokyo North: 4 Bangladeshi,
2 Taiwanese and 6 Koreans.

128
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,620
Total: 32. We have asked them
to return to their homelands.

129
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,170
I am impressed by everyone's
remarkable efforts.

130
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,770
I repeat. It is best for the Asians
to live in their own countries.

131
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,310
We must have them leave
as soon as possible...

132
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,880
before they are reduced
to misery in Japan.

133
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:26,150
Well, our activities have just begun,
and we're a very small group.

134
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,350
The road we are paving...

135
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:34,110
will protect our beautiful homeland,
Japan, so that we may live...

136
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:41,110
in harmony with Asia,
where their homelands are.

137
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,820
I believe and look forward
to your endeavors...

138
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:54,110
to bring forth further results
to pave the correct road.

139
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,930
Now, all together.

140
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:16,840
<i>The yonder mountains
where I hunted rabbits</i>

141
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:25,280
<i>The yonder river where I fished</i>

142
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,840
<i>Such images appear...</i>

143
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,370
<i>in my dreams</i>

144
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:42,130
<i>Images of my unforgettable home</i>

145
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,750
Are you Tokio?

146
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,220
My name is Wang.
Yang's my friend.

147
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:36,000
You know Yang, the Chinaman?
He live same apartment you live.

148
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,840
Oh, that Yang.

149
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,400
I have no job.

150
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,860
Help me.

151
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:54,330
I speak little Japanese.
I need job.

152
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,420
Anything?

153
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:01,440
Yes, anything.
I start now.

154
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,680
Let's see...

155
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,760
Okay, okay!
I take it.

156
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,400
It's easy work.

157
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,240
Left-overs in here
and wash the dishes.

158
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,510
He's all yours.

159
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Put on the white overalls.

160
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:23,040
Tell him to wear clean ones everyday.
They are over there.

161
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:26,770
Foreigners aren't
sanitary conscious.

162
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,880
They must have different
standards.

163
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,400
See you, then.

164
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:34,950
I no can do this job.

165
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,990
You said anything was okay.

166
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,040
<i>I'm a pianist.
This is bad for my hands!</i>

167
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,220
<i>You said you'd do anything.</i>

168
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,400
<i>I'm a pianist!</i>

169
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,910
Don't be so fussy.

170
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,150
<i>You're impossible. All the jobs in
Japan are bad for your hands.</i>

171
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,130
<i>But I'm a pianist.</i>

172
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,550
<i>Get me a better job.</i>

173
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,280
Damn you.

174
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,020
<i>Say hi to Yang for me!</i>

175
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,750
- Hey, Tokio.
- Huh?

176
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,040
<i>Yang lost in mahjong game.
He said he'll run away.</i>

177
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,240
What? He owes me money!

178
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,800
Tokio, I need a job.
Anything okay!

179
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,110
Where's Yang?

180
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,600
He owes me 4 months rent.
That bastard!

181
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,260
You haven't paid this
month, either.

182
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,870
He owes me, too.

183
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,910
A bunch of gangsters came...

184
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,080
and took everything of value.

185
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,400
He imported a lot of fake
Chinese medicine.

186
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,400
Maybe we can sell that.

187
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,680
Nothing but trash left.

188
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,310
Didn't clean, didn't pay rent.

189
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,200
Chinese are the worst kind.

190
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,530
Hey, wait!

191
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,220
I'll take these as rent.

192
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,660
- He owes me, too!
- Wait, thief!

193
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,200
<i>You Japanese...</i>

194
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
<i>pick on us Koreans!</i>

195
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,600
What's this?

196
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,660
Don't you have any decency?

197
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:12,060
Hey, keep it down.

198
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,330
"In my bed, I caress..."

199
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,530
"the flower in bud."

200
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,550
"The warm of my hand..."

201
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:50,060
"will melt the snowy white skin."

202
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,020
Kabuki player Kikugoro said...

203
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,620
women should have cold hands.

204
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,860
I agree. I hate women
with clammy hands.

205
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:10,840
Really? I don't get turned on to
women with low body temperature.

206
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,750
You're sensitive to cold.

207
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:15,350
Ever made love to a dead woman?

208
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,400
No thanks. I have no trouble
getting live women.

209
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:26,110
Was certainly cold that time.
Her uterus was cold, too.

210
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,280
You've got some perverted tastes.

211
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,020
Women should be nice and warm.

212
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,080
You're right.

213
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,460
Dead women are so stiff.

214
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,100
"Mature women hate
to let us out."

215
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,310
It's getting lewd here...
attaboy!

216
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,930
Ever heard of banana wine?

217
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:02,730
I was down south during the war,
but I've never heard of it.

218
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:04,840
It's Filipino.

219
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,280
You know more about the Philippines.
He was in Sumatra.

220
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,480
We lived on bananas, but...

221
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,970
How's this?

222
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,880
- And this?
- All right!

223
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,860
Or this?

224
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,370
Now, what about this, then?

225
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,950
That's it!
Sorry, Tokio.

226
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:34,620
It's not bad.
Only 5.000 yen.

227
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,480
It's your unlucky day, Tokio.

228
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,800
I've had no luck recently.

229
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:44,370
At least, you still have an erection.

230
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:50,310
True! He's still young.
He can get lucky again.

231
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,570
It's the talk of town that
a rightist group...

232
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,550
is hunting down foreigners.

233
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:03,400
Those kids have no war experience.
What's got into them?

234
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:07,930
I was sent to China
when I was young.

235
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,240
That changed my life.

236
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,930
He became a pervert
because of the war.

237
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,400
I was a military policeman.

238
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,420
We'll end up in hell.
There's no way out.

239
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:28,350
Tokio, make sure you don't make
the same mistakes we did.

240
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,200
I'm not so sure.

241
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,730
That's it.
Sorry, Tokio.

242
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:43,600
Isn't she gorgeous?
Just like Madonna.

243
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,680
Miss Candy.

244
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,800
She'll make money.

245
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,840
A genuine blond singer.

246
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,660
And her singing's great.
Smashing.

247
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,840
You're right.
A real good-looking broad.

248
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,770
- Isn't that right?
- She's my type of broad.

249
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:10,040
- I knew you'd say that.
- It's decided, then. Get her next week.

250
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,680
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

251
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,820
Here's the down payment.

252
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:16,260
Oh, thanks!

253
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,260
You have pretty good taste.

254
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,180
Do you think so?

255
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,150
Broads like this are welcome.

256
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,480
You're right.
Hope to do business with you again.

257
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,020
Thank you! Thank you!

258
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,840
Tokio, I did it!

259
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,880
Blonds turn them on!

260
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,220
Boss, there seems to be...

261
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,970
a rightist group after the Asians.

262
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:03,530
Really? Asia is not in vogue now.
Blonds will rule the world.

263
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,750
I'll go buy some cigarettes.

264
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,080
What happened?

265
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:23,640
Tokio, tell your boss that
I'll never do that again.

266
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:30,260
It's swollen down there from dying
the hair. I can't work like this.

267
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,930
What are you doing?!

268
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,620
You pervert!

269
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,040
Oh, hi, Banana.

270
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,530
Tokio, you lousy pachinko player.

271
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,150
Shut up!
Hold your tongue, woman.

272
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,330
- You don't know.
- I'll teach you.

273
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,370
You play like this.

274
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,620
That's dangerous!

275
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:13,170
You've got guts.
Where did you get the keys?

276
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,170
I found them.

277
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,570
Tokio, banana wine is ready.
Come drink it.

278
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,080
Can you really make
wine from bananas?

279
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,080
It's good.

280
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,080
My God!

281
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,420
Wait.

282
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,910
Oh, Banana, are you from Luzon?

283
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,620
Mindanao.

284
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,220
Mindanao, huh? I don't recall
banana wine in Mindanao.

285
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,620
My invention. It's delicious.

286
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,860
It looks terrible.

287
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:46,080
Noisy here. I know good place.
Let's drink there.

288
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Terrific. Wow.

289
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,750
Banana Special.

290
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,020
This will give you power.

291
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:00,000
You'll get a hard-on.

292
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,670
What do you do for a living?

293
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,670
- Pachinko?
- Of course not!

294
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,860
I worked in a karaoke joint.

295
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,420
In Tokyo?

296
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:23,750
No, in Toyama.
I ran away because promotor was bad.

297
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,460
He won't pay. Beat me.
It was cold.

298
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,280
Customers were lewd.

299
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,280
What're you doing now?

300
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,570
All kinds.

301
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:38,190
Pachinko, slot machine, mahjong...

302
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,110
horse races, poker...

303
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,170
A woman gambler, huh?
Do you always cheat?

304
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,840
Japanese are poor gamblers.

305
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,710
I'm good gambler.
I always win.

306
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,550
Cheating is thrilling.
I love the thrill!

307
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,720
Be serious.

308
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,660
You'd better watch out.

309
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:10,860
Some goons are hunting
down Asians recently.

310
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,860
Goons?
I don't understand.

311
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,550
<i>Why? Japanese are rich.</i>

312
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,600
<i>Why pick on us?</i>

313
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,350
<i>Filipinas are tough.</i>

314
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,200
<i>Nonsense.</i>

315
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:36,510
<i>Do you know what Japan did and
is now doing in my homeland?</i>

316
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:40,200
I know about it.
I really do.

317
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,110
<i>Where did you learn Tagalog?</i>

318
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:51,750
In the Philippines long ago. I was
in Mindanao, and Davao, too.

319
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,080
Davao is not Mindanao.

320
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,640
I was born in Cagayan de Oro.

321
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,260
In the north, huh?

322
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,510
It's all right.

323
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,220
What's going on?

324
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,130
Teresa's old trick.

325
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,350
Thank you!

326
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,440
Be brave, okay?

327
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,880
I will.
Thanks...

328
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,130
Banana!

329
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,130
Teresa, banana wine.

330
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,610
Booze.

331
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,880
You never give up, Teresa.

332
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,550
Badger Japanese men.
Barn lots of money.

333
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:30,640
Teresa send money for
her baby in Bankok.

334
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,570
How much?

335
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,930
500.000 yen a month.

336
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,640
Wow!
No kidding?

337
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,950
My family very poor.

338
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:47,620
Big family, many relatives.

339
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,330
- And many lovers.
- Banana!

340
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:55,240
Hey, I'm Tokio.

341
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,550
I'm poor. This is true.

342
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:06,040
No family, no relatives.
No girlfriend either.

343
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,200
Poor Tokio.

344
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,800
Broke up with girlfriend?

345
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,060
My girlfriend...

346
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,550
Tokio, cheer up.

347
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,750
You'll meet her.

348
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,730
If Teresa gives me a free
ride, I'll cheer up.

349
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,640
- Dirty old man!
- Ouch, that hurts!

350
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:24,620
What do you want?

351
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:33,240
We are the Asian Homeland Society.

352
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,150
So what?

353
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,110
I'm a busy man. Fuck off.

354
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,840
They're all on tourist visa.

355
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,270
You shouldn't be doing this.
Aren't you Japanese?!

356
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,200
You pollute Japanese blood...

357
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,530
with your two-bit business.

358
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,280
What's it to you?
Asshole!

359
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,060
What you are doing is blasphemy.

360
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,510
Pure blasphemy!

361
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,040
Sucking blood from Asia...

362
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,400
and cause Japan to rot.

363
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,680
I really despise you.

364
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,280
- Disgusting...
- Hey.

365
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,770
- You...
- Hey!

366
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,480
Do you know why
Japan is beautiful?

367
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,480
Why it was able to be
developed this much?

368
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:30,040
Why Japan is called the leader of Asia?

369
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,930
It's all because we're a
homogeneous nation.

370
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,460
If the dirty Asian blood mixes...

371
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:42,350
Japan's beauty and her
superiority will deteriorate.

372
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,860
Listen, we Japanese are
the chosen people.

373
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,750
Haven't you bastards
studied history?

374
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,550
Homogeneous? You believe this shit?
That's a big fat lie!

375
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,480
Faggot.

376
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:13,840
Why should I allow a traitor
scum like you disgrace me?

377
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:18,930
Your ideas are dangerous.
We should talk someday.

378
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:25,420
Big talk now, but you'll
soon beg for mercy.

379
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,400
What shall we do?

380
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,020
Punish him and then dump him.

381
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:45,110
It's cold. Fuck you!

382
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,970
Those guys are bad news.

383
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,570
I'm sure that's Ohtsuki.

384
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,240
You know him?

385
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,770
He was with the Cleanse Japan
Youth Legion Homogeneous Congress.

386
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,000
He's like a mad dog.

387
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,220
That famous?

388
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,330
I had trouble with him long ago.

389
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,950
Trouble?

390
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,510
Before I began this business...

391
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,610
I took part in an ecology movement.

392
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,660
You're really a joke.

393
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,240
Shut up.

394
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:30,330
What's wrong with
Love and Peace?

395
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:35,710
Anyway, when we held a meeting...

396
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,750
he wrecked the meeting
all by himself.

397
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,710
That was the end of
our movement.

398
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,570
He's insane.
Keep away from him.

399
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:51,680
He must be after your
Asian friends, too.

400
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,130
Hello!

401
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,220
Excuse me.

402
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,770
Excuse me!

403
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,080
It's amazing how so many
were able to live there.

404
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,350
I live here, but I had no idea.

405
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:09,770
I knew dark faces
were increasing...

406
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,640
but I never thought
they were here.

407
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,930
You're a strange boy.
Playing with us old folks.

408
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,150
Here he goes again.

409
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:26,020
I don't have friends. I specialize
in foreigners and old folks.

410
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,040
This parlor is closing
down next week.

411
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,620
Is that true?

412
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,040
Land re-development.

413
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:39,240
Tokyo has completely changed.
There's no place for us anymore.

414
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,880
I see.
So, it's closing down...

415
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,170
Old soldiers only fade away.
Tokio, your future will be rough.

416
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,800
Pretty soon, Japan will
be completely different.

417
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,390
More foreigners.

418
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:02,910
Whether they're foreigners or not,
skinship will solve it.

419
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,170
And if you get close,
quarrels begin.

420
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,880
Quarrel, make up and quarrel again.

421
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:20,530
And someday, we'll all grow up.

422
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:24,710
That's it!
Sorry, Tokio.

423
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,950
Are you sure it's today?
She wasn't there...

424
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,660
This is her.

425
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,550
Your blond broad... Candy?

426
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:24,600
Can she sing?

427
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:28,080
I had her sing...

428
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,140
And?

429
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,970
I'm going to Manila to kill
that son-of-a-bitch Tony.

430
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,020
A Madonna look-alike, huh?

431
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,020
Her singing makes me puke.

432
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:47,280
I don't believe this.
What should I do?

433
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,080
I remembered!
I've got to some urgent business.

434
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,770
- Don't leave me here.
- My half-brother's dying.

435
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,460
Damn it, Tokio.
You're dead, too.

436
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,970
You made a big mistake, Sumio.

437
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,400
I'm disappointed in you.

438
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:19,640
You let the woman get away.

439
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,640
I'm deeply sorry!

440
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,150
We have a guest.

441
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,950
Mr. Gonzalez, this is Morita.

442
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:44,970
What we're looking for
was not in that hide-out.

443
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,740
The woman took it.

444
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:53,910
Mr. Gonzalez, take Morita with you.
He's at your service.

445
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:57,280
Chairman, I don't understand.

446
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,530
He's a savage!

447
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:05,420
Sumio, no racial discrimination.

448
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,930
It's for Japan.

449
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,930
Your enemy's enemy
is your friend.

450
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,130
This is how politics work.

451
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,020
What did the woman run off with?

452
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:58,170
If you find out...

453
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:04,060
Big deal.
Hey, why don't we split?

454
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:07,640
I'm told we work together.

455
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:09,400
What?

456
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:14,530
I'm a rightist, damn it!

457
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,110
It's my job to kick out Asians.

458
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,930
Why do I have to work
with a Filipino scum?

459
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,880
Searching for a Filipino woman?
So typical.

460
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,170
You betray your own people.

461
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:36,930
If someone does a good job,
you tell the police it's a murder.

462
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,040
Thwarting each other.

463
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,170
Have no mind to be
happy together.

464
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,210
Why do I have to stick my
nose in your trouble?

465
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,570
You're wrong.

466
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:54,550
This is not for Philippines.
It's for Japan.

467
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:57,040
I can't trust you.

468
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:00,440
Because you're not Japanese!

469
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:06,460
- Make your boss angry?
- I'll get the woman, anyway.

470
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,660
I live for my country.
Not for pride!

471
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:16,260
I'll go this way, you go that way.
Don't you dare follow me.

472
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,840
<i>The Homeland Society, huh?</i>

473
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:32,970
<i>You deported my woman
back to Korea.</i>

474
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,220
Next time, we'll kill you for sure.

475
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,080
You all right?

476
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:57,080
- Banana!
- Sorry...

477
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:59,080
You all right?

478
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,310
Yes?

479
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,860
What? I paid the rent.

480
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,570
It's not about that, Mr. Atori.

481
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:29,460
What did you do with the junk
you took from Yang's room?

482
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:31,930
Oh, it's there.

483
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:40,660
- Take it all.
- Oh, no, it's not here!

484
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,150
Wasn't there anything
like an arm?

485
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:47,660
That was eerie.
I put it in the garbage.

486
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,800
The rats are eating it by now.

487
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,770
- What's wrong?
- All my hopes are gone...

488
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:59,510
I'll be killed.

489
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,930
What's going on?

490
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:09,730
I'm a little diabetic.
And I can't get it up.

491
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,040
My wife beats me every night.

492
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:20,170
My mistress kicks me.
She's a martial arts champion.

493
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:24,820
The way things are,
my life is at peril!

494
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:27,930
Hold on, what's that arm
got to do with it?

495
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,730
Yang's friends are
looking for that.

496
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:36,330
Yang won that at some
gambling scam.

497
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,200
He didn't know what it was.
I do, did homework.

498
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:45,130
That is the ultimate Chinese medicine,
made with 3.000 years of wisdom!

499
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:48,280
That is the world's
greatest aphrodisiac.

500
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:53,730
They say even a dying elephant
will have an erection with that.

501
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:58,310
That... was the legendary medicine.

502
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:01,040
I threw it out...

503
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:06,130
Goodbye.

504
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:20,200
No erection, better dead.

505
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:30,820
Are you okay?

506
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,770
Wait here.

507
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,020
Found it!

508
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,750
You'd better stay out
of Tokyo for a while.

509
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:08,130
Those bastards are insane.
Really persistent.

510
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:11,280
I stay in Tokyo.

511
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:14,550
Still want to make money?

512
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,710
Guess Filipino economy survives
on money you guys make abroad.

513
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,820
This your girlfriend?

514
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:30,400
We were separated when
my dad was murdered.

515
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:33,820
- Murdered?
- By terrorists.

516
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,280
The guerrillas in Mindanao.

517
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:42,110
- Why?
- Probably because he was Japanese.

518
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:49,130
Tokio, you hate Filipinos?

519
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:55,200
Banana, you hate the Japanese,

520
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,750
but you earn money here.

521
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,680
It's a big lie that Asia is one.

522
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:07,060
Even the same race hate
and kill each other.

523
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,730
When interests conflict,
anyone can be your enemy.

524
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:18,080
I'm not strong enough
to hate all Filipinos.

525
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:20,280
Not that serious.

526
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:32,510
But the N.P.A. guerrillas killed my father.
I'll kill them someday with my own hands.

527
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,480
I'm Japanese...

528
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:38,200
But I am myself.

529
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:42,310
I'm not interested in what
people do or their nationality.

530
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:46,420
I'll hate and love people
with my own rules.

531
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,440
That's not realistic.

532
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,950
Then, something's wrong!

533
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:55,600
Tokio, you impotent?

534
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:00,130
Hey...
Don't be ridiculous!

535
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,200
- Poor thing.
- Shut up!

536
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,950
Get out when you're well!

537
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,420

Hey, what the hell is this?

550
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:44,930
That's not what we agreed on.

551
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,570
- You deceived me!
- It was a mistake.

552
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:57,240
Foreign bitch, out of the way!

553
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:03,510
What the hell?!

554
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,640
- Damn it...
- Candy, don't!

555
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,530
Excuse me...
This is your down payment.

556
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,330
Please.
Let's call it a day.

557
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,220
So, Madonna's a wrestler, huh?

558
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:28,880
What are you saying,
you white hippo?!

559
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,280
Mafia boss?

560
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:01,600
Boss...
You're having a fine time.

561
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,710
Where the hell were you?

562
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:09,440
Toa Detective Agency,
and Far East Model Club.

563
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,170
<i>Tokio?</i>

564
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,120
You're speaking to him.

565
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:17,600
Hi, long time, no see.

566
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:23,700
What do you want?

567
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:26,620
Let's meet.

568
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:31,200
No thanks.
You're bad news.

569
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:33,530
That's a compliment.

570
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:39,680
It's about Banana, the girl
you're keeping in your apartment.

571
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,640
She's in danger.

572
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,530
We'll talk about her.

573
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,550
Are you interested?

574
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,960
7:00 at the Golden Plaza.

575
00:59:55,970 --> 01:00:00,370
Nice to see you.
You look well.

576
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,420
You became a fine young man.

577
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:08,910
Who's after Banana?
And why?

578
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:11,350
Don't rush.

579
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,750
Do you want a drink?

580
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,770
Brandy?

581
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,620
Cut out the crap.

582
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:20,710
Get to the point.
I'm busy.

583
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:22,830
All right.

584
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,460
Banana is an...

585
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:39,440
N.P.A. activist. She's a member of
New People's Army Sparrow Unit...

586
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:44,260
...which killed your father.

587
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:50,240
My God, you didn't know?

588
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,820
All right... go on.

589
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,800
Since last year...

590
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:04,440
Japanese companies in South-East Asia
have been attacked by terrorists.

591
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:10,600
She has an illustrious record.

592
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:17,660
She brought in some data, concerning
activities of Japanese companies.

593
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:23,710
They could be very
dangerous for Japan...

594
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:30,730
and trouble for me,
if made public.

595
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:38,330
You know the Asia Homeland
Society, don't you?

596
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:46,280
They're looking for the data by
orders of some powerful people.

597
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,220
You want me to hand
Banana over?

598
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,680
Yes, you can be rich.

599
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:01,020
I'm only interested in the data.

600
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,240
No thanks!

601
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:06,280
What's the rush?

602
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:10,680
I see.
Then, think about it.

603
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,820
My number's registered here.
Call me.

604
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:18,970
You still have bad taste.

605
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:20,800
None of your business.

606
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,710
Lay off!

607
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,150
Tokio!

608
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,860
You're really a pianist.

609
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:52,370
Tokio, what happened?

610
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:54,300
Nothing.

611
01:02:56,460 --> 01:03:01,420
I play plano. I also have many
other work. Everything okay.

612
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,950
Girls, guns, drugs, passports...

613
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,130
Everything.

614
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:15,170
- Give you discount.
- Not today.

615
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:18,620
Wait.

616
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:24,200
Tokio, you be careful.

617
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:32,730
I good fortune-teller.

618
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:39,420
I see in your face, something
bad will happen.

619
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,130
Don't worry.

620
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:45,480
I know good magic spell.

621
01:03:45,770 --> 01:03:47,620
Give you discount.

622
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:50,160
Some other time.

623
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:54,220
Tokio, you watch out.

624
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:59,660
<i>Korean Barbecue</i>

625
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,570
Hey!

626
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,950
Yes... yes, dear.

627
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:18,770
Welcome.

628
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:27,330
What's happening?

629
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:30,080
Change business.

630
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,840
I'm opening an English
conversation school with Candy.

631
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,930
Want to join us, Tokio?

632
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,510
No thanks.

633
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:49,820
You were great.
This month's salary.

634
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:52,460
Thank you.

635
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:55,020
Tokio, keep up your spirits.

636
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,440
Yeah.
You, too, boss.

637
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:05,220
Love and Peace forever, baby.

638
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,660
Right, some girl called you up.
Banana or papaya, or something.

639
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:16,420
- What did she say?
- "Come to the cemetery."

640
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:57,420
Have you seen my right arm?

641
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:02,220
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

642
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:14,510
- Tokio!
- Banana!

643
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:18,510
Tokio, I have no time.
Keep this.

644
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:21,310
- I run away.
- Wait a moment, Banana.

645
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:26,060
- Are you really a guerrilla member?
- That's right.

646
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:29,330
The same group that killed
your father.

647
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,330
- I...
- No need.

648
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,910
I bellieve in you.

649
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:38,800
I'll keep the data.
No one will touch it.

650
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:42,510
I may not return them
to you, though

651
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:46,420
Okay.
But I didn't come as a terrorist.

652
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:48,400
Then, what for?

653
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:52,600
We have no money.
Terrorism is expensive.

654
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:55,910
I came to Japan to earn money.

655
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:59,080
Blow up Japanese companies
with money earned here?

656
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:03,330
- Bit embarrassing.
- So, that's what you did...

657
01:08:04,710 --> 01:08:07,040
If this goes public,
no need for terrorism!

658
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:09,280
No one will print it.

659
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:12,840
- Why?!
- That's the real world.

660
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,890
<i>I'm sorry for getting you involved.</i>

661
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,660
<i>Should be.</i>

662
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:22,350
Sorry.

663
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:24,880
Watch out.

664
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:28,460
Don't worry.
I take care of myself.

665
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:34,170
<i>You are the first
Japanese I slept with.</i>

666
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:49,710
Romantic sequences are over.

667
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,640
Hand over the data.

668
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,370
You faggot!

669
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,600
- Banana, run!
- Hand them over.

670
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,150
<i>Glad to see you again.</i>

671
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:35,330
<i>Traitor. You take money from Japanese
companies to betray your comrades.</i>

672
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,060
<i>Tell me all you know.</i>

673
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:49,860
Mr. Gonzalez, take her back to
the Philippines and torture her!

674
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:52,460
Make her talk!

675
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,480
Banana!

676
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:09,020
Tokio, you know nothing...

677
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:25,080
Goodbye!

678
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:28,930
Banana!

679
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:35,600
Shit! She's dead...

680
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:42,350
Better to die than to be handed
over to the security police.

681
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:43,710
Let's see!

682
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:47,260
You're supposed to have
committed double suicide...

683
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:49,550
to resolve your dead-end
romance.

684
01:10:49,730 --> 01:10:53,460
It's the most beautiful
way to die.

685
01:10:54,510 --> 01:11:00,750
Be grateful! You two can
reincarnate as crickets.

686
01:11:01,020 --> 01:11:07,150
Then, you can mate all you want,
all sing all night long.

687
01:11:25,710 --> 01:11:27,400
Morita, you...

688
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:36,370
Banana... Banana!

689
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:55,200
I was a fisherman
in Nagasaki.

690
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:59,510
Poor Banana...

691
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,800
I've decided to raise
a family with her.

692
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,400
Tokio, Banana is...

693
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:16,800
No time for tears.

694
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,110
What made you decide on that?

695
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:29,600
A Japanese man cannot throw
away his ideals for a woman.

696
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:33,900
So, I've decided to become a Thai.

697
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:39,680
Sumio, you're renouncing
your homeland for a cunt?!

698
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,280
I'll go to Thailand to make
money on the Japanese.

699
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:55,000
I don't believe this. She has a baby.
Must earn a lot.

700
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:02,280
Hey, hurry up and go.
Quick, go!

701
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:05,640
Right? Hurry up and leave!

702
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,040
I'll get even.

703
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,200
<i>In Johoku Cemetery in Tokyo...</i>

704
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:40,710
<i>a young woman, seemingly a
Filipina, was found murdered.</i>

705
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,950
<i>Her neck and abdomen were
stabbed by a knife.</i>

706
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:48,840
<i>She was found some 30
minutes after she died.</i>

707
01:13:48,930 --> 01:13:51,710
<i>The police think this is
a crime of passion.</i>

708
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:56,570
<i>They are looking for Tokio Atori,
age 26, currently unemployed...</i>

709
01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:59,350
<i>He is reported to be
the woman's lover.</i>

710
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:01,680
<i>Now for some bright news...</i>

711
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:30,440
<i>Let's walk with your head up...</i>

712
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:33,730
<i>so the tears won't...</i>

713
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:41,040
<i>roll down your cheeks.</i>

714
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:50,640
<i>Walking all alone in the night...</i>

715
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:57,420
<i>with tears in my eyes.</i>

716
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:08,860
<i>Tokio, you know nothing.</i>

717
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:31,440
<i>You're Tokio. Hand over the
data and I'll help you.</i>

718
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:33,860
I'll give them to the press.

719
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:35,600
<i>Go ahead.</i>

720
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:39,370
<i>But if you don't give
me the data...</i>

721
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,910
<i>you'll be killed no matter
where you go.</i>

722
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:45,440
I won't play by your rules!

723
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:34,600
Hey, what are you doing?
That hurts!

724
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:39,480
Ouch, let me go!

725
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:01,950
I've received the data.

726
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,600
Thank you.

727
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:08,770
I'm sorry about Banana.

728
01:17:09,860 --> 01:17:11,460
Damn you.

729
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,600
It's not fair to blame me.

730
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:18,280
What were you going
to do with the data?

731
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:24,530
Blow up Japanese companies
in her place.

732
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:29,970
She was a terrorist and you're not.
That's life.

733
01:17:30,910 --> 01:17:37,400
You're a Japanese, after all.
Be a good Japanese.

734
01:17:39,970 --> 01:17:42,820
Here's your reward.

735
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:46,660
I'll also guarantee your freedom.

736
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:54,240
Remember, Tokio Atori is
supposed to be dead.

737
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,080
He committed double suicide
with an Asian prostitute.

738
01:17:59,530 --> 01:18:02,800
Banana's murder is
a crime of passion.

739
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:04,950
Killed Teresa!

740
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,110
Who?

741
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:12,620
From today, you're a
different person.

742
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,350
This is you.

743
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:28,680
It'll take 3 months for the bodies
to be found. Leave Tokyo.

744
01:18:29,530 --> 01:18:31,950
The rest is up to you.

745
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:37,950
Why not work for me?

746
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:40,550
You bitch!

747
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:45,840
I am myself!

748
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:50,020
I live by my rules.

749
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:54,440
I'm sick of you and this country!

750
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:35,880
I'll keep in touch.

751
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:52,350
Tokio is dead.
Lay off!

752
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:54,060
Why, sir.

753
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,240
Tokio is dead!

754
01:20:07,310 --> 01:20:09,420
This is an order of the state.

755
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:11,960
Forget Tokio!

756
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:13,080
Why?

757
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:41,530
Remember, Tokio is dead.

758
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:42,800
Why, sir?

759
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,240
What happened to Tokio?

760
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,860
He's dead sir.

761
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:03,840
Can you touch him?

762
01:21:05,130 --> 01:21:06,570
No, sir...

763
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,930
Good, you seem to understand.

764
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:35,680
Sasaki, how did it go
with the horse races?

765
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:40,370
Big hit on Race 8, sir.
Thank you for your tip, sir!

766
01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:44,770
What're you doing?

767
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,880
Get my luggage.

768
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:48,600
I go back tomorrow.

769
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:51,800
Gonzalez, why don't you
and I burn that kid?

770
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:53,880
Woman is dead.

771
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:56,200
The secret is safe.

772
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,680
My business finished.

773
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:02,150
That's why you people are
nothing but savages.

774
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:05,060
We Japanese will not forget shame.

775
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:08,460
Shame must be paid with life.

776
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:12,370
I'm going home.

777
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:16,300
This is your country.

778
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:19,660
You're free to kill
yourselves off.

779
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,420
Hey, it's me.

780
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,600
Tokio, what's matter?

781
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,370
You need something?

782
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,370
Must leave Japan.

783
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:41,970
Who?

784
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:44,680
Me. I have a reason.

785
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:47,150
I'm renouncing Japan.

786
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:50,710
Your head very funny.

787
01:23:51,110 --> 01:23:52,910
Japan is paradise.

788
01:23:53,370 --> 01:23:57,550
Money, merchandise, women...
you can get anything!

789
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:08,220
I need a counterfeit passport
and a way out.

790
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:12,570
- You serious?
- I have money.

791
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:21,060
Okay!
Go to Mack and...

792
01:24:21,370 --> 01:24:24,620
you tell what nationality you want.

793
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:27,200
Tell him Wang send you.

794
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:33,000
It'll be okay.
This is introduction fee.

795
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,060
Hey, Mack, right?

796
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,270
Pakistani. You same apartment,
next room.

797
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:02,400
Tokio, why you want to leave?
It's a wonderful country.

798
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:06,280
It's crazy.
This is your homeland.

799
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,530
I found it!

800
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:02,000
<i>Help!</i>

801
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:14,460
Where's Tokio, huh?!

802
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,680
Maria...
Is that you, Maria?

803
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:27,150
Understand?

804
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:40,880
Money.

805
01:28:57,770 --> 01:28:59,620
Filipino...

806
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,020
Taiwanese...

807
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:10,040
Malaysian...

808
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:15,660
Boat at Pier 7.

809
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,130
3 A.M.

810
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:22,970
Be punctual.

811
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,000
Thanks.

812
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:33,110
With these, I can settle
down somewhere.

813
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:45,310
Punk, you're mine.

814
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:17,480
You, I cannot pardon.

815
01:31:21,130 --> 01:31:22,530
You're persistent!

816
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:25,800
Shut up!
Can't get you off my conscience.

817
01:31:27,460 --> 01:31:30,800
I'll make you suffer good.

818
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:33,600
Then, I'll kill you.

819
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:46,660
What's this?
"Made-in-China" are so unrealiable!

820
01:31:47,020 --> 01:31:49,260
Serves you right, faggot!

821
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:51,510
You two-bit punk!

822
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:59,170
Fruit cake, I'm leaving Japan.
No time to play with you.

823
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:01,020
So what?

824
01:32:01,110 --> 01:32:02,880
Nothing else matters.

825
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:05,480
Except that I detest you.

826
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:08,680
Wherever you are, you're mine.

827
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:13,060
I detest you.
That's why I'll kill you.

828
01:32:13,620 --> 01:32:17,220
I see.
I understand!

829
01:32:18,040 --> 01:32:23,530
The feeling's... mutual.

830
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,370
Horny bastard!

831
01:32:31,950 --> 01:32:33,330
Piss ass!

832
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:37,350
Cocktail weenie!

833
01:32:38,370 --> 01:32:40,240
Banana scum!

834
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,200
Shit head!

835
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:48,150
Asian cunt!

836
01:32:55,330 --> 01:32:56,970
Lunatic!

837
01:33:17,130 --> 01:33:18,950
Imbecile!

838
01:34:45,800 --> 01:34:47,510
Oh, shit!

839
01:35:18,110 --> 01:35:22,840
Oh, my passports!
The passports...

840
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,710
<i>Since you're on my boat...</i>

841
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:46,930
<i>you have the duty to take my orders.</i>

842
01:35:48,730 --> 01:35:54,680
<i>If you complain, l'll throw
you in the ocean.</i>

843
01:35:55,170 --> 01:36:00,060
<i>All is fate.
You are here, this is fate.</i>

844
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:01,710
Passports...

845
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:06,460
<i>Blind belief is no good.
But ignoring is worse.</i>

846
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:11,370
<i>Make friends with fate and live.</i>

847
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:14,600
What're you saying?

848
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:22,330
Hey, this is too much.

849
01:36:59,220 --> 01:37:04,600
Pop...
Pop, your telephone!

850
01:37:05,420 --> 01:37:09,020
I said the phone's ringing!

851
01:37:39,570 --> 01:37:40,680
Hello?

852
01:37:41,550 --> 01:37:45,680
<i>Tokio, I have a favor to ask you.</i>

853
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:48,280
What are you anyway?

854
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:50,770
<i>Don't be angry.</i>

855
01:37:51,330 --> 01:37:54,400
<i>Since you're leaving Japan,
work for me.</i>

856
01:37:55,150 --> 01:38:00,800
<i>I'm busy because there is
trouble all over Asia.</i>

857
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,240
Listen.

858
01:38:02,770 --> 01:38:05,160
I only play by my own rules!

859
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:09,950
<i>Do you understand the
sad feeling of this song?</i>

860
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:14,130
<i>Okay.</i>

861
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,910
<i>This man's putting out to sea.
Sing for him.</i>

862
01:39:18,570 --> 01:39:22,400
<i>Please sing a song for him.</i>

863
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:38,680
<i>On the clear waters of the river,
a boatman sings</i>

864
01:39:39,350 --> 01:39:46,820
<i>Years long past, he sailed
away on a boat</i>

865
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:50,280
<i>Where has that boat gone?</i>

866
01:39:50,330 --> 01:39:55,950
Life is sad, but is also merry.

867
01:39:56,530 --> 01:40:09,330
<i>I miss you, dear</i>

868
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:15,400
<i>You, my dearest</i>

869
01:40:15,550 --> 01:40:24,330
