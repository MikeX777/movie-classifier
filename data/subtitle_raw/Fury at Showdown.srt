1
00:00:02,232 --> 00:00:04,899
(ominous music)

2
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:47,400
- Looking for someone, son?

3
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,733
- I've come to fetch my brother.

4
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,573
- Yeah.

5
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,783
- All right Mitchell, your year's up.

6
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:15,853
- [Mitchell] It didn't
seen like more than ten.

7
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,640
- You're lucky it wasn't the rope.

8
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:22,733
- It looks like the citizens
out there still have ideas.

9
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,160
They don't like gunfighters,

10
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,093
especially drifters and strangers.

11
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,363
We'll take care of them for now.

12
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,073
The next time you have to
come through this town, don't.

13
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,770
All right, give him his gun.

14
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,230
Don't put it on till
you've got out of town.

15
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,143
Wait here.

16
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,280
What do you men want?

17
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,610
- You know what we want.

18
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,500
- You'll have to call it.

19
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,680
- Sure, we'll call it, Brock Mitchell.

20
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,900
- All right, now you'll listen to me.

21
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,840
- Oh, we listen to you what!

22
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,130
You'll have your own way
when he gunned Frank Wilson,

23
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,550
- Wilson was always trouble,

24
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,430
he asked for it.

25
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,233
- Frank Wilson was one of our boys.

26
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,981
- Wilson, forced Mitchell to draw.

27
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:41,910
I know his reputation wanted
to prove he was faster

28
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,743
than Mitchell.

29
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,040
Wilson lost.

30
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,150
- Yeah, Wilson lost,

31
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,470
because we let you take Mitchell

32
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,180
when you promised they'd get justice.

33
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,060
- But you've crossed us.

34
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,320
Well, we've waited now
we'll see who gets justice.

35
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,720
- Mitchell's done his years.

36
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,180
Under the circumstances that was justice.

37
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,683
Now he leaves town, safe.

38
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,063
Anybody has any other ideas
they come up against me first.

39
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,263
- Hi Brock.

40
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,260
Brought you the colt.

41
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,870
Remember him?

42
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,770
- He's grown some.

43
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,333
- Move.

44
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,543
- Bye sheriff.

45
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,060
Sometime I'd like you to be my guest.

46
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,320
- Remember, if you ever come

47
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,890
through this town here again,

48
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,313
I might not be here,

49
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,342
but they will.

50
00:05:37,342 --> 00:05:40,342
(suspenseful music)

51
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,810
- The railroad will be laying new tracks

52
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,010
starting next month.

53
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,640
Nobody but us and ours ranch,

54
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,210
and Riley's out there to supply beef

55
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,090
for a couple of thousand workers.

56
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,180
- How'd you keep all this
going after pop died?

57
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,023
- Well, I always figured, I
hoped one day you'd be back.

58
00:06:03,194 --> 00:06:05,343
Had to have someplace
for you to come back to.

59
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,080
So Mr. Van Steeden at the
bank gave me a loan of 5,000

60
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,913
on our place,

61
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,280
and now with the railroad contract,

62
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,390
it'll be easy to pay off the bank

63
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,230
and plenty leftover.

64
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,997
- You're a very great, Trace.

65
00:06:16,997 --> 00:06:17,849
- The best.

66
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:19,682
Come on, let's hustle.

67
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,970
Norris and Riley are meeting us in town.

68
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,340
Phelps, the railroad agent is coming in

69
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,440
on the afternoon stage with the contracts.

70
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,233
One thing.
- Yeah.

71
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,902
Chad Deezy is in town.

72
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:37,610
- I thought he had his loggers in Fisco.

73
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,510
He came back after you and
his brother had the showdown.

74
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,130
Now that around that
he just wait patiently

75
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,180
for you to come back.

76
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,010
Please, keep hope, Brock,
don't let him push you.

77
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,528
- I am to hang onto my skinny chance.

78
00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:51,889
- Yeah.

79
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,889
(suspenseful music)

80
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:13,796
(horses neighing)

81
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,435
- Mitchell, I wanna talk you.

82
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,291
(suspenseful music)

83
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,760
I got word from the sheriff in Buckhorn

84
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,453
you were heading this way.

85
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,550
Also from every Sheriff's on
every town you had pass through

86
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,670
from there to here.

87
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,260
- It's nice of them to look out for me.

88
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,960
- All men look out for each other.

89
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,563
I bet time are out of
bounds to you, Mitchell.

90
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:57,500
I'm telling you right now

91
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,343
I don't like your being
here and Showdown Creek.

92
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:04,470
- I don't like you not
liking me being here.

93
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,403
This is my home.

94
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,260
- Got no cause to run you
out of town at least not now,

95
00:09:11,142 --> 00:09:12,580
but you take one step out of line,

96
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,780
I'm gonna make you move.

97
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,930
I am to keep this a law abiding town.

98
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,680
I'm not gonna let you repeat
what you did two years ago,

99
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,793
- Sim Deasy drew on me.
- Have you made him draw?

100
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,960
Maybe there was another reason.

101
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:38,310
- It had nothing to do with your daughter.

102
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,470
- Come on.

103
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,467
- I said my say.

104
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,560
- Yeah, that's how it was, Trace.

105
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,430
Everybody believes I gun Sim Deasy,

106
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,563
because he was seeing Ginny, even Ginny.

107
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,110
That's why I left.

108
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,010
- This aint going to be easy,

109
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,373
but hold on,

110
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,803
just hold on.

111
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,573
- Don't worry.

112
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,783
I'll hold on.

113
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,120
- Glad to see you back home, Brock.

114
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,730
- Thank you, Mr. Norris.

115
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,410
Glad to be here.

116
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,911
Guess Tracy filled you in on the beef deal

117
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,448
with the railroad.

118
00:10:46,448 --> 00:10:48,320
- I think I'd let you
men give him the details.

119
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,910
- Stage will be in half an hour

120
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,743
we better get right to it.

121
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:52,780
- Now here's the way it cuts,

122
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,440
new track road runs nearest power places.

123
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,490
Nobody else can handle supply,

124
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,730
there will be plenty in
the contract for all of us.

125
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,700
- The road will want plenty
of beef for the men, grading,

126
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,907
digging, and laying the track.

127
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:05,630
- And Norris and me will
put in the supply joint deal

128
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,990
while they're building the
60 miles south of town.

129
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,690
- And you and Tracy run the supply

130
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,690
for 30 miles north of town.

131
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,430
It cuts to 130 each for
the 90 mile stretch.

132
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,320
- And where there's no cutthroat deals,

133
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,887
we don't drive the price up or down,

134
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,680
and we'll all get a fair
shake of the business.

135
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,040
Deal?

136
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,650
- What do you say, Brock?

137
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,130
- I say I couldn't have
made a better deal myself.

138
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,870
- Ah, I figured we could
settle it friendly,

139
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,340
like we used to with your dad.

140
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,730
- All right, we're all agreed.

141
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,610
Nothing to do now,

142
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,153
but sit here and wait for the
stage to bring Mr. Phelps.

143
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,840
- Is that the railroad agent?
- Yeah.

144
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,050
We see him together,

145
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,340
deal with him together.

146
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,400
There'll be no long woven.

147
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,690
- No one is gonna try
to cut anyone else out.

148
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,333
- Never hurts though to
have all things understood.

149
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,460
Roy, drinks for the boys.

150
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,040
- No thanks, Tracy and I have an errand.

151
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,210
We'll be back on the stage gets in.

152
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:58,043
- We'll be here.

153
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,230
- They didn't mean anything.

154
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,113
- Nobody means anything.

155
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,300
- You know how they are,

156
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,473
old timers, trusting the
good book and not much else.

157
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,660
Still play poker with two decks
and three guns on the table.

158
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,330
Anything they said wasn't meant personal.

159
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,620
- No, it wasn't meant personal for you.

160
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,460
(door shuts)

161
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,960
- Welcome home, Brock.

162
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,380
- Very glad to see you.
- Thank you.

163
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,240
- He looks pretty good,

164
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,450
doesn't he, Mr. Van Steeden.

165
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,333
- Brock, always look good to me.

166
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,166
Sit down.

167
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,080
Have a cigar, new shipment.
- No, thank you, sir.

168
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,610
- Half the people I know tell me

169
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,480
tobacco is good for the nerves.

170
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,263
The other half telling me it's bad.

171
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,570
Weight on both side.

172
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,530
I guess I know what's worrying you, boys,

173
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,200
worrying me a little too.

174
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,740
- Trace told me about the loan.

175
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,210
It was very kind of you, sir.

176
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,957
- Kindness had nothing to do with it.

177
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:22,490
I'm a banker using depositors' money.

178
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,233
Your land was good security.

179
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,420
Your note comes due in three days.

180
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,380
I put it the directors for an extension

181
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,109
in case you needed it.

182
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:34,283
The answer was no.

183
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:37,116
I think you'd be able to meet it.

184
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,620
- We'll know in about an hour.

185
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,620
- Railroad deal?

186
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,670
- The agents coming in
on the afternoon stage.

187
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,940
- Think you'll be able
to close the contract?

188
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,010
- Well, I hope so,

189
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,320
we're pooling with Norris
and Riley on the deal.

190
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,570
- Smart business.

191
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,673
- They're certain we'll have
the deal roped and tied.

192
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,430
- Even if you're able
to reach the agreement

193
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,070
with the agent tonight,

194
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,740
the contract will have to go to Washington

195
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,810
for final signature.

196
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:01,180
Now that'll take time more
than you've got to spare.

197
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,380
- Well, can you get the
bank directors to hold off

198
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,327
till the contract is signed?

199
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:06,920
- I'm getting strong
opposition to this note,

200
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,993
uncommonly strong.

201
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,213
Tell you what?

202
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,500
Try to get a letter or some
sort of written assurance

203
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,010
on the deal from the agent.

204
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:15,843
Bring it to me,

205
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:17,980
and I'll personally
assume the responsibility

206
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,530
to give you the extension.

207
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,090
- If anything happens, you
will be left holding the bag.

208
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,540
You were running that risk?

209
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,400
- That's what we're
really here for, Brock.

210
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,610
We passed by this way only once.

211
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,060
We get the chance to run the risk

212
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,740
for a different way of future
life for a boy we like,

213
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,440
we should be grateful to be
given that chance to help.

214
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,140
Anyway, you've had your fling,

215
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,500
I think you'll handle your
responsibilities like a man.

216
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,943
- Thanks for your confidence.

217
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,390
- There is one thing
you always should know.

218
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,640
Someone's pressing to buy
up your note for cash.

219
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,473
- Who?

220
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:56,333
- Chad Deasy.

221
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,240
He also happens to be on
the board of directors,

222
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,230
that's the opposition to the extension.

223
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,550
Now, you know what you're up against.

224
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,383
- Mm-hmm.

225
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,230
And you?

226
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,130
- I don't like it.

227
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,690
I don't like it because I
know what's pressing Deasy

228
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,520
and it isn't a legitimate business.

229
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,440
- You'd like nothing better

230
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,020
than to get the whip hand over me.

231
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,200
- There's nothing I'd like
less than to give it to him.

232
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,683
- Even by sticking your
own neck out to prevent it?

233
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,263
- Like I said,

234
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,263
we pass by this way only once.

235
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,323
Good luck.

236
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,193
- I dunno, Trace.

237
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,080
I have a feeling this isn't gonna work.

238
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,530
- What are you talking about?

239
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,190
- Chad Deasy, he isn't gonna let it rest.

240
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,803
He's gonna push to a showdown.

241
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,880
One way or another, Deasy is
gonna push me to a showdown.

242
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,860
- Listen, there's nothing he can do

243
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,810
unless you let him.

244
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,633
He's no gun,

245
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,210
so he isn't gonna force you to draw.

246
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,600
There's nothing he can do about our note

247
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,640
once the railroad agent gets here,

248
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,380
just sit tight.

249
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,213
Another couple of hours,

250
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:16,960
we'll be heading back to the ranch.

251
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,793
Sit tight.

252
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,400
- I heard you were in town, Mitchell.

253
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,603
In fact, I heard you were
heading this way two days ago,

254
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,940
and so I got me an imported
bodyguard from the COllins.

255
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,233
Meet Miley Sutton.

256
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,007
This is Brock Mitchell,

257
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:41,430
and he's got the reputation
of being the fastest gun

258
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,890
in the territory.

259
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,050
He'd rather gunfight than eat,

260
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,400
so that's what you may
have to come up against.

261
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,763
He likes to specialize in killing Deasys.

262
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,210
He's already gotten my brother Sim,

263
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,170
so watch him.

264
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,963
That's what I'm paying you for.

265
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,733
- Deasy.

266
00:16:57,733 --> 00:17:00,450
- Watch him like you'd watch a Sidewinder.

267
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,770
He's just as quick and just as tricky.

268
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,080
- I killed Sim in a fair fight.

269
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,890
After he'd killed a
drunken 20 year old kid

270
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,160
he bullied into drawing on him.

271
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,610
I've never heard you cry about that kid.

272
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,770
- I wasn't his brother.

273
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,180
The only thing that matters to me

274
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,990
is that Sim was my brother.

275
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,060
- Your brother dropped that kid

276
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,760
then turned his gun on me for no reason.

277
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,820
- No, you yelled,

278
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,850
he turned and you shot.

279
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,240
You wanted him to turn on you,

280
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,560
because of Ginny Clay.

281
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,393
- Brock?

282
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,993
- The next time he makes a move
like that gun him, you hear?

283
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,600
You're my body guard,

284
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,243
and you've got a right to
gun him down like a dog.

285
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,310
- Don't ever get between
me and a gun again.

286
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,743
- I had to.

287
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,157
That's Deasy's play from now on

288
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,233
to get you to draw against his hired gun.

289
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,790
I had to save your skinny chance for you.

290
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:06,312
(peaceful piano music)

291
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:10,610
- You had me thinking brothers.

292
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,203
Yeah, it looks like I
got the best of the deal.

293
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,813
- Hello Brock.

294
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:18,923
- Ginny.

295
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,942
- I heard you were back.

296
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:22,775
- Yes.

297
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,110
- Oh, this is Mr. Tom Williams.

298
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,740
Tracy and Brock Mitchell.

299
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,520
- Brock Mitchel?

300
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,567
- How do you do you do?

301
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,617
- How do you do, sir?

302
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:34,207
- Well.

303
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:36,722
- Well?

304
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:39,260
- You're looking very well, Brock.

305
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,093
- Thank you.

306
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,800
You look wonderful.

307
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,633
- Thank you.

308
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:46,030
- How have you been?
- Oh fine Brock, just fine.

309
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,863
- That's good.

310
00:18:46,863 --> 00:18:48,639
Do you spend-
- Do you spend-

311
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:51,639
(suspenseful music)

312
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,783
Well, bye Brock.

313
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,978
Nice seeing you again.

314
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:01,399
- Goodbye Ginny.

315
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:04,399
(suspenseful music)

316
00:19:12,463 --> 00:19:15,980
- I was just thinking
maybe after we get settled,

317
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,530
there is no reason why you
shouldn't you and Ginny.

318
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:22,630
- The way her father feels
about me, I don't know.

319
00:19:24,047 --> 00:19:25,214
(dogs barking)

320
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:26,567
I don't know.

321
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,544
- Here she comes.

322
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:28,461
This is it!

323
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:33,233
(jolly suspenseful music)

324
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:36,150
(horses galloping)

325
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,903
(dogs barking)

326
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,823
- Mr. Phelps.

327
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,853
- What?

328
00:19:53,853 --> 00:19:55,810
- Are you Mr. Phelps, from Washington?

329
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,643
- No.

330
00:19:57,924 --> 00:19:58,800
- Alabam.

331
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,633
- Hi Tracy,

332
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,140
- You carry a passenger name of Phelps

333
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,560
coming on from Washington,

334
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,700
making connections with
your coach at Gunstock.

335
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,193
- Phelps, Washington?

336
00:20:07,193 --> 00:20:08,400
- A railroad man.

337
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,610
- Oh yeah, that's the fellow.

338
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,600
- Did you see him?

339
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,060
- Yep.

340
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,230
Gunstock.
- He was supposed

341
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:14,640
to ride in with you.

342
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,070
- That's right.

343
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,090
- Where is he?

344
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,120
- Like I said Gunstock.
- And did you speak to him?

345
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:20,953
- Yep.

346
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:21,940
- Why did he say?

347
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,500
- Staying on at Gunstock.
- Is that all?

348
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,770
- Nope, he said had some
business to attend to there.

349
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,120
- He sent a message?

350
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,480
- To who?

351
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,833
- Them, Trace.

352
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,420
- No message, except he had
to stay over for business.

353
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,610
- Yeah, well, nothing we can do about it.

354
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,747
We just have to wait for him.

355
00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:42,130
- You think there's any doubt
about them coming through.

356
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,523
- No, I don't think so.

357
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,800
More than likely he'll be
here by tomorrow stage.

358
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,210
Well, might as well get
ourselves a couple of rooms

359
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,260
at the hotel.

360
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,920
- You figured to stay
over in town for tonight.

361
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,590
- Too hard to ride back at the ranch,

362
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,190
and back to town again tomorrow.

363
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,080
- Well, maybe Brock and I
will go back to our place.

364
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,010
- Might be better for you
and Brock to stay on in town

365
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,170
where we can see you.

366
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,060
It might be a good idea to talk some more

367
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,563
about the deal after dinner.

368
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,620
- Yeah, we'll stay here,

369
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,440
where you can see me.

370
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,273
- Fair enough.

371
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:17,050
- I think we've gotta stroll
down the hotel and register.

372
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,710
- There isn't anything else we can do?

373
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,543
Let's check in.

374
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:34,052
(jolly piano music)

375
00:21:46,395 --> 00:21:48,200
Whiskey.
- Yeah.

376
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,940
- I repeat it's the end of any town

377
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,770
when it lets killers roam it's streets,

378
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,270
and peaceful citizens
have to hire bodyguards

379
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,633
to protect themselves.

380
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,090
No, man is safe.

381
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,200
Well, women and children.

382
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,363
If we permit gunfighters to
come and go as they please.

383
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,013
- Let's go.
- Finish your drink.

384
00:22:12,236 --> 00:22:13,690
- How about some Chinese
food across the street?

385
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,273
- No, we'll have our drinks
and dinner here, right here.

386
00:22:16,273 --> 00:22:18,540
- [Chad] I don't know what
that sheriff was thinking of.

387
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,210
If he's afraid of gunfighters,

388
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,653
can't handle the situation let him say so.

389
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,120
Plenty of men in this town are
ready to protect their own.

390
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,963
- Mr. Mitchell.

391
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,563
Mr. Mitchell, good evening?

392
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,530
- Yeah, good evening.
- I just, well,

393
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,000
I want you to know that I-
- What's on your mind?

394
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,210
- Ms. Ginny Clay, sir.

395
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,760
She doesn't mean anything.

396
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,180
I mean, I don't mean anything to her, sir.

397
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,013
- What?

398
00:22:47,013 --> 00:22:49,520
- Well, I just happened to be out there.

399
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,900
I promised her father I'd see

400
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,190
that she got home all right, sir,

401
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,375
and I want you to know that I
didn't mean to cut in on you.

402
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,510
- What are you trying to say?

403
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,990
- I promise I'll never see her again,

404
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,720
and I want to apologize to you, sir.

405
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,690
- No, that you don't have to,

406
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,030
it doesn't mean anything to me.

407
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,066
- I'm sorry, I never-

408
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:04,470
- I not gonna hurt you.

409
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,923
- You are, you are.

410
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,195
- Don't ever talk to me like that again.

411
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:10,028
Don't ever come begging
to me, you hear me?

412
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,503
- Please sir, I'll never
see her again I promise.

413
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,796
- Mad dog killer.

414
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:23,796
(people chattering)

415
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:32,124
(suspenseful music)

416
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,603
- No lights.

417
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,623
I'm afraid, Tracy.
- Afraid of what?

418
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,783
- Myself.

419
00:23:54,098 --> 00:23:55,948
I'm afraid of what's happening to me.

420
00:23:57,513 --> 00:23:59,087
I'm thinking wrong.

421
00:23:59,087 --> 00:23:59,920
- Brock.

422
00:24:02,726 --> 00:24:03,893
I'm listening.

423
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,700
- I'm beginning to
think everyone hates me,

424
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,923
plotting against me,

425
00:24:08,764 --> 00:24:10,430
and they think I have
no friend but my gun.

426
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,440
- There's me and Van Steeden.

427
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,740
I think there's Ginny too.

428
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,900
- Yeah.

429
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,460
You remember that summer when you, Ginny,

430
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,343
and I were playing at the Creek?

431
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:24,250
Well, maybe hip high and you ran away,

432
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,260
and got lost in the foot hills.

433
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,360
- Two days and nights,

434
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,575
and you didn't sleep till I was found.

435
00:24:30,575 --> 00:24:32,200
- Yeah.

436
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,090
You tried to tell me
then what it was like,

437
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,990
being out there alone in the nights.

438
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,103
You tried to tell me what
that dark alone feeling.

439
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,840
and the lost feeling was like.

440
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,270
I thought I knew what you were saying,

441
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,133
but I didn't,

442
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,819
I didn't know it all.

443
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:58,053
I know now I can't find a road, Trace.

444
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,380
I wanna come back to people.

445
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:04,230
I wanna open up my arms up to them.

446
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,993
I want them to take my
hand when I hold it out,

447
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:09,461
not look for the gun in it.

448
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:13,310
I want people to look at me
again with that warm feeling

449
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:14,143
that I belong.

450
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,223
Yeah, that I belong.

451
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,953
(somber piano music)

452
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,427
I do belong.

453
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,170
(piano music)

454
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,870
- I'll run over and tell Van Steeden

455
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,550
Mr. Phelps would be in town today.

456
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,163
Meet you at the Queen.
- Okay.

457
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,163
- Mr. Mitchell, why did you do it?

458
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,520
- Ma'am?

459
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,890
- Driving my boy out of town,

460
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,730
beating him, and threatening him.

461
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,563
- Your boy?

462
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,473
- Only a boy.

463
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,573
Only 20 years old.

464
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,143
Told him you'd gun him down
if he didn't leave town.

465
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,518
You warned him not to see that girl again.

466
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:21,140
- No.

467
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,901
No, it isn't true.

468
00:26:22,901 --> 00:26:25,277
- How could you do such a thing?

469
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:30,573
- Ginny?

470
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,487
Please listen to me.

471
00:26:34,487 --> 00:26:36,626
- Let me pass.
- I swear it isn't true.

472
00:26:36,626 --> 00:26:37,760
- I thought it was all just talk

473
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,330
until I heard Mrs. Williams version.

474
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,640
- No, it didn't happen like that.

475
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,580
- You threatened him.
- That's a lie.

476
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,640
- Everybody there heard it.

477
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,210
- I was only trying to help.

478
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,403
- You come as a client or as a gun?

479
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,149
But you finally found
me without a bodyguard.

480
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:28,350
You know, I never carry a gun,

481
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,666
so it should be easy for you.

482
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:32,330
- You know you don't need a bodyguard.

483
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,070
We both know why you're doing this.

484
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,030
- Doing what?

485
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,700
- You're playing a tight game,

486
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,003
close to the vest.

487
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,810
But you might've make one
raise too much and be cold.

488
00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:48,850
You know a man can only be
pushed and baited so far.

489
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:51,413
- Call me, that's what I'm counting on.

490
00:27:51,413 --> 00:27:53,070
- He's in the business
last night with a kid

491
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,490
at the Mountain Queen,

492
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,413
now I'm down in the
street with his mother.

493
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,308
- You know I don't think
it's all just happened

494
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:00,477
out with the blue.

495
00:28:00,477 --> 00:28:04,471
- And that's where you are
fishing out in the blue.

496
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:06,700
You're spinning, you're reeling.

497
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,730
You're dizzy, Mitchell.

498
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,823
You're losing your grip and you know it,

499
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,490
that's the difference between us.

500
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,233
I know how to wait it out, you don't.

501
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,400
- Yeah, and that's the
risk you're running.

502
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,860
- Let me lay it out for you.

503
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,393
You killed my brother,

504
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,360
before I'm through with you,

505
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,310
you'd wish it was the other way around.

506
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,820
I'm going to make you a mop

507
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,650
for every trigger, happy punk.

508
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,730
I'm gonna push you off
the land, out of town,

509
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,563
into the saddle,

510
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:42,513
onto the trail with nothing
but your roll and gun.

511
00:28:43,356 --> 00:28:45,870
There won't be a town of a
thousand miles where the sheriff

512
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,970
won't be waiting for,.

513
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,750
Won't be at town and a thousand miles

514
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,690
where you'll be able to rest your head.

515
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,060
- I've learned to take
the shots as they come.

516
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:59,230
- Saddle bum, just rolling and rolling

517
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,740
till you reach that spot

518
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,143
where the faster shot is waiting for you,

519
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,373
and you catch that final
bullet between the eyes.

520
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,453
That's the way it's going to
be and nothing can stop me.

521
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,860
Only one thing worries
me that you go quietly

522
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,513
into some dark corner right now,

523
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:22,990
and put a bullet in your head

524
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,090
to save yourself all
that grief and misery.

525
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,983
That's the one thing I
can't stop you from doing.

526
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,570
- I know Deasy,

527
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,970
you figure you've got a
legitimate burn against me.

528
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,790
All right, but by trying
to drive me off the ranch

529
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,950
you're hurting an
innocent kid, my brother.

530
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,610
There was another innocent kid

531
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,060
who was hurt.

532
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,763
He happened to be my brother,

533
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,407
but I'll make a deal with you,

534
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,883
I'll leave Tracy be,

535
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,343
even see that he gets a year's
extension on his bank note.

536
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:58,790
All you got to do is to sign this,

537
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,050
and get out of town.

538
00:30:02,362 --> 00:30:05,450
Very simple as to clear
and clean admission

539
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,823
that you killed Sim,

540
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,970
deliberately, 'cause you were jealous.

541
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,093
After you'd warned him to
stay away from Ginny Clay.

542
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:14,883
- Hold it.

543
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,523
Raise them.

544
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,183
Raise.

545
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,262
What do we do with them, Mr. Deasy?

546
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:30,280
- It looks like we got
everything in our hands now,

547
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,113
doesn't it?

548
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,490
Notorious gunfighter, half
the town saw him come up

549
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,750
to the office of the man

550
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,020
who's brother he gunned.

551
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,150
He put the gun to me,

552
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,593
but just in time my bodyguard.

553
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,683
Yeah, he's a lawyer.

554
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,100
My professional opinion,

555
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,813
I'd say that was self-defense,

556
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,250
clean and clear.

557
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,900
Wouldn't you, Sutton?

558
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,620
- Anything you say, Mr. Deasy.

559
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,900
- Yes, I think that would
hold it up in any court.

560
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,910
Of course I had other plans for Mitchell,

561
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,213
but this sure is one way
of a little bit temptation.

562
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,140
What do you say, Sutton?

563
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:15,150
- Well, no telling how long
did it drag on otherwise?

564
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:17,250
And I got a job waiting for me in Durango.

565
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,210
All right, fella, pick it up.

566
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:33,120
- Making you look good for the law, huh?

567
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,740
- No hard feelings.

568
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,063
Just another job to me.

569
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,217
But pick it up or I'll club you blind.

570
00:31:39,217 --> 00:31:42,058
(Gun fires)
(punch thuds)

571
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:42,891
- Hold it.

572
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:52,700
(window crushes)

573
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,380
Now, there're a dozen witnesses down there

574
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,190
that will swear that they
saw my gun fly out the window

575
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,073
after one shot,

576
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,670
and they'll find that bullet in the wall.

577
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:06,493
Shoot now and they'll know you
did it when I was in armed.

578
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,763
- Maybe another time, Mitchell.

579
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,373
Another place.

580
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,073
- Yeah.

581
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,240
Yeah, I'm afraid you're right.

582
00:32:55,915 --> 00:32:56,873
- You're all right, you didn't?

583
00:32:56,873 --> 00:32:58,790
- No, nothing happened.

584
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,613
- I was just coming out of the bank

585
00:33:00,613 --> 00:33:03,220
when I heard the shot then
your gun came sailing out.

586
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,053
What happened?

587
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,593
- Anybody hurt up there?

588
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,503
- No.

589
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
- Come to my office.

590
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,370
All right, what happened?

591
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:36,203
- [Brock] Oh, Sutton Drew,

592
00:33:36,203 --> 00:33:38,496
and I knocked the gun out of his hand.

593
00:33:38,496 --> 00:33:40,288
The shot went wild.

594
00:33:40,288 --> 00:33:41,121
- Then what?

595
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:43,340
- Then I threw my gun out the window.

596
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,360
That's the way it happened.

597
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,510
- You have trouble, Mitchell.

598
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,330
Ever since you came back
nothing but trouble.

599
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:48,460
- Yeah, but I'm not asking for.

600
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,220
- Just seems to grow
around you like wheat.

601
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,423
Well, last night,

602
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,740
you had threatened young Tom Williams,

603
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,810
scared him out of town.

604
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,360
A whole bar room full
of people saw you do it.

605
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,143
We both know the reason why.

606
00:34:04,296 --> 00:34:05,450
- You put me in a tough spot,

607
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,530
and I'm trying hard to
think only as it's sheriff.

608
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,990
I think of what's good for this town.

609
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,953
I got a lot of reasons I'm
trying to keep out of my mind.

610
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,573
Yeah.

611
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,177
We know what those reasons are.

612
00:34:21,942 --> 00:34:24,763
That's why I'm bending over
backwards trying to be fair.

613
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,200
But just one more thing, Mitchell,

614
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,973
just one more thing.

615
00:34:37,234 --> 00:34:40,550
(suspenseful music)

616
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,383
- Anything else?

617
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:48,738
(suspenseful music)

618
00:34:54,286 --> 00:34:55,703
- Brock's trying.

619
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,560
He's trying real hard to settle down.

620
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,103
He needs help.

621
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:06,393
(suspenseful music)

622
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:13,797
(jolly music)

623
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,768
(dogs barking)

624
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:44,828
(suspenseful music)

625
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:00,760
He didn't show?
- No.

626
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,887
- Alabama, you see Mr. Phelps in Gunstock?

627
00:36:01,887 --> 00:36:03,620
- Nope.
- Did he say anything?

628
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,453
- Nope.

629
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,868
Probably just held over on
railroad business there.

630
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:13,371
He'll be here tomorrow for sure.

631
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:14,510
- We haven't much time, Trace.

632
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,910
- We just wait it out.

633
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,717
- Maybe one of us ought
to ride over to Gunstock.

634
00:36:18,717 --> 00:36:20,120
- That's a good idea.

635
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,300
It's a hard ride,

636
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,410
but Brock can make it there
and back by nightfall.

637
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,960
- Well, I don't know.

638
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,793
- Why not?

639
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:28,320
Let's find out how we
stand with Mr. Phelps.

640
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,800
- Might not look too good
to push him like that.

641
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,633
- That's right.

642
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:32,690
You think we're all so anxious

643
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,150
likely to drive our price down,

644
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:34,983
right Norris?

645
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:35,816
- That's the way I figured.

646
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:37,610
- Look, our notes due at
the bank tomorrow night.

647
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,840
- Then let's wait till tomorrow night.

648
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,380
- We have to know where we stand.

649
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,103
It makes sense to me to ride
out a Gunstock and find out.

650
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,680
You don't trust me.

651
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,780
- It isn't a question of trust.

652
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,613
We're in this together

653
00:36:49,613 --> 00:36:51,360
and agreed there'd be no lone wolfing.

654
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,800
- Anybody could ride who wants you.

655
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,997
- No, you don't go to
Seatumbs and Gunstock.

656
00:36:57,554 --> 00:36:58,800
- I don't see how I can be stopped.

657
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,703
- You'll go and Norris and me
pull out of the deal with you.

658
00:37:02,732 --> 00:37:05,070
Your ranch can handle the contract alone.

659
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,190
And we train Norris and me,

660
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,920
we might be able to make
the stretch for service

661
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,880
in the road,

662
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,943
so make up your mind.

663
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,423
- Let Trace go.

664
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,730
- No, this kind of deal
wouldn't look right

665
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,980
to send a kid like Tracy.

666
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:21,592
- You better keep your
brother in line, Tracy.

667
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,980
We like you, but he's trouble.

668
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,253
Just keep him in line.

669
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,083
- Brock?

670
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,520
- Don't worry, Trace.

671
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,920
I'll stay.

672
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,716
I won't cause you any more trouble.

673
00:37:44,716 --> 00:37:47,383
(ambient music)

674
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:08,579
(horse neighs)

675
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:19,230
Hey, it doesn't seem too
long ago that you, Trace,

676
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,330
and I used to-

677
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,743
- Yes, seems like only yesterday.

678
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,410
A lot of water's trend
down this Creek fit.

679
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,200
- [Brock] Where did it all go gone?

680
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,700
- Gone, I thought.

681
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:35,403
- [Brock] Yeah, a lot has
happened to both of us.

682
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,220
- I'd rather not talk about it, Brock.

683
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,870
- Maybe talking about it will help us find

684
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,883
where it all went.

685
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,507
- [Ginny] Will it?

686
00:38:43,507 --> 00:38:46,483
- It was good between us once, very good.

687
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,103
- Brock?
- Yes, Ginny.

688
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,953
- A river can't run the other way, ever.

689
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,240
- Maybe that's what I'm
trying to do with my life,

690
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,690
run he river backwards.

691
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,140
But ever since I've
trouble with Sim Deasy,

692
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,920
the river just seemed to pick me up,

693
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,450
and roll me away.

694
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,300
No, time to swim, fight, or even breathe.

695
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,360
You know, it doesn't seem possible

696
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,820
that a feeling between two
people could stopped cold

697
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,053
than the time it takes
a bullet to leave a gun.

698
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,340
- Do you think it's been easy for me?

699
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,280
- [Brock] Then why all this?

700
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,210
- You know why.

701
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,130
- No, Ginny, all I know is
that without ever see me again,

702
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,500
you believe what you were told

703
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,880
that I killed a man deliberately.

704
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,180
- [Ginny] Well, you forced me
to believe it, you went away.

705
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,687
- Look, I had never killed a man before.

706
00:39:28,687 --> 00:39:30,687
And that night when you wouldn't see me,

707
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,170
you could've stopped me, Ginny.

708
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,417
All you had to say was,
"I stand with Brock,"

709
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:38,067
but no, you turned the other way,

710
00:39:41,165 --> 00:39:42,610
- Please Brock.

711
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:43,443
I...

712
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,023
- Ginny.

713
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,370
All right, it's done.

714
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,420
I don't wanna hurt you or myself

715
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,290
trying to roll the river back.

716
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,293
Just one thing,

717
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,400
I was forced to shoot Sim Deasy,

718
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,136
and I never threatened Tom Williams.

719
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:03,151
Do you believe me?

720
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:06,151
(suspenseful music)

721
00:40:16,856 --> 00:40:19,523
(horse gallops)

722
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,110
- Anytime that hot shot once
wants to slow down with me,

723
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,610
he knows where he can find me.

724
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,440
I'd even give him the draw.

725
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:41,600
Well, there's the big man now.

726
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,650
And what do you know?

727
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,293
Look, man, no guns.

728
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:50,163
A gunless gunfighter like
gunless gutless wonder.

729
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,490
- Brock, we better go.

730
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,720
- No.

731
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,651
- Pretty tricky, you know.

732
00:40:56,651 --> 00:40:59,020
Now where do you think he hides his guns?

733
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,983
Under his hat?

734
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:05,483
Maybe he's got some sort
of new weapons, huh?

735
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,213
Hey you!

736
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,027
I mean you, gunless.

737
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:27,877
You got some kind of new weapon, huh?

738
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,820
Name it.

739
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,643
I'll meet you with anything you call,

740
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,273
even feather pillows at 10 paces.

741
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,593
Well, it's better pillars,

742
00:41:38,593 --> 00:41:40,820
you're gonna have to give me a break.

743
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,070
Let me throw mine, first.

744
00:41:46,187 --> 00:41:47,720
No wonder of the age.

745
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,543
The gunless gutless wonder.

746
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,543
Scares women and children out of town.

747
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,853
Oh now, I hurt his feelings.

748
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:58,910
I ain't been fair.

749
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,133
All right, gutless, reach for it.

750
00:42:16,865 --> 00:42:17,698
Reach.

751
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,283
(Sutton blows)

752
00:42:39,346 --> 00:42:42,346
(people chattering)

753
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,019
(gun fires)

754
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:04,519
(punch thuds)

755
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,517
(punches thudding)

756
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:45,177
(bottle shattering)

757
00:43:45,177 --> 00:43:46,510
- [Man] Come on!

758
00:44:13,125 --> 00:44:13,958
- Brock!

759
00:44:16,982 --> 00:44:19,482
(punch thuds)

760
00:44:26,117 --> 00:44:28,117
- [Man] Just get up now!

761
00:44:29,006 --> 00:44:30,114
- Brock, stop it!

762
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:32,697
(horse neighs)

763
00:44:53,931 --> 00:44:55,181
Brock, stop it!

764
00:44:57,468 --> 00:44:58,301
Stop!

765
00:45:11,305 --> 00:45:12,138
You...

766
00:45:15,786 --> 00:45:16,703
all of you.

767
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,484
You did this to him,

768
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:23,763
pushing him.

769
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,333
Baiting him.

770
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,360
Sniffing at him like an animal.

771
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,190
Making an animal of them.

772
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,010
All he wanted was to...

773
00:45:40,932 --> 00:45:42,849
all he wanted was to...

774
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,320
- [Brock] Is he dead?

775
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,153
- No.

776
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,893
- I wanted him dead.

777
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,793
It's no good, Trace,

778
00:46:08,437 --> 00:46:10,783
a killer, an animal.

779
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:14,030
I'm like an animal.

780
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:14,880
- No, you're not.

781
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:16,993
They're right.

782
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,210
So many people they must be right.

783
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:23,710
- No, don't let them be right.

784
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,763
- I couldn't stop.

785
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,713
I wanted to sink my teeth into his throat.

786
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:36,543
Clay is right,

787
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:38,563
I am trouble.

788
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:41,473
It grows around me like weeds,

789
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,393
every one I touch.

790
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,390
I shouldn't have come back.

791
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,699
I'm leaving.

792
00:46:52,699 --> 00:46:55,782
(somber piano music)

793
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,200
- All right, you leave again.

794
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,553
but not without me.

795
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:05,540
You think I tried to keep
the ranch going for myself,

796
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,983
I don't want it without you.

797
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:11,626
I don't want any part of
that loneliness anymore.

798
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:15,903
You hit the trail,

799
00:47:15,903 --> 00:47:16,997
I hit it with you.

800
00:47:18,246 --> 00:47:21,196
You live in the saddle, the
saddle boom I live it with you.

801
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,730
You can't run away from it anymore, Brock.

802
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,103
I'm tired of holding the fort by myself.

803
00:47:30,392 --> 00:47:34,090
(suspenseful music)

804
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:35,680
- Fix my face.

805
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,080
I can't look like this
when Phelps gets to town.

806
00:47:43,793 --> 00:47:44,626
Hey, easy!

807
00:47:54,511 --> 00:47:57,261
(sheep bleating)

808
00:48:02,143 --> 00:48:03,110
- Howdy?

809
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:03,943
- Morning.

810
00:48:03,943 --> 00:48:05,060
- You come the price I'm cuttings.

811
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,720
- No.
- No?

812
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,630
I don't know where them clothes
are supposed to come from.

813
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:09,540
You sure you aint a fellow named McCots?

814
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,980
- No, I'm look-
- No, funny.

815
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,830
We've been waiting for this fella to,

816
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:17,256
are you sure you aint
a fella named McCots.

817
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:18,687
- Listen, I'm sure I'm
not a fella named McCots,

818
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,300
and I didn't come for the cutting.

819
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:21,440
I'm looking for Mrs. Williams,

820
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,414
is she around?
- Yeah, she's up by the barn.

821
00:48:24,414 --> 00:48:25,247
- Thanks.

822
00:48:27,548 --> 00:48:32,331
- I sure don't know what we're
gonna do with them cuttings.

823
00:48:32,331 --> 00:48:33,817
(sheep bleating)

824
00:48:33,817 --> 00:48:36,400
(dogs barking)

825
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,583
- Morning.

826
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,233
- Your face, how?

827
00:48:44,233 --> 00:48:45,066
- I guess it's all part of what happened

828
00:48:45,066 --> 00:48:46,423
between us yesterday.

829
00:48:49,918 --> 00:48:50,921
- I don't understand.

830
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:53,770
- People accusing me of
running people out of town.

831
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:56,120
Mrs. Williams, you know I
didn't threaten your boy.

832
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,890
Now if he left town
there was another reason.

833
00:48:58,890 --> 00:48:59,850
- I'm sorry, Mr. Mitchell.

834
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,570
I'm very busy just now and.

835
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,735
- Mrs. Williams, I must talk to you.

836
00:49:03,735 --> 00:49:06,260
I don't think you realize
how important this is to me.

837
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,550
- I've got nothing to talk
to you about, nothing.

838
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,678
I didn't ask you to come here,

839
00:49:09,678 --> 00:49:10,763
and I want you to go.

840
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,463
Please, just go away.

841
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,030
- I think I understand how you feel.

842
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:21,360
Sometimes they're forced to
do things one way or another,

843
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,760
that we're ashamed of later.

844
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:25,810
It isn't easy to speak the truth

845
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:27,410
once the lie starts,

846
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:30,160
one lie leads to another until
we get in deeper and deeper,

847
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,840
and well it looks like
there's no other way,

848
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,540
but to go on with it,

849
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:36,250
no matter who it hurts,

850
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,800
that's what's happening to you.

851
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,120
- I've got problems enough on my own.

852
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,490
Gotta get on with my work.

853
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,540
Got a living to make.

854
00:49:44,454 --> 00:49:45,854
- And I have a life to make.

855
00:49:48,661 --> 00:49:51,744
(Mrs. Williams sobs)

856
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:56,150
I'm sorry, I better be going.

857
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,780
- Oh, forgive me.

858
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,080
Please, forgive me.

859
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,030
- It was Deasy, wasn't it?

860
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,360
- Yeah, he came to town and
said he tear up the notes

861
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:06,630
if we would, (sobs) we would.

862
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,453
- I don't blame you Mrs. Williams.

863
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,840
I know what Chad Deasy can do.

864
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,640
- I begged Tom not to do it,

865
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,280
but he wouldn't listen.

866
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,290
Said we were in deep
trouble about those notes,

867
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,933
and he meant well.

868
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,530
- Mrs Williams, thank you.

869
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,340
It took a lot of curries to tell me this.

870
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,790
I only wish I could help you.

871
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:29,280
There is one thing I can do though,

872
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,373
keep this quiet.

873
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,890
I don't care much what people think now,

874
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:34,020
except one person.

875
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,680
I'd like you to tell her the truth.

876
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,840
- Just tell me what you want me to do.

877
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,673
- Thank you.

878
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:40,099
I'll be back.

879
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:45,099
(horse galloping)
(dog barks)

880
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:18,868
(Brock knocks)

881
00:51:22,393 --> 00:51:25,300
(door opens)

882
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,173
Hello, Ginny.

883
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:28,263
- Your face?

884
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:30,730
- Yeah.

885
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:32,950
Ginny, I know how you feel about me.

886
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,920
- Please Brock, there's
no use talking about it.

887
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,023
- I don't intend to.

888
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:39,910
But there's one thing
that's very important to me.

889
00:51:45,118 --> 00:51:46,200
- What is it Brock?

890
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,033
- Ride with me,

891
00:51:47,033 --> 00:51:48,530
it won't take long.

892
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:50,980
after that I promise I
won't trouble you anymore.

893
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,453
- Wait for me.

894
00:51:57,265 --> 00:52:00,265
(suspenseful music)

895
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,040
- And Chad Deasy, he said
he'd tear up the note

896
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,263
if Tom would leave town.

897
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,290
I hate to admit it,

898
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,390
but I finally agreed,

899
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:17,320
and promised Mr. Deasy I'd
make a scene on the street

900
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,663
to embarrass Mr. Mitchell.

901
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,763
You never threatened Tom, I know that.

902
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,573
I just wish I hadn't let myself to.

903
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,163
Please forgive me.

904
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:34,109
- Thank you Mrs. Williams.

905
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,442
(peaceful guitar music)

906
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,470
Well, that's about it.

907
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:46,453
I just want you to know.

908
00:52:47,735 --> 00:52:50,735
(suspenseful music)

909
00:53:20,552 --> 00:53:21,960
- What'd you run off
to while I was asleep?

910
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,100
You've been gone almost all day.

911
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,880
- I had to find out something.

912
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,460
It's all right now.

913
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,063
- I see the stage got in early.

914
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,453
Phelps didn't show. huh?

915
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,107
- Let's go see Van Steeden now,

916
00:53:34,107 --> 00:53:36,458
maybe he can come up with an idea.

917
00:53:36,458 --> 00:53:37,458
- All right.

918
00:53:40,866 --> 00:53:41,920
- The stages in.
- I heard.

919
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,510
- Mo railroad agent.

920
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,770
- I also heard.

921
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:45,630
- Is that all you have to say?

922
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:47,170
- You come to my office,

923
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:48,330
I didn't come to yours.

924
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,260
- Oh, there's no reason for us
to play cute with each other.

925
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,500
Mitchell can pick up his note,

926
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,030
and his chances of getting
the money are very, very slim.

927
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:57,260
- That's the bank's business.

928
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,620
- And the depositors of which I happen

929
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,593
to be one of the largest and a director.

930
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,600
- Well, you should have
bought my offer, Mitchell.

931
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,700
At least you've done for your kid brother.

932
00:54:09,676 --> 00:54:11,590
Very well, headstrong,

933
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,680
Always too late for the headstrong.

934
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,920
- Mitchell's note is
mot due until sundown.

935
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,700
Tell them there's nothing to talk about.

936
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,530
How then you'll have to, excuse me.

937
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,580
These gentlemen are waiting to see me.

938
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,010
- It doesn't take much in these parts

939
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,010
to be called a gentlemen,

940
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:27,200
even if you're a bankrupt.

941
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,890
Oh, well I guess I can wait till tonight.

942
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,093
I'm a patient, man.

943
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:34,603
If I have to, I can even wait
till there's a new banker.

944
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,880
I'll see you after
business hours, tonight.

945
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,570
- It's like my trouble wits are beginning

946
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,740
to trip you up too.

947
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,263
- I can handle myself.

948
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:48,160
- That'd be a good thing
, Brock, for the community

949
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,590
if someone can finally handle Deasy.

950
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:52,923
No, no, no, don't be getting any ideas.

951
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:55,390
- No worries, sir, I'm past that.

952
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:57,340
- I shouldn't have said that, but that,

953
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,483
well boys, it doesn't look too good.

954
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,200
You just saw for yourselves
what I'm up against.

955
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,440
If you can't get some assurance

956
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,203
on that railroad contract
by sundown, we're late.

957
00:55:10,232 --> 00:55:12,940
Now one of you better hustle
up the Gunstock and see Phelps.

958
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,260
- You know how Norris and
Riley feel about that.

959
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,170
If they pull out on us,

960
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:18,420
well, we haven't got any chance at all.

961
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:22,320
- None, unless somebody
gets a note from Phelps,

962
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:27,320
and now I think Tracy and I see things

963
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,023
even clearer than you
what this thing means.

964
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,650
It isn't just saving the land.

965
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:36,840
It isn't just foreclosing
on a piece of property.

966
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,063
It's foreclosing on a man's life.

967
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,750
- It isn't easy to join
the human race again.

968
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,720
Once you've been drummed out, we'll try.

969
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:04,110
- You rode out of town this morning.

970
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,100
- I didn't ride to Gunstock
if that's what you mean.

971
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,200
- No, now let's not fly off the handle.

972
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:09,700
We're all under a strain.

973
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:10,867
Riley didn't mean nothing.

974
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,790
- You only made that nothing pretty plain.

975
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:14,680
- Sit down and talk this out.

976
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,830
No profit for anyone
yapping at each other.

977
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,140
- All right, let's put it on the line.

978
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:22,143
You men don't trust me,

979
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:24,710
but you know and respect, trace.

980
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:25,640
- That's for sure.

981
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,130
- Well, this beef deal means more to Trace

982
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,260
than it does to me.
- To us.

983
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,920
- Our bank note's due tonight.

984
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,400
If one of us doesn't get
to Phillips before that

985
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,160
then Tracy's lost his ranch,

986
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,070
and he's gambling everything on this deal.

987
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,100
- And Brock's gambling more
than a hunk of property.

988
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,860
You both know that.

989
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,770
- Go on, we're listening.

990
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:43,817
- You men can sit and wait out,

991
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:44,920
but we can't.

992
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,210
Let Trace ride the Gunstock.

993
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:47,920
He can make it there and back by then.

994
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,540
He can see Phelps and get a note from him,

995
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,203
and we'll catch you in
for a piece of our share.

996
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,780
- Okay, Trace,
- Whatever you say, Brock.

997
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:57,110
- Agreed?

998
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:59,630
- Where will you be while
Tracy's up to Gunstock?

999
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:01,680
- Where you can both see me every minute.

1000
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:08,270
- Agreed, and share Stan pack.

1001
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:09,103
- Agreed.

1002
00:57:10,456 --> 00:57:11,656
- We better get priding.

1003
00:57:12,594 --> 00:57:13,623
- Where are you going?

1004
00:57:13,623 --> 00:57:15,510
- To help Trace saddle up.

1005
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:17,030
- He's a big boy.

1006
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:18,250
- You just stay with us, Brock

1007
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,840
till Tracy gets back to town,

1008
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,340
that way you won't get lonely.

1009
00:57:22,984 --> 00:57:24,334
- Order yourself some food.

1010
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,160
He went off without
breakfast this morning.

1011
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:32,027
- I don't know what you mean.

1012
00:57:44,465 --> 00:57:49,465
(tense music)
(horse galloping)

1013
00:59:24,597 --> 00:59:25,520
- Mr. Phelps?

1014
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,353
- Yes.

1015
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,570
What can I do for you?

1016
00:59:30,031 --> 00:59:31,255
- I'd like to talk to you, sir?

1017
00:59:31,255 --> 00:59:33,910
- (laughs) Sure, sit down here.

1018
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:34,787
- Thank you, sir.

1019
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:36,910
- Something to drink?

1020
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,370
- No, thank you, sir.

1021
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:39,970
I'm Tracey Mitchell, Mr. Phelps.

1022
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:42,341
- Mitchell?
- From showdown Creek.

1023
00:59:42,341 --> 00:59:44,900
- Well, I haven't seen in
the past, Mr. Mitchell,

1024
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,290
I'd expected you to be
well, a little older.

1025
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,760
- Well, the boss of our
ranch is my brother, Brock.

1026
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,880
He's older and very dependable.

1027
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:53,600
- Yes, I'm sure.

1028
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,670
Well, son, I'm glad you got here sooner,

1029
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:57,740
Norris and Riley with you?

1030
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:58,800
- Sooner?

1031
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,440
- Well, I didn't expect you
until the last day of the week.

1032
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,380
I didn't mind waiting though

1033
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:04,080
since I had business here in Gunstock.

1034
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,390
That it was very thoughtful of you men

1035
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,937
to save me the trip to Showdown Creek.

1036
01:00:08,937 --> 01:00:10,890
- But we've been waiting for you, sir.

1037
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:13,213
- Waiting for me?
- In Showdown Creek.

1038
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,090
- For how long?
- Three days now, sir.

1039
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,520
- But that's when I got
the letter three days ago,

1040
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,610
said you were coming up
here to save me the trip

1041
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:22,593
to Showdown Creek.

1042
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:24,801
- What is that, sir?

1043
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:27,040
- Got a letter from the attorney

1044
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,540
representing you as syndicate.

1045
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:30,693
Here.

1046
01:00:31,943 --> 01:00:34,735
A Mr. Chad Deasy.

1047
01:00:34,735 --> 01:00:37,735
(suspenseful music)

1048
01:00:55,143 --> 01:00:57,976
(horse galloping)

1049
01:01:04,385 --> 01:01:06,281
(gun fires)

1050
01:01:06,281 --> 01:01:08,344
(horse neighs)

1051
01:01:08,344 --> 01:01:10,511
- Well.
- Mm, getting late.

1052
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:14,880
- Maybe the kids staying over
in Gunstock for the night.

1053
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:15,713
- No.

1054
01:01:24,377 --> 01:01:25,477
- Any word from Tracy.

1055
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,803
- No.
- Getting late.

1056
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:29,833
- I know.

1057
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:32,120
- I just saw Deasy.

1058
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,330
Squatting like a vulture.

1059
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:35,203
Just waiting.

1060
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:50,072
(horse galloping)

1061
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,760
Any ideas, Brock?

1062
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,370
- No, he knows the notes due tonight.

1063
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,070
He should have been here long ago.

1064
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,720
- Here's my check for the Mitchell note.

1065
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,740
Time's not up yet.

1066
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:23,850
I'm a patient man,

1067
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:26,200
but you're beginning to try me.

1068
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,920
There's not one chance for
Mitchell and you know it.

1069
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,830
- What makes you so sure?

1070
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,490
- I'll be in my office at six.

1071
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:35,240
Just make certain that you
show up there right on time.

1072
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:47,250
- I'm really worried, Brock.

1073
01:02:50,094 --> 01:02:51,344
- Yes, so am I.

1074
01:02:59,319 --> 01:03:01,819
(door closes)

1075
01:03:31,278 --> 01:03:33,861
(horse neighs)

1076
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,053
- Brock!

1077
01:04:02,316 --> 01:04:04,816
(Tracy thuds)

1078
01:04:07,323 --> 01:04:08,300
- I saw Phelps.

1079
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:09,423
- Don't talk, Trace.

1080
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,193
Get the doctor.

1081
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,380
Then I hid the letter Phelps gave me

1082
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:24,270
under some rock.

1083
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:25,653
- Tracy, please don't talk.

1084
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:30,391
- I got to tell you now,

1085
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,403
Sutton bushwhacked me.

1086
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:42,193
He left me for dead.

1087
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:50,093
I made it back to the rocks got letters.

1088
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,267
Letters that...

1089
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,010
Deasy wrote Phelps

1090
01:05:05,930 --> 01:05:06,813
told him to wait.

1091
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:15,450
Other letter Phelps gave me

1092
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:21,480
assurance of deal

1093
01:05:24,774 --> 01:05:26,607
to give to Van Steed.

1094
01:05:36,262 --> 01:05:37,679
- Trace, hold on.

1095
01:05:48,457 --> 01:05:50,624
Trace, you leave me alone.

1096
01:05:53,263 --> 01:05:54,263
You hear me?

1097
01:06:15,876 --> 01:06:17,209
Don't cover him!

1098
01:06:37,755 --> 01:06:39,005
Leave us alone.

1099
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:54,323
- I wouldn't go in now.

1100
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:50,693
- Chad Deasy had your brother killed.

1101
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:56,503
I killed Deasy's brother and Tracy.

1102
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,217
- No, Brock.

1103
01:07:59,823 --> 01:08:02,850
- The bullet that went
through Deasy's body,

1104
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:06,930
my blood, it never stopped
until it found Trace

1105
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:10,543
and killed him.

1106
01:08:11,445 --> 01:08:13,380
- My father is the law.

1107
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,430
But the law is and always justice, Brock.

1108
01:08:17,675 --> 01:08:19,193
You didn't murder Sim Deasy.

1109
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:21,523
I know that now,

1110
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,543
but Tracy was murdered.

1111
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,723
Tracy never harmed anyone.

1112
01:08:32,815 --> 01:08:34,433
He never even carried a gun.

1113
01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:37,480
They murdered him, Brock,

1114
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:40,690
and if you don't settle this yourself,

1115
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:42,310
you desert your own brother.

1116
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,343
You can let Trace's life go for nothing,

1117
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:04,613
and I couldn't love a man who would.

1118
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,543
- I can't touch a gun again.

1119
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:29,570
- Pay me off.

1120
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:30,870
- Did you get the letter?

1121
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:32,630
- No letter, but the job is done.

1122
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:33,463
- What do you mean?

1123
01:09:33,463 --> 01:09:34,920
- The job's done, finished.

1124
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,717
Now pay me off.
- the letter.

1125
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:42,980
- No, one's gonna find out
anything until tomorrow.

1126
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,193
- Find out what?

1127
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:47,060
- Tracy Mitchell is dead.

1128
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,580
I had to gun him.

1129
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:50,903
- You killed him?
- Yeah.

1130
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:53,400
Now pay me off.
- You killed him.

1131
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:54,480
- My pay!

1132
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:55,963
- Brock Mitchell's brother.

1133
01:09:57,260 --> 01:10:00,000
- Yeah, I killed Brock Mitchell's brother.

1134
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,467
- Brock Mitchell, you killed his brother.

1135
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:05,210
- Now you want the credit?

1136
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:06,780
All right, you say you killed him.

1137
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,127
I won't argue with you.

1138
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:10,610
- You don't understand Mitchell.

1139
01:10:10,610 --> 01:10:11,843
He'll come after me.

1140
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,210
- Just be polite to him.

1141
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:17,530
- He'll kill me.

1142
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:18,820
You can't leave me.

1143
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:20,330
You gotta protect me.

1144
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:21,680
He'll come after you too,

1145
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,513
he'll kill you too.

1146
01:10:22,513 --> 01:10:23,643
- I'll be long gone by
the time he finds out.

1147
01:10:23,643 --> 01:10:25,280
- You are my bodyguard,

1148
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,392
you've got to protect me.

1149
01:10:26,392 --> 01:10:27,225
- Let go!

1150
01:10:27,225 --> 01:10:29,166
- You can't leave me here alone.

1151
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:29,999
Let go of me.

1152
01:10:29,999 --> 01:10:32,499
(punch thuds)

1153
01:10:44,369 --> 01:10:46,920
(door opens)

1154
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,550
- All right Sutton, we're not slow,

1155
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:50,843
keep your hands up.

1156
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:54,620
Hold it.

1157
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,940
No, gun play.

1158
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:57,410
Go down to Parkman building,

1159
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:58,776
we want to take him alive.

1160
01:10:58,776 --> 01:11:00,481
- But.
- Wait a minute.

1161
01:11:00,481 --> 01:11:02,981
- Hey Kim, Herbert, cover him.

1162
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,294
Hey, Herbert?

1163
01:11:14,802 --> 01:11:15,635
Get back.

1164
01:11:26,243 --> 01:11:29,743
(tense suspenseful music)

1165
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:04,025
(gun fires)

1166
01:12:06,516 --> 01:12:07,905
(tense music)

1167
01:12:07,905 --> 01:12:10,405
(guns firing)

1168
01:12:11,952 --> 01:12:13,202
Hold your fire!

1169
01:12:15,935 --> 01:12:17,277
- What's the matter?

1170
01:12:17,277 --> 01:12:18,793
You run out of bullets?

1171
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,030
Okay, this is the way it's gonna be.

1172
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:26,333
I'm getting on my horse,

1173
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:28,780
the girls getting on with me.

1174
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,113
We're leaving this town,

1175
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,082
and nobody's gonna stop us.

1176
01:12:36,082 --> 01:12:39,439
(suspenseful music)

1177
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:41,184
all right, little one.

1178
01:12:41,184 --> 01:12:44,184
(suspenseful music)

1179
01:13:03,452 --> 01:13:05,869
(belt thuds)

1180
01:13:08,892 --> 01:13:10,225
- [Man] Hold it!

1181
01:13:11,801 --> 01:13:14,773
- Sutton, let the girl go.

1182
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,660
Sutton, I'm asking you as a father,

1183
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:19,983
let my girl go!

1184
01:13:22,151 --> 01:13:24,651
(door closes)

1185
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:29,627
- Well, the gunless gutless Wonder.

1186
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:34,070
(tense music)

1187
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:36,213
- Wait!

1188
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:40,240
You're my bodyguard,

1189
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,343
I paid you, you can't leave me.

1190
01:13:43,343 --> 01:13:45,343
I'll ruin you.
- Get off.

1191
01:13:47,235 --> 01:13:50,500
(guns firing)

1192
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,230
- My bodyguard, I'll ruin you.

1193
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:54,690
I'll ruin all of you.

1194
01:13:54,690 --> 01:13:57,367
Sutton bomb that's what
I'll make out of you.

1195
01:13:57,367 --> 01:13:59,336
(slap thuds)

1196
01:13:59,336 --> 01:14:01,026
(guns firing)

1197
01:14:01,026 --> 01:14:03,609
(horse neighs)

1198
01:14:08,301 --> 01:14:11,301
(suspenseful music)

1199
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:23,743
Don't shoot.

1200
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:27,520
- There's nothing more
that gun can do to you,

1201
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:31,679
or for you.

1202
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:34,679
(suspenseful music)

1203
01:14:50,886 --> 01:14:52,807
(horse gallops)

1204
01:14:52,807 --> 01:14:55,474
(ominous music)

1205
01:15:03,398 --> 01:15:05,981
(upbeat music)
