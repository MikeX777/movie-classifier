1
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,558
I'm Dr. Ahmad Khalil Abu Nakira, diagnostic and intensive care specialist,

2
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,991
deputy director of Al-Najar Hospital.

3
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,838
I live in Shabura.

4
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,357
The US citizen had multiple fractures

5
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,796
in the limbs and neck.

6
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,032
She had bleeding from the mouth

7
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,153
and her lips were purple.

8
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,116
She exhibited
the symptoms suffocation.

9
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,039
We did all we could to save her,

10
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,799
but in vain.

11
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,318
Major Avital Leibovich...

12
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,391
<i>You are the Israeli Defense Forces international spokesperson.

13
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,155
<i>Thank you</i>

14
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,799
<i>for your time.</i>

15
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,913
<i>Were you an IDF spokesperson in March 2003?</i>

16
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,919
Yes. I remember that case.

17
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,433
It received a lot of press.

18
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,673
Both Israeli and international media
covered it.

19
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,472
IDF SPOKESPERSON DOCUMENT

20
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,111
The lDF was operating in an area

21
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,189
known militarily the Philadelphi Route,

22
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,672
in the southern Gaza Strip,

23
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,598
near the Egyptian border.

24
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,752
In this area,

25
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,915
thousands of grenades had been thrown,

26
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,152
rockets were fired,

27
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,796
hundreds explosive devices were laid,

28
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,390
a threat to both our forces

29
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,514
and the settlers
still living in the Gaza Strip,

30
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,473
who were targets.

31
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,518
That's why we operated there.

32
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,239
We had two bulldozers

33
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,319
and an armored vehicle.

34
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,031
The mission was twofold:

35
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,511
first, to clear the ground,

36
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,676
and second,

37
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,396
to locate concealed explosive devices.

38
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,199
Soon after our forces arrived,

39
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,879
a group of activists
from an organization called ISM,

40
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,517
a group with a pro-Palestinian agenda,

41
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,269
founded by Palestinians,

42
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,950
came on the scene
to stage provocations.

43
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,473
Let me stress that the operation
did not entail house demolition.

44
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,319
It was just a piece of land.

45
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,233
They started provocative action.

46
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,797
<i>Are you stressing that
because house demolitions are routine?</i>

47
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,798
It's not an issue of "routine."

48
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,471
We conduct sorts of actions
to protect ourselves and our settlers.

49
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,671
From the removal vegetation

50
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,871
to the clearing of land,

51
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,994
to the demolition of a house
serving as an explosives lab.

52
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,431
All sorts of things,
depending on the situation.

53
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,471
In any case, our forces arrived,

54
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,310
and 30 minutes later,

55
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,910
so did this ISM group.

56
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,639
They blocked the bulldozers

57
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,389
and started yelling slogans.

58
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,200
Attempts were made to disperse them

59
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,835
with tear gas, to no avail.

60
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,312
We even had
to take a break from working.

61
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,275
Soon, the operation resumed,

62
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,595
and that's when the incident occurred.

63
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,551
A regrettable incident,

64
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,831
because we aren't interested

65
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,833
in killing anyone who is not a terrorist.

66
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,632
The investigation collected testimony

67
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,311
from soldiers and eyewitnesses.

68
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,638
There was an autopsy report,

69
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,674
and evidence was collected in the field.

70
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,272
After much work,
the investigation ended.

71
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,439
The findings were conclusive:

72
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,669
There was no direct contact
between the bulldozer and the deceased.

73
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,078
There was a pile of dirt,

74
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,511
and she was standing behind it,

75
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,271
The driver couldn't!see her.

76
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,878
From what we understood,

77
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,551
she was buried beneath dirt and sand.

78
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,877
My name is Dr. Samir Nasrallah.

79
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,639
I'm a pharmacist.

80
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,911
I live in Rafah,

81
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,431
in the Gaza Strip,

82
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,476
along the border
between Egypt and Palestine.

83
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,038
Returning from work,

84
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,433
I saw two tanks, 100 meters away,
and a bulldozer.

85
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,438
I saw Rachel Corrie and Alice

86
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,999
and I went inside.

87
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,669
The gate was here.

88
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,794
I opened the gate

89
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,360
and went in

90
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,990
The front yard of the house was here.

91
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,675
I went in,

92
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,200
I walked into the rooms...

93
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,120
and said hello my children.

94
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,919
"What's going on?" I asked.

95
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,511
"I see Rachel and her friends outside."

96
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,270
They said, "Bulldozers and tanks
are destroying the land."

97
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,557
I said, "Let's have a cup of tea,"

98
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,840
and went to the window

99
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,551
to see what they were doing.

100
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,789
I saw Rachel and her friends,
trying to stop the bulldozer

101
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,398
with their bodies and arms.

102
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,194
When the bulldozer turned
towards my house and advanced,

103
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,239
I called to my brother
and his kids upsłairs.

104
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,150
"You'd better come sit down here,"
I told them.

105
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,833
The bulldozer kept on.

106
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,191
The driver could see her clearly.

107
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,993
He could see just fine.

108
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,590
There was nobody here but her

109
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,558
and me, just behind her.

110
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,712
I was behind the fence.
I saw everything, minute by minute.

111
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,992
Her four friends
were standing over there,

112
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,150
on the ruins of my neighbors' house.

113
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,239
I kept watching.

114
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,434
The bulldozer approached,

115
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,759
scooping up dirt,
which piled on her feet.

116
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,038
She lost her balance.

117
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,720
The machine advanced
with its blade above her, then reversed.

118
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,511
I ran, hoping the injury was minor.

119
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,430
I quickly took cotton, gauze

120
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,631
first-aid supplies.

121
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,999
Then I took my phone
and called my friends

122
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,918
at Al-Najar Hospital.

123
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,993
I told them, "We've got an emergency.

124
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,592
"The Jews have killed our friend Rachel Corrie."

125
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,637
My name is Muhammad Jamil Keshta.

126
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,995
I was born in Rafah in 1956.

127
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,990
Since my house was demolished,

128
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,719
I live in Al-Obour.

129
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,879
Before that, I lived in Rafah.

130
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,233
At the time, the situation was atrocious.

131
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,311
The Israelis destroyed houses

132
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,558
right over people's heads.

133
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,556
I lived near Salah al-Din Gate,

134
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,471
across from an Israeli outpost 
called Termit.

135
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,596
We knew Rachel Corrie.

136
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,236
She was courageous,
with her Arafat-style keffiyeh.

137
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,589
She paid tor her ideals with her life.

138
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,071
All over the world,
they talk about me, Abu Jamil.

139
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,274
In their letters,
they mention Abu Jamil's specialities.

140
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,029
I cooked such dishes for them!

141
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,830
They were like children to me.

142
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:56,551
I cooked everything for her:
squash, lentils, beans,

143
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,150
peppers-and-eggs, potatoes!

144
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,591
It didn't cost me much.

145
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,793
Even if it had, they deserved it!

146
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,312
They're respectful and well-educated.

147
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,871
If people came

148
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,037
from America and Europe to protect you,

149
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,757
what would you offer them?
You'd give your eyes.

150
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,439
You'd sacrifice yourself,

151
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,873
go begging just to feed them
as they came to protect you.

152
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,077
In the middle of the night,
Rachel would take a megaphone:

153
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,639
"Stop shooting!

154
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,676
"Here in this house,
there are children and internationals!"

155
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,876
Without firing a single bullet!

156
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,994
<i>How old are you?</i>

157
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,837
Almost 25,

158
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,511
<i>When were you in the army?</i>

159
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,033
Between 2000 and 2003. 

160
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,234
<i>Where did you serve?</i>

161
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,678
I was a tank gunner,

162
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,558
mostly stationed in Gaza,
Jericho, Tulkarm, Qalqilya, Ramallah.

163
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,870
<i>How long were you in Gaza?</i>

164
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,715
A year and a half, all together.

165
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,518
<i>Were you at the outpost facing Rafah?</i>

166
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,918
Yes. I was there for six months.

167
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,430
<i>- What's the ourpost called?</i>
- Termit.

168
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,597
<i>What's special about it?</i>

169
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,517
It was manned by Bedouin soldiers.

170
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,556
To assist them, there were also

171
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,958
two or three tanks, when needed,

172
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,799
and some D9 bulldozers.

173
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,673
<i>What were your assignments?</i>

174
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,880
"Artichoke" ambushes every night,

175
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,353
and incursions inside the city

176
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,031
to "expose" houses,

177
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,269
or when armed men advanced toward us.

178
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,389
<i>"Exposing houses" mean demolishing?"</i>

179
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,431
Yes.

180
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,154
<i>Did you demolish many?</i>

181
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,796
I wasn't in a position to demolish.
I just shelled,

182
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,912
while the D9s demolished.

183
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,476
You fire at the house a little,
to see if anyone's home.

184
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,910
Then you start wrecking.

185
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,350
They either come out or they don't.

186
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,115
When I first got there,
the houses went right up to the wall.

187
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,995
When I left,
There was a clearing 800 meters wide.

188
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,629
<i>When you say, "Fire a little,"</i>

189
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,430
<i>do you mean fire a lot?</i>

190
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,955
Yes.

191
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,320
There was a period when we had orders

192
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,434
to shoot hourly, just to scare them.

193
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,358
So we'd shoot by the hour.

194
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,989
A house, a window, a water tank...

195
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,511
If the commander was laid back,

196
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,791
we could shoot houses for fun.

197
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,638
<i>Did you shoot for fun?</i>

198
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,990
Yes.

199
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,794
<i>Shells?</i>

200
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,756
No, Shells are for armed groups,

201
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,954
or vehicles with armed men,

202
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,514
not for fun.

203
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,391
<i>You said you shot water tanks?</i>

204
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,993
Yes. Because with the artichoke,

205
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,840
you can see the water is hot.

206
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,715
It looks good at night.

207
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,834
<i>-What is this "artichoke"?</i>
- The tank's night vision system.

208
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,514
When you shoot a water tank,
you see water pouring out.

209
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,236
It looks cool. That's why we did it.

210
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,233
<i>You didn't think,
"This is precious drinking water"?</i>

211
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,555
Never.

212
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,232
<i>How can one not think of such things?</i>

213
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,279
It's hard to explain.

214
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,437
It's unlike me.

215
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,793
I only understood it was wrong
after the army.

216
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,674
I can't be sure I won't do it again.

217
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,874
As a civilian, I'm a gentle person.

218
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,874
I can't explain it.

219
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,230
<i>Did you kill people?</i>

220
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,316
Yes.

221
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,510
<i>Many?</i>

222
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,354
Relatively, yes.

223
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,713
<i>Were there innocent people
among them?</i>

224
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,399
I'm certain there were.

225
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,237
I know there were many
who were terrorists,

226
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,070
but I also know
There was a woman and a child.

227
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,112
The rest, I'm less sure about.

228
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,352
<i>-Are you religious, may I ask?</i>
- Yes.

229
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,756
<i>-Did you pray there?</i>
- Yes.

230
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,994
<i>Did you link your faith and actions?</i>

231
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,033
<i>Did you ever feel conflicted?</i>

232
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,755
Never.

233
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,720
It was routine.

234
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,475
<i>I am Captain B.K.,
Engineering Corps reservist,</i>

235
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,838
<i>a company commander.</i>

236
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,838
<i>This bulldozer is particularly large,</i>

237
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,918
<i>a D9 armored model.</i>

238
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,477
<i>It weighs some 65 tons,</i>

239
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,549
<i>which means it moves slowly
and is cumbersome.</i>

240
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,834
<i>It's not hard to maneuver,
but one's vision is restricted</i>

241
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,397
<i>by the armor required in this area.</i>

242
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,432
<i>The commander,
during the incident was A.</i>

243
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,518
<i>I forget his last name.</i>

244
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,751
<i>The operator's name is Y.F.</i>

245
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,270
<i>He is an honest, straightforward guy,</i>

246
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,439
<i>who obeys my orders
without disciplinary problems.</i>

247
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,953
<i>I have nothing to add.</i>

248
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,834
<i>This is my true and correct testimony,</i>

249
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,191
<i>as given to the MP investigator.</i>

250
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,836
<i>I hereby read and validate it
with my signature.</i>

251
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,512
<i>Shami Cohen,
you are an army reserve colonel.</i>

252
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,755
Yes.

253
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,673
<i>You headed the Military Police
investigations unit</i>

254
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,316
<i>-in March 2003.</i>
- Correct.

255
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:01,037
<i>That is, you oversaw
the Military Police investigation</i>

256
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,790
<i>into Rachel Corrie's death.</i>

257
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,717
Correct.

258
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,950
First, There was an operational inquiry,

259
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,357
a debriefing
at which the soldiers are told,

260
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,078
"No harm can come to you
as a result of this inquiry."

261
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,234
Soldiers involved in an incident

262
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,837
are debriefed by their commanders.

263
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,270
They can tell them everything,

264
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,155
because what they say
cannot be used against them,

265
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,000
should a criminal investigation ensue.

266
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:42,354
As operational inquiries are Classified,
they are off-limits to military police.

267
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,234
As a military police investigator,

268
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,151
I cannot use the operational inquiry
as a source,

269
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:53,159
or cite any of its findings.

270
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,959
None of that is available to me.

271
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,390
If it fell into my hands,

272
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,833
it might disqualify my team
from investigating.

273
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,189
one must also understand
that for a police unit

274
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,478
whose duty is to gather evidence

275
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,755
admissible in a court of law,

276
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,111
time is of the essence.

277
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,033
That was one of our biggest problems.

278
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,950
When I reached the scene
of Rachel Corrie!s death

279
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,470
- may she rest in peace -
There was no tank, no bulldozers,

280
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,838
no corpse.

281
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,511
The site itself was inaccessible.

282
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,549
The medical team who had treated her
was gone.

283
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,439
There were no bullets, nothing.

284
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,589
From a legal viewpoint,
the site had been compromised.

285
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,834
Going there was next to useless.

286
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,554
All I had to work with

287
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,196
was soldiers' statements
obtained during questioning.

288
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,595
The questioning became everything.

289
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,592
Now, let's imagine a situation
which is rare,

290
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,029
but does happen:

291
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,436
The soldiers maintain their silence.

292
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,554
This one covers for that one,
who covers for the other one...

293
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,229
They all cover for each other.

294
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,715
The only investigative tool I have
is questioning.

295
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,798
Investigators are told

296
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,640
to go out and find the truth,

297
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,513
discover who's guilty,

298
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,397
but the only means they're given
is questioning.

299
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,597
<i>What about Rachels friends?</i>

300
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,633
Some of them testified,

301
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,149
but not all.

302
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,918
The Palestinians

303
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,473
were nearly impossible to track down.

304
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,719
It required military coordination,
because it's a warzone.

305
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,117
The IDF shoots and gets shot at.

306
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,834
It's a war zone.

307
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,314
No, we did not question
all the witnesses to the incident.

308
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,149
<i>I am Major S.R.,</i>

309
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,272
<i>deputy commander</i>

310
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,474
<i>of the Desert Reconnaissance Battalion.</i>

311
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,399
<i>On the afternoon
of March 16, 2003,</i>

312
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,752
<i>I ordered the flattening
of the Philadelphi Route</i>

313
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,838
<i>along the exposed area,</i>

314
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,909
<i>from Philadelphi 21 to 23.</i>

315
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,791
<i>I am Sergeant S.L.</i>

316
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:41,675
<i>I have been a reservist
since February 23, 2003,</i>

317
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,231
<i>as a D9 bulldozer operator.</i>

318
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,116
<i>On March 16, 2003,
we were given a briefing</i>

319
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,552
<i>by the company commander.</i>

320
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,751
<i>My bulldozer commander,</i>

321
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,429
<i>a reservist named S.A, myself,</i>

322
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,439
<i>and a second D9 bulldozer team,</i>

323
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,191
<i>commander E.V. and operator Y.F,
were present.</i>

324
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,639
<i>There was also another officer
and two active duty soldiers.</i>

325
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,956
<i>The armoured vehicle commander
was Captain R.S.</i>

326
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,029
<i>He oversaw forces on the ground.</i>

327
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,230
<i>At the time, I was at the Liaison HQ,</i>

328
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,070
<i>as the senior officer in the sector.</i>

329
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,475
<i>As they worked,</i>

330
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,152
<i>a group of foreign activists
came to harass them.</i>

331
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,029
<i>They've been here for three months,</i>

332
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,711
<i>disturbing us
whenever we go on a mission.</i>

333
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,438
<i>They enter the suspect's home</i>

334
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,953
<i>and try to prevent the demolition
by any means possible.</i>

335
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,153
<i>They kept running around the bulldozers</i>

336
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,236
<i>on the sides, in front, in the rear.</i>

337
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,716
<i>This went on for four hours.</i>

338
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,519
<i>At around 4:30 PM,</i>

339
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,795
<i>I was operatįng my bulldozer
about 20 meters north of Y.F.</i>

340
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,792
<i>I saw all the civilian peace activists
running towards his bulldozer</i>

341
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,913
<i>and heard a radio order to stop working.</i>

342
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,716
<i>I looked at the other bulldozer</i>

343
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,118
<i>and saw a mound of dirt two meters high</i>

344
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,870
<i>and 4 or 5 meters wide,</i>

345
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,555
<i>made by the bulldozer.</i>

346
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,918
<i>on the eastern side of the mound,</i>

347
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,591
<i>I saw a girl in her twenties
lying on the ground.</i>

348
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,109
<i>I didn't see
if she was injured or dead.</i>

349
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,036
<i>But she was in one piece.
I'm not at all sure she was dead.</i>

350
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,036
<i>I don't know her, or know who she is.</i>

351
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,553
<i>I did not learn of her death
from a medical report,</i>

352
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,719
<i>only from the media.</i>

353
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,756
<i>From what I know of Y.F.,</i>

354
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,360
<i>he's a careful operator.</i>

355
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,633
<i>Since the incident, he's been distraught.</i>

356
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,231
<i>He's sensitive, a family man.</i>

357
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,039
<i>He'd never have hit her deliberately.
I don't think the bulldozer hit her.</i>

358
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,910
<i>The civilian Rachel Corrie
- may she rest in peace -</i>

359
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,272
<i>probably hid behind the dirt mound.</i>

360
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:39,556
<i>She thought the D9 would stop
when the operator saw her.</i>

361
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,552
<i>She intentionally lay
at the foot of the mound.</i>

362
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,159
<i>Even if we wanted to see her,
we couldn't have.</i>

363
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,797
<i>I have nothing to add.</i>

364
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,435
<i>This is my true and correct testimony,</i>

365
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,712
<i>as given to the MP investigator.</i>

366
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,313
<i>I hereby read and validate it
with my signature.</i>

367
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,673
The border was full of tanks.

368
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,114
Everytime we went out,
they fired at us.

369
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,271
When the foreigners arrived,
I was old,

370
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:41,793
"These people are peace activists.

371
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:45,596
Do you want one at your place?"
I said, "Give me two or three."

372
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,436
In the first group,
we got an Englishman named Ben,

373
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,638
a psychiatrist.

374
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,916
Then we got a Jew named David,

375
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,520
also an Englishman.

376
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,353
I hosted them.

377
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,560
Then they brought some girls.
Two girls, then some others.

378
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,275
After a wile, they were saying,

379
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,517
"We want to stay with Abu Ahmad!"

380
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,110
Themselves!

381
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,238
They were here
for breakfast and dinner.

382
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,876
All day, they did actions.

383
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,117
I'd give them sandwiches,

384
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,712
one or two apiece...

385
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,555
God bless them!

386
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,152
At dusk, they'd say,
"We want to sleep at Abu Ahmad's."

387
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,151
They loved us and I loved them.

388
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,432
They had come to help us.

389
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,070
They weren't here to kill us,

390
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,600
but to resist the fire alongside us.

391
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,473
I remember Rachel

392
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,040
the day she died.

393
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,709
They phoned her, and she came.

394
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,436
I invited her to come in.

395
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,830
"No, Abu Ahmad."

396
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,270
She wore a scarf like this one.

397
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,119
She went to confront them.

398
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,031
I never saw her again.

399
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,597
I told her, "Stay here!"

400
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,271
"Rachel, it's dangerous! Don't go!"

401
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,471
She replied, "No, I'm going."

402
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,111
I couldn't hold her back.

403
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:25,594
It was her destiny.

404
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,879
GHASSAN ANDONI
ISM founder

405
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,271
<i>The witnesses I met are convinced</i>

406
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,473
<i>that he saw her and didn't stop.</i>

407
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,670
<i>If you gathered their testimonies,
they contradict the soldiers.</i>

408
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,159
We gathered some.

409
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:11,514
<i>How do you resolve it?</i>

410
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,120
This contradiction

411
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,917
arose in the investigation,

412
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:23,270
because all the civilians we questioned
claimed, as you just stated,

413
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:27,314
that it was impossible
for him not to see her.

414
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,399
But the soldiers said the opposite.

415
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:35,595
Visibility from the bulldozer cab
is severely impaired.

416
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:40,118
The driver's field of vision
is exłremely limited.

417
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:43,313
The cab sits very high,

418
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:48,191
and the windows
are just narrow look-out slits.

419
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:51,035
So, they say they couldn't see her.

420
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:55,070
All the versions of the events

421
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:58,113
were given
to the Military Advocate General.

422
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,349
It is his duty to determine
whether there was criminal intent

423
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,709
and sufficient evidence

424
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,790
to prosecute the soldiers
in a court martial.

425
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,277
In this case,

426
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:18,238
he decided there was no criminal intent,

427
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:20,272
despite contradictory accounts.

428
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,039
Versions never agree:

429
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,834
The victims and perpetrators

430
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,715
usually contradict each other,
and one must choose.

431
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,110
How do you choose?

432
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,556
Based on evidence from the scene,

433
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,478
but we never made it there!

434
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,679
<i>If you'd been asked
to add recommendations</i>

435
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,113
<i>to the investigative report you submitted,</i>

436
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,073
<i>what would they be?</i>

437
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,469
Difficult question.

438
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:58,078
On the one hand, it's troubling

439
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:03,715
that a civilian was killed.

440
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,358
on the other, these soldiers

441
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:11,838
were fighting for their lives

442
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:14,077
whenever they were in this zone.

443
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:20,872
Under the circumstances,
I wouldn't amend my decision.

444
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,399
I really don't think so.

445
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,510
Had my investigators arrived

446
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,433
just after the incident,

447
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,438
when the bulldozer

448
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,189
and Rachel Corrie's body remained,

449
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:38,079
I might have reached
a different conclusion.

450
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,879
APRIL 1, 2003

451
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:02,631
ISRAELI CHANNEL 2 DOCUMENT

452
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:05,878
A D9 is manned by two people.

453
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,878
<i>Like a pilot and navigator?</i>

454
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,629
You could say that.

455
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,478
<i>Each sees a different area?</i>

456
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:12,829
Yes.

457
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,511
<i>When you ride with your helmets on,</i>

458
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,150
<i>can you hear anything?</i>

459
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,559
No, you can't hear anything

460
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,672
happening outside.

461
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,871
I'd never seen these foreigners.

462
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:29,673
I thought they were

463
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,871
Palestinians in disguise.

464
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,992
<i>They looked Palestinian to you?</i>

465
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,473
There are white Palestinians, too.

466
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,716
I wouldn't expect to see anyone

467
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,911
besides Palestinians here.

468
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:45,358
So I made my Assumption.

469
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,960
Then, via radio,

470
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,117
I was told they were foreigners,

471
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,835
from some organization.

472
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:57,276
The tractor moves at walking speed.

473
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,314
Even slower.

474
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,114
With a mound of dirt,

475
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,073
It can't go any faster.

476
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,030
We were pushing dirt,

477
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,470
and suddenly we saw people

478
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,194
waving their arms.

479
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,955
I understood something had happened.

480
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:16,154
So I told him, "Stop.

481
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,714
"Back up."

482
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,673
We lowered the blade

483
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,315
because it obstructed our view.

484
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,113
With the blade lowered,

485
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,390
we saw the body.

486
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:30,236
But we were already far.

487
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,229
Thirty or forty meters, maybe.

488
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,955
I didn't count.

489
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,670
When I saw her,

490
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,839
I realized we had hit someone.

491
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,116
<i>And then?</i>

492
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,878
We moved further back.

493
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:51,156
We backed up...

494
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:54,193
We parked on the Route.

495
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,915
I awaited orders.

496
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:01,079
We felt awful.

497
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,795
It shouldn't have happened.

498
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:11,110
<i>How could it have been avoided?</i>

499
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,954
If you ask us...

500
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,513
Drive away and not work there.

501
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,590
But we had orders.

502
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,271
We have to do what we're told.

503
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,869
It's a huge, heavy machine.

504
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,954
If I had run over a person,

505
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,514
there'd be nothing left.

506
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,831
They wouldn't even have found her.

507
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,794
Not even pieces.

508
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,392
So I don't think I ran over her.

509
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,558
It's very heavy equipment.

510
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:37,473
<i>30 for D9-2!</i>

511
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,194
<i>D9-2, 30!</i>

512
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,879
<i>D9, HQ!</i>

513
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,391
<i>I hit someone.</i>

514
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,554
<i>Where are you, HQ?</i>

515
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,635
<i>Roger. Over.</i>

516
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,271
<i>Roger,
It seems something fell on someone.</i>

517
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,471
<i>He was too close to the D9</i>

518
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,353
<i>and got a little hurt.</i>

519
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,514
<i>- One of the foreigners?
-Positive.</i>

520
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,434
<i>Roger. Has he been evacuated?</i>

521
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:19,998
<i>Positive. It's underway.</i>

522
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:22,432
<i>Do you know what fell on him?</i>

523
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:26,232
<i>A stone, apparently. We're checking.</i>

524
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:30,199
<i>Roger. A stone fell from the D9?</i>

525
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:31,231
<i>Positive.</i>

526
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,669
<i>Roger.</i>

527
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,031
<i>Apparently, someone was hit by the D9</i>

528
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,072
<i>and is in critical condition.</i>

529
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:25,238
<i>Roger. Hit by the D9,
or something that fell on him?</i>

530
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:29,270
<i>He must have come up behind the D9</i>

531
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:31,954
<i>and into its path.</i>

532
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:33,389
<i>Roger.</i>

533
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,429
<i>D9-1, move back to the Route.</i>

534
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,759
<i>Roger.</i>

535
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:37,912
<i>Have you seen him?</i>

536
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,873
<i>Yes. I think he's dead.</i>

537
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,999
<i>Dead?</i>

538
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,119
<i>God have mercy on him.</i>

539
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:38,636
I am the Chief Forensic Pathologist.

540
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,753
When Rachel died,

541
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,679
I was the director of this center,

542
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,031
and I performed the autopsy.

543
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:51,758
The report on the circumstances
was brief and imprecise,

544
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:54,713
saying she might have been hit
by a tractor.

545
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:59,517
So we looked tor mechanical damage

546
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:04,920
that would indicate injury by a tractor.

547
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:09,751
We found minor damage to her body,

548
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:14,159
head, arms, legs, and chest.

549
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:17,592
But all of it was relatively minor.

550
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,872
No signs of having been run over
by a tractor.

551
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:25,114
She had other signs
like bleeding from the eyes,

552
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:30,315
characteristic of death by suffocation.

553
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:35,077
These findings led me to the conclusion

554
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:40,833
that her death was due to pressure
from a heavy object.

555
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:45,239
<i>The heavy object
must have been the blade...</i>

556
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:49,593
It could have been, but usually
we find that a tractor blade,

557
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,199
a metal object,

558
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:57,192
leaves tell tale marks
on the body of the victim.

559
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,470
In this case,

560
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:02,879
whatever exerted pressure on her
was softer than metal.

561
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:06,312
I cannot rule out the blade
as a possibility.

562
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:11,589
However, it so, a layer of sand
between her body and the blade

563
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:16,955
must have absorbed some
of the impact of the blade or tractor.

564
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,833
<i>Her parents told me</i>

565
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:25,752
<i>they refused to allow an autopsy
to be performed</i>

566
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,389
<i>unless a US official was present.</i>

567
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:31,194
True. They wrote a letter

568
01:27:31,480 --> 01:27:35,394
requesting American diplomatic presence.

569
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:39,469
I contacted the US Embassy,
as noted in my autopsy report.

570
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:43,515
But the Embassy did not see fit
to send a representative.

571
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:45,313
I fully agree

572
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:50,390
that the autopsy authorization
filed by Rachel's parents

573
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,479
demanded American diplomatic presence.

574
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:57,390
We have nothing to hide.

575
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:01,560
We prefer that the family be represented.

576
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:05,151
But when the Embassy informed me
that they weren't interested,

577
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:10,719
or that the presence was unneeded,
we proceeded with the autopsy.

578
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,194
<i>I am Colonel P.Z.,</i>

579
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:26,111
<i>Chief-Commander of the
Gaza Division Southern Brigade.</i>

580
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,637
<i>The Military Police asked me</i>

581
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:34,515
<i>to comment on the death
of the US citizen Corrie, Rachel</i>

582
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,997
<i>on March 16, 2003</i>

583
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:41,033
<i>near Philadelphi Route point 23.</i>

584
01:28:41,680 --> 01:28:43,193
<i>Here are my remarks:</i>

585
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,074
<i>The Desert Reconnaissance Battalion
was doing land grading work</i>

586
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:54,433
<i>to reduce the capacity
of terrorist organizations</i>

587
01:28:54,720 --> 01:28:59,317
<i>to lay explosives in piles of dirt
and construction debris there.</i>

588
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,352
<i>Our forces began working at around 1 PM.</i>

589
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,918
<i>They were continually harassed
by activists from leftist groups.</i>

590
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:12,238
<i>Several times, they backed off</i>

591
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,672
<i>and tried to disperse them by loudspeaker</i>

592
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:18,873
<i>and various crowd control methods.</i>

593
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,352
<i>All these attempts were in vain.</i>

594
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:26,952
<i>There was blatant disrespect for
and indifference to the soldiers.</i>

595
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:32,673
<i>Soldiers and commanders complied fully
with regulations and orders.</i>

596
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:37,989
<i>This incident was caused
by the protesters' reckless behavior.</i>

597
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:44,311
<i>Moreover, I must praise the forces
for their restraint that day.</i>

598
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:48,151
<i>I have nothing to add.</i>

599
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:51,717
<i>This is my true and correct testimony.</i>

600
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:55,152
<i>I hereby validate it with my signature.</i>

601
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,557
My name is Yonatan Polak.

602
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,474
I lived here in Jaffa, 2002-'06.

603
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:59,630
This is where I was living
when the bulldozer killed Rachel.

604
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,470
ISM activists sometimes slept here.

605
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:05,673
I'm also active with them.

606
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:11,069
In 2003,
after the bulldozer killed Rachel,

607
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:14,193
some of her friends came here.

608
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:17,040
Three at first; then a fourth.

609
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,874
They stayed a few days.

610
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:26,359
They needed a safe haven to recover.

611
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,039
They were traumatized.

612
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:54,114
My grandparents were Communists.

613
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:57,558
My grandfather was jailed in the 1950s.

614
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:06,396
I attended my first protest rally
when I was two months old!

615
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:09,792
Against the massacres
at Sabra and Shatila.

616
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:14,511
The first protest I remember
was at the start of the first Intifiada.

617
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:18,032
The main thing I remember

618
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:22,434
was the mounted police who were sent in

619
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,793
to disperse us.

620
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:32,600
I was twelve then,
and have been an activist ever since.

621
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:37,909
I go to demonstrations
and engage in direct action

622
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,555
like blocking bulldozers,

623
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,998
damaging the wall,

624
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,794
sabotaging occupation infrastructure.

625
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,238
Crossing the lines,

626
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,315
joining the resistance,
not just speaking out but...

627
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,191
taking action,

628
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,753
I don't think I could live here,

629
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,720
regardless of the prospects for victory,

630
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:04,237
without sharing in the resistance.

631
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:08,877
Here or anywhere else in the world,

632
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:11,276
I have a duty to resist things

633
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,278
that I consider

634
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,272
to be responsible
for the poor state of the world.

635
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:23,759
Maybe it's the difference
between our generations.

636
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:28,151
<i>Can one resist without hope?</i>

637
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:29,475
Yes.

638
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:32,634
It's possible to resist without hope

639
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,877
but also without despair.

640
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,838
Resistance is life.

641
01:33:43,400 --> 01:33:45,391
Resistance is...

642
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:49,678
a kind of truth. A kind of...

643
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,999
passion, desire...

644
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:55,318
Words that translate poorly into Hebrew.

645
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,956
I believe that in revolt...

646
01:34:04,520 --> 01:34:05,999
there is great truth,

647
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,589
whether or not it succeeds.

648
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:14,954
The people who fought
in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising

649
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:19,677
had no hope of winning.

650
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,836
But I understand why they did it.

651
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:27,600
I can see them doing it.
