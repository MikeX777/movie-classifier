1
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:16,456
The communion of saints

2
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:19,854
forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body

3
00:02:19,924 --> 00:02:21,856
and life everlasting.

4
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:24,220
Amen.

5
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,280
Let us pray.

6
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:30,689
Lord, have mercy upon us.

7
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:32,689
Christ, have mercy upon us.

8
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:33,902
Lord, have mercy upon us.

9
00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:35,087
Amen.

10
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:37,350
Our Father.

11
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,651
Our Father, which art in heaven,
hallowed...

12
00:02:39,724 --> 00:02:42,656
<i>Dear God, there's something</i>
<i>I want to ask you.</i>

13
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:44,656
<i>Of course you know what it is</i>

14
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:47,656
<i>because you know everything that's</i>
<i>going to happen before it happens.</i>

15
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:50,156
<i>So there's really no need to ask you.</i>

16
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:52,655
<i>But I thought I'd ask you in any case.</i>

17
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:55,156
<i>Now, you know that I believe in you.</i>

18
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:58,451
<i>But I was wondering</i>
<i>if you could give me just a little sign.</i>

19
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:07,190
<i>I mean, I'm not saying that</i>
<i>if you don't give me the sign</i>

20
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:10,587
<i>that I won't believe in you.</i>
<i>I'm not threatening you or anything like that.</i>

21
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,589
<i>But please, please,</i>
<i>give me enough courage</i>

22
00:03:13,657 --> 00:03:16,714
<i>to speak to Margaret Spencer</i>
<i>and get to know her.</i>

23
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,881
O God,
make clean our hearts within us.

24
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:22,718
And take not thy holy spirit from us.

25
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,718
<i>Miss Spencer,</i>

26
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,979
<i>I wonder if I could have</i>
<i>a word with you.</i>

27
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:34,955
<i>There's something</i>
<i>I've got to tell you,</i>

28
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:38,286
<i>something I've got to</i>
<i>bring out into the open.</i>

29
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:40,789
<i>I've been bottling it up</i>
<i>inside me too long</i>

30
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:44,483
<i>and there's no point</i>
<i>in hiding it anymore.</i>

31
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,990
<i>For six years now,</i>
<i>ever since you came to Wimpy's,</i>

32
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:50,921
<i>I've been in love with you.</i>

33
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,785
<i>I only live to hear your voice.</i>

34
00:03:53,857 --> 00:03:57,221
One cheeseburger, one shanty,
one portion french fries.

35
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,060
<i>Each time you speak</i>

36
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,417
<i>it's like a thousand violins</i>
<i>playing in the halls of heaven.</i>

37
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:05,457
<i>I love you, Miss Spencer.</i>

38
00:04:05,523 --> 00:04:08,751
<i>I love everything about you:</i>

39
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:13,586
<i>the way you walk, your sweet smile,</i>
<i>your easy grace and charm.</i>

40
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:17,488
Wimpy Burgers twice, one M.R.,
one well, heavy on the onions.

41
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:21,081
<i>I wish I could take you away</i>
<i>from all this.</i>

42
00:04:21,157 --> 00:04:23,560
<i>I'd like us to start</i>
<i>a new life together.</i>

43
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,086
<i>A little house of our own, a car,</i>
<i>the two of us against the world,</i>

44
00:04:28,157 --> 00:04:30,952
<i>joined forevermore</i>
<i>in holy wedlock.</i>

45
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,000
-Miss Spencer!
-What?

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,250
Nothing.

47
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,260
Good evening.

48
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,200
I couldn't help noticing that you were
making an unsuccessful suicide bid.

49
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,260
What are you doing in my room?
What do you want?

50
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,486
I'm here to help you, Mr. Moon.

51
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:35,560
-I don't want any help. Please go away.
-Oh, all right.

52
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,086
I just thought you might be interested
in a little matter of a million pounds.

53
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:40,747
A million pounds?

54
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:46,655
Don't let me interfere with
your doing away with yourself.

55
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:48,260
What's this about a million pounds?

56
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,060
-May I come in?
-Yes, please do.

57
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,815
Thank you. I wonder
if you'd mind taking my cloak.

58
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,200
Hang it somewhere dry,
would you?

59
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:01,115
-Might I sit down?
-Oh, do.

60
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:02,060
Thank you.

61
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,700
It's a very nasty little place
you've got here.

62
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,260
Oh. Thank you.
What's this about a million pounds?

63
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,560
Oh, a million pounds, yes.

64
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,614
You remember
your great-great-great-grandfather?

65
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,464
-Well, I never even met my father.
-How very sad.

66
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:17,979
Excuse me.

67
00:06:20,257 --> 00:06:23,689
In all events, your great-great-great-
grandfather, Ephraim Moon,

68
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:26,689
sailed for Australia in 1782
on a ship of the line.

69
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:29,053
Set himself up as an apothecary.

70
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:31,160
The business flourished
and by the time he died

71
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,056
it was worth something
in the region of £2,000.

72
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:36,386
-A large amount in those days.
-Yes.

73
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:38,760
Your great-great-grandfather,
Cedric Moon,

74
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,260
by skillful management
and careful husbandry

75
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,390
increased that sum
a hundredfold.

76
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:47,049
This, in turn, was inherited
by your great-grandfather, Desmond Moon,

77
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:49,386
who expanded,
diversified

78
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:54,549
and built up a personal fortune
of well over a million pounds.

79
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,453
Oh. That's a lot of money.

80
00:06:56,523 --> 00:06:59,251
A great deal of money, Mr. Moon.

81
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:01,881
And this gigantic sum

82
00:07:01,957 --> 00:07:05,219
was inherited by your grandfather,
Hubert Moon,

83
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:09,053
who returned to London and frittered it away
on wine, women and loose living.

84
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:13,560
Where does that leave me,
then?

85
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,000
Penniless and
on the brink of suicide.

86
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,860
You get out of here
before I call the police.

87
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,700
-Before you call the what?
-The police.

88
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,622
You realise that suicide
is a criminal offence.

89
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,500
In less enlightened times
they'd have hung you for it.

90
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,360
Look, exactly what do you want?

91
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,460
I told you. Seriously,
I want to help you.

92
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,660
Unburden yourself. It does you good
to share your problems.

93
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,660
What interest is it to you?

94
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,960
Please, go away!

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,017
I'm interested in everybody.

96
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:51,216
Please tell me. What drove you
to this desperate act?

97
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,722
All right, I'll tell you.
I'm miserable.

98
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,722
I've got a boring job,
no money, no prospects.

99
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,060
I haven't got a girlfriend,
I can't get to know anyone,

100
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,223
no one wants to get to know me
and everything is hopeless.

101
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,223
All right? Satisfied?

102
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,314
And if you really want to help me,
you can get me a sock for this pipe.

103
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:11,800
-Oh, yes. They're in the top
left-hand drawer, aren't they?  -Yeah.

104
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,060
But suicide, Mr. Moon?
Really, really, really.

105
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,156
That's the last thing
you should do.

106
00:08:18,224 --> 00:08:21,156
Don't you think
it's taking the easy way out?

107
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:23,156
Easy way out?

108
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:25,156
What's easy about it?

109
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:27,655
Look, the bleedin' pipe's broken.

110
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,656
Can't even manage to kill myself.

111
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:32,656
Let's face it, Mr. Moon,
you're a complete failure.

112
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:34,400
Yes.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,056
I'll fix that.

114
00:08:37,124 --> 00:08:39,715
You know that million pounds
I mentioned?

115
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,722
I wasn't joking.

116
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,949
I could give you that
and more.

117
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,360
Everything you've ever seen
in the advertisements:

118
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,260
fast, white convertibles,

119
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,456
blonde women,
their hair trailing in the wind,

120
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:53,456
wafer-thin after-dinner chocolates.

121
00:08:53,523 --> 00:08:56,060
If you had all that,
would you be any happier?

122
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,960
What are you on about?

123
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,188
Would the words "Prince of Darkness"
mean anything to you?

124
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:04,155
Beelzebub? Mephistopheles?
The horned one?

125
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,290
I know.
You've escaped from somewhere.

126
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:10,060
No, I haven't, Mr. Moon.

127
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,085
I'm the horned one, the devil.
Let me give you my card.

128
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:21,400
Oh, yes, the devil. Of course.
Silly old me.

129
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,519
Cor blimey!
I left my hankie at Wimpy's.

130
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,750
-I wonder if you'll excuse me.
-Don't rush away, Mr. Moon.

131
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:30,120
You're a nutcase.
You're a bleedin' nutcase.

132
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:32,660
They said the same of Jesus Christ,
Freud and Galileo.

133
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,956
They said it
of a lot of nutcases too.

134
00:09:35,024 --> 00:09:37,956
You're not as stupid as you look,
are you, Mr. Moon?

135
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:41,184
What can I do to convince you
that I'm the devil?

136
00:09:41,257 --> 00:09:44,189
Supposing I granted you
your dearest wish here and now.

137
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:46,382
What about that girl at Wimpy's?

138
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,750
Margaret Spencer?

139
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,083
Yes.

140
00:09:49,157 --> 00:09:51,089
How do you know about her?

141
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,060
And how do you know
so much about me,

142
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,589
where my socks are
and who my grandfather was?

143
00:09:55,657 --> 00:09:58,283
I told you.
I've been taking an interest in you.

144
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:01,085
Look, well, supposing I

145
00:10:01,157 --> 00:10:02,760
gave you a trial wish.

146
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,460
No obligation on your part.
Just to get acquainted.

147
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,419
Is there anything in the world
you really desire?

148
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,457
-Margaret Spencer.
-Aside from Margaret Spencer.

149
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:13,115
We'll save her till later,
when you sign. Anything else?

150
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,623
A Frobisher and Gleason
raspberry-flavoured ice lolly.

151
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,260
Very well, Mr. Moon.

152
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,986
Conclusively to prove that
I am indeed the unholy one

153
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:25,716
a Frobisher and Gleason
raspberry-flavoured ice lolly

154
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,722
shall be yours

155
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,960
in a trice.

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,400
-[Snaps fingers]
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

157
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,000
Have you got sixpence?
I've only got a million-pound note.

158
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:46,256
-Thank you.
-Ta.

159
00:10:46,324 --> 00:10:48,812
-Convinced?
-Do me a favour.

160
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,660
I could have done that myself.

161
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,879
I thought you were gonna
conjure it up.

162
00:10:52,957 --> 00:10:56,548
You're just like all the rest, aren't you?
No proof is good enough.

163
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:58,646
I want a miracle.

164
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,656
A rain of toads or something.

165
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:04,157
All right then.
Which of the cheap tricks is it gonna be?

166
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:06,655
Wine into water?
Stick into serpent?

167
00:11:06,724 --> 00:11:09,554
How about flying through space
at the speed of light?

168
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:13,147
How about you checking in to the nearest
loony bin for a few weeks' holiday?

169
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:15,655
O ye of little faith, Moon.

170
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:18,054
You're not wearing
nylon underwear, are you?

171
00:11:18,124 --> 00:11:20,460
-Why?
-It disintegrates at high speeds.

172
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,160
Prepare yourself.

173
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,486
The magic words: L B J.

174
00:11:26,623 --> 00:11:28,885
Here, my ice lolly's melted.

175
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,060
You really must be the devil.

176
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,000
-Incarnate. How do you do?
-Oh. How do you do?

177
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,713
Where are we? Is this hell?

178
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,585
Just my London headquarters.

179
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,560
That's not your name, is it?

180
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,000
George Spiggott?

181
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,260
Come on in. It's one of my many earthly
pseudoplumes, or nom de nyms.

182
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,960
I thought you were called Lucifer.

183
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,456
I know. The Bringer of the Light,
it used to be.

184
00:11:59,523 --> 00:12:01,060
Sounded a bit puffy to me.

185
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,960
God keeps changing his name too,
you know.

186
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,460
He used to be called "the Word".

187
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,560
-Yeah. "In the beginning was the Word".
-"And the Word was God".

188
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,060
Was there just a word
hanging about in space then?

189
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,960
I suppose so.
I wasn't there.

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,951
-What's it mean,"the Word"?
-What does "Stanley Moon" mean?

191
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:18,013
Evening, Anger.

192
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,300
It's all right, Anger.
He's with me.

193
00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:27,300
Come in, Mr. Moon.

194
00:12:27,623 --> 00:12:30,555
I'd like you to meet Anger.
He works for me.

195
00:12:30,623 --> 00:12:32,660
How do you do?
Pleased to meet you.

196
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,500
Watch it, that's all.

197
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,860
This is the Club Room.

198
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,887
It's quite nicely decorated
and painted. Early Hitler.

199
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:45,889
Now, what about
my little proposition?

200
00:12:45,957 --> 00:12:49,287
All I want from you is something
you probably don't even realise you have.

201
00:12:49,358 --> 00:12:51,290
I'm talking about your soul.

202
00:12:51,358 --> 00:12:53,290
-My soul?
-Yes.

203
00:12:53,358 --> 00:12:55,290
Like you collect moths,

204
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,290
I collect souls.

205
00:12:57,358 --> 00:13:00,000
I'd like to add yours
to my collection.

206
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,222
-What are you doing?
-Just a bit of routine mischief.

207
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,257
Now then,
what about your soul?

208
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:09,653
Well, I don't know where it is
or how to get hold of it.

209
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:11,000
Exactly.

210
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,781
And all I want from you is the exclusive
global and universal rights to it.

211
00:13:16,924 --> 00:13:19,083
But if you took it out,
wouldn't it hurt?

212
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:21,089
It's a painless operation.

213
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:23,554
And afterwards,
you won't feel a thing.

214
00:13:23,623 --> 00:13:25,646
Besides, it's been
no earthly good to you, has it?

215
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:27,486
-Like to look at the contract?
-Yes, please.

216
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,160
There we are.

217
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,149
Your soul's rather like your appendix:
totally expendable.

218
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:35,560
There was a time
when it did have a function

219
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,157
but nowadays the vast majority
of people never use it.

220
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:42,655
Looks a bit complicated.

221
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:44,656
It's a standard contract.

222
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,656
Gives you seven wishes in accordance
with the mystic rules of life:

223
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:52,157
seven days of the week, seven deadly sins,
seven seas, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers...

224
00:13:52,224 --> 00:13:53,560
Look, if you're not interested,

225
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,213
I'm sure there's thousands of others
who'd jump at the opportunity.

226
00:13:58,358 --> 00:14:00,483
No, it's just a bit sudden,
that's all.

227
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:03,100
Read it through
on your own time.

228
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,460
"I, Stanley Moon,

229
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,249
hereinafter and in the hereafter
to be known as 'the damned'"

230
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:15,778
-The damned?
-It's a form of words. Legal jargon.

231
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:20,788
"Do warrant that
I am the sole owner of my soul."

232
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:26,385
But what about Margaret? Do you promise
that I'll have her all to myself?

233
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,447
Sign that

234
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,321
and Margaret Spencer

235
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:33,254
will be yours.

236
00:14:33,324 --> 00:14:37,517
"Dear Miss Spencer,
this is just to say cheerio.

237
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,386
"Yours sincerely, Stanley Moon.

238
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:44,651
P.S.
I leave you my collection of moths."

239
00:14:44,724 --> 00:14:47,156
Just how well
did you know Mr. Moon?

240
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:50,156
Not at all, really.
I used to see him at Wimpy's.

241
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:53,656
Well, it does seem that, of all the people
in his life, you were the closest to him.

242
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:57,248
-Why else would he leave you that note?
-I suppose that must be true.

243
00:14:57,324 --> 00:14:59,915
How awful.

244
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,388
Have you any idea why
he contemplated this rash act?

245
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,390
Can't say, really.

246
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,390
At work he always seems
so calm and quiet.

247
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,390
Sorry to be so blunt,
Miss Spencer,

248
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:14,413
but are you sure you're not concealing
your relationship with the would-be deceased?

249
00:15:14,491 --> 00:15:17,945
Wasn't a relationship.
I scarcely knew the man.

250
00:15:19,557 --> 00:15:22,217
What are you doing
all that measuring for?

251
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:25,382
Eh? Oh, we always do this,
Miss Spencer.

252
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,424
You'd be amazed
how often it pays off.

253
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:30,423
Now, did you say anything
that might have upset him?

254
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:32,888
Can you remember
your exact last words to him?

255
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:35,219
I think it was

256
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:39,950
"Wimpy Burgers twice, one M.R.,
one well, heavy on the onions."

257
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:42,819
Yes, I think I'm beginning
to get the picture.

258
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:47,589
-It all seems to be quite straightforward.
-Good.

259
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:50,851
All we need do now, then,
is get it witnessed.

260
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:54,889
Sloth would be best.
He's a lawyer.

261
00:16:00,857 --> 00:16:04,755
Come on now, Sloth!
Wake up, you idle, great slob!

262
00:16:04,824 --> 00:16:06,756
Here, are all your staff like this?

263
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:09,756
That's the trouble.
I can't get any decent help these days.

264
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:11,660
God's laughing, of course.

265
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,960
All he has to do
is raise his little finger,

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,400
he's got a thousand sycophantic,
prissy angels at his beck and call.

267
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,987
I'm lumbered with Anger and Sloth.

268
00:16:21,057 --> 00:16:24,148
Wake up, you lazy, legal layabout!

269
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:26,815
Get up! Wake up!

270
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:32,220
Here, well,
this is Stanley Moon.

271
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:36,223
He is selling me his soul, and I want you
to witness it on this document.

272
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,223
I want you to do some writing.

273
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,416
That's your forte, isn't it? Writing.

274
00:16:40,492 --> 00:16:43,424
Where it says,"In the presence of,"
your signature.

275
00:16:43,492 --> 00:16:45,600
-Your name. Remember that one?
-Yeah.

276
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,600
Sloth.

277
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:51,056
S, L,

278
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,319
O, T,

279
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:56,660
T, H.

280
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,018
Right. Very nice.
Now it's your turn.

281
00:17:02,425 --> 00:17:04,357
There's just one thing, though.

282
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:06,560
-You're not having second thoughts, are you?
-No.

283
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,360
-But shouldn't I sign in blood?
-Blimey, you are a traditionalist.

284
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,324
All right then.

285
00:17:12,392 --> 00:17:14,449
Let's use some of his.
He'll never notice.

286
00:17:16,158 --> 00:17:18,147
There we are. Help yourself.

287
00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:29,100
Well done.
Welcome to the club.

288
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,547
-When can I get started on my wishes?
-As soon as you like.

289
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:37,160
And if, by any chance,
you become dissatisfied,

290
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,789
all you have to do is go—

291
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:40,883
Just go— ?

292
00:17:40,923 --> 00:17:41,949
You just go—

293
00:17:42,024 --> 00:17:45,218
This'll terminate your wish
and bring you back to me, wherever I am.

294
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:47,223
Here we are. "M."

295
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,223
Let's see.

296
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:53,223
Machiavelli, McCarthy,
Masoch, Miller, Moses...

297
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,813
-Moses?
-Irving Moses, the fruiterer.

298
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,221
Here's Moon. S. Moon.

299
00:17:59,724 --> 00:18:01,587
That's you filed away.

300
00:18:01,657 --> 00:18:04,589
Now then, what would you like to be first?
Prime minister?

301
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:07,453
Oh, no, I've made that deal already.

302
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:10,218
I don't know, really.

303
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:13,223
It's just that I'm not
very good with words.

304
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:16,654
I didn't have very much
of an education.

305
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:19,519
And I'm a bit...

306
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:24,690
I'm just a bit...

307
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:26,500
Inarticulate.

308
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,182
Yes, that's it. I think.

309
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:32,690
And you'd like to be the sort of person
who can use words like "inarticulate"?

310
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:37,316
Yeah! I'd like to be able to talk
to Margaret and tell her how I feel.

311
00:18:37,392 --> 00:18:40,017
An intellectual who can get
his ideas across to the one he loves.

312
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:42,057
-Yes, that's it.
-Easily done.

313
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:45,057
Now then, you just stand
over here by the bird,

314
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,784
put your right hand
on its left claw.

315
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:50,290
Okay, lights out!

316
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,518
Take this!

317
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,523
Am I gonna explode?

318
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:58,319
No, no, it's quite safe. I just put it there
for a bit of visual excitement.

319
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:01,119
-It's not gonna hurt, is it?
-Not a bit.

320
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:03,180
Hold tight!

321
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:05,686
The magic words:

322
00:19:05,758 --> 00:19:07,600
Julie Andrews.

323
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:10,823
I could stand
and watch them for hours.

324
00:19:10,891 --> 00:19:12,880
They've such beautiful hands.

325
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:15,390
Such fantastic delicacy, you see.

326
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:20,719
But combined as well
with this almost preternatural strength.

327
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,587
Doesn't it make you sad
to see animals caged up like this?

328
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:27,690
Well, in a way, but...

329
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:30,690
quite honestly, they're really
no worse off than most of us.

330
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:32,690
How do you mean?

331
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:35,190
Well, metaphorically speaking,

332
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:39,190
and in a very real sense,
society creates its own cages.

333
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:41,190
You know, cages of the mind.

334
00:19:41,258 --> 00:19:42,960
Yes. Yes.

335
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,190
A curious kind of cerebral captivity.

336
00:19:45,258 --> 00:19:47,190
Buy a flower, madam?

337
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:50,781
-Oh! What's it for?
-Depraved criminals.

338
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:56,517
You see, civilisation
has had the effect of

339
00:19:56,591 --> 00:20:01,057
inhibiting our deepest,
natural animal instincts, you see.

340
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,250
The conventions of an ordered society

341
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:09,814
have made us lose what Freud calls
our Urmenschgefühlnaturlichkeit.

342
00:20:09,891 --> 00:20:12,550
Well, it's a bit of a mouthful,
isn't it?

343
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:15,056
Must have been a marvellous man.

344
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,818
Oh, yes. One of the seminal forces.

345
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:22,323
As Rousseau said,
we must learn to unlearn

346
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:27,324
because only by unlearning
can we really learn to be.

347
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,187
Your ideas are so exciting!

348
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:35,400
What a fabulous room!

349
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,760
It's marvellous!

350
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,616
-Do you like it?
-Oh, I love it.

351
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:41,623
It's so right.

352
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:43,623
I mean, it's you!

353
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:46,885
The moment I walked in,
everything about it says "Stanley".

354
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,890
-Well...
-This room is you.

355
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,390
It's a bit untidy,
bit of a mess

356
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:54,514
but we bachelors have to fend
for ourselves, you know.

357
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:59,023
Brahms! I can't believe it!
You too?

358
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,700
Absolutely adore him.

359
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,456
He has a virile romanticism
that I find irresistible.

360
00:21:07,524 --> 00:21:10,957
Oh, Brahms is just so fantastic!

361
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:12,956
Whenever I feel tense or anything

362
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:17,013
I put him on, just sprawl on the carpet
and let him flow all over me.

363
00:21:17,091 --> 00:21:19,852
-Would you like a little taste of him now then?
-Please!

364
00:21:19,924 --> 00:21:21,856
Not that I'm tense
or anything.

365
00:21:21,924 --> 00:21:24,900
It's just that it would
make me even less tense.

366
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:44,347
Go on.

367
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:48,381
Lie down.

368
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,014
Oh, I didn't mean—

369
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:54,324
Let it happen.

370
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:23,354
I love the way
he brings the flute in there.

371
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,856
That is a French horn, actually.

372
00:22:25,924 --> 00:22:27,856
Oh. How silly of me.

373
00:22:27,924 --> 00:22:30,356
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Goodness gracious.

374
00:22:30,425 --> 00:22:33,686
The French horn can sound
incredibly like a flute, you know.

375
00:22:33,758 --> 00:22:38,500
In fact, not many people notice
the flute-like qualities of a French horn.

376
00:22:41,657 --> 00:22:44,800
It's so sensual and evocative.

377
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,300
One can almost see the trees
and the sunlight dappling through.

378
00:22:50,657 --> 00:22:52,589
And a little brook.

379
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,589
And what's that?

380
00:22:56,657 --> 00:22:58,589
A powerful, young stag

381
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:00,520
darts into the clearing,

382
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:02,921
raises his antlers

383
00:23:02,991 --> 00:23:05,500
and edges closer to his doe.

384
00:23:07,492 --> 00:23:10,424
Oh, that record was new this morning.

385
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:17,889
Where did you get that fantastic thing?

386
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,890
It is nice, isn't it?

387
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh, it's beautiful.

388
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,890
I got it off a stall, actually.

389
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:29,391
Just saw it there and had to have it.

390
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:31,260
I'm rather like that, you know.

391
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,390
I see something I want
and that's it, boy-o.

392
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,390
-Have to have it.
-Me too.

393
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,117
Yes, you too.

394
00:23:43,492 --> 00:23:45,923
-Have a look at it.
-Oh, thank you.

395
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,150
Bit of a weight, isn't it?

396
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, it's so smooth and cool.

397
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:54,453
Yes, that's the extraordinary thing
about marble.

398
00:23:54,524 --> 00:23:58,457
It's always 11 degrees cooler
than the air that surrounds it.

399
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,457
Fahrenheit, of course.

400
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,780
Do you like feeling things?

401
00:24:06,158 --> 00:24:09,386
Oh, yes,
I'm a very tactile person.

402
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,390
I love touching things.

403
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:13,260
Sometimes

404
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:17,060
I go into the forest
and shut my eyes

405
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,981
and just wander around touching trees
and grass and boulders.

406
00:24:22,058 --> 00:24:23,460
Y-You should try it.

407
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,317
Do it in here!
Go on. Shut your eyes.

408
00:24:33,358 --> 00:24:35,347
Now feel something hard.

409
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:44,449
Oh, I'm feeling something terribly hard.
It's fantastic.

410
00:24:46,024 --> 00:24:48,649
Oh, now feel something soft.

411
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:54,049
Oh, my goodness, gracious me.

412
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,114
Oh, it's unbelievable.

413
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:00,654
Oh, the contrast.

414
00:25:00,724 --> 00:25:03,656
I've never felt anything
so exciting in my life.

415
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:07,350
Yeah. I love it. Feel my tie.

416
00:25:15,924 --> 00:25:18,200
Oh. It's delicious!

417
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,760
It's Velvet, it's so wild.

418
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,000
It really does something to me.

419
00:25:28,524 --> 00:25:31,752
I suppose after all that touching
you could do with something to drink.

420
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:33,756
-Please.
-What would you like?

421
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,222
-Cinzano.
-Cinzano? Fantastic.

422
00:25:38,158 --> 00:25:41,700
One sip of Cinzano,
and I'm in Italy.

423
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:46,523
The freedom of it.

424
00:25:46,591 --> 00:25:49,023
The sun beating down.

425
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:53,023
The incredible thing about the Italians
is the way they touch each other.

426
00:25:53,091 --> 00:25:55,648
-Have you noticed that?
-Yes. Cheers.

427
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:01,455
The Anglo-Saxons have lost the art
of touching each other.

428
00:26:01,524 --> 00:26:04,457
I mean, if someone wants
to touch somebody else

429
00:26:04,524 --> 00:26:07,457
then they should go right ahead
and touch them.

430
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,457
I mean, it's a healthy,
human thing to do.

431
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:12,457
You're so right.

432
00:26:12,524 --> 00:26:15,286
There's a tribe in Africa
who never say a word.

433
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:18,119
They just touch each other.
That's how they communicate.

434
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:20,123
Life is far too complicated.

435
00:26:20,191 --> 00:26:22,782
I think we should get down
to basic elements.

436
00:26:22,858 --> 00:26:24,551
I mean—

437
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:28,489
For example,
if you were a girl, and I—

438
00:26:28,557 --> 00:26:31,614
-I am a girl.
-Well, of course!

439
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,619
All right,
but if you were a girl,

440
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:39,680
which, of course, you are,

441
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:45,486
and if I were a man, which,
for argument's sake, let's say I am,

442
00:26:45,557 --> 00:26:49,046
and I wanted to touch you, well...

443
00:26:49,125 --> 00:26:51,057
I wouldn't feel restrained.

444
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,057
I mean, I'd just go right ahead

445
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,182
and

446
00:26:55,258 --> 00:26:57,190
touch you.

447
00:26:57,258 --> 00:26:59,190
You see? That's how I am.

448
00:26:59,258 --> 00:27:01,121
I feel the same way.

449
00:27:01,191 --> 00:27:04,123
I mean, if two adult human beings
want to touch each other

450
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:07,089
they should go ahead
and touch each other.

451
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:09,147
-Why hold back?
-Yes.

452
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:13,690
This afternoon has been

453
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,690
so perfect.

454
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:17,452
The Cinzano. The zoo.

455
00:27:17,524 --> 00:27:20,150
The music. The touching.

456
00:27:20,225 --> 00:27:22,656
And you're so right
about the animals.

457
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,883
I mean, that's what we are

458
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:28,288
deep down, underneath
our sophisticated civilisation

459
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:30,789
and we should behave
like they do.

460
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,790
Of course.

461
00:27:32,858 --> 00:27:34,790
I mean, the fact that it's

462
00:27:34,858 --> 00:27:39,052
seven minutes past 3 in the afternoon
wouldn't make any difference to a goat.

463
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:42,852
I mean, Old Billy wouldn't stop to think
what time of day it was, would he?

464
00:27:42,924 --> 00:27:45,890
No, it just goes right ahead
and does what it feels like.

465
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,788
I mean, really,
what are people waiting for?

466
00:27:48,858 --> 00:27:51,256
I want to live!
That's what matters, living.

467
00:27:51,325 --> 00:27:53,620
I want to do everything,
be everything,

468
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:55,623
feel everything!

469
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:57,623
Rape! Rape!

470
00:27:57,691 --> 00:27:59,554
No, no! Margaret! Margaret!

471
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:02,056
The animals! The goats!
The touching!

472
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:04,057
Rape! Rape! Rape!

473
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:06,522
What's going on in there?
Open the door!

474
00:28:12,591 --> 00:28:14,784
Rape! Aah!

475
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:19,121
Hello, Stanley.
I won't be a minute.

476
00:28:19,191 --> 00:28:20,760
Get me down from here.

477
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,180
You're quite safe.
It's only a 300-foot drop.

478
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:27,518
What am I doing
in this costume?

479
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:30,114
I thought you ought
to dress for the occasion.

480
00:28:30,191 --> 00:28:32,952
Come on, my darling.
Out you come.

481
00:28:33,024 --> 00:28:35,990
There we are.

482
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:39,024
-What did you say?
-I just said—

483
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:40,060
What's that mean?

484
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,057
It's pigeon talk.
I'm just issuing instructions.

485
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:45,522
I'm going for a double tempt, actually.
Like to come and watch?

486
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,600
Come over here.

487
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,160
No need to be frightened.
You won't fall.

488
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,457
I'll hold on to your belt,
if you like.

489
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,300
Up you come.

490
00:28:56,058 --> 00:28:57,990
There we are.

491
00:28:58,058 --> 00:29:01,388
-Now, you see that man over there?
-Yes.

492
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:02,889
-And do you see this pigeon?
-Yes.

493
00:29:02,958 --> 00:29:05,390
Well, this is a classic
double tempt situation.

494
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,889
With a bit of luck,
I can get two sins for the price of one—

495
00:29:07,958 --> 00:29:10,856
spite from the perpetrating pigeon
and anger from the victim!

496
00:29:10,924 --> 00:29:12,356
It's terrific!

497
00:29:12,425 --> 00:29:14,856
Are you trying to tell me
you want that pigeon

498
00:29:14,924 --> 00:29:16,856
to do his doo-dahs
on that man's head?

499
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,856
That's right.

500
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,856
All right, birdie,
remember what I said.

501
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:22,856
Target in range.

502
00:29:22,924 --> 00:29:25,515
All systems... go!

503
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:29,523
Release your doo-dahs.

504
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:36,457
What a pathetic thing to do.

505
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,684
If you're the devil, why didn't you
go for that vicar down there?

506
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:42,190
Oh, no. He's one of ours.

507
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:44,587
Is this your idea of having fun?

508
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,714
Tempting pigeons?

509
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:50,121
Banal as it may seem, Stanley,
it is my job.

510
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,622
I don't know.

511
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,021
If it hadn't been for you,

512
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:59,183
we'd still be blissfully wandering about
naked in paradise.

513
00:29:59,258 --> 00:30:00,400
You're welcome, mate.

514
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,315
The Garden of Eden was a boggy swamp just
south of Croydon. You can see it over there.

515
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,857
Adam and Eve
were happy enough.

516
00:30:06,924 --> 00:30:09,100
I'll tell you why:
they were pig ignorant.

517
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,690
Come on, my darling. Out you go,
and do something really nasty.

518
00:30:13,758 --> 00:30:16,190
Oh, how'd you get on
with Margaret Spencer?

519
00:30:16,258 --> 00:30:19,190
I was wondering
when you'd ask me that.

520
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:22,190
It was terrible.
I was so frustrated.

521
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:24,689
I had all these
words and ideas

522
00:30:24,758 --> 00:30:27,054
and she listened to them
and agreed with them

523
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,057
but when I touched her
she screamed.

524
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,057
Let me tell you something,
Stanley.

525
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:33,989
As far as sex is concerned,
patience is a virtue.

526
00:30:34,058 --> 00:30:36,183
I wanted her so much
I just couldn't wait.

527
00:30:36,258 --> 00:30:38,000
Let me give you a tip.
Come here.

528
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,350
In the words of
Marcel Proust,

529
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,660
and this applies
to any woman in the world,

530
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,760
if you can stay up and listen
with a fair degree of attention

531
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,360
to whatever garbage,
no matter how stupid it is,

532
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,260
that they're coming out with,

533
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,832
till 10 minutes past 4
in the morning, you're in.

534
00:30:54,965 --> 00:30:57,931
Ten minutes past 4 in the morning
and you're there?

535
00:30:57,999 --> 00:30:59,521
It never fails.

536
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,562
Oh, that Margaret's
such a gorgeous girl.

537
00:31:03,632 --> 00:31:05,121
Isn't she lovely?

538
00:31:05,199 --> 00:31:07,756
I'd like to know
what she's doing right now.

539
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,600
Well, that can be arranged.

540
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:11,960
Let's just get this out.

541
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,031
-What's that?
-Galileo's wonderful little invention.

542
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:17,088
Have you got a sixpence?

543
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:19,800
Yes.

544
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,488
Have a peer through that.

545
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,060
-There we are.
-Wha—

546
00:31:27,132 --> 00:31:30,564
Come on, Roberts.
Put your back into it!

547
00:31:30,632 --> 00:31:33,564
It's very good of you
to spend so much time on this.

548
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,564
Shh. Oh, that's why we're here,
Miss Spencer. To help people out.

549
00:31:36,632 --> 00:31:39,064
Or fish people out, rather.

550
00:31:39,132 --> 00:31:41,064
Excuse me, Miss Spencer.

551
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:44,064
People get the wrong idea
about the police.

552
00:31:44,132 --> 00:31:46,723
We're all human beings as well,
you know.

553
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,731
No, we like the public
to think of us as their friends.

554
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,731
I'm sure we all do, Inspector.

555
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,231
Why don't you call me Reg?

556
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:58,628
All right, Reg.
And you must call me Margaret.

557
00:31:58,698 --> 00:32:00,891
Here, she told him
to call her Margaret.

558
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:04,398
-I think she fancies him a bit.
-Shut up!

559
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:07,000
Oh, I do hope they don't
find Stanley down there.

560
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,900
He was such a—

561
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:12,530
Quick, it's run out!
Give me another sixpence.

562
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,587
I haven't got one!

563
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:19,529
Oh, I know she was gonna say
something nice about me.

564
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:22,429
Oh, let me have her now.
I must have her now. Please!

565
00:32:22,499 --> 00:32:25,226
Just tell me who, where, when,
under what circumstances.

566
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,900
Margaret is who,
of course,

567
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,660
but I don't want to go through all that
courting business again, that was awful.

568
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,962
Why not be married to her? Then
you'll be absolutely certain of having her.

569
00:32:33,032 --> 00:32:36,623
Yeah. And I'd like to be powerful,
'cause I'd like to give her lots of things.

570
00:32:36,698 --> 00:32:38,630
Rich. Influential. Millionaire.

571
00:32:38,698 --> 00:32:40,630
-Multi.
-Multi. Good thinking.

572
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:45,028
Multimillionaire. Yachts, servants,
country estates, a phone in the lav.

573
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:48,660
Yeah, but I don't want her to be
like she was last time, you know, timid.

574
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,463
I want her to be physical.

575
00:32:51,532 --> 00:32:54,560
I'll make her very physical, indeed,
for you, Stanley.

576
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,000
Stiffen yourself.

577
00:32:57,532 --> 00:33:00,300
The magic words: Jackie Kennedy!

578
00:33:03,199 --> 00:33:05,062
Oh, well. Julie Andrews.

579
00:33:14,598 --> 00:33:16,587
Randy!

580
00:33:17,665 --> 00:33:19,597
Afternoon, Seed.

581
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:23,189
Hello, everybody. How are you, Peter?
Sorry I'm late, darling.

582
00:33:23,266 --> 00:33:25,198
-Hello, Randolph.
-Hello.

583
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:28,198
Brought you a little something
from town.

584
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:30,198
Do you like it?

585
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:33,891
-Yes. Isn't it lovely, Randy?
-Yes.

586
00:33:34,965 --> 00:33:36,897
We are playing croquet.

587
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:41,400
Why don't you and Peter go away
and discuss your affairs?

588
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,360
True enough.

589
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,860
I suppose we ought to
tie up this Venezuelan business.

590
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,360
Yes.

591
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,061
Lord Dowdy, I wonder if you'd be
so kind as to take over my blue ball

592
00:33:52,132 --> 00:33:53,893
and double up with Daphne.

593
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,897
Certainly.

594
00:33:55,965 --> 00:33:57,960
Who is that young Randy fellow?

595
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,897
What?

596
00:33:58,965 --> 00:34:00,828
Oh. Randolph.

597
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:02,831
He's an awfully nice chap.

598
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:06,400
-He is teaching Margaret the harp.
-Oh, yes.

599
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,160
-She's terribly artistic, you know.
-Is she?

600
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,331
-Yes. Terribly.
-Artistic?

601
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,331
-Yes. Yes.
-Yes.

602
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,331
We met Randolph, actually,
when we were in the Bahamas

603
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,830
forming Margaret's mother
into a limited company.

604
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,831
Very shrewd move.

605
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:24,831
You ever thought of making Margaret
into a charitable institution?

606
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:26,831
What a cracking wheeze!

607
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,331
Yes, and then I could get
a depreciation allowance on her.

608
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,830
Exactly. I think the revenue boys
would buy that one.

609
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:32,800
Yes.

610
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,092
You could probably get
her clothes taken off as well.

611
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:41,098
Yes, I'm sure
they'd be deductible.

612
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:46,800
-Properly handled, I think she could be
a wonderful little asset.  -Yes.

613
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,098
I was shopping around for a wife,
actually, the other day.

614
00:34:50,166 --> 00:34:52,098
Daphne?

615
00:34:52,166 --> 00:34:54,098
Or something along similar lines.

616
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,757
But my accountant said that
in my bracket it really wasn't on.

617
00:34:56,832 --> 00:34:59,424
Oh, yes. Come on!

618
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:03,263
Yes. Excuse me.

619
00:35:03,332 --> 00:35:06,264
I forgot to give you this,
my precious!

620
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:08,593
Oh, you doll!

621
00:35:08,665 --> 00:35:11,131
There we are. Do you like it?

622
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:13,131
Well!

623
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:15,562
-Feel the fur, Randolph.
-Beautiful.

624
00:35:15,632 --> 00:35:18,428
How is the old harp coming along?

625
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:20,431
Oh, splendidly.

626
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:22,465
Your wife has
extraordinary sensitivity.

627
00:35:22,532 --> 00:35:24,465
She has, she has. Extraordinary.

628
00:35:24,532 --> 00:35:27,397
Oh, I'm so hot and sticky.

629
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:30,455
Randy, we must have a dip!

630
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:44,559
Your wife has a very beautiful body.

631
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:49,193
It is nice, isn't it?

632
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:53,860
You must be a very happy man.

633
00:35:55,698 --> 00:35:57,960
Yes.

634
00:35:58,032 --> 00:35:59,964
Yes, I must be.

635
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:07,200
I find her fantastically attractive.

636
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,365
Thank you.

637
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,365
You don't mind my saying that.

638
00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:19,160
My dear chap. Good Lord.

639
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:21,391
Not at all. Not at all.

640
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:30,395
-I imagine everybody does.
-I imagine they do. Yes.

641
00:36:34,665 --> 00:36:37,597
Sex is a terribly thorny subject,
isn't it?

642
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:42,231
Terribly thorny.

643
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:44,231
Very thorny subject.

644
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:45,841
I don't really need it.

645
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:47,424
Yes, please.

646
00:36:47,499 --> 00:36:49,930
I always think it's very ironical

647
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:54,700
that the male of the species reaches
his sexual peak at the age of 14.

648
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,431
Whereas the appetite of the female

649
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:01,431
continues to increase
with the passing years.

650
00:37:02,665 --> 00:37:04,597
Yes.

651
00:37:06,665 --> 00:37:09,154
It is ironic, isn't it?

652
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:12,764
Bloody ironic.

653
00:37:16,466 --> 00:37:19,625
Of course, monogamy isn't
a natural state for any animal.

654
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:21,630
Good Lord, no.

655
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,630
Goodness gracious, no. No.

656
00:37:23,698 --> 00:37:26,630
-When I say "animal" I mean "man".
-Yes.

657
00:37:26,698 --> 00:37:29,630
-And when I say "man" I mean "woman", of course.
-Of course.

658
00:37:31,698 --> 00:37:36,630
You see, he —or,
for that matter, she— is

659
00:37:36,698 --> 00:37:38,755
fundamentally promiscuous.

660
00:37:38,832 --> 00:37:40,798
Now.

661
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:44,391
Yes.

662
00:37:44,466 --> 00:37:46,761
Yes, she probably is.

663
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,400
How does that feel?

664
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:52,731
Excuse me.

665
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:54,731
Darling! Darling!

666
00:37:54,799 --> 00:37:56,731
I forgot to give you this, dear heart.

667
00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:58,731
How exciting. What is it?

668
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:01,642
Boo-boo-boo-boo!

669
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:03,026
You shouldn't have.

670
00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:04,795
Is it the original?

671
00:38:04,835 --> 00:38:06,531
Yes. I thought it might appeal.

672
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:09,429
Thank you, dear. You are sweet.

673
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:11,431
Oh, good!

674
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:14,431
And now we must go
and get out of our wet things.

675
00:38:14,499 --> 00:38:17,589
Come along, Randy.

676
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:23,059
Beautiful collection of books
you've got here, Stanley.

677
00:38:23,132 --> 00:38:25,597
Must be worth a packet.

678
00:38:25,665 --> 00:38:28,597
Yes, I caught a rather nasty cold
in blue chips last week

679
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:32,189
and my broker's advised me
to switch to first editions.

680
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:34,027
They're going up all the time.

681
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,660
Yes.

682
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,622
That one's worth about £10 more
than it was when we came in.

683
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,063
Forgive my ignorance, Bagshot,

684
00:38:45,132 --> 00:38:48,064
but what are you in?

685
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,927
Missiles and munitions, mainly.

686
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:53,090
How's the market holding up?

687
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:57,598
Well, we've been very badly hit
by this peace scare.

688
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:01,229
We fell four points yesterday.

689
00:39:02,532 --> 00:39:06,794
Luckily, I managed to off-load
a lot of obsolete rubbish

690
00:39:06,865 --> 00:39:08,854
on the freedom fighters.

691
00:39:10,466 --> 00:39:12,795
Yet things still look
rather dodgy.

692
00:39:12,865 --> 00:39:15,558
Surely it's

693
00:39:15,632 --> 00:39:19,758
only a temporary

694
00:39:19,832 --> 00:39:22,730
setback.

695
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:26,232
That's very easy for you to say,
Lord Dowdy.

696
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:28,231
But it only takes two lunatics

697
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:30,730
to sit down
and sign a piece of paper

698
00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:34,425
and we could be plunged into
a nuclear peace so devastating

699
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:37,431
that my company, for one,
would be wiped out completely.

700
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,623
Where's that harp
coming from?

701
00:39:40,698 --> 00:39:43,664
It's probably Margaret
playing with Randolph

702
00:39:43,732 --> 00:39:46,062
in the music room.

703
00:39:46,132 --> 00:39:48,064
They're very good together,
aren't they?

704
00:39:48,132 --> 00:39:50,563
Yes, they certainly are.

705
00:39:50,632 --> 00:39:55,361
I often wish I'd been forced to take up
an instrument myself when I was young.

706
00:39:55,433 --> 00:40:00,365
I must say, I admire the way
you allow her such freedom.

707
00:40:00,433 --> 00:40:03,365
I think most husbands
would object to their wives

708
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:06,660
being alone in a room
with a handsome,

709
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:09,221
virile young man.

710
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:15,731
Well, it is the 20th century,
after all, old boy.

711
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:19,300
Can't expect to possess
anyone body and soul.

712
00:40:23,932 --> 00:40:25,864
Wonder why the

713
00:40:25,932 --> 00:40:27,864
music stopped.

714
00:40:27,932 --> 00:40:31,194
They've probably come to the end
of their first movement.

715
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,198
Your shot, Stanley.

716
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:35,198
Yes. Yes.

717
00:40:37,532 --> 00:40:41,965
I'll just pop along and

718
00:40:42,032 --> 00:40:44,964
see if they need anything before

719
00:40:45,032 --> 00:40:50,960
they start their next

720
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,600
movement.

721
00:40:59,088 --> 00:41:01,020
Hello, Randolph.

722
00:41:01,088 --> 00:41:04,020
Have you seen anything
of my wife at all?

723
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:06,519
Not recently.
I thought she was with you.

724
00:41:07,754 --> 00:41:10,186
Yes. Probably is. Probably is, yes.

725
00:41:11,188 --> 00:41:13,120
Yes.

726
00:41:13,188 --> 00:41:16,245
Probably... with—

727
00:41:16,322 --> 00:41:18,311
Probably with me.

728
00:41:22,055 --> 00:41:24,782
Oh. Where's Peter got to?

729
00:41:24,854 --> 00:41:27,718
He said

730
00:41:27,788 --> 00:41:31,720
something had come up.

731
00:41:31,788 --> 00:41:33,720
Come up?
Something come up? Yes.

732
00:41:33,788 --> 00:41:35,720
Your shot.

733
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:38,346
My shot. Yes. Yes, my shot.

734
00:41:38,422 --> 00:41:40,354
Yes, you're certainly right there.

735
00:41:40,422 --> 00:41:42,354
Gosh. My shot. Yes.

736
00:41:42,422 --> 00:41:44,354
Oh, blast!
Gosh.

737
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,260
Seem to have broken me cue.

738
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,020
Won't use any of those.
Rubbishy old things.

739
00:41:52,088 --> 00:41:54,519
I'll just go
and get my special one.

740
00:41:54,587 --> 00:41:58,315
Margaret'll know
where to lay her hands on it!

741
00:41:58,388 --> 00:42:01,252
Margaret, my darling! My precious!

742
00:42:01,322 --> 00:42:03,617
My sweet? My love? Margaret!

743
00:42:05,088 --> 00:42:07,020
-Seed!
-Sir?

744
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,418
Have you seen Lady Margaret, Seed?

745
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:13,060
Her Ladyship
is in the bathroom, sir.

746
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,800
In the bathroom, Seed.
Jolly good.

747
00:42:20,654 --> 00:42:22,711
Oh. Hello, Peter.
Hello, darling.

748
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:29,000
Sorry to butt in
like this, Peter, but...

749
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,945
about this Venezuelan business,

750
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:36,748
I thought we ought to get it
tied up one way or the other.

751
00:42:39,954 --> 00:42:42,886
Do you want me to come in
with you on it

752
00:42:42,954 --> 00:42:45,886
or do you wish to pull out

753
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:49,352
or shall we just
call the whole thing...

754
00:42:54,255 --> 00:42:57,187
Hello, Stanley.
Just tap this for me, would you?

755
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,700
-What are we doing up here?
-Trapping a few wasps.

756
00:42:59,854 --> 00:43:01,465
Wasps? Blimey!

757
00:43:01,505 --> 00:43:03,116
Come on, my darlings.

758
00:43:03,188 --> 00:43:06,620
Come on, my beastlies.
Out of the nest, into the jar. Come on.

759
00:43:06,688 --> 00:43:08,384
How'd it go, Stanley?

760
00:43:08,424 --> 00:43:10,121
You know perfectly well how it went.

761
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:13,120
That Bagshot bloke
looked exactly like you.

762
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:15,120
Well, there's a lot of me
in everyone.

763
00:43:15,188 --> 00:43:18,484
It was even worse than the last time.
I've never been so miserable.

764
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,000
Wasn't she physical enough?

765
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,487
She was physical, all right.

766
00:43:21,554 --> 00:43:23,487
She was too physical.

767
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:25,986
She was physical all over the place,
except with me.

768
00:43:26,055 --> 00:43:29,317
Oh, don't be too hard on her.
Fornication's such a puny sin.

769
00:43:29,388 --> 00:43:31,445
What she did to me
was unforgivable.

770
00:43:31,521 --> 00:43:34,960
You're just like all my clients.
Absolutely typical.

771
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,454
If Margaret had come in and told you
she'd murdered the gardener,

772
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:40,760
you'd have forgiven her,
shielded her from the police.

773
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,860
Just because she has a bit of harmless fun
with some young man

774
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,454
doesn't do anybody any damage...

775
00:43:45,521 --> 00:43:47,454
you want to strangle her.

776
00:43:47,521 --> 00:43:49,510
You're a complete hypocrite.

777
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:51,960
I thought you were
gonna make me happy.

778
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,519
I never promised you that.
That's up to you.

779
00:43:54,587 --> 00:43:57,678
I just gave you seven wishes
for one measly little soul.

780
00:43:57,754 --> 00:43:59,960
-I'm only doing my job.
-Your job?
-Shh!

781
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,817
Making people miserable?

782
00:44:01,888 --> 00:44:05,581
No! Giving them the chance
to be happy. It's God's idea.

783
00:44:06,654 --> 00:44:08,586
Don't confuse me
with religion.

784
00:44:08,654 --> 00:44:11,586
You see, his theory—
and I'm not knocking it—

785
00:44:11,654 --> 00:44:14,586
is that in order for people
to be really good,

786
00:44:14,654 --> 00:44:19,100
they have to make a free choice
between good and evil and choose good.

787
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,200
Look.

788
00:44:21,821 --> 00:44:25,015
I'm a vital part of his plan.
I provide the evil.

789
00:44:29,388 --> 00:44:31,320
Wasps!

790
00:44:31,388 --> 00:44:33,286
Wasps! Wasps!

791
00:44:35,355 --> 00:44:38,787
Oh, you rotten,
nasty-minded troublemaker.

792
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:44,060
Those nice, gentle flower people
grooving along quietly

793
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:46,000
and you had to come
and mess it up.

794
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,177
-You could do something about it.
-How?

795
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,800
Why don't you give them
one of your wishes?

796
00:44:53,322 --> 00:44:56,254
Well, because they're mine,
and I've only got five of them left.

797
00:44:56,322 --> 00:44:59,117
Not falling for any more of your tricks,
thank you very much.

798
00:44:59,188 --> 00:45:02,620
Well, just as you like.
Let's go. More work to be done.

799
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,560
What a dreary thing to do.
I hope you're proud of yourself.

800
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,653
It was pride
that got me into this.

801
00:45:11,721 --> 00:45:14,653
I used to be an angel,
you know, up in heaven.

802
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:17,260
Oh, yeah. You used to be
God's favourite, didn't you?

803
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,712
That's right.
"I love Lucifer" it was, in those days.

804
00:45:19,752 --> 00:45:21,744
What was it like in heaven?

805
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,878
Very nice, really.

806
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:26,579
We used to sit around all day
and adore him.

807
00:45:26,654 --> 00:45:28,560
Believe me,
he was adorable.

808
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,900
Just about the most adorable thing
you ever did see.

809
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,287
-Well, what went wrong then?
-I'll show you.

810
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,700
Here we are.
Give me a leg up, would you?

811
00:45:38,055 --> 00:45:39,987
Now, then...

812
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:41,987
I'm God.

813
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:43,760
This is my throne, you see?

814
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,987
All around me
are the cherubim, seraphim,

815
00:45:46,055 --> 00:45:47,987
continually crying,
"Holy, holy, holy",

816
00:45:48,055 --> 00:45:49,987
the angels, archangels,
that sort of thing.

817
00:45:50,055 --> 00:45:53,660
Now you be me, Lucifer,
the loveliest angel of them all.

818
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,760
What do I do?

819
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,860
Well, sort of dance around
praising me, mainly.

820
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,460
What sort of things
do I say?

821
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,960
Anything that comes
into your head that's nice.

822
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,613
How beautiful I am, how wise,
how handsome, that sort of thing.

823
00:46:03,688 --> 00:46:05,813
Come on. Start dancing.

824
00:46:07,422 --> 00:46:10,320
You're wise, you're beautiful.
You're handsome.

825
00:46:10,388 --> 00:46:12,320
Thank you very much.

826
00:46:12,388 --> 00:46:14,960
The universe,
what a wonderful idea.

827
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,487
-Take my hat off to you.
-Thank you.

828
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:18,260
Trees, terrific.

829
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,660
-Water, another good one.
-That was a good one.

830
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,987
Yes! Sex— top marks.

831
00:46:23,055 --> 00:46:25,680
Now make it more personal.
A bit more fulsome, please.

832
00:46:25,754 --> 00:46:26,460
Come on.

833
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,084
Immortal, invisible.

834
00:46:28,155 --> 00:46:31,860
You're handsome,
you're glorious.

835
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:32,860
Thank you. More!

836
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,200
You're the most beautiful
person in the world.

837
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,019
Here, I'm getting a bit bored with this.
Can't we change places?

838
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:41,213
That's exactly how I felt.

839
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,100
I only wanted to be like him
and have a few angels adoring me.

840
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:50,153
He didn't see it like that.
Pride, he called it. Sin of pride.

841
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:55,812
Flew into a monumental rage, chucked me
out of heaven, gave me this miserable job.

842
00:46:55,888 --> 00:46:57,820
Just 'cause I wanted
to be loved.

843
00:46:57,888 --> 00:47:00,860
I had no idea.
It's a very sad story.

844
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:02,600
I suppose he had his reasons.

845
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,753
Oh, can't you stop?

846
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:06,753
It's a compulsion!

847
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,560
I'm compelled to. His orders.

848
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,600
Pathetic.

849
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,318
He moves in a very mysterious way,
you know.

850
00:47:16,721 --> 00:47:19,313
Here, that's terrible!

851
00:47:19,388 --> 00:47:23,060
But apart from the way he moves,
what's God really like?

852
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,987
I mean, what colour is he?

853
00:47:25,055 --> 00:47:26,987
He's all colours of the rainbow—
many-hued.

854
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:29,816
-But he is English, isn't he?
-Oh, yes. Very upper-class.

855
00:47:32,821 --> 00:47:36,083
Of course his son had a lot of problems,
having such a famous father.

856
00:47:36,155 --> 00:47:39,587
I always felt sorry for Jesus
having his birthday on Christmas Day.

857
00:47:39,654 --> 00:47:41,643
Just one lot of presents.

858
00:47:49,821 --> 00:47:52,253
That's a bad day's work.

859
00:47:52,322 --> 00:47:54,254
Oh, no. He's in here again.

860
00:47:54,322 --> 00:47:57,254
Come on, Vanity,
you worthless old sin!

861
00:47:57,322 --> 00:48:00,913
Stop preening!
Get back and tidy up your men's room!

862
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,346
How could he see where he's going?

863
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,800
He can't.

864
00:48:14,721 --> 00:48:18,653
What rotten sins I've got working for me.
I suppose it's the wages.

865
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:20,653
Anyway, enough of my problems.

866
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:22,653
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

867
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:25,653
You must be exhausted
after all that business with Margaret.

868
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:28,187
Jealousy really takes it out of you,
doesn't it?

869
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:31,460
Think things over before
you decide on your next wish.

870
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,187
Don't rush into it.
Have a bit of kip.

871
00:48:34,255 --> 00:48:36,686
Things'll seem clearer
in the morning.

872
00:48:36,754 --> 00:48:39,777
You can use my bed
if you like.

873
00:48:39,854 --> 00:48:41,786
Slip into this.

874
00:48:41,854 --> 00:48:43,979
Oh. Where will you sleep then?

875
00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:46,646
Oh, don't worry about me.
I never do.

876
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:49,860
I had a fitful doze in the Middle Ages.
Since then, nothing.

877
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,710
-Go on. You can change through there.
-Thank you.

878
00:48:54,721 --> 00:48:59,484
It's very kind of you to lend me
your room and your bed like this.

879
00:48:59,554 --> 00:49:02,487
You are the first person who's ever
shown any concern for me

880
00:49:02,554 --> 00:49:04,487
and you're the devil.

881
00:49:04,554 --> 00:49:07,660
I mean, God's never taken any interest
in me, as far as I can see.

882
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:12,160
Of course not. He never pushes himself
forward. Prefers to work subliminally.

883
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,360
It's the oldest trick in the game,
your soft-sell technique.

884
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,860
Well, I wish he would push himself
forward and help people a bit

885
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,087
and prove he was there.

886
00:49:19,155 --> 00:49:21,087
Well, in God's view,
for what it's worth,

887
00:49:21,155 --> 00:49:23,100
this would interfere
with your freedom of choice.

888
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,087
Freedom of choice?

889
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:28,660
What sort of freedom of choice
did I have about where I was born

890
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,586
and what size I was

891
00:49:30,654 --> 00:49:33,586
and what a bloody awful job
I landed myself in?

892
00:49:33,654 --> 00:49:36,460
If we really had
freedom of choice

893
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,060
we should be able to decide
who our parents are

894
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,060
and what we look like and everything.

895
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,300
I couldn't agree more.

896
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,300
Then why the hell
doesn't he do something about it?

897
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:46,600
God knows.

898
00:49:47,322 --> 00:49:49,844
Well, that's very handsome,
I must say.

899
00:49:49,921 --> 00:49:52,080
-It's a bit long.
-Suits you down to the ground.

900
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,144
Looks very good on you.

901
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:57,153
Actually, red is not
really my colour.

902
00:49:57,221 --> 00:49:59,414
I'm normally
a bit more conservative.

903
00:49:59,488 --> 00:50:01,420
But it's very nice though.

904
00:50:01,488 --> 00:50:03,477
In you get.

905
00:50:07,654 --> 00:50:09,847
You know, Mr. Spiggott,

906
00:50:09,921 --> 00:50:13,580
you are really the first person who's ever
taken the trouble to talk to me.

907
00:50:13,654 --> 00:50:15,586
I like you.

908
00:50:15,654 --> 00:50:18,586
But you keep on doing
these terrible things.

909
00:50:18,654 --> 00:50:20,643
It's nothing personal.

910
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,400
Well, if you say so.

911
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,516
Good night, Stanley.

912
00:50:25,587 --> 00:50:28,349
-Good night, Mr. Spiggott.
-Call me George.

913
00:50:30,255 --> 00:50:32,244
Oh. Good night, George.

914
00:50:46,854 --> 00:50:48,820
Good...

915
00:50:50,488 --> 00:50:53,352
morning, Mr. Moon.

916
00:50:53,422 --> 00:50:57,513
-Morning?
-I've brought y'all somethin'.

917
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:04,115
-To eat.
-Thank you.

918
00:51:10,055 --> 00:51:11,987
It's so hot in here.

919
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:20,354
Would you help me
with my buttons?

920
00:51:20,422 --> 00:51:23,411
I seem to be
all thumbs this morning.

921
00:51:32,021 --> 00:51:35,748
I find clothes so constricting.

922
00:51:35,821 --> 00:51:39,254
We must allow our pores to breathe.

923
00:51:40,721 --> 00:51:43,585
That's better!

924
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:47,349
Can you hear my pores breathe?

925
00:51:48,854 --> 00:51:50,823
Listen.

926
00:51:50,956 --> 00:51:53,820
Would you like a nibble?

927
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:56,549
Why, you must be ravenous.

928
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,354
Would you like orange juice?

929
00:52:02,323 --> 00:52:04,255
Or...

930
00:52:04,323 --> 00:52:07,811
a succulent, sun-ripe, whole

931
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:10,460
pineapple?

932
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,160
But you have to be careful
of the prickles.

933
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,600
Oh, I will.

934
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,300
Do you like it in bed?

935
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,600
Yes.

936
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,781
Good. So do I!

937
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,879
Look up there.

938
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:33,978
-Don't we make a pretty pair?
-Yes.

939
00:52:34,056 --> 00:52:37,216
-Coffee?
-Yes.

940
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:41,847
Strong, black and sweet.

941
00:52:41,923 --> 00:52:45,083
Two mountainous spoons full.

942
00:52:48,656 --> 00:52:51,418
Hot toast or buttered buns?

943
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,100
Either.

944
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,888
Oh, I love a man
who knows what he wants.

945
00:52:57,956 --> 00:53:01,500
Do you crave marmalade
or honey?

946
00:53:03,056 --> 00:53:05,045
Honey.

947
00:53:10,956 --> 00:53:16,048
I do so love the smell of honey
on a man's lips.

948
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:21,248
Come on now, Lily.
Up you get.

949
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:24,811
Pick your clothes up.
You're due down at the Foreign Office.

950
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:33,717
Good-bye, Mr. Moon.

951
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:36,779
Let's get together soon.

952
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:40,322
Who was that?

953
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:43,981
Didn't she introduce herself?
That's Lilian Lust, the babe with the bust.

954
00:53:44,056 --> 00:53:47,181
Oh. She's quite nice, really.

955
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:50,700
She's a very sweet, warm, wonderful
human being. I'll say that for her.

956
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,783
You know, I—

957
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:56,822
You're quite right. I do see things
much more clearly this morning.

958
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:58,651
I thought you would.

959
00:53:58,723 --> 00:54:02,587
I was thinking about that girl, Lilian.
You know, she's—

960
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,986
Shh! Stanley.

961
00:54:05,056 --> 00:54:07,700
I wouldn't mess around with
married women if I were you.

962
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,260
-Oh. Is she married?
-Yes. Tragic business.

963
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,247
Completely incompatible.
You met the husband, Sloth.

964
00:54:13,323 --> 00:54:15,700
-That's it then. She's out.
-Afraid so.

965
00:54:17,023 --> 00:54:20,750
But can I be someone
who women

966
00:54:20,823 --> 00:54:23,860
yearn after and crave for
and lust after?

967
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,160
You'd like to be young
and sexy and dynamic

968
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,555
and have beautiful women
hurl themselves at your feet.

969
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:31,660
Yeah, that's it. But most of all,
it's gotta be Margaret.

970
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:33,814
I want Margaret
lusting after me.

971
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:37,050
I'll tell you what people go mad for
these days. That's your pop stars.

972
00:54:37,123 --> 00:54:41,351
I can just see you, Stanley,
standing there in your skintight pants,

973
00:54:41,424 --> 00:54:45,719
the music pounding,
the women screaming, Margaret laughing,

974
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:49,586
the drums throbbing out
with their incessant animal beat!

975
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:51,983
Let me have it!

976
00:54:52,023 --> 00:54:54,260
Julie Andrews!

977
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:13,578
Oh, Stanley!

978
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:20,700
Stanley!

979
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,800
§ Tell me you're fool
of yearning for me §

980
00:55:30,323 --> 00:55:33,050
I love you, Stanley!

981
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:32,000
§ Touch me and say that
you can't live without me §

982
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:39,900
§ Tell me you need me,
touch me and say §

983
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,200
§ Oh, love me! §

984
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:23,900
§ I've got to have you
oh, don't run away §

985
00:56:21,956 --> 00:56:23,888
Oh, Stanley!

986
00:56:43,457 --> 00:56:48,116
And now, this year's
most exciting discovery,

987
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:51,088
Drimble Wedge and the Vegetation!

988
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,460
§ I'm bedazzled §

989
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,100
§ I don't care §

990
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,300
§ I'm bedazzled §

991
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,000
§ So you said §

992
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:18,900
§ You knock me out §

993
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:19,900
§ I don't want you §

994
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,000
§ I don't need you §

995
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,900
§ You burn me out §

996
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,600
§ I don't love you §

997
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,100
§ Leave me alone §

998
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,000
§ You switch me out §

999
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,000
§ I'm self contained §

1000
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:42,000
§ Just go away §

1001
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:49,500
§ I'm bedazzled §

1002
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,100
§ I'm cold §

1003
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,700
§ I'm shallow §

1004
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,200
§ You drive me wild §

00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,500
§ You fill me with __  §

1006
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,800
§ Don't get excited §

1007
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:22,100
§ Save your prayers §

1008
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:30,800
§ I'm not interested §

1009
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,700
§ It's too much effort §

1010
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,100
§ Don't you ever leave off? §

1011
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:48,000
§ I'm bedazzled §

1012
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,700
§ I'm not available §

1013
00:59:00,823 --> 00:59:03,289
Oh, hello, Stanley.

1014
00:59:03,357 --> 00:59:07,016
Nice to have you back so soon.
I won't be a moment.

1015
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,920
Hello. You've just cut me off.
I was talking to Tokyo.

1016
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:16,019
-Do you really love me?
-Of course I do, you jerk!
-Get off my line!

1017
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:19,079
I thought you were supposed
to be my friend.

1018
00:59:19,157 --> 00:59:21,089
All that talk.

1019
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,487
Your bed and that girl
this morning.

1020
00:59:23,556 --> 00:59:27,500
You just put her there to get me all excited
and confused so I'd make the wrong decision.

1021
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:29,584
-What happened?
-"What happened".

1022
00:59:29,656 --> 00:59:32,145
It finished before it started.
That's what happened.

1023
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:36,882
They're like that these days, your pop fans,
aren't they? Very fickle.

1024
00:59:36,956 --> 00:59:39,218
-Mrs. Fitch?
-Speaking.

1025
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:42,450
-Abercrombie here. I work with your husband.
-Oh, yes?

1026
00:59:42,523 --> 00:59:46,700
I thought you'd like to know he's just checked
in to the Cheeseborough Hotel, Brighton

1027
00:59:46,756 --> 00:59:50,100
with his secretary, Fiona.
Good-bye.

1028
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,586
What a putrid thing to do.

1029
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:56,316
Why did I get myself
into such a mess?

1030
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:59,447
Let me answer that
by asking you a question.

1031
00:59:59,523 --> 01:00:03,422
In the words of the great
Zen master, Li Kwi Kwat,

1032
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:06,320
"If you were hanging
from a cliff by your fingernails

1033
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:10,447
and above you was a raging tiger
baring his fangs

1034
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:14,060
and below you was the tiger's mate,
baring her fangs

1035
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,521
what would you do?"

1036
01:00:15,589 --> 01:00:17,919
What a stupid question!

1037
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:22,013
Cliffs and tigers. I wouldn't get myself
into such a ridiculous situation.

1038
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:25,250
Of course not.
You've got the secret.

1039
01:00:25,323 --> 01:00:27,312
You're far better off.

1040
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:30,015
Here you are,
halfway up a pole in Berkshire,

1041
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:33,783
damned in the hereafter for eternity,
half your wishes gone.

1042
01:00:33,856 --> 01:00:37,515
You've nothing to learn from Li Kwi Kwat
and his tigers, have you?

1043
01:00:39,257 --> 01:00:41,814
-Hello. Mrs. Phelps?
-Hello. Yes?

1044
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:43,947
-Mrs. Jonathan Phelps?
-Yes.

1045
01:00:44,023 --> 01:00:47,614
Mrs. Jonathan Phelps
of 8 Puseley Rise, Hounslow, Middlesex?

1046
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:52,060
-Did I get you out of the bath
to answer the phone?  -Yes, you did.

1047
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:53,900
Sorry. Wrong number.

1048
01:00:55,424 --> 01:00:58,651
Your tricks are so bloomin' dismal.

1049
01:00:58,723 --> 01:01:01,518
I know, Stanley.
Don't rub it in.

1050
01:01:01,589 --> 01:01:03,612
I've lost my spark.

1051
01:01:03,689 --> 01:01:06,178
There was a time
when I used to get lots of ideas.

1052
01:01:06,257 --> 01:01:08,984
I was creative, original.

1053
01:01:09,056 --> 01:01:11,749
I thought up the seven deadly sins
in one afternoon.

1054
01:01:11,823 --> 01:01:15,381
The only thing I've come up
with recently is advertising.

1055
01:01:15,457 --> 01:01:18,786
Blimey! We're due at Mrs. Wisby's.
Hurry up. Let's get changed.

1056
01:01:18,856 --> 01:01:22,345
You're so dull,
the way you go about things.

1057
01:01:22,424 --> 01:01:24,912
Everything you do
is third-rate.

1058
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:27,460
Pass me over me britches.
There's a good chap.

1059
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,860
"Pass me my britches".

1060
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,319
The Prince of Darkness
changing his britches in a GPO van.

1061
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:35,844
What's the matter with you?
Where's your style? Use your magic powers.

1062
01:01:35,923 --> 01:01:40,219
I daren't waste those. I've got to save
all that up for my struggle with him.

1063
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:42,313
I thought you were supposed
to be his equal.

1064
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:44,548
Huh! That'll be the day.

1065
01:01:44,623 --> 01:01:47,181
-For a start, he's omnipresent.
-What do you mean?

1066
01:01:47,257 --> 01:01:50,916
I only mean he's everywhere,
all over the world, at the same time.

1067
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,922
That's all I mean.
I'm just highly manoeuvrable.

1068
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:56,785
-So he's in here right now.
-Of course he is.

1069
01:01:56,856 --> 01:01:59,118
He's in the van.
He's in the can.

1070
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:01,452
He's up the trees.
He's in the breeze.

1071
01:02:01,523 --> 01:02:03,648
He's in your hair.
He's everywhere.

1072
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:06,985
Spying on you, peering at you,
listening to everything you say.

1073
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:11,148
There's no privacy for anyone.
Get out of here while I'm changing, can't you?

1074
01:02:11,223 --> 01:02:13,654
You won't get anywhere
by shouting at him, you know.

1075
01:02:13,723 --> 01:02:18,156
You're quite right, of course.
I'll try the humble approach.

1076
01:02:18,223 --> 01:02:20,814
Excuse me,
Your Ineffable Hugeness.

1077
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:23,960
I wonder if you'd be gracious enough
to step outside for a moment

1078
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,513
while we miserable worms
get our drawers on.

1079
01:02:26,589 --> 01:02:29,521
I can't say you sounded
very sincere, mate.

1080
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:33,719
Here! What's your game?

1081
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:37,900
I wanted to give him a bit of a turn.
I saw him nestling in your trousers.

1082
01:02:43,696 --> 01:02:47,685
Good afternoon, madam.
We are the Froony Green Eyewash men.

1083
01:02:47,763 --> 01:02:51,360
Have you, by any chance, got 10 bottles
of Froony Green Eyewash in your house?

1084
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,193
Oh, no. I'm afraid I haven't.

1085
01:02:54,263 --> 01:02:57,560
Oh, what a pity, 'cause if you had
and could answer a simple question

1086
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,060
you'd have won a beautiful
silver tea service

1087
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:02,618
and a night on the town
with Alfred Hitchcock.

1088
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:04,594
Oh, what a shame.

1089
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,151
Never mind. Look,
I'll tell you what.

1090
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:10,219
Nobody will ever know
the difference.

1091
01:03:10,296 --> 01:03:15,092
Why don't you nip down to the shops,
buy 10 bottles of Froony Green Eyewash

1092
01:03:15,163 --> 01:03:17,493
come back here
as quickly as you can

1093
01:03:17,562 --> 01:03:19,926
and I'll pretend you had them
all the time.

1094
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,400
You are very kind.

1095
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:23,200
Hurry back now.

1096
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,500
Let's get something to eat.

1097
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,360
Let's see what we've got. Very nice.

1098
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:33,955
Raspberries, cream, sugar...

1099
01:03:34,030 --> 01:03:38,400
Ideal combination
for a lovely summer afternoon.

1100
01:03:40,996 --> 01:03:42,985
Oh, leave her a few.

1101
01:03:43,063 --> 01:03:45,052
I need them more than she does.

1102
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:47,062
I'm so depressed.

1103
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:50,290
This job,
it's really getting me down.

1104
01:03:50,363 --> 01:03:54,022
What have you got
to be depressed about?

1105
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:56,085
I mean, look on the bright side.

1106
01:03:56,163 --> 01:03:59,788
Think of all your successes.
Sodom and Gomorrah.

1107
01:03:59,863 --> 01:04:02,556
Short-lived, Stanley.
Short-lived.

1108
01:04:02,629 --> 01:04:05,323
Besides, as soon as I get
a really swinging scene going

1109
01:04:05,397 --> 01:04:08,794
he butts in
with his fire and brimstone.

1110
01:04:08,863 --> 01:04:11,920
He's a very destructive,
unpredictable person.

1111
01:04:11,996 --> 01:04:14,723
Is that why you can't insure
against acts of God?

1112
01:04:14,796 --> 01:04:19,200
Exactly. As if that isn't enough, I've got
last-minute repentance to contend with.

1113
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,592
-That doesn't sound too much of a threat.
-Not much of a threat?

1114
01:04:22,662 --> 01:04:25,992
Do you realise I can spend 50
or 60 years working on a client,

1115
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:29,551
making him vain, greedy,
lustful, slothful, the lot...

1116
01:04:29,629 --> 01:04:33,060
and then just when he's breathing his last,
he goes and bloody repents?

1117
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:35,292
-I lost Mussolini that way.
-Really?

1118
01:04:35,363 --> 01:04:38,360
At the very moment they're putting
the noose around his neck, he says,

1119
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,528
"Scusi. Mille regrette."
Up he goes. Psst!

1120
01:04:45,363 --> 01:04:49,060
Here they are.
Ten bottles of Froony's Green Eyewash.

1121
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,518
I just got in
before they closed.

1122
01:04:50,596 --> 01:04:52,687
Well done,
Mrs. Wisby.

1123
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:57,800
Now all you have to do is answer
one very simple question. Are you ready?

1124
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,386
How tall is the Duke of Edinburgh?

1125
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:02,928
Oh, dear.

1126
01:05:02,996 --> 01:05:07,300
Let me see. I saw it somewhere.
Six foot one, is it?

1127
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,760
Alas, no.

1128
01:05:09,829 --> 01:05:12,318
The correct answer is six foot two.

1129
01:05:12,397 --> 01:05:15,090
And this means you've lost £10.

1130
01:05:15,163 --> 01:05:17,856
Terribly sorry, Mrs. Wisby.
Better luck next time.

1131
01:05:17,929 --> 01:05:20,588
Come on, Stanley. Off we go.

1132
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,700
Good-bye!

1133
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:26,491
That poor old lady.
How can you be so mean?

1134
01:05:26,562 --> 01:05:28,892
That grasping, greedy old bag?

1135
01:05:28,963 --> 01:05:31,361
She didn't mind the idea
of cheating Froony's.

1136
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:34,419
Ooh, by the way, I forgot to tell you
something about Margaret Spencer.

1137
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,860
-What's that?
-She's dead.

1138
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:39,400
-No, she's not.
-No, she's not.

1139
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,800
-She's not?
-No, she's alive.

1140
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,795
Then why did you say that?

1141
01:05:43,863 --> 01:05:47,057
Malice. I'm a liar.
I do it the whole time. I can't help it.

1142
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:49,925
Are you telling me that
everything you've ever said is a lie?

1143
01:05:49,996 --> 01:05:52,791
Everything I've ever told you
has been a lie, including that.

1144
01:05:52,863 --> 01:05:54,275
Including what?

1145
01:05:54,315 --> 01:05:55,860
That everything I've ever told you
has been a lie.

1146
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:57,600
That's not true.

1147
01:05:57,800 --> 01:05:59,304
I don't know what to believe.

1148
01:05:59,344 --> 01:06:00,853
Not me, Stanley. Believe me.

1149
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:07,060
Listen, you tell me one thing,
and it better be true.

1150
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:09,857
What is Margaret Spencer
doing right now?

1151
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,860
Scout's honour, Stanley.

1152
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,225
She's with that powerfully built
Inspector Clark.

1153
01:06:15,296 --> 01:06:18,500
She's very concerned about you.

1154
01:06:18,863 --> 01:06:22,625
Oh, I'd like to be in the room with them.
Wish I was a fly on the wall.

1155
01:06:22,696 --> 01:06:24,594
-Julie Andrews!
-You rotten bas—!

1156
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,594
You've tricked me again!

1157
01:06:26,662 --> 01:06:28,594
That wasn't meant to be a wish!

1158
01:06:28,662 --> 01:06:31,628
I only did what you said.
Blow a raspberry.

1159
01:06:31,696 --> 01:06:33,628
Not yet.
I want to see what's going on.

1160
01:06:33,696 --> 01:06:35,685
And why are you here with me?

1161
01:06:35,763 --> 01:06:38,252
I want to protect you, Stanley.
I like you.

1162
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:40,026
I'd hate to see you swatted.

1163
01:06:40,066 --> 01:06:41,762
Shut up. Here she comes.

1164
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:43,053
Lovely weather we've been having.

1165
01:06:43,093 --> 01:06:44,318
Lovely.

1166
01:06:44,397 --> 01:06:46,386
Of course,
we've been kept pretty busy.

1167
01:06:46,463 --> 01:06:50,452
It's the summer frocks.
I've had three rapes
on my hands this morning.

1168
01:06:50,529 --> 01:06:53,518
-Is that a lot?
-Oh, round about the seasonal average.

1169
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,789
That's a nice dress you're wearing.

1170
01:06:55,863 --> 01:06:57,726
I don't like his attitude.

1171
01:06:57,796 --> 01:07:01,000
I've always had mixed feelings
about rape.

1172
01:07:07,096 --> 01:07:09,360
I mean, half the time,

1173
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,157
it's the girls
that have led things on.

1174
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:14,219
I agree with you.

1175
01:07:18,296 --> 01:07:21,700
They bring it on themselves, you know.
They really do.

1176
01:07:23,763 --> 01:07:26,593
I'm so happy he's not here.

1177
01:07:26,662 --> 01:07:30,685
But we must find him
before he kills himself.

1178
01:07:30,763 --> 01:07:32,592
She noticed me!
She noticed me!

1179
01:07:32,662 --> 01:07:34,594
Well.

1180
01:07:35,596 --> 01:07:37,585
Thank you, lads.

1181
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:41,152
Not him?

1182
01:07:42,296 --> 01:07:45,285
Oh, it's cold in here.

1183
01:07:45,363 --> 01:07:48,022
He seemed a cut above the others.

1184
01:07:48,096 --> 01:07:50,255
There was something different
about him.

1185
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:52,522
A special quality.

1186
01:07:52,596 --> 01:07:55,585
He put so much
into those cheeseburgers.

1187
01:07:55,662 --> 01:07:57,525
He was a real artist.

1188
01:07:57,596 --> 01:08:00,360
Yes, but like so many
of your artistic types,

1189
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,128
unable to cope with life,
he took the coward's way out.

1190
01:08:03,196 --> 01:08:04,855
He called me a coward!

1191
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:08,225
The vice squad is having
a bit of a do tonight.

1192
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:09,725
Would you like to come along?

1193
01:08:09,765 --> 01:08:13,854
-Will I be allowed? An outsider?
-Of course!

1194
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:16,554
They asked us
to bring along a girlfriend.

1195
01:08:16,629 --> 01:08:18,561
You'd soon feel at home.

1196
01:08:18,629 --> 01:08:20,353
I'm gonna break this up!

1197
01:08:20,393 --> 01:08:24,100
But you've never flown before.
You can't go up alone.

1198
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:27,300
Oh, yes, I can.
I'll take him first. You follow.

1199
01:08:29,130 --> 01:08:32,160
The Vice Squad is usually having
a first-class get-together.

1200
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,458
Flap them, Stanley!

1201
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:36,900
Not your legs, your wings!

1202
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:41,927
You've got lovely lips.
Very tempting and alluring.

1203
01:08:41,996 --> 01:08:44,224
"Lorelei lips"
is what I call them.

1204
01:08:44,296 --> 01:08:47,353
-Has anyone ever said that before?
-No, never.

1205
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:49,137
Here I come, Stanley!

1206
01:08:49,177 --> 01:08:50,884
I don't want to alarm you

1207
01:08:50,963 --> 01:08:54,293
but I'd say that lips like that
would be a magnet to sex maniacs.

1208
01:08:54,363 --> 01:08:56,100
Really?

1209
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,987
Damn flies!

1210
01:08:59,063 --> 01:09:03,325
-Oh, it's a whopper!
-Oh, let's get out of this fly trap.

1211
01:09:22,196 --> 01:09:25,000
Blow your raspberry.

1212
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:29,025
I can't, with these terrible fly's lips!

1213
01:09:29,096 --> 01:09:33,256
Quick, blow your raspberry!

1214
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:39,727
She noticed me, George.
She noticed me.

1215
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:43,087
I must have her before she goes to
that terrible vice party with the police.

1216
01:09:43,163 --> 01:09:44,921
That's what I'm here for.

1217
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:46,720
I want her to be in love
with everything about me.

1218
01:09:46,796 --> 01:09:48,270
Madly in love with me!

1219
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:49,785
Look, Stanley.

1220
01:09:49,863 --> 01:09:53,795
I feel terribly bad about the way
I've tricked you in the past.

1221
01:09:53,863 --> 01:09:58,000
I want to be nice to you this time.
Really nice to you. I mean it. I'd like to help you.

1222
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,788
I've been thinking
about your problem.

1223
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,886
What I think you need
is the simple life.

1224
01:10:03,963 --> 01:10:06,020
How does this strike you?

1225
01:10:06,096 --> 01:10:11,085
You and Margaret
are both warm, tender, loving people.

1226
01:10:11,163 --> 01:10:14,152
Picture a little cottage
in the country.

1227
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:18,685
Two beautiful children
are playing in the sunlit garden.

1228
01:10:18,763 --> 01:10:21,991
Margaret's in the kitchen,
preparing the anniversary dinner.

1229
01:10:22,063 --> 01:10:24,551
She hears you drive up in the car.

1230
01:10:24,629 --> 01:10:27,118
She's madly in love with you
and you with her.

1231
01:10:27,196 --> 01:10:30,923
She's bursting with the anticipation
of seeing you at the end of the day.

1232
01:10:30,996 --> 01:10:33,985
By George, you've got it.
I think you've got it.

1233
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:38,552
Julie Andrews.

1234
01:10:38,629 --> 01:10:41,289
Darling!

1235
01:10:46,463 --> 01:10:47,840
Hello, darling.

1236
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,258
Hello, darling.

1237
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:50,890
Hope you don't mind me
bringing Stanley along.

1238
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:52,490
Oh, he's always welcome.

1239
01:10:52,562 --> 01:10:54,721
-Would you like a drink, Stanley?
-Please.

1240
01:10:54,796 --> 01:10:57,785
I'll do that. You sit down.
You've been coping with the kids all day.

1241
01:10:57,863 --> 01:11:00,886
Go on. Have a good sit-down. Relax.
What are you going to have? Your usual?

1242
01:11:00,963 --> 01:11:01,937
Yes, dear.

1243
01:11:01,977 --> 01:11:02,952
Right.

1244
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:05,360
You know that book
I was reading?

1245
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:08,419
-The Spinoza Reassessment?
-Yes.

1246
01:11:08,497 --> 01:11:11,258
I was thinking Stanley should have
a look at that. Fascinating.

1247
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:13,795
Absolutely fascinating.

1248
01:11:13,863 --> 01:11:17,590
Here we are. Old Mr. Wine
will soon set you on your feet again.

1249
01:11:17,662 --> 01:11:21,220
-What for you, Stanley?
-Oh, I'll have the same as Margaret.

1250
01:11:21,296 --> 01:11:23,523
Same as Margaret. Wine.

1251
01:11:23,596 --> 01:11:27,256
I bet you thought I'd forgotten
what day it was.

1252
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:31,500
How awful of me.
I forgot!

1253
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,892
Don't be silly.
You've got so much on your mind.

1254
01:11:34,963 --> 01:11:37,452
Who cares about
a silly old anniversary?

1255
01:11:37,529 --> 01:11:39,500
What matters is
we love each other.

1256
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,553
Do you know, Stanley, we've been married
seven years? It's our wooden wedding.

1257
01:11:43,629 --> 01:11:46,391
Incredible.
I got a little something for you.

1258
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,826
From my heart.

1259
01:11:48,896 --> 01:11:51,124
Darling. Oh.

1260
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:55,423
Here's to our marriage.

1261
01:11:55,497 --> 01:11:57,724
Here's to all of us.

1262
01:11:57,796 --> 01:11:58,742
Cheers.

1263
01:11:58,782 --> 01:11:59,728
Cheers.

1264
01:11:59,796 --> 01:12:01,785
Cheers.

1265
01:12:01,863 --> 01:12:04,886
I'll go and get that book.

1266
01:12:06,996 --> 01:12:10,485
-I forgot our wedding anniversary.
-Don't be upset.

1267
01:12:10,562 --> 01:12:13,960
-I feel so dreadful!
-Oh, darling—

1268
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:15,504
Here we are.

1269
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:17,019
See what you make of it.

1270
01:12:17,096 --> 01:12:19,584
We can discuss it at next week's tutorial.
Fine.

1271
01:12:19,662 --> 01:12:22,151
-I must get on with the cooking.
-Don't you do a thing.

1272
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:26,356
You sit down, relax and enjoy your drink.
I'll do the supper tonight.

1273
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:29,419
I feel a bit of an intruder,
your anniversary and everything.

1274
01:12:29,497 --> 01:12:32,519
You're not an intruder.
You're very welcome. Isn't he, Margaret?

1275
01:12:32,596 --> 01:12:34,687
Well, I ought to be off anyway.

1276
01:12:34,763 --> 01:12:38,196
I want to catch the Giotto exhibition.
What time's the next bus to Oxford?

1277
01:12:38,263 --> 01:12:41,058
Are you going to that?
I've got a great idea.

1278
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:44,260
Margaret, why don't you drive Stanley?
You can see it together.

1279
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,860
You've been longing to see that.
It's the last day.

1280
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,960
I can't. There's the supper,
the kids to put to bed.

1281
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,324
I'll do all that.

1282
01:12:50,397 --> 01:12:53,386
It'll be your present to me. Really.

1283
01:12:53,463 --> 01:12:55,395
You are sweet, darling.

1284
01:12:55,463 --> 01:12:57,022
Go on. Enjoy yourself
and come back for supper.

1285
01:12:57,062 --> 01:13:01,860
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely positive.

1286
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,185
Hello, darlings!
Up into Daddy's arms.

1287
01:13:04,263 --> 01:13:05,288
Bye-bye.

1288
01:13:05,328 --> 01:13:06,354
Say bye-bye to Mommy. Bye-bye.

1289
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:07,904
Look after Daddy, darlings.

1290
01:13:07,944 --> 01:13:09,419
Look after Margaret, Stanley.

1291
01:13:09,497 --> 01:13:11,539
I will.

1292
01:13:11,579 --> 01:13:13,060
Have a good time.

1293
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:16,219
Blow a kiss to Mommy.
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

1294
01:13:24,763 --> 01:13:26,487
Do you think he knows?

1295
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,252
It would never occur to him.

1296
01:13:31,330 --> 01:13:33,262
Oh.

1297
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:38,895
He's such a marvellous man.

1298
01:13:38,963 --> 01:13:43,123
The way he brings philosophy to life.

1299
01:13:43,196 --> 01:13:46,958
Oh, he couldn't be
a better husband or father.

1300
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:50,621
Or teacher.
He's a saint.

1301
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:55,191
He's the only man I know

1302
01:13:55,263 --> 01:13:58,058
who actually lives up to his ideals.

1303
01:13:58,130 --> 01:14:00,721
He's such an example to us all.

1304
01:14:04,696 --> 01:14:07,288
The children worship him.

1305
01:14:07,363 --> 01:14:10,386
He's more of a god
than a human being.

1306
01:14:10,463 --> 01:14:13,054
If only he weren't so good.

1307
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:15,527
If only he had one tiny flaw.

1308
01:14:15,596 --> 01:14:21,224
We must stop thinking about him
and think more of ourselves!

1309
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:29,900
But it would kill him if he knew.
I feel as if I'm being torn apart.

1310
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:37,092
My darling.
My precious darling.

1311
01:14:38,996 --> 01:14:41,621
We can't—

1312
01:14:41,696 --> 01:14:43,855
We can't keep on denying ourselves.

1313
01:14:43,929 --> 01:14:48,755
All these years we've been married
he's never said a cross word.

1314
01:14:48,829 --> 01:14:54,828
When I was ill
he came to my room

1315
01:14:54,896 --> 01:14:59,561
and he gave me
some soup he had made.

1316
01:14:59,629 --> 01:15:04,324
Oh, Stanley!
How can we do this to him?

1317
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:07,554
I love you.

1318
01:15:07,629 --> 01:15:10,095
And I love you.

1319
01:15:10,163 --> 01:15:15,152
It can't hurt him
if he doesn't know.

1320
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:18,128
I want—

1321
01:15:18,196 --> 01:15:20,559
I want to give you my love

1322
01:15:20,629 --> 01:15:25,289
in the best,
most beautiful way.

1323
01:15:37,763 --> 01:15:41,423
What? What is it?

1324
01:15:41,497 --> 01:15:44,985
It's his pipe.
His favourite pipe.

1325
01:15:45,063 --> 01:15:47,620
But, Margaret,
don't be upset, please.

1326
01:15:47,696 --> 01:15:49,889
And we were going to—

1327
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:52,122
On his favourite pipe!

1328
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:55,962
The whole thing's impossible!

1329
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:57,893
-No, Margaret!
-Go. Just go!

1330
01:15:57,963 --> 01:16:00,452
We must never see each other again,
for his sake.

1331
01:16:00,529 --> 01:16:03,825
Margaret, please.
Please, Margaret!

1332
01:16:03,896 --> 01:16:08,794
Margaret, please!
Margaret, I beg of you!

1333
01:16:21,662 --> 01:16:24,026
Hello, Stanley.

1334
01:16:24,096 --> 01:16:26,028
Hold this.

1335
01:16:26,096 --> 01:16:28,028
Whatever you say, George.

1336
01:16:28,096 --> 01:16:30,028
You sound down in the dumps.

1337
01:16:30,096 --> 01:16:31,660
Why not?

1338
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:35,426
You painted a beautiful dream
and shoved me into a nightmare.

1339
01:16:35,497 --> 01:16:38,724
You should never believe the ads.
Shine the light up a bit.

1340
01:16:38,796 --> 01:16:40,955
What are you doing now?

1341
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:45,053
Just putting a tiny little
ventilation hole in this oil tanker.

1342
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:48,894
Up we go.

1343
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:56,957
That Nicholas was so sickening
with all his blasted sweetness and— ugh!

1344
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:59,019
I know what you mean, Stanley.

1345
01:16:59,096 --> 01:17:01,926
Most of the saints throughout history
have been a pain in the neck.

1346
01:17:01,996 --> 01:17:05,224
Give me a hand with these bottles, would you?
I'm due down in Fleet Street.

1347
01:17:05,296 --> 01:17:07,285
You can't stop, can you, eh?

1348
01:17:07,363 --> 01:17:10,056
As a matter of fact, I will very soon.
My job's almost done.

1349
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,062
What do you mean?

1350
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:15,687
I was up in heaven a few thousand years ago,
having a summit conference with God.

1351
01:17:15,763 --> 01:17:18,093
I was putting forward
a few new proposals.

1352
01:17:18,163 --> 01:17:20,594
-You go up there every now and again?
-Yes.

1353
01:17:20,662 --> 01:17:22,924
We were having a giggle
about Job actually.

1354
01:17:22,996 --> 01:17:27,395
That poor bloke you gave all the boils to
and burnt his home and destroyed his family?

1355
01:17:27,463 --> 01:17:30,560
That's right. God thought
it would be a good idea

1356
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:33,624
if I tested Job's faith
with a few diseases and disasters.

1357
01:17:33,696 --> 01:17:35,685
You didn't win though, did you?

1358
01:17:35,763 --> 01:17:39,160
In spite of all you did to him,
he still believed that God was good.

1359
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,091
Well, Job was what you'd
technically describe as a loony.

1360
01:17:42,163 --> 01:17:44,958
But as I pointed out
to God at the time

1361
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:48,757
for every Job or soul
that he lands, I get two.

1362
01:17:48,829 --> 01:17:51,193
I was two billion ahead already.

1363
01:17:51,263 --> 01:17:53,592
You make it sound
like a blooming game.

1364
01:17:53,662 --> 01:17:55,594
That's precisely what it is.

1365
01:17:55,662 --> 01:17:58,992
And the first one to reach
a hundred billion souls is the winner.

1366
01:17:59,063 --> 01:18:03,120
He doesn't stand a chance actually.
I've only got six to go.

1367
01:18:03,196 --> 01:18:05,355
What happens
when you get them?

1368
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:07,360
Oh, when I've won...

1369
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,660
When I've won the world will be
in such a rotten, stinking mess

1370
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:12,752
that it can get on
without me.

1371
01:18:12,829 --> 01:18:17,228
I'll go back to heaven, sit on God's
right hand and be his favourite angel again.

1372
01:18:17,296 --> 01:18:22,285
It must be very nice for you to go back
to heaven, but what will happen to me?

1373
01:18:22,363 --> 01:18:25,295
Don't worry, Stanley.
Your future's assured.

1374
01:18:25,363 --> 01:18:27,295
George...

1375
01:18:29,363 --> 01:18:32,090
I don't want to go on
with the rest of my wishes.

1376
01:18:32,163 --> 01:18:35,890
I can't find happiness like this.
You're always too clever for me.

1377
01:18:35,963 --> 01:18:41,457
So I'll be running along
and I'll see you sometime, huh?

1378
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,757
Stanley,
I can't let you go in this mood.

1379
01:18:50,829 --> 01:18:53,886
Let's cancel my appointment.
I'm ahead of schedule, in any case.

1380
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:57,054
-No, I can't interrupt your work.
-What are friends for?

1381
01:18:57,130 --> 01:19:00,896
I'll round up Avarice and Gluttony,
two lovely girls. The afternoon's on me.

1382
01:19:04,497 --> 01:19:06,985
Oh, eat up, Stanley!

1383
01:19:07,063 --> 01:19:11,000
-Come on, Stanley. Stick one
in Jane Russell and win a goldfish.  -No.

1384
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,958
You have a go, Gluttony.
Chuck 'em. Don't eat 'em.

1385
01:19:16,029 --> 01:19:19,120
This is how Garibaldi lost his life.

1386
01:19:19,196 --> 01:19:23,594
-Enjoying yourself, Stanley?
-You know I can't stand heights, George.

1387
01:19:24,762 --> 01:19:28,354
Up, up, up, up!
Having fun, Stanley?

1388
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:33,419
Bang!

1389
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:38,960
-Another 10 shillings gone.
-Don't worry about that, Avarice.

1390
01:19:45,196 --> 01:19:47,424
Enjoying yourself, Stanley?

1391
01:19:48,029 --> 01:19:51,654
That's three pounds-seven and nine pence
without Gluttony's sweets.

1392
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,991
George,
take me out of here, will you?

1393
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:00,760
Enough, George, is enough.
We didn't need to take a taxi.

1394
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:03,762
Nothing's too much
for my friend Stanley.

1395
01:20:03,829 --> 01:20:06,989
Thank you very much for this afternoon,
George, but

1396
01:20:07,063 --> 01:20:09,551
I don't think it's really helped,
you know.

1397
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,000
I still don't want to go on with it.

1398
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:13,060
But you were so nearly there,
last time.

1399
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:17,052
She loved you, you loved her.
You just left me one little loophole.

1400
01:20:17,129 --> 01:20:20,686
I had to take advantage of it.
Doctor's orders.

1401
01:20:20,762 --> 01:20:25,024
Next time you must specify,
really spell things out in detail.

1402
01:20:25,096 --> 01:20:27,755
I can't think straight anymore.

1403
01:20:27,829 --> 01:20:31,455
Take your time.
Have another lie-down in my room.

1404
01:20:31,529 --> 01:20:35,485
Yeah, and then you put Lust
in the bed just to confuse me.

1405
01:20:35,562 --> 01:20:39,120
I promise you,
Lust won't be there.

1406
01:20:42,762 --> 01:20:44,694
Hello.

1407
01:20:44,762 --> 01:20:47,320
Oh, excuse me. I thought this
was Mr. Spiggott's bedroom.

1408
01:20:47,396 --> 01:20:50,157
How right you were. It is.

1409
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:54,185
Oh. Well, he must have made a mistake.
He said I could use it.

1410
01:20:54,263 --> 01:20:57,161
Oh, you're his new little favourite,
are you?

1411
01:20:57,230 --> 01:20:59,196
I'm Stanley Moon.
Who are you?

1412
01:20:59,263 --> 01:21:02,161
They call me Envy.

1413
01:21:02,230 --> 01:21:05,025
Not a very attractive name, is it?

1414
01:21:05,096 --> 01:21:09,551
I always wanted to be called Vanity.
Never mind. I'm stuck with it.

1415
01:21:09,629 --> 01:21:12,652
How is Mr. Spiggott these days?

1416
01:21:12,729 --> 01:21:15,423
Quite well.
He may be leaving soon.

1417
01:21:15,797 --> 01:21:17,786
Charming.

1418
01:21:17,862 --> 01:21:20,454
I'm always the last to be told.

1419
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:23,325
It's funny how he's always
too busy for me

1420
01:21:23,396 --> 01:21:26,987
but he's never too busy
for Lust, ducky.

1421
01:21:27,062 --> 01:21:29,585
He's at her beck and bloody call.

1422
01:21:29,663 --> 01:21:32,720
Look, what are you doing
in George's bedroom?

1423
01:21:32,797 --> 01:21:35,627
Oh, it's"George," is it?

1424
01:21:35,696 --> 01:21:38,093
Good friends, I suppose.

1425
01:21:38,163 --> 01:21:42,323
If you want to know why I'm in his bedroom,
go and take a look at mine.

1426
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:43,800
What's wrong with it?

1427
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,900
What's right with it?

1428
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:47,600
For a start, it's half the size
of all the others.

1429
01:21:47,429 --> 01:21:50,691
Wallpaper's peeling off, and it's miles
from the nearest convenience.

1430
01:21:50,763 --> 01:21:54,422
Of course, Lust and Gluttony
are right next door to the bathroom.

1431
01:21:54,496 --> 01:21:56,758
Nothing's too good for them.

1432
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:59,318
Well, I suppose Lust and Gluttony

1433
01:21:59,396 --> 01:22:02,419
really have to be
rather near the bathroom.

1434
01:22:02,496 --> 01:22:06,053
You're on the seven-wishes bit,
aren't you, dear?

1435
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:09,789
Yeah, but it doesn't seem
to be doing me much good.

1436
01:22:09,862 --> 01:22:13,625
Although George said if I really specified
the personality, I'd be all right.

1437
01:22:13,696 --> 01:22:16,526
Don't you believe it, cherub.

1438
01:22:16,596 --> 01:22:19,084
He may think he's the cat's whiskers

1439
01:22:19,163 --> 01:22:23,391
but there's one person
who can run rings round him.

1440
01:22:23,463 --> 01:22:25,520
Who do you mean?

1441
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,400
God?

1442
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:34,456
Old creepy drawers
can't hold a candle to him.

1443
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:38,322
I think you've got me this time, Stanley.
Let me get it quite clear.

1444
01:22:38,396 --> 01:22:42,328
I want to be a warm, loving,
tender person

1445
01:22:42,396 --> 01:22:45,021
and Margaret exactly the same.

1446
01:22:45,096 --> 01:22:49,085
I want all the fun of meeting her for
the first time and falling in love with her.

1447
01:22:49,163 --> 01:22:52,993
I love her, and she loves me,
we are in love forever.

1448
01:22:53,063 --> 01:22:55,722
Surroundings?

1449
01:22:55,796 --> 01:23:01,660
Serene and far removed
from the false glitter

1450
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:06,360
the raucous music and the neon lights
of this modern world.

1451
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:11,526
We are both young, white
and in perfect health.

1452
01:23:11,596 --> 01:23:17,760
Stanley, I've gotta hand it to you.
That's real specifying.

1453
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,853
You've come up with the one formula
that I, as the devil, really dread:

1454
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
mutual love
and spiritual values.

1455
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:32,000
I want peace and quiet
and no other men in her life.

1456
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,700
Julie Andrews.

1457
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,700
Shh!

1458
01:23:44,363 --> 01:23:47,124
Welcome to the Berelian Order, Sister Luna.

1459
01:23:47,196 --> 01:23:50,628
Until you are initiated,
you will wear the habit of a novice.

1460
01:23:50,696 --> 01:23:53,526
We must speak no more.

1461
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:53,191
The order of the Leaping Berelians
is new and nondenominational.

1462
01:25:53,263 --> 01:25:56,388
Our patron, Beryl of Sussex,
was a simple shepherdess.

1463
01:25:56,463 --> 01:25:59,917
One afternoon she saw a vision
in the sky which beckoned her.

1464
01:25:59,996 --> 01:26:03,019
Dropping her crook,
she leaped towards the vision,

1465
01:26:03,096 --> 01:26:06,584
which, ever receding and ever beckoning,
urged her upwards

1466
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:09,026
until she disappeared
into the clouds.

1467
01:26:09,096 --> 01:26:11,860
This miracle was witnessed
by a two-year-old child

1468
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:16,118
who ran to the spot and picked up
Beryl's shoes that had fallen to the Earth.

1469
01:26:16,196 --> 01:26:18,991
That child founded this order

1470
01:26:19,063 --> 01:26:21,620
whose Sisters have taken
a vow of silence

1471
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:25,026
until such time
as Beryl of Sussex is canonised

1472
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:29,926
and recognised by the people of the world
for her tremendous feat.

1473
01:26:47,029 --> 01:26:50,961
<i>What is this feeling</i>
<i>that overwhelms me?</i>

1474
01:26:51,029 --> 01:26:53,188
<i>It is something new</i>
<i>and strange.</i>

1475
01:26:53,263 --> 01:26:57,286
<i>It is love, oh, my most cherished.</i>
<i>I see it in your eyes.</i>

1476
01:26:57,363 --> 01:27:02,159
<i>This is love profane. Must be sin in me</i>
<i>that so confounds my senses.</i>

1477
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:04,957
<i>There is no sin in love, my darling.</i>

1478
01:27:05,029 --> 01:27:07,461
<i>And I love you for all eternity.</i>

1479
01:27:07,529 --> 01:27:10,927
-Margaret.
-<i>You know my name.</i>

1480
01:27:10,996 --> 01:27:12,928
<i>What magic is afoot?</i>

1481
01:27:12,996 --> 01:27:17,122
<i>Our love is written in the book of fate.</i>
<i>There is no escaping it.</i>

1482
01:27:17,196 --> 01:27:19,185
<i>This can't be right</i>

1483
01:27:19,263 --> 01:27:23,661
<i>and yet, within my breast</i>
<i>beats such desire.</i>

1484
01:27:23,729 --> 01:27:26,661
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>
<i>Just trust in me.</i>

1485
01:27:26,729 --> 01:27:29,025
<i>Allow your heart to speak.</i>

1486
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:19,500
<i>You must go through the initiation ceremony</i>
<i>to show your faith.</i>

1487
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,721
<i>But I'm afraid of heights.</i>

1488
01:28:21,761 --> 01:28:23,986
<i>Show your courage in your leaping.</i>

1489
01:29:47,063 --> 01:29:51,325
I didn't go to vespers.
I had to see if you were all right.

1490
01:29:51,396 --> 01:29:54,362
Oh, Margaret, my precious.
At last we're alone. We can speak.

1491
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:57,260
But only this once.

1492
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:00,659
Whatever it is that draws us together
we must cast out.

1493
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,991
It is unnatural and wrong.

1494
01:30:03,063 --> 01:30:06,188
How can it be wrong
if we love each other?

1495
01:30:06,263 --> 01:30:08,229
It is wrong

1496
01:30:08,296 --> 01:30:11,262
and I'm so ashamed to break my vow.

1497
01:30:11,330 --> 01:30:14,557
I came here to find peace and quiet

1498
01:30:14,629 --> 01:30:16,618
and faith.

1499
01:30:16,696 --> 01:30:19,924
-And have you found it?
-Not yet.

1500
01:30:19,996 --> 01:30:25,060
However hard I try
I can't believe that God exists.

1501
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:27,800
But he does exist.
I know that for certain.

1502
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,321
-How can you be so sure?
-Because I've met the devil.

1503
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:33,800
-The devil?
-Yeah.

1504
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:37,827
Let me tell you what happened to me.
I used to be a man.

1505
01:30:37,896 --> 01:30:41,623
My name was Stanley Moon,
and I was a short order cook.

1506
01:30:41,696 --> 01:30:45,094
I was very much in love with you,
but I was too shy to tell you.

1507
01:30:45,163 --> 01:30:47,856
I've never seen you before today.

1508
01:30:47,929 --> 01:30:51,191
I got so miserable
that I tried to kill myself.

1509
01:30:51,263 --> 01:30:54,990
And then George came along
and offered me seven wishes for my soul.

1510
01:30:55,063 --> 01:30:57,824
-Who is George?
-Well, he's the devil.

1511
01:30:57,896 --> 01:31:00,092
We're very good friends.

1512
01:31:00,132 --> 01:31:02,329
He's not so bad
when you understand his problems.

1513
01:31:02,396 --> 01:31:04,362
That's why I keep going—

1514
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:06,362
'Cause I usually disappear
when I go—

1515
01:31:06,430 --> 01:31:10,453
I find that as hard to believe
as all that about Beryl and her leap.

1516
01:31:10,529 --> 01:31:13,757
But it's true.
And I've got one wish to go.

1517
01:31:13,829 --> 01:31:16,795
I can't think what's happened to George.
Look.

1518
01:31:16,863 --> 01:31:19,022
You see? Nothing.

1519
01:31:19,096 --> 01:31:21,891
I just hope it's not too late.

1520
01:31:23,396 --> 01:31:25,103
I love you, Margaret.

1521
01:31:25,143 --> 01:31:26,850
And I love you, Sister Luna.

1522
01:31:26,929 --> 01:31:30,054
And my love will last forever.

1523
01:31:30,129 --> 01:31:33,526
But it can never be fulfilled.

1524
01:31:36,096 --> 01:31:39,187
I must find George
before he goes to heaven.

1525
01:31:40,263 --> 01:31:42,320
Good evening, Sister.

1526
01:31:53,263 --> 01:31:54,941
We gave already!

1527
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,700
Let me in! Let me in!

1528
01:31:59,729 --> 01:32:02,360
Take that, you great git!

1529
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,000
Sorry, Father.

1530
01:32:07,829 --> 01:32:11,989
Can I be of any help? Oh!

1531
01:32:12,063 --> 01:32:14,154
Wake up, George!

1532
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:16,695
George, wake up.

1533
01:32:16,762 --> 01:32:19,092
Thank goodness you're still here.

1534
01:32:19,163 --> 01:32:23,788
I was just having
a bit of a nap before the party.

1535
01:32:23,863 --> 01:32:26,761
I've done it.
I've got me hundred billion.

1536
01:32:26,829 --> 01:32:30,360
Oh, congratulations.
Look, what went wrong?

1537
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:33,293
I blew my raspberry hundreds of times,
and nothing happened.

1538
01:32:33,363 --> 01:32:34,837
I still got
one more wish to go, you know.

1539
01:32:34,877 --> 01:32:36,352
How'd you figure that out?

1540
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:40,226
I was the intellectual,
I was Sir Stanley Moon, the businessman,

1541
01:32:40,296 --> 01:32:44,319
I was the fly, the pop singer,
the student, and this one makes six.

1542
01:32:44,396 --> 01:32:47,800
What about the Frobisher and Gleason
raspberry-flavoured ice lolly?

1543
01:32:48,200 --> 01:32:50,209
That didn't count!

1544
01:32:50,249 --> 01:32:52,195
Of course it did.
It was a wish, wasn't it?

1545
01:32:52,263 --> 01:32:54,320
That reminds me.

1546
01:32:54,396 --> 01:32:56,385
I owe you sixpence.

1547
01:32:58,296 --> 01:33:00,900
Here we are. Now we're even.

1548
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,660
Then I'm stuck as a woman?

1549
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:03,900
As a nun.

1550
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,858
You should have specified the sex.

1551
01:33:11,430 --> 01:33:15,521
You've won, haven't you, George?
Well, if I can't have Margaret, I'll kill myself.

1552
01:33:15,596 --> 01:33:18,926
Sorry, Stanley.
It's out of the question.

1553
01:33:18,996 --> 01:33:21,791
Whatever you are on your last wish
you remain forever.

1554
01:33:52,529 --> 01:33:56,155
Isn't this a terrific party?

1555
01:33:56,230 --> 01:34:00,185
Terrific for some, ducky.
Look at the lousy table I've got.

1556
01:34:22,396 --> 01:34:27,259
-Come on, sweetie. Let's dance.
-No, thank you.

1557
01:34:36,396 --> 01:34:39,260
-You're going now, George?
-Yes, Stanley.

1558
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:43,760
I thought I'd just sneak away quietly.
I don't want to spoil the party.

1559
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,000
Well, I hope you get back in.

1560
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:49,060
You know, upstairs.

1561
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:51,120
Thank you very much.

1562
01:34:51,196 --> 01:34:54,525
Apart from Margaret, you're the only
person I've ever enjoyed talking to.

1563
01:34:54,596 --> 01:34:58,926
Now you're going, and...
Well, I can't talk to her.

1564
01:34:58,996 --> 01:35:00,962
I'll rather miss you.

1565
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:03,359
I'll miss you too, Stanley.

1566
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:07,759
You know, looking around
the party at everybody

1567
01:35:07,829 --> 01:35:11,625
all of them trying to be something
they weren't in the first place.

1568
01:35:11,696 --> 01:35:15,788
All I want to be is me,
what I was before I met you.

1569
01:35:15,863 --> 01:35:19,955
But that's impossible.
You can't be that without your soul.

1570
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:24,800
Being me didn't seem like
very much at the time.

1571
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:29,300
Well, it wasn't very much, but it's
a good deal better than the alternatives.

1572
01:35:31,163 --> 01:35:35,095
I'd give anything to be myself again.

1573
01:35:36,796 --> 01:35:40,711
But I don't have anything to give,
really, do I?

1574
01:35:42,445 --> 01:35:44,434
Look, I'll tell you what, Stanley.

1575
01:35:44,511 --> 01:35:47,307
I've got me hundred billion souls
and a few to spare.

1576
01:35:47,378 --> 01:35:51,300
I don't really need yours.
It's not much of a catch.
I can give it to you back again.

1577
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,473
Is it possible?

1578
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:57,375
It's never been done before.
It's a very magnanimous gesture.

1579
01:35:57,445 --> 01:36:00,933
In fact, it's a glorious gesture.

1580
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:03,860
Part of my new image.
Here we are.

1581
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,807
I knew you weren't all bad.

1582
01:36:05,878 --> 01:36:09,060
Of course not. I've just been
thoroughly misunderstood.

1583
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:11,360
Now, then take this,
burn it up,

1584
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:14,000
and when it's all gone
you'll be Stanley Moon again.

1585
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:18,000
Short order chef,
Caucasian, 28, male.

1586
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,600
-And what about Margaret?
-She'll be at Wimpy's as usual.

1587
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:23,700
Nobody will know
that any of this has ever happened.

1588
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:27,900
-You're an angel, George.
-Here's hoping.

1589
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:32,260
Do me a favour, Stanley.
Look after the party for me.
See everybody has a good time.

1590
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:33,660
When that's done,
it's over to you.

1591
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:35,500
I'll do my best.

1592
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,875
-Bye, George.
-Bye, Stanley.

1593
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:48,800
§ I'm so good and kind and pretty
I'll be his favourite one again §

1594
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:11,200
-Hello, my good man.
Are you Saint Peter?  -Yes.

1595
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,400
-I'd like to see God, please.
-Who shall I say is calling?

1596
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,860
Oh, come on. You know me.

1597
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:18,008
Beelzebub, Lucifer, Prince of Darkness.

1598
01:37:18,078 --> 01:37:20,601
-Have you an appointment?
-He's always got time for me.

1599
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,124
I'll just see if he's—

1600
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:25,500
Don't say you'll just see if he's in.
Of course he's in.

1601
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:27,700
Blimey, how did you get this job?

1602
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,260
-Would you wait here, sir?
-Hurry up then!

1603
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:34,660
If I were you wanting to get in,
I should try being a bit more humble.

1604
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:36,860
Oh, would you really? Yes.

1605
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,400
I dare say you would.
You're quite right, of course.

1606
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:42,300
I'll throw a bit of filth over myself.
That should please him.

1607
01:37:47,800 --> 01:37:51,800
-He'll see you now.
-Oh, thank you very much.

1608
01:37:58,845 --> 01:38:01,072
Hello!

1609
01:38:01,144 --> 01:38:03,474
God!

1610
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:06,102
It's me.

1611
01:38:06,178 --> 01:38:09,576
Where are you?

1612
01:38:09,645 --> 01:38:13,543
I wish you'd manifest yourself a bit.
It's so hard just talking to thin air.

1613
01:38:13,611 --> 01:38:18,407
On thy belly shalt thou go!

1614
01:38:18,478 --> 01:38:21,205
Oh, blimey. You're not still on
about that, are you?

1615
01:38:21,278 --> 01:38:23,121
All right.

1616
01:38:23,161 --> 01:38:25,005
Dust shalt thou eat!

1617
01:38:25,078 --> 01:38:27,374
Oh, naturally, yes.
Dust, of course. What else?

1618
01:38:27,445 --> 01:38:31,000
Mmm. Delicious.
This is very good. Num, num, num.

1619
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,900
Speak!

1620
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:36,160
It's a bit difficult
with all this dust in my mouth

1621
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,310
but I've come about readmission.

1622
01:38:38,378 --> 01:38:40,844
You know, I'm ready to
come back in again and join you.

1623
01:38:40,911 --> 01:38:45,367
Hast thou, in thy purpose,
swayed or wavered?

1624
01:38:45,445 --> 01:38:47,741
Swayed or wavered?

1625
01:38:47,812 --> 01:38:51,937
Just take a look at the world.
It's never been in such a mess.

1626
01:38:52,011 --> 01:38:53,860
I've done a wonderful job.

1627
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:57,273
People are killing each other,
lusting after each other's wives,

1628
01:38:57,344 --> 01:38:59,276
worshipping false idols.

1629
01:38:59,344 --> 01:39:03,743
I've done a marvellous job. It's never been
so sinful, miserable and perverted.

1630
01:39:03,812 --> 01:39:07,437
You should be very happy.

1631
01:39:07,511 --> 01:39:11,170
Oh, don't go forming yourself
into a whirlwind

1632
01:39:11,244 --> 01:39:14,074
just 'cause I got to
a hundred billion souls first.

1633
01:39:14,144 --> 01:39:17,804
Somebody's got to lose. Oh, I'll tell you
something that'll really please you.

1634
01:39:17,878 --> 01:39:21,435
I've done a good deed.
I gave that little twit his soul back.

1635
01:39:21,511 --> 01:39:25,841
Wasn't that generous?
Made me feel marvellous!

1636
01:39:25,911 --> 01:39:28,707
Well, come on. Am I in?

1637
01:39:29,944 --> 01:39:32,900
Hello. Where are you?

1638
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:34,639
This way, please.

1639
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:36,341
What's happening?

1640
01:39:36,411 --> 01:39:39,300
One moment he was talking to me,
the next moment he was gone.

1641
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,071
I'm afraid you failed
the entrance examination.

1642
01:39:42,144 --> 01:39:45,508
I can't have failed.
I've done everything he asked of me.

1643
01:39:45,578 --> 01:39:48,339
And to show how repentant I was,
I even did a good deed.

1644
01:39:48,411 --> 01:39:51,844
Made me feel marvellous,
just like I was in the old days.

1645
01:39:51,911 --> 01:39:55,571
There you are. It sounds as if you made
a good gesture for the wrong motives.

1646
01:39:55,645 --> 01:39:57,235
What do you mean,
"wrong motives"?

1647
01:39:57,311 --> 01:40:00,607
For your own joy, to make you
feel better than someone else.

1648
01:40:00,678 --> 01:40:03,905
Oh. Well, I can fix that.

1649
01:40:03,977 --> 01:40:07,637
I'll get Stanley to give me his soul back,
then return it for the right reasons.

1650
01:40:07,712 --> 01:40:10,900
I won't be proud. Tell God not to go away.
I'll be back in a minute.

1651
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,604
Stanley! Hold everything!

1652
01:40:19,678 --> 01:40:22,838
Stanley! Stanley!

1653
01:40:22,911 --> 01:40:27,310
Where are you?
It's me, George, your old friend.

1654
01:40:27,378 --> 01:40:30,160
I want your soul back.
Just for a second.

1655
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:33,410
Then I'll give it to you back in a better way.
I promise you. Where are you?

1656
01:40:33,478 --> 01:40:35,706
Stanley!

1657
01:40:35,778 --> 01:40:38,869
Are you in there?
It's not a trick.

1658
01:40:38,944 --> 01:40:40,535
Stanley!

1659
01:40:40,611 --> 01:40:43,270
Stanley, wait!

1660
01:40:43,344 --> 01:40:45,300
Stanley!

1661
01:40:59,611 --> 01:41:01,770
<i>I'm gonna do it.</i>

1662
01:41:01,845 --> 01:41:04,333
<i>This time I'm going to do it.</i>

1663
01:41:04,411 --> 01:41:07,605
<i>I've got to do it.</i>
<i>I know I can and I know I will.</i>

1664
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:11,360
<i>Here I go. Now!</i>

1665
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:13,157
Miss Spencer!

1666
01:41:13,197 --> 01:41:14,200
What, Stanley?

1667
01:41:17,244 --> 01:41:20,039
I wonder if you'd like to come
and have dinner with me tonight.

1668
01:41:20,111 --> 01:41:23,400
Sorry. I'm already doing something.
Another night perhaps.

1669
01:41:28,278 --> 01:41:33,100
Stanley. Stanley.
She could make it tonight. I could fix it.

1670
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:37,400
Tonight and every night.
I've got a new deal for you.

1671
01:41:43,578 --> 01:41:47,374
No, thanks, George.
I'd like to try it my way.

1672
01:41:51,511 --> 01:41:53,636
What a triumph.

1673
01:41:53,712 --> 01:41:55,900
Very funny.

1674
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,774
All right, you great git.
You've asked for it.

1675
01:42:00,845 --> 01:42:04,834
I'll cover the world
in Tastee-Freez and Wimpy Burgers.

1676
01:42:04,911 --> 01:42:08,742
I'll fill it full of concrete runways,
motorways,

1677
01:42:08,812 --> 01:42:11,902
aircraft, television
and automobiles,

1678
01:42:11,977 --> 01:42:15,205
advertising, plastic flowers
and frozen food,

1679
01:42:15,278 --> 01:42:17,210
supersonic bangs...

1680
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:22,700
I'll make it so noisy and disgusting
that even you'll be ashamed of yourself.

1681
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:25,960
No wonder you've so few friends.

1682
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,200
You're unbelievable.
