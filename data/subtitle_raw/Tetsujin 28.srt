Mr. Matsukawa!

25
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,616
Mr. Matsukawa!
Go to your seat!

26
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,350
Yes, ma'am.

27
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,652
Sorry, ma'am.

28
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:06,469
Mr. Kaneda, what are you drawing?

29
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:10,243
Didn't I tell you not to copy
pictures or illustrations?

30
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,285
I'm drawing what I see.

31
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,481
Wow! What's that?

32
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,388
That's cool.

33
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,122
Is this what you see?
It's just eating birdseed.

34
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,994
Don't lie, newcomer!

35
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:27,362
Hey!

36
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,564
I saw it flap its wings.

37
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,902
Yeah, for a split second!
He couldn't have seen the details.

38
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,373
Say, everyone, do you think
he can look this clear?

39
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,075
Class!

40
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,578
Come on! Stop that!

41
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,245
Quiet now!

42
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,381
Quiet!

43
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,423
The teacher said to be quiet!

44
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,557
Go back to your task!

45
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,255
If you can't decide,
go ahead and buy one.

46
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,364
It's the pleasures
of Japanese summer.

47
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,262
This one matches you.

48
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,632
Well... I'll take this!

49
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,161
Ah! You scared me!

50
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,670
- I'm home.
- Don't scare me like that!

51
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,335
I'm not a kid anymore.

52
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:24,477
Phew. I'm home.

53
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,018
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

54
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:33,252
Hey, good job!
I'm certainly impressed.

55
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,054
Maybe I'll ask you
to do it every day.

56
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,759
Stop joking and get dinner ready.
I'm starving!

57
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,668
The fact you're starving
means you're in good health!

58
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,916
You silly boy,
wearing it inside out.

59
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,418
Shotaro drew a masterpiece again.

60
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,760
Everyone was saying
that drawing stinks.

61
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,557
Let them say what they want. Right?

62
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,892
Thank you for the food!

63
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,263
Teriyaki, again?

64
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:18,132
So? As long as it's tasty,
it should be fine.

65
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:25,033
Thank you for the food.

66
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,615
So, have you made new friends?

67
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:34,812
Not really.

68
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,553
I do feel bad.

69
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,992
I didn't think there'd be transfers
for jobs in cooking schools.

70
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:52,064
Don't make an ugly face.
That's why you can't make new friends.

71
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,504
Do you think you'll make it
in the new school?

72
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,099
I guess I'll just have to. Right?

73
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,938
<i>I am standing in front of...
You sound just like your father.</i>

74
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:04,972
<i>Reiji Takumi's house...</i>

75
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,315
<i>the former president of
the computer company KOK.
Pass me the teriyaki.</i>

76
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,547
<i>The cause of this damage
is not clear...</i>

77
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:15,788
<i>but there are
several witnesses saying...</i>

78
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,956
<i>that they saw a giant arm-shaped
metallic object fly into the sky.</i>

79
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:23,569
<i>Reporting Live from the site
There is a big hole about
5 meters diameter in the roof...</i>

80
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,059
<i>There is a big hole about
5 meters diameter in the roof...</i>

81
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:28,595
<i>and it appears that the words of
the witnesses do make sense.</i>

82
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,108
Reporting live from the house of
Reiji Takumi, former KOK President
The police are investigating the case.

83
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:34,010
The police believe that Mr. Takumi,
who is currently missing...

84
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,447
<i>might have something to do with it.</i>

85
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,116
<i>- We'll be on air soon with updates.</i>

86
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:40,743
<i>- We'll be on air soon with updates.
- Is something wrong?</i>

87
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,151
Why did you turn it off?

88
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,688
Well, let's eat.

89
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,954
Hey, sit up straight.

90
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:40,407
Uh, Kaneda-kun.

91
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,468
Huh?

92
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,316
You like R/C model airplanes too?

93
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,510
Yeah.

94
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,578
You're really good at it.

95
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,351
Not that good.
I've dropped it so many times.

96
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,954
Um, listen...

97
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,188
What?

98
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,962
Not everyone in our school is mean.

99
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:05,604
What?

100
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,608
Hey, I know a good joke.

101
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,144
Joke?

102
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,736
Do you know a clock that talks?

103
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,246
What's that?

104
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:20,752
Tick-tack, tick-tack, tic... talk!

105
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,447
That's dull!

106
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,250
Tick-tack, tick-tack...

107
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,917
Talk! Talk! Talk!

108
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,692
There's a wolf in the bathroom.
Tell me what it said.

109
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,325
There can't be a wolf in the bathroom!

110
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,562
"How'll" I do without toilet paper?

111
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,967
There's no way a giant iron arm bigger
than a dump truck can fly through the air!

112
00:10:44,443 --> 00:10:46,502
There's so many people saying
they actually saw it.

113
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,410
Do you think that they'd all lie together?

114
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,573
I don't mean that, but...

115
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,418
Anyway, it's a huge basement.

116
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,752
Maybe they were playing soccer.

117
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,694
Do you wanna go out
for a drink after this?

118
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,425
I know a good place nearby.

119
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,592
- Mr. Murasame.
- Yes, ma'am.

120
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,794
You're fired!

121
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,069
Hey!

122
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,903
Did you find out anything?

123
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,500
There's a gym-size lab
in the basement...

124
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:20,602
and it seems that
the giant arm flew from there.

125
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,444
- What about Reiji Takumi?
- We haven't found him yet.

126
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:28,680
A giant arm. "All become Zero."
What's going on here?

127
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,278
Hey!

128
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,120
- "All become zero"?
- Zero?

129
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:39,523
"All become zero."
What could this mean?

130
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,533
<i>At 3:47 this afternoon
for about 2 minutes...</i>

131
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:46,662
<i>the land broadcast system was hijacked
by an unidentified source...</i>

132
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:49,173
<i>and the mysterious message
was on air.</i>

133
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,731
<i>The police,
joined by all the TV stations...</i>

134
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:56,308
Come here quickly,
we're celebrating.

135
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,128
I baked this at cooking school.

136
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,390
- Can I open it?
- Sure.

137
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,597
Whoa! Looks good!

138
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,303
Get the candles ready.

139
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,573
Where are they?

140
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,908
Oops. I forgot to buy them.

141
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,470
That's my mom.

142
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,984
What should we do?

143
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,850
Ah! I've got an idea.

144
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,420
Will this do?

145
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,689
Yeah, that'll do.

146
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:56,270
Birthday cakes won't do
without candles.

147
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,469
- Turn off the lights.
- Sure.

148
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,323
- Let's sing "Happy birthday".
- Mom...

149
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:23,831
There's... something
I want to ask you.

150
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:25,370
What is it?

151
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,871
I've been having weird dreams lately.

152
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:32,968
Weird dreams?

153
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:40,077
There's a small me
in a semi-dark, huge room...

154
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,120
and there's electric sparkles.

155
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,281
And then I see two giant poles
shaped like legs...

156
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,361
and someone is suddenly
staring at me angrily.

157
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,432
That someone is my dad.

158
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,378
He pushes me away and disappears.

159
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,524
Did this dream happen for real?

160
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,795
Why did my dad do that to me?

161
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,494
Did he hate me?

162
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,504
How could that be true?

163
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,586
Reiji Takumi's company, KOK,
was enormously big, wasn't it?

164
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:59,291
KOK was not just a company.
It was a kingdom. Takumi Kingdom.

165
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:03,096
Takumi was controlling
his computer business all by himself.

166
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:13,138
But that Takumi Kingdom was
shattered into pieces.

167
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:22,350
It was triggered by KOK's new computers
that repeatedly malfunctioned.

168
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:27,757
The media that praised Takumi had
suddenly turned their hands over him.

169
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:30,727
The sales of KOK's computer declined
and the value of stocks collapsed.

170
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,396
Takumi suddenly sold
the company three years ago...

171
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,265
and disappeared from the world.

172
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,932
And then, a big arm from his house?

173
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:43,338
I don't get it.

174
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:49,303
What are you grinning about?
You're creepy.

175
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,077
Well, I just thought
we're all alone right now.

176
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,784
We can see far away!

177
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,254
Hi, everyone. Here's the mascot
of Tokyo Tower.

178
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,985
Look, it's Noppon. Noppon!

179
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,007
- What's the matter?
- What's that?

180
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,876
Maybe it's some ad.

181
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,724
Takahashi, run. Hurry!

182
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,951
Hurry!

183
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,091
Megumi! Come on!

184
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:05,994
Bye-bye!

185
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,557
Amazing!

186
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,646
Everyone, please stop
what you're doing.

187
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:47,658
There was a big accident nearby
and an evacuation order was issued.

188
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:51,999
It's very dangerous here.
Please go home immediately.

189
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:53,793
It's a robot!

190
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,062
Run!

191
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,689
Mrs. Kaneda,
what are you doing? Hurry!

192
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:05,974
Excuse me! Excuse me!

193
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:21,358
Mr. Furuta! Can you hear me?

194
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,467
Mom!

195
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:32,926
Mom...

196
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:36,704
You must be Shotaro.

197
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,070
She is just sleeping
from the medicine.

198
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,114
She had me worried there
for a while...

199
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,845
but the doctor said she just fractured
her leg and bruised her back.

200
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,889
Your mother...

201
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:01,163
She froze where she was
the minute she heard the word "robot."

202
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,035
Why didn't she run away?

203
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,339
Mr. Taura, the Tokyo Metropolitan
Police Commissioner, has arrived.

204
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,349
Is it true that the criminals
made the statement?

205
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,351
Have you identified the robot?

206
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,716
Please give us your comment!

207
00:25:25,223 --> 00:25:26,952
<i>Giant Robot Terrorism Task Force HQs
Later, okay?</i>

208
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,028
Everyone, please be quiet.

209
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,437
Everyone, please be quiet.

210
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:48,104
Members of the media community!
Please step back.

211
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,273
- Good morning, sirs.
- Good morning!

212
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,578
Please be seated.

213
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,051
"All Become Zero."

214
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:09,494
"Black Ox will take over Tokyo
two weeks later."

215
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,557
"Good luck."

216
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,334
Someone hacked into the homepage
of the Metropolitan Police...

217
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:19,935
and a person who calls himself
"Zero" sent us this message.

218
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,771
Black Ox? In two weeks?

219
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,378
As you all may know...

220
00:26:28,453 --> 00:26:30,978
the terrorist, Zero...

221
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:38,528
has sent a giant robot,
Black Ox already.

222
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:43,728
And has brought tremendous disaster
to the city of Tokyo.

223
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,769
- To warn of an attack in two weeks...

224
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:46,998
- To warn of an attack in two weeks...
- Did you hear?

225
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:50,269
They're inviting a counter-terrorism
specialist to our department.

226
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,604
Really?

227
00:26:56,281 --> 00:27:01,776
Supposed to be top-notch in
computer and robot technology at MIT.

228
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:06,722
It sucks! Sounds like we underlings
are not needed to solve the case.

229
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,019
Yeah, sort of.

230
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:15,564
Ah! Looks like he's already here.

231
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,534
I'm out of business cards right now.

232
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:22,730
Hello.

233
00:27:22,841 --> 00:27:23,830
Hello.

234
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,398
Hello.

235
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,308
I'm Ejima of the Investigation Division.

236
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,313
I'm Murasame in the same division.

237
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:32,873
- I'm...
- Well, he's not the one.

238
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:36,751
He's Dr. Kawai, the assistant
to the specialist, Mami Tachibana.

239
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,516
I'm Kawai.

240
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,887
There she is.

241
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,949
Over here.

242
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,654
She's come upon our special request.

243
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,131
This is Ms. Mami Tachibana from MIT.

244
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,961
Oh, she is?

245
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,606
I'm Mami. Nice to meet you.

246
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:01,269
What a beautiful girl!

247
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:06,479
Let me get straight to the point.
Did you find out anything?

248
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:10,214
You smell like tobacco.
You'll die young.

249
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,119
What?

250
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,023
I think this is made by Reiji Takumi.

251
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:16,458
- What?
- What?

252
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,092
The very person that made Black Ox
must be Reiji Takumi.

253
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,760
There's no one else that can build
this kind of robot.

254
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:27,871
Then "Zero" is Reiji Takumi?

255
00:28:28,606 --> 00:28:30,039
Who the heck is Takumi?

256
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,945
He's the world authority in
artificial intelligence research.

257
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,676
He is the genius of all geniuses.

258
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,758
<i>Shoichiro Kaneda</i>

259
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,585
Hello? Kaneda residence.

260
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,349
You must be Shotaro Kaneda.

261
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:54,782
Yes.

262
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,419
My name is Ayabe.

263
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:04,230
I want to meet with you to talk about
what he has left for you.

264
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:05,291
Pardon?

265
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,861
You must be Mr. Shotaro Kaneda.

266
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,000
Yes.

267
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,263
Step into the car, please.

268
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:41,005
Please.

269
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:25,738
I brought him, sir.

270
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,555
So you're Shotaro Kaneda.

271
00:31:36,694 --> 00:31:39,390
You've grown.

272
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,431
Pardon?

273
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:42,759
I am Ayabe.

274
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,204
Please come.

275
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,692
I used to be...

276
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,092
an assistant for your grandfather...

277
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,461
Dr. Shogoro Kaneda...

278
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:22,232
and a guardian for your father,
Dr. Shoichiro Kaneda.

279
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:32,040
My life has always been
with the Kaneda family...

280
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:39,813
but I never thought I'd come
back here while I was alive.

281
00:32:55,173 --> 00:33:01,134
This is your father's laboratory.

282
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,502
What?

283
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,185
Please, go on ahead.

284
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:09,775
You've been here before.

285
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:11,910
I have?

286
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,468
You remember now, don't you?

287
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,381
This is Tetsujin No. 28.

288
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:41,332
The first Tetsujin was made by
your grandfather for military use.

289
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,375
Then your father took over...

290
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:48,674
and remade it many times, wishing
it be used for peaceful purposes...

291
00:35:50,047 --> 00:35:56,919
and finally completed
this 28th robot.

292
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:06,963
You must know where the device
to control this robot was put away.

293
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:44,058
That is the remote-controller
to operate Tetsujin.

294
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:51,427
You used your power as an eidetic...

295
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:55,632
and accurately recalled
your memories as a three-year-old.

296
00:37:56,807 --> 00:38:00,538
"E-E-Eidetic"?

297
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,580
It's a person with the skills of inputting
what you see as you see it...

298
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:08,449
and recalling those memories
accurately anytime you wish.

299
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:12,148
You are going to use that skill
to operate Tetsujin.

300
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:18,654
Your father left Tetsujin for you.

301
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,556
What?

302
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,695
I don't believe that.

303
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:31,541
You'll understand soon enough.
Now, push the buttons.

304
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:33,076
That can't be.

305
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,204
Why should my father leave it to me?

306
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:41,144
You're a coward unlike your father!

307
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,182
Coward?

308
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,925
No way!

309
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:35,431
<i>All units on patrol!
Black Ox has appeared in Kasumigaseki.</i>

310
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:38,566
<i>All vehicles to respond immediately!
All units on patrol!</i>

311
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,182
There he is!

312
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,654
There he is! Ready?

313
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:56,386
Black Ox is coming this way!

314
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:03,628
Terrorist Zero's destroyer is about
to attack the town of Kasumigaseki!

315
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,504
Don't back down! Stay on!

316
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,597
Stay on!

317
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,617
Let's shoot it!

318
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,183
Open fire!

319
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:37,965
It's not working.

320
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,565
Huh? What is that?

321
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,780
Are you sure I'm the one to do this?

322
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,056
Of course.

323
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:02,411
Shotaro, what are you doing?

324
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:04,010
Quick! Make Tetsujin move.

325
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:05,077
Yes, sir!

326
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:26,304
That robot is fighting against Black Ox.

327
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:52,059
I can't do this!

328
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:59,703
Damn you!

329
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:00,971
Let's go.

330
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:03,013
- Hurry!
- Get in position!

331
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,780
Shotaro!

332
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,255
Don't take your hands off
the remote-controller!

333
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:48,291
What?

334
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,452
It's the only lifeline for Tetsujin.

335
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:51,494
Yes, sir.

336
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,340
Tetsujin...

337
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,560
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

338
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:12,442
Damn it!

339
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,660
This is unbelievable!

340
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:48,194
The Diet Building, the symbol of
the government for 68 years...

341
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:51,105
is going to be destroyed?!

342
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,962
You might have meant
to fight Black Ox...

343
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,500
but all you did
is cause more damage!

344
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:55,629
We don't want you bringing out
such a worthless robot without a permit!

345
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,503
Worthless robot?

346
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:59,667
You watch your mouth!

347
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,802
Call him the great Tetsujin No. 28.

348
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:05,042
I don't know if it's called Tetsujin
or whatever...

349
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:09,108
but what were you thinking,
letting that little boy control that thing?

350
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,485
Anyway, you've violated the law.

351
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:15,525
You'll certainly receive
harsh punishment. So be ready.

352
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,822
I'll be ready.

353
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,386
Hey, you, get off there. Quick!

354
00:48:21,865 --> 00:48:25,858
I also have a lot of things to say to you.

355
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,733
Do you know
what'll happen to Tetsujin?

356
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:31,001
There's already an order
to destroy it immediately.

357
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:34,566
Hey, boy, come over here.

358
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:38,411
Never mind. Come on, old man.
We got to give you a hearing.

359
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:39,471
All right.

360
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,715
This way.

361
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:43,013
Come over here.

362
00:48:51,995 --> 00:48:53,758
Are you the one
who was operating Tetsujin?

363
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,594
Yes.

364
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:59,636
You were terrible.

365
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,703
- Just as I thought.
- Let's destroy it.

366
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:48,512
No one can build a robot
that can withstand Black Ox.

367
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:52,612
My ideal world will not come true
unless everything is destroyed.

368
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,952
What's after Tokyo?

369
00:49:58,095 --> 00:50:03,863
My greatest ideal world will be
controlled by my computers.

370
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:07,631
New York? Or London?

371
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,501
What's your wish?

372
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:35,816
That's what we call
"addicted to nicotine."

373
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,887
Oh, shut up.

374
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:44,729
We'll be transporting Tetsujin
to Mr. Ayabe's lab.

375
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:47,897
So you'll be demolishing it there?

376
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:50,565
We're not going to demolish him.
We'll rebuild him.

377
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,536
What the heck did you say?

378
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,737
We've obtained permission
from the office.

379
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:57,507
There's no question of responsibility
to you, Chief Ohtsuka!

380
00:51:57,581 --> 00:51:58,605
What?

381
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,913
I'm going to make Tetsujin
strong enough to defeat Black Ox.

382
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,285
Won't you to help us, Mr. Ayabe?

383
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:06,879
Rebuild Tetsujin?

384
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:10,860
Really?

385
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,934
Can you check the knees?

386
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,870
Say, this is EMP, isn't it?

387
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:28,840
The one that Black Ox
exposed Tetsujin to.

388
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:29,879
EMP?

389
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:35,311
That's why Tetsujin's electric circuits
were damaged and couldn't be controlled.

390
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,818
I have to admit, Black Ox is powerful.

391
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,416
Well, but...

392
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:50,066
Tetsujin's head was not crushed
when Black Ox stepped on him.

393
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:53,728
These workmen
put their souls into Tetsujin.

394
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:59,004
I definitely wish...

395
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:02,374
to rebuild Tetsujin.

396
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:04,947
Any objection?

397
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,119
I'm looking forward
to working with you!

398
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,258
Tetsujin is awesome!

399
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:17,054
He's probably much stronger
than we imagine.

400
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:20,127
He lost the other day...

401
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,825
but if he really shows what he's got,
he'll definitely knock Black Ox down.

402
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:25,994
Don't you think so?

403
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:30,700
Tetsujin is the worst.

404
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:31,832
What?

405
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,271
Do you want to see Tetsujin?
