15
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:50,616
Child.

16
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:53,957
She's healthy.

17
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:56,564
A healthy baby boy.

18
00:04:57,828 --> 00:05:00,975
This is truly the biggest
miracle for us, Joseph.

19
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:05,109
We have waited for a long time.

20
00:05:06,625 --> 00:05:08,011
We always prayed.

21
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:12,674
Our prayers were answered, Joseph.

22
00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:21,271
Will we name him after the
name we have talked about before?

23
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:24,208
Your father's name?

24
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:28,672
Yes.

25
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,488
Nicholas Perez.

26
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,398
Alonso-Lopez.

27
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,731
I hope to live to see
him become a doctor.

28
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:42,225
He needs to pursue

29
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:44,850
the tradition of the Alonso-Lopez.

30
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:48,365
Famous doctors.

31
00:05:49,551 --> 00:05:50,601
In San Miguel.

32
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:53,826
Aunt Is hang?

33
00:05:56,972 --> 00:05:59,590
I will name her Alexandra.

34
00:06:02,893 --> 00:06:05,724
I truly regret that her
father won't see her.

35
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:08,990
I regret it.

36
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:10,327
Never mind, Natalia.

37
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:14,377
Besides,

38
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:16,000
he can see you.

39
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:21,363
Especially now that you
even named the child after him.

40
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:25,688
At my age now,

41
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,770
who would think I
would still bear a child?

42
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:33,244
But Alex...

43
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:38,137
He didn't know that I was already
carrying his baby when he died.

44
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:44,109
Alexandra.

45
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:47,816
You were given to me by God.

46
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,486
When you grow up,

47
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:55,390
it is only Him
that you will serve.

48
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:59,027
You want your only
child to be a nun?

49
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:46,216
Please look at the camera.

50
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:47,596
Hold it.

51
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:58,652
He's such a beautiful child.

52
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,437
Really took after his godfather,

53
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,924
right, friend?

54
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:05,273
He didn't took
after his godfather,

55
00:08:05,274 --> 00:08:06,948
he looks so much like his mother.

56
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:28,798
You know her?

57
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,693
No.

58
00:08:33,968 --> 00:08:35,615
I'll have the child listed.

59
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:58,714
Sister Alexandra?

60
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:00,598
Yes, Mother?

61
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,421
A telegram came for you
before the evening prayer.

62
00:09:04,547 --> 00:09:06,363
You will go home to San Miguel.

63
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:09,446
Why?

64
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:11,895
Your mother died.

65
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:18,842
Let's pray for her soul.

66
00:09:33,732 --> 00:09:34,736
It's done.

67
00:09:35,194 --> 00:09:36,472
Thank you.

68
00:09:36,848 --> 00:09:38,102
Okay, sister.

69
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:39,613
Thank you.

70
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:40,943
We'll go ahead now.

71
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:42,828
- We're going now.
- Sister, we'll go ahead now.

72
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:44,138
Thank you very much.

73
00:09:44,435 --> 00:09:45,881
Thank you.

74
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:04,977
Mother?

75
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,674
Be careful.

76
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,033
Let's pray the rosary first.

77
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:58,068
In the name of the Father, of
the Son, of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

78
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,213
Dear Sisters,

79
00:11:39,214 --> 00:11:43,269
The bodies of Father Fermin, and
Doctor Reynoso were already found.

80
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:45,802
They were buried
in a shallow grave,

81
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:48,463
in the northern portion
of Mount Banaag.

82
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,636
Let us include in our prayers,

83
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:53,382
the innocent
victims of the rebels.

84
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:54,877
The attainment of peace,

85
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:56,628
and order in our country.

86
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,002
Let us remember,

87
00:11:58,003 --> 00:11:59,382
most especially...

88
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:00,223
Father Fermin.

89
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:01,559
Sister Alexandra?

90
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Sister!

91
00:12:05,103 --> 00:12:07,207
Paging Doctor San till an.

92
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,631
You have a telephone
call on station four.

93
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:13,337
Doctor a San till an.
Telephone call on station four.

94
00:12:13,338 --> 00:12:14,902
Looks like you're so serious,

95
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:16,903
about the patient in room 601.

96
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,513
Is it because she's a nun?

97
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:20,689
Well...

98
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:24,427
It's time for her medications.

99
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:25,748
You want to give her any message?

100
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:28,053
Rose, can I do it myself?

101
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:29,762
Sure.

102
00:12:29,763 --> 00:12:31,287
Doctor Lagman, please proceed to...

103
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:32,288
Ronnie!

104
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:33,242
What's the meaning.

105
00:12:33,243 --> 00:12:34,798
Nothing.

106
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:48,968
How do you feel, Sister?

107
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:50,594
I'm okay.

108
00:13:13,811 --> 00:13:14,827
Thank you.

109
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:24,050
You're from...

110
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:25,371
San Miguel too.

111
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:29,008
It's my hometown too, Sister.

112
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:31,510
I read it from your records.

113
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,157
And...

114
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:35,460
It's a coincidence.

115
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:38,551
We have the same birthday.

116
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:39,909
Excuse me.

117
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:41,900
I'm not finished with my prayer.

118
00:13:41,901 --> 00:13:43,389
We met once.

119
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:45,541
At the cemetery.

120
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:46,699
In San Miguel.

121
00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:49,372
I learned from the
grave keepers that

122
00:13:49,868 --> 00:13:52,068
it was your mother who
you were burying then.

123
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:55,568
It's Mrs. Natalia Avila?

124
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:57,839
Sister?

125
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,284
By the way, I'm Nicholas.

126
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:00,593
Alonso-Lopez.

127
00:14:02,155 --> 00:14:04,124
Your family is well-known there.

128
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:05,933
Famous doctors.

129
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:09,898
Why didn't you become one?

130
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:11,532
Why only a nurse?

131
00:14:15,586 --> 00:14:16,685
Why?

132
00:14:16,686 --> 00:14:18,816
I offered to be the one
to give your medicines.

133
00:14:20,207 --> 00:14:22,721
I took the task from
my friend, the nurse,

134
00:14:22,722 --> 00:14:24,194
who's in duty now.

135
00:14:25,427 --> 00:14:26,705
Sister Alexandra?

136
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,570
After two years,

137
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:30,230
I will become a doctor.

138
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:40,594
Good night.

139
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,696
Hey, Nick, is that for me?

140
00:15:24,697 --> 00:15:25,812
Sorry.

141
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:26,567
Not for you.

142
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:28,161
Don't tell me...

143
00:15:29,036 --> 00:15:30,350
For my friend.

144
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,995
I'm so jealous of her.

145
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:33,502
I want to be a nun too.

146
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:45,528
Sister Alexandra?

147
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,034
Thank you.

148
00:15:51,787 --> 00:15:53,423
Nick, please, don't.

149
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:57,236
Are you going straight
home to Santa Inez?

150
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:00,889
Aren't you afraid of that town?

151
00:16:01,423 --> 00:16:02,921
There are a lot of rebels there.

152
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:05,334
One of our professors,
Doctor Reynoso,

153
00:16:05,335 --> 00:16:06,317
was kidnapped,

154
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:08,052
became a hostage and then...

155
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:09,304
was killed.

156
00:16:09,456 --> 00:16:10,456
Nick?

157
00:16:10,604 --> 00:16:11,698
Thank you.

158
00:16:12,594 --> 00:16:14,034
Thank you for this.

159
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Sister.

160
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:29,703
I'll take those.

161
00:16:31,727 --> 00:16:32,727
Okay.

162
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:34,166
We'll be going now.

163
00:16:57,852 --> 00:17:00,776
Is that the patron
given by Sir Felipe?

164
00:17:00,777 --> 00:17:01,777
Yes.

165
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,354
That image is St. Miguel.

166
00:17:13,355 --> 00:17:16,594
And we call the other
one, is St. Martin.

167
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:35,874
Alright, attorney.

168
00:17:39,313 --> 00:17:41,904
I really love it here in
your hometown, dude.

169
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:44,372
What if...

170
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:45,508
I live here?

171
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:47,982
I'll practice law here.

172
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:49,946
If you want,

173
00:17:50,628 --> 00:17:52,112
you can get me as,

174
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,449
your Legal Adviser.

175
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,172
The retainer's fee...

176
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:04,627
You're not even listening to me.

177
00:18:05,603 --> 00:18:07,997
I've noticed, you're
so preoccupied.

178
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,122
What if you're operating
on my abdomen,

179
00:18:11,328 --> 00:18:13,128
and you'd leave your
instruments inside me.

180
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:16,539
Hey, bro?

181
00:18:19,393 --> 00:18:21,978
I said, you're so preoccupied.

182
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:24,330
Yes.

183
00:18:25,286 --> 00:18:28,104
I don't know what's
happening to me.

184
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:32,569
I'm in love.

185
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:35,032
I'm terribly in love.

186
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,804
What's wrong with that?

187
00:18:37,805 --> 00:18:40,112
Nothing's wrong with that.

188
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:41,163
And that's why,

189
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:43,765
give me your first advice.

190
00:18:46,523 --> 00:18:47,804
I am...

191
00:18:48,238 --> 00:18:49,439
Deeply in love.

192
00:18:51,372 --> 00:18:52,874
With a nun.

193
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:02,012
That's heavy.

194
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:05,985
What will I do?

195
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,510
Tell me.

196
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:08,911
Nick...

197
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:11,033
There are a lot of other
women in the world.

198
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,035
And you chose a nun?

199
00:19:17,026 --> 00:19:17,875
Excuse me.

200
00:19:17,876 --> 00:19:18,550
Nick?

201
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:20,311
Your mom is asking for you.

202
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,630
Okay.

203
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,890
Excuse me.

204
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:43,213
Mom?

205
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Yes, Mom?

206
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:50,468
Nicholas, my son.

207
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:54,453
I want to ask you something.

208
00:19:56,197 --> 00:19:57,241
What is it, Mom?

209
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:02,078
I hope...

210
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,442
Before I die,

211
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:08,596
I'd see even a...

212
00:20:09,271 --> 00:20:10,631
grandchild with you.

213
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,200
Even for just one.

214
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:15,302
Mom, don't talk like that.

215
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:17,905
You're just 66 years old.

216
00:20:18,546 --> 00:20:19,800
You're still strong.

217
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,476
You'd see all of
your grandchildren.

218
00:20:23,991 --> 00:20:26,580
I'm too old to expect.

219
00:20:30,516 --> 00:20:32,298
Tell me the truth, Nicholas.

220
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:35,302
Don't you have any
girlfriend until now?

221
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,816
Nicholas?

222
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:39,547
I just want to become a
full pledged doctor first.

223
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:41,862
It's just another two years.

224
00:20:42,036 --> 00:20:44,216
You haven't really
found anyone yet?

225
00:20:44,695 --> 00:20:46,371
Don't lie to me.

226
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:48,447
I have.

227
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:49,461
Don't worry,

228
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:51,879
when she accepts me,

229
00:20:52,348 --> 00:20:54,295
I'll bring her to you right away.

230
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:57,477
I just want to give
you an advice, my son.

231
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,414
I hope...

232
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:02,930
The woman you'd marry,

233
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,458
is...

234
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:06,489
the one whom you really love.

235
00:21:07,277 --> 00:21:09,449
Even if she's poor,

236
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:12,759
I hope she's religious.

237
00:21:14,138 --> 00:21:15,683
Because for me,

238
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:19,036
she'd become a good wife,

239
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:20,517
if she's religious.

240
00:21:39,695 --> 00:21:41,049
- Good morning, Sister.
- Good morning.

241
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,324
I would like to see
your Mother Superior.

242
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:44,306
Yes, she's inside. I'll call her.

243
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:45,307
Thank you.

244
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,917
Thank you so much for
your donations, doctor.

245
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:52,981
These medicines will
truly help a lot of people.

246
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:54,753
If you want, Mother,

247
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,254
we could be there,
when you give it out.

248
00:21:57,255 --> 00:21:59,909
So we could also give
free clinic at the barrio too.

249
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,420
God Bless you, doctor!

250
00:22:03,635 --> 00:22:04,985
By the way, Mother,

251
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:08,066
the hospital wanted
me to give something,

252
00:22:09,295 --> 00:22:13,138
to a nun here. Some X-ray plates.

253
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:15,641
It's Sister...

254
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:17,543
Sister Alexandra.

255
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:18,928
Avila?

256
00:22:41,515 --> 00:22:42,625
How are you?

257
00:22:42,868 --> 00:22:43,976
I'm fine.

258
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:48,527
Here are your x-ray plates.

259
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:50,631
Nothing to worry about.

260
00:22:50,632 --> 00:22:53,152
Just a mild case of peptic ulcer.

261
00:22:53,323 --> 00:22:56,193
Just avoid eating acidic foods.

262
00:22:58,687 --> 00:22:59,824
Thank you.

263
00:23:01,736 --> 00:23:02,856
Sister?

264
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,216
Alexandra?

265
00:23:05,325 --> 00:23:10,069
I hope you can join us in
giving free clinic to the barrio.

266
00:23:10,877 --> 00:23:12,186
Let's see each other again.

267
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:36,048
Sixty-five.

268
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,830
What's your name?

269
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:50,541
Corazon Sanchez.

270
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,168
Hold this carefully.

271
00:23:54,908 --> 00:23:56,118
Give him some water.

272
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:02,732
You need any help?

273
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,723
Forty-nine.

274
00:24:37,635 --> 00:24:39,055
Okay, raise the beam.

275
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:46,202
I think this is better.

276
00:24:46,203 --> 00:24:47,868
Yes.

277
00:27:55,149 --> 00:27:56,629
Dear Nick,

278
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,838
God has not yet given me the sign

279
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:00,467
I'm asking from Him.

280
00:28:00,847 --> 00:28:03,001
So I cannot make any decisions

281
00:28:03,002 --> 00:28:04,627
regarding the two of us.

282
00:28:05,156 --> 00:28:07,420
The sign will remove all my doubts

283
00:28:07,421 --> 00:28:09,421
and fears and guilt too.

284
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,432
If ever I receive it,

285
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:13,518
this will also confirm,

286
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,912
that should I abandon
the Holy Vocation,

287
00:28:16,282 --> 00:28:18,743
we really are
meant for each other.

288
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:21,488
Have patience and faith too.

289
00:28:21,489 --> 00:28:23,013
Yours, Sandra.

290
00:28:23,014 --> 00:28:24,014
Sandra...

291
00:28:24,387 --> 00:28:25,650
Leave the convent.

292
00:28:26,383 --> 00:28:27,835
It is not your vocation.

293
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:29,979
You are for me.

294
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,150
And I am for you.

295
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:32,555
Nick.

296
00:28:50,471 --> 00:28:52,164
One question, one answer...

297
00:28:52,622 --> 00:28:54,601
Do you love me or not?

298
00:28:56,781 --> 00:28:58,066
- What?
- I love you!

299
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:04,444
I love you, Nick.

300
00:29:09,478 --> 00:29:10,686
Wow!

301
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,724
So, you're not going
to take your vows.

302
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:25,664
You don't need the
dispensation from Rome because,

303
00:29:25,914 --> 00:29:27,825
you're not a fully
pledged nun yet.

304
00:29:29,425 --> 00:29:30,975
Sister Alexandra...

305
00:29:31,077 --> 00:29:32,103
Why?

306
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:35,435
I'm getting married, Mother.

307
00:29:36,148 --> 00:29:38,461
Does that man really love you?

308
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:41,207
I'm sure, Mother.

309
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:42,649
How about you, Alexandra?

310
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:44,577
Do you love him?

311
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:47,798
I love him very much, Mother.

312
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:50,122
May God always guide you, my dear.

313
00:29:52,318 --> 00:29:54,290
Thank you so much to all of you.

314
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,650
I have learned so much here.

315
00:29:59,456 --> 00:30:01,773
And I will never waste any of it.

316
00:30:06,522 --> 00:30:08,188
I'll be going now.

317
00:31:01,404 --> 00:31:02,785
Alexandra?

318
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:04,649
You can ride with us.

319
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:06,683
We'll just be dropping
by the health center

320
00:31:06,684 --> 00:31:08,724
then we'll bring
you to San Miguel.

321
00:31:09,915 --> 00:31:11,682
- Thank you, Mother.
- Let's go.

322
00:31:43,974 --> 00:31:45,228
Good morning to you.

323
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:46,444
What's the meaning of this?

324
00:31:47,336 --> 00:31:48,581
Where are the doctors,

325
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:50,734
who were with you at your
medical mission at the barrio?

326
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:52,744
They're not with us
now. Who are you?

327
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:53,974
I'm Anton.

328
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:56,729
The leader of the
N.P.A. in this province.

329
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:58,394
What do you want from us?

330
00:31:58,395 --> 00:31:59,395
Medicines.

331
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:15,605
Perfect timing.

332
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:18,092
You're coming with us,

333
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:20,093
and help treat our wounded men.

334
00:32:21,795 --> 00:32:22,795
Get down!

335
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:24,702
I only hitched a ride.

336
00:32:25,918 --> 00:32:27,255
You're coming too.

337
00:32:27,256 --> 00:32:28,282
Get down!

338
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:31,304
Get down!

339
00:32:33,564 --> 00:32:34,564
Andoy!

340
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,093
Berting!

341
00:32:36,094 --> 00:32:36,878
Come.

342
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:37,879
The medicines.

343
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:42,131
Bring everything!

344
00:32:46,184 --> 00:32:47,309
Stop!

345
00:33:12,604 --> 00:33:13,896
My condolences.

346
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:15,611
Condolence.

347
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:20,011
Excuse me.

348
00:33:21,673 --> 00:33:22,756
Nick?

349
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:23,946
My condolences.

350
00:33:24,488 --> 00:33:25,488
I'm sorry.

351
00:33:26,346 --> 00:33:27,746
I just knew about it.

352
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,954
Good evening, mayor.

353
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:31,955
Good evening.

354
00:33:33,903 --> 00:33:34,617
Mayor!

355
00:33:34,618 --> 00:33:35,592
Good evening, sir.

356
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:36,865
Mayor is here.

357
00:33:37,211 --> 00:33:38,411
Mayor, good evening,

358
00:33:39,947 --> 00:33:41,470
Nick, condolence.

359
00:33:42,477 --> 00:33:44,941
Ivan, this is Attorney
Leo San till an.

360
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:46,003
How are you, mayor?

361
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:47,004
I'm good.

362
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:49,838
By the way, Nick.

363
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:51,518
This is Natashia.

364
00:33:52,068 --> 00:33:53,487
And her sister, Vanya.

365
00:33:53,828 --> 00:33:55,108
They both grew up in the States.

366
00:33:55,678 --> 00:33:57,092
But we also live here.

367
00:33:57,093 --> 00:33:58,093
Hello.

368
00:33:58,518 --> 00:33:59,693
Condolence.

369
00:34:03,478 --> 00:34:04,955
And this is Leo.

370
00:34:05,408 --> 00:34:06,127
Hi.

371
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,132
How do you do?

372
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:09,695
Nick, you may have
forgotten my brother, Eric.

373
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,472
Hi. Condolence.

374
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:20,681
You know, Nicholas.

375
00:34:21,387 --> 00:34:22,647
Attorney San till an.

376
00:34:24,183 --> 00:34:27,883
Nobody would equal the
beauty of the Quint an a sisters,

377
00:34:28,688 --> 00:34:30,023
here in San Miguel.

378
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:35,078
I'm sorry, Nicholas.

379
00:34:38,468 --> 00:34:39,468
Wait.

380
00:34:42,138 --> 00:34:43,082
Leo?

381
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,540
Do you visit San Miguel often?

382
00:34:45,664 --> 00:34:48,348
Nick always brings me here, mayor.

383
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:49,841
Especially during
the fiesta season.

384
00:34:51,147 --> 00:34:52,441
It's better here in town.

385
00:34:52,598 --> 00:34:53,598
Peaceful.

386
00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:57,716
The problem is at the barrios.

387
00:34:58,337 --> 00:34:59,987
The ones far from here.

388
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,109
Because of the rebels?

389
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,809
The entire P.C. detachment.

390
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,769
Sketchy reports reaching
the station also indicated

391
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,250
that the rebel suffered
heavy casualties.

392
00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:11,629
Hours later,

393
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,844
the same group abducted six nuns,

394
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,494
all from the order of the
Daughters of Virgin Mary.

395
00:35:16,668 --> 00:35:18,719
They were identified as.

396
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,110
Mother Superior Benedict a Reyes,

397
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,059
Sister Felecita Sings on,

398
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,139
Sister Josefina Ocampo,

399
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,875
Sister Teresita Mendoza,

400
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,900
Sister Harlinda Montefalco,

401
00:35:28,901 --> 00:35:31,275
and Sister Alexandra Avila.

402
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:35,460
The nuns were on their way to deliver
medicines to the indigent families...

403
00:35:35,461 --> 00:35:37,751
I do not subscribe
to your ideology!

404
00:35:37,862 --> 00:35:39,306
In this life,

405
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:41,141
there is no perfect organization,

406
00:35:41,142 --> 00:35:42,878
and nobody's perfect!

407
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:46,503
But we can live this
life without the killings.

408
00:35:46,504 --> 00:35:49,363
Don't tell me your
organization is perfect.

409
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:52,617
Your religion.

410
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:54,904
Your group.

411
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:58,320
But our organization
believes in the value of

412
00:35:58,947 --> 00:36:01,416
the life of a person.

413
00:36:01,915 --> 00:36:02,961
You know, Mother...

414
00:36:04,585 --> 00:36:06,431
You shouldn't have become a nun.

415
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:09,734
You could've been

416
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:11,162
a priest.

417
00:36:11,163 --> 00:36:12,937
You're good at giving sermons.

418
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:16,674
Go with them at their
sleeping quarters.

419
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,517
I'm not involved in what
you're arguing about.

420
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,720
I implore you,

421
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,822
Anton.

422
00:36:47,086 --> 00:36:49,649
Anton, I am begging you.

423
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,094
I just got involved.

424
00:36:51,265 --> 00:36:53,361
I'm not one of them anymore.

425
00:36:53,362 --> 00:36:55,209
When you stopped our vehicle,

426
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,867
I just hitched a ride.

427
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,883
I was already going home then.

428
00:36:59,444 --> 00:37:00,885
I was already out.

429
00:37:06,774 --> 00:37:08,844
Anton, I implore you.

430
00:37:08,987 --> 00:37:10,641
Someone's waiting for me.

431
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,857
I don't want to be here!

432
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,998
You will like it here.

433
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,734
What?

434
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,828
Sister, Ivan is here.

435
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:42,419
Ivan!

436
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,664
Natashia! You're so pretty!

437
00:37:44,665 --> 00:37:45,907
And mayor is here too.

438
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,617
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you!

439
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,120
Give me that.

440
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,660
Here.

441
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,390
This is from the both of us.

442
00:37:53,516 --> 00:37:55,669
Why are you late?

443
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,869
I had tons of work
at the city hall.

444
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,394
Attorney Tobias is here too.

445
00:37:59,395 --> 00:38:00,989
- Mayor!
- Friend!

446
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,269
He has done a lot for you.

447
00:38:06,435 --> 00:38:07,929
And he's Attorney Tobias.

448
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,294
Yes, I know him.

449
00:38:09,295 --> 00:38:10,599
Nick!

450
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,950
Hi!

451
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,919
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you!

452
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,200
- Natashia, happy birthday.
- Thank you.

453
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,930
- Sorry, we're late.
- It's okay.

454
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,487
I had to pick him up.

455
00:38:21,488 --> 00:38:22,332
I don't have a car.

456
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:24,379
It's good you made it.

457
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,399
Come on.

458
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,399
Ivan is here.

459
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,424
It's Nick and Attorney.

460
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:30,786
- Ivan.
- Nick!

461
00:38:33,985 --> 00:38:34,985
No, thank you.

462
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:37,503
By the way, Nick.

463
00:38:38,507 --> 00:38:39,785
We're waiting for your reply.

464
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:43,124
You haven't received
the letter yet?

465
00:38:44,317 --> 00:38:46,890
You're going to be the new
Municipal Health Officer.

466
00:38:47,497 --> 00:38:49,177
Congratulations, Nick!

467
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,190
Can I be your first patient?

468
00:38:59,341 --> 00:39:01,161
Salsa!

469
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:06,858
Travolta!

470
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,300
Cha-Cha!

471
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,300
Cha-cha!

472
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,372
So, shall we start dancing?

473
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:18,204
Nick?

474
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,423
Okay, let's start.

475
00:39:22,424 --> 00:39:24,981
Excuse us.

476
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,739
- What?
- Nick. Look at Natashia carefully.

477
00:39:50,515 --> 00:39:51,689
Mayor!

478
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:54,789
You're still a good dancer.

479
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,583
You look good together.

480
00:40:04,281 --> 00:40:05,943
She looks better with Ivan.

481
00:40:06,626 --> 00:40:10,794
- No. They're just very good friends.
- It's just like this.

482
00:40:11,172 --> 00:40:12,562
And...

483
00:40:13,157 --> 00:40:14,864
It's hard to wait for nothing.

484
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,109
Nick?

485
00:40:20,398 --> 00:40:24,945
It's more than a year that
you've wasted waiting for Sandra.

486
00:40:25,596 --> 00:40:26,641
Wow.

487
00:40:27,185 --> 00:40:29,539
Why don't you
accept the possibility

488
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,927
that she may be dead now?

489
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,258
Your life would be a
waste if you'd still love her.

490
00:40:34,483 --> 00:40:35,698
While...

491
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:38,414
Natashia is right there.

492
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:40,012
And...

493
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,946
She likes you.

494
00:40:43,037 --> 00:40:44,677
How can you be sure?

495
00:40:44,936 --> 00:40:46,596
I just know it!

496
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,633
And I know that you know it
too. Don't bother denying it!

497
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,102
Nick?

498
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,370
Believe me.

499
00:40:57,405 --> 00:40:59,682
You look so good together.

500
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:16,542
Sorry!

501
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,382
If you're going to cooperate
with the government,

502
00:41:21,702 --> 00:41:23,505
we could give you amnesty.

503
00:41:23,852 --> 00:41:24,907
Two more, major.

504
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,091
Can you show us where

505
00:41:28,092 --> 00:41:30,366
they buried the five
nuns that was kidnapped

506
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:31,972
by Anton at Santa Ines?

507
00:41:32,247 --> 00:41:33,131
Yes, mayor.

508
00:41:33,132 --> 00:41:34,196
In the jungle.

509
00:41:34,197 --> 00:41:35,642
At the foot of Mount Banaag.

510
00:41:37,122 --> 00:41:38,122
Where?

511
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:41,241
Where?

512
00:41:41,242 --> 00:41:42,257
Where?

513
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:38,947
Why, Nick?

514
00:42:41,154 --> 00:42:42,198
She's dead.

515
00:42:44,852 --> 00:42:45,954
She's gone.

516
00:42:47,558 --> 00:42:48,558
Who?

517
00:42:50,215 --> 00:42:51,827
She's one of them, Ivan.

518
00:42:53,633 --> 00:42:54,672
Your friend?

519
00:43:03,726 --> 00:43:05,201
Let's go down.

520
00:43:05,202 --> 00:43:06,202
Let's go.

521
00:44:28,608 --> 00:44:29,755
Natashia?

522
00:44:35,625 --> 00:44:36,625
Nick?

523
00:44:40,835 --> 00:44:42,367
Who are you thinking about?

524
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:50,635
Who is that woman?

525
00:44:51,197 --> 00:44:52,343
She's dead.

526
00:44:55,864 --> 00:44:57,055
Sometimes,

527
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:00,778
I can remember her.

528
00:45:01,121 --> 00:45:02,313
But...

529
00:45:02,955 --> 00:45:04,690
It's natural, isn't it?

530
00:45:08,294 --> 00:45:09,504
She's the past.

531
00:45:11,771 --> 00:45:13,391
Even her name,

532
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:17,508
her story,

533
00:45:20,916 --> 00:45:26,949
and our relationship.

534
00:45:37,028 --> 00:45:39,426
Why should I be insecure
with someone who's dead?

535
00:45:42,293 --> 00:45:43,333
Natashia?

536
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:48,638
Never ever compete with
someone who's already dead.

537
00:45:51,103 --> 00:45:52,108
Don't worry,

538
00:45:52,873 --> 00:45:54,444
I promise you.

539
00:45:56,683 --> 00:45:58,181
From this day on,

540
00:46:01,075 --> 00:46:02,485
I will forget about her.

541
00:46:11,573 --> 00:46:13,420
When do you want to get married?

542
00:46:25,377 --> 00:46:26,484
Doctor?

543
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:30,301
Doctor?

544
00:46:31,537 --> 00:46:32,537
Doctor?

545
00:46:35,527 --> 00:46:37,326
Doctor, Mayor is downstairs and,

546
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:39,582
wanted to wake you
up for an emergency.

547
00:46:55,825 --> 00:46:58,089
Sorry, Nick. This is urgent.

548
00:46:58,090 --> 00:46:59,973
An encounter happened
at "Mat a as na Kahoy".

549
00:46:59,974 --> 00:47:02,476
Major Relano fought Anton's group.

550
00:47:02,477 --> 00:47:04,499
A woman got wounded
in the crossfire.

551
00:47:04,649 --> 00:47:05,905
And she's critical.

552
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:07,172
Please check her.

553
00:47:07,994 --> 00:47:09,808
She asked for my protection.

554
00:47:10,418 --> 00:47:11,574
Over here, Nick.

555
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:22,486
Help doctor!

556
00:48:01,064 --> 00:48:03,655
How long did the
gunfight last, major?

557
00:48:06,564 --> 00:48:08,393
About three hours.

558
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:11,897
It started at ten o'clock until...

559
00:48:12,217 --> 00:48:13,365
around 1 AM.

560
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:15,430
It's a good thing it
wasn't that critical.

561
00:48:16,064 --> 00:48:17,336
No bones got hit.

562
00:48:17,654 --> 00:48:19,038
But it's better,

563
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:20,439
if she can be
brought to a hospital.

564
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,558
So she can fully recover there.

565
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:23,855
Can we transport her?

566
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:25,573
Yes, it's possible.

567
00:48:26,242 --> 00:48:27,310
Bugarin!

568
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:28,333
Sir?

569
00:48:28,334 --> 00:48:29,708
Call an ambulance right away.

570
00:48:29,709 --> 00:48:30,423
Yes, sir.

571
00:48:30,424 --> 00:48:31,798
I think, Major,

572
00:48:31,799 --> 00:48:33,685
we'd have peace around here now.

573
00:48:34,222 --> 00:48:36,218
Especially now that Anton is dead,

574
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:37,601
and his group is gone.

575
00:48:38,061 --> 00:48:39,701
He gave us a real hard time.

576
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:41,546
He's too slick.

577
00:48:41,897 --> 00:48:42,897
Excuse me.

578
00:48:43,103 --> 00:48:44,716
I'll just check the patient.

579
00:49:19,944 --> 00:49:28,064
<i>♪ While there is still
a heart that loves ♪</i>

580
00:49:29,495 --> 00:49:30,787
Nick?

581
00:49:34,325 --> 00:49:35,722
You're safe now.

582
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,295
Take your time to rest.

583
00:49:40,752 --> 00:49:43,865
Nick, help me.

584
00:49:44,197 --> 00:49:46,295
I don't want to go
back to the jungle.

585
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:47,716
Help me.

586
00:49:48,308 --> 00:49:50,445
Hide me from Anton.

587
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,670
You don't have to
be afraid anymore.

588
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,824
He's dead now.

589
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,412
He was killed in the encounter.

590
00:49:57,413 --> 00:49:59,310
Don't leave me.

591
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,269
Have pity on me.

592
00:50:01,646 --> 00:50:03,146
Help me.

593
00:50:04,269 --> 00:50:06,329
Don't leave me.

594
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:08,748
- Don't leave me.
- Yes.

595
00:50:08,975 --> 00:50:18,459
- Don't leave me.
- <i>♪ There's nothing we can't do ♪</i>

596
00:50:18,812 --> 00:50:26,600
<i>♪ Because our love is sacred ♪</i>

597
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:38,734
<i>♪ A love that is immortal ♪</i>

598
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:13,279
A lot has changed with me, Nick.

599
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:16,088
Anton took me.

600
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:20,016
Even if it was against my will.

601
00:51:21,233 --> 00:51:23,218
I fought him at first.

602
00:51:29,209 --> 00:51:30,842
I'm not a virgin anymore, Nick.

603
00:51:34,994 --> 00:51:37,095
My life was changed in the jungle.

604
00:51:39,258 --> 00:51:40,957
I wasn't a nun anymore.

605
00:51:43,327 --> 00:51:46,686
I forgot everything I
learned at the convent.

606
00:51:49,814 --> 00:51:52,307
If you're at the den of animals,

607
00:51:54,648 --> 00:51:56,172
you become one of them too.

608
00:51:58,418 --> 00:51:59,875
Because you want to live.

609
00:52:02,113 --> 00:52:05,022
When I saw people
getting hit by bullets...

610
00:52:07,943 --> 00:52:10,289
People's brains exploding...

611
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:12,631
Blood everywhere.

612
00:52:16,135 --> 00:52:18,297
I have forgotten about love, Nick.

613
00:52:21,275 --> 00:52:23,016
That's why I forgot about you.

614
00:52:23,878 --> 00:52:24,891
Sandra?

615
00:52:28,204 --> 00:52:30,282
But when I saw your face,

616
00:52:32,294 --> 00:52:33,953
my mind became clear again.

617
00:52:36,172 --> 00:52:38,724
Suddenly, I remembered
that there's still love.

618
00:52:41,989 --> 00:52:42,989
Nick?

619
00:52:43,574 --> 00:52:46,038
Before we got ambushed
and taken to the mountains,

620
00:52:47,448 --> 00:52:49,472
I already left the vocation.

621
00:52:50,528 --> 00:52:53,139
I already made my farewell
with Mother Superior.

622
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:57,042
I was on my way to
our meeting place.

623
00:53:00,516 --> 00:53:01,666
Nick?

624
00:53:02,453 --> 00:53:03,749
Do you still love me?

625
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:11,688
In a few...

626
00:53:12,686 --> 00:53:15,120
In a few days, you can
check out from here.

627
00:53:16,128 --> 00:53:17,444
Are you married now?

628
00:53:25,568 --> 00:53:26,568
Hi, Nick.

629
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:27,891
Hi, Ivan.

630
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,060
Come in.

631
00:53:31,191 --> 00:53:32,811
How's our patient doing?

632
00:53:33,281 --> 00:53:34,195
Sandra?

633
00:53:34,196 --> 00:53:35,310
Thank you.

634
00:53:37,604 --> 00:53:38,422
Why?

635
00:53:38,531 --> 00:53:39,641
Nothing.

636
00:53:44,661 --> 00:53:46,563
Sandra, I have good news for you.

637
00:53:47,441 --> 00:53:48,441
What is it?

638
00:53:52,301 --> 00:53:54,071
The military released
your clearance.

639
00:53:55,518 --> 00:53:56,911
They're convinced that,

640
00:53:57,462 --> 00:53:59,710
you're just a victim,
and not one of them.

641
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,915
Thank you, Mayor.

642
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:07,795
You can call me Ivan.

643
00:54:33,843 --> 00:54:35,297
Good afternoon, doctor.

644
00:54:35,298 --> 00:54:36,251
Where's Sandra?

645
00:54:36,252 --> 00:54:38,363
She's in her room. Come in.

646
00:55:00,608 --> 00:55:01,608
Come in.

647
00:55:03,661 --> 00:55:05,343
The doctor is here.

648
00:55:28,797 --> 00:55:30,561
I'm feeling so much better now.

649
00:55:30,562 --> 00:55:31,680
I've recovered.

650
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:34,039
Why did you come here?

651
00:55:35,164 --> 00:55:36,604
Ivan called me.

652
00:55:37,054 --> 00:55:38,264
He asked me to check you.

653
00:55:38,514 --> 00:55:40,570
One final check up.

654
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:43,533
But even if he didn't ask me to,

655
00:55:43,534 --> 00:55:44,882
I'd still come and see you.

656
00:55:51,324 --> 00:55:52,338
Sandra?

657
00:55:52,548 --> 00:55:53,588
Leave now.

658
00:55:53,944 --> 00:55:55,760
We don't have
anything to talk about.

659
00:55:57,555 --> 00:55:58,896
Why did you come here?

660
00:55:59,948 --> 00:56:01,643
And where would I go?

661
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,203
I'm alone, Nick.

662
00:56:06,744 --> 00:56:08,973
I can't go back to
the convent anymore.

663
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,108
Because once you get out of there,

664
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:12,109
that's it.

665
00:56:12,304 --> 00:56:14,212
Once you turn your
back on that kind of life,

666
00:56:15,603 --> 00:56:16,363
it ends there.

667
00:56:16,364 --> 00:56:17,364
Sandra?

668
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:20,388
I'll take you far away from here.

669
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:22,078
Nick?

670
00:56:23,136 --> 00:56:23,916
Anywhere.

671
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:25,182
In another province.

672
00:56:25,866 --> 00:56:27,217
In Manila. Up North.

673
00:56:28,276 --> 00:56:29,936
As long as it's far
from San Miguel.

674
00:56:30,206 --> 00:56:31,810
What would happen to me?

675
00:56:32,746 --> 00:56:34,391
What would I do with my life?

676
00:56:36,946 --> 00:56:39,583
If you're going to marry
me, why go far away?

677
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:43,332
Sandra?

678
00:56:44,616 --> 00:56:45,869
We'll live together.

679
00:56:50,829 --> 00:56:51,875
Not married?

680
00:56:58,276 --> 00:56:59,983
You're a bastard, Nick.

681
00:57:07,263 --> 00:57:08,715
You have changed.

682
00:57:11,556 --> 00:57:12,556
You're right.

683
00:57:13,276 --> 00:57:14,905
Two years is a long time.

684
00:57:16,536 --> 00:57:18,090
But Sandra, I still love you.

685
00:57:18,091 --> 00:57:19,227
No, Nick!

686
00:57:21,406 --> 00:57:22,506
You don't love me.

687
00:57:24,886 --> 00:57:26,610
Because if you really love me,

688
00:57:29,036 --> 00:57:30,626
you'd never make me your mistress.

689
00:57:31,436 --> 00:57:33,016
If you really love me,

690
00:57:33,956 --> 00:57:36,453
you would leave the woman
you promised to marry.

691
00:57:36,811 --> 00:57:37,755
You know about.

692
00:57:37,756 --> 00:57:38,986
Yes, I know everything!

693
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:42,165
Ivan and Eric told me

694
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,094
everything about you and Natashia.

695
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,071
If you really love me,

696
00:57:46,361 --> 00:57:48,395
you can leave that woman.

697
00:57:48,396 --> 00:57:50,397
It would be chaos, Sandra.

698
00:57:51,023 --> 00:57:52,687
And yet we can...

699
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,624
just live together in secret

700
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:56,513
and nobody has to know.

701
00:57:58,369 --> 00:57:59,469
Leave now.

702
00:58:01,546 --> 00:58:02,617
Sandra!

703
00:58:07,787 --> 00:58:08,787
Nick!

704
00:58:09,703 --> 00:58:10,773
Nick!

705
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,000
I know the reason why
you don't want to marry me.

706
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,806
You can't accept that
I had someone else.

707
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:26,210
That I'm not the Alexandra,
whom you knew then.

708
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,848
It's you who changed, Nick.

709
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:32,750
Not me.

710
00:58:34,916 --> 00:58:36,787
You really don't love me at all.

711
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:42,627
Natashia is pregnant.

712
00:59:30,803 --> 00:59:32,413
Congratulations, Nick!

713
00:59:32,758 --> 00:59:34,208
- Ma'am!
- Thank you!

714
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:36,723
Best wishes.

715
00:59:36,724 --> 00:59:37,957
Thank you!

716
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:44,602
Nick? Congratulations.

717
00:59:45,704 --> 00:59:46,738
Best wishes!

718
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:48,049
Congratulations.

719
00:59:48,458 --> 00:59:49,992
Natashia! Best wishes.

720
00:59:49,993 --> 00:59:50,932
Congratulations.

721
00:59:50,933 --> 00:59:52,312
Best wishes.

722
00:59:52,313 --> 00:59:53,257
Thank you!

723
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:54,324
Best wishes.

724
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:56,376
Thank you.

725
00:59:58,757 --> 01:00:00,672
Sandra and I have plans too.

726
01:00:01,851 --> 01:00:03,980
- We'll be getting married soon.
- Really?

727
01:00:04,524 --> 01:00:05,708
Congratulations!

728
01:00:05,709 --> 01:00:07,163
Well, it's about time, Ivan.

729
01:00:07,164 --> 01:00:09,774
So that San Miguel
would have a First Lady.

730
01:00:15,748 --> 01:00:16,866
Mayor.

731
01:00:16,867 --> 01:00:19,680
- Congratulations!
- Thank you.

732
01:00:19,681 --> 01:00:20,505
Thank you.

733
01:00:20,506 --> 01:00:22,470
Mayor, I thought
you'd never get married.

734
01:00:22,471 --> 01:00:23,350
Oh, my!

735
01:00:23,351 --> 01:00:24,826
Mister Crispin!

736
01:00:27,984 --> 01:00:29,204
- Thank you.
- Come in.

737
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:30,975
Ivan.

738
01:00:30,976 --> 01:00:31,656
Thank you.

739
01:00:31,657 --> 01:00:33,325
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

740
01:00:33,326 --> 01:00:35,045
Congratulations.

741
01:00:35,046 --> 01:00:35,850
Congratulations, mayor.

742
01:00:35,851 --> 01:00:36,900
Thank you, Leo.

743
01:00:36,901 --> 01:00:37,969
Mayor?

744
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:42,245
It's all over that you're running
again in the next elections.

745
01:00:42,582 --> 01:00:43,909
Probably.

746
01:00:44,086 --> 01:00:45,756
- But not yet sure.
- Who's there?

747
01:00:46,077 --> 01:00:47,077
Well...

748
01:00:47,301 --> 01:00:48,695
- Good luck!
- Hey, Auntie!

749
01:00:48,696 --> 01:00:50,695
Nick, I'm going to
Aunt Amparo, okay?

750
01:00:51,506 --> 01:00:53,436
- Wow.
- Thank you very much.

751
01:00:53,777 --> 01:00:55,047
It's already seven months.

752
01:00:55,048 --> 01:00:57,254
- Really?
- It's so fast. Here's Nick.

753
01:00:58,646 --> 01:01:00,256
You may have a boy.

754
01:01:00,965 --> 01:01:02,049
Thank you, Leo.

755
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:03,110
- Friend!
- Hey!

756
01:01:03,371 --> 01:01:04,450
How are you?

757
01:01:04,451 --> 01:01:05,585
- Thank you.
- I'm good.

758
01:01:05,586 --> 01:01:06,850
- Hello?
- Are they there?

759
01:01:06,851 --> 01:01:08,625
- They're inside.
- They're waiting for you.

760
01:01:08,626 --> 01:01:10,376
Come on, and let's see them.

761
01:01:11,385 --> 01:01:12,634
To whom did that come from?

762
01:01:13,907 --> 01:01:15,660
From Nick and Natashia.

763
01:03:27,896 --> 01:03:28,896
I'm sorry.

764
01:03:31,329 --> 01:03:33,078
It's alright, Ivan.

765
01:03:34,051 --> 01:03:35,922
You may be just tired.

766
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,281
We had a lot of visitors earlier.

767
01:04:00,258 --> 01:04:01,702
How's Manila?

768
01:04:01,703 --> 01:04:03,767
- This one too.
- It's too rowdy there.

769
01:04:03,768 --> 01:04:06,469
Nothing has changed
from 1972 to 1985.

770
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:08,695
I mean, if it's just
about the politics.

771
01:04:09,093 --> 01:04:11,017
Or are you joining
the demonstrations?

772
01:04:11,018 --> 01:04:13,532
And the rallies, then
neglect your studies.

773
01:04:13,533 --> 01:04:14,533
Of course not!

774
01:04:14,757 --> 01:04:16,566
So, how's the...

775
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:18,063
first lady of San Miguel?

776
01:04:19,437 --> 01:04:21,406
Ma'am Alexandra.

777
01:04:21,753 --> 01:04:22,943
I pity that woman.

778
01:04:23,252 --> 01:04:25,882
Up to now accepting her by
Ivan's relatives is a struggle.

779
01:04:26,245 --> 01:04:28,259
The whole Recelis
clan spits at her.

780
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:31,502
Well, that would happen since Eric's
clan is from genuine aristocrats.

781
01:04:31,503 --> 01:04:33,517
Of course, they don't
want fakes like Sandra.

782
01:04:33,518 --> 01:04:34,792
Not only that, Vanya.

783
01:04:34,793 --> 01:04:36,942
Imagine, up to now,
she's not pregnant.

784
01:04:36,943 --> 01:04:39,333
Unlike me, I'm on my
second at my fifth month.

785
01:04:39,803 --> 01:04:42,027
If I didn't have a
miscarriage then,

786
01:04:42,028 --> 01:04:43,625
Ivan and Sandra
would die of jealousy.

787
01:04:45,566 --> 01:04:47,234
Why don't we eat outside?

788
01:04:47,235 --> 01:04:49,235
Let's drop by at Nick's
office at the city hall.

789
01:04:49,455 --> 01:04:51,409
Just give me ten
minutes to take a shower.

790
01:04:51,410 --> 01:04:52,410
Okay.

791
01:04:53,655 --> 01:04:55,735
Just watch some movies
with the betamax, if you want.

792
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:57,457
Let me see the tapes.

793
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,751
Vanya!

794
01:05:16,866 --> 01:05:18,094
Vanya!

795
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:21,341
Sister?

796
01:05:21,342 --> 01:05:22,345
Vanya!

797
01:05:22,346 --> 01:05:23,436
Vanya!

798
01:05:35,418 --> 01:05:36,418
Don't cry.

799
01:05:36,678 --> 01:05:38,001
It's the second, Nick.

800
01:05:42,357 --> 01:05:45,378
I don't understand
why they don't survive.

801
01:05:47,822 --> 01:05:49,912
What if we don't have
a child anymore, Nick?

802
01:05:50,096 --> 01:05:51,652
You don't have any problem.

803
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:55,352
You had the miscarriage
due to an accident.

804
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:57,497
So, Natashia, next time,

805
01:05:58,362 --> 01:06:00,304
you should be more careful.

806
01:06:15,816 --> 01:06:17,725
The D.T.I would take care of

807
01:06:17,726 --> 01:06:19,460
the honorarium for the

808
01:06:19,461 --> 01:06:21,070
requisition of

809
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:23,461
resource persons, trainors,

810
01:06:23,795 --> 01:06:25,485
and workshops here in our town.

811
01:06:26,126 --> 01:06:29,433
A lot of our fellowmen would
benefit from your plans, mayor.

812
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:31,092
And I am confident

813
01:06:31,494 --> 01:06:34,497
that would give
you a lot of votes,

814
01:06:34,746 --> 01:06:36,315
in the upcoming elections.

815
01:06:36,316 --> 01:06:37,556
Just the right time, mayor.

816
01:06:38,086 --> 01:06:40,126
The political party supports you,

817
01:06:40,233 --> 01:06:42,364
to be a candidate for governor.

818
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:45,552
Excuse me.

819
01:06:46,171 --> 01:06:47,591
Have some coffee.

820
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:49,583
There's orange there too.

821
01:06:49,584 --> 01:06:51,179
Good day.

822
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:54,810
This is for you.

823
01:06:55,648 --> 01:06:56,646
Thank you.

824
01:06:56,647 --> 01:06:58,067
By the way, mayor.

825
01:06:58,243 --> 01:06:59,868
Later this three in the afternoon,

826
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:02,019
a delegation will come to you.

827
01:07:02,196 --> 01:07:06,001
They're from San Vicente
and from San Cristobal.

828
01:07:07,352 --> 01:07:08,441
How many are they?

829
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:10,144
Around thirty.

830
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:14,482
It would be best if you
have them prepare dinner.

831
01:07:15,481 --> 01:07:16,641
I'll take care of it.

832
01:07:18,195 --> 01:07:19,253
Okay.

833
01:07:19,373 --> 01:07:20,906
I'll go ahead.

834
01:07:25,576 --> 01:07:26,594
I'll see you.

835
01:07:46,718 --> 01:07:47,894
How are you?

836
01:07:49,287 --> 01:07:50,287
Fine.

837
01:07:54,326 --> 01:07:55,326
And you?

838
01:07:56,326 --> 01:07:57,326
Good.

839
01:07:57,563 --> 01:07:59,419
How's Natashia?

840
01:08:00,028 --> 01:08:01,064
Good.

841
01:08:09,472 --> 01:08:10,227
Is...

842
01:08:10,228 --> 01:08:12,247
Is Ivan in his office already?

843
01:08:13,088 --> 01:08:14,098
He has...

844
01:08:14,209 --> 01:08:15,939
visitors actually.

845
01:08:36,316 --> 01:08:37,612
I need you.

846
01:08:43,076 --> 01:08:44,276
Let's meet.

847
01:08:47,222 --> 01:08:49,336
I would really
love to talk to you.

848
01:08:51,856 --> 01:08:53,136
In another place.

849
01:10:52,347 --> 01:10:55,119
Are you happy with Ivan?

850
01:11:03,852 --> 01:11:05,833
If I am, I won't be here.

851
01:11:11,428 --> 01:11:12,658
You know, Nick.

852
01:11:14,877 --> 01:11:17,714
We've been married
for more than two years,

853
01:11:20,638 --> 01:11:22,584
but nothing is still happening.

854
01:11:27,626 --> 01:11:29,616
He has a problem, Nick.

855
01:11:31,728 --> 01:11:32,957
What problem?

856
01:11:45,793 --> 01:11:47,050
He's impotent.

857
01:11:56,834 --> 01:11:57,834
You?

858
01:11:59,474 --> 01:12:00,825
You and Natashia...

859
01:12:03,342 --> 01:12:04,793
Are you happy?

860
01:12:11,568 --> 01:12:12,874
I was forced.

861
01:12:15,618 --> 01:12:17,145
Since I got her pregnant.

862
01:12:22,448 --> 01:12:24,285
Sandra, when I lost you,

863
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:28,256
my world was in chaos.

864
01:12:31,084 --> 01:12:32,460
There were times when,

865
01:12:35,328 --> 01:12:38,118
I didn't know what
was right or wrong.

866
01:12:43,948 --> 01:12:46,441
I was so lonely then, Sandra.

867
01:12:49,388 --> 01:12:50,578
And she was there.

868
01:12:57,242 --> 01:12:59,220
But I always had that feeling

869
01:13:01,436 --> 01:13:04,053
that you and I will
end up together.

870
01:13:14,204 --> 01:13:15,576
I love you, Nick.

871
01:13:17,757 --> 01:13:19,293
I love you, too.

872
01:13:58,308 --> 01:14:02,016
I wasn't able to go home right away
after shopping since I felt weak.

873
01:14:02,818 --> 01:14:04,358
Too tired, I guess.

874
01:14:05,532 --> 01:14:06,532
Sweetheart?

875
01:14:08,218 --> 01:14:09,857
That's all for you.
Do you like it?

876
01:14:12,808 --> 01:14:14,562
Eric, is that size okay for you?

877
01:14:16,378 --> 01:14:17,837
The size is perfect!

878
01:14:17,838 --> 01:14:19,822
That's a different
brand, but it's the latest.

879
01:14:19,823 --> 01:14:20,823
Thank you.

880
01:14:23,831 --> 01:14:24,800
Ivan?

881
01:14:24,801 --> 01:14:26,043
Don't worry.

882
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:28,925
The money I used for this,

883
01:14:29,345 --> 01:14:31,829
is from my savings and allowances,

884
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:34,134
that you gave me for two years.

885
01:14:34,468 --> 01:14:36,104
This is not government money.

886
01:14:36,424 --> 01:14:37,696
By the way,

887
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:41,479
I had caps and
jackets custom made.

888
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:44,368
We'll wear it at the
campaign for the elections.

889
01:14:47,751 --> 01:14:49,554
And this came from my money too.

890
01:14:50,615 --> 01:14:52,249
So, when you're already governor,

891
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:54,705
you'd refund
everything I spent today.

892
01:14:57,119 --> 01:14:58,123
Just kidding.

893
01:15:09,209 --> 01:15:11,513
All you thought about was
me when you were in Manila.

894
01:15:11,514 --> 01:15:13,514
That's what you think, brother.

895
01:15:15,909 --> 01:15:17,176
What do you mean?

896
01:15:18,789 --> 01:15:20,313
I was also part of it.

897
01:15:20,704 --> 01:15:21,658
Just look at this.

898
01:15:21,659 --> 01:15:23,516
Sandra still remembered me.

899
01:15:24,049 --> 01:15:25,387
She bought a lot.

900
01:15:25,659 --> 01:15:26,719
Thank you.

901
01:15:27,704 --> 01:15:28,838
Rest now,

902
01:15:28,839 --> 01:15:30,154
before we have dinner.

903
01:15:37,961 --> 01:15:38,965
Ivan?

904
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:42,735
I wanted to ask your permission.

905
01:15:43,689 --> 01:15:45,779
Will you allow me again?

906
01:15:46,249 --> 01:15:49,909
I'm sorry but I don't want you
to think that I love doing this.

907
01:15:51,606 --> 01:15:52,646
But you know...

908
01:15:53,113 --> 01:15:54,693
I wanted to have a retreat.

909
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:56,749
Spiritual retreat, Ivan.

910
01:15:58,089 --> 01:16:00,363
I just don't know which convent

911
01:16:00,364 --> 01:16:02,919
which is at Santa
Inez, or Santa Rosario.

912
01:16:04,262 --> 01:16:05,700
Or in Manila?

913
01:16:07,113 --> 01:16:08,177
You know.

914
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:11,289
I need this retreat very badly.

915
01:16:11,789 --> 01:16:12,733
And it's perfect timing.

916
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,734
When I get back,
your campaign starts.

917
01:16:16,633 --> 01:16:17,633
Just a minute.

918
01:16:17,789 --> 01:16:19,705
Why are you being
so formal about it?

919
01:16:21,138 --> 01:16:22,188
Well...

920
01:16:22,189 --> 01:16:25,444
I'm talking to the next
governor of this province.

921
01:16:30,592 --> 01:16:31,912
When are you leaving then?

922
01:16:32,647 --> 01:16:34,187
Last Friday of this month.

923
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:35,784
How many days will you be gone?

924
01:16:36,087 --> 01:16:37,087
Four.

925
01:16:37,728 --> 01:16:39,466
Five days, the most.

926
01:16:40,622 --> 01:16:42,346
Where is that conference?

927
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:43,259
Bacolod.

928
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:44,417
Can I come?

929
01:16:45,658 --> 01:16:46,700
No.

930
01:16:46,701 --> 01:16:47,701
No.

931
01:16:49,797 --> 01:16:51,258
Your diastolic is high.

932
01:16:54,044 --> 01:16:55,330
Even if you'd go to Manila,

933
01:16:55,331 --> 01:16:58,111
I wouldn't let you come.

934
01:16:58,599 --> 01:17:00,140
More so in the province.

935
01:17:00,919 --> 01:17:02,434
Bacolod is very far.

936
01:17:04,385 --> 01:17:05,625
And...

937
01:17:07,065 --> 01:17:08,997
You're almost due to give birth.

938
01:17:09,606 --> 01:17:10,955
This is your third.

939
01:17:11,898 --> 01:17:13,412
I need this baby.

940
01:17:15,447 --> 01:17:16,448
Yes, doc.

941
01:17:20,518 --> 01:17:23,889
You're having frequent
conferences recently.

942
01:17:24,675 --> 01:17:26,305
And most of it, is out of town.

943
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:30,159
I can't do anything around
the house. I'm so bored already.

944
01:17:30,945 --> 01:17:32,925
And we don't talk much now, Nick.

945
01:17:33,085 --> 01:17:34,389
When you're here in San Miguel,

946
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:35,723
you're always busy.

947
01:17:36,375 --> 01:17:39,868
If you're not at the provincial hospital,
you're at the clinic in city hall.

948
01:17:40,945 --> 01:17:42,579
I miss you so much
already, you know.

949
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:43,684
You're so corny.

950
01:17:43,685 --> 01:17:46,875
Well, cope with that since I've
watched all the drama with the betamax.

951
01:17:48,446 --> 01:17:49,706
Ouch.

952
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:56,196
Our baby really kicks hard.

953
01:17:56,725 --> 01:17:57,955
Maybe it's a boy.

954
01:17:58,777 --> 01:18:00,411
It doesn't matter
if it's a boy or girl,

955
01:18:00,412 --> 01:18:01,660
as long as it's alive.

956
01:18:02,517 --> 01:18:05,105
What if I suddenly give
birth and you're in Bacolod?

957
01:18:05,438 --> 01:18:07,137
Your due date is next month.

958
01:18:07,787 --> 01:18:08,791
You know better than I do.

959
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:09,935
But I'm the doctor here.

960
01:19:25,453 --> 01:19:26,893
I love you, Nick.

961
01:19:32,754 --> 01:19:33,924
Alexandra.

962
01:20:01,893 --> 01:20:04,426
You should wear bikini.

963
01:20:06,684 --> 01:20:08,808
Dude, wear bikini, okay?

964
01:20:09,377 --> 01:20:11,840
We should go back
here, it's beautiful.

965
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,544
Mike? I thought it was Jake?

966
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:17,997
Let's swim before we eat, okay?

967
01:20:19,019 --> 01:20:20,673
Let's swim first!

968
01:20:20,674 --> 01:20:21,828
You're going to eat again?

969
01:20:21,829 --> 01:20:23,063
You're such a glutton!

970
01:20:23,064 --> 01:20:24,370
You're a show off!

971
01:20:24,371 --> 01:20:25,914
You always pick on me.

972
01:20:25,915 --> 01:20:27,041
Nick!

973
01:20:34,846 --> 01:20:36,050
What are you doing here?

974
01:20:36,051 --> 01:20:37,726
But brother, what
are you doing here?

975
01:20:37,929 --> 01:20:39,027
Me?

976
01:20:39,028 --> 01:20:40,202
I'm just relaxing,

977
01:20:40,203 --> 01:20:41,722
before I go home to San Miguel.

978
01:20:42,184 --> 01:20:44,633
Actually, I'm heading
home in a while.

979
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,818
Why aren't you eating your
breakfast with Sister yet?

980
01:20:47,819 --> 01:20:49,312
It's already late!

981
01:20:50,778 --> 01:20:51,778
Who is that.

982
01:20:53,062 --> 01:20:55,221
Them? They're my friends
from the boarding house.

983
01:20:55,532 --> 01:20:58,686
The cutest among them
is my newest boyfriend.

984
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,531
It's really great that
you're here with Sister,

985
01:21:00,532 --> 01:21:01,986
I'd like you to meet him.

986
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:02,866
Okay?

987
01:21:02,867 --> 01:21:03,821
And you know,

988
01:21:03,822 --> 01:21:06,536
he's smart! Much nicer than Eric.

989
01:21:06,852 --> 01:21:08,446
And his sense of humor,

990
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:10,301
is much like yours!

991
01:21:10,302 --> 01:21:11,302
You'd be laughing.

992
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:15,423
Ma'am Recelis?

993
01:21:25,272 --> 01:21:27,486
Shit! You're together?

994
01:21:27,487 --> 01:21:28,497
Shit!

995
01:21:30,884 --> 01:21:33,158
Let's go home! Hurry!

996
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:51,130
Now we have a problem.

997
01:21:54,892 --> 01:21:56,511
You bastard!

998
01:21:56,512 --> 01:21:57,941
You cheater!

999
01:21:57,942 --> 01:22:00,041
You've been fooling
me all this time!

1000
01:22:00,042 --> 01:22:02,066
That damn Alexandra!

1001
01:22:02,067 --> 01:22:04,067
Screw you two!

1002
01:22:05,022 --> 01:22:07,455
Damn you!

1003
01:22:07,608 --> 01:22:09,142
Damn you!

1004
01:22:10,788 --> 01:22:12,220
Natashia?

1005
01:22:12,705 --> 01:22:14,149
What you're doing,

1006
01:22:14,150 --> 01:22:16,044
is really bad for your condition.

1007
01:22:16,045 --> 01:22:16,862
You must be careful with our.

1008
01:22:16,863 --> 01:22:17,959
You bastard!

1009
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,315
You don't even deserve
to be the father of my child!

1010
01:22:20,316 --> 01:22:21,930
What else do you want to happen?

1011
01:22:21,931 --> 01:22:23,764
- A lot has happened.
- Don't deny it!

1012
01:22:23,765 --> 01:22:26,528
Don't try and make
my sister a big liar!

1013
01:22:26,794 --> 01:22:28,778
I will let the whole of
San Miguel know that

1014
01:22:28,779 --> 01:22:30,658
the mayor's wife and my husband.

1015
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:31,783
Let's avoid the scandal!

1016
01:22:31,784 --> 01:22:33,583
And now you're afraid
of your own ghost?

1017
01:22:34,457 --> 01:22:35,501
Eric?

1018
01:22:35,502 --> 01:22:38,052
Him and your damn sister-in-law!

1019
01:22:38,155 --> 01:22:39,755
And my husband!

1020
01:22:51,455 --> 01:22:52,521
Eric!

1021
01:22:52,522 --> 01:22:53,522
Eric!

1022
01:22:54,225 --> 01:22:55,235
Eric!

1023
01:23:10,504 --> 01:23:11,724
That's enough! That's enough!

1024
01:23:12,353 --> 01:23:14,253
She has been doing
that to you for some time.

1025
01:23:14,619 --> 01:23:16,339
And you'd just let her?

1026
01:23:16,616 --> 01:23:18,796
And your best friend betrayed you.

1027
01:23:18,931 --> 01:23:20,419
You didn't see anything,

1028
01:23:20,959 --> 01:23:22,189
you never heard anything,

1029
01:23:22,306 --> 01:23:23,529
and you don't know anything.

1030
01:23:26,453 --> 01:23:28,133
Brother, I can't understand you.

1031
01:23:28,833 --> 01:23:30,236
Because you're stupid.

1032
01:23:30,513 --> 01:23:31,737
What do you want me to do?

1033
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:33,631
Kill Nick?

1034
01:23:34,066 --> 01:23:35,552
Kill Sandra?

1035
01:23:35,553 --> 01:23:37,343
- Yes!
- And then what?

1036
01:23:37,944 --> 01:23:39,069
I would go to jail.

1037
01:23:39,643 --> 01:23:41,213
Our name would be ruined.

1038
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,016
My dreams would be destroyed.

1039
01:23:46,334 --> 01:23:47,340
Eric?

1040
01:23:47,975 --> 01:23:49,215
The person in front of you now,

1041
01:23:49,962 --> 01:23:52,755
someday would become the
president of the Philippines.

1042
01:23:55,638 --> 01:23:56,638
Brother?

1043
01:23:57,575 --> 01:23:58,776
You're crazy!

1044
01:24:02,802 --> 01:24:03,876
Are you going to eat now, ma'am?

1045
01:24:03,877 --> 01:24:05,121
I'll wait for Ivan.

1046
01:24:05,449 --> 01:24:06,760
Hi, handsome.

1047
01:24:07,777 --> 01:24:09,121
I heard that,

1048
01:24:09,122 --> 01:24:11,236
you've been working
hard preparing for

1049
01:24:11,237 --> 01:24:13,161
the campaign of your brother Ivan.

1050
01:24:18,151 --> 01:24:19,735
Eric, you're not done eating.

1051
01:24:19,736 --> 01:24:21,521
I suddenly felt ill.

1052
01:24:22,462 --> 01:24:24,012
I feel like I'm about to vomit.

1053
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,341
Are you sick?

1054
01:24:25,934 --> 01:24:26,934
Bitch!

1055
01:24:40,772 --> 01:24:41,772
Ma'am?

1056
01:24:42,564 --> 01:24:44,402
Mrs. Lopez is here.

1057
01:24:46,168 --> 01:24:47,238
Let her in.

1058
01:24:48,027 --> 01:24:49,941
Please come in, Mrs. Lopez.

1059
01:24:54,282 --> 01:24:55,796
Natashia? It's good to see you.

1060
01:24:55,797 --> 01:24:56,741
You're almost due.

1061
01:24:56,742 --> 01:24:57,596
Come and have a seat.

1062
01:24:57,597 --> 01:24:58,887
You're so insensitive.

1063
01:24:59,777 --> 01:25:01,421
The whole province
is talking about you,

1064
01:25:01,422 --> 01:25:02,987
and yet, you show
yourself in public.

1065
01:25:03,977 --> 01:25:05,241
If you still have
enough dignity left,

1066
01:25:05,242 --> 01:25:06,596
why don't you just
leave this town!

1067
01:25:06,597 --> 01:25:07,877
You stole my husband!

1068
01:25:11,777 --> 01:25:12,824
Leave now.

1069
01:25:12,825 --> 01:25:14,095
You should leave!

1070
01:25:14,615 --> 01:25:16,162
You should be
embarrassed with this family!

1071
01:25:16,163 --> 01:25:18,489
Don't tell me what I have to do.

1072
01:25:19,295 --> 01:25:20,712
You have nothing
to do with my life.

1073
01:25:20,713 --> 01:25:22,323
I do. And it's big.

1074
01:25:22,787 --> 01:25:23,977
You stole Nick.

1075
01:25:24,682 --> 01:25:26,056
The man you stole

1076
01:25:26,057 --> 01:25:27,417
just so happened to be my husband.

1077
01:25:27,728 --> 01:25:29,718
Aren't you satisfied with one man?

1078
01:25:29,995 --> 01:25:31,248
Who else, Alexandra?

1079
01:25:31,853 --> 01:25:36,323
Who else do you bed in this town?

1080
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:37,800
Are you leaving or not?

1081
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:40,746
Or do you want me
to call the police?

1082
01:25:40,747 --> 01:25:42,100
You're a nymphomaniac!

1083
01:25:42,101 --> 01:25:43,291
You don't have evidence.

1084
01:25:43,455 --> 01:25:46,417
My sister saw you
and Vanya never lies.

1085
01:25:47,908 --> 01:25:50,577
Tell me every insult you want,

1086
01:25:52,039 --> 01:25:54,243
but I will never stoop
down to your level.

1087
01:25:54,244 --> 01:25:55,354
Natashia?

1088
01:25:55,828 --> 01:25:57,974
You're educated and all but,

1089
01:25:57,975 --> 01:25:59,155
you're so disrespectful.

1090
01:26:00,404 --> 01:26:02,554
All you say are filth.

1091
01:26:02,714 --> 01:26:03,807
I pity you.

1092
01:26:04,091 --> 01:26:05,589
Since you have done everything,

1093
01:26:06,594 --> 01:26:08,603
and yet, your
husband can't take you.

1094
01:26:08,604 --> 01:26:09,797
You're really a bitch!

1095
01:26:09,798 --> 01:26:10,798
Bitch?

1096
01:26:11,686 --> 01:26:13,809
Why aren't you
married to Nick yet?

1097
01:26:15,122 --> 01:26:15,946
You're just pregnant.

1098
01:26:15,947 --> 01:26:17,440
You bitch!

1099
01:26:17,441 --> 01:26:18,951
Natashia, please?

1100
01:26:19,232 --> 01:26:20,092
Ivan!

1101
01:26:20,093 --> 01:26:21,517
Open your eyes!

1102
01:26:21,914 --> 01:26:24,019
Please leave.

1103
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:25,345
What kind of man are you?

1104
01:26:26,061 --> 01:26:28,332
You're tolerating
what this woman did?

1105
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,029
She's disgusting!

1106
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:32,048
She should be thrown
out of this house, Ivan!

1107
01:26:34,236 --> 01:26:35,686
Natashia, you're wrong.

1108
01:26:40,977 --> 01:26:42,359
My wife is clean.

1109
01:26:43,437 --> 01:26:47,021
It's just one of the black
propagandas of my enemies in politics.

1110
01:26:47,022 --> 01:26:48,263
They're trying to ruin me.

1111
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:51,064
And you're being carried away by

1112
01:26:51,065 --> 01:26:53,641
news made by rumor
mongers here in San Miguel.

1113
01:26:53,949 --> 01:26:55,189
And most of all,

1114
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:57,360
you're being like that because,

1115
01:26:58,590 --> 01:26:59,870
you're so jealous.

1116
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:03,379
But you don't even
have any evidence.

1117
01:27:06,141 --> 01:27:07,194
Alright.

1118
01:27:07,195 --> 01:27:08,683
Give me proof.

1119
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:11,220
And I will believe
everything you say,

1120
01:27:11,221 --> 01:27:12,561
against my beloved wife.

1121
01:27:12,905 --> 01:27:15,617
Your wife has betrayed you,
and you choose to be blind?

1122
01:27:15,945 --> 01:27:17,469
You will regret this, Ivan.

1123
01:27:59,396 --> 01:28:00,876
What will I do, bro?

1124
01:28:00,983 --> 01:28:01,983
You know, Nick...

1125
01:28:02,332 --> 01:28:03,512
If I were you,

1126
01:28:04,142 --> 01:28:05,742
I will forget Sandra.

1127
01:28:06,212 --> 01:28:07,640
Not because of Natashia.

1128
01:28:07,992 --> 01:28:09,832
But because of your child.

1129
01:28:10,694 --> 01:28:12,144
Give your child a break.

1130
01:28:12,702 --> 01:28:13,992
Have pity on him.

1131
01:28:14,302 --> 01:28:15,302
Imagine,

1132
01:28:15,427 --> 01:28:17,831
he's not even born yet,
and his life is in shambles.

1133
01:28:17,832 --> 01:28:19,318
Because of another woman.

1134
01:28:25,502 --> 01:28:26,502
Look, Nick.

1135
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:29,243
For the sake of your child,

1136
01:28:29,645 --> 01:28:30,739
forget her.

1137
01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:32,064
It's very obvious.

1138
01:28:32,065 --> 01:28:34,065
You're not meant for each other.

1139
01:28:37,171 --> 01:28:39,221
A good evening to all of you,

1140
01:28:39,222 --> 01:28:41,073
my beloved fellowmen!

1141
01:28:48,035 --> 01:28:49,885
I don't know how to promise,

1142
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:53,270
that's why I want to
go straight to the point.

1143
01:28:53,743 --> 01:28:55,767
I swear to all of you,

1144
01:28:55,768 --> 01:28:57,815
if you will elect me,

1145
01:28:58,230 --> 01:28:59,947
as your governor,

1146
01:29:00,448 --> 01:29:01,968
I will take care of

1147
01:29:02,072 --> 01:29:03,661
our whole province.

1148
01:29:07,986 --> 01:29:11,228
I will watch over the welfare,
of each and every one of you.

1149
01:29:11,767 --> 01:29:13,181
I will monitor

1150
01:29:13,713 --> 01:29:14,891
the peace,

1151
01:29:15,048 --> 01:29:16,138
and order,

1152
01:29:16,459 --> 01:29:17,915
of each barrio,

1153
01:29:17,916 --> 01:29:20,066
and town of our province.

1154
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,079
My beloved fellowmen,

1155
01:29:30,136 --> 01:29:31,520
I will watch over,

1156
01:29:31,521 --> 01:29:32,681
everyone of you!

1157
01:29:33,736 --> 01:29:35,490
You will watch over us?

1158
01:29:35,491 --> 01:29:37,818
You can't even
watch over your wife!

1159
01:29:37,819 --> 01:29:39,282
Watch over your wife!

1160
01:29:52,172 --> 01:29:53,342
My beloved fellowmen,

1161
01:29:55,246 --> 01:29:57,495
let's not give them attention,

1162
01:29:57,496 --> 01:29:59,120
since they're from
the other party and

1163
01:29:59,121 --> 01:30:00,869
they just want to
ruin this campaign.

1164
01:30:04,842 --> 01:30:06,005
What's that?

1165
01:30:06,937 --> 01:30:09,202
Ma'am is leaving.

1166
01:30:18,531 --> 01:30:20,061
You're not leaving.

1167
01:30:20,904 --> 01:30:22,253
I beg of you.

1168
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:24,046
Stay here.

1169
01:30:24,469 --> 01:30:28,018
Let's show all the people that there's
nothing bad happening between us.

1170
01:30:29,483 --> 01:30:31,393
That you're not betraying
me with another man.

1171
01:30:31,849 --> 01:30:33,259
That we love each other.

1172
01:30:34,257 --> 01:30:35,962
Ivan, I'm so ashamed for you.

1173
01:30:37,941 --> 01:30:39,032
I've done you wrong.

1174
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,626
I really don't deserve you.

1175
01:30:42,627 --> 01:30:43,737
Please, I implore you.

1176
01:30:47,028 --> 01:30:48,408
I beg you.

1177
01:30:50,236 --> 01:30:51,611
I'll go down on my knees,

1178
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:53,274
and I will take everything.

1179
01:30:53,275 --> 01:30:54,759
Even if they call me names,

1180
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,660
and whatever, but please, Sandra?

1181
01:30:58,200 --> 01:30:59,690
Please forgive me, Ivan.

1182
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:09,420
Let me leave.

1183
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:11,499
Sandra, you will not leave me.

1184
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:14,653
Set me free, Ivan.

1185
01:31:14,654 --> 01:31:16,325
Sandra. I'm begging you.

1186
01:31:53,645 --> 01:31:54,935
Ivan, don't!

1187
01:31:55,175 --> 01:31:57,223
You will not leave me!

1188
01:31:58,861 --> 01:32:00,587
Sandra, I love you!

1189
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,166
Brother, don't!

1190
01:32:37,557 --> 01:32:38,619
Ma'am?

1191
01:32:38,839 --> 01:32:40,498
- Mayor!
- Ma'am!

1192
01:32:40,499 --> 01:32:42,238
Ma'am!

1193
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:43,393
- Ma'am!
- What happened?

1194
01:32:43,394 --> 01:32:44,348
Hurry!

1195
01:32:44,349 --> 01:32:45,713
Let's take them to the hospital!

1196
01:32:45,714 --> 01:32:46,743
Let's take them!

1197
01:32:46,744 --> 01:32:47,798
Ma'am!

1198
01:32:47,799 --> 01:32:49,729
Ma'am!

1199
01:32:50,769 --> 01:32:51,846
Ma'am!

1200
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:00,038
Where are you going?

1201
01:33:00,779 --> 01:33:02,063
Where are you going?

1202
01:33:02,064 --> 01:33:04,109
Natashia! Stop it!

1203
01:33:04,110 --> 01:33:05,408
Ivan died!

1204
01:33:06,352 --> 01:33:08,394
I'm coming with you! I
want to see my friend!

1205
01:33:08,395 --> 01:33:09,437
Don't!

1206
01:33:09,438 --> 01:33:10,761
In your condition,

1207
01:33:10,762 --> 01:33:12,062
it would be bad for you.

1208
01:33:12,474 --> 01:33:14,128
Nick! Let's see him later!

1209
01:33:14,129 --> 01:33:15,804
When he's finally buried.

1210
01:33:15,805 --> 01:33:17,083
You're not leaving!

1211
01:33:17,084 --> 01:33:18,399
I want to see Eric!

1212
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,344
Natashia! You heard the news!

1213
01:33:20,345 --> 01:33:21,375
In the news!

1214
01:33:21,837 --> 01:33:24,250
Eric is in a state of shock!

1215
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:25,780
Damn it!

1216
01:33:26,182 --> 01:33:28,223
You're just making
up these reasons!

1217
01:33:28,224 --> 01:33:30,627
You're just going to see
that woman in the hospital!

1218
01:33:31,147 --> 01:33:32,427
I'm coming with you!

1219
01:33:32,805 --> 01:33:34,545
What else do you need from her?

1220
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:36,625
I thought,

1221
01:33:36,785 --> 01:33:38,419
we've talked about this!

1222
01:33:40,575 --> 01:33:42,189
That you're going
to forget about her!

1223
01:33:42,855 --> 01:33:45,149
And you'd never see her again?

1224
01:33:45,150 --> 01:33:47,094
Why do you still need to see her?

1225
01:33:48,217 --> 01:33:49,397
Nick, what?

1226
01:33:49,669 --> 01:33:51,113
You're really crazy!

1227
01:33:51,114 --> 01:33:53,438
Alexandra doesn't
need you anymore!

1228
01:33:56,354 --> 01:33:57,090
Hey!

1229
01:33:57,091 --> 01:33:59,011
If it's because of the doctor,

1230
01:33:59,129 --> 01:34:02,852
there's a lot of better doctors
in the hospital of San Miguel!

1231
01:34:03,931 --> 01:34:06,195
Nick, please! Let's go home!

1232
01:34:06,196 --> 01:34:08,009
Turn this car around, Nick!

1233
01:34:09,007 --> 01:34:10,277
I'm warning you!

1234
01:34:11,153 --> 01:34:13,392
If you don't listen
to me, you'll regret it!

1235
01:34:14,671 --> 01:34:15,917
Nick, what?

1236
01:34:16,829 --> 01:34:19,129
What else do you
need from that whore?

1237
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,838
Nick!

1238
01:35:58,796 --> 01:36:01,250
Aren't you going to
wait for Doctor Liwanag?

1239
01:36:01,251 --> 01:36:02,571
Not anymore.

1240
01:36:03,202 --> 01:36:06,006
I'm leaving so please
tell her thank you.

1241
01:36:06,007 --> 01:36:07,594
Yes, Mrs. Recelis.

1242
01:36:09,456 --> 01:36:10,573
Nurse?

1243
01:36:10,976 --> 01:36:13,087
I'm not Mrs. Recelis anymore.

1244
01:36:13,752 --> 01:36:14,904
Miss Avila.

1248
01:36:37,635 --> 01:36:38,905
Why are you late?

1249
01:36:44,697 --> 01:36:45,740
Hi!

1250
01:36:45,741 --> 01:36:47,605
Alex! Sweetheart!

1251
01:36:47,606 --> 01:36:49,190
This is Alex, my best friend.

1252
01:36:49,191 --> 01:36:50,779
We also live together.

1253
01:36:51,399 --> 01:36:52,447
Alex?

1254
01:36:52,448 --> 01:36:53,312
Alex.

1255
01:36:53,313 --> 01:36:54,492
She's a woman.

1256
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:56,351
Hey!

1257
01:36:56,541 --> 01:36:58,039
Alex.

1258
01:37:00,258 --> 01:37:01,491
Why, old man?

1259
01:37:02,171 --> 01:37:03,595
What were you
thinking? I'm a trans?

1260
01:37:03,596 --> 01:37:05,149
Since I have a boy's name?

1261
01:37:06,292 --> 01:37:07,542
I'm sorry.

1262
01:37:08,916 --> 01:37:10,966
I don't go to Manila often.

1263
01:37:11,992 --> 01:37:14,366
Olga, what mountain did
your boyfriend come from?

1264
01:37:14,367 --> 01:37:15,861
I don't know! Sweetheart?

1265
01:37:15,862 --> 01:37:17,774
What's the name of your town?

1266
01:37:18,511 --> 01:37:20,241
- San Rafael.
- San Rafael!

1267
01:37:20,350 --> 01:37:22,224
It's so quiet there, no disco.

1268
01:37:22,225 --> 01:37:23,745
And there's no women like.

1269
01:37:23,866 --> 01:37:24,876
Women like what?

1270
01:37:24,991 --> 01:37:27,015
Say it straight! No whores.

1271
01:37:27,016 --> 01:37:28,316
Alex, please!

1272
01:37:30,275 --> 01:37:31,655
What drinks do you want?

1273
01:37:32,466 --> 01:37:33,760

Gin tonic double.

1276
01:37:36,816 --> 01:37:37,306
Okay.

1277
01:37:37,306 --> 01:37:38,226
- Hey!
- Yes, sir?

1278
01:37:38,227 --> 01:37:39,857
How about that girl?

1279
01:37:40,374 --> 01:37:42,031
That girl over there.

1280
01:37:42,698 --> 01:37:44,327
How much should I pay for her?

1281
01:37:44,518 --> 01:37:45,518
Five.

1282
01:37:46,122 --> 01:37:47,122
Three?

1283
01:37:47,771 --> 01:37:49,389
No, five.

1284
01:37:50,063 --> 01:37:52,073
There's no discount?

1285
01:37:52,766 --> 01:37:54,296
- No.
- Okay. Call her.

1286
01:37:54,297 --> 01:37:55,358
Okay.

1287
01:37:57,123 --> 01:37:58,123
Alex?

1288
01:37:59,467 --> 01:38:00,829
Customer. With lots of money.

1289
01:38:01,896 --> 01:38:02,896
Where?

1290
01:38:03,066 --> 01:38:04,066
There.

1291
01:38:08,142 --> 01:38:11,536
He may be stingy, like the
one you gave me last night.

1292
01:38:11,537 --> 01:38:12,557
He's good.

1293
01:38:13,663 --> 01:38:14,850
Come on.

1294
01:38:15,387 --> 01:38:17,264
He even negotiated five thousand.

1295
01:38:33,434 --> 01:38:34,453
Are you hungry?

1296
01:38:34,454 --> 01:38:35,561
It won't take long.

1297
01:38:42,982 --> 01:38:44,316
Alex, don't do that!

1298
01:38:44,317 --> 01:38:47,364
You haven't had your coffee yet.

1299
01:38:47,626 --> 01:38:48,970
You're drinking

1300
01:38:48,971 --> 01:38:50,491
all kinds of medication.

1301
01:38:51,357 --> 01:38:53,627
Olga, if it wasn't for
this, I wouldn't get up.

1302
01:38:53,763 --> 01:38:56,246
You know the time will come,
and your body would pay for that.

1303
01:38:57,847 --> 01:38:59,121
Okay, fine, Olga.

1304
01:38:59,252 --> 01:39:01,918
Tell me the reason
why I have to stay alive.

1305
01:39:02,890 --> 01:39:04,765
I'm all alone in this world.

1306
01:39:06,057 --> 01:39:07,839
And always unlucky.

1307
01:39:09,570 --> 01:39:12,715
Unlucky with love,
men, and career.

1308
01:39:14,941 --> 01:39:17,730
I think I'm the most
unlucky person in the world.

1309
01:39:20,549 --> 01:39:22,086
And you, Olga, you have a child.

1310
01:39:22,249 --> 01:39:23,787
Though you're apart,

1311
01:39:23,788 --> 01:39:25,732
you have the
greatest reason to live.

1312
01:39:25,733 --> 01:39:26,850
And what do I have?

1313
01:39:29,549 --> 01:39:31,515
I think the heavens loathe me.

1314
01:39:31,516 --> 01:39:33,434
Let's talk about something else.

1315
01:39:35,672 --> 01:39:40,207
Let's be both thankful and up to now
we're still alive, and breathing.

1316
01:39:41,587 --> 01:39:43,646
And not all people are evil.

1317
01:39:43,647 --> 01:39:47,519
You're just saying that, because
of that old man courting you.

1318
01:39:49,086 --> 01:39:52,379
I don't know if he would be
good with his promise to you.

1319
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:53,679
That he would marry you.

1320
01:39:53,680 --> 01:39:56,239
That he'll love you
though you're a whore.

1321
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,762
You know Olga, all men are pigs.

1322
01:39:58,763 --> 01:40:00,866
Last night, I was with a pig!

1323
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:03,476
I think he's the most
extreme of all pigs!

1324
01:40:17,268 --> 01:40:19,737
Alex? A job. Looks rich.

1325
01:40:22,978 --> 01:40:23,978
Filipino?

1326
01:40:24,121 --> 01:40:25,376
White or black?

1327
01:40:31,833 --> 01:40:32,833
Over there.

1328
01:40:38,523 --> 01:40:39,601
Wow!

1329
01:40:39,602 --> 01:40:41,346
Wow, wow!

1330
01:40:42,132 --> 01:40:43,378
Don't mind him.

1331
01:40:45,132 --> 01:40:47,082
Okay, Alex. I'll be at the lobby.

1332
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:04,270
Come in.

1333
01:41:14,295 --> 01:41:15,508
Sandra?

1334
01:41:45,329 --> 01:41:46,603
Good luck, Olga.

1335
01:41:47,888 --> 01:41:51,138
I hope your life would
be better in San Rafael.

1336
01:41:53,713 --> 01:41:56,295
I hope you'd marry a good person.

1337
01:41:59,631 --> 01:42:00,991
Thank you, Alex.

1338
01:42:01,890 --> 01:42:02,957
Promise me.

1339
01:42:03,593 --> 01:42:04,983
If you need me,

1340
01:42:05,466 --> 01:42:07,363
you know where to find me.

1341
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:11,954
Thank you.

1342
01:42:20,095 --> 01:42:21,378
Are you sick?

1343
01:42:22,967 --> 01:42:23,967
This is nothing.

1344
01:42:24,227 --> 01:42:25,687
I'll call a doctor.

1345
01:42:26,107 --> 01:42:28,387
Or I could bring
you to the hospital.

1346
01:42:29,397 --> 01:42:31,792
I think I'll just
postpone my trip.

1347
01:42:31,931 --> 01:42:33,606
You need someone with you.

1348
01:42:33,607 --> 01:42:34,627
Don't bother.

1349
01:42:36,236 --> 01:42:38,446
No, Olga. Just do
what you have to.

1350
01:42:50,633 --> 01:42:51,633
Olga?

1351
01:42:56,682 --> 01:42:57,728
I'm pregnant.

1352
01:42:59,195 --> 01:43:01,235
- Who's the.
- I don't know.

1353
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,328
I don't know which one those men.

1354
01:43:09,256 --> 01:43:11,888
I'm really so unlucky,
and now I have this.

1355
01:43:12,027 --> 01:43:13,348
Don't you want that?

1356
01:43:13,349 --> 01:43:14,871
You'd have a child, finally!

1357
01:43:14,872 --> 01:43:17,258
You'd have a reason to live for.

1358
01:43:18,422 --> 01:43:21,371
I'd have a child but
never know his father.

1359
01:43:23,411 --> 01:43:25,014
It's still so unlucky.

1360
01:43:25,015 --> 01:43:26,328
Don't be so negative.

1361
01:43:26,329 --> 01:43:28,414
That child could change your luck!

1362
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:30,040
Maybe because of him,

1363
01:43:30,041 --> 01:43:31,938
your life would
take a different turn.

1364
01:43:33,735 --> 01:43:35,196
That may be my ride.

1365
01:43:42,004 --> 01:43:43,647
Is Alexandra Avila here?

1366
01:43:50,644 --> 01:43:51,825
Sandra?

1367
01:44:06,548 --> 01:44:07,548
Sandra.

1368
01:44:07,881 --> 01:44:08,881
Sandra.

1369
01:44:09,239 --> 01:44:10,735
You're coming with me.

1370
01:44:12,346 --> 01:44:13,771
Ever since you were gone,

1371
01:44:14,206 --> 01:44:15,940
I transferred to San Gabriel.

1372
01:44:16,821 --> 01:44:18,109
It's quiet there, Sandra.

1373
01:44:18,221 --> 01:44:19,677
Nobody would meddle with our life.

1374
01:44:20,621 --> 01:44:21,712
And one more thing,

1375
01:44:22,621 --> 01:44:24,682
nobody could come
between us anymore.

1376
01:44:26,209 --> 01:44:27,669
Natashia is gone.

1377
01:44:28,110 --> 01:44:29,754
I'm free now, Sandra.

1378
01:44:31,974 --> 01:44:33,020
Nick...

1379
01:44:33,021 --> 01:44:34,692
You wouldn't want me anymore.

1380
01:44:35,176 --> 01:44:36,390
I'll marry you!

1381
01:44:36,391 --> 01:44:37,380
Nick...

1382
01:44:37,381 --> 01:44:38,596
Whatever you are!

1383
01:44:39,462 --> 01:44:41,572
Whatever you are,
I will accept you!

1384
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:43,960
We can change all of this!

1385
01:44:45,938 --> 01:44:49,205
Nick, we're not meant for
each other, you know that.

1386
01:44:49,206 --> 01:44:51,917
From the very beginning,
we're always being separated.

1387
01:44:52,706 --> 01:44:53,719
Not anymore.

1388
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:55,878
Not anymore.

1389
01:44:58,433 --> 01:45:00,422
Nick, I'm so ashamed.

1390
01:45:01,327 --> 01:45:04,437
I can't help you
become a better person.

1391
01:45:05,913 --> 01:45:07,931
I would also be a burden to you!

1392
01:45:07,932 --> 01:45:09,024
Sandra.

1393
01:45:09,803 --> 01:45:12,102
My third baby with
Natashia survived.

1394
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:17,277
I want you to become the mother,

1395
01:45:17,408 --> 01:45:18,596
of my child.

1396
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:21,048
And my future children.

1397
01:45:22,821 --> 01:45:23,931
I hope,

1398
01:45:25,372 --> 01:45:27,397
we can start again.

1399
01:45:32,246 --> 01:45:33,746
I love you.

1400
01:45:40,421 --> 01:45:42,051
I love you, too.

1401
01:45:46,969 --> 01:45:48,700
Alexandra.

1402
01:46:14,533 --> 01:46:15,747
This is the house.

1403
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:17,624
Leo, take it from here?

1404
01:46:17,625 --> 01:46:18,745
Okay.

1405
01:46:21,778 --> 01:46:23,628
Oh, you see, there's Daddy.

1406
01:46:24,689 --> 01:46:26,358
- Say, "Hello, Daddy."
- Basil. Come.

1407
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:30,810
Basil, this is Sandra.

1408
01:46:31,284 --> 01:46:32,998
Sandra. This is Basil.

1409
01:46:32,999 --> 01:46:34,016
Hello.

1410
01:47:30,747 --> 01:47:32,099
Cervical cancer.

1411
01:47:32,715 --> 01:47:34,016
That's what you have.

1412
01:47:34,017 --> 01:47:37,435
You said you have been
feeling this for a long time.

1413
01:47:37,554 --> 01:47:39,394
You should've had it checked then.

1414
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:41,905
Do you have history
of cancer in your family?

1415
01:47:46,297 --> 01:47:48,478
My mom died of cancer.

1416
01:47:51,824 --> 01:47:53,794
What should I do now, doctor?

1417
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:56,720
Well, you may
undergo chemo therapy.

1418
01:47:57,519 --> 01:47:58,869
Hormone therapy.

1419
01:48:00,032 --> 01:48:01,158
Operation.

1420
01:48:01,517 --> 01:48:03,193
But the bottom line of this,

1421
01:48:03,708 --> 01:48:04,995
is just the same.

1422
01:48:26,535 --> 01:48:27,535
Sandra?

1423
01:48:28,354 --> 01:48:29,354
Why?

1424
01:48:32,413 --> 01:48:33,413
Nothing.

1425
01:48:38,275 --> 01:48:39,655
Is there a problem?

1426
01:48:43,092 --> 01:48:44,332
Nothing, Nick.

1427
01:48:46,850 --> 01:48:48,343
Don't you feel well?

1428
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:50,700
Why don't you tell me?

1429
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,893
I told you, it's nothing!

1430
01:48:55,243 --> 01:48:56,243
Sandra?

1431
01:48:57,942 --> 01:49:00,497
Did something happen
to your trip to Santa Inez?

1432
01:49:00,843 --> 01:49:02,586
With your retreat at the convent?

1433
01:49:03,396 --> 01:49:04,550
Tell me, Sandra!

1434
01:49:04,551 --> 01:49:06,424
I can't understand you.

1435
01:49:09,780 --> 01:49:11,335
We're together now.

1436
01:49:13,176 --> 01:49:14,870
We're enjoying it.

1437
01:49:14,871 --> 01:49:16,386
We're happy.

1438
01:49:18,975 --> 01:49:22,995
Is it that up to now you
don't believe that I don't

1439
01:49:24,375 --> 01:49:25,955
care about your past?

1440
01:49:36,110 --> 01:49:38,044
Is the wedding your problem?

1441
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:41,814
Are you afraid that.

1442
01:49:42,607 --> 01:49:44,951
I won't live up to
my promises to you?

1443
01:49:47,604 --> 01:49:48,977
Don't worry, Sandra.

1444
01:49:48,978 --> 01:49:50,315
First thing tomorrow,

1445
01:49:51,377 --> 01:49:53,988
we'll prepare our wedding.

1446
01:50:02,848 --> 01:50:04,737
I love you so much, Nick.

1447
01:50:10,968 --> 01:50:12,289
Okay, be careful.

1448
01:50:12,290 --> 01:50:13,506
You might get hurt.

1449
01:50:18,702 --> 01:50:19,702
Okay, go up.

1450
01:50:20,077 --> 01:50:21,214
Slowly.

1451
01:50:21,215 --> 01:50:23,015
- Nick! Let's eat.
- Be careful.

1452
01:50:23,299 --> 01:50:24,299
Alright.

1453
01:50:24,552 --> 01:50:25,678
Has Sandra

1454
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:26,999
eaten too?

1455
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:28,376
I haven't seen her yet.

1456
01:50:47,105 --> 01:50:48,265
Dear Nick,

1457
01:50:48,595 --> 01:50:50,645
I'm sorry. I just have to leave.

1458
01:50:51,155 --> 01:50:53,402
I can't tell you the reason.

1459
01:50:53,810 --> 01:50:54,810
Not yet.

1460
01:50:55,371 --> 01:50:57,171
But always remember that

1461
01:50:57,515 --> 01:51:00,235
I love you very much. Sandra.

1462
01:51:23,477 --> 01:51:24,837
He's really kind, Alex.

1463
01:51:25,584 --> 01:51:26,924
I just regret

1464
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:30,946
that after two months, he died.

1465
01:51:31,696 --> 01:51:35,287
Sometimes I think about
you always say back then.

1466
01:51:35,624 --> 01:51:36,700
You're unlucky.

1467
01:51:36,882 --> 01:51:38,722
Then I say, we're just the same.

1468
01:51:38,922 --> 01:51:39,945
Here I am.

1469
01:51:40,056 --> 01:51:41,325
A widower again.

1470
01:51:42,412 --> 01:51:45,321
But if I think about the
properties he left behind,

1471
01:51:45,905 --> 01:51:47,415
like this house.

1472
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:49,664
I tell myself that I
guess I'm lucky enough.

1473
01:51:50,551 --> 01:51:53,001
It's a good thing you
came here in San Rafael.

1474
01:51:53,247 --> 01:51:55,626
It's quiet here and
the people are kind.

1475
01:51:55,627 --> 01:51:56,627
Thank you.

1476
01:51:56,886 --> 01:51:59,526
Tania. Please bring
her things inside.

1477
01:51:59,741 --> 01:52:00,741
Okay.

1478
01:52:00,876 --> 01:52:02,475
Come on, go to sleep.

1479
01:52:06,783 --> 01:52:09,321
Don't worry, I won't leave you.

1480
01:52:11,039 --> 01:52:14,055
Alex, why didn't you just
tell Nick about everything?

1481
01:52:14,493 --> 01:52:17,305
About your pregnancy,
and your illness.

1482
01:52:17,933 --> 01:52:19,156
He'd help you.

1483
01:52:21,132 --> 01:52:22,782
I love Nick, Olga.

1484
01:52:24,038 --> 01:52:27,045
I don't want him to see me
suffering because of my sickness.

1485
01:52:29,109 --> 01:52:31,104
I don't want Nick
to see the time...

1486
01:52:33,317 --> 01:52:34,457
When I die.

1487
01:52:34,641 --> 01:52:35,725
Alex?

1488
01:52:35,726 --> 01:52:36,869
What I want is,

1489
01:52:38,829 --> 01:52:40,033
even if I'm gone,

1490
01:52:41,824 --> 01:52:43,899
I would still be alive in him.

1491
01:52:46,246 --> 01:52:48,196
Most of all, I don't
want him to get hurt.

1492
01:52:48,990 --> 01:52:50,606
Since what I have right now,

1493
01:52:51,101 --> 01:52:53,000
is my child with another man.

1494
01:55:08,473 --> 01:55:12,496
Tell him...

1495
01:55:13,363 --> 01:55:15,990
Tell him that I really love him.

1496
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:18,098
Nick.

1497
01:55:19,187 --> 01:55:20,628
Nick. Tell.

1498
01:55:21,433 --> 01:55:24,172
Tell him that I love him.

1499
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:32,470
That's why.

1500
01:55:36,337 --> 01:55:37,712
She doesn't want me to be unhappy.

1501
01:55:40,837 --> 01:55:42,324
She doesn't want me to get hurt.

1502
01:55:42,773 --> 01:55:44,120
She loves you, Nick.

1503
01:55:44,705 --> 01:55:46,965
Up to the last moment of her life,

1504
01:55:47,113 --> 01:55:49,358
your name is what she said.

1505
01:55:52,163 --> 01:55:53,828
She wants you to have her.

1506
01:55:54,771 --> 01:55:55,771
Nick?

1507
01:55:55,943 --> 01:55:59,233
Love that child the
same way you love her.

1508
01:55:59,974 --> 01:56:01,824
Treat her as your own.

1509
01:56:05,018 --> 01:56:06,298
What's her name?

1510
01:56:07,826 --> 01:56:08,826
Lara.

1511
01:56:19,671 --> 01:56:20,671
Basil?

1512
01:56:21,744 --> 01:56:23,004
This is Lara.

1513
01:56:24,067 --> 01:56:25,464
Watch over her.

1514
01:56:26,988 --> 01:56:28,734
- Embrace her.
- Watch over her.

1515
01:56:29,058 --> 01:56:31,070
- Slowly.
- Love her, okay?

1516
01:56:31,651 --> 01:56:32,741
Love her.

1517
01:56:32,927 --> 01:56:33,961
You sit down.

1518
01:56:33,962 --> 01:56:34,656
Sit down.

1519
01:56:34,657 --> 01:56:36,191
Protect her.

1520
01:56:36,192 --> 01:56:38,303
And don't hurt her.

1521
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:43,923
Here's your baby.

1522
01:56:44,158 --> 01:56:45,558
Nice baby.

1523
01:56:46,017 --> 01:56:47,142
Careful.

1524
01:56:47,269 --> 01:56:48,499
Careful.

1525
01:56:50,051 --> 01:56:52,761
Basil, this is your baby sister.

1526
01:56:53,961 --> 01:56:55,141
Love her, okay?

1527
01:56:57,183 --> 01:56:58,434
When did she die?

1528
01:56:58,939 --> 01:57:00,173
Last Saturday.

1529
01:57:04,786 --> 01:57:05,930
When was she buried?

1530
01:57:06,736 --> 01:57:07,846
Yesterday.

1531
01:57:08,546 --> 01:57:10,892
Why didn't you tell me?

1532
01:57:10,893 --> 01:57:13,185
She was adamant
with her instructions

1533
01:57:13,186 --> 01:57:16,019
to contact you for Lara,
only after her burial.

1534
01:57:21,352 --> 01:57:22,952
Where did you bury her?

1535
01:57:40,838 --> 01:57:42,519
I'm sorry!

1536
01:57:43,796 --> 01:57:46,576
I'm sorry!

1537
01:58:49,426 --> 01:58:50,830
- Gilbert?
- Hi, doctor.

1538
01:58:51,569 --> 01:58:52,942
Uncle Leo.

1539
01:58:53,565 --> 01:58:54,615
Basil!

1540
01:58:54,894 --> 01:58:57,348
It seems his birthday
party is happier now,

1541
01:58:57,349 --> 01:58:59,105
compared to last year.

1542
01:58:59,294 --> 01:59:00,494
Why are you late?

1543
01:59:01,580 --> 01:59:03,827
I had to do an
emergency operation.

1544
01:59:04,188 --> 01:59:06,988
I needed to do by-pass
with one of my patients.

1545
01:59:08,307 --> 01:59:09,307
Where's Dad?

1546
01:59:10,024 --> 01:59:12,023
He's upstairs, waiting for you.

1547
01:59:13,031 --> 01:59:14,269
And Lara?

1548
01:59:14,470 --> 01:59:16,049
They're both upstairs, come on.

1549
01:59:18,266 --> 01:59:19,266
Bert?

1550
01:59:19,728 --> 01:59:20,732
Jun.

1551
01:59:20,733 --> 01:59:21,733
Wait.

1552
01:59:45,560 --> 01:59:46,686
Basil.

1553
02:00:17,357 --> 02:00:22,365

1554
02:00:22,687 --> 02:00:27,639

02:00:49,546 --> 02:00:51,865
Dad!

1558
02:00:55,083 --> 02:00:56,083
Dad?

1559
02:01:00,707 --> 02:01:01,909
Basil...

1560
02:01:09,769 --> 02:01:10,769
Dad!

1561
02:01:35,256 --> 02:01:37,289
Our brother Nicholas has gone,

1562
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:39,802
to his rest in the
peace with Christ.

1563
02:01:40,332 --> 02:01:42,880
With faith and
hope and eternal life,

1564
02:01:43,421 --> 02:01:46,791
let us commend him to the
loving mercy of our Father.

1565
02:01:47,157 --> 02:01:49,794
And assist him with our prayers.

1566
02:01:50,991 --> 02:01:52,655
He became God's son

1567
02:01:52,656 --> 02:01:56,818
through baptism and was
often fed at the table of our Lord.

1568
02:01:56,961 --> 02:01:58,885
May the Lord now welcome him

1569
02:01:58,886 --> 02:02:01,186
to the table of God's
children in heaven.

1570
02:02:01,406 --> 02:02:03,030
And with all the sayings,

1571
02:02:03,031 --> 02:02:06,704
may he inherit the
promise of eternal life.

1572
02:02:08,568 --> 02:02:10,582
Let us also pray to the Lord

1573
02:02:10,583 --> 02:02:12,013
for ourselves.

1574
02:02:12,619 --> 02:02:14,080
May we who mourn,

1575
02:02:14,181 --> 02:02:17,208
be reunited one
day with our brother.

1576
02:02:18,715 --> 02:02:19,715
Together,

1577
02:02:19,899 --> 02:02:22,669
may we meet, Christ, Jesus.

1578
02:02:23,065 --> 02:02:24,192
When He

1579
02:02:24,450 --> 02:02:25,870
who is our life

1580
02:02:26,428 --> 02:02:27,805
shall appear...

1581
02:02:28,028 --> 02:02:29,728
I will adopt Lara.

1582
02:02:30,059 --> 02:02:32,146
This is her birth certificate.

1583
02:02:34,449 --> 02:02:36,699
Prepare her adoption
papers right away.

1584
02:02:40,678 --> 02:02:42,630
She will become an Alonso-Lopez.

1585
02:02:45,444 --> 02:02:46,444
Leo?

1586
02:02:47,208 --> 02:02:48,762
You're the only one who'd know

1587
02:02:48,763 --> 02:02:50,903
that Lara is not my real child.

1588
02:02:54,687 --> 02:02:55,860
Be careful

1589
02:02:55,964 --> 02:02:57,244
with this secret.

1590
02:02:57,823 --> 02:02:59,293
But when the time comes,

1591
02:02:59,803 --> 02:03:01,482
and Lara needs to know it,

1592
02:03:01,684 --> 02:03:04,389
as well as Basil that
they're not real siblings,

1593
02:03:04,390 --> 02:03:05,970
never hesitate,

1594
02:03:07,176 --> 02:03:08,656
tell them.

1595
02:03:09,240 --> 02:03:10,240
Why?

1596
02:03:10,579 --> 02:03:12,039
Why do they need to know?

1597
02:03:12,621 --> 02:03:13,621
Leo.

1598
02:03:15,683 --> 02:03:17,517
Love is very mystical.

1599
02:03:19,427 --> 02:03:20,880
True love

1600
02:03:23,271 --> 02:03:24,586
is everlasting.

1601
02:03:50,693 --> 02:03:52,312
I love you, Nick.

1602
02:03:54,391 --> 02:03:55,881
I love you too.

1603
02:04:01,456 --> 02:04:02,832
Basil and Lara.

1604
02:04:03,269 --> 02:04:05,235
Since you wish to contract.

1605
02:04:05,236 --> 02:04:06,669
Holy Matrimony,

1606
02:04:07,086 --> 02:04:09,085
please join your right hands,

1607
02:04:09,086 --> 02:04:10,995
and express your intention

1608
02:04:10,996 --> 02:04:13,432
before God and His church.

1609
02:04:13,741 --> 02:04:14,799
Lara?

1610
02:04:15,016 --> 02:04:17,085
Do you take Basil here, present,

1611
02:04:17,086 --> 02:04:18,780
for your lawful husband,

1612
02:04:18,781 --> 02:04:22,451
according to the Rites of
our Holy Mother the church?

1613
02:04:23,046 --> 02:04:24,153
Yes, I do.

1614
02:04:25,256 --> 02:04:27,936
Do you give yourself
to him as his wife?

1615
02:04:28,156 --> 02:04:29,275
Yes, I do.

1616
02:04:29,276 --> 02:04:32,128
Do you accept him as
your lawful husband?

1617
02:04:32,516 --> 02:04:33,516
Yes, I do.

1618
02:04:33,996 --> 02:04:34,996
Basil?

1619
02:04:35,246 --> 02:04:38,865
Do you take Lara here,
present for your lawful wife

1620
02:04:38,866 --> 02:04:42,426
according to the Rites of
our Holy Mother the church?

1621
02:04:42,706 --> 02:04:43,680
Yes, I do.

1622
02:04:43,681 --> 02:04:46,715
Do you give yourself
to her as her husband?

1623
02:04:46,716 --> 02:04:47,796
Yes, I do.

1624
02:04:48,322 --> 02:04:50,912
Do you accept her
as your lawful wife?

1625
02:04:52,180 --> 02:04:53,340
Yes, I do.

1626
02:05:03,097 --> 02:05:04,412
Wear this ring.

1627
02:05:05,267 --> 02:05:07,510
As a sign of my love and loyalty.

1628
02:05:08,927 --> 02:05:12,690
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

1629
02:05:20,717 --> 02:05:22,337
Wear this ring,

1630
02:05:22,927 --> 02:05:25,377
as a sign of my love and loyalty.

1631
02:05:25,501 --> 02:05:29,404
