"LAYETANA" BOARDING HOUSE

00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:00,289
"PUNCTUALITY" DRY CLEANER'S

4
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,730
I'm coming, I'm coming!

5
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,379
What do you want?

6
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,440
For you to wash this suit for me.
- We don't open til 9!

7
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,159
Well, it's just...

8
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,460
Oh!, but it's not polite
to let a client wait in the street.

9
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,870
We'll have to open sooner, yes sir.
But what can you do...

10
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,520
it's because of the union.

11
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,470
I need it as soon as possible.

12
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's see.

13
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,930
Nice label.
No, no, don't say anything to me!

14
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,230
My friend, this is quality!

15
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,230
From Tarrasa, very nice.
Yes, sir.

16
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,010
And it will be like new.
I'm telling you...

17
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,590
I'm an expert with this material.

18
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,870
Ok, can you clean it, yes o no?

19
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,059
You're asking me!

20
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,640
I'm the guru of stains.

21
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,599
Me!

22
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,840
I can get out ink, blood, gasoline!

23
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,940
Heavy oils.

24
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,640
Even peach,
p- e-a-c-h.

25
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,999
And that's really something.

26
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,540
There's nothing I can't get out!

27
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,770
So, when should I pick it up?

28
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,109
Miguelin!

29
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,630
When? Ah!

30
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,420
That, that's the question.

31
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,200
This isn't one of those suits...
you take to just any cleaner!

32
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:19,619
No, no sir, no.

33
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,670
This suit is filtered.

34
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,600
Filtered!

35
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,849
Miguelin!

36
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,709
Enough.

37
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,680
Can it be ready by tonight?

38
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,750
I'm going out of town,
and I'll pay whatever is needed.

39
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,280
Well, we'll make an effort,
and when I say make an effort...

40
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,820
that's what you'll get.

41
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,209
Here.

42
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,699
Read, read.

43
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,040
Punctuality, that's my motto.

44
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,379
Fine, I'm ready to pay.

45
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,309
Miguelin!

46
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,649
I'm here, papa.

47
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,089
Are you an idiot?

48
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,300
Go take that suit and
take it to the press.

49
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,560
My boy will take it to your house, ok?

50
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,819
Could you give me the address?

51
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,210
There's no need,
I'll come pick it up.

52
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,149
You're late,
what happened?

53
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,690
The next train won't leave until 12.

54
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,510
There won't be another train for us.

55
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,559
Things have changed.
- Why?

56
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,869
You didn't find the money?

57
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,720
I found the old man,
but he didn't have the money.

58
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,840
He came to the office and resigned.

59
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,120
Then they sent out the
official letter with the check.

60
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,650
He had plenty of time to cash it.

61
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,909
You're useless,

62
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,460
it still hasn't been sent.

63
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,970
Then... you failed?

64
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,200
Failing... is nothing.

65
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,950
Something else happened.

66
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,950
No.
You're scaring me, Enrique.

67
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,330
You've...?

68
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,960
How terrible!

69
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,079
Where are you going?
- Let me go...

70
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,640
I don't want to end up in jail,
you see!

71
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,330
Quiet, people can hear!
- I won't be quiet, I want to go!

72
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,860
Let me go!

73
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,859
Go up.

74
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,360
Go up!

75
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,510
Get in!

76
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,479
Sit down!

77
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,520
I want to leave, I don't want to know
anything else! It disgusts me!

78
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,060
Get a hold of yourself!

79
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,450
Poor man.

80
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,490
He was so unhappy, and...

81
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,060
You're a coward!

82
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,350
I'm sorry,
we've lost our heads.

83
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,980
Forgive me, Clara.

84
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,700
If you want, you can leave,
but I need you.

85
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,900
We've been so happy...

86
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,450
Can we be happy still?

87
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,240
But still, I understand that
I have no right to force you.

88
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,410
But we can go away, Enrique.

89
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,540
The tickets are still good
for the next train.

90
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,359
Go empty handed?

91
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,799
No.

92
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,300
And if they find us?

93
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,390
The situation isn't so bad.

94
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,580
That man lived alone.
Isolated, with no family.

95
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,910
It won't be easy for them
to find the body.

96
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,569
I've hidden it well.

97
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,070
Oh, it's terrible!

98
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,330
I promise you that it
couldn't be avoided.

99
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,799
I had to protect myself.

100
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,460
He swore he didn't have the money.

101
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,990
I thought he was lying.

102
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,259
I tried to see if that was true.

103
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,760
We fought, and...

104
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,799
After...

105
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,300
When it was over...

106
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,010
I found this letter
from the administration.

107
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,030
But the money wasn't there,
like you thought.

108
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,200
They said that considering
that he asked to resign...

109
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,790
...and as a special case...

110
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,080
...the company decided
to provide him a sum...

111
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,040
...and that they would send
the check today.

112
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,640
I'm so sorry, Enrique.

113
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,050
I wish we'd never gotten
involved in this mess.

114
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,289
What will we do now?

115
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,619
I've planned it all out.

116
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,030
You'll copy his signature
from a letter.

117
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,519
I'll forge it.

118
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,830
We also have to find out
when they'll send the check from the factory.

119
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,069
It should be there.

120
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,199
But...

121
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,469
...I can't go back to the office.

122
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,970
I asked for eight days off.

123
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,150
You don't remember?

124
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,149
Think up some reason.

125
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,260
Tell them you're not going
to your aunt's house.

126
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,470
That she's coming to see you.

127
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,010
Make it work.

128
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,680
You're going to help me,
right, Clara?

129
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,090
Now is when we have to
stick together the most.

130
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,990
Yes. To commit a crime.

131
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,079
Forget it.

132
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,180
I don't want to hear you
talk about it any more.

133
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,499
Never again.

134
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,220
Promise me.

135
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,950
Now we have to go our own way.

136
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,089
Trust me.

137
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,400
I'll see you at your place at noon.

138
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,300
Pedro, kick us the ball!

139
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,600
You want to trade?
- Get that away!

140
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,290
They're worthless.
You think I'm stupid?

141
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,940
Sure you are.
They're interesting.

142
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,659
Look!

143
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,555
The adventures of Agent X-9.

144
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,740
And here...
The Ghost Submarine.

145
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,129
What?
- No.

146
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,620
The harmonica is worth more.
I'll give you my card collection.

147
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:50,490
I'd rather have the comics.
Agent X-9 is great.

148
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,809
Bah!

149
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,440
You don't like this either?

150
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,050
It's a glass eye.

151
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,929
You like it, huh?

152
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,430
I'll give you my ball.

153
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,640
Well, what do you say?
- Take it.

154
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,019
You win.

155
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,300
Along with the harmonica,
I want the top.

156
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,579
That's not the deal.

157
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,890
You can't take it back.
The harmonica or nothing.

158
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,100
A piece of glass?
The harmonica is worth more.

159
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,409
That's true.

160
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,370
Don't be stingy,
give them to him!

161
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,369
The eye is worth it.

162
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,600
Try to work it out.
Here comes your dad.

163
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,150
Take it. And know
that you win the trade.

164
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,270
Hi, dad.

165
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,890
Hi.

166
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,870
Why are you looking at me like that?

167
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,940
I was just going to school.

168
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,779
I was waiting for Miguelin.

169
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,280
We always go together.

170
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,800
Look what Antonio gave me
for his harmonica.

171
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,780
I don't like you trading things,
or hanging out in the street.

172
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,959
Bye.

173
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,660
Bye, dad!
Bye, Mr. Pérez!

174
00:12:52,695 --> 00:12:54,160
Bye, Pedrito!

175
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,750
Don't wait for Miguelin.

176
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,890
I stopped by the shop and his father
won't let him to go to school today.

177
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,809
He's punished.

178
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,710
That's not having a father,
it's having a drill sergeant.

179
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,070
Hi, Enrique.
How are your sales going?

180
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,519
Same as usual.

181
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,779
How many cars have you sold?

182
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,860
Hey! It's not like
selling umbrellas.

183
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,000
Sorry?
- Clara?

184
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,860
Oh, it's you?

185
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,619
What do you want?

186
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,280
Just to know that you're there.

187
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,799
Now I feel better.

188
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,279
You called me for that!

189
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,780
You're crazy!

190
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,810
And tell me,
did you do what I asked?

191
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,219
Did you get it?

192
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,609
No, I still haven't.

193
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,550
But don't worry.
I'll get it for you.

194
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,240
It's ok, honey.
I don't have the words to...

195
00:13:59,275 --> 00:14:00,740
Don't look for them!

196
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,320
This is the last thing I'll do for you!

197
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,330
You managed to convince me, but...

198
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,480
We'll talk later!

199
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,090
What's there to talk about?

200
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,990
Haven't we been in agreement
since this morning?

201
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,579
Ok.

202
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,600
It's not a good time to
talk about it, Enrique!

203
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,409
Enough!

204
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,910
I'm hanging up!

205
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,300
I'm hanging up.

206
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,870
<i>If you knew how much I love you...</i>

207
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,320
<i>My life had no direction
until I found you.</i>

208
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,739
<i>Kiss me, my love!</i>

209
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,730
<i>It's the happiest day of my life!</i>

210
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,650
<i>You've just been listening to the
third chapter of the radio program...</i>

211
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,220
<i>...Love after Midnight.
Tomorrow...</i>

212
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,950
Boy!

213
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,950
Yes, sir!
- Get me the phone.

214
00:16:22,985 --> 00:16:24,450
It's all yours.

215
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,460
What number should I dial?
- Leave it.

216
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,600
CLARA'S OFFICE

217
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:41,270
PUNCTUALITY
CLEANERS

218
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,189
Hello?

219
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,820
Constructions, Inc?

220
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,929
Is this Pepita?

221
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,900
Pepita?
No!

222
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,780
You've got the wrong person!

223
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,030
I'm telling you I'm not Pepita!

224
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,170
Could you please call for Clara.

225
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,030
Yes, the secretary
to the judicial assessor.

226
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,779
Hurry up, sweetie.

227
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,209
Sweetie, me?

228
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,130
Is there something wrong
with the inside of your ears?

229
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,080
Does it not get through, you beast?

230
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,540
Hi... Clara, my dear.

231
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,699
Now listen!

232
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,100
Here there are no Pepitas,
or Claras, or dears!

233
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,780
Do you think this is a harem?

234
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,470
I've been waiting for you
for half an hour.

235
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,440
Yes, in the cafe.

236
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,920
Hurry on over, beautiful.

237
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,570
Beautiful?

238
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,770
Son of a bitch!

239
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,039
You're lucky with the ladies.

240
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,270
Even if they take their time,
at least they do show up.

241
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,570
I'll wait for her out in the sun.
Keep the change.

242
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,370
Thanks.
Good bye!

243
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,270
Has "Destino" arrived yet?
- Yes, sir.

244
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,379
A smaller bill.

245
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,529
Do you have change?

246
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,425
I have an agreement with
the bank at the corner...

247
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,400
...they don't sell magazines,
and I don't change bills.

248
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,270
Ok, don't get upset.

249
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,439
Here, this will work!

250
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,940
Thank you.

251
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,269
Do you know what time it is?

252
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,030
It's around 1:15.

253
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,280
Women are all the same.

254
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,509
Oh, yeah?
- Sure.

255
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:55,205
If the girl's going to show up at 2,
why does she tell you to wait at 1?

256
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,900
My husband was going to take over
for me at 12, so why isn't he here yet?

257
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,160
But what's there to complain about?
You've got a booth where you can read.

258
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,350
Good day!
- Engracia!

259
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,910
Tell me.
- Has my fiancé come yet?

260
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,690
No, miss, I haven't seen
him all morning.

261
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,380
Thanks.
- You're welcome, happy to help.

262
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,460
You frightened me.

263
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,340
Engracia told me she
didn't see you come in, so...

264
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,130
She couldn't see me,
I came in through the window.

265
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,660
Has something happened?

266
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,160
Two people followed me.

267
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,609
I'm worried they might be cops.

268
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:16,290
Cops?
- I don't see anyone.

269
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,570
Did you bring the signature?

270
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,609
Tell me...

271
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,690
...do you know when
they'll send the check?

272
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,420
And if they followed you here?

273
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,240
I'll tell you what we'll do,
but answer me first.

274
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,080
What about the check?

275
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:39,749
This afternoon...

276
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,750
...a courier will take it to the factory.

277
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,750
I found out all about it, Enrique.

278
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,270
He told me himself
at 8:30 or 9:00.

279
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,010
I'll be there.

280
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,260
But if they police followed you
you can't leave yet.

281
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,790
They'll get you.

282
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,130
Maybe they're watching
the house right now?

283
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,860
Calm down.

284
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,320
I think I lost them.

285
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,380
Plus, I thought of a great story
in case they take me in.

286
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,340
It's important to think quickly.

287
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,599
What will you do?

288
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,140
They've got to think I'm waiting for you
in the cafe down below, right?

289
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,440
What does that matter?

290
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,040
Don't ask questions.

291
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,980
I'll explain it to you later.

292
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,520
You want to help me, right?

293
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,609
Yes.

294
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,640
But more than anything, I want
all of this to be over soon.

295
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,059
It will be.

296
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,560
I promise you.

297
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,490
Now call the housekeeper.

298
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,640
Call her and tell her to go
to the cafe and to look for me.

299
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,680
Engracia!
Engracia!

300
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,879
Yes, miss!

301
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,530
Please, could you come up here.
- Right away, miss.

302
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,800
Is something wrong?
Are you feeling well?

303
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,400
No, nothing.
I'm just in a hurry.

304
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,950
Could you go ask for my fiancé.
He should be in Don Pancho, the cafe.

305
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,060
It's very important, please hurry.

306
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,230
I'm waiting for someone,
and I hope he's here.

307
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,220
If he's not in the bar,
he should be at the corner...

308
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,750
He's got to be there,
because we had arranged to meet now.

309
00:24:05,785 --> 00:24:07,732
I'm going right away.
- Hurry, Engracia!

310
00:24:07,767 --> 00:24:09,680
Don't worry, I'll be there in a jiffy.

311
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,240
And now could you tell me
what this farce is all about?

312
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,739
Sure.

313
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,420
You'll understand soon.

314
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,390
The housekeeper won't find you.

315
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,440
You're wrong.

316
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,569
When she gets there,

317
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,480
I'll be waiting calmly at the corner.

318
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,980
A great plan.

319
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,120
No one will suspect me
and you won't be able to say anything.

320
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,140
You worried me, Clara.

321
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:48,370
It's a shame that you
can't control your nerves.

322
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,200
If the police interrogate you...

323
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,560
...what will you say?

324
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,149
Me...

325
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,650
Yes.

326
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,270
Women don't know how to shut up.

327
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,100
That's why they have to be silenced.

328
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,870
Enrique...

329
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,030
What's come over you?

330
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:13,630
Why are you looking at me like that?

331
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,060
A prolonged silence.

332
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,299
You're crazy!

333
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,100
Very prolonged!

334
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,800
What are you doing?

335
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:29,090
Calm down, Riquin.
Calm down.

336
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,250
Oh, you're here just in time, Engracia.

337
00:25:31,285 --> 00:25:32,439
Look at this.

338
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,170
When he gets stubborn,
he's impossible.

339
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,040
He has some thing
for shrubs and light posts...

340
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,670
Take this up for me while
I take care of Riquin, could you?

341
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,410
I'd love to Doña Ernestina,
but I'm in a hurry, you see.

342
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,570
They sent me on an important
mission, and you see...

343
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,509
Oh, ok then!

344
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,170
You heard her, Riquin,
it won't happen. She's a meanie.

345
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,500
You'll come down later,
you see how much mommy has to carry.

346
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,980
Come on, angel.

347
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,740
Be good.

348
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,120
Come on, don't make this difficult.

349
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,110
Come on, my pretty one.
Go on in.

350
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,290
No, Riquin, no!

351
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,670
Oh, don't make
me nervous.

352
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,670
It's all the
housekeeper's fault.

353
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,530
And later she'll want
to charge me money.

354
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:17,280
I'm coming, dear.
I'm coming.

355
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,630
But don't scratch at the door.

356
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,490
Excuse me,
young man, please.

357
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,219
Have you seen don Enrique?

358
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,320
A tall man, dark hair, around 40.
He stops by most days.

359
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,199
He left just a bit ago.
- Did he?

360
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,150
He should be outside
waiting for his girl.

361
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,130
Thank you very much.

362
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,250
I'm so glad to find you.
I thought you must have left.

363
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,389
What's wrong, Engracia?

364
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,900
Miss Clara sent me to look for you.

365
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,179
You should go find her at once.

366
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,960
She says she's waiting for a visitor,
and she wants you to be there.

367
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,360
It seemed strange to me that
she was taking so long!

368
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,059
Did she say who it was?

369
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,500
No, sir, but
she seemed frightened.

370
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,249
Frightened?

371
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,170
How strange.
Let's go.

372
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,030
Well, if you need anything...
you know I'm here.

373
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,420
Just a moment, Engracia.

374
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,660
Come up here with me,
in case she needs anything.

375
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:48,190
I'll stay and have lunch here.

376
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,090
Come on, Riquin, be a good little boy.
Listen to me, please.

377
00:27:53,125 --> 00:27:54,680
Don't be such a bother.

378
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,920
I'm very worried, I don't know
what's going on with him.

379
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,620
I've never seen him like this.

380
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,550
Could something have happened to her?
- What could have happened?

381
00:28:05,585 --> 00:28:07,050
She must be in the garden.

382
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,940
Careful! Maybe some
thieves have gone in?

383
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,950
Clara!

384
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,240
Clara!

385
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,200
See to everything as
quickly as possible...

386
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,690
...and hand the report
to the police court.

387
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,230
Yes, sir.

388
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,130
For the orderlies.

389
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,549
Look at this, Inspector.

390
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,600
I found it in the victim's pocket.

391
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,090
We've finished the inspection.

392
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,890
Ok, you can take her out.

393
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,390
Poor man.

394
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,750
What a tragedy!
- Yes.

395
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,450
What a tragedy!

396
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,740
Lozano!

397
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,920
Make sure they analyze
the ink from this pen.

398
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,090
I want to know if it's the same
one that was used here.

399
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,630
Yes, sir.

400
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,560
I'll wait for you at the station at 4.

401
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,380
Maybe you'll feel calmer
in the afternoon...

402
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,200
...you can revise your statements
with some further details to help us.

403
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,039
Hopefully you can do so.

404
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,439
I don't know what to think.

405
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,909
I feel like I've lost my mind.

406
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,229
That's normal.
Try to calm down.

407
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,780
Let's go!

408
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,270
Don't be like that.

409
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,200
Do you want to come up to my apartment?
I can prepare you something hot.

410
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,780
Poor dear.

411
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,720
This case is a relief, right?
- Just what I needed.

412
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,500
Hopefully I got lucky this time.

413
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,520
I know how I stand before the chief.

414
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,040
He's not quick to praise.
But he's not a bad person.

415
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,180
No, I understand
why he's like that.

416
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,320
It's a year since I've cracked a case,
it makes sense he's not happy with me.

417
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,930
But I'd like to change his mind
by doing something really well.

418
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:50,939
You'll make it, Inspector.

419
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,440
And I'll help you.

420
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,710
Look. My throat is dry
from so much talking.

421
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,380
Let's get a drink.

422
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,340
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
What will you have?

423
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,819
A Jerez?
- Ok.

424
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,590
Two, dry.
- What would you like to eat?

425
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,210
Just some answers,
but clear ones, ok.

426
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,999
Sorry?

427
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,500
When did you come
in to work today?

428
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,850
I always come in at 10
and I'm here til 6.

429
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,349
Do you remember a face?

430
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,700
Well I can describe Marilyn Monroe,
with all of the details.

431
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,859
Show him the picture.

432
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,240
Hey, now, I've seen all kinds,
in all possible poses, and some of them...

433
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,729
I know this girl.

434
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:28,380
Sure! She comes
in here all the time.

435
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,600
And not bad looking, right?

436
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,340
Did she come in today?

437
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,360
Are you cops?

438
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,979
Hell!

439
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,819
Did something happen?

440
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,640
You're the one who needs to answer.

441
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,139
Yes, sir.

442
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,589
But no, sir.
She didn't come in today.

443
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,670
But her boyfriend was waiting
for her for a while.

444
00:31:44,705 --> 00:31:46,149
How long?
- Half an hour.

445
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,380
He had a couple of beers
and was reading.

446
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,190
Did you see what he was reading?
Think hard.

447
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,390
Some novel.
I don't know the title.

448
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,960
And the magazine Destino.

449
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,730
Are you sure it was Destino?

450
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,420
Well sure. The cover
with the city in the rain.

451
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:04,000
Look. Just like this one.

452
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,079
Ok, and then what did he do?

453
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,010
He called the girl, set a time to meet
and went to the street to wait for her.

454
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,039
Did he see her?

455
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,899
No, sir.

456
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,430
Oh, but after a bit
a woman came to find him.

457
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,030
I don't know if they found her.

458
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,500
Ok, let's go.

459
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,625
Come to the station,
at 4, on the dot.

460
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,450
Yes, sir. But can you tell me
what's going on?

461
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,400
Yes. She's been killed.

462
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:27,650
Don't you want the Jerez?

463
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,830
He said he bought Destino
when he left the cafe.

464
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,510
His statement isn't so clear,
is it, Inspector?

465
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,140
Yes, now it's making more sense.

466
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,790
The level of detail he used
seemed strange to me.

467
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,690
I've now realized that you've
started to suspect him.

468
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,010
He hasn't been very nice, has he?

469
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:47,960
It's not a question of nice.
More like a hunch.

470
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,320
Everything seems so strange.

471
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,590
That strange visitor that
she was waiting for,

472
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,010
her death just after
the housekeeper left...

473
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,860
I don't know.

474
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,580
Are you the owner of the kiosk?

475
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:10,939
No, sir, my wife is.

476
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,030
I'm just here,
while she has lunch.

477
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,150
Tell her we need to
ask her some questions.

478
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,820
We'll wait for her at 4,
in the station.

479
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:19,300
Hey, did she hit a policeman?

480
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,850
It wouldn't surprise me.
She's a fighter.

481
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,060
It's nothing like that.
Just asking her some questions.

482
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,900
And me convincing her to go.

483
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,430
We'll wait for her.

484
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,650
Are you wearing
suspenders or a belt?

485
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,660
Neither. They stay up
on their own.

486
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,500
In that case you'll convince her.

487
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,030
At 4 o'clock.

488
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,610
I stopped by again today.
He won't be going to school today either.

489
00:33:45,645 --> 00:33:47,099
His father won't let him!

490
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,830
He's got a terrible temper.

491
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,250
One time, he threw
a huge iron at me,

492
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,700
and it flew just over my head.

493
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,790
One of these days,
Miguelin's going to run away.

494
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,580
He wants to be in the Navy.

495
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,580
I'd like to be a sailor too.

496
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,790
Yeah, but he's got it bad.

497
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,240
His dad's trying to get him
to be a dry cleaner.

498
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,560
He says they're
"from a long line of cleaners"!

499
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,380
Look who's coming!

500
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,710
Hi, dad!
- Hi.

501
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,619
Are you going to school?

502
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:22,110
Yeah, but I want to
spend time with you first.

503
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,500
See you later.
- Bye.

504
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,860
Wait for me, Antonio!
I'm coming down! -Ok!

505
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,309
Hi, Julia.

506
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,970
What's going on, serious again?

507
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,060
What's going on? He's hungry again.
Right, dad?

508
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,199
What are you doing here, Pedro?

509
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,050
You made me get your lunch ready early,
and now you're late for school.

510
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,670
I'm going now, mom!

511
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,559
Say, dad...

512
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,360
Is it true that being a policeman
is more important than a cleaner or a sailor?

513
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,590
Everything is important
if it's done well.

514
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,220
But being a policeman is harder,
and it's more responsibility.

515
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,050
Sure.

516
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,590
Cleaning a cover or a suit?

517
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,759
Woman's work!

518
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,850
But catching a criminal...

519
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,660
...well! You have to be a man
for that. Right, dad?

520
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,770
Leave your father alone.
Can't you see he's tired?

521
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,850
Go ahead, eat. Eating it
cold won't do you any good.

522
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,370
I already ate a whole plate of them,
and they were really good.

523
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,610
Sure they're good.

524
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,050
You'd eat pasta every day.

525
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,560
Are you worried?
What's wrong?

526
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,800
Something really important fell into my lap,
and I need to have it work out.

527
00:35:59,835 --> 00:36:01,300
And why haven't you yet?

528
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,689
It wouldn't be the first time.

529
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,550
But this case seems particularly difficult,

530
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,840
dark, with very few clues.

531
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,780
What are clues, dad?

532
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,510
It's something that gets us started,
it leads us to the criminal.

533
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,910
Fingerprints, a word
that seems unimportant,

534
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,170
a personal object,
and sometimes...

535
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:23,400
...even a look that
shows doubt or uncertainty.

536
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,925
And all criminals
leave clues?

537
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,330
Stop bothering your dad,
and leave right at once!

538
00:36:28,365 --> 00:36:30,700
But mom, can't you see I
need to become a policeman!

539
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,320
No, son. One useless
one in the family is enough!

540
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,660
Bye, dad.

541
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:01,650
Bye, son.
- Bye.

542
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,050
Finish that up.
Then I'll make you a coffee.

543
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,780
But have some
tuna empanadillas first.

544
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,850
I wish you wouldn't say you're
useless in front of him.

545
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,719
You're right.

546
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,350
But for the past few days
I can't control my nerves.

547
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,080
The thing is, the chief
doesn't trust me.

548
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,170
But you have to
work with enthusiasm,

549
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,549
without thinking about him.

550
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,120
With only one thought...
to make it happen!

551
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,540
Don't you remember how much
you had to fight to marry me?

552
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,829
And you made it work.

553
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:37,270
And why? Because you knew to not
worry about my father not trusting you.

554
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,030
And in the end,
you proved your worth to him.

555
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,750
Of course, maybe you're
sorry for all that now?

556
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,460
Thanks.

557
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,260
I'm sorry I'm late,
but Riquin didn't want to come in.

558
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:02,000
He's scared of uniforms.

559
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,060
Me, on the contrary...

560
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:18,690
I must say that very rarely does
a statement look at certain as yours.

561
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,430
You've made sure not
to leave anything out.

562
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,190
Tell me, ma'am.
- I beg your pardon, Inspector.

563
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,780
Miss, ok!
Miss!

564
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,630
Oh, ok!

565
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,560
Then tell me, miss.

566
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,309
According to your first statement,

567
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,900
you were heading to your apartment
when you met the housekeeper?

568
00:38:35,935 --> 00:38:37,400
Yes, sir.

569
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,660
How far was this from the door?

570
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,460
Five steps.

571
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,650
I remember I was carrying
several packages in my left hand...

572
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,590
...and Riquin's leash in my right.

573
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,899
You're certain?

574
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,240
Yes, I always hold the leash,
so he won't run away.

575
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,120
I'm asking if it was
five steps from the doorway?

576
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,530
I don't know, maybe a bit more.

577
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,180
- Seven or eight.
- No, it wasn't more than five.

578
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,870
- But be quiet for now.
- No, I won't!

579
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,410
What kind of woman!
- it's not important.

580
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,060
And from the moment that
Miss Clara gave you this task...

581
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,530
and when you met this woman
how much time passed?

582
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,960
Very little, about two minutes.

583
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,620
As long as it takes
to go down the stairs...

584
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:15,059
...and put on my coat.
- Are you sure?

585
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,070
You didn't stop at the doorway?
Try to remember.

586
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,150
Oh, no! I remember perfectly.

587
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,779
I didn't even take
off my apron.

588
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,380
She seemed so worried that I
left right away to find the gentleman.

589
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:27,610
When you stopped talking to the lady,
did you stay long in the street?

590
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,309
Do you remember?

591
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,500
Of course, the thing is
you don't give me time to talk!

592
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,970
I was carrying so much,
and some oranges fell...

593
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,959
In the street?

594
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,370
No, sir,
at the doorway!

595
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,799
Then I went up...

596
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,390
Are you sure you didn't see
anyone in the stairwell?

597
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,940
Not a soul. Then I went up...
- You didn't hear anything?

598
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,880
Steps, voices,
the sound of a door?

599
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:50,120
I have very good hearing, Mr. Inspector,
You know, it's as good as Riquin's.

600
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,510
Right, my treasure?
So no, I didn't hear anything.

601
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,080
And yet, it's certain that the killer
entered in those three or four minutes.

602
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,050
The ones we've determined
from when you left the house...

603
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,990
...until the moment that
the dog smelled the body.

604
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,640
Tell me...

605
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:10,020
...can you assure me the lady was alone,
when you were called to the apartment?

606
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,409
No... I'm not sure.

607
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,540
Well, yes, she was alone.

608
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,360
Does she have many visitors?
- No.

609
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,560
Only the gentleman visited.

610
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,850
Has she spoken of anyone
with the initials F.O.?

611
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,700
Never.

612
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,370
And you don't recall her receiving any
letters from someone with those initials?

613
00:40:32,405 --> 00:40:34,510
No, no.
- And when she says no...

614
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,490
...she means no,
she spends her day snooping.

615
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,845
Cleaning up that
disgusting dog's messes.

616
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,135
What, my dog disgusting?
- Yes, it is!

617
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,050
Disgusting and filthy!
- I can't take this!

618
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,590
That's enough!

619
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,250
You can go now.

620
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,540
If I need you I'll call on you.
- Yes, sir.

621
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,000
Thank you.

622
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:00,370
Mr. Inspector, you should know that
I'm happy to help whenever you need.

623
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:03,530
But the next time,
try to see that it's me alone.

624
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,150
Oh, you'd like that!

625
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,670
How indecent!

626
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:10,459
You're ridiculous!
- Hussy!

627
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,060
Go take care of
the little dog!

628
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,650
At what time did you tend
to see your fiancée?

629
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,229
At 1, every day.

630
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,529
Was she always on time?

631
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,599
Recently, no.

632
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,660
Sometimes the bus was late,
sometimes with work...

633
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,680
She said men could always wait,
have a smoke or read.

634
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,190
And that's what I did.

635
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,759
Oh, Destino!

636
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,000
They sometimes publish really
good articles about the circus.

637
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,149
Here you are.

638
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,650
The circus
behind the scenes.

639
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:58,050
This Sebastian Gas,
he's a great storyteller.

640
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,540
Did you read it
while having a drink?

641
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,920
No, I bought it
when I left the bar.

642
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,470
I told you that already.

643
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:06,280
Oh, yes. That's right.

644
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,579
Here are the witnesses.

645
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,080
Let them in.

646
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,780
Have a seat.

647
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,300
Do you know this man?

648
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,420
Almost every day
he comes into my cafe.

649
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,030
Was he there today?
- Yes, sir.

650
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:18,889
When did he leave?

651
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:20,390
Around 1:15.

652
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,950
Was he reading
this magazine?

653
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,140
No, it was a book.
A short novel.

654
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,810
He had the magazine
in his pocket.

655
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,179
That's not right.
It was another one.

656
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,970
I thought you bought it
when you left the cafe.

657
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,730
This woman can tell
you when I bought it.

658
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,780
Do you recall?
- I think so.

659
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,020
This very man gave me
a bill for 100.

660
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,880
And when I told him
I didn't have change...

661
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:41,910
...he looked in his pockets
and found a smaller one.

662
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,960
At what time did
this man buy Destino?

663
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,679
At 1:15.

664
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,500
He asked me for the time.

665
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,849
And he bought this?

666
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:50,519
Yes.

667
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,020
The last one.

668
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,230
Did you notice if the man
went back into the bar?

669
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,070
He went toward the corner
of Zurbaran Street.

670
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,670
I saw him walk
around there.

671
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,740
He told me he was
waiting for his girlfriend.

672
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,290
It seems he told
everyone in the world?

673
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:07,870
That's not normal?

674
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,390
How long was he waiting?

675
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,300
I'm not sure,
when I noticed him...

676
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,890
...I saw him walking with
a middle-aged woman.

677
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:20,980
And up to that point, you didn't
see if he had left the corner?

678
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,970
I'm not sure, you see...

679
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,650
...I had my work...
- Thank you, you can go.

680
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:29,850
Good afternoon.

681
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,449
You just heard what
this woman says she saw,

682
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,060
If you bought Destino
after you left the cafe,

683
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,980
you couldn't have had it in your
pocket when you were there.

684
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,880
Well I would say
it was that exact one.

685
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,950
I already said so
in the bar, remember?

686
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,140
Explain how he's wrong,
what magazine is this?

687
00:43:41,175 --> 00:43:42,479
It was last week's Destino.

688
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,250
I left it in the boarding house.
You can find it there.

689
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,220
Don't bother.

690
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,800
You can go.

691
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,400
Good afternoon.

692
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:02,530
It's strange that you hadn't read
last week's issue until today.

693
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,070
From what you said, your
fiancée always arrived late.

694
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,360
That doesn't mean I always
have to read one specific magazine.

695
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,570
Could I see the apartment key?

696
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,049
Here it is.

697
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,690
And the other one?

698
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,450
There's no other lock.
- I mean the key to the patio.

699
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,309
I've never had it. Why?

700
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:31,720
It's easier to go in
through the front door.

701
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,220
How long would it take to go from
Zurbaran Street to your fiancee's house?

702
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,540
Well... maybe 10 minutes.

703
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,180
That's what it took you
and the housekeeper?

704
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,160
Yes, something like that.

705
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,050
Of course, if you didn't have
to slow down to her pace...

706
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,580
...you'd have arrived
sooner, right?

707
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:53,130
Maybe 7 or 8 minutes,
right?

708
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,550
Answer me!
- I'm not sure.

709
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,029
I'm getting confused
with these questions!

710
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,640
You seem to suspect me!

711
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,610
Until I find the killer,
I'm going to suspect everyone!

712
00:45:03,645 --> 00:45:06,350
The other witnesses left calmly.

713
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,310
Unlike them, I've been
here for two hours.

714
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,960
I'm tired!
- Me too.

715
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,670
But we still need to go on.

716
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:15,810
Who knows if something
has been left out?

717
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:20,140
Maybe some little clue
will tell us everything.

718
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,030
Consider that.

719
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,560
Ok. You can continue.

720
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,600
Good policemen
know jiu-jitsu.

721
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,080
One day, my dad put a
robber in a hold like this...

722
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,510
...and the guy had no choice
but to drop his gun.

723
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,880
Even the police chief
congratulated him.

724
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,380
Yeah, you believe everything!
He'll tell you whatever.

725
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:45,910
Your dad's probably the same.

726
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,355
You jerk, you wish you had
a dad like mine.

727
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:51,550
He's made it because of who he knows.
- You'll regret that!

728
00:45:51,585 --> 00:45:54,200
Let him go, his dad's fine...!
- Go on...!

729
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,020
Go on!
Get out of here!

730
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:00,110
Don't pay attention to him!

731
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,860
How does your dad
find criminals?

732
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,540
How? With clues.

733
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,729
What are clues?

734
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,870
Right, like you don't know.

735
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,200
If you find a dead guy
there are clues to who killed him.

736
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,620
How funny! He might have
died by falling down somewhere.

737
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,450
And if there's a knife in his chest,
he did that by falling down too?

738
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:23,239
Think about it...

739
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,950
If the knife is from Albacete,
that's a clue.

740
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,209
Right!

741
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:28,930
Anything around the victim
could be one.

742
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:32,090
And if you found a playing card...
Who did it?

743
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,860
A card player!
- Right!

744
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,260
And if you found a receipt
in the guy's jacket?

745
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,509
They killed him because
he couldn't pay up.

746
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:38,699
Now do you get it?

747
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,200
We'll see.

748
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,180
If you found a glass eye,
what then?

749
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:43,930
The killer only had one eye.

750
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,190
Of course, dummy.
You still don't get it?

751
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:50,600
All this about clues is harder
than finding the criminal.

752
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,710
I don't remember anything else.
I've explained everything.

753
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,570
Fine.

754
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,550
Do you want a drink?
- I'd like to leave, Inspector.

755
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,040
Look, I need to clear
my head for a bit.

756
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:06,580
That's why I invited you.

757
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,260
We can go like two friends,
grabbing a drink.

758
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,019
Do you want to?

759
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,520
I think I need to.

760
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,600
You've had me here
talking for two hours.

761
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,800
To sell a car, you'd
have to do the same.

762
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,319
It must be a
tough job, right?

763
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,709
I can't complain.

764
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:31,900
I'm more independent now,
since I have friends all around.

765
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,680
We're talking, very important people

766
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,290
I believe you.

767
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:47,870
Good afternoon, Inspector.

768
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,660
The regular, two glasses of Jerez?
- Yes. Or do you want something else?

769
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,260
No, thank you, that's fine.

770
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,610
Did you see many
clients today?

771
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:00,470
Two.

772
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,180
I can prove it to you
if you don't believe me.

773
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,280
Why shouldn't I
believe you?

774
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:07,010
I wonder the same thing.

775
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,540
I'll trade you this die
for the magazine.

776
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,800
Throw in the pen
and it's done.

777
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:18,100
Goal! 8 a 0.
You can't keep up!

778
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,560
Well, he distracted me!
- Distracted! Excuses!

779
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,029
The problem is, you don't
know how to play.

780
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,470
Come on! Stop messing
with little kids.

781
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,500
Hi, dad.
- What are you doing here?

782
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,740
I've told you before, I don't
want to see you in bars.

783
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,140
I didn't think
you'd be here...

784
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:41,900
Some excuse.
You'll end up in juvenile hall.

785
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:44,360
Go home right now.
Your mother was worried.

786
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:48,069
Well, I had to trade some comics
with Antonio,

787
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:51,250
I want to read something
and no wasting money.

788
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,130
One dime for allowance
doesn't pay for much.

789
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,400
You'd be a good businessman.
- I'd rather be a policeman, like my dad.

790
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,020
He's one too?
- If we were all cops...

791
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,180
...who'd go to jail?

792
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,100
Didn't you hear me, Pedro.
Go home now!

793
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:10,200
It's normal for him to talk
to you about all that.

794
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,940
It's not worth it.
When my dad's like this...

795
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,480
...it's pointless arguing.

796
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,370
Ok, dad, I'm going.

797
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,660
Bye, sir.
- Bye.

798
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:25,170
You're strict even with
your son, Inspector.

799
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,600
When I have to be, yes.

800
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:29,370
Better now than later.

801
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:40,120
Hey! Did you know this
glass eye could be a clue?

802
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,880
You said it
wasn't one earlier.

803
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,610
But look, it's new!

804
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,059
Maybe it got lost?

805
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,199
Don't be a fool.

806
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,820
How's someone going to
lose it without realizing?

807
00:49:52,110 --> 00:49:54,180
They'd take it out
sometime, right?

808
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:55,960
At night, anyway.

809
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,670
You ever seen someone take one
out in the middle of the street?

810
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:00,230
But it could fall out.

811
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,760
Let me see it!

812
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,149
You see?

813
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:07,220
But they'd know,
and anyway...

814
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,410
...if it fell it
would break.

815
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:11,490
It's a miracle
you haven't broken it.

816
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:17,380
Where'd you find it?
- Miguelin gave it to me this morning...

817
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:19,240
...when I looked for you
at the cleaners.

818
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:23,070
He's an idiot. He traded it
for a pencil with two colors.

819
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,170
Do you know if you'll
be at school tomorrow?

820
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:28,830
If your dad keeps it up,
we won't see you for a month.

821
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,779
We'll go see him now.

822
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,380
Why? I'd rather
play in the plaza.

823
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,150
Of course, if you give me
the pen, I'll go with you.

824
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,880
Leave it! I don't need you.
I know where Mr. Clean lives.

825
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,860
Yeah, you know where he lives,
and he'll give you a beating.

826
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,470
But I know where Miguelin
is playing right now.

827
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,110
See you later!

828
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:52,290
Antonio!

829
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,480
Take it!

830
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:58,930
It will help you with
some math problem.

831
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,745
These are the prints
we found in the patio...

832
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:08,210
...and they match the ones
found next to the victim.

833
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,380
So the killer entered
from the patio?

834
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,499
That's right.

835
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,460
Then the housekeeper
would have seen him.

836
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,580
The glass door was closed
when we found the body.

837
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,290
This means the victim
and killer knew each other.

838
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,280
She wouldn't have given keys
to someone she didn't know.

839
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:30,530
Couldn't he have entered an open door
and used her key to lock it behind him?

840
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,150
No.
The key is here.

841
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,540
On the key chain
from her purse.

842
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:37,130
Some puzzle.

843
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:40,050
The case gets more
difficult by the minute.

844
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:44,480
The witnesses all claim
that only the fiancé went in.

845
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,950
And now it seems there's
some other guy in between.

846
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:49,050
Everyone trusts a woman.

847
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,740
It's not a crime of passion.

848
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:52,679
And why not?

849
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,430
The girl was cute.

850
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:58,380
One day she meets a guy,
and he falls for her.

851
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:02,740
They go out, act silly...
and then he sees there's a fiancé.

852
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:04,610
The one who pays the rent.

853
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,740
Who comes in like a gentleman,
through the front door.

854
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:10,650
He gets pissed off!
They talk, he wants her to be just his...

855
00:52:10,685 --> 00:52:12,245
Yes, and in view of that...

856
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,080
...the girl asks the housekeeper
to bring the fiancé around to face him,

857
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:18,300
like in a Medieval tournament.

858
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:22,360
No, no woman would do that,
because then they'd both be gone.

859
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:24,770
No, I'm sure the
secret is here.

860
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:27,800
She forged, or tried
to forge a signature.

861
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:29,139
It couldn't have been
someone else?

862
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,640
And they put the paper
in her bag? -No.

863
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,420
You're forgetting that it's the
same ink as in her pen.

864
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,080
Does it seem like
they made a mistake?

865
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:38,949
Look at this.

866
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,319
According to the
graphologists...

867
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,150
...it's the same handwriting
found in her notebook.

868
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,360
And she put the paper in her bag
because it seemed safer than the trash.

869
00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:48,890
Exactly!

870
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:51,160
F.O.

871
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,160
If we only knew
the whole name.

872
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:59,900
We can check at the
company where she worked.

873
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,239
Great idea!

874
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,850
You've got to give it back.
My dad's going crazy about it...

875
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,459
...I don't want him
to stay upset.

876
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,530
I can't give it back.
I don't have it now.

877
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:09,940
I traded for it.
It's mine now.

878
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,710
Well, give it to me.
I need it.

879
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:12,799
I'll give you anything.

880
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,750
Why does your dad
want it? Is it his?

881
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:16,640
It was in some pants
that were brought in today.

882
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,560
I found it. But my dad
found out. Get it?

883
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:21,240
And the customer
wants it back...

884
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,810
What pocket was it in?
- It wasn't in a pocket.

885
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,650
It was here,
in the cuff.

886
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,200
Weird place to keep it.

887
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,010
That's really weird.

888
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:33,140
Once my father found
a coin in a pair of pants.

889
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:35,380
It happens all the time.
You take something...

890
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,209
...it falls down here...

891
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:38,980
...it ends up in the back...

892
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:42,640
...and it stays there unless
you have shake them out.

893
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,360
I see.

894
00:53:44,395 --> 00:53:45,860
So...

895
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,220
The guy didn't know
he had it in there.

896
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,820
Did you see if he was
missing an eye? -No.

897
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,890
Was he wearing glasses?
- No.

898
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,389
Man! That's a clue!

899
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:59,890
Exactly, a clue!

900
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,479
What does that mean?
- Look.

901
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,420
Wait! Tell us tomorrow.

902
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,120
Say, when do you take
the pants to that guy?

903
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,670
It's a full suit
and he's picking it up.

904
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,300
So, he didn't leave
his information?

905
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,870
What for?
He wants to pick it up.

906
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:14,610
And when will he go?
- Tonight, but...

907
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,810
...well,
will you give me the eye?

908
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:19,200
First I want to see the suit.

909
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,810
Did you see if it
had a blood stain?

910
00:54:23,330 --> 00:54:25,200
No. It was
covered in mud.

911
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,699
Let me see it,
would you?

912
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,700
You've never seen
a dirty suit before?

913
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,210
It's yours if you take
me to your house.

914
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,340
What is?
- Don't you see, dummy?

915
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,900
A button from
an admiral's uniform.

916
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:43,080
Ok, let's go,
but be careful...

917
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:45,680
...if my dad sees us,
we'll be in for it.

918
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,250
He's got some temper!
- Just today?

919
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,420
Come on, let's go.

920
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,579
F.O.

921
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,080
Those initials...?

922
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,000
I don't know,
reminds me of something.

923
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:02,160
Of course, so many things
go on around here.

924
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,060
Best to do what you wanted.
Look in the archive.

925
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,340
But still, why do you think
she would leave that here?

926
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,200
She could have done so.
We'll have to investigate further.

927
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,300
I see.

928
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,470
Get the archivist up here!

929
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:23,590
He'll help you.
- Thank you.

930
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,030
Follow up on this, and if you find
what we need, call me at the station.

931
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,750
Yes, sir.
- An important job.

932
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:31,870
You'll earn a couple
of medals at least.

933
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:34,240
May I?

934
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,430
Take these men to the archive
and help them out, please.

935
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,960
They need to find a signature.
- Yes, sir.

936
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,120
Let's go.

937
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,370
You'll have to excuse us,
but these things...

938
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:48,590
May I?
- Come in.

939
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,200
Julia, these men would like
to ask you some questions.

940
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,579
Thank you.

941
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,019
Let's see.

942
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,770
Do you remember if Miss Clara
received a call from her fiancé today?

943
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,680
Yes, sir.
- Have a seat.

944
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:05,880
At what time was it?
- I'm not sure. A bit before 12.

945
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,699
Did you hear
the conversation?

946
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,089
No, sir.
- Are you sure?

947
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:10,590
I'm sure.

948
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,210
Did they talk a long time?
- No, not long at all.

949
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,710
She hung up on him.

950
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,400
I'm not accustomed
to listening in on calls.

951
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,400
But when the director
wants to talk to an employee...

952
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:22,530
...I have to interrupt sometimes,
even in the middle of the conversation.

953
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:25,130
When I connected
her to the call...

954
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,230
...I heard her say
"this is not a good time to talk. "

955
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:30,020
And she hung up.
- Ok.

956
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,530
And he called
again later, right?

957
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:35,650
I'm not sure. If he did
he didn't say he was her fiancé.

958
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:37,910
Thank you, that's all.

959
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,830
Tomorrow at 9
please come to the station.

960
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:45,910
Sorry to bother you.
- It's no trouble.

961
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:50,600
Have Enrique and the waiter
come in at the same time.

962
00:56:50,635 --> 00:56:52,100
Yes, sir.

963
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:03,270
Don't make any noise.

964
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,640
You seem like a detective
taking so many precautions.

965
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:15,390
Just like him. But his
dad's a policeman.

966
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,030
It's better to be
an admiral.

967
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:19,960
But first you have to be
a sailor, and peel potatoes.

968
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:23,290
His dad once caught
a whole group of robbers.

969
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,339
Woah! Just him?

970
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:27,200
Sure! My dad's the best
policeman in the world.

971
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:32,890
There it is.
It's about to be pressed.

972
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,970
Are you sure it
didn't have blood stains?

973
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,590
Yes! I already told you
it was covered with mud.

974
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:40,660
You saw this guy, right?

975
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:42,729
And did he
seem suspicious?

976
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:45,830
Why should he have?
Guys come every day with suits.

977
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,890
A bit ugly, maybe...

978
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,480
...but so is my dad,
and everyone trusts him.

979
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,390
Your dad is a trusted businessman,
even if he has a bad temper.

980
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:56,960
Just a bad temper?
He's an ogre.

981
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,659
Who's there?

982
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:00,210
What are you little
roaches doing here?

983
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,810
Run, he's going
to kill us!

984
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:04,530
Get out!
- Hey, you have no right to hit me!

985
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:05,909
What? Damn it!

986
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:07,630
Miguelin, come here!

987
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:09,680
Miguelin!

988
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:11,870
Miguelin!

989
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,960
He recognized us.
- You're in for it when you go home.

990
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,260
I can't go back because of you, Pedro.
Would you at least give me the glass eye?

991
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:25,230
Why not tell your dad
that you lost it?

992
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,580
Sure, so he'll just
hit me harder! Right!

993
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:30,335
Give it to me now!
It's mine!

994
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:34,840
Don't be like that. I was going
to give you this collection of cards.

995
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,980
All of them?
- If you help me, yes.

996
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,810
Alright. And what
do I have to do?

997
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,220
Tell us when the guy
comes to get the suit.

998
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:42,750
Ok.

999
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:45,580
But if I get in trouble because of you,
I'm never going to see you again.

1000
00:58:45,630 --> 00:58:48,870
Don't be a coward. You'll see it's
like a game, and you'll have fun.

1001
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,520
I'd rather play sailors.
I'll whistle when he comes.

1002
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,740
But if he asks for the eye,
promise you'll give it to me.

1003
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,970
Ok, I will.
But go on now.

1004
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,540
Who is it?

1005
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,440
May I?

1006
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,899
Oh, it's you?

1007
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:21,070
Just like a cop.
- Not so friendly, huh?

1008
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:25,580
But the Inspector has a
special desire to chat with you.

1009
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,910
It's a nice little spot.

1010
00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:36,920
And don't say you
were dozing off.

1011
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:43,250
Oh, yeah, the Inspector wants to
see you tomorrow at 9 sharp.

1012
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,330
And think,
he's your friend.

1013
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:53,550
And so am I, and together,
we're just worried about one thing.

1014
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,140
A murder.

1015
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:05,890
It's late. Maybe
he's not coming?

1016
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:09,560
The shop closes at 8.
- We're waiting til then? I'm bored.

1017
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:11,139
Let's go!

1018
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,800
You're like a little kid.
A policeman has to be patient...

1019
01:00:13,835 --> 01:00:15,199
...and wait for
the right moment.

1020
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,000
My dad always
says that.

1021
01:00:17,290 --> 01:00:19,040
It's that my parents
are waiting for me.

1022
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:21,749
I've got an idea.

1023
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,560
I'll go eat dinner, make
up something, and come back here.

1024
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:26,460
Then you can go eat.

1025
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:29,960
So I'll wait here alone?
- What, are you scared?

1026
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:32,870
That figures.
- Me scared? Not a bit.

1027
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,890
And if the guy comes
while you're gone?

1028
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:37,850
Follow him,
remember where he goes...

1029
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:39,900
...then come back
and tell me.

1030
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:42,480
And remember to keep
your eyes and ears open.

1031
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,020
Listen!
- That's it!

1032
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:09,030
Hi, mom.
- Hi.

1033
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,740
Is dinner ready?

1034
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:15,570
Why in such a hurry?
- Tomorrow there's a test.

1035
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,079
It's going to be
a tough one.

1036
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:20,360
And we agreed to go to
Miguelin's house to study.

1037
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,699
Why don't they come here?

1038
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,500
Antonio would, but Miguelin's
father won't let him leave the shop.

1039
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:28,670
And he's a big grouch.
- That's why I don't want you going.

1040
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:33,470
Oh, he's an ok guy!
He likes me.

1041
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,500
I'm coming!

1042
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,619
What is it?

1043
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:32,930
Oh, it's you!
I was about to close.

1044
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:35,100
Come on in. You won't
recognize the suit.

1045
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:39,699
Don't be late, Pedro.

1046
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:41,690
I don't like you being
out so late.

1047
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,230
Don't worry, mom.

1048
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,650
I've got to study a lot.
I don't want to get bad grades.

1049
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,480
What? I hardly recognize you!

1050
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,080
Bye, mom!

1051
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,660
Where were you guys?
The guy already left.

1052
01:04:12,695 --> 01:04:14,425
He went that way.
- And Antonio?

1053
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,130
What do I know.
Go on, he's going to get away!

1054
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:29,580
There he goes!
Are you coming?

1055
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,779
And Antonio?

1056
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:33,310
He's not coming back!
He's chicken.

1057
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:36,030
It's just that...
My dad will be looking for me.

1058
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:38,910
You want to be a
police assistant?

1059
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:42,780
I want to be a sailor.
- You can be both.

1060
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:44,930
I name you
my assistant.

1061
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:47,110
You'll see,
it will be fun.

1062
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,849
What?

1063
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:45,700
He couldn't have
crossed the plaza.

1064
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:47,529
And he's not in the bar.

1065
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:49,770
We can go now.
- I'm sure he went in here.

1066
01:05:49,805 --> 01:05:51,280
Whatever! Who knows
where he went?

1067
01:05:51,315 --> 01:05:52,780
Come on, lets' go.

1068
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:02,590
Come here!

1069
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:10,660
Don't look right at him! Put your
head down, like we're playing.

1070
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:18,880
Stop it!
You're hurting me!

1071
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,620
He already left!
- Yeah right! He's spying on us!

1072
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,160
No he's not, look!

1073
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,080
We're not going?

1074
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,330
Don't think I'm scared.
You know sailors are brave...

1075
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:30,855
...but I don't like this.

1076
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:32,870
That guy might really
be a killer.

1077
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:34,400
If only he were!

1078
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:38,520
I'd tell my dad
and he'd catch him.

1079
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:42,240
Then the chief would
have to recognize...

1080
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,520
...that he's the best
policeman in the city.

1081
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:47,730
I want to help him.
He was worried today.

1082
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,600
Ok, but that's on you.
I'm leaving.

1083
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:51,410
We can't go!

1084
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,620
If he's a killer, he wouldn't
be able to sleep, and would leave again.

1085
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,810
Their conscience eats at them,

1086
01:06:56,850 --> 01:07:01,440
and at night, the person they killed
finds them and grabs at their feet.

1087
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,670
Wait a minute!

1088
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:06,759
We'll do this...

1089
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,110
Go eat dinner,
then come back here.

1090
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,850
My dad won't
let me leave.

1091
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:14,690
Tell him that since you weren't at school,
you came to my place to study.

1092
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,740
That's the best plan.
- You think?

1093
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,880
But don't bring
your wallet here!

1094
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,190
The umbrella stand is
the best place to hide it.

1095
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:22,850
We don't have one
in my house.

1096
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:25,330
Then hide it under the bed!
Go on now!

1097
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:27,090
Well go on!

1098
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:33,840
This thing about studying
seems like a trick.

1099
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:36,130
That's why I'm asking
if he really came here.

1100
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,319
Little scamps!

1101
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,450
Believe me, I've had
it up to here with them!

1102
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:41,980
Where could they have gone?
It's almost 9!

1103
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:44,945
I imagine at the movies,
or playing football.

1104
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,850
And me working here like
a prisoner since 8 in the morning!

1105
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,430
He'll learn to obey
his fater!

1106
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,089
There they are.

1107
01:07:54,090 --> 01:07:56,050
Oh, thank God,
I was so worried.

1108
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:57,980
Now he'll learn a lesson.

1109
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:08,880
Where were you?
- At... at Pedro's house...

1110
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,520
We have a test tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

1111
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:13,290
Well, tomorrow or Friday.

1112
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:17,170
But we've been
studying a lot.

1113
01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:19,230
Oh, really?

1114
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,609
And with Pedro, right?

1115
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:23,030
Sure, dad, and we
still have to study more.

1116
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:25,340
You already know I don't
care if you learn math.

1117
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:27,930
Why not? I'll be an engineer.

1118
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:31,300
From a line of cleaners
but with a degree.

1119
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:34,810
So I'm going to eat dinner
and then head out again.

1120
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:39,050
I can't be late.
- Fine, then, come in...

1121
01:08:39,630 --> 01:08:42,770
...I'll get you your dinner.
- Thanks, dad.

1122
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:44,510
Come in!

1123
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:52,119
And now will you
tell me where you were?

1124
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,620
Where is Pedro?

1125
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:55,450
Answer!

1126
01:08:57,060 --> 01:08:58,820
He's waiting for a man.
- For a man?

1127
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:00,930
And who is this man?
- It's a game.

1128
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,720
Pedro wanted to follow him.
- This is the height of stupidity.

1129
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,640
And you've been following
him all night?

1130
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:07,730
What type of game is this?

1131
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,850
I don't know.
It was Pedro's idea.

1132
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:11,079
Go on!

1133
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,190
Then he said the guy
might be a criminal.

1134
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,715
That's why he wants to know
where the guy lives.

1135
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:17,860
Why didn't he come with you?
- He's waiting for the guy to leave.

1136
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:20,210
He says dead people will
string him by his toes.

1137
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:23,320
I was scared, but he wouldn't
let me go. -But where is he?

1138
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:25,640
Well...
- Answer at once!

1139
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:29,990
In Berenguer Plaza. Pedro wants to
follow him to see if he's a killer...

1140
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,520
...so his dad
can catch him.

1141
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,740
He's a really,
really weird guy...

1142
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,515
...like he's scared
of being caught.

1143
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:37,260
I'll go look for him.
- He'll go!

1144
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,479
Hurry!

1145
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,220
If you're late, I'm sending
you to juvenile hall!

1146
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:42,200
But you'll go in crippled!
Remember that!

1147
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:44,890
Can I use the phone?
- It's right there.

1148
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:49,040
I mean... it's that...
I just... can't...!

1149
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,030
All these little...!

1150
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,280
What a life.

1151
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:58,840
Yes.

1152
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,449
No, he's not here.

1153
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,640
Your husband is meeting
with the chief.

1154
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:05,130
Yes, just a moment.
Wait.

1155
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:06,830
Here he comes.

1156
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,210
This time he
was very clear.

1157
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:15,250
I have until Thursday
to figure this out.

1158
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:19,080
Then another Inspector takes over.
- Your wife.

1159
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:22,040
Tell her I'm out.
- Come on!

1160
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:24,419
What is it?

1161
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,570
This is a bad time.
If it's about dinner...

1162
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,710
...don't wait up for me.
I'm sure I'll be late.

1163
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:31,730
You can tell me later,
I can't focus now.

1164
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,260
Please understand!

1165
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:36,630
Sorry, dear.

1166
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,010
I'm nervous,
and I can't think straight.

1167
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,800
What is it?
- Nothing, just to talk to you.

1168
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,690
Don't worry about me.
If you're late I'll head to bed.

1169
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:50,290
There will be a bottle
of milk in the refrigerator.

1170
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:52,610
Oh, and remember
what you promised.

1171
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,390
Don't think about the chief.

1172
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:59,180
Turn your back to his window,
and everything will turn out in the end.

1173
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,010
Until Thursday?
You'll be done by then.

1174
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:06,150
Just think of yourself, dear.

1175
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,300
Well, in me too
if you have time.

1176
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:11,030
Bye.

1177
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:13,600
Didnt' tell him, huh?

1178
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:18,360
He's got enough worries.
- I'm the most wretched man in the world.

1179
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,460
Why?
- My wife.

1180
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:24,590
She'd burst if she
couldn't let off steam!

1181
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:28,650
Give me some news.
The worse it is, the better!

1182
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:31,280
Well, I'm going
to Berenguer Plaza.

1183
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:34,470
I'll be worried
otherwise. Goodbye.

1184
01:11:36,670 --> 01:11:38,370
LAYETANA BOARDING HOUSE

1185
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:18,470
It's just me.

1186
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:19,839
There he is.

1187
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,990
Your mom's at my house
and they know everything.

1188
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:23,640
I've come to find you.
They're waiting.

1189
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:26,000
I've got to follow him,
I told you.

1190
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:27,570
I want to help my dad.

1191
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:34,340
You think he saw us?

1192
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:36,280
Look!

1193
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,900
It's like he's scared
he's being followed.

1194
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:40,760
That's normal.

1195
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:46,320
Let's go!

1196
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,380
Oh, hi! Tell me!
- We've found four bills...

1197
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,619
...with the initials F.O.

1198
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,340
But the signatures
don't match the other one.

1199
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,020
Yes, I've looked carefully.

1200
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:06,040
There's just one more to check,
from a Francisco Ortia.

1201
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:07,429
But it's not in
his folder.

1202
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,740
There's a note that it's
with the legal assessor.

1203
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:13,020
Don't leave until we talk
to that legal assessor.

1204
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:13,939
This is important.

1205
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,740
We've got to get
this done tonight.

1206
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,990
That F.O. has to be our man!

1207
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,610
The one who will lead us to the end!
- That's how I like seeing you.

1208
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:26,890
But you should take
the time to have some dinner.

1209
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,120
When you get back
you'll think more clearly.

1210
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:30,539
You're right.

1211
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:31,809
I'm tired of smoking.

1212
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:34,280
If he calls before I'm back,
call me at my house.

1213
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:36,110
See you later.
- Bye.

1214
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:03,439
Wait.

1215
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,940
He saw us, don't go on.
You might get hurt.

1216
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,050
A policeman isn't afraid.
- Or a sailor!

1217
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,640
But I don't like this.

1218
01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:15,049
I don't trust that guy.

1219
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,550
Listen to me.

1220
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:19,340
Maybe he'll kill us.
- Enough with that!

1221
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,550
Listen.
- Stop, we've got to play it cool.

1222
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:46,110
What?
- I'm sure of it.

1223
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:48,840
He was at the bar with
my dad earlier today.

1224
01:14:49,350 --> 01:14:51,150
And he said he wasn't a cop.

1225
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,750
So my dad wanted
something from him.

1226
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:55,770
He must suspect him.

1227
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:57,249
Did you see?

1228
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,110
He's got a criminal's face...

1229
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:01,190
Let's go!
- Wait.

1230
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:04,540
If we find out something important,
my dad will be happy.

1231
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:07,720
We should try.
- You try, I'm going.

1232
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,540
Ok, then go.

1233
01:15:09,575 --> 01:15:11,040
Go on!

1234
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:41,760
He wasn't in the plaza, and
I looked around but didn't see him.

1235
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,219
And look at the time.

1236
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:44,720
Could something have
happened to him?

1237
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:47,370
What would happen?
He's a little hoodlum.

1238
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,950
Sure, if you never discipline him,
he'll just laugh at everything!

1239
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:51,970
You have to be
stern with him.

1240
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,380
Ok, I will.

1241
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,819
Tomorrow I'll talk to him.

1242
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:58,110
Don't worry.
I promise you.

1243
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,259
Yes?

1244
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:04,219
Finally!

1245
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,699
Is it him?

1246
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,989
Give me the information.

1247
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:08,179
He's the one, Inspector.

1248
01:16:08,180 --> 01:16:10,410
The signature
matches up completely.

1249
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:14,890
This Francisco Ortia guy lost
an eye in an accident...

1250
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,590
that he says was the
fault of the company.

1251
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:18,300
He came and signed
the resignation letter.

1252
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,840
And by pulling at
their heartstrings...

1253
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:23,380
...and in light of certain considerations,
the company gave him 50,000 pesetas.

1254
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:25,960
That was two or
three days ago.

1255
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:30,100
And I just learned that today
they sent a check in his name.

1256
01:16:30,130 --> 01:16:31,730
Poor guy!

1257
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:34,450
Listen. Go to the
station and wait for me.

1258
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,090
And give me
the guy's address.

1259
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,660
Hill Street, number 215.

1260
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:43,070
He works as watchman
on an abandoned factory.

1261
01:17:35,471 --> 01:17:38,971
HILL STREET

1262
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,610
I'm a policeman,
I can't be scared.

1263
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:42,130
Here he is!

1264
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:48,209
You didn't find him?

1265
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:50,490
Not find him?
Tell them!

1266
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:53,700
Tell them! About the
persecution of a saint!

1267
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:55,860
A saint, yes sir!

1268
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:59,770
And this all happened because your son
said that you suspected him.

1269
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:01,310
Go on, then!

1270
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,380
Hurry, or I'll tear off your ear!

1271
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:06,870
Let him go.
- Damned kids.

1272
01:23:07,610 --> 01:23:09,510
Enough!

1273
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:12,340
It's alright, son.

1274
01:23:12,450 --> 01:23:14,150
You've got to tell me everything.

1275
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,070
Let go! Let me go!

1276
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:21,219
Quiet! Shut up
right now!

1277
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,319
Did you go into? the basement?
- No.

1278
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,640
You'll go down there now.
And you'll have company.

1279
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,410
You don't scare me,
my dad will find you out.

1280
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:29,780
Your dad.
So he sent you, huh?

1281
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:32,900
Let me go!
Let me go!

1282
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:38,510
Let me go! Let me go!

1283
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:42,820
Damn it!
Don't be a fool!

1284
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,459
There's no escape.

1285
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:46,740
This is the only exit.
There's no other way out.

1286
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:54,350
Remember, Agent Perez from the
Criminal Brigade, Group 2.

1287
01:23:54,385 --> 01:23:55,850
It's urgent.
- Yes, sir.

1288
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:23,190
Don't be a fool.
Even if I have to wait til dawn,

1289
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,850
I'm going to get you.

1290
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:31,270
Let me go!

1291
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:41,320
Pedro!

1292
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:48,320
Pedro!

1293
01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:52,869
Pedro!

1294
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:54,370
Dad!

1295
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:01,590
Why not call him again?

1296
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,580
Go on. What are
you waiting for?

1297
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:07,250
Call him.

1298
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:15,830
Careful, dad!
There he is!

1299
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:37,900
Give it to him, dad!
He's a killer!

1300
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:19,160
Dad!

1301
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:46,879
Halt!

1302
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:48,560
Halt, or I'll shoot!

1303
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:50,960
Right now!

1304
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:52,559
Don't be crazy.

1305
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:54,080
Last chance!
Halt!

1306
01:26:54,950 --> 01:26:56,450
Halt!

1307
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,550
The check, just as I suspected.

1308
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:13,380
That was a good hunch
you had, Inspector.

1309
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:15,500
So that guy was all
wrapped up in it, huh?

1310
01:27:15,610 --> 01:27:17,110
Even more than we thought.

1311
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:19,160
He killed a man. The body's
in the basement, and I saw it.

1312
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,269
Calm down, son.

1313
01:27:20,270 --> 01:27:22,190
Now the chief will be
happy with you, right?

1314
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:24,150
You found the guy.
You've got to tell him.

1315
01:27:24,185 --> 01:27:25,650
He'll know, Pedro.

1316
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,540
This will go in his record,
as Special Services.

1317
01:27:28,575 --> 01:27:30,350
And everyone will
congratulate him, right?

1318
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:31,089
Of course.

1319
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:34,140
They've got to know that he's
the best policeman in the city.

1320
01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:36,400
Thanks, son. But you
put yourself in danger.

1321
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,380
Oh, I wasn't scared,

1322
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:39,759
you see how calm I am.

1323
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,660
Very ca...

1324
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:43,169
He's overcome with relief,

1325
01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:44,810
but this kid will
make a great cop.

1326
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:46,730
This time it's a hunch of mine.
