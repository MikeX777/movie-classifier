1
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:48,845
Look carefully!

2
00:00:49,045 --> 00:00:51,401
Fried eggs are
just like the cinema.

3
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:54,404
I break the egg
and something appears.

4
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,756
And then it changes.

5
00:00:57,045 --> 00:00:58,764
But the main thing is...

6
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:02,800
to make something appear
at the right speed.

7
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:04,965
Lovely, isn't it?

8
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,437
And listen to the sound,

9
00:01:09,325 --> 00:01:11,635
the fat sizzling in the pan.

10
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:14,445
Marvellous, eh?

11
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:19,565
Just like two eyes.

12
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:22,516
Two eyes looking at you.

13
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:25,316
"Mirror-eggs" in French.

14
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:30,322
They're very erotic, too.

15
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:34,564
Like two breasts.

16
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:37,317
No. Eroticism...

17
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:40,322
is not only
about pretty women.

18
00:01:40,445 --> 00:01:43,358
Films are always
related to eroticism.

19
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,562
They're of its very essence.

20
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:49,401
And that's why, unconsciously,
you want to make them.

21
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:53,724
And, hidden
within this mechanism,

22
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:56,517
there's something...

23
00:01:57,085 --> 00:01:58,724
impalpable,

24
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:01,164
inexpressible,

25
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:04,599
that can constitute
a lifelong pursuit.

26
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:07,519
What is it?

27
00:02:08,725 --> 00:02:10,239
Is it the truth?

28
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:12,438
Perhaps.

29
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:17,162
But only a part of the truth,
a tiny part.

30
00:03:45,165 --> 00:03:47,282
Why do you want to leave now?

31
00:03:47,725 --> 00:03:50,763
Celebrations everywhere,
and Lila's expecting me.

32
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:53,834
And I've got a TV contract,

33
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:56,837
to cover the event.

34
00:03:58,245 --> 00:03:59,998
A century is 100 years,

35
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:03,121
and it's 99 years old tomorrow.

36
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:06,324
The real millenium change
is not tomorrow,

37
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,717
and we don't care anyway.

38
00:04:09,925 --> 00:04:14,363
Why do they want to make time
a business of hour glasses?

39
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:17,997
We turn the hour glass,

40
00:04:18,285 --> 00:04:20,880
change the year and
the millenium...

41
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,436
and think we have to
celebrate and be happy.

42
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,565
But time is...

43
00:04:31,285 --> 00:04:33,117
more complicated.

44
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:37,444
You can't get rid of it
so easily...

45
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:40,404
or shape it as you want.

46
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:44,961
It shapes us...

47
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:48,962
and devours us as well.

48
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,835
But forget it. Just
tell Maria your love story.

49
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:55,595
Oh, you like that, Anziano.

50
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:56,960
Yes,

51
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,605
it's surprising.

52
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:01,599
I'm all ears.

53
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:05,118
Nothing unusual,

54
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,198
except that I first met
Lila in nursery school.

55
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:10,119
We were 5 years old.

56
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:13,318
I loved her even then.

57
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:15,119
And she you?

58
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:17,114
Yes.

59
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:20,640
At 12 we went to
the same high school,

60
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:24,517
and swore eternal love
for one another.

61
00:05:31,645 --> 00:05:33,762
You're forgetting a detail.

62
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:36,754
What?

63
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,205
That she's black?

64
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:43,205
And she's very lovely.

65
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:45,965
And afterwards?

66
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:52,365
Later, we discovered
how to make love...

67
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:55,719
and then we married.

68
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:58,965
A bit later, that is.
Three years ago.

69
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:02,520
And it works?

70
00:06:02,925 --> 00:06:04,484
I'm sure it does.

71
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:06,085
Yes, it works.

72
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:09,518
Jonas, your story
is out of fashion.

73
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:12,039
Fashion?

74
00:06:17,365 --> 00:06:21,723
I'd only met Anziano once,
in Marseille, where he lived...

75
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:24,645
since giving up films
for writing.

76
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:29,285
Born in Trieste, he never
lost his love for ports and the sea.

77
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:32,481
His face appealed to me immediately.

78
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:36,520
I realised why Jonas
would visit him often.

79
00:06:36,845 --> 00:06:41,317
He'd met Anziano during
his studies at the film school.

80
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:54,598
I've a present for you.

81
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:13,799
What a marvel!

82
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:18,757
You're better here
than in town.

83
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:23,804
- Is it your home?
- No.

84
00:07:24,565 --> 00:07:28,559
It belongs to a painter friend
who's gone to Africa for 2 years.

85
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:30,922
He's lent me his house.

86
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:33,639
Not bad, is it?

87
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:35,285
No, not bad at all.

88
00:08:02,445 --> 00:08:05,324
It was on 31 December 1999.

89
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:09,444
Beautiful in the south,
but snowing in Geneva.

90
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:15,875
Jonas had managed, as usual,
to borrow a camera for his "diary".

91
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:21,239
Scenery filmed from the train
was the most beautiful thing in his mind.

92
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:29,480
In the evening, on arrival,
he left to film the celebrations.

93
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:33,235
I'd decided not to go.

94
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:38,159
Apart from the idiots who
believed in the end of the world,

95
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:42,837
I didn't want to celebrate a
pointless event amidst a hysterical mob.

96
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,999
I waited for Jonas
till 3 in the morning,

97
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:53,001
to celebrate the new century
in my own way.

98
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,242
The electicity hasn't failed.

99
00:10:23,885 --> 00:10:25,319
Nothing's changed,

100
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:27,563
not since the last century.

101
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,082
Go to bed, I must go now.

102
00:10:43,245 --> 00:10:45,476
Your gorillas can wait till tomorrow.

103
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:48,318
What difference does it make?

104
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:51,923
1st or 2nd January,
is all the same to them.

105
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:54,356
The year 2000 leaves them cold.

106
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:57,197
Of course it does,

107
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:03,918
but I'm meeting an actress
in the zoo at midday.

108
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,879
Why not just give her a ring?

109
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:15,199
I've no details.

110
00:11:15,605 --> 00:11:17,597
Neither telephone number nor address.

111
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,114
Nothing.

112
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:24,721
My friend Hans Peter arranged it,
and he's not at home.

113
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:27,281
He must be dead drunk somewhere,

114
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:29,124
like half of humanity.

115
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:34,557
Well, I'll sleep on the train.

116
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:36,199
Do you know the girl?

117
00:11:36,325 --> 00:11:38,317
No, only from a photograph.

118
00:11:38,805 --> 00:11:40,159
Is she pretty?

119
00:11:44,085 --> 00:11:46,600
Of course, Lilakins,
what d'you think?

120
00:12:55,205 --> 00:12:56,434
Good morning.

121
00:12:56,685 --> 00:12:58,165
Where are you off to?

122
00:12:58,325 --> 00:13:00,521
Zurich, to meet some gorillas.

123
00:13:00,725 --> 00:13:02,000
Is that so?

124
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:04,999
They'll have to wait.
No trains today.

125
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:08,204
- Why not?
- Central computer failure.

126
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:12,122
It didn't digest the first two
figures of the millenium.

127
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:15,279
- The millenium bug?
- That's it.

128
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:17,644
I don't believe it!

129
00:13:17,885 --> 00:13:19,205
I'm sorry.

130
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,796
Happy New Year, anyway.

131
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:23,760
Thanks.

132
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:27,438
Happy century!

133
00:13:27,605 --> 00:13:28,880
Thank you.

134
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,245
Damn it, that's a good start.

135
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:36,839
That means
300 km by car.

136
00:13:53,805 --> 00:13:55,205
Third question.

137
00:13:57,845 --> 00:13:59,040
We're rolling!

138
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:07,325
They say that it's our fault
that you're becoming extinct.

139
00:14:09,445 --> 00:14:12,802
But if you can hold on,
even in prison,

140
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:16,195
perhaps we'll go before you do.

141
00:14:18,885 --> 00:14:20,956
We're slowly moving that way.

142
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:24,523
Would you like that?

143
00:14:25,805 --> 00:14:27,364
Good. Very good.

144
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:28,954
Now, the last one.

145
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,396
We were fascinated by...

146
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:39,919
your freedom
in the primitive state.

147
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:43,720
We knew that this freedom was..

148
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:47,205
buried deeply within ourselves...

149
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:51,120
and strove to destroy it.

150
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,040
In other words,

151
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:55,683
to destroy you.

152
00:14:59,685 --> 00:15:02,439
The pity, hatred and fear...

153
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:05,280
that we bear towards you,

154
00:15:07,885 --> 00:15:10,161
we bear also towards ourselves.

155
00:15:16,085 --> 00:15:19,795
This world of exploitation
in which we live...

156
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:22,997
is now applied to you.

157
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:27,197
And I'm asking you,

158
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:30,436
on this first day of the new century:

159
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:36,641
What can you still do for us?

160
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:45,035
Not very much, I'm afraid.

161
00:15:47,525 --> 00:15:49,357
Did you see the way he looked?

162
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:52,197
Who knows...

163
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:55,481
Who knows...

164
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:13,754
Yes.

165
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,003
D'you want to ask anything?

166
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:19,724
- Me?
- Yes.

167
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:26,119
Yes, there is something
I'd like to ask them.

168
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:40,444
What's that?

169
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:44,324
Teach us patience.

170
00:16:48,445 --> 00:16:49,674
That's very good.

171
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:53,716
But who'll teach us impatience?

172
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:59,196
We need both
patience and impatience.

173
00:17:02,645 --> 00:17:04,125
I think that...

174
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:06,757
they can teach us patience.

175
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:12,682
Would you like a drink?

176
00:17:13,085 --> 00:17:14,758
No, thanks.

177
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:17,474
I haven't slept for 36 hours.

178
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,637
I'm going to sleep in my car.

179
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:21,085
Thank you.

180
00:18:13,645 --> 00:18:15,079
Christ!

181
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:18,002
It can't be.

182
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,319
Oh, shit.

183
00:18:22,285 --> 00:18:25,164
I was in the bar opposite.
I came back...

184
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:31,365
to find the boot open and empty.
It must have been a tip-off.

185
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:34,797
It was no accident.
And nobody was near the zoo.

186
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:36,485
It was the girl, then.

187
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:38,205
Who is this bird?

188
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:43,957
She's called Irina, a Russian.

189
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:49,242
I'm really in the shit.

190
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,677
I took the camera without asking.

191
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:54,365
It's the Russian mafia.

192
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:57,158
Don't exaggerate.

193
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:00,754
The company has it insured, surely.

194
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:04,196
I had no authorisation.
It'll be complicated.

195
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,483
I must do something.

196
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:17,076
I'll try and find the girl.

197
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:25,961
We were already broke.
This business made it worse.

198
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:30,004
Odd things happened in Zürich.

199
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:35,238
His friend Hans Peter gave him
a tip and Jonas left immediately.

200
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:38,563
He hoped to find Irina
and the camera again.

201
00:19:43,165 --> 00:19:45,361
He even had an address.

202
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:35,677
What's that guy doing here?

203
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,525
Who are you?

204
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:40,682
I want to speak to Irina.

205
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:43,241
Irina? There's no Irina here.

206
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:44,999
Get out of here!

207
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,156
I've got to talk to her.

208
00:21:48,405 --> 00:21:49,885
Throw him out!

209
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:51,441
Scram!

210
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:54,555
You've no business to be here.

211
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:56,285
Hands off, damn you.

212
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:58,961
Asshole.

213
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:02,557
Scram, asshole!

214
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:05,039
Get out, you swine.

215
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:17,799
Bloody idiots!

216
00:22:36,085 --> 00:22:38,645
Hello. Have you got
anything by Steve Reich?

217
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:42,476
No sir, that's good music,
we don't have that here.

218
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:44,918
A pity. Thank you.

219
00:23:04,965 --> 00:23:06,843
Father was my adoptive father.

220
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:09,203
I was very lucky.

221
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:12,395
He didn't look it,
but he was an engineer.

222
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:16,237
Horses were his
great passion,

223
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:18,323
and they didn't repay him.

224
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:32,519
What would you like?

225
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:34,314
A calva.

226
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:21,685
Can you lend me some money?
I'll give it back.

227
00:24:24,565 --> 00:24:25,965
Come on!

228
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:41,004
Have you lost again?

229
00:24:41,485 --> 00:24:42,760
Yes.

230
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:47,562
But I'm on to a good thing.
I've had a tip.

231
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:50,794
Please.

232
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,958
I'll give it back to you.

233
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,517
- How are you?
- Not bad.

234
00:25:32,725 --> 00:25:34,876
How much did you give your father?

235
00:25:35,965 --> 00:25:37,558
That's none of your business.

236
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:57,717
Come on, you haven't answered me.

237
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:59,997
How much did you give your father?

238
00:26:00,245 --> 00:26:03,044
What's it got to do with you.
It's my money.

239
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:05,083
No, no, no.

240
00:26:05,365 --> 00:26:08,039
It's our money.
After all, we're married.

241
00:26:09,405 --> 00:26:10,998
And in love as well.

242
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:14,159
Very much in love.

243
00:26:17,205 --> 00:26:20,915
Listen. We are broke
and your father loses all the time.

244
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:23,874
Just tell him to stop betting.

245
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:25,803
That's his business.

246
00:26:25,965 --> 00:26:27,445
And he's my father.

247
00:26:39,925 --> 00:26:42,838
You could have chosen a
better adoptive father.

248
00:26:43,045 --> 00:26:46,721
Nasty! I was only 2!
I didn't want another one, anyway.

249
00:27:27,405 --> 00:27:30,239
Jonas left for Marseille
as usual, to see..

250
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:33,364
Anziano and
recharge his batteries.

251
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,402
I was fed up with winter, but...

252
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:38,956
I understood his need to be alone.

253
00:27:39,165 --> 00:27:40,918
It was his territory.

254
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:29,000
Don't do it "as if",
but "like that".

255
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,559
What do you mean?

256
00:28:35,605 --> 00:28:36,800
Well, you see,

257
00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:41,284
in life you often do it as if.
You cheat and lie. That's normal.

258
00:28:41,645 --> 00:28:43,716
But in art, you can't.

259
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:46,682
You're trapped, my friend.

260
00:28:47,165 --> 00:28:49,805
You can't cheat and do as if.

261
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:52,316
You have to do it like that.

262
00:28:55,005 --> 00:28:56,359
But in the cinema,

263
00:28:56,925 --> 00:28:58,325
you do it as if.

264
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:01,960
The actors have to
do it as if.

265
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,276
They are playing a part.

266
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,282
Therefore, they do it as if.

267
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:11,002
They, perhaps,
but that's their work.

268
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:14,360
That's why they're so complicated.

269
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:18,805
But your work is different.
You have to do it like that.

270
00:29:23,685 --> 00:29:25,722
What does "like that" mean?

271
00:29:26,325 --> 00:29:28,282
It means that, for you,

272
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:31,204
there is only one way,
of doing things.

273
00:29:31,445 --> 00:29:33,596
Obviously, "like that".

274
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,477
Listen to good musicians.

275
00:29:37,245 --> 00:29:39,805
They know very well
what it means.

276
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:42,475
They play like that,
and not as if.

277
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:46,725
You have to discover your
own "like that".

278
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:50,677
That's where
the real questions begin.

279
00:29:52,605 --> 00:29:55,996
Well. Mr. "as if" or "like that",
shall we go to Marcel's?

280
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:59,236
It's beef stew today.

281
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,998
Do you like that sort of thing?

282
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:12,479
I don't know what it is.

283
00:30:12,925 --> 00:30:14,917
You're certainly modern.

284
00:30:15,085 --> 00:30:18,681
I'm sure you'd eat anything.
You eat as if.

285
00:30:18,845 --> 00:30:21,041
At Marcel's you eat like that.

286
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:01,563
Clear off, you little idiots!

287
00:31:09,005 --> 00:31:11,281
What's this publicity thing?

288
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:14,084
I haven't much choice.

289
00:31:16,445 --> 00:31:19,961
Don't get into it.
It'll affect you.

290
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:22,679
That's the trouble.

291
00:31:23,245 --> 00:31:26,443
Nothing but tricks,
stupidity and lies.

292
00:31:27,005 --> 00:31:29,440
I know, but I need the money.

293
00:31:34,165 --> 00:31:36,760
You haven't made that many films.

294
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:39,485
How did you manage?

295
00:31:39,925 --> 00:31:41,518
- For money?
- Yes.

296
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,243
I got by.

297
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:52,363
Your wife helped out
with translations.

298
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:55,916
It's easy to preach to others.

299
00:31:57,325 --> 00:31:59,965
Money is not the real problem.

300
00:32:00,965 --> 00:32:03,241
The problem lies elsewhere.

301
00:32:05,525 --> 00:32:06,675
Where?

302
00:32:10,885 --> 00:32:12,444
That's for you to find out.

303
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:18,714
I know.

304
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:23,324
The world, as you said,
is nearing the abyss.

305
00:32:27,685 --> 00:32:29,677
Apart from the beef stew.

306
00:32:30,445 --> 00:32:32,038
It wasn't bad, was it?

307
00:32:33,765 --> 00:32:35,358
Not bad at all.

308
00:32:45,885 --> 00:32:47,285
This is for you.

309
00:32:51,245 --> 00:32:52,759
What is it?

310
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:55,084
A camera.

311
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:02,205
Let's say, I inherited something.

312
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:08,803
These new miniature devices
are really amazing.

313
00:33:11,365 --> 00:33:14,244
Remember, it's of
professional quality.

314
00:33:14,445 --> 00:33:16,437
It's not intended as a toy.

315
00:33:17,765 --> 00:33:21,725
Now you won't need to steal
your boss's cameras any more.

316
00:33:23,565 --> 00:33:27,479
But you'll see that it's
a dangerous little machine.

317
00:33:28,165 --> 00:33:29,519
Dangerous?

318
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:31,435
Why?

319
00:33:32,205 --> 00:33:34,356
Because it gives you freedom.

320
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:37,080
You can do with it
whatever you want.

321
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:39,636
There's nothing more dangerous.

322
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:50,521
Beware of gluttony, Jonas.

323
00:33:50,725 --> 00:33:52,444
You can't film everything.

324
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:56,279
You can only film
where there's...

325
00:33:56,525 --> 00:33:59,882
resistance,
where there's opposition,

326
00:34:00,245 --> 00:34:02,760
something you must conquer.

327
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,596
Do you think the Marseille
refuse tip could be conquered?

328
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:10,125
Certainly.

329
00:34:10,405 --> 00:34:12,522
It would like to be filmed.

330
00:34:13,205 --> 00:34:17,085
- Does garbage interest you?
- No, refuse.

331
00:34:18,245 --> 00:34:19,964
It's a science, moreover.

332
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:23,195
With all the refuse
that's accumulating,

333
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:26,356
it will eventually engulf us.

334
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:31,482
When I say we're up to our necks in it,
you think I'm exaggerating.

335
00:35:34,525 --> 00:35:39,554
<i>When he returned, Jonas showed me
his pictures of the Marseille refuse tip.</i>

336
00:35:40,845 --> 00:35:43,155
<i>It was strangely fascinating.</i>

337
00:35:43,605 --> 00:35:47,394
<i>He obviously enjoyed filming
these heaps of rubbish,</i>

338
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:49,716
<i>with a certain indulgence.</i>

339
00:35:50,485 --> 00:35:54,195
<i>He spoke of his camera
in almost loving terms.</i>

340
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:05,402
Oh, what a lovely black bottom.
She's lovely.

341
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:11,160
Scram!

342
00:37:11,685 --> 00:37:13,119
Scram, I said.

343
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:20,122
What are you saying?
Isn't this a squat?

344
00:37:21,965 --> 00:37:24,355
- No.
- What is it then?

345
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:26,921
We're out in 1 month's time, anyway.

346
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:28,559
Do you pay any rent?

347
00:37:28,725 --> 00:37:31,081
No, that's the dodge.

348
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:33,437
What sort of dodge?
Tell us!

349
00:37:34,765 --> 00:37:38,281
A property dealer
lets us live here quite cheaply.

350
00:37:38,525 --> 00:37:41,404
It keeps the squatters away.
That's the dodge.

351
00:37:41,645 --> 00:37:45,844
In other words, you're watchdogs
for a property exploiter.

352
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:48,796
Aren't you worried about us?

353
00:37:49,045 --> 00:37:51,241
- They're chucking us out.
- So?

354
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:54,080
For years you've grovelled
for a lodging.

355
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:55,480
Stop it!

356
00:37:56,445 --> 00:37:58,880
We don't need your moralising.

357
00:37:59,085 --> 00:38:00,758
You're caretakers!

358
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:03,639
We'll test you.

359
00:38:04,525 --> 00:38:05,959
Can you get a camera?

360
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,398
Yes, I've one of my own now.
Why?

361
00:38:12,365 --> 00:38:14,277
We've got quite a good idea.

362
00:38:14,565 --> 00:38:17,399
The football match.
Jonas could film it.

363
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:21,042
- We could make film tracts.
- Yes, terrific.

364
00:38:22,005 --> 00:38:24,839
- I'm to film the match?
- We'll explain.

365
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:02,396
Stop it!
You'll break everything!

366
00:39:59,285 --> 00:40:01,720
Don't,
I'm fed up with this camera.

367
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:10,844
I want to film your skin.

368
00:40:20,325 --> 00:40:21,600
What, again?!

369
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:43,958
Listen to this:

370
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:49,677
"The growing attraction
of two lovers...

371
00:41:50,005 --> 00:41:52,804
is already the will to live...

372
00:41:53,005 --> 00:41:56,316
of the new individual
that they desire to create."

373
00:41:57,285 --> 00:42:00,357
"What's more, its new life arises...

374
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:03,644
when their desire-filled
looks are exchanged."

375
00:42:04,525 --> 00:42:07,757
"Their wish is for fusion
into a single being,

376
00:42:09,165 --> 00:42:11,839
in order to live within it alone."

377
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:16,359
Who's that by?

378
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:19,317
Arthur Schopenhauer.

379
00:42:19,525 --> 00:42:21,960
"Metaphysics of Love and Death."

380
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:30,398
And what about death?

381
00:42:30,685 --> 00:42:32,244
You're too intellectual.

382
00:42:32,725 --> 00:42:34,557
Let's make love first.

383
00:43:03,085 --> 00:43:04,804
Only pleasure counts.

384
00:43:07,165 --> 00:43:09,396
- You mean, in general?
- No, no.

385
00:43:12,245 --> 00:43:14,077
Pleasure of the moment.

386
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:21,282
People look for the secret
of the universe in religion...

387
00:43:22,125 --> 00:43:23,764
or science, in...

388
00:43:24,045 --> 00:43:26,082
constructing machines...

389
00:43:26,445 --> 00:43:29,677
capable of discovovering the
infinitely small or big.

390
00:43:31,965 --> 00:43:34,275
But the secret lies...

391
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,964
quite simply...

392
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:41,037
between a woman's thighs.

393
00:43:42,005 --> 00:43:43,758
What book's that from?

394
00:43:45,445 --> 00:43:47,084
It's by me.

395
00:44:11,725 --> 00:44:16,675
<i>To celebrate the first day of spring,
Jonas's friends suggested a tram ride.</i>

396
00:44:22,045 --> 00:44:23,684
I'm ready. Let's go!

397
00:45:03,565 --> 00:45:05,875
Excuse me.
May I have a puff?

398
00:45:09,805 --> 00:45:14,118
<i>The football gang was very active.</i>

399
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,516
<i>The film tracts went well.</i>

400
00:45:16,725 --> 00:45:19,957
<i>Our pro-smoker campaign
had begun.</i>

401
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:22,521
Stop pissing everyone off!

402
00:45:35,765 --> 00:45:37,757
Hunger is a poor counsellor.

403
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:41,205
When people hunger,
no state can resist.

404
00:45:42,605 --> 00:45:44,836
A hungry belly
hath no conscience.

405
00:45:45,005 --> 00:45:47,042
One sauerkraut is worth more
than two promises.

406
00:45:52,365 --> 00:45:53,515
There it comes!

407
00:45:57,205 --> 00:45:58,559
Ladies and gentlemen.

408
00:45:58,845 --> 00:46:00,484
Thank you. Enjoy it.

409
00:46:11,485 --> 00:46:13,317
That's scrumptious.

410
00:47:31,205 --> 00:47:35,722
<i>Jonas was pleased that my father
worked for a waste incineration firm.</i>

411
00:47:36,445 --> 00:47:40,644
<i>He accompanied him on a little
morning excursion on the river Rhône...</i>

412
00:47:40,845 --> 00:47:43,314
<i>to his place of work.</i>

413
00:48:08,845 --> 00:48:11,679
The problem: it's a long way.

414
00:48:12,565 --> 00:48:15,876
The flight alone
must be 3,000 francs.

415
00:48:16,445 --> 00:48:18,084
I can't afford it.

416
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:20,482
I'm collecting material for it.

417
00:48:20,725 --> 00:48:23,081
The refuse thing interests me.

418
00:48:23,325 --> 00:48:24,475
"Refuseology".

419
00:48:24,765 --> 00:48:26,757
We know what it's about.

420
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:31,363
I've got a free team next week.
Perhaps we could do something.

421
00:48:31,725 --> 00:48:32,875
Yes.

422
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:36,356
I'd prefer to work alone.

423
00:48:36,725 --> 00:48:40,162
All alone? Why?
What can I do with the others?

424
00:48:41,765 --> 00:48:43,677
Send them on another job.

425
00:48:44,285 --> 00:48:46,720
I don't understand.
Why go alone?

426
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:49,599
Because I've got
my own equipment.

427
00:48:50,685 --> 00:48:54,759
I can't imagine
working with a team here.

428
00:48:56,485 --> 00:48:59,284
Administratively difficult.

429
00:48:59,525 --> 00:49:03,439
In television, certain rules
have to be observed.

430
00:49:05,365 --> 00:49:07,357
Are you sure about your thing?

431
00:49:09,325 --> 00:49:13,035
No, it's not possible.
Unless we find a ploy.

432
00:49:22,565 --> 00:49:24,602
These stupid idiots.

433
00:49:25,765 --> 00:49:27,324
It won't work.

434
00:49:29,285 --> 00:49:30,435
We'll find something.

435
00:49:30,685 --> 00:49:34,759
- I've seen so many estate agents.
- We'll find something.

436
00:49:34,965 --> 00:49:36,445
You go, and you'll see.

437
00:49:36,605 --> 00:49:39,757
An unemployed black girl and
an unemployed film maker.

438
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:42,958
Do they want tramps
like us as tenants?

439
00:49:47,565 --> 00:49:49,158
I have to go now.

440
00:49:51,445 --> 00:49:52,925
Where to?

441
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,037
Is it your world dustbin tour?

442
00:49:57,445 --> 00:49:59,004
Yes, they've agreed.

443
00:49:59,245 --> 00:50:00,804
You could have told me.

444
00:50:00,965 --> 00:50:02,194
I'm telling you now.

445
00:50:03,485 --> 00:50:05,920
Mylord is strolling off...

446
00:50:09,365 --> 00:50:11,800
It's work.
I'm paid for it.

447
00:50:12,045 --> 00:50:14,879
I hope so!
We haven't got a bean.

448
00:50:15,925 --> 00:50:19,236
Still, you're going travelling.
You'll enjoy yourself.

449
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:22,445
Good food, good hotels,
all on offer.

450
00:50:22,685 --> 00:50:24,802
- Shut up.
- And I'm staying here,

451
00:50:24,965 --> 00:50:27,685
with agents slamming
the door in my face,

452
00:50:27,965 --> 00:50:31,595
and lazy sods
standing around and annoying me.

453
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,919
Is that a life?

454
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:39,721
I'm fed up. Do you understand?
Really fed up!

455
00:50:44,445 --> 00:50:45,799
Where are you going?

456
00:50:45,965 --> 00:50:47,479
To my sister.

457
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,599
Hey! Get away from here.
Push off!

458
00:51:04,525 --> 00:51:06,403
Scram, scram, scram.

459
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:08,679
Hooligans.

460
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:42,525
Some cheese, Elliot?

461
00:51:43,165 --> 00:51:45,964
Elliot would like
some cheese, please.

462
00:51:55,485 --> 00:51:59,525
Stop drinking! You haven't said
a word for an hour. Just boozing.

463
00:52:02,045 --> 00:52:03,604
He's drinking to forget.

464
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:05,844
You're seeking the truth?

465
00:52:06,045 --> 00:52:09,516
You'll be an alcoholic
before you find it.

466
00:52:09,765 --> 00:52:11,677
No preaching, please.

467
00:52:13,925 --> 00:52:15,757
A quarrel with Africa?

468
00:52:18,685 --> 00:52:21,280
We're out of the flat and
can't find anything.

469
00:52:41,485 --> 00:52:43,204
Hi, Jean. How are you?

470
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:44,875
Hello.

471
00:52:45,325 --> 00:52:46,884
Yes, I'm okay.

472
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,004
You've lost again?

473
00:52:50,405 --> 00:52:51,759
Yes, you see...

474
00:52:52,845 --> 00:52:55,201
- Money?
- No, forget it.

475
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:58,045
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

476
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:20,716
You must satisfy your desires.

477
00:53:22,085 --> 00:53:25,237
Gambling is a passion
like any other.

478
00:53:25,965 --> 00:53:27,194
No.

479
00:53:27,645 --> 00:53:29,284
It's a vice.

480
00:53:29,565 --> 00:53:31,522
Others drink, but I gamble.

481
00:53:33,405 --> 00:53:34,555
And?

482
00:53:36,205 --> 00:53:40,404
If everyone was virtuous,
we'd all have cardboard wings.

483
00:53:41,605 --> 00:53:44,120
There can't be anything
worse than paradise.

484
00:53:44,365 --> 00:53:47,039
Nevertheless,
I'm in in hell.

485
00:53:51,245 --> 00:53:52,725
Why do you gamble?

486
00:53:53,925 --> 00:53:56,042
I don't know. I just do.

487
00:53:58,525 --> 00:54:00,323
You must know what attracts you.

488
00:54:05,285 --> 00:54:07,117
You like losing.

489
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:11,636
Of course not.
You only play to win.

490
00:54:12,005 --> 00:54:13,837
But you're a compulsive loser.

491
00:54:14,005 --> 00:54:16,440
I also win sometimes.

492
00:54:20,005 --> 00:54:23,043
But you lose whenever
you play regularly.

493
00:54:24,165 --> 00:54:27,954
You're condemned to lose.
The organisers have devised it so.

494
00:54:28,205 --> 00:54:30,845
That's why you play.
To lose.

495
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:34,322
It's more exciting than winning.

496
00:54:35,725 --> 00:54:37,682
What you say is strange.

497
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:40,196
You just don't think of it.

498
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:47,959
At the present time,
there's nothing to win.

499
00:54:49,845 --> 00:54:52,360
I'd rather be a winner, though.

500
00:55:27,845 --> 00:55:30,235
Lose your virginity, dear?

501
00:55:30,405 --> 00:55:33,523
- Feeling down, ducky?
- Short time, ducky?

502
00:55:33,765 --> 00:55:36,360
- Fuck off!
- Go to Mummy.

503
00:56:43,005 --> 00:56:46,999
<i>Jonas had received money
from the TV for Central America.</i>

504
00:56:47,685 --> 00:56:52,601
<i>I was alone, but things were
more complicated than anticipated.</i>

505
00:56:53,765 --> 00:56:57,202
<i>Faced with people who had
only rubbish for survival,</i>

506
00:56:57,405 --> 00:57:01,160
<i>he felt like a Peeping Tom
caught in his own trap.</i>

507
00:57:13,765 --> 00:57:17,918
On earth, more and more people
producing more and more waste.

508
00:57:24,485 --> 00:57:27,876
All the Third World cities
will eventually implode.

509
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:30,321
Or explode through waste gases.

510
00:57:30,565 --> 00:57:32,602
Either way, it's all the same.

511
00:57:33,525 --> 00:57:35,118
It's madness.

512
00:57:37,965 --> 00:57:39,684
It'll happen here too.

513
00:57:40,485 --> 00:57:42,124
You shit like all the others.

514
00:57:42,405 --> 00:57:44,681
Make 10x more waste than they do.

515
00:57:45,405 --> 00:57:47,124
And you're boring.

516
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:54,282
Perhaps you have material
for a film tract.

517
00:58:02,285 --> 00:58:04,641
I don't think so.

518
00:58:05,725 --> 00:58:09,082
These film tracts
are schoolboy pranks.

519
00:58:29,765 --> 00:58:32,564
I found this when tidying up.

520
00:58:32,805 --> 00:58:34,319
It was 5 years ago...

521
00:58:36,165 --> 00:58:38,475
that I first held a camera.

522
00:59:01,165 --> 00:59:02,599
What was it?

523
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:05,405
It was in Geneva.

524
00:59:06,685 --> 00:59:08,756
An anti-army demonstration.

525
00:59:10,365 --> 00:59:14,518
The cops beat me up. They wanted
the film of the demonstrators.

526
00:59:14,845 --> 00:59:16,438
I was able to save it.

527
00:59:18,485 --> 00:59:20,920
I threw the rest down a manhole.

528
00:59:50,765 --> 00:59:54,042
Such things happen
in your peaceful country?

529
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:57,718
The police protecting the army...

530
00:59:58,525 --> 01:00:00,403
from the people...

531
01:00:01,285 --> 01:00:03,117
makes a beautiful metaphor.

532
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:08,641
The question is what to do,
what can be done now.

533
01:00:09,725 --> 01:00:11,125
What do you mean?

534
01:00:11,445 --> 01:00:14,597
What to do against it all:
the world,

535
01:00:14,805 --> 01:00:16,603
the new world order.

536
01:00:16,765 --> 01:00:20,725
They keep saying it's inevitable.
It's depressing.

537
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:23,638
It's revolting.

538
01:00:24,365 --> 01:00:26,960
So, first of all
you will be depressed,

539
01:00:27,645 --> 01:00:30,080
then you'll despair,

540
01:00:30,645 --> 01:00:32,762
and finally you'll revolt.

541
01:00:32,965 --> 01:00:36,515
Yes, but how? To destroy?
To resort to violence?

542
01:00:37,445 --> 01:00:38,765
And against whom?

543
01:00:40,205 --> 01:00:41,525
Against what?

544
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:46,516
It's true. In our time,
the enemies were easily identifiable.

545
01:00:47,045 --> 01:00:51,562
Now they race over computer
networks at the speed of light.

546
01:00:52,005 --> 01:00:53,997
You can no longer catch them.

547
01:00:54,285 --> 01:00:57,642
Or you have to know
how to inject a virus.

548
01:00:59,165 --> 01:01:00,963
As on New Year's Day,

549
01:01:01,645 --> 01:01:04,717
when computers failed and
the trains couldn't run.

550
01:01:05,645 --> 01:01:07,796
We could be modern pirates.

551
01:01:08,005 --> 01:01:09,200
That's it.

552
01:01:09,605 --> 01:01:12,962
Do you know
how to make viruses?

553
01:01:13,245 --> 01:01:15,441
No. But you can always learn.

554
01:01:18,645 --> 01:01:21,114
That's probably
the violence of the future.

555
01:01:22,925 --> 01:01:24,564
That's not very funny.

556
01:01:34,085 --> 01:01:35,917
I'd prefer to smash something.

557
01:01:36,085 --> 01:01:37,724
Something tangible...

558
01:01:38,485 --> 01:01:40,477
with friends and people.

559
01:01:40,685 --> 01:01:44,156
Be certain that it'll
break of its own accord,

560
01:01:44,365 --> 01:01:46,197
piece by piece.

561
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:48,602
Apocalypse in slow motion.

562
01:01:51,285 --> 01:01:53,561
Rather primitive cynicism!

563
01:01:54,805 --> 01:01:56,717
After the time of high ideals,

564
01:01:57,005 --> 01:02:00,476
you are now disenchanted.
But what remains for us?

565
01:02:00,725 --> 01:02:02,364
Nothing. Zero.

566
01:02:02,605 --> 01:02:05,677
No political horizon,
no utopia. Nothing.

567
01:02:07,445 --> 01:02:11,564
Your generation devoured
that dream and left us the ruins.

568
01:02:11,845 --> 01:02:14,235
But generations are unreal.

569
01:02:15,045 --> 01:02:18,880
They are little cages that
were invented to enclose people.

570
01:02:20,005 --> 01:02:22,315
Only history advances.

571
01:02:22,605 --> 01:02:24,836
It's for you to follow history.

572
01:02:26,485 --> 01:02:28,522
But first you must know it.

573
01:02:30,685 --> 01:02:32,483
Look around you!

574
01:02:33,965 --> 01:02:37,117
Lies sprout everywhere
like poisonous mushrooms,

575
01:02:38,285 --> 01:02:40,481
and nobody sees them.

576
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:46,885
"The greatest need
of the mafia...

577
01:02:47,445 --> 01:02:50,517
is to confirm
that it doesn't exist...

578
01:02:51,085 --> 01:02:55,238
or that it is the victim
of unfounded calumny.

579
01:02:55,965 --> 01:02:58,480
And herein lies
the first similarity...

580
01:02:58,685 --> 01:03:00,483
with capitalism.

581
01:03:08,245 --> 01:03:12,319
The mafia flourishes
with the advance in computers,

582
01:03:12,685 --> 01:03:15,325
industrial nutrition,

583
01:03:15,605 --> 01:03:19,519
new town planning
and slums,

584
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:23,442
intelligence services
and illiteracy."

585
01:03:44,045 --> 01:03:45,274
Nothing.

586
01:03:45,965 --> 01:03:48,161
I was expecting a call about a job.

587
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:50,642
They usually need me on Fridays.

588
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:52,765
I thought it was them.

589
01:03:54,285 --> 01:03:56,720
I've earned very little this week.

590
01:04:22,445 --> 01:04:25,756
The big problem
is to make a decision.

591
01:04:27,005 --> 01:04:28,883
But you alone can do that.

592
01:04:29,805 --> 01:04:33,719
Decide, Jonas.
Here, now and before me.

593
01:04:34,885 --> 01:04:37,480
I've already decided.
I'll make films.

594
01:04:37,725 --> 01:04:41,036
Yes, but you dabble for the moment.
Collect pictures.

595
01:04:46,365 --> 01:04:48,118
Do you know Pessoa?

596
01:04:48,365 --> 01:04:49,481
No.

597
01:04:49,965 --> 01:04:54,039
He died in 1935,
So he wrote it before then.

598
01:04:55,165 --> 01:04:57,839
He had already understood.
Listen.

599
01:04:59,765 --> 01:05:01,563
"Today...

600
01:05:01,805 --> 01:05:04,320
the world belongs to fools,

601
01:05:04,605 --> 01:05:07,245
the restless and heartless.

602
01:05:08,365 --> 01:05:12,484
The right to live is now
ensured by the same means as...

603
01:05:12,725 --> 01:05:17,163
those bestowing the right to be
interned in a lunatic asylum:

604
01:05:18,045 --> 01:05:21,402
the incapacity to think,
immorality...

605
01:05:22,245 --> 01:05:24,555
and overexitement."

606
01:05:41,725 --> 01:05:45,435
<i>Some weeks had past, but
May brought nothing new.</i>

607
01:05:45,685 --> 01:05:48,837
<i>We still had no money
or a flat in view.</i>

608
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:54,083
<i>Jonas believed he'd seen his Russian
in the Geneva red light district.</i>

609
01:05:54,445 --> 01:05:58,883
<i>He was sure of it and seemed
to have only one thing in mind:</i>

610
01:05:59,125 --> 01:06:00,605
<i>to find her.</i>

611
01:06:06,805 --> 01:06:09,957
- Don't take that, it's rubbish.
- No, it's very good.

612
01:06:10,165 --> 01:06:12,043
You'll hate it within a week.

613
01:06:12,565 --> 01:06:15,444
We do, and that's
why they don't sell.

614
01:06:55,885 --> 01:06:58,320
You were the only one
who knew about the camera.

615
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:02,001
What would I do with it?

616
01:07:02,725 --> 01:07:04,603
Not you, but your friends.

617
01:07:05,125 --> 01:07:07,924
What friends?
I haven't any friends.

618
01:07:09,005 --> 01:07:11,884
Those in the house
making a sex film.

619
01:07:22,965 --> 01:07:25,605
Would you give me a part
in a real film?

620
01:07:27,685 --> 01:07:29,756
I've only done theatre before.

621
01:07:30,445 --> 01:07:33,005
I liked the story
with the gorillas.

622
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:37,242
What sort of theatre is this?

623
01:07:42,005 --> 01:07:43,883
I'm just waiting for a part.

624
01:07:47,285 --> 01:07:49,117
There are only whores here.

625
01:07:49,325 --> 01:07:51,157
I encourage people to drink.

626
01:07:52,725 --> 01:07:53,761
Not funny.

627
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:56,840
- Have you seen their faces?
- I know.

628
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:04,204
Get out of this dive.

629
01:08:06,085 --> 01:08:08,202
I'll take you out.
Come on.

630
01:08:08,725 --> 01:08:10,796
- I can't. Impossible.
- Why?

631
01:08:10,965 --> 01:08:12,718
- Because.
- Because what?

632
01:08:14,605 --> 01:08:16,562
Because I owe them money.

633
01:08:18,805 --> 01:08:20,034
Who to?

634
01:08:21,845 --> 01:08:23,962
To those who brought me here.

635
01:08:24,245 --> 01:08:26,919
- Who are these yobs?
- I don't know.

636
01:08:33,245 --> 01:08:34,838
They'll never let me go.

637
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:39,085
I'll take you with me.
I'll pay and take you.

638
01:08:39,965 --> 01:08:41,319
I can't.

639
01:08:43,525 --> 01:08:45,881
- Where are we going?
- Never mind.

640
01:08:46,685 --> 01:08:48,244
You'll die here.

641
01:09:18,365 --> 01:09:21,324
This is Irina.
The Russian actress.

642
01:09:23,085 --> 01:09:26,965
She's staying a few days here,
because she's got nowhere to go.

643
01:09:28,845 --> 01:09:32,441
Leave your things here.
Sleep in the little room.

644
01:09:42,725 --> 01:09:44,045
You're crazy.

645
01:09:44,285 --> 01:09:47,835
We haven't any money,
and you bring this bird home.

646
01:09:48,085 --> 01:09:50,759
She has to be helped.
She's in real trouble.

647
01:09:51,765 --> 01:09:53,836
Saint Jonas, pray for us...

648
01:10:11,965 --> 01:10:14,116
Have you got a cigarette?

649
01:10:24,525 --> 01:10:26,835
You're finished here.
You're fired.

650
01:10:28,245 --> 01:10:29,645
Fired?

651
01:10:30,165 --> 01:10:32,805
- Are you joking?
- Orders from the boss.

652
01:10:32,965 --> 01:10:36,436
You told customers
that we only sell rubbish here.

653
01:10:37,965 --> 01:10:40,036
What do I do then? Push off?

654
01:10:40,285 --> 01:10:41,878
Yes, push off.

655
01:11:51,885 --> 01:11:53,558
Who are these blokes?

656
01:11:54,445 --> 01:11:56,641
- What blokes?
- Not noticed?

657
01:11:56,885 --> 01:12:00,242
They've been there all morning.
Seen their faces?

658
01:12:02,205 --> 01:12:04,276
I don't know who they are.

659
01:12:06,525 --> 01:12:09,916
From the owner perhaps,
to watch over the dump?

660
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,718
What for?

661
01:12:14,885 --> 01:12:16,842
Maybe to keep squatters out.

662
01:12:17,485 --> 01:12:20,557
- Your girlfriend's bodyguards?
- No.

663
01:12:20,765 --> 01:12:22,085
Ask her.

664
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,279
What is it?

665
01:12:38,925 --> 01:12:40,678
D'you know those blokes?

666
01:12:43,005 --> 01:12:44,075
No.

667
01:12:44,285 --> 01:12:46,197
Could they be your friends?

668
01:12:47,885 --> 01:12:50,241
- I've never seen them.
- Certain?

669
01:12:50,565 --> 01:12:52,284
Better not go out.

670
01:12:52,565 --> 01:12:54,602
I said I don't know them.

671
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:03,282
I'm sure it's because of her.
That's just what we need.

672
01:13:03,525 --> 01:13:05,198
You're imagining things.

673
01:13:05,405 --> 01:13:08,842
Irina's a whore.
They won't let their money go.

674
01:13:09,605 --> 01:13:11,085
No. Stop it.

675
01:13:19,485 --> 01:13:24,560
<i>I didn't much like the country,
but I made the best of it.</i>

676
01:13:27,245 --> 01:13:30,443
<i>Cécile, Jonas's sister,
and her husband Peter...</i>

677
01:13:30,685 --> 01:13:33,917
<i>lived with their 3 children
in a French village...</i>

678
01:13:34,165 --> 01:13:37,078
<i>since it's cheaper
than in Switzerland.</i>

679
01:13:48,285 --> 01:13:49,560
Hi, Cécile.

680
01:13:53,525 --> 01:13:56,836
There are 2 beds
and a mattress in the loft.

681
01:13:57,085 --> 01:13:58,280
Right.

682
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:17,561
- It's only temporary.
- Of course.

683
01:14:18,365 --> 01:14:20,596
Everything's temporary now.

684
01:14:20,965 --> 01:14:23,844
Temporary means "for the moment",

685
01:14:24,085 --> 01:14:25,997
"the future's before us",

686
01:14:26,205 --> 01:14:30,882
"better times ahead", and
"you must learn to adapt".

687
01:14:31,045 --> 01:14:32,525
That's it, that's it.

688
01:14:34,805 --> 01:14:36,319
Who's your Russian?

689
01:14:37,925 --> 01:14:39,405
She's an actress.

690
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:42,484
She used to work in a bar,

691
01:14:42,725 --> 01:14:45,718
and she owes money to
some dicey types.

692
01:14:45,925 --> 01:14:48,485
I get it.
A prostitute.

693
01:14:48,765 --> 01:14:51,963
No, she just encourages
customers to drink.

694
01:14:53,645 --> 01:14:55,284
I had to get her out.

695
01:14:56,285 --> 01:14:57,765
Yes, but why her?

696
01:14:58,525 --> 01:15:00,676
Because I knew her.

697
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:04,634
We'll manage.
You have some space here.

698
01:15:04,885 --> 01:15:06,797
It's the only place where we
can be right now.

699
01:15:08,085 --> 01:15:09,519
You're my sister.

700
01:15:10,245 --> 01:15:12,555
- We're in the shit.
- So are we.

701
01:15:12,765 --> 01:15:14,279
- Less.
- The same.

702
01:15:14,525 --> 01:15:17,836
- D'you think we like living here?
- We've got nowhere to live.

703
01:15:18,005 --> 01:15:21,077
- Go to our parents.
- That's out in the sticks.

704
01:15:21,325 --> 01:15:23,237
- Here as well.
- Less.

705
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:25,795
As much.

706
01:15:26,045 --> 01:15:27,684
- Less.
- As much.

707
01:15:33,005 --> 01:15:35,600
What's that?
Have you got a mobile?

708
01:15:36,085 --> 01:15:39,123
I need one, because I
work as a temp.

709
01:15:40,005 --> 01:15:42,156
You can be rung anywhere.

710
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,600
Either you stay at home
by the phone...

711
01:15:46,205 --> 01:15:47,719
or you have a mobile.

712
01:15:47,965 --> 01:15:49,684
We've no flat anyway.

713
01:15:50,525 --> 01:15:52,357
You don't answer.

714
01:15:53,205 --> 01:15:55,436
No. They get on my nerves.

715
01:15:56,365 --> 01:15:58,960
They can piss off.
Bunch of assholes.

716
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:02,001
That's delicately expressed.

717
01:16:02,845 --> 01:16:06,839
Soon, all slaves will have
a mobile on their backside,

718
01:16:07,045 --> 01:16:08,525
day and night.

719
01:16:08,765 --> 01:16:10,165
Is that where yours is?

720
01:16:11,005 --> 01:16:13,520
Your backside will soon be
bip bipping.

721
01:16:13,805 --> 01:16:15,797
All our backsides 'll be bipping.

722
01:16:17,925 --> 01:16:21,885
Those of the girls as well.
Many of them do already.

723
01:16:36,045 --> 01:16:37,320
Do you think...

724
01:16:38,045 --> 01:16:40,435
I should give Lila a child?

725
01:16:40,765 --> 01:16:42,996
Lila or Irina?

726
01:16:45,405 --> 01:16:46,759
Don't be stupid.

727
01:16:47,005 --> 01:16:49,474
I saw you looking
at the beautiful Russian.

728
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:51,844
Yes, she is beautiful.

729
01:16:52,045 --> 01:16:56,164
You know, Jonas, children come
without much reflection.

730
01:16:56,805 --> 01:17:00,435
You always want to decide.
Let yourself go a bit.

731
01:17:46,365 --> 01:17:49,881
I thought you finished early.
You left at 5 o'clock.

732
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,565
I was driving around.

733
01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:55,355
I'm fed up with the bloody job.
I had to relax a bit.

734
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,724
What do you do?

735
01:17:58,885 --> 01:18:01,878
Previously,
I was a plane mechanic.

736
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:03,645
My thing: mechanics.

737
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:08,401
But they moved, and
only baggage handling was left.

738
01:18:10,805 --> 01:18:13,718
Now I unload baggage
for 30% less wages.

739
01:18:13,925 --> 01:18:16,281
That's why we live here.

740
01:18:17,325 --> 01:18:19,123
And you love motorbikes?

741
01:18:19,525 --> 01:18:20,959
Yes, very much.

742
01:18:21,205 --> 01:18:23,595
Then come myself and the kids.

743
01:18:24,445 --> 01:18:25,845
Don't confuse everything.

744
01:18:27,365 --> 01:18:29,596
A motorbike ride is the tops.

745
01:18:29,885 --> 01:18:33,322
A motorbike is as intelligent
as a horse, but faster.

746
01:18:33,605 --> 01:18:36,245
Motorcyclists are
married to their machines.

747
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:39,324
The purr of the engine,
the scenery.

748
01:18:40,165 --> 01:18:42,555
I've loved my bike for 10 years.

749
01:18:43,365 --> 01:18:46,324
I've never been on one,
but I can understand.

750
01:18:47,925 --> 01:18:49,279
Would you like a ride?

751
01:18:49,485 --> 01:18:51,283
- Now?
- Why not?

752
01:18:52,685 --> 01:18:54,358
Come on, I'll take you.

753
01:19:17,885 --> 01:19:19,524
Come what may!

754
01:19:19,805 --> 01:19:23,321
Another 50 km ride with a leach
hugging him from behind.

755
01:19:23,605 --> 01:19:24,516
Shut up.

756
01:19:24,765 --> 01:19:28,042
You're all the same. Glimpse
a bottom and away at 50 mph.

757
01:19:28,245 --> 01:19:30,965
Mind you. He's not the first
for your Russian.

758
01:19:33,365 --> 01:19:35,436
D'you think she likes it?

759
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:39,323
She was a student and an actress
and finished up in bars.

760
01:19:39,605 --> 01:19:41,278
She should have stayed in Moscow.

761
01:19:42,965 --> 01:19:45,400
She needs help. That's all.

762
01:20:46,965 --> 01:20:48,445
You're making a film?

763
01:20:51,725 --> 01:20:53,557
You're right. A lovely body.

764
01:21:00,485 --> 01:21:02,158
Give me the camera?

765
01:21:02,365 --> 01:21:03,685
What for?

766
01:21:03,885 --> 01:21:06,605
To film you both.
Give it to me.

767
01:21:06,965 --> 01:21:08,285
How does it work?

768
01:21:08,645 --> 01:21:11,604
You press the knob.
It's automatic.

769
01:21:12,965 --> 01:21:14,604
What d'you want to film?

770
01:21:15,725 --> 01:21:17,000
You two.

771
01:21:17,525 --> 01:21:18,959
A beautiful pair.

772
01:21:19,845 --> 01:21:21,484
Kissing, for example.

773
01:21:22,285 --> 01:21:23,799
Kissing?

774
01:21:25,565 --> 01:21:27,636
Yes, or more if you like.

775
01:21:28,325 --> 01:21:29,725
What do you mean?

776
01:21:29,925 --> 01:21:31,439
I don't know.

777
01:21:33,445 --> 01:21:34,959
A love scene.

778
01:21:35,205 --> 01:21:37,356
You make love and I'll film it.

779
01:21:39,045 --> 01:21:41,241
Yes, porno is your thing.

780
01:21:41,445 --> 01:21:43,323
It'll be a souvenir for you.

781
01:21:43,525 --> 01:21:44,959
A souvenir, what for?

782
01:21:45,165 --> 01:21:46,804
Yes, that 'a good idea.

783
01:21:47,285 --> 01:21:50,278
We can look at it,
when we're 75 years old.

784
01:21:51,445 --> 01:21:52,925
Are you backing out?

785
01:21:57,565 --> 01:21:59,079
If it amuses you.

786
01:22:02,365 --> 01:22:04,800
I'd rather be behind the camera.

787
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:06,525
Behind the camera?

788
01:22:07,485 --> 01:22:09,716
- While we make love?
- No.

789
01:22:10,845 --> 01:22:12,598
I'll film, and...

790
01:22:12,925 --> 01:22:15,156
you and Irina make love.

791
01:22:19,325 --> 01:22:20,759
Neither more nor less.

792
01:22:22,405 --> 01:22:23,805
Why not?

793
01:22:24,085 --> 01:22:25,883
It's only a film.

794
01:22:26,765 --> 01:22:29,883
You always say
that cinema is not reality.

795
01:22:31,485 --> 01:22:33,716
Are your backing out now?

796
01:22:36,245 --> 01:22:37,281
No.

797
01:22:39,525 --> 01:22:42,563
But we must ask Irina
what she thinks.

798
01:22:45,525 --> 01:22:47,039
Why not?

799
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:50,804
If it amuses you,
I'll play in your film.

800
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:18,356
It's you who wanted the film.

801
01:23:55,365 --> 01:23:56,958
You remember our vow?

802
01:23:58,365 --> 01:24:00,118
Faithful for eternity.

803
01:24:03,165 --> 01:24:06,203
- Did you want to break it?
- No way.

804
01:24:11,325 --> 01:24:12,725
Was it good?

805
01:24:16,285 --> 01:24:18,163
Not as good as with you.

806
01:24:36,445 --> 01:24:41,076
<i>Jonas left again for Marseille.
We needed space.</i>

807
01:24:42,205 --> 01:24:45,994
<i>We'd gone too far.
It seemed a game I thought I'd win.</i>

808
01:24:46,885 --> 01:24:49,719
<i>But everybody lost.</i>

809
01:24:50,125 --> 01:24:54,005
<i>We were trapped by this damned camera
and I'd the feeling...</i>

810
01:24:54,285 --> 01:24:58,074
<i>that it would be difficult
for Irina to remain among us.</i>

811
01:25:01,965 --> 01:25:04,241
Have you ever done a porno film?

812
01:25:05,045 --> 01:25:07,276
One or two soft porns.

813
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:10,276
In Zurich. I needed money.

814
01:25:11,085 --> 01:25:12,314
But yesterday,

815
01:25:13,365 --> 01:25:15,596
when you filmed with Jonas,

816
01:25:16,085 --> 01:25:18,077
did you come or just pretend?

817
01:25:18,245 --> 01:25:20,714
No, I really came.

818
01:25:21,765 --> 01:25:24,200
But I come quickly if I want to.

819
01:25:28,365 --> 01:25:30,084
Did you find it funny?

820
01:25:30,285 --> 01:25:31,605
No.

821
01:25:32,045 --> 01:25:33,320
Not really.

822
01:25:36,805 --> 01:25:38,762
Have you got a profession?

823
01:25:38,965 --> 01:25:42,515
No. I went to high school
and got A levels.

824
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:44,558
But you can't do
anything with that.

825
01:25:45,125 --> 01:25:47,481
Anyway, learning a trade
these days...

826
01:25:47,925 --> 01:25:49,405
What?

827
01:25:50,485 --> 01:25:53,080
Your life consists of living
with Jonas?

828
01:25:53,405 --> 01:25:54,805
That's already something.

829
01:25:55,725 --> 01:25:59,036
But I also like reading.
Any kind of book.

830
01:25:59,725 --> 01:26:03,639
Even philosophy. I don't understand
everything, but I figure it out.

831
01:26:04,085 --> 01:26:07,203
To earn some money,
I work as a temp.

832
01:26:08,925 --> 01:26:10,279
And you?

833
01:26:10,485 --> 01:26:12,317
Oh, me.

834
01:26:14,165 --> 01:26:16,805
I always wanted to
act in the theatre.

835
01:26:20,245 --> 01:26:22,316
Now we're both here.

836
01:26:54,645 --> 01:26:56,079
Come in.

837
01:27:23,765 --> 01:27:25,597
He doesn't want to see anyone.

838
01:27:27,805 --> 01:27:29,797
This happens more and more.

839
01:27:30,125 --> 01:27:33,118
It's one of those bad days
when he doesn't want to talk.

840
01:27:38,205 --> 01:27:39,924
But what's he doing?

841
01:27:40,365 --> 01:27:41,845
I don't know.

842
01:27:42,685 --> 01:27:46,201
Oh yes, he's writing on
small pieces of paper...

843
01:27:46,605 --> 01:27:48,119
or in exercise books.

844
01:27:49,045 --> 01:27:51,958
The company of cigars and
whisky is enough.

845
01:28:02,885 --> 01:28:04,763
Even if he knows I'm here?

846
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:06,964
That makes no difference.

847
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:06,604
Do you see him?

848
01:29:07,045 --> 01:29:08,240
No.

849
01:29:09,805 --> 01:29:11,717
But at least I know he's there.

850
01:29:13,285 --> 01:29:15,959
Previously,
he'd leave for days...

851
01:29:16,325 --> 01:29:17,839
without saying where...

852
01:29:18,205 --> 01:29:20,674
or offering the
slightest explanation.

853
01:29:25,205 --> 01:29:29,085
One evening, we came home late.
We'd drunk a lot...

854
01:29:31,005 --> 01:29:32,598
He didn't want to go home.

855
01:29:33,405 --> 01:29:35,715
His eyes held a strange energy,

856
01:29:36,165 --> 01:29:37,918
as if he wanted...

857
01:29:38,605 --> 01:29:40,836
the night to last forever.

858
01:29:41,925 --> 01:29:46,238
It was as if he wanted
to kill something within him.

859
01:29:49,045 --> 01:29:50,798
He once spoke...

860
01:29:51,565 --> 01:29:54,034
of suicide, but only in jest.

861
01:29:55,085 --> 01:29:56,997
Do you think he was serious?

862
01:29:59,485 --> 01:30:00,839
I don't know.

863
01:30:02,445 --> 01:30:04,914
Perhaps isolation
attracts him,

864
01:30:06,285 --> 01:30:07,878
the silence.

865
01:30:09,365 --> 01:30:11,038
Or he hides away...

866
01:30:11,805 --> 01:30:14,479
like a sick animal.

867
01:30:51,605 --> 01:30:53,722
- There comes Jonas.
- Is anybody there?

868
01:30:58,285 --> 01:31:00,356
Hello, uncle Jonas.

869
01:31:02,325 --> 01:31:04,521
- Nice in Marseille?
- Yes, very.

870
01:31:06,045 --> 01:31:07,559
Isn't Irina here?

871
01:31:07,765 --> 01:31:10,200
No. She left without a word.

872
01:31:11,045 --> 01:31:13,480
She's not cut out
for country life.

873
01:31:15,925 --> 01:31:18,520
Maybe. But if she
goes back to Geneva,

874
01:31:19,285 --> 01:31:21,163
she'll fall back again.

875
01:31:21,405 --> 01:31:22,964
You'll miss her...

876
01:31:23,205 --> 01:31:25,481
Don' be stupid, that's not it.

877
01:31:25,805 --> 01:31:27,683
I'm afraid for her, that's all.

878
01:31:28,805 --> 01:31:30,842
You'd always like to be an angel.

879
01:31:31,085 --> 01:31:33,441
But angels have no sex.

880
01:31:34,285 --> 01:31:38,245
That's not been decided, my dear.
It's still frequently discussed.

881
01:31:47,005 --> 01:31:50,965
<i>At last we had a new flat.
A real squat this time,</i>

882
01:31:51,205 --> 01:31:55,563
<i>a bit dilapidated. We just
took our bed, table and chairs...</i>

883
01:31:55,845 --> 01:31:59,998
<i>and a hi-fi. Henceforth,
everything was only provisional.</i>

884
01:32:00,525 --> 01:32:03,085
<i>Except the things
between Jonas and me.</i>

885
01:32:18,805 --> 01:32:20,478
Hello, sea!

886
01:32:49,525 --> 01:32:51,357
I must read something to you.

887
01:33:13,765 --> 01:33:14,994
Listen.

888
01:33:16,885 --> 01:33:19,684
"We're the children
of a devastated world,

889
01:33:20,165 --> 01:33:22,999
who are trying
to be born into a new world."

890
01:33:25,205 --> 01:33:28,516
"Learning to be human
is the only radical thing."

891
01:33:33,885 --> 01:33:35,444
I feel that...

892
01:33:36,485 --> 01:33:39,284
people are becoming
uglier and more stupid.

893
01:33:42,365 --> 01:33:44,243
It's sad, but inevitable.

894
01:33:45,485 --> 01:33:47,363
They're programmed that way.

895
01:34:46,645 --> 01:34:47,840
Hey, Jonas.

896
01:34:49,365 --> 01:34:51,436
You thought I was a loser?

897
01:34:53,005 --> 01:34:54,724
But this time I've won.

898
01:34:56,325 --> 01:34:58,635
And with the money,

899
01:34:59,765 --> 01:35:02,041
I'm buying your flight to Dakar.

900
01:35:02,445 --> 01:35:04,562
A visit to your granny, Lila.

901
01:35:08,325 --> 01:35:10,317
An old promise,

902
01:35:11,325 --> 01:35:13,237
from the time before Mummy left us.

903
01:35:13,885 --> 01:35:15,877
If only I hadn't lost so often...

904
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:17,644
How much did you win?

905
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:20,041
We'll go and see the results.

906
01:35:46,165 --> 01:35:47,440
Well?

907
01:35:47,685 --> 01:35:49,483
Enough for the flight.

908
01:35:49,725 --> 01:35:51,159
But nothing for you.

909
01:35:51,725 --> 01:35:55,605
Since you're on a lucky streak,
play these 5 numbers for us.

910
01:36:01,405 --> 01:36:02,839
Listen to this.

911
01:36:05,085 --> 01:36:07,964
"We have mentioned
neither the mob,

912
01:36:08,245 --> 01:36:10,316
the bruised, the rotten,

913
01:36:10,525 --> 01:36:14,405
nor the sweepings, refuse
and peelings."

914
01:36:14,685 --> 01:36:18,122
"Nor the slimy,
burnt or cracked material."

915
01:36:18,525 --> 01:36:21,996
"All this substance
arouses the same repulsion...

916
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:26,638
and would deserve to be treated
with opprobrium."

917
01:36:26,925 --> 01:36:28,245
What book's that?

918
01:36:28,405 --> 01:36:30,840
A Philosophy of Refuse.

919
01:36:31,045 --> 01:36:34,163
A rehabilitation of shit.
The nobility of refuse.

920
01:36:34,485 --> 01:36:38,081
I'm also into philosophy,
if I understand it aright.

921
01:36:38,445 --> 01:36:42,405
I've always sensed a certain
nobility about my activities.

922
01:37:22,605 --> 01:37:25,996
At home, you can film whatever
you want, but not here.

923
01:37:35,965 --> 01:37:37,638
Don't film any refuse.

924
01:37:38,085 --> 01:37:40,042
Ecology is only for the rich.

925
01:37:57,605 --> 01:38:00,325
We'll go and film
my grandmother.

926
01:38:02,645 --> 01:38:04,364
Don't you like family films?

927
01:38:06,045 --> 01:38:06,922
Let's go.

928
01:38:11,045 --> 01:38:14,925
It's you who says that films
and pictures preserve the past.

929
01:38:52,005 --> 01:38:53,598
I'm looking for M'doumbé.

930
01:38:55,765 --> 01:38:56,835
She's upstairs.

931
01:39:49,725 --> 01:39:51,318
Yes. Who is it?

932
01:39:52,765 --> 01:39:53,960
Lila.

933
01:40:03,525 --> 01:40:06,677
Oh, my dearest child.
No, it can't be true.

934
01:40:07,405 --> 01:40:09,476
I so much wanted to see you.

935
01:40:13,605 --> 01:40:15,278
Lila, my dearest.

936
01:40:24,485 --> 01:40:25,965
This is Jonas...

937
01:40:26,725 --> 01:40:28,159
...my husband.

938
01:40:29,725 --> 01:40:32,081
With a camera instead of a head.

939
01:40:33,725 --> 01:40:35,284
Come, come.

940
01:40:41,845 --> 01:40:44,041
What's happening with the camera?

941
01:40:45,645 --> 01:40:47,955
Where am I in your story?

942
01:41:05,565 --> 01:41:09,036
<i>I was happy to see grandma
and the people...</i>

943
01:41:09,565 --> 01:41:11,284
<i>of this country,
whom I loved.</i>

944
01:41:12,005 --> 01:41:15,521
<i>But I was now a stranger,
without the language.</i>

945
01:41:16,365 --> 01:41:19,642
<i>I moved and thought
differently from them.</i>

946
01:41:19,845 --> 01:41:23,680
<i>They saw me as a European.
I was an exile.</i>

947
01:41:25,165 --> 01:41:29,762
<i>A destiny like any other.
No possible return to the roots.</i>

948
01:41:31,405 --> 01:41:36,036
<i>Someone once said that
only trees have real roots...</i>

949
01:41:36,285 --> 01:41:39,801
<i>and they'd probably be
very happy to take a plane.</i>

950
01:41:40,125 --> 01:41:43,721
<i>Jonas maintains that his
own country doesn't exist.</i>

951
01:41:44,725 --> 01:41:47,240
<i>We were really
made for each other.</i>

952
01:43:13,125 --> 01:43:15,685
You took your camera?
Will you show us?

953
01:43:16,005 --> 01:43:16,961
Yes.

954
01:43:17,245 --> 01:43:19,476
Is it fun filming the poor?

955
01:43:21,885 --> 01:43:24,002
Since you can't film the rich...

956
01:43:24,285 --> 01:43:25,560
Why not?

957
01:43:26,565 --> 01:43:28,796
You can't.
They don't imprint on film.

958
01:43:30,485 --> 01:43:32,920
- D'you understand me?
- No, not really.

959
01:43:34,125 --> 01:43:35,923
They've nothing to say to us.

960
01:43:37,005 --> 01:43:39,395
So you only filmed destitution?

961
01:43:40,045 --> 01:43:43,356
No, you can't film that either.
You mustn't.

962
01:43:44,045 --> 01:43:46,640
- What did you film then?
- People.

963
01:43:49,045 --> 01:43:51,435
They're not destitute.
They're just poor.

964
01:43:51,645 --> 01:43:54,240
But they keep their dignity...

965
01:43:54,485 --> 01:43:56,158
and they know life.

966
01:44:00,285 --> 01:44:02,356
How do you measure poverty?

967
01:44:03,485 --> 01:44:04,805
By our standards?

968
01:44:05,045 --> 01:44:08,959
Why should those be the only
measure of rich and poor?

969
01:44:09,525 --> 01:44:13,439
Destitution is when it affects health.

970
01:44:13,965 --> 01:44:17,083
But whoever has food, a roof
and children at school,

971
01:44:17,245 --> 01:44:18,998
is not destitute.

972
01:44:19,805 --> 01:44:21,398
You, for example,

973
01:44:22,485 --> 01:44:25,478
are poor,
but not destitute.

974
01:44:26,525 --> 01:44:28,721
- Down there I'd be rich.
- Certainly.

975
01:44:29,085 --> 01:44:32,522
- But here you're poor.
- No, we're not poor.

976
01:44:32,885 --> 01:44:33,796
Come on.

977
01:44:34,005 --> 01:44:35,075
Oh yes.

978
01:44:35,285 --> 01:44:37,754
Below the minimum, with 3 kids.

979
01:44:54,645 --> 01:44:56,125
Good evening, Maria.

980
01:45:07,085 --> 01:45:08,644
When did it happen?

981
01:45:10,965 --> 01:45:13,525
I'll be there tomorrow.

982
01:45:46,165 --> 01:45:48,680
<i>Jonas disappeared
into a long night.</i>

983
01:45:50,165 --> 01:45:53,078
<i>He recalled some lines
of Borges...</i>

984
01:45:53,245 --> 01:45:56,522
<i>that Anziano had annotated
in his workshop.</i>

985
01:45:58,525 --> 01:46:03,600
<i>"Facts that disappear
when a person dies can amaze us."</i>

986
01:46:05,405 --> 01:46:10,480
<i>"But in every death, something,
or an infinite number of things, vanishes,</i>

987
01:46:11,725 --> 01:46:14,718
<i>unless the universe
itself has a memory."</i>

988
01:46:56,405 --> 01:47:00,797
<i>"On his last postcard, Anziano
wrote down a sentence by Karl Kraus...</i>

989
01:47:01,085 --> 01:47:04,761
<i>that I liked and that
made Jonas laugh a lot."</i>

990
01:47:05,725 --> 01:47:11,119
<i>"In art, eggs and fat are minimal."
"What counts is fire and a pan."</i>

991
01:47:42,765 --> 01:47:44,484
What happened?

992
01:47:45,845 --> 01:47:47,484
Do you know?

993
01:47:49,085 --> 01:47:50,121
Yes.

994
01:47:51,605 --> 01:47:53,597
At least, I think so.

995
01:47:54,965 --> 01:47:58,242
Lately, he'd been
very tired...

996
01:48:00,085 --> 01:48:01,644
and depressed.

997
01:48:03,405 --> 01:48:05,681
He went rather too far.

998
01:48:07,485 --> 01:48:08,805
Drugs?

999
01:48:11,685 --> 01:48:13,563
Let's say a combination of things.

1000
01:48:14,445 --> 01:48:16,482
He often went out again...

1001
01:48:17,405 --> 01:48:19,920
and therefore drank a lot.

1002
01:48:22,805 --> 01:48:24,876
Did he know what he was doing?

1003
01:48:25,365 --> 01:48:27,038
The risk he was taking?

1004
01:48:29,285 --> 01:48:30,844
Yes, I think so.

1005
01:48:32,685 --> 01:48:34,438
I think he knew.

1006
01:48:55,125 --> 01:48:58,436
You know, Jonas,
Anziano liked you a lot.

1007
01:48:59,365 --> 01:49:03,041
He really believed in you.
Don't let him down.

1008
01:49:03,325 --> 01:49:05,681
It's funny. I remember...

1009
01:49:07,285 --> 01:49:08,799
One day, he said...

1010
01:49:09,045 --> 01:49:11,765
the Europe-Afrika
axis would save the world.

1011
01:49:49,205 --> 01:49:51,003
You've begun to...

1012
01:49:51,925 --> 01:49:53,564
be a gourmet.

1013
01:50:00,845 --> 01:50:02,279
I'm not hungry.

1014
01:50:07,685 --> 01:50:09,642
It's no fun eating alone.

1015
01:50:11,685 --> 01:50:13,756
Did you go to the morgue?

1016
01:50:36,365 --> 01:50:39,915
<i>Jonas rang me up
before leaving Marseille.</i>

1017
01:50:40,565 --> 01:50:44,195
<i>He was sad. In addition,
the buffet had disappeared.</i>

1018
01:50:45,485 --> 01:50:47,363
<i>It was now a McDonald's.</i>

1019
01:50:48,405 --> 01:50:52,957
<i>Suddenly, he began to tell me
something strange about not doing...</i>

1020
01:50:53,245 --> 01:50:55,635
<i>"as if" but "like that".</i>

1021
01:50:56,725 --> 01:51:01,754
<i>In future he'd do it "like that".
I didn't know what to say.</i>

1022
01:51:02,365 --> 01:51:04,641
<i>He'd hung up in the meantime anyway.</i>

1023
01:51:26,925 --> 01:51:29,360
Your numbers for the horses...

1024
01:51:30,325 --> 01:51:32,885
were a hot tip.
The right combination.

1025
01:51:33,485 --> 01:51:34,965
You don't say.

1026
01:51:35,485 --> 01:51:37,044
That's terrific!

1027
01:51:38,445 --> 01:51:41,119
The trouble is that
I forgot to play.

1028
01:51:43,165 --> 01:51:44,724
Not very clever, eh?

1029
01:51:48,645 --> 01:51:50,443
What an idiot.

1030
01:51:51,045 --> 01:51:54,595
It doesn't matter. After all,
you said we play to lose.

1031
01:51:55,565 --> 01:51:58,034
But you owe me the 100 francs.

1032
01:52:14,885 --> 01:52:19,596
<i>In mid-May, it was
the "Ice Saints" and my birthday.</i>

1033
01:52:20,845 --> 01:52:25,317
<i>Jonas gave me some peonies
and a quotation from Renoir:</i>

1034
01:52:27,005 --> 01:52:29,600
<i>"For me, cinema and
water are inseperable."</i>

1035
01:52:30,365 --> 01:52:33,517
<i>"There is an inescapable
aspect in films...</i>

1036
01:52:33,765 --> 01:52:37,236
<i>that is related to streams
and the flow of rivers."</i>

1037
01:52:38,445 --> 01:52:42,155
<i>"This is a clumsy
description of a feeling,</i>

1038
01:52:42,845 --> 01:52:45,724
<i>for the cinema-river
connection is more...</i>

1039
01:52:45,925 --> 01:52:50,078
<i>subtle and powerful
because it remains inexplicable."</i>

1040
