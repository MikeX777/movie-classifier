00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:50,147

00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,708

00:03:13,059 --> 00:03:15,027
( police radio chatter )

7
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:27,132
( clock ticking )

00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,002

00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,852
( men shouting )

10
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,281
Mr. Dobson,

11
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,985
it's time for us to do what
the Good Lord would refer to

12
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,358
as a "cleansing of the wicked,"

13
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,227
and what my brother George,
God rest his soul,

14
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,029
used to call
"100% Alabama ass kickin'."

15
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:05,494
So you think we're gonna
die here today?

16
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:09,268
Dying's not an option.
Now, you stick that back

17
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,867
in that gray matter of yours
and you make that stick,

18
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:14,538
'cause any other thought's
gonna get you cold-slabbed,

19
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:18,311
toe-tagged and mailed home to your mom in
a plastic bag. Are we crystal?

20
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,648
- Crystal, sir.
- Gentlemen!

21
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,381
Let's do what
God made us to do.

22
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:30,024
- ( feedback )
- This is Sheriff John Quincey Wydell...

23
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:33,759
of the Ruggsville County
Sheriff's Department.

24
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,858
You're completely surrounded!

25
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,604
You have
no chance of escape!

26
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:44,376
Now would be the time
to vacate the premises peacefully.

27
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,342
There's a million
fucking cops!

28
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,247
Come on.

29
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,149
Otis, the fucking pigs
are everywhere!

30
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,848
- Tell me something I don't know!
- We've gotta do something!

31
00:05:56,923 --> 00:06:00,120
You're completely surrounded.
You have no chance of escape.

32
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,161
Can't take the car,
about 25 pigs.

33
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,594
I know, I know!
Shit fuck shit fuck!

34
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,495
Shit.
Where the fuck is Tiny?

35
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,363
- I ain't seen Tiny.
- Tiny!

36
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,267
- I think he went out last night.
- Everybody shut up!

37
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,242
- ( woman crying )
- Mama, what's the matter?

38
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:27,650
I keep thinking
about... old times...

39
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,848
Iike when you was
a fuckin' baby.

40
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:33,756
- You looked like an angel.
- I know, Mama.

41
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,818
- You told me that a million times.
- Yeah.

42
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,761
Gentlemen!

43
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,257
On the count of three!

44
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,496
- Ready?
- Yeah.

45
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,802
- One!
- I love you, Mama.

46
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,399
- I love you, Baby.
- Two!

47
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,845
Let's go.

48
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,715
Three!

49
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,520
- ( man screams )
- Fucking pigs!

50
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:17,034
Stupid motherfucker!

51
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,839
Die, you fuckers!

52
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,553
- You okay?!
- Yeah, are you?

53
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,816
Fuck!

54
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:45,022
- Ready?
- Yeah yeah yeah, go go!

55
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,203
Wydell:
Man down!

56
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,725
- Hold your fire!
- Men: Hold your fire!

57
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,887
Dobson! Get some tear-gas
in that house!

58
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,794
Sir!

59
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,711
( police radio chatter )

60
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,586
( muffled yelling )

61
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,460
Mama!

62
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,399
( muffled )
Let's go! Let's go!

63
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,040
Do not fucking move!

64
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,945
( gun cocks )

65
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:24,956
I advise you
to lower that weapon.

66
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:28,827
I'm sorry, Sheriff,

67
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,885
but you ain't gettin' me.

68
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,363
( clicks )

69
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,193
Looks like you ain't
gettin' off that easy,

70
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,236
huh, bitch?

71
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,431
( acoustic guitar playing )

72
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:57,545
* I've got to run
to keep from hiding *

73
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:02,253
* And I'm bound
to keep on ridin' *

74
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:07,857
* And I've got
one more silver dollar *

75
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:11,425
* But I'm not gonna
let them catch me, no *

76
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,907
* Not gonna let 'em
catch the midnight rider *

77
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:28,551
* I don't own
the clothes I'm wearing *

78
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:33,115
* And the road
goes on forever *

79
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:38,630
* And I've got one more
silver dollar *

80
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,428
* But I'm not gonna
let 'em catch me, no *

81
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,767
* Not gonna let 'em
catch the midnight rider *

82
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:37,086
* I've gone by the point of caring *

83
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:41,559
* Some old bed
I'll soon be sharing *

84
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:44,994
* And I've got one more *

85
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:47,123
* Silver dollar *

86
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:50,327
* But I'm not gonna
let 'em catch me, no *

87
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:54,771
* Not gonna let 'em
catch the midnight rider *

88
00:12:56,842 --> 00:13:01,108
* No, I'm not gonna
let 'em catch me, no *

89
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,378
* Not gonna let 'em
catch the midnight rider *

90
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,554

91
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:15,686
* I'm not gonna let 'em catch
the midnight rider *

92
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:19,396
* No, I'm not gonna

93
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,726
( radio chatter )

94
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,770
( men shouting )

95
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:26,805
Wydell:
All right, everybody listen up.

96
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,773
I want this place gone over
with a fine-tooth comb.

97
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:32,242
- ( sirens wailing )
- Wherever these fuckers are,

98
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,109
- they gotta be close.
- I am standing outside the perimeter

99
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,344
of what is turning out to be
the most horrific crime scene

100
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,681
since Jack the Ripper
stalked the streets of London.

101
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,221
What police have uncovered
reads like this--

102
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,258
words can't describe it--

103
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,657
"Human skulls
used as ornaments,

104
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:52,163
body parts stuffed
in refrigerators. "

105
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,358
And I can't believe
what it says here:

106
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,628
"A mass grave
of decomposing bodies

107
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,330
dumped under the crawlspace
of the house."

108
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,569
Hey, Chief, you might wanna
check this out.

109
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,614
- What?
- I don't know.

110
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,350
Jesus H Christ.

111
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,387
Motherfucker.

112
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,981
What, you recognize the clown?

113
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,992
Yeah, his name is Spaulding,

114
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,028
Captain fucking Spaulding.

115
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,225
Oh, yeah! Ooh, yes!
Gimme-- give it to me!

116
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,200
- Yeah.
- Yeah yeah.

117
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,793
Yeah, ride the horse, baby!
Ride it!

118
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,238
Ride it! Yeah yeah yeah.
( laughs )

119
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,578
God! Oh, yeah, honey.
Oh-ho!

120
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:42,580
- Give it to me.
- ( both laugh )

121
00:14:42,648 --> 00:14:44,809
- Oh, yeah. Yeah! Oh, yeah!
- You're the captain.

122
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,182
- Come on, baby.
- Yeah yeah yeah...

123
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,221
Oh, ride me, baby.
Ride it, ride it.

124
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,552
Ride it!
Feels so good!

125
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,092
Yeah! Yes, give it!
Give it up! Give it!

126
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,990
Give it, give it!
Yeah! Oh!

127
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,553
Come on, baby, ride it home!
Yeah yeah yeah...

128
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:01,793
- Yes! Yeah!
- Yeah, oh!

129
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,240
( climactic screaming )

130
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,885
Ah! Oh, honey!

131
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,717
You gettin'
a good ride tonight.

132
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:26,485
( both laughing )

133
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,584
Next time, you gonna
have to pay me.

134
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,589
Did you just call me
a fucking whore?

135
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,157
Well, I calls 'em
like I sees 'em.

136
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,203
Really?

137
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,033
You think I'm
a fucking whore?

138
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,266
I don't think it,
I know it.

139
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:48,673
- Whore this, fucker.
- Hey hey hey hey!

140
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,578
Come on now, baby,
hold on.

141
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:52,708
I'm just messing with ya.
You know us clowns,

142
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:56,915
we like to just fool around
a bunch, you know? Come on.

143
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:01,626
( giggling )

144
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,926
- ( chuckles ) Yeah.
- Laugh.

145
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,132
Clown... Iaugh!

146
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,659
- ( screams )
- ( radio blaring rock music )

147
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,438
Poopy.

148
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,498
( grunts )

149
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,635
What's the matter,
bad dream?

150
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,873
Yeah, 50-50.

151
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,915
You want to fool
around some more?

152
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,679
Oh, Jesus Christ, woman,
I gotta take a piss.

153
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:28,743
- No.
- Didn't you get enough ass-banging

154
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,847
Iast night?
God damn it, my dick is still sore.

155
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,949
- Oh, come on, I'm horny.
- No.

156
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,119
Most guys like
that quality in a girl.

157
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,163
( sighs )

158
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,825
Yeah, except you acting like some
kinda spastic mongoloid in heat.

159
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,136
( mocking laughter )

160
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,172
- ( mutters ) Fuckin' bitch.
- Hurry!

161
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,508
Spaulding: Ah...

162
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,912
Woman:
Where is it?

163
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,413
Just calm down,
it'll be on in a minute.

164
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,042
Ah! Ha ha!
There it is!

165
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,484
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

166
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,488
- Yeah.
- You look so sexy.

167
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:08,890
Captain Spaulding again. I'm here to
tell you about a brand-new attraction.

168
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:12,397
Mary... the monkey.
Oh yeah, that's right.

169
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,261
- Ha! That fuckin' monkey.
- This here little monkey

170
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,597
-...is half real human, half monkey...
- I love that monkey.

171
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,432
...I brought all the way
from the wilds of Borneo.

172
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:23,271
When y'all come in, make sure you bring
little Johnny and Suzie with you.

173
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,333
She'll scare
the holy guacamole out of 'em.

174
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,972
Ha ha! And remember
while you're down here,

175
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,949
pick up a "Captain Spaulding
for president" T-shirt

176
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,952
- all shapes and--
- ( theme music playing )

177
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,250
Hey, what the fuck is this?

178
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,449
I paid good money for
this goddamn commercial!

179
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,460
Sheriff, "News Update,"
what is the situation now?

180
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,258
- Wydell: The situation?
- ( phone ringing )

181
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,298
Now what?
God damn it!

182
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,668
- What are you--
- Yeah, what?

183
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,363
- Daddy, you gotta get outta there.
- Why?

184
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,566
- The pigs hit us this morning real bad.
- Shut the fuck up!

185
00:17:55,641 --> 00:18:00,305
- They're gonna be coming for you too.
- All right, just calm down.

186
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:04,213
I'll meet you at the Kahiki Palms Motel
just like we always planned.

187
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,514
- Yeah, okay.
- I'll be there as soon as I can.

188
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,554
All right,
just go now.

189
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:19,787
Woman: Poopy!

190
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,958
What do you need a gun for?
Where are we going?

191
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,298
- You ain't going nowhere, bitch.
- Oh, Poopy!

192
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,064
Get outta my fuckin' way!

193
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,596
If you're out there listening to this,
I got a message for ya.

194
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,337
I'm coming to get ya.
You can't run forever.

195
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,539
You're gonna have to stop
somewhere, sometime, and when you do

196
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,811
I'm gonna be there to put the wrath
of the Lord up your ass.

197
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,374
Woman:
Poopy, don't go!

198
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,852
God damn it,
stop calling me Poopy!

199
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,980
- But, Poopy--
- Leave me alone, woman!

200
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,252
- I want my Poopy! Poopy, no!
- Leave me alone!

201
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,670
In an attempt to help the Ruggsville
Police Department,

202
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,710
we here at "News Update"

203
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,405
would like to show you
these mug shots of the suspects

204
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,779
known to have escaped
during the raid earlier this morning.

205
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,818
( acoustic guitar playing )

206
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,727
* Mother *

207
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,390
* I fear
for the ladies *

208
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,971
* Ain't much more coal
to go down to *

209
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:42,576
* Ain't much more soul
to get around to. *

210
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:46,744
Man:
100. 1 50.

211
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,581
175.

212
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,221
184 bucks?
What?!

213
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,226
- Candy!
- What?

214
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,923
Candy, come on down here!
Come on, cut that out.

215
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,965
Turn it off.
Candy, come down here!

216
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:06,233
- Come on down here!
- All right. Shit.

217
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,273
What?

218
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,207
This is bullshit, baby!
What is this?

219
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:15,110
What do you want me to say?
It's a slow fuckin' night, boss.

220
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,149
All them farmers want is
a quickie hand job and boom!

221
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,651
( mocks gasping,
moaning )

222
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,891
10 dolla!

223
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:30,759
Get back on their tractors,
save the real fucking for the sheep.

224
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,923
Jesus, Candy, you gotta figure
a way to hook 'em in.

225
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,968
You gotta hustle
that pussy.

226
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:40,300
Find a new angle and you might
attract a higher clientele.

227
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,000
Yeah, well, I've been
thinking about that.

228
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:47,068
I was thinking about something spacey
like that "Star Wars" shit.

229
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,911
You know, them losers wanna
fuck Princess Leia, right?

230
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,951
I'd fuck her.

231
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,248
( gasps )
Thank you.

232
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,948
I don't know, you start messing
with that spacey shit,

233
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,218
and you'll really bring out
some sick bitches.

234
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,692
They all wanting
to pretend they're robots.

235
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:05,924
Last thing I need is horny robots
running around, tripping over shit.

236
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,364
Droids... boss,
they call 'em droids.

237
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,425
Whatever.
I still say it's risky.

238
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,904
( phone rings )

239
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,237
( high-pitched voice )
Wong's Hong Kong Gardens,

240
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:19,277
this is Mr. Wong speaking.

241
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,608
Cut the shit, Charlie.
It's me, Cutter.

242
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,547
I got a serious meltdown
going on down here

243
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,779
and I need a place to cool out,
so I'm coming down.

244
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:31,118
Fuck, man, I don't think it's such
a great idea, you coming around here.

245
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:34,124
I am coming down... now.

246
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,217
- Whoa, ho-- hold it!
- Fuck.

247
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,024
Hold it!

248
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,495
Fuck!

249
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:43,660
( engine buzzing )

250
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,321
Man, I don't see him.

251
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,151
Shit, where the fuck is he?

252
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,985
Jesus! Can we get
over this already?

253
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,655
I mean, I just don't
find it funny anymore.

254
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,994
I don't know,
it's still pretty funny.

255
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:16,899
- I'd say so.
- I hate to be the one

256
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:20,267
- to tell you I told you so--
- Then don't.

257
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,831
--but ridin' a mechanical bull
is not as easy as it looks.

258
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:26,537
Technically, she had
a pretty good ride...

259
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,772
until tragedy struck.

260
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,872
Man:
Hey, the lesson here is

261
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:35,215
that tube tops are not the proper attire
for bull riding, Glory.

262
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,879
I agree with you.

263
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,924
You gonna have to put a harness
on them little suckers, honey.

264
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:42,516
Her "tig bitties"
were flappin' around--

265
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:45,290
My titties don't flap!

266
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,629
They looked like two raccoons
in a gunnysack fighting to get out.

267
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,759
- Oh, Adam, shut up.
- When her top fell down,

268
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,770
I was gonna pee myself!

269
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,533
( mocking )
"l was gonna pee myself!"

270
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,074
You're just jealous
'cause you don't have any titties.

271
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,702
Oh, Gloria, come on,
no reason to get mean.

272
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,746
Come on, baby.

273
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,508
Man #2:
You had one titty going this way

274
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,983
and one titty going that way.
It was pretty amazing.

275
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,317
Chances are high you made
a few fans that night.

276
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,050
Oh, shut up, dipshit.

277
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,217
Well, I told Johnny Cash,
and he said--

278
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,090
did you know I shook hands
with Johnny Cash once?

279
00:23:17,162 --> 00:23:20,598
Roy, how about you go
find me the ice machine?

280
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:22,599
I need a drink.

281
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:26,125
I'll get you the ice, but you gotta
promise us an encore tomorrow.

282
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,172
Man #3: Roy!

283
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,970
You wish, honey.
Don't you wish.

284
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:33,033
The babes are
going into seclusion.

285
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,241
Man over radio:
The leader of this group who is

286
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:40,478
a local celebrity goes by the name
of Captain Spaulding

287
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,112
along with two other
suspects known as Otis--

288
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:45,179
Aw, shit fuck
shit fuck!

289
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,724
God, calm down.
Get rid of the car.

290
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,657
Don't worry,
I'll get us a room.

291
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,991
- Well, hurry the fuck up!
- Fuck you!

292
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:52,586
Fuck you!

293
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,624
Police revealed today
that they believe

294
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,465
most of the victims were drugged,
kidnapped and sexually assaulted.

295
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,403
God damn it! Fuck!

296
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:07,575
Hey, Roy, I was doing some research
on that thing I was telling you about.

297
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,546
- What thing?
- Rodeo clowning.

298
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,241
Rodeo...

299
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,050
A rodeo clown?
You been smoking dope.

300
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,754
Yeah-- I mean no,
not right now.

301
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,424
Let me tell you
something.

302
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:30,866
You spend one second in that pen
and that bulI'd have his horn

303
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:34,394
up your ass
and sticking out your pecker.

304
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,441
That's exactly what
I thought you'd say.

305
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:40,501
You know, you can never be supportive
of anything I wanna do.

306
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,376
What do you
want me to say?

307
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:45,416
That you're dressed for the part
and headed in the right direction?

308
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,452
Well, Adam was saying...

309
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,544
I've always been
good with animals.

310
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,589
I mean, dogs love me.

311
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,056
And isn't a horse
kinda like a big dog?

312
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:57,526
I don't know.

313
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,327
No, you're not
clown material.

314
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,733
Forget it. I'm gonna walk
on over to the gas station.

315
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,568
- You want anything?
- No-- yes.

316
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,165
Get me some
of that beef jerky.

317
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:13,211
Thanks for talking.

318
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,304
I could've been on that pit crew
down in North Carolina.

319
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,952
Yeah.

320
00:25:35,767 --> 00:25:38,235
Baby:
Meow! Meow.

321
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,271
Hey, pussycat.

322
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,974
Hey, got a light?

323
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:49,341
No, uh, I don't smoke.

324
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:53,373
My doctor says I got lungs
like a professional athlete.

325
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,442
Ah, I get it.
You wanna live forever.

326
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,488
Yeah yeah, well...

327
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,525
So what, are you on vacation
all by yourself or something?

328
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:05,052
Yeah-- no. I'm actually out here
with my singing group.

329
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,461
I do the lead singing for it.

330
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,328
It's called
"Banjo and Sullivan."

331
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,301
I used to sing with Johnny Cash.
He shook my hand.

332
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:14,202
I love famous people. They're so much
better than the real thing.

333
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:18,265
Well, yeah,
I suppose they are.

334
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,834
I bet all the girls
wanna fuck you.

335
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:28,410
- Would you say that again?
- I bet all the girls wanna fuck you.

336
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,454
( both laughing )

337
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,393
Do you kiss your mama
with that mouth?

338
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,897
Trust me, fella, that ain't
the only thing I do with this mouth.

339
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:42,331
Don't tell me that!
What? Say that again.

340
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,925
That I ain't the only thing
I do with this mouth.

341
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,971
- ( laughing )
- Man on TV: It's so depressing.

342
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,439
Let's talk about some of the symbols
of these groups

343
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,408
Iike the inverted cross
or the pentagram

344
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:55,412
or the number 666
left at the scene of the crime.

345
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,879
What do you
think about that?

346
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,718
This is not
an isolated incident.

347
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,693
Man #2: Well, members of these cults
realize they have no chance

348
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:12,753
of attacking God directly.

349
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:17,325
- So the next best thing...
- Adam, could you switch this?

350
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:21,805
- I can't stand to hear about this.
- What do I look like, Roy?

351
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,239
I'm Sullivan,

352
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,641
Roy Sullivan.

353
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,679
Well... Roy Sullivan.

354
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,910
You gonna take me
back to your room and play with me?

355
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,913
My wife's in that room.

356
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,749
Or is my brother
gonna have to shoot

357
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,516
your fucking teeth
out of your head?

358
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,859
Okay, let's go, Hoss.
Move it.

359
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:45,657
Gloria: Just makes me sick
to my stomach to think

360
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,858
that we live in a world
where there are Satanic cults.

361
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,026
Come on, Gloria,
it's a bunch of crap.

362
00:27:51,102 --> 00:27:53,570
- I don't know.
- Look at these two idiots.

363
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:57,005
They're just exaggerating all this shit
to try and kick up ratings.

364
00:27:57,075 --> 00:28:00,135
They wanna get people scared
so they stay at home,

365
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,611
buy TV dinners.
Fuck me running.

366
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,139
I don't know about that.
That business down in Ruggsville...

367
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,742
Ruggsville?
Ruggsville can kiss my ass.

368
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,152
Ain't nothing but a bunch
of local cousin-fuckers

369
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:13,156
corn-holing the livestock.

370
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:16,625
Could you just switch it
for me anyway, please?

371
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,131
Jesus Christ, I don't know
how Roy puts up with your shit.

372
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,367
What is taking Roy
so long, anyway?

373
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:29,601
- Adam: Hey!
- On the bed now!

374
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,370
- Get on the bed!
- Let me check my-- all right.

375
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,674
- Easy!
- What's going on here, Roy?

376
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,737
Shut up! Did I tell you
to fucking speak?

377
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,443
- Hey! Hey! Quiet! Quiet!
- Did I tell you you could talk?

378
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,179
Roy, what the hell is this?

379
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,847
- God damn it, look at that jacket.
- What?

380
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,754
On TV.

381
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:51,694
- Well, fuck the TV.
- Fuck the TV? Fuck you!

382
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,095
Will you keep your head
on the business at hand?

383
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,025
- Who's in the shower?
- That's my wife!

384
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,094
- God damn it!
- Don't fuck with.22.

385
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:03,607
What are you gonna do, man?
What the fuck are you gonna do?

386
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,700
I wanna know what the fuck
are you gonna do?

387
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,748
Adam:
Wendy!

388
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,215
- ( screaming )
- Get the fuck out of here!

389
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,490
Don't hurt her, please.

390
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,856
Is this everyone?

391
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,520
( knocks )

392
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,259
Hey, Roy. Open up.

393
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,961
I got some of that Dr. Corndog's
hickory-smoked jerky.

394
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,294
Who the fuck is that?

395
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:37,500
That's Jimmy.
He's our roadie.

396
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,702
- I forgot all about him.
- ( screams )

397
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,302
Baby, you all right?

398
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,508
Now I know
I can't trust you!

399
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,313
I'll get him.

400
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:52,083
- Hey.
- I'm sorry. I got the wrong room.

401
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,091
I'm looking for
room number two.

402
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,650
No, you got the right room.
Come on in.

403
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:00,596
- Is Roy in there?
- Roy's in here, all right. Come on in.

404
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:04,427
Get your ass in here!
On your knees!

405
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:05,992
Roy, help--

406
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:17,441
Shut up!

407
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,211
Woman over radio: We're at the scene
of a horrific multiple murder.

408
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,345
- No telling how many--
- God damn it!

409
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,218
- ( engine sputtering )
- Fuck!

410
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:27,554
Woman:...in the process
of recovering the corpses

411
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,957
which are in varying states
of decomposition.

412
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:33,395
It's currently being treated
as a sign of a mass homicide.

413
00:30:33,464 --> 00:30:36,262
- If initial figures prove--
- ( radio shuts off )

414
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,235
Come on, honey.
Mommy has to get to work.

415
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:42,535
If I'm late one more time,
Mr. McDonnell is gonna can my ass.

416
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,576
Boy: I am hurrying!
I dropped something.

417
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:47,076
Will you get in the car?!

418
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,976
Mom:
Okay, come on, let's go get in.

419
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,713
- Mom, a clown.
- Yeah yeah, a clown.

420
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:57,345
Oh-- hi.

421
00:30:57,422 --> 00:31:00,880
Hi. I'm gonna have to
be taking your car today.

422
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,052
See, I have some
top-secret clown business

423
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:06,392
that supersedes any plans that you
might have for this here vehicle.

424
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:09,991
- ( laughing )
- What's that about clown business?

425
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,332
Do I stutter, bitch?

426
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:19,342
Jamie, get in the car.
Lock the door.

427
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,810
Where the hell you going?
Damn it.

428
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,144
Don't you never turn your back
on a fucking clown

429
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,116
- when he's talking to you!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

430
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,093
What's the matter, kid?
Don't you like clowns?

431
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,356
( crying )

432
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,888
Why? Don't we
make you laugh?

433
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:46,835
Aren't we fucking funny?
You best come up with an answer

434
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,306
'cause I'm gonna come back here
and check on you and your mama.

435
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,173
If you ain't got a reason
why you hate clowns,

436
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,179
I'm gonna kill your
whole fucking family.

437
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,875
All right, now get
your fucking ass out the car!

438
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:00,747
Go on!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!

439
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:04,549
( laughs )
Shit! Woo!

440
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:17,361
Chinese, Japanese,
dirty knees, look at these.

441
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,630
( praying )

442
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:24,869
Chinese, Japanese,
dirty knees, look at these.

443
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,778
Chinese, Japanese,

444
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:32,077
dirty knees, look at these.

445
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:40,755
Hoss, are you staring
at my sister thinking bad thoughts?

446
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,952
No.

447
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:44,392
Why not? You a faggot?

448
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,157
No.

449
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,393
Well, what are you?
I mean, you got this hot piece of ass

450
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,401
shaking her shit right
in front of you

451
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:54,495
and you're not getting any ideas?
What do you call that?

452
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,164
I'm a married man.

453
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,765
A married fucking man.

454
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,606
Hey, that's just great!

455
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,647
Let's give him a big round
of applause, folks, for the married man!

456
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,706
- ( giggles )
- Come on!

457
00:33:05,783 --> 00:33:07,876
Woo! Married man!

458
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,920
All right. Wow.

459
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,354
Okay, Mama,
front and center, on your feet.

460
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,357
Don't hurt her.

461
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:17,258
Get on your feet.
Come on.

462
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,989
Let's go.

463
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,724
Please, mister,
this is insane.

464
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:23,358
Boy... the next word
that comes outta your mouth

465
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,925
better be some brilliant
fucking Mark Twain shit,

466
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,905
'cause it's definitely getting
chiseled on your tombstone.

467
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,377
Okay, come on, Mama.
Take that shit off,

468
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,812
Iet's see what's been holding Hoss's
balls at attention all these years.

469
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:39,679
What?

470
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:42,083
What? Take off your clothes,

471
00:33:42,153 --> 00:33:44,246
or one of these assholes
is going to die.

472
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,168
Come on, come on.

473
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,364
Shit, way to go, Roy!
She ain't too bad.

474
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,999
She got a tight
little ass on her!

475
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,945
And she got some
child-rearing hips.

476
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,513
Huh, yeah, hey.

477
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:15,916
Please don't hurt me.
Please don't hurt me.

478
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:19,479
Here, ooh, Jeez.
Roy, beginning to see what you mean.

479
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,491
Whoa.

480
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,356
Gloria:
Please don't hurt me.

481
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,022
( crying )

482
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,234
( crying, shuddering )

483
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,737
You like this, don't ya?

You like that, don't ya?
Say "Yes, I do."

486
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:42,413

487
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,053
Otis:
Yes, I do.

488
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,353
( gasps )
Yes, l-- I do.

489
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,732
Okay.

490
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,928
Okay, now.

491
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:07,266
Give me some sugar.
Make it sweet.

492
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:10,102
Don't want me to tense
up my trigger finger.

493
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:12,301
- ( gun hammer clicks )
- My finger's getting tense...

494
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:13,775
( groaning )

495
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,447
( groaning louder )

496
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:33,588
( Otis whispering ) I want you to say,
"You're the almighty devil,

497
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,962
and I want you to make me
my filthy whore."

498
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:39,434
Come on, say it.
I know it.

499
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,200
I know you're
feeling it. Say it.

500
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,298
You're... the...
almighty... devil

501
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:48,869
and I want you...
to make me your... fucking whore.

502
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:54,542
( gags,
crying hysterically )

503
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,212
( moans, screams )

504
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,828
( Otis laughs )

505
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:13,666
( laughing )
You make me sick.

506
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:15,968
Woo-hoo!

507
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,770
I feel like we're all really getting
to know each other now.

508
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,779
All right, ladies.
Me and the boys have an errand to run.

509
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,915
We'll be back
in a little while.

510
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,507
Come on, Hoss,
move it.

511
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,951
Come on, shit stain!
Gotta go!

512
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,989
Come on!
God damn it!

513
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,024
( news theme music playing )

514
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:37,492
Man on TV: Authorities struggle to
comprehend the grizzly remains found

515
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:41,123
in what is now being called the most
heinous crime in American history.

516
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,360
The group responsible
for these murders

517
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:46,870
is now being referred to as "The Devil's
Rejects" by the local media.

518
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,463
A woman known only
as "Mother Firefly"

519
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,474
was taken into
police custody today

520
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,067
after a violent
gun battle with police

521
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:57,137
that left four officers
dead and seven wounded.

522
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,012
I'm Derek Sanderson

523
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:01,074
bringing the world
to your doorstep.

524
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,621
Open the gate.

525
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,661
Ma'am...

526
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,763
my name is Sheriff
John Quincey Wydell.

527
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:26,966
Let's see
who we got here.

528
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,774
Miss Gloria Teasdale,

529
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,644
alias Eve Wilson,

530
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,707
alias Southern Betty Woods...

531
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:38,117
Betsy Woods.

532
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,214
And of course,

533
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,282
alias Mother Firefly.

534
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,658
You can read.

535
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,788
Congratulations.

536
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,128
Four counts,
grand theft auto.

537
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,168
Five counts,
armed robbery.

538
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,499
What's this?
Looks like your specialty...

539
00:37:56,574 --> 00:38:00,670
17 counts, solicitation
and prostitution.

540
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,412
You've been one busy whore.

541
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:08,281
I bet them old farmboys love you.

542
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:10,718
Everyone loves me.

543
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:13,815
Don't you pretend...

544
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,950
you don't fancy me.

545
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:18,928
Oh, yes, ma'am.

546
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:20,896
I find you quite irresistible.

547
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:24,024
- Dobson.
- Yes, sir.

548
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,264
- Put them books over there.
- Got it.

549
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,832
Ma'am, you recognize
these books, here?

550
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:36,847
Yeah.

551
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:41,010
Oh! Ain't she an angel?

552
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,521
Well, she gonna be one dead angel
when I catch up to her--

553
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,853
you, your whole clan,
you dead already.

554
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,258
You're just ghosts,
just waiting to expire.

555
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,957
The way I figure it,
only choice you got

556
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,829
is to cooperate
and tell me where they are.

557
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:59,392
That way your little
angel over there

558
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,405
don't have to die like no dog
in the streets when I catch her.

559
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:06,671
- Are you done trying to scare me?
- No, ma'am.

560
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,837
With God as my witness...

561
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,972
I have only just begun.

562
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,676
Oh... Sheriff...

563
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,742
can I show you something?

564
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,185
I'll need this book here.

565
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,225
I did never...

566
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:26,059
get around to putting these
in the book proper.

567
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,995
And I thought...

568
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,930
you might enjoy them.

569
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,059
Oh... you know...

570
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,263
he was a real sweetie pie.

571
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,774
Tall...

572
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,470
big moustache...

573
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,774
bald head...

574
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,577
You know,
I feel contrite

575
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,277
about blowing
his brains out,

576
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:52,379
'cause he seemed
like such a nice man.

577
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:55,619
I think...

578
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:59,629
he said... his name
was also Wydell.

579
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,200
Was he kin to you?

580
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,036
( gagging )

581
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,076
Listen to me,

582
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:15,544
- you gonna listen to me good.
- ( moaning, grunting )

583
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,638
I'm going to kill every
member of your family.

584
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:21,276
I am gonna hunt them down
like animals and skin 'em alive.

585
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:24,753
They are gonna feel the pain
and suffering of every last victim.

586
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:28,588
They're gonna crawl on their hands
and knees and beg me for mercy,

587
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:31,127
but all I'm gonna
have for 'em is pain.

588
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,822
- ( men shouting )
- You're dead!

589
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:36,162
( retching, gasping )

590
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:40,101
You go get 'em, Sheriff!

591
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:43,334
Go get your ghost!
Them ghosts is gonna

592
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:47,434
crawl right up
in your h-e-e-e-ead!

593
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:53,609
You found yourself into something
you ain't never getting out of!

594
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,811
( laughs maniacally )

595
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:58,650
We'll get ya!
We'll... get ya!

596
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:02,852
We'll get ya!
You're dead, Sheriff!

597
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,919
You're dead!
I'll see you

598
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:10,330
in fucking hell!

599
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,840
( country music playing )

600
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:33,348
* I must have been through
about a million girls *

601
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:38,259
* I love 'em
and I leave 'em alone *

602
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,663
* I didn't care *

603
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:46,066
* How much they cried,
those girls... *

604
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:49,804
Hey, Hoss,
you like this song?

605
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:56,808
( slowly )
Do you like this song?

606
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:01,710
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess so.

607
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,753
Oh, really?

608
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,312
- Which way?
- Take a right.

609
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:09,916
You like that Top 40 shit?

610
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,962
I thought you
were like some kinda

611
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:15,624
true-blue-balls-earnest-kill-'em
country fucker.

612
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,634
You're nothing but a city faggot
with a cowboy hat.

613
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,001
Stop here.

614
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:29,646
- ( engine stops )
- Otis: Okay, get out.

615
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,010
This way.

616
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,363
Follow the yellow brick road.

617
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:55,037
Otis:
That's right.

618
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,074
Go on.

619
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:07,249
( sniffs )

620
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,286
You know, Hoss,
if I'm not mistaken,

621
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:12,550
I think I can smell your wife's
pussy-stink on my gun.

622
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,559
Hope it doesn't rust the barrel.

623
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,464
Oh, man.

624
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:24,968
You know, the stress
of the day is really setting in on me.

625
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:30,300
You guys happen to know how a guy
like me could relieve some tension?

626
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:36,509
Ah, maybe-- I think
your wife Wendy, boy,

627
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,571
Iooks like she could
relieve some tension.

628
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,776
- Mister, where we going?
- Those little titties--

629
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,648
we're going down
the road here.

630
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,086
Those little titties,
she's got a tight little ass.

631
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,358
Does she like it
when you puke?

632
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,222
Is that part of your deal?

633
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,784
Where you taking us?

634
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,532
Well, I guess, it wouldn't
do no harm to tell you none.

635
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,468
We're gonna go dig up some guns
I buried out here a couple years ago.

636
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:03,370
- Then what?
- Well, there ain't no "what."

637
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,408
That's the end of the road.

638
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,667
( whispers )
What?

639
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,477
- You're not gonna kill us, are you?
- Killing sounds so permanent.

640
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:19,181
Adam: We did everything
you want, mister, just let us go.

641
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,019
Roy:
We did what you said.

642
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:25,425
First of all,
I didn't say anything.

643
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,589
And second of all,
I'm calling the shots!

644
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,758
Consider me fucking
Willy fucking Wonka!

645
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,028
This is my fucking chocolate factory!
You got it?!

646
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:33,797
My factory--

647
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:35,805
Adam:
Get him, Roy!

648
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,841
Get the gun, Roy!

649
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,531
Roy!

650
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,500
( screams )

651
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,274
( gagging )

652
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,954
Please, mister, stop.
Please.

653
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:00,956
- Stop.
- Stop?

654
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:03,584
Bitch, I have just started.

655
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,527
You know, I was gonna take
it easy on you, boy,

656
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,862
but you brought this
down on yourself.

657
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,198
You had to come
all fucking-big-stick- walking-tall

658
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,398
Iike a big, fucking hero!
You got yourself to blame.

659
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:19,340
Look at you now, hero!
You're gonna fucking bleed to death.

660
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,377
Fuck you!

661
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:25,975
That's what they all say,
"Fuck you!"

662
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:29,246
Well, it ain't gonna save ya.
It don't scare me none

663
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:32,015
- and don't make you a hero!
- ( thuds )

664
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:39,218
Wanna see what happens
to heroes, boy?

665
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,754
You wanna see bad-ass, motherfucker?
I'll show you bad-ass!

666
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,429
( screaming ) Roy!

667
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,269
Roy!

668
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,536
Hoss, I want you
to pray to your God.

669
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:56,443
I want you to pray that
He comes and saves you.

670
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,346
I want lightning to come down
and crash upon my fucking head!

671
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:03,352
- I pray... Jesus...
- Louder!

672
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,186
Bless the bunnies,
bless the little birds--

673
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:11,057
- I don't feel anything.
- --bless the springtime morning.

674
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:14,655
( gasping, moaning )
I feel it!

675
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:18,189
Oh, Great God Almighty,
I repent, I repent!

676
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,930
I feel the love
of the God-God-God Almighty!

677
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,235
Oh, the Holy Spirit
is in my body!

678
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,118
I am the devil, and I am here
to do the devil's work.

679
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:41,791
( screaming maniacally )

680
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,487
Roy! Roy!

681
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:52,964
Roy! Roy!

682
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:03,106
You fucking motherfucker!

683
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,842
You fucking motherfucker!
Son of a bitch!

684
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:09,010
I've got other
plans for you... hero.

685
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:17,785
* Well... *

686
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,863
* I can't quit you, baby *

687
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:24,196
* But I gotta put
you down for a while... *

688
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,236
( blues continues
playing on TV )

689
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,432
( humming )

690
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:34,204
* Well, you know,
I can't quit you, baby *

691
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:40,214
* But I gotta put you
down for a while... *

692
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,582
Shut the fuck up!

693
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:49,558
* Yes, you messed up
my happy home, baby... *

694
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:53,187
Can I go to the bathroom, please?
I'm about to piss myself.

695
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:56,460
* You made me mistreat
my only child... *

696
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,364
Excuse me...

697
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,503
Can she go to
the bathroom? Please?

698
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:06,099
What?! I heard you the first time.
I was just thinking.

699
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:08,007
What are you
gonna do for me?

700
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,876
- What?
- Go piss yourself for all I care.

701
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,644
If you want special favors, you gotta
give me something in return.

702
00:49:13,717 --> 00:49:15,685
What do you want?

703
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,992
I want you
to hit her in the face.

704
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,961
- What?
- I know you heard me.

705
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,435
Go ahead.

706
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,872
Baby:
Go on.

707
00:49:37,774 --> 00:49:39,366
Make it hurt,
no love taps.

708
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:41,411
I want to hear it.

709
00:49:47,117 --> 00:49:49,312
Harder, she ain't gonna break.

710
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,752
* You know it
hurts me deep... *

711
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,296
( grunts )

712
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,460
You better make this
next one fucking count!

713
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:09,969
* Yes, when you hear me
moaning and groaning, baby *

714
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:15,409
* Oh, you know, it hurts
me deep down inside... *

715
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:17,743
- Ah!
- ( laughs )

716
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:19,975
Good, very nice.

717
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,018
Now you come here.

718
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,188
Right here.
Kneel down.

719
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:32,090
Give me a kiss and say, "Thank you,
Baby, I'm having a great time."

720
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,995
Thanks, Baby,
I had a really good time.

721
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,535
Now make it fast, bitch!

722
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:44,165
Don't try anything cute!

723
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,542
( whispers ) Shit!

724
00:50:58,021 --> 00:50:59,545
Now, what do you
want to do?

725
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:04,326
( industrial music playing )

726
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:09,623
( screaming hysterically )

727
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,133
Damn it, I knew that cunt
would do something stupid.

728
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:14,864
Shut up!
Open the fucking door!

729
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:17,907
- Open the goddamn door!
- Okay! Hold it!

730
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:27,178
Somebody help me!

731
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,378
What are you
gonna do, shoot me?

732
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,513
What did I ever
really do to you?

733
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,491
I swear I'll do it.
I'll kill you.

734
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,494
Why would you
want to kill me?

735
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,689
I'm you're only hope,
my brother's fucking crazy.

736
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,460
- Wendy: Please!
- Wendy, it's all right!

737
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,160
Come on out--
( grunts )

738
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,426
Go ahead, shoot me.
Shoot me right in the ass!

739
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:16,257
( clicks )

740
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,858
Stupid cunt!
Ain't no bullets in this thing.

741
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,596
It's all fucking mind power.

742
00:52:48,698 --> 00:52:51,895
( screaming )
Somebody, help! Somebody, please!

743
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:55,734
Help! Help! Help!

744
00:52:56,873 --> 00:53:00,172
Help me! Help me!

745
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:09,752
Oh, God. Help me!

746
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,078
- Whoa whoa, darling.
- She's crazy!

747
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:14,589
Daddy, grab that bitch!

748
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,095
( siren wailing
in distance )

749
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,909
Hey, Chief,
I think I got something.

750
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,918
What?

751
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:44,886
This Captain Spaulding guy,

752
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,753
Captain Spaulding's
a character from "Animal Crackers,"

753
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,758
a Marx Brothers' movie.

754
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:52,090
I'll be damned.

755
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:53,891
Think it means anything?

756
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,932
I don't know.

757
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:01,526
Tell you what, you get that
movie critic over here. What's his name?

758
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:03,368
- Marty Walker?
- Yeah, that's him.

759
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,965
Tell him to get his ass
over here as soon as he can.

760
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:09,409
Tell him to bring whatever information
he's got about the Marx Brothers,

761
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:11,640
particularly characters
Groucho played in his movies.

762
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,683
All right,
I'll get right on it.

763
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:17,009
This shit's just getting
weirder and weirder.

764
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,830
Shit, Daddy, I didn't
think you were coming.

765
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,331
I'm cool.

766
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,002
Where the fuck is Otis?

767
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,800
Not back from
getting the guns yet.

768
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,568
You wanna fuck with me?
Huh, bitch?

769
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,633
- ( gasping )
- You ain't got what it takes.

770
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,611
He fucks this up,
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.

771
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,138
You believe this bitch had the balls
to try and fuck with me?

772
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:53,319
Cox, nice of you to make it.
Enjoying your meal?

773
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:55,381
What? I gotta eat.

774
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,586
My blood sugar gets off,
I'm not gonna be any good to anybody.

775
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,755
Ya ain't no good
to nobody anyhow.

776
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,458
Listen here, that movie expert
guy's here. Wanna talk to him?

777
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,433
Want me
to bring him in?

778
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:09,102
All right, all right,
I'll get him right now.

779
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,606
Mr. Walker?
Come on in, please.

780
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,233
Sheriff Wydell,
it's a pleasure.

781
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,938
I rushed right over
as soon as I got your call.

782
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:18,071
You came to the right man.

783
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,811
I happen to be a self-proclaimed
Marx Brothers expert if I say so myself.

784
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:24,513
I'm sure your knowledge
of bullshit is limitless.

785
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:27,283
Why don't we get to the point?
What do you got for me?

786
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:28,984
I got a fucking
grocery list for you

787
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:32,051
of all the major Marx Brothers
characters and related characters,

788
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:35,529
and I made a secondary list of any
and all films having to do with Groucho,

789
00:55:35,598 --> 00:55:38,158
including such gems as
"A Girl in Every Port," and "Skidoo,"

790
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:42,000
where Groucho played the part of God...
( chuckles )

791
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:45,439
directed by Otto Preminger,
who happened to be Jewish,

792
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,568
although he played a Nazi commandant
in "Stalag 17" directed by Billy Wilder.

793
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,772
Otto Preminger also
directed "Exodus,"

794
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,838
and it's rumored
that at the premiere

795
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:55,407
Mort Sahl stood up,
yelled at the screen,

796
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:59,182
- "Otto! Let my people go!"
- Give me the damn list.

797
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:02,520
It's ironic, don't ya think?
Nazi, State of lsrael?

798
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:06,084
They're all here,
all the aliases--

799
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:08,528
"Rufus Firefly,
Otis Driftwood,

800
00:56:08,598 --> 00:56:10,532
Captain Spaulding"--
all of 'em.

801
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,627
Hey, Chief, I'm thinking we ought to
track down this Groucho Marx guy,

802
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:16,899
ask him a few questions,
maybe he's involved.

803
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,908
Idiot, he died last year.
He died, didn't he?

804
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,171
Oh God damn it.
God damn it, see?

805
00:56:22,245 --> 00:56:25,476
That right there is one sad,
pathetic state of cinematic affairs.

806
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,413
If you weren't a cop,
I'd wring your neck.

807
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:30,214
Hey, let's take
that down a notch.

808
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,277
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

809
00:56:32,355 --> 00:56:36,985
This sneering, rotating,
gyrating pelvis son of a bitch,

810
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,324
he died three days
before Groucho,

811
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,125
stole all
the goddamn headlines.

812
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,994
That goddamn, fucking
Elvis Presley.

813
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,125
What did you say
about The King?

814
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,294
He died three
days before Grouch--

815
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,066
You ever say another derogatory word

816
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,007
about Elvis Aaron Presley
in my presence again,

817
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,476
I will kick
the living shit out of you!

818
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:58,776
You get this Hollywood-loving
pussy out of my face.

819
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:01,146
- Elvis is in Hollywood!
- Get the hell outta here!

820
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:02,844
- His first film...
- Get out!

821
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:05,444
..."Love Me Tender,"
was based on an lrish folk song!

822
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,490
Fuck Groucho!

823
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,560
( Wendy crying )

824
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,536
( sighs )

825
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:35,442
Ha!

826
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:38,043
Booga booga booga booga
booga booga booga booga!

827
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,784
- ( laughing )
- Don't you fucking knock?

828
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:44,656
- Where the fuck you been?
- Did you get everything?

829
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:47,195
Oh, yeah, I got everything.

830
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:52,623
You, motherfucker!
Where the fuck have you been?

831
00:57:52,702 --> 00:57:55,933
Hey! You got a problem
with my time-frame, son,

832
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,996
you best spit
it out right now.

833
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:01,475
Yeah, I got a problem.
I got a big fucking problem, bozo!

834
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:04,570
Well, make your move,
laddie, two hits.

835
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,275
I hit you and your dick
hits the fucking dirt.

836
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,319
Old man, you ain't
hitting nothing!

837
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:18,623
Hey, cut the shit, we gotta
get the fuck outta here.

838
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:21,630
What are we gonna
do with this one?

839
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:25,459
Leave her for
a maid to clean up.

840
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,873
I got a better idea.

841
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:34,470
( Baby laughs )

842
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:37,035
( whimpering )

843
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,179
- ( screaming )
- We regret to inform you

844
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:50,090
that the "Banjo and Sullivan Show"
will be canceled tonight.

845
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,829
Fuck.

846
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,003
No, please!

847
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,639
Housekeeping.

848
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,877
Housekeeping!

849
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,086
Ay, Julio.

850
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,325
( sighs )

851
00:59:57,393 --> 01:00:01,329
( speaking Spanish )

852
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,661
( muttering )

853
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,680
( muffled screaming )

854
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,465
( brakes squeal )

855
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:19,333
( sirens wailing,
police radios chattering )

856
01:01:51,674 --> 01:01:55,405
Jesus Christ.
What a fucking mess.

857
01:01:57,346 --> 01:02:00,008
Wydell: 40-ton truck has
a tendency of doing that, Kenny.

858
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:03,951
Listen, you mind getting one
of your donut brigade to go over there

859
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,181
and scoop up some
of that skull matter?

860
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:08,314
Put it in a bag
for the meds.

861
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,018
Yeah, you got it.

862
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,027
Is that the lady
who found her?

863
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:14,222
Yeah, the maid.

864
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:16,231
That's Maria Gomez.

865
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,233
She say anything?

866
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:20,235
Yeah, a lot of things.

867
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,237
But I don't
speaka no Spanish.

868
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:24,136
It's all mumbo jumbo to me.

869
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:27,370
Shit, what am l,
the mayor of Tijuana?

870
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:30,378
( chuckling )
Got one guy,

871
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:32,414
Clarks, he speaks Spanish,

872
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,416
but he called in sick

873
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:37,385
from what he calls
"explosive diarrhea."

874
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:41,617
You mind sparing me any further details
about your deputy's asshole, Kenny?

875
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,395
Señorita Gomez?

876
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:50,756
( speaking Spanish )

877
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:04,877
- No.
- What'd I tell ya?

878
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:06,881
She's useless.

879
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,747
Chief, got a couple
shit-kickers over there,

880
01:03:09,819 --> 01:03:11,514
says they're here
to meet you.

881
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,555
- Recognize those guys?
- Yeah, I know 'em.

882
01:03:15,558 --> 01:03:17,526
( speaking Spanish )

883
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,860
- What's going on, shitheads?
- Sheriff.

884
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:34,943
Here's the list of names I need you
to run down for me.

885
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:37,411
That's a funny-ass name.
( chuckling )

886
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,005
Look who's
fucking talking, Rondo.

887
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,243
Just call me
if anything connects.

888
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,286
I'm sure it will.

889
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,649
Shit always floats
our way, don't it?

890
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:49,486
Chief.

891
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:53,256
You keep your mouth open wide enough,
maybe you'd catch it all.

892
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,695
Don't fuck this up, assholes.

893
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:58,233
Have fun scraping all them
brains up off the road.

894
01:03:58,301 --> 01:04:00,531
See ya later, Kenny.

895
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:02,571
( rock music playing )

896
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:14,549
This is bullshit. I trust that fucker
Charlie about as much as I trust you.

897
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:17,177
Where the hell you get off
talking shit about Charlie?

898
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:20,711
Hey, I know what I know,
and I know I don't like that nut sack.

899
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,724
Well, unless you got
a better suggestion,

900
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:25,556
I suggest you keep
your fucking pie hole shut.

901
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:28,597
That is the only
remotely safe place I know about.

902
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,300
Hey, man,
if anyone's interested,

903
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:34,962
I think I'm gonna be wanting
some ice cream in about 10 miles.

904
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,096
( mocking )
"Hey man, think I'm gonna be wanting

905
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,663
some ice cream in about 10 miles."

906
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:40,766
Don't you fucking imitate me!
It's fucking rude!

907
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:43,539
( mocking ) "l know what I know
and I know I don't like that nut sack."

908
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:45,308
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

909
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:47,849
Two fucking seconds for the kids,
is that gonna kill you?

910
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:49,851
Yes, it is gonna kill me.

911
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,183
I have calculated the time
and two seconds is

912
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:55,281
the exact amount of time
that's a hazard to my fucking health!

913
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:58,088
Come on, don't be
such a fucking drag, I'm starving.

914
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,991
Hey, eat this.

915
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:03,429
What is your fucking problem?
I'm in and out in two seconds.

916
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:07,094
I think I'm gonna get me
tutti-fucking-fruity.

917
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:09,831
Tutti-fucking-fruity,
that sounds good.

918
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,874
Both:
Tutti-fucking-fruity!

919
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:14,739
- Shut up!
- Tutti-fucking-fruity!

920
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:17,608
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Tutti-fucking-fruity!

921
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,648
Tutti-fucking-fruity!

922
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:24,015
There is no fucking ice cream
in your fucking future.

923
01:05:25,788 --> 01:05:28,313
* I know
where you're going *

924
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,518
* I don't think
that's acting right *

925
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,892
* You don't think
it's showing... *

926
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,830
Mm, dee-licious!

927
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:43,036
I don't know why you have to be
such a grouch. This is really good.

928
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,198
Here, have some.

929
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,468
Fuck you.

930
01:05:46,542 --> 01:05:49,170
( Baby, Spaulding laughing )

931
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:53,481
Tutti-fucking-fruity!

932
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:40,926
Man:
Hey, piggy...

933
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,295
Yeah, over here, come on.
( snorts )

934
01:06:43,366 --> 01:06:45,800
Come and get it.
( laughing )

935
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:49,099
Yes, Mr. Wy-fucking-dell.

936
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:53,232
Piggy, come over here
and get some. ( snorting )

937
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:55,243
( clicks )

938
01:06:55,311 --> 01:06:57,609
Don't fucking move, clown.

939
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,648
You looking for somebody?

940
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:02,475
( clicks )

941
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,754
Wydell:
George?

942
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,790
What the hell you doing
down here, George?

943
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,954
I live here now.

944
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:16,465
No. You got that
all wrong, George.

945
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,864
I mean,
this ain't your home.

946
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:21,494
I got no choice, Johnny.

947
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:24,706
This here is my fate.

948
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:28,471
I cannot rest until
this whole thing is over.

949
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:30,978
And I'm asking you,
brother...

950
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,942
kill 'em, John.
End this shit now.

951
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:38,350
I'm-I'm walking the line on this,
brother. I'm walking the line.

952
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:43,415
Well, Mother pin a rose on me.

953
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:45,289
That is so great.

954
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:48,524
( chuckles )
I want these motherfuckers dead!

955
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,428
- Kill 'em!
- ( phone ringing )

956
01:07:50,499 --> 01:07:52,330
I'm sorry, George.

957
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:04,578
- Yeah?
- Hey, I think I found your guy.

958
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:07,445
Yeah, a friend of mine,
about 10 years ago,

959
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:09,882
he used to buy hooch
from this guy out here.

960
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:11,078
Mm-hmm.

961
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:16,386
Went by the name
of Wolf J Flywheel.

962
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:19,917
Yeah, but-but his partner
called himself "The Captain."

963
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:23,658
Sounds like the fuckers
we're looking for, huh?

964
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:27,031
Yeah, Wolf J Flywheel.
That name's on the list.

965
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,503
Apparently,
now Wolf J

966
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:32,700
goes by the name
of Charlie Altamont.

967
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:37,775
All right, good.
You know what to do.

968
01:08:37,847 --> 01:08:41,214
( chuckles )
We wouldn't be talking if I didn't.

969
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,348
So is the shit on?

970
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,355
The shit is on.

971
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:49,186
Fucking A.

972
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:55,130
( footsteps approaching )

973
01:08:56,332 --> 01:08:58,300
Open the door, Deputy.

974
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:05,666
Take the night off, Freddy.
I'll watch the prisoner.

975
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:11,879
Well well well,

976
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:15,508
working late tonight,
aren't we, Sheriff?

977
01:09:16,552 --> 01:09:18,213
What's the matter?

978
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:22,189
Can't sleep?
Hell running loose in the streets?

979
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:25,193
Or did ya
just miss Mama?

980
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:31,066
As a matter of fact,
I was feeling kinda lonely.

981
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:33,761
( chuckles )

982
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,430
I knew you couldn't
stay away.

983
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,473
I got that
power over men.

984
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:43,269
Women like me
are a rare breed.

985
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:45,074
Don't you agree?

986
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,274
Oh, yes, ma'am, I do.

987
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,317
I ain't been broken,
you know.

988
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:52,420
Men like that.

989
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:59,083
Ooh, you got me going
this afternoon.

990
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:01,721
You think you
can break me?

991
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:04,664
You like it rough?

992
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:12,138
Oh, honey, you can have it
any way you want.

993
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,176
I don't want it rough.

994
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:19,414
Oh! ( grunts )

995
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,612
I like it hot...

996
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,619
and slow.

997
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:27,315
Hot...

998
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,687
- and slow.
- Mmm.

999
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:31,692
- Hot... and slow.
- Mmm.

1000
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,923
( panting )
Yeah.

1001
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:36,965
( sloshes )

1002
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:40,635
( retching, gasping )

1003
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:44,972
- You like that, Mama?
- Oh, yeah.

1004
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,008
You like that, Mama?

1005
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:52,781
I--

1006
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,510
Yeah.

1007
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,565
( knife clangs )

1008
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,200
( slow funk playing )

1009
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:36,149
* Ooh *

1010
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,897
* Shoo *

1011
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,526
* Hey, kid, rock and roll *

1012
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:48,035
* Rock on *

1013
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:50,697
* Ooh, my soul, hey, kid *

1014
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:52,741
* Boogy too, did ya? *

1015
01:11:56,912 --> 01:11:58,937
Check this place out.

1016
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,814
Whoa.

1017
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:08,482
I know that ain't Cutter walking
towards me with that stupid grin.

1018
01:12:08,557 --> 01:12:12,653
'Cause I know I swore
if I ever saw that dumb-cunt-

1019
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,822
no-good-piece-of-shit-
motherfucking brother of mine,

1020
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:20,164
he'd soon be a dead piece- of-shit-
no-good-motherfucking brother of mine.

1021
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:22,362
Okay, everybody
in the peanut gallery,

1022
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:24,998
Simon says hands up.

1023
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:27,440
He said put
your fucking hands up!

1024
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,875
What the fuck
is this shit?

1025
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,938
You bring us all the way out here
and this prick pulls a gun on us?

1026
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:38,009
- Nice fucking plan, daisy.
- Just do it!

1027
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:41,420
- He's a crazy pig-fucking son--
- What'd you call me?!

1028
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:43,856
Well, if you
give me a chance,

1029
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:48,420
I was gonna call you a crazy-pig-
fucking-dumb-ass-pussy piece of shit.

1030
01:12:48,497 --> 01:12:51,022
Oh, brother,
you's a dead man.

1031
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:56,137
( laughing )

1032
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:04,544
Ain't that the most goddamn
realest water gun you ever did see?

1033
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:09,778
Oh, shit!
That was great, man.

1034
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:13,913
Sorry about that, it's just a little game we
used to always play on folks.

1035
01:13:13,989 --> 01:13:15,786
- And it still works!
- Hell, yeah.

1036
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:19,294
- That's a fucking hoot.
- Johnny, this is my daughter, Baby.

1037
01:13:19,361 --> 01:13:21,886
- My niece?
- Yes!

1038
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:24,364
You all grown up.
Give me some love!

1039
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:27,665
And you remember
happy boy here.

1040
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:30,830
Are you still an asshole?

1041
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:35,275
This is Casey,
my most limber lady.

1042
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:36,902
And this is Candy,
my special lady

1043
01:13:36,979 --> 01:13:40,779
and my... top-earning gal.

1044
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:42,783
What you looking at?

1045
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:46,582
- I'm looking at you, mama.
- You see something you like?

1046
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:49,818
Maybe. I set my standards low
so I'm never disappointed.

1047
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:52,918
Oh, well,
I don't disappoint.

1048
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:54,963
Ooh...

1049
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:58,090
Fuck, let's go inside.

1050
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:00,192
No sense standing
around like--

1051
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:03,238
stone-foot roosters
in a fuck farm!

1052
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,906
- Let's celebrate.
- Oh, yeah.

1053
01:14:07,976 --> 01:14:10,240
( rock music playing )

1054
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,934
* Spent the last year *

1055
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:36,493
* Rocky mountain way... *

1056
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:39,268
( snickers )

1057
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:41,275
You know,
I gotta tell ya,

1058
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:45,336
that is some catch-phrase
you got there.

1059
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:46,711
"Devil's Rejects."

1060
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:49,615
* And we don't
need the ladies *

1061
01:14:49,685 --> 01:14:54,122
* Crying 'cause
the story's sad... *

1062
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,384
You got something
to say to me, clown?

1063
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:58,619
Huh?

1064
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:00,685
I bet you scare
lots of folks, don't ya?

1065
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:05,324
* Telling us that
changes it every day *

1066
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:09,461
* Says it doesn't matter... *

1067
01:15:09,538 --> 01:15:12,473
Yeah, you're a regular,
fucking killer.

1068
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:17,676
You want a piece of this, motherfucker?
You want a piece of this?!

1069
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:20,874
Huh? What you got?!
What you got?!

1070
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:24,077
( silent )

1071
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:35,390
Lord, I am
Your arm of justice.

1072
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:38,592
Lord, I am Your
arm of justice.

1073
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,601
Lord...

1074
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:43,433
I am Your arm of justice,

1075
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:45,473
Your righteous sword
of vengeance.

1076
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:49,708
Let my blows be true.

1077
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:55,749
( blues guitar playing )

1078
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:01,818
Oh, yeah,
Lord have mercy!

1079
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,653
What a morning.

1080
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,488
- Clevon!
- Yeah, boss.

1081
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,997
You know why I come here
to get these chickens?

1082
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,622
No, boss.

1083
01:16:10,699 --> 01:16:13,668
'Cause my brother makes
the best fried chicken in the world.

1084
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,168
Clevon:
is that right?

1085
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:17,205
Good morning, good morning, sir!
How are you?

1086
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:19,035
How y'all doing?
Good morning.

1087
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:21,268
Good good good.
What ya got for me?

1088
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:23,971
We got these real cute
barred rock chickens here.

1089
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:27,106
- Yeah, I see it.
- Got them nice, long-legged...

1090
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:29,650
- Rhode lsland red chickens.
- Rhode lsland red!

1091
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:31,652
- Yeah.
- Oh, I like them!

1092
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,314
I want a Rhode lsland red
for me, all right?

1093
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:36,857
- Two of 'em. Yeah.
- Rhode lsland red, two?

1094
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:41,356
Now, y'all ain't planning on fucking
these chickens, are you?

1095
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:49,860
What the fuck are
you getting at?

1096
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,906
Do you fuck chickens?

1097
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:57,173
( chuckles ) Well, I have thought
about fucking some chickens before.

1098
01:16:57,245 --> 01:17:00,737
If you want to have a good time
and you need some pussy,

1099
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:02,716
you can cut
that chicken's head off

1100
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:05,412
and stick your dick
in that ass of that chicken,

1101
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:10,083
and that damn chicken'll go crazy
on your ass and go... ( squawks )

1102
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:14,356
Are you saying that I would cut off
a chicken's head, put my dick in it,

1103
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:18,092
fuck it
and go "Aaahhh"?

1104
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:21,033
You accusing me of fucking
a chicken, motherfucker?

1105
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:23,196
No, I ain't call you
a chicken fucker, but...

1106
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:25,466
boy over there looks
sexually frustrated and...

1107
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,508
I don't approve
of chicken fucking.

1108
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:30,374
- You hear what he called me, boss?
- My mistake.

1109
01:17:30,445 --> 01:17:32,072
He called me
a fucking chicken fucker!

1110
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:34,945
Go back and grab
the fucking chickens, Clevon.

1111
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:37,281
( muttering )

1112
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:39,877
- Here's five.
- Appreciate it, thank y'all.

1113
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:41,354
He's a chicken fucker!

1114
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:43,357
That's all right,
put it back there.

1115
01:17:43,425 --> 01:17:45,290
Next time, we go
someplace else.

1116
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,624
We ain't never buying
chickens from him again, boss!

1117
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,823
I know, I know.

1118
01:17:49,898 --> 01:17:51,866
You inbred! Inbred!

1119
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:04,909
Wolf J Flywheel?

1120
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:09,274
Get your motherfucking
pimp ass over here now.

1121
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,720
Who are you talking about, man?
Who you talking to?

1122
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:21,192
What's going on, Sheriff?
What'd we do?

1123
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:23,231
( snickers )
What's going on, baby?

1124
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,400
You and me,
we're gonna have a little powwow

1125
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,096
about a certain Captain Spaulding

1126
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:31,799
and his merry band
of assholes.

1127
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:36,808
- Captain who?
- You know what I'm talking about,

1128
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:38,846
am I correct?

1129
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:43,381
Hey, Sheriff...
not in the middle of the street.

1130
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:45,647
Ain't no sense
in getting crazy out here.

1131
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,983
I don't like no motherfuckers
playing dumb with me.

1132
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:53,926
Now, let me tell you
the way it's gonna go down.

1133
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:56,327
You're gonna make sure
all three of them dirtbags

1134
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:59,367
are present and accounted
for tonight at midnight. You got me?

1135
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:03,165
You understand me?
Charlie! You got me?

1136
01:19:10,946 --> 01:19:13,176
What if I say no?

1137
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:16,376
Then I ought to shoot your ass
right fucking here and now,

1138
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:18,316
you and that other
ugly motherfucker.

1139
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:21,014
And I'm gonna forget this
conversation ever happened.

1140
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:24,422
Tonight, midnight.

1141
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:31,327
It's a bad day to fuck
with me, Charlie boy.

1142
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:33,264
( engine starts )

1143
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:42,372
( rock music playing )

1144
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:52,477
Billy Ray:
Hey, we got you this far. Shit.

1145
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:56,183
Without us, you'd still be swimming
around with your head up your ass.

1146
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:58,351
( all laughing )

1147
01:19:58,426 --> 01:20:01,657
Hey, Chief, don't sweat it.
Have a beer.

1148
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:04,426
It's all going to work out
to your satisfaction.

1149
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:08,833
If I were you, I'd put the beer down
and keep your mind on business

1150
01:20:08,904 --> 01:20:11,498
before business jumps up
and bites you right in the ass.

1151
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,541
Don't worry
about me, boss.

1152
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:16,270
They'll think goddamn King Kong
came down from Skull lsland

1153
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:19,370
and raped them
a new fucking asshole.

1154
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:22,814
Hey, man, don't give me
none of that cocky-ass-

1155
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:27,378
yard-bird-pumping-iron-I'm-the-baddest-
motherfucker-that-ever-lived horseshit.

1156
01:20:27,455 --> 01:20:30,322
That might work on some Johnny
Redneck bail jumper,

1157
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,189
but that don't
mean shit to me.

1158
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:34,592
Then I suggest
you pick up the bat phone

1159
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,324
and call some
new motherfuckers in.

1160
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,195
Dime a dozen, man.
Fuck you.

1161
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:39,733
- Fuck me?
- Yeah.

1162
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:41,268
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1163
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,032
Hey, hold it, hold it!
We gotta cool our shit, here!

1164
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:51,744
Look, you hired the unholy two because
you wanted the best money could buy.

1165
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:54,247
Now, you got nothing
to worry about.

1166
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:56,614
We're gonna
get the job done.

1167
01:20:56,685 --> 01:21:00,416
Might talk a lot of shit,
but we will get the job done.

1168
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:02,319
Here's the deal.

1169
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:05,018
I don't give a good God damn
what condition they're in.

1170
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:08,620
I just want 'em alive so I can piss
in their face before they die.

1171
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:13,300
You are one sick
fucking pirate.

1172
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,928
Hey, Billy Ray,
your mama's on the phone.

1173
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:18,097
She owes me 14 bucks!
Get down here.

1174
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:22,007
- Better keep a rope on that asshole.
- Yeah, I know.

1175
01:21:22,077 --> 01:21:24,568
Now look, G,
let me explain something to you.

1176
01:21:24,646 --> 01:21:28,776
You've been using a bazooka
to exterminate three little roaches.

1177
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:31,785
Now when you hunt roaches,
you don't blow up your house.

1178
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:34,117
You send in an exterminator
so he can--

1179
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:35,952
he crawls like a roach;

1180
01:21:36,024 --> 01:21:38,584
He thinks like a roach;
He has a little roach mind--

1181
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:42,061
Hey... you be careful

1182
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:45,361
or maybe you get
stepped on like a roach.

1183
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:05,644
( grunts )

1184
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,688
I'm gonna tell you
something, brother,

1185
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:09,485
you have got it made.

1186
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:13,755
Please, man, don't be
fooled by the glamour.

1187
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:16,558
I got trouble.
Don't get me started.

1188
01:22:16,631 --> 01:22:18,292
Trouble. What kinda
trouble you got?

1189
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:21,426
Man, you got hot and cold
running pussy on tap!

1190
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:24,666
Man, dealing with these
greedy bitches

1191
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,639
ain't all it's cracked up to be.

1192
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:37,343
Brother, brother...

1193
01:22:37,419 --> 01:22:39,819
( both squawk )

1194
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:43,357
Go ahead.
Pick it up, pick it up.

1195
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:45,723
Take a hit on this.

1196
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:48,422
- ( sniffing )
- Man, I got the best, mmm.

1197
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:50,464
Take one for me too, man.

1198
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:55,559
Hey, listen, you got a nose
like a vacuum cleaner.

1199
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,605
Don't do up all my cocaine.

1200
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:01,301
Brother, would l
do that to you?

1201
01:23:01,376 --> 01:23:03,344
( laughs )
No, you my brother...

1202
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:05,379
- See?
-...and I love you.

1203
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:07,415
- All right.
- All right, baby.

1204
01:23:10,685 --> 01:23:13,586
But I love my cocaine better.
Fuck you.

1205
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:16,453
Oh, man, that's some
cold shit right there.

1206
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:22,089
Well, any port
in a fucking storm.

1207
01:23:24,132 --> 01:23:30,002
* Oh, we are what we are
when in danger *

1208
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:35,867
* And we are as we stand *

1209
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:39,471
* Head in hands *

1210
01:23:39,547 --> 01:23:43,347
* When a friend brings to light *

1211
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:47,013
* On a cold silver night *

1212
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:56,019
* You can stare your fate
right into his hands *

1213
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:02,765
* lnto his hands *

1214
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,970
* Oh, we are what we are *

1215
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,503
* When we're laying too *

1216
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:21,352
* Be the soul alone
in gardens of land *

1217
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:25,325
* And there's always advice *

1218
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:28,658
* On a cold winter's night *

1219
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:36,830
* Like your dreams are
just an island in the sand... *

1220
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:46,339
* Way out in the sand *

1221
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:55,484
* Don't it seem so strange *

1222
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:02,694
* How it just don't change? *

1223
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:05,130
* Yeah *

1224
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:09,193
* Things just stay the same *

1225
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,830
* As they've always been *

1226
01:25:11,906 --> 01:25:15,569
* Some of us are out to win *

1227
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:18,510
* Some of us are... *

1228
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,417
( sighs )

1229
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:31,725
Mmm.

1230
01:25:46,374 --> 01:25:49,537
( laughs )

1231
01:25:49,611 --> 01:25:53,980
Charlie, brother,
my brother--

1232
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:00,477
I've been looking
for you, clown.

1233
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:02,523
Ooh.
( laughs )

1234
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:17,427
You gonna start the killing,

1235
01:26:17,505 --> 01:26:20,406
you best start it right here.

1236
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:22,841
Make sure
I'm all the way dead,

1237
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:26,278
or I will come back
and make you my bitch.

1238
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:30,117
Bitch that, motherfucker.

1239
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:33,552
- ( grunts )
- Billy Ray: Get up, bitch!

1240
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:36,021
( grunting )

1241
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:42,753
Stop it! Stop it, motherfucker!

1242
01:26:42,830 --> 01:26:44,855
( Spaulding screaming )

1243
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,261
- Oh! Fuck! Oh!
- Get these scumbags in that truck.

1244
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:52,568
( groaning )

1245
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,904
It wasn't personal, brother.

1246
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,103
Business is business, baby!

1247
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:00,371
You asshole!

1248
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:03,144
She's right, Charlie.
You are an asshole.

1249
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:06,847
Why don't you get on
your fucking horse and ride?

1250
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:10,322
All right, let's get
this freak show on the road.

1251
01:27:10,391 --> 01:27:13,326
What the fuck are you doing there?
Get the fuck up!

1252
01:27:24,606 --> 01:27:26,574
( silent )

1253
01:28:03,678 --> 01:28:05,771
You know, I got
to thank you all...

1254
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:10,709
for helping me to understand
what my heritage is.

1255
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:14,312
You see, the Wydells,
they've always been vigilante justice.

1256
01:28:14,389 --> 01:28:19,452
Now, my granddaddy,
he rode with the likes of Tom Horn,

1257
01:28:19,527 --> 01:28:21,586
killing scum like
you for a living.

1258
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:24,457
We've always
been devil slayers.

1259
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:26,261
Wake up!

1260
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:30,828
See I tried to walk the line,

1261
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:32,736
but now I realize
there is no line.

1262
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:38,268
We here, we are playing
on a level that most will never see.

1263
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:41,747
I know my brother George,
he didn't see it.

1264
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:43,784
Spaulding:
Maybe he had a divine moment

1265
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:46,081
when his brains
hit the floor.

1266
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:49,146
Yeah, well, maybe you will too.

1267
01:28:51,826 --> 01:28:54,761
I got over here
some photographs

1268
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:58,560
of every missing person
within 100 miles of this shithole.

1269
01:28:58,633 --> 01:29:01,932
Valerie Green.

1270
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,335
Take a look at that.
She was beautiful, huh?

1271
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:06,771
Hell, anybody'd fuck her.

1272
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:11,206
This is what she looked like
when we pulled her out

1273
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:13,110
of your little
fucking torture shack.

1274
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,411
She ain't so fuckable
anymore, huh?

1275
01:29:15,483 --> 01:29:17,110
( laughs )
Oh, yes, she is.

1276
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:20,552
I cut her tongue out
and tied her to my bed for a month.

1277
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:23,351
Busted that bitch wide open.
( laughs )

1278
01:29:23,424 --> 01:29:26,416
Well, then you get
to have this as a souvenir.

1279
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:29,156
- ( staple gun clicking )
- ( screaming )

1280
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:41,105
What about
Mary Knowles, anybody?

1281
01:29:41,175 --> 01:29:43,473
That fucking bitch is mine.

1282
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:47,605
No no, she was mine.
I did her, come on. Bring it onto me.

1283
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:50,048
- Nah, she's all mine.
- Baby, shut the fuck up!

1284
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:53,645
Baby, you want her,
you got her.

1285
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:55,951
( staple gun clicking )

1286
01:29:57,759 --> 01:29:59,852
Fuck, fuck!

1287
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:03,420
Come and get me,
motherfucker!

1288
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:08,964
Spaulding:
Motherfucker!

1289
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:25,316
You see this picture?

1290
01:30:25,386 --> 01:30:27,354
That's my brother George.

1291
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:32,156
Old George,
he was a good man.

1292
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:35,162
Very trusting.

1293
01:30:36,297 --> 01:30:38,265
I'm sure that's
what got him killed.

1294
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,593
Anyway, y'all take
a good look at that.

1295
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:46,264
Because that's the reason
you gonna die tonight.

1296
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:50,037
Yeah, I remember.

1297
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:53,811
Stupid fuck just like you.

1298
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:55,815
Come at me like

1299
01:30:55,883 --> 01:30:59,410
some kinda matinee
fucking cowboy idol.

1300
01:31:02,023 --> 01:31:06,289
All I had to do was point him
in a direction and there he goes,

1301
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,523
Officer Wy-fucking-Dell
to the rescue.

1302
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:13,033
( buzzing )

1303
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,295
( electrical crackling )

1304
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:17,428
Baby: Daddy!

1305
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:21,674
And I hate fucking clowns.

1306
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:28,880
Yeah, you couldn't
do all this by yourself!

1307
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:32,249
( electrical crackling )

1308
01:31:35,923 --> 01:31:38,915
I slayed me a devil
just the other day.

1309
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:41,223
What you think? Huh?

1310
01:31:41,295 --> 01:31:43,422
See any you like?

1311
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:46,058
You liar.
Those photos ain't real.

1312
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:48,533
There's no way
you killed Mama.

1313
01:31:48,603 --> 01:31:50,195
No, Baby, they're real.

1314
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:52,000
Take a look at her right there.

1315
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:55,440
Take a look at her eyes the way
they are like that. She's dead.

1316
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:57,444
You know what I did?

1317
01:31:57,512 --> 01:32:00,743
I took my knife and I stuck
it in there real good.

1318
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:03,611
And I kinda twisted it
a little bit.

1319
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:06,744
kinda like fucked her
with it, you know?

1320
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:08,448
Let me tell you,
that old whore came

1321
01:32:08,523 --> 01:32:10,889
before I fucking took
her miserable life.

1322
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:13,893
You motherfucker.
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1323
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:15,553
You gonna kill me?

1324
01:32:15,630 --> 01:32:17,257
You're gonna
fucking kill me?

1325
01:32:17,331 --> 01:32:20,789
- Get off me, fucker!
- You take a good look at that, bitch.

1326
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:24,395
Take a good, fucking look.
You were her little angel,

1327
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:26,497
her little angel.

1328
01:32:26,574 --> 01:32:30,203
That's why I got something
special in mind for you.

1329
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:32,143
Yeah? Well I can't fucking wait.

1330
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:35,740
If you want it, here it is.
Come and get it. Come on!

1331
01:32:41,055 --> 01:32:43,148
Wydell:
From delusion, lead me to truth.

1332
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,192
From darkness, lead me to light.

1333
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:51,156
From death, lead me to eternal life.

1334
01:32:54,468 --> 01:32:57,335
Hallelujah!

1335
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,339
Are you feeling it, brother?

1336
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:05,473
- ( screaming )
- ( screaming mockingly )

1337
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:16,189
( imitating wind whistling )

1338
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:20,517
It's time to end this little charade.

1339
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:24,395
Look, you're free.

1340
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:27,093
Run.

1341
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:29,068
I said fucking run!

1342
01:33:29,136 --> 01:33:31,036
( whimpers )

1343
01:33:31,105 --> 01:33:33,437
( industrial music playing )

1344
01:33:39,246 --> 01:33:41,339
Burn well, motherfuckers.

1345
01:33:59,433 --> 01:34:01,025
Come and get it!

1346
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:02,797
( moans )

1347
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:05,565
I can hear you, Baby girl!

1348
01:34:10,611 --> 01:34:13,603
I can hear you!

1349
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:15,808
I got something here for ya!

1350
01:34:17,818 --> 01:34:18,944
What's that I smell?

1351
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:22,115
It smells like rabbit!

1352
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:53,417
( howling )

1353
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:06,193
It's me, Charlie, calm down.

1354
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:08,098
How could you do this?
You ruined everything!

1355
01:35:08,169 --> 01:35:11,002
Calm down, Baby!
This is not the time.

1356
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:14,098
- Gotta get you outta here.
- Daddy and Otis are in the house--

1357
01:35:14,175 --> 01:35:17,144
I'll get them, but first we gotta
get you someplace safe.

1358
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,405
Now, come on.

1359
01:35:29,256 --> 01:35:33,454
Cutter! Cutter, wake up!
Cutter, wake up!

1360
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:35,791
Cutter! Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!

1361
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:39,390
( screams )

1362
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:44,693
- Wait in the car and I'll go get them.
- I want to go!

1363
01:35:44,772 --> 01:35:46,706
Oh, just get in! Go on.

1364
01:35:49,477 --> 01:35:51,445
Stay put.

1365
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:55,581
Charlie!

1366
01:36:17,204 --> 01:36:19,900
Run, Baby girl, run.

1367
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:21,839
Run!

1368
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:24,503
Run! Run!
( echoes )

1369
01:36:24,578 --> 01:36:26,341
Run run run!
( echoes )

1370
01:36:31,685 --> 01:36:33,619
Lord, I bet that hurts.

1371
01:36:33,687 --> 01:36:36,315
Man, I could hear
that bone shatter from right here.

1372
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:39,354
What the hell we got here?

1373
01:36:39,426 --> 01:36:42,395
Hey, looky here,
I got something for you.

1374
01:36:42,463 --> 01:36:44,658
Uh-huh.

1375
01:36:44,732 --> 01:36:46,495
Oh, yeah, I got
something for ya.

1376
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:49,035
Hey, get up!

1377
01:36:49,103 --> 01:36:51,697
Come on, I said get up!

1378
01:36:51,772 --> 01:36:53,706
- Fuck you.
- I don't know about you,

1379
01:36:53,774 --> 01:36:56,902
but I sure wish I had
a bullwhip for this occasion,

1380
01:36:56,977 --> 01:36:59,377
but I found this.
I reckon it'll do.

1381
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:04,206
You like that?
You like the feeling of being helpless?

1382
01:37:04,285 --> 01:37:07,982
At the mercy of someone
who's as sadistic and deranged as you?!

1383
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:11,149
Not such a fucking party, is it?
Doesn't make it you feel proud?

1384
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:15,286
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me? Oh, no.

1385
01:37:15,362 --> 01:37:17,660
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

1386
01:37:17,731 --> 01:37:19,699
( silent )

1387
01:38:01,642 --> 01:38:03,610
Tiny.

1388
01:38:07,147 --> 01:38:11,516
Daddy and Otis are
still in the house. Go get 'em.

1389
01:38:11,585 --> 01:38:15,453
( screaming, grunting )

1390
01:38:15,522 --> 01:38:17,888
The nails!
The nails!

1391
01:38:32,539 --> 01:38:35,099
Tiny! Tiny!
Come on, man!

1392
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:54,828
( gasping, coughing )

1393
01:39:00,467 --> 01:39:02,332
Daddy!

1394
01:39:02,403 --> 01:39:04,963
Baby? Baby!

1395
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:07,007
You're okay!

1396
01:39:08,342 --> 01:39:10,276
( coughing, crying )

1397
01:39:10,344 --> 01:39:11,971
Yes.

1398
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:19,116
( ethereal vocalizing )

1399
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:23,819
* Years to come... *

1400
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:30,794
Ow! Oh!

1401
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:42,466
You sure about this?

1402
01:39:45,879 --> 01:39:47,346
We'll come back
for you.

1403
01:39:50,484 --> 01:39:53,920
( ethereal vocalizing continues )

1404
01:39:54,955 --> 01:39:58,118
* Years to come... *

1405
01:40:11,472 --> 01:40:13,770
* Years to come. *

1406
01:40:35,963 --> 01:40:38,932
( rock music playing )

1407
01:41:45,332 --> 01:41:50,895
* If I leave here tomorrow *

1408
01:41:53,407 --> 01:41:58,003
* Would you
still remember me? *

1409
01:42:01,148 --> 01:42:06,950
* Well, I must be
traveling on now *

1410
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:14,484
* There's just too many places
I've got to see *

1411
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:23,368
* And if I stay here
with you, girl *

1412
01:42:26,206 --> 01:42:30,438
* Things just couldn't
be the same *

1413
01:42:34,114 --> 01:42:39,677
* 'Cause I'm as free
as a bird now *

1414
01:42:42,389 --> 01:42:47,417
* And this bird
you cannot change *

1415
01:42:47,494 --> 01:42:50,622
* Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh *

1416
01:42:50,697 --> 01:42:55,464
* And the bird
you cannot change *

1417
01:42:58,272 --> 01:43:05,269
* And this bird
you cannot change *

1418
01:43:05,345 --> 01:43:12,410
* Lord knows
I can't change *

1419
01:43:45,986 --> 01:43:50,753
* Bye-bye, baby,
it's been a sweet love *

1420
01:43:50,824 --> 01:43:53,224
* Yeah, yeah *

1421
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:58,492
* Though this feeling
I can't change *

1422
01:44:02,002 --> 01:44:08,407
* But please don't
take this so badly *

1423
01:44:09,776 --> 01:44:14,008
* 'Cause Lord knows
I'm to blame *

1424
01:44:18,285 --> 01:44:23,814
* But if I stay here
with you, girl *

1425
01:44:25,659 --> 01:44:30,062
* Things just couldn't
be the same *

1426
01:44:33,834 --> 01:44:40,296
* 'Cause I'm as free
as a bird now *

1427
01:44:40,374 --> 01:44:47,007
* And this bird
you cannot change *

1428
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:50,777
* Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh *

1429
01:44:50,851 --> 01:44:55,015
* And this bird
you cannot change *

1430
01:44:57,991 --> 01:45:03,896
* And this bird
you cannot change *

1431
01:45:05,599 --> 01:45:11,936
* Lord knows
I can't change *

1432
01:45:12,005 --> 01:45:15,099
* Lord help me *

1433
01:45:15,175 --> 01:45:19,373
* I can't
cha-ay-ay-ay-ange *

1434
01:45:20,947 --> 01:45:24,849
* Lord, I can't change *

1435
01:45:24,918 --> 01:45:31,983
* Why won't you fly,
free bird? Yeah *

1436
01:45:32,059 --> 01:45:35,222
( guitar solo playing )

1437
01:46:07,961 --> 01:46:10,088
( heartbeat pounding )

1438
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:16,402
( guns firing )

1439
01:46:22,809 --> 01:46:24,777
( acoustic guitar playing )

1440
01:46:53,874 --> 01:46:55,808
* Brave dreams *

1441
01:46:55,876 --> 01:46:59,903
* That are kindled
from ashes *

1442
01:47:01,415 --> 01:47:06,375
* Rise out over
all the battle below *

1443
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:14,486
* Spread wings over
all that he passes *

1444
01:47:14,561 --> 01:47:19,396
* So his life can stay
immortal to his country *

1445
01:47:22,235 --> 01:47:28,663
* All the shades of green
that fall beneath this tree *

1446
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:32,371
* So let the winds
of change *

1447
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:35,108
* That rearrange
the country *

1448
01:47:36,383 --> 01:47:41,844
* Let it also
sow a seed of memory *

1449
01:47:53,567 --> 01:47:59,130
* Marlena in the cool
satin sashes *

1450
01:48:01,041 --> 01:48:06,377
* Spread dreams over
the battle below *

1451
01:48:09,015 --> 01:48:13,952
* Bring love with
a song as she passes *

1452
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:19,151
* So his life can stay
immortal to the country *

1453
01:48:21,695 --> 01:48:24,459
* And let every man *

1454
01:48:24,531 --> 01:48:28,262
* Aware of being free *

1455
01:48:28,335 --> 01:48:35,298
* Mmm, when she talks of times
when wine is handed to me *

1456
01:48:35,375 --> 01:48:42,110
* From a face that
walked out of a memory *

1457
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:50,520
* And now that
the battle is done *

1458
01:48:50,590 --> 01:48:54,117
* And you wake up
in the morning *

1459
01:48:54,194 --> 01:48:57,789
* With the sun
up in the sky *

1460
01:49:00,634 --> 01:49:06,664
* Summer never gives you
no warning then *

1461
01:49:06,740 --> 01:49:12,838
* Flowers are getting thrown up
to cover the mud up on the line *

1462
01:49:12,913 --> 01:49:17,009
* Valleys getting greener
and there's *

1463
01:49:17,083 --> 01:49:23,545
* Nothing but love
on your mind... *

1464
01:49:43,777 --> 01:49:49,374
* Brave dreams that are
kindled from ashes *

1465
01:49:50,684 --> 01:49:55,917
* Rise out over
the battle below *

1466
01:49:57,958 --> 01:50:03,487
* Spread wings over
all that he passes *

1467
01:50:03,563 --> 01:50:08,557
* So his life can stay
immortal to the country *

1468
01:50:11,204 --> 01:50:16,767
* Other shades of the green
that bought for me a victory *

1469
01:50:18,211 --> 01:50:20,873
* But the winds
of change *

1470
01:50:20,947 --> 01:50:24,883
* Have rearranged
this country *

1471
01:50:24,951 --> 01:50:30,685
* Let it also sow the seed
of memory, yeah *

1472
01:50:32,225 --> 01:50:38,357
* Let it always sow
the seed of memory, yeah *

1473
01:50:39,566 --> 01:50:41,761
* Let it always sow *

1474
01:50:41,835 --> 01:50:46,704
* Whoa-oh,
the seed of memory. *
