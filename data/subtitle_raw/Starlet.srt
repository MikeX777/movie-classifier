00:15:46,158 --> 00:15:47,921
<i>Pussy so good</i>
<i>and it taste like a honey bun</i>

175
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:51,395
- <i>I'm tasty</i>
- <i>Pink Dollaz</i>

176
00:15:56,369 --> 00:15:59,304
- <i>And we run that shit</i>
- <i>I'm tasty</i>

177
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:06,578
Starlet, where's she going?

178
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:08,580
<i>Hip-hop ]</i>

179
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,840
Stay.

180
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:22,256
Hey. Um, you just dropped my friend off,
but I can take her home.

181
00:16:22,328 --> 00:16:24,626
- You mean the old lady?
- Yeah.

182
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:26,722
- Okay. Well-
- How much is it?

183
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,133
- Well, I have, uh, 1 3.25.
- That's fine.

184
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:33,194
- This is-This should cover it.
- That's- Oh, that's plenty.

185
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:35,035
- Are you kidding? Thanks.
- No, that's fine.

186
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,982
Oh, my God. Hi!

187
00:16:53,392 --> 00:16:57,351
Do you remember me? I was the one
who bought the thermos from you.

188
00:17:02,968 --> 00:17:06,267
- Hey, what's wrong?
- My cab's gone.

189
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,085
- Well, I can give you a ride.
No problem.

190
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:09,831
- No. I'll call another.

191
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:12,469
No, no, no. Totally fine. I got it.

192
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:14,672
Here. I'll grab those.

193
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:18,583
- No, no, no.
- Don't worry. Honestly. Hop in the car.

194
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:20,175
There. Right there.

195
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:24,647
Get in!
I won't take no for an answer. Come on.

196
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,528
It's so weird running into you.

197
00:17:33,466 --> 00:17:36,333
I like that grocery store.
It's really good.

198
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:38,870
They have a good variety of cereal.

199
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:42,270
And they're always in stock
with Rice Krispie Treats.

200
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:44,568
It thrills me on all levels.

201
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:50,876
You can just leave 'em right there.

202
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,145
No, it's fine.
I'll take them into the kitchen.

203
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,187
Is it that way?

204
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:57,051
Starlet. Off. Get off.

205
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:59,523
Starlet. Starlet. Get off.

206
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:02,390
- Starlet.
- Okay. I'll show you.

207
00:18:30,623 --> 00:18:32,557
Oh, I see. You want money.

208
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,059
No. No. No, no, no.

209
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:37,527
Totally fine.

210
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:42,030
Okay. Thank you then.

211
00:18:42,935 --> 00:18:45,699
I'm a little... parched.

212
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:47,068
What?

213
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:48,936
I'm kind of thirsty.

214
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:51,272
Oh, God.

215
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:58,239
Here.

216
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:01,843
Thank you.

217
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:06,290
- Oh. Do you have any ice?
- No.

218
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:13,895
- Are you thirsty?
- What are you doing?

219
00:19:13,966 --> 00:19:16,332
- Starlet.
- What are you doing?

220
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,370
That dog's drinking out of that-
my, my glass.

221
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:20,564
He's completely clean. It's fine.

222
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:22,607
- I'll have to throw my glass away.
- No-

223
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:24,905
Do you realize an animal's
drinking out of my glass?

224
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:26,342
Sorry.

225
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:29,711
That's sickening.
And you're drinking out of it?

226
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:34,282
That's sick. Disgusting.

227
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,554
It's really nice here.

228
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:57,232
It's good water.

229
00:19:57,776 --> 00:19:59,334
It's water.

230
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:23,596
Where you goin'?

231
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:25,561
Wow.

232
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:27,833
Why do you have so many Eiffel Towers?

233
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:30,942
I love Paris.

234
00:20:32,244 --> 00:20:34,439
What do you like about Paris?

235
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,882
The Arc de Triomphe.

236
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,179
Champs-Elysees.

237
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:44,882
Petit Palais.

238
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:46,652
I love it all.

239
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:49,250
Don't touch anything!
Put it down.

240
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:51,552
Sorry.

241
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,930
The Eiffel Tower in
Vegas is pretty cool.

242
00:21:10,716 --> 00:21:12,707
So what do you do?

243
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:15,586
What do you mean what do I do?

244
00:21:15,654 --> 00:21:17,952
Like during the day. Like-

245
00:21:19,024 --> 00:21:22,323
Like I-I don't know.
I go out with my friends...

246
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:26,387
and we go clubbing,
and sometimes I'll lie out...

247
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:29,696
and sometimes I'll take
Starlet for a walk.

248
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:32,327
And-

249
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:34,999
I don't know. For, like, fun.

250
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:37,065
You know, like, whoo!

251
00:21:38,377 --> 00:21:40,106
I don't know. For fun.

252
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,347
I play bingo every Saturday at St.
Anne's.

253
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,014
Is that your idea of fun?

254
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:55,624
Yeah.

255
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:58,322
That's what I do.

256
00:22:05,404 --> 00:22:06,632
Okay.

257
00:22:06,705 --> 00:22:09,230
Well, I'm gonna go...

258
00:22:09,308 --> 00:22:11,401
and I'm gonna give you my number.

259
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:14,873
And if you ever need a ride
to the grocery store...

260
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:17,541
or, like, any little errand or whatever-

261
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:21,780
I can get a cab. I don't need you.
It's-That's stupid.

262
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:24,021
Yeah, but it's so silly.

263
00:22:24,022 --> 00:22:26,188
I mean, I'm not gonna
charge you anything, and I-

264
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:28,852
It's easier. You just call me.

265
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:31,691
- Okay.
- Yeah.

266
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:34,665
And I'll bring my trusty sidekick.

267
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:36,325
Thank you for the water.

268
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:38,870
- Yeah.
- Okay. But really, call me.

269
00:22:38,937 --> 00:22:39,995
Bye!

270
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:41,665
Bye.

271
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:03,421
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Is Mikey home?

272
00:23:03,495 --> 00:23:05,258
Uh, I don't know. I'll check.

273
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,427
- Mikey.
- Huh?

274
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,696
There are a couple kids outside for you.

275
00:23:12,504 --> 00:23:14,995
Oh. Fuck.

276
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,065
You gotta take this fucking game for me.
You gotta take this game.

277
00:23:17,142 --> 00:23:18,871
It's a fucking live game.
It's a live game.

278
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:22,510
Do not get me killed.

279
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:25,176
<i>Machine Gun Fire]</i>

280
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:28,185
Okay, look. I need a little favor.
Mikey's being cheap as fucking usual...

281
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:32,019
and I need to borrow $250, otherwise
they're gonna take away Big Red.

282
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,288
They can't take away Big Red.

283
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,493
Sorry, it's none of
my business, but why

284
00:23:37,494 --> 00:23:39,626
the fuck do you let him
handle your money?

285
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:43,657
'Cause he's saving up
for some big extravaganza.

286
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:46,637
I don't know,
some big thing he's been plotting.

287
00:23:46,705 --> 00:23:48,935
Did you get me fucking smoked?

288
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:51,498
You didn't get me smoked, did you? Here.
Thank you.

289
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:54,242
You rock, Janie-Poo.

290
00:23:54,313 --> 00:23:56,247
Janie-Poo.

291
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:59,083
What? I come up with cute nicknames...

292
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:01,949
unlike some people,
who just call me ''Babe.''

293
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,688
300.

294
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:10,525
Thanks. Arash owes me a
check anyway, so I'll

295
00:24:10,526 --> 00:24:12,288
just pay you back when
he gets it to me.

296
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:13,353
Whatever.

297
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:21,272
Find it yet?

298
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:30,639
Here's a diagonal,
the last number called.

299
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:34,413
And there's a second diagonal
with the last number called.

300
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:37,217
Are there any others?

301
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:38,984
Are there any others?

302
00:24:39,057 --> 00:24:40,922
Game closed, with one winner.

303
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:44,792
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

304
00:24:44,863 --> 00:24:47,331
- Hi.
- Hi, can I help you?

305
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,960
Um, yeah. What do I need?

306
00:24:51,036 --> 00:24:53,004
- For what?
- For the game.

307
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:54,595
- To play bingo?
- Yeah.

308
00:24:54,673 --> 00:24:56,664
You would need one of these packs.

309
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:59,609
- Okay, and how much is it?
- It's $25.

310
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:02,506
Out of a hundred.

311
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:05,273
There you go, and good luck.

312
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:07,545
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

313
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:09,418
Thanks.

314
00:25:26,138 --> 00:25:28,106
B-4.

315
00:25:30,008 --> 00:25:31,566
B-4.

316
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:33,834
Hi.

317
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:38,841
What are you doing here?

318
00:25:42,187 --> 00:25:43,586
Bingo.

319
00:25:45,891 --> 00:25:48,189
I've never seen you here before.

320
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:52,158
Well, it's a new interest.

321
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:02,263
O-7 1.

322
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:07,935
O... 7 1.

323
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:10,197
- Phew.

324
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:11,880
- Can I borrow one of your markers?
I forgot mine.

325
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,579
Oh, go ahead. Take one.

326
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:18,180
Thank you.

327
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:24,352
B-3.

328
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,329
Look. It matches my sweater.

329
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:28,764
B-3.

330
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:31,766
I'm playing bingo. Leave me alone.

331
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:36,074
I love this game.

332
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,303
O-7 0.

333
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:39,605
Bingo!

334
00:26:39,678 --> 00:26:43,239
There is a bingo.
B-7. Hold your cards.

335
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:45,108
Oh-

336
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:49,882
Game closed with one winner.
Give the lucky player $1 50.

337
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:52,253
There's a five minute break here.

338
00:26:52,324 --> 00:26:55,521
Plenty of room down there.
You don't have to sit here.

339
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:57,027
One and 30.

340
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:59,495
But I don't know anybody else here.

341
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,561
N-38.

342
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:10,005
B-1 1.

343
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:14,174
N-3 5.

344
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:17,671
B-1 0.

345
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:25,516
O-69.

346
00:27:28,126 --> 00:27:30,151
O-69.

347
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:33,896
Oh, my cab. My cab's not here.

348
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:37,732
- What happened?
- My cab. My cab's not here.

349
00:27:37,803 --> 00:27:39,327
Again?

350
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:41,872
- That's just weird.
- Oh.

351
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,430
Weird.

352
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,844
I guess I can give you a ride.

353
00:27:50,716 --> 00:27:55,176
I'm a Sagittarius, which means I'm
really- I'm really good with people...

354
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:57,346
according to my chart.

355
00:27:57,422 --> 00:27:59,356
I bet you're like...

356
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:01,850
a Pisces.

357
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:03,986
You seem very sensitive.

358
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:06,961
And quiet.

359
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,508
So...

360
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:22,470
do you ever win at bingo?

361
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:28,344
- Oh, my God! Fu-
- Help!

362
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,684
Get it off! Oh, my God!

363
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:33,816
- Fucking crazy old bitch!
- You think I was born yesterday?

364
00:28:33,892 --> 00:28:36,383
I know a scammer when I see one. Help!

365
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:38,122
- Bingo?
- Yes!

366
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:42,758
You said something about a bingo game,
and she maced you as a result of that?

367
00:28:42,834 --> 00:28:44,501
- She's fucking insane!

368
00:28:44,502 --> 00:28:46,167
- Hey, hey, hey!
Again with the language.

369
00:28:46,238 --> 00:28:48,536
The cab was gone, and
she was there, and she

370
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:50,834
said, ''Oh, well,
I'll take you home.''

371
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:52,433
- As a favor?
- As a favor.

372
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:54,138
Fine. Done. We're done.

373
00:28:54,212 --> 00:28:56,840
I suggest you take her
to a fucking crazy person's home.

374
00:28:56,915 --> 00:29:00,043
I felt that there's
something funny here.

375
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:02,313
- Please get in your vehicle and-
- I'm getting in my vehicle.

376
00:29:02,387 --> 00:29:03,376
and drive away.

377
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:06,015
So you see this lady weekly?
You see her all the time?

378
00:29:06,091 --> 00:29:09,117
You know, it's like every time
I turned around she was there.

379
00:29:09,194 --> 00:29:11,287
So it's like I'm being haunted by this-

380
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:14,394
What is-

381
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,595
Starlet.

382
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:18,158
Jesus.

383
00:29:19,037 --> 00:29:21,028
Yeah. Look at that. No.

384
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:24,538
No.

385
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:27,669
So what kind of cars do you have?

386
00:29:27,746 --> 00:29:30,977
I got some trucks. I got S.U.V.s.
I got some sports cars.

387
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:32,914
How much down payment
are you working with?

388
00:29:32,984 --> 00:29:35,009
With like-

389
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:38,215
I don't know.
I've got some cash.

390
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,258
Oh, it's so pretty.

391
00:29:40,325 --> 00:29:42,156
Told you.

392
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:46,692
Okay, so how much monthly then
are we talking?

393
00:29:46,765 --> 00:29:49,529
We gotta put it in the computer system.
That way I can figure out...

394
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:51,592
how many months you wanna go,
stuff like that.

395
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,797
Wait. Hold on. Sorry. Hello?

396
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:56,705
I was just calling to say that...

397
00:29:56,775 --> 00:29:59,869
the officers told me that
you weren't up to shenanigans...

398
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:01,776
that you were trying-
you were just-

399
00:30:01,847 --> 00:30:03,815
you were trying to be a Good Samaritan.

400
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,548
Okay. Apology accepted, I guess.

401
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,644
Bye.

402
00:30:10,388 --> 00:30:14,017
I appreciate Good Samaritans.

403
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:16,322
Okay, great. Bye.

404
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:19,955
Uh, oh, oh, and if you're
still interested...

405
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:23,660
in driving me to the supermarket,
that would be fine.

406
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:25,828
Oh, that'd be fine, would it?

407
00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:28,263
Bye.

408
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,898
Bye.

409
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:32,567
Fucking unbelievable.

410
00:30:33,145 --> 00:30:34,612
Sorry.

411
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:23,250
Why'd you name him Starlet?
He's a boy.

412
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:27,455
I don't know. I had the name
Starlet first, and then...

413
00:31:27,532 --> 00:31:30,000
found him at a rescue shelter.

414
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:32,002
Just kinda stuck with it.

415
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,766
You like it, don't you? Don't you?

416
00:31:36,841 --> 00:31:38,570
Don't you?

417
00:31:45,483 --> 00:31:47,280
I like your garden.

418
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,644
Well, I've had it a long time, 40 years.

419
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,588
What's your favorite flower?

420
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:57,389
Mmm, I like the morning glory.

421
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:00,790
I really like those ones.

422
00:32:03,368 --> 00:32:08,237
They remind me of my neighbor
back in Florida.

423
00:32:09,274 --> 00:32:11,868
She had them covering her front yard.

424
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:16,271
Can't remember what
they're called though, like-

425
00:32:16,348 --> 00:32:18,009
Black-eyed Susan.

426
00:32:18,516 --> 00:32:19,642
Yeah.

427
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:39,162
- So were you ever married?
- Yep.

428
00:32:43,775 --> 00:32:45,800
A long time ago.

429
00:32:47,245 --> 00:32:48,473
Yeah.

430
00:32:48,546 --> 00:32:51,709
Frank died. He had a heart attack.

431
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,273
I'm sorry.

432
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:56,818
- What'd he do?
- He was a gambler.

433
00:32:58,657 --> 00:33:00,887
Wait. That's what he did?

434
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,324
For a living?

435
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:03,622
Yeah.

436
00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:08,858
- Wow.
- Just a gambler.

437
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:14,967
So what are you doing
before bingo tomorrow?

438
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,270
Why? What are you asking for?

439
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:20,110
- I don't know.
Do you wanna have brunch?

440
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:21,776
- I don't do brunch.

441
00:33:22,714 --> 00:33:24,204
Lunch?

442
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:26,307
Don't do lunch either.

443
00:33:27,786 --> 00:33:29,811
Um, late breakfast?

444
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:31,321
Okay.

445
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:32,879
7:30.

446
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,450
No, no, no. I said a late breakfast.

447
00:33:35,527 --> 00:33:38,052
That's two and a half hours
past the time I would eat.

448
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:43,066
Fine. 7:30 it is.

449
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:03,543
Dude.

450
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:07,351

- What are you doing? No.

451
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:09,359
What the fuck?

452
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,095
Melissa!

453
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:23,163
Melissa, somebody just stole your car!

454
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:24,367
What?

455
00:34:24,442 --> 00:34:27,172
- Somebody just stole your fucking car!
- What the fuck? What?

456
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:29,213
- Yeah, somebody just stole your car!
- Oh, my fuck.

457
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,111
Mikey, somebody fucking took the car.

458
00:34:31,182 --> 00:34:32,979
- Should I call the cops?
- No!

459
00:34:33,051 --> 00:34:36,214
Tell her not to fucking call the cops.
It just got repoed.

460
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:38,482
Don't call the cops.

461
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:41,218
- What? Why?
- Fucking repo.

462
00:34:42,293 --> 00:34:43,960
Why you getting mad at me?

463
00:34:43,961 --> 00:34:45,626
I told you not to fucking
park it there. Ow!

464
00:34:45,697 --> 00:34:48,723
You guys are fucking insane.

466
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:09,410
Jesus, you're hungry.

467
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:15,149
Well, the secret to living to be my age
is a big breakfast like this.

468
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:16,386
No lunch...

469
00:35:17,595 --> 00:35:20,996
and a salad for dinner,
and you have the perfect bowel movement.

470
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:23,723
Jesus.

471
00:35:28,072 --> 00:35:30,063
So, um...

472
00:35:31,276 --> 00:35:32,766
yard sales often?

473
00:35:32,844 --> 00:35:35,870
- What?
- Do you have yard sales often?

474
00:35:37,148 --> 00:35:38,615
Um-

475
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:41,379
Insurance company made me do it.

476
00:35:41,986 --> 00:35:43,476
Why?

477
00:35:46,224 --> 00:35:48,419
The mailman, clumsy idiot.

478
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:53,157
There was a little crack in the steps,
and he fell and broke his leg.

479
00:35:53,231 --> 00:35:55,722
And there was weeds and clutter...

480
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,793
and they said it was a risk
and a safety hazard...

481
00:35:59,871 --> 00:36:03,534
and so they-
they're forcing me to clean it up.

482
00:36:04,709 --> 00:36:06,734
I didn't know they could do that.

483
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,715
So...

484
00:36:14,285 --> 00:36:17,083
the thermos I bought from you-

485
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:19,283
Is it-

486
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:21,948
Is it-

487
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:25,325
What's with you and this thermos?

488
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:27,023
Is it broken?

489
00:36:27,098 --> 00:36:29,293
No, no, no. I was just- I mean-

490
00:36:33,037 --> 00:36:34,527
Is it yours, or-

491
00:36:34,606 --> 00:36:36,574
Of course it's mine.

492
00:36:36,641 --> 00:36:39,508
- I wouldn't have put it-
- I was just asking. I just-

493
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:41,875
Is something wrong with it?

494
00:36:41,946 --> 00:36:45,040
- You can get your money back.
- No, it works great. Thank you.

495
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,515
So...

496
00:36:48,753 --> 00:36:51,085
after your husband died...

497
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:55,016
did you ever think of getting remarried?

498
00:36:55,093 --> 00:36:56,321
No.

499
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:03,423
You have children?

500
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:08,763
No.

501
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,432
Thank you.

502
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,004
- I insist.
- Stop. It's not even that much.

503
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:16,177
- No, it's mine.

504
00:37:16,178 --> 00:37:17,274
- I didn't even eat that much.
It's fine.

505
00:37:17,348 --> 00:37:21,478
It's mine. Listen. I have more money
than I can ever spend in my lifetime.

506
00:37:21,553 --> 00:37:23,111
- You do?
- Yes.

507
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:26,382
Remember I told you
Franky was a gambler?

508
00:37:26,457 --> 00:37:27,651
Yeah.

509
00:37:28,526 --> 00:37:30,323
He was a good one.

510

G-49.

Why don't you have any of those good
luck charms that everybody else has?

515
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,171
They don't-
They don't work. I don't use that stuff.

516
00:37:51,249 --> 00:37:52,238
- Really?
- No.

517
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:55,218
- G-5 5.
- It's not my thing.

518
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,515
- Because-
- I don't like that stuff.

- Bingo!
- I'm done.

522

You win some, you lose some.

523
00:38:10,234 --> 00:38:12,259
No, you lose them all.

524
00:38:12,337 --> 00:38:17,639
I'll have you know,
last year I won a game.

525
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,107
- A game?
- Yes.

526
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:21,645
- Really?
- Yes.

527
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:24,648
- What did you win?
- $1 25.

528
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:27,168
Jesus, you'd think your
husband's gambling

529
00:38:27,169 --> 00:38:29,619
luck would have rubbed
off on you a bit more.

530
00:38:30,388 --> 00:38:32,083
Hmm.

531
00:38:36,694 --> 00:38:37,820
What?

532
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:41,989
I haven't-

533
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,334
I haven't seen Frank in three months.

534
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:50,732
What do you mean you haven't seen Frank
in three months? I thought he was dead.

535
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:53,106
He <i>is</i> dead.

536
00:38:53,177 --> 00:38:57,773
I- I mean, I haven't been to the
cemetery since I stopped driving.

537
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,284
Did you lose your license?

538
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,445
No. I gave it up.

539
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:06,513
On my birthday last year.

540
00:39:06,591 --> 00:39:09,151
I went to the D.M.V. and turned it in.

541
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:12,758
Jesus. Why the fuck
would you turn in your license?

542
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,457
That's retarded.

543
00:39:14,532 --> 00:39:16,899
Because when old people
are old, they're old,

544
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,265
and they don't need to
be driving anymore.

545
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:20,964
You see that lady over there?

546
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,030
- That's Dorothy.
- Yeah.

547
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:28,439
She was driving on the sidewalk...

548
00:39:28,513 --> 00:39:31,607
for three blocks and
didn't even realize it...

549
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,050
and then hit two pedestrians.

550
00:39:34,118 --> 00:39:36,177
56.

551
00:39:36,254 --> 00:39:38,313
They have no business driving...

552
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:40,357
'cause they're old.

553
00:39:42,727 --> 00:39:45,753
So basically you're
trying to ask for a ride?

554
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,161
Hmm.

555
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:52,700
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

556
00:39:55,206 --> 00:39:57,674
Do you want me to give you a ride?

557
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,937
- 61.
- Ah-

558
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,037
Ah-

559
00:40:02,914 --> 00:40:06,315
Oh, you know you want a ride,
and I'm gonna give you a ride.

560
00:40:06,384 --> 00:40:09,683
Stop. Get off my thing!
Just stop playing with my board!

561
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:12,347
Hi, Goobers! Kisses!

562
00:40:13,624 --> 00:40:15,216
What are you doing?

563
00:40:15,293 --> 00:40:17,227
- Dyeing my hair.
- No.

564
00:40:17,295 --> 00:40:19,286
No. Stop. You're gonna mess up. Sit.

565
00:40:19,363 --> 00:40:21,558
I got ''Loo-shis'' Raspberry.

566
00:40:21,632 --> 00:40:24,294
- Luscious.
- Luscious. Luscious Raspberry.

567
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:26,836
I know- 'Cause I know, like, on the-

568
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:29,873
You know like on the color wheel
what things go together.

569
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:32,171
I would've been good at that.

570
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:35,940
Like, you know, and, like...

571
00:40:36,013 --> 00:40:38,709
you know, work at one
of those salons and-

572
00:40:38,783 --> 00:40:41,047
I thought about, like, Hot Pink too...

573
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,488
but that's kind of like too, you know,
whorey, like wanting attention.

574
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:47,421
Red's more subtle.

575
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:10,473
Stop. That's it.
Stop, stop, stop, stop. That's it.

576
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:12,243
- Where?
- Okay. Right here. Right here.

577
00:41:12,316 --> 00:41:14,307
Could you back up a little tiny bit?

578
00:41:16,821 --> 00:41:18,550
That's too much.

579
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:21,387
- That's too much.
- Well, I don't-You said back up.

580
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:23,450
- I assumed that you wanted to go back.
- I just-

581
00:41:23,528 --> 00:41:26,395
Yeah, but I don't want that much.
Just- Now that's it.

582
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:28,193
- Is this okay?
- Stop right here. That's it.

583
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:29,756
- You sure?
- That's it. Good.

584
00:41:29,834 --> 00:41:32,530
- Maybe we can make it better and-
- I want you to-

585
00:41:32,603 --> 00:41:34,571
- Stop. You're making me nuts!
- This is nice.

586
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:37,073
Will you stop? This is it.

587
00:41:37,141 --> 00:41:39,473
You got the car crooked.

588
00:41:40,778 --> 00:41:42,769
Are those from your garden?

589
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:46,544
Yes, I try to bring a different bunch
every time I come.

590
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:49,709
I'll be back.

591
00:42:30,394 --> 00:42:33,022
I really prefer my own brand.

592
00:42:34,532 --> 00:42:37,194
That dry shit
that you shove into hot water?

593
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:19,804
- Hello?
- Janey, it's me.

594
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:23,211
My cell phone got shut off.
Can you give me a ride to Renegade?

595
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:26,497
- I'll do it when I get home.

596
00:43:26,498 --> 00:43:28,579
- No, no, no. I need a ride now.
It's an emergency.

597
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:30,587
All the other girls got
their checks but me.

598
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:32,452
Where are you?

599
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:34,388
Um-

600
00:43:34,458 --> 00:43:37,450
I'm on the corner
of Winnetka and Vanowen.

601
00:43:40,097 --> 00:43:41,724
What's up?

602
00:43:42,566 --> 00:43:44,591
We have to take a slight detour.

603
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:56,672
I'm really sorry about this, by the way.

604
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,848
In back.

605
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:08,450
Hey! Watch Starlet!
Jesus, Melissa! Come on.

606
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:11,188
Arash is totally fucking me.

607
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:13,593
Why isn't Mikey handling this?

608
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:15,859
Because he said
he doesn't want to rock the boat.

609
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,967
- <i>Renegade</i>
- It's Zana.

610
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,175
Zana. Zana!

611
00:44:31,248 --> 00:44:33,773
She's quite the stable one.

612
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:35,512
Hmm. Yeah.

613
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:43,822
Walking!

614
00:44:44,595 --> 00:44:46,688
You wanna tell me why
you haven't fucking paid me?

615
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:49,499
- Huh?
- Let me call you back.

616
00:44:50,368 --> 00:44:52,632
Where's my fucking money?

617
00:44:52,703 --> 00:44:54,568
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

618
00:44:54,638 --> 00:44:56,765
- You didn't even work.
- What are you talking about?

619
00:44:56,841 --> 00:44:58,809
You don't even remember
what happened, do you?

620
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:02,869
You couldn't perform, I called a
cab for you, and I sent you home.

621
00:45:02,947 --> 00:45:04,881
Do you remember that?

622
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:07,042
So pay me my fucking kill fee then.

623
00:45:07,118 --> 00:45:09,183
What kill fee?
You know very well kill fee

624
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:11,248
is paid when I'm the
one who cancels.

625
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:12,949
- Then-
- What are you talking about?

626
00:45:13,024 --> 00:45:14,855
Then help me find a new job like you-

627
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:17,485
Then fucking help me like you said
you were gonna fucking help me!

628
00:45:17,561 --> 00:45:18,943
- I have been trying to
help you for months.

629
00:45:18,944 --> 00:45:20,325
- You'd pay me if you
wanted to help me!

630
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:21,945
- Pay you for what?

631
00:45:21,946 --> 00:45:23,492
- Pay me for my work!
Or for my not work!

632
00:45:23,567 --> 00:45:25,399
If you don't wanna
hire me, then fucking

633
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,230
help me, like you say
you're gonna help me.

634
00:45:27,304 --> 00:45:29,795
You know what? I had enough of this. Go.

635
00:45:29,874 --> 00:45:32,104
''I had enough of this.
Go. Oh, get out.''

636
00:45:32,176 --> 00:45:33,939
- Be nice.
- ''Be nice.''

637
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:37,071
- Fucking sand nigger.
- Get the fuck out of here! Janice!

638
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:40,573
What kind of business is this?

639
00:45:42,053 --> 00:45:45,784
Um, it's like a temp agency.

640
00:45:46,824 --> 00:45:48,121
Hmm.

641
00:45:49,193 --> 00:45:51,684
- Get the fuck off me, bitch.
- Bitch?

642
00:45:51,762 --> 00:45:54,629
- You're outta here! Outta here!
- I'm not fucking going anywhere!

643
00:45:54,698 --> 00:45:55,830
- Out!

644
00:45:55,831 --> 00:45:56,962
- Oh, I wanna punch you
in your brown face!

645
00:45:57,034 --> 00:45:59,002
- Why don't you do it then?
- Stop it. You stop too!

646
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,265
- You fucking touch us all!
- Get her out of here!

647
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:02,669
- You fucking love
molesting all of us, huh?

648
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:04,000
- When did that happen? When?

649
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:06,703
I bet you fucking touch Janice,
and she fucking likes it!

650
00:46:06,777 --> 00:46:10,144
- You're out!
- I'm going. I'll take my sweet time.

651
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:13,047
Get that fucking thing out of my face.

652
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:16,243
Wow. I'm really gonna miss it here.

653
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,309
Come on.

654
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,345
Stop.

655
00:46:19,423 --> 00:46:21,204
I'm trying to make this a
little better for you.

656
00:46:21,205 --> 00:46:22,984
You could at least just
walk out with some class.

657
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,324
- Oh!
- What is that?

658
00:46:25,396 --> 00:46:27,364
What are you doing? Zana, come on.

659
00:46:27,431 --> 00:46:30,525
How's that for B.T.S.?
Fucking pathetic losers.

660
00:46:30,601 --> 00:46:32,432
You are so paying for that.

661
00:46:32,503 --> 00:46:36,064
Oh, I'll fucking pay for it
when Arash pays me, bitches!

662
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,734
Suck it!

663
00:46:39,944 --> 00:46:41,809
Thanks, Zana.
You're gonna get me fired.

664
00:46:41,879 --> 00:46:43,813
Suck my dick.

665
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:52,648
Jane, please, you have to go
get me my money. Please?

666
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:00,820
It's Tess.

667
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,167
Hey, Amy.

668
00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:06,533
- Wait, Tess-
- No, I have to deal with this.

669
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:07,628
Really?

670
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:18,281
You all right?

671
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:23,987
Who are you?

672
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:26,415
- I mean-
- That's not-not my problem.

673
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,890
Can somebody just talk to her?
Janice, you're good with her. Come on.

674
00:47:28,959 --> 00:47:31,178
I was good with her,
until she came flying in

675
00:47:31,179 --> 00:47:33,396
here like some cracked-out
little spider monkey.

676
00:47:33,464 --> 00:47:34,477
- She called me a bitch.
She's shoving people.

677
00:47:34,478 --> 00:47:35,489
- Fuck.

678
00:47:35,566 --> 00:47:36,914
- We're done.

679
00:47:36,915 --> 00:47:38,262
- I don't know what to say to her.
She's in my car.

680
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:39,331
- I just-

681
00:47:39,332 --> 00:47:40,326
- Let's go downstairs.
I'll walk you down.

682
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:42,304
Come. I gotta talk to you.

683
00:47:43,207 --> 00:47:45,539
By the way,
we are number one in preorders.

684
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,410
That means you are getting the cover.

685
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:51,004
- Really?
- Yeah. How cool is that?

686
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:54,874
Oh, it's a pleasure
to meetJane's grandmother.

687
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:58,285
- I'm not her grandmother.
- Arash, she's not my grandmother.

688
00:47:58,355 --> 00:47:59,720
Oh, I'm sorry.

689
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:03,317
And you-
I'm gonna be very nice to you.

690
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:05,692
- I'm gonna freeze you for one month.
- What?

691
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:09,130
And ask your boyfriend
what a noncompete clause means...

692
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,033
'cause if I hear you're taking other
work, you're through for life.

693
00:48:12,102 --> 00:48:14,536
- Hey, we should go.
- It was a pleasure meeting you, ma'am.

694
00:48:14,605 --> 00:48:16,436
- Bye.
- Wait. What about the expo, Arash?

695
00:48:16,507 --> 00:48:18,441
- You're not coming to the show.
- What?

696
00:48:30,554 --> 00:48:32,044
- Thanks.
- Bye.

697
00:48:38,662 --> 00:48:42,189
- So what's up with the old lady?
- Just somebody I'm helping out.

698
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:44,701
Helping with what?

699
00:48:48,606 --> 00:48:50,096
It's nothing.

700
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:05,211
Hello?

701
00:49:05,823 --> 00:49:07,154
Hey, Janice.

702
00:49:08,058 --> 00:49:09,958
Cool. Yeah, I'll be there at 1 0:00.

703
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:12,355
Okay.

704
00:49:13,731 --> 00:49:16,291
Wait. Who am I working with tomorrow?

705
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:19,159
Ooh.

706
00:49:20,404 --> 00:49:22,372
You think you could
talk to him for me and

707
00:49:22,373 --> 00:49:24,340
just kind of, like,
smooth things over?

708
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:31,414
Can't you just let things
blow over for a couple weeks?

709
00:49:32,449 --> 00:49:34,644
I mean, it'll be fine.

710
00:49:38,155 --> 00:49:39,622
Yeah.

711
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,686
Okay.

712
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,661
- Walk him. Make sure he pees.
- Yeah, yeah.

713
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:49,426
- Hey, have fun today.
- Thank you. Bye.

714
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,524
Bye.

<i>Hip-hop ]</i>

716
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:03,279
So full of people-

717
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:06,674
Do it, girl. They keep telling
me I should have one...

718
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,548
'cause every time one of them
mentions me, my followers go up.

719
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,644
I'm like, really?

720
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:14,588
- Okay, mush.
- You can cover my third eye.

721
00:50:17,961 --> 00:50:18,985
One more.

722
00:50:20,331 --> 00:50:22,196
There you go.

723
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:26,327
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hi.

724
00:50:26,403 --> 00:50:28,166
- Cammie, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

725
00:50:28,238 --> 00:50:30,900
Good. Make sure she looks like
million bucks today.

726
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:32,908
Oh. Done!

727
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:34,534
Chin up.

728
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:39,039
- Cool.
- Thank you.

729
00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:47,757
- Pull that light down a little bit.
- You got it.

730
00:50:47,825 --> 00:50:50,658
And, uh, remove those stingers
over there, and we'll go ahead-

731
00:50:50,728 --> 00:50:52,355
- Tess, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

732
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:54,021
- Good. This is Manuel.
- Hey.

733
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:55,622
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

734
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:57,326
Very good to meet you.

735
00:50:57,401 --> 00:50:59,392
All right. Go ahead.
Grab a seat right there, and we'll-

736
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,233
- Let me look at them.
- Yeah.

737
00:51:01,305 --> 00:51:02,636
- Beautiful. Okay.
- They look good?

738
00:51:02,706 --> 00:51:03,730
- Yeah.
- Too much?

739
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,934
- No, it's very good.
- Okay. All right.

740
00:51:06,009 --> 00:51:09,604
Cool. Well, grab a seat,
and we'll just basically, you know-

741
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,910
Manuel, trusting soul here,
he's gonna take us-

742
00:51:11,982 --> 00:51:13,142
- F.J.
- Yeah?

743
00:51:13,217 --> 00:51:15,208
- What the fuck is this, man?
- It's just a little dust.

744
00:51:15,285 --> 00:51:18,721
- We have two full HD cameras. Right?
- Yeah.

745
00:51:18,789 --> 00:51:20,206
- So this stuff is
gonna be on the scene.

746
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:21,622
- That's props. Props!

747
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:22,989
- Got it.
- Please clean it.

748
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,153
That's why I didn't like to shoot here.
This was your idea.

749
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:27,356
- That's all right. It's a great space.
- Make sure somebody cleans that.

750
00:51:27,431 --> 00:51:29,262
- I guarantee we'll take care of it.
- This is very important.

751
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:31,096
- I know it's very important for you.
- Make sure it's done right.

752
00:51:31,168 --> 00:51:32,550
We're gonna take care of it.

753
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:33,932
Why don't you grab a seat
back there and we'll begin.

754
00:51:34,004 --> 00:51:35,301
Great, thanks.

755
00:51:35,372 --> 00:51:39,274
All right. So it's real simple.
Manuel, I need a pop shot right there.

756
00:51:45,082 --> 00:51:47,277
What is that? Hmm?

757
00:51:48,552 --> 00:51:50,144
What did you get into?

758
00:52:31,862 --> 00:52:33,295
That sounds great.

759
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:36,890
We'll change the script.

760
00:52:36,967 --> 00:52:38,491
- Do you want this closed?
- Yeah.

761
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:39,797
Head on in, close the door...

762
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:41,861
and then, when I say action,
you're coming out.

763
00:52:41,939 --> 00:52:43,634
Do you want me to be dick ready, or-

764
00:52:43,707 --> 00:52:45,800
Yeah, well, just, you know,
you know, you know-

765
00:52:45,876 --> 00:52:48,470
Let it build, but keep both arms
behind the back.

766
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:50,638
Oh, perfect.

767
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:53,205
Okay, here we go.

768
00:52:53,283 --> 00:52:54,978
And...

769
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:56,542
action.

770
00:53:45,168 --> 00:53:47,659
Oh, girl. Fuck.

771
00:53:48,939 --> 00:53:51,271
I love it when you work my fuckin' cock.

772
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:07,756
Oh, yeah.

773
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:10,417
Open up to the camera, guys.

774
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:13,556
Who's my pretty bitch?

775
00:54:20,137 --> 00:54:21,627
Oh, yeah.

776
00:54:23,106 --> 00:54:26,598
Mmm. Oh.

777
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:28,167
Come here, Tess.

778
00:54:28,245 --> 00:54:30,543
Come on up. Come here. Come here.

779
00:54:30,614 --> 00:54:32,104
Yeah, fuck me.

780
00:54:35,452 --> 00:54:37,181
Fuck me, baby.

781
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:40,518
Come on, Tess. Come on.

782
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:43,788
I'm on the set. What?

783
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:45,691
Which door?

784
00:54:45,762 --> 00:54:48,060
They fixed that door Tuesday.

785
00:54:49,232 --> 00:54:50,995
No, it's all right.
I'll take a look at it.

786
00:54:51,068 --> 00:54:53,332
Just be-You're probably pressing
the wrong button.

787
00:54:53,403 --> 00:54:55,598
Oh, God!

788
00:54:55,672 --> 00:54:58,038
Tess, hair. Hair.

789
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:01,402
Oh, God!

790
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,670
- I gotta go, man.
- Okay.

791
00:55:04,748 --> 00:55:06,340
Guys, I'm gonna go.

792
00:55:06,416 --> 00:55:08,646
- Tess, you're a superstar, baby.
- Bye!

793
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:10,619
Bye. Manuel, you were great.

794
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:12,655
- Thank you.
- Thanks, man.

795
00:55:12,723 --> 00:55:15,123
Okay, guys, we're ready
for the pop shot.

796
00:55:15,192 --> 00:55:17,183
Yeah. Come here, Tess.
Come here, Tess.

797
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:23,960
Good. All right, cut.

798
00:55:24,568 --> 00:55:27,332
Hey, get them a towel, will you?

799
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:28,996
Dude, I hate you.

800
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,265
- Only for work?
- Yeah.

801
00:55:33,944 --> 00:55:35,036
- What's up?
- Hi.

802
00:55:35,112 --> 00:55:36,374
- Hi.
- I'm Asa.

803
00:55:36,446 --> 00:55:38,243
Jane. I mean Tess.

804
00:55:38,315 --> 00:55:39,646
- Jane.

805
00:55:39,716 --> 00:55:41,115
- You're new?
- Yeah.

806
00:55:41,184 --> 00:55:42,310
Nice to meet you.

807
00:55:42,386 --> 00:55:43,876
She is really good though.

808
00:55:43,954 --> 00:55:46,047
- Yeah?
- Really good.

809
00:55:46,123 --> 00:55:48,057
That must mean you're really good then.

810
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:49,889
- No, it means I'm sitting
right next to him.

811
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:51,652
- No, he's not that nice.

812
00:55:51,728 --> 00:55:54,060
I'm not that nice.

813
00:55:54,131 --> 00:55:57,157
I'm French, and it's in
my blood to be a dick.

814
00:55:57,234 --> 00:56:00,169
Okay! So I heard a funny joke today.
Want to hear it?

815
00:56:00,237 --> 00:56:02,637
Yeah, go ahead.

816
00:56:02,706 --> 00:56:04,071
What-

817
00:56:04,808 --> 00:56:06,503
- Wait.
- She's always bad with jokes.

818
00:56:06,576 --> 00:56:07,907
Hold on, hold on!

819
00:56:07,978 --> 00:56:11,175
What's worse than getting fingered by-

820
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:15,181
- No, hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
- This is the worst ever.

821
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:17,243
- Whatever. Whatever. It's ruined.
- What will it be? Come on.

822
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,753
- Make us laugh!
- No, no, no.

823
00:56:18,822 --> 00:56:21,347
Oh! I remember. I remember. It's-

824
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:25,828
What's worse then getting banged
byJack the Ripper?

825
00:56:27,564 --> 00:56:31,193
- Oh, God.
- Getting fingered by Captain Hook.

826
00:56:36,306 --> 00:56:38,934
But that would probably
make you squirt 'cause it's like-

827
00:56:39,810 --> 00:56:42,335
Oh, shit, guys, I have to go.
I've got to get my makeup off.

828
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:44,778
- Nice to meet you, Shadow.
- We've got to work together.

829
00:56:44,848 --> 00:56:45,929
- Nice to meet you.

830
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:47,009
- Nice to meet you.
I'll probably see you around.

831
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:49,109
- Good working with you.
- You too.

832
00:56:50,587 --> 00:56:53,317
I was just at the dentist...

833
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:56,723
and my whole entire
this side of my mouth is numb right now.

834
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:59,489
I can't feel it, and I
think I might drool.

835
00:56:59,563 --> 00:57:01,053
Drool!

836
00:57:01,131 --> 00:57:02,195
- I'm gonna pull the car
around to the front.

837
00:57:02,196 --> 00:57:03,258
- Okay.

838
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:04,322
- I'll see you outside?
- Okay.

839
00:57:04,401 --> 00:57:05,959
Okay.

840
00:57:07,337 --> 00:57:09,100
Let's go. You're in a fire lane.

841
00:57:09,172 --> 00:57:11,140
Yeah, yeah. I'm moving.

842
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:13,176
- No, you need to go. Come on.
- Just two seconds, sir.

843
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:15,268
- Lady, look at all these cars here.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

844
00:57:15,345 --> 00:57:17,142
I'm just- I'm waiting for my-
She's old.

845
00:57:17,214 --> 00:57:19,739
I don't care if she's 90.
You need to get your car out of the way.

846
00:57:19,816 --> 00:57:20,897
- Please?

847
00:57:20,898 --> 00:57:21,977
- Circle the block so
I don't lose my job.

848
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:23,246
Oh, fine.

849
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:43,695
Oh, come on!

850
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:53,415
Move!

851
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:57,911
- Learn how to drive, bitch!
- Really?

852
00:58:09,332 --> 00:58:10,822
Shit.

853
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:12,891
I just shooed her off
a couple minutes ago.

854
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:15,631
- She probably went that way.
- Dude! Fuck. Shit.

855
00:58:15,705 --> 00:58:17,366
- Come on, let's go.
- Thanks.

856
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,375
Are you kidding me?

857
00:58:32,455 --> 00:58:35,015
What the fuck are you doing?

858
00:58:35,826 --> 00:58:37,316
Get in the car!

859
00:58:39,596 --> 00:58:41,723
Sadie, get in the car.

860
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:56,438
I can't believe you thought
I would leave you.

861
00:58:56,513 --> 00:58:59,038
What-What were you trying to do?

862
00:58:59,115 --> 00:59:02,414
You were gonna walk home?
Are you insane?

863
00:59:04,821 --> 00:59:06,311
Jesus.

864
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:54,459
For the dog.

- Hey.

- How'd the shoot go?

867
01:00:10,787 --> 01:00:12,652
- Really well, actually.
- Good.

868
01:00:12,722 --> 01:00:14,815
Did Arash ask about me?

869
01:00:14,891 --> 01:00:18,952
Uh, no, I didn't really have a chance
to talk to him.

870
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:22,054
- Jane?
- Yeah.

871
01:00:23,233 --> 01:00:25,326
- What?
- Never mind.

872
01:00:26,169 --> 01:00:27,761
Okay.

873
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:35,934
Hey, did you see lots of those in Paris?

874
01:00:36,012 --> 01:00:37,877
I've never been there.

875
01:00:37,948 --> 01:00:39,609
What do you mean
you've never been there?

876
01:00:39,683 --> 01:00:41,548
I've never been to Paris.

877
01:00:41,618 --> 01:00:45,019
- But you-You said you love Paris.
- I do.

878
01:00:45,088 --> 01:00:49,081
There's a movie
with Astaire and Hepburn...

879
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:50,922
and they're dancing in the streets.

880
01:00:50,994 --> 01:00:54,088
I don't remember the name.
That's my favorite.

881
01:00:54,998 --> 01:00:56,863
Yeah.

882
01:00:58,835 --> 01:01:03,135
You are one tough cookie to read.
I will tell you that, Sadie.

883
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:10,576
Well, is this baby the only man
in your life?

884
01:01:11,614 --> 01:01:13,206
Mmm.

885
01:01:13,283 --> 01:01:15,376
I don't know. It's complicated.

886
01:01:18,855 --> 01:01:24,725
Like, my work,
it doesn't really allow for it.

887
01:01:24,794 --> 01:01:29,322
Well, don't seem like
a very strenuous schedule that you have.

888
01:01:33,603 --> 01:01:37,562
- What about you?
- What about me what?

889
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,608
Oh, I don't work. I'm- No.

890
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:42,474
No, no, no, What about dating?

891
01:01:43,646 --> 01:01:47,104
Oh.

892
01:01:47,183 --> 01:01:51,620
My first, last date with my Franky...

893
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:56,091
was when we went to the
Los Angeles Zoo...

894
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:57,717
and he proposed.

895
01:01:58,895 --> 01:02:01,022
That's really cute.

896
01:02:02,298 --> 01:02:03,993
I want that.

897
01:02:06,136 --> 01:02:07,125
Yeah.

898
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:13,034
- Let's go.
- What? Why? We just got here.

899
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:15,543
No! Let's go to the zoo.

900
01:02:15,612 --> 01:02:17,671
I wanna go to the zoo.

901
01:02:17,747 --> 01:02:20,875
- We could revisit where
you and Frank first got it on-

902
01:02:20,950 --> 01:02:24,113
and then, I don't know.

903
01:02:24,187 --> 01:02:27,418
I mean, a gorilla could propose to me
for all we know.

904
01:02:28,425 --> 01:02:32,054
Come on. It's a road trip.
It's just right over the hill.

905
01:02:54,717 --> 01:02:57,447
It closed in 1 965.

906
01:02:58,988 --> 01:03:00,478
Sorry.

907
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:02,388
We can go find the new one.

908
01:03:02,459 --> 01:03:04,689
But this is the one we came to.

909
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:31,185
So when was the last time
you left the Valley?

910
01:03:32,288 --> 01:03:34,483
I suppose it was a long time ago.

911
01:03:37,527 --> 01:03:39,017
Yeah.

912
01:04:01,985 --> 01:04:05,045
Sorry. Maybe that
wasn't such a hot idea.

913
01:04:06,222 --> 01:04:08,520
Well- Hmm.

914
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:16,958
Hmm.

915
01:04:18,201 --> 01:04:21,068
Hey, do you want to
Star-sit next weekend?

916
01:04:21,137 --> 01:04:23,128
Do- Do what?

917
01:04:24,207 --> 01:04:26,004
Dog-sit Starlet.

918
01:04:26,643 --> 01:04:29,771
I mean, I have a job,
and I can't really bring him, so-

919
01:04:30,613 --> 01:04:32,478
I don't know.

920
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:33,538
Okay.

921
01:04:45,428 --> 01:04:46,918
Bye.

922
01:05:05,915 --> 01:05:07,405
Hey. Wanna tan?

923
01:05:07,483 --> 01:05:10,748
No. Wait, you got your car back.

924
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,202
- Sure did.

925
01:05:12,203 --> 01:05:13,584
- But I thought you
didn't have the money.

926
01:05:15,191 --> 01:05:18,217
Wait, so is this-

927
01:05:19,028 --> 01:05:21,394
Are you doing this, like, regularly?

928
01:05:22,332 --> 01:05:24,493
Yeah. What's the big deal?

929
01:05:25,268 --> 01:05:27,133
You've never taken a private?

930
01:05:27,203 --> 01:05:28,261
No.

931
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:33,800
Well, when you're ready,
I'll hook you up.

932
01:05:33,876 --> 01:05:36,276
Don't go through Mikey.
He'll take 50%.

933
01:05:52,562 --> 01:05:55,759
Can I ask you why you're
holding on to all these newspapers?

934
01:05:55,832 --> 01:05:57,766
There are articles in there that I save.

935
01:05:57,834 --> 01:06:00,302
Would you mind explaining
what's happening in the fireplace?

936
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:05,307
That's my-Another place
that I keep things that-that I refer to.

937
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:06,689
And then we have
the tree outside.

938
01:06:06,690 --> 01:06:08,003
It's overgrown.
We have to trim that back.

939
01:06:08,077 --> 01:06:10,910
Wait! I don't want anybody
touching my tree. That's my tree.

940
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,175
We're not gonna cut it down.
We're just gonna trim it back.

941
01:06:13,249 --> 01:06:15,615
These are the people I
was telling you about.

942
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:18,882
Ms. Perkins, you have to clean this up,
or you're gonna face another lawsuit.

943
01:06:18,955 --> 01:06:21,014
I already had my yard sale...

944
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:23,684
and I had the lawn mowed
and I had it all cleaned-

945
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:25,591
You're gonna have
to have a bigger yard sale.

946
01:06:25,662 --> 01:06:27,596
Okay?

947
01:06:27,664 --> 01:06:29,393
- Number one, you said
you have no visitors.

948
01:06:29,394 --> 01:06:31,122
- I don't have any visitors.

949
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,259
You have a visitor right here!

950
01:06:33,336 --> 01:06:35,964
You can lose your fucking attitude,
number one.

951
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:37,638
- She is trying to help.

952
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:39,236
- I'm sorry, but it seems like
you're the one with the attitude.

953
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:42,142
- Okay, ladies. We should go.
- Yeah, I think it's time to go.

954
01:06:42,211 --> 01:06:44,941
- Yeah, I think it is.
- Hmm. Sorry.

955
01:06:48,618 --> 01:06:50,950
I hope she trips and falls.

956
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:52,885
If he's being good,
you can give him snacks.

957
01:06:52,955 --> 01:06:55,185
- Okay.
- And then-

958
01:06:55,258 --> 01:06:57,556
- He can play with that little toy?
- Yeah.

959
01:06:57,627 --> 01:06:58,787
Okay.

960
01:06:58,861 --> 01:07:00,351
I'm off. I have to go.

961
01:07:11,174 --> 01:07:12,732
All right, here we go.

962
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:15,505
Are you nervous?

963
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:19,605
- Not really. Should I be?
- No. I am a little bit.

964
01:07:19,682 --> 01:07:23,174
Fucking Jules's booth
is three times larger than ours.

965
01:07:23,252 --> 01:07:25,812
This is downtown L.A., not Vegas.

966
01:07:50,313 --> 01:07:55,114
If you've done your job right, your
face is gonna be hurting by tonight.

967
01:07:55,184 --> 01:07:56,947
What? Why?

968
01:07:57,854 --> 01:08:00,220
Smiling.

969
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:02,785
You a good boy?

970
01:08:04,994 --> 01:08:08,191
I bet you miss your mommy,
don't you? Huh?

971
01:08:13,202 --> 01:08:14,760
- Tess.
- Hi.

972
01:08:14,837 --> 01:08:16,236
How are you guys doing today?

973
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:17,602
- You're a fan?
- Yeah.

974
01:08:17,673 --> 01:08:20,141
Do you do any girl-on-girl scenes?

975
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:22,473
You have a beautiful vagina.

976
01:08:22,545 --> 01:08:24,342
- I'm so happy.
- Fabulous.

977
01:08:24,414 --> 01:08:26,644
She thanks you.

978
01:08:26,716 --> 01:08:29,150
- Here.
- Thank you, baby.

979
01:08:29,218 --> 01:08:31,243
- She has like that much left.
- Okay.

980
01:08:32,422 --> 01:08:35,255
I mean, what I can do is, if-

981
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:37,451
I'll just make sure.
Like, if it does run, then I'll go-

982
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:39,650
Hi.

983
01:08:39,729 --> 01:08:42,254
- What's your name?
- I'm Joey.

984
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:43,923
- Pardon?
- Joey.

985
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,092
- Joey?
- Yeah.

986
01:08:45,168 --> 01:08:47,636
- Nice to meet you. Tess.
- Hi.

987
01:08:47,703 --> 01:08:49,000
How's your day?

988
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:51,130
- Good.
- Yeah?

989
01:08:51,207 --> 01:08:53,175
They said I could have
a picture with you.

990
01:08:53,242 --> 01:08:55,006
- I would love to have
a picture with you.

991
01:08:55,007 --> 01:08:56,769
- Okay.

992
01:09:04,754 --> 01:09:06,244
Starlet.

993
01:09:11,093 --> 01:09:12,082
Starlet?

994
01:09:13,629 --> 01:09:14,618
Oh.

995
01:09:18,434 --> 01:09:19,765
Starlet?

996
01:09:20,903 --> 01:09:22,632
Oh, shit.

997
01:09:22,705 --> 01:09:24,195
Take care.

998
01:09:29,178 --> 01:09:30,167
Oh.

999
01:09:30,246 --> 01:09:32,612
- I'm so proud of you.
- I'm exhausted.

1000
01:09:32,682 --> 01:09:35,344
- You know what I was thinking?
- Yeah.

1001
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:38,819
We do a couple more
of these next-door-girl things...

1002
01:09:38,888 --> 01:09:40,856
and then we fix your tits.

1003
01:09:40,923 --> 01:09:42,413
Okay.

1004
01:09:42,492 --> 01:09:43,982
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1005
01:09:44,527 --> 01:09:45,608
- Kind of scared.

1006
01:09:45,609 --> 01:09:46,688
- I know this great
doctor in Beverly Hills.

1007
01:09:46,762 --> 01:09:48,024
Yeah?

1008
01:09:53,269 --> 01:09:54,964
Starlet!

1009
01:09:56,305 --> 01:09:57,602
Hello.

1010
01:09:57,673 --> 01:09:59,004
Have you seen-

1011
01:09:59,075 --> 01:10:00,838
I've lost my little dog.

1012
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:02,400
- Vanessa?
- <i>Que?</i>

1013
01:10:04,046 --> 01:10:06,640
- What?
- Did you see a little dog?

1014
01:10:06,716 --> 01:10:08,741
- No, I haven't seen a dog.
- A little Chihuahua?

1015
01:10:08,818 --> 01:10:11,844
- No, I have not.
- Oh, crap.

1016
01:10:17,894 --> 01:10:19,384
Starlet!

1017
01:10:28,938 --> 01:10:30,462
Starlet!

1018
01:10:35,878 --> 01:10:37,539
Jules, what's up man?
Good to see you.

1019
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:38,705
Hi!

1020
01:10:38,781 --> 01:10:40,408
- How are you?
- Good.

1021
01:10:40,483 --> 01:10:42,110
How are you, baby?

1022
01:10:42,184 --> 01:10:43,742
Baby, let's go.

1023
01:10:44,253 --> 01:10:45,948
So anyway's, yeah.

1024
01:10:46,022 --> 01:10:51,016
Actually, I just, like,
came by to talk to you about Melissa.

1025
01:10:51,093 --> 01:10:52,709
And I, you know- I
understand why you did

1026
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:54,324
it, but she's doing,
like, a lot better-

1027
01:10:54,397 --> 01:10:56,262
Where is Melissa? Is she here?

1028
01:10:57,533 --> 01:10:59,000
What the fuck is she doing here, man?

1029
01:10:59,068 --> 01:11:00,126
Can she at least sign...

1030
01:11:00,202 --> 01:11:01,999
- a few pictures for the fans?
- No, she can't.

1031
01:11:02,071 --> 01:11:03,060
Is she fucked up again?

1032
01:11:03,139 --> 01:11:04,629
All her fucking DVD's are out here-

1033
01:11:04,707 --> 01:11:06,732
What is that fucking red hair?

1034
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:09,073
I told her not to do it.

1035
01:11:09,145 --> 01:11:11,477
I told her, and I'm telling you.
She's frozen for a month.

1036
01:11:11,547 --> 01:11:14,107
- You gotta get her out of here now.
- Melissa.

1037
01:11:14,183 --> 01:11:16,481
We got-We gotta go.
We gotta go.

1038
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:18,144
Just fucking move away
from your table.

1039
01:11:19,956 --> 01:11:23,756
Look, I fucking totally understand
your problems with her.

1040
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:26,192
I have all the same fucking problems
with her that you do...

1041
01:11:26,262 --> 01:11:29,663
and I don't want that
to affect our working relationship.

1042
01:11:29,732 --> 01:11:31,393
That'd be fucking no good with me.

1043
01:11:33,803 --> 01:11:35,134
Zana?

1044
01:11:35,204 --> 01:11:37,638
That's why I want to talk to you.
I have a good idea.

1045
01:11:37,707 --> 01:11:39,868
You know X-Men?
We could do fucking Triple-X-Men.

1046
01:11:39,942 --> 01:11:43,105
I'd play Wolverine.
It would be so sick.

1047
01:11:43,179 --> 01:11:44,345
- It would be so awesome.
Think about it.

1048
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:45,511
- Is that a fact?

1049
01:11:45,581 --> 01:11:49,347
Yeah! I used to be a purple belt,
so like, the physicality-

1050

Renegade does no parodies.

1051
01:11:52,021 --> 01:11:53,955
Ooh, get my butt.
My butt looks really good in this.

1052
01:11:54,023 --> 01:11:55,684
- Can I get a picture of your butt?
- Yeah.

1053
01:11:55,758 --> 01:11:57,851
Let me just-

1054
01:11:57,927 --> 01:12:00,418
If you want to talk to me,
you come back, talk to me on first.

1055
01:12:00,496 --> 01:12:02,691
Now you go get her
and get the fuck out of here.

1056
01:12:02,765 --> 01:12:04,511
- Go. Now.

1057
01:12:04,512 --> 01:12:06,257
- Thanks, man.
I really fucking appreciate it.

1058
01:12:09,338 --> 01:12:11,169

get the fuck out of here.

That girl is bad news.
I don't want to see you with her.

I live with her.

1062
01:12:21,784 --> 01:12:23,274
So don't live with her anymore.

Absolutely not.

- What can't you handle?

1075
01:13:45,434 --> 01:13:47,299
Just take him.

01:18:19,775 --> 01:18:21,106
What question?

1165
01:18:21,176 --> 01:18:23,303
You know, the one about the money.

1166
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:27,145
I think, if I were you...

1167
01:18:27,216 --> 01:18:30,481
I would spend it on someone
that I really cared about.

1168

On someone who really needed it.

1169

01:19:22,838 --> 01:19:25,807
Wait, I'm sorry. I just said we had
two first-class tickets to Paris...

1185
01:19:25,874 --> 01:19:28,308
- and that's what you have to say?
- I'm not going anywhere with you.

1186
01:19:28,377 --> 01:19:30,345
I can't leave the country. I'm too old.

1187
01:19:31,013 --> 01:19:33,243
- And besides, I don't have a passport.
- Twenty-three.

1188
01:19:33,315 --> 01:19:34,748
Okay, excuse me.

1189
01:19:34,817 --> 01:19:37,615
Number one, passport's not an issue.

1190
01:19:37,686 --> 01:19:39,449
There's an expediting service.

1191
01:19:39,521 --> 01:19:42,957
Number two, I spent eight grand on this.
You don't have a choice.

1192
01:19:43,025 --> 01:19:44,493
- Where'd you get the money?

1193
01:19:44,494 --> 01:19:45,960
- It doesn't matter
where I got the money.

1194
01:19:46,028 --> 01:19:47,290
- I mean-
- That's insane.

1195
01:19:47,362 --> 01:19:49,387
I'm not going to Paris with you.

1196
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:58,401

01:19:58,474 --> 01:20:00,533
Listen.

1198
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:02,804
I will make you a wager.

1199
01:20:02,878 --> 01:20:07,781
I will play the next game of Bingo,
and if I win, then you're coming.

1200
01:20:08,484 --> 01:20:10,543

1201

- Bingo!

1202

- Bingo called.
- Look. Game over.

1203
01:20:15,891 --> 01:20:17,381
I'll take that as a ''yes.''

1204
01:20:17,459 --> 01:20:20,189
Are there any others?
Are there any others?

1205
01:20:21,263 --> 01:20:23,595

I need the maximum amount of packs.

1208
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:31,366
Twenty-five packs will be $1 7 5.

1209
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,375
You realize the most
you can win is $1 50?

1210
01:20:34,443 --> 01:20:37,435
- Okay, 200.
- Okay.

1211
01:20:37,513 --> 01:20:40,141
- Uh, your change?
- No, it's fine. Thank you.

1212
01:20:44,753 --> 01:20:48,553
You are totally insane. Crazy.

1213
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:57,195
N-36.

1214
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:04,129
O-7 5.

1215
01:21:05,807 --> 01:21:08,071
O-7 1.

1216
01:21:08,143 --> 01:21:09,201
Fuck.

1217
01:21:13,315 --> 01:21:15,681
Sit down. You're embarrassing me.

1218
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:22,318
O-72.

1219
01:21:22,391 --> 01:21:23,915
B-2.

1220
01:21:23,992 --> 01:21:25,687
G-47.

1221
01:21:25,761 --> 01:21:27,251
D-1 1.

1222
01:21:33,835 --> 01:21:36,360
- I've got-
- N-37.

1223
01:21:36,438 --> 01:21:38,065
I've got Bingo.

1224
01:21:40,609 --> 01:21:42,338
I've got Bingo.

1225
01:21:42,911 --> 01:21:44,401
No.

1226
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:46,504
Me! Bingo! Bingo!

1227
01:21:46,582 --> 01:21:50,109
- Me! Bingo!
- There's a Bingo out there.

1228
01:21:50,185 --> 01:21:52,710
Congratulations, Sadie.

1229
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:54,881
- Thank you.
- It's been a while.

1230
01:21:56,558 --> 01:21:59,026
I just did it.

1231
01:21:59,094 --> 01:22:00,925
And you lost.

1232
01:22:00,996 --> 01:22:03,464
Look at all this stuff, and you lost.

1233
01:22:03,532 --> 01:22:05,056
But you never win!

1234
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:07,727
I did today.

1235
01:22:07,803 --> 01:22:09,327
- I won.
- 0-69.

1236
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:13,439
Does this mean you're
not coming to Paris?

1237
01:22:16,645 --> 01:22:17,634
Oh.

1238
01:22:17,713 --> 01:22:19,943
B-1 0.

1239
01:22:20,515 --> 01:22:23,541
- Mmm.
- Mmm?

1240
01:22:24,119 --> 01:22:26,815
- Mm-mmm.
- Mmm.

1241
01:22:26,888 --> 01:22:28,822
I know that one.

1242
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:31,450
B-2.

1243
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:36,019
<i>- Pop ]</i>

1244
01:22:36,098 --> 01:22:38,464
- Hey.
- Hey.

1245
01:22:38,533 --> 01:22:40,467
Oh, Mikey's using your room.

1246
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:47,167
Yeah, suck that shit. Yeah.

1247
01:22:47,242 --> 01:22:50,006
My turn.

1248
01:22:53,382 --> 01:22:56,146
Mm-hmm, yeah. Gimme the tongue!

1249
01:23:00,222 --> 01:23:02,588
Whoo.

1250
01:23:02,658 --> 01:23:04,489
Oh, the bathroom's over here.

1251
01:23:04,559 --> 01:23:06,356
- Mikey. Mikey.
- Hold on a second!

1252
01:23:07,496 --> 01:23:08,986
I really need to rinse off!

1253
01:23:09,064 --> 01:23:10,549
Okay, there's a towel
in there, but don't use

1254
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:12,033
the good towels.
Don't use the white towel.

1255
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,227
- Did you use the bed?
- No, I didn't use the bed.

1256
01:23:14,303 --> 01:23:17,067
- One towel?
- Yeah for both of you. Sorry.

1257
01:23:17,139 --> 01:23:20,370
No, I didn't use the bed.
It was a fuckin' P.O.V. B.J.

1258
01:23:20,442 --> 01:23:22,103
Why can't you just use that room?

1259
01:23:22,177 --> 01:23:23,974
I can't use that room.
I've shot that room out.

1260
01:23:24,046 --> 01:23:25,707
I need the fucking yellow walls in here.

1261
01:23:25,781 --> 01:23:28,079
You know what I'm gonna do in here,
is I'm gonna paint.

1262
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:29,800
I'm gonna paint black
and white polka dots.

1263
01:23:29,801 --> 01:23:31,449
It's gonna be fuckin' awesome.

1264
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,078
When you guys get done,
meet me downstairs...

1265
01:23:33,155 --> 01:23:35,123
so fucking everybody
can get paid, all right?

1266
01:23:37,092 --> 01:23:39,720
- Jesus.

1267
01:23:39,795 --> 01:23:42,423
- What agency are you with?
- I'm with 1 01.

1268
01:23:42,497 --> 01:23:44,863
Oh, okay. Yeah, okay.

1269
01:23:46,468 --> 01:23:48,299
What is this?

1270
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:50,031
That's my luggage.

1271
01:23:51,473 --> 01:23:52,963
Can you get it?

1272
01:23:53,041 --> 01:23:55,339
This thing is older than you are.

1273
01:23:55,410 --> 01:23:57,901
- It works.
- Okay.

1274
01:23:57,979 --> 01:24:00,675
- This dress.
- Okay.

1275
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:03,750
And then that.

1276
01:24:03,819 --> 01:24:05,810
I see this for Paris.

1277
01:24:06,822 --> 01:24:07,846
Okay.

1278
01:24:07,923 --> 01:24:10,016
- This!
- What?

1279
01:24:11,526 --> 01:24:13,517
And I should wear this one.

1280
01:24:13,595 --> 01:24:15,085
Right?

1281
01:24:16,164 --> 01:24:18,496
- Is it okay?
- Yeah.

1282
01:24:18,567 --> 01:24:22,094
No Frenchman can resist some Leopard.

1283
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:25,037
- All right, if you say so.
- I do.

1284
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:28,541
I hear the Frenchmen
can be quite the lovers.

1285
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:30,202
Are they really?

1286
01:24:30,278 --> 01:24:31,768
They'll love you.

1287
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:42,552
Hey, what are you doing?

1288
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,114
Packing.

1289
01:24:44,192 --> 01:24:46,786
I'm going-
I'm going away this week.

1290
01:24:46,862 --> 01:24:49,490
Yeah? Where are you going?

1291
01:24:49,564 --> 01:24:52,032
We're going to Paris, actually.

1292
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:54,295
Paris? With who?

1293
01:24:54,369 --> 01:24:56,564
Uh, that woman, Sadie.

1294
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,930
On whose dime?

1295
01:25:01,443 --> 01:25:02,933
Mine.

1296
01:25:18,393 --> 01:25:20,918
Bull-fucking-shit!

1297
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:23,393
- What?
- Bullshit!

1298
01:25:24,299 --> 01:25:26,824
- Get out of there!
- Where is the fuckin' money?

1299
01:25:26,902 --> 01:25:29,427
Why are you going through my shit?

1300
01:25:29,504 --> 01:25:31,904
You fuckin' spent all the fuckin' money?

1301
01:25:31,973 --> 01:25:34,407
- Why did you go through my shit?
- Starlet showed it to me.

1302
01:25:34,476 --> 01:25:35,841
- Oh, you just blame
my fucking dog?

1303
01:25:35,842 --> 01:25:37,206
- No, the fucking dog
doesn't matter, Jane.

1304
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:39,110
I can't believe you just spent
all the fucking money.

1305
01:25:39,181 --> 01:25:41,172
- What did you expect?
- What do you mean, what did I expect?

1306
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:43,979
I didn't expect you to spend
the fucking money to go to Paris...

1307
01:25:44,052 --> 01:25:46,282
with some fuckin' old bitch.

1308
01:25:46,354 --> 01:25:50,120
I expected you to spend the money on us,
on me, on your fucking real friends!

1309
01:25:50,192 --> 01:25:51,454
- Oh, really?
- Yeah!

1310
01:25:51,526 --> 01:25:53,426
- Really?
- Of course!

1311
01:25:53,495 --> 01:25:56,157
Like I've been doing
for fucking months, Melissa? Like that?

1312
01:25:56,231 --> 01:25:57,823
You let my car get taken away.

1313
01:25:57,899 --> 01:25:59,924
You let me make a fool out of myself
at Renegade.

1314
01:26:00,001 --> 01:26:03,562
Not to mention Arash
is bad-mouthing me all over town.

1315
01:26:03,638 --> 01:26:06,607
And now you decide to go
on a fucking vacation...

1316
01:26:06,675 --> 01:26:08,165
and you don't even bring me?

1317
01:26:08,243 --> 01:26:10,177
You go on a fucking vacation?
Some fucking friend you are!

1318
01:26:10,245 --> 01:26:13,646
Melissa! It is so much more complicated
than that, and you know it!

1319
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:16,377
<i>Why don't you wear a knee brace?</i>

1320
01:26:16,451 --> 01:26:19,682
<i>Mmm, shut up, Greg Why don't you</i>
<i>play with somethin'down the street?</i>

1321
01:26:19,754 --> 01:26:22,222
You think I'm so fucking stupid!

1322
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:25,225
- Yeah, you are fucking stupid!
- You're the fucking stupid one!

1323
01:26:25,293 --> 01:26:27,989
- Stay away from me.
- It's not even your fucking money!

1324
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:30,623
It's the old bitch's money!

1325
01:26:30,699 --> 01:26:32,564
- Yeah, bitch!
- Fuck off.

1326
01:26:32,634 --> 01:26:35,398
Go back to fucking Jacksonville, whore!

1327
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:36,801
Get out!

1328
01:26:38,707 --> 01:26:41,005
- Get the fuck out of my room!
- Hey, hey.

1329
01:26:41,076 --> 01:26:42,509
Stop it. Stop, stop.

1330
01:26:42,577 --> 01:26:45,068
- She is fucking done here, man.
- Go pop some more oxy.

1331
01:26:45,146 --> 01:26:48,274
Pack your bags, bitch.
You're fuckin' outta here!

1332
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:49,482
- Shut-

1333
01:26:49,483 --> 01:26:50,614
- You know what?
I don't fucking like it here anyway.

1334
01:26:50,685 --> 01:26:54,052
- Shut up! Shut up!
- We're the best you ever had.

1335
01:26:54,122 --> 01:26:55,282
- Okay, shut up.
- Get out.

1336
01:26:55,357 --> 01:26:57,257
Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

1337
01:26:57,325 --> 01:26:59,156
- Get her out of my room.
- Listen to me.

1338
01:26:59,227 --> 01:27:00,888
We have neighbors.
Shut your fucking mouth.

1339
01:27:00,962 --> 01:27:02,361
- Get her out of my-
- Mikey?

1340
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:04,864
- Get out of here.
- Get her out of my room.

1341
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:06,594
- Get out!
- Get out of my-

1342
01:27:08,303 --> 01:27:09,634
Fuck!

1343
01:27:11,973 --> 01:27:13,463
Come here, okay?

1344
01:27:15,877 --> 01:27:18,107
It's okay. It's okay, Starlet.

1345
01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:20,113
Twelve hundred bucks
is walking out the fucking door!

1346
01:27:20,181 --> 01:27:21,170
And you know what?

1347
01:27:21,249 --> 01:27:22,831
I'm not going to be able
to put another bitch

1348
01:27:22,832 --> 01:27:24,412
up in there for at
least a fucking month.

1349
01:27:24,486 --> 01:27:25,976
Are you gonna- Listen to me.

1350
01:27:26,054 --> 01:27:27,453
- Are you gonna
fuckin' pay for it?

1351
01:27:27,454 --> 01:27:28,852
- You gonna live with
a liar and a cheat?

1352
01:27:28,924 --> 01:27:31,757
I don't give a fuck what she is,
but she pays fucking rent.

1353
01:27:31,826 --> 01:27:33,544
- Now how are we gonna-

1354
01:27:33,545 --> 01:27:35,262
- So what? Shh, baby, baby- I can
afford this place on my own.

1355
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:37,423
I've been doing enough privates.
We'll be fine.

1356
01:27:37,499 --> 01:27:41,265
Jesus fucking Christ, Melissa!
Are you shitting me?

1357
01:27:41,336 --> 01:27:43,896
You've been booking privates
behind my back?

1358
01:27:43,972 --> 01:27:45,462
You're kidding me, right?

1359
01:27:46,942 --> 01:27:48,432
What did you expect?

1360
01:27:50,946 --> 01:27:52,641
It's everything I borrowed.

1361
01:27:52,714 --> 01:27:55,547
Unlike some people,
I return money that isn't mine.

1362
01:29:04,886 --> 01:29:06,751
- Father, tell him I wanna play.
- Hold on a second.

1363
01:29:06,821 --> 01:29:08,880
You can't. You don't know how!

1364
01:29:08,957 --> 01:29:10,982
Mona, can you watch the kids
for two minutes, please?

1365
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:12,993
Let me finish this phone call.

1366
01:29:13,061 --> 01:29:15,723
Yes. I'll make a couple calls.
I'll get you a house.

1367
01:29:15,797 --> 01:29:18,265
Don't worry about it.
This is for good.

1368
01:29:18,333 --> 01:29:20,062
This way is much better for you.

1369
01:29:20,135 --> 01:29:21,625
Gracie.

1370
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:25,439
- Yo, Gracie!
- What?

1371
01:29:26,207 --> 01:29:29,074
Your girl's here.

1372
01:29:29,144 --> 01:29:31,408
Hi. I'm Tess.

1373
01:29:31,479 --> 01:29:34,243
You're late. Come on.
I'll show you to your room.

1374
01:29:34,315 --> 01:29:36,579
There is no smoking in the house.
Go on the patio.

1375
01:29:37,252 --> 01:29:39,083
This is my room if you need anything.

1376
01:29:39,154 --> 01:29:40,849
This is Mark's room.

1377
01:29:40,922 --> 01:29:42,913
Don't even knock on his door.

1378
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:45,585
You good? 'Kay.

1379
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:47,628
I don't know if Arash
wants you doing any webcam or not...

1380
01:29:47,696 --> 01:29:50,563
but if he does, put
it on the schedule...

1381
01:29:50,632 --> 01:29:52,532
so I don't have any conflicts.

1382
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,090
This is your room.

1383
01:29:55,103 --> 01:29:58,231
Don't let your dog pee in the house, and
label anything you put in the fridge.

1384
01:29:58,306 --> 01:30:00,433
<i>Pop, Faint ]</i>

1385
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:35,305
Thank you, Rommel. Love you.

1386
01:30:36,277 --> 01:30:41,408
Oh, yes. Of course I'll do some
fully nude ass-shaking for you, Eros.

1387
01:30:42,817 --> 01:30:45,650
Buy those tokens, guys!

1388
01:31:01,136 --> 01:31:02,433
<i>- Rock Ballad ]</i>

1389
01:31:02,434 --> 01:31:03,730
- Oh, God.
I'm praying that you pull this off.

1390
01:31:03,805 --> 01:31:05,295
Oh, Jesus, help. Nope.

1391
01:31:05,373 --> 01:31:07,170
Fuckin'Jesus doesn't exist.

1392
01:31:09,577 --> 01:31:12,444
Great job, Melissa. Great job.

1393
01:31:12,981 --> 01:31:15,882
I'm glad I wasted
all this fucking money...

1394
01:31:17,452 --> 01:31:20,683
putting this in
so you can fucking learn how to do this!

1395
01:31:20,755 --> 01:31:22,245
Where are you going?

1396
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:25,688
Really?

1397
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,523
Okay. Have fun.

1398
01:32:17,645 --> 01:32:19,135
Hello.

1399
01:32:21,649 --> 01:32:24,914
Hey, remember me?
I'm Jane's friend.

1400
01:32:24,986 --> 01:32:26,886
Anyway, I was just
coming by to tell you...

1401
01:32:26,955 --> 01:32:29,549
that the only reason
whyJane's hanging out with you...

1402
01:32:29,624 --> 01:32:31,785
is 'cause she has a bunch of your money.

1403
01:32:32,694 --> 01:32:35,492
I don't know how she got it,
but I know she has it.

1404
01:32:35,563 --> 01:32:36,621
Mmm.

1405
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,225
Yeah, and-

1406
01:32:43,638 --> 01:32:45,799
At first I thought
she was hanging out with you...

1407
01:32:45,874 --> 01:32:48,434
'cause she felt sorry for you.

1408
01:32:48,509 --> 01:32:49,840
You know, pitied you.

1409
01:32:49,911 --> 01:32:53,403
Some old lady, probably
going to die soon.

1410
01:32:53,481 --> 01:32:55,278
Then I realized...

1411
01:32:55,350 --> 01:32:59,582
she just felt guilty
for taking your money.

1412
01:33:01,723 --> 01:33:03,554
She's not your friend.

1413
01:33:06,461 --> 01:33:08,793
Just thought you should know the truth.

1414
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:16,463
Okay. Well, so I'll see you around.

1415
01:33:16,537 --> 01:33:18,027
Bye.

1416
01:35:02,477 --> 01:35:03,967
Sadie?

1417
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,504
Hi.

1418
01:35:08,983 --> 01:35:11,144
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1419
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:12,948
You look nice.

1420
01:35:17,325 --> 01:35:19,088
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

1421
01:35:26,667 --> 01:35:28,532
It's not that bad.

1422
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:31,231
Lets the sun in.

1423
01:35:35,643 --> 01:35:37,304
Oh, wait. Almost forgot.

1424
01:35:47,188 --> 01:35:49,418
Hey, you're okay, right?

1425
01:35:50,491 --> 01:35:52,425
It's gonna be fun.

1426
01:35:54,695 --> 01:35:58,290
Can we stop at the cemetery
on the way to the airport?

1427
01:35:59,634 --> 01:36:02,296
Uh, I don't know if we have time.

1428
01:36:02,370 --> 01:36:05,066
It only takes a minute.
It's right on the way.

1429
01:36:07,141 --> 01:36:08,972
Hey, you know,
we're cutting it kind of close.

1430
01:36:09,043 --> 01:36:11,477
Are you sure you don't want to do this
when we get back?

1431
01:36:13,214 --> 01:36:15,273
It's all right. We'll be okay.

1432
01:36:51,252 --> 01:36:53,618
We're-We're here.

1433
01:36:53,688 --> 01:36:55,349
Could you do this?

1434
01:36:57,091 --> 01:36:58,752
You'll be faster than me.

1435
01:37:04,432 --> 01:37:06,900
Yeah. Okay.

1436
01:37:06,968 --> 01:37:08,458
Here. Hold Starlet.
