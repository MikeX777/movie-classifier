THE NIKKATSU CORPORATION
PRESENTS

2
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:31,866
Where's our limo?

3
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,200
It's a truck!

4
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,453
Oh, we deserve better!

5
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:39,248
Is there a festival on tonight?

6
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:43,210
- A festival?
- Yes, the big one at Suwa Shrine.

7
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,920
That's in Sakagi.

8
00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:48,007
That bus will get you there
in 40 minutes.

9
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:54,263
By bus?
How much is the fare?

10
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,391
It's about 80 yen.

11
00:00:58,476 --> 00:00:59,977
80 yen...

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,897
How far is it on foot?

13
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:06,358
Two miles over the ridge...
The bus is leaving!

14
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,614
Hey, wait for me!

15
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,824
Climb aboard!

16
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,246
Is it 80 yen to Sakagi?

17
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:23,417
I have a proposal.

18
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,628
Can I pay later?

19
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,130
I ran out of cash getting here.

20
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,549
If it's OK, I can pay tomorrow.

21
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,135
I don't think so, sir...

22
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,265
I'm Shintaro Funaki, a sophomore at
Jonan University majoring in Economics.

23
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:43,312
I promise to bring the money
to your depot. Take my student ID.

24
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,648
No way! Forget it!

25
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,567
Buses and public baths
never take credit.

26
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:58,369
- Sorry.
- It's OK, I'll walk.

27
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,330
Sorry to trouble you!

28
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:11,549
THE WIND-OF-YOUTH GROUP

SHIN MORIKAWA,
ARIHIRO FUJIMURA

35
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:54,967
<i>In the town of Soma,
Winds blow over the bushes</i>

36
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:05,436
<i>On the wind-blown bushes
Is a pretty flower</i>

37
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:18,115
<i>My hometown of Soma

DIRECTED BY SEIJUN SUZUKI

00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:27,124
<i>Tie horses in a line
So we won't separate...</i>

40
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,227
That's Mom and Dad up at the front.

41
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:48,812
And Mr. Murakawa, the trumpeter.

42
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:52,566
Next to him is my sister Misako
and Motchan.

43
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:55,319
And next to them is...

44
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,530
Oh? What's wrong?

45
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,742
I can't tell one from the other.

46
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,204
I bet!

47
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:09,416
- I'm Megumi. Nice meeting you.
- Same here.

48
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,253
I wish I traveled all year round
like you.

49
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:15,089
- You like traveling?
- Oh, yes.

50
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:18,259
I went to Hokkaido.
Next up is Kyushu.

51
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:22,888
I'll cover Japan while I'm a student,
then I'll go to America.

52
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,974
I'll sell Japanese products.

53
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,350
That's great!

54
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,186
You aim high!

55
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,690
I wish I were like you.

56
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,199
That was a dusty ride!

57
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,413
Stop right there!

58
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,081
Stop!

59
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,672
I'm Akita, the promoter.
Who's Kinyo Imai?

60
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:02,219
I am, sir.
Thanks for meeting us out here.

61
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:06,056
- Who does the striptease?
- Let me show you.

62
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,100
That girl there.

63
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,227
Just the one?

64
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:12,146
What about her?

65
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:16,025
That's my daughter.
She does magic.

66
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,278
Girlie, come here.

67
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,950
No trouble.

68
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:27,244
Let's see what you've got.

69
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,662
Akemi...

70
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:39,340
You have great legs.
And tits too!

71
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,343
Do you strip right down?

72
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:44,136
If I feel like it.

73
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:47,431
Good!

74
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,142
Goodbye, sir.

75
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,443
Make sure she feels like it.

76
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:08,952
Who's that jerk?

77
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,872
Let's swerve this town, Boss.

78
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,584
We'll stay. It's only for a night.

79
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,796
Kurita, we're on.
Put the banner up.

80
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,840
Akemi, sit here.

81
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,634
KINYO IMAI TRAVELING
MAGIC SHOW

82
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,678
This is a magic troupe
but she's the star.

83
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,399
Feast your eyes on this!

84
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,071
This lock will keep your home safe.

85
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,115
With guaranteed durability.

86
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,951
A hit from a hammer won't scratch it.

87
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:52,246
It's yours for just 200 yen.

88
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:56,500
Excuse me.
Is this spot taken?

89
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,963
- What's it look like?
- Thank you.

90
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:13,809
What are you up to, young fella?

91
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,438
I'm working.

92
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:18,939
Working?

93
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:22,943
You know what a vendor's space is?

94
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,278
No. What's that?

95
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,697
You don't know?

96
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:30,200
You need permission
to sell things here.

97
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,619
I just asked you.

98
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:36,206
That won't do.
You really are clueless.

99
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,835
Monopolizing trade is illegal!

100
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,131
Listen, kid.
You're pissing me off.

101
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:48,218
Wait. All I ate today was
a boxed lunch on the train.

102
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,721
Hunger irritates people.

103
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:53,390
- That's enough.
- Stop, you idiot!

104
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,979
We outsiders can't afford
to get into brawls.

105
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,398
He commandeered this space.

106
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,610
I didn't. I don't know
what he's talking about.

107
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,905
You're a student?
Move it.

108
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,115
What's your story?

109
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,159
I worked to fund my trip,

110
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:16,788
but my boss went bankrupt
and paid me in merchandise.

111
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,666
Young men today are pragmatic!

112
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,336
Is that right?
I just like traveling.

113
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,879
I see.

114
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:30,010
We're the Senba Yakuza family
and we go round all the festivals.

115
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,679
Why don't you tag along?

116
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,308
That sounds great!
My name is Shintaro Funaki.

117
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,185
I'm Jeep Aoki.

118
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,562
He's Full Moon Sanpei.

119
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,524
For my fully rounded personality.

120
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,401
What are you selling?

121
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,823
These.

122
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:53,492
These won't sell.

123
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,786
Oh, no!

124
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,122
There you are!

125
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,666
Akemi!

126
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:04,545
Will you marry me
if I left my wife?

127
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,264
Come on, Akemi!
Take them off!

128
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,599
Hush! I was just about to.

129
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,941
- I'll have a go.
- Out of my way!

130
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,862
Where's the light?

131
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,615
Oh, what a surprise!

132
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,951
That was something.

133
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,663
The wiggling and the wobbling
and the shaking.

134
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,207
That vamp made me dizzy.

135
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:46,336
If she got you dizzy,
the next act will kill you!

136
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,964
Yeah? What's the next act?

137
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,174
For the first time in Sakagi,

138
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,387
we have the great magicians,
Kinyo and Kinka.

139
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,472
Let the magic begin!

140
00:09:57,598 --> 00:10:00,017
Let's hear it for them, folks!

141
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,817
- Off the stage, Pop!
- Old lady, take off your clothes!

142
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,537
This is dumb!
Give us the striptease!

143
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:24,875
- OK, I'll do something exciting.
- Don't bother!

144
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,426
I'm not here for a magic show!

145
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,430
Akemi!

146
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,072
Strip, please!

147
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,034
Here, have an eye full!

148
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:01,995
Akemi!

149
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:23,934
Hey, sis.

150
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,397
- What's wrong?
- Get ready.

151
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:32,067
I saw that student
hawking at the festival.

152
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,736
- What was he selling?
- Well...

153
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:39,616
It's something too shocking
for a lady to say.

154
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,619
Like some, ladies?

155
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,246
No!

156
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:51,878
- He has some nerve.
- Just looking at 'em makes me blush.

157
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,005
Take a look.

158
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,135
Hi, there!

159
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,597
Young man, do me a favor.

160
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:05,475
Certainly. You're my first customer.

161
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,437
I'll give you a special deal.

162
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:13,108
That's not it.
I'm traveling but I'm short for cash.

163
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,987
You look new at this.

164
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:21,658
You're wasting a good space.
I'll be your hawker.

165
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,746
- And do what?
- I'll show how it's done.

166
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:28,290
Step aside and watch.

167
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,085
You've got nothing to lose.

168
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:37,758
Step up, one and all!
Slip 'em on!

169
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:42,012
Bras and undies!
They're not old undies.

170
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:45,724
Nylon undies
from a Tokyo fashion house.

171
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,893
Of the best quality!

172
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,065
Gentlemen.

173
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:58,487
Ken-san. Let's drink
to celebrate our new friendship.

174
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,823
Thank you, but I have business.

175
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,242
Please, excuse me tonight.

176
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,162
That's a shame.

177
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,165
Young man, I have to go.

178
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,793
What's the mark-up?

179
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,712
- Mark-up?
- What's the cost price?

180
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:19,758
I don't know.
My boss just paid me off in panties.

181
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:25,347
<i>I see.
How about quatro-seis?</i>

182
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,600
What's that?

183
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:32,020
It means 4 to 6.
You get 6 out of 10.

184
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,730
OK, that's good.

185
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,106
Here.

186
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,152
Young man, sorry I bothered you.

187
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:47,285
Farewell, brothers of the Senba family.

188
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,877
He's all business.

189
00:13:56,002 --> 00:14:00,215
- I haven't seen him around.
- I bet he's experienced.

190
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,842
Is he in the same trade?

191
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:06,346
He's an empty-handed Yakuza.
He's on the road and broke.

192
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:10,976
They hawk for other Yakuza
for a percentage.

193
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,812
He goes around empty-handed.

194
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,022
That's funny.

195
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:19,776
- He's tracking someone down.
- I bet.

196
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,780
Mister!

197
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:26,950
Do you know him?

198
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:30,328
He gave me a ride on their truck.

199
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,247
Now I can pay him.

200
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,583
I like that, Student!

201
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,795
You're more dignified
than most young men today.

202
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,339
I have a candle here.

203
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:45,802
<i>With a presto,
I'll turn it into a bouquet. Behold!</i>

204
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,725
- Whoops...
- You're too hasty.

205
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,603
Hold this hole down like this.

206
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,606
I know that.
Let me try again.

207
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:01,776
Magic is 50% skill. Right, Dad?

208
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:05,447
Otherwise I'd be out of business.

209
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,741
- It's ready.
- Thanks.

210
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,536
Hercules, it's payday.

211
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,710
- Here.
- Thanks, Boss.

212
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,087
Has Akemi gone out?

213
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:25,550
- Mr. Akita took her for a drive.
- A drive?

214
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,636
She's so laid-back.

215
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:31,598
Why is she staying up
when she has a show tomorrow?

216
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:35,226
Her act is always lousy
after a night out.

217
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,395
Talk to her, everybody.

218
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,901
Mura, didn't you know about Akemi?

219
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,487
I knew we shouldn't have come here.

220
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:51,326
I don't like the look
of that man, Akita.

221
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:58,249
But you know Akemi.

222
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,170
She flirts with any rich looking guy.

223
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:05,215
Take that back!
Akemi doesn't flirt!

224
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,885
When did you see her flirt?

225
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,679
Break it up!

226
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,389
Stop, Hercules!

227
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,976
Mura, run!

228
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,560
Stop it!

229
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,605
Please don't!

230
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,403
Let me down!

231
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,789
- What a dumb muscleman!
- Who called me dumb?

232
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,542
Who said that?

233
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,881
He said you were all muscle.

234
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:50,802
I heard what he said.
I challenge you!

235
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:55,682
Hercules, the student
didn't mean anything.

236
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:59,436
- I won't let him off.
- I accept you challenge.

237
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,563
Come outside!

238
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,523
Let's do it here.

239
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,568
But I'll decide how we settle this.

240
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,155
In a duel,
the challenged chooses the weapon.

241
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,659
Good! Judo, sumo, karate...
Just name it!

242
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:18,830
No good, I can't do any of them.
How about this?

243
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,082
- What's that?
- Thumb wrestling.

244
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,877
- You joker!
- Hold it!

245
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:28,006
I thought I could choose.
Unless you're no good at it...

246
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:30,008
Nonsense! Come on!

247
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,094
We do this sitting.

248
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,939
- He got away!
- Come on!

249
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,074
OK, Mary Akemi.

250
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,870
- Are you in on the plan?
- Sure thing.

251
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,707
- Long as you pay up.
- I'll do as I said.

252
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,293
Mr. Akita,
you've been gone a while.

253
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,836
Business!

254
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,215
Hey, Sabu.

255
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:18,139
- Get me ten thugs right away.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,065
He won!

257
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:31,569
Having a good time?

258
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:35,031
- Evening, sir.
- Akemi's back!

259
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:38,701
Thanks for putting us up
in this nice inn.

260
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,621
We usually sleep backstage.

261
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,332
I'm pleased you're happy.

262
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,459
Can I have a word?

263
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,419
- With me, sir?
- Yes.

264
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:09,357
Listen, Kinyo.
It's about Akemi.

265
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,778
She was confiding in me tonight.

266
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:17,323
It sounds like she's had it
with your act.

267
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,117
What do you mean?

268
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:22,537
- That's horseshit!
- Stay out of this!

269
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:29,544
Akemi's tired of going
from one venue to the next.

270
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,006
She'll have to leave your company.

271
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:36,217
- Is that true?
- Something like that.

272
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,180
You could've told me sooner, Akemi.

273
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:43,725
You can't walk out
on such short notice.

274
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,521
Can't you just finish the shows
we've booked?

275
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,649
Yes, that sounds fair.

276
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:57,405
Why are you quitting?
Is some guy behind this?

277
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,490
Ms. Mary Akemi signed

278
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,952
an exclusive contract
with Akita Promotions.

279
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,876
She'll perform at my shows
and at bigger venues. She'll be a star!

280
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,840
You should be happy
that she got a break.

281
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,219
Mr. Akita, don't mess around.

282
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:23,598
- You're being so irrational.
- He's right!

283
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:27,060
I wouldn't act tough if I were you.

284
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,562
Come up here!

285
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,527
Get your ass out of here!

286
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,864
Let him go!

287
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:46,454
Didn't I warn you not to do that?

288
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,539
Put her down!

289
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,252
Go.

290
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,093
- Don't you have a contract?
- No, we don't.

291
00:21:00,218 --> 00:21:02,178
Call me old-fashioned,

292
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:06,349
but verbal agreements mean more
than a piece of paper.

293
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,394
Then there's nothing you can do.

294
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:11,854
- There isn't?
- No.

295
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,900
If she's not legally bound,
she's free to go.

296
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:20,530
But he deserves a slap
for the trouble he's caused.

297
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,031
What's that?

298
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,492
You bitch...

299
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,452
You can hit me.

300
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,507
What's going on?

301
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:43,052
- He shot me!
- Don't be so rough, Student!

302
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:47,890
You joker!

303
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:10,288
- Then what?
- I slept in the stable.

304
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,832
Do horses sleep quietly?

305
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:16,753
I'd say they're probably
quieter than you.

306
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,255
Oh, you don't know me!

307
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,425
- I can tell.
- You can't.

308
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,028
I can barely pay my tuition
but I travel,

309
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:45,114
so I should put up with the stables.

310
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:52,580
- Want one?
- Thank you.

311
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:57,335
Living rough makes life interesting.

312
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,505
You meet people
and have encounters.

313
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,510
I envy students.
You're optimistic and easy-going.

314
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,055
- You think so?
- Yes.

315
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,934
There's more to it.
I am naturally easy-going.

316
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,187
But I know that pessimism
gets me nowhere.

317
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,774
There's enough trouble in the world.

318
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,944
I'd rather be carefree than worried.

319
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,781
- We don't have that luxury.
- Why not?

320
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,618
We always walk in the shade.

321
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,578
That's an old wives' tale.

322
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:35,998
If you don't like the shade,
walk in the sun.

323
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,794
- It's just how you see it.
- You're right.

324
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:45,383
But living with Dad can be bleak.

325
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,802
We don't even have a home.

326
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:05,069
I want to go to Tokyo
and work in an office.

327
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,449
I want to live like a regular girl.

328
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:25,882
<i>After all
I'm just like maiden grass</i>

329
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:31,471
<i>Wilting sadly by the stream</i>

330
00:24:34,015 --> 00:24:41,481
<i>And just like me
You're maiden grass</i>

331
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:46,903
<i>Wilting sadly by the stream</i>

332
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:52,992
<i>We know very well</i>

333
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:57,038
<i>What our future holds</i>

334
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:02,418
<i>We know our love won't bloom</i>

335
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:12,178
<i>Not in our lifetime</i>

336
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:17,600
<i>For we're lonely
Wilting maiden grass</i>

337
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:29,380
Where would
that magician family be now?

338
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:33,593
They got to me,
especially the girls.

339
00:26:46,272 --> 00:26:48,024
Come on, sis!

340
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,570
And then he goes...

341
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:56,949
...like that!

342
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:04,624
We need a striptease act, dear.

343
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,877
I can go to Tokyo
and find a stripper.

344
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:11,672
- I could be back in five days.
- Don't you worry.

345
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:14,884
We're a magic show act.

346
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:19,055
We have no use for a wild girl
bouncing around.

347
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,059
My magic tricks will attract people.

348
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:25,269
I hope so, dear.

349
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:29,607
You must be joking.
Use your common sense.

350
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:33,361
Audiences these days
want a striptease.

351
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:36,781
- That's how things go.
- Have a drink.

352
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:41,744
- But, sir...
- I'm sorry the girl left you.

353
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,955
But it says striptease
on the marquee.

354
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,625
I can't pay you in full.

355
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:50,670
Kayo, honey.

356
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:55,216
We wouldn't be in business
if it wasn't for your songs.

357
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,469
- I'll do my best.
- Go get 'em.

358
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,764
I'll pay you half.

359
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,809
I said three days
but you have two days.

360
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:09,146
That makes no sense!
We're a magic show act.

361
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:12,900
The striptease was just for variety.

362
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,403
Take it or leave it.

363
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:19,281
People only came to your show
to see Mary Akemi.

364
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:23,828
Magic shows aren't enough.
That's why I got a singer.

365
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:28,624
<i>The wind comes whistling along</i>

366
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:32,461
<i>The tide comes rolling along</i>

367
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:39,927
<i>It's lonely on the beach
With the setting sun</i>

368
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:45,933
<i>If you're all by yourself</i>

369
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:50,938
<i>It's even lonelier</i>

370
00:28:54,191 --> 00:28:57,611
<i>On my hands, harvesting kelp</i>

371
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:01,115
<i>As the tears fall</i>

372
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:08,748
<i>I stretch my back
Look up and see</i>

373
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:14,670
<i>Beyond the faraway sky</i>

374
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,093
Thank you.

375
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,845
Watch your step.

376
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,188
Let's go.

377
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:38,486
- Lady, let me do it.
- How nice of you.

378
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,617
- Here.
- Thank you.

379
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:50,164
KINYO IMAI
TRAVELING MAGIC SHOW

380
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:07,765
Boss, let me tell you a bad joke
that Mura told me.

381
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,059
It was so bad I...

382
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,895
Maybe later.

383
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,652
I can only depend
on Mr. Yamaguchi now.

384
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:24,907
He and I go way back
and he knows us well.

385
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:30,830
He can help us
with his connections.

386
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:37,253
He always said he'd help us
if we had a problem.

387
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:42,967
Kurita, take a letter to him
after the show.

388
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,343
I will.

389
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:47,513
I don't like asking for favors but...

390
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,476
I think I'm getting old.

391
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,487
Ken-san, is that you?

392
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,032
Hey, Shintaro!

393
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:08,701
Oh, hello.

394
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:12,705
- Dad, Shintaro is here.
- Hi!

395
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,001
- How's business?
- Not bad.

396
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,878
Good for you.

397
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,255
- Here.
- Thank you.

398
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,174
It's a gift.

399
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,890
Dad, open it.

400
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:37,980
- Anything wrong?
- Keep out of it.

401
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:41,817
Business is bad.
I'll open your gift.

402
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,945
People don't go to magic acts.

403
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,114
Kurita, pour some tea.

404
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:52,244
It's time to pull out
and start a new business.

405
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,330
Don't be silly!

406
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,710
Dad, you know
Mr. Katsumata was right.

407
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,714
Fool! You're a fool!

408
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,346
He's the only fool.

409
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:13,349
Let him keep his dignity.

410
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:16,977
Please leave.
It's nothing to do with you.

411
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,730
We need an outside opinion.

412
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,900
Otherwise, we'll go on living
from hand to mouth.

413
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:24,360
Excuse me.

414
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:27,196
Shintaro, I want to hear
what you think.

415
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,784
I admire the courageous way you live.

416
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:35,120
I wish you could find a way
to continue.

417
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,768
Dear...

418
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:10,864
Do you know a man
with a scar on his face?

419
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:13,117
I do!

420
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:20,249
He asked us
about Kurita and his tattoo.

421
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:22,835
The falcon tattoo on his shoulder.

422
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:39,893
How about a lock for 200 yen?
Only 200 yen!

423
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:43,272
This lock won a special national prize!

424
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,858
Far better than first or second place.

425
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:49,319
- Hey, Ken-san!
- Why don't you take a break?

426
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,115
OK, it's your turn.

427
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:59,872
So you're looking for someone.
Is it a gal?

428
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:02,249
Or somebody you want to kill?

429
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:06,211
Do I look like that type of guy?

430
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:09,465
I just enjoy traveling, same as you.

431
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:16,889
Can I have your attention ladies,
young, old, tall or short?

432
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,101
Student!

433
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:25,689
Meet me behind the shrine
tonight at ten.

434
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:30,402
- What for?
- I'll teach you to stay away.

435
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:33,822
You can bring company if you want.
Be sure to come!

436
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,342
I don't know what you mean...

437
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,676
Hey!

438
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:04,061
This must be a mistake.

439
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:06,688
I have no money on me.

440
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:09,942
Don't worry, I'm no thief.

441
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:15,072
Just keep walking
and don't make a scene.

442
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:21,120
I'm delivering an important letter
from my boss.

443
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:26,750
Can't you wait until I've delivered it?

444
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,378
Our company's future depends on it.

445
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,046
Keep walking.

446
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,849
Stop.

447
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,186
Show me the tattoo, Gen.

448
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,814
Who are you?

449
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:52,776
I'm Ken.
I'm affiliated with the Ezaki family.

450
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,362
I knew it!

451
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,074
I knew someone would
come for me someday.

452
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,912
Listen, Ken-san.

453
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:07,541
It's true,
I did run away from the Yakuza.

454
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:11,461
But I didn't go blabbing
to the police.

455
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:16,842
I'd just had enough of drug dealing.

456
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,469
Do you still have to kill me?

457
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,388
Looks that way.

458
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,433
- That's what the deal is.
- All right.

459
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:29,521
- Then so be it.
- Now walk straight.

460
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:34,735
Turn around when I say.
That'll be the end for you.

461
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,865
Ken-san. Do me a favor.

462
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,537
Deliver this letter for me.

463
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:49,499
You're awfully loyal
to that no-good company.

464
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:53,837
We traveled, ate and slept together.

465
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:58,675
They're more important
than family to me.

466
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,637
- You wouldn't understand.
- No.

467
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,847
I don't want to.

468
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,474
Please...

469
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:23,700
Come on!

470
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,328
Stop tormenting me!

471
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:30,582
Come on!

472
00:37:43,553 --> 00:37:46,265
Is that your gun?

473
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,891
Sorry about that.

474
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:51,144
But you lied to me.
I'd say we're even now.

475
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,526
Mr. Kurita!

476
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:59,486
Move it!

477
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,863
Go and do what you have to do.

478
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,866
Thank you.

479
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,620
I owe you one, Student!

480
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,752
What am I supposed to do now?

481
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,588
We've had enough trouble.

482
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:23,719
You wouldn't shoot me for no reason.

483
00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:25,762
You're not a mad dog.

484
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:31,268
Maybe I am a mad dog.

485
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:43,155
You get on my nerves.
Out of my sight now!

486
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,824
- Not yet.
- Why not?

487
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,659
I need to ask you a favor.

488
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,287
That's enough fooling around.

489
00:38:50,412 --> 00:38:56,084
I'm in trouble. A tough guy from
the magic company wants to fight me.

490
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,504
I'd rather not get involved
in some dumb fight.

491
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:05,677
I figure it's best
to get it over and done with.

492
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:09,639
I want you to be the mediator.

493
00:39:09,765 --> 00:39:11,933
I don't want anybody hurt.

494
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:16,271
You're alright, kid.

495
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:30,494
You're late!
I see you've got a sidekick.

496
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:34,498
Don't get me wrong.
He's just an observer.

497
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:38,335
Why don't we talk before we fight?

498
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,545
This is ridiculous.

499
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,131
I'm not here to talk!

500
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,344
He doesn't want to talk.

501
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,147
Mr. Mochizuki!

502
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,608
Are you OK?

503
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,988
Look at you,
there's mud on your face.

504
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:20,979
You're one lucky son of a gun.

505
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:24,983
- You're not so bad yourself.
- Don't flatter me.

506
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:29,821
What about the old clown?
He won't be back.

507
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,199
I'll just find him again.

508
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:36,328
He's trying too hard to go straight.
Leave him be.

509
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:39,581
No way.
Stick to your own business.

510
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:51,885
Lady, step up and take a peek.

511
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,262
Why not strip off and try these?

512
00:41:57,098 --> 00:42:01,144
Stick to your own business
when it's all you have.

513
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:09,903
Come enjoy our magic show!

514
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,157
Thank you for coming, sir.

515
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,062
Mr. Yamaguchi.

516
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,773
It's usually more crowded.

517
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:50,402
It's so hot,
folks don't leave home.

518
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:54,322
In the evening,
we'll get a packed house.

519
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:58,827
Did you say quit?

520
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:02,247
Yes, I think you'd better disband.

521
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:06,960
I came all this way,
but I won't promote this act.

522
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,005
Mr. Yamaguchi, I beg you.

523
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,925
I know it's a risk,
but I want to perform in your theater.

524
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,428
We'll do our special show.

525
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:21,683
I'm not young anymore.
I won't do anything reckless.

526
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:26,438
Mr. Yamaguchi, give us
one last chance, please!

527
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,109
Mr. Kinyo, what would you bet?

528
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:34,654
Bet, sir?

529
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,157
If I promoted your act,

530
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,827
I'd be spending a lot on your show.

531
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,205
I'd be getting that.
What about you?

532
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:48,877
I see.

533
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:52,922
I bet my pride as a showman.

534
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:55,717
If I fail, I'll call it quits.

535
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,178
Your pride isn't worth a penny.

536
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:02,307
Let me ask you, sir.
What should we bet?

537
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:07,562
How about Ms. Misako?

538
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,155
Don't get me wrong,
I don't want her for my concubine.

539
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,032
I want her for my son's wife.

540
00:44:19,157 --> 00:44:21,785
But your son's a dim...

541
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:25,246
Yes, he's a dimwit.

542
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,960
He's a little simple
after he contracted meningitis.

543
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:37,342
Folks, presenting
the strongest man in Japan.

544
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:38,927
George, psst!

545
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,053
George!

546
00:44:41,054 --> 00:44:43,640
He's Hercules Sano!

547
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:48,228
With a yell,
he will break this thick chain!

548
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,480
Witness his power.

549
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:54,567
Of course, I'll make sure
Misako is taken care of.

550
00:44:54,693 --> 00:44:59,114
And I'll take care
of your magic show from now on.

551
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,867
I have to say no.

552
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,370
I'm Kinyo Imai, the magician.

553
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:07,956
I can't sell my daughter for a job.

554
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:11,501
You're not selling her. It's a bet.

555
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:14,963
If the show's successful,
the bet is off.

556
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:18,967
Do you lack confidence
in the show?

557
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:20,510
This is no joke!

558
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:24,180
We can't barter Misako for our show.

559
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,141
Right, everyone?

560
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:30,770
Boss, I'd rather perform on the street.

561
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,939
Don't be rude.

562
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,525
Don't assume we'll fail.

563
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,736
People will come!

564
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:40,572
I still have it left in me...

565
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:43,158
- But, my dear...
- What?

566
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,326
You don't have faith in me?

567
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:50,665
What about you, Misako?

568
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,543
You think I'm too old for this?

569
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:54,961
Misako?

570
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,934
Dad...

571
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:12,061
If your show's a success...

572
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:15,273
...let me go to Tokyo.

573
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:23,656
Mr. Yamaguchi...

574
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:25,825
So we're on, are we?

575
00:46:28,036 --> 00:46:33,374
You bet. I'll put on a performance
of a lifetime! You just watch.

576
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,378
You can't gamble
with your future and happiness.

577
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:41,382
This is my only chance
to flee to Tokyo.

578
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,511
I can't let you marry that idiot.

579
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:46,179
What do you suggest?

580
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,265
Shintaro.

581
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:08,576
Sorry.

582
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,913
I'm just a helpless student.

583
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,544
We just have to trust your father.

584
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:27,554
Dad's practicing
his special magic trick.

585
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,889
Come and see his rope escape.

586
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:35,019
Isn't it exciting?

587
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:37,647
Come and cheer for him.

588
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,774
Cheering won't do any good.

589
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,737
I'm ready.

590
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:48,908
Misako, do the countdown.

591
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:51,327
I'll do it.

592
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:58,835
Ten seconds.

593
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,466
Four minutes and 40 seconds.

594
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,680
Four minutes and 50 seconds.

595
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:13,308
Boss, you can do it!

596
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:39,334
Dear...

597
00:48:40,627 --> 00:48:42,879
Honey, I can't do it.

598
00:48:48,301 --> 00:48:49,761
Oh, my dearest!

599
00:48:49,886 --> 00:48:51,262
Dearest!

600
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:55,725
- I can't...
- Dad, don't be so pathetic!

601
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:59,812
Get a grip.
I have faith in you!

602
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:22,919
Thanks for the other day.
I delivered the letter.

603
00:49:23,044 --> 00:49:25,296
- Why did you return?
- To talk to Ken-san.

604
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:28,883
Are you crazy?
Go before he sees you.

605
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:31,928
- I have to talk to him.
- Okay.

606
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,643
Ken-san.

607
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,939
He has something to talk to you about.

608
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,983
To me?

609
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:48,403
You've got a nerve,
you son of a bitch!

610
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,864
Ken-san.

611
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:56,577
I've had enough
of running and hiding.

612
00:49:57,537 --> 00:50:00,623
You can do what you want with me.

613
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:03,251
I won't hide anymore.

614
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,336
On one condition, though.

615
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,339
I have a favor.

616
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,300
What is it?

617
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:15,680
Let me live
until the end of the next show.

618
00:50:16,723 --> 00:50:21,728
The next show will determine
the fate of this company.

619
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:26,482
I want to help them
make the show a success.

620
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:27,942
Ken-san...

621
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:35,575
If you don't trust me,
come and keep an eye on me.

622
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,869
Ken-san, please.

623
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:39,412
I beg of you.

624
00:50:41,122 --> 00:50:42,749
Have mercy on me.

625
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,129
Ready, Boss?

626
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,134
Here I go, Misako.

627
00:50:57,930 --> 00:50:58,931
Five seconds.

628
00:51:03,478 --> 00:51:04,729
Ten seconds.

629
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,984
Fifteen seconds.

630
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,904
Be quiet! He's concentrating.

631
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:14,238
Twenty seconds.

632
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:19,619
One minute and 15 seconds.

633
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:24,457
One minute and 20 seconds.

634
00:51:27,376 --> 00:51:29,045
One minute and 25 seconds.

635
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,509
One minute and 30 seconds.

636
00:51:38,387 --> 00:51:40,264
One minute and 35 seconds.

637
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,934
He did it.

638
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:44,811
One minute and 40 seconds.

639
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:50,024
- One minute and 45 seconds!
- Hurray!

640
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,860
Boss!

641
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:57,365
- Now I'm even!
- That hurt.

642
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,370
I did it!

643
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:05,915
You were great, Dad.

644
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,252
It took too long.
I would've drowned.

645
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,337
Drowned? What do you mean?

646
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:17,301
I'll be bound, cuffed
and locked in a box underwater.

647
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,928
That's dangerous!

648
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:22,723
Don't worry, I'll use a trick box.

649
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:25,226
Once I'm free, I'll come right out.

650
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:26,769
Cuff me.

651
00:52:53,296 --> 00:52:57,758
Just when we've become pals,
we have to say goodbye.

652
00:52:57,884 --> 00:53:03,222
I'd ask you to go with us
if you could, but you're a student!

653
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:06,184
Don't go to university
in your next life.

654
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:09,187
What's next, Student?

655
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:11,647
Thanks to you,
I got rid of the undies.

656
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:14,358
Now I'll explore Japan.

657
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:17,695
If you come across a festival,
look for us.

658
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,823
I will!
You made this trip a lot of fun!

659
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:27,788
Well, thanks to you,
we learned that panties sell well.

660
00:53:27,914 --> 00:53:30,833
I'll toss my locks
and take up panties.

661
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:35,463
We'll be staying at Tatsumi Inn
in Wakamatsu.

662
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:37,590
Let's get moving.

663
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,343
- Off we go. So long!
- Thank you!

664
00:53:40,468 --> 00:53:46,557
<i>Bye-bye isn't a bad thing
But it's kind of sad</i>

665
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:53,814
<i>We hold back our tears
Until we meet again, that's right!</i>

666
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,912
Good morning!

667
00:54:08,037 --> 00:54:10,957
Mr. Kinyo and the gang
went to the dam.

668
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,586
With my vital capacity,
I'll last two minutes.

669
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:19,382
I'm sure I can get out
in one minute or so.

670
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:22,176
But wait until one minute
and 40 seconds.

671
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,971
I'll leave it to you.

672
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:26,430
Yes, dear.

673
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,826
This is thrilling and suspenseful.

674
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,544
Will Dad be OK?

675
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:58,713
It's a piece of cake for him.

676
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:00,589
I got you!

677
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,513
Come one, come all!

678
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:12,476
Kinyo Imai performs
the greatest show of his life!

679
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:15,730
Get ready to give him a big hand!

680
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,380
One minute and 25 seconds.

681
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:46,594
There are no bubbles
coming to the surface.

682
00:55:47,928 --> 00:55:51,390
Can you feel any movement
on the rope?

683
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:55,770
One minute and 30 seconds.

684
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,069
Pull it up.

685
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,284
Leave it there.

686
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:15,956
One minute and 38, 39 seconds...

687
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:18,167
Forty.

688
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:20,544
Forty-one.

689
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:23,130
Forty-two.

690
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:29,553
Ma'am.

691
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:32,556
I know what he can take.
Wait till two minutes.

692
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:43,150
Do it! Pull it up!

693
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:50,199
Quickly!

694
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:25,192
- We'll have to quit.
- I guess that's the only choice.

695
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:28,863
Don't give up!
You know I'm not smart.

696
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:31,615
I'll never make it on my own.

697
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:36,871
It won't be easy for me either.

698
00:57:36,996 --> 00:57:39,206
There's no other option.

699
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:41,834
What can we do?

700
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:46,505
The show was built
around the boss' magic act.

701
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,137
What a happy way to go.

702
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,434
You died mid-performance.

703
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:02,688
That's the best way for a performer.

704
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,827
I want to put on a show.

705
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,623
We can't just call it quits.

706
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:07,378
It's my chance to go to Tokyo.

707
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:12,341
But I want the show to go on
for the troupe.

708
00:59:13,926 --> 00:59:18,305
If Mr. Yamaguchi agrees,
I can pull it off.

709
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:25,312
But the audience won't be satisfied
with old tricks.

710
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:28,232
It takes time to master new tricks.

711
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,945
Do you have any good ideas?

712
00:59:33,696 --> 00:59:36,365
You can make it into a revue.

713
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,117
A revue?

714
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:43,038
Your father's rope escape
would've been a great attraction.

715
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:45,416
That's the way to do it.

716
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:48,586
Mr. Kurita.

717
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:55,968
Mr. Yamaguchi is pulling out on us.

718
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,511
He can't!

719
00:59:59,722 --> 01:00:04,351
He thinks it's gone too far.
He wants out.

720
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:11,108
If you want this,
you should go and talk to him.

721
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:17,406
YAMAGUCHI

722
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:20,200
I don't think people
are bored with magic.

723
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:23,454
It's just how it's presented.

724
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:27,124
Audiences get bored
with how the show unfolds.

725
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:28,459
She's right.

726
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:33,380
The tricks shouldn't be in a sequence
but integrated into a revue.

727
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:35,341
A revue?

728
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:40,054
The magic acts will be part
of an exciting show.

729
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:44,266
But you have no star attraction.

730
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:48,145
You can't attract people with your name.

731
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:51,190
I think I'll have to cancel.

732
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:55,944
All companies start
without stars and name value.

733
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,530
Give us two days, or just one day.

734
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:00,282
Give us a chance.

735
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:05,371
And our bet is still on.

736
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:10,125
I can't lose this bet.
It seems unfair.

737
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,127
Let's not do this.

738
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:19,176
Let me talk to some magicians
about your mother and the troupe.

739
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:24,473
Mr. Yamaguchi, this is not
my father's bet. It's mine.

740
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,602
Have you seen my son?

741
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:54,503
This is Ryosuke.
Say hello.

742
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:03,762
Misako.

743
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,976
Are you still on?

744
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:13,856
Yes.

745
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:23,115
- Mura?
- Can't you find Mura?

746
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,534
He's nowhere!

747
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:27,995
Well, go without him.

748
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,789
- So long!
- Take care.

749
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:34,126
I haven't seen Mura since last night.

750
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,128
Did he split?

751
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,797
Imagine leaving us at a time like this!

752
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:41,008
Let him go!

753
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:43,886
Let the coward be gone!

754
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:46,054
Off we go, start the truck!

755
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,808
I'll be at Star Theater!

756
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:31,099
I hold the deck like this
and the lady taps it.

757
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:35,854
The card you selected will remain!

758
01:03:35,979 --> 01:03:39,900
If it works,
let's hear some applause!

759
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:42,861
- Is this the card?
- Come on, Motchan!

760
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:47,574
Fail with style!
Don't ruin your gag!

761
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:51,119
Oh, can't I get it right sometimes?

762
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:54,998
Six, 2, 3, 4!
Seven, 2, 3, 4!

763
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:09,847
Misako, this is a striptease number,
you know?

764
01:04:09,972 --> 01:04:13,934
Yes, and I'm doing it.
Anything for the show.

765
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:20,691
I find the way
they apply themselves wonderful.

766
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:25,279
Performers are looked down on,
but they have such dignity.

767
01:04:25,404 --> 01:04:27,781
Not everyone can do this.

768
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:29,241
Exactly.

769
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:34,037
Who'd dedicate themselves
to something so silly?

770
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:37,165
You say that,
but you come to see it every day.

771
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,835
I'm just keeping my eye
on the clown.

772
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,337
You never know what he's up to.

773
01:04:44,298 --> 01:04:47,926
He calls himself a clown
but he can't get it right.

774
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:52,472
He doesn't know how to move.

775
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:56,059
Can you put this up?
It's a revue...

776
01:04:56,184 --> 01:05:00,480
Our clientele wouldn't appreciate this.

777
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:04,067
OK, I'll have a coffee.

778
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:06,361
Now I'm the clientele.

779
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,196
Give him a coffee.

780
01:05:09,615 --> 01:05:11,325
Now can we talk?

781
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,827
2 X COFFEE

782
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:16,580
7 X COFFEE

783
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:26,131
CAFÉ

784
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:50,447
We're the Shurei Imai Traveling Revue.

785
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:53,492
We have a new show for your fans.

786
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:56,328
New entertainment
for you lovely folks!

787
01:05:57,454 --> 01:06:01,875
He sucks.
He's chasing people away!

788
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,711
- Maybe you can help.
- What baloney!

789
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:07,589
- I will, then.
- What, you?

790
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:11,593
I should be OK.
I learned from the best.

791
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,428
Correct me.

792
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:21,311
Attention, fair local ladies,
young and old!

793
01:06:21,436 --> 01:06:25,899
Intelligent gents,
kids, pops and grandpas!

794
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:30,070
Come see the one and only
Shurei Imai Revue

795
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:32,280
and its brand new show!

796
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:36,660
It made a Bolshoi Circus
illusionist faint!

797
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:41,248
You'll read that in the papers soon.

798
01:06:41,373 --> 01:06:42,416
That's right!

799
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,960
Kick back and try 'em on!

800
01:06:45,085 --> 01:06:47,921
Have a ball with the Shurei Imai Revue!

801
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,339
That's good!

802
01:06:53,969 --> 01:06:56,638
Welcome to our show,
ladies and gents.

803
01:06:56,763 --> 01:07:00,183
Let me present myself.
I'm a handsome bachelor...

804
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:02,644
- Daddy!
- Don't give me away!

805
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:05,272
Let me present
my beautiful daughter.

806
01:07:05,397 --> 01:07:07,441
Good morning, darling.

807
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:11,737
I feel cold under my nose...

808
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:13,113
Oh, no!

809
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,951
I have here a deck of cards.

810
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:22,164
Just like what you have at home,
no tricks.

811
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:24,332
Pick a card, please.

812
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:30,130
Sir.

813
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,632
We have group discounts.

814
01:07:32,758 --> 01:07:34,384
Shut up!

815
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:39,097
I'm not here for your silly show.
Give me Akemi and Mura!

816
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,099
They quit, sir.

817
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:44,102
Don't lie to me.

818
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:46,772
Mura took Akemi from me.

819
01:07:46,897 --> 01:07:48,607
Give her back!

820
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:51,526
Or else I'll make a scene on stage.

821
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:53,987
Where's your ticket?

822
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,156
Don't play dumb! I'm Akita!

823
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:59,242
If you insist, I'll call the police.

824
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:02,204
I'm not scared of cops.
Come on!

825
01:08:11,046 --> 01:08:12,672
How much?

826
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:14,800
To the box office, please.

827
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:20,639
To the end of the line, please.

828
01:08:20,764 --> 01:08:24,976
Don't make a fuss
when you can't find Akemi.

829
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:26,728
Shut up!

830
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:32,234
- What do we do?
- Beats me.

831
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,340
I thought Akemi could be useful.

832
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:40,969
Even dead trees on a mountain
look cheerful.

833
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:44,014
Are you saying I'm a dead tree?

834
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,644
How did you do that?

835
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:52,981
It wasn't easy with that Akita.

836
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:55,859
I forced my way in to get Akemi.

837
01:09:55,984 --> 01:09:58,778
Akita's men caught up with us.

838
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,283
- I was a little rough...
- That's not good.

839
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:08,288
Then the police probably won't help us.

840
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:11,291
Should we get Mr. Yamaguchi's help?

841
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:14,419
We don't want him involved.

842
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,213
And Ken-san?

843
01:10:16,338 --> 01:10:17,881
He won't help.

844
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:25,472
Megumi, go to the Tatsumi Inn.

845
01:10:25,597 --> 01:10:27,974
Ask the Senba family for their help.

846
01:10:41,238 --> 01:10:42,489
Men!

847
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:44,032
Get her!

848
01:11:01,258 --> 01:11:03,426
I'll keep Akita busy.

849
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:05,470
Who's in charge?

850
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,973
Student!

851
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:10,809
Stop, Student!

852
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,147
Where did you hide, Akemi?

853
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,152
I'll sue you for breach of contract!

854
01:11:28,451 --> 01:11:30,203
Sabu! Takao!

855
01:11:53,935 --> 01:11:57,856
How long do I have to wait?
I have a short fuse!

856
01:11:57,981 --> 01:12:02,569
When the show ends, you can talk
to Mura, Akemi and the boss.

857
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:07,949
He's just buying time.
Let's crash the show.

858
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,701
You're right.

859
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,202
Let's go.

860
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:14,581
Hold on one more second.

861
01:12:14,706 --> 01:12:16,750
Don't touch Mr. Akita!

862
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:20,420
You started this!

863
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:39,314
What's the racket?

864
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:43,693
Ken-san!

865
01:12:57,499 --> 01:12:58,750
Your attention.

866
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:02,837
A girl will shoot
out of the cannon instead of a ball.

867
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:06,424
Will she come out alive?

868
01:13:17,352 --> 01:13:18,436
Fire!

869
01:13:27,195 --> 01:13:30,615
Dad, can you hear the applause?

870
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:38,123
Aren't you coming?
Then I'm gone.

871
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:39,290
Bastard!

872
01:13:56,683 --> 01:13:58,393
Out of my way!

873
01:13:58,518 --> 01:13:59,686
Move!

874
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:08,236
Sorry, fella, we have business
to take care of.

875
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:10,780
We're the invincible Senba family!

876
01:15:50,463 --> 01:15:54,551
<i>If I let you walk away</i>

877
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:59,305
<i>All that'll be left is
A memory of you</i>

878
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:03,977
<i>Who wants to live
Just with memories?</i>

879
01:16:04,435 --> 01:16:08,815
<i>You're the one I set my mind on</i>

880
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:13,987
<i>I'll never let anyone</i>

881
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:22,787
<i>Never let anyone
Have my baby</i>

882
01:16:28,835 --> 01:16:33,172
<i>Even the stars
Fall in love tonight</i>

883
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:39,470
This wouldn't have been possible
without you.

884
01:16:39,596 --> 01:16:42,682
Thank you, sirs. I'm so happy.

885
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,810
Ma'am, we should be thanking you.

886
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:49,105
We kicked butt so good,
we feel like kings!

887
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,857
Come inside.

888
01:16:50,982 --> 01:16:53,776
Wonderful! This is magnificent!

889
01:16:54,652 --> 01:16:56,279
What a success!

890
01:16:56,404 --> 01:16:58,656
Are you saying we won?

891
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:02,368
Oh, yes, I completely lost.

892
01:17:02,493 --> 01:17:07,165
I have an offer.
How about a half-year contract?

893
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:10,001
I want your show
to tour all my theaters.

894
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:13,880
Ten days here,
then half a month in Sendai.

895
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:16,299
And I'll raise your salaries.

896
01:17:19,719 --> 01:17:21,471
I'll buy you a missus.

897
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:24,349
We can finally have a baby.

898
01:17:24,474 --> 01:17:27,518
I can get that new designer suit.

899
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:37,570
What do you say?

900
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:40,281
Thank you, sir.

901
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:43,826
Father would have been so happy.
I'll accept the offer.

902
01:17:46,496 --> 01:17:49,957
Don't you want to go to Tokyo?

903
01:17:50,083 --> 01:17:51,584
Forget it, Mother.

904
01:17:55,546 --> 01:17:58,675
Let's drink to us, Misako.
Hold your drinks up!

905
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:00,176
Cheers!

906
01:18:12,063 --> 01:18:14,607
Old man, are you ready now?

907
01:18:14,732 --> 01:18:18,069
Yes, I have no regrets now.

908
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:22,865
I was able to perform
to a packed house.

909
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:24,534
I appreciate it.

910
01:18:26,244 --> 01:18:27,578
Ken-san?

911
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:31,457
Oh, give it up, mad dog.

912
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,044
I told you to mind
your own business.

913
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:37,130
So you want to do it?

914
01:18:37,255 --> 01:18:40,883
Come on, it's not that I want to.

915
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:43,803
But if I don't shoot him,
I'll lose face.

916
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:46,222
Just empty it then.

917
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:50,810
The problem is,
I've never missed my target.

918
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:52,812
I see.

919
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:54,689
Right, then.

920
01:18:54,814 --> 01:18:56,190
Shoot.

921
01:18:57,734 --> 01:18:59,902
Come on.

922
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:01,696
Go ahead and shoot.

923
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:06,492
Don't rush me, you're annoying me.

924
01:19:06,617 --> 01:19:11,038
Sorry. I'll turn around
and have a smoke.

925
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:34,187
Does shooting off a round satisfy you?

926
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:39,734
You put in blanks!
When did you do that?

927
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:41,319
Last night.

928
01:19:41,444 --> 01:19:43,529
I had a foreboding hunch.

929
01:19:44,489 --> 01:19:46,282
Some joker you are!

930
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:50,495
If I heard you right,
you have no reason to shoot him now.

931
01:19:59,212 --> 01:20:01,047
I'm out!

932
01:20:01,172 --> 01:20:03,633
Have a nice life, old man.

933
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,438
Shintaro!

934
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:19,482
See you later.

935
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:21,025
Okay.

936
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,739
Where have you been?

937
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:28,825
I had a talk with Mr. Kurita.

938
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:33,287
Oh, I was afraid
you'd just go off and leave us.

939
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:36,040
I'll stick around until the run ends.

940
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:58,646
Sorry.
I broke my word.

941
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:05,027
Seeing the troupe, I thought...

942
01:21:07,738 --> 01:21:11,117
I'm a performer's daughter.

943
01:21:11,242 --> 01:21:13,953
You and I live in different worlds.

944
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:22,587
But the time we shared
was the best in my life.

945
01:21:24,672 --> 01:21:28,342
I guess it's the last time
I'll feel like this.

946
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:31,804
We're still young.
We'll meet again one day.

947
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:33,764
You're right.

948
01:21:34,891 --> 01:21:39,061
- I hope so.
- I've never met a gal like you.

949
01:21:39,186 --> 01:21:42,607
The girls at school talk a lot,
but don't do much.

950
01:21:42,732 --> 01:21:46,152
You make much more of your life.

951
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:48,821
- I admire you.
- Thank you.

952
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:52,950
I love how you're so kind.

953
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,514
Walk with me.

954
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:27,652
Listen, don't forget me
when you're back in Tokyo.

955
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:01,143
This is it for me.
I hope you have a successful tour.

956
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,399
Why here?

957
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:09,527
I want to walk and
enjoy the scenery.

958
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:14,532
It'd be harder to say goodbye
at the end of the ridge.

959
01:23:18,661 --> 01:23:19,704
Well, then.

960
01:23:20,663 --> 01:23:22,081
Goodbye.

961
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:28,546
Shintaro! We might see you
when we're touring America!

962
01:23:30,798 --> 01:23:34,427
Go, driver. Step on it!

963
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,309
Goodbye!

964
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:04,915
<i>In the town of Soma
Her hometown of Soma</i>

965
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,926
<i>It's breezy
So I whisper sweet words to my love</i>

966
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:30,149
THE END
