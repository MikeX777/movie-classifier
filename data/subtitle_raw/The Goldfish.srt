1
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,960
- Faster route.
- You are already on the fast...

2
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,760
- Julius.
- Nowotny and his crew are nearly here.

3
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,960
I'm stuck in the holiday traffic.
Is Feldmann there?

4
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,480
- Not yet.
- Tell them I'm nearly there.

5
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,920
- Weren't you stuck in traffic?
- No. I flew in.

6
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,920
I think it's about to start.

7
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,440
We'll chat later.
Step on it. Kiss, kiss.

8
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,560
Yeah, yeah. Right back at you.

9
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,880
MOM

10
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,400
Hey, Mom.
I'm in the car. I can't talk now.

11
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,040
- I was about to text you.
- I wanted to ask when you'll be here.

12
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,400
- I can't make it. I have to work.
- But it's a holiday.

13
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,320
- Not for me.
- Haven't you made enough money yet?

14
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
- Enough for what?
- What?

15
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,760
- Nothing.
- I made you a cheesecake.

16
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,160
I'll try to come by on Sunday.
Think the cake will still be good then?

17
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,600
I said that I made you a cheesecake.

18
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,920
Yes, I got that.
I asked if it'll still be good then.

19
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,720
I lost you for a moment there.

20
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,640
- I have to go now. Keep me some cake.
- Yes, I...

21
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,920
Fuck!

22
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,800
- Hello?
- Was it worth it, Cosima? Was it?

23
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,080
What happened?

24
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,080
There's nail polish
on my glove compartment.

25
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,120
- Look.
- What?

26
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,560
- Was it worth it?
- You woke me up for that? Really?

27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,040
- It won't come out.
- Use nail polish remover.

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,720
No! That will just
rub it all over the place!

29
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,240
- But the car still works, right?
- This isn't funny.

30
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,760
I'll just use nail polish remover...

31
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,440
No! No nail polish remover!

32
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,520
Feldmann will be here in ten.
Shall we start...

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
- No. No way.
- How long do you need?

34
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,440
Ten minutes.

35
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,800
THE GOLDFISH

36
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,040
The doctor said
it's best not to touch you.

37
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,840
He also said, a few vertebrae higher

38
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,480
and you wouldn't be able
to move your arms.

39
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,120
So I guess you were lucky.

40
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,840
Oli, I'm going to Singapore.

41
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,320
With HSBC. They need people there.

42
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,560
You know I've always wanted
to go there.

43
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,080
I feels like there's not much
I can do to help here anyway, right?

44
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,920
I...

45
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,280
Did you say something?

46
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,040
- Turn... back...
- You don't want me to go?

47
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,880
Turn...

48
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,160
off...

49
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,480
the lights.

50
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
Okay.

51
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,400
Take care, Oliver.

52
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,600
THREE MONTHS LATER

53
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,080
Most buses have electric ramps,
or, at least, more and more do.

54
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,640
But not all of them.
There are many different systems.

55
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,560
That's why communicating
with the driver is vital.

56
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,120
That's what we'll practice now.
I'll be the bus driver.

57
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,160
And... Oliver.

58
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,240
You need to indicate whether
you want to get on the bus

59
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,760
or wait for the next one.

60
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,240
- Yep. Okay.
- Okay.

61
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,440
I'm taking the next bus.

62
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,960
OK, in this case, can you pretend
you want to get on this one?

63
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,080
I want to get on.

64
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,960
Think again.

65
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,600
I can't hear you.

66
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,920
The door's shut, it's noisy...

67
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,960
- Cells are ringing...
- Yes, Julius?

68
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,360
Did you reach him?

69
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,120
I'll be online in a sec.

70
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,720
- Oliver...
- Thanks. I'll get a taxi.

71
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,040
No, just talking to a guy here.

72
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,400
Oliver!

73
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,120
I don't understand.
You just had your accident.

74
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,200
I'm fit enough to work, Mr. Feldmann.
Trust me.

75
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,880
You should concentrate
on your new life circumstances.

76
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,760
You should...
How shall I put it? Process it.

77
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
What am I supposed to do?

78
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,080
Sit by the window and look sad?

79
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,320
I can and I want to work.

80
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,720
- If you need anything...
- You've been away for three months.

81
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,000
Kowalczyk is too important to us
to leave you in charge.

82
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,960
Julius will take care
of your other portfolios too.

83
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,320
- Why?
- Your contract ends soon...

84
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,760
Mr. Feldmann?

85
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,760
Hello? Hello, Mr. Feldmann?

86
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,160
Mr. Feldmann? Can you hear me?

87
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,520
- Ms. Cheche, we need to talk.
- No, Oliver, we need to talk.

88
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,800
What are you doing?

89
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,720
The nasal spray needs to sink in.
You left your course again.

90
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,160
- Ms. Cheche...
- Zschetzsche.

91
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,920
- What?
- It's "Zschetzsche".

92
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Zetsche.

93
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,440
- Zschetzsche.
- Zetsche.

94
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,560
- Zschetzsche!
- Ms... The internet here is a disgrace!

95
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,360
- You've got a single room.
- I've got important...

96
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,760
Important, important, important.

97
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,480
Your therapy's important.
Focus on that, not your laptop.

98
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,160
You'll be out in seven weeks.

99
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,000
- Seven weeks without internet?
- Go to your courses.

100
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,800
- Do you even know what my job is?
- The Wi-Fi is the least of our problems

101
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,760
The main elevator is broken.

102
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,760
The cafeteria can only spend
2.10 euros per meal.

103
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,120
The last group trip was in 2016, when
we visited the sewage treatment plant.

104
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,680
You've been paraplegic for three months
and your main problem is the Wi-Fi?

105
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,920
I'm willing to pay more.

106
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,000
I see you're also mentally impaired.
This isn't a hotel.

107
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,720
It's a rehab center. Time to eat.

108
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,840
- Cafeteria.
- What's on the menu?

109
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
Fish cakes.

110
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,880
- We had fish yesterday.
- You said we should use the leftovers.

111
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,280
May I sit here?

112
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,680
- Yes, of course.
- It was a joke.

113
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,440
Oh, sorry.

114
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
Are you also disabled?

115
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,840
No. I started working here
two weeks ago.

116
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,440
Oh, really?
So, are you a doctor?

117
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,880
No, I'm a career at the group home.

118
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,160
- Oh, for the...
- Yes, for the...

119
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,920
- What are you drawing?
- These are for the group home.

120
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,920
The new pencils are too sharp.
They might hurt themselves.

121
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,760
Do you need to train
for such a job, or...

122
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,200
Yes, you can do a training,
but I studied special education.

123
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,200
Now I want to see
if all that theory works in practice.

124
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,000
What about long-term?

125
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,640
- What do you mean?
- Well... What are your long-term plans?

126
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,600
What are your career goals?

127
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,400
I mean, making puzzles with
the disabled can't be your dream job.

128
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,440
Actually, it is my dream job.

129
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,760
And you should say
"people with disabilities".

130
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,680
How about you?

131
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,760
I only come here to have lunch.

132
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,120
They have the best fish cakes.

133
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,080
No, I'm over in rehab.
I'm Oliver, by the way.

134
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,440
Laura.

135
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,360
There's meant to be a great
yakitori place round the corner.

136
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,600
- Yaki...
- Yes, yakitori.

137
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,760
Japanese skewered meat.
There are also vegetarian options.

138
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,360
We could go there this weekend,
if you fancy...

139
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,520
My treat. I'll pay.

140
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,440
The thing is...
I can't this weekend, I'm afraid.

141
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,960
- I have...
- It's okay. It's okay. I get it.

142
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,240
Well, it was nice to meet you.

143
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,480
- Okay. And good luck.
- Thank you. Same to you.

144
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,480
The doctor said to take special care
of the back of the knees.

145
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,840
- Mom, he's a nurse, not a doctor.
- That's not the point.

146
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,160
- He meant... Can you do it?
- Yes.

147
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,440
- There shouldn't be any pressure marks.
- I know.

148
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,480
Great.

149
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,880
- Shall we go to the cafeteria?
- No, let's go out.

150
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,800
I can't stand the coffee here anymore.

151
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,000
Hello. I'd like a black coffee.

152
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,960
And an espresso macchiato.

153
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,240
- I'll bring them over.
- Thank you.

154
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,680
Is here okay?

155
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,200
Who designs this shit?

156
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,880
Oli, I brought you something.

157
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,440
Please, don't be mad,
but I've gone and bought it now.

158
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,120
SEX IN A WHEELCHAIR

159
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,120
- Oh, no! Please, no!
- It's not so bad.

160
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,480
Why do people think
that's my biggest problem?

161
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,480
It says you're still
in the denial stage.

162
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,680
And it also says
you can still have children.

163
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,760
- Your coffees.
- Why is it screwed to the floor?

164
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,480
- Oli.
- I mean...

165
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,760
I ordered an espresso macchiato.
That's a latte.

166
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,360
Oli... Are you okay?

167
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,120
Yes, Mom. I'm just great.

168
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,360
I need to get back to work.
I've got a meeting.

169
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,880
Thanks for the coffee.

170
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,560
Mr. Feldmann said you were
in an accident and that you...

171
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,000
No, there must have been
a misunderstanding.

172
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,480
So, you weren't in an accident?

173
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,880
No... I mean, I was. But only a minor
one. We can get started right away.

174
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,960
Very well then.
We should start by...

175
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,680
Mr. Kowalczyk?

176
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,240
Can you hear me now? Mr. Kowalczyk,
are you still on the line?

177
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,680
Yes. Is this better? No?

178
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,280
Mr. Kowalczyk?

179
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,120
You could also put the pendant
on a different necklace.

180
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,600
That's not a problem.

181
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,120
You need a somewhat
more delicate necklace.

182
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,400
Look at Miri and me.
We're completely different types.

183
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,840
That's exactly why
I'm standing next to her.

184
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Because it doesn't matter
whether you're wearing

185
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,600
something pink, blue,
white or black.

186
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Something that's anthracite
or apricot-colored.

187
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,520
Hey, Franzi.

188
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,680
- Hey! Leave it on!
- No, I won't.

189
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,560
We've got to get ready for Laura's
weird session. You can thank her.

190
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,840
Rainman?

191
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,360
Are you coming
to the Goldfish session?

192
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
Rainman?

193
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,040
- Getting cleany-clean.
- No, Rainman. What are you doing there?

194
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,800
You don't clean things in there!

195
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,600
Look at the state of you!

196
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,840
- Are we good?
- Rainman, that's a toilet.

197
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,200
- What's a toilet for?
- Making cleany-clean.

198
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,560
- That's a... No. Let's wash your hands.
- Cleany-clean. Yes.

199
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,560
Did you tell Magda?

200
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,360
Yes.

201
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,720
Magda, we're waiting.

202
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,840
Sorry I'm late, but your mom called.
She wants you to comb her chest hair.

203
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,280
- You're such a Nazi whore.
- Eddy!

204
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,280
- What? Just because she's blind?
- I heard that.

205
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,160
- So what? You wino.
- So... What's up?

206
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,120
- Good morning, my dear Magda.
- Morning.

207
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,160
We'll be having
a Goldfish session once a week.

208
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,200
- I was hoping you'd have forgotten.
- No.

209
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,040
Exactly! So, I thought we could all do
something together this afternoon.

210
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,480
We could cook something,
for example.

211
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,040
- Yes.
- Yes?

212
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,600
- Hey, Siri. Wake me up in an hour.
- Alarm has been set for...

213
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,880
Who knows how to make polenta?

214
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,240
Franzi? Yes!

215
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,600
A horse.

216
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,560
- I want to ride a horse.
- Forget it.

217
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,360
Franzi, that's a great idea.

218
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,120
I first have to talk to Ms. Zschetzsche
about that, but great idea.

219
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,160
Rainman,
what would you like to do?

220
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,480
- Oops.
- Sorry.

221
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,040
Tell me. Tomorrow.
You know who's coming? Mr...

222
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,760
Mr...

223
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,160
Mr. Mrs. Schmitz
is coming tomorrow, yeah.

224
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,720
We don't have to cook.
We could do something else.

225
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,880
But I want a horse!

226
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,800
Do it and we are good.

227
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,880
So, here's the source. Mr. Kowalczyk?

228
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,720
- What's going on?
- I can hear you.

229
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,160
Can you hear me now?

230
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,200
- Yes.
- Fantastic. I'm finally in my office.

231
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,160
- You were talking about a fixing date.
- Excuse me!

232
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,280
We recommend our clients a fixing date
at the end of the fourth quarter.

233
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,920
I think someone wants your attention.

234
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,280
- Is that your father?
- It's just the cleaning crew.

235
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,760
- Please clean this area later. Thanks.
- Cleany-clean. Yes.

236
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,240
- Is he in an old people's home?
- What?

237
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,400
Mr. Kowalczyk?
The connection's bad again.

238
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,360
I can hear you quite well.

239
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,560
I'll get back to you tomorrow

240
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,240
with an asset allocation strategy,
figures and charts.

241
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
- Okay?
- That might be for the best.

242
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,520
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Franzi... Rainman.

243
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,400
- Are you crazy?
- Yes.

244
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,160
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

245
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,080
Nothing. I'm working.

246
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,440
Please, continue doing
whatever it is you were doing.

247
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,000
I was doing important work. You can't
just pop in and push Rainman away!

248
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,080
- Rainman?
- The guy you pushed away.

249
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,280
- His name is Rainman?
- It's Rainer.

250
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,000
But we call him that.
He loves the film... Whatever!

251
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,240
It's okay. I'll find some place else.

252
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,240
By the way,
I just want to make it clear

253
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,240
that it had nothing to do
with your disability.

254
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
What?

255
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,040
Not wanting to go have yokitori
with you.

256
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,720
- "Yakitori", but don't worry about it.
- I'm serious.

257
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,480
The wheelchair isn't a problem.

258
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,120
Okay. What's the problem then?

259
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,040
Don't take it personally,
but you're just not my type.

260
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,880
What kind of type am I?

261
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,040
- The banker type.
- I'm a portfolio manager.

262
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,160
Oh, that's completely different.
To make the rich even richer.

263
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,800
You can skip the lecture.
I know all the clichés.

264
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,880
- Fine, then.
- Yeah, fine.

265
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,480
Just a sec. I'm going to the window.

266
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,240
Mr. Overrath?

267
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,920
Just a moment.

268
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,760
- So...
- Mr. Overrath?

269
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,960
- Yes, I can hear you now.
- Wonderful, Mr. Overrath.

270
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,800
- I can hear you now.
- I can hear you too.

271
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,400
I'm Mr. Flütsch and I'm calling
from the GDNC Bank in Zürich.

272
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,400
- Yes.
- Regarding your safety deposit box.

273
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,200
Upon request,
we had to inform the German tax office

274
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:22,120
that you've rented a safe deposit box
here in our vault for three years.

275
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,120
If you're suspected
of having committed tax fraud...

276
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,560
How... How come they requested that?

277
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,040
I'm afraid I can't answer that.

278
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,040
If you're suspected of having
committed tax fraud, we'll have to...

279
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,560
- When did they send the request?
- They sent it this morning.

280
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,760
- If you're suspected of...
- Mr. Flütsch, could I call you back?

281
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Oliver?

282
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,040
- Julius, we have to go to Zürich now.
- I can't.

283
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,200
What? Don't you understand
how serious this is? Julius?

284
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,760
Not on the phone.

285
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,000
I wanted to pick up some flowers
on the way here, but I'm not sure...

286
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,520
- Of what?
- If that's even a thing.

287
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,960
Well, you're not typically ill.

288
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,560
It's okay.
Why couldn't you talk on the phone?

289
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,120
Tell me.

290
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Oliver...

291
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,720
I'm fucked. Totally fucked.

292
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,080
I know you were in an accident
and all that, but I'm fucked.

293
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
And why is that?

294
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,840
I got caught at the border.

295
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,160
I even borrowed our intern's car.

296
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,640
The perfect cover.

297
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,560
And I played it super cool.

298
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,160
But they pull everyone aside.

299
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,200
- I had 200,000 in the car with me.
- Oh, shit.

300
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,960
Did you know
they train dogs to smell money?

301
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,520
Okay... So, what now?

302
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,840
They knew everything.
About my Swiss account,

303
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,440
that I liquidated my assets,
about my safety deposit box...

304
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,600
Who's "they"?

305
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,720
The German tax office.

306
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,120
They went to my bank with a court order

307
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,280
and opened my safety deposit box.

308
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,520
700,000! All gone.

309
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,760
- I've got a court hearing in two weeks.
- Did you come by car?

310
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,200
- How else?
- We have to go clear my box in Zürich.

311
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,880
Are you deaf?
Their dogs can smell money.

312
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,480
- Mr. Flütsch called.
- Who?

313
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,320
From the bank. They know about my box
and could show up at any moment.

314
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,040
- What's inside?
- Cash. 1.2 million.

315
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,200
1.2 million? I just wanted to warn you.
The rest is on you.

316
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,000
Warn me? You wouldn't have told me
if I hadn't called.

317
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,640
Zürich is only two hours away.

318
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,080
I can't even take a shit on my own! How
am I supposed to smuggle 1.2 million?

319
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,760
- Make a self-disclosure.
- Too late! Plus, I need that money.

320
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,760
Being disabled is expensive!
Take the cushion I'm sitting on.

321
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,320
Non-disabled pay 15 euros
for one at IKEA.

322
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,880
For me it's 1,200 euro.

323
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,360
Specially designed for my ass,
which I can't even feel!

324
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,560
- Maybe you could...
- What?

325
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,960
You could put the money in condoms
and stick them up your behind.

326
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,600
One condom easily holds
fifty 500-euro notes.

327
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,520
That makes 25,000 per trip...

328
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,200
You want me to stick
my money up my ass?

329
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,480
Coke dealers do it all the time.
It's not such a bad idea.

330
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,360
And dogs can't smell
things that are up your ass.

331
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,840
Plus, you don't feel
anything there anyway.

332
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,680
Hey, you know what?
Thanks for coming by.

333
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,880
- Oliver! I'm also fucked, you know.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

334
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,040
Fuck!

335
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,520
Can I also use the disabled bathroom?

336
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,880
BILLY BOY CONDOMS

337
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,680
"FEELING SAFE"

338
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,040
- Oliver!
- Laura.

339
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:32,360
I'm looking for a Wi-Fi booster.
Do you know if they sell them here?

340
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,240
I don't, but I imagine you'd have
to ask at an electronics store.

341
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,920
Yes, you're right.

342
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,120
I thought as much. Okay.

343
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,800
- Oliver?
- Yes?

344
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,600
You could also work
in our group home.

345
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,160
Seeing you have issues
with the Wi-Fi...

346
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,440
But only if you don't disturb us.
We could give it a go.

347
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Thanks. That's so nice of you.

348
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,800
- See you.
- See you.

349
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,320
- Here's your 6.22 euros change.
- Thank you.

350
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,680
I'm sorry. So sorry.

351
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,040
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

352
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,720
It goes off sometimes.
Just walk on through.

353
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,080
- Okay. Okay.
- The exit's to the left.

354
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,840
- Okay!
- Just let me know if you need any help.

355
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,840
No, thanks.

356
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,080
Is that online banking for stocks?

357
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,560
Yes, exactly.

358
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,760
I know a bit about the internet.
I do stuff online too. Online poker.

359
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,080
Bitcoins. Ever heard of bitcoins?

360
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,640
I do bitcoin stuff.

361
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,680
- You should go for it.
- What's up with him?

362
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,720
- He's just not with it.
- Why the helmet?

363
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,240
He's autistic.

364
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,840
Is he gifted in something?

365
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,280
No idea. Well...

366
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,520
He's just autistic.

367
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,720
So, come on in.

368
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,600
So, guys...

369
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,720
I had an idea.

370
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,640
As we're the Goldfish group,
we also need the appropriate animal.

371
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,680
Can I have some peace here!

372
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,880
- Three guesses what's underneath this.
- A horse.

373
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,800
No, a horse would be
way too dangerous in here.

374
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,600
- Rainman, perhaps you have an idea?
- Yes. I'll be fine.

375
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,160
Very well then. I'll tell you.
It's a... goldfish!

376
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,400
- A goldfish isn't an animal.
- Of course it is.

377
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,320
We can also name our goldfish.

378
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,560
- Goldi.
- Goldi.

379
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,080
We have to feed Goldi,
so he can grow big and strong.

380
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,280
Did you know that goldfish can live
up to 30 years if you take good...

381
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,720
- Cleany-clean!
- No!

382
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,200
- No! No!
- Rainman!

383
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,440
That's exactly what I meant, Laura.

384
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,120
Why would you bring it here?
Give me that.

385
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,840
- Are you mad?
- You can't clean things there.

386
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,680
- No, I'm not mad.
- Shit.

387
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,560
- Don't worry.
- Where's Goldi?

388
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,760
- Are you mad?
- He must be hiding somewhere.

389
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,640
- No, there's no fish here.
- Yes, there is. Over there...

390
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,680
- This shit...
- No!

391
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,960
No! No! No!

392
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,920
Come on, Goldi.
You poor fish! Come here.

393
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,920
- Shit!
- Are you mad?

394
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,040
Are you mad? Are we good?

395
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,200
- Are we good?
- Rainman, everything is fine.

396
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,680
- No one's mad.
- Goldi!

397
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,960
Save your breath.
He needs to shake it off.

398
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,960
- It was all too much for him.
- You think so?

399
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,560
I told you not to get things like that.

400
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,760
They'll never change.
Did you download the song?

401
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,840
He's autistic!
Only this song will calm him down.

402
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,440
Forget about Coldplay.

403
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,160
- No!
- Goldi! Goldi?

404
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,440
- Can you hear me?
- What are you doing, Franzi?

405
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,720
Great idea, Laura.

406
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,440
- Can you hear me?
- Perfect. Just perfect.

407
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,000
- Goldi?
- Franzi, get away from me.

408
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,560
Awesome!

409
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,480
- Do you do that often?
- What? This?

410
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,920
- Yes.
- Only during the day and at night.

411
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,280
I mean the number
you did in the store.

412
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,840
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

413
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
Don't they ever look in your bag?

414
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,200
Being disabled has its advantages.

415
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,240
May I ask you a personal question?

416
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,640
Why are you here?
I mean, living here with these...

417
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,200
You could manage on your own.

418
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,320
Why do you ask?
Are you Jerry Springer or something?

419
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,560
Take a sip.

420
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,280
Here's to disability.

421
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,920
To disability.

422
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,080
- Camel riding?
- Camel therapy.

423
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,480
Well, you do ride the camels too,
but for therapeutic reasons.

424
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,400
Franzi helped me come up
with the idea.

425
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
You know that she loves animals.

426
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,480
- She loves horses.
- Yes.

427
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,480
But, I mean...
Camels are the better horses.

428
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,360
They're a lot more curious
and a lot more... quiet.

429
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,920
It's all in the brochure.

430
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,040
Don't take me wrong. It's noble of you,
wanting to pay for the trip and all,

431
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,840
but why Switzerland?

432
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,440
There's no camel therapy here.

433
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,080
Plus, Saphira is the best in her field.

434
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,280
- Is Saphira the camel?
- Yes. No. Saphira is the therapist.

435
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,280
She specializes in disabled...
people with disabilities.

436
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,000
It's all in the brochure.

437
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,600
- I imagine it'll cost you a fair bit.
- Yes, but it's not about that.

438
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,600
You know...

439
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,360
How can I put it?

440
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,560
That troop... The Goldfish troop
welcomed me with open arms and with...

441
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,320
their Wi-Fi and everything.

442
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,040
They're just so welcoming.

443
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,040
I want to give something back to them,
Ms. Zschetzsche.

444
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,560
I've been applying
for a grant for years

445
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,800
and they always say
there's no money.

446
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,720
But then they go and spend
100 million on a museum

447
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,760
for Prussian soup bowl paintings!

448
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,920
- You're a good man, Oliver.
- Yeah?

449
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,520
- You can go on the trip.
- Thanks, Ms. Zschetzsche.

450
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,520
Go tell Laura. She'll be happy.

451
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,320
Hey.

452
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,400
Are you okay?

453
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,360
I should just go work
at Burger King again.

454
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,200
- You used to work there?
- Yes. It was less stressful.

455
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,160
"No cable cars lead
to the highest peaks."

456
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,000
Reinhold Messner.
He gave us a motivational seminar.

457
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,520
My boss is a fan of his.
He invited him to give a seminar.

458
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,960
His feet are all crippled.
Not my boss'. Messner's.

459
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,480
They'd frozen, so they had
to amputate seven of his toes.

460
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,840
Oliver. Oliver,
could you please stop talking?

461
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,360
Laura, I'm actually here to give you

462
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,080
some good news.

463
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,560
SAPHIRA'S CAMEL FARM

464
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,120
Apple, anyone?

465
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Thanks.

466
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,280
- I should be thanking you.
- Franzi, scoot over.

467
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,120
- I'll be fine. Yes.
- Great. Out you go.

468
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,240
- A fast car. Yes.
- Will you get down from there?

469
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,640
- Magda, buckle up.
- No. Don't buckle up.

470
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,560
- Do it.
- No! If she does, she'll squish Goldi.

471
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,600
Don't worry about him.
He's preserved in alcohol.

472
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,760
Franzi, I'll take good care of Goldi.

473
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,520
Eddy, I heard you left your mom
for a younger woman.

474
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,800
Estimated arrival time:
Two hours and 13 minutes.

475
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,840
- I want a Fanta.
- I'll give you a Fanta.

476
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,640
Every time you have one,
you need to pee. So, no.

477
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,120
- But I want one.
- No.

478
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,400
- Yes.
- No.

479
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,880
- Yes.
- I said "no".

480
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:22,360
- I want a Fanta.
- You're not getting one.

481
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,120
Look! Saphira's waiting for us over
there. It's going to be great, guys.

482
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,200
Is Saphira the camel?

483
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,800
No. Saphira is the therapist.

484
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,760
A fast horse. Yes.

485
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,640
I'm so proud, you know.

486
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,280
Hello, everyone.

487
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,160
- Hi.
- You must be generous Oliver.

488
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,640
The noble prince Laura spoke about.

489
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,680
Noble? Not really.

490
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,920
- Hello, I'm Eddy Patzke. I'm the carer.
- Hello.

491
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,440
Are you a secret millionaire?

492
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,880
- Do you know what I mean?
- I'm afraid I don't.

493
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,440
Saphira? Is this drinking water?

494
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,840
Oliver, that woman is really weird.

495
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,560
Psycho.

496
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,360
Franzi, you can ride on Ali.

497
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,400
- I hate camels.
- Well, the trip was so worth it.

498
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,480
- Magda, want to be the first to get on?
- No, no.

499
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,520
- I want to ride.
- Great, Rainer.

500
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,680
See, Franzi. Ali is a nice camel.

501
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,520
But I want a horse.

502
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,000
Ali's my friend.

503
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,280
Look, Franzi. You can feed him.
Ali loves bread.

504
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,080
I hate Ali.

505
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,400
Franzi, don't run!

506
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,160
Franzi, don't run!

507
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,800
Franzi, don't be scared!
Stay where you are!

508
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,440
Oh, man! Will they ever leave?

509
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,240
- Sure you don't need anything?
- Yes, thanks.

510
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,480
There's Moroccan peppermint tea.
Drink some.

511
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,280
We'll be back from
the healing spring in an hour.

512
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,400
Franzi, hold on tight.

513
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,800
- Bye, Oliver! See you soon.
- They're gone.

514
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,840
Let's go.

515
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,320
Let's go!

516
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,880
- A lot more work than I'd imagined.
- Complain on the way. Hurry.

517
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,440
- We've only got an hour.
- Oliver.

518
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,320
500 would be a fairer price.

519
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,400
What do you want from me?
We agreed on 300.

520
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,800
Plus, I told you to wear
something decent.

521
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,960
Like what?

522
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,240
Something that doesn't show
your belly.

523
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,360
Know what? Either you give
me 500, or I won't do it.

524
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,360
- 300 is 30 times the minimum wage!
- Ask Laura then. Sure she'll do it.

525
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,440
Come on. Fuck it. 500 it is.

526
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,240
Thanks, Oliver.

527
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,800
The entrance is over there.

528
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,040
Hey!

529
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,360
Quickly. The pants. Eddy?

530
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,560
Come on!

531
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,360
So, tape me up.

532
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,680
Oh, yes. Of course. Here's your share.

533
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,160
Know what? Enjoy yourself. Here.

534
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,200
Now, tape it onto me.

535
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,480
- Eddy!
- Oliver...

536
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,600
- I want more.
- More?

537
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,000
I want at least double.

538
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,320
- What am I saying?
- Are you kidding me?

539
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,760
Give that back, you fat,
useless nothing!

540
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,560
- I've earned that too! What'll you do?
- Give it back!

541
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,760
- Will you call the cops?
- Give it!

542
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,760
- What you gonna do about it?
- Give it back, you jerk!

543
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,320
- No!
- You jerk!

544
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,400
I won't get it back.

545
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,680
I've been cleaning up
your disabled shit for ten years.

546
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,640
I deserve this, my friend.

547
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,480
Let's tape you up now.
No problem.

548
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,240
They're back.

549
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,240
So, make sure you smile, now.

550
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,680
Hey, man! There's a step.

551
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,240
Hey! How did it go?

552
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,480
It was so nice!
Everyone had a great time.

553
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,600
- Shame you couldn't come.
- Yeah. Real shame.

554
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,640
I'd never heard of camel
therapy before.

555
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,600
I did a lot of research on it.

556
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,360
Is it like dolphin therapy,
but with animals?

557
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,920
Thanks, Eddy.
You can go now. Thanks.

558
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,400
Saphira said that wheelchair users
often ride her camels.

559
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,280
- Really? How interesting.
- Yes.

560
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,600
- I could ask her if you want.
- No, thank you.

561
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,480
But it's quite safe up there.
We could also strap you in.

562
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,440
I really don't want to.

563
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,360
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Really.

564
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,880
- It's so beautiful here.
- Yes.

565
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,440
Very beautiful.

566
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,400
Yeah...

567
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,680
I'd like to apologize to you.

568
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,560
- For what?
- Well, for...

569
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,440
For being prejudiced.
And for being mean to bankers.

570
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,920
- There's no need...
- Yes, that was...

571
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,000
- Laura. You really don't have to.
- I went too far.

572
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,240
No, please!
There's nothing to apologize about.

573
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,200
Okay.

574
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,520
I'm free this weekend, by the way.

575
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,240
In case you fancy some Japanese.

576
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,280
But I'll pay for my own food.

577
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,080
There's my secret millionaire.

578
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,120
- Your turn.
- Thanks, but I don't want to go riding.

579
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,480
No problem.
We'll have a talk therapy session.

580
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,240
With Helmut.

581
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,760
Tell Helmut how you feel.

582
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,080
I really don't know...

583
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,880
I mean, is this even a thing?
Talk therapy with a camel?

584
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,160
Yeah...

585
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,080
Okay. Helmut...

586
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,800
My name is Oliver.

587
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,040
I'm doing well
and I'm quite confident...

588
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,880
that everything
will turn out really well.

589
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,280
Helmut says you're not relaxed.

590
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,920
Just be yourself.
Pretend I'm not here.

591
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,480
I really don't see the point
of all this.

592
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,520
Just sit back and relax.

593
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,640
So, I...

594
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,400
I think that's enough, don't you?

595
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,200
- What's that?
- The famous fancy-pants.

596
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,600
Come, Helmut.
We didn't see anything.

597
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,400
Come on.

598
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,240
Stay calm.

599
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,520
- Did you rob a bank or something?
- No!

600
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,120
It's all mine. I didn't steal it.

601
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,160
- Okay, so why...
- Why is the money strapped to my legs?

602
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,840
- Because I didn't want you to find out.
- Find out about what?

603
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,320
These are my savings
that were in Zürich.

604
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,760
And as we're close by,
I thought I'd go pick some up.

605
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,720
Why not just transfer it?

606
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,040
- It's dirty money.
- No! No!

607
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,960
- It's complicated.
- So, it is then!

608
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,680
- It's well-earned money.
- How did you earn it?

609
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,160
I... On the stock market.

610
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:27,480
Come on now, Laura! Please!

611
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,760
Let's not argue about this.
We had such a nice trip.

612
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,240
- They all loved it...
- Wait a moment.

613
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:37,360
Did we come here so you could
smuggle your money over the border?

614
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,840
You needed a vehicle!

615
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,080
- No. That's not the case.
- What is the case then?

616
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,480
This is just...
Okay. I'm going to tell Eddy.

617
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,680
- Eddy already knows.
- What?

618
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,360
Eddy already knows.

619
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,280
- Are you serious?
- I didn't want to involve you in this.

620
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,880
- I wanted to protect you.
- If they catch us, I'll be in for it.

621
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,040
Laura, hey! No one will check
our bus at the border. Really!

622
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,160
This is what we'll do.
We'll drive to Zürich

623
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,160
and you'll put the money back
where you found it.

624
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,280
We're not driving over the border!

625
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,760
- No one will check us at the border!
- End of discussion!

626
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,080
I won't let you fool me again.
I'm so stupid!

627
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,360
I apologized to you
for being prejudiced!

628
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,320
How ridiculous is that?

629
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,720
Shit.

630
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,360
What's going on, then?

631
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,160
Did someone die? Don't want to find
out when the smell gives it away.

632
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,400
What?

633
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,000
So beautiful.

634
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,160
I want to be that pretty too.

635
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,920
With a pretty coat, dress and socks.
I want to be pretty.

636
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,240
Being pretty
isn't important in life, Franzi.

637
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,920
But I want it!
I'm not a kid anymore.

638
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,880
I have a big head
and I want beautiful things.

639
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,480
That fucking camel!
That stinking freaking creature!

640
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,800
The whole trip was all for nothing.

641
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,480
Just to be clear, your share
is also going back to the bank.

642
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,000
Payment only upon
successful crossing of the border.

643
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,160
"Secret millionaire."
Up yours, Saphira.

644
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,480
Hey, shouldn't we stop?
It's red.

645
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,040
Looks aren't important.
What's important is inner beauty.

646
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,880
- What?
- Inner beauty is what's in your heart.

647
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,600
Your heart is here, on the left.

648
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,680
Things that come
from the heart are good.

649
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,880
To hell with inner beauty.
I want glamour!

650
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,760
- What was that?
- No idea.

651
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,320
- Eddy is fast.
- What?

652
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,400
Wait here. I'll be right back.

653
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,720
Out of the way!

654
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,000
What the...

655
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,320
Careful!

656
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:36,920
Careful!

657
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,600
Come on. Come down here.

658
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,520
Be a man and come down here!
Come on, then.

659
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,560
Come down here!

660
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,720
Come down here, you asshole!

661
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,360
- Oliver...
- I'll kill you!

662
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,760
I have to go now.
Tell those idiots to kiss my ass.

663
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,720
Oh! And tell Magda I hate her.

664
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,680
Could you come to the ramp, please?

665
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,760
Where's Laura?

666
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,160
You should know.
She ran after you. Call her.

667
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,960
What the hell happened?

668
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:30,280
- Shit!
- What happened?

669
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,200
- Eddy ran off with the money.
- All of it?

670
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,600
- No, just with his share.
- How much?

671
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,200
100,000.

672
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,280
100,000? Euros?

673
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,800
100,000 euros?

674
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,080
- 100,000?
- Yes!

675
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,480
I want 100,000 too.

676
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,760
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, listen here.

677
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,800
You'll give me 100,000 euros too!

678
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,280
- Are you blackmailing me, Magda?
- No, I'm just trying to help you.

679
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,920
We can pull this off without Eddy
and Laura. I'll do it for 100,000.

680
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,760
Great idea, having a blind person
drive us over the border.

681
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,560
No, you idiot! Rainman will drive.

682
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,160
- Okay. Right foot.
- Fast.

683
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,920
- Left foot.
- Wednesday.

684
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,520
- This is a bad idea.
- Quiet! We need to concentrate.

685
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,280
Rainman, you can do it.

686
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:27,360
- No, put the gear in "D".
- "D" for Daisy, please.

687
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,840
- Wow, Rainman!
- Hey!

688
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,080
That's it, Rainman.

689
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,080
- You're an excellent driver.
- An excellent driver.

690
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,440
- Yes. Keep your eyes on the road.
- That's Laura's cell.

691
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,600
- Hello?
- Magda, where are you?

692
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,040
It's Laura. Hello!

693
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,560
Where the hell are you?
Where's the bus?

694
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,800
- We're in the bus.
- But where is it?

695
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,840
Don't take it personally,
but we're heading back.

696
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,520
- Stop the bus now!
- No, we're not going to do that.

697
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:16,280
- Pass the phone to Eddy.
- Yeah, Eddy... Well, Eddy...

698
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,400
- You can't.
- I can't, because...

699
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,600
- Eddy's driving.
- Rainman's driving.

700
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,560
Pass me the phone.

701
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:28,960
- Sorry, Laura. It was Magda's idea.
- Oliver, stop the bus, right now!

702
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,280
Let's meet over the border
once we're through.

703
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,200
Take a taxi. I'll pay for it.

704
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,440
- Oliver, I'm going to kill you!
- Okay. Will do. Bye.

705
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,760
- I'm an excellent driver.
- Yes.

706
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,000
Yes, darling.

707
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,840
We haven't discussed
Rainman's share yet.

708
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,040
What?
But he didn't ask for anything.

709
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,240
Smuggling your money
over the border will cost you!

710
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,760
He doesn't even know what money is!

711
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,120
- How much does a bottle of water cost?
- Still water, please.

712
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,120
- How much does it cost?
- 50 euros.

713
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,320
Okay.
And how much does a car cost?

714
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,280
- A fast car?
- Yeah, why not?

715
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,560
- 50 euros?
- That's that then.

716
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,800
How much do you want
for driving the bus?

717
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,320
Fifty... thousand euros.

718
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,480
What the heck?
Okay, I'll pay him 1,000 euros.

719
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,800
- He said 50,000 euros!
- No!

720
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,160
First, he said 50 and then changed it
to 1,000. There was a pause in between.

721
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,720
50,000. Are we good?

722
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,280
- Let's talk about it later.
- And Franzi?

723
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,520
- But she's just sitting there.
- You don't have a choice.

724
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,480
- How much do you want?
- I don't need any money.

725
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,520
See? That's great. Not everyone
is as greedy as you, Magda.

726
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,560
- I want glamour.
- Glamour?

727
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,360
Rainman, left leg!

728
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,680
- Glamour.
- What does it look like?

729
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,440
- It's pretty.
- And?

730
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,200
- It's very pink.
- And fluffy.

731
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,240
- But mainly pink.
- And pretty.

732
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,400
- Sounds like Tiffy from Sesame Street.
- Yes, and I want it.

733
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:03,600
And you can have it.

734
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,920
Damn it!
What kind of shit is this?

735
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,960
Franzi, could you help me?
From behind.

736
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,320
Could you lend us a hand too?
Wait a moment, Rainman.

737
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,760
- Rainman, let the man through.
- Wait a moment, man.

738
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,040
- Oh, God!
- Okay. Now, pull it.

739
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,200
Thanks.

740
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,120
- May I help you?
- Yes.

741
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,200
Tomorrow?
Guess who's coming! Mr...

742
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,800
Guess who. Mr...

743
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,360
- Mr... Mrs. Schmitz.
- Hey, over here! Talk to me.

744
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,200
We'd like the pink coat
in the window.

745
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,320
For Franzi, the lady over here.

746
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,760
But that's an Agostini.

747
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,920
What do you mean with "but"?

748
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,200
Nothing.

749
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:51,440
You said, "But it's an Agostini".
Why did you say "but"?

750
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:56,040
To indicate the price. And I'm not
sure we have it in her size.

751
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,960
You're not wearing any socks.

752
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,920
Plus, it's not pink,
it's French Rose.

753
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:10,680
Maybe you'll be able to find
something in a different store.

754
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:17,160
He's not wearing socks,
because he's wearing penny loafers.

755
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,680
Just like Elvis did
in "Jailhouse Rock" in 1957.

756
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,880
- Know why they're called penny loafers?
- Because he got them at J.C. Penney?

757
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,720
People used to put a penny
in the shoe's slot for good luck.

758
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,800
Hence the name. And you usually
wear them without socks.

759
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,440
- Come. We'll spend our money elsewhere.
- Wait!

760
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,320
Just give me a second.

761
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,920
I'll check if we have it in your size.

762
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,720
- There. It really suits you.
- Yes.

763
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:52,960
- Is it comfy?
- Yes.

764
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,720
- Great.
- I'm ready.

765
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,000
Hey! Yes, that's great!

766
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:01,560
- It looks good, right?
- Get out of the way.

767
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,600
- Can we go now?
- I'd like to show you some shoes.

768
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,160
- May I ask what the occasion is?
- Lunch.

769
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,040
Okay,
and what sort of lunch will it be?

770
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:15,120
You each get your own tray,
and then you get potatoes, meatballs,

771
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:18,600
broccoli and such...
And then you get sauce.

772
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,760
- And... I hate potatoes!
- Okay.

773
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,240
- And camels.
- Okay.

774
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,760
I know what lunch is,
but where will it be taking place?

775
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,840
- At the center.
- The center! So more like urban chic?

776
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,160
The center for people
with disabilities.

777
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,040
Can we go now?

778
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,240
I want glitter shoes.
Like the ones Taylor Swift wears.

779
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,600
Do you have a financial ceiling?

780
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,000
Do we look
like we have financial issues?

781
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,400
- Champagne?
- Yes!

782
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,160
- You're driving.
- What a shame.

783
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:21,720
- Can I keep it on?
- Sure. Follow me to the register.

784
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,160
Could you give us a moment?

785
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:28,880
Listen up.

786
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,440
- On three, pull down my pants.
- Okay.

787
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,600
- One, two...
- One, two, three.

788
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,280
Okay. Keep going. Keep going.

789
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,640
Yes.

790
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,360
What's that?

791
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,720
- Those are pressure marks.
- Shit.

792
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,040
We have to put it somewhere else.

793
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:03,080
- May I show you some cosmetics?
- That's out of the question.

794
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,240
I want make-up!

795
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,360
Okay.

796
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,120
Michi, raise your arm. Michi?

797
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,760
- Michi?
- Michi, arm up.

798
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,000
Michi.

799
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,960
Michi, arm up, please.

800
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,920
Michi? Hello? Put your arm up!

801
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,760
Put that stupid thing away!

802
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,720
I'm sorry.

803
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:29,960
Hey... I'll buy you a new one, okay?

804
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,120
Sorry.

805
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,840
I promise.

806
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,960
It's the best thing for wrinkles.

807
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,840
It's a concealer for mature skin,
but the sooner you get used to...

808
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,880
- Okay. We'd like to pay now.
- Great!

809
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,520
Let's go, guys.

810
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:49,080
- What are you doing, Rainman?
- Okay.

811
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,400
That makes a total
of 20,900 Swiss francs.

812
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,520
Or would you rather pay in euros?

813
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,200
- In euros.
- That would be 17,500 euros.

814
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,600
You won't find a girlfriend
with make-up on.

815
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,120
Ever thought that perhaps
he doesn't want a girlfriend?

816
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,200
- What do you mean?
- Maybe he's gay.

817
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:09,600
- Magda, is Rainman gay?
- Why should I care?

818
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:11,800
No idea. What do you think?

819
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,640
Just because I'm gay
doesn't mean I can tell who's gay.

820
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,200
Especially nowadays.

821
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,080
My gaydar is a bit rusty
now that I've got a partner.

822
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,240
But I'm 70% certain that he's gay.
Has he ever had a girlfriend?

823
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,120
- No.
- 80%. What's his favorite song?

824
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,520
"Self Control".

825
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,920
- Laura Branigan. 90%.
- I'm gay.

826
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,680
- 99%.
- I'm gay. I'm so proud, you know?

827
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:10,520
- Is that Eddy?
- Where?

828
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,360
- What is he doing?
- Where?

829
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,760
With... With my money.

830
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,880
Magda, give me your cane.

831
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,520
- The Unico model.
- Beautiful.

832
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,280
- Bediamonded with baguette diamonds.
- Baguette. Great. Baguette.

833
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,480
I have an affinity to Swiss watches...

834
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,000
- Where's my money?
- I don't have it!

835
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,400
- Where's my money?
- Leave me alone!

836
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,520
- Is everything okay?
- Magda!

837
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,680
- Magda!
- Magda!

838
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,160
- Grab him!
- Got him!

839
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,720
- You bitch! I bit my tongue.
- Where's my money, Eddy?

840
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:49,600
Where's the fucking money?

841
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,320
- Where's the money, you jerk?
- Where is it?

842
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,400
What's that?
Did you buy it with my money?

843
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,920
Where is it? Magda, check his pockets.

844
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,080
Franzi, check the bags.

845
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,240
- Where's my money?
- Nada.

846
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,400
Don't touch my finger! Hey! Hey!

847
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,880
- Anyone need help?
- You will, if you don't beat it!

848
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,120
- I'm gay.
- Check his underpants.

849
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,320
Magda!

850
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,040
Is that all?

851
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,640
Is that all?

852
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,640
- Is that all?
- Yes!

853
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,800
- Hit him again if you want.
- Sure.

854
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:28,240
I'll tell everyone
what happened at the Christmas party!

855
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,880
- Christmas party? Do I want to know?
- Nope.

856
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,680
- Is he dead?
- Shit. I think you went too far, Magda.

857
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,200
Franzi, place your ear on his heart.

858
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,240
Well?

859
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,160
- "Well" what?
- Hear anything?

860
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:57,240
- No inner beauty.
- Just give me his hand.

861
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:03,600
Okay, he's just taking a nap.

862
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,000
Everything's fine.
Franzi, I need your help.

863
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,400
That's in francs, right?

864
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,880
Yeah...

865
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:25,280
Yeah... Listen. We might have
to wait a bit at the border.

866
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,960
- My bag's in another car.
- What car?

867
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,040
My money is in another car,
but I'll pay you at the border.

868
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,600
- You don't have any money?
- I do, but it's in another car.

869
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:59,600
Just follow the road,
no matter what, okay?

870
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,840
- Yes.
- Okay?

871
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,680
- Repeat it.
- No matter what.

872
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,600
- No, the first part.
- I'll be fine.

873
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:08,240
Hey, four kilometers to the border.
Awesome!

874
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,920
People, we're so awesome!

875
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:15,440
We're the most awesome
disabled troop that's ever existed!

876
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:19,040
Screw the Avengers.
Screw the A-Team. We're the...

877
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,440
- B-Team.
- We're the B-Team!

878
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,520
- Bang! B-Team!
- I'm done.

879
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:26,440
No, you're not done.
You're Iron Man.

880
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,120
What am I saying?
You're way cooler.

881
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,040
You're the Rainman,
an excellent driver.

882
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,200
- I want to be something too!
- Who do you want to be?

883
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,320
- Wonder Woman?
- Taylor Swift.

884
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,760
- Taylor Swift? Okay.
- Yes.

885
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,840
- Yes, okay. I'm done.
- What? What do you mean?

886
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:43,600
- I'm done.
- What? Why?

887
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:46,000
- Why is he doing that?
- Doing what?

888
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,520
- No. Not now. You have to drive.
- What?

889
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,000
- What is he doing?
- Careful! Steer!

890
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,400
He has to shake it off.

891
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,640
- Steer!
- Oh no! He has to shake it off.

892
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,600
- Magda, steer the bus!
- Play his song!

893
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,760
Is it on YouTube?

894
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:03,200
Hey, Siri.
Play "Self Control" by Laura Branigan.

895
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,440
Step on it!

896
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:12,680
- Why won't they overtake us?
- I think they're disabled.

897
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,520
- "Self Control!"
- Please repeat.

898
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,600
- Rainman, right!
- "Self Control!"

899
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,360
No, left!
Right is the gas pedal, you idiot!

900
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,040
- Magda, take the wheel!
- I'm blind! Duh!

901
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,640
- Let's do it like that.
- Calm down, Rainman.

902
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,720
Hey, Siri.
Play "Self Control" by Laura...

903
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,040
Franzi, go to the front!

904
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:32,920
Siri, "Self Control."

905
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,840
I've understood your request.

906
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:39,920
Franzi, I think your goldfish's journey
has come to an end.

907
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,560
Bye, Goldi.

908
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,320
Goldi was a good fish.

909
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,640
Yes, he was really good at swimming.

910
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:15,520
He was the best swimmer
I've ever met.

911
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,560
We named our group home after him.

912
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:24,360
He was a part of Magda,
but also a part of us.

913
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,800
And he had big dreams.

914
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,640
But life's not always fair.

915
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,160
He could've achieved anything.

916
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,440
He was still young and at the height
of his creative powers.

917
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,800
He swam alone,
day and night in his aquarium,

918
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,440
thinking that if he just kept swimming

919
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,360
he'd eventually reach the ocean.

920
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,560
He didn't realize
he'd been swimming around in circles.

921
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:10,560
We deliver Goldi's body to Switzerland,

922
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:15,200
for thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory forever...

923
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,120
- Amen.
- Amen.

924
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:18,800
That was nice.

925
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:23,120
Now call Laura
and tell her to come pick us up.

926
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:26,240
- Her phone's in the bus.
- Then call Zschetzsche.

927
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,680
- Backing out?
- You'll get your money back.

928
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,760
No, Magda. That's out
of the question. Let's do it.

929
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:36,280
I know Rainman better than you do.
He won't drive any further.

930
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,360
You drive then. Hey, I'm serious!

931
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,680
- Don't you have a license?
- I do.

932
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:45,120
I was on the ground staff
at an airport.

933
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,480
- See?
- But that was 16 years ago!

934
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,800
You drive the bus and I'll steer, okay?

935
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,360
The trip's over. Now, leave me alone.

936
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,920
It was your idea to get Rainman
to drive!

937
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,080
I wanted to help you, you asshole!

938
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:00,960
We're so close
and now you're chickening out?

939
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,240
God damn it! Where's the bus?

940
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:06,840
Know what I think?
I think you can't drive.

941
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,440
You were the worst driver ever
before you went blind.

942
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,600
Franzi, grab my legs, please.

943
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:20,000
Franzi... Magda, wait.

944
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:24,960
- Magda, what are you doing?
- Didn't you want me to drive?

945
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,640
Then let me steer.

946
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:31,040
- Get off my steering wheel!
- Hey. Magda, that'll never work.

947
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,560
Hands off! Just tell me
which way to go.

948
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,280
Okay, okay.
But slow down, okay?

949
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,040
- I can drive. Just give me directions.
- Left.

950
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,800
Left, please!

951
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,760
Straight.
A bit more to the right.

952
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,520
Right! That's too much!

953
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,920
Straight.
The main road's up ahead.

954
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,440
- Any cars?
- No. 20 meters.

955
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,240
Ten meters. Now, to the right.

956
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,840
No,
that was too much to the right!

957
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,280
What are you doing?

958
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:04,520
You're shit at this.
I drive through contact.

959
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,440
Blind people feel
their way around things.

960
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,360
You're destroying the bus!

961
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:11,640
Magda, stop the bus now!

962
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:12,880
Stop!

963
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,720
Are you driving like that
because you're blind or drunk?

964
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:23,640
We'll do it the way I said.
You'll drive and I'll steer.

965
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,000
Hey! Wait! Hello!

966
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,960
So, the border's up ahead.

967
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,880
- Would you take off your blind badge?
- Yes.

968
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,400
Rainman, no more talking
from now on, okay?

969
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:52,840
- Yes.
- Not a word.

970
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,360
- Not a word.
- From now on.

971
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,280
- Yes. Are we good?
- Yes.

972
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,480
Yes. Not a word. We're good.

973
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,720
You're on your own
for the last stretch. I'll guide you.

974
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,920
Yes.

975
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,960
- Yes, we can do it.
- No! Grab it!

976
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,960
- What? Your thumb?
- Yes. It's a joystick.

977
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,880
You steer the thumb,
I'll steer the bus.

978
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:18,160
- Keep your eyes on the road!
- Why? I can't see anyway.

979
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,280
But they don't need to know that!

980
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,760
Chill!
They won't check a disabled bus.

981
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,640
Could you turn off the engine?

982
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,720
Wind down the window.

983
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,760
- Could you wind down the window?
- Okay! Okay!

984
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,680
- Good day.
- I'd like to see your license, please.

985
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,720
- Yes!
- Have you been drinking?

986
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,600
- You're asking if I've been drinking?
- Yes.

987
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,800
Yes, but not for a while.

988
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,000
- How long ago was that then?
- A long time ago. Months ago.

989
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:17,640
But aren't you just meant to ask
if we have something to declare?

990
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,160
- Anything to declare?
- No, nothing.

991
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,600
- License, please.
- Yes, of course.

992
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:29,040
- Oh, shit!
- Yes?

993
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,480
I'm afraid I left it at the center.

994
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,440
You have no idea what it's like
looking after so many disabled people.

995
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,640
- So much stress!
- Registration then, please.

996
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,280
Yes, of course.

997
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,240
Just a moment.

998
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:46,520
- I'll get it.
- My colleague will get it.

999
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,760
What happened to the side mirror?

1000
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:53,560
The right side mirror
is not mandatory.

1001
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,360
Check in your handbook.

1002
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,240
Yep. Here it is.

1003
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,000
Here.

1004
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,160
So, we've got it. Got it. Got it.

1005
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,640
I'm gay.

1006
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,880
Magda is blind.

1007
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:16,800
- Who's Magda?
- Oh, Rainman...

1008
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,480
No surprise, seeing how she drives.

1009
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,720
- So... Busy day?
- Are you nuts?

1010
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:25,760
- Busy?
- Are you two the carers?

1011
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,240
- Yes, exactly.
- Got your carer IDs?

1012
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,840
- We have nothing to declare, so why...
- Step outside.

1013
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,520
So, you mean...
You want me to step outside?

1014
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:40,920
What else?

1015
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:46,160
Wouldn't you rather come in?
It's much more comfortable in here.

1016
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,160
- Step outside.
- He can't walk.

1017
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:53,080
- True. I can't. I'm a paraplegic.
- I thought you were the carer.

1018
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,920
Yes, I am. It's a new concept

1019
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,760
called "Disabled... People
with disabilities for each other".

1020
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,720
The inclusion of wheelchair users
in patient care professions.

1021
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,120
By the disabled. For the disabled.

1022
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,560
But my colleague Magda can walk.

1023
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,480
- She can get out if you want her to.
- Help! Help me!

1024
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,880
Release me!

1025
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,240
Eddy, behave yourself
in front of the officers.

1026
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,240
- I'm being maltreated!
- Shut it!

1027
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,200
I'm being abused!

1028
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,480
See what happens when he's stressed?
Can we go now?

1029
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,120
What's wrong with him?

1030
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,600
- He's...
- Hello? Help me!

1031
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,760
- Classic disability.
- Yes, just a classic disability.

1032
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,840
If you don't have any papers,
we'll call the police...

1033
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,360
Listen up, Mr... Mr...
You never told us your name.

1034
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,360
- My name's right here.
- Yeah! But how do you pronounce it?

1035
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:46,720
- "Müller?"
- Listen up, customs officer Müller!

1036
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,280
Isn't the registration enough for you?

1037
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,160
- Well...
- Why do you torture us?

1038
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:54,400
We'll call the Federal Police.
Torsten, call Norbert.

1039
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,680
- I'm being abused!
- Tell him to send someone over.

1040
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,840
Hey. Over here. I can help.

1041
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,800
- I can help.
- And you are?

1042
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:06,840
I'm the carer. The head carer.

1043
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,040
- I can explain everything.
- ID?

1044
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,800
Yes. Yes, of course.

1045
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:15,640
Hey.

1046
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,760
- Help! Laura, help!
- Here.

1047
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,400
Laura. Help me, Laura!

1048
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:25,320
But please hurry, because if he doesn't
get his meds in the next 20 minutes,

1049
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,560
I'll blame you for his head injuries.

1050
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:29,760
Help!

1051
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,040
Hey! Hello?

1052
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:37,760
- Thank you.
- Help me! Help!

1053
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,160
Everything's fine.
You need to get your mirror replaced.

1054
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,000
- You're free to go.
- Thank you so much.

1055
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,560
Can't you see
what they've done to me? Please!

1056
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,640
Laura!

1057
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:04,120
- Well, shall I drive, or...
- Shut up!

1058
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,120
Why the hell was Magda
at the wheel?

1059
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,280
Rainman didn't want to drive anymore.

1060
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:23,920
Rainman was driving?
Are you kidding me?

1061
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:27,640
Are you nuts? I'm still in
my fucking probation period!

1062
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,400
Why is the bus in this state?

1063
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,080
And why aren't you in your wheelchair?

1064
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:35,680
And why do you look like Puff Daddy?

1065
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,960
They tied me up and beat me up.

1066
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:39,880
Shut up!

1067
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:43,080
Why does Franzi
look like a sex worker and Michi...

1068
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,240
Where's Michi?

1069
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,760
Shut up!

1070
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,520
Magda, I told you to keep
an eye on him!

1071
01:16:55,680 --> 01:16:59,080
How could I have done that too?
I was driving the bus!

1072
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,320
- Fuck. Fuck!
- You asked Magda to keep an eye on him?

1073
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,720
- Fuck, fuck, fuck!
- Where did you last see him?

1074
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:08,280
I don't know. They nearly killed me.

1075
01:17:08,520 --> 01:17:10,680
- He's got all the money.
- What? Who?

1076
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:13,720
Michi. I think
he was on the field with us.

1077
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,320
What field?

1078
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,800
Oh, man!
Where we had the accident.

1079
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,200
This is just shit!

1080
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,840
Michi!

1081
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,400
Michi!

1082
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:51,560
Michi!

1083
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,960
Michi!

1084
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,720
He can't be far.

1085
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,360
Michi!

1086
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,520
We'll find him. I promise.

1087
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,920
You only want to find Michi
because your money's stuck to him.

1088
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,280
Michi!

1089
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,320
Believe me.
I want to find Michi as much as you do.

1090
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,000
It's not about the money.

1091
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:22,320
Hey! Hello? Could you untie me please?

1092
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,160
Could you please untie me?

1093
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,240
I'm calling the police.

1094
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,600
Hey, thanks for helping us
at the border.

1095
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,880
I didn't do it for you.

1096
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,960
- Emergency call center.
- Hello.

1097
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:55,040
I'd like to report a missing person.
His name is Michi Wolter.

1098
01:18:58,440 --> 01:19:00,120
I'm his carer.

1099
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:07,000
We last saw him about an hour ago.

1100
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,520
- What?
- I know where he is.

1101
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:23,800
I know where he is!

1102
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:47,200
Sorry! We're way more disabled
than you are.

1103
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,160
Let's go!

1104
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,840
- Hello. We have to get in.
- How many?

1105
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,560
- What?
- How many are you?

1106
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,480
- Seven. No! Six.
- 50,000.

1107
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,680
- Four. Four.
- Well?

1108
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,120
- Four.
- Including the wheelchair user?

1109
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,400
- Yes. Why?
- He gets in for free.

1110
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,680
- Okay. Then three.
- Have they got something too?

1111
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,600
We just need the tickets, please.
We don't want a discount.

1112
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,200
As you wish.

1113
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,600
As their carer,
you also get a discount.

1114
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:16,680
Okay. Whatever!

1115
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,680
- Please! No more discounts.
- 105 Francs.

1116
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,240
- 105 Francs!
- Do you take euros?

1117
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,520
Yeah?

1118
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:25,600
No smaller bills?

1119
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,560
Oh, God! Take my card.

1120
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,760
The connection's really bad here.

1121
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,160
Okay, let's go! Let's go!

1122
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,400
Rainman, we're looking for Michi.
He must be here somewhere.

1123
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:26,920
- Michi was on TV.
- What?

1124
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:30,000
- Michi was on TV.
- What?

1125
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:35,520
- It really is him.
- When was that picture taken?

1126
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:39,920
About 15 minutes ago.
Do you want a copy?

1127
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,800
Let's split up.

1128
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:47,000
Rainman, you stay here and hand out
his picture. What's your name?

1129
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,080
- Gökhan.
- Can you look after Rainman?

1130
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,160
- Sure.
- Is that okay?

1131
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,960
Let's do that. We're good.

1132
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,560
Mom, what's he doing there?

1133
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,080
He's disabled, darling.

1134
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,240
Have you seen this man? He's missing.

1135
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,960
Excuse me.
Have you seen this man? The one with...

1136
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,600
- Are you gay?
- Yes, I'm gay.

1137
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,320
Me too.

1138
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,240
- You can't ride on your own.
- Why not?

1139
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:52,880
Safety regulations.

1140
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,560
Is anyone here alone? Hello?

1141
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:03,880
Rad.

1142
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:05,720
Rad.

1143
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,280
Careful!

1144
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:26,640
- Look!
- Where did you get that?

1145
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,400
I know where he is!

1146
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,800
Out of the way!

1147
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,000
Careful! Out of the way!

1148
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,800
Out of the way!

1149
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,200
Michi! Michi!

1150
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,120
And, we're off.

1151
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:50,240
Let me through!

1152
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,600
Michi!

1153
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,520
Come on.

1154
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:32,880
So? What...

1155
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,320
What did she say?

1156
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:51,440
Don't worry. I didn't tell on you.

1157
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:57,440
Laura, I'm...

1158
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,200
I'm so sorry.

1159
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,600
Take care, Oliver.

1160
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:54,600
Do you like your cheesecake?

1161
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,080
Thank you.

1162
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,240
It's delicious.

1163
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,240
You haven't even tried it.

1164
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,240
Very good. Well done.

1165
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:52,760
Okay, those of you who are up
are free to go.

1166
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:58,920
- Oliver?
- I'm fine. I'll go in a bit.

1167
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:02,840
- You can't just...
- I just want to lay here a while.

1168
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:06,520
Okay.

1169
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,560
- Did we wake you?
- What are you doing here?

1170
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,720
What a warm welcome.

1171
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:42,000
We wanted to check you're still alive.
Long time no see.

1172
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:45,000
- I haven't needed any Wi-Fi.
- Shame. Real shame.

1173
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:47,840
- Did we do something wrong?
- What do you want?

1174
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:49,840
- Let's take him with us.
- Yes.

1175
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,120
No, Franzi.
Please, just leave me here.

1176
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:55,640
- What's that smell?
- My coat.

1177
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:58,800
- Ever heard of dry cleaning?
- Help me, Magda.

1178
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,800
Wait.
You have to lock the brake first.

1179
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,760
- Break it.
- No, brake.

1180
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:06,760
God, you're heavy.

1181
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,800
Well done.
I'm so proud, you know.

1182
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:14,400
- Not so fast, Franzi.
- Yes!

1183
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,400
Like this?

1184
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:25,280
An excellent driver.
Now I need make-up. I'm so chic.

1185
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,520
SEX IN A WHEELCHAIR

1186
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:43,800
- Is it a bad time?
- No. It's okay.

1187
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:48,560
There's a parcel for you.
It was just delivered.

1188
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,000
Shall I open it for you?

1189
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,800
Thank you, Eddy.

1190
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:56,960
What could it be?

1191
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:09,440
- Did you get the whisky?
- Yes, thank you. Here it is. Thank you.

1192
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,440
I'm sorry I haven't
been able to visit you yet.

1193
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:21,160
I've been meaning
to visit you for a while now.

1194
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,760
It's okay.

1195
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:27,040
As for your new contract, I'd like
to give you your own department.

1196
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:31,520
You can choose your own team.
Julius' people are also available.

1197
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,880
What about Julius?

1198
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,880
Julius no longer works for us.
I think you know why.

1199
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,920
I'll send you a draft contract.

1200
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:45,440
When you're back, we'll do something
about the stairs at the entrance.

1201
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:53,960
- Are you even allowed to drink whisky?
- Sure. Why shouldn't I be?

1202
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:58,320
- Due to your situation.
- No, I can drink whisky.

1203
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,040
- Excuse me?
- I can drink whisky. Sure.

1204
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,160
The connection...

1205
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:05,240
I can't hear...

1206
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,600
RECONNECT

1207
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:31,280
What's that?

1208
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,920
This, dear Magda,
is an excellent single malt.

1209
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:38,880
Magda.

1210
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:42,600
- Franzi?
- Nope.

1211
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:47,560
- Quickly, before Eddy comes. Cheers.
- Cheers.

1212
01:33:56,240 --> 01:33:59,080
Tell me, Magda.

1213
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:02,720
So, you and... Eddy.

1214
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,840
You two had some sort of...

1215
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,120
- Don't ask!
- Can I tell him?

1216
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,000
- Go on.
- Wednesday.

1217
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,480
- They had sex.
- Nonsense!

1218
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:14,440
- Everyone knows.
- That's enough, now!

1219
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,280
When will Laura be back?

1220
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,440
- She won't be back.
- Why not?

1221
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,480
- Laura was fired, Franzi.
- By whom?

1222
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:29,440
- Ms. Zschetzsche.
- But she didn't do anything wrong.

1223
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:32,240
- I know. It wasn't her fault.
- So, tell her!

1224
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:33,560
- Whom?
- Ms. Zenetzsche.

1225
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,400
- What?
- That it's our fault.

1226
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:39,120
No, it wasn't our fault.
It was my fault. It was my plan.

1227
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,240
You wouldn't have
come up with it without me.

1228
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,800
- It's my fault.
- Franzi, it really wasn't your fault.

1229
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:49,520
- But I want it to be.
- Whatever. It was also your fault.

1230
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,120
- So go tell her.
- Tell whom?

1231
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:53,320
- Ms. Zenetsche.
- Tell her what?

1232
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:55,080
That it was all my fault.

1233
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:04,280
Ms. Zschetzsche,
the whole camel therapy thing was...

1234
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:16,040
Okay.

1235
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:21,200
Yeah.
I bet you're wondering why...

1236
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,080
What is it?

1237
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,360
But he was an excellent...

1238
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,600
- Eddy told me everything.
- Everything?

1239
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,720
Yes.
That's why he got Monday off.

1240
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,400
Great.

1241
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:45,080
But you should know that Laura
had nothing to do with this.

1242
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,200
Laura... Yeah,
I think she really likes you.

1243
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:52,720
She told me a cute story about
how the bus ended up the way it did.

1244
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,960
About how she had to swerve,
because there was a fox on the road.

1245
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,040
I think you were the fox.

1246
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,080
Yeah, well...
As I said, I'm really sorry.

1247
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,440
Oliver...

1248
01:36:08,120 --> 01:36:11,640
- This center was built to help people.
- Yes. Exactly...

1249
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:15,160
You also know
it belongs to a charitable foundation.

1250
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:16,560
Yes, and as I...

1251
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:20,680
And you know that a charitable
foundation can accept donations.

1252
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:23,840
- Yes.
- Even anonymous donations.

1253
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,040
Including anonymous cash donations.
Still with me?

1254
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:30,560
Yeah...
But I'm not quite sure I follow.

1255
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:35,000
Know many people who stash their
money abroad and who want it back?

1256
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:38,800
- More or less?
- I've been in finance for ten years.

1257
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,520
That's great!

1258
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,920
Let's say we were to transport
illegal money over the border

1259
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:49,200
in return for a commission, what would
a reasonable commission fee be?

1260
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,320
20, 30%?

1261
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:56,400
- See this grant application form?
- Yes.

1262
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:03,600
- Now you don't.
- You're suggesting, Ms. Zschetzsche...

1263
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:04,800
- Ingeborg.
- What?

1264
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,760
- Call me Ingeborg.
- Ingeborg.

1265
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,640
- Not you, Rainer!
- Real shame.

1266
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,800
Ingeborg, you're saying you want
the center to offer smuggling trips

1267
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,880
for tax fraudsters
and get paid in commission?

1268
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,360
Yes.

1269
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,480
Okay. But on one condition.

1270
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:23,680
- Which is?
- Rehire Laura.

1271
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:26,880
- It's not like I fired her, you know.
- You didn't?

1272
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:28,960
Of course not. She quit.

1273
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,840
Welcome to Burger King.
Your order, please.

1274
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,240
Laura, we need to talk.

1275
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:45,960
Your order, please...

1276
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:49,040
I'd like to talk to you.
Could you come out?

1277
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,320
No. Just say it.

1278
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:55,560
- Why did you tell Ingeborg you quit?
- Who's Ingeborg?

1279
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:59,760
I mean Ms. Zschetzsche.
Why did you leave the job?

1280
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,240
Are you here to quote
Reinhold Messner again?

1281
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:07,960
You said it was your dream job.

1282
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:12,400
- Well, I was wrong.
- No! No! Why do you say that?

1283
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,240
- Because I screwed up.
- No!

1284
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,400
- Yes! I was a shitty carer.
- No!

1285
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:18,320
- Please, Laura!
- No!

1286
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:22,320
That's bullshit.
You're a fantastic carer.

1287
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,920
Franzi asks about you every day.

1288
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:28,320
This wouldn't have happened
if I wasn't a complete idiot.

1289
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,040
- Excuse me!
- What?

1290
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,600
- Need any help?
- No, I'm talking here.

1291
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:36,960
- How long will it take?
- As long as it takes, okay? Got it?

1292
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,320
Laura, listen to me.

1293
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:46,280
"If you fight, you might lose,

1294
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:49,320
if you don't, you have already lost."

1295
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,400
I don't remember who said that.

1296
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:54,200
Bertolt Brecht.

1297
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:56,800
You must order now.

1298
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,040
Yeah. Yes, I know.

1299
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,880
I don't know...

1300
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:06,200
- Fries. Six fries. With ketchup.
- Small, large, medium?

1301
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:09,560
Large. And a Fanta, please.

1302
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:26,280
19.53, please!

1303
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:49,600
Is the Fanta for Franzi?

1304
01:40:00,520 --> 01:40:02,520
Welcome to Burger King.
Your order, please.

1305
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,600
Oliver!

1306
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,680
I forgot the ketchup.

1307
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,480
Are you going somewhere?

1308
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:47,600
Luxembourg.

1309
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,120
Luxembourg?

1310
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,840
I see them.

1311
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:54,000
- What are they doing?
- He has to tell her he loves her.

1312
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:57,040
- As if you know about all that.
- I know what love is.

1313
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,360
Love comes from the left.
From the heart.

1314
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,560
I know how sex works.
You want to know?

1315
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:03,240
No, please don't.

1316
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:08,200
Leave the door open. It's so hot.

1317
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:12,920
Come on! I'm sweating
like your mom during a paternity test!

1318
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,320
And you think I want in?

1319
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:25,240
- What's in it for you?
- Nothing.

1320
01:41:25,400 --> 01:41:28,600
Well, okay. We each get a tiny bonus.

1321
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:32,720
Everyone gets the same amount.
And so would you if you came along.

1322
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,520
I want double.

1323
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,840
Impossible. It all goes to the center.
You can't take from that money.

1324
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,800
I want your share. For the last trip.

1325
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:50,760
I'll also take you out for yokitari.
You won't have to pay.

1326
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,360
It's called "yakitori".

1327
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:57,720
Open the door, Eddy!

1328
01:41:58,440 --> 01:42:01,000
Come on. I'm sorry.

1329
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,160
I really am.

1330
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:07,920
There we go.

1331
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:11,680
- Laura!
- Franzi!

1332
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,000
- I missed you so much!
- So did I!

1333
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:15,880
- Like this?
- Yes.

1334
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,840
- I can drink a beer. Yes.
- Michi!

1335
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:29,240
And we're back with traffic
jam updates...

1336
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:32,360
Laura, let me know when you feel tired.

1337
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:36,280
How could you get fries,
but no mayonnaise?

1338
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:38,760
I'm an excellent driver.

1339
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:42,800
- I have to pee.
- I told you not to drink so much Fanta.

1340
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:46,600
Michi.

1341
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:49,440
A promise is a promise.

1342
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:01,880
Eddy, I braided something
for you as an apology.

1343
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,960
- What?
- Your mom's chest hair!

1344
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:19,520
What are you doing?

1345
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:22,080
- We're fine.
- The side mirror fell off!

1346
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:25,640
- What a shame. Yes.
- Should we drive? I want fries.

1347
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:29,520
- Rainman, pass the bag along.
- Are we good? We're good.

1348
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:39,120
THE GOLDFISH
