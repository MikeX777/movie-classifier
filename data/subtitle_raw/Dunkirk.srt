- It's impossible.
- Too shallow?

143
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,330
Because anything that drafts
over three feet can't get near.

144
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:16,492
We don't have enough small boats
to ferry men to the destroyers.

Can't risk it.

All right, keep letting me know.

166
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,539
My gauge took a bit of
a knock back there.

167
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,636

168

No, no.

169

He feels safer on deck.

183
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,081
You would too if
you'd been bombed.

184
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:45,255
U-boat.

185
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,756
It was a U-boat.

186
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,995
Get him some more tea, George.

187
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:12,278
Right, we're about
five minutes out,

188
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,111
so climb to 2,000. Over.

189
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,411
That's more fuel.

190
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,077
I know, but I don't want
to get jumped again.

191
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,288
Let's get a decent altitude.

192
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:20,390
We can dive down on the
bastards from above. Over.

193
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,048
Understood. Angels two.

194
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:23,227
Over.

195
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,730
Right, Highlanders.

196
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,857
Let's find you another ship.

197
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:41,972
Come on.

198
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,536
Everyone else, keep climbing.
Climb on the deck.

199
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,842
Climb on the deck.

200
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,374
Watch your heads on
the rail. Watch it.

201
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,950
That's right, keep going
down. Take a blanket.

202
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,255
Down you go. Put this on, my love.

203
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,890
Down you go. Keep going down.

204
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,187
There's a nice cup of
tea for you down there.

205
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,362
Keep moving down.

206
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,191
Take a blanket.

207
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,399
Try and make some room.

208
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,000
Keep moving down, boys.

209
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,395
This way.

210
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,131
A cup of tea down there.

211
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,800
There you go. Down
there. Move down there.

212
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,521
What's wrong with your friend?

213
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,103
He's looking for a quick way out.

214
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:28,944
In case we go down.

215
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,918
Where are we going?

216
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,577
Dunkirk.

217
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:14,682
No, no, no, we're
going to England.

218
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:18,418
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

219
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:21,761
Look, I'm not going back.

220
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,691
I'm not going back.

221
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:26,967
Look at it.

222
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,833
If we go there, we'll die.

223
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,015
I see your point, son.

224
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,976
Well, let's plot a course.

225
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,984
You can take your tea
below and warm up.

226
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,154
Peter, have we got space
for a man to lie down?

227
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,695
Yeah.

228
00:33:59,103 --> 00:34:00,502
Here, come on.

229
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,877
Careful.

230
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:10,473
Careful.

231
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,083
Just in there.

232
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:20,323
I'll get you some more tea.

233
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,599
Is he a coward, Mr Dawson?

234
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,403
He's shell-shocked, George.

235
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,136
He's not himself.

236
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,282
He may never be himself again.

237
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,054
Here you are.

238
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,546
40 gallons, Fortis 1.

239
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:19,174
40 gallons, understood.

240
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:24,821
Heinkel, 11 o'clock.

241
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,157
She's lining up to drop her
load on that minesweeper.

242
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,326
Fighters?

243
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,962
Yeah, 109s off her starboard.

244
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,497
I'm on the bomber.

245
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,317
Got him. Got him.

246
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:01,447
Oh, she's turning. You
must've damaged her.

247
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,046
Where's the escort?

248
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,381
Well, I got one of...

249
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,056
Jesus.

250
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,103
I'm going down.

251
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:27,835
I'm on him. Bail out.

252
00:37:48,032 --> 00:37:49,431
No, the swell looks
good. I'm ditching.

253
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:11,649
Don't leave us.

254
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,148
Come back.

255
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,217
- Wait for us.
- Help. Help us.

256
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:23,465
Pick us up. Pick us up.

257
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:28,638
Come back.

258
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:31,602
Torpedo.

259
00:39:02,873 --> 00:39:06,832
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

260
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:54,578
Help.

261
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,413
Get us out of here.

262
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,432
Spitfires, George.

263
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:14,935
Greatest plane ever built.

264
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:19,776
You didn't even look.

265
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,113
Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.

266
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:27,145
Sweetest sound you
could hear out here.

267
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:28,952
Hello?

268
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,612
Could you open the door?

269
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,314
Hello? Can you hear me?

270
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,158
Open the door.

271
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,961
Do you hear me?

272
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:43,596
He wants to come out.

273
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:45,758
What have you done? Locked him in?

274
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,426
Let him out, for God's sake.

275
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:48,605
Hello?

276
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,202
Let me out.

277
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,192
You haven't turned around.

278
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:13,558
No. We have a job to do.

279
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,193
Job? This is a pleasure yacht.

280
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:21,066
You're weekend sailors,
not the bloody navy.

281
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,366
A man your age?

282
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,309
Men my age dictate this war.

283
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:29,173
Why should we be allowed to
send our children to fight it?

284
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,109
You should be at home.

285
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:32,963
Well, there won't
be any home if we

286
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:34,844
allow a slaughter
across the Channel.

287
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,519
He's turning tail. I'm
gonna get after him.

288
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:46,529
Good luck.

289
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,689
Watch your fuel.
You're at 15 gallons.

290
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:53,769
15 gallons, understood.

291
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:57,431
Best of luck, Collins.

292
00:43:00,511 --> 00:43:02,672
Collins, do you read?

293
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,636
Oi. No. No.

294
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,505
Get off. Get off.

295
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,910
Piss off, the both of
you. It's too crowded.

296
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,309
You can't leave us.

297
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:14,442
Make some room.

298
00:44:14,618 --> 00:44:15,618
No.

299
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,817
No. Get off.

300
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,422
You men, leave off.
You'll capsize the boat.

301
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,684
She's gone over twice
on the way out here.

302
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,459
You have to stay calm.
There are plenty of boats.

303
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,661
Calm?

304
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,092
Wait till you get torpedoed,
then tell us to be calm.

305
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:28,928
You have life jackets?

306
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,396
Yes, they do.

307
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:32,535
Don't panic, boys. The
water's not too rough

308
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:33,795
or too cold.

309
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,495
We're heading back to the beach.

310
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,937
- Let's go to Dover.
- Yeah.

311
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,337
We can't make it across the
Channel in this, lads.

312
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,969
We need to get back to the beach
and wait for another ride.

313
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:47,112
You men in the water, float
here, save your strength.

314
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:48,808
We'll come back for you.

315
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:49,986
Oars in.

316
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,817
Together, pull.

317
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:57,356
Together, pull.

318
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,697
Pull.

319
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,893
Together, pull.

320
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:07,160
Pull.

321
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,207
Together, pull.

322
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,640
There's no hiding from this, son.

323
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,578
What is it you think you can
do out there, on this thing?

324
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:24,913
There's not just us.
A call went out.

325
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:27,148
We aren't the only ones
to answer, you know.

326
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,985
You don't even have guns.

327
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,359
Do you have a gun?

328
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:33,257
Yes, of course. A rifle, a 303.

329
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,456
Did it help you against the
dive bombers and the U-boats?

330
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,362
You're an old fool.

331
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,402
I'm not going back.

332
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,234
I'm not going back.

333
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:45,942
Turn it around.

334
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,443
I'm not turning round.

335
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,273
Turn it around.

336
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,243
Turn it...

337
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,719
- Calm it down, mate.
- Turn it around.

338
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:57,887
Wait, wait.

339
00:45:58,055 --> 00:45:59,454
Calm it down, mate.

340
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:01,924
George?

341
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
George.

342
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:07,563
What have you done?

343
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,733
Okay, you're all right, George.

344
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:12,628
You're all right.

345
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,362
Hang on. Okay. Okay, just...

346
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,031
That's it. That's good enough.

347
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:21,109
It's gonna keep some
pressure on. There we go.

348
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,870
There we go.

349
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,274
Can you hear me, George?

350
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:00,325
Come on, lads.

351
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,438
Come on. Come on, boys.

352
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,093
It's a pier.

353
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:13,760
For when the water comes in.

354
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:19,706
The tide's turning now.

355
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:22,778
How can you tell?

356
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,715
The bodies come back.

357
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:58,547
Hey.

358
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,555
Hey, Highlanders.

359
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,133
Hey, Highlanders.

360
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,501
What's that way?

361
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:27,009
A boat.

362
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,110
She's grounded.

363
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,971
Not when the tide
comes in, she's not.

364
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:50,859
Be a brave lad.

365
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:54,870
You and Mr Dawson?

366
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:58,201
It's the best thing
I've ever done.

367
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,542
You're all right. You're okay.

368
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:15,113
Sea Cadet. It's the only
thing I've ever done.

369
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,419
It's all right. It's okay.
Just have some water.

370
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,958
I told my dad...

371
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,293
I've done nothing at school

372
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:28,364
and that I would do
something one day.

373
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,642
Maybe get in the local paper.

374
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,072
Maybe my teachers would see it.

375
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,804
Okay, get some rest.

376
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:40,973
I need you back up on deck
as soon as you're able.

377
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,252
I can't.

378
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:45,511
What?

379
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,757
I can't see.

380
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:51,687
Sir.

381
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,490
The French have been forced
back on the western side.

382
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:57,757
They're still holding a perimeter?

383
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:58,927
For now.

384
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:02,556
Officer coming through. Move
yourselves. Move yourselves.

385
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:14,907
Where are the destroyers?

386
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:16,602
There'll be one soon.

387
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:20,716
One?

388
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,444
After yesterday's losses, it's
one ship on the mole at a time.

389
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,678
The battle is here.

390
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:26,344
What the hell are
they saving them for?

391
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:27,990
The next battle.

392
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,625
The one for Britain.

393
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,727
It's the same with the planes.

394
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,490
But it's right there.

395
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,199
You can practically...

396
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,426
Seeing home doesn't help
us get there, Colonel.

397
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,536
They need to send more ships.

398
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,030
Every hour the enemy
pushes closer.

399
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,865
They've activated the
small vessels pool.

400
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:48,844
Small vessels?

401
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:51,480
It's the list of civilian
boats for requisition.

402
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:52,981
Civilian?

403
00:55:54,818 --> 00:55:56,547
We need destroyers.

404
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,483
Small boats can load
from the beach.

405
00:55:58,655 --> 00:55:59,883
Not in these conditions.

406
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,547
Well, I'd rather face
waves than dive bombers.

407
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,292
No, you're right. They
won't get up in this.

408
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:12,396
The Royal Engineers are
building piers from lorries.

409
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,197
At least that should help us
when the tide comes back.

410
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,533
Well, we'll know in
six hours' time.

411
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,974
I thought the tides
were every three?

412
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:24,576
Then it's good that you're
army and I'm navy, isn't it?

413
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,347
There. Vanquisher.

414
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,360
Where's the crew?

415
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:46,399
Probably got spooked
after they ran aground.

416
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:48,727
Scarpered up the beach.

417
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:50,205
Why?

418
00:56:50,373 --> 00:56:52,193
Because we're outside
the perimeter.

419
00:56:52,194 --> 00:56:53,570
Enemy could be right there.

420
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,178
All right, best shut
ourselves inside, boys.

421
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,347
Wait for the high tide.

422
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,073
How long's that?

423
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,877
Every three hours.

424
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,535
I've put a bit of pressure on it.

425
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,644
Strapped him up, made
him comfortable.

426
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:31,938
What?

427
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,250
It's bad, Dad.

428
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:39,744
Well, should we turn back?

429
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,129
We've come so far.

430
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:49,988
Dad, is that one of ours?

431
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:54,833
That's a Heinkel. They'll go
for that minesweeper there.

432
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:57,101
Hang on. Shouldn't we stand
by to pick up survivors?

433
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,172
To do that we have to
survive ourselves.

434
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:06,108
Poke your head out. See
if the water's come in.

435
00:58:11,586 --> 00:58:13,053
Talkative sod, aren't you?

436
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:40,978
It's barely come in at all.

437
00:58:41,149 --> 00:58:43,310
- Fuck's sake.
- Calm down.

438
00:58:43,485 --> 00:58:45,646
What goes out comes
back in again, right?

439
00:58:45,821 --> 00:58:47,220
Yeah, but how long?

440
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:04,839
Spitfires.

441
00:59:05,707 --> 00:59:06,731
Come on.

442
00:59:13,382 --> 00:59:14,406
Come on, come on.

443
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:24,522
Dad, he got him.

444
00:59:24,693 --> 00:59:26,251
Yeah. Yeah.

445
00:59:33,602 --> 00:59:35,126
The Heinkel's moving off.

446
00:59:40,275 --> 00:59:41,275
Yeah.

447
00:59:42,911 --> 00:59:43,911
Oh, no.

448
00:59:45,881 --> 00:59:47,678
Smoke from the Spitfire.

449
00:59:49,017 --> 00:59:50,848
Watch for a parachute.

450
00:59:57,692 --> 00:59:58,692
Oi.

451
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:05,359
Oi. Oi.

452
01:00:51,379 --> 01:00:52,744
Are you German?

453
01:00:52,914 --> 01:00:54,245
No, Dutch. Dutch.

454
01:00:55,617 --> 01:00:56,617
Merchant navy.

455
01:00:57,452 --> 01:00:58,942
Here to pick you up. To help you.

456
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,781
Why'd you leave your boat?

457
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:02,184
In case the Germans come.

458
01:01:02,824 --> 01:01:04,917
We wait up the beach.

459
01:01:05,093 --> 01:01:06,685
With the soldiers.
Wait for the tide.

460
01:01:06,862 --> 01:01:09,160
You came back. The
tide must be in.

461
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:12,027
Coming. Coming, yes.

462
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:14,366
But more hours till we float.

463
01:01:14,669 --> 01:01:15,669
Hours?

464
01:01:15,837 --> 01:01:17,304
Why'd you come back?

465
01:01:19,207 --> 01:01:20,367
Not so heavy when I left.

466
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:35,213
No 'chute.

467
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:41,295
Best of luck, Collins.

468
01:01:46,835 --> 01:01:48,700
Collins, do you read?

469
01:02:14,829 --> 01:02:15,853
He's down.

470
01:02:58,974 --> 01:02:59,974
Dad.

471
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:01,369
Dad, watch the engine.

472
01:03:02,243 --> 01:03:04,677
Dad, he's down. There
was no 'chute.

473
01:03:08,984 --> 01:03:10,315
Dad, come on. There was no 'chute.

474
01:03:11,319 --> 01:03:12,319
He's probably dead.

475
01:03:12,487 --> 01:03:14,648
Damn it, I hear you,
Peter. I hear you.

476
01:03:17,993 --> 01:03:19,688
He may be alive. Maybe.

477
01:03:21,763 --> 01:03:23,594
We may be able to help him.

478
01:04:17,185 --> 01:04:19,449
No. Then they'll
know we're in here.

479
01:04:19,621 --> 01:04:21,111
Why else are they shooting at us?

480
01:04:21,623 --> 01:04:23,147
Look at the grouping.

481
01:04:26,995 --> 01:04:28,462
Target practise.

482
01:05:29,691 --> 01:05:33,092
Go. Plug it. Go, go.

483
01:05:53,314 --> 01:05:54,611
We have to plug it.

484
01:05:54,783 --> 01:05:56,444
After you, mate.

485
01:06:18,506 --> 01:06:19,996
You ready? Go.

486
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:27,170
How do we get off? Do we
need to ditch some ballast?

487
01:06:27,615 --> 01:06:29,412
Weight. Do we need to lose weight?

488
01:06:29,584 --> 01:06:31,313
Weight. Weight, yes.

489
01:06:31,486 --> 01:06:32,817
Yes.

490
01:06:32,987 --> 01:06:34,352
Somebody needs to get off.

491
01:06:35,423 --> 01:06:36,822
Well volunteered.

492
01:06:36,991 --> 01:06:38,515
We don't need a volunteer.

493
01:06:38,993 --> 01:06:40,620
I know someone who
ought to get off.

494
01:06:43,064 --> 01:06:44,064
This one.

495
01:06:45,433 --> 01:06:46,695
He's a German spy.

496
01:06:46,868 --> 01:06:48,267
Don't be daft.

497
01:06:48,436 --> 01:06:49,960
He's a fucking Jerry.

498
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:52,932
Have you noticed he
hasn't said a word?

499
01:06:54,642 --> 01:06:55,802
Because I have.

500
01:06:56,678 --> 01:06:57,678
He don't speak English.

501
01:06:57,846 --> 01:06:59,588
If he does it's with
an accent that's

502
01:06:59,589 --> 01:07:01,009
thicker than sauerkraut sauce.

503
01:07:01,182 --> 01:07:02,877
You're daft. Tell him.

504
01:07:03,451 --> 01:07:04,645
Yeah.

505
01:07:08,022 --> 01:07:10,456
Tell me.

506
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:36,812
Tell me, Gibson.

507
01:07:44,859 --> 01:07:45,859
Tell me.

508
01:07:46,928 --> 01:07:48,418
Tell him, for God's sake.

509
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:55,134
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

510
01:07:57,272 --> 01:07:58,899
A frog.

511
01:07:59,374 --> 01:08:00,898
A bloody frog.

512
01:08:01,676 --> 01:08:04,736
A cowardly little
queue-jumping frog.

513
01:08:05,413 --> 01:08:06,778
Who's Gibson?

514
01:08:06,948 --> 01:08:09,416
Some naked, dead Englishman
lying out on that sand?

515
01:08:09,584 --> 01:08:11,609
Did you at least have the
decency to bury him?

516
01:08:11,853 --> 01:08:13,582
He did. I helped him. I
thought it was his mate.

517
01:08:13,788 --> 01:08:15,222
- Maybe he killed him.
- He didn't kill him.

518
01:08:15,223 --> 01:08:16,223
How do we know?

519
01:08:16,391 --> 01:08:18,791
How hard is it to find a dead
Englishman on Dunkirk beach?

520
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,222
He didn't kill anyone.

521
01:08:20,395 --> 01:08:22,522
He was just looking for a way off
the sand, like the rest of us.

522
01:08:27,969 --> 01:08:29,698
Haven't they had enough
practise by now?

523
01:08:29,871 --> 01:08:31,862
They're trying to make
sure she won't float.

524
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,530
Will she still float?

525
01:08:33,708 --> 01:08:35,471
Float, yes. Yes, with less weight.

526
01:08:37,145 --> 01:08:38,169
And we know who's getting off.

527
01:08:38,346 --> 01:08:40,473
No, you can't do that. He's
French. He's on our side.

528
01:08:40,648 --> 01:08:42,138
Go on. Up you go.

529
01:08:42,317 --> 01:08:44,581
As soon as he pokes his head
out, they'll slaughter him.

530
01:08:44,752 --> 01:08:45,980
Better him than me.

531
01:08:46,154 --> 01:08:47,314
It's not fair.

532
01:08:47,488 --> 01:08:48,785
Survival's not fair.

533
01:08:48,957 --> 01:08:49,957
No, it's shit.

534
01:08:50,825 --> 01:08:53,157
It's fear, and it's greed.

535
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:55,319
Fate pushed through
the bowels of men.

536
01:08:55,496 --> 01:08:56,496
Shit.

537
01:08:57,999 --> 01:08:59,261
He saved our lives.

538
01:08:59,434 --> 01:09:00,662
And he's about to do it again.

539
01:09:00,835 --> 01:09:01,893
No, don't. Stop.

540
01:09:03,237 --> 01:09:06,604
Somebody's got to get off,
so the rest of us can live.

541
01:09:07,342 --> 01:09:08,366
If you wanna volunteer...

542
01:09:08,576 --> 01:09:09,736
Fuck no.

543
01:09:09,978 --> 01:09:10,978
I'm going home.

544
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:13,306
And if this is the price?

545
01:09:18,286 --> 01:09:19,446
I'll live with it.

546
01:09:20,088 --> 01:09:21,088
But it's wrong.

547
01:09:21,856 --> 01:09:22,856
Go on.

548
01:09:24,959 --> 01:09:26,950
One man's not going to
make enough difference.

549
01:09:27,128 --> 01:09:29,187
You'd best hope it does, because
you'd be volunteering next.

550
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:31,365
What?

551
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:34,134
We're regimental brothers, mate.

552
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:36,134
It's just the way it is.

553
01:09:46,147 --> 01:09:47,512
We float.

554
01:09:48,216 --> 01:09:49,342
We float.

555
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:51,643
Start the bloody engine.

556
01:10:30,024 --> 01:10:31,423
Afternoon.

557
01:11:26,781 --> 01:11:29,147
I'm sorry, son. I
really don't know.

558
01:11:31,819 --> 01:11:33,582
You're right not moving him.

559
01:11:37,158 --> 01:11:38,648
You've done the best
for him you can.

560
01:11:50,771 --> 01:11:51,931
We've wasted the day.

561
01:11:52,106 --> 01:11:54,131
I share your frustration, Colonel.

562
01:11:55,676 --> 01:11:56,676
Johnny.

563
01:12:03,651 --> 01:12:05,585
Grounded trawler, taking fire.

564
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,779
They're breaking through
the dunes to the east.

565
01:12:11,592 --> 01:12:12,991
This is it.

566
01:12:21,102 --> 01:12:22,160
Plug the holes.

567
01:12:22,336 --> 01:12:23,633
With what?

568
01:12:34,549 --> 01:12:36,449
Plug the holes.

569
01:12:38,186 --> 01:12:40,984
Other side. Other side.

570
01:13:30,771 --> 01:13:32,238
What do you see?

571
01:13:39,113 --> 01:13:40,444
Home.

572
01:15:35,029 --> 01:15:37,020
Is he all right? The boy?

573
01:15:39,033 --> 01:15:40,295
No.

574
01:15:40,468 --> 01:15:42,095
No, he's not.

575
01:15:53,547 --> 01:15:54,547
Dad.

576
01:16:02,423 --> 01:16:04,721
Come on. Come on,
Farrier. Come on.

577
01:16:23,711 --> 01:16:25,269
There's men in the water.

578
01:17:10,624 --> 01:17:11,624
Oil.

579
01:17:13,093 --> 01:17:15,584
It's oil. Oil. You're
getting into oil.

580
01:17:51,031 --> 01:17:52,498
Keep coming.

581
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,833
Plenty of room.

582
01:17:59,874 --> 01:18:01,671
All right, below deck.

583
01:18:37,745 --> 01:18:39,645
Abandon ship.

584
01:19:01,902 --> 01:19:04,200
Gibson. Leave it.

585
01:19:47,214 --> 01:19:48,374
Below decks.

586
01:20:37,297 --> 01:20:39,458
Listen, we have to get as many
of you on board as we can

587
01:20:39,633 --> 01:20:40,725
before that oil catches fire.

588
01:20:40,934 --> 01:20:43,528
You go below decks or you get off
my boat. That's your choice.

589
01:20:46,473 --> 01:20:48,202
Keep coming.

590
01:20:49,543 --> 01:20:52,034
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Careful.
Careful down there.

591
01:20:52,212 --> 01:20:53,509
Careful. Careful down there.

592
01:20:55,549 --> 01:20:57,676
He's dead, mate.

593
01:21:02,289 --> 01:21:04,382
So be bloody careful with him.

594
01:21:26,413 --> 01:21:28,074
Will he be okay?

595
01:21:28,849 --> 01:21:29,907
The boy?

596
01:21:35,889 --> 01:21:36,889
Yeah.

597
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:02,404
He's coming back round.

598
01:23:03,277 --> 01:23:04,574
He's coming back round.

599
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:12,350
Come on, Farrier. Come on.

600
01:23:27,601 --> 01:23:28,829
Get off the ship.

601
01:23:45,018 --> 01:23:46,485
Come on, Farrier. Get around them.

602
01:23:46,653 --> 01:23:47,950
Come on, come on.

603
01:24:44,611 --> 01:24:45,611
Go.

604
01:24:50,117 --> 01:24:51,117
Go. Go. Go.

605
01:25:05,532 --> 01:25:06,590
Go.

606
01:25:40,367 --> 01:25:41,367
Easy.

607
01:25:46,506 --> 01:25:47,768
Take me home.

608
01:26:45,665 --> 01:26:46,962
Where are you from?

609
01:26:47,868 --> 01:26:49,665
Out of Dartmouth.

610
01:26:49,836 --> 01:26:51,064
Christ.

611
01:26:52,172 --> 01:26:53,503
You from Deal?

612
01:26:53,673 --> 01:26:55,140
I am.

613
01:26:55,308 --> 01:26:57,435
You watch the current
at the mouth.

614
01:26:57,644 --> 01:26:58,644
Aye.

615
01:26:58,812 --> 01:26:59,870
And thank you.

616
01:27:49,696 --> 01:27:50,720
That's a fighter.

617
01:27:50,897 --> 01:27:52,057
Yes, an Me 109.

618
01:27:52,232 --> 01:27:53,893
From the south. Peter,
you take the tiller.

619
01:27:54,401 --> 01:27:56,232
Listen for my instructions.

620
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:58,264
Point her south.

621
01:28:10,917 --> 01:28:11,917
Full speed, Peter.

622
01:28:14,321 --> 01:28:15,788
Keep coming round.

623
01:28:15,956 --> 01:28:17,150
Keep coming.

624
01:28:18,492 --> 01:28:20,219
Before he fires, he's got to drop

625
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:22,155
his nose. I'll give
you the signal.

626
01:28:23,663 --> 01:28:24,891
- Now?
- No, no. Wait.

627
01:28:26,099 --> 01:28:28,124
Wait for him to
commit to his line.

628
01:28:45,352 --> 01:28:46,410
Now.

629
01:29:24,624 --> 01:29:25,624
He's gone.

630
01:29:25,725 --> 01:29:27,056
Yeah, bigger fish to fry.

631
01:29:27,227 --> 01:29:29,127
How'd you know that stuff, anyway?

632
01:29:29,529 --> 01:29:30,723
My son's one of you lot.

633
01:29:31,531 --> 01:29:33,226
I knew he'd see us through.

634
01:29:39,306 --> 01:29:40,306
You're RAF?

635
01:29:42,342 --> 01:29:44,207
No. Not me.

636
01:29:44,377 --> 01:29:47,710
My brother. He flew Hurricanes.

637
01:29:47,881 --> 01:29:49,473
Died third week into the war.

638
01:30:29,723 --> 01:30:31,782
No, stay downstairs, please.

639
01:30:32,425 --> 01:30:34,416
We just wanna see the cliffs.

640
01:30:41,368 --> 01:30:43,268
- Is it Dover?
- No.

641
01:30:43,837 --> 01:30:45,270
That's Dorset.

642
01:30:45,839 --> 01:30:47,397
But it's home.

643
01:30:49,409 --> 01:30:51,843
We let you all down, didn't we?

644
01:31:31,184 --> 01:31:34,051
Christ, how many you got in there?

645
01:31:52,072 --> 01:31:53,699
Make your way to the trains.

646
01:31:55,375 --> 01:31:56,967
Where the hell were you?

647
01:32:04,384 --> 01:32:06,079
They know where you were.

648
01:32:11,358 --> 01:32:12,358
Bye.

649
01:32:32,178 --> 01:32:33,543
Cup of tea?

650
01:32:35,482 --> 01:32:36,847
Cup of tea?

651
01:32:37,684 --> 01:32:40,414
Well done. Well done.

652
01:32:40,854 --> 01:32:41,980
Well done, lads.

653
01:32:42,122 --> 01:32:44,750
Well done. Well done, lads.

654
01:32:45,859 --> 01:32:47,417
Well done.

655
01:32:48,027 --> 01:32:49,688
All we did is survive.

656
01:32:50,363 --> 01:32:51,762
That's enough.

657
01:32:59,539 --> 01:33:00,539
Well done.

658
01:33:01,708 --> 01:33:03,005
Well done.

659
01:33:14,154 --> 01:33:16,622
That old bloke wouldn't
even look us in the eye.

660
01:33:36,976 --> 01:33:38,910
Come on, private.

661
01:33:39,813 --> 01:33:44,409
I know we're officers, but
it's us or the enemy.

662
01:33:45,485 --> 01:33:47,817
So now is not the time
to be particular.

663
01:33:51,458 --> 01:33:54,086
Well, Churchill got his 30,000.

664
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:55,557
And then some.

665
01:33:56,429 --> 01:33:58,488
Almost 300,000.

666
01:34:01,935 --> 01:34:03,163
So far.

667
01:34:04,571 --> 01:34:05,595
So far?

668
01:34:06,139 --> 01:34:07,367
I'm staying.

669
01:34:08,575 --> 01:34:09,940
For the French.

670
01:35:03,563 --> 01:35:04,962
Hey.

671
01:35:05,131 --> 01:35:06,291
Where are we?

672
01:35:06,432 --> 01:35:09,230
Siding. You'll be
pulling in in a minute.

673
01:35:09,402 --> 01:35:10,869
What station?

674
01:35:11,037 --> 01:35:12,527
Woking.

675
01:35:13,172 --> 01:35:14,799
Grab me one of them papers.

676
01:35:15,041 --> 01:35:16,167
Go on.

677
01:35:30,023 --> 01:35:31,422
Can't bear it.

678
01:35:33,259 --> 01:35:34,419
You read it.

679
01:35:35,228 --> 01:35:36,228
Can't bear it?

680
01:35:36,863 --> 01:35:39,058
They'll be spitting
at us in the streets.

681
01:35:40,099 --> 01:35:42,932
If they're not locked up
waiting for the invasion.

682
01:36:29,482 --> 01:36:31,950
"Wars are not won by evacuations."

683
01:36:35,755 --> 01:36:37,086
I can't look.

684
01:36:37,457 --> 01:36:39,448
"But there was a victory
inside this deliverance,

685
01:36:39,626 --> 01:36:41,457
"which should be noted.

686
01:36:48,401 --> 01:36:50,335
"Our thankfulness at

01:36:53,106 --> 01:36:56,667

"We shall defend our island

696
01:38:16,089 --> 01:38:17,089
What?

697
01:38:17,256 --> 01:38:20,350
"We shall defend our island
