1
00:00:18,998 --> 00:00:24,175
One, Two, Three
Start!

2
00:00:50,394 --> 00:00:52,386
Go on!
Go on!

3
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:54,204
Faster! Faster!

4
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:56,304
Uncle John,look at our horse
He's winning!

5
00:00:56,305 --> 00:00:58,217
Fantastic!
Bravo!

6
00:00:59,004 --> 00:01:01,858
He's still first,
Bravo!

7
00:01:04,669 --> 00:01:07,302
He's won
He did it!

8
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:09,320
Congratulations Jane
- Thank you

9
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:11,350
A lesson Donald

10
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,461
We should learn not to bet on
longshots quite so often

11
00:01:13,462 --> 00:01:17,270
With women,you're much luckier

12
00:01:17,305 --> 00:01:18,640
With all except you

13
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:20,542
Sorry Peter,but I'm mad
about your bride to be

14
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:23,463
Then our new family will
require a new doctor

15
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:25,314
Very wise of you,

16
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:28,226
I must warn you that Doctor Wells
writes big bills as amusement

17
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:30,787
Talking of finances,
would you Uncle John?

18
00:01:30,788 --> 00:01:32,389
Oh but of course
- Thank you

19
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:41,470
Hello Peter
- Oh Ted Burke

20
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:43,096
I have to speak to
him for a moment

21
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:44,808
Excuse me dear

22
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:49,971
Do you know, Donald
How come peter is so friendly

23
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:51,661
with the chief inspector
of Scotland yard

24
00:01:51,662 --> 00:01:56,263
No idea, it cant hurt though

25
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:58,432
Having a policeman
for a friend

26
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:00,633
Hello Burke
- Hello Peter

27
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:02,144
Since when did you start
following the horses?

28
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:06,346
Actually I prefer football,
Real Madrid and Birmingham play today

29
00:02:06,347 --> 00:02:08,909
At the moment 6 to 2 favour the Spaniards

30
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,354
But it's not over yet

31
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:13,087
What brings you here then?
- I'm here on business

32
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:15,375
There is a lot of money here
In banknotes

33
00:02:16,414 --> 00:02:19,326
Ah of course
You're on the lookout for that forger

34
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:22,930
In the past week,
a great many five pound notes have turned up

35
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:25,698
watch out you don't get stuck Peter
- Thanks for the tip

36
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:26,699
Quite alright

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,419
What's happening?
Another goal for the Spaniards

38
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:32,711
See you tomorrow?
- I'll be there

39
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:35,710
Your wedding is one thing I'm
not going to miss

40
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:38,791
You're lucky Jane

41
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:41,324
Thank you
- You got top odds, Eighty for Ten

42
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:44,868
I'll try my luck again
- You dreamer

43
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:47,237
Her Majesty
- The Queen

44
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:03,033
Peter, I’m betting on this race,come along
- Not right now

45
00:03:03,034 --> 00:03:07,018
Donald...
I'm not sure I'm doing the right thing

46
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,069
I love Jane
But I don't want to bring her any sorrow

47
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,732
That's a lot of nonsense

48
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:17,058
By tomorrow you're the envy of all London
You're a wonderful couple indeed

49
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:19,074
You're to be envied my friend

50
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:21,407
What is it Jane?

51
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:22,944
You look worried

52
00:03:22,945 --> 00:03:25,150
The lucky bride should be...
- I'm not the lucky bride

53
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:29,633
I don't think I'll go through with it
My love is not enough for him

54
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:33,443
Oh you must stop this Jane
Don't be so foolish dear

55
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:36,076
Before she died,
I promised your mother I'd look after you

56
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:40,165
And now you've found Peter,
Peter is the finest,the best of men

57
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,809
Your Mother would have said...
- Yes,yes of course

58
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,277
Look Jane

59
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:47,823
I'm getting old,I'm not too well

60
00:03:47,824 --> 00:03:49,769
I want to see you happily married

61
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,898
Why does Peter want to marry me?
I can't believe he loves me so

62
00:03:53,899 --> 00:03:56,037
How can you feel that way?

63
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:59,059
He'd never have asked you
to marry him if he didn't love you

64
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,166
Hello Jane
- Hello Basil

65
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:02,854
Mr Leith
- Hello Hale

66
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:05,311
I just wanted to have a look at
the blushing bride here

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,243
Lovely as ever

68
00:04:07,244 --> 00:04:10,470
Listen Jane,why don't you go dancing
with me for the last time

69
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:16,171
Basil.. you're impossible
- No more so than your fiancé, Peter Clifton

70
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,926
I must admit,I never thought you'd marry him

71
00:04:18,927 --> 00:04:21,300
We might have had so much good fun my dear

72
00:04:21,301 --> 00:04:24,985
Never mind your foolishness Hale,
it might not amuse Peter

73
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:25,986
Well..

74
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:31,201
Good day Clifton,I've just made my last
effort to take your fiancé away

75
00:04:31,202 --> 00:04:32,933
It's impossible I'm afraid

76
00:04:32,934 --> 00:04:35,467
Still,I expect an invitation
to attend your wedding

77
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:38,122
Don't count on it Hale!

78
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:41,233
Give up will you Hale
- Give up..

79
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:44,285
Why?
I might hold a trump you know

80
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:46,245
Then play it
Don't talk

81
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,936
All things in good time...
my dear boy

82
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,930
Five pounds on lord Byron
Thanks

83
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:10,396
Come over here,this note is forged
on the reverse side it's stamped

84
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:13,077
Dr Donald Wells

85
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:58,624
This is certainly his poorest job to date
They've been getting progressively worse

86
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:02,443
That hundred dollar note
last year wasn't too bad

87
00:07:02,444 --> 00:07:05,086
Come look at this one

88
00:07:05,778 --> 00:07:08,778
Here, here and here

89
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:14,481
Remarkably careless work, for such an expert
- No doubt he's getting over confident

90
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:16,007
Not very likely

91
00:07:18,462 --> 00:07:21,480
I see you still cant resist
jumping to easy conclusions

92
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:24,901
But your deduction is incorrect Stanley

93
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,714
You see our forger is only a man

94
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:31,146
He has to have some off days, we all do

95
00:07:31,147 --> 00:07:33,554
He has his weaknesses

96
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:34,408
Yes that’s true of course

97
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,844
But how do we explain such
obvious carelessness?

98
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:37,497
Perhaps he's...

99
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,344
And what if this
five pound note isn't his work?

100
00:07:40,345 --> 00:07:44,308
This note is his work as sure as
two and two equals four

101
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:46,159
That I can prove to you

102
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,603
Simply compare this
five pound note with the

103
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:49,827
ten pound note,
he made three years ago

104
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:54,629
It was a fine job, but it revealed
a flaw on the left side

105
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,304
I'll pick it up Stanley

106
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:03,412
The press treat him like a film star

107
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:06,615
Yes, you see the mistakes
on this note are

108
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:09,058
almost identical with that
one of three years ago

109
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:10,561
Conclusive prove its the same man

110
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:13,046
Sorry Stanley, it can hardly
be called conclusive

111
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:16,290
It could very well be coincidence
- I can't accept that Chief Inspector

112
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:21,035
No, I put my bet on my theory
Its his work alright,I'm sure

113
00:08:21,036 --> 00:08:24,142
And if his work is this poor
a clumsy forger is easier to catch

114
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:25,711
And this great forger
could fall into our hands

115
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:27,236
In time Stanley

116
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:29,482
But when a criminal knows
he's made mistakes

117
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:30,946
he becomes savage,
and much more dangerous

118
00:08:30,947 --> 00:08:33,117
It takes over his thinking

119
00:08:33,118 --> 00:08:35,889
And I'm absolutely sure

120
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,506
he would resort to murder if needed

121
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,416
Ah Bert,I'm glad Scotland Yard could be here
- Have no fear Peter

122
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:32,864
The whisky and I agree splendidly

123
00:10:53,356 --> 00:10:58,002
Oh Doctor,do you have a moment to spare?
This is inspector Rouper,my associate

124
00:10:58,003 --> 00:11:02,785
One question he'd like to ask you
- This bank note,did you use it?

125
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:06,018
It has your name stamped on it
- Yes I could have

126
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:10,791
I did bet, only yesterday
A five pound note, it's true

127
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:14,187
But who knows if it's the same one

128
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:16,868
In any case, you did pass it

129
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:19,749
So?
- It's forged

130
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,800
How did it come into your possession?
- Yes, I recall

131
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:28,235
A patient, he paid his bill with it
- Where is the patient?

132
00:11:28,236 --> 00:11:32,388
Well he's right here...
Mr Clifton

133
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:35,447
Mr Clifton, where did you get it?

134
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:38,663
That question is difficult,
It could be a bank

135
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:42,495
I don't keep a record book
I'm not use to my bills being stamped

136
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:46,812
That's enough Rouper...

137
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:49,878
Mr Clifton will inform us
if he learns anything, come on..

138
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:52,607
I don't like it Peter...

139
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:54,575
Isn't the Chief inspector
supposed to be your friend?

140
00:11:54,749 --> 00:11:57,906
As your guest,he should have tried to
prevent this embarrassment

141
00:11:57,907 --> 00:11:59,396
Come on,let's get a drink

142
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:03,331
An inspector from Scotland Yard
here on business could be ill at ease,

143
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:05,891
but as a guest you're welcome
- Thank you,but you know I don't drink

144
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:11,160
I though you would have joined me in a
toast to the capture of the forger

145
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:14,537
Tonight,yes Chief Inspector
- Of course,cheers

146
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:17,392
Inspector Rouper behaves as if
you forged that note yourself

147
00:12:17,393 --> 00:12:20,456
Why its possible for anyone to have
such a banknote and not know it

148
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:24,198
This forger seems a very
talented fellow indeed

149
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:27,268
Unfortunate,such talent
the bank of England could use

150
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:31,633
I prefer talent,did you know Peter
is a copper plate engraving genius?

151
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:33,599
Yes,Uncle John let me take a
look at some of his etchings

152
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,379
It's a hobby,I do very little

153
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,799
If I was blessed with
half your talent Peter,

154
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,476
I might have done paintings
that were acknowledged

155
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:43,613
Tell me, have you found that printing plate
that you borrowed from Peter some time ago?

156
00:12:43,614 --> 00:12:44,977
I'm afraid not,

157
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:48,638
and I believe you're mistaken Peter,
I'm sure I gave them all back

158
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,919
But I'm not worried at all,
if you find it, good... if not, no loss

159
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,787
My goodness,it's hale

160
00:12:57,665 --> 00:13:03,596
Well here I am...
There you are...

161
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,206
I do hope you're having fun

162
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:12,693
Now a toast,I wish you
both a jolly wedding night

163
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:15,192
And a house full of little kiddies

164
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:19,250
As it says in the bible,
be fruitful and multiply

165
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:24,492
And I will drink to the women,
girls everywhere by the millions,

166
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:27,213
Poor but pretty,and marry for money

167
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:28,711
He's drunk,no Peter

168
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:31,106
I know exactly what's happening here

169
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:35,357
You gave up your affection for me,
so your poor stupid sick uncle

170
00:13:35,358 --> 00:13:39,463
could stop being a kitsch postcard Picasso,
and have security and comfort

171
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,206
Your motives are admirable

172
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:45,786
For you..
- This is for you!

173
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:49,498
Better open the door

174
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,743
I'm sorry Jane...

175
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:57,611
I must say this,your wedding day
has certainly been full of surprises.

176
00:13:57,612 --> 00:14:00,973
May your lives together
continue to be as exciting

177
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:04,347
To get to Longford Castle by daylight,
we have to leave right away,excuse me

178
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:08,881
What luck you have dear,
that awful castle he chooses for a honeymoon

179
00:14:13,104 --> 00:14:15,576
Mr Hale,you have a message

180
00:14:26,401 --> 00:14:29,148
Who gave this to you?
- I didn't recognise him

181
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:37,523
Goodbye,thanks for coming...

182
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,131
Stop!
Peter Clifton!

183
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:47,465
I caught you before you got away
Stop! You can't avoid me

184
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:50,456
I'm aware of that
I've been through all this before

185
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:53,535
I'm Mrs Anderson,of course
he's never told you about me

186
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:59,196
We will not hold a discussion here
We can talk when I return to town

187
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:01,618
One moment!

188
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:03,462
I want this girl to know
the man she's going to live with

189
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:05,688
Calm down and hold your tongue!

190
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:07,890
You're guilty of stealing
his inheritance,

191
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:09,239
the birthright of your own brother

192
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,015
She's off her head, come..

193
00:15:11,016 --> 00:15:13,174
Don't believe a word of it,
the woman is mad!

194
00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:16,776
Stop! If the day comes and I think you're
getting away with any of this

195
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:19,528
I'll be ready to shoot
you down like a filthy dog!

196
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,707
You better watch what you're
saying you hysterical fool

197
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:25,778
It is foolish Mrs Anderson...

198
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,088
What you are saying can
have value for the police,

199
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:30,878
and shouldn't be publicly
announced like this

200
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:32,874
Why are you butting in?

201
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:37,725
I'm a friend of the accused,
Peter Clifton

202
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:50,327
Why didn't you tell me you had a brother?

203
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:53,602
I didn't want to bother you with
the affairs of my family

204
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:56,406
I was wrong,it's my fault

205
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,667
What she said,is it true?
- Of course not!

206
00:16:01,787 --> 00:16:06,739
Sorry,I'm a bit upset I suppose
That stupid scene with the banknote

207
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:15,806
Those men from Scotland Yard, then that
scene with Mrs Anderson, have me on edge

208
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:19,785
Perhaps we would have been better off
with a honeymoon in Rhodesia

209
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:23,851
Do you have a goldmine there?
- Why do you ask that?

210
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:29,207
Just that,you're a rich man
uncle John says you're quite wealthy

211
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:33,670
That money was left to me by my father
There's no mystery

212
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:41,635
Why did you decide on Longford Castle,
do you own it?

213
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:45,446
No, I simply rented it for a few weeks
- Ever been there?

214
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:49,592
Yes, uncle John recommended it,
you'll find it comfortable

215
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:54,483
I hope we're done with those nerve racking
surprises at last, like Mrs Anderson..

216
00:16:54,484 --> 00:16:56,307
Don't worry...

217
00:16:56,308 --> 00:17:00,365
I'm not going to let my family
problems accompany us.

218
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:03,053
Especially not now...

219
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,637
He's coming, go!

220
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:30,537
Why?,he can't see in
through the mirror

221
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:31,538
I told you to go!

222
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:41,967
Ahh, Mr Basil Hale
And what can I do for you?

223
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:44,096
Here,you told me to come

224
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,105
I know.. I know

225
00:17:48,106 --> 00:17:50,421
You wanted to speak to me,
Mr Blonberg?

226
00:17:50,422 --> 00:17:54,369
Yes,to warn you once more,
stay away from Jane

227
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,312
Why? She attracts me,
and I like the game

228
00:17:58,313 --> 00:18:00,870
It's my private affair anyway

229
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,609
As long as it doesn't
interfere with business,

230
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,804
I don't care how many
women you chase

231
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:07,930
But with Jane, I have my own plans,
is that clear?

232
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:10,460
I hear you..

233
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:14,104
You can go now
Well,what is it?

234
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:17,764
Some more cash
- 200 pounds just three days ago?

235
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,746
A shabby 200 pounds...

236
00:18:19,747 --> 00:18:22,055
It's not my affair if you
can't manage your money

237
00:18:22,056 --> 00:18:26,383
Now get out of here before I get angry
Out!

238
00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:50,668
Is there something I can get you Sir?
No thank you James, that'll be all

239
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:06,795
You seem to be in rather a strange mood,
you don't look very happy

240
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:08,852
Really?

241
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:14,792
I'm afraid this isn't really
the time to talk about it,

242
00:19:14,793 --> 00:19:17,224
but I want you to know,
that I plan to deposit

243
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:18,877
100.000 pounds in an account for you

244
00:19:18,878 --> 00:19:21,378
That's generous

245
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:26,395
It's just money..
- It's a fortune, really

246
00:19:26,396 --> 00:19:28,911
Apparently you think
it's enough to buy a woman

247
00:19:28,912 --> 00:19:29,912
Jane...

248
00:19:33,023 --> 00:19:35,794
It's most convenient for
you to buy a woman,isn't it?

249
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:37,898
Except for one thing,

250
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:40,538
you may never buy my love

251
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:43,110
Jane,I know all that,but...

252
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:46,169
I love you...

253
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,447
As my husband,you have rights

254
00:19:50,448 --> 00:19:52,960
I want only what you are prepared to give me

255
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:57,824
Then I'm afraid we have nothing more to say

256
00:20:02,094 --> 00:20:05,974
Goodnight
- Goodnight

257
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:19,171
Who's there please?
- It's me madam

258
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:27,157
I have been waiting
- Thank you

259
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:35,607
Who live in this room before?
- Oh nobody lived here

260
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:38,655
Why not? It's a nice room
- I don't know

261
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,260
You must know who owns the house...

262
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:47,096
An old gentleman who lives abroad,
if he's still among the living

263
00:20:47,097 --> 00:20:48,822
The manager is Blonberg

264
00:20:48,823 --> 00:20:53,391
Sometimes he comes and stays here for
a while madam, but I don't see him

265
00:20:53,392 --> 00:20:54,625
What,you mean you've never seen him?

266
00:20:54,626 --> 00:21:00,495
No madam, when Mr Blonberg comes,
he brings his own staff, a filthy bunch

267
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:04,236
They leave the place like
a pig sty,the filthy pigs

268
00:21:04,237 --> 00:21:06,442
Where are you when Mr Blonbergs here?

269
00:21:06,443 --> 00:21:12,149
I stay with my brother in London,
we're all given leave with full pay

270
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,797
Is there anything else
I can do for you madam?

271
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:14,835
No thank you

272
00:21:14,836 --> 00:21:16,876
Then goodnight
- Goodnight

273
00:22:41,933 --> 00:22:43,389
Peter!

274
00:22:57,392 --> 00:23:00,010
Peter! Peter!

275
00:24:24,043 --> 00:24:26,791
Peter! Peter!

276
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:35,219
Yes,what is it?
Jane!

277
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,768
Oh Peter,a man was
in my room just now,

278
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:41,304
I'm so frightened,where were you

279
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:44,651
I've been in your room looking
- A man in your room you know who...

280
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:48,321
No, I thought he came in from outside
and then I thought maybe it was you

281
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:51,854
But I was down here in... the hall,

282
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:54,870
you wait here, I'll be right back

283
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,725
I've looked everywhere, I saw no one

284
00:25:36,364 --> 00:25:40,044
Jane, you'll catch a cold,
come up to your room

285
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:42,340
No, thank you, I'm all right

286
00:25:50,354 --> 00:25:54,556
Please connect me with
London west end 4316

287
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,963
You can't imagine how disturbed I am

288
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:05,134
Is it at all likely Peter,
that the man she saw was you?

289
00:26:05,135 --> 00:26:06,838
That's what’s so un-nerving,

290
00:26:07,322 --> 00:26:10,720
I have no idea whether I was in
her room last night or not

291
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:15,162
I think when she called out,
I was... downstairs

292
00:26:15,163 --> 00:26:20,789
Help me Wells, I must know the truth
- We will see

293
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,526
But In your case,
I don't think you would have forgotten

294
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,135
I recall your father had an illness,
that you fear was hereditary

295
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:33,550
That doesn't mean you
must be sick too.

296
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,450
You must believe that
you're well and normal

297
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:38,210
You must be upset,but I think
your fears are unfounded

298
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:41,544
After all,didn't professor Clores
clearly say so?

299
00:26:41,545 --> 00:26:44,559
And he's a respected colleague

300
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:50,459
Do you know Anna where the keys
are for the upstairs room?

301
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,717
Well Mr Clifton had them, but I...
- It's alright,I can find them

302
00:27:15,705 --> 00:27:16,835
Did you find the keys?

303
00:27:16,836 --> 00:27:21,483
Oh yes, one question Anna,
when did Mr Blonberg last come?

304
00:27:21,484 --> 00:27:23,384
The beginning of April, madam

305
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:24,351
Stayed long?
- No, only one night

306
00:27:24,386 --> 00:27:29,726
Most of the time, Mr Blonberg comes
in the evening and leaves in the morning

307
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:31,046
Thank you

308
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:40,989
Yes of course Peter, if it helps
you relax, I'll stay and be glad to

309
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,468
Thank you Donald, I'm in your debt of course

310
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:49,478
Oh, you have company

311
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:50,764
Good morning Donald
- Good morning

312
00:27:50,765 --> 00:27:53,963
I've prevailed on Donald
to spend a few days with us

313
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,335
We have some matters we have to discuss

314
00:27:55,336 --> 00:27:58,223
Yes, I ought to give my Marjorie a call

315
00:27:58,224 --> 00:28:00,174
The telephone is in the hall
- Oh thanks

316
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:02,999
Say hello to Marjorie for us
- Of course

317
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,899
Peter, there's something I must show you
Is this that lost plate?

318
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,114
I found it in your room in a cabinet
- You've gone through my things!

319
00:28:12,115 --> 00:28:16,951
Why shouldn't I?
- Jane excuse me, I'm shaky and nervous

320
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,892
In my things you say?

321
00:28:19,893 --> 00:28:22,656
It seems uncle John gave
all the plates back then

322
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:26,323
I guess it was packed
into my luggage somehow

323
00:28:31,756 --> 00:28:35,828
I've barely left London,
and my Marjorie is stepping out

324
00:28:35,829 --> 00:28:40,061
Well I would say any tired marriage
needs something new eh?

325
00:28:40,062 --> 00:28:42,033
Or it'll get dull

326
00:28:42,034 --> 00:28:46,568
A man sometimes meets the right person,
a little too late

327
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:49,000
Oh but Marjorie is right for you

328
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:53,287
Yes of course, but knowing you,
I draw parallels

329
00:28:54,077 --> 00:28:55,691
I thought you were Peters friend

330
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:59,711
True,but imagine what I would do
if I were not his friend

331
00:28:59,712 --> 00:29:02,803
What you would do, is of no interest

332
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:21,200
Hello Jane,
I hope you're not frightened to see me

333
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:23,808
You are mad,
to risk getting another beating...

334
00:29:23,809 --> 00:29:24,809
What do you want?

335
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:28,274
I brought Marjorie here,
and I knew I would see you meanwhile

336
00:29:28,275 --> 00:29:31,802
How are you, are you contented?
No worries?

337
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,541
None of your business!

338
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,668
You have to know,
although you're his wife now.

339
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:40,793
I love you Jane

340
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:43,676
Leave me alone, get lost.. vanish!

341
00:29:43,677 --> 00:29:47,940
Alright, I will... lots of luck

342
00:29:53,078 --> 00:29:55,662
Of course you know that Clifton
married you under a false name

343
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:57,319
What do you mean by that?

344
00:29:57,975 --> 00:30:00,057
Didn't he tell you that
Wellerson is his name?

345
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:01,673
Wellerson?

346
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,690
And of course you don't know why
Dr Wells is staying here with him

347
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:07,529
Because Peter got from his father,
not just money

348
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,959
he also inherited his madness

349
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,566
That's a lie!

350
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:13,592
That Wellerson was mad,
and died a prisoner in Dartmoor

351
00:30:13,593 --> 00:30:16,404
After he murdered to innocent
victims for no reason

352
00:30:16,405 --> 00:30:20,363
Now Peter calls himself Clifton,he's mad!
That's why..

353
00:30:20,364 --> 00:30:22,398
You liar...

354
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:26,250
Don't believe me?
Just ask Dr Wells

355
00:30:26,902 --> 00:30:31,080
I think you should realise what kind of man
your stupid uncle chose for you

356
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:34,897
I warn you Jane,
you're playing with a madman

357
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:36,559
Hale!
What are you looking for here?

358
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Peter..

359
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:41,357
Do you dare to come here?

360
00:30:41,358 --> 00:30:44,538
I thought I ought to open
Jane's eyes for her

361
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:48,398
One moment, Hale..

362
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,985
All of this nonsense,
we'll talk about later on..

363
00:30:51,986 --> 00:30:55,285
But I'm going to straighten you out now,
for something else

364
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,587
This must be a joke..

365
00:30:57,588 --> 00:31:00,034
You sneaked into my wife’s room last night

366
00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:05,587
It's time you learned not to insult Jane,
and I'm going to give you the lesson

367
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,483
Peter!

368
00:31:24,295 --> 00:31:26,168
Peter!
Careful!

369
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:29,265
Hale!
What are you doing?

370
00:31:29,266 --> 00:31:32,114
Now Jane, go!
- Donald... Donald!

371
00:31:50,843 --> 00:31:53,740
You might need this knife
when you learn how to use it

372
00:32:00,936 --> 00:32:02,586
I'm not yet finished with you
Peter Wellerson!

373
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,343
But I'm through with you

374
00:32:04,344 --> 00:32:07,327
How come that Hale is here?
- He brought me out here

375
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:10,659
You have a special gift
for the complicating things

376
00:32:10,694 --> 00:32:13,514
Blinded by love,
I must look after the fellow

377
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:18,032
Peter, you were absolutely marvellous
I really thought that you might kill him

378
00:32:18,033 --> 00:32:20,979
Next time I could do just that
- It was awful..

379
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,601
What stories did he tell you?
- I just can't talk about it now

380
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,799
Forget about Jane,

381
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:31,955
of course I'm nuts about her,
but that isn't why I came here

382
00:32:31,956 --> 00:32:35,370
What would a playboy like you want,
other than that?

383
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:38,005
You don't know me Doctor,
that's too bad...

384
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:41,807
How about I could tell you things,
that'll leave you speechless I'll bet

385
00:32:42,955 --> 00:32:45,350
Longford Castle is a fantastic place,

386
00:32:45,351 --> 00:32:48,294
it could be where our
forger friend plays his game

387
00:32:48,295 --> 00:32:51,040
Surprised?
- Yes, very surprised

388
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:55,370
If I wanted to, I could reveal his name

389
00:32:57,904 --> 00:33:00,497
Every now and then,
Peter seems so strange, dear

390
00:33:00,498 --> 00:33:02,538
Peter isn't insane,if that's what you mean

391
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:07,096
No dear, but his father was.
The scars on his face might remind you,

392
00:33:07,097 --> 00:33:10,631
his father threw acid in that face
when Peter was a very young boy

393
00:33:10,632 --> 00:33:11,752
Please, I've heard enough

394
00:33:11,753 --> 00:33:15,614
Yes yes, of course,
perhaps he just pretends madness

395
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:19,362
Nonsense, after all, I'm his wife now

396
00:33:19,363 --> 00:33:22,170
Does Donald ever talk to you
about Peters illness?

397
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:26,579
No no, remember,a doctor never
talks about his patients at any time

398
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,145
well Jane, are you a contented wife now?

399
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:35,030
Excuse me, but I could relax now,
if... if I knew you were happy

400
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:36,031
Why?

401
00:33:36,032 --> 00:33:40,971
Restless young wives attract men,
who are restless after years of marriage

402
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:45,174
I don't understand
- I speak of my husband

403
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:53,383
Now listen Peter, I've been thinking,
your recent thinking lacks clarity

404
00:33:53,384 --> 00:33:59,255
Now for example,you don't know for sure,
if you were in Jane’s room or not

405
00:33:59,256 --> 00:34:01,398
Understand?
- Yes

406
00:34:02,002 --> 00:34:05,672
And the etchings you do..
Of course,they're excellent works

407
00:34:05,673 --> 00:34:10,730
But that's not unusual for schizophrenics...
I mean that,a talent like you have

408
00:34:10,731 --> 00:34:14,780
I can't say for sure,
but I can say that Hale,

409
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:17,548
thinks... you're the forger

410
00:34:17,549 --> 00:34:20,796
That's absurd!
- Everything has to be considered

411
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:26,257
Donald, am I imagining that I inherited
my fathers illness or am I really...

412
00:34:26,258 --> 00:34:27,881
Take it easy now..

413
00:34:27,882 --> 00:34:32,011
I'll give you an injection later,
just to calm you

414
00:34:33,555 --> 00:34:35,707
Yes, fine Donald

415
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:58,862
Is that you Peter?
- No it's me, Jane

416
00:35:08,186 --> 00:35:10,936
I'm sorry Jane,
I thought that you were still up

417
00:35:10,937 --> 00:35:14,835
This castle, I can't think
of it as home at all

418
00:35:14,836 --> 00:35:18,864
You might go sleep in your house then
- I would, he doesn't want to

419
00:35:18,865 --> 00:35:21,184
And how is Peter?
- I think he's sleeping

420
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:24,807
Donald gave him something to sleep..
- Oh good..

421
00:35:51,279 --> 00:35:53,620
You didn't know that before
Donald came here, Thank you

422
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:55,455
He had a very poor
practise in South London,

423
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:57,894
we weren't very well off then

424
00:35:57,895 --> 00:35:59,508
Matches are over there..
- Thank you

425
00:35:59,509 --> 00:36:02,955
He met Mr Blonberg in London,
a hypochondriac

426
00:36:02,956 --> 00:36:04,370
Mr Blonberg,
the manager of the castle?

427
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:07,061
- Yes, that's possible,
he dabbles in everything

428
00:36:07,062 --> 00:36:09,167
Then he loaned Donald a lot of cash,

429
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:12,383
we moved to the West End,
and things looked up

430
00:36:12,384 --> 00:36:14,977
Yes, Donald’s good at making impressions

431
00:36:16,495 --> 00:36:18,455
Minds that are sick,

432
00:36:18,456 --> 00:36:22,766
need a doctor
they can have faith in,that's all

433
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,153
What was that!

434
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:28,505
What... what was that awful scream?

435
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:33,888
No! no!
Turn on the light first!

436
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,325
What is it?

437
00:36:44,084 --> 00:36:46,775
Nothing..
- Then what was it?

438
00:36:46,776 --> 00:36:47,958
Maybe just an owl

439
00:36:47,959 --> 00:36:51,833
- No no, that wasn't an owl,
that was a lunatic

440
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,526
Yes... yes, a lunatic

441
00:36:55,527 --> 00:36:58,675
Donald once took me into
an asylum for lunatics

442
00:36:58,676 --> 00:37:01,172
The things that I saw and heard there..

443
00:37:01,173 --> 00:37:04,964
Shrieks and cries,
a man cried out just as if he..

444
00:37:06,177 --> 00:37:10,068
What was that?
It's at the door!

445
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,367
I'll find out..

446
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:19,595
No, don't open that door, I beg you don't!
- No ones there at all..

447
00:37:19,596 --> 00:37:22,031
I'm terrified...

448
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:26,565
Jane, come with me to my rooms will you...
Surely,if it'll make you feel better

449
00:37:26,566 --> 00:37:27,566
Yes..

450
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:41,326
Are you really so frightened?
- How frightened I am, you can't imagine

451
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:44,573
One moment, I'll see if anyone’s in my room

452
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:50,114
No, Jane, thank you
- Sleep well..

453
00:38:20,155 --> 00:38:22,526
Peter.. Peter..

454
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:26,120
Hale... you swine!

455
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:10,073
Jane, what are you doing
out here in the garden?

456
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:12,090
I saw you from the window..
- Hale!

457
00:39:20,009 --> 00:39:21,012
Is he dead?

458
00:39:24,317 --> 00:39:26,959
Yes, he's dead

459
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,772
Skull crushed,with a hammer I guess,
or something

460
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,108
Is Peter awake?

461
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:37,876
I have no idea,
I haven't been to his room yet

462
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:42,879
We'll go to him,we must touch
nothing here 'till the police come

463
00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:48,912
Open the curtains will you..

464
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:03,270
What the... What's wrong with him?

465
00:40:03,271 --> 00:40:06,953
I imagine it's the injection you gave him
- Yes, but it should have worn off

466
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:08,936
Peter! hello..
Peter!

467
00:40:10,936 --> 00:40:15,594
Oh.. my poor head,
it's going to burst wide open

468
00:40:15,595 --> 00:40:17,624
He's half dressed,
where are his other clothes?

469
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,340
That's not important now

470
00:40:19,341 --> 00:40:22,126
Donald,that was a
strong injection you gave me

471
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:24,019
I feel awful..

472
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,001
Yes, it will soon go away

473
00:40:29,398 --> 00:40:33,334
You look at me so strangely,
what do you want of me?

474
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:35,823
You should have a sedative

475
00:40:35,824 --> 00:40:39,333
Peter, someone was killed in the garden

476
00:40:39,334 --> 00:40:42,973
Killed?
Who?

477
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:47,467
Jane found the body, Basil Hale...

478
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:52,341
Hale... was murdered?

479
00:40:54,888 --> 00:40:55,933
Do you know who...

480
00:40:55,934 --> 00:40:56,934
Drink..

481
00:41:08,493 --> 00:41:09,957
A London newspaper...

482
00:41:09,958 --> 00:41:14,096
Yes, printed at 4 o'clock
But the body was found at about 7

483
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,913
That means they got
an early report

484
00:41:16,914 --> 00:41:20,233
Perhaps it could be the
murderer himself

485
00:41:26,246 --> 00:41:30,101
Alright, let's get the stretcher
aboard and get moving!

486
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:40,527
Burke! You're here,
that's a bit of a surprise..

487
00:41:40,528 --> 00:41:43,577
Well, I don't know about that, Peter

488
00:41:43,578 --> 00:41:45,670
I asked the Chief Inspector to come out
You know why..

489
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:47,093
I've no idea..

490
00:41:47,094 --> 00:41:52,759
But Peter, don't you recall?
Basil Hale was Brutally murdered

491
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,265
Yes Peter, we told you about it
- Hale was murdered, when?

492
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,652
Last night, probably just after 12

493
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:06,962
How do you know it was after midnight?
Anyway, I slept through it..

494
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,401
Just before 12,
Hale gave Scotland Yard a call

495
00:42:09,402 --> 00:42:12,412
He claimed that he knew Longford Castle
was the place that the forger worked

496
00:42:12,413 --> 00:42:15,453
He said that a room hidden
behind that bookcase,

497
00:42:15,454 --> 00:42:17,462
had a complete forgery operation in it

498
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:22,677
Forgery here, that bookcase?
- Yes, Hale was very specific,come on

499
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,984
Hello, Rouper, what brings you here?

500
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:29,546
You don't mind I hope,
Dr wells asked me to come

501
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,837
Yes, two inspectors
can find twice as much

502
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:35,890
Very good, let's check that room

503
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:54,213
Well look, now that's a surprise

504
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,629
Our boy is a fast mover..

505
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:07,574
There's now doubt about it,
acids have been used here

506
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,201
Yes, you can see where the
printing press was fastened

507
00:43:12,202 --> 00:43:15,882
Do you believe the forger was in here?
- Once again, he's too fast for us

508
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:18,556
He is clever

509
00:43:19,214 --> 00:43:20,606
Yes,but there's a murder,

510
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:23,456
for which I have our man, Mr Clifton

511
00:43:23,457 --> 00:43:26,568
You're not serious Inspector
- I am

512
00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:28,597
No, he is not serious,

513
00:43:29,163 --> 00:43:32,569
Please ring up Scotland Yard and find out
who informed them of the murder

514
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,315
I already did that

515
00:43:34,316 --> 00:43:36,126
The telephone operator
of the local exchange,

516
00:43:36,127 --> 00:43:38,214
said it was Mr Clifton on the line

517
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:41,041
He recognised the voice
from previous calls

518
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:45,524
Even so Rouper,
we can't bring in Mr Clifton

519
00:43:45,525 --> 00:43:48,676
until we find the weapon
with which Hale was killed

520
00:43:48,677 --> 00:43:52,344
We've found no such weapon,have we?

521
00:43:52,345 --> 00:43:55,515
Is it a wonder that the weapon is missing?

522
00:43:55,516 --> 00:43:59,139
Do you really expect,
the murderer has it in his room?

523
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,829
He might think we're that naive

524
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:12,133
Who's there?
- It's me, Peter

525
00:44:17,843 --> 00:44:20,190
Why do you lock the door?
- No reason

526
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:26,823
You're packing?

527
00:44:30,703 --> 00:44:32,937
You changed my clothes last night..

528
00:44:33,314 --> 00:44:37,754
A bloody shirt doesn't suit you.
Your hands had to be washed too

529
00:44:39,937 --> 00:44:42,511
I don't remember that
I really killed that man

530
00:44:44,188 --> 00:44:46,620
I've been terrified of
doing something like...

531
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:48,581
My father..

532
00:44:59,796 --> 00:45:01,743
Jane...

533
00:45:08,117 --> 00:45:11,237
I did an awful thing,getting you into this

534
00:45:12,272 --> 00:45:15,911
Jane, you can still go away

535
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:22,558
I'm your wife,and I won't just give you up..

536
00:45:26,415 --> 00:45:27,567
Thank you Jane..

537
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:32,936
There must be no secrets between us
- Should I tell Burke everything?

538
00:45:32,937 --> 00:45:36,772
No, don't tell him yet, you can
tell him about the fight, but no more...

539
00:45:36,773 --> 00:45:39,981
Good Jane, you go back
to London with Burke

540
00:45:39,982 --> 00:45:41,432
He said he would take you

541
00:45:41,433 --> 00:45:43,700
Oh, but it's here I want to be, dear

542
00:45:44,435 --> 00:45:47,643
No Jane, I must handle this alone

543
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:52,413
But it means so much that you understand

544
00:46:03,237 --> 00:46:07,957
That wasn't much of a honeymoon
- I might just go back tomorrow

545
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:13,258
Peter loves you, and you?
- You have to ask?

546
00:46:13,259 --> 00:46:17,176
In London, they feel his money attracted you

547
00:46:18,048 --> 00:46:20,265
That's partially true of course

548
00:46:20,266 --> 00:46:25,341
But my feelings towards Peter
changed when I knew of his danger

549
00:46:25,342 --> 00:46:27,052
Funny, Isn't it?

550
00:46:27,053 --> 00:46:30,616
I can understand, and I'm glad for Peter

551
00:46:30,617 --> 00:46:32,891
It doesn't look good for him at all

552
00:46:32,892 --> 00:46:35,426
The circumstantial evidence is against him

553
00:46:35,427 --> 00:46:38,548
Too bad the murder weapon
didn't turn up

554
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:42,002
It could change our entire approach

555
00:46:42,003 --> 00:46:47,733
You tell me now, you wouldn't know
where the hammer might be?

556
00:46:47,734 --> 00:46:49,915
I? How should I?

557
00:46:49,916 --> 00:46:52,447
My dear young woman,
you want another thousand pounds?

558
00:46:52,448 --> 00:46:55,767
That's a lot of money
- I'm not worth a lot of money?

559
00:46:55,768 --> 00:46:59,520
Once my legacy is straightened out,
there will be millions in my hands

560
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:02,934
It won't go that far now Mrs Anderson
- What are you inferring?

561
00:47:02,935 --> 00:47:05,417
You can thank your imbecilic son

562
00:47:05,418 --> 00:47:10,645
Oh but Basil is a clever young fellow
You just have something against him!

563
00:47:10,646 --> 00:47:14,472
Several times I warned him
to leave Jane Clifton alone

564
00:47:14,473 --> 00:47:16,790
Still, he went out to Longford Castle!

565
00:47:16,791 --> 00:47:18,981
Oh, but you don't understand

566
00:47:18,982 --> 00:47:22,820
He's a born gentleman
who does what he wants to do

567
00:47:22,821 --> 00:47:26,394
Come here, you don't seem
to read the newspapers

568
00:47:29,807 --> 00:47:33,679
Basil Hale, murdered on castle grounds?

569
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:39,717
Dead! dead!
Peter Wellerson did it!

570
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:42,208
That beast.. monster... murderer!

571
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:45,962
My son,my son...

572
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,798
May I please speak to Longford Castle
Who is this?

573
00:47:48,799 --> 00:47:51,284
Oh it's you, listen..

574
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,546
Good afternoon
- Good afternoon

575
00:48:04,547 --> 00:48:05,596
Thank you

576
00:48:05,597 --> 00:48:07,372
Take it to my room please

577
00:48:07,373 --> 00:48:09,007
I'll unpack the suitcase myself
- Yes madam

578
00:48:09,008 --> 00:48:11,417
A friend of Mr Clifton is here to see you

579
00:48:11,418 --> 00:48:13,609
My Uncle?
- I don't know who it is

580
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,529
Goodbye Mr Burke,
and thanks for the ride

581
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:20,747
I'll wait here for you, if I may..
- Of Course.. bring some tea for Mr Burke

582
00:48:27,833 --> 00:48:30,489
My name is Radlowe
Yes?

583
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,398
I am Peter's legal adviser

584
00:48:32,399 --> 00:48:36,046
I've been reading all the morning papers
Embarrassing of course..

585
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:39,045
I decided to get right over here,
and not waste any time

586
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:42,198
Hale is responsible for it all
He's as crazy as his mother

587
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:45,764
A stupid old woman, Mrs Anderson
- Anderson?

588
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:48,014
She disrupts my entire office staff
when she shows up

589
00:48:48,015 --> 00:48:50,150
Excellent arrangements have
been made for her

590
00:48:50,151 --> 00:48:55,014
But she's always short, money
.. always the same

591
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,879
Mrs Anderson is Hale's mother?

592
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,790
In that case,Peter...
- Yes..

593
00:48:58,791 --> 00:49:02,664
Annoying situation,
I think someone knows too much

594
00:49:02,665 --> 00:49:04,730
This is not good for Peter

595
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,910
I'll have to do something to clear
Peter of this suspicion

596
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:15,116
If they read his fathers testament
correctly at least,it'll help

597
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:19,971
It's a mistake for Peter,
not to make everything public

598
00:49:20,006 --> 00:49:21,864
Please have him call me immediately

599
00:49:21,899 --> 00:49:23,289
There's no reason for him to hide anything

600
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:26,218
Goodbye Madam
- Goodbye

601
00:49:27,777 --> 00:49:30,539
That was Peter's solicitor,
what did he want?

602
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,380
I missed what he meant,

603
00:49:32,381 --> 00:49:35,924
His talk was confusing,
he said something must be done now

604
00:49:35,925 --> 00:49:38,758
You're so right Mrs Clifton,
the whole situation is confused

605
00:49:38,759 --> 00:49:43,342
But understand,that in theory,
I'm always on duty

606
00:49:43,343 --> 00:49:44,562
But I have to relax once in a while

607
00:49:44,563 --> 00:49:46,357
And since ten minutes ago,

608
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,195
I'm a civilian,and a very good
friend of Peter's

609
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:52,032
And so I'd like to talk
about a hammer at this time

610
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:57,030
And of a lost suit
And of course, the bloody shirt

611
00:49:57,031 --> 00:49:58,766
Why mention it to me?

612
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:02,275
If I were sure that they were in the
hands of a person who is peter's friend

613
00:50:02,276 --> 00:50:05,116
It would mean that I could relax a little

614
00:50:05,117 --> 00:50:08,062
The tea
- Thank you, I'll take it

615
00:50:09,226 --> 00:50:11,175
I have a weakness for tea

616
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,125
And a weakness for the poor..

617
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:16,626
Therefore if you had a secondhand suit..
- Please sit down

618
00:50:16,627 --> 00:50:20,887
Thank you,well if you had an old suit,
and an old shirt..

619
00:50:20,888 --> 00:50:22,370
I could make very good use of them

620
00:50:22,371 --> 00:50:23,906
Tools too,

621
00:50:23,907 --> 00:50:28,596
few criminals can get honest jobs
for lack of good tools

622
00:50:28,597 --> 00:50:29,801
Don't forget Mrs Clifton,

623
00:50:29,802 --> 00:50:34,643
Inspector Rouper is looking for
used articles, for his own poor

624
00:50:34,644 --> 00:50:38,809
So if you... if you have something
you have to get rid of...

625
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,820
Then I would rather give it to you,
than anyone

626
00:50:41,821 --> 00:50:47,044
That's very good,you know that Mr Rouper
could show up with a search warrant soon

627
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:50,132
Can you imagine how the police search?
- No..

628
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:53,017
Then I must show you how we proceed

629
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:57,976
Hello, taxi!
Taxi...

630
00:51:04,945 --> 00:51:06,281
You wait here!

631
00:51:45,518 --> 00:51:50,961
Stop! Who are you?
- My name is Miller, I'm an organist,

632
00:51:50,962 --> 00:51:53,574
What do you want?
- Sorry..

633
00:51:58,145 --> 00:52:00,114
Do you know the combination?
- No..

634
00:52:00,115 --> 00:52:03,280
The code word for it is just this,it's Jane

635
00:52:03,281 --> 00:52:06,406
So many secrets Peter and I shared together

636
00:52:06,407 --> 00:52:08,589
He's only afraid..
- Afraid of what?

637
00:52:09,831 --> 00:52:14,345
And there it is..
- What is it?

638
00:52:15,742 --> 00:52:18,983
This is a book that Inspector Rouper
would like to find

639
00:52:18,984 --> 00:52:21,822
A notebook
- A notebook? I didn't know about this

640
00:52:21,823 --> 00:52:25,192
Neither did I, it's a diary he kept

641
00:52:25,193 --> 00:52:27,458
You'd think Peter wouldn't be so careless

642
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:31,626
That indicates 240 hundred dollar bills,
United States currency

643
00:52:31,627 --> 00:52:35,808
All very well made, and posted to Baltimore.
It's awful..

644
00:52:36,365 --> 00:52:39,442
And here,700,000 on the
Swiss National Bank,

645
00:52:39,443 --> 00:52:42,671
excellent plate,only two mis-prints

646
00:52:42,672 --> 00:52:46,991
And so forth,and so forth, and so forth..
- Then,it is true

647
00:52:46,992 --> 00:52:51,016
I'm sure I better put this
with the old clothes,

648
00:52:51,017 --> 00:52:54,214
which I'm sure you will give me
without delay,Mrs Clifton

649
00:52:56,131 --> 00:53:00,422
Whom can you trust?
You must trust someone now

650
00:53:01,183 --> 00:53:06,710
At the moment,I don't feel on duty,
a private individual, hmm?

651
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:13,582
Wait right here
- Yes

652
00:53:30,854 --> 00:53:33,167
Here are the old clothes
- Yes

653
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,044
Inspector Rouper from Scotland Yard

654
00:53:35,888 --> 00:53:40,081
Sorry Mrs Clifton, I have to
discharge an unpleasant duty

655
00:53:40,082 --> 00:53:42,979
Unless the Chief Inspector
has already completed it

656
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:47,389
No, this is a social call,
do your duty my friend

657
00:53:48,455 --> 00:53:50,272
My dear Rouper,

658
00:53:50,273 --> 00:53:54,398
I have to carry my own laundry
to be cleaned, a bachelor you know

659
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:57,076
Goodbye Mrs Clifton
- Goodbye Mr Burke

660
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:04,218
Here's a search warrant,now show me to
your husbands room,if you please

661
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:06,116
Follow me

662
00:54:17,092 --> 00:54:21,249
Hello Mary,is my wife at home?
Yes, I want to speak to her

663
00:54:24,172 --> 00:54:29,927
Yes Jane, not encouraging I'm afraid

664
00:54:29,928 --> 00:54:32,685
The professors opinion is that
my illness can strike again

665
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:35,743
The professor is guessing,
I don't believe it!

666
00:54:36,779 --> 00:54:39,192
Oh, by the way,your lawyer
Mr Radlowe was here,

667
00:54:39,193 --> 00:54:40,493
he wants you to call

668
00:54:40,494 --> 00:54:43,400
I have no idea what he wants,
except it's important

669
00:54:43,401 --> 00:54:47,463
It's now nearly six,
I'll leave here by seven,

670
00:54:47,464 --> 00:54:50,013
I hope to see you by 9 o' clock

671
00:54:50,014 --> 00:54:53,156
I can't wait...
Goodbye..

672
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,686
Excuse me professor,

673
00:54:56,687 --> 00:54:59,714
I must ring up my solicitor
- Of course

674
00:54:59,715 --> 00:55:03,462
What I wanted to say...
- A moment,after he makes his call

675
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:09,144
Hello,Mr Radlowe,this is Peter Clifton,
you said to call

676
00:55:09,145 --> 00:55:11,500
A telegram I sent to your
London address is waiting for you

677
00:55:11,501 --> 00:55:15,784
Things are not going well
- What shall we do?

678
00:55:17,377 --> 00:55:19,919
I shouldn't continue to try
to keep things quiet?

679
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,136
Very well then...
In any case,I'll go to London

680
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:28,213
Yes,when you're ready,let me know.
Goodbye

681
00:55:30,533 --> 00:55:33,040
Important?
- Maybe

682
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:35,153
Radlowe wants me to make a
voluntary statement

683
00:55:35,154 --> 00:55:36,064
On what?

684
00:55:36,065 --> 00:55:37,954
I'm not really sure,

685
00:55:37,955 --> 00:55:40,216
it has to do with the testament
of my father though

686
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:41,701
Testament of your father?

687
00:55:41,702 --> 00:55:44,998
Yes,Radlowe wants me to do it quickly

688
00:55:46,646 --> 00:55:51,367
Don't be upset my dear,Mr Hale was no loss,
a miserable tramp

689
00:55:51,368 --> 00:55:53,983
However,Peter worries me a little

690
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:58,526
I feel responsible for you marrying him
- You don't need to feel that way

691
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:03,809
Well of course you know I was a bit upset,
worried.. My illness,

692
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:07,234
I would have enjoyed
travelling south with you

693
00:56:07,235 --> 00:56:12,660
No longer to be a postcard Picasso,
to give it all up

694
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:15,251
Oh,don't say that Uncle John..

695
00:56:15,252 --> 00:56:17,339
Your pictures have always
been wonderful to me

696
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,983
It's not important

697
00:56:18,984 --> 00:56:24,600
The important thing is you and Peter
Fortunately,you don't love him

698
00:56:27,399 --> 00:56:28,775
Well,isn't that so?

699
00:56:30,919 --> 00:56:32,805
Now listen Uncle John,

700
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,774
I've been getting to
know peter very well

701
00:56:36,475 --> 00:56:38,958
He's my husband,and I'll stand by him

702
00:56:40,165 --> 00:56:45,143
You mean you're in love?
Tell me,are you?

703
00:56:45,644 --> 00:56:48,702
Yes..
- Why,that's wonderful

704
00:56:48,703 --> 00:56:51,696
Well it's wonderful, if it
wasn't for this trouble

705
00:56:51,697 --> 00:56:55,588
Now if Peter wasn't.. wasn't completely...
- You mean he's insane?

706
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:58,268
No,please don't mention it again

707
00:56:58,691 --> 00:57:00,849
Oh by the way,here's that
plate that was lost

708
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:01,639
Oh,where was it?

709
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,060
In Longford Castle
- What did you say,Longford Castle?

710
00:57:05,095 --> 00:57:07,820
Yes,somehow it seems to have
slipped into Peter's luggage

711
00:57:07,821 --> 00:57:11,340
You see.. I said I gave all the
printing plates back to Peter

712
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:15,083
But a thought occures to me
that's frightening

713
00:57:15,084 --> 00:57:17,433
I've been told by Wells,
that at Longford Castle

714
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,736
a secret room was discovered

715
00:57:19,737 --> 00:57:21,982
And considering that Peter
is such an expert engraver, Well...

716
00:57:21,983 --> 00:57:23,382
What do you mean?

717
00:57:23,383 --> 00:57:26,623
That Peter really is a schizophrenic,
leading a double life

718
00:57:26,624 --> 00:57:30,927
Peter in this life with you
And Peter the shrewd and ruthless forger..

719
00:57:30,928 --> 00:57:34,069
Oh Uncle,stop it..
It's just too absurd

720
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:36,527
I am sorry my darling,
I don't want you to be hurt

721
00:57:36,528 --> 00:57:40,904
But we must except
the conclusions that exist

722
00:57:43,917 --> 00:57:47,436
Do you hear me?
Answer me Peter Clifton alias Blonberg

723
00:57:47,437 --> 00:57:50,394
It was my son you killed,your brother!

724
00:57:50,395 --> 00:57:54,096
You murderer!
You brutal murderer!

725
00:57:54,097 --> 00:57:56,837
I'll kill you,I'll get revenge

726
00:58:00,455 --> 00:58:03,214
Hello,excuse her please
- Who is this?

727
00:58:03,215 --> 00:58:06,559
It's the Doctor,she's sick

728
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,559
Hello..
- Don't let it worry you my dear

729
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,840
Mrs Anderson is insane,she made it
very clear at the wedding party

730
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:18,367
Who isn't mad now?
Even I might be

731
00:58:18,368 --> 00:58:22,314
She thinks Peter is the one
who killed Basil her son

732
00:58:22,315 --> 00:58:27,700
Basil Hale was her son?
- Yes,it's all so confusing Uncle

733
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,915
My leather coat please

734
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:36,820
Tell me,what do you know of Blonberg?
- He's a broker,that's all I know

735
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:41,231
You know he's the manager of Longford Castle
- Yes,but is he involved?

736
00:58:41,232 --> 00:58:43,721
I'm convinced that Blonberg
has a lot of answers for us

737
00:58:43,722 --> 00:58:45,787
And I'm going to see him in person

738
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,966
Oh yes,my name is Blonberg,

739
00:58:47,967 --> 00:58:51,552
I'm honoured by your visit Mrs Clifton

740
00:58:51,553 --> 00:58:54,086
You manage Longford Castle,
I want the name of the owner

741
00:58:55,433 --> 00:58:57,133
Be seated here,please

742
00:59:01,562 --> 00:59:05,448
The owner of Longford Castle is an
old fellow who lives in Florence,

743
00:59:05,449 --> 00:59:07,306
he's never been seen here at all

744
00:59:07,734 --> 00:59:09,721
It seems strange doesn't it

745
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:14,327
We transmit his money to his Paris bank
- And his name,please tell me that

746
00:59:14,328 --> 00:59:18,324
I know it sure,but I cannot
just give it out,you see miss

747
00:59:18,325 --> 00:59:20,667
If the gentleman said not to

748
00:59:20,668 --> 00:59:23,720
Another question,
do you know a Mrs Anderson?

749
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,670
No,this name I've never heard,

750
00:59:26,671 --> 00:59:29,999
oh, but to be sure I'll ask my
employees if they know the name

751
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,120
No,you don't have to,

752
00:59:31,121 --> 00:59:33,554
you personally do not know her?
- No

753
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:36,419
Then excuse all the questions
- It was no trouble

754
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:38,904
May I show you...
- Thank you,I know the way

755
00:59:38,905 --> 00:59:41,368
Very well then..
Good day..

756
00:59:56,477 --> 01:00:00,445
Hello Mrs Clifton
- Oh good day Chief Inspector Burke

757
01:00:00,446 --> 01:00:03,765
Did you buy any real estate?
- You were watching me?

758
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:05,949
If you'll allow me,
I'll keep a bit of an eye on you

759
01:00:05,950 --> 01:00:08,163
Oh,and the man who owns
Longford castle is Branes

760
01:00:08,164 --> 01:00:11,198
You know you should have asked me,
for his name

761
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:13,510
I'll take you home,come along

762
01:00:17,179 --> 01:00:21,079
Oh, I have to tell you something
that might be unpleasant Mrs Clifton

763
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:22,318
About Peter?

764
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:26,831
That depends,it's about the clothing
you gave me for the poor people

765
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,813
I found myself in the middle
of Westminster Bridge,

766
01:00:29,814 --> 01:00:31,536
when I felt like a cigarette suddenly

767
01:00:31,537 --> 01:00:33,532
Would you like one?
- Thank you

768
01:00:33,533 --> 01:00:37,700
Does Peter smoke these too?
- Not these..

769
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:42,024
So, I put the parcel down
on the railing of the bridge

770
01:00:42,025 --> 01:00:45,614
And then, I must have leaned
against it,or something

771
01:00:46,546 --> 01:00:50,688
And then it dropped into the water,
Sank like a stone,

772
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:56,042
I imagine it was the tools that made it sink

773
01:00:56,043 --> 01:01:00,786
I just can't figure you out Mr Burke..
You're more puzzling all the time

774
01:01:00,787 --> 01:01:02,894
I'm just doing my job

775
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:11,750
Are you Mr Clifton?
- No,Mrs Clifton is here

776
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,759
A Telegram
- Hello,Mrs Clifton

777
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,116
Yes?
- A Telegram for you

778
01:01:18,566 --> 01:01:21,231
From Peter?
- No,for Peter

779
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:25,463
I would still open it up.
Allow me please..

780
01:01:26,776 --> 01:01:30,781
Come to Sydenham,document 21 ready at 3
Go to the police tomorrow

781
01:01:30,782 --> 01:01:34,216
Signed Radlowe
- I guess Peter didn't call Radlowe

782
01:01:34,217 --> 01:01:37,802
Document goes to the police..
A bit strange...

783
01:01:37,803 --> 01:01:40,470
It's well past 8,
shouldn't Peter be here now?

784
01:01:40,471 --> 01:01:43,461
I don't understand it,
I better ring up Longford Castle

785
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:54,160
Longford Castle...

786
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,198
No Mrs Clifton,your husband
isn't here now,he left

787
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:01,731
Yes, I'd say it's been 2 hours
- Thank you Anna

788
01:02:01,732 --> 01:02:04,224
I don't understand,
Peter left 2 hours ago

789
01:02:04,225 --> 01:02:06,537
I don't like it much either..

790
01:02:06,538 --> 01:02:08,326
I'm off to Sydenham to see that lawyer
- I'll go too..

791
01:02:08,327 --> 01:02:12,510
No no,if you stay here it'll be better
- Why must I,any reason?

792
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:14,001
Alright, if you wish..

793
01:03:17,772 --> 01:03:21,405
It's very dark around here,
do you know the house sir?

794
01:03:23,259 --> 01:03:25,710
There's Peter's car,it's right there

795
01:03:34,355 --> 01:03:35,755
How come his car is here?

796
01:03:35,756 --> 01:03:39,893
The smell of this is foul, please see
if the key is in it,and wait right here

797
01:04:38,115 --> 01:04:40,043
Yes, the key is there..
- I'm not surprised..

798
01:04:40,044 --> 01:04:41,492
But what does all this mean?

799
01:04:41,493 --> 01:04:43,271
Can you drive it?
- Yes I can,but..

800
01:04:43,272 --> 01:04:44,222
It's good we're here,

801
01:04:44,223 --> 01:04:46,491
we'll drive around the corner,
we have to be careful

802
01:04:46,492 --> 01:04:47,211
Yes but I...

803
01:04:47,212 --> 01:04:49,665
You wait there,and don't
get scared when I come back

804
01:05:08,317 --> 01:05:10,359
Open the car door,
quick!

805
01:05:14,654 --> 01:05:18,384
Peter my dear,what happened,is he..?
- He's unconcious,but not hurt

806
01:05:18,385 --> 01:05:20,116
Drive home at once,be sure
you're not seen bringing him in

807
01:05:20,117 --> 01:05:23,246
And listen,Peter was not here at all
- Yes

808
01:05:44,385 --> 01:05:47,675
Are you Mr Clifton?
Mr Radlowe is waiting for you

809
01:05:47,676 --> 01:05:49,535
This way please,
Mr clif...

810
01:05:52,434 --> 01:05:54,174
Call the nearest police station

811
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:56,437
Have them send the
homicide squad immediately

812
01:05:56,472 --> 01:05:58,455
What are you waiting for?

813
01:06:33,831 --> 01:06:38,165
All his notes are missing,
he had just started on the seventh page

814
01:06:38,166 --> 01:06:40,091
If we knew what was on the last pages,

815
01:06:40,092 --> 01:06:42,272
we would know the murderer
of Radlowe and Hale

816
01:06:43,007 --> 01:06:46,279
Rouper,you're alert today..
- Think so, eh?

817
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:50,437
The housemaid has told us,
Radlowe had expected Mr Clifton to come

818
01:06:50,438 --> 01:06:54,136
Think he was here?
- Not him Rouper

819
01:06:54,137 --> 01:06:57,422
Mr Clifton sent me instead,you see

820
01:06:58,824 --> 01:07:00,948
These footprints are still wet

821
01:07:00,949 --> 01:07:01,949
I protest!

822
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:04,304
This is a scandalous treatment
for a good taxpayer

823
01:07:04,305 --> 01:07:06,693
Indeed,I protest
- We found this man loitering about

824
01:07:08,161 --> 01:07:11,320
Hey watch it,what are you doing?
Look out there!

825
01:07:11,321 --> 01:07:13,377
Be careful!
Who are you?

826
01:07:13,378 --> 01:07:15,956
My name is stone,I'm a neighbour
you see,I'm right next door

827
01:07:15,957 --> 01:07:17,539
You live next door?
- Yes sir

828
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:20,314
About an hour ago,did you see something?
- Yes,yes I did

829
01:07:20,315 --> 01:07:22,778
About an hour ago,I was walking
peacefully with Socrates,

830
01:07:22,779 --> 01:07:24,089
that's my dog you see

831
01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:25,709
And I'm sure I saw a man go to
the rear entrance here

832
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:28,247
You saw him?
- Was he tall or short?

833
01:07:28,248 --> 01:07:30,436
Rather tall
- Was he relaxed or in a rush?

834
01:07:30,437 --> 01:07:34,809
Erect or bent?
Did he walk erect or not?

835
01:07:34,810 --> 01:07:37,105
He was erect, and in a rush

836
01:07:37,106 --> 01:07:40,169
I rather expected that kind of description

837
01:07:41,027 --> 01:07:44,232
Can I go now?
May I go sir?

838
01:07:44,233 --> 01:07:47,120
May I please leave now?
May I go?

839
01:07:47,121 --> 01:07:49,336
Something there?
- May I go now

840
01:07:49,337 --> 01:07:52,698
This?
Nothing important

841
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:00,198
He's asleep..

842
01:08:00,199 --> 01:08:03,090
He was conscious briefly,he got
out of the car,came in the house

843
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,619
Then he didn't remember a thing

844
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:06,781
Now I want to know Mr Burke,

845
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:10,916
at the house in Sydenham,what happened?
- Mr Radlowe,was murdered

846
01:08:10,917 --> 01:08:15,544
Oh god.. that means that he..
- Please don't ask any further questions

847
01:08:32,826 --> 01:08:36,196
Interesting,lots of cash

848
01:08:36,197 --> 01:08:39,485
I removed the hand written confession
that was in his left shoe

849
01:08:39,486 --> 01:08:41,459
Do the servants know Peter's here?

850
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,892
Yes,but I told them
he's here a long while

851
01:08:43,893 --> 01:08:45,914
Everything is turning out for the best

852
01:08:45,915 --> 01:08:48,396
And that brings me now,
to a fantastic performance

853
01:08:48,397 --> 01:08:51,314
I believe I will consult a doctor now

854
01:08:51,315 --> 01:08:55,641
A doctor?
- Yes,a psychiatrist,a pretty clever one..

855
01:08:55,642 --> 01:08:58,562
That is,one who believes
in his own shrewdness

856
01:08:58,563 --> 01:09:01,940
Goodnight
- Goodnight

857
01:09:08,662 --> 01:09:10,598
Oh you, Mr Burke..

858
01:09:10,599 --> 01:09:13,793
Sorry to disturb you so late,but I must
see your husband

859
01:09:13,794 --> 01:09:15,199
Yes, please come in

860
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,962
Scotland Yard,in the middle of the night?

861
01:09:17,963 --> 01:09:20,315
Yes,I'm playing a theatrical
detective, doctor

862
01:09:20,925 --> 01:09:24,520
I've been wanting to act like
a television private eye,

863
01:09:24,521 --> 01:09:26,121
but I hardly get the chance

864
01:09:26,122 --> 01:09:31,361
Sorry, I've been working rather late
My head aches awfully

865
01:09:31,362 --> 01:09:34,944
I have the feeling doctor,that tomorrow,
there will be a headache epidemic

866
01:09:34,945 --> 01:09:39,347
Yes,that poor Peter Clifton,
and Mrs Clifton,and Inspector Rouper,

867
01:09:39,348 --> 01:09:42,900
And you too,doctor
- I hope not

868
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:44,749
You better clear that up,
come in

869
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,294
This'll be man to man my dear

870
01:09:46,295 --> 01:09:51,151
Ah,modern art..
Here's where you treat your victims?

871
01:09:51,152 --> 01:09:55,541
You have a spoecial sense of humour
May I get you a drink,whisky?

872
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:56,925
No thank you..

873
01:09:56,926 --> 01:10:01,698
I believe there's an admirable quotation
on the subject from Kipling,no?

874
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:05,824
Accept the first drink,or something..
- Fine...

875
01:10:05,825 --> 01:10:08,162
Who are you after,and for what?

876
01:10:08,163 --> 01:10:11,492
I haven't decided,
I haven't selected the quarry

877
01:10:11,493 --> 01:10:13,787
But I'll soon pick on someone

878
01:10:14,356 --> 01:10:16,507
You must have heard that,

879
01:10:16,508 --> 01:10:21,115
an old lawyer was murdered
- Radlowe murdered?

880
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:23,388
I mentioned Radlowe then?

881
01:10:23,389 --> 01:10:26,522
I merely said that an old lawyer
was killed,why Radlowe?

882
01:10:26,523 --> 01:10:29,352
Well, I.. I know that he's Peter's lawyer

883
01:10:29,353 --> 01:10:31,794
Yes, I heard them talking
on the phone,yesterday

884
01:10:31,795 --> 01:10:33,531
Peter was to go and meet him

885
01:10:33,940 --> 01:10:37,259
Yes Doctor, Radlowe is the
lawyer who was murdered

886
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:39,153
Stabbed by someone unknown

887
01:10:39,154 --> 01:10:43,761
The murderer was seen by a neighbour,
who gave us a complete description

888
01:10:43,762 --> 01:10:46,035
A neighbour saw him you say?

889
01:10:46,036 --> 01:10:48,924
Yes that's right
A bit of luck eh?

890
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:51,232
You might say I came,

891
01:10:51,233 --> 01:10:54,298
to avoid the possibilities
of stories that would put

892
01:10:54,299 --> 01:10:58,771
Peter near Radlowe's office last night
- Yes Radlowe, it's awful

893
01:10:59,209 --> 01:11:01,683
When and where did Peter leave you?

894
01:11:01,684 --> 01:11:05,671
I would say we both left about 7 or so

895
01:11:05,672 --> 01:11:11,631
He went to Radlowe
- And you think,he's the murderer?

896
01:11:11,632 --> 01:11:15,691
No,you mustn't have heard that
I've said that,don't believe it!

897
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:21,533
That is,now that you say it,
I'm not so sure...

898
01:11:21,534 --> 01:11:24,992
Don't worry doctor,
when we find the stiletto,

899
01:11:24,993 --> 01:11:28,387
we'll have an easy time
finding the murderer

900
01:11:30,298 --> 01:11:32,311
You see,as a rule,the classic murderer,

901
01:11:32,312 --> 01:11:33,522
doesn't leave evidence
at the scene,

902
01:11:33,523 --> 01:11:36,521
unless he uses it to throw
suspicion on another

903
01:11:36,522 --> 01:11:38,291
Sometimes a cigarette case is left too,

904
01:11:38,292 --> 01:11:42,577
so idiots like me will think
the man who owns it is a murderer

905
01:11:42,578 --> 01:11:47,571
Yes, I have no idea
what I can do for you

906
01:11:47,572 --> 01:11:49,664
Well...

907
01:11:52,701 --> 01:11:54,403
You know Peter had been doped,

908
01:11:54,404 --> 01:11:57,314
you prefer to use morphine
in these cases?

909
01:11:57,315 --> 01:12:00,661
Are you accusing me of drugging Peter?
- I haven't mentioned that

910
01:12:00,662 --> 01:12:04,856
I mean that you've been acting not
as Peter's friend,but for yourself

911
01:12:04,857 --> 01:12:06,385
So, I think only of myself?

912
01:12:06,583 --> 01:12:11,309
So what if I told you Peter
confessed Hale's murder to me?

913
01:12:12,985 --> 01:12:14,135
What would you do?

914
01:12:14,136 --> 01:12:16,299
I would arrest you on the spot..
- Me?

915
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:19,653
And if I might add,what charge?

916
01:12:19,654 --> 01:12:21,276
Among other things,

917
01:12:21,277 --> 01:12:24,864
I would charge you with using
a false banknote deliberately

918
01:12:24,865 --> 01:12:27,021
Oh but, that note was Peter's

919
01:12:27,022 --> 01:12:31,167
I would further accuse you of
violating your oath as a doctor

920
01:12:31,955 --> 01:12:37,856
Chief Inspector,you don't
know what you're saying

921
01:12:37,857 --> 01:12:40,418
I do Mr Wells..
I know what I say..

922
01:12:40,419 --> 01:12:43,691
And I warn you,
leave Peter Clifton alone

923
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:47,919
If you plan to rob him of his millions,
just forget it

924
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,026
You were in Longford Castle
when Basil Hale was murdered

925
01:12:51,027 --> 01:12:53,885
And you...
- I was in Longford Castle,yes,

926
01:12:53,886 --> 01:12:56,614
but I haven't left my house since!

927
01:12:56,615 --> 01:12:58,231
Admitted..

928
01:12:59,935 --> 01:13:01,703
but before that,where were you?

929
01:13:01,704 --> 01:13:05,248
Where were you between
Longford Castle and your home?

930
01:13:06,063 --> 01:13:07,583
You're beaten Wells...

931
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:10,206
even cigarettes that Peter doesn't use,

932
01:13:10,207 --> 01:13:13,638
and false notebooks by the forger,
wont be enough for you

933
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:17,046
Somebody will pay for the murders,
you can be sure of that,

934
01:13:17,047 --> 01:13:19,038
but not Peter Clifton

935
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:20,981
Goodnight

936
01:13:41,554 --> 01:13:45,477
Where am I?
- At home

937
01:13:46,638 --> 01:13:48,286
At home...

938
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:51,126
Can you imagine how interesting it is,

939
01:13:51,127 --> 01:13:54,549
to have a husband who can't remember
what bed he's sleeping in?

940
01:13:58,773 --> 01:14:04,021
It seems quite difficult to be my wife.
- But it grows on you

941
01:14:08,232 --> 01:14:10,485
Jane...

942
01:14:14,113 --> 01:14:15,936
Don't underestimate Burke,

943
01:14:15,937 --> 01:14:17,916
he collects evidence 'till he's sure

944
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:19,771
Then he strikes suddenly,
like an explosion

945
01:14:19,772 --> 01:14:22,244
At Scotland Yard he's known as the bomb

946
01:14:22,245 --> 01:14:24,696
If he's protecting Peter Clifton then,

947
01:14:24,697 --> 01:14:27,107
I'm sure the murderers
name is in his hands.

948
01:14:27,108 --> 01:14:28,841
It makes me nervous doctor

949
01:14:28,842 --> 01:14:31,795
Oh don't act like a child,Rouper,
why are so worried?

950
01:14:31,796 --> 01:14:34,184
To the best of your knowledge
you did your duty

951
01:14:34,185 --> 01:14:35,678
What do you mean?

952
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:38,542
I simply did what ever
you told me should be done

953
01:14:38,543 --> 01:14:41,054
You told me Clifton
murdered Hale, and more..

954
01:14:41,055 --> 01:14:42,735
That you saw him in bed,
all covered with blood

955
01:14:42,736 --> 01:14:44,406
And his bloody clothes
were in his London home

956
01:14:44,407 --> 01:14:46,262
And there I would easily find them

957
01:14:46,263 --> 01:14:47,703
And furthermore,you announced,

958
01:14:47,704 --> 01:14:50,625
that in his safe I would find
a very interesting notebook

959
01:14:50,626 --> 01:14:52,786
But nothing seems to be true at all

960
01:14:52,787 --> 01:14:56,218
Why don't you tell Scotland Yard
that Clifton is an assassin?

961
01:14:56,219 --> 01:14:58,176
I can still do it

962
01:14:58,177 --> 01:14:59,652
What's that you say?

963
01:15:00,815 --> 01:15:04,189
Mrs Anderson thinks Peter Clifton,
the forger and Mr blonberg

964
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:05,701
Are one and the same person?

965
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:07,742
Yes,it's a fixed idea with her

966
01:15:10,115 --> 01:15:13,049
In her closet,she has a loaded
revolver hidden away

967
01:15:17,056 --> 01:15:22,456
Leith,ah, doctor Donald Wells
Well what happened?

968
01:15:22,457 --> 01:15:24,917
Yes,I spoke to Jane but

969
01:15:24,918 --> 01:15:29,240
But it wont be as easy to carry
out the big plan, as we figured

970
01:15:29,241 --> 01:15:31,323
Yes,oh sure good,

971
01:15:31,324 --> 01:15:34,652
suppose that you can,
bring Peter arround to commit himself,

972
01:15:34,653 --> 01:15:35,855
and turn his money over to Jane to manage it

973
01:15:35,856 --> 01:15:39,653
What then?
We must let Jane into the plan,naturally

974
01:15:39,654 --> 01:15:41,577
But she wont play along

975
01:15:41,578 --> 01:15:44,657
Something has happened
that we didn't think, would happen

976
01:15:44,658 --> 01:15:47,020
You see Peter's her husband.

977
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:52,703
Of course you can try that,
but don't get confident

978
01:15:52,704 --> 01:15:56,548
Your appeal to the ladies
is overrated Wells

979
01:15:58,434 --> 01:16:02,719
Anderson wants to avenge her son,
by shooting Peter Clifton dead

980
01:16:03,507 --> 01:16:05,492
Shall I take the revolver away?

981
01:16:07,608 --> 01:16:09,341
Let the Chief decide...

982
01:16:26,961 --> 01:16:32,467
Good afternoon
- Good afternoon

983
01:16:32,468 --> 01:16:34,553
How's Peter?
Asleep..

984
01:16:34,554 --> 01:16:38,049
So, I must say,I'm glad I can see you alone
- Please...

985
01:16:38,803 --> 01:16:41,336
It was an awful thing last night

986
01:16:41,337 --> 01:16:43,633
You mean Radlowe?
- I mean Radlowe..

987
01:16:43,634 --> 01:16:47,061
Then you believe that,
Peter is involved?

988
01:16:47,871 --> 01:16:49,025
Listen Jane...

989
01:16:50,674 --> 01:16:54,732
The fact is,that now it's
essential that Peter,

990
01:16:54,733 --> 01:16:58,907
for himself,and in your interests too,
have to face the truth

991
01:16:58,908 --> 01:17:02,804
He will always have his trouble mentally

992
01:17:02,805 --> 01:17:07,055
I'm afraid that the truth about these
murders will come out some day

993
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:11,891
that would lead to a terrible public trial
Truly it would be a scandal

994
01:17:11,892 --> 01:17:17,299
You would suffer for it too
So I think that its for the best

995
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:23,011
That Peter does something to avoid it

996
01:17:23,012 --> 01:17:24,424
What do you suggest?

997
01:17:24,425 --> 01:17:28,391
Jane, first both Peter and you,

998
01:17:28,392 --> 01:17:31,214
must believe, I have just
your best interests at heart

999
01:17:31,215 --> 01:17:33,045
And then?
- Yes then,

1000
01:17:33,046 --> 01:17:37,408
Peter must get an encompetance hearing

1001
01:17:37,409 --> 01:17:41,487
So that he will be declared
insane and confined

1002
01:17:41,488 --> 01:17:42,849
It's not really so shocking..

1003
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:46,673
He'll be confined for maybe
a total of 5 maybe 6 years

1004
01:17:46,674 --> 01:17:50,049
In other words,Peter should
declare himself insane

1005
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:55,603
Just a formality,and we'll do it quietly
It's the only way

1006
01:17:55,604 --> 01:17:58,038
Jane.. you understand that under the law

1007
01:17:58,039 --> 01:17:59,769
you would manage his fortune,
and if you wish

1008
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:01,915
you can decide to call on your uncle,

1009
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:07,514
or... or me.. as trustee,as you wish,
you must not ignore this

1010
01:18:07,515 --> 01:18:10,414
Jane.. your own social standing in London

1011
01:18:10,415 --> 01:18:14,631
As the wife of a sentenced murderer,

1012
01:18:15,574 --> 01:18:16,870
you would be an outcast...

1013
01:18:16,871 --> 01:18:21,044
So you say it's an absolute fact,
that Peter is mentally ill?

1014
01:18:21,045 --> 01:18:25,319
Yes,all the symptoms speak for it

1015
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:28,326
Its evident when he talks,
he's constantly blinking

1016
01:18:28,327 --> 01:18:29,694
his entire behaviour..

1017
01:18:29,695 --> 01:18:33,516
These symptoms,would any
specialist recognise them?

1018
01:18:33,517 --> 01:18:35,006
Yes of course

1019
01:18:37,854 --> 01:18:41,201
For example,
Sir George Galthom or Dr Heinrich Strauss?

1020
01:18:41,202 --> 01:18:42,421
Naturally..

1021
01:18:42,422 --> 01:18:44,010
Such great doctors
are very busy people

1022
01:18:44,011 --> 01:18:47,957
And also the great neuro psychiatrist,
Sir Frederick Jackson?

1023
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:49,136
Yes,without doubt

1024
01:18:49,137 --> 01:18:51,907
But jane,we can't afford
to let too many others

1025
01:18:51,908 --> 01:18:54,203
in on the murders that are involved

1026
01:18:54,829 --> 01:18:57,351
I've been playing a little game Dr Wells

1027
01:18:57,352 --> 01:19:01,394
The 3 doctors that I've been talking about,
came today for tea

1028
01:19:01,395 --> 01:19:04,581
And they have tested Peter,
and talked with him

1029
01:19:04,582 --> 01:19:06,749
And each of these 3 doctors assured me

1030
01:19:06,750 --> 01:19:10,157
that Peter is just as sane
as anyone can be

1031
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:12,232
But,but it doesn't make sense

1032
01:19:12,233 --> 01:19:13,996
They're all mistaken obviously,

1033
01:19:13,997 --> 01:19:15,687
since Professor Cloors...
- Is a charlatan

1034
01:19:15,688 --> 01:19:18,959
that you brought in to help
put Peter in an institution

1035
01:19:20,939 --> 01:19:23,549
I'm on to your tricks Dr wells

1036
01:19:23,896 --> 01:19:25,574
I don't understand..

1037
01:19:25,575 --> 01:19:27,912
Now I would appreciate it
if you would get out of here

1038
01:19:28,109 --> 01:19:29,919
Dr Wells wants to leave..

1039
01:19:30,718 --> 01:19:33,724
I'll go of course,
if that's what you want

1040
01:19:33,725 --> 01:19:38,197
But I hope Jane,
you wont be sorry later on

1041
01:19:38,198 --> 01:19:40,151
I wont be too sorry

1042
01:19:41,925 --> 01:19:42,649
What's that?

1043
01:19:43,504 --> 01:19:48,590
Liverpool versus Glasgow,
the game is still nil... nil

1044
01:19:48,591 --> 01:19:50,108
The plates complete the case...
We can arrest,

1045
01:19:50,109 --> 01:19:52,343
Peter Clifton as the forger

1046
01:19:52,344 --> 01:19:56,256
That's excellent,why that's great

1047
01:19:56,257 --> 01:20:00,870
We just arrest the fellow,
and tomorrow I watch the kings cup game

1048
01:20:00,871 --> 01:20:02,645
The police searching Longford Castle

1049
01:20:02,646 --> 01:20:07,518
found the missing press,and the plates,
in the pond,right behind the park

1050
01:20:07,519 --> 01:20:09,015
The report is completely written up

1051
01:20:09,016 --> 01:20:13,176
Yes,I hope you didn't forget to mention
that in Longford castle,

1052
01:20:13,177 --> 01:20:15,022
a tremendous amount of
forged money was made

1053
01:20:15,023 --> 01:20:17,296
Thank you,
I put it down already

1054
01:20:17,297 --> 01:20:19,186
The 20 five pound notes,

1055
01:20:19,187 --> 01:20:21,938
you picked up last sunday from Dr wells
were probably genuine,

1056
01:20:21,939 --> 01:20:24,046
or the bank wouldn't
have accepted them

1057
01:20:24,047 --> 01:20:27,086
I have no idea what you mean
- I'll be glad to explain

1058
01:20:27,087 --> 01:20:28,698
You're under arrest Rouper!

1059
01:20:31,418 --> 01:20:34,895
You can't do this!
Let me go

1060
01:20:39,196 --> 01:20:40,634
One... Nil

1061
01:20:41,972 --> 01:20:45,126
So Burke is after you,
are you surprised about that?

1062
01:20:45,127 --> 01:20:46,926
My orders were to fake Hale's death

1063
01:20:46,927 --> 01:20:48,783
And you had no order from me to kill Radlowe

1064
01:20:48,784 --> 01:20:52,261
You know I hate violence,
look at the Consequences

1065
01:20:52,262 --> 01:20:54,941
What has been done,
can not be changed

1066
01:20:54,942 --> 01:20:58,160
I must get away,and right now too
- I'm not keeping you

1067
01:20:58,161 --> 01:21:00,633
I need cash
- You're a rich man

1068
01:21:00,634 --> 01:21:04,258
But an hour ago,
my wife took everything and left

1069
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:05,692
I need your help...

1070
01:21:05,693 --> 01:21:08,100
And what about your fine plan with Clifton?

1071
01:21:08,101 --> 01:21:09,429
Listen Blonberg...

1072
01:21:09,430 --> 01:21:14,163
let me down now,
and I will not go down alone,understand?

1073
01:21:14,164 --> 01:21:16,447
I didn't say I wouldn't help you,

1074
01:21:16,448 --> 01:21:18,894
how much do you need?
Five thousand pounds?

1075
01:21:18,895 --> 01:21:23,113
Very well,come here at about eleven P.M
Someone will be waiting

1076
01:21:23,114 --> 01:21:24,403
Can't I come sooner?

1077
01:21:24,404 --> 01:21:29,263
No,you will be here at eleven,someone will
be here to meet you with the money

1078
01:21:29,264 --> 01:21:32,440
You must tell that person that
you are Blonberg,is that clear?

1079
01:21:32,441 --> 01:21:36,072
Good, I'll do whatever you want

1080
01:21:37,749 --> 01:21:40,495
Now, you know what to do Henry?
- I do Sir

1081
01:21:40,496 --> 01:21:43,770
And tell the distributers they will
get new merchandise in 8 days

1082
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:46,074
100 Deutsche Mark notes
- I will Sir

1083
01:21:46,799 --> 01:21:51,462
This is Blonberg,tell Mrs Anderson
I want to speak to her here at 11 pm

1084
01:21:52,247 --> 01:21:55,171
Glad you're feeling better Peter
- Thank you Burke

1085
01:21:55,172 --> 01:21:57,505
Doesn't he look well?
- Indeed he does

1086
01:21:57,506 --> 01:22:00,695
I want you to hear this,
It was saved by Radlowe

1087
01:22:00,696 --> 01:22:03,569
On top it says without name change,the text

1088
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:06,809
Mrs Alexander Wellerson,
that was your mother

1089
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:11,137
was married to a man who by chance,
was her first husbands cousin

1090
01:22:11,138 --> 01:22:14,657
Mrs and Mr Wellerson,
that's your stepfather...

1091
01:22:14,658 --> 01:22:17,017
accompanied by their
seven month old child,

1092
01:22:17,018 --> 01:22:19,047
who was of the first marriage,
that's you Peter

1093
01:22:19,048 --> 01:22:20,638
Took a revierra trip..

1094
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:26,065
Yes,but that means that...

1095
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:28,923
That the Wellerson who murdered 2 people

1096
01:22:28,924 --> 01:22:31,144
and finally ended up in dartmoor to die,

1097
01:22:31,145 --> 01:22:34,130
was not your father at all..
- But only your stepfather

1098
01:22:34,131 --> 01:22:35,547
Who married Anderson later,

1099
01:22:35,548 --> 01:22:38,001
without benefit of divorcing his wife,
your real mother

1100
01:22:38,002 --> 01:22:41,965
Now then,the forger.. who is he?

1101
01:22:44,943 --> 01:22:48,399
You know him?
- I know him

1102
01:22:48,748 --> 01:22:50,842
You know where he could be hiding?

1103
01:22:51,396 --> 01:22:56,762
I know at least,where that so called,
Blonberg works

1104
01:22:56,763 --> 01:23:00,370
Where he'll meet contacts,
even tonight

1105
01:23:11,317 --> 01:23:14,144
That is all,I must go now

1106
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:58,680
Blonberg 1,Blonberg 1
Do you hear me?

1107
01:23:59,531 --> 01:24:03,909
He went in just now,
be sure you're ready..

1108
01:24:35,147 --> 01:24:36,548
Are you there Blonberg?

1109
01:24:36,549 --> 01:24:38,175
Have you brought the cash?
Let's have it,quick

1110
01:24:38,176 --> 01:24:40,296
Money,you want money?

1111
01:24:40,297 --> 01:24:43,487
after you murdered your brother
in cold blood Peter Clifton

1112
01:24:43,488 --> 01:24:44,488
Murderer!

1113
01:24:44,489 --> 01:24:47,331
You dirty bloody murderer
Blonberg or Clifton

1114
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:49,956
You're crazy,I'm not Clifton!

1115
01:24:49,957 --> 01:24:50,957
Murderer!

1116
01:25:43,918 --> 01:25:45,042
All is clear..

1117
01:25:46,087 --> 01:25:50,187
And if he doesn't come,what then?
- He's coming,no doubt at all

1118
01:26:52,091 --> 01:26:57,183
Halt!
It's too late, Peter Clifton

1119
01:26:58,802 --> 01:27:03,018
Peter!
Peter!

1120
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:06,430
What have you done Peter?

1121
01:27:06,431 --> 01:27:08,525
Nothing,
nothing at all

1122
01:27:08,526 --> 01:27:13,176
He wanted to do something,
but he didn't succeed

1123
01:27:13,177 --> 01:27:15,834
The lift signal,he's coming!
- Lights out!

1124
01:27:49,859 --> 01:27:51,636
Don't make a foolish move!
- Uncle John!

1125
01:27:51,637 --> 01:27:56,775
Mr Leith,or Mr Blonberg,
or the forger...

1126
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:06,440
It's unfortunate Peter

1127
01:28:06,441 --> 01:28:08,497
I'm aware that you
tried to warn Leith

1128
01:28:08,498 --> 01:28:10,529
so that Jane might
not have been hurt

1129
01:28:13,259 --> 01:28:15,604
Marjorie told me where to find Uncle John

1130
01:28:15,605 --> 01:28:19,162
Peter,you knew?
- Yes Jane

1131
01:28:19,163 --> 01:28:23,459
That time at Longford Castle when
I found the forgery hidden away

1132
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:26,319
And the plate that I'd loaned
a while ago to Uncle John

1133
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,186
he pretended was lost

1134
01:29:09,637 --> 01:29:10,556
What's going on?

1135
01:29:10,557 --> 01:29:13,349
Excuse me please,
it was a goal for our side

1136
01:29:13,843 --> 01:29:16,583
Well I'm cheering for our team too

1137
01:29:17,335 --> 01:29:18,631
Oh Chief Inspector

1138
01:29:18,632 --> 01:29:21,451
Tell me,how did that
case come out then?

1139
01:29:21,452 --> 01:29:24,009
The best my friend,the best
