1
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,060
Parou~

2
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Morning!

3
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,310
Time for lunch!

4
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,180
Eat your food.

5
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:20,500
Cat cafe

6
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:20,500
Translated, timed and subbed by Rjgman56.

7
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,290
People with a ton of different tastes and hobbies have gathered around.

8
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,380
Akihabara is a city in Japan where you can enjoy food and all kinds of hobbies.

9
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,910
In this city there are customers who like to be consoled and surrounded by cats.

10
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:40,390
There is a cat cafe that will hopefully improve their mood and put a smile on their face.

11
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,240
The name of that cafe is Mocha!

12
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:51,380
People who are burdened with worries can be consoled here.

13
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,690
It is a warm place.

14
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,340
This person is Yamagoto-san.

15
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,530
He's a master at cat play.

16
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,990
He wears a military outfit all the time and is the store manager of a neighborhood store.

17
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,500
This is Yumi-san.

18
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,980
Because Akihabara is on the way to work...

19
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,710
She comes here to have fun and play around.

20
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,920
Her job is...

21
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,530
A secret!

22
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,720
The older cats are always doing things at their own pace.

23
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:39,580
It seems like cats who act like this are popular.

24
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,660
He is in his twenties but a manager of a company.

25
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,590
He is an elite businessman named Aizawa-san.

26
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,960
And the store manager of this new cafe is me.

27
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,560
Sakuragi Sakura.

28
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,360
It's a little bit different than the job I wanted to do since I was a kid but...

29
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,410
This place right now is my special place.

30
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,600
Being surrounded by a lot of unique customers and cats..

31
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,520
Makes everyday so fulfilling.

32
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,550
It seems like we are going to have a new encounter again today.

33
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,390
I'm interested in that cat.

34
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,600
Is this your first time?

35
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,220
Yes!

36
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,290
Is there any cat you're interested in?

37
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,230
No..well...not yet...

38
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,100
Even if the cats are a similar color...

39
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,000
They all have very different personalities depending on which one you pick.

40
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,980
Is that right?

41
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,030
Yes!

42
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,860
For example!

43
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,230
This cat is a British shorthair named Puri-chan!

44
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,350
She's our store's number one cat!

45
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,630
Puri?

46
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,240
It's a cute name.

47
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,250
That's right!

48
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,700
It's hard to tell the difference when she wants to do something or she doesn't want to.

49
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,500
She's a total Tsundere but she's such a sweetie that she has a ton of fans.

50
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,380
You have a lot of fans?

51
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,040
Are you okay?

52
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,130
Sorry about that!

53
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,140
But...I have to go now..

54
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,430
I'll come again.

55
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,610
Okay!

56
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,910
Please come again.

57
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,520
I'll be waiting for you!

58
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,680
Is something wrong?

59
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,120
Well..

60
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,100
That girl...

61
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,610
An idol?

62
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,620
I don't know too much about them but..

63
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,010
If I'm not mistaken, I believe she is from the idol girl group called Hoshikuzu Shoujo.

64
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,550
It's just that she's not a very popular member from the group.

65
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,600
There's always been rumors that she's going to retire.

66
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,930
Thank you so much!

67
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,020
Thanks as always!

68
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,120
Thank you!

69
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,310
I think it would be better if you smiled a little bit more.

70
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,180
Yes, thank you.

71
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,020
Really? That makes me happy!!

72
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,300
Then come again tomorrow! Thanks!

73
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,040
Thanks!

74
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,180
Is that right? You dyed it red?

75
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,440
Then shall we dye it red together?

76
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,350
It looks really good on you!

77
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,750
Is it okay for you not to be over there?

78
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,570
Well..it's fine for today.

79
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,040
Sometimes we want to be your fans too.

80
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,230
Thanks.

81
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,760
Besides...you know?

82
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,570
Well..you see Shiho-chan...

83
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,600
How do I say this?

84
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,960
She talks to us from there with a smile on her face but..

85
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,970
She's not really that good at starting conversations.

86
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,880
It's kinda like...every time we go over there she can't really think of anything to talk about.

87
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,930
Is that right?

88
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,850
But I'm glad that you came.

89
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,150
Come again okay?

90
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,120
Thanks!

91
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,680
Thanks! Bye! Bye!

92
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,360
Later!

93
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,430
Thanks!

94
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,740
It seems like the underground idol Shiho Namiki-sama skipped on cleaning duties again today~

95
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,740
Seriously? She can't help sell so she should just quit already.

96
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
She's already being punished by staying in the group. LOL.

97
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,740
Just quit!

98
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,740
I've seen a live video before but there weren't that many people there. LOL.

99
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,740
I think I saw that video too. Namiki wasn't really popular at all.

100
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,460
I'm home!

101
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,440
Welcome home.

102
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,810
Where's your friend?

103
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,310
She went to go get Shouta.

104
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,880
Oh, is that right?

105
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,990
What about dinner?

106
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,530
It's okay. I already ate.

107
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,110
Are you dancing and jumping around like always?

108
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,480
There's a lot of idols these days aren't there?

109
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,020
Pretty much.

110
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,680
What are you going to do after you graduate high school?

111
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,000
Is that really going to supply you money?

112
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,030
I don't know.

113
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,210
You don't know? This is about you.

114
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,230
It's fine to chase after your dreams but...

115
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,820
Wouldn't it be better to think about something more realistic?

116
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,150
One, two, three, four!

117
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,370
Should we try out another pose?

118
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,370
Ready..set...

119
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,060
One, two, three, four..

120
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,840
Just like that!

121
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,420
One more time.

122
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,780
Five, six, seven, eight!

123
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,320
Shiho!

124
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,820
Are you doing a proper job?

125
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,990
Your fans that came over to me won't always do that!

126
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,760
Sorry...

127
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,300
I don't want you to apologize.

128
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,690
During our handshakes with fans...

129
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:21,250
Don't just stand there but show our fans a good time!

130
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,670
Are you even giving it any thought?

131
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,750
That's enough!

132
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,400
Shiho is doing her best...

133
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,490
Doing her best? She's just causing fans to leave!

134
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,350
Yui!

135
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,090
I want to make Hoshikuzu Shoujo more popular!

136
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,750
In order to do that...

137
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,090
Everyone feels the same way!

138
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,620
That's why we're pushing ourselves...

139
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,530
When has she ever pushed herself?

140
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,490
How is Shiho going to grow if she just stands there and does nothing?

141
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:48,600
Yui!

142
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,080
It's fine! Just leave her alone.

143
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,000
But...

144
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,820
What the heck?

145
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,350
Now then, we have the last song coming right up!

146
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,200
Umm...

147
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,490
What is it?

148
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,010
I have a little announcement to make.

149
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,850
Umm...

150
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,540
I..Namiki Shiho...

151
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,640
I'll retire as an idol this month.

152
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,450
What's the meaning of this?

153
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,020
I've already made up my mind.

154
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,290
Are you being serious?

155
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,420
Aren't you being a little too hard on yourself?

156
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,910
I'm not popular anyways!

157
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,210
It will be the same if I'm not there.

158
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,070
Wakana.

159
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,350
Is it okay for you not to pick that up?

160
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,590
Yes...

161
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,670
I'm a little tired.

162
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,330
There's days like that too huh?

163
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,610
It must be nice to be popular...

164
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,360
But this cat is actually a very hard worker.

165
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,560
Well...maybe it's a black cat...

166
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,560
Translator note: Kuronin means hardworker and Kuro means black. It's a wordplay.

167
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,090
A black cat?

168
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,390
When this cat first came here it became popular very quickly but...

169
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,830
All of the other cats were jealous of her.

170
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,570
They were jealous?

171
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,250
That happens too?

172
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,080
It does.

173
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,200
It happens.

174
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,930
In the cat world as well.

175
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,360
They get a little outcasted from their comrades.

176
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,560
They get outcasted?

177
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,000
But Puri is strong!

178
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,270
And she never lost herself!

179
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,280
After that she started to gain friends slowly but surely.

180
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,940
I'm not strong like that.

181
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,500
I'm sorry! Did I do something to...

182
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,990
It's me!

183
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,850
Just quit! Unpopular idol.

184
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,050
I think I'm worthless.

185
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,050
I shouldn't be a partner to those girls..

186
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,550
But...

187
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:55,140
Whether it's in my house or at my company...

188
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,270
It doesn't matter where. I don't have anyone on my side...

189
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,270
There are times when I can't endure that.

190
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,690
There's not a single person I can tell this too.

191
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,950
Thanks for telling me this.

192
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,770
Do you feel relieved?

193
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,750
Puri?

194
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,790
What's wrong?

195
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,550
She's saying "You're not alone!"

196
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,580
She's helping you cheer me up.

197
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,890
Thanks Puri.

198
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,800
If you're with me then everything is okay huh?

199
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,460
Puri.

200
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,560
Thank you for today.

201
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,510
Not at all. I didn't do anything.

202
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,660
I felt like you were pushing me forward.

203
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,600
I'm glad.

204
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,210
First, I'm going to tell the other members my true feelings.

205
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,990
That's right.

206
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,910
Yeah!

207
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,020
Sensei!

208
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,660
Sakura sensei!

209
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,540
I'll see you again sensei!

210
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,680
I'm sorry!

211
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,980
Do you really want to quit?

212
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,010
Then why?

213
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,290
Show me your smartphone.

214
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,960
Just do it!

215
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,950
You're always looking at your smartphone with a scared look.

216
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,040
I thought that it might be this.

217
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,610
Yui...

218
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,790
Shiho!

219
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,520
There's no need for you to be in the same room as the people who throw stones at you!

220
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:28,830
Umm...at the last live I made a retirement announcement but...

221
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,760
Please let me take it back!

222
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:43,360
I want to continue being an idol with these members!

223
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,420
Please take care of me!

224
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,340
Now then...let us all get fired up together!

225
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,970
Please listen to...

226
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,580
"Sun! Sun! Sun!"

227
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,390
The sky that you can see...

228
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:57,380
Has no limits to it's height.

229
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:04,390
We used to look at the blue sky all the time in the past.

230
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,870
Under the hot sunshine..

231
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:13,250
We had our backs pressed together underneath the sunshine.

232
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:20,010
We couldn't handle this hot summer day.

233
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,150
We don't want these days to stop.

234
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,040
We don't want this excitement to stop.

235
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:34,190
We have no choice but to jump.

236
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,490
Boom! Boom! Boom!

237
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,760
Just like a gun..

238
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,440
Up! Up! Up!

239
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,730
Shoot for the sky!

240
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,330
We have a smile on our faces.

241
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:47,160
Our dreams will for sure come true in the future.

242
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,940
We aren't going to stop!

243
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,010
Sun! Sun! Sun!

244
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:53,230
Our high expectations.

245
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,170
Sun! Sun! Sun!

246
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:59,750
Someone will come and be the light in our life.

247
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,900
It's all going to start from here.

248
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,340
We are connected to our future right now...

249
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,990
Just like a bird in the sky.

250
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,060
Puri!

251
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,010
Thanks for the other day.

252
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,430
She's hard to catch.

253
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,330
This one is cute too.

254
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,270
You're right...

255
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,360
So cute!

256
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,300
He's a cutie right?

257
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,480
So cute...

258
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:07,020
Everyone may not cheer you on.

259
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,400
There are times where you worry or stop in a standstill.

260
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:19,730
But if you change your perspective a little bit then there should be people who are there to support you.

261
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,810
And the person who ends up supporting you is your biggest fan.

262
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:50,900
Sometimes I get very curious on how the cat's memory works.

263
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:57,420
How much do they remember me and the guests?

264
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,150
I'm always observing them but I don't see too much.

265
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,480
They are unable to speak.

266
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,450
How is the fish?

267
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,360
Is it yummy?

268
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,150
It's yummy isn't it?

269
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,900
The cat who carries memories.

270
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,540
Sayo-san.

271
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,560
Are you off work?

272
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,400
Yes!

273
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,810
I haven't seen you around lately and so I got worried.

274
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,470
I'm sorry.

275
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,940
I've been a little bit busy.

276
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:46,920
Is that right?

277
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:52,950
Please don't push yourself too much.

278
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,800
When you're not around, Goumon gets lonely.

279
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,790
Thanks.

280
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:21,450
Day service Chiyoda.

281
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,920
That will be 2000 yen.

282
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:27,170
I'm sorry. I'll come again!

283
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,070
Yes!

284
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:40,080
I'm sorry...

285
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,880
She suddenly called someone a thief while she was going on a walk..

286
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,500
And then she started swinging her cane at them.

287
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,290
I'm sorry for causing trouble...

288
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:56,040
Thank goodness that the person who was walking didn't get hurt but...

289
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,030
If she gets too violent we won't be able to care for her anymore.

290
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:09,970
Sayo! Are you there?

291
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,620
I'm coming right now so wait right there!

292
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,790
That's how it is.

293
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,240
Thank you!

294
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,620
Sayo!

295
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,600
Are you there?

296
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,470
Sayo!

297
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:38,920
Hurry up and take off my shoes!

298
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,710
My feet are so sore!

299
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,260
Very very very sore!

300
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,650
I'll massage them afterwards.

301
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,870
I'm very sorry to say this but your Mother's Alzheimer's is very advanced.

302
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:09,870
At this stage she will have plenty of delusions and mood disorders.

303
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:16,080
It is very important for her family to be kind to her and take proper care of her.

304
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:26,240
Please don't confuse her, get mad at her, or blame her.

305
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,750
This is no good!

306
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,820
I'm telling you to get away from me!

307
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,790
Hey, come on..what are you doing?

308
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,430
Stop it!

309
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,590
Be quiet!

310
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,250
Hey Mom..it's time for your bath!

311
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,730
Mom!

312
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,800
Stop it!

313
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,760
Open up!

314
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,040
Mom!

315
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:10,050
That's not the place where we are living!

316
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,410
Hey!

317
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,240
Who are you?

318
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:37,600
Is Sayo-san okay?

319
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,550
Hey Goumon..

320
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,050
Do you remember your parents?

321
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,700
He's so cute when he looks over here!

322
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,460
Mi! He's looking everywhere.

323
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,110
He's getting so big.

324
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,160
Mi! Mi-chan!

325
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,660
In the past...

326
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:42,710
I was always thinking about if I was reborn in a different household.

327
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,500
What don't you like?

328
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,790
What is causing you to do this?

329
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:22,150
Everyone in the daytime are a lot nicer than you!

330
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:33,190
Then why don't you just get out of this house?

331
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,140
I'm home!

332
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,460
Have you eaten dinner yet Mom?

333
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,770
Mom?

334
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,290
Mom?

335
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,670
Mom!

336
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,950
Sayo-san?

337
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,000
What's wrong?

338
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,390
I said something awful to her after all.

339
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,630
With cats, even if they get into fights...

340
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,190
They will get along again and sleep together in 10 minutes.

341
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,880
I want to be able to get over things as fast as they do.

342
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,920
That sounds like something you would say.

343
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,170
Even if you got into a fight with your Mom...

344
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:57,650
I hope that she will be able to forget about it soon.

345
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:05,870
I wonder if I can be as kind as you are?

346
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,520
I don't understand my Mom anymore.

347
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,560
Mi?

348
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,020
I remembered something.

349
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,490
Mi?

350
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,620
Mi? Where are you?

351
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,050
My father used to have a really cute cat called Mi.

352
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:59,830
But after my father's funeral, he suddenly left the house.

353
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:07,010
And then when I was looking for Mi, I ended up getting lost.

354
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,980
Mi-chan was probably lonely huh?

355
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,080
After your dad passed away.

356
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:28,480
I wonder if your Mom left the house in the night with the same feelings as Mi-chan?

357
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,940
Is she looking for my father?

358
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,030
Mom? Are you there?

359
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,650
Mom!

360
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,030
Mom?

361
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,970
Mom?

362
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,780
Mom...

363
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,020
Is this place...

364
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,890
Sayo!

365
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:48,910
Mom...

366
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,420
Mi!

367
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,500
Mom...

368
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,720
Saiyo-chan.

369
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,750
Don't cry.

370
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:26,150
Look, I found Mi-chan.

371
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,550
Okay? Let's go back.

372
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:35,200
She wasn't looking for your father?

373
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,940
Were you looking for him this entire time for me?

374
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,510
Mom...

375
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,690
I'm sorry...

376
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,640
I was scared.

377
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,790
I was scared you would forget everything.

378
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,170
I was afraid you might forget me and Dad...

379
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,430
What are you looking at?

380
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,350
The sky?

381
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,110
He's looking at the sky!

382
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,310
There's clouds.

383
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,000
Can you see the sakura trees?

384
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,070
Mi...

385
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,460
Thanks...

386
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,720
Sayo-san!

387
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:21,920
Sakura-san!

388
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,920
Yukie-san.

389
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,120
Good afternoon.

390
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,390
We had a wonderful meal again today didn't we?

391
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,500
Yes, yes.

392
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,320
You always eat wonderful food.

393
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,360
She's not this calm everyday though.

394
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,570
From now on...when things get tough then tell me please.

395
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,520
Thanks.

396
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:53,850
Please bring Yukie-san with you the next time we go out shopping.

397
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,230
Sure!

398
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:57,650
Shall we go?

399
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:10,430
There are times when we remember things that we have forgotten about.

400
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:14,930
That is proof that we have lived.

401
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,850
The fun memories...

402
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,830
The sad memories...

403
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,070
I think that life is very abundant with both of these kinds of memories.

404
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:33,380
And I'm sure that what happened today will become a good memory for me.

405
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,270
There is a cat cafe in Akihabara called Mocha.

406
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:50,210
Regardless of someone's gender, nationality, age or occupation...

407
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:52,310
There are a ton of people who come here daily.

408
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,620
They come with various feelings to see these cats.

409
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:02,770
Most of them are cat lovers but..

410
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,760
Sometimes they aren't.

411
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,430
A spoiled kitty with blue eyes.

412
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,050
What's up with that guy?

413
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,930
He's just been sighing a lot...

414
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:45,120
He's a customer who has come here a lot though...

415
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,770
He kinda gives off some bad vibes...

416
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,690
I wonder if he knows that he is being a nuisance?

417
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,420
Is that how it is?

418
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,040
Then why is he here?

419
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,310
Recruiting people in their 30's and 40's.

420
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,060
This is Yoko. How are you? The other day you made a promise with Miku. I want you to decide on a day to fulfill that promise.

421
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,040
President Otegawa. 5th anniversary. Congratulations. From the company.

422
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,610
Yoko...

423
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,640
I finally found you.

424
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,380
Leave all the lawyer stuff to me.

425
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,620
That's right.

426
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:45,200
I don't want you to be bothered by all that stuff.

427
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,180
That's not a problem.

428
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:54,040
Later!

429
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:54,910
Hey...

430
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:57,460
Are you eating properly?

431
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,090
I'm not going to die. I'll make it work somehow.

432
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,570
You know what?

433
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,230
Miku is looking forward to seeing you.

434
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,400
You can set aside some time right?

435
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,100
I'm sorry.

436
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,140
Why are you sorry?

437
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:25,080
I don't plan on seeing Miku.

438
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:04,410
Umm!

439
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,740
How about we wear this together?

440
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,430
What the heck is that?

441
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,400
Ah! These are cat ears that you put on your head...

442
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,310
I can tell by looking at it!

443
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:25,050
Why do I have to wear something so stupid like that?

444
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:30,080
Because...you're always making such a scary face!

445
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,920
If you're having a hard time with the cats...

446
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,300
Then you need to make yourself look like a cat as well!

447
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,300
Stop spewing all of that nonsense!

448
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:50,340
That scared the hell out of me!

449
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,700
What the hell is wrong with you dumbass!?

450
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:54,770
Hey!

451
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,550
What's up with that attitude?

452
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,180
What's up with you?

453
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,670
I should be asking you that!

454
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,430
Why are you coming to a cat cafe and then abusing the cats?

455
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,140
Hold on! I apologize for that!

456
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:08,220
Like I said...What's up with you?

457
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:14,080
Umm..sir..how can I say this?

458
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:20,510
You are going to scare the cats with your behavior and attitude.

459
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,820
Cats are very sensitive creatures!

460
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:30,700
Voices and sounds that might not be a big deal to humans will scare the cats!

461
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:33,530
Are you saying that it's my fault?

462
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:36,030
Well...yes...

463
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:42,900
Aren't you pampering them too much?

464
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,810
All these kinds of sounds happen all the time!

465
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,550
If they are scared by something like this...

466
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,970
Then aren't you and the cats all sensitive weaklings?

467
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:55,060
That's not true...

468
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,660
Whatever!

469
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:01,950
What's up with that guy?

470
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:03,400
Umm...

471
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,660
It's you...

472
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:10,810
Here you go!

473
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:22,670
Did something happen?

474
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:56,300
What is this place?

475
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,370
This used to be my castle.

476
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:01,200
Half a year ago.

477
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,770
I divorced my wife.

478
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,010
I don't plan on seeing my daughter anymore.

479
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,450
I don't want to bother them or put any burdens on them.

480
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,620
Umm...can I ask you a question?

481
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,940
You're always looking at your smartphone aren't you?

482
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,810
What are you looking at?

483
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:28,850
Don't tell me...is voyeurism your hobby?

484
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,740
There's no way that's that true!

485
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,550
Then please prove your innocence!

486
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,500
So cute!

487
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,940
How old is she?

488
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,930
She's seven and a half years old.

489
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,980
Her name is Miku.

490
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,100
Miku-chan huh?

491
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,610
Miku seems to be obsessed with that cat.

492
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:26,400
She made a promise with me to go and see her one last time.

493
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,620
I plan on declining somehow.

494
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:36,120
I can't see my daughter for the last time and show her that I'm scared of cats...

495
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:40,910
Is that really all?

496
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:48,000
You don't want her to see your unsightly side?

497
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:54,260
Come with me!

498
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:55,260
What is it?

499
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:06,850
Hey..hey...what's going on?

500
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,510
You made a promise didn't you?

501
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:10,270
Yeah...

502
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:12,080
Then you need to keep it!

503
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:15,400
Not seeing her is going to make you look way more lame!

504
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:20,960
This kitty is called Hokomato.

505
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,860
It's the same kind of cat that Miku-chan has.

506
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,580
It is a ragdoll breed.

507
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,390
Ragdoll?

508
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:29,100
When people pick them up they are very relaxed or go limp.

509
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:33,260
They look just like stuffed animals so that's why they're called Ragdolls.

510
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,940
It's okay!

511
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:53,030
When I was a kid I got scratched by a cat...

512
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,810
It's not going to scratch you!

513
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,000
Here!

514
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,250
I'm going to wear this?

515
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:09,530
Yes!

516
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,480
In order to understand the feelings of a cat...you have to act like one.

517
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,040
You're making a scary face!

518
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,710
You need to be calmer. Take a deep breath, take a deep breath.

519
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:43,740
Okay!

520
00:54:58,790 --> 00:54:59,410
Here...

521
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,050
Come here!

522
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,320
He's licking it! He's licking it!

523
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,050
Your voice is too loud!

524
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,500
You're going to scare him away again!

525
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,080
Take a deep breath, take a deep breath.

526
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,290
Yes, just like that....

527
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,140
It's okay if you do it normally.

528
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:30,740
Normally huh? Normally...Normally...

529
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:51,790
Hey...

530
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:55,300
You can make a wonderful face like that too can't you?

531
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,790
This cat is pretty spoiled isn't he?

532
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:12,950
Both of you seem pretty spoiled to me.

533
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,870
Shut up...

534
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,250
Normally huh?

535
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:38,170
He's acting like himself.

536
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:42,530
He's eating a lot!

537
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,130
A lot! Amazing!

538
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,440
The other one came!

539
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:49,040
So cute!

540
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:58,770
I saw a little bit of their sweet side.

541
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,050
I think that's important.

542
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:03,210
Umm...

543
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,480
Thank you...

544
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:14,180
I was able to learn a lot of different things from you.

545
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:22,970
You..the cats...and everyone here are pros after all huh?

546
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:25,600
Yes!

547
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:29,650
Papa!

548
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,330
Hurry up! Hurry up!

549
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:33,030
Okay! Okay!

550
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,460
Here you go Dad!

551
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,710
Alright..

552
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,330
I'll show you what I'm made of.

553
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:01,370
So cute!

554
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:02,490
Look Papa!

555
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:07,430
The feelings that you aren't able to say very clearly...

556
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:11,910
Sometimes you can start to become more honest about them bit by bit.

557
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:17,090
It might seem easy but it is actually pretty difficult.

558
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:23,650
But the most important thing is the smiles of the people who are important to you after you do so.

559
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:30,060
I'm sure...it can be done!

560
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:48,520
The words "Looking back" may be used in a slightly negative sense.

561
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:55,650
But the people who can look back are actually strong people.

562
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:06,050
And then, are the people who are able to make a step forward stronger?

563
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,770
I think that they do become stronger.

564
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,640
The other side of farewell.

565
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,280
I'm sorry to everyone who was affected by this tragedy.

566
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:51,820
I'll see you again sensei!

567
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:15,600
Nothing is abnormal.

568
01:02:15,790 --> 01:02:17,350
Is that right?

569
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,730
Baron has been sick since yesterday.

570
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:22,450
Is he drinking water?

571
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:24,920
Yes. He's drinking a little too much.

572
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:26,290
Is that right?

573
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:28,480
Maybe it's stress?

574
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:30,120
Stress?

575
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:35,640
Has he been touched by a lot of different customers recently?

576
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,540
Not particularly...

577
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,810
And another thing...have you been stressed out?

578
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,090
Me?

579
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:53,760
Cats can feel when humans are stressed out and sometimes they get stressed out as well. So watch out for that.

580
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:55,350
Okay...

581
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,230
Is this theme good?

582
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:19,670
That looks nice.

583
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,440
Sakura-san.

584
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,180
Baron has had enough.

585
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:54,780
Sorry!

586
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,040
Are you okay?

587
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,170
Did something happen?

588
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:03,600
No, I'm totally okay!

589
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:47,430
Hana-chan?

590
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,300
Hana-chan?

591
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:01,380
You're late sensei.

592
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:08,600
It seems like Baron has calmed down already.

593
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,150
I see...

594
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,320
Thank goodness.

595
01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:22,110
Sensei...

596
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,590
Why didn't you realize this?

597
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:31,390
Sorry...

598
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:34,770
I'm really sorry...

599
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,480
I had to keep holding him down.

600
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:42,040
Hana-chan...

601
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:47,800
Sensei...

602
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,120
You're too late.

603
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:00,720
Hana-chan...

604
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:49,480
Sakura-san.

605
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:50,790
Are you okay?

606
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:53,640
Yeah..

607
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:54,780
I'm okay...

608
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,420
Your face is looking pale.

609
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:02,930
It's time to give them some snacks.

610
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:06,880
Sakura-san!

611
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,290
Sakura-san!

612
01:07:09,210 --> 01:07:10,480
Are you okay?

613
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:11,840
Sakura-san!

614
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,290
Sakura-san?

615
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:34,100
She bought a cat didn't she?

616
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,170
That's what it seems like.

617
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:47,290
A cat tower with no cat...feels pretty lonely.

618
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:32,900
She used to be my student.

619
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:38,200
I'm sorry!

620
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:42,320
It's okay!

621
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,960
You need to rest!

622
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:45,630
What about the store?

623
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:48,200
Yamamoto-kun is taking care of it.

624
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:04,020
Before I met you guys....I used to be a teacher.

625
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:06,890
Is that right?

626
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,470
I had a student called Hana-chan.

627
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:19,730
I found the cat that she was hiding behind the back of the school.

628
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:23,230
Sensei! How about we raise it together?

629
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:25,640
Well...but you know...

630
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:27,120
His name is Puchi!

631
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,510
It's a cute name isn't it?

632
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:30,790
You can't keep it at your house?

633
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:33,340
No way! My Dad can't stand cats.

634
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:36,460
In that case...

635
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:37,440
Where are you going to keep him?

636
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,080
Please sensei!

637
01:09:40,570 --> 01:09:41,420
Okay..

638
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,560
I understand.

639
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:00,040
Then...let's take care of him together.

640
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:01,980
Sensei!

641
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:04,680
But this has to be a secret okay?

642
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,280
Yeah! Thanks!

643
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,780
That's good for you Puchi!

644
01:10:20,980 --> 01:10:23,910
I did raise the kitty for some time but...

645
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:35,530
That girl died...

646
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,020
It was a suicide.

647
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:44,390
I was told that she was bullied.

648
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:53,760
I didn't notice it...

649
01:10:54,810 --> 01:10:55,960
Sakura-san...

650
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:59,670
After that I quit from the school right away.

651
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:04,000
And I raised Puchi here.

652
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:17,410
Sorry about this.

653
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:19,680
It's a pretty depressing story.

654
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,750
That kind of thing happened huh?

655
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,980
Sakura-san.

656
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:28,230
You're always talking about other people.

657
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,940
But you never really talk about yourself.

658
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,780
That's right.

659
01:11:36,190 --> 01:11:42,420
I'm not good at talking about myself...

660
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,060
Take a little break from the store.

661
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:45,320
About that...

662
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:47,490
You have a fever too.

663
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:50,200
Besides...you're going to this aren't you?

664
01:11:52,740 --> 01:11:53,640
No...

665
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:57,540
I didn't go to the ceremony.

666
01:11:58,610 --> 01:11:59,940
Even if I go now...

667
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:02,720
I don't know how to face her parents.

668
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,300
I think it would be better if you went.

669
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:16,790
Isn't the reason why Baron is stressed out because you have all of these worries?

670
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:23,870
Are you stressed out Sakura-san?

671
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:25,960
Me?

672
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:31,540
Cats can tell when a human is stressed out and they can become stressed too.

673
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:32,550
Be careful okay?

674
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:39,340
If that's the case...

675
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,620
Then for the sake of Baron and the other cats...

676
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:50,440
You need to go to Hana-chan's third year anniversary and sort out your feelings.

677
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:17,970
Sakura-san...

678
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,640
You need to rest some more!

679
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:25,610
It's okay.

680
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:27,780
My fever has already went down.

681
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:46,260
Sorry...this is my fault.

682
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,920
Alright! It's time for me to go back to my store.

683
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:58,380
Thanks.

684
01:13:58,540 --> 01:13:59,760
You're a lifesaver.

685
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,390
If anything happens then call me right away.

686
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:04,400
Please don't push yourself too much.

687
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:06,410
Later!

688
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:13,970
Baron...

689
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:19,080
Is that okay?

690
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:22,300
Today is special.

691
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,200
I need to spoil him sometimes.

692
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:30,260
Are you feeling better?

693
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:33,580
It's a snack for cats after all.

694
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,480
Good for you Baron!

695
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:42,420
He's eating a lot.

696
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,550
I'm glad you're doing better.

697
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:49,280
Eat up.

698
01:14:55,790 --> 01:14:57,700
Good for you Puchi!

699
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:05,870
I wonder if I can ever take care of him?

700
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:07,790
That's true.

701
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,440
After you graduate, won't you be living on your own?

702
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,000
That would be great!

703
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,890
I want to be with you forever!

704
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:20,560
Right?

705
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,240
Good for you Puchi!

706
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:38,260
Sakura-san?

707
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,390
Are you okay?

708
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:45,690
Sakura-san...

709
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:54,410
Hana-chan...really wanted to live.

710
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,260
Sakura-san...

711
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:00,530
I should have been more...

712
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:37,400
Yes?

713
01:16:41,110 --> 01:16:42,410
Nice to meet you.

714
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:44,970
My name is Sakuragi Sakura.

715
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:51,300
Come in!

716
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:33,470
The food should be ready in a little bit.

717
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:34,510
Okay!

718
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,000
Thanks for coming here.

719
01:17:43,530 --> 01:17:44,300
No problem.

720
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:49,500
Umm...

721
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:59,000
I need to apologize to you two.

722
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:00,320
Apologize?

723
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:02,080
Yes.

724
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:13,840
I was very close to Hana-san as her teacher.

725
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:19,100
That's why...

726
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,760
If I would have noticed this...

727
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:24,660
Then I could have done something and...

728
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:29,570
Everyone is saying the same thing.

729
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:35,550
Her teachers, her childhood friends and her other friends.

730
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,260
Everyone...

731
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:40,100
But you know what?

732
01:18:42,130 --> 01:18:47,990
When we hear those words...It's super painful because we are the ones who think that the most.

733
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:51,000
We are her parents.

734
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:59,460
Why didn't we the family notice this?

735
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:03,290
When other people use those words...

736
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:07,570
We feel like we are being blamed...

737
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:09,030
That wasn't my intention!

738
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:10,210
I'm sorry!

739
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:11,490
It's fine! It's fine!

740
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:15,250
We didn't want to talk about that today.

741
01:19:19,070 --> 01:19:19,970
You know what?

742
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:26,090
The other day...we finally organized Hana's room.

743
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:29,990
When we did, we found her diary.

744
01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:38,850
To be honest...we were afraid to see it.

745
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:12,630
Today me and Sakura sensei feed Puchi some homemade fish snacks.

746
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:28,010
Puchi finished my meal. I'm only 18. I feel like it will be a little bit longer.

747
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,480
Lately Puchi hasn't had an appetite.

748
01:20:39,230 --> 01:20:43,820
Sakura sensei has been researching a way on how to make pet food.

749
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:45,660
She's a god!

750
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:56,760
I took a lot of time in sewing toys for Puchi but it was a big failure!

751
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:01,090
Sakura sensei was laughing so hard she cried!

752
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,820
I'll get my revenge next time!

753
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:15,910
I'm really grateful that Sakura sensei was able to meet Puchi!

754
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:20,320
I'll look forward to seeing them tomorrow!

755
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:35,500
She didn't write anything about her getting bullied.

756
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:44,050
She wrote a ton of things about the fun times she had with you and us...

757
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:52,460
Thanks for being with Hana until the very end!

758
01:22:01,390 --> 01:22:10,770
I was also so happy being together with Hana-san!

759
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:06,730
Puri! Puri!

760
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:10,650
Puri!

761
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:14,280
Welcome!

762
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:30,350
Are you by yourself?

763
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:34,900
Yes...

764
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:41,800
Sorry to keep you waiting!

765
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:13,690
There are some things in the past that I can't change and that I worry about.

766
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,370
But...even then...

767
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:20,850
I still want to do my best here!

768
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:27,610
There are people who are important to me and that cherish me.

769
01:24:28,490 --> 01:24:35,780
And there are cats here who give me something irreplaceable.

770
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:38,120
In this place.

771
01:24:56,720 --> 01:28:56,000
