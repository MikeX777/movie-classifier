1
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,760
Hey, bestie!

2
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,000
- He asleep?
- Yeah, he crashed.

3
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,920
I closed his door.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,359
That means we can play music!
Look what I pilfered!

5
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:15,599
You're amazing!

6
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,560
But it'll wake him up!

7
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,439
It's not The Gypsy Kings!
This is mellow.

8
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,040
Now it's almost empty.

9
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,319
Add some water.
They'll never know.

10
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,560
No talking!
The beginning's the most beautiful part.

11
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,040
I wish we could go to Amorgos.

12
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,000
- We'll go!
- I promise.

13
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,719
But we're not free diving!

14
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,799
- You've never tried!
- I know myself.

15
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,719
Plus, I have tried!

16
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,359
I swear! In the bathtub.

17
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,719
Know how long I lasted?

18
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,040
Can't we just enjoy the music?

19
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:30,319
TWO TICKETS TO GREECE

20
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,479
Everything okay, Blandine?
We're not intruding?

21
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:03,840
Where's Gaspard?

22
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,319
In his room.

23
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,319
And who's she?

24
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,280
- My best friend.
- I'm Magalie.

25
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,199
Are you kidding me?
Gather up your little things and take off.

26
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,560
Get out!

27
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,520
- You said you were going to a movie.
- We changed our mind!

28
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,039
Now we have to apologize
to the babysitter! What's she doing?

29
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,919
Taking myBig Blue CD.

30
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,159
Now tap into your mischievous side
and let out whatever comes up.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,039
Let's take a deep breath,

32
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,280
lift our arms to the sky...

33
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,599
Very good... And let go!

34
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,560
What's going on, Blandine?
What's wrong?

35
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,319
Sorry, I don't think I can.

36
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,519
It's your first class.
Don't throw in the towel so fast!

37
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,040
Sorry, I know myself.

38
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,839
I can't. And I feel like
I'm surrounded by retards.

39
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,600
Let's keep those remarks to ourselves.

40
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,920
There are no retards here. Just people
like you, here to release their stress.

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,879
To stimulate joy in their life!

42
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,360
Too bad for her! She can go.
We'll keep laughing.

43
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:41,079
We're all together,
and we'll have fun!

44
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,040
I hope you just paid
for the first class?

45
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,160
She made me pay
for the whole quarter.

46
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,680
Okay. Tell me what it cost
and I'll pay you back.

47
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:58,439
And stop worrying about me, Benji.

48
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,120
- That's not what I need me get better.
- Right!

49
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,160
- What?
- Nothing.

50
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,680
Come on, what is it?

51
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,160
If I don't push you
to do stuff like that...

52
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,079
you do nothing.

53
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,839
- You stagnate.
- I stagnate?

54
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,199
- I did go back to work!
- What a feat!

55
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
Honey...

56
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,319
That is progress!

57
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,839
I think I'm getting back on my feet.

58
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:34,519
Six months ago, you couldn't
get me down the stairs. But now...

59
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,800
- Isn't that true?
- It's true.

60
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,720
So stop fretting about me.
I'm fine.

61
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,160
- How was the chicken?
- Okay. But the rice tastes weird.

62
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,079
Really?

63
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,000
We'll see how you feed yourself now.

64
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,360
I never could live with roommates.

65
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,959
Even at your age.

66
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,040
Yeah, so?

67
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,839
I say that because
you think I'm alone.

68
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,800
I think it's a question of temperament.

69
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,639
Some people...

70
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,759
- What's this envelope?
- Oh, right!

71
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,040
Dad's wedding invitation.

72
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,759
Tell me it's for you!

73
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,839
He's not forcing me
to go to his wedding?

74
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,240
I got one, and so did you.

75
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,879
What? He's polite.
Whether you go is up to you.

76
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,920
What nerve!
The guy's shameless.

77
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,079
If you weren't invited,
you'd make a fuss, too.

78
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,519
There...

79
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,360
you're way off the mark. Because...

80
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,720
what upsets me
is that it's a provocation.

81
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,399
He knows I'd never set foot
in his shitty little hick-town wedding.

82
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,399
- It's on Lake Annecy.
- Annecy's no paradise.

83
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,839
- Okay?
- Salomé was born there.

84
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,120
Salomé... Salami!

85
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,040
- Look at these hideous doves!
- Would you prefer crows?

86
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,120
And those tacky intertwining letters.

87
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,920
Mom, you're not getting back
on your feet.

88
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,759
- Take the rack. It's practical.
- The what?

89
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,240
The laundry rack.
It'll come in handy.

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,439
That thing's gross!

91
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,439
It's not made to be pretty.

92
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,920
What's in here?
CDs! These are yours.

93
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,519
Sure your new place has heat?
It's cold now.

94
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,279
Mom, I checked. It works. Okay?

95
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,920
Womack and Womack...

96
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,839
Bangles...
Never heard of these guys.

97
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,720
Who's Magalie Graulières?

98
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:46,199
"This CD belongs to Magalie Graulières."

99
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,879
Let me see!

100
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,360
Mom...

101
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,279
She was my friend in middle school.

102
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,480
Pint-sized, but a big mouth!

103
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,319
As sassy as they come!

104
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,680
The funniest girl on earth!

105
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:12,199
Why'd you lose touch?

106
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,720
We had a fight over something stupid.

107
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,879
At that age
you swing from love to hate.

108
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,639
Then she moved away and we lost touch.

109
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,879
- You'll keep in touch, won't you?
- Sure.

110
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,279
Benji...

111
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,320
- Excited?
- Big time!

112
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,480
If the landlord drops in
and sees this mess, you guys are out!

113
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:58,639
- What did you cook that's so caked on?
- Pasta.

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,159
Forget the sponge,
we need a scraper.

115
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,559
Stop!
Give me my cell phone!

116
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,600
- I don't guess you have one?
- What?

117
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,519
A scraper.
Or a thermal stripper.

118
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,879
Mom, who cares?
We have to go, I reserved.

119
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,840
- Don't be mad. I think I'll go home.
- What?

120
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,840
On Saturday, it'll be packed.

121
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,919
And with the road work,
there'll be a detour.

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,799
No way are you dumping me!

123
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,720
- And I don't feel well.
- I know you. No more hunger strikes!

124
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,519
Drop the sponge, we're going!

125
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,919
Come on!

126
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,240
Mom!

127
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,159
I can't wear these gloves.

128
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,440
We're going for Indian food?

129
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Yeah.

130
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,039
We eat that stuff every day at work!

131
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,840
- Will you stop.
- What?

132
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,720
Can't you be little more fun?

133
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,240
I'm loads of fun!
Can't we just pick another restaurant?

134
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,679
No, it's happening here.

135
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,639
- What's happening?
- I'm leaving, you have a date.

136
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,480
What date?

137
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,279
You're dining with Magalie Graulières.

138
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,559
I tracked her down on Facebook.
She's inside. So don't keep her waiting.

139
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,960
Benjamin...

140
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,200
No way! You can't...

141
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,600
- I'm not going!
- Yes, you are.

142
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:24,279
- What'll I say?
- Talk about old times.

143
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,879
You'll laugh.
I'm sure you'll thank me for it.

144
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,559
Good evening.

145
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,519
- Are you Blandine?
- Yes.

146
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,279
Your friend's already here.

147
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,559
- May I take your coat?
- Yes.

148
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:40,960
- Thank you.
- Will you follow me?

149
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:41,960
Yes.

150
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:51,840
Magalie?

151
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,320
- Your earring's gouging me.
- Sorry!

152
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:07,080
Oh, yeah!

153
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
It's so great to see you!

154
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,960
You haven't changed.

155
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,840
Back in school,
those kids would call me "ma'am".

156
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,080
No, why?

157
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,960
Okay, your cheeks are gaunt,
you have bags under your eyes.

158
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:24,240
Who cares?
It'll happen to us all!

159
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,840
But I see my old friend Blandine!

160
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,159
That's sweet.

161
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,600
I hear you're blue
and you've lost your lust for life!

162
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,960
That's what he said?

163
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,879
Let's just say
his dad and I split up...

164
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,519
Well, he's the one who...

165
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,279
- I mean...
- Don't sweat it!

166
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,399
Separations are never easy.

167
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,679
So there've been some ups and downs.

168
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,440
He did emphasize the downs.

169
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,759
I don't know why
he's so intent on shaking me up.

170
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,720
But it's given us a chance to reunite!

171
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,200
That's true.

172
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,519
Benjamin...

173
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,159
I thought his telephone voice was...

174
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,679
pretty hot!

175
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,679
Then I saw his pictures on Facebook...
Cute guy!

176
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,159
He's my type!

177
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,600
What are you drinking?

178
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,960
The house cocktail.

179
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,720
It's not bad.
But it needs a bit more booze.

180
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:23,519
This almost tastes like water.

181
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,759
- Want one?
- No.

182
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,080
I'm already a little queasy.
Plus, I have to drive home.

183
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:33,559
- Now I live...
- In the 'burbs, I know.

184
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,320
Okay.

185
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,679
You live in Paris?

186
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
In Montmartre.

187
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,080
- How great!
- Just a tiny attic studio.

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,279
A 7th floor walk-up.

189
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,759
But it keeps me in shape.
So my gams...

190
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,759
are great!

191
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,000
Not to mention my glutes!
Tight as drums!

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,200
I had a dentist there.

193
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,879
- I don't know why I said that.
- No, that interests me.

194
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,240
What do you do for a living?
I guess my son told you about me.

195
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,639
No.

196
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,320
I'm an electro-radiology technician.

197
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,039
So, super serious!

198
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,039
So you totally gave up blading?

199
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:21,720
Blading?

200
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,200
Rollerblading. You were a fiend!

201
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,639
It was fascinating!

202
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,759
No kidding! You could've gone pro!
I don't know...

203
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,039
been a teacher or an artist.

204
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,360
There are figure skaters,
choreographers.

205
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:37,960
I imagine.

206
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:42,000
I opted for something more traditional,
with regular hours.

207
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,840
And what do you do?

208
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:48,799
Me?
Let's say I'm a music journalist.

209
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,919
- So you write for a newspaper.
- Yes.

210
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,200
Well, not at the moment. But yes.

211
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,679
I've written articles,
reviews for various magazines.

212
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,440
But it was getting monotonous,
so I'm taking a break.

213
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,360
My problem is I'm really into old stuff.

214
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,879
For example, at the moment,
I'm into disco.

215
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,440
Drag balls, New York... Very New York!

216
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,720
And now all they want me to write about
are chicks with Auto-Tune voices.

217
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,480
Or pseudo-singers
in those rigged TV talent contests.

218
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:26,360
Mainstream's really gonna kill us!
I couldn't take it anymore!

219
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:29,200
So a little restful detox!

220
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,039
So what's good to eat?

221
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,600
When Benjamin asked me to find
something in the 'hood, I chose Indian.

222
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,559
- Good choice.
- Because I'm vegetarian.

223
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,720
Very good choice.

224
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,840
Chicken tikka masala!
Always a safe choice.

225
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:48,559
And for me...
Yeah!

226
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,360
Sorry, it's my roomie.

227
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Didn't you say your place was teeny?

228
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,120
Yes.

229
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:06,799
He's a pal of my girlfriend's.
He came here for a job

230
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,799
and needed a crash pad.

231
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,039
- Did she know your place was small?
- Yeah!

232
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,000
She mostly knew I needed dough.
And the guy agreed.

233
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,080
We couldn't have separate rooms,
since it's a studio.

234
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,039
So he slept in a comforter on the floor.
Which broke my heart.

235
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,519
So we slept head-to-foot in my bed.
One thing led to another...

236
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,120
- That's sweet.
- Yeah!

237
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,360
But... he has a boyfriend.

238
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,240
A boyfriend?

239
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,879
In Bayonne, he has a guy.
And in Paris, me.

240
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,919
So you have some of my CDs.

241
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,559
JustThe Big Blue.

242
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,919
That film!

243
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,799
We were such fans!

244
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,799
- Yeah!
- The Jean-Marc Barr posters!

245
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,480
The dialogue we memorized!

246
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:03,960
We were young.

247
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,039
We were hicks!

248
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,039
That song with the dolphins singing!

249
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,159
That's strictly
for the Discovery Channel!

250
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,279
Remember how we wanted
to run away to Amorgos!

251
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,840
- Amorgos?
- The island inThe Big Blue !

252
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,080
We had it all planned!

253
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,559
The boat from Marseille to Athens...

254
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:22,799
Why didn't we go?

255
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,519
We were minors.

256
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,799
And we got into a huge fight.

257
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,519
Remember Nicolas Fiévet!

258
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,240
- Let's not rehash all that!
- No, there's a statute of limitations.

259
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,519
But at the time, it destroyed me.

260
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,759
Maybe because it was my first crush.

261
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,840
And I wrote such a gushing letter.

262
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,159
You even offered to give it to him.

263
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,639
You probably thought I was terrified.

264
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,200
So when I found it folded up
and stuck in your notebook,

265
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,240
it was...

266
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Not cool.

267
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,400
No, not cool.

268
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,799
So what happened? Your folks got
divorced and you left with your mom?

269
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,640
Yeah, exactly.
Like lots of kids.

270
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,599
So did you ever go to Greece?

271
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,400
I'm going this summer!

272
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,519
- With Benjamin.
- Great!

273
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:27,880
He moved out, so we decided
to go on vacation together.

274
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,440
We fly to Santorini,
then take a ferry to Amorgos.

275
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,279
I'll finally see that monastery on the...

276
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:40,559
You're not taking your son
to a monastery?

277
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,599
If you're going to the Cyclades,
go to Ios or Mykonos!

278
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,440
They have amazing parties
on the beach, in villas!

279
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,759
When I went, I booked a room.

280
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,880
After two days, I gave it up.
I was never there!

281
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,960
Your biryani dripped.

282
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Shit!

283
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:00,240
Eating Indian-style is an art.

284
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,519
What a drag,
I have to return this top.

285
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,319
- It's machine washable.
- No way! Look!

286
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,440
Now I buy things to wear one night.
Less waste, more eco-friendly!

287
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,799
Be right back!

288
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,000
My cock's getting impatient!

289
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,359
- Get it out?
- Not really.

290
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,400
I'll see if they have anything...

291
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,279
Is that my phone?
Read me the text!

292
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:52,160
I don't know how it works.

293
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,640
It's not hard!
Don't you have an iPhone?

294
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,720
What a jerk!
Look, it's my roomie.

295
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,839
Cute, huh?

296
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,640
And that impatience
is out of this world!

297
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,240
We're talking top drawer!

298
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,279
I'll tell you about it.

299
00:19:10,359 --> 00:19:11,519
Sanjit, honey!

300
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,359
Got any stain remover?

301
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,039
...3202.

302
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,160
And?
It's two numbers short.

303
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,200
Right, the 89.
...893202.

304
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,599
Okay.

305
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,480
Great!
It's in my address book!

306
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,519
We'll do it again
and you can introduce me to Benjamin!

307
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,519
Okay.

308
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,039
There's a party over there!

309
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:39,240
Look! Let's crash it.

310
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,039
They're in costume.
We won't get in.

311
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,160
Oh, yeah...

312
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,480
- See you soon!
- That's a promise.

313
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,680
Not in 30 years!
Or we really won't recognize each other.

314
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:51,920
- Get home safe!
- You, too. Ciao!

315
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,920
Wait!

316
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,839
Excuse me!

317
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,640
Hello.

318
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,240
- I don't have the code.
- Good timing!

319
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,599
- I'm Mitch!
- Nice to meet you! Magalie.

320
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,960
So? How was the reunion?

321
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,599
An evening with the biggest freeloader
on earth...

322
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,400
Great!
I'm thrilled!

323
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,799
Thank you!

324
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,119
- I'm about to have breakfast.
-Then what?

325
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Then I'm.... supposed to see Magalie.

326
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,039
Great! What'll you do?

327
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,079
- A flea market.
- A flea market?

328
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,599
She likes them, too.

329
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:22,240
What an awful chignon!

330
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,519
He's a good actor but always the same.

331
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,880
- Have a nice evening.
- Thank you.

332
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,880
Goodbye.

333
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,880
Look what I bought today.

334
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,559
Homer
The Odyssey

335
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,680
The perfect occasion to reread it.

336
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,599
Shall we have a drink?

337
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:41,000
Thank you.

338
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,440
- Why didn't you tell me sooner?
- I was afraid of your reaction.

339
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:47,960
And I wanted to find a solution.

340
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,000
- A solution?
- I can't go, but you're not going alone!

341
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,279
Now you're scaring me.

342
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:58,039
I asked Magalie and...
she said yes!

343
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,160
No way am I going to Greece
with that nutjob!

344
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,480
What about the nutjob
who claimed you were best buddies,

345
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,359
when you never called her back!

346
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,480
You kept hounding me!

347
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,759
I did it so you'd leave me in peace.

348
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,880
Wow! The chick's all alone
and wants to be left in peace.

349
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,039
That "chick" is your mother!

350
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,480
I'm sorry, but...

351
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
If I never saw her again,

352
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,480
why would she agree
to go on this trip with me just like that?

353
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:28,519
Is that normal?

354
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,960
You know what, Mom?

355
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,839
I don't give a shit.

356
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:38,279
Now you have two weeks
to kill each other or patch things up.

357
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,519
But I really don't care which.

358
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:56,559
Little Blandine Bouvier,
please come to the information desk.

359
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,119
Your mommy's waiting for you.

360
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,920
Magalie?

361
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,160
Blandine!

362
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,240
- That's your little girl?
- Yeah!

363
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:19,640
Is this a joke?

364
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,359
- Think I've got nothing else to do?
- Lighten up!

365
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,359
I do that in the supermarket
all the time.

366
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,680
It cracks me up!

367
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:33,039
So, no comment?
What do you think?

368
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,039
Debbie Harry! Blondie!

369
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,000
You really need to check in.
They're about to close.

370
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,240
Just so there's no problem...
Did your son fill you in?

371
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,319
I'm really broke at the moment.

372
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,960
But I'll obviously pay you back.
That's imminent!

373
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,920
- Don't worry.
- A down vest? For Greece?

374
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,799
There's AC everywhere now...

375
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,319
And it is sleeveless!
Come on!

376
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,960
Best Hospitals and Clinics 2019

378
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,200
Duty-free items!

379

Duty-free!

380
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,359
Come here.

381
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,160
What are you doing?

382
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,759
I'm collecting souvenirs.

383
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,799
To make a travel journal.

384
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:48,440
And you wanna put the barf bag
on page one?

385
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,759
It says "Greece" on it.

386
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,559
Mind your own business, please.

387
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,160
You haven't changed!

388
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,960
I remember,
you used to keep a diary.

389
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,839
I kept one until 2017.

390
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,680
I must have about forty of them.

391
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,720
So why'd you stop?

392
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,960
I'm sorry.

393
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,359
He really screwed you up.

394
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,319
You'll see! After this trip,

395
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,720
you won't even remember his name.

396
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,559
Or you could end up like her.

397
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,039
A widow crying over her husband,
sacrificing herself.

398
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,559
And the worst... I don't think
she's ever been with anyone else.

399
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,160
What?
Are you kidding? You, too?

400
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,480
Stop! Stop!
They'll think a reactor's on fire!

401
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,480
Shush!

402
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,440
Hold on, I'm trying
to wrap my mind around this.

403
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,000
This is impossible.

404
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:08,119
My friends say I could be a life coach.
I find that absurd.

405
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,079
But now I have no choice!

406
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:21,839
There! "Blandine Bouvier"!

407
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,200
Ms. Bouvier?

408
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,799
Look! I'm not lying!

409
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,160
"Reservation to Ferry Terminal
in a Mercedes van."

410
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,799
Who cares? We're in Greece!

411
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,279
Demis Roussos!

412
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,839
Be careful, Magalie!

413
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:54,640
It's sublime!

414
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,160
SANTORINI

415
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,720
How about a little brewski?

416
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:02,000
I never touch alcohol
before getting on a boat.

417
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,119
Well, I do.

418
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,960
Excuse me,
can I have a beer, please?

419
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,519
In a pinch,
I can use your barf bag!

420
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,279
So...

421
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,200
Are we gonna mention
what a big fibber you are?

422
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,279
We're not gonna
pretend nothing happened.

423
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,440
Why'd you tell Benji we were "besties",
when you never called me?

424
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,240
And I left you umpteen messages.

425
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Nine. I counted.

426
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,960
To get him off your back?

427
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,960
And why'd you avoid me?

428
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:42,559
'Cause I'm a little over-the-top?

429
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,440
I know that.

430
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,640
Lots of my friends say I'm loud.

431
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,480
One even calls me "Tinnitus".

432
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,359
Let's say, you're a bit much,
and I can't do much of anything.

433
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,920
It'll come back to you.

434
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:58,160
But I want you to tell me
when I'm too much. Okay?

435
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,640
That means
"Thanks very much" in Greek.

436
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,519
How'd you react
when my son suggested this trip?

437
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,960
It made me laugh.
But I didn't say a word.

438
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,160
Then I thought
I was being given another chance.

439
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,160
We were given another chance.

440
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,720
That's what I thought, too.

441
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:25,160
To Hélène Boucher Middle School!

442
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,480
- Isn't that our boat, there?
- Could be.

443
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,880
What time is it?

444
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,119
- I'll see if the ticket office is open.
- I'll go!

445
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,039
- I'll give you some cash.
- I can pay for that!

446
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,000
Please, please, can I help you?
Yes... Heavy, it's heavy.

447
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:21,720
Ok. Madame, where are you going?
Here? Yes, yes... We go together.

448
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:37,400
- What did he say?
- No idea.

449
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,480
- What are our seat numbers?
- 374 and 375.

450
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,839
Can I have the tickets
for my journal?

451
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:49,000
I think we're further down...

452
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,440
Can I have the tickets?

453
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,880
Yes.

454
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,640
Where does it say "Amorgos"?

455
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,039
These aren't tickets to Amorgos!

456
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:03,359
Sure they are! Stop stressing.

457
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,039
I'm stressed
because it doesn't say "Amorgos"!

458
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,880
- What's this destination?
- Let me explain.

459
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,839
They just check the tickets
when you get on the boat.

460
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,359
- Then they never look at them again.
- So?

461
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,880
So it's no use paying
for where you're actually going.

462
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:20,000
So what did you pay for?

463
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,160
For the first stop.
We'll just get off later.

464
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,039
So it's a scam?

465
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
A tiny one.

466
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:32,480
That's exactly why
I didn't call you back.

467
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,400
I'm too old for these schemes
and living dangerously!

468
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,240
Blandine, stop now!
Everyone does it.

469
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:41,640
It's even recommended
in the Routard guide.

470
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,039
Right! I have the Routard!

471
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,319
What did he say?

472
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,960
I don't know. I don't speak Greek.

473
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,720
- You must go now.
- No, no... We continue.

474
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,200
Tickets please!

475
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,720
Yes... Give! Give! Give!

476
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,359
What a memory!

477
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:09,400
With all the people on this boat!
Impressive!

478
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,640
- No. You have to go.
- No, no, let me explain.

479
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,359
- It's a mistake. We go to Amorgos.
- No, look, Kérinos. Kérinos here.

480
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,160
Yes, yes, but... We want Amorgos.

481
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:25,880
Sorry! My English terrible. You know...

482
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,039
I say to the lady of thickets Amorgos,

483
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,400
and, I don't know,
she undestands... Kerinos. Sorry!

484
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:37,359
Innocent!

485
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,160
Where's the ferry schedule?

486
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,160
It must be that.

487
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,400
How cute!

488
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:52,960
It's illegible.

489
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,759
- Let's see.
- It's illegible!

490
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,440
Yes, but...

491
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,960
It's high season.
Ferries come and go all the time.

492
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,240
Chill out!

493
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,880
Hold this!

494
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:10,839
Kerinos...

495
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,119
It's so beautiful.

496
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,400
Page 401...

497
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:24,640
"At 15.2 sq. km., Kerinos is
the largest of the Lesser Cyclades.

498
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,640
"Today a semi-desertic island,

499
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,480
"it played a major role
in Cycladic civilization.

500
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:34,119
"Famous figurines, now exhibited
in Athens, were found here."

501
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Awesome!

502
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:37,559
What else?

503
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:39,680
That's it!

504
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:43,119
Any addresses?
Where to eat or get ice cream?

505
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,359
Okay.

506
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,559
What'll save us is the "semi".

507
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,359
If it's semi-desertic,
there must be one place that's lively.

508
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:00,519
Yes. But if we go on the theory that
the port is always the liveliest spot,

509
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:03,400
then this must be
the epicenter of activity!

510
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,880
I'll call a friend.
Well, her boyfriend.

511
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,599
He's Greek. He knows these islands
like the back of his hand.

512
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,160
He can fill us in!

513
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,240
Hold on...

514
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,799
I can't see a thing in this sun.

515
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:26,440
Do you have a signal?

516
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,559
KERINOS

517
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,720
Blandine!

518
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:32,160
I don't feel like talking.

519
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:36,359
- Wait, Blandine!
- Leave me alone, please.

520
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,519
Take it easy! Nobody died!
Look, the weather's gorgeous!

521
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:46,480
- We're on a beautifully paved road.
- But where does it go?

522
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,359
Where does this road go?

523
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,440
We don't know where we're going!

524
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,359
We may wind up back at the sea
and have to walk back!

525
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,599
We'll have tried!

526
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,680
And we'll sleep under the stars!

527
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:06,839
What? What do you think we'd have
done, if we ran away at 15?

528
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,199
We'd have been wild and free!
Hippies on the run!

529
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,719
Sleeping in the open air!

530
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,760
You see?

531
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:18,039
We'll pay tribute
to the kids we once were!

532
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,880
Devoured by mosquitoes and snakes?
Some tribute!

533
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,159
In any case, I get it.

534
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,960
For you, nothing's a problem.
Everything's great.

535
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Right now...

536
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,039
I should be in the swankiest hotel
in Amorgos, sipping a cocktail.

537
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:40,960
Lounging in my suite.
Or in a bathrobe in the spa!

538
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:41,960
Yeah.

539
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:49,039
I understand. Blandine, you know,
hotels know that people miss their boats.

540
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,639
Tomorrow, we'll get there,
explain that to them, and it'll be fine.

541
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,719
And if I may...

542
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,079
Luxury hotels here
are a load of shit.

543
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,639
The spas, facial scrubs,
hydro-whatever jets...

544
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,719
Remember you said,
"Tell me when I'm too much"?

545
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,119
I'm telling you.

546
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,760
Okay.

547
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,960
No problem.
Got the message.

548
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,679
Sorry, we don't understand.

549
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:29,679
Didn't you take German
as your first language?

550
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,639
You're demented!
I never took German.

551
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:33,800
As first or second language.

552
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,079
Remember?
We had Ms. Brouillet for English.

553
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:41,119
The crackpot who made us sing
the songWords by F.R. David.

554
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,079
Oh, right. I remember.

555
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,280
Everything okay?
Get some pretty pictures?

556
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,719
I offered to help.
You said, "Hands off!"

557
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:03,519
Because
you tried to take off the wrong tire!

558
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,519
Exactly!

559
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:14,360
She still can't understand
that I don't understand.

560
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,760
Please! Magalie, no!

561
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,119
The geriatric shift!

562
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,639
Good evening!

563
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:37,400
- Are you French?
- Yes.

564
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,159
Birgit said you were lost.

565
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,840
Yes. We weren't supposed
to stop here, but...

566
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,960
- You're in luck! I have one room left.
- Great!

567
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:48,840
Want something to eat?
The kitchen's about to close.

568
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,239
Gladly!

569
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,519
Excuse me...

570
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,760
Who are these people?

571
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,360
An archeological group.

572
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,039
They're from Dusseldorf, Cologne...
They stay for months.

573
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,360
- Great!
- It's very small here.

574
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:07,800
The only tourists we get
are archeologists or surfers.

575
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:10,159
- Okay!
- Take a seat!

576
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,239
Thank you so much!

577
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,840
Just our luck!
We got the archeologists!

578
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:22,960
Although, Indiana Jones...

579
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:28,760
But these guys look even older
than the rocks they dig up.

580
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,280
And that music!

581
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:34,800
It's gut-wrenching.

582
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,400
They'd be better off playing nothing!

583
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,760
I warn you...

584
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,960
tomorrow we're up at dawn
to catch the first ferry.

585
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,280
What's the matter?

586
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:50,559
I just can't stand that music.

587
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,559
I'll never make it through dinner
listening to that.

588
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,280
Impossible!

589
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,239
- Come on!
- We have to eat now!

590
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,559
Who cares?!

591
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,079
No boat till Thursday?

592
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:43,920
It doesn't stop here every day.
It's very small, you know.

593
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:47,119
I'm not staying
till the day after tomorrow!

594
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,039
- What about the fancy hotel I paid for?
- Wait, wait...

595
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,920
Excuse me,
we don't have to take the ferry.

596
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,119
Maybe some fisherman
could take us in their boats to...

597
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:01,360
No, here...

598
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,119
there are very few fishermen.
You know...

599
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:06,039
It's very small. We got that!

600
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,280
Calm down, Blandine.
It's not her fault.

601
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:12,000
Nobody asked you!
Your bullshit got us into this mess!

602
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:16,639
I'm really not into these vibes.

603
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,440
Go back to the dance floor!

604
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,199
Excuse me, does the room have AC?

605
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,760
Success! I found it!

606
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:40,000
You did?

607
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,639
I know what we can do
till the boat comes.

608
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,840
We'll go see the surfers!

609
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,159
- Would you rather dig with the Krauts?
- I'd rather not be here!

610
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:55,920
Elena explained everything.
There's a famous spot where they camp.

611
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,840
Surfers come from the world over.
Isn't that tempting?

612
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,519
A hunky Australian surfer
for Blandine?

613
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,719
- Please taste this baklava! It's lethal!
- No.

614
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,440
What do you think?

615
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,400
Isn't that a great idea?

616
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:14,239
Elena's even lending us her truck.
And making sandwiches!

617
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,000
It'll be so much fun!
We'll be queens!

618
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,000
Why not just go to the beach downstairs?

619
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,920
And do what?
Make sand castles?

620
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,920
- Plus, it's dangerous.
- Really? May I know why?

621
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,440
Yes. Elena explained it to me.
A very rare marine phenomenon.

622
00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:35,000
A vortex or something.

623
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:38,760
You can be swept out to sea
by tidal waves.

624
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,079
Like in Hossegor. Or Reunion.
I almost drowned there once!

625
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,760
And I'm the fibber?

626
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:49,880
Before we left, I reread my journal.
Not all of it!

627
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,840
Just the parts about us.
I don't know if you recall,

628
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,360
but you convinced me
that your father invented Wite-Out.

629
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:00,079
Yeah...

630
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,239
So...

631
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:05,039
are we on for tomorrow?

632
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:10,760
Holy cow!

633
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,880
It's magnificent!

634
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,199
We're lucky to have
this stopover in Kerinos. Look!

635
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:22,440
I came forThe Big Blue,
and I find myself in Point Break !

636
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,480
That's the problem with surfers!

637
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:31,840
They prefer big waves
to two pretty patooties, like us!

638
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:35,840
Think I'm still pretty?

639
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,880
No...

640
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:41,360
Come on! Obviously!

641
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,159
Look at that face!
Why do you doubt yourself?

642
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,920
When you have a son who's 20
and his father dumps you

643
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,320
for a women
who's about the kid's age...

644
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,440
you wonder
if you're past your expiration date.

645
00:42:56,519 --> 00:42:59,000
"Past your expiration date"?
That's taboo!

646
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,119
- Yeah, but...
- No!

647
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:04,280
You're stunning!
Look what a great body you have!

648
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,639
It's true!

649
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:08,360
This is the start of a new era.

650
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:12,280
Your erotic potential will blossom.

651
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,280
I can feel it.

652
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,840
I can!

653
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,840
- Are you kidding me? 100 SPF?
- Yeah.

654
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,559
I didn't know that existed.

655
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,679
Get a load of this guy!

656
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,800
American, for sure!

657
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:28,639
Florida or... California!

658
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,840
- That's 100% Californian!
- You speak French!

659
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:36,039
Yes. Wild!

660
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:37,840
Cool! French girls!

661
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:39,440
I'm from Brussels.

662
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:42,239
- Brussels, California.
- Okay, okay.

663
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,280
We're from Paris.
Well, she's in Meudon.

664
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,760
So you're on vacation
here in Kerinos?

665
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,960
- A forget-it-all vacation. And you?
- I'm here with two buddies.

666
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,360
We came to check out this spot,
which isn't bad.

667
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:56,840
Not bad at all.

668
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,719
- Can I join you?
- Of course.

669
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,360
- We're Blandine and Magalie.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Maxime.

670
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,679
I'm taking it easy.
I hit a rock yesterday.

671
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,400
That must've really hurt.

672
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,800
No big deal. I disinfected it.

673
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,039
I won't bore you with my little booboos.

674
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:22,719
You're not boring us at all.
On the contrary!

675
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,400
Doesn't your friend speak?

676
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:27,679
Yes...

677
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,320
Tell him about your passion.
Blandine's like you, she's into sports.

678
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:36,880
- Rollerblading!
- Wow! You're a skater?

679
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,719
No, when I was a teenager!
A long time ago.

680
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:42,719
It wasn't that long ago!

681
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:45,760
So, a Belgian surfer?

682
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,079
Do you have...

683
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,840
big waves back home?

684
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,840
No, that's why we come here.

685
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,719
But it's so deserted here.

686
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,960
Aside from catching waves,
what else is there to do?

687
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:03,199
Cruise chicks.

688
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,960
- There are just goats.
- Oh, no!

689
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:07,760
Steamy!

690
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,639
Maxime,
is it true what they say about surfers?

691
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,280
That you're incredible in bed. You're
so patient, waiting for those waves.

692
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:22,239
So you take your time.
You're not instant jackhammers.

693
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,880
Is that true or not?

694
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,800
Indeed.

695
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:32,199
There've been
several scientific studies.

696
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,400
It's funny you mention it.
Because I was a guinea pig!

697
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,440
Maxime!

698
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,079
Be right there!

699
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,039
Maybe we can elaborate
on that next time.

700
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,320
Sure!

701
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:47,719
See you soon!

702
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,480
You're completely...

703
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:59,199
You were a huge,
huge hit with him!

704
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,000
Stop! You'll get my phone wet!

705
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,960
- I have a big problem.
- What now?

706
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,639
My bank wired 602 euros
to the electric company. It's weird!

707
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:22,400
So, a forget-nothing vacation.

708
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:26,599
Could your neighbors
be tapping into your meter?

709
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,800
I do that sometimes,
when I'm broke.

710
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,719
I hook into my neighbor's meter.

711
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,840
That's not really
Mr. and Mrs. Duchesnay's style.

712
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,480
So... Wanna know
what his buddies are like?

713
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:41,840
How are they?

714
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,159
I think we'll really have fun.

715
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,039
So what shall we do?

716
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,800
Join them now or tonight?
It seems the waves are lousy now,

717
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,800
so they wanna look for another spot.

718
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,920
Let's stay here.
Or we'll look like groupies.

719
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,519
You're right.

720
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:00,639
Keep them hanging a bit.

721
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,039
Please hold for an advisor
to respond to your request.

722
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,239
That cold water feels great!

723
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,000
You're up!

724
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,239
They won't answer.
It's unbearable!

725
00:47:15,159 --> 00:47:17,000
What if I cut your hair?

726
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,320
Please!

727
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:23,519
A short bob would look great on you!

728
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,400
With bangs or without? Look
at me! Look at me!

729
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,000
No bangs, no bob.
And please get dressed.

730
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:33,800
Don't be such a prude!

731
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,920
I'm not a prude!
I adjust nude bodies at work every day.

732
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,559
It's just that...

733
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:42,719
If I could,
I'd traipse around naked all the time.

734
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,360
There's a hike in the Austrian Alps
my friends and I did.

735
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,320
We were all in the buff.
It clears your head!

736
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,119
We should do that for our next vacation.

737
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:57,079
No?
I'll stop torturing you!

738
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,760
So...

739
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,639
What'll I wear?

740
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:09,800
- What do you think of this?
- Very pretty.

741
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,199
We look like we're in
a Cindy Lauper look-alike contest!

742
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,199
Have a little confidence!
You look fabulous! Hold on!

743
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,159
Let's ask Elena to slip us a bottle.

744
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:24,800
Pull out my iPod!

745
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:26,920
Open the disco playlist.

746
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,840
Look for Candi Staton.

747
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,719
Young Hearts Run Free.

748
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,360
That's totally us!

749
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,800
Young hearts run free!

750
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,360
I love that!

751
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:08,320
That's for you! "Love only breaks up,
to start over again!"

752
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,679
Huh? Listen!

753
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:18,440
Hi, girls!

754
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,960
I fucking love vans!

755
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:25,920
Look, they built a fire.
How great!

756
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,199
You're the only adult on earth
who gets excited by a campfire.

757
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:37,400
No mystery there.
You're not excited by anything.

758
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,960
We're gonna sit on rocks,
freeze our butts off...

759
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,599
You are such a fucking pain in the ass!

760
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:44,679
I mean, really!

761
00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:48,719
It's no big surprise that...

762
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,239
- No surprise that...
- Nothing.

763
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,079
That my husband dumped me?

764
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:58,239
You were already like that in school.
Uptight.

765
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,000
We had to beg you
to do the slightest thing.

766
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:08,800
That's funny because you were a leader.
We all followed you like the pied piper.

767
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,320
Look where that got you!

768
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,920
I have no idea,
but maybe you'll tell me.

769
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,719
Let's join the Beach Boys,
since that's all you care about.

770
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,079
Oh, no!

771
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,159
Go on, tell me.
Since you seem to know me so well.

772
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,760
- Chickening out?
- Listen...

773
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,159
Magalie, I...

774
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,880
Let's not lie to ourselves.
This vacation was a bad idea.

775
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,159
Forced marriages have never worked.

776
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,320
Just because we were friends eons ago
doesn't mean we're still...

777
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,559
inseparable.

778
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,639
I agree.

779
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,920
But that's no reason to be contemptuous.

780
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,599
I don't judge you, even if
your life's shit and you stay there.

781
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:55,760
No, I'm sorry but...

782
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,320
You're in no position
to give me any lessons.

783
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,000
With those pop tune loops
that make you feel like you have a job.

784
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:05,199
Sorry, but...
Not you!

785
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,599
So you feel superior
in your white coat and Dr. Scholl's.

786
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:10,000
I earn my own living.

787
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,039
So I can be independent
and not mooch off other people.

788
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:16,880
Hold on!
Have I ever mooched off you?

789
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,679
Have I ever asked you
for one red cent?

790
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,679
I'm paying for everything.

791
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,639
Okay, you win! You can go
to your shitty posh hotel all alone.

792
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:28,760
Really?

793
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,840
- Hi!
- And what you plan to do?

794
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:34,599
I don't know, I'll stay here.

795
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:37,519
Or go to another island
and see my friends.

796
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:41,360
I may have no money, but I have friends.
I make friends!

797
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,079
I'm interested in others.

798
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,559
Cocktail hour!

799
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,000
That was a great spot
we found today.

800
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,199
A lot more wind than the first.

801
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,960
There were also sea urchins.
One bit my foot.

802
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:02,880
I really saw stars!

803
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:06,920
I'll move to the south of France,
open a tapas bar...

804
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:10,239
By the sea, of course.
That's a must.

805
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:12,280
Can you take me back?

806
00:52:13,159 --> 00:52:14,119
Already?

807
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:18,639
- I don't feel too well.
- Okay, we'll take the van.

808
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,239
What did I do with the keys?
Be right back!

809
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:29,079
- You leaving? Want the truck?
- No need.

810
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,440
Don't you wanna put on some music or...

811
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:39,760
- Whose ukulele is that?
- Only Maxime can play.

812
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:41,960
I'd like to try.

813
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,159
Thanks.

814
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,800
I had to look in all my pockets.

815
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,679
We can go, if you want.

816
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:43,079
Okay.

817
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,840
Thanks a lot.

818
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,880
Want me to come up and help you pack?

819
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,840
No, I think I can manage alone.

820
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:06,440
Don't worry, it'll be okay.

821
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,440
With Magalie. I'm sure it'll work out.

822
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,039
I'll be going.

823
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:21,360
Just 'cause we're on vacation
and the moon's sublime

824
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,480
doesn't mean we should kiss.

825
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,119
We're not like that.

826
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:27,039
No.

827
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:29,360
We don't fall into those clichés.

828
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,000
This time, I am going.

829
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,440
That's it?

830
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:00,119
That's already a lot for me,
I assure you.

831
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,519
Wait, I'll give you my number.

832
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:07,760
- Huh?
- Yes.

833
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,480
If you ever feel like
hopping on a train...

834
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,679
or have a yen for a Belgian beer...

835
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:17,800
Call me!

836
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,320
Elena!

837
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:01,719
Go away!

838
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,119
Blandine?
What are you doing here?

839
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,760
Can't you hear? We can't get in.

840
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,159
What do you mean?

841
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,400
A goat's blocking the door.
I've tried everything.

842
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,639
I even did that thing
fromManon of the Spring !

843
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,840
I won't do it now,
but it was very successful.

844
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:41,840
The result:
the whole herd showed up.

845
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,079
I beg you, do it again!

846
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,920
- Elena!
- Forget it, she's sound asleep.

847
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:56,880
My battery's almost dead.

848
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,480
Why didn't you bring your phone?

849
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,440
I don't like
to spend hours on that shit.

850
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,000
Especially not for online banking.

851
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:12,599
If it's just to tell me
I'm overdrawn again... No, thanks!

852
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,880
Okay...

853
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:21,920
What are you doing?

854
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:25,800
I have to stay awake.

855
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,000
Since it'll die
before the alarm rings.

856
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:32,440
You plan to sit upright all night?

857
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,719
I don't wanna miss the ferry.

858
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,760
- Okay.
- But maybe you're staying.

859
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:42,519
No, I'd rather be pampered in your spa.

860
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:46,440
And with Gaëtan...

861
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:48,440
A total bore.

862
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:52,719
You and Maxime?

863
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,000
- Very sweet.
- Yeah?

864
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:58,480
But... let's say we're worlds apart.

865
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:04,840
A guy who says, "I've got
the hots for you"... That's beyond me!

866
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:10,280
When he got back,
did you feel like he was disappointed?

867
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,559
Well, I mostly felt bored stiff.

868
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:17,599
And I thought...

869
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,400
you were right.
We should've stayed here.

870
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:23,639
We could've discussed Merkel's policies
with the old geezers.

871
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:28,320
Elena would've made us
a nice lamb moussaka, golden brown.

872
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,840
Aren't you a vegetarian?

873
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,360
Yeah.

874
00:58:32,119 --> 00:58:33,039
No more.

875
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,079
You know,
you shouldn't believe everything I say.

876
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:40,199
Me either. I...

877
00:58:41,159 --> 00:58:43,039
I can speak without thinking.

878
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:47,039
No, I was unsparing.
I said horrible things to you.

879
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,840
I'm ashamed... I apologize.

880
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,039
But your banjo song was spectacular.

881
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,840
Ukulele.

882
00:58:56,519 --> 00:58:57,800
An unusual instrument.

883
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,760
I was with a guy from California
for two years. A real one!

884
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,519
He taught me.

885
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:08,559
- I forgot you had such a pretty voice.
- Really?

886
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,079
That wasn't in your journal?
I'm a little offended.

887
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,960
Excuse me!

888
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,679
- Amorgos...
- Amorgos?

889
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:37,320
- Amorgos finish.
- What finish?

890
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,239
Too late. Amorgos 20 minutes before.
Now Mykonos.

891
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,320
Magalie!

892
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:47,079
We missed Amorgos!

893
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,000
We fell asleep and missed Amorgos!

894
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,679
Does everything make you laugh?

895
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:08,639
Everything makes you laugh!

896
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:12,000
Tomorrow!

897
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,000
There's a boat to Amorgos
tomorrow at 1 p.m.

898
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:17,639
Great!

899
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:19,440
MYKONOS

900
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:21,519
Stop petting that disgusting cat.

901
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,360
- You'll get mange.
- You're phobic!

902
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,679
Look how cute he is.
You're such a cutie!

903
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,920
What is that?
He's all scabby!

904
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:33,599
Disgusting!

905
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,760
- Fuck! Get lost!
- Here, clean your hands.

906
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:40,480
- What's that?
- Hydroalcoholic hand gel.

907
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:42,119
Okay.

908
01:00:42,199 --> 01:00:44,559
- And your friend?
- She's on her way.

909
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,599
- What's her name?
- Bijou.

910
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:50,440
Her real name's Lavinia.
Thanks Mom & Dad!

911
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,599
- So she prefers Bijou.
- And why Bijou?

912
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:55,800
Why not?

913
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:58,760
She's an artist and makes jewelry.

914
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:01,159
How'd you meet?

915
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,039
Here, three years ago.

916
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:08,039
At the Cavo Paradiso.
It's a well-known open-air club.

917
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:11,599
The cover charge is a little steep,
but great vibes.

918
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,639
The last time I was in a club
was with you, as kids.

919
01:01:16,519 --> 01:01:18,400
She knocks me out!

920
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,480
Sweetie!

921
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:29,719
- Honey bunch!
- I'm so happy to see you!

922
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,440
Bijou!

923
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,599
So you weren't even planning
to stop in Mykonos?

924
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:39,119
I'm hurt!

925
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:42,039
And that ring's not one of mine.

926
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,280
Eagle eye!

927
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,199
- Like it?
- It's gorgeous!

928
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,400
Then it's yours.
As a peace offering.

929
01:01:51,559 --> 01:01:54,719
I say that...
but I can't even get it off.

930
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,599
Shit!
This calls for desperate measures!

931
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,400
- Stop, Maggie! Forget it.
- It's my pleasure.

932
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,280
Then you get one of mine.
Which one! The blue?

933
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:08,440
- Pretty, huh?
- Superb!

934
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:09,559
Except...

935
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,239
I can't get mine off either!

936
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:18,239
Shall I buy tickets for tomorrow?

937
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:23,320
- Let me introduce you. I did it!
- Put it on me!

938
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,719
There!

939
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,559
- This is Blandine
- Hello, Bijou.

940
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:28,800
Hello!

941
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:30,960
This ring's spectacular!

942
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,719
- We were in middle school together.
- No way!

943
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,719
Yes!

944
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,400
Here!

945
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:38,960
There, miss!

946
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:40,920
It's magnificent!

947
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:45,920
- What's your name? Blandine?
- Yes, Blandine.

948
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,079
That's kind of a bummer...
Mind if I find you a new name?

949
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,719
So what's the plan?
Amorgos tomorrow?

950
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:56,360
- Yeah.
- You know, we have a boat.

951
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,400
We can take you there!

952
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,880
Here's what I suggest...

953
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:03,079
Spend the night at our place.

954
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:06,039
Take a dip in the pool,
we'll make a nice dinner.

955
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:09,800
And tomorrow we'll take a little cruise
as far as to Amorgos!

956
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,440
- How's that?
- Beyond our wildest dreams!

957
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:13,599
Thank you!

958
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:17,159
- And we lose a third night at my hotel.
- And keep quiet!

959
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:21,920
The only snafu is my car died,
so I had to rent a quad.

960
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,599
There's my pal, Léonidas!
I'll ask if he can take you, Blandine.

961
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,199
She knocks me out!

962
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:13,400
If you like Jacuzzis,
it's right over there!

963
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,239
I think we have a fan here!

964
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:22,239
And everything you see on the walls
is Dimitris' work.

965
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,719
And like me, you have the right
to find them completely hideous.

966
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:29,039
Does he know you don't like them?

967
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,920
I've never said it like that.
But I've never gushed either.

968
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:35,400
If you knew what they sell for!

969
01:04:37,719 --> 01:04:41,280
I think you're tough.
This one, I really like.

970
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,679
Yeah... Let's say it's the least ugly
(moche).

971
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:46,119
What is "moche"?

972
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:47,960
"Moche"...

973
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:53,480
Strong and beautiful.

974
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:57,159
So...
You are very "ugly"?

975
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,239
Sorry!

976
01:05:03,639 --> 01:05:05,960
I know,
it's not too appetizing but...

977
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,880
it's the best way to tenderize them.

978
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,159
- All settled in?
- Yes, thank you so much.

979
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,400
It's magnificent.

980
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:20,119
- Have you always lived here?
- I've lived all over the place!

981
01:05:20,199 --> 01:05:23,639
- I meant you and Dimitris.
- Well, I'm a freeloader.

982
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,199
At first, I had a room in Chora.

983
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:32,000
Then, soon after we met,
he asked me to move in with him.

984
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:33,800
I admit, I didn't hesitate.

985
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:35,840
Yeah!

986
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,079
It's funny, because
I wanted to divest myself of all that.

987
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,400
Luxury, big mansions...

988
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,039
royal families, all that!

989
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,719
She didn't tell you?
I was born in a castle in Kent.

990
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,519
But at 18, I chucked it all.

991
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,440
I traveled the world barefoot,
ashamed of being rich...

992
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:00,880
But then, over the years,
I started to like Ibiza, St. Barts...

993
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:02,880
And here I am!

994
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:06,599
In fact, we never change completely.

995
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:11,039
- I think I fixed the turntable.
- Fabulous! Dimitris!

996
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:14,000
Can you do this?
I'm just so tired...

997
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:17,400
- You are so tired...
- Yes. No, no, no.... Just do that!

998
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,039
Yes, yes, yes!

999
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,679
No, no, no... Okay, okay, okay!

1000
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,719
- Driving me crazy!
- He's the octopus!

1001
01:06:29,679 --> 01:06:31,599
What music do you wanna play?

1002
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,480
This!

1003
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,639
Super! I learned French
listening to those records.

1004
01:06:37,719 --> 01:06:38,840
Gimme a break!

1005
01:06:39,159 --> 01:06:43,679
But before we listen to anything,
we need an accessory

1006
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,599
that's indispensable.

1007
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:47,079
Yes.

1008
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:49,199
Come on, girls!

1009
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,400
- Here.
- No, thanks.

1010
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,559
- You don't like it?
- No.

1011
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,360
- Yes, my love?
- Have we got any opium?

1012
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,960
No, the joint's fine. Thanks.

1013
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:31,239
-So, how's Amorgos?
- Amorgos...

1014
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,039
Amorgos...

1015
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:44,360
In fact, Amorgos got complicated...

1016
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,920
It's sort of inaccessible, in fact.

1017
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,519
As an island!

1018
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,000
That's Benji?

1019
01:07:51,079 --> 01:07:53,519
- That's Benji!
- Hello...

1020
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:54,559
Bijou!

1021
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:57,679
We're "Benji's Angels"!

1022
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,119
Your son's handsome!

1023
01:08:00,519 --> 01:08:03,519
Get in line, right behind me!
Or a threesome...

1024
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:07,440
Stop! That's enough!
You, get out!

1025
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:10,519
Go on! Leave us alone!

1026
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:13,960
Wait, Bijou!
Can we roll another joint?

1027
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:17,640
- Did I hear that right?
- What?

1028
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,960
- That's why you're relaxed! You're high!
- Not at all.

1029
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:22,520
My eye!

1030
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:24,880
You've been toking giant doobies!

1031
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,479
No, it was just a teeny puff.

1032
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:30,640
Well, it did the trick!

1033
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:35,159
It's great! I love seeing you like that!
You look 10 years younger!

1034
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,319
Cell phones are off limits here.

1035
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,520
- Sorry, I'll hang up.
- Thanks.

1036
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:42,039
Where are you?

1037
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,840
-So how's the weather?
- Where are you?

1038
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,800
I'm...

1039
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,119
at the maternity hospital.

1040
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,880
Salomé had a baby girl.

1041
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,079
A little girl... Nice!

1042
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,760
What's her name?

1043
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:00,960
Her name's Ruby. With a Y.

1044
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,239
That's nice.

1045
01:09:03,319 --> 01:09:05,399
Perfect for a TV reality show.

1046
01:09:07,239 --> 01:09:08,600
You can't help yourself!

1047
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,159
Coming!

1048
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:15,399
I'll try to show her to you.

1049
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:17,279
Don't move!

1050
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:20,640
It's frozen!
The image is frozen...

1051
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,039
I understand!

1052
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:28,039
You shared intense experiences,
you had a kid...

1053
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,960
It's hard to turn the page.
But it's been two years now!

1054
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:36,039
Time to move on!
What do you think, Maggie?

1055
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:38,119
You're preaching to the converted.

1056
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:42,520
Yesterday, she had the chance
to move on with an ultra-cute surfer.

1057
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:47,159
- And?
- And nothing. Nada! Curtain!

1058
01:09:48,439 --> 01:09:51,079
For two years,
you've been playing goody-goody?

1059
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:56,239
I haven't been playing at anything!
I haven't felt the need to...

1060
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:04,359
No, sorry...

1061
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,039
Maybe you're afraid
of making a fool of yourself.

1062
01:10:08,119 --> 01:10:10,520
But don't tell me
you don't want to!

1063
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:14,159
That's impossible!
Sex is vital!

1064
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:16,439
It's as if I said,

1065
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:20,359
"I'm gonna stop eating.
But I'm fine, I don't feel the need."

1066
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,560
Yes! Exactly! Really!

1067
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,720
Listen to her.
Bijou's a virtuoso life coach!

1068
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:29,920
Make the most of that!

1069
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:33,920
Every piece of advice
is worth its weight in gold.

1070
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,319
It's true!
To me, you're a mentor.

1071
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:40,520
Is there a feminine version
of the word? "Mentress"?

1072
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:43,399
- Did you just say mentor?
- Yes.

1073
01:10:44,119 --> 01:10:47,079
Mentor is a Greek word.

1074
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:49,880
Yeah! He was in the Odysseus.

1075
01:10:50,359 --> 01:10:53,439
He was in charge of Telemachus.
And the whole palace.

1076
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,600
Thank you, Dimitris.

1077
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:01,720
I should explain.
To Dimitris, everything is Greek.

1078
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,520
When he does that, just nod.

1079
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:07,479
- Yes! Okay!
- Do you understand?

1080
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,720
Yeah!

1081
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:11,560
Darling, we have that salad now, please.

1082
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,560
The salad?

1083
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:15,199
Yes...

1084
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:20,800
So, where was I?

1085
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,880
Right, you!
I'm not gonna let up!

1086
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,439
Excuse me, but...

1087
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,159
aren't joints supposed to relax you?

1088
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:31,000
You're more excited than before.

1089
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:34,079
That story of yours makes me crazy!

1090
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,520
I won't let you waste away!

1091
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,960
Waste away...

1092
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:39,279
Look...

1093
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:42,079
If you'd like to get back in the saddle,

1094
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:45,159
I can easily ask Dimitris.

1095
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:50,840
And it's my idea,
so I won't go into a jealous rage.

1096
01:11:51,399 --> 01:11:52,880
I love it!

1097
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,640
She's kidding?

1098
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,960
Not at all.
If I can do you that favor...

1099
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:02,079
No, Bijou!

1100
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,079
Don't ask him anything!

1101
01:12:15,960 --> 01:12:17,520
He's not your type?

1102
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,119
No big deal.

1103
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:25,359
I just said "Dimitris" because he was
at hand. But we could easily ask...

1104
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,600
Léonidas, the cab driver. He's single!

1105
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,800
Now you're sounding
a little like a "madam".

1106
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:36,760
What?
No! Hold on!

1107
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,880
I'm just trying to help
and you call me names?

1108
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,520
- Then it's your problem!
- Exactly.

1109
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:45,920
Can I have some wine?
It's good, the Retsina.

1110
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:47,760
Very good.

1111
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,720
Well, I'd be interested in Léonidas,
if you'd put us in touch.

1112
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,000
Someone's sensible!

1113
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:19,880
Blandine!

1114
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:25,000
He can be so conventional at times!

1115
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,359
What's the matter?

1116
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,079
When I went to rent the quad today,
I was early.

1117
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:38,000
I wasn't gonna come back home,
so I waited with the salesman.

1118
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:42,920
He was in his 20s,
very cute, and so we...

1119
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,800
It's a way of passing time.
But I have principles!

1120
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,920
I think you should be honest.

1121
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:51,479
No use hiding it!

1122
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:56,039
There are two schools of thought.

1123
01:13:56,119 --> 01:13:58,479
And I decided to tell Dimitris.

1124
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,960
And did you hear the tantrum he threw?

1125
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:03,640
The guy's sick!

1126
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:07,840
Plus, what does he have to fear?

1127
01:14:08,279 --> 01:14:10,640
I'm not gonna hook up with a kid!
Drink up.

1128
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,399
I think it's touching.

1129
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:18,520
It means he loves you,
he's attached to you.

1130
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,640
Love isn't possession!

1131
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,119
It's the 21st century. Shit!

1132
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:25,199
That, I can't tolerate!

1133
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:28,960
You know,
we could take the ferry tomorrow...

1134
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:30,800
No!

1135
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:34,720
We said we'd take you, and we will.

1136
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,359
He may throw me overboard but...

1137
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,720
- How is it?
- Delicious!

1138
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,560
Alley-oop!

1139
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:47,239
Buck naked!

1140
01:14:55,479 --> 01:14:57,079
Maggie's not back?

1141
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,199
I don't think so.

1142
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:03,760
She said you were a doctor?

1143
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:06,720
No, I'm a radiology technician.

1144
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:08,800
Okay.

1145
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:13,479
- But you work in a hospital!
- No, in an office.

1146
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,960
Good night.

1147
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,079
Blandine...

1148
01:15:25,079 --> 01:15:26,079
Yes?

1149
01:15:29,560 --> 01:15:30,880
X-rays...

1150
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:33,439
Do you know how to read them?

1151
01:15:34,439 --> 01:15:36,399
Yes, that is part of my job.

1152
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:40,800
- You did see I was missing one?
- One what?

1153
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,800
You see? If you'd stop being
so modest and looking away

1154
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,199
to avoid seeing me naked,
you'd see I only have one breast.

1155
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:53,560
What did I do with those things?

1156
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,960
It was either that
or kick the bucket!

1157
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,479
I had the works!

1158
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:04,479
Mastectomy, radiation, chemo!

1159
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:06,720
They didn't let up.

1160
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:10,680
- You poor dear.
- No, I'm clearly still having a ball.

1161
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,960
The guys I meet
turn out to be very understanding.

1162
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,920
And it's a real plus for archery!

1163
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:23,960
So last week,

1164
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:26,640
we stopped in Athens.

1165
01:16:29,319 --> 01:16:32,000
And I had a mammogram
on what's left.

1166
01:16:33,399 --> 01:16:36,159
I didn't tell Dimitris.
I said I was shopping.

1167
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,560
But now they want me to have a biopsy.

1168
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:45,319
So?

1169
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:49,239
So...

1170
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:57,239
There is a suspicious mass
in the upper quadrant.

1171
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:03,520
So they didn't make a mistake.

1172
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:11,239
I ask because I was hoping these
Greeks were idiots about this stuff.

1173
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,920
Yes, but as Dimitris would say,

1174
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,159
they did invent medicine.

1175
01:17:17,239 --> 01:17:19,520
But it may just be fibroids.

1176
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,039
Or a benign tumor.

1177
01:17:22,359 --> 01:17:24,359
That's what the biopsy's for.

1178
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:29,319
You're sweet to reassure me, but...

1179
01:17:29,399 --> 01:17:30,960
I know the old song.

1180
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:32,920
Even I could see the spot.

1181
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:34,920
It's huge.

1182
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,199
They'll start bombarding me again...

1183
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:41,880
What a fucking pain!

1184
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,199
I don't want to.

1185
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:50,560
But no big deal!

1186
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,359
I won't let it beat me.

1187
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,960
I'll get treatment and I'll get better.

1188
01:17:56,359 --> 01:17:57,600
And you!

1189
01:17:58,199 --> 01:18:02,239
Accept this divorce and look alive!
Okay?

1190
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,319
Because we're fighters!

1191
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,920
We're amazons!
And I'm a bitch.

1192
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:12,119
Why'd I do that to Dimitris?

1193
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,920
I guess, when this happened again...

1194
01:18:19,479 --> 01:18:24,039
I felt that screwing around
would make me feel alive.

1195
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,560
That I'd be invincible.

1196
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:28,039
I understand.

1197
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,640
Magalie's back!

1198
01:18:35,159 --> 01:18:36,640
Tell her we're in here.

1199
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:53,640
Oh, Blandine!

1200
01:18:57,800 --> 01:18:59,119
It was really...

1201
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:01,000
such a blast!

1202
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:06,279
I've always found Léonidas chocolates
nauseating, but him...

1203
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:09,359
I could wolf down four boxes in a row!

1204
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:12,199
He taught me to play backgammon.

1205
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:15,199
Bijou!

1206
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:20,359
Did you know Léonidas
was a backgammon champ?

1207
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,439
He plays in tournaments and everything!

1208
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:29,359
We sat on his balcony and started
to play. He destroyed me, of course!

1209
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:33,239
But he said, for a beginner,
I had a certain savoir-faire!

1210
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,760
Wait! You know,
they're having a party next door!

1211
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,720
This is horrible!

1212
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,600
I can't take it anymore.
My ears are bleeding!

1213
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:05,560
Here goes!

1214
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,439
Enough!

1215
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,640
Oh, shit!

1216
01:20:14,359 --> 01:20:18,960
- Hello, you need something?
- Yeah! You know what's in here?

1217
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:20,159
No... I don't know.

1218
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:24,520
This music will make you
the best DJ in the world!

1219
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:26,960
Really? Okay!

1220
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:30,319
- Which song?
- Put Candice Staton.

1221
01:20:30,399 --> 01:20:33,000
Candice Staton? Alright!

1222
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,119
What are you doing, guys?
What happenes?

1223
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,640
What? But look,
everybody loves this music...

1224
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:27,520
Put Lost in Music by Chic.
It's a classic one!

1225
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:21,800
What can I say?
You weren't too cool.

1226
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:26,000
- But neither was he.
- Bullshit!

1227
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,159
They're your neighbors.
I got you in deep shit!

1228
01:22:29,239 --> 01:22:31,960
I hate myself.
I'm fucking ashamed!

1229
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,840
All my psychoanalysis down the tubes.
In two seconds, I turn into that asshole!

1230
01:22:37,239 --> 01:22:39,640
What asshole? Oh, right!

1231
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,279
Anyway, I don't blame you.

1232
01:23:02,199 --> 01:23:03,119
Saw you!

1233
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:07,600
Your iPod still works! That's cool.

1234
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:08,880
Yeah.

1235
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:15,600
Wanna talk about last night?

1236
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:16,920
God, no!

1237
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:19,880
Let's move on.

1238
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,680
To clear my head,
I went out afterwards.

1239
01:23:23,079 --> 01:23:24,000
Really?

1240
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:26,880
I went to Cavo Paradiso.

1241
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:28,960
I felt like dancing.

1242
01:23:29,319 --> 01:23:31,680
I wanted to be allowed to dance.

1243
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,199
Good choice!

1244
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:36,399
The music was insane!

1245
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,199
Great!

1246
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:39,640
You didn't just dance.

1247
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:43,720
- What?
- You have a hickey!

1248
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:45,039
Really?

1249
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,159
Yeah, well...

1250
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,920
I was pretty drunk. I let loose.

1251
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,039
Tell all!

1252
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,079
I don't really remember much.

1253
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,199
Did you go to a hotel?

1254
01:24:00,680 --> 01:24:03,119
No, just to a nearby beach.

1255
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,119
Okay, a power nap.

1256
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:14,960
Blandine!

1257
01:24:17,079 --> 01:24:20,680
We're gonna make a detour
to an inlet we know. Okay?

1258
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:22,119
Great!

1259
01:24:24,199 --> 01:24:25,640
Things are better.

1260
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:27,880
- Yeah.
- What did you say?

1261
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:29,239
That he was "ugly".

1262
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,439
I said I felt bad about it.

1263
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,560
That I was sorry and I loved him.

1264
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:38,399
It's good to be
conventional sometimes.

1265
01:24:40,119 --> 01:24:41,920
And I told him about the biopsy.

1266
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,800
We're going to Mykonos
to do it tomorrow.

1267
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:50,560
That way, if I have to
go through all that again...

1268
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,680
I can buy a nice wig.

1269
01:24:53,079 --> 01:24:56,880
- We don't know that yet.
- No, just in case. You never know!

1270
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,680
This time, I'd like to go '60s!
Sort of a beehive.

1271
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,079
A little Divine, or B-52s!

1272
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:08,079
That's it! Divine!

1273
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:10,079
What?

1274
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,239
Not "Blandine", "Divine"!

1275
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,199
We keep the "ine",
but lose the bland side.

1276
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:18,680
From now on, I'm calling you "Divine"!

1277
01:25:20,840 --> 01:25:23,920
Enough, okay?
See you...

1278
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:29,399
Sorry! Bye, bye!
You're taking me away from my friend.

1279
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,760
Why not stay with us
instead of going to Amorgos?

1280
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,359
During the dictatorship,
they sent political enemies there.

1281
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:38,880
Creepy Amorgos!

1282
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:44,720
But Blandine promised herself...

1283
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,199
We promised!

1284
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:50,119
True! We promised we'd go
to the island inThe Big Blue.

1285
01:25:50,199 --> 01:25:52,520
- The one with Rosanna?
- Yes.

1286
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,600
I never saw that film,
but she's so nice!

1287
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:57,279
I'm not surprised.

1288
01:25:57,359 --> 01:25:59,520
She's Yoko's best friend.

1289
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,439
- You know Rosanna Arquette?
- Sure. She's great!

1290
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:06,800
Way into Ayurvedic massages
and energy crystals,

1291
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,680
but we've had a lot of laughs.

1292
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:13,159
Didn't you go to her place in Santa Fe?

1293
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,079
Do you know lots of celebrities?

1294
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:19,159
Yes, but I never recognize them.

1295
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:24,840
Someone had to tell me that
the Yoko in question was Yoko Ono.

1296
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,119
To me, she was just
a Japanese woman in a big hat.

1297
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:29,880
I love that!

1298
01:26:30,199 --> 01:26:32,960
Let's go over there.
This side's for the rich.

1299
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:34,640
Yeah.

1300
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,680
The water's amazing!

1301
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,600
I'm trying to learn Greek,
but it's impossible.

1302
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,600
Really?

1303
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:17,159
Shit! I'm so bummed out.

1304
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:20,000
- What's wrong?
- I got a job.

1305
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:21,720
So?

1306
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:26,119
I just got a cable music show
that starts in the fall.

1307
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,399
What a drag!
I had a feeling they took a shine to me.

1308
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,079
It could be fun!

1309
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:35,720
They're already talking
about a full-time job.

1310
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,199
I know the drill!
"Magalie, I'll take the lead."

1311
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:42,000
"I expect you to be proactive!"
All that crap!

1312
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:46,640
- But you were looking for a job!
- Not like that. I'm freelance!

1313
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,319
And freelance includes the word "free".

1314
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,560
You're right.

1315
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,119
- Let it go.
- Okay.

1316
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:03,319
We'll see! Yeah! Let's see.

1317
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,000
Yeah!

1318
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:08,600
- She's winning all the time!
- She's winning?

1319
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,239
Amorgos!

1320
01:28:15,479 --> 01:28:17,000
Blandine, Amorgos!

1321
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:31,600
AMORGOS

1322
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:33,399
Geeze...

1323
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:36,279
That movie's their bread and butter!
Look!

1324
01:28:36,359 --> 01:28:40,239
They have cups,
key rings, place mats...

1325
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:41,920
It's Disneyland!

1326
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,039
But with a bit more charm!

1327
01:28:45,159 --> 01:28:46,079
Thank you.

1328
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,479
Girls, your van is here.

1329
01:28:50,439 --> 01:28:52,760
- Sure you don't want anything?
- I'm fine.

1330
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,840
It's pretty with the belt.

1331
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,399
Let's take a beautiful selfie
before you go.

1332
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,239
It's really nice!

1333
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:10,640
Lots of teeth!

1334
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,000
- I don't wanna leave you!
- No!

1335
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:22,760
One last picture with Bijou!
Here!

1336
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:32,960
Is that Maxime?

1337
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,520
When were these taken?

1338
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,439
- Who's Maxime?
- The surfer she turned down.

1339
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:43,760
- Really?
- So?

1340
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:47,399
He was at Cavo Paradiso last night.
He's cute!

1341
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:48,920
Let's go!

1342
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,520
He was the guy on the beach?

1343
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:52,960
What do you care?
You blew him off.

1344
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:57,319
You had your pick,
and the one you screw is Maxime!

1345
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:01,680
What's the problem?
You said he wasn't your type.

1346
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,800
Then why'd you hide it?
You'd have admitted it.

1347
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:08,479
I admit it. Happy?

1348
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:09,880
Let's go!

1349
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,640
Why do you always
have to ruin everything?

1350
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:17,399
- Take it easy! Calm down.
- Why didn't you call to tell me?

1351
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:20,199
Didn't you think
I'd be happy to see him?

1352
01:30:20,279 --> 01:30:24,359
Didn't I say I needed time?
That I can't do it on the first date?

1353
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:28,359
If I saw him again,
maybe I'd see him differently.

1354
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:33,600
You're mad at me
for not waking you up at 4 AM,

1355
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:36,920
to see a guy
you claim you don't give a damn about?

1356
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
- Is that it?
- In fact, you're vicious.

1357
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,560
Yes, you're vicious.

1358
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:44,399
You only think of yourself.
You're selfish!

1359
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:49,159
This is exactly what happened
with Nicolas Fiévet!

1360
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,439
Wow!

1361
01:30:52,439 --> 01:30:55,920
- That's the cherry on the cake!
- Who's Nicolas Fiévet?

1362
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:01,239
He's a kid she's accusing me
of stealing from her in middle school.

1363
01:31:01,319 --> 01:31:05,520
- That's what this is about.
- You gonna pretend it's not true?

1364
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,680
That I made it all up?

1365
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,920
And I never found my letter
in your fucking notebook?

1366
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,359
I never went out
with Nicolas Fiévet, okay?

1367
01:31:14,439 --> 01:31:16,359
I never even considered it.

1368
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,920
If you found your fucking letter in
my notebook, maybe I couldn't deliver it.

1369
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,600
Back then, my life was complicated.

1370
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:28,079
I couldn't always do what I wanted
or what you asked.

1371
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:32,600
While your biggest problem
was a love letter to Nicolas Fiévet,

1372
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:34,640
I had other nightmares to deal with.

1373
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:38,159
Get it? No, you don't!
You were blind.

1374
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:41,600
In your tidy little world,
with nothing out of place.

1375
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:45,119
Where a letter
is inevitably delivered.

1376
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:49,319
And I'm the one who's selfish?
I should apologize?

1377
01:31:49,399 --> 01:31:51,119
When you were so unfair.

1378
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,600
I staged a sit-in outside your house.
Remember that?

1379
01:31:55,319 --> 01:31:58,000
I begged you for hours
because I needed you.

1380
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:00,479
I was in pain!

1381
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,479
And all you said was, "Get lost!"

1382
01:32:04,039 --> 01:32:05,319
Because with my...

1383
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,359
In any case, we'll never make it,
you and I. We won't make it.

1384
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,319
I'm coming with you.

1385
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:46,840
Hello...

1386
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:48,840
Hello!

1387
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:53,880
Bijou? She's making necklaces
in the backyard!

1388
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:56,319
Divine!

1389
01:34:57,119 --> 01:34:59,039
It's so nice you came back!

1390
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:04,239
Celebrate with us tonight!
I just got my biopsy results.

1391
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,840
- It's benign.
- That's great!

1392
01:35:08,359 --> 01:35:10,319
I'm so happy for you.

1393
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:12,840
I'm so happy for my hair!

1394
01:35:14,199 --> 01:35:16,880
- You looking for Magalie?
- Yes.

1395
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:18,479
She went back to Paris.

1396
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:21,560
She was very sad.

1397
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:24,479
So she called her new boss
to start early.

1398
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:34,119
You can't blame yourself
for not knowing, if she never told you.

1399
01:35:34,199 --> 01:35:36,399
But we were so close, so...

1400
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:38,079
inseparable.

1401
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:41,920
I thought we told each other everything.

1402
01:35:43,479 --> 01:35:47,000
And she meets you in a club...
I don't want to be rude but...

1403
01:35:47,079 --> 01:35:51,199
She tells you her father beat her
and she escaped with her mother.

1404
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,279
I swear, we were constantly together.

1405
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,840
She was always at my house.

1406
01:35:57,560 --> 01:35:59,279
And I was never at her house.

1407
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,760
That was a sign.
I should have suspected something.

1408
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,119
She's right, I was blind.

1409
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:09,199
You couldn't see anything.
She couldn't say anything.

1410
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:12,039
It's complicated, you were so young.

1411
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:16,880
Maybe Magalie was happy
to forget her problems with you.

1412
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:18,600
You helped her, too.

1413
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,800
Why not tell me now?

1414
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,039
It's not easy.
You were on vacation...

1415
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,960
- You were on vacation, too.
- Listen...

1416
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:31,640
Magalie renewed your friendship
because your son called,

1417
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,239
saying you were in very bad shape
and in a deep depression.

1418
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,880
She just wanted to bring you some joy.

1419
01:36:41,479 --> 01:36:42,960
Some joy.

1420
01:36:56,399 --> 01:36:57,319
Here...

1421
01:36:58,560 --> 01:36:59,520
A present!

1422
01:37:03,279 --> 01:37:04,920
Thank you so much!

1423
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:34,439
A star is born! Welcome to Ruby
& congratulations to her parents.

1424
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:35,880
Blandine

1425
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:46,560
I'm here to see Magalie Graulières.

1426
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:48,119
One sec...

1427
01:37:50,079 --> 01:37:51,520
Do you have an appointment?

1428
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:53,920
Yes, I do.

1429
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,039
- Magalie's not here.
- Oh, no!

1430
01:37:56,119 --> 01:37:59,239
Not here, she's downstairs now.

1431
01:37:59,319 --> 01:38:03,800
That's what the receptionist said.
But the sign says it's a kids' channel.

1432
01:38:04,359 --> 01:38:05,720
You know Magalie!

1433
01:38:05,800 --> 01:38:06,960
Good luck.

1434
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:18,720
Wait!

1435
01:38:19,319 --> 01:38:21,359
No, please... Cut!

1436
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:26,000
Please, bring me an apple box.
I feel like a dwarf!

1437
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:27,920
I'll never make it!

1438
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:31,720
I'm struggling!
I don't know if Lucas is here?

1439
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,199
From the top! Can we do it
without music? Great!

1440
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,039
Let's go!

1441
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:46,600
Léontine! I'm cooing!
That's your cue.

1442
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,319
Hello, Gladine, the pigeon!

1443
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:50,439
Hello, Léontine!

1444
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,760
- I'm happy to see you.
- I brought binoculars.

1445
01:38:55,439 --> 01:38:57,239
That's what binoculars are?

1446
01:38:57,319 --> 01:38:59,319
Great!
We can see the Paris rooftops.

1447
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,880
I don't have to fly to the Eiffel Tower!

1448
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,920
This is so great!

1449
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:15,239
Excuse me!
Can we take a break?

1450
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:19,680
We'll pick up in 10 minutes.
Be right back!

1451
01:39:28,439 --> 01:39:31,960
- What are you doing here?
- And what are you doing here?

1452
01:39:35,199 --> 01:39:39,359
I was bored to tears
on their dumb music show.

1453
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,039
I met some people from this show
in the cafeteria.

1454
01:39:44,680 --> 01:39:48,000
I came to see one of their tapings.
I loved it, so here I am!

1455
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:50,560
Excuse me.
You okay, Léontine?

1456
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:52,760
I'm not sure I can do the next song.

1457
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:55,680
No biggie! I'll do it.
What did we say?

1458
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:58,279
Rule number 1:
Nothing's obligatory.

1459
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,000
Thanks, Magalie!

1460
01:40:01,319 --> 01:40:03,600
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

1461
01:40:05,079 --> 01:40:06,359
I just barged in...

1462
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:10,319
I'm sorry for...

1463
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:12,960
not measuring up.

1464
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:19,279
- I don't know if Bijou told you...
- Yes, she did.

1465
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:24,319
I don't agree
with what you said in Amorgos.

1466
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,840
I do think we can make it.

1467
01:40:30,359 --> 01:40:31,479
Absolutely!

1468
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:33,640
I'm sure of it.

1469
01:40:39,640 --> 01:40:43,199
I missed you so much
I bought a disco compilation.

1470
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,520
No, don't ever do that!

1471
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:50,000
Those things are shit!
They're made using algorithms.

1472
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:53,039
I'll make you a compilation
and it'll make sense.

1473
01:40:53,399 --> 01:40:54,439
Because...

1474
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,239
Disco's not just music.

1475
01:40:58,199 --> 01:41:00,439
It's a protest movement.

1476
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:03,680
It's choosing to dance to forget.

1477
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,680
Choosing lightness.
Choosing to be carefree.

1478
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:18,359
Let me be sure I have my iPod...

1479
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:21,319
In case the DJ's lousy.

1480
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:27,680
We're safe!

1481
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:29,560
Who's throwing this party?

1482
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:33,760
A friend of a friend
of a friend of a friend.

1483
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:35,840
We'll see soon!

1484
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:38,279
By the way...

1485
01:41:38,720 --> 01:41:40,800
Remember my
electric company problem?

1486
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,199
They made a mistake.

1487
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,079
No way?

1488
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:47,000
What a relief!

1489
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:49,640
I was losing sleep over it!

1490
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:51,399
I even told my new shrink.

1491
01:41:51,479 --> 01:41:54,000
I couldn't deal with the stress!

1492
01:41:54,079 --> 01:41:57,359
Thank you!
Now I can breathe again!

1493
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,840
Look!

1494
01:42:01,239 --> 01:42:02,279
Holy shit!

1495
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:34,079
Be right back!

1496
01:42:35,239 --> 01:42:37,600
Excuse me, what size are you?

1497
01:42:38,119 --> 01:42:39,319
Hello.

1498
01:42:39,399 --> 01:42:41,399
Hello. Your shoe size?

1499
01:42:42,319 --> 01:42:43,720
Nine and a half. Why?

1500
01:42:44,119 --> 01:42:46,279
Would you like
to make someone happy?

1501
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:01,800
Blandine!
