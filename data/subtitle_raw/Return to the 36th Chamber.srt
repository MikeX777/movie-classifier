1
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:19,832
Chiang Tai Dye Mill

2
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,894
Ah Sheng,
the dye has been quite bad of late

3
00:01:27,094 --> 00:01:28,809
The color doesn't stay

4
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:35,951
That's right, someone must be behind this

5
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,624
Sheng bro, the chief wants to talk to you

6
00:01:41,337 --> 00:01:42,733
Sir, is this OK?

7
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:44,049
It's all right

8
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,906
Brother Sheng

9
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,748
Chief

10
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:10,700
Look at this, how come it's like this?

11
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,937
How can this be acceptable?

12
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,286
Our dye is a little...

13
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:17,762
A little what?

14
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:22,988
It's the same dye

15
00:02:27,736 --> 00:02:29,810
See, theirs is much darker

16
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,965
Why is our dye lighter?

17
00:02:32,404 --> 00:02:35,196
Maybe we need to concentrate it a little

18
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:36,593
What's the matter?

19
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,146
They are from Manchuria

20
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:41,500
Our boss hired them

21
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,375
To mix the colors

22
00:02:43,575 --> 00:02:44,652
Then I...

23
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,921
Don't worry! You can still work here

24
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,354
They have come to assist you

25
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,102
I have no problem in that

26
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:59,294
But I have to go talk to the others

27
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:02,047
There's no need; you do your own thing

28
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:03,603
They have their own jobs

29
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:04,640
I'm afraid it will delay work

30
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:05,238
Yes

31
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:06,914
The colors will be a mess

32
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:11,023
Relax, we brought our color sticks

33
00:03:11,223 --> 00:03:12,180
Look

34
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:23,750
What do you need the rods for?

35
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:28,697
This is the special tool from Manchuria

36
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,868
It's quite special

37
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:42,462
So it's got to be alright

38
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,135
The boss said, from today onwards...

39
00:03:45,254 --> 00:03:47,010
You will have a pay cut of 20 percent

40
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:47,808
Why?

41
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:49,044
Why do we have to bear a pay cut?

42
00:03:49,164 --> 00:03:50,321
You wish to know the reason?

43
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,391
The 20 percent is so we can pay them

44
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:55,787
That's not right

45
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:57,383
That's highway robbery

46
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:01,692
You Manchurians shouldn't be violent

47
00:04:01,811 --> 00:04:03,168
You should be reasonable

48
00:04:04,006 --> 00:04:07,676
Brother Sheng...

49
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,506
This is the most sensible thing

50
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,578
What do you want to do?

51
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:16,493
Brother Sheng...

52
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,084
You...

53
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:22,717
Ah Chao, Shih Sheng, stop messing around

54
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,906
Why are you hitting... it's unreasonable

55
00:04:27,026 --> 00:04:29,699
Stop fighting; stop it

56
00:04:29,818 --> 00:04:33,289
Our fabric is getting worse recently

57
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:35,324
That's why our boss
is hiring the technicians

58
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:38,835
Yuan Li Hou and Chuan Min are here

59
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:39,912
To help you

60
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:41,588
It's because of the Manchurians

61
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,181
We have to take a pay cut

62
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,336
Be quiet

63
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:47,413
This is the boss' idea

64
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:49,487
Take it or leave it

65
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:56,230
Then I'll be the first to leave

66
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:57,307
Chou Shih Sheng

67
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:58,464
I'll quit too

68
00:04:58,584 --> 00:04:59,262
Me too

69
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:00,060
I'm also leaving

70
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,818
So am I

71
00:05:00,938 --> 00:05:01,616
I'll go too

72
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,454
Count me in

73
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,648
I'm not going to stay either

74
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:08,398
Let's go... l'll go too

75
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:09,795
Stop

76
00:05:11,191 --> 00:05:13,824
What a nerve, Chou Shih Sheng!

77
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:15,859
You started a strike

78
00:05:16,776 --> 00:05:19,090
Whoever dares to leave the mill...

79
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,527
I'll break his legs

80
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:23,519
Move away

81
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:29,583
Move it...

82
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:37,522
You want to fight

83
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,195
Stop fighting

84
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,353
I'll break your legs

85
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:05,490
Don't fight anymore

86
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:16,182
Chuan Min,
you cant' even beat the women

87
00:06:20,052 --> 00:06:23,523
We'll beat you! Goddamn Manchurian

88
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,832
Cut it out...

89
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:32,260
All right, chief

90
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,295
We'll follow his orders

91
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,806
And take the pay cut

92
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:40,439
Now go back to work

93
00:06:41,037 --> 00:06:41,995
Ah Chao

94
00:06:42,114 --> 00:06:43,591
Are you alright?

95
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:48,298
Chief Ma recruited some Manchurians

96
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:49,974
And made us take a pay cut

97
00:06:50,094 --> 00:06:52,607
They are violent and looking for fights

98
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,876
They must've planned it before, Shih Seng

99
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:58,711
Uncle Li, you've been here for a long time

100
00:06:58,831 --> 00:07:01,344
We have been earning a lot for him

101
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:04,696
You're the color specialist in Chiang Tai

102
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:07,289
The raw materials are worse than before

103
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:09,723
I knew it would not work

104
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:13,393
All right,
we should go to talk to the boss

105
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,901
It's no use fighting against Manchurians

106
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:20,096
The boss himself hired them

107
00:07:21,412 --> 00:07:23,726
Well... Mr. Li

108
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:25,482
Can we go to the court?

109
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:28,833
That's worse; let me tell you why

110
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:33,262
Boss holds influence in their court

111
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:38,767
Can't sue him and get beaten up
if we don't work

112
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:41,201
If we work we receive less money

113
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,470
Who knows how much they'll deduct later!

114
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,744
Why do we even bother coming to work?

115
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:48,622
How I wish that we knew some Kung Fu

116
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,699
Ah Chao

117
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,853
We'd fight them if we knew how

118
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:53,409
Don't worry about bruises and injury

119
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:56,601
Our wonder pills from Shaolin...

120
00:07:58,117 --> 00:07:59,394
heal all bruises

121
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:02,625
Cures cuts

122
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:05,298
lmproves circulation

123
00:08:06,894 --> 00:08:09,128
You can eat half and rub the rest on

124
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,879
Better than candy, I'd say

125
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,748
In my opinion we should continue working

126
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:19,182
Rather not create a scene with them

127
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:24,648
True, let's avoid getting beaten up

128
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,433
You're all here

129
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:32,986
Hey, don't rush...

130
00:08:33,066 --> 00:08:34,901
This can cure it...

131
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,771
You're lucky, sir

132
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,404
Take the whole box; go ahead...

133
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:44,277
What the hell are you doing? Ah Chieh

134
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:48,107
Our work is different from yours

135
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,102
We have to pretend to be someone

136
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:52,256
To be a monkey you need to look like one

137
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:54,091
To be a monk you need to be bald

138
00:08:54,211 --> 00:08:56,565
They always fall for it

139
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:01,313
How come you're all free tonight?

140
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:04,983
Our boss hired
a whole bunch of Manchurians

141
00:09:05,103 --> 00:09:07,576
We need to give up pay for them

142
00:09:07,696 --> 00:09:09,531
Your brother got into a fight with them

143
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:12,164
Ah Chao got hurt too

144
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,595
Let me look at it, Ah Chao

145
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:16,433
What are you doing?

146
00:09:16,553 --> 00:09:18,747
You dare to sell me fake medicine

147
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,822
What are you talking about?

148
00:09:20,942 --> 00:09:23,216
My medicine is really from Shaolin Temple

149
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:25,968
Do you really think you're a monk?

150
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:27,165
Aren't I?

151
00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:29,439
The monks from Shaolin know martial arts

152
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,075
Well, so do I

153
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,549
Good then, go get revenge for Ah Chao

154
00:09:33,668 --> 00:09:34,706
Don't push me into it

155
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,299
I can't use my skills for revenge

156
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:39,453
It's for peaceful purposes

157
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:41,169
What the hell is that kind of martial arts?

158
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,326
It's only for a living

159
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:43,124
Don't lie

160
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:44,361
Who is lying?

161
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,672
Shut up, let's go Ah Chieh

162
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:53,377
Thanks, I'm leaving now

163
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:04,269
Li Se, donate twenty cents

164
00:10:06,663 --> 00:10:10,094
Merciful Buddha,
Shaolin Temple needs fixing

165
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:13,445
Please donate some money

166
00:10:13,565 --> 00:10:15,121
Move it, I don't have...

167
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,913
Your goodness will be aptly rewarded

168
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:18,831
He is over there

169
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,507
It's really him! Let's go over to see him

170
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:21,584
Is that OK?

171
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:22,781
Don't worry

172
00:10:23,978 --> 00:10:26,012
Gentleman, Lady, Shaolin need repairs

173
00:10:26,132 --> 00:10:27,967
Donate some money to help out?

174
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:29,364
Chu Jen Chieh

175
00:10:29,443 --> 00:10:31,119
What, it's you

176
00:10:31,438 --> 00:10:33,553
You're really good at this

177
00:10:33,672 --> 00:10:36,625
Of course, otherwise all those...

178
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:40,016
All those dummies wouldn't fall for it

179
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:41,612
We'd like you to pretend to be a monk

180
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:44,125
And take revenge for us with your kung fu

181
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:49,112
Don't count on me; they will kill me

182
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,229
Are you Chu Shih Seng's brother?

183
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:50,788
Yes, I am

184
00:10:50,908 --> 00:10:51,785
Are you our friend?

185
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:52,304
Of course

186
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:53,621
You see, they took advantage of us

187
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,698
Are you going to help?

188
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:55,296
I will

189
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,932
What are you waiting for?

190
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:58,328
Hi, big fellow

191
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:01,241
I'm not really a Shaolin monk

192
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,597
I'm just pretending to be one

193
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:04,911
That's it; let's go...

194
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,108
We'll tell you the details

195
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:07,544
Let's talk about it when we get home

196
00:11:33,637 --> 00:11:36,070
I know this is for stirring yellow

197
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:44,768
Do you like the other shades of yellow?

198
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:45,885
What other kinds of yellow?

199
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:55,260
Are you playing with me?

200
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:57,375
Hsiao Hung

201
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:10,860
There are too many people here, hold on

202
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:15,169
She'll bring out the yellow fabric later

203
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:16,485
You just follow her

204
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:31,803
Hsiao Hung

205
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:46,405
What are you doing here?

206
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:49,078
And you?

207
00:12:50,634 --> 00:12:53,307
Why are you here? Ah Chuan

208
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:57,576
I'm... here for a girl

209
00:12:58,294 --> 00:12:59,730
Is that true?

210
00:13:00,887 --> 00:13:02,762
Both of you got a date or what?

211
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:03,800
Yeah

212
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,877
With who?

213
00:13:04,956 --> 00:13:06,512
The girl with the yellow fabric

214
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:07,470
You...

215
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,986
That cute one with the yellow fabric

216
00:13:09,106 --> 00:13:10,702
You too?

217
00:13:16,207 --> 00:13:17,324
Is that her?

218
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:17,883
That's her

219
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:18,840
Let's go

220
00:13:21,394 --> 00:13:23,349
Goddamn it; you people are too much

221
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,585
Had our salary reduced...

222
00:13:24,665 --> 00:13:26,181
And still you tease the ladies

223
00:13:26,301 --> 00:13:28,974
You jerk! Dare mess with me? Get them

224
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:43,696
Break it off!

225
00:13:46,728 --> 00:13:47,566
Who the hell are you?

226
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:50,279
I'm a Shaolin monk, San Te

227
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:51,476
Monk San Te?!

228
00:13:51,555 --> 00:13:55,345
That's me

229
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:01,607
Merciful Buddha

230
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:04,178
Great kung fu! You really from Shaolin?

231
00:14:04,197 --> 00:14:05,474
That's right

232
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,948
No wonder you could do that!

233
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:12,416
Why are you fighting here?

234
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:14,171
Is that necessary?

235
00:14:14,491 --> 00:14:15,568
He's great

236
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:16,884
Good timing. Venerable Monk

237
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:21,313
We're the workers from Chiang Tai Mill

238
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:23,387
They are the famous Manchurian technicians

239
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,095
Our boss hired them

240
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:30,768
And we all got a pay cut

241
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:32,204
Beat them up

242
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,754
Why are you so reckless?

243
00:14:50,791 --> 00:14:53,185
If I didn't hold myself back...

244
00:14:53,304 --> 00:14:56,017
You would either be dead or injured

245
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,643
All the workers, please listen

246
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:03,199
Yes...

247
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:07,069
About your pay cut

248
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:09,223
I'll try my best to help you

249
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:10,939
Really?

250
00:15:11,018 --> 00:15:13,173
Thank you...

251
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:14,210
San Te

252
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:16,684
You go back to tell your chief

253
00:15:16,803 --> 00:15:18,798
I'll visit him later

254
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:26,339
Let's go

255
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:32,403
They left

256
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:42,696
Chief! A monk has come from Shaolin

257
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,534
Who is he?

258
00:15:43,653 --> 00:15:44,850
Monk San Te

259
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:48,242
Isn't he the abbot of the 36 chambers?

260
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:49,119
Yes, he is

261
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,314
Don't get nervous

262
00:15:51,393 --> 00:15:52,630
What can he do to us?

263
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,184
Chu Shih Seng asked him to come over here

264
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:57,896
Come here; why?

265
00:15:57,976 --> 00:15:59,851
Perhaps he's here for us

266
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:02,325
Ok, we'll see how tough he is

267
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:04,799
His martial arts is unbeatable, sir

268
00:16:05,477 --> 00:16:06,315
Is he really that good?

269
00:16:06,394 --> 00:16:07,671
Did you fight against him?

270
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,187
We haven't had a chance

271
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:11,940
But he did show off a little

272
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,052
His steps and strength are incredible

273
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:17,645
I don't think we can handle him

274
00:16:18,443 --> 00:16:20,597
So he's coming to help the workers

275
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:21,635
Where is he now?

276
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,550
He's waiting outside for our reply

277
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:25,385
He came to our doorstep

278
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,420
Everyone... don't worry

279
00:16:27,539 --> 00:16:29,614
We don't need to sacrifice our pay

280
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:32,407
We asked a monk to help us

281
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:34,282
Move it...

282
00:16:35,359 --> 00:16:37,873
Are you looking for trouble? Get to work

283
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:39,867
C'mon, get to work...

284
00:16:39,987 --> 00:16:41,982
What're you doing? Ah Chao!
They're coming

285
00:16:42,341 --> 00:16:43,618
Move your fat ass

286
00:16:44,376 --> 00:16:45,812
Please come in

287
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:48,964
You...

288
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,392
Merciful Buddha

289
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,424
This is Monk San Te from Shaolin

290
00:16:56,544 --> 00:16:57,900
He has come here today...

291
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,653
To restore justice

292
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:04,523
Why the hell did ya
have to blather to him...

293
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:06,398
about our factory affairs?

294
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:09,909
Everything is going on so smoothly

295
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,827
Chief Ma

296
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,502
You took part of our pay
for the Manchurians

297
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:13,659
And you still think we are happy

298
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:15,415
Yes, he dares to think that

299
00:17:16,013 --> 00:17:19,085
Please listen to me. Let's discuss it over

300
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:21,280
Chief Ma

301
00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:24,272
It's really unreasonable

302
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,900
I mean, we're all human beings

303
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,974
They don't need to work and they get paid

304
00:17:31,094 --> 00:17:32,850
And though we need to work very hard...

305
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:34,046
we still bear with a pay cut

306
00:17:34,725 --> 00:17:36,839
The government is controlled by Manchuria

307
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:39,153
There's a difference
because they are Manchurian

308
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:41,467
You are relying on
the power of Manchurians

309
00:17:41,547 --> 00:17:42,943
To force us to agree for a pay cut

310
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:44,300
Who said that?

311
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,731
You don't need to work
if the pay is no good

312
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:50,643
You'll beat us up if we don't work

313
00:17:50,763 --> 00:17:51,641
Yes...

314
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,511
Please have mercy, chief Ma

315
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,665
Merciful Buddha

316
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,014
San Te Monk

317
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,208
The Government sent them

318
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:06,123
Please stay away from our business

319
00:18:06,203 --> 00:18:07,400
Don't get involved

320
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:11,868
I can help you if you need a donation

321
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:13,065
How much do you want?

322
00:18:13,863 --> 00:18:15,698
Just give me a number

323
00:18:15,818 --> 00:18:16,656
I...

324
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:18,212
Fifty taels

325
00:18:18,491 --> 00:18:20,566
One, two, three, four, five

326
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:23,877
This is bribery. Let's beat them up

327
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,317
Stop! Don't be afraid

328
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:49,448
Violence isn't a solution to problems

329
00:18:49,568 --> 00:18:52,560
What do you think, Chief Ma?

330
00:18:54,794 --> 00:18:56,470
You don't agree with me

331
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,140
No...

332
00:19:00,818 --> 00:19:02,255
Have mercy

333
00:19:02,614 --> 00:19:06,124
You still can change your mind. Sir

334
00:19:06,204 --> 00:19:08,997
Give them their old wages

335
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,987
OK

336
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,854
I'll listen to you. San Te Monk

337
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:21,602
Merciful Buddha! You're a good man

338
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:22,200
Yes

339
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,073
Please listen carefully

340
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,746
You'll get the same pay as before

341
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:29,381
All of you can go back to work

342
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,815
That's great

343
00:19:35,645 --> 00:19:37,401
Thank you for your help

344
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:37,999
You...

345
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,515
Please

346
00:19:50,965 --> 00:19:53,040
Shih Seng Ge, using Jen Chiehs skill

347
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,636
Plus our great ideas

348
00:19:54,755 --> 00:19:56,551
Those goddamn Manchurians

349
00:19:56,631 --> 00:19:58,266
They couldn't believe it

350
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:01,777
But they believe it now

351
00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:03,971
Honestly, I can pretend to be anyone

352
00:20:04,051 --> 00:20:06,644
I'm very skillful

353
00:20:06,764 --> 00:20:08,639
I can even feign to be a girl

354
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:14,424
I'm so eighteen and never had a boyfriend

355
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:18,534
Let's drink... cheers...

356
00:20:18,653 --> 00:20:20,648
Don't be too confident, Ah Chieh

357
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:22,842
We were lucky to fool them this time

358
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,156
What if you can't fool them next time,
you'll...

359
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:33,335
Look at me! Lt'll always work

360
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:34,811
What are you doing now?

361
00:20:34,931 --> 00:20:36,487
No more pay cut, Shih Sheng

362
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:37,843
We can finally relax

363
00:20:37,963 --> 00:20:39,280
Come on... Let's have a drink

364
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:40,875
Go ahead! Let's drink...

365
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:59,004
The monk should've stayed in Shaolin

366
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:01,079
Why did he come to Canton?

367
00:21:01,199 --> 00:21:04,151
I saw him in Chiang Tai Dyeing Mill

368
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:05,827
His martial arts are unbeatable

369
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:11,532
All of you are afraid of him. So...

370
00:21:11,652 --> 00:21:13,686
I just wanted to calm things down

371
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:15,841
I agreed to give them
their old pay for a while

372
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,918
Idiot

373
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:21,306
There are many great fighters in Shaolin

374
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:23,102
Had I offended him...

375
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:26,493
All of the workers will be against us

376
00:21:26,613 --> 00:21:28,568
Of course with your contacts...

377
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,483
There shouldn't be a problem

378
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:34,829
Shaolin Temple
should keep to its own matters

379
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:37,382
Let's wait a while.
After the monk leaves...

380
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,337
we'll reduce their pay again

381
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:43,125
Fine then. You can leave

382
00:21:43,245 --> 00:21:43,763
Yes

383
00:21:43,883 --> 00:21:44,920
Let's go...

384
00:21:44,998 --> 00:21:49,586
Hold on! Did you fight against him?

385
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:50,663
No

386
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:55,092
So he just showed off a little

387
00:21:55,212 --> 00:21:57,246
But he is really tough

388
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:58,603
OK...

389
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:03,749
Please ask San Te Monk to come over here

390
00:22:05,345 --> 00:22:06,662
I want to see how much he can do

391
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:07,579
Of course

392
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,817
Keep steady

393
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:22,078
Master...

394
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:44,355
San Te monk is here, Mr. Wong

395
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:52,831
You are...

396
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,825
I'm the monk San Te

397
00:22:55,184 --> 00:22:56,142
You are from...

398
00:22:56,262 --> 00:22:58,057
I'm from Shaolin Temple

399
00:22:58,935 --> 00:23:01,249
And why, may I ask are you here?

400
00:23:01,368 --> 00:23:04,440
For donations or to help people

401
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,196
Both

402
00:23:07,074 --> 00:23:09,627
It looks like you missed one reason

403
00:23:11,422 --> 00:23:14,534
I don't think so

404
00:23:15,212 --> 00:23:19,840
Well, to promote Shaolin martial arts

405
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:22,451
Oh, I practice some time

406
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,563
I really would like to see that

407
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:28,395
I hope you can show me some moves

408
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:29,433
That's no problem

409
00:23:29,512 --> 00:23:30,430
Ah Chao

410
00:23:31,986 --> 00:23:36,295
Please let me have the honor, Master

411
00:23:36,734 --> 00:23:37,531
I...

412
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:38,848
Please

413
00:23:49,738 --> 00:23:53,169
This rock is too big;
might hurt the workers

414
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:58,595
Wonderful... it's a very unusual step

415
00:23:58,714 --> 00:24:00,550
Your eyesight is great

416
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:05,257
You can see the pebble from so far away

417
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:07,771
This is from outside

418
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:11,880
Your inner strength
should be even stronger

419
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,276
Would you show us?

420
00:24:13,394 --> 00:24:16,067
Please grant us the honor. Master

421
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:19,338
All right. I'm going to show you something

422
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:19,954
Come on. We are waiting

423
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:30,925
I don't want you to hit those workers

424
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:32,840
You can fight with us

425
00:24:34,476 --> 00:24:36,152
But I'm afraid I'll hurt you

426
00:24:36,271 --> 00:24:38,386
We want to see your great skill

427
00:24:38,505 --> 00:24:39,942
We're willing to take the chance

428
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:46,365
Go ahead

429
00:24:46,844 --> 00:24:49,477
Monks don't encourage fighting, Mr. Wong

430
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:51,033
If martial arts is
what you'd like to see...

431
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:53,626
You can come to Shaolin Temple

432
00:24:53,746 --> 00:24:56,738
That'll be all. I have to go

433
00:24:58,653 --> 00:25:01,406
Please don't leave. Monk San Te

434
00:25:01,486 --> 00:25:03,401
You came down from the top

435
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,635
Can you go up the same way?

436
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,627
I think walking the stairs will be faster

437
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:10,582
You...

438
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,846
Ah Chieh, you...

439
00:25:18,402 --> 00:25:20,476
Did everyone see it?

440
00:25:20,596 --> 00:25:21,633
You've seen it already

441
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:22,750
San Te

442
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:24,466
You don't need to send me out

443
00:25:27,618 --> 00:25:28,575
Don't move

444
00:25:28,655 --> 00:25:31,607
Chief Ma, please don't push me to fight

445
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:33,602
That's what I want you to do

446
00:25:33,722 --> 00:25:35,477
We can talk about it

447
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:39,108
This pole is not suitable for me

448
00:25:40,424 --> 00:25:42,619
You can use your internal strength

449
00:25:46,209 --> 00:25:48,444
Show me the best of Shaolin

450
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:54,029
What is this?

451
00:25:55,944 --> 00:25:57,021
Damn it

452
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:05,559
You asked a monk to help you

453
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,275
He is a bloody looser

454
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:14,097
Where is your unbeatable skill? Monk

455
00:26:14,217 --> 00:26:15,174
I...

456
00:26:15,852 --> 00:26:18,525
It's your fault. Stupid bald guy

457
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:20,520
Let's go

458
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:25,547
What should we do with him?

459
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:28,539
He dared to fool you

460
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:30,734
You can use real Kung Fu to deal with him

461
00:26:40,546 --> 00:26:41,902
You're still playing around

462
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:44,016
Chief, Chuan Ge

463
00:26:44,415 --> 00:26:46,690
I don't think he can stand it anymore

464
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:50,320
Please let him go. We'll apologize to you

465
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,637
Apologize

466
00:26:51,756 --> 00:26:52,993
All of us will do it...

467
00:26:53,073 --> 00:26:56,664
No, it's no use

468
00:26:56,903 --> 00:26:58,539
Brother Chuan, we beg of you

469
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,855
Please release him

470
00:26:59,935 --> 00:27:01,411
I beat up the people who cheated me

471
00:27:11,345 --> 00:27:12,941
My goodness

472
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:15,734
Please help

473
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,017
Go ahead! Everyone

474
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:59,633
Let's go...

475
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:14,386
Damn it! Beat him

476
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:31,861
Look... he is really in bad shape

477
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:32,858
Uncle Li, what did they do?

478
00:28:32,938 --> 00:28:34,175
Don't be noisy...

479
00:28:35,332 --> 00:28:37,247
How is your wound?

480
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:43,231
They blew San Te's cover

481
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,144
I told you before. You can fool them once

482
00:28:46,263 --> 00:28:48,138
You can't make it twice

483
00:28:48,218 --> 00:28:50,971
All of our workers were beaten

484
00:28:51,051 --> 00:28:53,524
We are going to lose ourjobs

485
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:55,160
Big brother

486
00:28:56,916 --> 00:28:59,269
So dear monk, what're you going to do?

487
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:03,100
God! What was I thinking...

488
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:05,932
And caused so much trouble for everyone

489
00:29:06,052 --> 00:29:07,209
Shut up

490
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,520
Why don't you try to make a living?

491
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,435
Get some honest work

492
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:14,829
Don't always opt for the easy way out

493
00:29:14,949 --> 00:29:18,779
Just like you, Big brother?

494
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:22,010
Look at you! You're punch bags

495
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,165
You deserve it because you cheated others

496
00:29:24,284 --> 00:29:25,641
But not only did you get punished...

497
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:27,237
All the workers suffered too

498
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:31,386
That's true. I shouldn't involve everyone

499
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:35,934
But I made it the first time

500
00:29:36,014 --> 00:29:37,610
No one got a pay cut

501
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:39,525
It would be fine if we stop then

502
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:41,958
I shouldn't have continued the act

503
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:43,634
Do you really think I know Kung Fu?

504
00:29:43,754 --> 00:29:44,671
I can't do anything

505
00:29:44,751 --> 00:29:46,666
You ought to learn some useful skill

506
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:50,935
All right, I will

507
00:29:51,334 --> 00:29:54,167
Don't expect my help when I succeed

508
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,757
Ah Chieh

509
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,306
Chou Jen Chieh

510
00:30:13,131 --> 00:30:14,567
This time...

511
00:30:16,722 --> 00:30:20,592
Who do you want me to be?

512
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:24,781
Monastery of Wu Dong or Bai Mei

513
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,294
You want me to be a governor
or an officer?

514
00:30:27,813 --> 00:30:33,757
Tell me. Who do you want me to be?

515
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:39,261
Aren't I good?

516
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:40,418
Yes

517
00:30:40,535 --> 00:30:41,931
Look at you

518
00:30:45,682 --> 00:30:48,474
Are you pretending you got beaten up?

519
00:30:48,594 --> 00:30:51,866
Ah Chao was beaten up

520
00:30:52,344 --> 00:30:57,491
Ah Chao's injuries are real

521
00:30:57,571 --> 00:31:00,683
I always try to fool others

522
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:04,832
Why did I do it?

523
00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:06,228
You don't need to lie

524
00:31:07,585 --> 00:31:09,335
How can I compete with others
without lying?

525
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:10,452
With real Kung Fu

526
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:12,447
You're still pulling my leg

527
00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:14,003
You know that I can't do Kung Fu

528
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:14,920
You can learn it

529
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,357
Where can I go to learn it?

530
00:31:16,676 --> 00:31:17,753
You can go to Shaolin Temple

531
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:22,740
Shaolin. Why don't you go?

532
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,496
All of us were injured

533
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:27,687
Will they take sissies like us?

534
00:31:28,445 --> 00:31:31,597
You think Shaolin is that easy to enter?

535
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:34,829
Not for others; but you can, Ah Chieh

536
00:31:35,547 --> 00:31:36,523
Why me?

537
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:38,177
You can pretend to be a monk

538
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:39,255
That's right

539
00:31:39,334 --> 00:31:40,611
You askin' me to do it again?

540
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,888
Ah Chieh

541
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,883
You'd rather see us suffer, Jen Chieh

542
00:31:43,962 --> 00:31:45,319
And let them bully us forever

543
00:31:45,438 --> 00:31:47,353
Yes, after you learn kung fu...

544
00:31:47,473 --> 00:31:49,149
We won't need to lie

545
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:52,549
All right.
Say, even if I can get in Shaolin,

546
00:31:52,569 --> 00:31:54,045
it'd still require many years to learn

547
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,960
That's all right. No matter what

548
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,194
We'll wait for you to avenge us

549
00:31:58,274 --> 00:32:01,545
I'll learn not only for revenge

550
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:03,341
But also so that I can teach you

551
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,857
Then we'll be able to protect ourselves

552
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:06,772
Yes. Merciful Buddha

553
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:07,530
OK

554
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:09,963
Don't get close. I'm really a monk

555
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,559
I can't get near women folk

556
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,716
But not me

557
00:32:13,873 --> 00:32:15,070
Don't hit me

558
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,387
What the hell are you talking about?

559
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,748
Go collect the grain. Don't stand here

560
00:32:47,825 --> 00:32:49,620
Collect the grain?

561
00:32:51,216 --> 00:32:52,772
Take it over

562
00:33:10,486 --> 00:33:11,723
Stop hitting me...

563
00:33:11,843 --> 00:33:13,558
There is someone here. Cut it out

564
00:33:15,112 --> 00:33:16,628
I'm not a barrel. Stop it

565
00:33:16,748 --> 00:33:18,344
Oh come off it, please

566
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:20,857
What are you doing?

567
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:24,527
I'll make you carry 50 bags of grain each

568
00:33:32,985 --> 00:33:34,422
Master...

569
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,294
Master?

570
00:33:40,446 --> 00:33:46,351
How do you teach these little monks?

571
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,183
It's because I'm not capable

572
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:53,492
You can all rest today

573
00:33:53,612 --> 00:33:55,447
Please take me to Shaolin Temple first

574
00:33:55,527 --> 00:33:56,604
As you wish

575
00:33:59,477 --> 00:33:59,915
Old monk

576
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:01,870
How can you treat a master so rudely?

577
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,623
Stop lying!

578
00:34:04,703 --> 00:34:06,498
I'll hang you on the big tree over there

579
00:34:06,618 --> 00:34:08,533
If you dare pretend to be a monk again

580
00:34:08,653 --> 00:34:09,890
Hurry up! Go now!

581
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:16,071
Continue collecting the grain

582
00:34:16,151 --> 00:34:17,308
Move faster...

583
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:33,484
Shaolin Monks
are carrying vegetables back

584
00:34:44,137 --> 00:34:46,012
Master. This is not easy to digest

585
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:47,089
I know

586
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:48,007
Master, you...

587
00:34:53,073 --> 00:34:53,951
I was a monk since I was little

588
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:55,746
I was scared of the scarring pain...

589
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:58,140
So I moved

590
00:34:59,217 --> 00:35:00,215
No wonder!

591
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:13,618
Please have some tea

592
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:16,610
Drink some tea

593
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:21,398
Why don't they drink some tea?

594
00:35:23,911 --> 00:35:25,148
Please drink tea

595
00:35:27,598 --> 00:35:28,994
Go ahead

596
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:43,756
Good man

597
00:35:48,623 --> 00:35:49,900
You want another one

598
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:00,829
Such a waste

599
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:15,590
It hasn't taken effect

600
00:36:21,575 --> 00:36:22,692
Go ahead! It's about time

601
00:36:28,995 --> 00:36:31,150
This monk can really hold it

602
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:46,989
Better find a place to take a dump

603
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:07,017
This way

604
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:12,562
Hurry up...

605
00:37:24,185 --> 00:37:25,582
I don't need any help

606
00:37:27,457 --> 00:37:29,731
Where are you going?

607
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:31,885
Shaolin Temple

608
00:37:31,965 --> 00:37:33,362
Which Temple?

609
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,316
Shaolin Temple

610
00:37:35,396 --> 00:37:38,588
Which one of the 36 chambers?

611
00:37:39,186 --> 00:37:40,663
The kitchen chamber, of course

612
00:37:40,742 --> 00:37:41,820
The kitchen?

613
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,655
Get out

614
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,645
Hey little one, did you find out anything?

615
00:38:02,765 --> 00:38:03,603
Certainly

616
00:38:03,683 --> 00:38:05,877
Found out every tiny detail. Let's go

617
00:38:06,236 --> 00:38:08,231
Come back! Stop...

618
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:09,228
What is your problem?

619
00:38:09,348 --> 00:38:10,944
Is this for real?

620
00:38:12,141 --> 00:38:13,338
I have done my homework

621
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,534
To go to Shaolin Temple

622
00:38:14,654 --> 00:38:15,851
You got to have a lot of courage

623
00:38:15,971 --> 00:38:17,646
Did he ask for all of us?

624
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:27,261
There is the rule San Te Monk sets

625
00:38:27,341 --> 00:38:29,336
After one year, the freshers...

626
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:30,772
Can go home for a while

627
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:31,770
Why is that?

628
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:32,488
For no apparent reason

629
00:38:32,607 --> 00:38:33,964
He needs to ensure your willpower

630
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:35,480
To see if the person has consistency
and endurance

631
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,517
What will happen otherwise?

632
00:38:36,597 --> 00:38:37,993
You can't go back anymore

633
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:39,071
And if one comes through all the tests?

634
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,228
He will let them know

635
00:38:40,347 --> 00:38:42,422
He'll tell them which day to return

636
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:43,619
Which day of which month?

637
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,095
The next day

638
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:46,372
Really the next day

639
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:48,127
Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve

640
00:38:48,247 --> 00:38:49,484
One dozen. Thank you

641
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:54,048
Excuse me! I didn't see you

642
00:39:57,842 --> 00:40:00,076
It's very difficult to make it, Ah Te

643
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:01,712
Yes, I found the solution

644
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,906
Just line up with all those monks

645
00:40:15,631 --> 00:40:17,147
Please help me

646
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:27,001
Thank you. Please help me out...

647
00:40:33,704 --> 00:40:35,220
Let me go...

648
00:40:36,057 --> 00:40:38,451
Please help me

649
00:40:38,531 --> 00:40:42,521
Don't go! Please help me

650
00:40:43,957 --> 00:40:51,378
Do me a favor...

651
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,362
You can get in and out as you wish

652
00:40:57,482 --> 00:40:58,998
lt'd be better if you leave now

653
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,945
Get out. Hurry up...

654
00:41:35,277 --> 00:41:37,551
They walked over the sand

655
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:39,067
They didn't leave any footprints

656
00:41:40,304 --> 00:41:42,777
Their skill is incredible

657
00:41:46,607 --> 00:41:48,802
Wonderful...

658
00:41:48,921 --> 00:41:50,597
That special Kung Fu of yours

659
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:54,507
You can walk on the sand
without footprints

660
00:41:54,627 --> 00:41:59,215
It's just amazing. Merciful Buddha

661
00:41:59,294 --> 00:42:01,608
Merciful Buddha

662
00:42:01,888 --> 00:42:06,197
Which chamber do you belong to?

663
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:08,949
I'm from North Shaolin

664
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:11,423
I've come to learn

665
00:42:11,503 --> 00:42:15,173
You're too kind... we're the same

666
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:18,604
What would you like to see?

667
00:42:18,724 --> 00:42:20,041
Kung Fu

668
00:42:23,432 --> 00:42:26,304
We have the same kind of sand pond

669
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:28,379
But our method is different

670
00:42:28,499 --> 00:42:29,496
Can you tell us the difference?

671
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:32,528
We're walking very close together

672
00:42:32,648 --> 00:42:34,124
Do you mean right next to each other?

673
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:37,276
Do you want me to show you?

674
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:38,552
Please do

675
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:41,664
Go

676
00:42:50,043 --> 00:42:51,559
Why're you tugging at my clothes?

677
00:42:51,678 --> 00:42:53,474
This is called "Tumbling attachment"

678
00:42:53,593 --> 00:42:54,591
I beg your pardon?

679
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,865
I haven't heard that before

680
00:42:57,383 --> 00:42:58,820
You wouldn't understand it. Move

681
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,847
What is this called?

682
00:43:03,926 --> 00:43:05,961
This is "Priest San Chang
crossing the river"

683
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:08,036
What does it mean?

684
00:43:08,116 --> 00:43:09,672
The Priest,
when he was crossing the river...

685
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:12,863
His second apprentice was piggy backing him

686
00:43:12,943 --> 00:43:14,698
Who was his second apprentice?

687
00:43:14,778 --> 00:43:15,736
The General Pig

688
00:43:15,855 --> 00:43:17,172
Are you saying I'm a pig?

689
00:43:24,673 --> 00:43:26,468
Merciful Buddha

690
00:43:26,548 --> 00:43:27,745
Your Kung Fu is incredible

691
00:43:27,864 --> 00:43:31,335
I could hardly follow it

692
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,846
Thank you. What're they practicing inside?

693
00:43:34,966 --> 00:43:36,482
You'll find out if you come in

694
00:43:40,072 --> 00:43:41,509
Abbot, he...

695
00:44:17,131 --> 00:44:18,527
Why can't it open?

696
00:44:18,647 --> 00:44:20,203
Punch it...

697
00:44:20,562 --> 00:44:24,193
Are you crazy?

698
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:27,025
It's broken. Forget about it

699
00:44:38,396 --> 00:44:39,832
This door is fine

700
00:44:39,952 --> 00:44:42,226
It's not broken

701
00:44:43,941 --> 00:44:45,218
Stop giggling

702
00:44:45,856 --> 00:44:46,614
You're from the North...

703
00:44:46,694 --> 00:44:47,971
Yes, I am

704
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:50,684
Are there any laymen in North Shaolin?

705
00:44:51,442 --> 00:44:55,830
Not until of late

706
00:44:56,668 --> 00:45:00,059
You have passed the test

707
00:45:00,139 --> 00:45:02,413
I'll take you as my apprentice

708
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,408
Thank you, Abbot

709
00:45:04,687 --> 00:45:07,719
Not yet.
You need enter 36th chamber's gate

710
00:45:08,517 --> 00:45:10,791
The 36th chamber!

711
00:45:57,406 --> 00:45:58,683
You first

712
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:19,848
Merciful Buddha

713
00:47:19,968 --> 00:47:22,362
Merciful Buddha. Your good name, Abbot?

714
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:24,157
I'm San Te

715
00:47:24,237 --> 00:47:25,274
San Te?

716
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:29,583
What brings you here, Sir?

717
00:47:29,702 --> 00:47:32,336
I... um, I've come for you

718
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:34,171
Is there anything I can do for you?

719
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:35,607
Hope that you will take me in

720
00:47:36,644 --> 00:47:40,794
I would like to be your pupil

721
00:47:40,913 --> 00:47:42,230
Where are you from?

722
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:43,866
I'm from North Shaolin Temple

723
00:47:43,985 --> 00:47:46,219
Do they also have freshmen there?

724
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:48,693
I lived in the village below North Shaolin

725
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:51,406
How did you get into our chamber?

726
00:47:51,486 --> 00:47:55,037
I fought my way through

727
00:47:55,116 --> 00:47:56,872
And I came in through the Iron Gate

728
00:47:56,905 --> 00:47:58,740
What's wrong with your head?

729
00:48:00,214 --> 00:48:02,448
I... you see, I've got gray hair

730
00:48:02,528 --> 00:48:05,081
I'm still young so I dyed it black

731
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:07,634
All right. You want to be my apprentice

732
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:09,789
You'll have to wash your head first

733
00:48:09,909 --> 00:48:10,906
Thank you, Abbot

734
00:48:38,674 --> 00:48:41,028
Abbot San Te

735
00:48:41,147 --> 00:48:44,538
Can I wash my head here?

736
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:49,366
I'm going right now

737
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:54,513
Let me go... I need to wash my head

738
00:48:57,744 --> 00:48:59,819
They... won't let me

739
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:02,891
This water is for washing clothes

740
00:49:03,968 --> 00:49:05,684
Then...

741
00:49:11,269 --> 00:49:12,905
Up here?

742
00:49:24,116 --> 00:49:26,589
We've to keep the water clean.
Take it down

743
00:49:26,669 --> 00:49:27,786
Yes

744
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:34,249
Take the water down and wash there

745
00:50:04,531 --> 00:50:06,725
Up...

746
00:50:24,995 --> 00:50:26,551
All the water is spilt

747
00:50:28,027 --> 00:50:29,184
Stop it. Everyone

748
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:32,270
Leave Chin-Long well for him

749
00:50:32,350 --> 00:50:34,504
It's for him to use only

750
00:50:34,584 --> 00:50:37,855
You can use another well for water

751
00:50:37,975 --> 00:50:39,052
Yes

752
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:46,313
San Te really treats me nice

753
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:51,221
Does he suspect me? I don't think so...

754
00:50:53,574 --> 00:50:55,250
Can I borrow a bucket? Please

755
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:57,644
Please lend me this bucket

756
00:50:59,639 --> 00:51:02,631
I can't get water without a bucket

757
00:51:02,751 --> 00:51:03,908
How can I wash my head without water?

758
00:51:11,209 --> 00:51:12,645
Isn't this water?

759
00:51:15,398 --> 00:51:18,071
How can you use a rock to get the water?

760
00:51:46,796 --> 00:51:48,551
There is only a rock

761
00:51:48,831 --> 00:51:51,703
There'd be nothing left if I throw it

762
00:53:32,654 --> 00:53:35,128
Luckily there is no one here

763
00:53:40,514 --> 00:53:43,307
Why is there no water in the evening?

764
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:50,727
There is no bucket. What should I do?

765
00:53:54,757 --> 00:53:57,151
I can take it off to wash

766
00:54:21,328 --> 00:54:24,599
That wouldn't be so appropriate

767
00:54:27,312 --> 00:54:28,589
Show your face

768
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:42,233
To fling a letter stuck on knife
is an old trick

769
00:55:00,905 --> 00:55:05,493
The less you think about,
the better you hit

770
00:55:05,613 --> 00:55:06,969
San Te

771
00:55:10,241 --> 00:55:13,392
San Te Abbot. My mind isn't evil

772
00:55:14,071 --> 00:55:16,544
I'll use the rock...

773
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,400
I'm almost done

774
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:40,913
It's clean now

775
00:57:48,174 --> 00:57:50,129
I didn't remember it's yellow

776
00:57:50,648 --> 00:57:52,004
Why did I bother?

777
00:57:52,603 --> 00:57:54,119
I shouldn't have said I had gray hair

778
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:56,233
It's yellow

779
00:57:57,071 --> 00:57:58,148
What are you doing?

780
00:57:58,906 --> 00:58:01,460
Man, this time I'm doomed!

781
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:13,349
Seems okay

782
00:58:18,073 --> 00:58:20,387
Abbot San Te

783
00:58:21,863 --> 00:58:23,538
I've cleaned my hair

784
00:58:23,618 --> 00:58:27,528
Abbot San Te... l've done it

785
00:58:27,608 --> 00:58:28,805
Come and have a look

786
00:58:29,323 --> 00:58:33,672
Abbot San Te... l've washed my hair

787
00:58:33,792 --> 00:58:35,188
Would you come to see it?

788
00:58:35,268 --> 00:58:38,260
I've cleaned my hair very well

789
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:41,691
You really have gray hair!

790
00:58:41,811 --> 00:58:42,729
Really

791
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:46,599
Abbot

792
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:50,070
Please don't touch it

793
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,256
I really have gray hair

794
00:59:01,041 --> 00:59:02,118
Abbot

795
00:59:03,914 --> 00:59:04,911
Abbot

796
00:59:05,549 --> 00:59:06,906
Please forgive me

797
00:59:07,025 --> 00:59:09,499
It's very difficult
to get water with a rock

798
00:59:12,707 --> 00:59:16,178
I will not try it again

799
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:20,287
Merciful Buddha

800
00:59:21,245 --> 00:59:22,402
Chou Jen Chieh

801
00:59:22,481 --> 00:59:24,676
You sneaked into Shaolin Temple

802
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:26,990
I knew it from the start

803
00:59:28,242 --> 00:59:29,719
Did you?

804
00:59:35,264 --> 00:59:36,421
Then it's time to go, I guess

805
00:59:39,573 --> 00:59:40,610
Wait a second!

806
00:59:42,286 --> 00:59:43,603
I thought you wanted me out

807
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:46,994
No. You can stay

808
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:49,188
Thank you, Master

809
00:59:49,587 --> 00:59:51,462
You're not going to be my pupil

810
00:59:51,542 --> 00:59:53,856
You've been living here for a long time

811
00:59:53,936 --> 00:59:56,130
You should help Shaolin in return

812
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,125
All right. I'll try my best

813
00:59:59,521 --> 01:00:01,676
We renovate the temple every 10 years

814
01:00:01,755 --> 01:00:04,189
You're in charge of scaffolding

815
01:00:04,197 --> 01:00:06,152
Do you mean all by myself?

816
01:00:06,272 --> 01:00:07,708
That's right

817
01:00:07,788 --> 01:00:10,142
You'll scaffold every single building

818
01:00:10,221 --> 01:00:12,096
You can do it alone

819
01:00:13,253 --> 01:00:17,283
It's a very big temple. Abbot

820
01:00:17,403 --> 01:00:18,999
When will I finish it?

821
01:00:19,078 --> 01:00:21,193
What is your answer anyway?

822
01:00:21,273 --> 01:00:22,150
There's no way I can accomplish it

823
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:23,108
Absolutely not

824
01:00:23,228 --> 01:00:24,943
All right. I'll do it

825
01:03:19,075 --> 01:03:20,790
Good evening, Master

826
01:05:31,685 --> 01:05:33,441
Don't stop! Go on!

827
01:05:36,353 --> 01:05:37,789
Chou Jen Chieh

828
01:05:40,303 --> 01:05:41,540
Abbot

829
01:05:41,659 --> 01:05:44,133
I told you
unless you're done with the task,

830
01:05:44,253 --> 01:05:46,287
You're not allowed in the chamber

831
01:05:46,407 --> 01:05:48,641
I didn't touch the ground. Abbot

832
01:05:48,721 --> 01:05:49,878
Yeah, that I can see too

833
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:51,155
I'm standing on the pole

834
01:05:51,274 --> 01:05:53,269
I wasn't in the chamber

835
01:05:54,346 --> 01:05:56,142
Are you doing this on purpose?

836
01:05:56,221 --> 01:05:57,538
No. I'm not messing around

837
01:05:57,658 --> 01:05:58,695
I didn't interrupt them

838
01:05:58,815 --> 01:06:00,131
They can continue

839
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:01,129
Go on! Hurry up!

840
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:03,602
Work hard! Keep on going!

841
01:06:03,722 --> 01:06:05,677
Move it! Don't stop!

842
01:06:06,954 --> 01:06:09,786
Please no more... Abbot

843
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:13,297
I'll fall down if you don't stop

844
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,397
Go do your work

845
01:07:57,171 --> 01:08:01,161
I've finished it, Abbot San Te

846
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,994
You may come to check it out

847
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:05,829
I've done my job

848
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:07,784
The whole thing

849
01:08:07,903 --> 01:08:09,699
Yes, I did it all

850
01:08:12,427 --> 01:08:13,824
You've scaffolding at every chamber

851
01:08:13,943 --> 01:08:15,619
Did you know how long it took?

852
01:08:18,731 --> 01:08:20,686
It took a little over than a year

853
01:08:20,766 --> 01:08:23,279
Why did you need such a long time?

854
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:24,995
I was working hard. Abbot

855
01:08:25,114 --> 01:08:26,551
I climbed up and down

856
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:28,426
From left to right

857
01:08:28,545 --> 01:08:30,221
Day and night

858
01:08:30,341 --> 01:08:32,734
Sunrise to Sunset

859
01:08:33,772 --> 01:08:34,969
Are you sure?

860
01:08:35,328 --> 01:08:38,599
Well, sometimes I did watch them practice

861
01:08:39,836 --> 01:08:42,310
But please believe me.
I didn't waste time

862
01:08:46,895 --> 01:08:48,849
It's very durable, Abbot San Te

863
01:08:48,969 --> 01:08:51,602
Abbot San Te...

864
01:08:57,986 --> 01:08:59,701
It's very strong

865
01:09:00,978 --> 01:09:02,893
I can tell it's very strong

866
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:05,167
I want you to tear it down now

867
01:09:05,646 --> 01:09:07,920
I beg your pardon? Tear it down!

868
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:10,114
Yes, you can leave after you finish

869
01:09:10,234 --> 01:09:11,351
You will be free to go

870
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:13,266
I have to go after I take it down!

871
01:09:15,181 --> 01:09:17,296
Is that some kind of a prank, Master?

872
01:09:17,375 --> 01:09:18,532
How can you treat others like that?

873
01:09:18,812 --> 01:09:20,527
I thought you'd take me
as your apprentice,

874
01:09:20,607 --> 01:09:21,684
After I finished my task

875
01:09:21,804 --> 01:09:23,320
Now you ask me to tear it down

876
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:25,155
Isn't that like making fun of me?

877
01:09:25,275 --> 01:09:27,389
You dare talk back to a Shaolin Abbot?

878
01:09:27,509 --> 01:09:28,746
Don't you know you can be punished?

879
01:09:28,826 --> 01:09:30,142
The worse is you'd send me to the Heaven

880
01:09:30,222 --> 01:09:30,980
You...

881
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:31,698
What did you want to say?

882
01:09:31,818 --> 01:09:33,254
I thought Shaolin Monks were reasonable

883
01:09:33,374 --> 01:09:34,251
How come you aren't?

884
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:35,688
Shut up. Get out right now

885
01:09:35,807 --> 01:09:37,323
I'm not leaving just because you say so

886
01:09:49,891 --> 01:09:51,686
You're really a cunning monk

887
01:09:56,431 --> 01:09:58,306
At the most I'll need to tie it back again

888
01:10:07,163 --> 01:10:08,320
But I will not leave now

889
01:10:09,557 --> 01:10:10,674
There is no way you're sending me away

890
01:10:10,993 --> 01:10:12,350
I'm going to stay in Shaolin

891
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:13,746
I want to learn martial arts

892
01:10:14,863 --> 01:10:16,060
Starting from the beginning

893
01:10:23,281 --> 01:10:24,997
So you won't leave, is it?

894
01:10:25,117 --> 01:10:26,154
Nope

895
01:10:40,796 --> 01:10:41,993
You can't make me leave

896
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:51,448
Never

897
01:10:56,435 --> 01:11:02,819
What happened? I'll tie it up

898
01:11:05,013 --> 01:11:06,609
What's wrong with you?
Are you pushing me?

899
01:11:06,728 --> 01:11:09,042
I'm going to learn Kung Fu
and I ain't leaving

900
01:11:36,606 --> 01:11:40,117
Abbot San Te. Abbot San Te

901
01:11:40,636 --> 01:11:44,107
Abbot San Te...

902
01:11:52,644 --> 01:11:55,238
I...

903
01:11:58,110 --> 01:11:59,307
- San...
- Go!

904
01:12:02,539 --> 01:12:04,015
Do you want to try the Woodmen Lane?

905
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:06,887
It's a huge incense burner

906
01:12:06,967 --> 01:12:08,084
Get out!

907
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:19,973
Please take care! Abbot

908
01:12:28,631 --> 01:12:29,987
How is business?

909
01:12:30,067 --> 01:12:31,423
Not too bad

910
01:12:33,458 --> 01:12:34,496
What's wrong?

911
01:12:34,615 --> 01:12:36,371
There is someone here

912
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:37,328
You're just pouring it down

913
01:12:58,633 --> 01:13:00,987
Look at your palm. You're a lucky person

914
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:05,535
Lots of people will help you

915
01:13:10,602 --> 01:13:11,958
Please buy some

916
01:13:12,038 --> 01:13:13,514
Give a little...

917
01:13:15,389 --> 01:13:20,217
Come on... it smells good.

918
01:13:21,613 --> 01:13:22,770
I've got peanuts here

919
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:25,244
Give me some...

920
01:13:41,801 --> 01:13:43,277
Don't go! Ah Chao

921
01:13:43,356 --> 01:13:45,670
Come on. What's just a few peanuts?

922
01:13:46,149 --> 01:13:48,304
Hmm, it ain't stealing

923
01:13:48,423 --> 01:13:51,296
Stealing? Ah Chao

924
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,692
I'll help you
when you're loading the goods

925
01:13:52,812 --> 01:13:54,926
We can off-load a little more

926
01:13:55,924 --> 01:13:56,921
All of you have been changing your career

927
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:58,677
Not really. We're still coolies

928
01:13:58,756 --> 01:14:00,991
Sometimes there is stuff

929
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:03,105
We will happen to be there...

930
01:14:03,225 --> 01:14:04,501
What are you talking about?

931
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:11,603
You're back. Chou Jen Chieh

932
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,151
How are you? Ah Chieh, you're back!

933
01:14:16,231 --> 01:14:21,697
Hey, it's Ah Chieh...

934
01:14:21,816 --> 01:14:23,492
Come on! Everyone

935
01:14:23,612 --> 01:14:25,806
Chou Jen Chieh is back

936
01:14:25,926 --> 01:14:26,484
Ah Chieh

937
01:14:26,604 --> 01:14:30,793
Did you learn a lot of martial arts?

938
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:35,876
Ah Chieh

939
01:14:42,938 --> 01:14:44,454
Mr. Li, Hsiao Tsing

940
01:14:44,573 --> 01:14:46,129
Hsiao Li, Mr. Chang

941
01:14:46,209 --> 01:14:46,808
Hsiao Hung

942
01:14:46,927 --> 01:14:47,366
Ah Chieh

943
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:48,204
You've changed to a new job

944
01:14:48,324 --> 01:14:50,039
Yeah

945
01:14:51,436 --> 01:14:52,273
Where is my brother?

946
01:14:52,393 --> 01:14:53,829
He's still at home

947
01:14:55,385 --> 01:14:56,861
Why is he at home?

948
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:09,150
It's my fault. I screwed up

949
01:15:09,269 --> 01:15:11,065
Caused you to lose yourjobs

950
01:15:15,852 --> 01:15:17,647
How is business?

951
01:15:17,727 --> 01:15:20,241
We depend on the customers

952
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,555
They are mostly from the Dyeing Mill

953
01:15:22,674 --> 01:15:24,510
Their pay is getting less and less

954
01:15:24,589 --> 01:15:26,744
They can't afford to buy anything

955
01:15:27,542 --> 01:15:28,539
It's all because of those Manchurians

956
01:15:28,619 --> 01:15:30,135
Well, we don't need to fear them anymore

957
01:15:30,255 --> 01:15:31,571
You've learnt Shaolin Kung Fu

958
01:15:31,691 --> 01:15:32,968
What are you saying?

959
01:15:33,087 --> 01:15:35,361
You've learned Kung Fu in Shaolin Temple

960
01:15:35,481 --> 01:15:36,957
There is no need to be afraid of them

961
01:15:37,077 --> 01:15:39,271
Yes, no more fear

962
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:42,024
I... I didn't learn martial arts

963
01:15:42,702 --> 01:15:44,418
You pretended once before, even though...

964
01:15:44,537 --> 01:15:45,615
you didn't know Kung Fu

965
01:15:45,734 --> 01:15:48,527
Now you've really learnt Kung Fu

966
01:15:48,527 --> 01:15:50,202
I am not lying this once

967
01:15:50,322 --> 01:15:53,075
I couldn't learn martial arts at Shaolin

968
01:15:53,194 --> 01:15:54,910
Why then did you spend
so much time there?

969
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:57,264
Maybe working your eyes? Ears? Or head?

970
01:15:57,384 --> 01:16:00,376
What did you do there?

971
01:16:00,456 --> 01:16:01,972
Did you learn anything?

972
01:16:02,809 --> 01:16:04,724
I was scaffolding

973
01:16:05,084 --> 01:16:06,201
Hey, are you still making fun of us?

974
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,557
Please be serious

975
01:16:07,677 --> 01:16:10,629
Right. Don't kid around

976
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:15,496
I feel bad.
I've been in Shaolin for 3 years

977
01:16:15,816 --> 01:16:17,491
Yet I didn't learn anything...

978
01:16:17,611 --> 01:16:20,085
Except scaffolding

979
01:16:20,204 --> 01:16:22,319
Why did you come back?

980
01:16:22,438 --> 01:16:23,675
If you haven't learned martial arts

981
01:16:23,755 --> 01:16:25,550
Why did you come back?

982
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:27,585
They sent me away

983
01:16:30,056 --> 01:16:33,128
Ah Chao, have you hurt yourself?

984
01:16:36,998 --> 01:16:38,833
Are you all right?

985
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:40,748
What happened?

986
01:16:40,868 --> 01:16:42,663
Ah Chieh threw you over

987
01:16:42,783 --> 01:16:44,738
Yes, he did it

988
01:16:44,858 --> 01:16:46,334
Did he throw me over?

989
01:16:47,491 --> 01:16:50,363
It is Kung Fu. He must've learnt it

990
01:16:50,443 --> 01:16:52,438
That's right! He absolutely has

991
01:16:52,518 --> 01:16:53,675
It's fantastic!

992
01:16:53,794 --> 01:16:55,869
But why did he deny it?

993
01:17:03,449 --> 01:17:05,005
Be good! Don't cry!

994
01:17:09,234 --> 01:17:10,750
Don't cry...

995
01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:11,787
Brother

996
01:17:17,054 --> 01:17:19,208
Brother! I'm back

997
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:23,477
You're back from Shaolin

998
01:17:23,557 --> 01:17:24,355
Yes

999
01:17:24,634 --> 01:17:26,948
Ah Fen, he is back from Shaolin

1000
01:17:27,068 --> 01:17:28,065
It's great

1001
01:17:29,102 --> 01:17:30,180
Ah Chieh

1002
01:17:30,299 --> 01:17:32,254
Brother, your hand...

1003
01:17:32,374 --> 01:17:33,930
No big deal. We were waiting forever

1004
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:35,805
You've learned Kung Fu from Shaolin

1005
01:17:35,925 --> 01:17:37,042
We've been waiting for a long time

1006
01:17:37,162 --> 01:17:39,037
Finally you're back!

1007
01:17:39,156 --> 01:17:41,271
Right. We've been anxiously awaiting...

1008
01:17:41,391 --> 01:17:43,545
For you to bring justice

1009
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:44,502
Dear sister-in-law

1010
01:17:44,622 --> 01:17:45,460
Wong Kao Feng and his staff

1011
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:47,774
They've bullied us for so long

1012
01:17:47,854 --> 01:17:50,287
We must pay it back this time. Ah Fen

1013
01:17:50,407 --> 01:17:52,083
Teach them a lesson

1014
01:17:52,202 --> 01:17:53,200
That's right

1015
01:17:54,756 --> 01:17:58,307
Brother, Sister-in-law

1016
01:17:58,464 --> 01:18:02,254
I didn't learn anything in Shaolin

1017
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:04,927
I haven't learned Kung Fu there

1018
01:18:05,645 --> 01:18:07,041
You're lying

1019
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,398
It's true. I haven't

1020
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:09,196
Well, you just don't want to help us

1021
01:18:09,315 --> 01:18:11,151
And you've learned it. I'll hit you

1022
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,746
I really didn't learn any martial arts

1023
01:18:12,866 --> 01:18:15,220
What are you doing?

1024
01:18:16,936 --> 01:18:18,132
Let go off me. Let me go...

1025
01:18:18,252 --> 01:18:20,087
Please let me go

1026
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:22,601
Did you hear me? Let me go

1027
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,274
You're mistaken. You're pulling me

1028
01:18:27,309 --> 01:18:29,263
Great Kung Fu

1029
01:18:29,383 --> 01:18:30,341
Did I hurt you? Ah Chao

1030
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:31,139
Of course not

1031
01:18:31,218 --> 01:18:33,532
I'd throw up if you were really punching

1032
01:18:34,171 --> 01:18:36,365
What did you say? That's called Kung Fu

1033
01:18:36,485 --> 01:18:38,599
Yes. It is

1034
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:40,235
Please listen carefully

1035
01:18:40,355 --> 01:18:42,828
I'll need to try some more

1036
01:18:43,706 --> 01:18:45,142
You come out towards me

1037
01:18:46,419 --> 01:18:48,015
One by one

1038
01:18:51,246 --> 01:18:52,962
Can you move?

1039
01:19:06,085 --> 01:19:07,641
Your Kung Fu is fantastic

1040
01:19:14,503 --> 01:19:15,421
What's wrong...

1041
01:19:15,541 --> 01:19:20,089
Hurry... not so slow

1042
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:21,006
This is yours

1043
01:19:21,126 --> 01:19:22,881
Move on... Next...

1044
01:19:23,161 --> 01:19:24,956
Is this yours?

1045
01:19:25,036 --> 01:19:26,472
It's only that little. They deducted again

1046
01:19:26,552 --> 01:19:28,786
What can we do? We need to work

1047
01:19:29,345 --> 01:19:30,302
What are you saying?

1048
01:19:30,422 --> 01:19:30,980
Nothing

1049
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:32,975
Go to work! Hurry up!

1050
01:19:39,997 --> 01:19:40,875
Chief

1051
01:19:43,388 --> 01:19:45,622
Move it! Faster

1052
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:55,796
Is this the right color?

1053
01:19:55,876 --> 01:19:56,753
Damn you

1054
01:19:58,429 --> 01:19:59,267
Get away

1055
01:20:00,823 --> 01:20:03,655
Damn it! You're really too much

1056
01:20:04,493 --> 01:20:05,930
What are you doing here? We're not hiring

1057
01:20:06,289 --> 01:20:06,847
We are here for you

1058
01:20:06,967 --> 01:20:08,842
We want to show you something

1059
01:20:09,361 --> 01:20:10,717
It's you!

1060
01:20:10,837 --> 01:20:12,672
Great eyesight

1061
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:15,305
Show me then! Come on in

1062
01:20:15,943 --> 01:20:18,976
Open the door

1063
01:20:19,095 --> 01:20:21,968
You can't even open the door

1064
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:28,008
Get out! Go to work

1065
01:20:41,113 --> 01:20:42,429
Manchurian pole-man

1066
01:20:42,549 --> 01:20:43,586
You...

1067
01:20:43,706 --> 01:20:45,262
Do you recognize me?

1068
01:20:49,409 --> 01:20:50,645
You remember me, don't ya?

1069
01:20:51,802 --> 01:20:54,436
You pretended to be San Te Monk

1070
01:20:54,515 --> 01:20:56,550
I'm Chou Jen Chieh from Shaolin

1071
01:20:56,670 --> 01:20:59,263
Well, I've never heard of you

1072
01:20:59,343 --> 01:21:01,417
I have to show you something

1073
01:21:01,497 --> 01:21:04,489
This is Chou Jen Chieh new from Shaolin

1074
01:21:04,569 --> 01:21:06,484
Damn it. What are you up to?

1075
01:21:06,564 --> 01:21:07,761
Don't move

1076
01:21:11,072 --> 01:21:13,985
You're screwing around again

1077
01:21:14,104 --> 01:21:16,379
No tricks; I closed the door myself

1078
01:21:16,498 --> 01:21:17,855
I'm afraid that you'll run off

1079
01:21:24,158 --> 01:21:25,036
Come on

1080
01:21:37,761 --> 01:21:39,317
How do you know Kung Fu?

1081
01:21:40,115 --> 01:21:42,588
This is nothing!

1082
01:21:48,613 --> 01:21:50,169
Watch carefully

1083
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:05,010
Don't worry!
Chou Jen Chieh learnt Kung Fu

1084
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:07,523
He'll avenge us

1085
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:23,761
Hold it! Great move!

1086
01:22:42,888 --> 01:22:43,965
Chief Ma is here

1087
01:22:44,763 --> 01:22:45,920
Not you again

1088
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,037
Excuse me

1089
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:06,905
Right...

1090
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:08,341
Come on

1091
01:23:48,171 --> 01:23:51,882
I'll show you the real thing

1092
01:23:53,435 --> 01:23:54,353
Using bamboo cord?

1093
01:23:54,712 --> 01:23:56,108
What kind of Kung Fu is that?

1094
01:23:58,382 --> 01:23:59,459
Scaffolding Kung Fu

1095
01:23:59,579 --> 01:24:00,896
Does that count?

1096
01:24:02,013 --> 01:24:03,409
Let me show you something new

1097
01:24:04,444 --> 01:24:06,120
A little by little

1098
01:24:07,873 --> 01:24:09,669
From now on...

1099
01:24:09,788 --> 01:24:11,464
You need to give everyone their dues

1100
01:24:11,584 --> 01:24:13,060
The pay that you owe them

1101
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,297
Stupid

1102
01:25:10,686 --> 01:25:12,322
Chief Ma

1103
01:25:12,442 --> 01:25:15,354
Now you've seen my real Kung Fu

1104
01:25:18,626 --> 01:25:20,979
Please hand them back their money...

1105
01:25:21,099 --> 01:25:24,091
If you're wise enough

1106
01:25:24,211 --> 01:25:25,288
Never

1107
01:27:07,053 --> 01:27:08,609
Mr. Huang Kao-Feng

1108
01:27:10,724 --> 01:27:12,639
You were the fake monk last time

1109
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:16,668
Yes. But I've been learning in Shaolin

1110
01:27:16,788 --> 01:27:18,982
I'm Chou Jen Chieh from Shaolin

1111
01:27:19,421 --> 01:27:22,493
No wonder you're so much better

1112
01:27:22,573 --> 01:27:26,363
I'm not here for revenge

1113
01:27:26,483 --> 01:27:28,677
I want you to give back the money

1114
01:27:28,757 --> 01:27:31,749
To all the workers
for the last three years

1115
01:27:32,746 --> 01:27:34,741
Guess, I'll give Shaolin Kung Fu a try

1116
01:27:34,821 --> 01:27:36,337
Today I'll have the honor

1117
01:27:36,457 --> 01:27:38,093
I'm ready for you

1118
01:27:40,965 --> 01:27:45,593
Please...

1119
01:27:45,713 --> 01:27:48,665
Guys, the boss is in trouble today

1120
01:27:48,785 --> 01:27:51,458
We'll close one day. Everyone

1121
01:27:57,459 --> 01:27:59,095
Mr. Huang

1122
01:27:59,175 --> 01:28:02,247
It's more convenient to try it here

1123
01:28:03,364 --> 01:28:06,915
You can show
whatever you've learnt in Shaolin

1124
01:28:06,995 --> 01:28:08,590
Try your best

1125
01:28:09,309 --> 01:28:11,982
Sure, I won't feel right
if I don't get it out

1126
01:28:12,101 --> 01:28:13,178
Then, please

1127
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,932
Great skill

1128
01:29:45,533 --> 01:29:46,969
Come on

1129
01:30:23,762 --> 01:30:24,680
All right then

1130
01:31:12,231 --> 01:31:14,744
Come up and try it yourself, Mr Wong

1131
01:33:08,521 --> 01:33:11,353
That's it, Mr. Wong

1132
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:14,505
I will hurt you

1133
01:33:14,585 --> 01:33:16,141
If we keep on going

1134
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:42,550
Let's stop, Mr. Wong

1135
01:33:44,425 --> 01:33:48,574
You might get hurt or even die

1136
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:16,422
The strength I used

1137
01:34:17,419 --> 01:34:19,694
It's like the pay cut

1138
01:34:19,813 --> 01:34:21,569
40 percent less

1139
01:34:40,097 --> 01:34:42,490
It increased to 70 percent now

1140
01:35:05,351 --> 01:35:07,027
Now 80%

1141
01:35:46,162 --> 01:35:50,989
Boss Wong, it's 90 percent now!

1142
01:35:51,787 --> 01:35:55,178
All right, Chou Jen Chieh... you win

1143
01:36:00,285 --> 01:36:02,439
Are you sure of that?

1144
01:36:02,559 --> 01:36:05,831
Yes. I indeed am

1145
01:36:07,825 --> 01:36:11,456
Good choice, Mr. Wong

1146
01:36:13,807 --> 01:36:15,363
Boss seems to be very tired

1147
01:36:15,483 --> 01:36:17,198
Please take him back to rest

1148
01:36:20,749 --> 01:36:21,587
Let's go

1149
01:36:25,457 --> 01:36:26,774
Please remember...

1150
01:36:26,893 --> 01:36:29,367
Pay all the workers their full wages

1151
01:36:29,447 --> 01:36:30,564
Definitely
