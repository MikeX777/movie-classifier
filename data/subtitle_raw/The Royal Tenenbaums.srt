<i>Royal Tenenbaum bought</i>

4

7
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,967
Are you
getting divorced?

8
00:08:13,007 --> 00:08:17,922
At the moment, no...
but... it doesn't look good.

9
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:19,764
Do you still
love us?

10
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:21,081
Of course I do.

11
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,560
Do you still love Mom?

12
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,438
Yes, very much, but your
mother's asked me to leave

13
00:08:24,487 --> 00:08:26,125
and I must respect
her position on the matter.

14
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,316
Is it our fault?

15
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,516
No.

16
00:08:28,567 --> 00:08:29,477
No.

17
00:08:29,527 --> 00:08:31,597
Obviously,
we made certain sacrifices

18
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:34,115
as a result of having children,
but, uh...

19
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,077
no, Lord, no.

20
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:37,243
Then why'd she
ask you to leave?

21
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:40,563
I don't really know anymore.

22
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:46,156
Maybe, uh, I wasn't as true
to her as I could've been.

23
00:08:46,207 --> 00:08:46,923
Well, she said...

24
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:47,922

176
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:31,962
<i>Raleigh St. Clair</i>.

177
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,600
I'm fine, thank you.

178
00:17:36,647 --> 00:17:38,126
You need to eat something.

179
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,520
May I make you dinner?

180
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:40,477
No, thank you.

181
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:52,480
<i>She was known</i>
<i>for her extreme secrecy</i>.

182
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:54,802
<i>For example, </i>
<i>none of the Tenenba<u>ums</u> knew</i>

183
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:58,044
<i>she was a smoker, which she</i>
<i>had been since the age of 12</i>.

184
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:00,442
<i>Nor were they aware</i>
<i>of her first marriage</i>

185
00:18:00,487 --> 00:18:03,047
<i>and di vorce to</i>
<i>a recording artist in Jamaica</i>.

186
00:18:03,087 --> 00:18:06,557
<i>She kept a pri vate studio</i>
<i>in Mockingbird Heights</i>

187
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:09,201
<i>under the name "Helen Scott. "</i>

188
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:12,762
<i>She had not completed a play</i>

189
00:18:12,807 --> 00:18:19,121
17 October, third examination
of Dudley Heinsbergen.

190
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:22,000
All right, Dudley

191
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:24,436
make yours like mine.

192
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:28,805
<i>Raleigh 's next book was</i>
<i>on the subject</i>

193
00:18:28,847 --> 00:18:31,805
<i>of a condi tion he called</i>
<i>"Heinsbergen Syndrome. "</i>

194
00:18:33,207 --> 00:18:35,163
Where's that
red one

195
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:37,084
going to go?

196
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:40,880
Done.

197
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:45,123
Good.

198
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,203
Very good.

199
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,719
My goodness.

200
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:53,486
How interesting.
How bizarre.

201
00:18:53,527 --> 00:18:56,280
Dudley suffers
from a rare disorder

202
00:18:56,327 --> 00:18:58,795
combining symptoms
of amnesia, dyslexia

203
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,724
and colour blindness.

204
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:03,042
He has a highly acute
sense of hearing.

205
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:04,566
There is also
evidence of...

206
00:19:04,607 --> 00:19:06,006
I'm not colour-blind, am I?

207
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:09,278
I'm afraid you are.

208
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:27,319
Ari, fire alarm!
Let's go!

209
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,766
Out you go!

210
00:19:28,807 --> 00:19:30,763
Let's go!

211
00:19:34,447 --> 00:19:36,517
Uzi, emergency! Let's go!

212
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:42,679
Uzi... what did I just say?!

213
00:19:42,727 --> 00:19:43,762
Look alive!

214
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,001
Fire!

215
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:46,321
<i>Chas 's wife Rachael</i>

00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:49,723
What about Buckley?

218
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:51,120
It's too late.
You forgot him.

219
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,600
Buckley! Buckley!

220
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:57,917
No elevator!
There's a fire.

221
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,082
Go, go!

222
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:01,322
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

223
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,916
<i>Chas and their two sons, </i>

<i>several thousand yards</i>
<i>from the crash si te</i>.

228
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,279
Four minutes, 48 seconds.

229
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:26,522
We're all dead,
burnt to a crisp.

230
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:28,159
<i>Over the last six months</i>

231
00:20:28,207 --> 00:20:30,767
<i>he had become increasingly</i>
<i>concerned wi th their safety</i>.

232
00:20:30,807 --> 00:20:32,684
We left Buckley.

233
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:34,718
It doesn't matter.

234
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:42,882
<i>Etheline became</i>
<i>an archaeologist</i>

235
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:44,519
<i>and had overseen excavations</i>

<i>for the Department of Housing</i>
<i>and the Transi t Authori ty</i>.

237
00:20:47,327 --> 00:20:49,204
Apropos of my question

238
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:53,923
regarding I-40
slash I-9 adjustments...

239
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:54,922
um...

240
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:58,602
<i>She taught a bridge class</i>
<i>twice a week</i>

241
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:01,286
<i>wi th her friend and business</i>
<i>manager, Hen<u>ry</u> Sherman</i>.

242
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:07,397
It would probably be
advantageous

243
00:21:07,447 --> 00:21:09,278
for your marital status

244
00:21:09,327 --> 00:21:11,716
to be legally established
as single

245
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:13,120
in light of the
circumstances.

246
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,236
What do you mean?

247
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:16,164
I mean for
tax purposes.

248
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:17,117
But I thought...

249
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:18,885
- Etheline...
- Yes?

250
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,519
Will you marry me?

251
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,641
I...

252
00:21:23,687 --> 00:21:24,961
I love you, uh...

253
00:21:25,007 --> 00:21:26,884
Did you already know that?

254
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:29,600
No, I didn't.

255
00:21:29,647 --> 00:21:31,683
<i>Since her separation</i>
<i>from her husband</i>

256
00:21:31,727 --> 00:21:33,319
<i>she had had many sui tors</i>...

257
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:43,120
...<i>but had not considered</i>
<i>a single one until this moment</i>.

258
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,603
This isn't really
a tax issue, is it?

259
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:49,684
That's true, uh...

260
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:52,446
I don't know why
I put it that way.

261
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,042
Let me think
about it, Henry.

262
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,917
Hello. Please tell Mr. Royal
this is the Pagoda.

263
00:22:07,607 --> 00:22:10,246
Lobby.

264
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,357
Thank you, Dusty.

265
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:13,965
You're welcome.

266
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,355
Good morning, Jerry.

267
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:18,601
Hmm...

268
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:22,401
Oh, there's a call for you,
Mr. Tenenbaum.

269
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:23,721
Who is it, Frederick?

270
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,519
A Mr. Pagoda.

271
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:31,080
What do you got?

272
00:22:31,127 --> 00:22:33,925
The black man asked her
to be his wife.

273
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,801
No shit?

274
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:39,519
What did Ethel say?

275
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,876
She think about it.

276
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:46,687
I don't like the sound of this
one damn bit, Pagoda.

277
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:49,560
I mean... Lord knows

278
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:53,202
I've had my share
of infidelities

279
00:22:53,247 --> 00:22:55,556
but she's still my wife.

280
00:22:57,647 --> 00:23:00,115
And no damn two-bit,
chartered accountant

281
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:02,476
is going to change that.

282
00:23:10,287 --> 00:23:12,039
Hi.

283
00:23:15,007 --> 00:23:19,603
Hey, Pagoda, give
us a hand, huh?

284
00:23:32,447 --> 00:23:34,403
Chas?

285
00:23:36,687 --> 00:23:37,802
What's going on?

286
00:23:37,847 --> 00:23:39,360
We got locked out
of our apartment.

287
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:41,602
Did you call a locksmith?

288
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:43,717
Uh-huh.

289
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:45,086
Well, I don't understand.

290
00:23:45,127 --> 00:23:47,357
Did you pack your bags
before you got locked out

291
00:23:47,407 --> 00:23:48,442
or how did you...?

292
00:23:48,487 --> 00:23:50,842
It's not safe over there.

293
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,879
Excuse me for a moment.

294
00:23:56,007 --> 00:23:57,759
What are you
tal<u>ki</u>ng about?

295
00:23:57,807 --> 00:23:58,762
The apartment.

296
00:23:58,807 --> 00:24:00,559
I have to get
some new sprinklers

297
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,802
and a backup
security system installed.

298
00:24:02,847 --> 00:24:05,839
But there are
no sprinklers
here, either.

299
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:08,845
Well, we might have
to do something about that, too.

300
00:24:12,127 --> 00:24:14,721
Okay.

301
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,758
Isn't this fun, huh?

302
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:17,922
Isn't this great?

303
00:24:17,967 --> 00:24:19,685
Feels like we're camping.

304
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:21,445
When are we going home?

305
00:24:21,487 --> 00:24:22,397
Huh?

306
00:24:22,447 --> 00:24:23,402
Hey, look at this.

307
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:26,643
Pretty cool,
huh?

308
00:24:26,687 --> 00:24:28,678
Who am I supposed to be?

309
00:24:28,727 --> 00:24:29,921
Who put that in here?

310
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:32,765
...Look at me

311
00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:37,440
What am I supposed to be?

312
00:24:37,487 --> 00:24:39,000
Okay.

313
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:41,766
Well, I will see you boys
in the morning.

314
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:42,922
Good night.
Good night.

315
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,036
Good night.

316
00:24:44,087 --> 00:24:45,998
Look at me

317
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:47,275
You know what?

318
00:24:47,327 --> 00:24:49,795
I think I'm going
to sleep in here with you.

319
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:52,520
That way...

320
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:56,162
...we can all be together.

321
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:59,279
Oh, my love

322
00:24:59,327 --> 00:25:01,841
Oh.

323
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:12,364
What <u>ki</u>nd of side effects
can be expected?

324
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:14,238
Well, there
are a number of
possibilities.

325
00:25:14,287 --> 00:25:16,118
Severe nausea
and dizziness
are standard.

326
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:18,920
A certain percentage
of patients may also
experience seizure.

327
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:21,686
You mean, like flopping around
on the floor and everything?

328
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:23,479
In some cases.

329
00:25:25,767 --> 00:25:29,476
You have a visitor,
my darling.

330
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,438
Who is it?

331
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:34,957
It's me, sweetie.

332
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:47,966
Raleigh says you've been
spending six hours a day

333
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:49,884
locked in here,
watching television

334
00:25:49,927 --> 00:25:51,246
and soa<u>ki</u>ng in the tub.

335
00:25:51,287 --> 00:25:53,801
I doubt that.

336
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:55,803
I don't think that's
very healthy, do you?

337
00:25:55,847 --> 00:25:57,519
Nor do I think
it's very intelligent

338
00:25:57,567 --> 00:26:00,206
to keep an electrical gadget
on the edge of the bathtub.

339
00:26:00,247 --> 00:26:01,965
I tie it to the radiator.

340
00:26:04,487 --> 00:26:07,047
Well, it can't be very good
for your eyes, anyway.

341
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:18,841
Chas came home.

342
00:26:18,887 --> 00:26:21,196
What do you mean?

343
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,477
He and Ari and Uzi
are going to stay

344
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:25,757
with me for a
little while.

345
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:29,243
Why are they allowed
to do that?

346
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,845
I don't know exactly

347
00:26:30,887 --> 00:26:33,606
but I think he's been
very depressed.

348
00:26:33,647 --> 00:26:35,205
So am I.

349
00:26:35,247 --> 00:26:37,442
So are you, what?

350
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:39,443
But why is <i>this</i> necessary?

351
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:42,604
'Cause I'm in a rut,
and I need a change.

352
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:44,763
Hang on.

353
00:26:48,927 --> 00:26:50,280
Taxi!

354
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:56,997
That cab has
a dent in it.

355
00:27:00,607 --> 00:27:02,563
You don't love me
anymore, do you?

356
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:04,563
I do, <u>ki</u>nd of.

357
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:06,359
I can't explain it
right now.

358
00:27:06,407 --> 00:27:09,524
Another dent here,
and another dent here.

359
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:20,086
I'll call you,
okay?

360
00:27:39,647 --> 00:27:42,002
Hello.

361
00:27:43,527 --> 00:27:45,119
Hello?

362
00:27:47,287 --> 00:27:49,881
Hello, beautiful.

363
00:28:00,127 --> 00:28:02,516
Got a minute?

364
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:04,398
What are you doing here?

365
00:28:04,447 --> 00:28:05,641
Uh, I need a favour.

366
00:28:05,687 --> 00:28:08,247
I want to spend some time
with you and the children.

367
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,039
Are you crazy?

368
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:11,315
Well, wait a minute,
damn it!

369
00:28:11,367 --> 00:28:12,436
Stop following me.

370
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:13,715
Well, I want
my family back.

371
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:15,166
Well, you can't have it.

372
00:28:15,207 --> 00:28:18,119
I'm sorry for you,
but it's too late.

373
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:19,441
Well, listen...

374
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:21,398
Baby, I'm dying.

375
00:28:23,047 --> 00:28:26,164
Yeah, I'm-I'm
sick as a dog.

376
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:29,085
I'll be dead
in six weeks.

377
00:28:29,127 --> 00:28:31,357
I'm dying.

378
00:28:37,887 --> 00:28:39,764
What are you tal<u>ki</u>ng about?

379
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:47,643
What's happening?

380
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,277
Oh, I'm sorry.

381
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,478
I didn't know.

382
00:29:02,127 --> 00:29:04,482
Well, what'd they say?

383
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:06,404
What is the prognosis?

384
00:29:06,447 --> 00:29:08,039
Take it easy, Ethel.

385
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:10,282
Now, hold-hold on,
baby, hold on.

386
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:13,205
Hold on, okay?

387
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:17,723
Ethel, hold on,
hold on.

388
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:18,961
Where is the doctor?

389
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,201
Don't...
Well, just...

390
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:21,475
W-Wait a second now.

391
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:22,721
Wait a second.

392
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:27,158
Okay, uh, listen,
I'm not dying...

393
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:28,845
but I need some time.

394
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:31,003
A month or so, okay?

395
00:29:31,047 --> 00:29:33,686
I want us...
I want us to-to...

396
00:29:33,727 --> 00:29:35,604
What's wrong with you?!

397
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:37,000
Damn!

398
00:29:37,047 --> 00:29:38,036
Ethel.

399
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:38,997
Are you crazy?!

400
00:29:39,047 --> 00:29:40,560
Ethel, baby...

401
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:43,644
I <i>am</i>dying.

402
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,601
Are you or aren't you?

403
00:29:56,647 --> 00:30:00,162
What? Dying?

404
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:02,277
Yeah.

405
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:06,520
Have you told your children?

406
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:07,920
More or less.

407
00:30:07,967 --> 00:30:09,685
And are they all right?

408
00:30:09,727 --> 00:30:11,240
It's hard to say.

409
00:30:11,287 --> 00:30:12,606
Who's your father?

410
00:30:12,647 --> 00:30:14,365
His name is Royal Tenenbaum.

411
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:16,079
You told us he
was already dead.

412
00:30:16,127 --> 00:30:17,924
Yeah, well, now
he's really dying.

413
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:18,922
- Ready.
- Print it.

414
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:20,320
I am very sorry, Margot.

415
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:21,322
That's okay.

416
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:23,164
We're not actually related,
anyway.

417
00:30:24,207 --> 00:30:25,162
True.

418
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:28,198
I'd like to send a response,
please.

419
00:30:28,247 --> 00:30:29,726
Yes, sir,
go ahead.

420
00:30:30,607 --> 00:30:31,517
Dear Mom<i>: </i>

421
00:30:31,567 --> 00:30:33,159
I received your message.

422
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:35,562
I'm coming home as soon
as possible.

423
00:30:35,607 --> 00:30:37,165
Who do I see about that?

424
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:40,995
<i>The ship 's porter arranged for</i>
<i>Richie to disembark at Halifax</i>

425
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,197
<i>and transfer</i>
<i>to a third-class stateroom</i>

<i>His trunks would not arri ve</i>

429
00:30:50,287 --> 00:30:52,118
Hey, Baumer.

430
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:53,998
Do you mind if we get
a picture with you?

431
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:55,241
Not at all.

432
00:30:57,167 --> 00:31:00,159
<i>He had made a request</i>
<i>for his usual escort</i>

433
00:31:00,207 --> 00:31:02,323
<i>the one from his days</i>

435
00:31:05,487 --> 00:31:06,886
Hi.

436
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:11,999
<i>As always, she was late</i>.

437
00:31:42,727 --> 00:31:46,766
I've been out wal<u>ki</u>ng

438
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:53,280
I don't do too much tal<u>ki</u>ng
these days

439
00:31:53,327 --> 00:31:57,957
These days

440
00:31:58,007 --> 00:32:00,567
These days I seem
to think a lot

441
00:32:00,607 --> 00:32:05,237
About the things
that I forgot to do...

442
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:10,637
And other times, I...

443
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:12,359
Stand up straight.

444
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:14,875
Let me get a look at you.

445
00:32:17,847 --> 00:32:20,202
What's so funny?

446
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:25,478
Well, it's nice to see you, too.

447
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,965
<i>That night, Etheline found</i>
<i>all of her children</i>

448
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:38,759
<i>li ving together</i>

449
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,365
<i>for the first time in 1 7 years</i>.

450
00:32:40,407 --> 00:32:41,681
Where's your dad?

451
00:32:48,807 --> 00:32:51,765
<i>The next morning, </i>
<i>Richie woke at dawn</i>.

452
00:32:51,807 --> 00:32:55,163
<i>He had decided birds should not</i>
<i>be kept in cages</i>

453
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:58,643
<i>fed Mordecai three sardines, </i>
<i>and set him free</i>.

454
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:39,001
I've missed the hell out of you,
my darlings.

455
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:41,277
Well, you know that, though,
don't you?

456
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:44,125
I hear you're dying.

457
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:46,203
So they tell me.

458
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:47,726
I'm sorry.

459
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:49,917
Well, I've had a good run.

460
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:52,117
You don't look so sic<u>k, </u> Dad.

461
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:53,805
Thank you.

462
00:33:53,847 --> 00:33:55,326
What have you got?

463
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,198
I've got a pretty bad case
of cancer.

464
00:33:57,247 --> 00:33:59,442
How long you
going to last?

465
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:01,717
Not long.

466
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:03,359
A month, a year?

467
00:34:03,407 --> 00:34:05,557
About six weeks.

468
00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:06,722
Let me get to the point.

469
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:09,076
The three of you and your mother
are all I've got

470
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:10,719
and I love you
more than anything.

471
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:11,756
Ho-ho!

472
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:13,160
- Ho-ho.
- Chas, let me

473
00:34:13,207 --> 00:34:15,038
finish here.

474
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:18,716
Now, I've got six weeks
to set things right with you

475
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,086
and I aim to do it.

476
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:21,845
Will you give me a chance?

477
00:34:21,887 --> 00:34:22,922
No.

478
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:23,763
You speak

479
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:24,842
for everyone?

480
00:34:24,887 --> 00:34:26,115
I speak for myself.

481
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:27,839
Well, you've
made your views known.

482
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:30,117
Let somebody else do some
of the tal<u>ki</u>ng now.

483
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:32,237
What do you
propose to do?

484
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:34,118
I can't say, really.

485
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:37,603
Um, make up for lost time,
I suppose.

486
00:34:37,647 --> 00:34:39,000
First thing I want to do is

487
00:34:39,047 --> 00:34:41,686
take you out to see
your grandmother, at some point.

488
00:34:41,727 --> 00:34:44,321
I haven't been out there
since I was six.

489
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:46,119
I haven't been
out there at all.

490
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,316
I was never invited.

491
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:49,801
Well, she wasn't
your real grandmother

492
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:53,601
and I never knew how much
interest you had, uh, sweetie.

493
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:55,444
Anyway, you're invited now.

494
00:34:55,487 --> 00:34:56,522
Thanks.

495
00:34:56,567 --> 00:34:58,478
You know,
Rachael's buried

496
00:34:58,527 --> 00:34:59,482
out there, too.

497
00:34:59,527 --> 00:35:00,676
Who?

498
00:35:00,727 --> 00:35:02,524
My wife.

499
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,761
Oh, that's right, isn't it?

500
00:35:03,807 --> 00:35:05,923
Well, we'll have to swing
by her grave, too.

501
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:14,083
Uh, I'll be right back.

502
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:15,162
Chas.

503
00:35:17,207 --> 00:35:18,162
Chas.

504
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:21,878
Can I see my grandsons?

505
00:35:21,927 --> 00:35:23,406
Why?

506
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:26,564
Because I finally want
to meet them.

507
00:35:27,927 --> 00:35:29,679
Don't give me that guff.

508
00:35:31,807 --> 00:35:33,684
I think we'll pass.

509
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:41,161
Pagoda...

510
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:44,040
where's my Havelina?

511
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:47,923
I'll say good-night
to you now, children.

512
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,286
Dad.

513
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:55,123
Thank you, my sweet boy.

514
00:35:58,487 --> 00:36:00,557
I'll contact you
in the next 12 hours

515
00:36:00,607 --> 00:36:02,120
with further instructions.

516
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:11,684
Look at that old

517
00:36:11,727 --> 00:36:14,321
grizzly bear.

518
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:16,483
Hello, Ethel.

519
00:36:16,527 --> 00:36:17,721
Good evening, sir.

520
00:36:17,767 --> 00:36:19,598
Hold the cab,
will you, driver?

521
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:21,160
Royal, this is Henry Sherman.

522
00:36:21,207 --> 00:36:22,322
Hey, lay it on me, man.

523
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:23,322
How do you do?

524
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:25,323
Not too well.
I'm dying.

525
00:36:27,287 --> 00:36:28,959
How's Richie?

526
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:30,645
I don't know.

527
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:32,325
I can't tell.

528
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:33,800
Yeah, me neither.

529
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:35,724
He wrote me a letter.

530
00:36:35,767 --> 00:36:37,917
He says he's
in love with you.

531
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:41,478
What are
you tal<u>ki</u>ng about?

532
00:36:41,527 --> 00:36:42,960
That's what he said.

533
00:36:43,007 --> 00:36:46,044
I don't know how we're
supposed to take it.

534
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:47,236
Hang on.

535
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:55,326
Hello.

536
00:36:55,367 --> 00:36:57,119
Sugar, it's Eli.

537
00:36:57,167 --> 00:36:58,600
Hey, baby, give me a second.

538
00:36:58,647 --> 00:37:00,239
What are we doing, Eli?

539
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:02,517
Oh, I just got to pick
something up.

540
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:06,238
Don't repeat that,
by the way.

541
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:07,197
About Richie.

542
00:37:07,247 --> 00:37:10,603
It was told to me in
confidence, and, you know...

543
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:16,641
Good.

544
00:37:16,687 --> 00:37:19,918
Now just remove
the loose soil

545
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:23,801
and note the
decomposition levels.

546
00:37:23,847 --> 00:37:25,678
I'm sorry to interrupt
your work.

547
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:27,797
Don't be silly.

548
00:37:27,847 --> 00:37:29,405
Come on.

549
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,915
I just want to apologise
for the other day

550
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:33,366
when I proposed to you.

551
00:37:33,407 --> 00:37:34,317
Why?

552
00:37:34,367 --> 00:37:35,686
I thought it was
very sweet.

553
00:37:35,727 --> 00:37:38,366
I know I'm not as accomplished
as some of the men

554
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:39,806
you've been involved with.

555
00:37:39,847 --> 00:37:42,566
Uh, Franklin Benedict,
General Cartwright

556
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:43,881
and your ex-husband.

557
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:45,155
Oh, that's ridiculous.

558
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:46,799
But, but, I feel...

559
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:49,600
I can offer
just as much as them.

560
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:53,003
I know I went about it
backwards, but...

561
00:37:53,047 --> 00:37:55,481
Henry, I have no interest
in Franklin Benedict

562
00:37:55,527 --> 00:37:57,279
or Doug Cartwright...
I never did...

563
00:37:57,327 --> 00:37:59,966
and as far as Royal's concerned,
he's the most...

564
00:38:00,007 --> 00:38:01,360
Henry?

565
00:38:04,327 --> 00:38:05,646
Henry, are you alright?

566
00:38:05,687 --> 00:38:07,564
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

567
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:10,917
Anyway, let me know
when you make up your mind.

568
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:13,765
Henry, wait a second.

569
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:17,595
I'm sorry, I'm very nervous.

570
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:19,319
Th-That's okay.

571
00:38:22,527 --> 00:38:24,483
Oh, thank you.

572
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:27,883
Why are you
so nervous?

573
00:38:27,927 --> 00:38:30,725
Well, to tell you
the truth

574
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:34,919
I haven't slept with
a man in 18 years.

575
00:38:34,967 --> 00:38:36,878
Dah-dah-dum

576
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:44,045
Dah-dah, dah-dah, dah,
dah-dum

577
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:50,965
Dah-dah, dah-dah-dah

578
00:38:54,207 --> 00:38:57,040
- Dah-dah, dah-dah, dah...

579
00:39:00,887 --> 00:39:04,482
La-dah-dah-dah-dah,
dah-dah...

580
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,640
Lah-dah-dah-dah-dah,
dah-dah...

581
00:39:14,007 --> 00:39:17,522
Dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah...

582
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:23,602
Dah, dah-dah-dah,
dah, dee...

583
00:39:28,007 --> 00:39:34,355
Dah, dah-dah-dah-dah,
dah-dah-dah...

584
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:35,681
Dah-dah, dah-dah...

585
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:38,241
That's a hell of an old
hound dog you got there.

586
00:39:38,287 --> 00:39:39,242
What's he go by?

587
00:39:39,287 --> 00:39:40,606
Buckley.

588
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:42,399
Buckley, sit.

589
00:39:46,727 --> 00:39:47,682
You know who I am?

590
00:39:48,727 --> 00:39:49,716
I'm Royal.

591
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:51,246
Have you heard of me?

592
00:39:53,447 --> 00:39:55,119
I'm very sorry for your loss.

593
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:57,681
Your mother was a terribly
attractive woman.

594
00:39:57,727 --> 00:39:58,762
Thank you.

595
00:39:58,807 --> 00:40:00,604
Which one are you?

596
00:40:00,647 --> 00:40:01,796
Ari.

597
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:03,439
Uzi, I'm your
granddad.

598
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:04,681
Hello.

599
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:07,195
I'm sorry we haven't gotten
to know each other.

600
00:40:07,247 --> 00:40:09,238
I don't get invited around
very much.

601
00:40:09,287 --> 00:40:11,482
What do you think of that,
by the way?

602
00:40:11,527 --> 00:40:12,721
Oh, you...

603
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,723
you don't have to say anything.

604
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:17,998
It's <u>ki</u>nd of a "fuck you"
to the old man, I guess.

605
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:19,321
How's your daddy?

606
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:20,277
Fine.

607
00:40:20,327 --> 00:40:21,237
You think so, huh?

608
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:23,084
How often has he got you
wor<u>ki</u>ng out?

609
00:40:23,127 --> 00:40:24,924
16 times a week.

610
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:26,877
Do me a favour.

611
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:28,440
Tell him you want to meet me.

612
00:40:28,487 --> 00:40:29,966
But we just met.

613
00:40:30,007 --> 00:40:30,962
No, we didn't.

614
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:33,441
Loo<u>k, </u> I'd like us to have
a relationship

615
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:36,718
but we have to pull some strings
to make it happen.

616
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,839
Now, here's what you tell him.
You say...

617
00:40:39,887 --> 00:40:41,923
<i>Well, I bet</i>
<i>Mom would have wanted us</i>

618
00:40:41,967 --> 00:40:43,320
<i>to meet him before he died</i>.

619
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:44,402
Wouldn't she?

620
00:40:44,447 --> 00:40:45,766
Don't you think?

621
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:02,716
She was a tough old broad,
wasn't she?

622
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:04,997
I wouldn't know.

623
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:06,480
Excuse me.
Come on.

624
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:07,562
Oh, that's right.

625
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:09,484
We've got another body
buried here, haven't we?

626
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:10,482
Uh, hold on.

627
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:14,644
Take some of these.

628
00:41:16,527 --> 00:41:17,721
Come on.

629
00:41:21,247 --> 00:41:23,807
So what do you think of
this big, old black buck

630
00:41:23,847 --> 00:41:24,836
moving in up there?

631
00:41:24,887 --> 00:41:26,400
Who?

632
00:41:26,447 --> 00:41:27,596
Henry Sherman.

633
00:41:27,647 --> 00:41:28,762
You know him?

634
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:30,126
Yeah.

635
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:31,919
Is he worth a damn?

636
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:35,522
I believe so.

637
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:42,598
What happened
to your finger?

638
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:43,557
Uzi, shh.

639
00:41:43,607 --> 00:41:44,562
It's okay, I'll tell you.

640
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:45,926
I'm adopted. Did you know that?

641
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:48,476
Well, I am.

642
00:41:48,527 --> 00:41:51,644
When I was 14, I went to find
my real family.

643
00:41:51,687 --> 00:41:52,836
They live in Indiana.

644
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:55,606
All right, now,
just set one of
them hickory trunks

645
00:41:55,647 --> 00:41:57,524
right up top there,
sister Maggie.

646
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:08,435
Did you try
to sew it back on?

647
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:10,921
Wasn't worth it.

648
00:42:17,687 --> 00:42:19,917
Hell of a damn grave.

649
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:23,277
Wish it were mine.

650
00:42:23,327 --> 00:42:24,555
It's a shame, isn't it?

651
00:42:24,607 --> 00:42:25,835
What?

652
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:28,355
Well, you probably
had another good
two or three years

653
00:42:28,407 --> 00:42:29,840
of competitive play in you.

654
00:42:29,887 --> 00:42:31,002
Probably.

655
00:42:31,047 --> 00:42:34,483
I had a lot riding on
that match, you know.

656
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:36,677
Financially
and personally.

657
00:42:36,727 --> 00:42:40,606
Why did you choke out
there that day, Baumer?

658
00:42:40,647 --> 00:42:43,525
Mr. Gandhi leads 40-15.

659
00:42:49,487 --> 00:42:51,239
That's 72 unforced errors

660
00:42:51,287 --> 00:42:52,561
for Richie Tenenbaum.

661
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:54,484
He's playing the worst tennis
of his life.

662
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:56,404
What's he feeling right now,
Tex Hayward?

663
00:42:56,447 --> 00:42:57,675
I don't know, Jim.

664
00:42:57,727 --> 00:42:59,797
There's obviously
something wrong with him.

665
00:42:59,847 --> 00:43:01,963
He's taken off his shoes
and one of his socks

666
00:43:02,007 --> 00:43:03,759
and... actually,
I think he's crying.

667
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,399
I think you're right.

668
00:43:05,447 --> 00:43:07,881
Who's he loo<u>ki</u>ng at
in the friends' box, Tex?

669
00:43:07,927 --> 00:43:09,724
That's his sister, Margot

670
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:11,678
and her new husband,
Raleigh St. Clair.

671
00:43:11,727 --> 00:43:13,604
They were just married
yesterday, Jim.

672
00:43:13,647 --> 00:43:15,126
Oh, yes.

673
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:23,164
I've never seen
anything like this.

674
00:43:23,207 --> 00:43:25,004
Neither have I.

675
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:28,244
Strange day out here
at Windswept Fields.

676
00:43:28,287 --> 00:43:30,721
I <u>ki</u>nd of disappeared
after that, didn't I?

677
00:43:30,767 --> 00:43:32,644
Yeah.

678
00:43:32,687 --> 00:43:35,520
But I understood.

679
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:38,684
I know you're not very good
with disappointment.

680
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:46,198
You still got
that little BB

681
00:43:46,247 --> 00:43:49,319
in your hand, Chassie?

682
00:43:55,727 --> 00:43:57,160
Why did you shoot me?

683
00:43:57,207 --> 00:43:59,004
It was the object of
the game, wasn't it?

684
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:00,366
No.

685
00:44:00,407 --> 00:44:02,762
We were on the same team.

686
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:04,763
Were we?

687
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:07,924
Well... you sued me.

688
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:09,878
Twice. Got me disbarred.

689
00:44:09,927 --> 00:44:12,680
I don't hold it
against you, do I?

690
00:44:12,727 --> 00:44:13,682
And how is it possible

691
00:44:13,727 --> 00:44:15,558
for Mr. Tenenbaum
to withdraw these funds

692
00:44:15,607 --> 00:44:17,165
without your written
authorisation?

693
00:44:17,207 --> 00:44:18,640
Objection, Your Honour.
Damn it, I...

694
00:44:18,687 --> 00:44:20,598
Why don't you leave
the objections to me, Royal?

695
00:44:20,647 --> 00:44:22,763
Because I started the
corporation when I was a minor.

696
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,320
So, my father
was the primary signatory

697
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:25,641
on most of my accounts.

698
00:44:25,687 --> 00:44:26,722
He also stole bonds

699
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:29,156
out of my safety deposit box
when I was 14.

700
00:44:33,287 --> 00:44:35,323
You think you could
start forgiving me?

701
00:44:40,287 --> 00:44:42,039
Why should I?

702
00:44:42,087 --> 00:44:43,964
Because you're
hurting me.

703
00:44:45,687 --> 00:44:46,915
Come on.

704
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:51,401
Were you in prison?

705
00:44:51,447 --> 00:44:52,357
Kind of.

706
00:44:52,407 --> 00:44:53,920
Minimum security.

707
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:56,276
I gotjacked
by the IRS.

708
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:57,555
Should we split?

709
00:44:57,607 --> 00:44:58,517
Yes, sir.

710
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:00,125
No, call me
Mr. Tenenbaum.

711
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:01,395
Okay.

712
00:45:01,447 --> 00:45:03,961
No, I'm <u>ki</u>dding:
call me Pappy.

713
00:45:04,007 --> 00:45:05,520
Okay.

714
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:09,116
Come on,
let's shag ass.

715
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:10,486
Well, just let me know

716
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,916
if you need somebody
to talk to, okay?

717
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:14,446
I like Raleigh
very much.

718
00:45:14,487 --> 00:45:16,682
I know he's a lot older
than you are

719
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:18,957
and you two are having
some problems

720
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,998
but... anyway,
maybe I can help.

721
00:45:21,047 --> 00:45:22,685
Okay. Thanks.

722
00:45:22,727 --> 00:45:25,446
Hey, Baumer!
All right!

723
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:30,356
All right! Ha!
Oh, shit! Oh, Jesus.

724
00:45:30,407 --> 00:45:33,604
By the way, I heard about
that letter you sent to Eli.

725
00:45:37,247 --> 00:45:40,080
You dropped
some cigarettes.

726
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,279
Those aren't mine.

727
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:46,602
They just fell
out of your pocket.

728
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:00,924
Oh, my Lord,
look at you.

729
00:46:06,167 --> 00:46:07,395
Come in.

730
00:46:10,807 --> 00:46:12,206
Did you tell Margot

731
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:14,397
about that letter
I wrote to you?

732
00:46:14,447 --> 00:46:16,517
Why? Did she mention it?

733
00:46:19,007 --> 00:46:21,567
Yes, I did.

734
00:46:21,607 --> 00:46:24,360
Why would she
have repeated that, I wonder?

735
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:27,001
Well, I would ask
you the same question.

736
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:29,956
Rightly so.

737
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:39,920
What'd you say?

738
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:41,525
Hmm?

739
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:42,886
What?

740
00:46:42,927 --> 00:46:45,157
I didn't say anything.

741
00:46:45,207 --> 00:46:47,243
When? Right now?

742
00:46:51,727 --> 00:46:53,558
I'm sorry: don't listen to me.

743
00:46:53,607 --> 00:46:54,835
I'm on mescaline.

744
00:46:54,887 --> 00:46:56,764
I've been spaced out all day.

745
00:46:58,727 --> 00:47:00,683
Did you say you're
on mescaline?

746
00:47:00,727 --> 00:47:02,558
I did, indeed.

747
00:47:02,607 --> 00:47:04,723
Very much so.

748
00:47:04,767 --> 00:47:07,042
How often do
you, uh...?

749
00:47:07,087 --> 00:47:08,725
I'm worried about you, Richie.

750
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:10,598
Why?

751
00:47:10,647 --> 00:47:13,400
Well, actually, Margot is,
for some reason.

752
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:14,721
But I did
find it odd

753
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:17,406
when you said
you were in love with her.

754
00:47:20,687 --> 00:47:22,279
She's married, you know.

755
00:47:22,327 --> 00:47:23,999
Yeah.

756
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:26,277
And she's your sister.

757
00:47:26,327 --> 00:47:28,636
Adopted.

758
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:40,557
Where are my encyclopedias?

759
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:41,926
They've been placed
in storage.

760
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:43,719
Well, damn you.
You're ta<u>ki</u>ng my encyclopedias.

761
00:47:43,767 --> 00:47:45,325
Th-this is humiliating.
I'm sorry.

762
00:47:45,367 --> 00:47:47,278
Would you like to make
a complaint in writing?

763
00:47:47,327 --> 00:47:48,396
Where am I
supposed to go?

764
00:47:48,447 --> 00:47:49,880
You're turning me
into a damn hobo.

765
00:47:49,927 --> 00:47:51,724
I'd be happy to make
a reservation for you

766
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:53,325
at another hotel.
You son of a bitch.

767
00:47:53,367 --> 00:47:54,641
Frederick.

768
00:47:54,687 --> 00:47:55,597
Hello there, Dusty.

769
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,160
Hello.

770
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,925
Could you spot
me a quarter?

771
00:47:58,967 --> 00:48:00,685
Of course.

772
00:48:01,687 --> 00:48:03,882
Richie? Hi.

773
00:48:03,927 --> 00:48:05,963
It's your dad.

774
00:48:09,127 --> 00:48:11,083
I think he's very lonely...

775
00:48:11,127 --> 00:48:12,845
lonelier than he lets on

776
00:48:12,887 --> 00:48:15,640
maybe lonelier
than he even realises.

777
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:18,326
Have you spoken
to him about this?

778
00:48:18,367 --> 00:48:20,403
Briefly,
and he agreed that we...

779
00:48:20,447 --> 00:48:22,722
I'm sorry, maybe I'm
a little confused here.

780
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:23,995
What are you
suggesting?

781
00:48:24,047 --> 00:48:26,242
That he come here
and stay in my room.

782
00:48:26,287 --> 00:48:28,676
Are you
out of your mind?

783
00:48:28,727 --> 00:48:30,046
No, I'm not.
Anyway, I think that

784
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:32,282
he'd be much more comfortable
here than he would...

785
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:33,203
Who gives a shit?

786
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:34,805
I do.

787
00:48:34,847 --> 00:48:35,996
You poor sucker.

788
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:38,242
You poor, washed-up
papa's boy.

789
00:48:38,287 --> 00:48:39,720
All right, let's not
get out of hand.

790
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:42,122
Please, don't get in the middle
of this, Mr. Sherman.

791
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:43,236
This is
a family matter.

792
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,357
Don't talk to him
like that.

793
00:48:45,407 --> 00:48:47,045
- Call me Henry.
- I prefer Mr. Sherman.

794
00:48:47,087 --> 00:48:48,566
Call him Henry.

795
00:48:48,607 --> 00:48:49,960
Why? I don't know him
that well.

796
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:51,235
You've known him
for ten years.

797
00:48:51,287 --> 00:48:52,879
As your accountant,
Mr. Sherman, yes.

798
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:54,155
Where are you
going to sleep?

799
00:48:54,207 --> 00:48:55,799
I'm just going
to camp out upstairs.

800
00:48:55,847 --> 00:48:57,166
We brought
our sleeping bag...

801
00:48:57,207 --> 00:48:58,117
Uzi!

802
00:48:58,167 --> 00:48:59,486
We don't mind, Dad.

803
00:48:59,527 --> 00:49:00,437
We like him.

804
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:01,442
Who, Pappy?

805
00:49:01,487 --> 00:49:02,397
"Pappy"?

806
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:04,199
He can sleep in
the room above us.

807
00:49:04,247 --> 00:49:05,726
Ari, it's not
your decision.

808
00:49:05,767 --> 00:49:06,995
Nor is it yours.

809
00:49:07,047 --> 00:49:08,639
Well, he's already up there.

810
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:12,605
What?!

811
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:13,796
I think he's asleep

812
00:49:13,847 --> 00:49:15,838
because of the medication
he's on

813
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:19,516
but I... I guess you can
wake him up and throw him out...

814
00:49:19,567 --> 00:49:22,639
if Mom says it's okay.

815
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:31,406
Get out.

816
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:33,438
Alright.

817
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:36,047
Let me just
collect my things.

818
00:49:37,967 --> 00:49:40,322
Would you mind handing
me my cane, Richie?

819
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:42,198
Let me see, where's
my suitcases?

820
00:49:42,247 --> 00:49:43,475
I'll get 'em.

821
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:44,721
Oh, thanks.

822
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:46,325
Oh!

823
00:49:46,367 --> 00:49:47,561
Dad!

824
00:49:48,807 --> 00:49:49,683
Mom!

825
00:49:49,727 --> 00:49:52,400
Grab me a Nembutal,
will you, son?

826
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,199
Are you okay?

827
00:49:54,247 --> 00:49:56,078
What the fuck you care?

828
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:57,924
Oh, my goodness.

829
00:49:57,967 --> 00:49:59,923
Pagoda?

830
00:49:59,967 --> 00:50:01,400
Call Dr. McClure.

831
00:50:04,887 --> 00:50:07,037
Take a breath and hold it.

832
00:50:09,087 --> 00:50:10,440
Now cough.

833
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:15,559
His condition is stable.

834
00:50:15,607 --> 00:50:17,837
The attack was
just a side effect.

835
00:50:17,887 --> 00:50:20,765
I recommend you push fluids

836
00:50:20,807 --> 00:50:23,162
and continue the stomach cancer
medication.

837
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:30,955
Can we move him?

838
00:50:31,007 --> 00:50:32,884
Absolutely not.

839
00:50:32,927 --> 00:50:34,963
For how long?

840
00:50:35,007 --> 00:50:36,759
We'll have to wait and see.

841
00:50:36,807 --> 00:50:38,525
Is he going to
be all right?

842
00:50:38,567 --> 00:50:40,478
That depends.
Is he a fighter?

843
00:50:40,527 --> 00:50:41,960
Yeah.

844
00:50:42,007 --> 00:50:43,725
Then that's the best we've got.

845
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:48,600
Pagoda's in possession

846
00:50:48,647 --> 00:50:50,638
of a parcel
containing my will

847
00:50:50,687 --> 00:50:53,918
and some instructions
for the funeral

848
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,003
including my epitaph,
for when the time comes.

849
00:50:56,047 --> 00:50:57,275
Proofread it for me

850
00:50:57,327 --> 00:50:59,522
before they carve it
on the headstone, okay?

851
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:01,125
Okay.

852
00:51:01,167 --> 00:51:04,523
I never did stop loving you,
by the way.

853
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:05,761
Do you believe that?

854
00:51:05,807 --> 00:51:07,320
Not really.

855
00:51:07,367 --> 00:51:09,801
You look terrific.

856
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:11,485
That dress is stunning.

857
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,438
Thanks.

858
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:39,279
Tears that angels cry...

859
00:51:39,327 --> 00:51:42,797
And the dark
and all the sky...

860
00:51:42,847 --> 00:51:45,122
Lights out, old man.

861
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:48,523
I thought I'd read
for a while, Chas.

862
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:51,240
Sorry. 11<i>: </i>30. Lights out.

863
00:51:51,287 --> 00:51:53,118
I'm right in the middle
of a sentence.

864
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:56,398
Well, you'll have to finish it
in the morning.

865
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,516
Them's the rules.

866
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,444
Chas?

867
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:03,126
Good night, my boy.

868
00:52:03,167 --> 00:52:06,159
When the one you love
says good-bye

869
00:52:08,127 --> 00:52:12,200
Sing a lullaby

870
00:52:12,247 --> 00:52:15,922
Dee-dee-dee,
dee-dee, dee-dee

871
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:20,085
Dee-dee-dee, dee-dee,
dee-dee...

872
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:22,846
Looks like you and Dad are
back together again, huh?

873
00:52:22,887 --> 00:52:25,720
He's your dad, too, Chas.

874
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,246
No, he's not.
Yes, he is.

875
00:52:27,287 --> 00:52:29,039
You really hate me,
don't you?

876
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:30,566
No. I don't. I love you.

877
00:52:32,207 --> 00:52:34,118
Well, I don't know
what you think

878
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:35,998
you're going to get out of this

879
00:52:36,047 --> 00:52:39,005
but believe me, whatever it is,
it's not worth it.

880
00:52:40,927 --> 00:52:43,202
Chas...

881
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:45,317
I don't want to hurt you.

882
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:47,881
I know what you and the boys
have been through.

883
00:52:47,927 --> 00:52:49,758
You're my brother,
and I love you.

884
00:52:49,807 --> 00:52:51,525
Stop saying that!

885
00:53:05,527 --> 00:53:08,758
What's thatjackass doing?

886
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:14,722
I know you, asshole!

887
00:53:24,927 --> 00:53:27,725
Did Eli send you that?

888
00:53:27,767 --> 00:53:29,485
Mm-hmm.

889
00:53:29,527 --> 00:53:32,360
He always sends me
his clippings.

890
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:35,046
What for?

891
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:37,237
I think he just likes
the encouragement.

892
00:53:37,287 --> 00:53:38,515
He's done it for years.

893
00:53:38,567 --> 00:53:41,764
He used to send me
his grades in college.

894
00:53:41,807 --> 00:53:43,843
That's ridiculous.

895
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,919
How long do you intend
to stay here?

896
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:56,117
I don't know.

897
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:59,204
Are you ever coming home?

898
00:53:59,247 --> 00:54:02,842
Maybe not.

899
00:54:02,887 --> 00:54:05,276
You're jo<u>ki</u>ng.

900
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:08,205
No.

901
00:54:10,567 --> 00:54:12,683
Well, I want to die.

902
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:19,159
Raleigh, please...

903
00:54:19,207 --> 00:54:21,323
Have you met
someone else?

904
00:54:23,407 --> 00:54:25,238
I couldn't even
begin to think about

905
00:54:25,287 --> 00:54:28,165
knowing how to answer
that question.

906
00:54:33,927 --> 00:54:36,566
I don't like the way
you're treating Raleigh.

907
00:54:39,927 --> 00:54:41,326
What are you tal<u>ki</u>ng about?

908
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:42,800
You don't even know him.

909
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:44,644
Well, I've met him,
and I don't think he deserves...

910
00:54:44,687 --> 00:54:47,645
Stay out of it.

911
00:54:47,687 --> 00:54:50,565
You're two-timing him
with that bloodsucker

912
00:54:50,607 --> 00:54:53,405
Eli Cash.

913
00:54:53,447 --> 00:54:56,245
Now, that's just not right,
damn it.

914
00:54:56,287 --> 00:54:58,278
You used to be a genius.

915
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:03,282
No, I didn't.

916
00:55:05,367 --> 00:55:07,961
Anyway, that's what
they used to say.

917
00:55:13,887 --> 00:55:16,276
Richard, I know you're
terribly close to Margot

918
00:55:16,327 --> 00:55:18,443
and probably understand
her better than anyone.

919
00:55:18,487 --> 00:55:21,365
May I confide in you?

920
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:27,837
Okay.

921
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:30,276
I believe she's
having an affair.

922
00:55:32,367 --> 00:55:33,595
I'm utterly devastated.

923
00:55:33,647 --> 00:55:37,117
I... don't know
where else to turn.

924
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,159
Will you advise me?

925
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:41,276
I don't know.

926
00:55:41,327 --> 00:55:42,521
What do you want
to do?

927
00:55:42,567 --> 00:55:43,682
I don't know.

928
00:55:43,727 --> 00:55:44,796
Perhaps, uh...

929
00:55:44,847 --> 00:55:46,200
Find the guy
and get him?

930
00:55:46,247 --> 00:55:47,919
Well, no, I
thought we could...

931
00:55:51,847 --> 00:55:54,042
Who do you think
it might be?

932
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:57,318
I don't know
at the moment.

933
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,598
Let's look
at the actuals, okay?

934
00:56:01,647 --> 00:56:03,603
I agree with you
a hundred percent.

935
00:56:03,647 --> 00:56:05,763
That's why we have
marketing grids.

936
00:56:05,807 --> 00:56:07,240
Hey.

937
00:56:07,287 --> 00:56:09,084
What do you say
we go down to Little Tokyo

938
00:56:09,127 --> 00:56:10,606
and get some fireworks?

939
00:56:10,647 --> 00:56:12,478
What do you need?

940
00:56:12,527 --> 00:56:14,597
Nothing.

941
00:56:14,647 --> 00:56:16,956
I see you got them,
uh, crunching numbers for you.

942
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:20,443
Please don't
come in this room.

943
00:56:20,487 --> 00:56:21,886
Chas has those boys cooped up

944
00:56:21,927 --> 00:56:23,758
like a pair ofjackrabbits,
Etheline.

945
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,240
He has his reasons.

946
00:56:25,287 --> 00:56:26,515
Oh, I know that

947
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:29,764
but you can't raise boys
to be scared of life.

948
00:56:29,807 --> 00:56:32,924
You got to brew
some recklessness into them.

949
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:36,437
I think that's
terrible advice.

950
00:56:36,487 --> 00:56:40,275
No, you don't.

951
00:56:40,327 --> 00:56:42,602
We take boxing
and self-defense classes.

952
00:56:42,647 --> 00:56:44,638
I'm not tal<u>ki</u>ng
about dance lessons.

953
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:46,439
I'm tal<u>ki</u>ng about
putting a brick

954
00:56:46,487 --> 00:56:48,398
through the other guy's
windshield.

955
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:52,520
I'm tal<u>ki</u>ng about ta<u>ki</u>ng it out
and chopping it up.

956
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:54,239
What do you mean?

957
00:56:54,287 --> 00:56:56,403
The mama pajama
rolled out of bed

958
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:58,244
And she ran
to the police station

959
00:56:58,287 --> 00:57:02,166
When the papa found out,
he began to shout

960
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,801
And he started
the investigation

961
00:57:04,847 --> 00:57:05,916
It's against the law

962
00:57:05,967 --> 00:57:07,002
Go!

963
00:57:07,047 --> 00:57:08,082
It was against the law

964
00:57:09,527 --> 00:57:12,041
What the mama saw,
it was against the law

965
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:16,806
The mama looked down
and spit on the ground

966
00:57:16,847 --> 00:57:19,236
Ev'ry time my name
gets mentioned

967
00:57:19,287 --> 00:57:21,596
The papa said,
"Oy, if I get that boy

968
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:24,639
I'm gonna stick him
in the house of detention"

969
00:57:24,687 --> 00:57:26,678
Well, I'm on my way

970
00:57:26,727 --> 00:57:29,036
I don't know where I'm goin'

971
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,679
I'm on my way

972
00:57:30,727 --> 00:57:32,285
I'm ta<u>ki</u>n' my time

973
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:33,555
But I don't know where

974
00:57:33,607 --> 00:57:37,316
Good-bye to Rosie,
the Queen of Corona...

975
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:38,959
Come here.

976
00:57:39,007 --> 00:57:42,124
See you, me and Julio
down by the schoolyard
That's it! Run!

977
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:46,001
See you, me and Julio
down by the schoolyard.

978
00:58:03,927 --> 00:58:05,326
Whoo-hoo!

979
00:58:05,367 --> 00:58:07,039
Yippee!

980
00:58:08,887 --> 00:58:10,923
He saved my life,
you know.

981
00:58:10,967 --> 00:58:14,437
30 years ago, I was
knifed in a bazaar
in Calcutta.

982
00:58:14,487 --> 00:58:17,001
He carried me to the
hospital on his back.

983
00:58:18,167 --> 00:58:20,044
Who stabbed you?

984
00:58:20,087 --> 00:58:21,156
He did.

985
00:58:21,207 --> 00:58:22,925
Yeah, there was
a price on my head

986
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:25,959
and he was a
hired assassin.

987
00:58:26,007 --> 00:58:29,283
Stuck me right
in the gut with
that. Shoot.

988
00:58:38,927 --> 00:58:40,645
Hey!

989
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:42,120
What?

990
00:58:43,247 --> 00:58:44,965
Where have you been?

991
00:58:45,007 --> 00:58:47,567
Uh, we just stepped
out to get some air.

992
00:58:48,847 --> 00:58:50,075
What's that?

993
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,196
Holy shit.

994
00:58:51,247 --> 00:58:52,646
That's not...?

995
00:58:52,687 --> 00:58:54,882
What is that?

996
00:58:54,927 --> 00:58:57,236
Oh, no, no,
that's, uh, dog's blood.

997
00:58:57,287 --> 00:58:58,561
Come here.

998
00:58:58,607 --> 00:58:59,756
What?

999
00:59:04,527 --> 00:59:05,880
You stay away
from my children.

1000
00:59:05,927 --> 00:59:07,201
Do you understand?

1001
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:09,044
My God, I haven't been
in here for years.

1002
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,520
Hey! Are you
listening to me!

1003
00:59:10,567 --> 00:59:12,000
Yes, I am!

1004
00:59:12,047 --> 00:59:14,481
I think you've having
a nervous breakdown!

1005
00:59:14,527 --> 00:59:16,119
I don't think
you recovered

1006
00:59:16,167 --> 00:59:17,395
from Rachael's death.

1007
00:59:17,447 --> 00:59:18,880
I...

1008
00:59:30,087 --> 00:59:31,998
There you are.

1009
00:59:43,207 --> 00:59:45,402
How are you feeling?

1010
00:59:45,447 --> 00:59:47,119
I'm having a ball.

1011
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:50,364
Scrapping and yelling
and mixing it up.

1012
00:59:50,407 --> 00:59:52,921
Loving every minute
with this damn crew.

1013
00:59:55,367 --> 00:59:57,244
I want to thank you
for raising our children

1014
00:59:57,287 --> 00:59:59,164
by the way.

1015
00:59:59,207 --> 01:00:01,198
Okay.

1016
01:00:01,247 --> 01:00:03,442
I'm not <u>ki</u>dding.

1017
01:00:03,487 --> 01:00:05,364
You always put them first,
didn't you?

1018
01:00:05,407 --> 01:00:06,965
I tried to.

1019
01:00:07,007 --> 01:00:09,840
Lately I feel like
maybe I didn't do
such a greatjob.

1020
01:00:09,887 --> 01:00:12,321
Goddamn it,
don't do that to yourself.

1021
01:00:12,367 --> 01:00:14,164
I'm the one
that failed them.

1022
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,118
Or, anyway,
it's nobody's fault.

1023
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:17,520
Plus, that...
it doesn't...

1024
01:00:17,567 --> 01:00:20,400
Why didn't you give
a damn about us, Royal?

1025
01:00:20,447 --> 01:00:23,280
Why didn't you care?

1026
01:00:23,327 --> 01:00:24,555
I don't know.

1027
01:00:24,607 --> 01:00:27,167
I'm ashamed of myself.

1028
01:00:29,887 --> 01:00:32,401
I'll tell you
one thing, though...

1029
01:00:32,447 --> 01:00:35,280
you got more grit,
fire and guts

1030
01:00:35,327 --> 01:00:38,160
than any woman
I have ever met.

1031
01:00:38,207 --> 01:00:40,243
What... what are you
smiling about?

1032
01:00:40,287 --> 01:00:41,640
Nothing.

1033
01:00:41,687 --> 01:00:43,120
No, wha...
what's so funny?

1034
01:00:43,167 --> 01:00:44,236
Nothing.

1035
01:00:44,287 --> 01:00:46,596
It's these little
expressions of yours.

1036
01:00:46,647 --> 01:00:48,717
I don't know
what you're tal<u>ki</u>ng about

1037
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,962
but I'll take it
as a compliment.

1038
01:00:53,047 --> 01:00:55,242
You're true blue, Ethel.

1039
01:00:55,287 --> 01:00:57,403
You really are.

1040
01:01:00,207 --> 01:01:02,846
How's your love life?

1041
01:01:02,887 --> 01:01:04,479
None of your business.

1042
01:01:13,607 --> 01:01:15,484
I'd like you to talk
to Royal about us

1043
01:01:15,527 --> 01:01:16,801
if you don't mind.

1044
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:20,442
I don't think the timing's right
for that, Henry.

1045
01:01:20,487 --> 01:01:21,886
Well, I'd agree

1046
01:01:21,927 --> 01:01:24,885
if I thought he was really
going to die in six weeks

1047
01:01:24,927 --> 01:01:26,838
but I don't.

1048
01:01:28,487 --> 01:01:30,762
Well, I hope you're right.

1049
01:01:30,807 --> 01:01:36,245
Actually, I don't believe
I'll join you tonight.

1050
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:39,165
I'll call you in the morning.

1051
01:01:46,487 --> 01:01:47,806
She said that?

1052
01:01:49,967 --> 01:01:52,162
Great.

1053
01:01:52,207 --> 01:01:55,677
Got the sucker
on the ropes.

1054
01:02:11,846 --> 01:02:13,996
Can I ask you
something, Hank?

1055
01:02:18,406 --> 01:02:20,397
Okay.

1056
01:02:22,046 --> 01:02:23,877
Are you trying
to steal my woman?

1057
01:02:25,206 --> 01:02:26,924
I beg your pardon?

1058
01:02:26,966 --> 01:02:28,843
You heard me, Coltrane.

1059
01:02:28,886 --> 01:02:30,717
Coltrane?

1060
01:02:30,766 --> 01:02:32,404
What?

1061
01:02:32,446 --> 01:02:34,164
Did you just call me "Coltrane"?

1062
01:02:34,206 --> 01:02:35,400
No.

1063
01:02:35,446 --> 01:02:36,435
You didn't?

1064
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:38,636
No.

1065
01:02:38,686 --> 01:02:40,836
Okay.

1066
01:02:42,646 --> 01:02:44,238
But if I did...

1067
01:02:45,806 --> 01:02:48,639
you wouldn't be able to do
anything about it, would you?

1068
01:02:48,686 --> 01:02:50,278
You don't think so?

1069
01:02:50,326 --> 01:02:51,725
No, I don't.

1070
01:02:51,766 --> 01:02:52,960
Listen, Royal

1071
01:02:53,006 --> 01:02:54,598
if you think you
can march in here...

1072
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:55,920
You want to talk some jive?

1073
01:02:55,966 --> 01:02:58,161
I'll talk some jive.

1074
01:02:58,206 --> 01:02:59,798
I'll talk some jive
like you've never heard.

1075
01:02:59,846 --> 01:03:01,120
- Oh, yeah?
- Right on!

1076
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:02,679
Sit down.
What?!

1077
01:03:02,726 --> 01:03:03,636
Wh-what did you say?

1078
01:03:03,686 --> 01:03:04,641
I said sit down,
goddamn it!

1079
01:03:04,686 --> 01:03:06,404
Oh, I heard you!
I want you out of my house!

1080
01:03:06,446 --> 01:03:07,435
This is not
your house!

1081
01:03:07,486 --> 01:03:08,805
I want your
raggedy ass out!

1082
01:03:08,846 --> 01:03:10,074
Don't talk
semantics with me.

1083
01:03:10,126 --> 01:03:11,036
Oh, this is
not your...

1084
01:03:11,086 --> 01:03:12,758
What's going on here?

1085
01:03:12,806 --> 01:03:14,717
Nothing.

1086
01:03:17,806 --> 01:03:20,274
Mmm.

1087
01:03:37,406 --> 01:03:40,443
Hello, I'm calling in regards
to a Dr. McClure... yes...

1088
01:03:40,486 --> 01:03:42,204
at Colby General.

1089
01:03:42,246 --> 01:03:44,680
The name of the patient
is Royal Tenenbaum.

1090
01:03:44,726 --> 01:03:46,603
Hmm...

1091
01:03:46,646 --> 01:03:50,559
Is that a Tic-Tac?

1092
01:03:59,886 --> 01:04:02,525
How much is he paying you?

1093
01:04:02,566 --> 01:04:06,354
I don't know what
you're tal<u>ki</u>ng about.

1094
01:04:06,406 --> 01:04:09,000
Well, I grew up
with the Tenenbaum
family, you know.

1095
01:04:09,046 --> 01:04:10,001
Right.

1096
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:11,161
Across the street.

1097
01:04:11,206 --> 01:04:12,321
Mm-hmm.

1098
01:04:12,366 --> 01:04:14,436
They've fallen on hard times
now, haven't they?

1099
01:04:14,486 --> 01:04:16,363
I can't say no.

1100
01:04:16,406 --> 01:04:17,964
This is bullshit.

1101
01:04:18,006 --> 01:04:19,280
Change it, huh?

1102
01:04:21,606 --> 01:04:23,756
What did you do
to your hand?

1103
01:04:23,806 --> 01:04:26,559
Uh, nothing.

1104
01:04:28,646 --> 01:04:30,682
Can we get somebody over here

1105
01:04:30,726 --> 01:04:32,796
to <u>ki</u>ll these mice for us?

1106
01:04:32,846 --> 01:04:34,757
No. They belong
to Chas.

1107
01:04:34,806 --> 01:04:37,366
Or anyway,
he invented them.

1108
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:39,681
Well, get him to stick them
in a fuc<u>ki</u>ng cage

1109
01:04:39,726 --> 01:04:42,081
or something.

1110
01:04:42,126 --> 01:04:45,357
Etheline... mind coming up here
for a minute, please?

1111
01:04:45,406 --> 01:04:47,840
What's coo<u>ki</u>ng, Pops?

1112
01:04:47,886 --> 01:04:49,956
You'll see.

1113
01:04:50,006 --> 01:04:50,802
Now, your previous novel...

1114
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:52,120
Yes. <i>Wildcat</i>.

1115
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:53,121
Right.

1116
01:04:53,166 --> 01:04:55,316
Not a success.

1117
01:04:55,366 --> 01:04:56,924
Why?

1118
01:05:01,286 --> 01:05:05,359
Well, <i>Wildcat</i> was written
in a <u>ki</u>nd of obsolete

1119
01:05:05,406 --> 01:05:07,317
vernacular...

1120
01:05:10,366 --> 01:05:12,516
<i>Wildcat</i>...

1121
01:05:12,566 --> 01:05:15,160
<i>Wild</i>... <i>cat</i>...

1122
01:05:19,886 --> 01:05:21,797
<i>Wildcat</i>...

1123
01:05:23,126 --> 01:05:24,878
I'm going to go.

1124
01:05:24,926 --> 01:05:27,076
I'm ta<u>ki</u>ng this off
and I'm going.

1125
01:05:27,126 --> 01:05:28,320
Stepping out.

1126
01:05:28,366 --> 01:05:31,085
What the hell
<u>ki</u>nd of way to act is that?

1127
01:05:31,126 --> 01:05:32,400
Open the door.

1128
01:05:32,446 --> 01:05:33,481
He's on drugs.

1129
01:05:33,526 --> 01:05:36,563
I'll be
right back.

1130
01:05:38,646 --> 01:05:39,874
James Bradley...

1131
01:05:39,926 --> 01:05:41,723
Hold on a
minute, please.

1132
01:05:41,766 --> 01:05:42,881
What's going on?

1133
01:05:42,926 --> 01:05:45,315
Pagoda has
something to say.

1134
01:05:49,766 --> 01:05:52,234
He has a cancer.

1135
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:54,481
No, he doesn't.

1136
01:05:54,526 --> 01:05:56,482
I know what stomach cancer
looks like.

1137
01:05:56,526 --> 01:05:58,039
I've seen it.

1138
01:05:58,086 --> 01:06:00,316
And you don't eat

1139
01:06:00,366 --> 01:06:03,756
three cheeseburgers a day
with French fries if you got it.

1140
01:06:03,806 --> 01:06:05,080
The pain
is excruciating.

1141
01:06:05,126 --> 01:06:06,957
How would you know?

1142
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:08,917
My wife had it.

1143
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:13,039
Not only is there
no Dr. McClure
at Colby General

1144
01:06:13,086 --> 01:06:15,122
there is no
Colby General.

1145
01:06:15,166 --> 01:06:17,555
It closed in 1974.

1146
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:19,164
Aw, shit, man.

1147
01:06:19,206 --> 01:06:21,117
Oh, shit, man.

1148
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:32,674
Yes, can you send
a taxi

1149
01:06:32,726 --> 01:06:34,398
to 111 Archer Avenue
right away, please?

1150
01:06:34,446 --> 01:06:35,356
Thank you.

1151
01:06:42,966 --> 01:06:46,481
I guess we're back out
on the street, huh, pal?

1152
01:06:46,526 --> 01:06:48,676
Were you part of this,
Pagoda?

1153
01:06:48,726 --> 01:06:50,239
Of course he was.

1154
01:06:50,286 --> 01:06:51,639
No, well, yeah, he was

1155
01:06:51,686 --> 01:06:53,961
but, I mean,
he wasn't <i>that</i> involved.

1156
01:06:54,006 --> 01:06:56,679
Where'd you get all
these medical supplies?

1157
01:06:56,726 --> 01:06:59,115
A guy at St. Pete's
owed me a favour.

1158
01:06:59,166 --> 01:07:02,761
I did some malpractice work
for him.

1159
01:07:02,806 --> 01:07:05,559
I do have
high blood pressure, though.

1160
01:07:08,206 --> 01:07:11,437
Loo<u>k, </u> I know I'm going to be
the bad guy on this one.

1161
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:14,717
But I just want to say,
the last six days have been

1162
01:07:14,766 --> 01:07:17,519
the best six days
of probably my whole life.

1163
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,796
<i>Immediately after</i>
<i>making this statement</i>

1164
01:07:19,846 --> 01:07:22,280
<i>Royal realised</i>
<i>that i t was true</i>.

1165
01:07:27,566 --> 01:07:30,364
Why'd you do this to us, Royal?

1166
01:07:30,406 --> 01:07:33,523
What was the point?

1167
01:07:33,566 --> 01:07:35,716
I thought I could win you back.

1168
01:07:35,766 --> 01:07:39,520
And then I thought I could
get rid of Henry...

1169
01:07:39,566 --> 01:07:42,080
and at least keep
the status quo.

1170
01:07:42,126 --> 01:07:43,764
But we hadn't spoken
in seven years.

1171
01:07:43,806 --> 01:07:45,034
I know.

1172
01:07:46,366 --> 01:07:48,596
Plus, uh...

1173
01:07:48,646 --> 01:07:50,841
I was broke.

1174
01:07:52,206 --> 01:07:54,515
And I got <u>ki</u>cked out
of my hotel.

1175
01:07:54,566 --> 01:07:57,239
You're a bastard.

1176
01:07:57,286 --> 01:07:59,880
Good-bye, Royal.

1177
01:08:11,926 --> 01:08:14,804
Take it easy on
those boys, Chassie.

1178
01:08:14,846 --> 01:08:17,724
I don't want this
to happen to you.

1179
01:08:26,726 --> 01:08:29,365
You know, Richie, this illness,
this closeness to death

1180
01:08:29,406 --> 01:08:31,283
has had a profound effect
on me.

1181
01:08:31,326 --> 01:08:34,124
I-I feel like a different
person, I really do.

1182
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:38,603
Dad, you were
never dying.

1183
01:08:40,406 --> 01:08:42,636
But I'm going to live.

1184
01:08:52,326 --> 01:08:54,999
He's not your father.

1185
01:08:55,046 --> 01:08:57,799
Neither are you.

1186
01:09:28,646 --> 01:09:30,762
You son of a bitch!

1187
01:09:30,806 --> 01:09:33,036
God... damn...

1188
01:09:35,686 --> 01:09:37,916
That's the last time you put
a knife in me, hear me?

1189
01:09:47,286 --> 01:09:51,120
The 375th Street Y,
please.

1190
01:10:05,966 --> 01:10:08,002
Everyone's against me.

1191
01:10:08,046 --> 01:10:09,877
It's your
fault, man.

1192
01:10:09,926 --> 01:10:13,475
Yeah, I know, but damn it,
I want this family to love me.

1193
01:10:13,526 --> 01:10:14,675
How much money you got?

1194
01:10:14,726 --> 01:10:15,954
I don't have.

1195
01:10:16,006 --> 01:10:17,678
What, you're broke?

1196
01:10:17,726 --> 01:10:20,035
You got to be <u>ki</u>dding me.

1197
01:10:20,086 --> 01:10:22,042
How are we going to pay
for this room?

1198
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:27,122
All right,
we'll think of something.

1199
01:10:28,966 --> 01:10:30,479
Ow.

1200
01:10:47,246 --> 01:10:51,637
I'm not in love
with you anymore.

1201
01:10:51,686 --> 01:10:54,154
I didn't know
you ever were.

1202
01:10:54,206 --> 01:10:55,798
Let's not make this
any more difficult

1203
01:10:55,846 --> 01:10:57,518
than it already is.

1204
01:10:59,486 --> 01:11:02,125
Okay.

1205
01:11:02,166 --> 01:11:04,839
Okay, what?

1206
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:08,674
Okay, I'm not in love
with you, either.

1207
01:11:08,726 --> 01:11:12,275
Yes, I know: you're
in love with Richie

1208
01:11:12,326 --> 01:11:14,521
which is sic<u>k, </u>
and gross.

1209
01:11:18,326 --> 01:11:21,796
Do you send my mother
your clippings...

1210
01:11:21,846 --> 01:11:23,996
and your grades
from college?

1211
01:11:26,366 --> 01:11:29,802
Please stop belittling me.

1212
01:11:37,046 --> 01:11:39,002
You never gave me
the time of day

1213
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:41,276
till I started getting
good reviews.

1214
01:11:41,326 --> 01:11:44,204
Your reviews
aren't that good.

1215
01:11:44,246 --> 01:11:46,476
But the sales are.

1216
01:11:53,206 --> 01:11:57,245
Gentlemen... how much
do you already know?

1217
01:11:57,286 --> 01:12:00,198
Very little, I'm afraid.

1218
01:12:00,246 --> 01:12:02,077
Would you like
to examine the report?

1219
01:12:02,126 --> 01:12:04,515
Yes.

1220
01:12:15,046 --> 01:12:17,321
Jac<u>ki</u>e is a pun<u>k, </u>
Judy is a runt

1221
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:21,723
They both went down to Berlin,
joined the Ice Capades

1222
01:12:21,766 --> 01:12:23,643
And, oh, I don't know why

1223
01:12:23,686 --> 01:12:26,154
Oh, I don't know why

1224
01:12:26,206 --> 01:12:28,561
Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah

1225
01:12:28,606 --> 01:12:30,324
Perhaps they'll die

1226
01:12:30,366 --> 01:12:31,355
Oh, yeah

1227
01:12:31,406 --> 01:12:33,966
Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah

1228
01:12:34,006 --> 01:12:36,236
Perhaps
they'll die, oh, yeah

1229
01:12:36,286 --> 01:12:39,596
Second verse,
same as the first

1230
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:41,955
Jac<u>ki</u>e is a pun<u>k, </u>
Judy is a runt

1231
01:12:42,006 --> 01:12:45,760
They both went down to Berlin,
joined the Ice Capades

1232
01:12:45,806 --> 01:12:48,559
And, oh, I don't know why

1233
01:12:48,606 --> 01:12:50,676
Oh, I don't know why

1234
01:12:50,726 --> 01:12:53,001
Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah

1235
01:12:53,046 --> 01:12:54,638
Perhaps they'll die

1236
01:12:54,686 --> 01:12:55,755
Oh, yeah

1237
01:12:55,806 --> 01:12:57,956
Perhaps
they'll die, oh, yeah

1238
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:01,237
Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah

1239
01:13:11,126 --> 01:13:14,004
Third verse,
different from the first

1240
01:13:14,046 --> 01:13:15,161
Jac<u>ki</u>e is a punk...

1241
01:13:22,126 --> 01:13:23,684
She smokes.

1242
01:13:23,726 --> 01:13:25,603
Yes.

1243
01:13:31,286 --> 01:13:32,401
All right, well.

1244
01:13:32,446 --> 01:13:34,562
Everything seems
to be in order.

1245
01:13:34,606 --> 01:13:37,484
I'll contact you
in the next 24 hours.

1246
01:13:37,526 --> 01:13:38,925
I appreciate that.

1247
01:13:38,966 --> 01:13:42,197
Uh, which way are you leaning,
by the way?

1248
01:13:42,246 --> 01:13:43,520
I'll inform you
of my decision

1249
01:13:43,566 --> 01:13:44,635
at the appropriate time.

1250
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:46,005
I get it.

1251
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:48,321
Uh, Dusty, put in a good word
for us, will you?

1252
01:13:48,366 --> 01:13:49,719
I already did.

1253
01:13:54,806 --> 01:13:56,797
You want to play
some word games

1254
01:13:56,846 --> 01:13:59,485
or do some experiments
on me or anything?

1255
01:13:59,526 --> 01:14:01,437
No.

1256
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:05,244
Your hand on his arm

1257
01:14:05,286 --> 01:14:07,322
Haystack charm

1258
01:14:07,366 --> 01:14:09,118
Around your neck

1259
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:11,202
Strung out and thin

1260
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:15,364
Calling some friend,
trying to cash some cheque

1261
01:14:15,406 --> 01:14:18,000
He's acting dumb

1262
01:14:18,046 --> 01:14:21,834
That's what you've come...
to expect

1263
01:14:21,886 --> 01:14:26,118
Needle in the hay

1264
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:29,283
Needle in the hay

1265
01:14:29,326 --> 01:14:33,444
Needle in the hay

1266
01:14:33,486 --> 01:14:36,796
Needle in the hay

1267
01:14:49,686 --> 01:14:51,563
He's wearin' your clothes

1268
01:14:51,606 --> 01:14:53,005
Head down to toes

1269
01:14:53,046 --> 01:14:55,321
A reaction to you

1270
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:57,038
You say you know what he did

1271
01:14:57,086 --> 01:14:59,236
But you idiot <u>ki</u>d

1272
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:01,481
You don't have a clue

1273
01:15:01,526 --> 01:15:03,084
Sometimes they just

1274
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:05,162
Get caught in the eye

1275
01:15:05,206 --> 01:15:07,515
You're pulling him through

1276
01:15:07,566 --> 01:15:11,275
Needle in the hay

1277
01:15:11,326 --> 01:15:13,044
Needle in the hay...

1278
01:15:13,086 --> 01:15:15,520
I'm going to <u>ki</u>ll myself
tomorrow.

1279
01:15:15,566 --> 01:15:19,115
Needle in the hay

1280
01:15:19,166 --> 01:15:22,238
Needle in the hay.

1281
01:16:03,966 --> 01:16:05,877
Dudley, where is he?

1282
01:16:07,646 --> 01:16:09,284
Who?

1283
01:16:12,126 --> 01:16:14,276
He'll probably sleep
for several hours

1284
01:16:14,326 --> 01:16:16,601
and then I'll come back
to check on him.

1285
01:16:16,646 --> 01:16:17,874
All right?

1286
01:16:21,766 --> 01:16:24,200
How are you feeling?

1287
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:25,838
Fine, thanks.

1288
01:16:25,886 --> 01:16:28,195
Are you in any pain?

1289
01:16:28,246 --> 01:16:29,520
Not really.

1290
01:16:29,566 --> 01:16:30,794
Why'd you try
to <u>ki</u>ll yourself?

1291
01:16:30,846 --> 01:16:32,404
Don't press
him right now.

1292
01:16:32,446 --> 01:16:34,596
I wrote a suicide note.

1293
01:16:34,646 --> 01:16:35,999
You did?

1294
01:16:36,046 --> 01:16:37,274
Yeah.

1295
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:40,204
Right after I regained
consciousness.

1296
01:16:42,046 --> 01:16:43,718
Can we read it?

1297
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:44,881
No.

1298
01:16:44,926 --> 01:16:47,884
Can you paraphrase
it for us?

1299
01:16:47,926 --> 01:16:50,440
I don't think so.

1300
01:16:50,486 --> 01:16:52,442
Is it dark?

1301
01:16:52,486 --> 01:16:53,805
Of course it's dark.

1302
01:16:53,846 --> 01:16:55,199
It's a suicide note.

1303
01:16:55,246 --> 01:16:56,645
All right,
that's enough.

1304
01:16:56,686 --> 01:16:58,404
Doctor said
to let him sleep.

1305
01:17:01,686 --> 01:17:03,642
What?!

1306
01:17:07,486 --> 01:17:09,363
Cover for us,
will you, Dusty?

1307
01:17:09,406 --> 01:17:10,919
Yes. Yes, Royal.

1308
01:17:21,046 --> 01:17:25,164
You've made a
cuckold of me.

1309
01:17:25,206 --> 01:17:28,164
I know.

1310
01:17:28,206 --> 01:17:31,562
Many times over.

1311
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:35,042
I'm sorry.

1312
01:17:35,086 --> 01:17:37,316
And you nearly <u>ki</u>lled
your poor brother.

1313
01:17:37,366 --> 01:17:40,358
What's he tal<u>ki</u>ng about?

1314
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,920
It doesn't matter.

1315
01:17:42,966 --> 01:17:45,958
She's balling Eli Cash.

1316
01:17:46,006 --> 01:17:47,917
Oh, my goodness.

1317
01:17:50,926 --> 01:17:53,281
May I have a cigarette?

1318
01:17:53,326 --> 01:17:56,363
What?

1319
01:17:56,406 --> 01:17:59,682
Shall I repeat
the question?

1320
01:17:59,726 --> 01:18:01,762
You don't smoke.

1321
01:18:01,806 --> 01:18:03,717
I know that.

1322
01:18:14,406 --> 01:18:17,159
And a light.

1323
01:18:24,446 --> 01:18:26,437
<i>Au revoir</i>.

1324
01:18:35,366 --> 01:18:38,995
How long have you been
a smoker?

1325
01:18:39,046 --> 01:18:41,514
22 years.

1326
01:18:42,526 --> 01:18:44,881
Well, I think
you should quit.

1327
01:18:53,726 --> 01:18:55,842
How can I help?

1328
01:18:57,606 --> 01:19:00,643
Let me look at these forms.

1329
01:19:12,646 --> 01:19:14,557
Oh, Henry.

1330
01:19:21,646 --> 01:19:23,443
Richie Tenenbaum, please.

1331
01:19:23,486 --> 01:19:24,601
Your name?

1332
01:19:24,646 --> 01:19:25,715
Royal Tenenbaum.

1333
01:19:25,766 --> 01:19:28,724
I'm afraid visiting
hours are over, sir.

1334
01:19:28,766 --> 01:19:31,485
Wh-Wh-What does it say there...
they don't want me?

1335
01:19:31,526 --> 01:19:32,641
I-I'm sorry.

1336
01:19:32,686 --> 01:19:34,005
I have to refer you
to Dr. Burrows.

1337
01:19:34,046 --> 01:19:36,196
He'll be in
tomorrow afternoon.

1338
01:19:49,286 --> 01:19:51,163
We could shimmy up
that gutter

1339
01:19:51,206 --> 01:19:53,037
jump over that window ledge

1340
01:19:53,086 --> 01:19:56,158
and then, uh, pry open
that ventilator shaft.

1341
01:19:56,206 --> 01:19:57,878
There he is.

1342
01:19:57,926 --> 01:19:59,154
Richie!

1343
01:20:00,886 --> 01:20:02,717
Richie.

1344
01:20:04,686 --> 01:20:07,154
Where's he going?

1345
01:20:08,486 --> 01:20:10,761
Richie!

1346
01:20:20,566 --> 01:20:22,079
Well, I have to say

1347
01:20:22,126 --> 01:20:25,004
he didn't look half bad
for a suicide.

1348
01:20:25,046 --> 01:20:28,197
Attempted, anyway.

1349
01:20:28,246 --> 01:20:29,679
Thanks.

1350
01:20:30,646 --> 01:20:32,523
Please

1351
01:20:32,566 --> 01:20:34,955
Give me second grace

1352
01:20:38,726 --> 01:20:40,557
Please

1353
01:20:40,606 --> 01:20:43,325
Give me a second face

1354
01:20:46,806 --> 01:20:49,957
I've fallen far down

1355
01:20:50,006 --> 01:20:53,999
The first time around

1356
01:20:54,046 --> 01:20:58,244
Now I just sit on the ground
in your way

1357
01:21:06,166 --> 01:21:08,999
Now

1358
01:21:09,046 --> 01:21:11,162
If it's time
for recompense

1359
01:21:11,206 --> 01:21:12,480
For what's done...

1360
01:21:12,526 --> 01:21:14,403
Who's there?

1361
01:21:14,446 --> 01:21:16,721
Come

1362
01:21:16,766 --> 01:21:19,838
Come sit down
on the fence in the sun...

1363
01:21:19,886 --> 01:21:21,239
Hello?

1364
01:21:22,246 --> 01:21:26,683
And the clouds will roll by

1365
01:21:26,726 --> 01:21:29,320
And we'll never deny...

1366
01:21:36,646 --> 01:21:39,956
W-What are you doing in my tent?

1367
01:21:40,006 --> 01:21:43,078
Just listening to some records.

1368
01:21:43,126 --> 01:21:45,765
Aren't you supposed to be
in the hospital?

1369
01:21:45,806 --> 01:21:47,876
I checked myself out.

1370
01:22:08,646 --> 01:22:12,355
How many stitches
did you get?

1371
01:22:12,406 --> 01:22:14,078
I don't know.

1372
01:22:14,126 --> 01:22:15,684
You want to see?

1373
01:22:17,686 --> 01:22:21,679
They seem to stay
for day after day

1374
01:22:21,726 --> 01:22:22,795
And won't disappear...

1375
01:22:22,846 --> 01:22:23,995
Jesus.

1376
01:22:24,046 --> 01:22:25,923
I tried every way...

1377
01:22:25,966 --> 01:22:29,800
Richie, that looks horrible.

1378
01:22:29,846 --> 01:22:33,316
I heard about your ex-husband.

1379
01:22:33,366 --> 01:22:34,355
Desmond?

1380
01:22:34,406 --> 01:22:35,395
I guess so.

1381
01:22:35,446 --> 01:22:37,243
I didn't get his name.

1382
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:38,514
Yeah.

1383
01:22:38,566 --> 01:22:40,875
I met him in the ocean.

1384
01:22:40,926 --> 01:22:42,075
I was swimming

1385
01:22:42,126 --> 01:22:44,879
and he came out to me
in a canoe.

1386
01:22:44,926 --> 01:22:46,996
We were only married
nine days.

1387
01:22:47,046 --> 01:22:48,764
And I heard about Eli.

1388
01:22:48,806 --> 01:22:49,955
I know.

1389
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:54,522
Poor Eli.

1390
01:22:54,566 --> 01:22:57,717
Anyway, we mostly
just talked about you.

1391
01:22:57,766 --> 01:23:00,405
You did?

1392
01:23:00,446 --> 01:23:03,119
Yeah.

1393
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:08,081
I guess that was the attraction,
if you know what I mean.

1394
01:23:08,126 --> 01:23:12,085
She smiled sweetly

1395
01:23:12,126 --> 01:23:15,038
She smiled sweetly

1396
01:23:15,086 --> 01:23:17,316
And says don't worry...

1397
01:23:17,366 --> 01:23:19,436
I have to tell you
something.

1398
01:23:19,486 --> 01:23:21,363
What's that?

1399
01:23:21,406 --> 01:23:23,920
I love you.

1400
01:23:27,486 --> 01:23:30,478
I love you, too.

1401
01:23:33,086 --> 01:23:36,761
There's no use tryin'

1402
01:23:36,806 --> 01:23:39,240
You're here

1403
01:23:39,286 --> 01:23:43,438
Begin again

1404
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:45,716
And o'er again

1405
01:23:47,766 --> 01:23:52,521
That's what she said
so softly...

1406
01:23:52,566 --> 01:23:55,080
I can't stop thin<u>ki</u>ng
about you.

1407
01:23:55,126 --> 01:23:58,243
I went away for a year,
and it only got worse

1408
01:23:58,286 --> 01:24:00,197
and I don't know
what to do.

1409
01:24:00,246 --> 01:24:04,125
Let's lie down
for a minute.

1410
01:24:08,406 --> 01:24:10,317
She smiled sweetly

1411
01:24:10,366 --> 01:24:12,641
She smiled sweetly...

1412
01:24:12,686 --> 01:24:14,756
This is
the sleeping bag

1413
01:24:14,806 --> 01:24:17,604
we took to the museum,
isn't it.

1414
01:24:17,646 --> 01:24:20,479
Mm-hmm.

1415
01:24:20,526 --> 01:24:22,756
Oh, no, no, no...

1416
01:24:22,806 --> 01:24:24,683
Why'd you do it?

1417
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,365
Because of me?

1418
01:24:27,406 --> 01:24:30,478
Yeah, but it's
not your fault.

1419
01:24:34,926 --> 01:24:38,555
You're not going
to do it again, are you?

1420
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:40,164
I doubt it.

1421
01:24:41,886 --> 01:24:44,525
She would never say

1422
01:24:44,566 --> 01:24:47,285
Where she came from...

1423
01:24:50,726 --> 01:24:54,116
Yesterday don't matter

1424
01:24:54,166 --> 01:24:56,316
If it's gone

1425
01:25:00,086 --> 01:25:01,963
While the sun is bright

1426
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:06,599
Or in the darkest night

1427
01:25:06,646 --> 01:25:08,364
No one knows...

1428
01:25:08,406 --> 01:25:10,158
I think we're just going
to have to be

1429
01:25:10,206 --> 01:25:11,798
secretly in love with each other

1430
01:25:11,846 --> 01:25:13,279
and leave it at that, Richie.

1431
01:25:17,526 --> 01:25:21,235
Good-bye, Ruby Tuesday

1432
01:25:21,286 --> 01:25:25,802
Who could hang a name
on you?

1433
01:25:25,846 --> 01:25:30,124
When you change
with every new day

1434
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:33,044
Still I'm gonna miss you...

1435
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,122
Lobby floor.

1436
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:39,121
Thank you, sir.

1437
01:25:44,886 --> 01:25:46,604
Going up?

1438
01:25:46,646 --> 01:25:47,840
Yeah.

1439
01:25:47,886 --> 01:25:49,160
What floor, sir?

1440
01:25:49,206 --> 01:25:51,117
Doesn't matter.

1441
01:25:58,726 --> 01:26:00,159
So, you're
elevator operators now?

1442
01:26:00,206 --> 01:26:01,321
Yeah, just started.

1443
01:26:01,366 --> 01:26:03,243
We'll get a bump as soon
as we join the union.

1444
01:26:04,846 --> 01:26:07,041
What made you decide
to do that?

1445
01:26:07,086 --> 01:26:08,678
We're broke.

1446
01:26:08,726 --> 01:26:11,718
But in answer to your question

1447
01:26:11,766 --> 01:26:12,755
I wanted to prove

1448
01:26:12,806 --> 01:26:14,239
I could pay my dues,
and whatnot.

1449
01:26:14,286 --> 01:26:17,642
I just hope
somebody notices.

1450
01:26:19,086 --> 01:26:23,045
You asked me
why I choked out there that day.

1451
01:26:23,086 --> 01:26:24,485
I think I may know
the answer

1452
01:26:24,526 --> 01:26:25,879
and I wanted your advice.

1453
01:26:26,886 --> 01:26:29,161
Sure.

1454
01:26:36,366 --> 01:26:37,879
Margot Tenenbaum?

1455
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:38,836
Yeah.

1456
01:26:38,886 --> 01:26:40,763
Well, since when?

1457
01:26:40,806 --> 01:26:43,479
Since always.

1458
01:26:43,526 --> 01:26:44,595
Does she know?

1459
01:26:44,646 --> 01:26:46,079
Uh-huh.

1460
01:26:46,126 --> 01:26:49,243
Well, what does she
feel about that?

1461
01:26:49,286 --> 01:26:50,844
I think
she feels confused.

1462
01:26:50,886 --> 01:26:51,955
Well, I can
understand that.

1463
01:26:52,006 --> 01:26:53,439
It's probably illegal.

1464
01:26:53,486 --> 01:26:54,760
I don't think so.

1465
01:26:54,806 --> 01:26:56,922
We're not related
by blood.

1466
01:26:56,966 --> 01:26:58,684
That's true.

1467
01:26:58,726 --> 01:27:00,762
Still frowned upon.

1468
01:27:00,806 --> 01:27:03,843
But then, what isn't
these days, right?

1469
01:27:12,806 --> 01:27:14,125
I don't know,
maybe it works.

1470
01:27:14,166 --> 01:27:15,281
Why not, what the hell.

1471
01:27:15,326 --> 01:27:16,759
You love each other.

1472
01:27:16,806 --> 01:27:19,764
Nobody knows what's
going to happen, so...

1473
01:27:19,806 --> 01:27:21,205
You know something.

1474
01:27:22,406 --> 01:27:24,874
Don't listen to me.

1475
01:27:24,926 --> 01:27:26,882
I never understood her myself.

1476
01:27:26,926 --> 01:27:28,837
I never understood any of us.

1477
01:27:28,886 --> 01:27:30,478
I wish I could
tell you what to do

1478
01:27:30,526 --> 01:27:32,596
but I just can't.

1479
01:27:33,766 --> 01:27:35,199
That's okay.

1480
01:27:35,246 --> 01:27:38,318
No, it's not.

1481
01:27:38,366 --> 01:27:41,563
You still consider me
your father?

1482
01:27:41,606 --> 01:27:45,042
Sure, I do.

1483
01:27:45,086 --> 01:27:48,715
I wish I had more to offer
in that department.

1484
01:27:48,766 --> 01:27:51,644
I know you do, Pop.

1485
01:27:57,246 --> 01:27:59,157
I don't blame you,
by the way.

1486
01:27:59,206 --> 01:28:01,356
Uh, she's a
great-loo<u>ki</u>ng girl

1487
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:02,805
and smart as a whip.

1488
01:28:02,846 --> 01:28:04,165
Mordecai.

1489
01:28:04,206 --> 01:28:11,715
Stephanie says
that she wants to know

1490
01:28:11,766 --> 01:28:16,078
Why she's given
half her life

1491
01:28:16,126 --> 01:28:20,165
To people she hates now...

1492
01:28:20,206 --> 01:28:22,276
Holy shit.

1493
01:28:22,326 --> 01:28:25,159
You came back.

1494
01:28:25,206 --> 01:28:26,321
Jiminy crickets.

1495
01:28:26,366 --> 01:28:29,517
That damn bird must
have radar in its brain.

1496
01:28:29,566 --> 01:28:30,760
Is that true, Mordecai?

1497
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,683
I-I'm not so sure
this is Mordecai.

1498
01:28:32,726 --> 01:28:33,795
What do you mean?

1499
01:28:33,846 --> 01:28:35,120
He flew right in here.

1500
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:37,396
This bird has much more
white feathers on him.

1501
01:28:39,966 --> 01:28:43,003
Oh, the son of a bitch
must be molting.

1502
01:28:43,046 --> 01:28:45,640
Oh. I need your help
with something else.

1503
01:28:45,686 --> 01:28:47,278
You got it.
What's the situation?

1504
01:28:47,326 --> 01:28:48,918
Well, um,
I think Eli maybe...

1505
01:28:48,966 --> 01:28:50,524
Hold it.

1506
01:28:50,566 --> 01:28:53,000
Pagoda, meet me
in the lobby.

1507
01:28:53,046 --> 01:28:54,274
Let's hit it.

1508
01:28:56,326 --> 01:28:59,363
I didn't mean
right this second,
but... that's okay.

1509
01:28:59,406 --> 01:29:01,966
I don't think
it was Ramses.

1510
01:29:02,006 --> 01:29:03,280
I believe
it was Tootinkamen.

1511
01:29:03,326 --> 01:29:04,395
Tutankhamen.

1512
01:29:04,446 --> 01:29:05,595
Tutankhamen?

1513
01:29:05,646 --> 01:29:06,761
Yes. Tutankhamen.

1514
01:29:11,406 --> 01:29:13,522
Yes?

1515
01:29:17,686 --> 01:29:19,597
Hey, Richie.

1516
01:29:26,806 --> 01:29:29,001
We want to take you
to get some help.

1517
01:29:30,886 --> 01:29:32,763
Is itjust you guys?

1518
01:29:32,806 --> 01:29:34,922
Would you

1519
01:29:34,966 --> 01:29:36,035
excuse us, please?

1520
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:40,397
Okay.

1521
01:29:48,606 --> 01:29:50,517
Are we still friends?

1522
01:29:52,326 --> 01:29:53,361
What do you mean?

1523
01:29:53,406 --> 01:29:54,475
Are we?

1524
01:29:54,526 --> 01:29:55,641
Of course.

1525
01:29:55,686 --> 01:29:57,563
How can you even
ask me that?

1526
01:29:57,606 --> 01:29:58,925
Well, it doesn't matter.

1527
01:29:58,966 --> 01:30:00,001
It doesn't matter?

1528
01:30:00,046 --> 01:30:01,161
It <i>does</i> matter.

1529
01:30:01,206 --> 01:30:03,436
I heard about you
and Margot.

1530
01:30:13,526 --> 01:30:14,720
I'm sorry.

1531
01:30:14,766 --> 01:30:15,960
I don't know
what to say.

1532
01:30:16,006 --> 01:30:17,883
You don't have
to say anything.

1533
01:30:17,926 --> 01:30:22,238
I always wanted
to be a Tenenbaum, you know.

1534
01:30:22,286 --> 01:30:23,685
Me, too.

1535
01:30:23,726 --> 01:30:24,841
Me, too.

1536
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:27,002
'Cause it
doesn't mean

1537
01:30:27,046 --> 01:30:29,719
what it used to
though, does it?

1538
01:30:29,766 --> 01:30:32,155
I wish he'd done this for me
when I was a <u>ki</u>d.

1539
01:30:34,286 --> 01:30:36,561
But you didn't have
a drug problem then.

1540
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:40,634
Yeah, but it would've
meant a lot to me.

1541
01:30:40,686 --> 01:30:42,597
Anyway, I'm glad
you're here now.

1542
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:45,956
I recognise
that I have a problem...

1543
01:30:46,006 --> 01:30:49,316
and I want
to get better.

1544
01:30:51,366 --> 01:30:53,277
I'll just grab my stuff.

1545
01:31:02,846 --> 01:31:04,757
There he goes.

1546
01:31:04,806 --> 01:31:06,080
What?!

1547
01:31:06,126 --> 01:31:07,036
There he goes.

1548
01:31:07,086 --> 01:31:08,360
Tucker!

1549
01:31:08,406 --> 01:31:10,044
S<u>ki</u>ddly, s<u>ki</u>ddly.

1550
01:31:16,646 --> 01:31:20,844
Christmastime is here

1551
01:31:20,886 --> 01:31:23,161
Happiness and cheer...

1552
01:31:23,206 --> 01:31:26,357
I'd like to order
some ice cream for
my daughter, please.

1553
01:31:26,406 --> 01:31:27,634
What would you like, Margot?

1554
01:31:27,686 --> 01:31:30,439
Nothing. I told you
I have to go in five minutes.

1555
01:31:30,486 --> 01:31:32,522
Oh.

1556
01:31:34,966 --> 01:31:37,639
I'll have a butterscotch sundae,
I guess.

1557
01:31:43,406 --> 01:31:46,045
Your brother's all torn up
inside.

1558
01:31:46,086 --> 01:31:49,123
Well, so am I, but I'm not going
to discuss it with you.

1559
01:31:50,686 --> 01:31:52,677
Oh...

1560
01:31:52,726 --> 01:31:54,603
Can't somebody be a shit
their whole life

1561
01:31:54,646 --> 01:31:55,874
and try to repair the damage?

1562
01:31:55,926 --> 01:31:59,236
I-I mean, I think people want
to hear that.

1563
01:31:59,286 --> 01:32:00,196
Do they?

1564
01:32:00,246 --> 01:32:01,122
Mmm.

1565
01:32:01,166 --> 01:32:02,997
You probably don't even know

1566
01:32:03,046 --> 01:32:04,957
my middle name.

1567
01:32:08,366 --> 01:32:10,721
That's a trick question.

1568
01:32:10,766 --> 01:32:12,085
You don't have one.

1569
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:13,320
Helen.

1570
01:32:13,366 --> 01:32:16,278
That was my mother's name.

1571
01:32:16,326 --> 01:32:19,159
I know it was.

1572
01:32:32,606 --> 01:32:35,074
Anybody interested
in grabbing a couple burgers

1573
01:32:35,126 --> 01:32:37,037
and hitting the cemetery?

1574
01:32:58,086 --> 01:33:00,236
I got something for you, Ethel.

1575
01:33:00,286 --> 01:33:01,685
Actually, I made it.

1576
01:33:01,726 --> 01:33:03,079
What's this?

1577
01:33:03,126 --> 01:33:04,275
It's a divorce.

1578
01:33:04,326 --> 01:33:06,044
From you?

1579
01:33:06,086 --> 01:33:07,155
Yes.

1580
01:33:07,206 --> 01:33:08,321
This is Sanchez.

1581
01:33:08,366 --> 01:33:09,435
He's a notary public.

1582
01:33:09,486 --> 01:33:10,555
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

1583
01:33:10,606 --> 01:33:11,721
You just sign here

1584
01:33:11,766 --> 01:33:13,836
and initial here
and sign there.

1585
01:33:16,166 --> 01:33:18,441
You own this building,
don't you, Henry?

1586
01:33:18,486 --> 01:33:20,442
Hmm.

1587
01:33:20,486 --> 01:33:23,046
It's magnificent.

1588
01:33:23,086 --> 01:33:24,917
I used to be a homeowner myself

1589
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:27,161
until our son expropriated it
from me.

1590
01:33:28,166 --> 01:33:29,485
I got to catch my bus.

1591
01:33:29,526 --> 01:33:30,561
Thanks, Sanchez.

1592
01:33:30,606 --> 01:33:31,721
You're welcome.

1593
01:33:31,766 --> 01:33:33,643
Are we divorced?

1594
01:33:33,686 --> 01:33:34,755
Almost.

1595
01:33:34,806 --> 01:33:36,956
Sanchez just has
to file the papers.

1596
01:33:37,006 --> 01:33:38,359
I love you, Etheline.

1597
01:33:38,406 --> 01:33:40,920
Congratulations
to both of you.

1598
01:33:40,966 --> 01:33:42,843
I didn't think so much
of him at first.

1599
01:33:42,886 --> 01:33:44,001
But now I get it.

1600
01:33:44,046 --> 01:33:45,957
He's everything that I'm not.

1601
01:33:50,046 --> 01:33:52,640
Take back Pagoda, will you?

1602
01:34:24,966 --> 01:34:26,365
Uh, slightly uneven.

1603
01:34:26,406 --> 01:34:29,239
Looks okay.
You're just nervous.

1604
01:34:29,286 --> 01:34:31,083
Henry?

1605
01:34:31,126 --> 01:34:32,161
Hello, Richie.

1606
01:34:32,206 --> 01:34:33,355
Hi.

1607
01:34:33,406 --> 01:34:35,317
This is my son, Walter Sherman.

1608
01:34:35,366 --> 01:34:38,039
Hi, Walter.
Nice to meet you.

1609
01:34:38,086 --> 01:34:39,235
Nice to meet you.

1610
01:34:39,286 --> 01:34:40,435
Henry's your dad?

1611
01:34:40,486 --> 01:34:42,761
Yes.

1612
01:34:42,806 --> 01:34:44,717
So you've been
married before.

1613
01:34:44,766 --> 01:34:47,485
Yes. I'm a widower.

1614
01:34:47,526 --> 01:34:49,437
Oh, yeah.

1615
01:34:49,486 --> 01:34:51,920
I forgot.

1616
01:34:54,286 --> 01:34:57,005
You know, I'm a
widower myself.

1617
01:34:59,886 --> 01:35:02,446
I know you are, Chas.

1618
01:35:05,086 --> 01:35:07,281
What are you chewing on?

1619
01:35:07,326 --> 01:35:08,884
My nicotine inhaler.

1620
01:35:08,926 --> 01:35:10,803
It's supposed
to help me quit.

1621
01:35:10,846 --> 01:35:13,314
Is it wor<u>ki</u>ng?

1622
01:35:13,366 --> 01:35:16,119
Not really.

1623
01:35:19,566 --> 01:35:21,238
Well, of course,
I'm half Hebrew

1624
01:35:21,286 --> 01:35:23,720
but the children are
three-quarters Mick Catholic.

1625
01:35:23,766 --> 01:35:25,836
So they were raised
in the church?

1626
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:27,842
I believe so.

1627
01:35:27,886 --> 01:35:29,683
I really don't know.

1628
01:35:39,046 --> 01:35:41,082
Here I come.

1629
01:35:44,366 --> 01:35:45,799
Boys!

1630
01:35:47,286 --> 01:35:48,878
What was that?

1631
01:35:50,126 --> 01:35:52,276
Eli just crashed his car
into the front of the house.

1632
01:35:52,326 --> 01:35:53,554
Oh, my God.

1633
01:36:03,406 --> 01:36:05,681
Where's my shoe?

1634
01:36:08,646 --> 01:36:10,716
Ari, Uzi, where are you?

1635
01:36:10,766 --> 01:36:11,994
They're okay, Chas.

1636
01:36:12,046 --> 01:36:13,274
It's okay.
They're safe.

1637
01:36:13,326 --> 01:36:14,679
They're safe.

1638
01:36:14,726 --> 01:36:15,795
Dad, they ran
over Buckley.

1639
01:36:15,846 --> 01:36:16,756
What?

1640
01:36:16,806 --> 01:36:18,398
Yeah, I think
we lost Buckley.

1641
01:36:18,446 --> 01:36:19,561
He saved them.

1642
01:36:19,606 --> 01:36:20,721
Who?

1643
01:36:20,766 --> 01:36:22,643
Dad. He pulled them
out of the way.

1644
01:36:22,686 --> 01:36:24,597
You did?

1645
01:36:25,886 --> 01:36:27,399
Did I hit anyone?

1646
01:36:27,446 --> 01:36:30,279
Is everybody okay?

1647
01:36:37,526 --> 01:36:39,437
Eli!

1648
01:36:39,486 --> 01:36:40,635
What's going on?

1649
01:36:49,086 --> 01:36:51,316
Eli!

1650
01:36:51,366 --> 01:36:53,277
What?

1651
01:36:54,486 --> 01:36:55,919
Hey, man.

1652
01:36:55,966 --> 01:36:57,763
You should try this.
It's very tasty.

1653
01:37:18,006 --> 01:37:19,359
Tenenbaum!

1654
01:37:21,486 --> 01:37:23,397
Chas?

1655
01:37:46,766 --> 01:37:48,757
Did I hit the dog?

1656
01:37:48,806 --> 01:37:50,717
Yeah.

1657
01:37:53,406 --> 01:37:55,397
Is he dead?

1658
01:37:55,446 --> 01:37:57,437
Yeah.

1659
01:38:00,566 --> 01:38:02,477
I need help.

1660
01:38:02,526 --> 01:38:05,882
So do I.

1661
01:38:10,686 --> 01:38:13,325
Go around to the other side.

1662
01:38:13,366 --> 01:38:14,640
You <u>ki</u>ds stay there.

1663
01:38:14,686 --> 01:38:15,755
We'll be right back.

1664
01:38:15,806 --> 01:38:17,717
Yeah.

1665
01:38:19,406 --> 01:38:20,919
Can I say something
to you, Henry?

1666
01:38:20,966 --> 01:38:22,081
Okay.

1667
01:38:22,126 --> 01:38:23,639
I've always been considered
an asshole

1668
01:38:23,686 --> 01:38:25,165
for about as long
as I can remember.

1669
01:38:25,206 --> 01:38:26,525
That's just my style.

1670
01:38:26,566 --> 01:38:27,601
But I'd really feel blue

1671
01:38:27,646 --> 01:38:29,682
if I didn't think
you were going to forgive me.

1672
01:38:29,726 --> 01:38:32,923
I don't think you're
an asshole, Royal.

1673
01:38:32,966 --> 01:38:35,685
I just think you're <u>ki</u>nd
of a son of a bitch.

1674
01:38:35,726 --> 01:38:39,560
Well, I really
appreciate that.

1675
01:38:39,606 --> 01:38:41,961
Could you let us
in your backyard, ma'am?

1676
01:38:42,006 --> 01:38:43,997
We've got a couple boys
back there.

1677
01:38:44,046 --> 01:38:46,002
I think you may
have broken an ankle.

1678
01:38:46,046 --> 01:38:48,640
Well, that's not terribly
serious, is it?

1679
01:38:48,686 --> 01:38:50,916
Do you have an alternate?

1680
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:52,160
No.

1681
01:38:52,206 --> 01:38:53,719
Ready?

1682
01:38:53,766 --> 01:38:55,597
Are there priests
on call?

1683
01:38:55,646 --> 01:38:57,637
Why don't you bring
the car around, Anwar.

1684
01:38:57,686 --> 01:39:00,837
At which point, I apparently
lost control of the vehicle

1685
01:39:00,886 --> 01:39:03,525
smashed it into the house,
and <u>ki</u>lled that poor dog.

1686
01:39:03,566 --> 01:39:05,158
You're Eli Cash.

1687
01:39:05,206 --> 01:39:06,764
Yes indeed, I am.

1688
01:39:06,806 --> 01:39:08,159
I love your work.

1689
01:39:08,206 --> 01:39:09,924
Oh, how sweet of you
to say.

1690
01:39:09,966 --> 01:39:11,718
78-35, Code Six.

1691
01:39:11,766 --> 01:39:13,597
105 North Sandler...

1692
01:39:13,646 --> 01:39:15,796
I think he's
part mutt.

1693
01:39:15,846 --> 01:39:19,282
What <u>ki</u>nd of
papers do you
have for him?

1694
01:39:19,326 --> 01:39:21,442
Spark Plug,
sit, sit.

1695
01:39:21,486 --> 01:39:23,954
Good boy.

1696
01:39:26,406 --> 01:39:29,398
Put this on.

1697
01:39:31,326 --> 01:39:32,475
What's so funny, Dudley?

1698
01:39:32,526 --> 01:39:34,437
You look great.

1699
01:39:35,966 --> 01:39:37,479
Can you see
out of it?

1700
01:39:37,526 --> 01:39:38,595
Not really.

1701
01:39:38,646 --> 01:39:40,716
Uh-huh. Minor
corneal damage.

1702
01:39:40,766 --> 01:39:43,200
Page me if it spreads
to the other eye.

1703
01:39:43,246 --> 01:39:45,316
Who do I make it out to?

1704
01:39:45,366 --> 01:39:47,084
Alex? Okay.

1705
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:50,841
But these aren't structure-
bearing elements, Dad.

1706
01:39:50,886 --> 01:39:52,239
It doesn't matter.

1707
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:54,038
It's still best
to file another
force majeure

1708
01:39:54,086 --> 01:39:55,360
and recoup
the deductible.

1709
01:40:00,366 --> 01:40:02,516
You boys come up here
with me.

1710
01:40:02,566 --> 01:40:04,477
But Buckley's
still under there.

1711
01:40:04,526 --> 01:40:09,281
I know, but there's nothing
we can do for him at the moment.

1712
01:40:09,326 --> 01:40:11,237
Come on.

1713
01:40:14,566 --> 01:40:16,921
I got you a new dog
for the boys.

1714
01:40:16,966 --> 01:40:18,843
I just bought him.

1715
01:40:18,886 --> 01:40:20,956
You did?

1716
01:40:21,006 --> 01:40:23,156
Sorry I let you down, Chas.

1717
01:40:23,206 --> 01:40:25,117
All of you.

1718
01:40:25,166 --> 01:40:27,680
I been trying
to make it up to you.

1719
01:40:33,846 --> 01:40:35,802
What's his name?

1720
01:40:35,846 --> 01:40:37,757
Spark Plug.

1721
01:40:40,526 --> 01:40:42,357
Thank you.

1722
01:40:42,406 --> 01:40:44,442
You're welcome.

1723
01:40:46,926 --> 01:40:48,882
I've had a
rough year, Dad.

1724
01:40:48,926 --> 01:40:51,076
I know you have, Chassie.

1725
01:40:57,926 --> 01:40:59,837
Hey.

1726
01:41:19,606 --> 01:41:20,834
See, now he has

1727
01:41:20,886 --> 01:41:22,683
more white feathers
on his neck.

1728
01:41:25,406 --> 01:41:27,715
I wonder
what happened to him?

1729
01:41:27,766 --> 01:41:29,279
I don't know.

1730
01:41:29,326 --> 01:41:32,238
Sometimes if a person
has a traumatic experience

1731
01:41:32,286 --> 01:41:33,719
their hair turns white.

1732
01:41:35,286 --> 01:41:37,481
Well, I'm sure
he'll get over it.

1733
01:41:53,366 --> 01:41:56,324
This was one
of my first hiding places.

1734
01:41:59,726 --> 01:42:01,876
How old do you
think those are?

1735
01:42:03,686 --> 01:42:05,563
I'd say about ten years.

1736
01:42:07,926 --> 01:42:09,803

01:45:50,046 --> 01:45:54,676
Down the avenue

1784
01:45:54,726 --> 01:45:59,038
Just like we used to

1785
01:45:59,086 --> 01:46:03,443
With our heads so high

1786
01:46:03,486 --> 01:46:07,877
Smile at passersby

1787
01:46:07,926 --> 01:46:12,397
And we'll softly sigh

1788
01:46:12,446 --> 01:46:16,644
Ai-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi

1789
01:46:16,686 --> 01:46:20,964
Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone

1790
01:46:21,006 --> 01:46:26,717
Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone

1791
01:46:28,406 --> 01:46:33,241
By the winding stream

1792
01:46:33,286 --> 01:46:37,518
We shall lay and dream

1793
01:46:37,566 --> 01:46:41,878
And these dreams come true

1794
01:46:41,926 --> 01:46:46,238
If we want them to

1795
01:46:46,286 --> 01:46:50,598
Yes, all will come

1796
01:46:50,646 --> 01:46:55,003
Playing pipes and drum

1797
01:46:55,046 --> 01:46:59,324
Sing a happy song

1798
01:46:59,366 --> 01:47:03,598
Yeah, we'll sing along

1799
01:47:03,646 --> 01:47:07,924
Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone

1800
01:47:07,966 --> 01:47:13,438
Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone

1801
01:47:44,606 --> 01:47:49,475
We shall walk again

1802
01:47:49,526 --> 01:47:54,156
All along down the lane

1803
01:47:54,206 --> 01:47:58,165
Down the avenue

1804
01:47:58,206 --> 01:48:02,916
Just like we used to

1805
01:48:02,966 --> 01:48:07,039
With our heads so high

1806
01:48:07,086 --> 01:48:11,477
Smile at passersby

1807
01:48:11,526 --> 01:48:15,883
And we'll softly sigh

1808
01:48:15,926 --> 01:48:19,999
Ai-yi-yi-yi-
yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi

1809
01:48:20,046 --> 01:48:24,437
Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone

1810
01:48:24,486 --> 01:48:30,163
Everyone, everyone,
everyone, everyone

1811
01:48:45,006 --> 01:48:49,716
Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah.
