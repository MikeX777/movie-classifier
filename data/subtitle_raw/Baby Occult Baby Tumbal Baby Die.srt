1
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,320
Good afternoon.

2
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,440
Good afternoon.

3
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,800
The victim is upstairs,
Commander. Please. This way.

4
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,000
Flashlight.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,200
Watch out, sir.
Blood.

6
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,760
Can I see him?
- Yes, sir.

7
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,080
Yes.

8
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,320
How can he be like this?
- The victim's bones are shattered.

9
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,600
What's wrong, miss?

10
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
What's going on?

11
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,640
Baby sacrifice.

12
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,120
Dead baby.

13
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,400
Dead husband.

14
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,600
Calm down.

15
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,120
I'll take you to a safe place.

16
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,360
Come on.

17
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,960
Oh God!

18
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,640
Didn't you.....
- No!

19
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,280
No, you did.
I remember. You did.

20
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,000
No, it was one class.
- No.

21
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,440
I don't have the talent.
- No. You're better.

22
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,840
You did more. Not just one class.
- No.

23
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,000
I've never seen. I should.
- No! We're not doing it.

24
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,560
You're embarrassing me
in front of all the people here.

25
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,480
Excuse me.
- Please.

26
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,080
Thank you.

27
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,440
Is this you?
- You know.

28
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,000
Shall I pour this?
- Please. Thank you.

29
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,080
Thank you.

30
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,400
Enjoy your drink.
- Thank you.

31
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,560
That's enough.
- Enjoy your drink.

32
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
Yeah.
- Thank you.

33
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,280
I have a surprise for you.

34
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,640
Wait. I got something for you.
- What?

35
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,960
Oh, my gosh!

36
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,960
I love it. Thank you.

37
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,040
Let me put it on you.
- Okay.

38
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,000
Can you open it?
- Yes. There we go.

39
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,560
Thank you.

40
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,320
Happy anniversary.

41
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,400
Cheers.
- Happy anniversary.

42
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,080
Why aren't you drinking it?

43
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,080
No.
- Wait a minute.

44
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,360
It's the one you like, right?
- Yes, the usual.

45
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,440
Hold on. Maybe there's another.
- No.

46
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,520
No, you're not wrong.
- I'll get you the other one.

47
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,160
Then why aren't you drinking?
- Yeah, it's okay.

48
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,240
You don't feel well?
- No.

49
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,640
Why? What's wrong?

50
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,480
I'm pregnant.

51
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,120
We're going to have a baby.

52
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,920
You're pregnant?

53
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes.
- A baby.

54
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,880
I'm going to be a dad.
- Yes.

55
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,760
I'm going to be a dad!

56
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,240
High five!
- Sorry.

57
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,440
Sorry.

58
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,360
I'm so happy
I could die right now.

59
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,800
Okay.

60
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Firstly, I want
to thank everybody...

61
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,080
...who joined
this construction bidding.

62
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,240
As we agreed,...

63
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,320
...the announcement of the winner
of construction project bidding...

64
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,480
...is done openly.

65
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,360
Okay. I'll read the announcement.

66
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,520
The winner of this
construction project bidding...

67
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:39,400
...is Rafa Green Construction,
led by Mr. Rafa.

68
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,720
Hold on, wait.
Is that right?

69
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,400
Congrats, Mr. Rafa.

70
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,400
Thank you for your trust.

71
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,840
We won't disappoint you.
Thank you again.

72
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes.

73
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,240
Mr. Ronald, don't be disappointed.

74
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,040
Thank you. Good morning.
- Thank you.

75
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,880
I was sure that we would win.
- We have to celebrate this.

76
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,120
We win this fair and square,
unlike the one behind me.

77
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,840
What do you mean?

78
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,080
Ronald, we won this fairly.

79
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,240
So we don't have problem with you.
See you on the next project, okay?

80
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,640
So, you were intentionally
looking for trouble with me, right?

81
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,720
Ronald.

82
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,760
Okay. Rafa, I pray you'll still
be alive to finish this project.

83
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,200
Ronald, are you threatening me?

84
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,160
Threatening?
- You just threatened me.

85
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,080
Listen, I was
just praying for you...

86
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,800
...to have a long life and be
healthy to finish this project.

87
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,440
Let it be.
- What?

88
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,520
He can't be like that.

89
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,040
Just because he lost this tender.
It's a habit already.

90
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,560
Sir, congratulations.
- Yes. Good job. Come on.

91
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,480
Sir.
- Hello.

92
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,160
You're late again,
Mr. Rubber Watch.

93
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,040
You're right.

94
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,040
Buy a proper watch.
- Buy for me.

95
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,800
As if you can't buy one yourself.
- I can. Sir.

96
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,480
Excuse me.
- Please.

97
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,960
Okay. Like the usual.
It's still thin, so just trim it.

98
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,040
Okay.
- Raf, to buy a watch,...

99
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,200
...we have to know ourselves,
our personality.

100
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,600
It has to suit our characteristic.

101
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,680
That's what important.
- You have too many excuses.

102
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,320
It's just a watch,
you're not buying a girlfriend.

103
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,440
See, he's talking about girls
just because I'm single. Fine.

104
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,040
One more thing, you're in
charge of the office tomorrow.

105
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm moving tomorrow.
- That's right. New house!

106
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,840
That's right. Nice!

107
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,800
Don't forget
the house cleansing ritual.

108
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,440
Later. I'm very busy right now.

109
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,760
This project has just started,
and there are also other projects.

110
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,920
One more thing.
Farah is pregnant, man!

111
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,800
Pregnant?
- Yes.

112
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,680
Wow, you must be happy. Congrats.
- Thanks.

113
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,040
Still, you must do
a cleansing ritual for the house.

114
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,520
To protect you from danger
and bless your house.

115
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,120
Do you want me to help you?

116
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,960
Yeah. If you want to help,
just help me find a maid.

117
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,720
You know someone who owns
a helper institution, right?

118
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,240
Yeah. I'll help you find one.

119
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,960
I'll ask my friend
who owns the institution.

120
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,680
Okay. Thanks, bro.

121
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,840
Okay. Wait.
- It's okay. I can do it myself.

122
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,240
Let me help you.
- I can do it.

123
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,480
My goodness.
- Hold on.

124
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,920
You're so pretty.
- How about the luggages?

125
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,080
I'll get that later.
Let's go in first.

126
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,080
My dear?

127
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,800
Come on.
- Okay.

128
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,960
Okay.

129
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,240
How about this? I asked them to put
the piano here. It's okay, right?

130
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,800
Yes.
- It's okay, right? The sofa?

131
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,760
Not there.
- Maybe here, but it's up to you.

132
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,360
Where do you want it?
- Move it over there.

133
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,000
I'll move it there, okay?
- Yes.

134
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,080
That would be here,
but I want to have one thing,...

135
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,360
...I want my work desk
to be placed here, okay?

136
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,120
So I can do my work
while looking at the scenery.

137
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,040
Thank you. I'm so happy.

138
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,200
Yes.

139
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,120
Done?
- It's working.

140
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,880
Let's start.

141
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,560
My dear?
- Yes.

142
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Our two- year wait
has finally been answered.

143
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,080
Thanks.

144
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,640
I vow to be by your side
for eternity.

145
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,680
I will protect you forever.

146
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,520
From anything?
- From anything.

147
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,400
Really?
- Yeah.

148
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,840
Yesterday, Ronald threatened me
just because he lost the tender.

149
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,120
Just ignore it,
he can't hurt me.

150
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,040
What if he decides
to do something?

151
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,640
I can do Krav Maga.

152
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,480
I can fight him.

153
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,680
What if he uses a pistol?
- I catch the bullet.

154
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,520
Then I'll throw it back to him.

155
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,600
What if he uses black magic?

156
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,440
Witchcraft?

157
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,920
Do you believe in those things?
- It could happen.

158
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,720
Come on.

159
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,800
Think wisely.

160
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,280
If witchcraft exists,...

161
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,360
...why didn't we use it
on our invaders during the war?

162
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,800
We wouldn't have to face the war
for 350 years, right?

163
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,240
Come on, don't think
about such things.

164
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,640
Edi. Hello, Edi.

165
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,080
Edi, how about tomorrow?
I'm at the new house.

166
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,040
Okay? Bye. Thank you.

167
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,080
Babe?
- Yes?

168
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,960
I want to tell you something.
- What is it?

169
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,920
It's about my past.

170
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,480
Your past?

171
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,000
If you want to do that,
you can't expect me to do it too.

172
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
You'd be confused
if I were to tell you everything.

173
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,520
What I mean is.....

174
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,800
Come on.
Everyone has a past,...

175
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,320
...but that's not important to me.

176
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,720
I don't want to know your past.

177
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,600
I just want a future with you.

178
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,720
All the important things in my
life are in this room right now.

179
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,320
So, let's forget about the past
and focus on the future. Okay?

180
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,400
All right? Okay.

181
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,360
Listen here.

182
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,320
I don't want to fail again.

183
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,640
What happened yesterday
was because we didn't use...

184
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,440
...the usual method.

185
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,280
Rafa,...

186
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,520
...he has to pay
for what happened yesterday.

187
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,280
What's wrong, babe?

188
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,600
I had a nightmare
that all my teeth fell out.

189
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,240
It felt so vivid and real.

190
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,720
It is said that is an omen...

191
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,560
...that someone close
to you will die.

192
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,120
Just forget it.
It was just a dream.

193
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,440
I'm so sleepy.
Don't wake me up again.

194
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,200
You're still not feeling well?
- Yes.

195
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,240
In the late stages of pregnancy,
sometimes it's hard to sleep.

196
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,600
It's okay. There you go.
- Okay.

197
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,920
My tummy feels so heavy.

198
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,520
Well, there's a baby inside it.

199
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,280
If it's light, then we
have to be suspicious. Right?

200
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,760
Coffee.
- Thank you, darling.

201
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,960
Here.
- Thanks, darling.

202
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,320
You're eating steak in the morning?
- I'm craving for it.

203
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,920
Why is the steak so raw?

204
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,760
I like it rare.
This is delicious.

205
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,560
It's not rare. This is raw.
- It's the baby who wants it.

206
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,160
Dear?

207
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,560
No.

208
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,240
Pregnant women aren't allowed
to eat raw meat like this.

209
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,360
This is not healthy for you,
nor the baby. It's dangerous.

210
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,120
It's fine if you want steak,
but you have to make it well done.

211
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,200
You can't eat it like this.

212
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,600
Here you go.

213
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,760
Make yourself a new one.

214
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,240
Okay, I got to go to the office.

215
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,040
I'll pick something up on the way.
Okay? I'll see you.

216
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,720
All right?

217
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,360
Wake up.
- What's wrong, darling?

218
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,280
There.....
- Why, darling?

219
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,640
There was an old lady over there.
She held my stomach.

220
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,560
You were just dreaming.
Come on, let's go back to sleep.

221
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,920
Dear.
- Yes?

222
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,440
It was so weird,
I saw some kind of hand in there.

223
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,160
You're just tired.

224
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,600
I told you,
you should just rest today.

225
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,800
Don't force yourself
to go for a doctor's visit.

226
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,520
I've told you,
I can't accompany you today.

227
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,600
I have to go to work,
I have a project.

228
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,760
Yes, but it's scheduled for today.
I can go by myself.

229
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay, I'll call Edi and tell him
that I can't work this morning...

230
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,320
...and I'll accompany you, okay?
- Why would you do that? Just go.

231
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,000
I can go by myself.
- I know you can, darling,...

232
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,560
...but I don't want you to.
I want to be there for you.

233
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm not asking you to do that.
What's the big deal?

234
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,520
Then how will you come back here?
You don't know the way here.

235
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,920
I have GPS.

236
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,200
Okay. Okay, fine.

237
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,880
Tell me the result, okay?

238
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm going now.

239
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,160
Okay, thank you.

240
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,720
Raf. Come on. Are we going now?
- Edi. Yes, but wait. I.....

241
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,800
What?
- I want to ask you something.

242
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,240
I don't know why,
but lately my wife's a bit.....

243
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,560
A bit exaggerating.

244
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,800
What do you mean?

245
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,240
I don't know, but.....

246
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,080
This is one example.

247
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,680
Yesterday, she wanted to eat steak
in the morning. That's fine.

248
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,160
She wanted to eat it very rare.

249
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,600
At night, she wakes up screaming
as if she had a nightmare.

250
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,440
I don't know what's going on.

251
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,800
It's a bit strange, but.....

252
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,520
Maybe it's a hormonal issue.
That's common.

253
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,880
Maybe it's been a while
since you two, you know?

254
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,160
What are you talking about?
She's in her late pregnancy stage.

255
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,040
You're so weird.
- I don't know these things.

256
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,400
No wonder you're still single.
You're crazy!

257
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,360
By the way,
did you get a maid yet?

258
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,360
Not yet.
It's so hard to find one.

259
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,440
Most of them just stay for a
while and then they would leave.

260
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,160
Didn't you say
that you wanted to help me?

261
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,360
Yes.
- You know someone, right?

262
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,240
Yeah, but I don't know what kind
of maid you two were looking for.

263
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,280
Do you want a young one,
a pretty one, or a sexy one?

264
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,920
Of course not!
- So you want an old one?

265
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,160
You're a changed man, is that it?
Is it because your wife is pretty?

266
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,080
It's not a case of old or young.

267
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,920
I want someone who is diligent
and competent at her job.

268
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,640
Usually the old ones
are like that.

269
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,880
The young ones don't come back.
- Relax.

270
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,600
Help me find one.
- I'll ask my friend. Let's go.

271
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,520
You go first. I'll catch up.
I have some business with Evelyn.

272
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,160
Okay.
- All right?

273
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,800
Evelyn, is it done? Let me see.
All right?

274
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,640
Bye.
- Okay.

275
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,880
Check it.
- Okay.

276
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,240
Yes. It suits him. Good job.

277
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,000
Mrs. Farah, do you have
any concerns lately?

278
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,040
I have a meat craving, doctor.

279
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,160
Also, my tummy feels heavy.
That's normal, right?

280
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,360
Meat craving?
- Yes. Steak.

281
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,600
Steak?

282
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,560
Okay, as long as
it's not too much.

283
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,320
There are many types of cravings.

284
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,880
If it's big and heavy,
that means the fetus is healthy.

285
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,040
Excuse me, doctor.
- Right.

286
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,160
Hold on.

287
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,880
Mrs. Farah, do you want to know
if it's a boy or a girl?

288
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,320
Yes.

289
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,160
Good afternoon.
- Afternoon, sir.

290
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,920
Good afternoon. It's a boy!

291
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,400
Now you want a male maid,
you said you wanted a female one.

292
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,960
Not that. My wife called.
She was at the doctor.

293
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,840
My baby is a boy.

294
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,400
It's a boy?
- Yes.

295
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,400
Congrats, man. Happy for you.
- Yes.

296
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,440
I'm so jealous of you.

297
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,040
Your wife is pretty and thoughtful
and now you're having a boy.

298
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,960
I think, if you're not around,...

299
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,800
...I'm the most suitable man
to accompany Farah.

300
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,400
Come on!

301
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Why are you here?
Go be with Farah!

302
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,600
I want to but.....

303
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,280
It's a long story, bro.

304
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,040
Anyway, we have a lot of work.
- Forget this.

305
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,560
Let me finish this today.
Go be with Farah. Seriously.

306
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,440
Let me tell you.
It's just the living room.

307
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,480
I was right to bring you this.
- Look, this is just.....

308
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,960
What's this?
- It's for you, bro.

309
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,920
Rolex?

310
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,040
Seriously? For me?

311
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,680
Oh, man! Seriously?

312
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,400
It's crazy! Thank you, man.

313
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,840
Just consider this
as a token of our friendship.

314
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,440
You have helped me
get this project.

315
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,720
You help me on site,
and at the office, everyday.

316
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,320
Hey, come on.
- I can't trust anyone else.

317
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,600
Thank you so much.
- I really appreciate it.

318
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,560
Me too. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

319
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,560
So, how is it?
- Hold on. I'll surely wear it.

320
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,480
Don't be late again.

321
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,560
My dear!

322
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,800
Darling!

323
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,120
No signal!

324
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,240
Hey, darling.

325
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,760
Darling.

326
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,360
Help!

327
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,920
Help!

328
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,640
Help!

329
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,680
Help me, sir!

330
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,520
Oh, God. What's going on?
- Let's help.

331
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,320
Help.
- What happened?

332
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,800
Your stomach is so tense now.
We'll help you deliver it now.

333
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:41,600
No. Take me home. Help me.
- Come on. Put her in the car.

334
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,760
How about our motorcycle?
- Just lock it first.

335
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,200
Come on, ma'am. Slowly.

336
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,240
Slowly.

337
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,200
Where's the baby?

338
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:42,080
Our baby is being cleaned
by Miss Siti.

339
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,560
Sir, ma'am, I've cleaned the baby.

340
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,040
Bring him here.

341
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,160
Excuse me.
- Thank you.

342
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,640
Rangga.

343
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,440
Rangga, sweetie.

344
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,040
Let me play a song
for you to fall asleep.

345
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,560
Dear.
- Hey, darling.

346
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,880
I have something for you.

347
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,560
Darling?

348
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,040
Open it.

349
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,640
There are three of us now.
You have to be tough.

350
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,760
Yeah.

351
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,600
Ouch!

352
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,600
Rangga, what's wrong with you?

353
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,880
Rangga?

354
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,960
Dear!
- What's wrong?

355
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,840
The baby. His eyes.....

356
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,640
What?
- His eyes are like fire.

357
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,200
Hold on. His eyes are like fire?
- Yes, his eyes are like fire.

358
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,840
Okay. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

359
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,640
Relax. Take a deep breath.

360
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,520
Just look at him.
- Wait. Think about it.

361
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,520
It's a baby.
It doesn't make sense.

362
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,840
Yeah, but.....

363
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,840
Maybe it was the reflection
from a car's headlight outside.

364
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,760
Maybe light reflected in his eyes.
- No.

365
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,960
It doesn't make sense.
- Just look at him. Come on.

366
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,600
Let's look at the CCTV.
Okay? Come here.

367
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,760
Come on.

368
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,320
Just now, right? Okay.

369
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,040
Okay, play.

370
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,040
Look. It's you.

371
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,440
You were shocked, right?

372
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,520
Now, let's pause.
Look at the baby.

373
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,640
Look at him.

374
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,480
Nothing, right?
Let's watch it again.

375
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,200
There.

376
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,160
Wait.

377
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,360
What's wrong with it?
- What's wrong with this thing?

378
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,720
It was just installed.
Maybe the connection. Hold on.

379
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,280
Look at it again.
- It's okay now. Look. You ran out.

380
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,480
This is now. This is live.

381
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,480
Look at the baby.

382
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,680
Rangga's fine.
There's no problem.

383
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,760
This is my friend's house.
- Edi.

384
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,880
Hey, Raf.
Why are you so disheveled?

385
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,600
I'll tell you later.
- Anyway, as I promised.

386
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,600
This is Mbok Wati,
from my friend's institution.

387
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,920
This is just the right time.
Mbok Wati, please come in.

388
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,400
There's a room on the left.
- Thank you, sir.

389
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,560
Please, that way.
- Has it started for a while?

390
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,560
It's just started. Come on.

391
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,320
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

392
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,080
Okay. Let's start.
- Yes.

393
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,920
Please.

394
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,880
Sorry, sir. There's a difficulty.

395
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,080
What do you mean?

396
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,160
It's not working.

397
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,480
Hey, Edi. What are you doing?
- Hey, Raf.

398
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,400
I have to take
some time off next week.

399
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,920
We are very busy now.
- Listen to me.

400
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,000
Who knows, right?
This girl might be my soulmate.

401
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,800
Soulmate? Seriously?
- I have this girl.....

402
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,360
Just pray for me.
- When these two are together,...

403
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,880
...be it at home or at the office,
they can't be separated.

404
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,720
He's gossiping.
- Come in. It's started.

405
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,720
Okay.
- Come in. What did you cook?

406
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,840
<i>"Baby Blues" is a mood disorder</i>
<i>to mothers after giving birth.</i>

407
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,280
Sir, this house is occupied.

408
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,280
Yes. Me, my wife,
and my son. What's the matter?

409
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,880
This house is haunted, sir.

410
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,280
You believe in shaman?

411
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,240
Please, come in.

412
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,000
This is a new house, right?

413
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,160
Has it been cleansed?

414
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,760
It has, just several days ago.

415
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,600
It's weird.

416
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,240
It should have been safe by now.

417
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,240
Wait, where did
the cleansing take place?

418
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:35,040
As usual, in the living room
and in the middle room.

419
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,320
Where did you get disturbed?

420
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,400
When it happened yesterday,...

421
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,280
...I was cleaning the bathroom.

422
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,480
Then, when I was
cleaning the toilet,...

423
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,720
...a hand came out,...

424
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,160
...and then it was gone.

425
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,480
Has the bathroom been cleansed?

426
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,440
It has, using carbolic acid.

427
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,560
Where's the bathroom?
Let me clean it.

428
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,160
It's up there, sir. Follow me.

429
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,320
Ma'am. Sir, this is
the owner of the house.

430
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,160
I'm Farah.
Thank you for helping us.

431
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,920
I need to check this room.

432
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:58,720
Please, but my son is sleeping.
Is that okay?

433
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,400
It's okay. Excuse me.
- Yes, thank you.

434
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:07,080
Did he check downstairs?
- Yes. He's checked everywhere.

435
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,040
There is
something unnatural with.....

436
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,560
With what?

437
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,400
You should all
get out of this place.

438
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,400
What do you mean?
- Your fee, sir.

439
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,200
Mbok?

440
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,880
From tomorrow onwards,...

441
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:29,560
...nobody can
get in my way anymore.

442
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,680
Rafa!

443
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,360
Help!

444
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,800
Rafa!

445
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,360
What's wrong?
- There's a demon.

446
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,480
His face was all black just now.

447
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,960
His nails.
He changed just now.

448
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,320
I saw his nails in the mirror.
- Calm down. This is Rangga.

449
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,360
There's nothing wrong with him.
- No! His nails were long.

450
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,800
You're just tired.
- I saw it myself.

451
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,640
Why don't you believe me?

452
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,320
I saw it. His face was all black.
- Calm down.

453
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,600
Darling, calm down. Listen to me.
- His nails were long.

454
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,480
It's not that I don't believe you.
I believe you.

455
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,840
I believe you're
having baby blues.

456
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,240
No! This isn't baby blues.

457
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,680
I saw it! His face was all black.
- Listen.

458
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,280
I read that baby blues happens...

459
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,920
...to mothers who feels
unfamiliar with her baby.

460
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,560
Calm down. Tonight, we'll let
Mbok Wati take care of Rangga.

461
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,720
You calm yourself down. Okay?

462
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,200
Are you sure you
have to go tonight?

463
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,400
My workmates are working overtime.
The deadline is approaching.

464
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,600
If I don't go there, everything
will be messy. I have to go.

465
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,600
That baby.
- That baby?

466
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,240
That baby is our baby!
His name is Rangga!

467
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,560
What's wrong with you?
What is your problem?

468
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,120
All of this is only in your head!

469
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:20,880
It's all in your mind!

470
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,280
Mbok Wati left because of you!

471
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,600
Maybe this is the best for you.

472
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,800
Now, you take care
of this place by yourself.

473
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,160
Take care of Rangga
until you can face your fear...

474
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,360
...and you realize that all of this
is only happening in your head!

475
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,440
Rangga?

476
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:24,240
Rangga.

477
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,200
Wait!
- Let me go!

478
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,720
Darling.
- That's the demon baby.

479
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,280
That's Rangga.
- It's not him. He has to die!

480
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,960
That's Rangga, Farah.
- No!

481
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:20,080
That's Rangga. Look at me.

482
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,880
That's Rangga.

483
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,680
That's Rangga.

484
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,080
That's Rangga.

485
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,400
What's wrong?

486
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,240
You saw it?

487
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,600
Yes.

488
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,040
I saw it.

489
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:18,920
I saw it, too.

490
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,040
We have to leave this place.

491
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,320
Excuse me. You just moved in?

492
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,240
Yes, sir. My husband
is unloading the luggages now.

493
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,880
Who are you?
- I'm your next door neighbour.

494
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,600
Your baby's crying non- stop.
Is he sick?

495
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,800
That's just what babies do.

496
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:37,760
Why are you chatting? Let's go in.
- Please continue with your chores.

497
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,160
If you need help.....
- We don't need anything, sir.

498
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,080
Why am I so rude?

499
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,920
Calm down, Rangga.

500
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,560
Stop crying, please.

501
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,600
Rangga.

502
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,760
He's crying again?
- Yes, all day.

503
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,320
May I help to carry him?

504
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,440
Why did he stop crying?
- I don't know.

505
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,880
I didn't do anything.
Maybe I'm experienced.

506
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,200
Here.

507
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:13,520
Thank you.

508
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,920
Can I tell you something?
- Yes. About what?

509
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:23,560
This is important. It's about
the safety of your family.

510
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,680
What do you mean?

511
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:31,280
Hold on. I'm going home first.
I'll be back.

512
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,880
Maybe this story
does not make sense,...

513
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,840
...but your situation...

514
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,680
...reminded me of a case
from several years ago.

515
01:03:58,560 --> 01:04:00,200
What case?

516
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,760
A brutal homicide
and suicide case.

517
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,600
Oh, God!

518
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:08,760
This is the news report.

519
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,520
Because of my carelessness,...

520
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,320
...I caused an
innocent woman her life.

521
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,360
Then the guilt...

522
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:32,400
...made me quit the police force.

523
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:40,600
However, it didn't stop me
from solving this case.

524
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,240
Who was the killer,...

525
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,880
...and how could human force...

526
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,560
...destroy the victim's bones
without any beating mark?

527
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,920
How come a baby...

528
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,000
...turned blue all over...

529
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,320
...from running out of blood?

530
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:14,120
I asked the elders with
spiritual ability in the village.

531
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,280
They said...

532
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,640
...it was because of
a dark ritual.

533
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,120
Sacrificing a baby
to harm other people.

534
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:35,160
The victim's neighbours said...

535
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,960
...the baby was always
crying very loudly...

536
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,680
...during the call of prayers.

537
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,280
What was weirder is that...

538
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,680
...the temperament
of the parents looked different.

539
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,680
They became rude, impatient.

540
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:59,480
Their characteristics
were exactly like...

541
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,120
...what you showed me earlier.

542
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,720
Rafa!

543
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,080
Rafa, come here, quick!

544
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,800
What's wrong?
Rangga won't stop coughing?

545
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,960
It's okay, sweetie.
He won't stop coughing.

546
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,800
Rangga? What's wrong with him?

547
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,800
What's wrong with his mouth?

548
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,680
Why is there hair in his mouth?
- I don't know.

549
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,160
What's wrong?
- No, I'm just.....

550
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,360
Rafa?

551
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,160
It's clearly...

552
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,960
...the doing
of someone vengeful...

553
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,840
...to you.

554
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:12,840
This means that this
person used dark magic...

555
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,120
...or witchcraft to harm you.

556
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,320
These things...

557
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:24,680
...are usually used
in those practices.

558
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:34,360
Your baby is
being used by someone...

559
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,800
...to harm you...

560
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,360
...with dark magic or evil spirit.

561
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,960
So, all of this.....

562
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,720
All of this happened
because of our baby?

563
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,560
Why don't they just hurt me?

564
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,520
Those kind of people are cowards.

565
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,920
They don't have the courage
to face you directly,...

566
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,240
...let alone hurt you.

567
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:08,800
They want to hurt you slowly...

568
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,440
...and also harm
your loved ones,...

569
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:17,320
...like your wife and child.

570
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:22,640
Please, help us.

571
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:26,200
Whatever the way,
just please help us.

572
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:33,200
If God permits,
I'll try my best to help.

573
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,600
All this comes back to you two.

574
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:44,040
You two should make peace,
or have you forgotten your God?

575
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:57,880
Who would want to harm us?

576
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,520
Who?

577
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:07,280
Who clearly threatened me?

578
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,240
And who.....

579
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:16,840
Who lost the bidding...

580
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,640
...because of me?

581
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:22,040
<i>Rafa, I pray that you'll still</i>
<i>be alive to finish this project.</i>

582
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:25,760
<i>Are you threatening me?</i>

583
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,960
I have to end this tonight.

584
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,520
Ronald!

585
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,440
Stop. Stop all this!

586
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,720
Scumbag, what are you doing here?
- Stop all of it now!

587
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,160
Stop what? What?
- Stop your black magic!

588
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:02,000
Don't disturb my family again!
- Black magic?

589
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:07,120
Black magic?
You have to know.

590
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,480
I want to get my revenge on you.

591
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,400
I want to teach you a lesson,
but I want to do it in court.

592
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Do you remember how you
embarrassed me at the bidding?

593
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,400
Do you remember?
You embarrassed me.

594
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:22,240
Now you break into my house,
embarrass me in front of my wife.

595
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,760
Honey, who is he?

596
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,520
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I apologize.

597
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,720
Ronald, please forgive me.

598
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,920
I misunderstood.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

599
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:05,560
Man, I'm really sorry.

600
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,200
I was wrong about you,...

601
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,880
...but my family
is being disturbed...

602
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,560
...and I don't know
what else to do.

603
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,880
I'm so sorry. Forgive me.

604
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,360
Hey!

605
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,240
You know the phrase
"keep your enemies close to you"?

606
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,320
Or "enemy lies
under the blanket"?

607
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:32,880
Dark magic is usually...

608
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,240
...done by people closest to you.

609
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:52,160
Dark magic or witchcraft
can be done in many ways.

610
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,600
For example, using your hair...

611
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:00,720
...to channel his evil doing.

612
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:07,280
He uses baby's placenta
to be ritualised.

613
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,160
With this ritual...

614
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,040
...I curse...

615
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,800
...the baby of Farah Nirmala.

616
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,800
Have a seat, Di.
- Rafa called me.

617
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,400
He asked me to check
on you and Rangga.

618
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,280
Rafa told you?

619
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,520
He told me everything.
You're okay, right?

620
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,000
I'm okay.
- What about your baby?

621
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,960
He's okay.

622
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,200
May I see your baby?

623
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,000
I just want to make sure
that both of you are really fine.

624
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,000
Okay. Wait a minute.

625
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,680
Uncle Edi is here.

626
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,320
He just woke up.

627
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,000
What?

628
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,880
Rafa told me everything.

629
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,640
I think you should take a rest.

630
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,120
Let me hold him.

631
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:13,040
Are you sure? Okay. Wait.

632
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,080
Hold on.

633
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:21,280
Okay, here.
- Okay.

634
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,600
Okay.

635
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,720
He likes you.

636
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,560
Watch his head.

637
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,480
I should be with you.

638
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,440
Imagine me as your husband.

639
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,520
I wouldn't leave
you and our baby...

640
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:13,560
...in critical times like this.

641
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:19,320
Di, what happened
between us is over.

642
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,560
I'm happy with Rafa now.

643
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,280
I thought you're also happy
with someone else.

644
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,600
After all the good times
that we had?

645
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,640
That time...

646
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,800
...we almost had a baby, Farah!

647
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,000
Our baby died, Edi.

648
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,000
I thought we have moved on
with our lives.

649
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,560
You're even friends with Rafa now.

650
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:00,680
I don't understand.

651
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,320
What happened between us
was in the past.

652
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,000
It's in the past?
- Yes.

653
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:09,880
For you, it is!

654
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:15,000
What if I tell you
that it's actually the present?

655
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,280
You are destined to be with me!

656
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:25,800
You and that person, Rafa,...

657
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,400
...should have
only been temporary.

658
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,720
Because of this baby,...

659
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,440
...all of my plans are messed up!

660
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,000
Di.

661
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:47,000
Di.

662
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,560
Pass him to me now.
- Shut up!

663
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,360
Please.
- Don't come close to me!

664
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,080
Do you remember?

665
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,760
I told them that we'd get married!
- Please, Di.

666
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,440
Run!

667
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,880
Rafa!

668
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,000
Rafa.

669
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,880
Give me Rangga!

670
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:51,880
Give him to me now!

671
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,080
I could've killed you before,
but I didn't want to.

672
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,720
I want to see you suffer like this.

673
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,680
Give me Rangga!

674
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,760
That's my child!

675
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:14,320
I'm going to break
every bone in your body.

676
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,520
You don't deserve
to be Farah's husband.

677
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:13,040
<i>There are three of us now.</i>
<i>You have to be tough.</i>

678
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:16,360
<i>Yes.</i>

679
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,600
<i>You have to be tough.</i>

680
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,280
<i>You have to be tough.</i>

681
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,560
That's my child!

682
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:56,360
Even if the love between
the two of you is strong enough...

683
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,600
...to fail my witchcraft,
I don't care.

684
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:08,640
I don't care!
I'll kill all of you myself.

685
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,800
Edi, wait.
- What?

686
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,840
You're weak now.
I'll kill you in a second.

687
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,480
Then I'll kill Farah.

688
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,560
After that, I'll kill your baby!

689
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:16,160
Everything's going to be okay.
