1
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:05,440
Wakey-wakey, count Dracula.
It's time to rise and shine!

2
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,530
Hot! Hot! Hot!

3
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,285
Hot! Hot! Hot!

4
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:27,296
How dare you break
into my castle?

5
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,631
Hi, everyone. I'm Max.

6
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,303
Hey, bat-breath,
you've got the camera

7
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,221
- the wrong way round!
- Huh?

8
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,309
Point it at me!

9
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,936
No! Not at my tummy!

10
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,360
And definitely not at my butt!

11
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:54,072
Today we are
experimenting with...

12
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,784
With this!

13
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,998
The magical amulet of baba yaga.

14
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,294
It bestows magical powers
to whoever holds it.

15
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:09,838
I am totally not supposed
to have this.

16
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,715
I snagged it
when she wasn't looking,

17
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,133
but it's ok.

18
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,178
She's a good witch now.
We all hang out together.

19
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,764
Ok, so there was that time

20
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,475
that she did turn us
into monsters.

21
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,226
And we fought count Dracula.

22
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,772
Don't worry, he's not
coming back any time soon.

23
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,900
We trapped him in his castle
so he can't escape.

24
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,193
And, to be honest,

25
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:35,030
it was actually pretty cool
being a super-strong werewolf!

26
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,406
Ilovedil

27
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,744
but the curse only works
when my family is unhappy.

28
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,831
And we're all happy again now.
Apparently.

29
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,210
So, back to the magical amulet.

30
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,128
Imagine if you will...

31
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,466
The marriage
of magic and science!

32
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,760
I can make the world
a better place,

33
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,471
just like my heroes, the starrs!

34
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,766
We '/I make the world
a better place!

35
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,395
This is outrageous! Who are you?

36
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,189
My name is Mila. Mila starr.

37
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,274
And we have some tests to do.

38
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,068
Tests?

39
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,117
- Ok, what smells gross?
- What are you doing?

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,286
Hmm. Thought so.
You've got a cavity.

41
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,706
Third molar, top right.
I mean left.

42
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:28,959
I knew it! It's been hurting me
for decades.

43
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,587
When was the last time
you flossed?

44
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:36,174
Er... thirteen hundred and...

45
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,385
Dental hygiene, inadequate.

46
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,178
You dare to insult
count Dracula,

47
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,097
the prince of darkness?

48
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,099
You shall pay dearly for this!

49
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,352
I don't think so, your highness.

50
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,273
Just sit back...

51
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,900
And relax.

52
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,884
Hmm, that one was still ok.

53
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,137
Ok, experiment number one.

54
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,766
What is that smell?

55
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,020
That can't be me.
I just showered three days ago!

56
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,275
Change of plan.
New experiment number one.

57
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,069
Magical everlasting deodorant!

58
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:45,160
By night, by day,
send foul odours away!

59
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,798
Yes, yes, yes!

60
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,883
No, no, no!

61
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,479
Mum, dad. I've caught Dracula!

62
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,815
Of course you have!

63
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,818
You are the best daughter
in the world, Mila.

64
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,694
You're the very best.

65
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,489
So, what's my next mission?

66
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,533
Capture this witch.

67
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,703
Experiment number 27.

68
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,915
I will transform a bat
into a handsome prince!

69
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:37,295
By day, by night,
create regal might!

70
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,257
It's working!

71
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,883
Yes, it's working!

72
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,051
It's...

73
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,594
Whoops.

74
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,556
Sorry.

75
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,849
Oh, a message.

76
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,267
School group chat.

77
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,438
Someone's hacked my account
and uploaded my dance video!

78
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,741
It's ok.
Maybe no one will see...

79
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,411
It.

80
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,538
Dancing? At school?

81
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,249
You've got to stop
being such an easy target.

82
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:19,045
- I was practising!
- For what? Dancing with dorks?

83
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,715
I can't believe
you've embarrassed me like this.

84
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,134
How am I supposed to show
my face in school tomorrow?

85
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,260
What do you care?

86
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,762
I thought you were
dropping out of school.

87
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,599
That was supposed to be
a secret!

88
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,058
And I haven't decided yet.

89
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,352
Well, I think you should.

90
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,563
They'd have to invent
a whole new alphabet

91
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,732
for your grades
to get any lower.

92
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,277
I got a c in home ec!

93
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,828
Guys, I'm sorry to interrupt
your argument,

94
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,122
but we do have a wedding
to go to.

95
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,126
Tell that to Max!
He isn't even ready yet!

96
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,046
The wedding is today?
I'll be two minutes.

97
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,842
Remember the time we nearly died
fighting that evil vampire?

98
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:09,512
- Er, yeah.
- Sometimes I miss that.

99
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,308
What is taking them so long?

100
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,855
Don't weddings
make you feel romantic?

101
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,774
Not when we're late for them.

102
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,534
Don't hug me in public.

103
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,631
Ah, freak out!

104
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,634
Le freak, c'est chic

105
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,135
freak out

106
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,889
ah, freak out!

107
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,642
Le freak, c'est chic

108
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,851
freak out

109
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,148
have you heard

110
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,192
about the new dance craze?

111
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,318
Listen to us

112
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,445
I'm sure you'll be amazed

113
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,825
big fun to be had by everyone

114
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,245
it surely can be done

115
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,663
ah, freak out!

116
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,040
Le freak

117
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,792
freak out!

118
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,111
Come on, Max.

119
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:53,950
Max wishbone,
get into this car right...

120
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,330
Come on, dig it!

121
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:17,932
Come on, dad, we're late.
What are we waiting for?

122
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,794
I love a wedding, don't you?

123
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,099
Fay, you hardly say two words
these days. Are you ok?

124
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,434
Of course.
Oh, apart from the fact

125
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,770
that I have absolutely
no future!

126
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,650
Why would you say that,
sweetheart?

127
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,610
You really don't know, do you?

128
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,696
- Fay's dropping out of school.
- What?

129
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,865
- Oh, Max!
- Fay?

130
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,493
I'm not. At least I don't...
I don't think I am.

131
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,912
You are not quitting school!

132
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,165
Out of the way!
I'm driving here!

133
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,416
Ok, let's go.

134
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,179
I'm no good at anything!

135
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,556
I'm flunking everything

136
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,559
and you'd know that
if you paid any attention to me!

137
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,602
But we do pay attention to...

138
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,357
Everyone in my class
is good at something.

139
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,318
Ashley is a runner, Jenny won
young journalist of the year.

140
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:53,945
This is Taylor.

141
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,948
She's 16 and she's going
to medical school.

142
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,950
And do you know why that is?

143
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,785
She's really good
at science stuff?

144
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,037
Her parents support her!

145
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,456
All of my friends' parents
support them.

146
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,585
- We do support you.
- Oh, really?

147
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,505
I was in a play last week
and none of you came to see it.

148
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,819
- I got held up at the book shop.
- I had a meeting.

149
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,720
Well, you were playing a sheep.

150
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,889
And not even the main one.

151
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,060
We're always here, fay.

152
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,271
We just don't feel the need
to be like those parents

153
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,106
who watch
their kids' every move.

154
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,066
We trust you to make
your own decisions.

155
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,485
And there is something
you're really good at.

156
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:35,778
Really? What?

157
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:36,988
Staring at your phone.

158
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,367
Did you know that smartphones

159
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,287
are covered in 18 times
more germs than a toilet seat?

160
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,456
Eat this, then!

161
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,250
What's this
you're sending me, fay?

162
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:55,924
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
You just look so funny.

163
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,223
No one laughed at me
when I was a werewolf.

164
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:09,646
I told you we'd make it on time.

165
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,358
Come on, disco king.

166
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,486
Erm...
Didn't you use to be a frog?

167
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,333
- What's up?
- Those are girls from my school.

168
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,668
80? Go and say hi.

169
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,920
I don't want them to see me.

170
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,838
What's the problem?
You look great.

171
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,174
I do, dontl?

172
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,810
- Is that Max?
- Wow.

173
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,549
And shared.

174
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,723
Can't you get through one day
without embarrassing yourself?

175
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,475
This is bullying.

176
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,102
I'm gonna talk to their parents,

177
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,730
and their teachers
and their teachers' parents.

178
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,732
Please, let it go, mum.

179
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:39,652
- But they're making fun of you.
- You'll just make it worse.

180
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,452
Max, it'll be ok.

181
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:54,709
Oh, you two look so sweet!

182
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,713
This is the happiest day
of my life.

183
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,215
Sorry we're late.

184
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:06,012
No late, on time you are.

185
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,597
Hey, fay. Put your phone away.

186
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,474
Don't shout, frank.
We're in church!

187
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,935
- That was my foot.
- My wedding, this is.

188
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,188
You are now being happy.

189
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,564
Pronto.

190
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,150
Or else I will be
turning you into...

191
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,111
Sorry, reverend.

192
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:26,616
This isn't the time for cursing,
this is the time for loving.

193
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,536
Emma, frank,
you being witnesses.

194
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,082
- Fay, you be taking photos.
- Fine.

195
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,962
Max, please try not
to trip over your trousers.

196
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:48,429
Now, who wants
to married getting? We do!

197
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:52,683
Will you, renfield,
take this woman, baba yaga...

198
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,193
To be your wedded wife,
to love her,

199
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,406
comfort her,
honour and keep her...

200
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,661
In sickness and in health...

201
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,168
Ok, I guess I'm no good
at photography either.

202
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,003
Wait? What is that?

203
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,882
Until death do you part?

204
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,438
What is it you are wanting
at our wedding?

205
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:39,939
You.

206
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,489
I think you are not knowing
what it is you are facing.

207
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,659
My amulet!

208
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,245
Uh-oh.

209
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,124
I know I've got it
right... right here.

210
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,336
Somewhere.

211
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,202
Leave baba alone!

212
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,873
Cool trousers. Do they make them
in your size?

213
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,459
Who are you any...

214
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,544
Way?

215
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,134
Why would I want
to tell you that?

216
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,679
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got a job to do.

217
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,189
Not my baba!

218
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,986
Baba!

219
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,780
Stop the drones!

220
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,661
We need to get the controller
from whoever she is!

221
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,883
I'll get her!

222
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,012
Ok, maybe I won't.

223
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,438
Baba!

224
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,446
Baba! My snookie-pooks!

225
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,408
Just hand it over.

226
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,119
You don't stand a chance
against me.

227
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,497
I've got skills.

228
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,749
What? Ordering pizza?

229
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,086
Neverjoke about pizza.

230
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,718
Let go, pizza boy!

231
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,053
Don't call me pizza boy!

232
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:27,273
- Ew!
- Yuck, yuck, yuck.

233
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,243
Give it back!

234
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,078
Yeah, never.

235
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,505
Er, guys? I don't think

236
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,299
you should be throwing it
around like that.

237
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,217
- Why not?
- Because of that.

238
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,559
Baba, hold on!

239
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,729
Trying!

240
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,440
Baba!

241
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,361
Baba!

242
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,624
I'm right here, pizza boy.

243
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:33,381
Baba, my snookie-pooks!
I'll save you!

244
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,383
Going somewhere?

245
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,134
Huh?

246
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,973
What are you doing?
We'll crash! You're too heavy!

247
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,184
Ok, so I could lose
a few pounds.

248
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:49,063
No need to get personal.
Now, let go of my friends!

249
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,695
Baba!

250
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,029
After them!

251
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,365
Max?

252
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,126
Let go! I'll catch you!

253
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,260
No, no, no! Not again!

254
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,929
What am I doing?

255
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,518
- Watch out!
- I can't see anything!

256
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,939
Right! Go right!

257
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,275
No, that's left! The other way!

258
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,778
- Why didn't you turn right?
- That was right!

259
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,879
Phew, that was close, pizza boy.

260
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,090
Are you crazy?
We almost got killed!

261
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,384
You can't even tell
left from right!

262
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,220
Bye-bye, pizza boy!

263
00:21:03,304 --> 00:21:07,099
Oh, and give us back
baba and renfield!

264
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,352
Why are you all
spinning around like that?

265
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,981
The end is near!

266
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:17,985
She can't even tell
her left from her right.

267
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,949
Stupid girl.
If I was still a werewolf,

268
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,243
I'd have shown her
what's left and right!

269
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,703
I couldn't save them.

270
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,830
You did the best
you could, sweetheart.

271
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:33,000
- But it wasn't good enough.
- Welcome to my world.

272
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,712
I haven't got a chance
against that girl, but...

273
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,298
Werewolf Max does!

274
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,302
Max, no!

275
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,513
Just one tiny spell.

276
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,390
Mum! He's gonna turn us all
into monsters again!

277
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,477
Max, what did we say
about cursing the family?

278
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,522
But I won't change all of us.
Just me!

279
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,398
Max...

280
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:59,443
Magic is best left in
the hands of the professionals.

281
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,615
Look, I've been practising.

282
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,743
I'm practically a witch myself.

283
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,209
By fire, by light,

284
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,962
by all things bright...

285
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,131
Frank, do something!

286
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,175
Prepare me for the fight...

287
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,886
Ok! What, exactly?

288
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,723
On this magical monster night!

289
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:34,937
I told you!

290
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,730
Stop him!

291
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,077
Yes! Were-Max is back!

292
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,208
Great job, Max.

293
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,508
Come on, old flicker box!

294
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:12,558
Live from
the starr headquarters,

295
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:15,978
join our favourite inventors,
Marlene and Maddox starr

296
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,605
unveiling
their mind-boggling tech

297
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,857
to make the world
a better place!

298
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,151
Welcome, folks!

299
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,029
Let's take a look
at our new starr rocket cruiser.

300
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,073
Blazing-fast ignition,
three supersonic boosters.

301
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:32,286
Carries a load of 50 tons,
no biggy. Let's stay focused.

302
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,414
Because on top of it all,
it's remote controlled.

303
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,707
Simply press this field

304
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,960
and the burning chambers
are preheated in five seconds.

305
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,463
After that, everything
is ready for take-off.

306
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,095
Welcome back, my darling.

307
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:51,764
Hi, mum.

308
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,933
Why have you brought me
three creatures?

309
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,101
The husband
was a bit too clingy.

310
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,521
And did anything else happen?

311
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,274
Well, there was some resistance
among the wedding guests,

312
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,109
but I was able
to deal with it quickly.

313
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:06,987
Oh. Can't have been that quick.

314
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,490
You're 14 minutes
behind schedule.

315
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,868
Mila will make up for it
next time. Right?

316
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,411
Of course I will.

317
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:18,540
- Ok! Let's take a look at this.
- Already?

318
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,209
Can't we hang out
for a little while

319
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,961
before I have to leave again?

320
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:26,465
Mila, our project
is to save mankind.

321
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,884
There's nothing more important.

322
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,512
You're right. I'm sorry.

323
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:36,725
Right! Your new targets are
Nessie, the Loch Ness monster,

324
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,771
and yeti, the snow monster
of the himalayas.

325
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,857
Ok. There's no way
those two monsters

326
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:46,151
are going to fit inside
the starr-copter.

327
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,906
Then it's a good thing
we invented this.

328
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,996
What is it?

329
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,123
A shrinking-ray gun.

330
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,959
One day,
all the world's plastic waste

331
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,129
will be shrunk to the size
of a single atom.

332
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,048
Wow. Nice going, mum and dad.

333
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:12,886
I'm going to make you
regret the day

334
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,222
you messed
with wilberforce renfield!

335
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,644
Excuse me, we're the good guys.

336
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,855
It won't hurt him, will it?

337
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,691
The process
is completely painless.

338
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:30,779
I must warn you,
I've got a white coat in karate!

339
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,799
You guys are geniuses!

340
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,469
When I grow up,
I want to be just like you!

341
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,263
Of course you do.
You're a starr.

342
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,265
And we starrs...

343
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,351
We'll make the world
a better place!

344
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,896
I won't be long!

345
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:24,500
This was supposed to be
the happiest day of my life.

346
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,090
So, now I look like

347
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,801
3,000-year-old meat loaf again.

348
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,762
I'm putting all your
embarrassing photos online.

349
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,723
I told you not to play
with baba's amulet.

350
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:41,975
You are absolutely impossible.

351
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,769
Turn us back, right now!

352
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,731
I'm sorry. I... I can't.

353
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:50,526
What do you mean, you can't?

354
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,694
Huh?

355
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:55,906
Don't you remember?

356
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,658
The first time
baba used a spell,

357
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,452
she only wanted to change mum
into a monster.

358
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,371
But the spell changed us all
because...

359
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,873
Because we were unhappy.

360
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,585
And we only changed back
when we were happy again.

361
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,004
Great, so we're gonna be
monsters forever.

362
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:15,134
So, I guess it's true.
We're an unhappy family again.

363
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,553
Did you really need magic
to tell you that?

364
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,431
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

365
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:26,019
No, mum. It's not yourfault.
It's dad's fault too.

366
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,316
What?

367
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:47,207
Ok, so I guess we're down
to one responsible parent again.

368
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:50,794
Hey! Look on the bright side.
Now that we've monstered up,

369
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:52,629
our odds of saving
baba and renfield

370
00:27:52,713 --> 00:27:54,548
have risen exponentially.

371
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,341
I hate it when you speak nerd.

372
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,970
Look at us!
We're faster and stronger.

373
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,973
Mum's a vampire,
you've got mummy magic.

374
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,349
We can totally get them back!

375
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,560
Ok, you've got a point, I guess.

376
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:09,771
But how can we save them
if we don't know where they are?

377
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,858
- With this.
- Sweetheart, no offence,

378
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,777
but you haven't exactly
got the hang of that thing.

379
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,323
Frank! No!

380
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,493
Sorry!

381
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,580
Trust me. I can find anyone.

382
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,958
All I have to do
is think really hard about them.

383
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:34,129
By day, by night,
bring me second sight!

384
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,345
You are supposed to be finding
baba and renfield,

385
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,180
not your new girl crush.

386
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,349
She's not my crush.

387
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,017
She's just a girl

388
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,395
who I totally can't stop
thinking about.

389
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,273
She can't even tell
left from right.

390
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,650
Where's she flying to?

391
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,697
Scotland, Loch Ness.

392
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,451
That girl is our only lead.

393
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,744
Can you get us there?

394
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,164
Sure. I know
baba's teleportation spell.

395
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,041
Couldn't we just book a flight?

396
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:15,212
There's no time!
Disappear, pronto!

397
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,806
Disappear, pronto!

398
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,231
Disappear, pronto!

399
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,484
There are now claims

400
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,445
that the former president
is in fact a martian.

401
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,199
- Who are you?
- Just fans.

402
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:45,909
Disappear, pronto!

403
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,504
So, we're back where we started.

404
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,799
I think that's enough magic,
don't you?

405
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:04,303
Ok. But how will we get
to Loch Ness now?

406
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,471
Er... mat-met.

407
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,182
Mat-met.

408
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,187
Is it just me or is dad making
less sense than usual?

409
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,692
Mat-met.

410
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,820
- Oh, he means bat-jet.
- Mat-met.

411
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:25,824
- Dracula's bat-jet?
- It's in Cheyenne's barn.

412
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,118
Your dad thought it might
come in handy one day.

413
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,703
Uff da!

414
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,621
Do we even know how to fly it?

415
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:35,000
- Well, how hard can it be?
- Er, very.

416
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,794
Come on! We're wasting time.

417
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,797
- Ooh, I feel strange.
- Mat-met.

418
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,966
Mum, what's the matter?

419
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,887
I feel... ooh, I'm hungry.

420
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,350
Cheyenne's still in India,

421
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,934
so let's head
straight for the barn.

422
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,896
Blood! Put me down!

423
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,524
Mum, I can't believe you had
Dracula's bat-jet all this time

424
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,318
and didn't tell us!

425
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,572
- Yeah, I don't think...
- Hungry!

426
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,825
Mum and dad are really up for
answering questions right now.

427
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,494
Uff da.

428
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:20,587
- The bat-jet!
- Ha, I knew it.

429
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,339
That's no lawn mower.

430
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,800
You need a pilot's licence
for that.

431
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,427
Ah, you must be
Cheyenne's annoying neighbour.

432
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,931
He won't be annoying
once I've drained his blood!

433
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:35,185
That's it!
I'm calling the police!

434
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,188
Look deep into my eyes.

435
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,900
You're a beautiful dancer.

436
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:46,113
And now you dance
the dying swan.

437
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,203
I'd forgotten
how much fun this is.

438
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,128
Oh! Put me down!

439
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,840
Hungry! Let me go!

440
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,843
Not like that!

441
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,849
Er, why are you looking at me
like that?

442
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,561
- Hungry!
- Ok, that's not good.

443
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,566
Er... I've got an idea.

444
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,817
Keep her busy!

445
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,236
I don't think that's gonna be
a problem.

446
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:28,738
Blood! Hungry!

447
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,740
Mum, I know
what you're thinking,

448
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:34,161
but trust me, I taste like
a mouldy sandwich right now.

449
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:41,543
Dracula had a stash of
plasma pills in his food locker.

450
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,214
- Fay, I'm so sorry!
- You tried to drain me of blood.

451
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,176
Great parenting, mum.

452
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,804
Er, does anyone actually know
how to fly this thing?

453
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:54,181
Renfield does,

454
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,974
but he's kind of captured
right now.

455
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,435
Maybe there's a manual
in the glove compartment.

456
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,229
I don't think there's a manual
or a glove compartment.

457
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,357
It's just a matter of
discovering the user interface.

458
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:05,859
It's probably intuitive,

459
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,321
so, if I'm the pilot
and I want to start the engine,

460
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,823
I just press, er, this!

461
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,955
Uh-uh.

462
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,252
Oh, just make it start already!

463
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,257
Your wish is my command.

464
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,927
I am your voice-activated
autopilot.

465
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,512
And, yes.

466
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,306
I really do look this good.

467
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,976
- Dracula?
- My mife!

468
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:47,526
It's ok, it's just a hologram.
The bat-jet is voice controlled.

469
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,278
For those times when you've got
more important things to do

470
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,489
than press buttons.

471
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,866
So, we just tell it
where we want to go?

472
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,368
I... I guess so.

473
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,913
Er, Dracula?
Take us to Loch Ness.

474
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,750
I've found three entries
Loch Ness in the local area.

475
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,212
Loch Ness fish restaurant
is 2.3 kilometres away.

476
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,714
Loch Ness tartan manufacturers
on the other hand

477
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,967
is 3.1 kilometres away.

478
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,887
Loch Ness, Scotland!
As fast as you can!

479
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,533
Dad, I'm in position.

480
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,034
That's great, Mila.

481
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,120
The Loch Ness monster
is your next target

482
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,122
for project save mankind.

483
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,999
It has been hiding
at the bottom of the lake

484
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,042
for thousands of years.

485
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,877
She looks kind of friendly.

486
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:52,299
No! It's a monster, Mia,
and definitely not friendly!

487
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,718
Of course, sorry, mum. I...

488
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,682
- I'll have to call you back.
- Don't you...

489
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,893
Dare disconnect us.

490
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,771
She's getting more wilful
every day!

491
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:10,442
Don't worry, we only need her to
fetch the remaining specimens.

492
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,569
Then our collection
will be complete,

493
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,571
and her mission will be over.

494
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,997
What is that girl doing here?

495
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,207
Judging by the way
she grabbed baba,

496
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,585
I'd say she's some sort
of hunter.

497
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,712
I bet she's here
for the Loch Ness monster.

498
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,965
That's ridiculous.
Nessie doesn't exist.

499
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:36,301
Said the vampire
to the werewolf.

500
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,888
- I'm sure I'm right.
- Who are these weirdos?

501
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,556
Well, maybe it does exist.

502
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,767
Nessie sightings
have been reported

503
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,186
for more than a thousand years.

504
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:49,105
And, fun fact, since 1934,

505
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,441
Nessie has been
a protected species.

506
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,361
There is nothing fun
about those facts.

507
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,947
There's her 'copter,
but I can't see her.

508
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,201
Hey! Don't touch that!

509
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,952
Who are you?

510
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,081
Where are our friends?

511
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,041
- Pizza boy?
- Yeah!

512
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,627
I mean, no! I'm were-Max.

513
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,962
So, you're a werewolf now?

514
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:14,297
Exactly!

515
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:15,882
At least you're not wearing

516
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,967
those ridiculous trousers
anymore!

517
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,344
Exactly!

518
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,097
Cos you're not wearing trousers
at all!

519
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,599
Exactly.

520
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,144
That's enough!

521
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,362
Now, listen here, young lady.

522
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:41,533
Sorry, I don't really have time
to listen, old lady!

523
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:52,001
Uff da!

524
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,051
Which do you like better?

525
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:01,594
Basketball

526
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,639
or football?

527
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,599
Huh?

528
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,406
Frank, wake up. Wake up!

529
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,533
Hey, Supergirl.

530
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,493
Time for a little hypnosis.

531
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,329
Look deep into my eyes.

532
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:33,251
You are going to dance
like mc hammer.

533
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,173
Look in my eyes, man,
you can't touch this

534
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:41,384
yo, let me bust the funky lyrics

535
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,927
fresh new kicks and pants

536
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,305
you got it like that,
now you know you wanna dance

537
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,681
so, move, outta your...

538
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,810
You gotta...

539
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:55,106
Look in my eyes,
man, you can't touch this

540
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,941
ready for round two?

541
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,903
Sorry, pizza boy!
I've got work to do.

542
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,489
Stop calling me pizza boy!

543
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,751
Mila? Are you all right?

544
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,212
Hi, dad, sorry for
the little interruption earlier.

545
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,630
Let's get to work.

546
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,508
Uh, ok, right. Where was I?

547
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,886
Ah, yes! We've added
a little update to your suit

548
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,638
to help you find the monster.

549
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,182
The last attempt to find it
was in 2003

550
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,644
using 600 sonars,
which we hacked.

551
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,480
We altered their results so
they couldn't find the monster.

552
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,567
But you'll manage in no time!
Just follow the drone.

553
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,876
Wow, beautiful plants.

554
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,151
What is it?

555
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,254
You? Again?

556
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,143
Come on, come on!

557
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,734
What... what happened?

558
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,696
That was pretty brave.

559
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,115
Brave? Me?

560
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,537
And also really stupid.

561
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,957
I won't let you take Nessie.

562
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,042
You've got to stop trying
to beat me.

563
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,919
You're only going to get hurt.

564
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,590
You saved me.

565
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:53,302
Of course I did.
I'm one of the good guys.

566
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:54,679
Oh, great.

567
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,724
Because of you, I'm totally
behind schedule again.

568
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,392
Thanks, pizza boy.

569
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:02,103
My name is Max. What's yours?

570
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,354
Erm...

571
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,523
Come on.
If we're going to be nemeses,

572
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,525
we should at least know
each other's names.

573
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,862
- Mila. Mila starr.
- Starr?

574
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,615
As in Marlene and Maddox starr?
The tech wizards?

575
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,035
Well, I just call them
mum and dad.

576
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:18,202
Whoa!

577
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,705
Yep, they're pretty "whoa",
all right!

578
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,373
Those guys are geniuses!

579
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,001
They've made billions
with their inventions,

580
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,587
and they give it all to charity.

581
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:31,424
They have financed
1,111 orphanages

582
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,051
all over the world.

583
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,053
How come I know everything
about the starrs

584
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,555
but I didn't know
they had a daughter?

585
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,683
Well, they're keeping it secret.

586
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,895
- Why?
- They're geniuses.

587
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,814
If they told me,
I probably wouldn't understand.

588
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,736
Are you sure it's not because
you're flying around the world

589
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,238
trapping innocent witches
and sea creatures?

590
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,949
That's a beast.

591
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,911
She's no beast!

592
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,872
Just look at her!

593
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,751
She just doesn't want
to be called names.

594
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,671
Or be made fun of
because she's different.

595
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,425
And you definitely shouldn't
take photos or videos of her

596
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:15,802
when she's dancing.

597
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:18,763
And put them on... ow!

598
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:23,851
Oh! And put them online
for everyone to laugh at.

599
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,439
You've stopped talking
about the monster, haven't you?

600
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,319
Good guys don't do what you do.

601
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,782
It's... it's all for a reason.

602
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,577
And what reason is that?

603
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,413
I'm not supposed to say.

604
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,791
Wait!

605
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,629
- Frank, wake up!
- Can't touch this

606
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,964
wake up!

607
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,383
Look in my eyes,
man, you can't touch this

608
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,302
mum, dad, fay!
We've got to stop her!

609
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,432
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

610
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,017
Wake up!

611
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,894
Come on.

612
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:09,856
Wake up!

613
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:12,733
Oh! Finally!

614
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,694
We've got to get to the jet!

615
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,070
Can't touch this

616
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,578
We have to follow that monster!

617
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,037
She isn't a monster.

618
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,623
She's just made
some bad decisions.

619
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,836
You were talking about Nessie,
weren't you?

620
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,380
So, you've got a thing
for the weird girl

621
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,923
who catches monsters.

622
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:39,844
No! There's just something
not quite right about her.

623
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,013
Yeah, she's a kidnapper.

624
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,973
No, there's...
There's something else.

625
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,975
- What?
- I don't know,

626
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,311
but I'm going to find out.

627
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:51,147
Dracula, do not let
that starr-copter get away!

628
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,858
Your wish is my command.

629
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,827
Thank you for choosing
Dracula airlines.

630
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,412
We hope you have
a pleasant flight.

631
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,541
Please stow your luggage
out of sight

632
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,460
and prepare
to surrender your soul

633
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,337
to the prince of darkness.

634
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,714
That's me.

635
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,050
Please remain seated
throughout the flight,

636
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,803
with your seat belt
tightly fastened at all times.

637
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,723
In the unlikely event
of cabin depressurisation,

638
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:29,060
an oxygen mask will fall
from an overhead panel.

639
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,315
Ah! So that's where
I put my bowling ball.

640
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,988
Stop! Stop! Stop!

641
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,329
Jet, touch down, gently.

642
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,625
Welcome to the himalayas.

643
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,253
As you disembark,
please remember your luggage

644
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:58,881
and to tell your pilot just
how devilishly handsome he is.

645
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:41,507
You won't give up,
will you, pizza boy?

646
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:48,306
I'm not wearing enough bandages
for snow!

647
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:49,932
Look!

648
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,935
Tracks! These feet
are as big as yours, dad!

649
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:54,437
Uff da.

650
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,397
These might lead us to Mila!

651
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,983
Oh, so now she's "Mila".

652
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,695
Uff da.

653
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:04,864
Huh!

654
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,004
Yeti!

655
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,387
And he doesn't look happy.

656
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,438
I'm sure if we just explain
nicely why we're here,

657
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:38,814
he won't eat us.

658
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,609
Ok, you first.

659
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,652
Greetings, we come...

660
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,573
In peace.

661
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:53,704
Uff da?

662
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,249
Love is in the air

663
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:58,793
uff da.

664
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:01,253
- Uff da.
- Every sight and every sound

665
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:03,672
- uff da.
- Uff da.

666
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:05,800
Love is in the air

667
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:08,427
in the thunder of the sea

668
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,517
and I don't know
if I'm just dreaming

669
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:19,188
- don't know if I feel sane
- uff da!

670
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:22,525
But it's something
that I must believe in

671
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:26,654
and it's there
when you call out my name

672
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,957
Love is in the air

673
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,669
love is in the air

674
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,463
I'm so glad
no one knows me out here.

675
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:58,185
Uff da. Uff da. Uff da.

676
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:01,147
Thanks for distracting him
for me!

677
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,732
- Uff da! Uff da!
- Mila!

678
00:49:03,816 --> 00:49:05,192
Sorry, pizza boy.

679
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,027
Gotta fly!

680
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,869
I've got this, dad.

681
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,621
As a human,
I might not be good at anything,

682
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:22,334
but as a mummy,
I can do everything!

683
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,800
Fay! Stop spinning!

684
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:32,511
You're causing an avalanche!

685
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:34,680
Mila, look out!

686
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:53,699
We've got to help her!

687
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,118
It's all my fault!

688
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,126
Watch out, kids!

689
00:50:09,882 --> 00:50:11,300
Don't worry, I've got you!

690
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,553
But who's got you?

691
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:33,364
Uff da!

692
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,408
W... where's Mila?

693
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,494
Mila?

694
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,041
Hello?

695
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,751
Mila?

696
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,878
- Heho?
- Huh?

697
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:51,257
- I'm here!
- Mila!

698
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,260
- Pizza boy!
- Hold on!

699
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,512
I wasn't planning on letting go!

700
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,265
Can you see my backpack?
There's a rope in it.

701
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:02,268
I'll get it. Don't go anywhere!

702
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:05,229
Here it is, pizza boy!

703
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:07,856
I can't find it!

704
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,984
Left pocket!

705
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,820
Red rope!

706
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,160
You meant the right pocket!

707
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:23,539
I don't need a lesson!
I just need a rope!

708
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,707
Stop!

709
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,125
Can't have you fall down too.

710
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:35,843
Frank, help us!

711
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:38,721
Frank!

712
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:41,682
Frank!

713
00:51:52,401 --> 00:51:54,612
Maybe we should get up?

714
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:57,072
We should.

715
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:00,034
- Now?
- Now.

716
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,869
Max? Are you ok?

717
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,287
No problem.

718
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,040
So, we just saved your life.

719
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,667
I think you owe us some answers.

720
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,669
What happened to our friends?

721
00:52:10,753 --> 00:52:13,297
They... they're with my parents.

722
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,590
What are they doing to them?

723
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,092
I don't know. I just know
that they need them.

724
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:19,803
- For what?
- To save humankind!

725
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:21,972
But, how?

726
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,432
I don't know.

727
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,518
They only tell me what I need
to know to do my job.

728
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,020
So, you kidnap our friends,

729
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,521
drag creatures
out of their homes

730
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:30,856
and you don't even know why?

731
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,442
My parents have their reasons.

732
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,652
They can't be good reasons

733
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,279
if it means taking everyone
against their will.

734
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,239
My parents are the starrs,

735
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,950
the best and most noble people
on earth.

736
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:45,245
My parents would never ask me
to do something like that,

737
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,039
and they're not noble at all.

738
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:49,958
Uff da.

739
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:54,630
Mila, think about it.
Something isn't right.

740
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:55,881
I've got to go.

741
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,966
Stay! We'll talk!

742
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,180
Sorry, I've got a job to do.

743
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,683
- Mila!
- What?

744
00:53:05,766 --> 00:53:07,601
Ask your parents
what their plan is!

745
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,651
Could someone
turn on the heating?

746
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:41,385
Mila! You are 73 minutes
behind schedule!

747
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:44,388
And you haven't even caught
the final monster.

748
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,601
- No. And I'm not going to.
- What?

749
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,606
At least not until you tell me
exactly what you need them for.

750
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,861
- Hmm.
- You don't need to know that.

751
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:02,781
Why? Why is there so much
you don't tell me?

752
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:05,075
Why can't people know
I'm your daughter?

753
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:08,454
Mila starr,
you are on very thin ice.

754
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,957
I think we should show her
what happens to the monsters.

755
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,836
As a reward? For her insolence?

756
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:19,840
Marlene, it's time.
She's proved herself.

757
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,050
Come with us.

758
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,779
Finally.

759
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:55,292
At last I get to see
what's on level x!

760
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,045
You certainly do.

761
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,881
This is an exciting time
for us, Mila.

762
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:05,052
Your mother and I have finally
found a way to save mankind.

763
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,721
- How?
- We have developed a machine

764
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,890
which will allow us
to live forever.

765
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:12,601
You mean, no one will ever die?

766
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,395
No more sickness,
no more disease.

767
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:17,481
We will eradicate it all.

768
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,149
That's incredible!

769
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:22,319
But what do you need
the monsters for?

770
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:26,824
We'll show you, Mila,
but no one else must ever know.

771
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,542
Wow, we are really high!

772
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:40,629
High enough
not to be observed by anyone.

773
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,549
Why are they in there?

774
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:47,261
What do Dracula, baba yaga,
Nessie and the yeti

775
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:49,137
all have in common?

776
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:50,722
Definitely bad breath,

777
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,308
but I'm guessing
that's not the answer.

778
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,145
They've been alive
for centuries,

779
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,399
and we have found a way to tap
into that immortal energy.

780
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,985
So no one will ever get ill
or die.

781
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:04,778
But what happens to them?

782
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,282
Why does that matter?

783
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,076
I'm pretty sure
it matters to them.

784
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,247
They are abominations.

785
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,082
No, they're not!

786
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:20,961
Mila, it's ok.
Nothing bad happens to them.

787
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,045
Really?

788
00:56:22,129 --> 00:56:24,339
Have we ever lied to you?

789
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:30,012
We're the starrs!
All three of us.

790
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,264
And we starrs...

791
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,433
We'll make the world
a better place?

792
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,602
Did she say it? I couldn't hear.

793
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,730
We'll make the world
a better place.

794
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:40,981
One more time.

795
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,109
We will make the world
a better place!

796
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,736
So, what do you say?

797
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,363
Are you gonna get
our last monster?

798
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:50,365
Consider it done!

799
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:54,077
Why did you show her all this?

800
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:57,748
To stop her asking questions.

801
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,754
- Is the test subject ready?
- Of course.

802
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:17,476
Ok, so, now we're here,
where do we go next?

803
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,728
I could find out
where baba and renfield are,

804
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:22,356
if mum would let me have
the amulet back.

805
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,567
I don't know if magic
is a good idea, Max.

806
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:27,778
It's just a location spell.

807
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:30,697
I've already turned us
into monsters.

808
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,658
What else
could possibly go wrong?

809
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:35,243
Oh, you did not just say that!

810
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:36,536
Mum?

811
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:39,790
Ok, but be careful.

812
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:44,336
By day, by night,
give me second sight!

813
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:50,717
Oh, wow!
The unmistakable twin peaks

814
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,053
of the legendary island
of tora-tora.

815
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,763
You've found Mila again.

816
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:58,558
Could you stop thinking
about her for just ten seconds?

817
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,060
I'm trying.

818
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,233
You like her, don't you?

819
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,653
No! She's a know-it-all
and a show-off.

820
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,739
And she can't even tell
left from right.

821
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,412
Wow, he really likes her.

822
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,830
Uff da.

823
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,637
I'm a starr.

824
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:38,515
I am a starr.

825
00:58:38,598 --> 00:58:40,308
I am a starr.

826
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,149
Pizza boy!

827
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:58,160
According to the amulet,
she's not too far away!

828
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,751
You just can't stay away,
can you?

829
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,795
Did you ask your parents
what their plan is?

830
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:11,465
Yes, I know exactly what it is.

831
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,676
But it's top secret, I'm afraid,
so I won't be telling you.

832
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,137
Will they let our friends go?

833
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,474
No. I'm sorry.
They're too important.

834
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,602
- For what?
- I can't tell you!

835
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:25,979
At least tell us where they are.

836
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,274
But they're our friends.

837
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,152
I'm sorry, I can't.

838
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,575
Well, I'm sorry too.

839
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:45,207
Well, if that's the way
you want it.

840
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,756
Whoa.

841
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,760
Oh, no.

842
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:01,223
Mila, it's not too late
to change your mind.

843
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:07,938
Huh?

844
01:00:10,774 --> 01:00:12,109
Uh-oh!

845
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,618
Out of my way!

846
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,620
I'll shrink it.

847
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:26,998
Are you looking for this?

848
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,460
- Give it to me!
- No.

849
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:33,130
Oh, really?
You'd rather get squished?

850
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:36,216
Actually, when you put it
like that, er...

851
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:41,513
- I'll handle this.
- You?

852
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:45,934
Sure. He's just a big, friendly,
misunderstood guy.

853
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:49,229
Look deep into my eyes.

854
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:56,653
Oh, darn it.

855
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:00,991
You are powerless
against my words.

856
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:03,076
You will submit to my...

857
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:05,620
Oh, dear.

858
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,671
So, you like music?

859
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,924
What? You don't like my moves?

860
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,475
Your sister's crazy.

861
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:30,687
Sometimes I think I'm the only
normal one in my family.

862
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:34,107
Sorry, hairball.

863
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,820
It's the rhythm of the island

864
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:41,781
I like the sugarcane so sweet

865
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:46,745
if you want to do the monster

866
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:48,997
you've got to listen to the beat

867
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:54,419
I guess that's why
he's called king conga.

868
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,173
Uff da?

869
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,136
You're not enjoying yourself,
are you?

870
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:05,263
Maybe.

871
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,849
Hey, we've found something
you're not good at!

872
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:11,019
And you could do it better,
pizza boy?

873
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:14,940
- You tell me.
- You are all crazy!

874
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:18,026
Everybody gather round now

875
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:20,528
let your body feel the heat

876
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:25,742
don't you worry
if you can't dance

877
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:28,620
let the music move your feet

878
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:33,541
it's the rhythm of the island

879
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:36,211
I like the sugarcane so sweet

880
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,213
monster beat.

881
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,984
- Fay.
- Yes?

882
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:00,986
You were great back there.

883
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:04,072
I danced, mum.
Anyone can do that.

884
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,491
You knew how to connect
with a gorilla.

885
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:09,202
Not everyone can do that.

886
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,662
Yeah.

887
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:13,164
I guess I just knew
what he was feeling.

888
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:15,917
And you didn't need me
or dad to tell you what to do.

889
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:19,337
That's why we don't watch
your every move.

890
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,715
We trust you
to find your own way.

891
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:26,094
You know, I think I might enjoy
working with animals.

892
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:30,140
Maybe I could become a vet
or even a scientist

893
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,101
and discover unknown species,
like king conga!

894
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,688
Sounds sort of sciencey though.

895
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,857
You might have to stay
in school for that.

896
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,067
You know what?

897
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,487
Maybe I will.

898
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,076
What's wrong?

899
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,792
I have never had so much fun.

900
01:03:57,876 --> 01:04:00,712
You know fun is supposed
to make you happy, right?

901
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,882
Do other families
have fun together?

902
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:06,009
Sure, that's what family is.

903
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,094
A group of people who annoy you

904
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:12,265
and make you laugh equally.

905
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:22,192
I'm pretty sure my parents
have never made me laugh.

906
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,028
So, what do they do?

907
01:04:26,071 --> 01:04:30,742
They educate me in chemistry,
physics, athletics,

908
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:35,455
music, arts, computers,
Chinese, arabic, klingon.

909
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:39,667
Klingon?

910
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:42,379
Well, just in case.

911
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:45,673
And do you want to learn
all that stuff?

912
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:50,011
I have to be perfect,
so they're proud of me.

913
01:04:50,095 --> 01:04:52,097
Don't you want your parents
to be proud of you?

914
01:04:54,391 --> 01:04:57,519
But they are,
even when I mess up.

915
01:04:58,353 --> 01:05:00,939
Ok, maybe not so much
when I lose my trousers.

916
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,484
But mostly, yes.

917
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:11,699
My parents want my performance
to be absolutely perfect.

918
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,829
And even then, I'm not sure
it's enough to make them proud.

919
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:34,514
You're ok, pizza boy.
You know that?

920
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,725
You're not so bad yourself.

921
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:45,984
She's already five hours,
23 minutes and 46 seconds

922
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:47,360
behind schedule!

923
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:51,990
- Forty-nine, 50, 51...
- Let's see where she is.

924
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,703
Drone, locate Mila.

925
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:00,748
She's holding hands
with a monster?

926
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:04,669
I'd say that was just
an exceptionally hairy boy.

927
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,255
How many times have I told her

928
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:10,175
not to waste time
on other children?

929
01:06:10,258 --> 01:06:12,260
I'm sure it's nothing.

930
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:16,764
How can it be nothing?
She's with a boy! A hairy one!

931
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:19,976
Who knows what ideas
he'll put into her head!

932
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:24,105
Don't worry. I'll deal with it.

933
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,320
Mila! Finally.

934
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,614
You're mad at me for being late,
aren't you?

935
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,908
I'm sorry, I can explain.

936
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:20,411
No, something has happened.
Something terrible.

937
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:22,997
What? Where's mum?

938
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:25,708
Mum is sick, Mila. Very sick.

939
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:26,918
- I'm on my way.
- Wait.

940
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:30,046
You're the only one
who can save her.

941
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:31,339
What do you mean?

942
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:34,801
The machine is our only hope
to save your mother,

943
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:38,137
but we need all five monsters
to make it work.

944
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:41,474
You have to bring back
the giant ape immediately.

945
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:44,602
Hurry, Mila.
Every second counts.

946
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:08,626
Mum, please be ok.

947
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:13,631
Dad, I've got him!

948
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,050
Excellent, Mila.
Put him over there.

949
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:19,596
I'm sorry.

950
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:55,590
Mum?

951
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,911
I just hope
you weren't too late.

952
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,372
We're the starrs.

953
01:09:27,455 --> 01:09:28,748
We're the starrs.

954
01:09:29,457 --> 01:09:32,293
We're the starrs.
We're the starrs!

955
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:34,379
We're the...

956
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,632
Starrs?

957
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:41,552
We make the world
a better place.

958
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,639
Uff da, uff da, uff da.

959
01:09:44,722 --> 01:09:46,683
Uff da, uff da, uff da.

960
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:49,227
Uff da, uff da, uff da!

961
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,979
King conga's gone.

962
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:54,399
So has your girlfriend.

963
01:09:54,482 --> 01:09:57,694
I thought I knew her.
I thought I could trust her.

964
01:09:57,777 --> 01:09:59,320
I... I thought...

965
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:01,989
She really liked you?

966
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:04,409
Welcome to your teens, kid.

967
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:07,328
We have to stop her, for good.

968
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:12,375
Mum! You're ok.

969
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,837
Of course I am.

970
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:19,173
Then, who is that.

971
01:10:20,758 --> 01:10:22,343
That's Mila.

972
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:26,431
- But I'm Mila.
- You are Mila 1.0.

973
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:28,725
This is your replacement,
Mila 2.0.

974
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:30,309
I don't understand.

975
01:10:30,393 --> 01:10:32,478
You've been made obsolete.

976
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,896
Obsolete?

977
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:38,901
We haven't been completely
honest with you, Mila.

978
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:42,697
Our research failed.

979
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,532
The life energy
of immortal beings

980
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:46,784
can't make humans live longer.

981
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:49,203
We found that out
a long time ago.

982
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:53,082
We had hoped we'd be able
to make ourselves immortal.

983
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:55,084
After all, it wouldn't be fair

984
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,837
to deprive the world
of our genius.

985
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,133
So, our next plan
was for our brilliance

986
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:05,344
to live on
through our offspring.

987
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,889
Offspring? You mean me?

988
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:12,810
In you, we wanted to create
the perfect child.

989
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:18,524
Unfortunately, you proved
to be less than satisfactory.

990
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:21,694
But we starrs never give up.

991
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,906
We discovered
that immortal energy can be used

992
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,158
to bring life to the inanimate.

993
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:30,119
You made a robot
and brought it to life?

994
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:32,079
Don't call your sister a robot.

995
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:34,707
She is everything we wished for.

996
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,001
She is perfect.

997
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:39,003
But what about me?

998
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:40,797
What about you?

999
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,757
I'm your daughter.

1000
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,386
Ok, that's another
teeny white lie.

1001
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:49,764
You're not actually
our daughter.

1002
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:54,143
You're an orphan, selected
for your neural capacity.

1003
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:56,312
We acquired you.

1004
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,065
You're not my real parents?

1005
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:01,734
We are the starrs.

1006
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,861
And you are not.

1007
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:07,156
Get rid of her.

1008
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,617
Yes, mother. With pleasure.

1009
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:34,225
Sorry, but I can
only see clouds.

1010
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:37,895
- Come on, Max. Concentrate.
- I am.

1011
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:40,189
So, the one time
you have to find Mila,

1012
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:42,400
you can't actually
think about her?

1013
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,402
I can think about her.

1014
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:46,779
I'm thinking
about how she lied to me

1015
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,781
and got me to feel sorry
for her,

1016
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,242
and made me feel feelings
for her,

1017
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:53,452
just so she could trick me.

1018
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:56,497
Believe me, fay,
she is all I'm thinking about.

1019
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,209
So, do you think you could do
the teleport spell?

1020
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:02,336
- Mum!
- Uff da.

1021
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:05,256
It's our only chance
to find Mila.

1022
01:13:05,339 --> 01:13:09,302
But the last time I did it,
I nearly drowned us all.

1023
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,221
So, we'll just call that
a practice run.

1024
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:16,601
Max, you can do this!
You have to.

1025
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:27,904
Where are we?

1026
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,365
Exactly where we need to be.

1027
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:32,700
You have got to help me.

1028
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:35,036
Forget it, Mila.
I'm not falling for that again.

1029
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:36,787
The starrs are insane.

1030
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:38,539
You're just working
that out now?

1031
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:40,374
Your family is crazy!

1032
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:44,045
They're not my family.
We were never a family.

1033
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:48,633
They bought me to turn me
into something... perfect.

1034
01:13:48,716 --> 01:13:49,800
What?

1035
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,719
But I couldn't be
perfect enough.

1036
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:56,432
And now they don't want me
anymore.

1037
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:57,934
I've got no one.

1038
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:01,604
That's not true. You've got me.

1039
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:03,522
You've got all of us.

1040
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:11,197
Uff da.

1041
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:26,128
So, we're back to believing
the crazy girl?

1042
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:28,422
Am I the only one
who has a problem with that?

1043
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:32,760
I know I don't deserve it,
but you have to believe me.

1044
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,680
And we've got to get away
from here right now.

1045
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:37,264
Or what?

1046
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:40,226
Or that.

1047
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:43,980
There are two of you now?

1048
01:14:44,063 --> 01:14:46,440
She is nothing like me.

1049
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,492
- Who was that?
- An artificial life form.

1050
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:59,662
My parents... the people
I thought were my parents

1051
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:02,373
used monster energy
to bring her to life.

1052
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,333
I thought I was helping
the world.

1053
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,252
Turns out I was...

1054
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:08,045
Making my own replacement.

1055
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:12,758
Sorry to interrupt.
I just couldn't wait.

1056
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:15,052
I will not let you
hurt my friends.

1057
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:34,447
Now we'll see
who's the better one.

1058
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,923
What's happened? Where are you?

1059
01:15:55,634 --> 01:15:57,094
I'm on your left.

1060
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,681
Watch out,
I'm coming from the right.

1061
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,729
Just kidding this time.

1062
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:18,741
Max!

1063
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,743
Stop that lift!

1064
01:16:39,887 --> 01:16:42,223
Max? What are you doing?

1065
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,933
Saving you!

1066
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,309
Got you.

1067
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:47,228
Not to sound ungrateful,

1068
01:16:47,311 --> 01:16:49,772
but I think
we're still going to die.

1069
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:52,191
- Listen.
- I am so, so sorry!

1070
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:53,984
I shouldn't have taken
your friends.

1071
01:16:54,068 --> 01:16:55,861
- I should have listened to you!
- Mila!

1072
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:57,905
I'll never, ever call you
pizza boy again,

1073
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,407
and not just because
we're about to be squished.

1074
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:02,451
- Mila!
- Yes?

1075
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:05,037
We are not going to die.

1076
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:06,789
Disappear, pronto!

1077
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:14,004
Ok, that didn't quite go
according to plan!

1078
01:17:14,088 --> 01:17:17,925
- You can do magic?
- Not as well as I'd hoped!

1079
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:22,680
You again?

1080
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:33,232
Disappear, pronto!

1081
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,483
Huh?

1082
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:37,778
Disappear, pronto!

1083
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,451
Disappear, pronto!

1084
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,138
Disappear, pronto!

1085
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:16,192
Oh, no!

1086
01:18:18,110 --> 01:18:19,528
Disappear, pronto!

1087
01:18:23,449 --> 01:18:25,534
The amulet's losing power!

1088
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,456
- Max, close your eyes.
- Huh?

1089
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:33,459
Please, just do it.

1090
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:36,712
Think of your family.

1091
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:38,797
Think of what you have to lose

1092
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:41,467
and imagine
being back with them.

1093
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,442
Disappear, pronto.

1094
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:03,155
Mila! It worked!

1095
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,741
Oh, Max! Thank goodness!

1096
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:09,161
We're finally together again.

1097
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:13,499
Uff da.

1098
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,417
The curse is lifting!

1099
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:28,681
Er, is anyone else
still a monster?

1100
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:31,433
I don't understand.
Why didn't it work?

1101
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:33,602
Maybe one of us isn't happy.

1102
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,605
Max? What is it?

1103
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:41,610
I'm sorry. How can I be happy
when Mila doesn't have anyone?

1104
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:46,323
Don't be sorry. It shows
what a caring person you are.

1105
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,159
Uff da.

1106
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:57,793
There they are. The lovebirds.

1107
01:19:57,876 --> 01:20:00,045
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1108
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,797
You're just a machine.

1109
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,134
You're obsolete, Mila 1.0.

1110
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:07,219
Her name is Mila!

1111
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,307
You're coming to live with us.

1112
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,392
After all I've done to you?

1113
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:17,604
Look into my eyes.

1114
01:20:17,688 --> 01:20:21,191
That doesn't work on me.
I am perfect.

1115
01:20:23,152 --> 01:20:24,820
And I can't feel pain.

1116
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,909
I'm to bring the monsters
to my creators.

1117
01:20:42,254 --> 01:20:44,298
I am stronger than he is.

1118
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:47,176
Uff da.

1119
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:50,721
That means he forgives you.
We all do.

1120
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,556
Uff da.

1121
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,142
So, you crashed a wedding

1122
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:57,811
and kidnapped
the bride and groom.

1123
01:20:57,895 --> 01:21:01,940
It's ok.
Everyone makes mistakes.

1124
01:21:02,024 --> 01:21:05,027
Except our little starr.

1125
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,945
You cannot beat me.

1126
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:08,655
I am perfect.

1127
01:21:19,124 --> 01:21:20,918
Fay! Stop!

1128
01:21:47,486 --> 01:21:51,407
Ah! More monsters.
What a thoughtful present.

1129
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,410
I'm so sorry.

1130
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,578
I can't believe
I got it so wrong.

1131
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,957
It's ok to make mistakes.

1132
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,668
Even mistakes as big as mine?

1133
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:05,045
Nobody's perfect.

1134
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:10,467
You really are the best family
in the world.

1135
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:17,766
Not now! I need the werewolf!

1136
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,102
This is not a good time
to be happy!

1137
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:23,522
I'm unhappy. I'm unhappy.
I'm, er...

1138
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,191
Who am I kidding?

1139
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,992
Best family in the world!
Ridiculous!

1140
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:19,745
Look at these sorry excuses
for human beings.

1141
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,581
How can you stand people
like that?

1142
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:25,292
You're right! Max isn't perfect,

1143
01:23:25,751 --> 01:23:27,961
and that's exactly why
I like him.

1144
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:29,171
Incredible!

1145
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,797
I bet none of them even have

1146
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:34,051
a basic grasp
of quantum mechanics.

1147
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:36,720
They've got the shrink ray.

1148
01:23:36,803 --> 01:23:38,388
This could be our chance.

1149
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:41,600
Mila 2.0, get rid of them.

1150
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:43,894
Time to go.

1151
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:45,854
Er, wait!

1152
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:54,905
Nobody's perfect,

1153
01:23:54,988 --> 01:23:57,783
and the sooner we realise that,
the happier we'll all be.

1154
01:23:58,367 --> 01:24:00,202
We don't need to dress
like someone else

1155
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:01,537
to impress people.

1156
01:24:01,620 --> 01:24:03,705
We're all ok
just the way we are.

1157
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:05,958
And that's what makes
life interesting.

1158
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,379
Perfect... is boring.

1159
01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:12,381
What nonsense!

1160
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:16,343
Only those who are perfect
will be liked by others.

1161
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:20,514
I am perfect.

1162
01:24:20,973 --> 01:24:23,016
I don't want to be perfect
at all.

1163
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:25,269
Correct. And you never will be.

1164
01:24:25,352 --> 01:24:27,229
You're full of flaws.

1165
01:24:27,938 --> 01:24:29,690
And that's what makes me human.

1166
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:36,405
I... I need more time.

1167
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:42,077
I'm only human

1168
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,122
of flesh and blood I'm made

1169
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:48,125
ooh!

1170
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:01,847
I'm only human

1171
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,891
of flesh and blood I'm made

1172
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,605
I'm only human

1173
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:13,609
born to make mistakes

1174
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:16,695
of flesh and blood I'm made

1175
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:19,281
I'm only human

1176
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:24,911
of flesh and blood I'm made

1177
01:25:24,995 --> 01:25:27,623
I'm only human

1178
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,627
what are you doing?

1179
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,462
Finally having fun!

1180
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:37,466
- That is awful.
- No, it's beyond awful.

1181
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,803
Having fun? It is so, so...

1182
01:25:41,887 --> 01:25:44,473
Born to make mistakes

1183
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:47,142
- ordinary.
- Human.

1184
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:49,519
I'm only human

1185
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:52,356
of flesh and blood I'm made

1186
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,527
I'm only human

1187
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:01,531
born to make mistakes

1188
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:02,991
you finally made it!

1189
01:26:03,075 --> 01:26:05,661
- I'm only human
- quickly! Over here!

1190
01:26:05,744 --> 01:26:08,830
Of flesh and blood I'm made

1191
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:13,543
I'm only human

1192
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:19,299
darling!

1193
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:20,926
Let our friends go!

1194
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:22,469
Never.

1195
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:24,971
Get off me!

1196
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,566
Stop! What are you doing?

1197
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,611
I am going to shrink all of you!

1198
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:44,616
You shrunk my parents!

1199
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:47,828
And now it's your turn!

1200
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:50,622
Keep still!

1201
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:57,254
- We have to free the monsters.
- Quickly!

1202
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,923
- What about Max?
- We believe in him.

1203
01:27:00,006 --> 01:27:01,925
He'll do it, somehow.

1204
01:27:02,592 --> 01:27:06,096
You cannot hit me. I am perfect!

1205
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:09,808
- We have to open the tanks!
- Yes! But how?

1206
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,185
Just push all the buttons!

1207
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:14,438
But what if we push a wrong one?

1208
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:17,315
Oh, they only have
self-destruct buttons in movies.

1209
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:20,402
I hope those are not
famous last words!

1210
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,612
Open, you silly thing!

1211
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,115
It worked!

1212
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:37,502
It's me, fay. Your friend.

1213
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:50,265
Uff da!

1214
01:27:58,732 --> 01:28:01,443
H urry,
let's take the starr-copter!

1215
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:03,361
I have to stop them!

1216
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:07,324
Not so fast, miss obsolete.

1217
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:10,660
- Give me your hand!
- No, me first!

1218
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:19,920
We have to hurry!

1219
01:28:23,048 --> 01:28:26,635
Renfield! Snookie-pooks.

1220
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,261
My darling.

1221
01:28:28,345 --> 01:28:31,515
Baba? Renfield? Are you ok?

1222
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:36,353
I think Dracula's
in very good hands here.

1223
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,023
Where am I?

1224
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:47,697
Stop!

1225
01:28:48,865 --> 01:28:50,575
- Shoot her.
- Shoot her.

1226
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:51,785
Which one?

1227
01:28:51,868 --> 01:28:54,788
Her! I'm the real Mila!

1228
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:56,206
She's lying!

1229
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:58,291
No, she's lying!

1230
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,043
Shrink her!

1231
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:02,712
- Come on, Max!
- Come on, pizza boy!

1232
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:07,884
Max, no! It's me. Mila!

1233
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:09,135
Your Mila!

1234
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:13,640
Looks like you're the one
who's obsolete.

1235
01:29:14,641 --> 01:29:16,601
You wouldn't call me pizza boy.

1236
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,649
You will...

1237
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:24,150
Do nothing!

1238
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:27,529
Finally.

1239
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:29,239
Finally what?

1240
01:29:29,322 --> 01:29:33,076
Finally, I will have my revenge
on you all!

1241
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,329
Sorry I asked.

1242
01:29:36,413 --> 01:29:41,793
All you puny humans shall bow
to the prince of darkness!

1243
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:44,671
The count of bats!

1244
01:29:44,754 --> 01:29:48,216
The nightmare of nightmares!
The most beautiful...

1245
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:49,926
- Beautiful?
- Hmm?

1246
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:51,678
Really?

1247
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:54,306
Yes, beautiful.

1248
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:56,892
I guess beauty lies
in the eye of the beholder.

1249
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,436
Whatever, sister.

1250
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:01,396
The most beautiful creature
of the night!

1251
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:04,399
The ruler of transylvania!
The king of the world!

1252
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:06,276
The master of the universe!

1253
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:09,070
What the...?

1254
01:30:09,154 --> 01:30:11,823
What's happened to you?
Why are you so big now?

1255
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:15,243
Listen to me. Obey your ruler.

1256
01:30:15,327 --> 01:30:17,495
That's enough!

1257
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:19,998
My big hero!

1258
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:24,461
- You're safe now.
- Uff da!

1259
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:27,130
Yes! I was about to say
the same thing!

1260
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:29,466
Give me that!

1261
01:30:33,470 --> 01:30:35,722
Torture! I hate disco!

1262
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,354
King conga, no!

1263
01:30:48,568 --> 01:30:49,819
The lab's falling apart!

1264
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:55,659
We have to run!
Everyone, get to the lift!

1265
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:00,872
Max, come in!

1266
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:04,042
Mila, we have to...

1267
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,210
Mila?

1268
01:31:06,169 --> 01:31:08,421
- You go ahead!
- Not without you!

1269
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:17,681
- I need to save her!
- I know!

1270
01:31:21,267 --> 01:31:23,395
Come on!
I'll help you out of here.

1271
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:25,522
Humans.

1272
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:34,531
Mila!

1273
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:38,618
Pizza boy
is not going to make it.

1274
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:40,036
I won't let him die!

1275
01:31:50,255 --> 01:31:53,717
Uh-oh. No, no, no!

1276
01:31:59,222 --> 01:32:00,932
Max, take my hand!

1277
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:05,186
I've got you!

1278
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:07,897
What's going on?

1279
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:11,985
I will end your imperfect life.

1280
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:15,405
Max, you need to guide us
out of here.

1281
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:19,576
Ok. Straight ahead.

1282
01:32:20,577 --> 01:32:22,078
Accelerate!

1283
01:32:24,706 --> 01:32:25,749
Which way now?

1284
01:32:25,832 --> 01:32:28,668
You know how sometimes you have
a problem with left and right?

1285
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:31,379
Max, I can do it. Left or right?

1286
01:32:31,463 --> 01:32:34,299
Left. Or the other left.

1287
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:36,843
- To the right?
- To the left!

1288
01:32:41,473 --> 01:32:43,725
Right! Left!

1289
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:47,562
Right!

1290
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:52,108
And again, to the right!

1291
01:32:56,112 --> 01:33:01,159
Those crazy, imperfect children
are going to crash into us!

1292
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:02,327
Duck!

1293
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:11,628
Yay! Yes, yes, yes!

1294
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:20,637
I guess I know my left
from right after all.

1295
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:23,223
How did you know that
I would get it right this time?

1296
01:33:23,306 --> 01:33:25,016
The starrs never believed
in you,

1297
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:26,684
so you doubted yourself.

1298
01:33:27,685 --> 01:33:29,479
That's why you always
got it wrong.

1299
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:32,941
But you believe in me.

1300
01:33:34,984 --> 01:33:38,571
With my life, completely.

1301
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:44,035
Well, it's about time.

1302
01:34:07,517 --> 01:34:08,810
Will you,

1303
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:14,524
wilberforce renfield,
take this woman,

1304
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:16,734
baba yaga,

1305
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:19,404
to be your wedded wife,

1306
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:21,614
to love her,

1307
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:23,950
comfort her,

1308
01:34:24,826 --> 01:34:26,327
honour and keep her...

1309
01:34:27,912 --> 01:34:29,873
In sickness and in health?

1310
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:32,167
I do.

1311
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,920
Will you, baba yaga,
take this man

1312
01:34:36,004 --> 01:34:38,006
to be your wedded husband,

1313
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:42,760
to love him, comfort him
in sickness and in health?

1314
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:45,847
Doing, I am!

1315
01:34:46,764 --> 01:34:48,391
Oh, I want something
just like this

1316
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:58,776
I want something just like this

1317
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,619
I've been reading books of old

1318
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:09,954
the legends and the myths

1319
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:12,415
the testaments they told

1320
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:14,667
the moon and its eclipse

1321
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:19,589
and Superman unrolls
a suit before he lifts

1322
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:22,175
but I'm not the kind of person

1323
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:23,593
that it fits

1324
01:35:23,676 --> 01:35:26,179
she said where'd you wanna go?

1325
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:28,139
How much do you wanna risk?

1326
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:33,186
I'm not looking for somebody
with some superhuman gifts

1327
01:35:33,269 --> 01:35:37,899
some superhero,
some fairy-tale bliss

1328
01:35:37,982 --> 01:35:42,153
just something I can turn to,
somebody I can miss

1329
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:45,365
I want something just like this

1330
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:49,202
mortal fools.

1331
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:51,663
They're no match for my cunning.

1332
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:56,376
I will bide my time and then,
when they least expect it,

1333
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:59,963
the prince of darkness
will rise again!

1334
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:13,142
Rennie, my bubla.

1335
01:36:13,226 --> 01:36:16,521
Have you remembered
to be feeding Dracula?

1336
01:36:16,604 --> 01:36:19,732
Making the weird noises,
he is again.

1337
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:23,194
Sorry, my little snookie-pooks.

1338
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:24,904
I almost forgot.

1339
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:33,454
Mm, black pudding.
My favourite! Hmm.

1340
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:38,736
Sapex scripts
