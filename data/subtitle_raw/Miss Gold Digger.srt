<i>Cinderella.</i>

00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,934
<i>She lived on easy street</i>

00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:44,637
<i>And Juliet.</i>
<i>She had a man to love for life.</i>

<i>I'm not too picky</i>

10
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,039
<i>My right guy's 100 things.</i>
<i>No, I'm not picky at all.</i>

11
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:21,645
<i>There are only 100 things</i>
<i>I want from a man.</i>

12
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:27,414

<i>Miss Gold Digger</i>

16
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,939
Aren't they pretty?

17
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:30,811
'Oh, my beautiful princess,
open your eyes.'

18
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:36,513
Look at her.
She's like an angel.

19
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:42,822
She's so good with children.

20
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:46,022
I'd love her to be
my daughter-in-law.

21
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,828
- If I had a son!
- I told you.

22
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,230
Father?

23
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,434
Good?

24
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:03,039
<i>Name's LEE Jun-seo.</i>
<i>He's loaded.</i>

25
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,118
<i>Not so cute.</i>

26
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:10,313
<i>In fact, cheesy and ugly.</i>

27
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,816
<i>But he's rich.</i>
<i>That's what counts.</i>

28
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,034
This is my room.

29
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,417
Let me be frank with you.

30
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:44,311
I don't see myself
getting married.

31
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:51,022
If it weren't for my parents,
I would've become a nun.

32
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:55,628
I wanted to become a Father, too.

33
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,434
I'm sure you would've made
a fine Father.

34
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:08,139
If so, I wouldn't be here
with you today.

35
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,010
Right?

36
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:27,226
It looks shabby, doesn't it?

37
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:33,437
I'll have this place remodeled
once I get married.

38
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,939
It's weird.

39
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:50,118
When I first saw you,
I felt like I'd known you.

40
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,218
Never felt this way
about anybody.

41
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,632
You're the first, Mi-su.

42
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,038
I'm sorry.

43
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,733
I can wait.

44
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:43,233
<i>All he needs is some style.</i>

45
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:46,140

<i>Just pass the Bar,</i>

00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,338
<i>and I'll grant you your wish.</i>

47
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,613
Yoon-cheol!

48
00:05:58,558 --> 00:05:59,923
You okay?

49
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:02,527
Why follow me around?

50
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,926
You can't win my heart
by doing so!

51
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,430
Mi-su.

52
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:14,233
Even death can't stop me
from loving you.

53
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:33,424
Your feet will hurt
if shoe strings are loose.

54
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,823
This is it.

55
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:40,728
If you fail the Bar again,
we're done.

56
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,132
Tired of waiting, Mi-su?

57
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,244
I'm not your girl...

58
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,744
...until you become a D.A.

59
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,614
Okay?

60
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,224
I love you, Mi-su.

61
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,022
<i>Fine.</i>

62
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:12,825
<i>It'll be like growing</i>
<i>vegetables for myself.</i>

63
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:35,313
God...

64
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,219
Hold it, hold it...

65
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,111
Mom? Mom?

66
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,319
Where is she?

67
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,216
Coming!

68
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,227
What can I do for you?

69
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,639
You think I did this?

70
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,509
Oh my...

71
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,217
Look at my fragile arms.

72
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,224
I'm not strong enough
to break it.

73
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:51,823
Why would you think
it was me?

74
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:55,832
Look at me.
I'm not the lying type.

75
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:00,938
Can you say that
to the police?

76
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,836
Are you threatening me?

77
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:07,946
You have no proof!

78
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,206
He's my witness.

79
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:23,217
There's nothing worse
than lying.

80
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:28,026
Stop lying to your dad.

81
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:31,625
Or you'll end up in hell.

82
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,534
I'm not his dad.

83
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:38,733
Mom...

84
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,519
Why are you crying?

85
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,021
I didn't say anything bad.

86
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,625
Help me here!

87
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,725
I will.

88
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,832
But I've lived here
for 20 years.

89
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,731
You have?
Okay.

90
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:16,339
We have a girl here
with an announcement.

91
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:26,619
I'm SHIN Mi-su
living at 103-805.

92
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:32,329
<i>Today, I broke a flowerpot</i>
<i>and ran.</i>

93
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,129
<i>And I got caught.</i>

94
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:42,036
<i>Many residents have fallen</i>
<i>victims to vandalism lately.</i>

95
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:45,439
Perpetrators out there,
turn yourselves in.

96
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,645
Happy?

97
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,021
All of his friends are doctors.

98
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,819
Hook up with them
at my wedding.

99
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,124
- Really?
- Mi-su, okay?

100
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,827
Congratulations, Young-mi.

101
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:13,029
I hope
you never get divorced.

102
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:14,937
Hey!

103
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:19,840
Think about it.
She's rushing into it.

104
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,244
Once you get hitched,
that's it.

105
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,911
Few people consider themselves
happy in marriage.

106
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:32,616
On top of that,
some doctors are psychos.

107
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:36,216
And a lot of them do drugs.

108
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,327
Right?

109
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,233
Let's go have fun!

110
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,514
Ready, girls?

111
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:06,522
OK!

112
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,218
Thanks for saving my spot.

113
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:08,609
<i>Guys still dig you, Mi-su.</i>

114
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,433
OK!

115
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,132
God, they're so cheap.

116
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,336
It's a deal.

117
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,532
Working through lunch?

118
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,437
You scared me.

119
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,239
I'm on a diet.

120
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,908
You should be the last
to be on a diet.

121
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:45,213
Any idea what it feels like
to have a killer body?

122
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:59,534
Isn't it too negative
toward the competitors?

123
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,736
It's kill or be killed.

124
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:07,835
What if it gets us in trouble?

125
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:13,211
If it does,
we'll find a way to fix it.

126
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,721
That's the spirit, Mi-su.

127
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:28,823
Hi, Jun-seo.
I'm in a meeting.

128
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,436
I'll call you back.

129
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:38,637
Show me
what they don't like.

130
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,926
I can't take it.

131
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,328
It's nothing.

132
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,426
I know.

133
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,936
It may be nothing to you,

134
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,537
but not to me.

135
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:17,416
I just want to make you happy.

136
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:27,421
Jun-seo...

137
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,112
<i>This is it?</i>

138
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:59,313
You're a blessing
from the Virgin Mary.

139
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,524
And that is a blessing
for a couple.

140
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,225
It will connect our love.

141
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:13,434
Thanks so much.

142
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,209
Hello?

143
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,022
Yes?

144
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,218
Who?

145
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,139
You're wasting your time.

146
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,744
I'm spoken for.

147
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,808
By only two!

148
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,809
You know what?
I like you.

149
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,219
So let's go steady.

150
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:46,026
You do your thing.
I'll do mine.

151
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:47,832
Okay?

152
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,624
<i>This is no joke.</i>

153
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,530
<i>I like all three of them.</i>

154
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,618
Mi-su, thanks for drinks.
You're cool.

155
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:47,622
Be careful.

156
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,727
- You're good!
- Bye.

157
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,329
So sexy!

158
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,328
Buy us drinks again!

159
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:57,026
Champagne will be good!

160
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,036
I'm not your bank!

161
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,636
Don't bring them
next time.

162
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:10,506
It's tiring to keep a puppy.

163
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,835
Let me go.

164
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,124
I apologized, didn't I?

165
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,727
Here's what you ate
yesterday.

166
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,830
Kimchi, chicken, eel,
beer, whiskey.

167
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,626
You don't chew well,
do you?

168
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,825
I'll pay for the laundry.

169
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:37,936
How much is it?

170
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,834
Feel like going
on the air again?

171
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:46,037
Wash them well like new.

172
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,219
He's such a jerk.
God, this is embarrassing!

173
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,044
<i>Mi-su is Watching</i>

174
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,544
How could you?

175
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:46,830
I wish to live with you
in a place like this.

176
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,735
I wouldn't survive a day.

177
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:56,246
Happiness comes from
petty things.

178
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:01,313
It's what the rich say.

179
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:05,321
To keep the wretched
from killing themselves!

180
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,520
Tell me.

181
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:18,828
If I fail the Bar again,
you'll leave me?

182
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,232
Yes.

183
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,833
That was quick.

184
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:28,434
You know what will happen
if you give up now?

185
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,713
You'll be a bum...

186
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,819
...with nothing but debt
and despair.

187
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:37,717
You'll be a loser
without any friends.

188
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:40,422
Should I go on?

189
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:53,734
Meat will help you focus.

190
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,910
I don't want much.

191
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:11,418
All you need to do is
pass the Bar, okay?

192
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,919
Don't make me leave you.

193
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:26,536
You're not allowed
to eat meat at a temple.

194
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:30,038
This guy did
and got kicked out.

195
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,643
Really?
Hurry finish eating.

196
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,017
Please, forgive him.

197

Please!

198
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,327
It's not his fault.

199
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:53,022
It's all me.
Punish me instead.

She's the manager

Yes, she's a treasure
of our company.

213
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:34,619
Every project she worked on
was successful.

214

218
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,835
- I'll have to reconsider.
- What?

219
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,843
See you around, Ms. SHIN.

220
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,819

221
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,717
Not really.

00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,619

Wait.

224
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,225
Don't get personal.
This is business.

225
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,025
I'm quick on the uptake.

226
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:16,531
You don't know
what I can do.

227
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,830

Hey!

229
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:35,509
He stands unchallenged
in his company.

230
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:40,421
And he has a good rep
in the IT business.

231
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,016
I can't believe
he's still single.

232
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:48,121
Did you see his eyes?
They were sparkling!

233
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,326
He's a freaking meanie!

234
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,733
Why are you looking at me
like that?

235
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,638
It's time you got promoted.

236
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,540
So I could...

237
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:07,115
Words travel fast
in our business.

238
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:10,521
Once you get a bad name...

239
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:14,921
...you go down
into a bottomless pit.

240

248
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:40,440
I grew up like an orphan.

249
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:45,013
My parents were never around.

250
00:29:47,652 --> 00:29:50,416
They never held my hands.

251
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:58,118
I was so scared
when they were home.

252
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:03,132
I was constantly afraid
to mess up...

253
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,434
...and disappoint them.

254
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,739

I feel the same.

260
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,936
He canceled the contract
for personal reasons.

261
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,840
How could he do that?

262
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:56,216
He should put the company
before himself.

263
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:59,118

you pulled stings for me.

How cold you miss

335
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:34,823
If it was a hangover,
I'd be very upset.

00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,832
But I would understand.

337
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:44,630

Can we reschedule
the meeting?

344
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:20,735
I wouldn't agree to that
if I were the client.

353
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:56,135
I'll call the client
and apologize.

I don't buy water anymore.

365
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,724
There's this spring
in the mountain at the back.

366
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,229
It's good for your system.

367
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,925
Check it out.
Or we can go together.

368
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:55,739
I have some ideas
for your ad.

369
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:58,842
Should we discuss it
over drinks?

370
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,607
Hey!

371
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,414
Who do you think you are?
Be a freaking man!

372
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,818
Come on, bring it on!

373
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:23,031
You'll be called
to the resident's meeting.

374
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:28,427
If you miss it,
I'll go to the police.

375
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:37,413
Can you give me a break?

376
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,627
<i>Resident's Meeting</i>

377
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,422
It's a beautiful day.

378
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:56,515
You said you'd do
anything for me, right?

379
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,820
What?

380
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,633
Of course.
Just say it.

381
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:14,039
<i>A restaurant?</i>
<i>He's buying me lunch?</i>

382
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,415
Act like a couple.
We're getting married soon.

383
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:24,113
What?

384
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,317
Let me get it straight.

385
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:29,517
Your younger sister can't
get married before you.

386
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,128
So you lied to your parents
that you have a girl?

387
00:45:32,262 --> 00:45:35,231
Her fiance will be
transferred to China.

388
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:38,633
If not now,
she has to wait for 3 years.

389
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,237
It's none of my business.

390
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:44,238
You tricked me into this.

391
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:47,641
I thought
you wouldn't mind.

392
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,010
What if I say no?

393
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:58,020
If I give you the job?

394
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:05,619
I heard you were good.

395
00:46:07,865 --> 00:46:10,732
3 years is too long
for her to wait.

396
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:13,837
Where are your parents?

397
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:22,543
Dong-hui!

398
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:34,517
Think about it.

399
00:46:34,658 --> 00:46:38,719
I have a career and life here.

400
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:44,225
I can't throw away
everything for a man.

401
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:46,331
You shouldn't.

402
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,244
Why don't you talk to him?

403
00:46:57,047 --> 00:47:00,608
That'll change nothing.

404
00:47:01,752 --> 00:47:04,118
Why'd you wanna marry him?

405
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:14,222
Marriage is about
supporting each other.

406
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:17,029
You didn't think that?

407
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,526
What a fairytale.

408
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,132
Stay out of this.

409
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:27,844
What you're saying
doesn't make any sense.

410
00:47:27,978 --> 00:47:31,607
Why should a girl
sacrifice for a man?

411
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,409
I'm not saying that.

412
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,711
Let's turn the table here.

413
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,720
Can you give up your life
for a girl?

414
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,221
I can.

415
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,221
What?

416
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,826
If I love her,
I can and will.

417
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,743
Food is good here.

418
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,510
Almost as good as yours.

419
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:09,312
- How do you like it?
- It's good.

420
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:11,616
Enjoy it.

421
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:13,620
Oh, sure.

422
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,725
Do you remember?

423
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:21,525
You cried about this fat girl
in the elementary school.

424
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:23,326
Do you know
what his nickname was?

425
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,628
It was a crybaby.

426
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,031
Was it?

427
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,737
You were a crybaby.

428
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:33,733
Try it.

429
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,214
Go ahead.

430
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,214
Here.

431
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:47,719
- Chew it well.
- It's very good.

432
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,926
How long have you dated her?

433
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,136
Not long.

434
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:05,731
Why don't you marry her
soon after your sister?

435
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:07,138
What?

436
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:11,611
She seemed very mature.
I liked her.

437
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:16,108
She's not sleazy, is she?

438
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:20,417
What are you talking about?
She seemed fine.

439
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:23,219
I'm just asking.
You never know.

440
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:28,730
Why twist my words?

441
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,730
I liked her.

442
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:36,034
Give me some more pear.
Pretty good.

443
00:49:37,174 --> 00:49:40,541
Did Daddy ever
bone a fish for you?

444
00:49:40,677 --> 00:49:43,145
Bone a fish my butt.

445
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,010
He never did anything for me.

446
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:50,914
Would you like a DA
for a son-in-law?

447
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:54,217
Why on earth
would a DA marry you?

448
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,723
You'd like that, huh?

449
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,026
Fine, I'll make you
a DA's mother-in-law.

450
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,624
Stop that.

451
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,134
The sacrifice day for your father
is next week.

452
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:11,836
I changed my religion.

453
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:15,843
If you miss it again,

454
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:18,311
I'll kick you out.

455
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,515
Put this in your underwear
and chant like this.

456
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:27,314
Okay?

457
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:30,920
Repeat it 3 times.

458
00:50:33,263 --> 00:50:37,324
With it in your underwear.
Don't be nervous.

459
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:42,329
Good luck.
Go.

460
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,138
If you pass it,
I'll sleep with you.

461
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:47,641
Good luck!

462
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:51,110
Really?

463
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,512
Wish me luck!

464
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:10,522
WCDMA will be the next
generation mobile service.

465
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:12,726
As SHOW, the new brand,
has been launched...

466
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:17,135
...a high-speed data service
is available now.

467
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:21,142
It will help KTF enhance
its position in the business...

468
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:25,112
...and venture out
to the world.

469
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,308
That's all in the brochure
we provided.

470
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,817
Tell us in detail
how you'll set our image.

471
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,428
Of course.
I was about to.

472
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:45,832
Using USIM cards,
it'll offer various services...

473
00:51:45,969 --> 00:51:48,130
...that will change
the mobile life dramatically.

474
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:52,537
We'll show people happily
using SHOW...

475
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:57,204
...saving up to 30%% %
of their phone bills.

476
00:51:57,347 --> 00:52:01,215
The public will see
the new image of KTF...

477
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:05,412
...as an innovative
and leading telecom company.

478
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:10,519
- What do you think?
- I like it.

479
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,631
When can you do it by?

480
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,910
Wait.

481
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,210
Got more to show me?

482
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:40,022
No, it's not that.

483
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:40,919
Bye.

484
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,525
Thank you.

485
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:48,229
If you're free,
I can buy you...

486
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:53,132
What a nice picture!

487
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:55,636
You guys are going out?

488
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,238
- No way!
- This is business.

489
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:04,108
Yes?

490
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:06,215
No.

491
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,718
Now?

492
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,217
Wait!

493
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:19,425
Mi-su, stop sending me
to both heaven and hell.

494
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,835
Sure.

495
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,316
<i>Hey.</i>

496
00:53:46,956 --> 00:53:49,424
<i>Why do you smile all the time?</i>

497
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:12,408
<i>God, this guy is so romantic.</i>

498
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:14,707
<i>But, no.</i>

499
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:17,517
<i>It's too early to fall for him.</i>

500
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:22,416
<i>What if I do?</i>

501
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,028
<i>No, it's too early.</i>

502
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:28,721
<i>I need more time.</i>

503
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:32,028
<i>Be patient, Mi-su.</i>

504
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:40,537
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

505
00:54:40,676 --> 00:54:43,110
<i>No, I should be in control.</i>

506
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,613
Mi-su?

507
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,515
It's a beautiful night.

508
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:57,719
Yes.

509
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:01,830
This is so romantic.

510
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:12,433
<i>Fine, I'll let you kiss me</i>
<i>for trying.</i>

511
00:55:16,345 --> 00:55:21,009
Why does he
wanna work out at night?

512
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,528
What are you doing?

513
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:41,135
No...
I was looking for you.

514
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:43,138
Let's go.

515
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:19,839
Yes, that's right.

516
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:34,719
That's right.
Hold it tight. Good.

517
00:56:35,057 --> 00:56:35,819
Hold it tight.

518
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:37,823
Hold it tight.
Good. Good.

519
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,825
Come on,
give me one more.

520
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:46,532
I'm so tired.

521
00:56:47,069 --> 00:56:50,334
- Tired?
- I might drop dead.

522
00:56:58,147 --> 00:57:00,012
Need a ride?

523
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:02,709
No, I can walk.
You must be tired.

524
00:57:02,852 --> 00:57:06,618
Working and dating...

525
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:09,122
Don't get fresh.

526
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:11,821
Night.

527
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,121
Bye.

528
00:57:17,466 --> 00:57:20,924
He's quite all right.

529
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:28,337
Yeah, I'm tired.
My life is tiring.

530
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,014
Here you go.

531
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:37,119
Enjoy it.

532
00:57:38,654 --> 00:57:39,916
Come here.

533
00:57:42,558 --> 00:57:45,925
Give me some more.
I like sausages.

534
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:49,828
You have to share.
I'll give you more later.

535
00:57:49,965 --> 00:57:52,024
Give me more, Mrs.

536
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:53,528
I'm not Mrs.

537
00:57:53,669 --> 00:57:56,638
Get out of here
before I eat them all.

538
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,831
Next.

539
00:58:10,152 --> 00:58:14,714
With money,
it's easy to be an angel.

540
00:58:17,059 --> 00:58:21,826
Should I dump others
and be a rich angel?

541
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,200
Daddy!

542
00:58:37,947 --> 00:58:39,209
Shoot.

543
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:42,610
I'm sorry.

544
00:58:42,751 --> 00:58:46,209
You should've been careful.
So sorry.

545
00:58:46,355 --> 00:58:47,822
- It's okay.
- You should've been careful.

546
00:58:47,957 --> 00:58:48,924
That's okay.

547
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:51,925
<i>Yeah, there's a poor angel</i>
<i>as well.</i>

548
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:54,621
It's okay. Go play.

549
00:58:54,763 --> 00:58:56,321
Bye.

550
00:58:59,568 --> 00:59:02,230
Look at your shirt.

551
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:05,033
It'll dry soon.

552
00:59:05,374 --> 00:59:07,934
You're almost too good.

553
00:59:08,377 --> 00:59:09,503
Here.

554
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:16,912
<i>He'll forgive me</i>
<i>for whatever I do.</i>

555
00:59:17,953 --> 00:59:19,511
What?

556
00:59:19,655 --> 00:59:24,524
I'd be so happy
if you pass the Bar.

557
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:29,727
I guess
You haven't checked it.

558
00:59:29,865 --> 00:59:31,025
What?

559
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:33,826
What is it?

560
00:59:35,771 --> 00:59:37,329
The result is out?

561
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:42,906
Give it here.
Did you pass it?

562
01:00:10,172 --> 01:00:11,332
Feels so awkward.

563
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:13,134
I like the buttons.

564
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:24,213
This is it.
Now you look like a DA.

565
01:00:24,353 --> 01:00:26,913
Sir, you're due at court.

566
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:30,116
- Stop it.
- This is fun.

567
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:32,420
Let's get this, Mr. DA.

568
01:00:35,564 --> 01:00:40,433
I'm so proud of you.
What do you feel like eating?

569
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,037
Mi-su.

570
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:58,918
I won't be able to come home
for a few days.

571
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:02,916
Take care of the kids.
I'll call you.

572
01:01:03,058 --> 01:01:07,722
Ji-gum is only 1,
and he speaks English.

573
01:01:07,863 --> 01:01:09,626
Teach him Korean first.

574
01:01:09,765 --> 01:01:11,733
Thank God
he's smart after me.

575
01:01:18,173 --> 01:01:20,141
I'll be lonely.

576
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:23,803
I won't be shackled
to the kids, will I?

577
01:01:29,451 --> 01:01:30,816
Hi, Honey.

578
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:37,824
I'm serving food
for the homeless tomorrow.

579
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:42,128
I'm so grateful to have you.

580
01:01:43,065 --> 01:01:48,731
Just pretend you're happy
out there, okay?

581
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:51,837
Thanks, Honey.

582
01:01:58,847 --> 01:02:02,510
Yeah, it'll be tiring.

583
01:02:06,855 --> 01:02:08,220
Sorry.

584
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:12,316
My buddy got fired.
So I took him to a bar.

585
01:02:15,564 --> 01:02:19,523
Why don't they
recognize my talents?

586
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:26,139
Can you help me
put out an album?

587
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:27,833
I'll be good.

588
01:02:27,976 --> 01:02:29,807
Just one album.

589
01:02:31,947 --> 01:02:35,405
What if I lose
all my savings?

590
01:02:45,861 --> 01:02:48,728
What's wrong?
Can't sleep?

591
01:02:50,265 --> 01:02:52,631
Let me hold you.

592
01:02:57,272 --> 01:03:02,209
I must be tired lately.
I'm seeing things.

593
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:08,910
No way.

594
01:03:34,576 --> 01:03:36,601
You would look good
driving it.

595
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:41,810
You can't buy my heart.

596
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:46,810
I couldn't be happier
with you.

597
01:03:48,857 --> 01:03:50,415
Just...

598
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,921
Please, take it.

599
01:03:53,862 --> 01:03:56,023
You don't have to decide now.

600
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:03,432
What I want is you,
not your money.

601
01:04:05,774 --> 01:04:07,036
Mi-su...

602
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,639
Hey, it's me.

603
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:41,443
It's a beautiful day.

604
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,411
Does your mom like fruit?

605
01:04:45,547 --> 01:04:48,209
<i>She's out of town.</i>

606
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:50,614
When will she be back?

607
01:04:50,752 --> 01:04:54,813
You passed the Bar,
but you're not a DA yet.

608
01:04:54,957 --> 01:04:56,117
<i>Go and study.</i>

609
01:04:56,258 --> 01:05:02,822
I get a lot of calls lately
from matchmakers.

610
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,023
Threatening me?

611
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:08,034
No way.
You're the only girl for me.

612
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:10,331
Go study then.

613
01:05:43,972 --> 01:05:45,132
Hi.

614
01:05:51,346 --> 01:05:54,213
You can't have
all the girls on earth.

615
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:57,710
Listen.

616
01:05:57,853 --> 01:06:01,721
She has a great body
with a tight ass.

617
01:06:03,859 --> 01:06:04,917
You slept with her?

618
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:06,527
Of course, I did.

619
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:07,720
No shit.

620
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:09,330
You really screwed her?

621
01:06:09,464 --> 01:06:14,424
She moved her ass like...

622
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:16,530
It was awesome.

623
01:06:19,274 --> 01:06:20,434
What?

624
01:06:22,644 --> 01:06:25,010
Mi-su?

625
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,808
Listen to me.

626
01:06:27,449 --> 01:06:30,509
You asshole!
When'd I sleep with you?

627
01:06:30,652 --> 01:06:33,519
I just wanted to show off.

628
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:35,122
We're a couple anyway.

629
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:36,724
What?

630
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:42,826
Don't ever call me again.

631
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:47,527
Mi-su...

632
01:06:56,244 --> 01:07:02,615
Can you hear me?

633
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:05,619
Please come outside.

634
01:07:05,754 --> 01:07:07,016
Mi-su!

635
01:07:07,155 --> 01:07:09,214
Can you hear me?

636
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,326
I was wrong!

637
01:07:20,068 --> 01:07:23,037
I'm in love with you!

638
01:07:23,171 --> 01:07:26,436
I was wrong.
I love you.

639
01:07:26,575 --> 01:07:29,601
- I'll never do that again!
- What are you doing?

640
01:07:30,245 --> 01:07:31,712
I'm sorry.

641
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:34,213
I won't do it again!

642
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:36,710
I love you!

643
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:39,116
Mi-su, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

644
01:07:56,872 --> 01:08:00,638
Why can't you just
let it go?

645
01:08:01,076 --> 01:08:02,407
I thought you were cool.

646
01:08:02,544 --> 01:08:05,206
It's cool to give up
a woman I love?

647
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:06,905
Is that it?

648
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:09,715
I told you I had a man.

649
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:12,513
What do they have
that I don't?

650
01:08:12,654 --> 01:08:15,316
Money, future, power.

651
01:08:15,457 --> 01:08:17,118
You have nothing.

652
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,818
What about moments
we had together?

653
01:08:22,464 --> 01:08:24,523
What about love we shared?

654
01:08:24,666 --> 01:08:27,533
We're through.

655
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:29,830
There's no way to go back.

656
01:08:33,775 --> 01:08:35,800
Check, please!

657
01:08:38,246 --> 01:08:39,611
Fine.

658
01:08:40,148 --> 01:08:41,809
You gave me no option.

659
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:46,717
I'll send out your pictures.
That I took.

660
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:49,421
What do you have?
My naked body?

661
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:50,820
Yes.

662
01:08:54,162 --> 01:08:58,428
I took them for my eyes.

663
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:02,525
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>He seems serious.</i>

664
01:09:04,072 --> 01:09:08,338
We can talk about it
over drinks.

665
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:10,104
Go ahead.

666
01:09:10,245 --> 01:09:12,611
What pictures are they?

667
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:14,909
- Don't know.
- Go ahead.

668
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,211
I was just concerned.

669
01:09:32,467 --> 01:09:34,025
<i>There was time...</i>

670
01:09:34,669 --> 01:09:39,038
<i>... when I thought</i>
<i>love was everything.</i>

671
01:10:15,343 --> 01:10:19,712
<i>Pictures are not only</i>
<i>to look at but to erase.</i>

672
01:10:23,952 --> 01:10:29,015
<i>I'll let you go now.</i>
<i>Go back to your world.</i>

673
01:11:09,664 --> 01:11:12,224
How many guys
are you seeing?

674
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:14,330
What?

675
01:11:14,769 --> 01:11:17,829
Mind your own business.

676
01:11:21,376 --> 01:11:24,106
Are you a stalker?
Why keep bumping into me?

677
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:27,306
You're sick.

678
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:29,917
Keep talking.

679
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:32,611
You love them all?

680
01:11:34,756 --> 01:11:36,519
Do you know what love is?

681
01:11:37,058 --> 01:11:38,320
Of course.

682
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,228
What do you think it is?

683
01:11:41,363 --> 01:11:43,627
Why should I answer it?

684
01:11:43,765 --> 01:11:48,031
You should love yourself
to love others.

685
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:49,434
What?

686
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:53,632
You should be honest
with yourself...

687
01:11:53,775 --> 01:11:56,209
...to give anybody love.

688
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:59,213
Who are you to judge me?

689
01:12:00,548 --> 01:12:04,211
Do you even know
what your type is?

690
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:09,121
I'll rent a car
until it's fixed.

691
01:12:09,257 --> 01:12:11,521
And if I feel sick,
I'll go to the hospital.

692
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,920
Why so angry with me?

693
01:12:16,164 --> 01:12:17,825
Why live like that?

694
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,431
Who made you this way?

695
01:12:56,771 --> 01:12:58,534
What the...

696
01:12:59,774 --> 01:13:01,833
Is it the accident?

697
01:13:15,256 --> 01:13:16,518
Are you hurt?

698
01:13:18,259 --> 01:13:20,625
It's nothing.

699
01:13:21,062 --> 01:13:24,031
Got any news for me?

700
01:13:24,165 --> 01:13:29,125
You know the KTF project
we're working on?

701
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:30,833
What about it?

702
01:13:30,972 --> 01:13:36,308
We're invited to the party
they're hosting.

703
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:39,805
At Hotel Paradise.

704
01:13:40,448 --> 01:13:44,009
Why should we care?

705
01:13:44,152 --> 01:13:46,313
We should!

706
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:50,823
Think of all the clients
we can fish for.

707
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:56,326
Mr. CHOI told me to dress up.

708
01:13:56,464 --> 01:14:01,834
He said I was the mascot
of our company.

709
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:11,610
Nice.

710
01:14:24,959 --> 01:14:29,020
That's 100%% % cashmere.
Pick anything you like.

711
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:31,325
It's on me.

712
01:14:33,768 --> 01:14:39,536
You don't wanna show up
looking shabby at the party.

713
01:14:40,975 --> 01:14:43,910
Still, this is...

714
01:14:44,846 --> 01:14:49,715
If you refuse to take it,
I'll be mad.

715
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,019
Let me help you pick.

716
01:15:38,266 --> 01:15:42,225
It's leather,
and ladies love it.

717
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,316
You look fantastic.

718
01:15:58,953 --> 01:16:05,415
Especially, your arms
and black silk gloves.

719
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:07,623
So beautiful.

720
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:13,924
Why couldn't I see
this side of you earlier?

721
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:20,441
Isn't it small for you?

722
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:22,406
It's the only size we have.

723
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:25,104
- Try something else on.
- No!

724
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:27,510
It fits.

725
01:16:28,449 --> 01:16:30,508
I'll take it.

726
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:33,018
Please, do so.

727
01:16:42,463 --> 01:16:43,930
This...

728
01:16:46,267 --> 01:16:48,633
Perfect.

729
01:16:50,672 --> 01:16:56,406
I'll sign with other companies
and dump thatjerk.

730
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:09,012
Don't worry.
I'm the mascot, remember?

731
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:10,818
- Glad you made it.
- Dong-min.

732
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:11,926
Hi.

733
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:14,221
This is a great party.

734
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:18,126
- You think so?
- Sure, it's all great.

735
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:33,812
Hi.

736
01:17:40,755 --> 01:17:41,722
I'm counting on you.

737
01:17:41,856 --> 01:17:43,619
I'll call you next week.

738
01:17:43,758 --> 01:17:45,316
Thanks.

739
01:17:48,162 --> 01:17:51,427
Can you breathe in that?

740
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:55,836
What do you care?

741
01:17:59,974 --> 01:18:01,134
Oh!

742
01:18:03,344 --> 01:18:08,714
I'm here as a guest.
Show me some respect.

743
01:18:20,561 --> 01:18:26,124
I must've gained weight.

744
01:18:32,273 --> 01:18:34,138
Hello?

745
01:18:34,275 --> 01:18:39,110
Going to Daegu?
Anything happened?

746
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:43,313
You're no help.

747
01:18:43,451 --> 01:18:47,217
Okay, have a safe trip.

748
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:09,502
Mi-su, listen to me.

749
01:19:10,244 --> 01:19:12,508
I'm sorry I messed up.

750
01:19:12,647 --> 01:19:14,308
I love you!

751
01:19:15,249 --> 01:19:16,910
Mi-su, I messed up!

752
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:18,416
Mi-su!

753
01:19:18,853 --> 01:19:20,218
- Busan Station, please.
- Don't do this!

754
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:23,722
I love you!
Mi-su!

755
01:19:23,858 --> 01:19:25,223
I love you, Mi-su!

756
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,227
Mi-su! Mi-su!

757
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:40,635
Your father is so patriotic.

758
01:19:40,775 --> 01:19:45,508
He dedicated his life
to bring justice to...

759
01:19:45,646 --> 01:19:47,011
Yoon-cheol?

760
01:19:47,148 --> 01:19:49,616
You have a good taste.

761
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:53,411
What's going on?

762
01:19:54,255 --> 01:19:55,916
Is this Daegu?

763
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:58,316
Who's this chick?

764
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:03,727
What a nice surprise.
How are you?

765
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:06,527
Been a while.

766
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:08,936
What's going on here?

767
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:14,742
She's got a temper.

768
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:18,004
Say hi.
We went to school together.

769
01:20:18,146 --> 01:20:21,809
This is Yu-jin.
She's my girlfriend.

770
01:20:21,949 --> 01:20:23,507
Fucking high?

771
01:20:23,651 --> 01:20:27,417
Why don't you watch
your language?

772
01:20:29,857 --> 01:20:34,419
- She's been always...
- Look.

773
01:20:34,562 --> 01:20:38,623
I'm SHIN Mi-su.
One that you love for life!

774
01:20:39,267 --> 01:20:41,132
Stop it.
It's not funny.

775
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:45,336
She's justjoking.

776
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:48,135
Joking or not,
I don't like it.

777
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:51,303
I have black and silver on.

778
01:20:51,946 --> 01:20:54,107
We're like a couple,
aren't we?

779
01:20:54,248 --> 01:20:55,510
Yeah.

780
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:57,015
Excuse me.

781
01:20:57,552 --> 01:21:00,020
- Where's Mi-su?
- No idea.

782
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:02,315
I'm sorry about this.

783
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:04,425
Wait here.

784
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,626
How could you do this to me?

785
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:10,424
We'll talk outside.

786
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:16,333
I took care of you
when you were struggling.

787
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:18,738
Fine then.

788
01:21:18,873 --> 01:21:20,431
Let's go.

789
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:32,118
How long has it been?

790
01:21:32,253 --> 01:21:33,515
Get off!

791
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:59,309
She was just my junior
in University.

792
01:22:04,652 --> 01:22:05,710
What the hell!

793
01:22:05,853 --> 01:22:07,013
You...

794
01:22:08,756 --> 01:22:09,916
Let me go.

795
01:22:32,146 --> 01:22:33,613
Asshole!

796
01:22:39,954 --> 01:22:42,923
- Who are you?
- You don't need to know.

797
01:22:55,469 --> 01:22:57,733
You are the ones
who stole my Mi-su?

798
01:22:57,872 --> 01:22:59,737
Who are you?

799
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,308
I want my Mi-su back!

800
01:23:11,452 --> 01:23:14,114
You win. You win.

801
01:23:16,557 --> 01:23:18,024
What are you?

802
01:23:26,867 --> 01:23:29,233
Who are you guys?

803
01:23:33,374 --> 01:23:34,739
Get out of here!

804
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:36,399
Who are you?

805
01:24:10,544 --> 01:24:12,512
Don't worry.

806
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:15,013
I'll take care of it.

807
01:24:15,149 --> 01:24:16,810
This place isn't for you.

808
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:18,009
Go home.

809
01:24:18,152 --> 01:24:20,916
Let's go.

810
01:24:21,455 --> 01:24:22,820
I'm counting on you.

811
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:31,721
Why releasing them?
We fought together!

812
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:37,336
Without their kindness,
you would be detained.

813
01:24:39,273 --> 01:24:40,535
Let's go.

814
01:24:52,553 --> 01:24:55,420
He's a soon-to-be DA.

815
01:24:55,556 --> 01:24:59,117
And she's the daughter
of the Attorney General.

816
01:25:19,246 --> 01:25:22,704
The client wants you
off the project.

817
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:26,809
I don't think
it was Dong-min's idea.

818
01:25:28,055 --> 01:25:31,024
At the meeting this afternoon...

819
01:25:31,158 --> 01:25:34,616
they'll decide
what to do with you.

820
01:25:35,262 --> 01:25:40,222
You might as well resign
to save face.

821
01:25:57,151 --> 01:25:59,016
Hi, Jun-seo.

822
01:26:00,354 --> 01:26:03,221
Try them all.
They all taste different.

823
01:26:07,261 --> 01:26:09,525
<i>You're all I have left?</i>

824
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:21,239
Why not eating?

825
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:22,902
Not good?

826
01:26:24,044 --> 01:26:24,908
Is it the smell?

827
01:26:25,045 --> 01:26:28,606
No, it's good.

828
01:26:34,355 --> 01:26:35,720
That's right.

829
01:26:36,157 --> 01:26:43,120
I heard there was a fight
at the party.

830
01:26:44,165 --> 01:26:47,931
I don't know.
I wasn't there.

831
01:26:50,871 --> 01:26:55,808
Mi-su, it tastes better
when eaten with hands.

832
01:27:08,856 --> 01:27:13,316
Good?
This is my favorite restaurant.

833
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:25,534
You know what?

834
01:27:27,274 --> 01:27:30,607
I got dumped here
five times.

835
01:27:32,646 --> 01:27:34,307
Pity me, huh?

836
01:27:35,449 --> 01:27:40,409
<i>Guess you aren't as naive</i>
<i>as I thought.</i>

837
01:27:40,855 --> 01:27:43,221
After the third time,

838
01:27:45,259 --> 01:27:47,318
I took pills.

839
01:27:48,662 --> 01:27:50,630
I wanted to die.

840
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:59,131
I'm glad I survived so
that I met you.

841
01:28:04,245 --> 01:28:06,713
Will you feed me now?

842
01:28:06,847 --> 01:28:07,905
What?

843
01:28:08,048 --> 01:28:09,413
Come on.

844
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:11,617
Go ahead.

845
01:28:14,855 --> 01:28:16,914
Mix it well.

846
01:28:35,342 --> 01:28:41,906
Your hand tastes so good.

847
01:28:44,151 --> 01:28:48,417
It's something
I've never tasted before.

848
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:53,217
Mi-su.

849
01:28:56,463 --> 01:28:58,124
Frankly speaking...

850
01:29:19,553 --> 01:29:21,418
Please, accept my love.

851
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:24,524
I know
you'll understand.

852
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:37,728
God damn it!

853
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:42,105
You're so disgusting!

854
01:29:42,242 --> 01:29:46,303
Go home and lick the doll,
you sick pervert!

855
01:29:49,149 --> 01:29:50,616
Mi-su?

856
01:29:55,055 --> 01:29:56,613
<i>Yes.</i>

857
01:29:56,757 --> 01:30:00,818
<i>He was perverted</i>
<i>with a fetish for hands.</i>

858
01:31:09,863 --> 01:31:11,728
I'll explain later.

859
01:31:12,366 --> 01:31:13,924
Sorry, Daddy.

860
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:10,317
Can I have some egg rolls?

861
01:32:10,457 --> 01:32:11,822
Okay.

862
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:29,402
I know I ruined it
for you.

863
01:32:31,545 --> 01:32:38,007
I'll make it up to you.
Drinks are on me.

864
01:32:38,952 --> 01:32:42,319
One more bottle, please!

865
01:32:43,257 --> 01:32:49,127
There are things
you can never control.

866
01:32:50,564 --> 01:32:56,935
You know what?
Love is one of them.

867
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:06,608
I loved him so much,
but he left me.

868
01:33:08,248 --> 01:33:13,618
It hurt me so much...

869
01:33:14,054 --> 01:33:20,618
...I didn't want to get hurt
ever again.

870
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:25,425
Is that bad?

871
01:33:27,067 --> 01:33:28,534
Why?

872
01:33:29,069 --> 01:33:31,230
Why are you doing this?

873
01:33:31,371 --> 01:33:35,705
Why should we break up?

874
01:33:35,842 --> 01:33:38,811
I did everything for you.

875
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:43,406
I did everything
that made you happy.

876
01:33:44,851 --> 01:33:47,615
Don't do this.

877
01:33:47,754 --> 01:33:50,917
Be cool about it.

878
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:55,426
But why?

879
01:33:55,562 --> 01:33:57,530
You don't know?

880
01:33:57,664 --> 01:34:01,430
You've never been
honest with me.

881
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:13,912
Yeah, I've never been
honest with you.

882
01:34:15,249 --> 01:34:16,910
Whose fault is that?

883
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:18,517
What?

884
01:34:18,652 --> 01:34:20,916
That's my fault?

885
01:34:21,054 --> 01:34:23,420
What the fuck.

886
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:26,424
You wanna go there?

887
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,929
You've never used
the F word before.

888
01:34:31,064 --> 01:34:34,227
Yeah, I have a dirty mouth.

889
01:34:34,368 --> 01:34:37,337
3 bottles of these won't
get me drunk.

890
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:40,440
And I hate shirts like this.

891
01:34:40,574 --> 01:34:46,911
If I had told you
I had dated over 100...

892
01:34:47,047 --> 01:34:48,912
You wouldn't have liked me.

893
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:51,511
Su-han...

894
01:34:52,653 --> 01:34:54,211
This isn't you.

895
01:34:54,354 --> 01:35:00,224
You're innocent and naive.

896
01:35:02,462 --> 01:35:04,828
Damn it.

897
01:35:04,965 --> 01:35:12,030
Because ofjerks like you,
girls have to play innocent.

898
01:35:13,774 --> 01:35:17,710
It's so hard to live
as a girl.

899
01:35:18,345 --> 01:35:23,715
I ended up like this
because of assholes like you!

900
01:35:31,358 --> 01:35:37,024
Why did my father
name me Mi-su?

901
01:35:38,265 --> 01:35:45,103
It means 'lncomplete'.

902
01:35:45,972 --> 01:35:50,500
Whatever I do...

903
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:54,710
It never works out
the way I want it to.

904
01:35:55,449 --> 01:35:58,907
Even love I wish for.

905
01:35:59,252 --> 01:36:02,619
It's always incomplete.

906
01:36:02,756 --> 01:36:05,418
Everything is incomplete for me.

907
01:36:05,559 --> 01:36:07,322
Right?

908
01:36:14,568 --> 01:36:16,934
Daddy!

909
01:36:17,971 --> 01:36:22,704
Daddy, am I heavy?

910
01:36:23,844 --> 01:36:28,713
I grew up
while you were gone.

911
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:33,213
I'm a grown-up now.

912
01:36:35,956 --> 01:36:46,833
I just didn't wanna wind up
with a man like you.

913
01:36:47,367 --> 01:36:52,134
But I miss you so much.

914
01:36:53,173 --> 01:36:59,305
You would've beaten up
those bastards for me.

915
01:37:01,348 --> 01:37:03,714
Daddy...

916
01:37:05,051 --> 01:37:07,110
I'm sorry.

917
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:16,827
You jerk!
Get your hands off my ass!

918
01:37:16,963 --> 01:37:19,227
Stop wigging!

919
01:37:26,173 --> 01:37:32,703
When you beat up
Yoon-cheol for me...

920
01:37:33,747 --> 01:37:35,408
I was grateful.

921
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:39,210
You looked awesome.

922
01:37:40,153 --> 01:37:47,116
Not much of a fighter,
but you did well.

923
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:56,836
What if we didn't get off
on the wrong foot?

924
01:37:58,672 --> 01:38:02,904
Would I have given you
a hug?

925
01:38:04,644 --> 01:38:06,509
Maybe a kiss?

926
01:38:09,549 --> 01:38:17,012
How would your lips feel
on mine?

927
01:38:18,458 --> 01:38:21,518
Stop talking
right to my face.

928
01:38:22,062 --> 01:38:25,429
Bone the fish for me.

929
01:38:35,175 --> 01:38:36,506
I'm closing the account.

930
01:38:37,043 --> 01:38:37,907
You sure?

931
01:38:38,445 --> 01:38:40,709
I need the money
for something.

932
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:44,016
Getting married?

933
01:39:09,643 --> 01:39:11,804
<i>Nothing's perfect.</i>

934
01:39:12,846 --> 01:39:17,408
<i>Men, love and life.</i>
<i>None is perfect.</i>

935
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:21,214
<i>Life is</i>
<i>about satisfying yourself.</i>

936
01:39:22,255 --> 01:39:24,120
<i>So you have to choose.</i>

937
01:39:29,563 --> 01:39:34,830
<i>Yes, life is about taking</i>
<i>chances and making choices.</i>

938
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:48,808
You don't have to do this.

939
01:39:49,649 --> 01:39:52,812
I've always wanted
to go to France.

940
01:39:52,953 --> 01:39:55,217
You can take my position.

941
01:39:57,157 --> 01:40:00,524
I still have a lot to learn
from you.

942
01:40:01,761 --> 01:40:04,229
You'll do well.

943
01:40:07,267 --> 01:40:10,532
What do you mean
you're going to France?

944
01:40:11,571 --> 01:40:14,039
Is this to attract attention?

945
01:40:14,874 --> 01:40:17,001
Is that it?

946
01:40:17,744 --> 01:40:19,712
I guess so.

947
01:40:20,146 --> 01:40:22,114
Is it the party?

948
01:40:22,248 --> 01:40:24,409
You can make up for it.

949
01:40:24,551 --> 01:40:26,416
Don't do this.

950
01:40:27,253 --> 01:40:29,221
Take me back when I come back.

951
01:40:29,356 --> 01:40:32,325
Though I might come in late
with a hangover.

952
01:40:32,459 --> 01:40:34,324
SHIN Mi-su!

953
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:38,722
Tell them
that we broke up.

954
01:40:38,865 --> 01:40:43,131
That I'm sleazy
with drinking issues.

955
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:45,934
Who would like such a girl?

956
01:40:46,673 --> 01:40:52,908
If I tell them you're smart,
hard-working, and flexible...

957
01:40:53,046 --> 01:40:54,809
They'll like you.

958
01:40:55,949 --> 01:40:58,315
Thank you
for telling them that.

959
01:40:59,452 --> 01:41:03,821
Why do you have to go?
You can study here.

960
01:41:03,957 --> 01:41:05,925
Begging me to stay?

961
01:41:08,061 --> 01:41:09,528
Should I get on my knees?

962
01:41:11,665 --> 01:41:18,229
Like you once told me,
I don't know what I want.

963
01:41:18,872 --> 01:41:25,004
All I cared about was
how to look to other people.

964
01:41:25,545 --> 01:41:29,311
I want to find myself
before it's too late.

965
01:41:31,851 --> 01:41:33,614
How long should I wait?

966
01:41:46,566 --> 01:41:48,830
I've shopped a lot.

967
01:42:02,148 --> 01:42:04,309
I'll give you a year.

968
01:42:05,251 --> 01:42:09,312
If you're not back by then,
I'll remarry.

969
01:42:10,757 --> 01:42:12,918
That's why I'm leaving.

970
01:42:17,063 --> 01:42:18,826
Thanks, Mom.

971
01:42:19,666 --> 01:42:21,429
For listening to me.

972
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:26,332
Like father, like daughter.

973
01:42:39,052 --> 01:42:43,921
<i>I might have thought</i>
<i>someone could change my life.</i>

974
01:42:44,557 --> 01:42:46,218
<i>No, I did.</i>

975
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:50,628
<i>If one of them had,</i>

976
01:42:51,364 --> 01:42:53,127
<i>would I have been happy?</i>

977
01:42:59,672 --> 01:43:03,904
<i>The plane is going to</i>
<i>departure at 11 am.</i>

978
01:43:11,151 --> 01:43:13,119
Enjoy your trip.

979
01:43:41,447 --> 01:43:42,709
Do you have to go?

980
01:43:45,552 --> 01:43:46,814
Yes.

981
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:51,417
Fine.

982
01:43:51,958 --> 01:43:53,721
I'll be waiting.

983
01:44:24,958 --> 01:44:27,324
<i>The dice has been rolled.</i>

984
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:30,429
<i>I'm still a single woman,</i>
<i>Ms. SHIN.</i>

985
01:45:05,365 --> 01:45:06,832
Bonjour!

986
01:45:49,442 --> 01:45:52,309
