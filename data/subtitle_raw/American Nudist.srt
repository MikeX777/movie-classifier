1
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,299
Call me pessimist, idealist
or dreamer

2
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:24,478
None of these words make me
not enough to tell

3
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:28,749
I am a writer
my photo

4
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:34,276
And I am an artist of sight.
I can completely visualize it in my eyes

5
00:00:34,277 --> 00:00:40,188
And money is everything for me
is not

6
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:47,932
Whatever ... this is the first time
when I'm back ..

7
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,135

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:04,614
I wanted to be a nudist
write a movie about it

9
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:08,630
I was inspired but it's over

10
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:15,452
And then be a director
I wanted to make a movie

11
00:01:50,587 --> 00:01:55,087
This is a typical day of my life
It looks beautiful from the outside

12
00:01:55,088 --> 00:02:00,879
But for an amateurs
here is ordinary

13
00:02:31,502 --> 00:02:33,414

Did you want to be a model?

Is that so?

So people's movements
i like to watch

28
00:05:07,993 --> 00:05:14,400
So actions matter
tells people

29
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:33,792
OK

30
00:05:39,992 --> 00:05:42,160
It was beautiful

31
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,040
I do this for the last time

32
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:39,082
And it feels like having fun right?
to you ? Should we swim?

33
00:10:19,806 --> 00:10:22,718
When I made my first documentary

34
00:10:22,719 --> 00:10:27,853
Research and resources
directed to mannequins

35
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:40,869
Right yes that way

36
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:48,287
As a natural dealing process
they saw it

37
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:52,224
A german in 1929

38
00:10:52,786 --> 00:10:57,368
..amerians also do this
He said he should

39
00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:01,977
He died in 1931
then priest Donnie

40
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:09,084
.. did a physical research
and it was all good for itself

41
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:14,739
This act benefited the country

42
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,706
Many people keep it
had

43
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:24,590
Nude is true

44
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:31,359
And it's a very easy way

45
00:11:33,097 --> 00:11:39,961
The numbers increase and then
spreads

46
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,118
Like this for 15 and 16
continued

47
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:50,222
Many people made movies

48
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:53,613
Press it as America
showed interest

49
00:11:53,614 --> 00:12:00,260
Nude ads around
has been published

50
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:08,072
Naked during the 1960s
spread further

51
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:12,345
Demonstrated as boldness

52
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:33,374
How are you?
-Very good you?

53
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:39,430
I was not expecting to see you
-I'm doing good

54
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:44,395
Have you recorded a nub before?
No, this is the first

55
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:47,818
Very beautiful

56
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:52,267
Hi Aaron Stone I'm
We are in California

57
00:12:52,268 --> 00:13:01,018
Here are Angel Falls
we say and people are here

58
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:05,386
finding peace and now
we are in studio

59
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:07,882
Welcome ..

60
00:13:07,883 --> 00:13:11,459
News internet
on our site

61
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:17,162
With news around the world
we are with you ..

62
00:13:17,736 --> 00:13:21,769
Hi news first
welcome to chapter

63
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:27,532
Ad�m Aaron and this is Red..size
We present nature's features

64
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:33,420
I'm Cristine Wenn ..
We drew naked for TV

65
00:13:34,132 --> 00:13:39,596
California and Hollywood movies
Began to be naked

66
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:44,408
And now everyone is first
can be a little nervous at one time

67
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:51,256
But then everybody
relieves over time

68
00:13:51,257 --> 00:13:57,713
Being this way is international
gives a density and naturalness

69
00:13:57,714 --> 00:14:01,953
Nobody invited me

70
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:09,273
I was very nervous at first ... but
then I did what was required

71
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:15,960
I started walking ... on the pool
It was as if to stand naked ...

72
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:21,016
But it was not bad
as I thought

73
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:24,440
So sitting naked in the pool
the most beautiful

74
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:29,889
Much less stressful
I am feeling

75
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:36,156
I read in the newspaper..and better
A network is acquired

76
00:14:36,157 --> 00:14:43,284
60% of our members are natural
likes not to be

77
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:47,749
What is really so

78
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:06,017
Being naked is a natural thing

79
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:13,256
So naked when I was a little kid
you are walking around

80
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,177
..what's after all?
-Media has a great influence

81
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:28,343
And everybody is very comfortable
he feels

82
00:15:29,265 --> 00:15:33,256
What is the public sometimes ..

83
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,921
He's acting very bossy. Yain
as if there is something wrong

84
00:15:41,489 --> 00:15:44,953
Everyone's worried but I think
nothing wrong

85
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:50,135
Look around ... and
see them as they are

86
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:56,807
As long as it's a family ... I think
This is a safe man

87
00:15:56,808 --> 00:16:01,901
Even children ... should be able to ..
body beautiful individual

88
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,631
It's a way to trust yourself
I had nothing to write

89
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:14,097
My models were always in bikinis
Natural beauty did not appeal to them

90
00:16:14,827 --> 00:16:18,513
Until he entered my life
until

91
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:20,699
Come in love

92
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:34,593
Hi I'm Jennifer

93
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:40,978
Bride

94
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,275
How long have you been doing this job?

95
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:51,970
It has been a few years actually ..
-What about advertising or something?

96
00:16:51,971 --> 00:17:00,965
Yeah ... or something like advertising
- So what else would you do?

97
00:17:02,077 --> 00:17:09,349
I'm ... pretty good basically
I am someone who turned ..

98
00:17:12,813 --> 00:17:17,222
This project is a little clear

99
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:33,039
So you ... maybe ... not
-So ... if it's for f ... if it's a little bit of course

100
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:42,391
Actually I am extraordinary
I'm thinking

101
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:50,285
So ... maybe you like it ..
I'm not sure as a generation too ..

102
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:58,782
Just me
i can answer

103
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:04,834
How your generation reacts
do you think that

104
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:11,458
Actually I don't know

105
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:13,817
.. so the age thing is something else

106
00:18:13,818 --> 00:18:17,745
Something trivial at least

107
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:22,360
As if all your own
in

108
00:18:22,361 --> 00:18:29,849
Maybe it's progress
It's really weird

109
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:34,360
And it's important to care actually

110
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:42,169
It's been about a year
-Yes.

111
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:47,489
When my friend was in high school
he spoke

112
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:53,818
It doesn't matter actually ..
it's important to focus on

113
00:18:54,424 --> 00:19:00,992
It's just that beautiful
I say okay

114
00:19:00,993 --> 00:19:06,618
Party is important ... you are the most
what bothers

115
00:19:09,392 --> 00:19:14,256
I don't know that people ..

116
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:18,881
Men blah and ..

117
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:27,791
Sitting next to me is strange and
old people

118
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:32,857
Of course those on the street or something

119
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:37,993
So I don't want to have problems

120
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:50,008
Where are these movies to be shown?
-In private theaters

121
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:53,593
In small and different places
Before the police arrive.

122
00:19:54,377 --> 00:20:00,154
Like a very different style
-It's necessary to make educational films

123
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:06,599
Also, empathy
time is important

124
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:16,944
So you tell me that
Just come as a colony

125
00:20:17,597 --> 00:20:19,302
Sorry

126
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,438
But you didn't answer my question

127
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,511
Usually people do this
Doesn't care

128
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:36,269
This would be the last conversation
-I want to know

129
00:20:49,491 --> 00:20:53,480
Different to Los Angeles
I was thinking of people

130
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:57,536
And it was very close actually

131
00:20:57,537 --> 00:21:01,642
Sat in my car
like making news

132
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:05,672
Hello, welcome to news
Ben Aaron and -Naomi

133
00:21:05,673 --> 00:21:07,803
Let's start with the topics
Hi I'm Red

134
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:13,240
.. we are starting the news, in America
people are getting undressed more and more

135
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:17,571
And nobody is anymore
not waiting, not looking at each other

136
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:21,996
Is this a very natural individual
sounds like

137
00:21:21,997 --> 00:21:27,824
Stress has begun to decrease
See with ANR before you undress

138
00:21:27,825 --> 00:21:31,945
Do not forget sun cream
it is very important that you drive

139
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:38,030
Because towel is also important ..
Also, do not make direct contact with everyone.

140
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:47,838
And in the public. To touch too
forbidden ... on the beach ... do not throw sand at people

141
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,526
People always ask

142
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:58,078
What will singles do?
That's the weird question

143
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:04,183
It has nothing to do with marriage
so what

144
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:11,070
Probably 10 single men
I know ..

145
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:20,663
And they are sure as well ..
I say it can harm

146
00:22:20,664 --> 00:22:28,263
So to be natural .. to them ..
It may sound different ..

147
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,393
But still nature fields
may always be unresponsive.

148
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:36,640
We will examine the new Nile hotel
today

149
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:41,324
There are 1533 guests in the hotel.

150
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:44,786
As a very beautiful provincial resort
takes place

151
00:22:44,787 --> 00:22:48,330
If they are naked,
very pleased

152
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,565
The oldest naked hotel in the 1940s
was made

153
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:56,617
And in 1960 -90 and 2000
new vacant hotels opened

154
00:22:57,336 --> 00:23:02,363
38 hotels and many rooms
These hotels are ..

155
00:23:02,364 --> 00:23:08,060
a lot of guests

156
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:15,435
There are many celebrations
Britney Spears

157
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:20,514
.. has reached this size and is naked
posed

158
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:25,002
Many famous on this
supports

159
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:30,714
In 1953 Marilyn Monroe's
with the pose he gave to the magazine ..

160
00:23:31,297 --> 00:23:32,849
There was a cover

161
00:23:33,427 --> 00:23:38,252
Marilyn is a beautiful actress
This is how he explained that he was

162
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:42,707
And then a different dimension
won

163
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:49,988
Many people in the cave
She knows she's naked too

164
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:58,415
And then they find a job
and they write these in CVs ..

165
00:23:58,918 --> 00:24:04,478
.. for example, we work like this
we buy

166
00:24:04,479 --> 00:24:11,401
Hello I'm with Mark and Shannon
i am together

167
00:24:11,402 --> 00:24:16,586
How are you?
Good

168
00:24:16,587 --> 00:24:25,993
You have been doing this for a long time
How long has it been

169
00:24:27,346 --> 00:24:33,779
Specially ... our whole life
throughout

170
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:41,882
Actually we took pictures or something
-We are from New York

171
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:46,874
What exactly is this movie for
related?

172
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:52,506
I guess it's about tearing up

173
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:58,106
With american bare
related

174
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:03,723
That you are not a bad person
Many people must know that

175
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:08,691
I have been doing it for a few years
i do this

176
00:25:08,692 --> 00:25:12,841
And these are really different things

177
00:25:12,842 --> 00:25:16,872
It must be very beautiful
-Yes millions of people ..

178
00:25:17,656 --> 00:25:21,496
And people in the streets ..

179
00:25:21,497 --> 00:25:27,000
What are you doing in the movie?
We behave naturally

180
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:35,249
They just said be yourself
We came for the first time

181
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:40,797
Is this really the first time?
I will give my virginity

182
00:25:42,005 --> 00:25:46,308
I think a very different thing is beautiful

183
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:51,308
How is it different to be naked?
-Yes

184
00:25:52,845 --> 00:26:01,036
More different than people
-I am not experienced

185
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:04,469
But I really like it

186
00:26:05,892 --> 00:26:09,763
Very nice to meet you

187
00:26:09,764 --> 00:26:17,668
This does not happen ... what is happening
I don't understand..what will it be?

188
00:26:18,525 --> 00:26:23,852
Somehow ... there must be things
I do not know

189
00:26:25,604 --> 00:26:30,180
What is this guy doing here?

190
00:26:31,643 --> 00:26:35,604
No, no, it doesn't.

191
00:26:35,605 --> 00:26:37,644
Damn it

192
00:26:41,444 --> 00:26:44,236
Nobody understands this philosophy

193
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:12,486
Different when I'm angry
My spin was coming out

194
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:27,406
I don't like it

195
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:33,350
And sometimes I felt like someone different

196
00:28:18,013 --> 00:28:20,798
This is a very nice place
-Say my dear

197
00:28:21,406 --> 00:28:25,454
Glad you have fun

198
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:29,206
Very beautiful so i like it
gone

199
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,886
Yes I know actually

200
00:28:32,887 --> 00:28:40,896
Over time you also take
So I didn't get it right of course

201
00:28:41,424 --> 00:28:50,863
Could be ... my cousin or something.
it was hard but it all passed

202
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:57,447
I heard the hippies started

203
00:28:57,448 --> 00:29:08,048
No, they're just
it was a thing ... a personal one

204
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:19,903
Everything is possible here ... but a lot
people don't know anything about it

205
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:30,304
I mean, it's an art actually ... that's why
not everyone can understand ..

206
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:39,495
At least multiple sex or
Don't be together ..

207
00:29:39,496 --> 00:29:49,629
Urban people ... could not experience this
Should the hippies go somewhere too?

208
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,839
Somewhere with a flowing pattern, i?

209
00:32:50,926 --> 00:32:53,301
You're on your clothesless channel

210
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:57,793
It's a very nice day and we are in Arizona

211
00:32:58,322 --> 00:33:02,541
Today is a great
the day begins

212
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:13,533
Male psychologist for a long time
will explain his research

213
00:33:14,078 --> 00:33:17,627
..and itself a natural object
put forward as

214
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:21,940
Rather than keep it warm just
it is important to let yourself go

215
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:28,387
Environmental stubs spread to 66 states.

216
00:33:28,388 --> 00:33:31,603
Protests in many states
continues

217
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:38,622
But not yet a natural writer too
it continues

218
00:33:38,623 --> 00:33:44,038
The police do not explain about it.
waiting

219
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:50,064
Unrestrained Women
It's okay but men have to wear something

220
00:33:51,441 --> 00:33:57,255
I went to camp when I was in college

221
00:33:57,256 --> 00:34:03,120
There was one black girl ... one black
he was

222
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:08,423
And we became very good friends

223
00:34:09,775 --> 00:34:15,919
Then she's a black girl baby
it was like

224
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:23,960
They were playing together ... very
they were precious and innocent

225
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:28,271
I wish I could protect them

226
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:30,645
You are a cat, you don't understand

227
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,837
And is that a good thing?

228
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,764
When was the last time you did it?

229
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:44,244
When i was 18

230
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:46,444
When the channels are legal

231
00:34:46,445 --> 00:34:52,684
I'm glad that ...
were you waiting

232
00:34:52,685 --> 00:34:56,908
Yeah actually it could be said

233
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,436
Are you back now?

234
00:35:00,437 --> 00:35:04,157
I attended many parties

235
00:35:06,285 --> 00:35:12,049
So which one do you like g, pushed
- I attended a party in Arizona

236
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:17,161
.. it was very nice I liked it

237
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:28,513
I need some watching you

238
00:35:28,514 --> 00:35:36,199
At least in front of the camera
how are you

239
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:44,159
It doesn't matter to me
-Are the parties really boring

240
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,648
Actually not like this ..

241
00:35:47,649 --> 00:35:51,263
Just like letting myself go

242
00:35:51,264 --> 00:36:02,695
What exactly is there in your nature?
Return like a secret

243
00:36:02,696 --> 00:36:06,695
I think it's ironic

244
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:09,862
You are not happy that

245
00:36:11,248 --> 00:36:15,464
And I'm from that
i am glad

246
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:18,222
This is the thing

247
00:36:18,223 --> 00:36:26,920
I'm just men and
I'm around my content

248
00:36:26,921 --> 00:36:33,295
Have an empathy
Stop ... I want a candidate

249
00:36:33,296 --> 00:36:39,111
Take a look around ...
are you doing this?

250
00:36:39,112 --> 00:36:42,096
Why are you scared?

251
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:47,047
I've been doing this for a long time

252
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:52,023
And not too many people around

253
00:37:01,536 --> 00:37:10,672
My name is Josie Golberg..Playboyda
I worked in 2008. My model for 2 years.

254
00:37:10,673 --> 00:37:13,112
Very beautiful ..

255
00:37:13,824 --> 00:37:23,671
I stepped into a program and be a model
I always wanted to do

256
00:37:23,672 --> 00:37:27,495
And success spread rapidly ..

257
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:37,014
But every video has something nice
Well, I did research and

258
00:37:37,526 --> 00:37:41,271
.. finally i called the magazine ..

259
00:37:41,272 --> 00:37:49,408
There was a clear elimination every Thursday
I got dressed and prepared

260
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:56,262
Then with a lot of people
I entered photo shoots

261
00:37:56,263 --> 00:38:02,237
They liked me ... and
they called me

262
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:08,822
Then they called me and
I asked the official

263
00:38:08,823 --> 00:38:13,628
I will be a great show and
they invited me

264
00:38:15,113 --> 00:38:23,113
That's when the bad thing happened
I waited 2 weeks ..

265
00:38:23,713 --> 00:38:30,873
They didn't care and of course
I do not give up

266
00:38:30,874 --> 00:38:35,065
I called the playboy studio
I said my name ..

267
00:38:35,585 --> 00:38:39,539
..and I want to do something for the magazine
but I said I was not accepted

268
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,466
They said wait for me too

269
00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:46,594
Someone dropped the phone

270
00:38:46,595 --> 00:38:50,487
Holly Madison's girlfriend
because he doesn't like you ..

271
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:56,184
..edit�r said okay, but accepted
he said you were not

272
00:38:56,185 --> 00:39:05,728
I said no ... I am in the labor market
I said I want to be

273
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:09,080
I said who's next

274
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:14,800
I talked to Haffner and
Then

275
00:39:15,462 --> 00:39:22,125
one of his secretaries
gave me his assistant

276
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:31,125
And I told him my name
I worked and wanted to be there

277
00:39:31,732 --> 00:39:35,654
Help me for something like that
I asked you could not

278
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:42,349
I'm Jewish and the porn
I said I love

279
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:46,080
Mr. Haffner to my pictures
I wanted him to look

280
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:52,865
Then there someone like me
had to go

281
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:57,816
A lot of jewish women money
was winning

282
00:39:57,817 --> 00:40:01,713
Yes there are a lot of people so

283
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:08,448
Then they said look ... to him
I don't say these but ..

284
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:13,098
..playboy history has never happened ..
we will send you pictures

285
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:19,842
But Haffner these people
unprofitable

286
00:40:19,843 --> 00:40:24,753
Then my grandfather came to my dream
He said wake up, I'll tell you something

287
00:40:24,754 --> 00:40:30,616
Then it was Haffner and with me
started talking to russian

288
00:40:30,617 --> 00:40:34,977
You'll be Josie Playboy's family
and the next day

289
00:40:34,978 --> 00:40:38,913
.. i bought a phone .. photo shots
for

290
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:43,207
Playboy studios
so i entered

291
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,808
What happened, why are you sorry?
you look?

292
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,623
That's all

293
00:43:25,624 --> 00:43:28,264
I hope it's okay

294
00:43:30,087 --> 00:43:31,857
I'm tired

295
00:43:33,423 --> 00:43:36,796
I have 14 scenes shooting

296
00:43:38,124 --> 00:43:42,436
14 thousand pictures

297
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,995
And once I wanted it to be good

298
00:43:49,996 --> 00:43:56,228
Don't worry ... when the time comes
everything happens

299
00:43:56,229 --> 00:43:58,306
If a butterfly lands on you
They say let him come back to you

300
00:43:58,976 --> 00:44:07,594
So your career is sometimes like this
ok, what should happen happens

301
00:44:07,595 --> 00:44:10,386
Whatever is in your destiny will live

302
00:44:11,225 --> 00:44:15,817
I guess you should know that

303
00:44:17,817 --> 00:44:22,682
What if there is nothing out for me

304
00:44:23,882 --> 00:44:30,008
I guess that's good for all of us
then that's what

305
00:44:30,656 --> 00:44:35,751
Everyone has patience
everybody wants something

306
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:41,976
And definitely shouldn't
- not like that

307
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:51,879
Yes I sell it rarely
-No you can always be a teacher

308
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,471
You help others

309
00:44:56,472 --> 00:45:00,303
I tried this ... no way

310
00:45:01,935 --> 00:45:07,472
As if I did everything
everything

311
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:13,144
But it's like it's over
Sorry

312
00:47:33,939 --> 00:47:38,916
How long have you been here?
-6 years

313
00:47:39,468 --> 00:47:45,436
Well, do you have experience in this matter?
-I have suffered

314
00:47:45,437 --> 00:47:48,787
But nothing serious

315
00:47:48,788 --> 00:47:52,571
How did you get started?

316
00:47:53,187 --> 00:47:57,955
To have someone beside you so

317
00:47:57,956 --> 00:48:01,612
Nakedness
I had a friend stripper

318
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:05,302
He got me in this job and
I am very relieved too

319
00:48:06,158 --> 00:48:13,782
When did you first get naked?
Actually, I was so nervous in the bay

320
00:48:13,783 --> 00:48:19,101
But then money is everything
fixed

321
00:48:19,102 --> 00:48:22,493
Only that was enough for me

322
00:48:22,494 --> 00:48:27,902
I got it ... so how
to be continued

323
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,806
The little one is actually this

324
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,486
You are no strings in Vegas
Do you have a club?

325
00:48:35,487 --> 00:48:39,330
Nuts club?
-Places that encourage implantation

326
00:48:40,611 --> 00:48:47,807
Actually I haven't heard
My friend said there was a colony

327
00:48:47,808 --> 00:48:51,551
But I don't know too much

328
00:48:53,526 --> 00:48:57,326
From the beginning

329
00:49:03,278 --> 00:49:04,695
Start

330
00:49:06,847 --> 00:49:09,609
This can not be

331
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,435
It shouldn't be this way

332
00:49:15,825 --> 00:49:20,738
I can do better

333
00:49:40,761 --> 00:49:42,962
No no

334
00:49:42,963 --> 00:49:45,834
I do not want to go

335
00:49:47,514 --> 00:49:52,931
No way not this way
understand

336
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:57,002
I can't

337
00:49:57,609 --> 00:50:00,970
I can't do it that way ..

338
00:50:02,185 --> 00:50:06,825
No it won't fix anything

339
00:50:06,826 --> 00:50:08,913
I say no

340
00:50:14,418 --> 00:50:16,058
Have you ever visited here?

341
00:50:16,059 --> 00:50:21,599
I came here 3 times.
I saw some ministers

342
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:29,776
Well when I invite you
-I'm glad

343
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:33,199
So you didn't jump right away, but

344
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,103
so think
It's nice to be naked

345
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:46,416
Are you naked in your house?
Usually yes actually

346
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:52,879
I guess this is something beautiful ..
comfortable and peaceful

347
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,864
You are at my home ..

348
00:51:00,944 --> 00:51:05,184
I really liked this

349
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:40,130
I'm waiting for a script
i want at my table

350
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:46,354
Whatever the shortest
I want at the time

351
00:51:46,355 --> 00:51:50,594
What are you doing 31?
You are drawing

352
00:51:50,595 --> 00:51:53,673
Dress up and do as I say

353
00:51:54,514 --> 00:51:58,530
I'm waiting for a script from you

354
00:51:58,531 --> 00:52:04,266
To me in the shortest time
send a script, you idiot

355
00:52:04,267 --> 00:52:10,314
Open your eyes and something
start typing

356
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:15,217
Or I won't give you anything

357
00:52:15,218 --> 00:52:21,354
You stupid ... of poverty
your breath smells

358
00:52:21,355 --> 00:52:30,282
Tell me something
Bring the damn script

359
00:52:30,283 --> 00:52:33,570
Ok? Your future belongs to it

360
00:52:34,697 --> 00:52:38,898
Come on, what are you coming to?

361
00:52:40,673 --> 00:52:44,857
I wrote Dalwine

362
00:52:45,906 --> 00:52:52,418
You were Dalwin
Yeah what a small island

363
00:52:53,618 --> 00:52:57,906
I talked to him when you left

364
00:52:59,297 --> 00:53:03,529
What in the same place?

365
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:07,658
That was it then or something

366
00:53:08,145 --> 00:53:15,138
So it comes from human beings
or what should I know?

367
00:53:15,139 --> 00:53:19,777
I spoke this for 5 seconds too

368
00:53:19,778 --> 00:53:23,714
Idiot

369
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:31,449
The first time I heard about it ..
it's a documentary or something

370
00:53:31,857 --> 00:53:36,547
So talk and then continue
to make..

371
00:53:37,953 --> 00:53:42,162
I was very impressed for the first time

372
00:53:43,914 --> 00:53:49,082
Then Marissa told me

373
00:53:49,083 --> 00:53:53,242
We talked about what happened or something

374
00:53:53,826 --> 00:53:59,250
Then of course we waited and
american people

375
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:05,514
..sponsored or something ..
ability and

376
00:54:06,089 --> 00:54:14,218
.. a stupor has come.
Actually there was a story

377
00:54:15,811 --> 00:54:22,603
But these somehow
it didn't feel right

378
00:54:22,604 --> 00:54:26,306
It was just like letting go

379
00:54:26,307 --> 00:54:31,529
And it was very different.
I did not accept

380
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:34,930
He was a public person

381
00:54:34,931 --> 00:54:39,378
And he knew that too

382
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:43,906
Yes ... I know very well
actually

383
00:54:43,907 --> 00:54:46,318
Then of course after high school

384
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:49,966
No not

385
00:55:00,526 --> 00:55:05,546
Will he tell the oil?
-Do it take as long as you can wait?

386
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:09,138
There is this in nature

387
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:13,963
As an ordinary
you started and continued

388
00:55:14,873 --> 00:55:18,953
The people need it

389
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:24,410
And the effect is always
continues

390
00:55:24,411 --> 00:55:33,841
Be patient and carry on
Nazis don't look at it this way

391
00:55:33,842 --> 00:55:38,273
Nazis love adventure

392
00:55:38,274 --> 00:55:46,370
And everybody's own desire
could be

393
00:55:46,371 --> 00:55:50,481
This is also very normal

394
00:55:50,482 --> 00:55:52,751
I do this long and
I do not find it continuous

395
00:55:53,745 --> 00:55:58,730
And it will make a lot of difference

396
00:55:58,731 --> 00:56:03,802
What will be darker than this?

397
00:56:17,185 --> 00:56:21,097
To New Jersey

398
00:56:23,658 --> 00:56:26,962
And don't test it

399
00:56:28,906 --> 00:56:32,322
You owe me money

400
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:35,314
Whatever happens..

401
00:56:35,315 --> 00:56:41,010
You have to do this ..
you owe me

402
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:29,929
I love this picture

403
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:32,979
Very special picture

404
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,483
I know

405
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,987
15 years ago

406
00:57:37,458 --> 00:57:43,377
I think it's pretty good
I was helping those times

407
00:57:43,378 --> 00:57:46,273
It was like letting go of things

408
00:57:48,425 --> 00:57:55,617
Of course there was only a pool ...
I remember him

409
00:57:58,265 --> 00:58:04,481
So how do you feel?
-What do you think ?

410
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:07,313
I do not know that..

411
00:58:07,834 --> 00:58:11,778
So nobody wants to hear anything

412
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:15,845
And I want something to be okay

413
00:58:15,846 --> 00:58:22,182
Look, this is you ... from the heart
if you want- -No

414
00:58:22,758 --> 00:58:26,238
I say it doesn't happen this way

415
01:00:06,658 --> 01:00:08,384
When I was out of school, no

416
01:00:08,385 --> 01:00:16,127
.. I did not see more cats.
There was a black girl

417
01:00:18,423 --> 01:00:23,984
That girl is yellow
he had a friend

418
01:00:24,656 --> 01:00:30,712
And that girl had a dog
a huge dog

419
01:00:30,713 --> 01:00:32,751
Think

420
01:00:32,752 --> 01:00:37,582
And it was so precious ... it was innocent

421
01:00:37,583 --> 01:00:42,255
So ... just don't film it
if i could get

422
01:00:43,449 --> 01:00:46,176
You understand, right?

423
01:00:46,177 --> 01:00:50,191
So this is something innocent

424
01:01:05,016 --> 01:01:10,976
Techno boys and the self-releasing
extraordinary minds

425
01:01:11,872 --> 01:01:17,392
Profit and a lot of doors
close

426
01:01:17,393 --> 01:01:22,392
When love is completely out
to live

427
01:01:22,393 --> 01:01:24,128
With tattoos and piersings
to live

428
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,400
Seeing the hardest and the best

429
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:31,932
Only in the health clinic
stumble

430
01:01:31,933 --> 01:01:37,740
To give up health and to
let go

431
01:01:37,741 --> 01:01:42,396
Snagging and
to live

432
01:01:42,397 --> 01:01:46,436
Neither luck nor another
to live something

433
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:49,044
Living for free sex

434
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:54,620
I only have hope for a screen day

435
01:01:55,964 --> 01:01:57,828
Hello

436
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:02,164
It's great that you are here

437
01:02:02,165 --> 01:02:04,260
Hello Hello

438
01:02:04,891 --> 01:02:13,348

-Yes, very nice actually

439
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:16,378
I hope everyone is fine

440
01:02:21,786 --> 01:02:24,673
Let's see everyone
in fine fettle

441
01:02:31,027 --> 01:02:33,574
Where do you belong?
To the valley road

442
01:02:38,758 --> 01:02:42,613
Do you want to come ?
-Definitely yes

443
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:46,582
But it doesn't matter, we are family

444
01:02:47,302 --> 01:02:51,934
Let's see
it will be great

445
01:02:53,493 --> 01:02:56,348
Karen for me in Hollywood
he said he was alive

446
01:02:56,349 --> 01:02:58,075
Yes

447
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:02,935
What can I tell

448
01:03:03,817 --> 01:03:12,520
You should see him ... my father
took us to the first nude party

449
01:03:13,528 --> 01:03:16,503
It was this way ..

450
01:03:29,398 --> 01:03:33,774
But everything was so fine

451
01:03:33,775 --> 01:03:38,134
Not true actually nothing to do

452
01:03:38,135 --> 01:03:42,534
Come on Jimmy you see
you too

453
01:03:42,535 --> 01:03:45,871
And all in their own right

454
01:03:46,446 --> 01:03:49,678
I want to continue

455
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,470
Without fear, without committing crime

456
01:03:54,054 --> 01:03:58,642
And grow
- I'm Kelly and I'm 18

457
01:03:58,643 --> 01:04:01,159
I'm 18 years old
You are

458
01:04:04,198 --> 01:04:08,814
And I love to take pictures

459
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:12,278
And swimming and ..

460
01:04:22,023 --> 01:04:24,334
Like a dolphin

461
01:04:59,482 --> 01:05:03,009
Come on, smile

462
01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:06,137
Kelly slow down

463
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:10,907
Are you ready?
1 2 3 

464
01:05:10,908 --> 01:05:13,619
Thanks were great

465
01:05:19,145 --> 01:05:22,769
The only purpose of being naked
rise to the sun

466
01:05:25,002 --> 01:05:29,611
So your family can take you

467
01:05:29,612 --> 01:05:32,466
And everything is fine

468
01:05:32,467 --> 01:05:35,722
Play something

469
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:39,530
Baby Twister or something �?
What?

470
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:44,546
My clothes are with me

471
01:05:54,959 --> 01:05:58,191
What is this ?
-My outfit

472
01:05:59,992 --> 01:06:03,071
I did not bring a bore

473
01:06:05,464 --> 01:06:10,576
Have you worked for them?
-No

474
01:06:11,727 --> 01:06:13,120
Oh really

475
01:06:13,121 --> 01:06:18,312
You and you right into the pool

476
01:06:18,313 --> 01:06:25,055
If you're going to swim with me, my towel
My wife

477
01:06:25,056 --> 01:06:28,563
What did you say ? Your body these guys
you use it to play with you

478
01:06:28,564 --> 01:06:32,843
This is very nice nothing

479
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:37,539
Jimmyy.

480
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:43,739
My brother in 2nd grade in high school
what has he done to me

481
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:48,266
And accept it all
It was very hard

482
01:06:49,218 --> 01:06:56,266
By myself for 1 year
I hate it

483
01:06:56,267 --> 01:07:00,675
And bigger than that
I lived things

484
01:07:01,395 --> 01:07:04,930
So letting go of the individuals

485
01:07:04,931 --> 01:07:07,467
And then out of high school

486
01:07:07,468 --> 01:07:11,139
Once with Amy like the old days
to love ... and to love always

487
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:01,131
I want this

488
01:08:01,981 --> 01:08:06,675
Do you want something?
-No

489
01:08:06,676 --> 01:08:09,644
Like taking risks

490
01:08:09,645 --> 01:08:14,964
Is it promoted or individual?
-No -Yes

491
01:08:18,684 --> 01:08:22,076
Yes you are afraid

492
01:09:02,703 --> 01:09:05,941
Self-confident

493
01:09:09,454 --> 01:09:12,717
I can't do that

494
01:09:12,718 --> 01:09:15,478
No, i can't

495
01:09:37,536 --> 01:09:39,977
It will be beautiful

496
01:09:50,918 --> 01:09:54,486
Your virginity ..

497
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:04,734
I will ... i can

498
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:10,703
That is all

499
01:10:10,704 --> 01:10:12,590
So much..

500
01:10:12,591 --> 01:10:16,934
Damn life

501
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:30,070
Why me why

502
01:10:31,645 --> 01:10:34,950
It's like I'm lost

503
01:10:37,941 --> 01:10:40,671
I don't know what to do

504
01:10:40,672 --> 01:10:43,750
I'm so confused

505
01:11:43,562 --> 01:11:49,458
I guess it's a lot of time together
we are passing

506
01:11:49,459 --> 01:11:53,408
I'm not afraid at all

507
01:11:56,073 --> 01:11:59,562
I just don't feel comfortable

508
01:12:03,449 --> 01:12:07,186
Just ... everyone is so big

509
01:12:07,187 --> 01:12:10,377
I've heard this before

510
01:12:10,378 --> 01:12:14,793
What changes?

511
01:12:16,985 --> 01:12:19,146
I can not do this

512
01:12:31,434 --> 01:12:34,826
How does it feel

513
01:12:34,827 --> 01:12:36,218
What happened ?

514
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:39,002
Something ..

515
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:53,434
You are very angry
-Depter

516
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:55,691
What are you shouting

517
01:12:57,785 --> 01:12:59,865
What do you want

518
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:02,690
What does that mean?

519
01:13:03,153 --> 01:13:06,723
What do you want ?
-What are you saying ?

520
01:13:06,724 --> 01:13:10,049
Why are you coming every day?

521
01:13:11,537 --> 01:13:19,505
I said or I'm interested ..
I want to know, naked

522
01:13:19,506 --> 01:13:24,074
I do not eat this.
do you want

523
01:13:25,738 --> 01:13:28,578
What do you want ?

524
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:33,506
What do you want ?

525
01:13:34,834 --> 01:13:38,090
What do you want ?

526
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:41,881
What do you want ?

527
01:13:43,922 --> 01:13:46,057
What are you doing?

528
01:13:47,002 --> 01:13:49,138
What do you want ?

529
01:13:53,338 --> 01:13:56,003
I think you should go

530
01:13:56,004 --> 01:13:58,810
Making
-Go

531
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:10,737
I learned a lot for a few weeks

532
01:14:12,944 --> 01:14:21,057
But ... somehow still a secret
I think something is happening

533
01:14:34,657 --> 01:14:37,274
What's your purpose?

534
01:14:56,073 --> 01:14:59,626
I want you to stay
-No

535
01:14:59,627 --> 01:15:03,044
I can't anymore
I can't finish without you

536
01:15:03,787 --> 01:15:09,195
I can not do
-I give a lot

537
01:15:09,196 --> 01:15:14,651
But I can't take your wife
I'm going crazy

538
01:15:14,652 --> 01:15:18,212
Something you have to sacrifice

539
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:23,036
Even though I give a lot
there is nothing to repurchase

540
01:15:24,163 --> 01:15:26,860
It's destroying me

541
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:33,195
I do not understand.
not without you

542
01:15:33,196 --> 01:15:37,740
I'm not inspired or anything

543
01:15:40,308 --> 01:15:43,187
Ho��akal

544
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:50,276
Give me some detail

545
01:15:57,706 --> 01:16:05,352
Stop dealing with these
I will hang out irrelevant to them all

546
01:16:05,353 --> 01:16:08,519
I can't, I can't work with you

547
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:12,360
I will do this

548
01:16:12,361 --> 01:16:16,032
Taylor is always the same thing

549
01:16:16,033 --> 01:16:19,408
You will do that too

550
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:25,960
For the studio and for all

551
01:16:27,631 --> 01:16:31,248
Look I did everything

552
01:16:31,656 --> 01:16:34,599
What's going on there?

553
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:40,656
You were very good but ..

554
01:16:40,657 --> 01:16:43,136
Look what's happening now

555
01:16:43,137 --> 01:16:45,191
I know but..

556
01:16:45,192 --> 01:16:48,928
This is something that should be ready

557
01:16:48,929 --> 01:16:51,943
And you know it too

558
01:16:51,944 --> 01:16:54,655
I don't want to see

559
01:16:54,656 --> 01:16:58,519
No no no

560
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,543
Keep quiet

561
01:17:02,128 --> 01:17:07,687
Do you understand me?
-It doesn't happen this way

562
01:17:07,688 --> 01:17:15,992
This is too much ... everyone
waiting for presentation

563
01:17:15,993 --> 01:17:20,455
I can't work with you like that

564
01:17:20,456 --> 01:17:26,623
I don't like it
I say

565
01:17:26,624 --> 01:17:29,440
No look ... look ..

566
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:34,342
Only one can replace
Listen

567
01:17:34,901 --> 01:17:40,309
I want a movie in my office

568
01:17:40,925 --> 01:17:47,838
Put a stop to this and
do something now

569
01:17:47,839 --> 01:17:52,014
Because I don't like this

570
01:17:52,015 --> 01:17:56,014
No you can't no

571
01:17:56,015 --> 01:17:59,262
I say you can't

572
01:17:59,997 --> 01:18:04,110
Don't tire me

573
01:18:04,686 --> 01:18:07,597
I say no to you no

574
01:18:08,366 --> 01:18:13,181
Do you understand me?
Behave yourself

575
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:25,477
You can't do that
Fuck you

576
01:18:25,478 --> 01:18:27,758
Yes i am telling you

577
01:18:27,759 --> 01:18:33,726
The studio is already ready and
finds someone

578
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:39,285
I have those movies on my desk
I want

579
01:18:39,286 --> 01:18:42,198
This is nonsense

580
01:18:44,141 --> 01:18:49,117
I say you can't
I say not to you

581
01:18:49,598 --> 01:18:50,974
No way

582
01:18:52,662 --> 01:18:58,645
And Teressa came to me.
asked about my inspiration

583
01:18:59,910 --> 01:19:03,981
I was afraid to tell you

584
01:19:03,982 --> 01:19:08,462
Truly my inspiration is not

585
01:19:08,463 --> 01:19:16,077
You did a lot of stuff ..
there are always individuals

586
01:19:16,078 --> 01:19:19,253
And things affect you

587
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:23,798
You are actually

588
01:19:25,877 --> 01:19:31,022
There was a girl
Name� Amy

589
01:19:31,582 --> 01:19:33,502
I know

590
01:19:34,262 --> 01:19:39,878
I know her
Look, it's no different

591
01:19:40,487 --> 01:19:44,806
You're torturing yourself or something

592
01:19:46,517 --> 01:19:51,741
Let me guess it was high school open

593
01:19:52,837 --> 01:19:55,621
How did you know?

594
01:19:56,293 --> 01:19:58,310
And still..

595
01:19:59,222 --> 01:20:05,756
.. is it making you think?
-Yes I guess

596
01:20:10,188 --> 01:20:15,604
Then you keep on this
will it be necessary?

597
01:20:18,764 --> 01:20:20,972
You need to understand

598
01:20:20,973 --> 01:20:25,339
Nobody go on this way
won't

599
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:29,555
It's important to just be convinced

600
01:20:36,387 --> 01:20:38,573
Thanks

601
01:20:43,044 --> 01:20:46,019
Come on be real

602
01:20:46,692 --> 01:20:51,667
Come on, don't regret living alive

603
01:20:51,668 --> 01:20:55,140
Come on I'm telling you

604
01:24:32,298 --> 01:24:35,881
Everybody talks

605
01:24:36,706 --> 01:24:40,962
What can I say?

606
01:24:40,963 --> 01:24:46,754
No, I didn't say otherwise
All these people

607
01:24:46,755 --> 01:24:51,153
Not good

608
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:57,793
This will happen in the end

609
01:25:01,537 --> 01:25:04,457
Wait then what is it

610
01:25:07,074 --> 01:25:12,801
You just get the price

611
01:25:12,802 --> 01:25:14,210
OK

612
01:25:14,898 --> 01:25:17,577
See

613
01:25:18,226 --> 01:25:22,721
Breakfast was very good

614
01:25:22,722 --> 01:25:27,634
And I don't know what to do
so i love it

615
01:25:28,281 --> 01:25:32,010
What are you saying ?

616
01:25:34,178 --> 01:25:39,306
I ended the film

617
01:25:39,307 --> 01:25:44,201
I think it's ... very bad so

618
01:25:44,202 --> 01:25:48,266
You could do very nice things

619
01:25:48,267 --> 01:25:54,602
Something exciting
could be good for you

620
01:25:55,177 --> 01:25:58,705
And then it's important to continue

621
01:25:58,706 --> 01:26:02,850
Finally showing the individuals

622
01:26:02,851 --> 01:26:07,898
To the young ... and time
need

623
01:26:07,899 --> 01:26:12,161
Must search around

624
01:26:13,019 --> 01:26:17,187
And you know that too

625
01:26:18,297 --> 01:26:24,490
Return like success ..
don't spend something wasted

626
01:26:24,491 --> 01:26:30,154
This is the right thing.
come to me if you want

627
01:26:30,722 --> 01:26:33,762
I will do my best

628
01:26:33,763 --> 01:26:38,257
My customer told me

629
01:26:38,258 --> 01:26:41,506
And you know it too

630
01:26:42,522 --> 01:26:44,905
This is something like a secret

631
01:26:44,906 --> 01:26:50,346
Come on, we'll have a secret
I want to know someone

632
01:26:52,114 --> 01:26:57,162
All in its own right
You know too but

633
01:26:58,499 --> 01:27:04,857
And the book was published
Nobody can accept this

634
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:07,898
It has nothing to do with me

635
01:27:07,899 --> 01:27:12,441
Most of them will be in my own business too

636
01:27:12,442 --> 01:27:15,889
What do you want to write

637
01:27:16,401 --> 01:27:21,169
The truth
-What is this really like me

638
01:27:21,170 --> 01:27:28,665
So if you're going to give yourself to somebody
it is important that you do this

639
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:35,584
You are addicted to it
-Depter

640
01:27:35,585 --> 01:27:38,735
Look why I don't understand

641
01:27:38,736 --> 01:27:42,671
Look I don't want to be a ghost

642
01:27:42,672 --> 01:27:47,391
But why not that
why is that ?

643
01:27:47,807 --> 01:27:52,207
I tell you why
just wake up

644
01:27:52,208 --> 01:27:57,152
Say you can
let's just say

645
01:27:57,153 --> 01:28:00,007
Speak to the subject

646
01:28:00,631 --> 01:28:03,912
Come on one thing or another

647
01:28:05,607 --> 01:28:07,807
Say something

648
01:29:32,941 --> 01:29:38,870
And finally your new year
premiere

649
01:29:38,871 --> 01:29:47,189
.. on the way to the naked
Many politicians told this

650
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:51,150
And what happened after
you know

651
01:29:51,151 --> 01:29:56,743
Pretty thing in New York
had changed

652
01:29:56,744 --> 01:30:05,189
In 1941, anti-Lacks appeared
Output and

653
01:30:05,190 --> 01:30:10,167
they are also some materials
Kard� 

654
01:30:10,168 --> 01:30:14,357
Invisible materials

655
01:30:15,661 --> 01:30:23,326
Yeah I remember them too
It continued for 20 years

656
01:30:23,327 --> 01:30:26,021
Write it down come on

657
01:30:26,022 --> 01:30:30,725
Nakedness
Good morning

658
01:30:33,725 --> 01:30:36,790
God ... this is great

659
01:30:36,791 --> 01:30:41,662
Shall we have fun?
Welcome

660
01:30:41,663 --> 01:30:48,110
The first nude tourist
to the center

661
01:30:48,111 --> 01:30:55,470
Know before the girls
There will be 20 competitors here

662
01:30:55,471 --> 01:31:00,526
And all will present
itself

663
01:31:01,381 --> 01:31:09,415
Come on let's not love
I can get so excited for everyone

664
01:31:09,416 --> 01:31:17,533
And this traditional genre
1st place

665
01:31:20,454 --> 01:31:23,637
It's great to be here

666
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:29,821
What are you doing else?

667
01:31:51,606 --> 01:31:54,229
All in itself

668
01:31:54,230 --> 01:31:56,938
And they all set out

669
01:32:02,234 --> 01:32:04,082
And here we are

670
01:32:04,714 --> 01:32:09,449
And now the audience
we are waiting

671
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:13,532
Girls to be here
will faint

672
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:17,932
It won't end this way

673
01:32:20,189 --> 01:32:25,235
Sometimes girls are so nervous
can be

674
01:32:25,236 --> 01:32:29,396
And that's actually pretty normal

675
01:32:48,378 --> 01:32:51,440
Doing it alone

676
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:54,649
Points are awarded for this

677
01:33:29,349 --> 01:33:31,470
I can not do

678
01:34:39,101 --> 01:34:42,000
Hi Taylor!
