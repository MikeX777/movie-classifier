1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,200
How's the sea?
- This is great.

2
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:15,801
It's really pretty.

3
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:20,602
Impressive. Those cliffs...
- Look down there! It's scary!

4
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:25,203
If you fall down
the current will drag you.

5
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:28,904
Are you recording, Haruko?
Give it to me for a second.

6
00:00:29,105 --> 00:00:32,105
- No, don't.
- I'll film you. I'll film you.

7
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:37,406
Stand here by me. Our company's
very own diva, Haruko-san!

8
00:00:37,707 --> 00:00:40,207
And Yotchan! Yay!

9
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:44,808
What a waste being behind
the camera! - It is, isn't it?

10
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:48,809
Being so pretty!

11
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,210
Wow, it's amazing.
How high!

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,400
It's really high!

13
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:01,201
Yes, but it's beautiful.
It's sparkling!

14
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,201
Wow!

15
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:12,002
Come and look!
Super scary.

16
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:15,603
It's scary looking down.

17
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:18,804
It's beautiful. So blue.

18
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:25,605
What? What?

19
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:35,206
<i>August 12, 2005</i>

20
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:39,407
<i>A random attack incident
occurs in Myogasaki.</i>

21
00:01:39,608 --> 00:01:43,408
<i>Two people die, one person
is seriously injured.</i>

22
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,609

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
<i>3 years later.</i>

24
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:13,001
<i>Koji Shiraishi - Director</i>

25
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:18,602
<i>I began gathering info on the incident
so that it would be remembered.</i>

26
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:23,203
Stand here by me. Our company's
very own diva, Haruko-san!

27
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:27,204
What about the people
who were stabed?

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,800
I don't know the exact location
where they were but...

29
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:35,401
HARUKO TOYODA
FILMED THE INCIDENT

30
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:40,102
When I looked back from there,
in this area, there was a woman...

31
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:45,103
SHINOBU KURIMURA,
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
This is the spot where she was stabbed.

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
Satomi had a dream.

33
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:55,801
In the dream she was in Myogasaki.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,400
17 YEARS OLD SATOMI YONEHARA
DIED IN THE INCIDENT

35
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:03,401
In her dream Myogasaki was so
beautiful. She said that was a sign...

36
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:07,602
SATOMI'S MOTHER
...that something good would
happen if she went to Myogasaki.

37
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:10,403
Something marvelous.

38
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,604
That's what she said.

39
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:17,605
I really had the intention of going
there with her but...

40
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:20,206
...the timing was bad...

41
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:23,607
...and she seemed to be
in a hurry to do so...

42
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:26,808
...so she ended up going alone.

43
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
I was intending to marry her...

44
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:33,601
...so I was buying
this apartment for us.

45
00:03:33,902 --> 00:03:37,702
NORIKO MIGITA, 25 YEARS OLD
- DIED IN THE INCIDENT

46
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:41,803
One night three years ago,
I was with Migi in her apartment.

47
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:45,004
HIDEKI TANIGUCHI -
WAS ENGAGED TO NORIKO

48
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:49,105
By Migi, I mean my girlfriend.
That is what I used to call her.

49
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:53,706
Migi was looking at a magazine
that had a picture of Myogasaki in it.

50
00:03:53,907 --> 00:03:57,507
She was saying,
"Oh, I'd like to go there."

51
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:01,508
So we talked about it and got
so excited with the idea,

52
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,709
that we went to a rent-a-car
in the middle of the night,

53
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,110
rented one and took off right away.

54
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,900
Before that I was living
with my parents in Osaka.

55
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:15,801
I was a temporary worker.

56
00:04:16,002 --> 00:04:18,802
Back then,
I thought they might think

57
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:22,503
I was f***ng nuts,
so I didn't dare say anything.

58
00:04:22,704 --> 00:04:26,304
About a week before the incident
I was laying down at home.

59
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:29,905
SHOHEI ENO, 30 YEARS OLD -
INJURED IN THE INCIDENT

60
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:33,005
When I turned on the TV,
a voice spoke to me.

61
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:36,906
It sounded like ****'s voice,
and told me to go to Myogasaki.

62
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:41,007
I heard the voice say that.
- What do you mean?

63
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
"Go"

64
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:46,801
"To"

65
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:49,602
"Myogasaki"

66
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:54,203
"Go to Myogasaki"

67
00:04:56,004 --> 00:05:00,404
When you say you heard a voice,
couldn't it have been a hallucination?

68
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:03,405
That's what I thought at first.

69
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:06,406
But then there was a family
travel show on the TV.

70
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:10,607
The show was about Myogasaki.
I was surprised when I saw that.

71
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:15,008
I thought, "There is such a place!
Such a place does exist!"

72
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:18,609
So I thought something miraculous
would happen if I went.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,600
So you went to Myogasaki
expecting to see that miracle.

74
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,601
Yes.

75
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:29,202
Were there many
people here that day?

76
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:32,403
There weren't that many.

77
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:36,804
We were walking around,
looking at the ocean...

78
00:05:37,305 --> 00:05:40,905
...and then I had to
go to the restroom.

79
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:45,606
I told her to wait a minute for me
and went to the restroom.

80
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,807
It took me a little while.

81
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:53,408
I was walking around for a while,
waiting for something to happen.

82
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:57,609
As I did, I started
to cross the bridge...

83
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,410
and stopped to look at the ocean.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,200
Then I heard a voice behind us.
When I turned around...

85
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:10,201
I could hear people screaming.

86
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:14,902
When I looked behind me,
he was stabbing people.

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,600
I was scared, terrified.
So I tried to run away.

88
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:36,701
But my legs would not respond.
I couldn't move my legs.

89
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:39,502
So I fell forward.

90
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:44,503
The man tried to run away,
fell and bumped against me.

91
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:49,104
When I pointed the camera at him
he screamed at me for help.

92
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,800
Help! Help me!

93
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:02,001
When I didn't see Migi,
I panicked and started running.

94
00:07:02,202 --> 00:07:05,802
I saw her lying down
near the middle of the bridge.

95
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:09,003
So I ran up to her and...

96
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:12,604
...I saw that she was bleeding.

97
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:16,505
I looked backwards and saw that
the man was coming my way.

98
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:20,506
He came and stabbed and slashed
me in the back, around this area.

99
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,707
Are you alright?

100
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:26,808
Haruko-san!

101
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:34,009
Help me!
Somebody, please!

102
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,810
Somebody!

103
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000
Isn't that the guy?
That's him, isn't it?

104
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:57,401
Oh, no!

105
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:08,002
<i>The criminal jumped into the ocean.
His body was never found.</i>

106
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:18,603
The criminal came all the way up
to this area, right? - Right.

107
00:08:19,204 --> 00:08:23,204
Why didn't you try to run away
having seen what happened?

108
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:27,405
Well, I guess...

109
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:31,806
I thought there was something
important that I...

110
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:40,007
What did you think was
so important at the moment?

111
00:08:40,608 --> 00:08:43,008
What did I...?

112
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:45,909
What did I...?

113
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,610
I don't know.

114
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,300
If you think about it now,
you don't know.

115
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:59,001
You see, when we first started
to make this documentary,

116
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:04,602
I was thinking that there was an
impending importance to doing it...

117
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:09,403
...but just like you, Toyoda-san,

118
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:13,204
I don't seem to know
exactly what it is.

119
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:19,005
Lately, Satomi...

120
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:23,706
...has been appearing
in my dreams.

121
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:28,507
In the dreams she is
ringing the doorbell.

122
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:33,808
I go to open the door for her
and she is standing there.

123
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,009
Then she speaks to me slowly.

124
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,410
What does she say to you?

125
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,300
"A"

126
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:52,001
"Hi"

127
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:53,702
"Ra"

128
00:09:53,903 --> 00:09:55,403
"Wa"

129
00:09:55,604 --> 00:09:57,104
"Ma"

130
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,305
It probably means "I'm home".

131
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,300
At least I thought that is
what she was trying to tell me.

132
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:07,901
I say "welcome back",
and when I do...

133
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,800
Her... her mouth
opens up this big.

134
00:10:13,401 --> 00:10:17,601
Her mouth? - Yes, her
mouth opens up real big.

135
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:21,602
And she laughs real hard.

136
00:10:21,803 --> 00:10:24,603
Then I laugh along with her.

137
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:29,604
You see, at that time I really...

138
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:33,105
I really suffered.

139
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:38,306
But ever since I've become
able to see her,

140
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:42,507
I certainly feel at ease.

141
00:10:44,408 --> 00:10:46,408
Wait...

142
00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:51,509
You mean you're able to see
Migita-san as a ghost, right?

143
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,010
No, not as a ghost.
I can actually see her in reality.

144
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,000
Of course, she is dead,
but I have a picture.

145
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:04,001
A pic...?

146
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:09,002
Is that like spirit photography
or something?

147
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,303
No.

148
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:16,804
This picture is from time
when Migi was still alive.

149
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:20,805
Oh, the young woman
next to you is Migita-san.

150
00:11:22,006 --> 00:11:25,806
This was taken with friends
I went out to drink with.

151
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:29,407
PICTURE TAKEN ONE MONTH AGO

152
00:11:29,808 --> 00:11:33,008
You mean, that girl over there?
- Yes.

153
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,209
You mean this is Migita-san?

154
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,400
That's right.

155
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:47,801
There is no doubt, this is Migi.

156
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:52,402
When he was stabbing me...

157
00:11:52,803 --> 00:11:57,303
...he looked at me and said:
"It's your turn now, okay?"

158
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:02,404
<i>"It's your turn now, okay?"</i>

159
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:07,405
You clearly heard him say that
while he was attacking you?

160
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:11,406
Yes. Would you like to see
the scar? - Yes, please.

161
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,200
I was the only one slashed like this.

162
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:23,601
The rest of the people
were stabbed in the neck.

163
00:12:24,002 --> 00:12:28,402
That is so weird.
Why didn't he kill me?

164
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:33,303
Why didn't that man kill me?

165
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,204
What a waste being
behind the camera!

166
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,600
<i>The criminal Ken Matsuki -
31 years old at the time of incident</i>

167
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:50,001
When you think about the time
before the incident,

168
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:54,202
do you see anything that would
suggest it would turn out like this?

169
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:58,503
<i>Tatsukichi Matsuki -
Father of Ken Matsuki</i>

170
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:02,804
You...

171
00:13:04,205 --> 00:13:07,005
...have no idea, then.

172
00:13:11,906 --> 00:13:15,306
What kind of person
was Matsuki at that time?

173
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:19,207
<i>Futoshi Kondo - high school
classmate of Matsuki</i>

174
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:23,108
He was a really...

175
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:27,609
...normal and kind person.

176
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:32,510
KEN MATSUKI IN HIGH SCHOOL
- He was into supernatural topics.

177
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,800
You know, things like ghosts.

178
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:39,801
Supernatural abilities, UFO's.

179
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:43,402
He used to talk a lot
about those kinds of things.

180
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:46,603
Did you hear him say
he saw a UFO?

181
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:50,404
Yes, he was pretty forward
about having seen a UFO.

182
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:53,205
Oh, and how was that?

183
00:13:53,406 --> 00:13:57,406
He said that at night
there was an object shining

184
00:13:57,607 --> 00:14:00,807
outside his room window.

185
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,408
He said it was flying
in a strange angular motion.

186
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:10,609
At first he seemed to be
seeing this continually.

187
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,600
<i>Right after the incident
Shohei Eno witnessed a UFO, too.</i>

188
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:22,001
After the attack, I woke up at night
in a room in a hospital.

189
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:25,602
There was a window and
there were trees outside.

190
00:14:25,803 --> 00:14:29,203
On top of those trees
there was a huge UFO.

191
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:33,604
You are saying that you saw
an unidentified flying object? -Yes.

192
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:37,405
I think it was about
30 or 40 meters long.

193
00:14:37,606 --> 00:14:41,306
It was shedding a pale
orange light on me.

194
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:46,407
It stayed there for a few seconds,
and then disappeared into the sky.

195
00:14:46,808 --> 00:14:49,808
My mother saw it too.

196
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,800
FUMIE ENO - SHOHEI ENO'S MOTHER
- You mean the UFO we saw?

197
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:57,801
Yes, that's right. The UFO.

198
00:14:58,002 --> 00:15:01,002
I was watching it above me.

199
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:04,803
As I watched it,
suddenly it disappeared.

200
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,204
<i>We asked if he had any knowledge
about the Eno-san's wound.</i>

201
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:13,505
Look at this picture. Sorry for
showing you this all of the sudden.

202
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,506
This was on his back.

203
00:15:18,807 --> 00:15:22,207
There is something
that looks a lot like it.

204
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:25,208
What looks like this?

205
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:30,809
There was something on Mitsuki's
body that looked exactly like this.

206
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, wait a second!
Your nose is bleeding!

207
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:40,401
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:45,602
Oh, it's okay.

209
00:15:48,803 --> 00:15:52,403
<i>We couldn't question him
any more after this.</i>

210
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:59,904
I will show you this. Let me know
if it reminds you of anything.

211
00:16:01,005 --> 00:16:03,505
This here...

212
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:07,906
...is a drawing of a wound
that was inflicted by your son

213
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:12,807
on the back of Eno-san
with the knife.

214
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:16,808
It was a large wound.

215
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:22,609
Well, in his skin,
this part up here...

216
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,810
Ken had a mark
that looked like this.

217
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:30,911
He had it since he was born.
- Since he was born?

218
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:35,112
Since he was a child
he used to say:

219
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,100
"God has put his signature...

220
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,501
...on me."

221
00:16:46,602 --> 00:16:50,002
How did your son react to having it?

222
00:16:52,203 --> 00:16:55,003
He was happy about it.

223
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:08,204
How many of them are spending
the night at manga coffee shops now?

224
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:11,005
<i>Akira Wakatsuki - Producer</i>

225
00:17:11,206 --> 00:17:14,806
Hmm, I wonder. I didn't check
the number at the time.

226
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,107
But I think they are
roughly about 20.

227
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:22,008
Excuse me. I'm here with Eno-san.
- Oh, thanks for coming.

228
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:25,009
<i>We wanted to show him something.</i>

229
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:29,010
Nice to meet you. I'm Wakatsuki.
- I'm Eno. - It's a bit crowded.

230
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,800
- Oh, hello there.
- Hello. Thanks for being here.

231
00:17:33,001 --> 00:17:36,201
Are you living here?
- No, this is my office.

232
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:40,002
This is spacious.
There's another room here.

233
00:17:40,203 --> 00:17:42,703
Please sit over here.

234
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:46,604
This wasn't very far from Shinjuku.
- That's right.

235
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:51,705
So you live someplace else?
- Yes. Nobody lives in here.

236
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,600
This was taken by a person who
was filming during the incident.

237
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:02,801
<i>First we showed him
the footage from Myogasaki.</i>

238
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:09,702
Oh, I remember
hearing that conversation.

239
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:16,003
What was happening with you there?

240
00:18:16,404 --> 00:18:19,204
There... I was...

241
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:23,605
I think I had fallen down already.

242
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:26,806
<i>Help! Help me!</i>

243
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:31,407
Now you can see the part
where you are being attacked.

244
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:36,008
In this area in the sky there is
something dark that flies over.

245
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:40,809
There!
- Oh, my God!

246
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,900
<i>Help! Somebody, please!</i>

247
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:53,301
Could you please replay it?

248
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:02,302
<i>Help! Somebody, please!</i>

249
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:22,203
This is incredible.
I hadn't seen that thing flying.

250
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:26,004
This is a picture of Ken Matsuki.

251
00:19:26,404 --> 00:19:30,404
<i>Then we showed him the picture
we got from Ken Matsuki's father.</i>

252
00:19:30,705 --> 00:19:33,905
His father gave us the picture.

253
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:38,806
Taken when Ken was a child. If you
look here he has a birthmark...

254
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:42,407
Wait a second!

255
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,400
This looks just like...
- Your scar, yes.

256
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:50,201
Is this natural?

257
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:59,004
<i>Ken Matsuki - 8 months</i>

258
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:07,405
<i>Ken Matsuki - 5 years old</i>

259
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:16,506
<i>Ken Matsuki - 8 years old</i>

260
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,200
To be honest, in the moment
when he stabbed me,

261
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:39,001
I thought it was done with God's
guidance, so it didn't matter if I died.

262
00:20:39,202 --> 00:20:42,802
Up until then I was leading
a crappy life anyway.

263
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:48,003
I don't hate or resent
Matsuki-san. None of that.

264
00:20:48,604 --> 00:20:52,804
Maybe I should be thankful;
maybe he prepared something for me.

265
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:56,605
From leading a crappy life
to being here.

266
00:20:56,806 --> 00:21:00,406
It's all because of a series
of miracles ever since.

267
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:05,507
Could you be more specific
about the "series of miracles"?

268
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:10,508
I'm afraid I cannot talk about that.
- You don't want to talk about it?

269
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:15,009
But they're a series of good things
and what you would call miracles.

270
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,400
Do you mean phenomena that
are out of the ordinary? -Yes.

271
00:21:19,701 --> 00:21:23,501
<i>It seems that by miracles
he means paranormal phenomena.</i>

272
00:21:23,802 --> 00:21:27,802
- Can you actually see them?
- Yes, they are visible. And beautiful.

273
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:32,103
<i>However, he never gives details
as to what these "miracles" are.</i>

274
00:21:32,404 --> 00:21:36,804
So, strange things are happening.
What makes you call them "miracles"?

275
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:40,005
I have a feeling they are.

276
00:21:40,806 --> 00:21:45,406
Anyone would feel that way. And
you can actually see them? - Yes.

277
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,800
And you believe that
they are miracles?

278
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:52,601
Can those things be filmed?
Captured on camera?

279
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:56,902
I'm not sure because they tend
to occur in the blink of an eye,

280
00:21:57,103 --> 00:22:00,903
so I don't know if time allows it.
But they happen every day.

281
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:05,104
You mean that on average
these miraculous things

282
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:08,905
are happening at least
once every day?

283
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:11,806
That's right.

284
00:22:12,007 --> 00:22:14,807
Every day they happen once?

285
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:18,608
Well, lately yes,
it has been like that.

286
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,900
Then if I were to spend
the day filming you,

287
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:26,201
and something does happen,

288
00:22:26,402 --> 00:22:30,402
the probability of capturing it
on tape should be high.

289
00:22:31,203 --> 00:22:34,603
Yes, I guess it could
be caught on camera.

290
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:40,004
<i>I began filming Eno-san around the
clock to get the miracle on camera.</i>

291
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:45,805
Hello. This is Eno, #5418299.

292
00:22:46,206 --> 00:22:50,406
<i>Every evening, he calls to confirm
appointments for temporary jobs.</i>

293
00:22:51,007 --> 00:22:54,407
About the appointment
tomorrow... Oh, I see...

294
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:59,008
<i>When you reach 30, temporary
jobs become scarce rapidly.</i>

295
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:04,509
Do you have anything else available
even if it is for a short time?

296
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:09,109
<i>This is also influenced by downsizing
tendencies of corporations.</i>

297
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,810
I understand.
I will be standing by, then.

298
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:16,011
Thank you. Goodbye.

299
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm on stand by now.
- What is that?

300
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:24,401
From tomorrow until another term.

301
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:29,202
<i>Standing by means waiting
for a call to substitute someone.</i>

302
00:23:29,603 --> 00:23:33,803
In case someone doesn't come to
work, I come in as a substitute.

303
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:37,904
- Oh, you replace that person.
- Yes, a replacement.

304
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:43,305
<i>Replacement hours are 6 to 9 am.
If no call comes in, there's no work.</i>

305
00:23:45,606 --> 00:23:48,206
Between 6 and 9?
- Yes.

306
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:51,207
And vacant positions
don't come often, do they?

307
00:23:51,408 --> 00:23:54,408
That's right, most of
the time they don't.

308
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:59,409
<i>If there's no work, he doesn't get
paid for his part as a replacement.</i>

309
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,000
They don't pay me.
- They don't?! - No.

310
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:16,401
<i>He gets most of his groceries
from 100 yen shops.</i>

311
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:20,702
- 100 yen shops are the best.
- Yes, they are cheap.

312
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:26,203
Would you care to explain
what you're doing?

313
00:24:26,404 --> 00:24:29,204
I look at the grams of weight.

314
00:24:29,705 --> 00:24:33,705
<i>He buys groceries based on whether
they will fill his stomach or not.</i>

315
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:37,606
<i>He verifies that by
weighing them in his hand.</i>

316
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:05,607
<i>He doesnt have his own apartment.</i>

317
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,000
<i>He spends nights at a manga cafe.</i>

318
00:25:18,301 --> 00:25:21,801
<i>He is a so called
"internet cafe refugee".</i>

319
00:25:32,802 --> 00:25:35,602
You eat that often, huh?

320
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:40,403
Yes, this one has
vegetables in it. See?

321
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:45,004
It has cabbage.
- Is that all it has?

322
00:25:49,405 --> 00:25:52,605
<i>The miracle still doesn't happen.</i>

323
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:10,406
<i>To get ready for temporary jobs,
he goes to a fast food restaurant.</i>

324
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:23,807
Excuse me, do you have 100 yen?
- Ah, sure.

325
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,200
I appologize.

326
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:40,201
It's 6:04.

327
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:47,002
<i>3 hours later.</i>

328
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:54,403
<i>In the end, no calls came.</i>

329
00:26:54,704 --> 00:26:58,704
Could they call few minutes after?
- No, they're not calling today.

330
00:26:58,905 --> 00:27:02,905
- What will you do about money?
- It's gonna be a problem.

331
00:27:04,406 --> 00:27:07,606
<i>I bought him some breakfast
to cheer him up.</i>

332
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:11,607
Mega Muffin combo set, please.
- What will you drink?

333
00:27:12,608 --> 00:27:15,608
- This is good.
- Is it?

334
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:23,500
Do you at least have the money to
stay at the internet cafe tonight?

335
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:27,001
No, I don't have it.

336
00:27:27,302 --> 00:27:30,702
<i>Eno-san has completely
ran out of money.</i>

337
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:34,203
So, what will you do today?
Not much choice.

338
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,004
I still have a little money left.

339
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:42,805
But I can't go to the
internet cafe all the time.

340
00:27:50,406 --> 00:27:53,006
That was it, right?

341
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:01,807
<i>Was this the "miracle"?</i>

342
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,200
Did you make this wrapping move
with your mind?

343
00:28:06,401 --> 00:28:09,201
No, I don't have that ability.

344
00:28:19,002 --> 00:28:22,002
You see? I didn't even touch it.

345
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:25,603
Amazing.

346
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:29,704
This has been happening to me
all the time. - What do you mean?

347
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:33,505
It happens to me everyday.
I've been seeing things like UFOs.

348
00:28:33,706 --> 00:28:37,306
After the incident I've seen them
often, but much more lately.

349
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,107
But not only that,
I've seen ghosts too.

350
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,900
I've seen UFOs and ghosts
at the same time.

351
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:45,701
And I've been hearing
that voice a lot, too.

352
00:28:45,902 --> 00:28:48,502
A voice spoke to me.
I heard the voice say that.

353
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:51,203
<i>A voice.</i>

354
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:55,004
Since when have you been
hearing this voice?

355
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:58,205
Since I left the hospital.

356
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:01,906
Would you say it's the same voice...

357
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:06,007
...that you heard before
the incident happened?

358
00:29:06,408 --> 00:29:10,408
Well, I don't understand it now.
- Is it a voice that sounds like ****?

359
00:29:10,809 --> 00:29:13,809
Yes, you could say
it sounds like ****.

360
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,200
<i>He can't understand the voice
he's been hearing since the hospital.</i>

361
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:25,601
Can I have a cigarette, please?

362
00:29:25,802 --> 00:29:28,402
- Oh, sure.
- Thank you.

363
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:32,203
This is the camera
we would like you to use.

364
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:36,104
<i>We asked Eno-san to film
the miracles by himself.</i>

365
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:39,805
In case you manage to
get something on film,

366
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:42,806
we will pay you a fee.

367
00:29:43,007 --> 00:29:46,207
Huh? You will pay me?
- We will pay you a fee.

368
00:29:46,408 --> 00:29:50,008
- You mean I can get money?
- Yes. We will pay you.

369
00:29:50,209 --> 00:29:53,409
- Really? Glad to hear that.
- Do your best.

370
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,400
Wow, this sounds like a job.

371
00:29:56,601 --> 00:30:00,599
Is fee in proportion to the times
I catch something on film?

372
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
That seems fair, doesn't it?

373
00:30:04,401 --> 00:30:09,001
Well, if director agrees with it,
then I trust his decision.

374
00:30:09,802 --> 00:30:13,402
So, if I record something 3 times,
I can assume it will be divided by 3.

375
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,803
That's right. We will pay you
if you record something.

376
00:30:17,004 --> 00:30:21,004
Should I point it forward mostly?
- Yes, please. - Got it.

377
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:24,805
Oh, yes, I wanted to ask...

378
00:30:25,006 --> 00:30:28,806
...if you could have me
for a couple of days? - Huh?

379
00:30:29,407 --> 00:30:32,607
- Just for a couple of days.
- For a couple of days?

380
00:30:32,808 --> 00:30:36,208
- I mean letting me stay here.
- Oh, you mean staying here.

381
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:38,909
Yes, if you could.

382
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,900
That's going to be
a little difficult. - Oh, I see.

383
00:30:43,201 --> 00:30:46,201
We've just met you, so...

384
00:30:47,602 --> 00:30:51,402
The way I see it,
I think he could get a lot...

385
00:30:52,403 --> 00:30:56,203
...and I mean a lot of things
on camera. - Yeah, I know that.

386
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,604
I spent some time with him.

387
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:04,005
It takes a lot of time just cheering
him up, no matter what we get.

388
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:07,006
So if you think about it...

389
00:31:07,207 --> 00:31:10,807
...in total... we could get
lots of direct footage,

390
00:31:11,008 --> 00:31:14,208
and it's quite convenient
for all of us.

391
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,100
If we have you filming
for about a week,

392
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:22,001
do you think that's
enough time to record

393
00:31:22,202 --> 00:31:26,102
a good number of those
miracles you mentioned?

394
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:30,403
Yes, I think I could get plenty.
- Alright then.

395
00:31:30,604 --> 00:31:34,204
You can stay here for a week.
- Thank you.

396
00:31:35,005 --> 00:31:38,805
<i>We decided to let him stay
for a week and see the results.</i>

397
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:42,406
You will stay in this room.

398
00:31:42,707 --> 00:31:45,507
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

399
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,900
We'll be leaving soon.

400
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:56,201
The cigarettes you had...

401
00:31:56,402 --> 00:31:59,002
- You can keep them.
- Thanks.

402
00:31:59,603 --> 00:32:02,403
Thank you very much.

403
00:32:15,004 --> 00:32:19,404
They decided to let me stay in the
office for a week, starting today.

404
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:23,105
I think soon I can film
some impressive stuff

405
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:26,906
that ends up being
used in their film.

406
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,800
Of course, this won't last long.

407
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:36,201
But while it lasts, I'll do my best.
I'm going to sleep now.

408
00:32:59,202 --> 00:33:02,802
I'm calling to confirm
tomorrow's appointment.

409
00:33:03,103 --> 00:33:04,703
Yes.

410
00:33:05,604 --> 00:33:07,204
Yes.

411
00:33:07,605 --> 00:33:11,205
Oh, thank you very much!
Five times a week.

412
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,406
Oh, for a month? Thank you.

413
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:18,307
Okay. Goodbye.

414
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:25,808
They have a job for me.

415
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:32,009
A temporary job. I'll work
5 times a week for a month.

416
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,900
Yes. Uh...

417
00:33:36,401 --> 00:33:40,401
Anyway, this is good.
I'll give it my best.

418
00:33:41,702 --> 00:33:46,102
<i>Eno-san made a modest party
to celebrate getting a job.</i>

419
00:33:47,403 --> 00:33:51,203
Cheers! - Cheers!
- We're counting on you!

420
00:33:56,604 --> 00:33:59,804
You're quite a drinker.
- Man, really...

421
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:04,205
It's been a long time
since I had draft beer.

422
00:34:04,406 --> 00:34:07,806
Let's have premium kalbi,
steak, premium beef tripe,

423
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:11,207
pork gibblets, pork cheek...
- Look at him go!

424
00:34:11,408 --> 00:34:14,808
...yukhoe, and then some
chicken ginseng soup!

425
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,500
If you drink like that
on empty stomach...

426
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:23,701
Well, we'll eat a lot today, so...

427
00:34:39,802 --> 00:34:42,602
It's really good.

428
00:34:42,803 --> 00:34:47,003
The good thing about manga cafes
is that you can take a shower,

429
00:34:47,204 --> 00:34:50,204
you can use the air conditioner,

430
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:54,405
and you don't have to spend money
on things like fuel and electricity.

431
00:34:54,606 --> 00:34:57,606
That's good.
- It sounds good.

432
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,400
They also have beverages that you
can drink as much as you like.

433
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,401
What are you doing over there?

434
00:35:05,602 --> 00:35:09,102
You put your fingers together and
circle them around each other.

435
00:35:09,303 --> 00:35:12,103
It supposedly helps brain power.

436
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:15,504
That's not what I meant.
We are all talking together,

437
00:35:15,705 --> 00:35:18,705
and drinking and you're
keeping to yourself.

438
00:35:18,906 --> 00:35:21,306
I was listening.

439
00:35:21,507 --> 00:35:25,107
So you say, but you're doing something
else on your own. It's weird.

440
00:35:25,308 --> 00:35:29,908
- Sometimes she goes blank.
- It's the same with her interviews.

441
00:35:30,109 --> 00:35:32,909
She doesn't seem to be
doing them wholeheartedly.

442
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,100
Do you think people will
open up to you like that?

443
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:39,801
Do you think one has to get
emotional to perform an interview?

444
00:35:40,002 --> 00:35:43,002
I don't mean getting emotional.

445
00:35:43,203 --> 00:35:47,203
But it's important to show
you are trying to get close.

446
00:35:47,505 --> 00:35:51,105
So not getting close to someone
is bad? -Damn right, it is.

447
00:35:51,406 --> 00:35:55,006
If I'm doing an interview
and get emotional about it,

448
00:35:55,207 --> 00:35:59,007
the person being interviewed
will not understand why I...

449
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:02,408
No, no. I'm not talking
just about interviews.

450
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:05,409
In general you prefer
not to get close to others.

451
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,210
No wonder you can't
get a boyfriend.

452
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,200
You don't have the right
to talk to me like this.

453
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:14,201
You don't like to hear it,
but that's the way it is.

454
00:36:14,402 --> 00:36:17,402
Come on, let's forget
the whole thing, okay?

455
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:20,203
But it's wrong.

456
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:22,904
Forget about it.

457
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:27,105
I think it's time for me to leave.
I have to get up early.

458
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,000
That's what I dont get about you.
We're here, your bosses are here...

459
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:34,001
I think you will enjoy your food
more if I'm not here.

460
00:36:34,202 --> 00:36:38,202
No, no, that's not it.
You see, she's running away.

461
00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:42,103
I'm not running away from anything.
I'll see you tomorrow.

462
00:36:42,304 --> 00:36:44,404
What? What is that?

463
00:36:44,605 --> 00:36:48,605
- Here's the skirt steak.
- Thanks. Do you want some?

464
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,806
- Good night.
- What's with her?

465
00:36:52,107 --> 00:36:54,507
Let's just eat.

466
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:57,208
What a bitch!

467
00:36:57,409 --> 00:37:01,209
Well, when there is no courtesy...
- Courtesy or not, she's a bitch.

468
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,710
Let's eat.

469
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,100
I'm sorry, could I have
a cigarette? - Sure.

470
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:12,201
Let's forget about all this.
Could we drop the formal speech?

471
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:16,602
This is an informal situation.
Let's just enjoy ourselves.

472
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:21,103
What do you say? Drop the san
and call me kun instead.

473
00:37:21,704 --> 00:37:25,704
<i>"Kun" is a more informal version
of the "san" put after names.</i>

474
00:37:26,205 --> 00:37:28,705
Well, I don't know...

475
00:37:29,006 --> 00:37:32,006
Okay, lets do it!
- That's better.

476
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:35,907
From now on I'll call you Eno-kun.
- Yes, call me Eno-kun.

477
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:39,808
When things get informal
people start using dialect,

478
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:44,009
and there are times when I don't
understand what they're saying.

479
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,600
- Are you from the east side?
- No, I'm from Fukuoka.

480
00:37:47,801 --> 00:37:50,801
From Fukuoka? From the west!
That's great!

481
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,802
How about you, chief?
- I'm from Tokyo.

482
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:57,403
Nah, he's no good.
We're west guys here.

483
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:04,004
Shiraishi-kun, how about
you drink it all up?

484
00:38:05,405 --> 00:38:08,205
One more draft beer.

485
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:11,206
Thank you.

486
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,300
"You should carry on a mission."

487
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:21,401
I've been hearing something
like that from the voice.

488
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:25,302
What did it say?

489
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,903
A voice spoke to me.
I've heard a voice.

490
00:38:29,704 --> 00:38:33,904
<i>What is the voice that Eno-kun
hears saying to him now?</i>

491
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:38,305
What did you say
the voice said to you?

492
00:38:38,606 --> 00:38:41,906
You understand it, don't you?
- No, I don't.

493
00:38:42,107 --> 00:38:46,107
You're not a very good liar.
You do understand it.

494
00:38:48,008 --> 00:38:50,808
Well, I'll tell you this.

495
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:54,009
When Matsuki-san
was stabbing me,

496
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,800
he said something like
"it's your turn now, okay"?

497
00:38:58,601 --> 00:39:01,601
<i>"It's your turn now, okay"?</i>

498
00:39:04,202 --> 00:39:08,402
By that he didn't mean that
he was going to stab me next.

499
00:39:08,803 --> 00:39:12,403
He meant "I am passing
the baton over to you now."

500
00:39:13,004 --> 00:39:16,804
So this wound is the baton
he passed on to me.

501
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:20,605
It's the baton I received
from Matsuki-san.

502
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:25,406
Matsuki-san was
performing God's will.

503
00:39:25,607 --> 00:39:28,807
In a strict sense,
it was a divine ceremony.

504
00:39:29,008 --> 00:39:32,208
They never found his body after
he jumped into the sea, right?

505
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:36,409
That's because he went someplace
else. Into a different dimension.

506
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:40,210
His body moved into another
dimension? - That's right.

507
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,200
In other words, you say that
the incident was a ceremony...

508
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,901
...through which
Matsuki-san was able to...

509
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:54,602
...move into God's realm?
- Yes, yes, yes.

510
00:39:55,703 --> 00:39:59,503
Are you going to do
the same thing Matsuki did?

511
00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:03,904
This doesn't have to be
done by killing people.

512
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:08,005
There are other means.

513
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:11,706
But I am not ready yet,
so I haven't...

514
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,600
I haven't said that I'm going to
do something like that, yet.

515
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:21,301
In case you decide that
as part of that ceremony

516
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,502
you are going to kill people,

517
00:40:24,703 --> 00:40:28,103
then you should know
I will have to stop you.

518
00:40:28,604 --> 00:40:32,204
As a friend it is
something I must do.

519
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:36,505
But it's not coming to
any of that, of course.

520
00:40:36,706 --> 00:40:40,106
You really aren't gonna do that?
- No, I'm not, I'm not.

521
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,000
I was awake.

522
00:41:04,201 --> 00:41:07,201
I was awake at the restaurant, too.

523
00:41:07,402 --> 00:41:10,402
You were pretending to be asleep?

524
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:13,403
Let's go over there.

525
00:41:15,404 --> 00:41:18,004
I heard everything.

526
00:41:18,205 --> 00:41:22,005
What we talked about during
the dinner? - I heard it all.

527
00:41:22,206 --> 00:41:26,406
He's thinking of murder or something
that has to do with killing.

528
00:41:26,607 --> 00:41:29,507
He's thinking that, isn't he?

529
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,500
I can't say for sure.
- But it's quite possible.

530
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:39,401
What he said makes
one think it's possible.

531
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:48,302
<i>The following morning.</i>

532
00:41:48,603 --> 00:41:51,003
I'm leaving.

533
00:41:51,304 --> 00:41:54,704
<i>Eno-kun leaves for work, something
he hasn't done in a long time.</i>

534
00:41:54,905 --> 00:41:57,505
- Take care.
- I will.

535
00:42:11,106 --> 00:42:14,706
Looks cloudy today,
but it might clear up.

536
00:42:15,007 --> 00:42:17,807
I'm going to a place...

537
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,200
...called Kichiouji.
We'll all meet there.

538
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:28,601
From Shinjuku, I could get there
by taking the Chuo line.

539
00:42:29,702 --> 00:42:33,502
It costs 210 yen.
But if I take the Keio line,

540
00:42:33,803 --> 00:42:37,003
and then... wait, how is it?

541
00:42:38,004 --> 00:42:41,204
I get off at Meidaimae,

542
00:42:42,005 --> 00:42:45,605
then transfer to the
Keio Inokashira line,

543
00:42:45,906 --> 00:42:49,506
and from there I get
to Kichiouji. If I do that,

544
00:42:49,807 --> 00:42:53,207
it will cost me 190 yen. So...

545
00:42:54,608 --> 00:42:57,608
It means I save 20 yen.

546
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,400
I heard that today's gig
will be vinyl packaging.

547
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:07,001
I was worried
I might smell of alcohol.

548
00:43:07,202 --> 00:43:10,002
I guess I'm fine now.

549
00:43:10,703 --> 00:43:13,903
I'm going into Shinjuku station.

550
00:43:24,504 --> 00:43:28,604
Oh, a police box. They have
no clue what I'm up to.

551
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:34,805
I have arrived near the meeting
place. This is Kichiouji.

552
00:43:36,206 --> 00:43:39,606
That is where we are meeting.

553
00:43:40,207 --> 00:43:45,207
But these ones have helmets,
they are doing construction work.

554
00:43:46,808 --> 00:43:50,008
They are not from my group.

555
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:54,909
They meet here and then take off.

556
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,800
Right now it's 7:15.

557
00:44:06,601 --> 00:44:11,001
I was so excited that I came
here a little too early.

558
00:44:18,002 --> 00:44:20,602
Oh, there it is!

559
00:44:21,503 --> 00:44:24,503
I think I just saw a UFO, but...

560
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:28,304
<i>It seems he just missed a UFO.</i>

561
00:44:30,305 --> 00:44:32,505
<i>Evening</i>

562
00:44:40,506 --> 00:44:43,206
Today's work is over.

563
00:44:43,607 --> 00:44:48,007
When we finished work
we all came back here.

564
00:44:48,408 --> 00:44:51,808
It was such a liberating feeling.

565
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:56,609
And somehow,
how shall I put it...

566
00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,010
It's like the world has
never looked so beautiful.

567
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,800
Even the cloudy weather
today is pretty.

568
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:12,001
It's like I could
accomplish anything.

569
00:45:12,302 --> 00:45:15,902
I feel that I have
been blessed so much.

570
00:45:17,603 --> 00:45:21,003
<i>It's like I could
accomplish anything...</i>

571
00:45:26,604 --> 00:45:29,604
I arrived at the apartment.

572
00:45:31,205 --> 00:45:34,405
I can't get carried away too much,

573
00:45:34,806 --> 00:45:38,406
so today I chose to eat
this cup ramen here.

574
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:47,200
Well, I'm finally here.
I wonder if it's still open.

575
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:51,201
Yup, it is.

576
00:45:51,702 --> 00:45:55,702
- Welcome back.
- Oh, you're still here?

577
00:45:57,103 --> 00:45:59,703
How was work?

578
00:46:00,404 --> 00:46:03,304
It was over before I knew it.

579
00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:06,905
I didn't get anything
on camera today.

580
00:46:07,106 --> 00:46:09,906
There wasn't anything today.

581
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,900
Wow, look at that.

582
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:21,201
Was that another one
of those miracles?

583
00:46:21,402 --> 00:46:24,802
No doubt it was a miracle.
Nobody touched any of that.

584
00:46:26,403 --> 00:46:29,203
That scared the crap out of me.

585
00:46:32,004 --> 00:46:36,604
<i>Is there a meaning in Matsuki's
birthmark and Eno-kun's scars?</i>

586
00:46:42,005 --> 00:46:44,805
<i>"Ancient Egiptian
Symbol Dictionary"</i>

587
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:48,906
<i>"The Sumerians"
"Ancient Japanese Characters"</i>

588
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,700
I did a search on the internet.

589
00:46:54,001 --> 00:46:56,801
I researched a little bit,

590
00:46:57,202 --> 00:47:01,602
and I found one particular thing
that really caught my attention.

591
00:47:02,803 --> 00:47:06,403
This is from someone
who is called Watanabe Peko.

592
00:47:06,804 --> 00:47:10,404
She is a manga artist.
I found this picture.

593
00:47:11,405 --> 00:47:14,605
There are some
strange patterns there.

594
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:18,606
She says they are from
automatic handwriting.

595
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:23,107
I was surprised by this.

596
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:26,508
The left side has
Matsuki's birthmark.

597
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:29,809
It has a very similar shape.

598
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,300
Now, the right side has a pattern
similar to Eno-kun's scars.

599
00:47:45,201 --> 00:47:48,201
I draw a lot of storyboards...

600
00:47:48,602 --> 00:47:51,602
<i>Manga Artist Watanabe Peko</i>

601
00:47:51,903 --> 00:47:55,703
...and preliminary sketches
for the comics in this store.

602
00:47:56,204 --> 00:47:59,804
Sometimes, when I'm tired,

603
00:48:00,805 --> 00:48:03,805
I tend to doze off,

604
00:48:04,405 --> 00:48:07,605
or I end up falling asleep.

605
00:48:09,206 --> 00:48:12,606
And then, immediately after I do,

606
00:48:13,007 --> 00:48:15,507
it's like...

607
00:48:16,208 --> 00:48:21,208
when I'm in that state between
waking up and dozing off,

608
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:27,609
my hand starts moving.
It's like it's moving on its own,

609
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,400
and it starts
drawing things by itself.

610
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:40,801
I have them here.

611
00:48:42,202 --> 00:48:45,402
They're in this area.
- These ones here?

612
00:48:46,203 --> 00:48:49,203
So this is what they look like.

613
00:48:50,004 --> 00:48:52,604
When it moves...

614
00:48:55,005 --> 00:48:57,805
...it feels as if it's numb.

615
00:48:58,106 --> 00:49:01,506
So I'm wondering if
it really is moving.

616
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:05,107
But it keeps on moving...

617
00:49:07,108 --> 00:49:10,708
...and scribbling things on its own.

618
00:49:11,609 --> 00:49:14,609
It's a strange feeling.

619
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:19,710
- You're not doing it consciously.
- It's called automatic writing.

620
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Have you written this specific
pattern here before?

621
00:49:25,201 --> 00:49:28,201
No, it's the first time.

622
00:49:28,802 --> 00:49:31,602
Does it make you feel something,

623
00:49:31,803 --> 00:49:35,603
or remind you of something
particular when you look at it?

624
00:49:37,004 --> 00:49:39,804
No, not really.

625
00:49:42,005 --> 00:49:46,805
I'm sorry to bring this up but
three years ago in Myogasaki...

626
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,400
Watanabe-san?

627
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:54,501
Are you alright?

628
00:50:00,502 --> 00:50:03,102
Watanabe-san?

629
00:50:32,103 --> 00:50:35,303
Watanabe-san, are you alright?

630
00:50:44,004 --> 00:50:46,604
What is this?

631
00:50:47,205 --> 00:50:49,505
This is...

632
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:53,606
<i>There was something
I recognized in that drawing.</i>

633
00:50:54,407 --> 00:50:57,207
<i>Shiraishi's memo from 2005</i>

634
00:50:57,808 --> 00:51:01,008
<i>"Kutoro Rock at Mt. Ohiruyama"</i>

635
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:05,009
<i>There was something on
the top of the mountain</i>

636
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,700
<i>I climbed on the day
of the incident 3 years ago.</i>

637
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:19,401
<i>"Mt. Ohiruyama"</i>

638
00:51:19,802 --> 00:51:22,602
<i>"Kutoro Rock"</i>

639
00:51:39,203 --> 00:51:43,803
<i>Kutoro Rock at Mt. Ohiruyama.
Something must be there.</i>

640
00:52:50,704 --> 00:52:53,704
<i>"Mt Ohiruyama"</i>

641
00:55:02,805 --> 00:55:04,805
There.

642
00:55:05,106 --> 00:55:08,506
You can see it there, in the fog.

643
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,800
<i>"Kutoro Rock"</i>

644
00:55:16,201 --> 00:55:19,401
We are facing this side.
- Yes.

645
00:55:19,802 --> 00:55:23,302
Picture was taken on
the opposite side of the rock.

646
00:55:23,603 --> 00:55:27,203
- So we have to go around it?
- Yes. To the other side.

647
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:30,304
Let's go take a look.

648
00:56:03,605 --> 00:56:06,205
Oh, that's right.

649
00:56:06,506 --> 00:56:09,906
If you look at it from there...
it's the same.

650
00:56:31,107 --> 00:56:34,707
Three years ago
I went climbing by myself,

651
00:56:35,008 --> 00:56:38,408
and came all the way up here.

652
00:56:38,909 --> 00:56:42,909
I visited places like this during
my mountain climbing trips.

653
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,500
I knew about reports of a, uh...

654
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,000
a rock with a fascinating shape,

655
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:55,601
so I thought I should climb and see.

656
00:56:57,202 --> 00:57:01,802
<i>When I reached the top at that time,
I noticed something bizarre.</i>

657
00:57:03,303 --> 00:57:07,903
When I reached the top, I felt
something strange on my left leg.

658
00:57:08,104 --> 00:57:11,704
On this leg
there were 9 leeches,

659
00:57:12,005 --> 00:57:15,605
attached to my leg,
all side by side.

660
00:57:15,906 --> 00:57:19,506
It was scary.
I pulled them all off.

661
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:25,100
<i>"9 leeches"</i>

662
00:57:27,201 --> 00:57:29,801
<i>"9"</i>

663
00:57:31,002 --> 00:57:36,402
<i>"Kutoro" loosely translated means
The Rock of the 9 Headed Spine.</i>

664
00:57:50,403 --> 00:57:53,003
Careful there.

665
00:58:05,604 --> 00:58:08,804
There are some things
like white spots.

666
00:58:12,005 --> 00:58:14,805
There's a hole in here!

667
00:58:20,006 --> 00:58:22,606
Look at that!

668
00:58:25,607 --> 00:58:28,007
Look!

669
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,200
My leg hurts.
- Your leg?

670
00:59:02,201 --> 00:59:06,601
<i>Blood was flowing from the spot
where leeches were once attached.</i>

671
00:59:11,002 --> 00:59:15,202
I am part of a production staff
making a documentary.

672
00:59:15,403 --> 00:59:19,203
Do you have anyone
who has been investigating

673
00:59:19,404 --> 00:59:23,304
writings on a petrogliph
related to Mt. Ohiruyama?

674
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:27,405
TOURISM DEPARTMENT OF OHIRU
- Yes, we have one person.

675
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:31,406
But I'm afraid this person
is not a scholar or anything.

676
00:59:31,607 --> 00:59:34,707
He is a horror movie director.

677
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:38,008
His name is Kioshi Kurosawa.

678
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:41,700
- I see. Kioshi Kurosawa?
- Yes.

679
00:59:43,201 --> 00:59:47,401
How long have you been
investigating Mt. Ohiruyama?

680
00:59:47,702 --> 00:59:51,402
KIOSHI KUROSAWA
- It's been quite some time.

681
00:59:51,703 --> 00:59:55,703
I suppose I began at the same
time I started making movies.

682
00:59:56,304 --> 01:00:00,304
<i>Kurosawa-san is an autodidact
who investigates historic ruins.</i>

683
01:00:00,605 --> 01:00:04,605
I've learned about Ohiruyama
on my own because I'm fond of it.

684
01:00:04,806 --> 01:00:08,606
<i>Mt. Ohiruyama has been his object
of study for more than 20 years.</i>

685
01:00:08,807 --> 01:00:11,807
<i>He still investigates
there when time allows.</i>

686
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,508
...and sometimes I do
investigations about it alone.

687
01:00:15,809 --> 01:00:20,209
At the top of Mt. Ohiruyama
there is a lot of rocky areas.

688
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Many ancient characters
can be found there.

689
01:00:25,901 --> 01:00:29,901
Characters such as these
are written there.

690
01:00:31,202 --> 01:00:36,202
There are many distinctive
hieroglyphs and ideographs.

691
01:00:37,203 --> 01:00:41,603
Here I have written particular
meanings for each and every one.

692
01:00:43,204 --> 01:00:46,804
I'm still making efforts...

693
01:00:47,505 --> 01:00:51,505
...until I thoroughly
understand all of its contents.

694
01:00:53,605 --> 01:00:58,005
These are all things that you have
come to learn by yourself?

695
01:00:58,806 --> 01:01:03,206
Yes, but they are still in need
of further investigation.

696
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:09,807
I hear that Mt. Ohiruyama is
a sacred ceremonial site. - Yes.

697
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,300
What kind of deity
is worshipped there?

698
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:16,601
In a word: Hiruko.

699
01:01:18,802 --> 01:01:22,402
<i>Hiruko (literally "Leech child")</i>

700
01:01:23,003 --> 01:01:25,803
There are many places

701
01:01:26,004 --> 01:01:29,804
where specific gods have been
worshipped for a long time.

702
01:01:30,005 --> 01:01:34,005
Now, Hiruko is a deity that
appears in Japanese mythology.

703
01:01:34,206 --> 01:01:38,206
I'm sure you've heard of
gods Izanami and Izanagi.

704
01:01:38,407 --> 01:01:42,207
The gods that created
Japanese islands.

705
01:01:45,108 --> 01:01:49,108
The first son that was
born of these two gods...

706
01:01:51,409 --> 01:01:54,209
...was called Hiruko.

707
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,200
The story goes that he was
born without any limbs.

708
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,600
He was a crippled, deformed child.

709
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:05,401
He had no arms or legs,
so he had the form of a leech.

710
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:09,602
Mt. Ohiruyama takes its name
after Hiru, which means leech.

711
01:02:12,903 --> 01:02:15,603
A-hi-ra-wa-ma

712
01:02:17,004 --> 01:02:18,604
O

713
01:02:18,805 --> 01:02:20,405
hi

714
01:02:20,606 --> 01:02:22,206
ru

715
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:24,007
ya

716
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:25,808
ma

717
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:31,009
<i>Ohiruyama
The Mountain of the Leech</i>

718
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,000
When we climbed to the top
of Mt. Ohiruyama the other day,

719
01:02:36,201 --> 01:02:39,801
we discovered something that
really caught our attention.

720
01:02:40,202 --> 01:02:44,802
<i>We asked for his opinion on the
figure carved out of the stone.</i>

721
01:02:45,203 --> 01:02:49,203
We brought a picture of it in case
you knew something about it.

722
01:02:49,404 --> 01:02:52,404
We found a stone like this.

723
01:02:53,605 --> 01:02:56,605
Where was this found?

724
01:02:56,906 --> 01:03:01,206
There is an area on
the far side of Kutoro Rock,

725
01:03:02,007 --> 01:03:05,407
that is hidden and can't be seen.

726
01:03:08,208 --> 01:03:11,008
This is really impressive.

727
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,800
I didn't know about this.

728
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:20,501
Do you have any idea
what could it mean?

729
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:24,502
Let's see. On the left side...

730
01:03:28,203 --> 01:03:32,203
...we have something like this.

731
01:03:32,504 --> 01:03:35,504
This is called an oracle.

732
01:03:35,805 --> 01:03:40,205
It means divine affairs,
or when a god gives his orders.

733
01:03:40,606 --> 01:03:45,206
This thing here is "sessho"
concept of Buddhism.

734
01:03:45,507 --> 01:03:49,507
It has the meaning
of killing living things.

735
01:03:49,808 --> 01:03:54,208
So, a person gets killed
through god's oracle.

736
01:03:55,209 --> 01:03:58,209
That's what I believe it means.

737
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,200
On the right side
we have the same thing.

738
01:04:08,001 --> 01:04:11,801
This has the same meaning
as it did before.

739
01:04:12,002 --> 01:04:15,002
The oracle of god's orders.

740
01:04:16,703 --> 01:04:19,703
However, this here...

741
01:04:21,504 --> 01:04:25,104
...probably means some
sort of great calamity.

742
01:04:25,405 --> 01:04:29,805
It could be a natural disaster or
something involving human action.

743
01:04:30,106 --> 01:04:34,706
We can say it is a great disaster
that stems directly from here.

744
01:04:35,607 --> 01:04:39,607
A great calamity
that was ordered by god.

745
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,600
I believe that's the meaning.

746
01:04:47,601 --> 01:04:51,401
<i>Later on, Kurosawa-san
went up to Kutoro Rock,</i>

747
01:04:51,602 --> 01:04:55,402
<i>but he said he was unable
to find the hole or the stone.</i>

748
01:04:59,403 --> 01:05:04,003
<i>Production staff came to the office
while Eno-kun was out working.</i>

749
01:05:11,004 --> 01:05:13,604
He's not here.

750
01:05:18,005 --> 01:05:20,605
Can I open it?

751
01:05:20,906 --> 01:05:25,306
<i>We'll search his bag to find out
contents of Eno-kun's "ceremony".</i>

752
01:05:28,607 --> 01:05:31,407
There's something here.

753
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,400
There are several things inside.

754
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:41,801
He has a lot of money.

755
01:05:42,002 --> 01:05:45,802
There's 700,000 yen in his account.
(Aproximately $8,600 USD)

756
01:05:46,003 --> 01:05:49,603
He can rent an apartment
with 700,000.

757
01:05:50,104 --> 01:05:53,704
So he's making
how much in a month?

758
01:05:54,405 --> 01:05:57,805
He hasn't whithdrawn any money?
- No.

759
01:05:58,006 --> 01:06:01,206
It looks like he's been
preparing for something.

760
01:06:01,407 --> 01:06:04,207
Preparing for what?

761
01:06:05,608 --> 01:06:09,008
Perhaps something
like a mass murder?

762
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,400
<i>Eno-kun is recording after
everyone left today's work.</i>

763
01:06:14,601 --> 01:06:18,001
You, come here.
What's your name? - Eno.

764
01:06:18,202 --> 01:06:21,202
<i>Group leader had
his eye on Eno-kun.</i>

765
01:06:21,403 --> 01:06:25,003
Get your shit together and
start doing your job well.

766
01:06:25,204 --> 01:06:28,804
- I am doing my job well.
- What do you mean doing it well?

767
01:06:30,606 --> 01:06:34,606
If I'm telling you to do it well,
it's fucking obvious that you're not.

768
01:06:35,007 --> 01:06:38,807
You know very well we are falling
behind and it's all because of you.

769
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,200
What are you talking about?

770
01:06:43,601 --> 01:06:46,201
Don't come tomorrow.

771
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:50,702
I am coming to work tomorrow.
I have been doing my job well.

772
01:06:51,503 --> 01:06:54,503
If you come, you know what's up.

773
01:07:06,004 --> 01:07:09,804
In my head I see him
getting hit by a car soon.

774
01:07:10,005 --> 01:07:13,405
Must be a premonition or something.

775
01:07:13,606 --> 01:07:16,606
But there's no way in hell

776
01:07:16,807 --> 01:07:20,207
I'm letting that fucker
know about it.

777
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,800
Look at that thing
on top of him. Creepy!

778
01:07:39,401 --> 01:07:41,801
What the...?

779
01:07:46,802 --> 01:07:50,002
I could not have done that.

780
01:07:51,003 --> 01:07:54,403
But I knew it was going to happen.

781
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:58,804
I haven't done anything bad.

782
01:08:08,805 --> 01:08:12,005
I feel something here,
in this area.

783
01:08:12,206 --> 01:08:15,606
I'll see if I can get
something on camera.

784
01:08:15,807 --> 01:08:19,207
There's something
strange in this area.

785
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,200
There, there!
It can be seen clearly!

786
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,201
Whoa, what the...?

787
01:08:31,602 --> 01:08:34,202
It disappeared.

788
01:08:35,803 --> 01:08:40,003
Did you see that, Shiraishi-kun?
That was really something, eh?

789
01:08:40,804 --> 01:08:44,404
I'm here in a shoping area, waiting.

790
01:08:46,005 --> 01:08:49,405
I'll try and look around this area.

791
01:08:51,406 --> 01:08:55,406
Whoa, there they are!
Look at that!

792
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:04,007
How about it, Shiraishi-kun?
There are so many!

793
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,100
This is great!

794
01:09:12,001 --> 01:09:14,701
There are several.

795
01:09:20,002 --> 01:09:23,802
People don't even notice
but there are many of those.

796
01:09:28,203 --> 01:09:30,803
That was amazing.

797
01:09:38,004 --> 01:09:41,004
Whoa, that's huge!

798
01:09:48,705 --> 01:09:52,305
Did you see that,
Shiraishi-kun? Amazing!

799
01:09:53,006 --> 01:09:55,006
Amazing!

800
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,000
<i>Eno-kun's footage
left us speechless.</i>

801
01:10:04,601 --> 01:10:07,801
- That is...
- Impressive?

802
01:10:08,502 --> 01:10:12,702
Yes, impressive. What happened
to the guy who was hit by the car?

803
01:10:12,903 --> 01:10:15,303
Is he alright?

804
01:10:15,504 --> 01:10:18,704
I don't know what
happened to him afterwards.

805
01:10:18,905 --> 01:10:22,105
I saw an ambulance coming.

806
01:10:22,506 --> 01:10:25,506
- You had a premonition, right?
- That's right, I did.

807
01:10:25,707 --> 01:10:28,907
- You didn't cause any of this?
- No, I don't have that ability.

808
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,400
There was something strange
hovering over his head.

809
01:10:35,001 --> 01:10:37,801
What was that?

810
01:10:38,202 --> 01:10:41,202
I've never seen
those shapes before.

811
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:44,803
It's a new type of phenomenon?
- Yeah, it's a new type.

812
01:10:45,004 --> 01:10:48,004
But you saw it's real.
- That's right.

813
01:10:48,205 --> 01:10:51,605
It's no big deal, but it
surprised you, didn't it?

814
01:10:51,806 --> 01:10:54,206
Well... yes.

815
01:10:54,807 --> 01:10:57,807
So how about it? - Huh?

816
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,600
How about "it"?

817
01:11:01,601 --> 01:11:04,001
- The fee?
- Yes.

818
01:11:04,202 --> 01:11:08,002
Of course I'm gonna pay you.
You took all this in one evening?

819
01:11:08,203 --> 01:11:10,703
Yes, all in one evening.

820
01:11:10,904 --> 01:11:15,104
Since it took you several hours,
I will pay for those. - Really?

821
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,200
Do you have an envelope?

822
01:11:18,401 --> 01:11:22,201
Don't worry about that.
No need to be formal.

823
01:11:22,602 --> 01:11:25,802
I'm happy just receiving the money.

824
01:11:26,003 --> 01:11:30,003
Did you make a receipt?
Please write in 23,000 yen.

825
01:11:30,204 --> 01:11:32,804
Oh, am I getting that much?

826
01:11:33,005 --> 01:11:36,405
The voice that was
talking to you before,

827
01:11:36,606 --> 01:11:39,406
the one you didn't understand,

828
01:11:39,607 --> 01:11:42,607
was it alerting you to any of this?

829
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:46,408
No, because I don't
understand what it says.

830
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,300
Can I really keep this?
- It's fine, it's fine.

831
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:55,601
Since you've gone through the trouble,
I'll treat you to Korean barbecue.

832
01:11:57,502 --> 01:12:00,302
All of us, let's go.

833
01:12:01,403 --> 01:12:04,803
I can't make it today.
I have other plans.

834
01:12:05,204 --> 01:12:08,004
Don't tell me you have a date.

835
01:12:08,205 --> 01:12:11,205
Really, I have other plans.

836
01:12:11,806 --> 01:12:14,806
I already ate. Sorry.

837
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:20,607
Is it okay if I go with you?

838
01:12:20,808 --> 01:12:23,608
- You're coming?
- Yes, the two of us.

839
01:12:23,809 --> 01:12:27,209
Sure. After all, I got this
money because of you.

840
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,200
<i>This is my chance to get Eno-kun
to talk about his ceremony.</i>

841
01:12:37,001 --> 01:12:40,001
When I saw today's footage,

842
01:12:41,202 --> 01:12:45,002
I was truly able
to believe everything.

843
01:12:46,003 --> 01:12:50,403
Eno-kun, I don't know what
kind of ceremony will take place.

844
01:12:51,104 --> 01:12:54,904
Even if what you're
going to do is something...

845
01:12:55,805 --> 01:13:00,005
...very antisocial or
even if you are going to...

846
01:13:00,806 --> 01:13:04,606
Even if it's something
like Matsuki-san did,

847
01:13:04,907 --> 01:13:09,307
I'm thinking that I would
like to cooperate with you.

848
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:14,200
Do you really mean it?

849
01:13:14,501 --> 01:13:18,501
Of course, I really mean it.
I really do.

850
01:13:20,302 --> 01:13:24,302
In short, with this production,
with this movie I'm making,

851
01:13:25,003 --> 01:13:29,003
you can see how many things
have become connected.

852
01:13:29,304 --> 01:13:33,304
Once it's completed, I think
it can show a lot of people

853
01:13:33,705 --> 01:13:37,705
that this world beyond ours
really does exist.

854
01:13:38,606 --> 01:13:42,406
I thought that was the order
that was given to me.

855
01:13:44,007 --> 01:13:47,607
I see. I understand that.

856
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:52,800
<i>Then, finally,
Eno-kun began to talk.</i>

857
01:13:54,801 --> 01:13:57,801
The truth is that
after the incident,

858
01:13:58,002 --> 01:14:00,802
I was hearing a voice.

859
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:04,803
I told you that I couldn't
understand what it was saying.

860
01:14:05,004 --> 01:14:08,404
But I could understand it.
- I knew it!

861
01:14:09,205 --> 01:14:13,005
That voice that sounded
like **** was saying...

862
01:14:13,606 --> 01:14:16,406
What was it saying?

863
01:14:18,007 --> 01:14:22,207
It said: "a suicide bombing
massacre at the Shibuya station."

864
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,400
Suicide bombing?

865
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:28,801
Don't shout like that,
people are gonna hear you.

866
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:37,202
<i>A suicide bombing massacre
at the Shibuya Station</i>

867
01:14:41,303 --> 01:14:44,003
This is my order.

868
01:14:44,304 --> 01:14:47,504
Just as it was with Matsuki.

869
01:14:47,805 --> 01:14:51,805
Remember, he jumped into the sea
and went into another dimension.

870
01:14:52,206 --> 01:14:55,206
It will be the same with me.

871
01:14:55,607 --> 01:15:00,407
Even if I become a suicide
bomber, I will not die.

872
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I won't die, but rather...

873
01:15:04,401 --> 01:15:08,001
go into the other dimension
through the bomb.

874
01:15:08,602 --> 01:15:12,202
So when the bomb goes off,
at that same moment

875
01:15:12,403 --> 01:15:16,003
your body will go into that
other world without harm?

876
01:15:16,204 --> 01:15:20,404
Yes, into the other world. People
around me will be able to go, too.

877
01:15:20,605 --> 01:15:23,605
God's people will be able to go.

878
01:15:23,806 --> 01:15:27,406
Matsuki was a chosen person.
I am a chosen person.

879
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,400
And I'm thinking that
you are chosen as well.

880
01:15:32,001 --> 01:15:35,801
The point is that
as a chosen person,

881
01:15:36,602 --> 01:15:39,602
I must obey that command.

882
01:15:40,203 --> 01:15:45,003
I must apologize to you cause you
let me stay in your office and all...

883
01:15:45,404 --> 01:15:49,604
but I've been saving money for this,
and I have about 700,000 yen now.

884
01:15:49,905 --> 01:15:53,505
You managed to save this
little by little? - Yes, I did.

885
01:15:54,406 --> 01:15:58,106
Now I have enough funds to
walk into the Shibuya station

886
01:15:58,307 --> 01:16:01,707
during the rush hour,
and then boom!

887
01:16:03,508 --> 01:16:06,908
- Will you make the bomb?
- Yeah, I'll make the bomb.

888
01:16:07,309 --> 01:16:10,509
I've been studying
how to make one.

889
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:13,100
When will you do it?

890
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:17,501
I thought I'd need more money,
but ever since I met you,

891
01:16:17,902 --> 01:16:22,102
since you're willing to help
and you can film all of it,

892
01:16:22,603 --> 01:16:25,603
maybe now it's time to do it.

893
01:16:27,804 --> 01:16:30,604
Can I eat the last one?

894
01:16:32,005 --> 01:16:34,405
It will go well.

895
01:16:34,906 --> 01:16:38,106
So, you will go to Shibuya...

896
01:16:38,607 --> 01:16:42,807
<i>Eno-kun will blow himself up
along with the people around him.</i>

897
01:16:43,108 --> 01:16:45,808
That is your ceremony?

898
01:16:46,009 --> 01:16:48,509
Yes, that's it.

899
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:53,200
You know, when I told you
I will cooperate with you?

900
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:55,901
It was a lie.

901
01:16:56,402 --> 01:16:59,202
I lied to you. - Why?

902
01:16:59,403 --> 01:17:03,003
I lied in order to get
the truth out of you.

903
01:17:03,804 --> 01:17:06,404
You tricked me?

904
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:10,705
Did you trick me?
I thought you were my friend.

905
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:14,406
Why would you do that?

906
01:17:14,907 --> 01:17:17,907
As a friend,
I can't let you do that.

907
01:17:18,108 --> 01:17:21,108
I don't want you
to become a murderer.

908
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:25,600
But I won't be a murderer!
We'll all go to the other world.

909
01:17:26,001 --> 01:17:30,201
You can go over to
the other world if you wish.

910
01:17:31,002 --> 01:17:35,802
But isn't it wrong
to drag along other people...

911
01:17:37,203 --> 01:17:41,203
...who don't want to go?

912
01:17:42,604 --> 01:17:45,804
You're not being my friend.

913
01:17:46,005 --> 01:17:50,005
And those people... they're
not going to die, either.

914
01:17:50,406 --> 01:17:54,006
Even if you say they won't die,

915
01:17:54,407 --> 01:17:59,407
isn't it wrong to take them
with you if they don't wanna go?

916
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:03,408
You see, this has nothing
to do with dying.

917
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:07,209
They'll be able to go beyond
to heaven, to god's world.

918
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:10,900
But you're still imposing
your will on those people.

919
01:18:11,101 --> 01:18:14,001
I told you already.
It's not my will.

920
01:18:14,202 --> 01:18:17,202
They won't know
unless they go there.

921
01:18:17,403 --> 01:18:21,003
Once you get there, what if
it's not what you thing it will be?

922
01:18:21,204 --> 01:18:24,404
That world is much better
than this one.

923
01:18:24,605 --> 01:18:27,605
This world is just shit, isn't it?

924
01:18:27,806 --> 01:18:32,406
Shiraishi-kun, if you try to stop me
you will recieve a punishment.

925
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:36,207
Something will happen
to you, for sure.

926
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,000
- By whom? God?
- Yes, God will punish you.

927
01:18:41,601 --> 01:18:44,801
I have to tell the rest
of the staff about this.

928
01:18:45,102 --> 01:18:49,002
Do what you want. Tell them.
But something will happen.

929
01:18:50,303 --> 01:18:54,303
Shiraishi-kun, are you leaving?
- I'm not going anywhere.

930
01:18:58,604 --> 01:19:01,604
Something will happen.

931
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:07,905
Come on! I promise you
that nothing's gonna happen.

932
01:19:08,206 --> 01:19:12,006
Something will happen. Please,
God, make something happen.

933
01:19:12,207 --> 01:19:15,807
God doesn't sympathize
with your feelings, Eno-kun.

934
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,900
Nothing has happened, Eno-kun,
not even a glass has moved.

935
01:19:20,302 --> 01:19:24,102
Shiraishi-kun, that doesn't mean
it will stay this way.

936
01:19:24,303 --> 01:19:26,903
Something will happen.

937
01:19:27,204 --> 01:19:30,004
- Eno-kun?
- Why?

938
01:19:33,405 --> 01:19:36,405
You traitor! You liar!

939
01:19:37,206 --> 01:19:39,606
I know, I know.

940
01:19:39,807 --> 01:19:43,807
What's with you? I told you
everything because I trusted you.

941
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:53,200
But you... you're so cruel.

942
01:19:54,601 --> 01:19:57,001
I know, I know.

943
01:19:57,402 --> 01:19:59,402
Okay?

944
01:20:26,403 --> 01:20:28,603
Wait!

945
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:45,204
Shiraishi-kun, a miracle happened.

946
01:20:46,405 --> 01:20:49,605
You know what your mission is.

947
01:20:51,406 --> 01:20:54,206
I don't know for sure, but...

948
01:20:54,507 --> 01:20:57,907
...you too must have
god's mark on you.

949
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:02,200
My leg. My leg.

950
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:10,601
See? Just as I thought.

951
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:16,802
You understand what is
your mission, don't you?

952
01:21:17,103 --> 01:21:20,703
Your mission is to film and
keep a record of everything.

953
01:21:21,004 --> 01:21:24,504
You are to present that
to the world.

954
01:21:29,405 --> 01:21:31,405
Come.

955
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:36,206
Shiraishi-kun!

956
01:21:41,207 --> 01:21:46,207
<i>And so, I decided to leave a record
of Eno-kun's ceremony.</i>

957
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:54,200
<i>In order to increase the damage
the bomb will cause,</i>

958
01:21:54,401 --> 01:21:57,601
<i>he buys lots of nails and screws.</i>

959
01:22:00,602 --> 01:22:05,202
<i>He buys chemicals and raw
materials to make a gunpowder.</i>

960
01:22:14,203 --> 01:22:16,803
It's super heavy.

961
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:21,204
Carrying this I realize that
bombing belt will be very heavy.

962
01:22:21,505 --> 01:22:23,905
That's right.

963
01:22:24,206 --> 01:22:26,806
Like carrying a burden.

964
01:22:27,007 --> 01:22:30,007
Camera will be even heavier.

965
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:36,200
You! Tell me what are you
carrying there?

966
01:22:36,501 --> 01:22:38,901
It's hell!

967
01:22:42,202 --> 01:22:44,702
I know what's up!

968
01:22:45,003 --> 01:22:47,803
Stop, please!
It's inhuman!

969
01:22:48,304 --> 01:22:51,704
You think yourself a hero?
Are you going...?

970
01:22:58,705 --> 01:23:01,305
Please, stop this!

971
01:23:08,606 --> 01:23:11,006
It's hell!

972
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,200
Why was he trying to take it?

973
01:23:20,401 --> 01:23:22,901
I don't know.

974
01:23:24,802 --> 01:23:27,402
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

975
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:31,203
This world is full of...

976
01:23:35,204 --> 01:23:38,004
...fucking loonies.

977
01:24:37,805 --> 01:24:41,605
They're all piled like
a rucksack or a backpack.

978
01:24:41,806 --> 01:24:45,606
I'll try and wear it.
Shiraishi-kun, help me.

979
01:24:45,807 --> 01:24:50,007
You know, like wives helping
their husbands to put on a shirt.

980
01:24:50,408 --> 01:24:56,008
Oh, I see. I can also help you
when we arrive at the location.

981
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,100
Okay.

982
01:25:00,001 --> 01:25:02,401
This is heavy.

983
01:25:02,602 --> 01:25:06,202
Do I pick it up like this,
or from under it?

984
01:25:07,403 --> 01:25:10,003
Pick it up like it is.

985
01:25:10,204 --> 01:25:12,604
Here I go.

986
01:25:20,005 --> 01:25:22,605
Bend a little.

987
01:25:29,006 --> 01:25:32,506
- Does it suit me?
- It does. You look cool.

988
01:25:32,907 --> 01:25:35,707
- Very heroic.
- Really?

989
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:39,208
Can I borrow a video camera?

990
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,600
I want to bring a camera with me.

991
01:25:45,201 --> 01:25:49,601
I might be able to film
something from the other side.

992
01:25:51,202 --> 01:25:55,002
If I'm able to film something,
I'll send it over to you.

993
01:25:55,503 --> 01:25:57,703
Wait...

994
01:25:59,204 --> 01:26:02,604
Yes? Who is it?

995
01:26:02,905 --> 01:26:05,505
It's Shinobu.

996
01:26:05,806 --> 01:26:08,406
Wait, wait, wait!

997
01:26:09,807 --> 01:26:12,407
Wait a second!

998
01:26:12,808 --> 01:26:15,808
I'm sorry. Just a second.

999
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:24,400
Oh, you forgot something?
What did you forget?

1000
01:26:29,001 --> 01:26:33,001
Oh, your digital camera?
It must be here somewhere.

1001
01:26:33,202 --> 01:26:35,502
Wait a second.

1002
01:26:35,803 --> 01:26:39,003
There's still white powder here.

1003
01:26:41,004 --> 01:26:43,404
Can I come in?

1004
01:26:43,705 --> 01:26:47,305
Yes, yes! I'm sorry!
I forgot how to...

1005
01:26:48,806 --> 01:26:52,806
You can come in now.
- Was it so difficult?

1006
01:26:53,807 --> 01:26:57,407
I'm sorry, I was turning
the key the wrong way.

1007
01:26:57,608 --> 01:27:01,208
Weren't you filming outside today?

1008
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,800
No.

1009
01:27:04,201 --> 01:27:08,801
- Is Eno-san here?
- Today he had the day off.

1010
01:27:09,702 --> 01:27:13,302
I was taping his
regular day here and...

1011
01:27:15,703 --> 01:27:18,903
Did something happen here? -No.

1012
01:27:19,104 --> 01:27:21,304
And what is that?

1013
01:27:21,505 --> 01:27:24,705
I made a bed out of
a cardboard box.

1014
01:27:26,006 --> 01:27:30,406
I think this camera will do.
Is the battery charged?

1015
01:27:33,207 --> 01:27:35,607
Yep, it is.

1016
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:39,000
You seemed very busy.

1017
01:27:39,401 --> 01:27:41,601
My day...

1018
01:27:41,902 --> 01:27:44,902
Eno-kun had the day off,

1019
01:27:45,303 --> 01:27:49,703
so I thought that maybe
he would be lazing around and...

1020
01:27:50,604 --> 01:27:54,604
Have you seen any video
tapes lying around here?

1021
01:27:55,705 --> 01:27:58,105
No, that's...

1022
01:27:59,306 --> 01:28:03,306
- Those are not tapes!
- No, this is not it.

1023
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,800
Anyway, I just came
to get my stuff.

1024
01:28:10,501 --> 01:28:13,901
Keep up the hard work.
- Thanks.

1025
01:28:20,002 --> 01:28:24,602
I'm sorry I spilled the powder.
- You did spill a lot. Look at that.

1026
01:28:25,403 --> 01:28:29,103
That looks weird however
you look at it. - Indeed.

1027
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:32,304
I didn't know
how to wipe it properly.

1028
01:28:32,605 --> 01:28:35,005
What's this?

1029
01:28:35,806 --> 01:28:39,606
Look at this mess!
- Sorry, I couldn't help it.

1030
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:46,000
Man, that sucked! Kuribayashi
coming here all of the sudden.

1031
01:28:47,401 --> 01:28:50,501
Look, the switch is hanging.

1032
01:28:51,302 --> 01:28:55,102
- Man, yeah it does!
- That's not funny.

1033
01:28:55,403 --> 01:28:59,003
I know I shouldn't laugh,
but look at that switch.

1034
01:28:59,704 --> 01:29:02,904
It was hanging there in plain view!

1035
01:29:03,205 --> 01:29:07,605
You can't help but laugh.
But it's over so don't worry.

1036
01:29:09,606 --> 01:29:13,206
<i>It's the morning of
the ceremony execution.</i>

1037
01:29:13,407 --> 01:29:17,207
<i>Eno-kun and me spent
the night drinking in Shibuya.</i>

1038
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:21,800
Man, at last!

1039
01:29:22,101 --> 01:29:25,701
<i>11 hours and 18 minutes
until the ceremony</i>

1040
01:29:30,402 --> 01:29:34,202
- Eno-kun, look at that!
- They are coming our way!

1041
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:38,703
That's amazing, Shiraishi-kun!

1042
01:29:41,204 --> 01:29:43,804
They're a bunch!

1043
01:29:47,805 --> 01:29:51,005
Wow, they are all coming our way!

1044
01:29:53,606 --> 01:29:57,206
- They are coming this way.
- Wow, they're coming.

1045
01:29:57,807 --> 01:30:01,007
They are coming towards me.

1046
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,400
They're all coming our way.

1047
01:30:06,701 --> 01:30:09,701
Why are there so many?

1048
01:30:13,002 --> 01:30:15,802
They come this way.

1049
01:30:17,003 --> 01:30:20,803
Shiraishi-kun, they are
coming in bunches.

1050
01:30:24,004 --> 01:30:27,204
They're all coming our way.

1051
01:30:29,405 --> 01:30:33,805
They're all coming in a bunch.
Wow, Shiraishi-kun, they're a lot.

1052
01:30:42,006 --> 01:30:46,006
<i>We get breakfast at
a gyuudon chain restaurant.</i>

1053
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:51,400
<i>11 hours and 2 minutes

1054
01:30:53,001 --> 01:30:57,201
<i>He avoids beef out of fear
of the mad cow disease.</i>

1055
01:31:03,202 --> 01:31:06,802
<i>We came back to the office
to catch some sleep.</i>

1056
01:31:15,003 --> 01:31:19,003
<i>6 hours and 30 minutes
before the ceremony</i>

1057
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:52,804
Can we get a taxi?

1058
01:31:54,805 --> 01:31:58,405
<i>5 hours and 13 minutes
before the ceremony</i>

1059
01:32:02,606 --> 01:32:05,406
To Shibuya, please.

1060
01:32:07,007 --> 01:32:10,607
- Any place in particular?
- Near the train station.

1061
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:15,600
Taxi drivers aren't making
that much money.

1062
01:32:17,401 --> 01:32:20,601
Like 3 or 5 million yen.
(36.000 - 61.000 $)

1063
01:32:20,802 --> 01:32:24,402
- Annual income?
- Yes. No good at all.

1064
01:32:24,903 --> 01:32:29,103
A lot of people are going through
Shibuya Station. - That's right.

1065
01:32:29,304 --> 01:32:32,904
It would be terrible if a terrorist
attack was to happen there.

1066
01:32:33,105 --> 01:32:35,705
I guess it would.

1067
01:32:40,206 --> 01:32:43,606
- Is it right?
- What?

1068
01:32:44,007 --> 01:32:46,207
This now.

1069
01:32:46,608 --> 01:32:49,008
It is right.

1070
01:32:49,409 --> 01:32:52,409
- Are we wrong?
- No, we're not wrong at all.

1071
01:32:52,810 --> 01:32:55,610
Thank you very much.

1072
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:35,600
- Where are we going?
- I know a good restaurant.

1073
01:33:36,201 --> 01:33:40,201
<i>4 hours and 6 minutes
until the ceremony</i>

1074
01:33:40,602 --> 01:33:44,202
- Indian cuisine?
- Yes, I go there sometimes.

1075
01:33:44,603 --> 01:33:47,203
I've never tried Indian food.

1076
01:33:47,504 --> 01:33:51,104
<i>I recommended that
we have Indian curry.</i>

1077
01:33:52,505 --> 01:33:54,905
- Is this it?
- Yes.

1078
01:33:55,106 --> 01:33:58,906
All you can eat for 1500 yen.
That's cheap! Shall we?

1079
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,000
This is good.

1080
01:34:10,201 --> 01:34:13,001
Indian curry is great.

1081
01:34:14,502 --> 01:34:17,302
Speaking of India...

1082
01:34:18,803 --> 01:34:22,403
...remember Indiana Jones?
- Indiana Jones?

1083
01:34:23,404 --> 01:34:27,604
His name has something to do
with India? - India... Indiana...

1084
01:34:28,005 --> 01:34:31,605
I think his name comes
from the State of Indiana.

1085
01:34:32,106 --> 01:34:35,906
Actually, they are showing a new
movie about him. - Are they?

1086
01:34:36,107 --> 01:34:39,707
Didn't you know?
It's one where Indy...

1087
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Let's go see it.
I'm a big fan of Indy.

1088
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:52,401
- Really?
- I really like him.

1089
01:34:53,502 --> 01:34:57,302
<i>We have to go to Kabukicho
to see the movie.</i>

1090
01:34:58,603 --> 01:35:01,003
This is it.

1091
01:35:05,404 --> 01:35:09,204
- Wasn't she in "Raiders"?
- She's in this one, too.

1092
01:35:09,505 --> 01:35:12,905
<i>3 hours and 39 minutes
before the ceremony</i>

1093
01:35:13,406 --> 01:35:16,406
I'll buy the tickets.
- Oh, really?

1094
01:35:16,607 --> 01:35:20,207
You've been paying for
everything else until now.

1095
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,400
We have enough time.

1096
01:35:26,601 --> 01:35:29,601
AFTER THE MOVIE
- It's amazing.

1097
01:35:30,002 --> 01:35:34,202
If you hadn't suggested that
we go to the Indian restaurant,

1098
01:35:34,403 --> 01:35:38,403
I wouldn't have remembered.
It's all connected, you know.

1099
01:35:39,204 --> 01:35:42,804
When I watched it
and saw what was in it,

1100
01:35:43,005 --> 01:35:47,005
it made me think that
this absolutely has a meaning.

1101
01:35:47,206 --> 01:35:50,706
This is a miracle, too.
- What, the timing?

1102
01:35:51,107 --> 01:35:55,107
Of course! You see, the movies
content was already decided,

1103
01:35:55,308 --> 01:35:58,108
but through it...
how shall I put it,

1104
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:02,300
through **** I'm pushed
forward to what has to be done.

1105
01:36:02,601 --> 01:36:06,201
Really, I'd love to watch it again.

1106
01:36:08,402 --> 01:36:12,602
But time doesn't allow it.
- Can't you postpone it a day?

1107
01:36:15,203 --> 01:36:17,803
No, I can't.

1108
01:36:18,404 --> 01:36:21,804
If I hadn't seen the movie,

1109
01:36:23,005 --> 01:36:26,005
I might have thought so, but...

1110
01:36:26,606 --> 01:36:29,806
<i>48 minutes before the ceremony</i>

1111
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:34,000
So, shall we go?

1112
01:36:44,001 --> 01:36:46,401
<i>Shibuya</i>

1113
01:36:48,802 --> 01:36:52,202

<i>6 minutes before the ceremony</i>

1115
01:37:59,204 --> 01:38:02,404
I'm going the next time
traffic lights change.

1116
01:38:02,605 --> 01:38:05,805
I'll start recording now.
It's recording.

1117
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:12,900
Shiraishi-kun, I never paid you back
100 yen I borrowed from you.

1118
01:38:14,801 --> 01:38:18,401
- What 100 yen?
- At the internet café.

1119
01:38:19,202 --> 01:38:23,402
I borrowed 100 yen from you.
- Oh, that time in the beginning.

1120
01:38:24,003 --> 01:38:26,503
I'll give them back.

1121
01:38:27,604 --> 01:38:31,204
Excuse me, do you have 100 yen?
- Ah, sure.

1122
01:38:35,005 --> 01:38:37,405
I appologize.

1123
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:42,200
It's a little late, but here you are.
- Well, I tell you what...

1124
01:38:42,801 --> 01:38:46,601
You take those 100 yen
along with the camera,

1125
01:38:47,602 --> 01:38:51,202
and send them both to me
from the other side.

1126
01:38:54,603 --> 01:38:57,603
It will be more fun that way.

1127
01:38:58,204 --> 01:39:00,804
It's a deal.

1128
01:39:07,405 --> 01:39:10,405
I'm not sure if this will go well.

1129
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,000
<i>1 minute before the ceremony</i>

1130
01:39:15,701 --> 01:39:18,401

1131
01:39:19,202 --> 01:39:22,002
Thanks for everything.

1132
01:39:39,803 --> 01:39:43,603
Shiraishi-san, I've been
following two of you all day.

1133
01:39:44,004 --> 01:39:48,004
What have you been doing?
Would you care to explain?

1134
01:39:48,305 --> 01:39:52,505
I don't understand any of this!
He's gonna do something, isn't he?

1135
01:39:52,806 --> 01:39:56,306
- Get in here!
- Don't you touch me!

1136
01:39:56,607 --> 01:40:00,207
What are you planning to do?
I'm gonna call the police.

1137
01:40:00,408 --> 01:40:03,408
Don't stand there!
It's dangerous! Get in here!

1138
01:40:03,609 --> 01:40:07,409
- I'm calling them.
- Get in here! It's dangerous.

1139
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:11,510
Hello? Is this the police?
I'm calling from Shibuya Station.

1140
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,800
<i>The bombing in front of
the Shibuya train station</i>

1141

1142
01:40:41,902 --> 01:40:45,902
<i>The remains of Eno-kun
were never found.</i>

1143
01:40:49,003 --> 01:40:52,603
<i>I was convicted of complicity.</i>

1144
01:40:59,604 --> 01:41:02,604
<i>21 years later</i>

1145
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,600
- Hello.
- It's been a long time.

1146
01:41:25,401 --> 01:41:28,601
Hello. We finally meet again.

1147
01:41:29,402 --> 01:41:32,802
Thank you very much. Cheers!
- Cheers!

1148
01:41:36,003 --> 01:41:38,603
Let's cook these.

1149
01:41:41,704 --> 01:41:45,704
This redbush tea is very good.
- It is, isn't it?

1150
01:41:46,605 --> 01:41:50,205
Nowadays when you order tea
in bars and restaurants,

1151
01:41:50,406 --> 01:41:53,406
instead of oolong,
they serve you redbush tea.

1152
01:41:53,807 --> 01:41:56,607
So, oolong tea isn't served often?

1153
01:41:56,808 --> 01:41:59,808
No, lately it's not served at all.

1154
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:08,400
- This place is good, isn't it?
- This is really good.

1155
01:42:08,801 --> 01:42:12,201
It's been ages. Do people
still use that expression?

1156
01:42:12,402 --> 01:42:15,002
- Yes, they still do.
- Oh, they do?

1157
01:42:15,203 --> 01:42:18,203
- Yes, occasionally.
- Oh, so it has survived?

1158
01:42:19,304 --> 01:42:23,104
This place is relaxing.
It hasn't changed much.

1159
01:42:24,005 --> 01:42:26,805
It hasn't changed, but...

1160
01:42:27,706 --> 01:42:31,506
it will stop serving this month.
They're closing it down.

1161
01:42:33,707 --> 01:42:36,307
Oh, is that so?

1162
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,400
So I barely made it, eh?

1163
01:42:39,601 --> 01:42:41,801
Yes. Well...

1164
01:42:42,002 --> 01:42:46,202
The beef imported from the U.S.
was infected with mad cow disease,

1165
01:42:46,403 --> 01:42:49,203
and 100,000 people died in Japan.

1166
01:42:51,004 --> 01:42:55,004
What... are you serious?
100.000? That's incredible.

1167
01:42:56,005 --> 01:42:59,705
So many barbecue restaurants
closed down.

1168
01:43:00,106 --> 01:43:03,906
<i>We pray for the souls of those
murdered in Myogasaki and Shibuya.</i>

1169
01:43:04,107 --> 01:43:06,707
- That's really sad.
- It is.

1170
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,600
My leg!

1171
01:43:18,901 --> 01:43:21,901
My leg is bleeding.

1172
01:43:24,402 --> 01:43:26,802
What is this?

1173
01:43:34,803 --> 01:43:36,803
What?!

1174
01:43:40,204 --> 01:43:42,404
Oh, no!

1175
01:43:53,305 --> 01:43:55,305
This...

1176
01:43:55,806 --> 01:43:59,606
...is the camera that Eno-kun
was carrying at that time.

1177
01:44:00,207 --> 01:44:02,407
And this...?

1178
01:44:03,008 --> 01:44:05,608
It's a 100 yen coin.

1179
01:44:05,909 --> 01:44:09,109
It's an old coin. They don't
issue those anymore.

1180
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:22,110
He remembered.

1181
01:44:36,600 --> 01:44:41,400
Shiraishi-kun, I never paid you back
100 yen I borrowed from you.

1182
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:45,701
It's a little late, but here you are.
- Well, I tell you what...

1183
01:44:46,002 --> 01:44:50,202
You take those 100 yen
along with the camera,

1184
01:44:51,003 --> 01:44:55,203
and send them both to me
from the other side.

1185
01:45:00,404 --> 01:45:03,404
It will be more fun that way.

1186
01:45:04,005 --> 01:45:06,605
It's a deal.

1187
01:45:12,606 --> 01:45:15,406
Thanks for everything.

1188
01:46:15,607 --> 01:46:18,007
<i>"It's hell!"</i>

1189
01:46:19,808 --> 01:46:22,208
<i>"It's hell!"</i>

1190
01:46:28,909 --> 01:46:31,309
Shiraishi-kun!

1191
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:33,710
Help me!

1192
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
