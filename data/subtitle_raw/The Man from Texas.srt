I wouldn't go if I
didn't have to, Zee.

But what about me,
not knowing if you're

8
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,429
ever going to come back alive?

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,529

Now you ain't going to
worry your mom, promise me.

I'll do my best to.

00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,759

expect us, and we've

got to respect their
boundaries, so we've

21
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,369
got to work out in the county.

when I come back I'll

buy you a satin bustle
with feathers on it.

You don't know what
I've been through.

at me all day telling me

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,719

and start people talking.

101

You can wear those diamonds.

102
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:48,569

my own money, right

after the Texas Pacific hold up.

104
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,899

All I need.

107
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,229
I'll send money regular.

108
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,089
And I'll send it back.

109
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,139
I can't take money from a man
I don't live with and respect,

110
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,090
can I?

111
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,799
There are a lot of folks
who're living together

112
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,030
that don't respect each
other, and they get on fine.

113
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,289
Eight years.

114
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,639
Eight years and it
has to end like this.

115
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,019
I owe the milkman 17 cents.

116
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,449

you asked me to marry you

117

on the [INAUDIBLE]

those children.

got to forget men.

123
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,149

without any father at all.

124
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:50,850
They will!

125
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:52,009

126
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,960

this house long ago.

I ain't [INAUDIBLE].

130

of this house to remember you.

136

137
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,230
I had to.

138
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:18,319
You were badly advised.

139
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,020
I had to!

140
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:20,399
You sure are.

141
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,609
I had to!

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,659
Oh, Ma, don't cry.

143

to live with you again.

145

Oh, Ma, you won't head up.

146
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,289
How could you go to church
and pray for guidance

147
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,809
when you live the
way you're doing?

148
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,429
You're right, Zee.

149
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,159
Nothing matters but you...
you and the children.

150
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,020
And I'm wrong.

151
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,959

152
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,239

Zee... a sacred vow in church.

again, so help me.

always promised you.

trunk back upstairs,

leaving after all.

159
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,279

thought I could do it.

160
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,279
I'll never leave you
again, Toby, never.

161
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,280

162
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,749
We're all here, now reverend.

163
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,789
Can we start.

164
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,419
Never saw a man so
anxious to get hitched.

165
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,299
If you'll just step
here and hold hands.

166
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
Thank you.

167
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,630
Pardon me, reverend.

168
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,499
Toby there's some strangers
riding down the road apiece,

169
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,329
and one of them's on a white mare.

170
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,309
Are you sure, Billy?

171
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,659
Getting surer every second.

172
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,350
Oh no.

173
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,320
No, you're not.

174
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:52,769
I got to, Zee.

175
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,999
Excuse me, reverend,
but we'll have

176
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,029
to finish this some other time.

177
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,970
Goodbye, son.

178
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,910
Goodbye, daughter.

179
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:58,329
Mind your mother.

180
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,739
If you don't hear
from me in a few days,

181
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,869
I'll tell you where we'll meet up.

182
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,189
I'm sorry, honey,
but I promise you

183
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,769
we'll have that
church wedding here.

184
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,810
Good luck, Toby.

185
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,769
I warned you to leave him.

186
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,470
I can't, ma.

187
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,400
He's my husband.

188
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,230
I love him.

189
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:25,930
Love him?

190
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:28,049
What kind of love can
you have for an outlaw?

191
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,089
Outlaw?

192
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,930
Well, who is he?

193
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,719
Why, he's the El
Paso Kid, reverend.

194
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,619
The El Paso Kid?

195
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,029
Don't take it so hard, Zee.

196
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,469
Toby's a good man.

197
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,929
And your marriage is
a good legal marriage.

198
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,899
Of course, the
justice of the peace

199
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,899
may not be as holy
as a church wedding.

200
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,799
But it's just as binding,
Zee... just as binding.

201
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,219
And you got two fine
children to prove it.

202
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,210
[GUNSHOTS]

203
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,130
[GUNSHOTS]

204
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,530
[GUNSHOTS]

205
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:49,549
(SINGING) Their honeymoon's
on a mountain trail.

206
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:54,769
'Cause it wasn't a
real church wedding,

207
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:00,569
they sky overhead
was their ceiling,

208
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:07,669
and the moss on the
ground was their bedding.

209
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:13,349
But The Kid, he vowed
by the stars above that

210
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,449
they'd have a real church wedding.

211
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:26,109
And sweet indoors where the
walls and floors and goose

212
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:33,179
feather quilts for their bedding.

213
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,519
She was left all
alone today in church,

214
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,919
when the sheriff broke
up their wedding.

215
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:51,809
On his bridal night no bride
in sight, just his self

216
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:56,910
and his horse for his bedding.

217
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,639
What do you plan on doing, now?

218
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,599
Don't you worry.

219
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,579
Billy, I'm going to
get me a new state.

220
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,639
Off 'n a train?

221
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,500
No.

222
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,119
Off'n a bank.

223
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,899
A bank?

224
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,769
That's more dangerous, Kid.

225
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,039
No, I've got a new way
to get money from a bank.

226
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,699
You have?

227
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,580
Yeah.

228
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:25,039
I'm going to borrow it.

229
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,919
Borrow it?

230
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,869
That's the newfangled-est
idea I ever heard of.

231
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,819
I guess I'll turn in.

232
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,249
Lending money from a bank.

233
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,200
I sure hope he ain't gone loco.

234
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:12,950
BANKER: Come in.

235
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,699
Well, what do you want?

236
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,259
I'd like to open an
account with your bank.

237
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,909
Do you want to make a deposit.

238
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,890
Well, not exactly.

239
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:25,669
It's the other way around.

240
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,259
I'd like to make a withdrawal.

241
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,569
Withdrawal?

242
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,769
Oh, I suppose you mean you
want a loan of some money.

243
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,929
Is that it?

244
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,700
Yes, sir.

245
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,769
That's just what I want to do.

246
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,719
Open and above board.

247
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,409
I'll give you my note.

248
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,549
Your note?

249
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,829
I could light cigars all day on
notes people want to give me.

250
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,909
How much money do
you expect to borrow?

251
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:47,800
$500.

252
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:51,819
500... that's all you want, eh?

253
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,769
You got any collateral?

254
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,809
Nope, I ain't got any.

255
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,779
Just my word, and it's good.

256
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,229
I never broke it.

257
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,929
Is that so?

258
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,089
Well, I'll have to
confront my cashier

259
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,600
on this business matter.

260
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,569
Arthur?

261
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:08,609
Yes, Mr. [INAUDIBLE]

262
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:11,959
The gentleman here wants to
borrow $500 just on his word...

263
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:18,659
no collateral... you think
we ought to give it to him?

264
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,249
Well, do I get it?

265
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,309
Mister, where do you come
from, and what's your name?

266
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,239
I come from the Pecos country,
and my name's the El Paso Kid.

267
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,010
Oh!

268
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,319
The El Paso Kid!

269
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,419
Oh!

270
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,969
There's no need for ducking
in that [INAUDIBLE], Mister.

271
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,269
This is a business call.

272
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,409
Yes, Mr. Kid, yes.

273
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,699
$500 is all you want, Mr. Kid?

274
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,400
That'll do.

275
00:15:39,401 --> 00:15:42,539
Arthur, give the gentleman $500.

276
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,159
Fine, fine, I'll give you my note.

277
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,059
Yes, yes that'll be all we need.

278
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,829
This bank feels very
friendly to you, sir,

279
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,649
and I hope that you'll feel
friendly to the bank, Mr.

280
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,350
Heath.

281
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,959
I sure do.

282
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,660
Hurry up.

283
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,209
Hurry up.

284
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,289
Well, there you are... my note.

285
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,459
Deal is forward, all
legitimate, and above board.

286
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,579
Anything else?

287
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,540
Just one thing more.

288
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,299
I don't work around
here, and I want

289
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,759
you to keep this
transaction secret.

290
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,540
Is that agreed?

291
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,240
It's agreed.

292
00:16:07,241 --> 00:16:10,119
I won't tell anybody, Mr. Kid.

293
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,319
Well, I've got a lot of
riding to do before sundown,

294
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,270
so I'll get along.

295
00:16:13,271 --> 00:16:15,731
I'll see you in 90
days, if not sooner.

296
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,539
Ah, Arthur.

297
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,390
Get the sheriff.

298
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,129
That was the El Paso Kid.

299
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,419
Get somebody after him, you idiot!

300
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,469
Get somebody after him!

301
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,969
SONG: He's plan on
Sunday... he must

302
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,839
pray the whole day through.

303
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,769
But there's always
trains on Monday,

304
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,920
and the banks are open too.

305
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:03,309
With his good wife and
his kids around to play,

306
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,039
he thinks fondly of
the Monday, and the job

307
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,739
that he's planned that day.

308
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,419
And the next day,
and the next day...

309
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,869
he's dreaming fondly
on Sunday of the job

310
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,690
that he's planned next day.

311
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,919
I spoke to Miss
[INAUDIBLE]... real neighborly.

312
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,899
And they like us too, Toby.

313
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,229
That's a good name we've
got this time, Zee... Heath.

314
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,029
And we're going to keep it good.

315
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,900
Promise me, Toby.

316
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:43,429
Promise me you'll
never let it get bad.

317
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,489
Well, I'd hate to have
to change our name again.

318
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,479
It's so hard on the children.

319
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,119
They keep losing
track of who we are.

320
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,169
Now don't you fret, Zee.

321
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,629
That's going to be my
son's business someday.

322
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,069
And we're going to stay
right here in this town.

323
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,870
Pardon me.

324
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,780
Mr. Heath?

325
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,480
Why, yes sir?

326
00:17:59,481 --> 00:18:00,809
I couldn't make it
into town yesterday,

327
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:02,639
and I'm running
pretty short on feed.

328
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,219
I wonder if you'd mind opening
the store to help me out.

329
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,819
Mighty sorry, but
I can't do business

330
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,729
of any kind of business
on the Sabbath.

331
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,249
But here's the key just help
yourself to what you need.

332
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,469
Put the key under the mat there.

333
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,109
Well, that's very generous of you,

334
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,249
but leaving the key under the mat?

335
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,289
Neighbor, I've been in
this town for months.

336
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,859
These people are my friends.

337
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,760
Besides, who'd want to rob me.

338
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:33,449
You know, Zee, it was
sort of nice to walk

339
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,899
into a bank just
like any other man.

340
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,579
Quiet, not a hand up.

341
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,709
I kind of enjoyed it.

342
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,939
The more honest
your living becomes,

343
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,169
the more enjoyment you're
going to get out of it.

344
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:45,419
You're right, Zee, and
I'm going to keep it

345
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,479
that way as long
as I possibly can.

346
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,239
Toby, don't you mean forever?

347
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,239
Well, naturally I mean
forever... God willing

348
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,640
and business improves.

349
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,309
Well, good day Brother
Williams, Sister Williams.

350
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,010
Good day.

351
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:02,390
Good day.

352
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,090
Good day.

353
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,090
Good day.

354
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
[INAUDIBLE]

355
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,540
Billy.

356
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,369
Hello, Billy.

357
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,240
Howdy, John.

358
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,940
Howdy.

359
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,860
Jad.

360
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:16,269
Kid!

361
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,239
Seeing you again was
worth the long ride

362
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,929
and the chance I took coming here.

363
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,840
You sure look good, Kid.

364
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,740
Thanks, Jad.

365
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:23,209
You too, ma'am.

366
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,489
Thanks.

367
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,449
This is Jim Walsh,
got in just after me.

368
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,310
Howdy, Jim.

369
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,010
Howdy.

370
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,810
Sure glad to see you.

371
00:19:30,811 --> 00:19:32,749
I thought you'd ride into night.

372
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,619
Ma, this is Jim Walsh.

373
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,449
Jim can bunk with Jad.

374
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,949
Howdy, ma'am.

375
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,399
How are you?

376
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,699
Boys, glad to see you.

377
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,189
Jim... Jim's one of
my old friends, Ma.

378
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,559
Yes, the minute I saw
him I was sure of that.

379
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,659
Can I speak to you
for a moment, please?

380
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,899
I have company, Ma.

381
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,259
Hold it for a little while.

382
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,829
I can't hold it for
another minute, Mr. Heath.

383
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,819
It's got to be right now.

384
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,269
Pardon me, boys.

385
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,739
When she calls me by
one of my adopted names

386
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,540
she's upset about something.

387
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,580
Now, Zee...

388
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:11,259
What are they doing here,
Toby... those awful men?

389
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,309
Why the decent one
of the whole bunch

390
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,499
is poor Billy Taylor, and if he
stays around them much longer

391
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,519
he'll be just as bad as they are.

392
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,350
You're right, Zee.

393
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,569
I tell you what.

394
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,429
I'll send him away the
first chance I get.

395
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,319
I don't want him on my conscience.

396
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,809
You're going to ride
out again, aren't you?

397
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,419
Aren't you?

398
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,809
Please, Zee.

399
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,399
I was going to tell
you about that later.

400
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,669
But you promised me Toby.

401
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,669
We was going to keep the name
of Heath so sweet-smelling.

402
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,709
That's what I'm doing it for.

403
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,439
They hay and feed
business is all right,

404
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,809
but the money I got left
isn't enough to keep me going.

405
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,299
I only got enough
to pay off the bank.

406
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,929
And I got to have more and have it

407
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,649
quick, or the place will
be sold out from under me.

408
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,069
Then let it be sold out.

409
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,079
What about the people who
sold me my merchandise?

410
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,859
I gave them my word
I'd pay 'em back.

411
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,959
And I'm going to if it's
the last thing I do.

412
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,529
But you gave me your word too.

413
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,230
Yeah, I know.

414
00:20:57,231 --> 00:20:59,159
It's a sin to steal from one party

415
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,289
to pay back another party.

416
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,559
And after all the nice
friends we've made here.

417
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,519
And our children's friends.

418
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,089
Well, we'd just have to move on.

419
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,799
I'd rather move on than
to see you start in again.

420
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,439
This is the last time.

421
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,129
I promise.

422
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,019
When do we start?

423
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,869
Tomorrow morning at 5 o'clock.

424
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,539
Here's the route.

425
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,399
Here's where we're
aiming for, and here's

426
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,579
where we'll be... the lake,
west shore trail, right there.

427
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,849
Is it clear?

428
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,699
Mm-hmm.

429
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,569
It's a big job, boys.

430
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,189
We'll be shipping a lot
of money, back east.

431
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,659
That's all right, but I was
hoping it was an express office

432
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,519
in a fair-sized town...
a stagecoach, you see.

433
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,029
Why Jim it's getting so a fellow

434
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,459
can't walk down the streets of
a town with a few pistols on him

435
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,959
without attracting attention.

436
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,209
Is that right?

437
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,309
Sure is terrible what eastern
civilization is doing to man.

438
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,310
Yeah.

439
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,380
[GUNSHOTS]

440
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,360
Drop that gun.

441
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,859
Pull over there.

442
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,860
Hands up.

443
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,330
Hurry up.

444
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,219
Ain't nothing here.

445
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,149
I looked it over
from top to bottom.

446
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,589
Nobody would dare
give me a bad steal.

447
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,929
They must have
switched the shipping.

448
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,029
Come on, let's pull out of here.

449
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,320
We'll split up and
meet at my place.

450
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,479
Billy, you had better turn back.

451
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,489
Turn back?

452
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,389
Yeah, I don't want you
on my conscience no more.

453
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,779
You mean you don't want me
around you no more at all?

454
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,480
That's it.

455
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,329
You'd better get.

456
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,929
Goodbye, Billy.

457
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:40,039
But I ain't done nothing.

458
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,669
There's no reason for
you to treat me that way.

459
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,699
You got a girl?

460
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,919
No.

461
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,609
You had a girl once, didn't you?

462
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,279
I did once, a long time ago.

463
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,519
She was decent, wasn't she?

464
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,220
I don't know.

465
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:57,099
I didn't ask her.

466
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,409
Sure she was.

467
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,919
Now you go find her and marry her.

468
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,249
Have her cook your meals and
wash your clothes and bang

469
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,899
some sense into your
bones and keep you home.

470
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,259
I couldn't sleep in bed at
nights wonder where you was

471
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,759
and what load you took.

472
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,959
I'd get up and leave every...

473
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,710
Listen, you.

474
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:12,379
You get married and settle
down into family life,

475
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,279
or I'll knock you cold.

476
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,500
Now get going.

477
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,899
Hello?

478
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,900

00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Hello?

480
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,289
Howdy. [INAUDIBLE] Who are you?

481
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,589
What you doing?

482
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,290
Howdy, ma'am.

483
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,280
Good afternoon.

484
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:27,319
I knocked at the door...

485
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,729
What you want?

486
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,179
Just a little hospitality,
ma'am... a bite of supper.

487
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,499
A hunk of corn pone
and a cup of tea,

488
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,949
and a bit of hog
meat, if you got it,

489
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,149
sure would be a kind favor.

490
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,269
I've been riding a long way.

491
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,170
Get out!

492
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:39,979
The hunk of pone and the
bite of hog meat I got

493
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,879
is going to last me forever.

494

I'll pay, ma'am.

I'm liberal.

497
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,209
What you doing around here?

498
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,439
Just on my way to
meet some friends.

499
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,459
We're going to catch a
stage in the morning.

500
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,729
I've got nothing for you.

501
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,399
And I'm sick of men a-passing by,

502
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,149
and a-dropping in
and a-sitting 'round.

503
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,079
Now don't be scared of me, ma'am.

504
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,659
I don't aim to harm you.

505

I ain't never forgot
that mother's a woman.

A bite of hog meat a piece
of corn pone washed down

507
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:10,809
with a cup of tea would be
an act of charity, ma'am.

508
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,399
Well, welcome.

509
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,390

What's that for?

520
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,389
You ain't a-gonna give
me a great bit greenback

521
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,219
just for one meal of vittles?

00:26:57,131 --> 00:26:58,499

Oh, take it.

It's too much.

00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,819
Oh, howdy, Kid.

539
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,609
Well, I'll be.

540
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,819
Didn't I send you back, Billy?

541
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,720
Yeah.

542
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:57,799
I just wanted to say the trail's
bad going down... washouts.

543
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,329
Gotta be careful in the dark.

544
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,969
Another fellow just come up.

545
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,719
What, another one?

546
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,729
Widow Weeks, this
is Billy Taylor... a

547
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,969
Baptist in good standing.

548
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,479
And he's just going home.

549
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,029
Sure.

550
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,129
I'll be dagburned.

551
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,319
A gold watch.

552
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,959
Must have cost a heap of money.

553
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,009
I don't know just
what it did cost.

554
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,799
I got this watch off
a leading citizen.

555
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,919
Must have thought a lot of
you to give you all that.

556
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,859
If he didn't then, he's
thought a lot about me since.

557
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,979
You'll have to excuse me for
being so rough with you when

558
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,809
you come in, but I'm a
lone widow woman, and...

559
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,929
You must've had a good
man, you're mourning him so.

560
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,199
No.

561
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,169
He was the meanest,
despiting-est man

562
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,739
in the panhandle.

563
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,859
My pappy traded me
in marriage to him

564
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,969
for a mule when I was 14,
and from the wedding day

565
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,189
he just oozed cursedness.

566
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,259
Drunk up the corn and
wailed the young 'uns,

567
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,619
and you couldn't get
a clean set of drawers

568
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,009
onto his lazy bones...
not even of a Sunday.

569
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,579
How long you married to him?

570
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,509
Nine years?

571
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,609
How man young 'uns you got?

572
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,879
Nine.

573
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,199
He sure was a tough man.

574
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,389
Yeah Before he died, he
took this whole [INAUDIBLE]

575
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,889
and cabin down on
a piece of paper.

576
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,099
Some devil around here
showed him how to do it.

577
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:28,769
He got money for that piece
of paper and drunk it all up.

578
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,110
Now I can't pay back what he got.

579
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:41,359
Billy, I'm glad
you're here after all.

580
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,319
I should help her, but I can't.

581
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,900
Don't let her get
another cent out of me.

582
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,419
Sit, brother.

583
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,550
I'm sorry for your misery, ma'am.

584
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,529
Help yourselves.

585
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,989
We're waiting for you ma'am.

586
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,999
I ain't hungry.

587
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,729
You all eat.

588
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,189
Sugar's in the gourd.

589
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,499
What's the matter, ma'am?

590
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,669
Fella's coming
tomorrow to put me out.

591
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,819
I'm moving down the trail
without no place to move to.

592
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,679
I hate whining, but I'm lost.

593
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,569
That's terrible.

594
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,979
Don't you be so kind, Billy.

595
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,730
And don't you let me.

596
00:30:25,731 --> 00:30:29,329
All I got left I owe to the bank.

597
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,030
Now come on, ma'am.

598
00:30:30,031 --> 00:30:31,059
Set in.

599
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,940
Have some tea.

600
00:30:31,941 --> 00:30:34,339
It's good for sorrow and grief.

601
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,509
Tea's my only comfort since
my young 'uns got took away.

602
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,210
Who took 'em?

603
00:30:39,211 --> 00:30:43,199
His folks... said I couldn't
raise them all alone.

604
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
That's hard.

605
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,529
No schools around there.

606
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,530
No schools?

607
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,669
Ain't a Baptist
church within 50 miles.

608
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,819
No church You've
got to get them back.

609
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,520
Hold on, Kid.

610
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,420
Mind your own business.

611
00:30:58,421 --> 00:30:59,779
You've got to get them back.

612
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,849
How much do you owe anyway?

613
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:03,789
All my money there
is, I reckon... $200.

614
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,029
$200?

615
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,890
You see this?

616
00:31:06,891 --> 00:31:07,949
It's a receipt.

617
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,039
Now don't you let nobody
get it out of your hands,

618
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,099
because it'll be all you got.

619
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,029
You make that fellow that's
coming sign his name on it

620
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,860
before you pay him.

621
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:15,019
Say what?

622
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,079
You got any neighbors?

623
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,889
Old Man Gouty around the bend?

624
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:18,700
Men in his family?

625
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,660
Eight of them.

626
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:21,029
Well, get them all
in for witnesses.

627
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,519
You can't be too
careful in business.

628
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,269
What's the day of
the month, Billy?

629
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,859
Danged if I know.

630
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,810
I lost track.

631
00:31:27,811 --> 00:31:29,809
I know the year.

632
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,339
Well that buckaroo that's
coming for the money

633
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,349
can write it down.

634
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,250
What money?

635
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:34,479
-Yeah, what money?
I'm warning you.

636
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,310
Hold on, Kid.

637
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,929
I'm paying you're debt ma'am.

638
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,169
You're paying my...
how can I give it back?

639
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,369
You can't.

640
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,379
Now, don't you part with
this here until that buckaroo

641
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,649
signs that there.

642
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,009
Saints and Lord above us.

643
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,389
All the heavens above us.

644
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,199
Everything above us.

645
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,639
(SOBBING)

646
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,089
Me too.

647
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,509
I got a roof over my head.

648
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,869
I got a farm.

649
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,509
I got my young 'uns back.

650
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,820
The nine of them.

651
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:19,059
(SINGING) My darling, my darling,

652
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:25,639
I dreamed a dream
that's coming true...

653
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:36,679
just how to spend my life
with you, only with you.

654
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:47,789
Old moon is a [INAUDIBLE]
and old gal Nature's in tune.

655
00:32:47,790 --> 00:33:00,099
And no one to spy us in
case we two want to spoon.

656
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:12,279
My darling, my darling, I'll
always love you like I do.

657
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:21,490
Just two be loved right
back by you, just you.

658
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:53,189
(SINGING)

659
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,849
Billy, I wouldn't be surprised
if that stranger coming down

660
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,019
the trail ain't
the buckaroo that's

661
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,289
calling on the Widow
Weeks for his money.

662
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,179
Yeah, I reckon it is.

663
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,759
I'm going to rest right
here in the bushes.

664
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,939
What for?

665
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,489
The Good Book says, relieve the
weary traveler of his burden.

666
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,799
Huh?

667
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,769
I'm going to relieve him.

668
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,360
(SINGING)

669
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,229
Well, then did you
take possession?

670
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,819
I did not take
possession, Mr. Hickey.

671
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,820
Why not?

672
00:34:45,821 --> 00:34:47,419
For the pure and
simple reason that

673
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,739
the Widow Weeks paid up in full.

674
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,939
What?

675
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,199
$200?

676
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,699
Impossible.

677
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,479
Maybe so, but she had it.

678
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,190
She did, eh?

679
00:34:56,191 --> 00:34:57,279
Well, let's see it.

680
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,459
Hand it over.

681
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,349
Mr. Hickey, you'd
better sit down

682
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,899
and get a fresh
light on that cigar.

683
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,959
What are you driving at, Sam?

684
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,660
Well, I'll tell you.

685
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:06,719
I was held up.

686
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,650
That's what.

687
00:35:07,651 --> 00:35:09,289
Now don't joke with me, Sam.

688
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,989
I don't like jokes about money.

689
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,889
This ain't no joke, Mr. Hickey.

690
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,809
I was sure held up.

691
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,419
And I don't like it either.

692
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,739
You don't like it?

693
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,479
How do you think I like it.

694
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,499
I had that Widow Week's place
as good as sold... paper's drawn.

695
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,139
The bank would have
made all of $20.

696
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,840
Instead...

697
00:35:26,841 --> 00:35:28,389
Instead I nearly
got shot in the back.

698
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,509
Well, that's part of your job.

699
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,369
What, getting shot?

700
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,409
You swore in, didn't you?

701
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:33,869
Yes, and I'm going to swear out.

702
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,449
Well I'll tell you
one thing, this bank

703
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,389
ain't going to take no loss.

704
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,390
No sir.

705
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,649
Well, my family ain't going
to take the loss neither.

706
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,539
Where did she get that money?

707
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,869
All I know is what she said.

708
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,489
She got it off a passing Baptist?

709
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,899
What?

710
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,779
I've been president of
this bank for 30 years,

711
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,569
and I ain't never seen a
man pay that much money

712
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,749
for just passing a widow.

713
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,419
That fellow that held me up... he

714
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,239
must have known what I had on me.

715
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,499
What did he look like?

716
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,400
I don't know.

717
00:36:06,401 --> 00:36:07,729
He was behind me.

718
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:11,439
Couldn't you have
sneaked a quick look?

719
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,489
He asked me not to.

720
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,159
What'd his voice sound like?

721
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,529
It was right soft and friendly.

722
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:21,219
Friendly?

723
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,619
And another thing.

724
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,499
He must have put the widow up
to making me sign that receipt.

725
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,109
That's all she kept saying... sign

726
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,959
that receipt, sign that receipt.

727
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,779
Any witnesses to the signing?

728
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,799
Yep.

729
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,219
Eight.

730
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,919
Eight?

731
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,269
Sam, I'm not so sure
that you was held up.

732
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:46,650
I'm not so sure but what you
was drinking when [INAUDIBLE]

733
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,819
How much further?

734
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,709
Oh, I calculate about 10 miles.

735
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,949
10 miles from where?

736
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,729
I told you Jad, that bank
where I borrowed the money.

737
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,229
Ain't going back to any town
for a while, are you Kid?

738
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,289
I got to, Jad.

739
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:07,259
I got to pay off my note.

740
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,769
You're out of your head.

741
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,099
Ol' [INAUDIBLE] will
be looking for you.

742
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,569
Pay him back some other time.

743
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,489
Banks has got more money
than they deserve anyway.

744
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,089
It ain't the money, Jad.

745
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,089
It's my word.

746
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,199
Giving back money to a bank.

747
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,360
And with interest.

748
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,920
Where's the collector?

749
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:58,279
Sam, there's a lady
here to see you.

750
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
A lady?

751
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,190
It's the widow.

752
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:06,420
Oh, it is, then?

753
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:13,439
Arthur, ask the lady
to step into my office.

754
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,370
Yes, Mr. Hickey.

755
00:38:14,371 --> 00:38:18,369
Now, you sit down and shut up.

756
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,119
I'll get the truth out of her.

757
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,839
I know how to handle
these women... scare 'em.

758
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,880
Scare 'em stiff.

759
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,809
Good day, ma'am.

760
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,529
It's a great pleasure.

761
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,979
How are you feeling today?

762
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,609
I'm president Hickey,
here to help the ladies,

763
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,699
but they call me Pop.

764
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,549
Oh, yes, won't you sit down?

765
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,709
Allow me.

766
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:46,859
Now, let me help you
straighten things out.

767
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,159
I'm just here to get my recipe.

768
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,479
Then I'm going.

769
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,639
Yes, yes, certainly.

770
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,739
But before I can give you back
to the deed, or recipe as you

771
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,929
call it, I'd like to
ask you a few questions.

772
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,679
Sam here says he received
a sum of money from you.

773
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,169
Payment in full, I says.

774
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,569
He sure did.

775
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:07,279
Yes, but unfortunately on
the way back, he was held up

776
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,419
and lost it.

777
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,180
He was?

778
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,949
Well, I thought the
roads was safe, now.

779
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:16,259
It's been suggested to me
that the uh... the gentleman

780
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,779
who gave you this money
may have taken it back.

781
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,650
No, sir.

782
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:21,689
He weren't that kind.

783
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,859
He was a good-living Baptist.

784
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,949
I see.

785
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,709
Of course, if he did,
the transaction it void.

786
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,809
Is what?

787
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,109
Void.

788
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,219
What's that mean?

789
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,199
That you haven't paid a cent.

790
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,149
You mean to tell me that I
didn't give that welp no money?

791
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,079
I mean to say that
we'll have to investigate

792
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,509
whether you did or not.

793
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,549
Now if you'll let
me see Sam signed...

794
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,139
The stranger what
give me the money

795
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,449
say to hold onto that
recipe 'til the day I died.

796
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:48,459
He say he don't trust no banks.

797
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,969
And I reckon now he was right.

798
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,009
Oh, now surely.

799
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,109
You give me what I
come down here for.

800
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,429
I don't want no
more truck with you.

801
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,009
Now please let me see
that receipt... err recipe.

802
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,129
No.

803
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:01,099
He put his name to it,
and I'm a-keeping it.

804
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,179
Get it off her Sam,
you've got the right.

805
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,899
Well, I ain't so sure.

806
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,269
It depends on why she's got it.

807
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:11,219
I ain't lived alone and
helpless for nothing,

808
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,209
and any man aiming to take
my clothes of for a recipe

809
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,700
better not try it in a bank.

810
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,050
Hello.

811
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:43,800
Mr. Kid.

812
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:45,109
Put your hands down, brother.

813
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,820
I'm here on business.

814
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:48,229
That [INAUDIBLE] was real
fond of you in this bank.

815
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,210
They are?

816
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:50,539
Is Mr. Hickey the president in?

817
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,869
Yes, sir, inside.

818
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:53,269
You two wait here.

819
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:54,889
Just keep a friendly
eye on the door.

820
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,589
Anyone comes in, see that they
stay in until I transaction

821
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,590
my business.

822
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,240
Well, hello, hello.

823
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:09,699
How are you since I saw you last?

824
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,889
This is a friendly call.

825
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,969
Put your hands down.

826
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,059
Well, my note's due
today, ain't it?

827
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,950
Well, howdy.

828
00:41:16,951 --> 00:41:18,349
I dropped in to see about it.

829
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,769
I don't want you to get the
wrong impression of the El

830
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,099
Paso Kid in this
bank, Mr. Hickey.

831
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,249
It's treated me fair.

832
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,139
El Paso Kid?

833
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,369
Well, excuse me, ma'am for
addressing a perfect stranger,

834
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:31,879
but you here on business too?

835
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,099
Reckon I am.

836
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,279
Then I feel very [INAUDIBLE].

837
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,739
Let me make it brief.

838
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,440
Kid?

839
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,140
Hello.

840
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,140
Man wants to come in.

841
00:41:40,141 --> 00:41:42,689
Let him in.

842
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:43,699
Who the...

843
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,319
I reckon.

844
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,020
Is he in?

845
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,720
Yeah.

846
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,519
Don't let him out.

847
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,569
If you've got business, ma'am...

848
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,009
I paid this buckaroo.

849
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,219
He's a deputy.

850
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,789
Just a minute.

851
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:58,059
Pass me your arms
in a sociable way.

852
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,279
I'm not asking you for
your gun, Mr. Hickey.

853
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,689
We're friends.

854
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:03,499
Besides I can always tell a weapon

855
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,549
under a Prince Albert coat.

856
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,689
You were saying, ma'am?

857
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,239
I give him all my
money, and now he

858
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,299
says I didn't pay a cent.

859
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,469
I did not.

860
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,669
She paid me $200,
and I'll swear to it.

861
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,889
Anyway, they want to take my
clothes off to find the recipe.

862
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,429
No, no, no, no no,
she misunderstood.

863
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:20,130
I never...

864
00:42:20,131 --> 00:42:22,909
Women don't understand
business, Mr. Hickey.

865
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,879
My wife don't always
understand mine.

866
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,359
We're here to protect
widows, ain't we, Mr. Hickey?

867
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,230
Certainly sir, certainly.

868
00:42:28,231 --> 00:42:30,049
-After all, Mr.
Hickey, widows are

869
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,229
the backbone of this nation.

870
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,529
I think so, yes.

871
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,399
Then give her her
satisfaction piece,

872
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,979
and make it legal this time.

873
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,589
Unless you want me
to drop by later.

874
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,290
I can.

875
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:39,779
No.no, no, no...
that's not necessary.

876
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,949
Not at all necessary.

877
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:41,900
Kid?

878
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,850
Hello.

879
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:44,749
Two men coming in.

880
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,179
See if they're rich.

881
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,199
Yup, they are.

882
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,199
Then tell Jad to give them
some of those cigars we have,

883
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,549
so they can look back up
on [INAUDIBLE] street.

884
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:53,989
Sure, Kid.

885
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,949
Can I have some of
those cigars, Jad?

886
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,900
They're in my breast pocket.

887
00:43:09,899 --> 00:43:11,639
This looks legal, all right.

888
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,539
Here you are.

889
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,470
Thank you.

890
00:43:14,471 --> 00:43:16,849
Sure was a streak
of luck I met you.

891
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:17,999
I don't care who you be.

892
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,940
That's all right, ma'am.

893
00:43:18,941 --> 00:43:19,979
Excuse me.

894
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,389
Well, Hickey it's
business between us,

895
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,109
ain't it... you and me.

896
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:31,079
Here you are... $500 on my
note and $4.17 interest.

897
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,859
Oh, thank you Mr. Kid.

898
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,560
Count it.

899
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:34,979
No, I take your word for it.

900
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,879
That's pleasant to
here, but my word's good.

901
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,909
I keep it when I give it.

902
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:39,900
Count it.

903
00:43:39,901 --> 00:43:44,029
One, two, three,
four, five, and $4.17.

904
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:44,940
Correct.

905
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,640
My note?

906
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:47,239
Oh, yes, the note, yes.

907
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,949
I put that note, I think, in
this drawer somewhere or other.

908
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,979
Yes, and there it is.

909
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,809
There's your note.

910
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:56,570
Thank you.

911
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:57,270
Is that all?

912
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:58,739
I hope... I mean, I
think that's all, yes.

913
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,480
We're closed.

914
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,120
Closed.

915
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:00,820
We're square?

916
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:01,829
We're square.

917
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,399
That's good.

918
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,639
You know, Mr. Hickey,
folks don't understand me.

919
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,709
I always wanted to
trade with one bank

920
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,809
where I was welcome... come
and go like any other man.

921
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:11,369
I appreciate the favor.

922
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,679
I reckon we know each
other now, and we'll

923
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:17,049
go as peaceful as we come.

924
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:19,189
Say, I've had real pleasure
in our transaction,

925
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,939
and I want to count
you as a friend.

926
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,589
Thank you, Mr. Kid.

927
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:23,629
Just call me Kid.

928
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,269
You know, I never was so
surprised in my life, uh... Kid.

929
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:29,049
I said I would, didn't I?

930
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,050
Yes, but the bank didn't
understand it that way.

931
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:35,209
- You mean you didn't believe me?
- No.

932
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:35,320
I...

933
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,160
You didn't trust me?

934
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:36,860
I mean...

935
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:38,399
You don't mean you
thought it was a holdup?

936
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,669
Well, I suppose you must have seen

937
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,049
what the papers said about it.

938
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,719
No, I haven't read
the papers, I've

939
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,309
been away tending business.

940
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:46,439
I'm hard-up, Mr. Hickey.

941
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,969
But when I came
here today with a...

942
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,989
Hey, Kid, you out soon?

943
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:51,069
Yeah.

944
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:53,069
With a friendly feeling
to pay what I owed.

945
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:55,699
I regret the misunderstanding,
and I thank you.

946
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:57,239
I thought I signed my name and got

947
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,379
your promise it was
a secret transaction.

948
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,879
When I rode in before, all alone,

949
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,359
a private citizen, if you'd have
refused me, I'd a walked out.

950
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,289
I would, because I
didn't want any trouble.

951
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,489
I only asked you for a loan.

952
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:07,410
You lent me the money.

953
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:08,419
I understand now.

954
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:09,719
I understand.

955
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,849
No, you don't.

956
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,469
What you don't
understand is that I'm

957
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,359
at the head of my business, just
as you're at the top of yours.

958
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,039
And I take it as a personal insult

959
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,199
that the boys all over the country

960
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,030
have read about our deal.

961
00:45:19,031 --> 00:45:21,079
But you acted like an honest man.

962
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,679
That's just it, and what
do they think of me now?

963
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,169
That I'm losing my grip?

964
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:27,689
When it comes to letting
people believe I'd stoop to rob

965
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:31,229
a bank, and for $500, and
never touched the safe,

966
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,959
never cracked the plum?

967
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:33,740
Me?

968
00:45:33,741 --> 00:45:35,739
Well, a man's got his pride.

969
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,539
Now, Mr. Hickey, you
know your business,

970
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,049
but you don't know mine.

971
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,429
And I'm going to show
you the difference

972
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:41,729
between borrowing and a holdup.

973
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:42,430
Oh.

974
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:44,239
Raise your hands.

975
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:44,940
Move.

976
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:45,940
Outside.

977
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,579
Sit down.

978
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:56,239
Jad, I'm going to crack the
safe myself, personally.

979
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,059
This is the darndest,
friendliest visit I ever paid.

980
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,939
I'm going to vindicate
my honor aplenty.

981
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,619
Hello, ma'am, I forgot about you.

982
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,879
Billy, [INAUDIBLE] one lady out.

983
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,580
Thank you.

984
00:46:07,581 --> 00:46:08,640
God bless you.

985
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:24,930
Billy, get me a couple sticks of
dynamite out of my saddlebags.

986
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,920
Sheriff, I think they're
holding up the bank!

987
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,050
Get your horse!

988
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,850
Get out of here.

989
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,510
I'll try and get them off.

990
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,860
Split up, fellas.

991
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:04,859
Well, he didn't make it, Billy.

992
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,859
He ain't never going to make it.

993
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,509
Don't say that, Jad.

994
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:09,619
They'll never take the Kid.

995
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,620
You know they can't.

996
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:14,370
That was the Kid's way,
Billy... looking after us.

997
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,849
Somebody better Zee.

998
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:19,850
Come on.

999
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:30,639
Well, Jim when did you get back?

1000
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,759
[INAUDIBLE] How'd you
two get here alive?

1001
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,989
What?

1002
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,660
Ain't you seen the papers?

1003
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:43,639
Infamous desperado
pursued by heroic citizens

1004
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,589
after bold bank
robbery three days ago.

1005
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,119
In desperate flight.

1006
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,979
Trapped in the woods.

1007
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,479
Escape impossible.

1008
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,939
Surrounded.

1009
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:58,269
Now, if you hadn't sent me
home, I'd be with him now.

1010
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:01,869
Reward for the Kid mounting.

1011
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:03,309
Where's his missus?

1012
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,369
-Don't know.
No one here...

1013
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:06,229
What did you let him go
back to that bank for?

1014
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,799
Let him?

1015
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,119
You couldn't have stopped him.

1016
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,639
I never heard of such a thing...
borrowing money from a bank.

1017
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,199
Pure crazy.

1018
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,200
[KNOCKING]

1019
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:32,619
Boys, I reckon they got the Kid.

1020
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,089
An extra just come out.

1021
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,839
They never took the
Kid alive, never.

1022
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,529
He was born in El Paso
county and he'll die there.

1023
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,099
He said so.

1024
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,189
No, they never took him alive.

1025
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,719
Going out to the
stable for awhile.

1026
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,819
Don't want anyone with me.

1027
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,369
Poor Jad.

1028
00:51:51,370 --> 00:51:53,290
They were closer than brothers.

1029
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,939
They got the kid.

1030
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,909
Sure they get him low.

1031
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:01,439
Ain't one paper had
a good word for him.

1032
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,969
Yeah, with all that
money on his head,

1033
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,729
somebody would sure
turn him in anyway.

1034
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,069
Say, you...

1035
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:11,879
By jingo, there's a happy
show... all that money,

1036
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,409
dead or alive.

1037
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:14,410
Lucky cousin.

1038
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:21,740
Stop it.

1039
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,640
What's the matter with you?

1040
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,620
Will you...

1041
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,470
You rouse the neighbors?

1042
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,430
Are you crazy?

1043
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,230
No, I ain't.

1044
00:52:26,231 --> 00:52:27,489
He is.

1045
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:28,390
I'm just telling the truth.

1046
00:52:28,391 --> 00:52:31,589
That's all.

1047
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,809
What's that?

1048
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:36,429
Did you hear something overhead.

1049
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:38,529
A [INAUDIBLE] or something.

1050
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,080
The state's full of 'em.

1051
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,800
Kid?

1052
00:52:47,801 --> 00:52:50,409
[INAUDIBLE] Can't a man
sleep in his own house?

1053
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,110
Kid?

1054
00:52:51,111 --> 00:52:52,569
Where'd you come from?

1055
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:53,909
We thought you was
trapped in the woods.

1056
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:55,069
The newspapers said...

1057
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:55,770
You're alive.

1058
00:52:55,771 --> 00:52:57,459
How the devil did you get here?

1059
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,729
On a Pullman train, Jim.

1060
00:52:58,730 --> 00:52:59,430
Pullman?

1061
00:52:59,431 --> 00:53:01,909
Didn't no one see you
on the Pullman, Kid?

1062
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:03,249
None of it was dangerous.

1063
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,399
I just rode along natural
like everybody else.

1064
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,099
Nobody knows what a look like.

1065
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,259
Ain't no photographs
of my laying around.

1066
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:10,960
I tell you...

1067
00:53:10,961 --> 00:53:12,199
- You hungry, Kid?
- Oh, no.

1068
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,379
I ate on the train.

1069
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,679
I tell you it's a lesson to a man.

1070
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,539
A lesson what I've
been through... never

1071
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,499
get your picture took.

1072
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,819
That's right.

1073
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,780
Where's Jad?

1074
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:24,389
In the barn, I'll get him.

1075
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:26,609
Well, boys, what's the news?

1076
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,009
You're the news, Kid.

1077
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:30,679
Well, here you are, anyway.

1078
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,889
Yep, I'm home.

1079
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:33,319
There's no place like it.

1080
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,429
Boys, it's on me.

1081
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:36,239
The stagecoach job is on me.

1082
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,859
I sure come back loaded.

1083
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,639
That bank... what a haul.

1084
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,269
What a bump.

1085
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:42,639
I'm splitting with all you boys.

1086
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,909
Oh, no Kid, no.

1087
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:46,529
You're going to take it.

1088
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:50,309
Oh yeah, say what
was the row about.

1089
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,559
Sure woke me up out
of a sound sleep.

1090
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,260
Nothing, Kid.

1091
00:53:53,261 --> 00:53:54,459
Weren't nothing.

1092
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:57,829
Just over the reward for
you Kid, dead or alive.

1093
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:59,389
Charlie here thinks
that one of the boys

1094
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:00,789
would sure turn you
in for all that money.

1095
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:02,099
No, no, he didn't mean it.

1096
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:05,629
No, no I didn't mean nothing.

1097
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:07,289
Sure.

1098
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:10,089
He didn't mean nothing.

1099
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:10,790
He's young.

1100
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:13,019
He just talks.

1101
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,380
Sure He's young.

1102
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,859
What is it?

1103
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:30,780
What do you want?

1104
00:54:30,781 --> 00:54:32,689
I'm US Marshal Gregg.

1105
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:33,450
May I come in?

1106
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:34,230
Well, I...

1107
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:36,409
I want to see your husband, ma'am.

1108
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:37,849
Oh?

1109
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,729
You're Mrs. Heath, aren't you?

1110
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:40,979
Yes.

1111
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,809
My husband went out, I think.

1112
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,510
I'll see.

1113
00:54:43,511 --> 00:54:44,619
You wait here.

1114
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:46,049
Just a minute, ma'am.

1115
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,839
In case he's out, I could
tell you what I want.

1116
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:51,349
I... perhaps I'd better not.

1117
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:53,069
You can tell me.

1118
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:56,749
Well, I'm organizing
a posse, and I...

1119
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:58,559
I oughtn't to have told you.

1120
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,019
I'm sorry ma'am... mighty sorry.

1121
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,469
Ma, I changed my
mind about going out.

1122
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:07,369
Well, I didn't know
there was anyone here.

1123
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,009
This Mr. Heath?

1124
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,729
Yeah.

1125
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:15,269
I'm US Marshal Gregg from Dallas.

1126
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,649
You're the fellow I'm after.

1127
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:18,350
How's that?

1128
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:21,139
I've been making a few
inquiries around here.

1129
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,010
Yeah?

1130
00:55:22,011 --> 00:55:23,619
And finally I asked
minister nearby

1131
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,679
for the best citizens
in his congregation.

1132
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,300
Your name headed the list.

1133
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,279
Thank you, Marshall.

1134
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,039
Sorry I can't ask you
to come into the parlor.

1135
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:38,949
But it's Wednesday night.

1136
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:41,639
Mrs. Heath's sewing
circle is in there.

1137
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,370
Oh, that's all right.

1138
00:55:42,371 --> 00:55:44,609
I can't stay anyway.

1139
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,539
Mr. Heath, we're
getting up a posse

1140
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,819
to patrol the roads from
here to the state line.

1141
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,169
And I deputize you.

1142
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:50,870
What for?

1143
00:55:50,871 --> 00:55:53,900
To help round up the El
Paso Kid and his gang.

1144
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:58,829
I see.

1145
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:00,629
You've got good horses, I hear.

1146
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,279
Well, yes, I use
them in my business.

1147
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,679
I deal in grain.

1148
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,319
I travel a lot.

1149
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,699
But I read in the paper
you took the El Paso Kid.

1150
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,600
Killed him, in fact.

1151
00:56:09,601 --> 00:56:11,489
No, the varmint got away again.

1152
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,789
But we'll get him this time.

1153
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:15,199
We're going to close every
blasted road in the state.

1154
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,259
The watchword is bring
in the El Paso Kid.

1155
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:21,069
Keep it to yourself.

1156
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,799
You can depend on me.

1157
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,500
Good.

1158
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:26,129
There's just one thing
about working with you.

1159
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,509
I can't let my
business go entirely.

1160
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,470
I'm a family man.

1161
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:30,869
That's understood.

1162
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:33,489
You see, I right around
looking up future prospects.

1163
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,449
So while you close
the road to the Kid,

1164
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,419
can't you give me an
identification card

1165
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,979
so I can get through and
get my business over quick.

1166
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,229
A pass you mean?

1167
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,930
Yes.

1168
00:56:42,931 --> 00:56:44,949
Well, certainly.

1169
00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:46,559
What are your
initials, Mr. Heath?

1170
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,499
T. E.

1171
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,979
All right, this'll do it.

1172
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,149
I'll let you know
where the posse's

1173
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:54,399
meeting as soon as we organize it.

1174
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,639
Thanks, Marshal.

1175
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,759
You do that.

1176
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,549
There ain't no place I'd
feel safer than right

1177
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:00,139
in the middle of your posse.

1178
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,229
Goodnight, Mr. Heath.

1179
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:01,930
Goodnight, Marshal.

1180
00:57:01,931 --> 00:57:05,761
Goodnight, Mrs. Heath I'm sorry
I interrupted your sewing bee.

1181
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:07,870
Goodnight.

1182
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:14,609
Toby, sometimes I think you're
in league with the devil.

1183
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:17,919
Oh, Ma, I'm in
league with the law.

1184
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,249
Aw, Kid there was
the likes of you.

1185
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,189
What a song this'll make.

1186
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,699
Keep me out of your songs.

1187
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,799
All the roads is closed,
and we ain't got a pass.

1188
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,760
That's so.

1189
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:31,229
Better all start riding
before they get organized.

1190
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,409
Good luck, Kid.

1191
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:33,110
So long, Jim.

1192
00:57:33,111 --> 00:57:34,189
So long, Toby.

1193
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:35,359
Take good care of yourself.

1194
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,290
Jad.

1195
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:37,290
Bye, Kid.

1196
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,800
So long, boys.

1197
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:42,629
Good luck to you.

1198
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:43,899
Go on, Billy.

1199
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,579
Get back to the Pecos.

1200
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,759
No, Kid, you need someone.

1201
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,809
Didn't I tell you?

1202
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,370
And no fooling this time.

1203
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,939
Please, Ma.

1204
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,029
Give me another chance.

1205
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:58,699
I'll sell the business
first thing in the morning.

1206
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,479
And we'll go to California.

1207
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,869
We've never been there.

1208
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:03,499
We'll have a real church wedding.

1209
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,199
And I'll start all over again.

1210
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,830
That's what I'm afraid of...
you'll start all over again.

1211
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:18,309
I'll be up late packing, so
you better sleep in the parlor.

1212
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,980
Goodbye, Toby,

1213
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:46,779
(SINGING)El Paso Kid rode
in through town to get

1214
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:49,139
him a loan from the banker man.

1215
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,419
In his name he wrote
on a promise note,

1216
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:53,339
left with a roll in
his hand, in his hand.

1217
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:56,699
Yes, he left with
a roll in his hand.

1218
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,879
He didn't steal it.

1219
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,619
He loaned it.

1220
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:04,839
But when he heard they broke
their word, when he learned

1221
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:09,609
them bankers didn't do
right, the Kid was awful mad.

1222
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:12,019
He cracked that safe
dynamite, and he

1223
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:13,699
shut that bank up tight, up tight.

1224
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,589
Yes he closed that bank up tight.

1225
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:20,379
He walked out with some
real money that time.

1226
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:24,649
A Marshal came,
knew Heath by name,

1227
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:28,409
not knowing exactly
the work he did.

1228
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:30,999
The kid was calling
himself Heath at that time.

1229
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,809
He swore Heath into
a posse gang to chase

1230
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:37,559
himself, the Kid himself,
to chase himself the Kid.

1231
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,989
It's a Good joke on the Marshal.

1232
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:45,879
Oh he chased the
Kid, all that night,

1233
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,119
while the Marshal's
posse was in flight.

1234
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,839
And he squared up his horse
and he changed his course,

1235
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,069
and he left that
posse out of sight.

1236
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:55,569
Yes, he left them out of sight.

1237
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,399
And he squared up his horse,
and he changed his course,

1238
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,079
and he left that
posse out of sight.

1239
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,990
So he chased himself all night.

1240
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:08,119
What, again?

1241
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,659
What do I have to do to get
rid of you... plow you under?

1242
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,749
I started to leave,
Kid, but the barn

1243
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,689
was as far as I could get.

1244
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:19,629
Well, at least
you're loyal, Billy.

1245
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:21,529
Here, I'm giving you a stake.

1246
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,879
Take care of it.

1247

No, I ain't no tick bird.

1248
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,949
You take it and bury
in a clean tin can

1249
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:30,429
in an unplowed field
like we done before.

1250
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:31,719
Don't put it in no bank.

1251
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,339
I might come along.

1252
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,999
Save it for a rainy day
when I ain't around no more.

1253
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,609
No, I can't take it.

1254
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:40,179
Honest, Toby.

1255
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:41,879
I got a feeling that
as soon as I'm gone

1256

you're going to make for

1257
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,579
Well, do it.

1258
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:50,299
Kid... that fellow that
come to see you last night...

1259
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,639
that US Marshal... I
saw him in the town

1260
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,079
square a little while ago.

1261
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:54,780
Well?

1262
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:56,639
He was sitting up on a
high [INAUDIBLE] horse...

1263
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,079
a calico horse, she was... in front

1264
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:02,009
of the courthouse
a-shouting, fellow citizens!

1265
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:04,149
I never saw so many horses
in all my life... sorrels

1266
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:05,789
and blacks were filling
the road in the square

1267
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,809
and spilling over
into front yards.

1268
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:09,659
Fellas sitting on them
with ropes yelling,

1269
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:10,460
we'll get him this time.

1270
01:01:10,461 --> 01:01:13,259
We'll string him up and
leave him a-dangling.

1271
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,399
Billy, you can go
down there and bat them

1272
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:20,489

That's right.

Let him by.

1285
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:19,639
Good evening, Mr. Heath.

1286
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,759
Good evening, Marshal.

1287

Going to join us?

1288
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,159
No, just out on a little business.

1289
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:27,410
Maybe you better
join us, Mr. Heath.

1290
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,760
Put up your hands, kid.

1291
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:42,219
You sure made a fool
out of me last night.

1292
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:43,599
I sure did.

1293
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:47,539
Cinch him tight, Enis.

1294
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,959
Mind telling me
who gets the reward.

A good friend of yours.

1296
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,280
At least he says he is.

1297
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,160
He's young.

We're not all outlaws
in the state of Texas.

You'll get a fair trial.

Jackson gets off scot-free,

1310
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:53,009
and $10,000 for turning you in.

1311
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:54,469
Jad came to see me, Kid.

1312
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:55,230
Says not to worry.

1313
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,060
He's got a plan.

1314
01:03:56,061 --> 01:03:57,209
You tell Jad to stay where he is.

1315
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:59,229
He's not getting mixed
up with me no more.

1316

I'm glad it happened
this way, Billy.

It's a load off of my mind.

Toby.

1320
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:10,569
Thanks, Zee, for being
my wife all through this.

1321
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:13,029
I'm proud of you, Toby.

1322
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:16,480
And I'm going to teach your
children to be proud of you.

1323
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:21,390
Goodbye, Zee.

1324
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:28,549
When you come up to visit
me, cook me some corn pone

1325
01:04:28,550 --> 01:04:30,560
and hog meat the way you make it.

What's that?

Oh, just a hold up, I reckon.

of my breast pocket

1330

picked the wrong train.
