00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,840
THE DEATH OF THE SCORPION

2
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:08,788
Come in, boy.
I'll fix you a drink.

3
00:01:15,287 --> 00:01:17,287
Calm down,
don't be like that.

4
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:20,217
You pay me now.

5
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:21,524
Right away.

6
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:23,571
I have no money, I swear.

7
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:32,521
I have no money.

8
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,319
I swear!

9
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:37,163
Shut up, you dirty bitch.

10
00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:51,612
Cut. It's a good one.

11
00:01:52,603 --> 00:01:54,755
Now give me a
close up of the wound.

12
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
How'd it go?

13
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:57,028
<i>Perfect.</i>

14
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,169
- What do you think about it?
- It's awful.

15
00:01:59,262 --> 00:02:01,196
- It's your script.
- So what?

16
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,960
- Which one should we use?
- The fake one, of course.

17
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,909
I never liked this type of roles.

18
00:02:09,346 --> 00:02:10,386
- Don't move.

19
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:13,000
It's only that I'm fit for them
and I know how to play them.

20
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:15,755
I'd like to play the role
of a counsel, a doctor...

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,280
...a businessman...

22
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:20,200
Because the role of a homosexual...

23
00:02:20,412 --> 00:02:22,381
- I don't see myself in it.
- Please don't move...

24
00:02:22,623 --> 00:02:23,623
40 seconds.

25
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:25,533
And the second one?

26
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:27,233
<i>Ten seconds less.</i>

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,640
- Ready?
- Yeah, let's roll.

28
00:02:31,229 --> 00:02:33,362
Will the blood be visible enough?

29
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:35,849
I think it's okay.

30
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,540
- Look.
- Let me see.

31
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,719
Problems.

32
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:42,985
Problems all the time.

33
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:45,696
People would go to the
movies to have a good time.

34
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:48,782
- I don't make films for friends.
- I don't want to write them either.

35
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:51,280
But you can make new
things with a minimal risk.

36
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:53,160
Let's see this
through to the end.

37
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:54,621
- I'll talk to him.
- Hey.

38
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:56,772
- Hey, Álvaro.

39
00:02:57,574 --> 00:02:58,746
- Come here.
- What?

40
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:03,040
Nobody's eaten in 12 hours.

41
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:06,520
- I know, patience...
- I'm saying it for the boys...

42
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:09,295
- You can't cut the shooting now.
- Always the same old song...

43
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:11,092
- More and more...
- Only 15 more minutes...

44
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,366
You can't teach me anything
of the business world.

45
00:03:13,462 --> 00:03:14,520
And much less of cinema.

46
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:16,493
The audience is always king.

47
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,297
What are the alternatives?

48
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:20,844
Don't play the intellectual.

49
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:22,829
This detective series is going well.

50
00:03:22,924 --> 00:03:24,604
Think of another story.

51
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,480
Add some suspense, bed
scenes and a bit of action.

52
00:03:28,596 --> 00:03:29,596
And cheap.

53
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,268
You've done real good
things for me in the past.

54
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:37,010
- What have you done?
- What is it now?

55
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:38,302
Stop moving!

56
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:40,732
That's all I have.

57
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:42,838
I told you to bring
a big pot of it!

58
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,971
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:46,768
You're a good pro and I
want you to work with me.

60
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:49,424
But if you go on like that,
I'll know what to do.

61
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:51,559
I was just sayin'.

62
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,600
You'll have that
script, don't worry.

63
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:56,218
He's just clumsy. He dropped
it and he has no more of it.

64
00:03:56,866 --> 00:03:59,466
And I still need to
encourage this sloppy lot.

65
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:05,554
Is it true what I heard?

66
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,721
I dropped it accidentally.

67
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,880
Well, then paint it or something!
I've had enough!

68
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:11,228
Everyone back to work!
We can't waste more time!

69
00:04:11,494 --> 00:04:13,174
<i>That's no way to shoot...</i>

70
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,111
<i>He's right, everyone
back to work...</i>

71
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,432
<i>Good.</i>

72
00:04:28,588 --> 00:04:30,268
- Add your sugar yourself.
- Okay.

73
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,217
Careful with your cup.
That's it.

74
00:04:33,326 --> 00:04:34,326
<i>Caress him.</i>

75
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,012
I like it sweet.

76
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,277
<i>- Good.
- Very sweet.</i>

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,120
<i>- How many would you like?
- Two, please.</i>

78
00:04:42,024 --> 00:04:43,110
<i>Kiss him.</i>

79
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,860
<i>Perfect.</i>

80
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:47,641
<i>Awesome.</i>

81
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:49,920
What's your production
plan for next year?

82
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:53,291
Cinema is a very
effective teaching tool.

83
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,040
I mean the producer's role
is very important

84
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:59,037
and this is my great concern.

85
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,292
Now on the couch.

86
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:06,071
<i>My concern and many
other producers' too.</i>

87
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:08,962
<i>The public needs a product
they can enjoy and feel entertained with.</i>

88
00:05:09,048 --> 00:05:12,040
And which may also
contribute to raise...

89
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:14,063
- Their cultural level?
- Exactly.

90
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,249
Cultural, artistic...

91
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:19,999
We need to combine these interests
with the industry's own interests.

92
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:24,128
Carmen, you left film acting early to
devote yourself to your husband,

93
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:26,558
your son and the home
life to become Mrs. Riera.

94
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:27,988
Do you regret it?

95
00:05:28,534 --> 00:05:30,652
No. I'm completely happy.

96
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,280
Being a housewife is one of
the best parts a woman can play.

97
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
Nostalgic?

98
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:37,476
Not really.

99
00:05:37,828 --> 00:05:39,999
I feel totally fulfilled.

100
00:05:40,312 --> 00:05:42,846
So the actress has
gone away for good.

101
00:05:43,062 --> 00:05:44,735
Well, you never can tell.

102
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,187
But I'm a very happy woman now.

103
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,362
So much so, that sometimes
I think I'm dreaming.

104
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:53,160
That's all. We'll
publish it in 15 days.

105
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,660
- Ready?
- Yes.

106
00:05:54,743 --> 00:05:56,343
Why in 15 days, mum?

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,520
Why does he say so?

108
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:00,237
- Pleased to meet you.
- Bye, thank you.

109
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,200
- I'll walk you out.
- Thank you.

110
00:06:15,664 --> 00:06:18,945
- Oh...
- We need to help each other.

111
00:06:22,045 --> 00:06:24,724
- Just call me if you need anything.
- Okay.

112
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:29,936
Goodbye.

113
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:31,653
Pleased to meet you.

114
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:44,666
Ouch!

115
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:46,797
You're always complaining.

116
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,013
Be still and don't be a pain.

117
00:06:50,517 --> 00:06:51,517
Come on.

118
00:06:52,556 --> 00:06:53,836
Give dad a kiss.

119
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:07,098
Happy?

120
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:11,762
You can't complain. You've
got to admit I'm a good actress.

121
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,264
<i>I'm sorry, what did you say?</i>

122
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:15,742
Nothing...

123
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:37,529
What do we do about it?

124
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:40,727
Say something.

125
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:45,786
Come over here.

126
00:07:48,695 --> 00:07:49,695
Come over here.

127
00:08:06,425 --> 00:08:08,558
The font is a bit sophisticated.

128
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:11,742
But the text...

129
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:18,280
<i>If you don't want your husband
to know that you have a lover...</i>

130
00:08:18,928 --> 00:08:20,368
That's ridiculous.

131
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,067
<i>Leave half a million...</i>

132
00:08:24,193 --> 00:08:25,193
Not bad.

133
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,360
Does anybody know
you come around here?

134
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:36,009
Dunno... a girlfriend...

135
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:38,579
What girlfriend?

136
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,267
Leave me alone.

137
00:08:57,219 --> 00:08:58,419
Pawn something.

138
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:00,946
Are you out of your mind?

139
00:09:01,032 --> 00:09:03,165
You know he controls everything.

140
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:04,595
Don't exaggerate.

141
00:09:04,782 --> 00:09:06,462
We must find a solution.

142
00:09:07,305 --> 00:09:08,305
What?

143
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:09,693
We have to pay.

144
00:09:10,203 --> 00:09:11,563
I don't know how.

145
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:13,907
But we'll have to pay.

146
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:18,645
The problem is your son.

147
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:22,306
Carlos is mine.

148
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:24,681
Nobody can take
him away from me.

149
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,999
First, we must know...

150
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:33,672
What will Andrés
do if he finds out?

151
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:35,638
Maybe he won't mind.

152
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,848
Since we have a meeting at
your house tomorrow evening...

153
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:46,468
I'll just ask him.

154
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:52,723
It's late.

155
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:17,932
Come, I want you on top.

156
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:38,649
The plot begins with
the usual triangle.

157
00:10:38,907 --> 00:10:41,480
And an exorbitant
blackmail that they can't pay.

158
00:10:41,712 --> 00:10:42,907
Sounds good to me.

159
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:45,029
Why wouldn't she get a divorce?

160
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:47,760
Because of her husband's money?

161
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:49,935
Nobody will believe that.

162
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,962
- It has to be something more private.
- Their children.

163
00:10:55,638 --> 00:10:58,160
Most married couples
will go on for their children.

164
00:10:58,363 --> 00:10:59,363
No.

165
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:01,049
What for, then?
Love?

166
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:04,009
Yes, even if you
may think otherwise.

167
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:05,746
I'm sick of this gadget!

168
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:08,520
In how many movies
have you used it already?

169
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:10,326
This is its fifth one.

170
00:11:10,498 --> 00:11:13,231
I hope we'll ditch it
for our next movie.

171
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:15,498
Let's be serious now.

172
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,008
Women are afraid
of living alone.

173
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,792
They get married because
they know no better.

174
00:11:21,003 --> 00:11:22,736
You must speak from experience.

175
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,815
They bind themselves
for their children.

176
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,995
It's my turn now.

177
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,120
Any woman will lose them
if she dares to separate.

178
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:30,129
They always stay with the father.

179
00:11:31,403 --> 00:11:32,403
Isabel...

180
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,758
You don't have a clue
about how men think.

181
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:38,735
If you and I should be married,

182
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:40,932
and you'd want to separate,

183
00:11:41,523 --> 00:11:42,703
you can take the children.

184
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:44,788
You obviously don't
have any children.

185
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,377
What would you do?

186
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,920
Just suppose you find out
Carmen is cheating on you.

187
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:49,933
Bullshit!

188
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,308
That's the attitude the
husband must have in the movie.

189
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:54,360
That's the story's
initial dramatic spine.

190
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:56,253
I'm tired.

191
00:11:56,691 --> 00:11:59,240
Okay.
We need some action.

192
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:01,621
Drugs, trafficking in women...

193
00:12:01,813 --> 00:12:03,813
Okay, let's leave it as it is.

194
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:12,253
All men are the same.

195
00:12:12,691 --> 00:12:14,491
They think of nothing else.

196
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,080
Sex, always sex.

197
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:28,092
Please calm down, madam.

198
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:30,155
Of course...

199
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:31,351
At his age...

200
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:34,606
His secretary is
always flirting.

201
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:36,303
I suspected it.

202
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:39,437
When you get old,
they just dump you.

203
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,599
Do you want to file
for a separation?

204
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:42,818
No...

205
00:12:43,912 --> 00:12:46,520
With the report we've got, we'd
be able to claim maintenance.

206
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:47,607
No...

207
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:51,777
So what do you want me to do?

208
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:54,001
I don't know.

209
00:13:12,222 --> 00:13:15,320
. No need to worry, madam.
- Okay, thank you very much.

210
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,760
- Have a nice day.
- Bye.

211
00:13:25,428 --> 00:13:26,868
- Hi, Carmen.
- Hi.

212
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,822
I came to visit a friend.
She lives upstairs. On the 4th floor.

213
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:31,096
It's two floors up.

214
00:13:31,166 --> 00:13:32,986
Do you want to come
in and chat for a while?

215
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,960
No, I can't. I'm in a
hurry. Some other day.

216
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:37,264
That's too bad.

217
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,334
The girlfriend
trick is too old.

218
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:17,508
You have problems, haven't you?
What is it?

219
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:19,777
Nothing, nothing.

220
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:23,440
- You have a lover.
- What?

221
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:26,062
Someone knows and
is blackmailing you.

222
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:30,449
Come on, I'm a counsel.
Try to trust me a little.

223
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:33,342
I don't know what
you're talking about.

224
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:35,222
It was clear that
you'd be in trouble.

225
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:37,043
You'd better admit it.

226
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:40,104
You got married to escalate.

227
00:14:40,238 --> 00:14:42,600
You didn't give it much thought
and found yourself pregnant.

228
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:43,956
How do you know?

229
00:14:44,532 --> 00:14:45,572
I follow you.

230
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,399
I get bored,

231
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,988
and I'd read the rags.

232
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:53,152
I like to read gossip
about famous people.

233
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:57,269
Do you think I still have
hard feelings about it?

234
00:14:58,066 --> 00:15:00,917
It was ten years ago.
I'm not that mean.

235
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,590
I can be of help.

236
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,855
Will you take the elevator?

237
00:15:06,191 --> 00:15:08,043
Or you'd rather
walk down the stairs?

238
00:15:18,194 --> 00:15:19,794
We've got two hours.

239
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:22,881
You're a bit late, aren't you?

240
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:26,835
This is all I could get.

241
00:15:28,478 --> 00:15:29,918
I'd never wear it.

242
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:32,275
Do you think
Andrés will find out?

243
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,970
If you pay, it becomes a loop.

244
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:38,470
- What will you do next month?
- It won't happen again.

245
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Why?

246
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:43,704
He's asking too much.
He can't be a pro.

247
00:15:43,807 --> 00:15:45,247
Who told you that?

248
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:48,854
Luis.

249
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,573
I see.

250
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:05,224
What are you doing?

251
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:08,954
Someone needs to
pick up a package.

252
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:12,298
Not very original, but
I can't think of anything else.

253
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,415
Please, don't.

254
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:16,179
Why would you come here anyway?

255
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:19,613
I dunno.

256
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,106
Someone will pick
up this package.

257
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,353
Does Luis know you're here?

258
00:16:32,537 --> 00:16:33,537
No.

259
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:36,388
Are you in love?

260
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,040
You don't ask these
things this way.

261
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,052
You are.
Let's go.

262
00:18:34,438 --> 00:18:35,438
Come...

263
00:18:40,314 --> 00:18:42,048
Can I already give you...?

264
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,305
Of course.
Go get it.

265
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:52,160
For my mum.

266
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:54,680
For Mother's Day.

267
00:18:54,786 --> 00:18:55,786
What is it?

268
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:59,633
A man is kicking the ball.

269
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:02,680
The grass.
People who are watching.

270
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:04,467
- And the sky.
- Very well.

271
00:19:06,898 --> 00:19:08,178
Hey, Carlitos...

272
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,950
Go get the box.

273
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:29,741
What is this?

274
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:31,006
Help her out.

275
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:45,977
How nice!

276
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,050
Thank you.

277
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:58,159
<i>- One moment.
- I love it. It's so beautiful.</i>

278
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,839
It's for you, madam.
The seamstress.

279
00:20:00,956 --> 00:20:01,956
Excuse me.

280
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:05,968
Quite a coat, eh?
Come...

281
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:08,975
Hello?

282
00:20:09,397 --> 00:20:10,283
Hello?

283
00:20:10,403 --> 00:20:12,030
And now you'll tell me
everything you have drawn.

284
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,103
<i>Hi.</i>

285
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,007
<i>That was foul play, my dear.</i>

286
00:20:18,405 --> 00:20:21,349
<i>- Who is it?
- You'll receive another postcard.</i>

287
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:24,360
And these are the stars.

288
00:20:25,193 --> 00:20:28,630
<i>No tricks this time.</i>

289
00:20:29,075 --> 00:20:30,755
<i>And no counsellors either.</i>

290
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,459
Okay. I'll drop
by this afternoon.

291
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:41,473
Come on now.

292
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,931
Straight to the clouds!

293
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,576
Go get it.
Run!

294
00:20:57,594 --> 00:20:58,794
Where's Carmen?

295
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:00,457
In her room.

296
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:03,199
- She's not feeling well lately.
- What's wrong?

297
00:21:03,261 --> 00:21:04,301
I don't know.

298
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:07,000
It must be the weather.
It affects her a lot.

299
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,200
There you go!

300
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:23,232
<i>You'd better take a break.</i>

301
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:29,751
- Want some? - No
- Oh, just for today.

302
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:32,283
Drinking doesn't agree with me.

303
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:48,562
Have you thought
about the actors?

304
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:50,960
Not yet.
I've got her only.

305
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:54,072
Your wife could do it.

306
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,885
No, the main character
must be a stunning woman.

307
00:21:57,946 --> 00:21:59,399
A second-rate Italian.

308
00:21:59,517 --> 00:22:02,440
Co-productions want it that way.

309
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:04,556
She'd love to make a comeback.

310
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:06,053
That's impossible.

311
00:22:06,668 --> 00:22:08,762
So, what was the plot?

312
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:13,520
She hires a private eye.
- No, no... That's too clichéd.

313
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,354
Private eyes are very
colourless roles anyway.

314
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:19,532
She'd better hire...

315
00:22:21,157 --> 00:22:22,837
a counsellor instead.

316
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:24,308
An old friend.

317
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:26,680
She trusts him.

318
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:29,887
What's the difference?
It's the same thing.

319
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:32,243
She goes to see him on her own.

320
00:22:32,336 --> 00:22:33,960
She doesn't tell
her guy about it.

321
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:36,918
He gets pissed off and
breaks up with her. But why?

322
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:39,824
She has money, or at
least she can get it for sure.

323
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:44,557
She'd better pay if
she wants to have fun.

324
00:22:45,445 --> 00:22:46,965
It's crystal clear.

325
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:53,200
- How are you feeling?
- I'm better, thank you.

326
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:55,454
You have a call from Rome.

327
00:22:57,424 --> 00:22:58,704
- Hi, Luis.
- Hi.

328
00:23:00,987 --> 00:23:02,667
Are you still angry?

329
00:23:06,693 --> 00:23:07,693
Be careful.

330
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:09,404
I don't care.

331
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:34,394
Please try to understand.

332
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:36,400
Fernando takes
care of these things.

333
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:39,599
- I thought he could help us.
- Yeah, I saw that.

334
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:43,120
- I'm sorry.
- Listen...

335
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:46,307
I don't want more
troubles, understand?

336
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,319
I need you.

337
00:23:51,452 --> 00:23:53,616
Go find that friend of
yours if you feel alone.

338
00:23:53,678 --> 00:23:56,520
- He's more experienced.
- Luis, won't you play with me?

339
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:58,869
- There's the ball.
- We'll use this one instead.

340
00:23:59,298 --> 00:24:00,578
Come on, hit it.

341
00:24:20,766 --> 00:24:22,773
You've had such a
straight face all evening.

342
00:24:22,914 --> 00:24:24,759
I needed to make
a good impression.

343
00:24:24,984 --> 00:24:27,518
You amused them
for both of us anyway.

344
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,151
- Are you all right?
- Yes, but I'm tired.

345
00:24:38,222 --> 00:24:39,902
You'd better sit down.

346
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:51,680
That soprano and the
orchestra were great.

347
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,440
But Wagner bores me.

348
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,840
He makes me thirsty.

349
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,360
Wait... have a drink.

350
00:25:02,485 --> 00:25:03,665
- The last one.
- No.

351
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:34,561
<i>Open up!</i>

352
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:39,751
What do you want?

353
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,079
<i>Open up!</i>

354
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,200
I'm really exhausted.

355
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,156
I have a headache.

356
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,319
<i>Just open up!</i>

357
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,032
Goodnight.

358
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,059
Luis!

359
00:27:16,758 --> 00:27:18,558
What is it?
Feeling nervous?

360
00:27:27,065 --> 00:27:28,065
Listen...

361
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:32,720
But I feel very happy.
So much so, that sometimes...

362
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,560
I feel like I'm dreaming.

363
00:27:47,964 --> 00:27:50,231
<i>- Mummy?
- What are you doing here?</i>

364
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:58,937
- Where's daddy?
- He's out on a trip.

365
00:27:59,023 --> 00:28:01,351
Don't look at me that way.
He won't bring you anything.

366
00:28:01,437 --> 00:28:02,880
Yes, he will.

367
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:05,560
Can I sleep with you?

368
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,581
You're too old for that.

369
00:28:08,307 --> 00:28:09,907
Come on, stay still.

370
00:28:19,728 --> 00:28:21,408
Come on kid, stay still.

371
00:28:22,705 --> 00:28:23,985
Let's go to bed.

372
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:35,654
- No time for comics.
- Please. - No.

373
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:39,000
- It's time to sleep.
- Please...

374
00:28:39,138 --> 00:28:41,605
- I want to read it.
- Give me a kiss.

375
00:29:58,516 --> 00:29:59,516
Carmen.

376
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:02,012
What are you doing?

377
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,681
You're freezing.

378
00:30:12,972 --> 00:30:13,972
Come.

379
00:30:58,671 --> 00:31:01,840
- I'd like to spend the night here.
- That won't be possible.

380
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:06,195
Just imagine when the maid
gets into your room with your breakfast...

381
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,960
<i>Where is she?
Miss!</i>

382
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:09,331
Miss!

383
00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:10,479
Miss!

384
00:31:11,268 --> 00:31:12,268
Miss?

385
00:31:26,443 --> 00:31:27,643
Do you like me?

386
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,013
- I've got some wrinkles...
- Get out...

387
00:31:30,977 --> 00:31:32,417
What's this about?

388
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:39,938
Who's there?

389
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,430
Stay here.

390
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:45,691
Who was that?

391
00:32:46,229 --> 00:32:47,909
Nothing.
Just a joke.

392
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:50,520
- Who was that?
- Nothing...

393
00:32:50,753 --> 00:32:52,456
It's normal in this
neighbourhood.

394
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:54,480
We can't see each other again...

395
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:55,659
...here.

396
00:32:58,013 --> 00:32:59,693
We must be more cautious.

397
00:33:02,904 --> 00:33:04,584
Don't you ever leave me!

398
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,618
- Hi.
- Hi.

399
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,592
First off, none of them
has any previous record.

400
00:33:24,438 --> 00:33:26,800
This is the cottage's service.
The cooker is a widow.

401
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:30,080
She'd only leave on Sundays to go
to mass and visit her married cousin.

402
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,734
She spends the
whole afternoon there.

403
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:33,531
She gets back by
nine with the bus.

404
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,679
The most interesting thing about her
must be the line she travels with.

405
00:33:36,859 --> 00:33:37,859
Oh well...

406
00:33:38,156 --> 00:33:41,351
The maid and the gardener
are irrelevant to the case.

407
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,440
This must have come out
of the production company.

408
00:33:43,552 --> 00:33:45,693
Carmen has been displaced
ever since she got married.

409
00:33:45,763 --> 00:33:47,763
She's lost all of her friends.

410
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:50,360
All the people she knows
now come from Andrés's side.

411
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,760
Álvaro Sánchez.

412
00:33:52,013 --> 00:33:55,565
He works as a production
chief and is Andrés's henchman.

413
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,720
He'd only go from home to work.

414
00:33:57,823 --> 00:33:59,878
He's married, with five children.

415
00:34:00,003 --> 00:34:02,080
The concierge says
he's in financial trouble.

416
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,280
He can't pay the instalments
of a fridge he bought.

417
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:07,280
He owes three months' rent
but he keeps on buying things.

418
00:34:08,585 --> 00:34:09,585
Juan Dalmau.

419
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:12,053
He's also married.
No children.

420
00:34:12,678 --> 00:34:14,412
He's always hanging around.

421
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:17,038
He boasts about being a film director.

422
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:20,158
And he'd always use
credit cards to pay.

423
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:22,728
Luis Serra.

424
00:34:22,822 --> 00:34:24,431
Single.
He lives on his own.

425
00:34:24,509 --> 00:34:27,240
He lives an orderly life,
writing scripts at home.

426
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:30,353
He'd barely go out.
No known debts.

427
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:33,447
Everything Carmen told you about is true.
He's an orphan.

428
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:37,052
He's been working with Andrés since
he was 15. He started out as a gofer.

429
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:40,617
I wish I'd make the good
money he makes now.

430
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:42,998
Let me see.

431
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:45,816
Isabel Borras.

432
00:34:46,508 --> 00:34:50,028
She lives with her parents.
She'd go out to party often,

433
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:53,172
and she'd stay the night at her friends'
houses sometimes, but nothing else.

434
00:34:53,337 --> 00:34:55,544
She likes to have fun.
She works on a whim.

435
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,520
She's some sort of secretary. Both for
the production company and on shootings.

436
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:01,817
She comes from a wealthy family.

437
00:35:01,911 --> 00:35:03,880
She spends the night
with Luis once a week.

438
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,079
Regularly.

439
00:35:05,431 --> 00:35:06,431
That's all.

440
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:08,243
I see.

441
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:14,251
When do you have to pay?

442
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,840
In a few days.

443
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:18,031
Does Carmen know
another postcard arrived?

444
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,397
No, she doesn't.

445
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:21,461
You're in for a world of hurt.

446
00:35:22,398 --> 00:35:23,518
Why would you?

447
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:26,070
Don't worry.
I can handle it.

448
00:37:23,122 --> 00:37:26,642
I'm sorry, I thought you
had left. I'll come back later.

449
00:37:32,992 --> 00:37:33,992
Hey, you!

450
00:37:34,054 --> 00:37:35,734
Keep the wheel aside.

451
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:42,826
What are they doing?

452
00:37:44,604 --> 00:37:46,213
They're cleaning up the beach.

453
00:37:46,315 --> 00:37:48,381
Can't it be done automatically?

454
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,924
Labour is cheaper.

455
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:05,858
You know...

456
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:09,687
The blackmailer may be one of
the models who go out with Juan.

457
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:12,748
Or Isabel.

458
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:14,404
Or Álvaro.

459
00:38:16,389 --> 00:38:17,749
Or Álvaro's wife.

460
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:22,666
<i>- It could be anyone.
- You're only taking half of it...</i>

461
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:24,275
Even Luis.

462
00:38:24,494 --> 00:38:25,525
<i>Come on...</i>

463
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,860
Are you jealous?

464
00:38:32,365 --> 00:38:34,170
Andrés would just
push people around.

465
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:36,597
- Who can put up with it?
- You can.

466
00:38:39,013 --> 00:38:40,053
Wait no more.

467
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,748
Get ahead of yourself.

468
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,960
Strike first.

469
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,132
Sue him for divorce.

470
00:38:47,297 --> 00:38:48,977
- It's not so easy.
- Why?

471
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:54,069
You don't know him.
He'd try to kill me.

472
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,680
I'm serious.

473
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:02,301
<i>Okay...</i>

474
00:39:03,379 --> 00:39:05,120
<i>What about the kid in the park?</i>

475
00:39:05,629 --> 00:39:06,629
<i>Nothing.</i>

476
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,640
<i>He fetched the package
for a box of candy.</i>

477
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,210
<i>Sugar?</i>

478
00:39:12,374 --> 00:39:13,734
<i>Yes.
Two, please.</i>

479
00:39:13,992 --> 00:39:15,858
<i>It can't be a single person.</i>

480
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:28,315
I'm looking for a girl with
an old woman's voice...

481
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:31,737
...who may act in collusion with
someone from the production company.

482
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:35,149
We've got some
contradictory information here.

483
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,880
What are you thinking of?

484
00:39:45,787 --> 00:39:48,687
Are you aware that Luis
may also be implied?

485
00:39:48,835 --> 00:39:50,035
Don't be silly.

486
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:52,751
He has no reason to.
He just left me.

487
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:56,283
I found out...

488
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:00,563
...that your guy
sleeps with Isabel.

489
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:09,476
I was thinking that tonight I'll
make things clear, no matter what.

490
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Or almost.

491
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,943
No!
You can't be serious!

492
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:25,680
What about the kid?
He needs a family, he needs his father!

493
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:27,474
Please don't yell at me.

494
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:39,360
You'll see us anytime you want.
The three of us.

495
00:40:39,446 --> 00:40:41,555
There are countless
ways to settle this.

496
00:40:44,472 --> 00:40:46,370
I know I'm hurting you,
and I'm sorry for that.

497
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:48,287
- Because I love you.
- Duh!

498
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:50,441
Yes, I do.

499
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:53,791
But we're so different
from each other.

500
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:56,464
I feel oppressed in this house.

501
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:58,631
You've got to understand.

502
00:40:59,272 --> 00:41:01,138
I'm so disappointed, Carmen.

503
00:41:03,084 --> 00:41:05,045
There must be something else to it.

504
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,787
Something I don't
even want to consider!

505
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:09,320
Don't waste your time on that.

506
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:12,000
I simply don't feel
happy anymore.

507
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,916
I'm depressed.

508
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,971
You have anything you want.

509
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,840
If you're depressed,
you can see a psychiatrist.

510
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,480
I'm not sick!

511
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:23,846
I simply want to be myself.
I want to be something!

512
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:27,560
Can't you even see that?

513
00:41:28,682 --> 00:41:31,360
I don't know what
else to tell you.

514
00:41:32,393 --> 00:41:33,846
Please think it over.

515
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,596
We must think it over.

516
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,372
At least for a while.

517
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:48,992
Leave me alone.

518
00:41:50,565 --> 00:41:51,765
As you like it.

519
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:02,154
I work too much.

520
00:42:03,303 --> 00:42:04,983
Carmen is always at home.

521
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:07,724
Carlos is not a toddler anymore.

522
00:42:07,842 --> 00:42:09,108
Its only logical.

523
00:42:09,264 --> 00:42:12,733
When women get bored,
they start thinking too much.

524
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:16,233
We could call her
to a casting session.

525
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:19,400
- Carmen?
- Yes, but an easy one.

526
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,800
Sounds great.

527
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,403
I think she needs a distraction.

528
00:42:23,551 --> 00:42:26,450
She's the true main character,
and can do a great job.

529
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:31,259
She goes from one lover to another,
always threatened by blackmailers.

530
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:33,184
Won't it be too monotonous?

531
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,720
No.

532
00:42:34,923 --> 00:42:37,840
She tries to divorce her
husband before he finds out.

533
00:42:38,142 --> 00:42:39,783
And what does her husband do?

534
00:42:39,931 --> 00:42:41,611
I'm not quite sure yet.

535
00:42:42,481 --> 00:42:43,761
He's suspicious.

536
00:42:44,012 --> 00:42:45,692
He may react violently.

537
00:42:46,603 --> 00:42:48,791
But he has no
evidence against her.

538
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:51,330
And he needs to believe that
his wife has told him the truth.

539
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,377
And they don't get
a divorce in the end.

540
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,520
That's impossible.

541
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:58,326
The audience
would feel ripped off.

542
00:42:58,672 --> 00:43:00,872
People love
melodramatic endings.

543
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:02,719
Well...

544
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,532
...that's what you always say.

545
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,720
Okay, then start writing that script and
we'll call her for the casting session.

546
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:11,569
Alright.
See you later.

547
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

548
00:43:48,383 --> 00:43:49,583
Scotch, please.

549
00:43:49,774 --> 00:43:51,782
Who's that guy who just came in.
Do you know him?

550
00:43:51,868 --> 00:43:53,920
- He's looking at you.
- I never saw him before.

551
00:43:54,774 --> 00:43:56,640
But I don't like him at all.

552
00:43:56,732 --> 00:43:58,798
- Where is she?
- In the toilet.

553
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,028
- It was the same dress.
- Yes, but the skirt was longer.

554
00:44:06,707 --> 00:44:09,574
- I heard of a new place.
- Let's go see it.

555
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,480
No.
It's not her.

556
00:44:11,855 --> 00:44:12,855
I'm sorry.

557
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:15,754
- Hi there. Do you come here often?
- Have you finished?

558
00:44:15,824 --> 00:44:16,949
Are you having fun?

559
00:44:26,453 --> 00:44:27,453
Come in.

560
00:44:35,065 --> 00:44:36,065
Hi.

561
00:44:36,432 --> 00:44:37,432
Hi.

562
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:47,301
You look lovely.

563
00:44:47,779 --> 00:44:50,245
You're tailor-made
for the character.

564
00:44:53,419 --> 00:44:54,419
Nervous?

565
00:44:54,646 --> 00:44:56,583
- Yes.
- It's just a test.

566
00:44:57,552 --> 00:44:59,286
Yeah, but after so long...

567
00:45:00,302 --> 00:45:01,982
This is what you do best.

568
00:45:02,873 --> 00:45:04,233
I know very well.

569
00:45:07,677 --> 00:45:08,677
Here.

570
00:45:10,555 --> 00:45:12,488
- All of it?
- Up to the sign.

571
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:22,409
How are you doing?

572
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:27,003
- I feel very alone.
- Stop it.

573
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:28,897
- What about Isabel?
- Oh...

574
00:45:29,831 --> 00:45:33,031
Does your counsellor know
what my tobacco brand is too?

575
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:35,920
So I'm a suspect too.

576
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:39,981
- So you keep receiving postcards.
- No, I don't.

577
00:45:40,385 --> 00:45:41,600
<i>Hi, Luis.</i>

578
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:44,050
- Are you ready?
- Just a second.

579
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:51,615
Friends?

580
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:54,576
Friends.

581
00:45:56,646 --> 00:45:58,779
<i>Do I push the travelling forward?
- Yes.</i>

582
00:46:00,118 --> 00:46:01,398
<i>Okay.
- Let's go.</i>

583
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:04,259
Come on, leave
your nerves behind.

584
00:46:08,243 --> 00:46:11,143
It's no big deal.
It'll be very easy for you.

585
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:12,542
<i>We can start.
- There</i>

586
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:14,121
Just stand there.

587
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:15,316
- Hi.
- Hi.

588
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:18,777
- Do I look good?
- Prettier than ever.

589
00:46:18,862 --> 00:46:21,464
- Do you like my dress?
- You could back-comb your hair a bit...

590
00:46:21,974 --> 00:46:23,325
<i>Mind the spotlight.</i>

591
00:46:23,482 --> 00:46:24,842
What do you want?

592
00:46:26,763 --> 00:46:28,443
Will I see you tonight?

593
00:46:29,169 --> 00:46:32,497
I've got a lot of work to do.
I think I'll stay home.

594
00:46:32,786 --> 00:46:34,920
Are you in some kind of trouble?

595
00:46:35,286 --> 00:46:37,466
Why?
No...

596
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:39,665
We'll have dinner
together tomorrow.

597
00:46:39,892 --> 00:46:42,792
<i>- Tonight I need to write.
- We're ready too.</i>

598
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,673
Well, what is it?

599
00:46:47,868 --> 00:46:48,908
I'm not sure.

600
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,816
A strange guy was asking around.

601
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:56,053
He told me he was a
friend of yours and he's not.

602
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:58,226
He wouldn't tell me his name.

603
00:46:58,964 --> 00:46:59,964
How was he?

604
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:02,510
<i>In his forties,
quite handsome.</i>

605
00:47:02,748 --> 00:47:05,015
<i>Some Grey hair.
An interesting man.</i>

606
00:47:05,498 --> 00:47:06,772
<i>What did he want?</i>

607
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:09,373
<i>He wanted to know who was
hiring the voices for the dubbings.</i>

608
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:13,694
I didn't understand. He asked
about everybody. Juan, Álvaro, you...

609
00:47:13,811 --> 00:47:15,545
Why are you worried about it?

610
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:17,808
I think it's just an
old-fashioned flirting method.

611
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:19,296
I don't think so.

612
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:23,626
- Ready when you are.
- I'll be right there.

613
00:47:25,603 --> 00:47:28,228
If he's a friend, he'll say
something eventually.

614
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:30,915
- See you tomorrow?
- You bet.

615
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,320
- Hey you.
- Hi.

616
00:47:37,087 --> 00:47:38,728
Tell her what you want from her.

617
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,728
I don't know why
she's so nervous.

618
00:47:40,868 --> 00:47:41,962
I'm off.

619
00:47:42,845 --> 00:47:44,071
Have you learnt it?

620
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:48,168
Couldn't we just put something
here like a table or a chair...?

621
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,978
Something I can lean on.

622
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,165
No, no... A good actress
wouldn't need any of this.

623
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,840
Just imagine the stage.

624
00:47:54,012 --> 00:47:55,637
It'll be easier when we shoot.

625
00:47:56,645 --> 00:48:00,760
Imagine you're in a room.
In a house or in a hotel.

626
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:02,575
It doesn't matter.

627
00:48:02,864 --> 00:48:04,864
You're a self-confident woman,

628
00:48:04,957 --> 00:48:07,640
who's in a
relationship with a bore.

629
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:09,428
A really big bore.

630
00:48:09,613 --> 00:48:12,379
You're with him but deep
inside you despise him.

631
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:14,626
Someone like that sinister one.

632
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,680
- Who?
- Who else?

633
00:48:18,784 --> 00:48:20,870
Don't stop even if you
make a mistake, okay?

634
00:48:20,971 --> 00:48:21,971
Okay.

635
00:48:24,257 --> 00:48:25,257
Camera.

636
00:48:26,343 --> 00:48:27,463
We're rolling.

637
00:48:28,202 --> 00:48:29,351
Go ahead, Carmen.

638
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:42,565
Where have you been?

639
00:48:47,143 --> 00:48:48,583
We can't go on like this.

640
00:48:49,279 --> 00:48:53,701
I don't want to keep seeing you every
afternoon from 5 to 7 in this lousy room.

641
00:48:54,037 --> 00:48:55,770
I'm a rich woman, my dear.

642
00:48:56,053 --> 00:48:58,119
And I can still be much richer.

643
00:49:01,852 --> 00:49:03,212
It's very simple.

644
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:06,509
My husband has to vanish.

645
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:08,204
You've got to be joking.

646
00:49:08,422 --> 00:49:10,889
You could be a
good father to my son.

647
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:12,201
Are you afraid?

648
00:49:14,776 --> 00:49:17,206
Would you rather be dragging
around like this for life?

649
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:18,548
You're a loser.

650
00:49:19,034 --> 00:49:20,862
This is all you
have to offer me.

651
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,050
This is all.

652
00:49:33,498 --> 00:49:35,178
I was playing a role.

653
00:49:40,407 --> 00:49:42,740
I was lying.
Please forgive me.

654
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,493
What's this all about?

655
00:49:44,883 --> 00:49:46,719
I was in a casting
for a film today.

656
00:49:46,797 --> 00:49:47,797
Which film?

657
00:49:49,626 --> 00:49:52,418
I wanted to surprise you.
It's a very nice role.

658
00:49:52,668 --> 00:49:54,268
- Andrés...
- Andrés?

659
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,050
I see.

660
00:49:57,511 --> 00:50:00,122
You just told him you want a
divorce and now you accept.

661
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:01,762
You don't see.

662
00:50:02,692 --> 00:50:03,812
Why?

663
00:50:05,098 --> 00:50:07,165
Why does he believe in you now?

664
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:10,726
You're a frustrated person.

665
00:50:10,976 --> 00:50:13,867
They offer you a shit film and
you accept it with pleasure.

666
00:50:14,023 --> 00:50:16,756
- Don't be vulgar.
- I am vulgar, so what?

667
00:50:19,758 --> 00:50:20,758
Fernando...

668
00:50:22,008 --> 00:50:23,720
- Leave me alone.
- Come here.

669
00:50:24,461 --> 00:50:25,901
- What for?
- Come.

670
00:50:26,672 --> 00:50:27,672
<i>Come...</i>

671
00:50:28,906 --> 00:50:31,464
<i>- I love you.
- I love you too, very much.</i>

672
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:34,628
<i>- Very much.
- Fernando...</i>

673
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:36,198
<i>Very much.</i>

674
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,900
- Please don't.
- I'll handle this.

675
00:50:51,427 --> 00:50:52,825
Hello?
Hello?

676
00:50:54,231 --> 00:50:56,800
<i>- Hello?
- It's the second time you fail to pay.</i>

677
00:50:57,661 --> 00:51:00,028
<i>- Your husband will
know all about it today.</i>

678
00:51:00,145 --> 00:51:02,000
<i>Your honeymoon is over.</i>

679
00:51:02,675 --> 00:51:04,560
<i>Goodbye forever.</i>

680
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:09,402
Her again?

681
00:51:10,576 --> 00:51:11,576
Enough.

682
00:51:12,443 --> 00:51:13,959
- It's over.
- What?

683
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:25,600
The voice is fake.
It's a recording.

684
00:51:26,604 --> 00:51:27,737
I'm positive.

685
00:51:29,011 --> 00:51:30,691
Why didn't you tell me?

686
00:51:31,662 --> 00:51:34,295
What could you do about it?
Nothing.

687
00:51:36,373 --> 00:51:38,772
She had us both under her
fingers, and she has been quicker.

688
00:51:39,592 --> 00:51:41,592
Your husband knows everything.

689
00:51:43,202 --> 00:51:44,722
I can't believe it.

690
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:49,406
You'll have to
make decisions now.

691
00:51:49,702 --> 00:51:50,982
I'm out of here.

692
00:51:53,452 --> 00:51:55,132
See how useful my job is.

693
00:51:56,616 --> 00:51:58,772
Come with me, with Carlos.

694
00:52:00,276 --> 00:52:02,424
Yes.
I say we both run away.

695
00:52:03,557 --> 00:52:05,237
We fly to Mexico tonight.

696
00:52:05,448 --> 00:52:06,917
My brother lives there.

697
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:09,628
He works in the insurance
business. He'll help us.

698
00:52:11,334 --> 00:52:13,201
It's not a very brilliant
proposal, I know.

699
00:52:13,474 --> 00:52:14,967
But that's all I've got.

700
00:52:15,287 --> 00:52:16,407
<i>Take a chance.</i>

701
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,540
<i>You'll never be happy here.
Are you coming?</i>

702
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:20,623
Too over the top.

703
00:53:22,646 --> 00:53:23,739
What do you think?

704
00:53:23,849 --> 00:53:26,449
- Let's hear it all, with music.
- Okay.

705
00:53:45,175 --> 00:53:47,362
Come over.
I'll fix you a drink.

706
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:48,581
<i>Come closer.</i>

707
00:53:55,136 --> 00:53:56,336
Calm down, boy.

708
00:54:00,013 --> 00:54:01,800
You pay me now.

709
00:54:01,974 --> 00:54:02,974
Right away!

710
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:05,107
I have no money here, I swear!

711
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:14,140
What are you trying to do?

712
00:54:14,844 --> 00:54:15,844
No! No!

713
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:18,993
This is for you,
you dirty bitch!

714
00:54:28,245 --> 00:54:29,597
Lights on.

715
00:54:31,691 --> 00:54:33,320
It's no good.

716
00:54:33,808 --> 00:54:34,808
Why?

717
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:37,097
It's a good one.

718
00:54:45,052 --> 00:54:46,052
Next one.

719
00:54:54,867 --> 00:54:56,086
It's okay.

720
00:55:19,201 --> 00:55:20,881
Get it finished by 12h.

721
00:55:20,912 --> 00:55:23,712
- That's impossible.
- Not a minute longer.

722
00:55:23,998 --> 00:55:25,438
<i>What do we do now?</i>

723
00:55:27,196 --> 00:55:28,196
Go ahead.

724
00:55:36,305 --> 00:55:37,305
Where is he?

725
00:55:37,368 --> 00:55:39,305
- In the editing room.
- Wait for me outside.

726
00:55:39,407 --> 00:55:41,087
I need to talk to you.

727
00:55:54,273 --> 00:55:55,273
Andrés.

728
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:08,539
Trust me.

729
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,507
You must do something about it.

730
00:56:23,299 --> 00:56:24,979
Wake up!
Carmen loves you.

731
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:30,557
- I'm a fool.
- Don't let her go.

732
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,420
You need to protect her.

733
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:36,107
What can I do?

734
00:56:39,419 --> 00:56:40,419
Listen...

735
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:44,570
Carmen and you have been having
problems for some time now, right?

736
00:56:45,008 --> 00:56:46,128
Use your head.

737
00:56:47,008 --> 00:56:49,341
She can't be in
love with that guy.

738
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Sure...

739
00:56:54,692 --> 00:56:56,372
As in your damned script.

740
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,856
- You knew!
- Let go of me!

741
00:56:59,364 --> 00:57:01,231
What a foolish thing to say.

742
00:57:03,334 --> 00:57:07,622
She'll forget all about it as soon
as she starts shooting the film.

743
00:57:08,701 --> 00:57:10,141
I'm sure about it.

744
00:57:10,646 --> 00:57:13,310
She doesn't deserve a thing!

745
00:57:13,724 --> 00:57:15,924
Do you want her
to stay with you?

746
00:57:18,196 --> 00:57:21,836
You must go home now.
She may still be there.

747
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,703
Let her be in her room tonight.

748
00:57:27,494 --> 00:57:28,494
You need to.

749
00:57:30,228 --> 00:57:31,960
You're her husband, aren't you?

750
00:57:32,486 --> 00:57:34,166
I'll take care of him.

751
00:57:35,353 --> 00:57:36,873
Here's his address.

752
00:57:37,486 --> 00:57:38,686
I'll go to see him.

753
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,880
And tonight he'll
take that flight.

754
00:57:42,255 --> 00:57:43,455
But on his own.

755
00:57:44,122 --> 00:57:45,802
Carmen will understand.

756
00:57:46,888 --> 00:57:49,372
- How could she...?
- Don't dwell on that.

757
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:52,160
If not for her,
do it for your son.

758
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:56,190
- She'll pay me back for this!
- Calm down!

759
00:57:57,984 --> 00:58:01,056
Leave it in my hands.
You're capable of anything.

760
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:05,743
If he refuses to beat it,
then we'll have to scare him.

761
00:58:07,486 --> 00:58:09,552
You need to write a cheque now.

762
00:58:10,118 --> 00:58:11,306
A blank one.

763
00:58:11,962 --> 00:58:13,962
You'll get it clean and cheap.

764
00:58:23,137 --> 00:58:25,863
I'll drop by your house
when everything is settled.

765
00:58:26,444 --> 00:58:29,580
Affairs just end when
they reach a certain limit.

766
00:58:32,077 --> 00:58:33,360
And fast.

767
00:59:22,567 --> 00:59:24,247
<i>Open the door, please.</i>

768
00:59:25,888 --> 00:59:29,536
Mr. Vidal, so glad to find you.
My husband is gone!

769
00:59:29,591 --> 00:59:32,931
He hasn't arrived home yet. I've call
every hospital in town and his friends.

770
00:59:33,017 --> 00:59:34,297
Where can he be?

771
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:37,079
Maybe he ran away with his secretary.
I'm very busy now, I'm sorry.

772
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,373
Please help me!

773
00:59:38,501 --> 00:59:39,751
I'm sorry I can't help you.

774
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:50,880
<i>You feel alone, empty
inside, depressed...</i>

775
00:59:52,527 --> 00:59:54,860
And I swallowed
it all like a fool!

776
00:59:55,933 --> 01:00:00,472
This is what he's
after, nothing else!

777
01:00:00,605 --> 01:00:02,917
Stop it!
What do you know?

778
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:04,652
You think everybody's
as brute as you?

779
01:00:04,699 --> 01:00:07,445
If you can't think straight,
someone will have to do it for you.

780
01:00:07,492 --> 01:00:09,352
I'm sick of hearing
you tell me what to do!

781
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:11,230
Not this time, you hear me?

782
01:00:12,172 --> 01:00:13,813
- What's this?
- It'll help you sleep.

783
01:00:13,898 --> 01:00:15,219
Oh no!
I'm leaving!

784
01:00:15,328 --> 01:00:17,594
You can have it all. You can
have Carlos if you want him.

785
01:00:17,672 --> 01:00:19,633
I won't stand one more
single night in this house!

786
01:00:22,668 --> 01:00:24,734
- Andrés!
- Nobody cheats on me!

787
01:00:33,626 --> 01:00:34,626
Take this.

788
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:43,000
Good girl.

789
01:00:45,707 --> 01:00:47,191
He's beating her down.

790
01:00:47,285 --> 01:00:49,980
Get the hell out of here!
Go to sleep!

791
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:57,887
<i>Andrés!</i>

792
01:00:58,050 --> 01:00:59,050
<i>Andrés!</i>

793
01:00:59,558 --> 01:01:00,261
<i>Andrés!</i>

794
01:01:00,347 --> 01:01:01,503
Open up!

795
01:01:47,648 --> 01:01:49,328
Okay, have a good trip.

796
01:01:49,523 --> 01:01:54,125
<i>Radio Miramar. It's three minutes to
one. In a short while we'll be joined by...</i>

797
01:02:14,686 --> 01:02:17,420
Don't say a word
or I'll cut your throat.

798
01:02:17,772 --> 01:02:19,839
We're going on a trip together.

799
01:02:33,307 --> 01:02:34,307
So?

800
01:02:34,557 --> 01:02:35,565
He took the flight.

801
01:02:35,628 --> 01:02:37,471
It was easy.
He understood and went away.

802
01:02:37,573 --> 01:02:38,604
Just like that?

803
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:40,424
Two hundred and the tickets.

804
01:02:40,494 --> 01:02:43,294
I got some ideas for
the script in return.

805
01:02:43,362 --> 01:02:44,604
- Are you sleepy?
- No.

806
01:02:44,682 --> 01:02:46,377
- I'd like to discuss them.
- You can stay.

807
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:48,063
- Downstairs?
- Sure.

808
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:56,040
<i>- Where's Carmen?
- She's sleeping. - Perfect.</i>

809
01:02:56,099 --> 01:02:57,559
<i>No, I beat her.</i>

810
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:00,810
Women are complicated.

811
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:03,317
Tomorrow she'll respect you.

812
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,800
Treat her kind.

813
01:03:10,565 --> 01:03:13,200
Thank you, Luis.
Care for a drink?

814
01:03:13,872 --> 01:03:16,272
- Is that an invitation?
- Of course.

815
01:03:19,013 --> 01:03:20,133
Right on time.

816
01:03:25,179 --> 01:03:27,246
I convinced him at one o'clock.

817
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,485
At two o'clock...

818
01:03:30,922 --> 01:03:33,722
...he was climbing
the steps of the plane.

819
01:03:34,565 --> 01:03:36,085
At three o'clock...

820
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:38,482
everything's over.

821
01:03:44,549 --> 01:03:46,568
It seems we have a happy ending.

822
01:03:46,662 --> 01:03:49,328
Lover vanishes and
marriage is still on.

823
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:50,729
Do you like it?

824
01:03:52,716 --> 01:03:55,075
- That's a lot of coincidences.
- Please...

825
01:03:55,263 --> 01:03:57,543
Luckily films are just films.

826
01:03:57,652 --> 01:03:59,652
Let me carry on.
Everything's over.

827
01:03:59,934 --> 01:04:02,134
We need some
imagination at play.

828
01:04:03,949 --> 01:04:06,720
- Do you have your handgun here?
- Yes, as usual.

829
01:04:06,817 --> 01:04:07,817
Get it.

830
01:04:13,781 --> 01:04:16,148
From the war.
But it works.

831
01:04:16,703 --> 01:04:20,400
Imagine it was Fernando
who rung the bell instead of me.

832
01:04:20,469 --> 01:04:21,828
You have a quarrel, you fight...

833
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:23,720
He gets the knife
and you have the gun.

834
01:04:23,915 --> 01:04:25,595
A stab wound, a shot...

835
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:28,751
...and the story ends with the
death of both husband and lover.

836
01:04:29,641 --> 01:04:30,641
Shoot.

837
01:04:35,253 --> 01:04:37,496
And the husband dies
for being too cautious.

838
01:04:37,871 --> 01:04:39,214
It's empty.

839
01:04:40,339 --> 01:04:43,644
The bullets are here.

840
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:48,159
That's a very vulgar ending.
Nobody will believe that.

841
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:51,444
As vulgar as the reconciled
couple, don't you think?

842
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,404
Another possibility.

843
01:04:54,358 --> 01:04:56,320
The fourth character,
the blackmailer.

844
01:04:56,655 --> 01:04:59,522
I'd rather it be a young,
attractive woman.

845
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:04,659
Fernando is about to uncover her and
she knows. What does she do about it?

846
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,720
She sends me these.

847
01:05:08,895 --> 01:05:11,629
- Fernando goes away.
- But he can return.

848
01:05:12,606 --> 01:05:15,340
Not for Carmen, but
to keep on searching.

849
01:05:15,934 --> 01:05:18,622
- Too risky for her.
- A very dangerous thing to do.

850
01:05:18,903 --> 01:05:20,583
She could end up in jail.

851
01:05:22,102 --> 01:05:23,820
I don't understand any of this.

852
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:27,680
Suppose I'm the
fourth character.

853
01:05:28,531 --> 01:05:29,531
Suppose...

854
01:05:29,766 --> 01:05:32,432
The tickets, the cheque...

855
01:05:32,836 --> 01:05:34,196
It was all a lie.

856
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,647
Fernando is tied
up in the garden.

857
01:05:37,741 --> 01:05:39,741
Nobody knows you've come here.

858
01:05:40,733 --> 01:05:42,702
Nobody would hear the shot.

859
01:05:44,772 --> 01:05:47,844
You kill us both and
can still get away with it.

860
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:49,418
Then, the next day

861
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:52,393
they find the dead bodies of
the husband and his wife's lover.

862
01:05:52,557 --> 01:05:53,932
A crime of passion.

863
01:05:54,103 --> 01:05:55,623
And that's the end.

864
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,453
But Carmen can press
charges against you.

865
01:05:59,523 --> 01:06:00,711
She knows nothing.

866
01:06:00,781 --> 01:06:02,742
Both of them were
looking for a girl.

867
01:06:03,203 --> 01:06:05,093
Okay, it works.

868
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,400
But I guess...

869
01:06:09,277 --> 01:06:11,519
you'll have to build
your own scenery.

870
01:06:11,746 --> 01:06:15,040
Wiping down prints,
dropping things around...

871
01:06:21,733 --> 01:06:23,865
Do you like it like this?

872
01:06:24,733 --> 01:06:26,253
What are you doing?

873
01:08:19,282 --> 01:08:21,015
I'm pointing a gun at you.

874
01:10:06,993 --> 01:10:08,273
What's going on?

875
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,452
- What is it?
- I'm sorry.

876
01:10:11,055 --> 01:10:12,055
Excuse me.

877
01:10:13,789 --> 01:10:14,909
I was thirsty.

878
01:10:15,332 --> 01:10:16,332
I'm sorry.

879
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:19,837
- Should I change the sheet?
- No.

880
01:10:20,723 --> 01:10:22,456
It's okay.
I'm very sleepy.

881
01:10:23,035 --> 01:10:24,871
Sure.
You were tired.

882
01:10:29,228 --> 01:10:30,908
I can change it, really.

883
01:10:31,713 --> 01:10:33,233
No.
What time is it?

884
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:39,369
Two o'clock.

885
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:40,600
That's great.

886
01:10:50,768 --> 01:10:53,301
We still have plenty
of time to sleep.

887
01:11:14,586 --> 01:11:15,586
<i>Madam!
Madam!</i>

888
01:11:25,846 --> 01:11:26,846
<i>Madam!</i>

889
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,360
<i>Madam, they're dead!</i>

890
01:11:37,138 --> 01:11:38,138
Open up!

891
01:11:39,841 --> 01:11:40,841
What is it?

892
01:11:40,927 --> 01:11:43,127
The master...
he's in the office!

893
01:12:23,853 --> 01:12:27,181
Don't touch anything, madam.
We must call the police.

894
01:13:18,028 --> 01:13:19,028
Thank you.

895
01:13:25,156 --> 01:13:26,156
I'm sorry.

896
01:13:40,057 --> 01:13:41,257
I'm very sorry.

897
01:13:58,044 --> 01:14:00,400
See you, Carmen.
Take care.

898
01:14:15,977 --> 01:14:17,421
Where's the boy?

899
01:14:18,133 --> 01:14:19,805
I sent him to the
country with his uncles.

900
01:14:19,962 --> 01:14:23,290
He likes it there.
I don't want him mixed up in this.

901
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:25,770
What's wrong?

902
01:14:28,707 --> 01:14:30,640
Come with me, please.

903
01:14:47,424 --> 01:14:50,040
That's his mother.
I don't want to see her.

904
01:15:30,596 --> 01:15:32,663
You didn't love either of them.

905
01:15:34,919 --> 01:15:36,653
I thought I knew him well.

906
01:15:41,146 --> 01:15:42,826
I can hardly believe it.

907
01:15:46,508 --> 01:15:48,908
You never can tell with people.

908
01:15:49,735 --> 01:15:50,930
That's the way it is.

909
01:15:53,344 --> 01:15:54,960
Luis, I'm scared.

910
01:15:56,125 --> 01:15:57,125
Why?

911
01:15:57,263 --> 01:15:59,263
I have to testify again and...

912
01:15:59,794 --> 01:16:01,189
...I'm a bad liar.

913
01:16:01,294 --> 01:16:04,640
Do you want everyone to
know that we were lovers?

914
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:07,600
She's the only one who knows,
and they won't catch her.

915
01:16:08,888 --> 01:16:11,488
First and foremost,
you're an actress.

916
01:16:11,951 --> 01:16:13,071
Or aren't you?

917
01:16:14,162 --> 01:16:16,920
It all fits together.
You can be sure about it.

918
01:16:53,742 --> 01:16:56,960
Don't be ghoulish.
It's not funny.

919
01:17:12,702 --> 01:17:15,035
You look like a beetle.
Put this on.

920
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:21,470
How do I look?

921
01:17:22,498 --> 01:17:23,498
You're hot.

922
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:41,074
- What are we drinking to?
- You.

923
01:17:41,645 --> 01:17:43,840
Because you are finally free.

924
01:18:03,962 --> 01:18:06,029
Do you really like your hairdo?

925
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:07,415
No...

926
01:18:08,361 --> 01:18:11,103
- You should let it grow longer...
- I've always had it like this.

927
01:18:11,197 --> 01:18:12,877
Andrés liked it this way.

928
01:18:13,306 --> 01:18:14,986
You're going to change now.

929
01:18:15,189 --> 01:18:17,455
It makes me
younger and I like it.

930
01:18:18,030 --> 01:18:19,030
Come...

931
01:18:19,389 --> 01:18:20,990
I've got something for you.

932
01:18:21,225 --> 01:18:22,505
It's a surprise.

933
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:29,928
Pull the blinds and wait.

934
01:18:44,565 --> 01:18:46,165
You can come in now.

935
01:18:50,073 --> 01:18:51,279
What are you doing?

936
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:56,080
Put this wig on.
Now!

937
01:18:56,186 --> 01:18:57,920
Let go of me!
You're hurting me.

938
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:00,350
She must be like you.

939
01:19:01,606 --> 01:19:03,206
A long-haired woman.

940
01:19:04,434 --> 01:19:05,434
Tall.

941
01:19:05,802 --> 01:19:06,922
Wearing boots.

942
01:19:07,567 --> 01:19:08,700
And a skirt.

943
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:16,284
You were the blackmailer, Carmen.

944
01:19:16,441 --> 01:19:17,641
This I'm sure.

945
01:19:17,902 --> 01:19:19,300
You think you're so smart.

946
01:19:19,503 --> 01:19:20,948
What are you talking about?

947
01:19:21,019 --> 01:19:22,722
- Enough! I'm out of here.
- You stay here!

948
01:19:22,957 --> 01:19:24,557
Okay, that's enough!

949
01:19:35,574 --> 01:19:36,574
No!

950
01:19:37,514 --> 01:19:39,811
You make a loser
fall in love with you.

951
01:19:39,873 --> 01:19:42,959
He'll run away with you,
but you set him up perfectly.

952
01:19:43,937 --> 01:19:46,609
Fernando comes to pick
you up but he meets Andrés,

953
01:19:46,663 --> 01:19:48,906
who's furious as he
just received the photos.

954
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:50,360
The result:

955
01:19:51,507 --> 01:19:53,080
Free as a bird.

956
01:20:53,672 --> 01:20:54,672
Álvaro.

957
01:21:03,995 --> 01:21:04,995
Take this.

958
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,400
Anything that is not signed
will be on hold indefinitely.

959
01:21:08,534 --> 01:21:11,355
- You can't do that.
- I have powers granted on me.

960
01:21:11,511 --> 01:21:13,191
I need some fresh air.

961
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:16,907
We've got enough funds.
We'll make another kind of movies.

962
01:21:17,358 --> 01:21:19,349
Okay.
What kind?

963
01:21:19,865 --> 01:21:20,865
We'll see.

964
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:23,326
For the present we'll just finish
what's already started.

965
01:21:27,613 --> 01:21:29,293
This is not a bank, Luis.

966
01:21:29,816 --> 01:21:31,042
We can't stop.

967
01:21:31,723 --> 01:21:33,801
What about the script
you were writing?

968
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:35,699
It won't be made either.

969
01:21:35,983 --> 01:21:39,428
It would too morbid to make
such a film after what happened.

970
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,470
- Isabel!
- Yes, bye.

971
01:22:34,932 --> 01:22:36,612
Answer when I call you.

972
01:22:37,143 --> 01:22:38,143
Print this.

973
01:22:38,606 --> 01:22:40,629
Send it to distribution
and production companies.

974
01:22:40,746 --> 01:22:42,699
If you have any questions,
check the archive.

975
01:22:42,895 --> 01:22:45,839
<i>- Production manager.
- Can't you read or what?</i>

976
01:22:46,554 --> 01:22:48,827
<i> It's the second
time you fail to pay.</i>

977
01:22:49,085 --> 01:22:51,108
<i> Your husband will
know all about it today.</i>

978
01:22:51,335 --> 01:22:53,249
<i>Your honeymoon is over.</i>

979
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:55,800
<i>Goodbye, forever.</i>

980
01:23:21,853 --> 01:23:22,853
Hello?

981
01:23:22,955 --> 01:23:24,640
<i>- Is Luis there?
- One moment.</i>

982
01:23:25,598 --> 01:23:28,871
The widow's on the phone,
Mr. Production Manager.

983
01:23:39,292 --> 01:23:41,197
<i>- Carmen?
- Hi.</i>

984
01:23:41,557 --> 01:23:43,885
<i>- What's wrong?
- Are you busy?</i>

985
01:23:44,385 --> 01:23:45,775
Yes, of course.
What is it?

986
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,560
<i>You may think I'm silly,
but I need some air.</i>

987
01:23:48,713 --> 01:23:50,580
<i>Can you take a walk with me?</i>

988
01:23:51,619 --> 01:23:52,659
You mean now?

989
01:23:53,205 --> 01:23:54,885
<i>Yes, I'll pick you up.</i>

990
01:23:56,885 --> 01:23:59,680
Okay, yes.
See you, love.

991
01:25:17,678 --> 01:25:20,116
I'm going to change
the ending of the film.

992
01:25:23,155 --> 01:25:24,955
What are you talking about?

993
01:25:25,991 --> 01:25:28,560
I'm not the blackmailer.
I don't want to be.

994
01:25:32,382 --> 01:25:33,679
Give me that!

995
01:25:39,304 --> 01:25:40,680
Don't be naive.

996
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:44,808
I sent all the evidence to a notary
in case something happens to me.

997
01:25:46,568 --> 01:25:48,434
Why did you do it?
For money?

998
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:49,908
Take it easy...

999
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:52,013
I did it for you, Carmen.

1000
01:25:53,184 --> 01:25:56,240
You've never done
anything for me, Luis.

1001
01:25:56,653 --> 01:25:58,989
What did you have before
and what do you have now?

1002
01:25:59,067 --> 01:26:00,778
Can't you see the difference?

1003
01:26:03,551 --> 01:26:04,551
Carmen...

1004
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:07,660
I love you.

1005
01:26:08,535 --> 01:26:10,215
You don't love anybody.

1006
01:26:12,285 --> 01:26:13,285
Anybody.

1007
01:26:19,265 --> 01:26:22,420
This attraction stops for one
minute so you can see the view.

1008
01:26:23,593 --> 01:26:27,241
It's all the time that's left
for this lurid story to end.

1009
01:26:28,429 --> 01:26:30,366
Do you want me to jump off?

1010
01:26:31,046 --> 01:26:32,246
It's up to you.

1011
01:26:32,989 --> 01:26:35,322
They're waiting
for you down there.

1012
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:38,771
It's your life or mine.

1013
01:26:41,539 --> 01:26:43,872
If I jump off,
you'll come with me.

1014
01:26:46,086 --> 01:26:47,206
You can do it.

1015
01:26:49,305 --> 01:26:51,750
But it would be
useless and you know it.

1016
01:26:59,309 --> 01:27:00,309
Okay.

1017
01:27:01,863 --> 01:27:03,597
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

1018
01:27:04,043 --> 01:27:05,083
That's right.

1019
01:27:05,431 --> 01:27:06,431
Luis...

1020
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:10,738
Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose.

1021
01:27:26,673 --> 01:27:28,193
How long do I have?

1022
01:27:29,978 --> 01:27:31,235
Seconds.

1023
01:27:37,629 --> 01:27:38,829
And you...

1024
01:27:40,871 --> 01:27:42,738
What will you do without me?

1025
01:27:43,738 --> 01:27:44,938
What will I do?

1026
01:27:45,715 --> 01:27:46,755
I don't know.

1027
01:27:51,788 --> 01:27:53,654
But the story ends with you.
