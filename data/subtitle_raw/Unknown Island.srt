00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,879
dreamed existed the last specimens of

134
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,319
gigantic creatures that roamed the earth

135
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,440
before a man came into existence a

136
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,220
minute ago you were talking about

137
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,930

141
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:55,509
more about this deal if we want a ship

142
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,759
darling I guess you'll have to all right

143
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,310
I'll give it to you in tabloid form I

144
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,330
was a navy fly in the South Pacific

145
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,310
during the war they sent me out on a

146
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,380
solo mission scouting some Jap base I

147
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,080
caught in a typhoon blown off my course

148
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,229
I flew over hundreds of small uncharted

149
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:14,469
islands on one of these islands I saw

150
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:17,139
things live things three times the size

151
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,900
of army tanks did the Navy investigate

152
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,699
and ever reported what I saw

153
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,139
why should I those things had nothing to

154
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:25,539
do with the war sighs they might think I

155
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,460
was suffering from battle fatigue that's

156
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,500
what half cut up will you go ahead

157
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,960
husband I'm positive they were the last

158
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,760
living descendants of prehistoric

159
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,320
monsters practically unknown to modern

160
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,479
civilization you think you can find his

161
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,208
island again I'm sure of it how big is

162
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:42,578
it roughly about ten miles squared but

163
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:44,200
it was none of the usual coral atolls

164
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,459
found in that particular area the

165
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:47,500
Pacific this island had mountains and

166
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,779
deep jungle valleys parts of it were

167
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,399
barren too I believe it was the

168
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,079
remaining tip of a vast continent that

169
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:54,850
gradually sank into the sea ages ago

170
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,880
such matters I called no man a liar new

171
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,410
islands are rising and old ones are

172
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,940
sinking in the South Seas even a day

173
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,920
I've seen with my own eyes things you

174
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,020
wouldn't believe

175
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,050
yeah

176
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,080
take a look at this picture I shot it

177
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,500
from the plane

178
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,309
that looks like a large animal but it

179
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:25,589
could be a rock formation or a big

180
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:29,309
shadow or it might even be exactly what

181
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:30,990
you claim it is if Newt I tell you

182
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,480
you've walked a rather in it water like

183
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,639
some gigantic hideous sort of lizard I'm

184
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:37,079
sure Ted's right captain

185
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:39,410
sure but a thing like this takes money

186
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,779
lots of money I'm prepared to pay any

187
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,970

most sensational animal hunt on earth

strangers in on this who's Fairbanks

204
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,439
well he's a man is Sanderson was trying

205
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:27,059
to tell you about you have a lot in

206
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:27,660
common

207
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,329
you flew over this island he's been on

208
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,309
it that's impossible that's what I

209
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:34,290
thought too at first but his story

210
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,870
confirms yours yours confirms his but if

211
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,579
he's really been there why hasn't he

212
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,730
well you see he's not exactly crazy but

213
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,009
too much Sun as scramblers brains

214
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,079
we picked him up about a year ago off a

215
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,699
life raft he was nothing but skin and

216
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:50,029
balls delirious and raving about

217
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:54,120
horrible animals as big as houses what a

218
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,990
pity

219
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,149
he's been trying to blot that stuff out

220
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:59,309
of his memory ever since but drinking

221
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,670
himself to death Fairbanks is he an

222
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,819
American tax captain in the Marines we

223
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:08,999
ought to do something for him well if

224
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,649
he's actually been on this island and

225
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:13,230
what he says is true we got to take him

226
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,790
along with us he might come in handy

227
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,670
that's what I figured how did he ever

228
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,389
find it

229
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:21,300
he didn't it found him it seems that he

230
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,649

231
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,059

348
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,560
quicker having your throat cut by

349
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,040
