00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:57,425
and said that the perfect job
he had set up
was gonna fall through.

4
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,960
He told me his new partner
got hit by a bus.

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,395
Now, that was kind of unusual.

6
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,397
Nick never talked much
about work before,

7
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:04,965
and we go way back, you know?

8
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,401
That's right, all the way back
to reform school.

9
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:10,003
So when he called me up
and said the perfect job

10
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:13,006
just might fall through
because his new partner
got hit by a bus,

11
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:15,643
I was pretty surprised.
And interested.

12
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,545
You see, I always wanted
to work with Nick,

13
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,380
so I says, "What about me?"

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,814
He didn't know.

15
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,517
But I begged, and I told him
I'd be real good.

16
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,853
So finally he says okay.

17
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:29,923
But between you and me,
I always kind of felt
that it was, you know,

18
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,992
against his better judgment.

19
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,162
I remember Nick always saying,

20
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:37,165
"Jewels and dames:
If you get one,
you got the other."

21
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:38,966
And he's right.

22
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,469
We have been
chasing skirts forever.

23
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,271
So anyway, we get together,

24
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:45,739
and he tells me he's investing
500 grand of his own,

25
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,641
everything he made
on the Newport job.

26
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,577
So he says to me,

27
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:53,147
"Listen, kiddo,
we'll walk away with at least
a million and a half.

28
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:55,816
Each.
And the train leaves tomorrow."

29
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,886
Nick doesn't fly.
Too many things can go wrong.

30
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,054
You see, when you get
to know a guy good,

31
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:02,656
you get to know what he likes.

32
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,425
You can tell
what he's gonna do.

33
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,395
Well, you see,
that's where I was wrong.

34
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:10,598
I never figured it would
turn out like it did.

35
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,867
She was a...
different kind of broad.

36
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,870
Not his kind of dame.
Certainly not mine.

37
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,509
Anyway, he said that he had
worked out the perfect
psychological heist.

38
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,311
I had to look that one up.

00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,406
Well, goodbye.

352
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,742
Goodbye.

353
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,645
Goodbye.

354
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,548
[**]

355
00:16:30,557 --> 00:16:33,093
Hmm...interesting.

356
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:53,746
Good morning, madam.
How are you today?

357
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,814
Good morning.

358
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,454
Madame,
may I help you?

359
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,391
Uh, well, I'd like to
see the manager, please.

360
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,259
Certainly.
Thank you, darling, thank you.

361
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,662
NICK:
You wanna hear something
amazing, Charlie?

362
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:10,997
CHARLIE:
Yeah, I would.

363
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,999
It's an amazing thing
that a banana like you

364
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,867
is gonna participate

365
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,737
in the most stunning
psychological heist
this town has ever seen.

366
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,140
When the cops
got us surrounded,

367
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,842
I hope you remember
to bring your psychology.

368
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:24,377
You wanted to see me,
madam?

369
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,213
Oh, y yes, uh,

370
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:30,550
you see, during the week, uh,
my brother, Mr. Phelps Graham,

371
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,819
Uh, you are the manager,
aren't you?
I am, yes.

372
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,088
Yes, well, my brother was in,
Mr. Phelps Graham,

373
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,190
and he bought some ear clips
for his wife, Ethel.

374
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,925
Oh, yes, Mr. Phelps Graham,
lovely man.

375
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,027
Yes, well, they won't do.
They're just not right.

376
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:42,629
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's the problem?

377
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,897
Well, she doesn't
like them.
Oh, I see.

378
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,700
Well, unfortunately, madam,
once goods have left--

379
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,636
Well, I can't
return them.

380
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,871
Oh, I beg your pardon.
You want to exchange them.

381
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,240
No, I can't
do that either.

382
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,542
Oh, may I have a glass
of water, please?

383
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,344
Oh, surely.
Um, we, uh--

384
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,346
Susan, a glass of water
for the lady.

385
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,581
Here they are. Yes.
You see, my problem is,

386
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:05,585
I don't want my brother
to know that his wife
didn't like the clips.

387
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,986
I'm very close
to my brother,

388
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,655
and I don't want to
see him hurt.

389
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,656
Of course not.
Yes.

390
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,090
So, what I thought
I'd do is,

391
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,959
I'd just tell him that she
adored the clips,

392
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,927
and we'll get
a bracelet to go with it.

393
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,230
What do you think?
I think that's a wonderful idea.

394
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,332
Good. Well, that's very good
for you, isn't it?

395
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,734
I suppose it is, yes.
Yes, yes, it is, yes.

396
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,572
Uh, now, the problem's
going to be to find
something to please Ethel,

397
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:28,040
which is not going to be easy,
but we'll do that.

398
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,842
Oh, I'm sure we will.
Yes, we will.

399
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,110
I'm so nervous
about all this.

400
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,612
Now, there's no need
for that, madam.

401
00:18:32,712 --> 00:18:33,913
Yes, well,
you'll help me.

402
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:35,215
We'll choose something
together.

403
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,217
Oh, thank you.

404
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,452
It's very difficult.

405
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:40,753
I suggest, madam,

406
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,556
that we eliminate
the gray Tahitian pearls.

407
00:18:43,656 --> 00:18:45,392
She's very sick,
you know.

408
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:46,393
Yes, I heard.

409
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:48,228
But she's always
been fussy.

410
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:49,329
Particular.

411
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,497
Impossible.

412
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,599
Yes, it must be
quite a strain for you.

413
00:18:52,699 --> 00:18:54,000
Well, I don't know
where to turn.

414
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,702
Very difficult.
But I-I'm sure you manage.

415
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,537
Well, I do my best.

416
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,005
It's a family trait,
you know.

417
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,840
My father
was that way.

418
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,210
We never knew what
he was going through.

419
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,877
Well, I'm the same way.

420
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,613
I keep it all inside.

421
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,415
People don't wanna
hear your troubles.

422
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:11,884
Th-that's a lovely piece
you're wearing.

423
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,353
Oh.

424
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,654
Thank you.

425
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,189
My mother's.

426
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,224
Really?
Yes.

427
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:18,925
It's French, you know.
Is it?

428
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,360
Yes. It's a Dufawn.

429
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,829
It is?
Very rare.

430
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,197
And who is Dufawn?

431
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,366
Well, he's a famous
French jewelry maker.

432
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:28,167
And well-known is he?
Oh, indeed he is.

433
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:29,602
Oh, wonderful.
Uh--

434
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,605
I didn't recognize the name,
but I do know quality.

435
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,274
Oh, and it shows.

436
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:35,608
Oh.

437
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:36,943
Oh, thank you.

438
00:19:37,043 --> 00:19:39,312
And what is your name?
Edward Saunders, Madame.

439
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,248
And may I call you Edward.

440
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,882
By all means.
Yes.

441
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:45,818
I knew an Edward once,
but I don't want to
get into that.

442
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,086
Too...

443
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,489
Uh, now where was I?
Well, I was suggesting, madam,

444
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,591
that we eliminated
the gray Tahitian pearls.

445
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,561
You know, it used to be
so much simpler.

446
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:57,730
At one time, Ethel's
only passion was ice cream.

447
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,532
Oh, really?
Well, I can appreciate that.

448
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:03,236
Yes, but a pint of Rocky Road
costs less than a star sapphire.

449
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,638
[CHUCKLING]
Yes, madam, very good.

450
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:09,041
And, madam, uh,
it's a sweeter investment.

451
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,611
You're witty.
Very witty.

452
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,680
Uh - I don't want to
sway you unduly, madam,

453
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,083
but my feeling is that
the diamond bracelet that you
were originally attracted to--

454
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,618
Do you think so?
I do.

455
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:22,255
Well, I'll take that one.
It's enough dallying. It's done.

456
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,324
An excellent choice, madam.
Yes. How much is it?

457
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:25,758
Sixty thousand dollars.

458
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,960
Well, round numbers
this time.

459
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,762
R-round numbers?
Yes, round.

460
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,564
Oh, your brother.
Oh, he told you.

461
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:34,301
He did. Yes.
Oh, he felt so badly.

462
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,069
Well, you know, he wanted me
to apologize to you for him.

463
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,272
Madam, I understood perfectly.

464
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:40,507
What did I buy?

465
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:43,175
Well, for Ethel,
this beautiful diamond bracelet.

466
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:44,477
Oh, yes, the diamond.

467
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,146
Now very important,
Edward...

468
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,783
my brother must never know
that his wife didn't like
the ear clips.

469
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,685
Madam, you can rely on me.

470
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:55,221
Because he would be very hurt.

471
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:56,589
He loves her.

472
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:59,025
Don't ask me why.

473
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:02,094
Madam, it can be our secret.

474
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:04,564
[**]

475
00:21:04,664 --> 00:21:06,933
EDWARD:
Your lovely, madam.
Thank you so much.

476
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:09,101
I do hope your sister-in-law
likes the bracelet.

477
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,470
Oh, I'm sure she will.

478
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,504
Bye-bye now, madam.

479
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,005
My best wishes
to your brother.

480
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,474
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

481
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,476
Thank you so much.
Thank you for your courtesy.

482
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:19,011
Thank you, madam.
Bye-bye.

483
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:25,084
Excuse me for interrupting,

484
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,321
but I must tell you what
a pleasure it is to look at you.

485
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:29,756
[GIGGLES]

486
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:32,124
Now that you're beautiful,
that goes without saying,

487
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:34,427
but you have quality.

488
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:37,163
Thank you.
How very nice of you.
Yes.

489
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:41,067
The way you've done your hair,
and that lovely blouse
and smart skirt.

490
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:44,904
Quality.
Very rare these days.

491
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,039
And I think I can say
the same for you.

492
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,775
Well, never mind
about that.

493
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,444
And the smile,
quite lovely.

494
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,680
Well, Merry Christmas,
darling.

495
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,081
Same to you.

496
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:57,249
Oh, a Louis the 16th table
and quite nice.

497
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,686
I must tell my brother
about that.

498
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:00,987
Bye-bye.

499
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:04,657
As my father used to say,
you're the real McCoy.

500
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:07,427
Too-da-loo.

501
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:09,862
Now.

[**]

503
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:26,145
Point number two:
13 seconds,

504
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:29,081
passing the Epicurean,
it's a restaurant.

505
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,651
Point number three,
33 seconds, passing Gucci's.

506
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,923
It's a nice straight line
now, step on it.

507
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:37,924
Go ahead, hit it.

508
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,260
Point number four,
passing the Eloquitz.

509
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,764
Point number five:
55 seconds, marina guards.

510
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:05,452
Point number six,
one minute, 17 seconds;
you arrive at the boat.

511
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,923
Point number seven:
one minute, 32 seconds;

512
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:13,059
stow the jewels
and anchors away.

513

CHARLIE:
Now, this is what
I'm waiting for.

514
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,764
Nick on the job,

515
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:19,932
like a... A fine-tuned clock.

516
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:22,769
He was something.
All concentration.

517
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:25,872
But he wasn't listening to me.

518
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:28,240
I still think you
should split when I do.

519
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,076
Let me see.
Give me the watch.

520
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,410
