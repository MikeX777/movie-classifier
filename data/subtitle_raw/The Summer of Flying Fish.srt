1
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,040
THE SUMMER OF FLYING FISH
two
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,656
Row harder!

2
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,358
Hey fa!

3
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:34,691
Ephah, come.

4
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:40,398
Come here.

5
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:29,555
Hey fa!

6
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:24,170
I don't see them!

7
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:25,254
Hang on.

8
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:29,253
-Rosa, where are the boys?
-I don't know. I do not know anything.

9
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:31,211
Call me back in an hour.

10
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:33,793
Wait, are you coming or not?

11
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,334
Will you leave me alone
with the children?

12
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,625
We had decided to do something else!

13
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,748
Would it have been asking a lot for you 
to have let me know?

14
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:51,040
Dad, I was at the hot springs.

15
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,540
So early?

16
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:55,539
Yes, it was great.
There was no one there.

17
00:05:00,788 --> 00:05:03,329
Esther, tell her.

18
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:08,453
You have to be careful.

19
00:05:09,162 --> 00:05:10,829
The climate can change.

20
00:05:11,452 --> 00:05:13,119
You might get lost.

21
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:18,535
When the Huaca Mauhida closes,
I don't want you to go out anymore.

22
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:35,739
Did you hear me?

23
00:05:36,281 --> 00:05:37,781
Do you believe these stories?

24
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:40,447
Next time, leave a note.

25
00:06:17,648 --> 00:06:19,106
Fuck!

26
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,480
Did you read the interview
with the engineer of the building that collapsed?

27
00:06:23,647 --> 00:06:25,105
Listen:

28
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,771
"Do you think these
plans of yours were okay?"

29
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:30,354
"I think so."

30
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:32,023
"If someone at the construction company had

31
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:34,022
any questions,
would they have called you?"

32
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:36,062
"Yes".
"Did they call?"

33
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,560
"Not that I remember"

34
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:39,519
"Do you want to read the book of the work?"

35
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:41,936
"No, I think it's boring as hell.

36
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,269
For each building,

37
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:44,936
you fill out three notebooks."

38
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:47,351
"But this one is only six pages long."

39
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:50,893
"So. It was a fantastically 
coordinated construction.

40
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:52,226
There was no problem at all."

41
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:53,599
Come on!

42
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,183
And it keeps going...

43
00:07:20,054 --> 00:07:21,887
-Come on!
-But why?

44
00:07:22,053 --> 00:07:23,844
-Come on, Francisco!
-Listen to me!

45
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,969
Let's go.

46
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:37,508
It's great.

47
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:39,175
Beautiful.

48
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:41,507
Let's go for a run.

49
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,499
She has wine in her mouth...
You have to spit it out!

50
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:25,624
But not here!

51
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,081
Wood.

52
00:08:31,248 --> 00:08:32,372
Wood...

53
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:37,704
Chocolate?

54
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,453
Strawberry.

55
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,536
He's going to have dinner with us.

56
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:48,953
Wait.

57
00:08:49,452 --> 00:08:51,327
Bring him a glass.

58
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:52,911
-Hello.
-Lorca!

59
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:54,786
-All good?
-All!

60
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,118
-Hello.
-How are you?

61
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,993
It should taste good...
All good?

62
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:00,325
With the taste...

63
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,616
-Wine?
-Yes please.

64
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:08,615
Esther, a glass, please.

65
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:11,323
Thanks.

66
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:13,823
-So, how are you?
-Good! And you?

67
00:09:14,073 --> 00:09:15,405
-Pancho...
-Yes?

68
00:09:15,614 --> 00:09:19,322
Did you read the article
in the Sunday paper?

69
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:20,613
No. What article?

70
00:09:20,738 --> 00:09:23,571
A new SPA has opened in Santiago.

71
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:27,154
They use carp to
give you a pedicure.

72
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,694
Really!

73
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,277
You put your feet in a tank

74
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,861
and the carp eat the calluses.

75
00:09:39,777 --> 00:09:43,901
You should do the same thing:
Open a SPA with all your carp.

76
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,109
Why don't you drain the pond,

77
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:50,607
let the carp die,
then fill the pond again?

78
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:53,232
Drain the pond. Good idea!

79
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:55,149
Who gets the cork?

80
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:58,774
-You or me?
-Oh dad, don't be annoying.

81
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:00,981
Well, someone has to do it.

82
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:05,855
Pancho, someone told me that carp
were introduced from somwhere else.

83
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,437
These carp are native to the Ura River,

84
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:11,561
on the border between China and Russia.

85
00:10:11,728 --> 00:10:14,228
They brought them to eat the seaweed,

86
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:17,602
but Cucho didn't know
that they reproduced so quickly.

87
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,477
How did they bring them here?

88
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,726
They were brought
in special tanks with water.

89
00:10:23,977 --> 00:10:26,976
-Where did you get that from? Nothing to see!
-And truth!

90
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:32,058
No, my father invented these stories.
Carp have been here forever.

91
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:35,057
Before there was a camp.

92
00:10:41,598 --> 00:10:43,056
Pancho doesn't understand anything...

93
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:48,388
Holy crap! Again!...

94
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:49,637
What it was?

95
00:11:57,001 --> 00:11:59,374
Hey? Francisco?

96
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:04,790
No, it's just the dogs.
That is all.

97
00:12:10,123 --> 00:12:11,289
Until.

98
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,653
They say a lamppost
was taken down last night.

99
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:06,738
Again?

100
00:13:07,195 --> 00:13:09,903
So it was.

101
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:23,233
Do you know who was messing
around last night?

102
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:26,775
Do you want a cup of tea?

103
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:30,899
Aren't they your friends?

104
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:38,522
Why don't you study more

105
00:13:39,564 --> 00:13:41,897
instead of making a mess?

106
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:45,813
What mess?

107
00:13:48,187 --> 00:13:49,937
It's better not to get involved.

108
00:13:52,561 --> 00:13:54,477
<i>Otherwise, El Cuero will take you.</i>

109
00:14:03,225 --> 00:14:07,934
Look, we spent two weeks
on a yacht in Belize.

110
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,598
I had never seen such a beautiful sea.

111
00:14:11,766 --> 00:14:14,473
We went to a place called
Ambergris Caye.

112
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,305
We swam among sharks.
They were savages. It was amazing.

113
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:21,098
-And the women?
-A few.

114
00:14:21,806 --> 00:14:23,931
Few and fat.

115
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:26,346
I didn't like that.

116
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:29,345
I would go again though,
because the place was divine.

117
00:14:30,262 --> 00:14:31,721
-Shit!
-Come on!

118
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:33,386
What is this?

119
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:39,970
I hope it nothing happened 
with the car.

120
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:41,218
It is not alright.

121
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:42,969
We were lucky.

122
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:45,719
You could have broken the windshield.

123
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:50,801
What is happening?

124
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:57,507
I don't believe this.

125
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:01,132
These police officers are very aggressive!

126
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:04,881
Take another path.

127
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,505
Stop!

128
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:11,504
-Stop, man!
-Okay, let's go back.

129
00:15:16,921 --> 00:15:18,627
Look how they just grabbed him!

130
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:23,293
They must have done something, otherwise
they wouldn't be grabbing them like that.

131
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:27,752
They are very subversive.

132
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,273
There's more there.

133
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,042
Why is this girl
covered in blood in that part?

134
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:15,084
It wasn't blood, actually.

135
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:19,415
It's not blood, it's raspberry juice.

136
00:19:20,957 --> 00:19:22,956
The house is made of candy.

137
00:19:23,082 --> 00:19:26,288
The girl is there for the composition.

138
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,197
You, huh?

139
00:20:09,364 --> 00:20:11,197
Me?

140
00:20:37,692 --> 00:20:39,358
Do you like it?

141
00:20:39,608 --> 00:20:40,441
Yes?

142
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:43,941
Which do you prefer?

143
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,107
This or this one?

144
00:20:46,815 --> 00:20:48,649
I prefer this one.

145
00:20:49,356 --> 00:20:50,815
I like them all.

146
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:53,356
I like these one-piece ones.

147
00:20:53,605 --> 00:20:56,022
I like bikinis.

148
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:58,855
Also...

149
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,855
I forgot the word!

150
00:21:01,395 --> 00:21:02,562
Man...

151
00:21:03,561 --> 00:21:04,896
Where were you?

152
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:06,603
With Lorca.

153
00:21:08,811 --> 00:21:09,811
AND?

154
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:13,518
What?

155
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:14,935
What did they do?

156
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:16,852
Nothing.

157
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:20,768
Liar! I know you.

158
00:21:21,018 --> 00:21:23,558
-Do you like him?
-Nothing to see!

159
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:31,807
He might come for
vacation the last week.

160
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:37,056
Want to go swiming?

161
00:21:54,969 --> 00:21:56,551
They are very ugly.

162
00:21:56,677 --> 00:21:59,134
No! They are beautiful.

163
00:22:01,217 --> 00:22:02,760
Stop, Manena.

164
00:22:02,926 --> 00:22:05,216
Otherwise the few I have will run away.

165
00:22:05,383 --> 00:22:08,132
Doing this will we see
how they manage to escape?

166
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:10,799
No, many have already fled!

167
00:22:11,174 --> 00:22:12,050
Many have already fled.

168
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,663
Daddy!

169
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,954
Get the boys out of there!

170
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,078
Stay calm,
they are having fun!

171
00:23:18,244 --> 00:23:20,911
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

172
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:29,076
Go, Pedro.

173
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,575
The wick is very long,
so you have time to leave.

174
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:36,658
Light it and wait for the wick to burn
a little, before throwing it.

175
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:45,823
Pedro! Pedro!

176
00:24:09,151 --> 00:24:11,735
-Fuck!
-Holy shit!

177
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,606
Why did you leave
for dad to use the explosive?

178
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:40,395
What did you want me to do?

179
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,687
How delicious.

180
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:45,311
You never do anything, mom!

181
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:48,102
Man...

182
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:49,268
Thanks...

183
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:52,143
You know your father
better than me.

184
00:24:57,018 --> 00:24:58,809
What happened to the carp?

185
00:24:58,934 --> 00:25:00,892
I don't know and I don't care.

186
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:03,515
The carp flew away.

187
00:25:12,682 --> 00:25:15,848
<i>Rodrigo, in Temuco. Good morning.</i>

188
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:16,848
<i>Good morning.</i>

189
00:25:16,972 --> 00:25:20,055
<i>Police are investigating</i>

190
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:21,971
<i>the attack on the helicopter</i>

191
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:27,177
<i>they confirmed that nine 
millimeter bullets were used.</i>

192
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:32,011
<i>According to the investigation,
seven masked men participated.</i>

193
00:25:32,218 --> 00:25:38,211
<i>Shortly before, the helicopter had
left five firefighters on land</i>

194
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:42,676
<i>to control fires
in forest plantations.</i>

195
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:46,465
<i>The firefighters fled in panic...</i>

196
00:26:52,037 --> 00:26:54,494
I think Rosa is right.

197
00:26:54,662 --> 00:26:57,536
The carp must be
hidden in the mud.

198
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:00,119
I don't think I killed them all but...

199
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,285
-They were definitely dead.
-Clown.

200
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:05,827
I left them dead.

201
00:27:13,116 --> 00:27:17,532
Why don't we ride
a business with triple...

202
00:27:17,658 --> 00:27:18,782
-Triplets.
-Triploids.

203
00:27:18,907 --> 00:27:20,824
-Triple...
-Speak.

204
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:22,322
-Tri-ploy-de.
-Triploid.

205
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:24,864
They have triploids and diploids.

206
00:27:25,031 --> 00:27:27,446
Triploids have
three pairs of chromosomes.

207
00:27:27,614 --> 00:27:29,655
And diploids have two.
Ask how I know?

208
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:34,029
Triploids do not reach the
sexual maturity and do not reproduce.

209
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:38,571
-Why didn't Cucho say it before?
-Forget my father...

210
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:41,028
These carp have always been here.

211
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:44,235
Dad, they want to know if the package arrived
from the Santa Margarita farm.

212
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:47,109
Yes, of course, I already told them.

213
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:48,484
He says it has arrived.

214
00:27:48,652 --> 00:27:53,441
Where can we find these triploids?

215
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,315
They need to be genetically modified.

216
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:00,315
-It is not easy to find them in nature.
-No?

217
00:28:00,524 --> 00:28:02,148
-Father...
-Hey?

218
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:04,815
It looks like Pedro 
broke the eardrum.

219
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:09,272
-Carlos could examine it.
-The eardrums regenerate on their own.

220
00:28:11,939 --> 00:28:15,896
Esther is drunk! 
We drink and she gets drunk!

221
00:28:16,688 --> 00:28:18,145
Cheers to that!

222
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:34,851
Take her out of the water.

223
00:28:34,976 --> 00:28:36,475
Take her out yourself.

224
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:42,224
Stay alive!

225
00:28:47,974 --> 00:28:50,264
Prepare her. I'm going to step on it.

226
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:51,722
No!

227
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:57,013
Poor thing, she's dying.

228
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:59,263
-Do I step on her face?
-Yes.

229
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:21,634
Hey.

230
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,174
I brought the check to the hospital.

231
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,713
You better get checked out.
Just to make sure.

232
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:41,337
No, I'm better now.

233
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:55,961
He is well...

234
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:42,117
I wanted to talk to you.

235
00:30:42,284 --> 00:30:43,159
What?

236
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:44,826
Come on, I'll talk on the way.

237
00:31:08,404 --> 00:31:10,029
My mother-in-law's mare...

238
00:31:10,655 --> 00:31:12,695
Is your mother-in-law a mare?

239
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,570
No! Leave my mother-in-law alone!

240
00:31:24,235 --> 00:31:25,442
Sir.

241
00:31:26,568 --> 00:31:30,025
Thank you very much. They're very good.
I've already eaten four.

242
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:33,651
What I do not understand
about this is recovering the land.

243
00:31:33,816 --> 00:31:35,525
They talk about historical debt.

244
00:31:35,691 --> 00:31:39,398
What historical debt?
They never owned anything!

245
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:42,023
-Your ancestors did.
-No!

246
00:31:42,189 --> 00:31:44,773
They were hunters and gatherers.

247
00:31:44,898 --> 00:31:47,188
Their agriculture was minimal.

248
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:49,396
They just passed through this forest.

249
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:53,563
They enjoyed the forest.

250
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:54,896
They weren't the owners.

251
00:31:55,062 --> 00:31:58,604
Everyone has a Mapuche ancestor!

252
00:31:58,771 --> 00:32:02,645
I'm going to change my last name to
Huallipan or some other with two "L".

253
00:32:02,811 --> 00:32:04,810
His last name is "Ovalle"
There are two "L"s!

254
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,644
I can see your feathers now!

255
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:12,809
You come from Santiago
to fill my bag!

256
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:15,183
You articulate very well!

257
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:19,474
What's with Lorca?

258
00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:21,474
Are you invading her territory?

259
00:32:21,641 --> 00:32:23,807
As long as he doesn't invade everything,
it is all good...

260
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:28,181
He's a nice guy. Talented.

261
00:32:28,388 --> 00:32:29,598
Have you seen his paintings?

262
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:31,764
He comes more than you!

263
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:35,471
Turn!

264
00:32:36,262 --> 00:32:37,971
A little more...

265
00:32:38,137 --> 00:32:40,261
Go, you can do it!

266
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,720
Stop! You are on the edge!

267
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,133
Stop! He is well.

268
00:34:03,995 --> 00:34:05,120
Pedro!

269
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:06,704
Pedro!

270
00:34:08,787 --> 00:34:10,119
Come here.

271
00:34:14,785 --> 00:34:15,744
Yes?

272
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:17,202
Come.

273
00:34:17,744 --> 00:34:19,326
Sit down.

274
00:34:28,658 --> 00:34:31,616
Houston, we have a problem.

275
00:34:31,782 --> 00:34:32,824
That

276
00:34:42,988 --> 00:34:44,113
Pedro...

277
00:35:14,524 --> 00:35:17,106
You ate...

278
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:19,981
that foreigner from last time?

279
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,690
Remember, at that party?

280
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:24,647
-No, that doesn't count.
-Why?

281
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:26,564
Pedro is a gentleman!

282
00:35:26,731 --> 00:35:29,897
She just wanted to give it to you!

283
00:35:35,187 --> 00:35:36,269
Here.

284
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:38,895
She was a little chubby...

285
00:35:39,352 --> 00:35:40,936
but fiery!

286
00:35:41,144 --> 00:35:43,185
She likes the local product.

287
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,935
Hot brunette!

288
00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:09,836
-I didn't understand.
-Did not you like it?

289
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:12,001
The two of them alone in New York.

290
00:37:13,293 --> 00:37:14,710
Mom won't go?

291
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:17,083
She hates New York.

292
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,291
-You're going to be pissed.
-That's not your problem.

293
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,373
I could have asked before.

294
00:37:25,541 --> 00:37:28,290
You wanted to see Manhattan!

295
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:31,123
Yes father. Not now.

296
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,747
You stink of marijuana.

297
00:37:34,914 --> 00:37:36,371
No, that is not it.

298
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:38,664
Liar.

299
00:37:43,078 --> 00:37:46,244
Is it true that you are putting up
an electric fence?

300
00:37:46,454 --> 00:37:48,327
Since when are you interested
in the farm?

301
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:49,411
Honestly?

302
00:37:49,495 --> 00:37:51,828
Of course!
How did you know I planned to 
install an electric fence?

303
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:55,453
A guy from the community told me.

304
00:37:55,702 --> 00:37:57,743
We are surrounding the
hazelnut plantations.

305
00:37:58,284 --> 00:38:00,493
With barbed wire.

306
00:38:01,242 --> 00:38:03,074
These bastards destroyed it.

307
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:07,240
-Why so many fences?
-Because of the cattle and the thieves.

308
00:38:07,491 --> 00:38:09,824
What's wrong?

309
00:38:10,491 --> 00:38:12,157
The farm is mine.

310
00:38:17,405 --> 00:38:20,071
You should be grateful
for the privileges you has.

311
00:38:21,071 --> 00:38:24,404
Woe to you if I find out 
you are smoking marijuana!

312
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:54,065
Ecstasy!

313
00:39:29,308 --> 00:39:30,809
It looks like a pudu.

314
00:39:31,141 --> 00:39:32,182
A pudu?

315
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:33,850
You are very small!

316
00:39:34,683 --> 00:39:37,433
-What was that song?
-What song?

317
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,765
No, idiot!

318
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:43,305
It was this...

319
00:39:43,473 --> 00:39:45,972
The other, by Luis Miguel.

320
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,388
Luis Miguel's.

321
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:51,471
<i>I'll forget you</i>

322
00:39:52,262 --> 00:39:54,471
<i>Word of honor</i>

323
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,259
You don't have it anymore, right?
Good thing we smoked everything!

324
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:03,124
Cool!

325
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:06,373
-Weren't you afraid?
-No.

326
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:07,914
I was!

327
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:35,451
Your Carlos...

328
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,991
Have you seen Chiquinho?

329
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,575
No.

330
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,241
Scales are growing on him.

331
00:41:46,116 --> 00:41:48,115
-Scales?
-Yes.

332
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:52,947
-Like fish?
-Yes.

333
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:54,823
Like fish.

334
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,030
So try not to fish it out!

335
00:41:58,113 --> 00:41:59,489
It was a joke...

336
00:42:00,029 --> 00:42:01,571
It's dermatitis.

337
00:42:02,237 --> 00:42:04,112
Contact dermatitis.

338
00:42:06,821 --> 00:42:08,695
We have to change our washing powder.

339
00:42:15,777 --> 00:42:18,485
-Ester, can you bring me some juice?
-Yes.

340
00:42:21,776 --> 00:42:23,942
Funny woman...

341
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,681
Pedro, come here, please.

342
00:43:33,886 --> 00:43:35,886
Can we do anything?

343
00:43:36,053 --> 00:43:38,470
We have a filtration problem...

344
00:43:38,637 --> 00:43:42,134
Pedro, I have a problem
with the cages.

345
00:43:42,218 --> 00:43:43,511
-See?
-Yes.

346
00:43:43,636 --> 00:43:45,218
-They are sinking.
-Yes.

347
00:43:45,386 --> 00:43:48,217
They are losing tension
and they are sinking all the others.

348
00:43:48,385 --> 00:43:50,467
-Can you fix this, please?
-Yes.

349
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:53,007
Hey, wait!

350
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:57,758
It looks like someone
sent me a message.

351
00:44:00,215 --> 00:44:01,382
What?

352
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,214
Didn't you hear?

353
00:44:08,464 --> 00:44:09,879
Are you talking about the fences?

354
00:44:10,088 --> 00:44:12,171
I don't know. You tell me.

355
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:18,003
The community is not happy.

356
00:44:18,712 --> 00:44:22,461
They say they have the right to go
anywhere to hunt.

357
00:44:22,628 --> 00:44:25,001
You put
fences on the other side.

358
00:44:26,461 --> 00:44:28,627
Tell the little brothers Huentrún

359
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,667
that if they have any problems,
they can come directly to me.

360
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:35,667
-Anything else?
-No.

361
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:39,458
No! I forgot one thing!

362
00:44:40,998 --> 00:44:42,956
I need sluts.

363
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:51,830
Look at his face!

364
00:44:52,498 --> 00:44:54,245
Just kidding!

365
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:56,663
You have no sense of humor!

366
00:44:57,746 --> 00:44:59,204
What a sucker.

367
00:45:00,994 --> 00:45:04,620
-Piranhas aren't a bad idea.
-Yeah, maybe.

368
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:06,160
A little radical.

369
00:46:24,187 --> 00:46:26,020
Who has a pig face?

370
00:46:26,645 --> 00:46:28,437
-Me?
-Yes.

371
00:46:28,645 --> 00:46:32,019
I have a pig face.
Exactly.

372
00:46:32,186 --> 00:46:33,186
There.

373
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:39,018
This embroidery is beautiful!

374
00:46:39,184 --> 00:46:41,352
Leave me alone, Pancho.

375
00:46:41,518 --> 00:46:43,351
I'm fed up. This is bullshit.

376
00:46:43,517 --> 00:46:45,601
-It's not a joke.
-Yes.

377
00:46:46,224 --> 00:46:49,391
-You're kidding me.
-I'm not kidding.

378
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:50,350
It's your turn.

379
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,391
I'm not kidding.

380
00:46:52,475 --> 00:46:53,307
Daddy!

381
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:55,766
You are making fun of me
and my activities.

382
00:46:55,848 --> 00:46:58,556
-No, it was a joke.
-Clearly.

383
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:00,806
You are very serious.

384
00:47:01,263 --> 00:47:02,597
I am tired.

385
00:47:07,472 --> 00:47:08,928
I think I'll win.

386
00:47:10,178 --> 00:47:11,554
I decided that today I will win.

387
00:47:11,637 --> 00:47:15,428
I never noticed the elephant in that
ring. I thought it was a moth.

388
00:47:15,595 --> 00:47:17,010
-Francisco!
-What is it?

389
00:47:17,177 --> 00:47:18,345
He wants to talk to you.

390
00:47:18,428 --> 00:47:21,344
-Good morning, Mr. Francisco.
-Good morning. How are you, Juan?

391
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,217
-More or less the same!
-Why?

392
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:26,426
Your dog
killed my sheep.

393
00:47:36,132 --> 00:47:40,548
-How do you know it was my dog?
-Because I hit him in the head.

394
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:45,255
-How much did the sheep cost?
-40,000 pesos.

395
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,004
Dude sheep, huh?

396
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:57,836
Do you have 10,000, love?

397
00:47:58,044 --> 00:48:00,002
10,000 pesos?

398
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:12,584
Count it.

399
00:48:18,374 --> 00:48:19,708
It is true.

400
00:48:19,873 --> 00:48:21,081
See you soon, Mr. Francisco.

401
00:48:21,248 --> 00:48:24,582
Pedro, take this animal, please.

402
00:48:48,201 --> 00:48:52,284
Sing that Handel aria 
and stop pouring wine over me.

403
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:55,074
Come on, sing.

404
00:48:55,659 --> 00:48:56,617
Go!

405
00:48:57,866 --> 00:48:59,033
Do you remember?

406
00:49:03,657 --> 00:49:05,782
Sing "Per La Finestra".

407
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:09,989
<i>Voglio enter for the finesse</i>

408
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:14,113
<i>Voglio "bebere"
this "little wine"</i>

409
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:17,070
"Good Good".

410
00:49:17,237 --> 00:49:18,820
Do you remember Monicaco?

411
00:49:19,779 --> 00:49:20,738
The comedian?

412
00:49:20,903 --> 00:49:22,654
"Good Good".

413
00:49:22,819 --> 00:49:24,069
Funny.

414
00:49:24,986 --> 00:49:28,403
What happened to Monicaco?
He was good.

415
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,777
What is this?

416
00:49:30,276 --> 00:49:31,652
Shit! Again...

417
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:33,337
<i>Congratulations to you</i>

418
00:51:33,628 --> 00:51:38,628
<i>On this beloved date</i>

419
00:51:38,835 --> 00:51:44,543
<i>Congratulations grandfather Cucho</i>

420
00:51:44,959 --> 00:51:49,916
<i>We'll give you a saw</i>

421
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:53,790
So you can cut.

422
00:51:54,375 --> 00:51:56,040
Alive!

423
00:52:07,414 --> 00:52:09,079
Congratulations, Dad.

424
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:13,787
May all your desires
become reality.

425
00:52:24,076 --> 00:52:25,369
Cucho!

426
00:52:28,618 --> 00:52:29,866
Hello!

427
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:11,984
No! Rest assured.

428
00:53:19,317 --> 00:53:22,023
I'll send Nacho to resolve it.

429
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:25,148
Right? Understood?

430
00:53:25,315 --> 00:53:26,524
He is well. Goodbye.

431
00:53:47,852 --> 00:53:49,768
See, a bicycle.

432
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,269
What happened now?

433
00:53:52,435 --> 00:53:54,226
We have to see.

434
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:00,351
Where's my shawl?

435
00:54:02,891 --> 00:54:04,558
Give it here.

436
00:54:11,723 --> 00:54:13,138
What happened?

437
00:54:29,595 --> 00:54:30,969
Shit...

438
00:54:35,594 --> 00:54:37,801
Are you going to leave him on the floor?

439
00:54:52,965 --> 00:54:54,590
What, where? Who is it?

440
00:54:55,382 --> 00:54:56,880
It's Juan.

441
00:54:57,214 --> 00:54:59,047
He won't let us take him home.

442
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,963
"Leave me here, boss..."

443
00:55:03,381 --> 00:55:06,128
Let's leave him here.
He's drunk as a skunk.

444
00:55:07,128 --> 00:55:08,421
Let's go.

445
00:55:08,836 --> 00:55:10,712
Hand me the tarp.

446
00:55:10,878 --> 00:55:12,127
What are you going to do?

447
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,121
What happened?

448
00:55:46,288 --> 00:55:48,995
Some boys entered the farm.

449
00:55:49,162 --> 00:55:51,663
Dagobert shot

450
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:53,704
and released the dogs.

451
00:55:53,869 --> 00:55:56,036
They almost ate one of the boys.

452
00:55:56,495 --> 00:55:59,702
They had to take him to the hospital
in Temuco because he is injured.

453
00:56:00,952 --> 00:56:04,660
They blamed Dagoberto
because he shot him.

454
00:56:05,534 --> 00:56:08,158
He said he only
shot into the air.

455
00:56:08,825 --> 00:56:11,075
But they arrested him anyway.

456
00:56:11,575 --> 00:56:13,074
It's not that serious.

457
00:56:13,242 --> 00:56:15,074
It's easy to resolve this.

458
00:56:15,157 --> 00:56:16,823
What are you going to do?

459
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:18,865
I've already spoken to Nacho.

460
00:56:19,864 --> 00:56:21,366
He will fix it.

461
00:56:22,822 --> 00:56:25,072
Rosita, go to sleep.

462
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,738
Goodnight.

463
00:56:28,821 --> 00:56:30,572
Good evening, Rose.

464
00:56:31,946 --> 00:56:33,779
Can you make me a drink?

465
00:56:37,861 --> 00:56:38,819
Pancho...

466
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:45,151
Why don't we buy
a farm further south?

467
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,734
Pirihueico is so beautiful!

468
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,273
I am tired.

469
00:57:06,855 --> 00:57:08,939
I'm going to sleep, good night.

470
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,595
Idiot!

471
00:58:10,968 --> 00:58:12,219
Run!

472
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:31,548
Patricio, please.

473
00:58:31,714 --> 00:58:35,838
Lock the gate back there.
Who knows what they're going to do.

474
00:58:36,005 --> 00:58:37,172
Thanks.

475
00:58:38,922 --> 00:58:40,754
Dagoberto is on the phone.

476
00:58:43,296 --> 00:58:45,045
Hello? Yes?

477
00:58:46,296 --> 00:58:48,545
No one will fire you.

478
00:58:48,711 --> 00:58:52,378
He's only going to Hualañé for a few days.

479
00:58:53,127 --> 00:58:56,211
He won't say anything until he talks to Nacho.

480
00:58:57,252 --> 00:59:01,585
Hold your tongue, whatever you do.

481
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,667
The problem is yours.

482
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:03,875
Yes. See you later.

483
00:59:08,874 --> 00:59:09,999
Holy crap!

484
00:59:10,165 --> 00:59:11,458
What will happen?

485
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:14,624
Nothing. Dagoberto didn't do anything bad.

486
00:59:14,789 --> 00:59:17,332
That boy shouldn't
have tresspassed.

487
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,747
Dagobert shouldn't have fired either.

488
00:59:53,907 --> 00:59:56,241
-Glad you came.
-Hello.

489
00:59:56,449 --> 00:59:58,199
-All good?
-Good.

490
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:03,030
Where did you get those cool sneakers?

491
01:00:03,198 --> 01:00:04,655
I made them.

492
01:00:04,821 --> 01:00:06,905
It's my designer side.

493
01:00:07,113 --> 01:00:08,779
They are really cool!

494
01:00:11,529 --> 01:00:13,153
Do you like the DJ?

495
01:00:14,529 --> 01:00:17,153
I thought the music would be different.

496
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,027
Lorca likes it, right?

497
01:00:19,612 --> 01:00:21,320
Clearly!

498
01:00:21,527 --> 01:00:23,151
Lorca, are you coming?

499
01:00:41,524 --> 01:00:42,898
A friend of Isi.

500
01:01:36,346 --> 01:01:37,679
What happened?

501
01:01:37,928 --> 01:01:40,512
I sent Dagoberto
to Hualañé.

502
01:01:40,637 --> 01:01:42,387
We need a new guard.

503
01:01:43,554 --> 01:01:45,636
That's why you turned off the TV?

504
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:49,093
Seriously, Pancho.
We can't stay like this.

505
01:01:55,467 --> 01:01:57,050
I want some tea.

506
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,922
Hi, Rose.

507
01:02:10,215 --> 01:02:13,256
Bring two mint teas,
please.

508
01:02:14,423 --> 01:02:15,589
Thanks.

509
01:04:14,023 --> 01:04:16,482
They're waiting downstairs.

510
01:04:17,315 --> 01:04:18,857
I'm not hungry.

511
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:25,565
My head hurts.

512
01:04:28,147 --> 01:04:29,688
Your head hurts.

513
01:04:32,396 --> 01:04:34,563
Pedro brought a gift.

514
01:05:01,391 --> 01:05:05,848
How can he think a girl would
hang that shit in her room?

515
01:05:06,515 --> 01:05:08,472
Pedro is a good boy.

516
01:05:09,223 --> 01:05:10,929
Did you say "good boy"?

517
01:05:11,929 --> 01:05:15,096
Why are you masked?
Like his friends?

518
01:05:15,388 --> 01:05:17,388
He only fights for what is ours.

519
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:20,095
Stirring in the hornets' nest...

520
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:23,635
Instead of finding something
worthwhile.

521
01:05:25,427 --> 01:05:28,593
Moves so much to stay
in the same corral.

522
01:05:30,759 --> 01:05:33,385
It's what I think.

523
01:05:57,463 --> 01:05:59,463
Do you know the Fiskales?

524
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:00,670
No.

525
01:06:00,753 --> 01:06:02,462
The Fiskales Ad-Hok?

526
01:06:03,086 --> 01:06:05,462
A Chilean punk band.

527
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:07,752
No, I do not know.

528
01:06:08,294 --> 01:06:10,751
<i>If you could understand</i>

529
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:15,667
<i>The color of things
It's not what you see</i>

530
01:06:15,834 --> 01:06:18,584
<i>People don't care</i>

531
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:21,041
<i>If you don't have anything to eat</i>

532
01:06:21,209 --> 01:06:23,833
<i>No matter how much I look
to the horizon</i>

533
01:06:23,998 --> 01:06:25,832
<i>I never see what they see</i>

534
01:06:25,998 --> 01:06:28,249
<i>No matter how much I look
to the horizon</i>

535
01:06:28,457 --> 01:06:30,457
<i>If you could understand</i>

536
01:06:30,582 --> 01:06:32,540
<i>If you could understand</i>

537
01:08:22,268 --> 01:08:25,560
These idiots broke in
to René's farm again

538
01:08:25,725 --> 01:08:29,476
and burned two trucks.
There have already been 23 fires.

539
01:08:30,226 --> 01:08:33,183
-Can you believe it?
-They are obsessed with the guy.

540
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:36,475
Do you know who is
behind all this?

541
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,557
The MIR, in front.

542
01:08:38,723 --> 01:08:42,349
All these leftist groups
who now have nothing to do.

543
01:08:42,515 --> 01:08:46,223
They are organizing and
using these idiots.

544
01:08:46,389 --> 01:08:49,013
This has nothing
to do with politics, Nacho.

545
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:51,305
It's an economic issue.

546
01:08:51,472 --> 01:08:52,845
Help me here.

547
01:09:02,428 --> 01:09:04,385
-Sir. Francisco!
-Hey?

548
01:09:04,552 --> 01:09:05,511
Ortiz!

549
01:09:05,676 --> 01:09:08,219
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight. It's good to see you.

550
01:09:08,717 --> 01:09:10,343
-How are you?
-Sir. Francisco.

551
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:12,426
-Lieutenant.
-Don Ignacio.

552
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,133
-My hands are dirty.
-Don't worry.

553
01:09:15,841 --> 01:09:17,882
This is Sub-Lieutenant Díaz.

554
01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:20,092
-Good afternoon.
-Sublieutenant.

555
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:24,006
I wanted to know if you received the subpoena.

556
01:09:24,174 --> 01:09:25,465
Subpoena? No.

557
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,047
I did not receive anything yet.

558
01:09:27,215 --> 01:09:28,671
Subpoena for what?

559
01:09:30,255 --> 01:09:32,046
For the trial,
for what happened.

560
01:09:32,214 --> 01:09:34,837
I didn't receive anything.
When is the trial?

561
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,879
Monday, the 22nd, at 9am.

562
01:09:37,045 --> 01:09:39,586
-Can you go, Nacho?
-I'll be there.

563
01:09:39,753 --> 01:09:41,253
He's my lawyer.

564
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,044
What happened?

565
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:48,252
I already told you. Dagoberto, the dogs,
the boys the other night...

566
01:09:48,793 --> 01:09:51,626
What happens is that
the incident doesn't help us much.

567
01:09:51,793 --> 01:09:53,543
It was an accident.

568
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,084
Choose a more peaceful guard.

569
01:09:57,250 --> 01:10:00,417
Anyway,
I will take care of the boy's family.

570
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:03,291
It is the judge who will decide this.

571
01:10:03,458 --> 01:10:05,998
I'm not bothered
by what the judge says.

572
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:08,540
-It's you who knows.
-I know.

573
01:10:11,372 --> 01:10:13,996
We have to go. Excuse me.

574
01:10:14,164 --> 01:10:15,289
Goodnight.

575
01:10:16,122 --> 01:10:19,205
Be careful with the dogs.
They're tied up.

576
01:10:19,371 --> 01:10:24,370
Only Samson could be free.
Just kick him in the nose.

577
01:10:25,036 --> 01:10:26,079
It's better that way.

578
01:10:26,162 --> 01:10:28,079
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

579
01:10:28,453 --> 01:10:31,411
Pick up the soda along the way.

580
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:45,492
-What were you thinking, Pancho?
-What it was?

581
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,032
If you get in trouble,

582
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,199
the police will be the only ones
that will help you.

583
01:10:51,365 --> 01:10:52,614
You are right.

584
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:54,281
You are very arrogant.

585
01:10:54,448 --> 01:10:57,780
He was telling me
how to pick my workers!

586
01:10:57,946 --> 01:11:00,654
No, I had to stop them.

587
01:11:01,613 --> 01:11:03,862
You would have done the same.

588
01:11:03,945 --> 01:11:04,820
Or worse!

589
01:11:04,987 --> 01:11:08,321
-I would have sent them to Patagonia!
-They saw?

590
01:12:49,176 --> 01:12:50,384
Perfect.

591
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:53,051
It's the right depth
for an ultrasound.

592
01:12:54,924 --> 01:12:58,133
-What is the range?
-Thirty meters.

593
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:33,875
Nice gift...

594
01:14:05,577 --> 01:14:07,494
-Here he is.
-Leave him there.

595
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:10,327
-Leave him here?
-AND.

596
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:24,241
I'm not going to use ultrasound.

597
01:14:25,158 --> 01:14:26,573
It is not enough.

598
01:14:26,698 --> 01:14:29,157
-Hello.
-Hello, Mane.

599
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:32,073
-Do you want to go and have dinner?
-No, I'm fine with this.

600
01:14:32,613 --> 01:14:35,406
How many eggs does a carp lay?

601
01:14:36,863 --> 01:14:38,156
A million.

602
01:14:39,987 --> 01:14:41,695
I'll use rotenone.

603
01:14:41,862 --> 01:14:44,112
Rotenone is toxic.

604
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,112
Carp are even worse!

605
01:14:46,986 --> 01:14:48,445
You are crazy!

606
01:14:49,736 --> 01:14:51,319
You have some problem!

607
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:53,153
What's the matter with you, Mane?

608
01:14:53,651 --> 01:14:56,110
I'm fed up.
Dad is obsessed, Mom!

609
01:14:56,235 --> 01:14:59,151
Don't talk to your father like that.
He adores you.

610
01:15:00,192 --> 01:15:02,899
-What about you?
-Not me.

611
01:15:03,691 --> 01:15:05,898
-Does he adore you?
-Who?

612
01:15:06,316 --> 01:15:07,442
Daddy.

613
01:15:13,357 --> 01:15:16,148
Not enough for me to
invite you to New York.

614
01:15:18,896 --> 01:15:21,646
I do not want to go. Go you.

615
01:16:30,882 --> 01:16:32,050
Shit...

616
01:16:43,048 --> 01:16:44,839
Let's Dance. One two three.

617
01:16:45,006 --> 01:16:46,131
Dance!

618
01:16:49,962 --> 01:16:52,462
One, two, three, stop!

619
01:18:26,777 --> 01:18:30,069
What an idea to burn
Dagoberto's house!

620
01:18:31,526 --> 01:18:32,901
They are already here.

621
01:18:42,732 --> 01:18:44,565
Park there.

622
01:18:47,481 --> 01:18:49,690
Come on, some more.

623
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:55,563
That.

624
01:19:09,062 --> 01:19:10,061
It is good.

625
01:19:12,436 --> 01:19:14,019
DANGER

626
01:19:25,474 --> 01:19:26,808
What happened?

627
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,350
A man died.

628
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:31,765
Apparently because
of police officers.

629
01:19:31,974 --> 01:19:33,847
The policemen?

630
01:19:45,222 --> 01:19:47,262
Hey, come here.

631
01:19:50,012 --> 01:19:50,928
Mane!

632
01:19:51,928 --> 01:19:53,220
Mane, come here.

633
01:19:55,885 --> 01:19:56,718
Mane!

634
01:20:30,462 --> 01:20:31,544
Mane!

635
01:20:33,503 --> 01:20:34,795
Mane, come back!

636
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:40,669
Mane, come back!

637
01:20:44,002 --> 01:20:45,168
Mane!

638
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,084
Mane!

639
01:22:18,513 --> 01:22:22,578
