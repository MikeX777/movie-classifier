Mireille!

23
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,390
Do you need a ride?

24
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,390
No, thanks, some other time.

25
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,250
Don't you realize
you're wasting your time?

26
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,420
Can't you see that this poor child
is in love with a homegrown Don Juan?

27
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,230
- I ran away from everyone.
- Good for you.

28
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,580
Okay, now let's go
to my parents' house.

29
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,160
Doesn't it bother you?
- Of course not. It's just, uh.

30
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,160
Since I've been hesitant
to introduce you to my own,

31
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,880
it's like playing tennis
with one racket.

32
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,460
- We're engaged.
- We are engaged.

33
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,700
But telling your parents about it
that's a whole other thing.

34
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,480
It's an empty formality.
I'm for tradition.

35
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,870
So did my mother.

36
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,870
The problem is,
you don't have the same ones.

37
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,390
All right. All in good time.
Let's go!

38
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,590
Paul!

39
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,060
You guys are so touching!

40
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,930
Maybe for a change,
leave us alone?

41
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,930
We look at you and envy you!

42
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,900
May you have
our best wishes!

43
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,360
- Did you find it?
- There's a strange sound.

44
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,710
Are you okay?

45
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,150
It's okay.

46
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,020
Yeah, man,
you really nailed it!

47
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,020
- А...
- Ooh-la-la-la!

48
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,020
They can't be left alone
not even for five minutes.

49
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,430
This is not a good time!

50
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:08,330
Don't get so worked up, old man!

51
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,950
Ouch, he's hurt!
- No, he's not!

52
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,950
- Yes, yes! You're hurt!
- We need to call an ambulance!

53
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,500
Stay out of this!

54
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,990
Relax, man,
we'll take care of everything.

55
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,200
I'll call the fire department,
it can't get any worse!

56
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,590
Come on!
Meet you guys here!

57
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,970
Get out of the car!

58
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,070
Pass me
some kind of instrument.

59
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,070
Thank you.

60
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,350
The distance between
between the witnesses is two meters.

61
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,980
And the names of the daredevil's children.
Maurice, Etienne, Micheline.

62
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,360
А!

63
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,680
Mr. Policeman,

64
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,220
you'll save valuable time
if you use this notebook.

65
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,220
Is that it? Thank you.

66
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,250
- Mariel, can you do us a favor?
- That's all I know how to do!

67
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,170
Here, here's my papers,
make a deal with the cops.

68
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,580
- We have a very important meeting!
- You can count on me.

69
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,580
Here's the proof.

70
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,530
I don't like the way
this case is taking.

71
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,530
- Have we disturbed too many people?
- We gotta get outta here!

72
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,000
Guys, save yourselves!

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,460
А! The final touch!

74
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,930
Any witnesses?

75
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,740
Я!

76
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,740
Я!

77
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,640
- So there was no one in the car?
- Well, I didn't see anything, foreman.

78
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,070
- Make me a report.
- A report?

79
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,740
- Well, you've seen the daisies, haven't you?
- Well, uh.

80
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,100
Where are we meeting
with Mireille and her challenger?

81
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,760
In "Bin'se."

82
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,020
- At Bin's?
- It's in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

83
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,070
О!

84
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,060
Oh, no, no, no. I decidedly
do not like your new hat!

85
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,760
It's a fashion.

86
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,060
BANANA DAY

87
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,670
Here you go.

88
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,860
- How's it going, Mr. Duchemin?
- Slowly.

89
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,990
The baby's been
a big help, huh?

90
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,680
Mr. Martin!

91
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,440
You have good taste.

92
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,880
What do you think of my
new car?

93
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,880
No good, Mr. Viviani.
It's no good!

94
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,670
Your cars! Your cars!

95
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,670
Do you know what you're doing
with your cars?

96
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,480
You're making our little square
little square,

97
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,170
that was once
pleasant and peaceful.

98
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,270
Come on, Marguerite.

99
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,320
We need laws
that prohibit it!

100
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Yes, yes, laws! Laws!

101
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,010
And progress?
Where will he put progress?!

102
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,310
Wait, let's ask here.
Excuse me, sir. А!

103
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,430
- It's Bean's!
- Thank you.

104
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,110
Looks like a basement.

105
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,960
I introduced you to my
at the Peace Café.

106
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,880
I often wonder, Marguerite,
if we haven't given our daughter

107
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,420
too much freedom?

108
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,130
Let's go downstairs after all.

109
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,680
We'll see.

110
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,400
- Is there a fire?
- No, monsieur, it's all right.

111
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,710
Come on, let's go.

112
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,560
My parents.

113
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:45,800
Where?

114
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,590
Hi!

115
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,900
It's Dad.

116
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,090
Mom.
And this is Paul.

117
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,760
He usually looks better, but today.
we had transportation problems.

118
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,200
Please.

119
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,240
Sit down, Leon.

120
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,040
Scotch tape?

121
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,320
Make it scotch.

122
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,290
Daddy, Mommy!

123
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,290
I'm so glad you came!
Do you like them?

124
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,290
- Mireille, listen.
- Very much!

125
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,050
- That's very nice.
- Very nice!

126
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,760
Paul and I love each other.

127
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
You're not the one who should be talking,
Mireille!

128
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,180
We love each other, madam.

129
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,600
I presume, monsieur, that
your parents know?

130
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,520
To be completely honest...

131
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,980
We're going to Paul's parents
as soon as we've made arrangements with you.

132
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,760
We're not supposed to organize
to organize?!

133
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,760
My parents
are almost impossible to see.

134
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,600
They're so original. They only accept
only some of the old bosses

135
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,860
at his estate in Solonie.

136
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,500
That's the kind of invitations they have.

137
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,880
- I'm sorry.
- Don't look for your glasses, Dad, I'll read it.

138
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,850
"Monsieur and Madame de Granlew
request to do the honors."

139
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,470
"to come shoot paws
in their La Renee forest."

140
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,470
"October 30th of this year."

141
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,510
It's in a month!
Okay, we'll be there.

142
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,720
Let me do that.

143
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,260
But this invitation is addressed
to the Count and Countess de Mericourt!

144
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,250
No, it's ours. Especially
since the invention of the proofreader.

145
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,010
Mireille! You'll have to excuse her.

146
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,510
Mireille had
an amazing idea!

147
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,510
All three of you will come to the castle!

148
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,210
- Is that a castle?
- Oh, it's small.

149
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,680
It's a done deal.
Do you have a car?

150
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,470
А... Uh, no. We don't have a car.

151
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,270
Is it shameful to come by train
- is shameful?

152
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,730
No, but you have to make
three transfers.

153
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,000
We're used to
to take the subway.

154
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,810
You have to come!

155
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:45,050
Would you tell me, young man,
what this means:

156
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,350
"shoot your paws"?

157
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,230
Daddy, I'll explain everything to you.
Everything's gonna work out just fine.

158
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,910
The key is to participate in the hunt.

159
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,400
Yeah, and then I'll tell you all about it.

160
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,970
Here, Dad, here's your invitation.

161
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,780
But it's the only way
to meet his parents.

162
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,240
You're welcome!

163
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
No, no, I won't allow it.

164
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,620
I won't let you...

165
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,650
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

166
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,270
It's cool here, huh?

167
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,930
Yeah, cool.

168
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,630
The young man is charming.
I'm sure he loves Mireille.

169
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,120
But I have a feeling
something's bothering him.

170
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,990
He drives a luxury car,
Mireille takes the subway.

171
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,570
They weren't supposed to meet,
is what I'm saying. Let's go!

172
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,290
So we're not going
"paw hunting"?

173
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,660
What paws?
А! Paws.

174
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,950
Be reasonable, we don't even
don't even know what they are, paws.

175
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,380
Too bad, I would have loved it.

176
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,000
First of all, we don't have a car.

177
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,330
Secondly, an invitation
in the name of Count de Mericourt.

178
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,140
Oh, by the way, I'll have
send him his invitation.

179
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,260
To the Count.

180
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,510
Another new car?

181
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,140
There's a lot of dust
in new cars!

182
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,900
You'd better clean the stairs!

183
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,300
What's it to you?
You live on the first floor!

184
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,400
Do I have the right to take care
my car or not?!

185
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,150
Your car?

186
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,650
Look at the sign,
if you don't believe me.

187
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,020
Alice Lambeg, concierge.

188
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,010
Mrs. Lambeg, I may be old-fashioned,
but something eludes me.

189
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,860
What do you need it for,
this automobile?

190
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,580
I'll make escapades,
from time to time.

191
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,400
We can barely see you.

192
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
We ordered it four and a half years ago.

193
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
We asked you to come
to meet our needs,

194
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,910
but when you're the concierge,
you obviously don't have priority.

195
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,300
Well, well, well.

196
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,590
It's a nice gray color.
- Obviously, it's not a luxury.

197
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,310
But when you get behind the wheel,
you're speechless.

198
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,300
What are you waiting for,
Mr. Martin?

199
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,630
Except for you Marines
in the house.

200
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,800
We're thinking about it.
- You see, Mr. Martin,

201
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,200
there are times in life
when you have to come out of your hole.

202
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
I like it in my hole,
Mrs. Lambeg.

203
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,200
That's what they all say. And then when they come out,
they're very happy.

204
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,650
Have you seen my
anti-theft device?!

205
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,430
Goes from the steering wheel straight
to the janitor's closet.

206
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,770
It's for the night!

207
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,650
Infantryman!
I don't care about the Marine.

208
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,180
Well, Leon, are you coming?

209
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,900
What are you doing in there?

210
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,410
Do we have a proofreader at home?

211
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,030
An invitation:
for Mr. and Mrs. Martin.

212
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,020
Grunlew, Grunlew...

213
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,250
But it's the same one
who commanded the Hussars at Tulier!

214
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,250
Maybe. We don't know.

215
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,250
We are invited and...

216
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,120
of course, they're not
they're not very close to us.

217
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,770
Yes, colossi!
Pillars of their generation!

218
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,060
Maybe it is.

219
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,220
So, Guillard?

220
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,690
What have you decided?

221
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,700
We live about 50 meters
from each other. I agree.

222
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,090
We're old friends.
I agree.

223
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,900
But I won't lend you a dime
to buy a car!

224
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
No, no, and no!

225
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,900
How could it be, Leon!

226
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,360
We swore we'd be the two
the last two pedestrians of Paris!

227
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,690
Eh, my dear,

228
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,500
I understand why
you don't understand me.

229
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,190
You don't have a daughter.

230
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,790
If you'd been to Bin's....

231
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,600
- At Bin's?
- Yes, at Bin's, at Bin's.

232
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,400
in a smoke-filled closet,

233
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,350
where young men and women
drinking scotch,

234
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,130
by putting mercury and chromium
mercury and chromium,

235
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,460
maybe something would change
something different.

236
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,730
You'd think, perhaps,

237
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,590
that you're an old monkey
clinging to a dried-up branch.

238
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,550
- Definitely not!
- A kind gesture, commander!

239
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,770
There's no way we're going
to this hunt in a cab?!

240
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,570
Instead of borrowing money,
I'd rather borrow a car.

241
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:28,180
Everybody's got one now.
- Why don't we just steal it?

242
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,420
There's still an opportunity.
- Bravo! Don't count on me!

243
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,420
We're already funding
a sailing nursery.

244
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,590
Hélène!

245
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,410
Enough of your silly fantasies!

246
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,290
And do me a favor,
take off that hat!

247
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,290
You look like a jellyfish!

248
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,650
Now it's time for me to go to bed.

249
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,430
Good night!
- Good night.

250
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,490
Dad, don't think about the car anymore!
Don't start!

251
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,410
But we have to find a way
to find 300,000 francs,

252
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,410
without having to get off
from the honest road!

253
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,980
Damn it!

254
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,860
I'm reminded of that
of your epic cancan from 1922.

255
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,230
Ellen, I've had enough
with your cancan!

256
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,230
And I'm fed up with cars!

257
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,600
Get in!

258
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,410
And don't touch me!

259
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,370
CAULIFLOWER DAY

260
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:52,810
- Straight?
- I'll tell you right now.

261
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,810
Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.

262
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,420
So, what, every day.
a new idea?

263
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,820
Ah, it's done! Only thing is.
the supplier is late with the goods.

264
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,120
Dear Friend. If you had
your own truck,

265
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,170
if you were calm.

266
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,020
Nowadays, anyone who doesn't have his own car
looks like a poor relative.

267
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,250
Especially at ceremonies.

268
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,240
- You don't have one either.
- Yes, I do! I'll buy one the other day.

269
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,430
Just yesterday you were against it.

270
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,760
Mr. Viviani!

271
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,750
I'm against people who have a car
who don't need one!

272
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,750
You don't have a daughter!
- But I have four sons!

273
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,780
There's no connection!

274
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,040
Boys should be brought up
in a strict, Spartan way!

275
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,930
By bus!

276
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,930
- And what do you buy?
- Well, I buy, uh... uh...

277
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,110
I'm not sure yet.
I want a car that

278
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:32,610
would have an effect,
but not too conspicuous.

279
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,020
It's for hunting.

280
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,730
Hunt!

281
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,730
Wow!

282
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,870
Is he bragging or something?

283
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,360
Enterprises Robiche & Co.
FUNERAL HOME

284
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,120
Try your luck!

285
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,570
There's a raffle tonight!
Try your luck!

286
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,570
There's a raffle tonight!

287
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,790
Try your luck!

288
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,300
There's a raffle tonight!
A ticket, monsieur?

289
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,460
That's the one!

290
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,270
- You make me laugh!
- Then laugh!

291
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,030
On Via Piccardi.
we start together, from the bottom.

292
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,420
You with your Marilyn,
me with my "Rita."

293
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,070
We're not even on the freeway yet,
and you're already three blocks behind.

294
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,830
Full tank or empty?
- It doesn't depend.

295
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,520
- We'll see about that.
- We already did.

296
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,260
Hello, gentlemen.
Have you seen the deputy director?

297
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,000
It's gotta be hanging out there somewhere.

298
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Imagine this,
I'm gonna ask him for an advance.

299
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,900
- Is that so?
- It's pretty big.

300
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,530
Yes! Yesterday, I crawled out
out of my hole.

301
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,130
Success is like money.
you get it right away.

302
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,560
If you hesitate,
it won't work.

303
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,560
And I'll tell the chief this:

304
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,740
Monsieur!

305
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,990
There he is.

306
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,980
You're the lucky one.

307
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,400
He doesn't seem to be in
not in a bad mood today.

308
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,180
Well, I'll be off.

309
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,060
I'll bet you an aperitif
that he won't make up his mind?

310
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,390
bookkeeper martan city

311
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,390
Get out!

312
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,020
"All the details about the varieties
of the models on display at the Salon!"

313
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,390
Ask for "Salon Magazine!"

314
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,120
Thank you, monsieur.

315
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,590
I'm sure they'll tell the whole neighborhood
that we're going to the Salon. That's ridiculous.

316
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,940
So what? It's forbidden?

317
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,250
And why would we even choose a car
if we don't have the money?

318
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,410
We're going to see,
just to see!

319
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,100
I don't want to decide blindly.

320
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,250
I'm not going to Grunle's
in the first car I see!

321
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,740
You know me.
- All right, let's go. It's gonna be crowded.

322
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,900
No, it's empty at noon.
People are eating lunch.

323
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,900
The French are maniacs.
At noon, they eat lunch.

324
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,210
Isn't that right?

325
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,300
At noon, the French have lunch.

326
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,450
Nobody's hungry, it seems!
- I'm sick of you.

327
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,980
It's probably all foreigners.

328
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,980
You hired guns!
Get a move on!

329
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,670
43rd CAR SALON.

330
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,620
- Unbelievable!
- Are you interested?

331
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,810
Yeah, I mean, I'd like
to take a look at the car.

332
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:31,900
She's behind you.

333
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,430
Oh, yeah, I can see her antenna
her antenna!

334
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,800
No, ma'am, no.

335
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,020
Personally, I see a rider on the roof
and the windshield, a horsewoman.

336
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,040
Let's not discuss it.
I like it, I'll take it.

337
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,110
Put it aside for me.
I'm waiting for the money to come in.

338
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,100
Are you crazy?!

339
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,740
Okay, I'm signing you up.
Delivery's in six months.

340
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,120
Is this a joke? We're invited to shoot
at the bumps. uh, paws at the end of the month.

341
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,120
Monsieur, my daughter's happiness
my daughter's happiness depends on this day.

342
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,000
If she doesn't get married,
you're not the one who's going to comfort her!

343
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,310
I don't know about that,
I'd have to look at it.

344
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,310
I need this car
October 30th.

345
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,160
Well, you'll have an order ticket in your pocket
an order ticket!

346
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,330
Don't make fun of me.

347
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,930
How do you want me to drive
around Solonie with an order ticket?

348
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,420
Monsieur, for all production cars.
there is a delivery time.

349
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,720
Here. Here you go.

350
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,260
But monsieur!

351
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,610
Leon!

352
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:21,940
We could look at that one over there.
There's no one around it.

353
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,480
Luxury cars scare people.

354
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
She must be very expensive.

355
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,850
Shall we go take a look?

356
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,300
What are we risking?

357
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,220
- What's that?
- Some kind of defense.

358
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,940
It's kind of like a restroom in there.
- Wow, that's fun to look at.

359
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,190
- Don't touch it!
- I'm not touching anything!

360
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,730
It's like a telephone.
- And up there, look up there!

361
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,430
She's a beauty, isn't she?

362
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,210
We're here.

363
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,500
We'd like to inquire...
to know the price.

364
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,070
Oh, but there's a little bar inside!
And a smoking area.

365
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:24,590
We already have an apartment.
We're looking for a car...

366
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,040
But there it is!

367
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,950
Go, go, go!

368
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,780
Wait a minute, you can't inspect a car like this
you can't take a quick look at a car like this!

369
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,130
People visit it. Like a museum!

370
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,950
- We don't want to disturb you.
- No, no, come in. Come in, ma'am!

371
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,610
Come in, monsieur.

372
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,320
- That's it.
- Move over.

373
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,610
Yeah, yeah, I'm moving. Here, there's a spot.

374
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,250
Come on, move, move!

375
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,740
- It's very comfortable!
- What a boring gentleman!

376
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,490
It's a runaway model.

377
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,490
The Archbishop of Canterbury
bought one just like it.

378
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,790
With a Prayer Book to go along with it.

379
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,800
Tell the Archbishop that, uh.
I'm sorry, but at the end of the day.

380
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,100
Look, you're a businessman,
I'm guessing,

381
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,770
you can work
right in the car!

382
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,770
Basically, you'll be able to
save money!

383
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,770
And if you're a father of a family--

384
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:10,710
you can entertain your children.
See?

385
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,520
This fantasy is not in the car
of the archbishop, obviously.

386
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,350
And finally!
Finally, safety!

387
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,400
Look!

388
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,080
It's a useless precaution, because
there are no accidents with this car!

389
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,760
It's funny.

390
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,980
It's very easy to open,
you're about to see.

391
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,330
It's childishly simple:
you click here.

392
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,180
at...

393
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
And then you...

394
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,850
What's the matter? Oh, you fuck!

395
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,540
Oh, come on. I mean, come on.

396
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,420
Hold on, I'll go get help!

397
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,420
In the meantime.
read this.

398
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,040
Very curious.

399
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,830
See you soon!

400
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,160
Thank you, ma'am.

401
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,770
So, how was the salon?

402
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,250
Overrated.

403
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,100
Or cars,
that can be paid for outright,

404
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,540
but we have to wait three years,

405
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,540
or cars,
that can be picked up right away,

406
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,170
but which cannot be
to pay for.

407
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,170
Good evening.

408
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,550
So, how was the salon?

409
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,550
Amazing! Wonderful!

410
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,550
Have a nice day.

411
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,160
Well? How's the salon?

412
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,900
Well, that's too much!

413
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,590
The concierge is in possession
in 2 horsepower.

414
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,520
"And finally, the number 17201

415
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,600
won 40 million in Group 4."

416
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,380
"These were the results
of the National Lottery draw."

417
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,450
And now on the program.
light music.

418
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,250
No one ever wins!

419
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,250
Was it worth it
to count on!

420
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,610
I had a little bit of an idea.
In fact, I almost got it.

421
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:59,210
Would 2 more digits...
2 more digits in another series.....

422
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,400
and I would have won.

423
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,340
Look, I've been thinking about
what you said this morning.

424
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,420
Yeah, I need a truck!

425
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,080
Here, for example, listen to this!

426
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,300
Used car dealership
is selling a flatbed truck.

427
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,150
The sides are very convenient
for vegetables.

428
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,660
A rare find!
Impeccably "savvy".

429
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,660
185,000 kilometers.

430
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,400
185,000?

431
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,090
Yeah, 185,000.

432
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,330
Well, it's used.
Of course it is!

433
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,650
But they wrote
"rare opportunity."

434
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,650
I have no reason
to doubt it.

435
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:28,130
Well, some garages
they're twisting the meter.

436
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,840
Might as well add to it.

437
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,100
Do you have the amount of money
do you have the money you need?

438
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,670
Let's find it.

439
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,400
- I'm a little short.
- I have a loan.

440
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,150
There's a loan.

441
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,090
Two wheels to pay,
two wheels not to pay.

442
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,850
It's gonna feel like
like you're driving sideways and sideways.

443
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,750
Good night, Mr. Duchemin,
I'm going to bed.

444
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,120
Good night, Mr. Martin.

445
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,800
- Yes?
- Can I come in?

446
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,020
Uh, sure.

447
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,550
Working?

448
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,490
Uh, yeah.

449
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,770
Good for you.

450
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,340
Serious.

451
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,360
"Pharmaco-dynamics."

452
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:17,990
It's the study of the effects
of drugs on the body.

453
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,430
How much you know!

454
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,360
Listen, Mireille,

455
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,710
I was thinking about the car.

456
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,390
We need to find a way to make money,
you know, more money than usual.

457
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,830
Oh, Dad.

458
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,830
I don't want you
I don't want you to feel that way.

459
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:39,830
I don't want you to change your life
to change your life for me.

460
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,830
Don't be selfish, daughter!

461
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,430
If this hunt
you won't be proud of us,

462
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,600
the most unfortunate ones
will be your mother and me.

463
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,260
And then...

464
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,640
to rise in respect
for yourself,

465
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,600
I need this car
this car.

466
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,420
Then tomorrow I'll ask the faculty
from the guys on the faculty.

467
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,130
Go to bed, Daddy.

468
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,060
It's not heavy,
but it's very cumbersome.

469
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,310
Keep the change.

470
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,310
But it's missing
20 francs!

471
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,310
Didn't anyone ever tell you
that students need to be helped?!

472
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,730
- Poor France!
- I think I'll go.

473
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,580
- Shame on you!
- There they are.

474
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,600
Papa Martan won't know
how to thank us!

475
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,220
Yeah, it's not every semester
we get ideas like this!

476
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,960
Mr. Martin, today is
is your lucky day!

477
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,250
- Our respects, Mrs. Martin!
- Thank you.

478
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,400
They're great!

479
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,910
- Hello, monsieur!
- No, we're just being nice.

480
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,880
Mr. Martin, we've brought you
a gold mine for you!

481
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,900
It's Surditos!

482
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,800
What's that?

483
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,010
Deaf apparatus.

484
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,010
The invention of the Gazansky Father.

485
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,280
We brought 50. You'll sell them
for 10,000 francs apiece,

486
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,860
you each get 5 grand.

487
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,290
Mr. Martin!

488
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,530
Your profit for everything -
250 grand!

489
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,530
Who am I supposed to sell
these machines?

490
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,120
Make yourself a list
and get to work.

491
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,120
Mireille, we're gonna need to release
the package.

492
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,620
But wait a minute,
I haven't said yes yet!

493
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,620
I'm not cut out for trading!

494
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,450
I'll even be cheated
to buy blue Galloises.

495
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,350
The trade, Mr. Martin.
is that

496
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:28,750
to let you fool yourself
on the purchase and then get revenge.

497
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,070
Léon, don't forget that your father was
the first gossip of Dijon.

498
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,760
Maybe it's hereditary.
will manifest itself?

499
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,610
Well, I'd be surprised.

500
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,830
The goods have been delivered!

501
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,210
Don't forget, Mr. Martin,
we are your guardian angels!

502
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,600
Thank you.
Goodbye, gentlemen.

503
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,980
And all of this
to buy a car!

504
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,180
How stupid to be poor,
Oh, my God!

505
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,410
Yeah, well, uh.

506
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,920
Here we go.

507
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,370
It looks pretty complicated.

508
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,720
In my youth.
the same result was achieved

509
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,120
with a simple horn.

510
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,990
- There should be a manual.
- Here it is.

511
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,800
It's Polish.

512
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:37,680
I have a college degree,
but I don't read Polish.

513
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,010
Give me a hand here.

514
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,850
Give me your ear.

515
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,270
- Don't hurt me!
- Oh, don't worry.

516
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,740
Shut the other one up.

517
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,480
Hey!

518
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,880
Hey!

519
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,210
Do you hear anything?

520
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,400
Do you hear anything?

521
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,610
I can't hear anything!

522
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,920
That's not good.

523
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,880
How about this?

524
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,880
I hear a slight crackle!

525
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,060
For a deaf person, it's a joy,
a slight crackle!

526
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:20,110
Who to sell to first?

527
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,110
If you ask
a lot of questions, you'll get confused!

528
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:24,260
The day of my first communion.
you were behind the counter with the nuns,

529
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,580
and you sold everything.

530
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,580
It's true, isn't it?

531
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,390
A whole counter full of lace circles,
completely useless!

532
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,700
Or maybe I have a gift.

533
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,870
I'm gonna go drop off one of those Surditos
to Duchemin.

534
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,370
But he's not deaf!

535
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,590
Margarita, don't make it harder for me
with all those statements.

536
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,590
Okay, right? I'll see you soon.

537
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,000
- Mr. Duchemin!
- I'm coming, I'm coming! I'm not deaf!

538
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,020
Weigh this for me.

539
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,400
- Hello!
- Hello, Mr. Martin!

540
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,750
Do you have a couple minutes?

541
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,750
- Actually, I'm just, uh.
- It's important.

542
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,060
Okay, I'll be at your service in a minute.
Wait for me at the store.

543
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,290
Oh, that's great.

544
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,940
Everything all right?

545
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,490
Look!

546
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,590
Thank you, ma'am.

547
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,320
What the hell is that?

548
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,150
Impressive, huh?

549
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,370
But...

550
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,290
what's that for?

551
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,470
It's for people who are
a little tight on the ears.

552
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,470
Yeah, but the baby.

553
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,330
For now, he does hear well.
But in a month, in a year.

554
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,510
can you say
that this child will not suddenly

555
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,480
deaf as a post?
- No, but, uh.

556
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,330
You see, you have to think
about the future, Mr. Duchemin.

557
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:55,290
Yes?

558
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,630
Hide this machine
in the closet,

559
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,490
and if ever
your baby goes deaf.

560
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,490
he'll be so happy
to find him!

561
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,950
Just one kind gesture.

562
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,080
For a baby,
not very spoiled!

563
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,700
- How's that?
- No, he's not spoiled.

564
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,980
With your worries, with your trade...
He's not spoiled, here.

565
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,920
Not spoiled, admittedly!
Not spoiled.

566
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,590
He's having fun with Surditos.
- Do you think that, uh.

567
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:19,020
You can devote 12,000 francs
francs to the happiness of this child, can't you?

568
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,910
Think about the future,
one more time.

569
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,950
You've been told the future is nobody's.
Well, it's not! The future.

570
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,330
When he sold lace to the nuns,
it was his kindness that helped him. But here.

571
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,330
I'm afraid it's going to be a little more complicated than that.

572
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,820
But he looks
quite happy.

573
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,760
Are you happy?

574
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,640
He's happy. He's fine.

575
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,980
Thank you.
There was no rush.

576
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,690
Do we put him in a box
or should we leave him like that?

577
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:56,940
I don't care.
We can leave it to him for now.

578
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,940
Okay, all right. Goodbye!

579
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,900
Yes, the instructions are in the box.

580
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,010
I'll note that it's in Polish.
But since that's for later...

581
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,330
We'll have time
to learn Polish.

582
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,330
FERNANDEL
Seneschal the Magnificent

583
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,490
You're not interested in souvenirs?

584
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,820
Not today.

585
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,200
Oh, shit! Fine.

586
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:30,510
I see you're not interested
you're not interested in souvenirs either.

587
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,050
Please stop nagging.

588
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,050
I haven't told my parents
to my parents yet,

589
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,770
but I already hinted at it.
I'm making them.

590
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,190
You're ashamed of me!

591
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,490
Mireille!

592
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,660
Mireille!
- But that's what it looks like.

593
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,970
Dad's been going out of his way
about this hunt.

594
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,140
We'll show up at your place, but no one
will know who we are.

595
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,310
Please!

596
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,500
Let's go.

597
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
See also.

598
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,960
Ah, these are friends of my parents.
If they see me, it's for an hour.

599
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,770
Could you let me through,
please?

600
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,440
Monsieur, you are on the sidewalk.

601
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,360
And the sidewalks belong
to the pedestrians.

602
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,460
Well, not this one.

603
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,080
Now what, there are
different categories of sidewalks?!

604
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,540
Where are we going?
- Monsieur,

605
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,850
when my husband, in 1918.
marched in a parade,

606
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,850
he was on the highway!
- Ellen,

607
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,210
you know that in November, 1918.
I was in bed with the mumps.

608
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,400
Oh, come on, come on.

609
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,700
Oh, come on,
make a kind gesture!

610
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,030
The highway is for cars,
the sidewalk is for pedestrians!

611
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,570
- I'm warning you, I'm going.
- Here!

612
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,710
They're friends of my parents.

613
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,230
All right, for your pleasure.
I'm only gonna try to hit one.

614
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,860
You're so beautiful. The most
the prettiest girl on the Champs Elysees.

615
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,230
What about other places?

616
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,700
- And we're not going that way.
- Oh, don't touch me!

617
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,420
Take me to the station!

618
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,420
Come on, come on in quietly.

619
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,950
I want to go to the station!
Is that my right?!

620
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,690
I don't have a lot of rights
I have left.

621
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:07,380
I expect
to elevate the precinct

622
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,300
the tortured voice
of the last pedestrian in Paris!

623
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,880
Your humble servant,
gentlemen. Let's go!

624
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,220
You'll see, it's gonna
will change your life!

625
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,090
Well, we didn't complain much,
Mr. Martin.

626
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,000
Thank you.

627
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,850
In America now.
everyone's wearing Sourdittos!

628
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,800
Mr. Martin!

629
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,540
Mr. Surditos.
oh, Mr. Deputy Director!

630
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,160
Trading
during business hours?

631
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,790
- Yeah.
- In my office now!

632
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,840
So,

633
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,140
is that her?
- Yes, it is.

634
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,020
And this time, I have to say,
I was very lucky!

635
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,020
It's the highest grade!

636
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,400
You're about to hear
that sound!

637
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:42,000
With a motor like this.
you'll never be bored!

638
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,770
That's because
I didn't warm it up.

639
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,220
Yeah, I let it cool down,

640
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,900
because when it was heated up.
it was smoking.

641
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,620
The smoke, of course,
it's not that significant,

642
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,100
didn't interfere with the steering at all.

643
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,230
Tell me, Mr. Duchemin,

644
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:59,850
I have to take
my driver's test.

645
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,710
Here I was thinking that, uh.

646
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,040
Here, Mr. Deputy Director, this is what you wanted
you wanted to give your mother.

647
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,480
Thank you.

648
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,830
We're having the wrong October.

649
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,470
I had nothing to do with it!
What do these two receipts mean?

650
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,300
Auguste put
a second carburetor on the Rita,

651
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,300
and Robert is the second compressor
on the Marilyn?

652
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,890
Up until now, our cars
have had ordinary performance!

653
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,870
I'll take care of it, Mr. Deputy Director.
See you soon, goodbye.

654
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,700
- It's not hard at all!
- Yes, it is.

655
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,560
We'll have to do more
to improve.

656
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,910
It's Robert's fault.

657
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,410
You keep saying
that my "Rita" is hot.

658
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,040
I've got a boosted engine!

659
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,480
Otherwise it's just an ordinary car.
And it's supposed to give fire!

660
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,160
That's what this is for!

661
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,420
All right. Uh-huh.

662
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:49,230
I'll see what I can do.

663
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,320
Oh, thank you, Mr. Martin,
thank you, thank you!

664
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,400
You can count on us
if you need a favor in return.

665
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,840
Yeah, here's the thing, by the way.

666
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,380
I have to take my driver's license
for my driver's license.

667
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,180
Here I was thinking that, uh.

668
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,130
- You have to go straight.
- I'm going straight, aren't I?

669
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,260
- Brake, brake!
- I can't find the brake...

670
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,930
- Brake in the middle! In the middle!
- I can't find it!

671
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,230
Oh, I found it!

672
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,340
Let me do it myself!

673
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,910
Stupid!

674
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,910
That's my wife.

675
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,920
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I feel like I'm making progress already!

676
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,870
Hey! Watch out! Watch out!

677
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,480
Watch out!

678
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,980
О! You're gonna pay me
for the oranges! You!

679
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,720
Don't worry, darling.
I'll take half a kilo from you.

680
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,720
Half a kilo?! What nerve!

681
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,120
Come on, pay up, don't argue!

682
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,960
Pay up, pay up.
You're so funny! Pay up!

683
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,090
50, 60... 80...

684
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,030
100... and so on...

685
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,030
I stop...

686
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,560
Letting off the gas.

687
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,210
And I'm releasing the clutch.

688
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,630
And I'm slowing down.
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm slowing down.

689
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,170
All right!

690
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,090
I have a feeling it's going to be great!

691
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,770
There was one world, and then ho.....

692
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,770
Did you see me, Mireille?
I'm huddled on the sidewalk.

693
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,490
Off.
handbrake.

694
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,680
Ignition.

695
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,120
Margarita,

696
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,910
is it definitely set for 2:00?

697
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,640
You don't have to ask me
every five minutes!

698
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,990
You're just nervous.
- No, I'm not nervous!

699
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,360
I'm very calm.

700
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,360
I'm not embarrassed
I'm not embarrassed at all.

701
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,360
But we could, Dad,
could we go over the rules again?

702
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,010
I've read them 2 times.

703
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,660
It's not like I'm gonna sign up
for night classes,

704
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:48,010
to memorize a brochure
12 pages! Ridiculous!

705
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,720
Let's get strong.

706
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,140
Who's there?

707
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,360
Just don't worry.

708
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,180
I knew it, he's having lunch!

709
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,800
It's noon, my dear!
At noon, the French.

710
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,300
Of course! It's a forgivable habit
in normal times.

711
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,480
But all exams are based
on the same principle:

712
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,600
full head, empty stomach!

713
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,760
Difficult digestion
is the candidate's enemy.

714
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,150
You'll fall asleep at the wheel.

715
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:17,790
О!

716
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,890
Mr. Martan,

717
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:22,010
weak tea improves
mental acuity.

718
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:24,280
Look at the English!
- I hate tea!

719
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,800
The English, too!

720
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,460
Oh, but they're not easy guys,
these young men!

721
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,140
- I did what you asked!
- Well done!

722
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,840
And may I ask,
what you did?

723
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,050
My father called the examiner -
yours and Mrs. Martin's.

724
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,220
Blat?!

725
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,830
Monsieur, I have failed
I have failed at many things in my life,

726
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,460
but I failed them
on my own!

727
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,090
Besides, I don't believe in blatancy.

728
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,400
But it's not about blag,
Mr. Martin!

729
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,590
We just gave your names
to the examiner,

730
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,500
only stating that morally.
you deserve a driver's license.

731
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,220
That's all.
- Oh, okay. That's better!

732
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,520
Another thing.

733
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,520
Be brave!
Everything is on your side!

734
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,980
In that case,
thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.

735
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,620
- We'll come over to celebrate your success!
- See you soon, then!

736
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,710
Maybe we could have a cup of tea,
Marguerite?

737
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,920
I don't have any tea.

738
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,180
Would you like an orange, Daddy?

739
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,180
Oh, no!
I'm sick of oranges!

740
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,790
Well, you shouldn't have turned over
the whole cart!

741
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,520
How! It's you!

742
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,740
Don't be nervous!

743
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,830
- They're coming!
- They're coming.

744
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,480
А! They're coming.

745
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:50,240
The stopping is flawless!
My style!

746
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,780
Leon, look!

747
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,010
Yay!

748
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:58,250
- Are you all right, Carteret?
- Everything's fine, Mr. Inspector.

749
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,960
All right. [Chuckles]
Go have some coffee.

750
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,160
I'll take an exam from one or two,
reminisce about my youth.

751
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,120
Oh, that's great.

752
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,420
- Well, it's my turn.
- Go on, you don't want to keep him waiting.

753
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:13,130
I'll see you soon.

754
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,980
Is he kind?
- The sweetest!

755
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,360
You couldn't have done better!

756
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,840
Come on, don't be afraid.
It's not the President of the Republic.

757
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:29,000
Hello, monsieur!

758
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,830
Martan! Leon Martin.

759
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,160
It's me.

760
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,840
I know.

761
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,000
Yes,

762
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,540
I know you know.

763
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,240
Believe it or not,

764
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,740
I abhor
any form of favoritism.

765
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,940
Of course, in serious
cases like mine.

766
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,880
Shall we go? Let's go.

767
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,390
Would you allow me to ask you
a few questions about the rules?

768
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,390
Please.
Please, please.

769
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,440
Let's get these
little formalities.

770
00:44:58,510 --> 00:45:00,180
You're very confident.

771
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm sure of you, too.

772
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:09,000
When you cross a busy street
traffic, what do you do?

773
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:15,200
Actually, mind you, normally.
Margarita would be the driver.

774
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,800
She just passed.
- And suppose Marguerite didn't?

775
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,090
Well...

776
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,460
Well, then, if there's nowhere
there are no cars anywhere.

777
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,920
well, if there isn't one,
right or left.

778
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:30,720
I'm passing through.

779
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:33,560
But if the traffic
is very dense?

780
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,640
Dense traffic?
Well, if it's heavy traffic,

781
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,100
Well, then I guess there'll be a guard there.
I'll do what he says!

782
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,020
All right. Uh-huh.

783
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,640
A little judgment and
a little discretion and caution, and it'll all work out!

784
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,080
It's not complicated!

785
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,520
What's the sign that warns you
about turning?

786
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,640
A sign that warns
about turning?

787
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,280
It's a pink sign
with green edges around it,

788
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,540
and a big zigzag
in the middle.

789
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:06,080
Sometimes they add children
playing with baskets.

790
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:07,440
Mm-hmm.

791
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:08,670
Let's go.

792
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,250
I'll close it, it's windy!

793
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,600
Oh, your hat!

794
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,760
Oh, I'm sorry.

795
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:20,080
- It's a different examiner!
- Oh, they're all worthy.

796
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,560
- Oh, no!
- Here, I got it, Mr. Inspector.

797
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,960
I'm sorry, that was
involuntary movement.

798
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,100
I hope it's not too badly spoiled.
- Come on, let's go!

799
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,300
Would you like to drive?
No? Yes... okay.

800
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,140
If he's good at shifting
in first, he'll be saved.

801
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,980
Disaster!

802
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,800
It's obvious he learned
on a hearse!

803
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,080
Get out of here!

804
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,960
I'd get out! But how?
They're everywhere!

805
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,280
It's been 20 minutes
since they left!

806
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,420
- Why don't we go for tea in Rambouillet?
- Very funny!

807
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,300
I didn't pass?

808
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,280
You're making fun of me
at me?!

809
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,640
Oh, that's how it is! All right...
We'll see about that.

810
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,380
Next!

811
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,480
- How am I doing?
- You'll be fine with a shotgun.

812
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,480
Of course, there will still be
the cuffs.

813
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,060
And the car?
We have to decide today!

814
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:52,100
We'll go soon. We'll go to the place
where Duchemin bought his truck.

815
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:13,740
Hopefully, for 300,000 francs.
we'll find something decent.

816
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,740
Yeah, I've got three more Sourditos
three more Surditos.

817
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,100
Anyway,

818
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:21,420
you'll have to behave
smart, Marguerite.

819
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,180
You know, uh,
things are heating up at home.

820
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,900
My parents launched an attack
to get me to marry their protégé.

821
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,940
- Hélène Cordier?
- Yes, of course.

822
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,940
Her father will soon be
richer than mine!

823
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,640
This is just unacceptable!

824
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,800
- And she'll be on your hunt?
- Yes, she will.

825
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,640
It's in two days, Mireille.

826
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,760
They won't make me!

827
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,300
If I have to, I'll run away
and come after you.

828
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,540
We'll walk hand in hand through the streets,
and sleep under bridges!

829
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,900
We're gonna be happy,
because we'll be together!

830
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,900
And taking advantage of the fact
of the music hitting your ears,

831
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,100
I will tell you
that I love you,

832
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,700
while the rest of us
can't hear us.

833
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:11,580
KING
USED CARS

834
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,420
"DRIVING LOW."

835
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,080
"AS NEW."

836
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,380
"ONE OWNER"

837
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,940
"DRIVING LOW."

838
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,740
"AS NEW."

839
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,500
Is this a job? А? A job?!

840
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,300
You've been here eight days,
and you've done nothing but do stupid things!

841
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,260
Well, I'm telling you:
you're fired!

842
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,760
Oh, no, monsieur.
Mr. Chartrice!

843
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,080
Mr. Chartreuse!

844
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,200
Give me one last chance!
- No!

845
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,880
I have a large family,
who can't take any hardship.

846
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,740
So be it! But I say
in the presence of your comrades:

847
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:47,880
I'll keep you if you sell the 777 C75
if you sell the 777 C75.

848
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,340
"777 С75" ?!

849
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,780
She's crossed the Sahara 14 times!
At least 14 times!

850
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,260
Nobody wants her!
- Get out of it!

851
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,100
But it's unsellable!

852
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:05,340
There's a lot of complicated work
complicated work, and then, uh.

853
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,340
All right,
I'm gonna go pack my things.

854
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,840
There's a scooter store
is offering me a job.

855
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,620
Right where I belong.
I was kicked out eight days ago.

856
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:14,420
And here, perhaps,
your clients.

857
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,960
Nervous, shy....

858
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:18,760
It's their first car.

859
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,180
If they come in,
you might have a chance.

860
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,540
Hello, monsieur.

861
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,540
Hello, monsieur,
hello, madame!

862
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:43,240
Heaven sent you.
I hope so.

863
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,780
We need a car,
of course.

864
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,120
That's great,
we got 87 of them!

865
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,660
I should add that we've had them for a long time.
So we know them like the back of our hand.

866
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,660
Follow me.

867
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,220
The problem is relatively simple...

868
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,860
We need
a big car!

869
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:02,460
- Ah! Big car?
- Yeah, big car.

870
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,780
I mean, do you want
a big car?

871
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:08,400
- Yeah, I'm good for it.
- Uh, okay. Uh, excuse me for a second.

872
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,540
Be persistent.
It's like you're begging!

873
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,000
Leave it to me!

874
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,520
They want a big car.

875
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,860
I said: "777 С75" !

876
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,600
He was impressed with us.

877
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,940
He consults with his superiors.

878
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,360
- All right, I'll go organize.
- Uh, yeah.

879
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,200
Are you done?

880
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,700
No.

881
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,700
Take them for a walk.

882
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:37,040
Well, I'm gonna go for a walk with them.

883
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,100
А! Here we go!

884
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,840
Do you want a well-known brand?

885
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,920
We need one that's gonna
to make an impression.

886
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,980
It's for an engagement at Solonie.

887
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,180
First for the engagement party, but to make sure
the car would serve us well afterward.

888
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,820
Wait, wait, wait... You need
a car to go to the engagement party,

889
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:58,100
and then, uh. So you're saying you need her
need her at least twice?

890
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,360
Well, yeah, at least two times.

891
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,260
- We have this.
- But we need a new car!

892
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,020
Oh, you're right about that.
The pre-war models have faded.

893
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,060
Look, don't give up hope.
Nothing is impossible!

894
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,060
- So...
- Attention, young man!

895
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,700
I work in an office
with 25 upholstery machines.

896
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,500
So, the car is comfortable, quiet....

897
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,500
And the motor?

898
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,780
Well, with a motor, of course.

899
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,560
Well, naturally. You don't buy a car
to push a car!

900
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,840
We'll take the motor that comes
that comes with the car.

901
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,880
So, comfortable, quiet.
and with its own motor.

902
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,620
This one is perfect!

903
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,620
It's gorgeous!

904
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:35,600
I can already see the faces
of our friends in the yard.

905
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,600
И...

906
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,600
is it expensive?

907
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,440
It's not very expensive.
It has a small drawback.

908
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,980
She's a little "floaty."

909
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,900
- Amphibious?
- No, I don't know. Anyway.

910
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,900
She hesitates on the bends.

911
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,300
Not long, but hesitant.

912
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,440
So you have to...
Anyway, don't get too turned around.

913
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,500
Not too much... Well, we all have
flaws-- you, me--

914
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,300
That's understandable.
But don't you have a model

915
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,760
not so dangerous?

916
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,220
We'll find it, we'll find it!
Nothing is impossible!

917
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,980
Uh, excuse me. Uh, so.

918
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,320
Would you mind telling me
my boy,

919
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,100
why are your coworkers
staring at us like that?

920
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,460
They're rookies.
Watching me work,

921
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:21,320
so that later on.
to adopt my style.

922
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,920
I'll be honest with you,
I'm kind of the owner's favorite around here.

923
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,620
But let's not...

924
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,620
That's so funny!

925
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,880
It's, uh. well, it's, uh. no.

926
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,640
Do you know if you have this model
do you have this model? I'd love to.

927
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,860
Alas, it's a Bulgarian model.
You won't find it at all.

928
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,200
- All right, then.
- Please!

929
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,460
Uh, no, it's that way...

930
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,520
You're a strange salesman.
You don't advise us.

931
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,020
We're an honest store.

932
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,860
I can't let you
drive off in the middle of nowhere!

933
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,080
I can't feel my legs anymore!

934
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,900
Never mind! It's not like we're getting out of here
We're not walking out of here!

935
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,580
What about this one?

936
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,860
Uh, uh. Uh, well.

937
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,300
No, no, no! You can't!
It'll break!

938
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,020
It's gonna break! Please!

939
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,100
There's this...

940
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,520
Young man,
why don't you talk about this one?

941
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,260
Well, this one's not for sale!

942
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,400
Is that so? And why?

943
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:25,220
The management is keeping her
for themselves.

944
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,860
What do you mean he keeps it for himself?

945
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,140
As far as I know, this place
everything's for sale. No?

946
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,940
Otherwise it wouldn't be here!
- Leon, Leon.

947
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,980
That pink hat that looked so good on you,
you sent to your client?

948
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:36,780
No, I kept it.

949
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,400
So don't get involved.
I'll handle it.

950
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,280
Э... how much?
- 290.

951
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,060
But I doubt
you'll be able to get it.

952
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,940
Young man,
bring in your superintendent.

953
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,940
Listen to me! What you need
a big car,

954
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,700
it's small!
Well, you know, it's just, uh.

955
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,100
Maybe I should give you a warning.

956
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,220
I said "big car,"
I didn't say "barge."

957
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:59,240
4 hp. - it's a big car,
if you're getting in it

958
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,020
not very big people.

959
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,020
Mr. Chartreuse!

960
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,500
Yes? What's the matter?

961
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:08,120
These monsieurs and madams
want your car.

962
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,500
A pearl!

963
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,500
I'm taking her home
tonight.

964
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,740
- I liked her.
- I'm sorry.

965
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,920
I promised it to my wife.
She's good at this.

966
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,940
Listen, monsieur,
going around your store,

967
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,940
you're sure to find
amongst these beautiful cars

968
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,180
a nice car
for Mrs. Charlessris!

969
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,900
All right, all right! I give up!

970
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,460
Take it!
- Thank you.

971
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,160
- I'm so excited.
- Me too!

972
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,660
Me too!

973
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,140
Take a look!

974
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,480
1,250 kilometers? She's only got...

975
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,840
What?!

976
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:52,840
Yeah, she's only got 1,250 kilometers.

977
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,440
That's it.
You can trust the meter.

978
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,080
Because in the rain.
the customers wouldn't leave,

979
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,820
and in nice weather.
- even more so.

980
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,820
You can see, by the way, that she's been taken care of.

981
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,380
Well, nothing's impossible.

982
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:09,240
And, you see, at speed.
it will work!

983
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,580
All right, then,
I'm gonna start her up!

984
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,400
I'm gonna turn the key in the ignition
on the count of three!

985
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,380
One... two... three!

986
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,060
It's a cinch!
- I had no doubt!

987
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:24,360
I'll take it!
- Wait, let me go!

988
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:29,020
Monsieur, we are buying this car,
to make our daughter proud of us.

989
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,020
She's really good, isn't she?

990
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,920
Cars like this--

991
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,420
just a little bit, believe me!
You'll see.

992
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,740
They're all the same.
They save the good times for themselves.

993
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:51,020
But this time.
you got the wrong guy!

994
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:54,260
All right. (chuckles)

995
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,800
If there are any malfunctions,

996
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,680
you have until tomorrow
until tomorrow, 12:00.

997
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:04,920
Well, 12, 12. 12 and a quarter!
Don't worry!

998
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:06,140
I'm sorry.

999
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,520
If you're wondering where the motor is,
it's right here in the back.

1000
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,300
- Goodbye, monsieur, and thank you!
- Goodbye!

1001
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,800
Here you go.
We tortured you, huh?

1002
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,600
There's a little bit.
But that's okay.

1003
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,080
No offense. You're welcome.
- Oh, it's this way.

1004
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,100
No, not that way. This way.
Please.

1005
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,100
Let me go.

1006
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,340
- But you don't have a license!
- But I'm a better driver!

1007
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,840
What an ego! What if you
hurt someone?

1008
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,840
Then we're gonna make a quick switch
places. Move.

1009
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,360
Hold on, I'm moving.

1010
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,440
Let me drive
my car!

1011
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,260
I can tell,
you just got your license!

1012
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,400
Do you own
this machine?

1013
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,560
- Turn the motor off!
- I can't!

1014
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,860
- Take the key out of the ignition!
- I did! Here it is, the key!

1015
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,780
What's going on?
- Admit you don't know.

1016
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,480
Oh, just a minute, huh?

1017
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,560
All that's left
to stop the windshield wipers.

1018
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,920
The engine must have gotten a little
overheated. You'll see.

1019
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,340
You've been sold a model
with a very independent character.

1020
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,320
But we, my dear,
we're still doing it!

1021
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,740
We parked in front of your house
because there were no spaces across the street.

1022
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,740
- Want to go for a ride?
- Never!

1023
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,740
I have an aversion
to automobiles!

1024
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,280
He's so post-Marna!

1025
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,680
He was in a cab
between Fauche and Galliani,

1026
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,320
my son-in-law was driving...
- Enough, Hélène! Enough!

1027
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:29,120
I didn't touch anything!

1028
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,460
It sometimes starts on its own.

1029
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,460
Maybe there's something about the plugs
not shutting off properly?

1030
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:40,280
Hush, Marguerite! Hush!

1031
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,280
Quiet!

1032
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,740
You see!

1033
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,660
She reacts to noise.
I should have known.

1034
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:50,120
- Ah, the case, Marguerite!
- A case?

1035
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,400
- Give it!
- Careful.

1036
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,580
Don't turn left!
You're turning left!

1037
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,800
Wait, that's it.
- Spin it!

1038
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,300
- Don't pull, don't pull!
- Just spin it!

1039
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:06,180
And in general,
stretch it first!

1040
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,940
Stick to the system!

1041
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:09,940
Let me pull first.

1042
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,660
Is that right?
- That's right.

1043
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,040
It's going to work.
- I can't do it!

1044
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,740
Did you do that on purpose?

1045
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,360
- It's not me, it's the wind!
- Yeah, the wind, the wind.

1046
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,180
- We need to coordinate our efforts.
- Now, hold on.

1047
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:28,160
Guillard, don't laugh,
but command it.

1048
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:31,340
Attention!
On my command:

1049
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,500
once...

1050
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:33,940
two...

1051
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,520
three!

1052
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,200
Oh, shit!

1053
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,200
To tell you the truth,
it was a little small.

1054
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,980
- Where am I supposed to hook it up?
- Like me, to the bumper.

1055
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,700
There's no bumper.

1056
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,800
- How is there no bumper?
- No bumper.

1057
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,100
- No bumper...
- I'm telling you, no bumper.

1058
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,280
- Ha, no bumper!
- Go look for yourself!

1059
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,560
Here, look.

1060
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,780
No bumper?
Probably lost it on the road.

1061
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:01,400
She's good!
She's very good!

1062
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,180
Yeah, it's good, but we'll
we'll show it to you tomorrow,

1063
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:06,380
because today.
she made a huge effort.

1064
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,020
But you don't have a bumper!

1065
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,880
No, my dear,
there's no bumper. I know there is.

1066
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,420
Have a nice day!

1067
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,980
You see that car,
Marguerite?

1068
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:20,740
And there's nothing special about her
nothing special about her, huh?

1069
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,260
But I definitely
like her!

1070
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,260
I love it!

1071
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:38,000
AUTO PARTS STORE

1072
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,780
Pay attention, daddy,
when you turn around!

1073
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:06,560
- Mr. Martan!
- Mr. Deputy Director!

1074
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,520
- Did you buy the bumper?
- Yeah. But I got the rest of it, too.

1075
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,040
Such a small
modest car.

1076
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,320
Uh, would you please come
to my office.

1077
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,320
I'm sorry...

1078
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,320
Mr. Martin,
since you have a car,

1079
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,260
I would ask you to go with me to inspect
of Robert and Auguste's upcoming motorcades.

1080
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:24,040
I suspect there's an inappropriate spirit
there's an inappropriate spirit in our office!

1081
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:25,460
Observe
and then report back!

1082
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:27,040
All right, Mr. Deputy Director.

1083
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:31,920
Would you allow me
ask you for a favor?

1084
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,640
- Spell it out.
- Here.

1085
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:37,480
With any luck, my daughter
might be getting engaged tomorrow.

1086
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,020
- It depends on what?
- On the hunt, Mr. Deputy Director.

1087
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:44,280
For my daughter's happiness.
I will enter a very closed society.

1088
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,980
I'll shoot my paws....
- I don't understand anything!

1089
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:49,600
Go take your day off!
- Thank you, sorry.

1090
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,600
They've come to inspect,
Mr. Martin?

1091
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,700
Yes, dear Bosro.
Do you mind? Is everything all right in there?

1092
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,500
- See for yourself.
- Okay, I will.

1093
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:29,220
But what are they doing?
We'll never make it this far!

1094
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:32,380
Hello, gentlemen...
Hello, gentlemen!

1095
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,800
I hope you're happy. э,
satisfied with the beautiful ceremony.

1096
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,440
No, it's kind of endless!
Where's the driver?

1097
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,760
You're going now.
You are.

1098
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,160
- That thing burst again.
- Robert!

1099
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,060
Oh, you bastard!

1100
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:54,580
Hey, Robert, what are you doing?! I'm not going.
I have my own car!

1101
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:05,940
Robert, stop!
Are you crazy?

1102
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:07,080
He started it!

1103
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,280
Trying to get away from me,
because I'm more loaded!

1104
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,080
- Shut up, please!
- Yeah, very elegant!

1105
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,820
Oh, sorry! We're going fast.

1106
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:33,600
If you have a moment,
take a look at the speedometer!

1107
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,060
Slow down, Robert!

1108
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:01,580
Auguste, stop this bullfight!
I'm firing you! Both of you!

1109
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,020
Here we go.

1110
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,820
You shouldn't have
to stand up for us, Mr. Martin.

1111
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:30,320
- All three of us got fired.
- How stupid! For some sin.

1112
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,580
The race would still be on,

1113
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:36,760
but what ruined us was that you lost
the coffin on the Quai de Javel.

1114
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:40,820
- What will you do, Mr. Martin?
- Oh, I don't know.

1115
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:44,620
I'm not gonna say anything at home yet,
because tomorrow. we have, uh.

1116
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:46,440
great day!

1117
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,680
They're coming!

1118
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,400
- Good morning!
- Oh, you're gorgeous!

1119
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,660
Splendid! Splendid!

1120
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:08,060
Oh, that looks good on you!

1121
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:10,660
It's not as great
as your husband's, but it suits!

1122
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:13,400
I'll try not to mess it up.

1123
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,820
- Ah, a gun!
- Always useful!

1124
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:21,560
Marcel used it to shoot down
an airplane in 1940!

1125
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:24,040
The machine was falling,
and Marcel was calmly aiming.

1126
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,420
This may be cruel,
but it's either the plane or him!

1127
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:28,580
Ellen, I'm ordering you
to return to the house.

1128
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,340
Now!

1129
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:35,240
- Not too brutal?
- You're not going to play, you're going to kill!

1130
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,020
- It's my first time.
- I'm sorry.

1131
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:45,560
A booty bag.
Credibility is in the details.

1132
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,820
We'll fill it!

1133
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:49,800
The guiding principle:
Don't skimp on accessories.

1134
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,800
My father's binoculars!

1135
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,480
The real Leon!

1136
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:00,660
Good luck!

1137
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:03,100
Watch the gun!

1138
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,260
My respects, everyone!

1139
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:58,820
Good luck! Bye!

1140
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:01,900
Ellen, would you please hand me
my logbook.

1141
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:03,900
Yes, Father.

1142
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:08,080
Here you go.

1143
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:11,900
Let's do it!

1144
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:21,900
2 liters of "super."

1145
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,560
3 liters of plain.

1146
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:30,720
2 liters of "super."

1147
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:34,980
4 liters of plain.

1148
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:39,640
2 liters of "super."

1149
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:43,860
5 liters of plain.

1150
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:49,740
This is a dosage of my invention,
that gives you a lightning-fast leap from your seat.

1151
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:51,480
2 liters of "super."

1152
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,480
How long is it gonna be like this?

1153
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:59,240
Maurice, I want you to pass the word
"get out" to this fanfare.

1154
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,700
Answer your master,

1155
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:04,320
that it's better to look like a fanfaron,
than an old mummy with a nervous tic!

1156
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,180
Jokes!
- Enough!

1157
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,880
I don't mess with vacationers
going rabbit hunting!

1158
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,640
I'll get gas
somewhere else!

1159
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,920
Vacationers.
You're the vacationer!

1160
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,080
Did you see this one?
- I did.

1161
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,500
- I answered him!
- Well done!

1162
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:24,600
10 liters.

1163
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,040
How far is it to Orleans?
- 12 kilometers.

1164
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:33,880
Fanfaron.
I don't care about the fanfaron.

1165
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:13,260
Monsieur! Bring the car over here!

1166
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:16,020
With their parking system.
no one will see we're in a car!

1167
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:18,060
Do what everyone else does.

1168
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,780
And who's that?

1169
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:22,260
Dad, these are my guests.

1170
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:25,260
The nicest people.
Monsieur has a big business.

1171
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:29,180
If I were him, I'd have a smaller business
a smaller business with a bigger car.

1172
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,980
Come on, I saw it.

1173
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:38,100
Well, look.

1174
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:41,360
They would have walked from the train station,
the effect would have been the same.

1175
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:44,240
All right, let's go.

1176
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,820
We're out!

1177
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:51,820
First impressions
is of the utmost importance.

1178
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:54,120
Oh, we've done everything
necessary.

1179
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:07,900
Leon Martin.

1180
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,900
My wife. My daughter.

1181
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,200
She studies pharmaco-...?
- Dynamics.

1182
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,500
pharmaco-dynamics with your
big boy. Hello!

1183
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,660
- My wife, Mrs. De Granlew.
- Madame, it's a pleasure.

1184
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,760
- How do you do?
- Mr. and Mrs. De Grandcourt.

1185
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,760
All nobility, I see!

1186
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,760
But not me. Cordier!

1187
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:28,960
An old mummy
with a nervous tic.

1188
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,160
That was a poor choice of words.
You don't have a tic any more than anyone else.

1189
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:34,460
The nicest people!

1190
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:36,620
It's that girl
that's been bugging you so much?

1191
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,620
All right, let's go!

1192
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:40,620
Yeah, let's go!

1193
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,860
Everybody to their cars!

1194
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:47,200
We'll set up posts along the edge
of my La Renee forest.

1195
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:54,400
Give me your gun, monsieur.

1196
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,520
All right, then. Thank you.

1197
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,980
Well, what am I gonna use
to shoot my paws with?

1198
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,860
And that's when my father bought everything:

1199
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:15,360
a village, a hill,
the local railroad.

1200
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,720
It will serve
for traveling servants.

1201
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:22,400
I envy you: you're so rich,
and yet you've managed to stay so simple!

1202
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,020
We could get started,
but your parents aren't here, young lady.

1203
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:29,480
- Don't forget, they only have four horsepower.
- You're right, young lady.

1204
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,140
Don't be angry,
I'm an old grouch.

1205
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:34,040
If you'll excuse us, we'll go,
and the guard will wait for your parents.

1206
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,260
Léon!
- Monsieur?

1207
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:38,140
Stay here, you'll catch up with us
with Monsieur and Mrs. Martin.

1208
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,900
Do you have his gun?
- I'll take care of it, sir.

1209
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,540
All right. Uh-huh.

1210
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:45,420
He likes you.
I'm sure he likes you.

1211
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:47,420
It worked!

1212
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,020
Hello!

1213
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:07,700
Where are our friends?
- We'll go to them with Mirka.

1214
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,820
My name is Leon.
- Oh, me too!

1215
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:11,540
We have the same name!

1216
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:16,300
And we have the same jackets.
- But you have different hats!

1217
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:18,980
Oh, you've got my gun!
Let's go.

1218
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:21,720
My gun.
let's call it what it is.

1219
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:25,180
Shall we go? Let's go.

1220
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,100
Leon!

1221
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:56,320
- Hello, monsieur.
- I saw her, but she didn't wait.

1222
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:59,200
He's so surprised
that you blew it.

1223
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:28,200
That dog's not exactly
condescending.

1224
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,520
What is that?
Is she swearing at me?!

1225
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,860
- She's got the trail!
- Again?

1226
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,620
I'm sorry.

1227
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,400
Missed!

1228
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,100
She's leaving.

1229
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:18,760
Come on, go away, you animal!

1230
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:21,240
I can't hunt
when people are pissing on me.

1231
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,580
Try to kill something for her
kill something for her.

1232
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:26,480
I do what I can!
I'm the only one you can hear!

1233
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:36,800
Damn it!

1234
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:42,980
Ah, there they are!
- Give me a hand.

1235
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,240
- Quietly, quietly.
- I'm going quietly.

1236
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:49,160
Careful, that's it.

1237
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,540
I had the strangest bad luck
I didn't kill anything.

1238
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,540
It's beautiful!

1239
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,280
Oh, Marguerite!

1240
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:59,680
We'll still have
something to eat.

1241
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:03,600
All right, let's move
200 meters to St. Auban.

1242
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,840
- Are we going back?
- No, honey, not now.

1243
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,840
No, no, Leon!

1244
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,040
Allow me, but this time.
deaf real.

1245
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,580
Stop, don't!

1246
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:17,840
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it?

1247
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:19,840
I say,
it's a beautiful day!

1248
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,320
Great weather!

1249
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,320
Sunshine!

1250
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:29,060
- May I serve, madam?
- No, they're not all here yet.

1251
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:36,720
I don't understand why you're stubbornly picking
possibly poisonous mushrooms?

1252
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,720
I don't want to come back
empty-handed!

1253
01:18:39,860 --> 01:18:43,300
- I'll try to track down your parents.
- Thank you, Paul.

1254
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,440
Oh, there's plenty more!

1255
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:50,680
I don't want to interfere
your pleasure,

1256
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,840
but this is the third
dinner bell.

1257
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:55,100
Oh, my God! Come on, let's go!

1258
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,420
Ooh-la-la-la! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1259
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:07,620
Here are your parents,
young lady.

1260
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:16,260
Here you go. Just, uh.
I want my hat back.

1261
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:25,400
Excuse us, we were walking
at a measured pace.

1262
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:29,080
The forest is so beautiful, so peaceful.
Compared to Paris.

1263
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,800
That's not what I thought.

1264
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:35,000
That you're from the village!
- Why?

1265
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,000
Little things.

1266
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,400
As soon as Paul gets back,
we'll sit at the table.

1267
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,740
You never eat on time
eat on time.

1268
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:44,180
In 1952.
at my friend Lesueur's,

1269
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:47,400
CEO
of Robiche Enterprises.

1270
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,800
I'm sorry.

1271
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,200
How well do you know
the CEO of Robiche?

1272
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,200
Very close.

1273
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,780
There's a nice guy living in my house,
a simple accountant,

1274
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:00,280
who just happens to work
at one of the branches.

1275
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,020
What's his name?

1276
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,540
Martan. Martan is like me.

1277
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,540
It's a pretty
common last name.

1278
01:20:06,740 --> 01:20:09,160
This man,
not very young,

1279
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:12,320
was unfairly,
very unfairly fired yesterday.

1280
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,200
Leon! You got fired?!

1281
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:16,760
Yes, Marguerite.

1282
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:19,260
Some accountant!

1283
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,640
Now, I guess
it's all clear now.

1284
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,220
Oh, that's enough!

1285
01:20:24,220 --> 01:20:26,720
Exactly, Mr. Cordier,
it's very clear!

1286
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,900
We were wrong about each other,
that's all.

1287
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:30,440
It happens.

1288
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,820
I think the one who's most disappointed
- is me.

1289
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:36,420
If you knew what it took
for some accountant to get on that hunt!

1290
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:38,100
Buy a car,
the ugliest car ever!

1291
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:41,840
He sold 50 hearing aids
for the deaf after hours!

1292
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,100
And even though

1293
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,480
accountants get tired
after a day's work.

1294
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:48,480
It's very hard
pretending to be rich!

1295
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:51,000
It's very hard
to keep up the mark in the hunt,

1296
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,300
when you've never held a gun
ever held a gun in your life!

1297
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:56,180
Everything my wife and I are wearing.
we borrowed.

1298
01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:58,160
Neighbors! Thing by thing.

1299
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:01,440
Yeah, imagine that--
she loves your son.

1300
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,440
He really loves you.

1301
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:05,080
But it doesn't matter.

1302
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:07,220
We'll marry her off
to some clerk.

1303
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:09,220
To each his own kingdom.

1304
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:12,760
- Mr. Martin!
- Thank you, sir.

1305
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:14,760
I know the way.

1306
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:24,220
Oh, come on,
are we crying?

1307
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,900
But it's Cordier, isn't it?

1308
01:21:46,900 --> 01:21:50,780
My father must have kicked them out.
He can't stand fools!

1309
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:00,400
I still don't understand
how Father Marthan

1310
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,520
managed to reinstate the three of us
back to work, and with a raise!

1311
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,260
By proxy!

1312
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:15,460
What kind of car do you want
to go to church in, honey?

1313
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:21,960
Good taste in girls!

1314
01:22:26,340 --> 01:22:28,200
Guillard, come sit with us.
We'll squeeze in!

1315
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:30,680
No, thanks.
I'll walk!

1316
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,300
You'll be late!

1317
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,040
Let's move!

1318
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,860
Hey, Martan!

1319
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:36,240
I'll ask the priest to wait!

1320
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,320
Traffic all the way
Concord Square.

1321
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,820
Hey, let's take the subway!

1322
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,480
Come on, daughter.

1323
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,860
Did you see that?
The doors close themselves!

1324
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:24,120
What a mess!
Hey, did you see that?

1325
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:41,560
