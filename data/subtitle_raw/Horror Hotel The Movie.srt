00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:36,035
You are out Rodger!

2
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:38,237
You're no good and you're gone.

3
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,041
I've waited long enough for you to
shape up and now you're out for good.

4
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,143
Aw! Come on Cindy.
Don't be like that.

5
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:48,514
By now Mister Rodger Dodger, you should
have given up that crummy job at

6
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:52,584
the glue factory and gotten something
that pays a whole lot better.

7
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:56,221
I deserve more than
a title pawned car.

8
00:00:56,223 --> 00:01:01,268
No! I'm tired of staying in
this week-to-week Motor Court.

9
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:03,662
You need to get more money

10
00:01:03,664 --> 00:01:08,801
or you're out.

11
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,312
May I help you?

12
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,249
Our Space Buggy
is about to crash.

13
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,485
This is a really cool scene.

14
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:29,288
Space Buggy? What Space Buggy?

15
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,562
That is our Space Buggy.

16
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:40,866
It looks like your Space Buggy
just pancaked Cindy's Super Bee.

17
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:44,303
Yeah. Gnarly splashdown.

18
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:48,340
Who was driving that thing?

19
00:01:48,843 --> 00:01:50,609
Oh! I was.

20
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,848
Our Space buggy is equipped with
a Time Advance Ejection System.

21
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,086
In the event of imminent crash it transports
passengers to an earlier time frame

22
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,590
away from danger.

23
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:10,295
I could have used something
like that a few times myself.

24
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:17,903
You totally wiped out my car. I hope
you guys got some good insurance.

25
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:25,677
We do not have
insurance in space.

26
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:31,750
You're not in space anymore. Here on
Earth you've got to have insurance.

27
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,088
You girls had better wait in
my room while I call Al Sharko.

28
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:52,838
Let me find that title pawn to my car.
I know it's here somewhere.

29
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:07,686
What is your name
you dreamy hunk?

30
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,589
I'm Rodger! Rodger Dodger.

31
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:15,727
What a sexy name. My name is Aeliana.
My friend's name is Minoria.

32
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:21,200
Some kind of groovy!
Rodger Dodger baby.

33
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:24,203
Well! It's certainly a pleasure.

34
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:27,839
Smooth vibes Daddy-O.

35
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:35,447
So! What are you girls doing crash landing
your Space Buggy in this parking lot?

36
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,284
How come you didn't land that
thing over at the airport?

37
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:44,688
Moisture condensation caused our rear stabilizer
to freeze as we entered your stratosphere.

38
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:50,896
I totally lost
control for a while.

39
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:54,600
After the servos thawed
from atmospheric heat

40
00:03:54,602 --> 00:03:59,738
I was able to get enough control
to set it down on open pavement.

41
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:07,112
Obviously not enough control
to avoid wasting my car.

42
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,115
That Super Bee was title
pawned with Al Sharko.

43
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:13,352
Take it easy Cindy.

44
00:04:13,354 --> 00:04:16,188
These nice ladies just
escaped a fiery death.

46
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:20,692

48
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,831
I think I love you.

Dig the wig.
Yummy!

51
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,676
Look! I don't know what
planet you girls are from

52
00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:40,912
but around here, girls leave
other girls boyfriends alone.

53
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:46,051
Oh I'm not really her boyfriend anymore.
Cindy just threw me out.

54
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,687
Oh! No!

55
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:53,825
He's not exactly a permanent throw out.
I was just trying to motivate him.

56
00:04:56,096 --> 00:05:00,832
We have been cruising the
galaxy looking for boyfriends.

57
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:06,204
All the boys on our home planet were
wiped out by testosterone fever.

58
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,709
Yeah! Our cool
dudes be way gone.

59
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:12,711
Rodger Dodger might help us out.

60
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:17,349
Oh I'd like to help you out. How's
the employment situation up there?

61
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:22,454
Well Rodger Dodger. Boys just
need to stay busy being nice.

62
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,324
Girls do all the hard work.

63
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,659
Yeah! Just shoot the tube.

64

Don't you get any ideas about
going anywhere with my boyfriend.

65
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:37,669
And you sure aren't getting out of here until
you clear up the mess you made of my car.

66
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,671
I'm calling...
Where's the phone?

67
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,674
I'm calling Al
Sharko. Right now!

68
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,811

the car you just wrecked.

Hello Mister Sharko.
It's Cindy Wood.

73
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,797
Yeah yeah yeah. The Super
Bee. How's it hanging Cindy?

74
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:09,701
Not good. There's some flakey chicks
over here who just crashed into my car

75
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,838
and totally wasted it
with their spaceship.

76
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:16,208
Some Flakey chicks wasted
your car with a spaceship?

77
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,476
Sure did!

78
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:19,845
They say they don't
have any insurance.

79
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:23,215
You'd better come over
and talk to them about it.

80
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,850
I'll be right there.

81
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,995
How would you girls like
a Sonic Screwdriver?

82
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,587
It's an Earth drink that
everyone here loves.

83
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:44,836
I just happen to have some
Who Juice and plenty of Vodka.

84
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:48,407
Yeah! Lay it on me momma.

85
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:53,979
You will just love our home planet, Moe.
You can have your very own Castaway Island

where we can live
happily ever after.

out 'Order of the Black Sun']

91
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:43,695
So you learned all about Earth from
television broadcasts from the sixties?

92
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,932
That was like, fifty
years ago. Man!

93

Our home planet, Moe, is
fifty light years from here.

Television transmission signals
travel slowly at the speed of light.

95
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,846
We were only able to see a few of your
broadcasts, like Dance Train and Castaway Island

96
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:04,883
due to the solar skip.

97
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,452
So! How'd you get here so fast?

98
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:11,690
We equipped our space buggy
with Faster Than Light Drives

99
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,693
that simply folds space

100
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:18,830
so we don't have to travel
those huge distances.

101
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,818
Those dresses are way too short.

102

Do you like them?

103
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,690

00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,904
It is made of cheap platinum.

00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,209
All of it?

Yes.

00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,114
Roger's got a gun.

173
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,318
It was that drink! You
poisoned the Sonic Screwdriver.

174
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:52,390
It wasn't really poison. It was
just some birth control pills.

175
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,139
They were supposed to
make you a little sick.

176
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:57,552
So that you'd leave
my boyfriend alone.

177
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:02,901
I'm not really your boyfriend anymore.
You threw me out. Remember!

178
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,770
Well! Now I'm taking you back.

179
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,872
No!

180
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,775
You're not!

181
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:16,314
You just murdered this
little space chick.

182
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:23,221
It's not murder. She's not
human so it's not murder.

183
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:27,892
It is murder. Looks like she
was way more human than you.

184
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,729
I'm going to call
the authorities.

185
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:35,300
Rodger! It's not poison
in the Sonic Screwdriver.

186
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,029
It's just some
birth control pills.

187
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,939
I'll prove it.

188
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,908
Stop! That could kill you.

189
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:55,653
[Cindy gasps in mortal agony]

190
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,594
I'm calling the hospital.

191
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:05,096
Agh!

192
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,866
Do you really have to call
the authorities Rodger?

193
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:14,005
I really am an Illegal Alien. I am
afraid the authorities will arrest me.

194
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,941
You won't have to be here
when the ambulance shows up.

195
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:21,946
Where will I go? What will I do? I
do not know anyone here but you.

196
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:25,450
Right now you can just hide in my
truck until the paramedics split.

197
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,051
No-one will see you there.

198
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:32,190
Oh Rodger! You can be
my steady boyfriend.

199
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:50,108
You're out Rodger!

200
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:54,495
Aw! Come on Aeliana!
Don't be like that.

201
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:55,891
You had your chance Rodger.
Now I'm going to get mine.

202
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:56,914
Please! I can get better.

203
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,183
You're not getting any better.

204
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,119
You didn't get a
better paying job.

205
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,387
You never have enough money.

206
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,821
Money isn't everything.

207
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,523
Oh yes it is.

208
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:09,193
I'm tired of living in
this sleazy Motor Court.

209
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,896
I want my own paid for car

210
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,232
with a clean title.

211
00:18:51,197 --> 00:18:53,397
Bob

212
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:55,566
Bob

213
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,606
Hey Bob!

214
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,374
What's happening?

215
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:05,109
Bob.

216
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:06,277
Wake up.

217
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,412
You OK?

218
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:15,920
More?

219
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,755
That's a fifty dollar bill.

220
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:18,656
I know.

221
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,891
Today it's a hundred.

222
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
A hundred?

223
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:22,660
Today is a hundred?

224
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,662
Take it or leave it. Marvin.

225
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,134
All those are twenties.
You owe me ten.

226
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:31,469
I own you nothing.

227
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:33,204
You're getting what you want.

228
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,338
For cheap.

229
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,240
Next time it'll be two hundred.

230
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:37,963
Two hundred! What gives?

231
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,914
Take it or leave it.

232
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,612
What's the big idea putting
Connie under all *this trash?

233
00:19:45,637 --> 00:19:47,309
You think she's
just some garbage?

234
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,821
Security's tight around here!

235
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,057
So what!

236
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,592
She lives here.

237
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,733
Next time, don't be putting
all this trash on Connie.

238
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,117
She can wait out in the
open like everybody else.

239
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,449
Don't worry Connie.

240
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:56,787
Money's really no problem.

241
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,717
I can come up with
four hundred next time.

242
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:10,401
The important part is
we're together now.

243
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:12,603
You and me.

244
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,875
You know what day this is?

245
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,078
It's our anniversary baby.

246
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,982
I'll be right back.

247
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:28,385
I've just got to get our
party stuff out of the truck.

248
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:12,263
Brought you some flowers.

249
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,836
Our favorite wine too.

250
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,416
Yep! We were married
seven years ago today.

251
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,321
I'll bet you even remember that funny
little preacher that married us.

252
00:22:37,323 --> 00:22:41,525
He showed up with
a shiny black eye.

253
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,862
Said his mother hit
him with a skillet.

254
00:22:46,332 --> 00:22:50,034
Your father did not
want us getting married.

255
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,169
You know later he told me that

256
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,404
your brother wanted to show up

257
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,573
with a shotgun and
stop the whole thing.

258
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:06,250
I think it's because your family
knows you're smarter than me.

259
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:10,421
But heck, aren't most wives
smarter than their husbands.

260
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,361
They all thought I wasn't
good enough for you.

261
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,029
We showed them.

262
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,232
After seven years,
we're still together.

263
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,475
We'll get you all fixed up
in your favorite nighty.

264
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:43,354
You look stunning!

265
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:52,396
You know I had to stop by
the store and get some ice.

266
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:00,070
The ice machine in
this motel never works.

267
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:39,610
What do you think Connie?

268
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,548
These roses aren't nearly as
pretty as your wedding bouquet.

269
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:58,362
Hmm! That's some good stuff!

270
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,536
That's a really good vino!

271
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:06,937
[knock]

272
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:08,273
What?

273
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,479
[knock]

274
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,083
Excuse me!
This is some kind of mistake.

275
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:20,751
Wrong room!

276
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:22,087
[knock]

277
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:29,894
Bob?

278
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,328
Yep. It's me. Let me in!

279
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,696
This is not a good time Bob.

280
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,698
You need to go away.

281
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,833
Ugh!

282
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,070
Are you here for more money?

283
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,010
No!

284
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:51,448
I'm not here for more money.

285
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:53,851
That's it! You're
leaving right now.

286
00:25:53,853 --> 00:25:56,053
You got that right.

287
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,924
I am leaving right now and
I'm taking Connie with me.

288
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,725
Huh?

289
00:26:02,628 --> 00:26:05,062
Connie and I are in love.

290
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,964
We're in love and
we're getting married.

291
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,632
Connie is not in love with you.

292
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,001
Where'd you get
an idea like that?

293
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:12,503
You know,

294
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:15,573
working nights there's no one
at that nursing home except

295
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:16,840
Connie and me.

296
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:20,444
Her and me got to know
each other real good.

297
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,713
Connie is in a coma.

298
00:26:22,715 --> 00:26:24,415
How was she supposed
to be having these

299
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,684
conversations with you?

300
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:27,551
Well!

301
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:30,187
We just did.

302
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:34,158
I know what she's
thinking because,

303
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,392
I'm like,

304
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:39,263
thinking the same thing.

305
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,732
She speaks to my mind, man.

306
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:46,303
You've been working
midnights way too long Bob.

307
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:49,206
It's done stuff to your mind.

308
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,810
You need to take
your little flowers

309
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:56,747
and go back to the
Convalescent Center.

310
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,282
We have to get married.

311
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,483
It's only right.

312
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,585
How's that?

313
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:04,555
Connie's having my baby!

314
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:05,356
Your baby!

315
00:27:05,358 --> 00:27:07,825
How'd that happen?

316
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,960
The usual way.

317
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:13,030
We got to be good
friends at first

318
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:15,599
and then one thing
led to another.

319
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:18,836
Connie can't be having your
baby for crying out loud!

320
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:20,237
She's in a coma!

321
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:25,009
She may be in a coma but
she can still reproduce.

322
00:27:25,344 --> 00:27:26,344
Ugh!

323
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,730
Come on Connie, it's time to go.

324
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,239
Awk!

325
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,843
Yum!... Awk!

326
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,146
Awk!

327
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,851
You should have let
her go easy Marvin.

328
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:22,066
Why does everybody have to
make everything so hard?

329
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:49,960
When a mans in love, he's got
to do what he's got to do.

330
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:58,135
Awk!

331
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:02,306
(boink!)

332
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:05,642
Connie!

333
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:08,912
You're awake!

334
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:10,681
That's right baby! I'm awake!

335
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:12,816
You're not in a coma anymore!

336
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:15,753
I could hear you talking
to me the whole time.

337
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:18,255
I knew what was happening

338
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:21,291
but couldn't do
anything about it.

339
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:24,228
Do you know what day this is?

340
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,196
It's our anniversary.

341
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:38,075
Sometimes a comatose patient

342
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,944
will regain consciousness
for a short while

343
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:45,682
only to relapse into a
vegetative condition once again.

344
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:50,821
However, this patient will never
regain consciousness.

345
00:30:38,571 --> 00:30:40,838
You're not a cop!

346
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,541
You're nothing but a
two bit bounty hunter.

347
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,677
Buzz off bucko!

348
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,220
Not a bounty hunter,

349
00:30:58,157 --> 00:31:00,691
I'm a skip tracer.

350
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:57,814
Don't guess I need
to offer you a light.

351
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:02,920
Not for this piece of junk.

352
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:05,455
You got any real cigarettes?

353
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:06,690
Na!

354
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:09,826
I decided I'd better
give them up for good

355
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:12,629
when they made possession
a class D felony.

356
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:15,065
Those dirty rotten politicians!

357
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:18,135
I bet those slime-balls
get the real cigarettes

358
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:21,171
straight from China
anytime they want them.

359
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,240
Just trying to protect
people from themselves.

360
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:24,274
Listen Georgia,

361
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,543
I've got to get you downtown

362
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,179
before the judge closes
his docket today.

363
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:30,447
He issued a bench warrant

364
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:33,050
when you didn't show up
for court this morning.

365
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:35,285
I'm not Georgia.

366
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,322
I'm her sister, Paris.

367
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:45,195
Come-on Georgia.

368
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:46,496
Don't mess around.

369
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,899
The judge is already
unhappy with you.

370
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:51,335
Really. We're sisters.

371
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:53,770
We're like, identical.

372
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,405
You're twins?

373
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,908
Well, quintuplets really.

374
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,210
There are five of us.

375
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:02,045
All identical.

376
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:03,046
Quintuplets!

377
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,048
Yeah!

378
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,677
We're some sort of
government experiment

379
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:08,385
to make human clones.

380
00:33:08,387 --> 00:33:10,053
The project became
totally unpopular

381
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:13,123
so we got dumped out here.

382
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,759
Identical clones?

383
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:19,062
All cloned from our mother.

384
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:22,699
And the mighty USA is our daddy.

385
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,568
Wait!

386
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:28,438
The office manager
is your mother.

387
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,639
Yep!

388
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:33,844
Our mother is our
sister too, in a way.

389
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:37,781
A creepy sort-of way

390
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:41,885
Really Paris, I've got to
find your sister right away.

391
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,522
If the cops pick her up
she'll forfeit her bond.

392
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:49,026
Did you check her room?

393
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:51,094
Which one's her room?

394
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,764
She shares a room with Caroline.

395
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:58,001
Room 119. Rooof!

396
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:00,537
You all look alike?

397
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,440
So how can I tell who's who?

398
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:05,642
Well, we can always tell.

399
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:08,912
Even identical twins
aren't entirely identical.

400
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:12,716
Georgia has three
freckles by her left eye.

401
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:17,387
And I have this nice
mole right here.

402
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:23,093
And an even nicer
one right here.

403
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,665
Room 119. Right?

404
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:30,467
Yeah!

405
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,335
Caroline wears glasses.

406
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:35,405
We all need them but
she actually wears them.

407
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:39,409
Do you want to see my glasses?

408
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:42,012
Maybe some other time.

409
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:15,912
I need to speak
with Georgia Almond,

410
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:19,850
She's not in here right now.

411
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:34,397
I've got to find Georgia

412
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:35,932
before the judge
gets really upset

413
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:39,436
and revokes her bail.

414
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,771
Georgia didn't do it.

415
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:42,706
Georgia was in here with me

416
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:44,741
all night when Dakota died.

417
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:45,775
We didn't find out about Dakota

418
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:47,310
getting hit by that trash truck

419
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:50,347
until the next morning.

420
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:58,088
The police think Dakota
was also shot in the head.

421
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:06,863
That's why they think
it was a murder.

422
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:08,465
Yeah!

423
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,901
They say they found
Georgia's little gun

424
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:13,670
under the corner
of the dumpster.

425
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:17,541
Like somebody wanted
it to get found.

426
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:23,280
Like why wouldn't the killer

427
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:28,185
just toss it in the
dumpster with the garbage.

428
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:29,886
You know Dakota was killed

429
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:33,390
because she wasn't going
to share the jackpot.

430
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:42,432
The lotto jackpot?

431
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:45,001
Dakota won the big one?

432
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:46,169
Yeah!

433
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:48,438
The whole family
plays that silly game,

434
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,940
except for me.

435
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:52,375
If somebody wins a little
something they split it up.

436
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:56,313
The winner gets more of course.

437
00:37:00,752 --> 00:37:02,552
I'll bet you were
a little chafed

438
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:06,456
about not getting your
cut of the jackpot.

439
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,529
I don't get a cut.

440
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:15,966
I don't play that stupid game.

441
00:37:15,968 --> 00:37:17,500
Sure!

442
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,604
Dakota wins the big one

443
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,673
and decides not to divide it up.

444
00:37:23,675 --> 00:37:24,908
Dakota and Georgia
wanted to move

445
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,343
to Oregon and buy a dairy farm.

446
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:28,511
They said we could
all move out there too

447
00:37:28,513 --> 00:37:31,815
and help with the cows.

448
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,355
Dakota likes cows?

449
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:41,057
She likes the idea of cows

450
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,192
Dairy cows

451
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:44,094
She likes the idea of cows

452
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:46,229
eating grass on sunny hills

453
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,431
and making milk from it.

454
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:52,802
I don't think she's ever
milked a cow before.

455
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:55,712
Georgia likes the
idea of cows too?

456
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:57,642
Yeah!

457
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,610
But it was going
to take everything,

458
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:05,015
like the whole jackpot
to buy the farm.

459
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:10,387
So Dakota and Georgia

460
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,690
decide to keep
the whole jackpot?

461
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,061
Dairy farms in
Oregon aren't cheap.

462
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:21,431
Mother says we're
staying right here.

463
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,447
Mother wants to use the winnings

464
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:25,869
to buy this Motor Court.

465
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:28,471
I don't ever play the lottery

466
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:32,208
so I guess I'd have to
be a guest and pay rent.

467
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:39,449
Were you going
out to Oregon too?

468
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:52,362
Yeah! I guess so.

469
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,900
Dakota was my best friend,

470
00:38:56,902 --> 00:39:00,403
and I really love Georgia too.

471
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:03,473
I figure they have
books in Oregon

472
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:07,310
but I sure don't dream about
messing around with cows.

473
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:10,547
You know where Georgia is now?

474
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:13,750
Georgia said her
stomach was upset.

475
00:39:13,752 --> 00:39:16,619
She wanted some ginger root tea.

476
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:19,589
I figure she went over
to Elizabeth's room.

477
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:24,160
What number is that?

478
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,995
It's room 333.

479
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:29,399
But you'll have
to hold your nose.

480
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,214
It's my boyfriend, Cain.

481
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:48,451
He's not feeling too good.

482
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:53,323
Tongue piercing went bad.

483
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:58,395
He doesn't look too sporty.

484
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:02,298
His disability check
comes in today.

485
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,235
But after that, he's
out of here. OK!

486
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:08,104
Hey! I'm just a
skip tracer lady.

487
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:12,942
I'm only looking for Georgia.

488
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,811
She's here man.

489
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:18,014
She's really here.

490
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,950
We're all here.

491
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:26,022
This is it man.

492
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:29,726
This is it?

493
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:33,229
The center of the universe.

494
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:36,099
We're all here!

495
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,101
Right now, man.

496
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,669
Oh gee!

497
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:43,940
I've got to find your
sister so I can help her.

498
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:46,176
A question.

499
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:52,515
A cosmic inquiry.

500
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,602
My sister! My friend!

501
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:17,140
Bonds we keep! chances we take.

502
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:22,278
Stars and celestial objects
in the voids of the infinity.

503
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:42,365
It's a hairball!

504
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:48,004
Not just any hairball.

505
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,942
It's Peter's hair ball.

506
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:56,079
Peter?

507
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,848
Peter the cat

508
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,252
died puking up this hairball.

509
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:05,522
Peter can answer your questions.

510
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:10,126
Yeah! Where is
Georgia right now?

511
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:36,653
Cat howling.

512
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:41,558
Cat hiss!

513
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:45,662
Cat howling

514
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,203
Cat spits

515
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:08,284
Georgia is with mother.

516
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:12,522
She's in there man!

517
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:16,559
She's been there all along.

518
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:21,264
Georgia sits in the bathroom.

519
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,533
Georgia sits in the bathroom?

520
00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:26,636
She sits in there man.

521
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:29,839
She reads in there.

522
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,342
Mother says she sits
in there all night

523
00:43:32,344 --> 00:43:34,544
and sleeps in there.

524
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:37,914
Georgia sleeps in the bathroom?

525
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:40,650
She's been there all along.

526
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:45,788
Jeepers creepers! I
should've guessed!

527
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,293
Jumpers always
run back to Momma.

528
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:15,084
Mother's got a gun!

529
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:19,122
You're not going
anywhere with that man.

530
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:20,790
Georgia?

531
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,995
Mother! What are you
doing with that gun?

532
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:29,732
You're not taking her
anywhere Mister bounty hunter.

533
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:31,167
Not a bounty hunter.

534
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:34,037
I'm a skip tracer.

535
00:44:34,039 --> 00:44:38,641
I have tried to raise
these girls right.

536
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:41,778
Like a rat eating
an onion I've tried.

537
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,848
Momma! You did the
best you could.

538
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,316
They didn't have a daddy.

539
00:44:47,318 --> 00:44:49,719
I had to be their
momma and their daddy.

540
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:53,456
And teach them to
share and share alike.

541
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,726
This skip hunter isn't taking

542
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:59,362
my little girl down for
something she didn't do.

543
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:05,868
I did it!

544
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:10,139
I shot Dakota that night
out by the dumpster.

545
00:45:11,976 --> 00:45:13,743
Momma!

546
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:16,779
You shot Dakota.

547
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:18,314
Why?

548
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:20,917
She wasn't going to share.

549
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:23,519
I had to teach you girls,

550
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:26,089
you all need to learn to share.

551
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:28,491
There's nothing to share.

552
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:30,760
This ticket's no good.

553
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:32,028
What?

554
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,297
Dakota didn't read
the numbers right.

555
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:36,232
She confused a
five with an eight.

556
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:39,602
Needs glasses! We all do.

557
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:48,711
It doesn't matter to
me who shot Dakota.

558
00:45:50,014 --> 00:45:53,716
I just need to get Georgia
in front of the judge today.

559
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:18,307
I guess I should ride along
and talk to that judge myself.

560
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:22,879
You can if you like.

561
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:27,984
He'll make you get a lawyer.

562
00:47:09,761 --> 00:47:11,627
You must strap the patients down

563
00:47:11,629 --> 00:47:15,398
to keep them from
hurting themselves.

564
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:19,202
Exchanging brains
can be somewhat

565
00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:21,304
violent.

566
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:23,139
I never get violent.

567
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:26,075
I can always control myself.

568
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:30,980
I would be delighted
to personally

569
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:35,985
wire you up and strap you down.

570
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:38,287
I'm certain my
personal assistant,

571
00:47:38,289 --> 00:47:40,756
Mr. Homm, can manage it.

572
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:42,758
I can manage it.

573
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:45,528
Ms. Bird

574
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:49,031
this very instrument

575
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:50,867
is the prototype
for the next wave

576
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,401
of identity theft.

577
00:47:52,403 --> 00:47:53,636
The British Navy's Q Branch

578
00:47:53,638 --> 00:47:56,606
considers this Brain
Interface Machine

579
00:47:56,608 --> 00:47:57,874
to be one of the

580
00:47:57,876 --> 00:47:59,442
most dangerous weapons
it's ever tested.

581
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:00,843
They consider it to be

582
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:05,581
the ultimate tool
for identity theft.

583
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:16,659
Are you planning to
steal someone's identity?

584
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:20,663
My company, Ostrich
Publishing is very big.

585
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:24,600
But it's only the
second biggest.

586
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,170
Big Dipper Publishing
is the biggest.

587
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:31,474
I need to know about
their next best seller

588
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,409
before it hits the shelves.

589
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,212
A young editor
over at Big Dipper

590
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:37,813
has agreed to

591
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:39,582
work with us.

592
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:41,150
So!

593
00:48:41,152 --> 00:48:44,086
You're going to
implant your brain

594
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:46,989
into a young woman's

595
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:48,325
body!

596
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,394
A double agent you
can trust completely.

597
00:48:51,996 --> 00:48:53,296
I never trust anyone.

598
00:48:53,298 --> 00:48:54,497
That is why I

599
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:57,433
am more successful
than everyone.

600
00:48:57,902 --> 00:49:00,803
Oh! By the way

601
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:03,539
Doctor Skipfly

602
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:09,445
Mr. Homm did ask about
your special spray?

603
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:15,117
I do market this spray
I formulated myself.

604
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,686
It's instantaneous
and untraceable.

605
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:21,824
It can kill a raging
bear dead in its tracks.

606
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:24,827
I can let you have this one

607
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,028
because you're
already purchasing

608
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,397
the Brain Machine.

609
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,570
Mr. Homm.

610
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:37,907
Test the sprayer on the Doctor.

611
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:39,141
What?

612
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:49,151
[TV screams]

613
00:50:33,097 --> 00:50:36,966
Thank you for meeting
us in this place

614
00:50:36,968 --> 00:50:39,902
Miss Sylvia Bunch.

615
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:45,074
Please call me Sylvia.

616
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:46,809
Everyone always
calls me Ms. Bird.

617
00:50:46,811 --> 00:50:49,378
You've met Mr. Homm before.

618
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,714
Only on the phone.

619
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:54,050
Mr. Homm said that you

620
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:55,584
want to borrow my identity

621
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:57,453
so you can see some
of Big Dipper's

622
00:50:57,455 --> 00:50:59,555
current projects for yourself.

623
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,757
When you spoke to Mr. Homm.

624
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,459
You said something

625
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:05,127
about your Mother being ill.

626
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:07,997
That's why you need the money.

627
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:10,800
Yes, my Mother has cancer

628
00:51:10,802 --> 00:51:14,603
with just a few
short weeks to live.

629
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:17,973
Her only hope is a

630
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:22,411
very expensive
experimental treatment.

631
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:26,415
You have to understand

632
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:28,784
I really am desperate
for the money

633
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:30,519
or I would never do

634
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:32,955
this awful thing to Big Dipper.

635
00:51:32,957 --> 00:51:35,825
I also have a mother.

636
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,861
That is why I'm
so understanding.

637
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:42,465
Did Mr. Homm tell you how I plan

638
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,233
to use your identity
to gain access

639
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:46,235
to Big Dipper's Boardroom?

640
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:49,205
No. He just said you have the

641
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:50,406
latest technology

642
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:52,975
for using my identity.

643
00:51:52,977 --> 00:51:54,443
Homm!

644
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:57,913
Show her the Brain Machine.

645
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:13,796
Oh Wow!

646
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:16,732
Mr. Homm will connect us up

647
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:19,001
to this little
piece of technology

648
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:22,338
and it will simply
swap our brains.

649
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:25,307
You will become me and

650
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:27,343
I will become

651
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:28,777
you.

652
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:30,279
Do I need to sign

653
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:32,681
some kind of contract
or something?

654
00:52:32,683 --> 00:52:34,850
On my! No!

655
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:35,784
What we are doing here

656
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:39,522
is entirely beyond the law.

657
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:43,425
My cash is my contract.

658
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:49,765
I'm ready to get started

659
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:52,001
Now! Miss Bunch.

660
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:54,336
I'm fine.

661
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,939
Just a little nervous I guess.

662
00:52:56,941 --> 00:52:57,973
I never get nervous.

663
00:52:57,975 --> 00:52:59,975
If I do, I immediately remember

664
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:01,911
that I am much too important

665
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:04,780
to get nervous.

666
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:07,850
Homm! Hook us up now.

667
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:22,798
Homm! Her hair is going to
interfere with the wires.

668
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:24,466
You need to shave her.

669
00:53:24,468 --> 00:53:25,901
No! Wait!

670
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:28,070
That is going to be my hair.

671
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:30,706
The hair is fine Homm.

672
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:32,808
Leave it alone.

673
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:47,723
I wonder what kind of
nasty little people

674
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:49,792
have sat in this old thing?

675
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:02,805
Ok! I'm comfortable now.

676
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:04,807
No! Wait!

677
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:09,678
Let me just sit up
a little bit more.

678
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:25,995
Homm!

679
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:30,766
Can't you loop these
wires off my face.

680
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:39,808
I can control myself
without those.

681
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:53,055
I am not at all
nervous about this.

682
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:56,725
I'm much too important
to get nervous.

683
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:58,160
Screams

684
00:54:58,162 --> 00:55:00,796
[electrical volts raging]

685
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,292
[ding]

686
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,324
[bass drop]

687
00:56:14,372 --> 00:56:16,505
Saa-a-ay?

688
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:20,442
Homm!

689
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:24,847
Get me off this floor.

690
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:40,562
These clothes are horrid!

691
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,731
Straight off the
department store rack.

692
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,767
I should've made
that girl change

693
00:56:44,769 --> 00:56:48,837
into something more
suitable for me.

694
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,852
Ugh!

695
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,055
My teeth need to be whitened.

696
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:09,725
I'm going to have to get
them done right away.

697
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:13,862
I just can't be seen
with these yellow teeth.

698
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:20,402
Well Homm!

699
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:23,038
What do you think?

700
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,140
About what?

701
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,276
About me!

702
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:30,746
What do you think
about the new me?

703
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:32,781
Depends on who you are.

704
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,650
I'm Phoebe!

705
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:35,984
Phoebe Bird!

706
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:37,119
Of course

707
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:39,721
I'm the new Phoebe Bird

708
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:41,256
in a younger body.

709
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:44,693
A body that's more my age.

710
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:46,195
Well?

711
00:57:46,197 --> 00:57:49,064
You do look younger.

712
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:50,499
Younger and more attractive

713
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:52,601
don't you think?

714
00:57:53,204 --> 00:57:55,270
You look younger.

715
00:57:55,272 --> 00:57:56,205
Now!

716
00:57:56,207 --> 00:57:59,675
You can tell me you love me.

717
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:02,211
I know you've always loved me.

718
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:06,215
I have always
liked you Ms. Bird.

719
00:58:06,217 --> 00:58:08,150
You love me Homm.

720
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:11,954
Just say it!

721
00:58:11,956 --> 00:58:15,190
I love you Ms. Bird.

722
00:58:15,926 --> 00:58:18,393
I could be in love with you too.

723
00:58:18,395 --> 00:58:19,962
You know,

724
00:58:19,964 --> 00:58:25,100
I've always admired
your young, strong body!

725
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,135
You know,

726
00:58:27,137 --> 00:58:30,639
I only surround
myself with the best.

727
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:33,342
Thank you Ms. Bird.

728
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,521
Whoah!

729
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:53,662
Did it work?

730
00:58:53,664 --> 00:58:55,397
It worked!

731
00:58:55,399 --> 00:58:58,033
It worked perfectly.

732
00:59:06,877 --> 00:59:08,677
I see you made it.

733
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,078
I made it great.

734
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,280
I knew I would.

735
00:59:11,282 --> 00:59:14,483
I always come through
everything great.

736
00:59:14,485 --> 00:59:16,084
It's like I'm talking

737
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,655
to myself in some weird mirror.

738
00:59:22,826 --> 00:59:26,562
It looks like I've
gained a few years.

739
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:27,829
It's no problem.

740
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:29,064
I'll get used to it.

741
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,967
You won't have to
get used to it.

742
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:33,468
We might as well move on

743
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,837
to the next phase of our plan.

744
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,139
Mr. Homm!

745
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:38,141
Huh?

746
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:38,874
Homm!

747
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:40,909
What's your problem now?

748
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:42,444
I don't know.

749
00:59:42,446 --> 00:59:43,879
I think you need to turn

750
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:46,448
that little green
valve on the tip.

751
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,649
I knew that!

752
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:49,251
These things aren't
rocket science.

753
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:49,885
[spray]

754
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,220
Ugh!

755
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:54,690
Well!

756
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,260
He shouldn't have got
his face in the spray.

757
00:59:58,862 --> 01:00:01,830
This was meant for me.

758
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:09,705
Now that you've
stolen a younger body.

759
01:00:09,707 --> 01:00:10,872
My body!

760
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:13,442
You were just going
to discard me.

761
01:00:13,444 --> 01:00:14,543
Weren't you?

762
01:00:14,545 --> 01:00:17,713
I'm much too
important to get old.

763
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:20,816
Ms. Bird.

764
01:00:21,518 --> 01:00:24,086
You have indeed stolen my body.

765
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,687
Unfortunately for you

766
01:00:25,689 --> 01:00:27,122
it isn't the lease on life

767
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:29,024
you were expecting.

768
01:00:29,026 --> 01:00:30,459
Everyone needs me.

769
01:00:30,461 --> 01:00:32,961
I can't get old.

770
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:36,231
My mother wasn't
dying of cancer.

771
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:38,033
I was.

772
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:41,670
It's in that body
you've stolen from me.

773
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:44,206
You have cancer.

774
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,407
Cancer?

775
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:47,809
What cancer?

776
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:52,080
The doctors only gave
me few weeks to live.

777
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:55,984
You are going to need these.

778
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:59,655
Probably all of them
and more before the end.

779
01:00:59,657 --> 01:01:03,125
I can't die. Not me!

780
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:06,194
I really was desperate
for that money.

781
01:01:06,196 --> 01:01:07,162
My last ditch hope

782
01:01:07,164 --> 01:01:08,664
was that experimental treatment.

783
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:12,434
But I really didn't think
it was going to work.

784
01:01:13,504 --> 01:01:17,205
I was going die of the
cancer in a few weeks

785
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:20,442
just like the doctors said.

786
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,514
That machine!

787
01:01:26,417 --> 01:01:29,551
I have to switch back.

788
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:34,022
I must have my body
back this instant.

789
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:38,860
You can't just let me
die from your cancer.

790
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:42,364
Oh! I can.

791
01:02:57,307 --> 01:03:02,110
So, Sid. Why'd you
want Bettylou killed?

792
01:03:02,913 --> 01:03:07,716
Child support, custody, alimony?

793
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:11,019
None of those.

794
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:12,954
It's the dog.

795
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:15,857
She got the dog.

796
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,660
I really loved the dog.

797
01:03:19,263 --> 01:03:22,364
The dog would do it.

798
01:03:23,834 --> 01:03:27,302
You're going to kill
her tonight? Right?

799
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:30,806
How're you going do it?

800
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:35,377
Don't worry about it.

801
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,848
Your Ex is supposed to pick
me up in a couple hours

802
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:44,352
to take me for my
physical therapy.

803
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:49,958
I heard you've done this
sort of thing before.

804
01:03:50,561 --> 01:03:51,693
You're a pro. Right?

805
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:53,628
There won't be any problem?

806
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:58,466
Listen Sid! I've got the best training
available. I'm very experienced.

807
01:03:58,468 --> 01:04:03,605
I used to work for the US army in Iraq.
That's where I got hurt.

808
01:04:05,242 --> 01:04:07,776
You got shot in Iraq?

809
01:04:08,879 --> 01:04:11,012
Naw. Didn't get shot.

810
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:16,785
My buddy and I got drunk and
were riding around in a truck

811
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:22,490
looking for somebody to kill.

812
01:04:23,961 --> 01:04:27,162
He drove the truck
into a big rock.

813
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:30,765
But you been killing
people since Iraq?

814
01:04:31,235 --> 01:04:32,868
Not really.

815
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:38,106
Mostly give guitar lessons
and sell stuff I find.

816
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:39,841
Oh!... Hmm?

817
01:04:44,047 --> 01:04:47,148
Have you killed
anybody since Iraq?

818
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:50,191
I been trying to work
my way back into it.

819
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:09,037
I don't know Four-Eyes. If you
haven't killed anybody in that long

820
01:05:09,973 --> 01:05:13,208
you might've lost your touch.

821
01:05:13,944 --> 01:05:16,544
Hey! I still got the touch. OK!

822
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:20,593
Just last month I killed that old
bag outside the title pawn shop.

823
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:23,351
I heard about that.

824
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:28,123
I heard it was an accident.

825
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:31,893
It wasn't an accident. I did it.

826
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:37,666
I hated that mean old chicken headed lady.
She'd repo your car if you were

827
01:05:37,668 --> 01:05:41,403
two minutes late on your payment.
Was she going to take yours?

828
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:45,240
No. My wheelchair.

829
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:48,710
She had the title and I
couldn't make the payment.

830
01:05:48,712 --> 01:05:51,079
Like what was I supposed to do?

831
01:05:51,081 --> 01:05:55,216
I'm like, going through a dry
spell in the music business.

832
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:58,787
Kids just don't want
to play guitar anymore.

833
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:02,857
How'd you kill her?

834
01:06:07,197 --> 01:06:12,334
I backed her into one of those big
dryers in that laundry-mat she runs.

835
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:17,639
Locked her in.

836
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:23,478
Put in some dimes.

837
01:06:25,882 --> 01:06:29,384
Sizzzzzzz

838
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:31,252
Hee hee!

839
01:06:34,024 --> 01:06:36,324
How many dimes?

840
01:06:38,895 --> 01:06:42,998
Oh... four or five I guess.

841
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:50,505
Like I said, guitar lessons

842
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:55,310
are running a little
thin these days.

843
01:06:56,046 --> 01:06:58,246
Four or five dimes would do it.

844
01:06:58,248 --> 01:06:59,714
So!

845
01:07:01,585 --> 01:07:04,285
You bring your gun today?

846
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:07,088
Had to hock my gun.

847
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:12,227
But don't worry! I'll
think of something.

848
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:18,733
Maybe...

849
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:23,705
Maybe, maybe I could
choke the victim.

850
01:07:23,707 --> 01:07:28,443
You know! Really! Crush her windpipe
if I can get her down on the floor.

851
01:07:28,779 --> 01:07:30,645
Argh!

852
01:07:33,116 --> 01:07:36,684
That sounds like it might work.

853
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:38,319
One thing...

854
01:07:40,090 --> 01:07:44,392
You could suggest she tie you up.
Bettylou loves to tie and be tied.

855
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:50,632
I don't know.

856
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:53,068
How am I supposed to choke her

857
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,103
if I'm all tied up?

858
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:57,205
You're not the one
getting tied up.

859
01:07:59,009 --> 01:08:02,177
That's just what you say. Bettylou
will insist on being tied up first.

860
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:10,552
Trust me, I've been there.
She'll want to go first.

861
01:08:11,955 --> 01:08:16,758
I don't know. I don't have any
ropes or that sort of thing.

862
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,628
You don't need rope.
Use the pillow cases.

863
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,731
You get burns from rope anyway.

864
01:08:24,468 --> 01:08:26,267
So, so let me get this straight.

865
01:08:27,304 --> 01:08:31,506
I need to tie her up
with the pillow cases?

866
01:08:32,242 --> 01:08:35,543
Like, while she's on the bed?

867
01:08:36,012 --> 01:08:37,879
No big deal.

868
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:41,716
We'll do a dry run
and I'll show you.

869
01:08:43,987 --> 01:08:47,722
Just twist it up a little.
Like this

870
01:08:49,092 --> 01:08:52,961
No you're twisting it up too much.
You don't want it so tight.

871
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:56,764
If it's too tight you
can't make any good knots.

872
01:08:57,801 --> 01:09:00,068
That's it.
Now put a wrap around my wrist.

873
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:03,238
Tie me to the bedpost.

874
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,040
This beds awful shaky.

875
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:09,344
It's not gonna hold anybody.

876
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:12,247
It only has to hold her long
enough to choke her. Ok.

877
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:16,151
Now do my other
wrist the same way.

878
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:20,155
I don't know man.
I'm not feeling this.

879
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:23,825
It's going to work. Trust me.

880
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:27,295
This old bed's not
designed for this.

881
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:30,965
It's made out of steel tubing.
It'll hold up fine.

882
01:09:36,406 --> 01:09:40,775
I need to take off your boots
to tie your legs down.

883
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:44,145
Not for this job you don't. When
her hands are tied like this,

884
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:48,383
you got enough advantage to
jump up on her and choke her.

885
01:09:49,486 --> 01:09:52,020
I don't know.
Now that I think about it,

886
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:54,889
I don't think I've ever
choked anyone before.

887
01:09:55,358 --> 01:09:56,858
You'll be fine.

888
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,827
You've got strong hands from
maneuvering that chair around.

889
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:03,298
Just crush her
windpipe like you said.

890
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:07,835
How come you don't just
do this thing yourself.

891
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:11,005
Like, you could save
yourself a thousand bucks.

892
01:10:11,007 --> 01:10:13,675
And you'd be the only
one who knew about it.

893
01:10:15,478 --> 01:10:18,713
There's always more problems when
more people are involved in a crime.

894
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:21,449
Like I said, I've been there.

895
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:24,252
Once I tie her up,
I'm in her power.

896
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:28,456
Then I'd let her tie me up. Then I'm
right back to giving her the dog.

897
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:35,029
I'd be better off smothering
her. Like with the pillow.

898
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:40,034
That way I wouldn't have to
see her face or anything.

899
01:10:41,104 --> 01:10:44,105
It's not the same thing
as shooting somebody.

900
01:10:45,175 --> 01:10:47,442
Man, you've got to untie
me. I've got to split.

901
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:51,012
Yep! Argh!

902
01:10:51,848 --> 01:10:55,216
I need to smother the victim

903
01:10:55,218 --> 01:10:57,685
With the pillow.

904
01:10:58,288 --> 01:10:59,787
Whatever! Untie me

905
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:02,890
so I can pay you and be gone
before Bettylou gets here.

906
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:08,029
Oh, we've got plenty of time. She
couldn't be on time to her own funeral.

907
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:09,631
Let me go!

908
01:11:09,966 --> 01:11:10,966
Argh!

909
01:11:11,568 --> 01:11:12,568
Whuff!

910
01:11:14,204 --> 01:11:16,404
You brought all
the money with you?

911
01:11:16,406 --> 01:11:18,673
You think I'm an idiot.

912
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:21,075
Don't worry about paying me.

913
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:23,978
I'll grab the cash
on my way out.

914
01:11:24,314 --> 01:11:25,446
Whuff!

915
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:29,784
I'm limiting exposure
to witnesses.

916
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:32,053
Whiff!

917
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:33,389
Argh!

918
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:36,891
The hit man's not
like the yard man.

919
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:41,262
He doesn't just go away
after the grass is mowed.

920
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:42,631
Argh!

921
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,442
Argh!

922
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:19,534
I'm ready to be
tied up Bettylou.

923
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:21,869
Oooo! Ahh! Four Eyes.

924
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:25,807
You know you're supposed
to tie me up first.

925
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:32,039
Eighteen a night.
Extra towels are extra.

926
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:33,975
Phone's not working.

927
01:13:33,977 --> 01:13:39,113
Maybe the lightning zapped em.

928
01:13:39,716 --> 01:13:42,250
Happens all the time.

929
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:46,888
Cell-phones around here
quit when it's raining.

930
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,523
Say!

931
01:13:50,693 --> 01:13:55,830
You young ladies look like you could do with a
little something to take the edge off the storm.

932
01:14:01,070 --> 01:14:02,937
Moonshine!

933
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:04,472
Cool.

934
01:14:05,074 --> 01:14:07,208
Two dollars. Solid coin.

935
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:11,679
Zoe?

936
01:14:14,017 --> 01:14:17,118
Plus eighteen for the room.

937
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:21,022
Solid coin. No Giga-Coin.

938
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:35,269
Can't register
ya'all till tomorrow.

939
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:38,706
If I can remember.

940
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:42,543
Don't worry about it.

941
01:14:43,913 --> 01:14:48,049
Bad memory's part of my charm.

942
01:15:14,911 --> 01:15:20,047
I love this little place.
It's like going back in time.

943
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,118
Pre-Liberation at least.

944
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:28,589
Like, in the old days when people
brought their men in here.

945
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:31,192
More of your deviant fantasies.

946
01:15:32,462 --> 01:15:36,397
So! I'm deviant! You know,
I've always liked men.

947
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:40,368
Zoe! You don't like men.
You've never even seen a man.

948
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:44,639
Doesn't keep me
from liking them.

949
01:15:46,409 --> 01:15:51,245
There aren't any men to
like. Men are extinct.

950
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:57,218
I like them anyway.

951
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:04,659
Men are the reason for all for the bad
things that have happened in the old world.

952
01:16:04,661 --> 01:16:07,628
Men are evil.

953
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:25,546
We'll explore the
Pain Pleasure Paradox.

954
01:16:26,683 --> 01:16:28,916
Pain...

955
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:34,455
Precedes pleasure.

956
01:16:49,739 --> 01:16:54,141
Eighteen a night.
Extra towels are extra.

957
01:16:54,877 --> 01:16:56,544
We're Agents of the Server!

958
01:16:57,647 --> 01:17:01,015
Oh, oh, yes sirs!
How may I help you?

959
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:03,784
We need a room.

960
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:12,360
Well, I can give you a
discount. A very good discount.

961
01:17:13,663 --> 01:17:16,430
I think you'll do better
that a discount Grandmother.

962
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:22,670
Yes sir! I can do better.

963
01:17:22,672 --> 01:17:27,808
Rooms for Agents of the
Server are complementary.

964
01:17:28,544 --> 01:17:31,445
Grandmother! You own this motel?

965
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:35,516
I'm Gamma Class. I
don't own anything.

966
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:41,789
Of course not. Your family might have
owned it. Back before the liberation.

967
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:49,997
It was in my family
when I was little girl.

968
01:17:51,034 --> 01:17:54,168
That was a long time
ago, grandmother.

969
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:58,406
Back when there were... men.

970
01:17:59,976 --> 01:18:03,744
You haven't aged
well grandmother.

971
01:18:04,747 --> 01:18:08,082
You were supposed to
be repurposed at sixty.

972
01:18:09,052 --> 01:18:11,652
I'm fifty-eight.
It's on the Server.

973
01:18:11,654 --> 01:18:12,987
Sure!

974
01:18:14,023 --> 01:18:16,791
The Server's down. We
can't review your file.

975
01:18:16,793 --> 01:18:18,392
Sixty's the limit Grandma.

976
01:18:18,394 --> 01:18:21,929
Please! I'm not that old.

977
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:26,067
Too bad grandma! So sad!

978
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,782
Looks like you've got some foil
under your phone Grandma huh?

979
01:18:41,784 --> 01:18:46,921
Oh, sorry sir! The strap!
It, it was itching me.

980
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:50,725
Yeah, right! You were itching to
run down your cell-phone battery!

981
01:18:50,727 --> 01:18:54,528
There are more interesting
things about grandmother.

982
01:18:54,530 --> 01:18:58,466
Much more interesting that
the dead battery in her phone.

983
01:18:59,502 --> 01:19:04,004
No sir! There's nothing
interesting about me.

984
01:19:04,006 --> 01:19:05,773
Nothing interesting at all!

985
01:19:05,775 --> 01:19:10,911
Sometimes Gamma Class Non-Persons
can be most interesting.

986
01:19:11,514 --> 01:19:14,148
Don't you think Coppel?

987
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:16,550
Very interesting indeed.

988
01:19:16,552 --> 01:19:20,488
No sir! There's
nothing about me.

989
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:24,759
I'm only a Gamma Class!
I'm not even a citizen.

990
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:35,069
I think we're going to find out just
how interesting Grandmother really is.

991
01:19:53,656 --> 01:19:57,191
Grandmother knows
something interesting.

992
01:19:58,227 --> 01:20:02,897
She may even know about
deviants staying here.

993
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:06,267
I think we need to
play a little game.

994
01:20:09,372 --> 01:20:12,373
Let's take a walk!

995
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:16,310
Have a seat Grandma!

996
01:20:19,549 --> 01:20:22,650
There's nothing to be afraid of.

997
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:25,186
The truth will set you free.

998
01:20:42,104 --> 01:20:44,705
Don't you just love this Alice!

999
01:20:44,707 --> 01:20:47,441
The Server doesn't
know where we are.

1000
01:20:48,511 --> 01:20:49,476
Like, it can't see
us or anything.

1001
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:52,479
The Server protects us.

1002
01:20:52,481 --> 01:20:56,083
If something bad were to happen
to us the Server could send help.

1003
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:57,551
Something did happen.

1004
01:20:57,553 --> 01:21:00,054
The Server went off-line.

1005
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,560
When the Server does come up it'll see
we're not at the fertility clinic.

1006
01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:11,131
I wish the Server would
go off-line forever.

1007
01:21:11,734 --> 01:21:14,068
Zoe! That's blasphemous!

1008
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:18,706
Alice, I don't want to get
pregnant at the fertility clinic.

1009
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:22,009
Everybody wants to get pregnant
at the fertility clinic.

1010
01:21:22,011 --> 01:21:23,811
It's a privilege.

1011
01:21:23,813 --> 01:21:28,949
Getting impregnated with a
turkey baster is no privilege.

1012
01:21:29,652 --> 01:21:31,752
That's how people get pregnant.

1013
01:21:32,488 --> 01:21:35,723
Or... a man could love me.

1014
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:45,399
That's ridiculous.
Men are obsolete,

1015
01:21:58,214 --> 01:22:00,481
Still off-line.

1016
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:31,211
It's a book!

1017
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:41,655
Whoa! It really is a book.

1018
01:22:45,161 --> 01:22:50,297
It's actually a book from
the old days of paper.

1019
01:22:58,941 --> 01:23:00,941
It's a Bible!

1020
01:23:07,783 --> 01:23:12,619
Playing Gin Rummy by
yourself Grandmother?

1021
01:23:14,090 --> 01:23:18,492
My little game, the truth game, is
much more entertaining than cards.

1022
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:24,164
Much more entertaining.

1023
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:28,168
Please! My file
is on the Server!

1024
01:23:28,904 --> 01:23:30,938
We can't access the Server.

1025
01:23:31,974 --> 01:23:34,575
However, we can
access the truth.

1026
01:23:35,878 --> 01:23:39,613
Unbutton your shirt grandma!

1027
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:43,017
No! Please! No!

1028
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:46,353
Put the wires on me.

1029
01:23:48,758 --> 01:23:51,091
Ms. Marx?

1030
01:23:52,128 --> 01:23:54,561
Please Penelope!
If you don't mind.

1031
01:24:02,405 --> 01:24:07,541
To do this property, you must
know exactly how it feels.

1032
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:10,077
Hook me up!

1033
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:26,994
Now, give it a crank.

1034
01:24:28,998 --> 01:24:31,765
I don't know Villa.

1035
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:33,901
Crank it!

1036
01:24:39,809 --> 01:24:42,776
What was that supposed to be?

1037
01:24:42,778 --> 01:24:45,345
I don't want to hurt you.

1038
01:24:45,347 --> 01:24:47,648
Crank that thing!

1039
01:24:59,462 --> 01:25:01,995
Villa! Are you alright?

1040
01:25:03,632 --> 01:25:07,334
I'm becoming
impatient Lieutenant

1041
01:25:07,937 --> 01:25:11,438
Light me up! Now!

1042
01:25:13,075 --> 01:25:15,209
I'm afraid.

1043
01:25:15,845 --> 01:25:19,780
My dear sweet Penelope.

1044
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:23,517
You really must get over that.

1045
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:31,525
No one does it like I do it.

1046
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:55,816
You need to get rid of that thing
before the Server sees you reading it.

1047
01:25:55,818 --> 01:25:57,384
Books are outlawed!

1048
01:25:59,088 --> 01:26:02,623
You need to turn that
thing into the authorities.

1049
01:26:04,093 --> 01:26:07,253
Maybe we can put it back in its
little hidey-hole where you found it.

1050
01:26:19,475 --> 01:26:22,309
Zoe! I thought you got
rid of that pencil.

1051
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:25,012
The Server could have you repurposed
for playing around with that thing.

1052
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:28,782
Chill out! The
Server can't see us.

1053
01:26:33,956 --> 01:26:37,758
I drew a picture of a man.

1054
01:26:39,662 --> 01:26:42,229
It looks like me!

1055
01:26:42,231 --> 01:26:43,931
Just in the face.

1056
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:45,499
You gave me parts!

1057
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:47,834
You gave me a dongle.

1058
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:51,104
Well yeah! I've never
seen a real man.

1059
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:57,044
It looks like...

1060
01:26:57,046 --> 01:26:58,745
A fish.

1061
01:27:02,818 --> 01:27:07,187
It didn't come out
exactly how I wanted.

1062
01:27:11,293 --> 01:27:16,163
When we left I time-lined all my friends
that we were going to be in Atlanta.

1063
01:27:16,165 --> 01:27:19,566
Everyone's going to
be worried about us.

1064
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:23,003
All those friends on your page.

1065
01:27:23,005 --> 01:27:25,672
You know they don't give
a flying rat about you.

1066
01:27:25,674 --> 01:27:30,077
They wouldn't even notice
if you never posted again.

1067
01:27:46,795 --> 01:27:50,330
I'm telling you the truth!

1068
01:27:50,332 --> 01:27:55,469
It's all my fault grandmother. I just
haven't asked the right questions.

1069
01:27:56,572 --> 01:28:00,374
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

1070
01:28:04,179 --> 01:28:07,381
I'm sure you will.

1071
01:28:11,954 --> 01:28:16,089
Do you have a man in here?

1072
01:28:16,091 --> 01:28:20,127
Like perhaps some old geezer who managed
to slighter away from the purge?

1073
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:38,812
There's no extra doors
in here grandmother?

1074
01:28:40,349 --> 01:28:43,850
No escape tunnels?

1075
01:28:47,056 --> 01:28:51,625
So! The old man is
still in here with us!

1076
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:55,862
Right under our noses!

1077
01:28:56,231 --> 01:28:58,065
A man?

1078
01:28:59,968 --> 01:29:03,670
Lieutenant! Your gun please.

1079
01:29:11,747 --> 01:29:16,883
A true leader never asks her subordinate
to do something she wouldn't do herself.

1080
01:29:23,492 --> 01:29:27,060
Please! I'll do anything!

1081
01:29:27,062 --> 01:29:29,196
Betray the man!

1082
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:57,991
Villa!

1083
01:30:00,396 --> 01:30:01,461
Villa!

1084
01:30:04,299 --> 01:30:05,332
Villa!

1085
01:30:05,667 --> 01:30:06,667
What!

1086
01:30:10,172 --> 01:30:14,341
What's your hurry
putting that thing on?

1087
01:30:14,343 --> 01:30:18,145
The battery. It
could use a charge.

1088
01:30:18,881 --> 01:30:20,747
It'll survive a little longer.

1089
01:30:22,184 --> 01:30:25,719
You know the Server can have us
repurposed for un-monitored intimacy.

1090
01:30:26,955 --> 01:30:31,425
Don't you just love how it
feels when we're totally alone?

1091
01:30:35,864 --> 01:30:37,864
Put your phone on.

1092
01:30:37,866 --> 01:30:40,267
No. It drains my life force.

1093
01:30:40,636 --> 01:30:41,468
Zoe!

1094
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:43,036
I don't want it on me.

1095
01:30:43,806 --> 01:30:45,739
Stop. You're going to break it.

1096
01:31:04,226 --> 01:31:06,560
It's the Whisky!

1097
01:31:07,563 --> 01:31:09,830
You don't know what you're
doing.

1098
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:12,098
Maybe.

1099
01:31:15,003 --> 01:31:18,138
Maybe I don't know
what I'm doing!

1100
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:46,967
Death by broken heart.

1101
01:31:50,873 --> 01:31:54,241
How did you know about that man?

1102
01:31:54,877 --> 01:31:56,943
I can smell them.

1103
01:31:58,046 --> 01:32:00,280
Makes the hair on
my neck prick up.

1104
01:32:00,849 --> 01:32:02,716
You can smell them?

1105
01:32:02,718 --> 01:32:04,317
They're like rats.

1106
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:05,452
Rats?

1107
01:32:11,593 --> 01:32:16,229
When you see one, there's
ten more you don't.

1108
01:32:17,533 --> 01:32:21,134
We need to check the
rest of the Motel rooms.

1109
01:33:26,501 --> 01:33:29,636
Agents of the
Server! Allow entry.

1110
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:55,662
We're investigating criminal
activity in this district.

1111
01:33:57,299 --> 01:34:00,667
I did it! I broke
the cell-phone.

1112
01:34:02,537 --> 01:34:05,739
Destruction of Server property.

1113
01:34:06,341 --> 01:34:07,874
Second-level felony.

1114
01:34:08,477 --> 01:34:09,142
Move it lieutenant.

1115
01:34:09,144 --> 01:34:11,544
We're not here for this.

1116
01:34:18,286 --> 01:34:22,355
Whuff! What's happening?

1117
01:34:26,194 --> 01:34:30,930
Alcohol! A drunken
Beta Class Citizen.

1118
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:32,832
What is it?

1119
01:34:46,948 --> 01:34:50,150
What are you people
doing to Alice?

1120
01:34:50,752 --> 01:34:53,019
Ms. Marx! I found this.

1121
01:34:56,091 --> 01:34:58,491
What is this trash?

1122
01:34:58,493 --> 01:35:02,962
This Beta Class Citizen was concealing
this contraband material, Sir.

1123
01:35:03,832 --> 01:35:05,165
Looks like

1124
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,100
A fish.

1125
01:35:10,739 --> 01:35:14,040
There's no men in here.
This is a dry hole.

1126
01:35:14,509 --> 01:35:16,209
Men? In here?

1127
01:35:21,116 --> 01:35:23,950
The paper's not yours, sister.

1128
01:35:23,952 --> 01:35:27,020
Neither is the phone.

1129
01:35:29,658 --> 01:35:32,058
It's my phone.

1130
01:35:34,629 --> 01:35:37,063
She was lying to protect you.

1131
01:35:37,666 --> 01:35:39,766
They're both guilty.

1132
01:35:54,149 --> 01:35:57,317
Just shoot them Coppel.

1133
01:35:59,688 --> 01:36:03,223
For only a second
level felony sir?

1134
01:36:03,692 --> 01:36:04,692
Well then

1135
01:36:05,227 --> 01:36:07,393
Just shoot one of them.

1136
01:36:28,617 --> 01:36:31,584
Pull the trigger Lieutenant.

1137
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:35,155
Now.

1138
01:36:43,732 --> 01:36:45,865
Now!
