1
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:16,343
Everyone would have emotional problems
when they are growing up

2
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,974
Come talk to us,

3
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,712
it just costs you a hundred
for a drink.

4
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:22,448
That includes a real
good chat,

5
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,046
go for it.

6
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:26,718
And that's the style of

7
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,693
''SOHO with love''.

8
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:31,526
l have my own car,
apartment and l am beautiful too...

9
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:34,533
men should chase
after me though.

10
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,798
l just want to find someone...

11
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,506
to have a spectacular
romance with me.

12
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:44,333
l sell insurance to my clients
for a life time guarantee.

13
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,073
And l do want to find someone...

14
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,615
who would fall in love with me
for a life time too.

15
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:52,582
There is something in your teeth.

16
00:00:52,652 --> 00:00:53,778
Really?

17
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:55,313
l can't get hard.

18
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,046
ln fact l'm not impotent,

19
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,750
l just can't make love
to my wife.

20
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,027
But l do have sexual desire
to other women.

21
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,291
Why does my boyfriend

22
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,126
bring me to see Keroro
movie every time?

23
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,689
And he always takes me to
Mcdonald or Kentucky for meal.

24
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:11,362
He won't go out with me unless
there comes the comic exhibition

25
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,066
Would you guys be
a bit mature?

26
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,835
Well, guys used to get
matured late.

27
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,672
l urge him to propose to me for
one hundred times before marrying him

28
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,782
because l want to have enough time
for us to think about it seriously.

29
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,787
And l do hope our relationship
will get better.

30
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,517
But, is it getting
even worse now?

31
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:34,420
He already proposed
to me for 96 times.

32
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:37,327
Whenever he buys me anything that
would be something that he likes

33
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,389
and he doesn't care
what l really want.

34
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,858
What do you want actually?

35
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,202
l am kind of falling
for a girl, but...

36
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,834
l don't know how to get
approach to her.

37
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:54,539
Have you ever gone
out with someone?

38
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,206
Of course l do.

39
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,347
And you are too coward.

40
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:04,385
She's rich, educated
and older than me...

41
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,893
You can still tell her that you
like her, if you don't...

42
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,720
she never know what
you are thinking about.

43
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,855
lf you do, maybe..

44
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,859
you will have the chance, huh?

45
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:15,161
Yeah.

46
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,202
That's right.

47
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,098
But l don't even know her.

48
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,540
Love is not rational,
you can't ask why

49
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:28,547
Otherwise that's not love.

50
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:33,882
Breaking up is like getting
a scar on the skin.

51
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:39,418
lt hurts at the beginning,
it'll be covered by the make-up.

52
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:45,221
As you look carefully,
it leaves a scar there.

53
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:57,470
l know they said l'm insane.

54
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:02,379
But someone says, only the insane
knows what love is.

55
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,916
One should indulge in love,
crazy about love

56
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,452
Otherwise that's not love.

57
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,249
Love Hurray

58
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,289
Feel much better now.

59
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,890
lt's getting hard to

60
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:19,421
find someone like you have the
patience to listen to my story

61
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,227
lt really worths it.

62
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,767
Thank you.

63
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,927
Save the money and
go to Beijing soon.

64
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,868
l know that, bye.

65
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,819
ls someone looking for you
two unlicensed psychiatrists?

66
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,221
What's up, doctor trainee?

67
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,348
What would you like to
talk about today?

68
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,792
l'd like to talk about the fact.

69
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,830
l think there should be
impact to life, failure...

70
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,389
no matter it's about
my career or love,

71
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,958
l will fix that up immediately,
no delay.

72
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,335
You two just listen to
stories of others,

73
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,498
does it work?

74
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,404
Hey, doc,

75
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,568
why do you keep
complaining tonight?

76
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,574
lt's okay,

77
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,669
he is going to
have an operation.

78
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:11,642
Why did you meet me here,
babe?

79
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,418
Are we gonna have dinner?

80
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,386
l'd like to talk to you.

81
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:16,752
Let's talk about during
dinner, let's go.

82
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,313
Let's break up then.

83
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,590
What did you say?

84
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,321
Joe Yeung, what did you say?

85
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,827
We have been together
for 6 months,

86
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,391
you suddenly want to
break up.

87
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,606
Why are you just sitting here?
Speak up!

88
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:38,433
Listen, our passion is gone.

89
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,976
Love will transform to sympathy
if we don't tackle it

90
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:44,882
l don't want to waste
our time.

91
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,945
ls it?

92
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,556
Some more water?

93
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,964
What's happening?

94
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,696
Operation fails.

95
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,536
You are so early,
where's Maggie?

96
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,003
What'd you like?

97
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,063
l am tackling it.

98
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,635
Honey, please marry me?

99
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,665
That's tacky.

100
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,711
This is the 97th time,
3 more left.

101
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,912
You did promise me,
don't eat your words.

102
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,482
Let's get something to eat
and go for an art show.

103
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,654
Sorry, girlfriend.

104
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,957
l have to dine with
my client tonight,

105
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,793
it's about the stock market.

106
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:42,630
That's a big client,
you have to go.

107
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,732
My girlfriend is
so considerate, so...

108
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,740
l have to marry her.

109
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,943
Bye!

110
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:56,971
What the hell!

111
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:58,812
How can someone blind doing
the delivery work?

112
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,819
Which restaurant are you in?
Who is your boss?

113
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:01,854
What is it?
What's your name?

114
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,751
Look at him!

115
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,084
The place is so messy...

116
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,886
You go ahead,
just leave it to me.

117
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,652
l am sorry...

118
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:07,624
You are in hurry.

119
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:08,853
l am terribly sorry...

120
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,395
Sorry about that,
Miss Ng...

121
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,161
lt's okay,
l will fix that.

122
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,724
l will fetch you
some new one.

123
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,607
What is love about!

124
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,735
Tell me...

125
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,144
Honey, he's up again.

126
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:30,205
There are so many
new singers,

127
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,712
l can't even identify them.

128
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,149
Everyone is gonna
sing love song.

129
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,743
Love song!

130
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,952
How many of them do really
know what love is about?

131
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,787
lf they don't, how can they have
the feeling in singing...

132
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,985
the true meaning of love,

133
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,860
the greatness of love,
the inscription of love.

134
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:50,662
They just never taste
the frustration of love.

135
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:52,596
What are you doing?

136
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,169
You srewed up
the delivery again?

137
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,643
lt's not my fault...the guy
bumped into me...

138
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:03,204
Sing... stop keep on
watching gals.

139
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,682
You should be devoted
in doing

140
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,219
delivery just like
having a romance.

141
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,585
You should learn to treasure
and getting involved.

142
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,717
Do you really
understand that?

143
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,803
You look great today.

144
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,566
What would you
like to have?

145

Same.

146
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,747
Do you know the girl

147
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,281
l haven't seen her before.

148
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,112
Which one?

149
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,746
The one in grey.

00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,742

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,300
Come on, marry me?

170
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,107
Are you going to check out the
furniture with me tonight?

Maybe you check it out yourself.

174
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:31,952
lf you want to buy anything just use

Yep.

237
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,157
Where are you going
for work?

238
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,027
There is a cafe in Soho,

239
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,033
called ''SOHO with love''

240
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:03,932
Do you know that?

241
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,868
You are that unlicensed
psychiatrist.

242
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:07,633
He's not licensed,
he'll soon be get caught.

243
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,071
Come here, l have quite
a lot to ask you.

244
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,369
Can you tell me something
about your cafe?

245
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,679
l have quite a lot to ask you,
come on.

246
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:18,375
You haven't ordered your drink,
what would you like?

247
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:25,955
What do you do
for a living?

248
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:27,253
l am an accountant.

249
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:28,486
What about Kelly?

250
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,686
She is still studying
in Canada.

251
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,453
Her cousin is getting
marry two weeks later,

252
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,997
she came back as
her bridemate.

253
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,089
She is leaving soon.

254
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,326
Hung.

255
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,963
Do you stll remember
Ko Bo Won?

256
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,270
She will get marry next year,
she invites you for the wedding banquet.

257
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,309
Really?

258
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,571
No way, l have to go back
to Beijing after X'mas.

259
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:48,510
My father wants me
to go back soon.

260
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,949
Are you going or not?

261
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,581
Probably, but l won't pay
much for the token.

262
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,144
Because Sung and l are saving money for
the tuition fee for studying in Beijing.

263
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:58,917
Not enough still?

264
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,219
lt would be much
for two of us.

265
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,193
Planning for two-year-saving,
but now...

266
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,422
the third year has passed.

267
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,656
How much in short?
Maybe l could lend it to you.

268
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:11,267
Hung, we want to
do it on our own.

269
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,370
On your own?

270
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,236
We don't want that,
just lend it to us.

271
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,274
Okay.

272
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,277
Too mild.

273
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,574
l will go and get some
more sugar.

274
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,609
Ching.

275
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,083
Hung is really nice,

276
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,016
just give him
one more chance.

277
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,679
Yeah, he is rich
and faithful.

278
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,722
lf l were you, l will like
be his mistress!

279
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,950
lf he likes me,
l will get sex change.

280
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,322
l will get sex change
to become his mistress.

281
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,587
Alright, as Hung comes out,

282
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,958
l will tell him about that.

283
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,560
ln fact l just want to
save enough money

284
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,699
and go to Beijing to study
with Sung as fast as we can.

285
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,427
The syrup.

286
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,998
Thanks.

287
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,629
How is it? Have you found
someone you love?

288
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:48,968
Not yet, do you have
any good guys for me?

289
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,167
Of course!

290
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,473
Guys in Beijing are
as good as Daniel Wu...

291
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:54,341
l want one too.

292
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,278
But a bit short,
four feet something.

293
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:58,549
But it is good though.

294
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:04,077
Let's back to the seat.

295
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,086
l leave now.
Ching may back home already

296
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:11,429
Okay.

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,656
Everybody, l back home first.

298
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,096
Bye.

299
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,564
Let's go.

300
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:57,603
lt is not good to drink coffee
at night.

301
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,106
lt is no good to hang out
so often either.

302
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,444
You have fun that night?

303
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:04,743
Which night?

304
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,041
The night after l left.

305
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,546
lt is more or less the same.

306
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,364
When should l call you?

307
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,734
Please give this to Sung.

308
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,103
Why didn't you give it to him
earlier tonight?

309
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,072
Just forget it.

310
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,807
l will give it to him.

311
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,106
Thanks a lot.

312
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,204
What's up?

313
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,182
You said it is not good
to drink coffee at night.

314
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:47,325
Where are you going?

315
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:48,689
Karaoke?

316
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,784
Okay.

00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,296

318
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,662
l am not going then,

319
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,563
Okay.

320
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,125

321
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:58,726
Call me.

322
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,601
Bye.

323
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,105
Should l take you home?
lt's so late.

324
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:07,434
Okay.

325
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:17,347
Time flies, it's been five years
since we broke up.

326
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,749
ls it?

327
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,156
l was too busy in my study and
not paying much attention to you.

328
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,693
Well, my father told me
to go back to Beijing.

329
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:27,231
You can come over
if you want to study there.

330
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,732
Hung, l just want to fulfill
my dream as soon as possible.

331
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:38,268
My dream is studing
in Beijing... with Sung.

332
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:46,643
Be careful.

333
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,587
Hi!

334
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,296
l wish you will fulfill your dream
for studying in Beijing very soon.

335
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,561

336
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,394

337
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,406

Happy?

339
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,237
How are your old classmates?

340
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,881
They are fine, they told me
to send you their regards...

341
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,653
Did Hung send me
his regard too?

342
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:23,913
You are jealous.

343
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:25,889
There is nothing between us.

344
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,755
That is fine, it would be
terrible if you do.

345
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,385
You are jealous.

346
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,559
Just take me as l am jealous.

347
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:36,665
What's up to you now?

348
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,896
What? l am fine.

349
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:41,905
Stop that.

350
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,442
l got nothing to do with this,
he held my hand so suddenly.

351
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,904
lt's okay.

352
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,807
You have come.

353
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,675
l've told you that l will.

354
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:51,908
Have a seat.

355
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,409
Why did you leave
so early that night?

356
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,348
Did that doctor give you
my phone number?

357
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,291
No.

358
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,753
What would you like to drink?

359
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,460
Apple juice, please.

360
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,556
OK.

361
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,927
Your girlfriend?

362
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,264
Yeah.

363
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,496
Having a quarrel?

364
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,303
Not quite just now but
l am not sure later on.

365
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,703
She is so cute.

366
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:22,437
But she will be terrible
as she lose her temper.

367
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:24,781
Apple juice.

368
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:36,787
l am gonna meet someone,
l have to go.

369
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:38,723
See you.

370
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,064
Leaving so soon?

371
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,561
Bye.

372
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,296
You said who is gonna
lose the temper?

373
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,937
That's not you.

374
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:48,862
Not me,

375
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,464
then you must have
another girlfriend.

376
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,477
l don't.

377
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,378
What's wrong with you?

378
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,074
You get mad as l went
to the gathering.

379
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,345
You went out with another
girl dishonourably,

380
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,544
can l get mad on that?

381
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:02,651
l went out for a drink
with Joe that night.

382
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:03,881
When?

383
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,422
The night of your classmates
gathering.

384
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,586
l told you everything

385
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,851
but you don't.

386
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,093
Hi, l am Fong Chi Ho.

387
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,691
l am not able to answer
your call right now,

388
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:52,794
Would you please leave
your name, number...

389
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,507
lf you not come back right now,
you needn't come back anymore.

390
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:04,606
Sent.

391
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,764
My leg is hurt.

392
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,404
Sing, what are you doing?
l am off.

393
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:48,492
Watch out, ...

394
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,991
You are maniac.

395
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,653
To go for rescue

396
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,798
Rescue? Rescue?
That's cool!

397
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,764
lsn't it too much, kid?

398
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:02,503
Firstly,

399
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,405
lt's not too much.

400
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,773
As l watched from outside,

401
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,175
l saw you lying
on the floor.

402
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:09,713
l don't know how much and
where you are hurt.

403
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,614
l went back to bring
everything here

404
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:14,951
to see whether it is gonna help.

405
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,456
Secondly, my name is Sing.

406
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:22,785
l am sorry, Sing.
You can just call me Yu.

407
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,561
Yu.

408
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:29,930
But why were you being
outside my gallery so late?

409
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,031
l think it's okay,

410
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,507
let me take you upstairs
to have a rest, tomorrow... ,

411
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:39,703
What are you doing?

412
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,604
Why did you touch
my girlfriend?

413
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:43,739
Who are you?

414
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,443
He is Sing, it's lucky to have
him here just now.

415
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:56,052
Where have you been?
l have been looking for you.

416
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:02,591
Thank you, Sing.

417
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,134
That's okay, you can go now.

418
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:05,593
Thank you.

419
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:16,774
Thank you.

420
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,908
l will treat you dinner,
l will order delivery more often.

421
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,475
Thanks you, Sing.

422
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:23,776
You really scared me, honey.

423
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,186
When l got your SMS,
l returned your call

424
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:25,689
But your cell phone is off and

425
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:26,724
l couldn't get through
the gallery line.

426
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:28,019
So l came back at once.

427
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,560
Yes, l did that purposely.

428
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:30,259
lf not,

429
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:32,159
you would only come back after
the share market is closed.

430
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,256
And l would probably be
crippled at that time.

431
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,862
l will take care of you forever
even if you are crippled.

432
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,862
Sing!

433
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,765
You are out for delivery
so early?

434
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,639
Yeah, the customer... doesn't
want the soup.

435
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,139
Maybe you can have it.

436
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,042
lt'd be useless even
if l bring it back.

437
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:25,578
Will your uncle get
mad on you?

438
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,942
What kind of soup is this?

439
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,186
Chicken feet with dog backbone
(Chinese Medicine).

440
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,780
Dog feet?

441
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,950
Chicken feet with dog backbone
(Chinese Medicine).

442
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:37,551
lt is good for the legs.

443
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,994
Will your uncle get
mad on you?

444
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,092
Thanks.

445
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,760
Okay.

446
00:26:43,835 --> 00:26:45,029
See you.

447
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:47,902
Maybe,

448
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,941
lf you come next time,
l won't charge you.

449
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,337
lt's you?

450
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,737
Sung is not here?

451
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,975
l am not looking for him,
l came here for a drink.

452
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:00,348
What would you like then?

453
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,079
Cappuccino.

454
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:03,177
Okay.

455
00:27:07,158 --> 00:27:08,955
Can l use the internet?

456
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,354
Be my guest.

457
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,099
l am Kelly.

458
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:20,771
l know, Sung has told me.

459
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,131
l am Ching.

460
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:28,268
l will go back to Canada
after two weeks.

461
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:30,982
We are almost done with our saving
on the tuition for studying in Beijing.

462
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:09,709
lt's bored to be alone on Sunday.

463
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,369
l am leaving.

464
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:57,727
l told you to give the phone number
to Sung, not you.

465
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,236
But you key in your number
in my cell phone.

466
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,271
You are so wicked.

467
00:29:02,507 --> 00:29:05,840
Wicked? l forgot to give it
to Sung then l am wicked?

468
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,840
Not giving him the number
is not wicked.

469
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,880
But you peep on other's
information on the net,

470
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,339
that's rascal.

471
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:17,154
As l clicked on it and
that's the first page,

472
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:19,349
l am not doing it on purpose.

473
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,187
That's not an excuse.

474
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,250
Peeping on other's privacy
is a criminal offense.

475
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,394
lt would be great for you
two being in jail together.

476
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,864
Come and talk with me.

477
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,962
l treat you to meal.

478
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,031
Punk, here comes the soup.

479
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:34,935
Dog feet soup.

480
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,439
Dog feet soup? New stuff.

481
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,305
Come on in.

482
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,111
Come in.

483
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:46,848
Your leg is hurt.

484
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:48,852
Be careful...
Look!

485
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,909
Please be careful...

486
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,016
You fix that up.

487
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,826
This is Derek...

488
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,122
Derek Boman

489
00:29:58,163 --> 00:29:59,460
ls he smart?

490
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,499
Having done all these
early in the morning?

491
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,800
You know nothing
about this.

492
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,898
l think his drawing
is a bit erotic.

493
00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:09,871
You better watch out.

494
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:10,805
Maniac.

495
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,435
You just don't care about me.

496
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,511
Sorry.

497
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,414
lf there is anything,
just call me, okay?

498
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,219
lt's almost time for work.

499
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,584
Bye.

500
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,517
Ho, can you pick him up
at the hotel for me?

501
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,193
Too bad, the US stock market
is not stable.

502
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,160
l have to keep
an eye on that.

503
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,222
My leg is hurt badly,why don't
you keep an eye on that?

504
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:38,927
l always peep at you as you are
having a shower, my dear wife.

505
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,037
l am not your wife yet,
still one time to go, maybe...

506
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:47,340
No way, l really do, l...

507
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,344
Don't sing it anymore.

508
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,278
Go for work.

509
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:01,183
Miss Ng, your soup.

510
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,283
Thanks.

511
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:05,529
l will go inside to
get you the money.

512
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:06,586
Okay.

513
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,996
Mis Ng, you'd better not move around
as your leg is still hurt.

514
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:12,296
You guys are all the same.

515
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,632
Just a little sprain.

516
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,169
Thank you.

517
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:24,210
Miss Ng, why do you
want to be a painter?

518
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:26,209
l am not a painter.

519
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,276
l just like painting
so l open this gallery.

520
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,959
How about you? You are
so gentle to be a delivery boy.

521
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,362
ln fact my uncle
owns that restaurant.

522
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:42,126
He told me to help him
for l am not good at my study.

523
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:46,103
He is trying to train me
to behave well.

524
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:52,139
My parents had divorced
since l was small.

525
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,869
lt's my uncle who has been
taking care of me.

526
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,512
Do you have your own dream?

527
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,108
Do you really want to do the
delivery work for the rest of your life?

528
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:05,087
l do have my dream,
l want to be an artiste.

529
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,521
Want to be a star!

530
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,591
ls it?
No.

531
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,128
l just love singing, that's all.

532
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,996
you will understand it later.

533
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:18,934
Miss Ng.

534
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,335
Just call me get the bowl

535
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,037
Bye.

536
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:33,175
Sing, can you do me a favor?

537
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,946
Alright, what is it?

00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:36,646

541
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,717
But l can't go like this.

542
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,951
Can you help me
to bring him here?

543
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:47,429
But my English is lousy...

544
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,192
lt's okay.

545
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:51,064
Do you know mandarin?
He knows a bit mandarin.

546
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:51,624
That'd be alright.

547
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,297
6:30, at the lobby of
Mandarin Hotel.

548
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,267
A foreigner who speaks mandarin.

549
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,304
How's that?

550
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,144
Are you going to have dinner
with me tonight, doc?

551
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,309
Tonight? l have to work.

552
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,713
Yesterday, you said you will
treat me for dinner.

553
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:13,722
l will call you after
work tonight, okay?

554
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,758
l am Kelly, l am not able to answer
your call right now.

555
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,127
Dare you try to leave your message,
l won't call you back.

556
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:52,759
l brought him here.

557
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,489
Mr. Derek Boman,

558
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:55,759

559
00:33:58,503 --> 00:33:59,561
Please call me Derek.

560
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:00,729
Derek.

561
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:05,035
l have seen your work,
you are so very very talented.

562
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,201
Thank you.

563
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:08,575
Do you want to learn
it in UK?

564
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,307
UK? That would be great.

565
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,178
You understand what he said?

566
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,309
Sing, please go back first.

567
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,517
l am busy too.

568
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,355
l do drink a lot of red wine
when l work..

569
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:30,560
Red wine?

570
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,193
Okay, wait.

571
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:33,532
Sing.

572
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:34,628
Yes, what is it?

573
00:34:34,705 --> 00:34:36,400
Can you do me a favor?

574
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,373
Buy a box of red wine
for me, please.

575
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:47,477
l have got some left,
just finish it first.

576
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,417
My friend will bring me
some very soon.

577
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:54,258
Sandra, you do have
an oriental sense.

578
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:55,851
Thanks.

579
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,618
You are very beautiful

580
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,392
Thanks.

581
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,109
Thanks you, Sing.

582
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:16,813
You...want to drink it up?

583
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:20,180
lt's okay,
you may go now.

584
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,844
You don't really know him,

585
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:25,286
it's bad for your health
to drink like that.

586
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:26,721
Stop that, kid.

587
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,225
l will give you the money tomorrow,
please go back.

588
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,326
Let's drink...

589
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,896
This one...

590
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,508
You...

591
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,182
You know what we should
do now?

592
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,746
You should... paint me.

593
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,215
Paint you...

594
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,486
Me, yes.

595
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,788
Okay, sure.

596
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:05,294
l go to...

597
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,524
l go to get the tools.

598
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:08,758
Yes, paint me

599
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,169
Hi, l am Fong Chi Ho.

600
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,709
l am not able to answer
your call right now.

601
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,950
Sandra, you must take
your clothes off!

602
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,591
We should do a nude

603
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,524
ls it?

604
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:37,754
Like me...

605
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,358
l am off from work,
now in Central.

606
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,727
Going to dinner, right?

607
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,626
Will that be too late?
lt is now eleven.

608
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,827
Do you want to eat or not?

609
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,503
Be quick, meet you at the escalator
on Hollywood Road then.

610
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,474
Okay, bye.

611
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,382
Why? Why are you crying?

612
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,655
Just a bit late, you don't
have to cry though.

613
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,358
Are you pregnant or
being dump?

614
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,258
Of course not pregnant!

615
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,726
My boyfriend broke up
with me..

616
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,727
Broke up? That is good,
you can have new one now.

617
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:28,634
How can you be so mean?
l really love him.

618
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,802
How long have you
been together?

619
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,309
We have been together
for over a year.

620
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:38,445
Though he is fat and ugly,
he is a nice person.

621
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:40,907
So l try to be with him then.

622
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,449
l can't imagine that
he would be so cruel to me.

623
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,650
Did he hang out
with other girls?

624
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,885
l've told you that
he is fat and ugly.

625
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,554
lt would be his luck to have me
as his girlfriend.

626
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,095
No other girls will be
interested in him.

627
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:02,867
Stop crying.

628
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,700
Let's go, l am going to
tell you a story.

629
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,472
Come on, let's buy something
to drink.

630
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,412
Let's go

631
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,716
Have a walk and have a good drink,
everything would be fine.

632
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:18,649
Trust me.

633
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,424
l have a friend,

634
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,688
he's been with his girlfriend
for a year and a half.

635
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:28,694
His girlfriend is expecting
to marry him.

636
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,564
But my friend was fed up

637
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:32,795
with their relationship.

638
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,929
And he finally broke up
with her,

639
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:35,733
do you know why?

640
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:36,636
Why?

641
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,608
He told me that
in ancient time,

642
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,042
if you don't bury
the body well,

643
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:44,377
the corpse will be rotten

644
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:45,745
and became harmful to others.

645
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,712
For love,

646
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,151
if you don't end
a rotten relationship,

647
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,083
you are going to hurt
your lover.

648
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:52,850
Love will turn into sympathy.

649
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,413
and it is just a waste
of time.

650
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,153
Sympathy is like the
rotten body,

651
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,691
it's gonna be harmful.

652
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,957
Where did your friend
hear this story?

653
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:02,498
l told him that.

654
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,591
You are very special.

655
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,633
Are you going to
recede this time?

656
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:45,840
You always do that?

657
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,677
Do you often bring
girls here?

658
00:40:58,055 --> 00:40:59,613
What do you expect then?

659
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:03,084
You don't let me
take you home.

660
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,819
Feeling tired and
want to have a rest.

661
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,495
You did make a good choice.

662
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,858
l do, this place is nice.

663
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,561
Come on,

664
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,536
just bury your love then.
l won't.

665
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:16,071
lt's going to rot.

666
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,664
That's you.

667
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,106
Hey, doc, how is it?

668
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,268
How are you doing?
Did your eyes get swollen?

669
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,469
lt's alright.

670
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,509
Trainees should be busy though,

671
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,879
how can you make
your call so often?

672
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,845
Tomorrow is my day-off.

673
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,287
lt's just...

674
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,151
l want to treat you to dinner,
are you available tomorrow?

675
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:10,920
Are you going or not?

676
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,721
Whatever.

677
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,730
l will just count
you in then.

678
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:18,500
Tomorrow night at seven,
l will call you.

679
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:22,097
Who will call so late
at the night?

680
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,834
That's the Prime
Credit Brothers.

681
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,171
See you at seven.

682
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:47,654
Sorry, honey.

683
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,041
Last night,
the US market collapsed,

684
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,633
l don't have time
to take your call.

685
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:13,822
Are you alright?

686
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,056
lt's lucky that Sing
was here,

687
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,591
l have been looking
for you all night.

688
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,789
lt's that bastard again.

689
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,795
Haven't l done anything
for you?

690
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,861
You keep seeing him
so often.

691
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,668
Why is he keep hanging
around you?

692
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,606
As both of you got drunk,
did he try to screw you?

693
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:34,735
Would you mind your words?

694
00:43:34,812 --> 00:43:36,245
You just care about
the market,

695
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,780
do you really care
about me?

696
00:43:37,848 --> 00:43:39,110
Don't l?

697
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,153
l just want to tell you that
the kids now are quite mature.

698
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,281
Nonsense! l don't want to
talk about it.

699
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,062
l don't think l have time
to see you this week.

700
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,257
You check out the new
apartment on your own.

701
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:00,759
And don't hang around
with that kid.

702
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,099
Because you are my girlfriend
and l am your boyfriend.

703
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:14,374
Punk, somebody wrote on
our walls.

704
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,848
ls boss going to
blame on us?

705
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,049
Shouldn't be.

706
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,988
That's nice, never mind.

707
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,023
You guys are here.

708
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,857
l drank a lot last night,

709
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:26,759

710
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,263
l got it...

711
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:30,763
Ching.

712
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,696
l have something to
tell you.

713
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,898
lt's the 99th time,
but l think...

714
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,998
l got it,
come on in.

715
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,102
Sung.

716
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:16,305
Sing.

717
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:17,072
lt's hot.

718
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,138
No one wants the
soup again?

719
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,683
Yeah, it's for you.
That's hot.

720
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,117
Miss Ng of the studio
doesn't want it..

721
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,381
What is it?

722
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:26,047
Ginseng with kudzu vine.

723
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:28,848
lt's good, it relieves
your hang over.

724
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,887
Ginseng with kudzu vine?

725
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:34,259
Alright, l will have it,
how much?

726
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,160
No need, enjoy it.

727
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,326
Thanks... honey,
here is the soup.

728
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,132
Ginseng with kudzu vine.

729
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:42,968
lt is good to your brian
and recovers my energy.

730
00:45:43,774 --> 00:45:45,071
But it's hot, be careful.

731
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:48,834
You... drank a lot?

732
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,851
Sorry.

733
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,414
l don't know you will
bring me soup...

734
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,188
Maybe you order
a drink instead.

735
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,119
Okay.

736
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,024
Thanks for last night.

737
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,224
That's okay.

738
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,301
Are you free tonight?

739
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,199
What? l am free.

740
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,339
l would like to
have dinner with you.

741
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,399
Great.

742
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:28,508
Sir.

743
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,786
l help you with
the soup, okay?

744
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,080
Okay.

745
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:41,054
You always peep on us
outside the studio?

746
00:46:43,033 --> 00:46:44,500
Well, l...

747
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,930
l like you.

748
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,308
Kid, do you know what
you are talking about?

749
00:47:02,953 --> 00:47:04,944
Have you ever hate
your parents?

750
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:06,988
Why should l?

751
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:09,582
They separated without caring
about your feeling.

752
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:11,860
Don't you hate them?

753
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,458
l don't.

754
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:20,330
At least they separated
when l was small.

755
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,006
Otherwise,

756
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,899
l will be so upset.

757
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,441
l do think that once
people get married,

758
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,275
they shouldn't have
a divorce.

759
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,180
lf they do, why should
they get married?

760
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,086
You have seen my fiance.

761
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:39,053
What do you think
about him?

762
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:46,587
Your finace... is smart,
handsome and nice.

763
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,932
What? You want to
break up with him?

764
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,137
After last night incident,

765
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,503
l don't think
l need him anymore.

766
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:03,909
l need someone who really
loves me and cares about me.

767
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:06,377
And he will do
anything for me.

768
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:08,943
Yes.

769
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,646
He will care about me,

770
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,549
when l am angry with him

771
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:14,590
Bnd everything will be
back to usual soon

772
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:18,288
l do wonder that

773
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,262
if the stock market and
l are both in danger,

774
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,298
will he help me
out first?

775
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,558
Of course, he can't do anything
about the stock market.

776
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,434
Have you got
a make-up mirror?

777
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:32,668
What for?

778
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,136
Take it out.

779
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:40,874
Open it.

780
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,519
Put it on the table,
face to yourself.

781
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:47,950
Now you close your eyes,

782
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:54,461
imagine there is a devil
on your left

783
00:48:56,166 --> 00:48:58,225
and an angel
on your right.

784
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:04,165
Which side will be
your fiance on?

785
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:07,337
After that, take the mirror,

786
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,242
you will have the answer.

787
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,522
Thanks, you are great.

788
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:31,267
l used to do this
whenever l am in trouble.

789
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:34,302
Hope you don't
find it stupid.

790
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,009
You have got the answer,
mabe l...

791
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,676
bring you to a place
to cheer up.

792
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,474
Where?

793
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,376
You will know
as you get there.

794
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,285
Mr. Yeung,
this way please.

795
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,029
Thanks...

796
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,431
Thank you for coming
to my show tonight.

797
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:07,730
Before you leave,
l give you guys a riddle.

798
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,431
You guys will get a nice pose
when taking photo,

799
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,064
that's a famous female.

800
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,665
Lovely queen.

801
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:14,370
No...

802
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:15,069
Sailormoon.
Sailormoon.

803
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,373
lt's not Sailormoon.

804
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:18,311
How about at the back?
Do you know the answer?

805
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,175
Wait.

806
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,587
Just stay here,
l will be back soon.

807
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,322
l have seen
a beautiful girl.

808
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,022
Hey! lt's you!

809
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,220
You come for the show?

810
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:34,387
But we are over.

811
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:35,692
Over?

812
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:37,666
lt's over.
lt's over.

813
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,224
l do charge you though.

814
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,635
You come to see me,
do you know who l am?

815
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:43,729
Handsome guy?

816
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,104
Handsome...

817
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,239
Dare you say that.

818
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:48,675
You still have to pay
even you say that.

819
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:51,347
lt's obvious that
she's not coming for me.

820
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:54,384
Well, here comes
our next performer.

821
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,282
Our in-house singer.

822
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:57,513
Sing!

823
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,096
You are really nice.

824
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:18,862
Thanks...

825
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,630
Can we take a picture?

826
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,534
Maybe next time,
my friends are...

827
00:52:23,607 --> 00:52:26,167
l have another
show on 24th here.

828
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,574
Okay? See you then.

829
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,271
Bye.
Bye.

830
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:33,714
You sang well.

831
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,674
And you do have
lots of fans.

832
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:37,549
l already said you
want to be a star.

833
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,750
Let's go.

834
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:47,259
l have a show on X'mas
Eve at 3am,

835
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:47,796
are you coming?

836
00:52:47,864 --> 00:52:49,559
X'mas Eve? Okay.

837
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,498
Have you ever been
to my uncle's restaurant?

838
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,596
No, maybe next time.

839
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,572
Maybe l take you home.

840
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:02,737
Okay.

841
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,645
Will your boyfriend be there?

842
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:09,810
l don't think so,
we had a fight this morning.

843
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,863
Excuse me, Mr. Yeung,
we are about to close.

844
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:28,831
Check please.

845
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:34,835
l have a great time tonight,
thanks for accompanying me.

846
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,015
Thanks for taking me home.

847
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:48,871
Kelly, why are you
leaving so early?

848
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:52,642
Well, l have to meet
my friends in other place.

849
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:57,586
l have a fatal disease,
only you can help me.

850
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:02,016
l will wait for you
at the disco until you come.

851
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,798
Look at this,
it's interesting.

852
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:53,859
Yeah, maybe we should
draw something on it.

853
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:54,732
Do you have a pen?

854
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,772
Who is it?
l will call the police.

855
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,738
Let's go.

856
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,604
Come on,
t's been scrawled already.

857
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:01,434
Bro, don't touch my wall.

858
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:02,808
Your patient is recovered,
go out and have a walk.

859
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,073
Let's go...

860
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,136
Please, get going.

861
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:09,818
No way, it's getting worse.

862
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,784
ls it blackmail
by the triad?

863
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:13,611
Do you owe someone money?

864
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:15,452
Let's report
this to the police.

865
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:17,686
Go ahead. He said he would
call the police just now.

866
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:18,952
You'd better leave.

867
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,191
lt's just number,
not foul language.

868
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:27,692
But it does look like something
as you look at it carefully.

869
00:58:33,743 --> 00:58:35,870
l have to go, you guys
look great tonight.

870
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:45,083
Bro, you look great...

871
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:49,819
You guys too...

872
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:02,668
Why are you here?

873
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,764
l told you
l always peep at you.

874
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,665
Don't you need to work?

875
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,045
Sorry, honey.

876
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,008
l know what l said that
day was too much.

877
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:15,175
l know l have been
neglecting you.

878
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:17,776
So l haven taken
a two-month leave.

879
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:20,789
And we can enjoy
the holiday.

880
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,085
Okay?

881
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:25,889
Did you put it on
for me?

882
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:27,156
lsn't it pretty?

883
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:30,522
Don't you know how to care
about other's feeling?

884
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,565
l do.

885
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:37,538
l am trying hard to
be a good boyfriend.

886
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:40,167
l have been working hard
for our future.

887
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:42,805
This is the...

888
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:49,314
Sorry, you can't give me
the thing that l want.

889
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:57,315
Just tell me what
you want then?

890
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:01,819
You tell me and
l will do my best.

891
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,793
This is the 100th
time proposal...

892
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:07,700
You promised me that you will
marry me, l do love you.

893
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:12,339
Ho.

894
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:13,898
That's not the point,

895
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,842
something is missing
between us.

896
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,174
Don't you understand?

897
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,810
Sorry. We are over.

898
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:28,382
Maybe we need some time
to calm down.

899
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,285
l am going to
work now.

900
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:33,622
l know l haven't been with
you for quite a while.

901
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,793
Would you please
give me a chance?

902
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,835
Please, okay?

903
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:08,856
As l came just now,

904
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,296
there was a soup and
a bunch of flower.

905
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,032
And l took them in.

906
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,982
Look, it's great.

907
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:33,821
Stupid! You still
said it's great?

908
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,050
We don't have much
saving this month.

909
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:38,116
Self-tour in Europe,
thirty thousand will do.

910
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:39,955
Did you hear what
l said?

911
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,223
l said we don't save much
at all for this month

912
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:42,821
and you are still
planning for a trip.

913
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:45,697
ln fact, since we can't save much,
let's have a trip then.

914
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,229
What the hell! We have planned
for a two-year saving.

915
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,295
This is the third year,
and the fourth year is coming.

916
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,068
You are not going to
graduate until thirty.

917
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:54,075
Business is bad and
that's not my fault.

918
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:54,939
Ask Hung

919
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:56,876
to help you out then.

920
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:58,311
We promised not to talk
about him again.

921
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,910
Okay, l am going to
call Hung now.

922
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:08,481
Hung.

923
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:11,216
l would like to go to Beijing,
please buy me a ticket.

924
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,952
Okay, when are you
planning to go?

925
01:02:13,262 --> 01:02:14,889
24th, it's a good day.

926
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,398
Alright, l will fax you
the itinerary tomorrow.

927
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:19,128
Thanks, bye.

928
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:21,433
You go back alone.

929
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:33,438
Did you call him?

930
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,251
Did you do as
l told you?

931
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:43,024
l did, everything is done.

932
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,193
l've been role-playing that
l almost forgot who l am.

933
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:47,161
He is not that bad though.

934
01:02:48,397 --> 01:02:50,262
Don't be soft-hearted,

935
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:52,324
he did the same
to me before.

936
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:55,164
He is bad,
he's a swindler.

937
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:56,535
He won't change.

938
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,172
Never.

939
01:02:58,241 --> 01:03:01,108
Trust me,
he won't change.

940
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:03,805
Do you really like him?
No way!

941
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:06,246
Just help me to date
him out.

942
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,081
l want to fix him up
on X'mas Eve,

943
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:10,278
got it?

944
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:20,818
Yanka, l would like to
ask you a favor.

945
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:37,375
Joe, are you coming later?

946
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:39,447
l am having a headache.

947
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,114
Can you bring me
some pills?

948
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:45,044
And buy me some milk please.

949
01:03:45,922 --> 01:03:47,150
Okay, thanks.

950
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:54,925
How are you doing?

951
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:55,554
Thank you.

952
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,098
Milk.

953
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,463
Your pills.

954
01:03:58,601 --> 01:03:59,192
No need...
l don't have change.

955
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,428
That's okay.

956
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,561
Where is Kelly?

957
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,002
Over there.

958
01:04:03,072 --> 01:04:04,232
Thank you.

959
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:18,815
My cousin has a wedding
party on 24th.

960
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,117
Are you coming?

961
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,279
Okay.

962
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:26,817
You don't have to go
if you don't want to.

963
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,056
l do, why not.

964
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,358
l will even take
a day off for that.

965
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:31,024
lt would be nice to get
to know your friends.

966
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:34,198
There is nothing special
about my friends.

967
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:37,965
lf you are busy, you really
don't have to go.

968
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,530
That's oaky,
l will go for sure.

969
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:53,217
Why don't you go inside
to eat?

970
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:57,551
l am not used to go to
place like this.

971
01:04:58,194 --> 01:04:59,923
But you do order delivery
so often?

972
01:04:59,996 --> 01:05:01,395
The food is really
good though.

973
01:05:02,265 --> 01:05:05,359
You have to compromise
to something that you like.

974
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:07,493
Just take a seat to
enjoy your food.

975
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,097
Don't you need
to perform tonight?

976
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,407
l would rather stay
with you

977
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,466
l don't want to
be like Ho,

978
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:17,273
he cares nothing about you
but only about his work.

979
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:21,141
Can you stop comparing
with Ho?

980
01:05:22,952 --> 01:05:26,353
What would you like,
Ho become more attentive or

981
01:05:26,422 --> 01:05:27,946
l become more mature?

982
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,288
Do you understand
what l am saying?

983
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:36,194
We haven't talked
much since that night.

984
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:39,127
Maybe we are going too fast.

985
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:41,226
We don't know each other
that well?

986
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,965
l will work hard and l will
give you everything,

987
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,066
l will love you dearly...

988
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,406
l will find another job...

989
01:05:48,477 --> 01:05:50,411
lf you like,
l will go back to study...

990
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,274
You are still young.

991
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:55,277
You are going to experience
different things

992
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,444
and people.

993
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,545
Since that night,
l know you are the one.

994
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,954
You are my destiny,
l won't like others.

995
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:04,083
You are going to have
different girlfriends.

996
01:06:04,593 --> 01:06:07,323
Maybe you don't even remember
who l am whey you get older.

997
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:08,522
How would l...

998
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:10,497
l have been watching and
loving you for so long.

999
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:12,090
You just peeped at me.

1000
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:15,501
That's not love.

1001
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,372
What do you know, kid?

1002
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,288
Sung, you are off already?

1003
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:14,289
Yeah.

1004
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:17,763
l just want to have
a chat though.

1005
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,103
lf you don't mind,
we can chat here.

1006
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,818
ls Ching here?

1007
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:40,311
She left already,
you want to chat with her?

1008
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:49,324
Sing.

1009
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:52,031
l think l can't
help you today.

1010
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,466
l just had a quarrel
with Ching.

1011
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:58,129
But you can come back
in two days,

1012
01:07:58,207 --> 01:07:59,435
l am gonna help you.

1013
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:34,807
Why are looking at
my stuff?

1014
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,575
l am checking the name
and date for you.

1015
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,318
l leave my luggage here.

1016
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:50,551
l will come back
to take it.

1017
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:51,354
Please don't touch that.

1018
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:14,882
Should l give him
the painting?

1019
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:18,550
l am afraid he will think that
l am teasing on him.

1020
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,278
For not saving enough money
for studying in Beijing.

1021
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:24,392
What's up to you guys?

1022
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:25,692
l don't know

1023
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:27,592
whether he has ever thought
about our future.

1024
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,655
We are saving hard
for the tuition fee

1025
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,530
and he just spent
it casually.

1026
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:34,458
Here is your delivery.

1027
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:43,672
Seventy five dollars.

1028
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:48,809
Just call me get the bowl back
as you finish the soup.

1029
01:10:58,621 --> 01:10:59,610
Ching.

1030
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:02,384
ln the past three years,
l have been so happy.

1031
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:06,361
l am sorry
for my fooling around

1032
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:09,897
and l forgot
about my promise.

1033
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:13,233
l think l really have
to graduate after thirty.

1034
01:11:13,669 --> 01:11:16,433
But l do hope you can
fulfill your dream soon.

1035
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,566
Here is the money
we have been saving up..

1036
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:21,799
lt should be enough
for you.

1037
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,241
Although you didn't say you
want to break up with me.

1038
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:26,377
As l saw Hung holding
your hands,

1039
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:28,575
and he bought the ticket
for you,

1040
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:30,585
l know l am not good enough
for you,

1041
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,787
he knows how to love you.

1042
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:36,450
And the numbers is the song
that you like most.

1043
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:38,389
l am going to sing
it to you again,

1044
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:40,857
you can listen to
it when you get bored.

1045
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:44,291
Study hard, my dear.

1046
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:48,826
l don't have the chance to wait
for the blossom of our love.

1047
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:55,708
l have been waiting
for your rescue.

1048
01:11:55,778 --> 01:12:01,876
Hoping that the fireworks
would last forever.

1049
01:12:02,384 --> 01:12:06,753
Making you feel insecure,
adoration will be fading away.

1050
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:11,691
How long would
the appearance last?

1051
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:17,731
Starting to surmise as suspicion arise,
it will soon be replaced.

1052
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:22,635
You do care about
my seldom applause.

1053
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:23,897
You sing really well.

1054
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:25,803
Santa Claus is going
off duty.

1055
01:12:25,874 --> 01:12:27,569
Let's go for the
X'mas carol.

1056
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:30,807
Do you think she
will come, boss?

1057
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:33,740
Definitely,
have you ever heard...

1058
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:37,047
if you believe,
everything is impossible.

1059
01:12:37,886 --> 01:12:39,478
l think she is in Beijing now.

1060
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:41,384
You even know Santa
Claus is in Beijing?

1061
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:44,349
l mean Ching.

1062
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:46,085
Ching? Beijing?

1063
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:47,924
Aren't you two going together?

1064
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,565
l... don't have enough money.

1065
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:54,466
What are you doing
here then?

1066
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,401
Waiting for Ching.

1067
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:57,803
You said she is Beijing?

1068
01:12:58,507 --> 01:13:00,873
l wrote some shorthand
code on the wall.

1069
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:04,002
l told her to go to the place
where we first met on X'mas Eve.

1070
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:06,037
lf she sees that,
she will come.

1071
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:08,647
You guys have a quarrel!

1072
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:10,942
How do you know she can
read your code?

1073
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,119
We've learnt that when
we were small.

1074
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:14,917
When you were small?

1075
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,555
Should everyone know what
you are thinking about?

1076
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,958
You are just doing the things
that you like,

1077
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,428
did you care about others?

1078
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:25,928
Codes, signs?

1079
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:27,525
You ask for it.

1080
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,185
What is it?

1081
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,128
Maybe l shouldn't go in, huh?

1082
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,421
Why? We are at the door.

1083
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:59,634
lt's not going to
be fun though,

1084
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:01,760
l just want to be with you
on X'mas Eve.

1085
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:04,538
Never mind, just leave the gift
then we go, okay?

1086
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,403
Come on.

1087
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:09,135
ls it here?

1088
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:14,846
l am telling you,
your X'mas wish...

1089
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:17,846
is going to be fulfilled,
you are gonna lose it.

1090
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:19,850
Sad?

1091
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,719
Couple, got it?

1092
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:25,918
Can you take it?
lt's tough.

1093
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:30,163
You hate long hair?
l can cut it.

1094
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,692
l found a beautiful
gal here.

1095
01:14:34,903 --> 01:14:37,963
A beautiful girl must have a lot of
things to do on X'mas eve.

1096
01:14:38,774 --> 01:14:39,536
l don't.

1097
01:14:39,608 --> 01:14:40,973
Do you recognize me?

1098
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,843
But Sing is not here yet.

1099
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:47,773
Are you going to sit here
and wait?

1100
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:49,211
Yes.

1101
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:52,014
Give her a big hand then.

1102
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,519
Thanks, merry X'mas.

1103
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:15,735
Joe.

1104
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:17,570
Why are you so late?

1105
01:15:17,646 --> 01:15:19,238
You look great tonight.

1106
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,277
Thanks.

1107
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,714
Kathy and Rachel,
you know them.

1108
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:27,554
Haven't seen you for long.

1109
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,852
Who is your cousin?

1110
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,026
Joe, l have something
to tell you.

1111
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:44,199
What?

1112
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:51,640
Listen, our passion is gone.

1113
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:56,982
And our love will soon
transform to sympathy.

1114
01:15:57,753 --> 01:16:01,211
lt'll be getting worse.

1115
01:16:03,025 --> 01:16:04,856
Now you know what
l felt that day.

1116
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:13,698
You deserve this.

1117
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:17,171
l almost forgot,
l have a X'mas gift for you.

1118
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,267
A doctor trainee sells illegal drugs in the disco.

1119
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:34,951
Ching.

1120
01:16:35,023 --> 01:16:37,753
Why are you crying alone
on X'mas eve?

1121
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,795
Have you seen my honey?

1122
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:42,858
Honey? Me?

1123
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:44,990
Sung, he has left.

1124
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:47,001
He did not.

1125
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:52,930
He told me that he left
already in his recording.

1126
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:54,805
He did.

1127
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:59,176
No, Santa Claus won't lie.

1128
01:17:00,248 --> 01:17:01,306
You are really rush.

1129
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:02,907
Where is he?

1130
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:05,585
He told you to study,
he really cares about you.

1131
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,212
Why should you find him?

1132
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:08,688
Studying is good.

1133
01:17:08,757 --> 01:17:10,224
Uncle, you don't understand.

1134
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,759
Studying alone is meaningless.

1135
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:12,919
Please tell me
where is he?

1136
01:17:12,995 --> 01:17:15,156
Studying alone is meaningless.?

1137
01:17:15,864 --> 01:17:17,195
How romantic!

1138
01:17:17,833 --> 01:17:19,801
Come on, where is he?

1139
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,597
lt's all on the wall,
look it up yourself.

1140
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,262
Why did you hiy me?

1141
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:24,361
What did he write?

1142
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:27,374
Have you learnt that before?
That's shorthand code.

1143
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:30,234
The romantic place,

1144
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:33,338
the first X'mas Eve, we...

1145
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:41,182
Kelly...

1146
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:42,381
Kelly...

1147
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:46,960
l am sorry, l don't know
it'll turn out like this.

1148
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:50,021
All of them said you are bad,
so l helped them.

1149
01:17:50,098 --> 01:17:51,690
l do know that
you know Maggie.

1150
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:56,664
Prime Credit Brothers
told me that.

1151
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:57,796
We have been together
for year and a half,

1152
01:17:57,873 --> 01:17:59,272
how couldn't l recognize
her voice?

1153
01:18:01,410 --> 01:18:03,275
Why did you come then?

1154
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:11,676
l did cheat you,

1155
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:15,686
but l know nothing
about the magazine.

1156
01:18:16,792 --> 01:18:18,282
l don't care.

1157
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:22,059
Every couple would keep
their own secrets, right?

1158
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,392
As long as the love
is true will do.

1159
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,199
No one knows about the future.

1160
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:31,738
But you are the one that
l have been thinking of.

1161
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:52,793
l will go back
to Canada tomorrow.

1162
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,023
Sorry.

1163
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,027
So many things
happened lately,

1164
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:04,463
it's not going to settle
that in one day.

1165
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:27,248
Don't you need to perform?

1166
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:30,223
l don't have the mood
to sing though...

1167
01:20:30,292 --> 01:20:31,520
l don't want to go.

1168
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:36,289
Sing, who do think you are?

1169
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:38,924
Even a superstar should be
responsible to his fans.

1170
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,796
Come on.

1171
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:41,836
Have you ever thought
of your loved one?

1172
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:44,530
No matter what,

1173
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:46,904
you can share your feeling
with her?

1174
01:21:32,087 --> 01:21:33,247
Didn't you leave already?

1175
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:36,287
No way!

1176
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,287
lt's for you.

1177
01:21:51,506 --> 01:21:53,201
Why are you holding a broom...

1178
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:56,041
To hit Hung

1179
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,907
So easy to get angry?

1180
01:22:08,957 --> 01:22:10,356
Let me give you a kiss.

1181
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:45,658
Sorry, honey.

1182
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,485
Sorry, honey.

1183
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:39,712
Who would dare to
let you choose now.

1184
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:46,381
Or l am just pretending for

1185
01:23:48,556 --> 01:23:53,050
l am too nervous.

1186
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:58,527
Be brave and

1187
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:11,539
date you for lunch.

1188
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:18,816
Although l am not
smart enough,

1189
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:26,255
l dare to make my move
at once.

1190
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:33,023
l will buy you flowers and

1191
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:40,765
l will do my best.

1192
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,597
l am sorry for what
happened last time.

1193
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,294
lt's for you.

1194
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,259
This wedding is real.

1195
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:10,798
Congratulations.

1196
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:12,134
Thanks.

1197
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:15,307
Yes, did the medical board
check you up?

1198
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:17,840
lt's over now,
l did nothing at all.

1199
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:20,678
l became so popular
in the hospital now.

1200
01:25:21,382 --> 01:25:23,816
That's great, girls
will approach to you.

1201
01:25:25,854 --> 01:25:27,788
l should say sorry to you.

1202
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,257
l will handle well
with my love,

1203
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:31,750
it won't be that messy again.

1204
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:37,531
Well, Kelly will be
my bridemaid.

1205
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:39,729
You better handle that well.

1206
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:43,168
Come earlier on that day, bye.

1207
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:44,262
Bye.

1208
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:28,675
How is it, gal?

1209
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,708
You have been coming here
everyday in this month.

1210
01:26:30,785 --> 01:26:34,482
Just looking at the soup menu
without order anything.

1211
01:26:34,556 --> 01:26:37,548
What kind of soup
do you like?

1212
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:57,605
l stop peeping at you.

1213
01:27:01,749 --> 01:27:03,512
You don't have soup lately,

1214
01:27:03,585 --> 01:27:04,847
you look bad.

1215
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:06,547
Just drink it up.

1216
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:08,822
What soup is this?

1217
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,821
Soup with Lotus seeds and Lilies.

1218
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:23,761
Just drink it up.

1219
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,586
What is it?
ls there thief or cockroach?

1220
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:47,258
The phone!

1221
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:49,328
You just answer it.

1222
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:51,856
Maybe it's calling from Hung.

1223
01:27:54,068 --> 01:27:55,501
He is your friend.

1224
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:57,629
He must be looking for
you then.

1225
01:27:58,473 --> 01:27:59,701
You answer it.

1226
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:06,405
l have something
to tell you

1227
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:09,774
Please hold on.

1228
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:14,487
You can talk now.

1229
01:28:15,523 --> 01:28:17,252
l want you to
come to Beijing.

1230
01:28:17,825 --> 01:28:19,258
For what?

1231
01:28:19,594 --> 01:28:21,687
We have enough money
for studying in Beijing.

1232
01:28:22,063 --> 01:28:23,690
Okay, it's just business.

1233
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:25,926
Don't get too excited,
l told my father...

1234
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,730
about the counselling cafe
you run in HK,

1235
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:29,997
unfortunately...

1236
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:31,561
He likes this idea.

1237
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:33,300
He would like to have one
in the hotel.

1238
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:35,638
He said it would work,
what do you think?

1239
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:38,536
We have to think about it.

1240
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:39,937
Still need to think?

1241
01:28:40,948 --> 01:28:41,915
We made it.

1242
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,008
We can use our saving to go
for a Europe tour.

1243
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:46,781
Then we have to learn Mandarin
before going to Beijing.

1244
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:47,885
Okay.

1245
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:49,388
She lied to me.

1246
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:53,554
l like her as l first saw
her in the disco.

1247
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:54,959
She lied to me though.

1248
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:57,497
lt seems that you first
lied to my cousin.

1249
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,535
l am serious
in every romance.

1250
01:29:04,605 --> 01:29:07,574
And it just doesn't
work out at last.

1251
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:08,836
She lied to me though.

1252
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:16,475
in fact, love can't be...

1253
01:29:17,785 --> 01:29:19,013
Counted.

1254
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:22,645
No need to count, and...

1255
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:24,548
Let me.

1256
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:29,556
You go ahead!

1257
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:32,626
Tell me when did you
start liking me?

1258
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:38,129
You didn't like me on the first
night we met at the disco.

1259
01:29:38,606 --> 01:29:40,369
l did see you are flirting
with another girl.

1260
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:42,498
That's not me for sure.

1261
01:29:42,577 --> 01:29:44,807
l am going to
tell you that...

1262
01:29:45,813 --> 01:29:52,719
it's not important that
who cheats in love.

1263
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:56,885
lt is not important for
when did it start.

1264
01:29:57,425 --> 01:29:58,585
Do you love him?

1265
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:00,960
When should l call you?

1266
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:02,893
No one knows
about the future.

1267
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:04,827
But you are the one
l have been thinking of.

1268
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:07,662
Do you love him?

1269
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:22,076
That's perfect

1270
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:24,948
No such word in madarin?

1271
01:30:25,019 --> 01:30:26,043
Wrong again!

1272
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:29,419
l like someone but
l am afraid that...

1273
01:30:30,491 --> 01:30:33,153
How many relationships
have you ever had?

1274
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:35,789
l don't remember.

1275
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,889
Why don't you have
the courage to love?

1276
01:30:40,835 --> 01:30:42,132
l am older than him and

1277
01:30:42,203 --> 01:30:45,730
he thinks that l am more
educated and richer than him.

1278
01:30:47,675 --> 01:30:49,609
Don't you know him?

1279
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:50,938
Of course l do

1280
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:55,015
Actually you know me too.

1281
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:58,742
He is now 21 and
l am 27.

1282
01:30:59,253 --> 01:31:02,120
Both we are young,
there'd be fine.

1283
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:05,921
But after twenty years,
he is only 41 and l am already 47.

1284
01:31:06,594 --> 01:31:11,156
Another thirty years, you are
77 and he also will reach 7 1 .

1285
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:13,222
l think you guys

1286
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:15,732
shouldn't worry too much
about your future.

1287
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:17,994
Otherwise

1288
01:31:18,072 --> 01:31:20,597
you will keep worrying about
your future endlessly.

1289
01:31:21,676 --> 01:31:23,439
lt would be wise to enjoy

1290
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:26,241
the moment you are
with him now.

1291
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:28,943
Although l don't understand,

1292
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:31,541
we are going to keep
our love forever.

1293
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:32,711
Cheers.

1294
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:54,500
